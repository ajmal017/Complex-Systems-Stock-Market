2 2018-10-12 23:59:40 That has been the history of US - Saudi Arabia relationship. US has been willing to overlook "controversial" aspects of the kingdom as long as it keeps oil flowing and they keep supporting US national security policies.

38 2018-10-12 23:57:12 It was nice seeing you today at Genesis. I would like to ask that gasoline be discounted for veterans and the military. Hotels and motels gives veterans and military discounts of 15%.  I don't see why Trump can't ask oil and gas companies to allow us a discount.
39 2018-10-12 23:57:10 In Hoi4 there is no reason to use motorized divisions with tanks.  Use cavalry.  It's faster than the tanks, has roughly the same stats as motorized, and doesn't require oil.
40 2018-10-12 23:57:09 Be real. We sacrificed our morality for oil in the decades-long run-up to 9-11 as the Saudis sponsored terrorism around the world. 9-11 should have been the last straw. Yemen also. So, sure, punish them for Khashoggi. Cut them off for 100 years of mayhem.

42 2018-10-12 23:57:05 I don’t live in Beverly Hills but I remember when they shut down the oil well next door due to safety concerns, I believe  methane played a part in that decision. Drilling a tunnel under a high school on a methane field seems worth protesting.

This news does not make me feel well. I shall inform the troops. This news with either inspire them or make them wet their trousers. Either way we will give it our best effort!

P.s. send squirrel oil to the front line.
44 2018-10-12 23:56:48 Unfortunately, Canada - home to the third largest proven oil reserves in the world - still imports 75,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia. Tweets are one way to show concern. Money is another. I'm guessing Saudi Arabia cares more about the latter than the former.
45 2018-10-12 23:56:46 Barack & Michelle Obama will ALWAYS have my respect. They are thoughtful, intelligent, and kind people that fought hard to make this country a prosperous and safe place for ALL. Kanye tries, but he's fallen for Trump's snake oil. Trump is simply self interested & deranged

48 2018-10-12 23:56:40 Main reasons the separatists cratered. Quebec on its alone saddled with it's share of the Federal debt & no transfer payments from TROC would be Venezuela w/o oil. Greece w/o warm beaches. No more cheap daycare & uni tuition. Just hard times.

53 2018-10-12 23:55:37 Jim pisses oil, so whatevs.
54 2018-10-12 23:55:31 Yup, me too.  My parents thought I was allergic to fat or fried foods when I was young.  Turns out I only have issues with industrial fats such as canola oil.
55 2018-10-12 23:55:25 Sure but not necessary. ..we get a mere 14 tilts tomorrow
56 2018-10-12 23:55:06 fun fact the freezing point of olive oil is 36° Fahrenheit do do with that information however you want
57 2018-10-12 23:55:02 The oil lubricates the moving parts in an internal combustion engine

No pistons, no cylinders, no friction, no need for lubrication
58 2018-10-12 23:55:02 No doctors, scientists crossing illegally. The ones who are have less education, skills than Americans on bottom of income scale. In terms of services, schools, housing, hospitals they cost the same but contribute far less. It's an economic fact.

71 2018-10-12 23:53:17 I was working in the oil and gasfields at Moomba during the America's Cup victory, watching tv outside our dongas showing the boat returning to port with loudspeakers blasting that song out.
72 2018-10-12 23:53:08 Had my car looked at today and it had absolutely no oil or water in it and was a few days away from blowing up. Lovely stuff x
73 2018-10-12 23:52:57 Coconut oil for me personally. Lather myself up, buy myself a nice sleeping bag, and slither like a slug. 

Bonus points for me if I fill it up with gelatin, corn syrup and cut the end of the bag to leave a mucus trail behind you as your parents try to beat you with a salted bat.

79 2018-10-12 23:52:16 It is known as neutral taxation. The same rate applies to emission reduction measures and the extra gas revenues we earn when emissions are reduced. So, the same choice for oil companies as for others.

90 2018-10-12 23:51:15 But, apparently, you can buy Ted Cruz. NRA, Oil & Gas industry, Telecommunications companies, Health Insurance entities, Koch Industries all give heavily to Ted’s campaign. They are who he works for.
91 2018-10-12 23:51:12 Earlier you said the tax rate was higher now you're saying they use oil monies to pay for healthcare which they don't. Why can't you just admit you're making things up to fit your worldview?

95 2018-10-12 23:50:39 *MY* thought: redirect fossil fuel subsidies to renewal energy market. Conduct job retraining so coal workers, oil workers, etc. become solar & wind workers. Result: more/better jobs, energy costs go down, environment improves, we stop shedding blood for oil, and we tell SA to

104 2018-10-12 23:49:19 i have yea, the past week or so i noticed under my car. at first i thought it was coolant bc it’s always been a problem with my car but it definitely was oil too bc it was a few quarts empty when i went in to get my oil changed this morning

110 2018-10-12 23:48:58 what nobody told him was it's about oil/gas pipelines
111 2018-10-12 23:48:56 As a kid, I hated when I had to get rubbed down in castor oil and vicks but as an adult? I TRULY appreciate TF out of it. Omfg. It's a life saver.
112 2018-10-12 23:48:50 A lie. Why? Because the TMX pipeline wouldn't have been bringing oil to market before end of 2019 even before the delays. And the KXL delays are in the US.

So this discount has ZERO to do with our pipeline policies. 

He's lying. Again.

#abpoli #ableg
113 2018-10-12 23:48:45 And also supposedly the "420" buyer for Tesla.  It's great that the Sauda Arabian govt is trying to give up its reliance on oil; once they have that fixed, maybe they can give up their reliance on killing people.
114 2018-10-12 23:48:38 There was a book called "House of Bush, House of Saud" that came out in 2004 that explains the relationship between the families and their dynasties. 

In short, oil. But it goes deeper than just that as well. 

It is illuminating and disturbing.
115 2018-10-12 23:48:28 Me & Pisces are like oil & water  We just don’t get along smh
116 2018-10-12 23:48:22 Thanks for triggering my eating disorder. Once I heard the word corn I immediately associated it with popcorn. So now I’m eating a big bowl of popcorn.  No worries, I poured olive oil all over it so now it’s healthy 
117 2018-10-12 23:48:05 You're the only one mentioning using our oil to pay for social programs. We're just proposing changing what we spend current tax revenue on. The one thing we should really emulate from the Nordic Model is the concept of Lagom.
118 2018-10-12 23:47:47 How does an oil change cost less than changing a cabin or engine air filter in a car. I was able to change both the filters in about 15 minutes, can’t say the same would happen with oil
119 2018-10-12 23:47:46 Fuck you Patchouli oil. That shit needs to be banished from the earth.
120 2018-10-12 23:47:36 Will be back the week world is still hungry for oil .
121 2018-10-12 23:47:35 Sadly, no POTUS, Dem or Rep, will take a stand against Saudi Arabia. There’s too much at stake, financially. The US turns a blind eye to the Saudi’s hand in terrorism, globally, in favor of our dependence on their oil and money. It sucks.
122 2018-10-12 23:47:34 I love ummmm.

131 2018-10-12 23:46:26 Cant see how you have a "significant" oil  leak and never seen a huge puddle on ground or oil pressure light hasn't come on from lack of oil.  I've driven cars for years that you had to add a quart every few weeks

Each one develops at thr own speed, BUT, if they make the team build them up not down!

151 2018-10-12 23:44:32 Give me a break , here's some physics,  it takes just as much power to move a Tesla as any internal combustion engine, either you generate from nuclear coal or oil plants. Or you burn gas
152 2018-10-12 23:44:18 I've noticed in all of these models, you don't seem to include (or display) the diffusion pump's 'christmas tree' jet assembly.. is that a negligible component in thermal modeling?

I would think that, like, oil droplet condensation splattering might have a significant effect
153 2018-10-12 23:44:13 Who created this regime? Isn’t it the result of CIA destroying the only democracy in ME in 1953 in favor of cheap oil? Also, the murderer of journalists, Saudi Barbaria, and the most ruthless prison master, Israel, are not baskets of roses either. What does an Ex-CIA know anyway?
154 2018-10-12 23:44:13 You know my feelings on the supposed lack of effort much of this fanbase has with players. It's just not true for the vast majority of players & never has been. If you are suggesting he's more physically engaged than other bigger bodies (aka: Kassian, Lucic, Larsson) I'd buy that
155 2018-10-12 23:44:11 And stop subsidizing oil and ignoring the costs of ICE car pollution
156 2018-10-12 23:44:08 We need our own "wall Street" with our own regulations, no more Saudi bullshit oil or OPEC crap

162 2018-10-12 23:43:14 I asked one of my left leaning friends what the people in the oil ‘n gas industry who maybe lose their jobs should do for employment.  Her answer was profound: open a cafe or a b&b!!!!  Wtf?
163 2018-10-12 23:43:11 That all depends on how the "base price" of fuel is calculated. Don't you find it strange that @SasolSA benefits from price changes due to fluctuations in dollar-based oil price when its costs are largely rand-based. Its pure profiteering.

172 2018-10-12 23:42:20 Overall it’s about consolidating wealth. Oil is just one commodity. An important one, but one. Admittedly, I can’t say what the long game is. I’m just one citizen with no influence or special abilities. Sad face

192 2018-10-12 23:40:22 In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil must be dismantled into 34 separate entities. The shares of the individual companies skyrocketed. Rockefeller became the country’s first billionaire with a fortune worth nearly 2 percent of the entire American economy.

203 2018-10-12 23:39:23 @UN Not all Saudis are bad Saudis. Such that to punish a nation for the actions of those who are not rulers is wrong but to not teach them that slavery is wrong it not good. When oil has less value as we move to solar which we need and alternative fuels Saudi will suffer greatly
204 2018-10-12 23:39:20 100% of people don’t like taxes, so I view that 88% as a pretty good number. Hey, when are you going to stop being in love with oil and do things like provide incentives for buying EVs like other forward thinking provinces? Let’s get Saskatchewan off of oil.
205 2018-10-12 23:39:05 Wait so you think the low price of oil is because of pipeline delays? I don’t think you understand economics, man.

230 2018-10-12 23:36:59 Who is buying Saudi oil?
231 2018-10-12 23:36:50 Why are you insisting on keeping Saskatchewan dependant on oil? Why don’t you focus more energy on green solutions. Oil will be a viable resource for maybe another 20 years. Sell it, sure, but endorse self-sufficiency.

260 2018-10-12 23:32:38 literally the only path to victory (and even this path would be extremely difficult) for Hitler was to get that oil. any damage to morale inflicted on the Red Army by the capture of Moscow would have meant nothing without the fuel to get from point A to point B.

266 2018-10-12 23:31:26 CA remember Gov Newsom will need allies in Congress.  We need to get rid of all GOP MOC like @RepMcClintock who support drilling oil offshore and in public lands, deny climate change. In #CA04 vote @Morse4America and send Tom to some red state where he belongs.
267 2018-10-12 23:31:23 There is nothing like clearing up mess, many countries don't ve oil&they are doing just fine, if you don't know you won't know.All our leaders from head to toes failed,so nothing like this trash talk of PDP/APC, lets keep changing government & one day we will get there.

292 2018-10-12 23:29:31 Got a 1998 Honda Accord; 285,000 miles. Still runs great. Hardly uses any oil. Change oil every 5K miles and it will last forever. Will get another Honda.
293 2018-10-12 23:29:26 It is worse listening to Trump talk about the money from the Saudi's he gets. The US doesn't need the Saudis whose people killed us on 9/11 & who tried to put our oil companies out of business.
294 2018-10-12 23:29:12 I'd go Porter, Stout, then Hemp. It may have hemp oil or strong hops , that could compromise your palate.
295 2018-10-12 23:29:11 Don’t know. The old tribal knowledge is that the ‘dirty sock’ smell is caused by dirty/clogged moisture separators. If a senior cappy says that’s what it is and can’t be convinced to divert, not much you can do. I’m told it’s caused by bad seals in APU. Vaporized oil in the air.
296 2018-10-12 23:29:11 I just burned the crap out of my arm with hot oil wooooo

    Behold now, what is so good or so joyous as for brethren to dwell together in unity?
    It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, which runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron, which runneth down to the fringe of his raiment.
303 2018-10-12 23:28:38 Hey @Bin_Hamin my brother is a high ranking official in the government and says 9-11 was an inside job to give our nation a excuse to go to war for oil what is your take?
304 2018-10-12 23:28:30 Service centre mmg mahal sikit. Kalau service setakat tukar engine oil, oil filter, cost barang baru RM 120. Tak susah pun nk buat nya.
305 2018-10-12 23:28:26 Uh..it’s this weird ass oil
306 2018-10-12 23:28:20 Define talented cuz that’s not what I would call that carnival barker. Maybe a snake oil salesman is a better description.
307 2018-10-12 23:28:08 In Alberta, women environmentalists who question the expansion of oil sands production and bitumen exports are threatened with violence and treated as enemies of the people by social media cowards. This is what oil interests have done to democracy. @350
308 2018-10-12 23:28:02 That's because they aren't in the pocket of oil and gas.
309 2018-10-12 23:27:46 No Matter How Much I Oil It, Its Dry Minutes Later
310 2018-10-12 23:27:36 When you’re newly showered and try a new oil for your hair and it just looks like your hair DOES NOT DRY. I think I used too much oil ngl.
311 2018-10-12 23:27:27 This ad is hilarious.  Still voting for Cruz because this hot take has zero to do with my daily life. A $10.00 tax per barrel of oil does. Trillion dollar spending does. Sanctuary cities do.  The right to my own AR-15's does. Tax cuts do. This PAC ad, not so much.
312 2018-10-12 23:27:24 Y’all gotta stop putting lots of oil on your face then taking a picture in the sun

317 2018-10-12 23:26:37 @jkenney's federal govt did little to nothing to help Alberta when the bottom fell out of oil. Now he wants to slash necessary public services to make it worse. And he's willing to use the fringe of society to do it. Smarten up folks.

2. refuse from fish, especially that remaining after expressing oil.
319 2018-10-12 23:26:31 Would nuclear power help mitigate climate change? Why did we stop building nuclear reactors and turn instead to coal and oil fired power plants along with biomass plants? Why do we now buy goods from CO₂ polluting countries like China? Are our energy and trade policies to blame?

333 2018-10-12 23:24:10 When Governments own and run large corporations they are Socialist. Oil is completely state owned in Norway. Dems are trying to kill fossil fuels. The USA is now number 1 in oil, we are no longer dependent on foreign oil. It is because of capitalism we are no longer dependent.
334 2018-10-12 23:24:09 @jewelry those two magpies ruin it for me. The bracelet with the cut out (thdbind said “I love it!). Sure she lives it because there is less silver. Who wants to see skin? They belong selling snake oil. Sorry.
335 2018-10-12 23:24:04 Apparently the US has no problem refining Canadian Oil and selling it back to us. How incapable are we???
336 2018-10-12 23:23:48 Actually  Saudi oil money for American arms. Fracking has  reduced need for foreign oil.
337 2018-10-12 23:23:42 Entonces normal, ay, deja descansar a tus barquitas para recuperar el oil (?)
338 2018-10-12 23:23:41 I’ve also struggled with dry scalp all my life. When I was younger my mom thought it was dandruff. I’ve been using head and shoulders oil control (since seborrheic dermatitis is overactive oil glands) and it’s helped

353 2018-10-12 23:21:19 Your commercial about taxes for gas and oil is disgusting.  I am appalled at people who make light of global warming.  I try not to be angry with differing opinions but this affects my grandkids.  You are wrong to do this.

355 2018-10-12 23:21:01 I've been watching the price of oil for months now and was happy that the govt was making extra money. And then to hear this on the news. Pissed big time. No party can run this government

358 2018-10-12 23:20:50 This is the reality after @JustinTrudeau shut down 2 pipelines and stalled on the 3rd. A national crisis that barely registers in this country--that's how much influence special interest groups have on the oil industry.

360 2018-10-12 23:20:39 That does not sound like a tasty combination, blah.  The best way to eat kale is to make Kale chips.  Spread them out on a pan, cover them with olive oil and salt, then bake them.  Not bad.

371 2018-10-12 23:18:53 I’m baffled by our dependence on foreign oil. The U.S. exports oil as well. Why don’t we just stop exporting and use it ourselves. I don’t follow this close enough, but it just seems like such an easy problem to fix.

387 2018-10-12 23:16:45 I agree, in some ways. If the families were truly close they assisted each other. The family farm, all worked it for the greater good. But they did have the snake oil peddlers to be watchful of. There were also some diseases that the family could not bear, like TB.

Greetings,
My brother has a beautiful new Corolla and we have a service question.

Why are your techs refusing to change the oil after 7 months of city driving?

Do they need training on how to determine oil wear? As a visual inspection should have been performed.

395 2018-10-12 23:15:38 I know China have already looked into it, but there literally isn't a way to turn plastic into clean energy. Plastic is made from oil, gas and coal, only way to get rid of thst is to burn it haha
396 2018-10-12 23:15:29 And oil is been sold 10 dollars right now abi and what about lootered funds,,, let's keep fooling ourselves in this damn country...
397 2018-10-12 23:15:22 I agree Eric. Mostly because I would profit when oil sky rockets to 150 a barrel
398 2018-10-12 23:15:14 Vegans.. when y’all cook for non vegan make seitan, fritters, and a fatty dessert or whatever.. but please drop the no oil no salt low heat cooking or whatever the fuck please for the sake of Goddess
399 2018-10-12 23:15:10 Try abhyanga in the morning to start the day right! On busy days when there isn’t time for a full-body massage try “karnapura”—ear oleation abhyanga that calms Vata. Dab of Sesame Oil on your little finger to gently lubricate your ear canals; reapply as needed throughout the day.

404 2018-10-12 23:14:15 Agreed. Another reason is that we get much less of our oil from the Saudis now than we did back then. I think more people are willing to stand up to them now since that’s the case.
405 2018-10-12 23:14:14 Back in the 70s, oil crisis hit global econ. Most countries responded by protecting their economies at the cost of shrinking global trades & declining welfare. Now we're about to do it again, expecting that the outcomes will be different

414 2018-10-12 23:13:31 You know, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is nothing but a bunch of cavemen who got lucky in the draw of who gets oil. The time has come to tell the billionaires to get fucked and  we're going to depose this shit because it's an evil backwards warlord nation and it needs to die.
415 2018-10-12 23:13:30 Erm, is oil a value?
416 2018-10-12 23:13:25 Until there is oil and the Arabs keep paying their taxes to the west, no one will talk or do anything about the human rights violations in Saudi n the oppression of their ppl by the terrorists regime!!

437 2018-10-12 23:10:20 I agree with you, Sheila. Not attacking. I have to assume that our president understands the economics and will get Congress to work things out. He IS trying to intimidate our allies into lowering oil prices. It's all about the #NewWorldOrder fighting him.

440 2018-10-12 23:10:08 we are not borrowing to pay salaries like your people. People that met 48billion n left 29billion despite oil at above $80 and projects at 20%completion rate. Mad. People. 

We are borrowing to complete and fix project that should have been there 20 years ago. We just start.
441 2018-10-12 23:10:07 why do cars need oil changes and transmission whatever’s and like why do they cost money and why can’t I just fly everywhere
442 2018-10-12 23:10:02 Olive oil, butter, avocado oil
443 2018-10-12 23:09:56 At the expense of what, though? If we’re cutting tax on oil, we should cut an equal amount of subsidies to the oil industry.
444 2018-10-12 23:09:53 My mom has Athena used to eating her food with olive oil  sooo if I forgot she will not touch her food at all.
445 2018-10-12 23:09:46 Oh I use beard oil. Must do. What's killing me is not being able to trim it.

454 2018-10-12 23:08:05 So all the oil companies that are extracting oil in Fort Mac are losing money doing it but keep on investing just because. The main problem is we don’t have enough pipelines to move our oil, the dufus that are against are ok with countless trains and trucks to move it by road.
455 2018-10-12 23:08:00 sledge under a mcd's dumpster's cleaner than alberta's tarsands muck. if we're ok to sell saudis our wheat board & billions worth of weapons then what difference does it make that we buy their more efficiently-extracted oil, we're already contributing to their conflicts anyhow

458 2018-10-12 23:07:35 Everyone knows that pouring oil on a fire only makes the fire bigger.  Apply this metaphor to the current Bayo situation and problem now becomes that most people actually don't know what the oil is suppose to be.  Yet they keep pouring it and are surprised to still se fire.

   That county deserves it for their kids!
461 2018-10-12 23:06:44 Rising oil prices will definitely incentivize operators to keep crude-indexed contracts alive. Big Q’s: how much slack in the market (likely not much due to liquefaction capital costs), what market share does the US take (comp of contract flex) and reg changes (destination cl.)
462 2018-10-12 23:06:21 Saudi oil buried World oil prices and then US shale oil development finished them off. Notley’s been in for one term and you blame her? You’ve had Con Gov’s for 40 yrs in AB plus Harper/Kenney and BCLibCon Govs and you couldn’t get done. If they r all like u I know why! Build it!
463 2018-10-12 23:06:13 FYI, Initiative 1631 does in fact set aside money for water infrastructure projects.  Has Bill Bryant actually read the initiative? Sounds more like he's recycling the oil industry's talking points.
464 2018-10-12 23:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
465 2018-10-12 23:05:56 They're actually theocratic monarchs, but your point still stands. The Saud family has a historically poor human rights record, supported by a rich oil trade. 

It's nice to see someone make a token effort to cut ties with them, even if it will pitter out and die after November.
466 2018-10-12 23:05:52 The performance and gas mileage you get after getting an oil change is like top 5 things that make you happy as an adult.
467 2018-10-12 23:05:39 Canadians should only use domestic produced oil to satisfy it’s energy requirements.
 Globally today,Canadian oil is heavily discounted when compared to WTI,a US produced oil by about $40 dollars a barrel,today’s price is $71.51 for WTI.
C’mon Canada,let’s help our own industry
468 2018-10-12 23:05:29 We can only hope.

483 2018-10-12 23:04:39 I’m curious if you believe in government or media or corporation corruption. Like do bankers and “the elite” lie to us to sell us something?  Do the billionaires want us educated? Or do they want to sell us oil, water and clean air? I think it’s naive to believe they are truthful

554 2018-10-12 22:55:44 Surely oil has helped build civilisation as we know it. It takes humans time to embrace new ways of living.  Btw not sure how we can build and fly aircraft without it. Think about that next time you travel
555 2018-10-12 22:55:43 Eleven percent of the US imported oil comes from Saudi, that said, we should not allow Saudi to murder journalists from the US. If the deal was twice as large, would he trade the panhandle.

567 2018-10-12 22:53:36 Knowing Trudeau, Yupper, yes he would still purchase oil from the Saudi Arabia's, because He's destroyed our right to be a GREAT oil competitor on the World Scene, because He ran on "Destroying Alberta's Oil capabilities" for his fanciful beliefs!!! Shame!!!
568 2018-10-12 22:53:19 Good thing @realDonaldTrump opened up domestic oil production we don't have to have to suck up to the Saudi's anymore right? Thanks @realDonaldTrump ! #MAGA

570 2018-10-12 22:53:11 First and last time I’m having 2 meals from kfc , throat feels like it’s been lubricated by a gallon of oil. 

I miss my home cooked meals from the mother 
571 2018-10-12 22:53:07 But, in a global economy, with Steve Bannon, Trump, Navarro, anti-globalist, white nationalists along with Cheney, Bush and Rex Tillerson, oil industry bastards, you have to recognize the interconnectedness of the world: SoftBank's VisionFund relates to the Paris Accord.
572 2018-10-12 22:53:05 HeLL No, USA Needs Cheap Gulf OiL for Now. A little more tensions will skyline Oil prices.
573 2018-10-12 22:53:00 Congrats! Can’t wait to get my oil blend! Maybe for Christmas?! #melaninmagic
574 2018-10-12 22:52:55 Be nice to see the breakdown include nuclear vs methane vs oil, coal, turf, waste etc... Not all non-renewables are equal.
575 2018-10-12 22:52:50 Dude took $20 off my oil change. God bless him.
576 2018-10-12 22:52:48 Ladies. Is baby oil good for hair?
577 2018-10-12 22:52:44 jus wanna support someone’s son’s dreams and massage coconut oil into their patchy ass beard
578 2018-10-12 22:52:29 It is good that he isn't because we don't want any more Dem sell-outs who take Pharma, Big Oil and War Machine money.  We are tired of bought and sold dems like Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Manchin, Schumer and more.  Hope this is that last term for each of them
579 2018-10-12 22:52:24 well usually micellar water followed by whatever kind of face wash I am using. sometimes i also use dermalogica cleansing oil as well. 
what do you like?
580 2018-10-12 22:52:21 This is pretty stupid, even for you Nikki. The oil companies will raise the price and take up any slack - it's what they do, and you've let them get away with it for 9 years.
581 2018-10-12 22:52:17 Tape it to ring finger and use ice frequently. Use arnica oil and an anti inflammatory. Worst case, for pain...Percocet. Normally no opioids but when I break something I want relief and I trust I know when to say...WHEN. I will gladly help you give conservatives the finger.

584 2018-10-12 22:51:58 have people raised your voice against the atrocities being done in PALESTINE ? 
Are you people blind? can't watch Israili army killing people? 

Today they have killed 7 people and cut their oil supply? Can you people here justify it? @Humanists_UK @UNHumanRights
585 2018-10-12 22:51:57 How can America expect peace in a nation built on genocide & slavery? How many heads of state did America assassinate? How many Civil Wars has America started? How many nations did America invade for oil? #Africa #Asia #Pakistan #Syria #Afghanistan #Iran #Iraq #India #Chile #Peru
586 2018-10-12 22:51:38 Oil the blade, kill a glade. Let it rust, your paper- dust

588 2018-10-12 22:51:11 and because KSA is the main oil producer, Egypt too weak and with more social problems and because Iran has been hostile for 40yrs. it's a TINA problem. If Iran were to stop being a theocracy it will be the best option as partner. #freeIran
589 2018-10-12 22:51:01 Yeah ok sure. Live in your deranged fantasy world. I've wasted enough time on you idiots. Trying to talk sense to a trump supporter is like trying to mix oil and water.
590 2018-10-12 22:50:58 My father’s flight instructor flew in the Pacific theater and had to ditch in the water after taking a lot of air to air and ship based rounds , one taking off his big toe. He said he would’ve made it back if the plane didn’t leak out all it’s oil on the way to the ship.
591 2018-10-12 22:50:57 Glass half full: it helps generate an oil slick/lousy vision for those behind.
592 2018-10-12 22:50:44 looks great. Truffle oil?

595 2018-10-12 22:50:32 So I went to get my oil changed in my car and once they got back they told me I need to rotate my wheels.. 

Like what? They rotate everytime I drive

598 2018-10-12 22:50:09 Tesla is actually trying to solve climate change!

Conservatives hate it. Big Oil hates it. Polluting auto makers hate it.

Now the left hates it?  #NoFriends
599 2018-10-12 22:50:03 Mike: Apparently they shut the turbines off if the wind speeds are too high.
Selina: Is it too late to turn them into oil derricks?  #Veep
600 2018-10-12 22:50:02 Be with people by being against global warming. More hurricanes and surges will hit the South and Midwest. There is just no reason to contribute more toward billions of dollars of destruction and broken lives. Rethink coal. Rethink oil. Solar, wind and renewable energy.
601 2018-10-12 22:50:00 Pastors the anointing on your life is also for the  transitions, disappointments, clueless moments, times where your heart will be broken and wilderness seasons.  Be encouraged my fellow co-laborers, the OIL works in the pit as well as the palace.

#youwhereANOINTED4this
602 2018-10-12 22:49:49 I get why a building owner wants mrkt rent,but our govt subsidizes millionaire farmers and the oil industry, why not subsidize long time small business (5yrs or more?) to exist next to the $10 juice? Its community building and makes sense in every way!
603 2018-10-12 22:49:46 My oil light been on for two weeks smh i gotta change it tomorrow

605 2018-10-12 22:49:43 Chei,  palm oil rice loading
606 2018-10-12 22:49:37 Yes. Canadian oil is bad, bad stuff so we need Saudi oil.

609 2018-10-12 22:49:04 Like I said, ignore the issues, attack the man. It's all you know.

But this one is nuts. What makes you think I explored for oil in the South Pacific? Your hallucinations appear to be worsening.

610 2018-10-12 22:49:04 The oil revenue may have been used in the 1980s to service the results of Arthur Scargill's problems of failure.
611 2018-10-12 22:48:46 Also on #October 10th Trumps Grandma's Birthday,&  The Dow Collapsed didn't it? Russia tried to take out #Nuclear Reactors and Mess up #Oil and #gasSupply Oil Rigs near #GulfCoast Nuclear Reactors/Plants Near Savannah & Jenkinsville,SC,not far from #CharlotteNC

613 2018-10-12 22:48:27 one of the major backers of U.S. tech solutions to climate change: Tesla, Uber, Solar City, Google & Apple (going green with their servers) as well as the impetus for Volvo committing to 100% EVs, part of his Vision2030 plan to get the Saudis off oil.
614 2018-10-12 22:48:23 Trump leading the example for the world. They beat him, tortured him, dismembered him apparently. Ok because we got a billion dollar defense purchase and despots don’t like journalists anyway. Oil rules y’all. And apparently American values have shifted. Sad.
615 2018-10-12 22:47:56 ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS: The lawyer who defended #BP after the #DeepwaterHorizon oil spill is now the top #environmental attorney in the Justice Department. #whycantwestopthis
616 2018-10-12 22:47:48 They sent enough to attack us on 9/11. We only need an excuse to wipe them off the race of the planet. Wtf is oil gonna do for you when we all switching to renewable. Can't even take care of your own people cuz yall got gold lambos. Shaitan worshiping wannabe Dajjals.
617 2018-10-12 22:47:47 Archaeologists have discovered an oil stain that might be more than a thousand years old.

It is Ancient Grease.
618 2018-10-12 22:47:35 Big oil flooded the state with propaganda. I hope 112 still has a chance. #ActOnClimate #Colorado #BigOil #propaganda
619 2018-10-12 22:47:26 I got mine as well, will attempt to cash soon. Careful though, oil has been down recently so it might bounce.
620 2018-10-12 22:47:17 Saudi Arabia has been paying us money and we’ve been looking the other way since it became known 15 of the 19 highjackers who MURDERED 3000+ Americans on 9/11 were Saudis. American lives for tainted Saudi oil money. Screw these guys and that includes Trump.

622 2018-10-12 22:47:04 Chef Kawasaki cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with hot sauce.
623 2018-10-12 22:47:00 Our state is an energy powerhouse – #NorthDakota oil & gas industry set all-time production records in August w/ more than 1.29 million barrels/day of oil & more than 2.43 million cubic feet/day of natural gas.
624 2018-10-12 22:46:51 The school should be closed permanently. Oil wells are a carcinogen.  If there is methane gas there ( there are parts of the city near Playa Vista where there are pockets) then they can explode even without the Metro.
625 2018-10-12 22:46:37 @subaru_usa Service at Camelback and multiple cars in just for oil change told batteries failed test but I came in for bad battery which died while waiting for service and told it didn’t fail test! Strange new battery they wanted full price for took care of starting problem.
626 2018-10-12 22:46:22 @Toyota 

My 2014 Toyota Prius is burning a lot of oil! Brought into dealership who confirmed it was eating oil at a rate of 1/2 quart per 1K miles & declined to repair vehicle under extended warranty because rate of oil loss was acceptable to Toyota standards!
627 2018-10-12 22:46:12 Weeell, it's just going to be another oil embargo of the 70s 
628 2018-10-12 22:46:12 so living next to coal plants/oil refineries has NO cost?? Look at the smog in TO. Health impacts are a cost. Denying is lunacy.
629 2018-10-12 22:46:07 ありがとうございます
630 2018-10-12 22:46:02 Yea shorty called it autozone pussy n i was confused dennabih! Like tf ya pussy smellin like motor oil n WD40 for? From a condom sis? Really?
631 2018-10-12 22:45:51 That's the glass shade on an oil lamp. But still.
632 2018-10-12 22:45:49 Nope. Kennebec potatoes, Ybarra oil, yoky eggs & salt. Na'mas.  Well that's mine!
633 2018-10-12 22:45:47 It is Banu Qainuqaa'.. The agreements written between them & Muslims which they eventually violated was to keep off from killing each other & harboring such, among others. It is just like that of Hudaibiyya supposed to be for some stipulated time. These sulhu are totally diff.
634 2018-10-12 22:45:17 So, it was Saudis who took down the twin towers and now the Saudis who killed a Washington Post journalist. Not Iraqis, not Afghans...Saudis. So when do we make them pay? We don’t need their oil.
635 2018-10-12 22:45:16 wat were you doing there, oil
636 2018-10-12 22:45:15 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
637 2018-10-12 22:45:09 Even so, the blue state is the biggest economic engine in the U.S.

Meanwhile, some of the worst economies are Red States. Alaska - even with all its oil and small population - grows at a snail's pace. Kansas, as already mentioned, is a Republican economic disaster.
638 2018-10-12 22:45:06 The Bush family made their cash from oil

They have bought up a ton of water resources in South America

It will be the future generations wealth

What information do they have as 2 former Presidents, to bet the family fortune on that?


639 2018-10-12 22:45:01 As a country holding a 5th of the entire earth of the oil reservoir, being broke is not in the near future.
640 2018-10-12 22:44:54 I can’t believe how easily we’ve all turned against each other on this 3,5,10 billion dollar project while every week we get robbed of nearly a billion dollars of revenue from oil. This olympics is the drop in the bucket...you want lower taxes, help us get paid for our oil.
641 2018-10-12 22:44:39 3 

By the time Sai Buhari is done with Nigeria, oil revenue won't be enough to service debts
642 2018-10-12 22:44:34 I ordered this raspberry leaf tea and I need to go get some primrose oil
643 2018-10-12 22:44:26 Don't say castor oil. I still have nightmares.
644 2018-10-12 22:44:15 What’s a crying shame is - all the suckers believing the MSM!   They (MSM) are worse than snake oil salesmen!
645 2018-10-12 22:44:12 First and foremost, we need to stop burning ancient carbon. Oil companies have nothing to do with cloud seeding and ice extension. They're experts in drilling and refining, and they can find their own way in the future you and your party need to lead us to.
646 2018-10-12 22:44:05 This link shows us an article sourced heavily from CBN under Buhari, which ends in 2016, before Oil prices rallied to new highs. So it doesn't do justice to what @tonypox put out. Even at that, it's an indictment on all admins from 1999-2016
647 2018-10-12 22:44:03 As a Tesla owner I can tell you don’t bash Musk for being different. The people that were totally in it for the money are the Oil and Gas Industry and their shady little alliance with Detroit.
648 2018-10-12 22:43:57 Yeah, plenty to do with it.  The Liberals have killed how many pipelines now?  Meanwhile our oil is being sold at a discount of around $50 per barrel while eastern Canada buys oil from the US at full price.  We are subsidizing the American economy thanks to you lefty wingnuts.
649 2018-10-12 22:43:45 Everyone is looking for alternatives to oil. Won't be too long before oil isn't used it atleast not much
650 2018-10-12 22:43:43 Akwai aiki nan gaba
651 2018-10-12 22:43:22 To hell with the Saudis.  Technology will render oil useless in 25 years, and, until then, we have more in the US than we can refine.  Trump needs to cut those barbarians off now.
652 2018-10-12 22:43:20 SULHU HUDAIBIYYA you mean? Not in anyway related to this. May be you need to read about hudaibiyya & the detailed explanations by Historians. Read in Albidaya wan nihaya of Ibn Katheer Rahimahullah. Same with that of Banun nadheer & babu Qainuqaa.
653 2018-10-12 22:43:09 EZ shares -0.2% (-4.8% for wk), US shares +1.4% (-4.1% for wk) with bounce from oversold levels led by tech stocks.
US 10 yr yld +1bp to 3.16%.

ASX futures -0.9% (looks a bit odd given rise in US mkt).

655 2018-10-12 22:42:53 Why do we have a general assembly later why can't we just take our midterm exam in peace and go on our own separate ways why why why my social skills are rusty oh well I never bothered to oil it anyway
656 2018-10-12 22:42:52 The Partnership of the USA and Saudi will maybe break up when the USA Punnish Saudi to lower the oil prices
657 2018-10-12 22:42:46 Jerry wake up my god what more has to happen Jason Garrett needs to go, so does Scott Linehan, us as fans r pissed off, go plunge like u did in the oil fields and get Dak some dam receivers to throw too, put ur ego aside and get a real coach, make Kris Richards the coach, 
658 2018-10-12 22:42:36 Bullshit...never going to happen.Noley will reduce Alberta's Carbon Tax to zero and turn off oil pipeline taps to Green ruled BC...
659 2018-10-12 22:42:32 anyways i’m stressed so i covered myself in glitter and essential oil to cope
660 2018-10-12 22:42:31 Fossil fuel will be the back bone of energy for the next 20yrs min REGARDLESS of what direction you/we take. Ya. So let’s sell our oil for 20$ and buy it at 70$ insuring we will be too POOR to advance anything. Ie - Norway +1trillion$.  Canada -1 Trillion $.
661 2018-10-12 22:42:30 @NewshubNationNZ I noticed little mention of alternate provision in discussion about oil It was said we might need new hydro dams to power electric cars  Wouldn't it be more practical to modernise with either solar or wind energy in every new building or subdivision for power
662 2018-10-12 22:42:29 Plus we have lots of oil while we perfect that technology
663 2018-10-12 22:42:20 I can get it in WV, so you should be able to get CBD oil in TX. If not, you can always order online.
664 2018-10-12 22:42:16 Russia? The same country with the biggest oil and gas deposits? Try another poor excuse so we can laugh at your propaganda some more... 
665 2018-10-12 22:42:11 ALL OF MY ARGAN OIL SPILLED IN MY PURSE 
666 2018-10-12 22:42:05 Oil change?
667 2018-10-12 22:41:57 The establishment always shafts the public. Remember north Sea oil  ?  "This will change the way we live for the next 50yrs" .What did they do with the money ? Spent it on magic beans and unicorns.
668 2018-10-12 22:41:56 HONESTLY it's just oil cleansing and cosrx cleanser LOL;; i used to do just cleanser but i think 2-step cleansing really mucks it out esp since it used to feel like the sebum was sitting right on top
669 2018-10-12 22:41:55 お大事にーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
670 2018-10-12 22:41:54 I don’t think anyone should fry scallops with breading EVER, but damn they don’t need to stay in the oil for 56 minutes. That’s how you go from seafood to gum.
671 2018-10-12 22:41:50 That's not why German high command wanted to capture Stalingrad. It was a strategic point that could open up German operations into the Caucauses where the oil is. The USSR wasn't France, they wouldn't surrender if they lost Moscow.
672 2018-10-12 22:41:46 Fellas if she has car troubles, she is definitely single. No “man” is going to let his woman drive around with the engine/oil light on in her car.

677 2018-10-12 22:41:04 Will Saudi Arabia be held accountable or do we need their oil
678 2018-10-12 22:41:04 @cvpayne if you're developing multiple personalities because your thyroid is damaged and you have a metabolism that fails you and causes you to reboot and cope... Don't take the snake oil you bought from the roaming Rainmaker. Start with a dietitian and then a physical medical dr

685 2018-10-12 22:39:46 Saudi Arabia is not our Allies
They were involved in 9/11 and now this it's time our Government stands up to them but they won't too much oil.
686 2018-10-12 22:39:43 Lol.....put engine oil na 
687 2018-10-12 22:39:36 One of my family members has RA and does not take anything other than Tylenol, aspirin, and fish oil. It makes me really sad because her joints are becoming really deformed. I know that I'd probably be dead in a few years without my meds.
688 2018-10-12 22:39:25 1. Yeah I don’t work either and I’d like to keep it that way  I hurt my shoulder hauling oil. I feel like I get news faster on twitter rather than being subjected to all the bs on tv. So yeah I look at it alot too to see what kind of disaster has happened now.
689 2018-10-12 22:39:23 I personally don't consider GDP a sufficient metric.

And in all fairness, Bush 41 inherited Reagan tax cuts. And Bush 43 started an unnecessary war (unusually expensive bc U.S. didn't have as much int'l support, including oil contributions)
690 2018-10-12 22:39:10 InshAllah it will grow fast. Use castor oil.

698 2018-10-12 22:37:45 Well you know, Oil, oil, oil, and oil are the reasons. Just in PA, from the combination of fracking and conventional drilling.

They don't want to have to clean up their mess.
699 2018-10-12 22:37:39 Canadian Oil refined into gasoline/diesel/jet fuel using Canadian Natural Gas in US refineries and BC pays the highest gasoline prices in North America? It makes me wonder how much the US is paying for the Natural Gas.
700 2018-10-12 22:37:28 Lol better yet- why don’t you look into Adam’s donors? I’m willing to wager some benefactors or oil industry and weaponry sales
701 2018-10-12 22:37:27 Yup lived it, they are closer every year, stop oil use pretty easy

705 2018-10-12 22:37:08 Is there any reason other than oil that we are allies with Saudi Arabia?  If that well was dry, we would have put them in North Korea type isolation a long time ago.
706 2018-10-12 22:37:08 Some of us have dumped olive oil all over ourselves and the floor and triggered an automatic bath, which Mama accidentally set to adult-hot rather than child-hot because she was frantically running around trying to stop us....

709 2018-10-12 22:36:20 So stop the relentless negativism and put forward plans and ideas to help. Remember your government under Harper had a decade to advance access to Canadian oil. Never mind we should be actively looking to wean ourselves and the world off fossil fuels.

724 2018-10-12 22:35:00 The only way Liberal Ottawa will hear the voice of Alberta is to turn off the oil taps! For Real! See how quick that stops Plastic Barbie’s dream vacation and brings Trudeau back begging for Alberta to reconsider!
725 2018-10-12 22:34:49 It's definitely a shame. Should we start drilling more on American soil and in the oceans while building more pipelines for American energy independence? It's unfortunate but I'm pretty sure the world still runs on oil and we can't have it both ways.

Prices are very persuasive.
726 2018-10-12 22:34:46 A share in the profits that Saudi’s will reap from invading Yemen.
Oil, land, hookah pipes. 
727 2018-10-12 22:34:15 The fish will run out before the oil.
728 2018-10-12 22:33:46 Alternative point of view: We all enable and enrich the Saudi regime by creating demand for oil. Refusing to do the show won't change that. The regime will be $40 million poorer after this show, however.
729 2018-10-12 22:33:44 You realize the government, nor Trudeau has nothing to do with “selling the oil”. It’s sold on an open market. Oil sands oil is sold at such a discounted rate because there’s no access to it. Which in part, is the PC’s fault.

736 2018-10-12 22:32:45 How about regardless of what happened we drill for our own oil... it’s right under our feet 
737 2018-10-12 22:32:35 @UN It is amazing how easily led all of you are by greedy countries, greedy corporations, OPEC because Venezuela owned it's own oil they were called communist and sanctioned.

752 2018-10-12 22:30:43 Why the opposition? 

Suppose they’re actually wrong about climate change, but we acted as if they aren’t. What do we get out of it? Better infrastructure, cleaner air/water, less to no reliance on foreign oil, cheaper utility bills...

Why are conservatives so opposed to this?

761 2018-10-12 22:29:53 I wasn't linking big oil and trickle down - I was presenting them as two different issues. No, it is not fact. It is propaganda pushed by top earners and pocketed politicians to justify tax cuts for big business. History shows us that tax rates = little impact on economic growth.

772 2018-10-12 22:29:06 Yes, I picked up, when I read Jo’s blog, she mentioned oil being below the ocean floor. That is impossible. She quoted a reference, I looked it up, did not say what Jo said. Tried to find the blog again later—she must have deleted it after protest from the geologists cited by Jo.

790 2018-10-12 22:25:13 Good, but does not address the increased heavy metals pollution from coal burning or increased risk of oil spills for opening drilling in pristine waters.

Nor will there be any regulation to encourage packaging changes to reduce plastic. Cleaning is good reducing is better.

Oil industry struggles due low wcs price doesn't make it very profitable, carbon levy not really a factor #abpoli
819 2018-10-12 22:20:58 My favorite is the kitchen in which they felt the need to add pans hanging, mixer, and decorative olive oil but leave in the out of place light and what looks like a security camera above the cooktop cabinets.
820 2018-10-12 22:20:53 The UK is not in OPEC, never has been and never will be as it became a net importer of oil products a decade ago. OPEC's members are mainly Gulf states, with Nigeria, Angola and Venezuela too.

837 2018-10-12 22:18:16 We need more Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas. Geoengineering is a priority.
838 2018-10-12 22:18:13 At one time the majority thought the earth was flat.  It stands to reason oil will be depleted in the future and the problem will fix itself.

840 2018-10-12 22:17:56 Question:  Why in the hell would the oil industry want to help the transition to a low-carbon future?  What is Forbes smoking?
841 2018-10-12 22:17:54 They don't want the soil just the oil that's beneath that
842 2018-10-12 22:17:53 Tell me again how your family bankrupted the Keil Oil Company? I heard it's a good story of incompetence..

845 2018-10-12 22:17:26 They would much rather give credit to a con artist snake oil sexual pervert than give ANY credit to a refined,  educated, classy black president!
846 2018-10-12 22:17:24 Very tasty !
847 2018-10-12 22:17:23 Bloody oil money is ruining football 
848 2018-10-12 22:17:21 Last thing they need is a falling oil price.
849 2018-10-12 22:17:20 I had a dull headache every day this week & today I tried putting a dab of peppermint essential oil on the bridge of my nose. I actually think that may have helped b/c the ibuprofen has disappointed all week. plus, now I smell minty! 
850 2018-10-12 22:17:14 I’d say stupid. He thinks his tweet will clear Kushner if any implication of involvement. He is throwing oil on fire (no pun intended)

854 2018-10-12 22:17:01 Ai dole ne nake gaya maka.
855 2018-10-12 22:16:54 With all due respect to John Manley, if Canada could export its oil internationally, we would have a detrimental effect to Saudi Arabia. We could displace a significant amount of oil from these dictators to our allies with an effective ethical oil campaign.
856 2018-10-12 22:16:50 I’m supposed to know what clean oil looks like?
857 2018-10-12 22:16:50 We closed the ozone hole. Cleaned up the air in NYC by switching from oil heat to natural gas (thank you fracking!) Ditto converting coal plants to nat. gas, reduced acid rain and carbon output. Globally it's harder, but we can science our way out of this one, too.
858 2018-10-12 22:16:39 Oil changes are way to stressful
859 2018-10-12 22:16:34 Let me read the end of this book for everyone.  Some unpopular bloke in the Saudi intelligence service will admit to going rogue and ordering the hit.  The Saudis will behead some unlucky functionaries and offer a tepid apology. Oil barrels will continue to flow.

860 2018-10-12 22:16:21 A second tranche of US sanctions on Iran’s oil and gas sector are set to go into effect on November 4. This second round is likely to have a bigger impact on Iran’s coffers, with insurers reportedly already stopping covering shipments.  #JamalKhashoggi #DeepState
861 2018-10-12 22:16:19 You guys are acting like trump is the first president to have any kind of dealings with Saudi Arabia. What about oil for the last 40 years
862 2018-10-12 22:16:19 oil and gas lobby saw to that, hopefully ITER can be finished
863 2018-10-12 22:16:10 Mushrooms with underground mushroom oil

865 2018-10-12 22:16:06 @PlantBaeJu oh she helped the kid out with some fish oil info 
866 2018-10-12 22:16:02 We were poor.  Our glue was a mixture of flour and water.  When done what was left over we took to the kitchen. There we maybe made some more, poured it into a skillet of hot oil and called it flapjacks. With syrup, or fig or pear preserves they were so good.
867 2018-10-12 22:16:02 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
868 2018-10-12 22:15:55 Need to reinstate those oil/gas exploration licences then
869 2018-10-12 22:15:55 Then you can’t have oil by it or on it like baby my scalp is already dry lmao I spent $200 to get my hair done & I fcked it up quick lmao
870 2018-10-12 22:15:48 Did you do it by incentivizing the oil companies to do the right thing?
871 2018-10-12 22:15:46 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /

874 2018-10-12 22:15:26 *maybe* he hadn't actually looked at the others and he was there to meet a demon. Doesn't explain how they took him down so easily when he used to just blast a whole roomful. They should have at least holy oil firebombed him or something to explain that.
875 2018-10-12 22:15:24 I've been boycotting them for around four years now. Galaxy became my substitute, I don't want to hear bad things about Mars Corp...  Although Lidl sell a choc bar for 30odd pence and its just as good if not better and fair trade! From memory palm oil free too.
876 2018-10-12 22:15:22 Any idea what "Syria is poised to take the pet terrorists' oil fields" is supposed to mean?
877 2018-10-12 22:15:21 Why do they only make extra virgin olive oil where’s the obscenely slutty olive oil
878 2018-10-12 22:15:09 The squid is not only the fastest thing under the water but a voracious hunter.... also very tasty
879 2018-10-12 22:15:07 "This place is really weird" said the pasty guy wearing skinny pants and a blue beret while stinking of patchouli oil at the town diner today.

881 2018-10-12 22:14:53 got to get my oil changed
882 2018-10-12 22:14:28 Mix cooked lentils with a tremendous amount of garlic, add salt, pepper, a bit of sugar, some marjoram and blend it. Add rice flour (I didn't have any so used bread crumbs), plop onto a lined pan, roast, flip, roast, brush with olive oil and serve on a bun. It's soooo good.
883 2018-10-12 22:14:21 What do you call tax cuts for the rich? Rich Socialism! Why is everyone hung up on that word? Subsidizing oil companies, farmers, air lines, etc...Corporate Welfare(Corporate Socialism) There is no difference other than what you have been MISLED to believe!
884 2018-10-12 22:14:20 Happy Weekend, GO BREWERS!
885 2018-10-12 22:14:19 I suggest you check the timing. Norway got lucky with the oil price v production timeline.

887 2018-10-12 22:14:18 @JulieXxxKay I bet you smell like kush weed and coconut oil frfr 
888 2018-10-12 22:14:16 The random encounter in #azurlane feels like shit. 
When ammo and especially oil are so tightly constrained, losing the evasion roll for ambushes just feels like punishment rather than an element meant to spice things up.
889 2018-10-12 22:14:14 I am actually sweating in bed right now, after a real hot sunny day. Cleaning my winter garden front windows was perfect today. Over all, saving a lot of Diesel / OIL energy these times ;-) Love it then!
890 2018-10-12 22:14:03 @sadytaheer happy birthday Sady, more oil to your glow 
891 2018-10-12 22:13:55 I'll give #PresidentTrump credit for at least not pretending like every past  #President that we're ever gonna lift a finger against #SaudiArabia the  world's top oil exporter.

892 2018-10-12 22:13:52 Sure, the Saudis are committing a genocide and have caused a humanitarian crisis with 22.2 million people, including the worst cholera outbreak ever, but they got that sweet sweet oil!

894 2018-10-12 22:13:36 There is an endless list of purchases we can feel guilty for. Eating meat, driving a car, gasoline, buying electronics that contain rare earths (slavery, unsafe working conditions), eating foods containing palm oil (slavery and deforestation), etc.

Watching Disney is pretty low.
895 2018-10-12 22:13:27 My eyelashes are not as luscious as they used to be I need to go back to the castor oil ting
896 2018-10-12 22:13:21 The only place I get my oil changes from is the oil can. They a black owned business and I love coming to them. Every car I had I came here for my oil changed
897 2018-10-12 22:12:43 Wait! .. So with all the billions phone companies are making in Nigeria there’s not one phone factory in the country. 
-62 years after oil was discovered we  still can’t survive without importing petrol. 
-In 2018, bore-hole & roads are still campaign promises. WE NORMAL SO? 
898 2018-10-12 22:12:43 We all can be as outraged as we want, but we need Saudi oil. Our country literally can't function without it.

900 2018-10-12 22:12:40 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: burning crust with sweet coconut oil and Italian sausage.
901 2018-10-12 22:12:40 Casually sniffing eucalyptus oil and having chest pains... random illness surprise attack on the weekend 
902 2018-10-12 22:12:32 Ignore my last question! I didn't see this follow up Tweet. From your report, it does sound like you would benefit from some Exalted Mars conditioning. I'd go with the spray or the oil and try it out on Tuesdays to start. Both of those will last a long time, too. 2 sprays is all.
903 2018-10-12 22:12:24 Castor oil babe
904 2018-10-12 22:12:17 Declining oil prices, a likely decrease in demand for oil in a greening world, and global warming, sounds like #karma is likely to hit @saudiarabia  like a brick.  #TYTLive
905 2018-10-12 22:12:14 I admire all your work. Obviously I think oil companies have done tremendous damage. It’s why I don’t take a dime from them and have called for no new fossil fuel projects. I just want to explore how we best get to the clean energy future we all want and tackle climate change
906 2018-10-12 22:12:08 @nkilvert Why don't you develop a scenario for Sydney's hot West. Badgerys Creek airport closed because planes can't take off. Frequent power outages as power plants can't cope and transformers overheat, long petrol lines at filling stations as oil wars rage around the world
907 2018-10-12 22:12:04 How was school today?

I googled “oil field dispatcher salary” on my school computer.
So, like that.
908 2018-10-12 22:11:59 Why should I read that? How much oil did you find in the South Pacific? Got skunked, eh?
909 2018-10-12 22:11:56 Kai lukuku 
910 2018-10-12 22:11:55 And to keep the oil price high so they can fight sanctions
911 2018-10-12 22:11:54 oil & water
912 2018-10-12 22:11:54 Also, the original Tweet says nothing about this transition, which is probably why it's being trashed.

In energy politics, geoengineering & cloud seeding are common Trojan horses thrown about by Big Oil to avoid transition. So it's not a great place to start the conversation.
913 2018-10-12 22:11:51 @aphriainc sales increase included approx 100 kgs of dried cannabis and cannabis oil supplied to third party partners conducting clinical drug trials.

914 2018-10-12 22:11:46 @SadeABC I ain't worried about the Hungarian and Turkish. Arab got all that oil.
915 2018-10-12 22:11:45 I cut out the nuts and added more fish oil

Otherwise, my diet was quite stellar
916 2018-10-12 22:11:40 Sis don’t shave , Wallahi it’s not neccessary just deffo get professional to trim the damage, and every week use hot oil treatment using hot olive oil

918 2018-10-12 22:11:30 imagine if taking care of our planet was profitable.. we'd have solved it within a year then. but no, coal, oil and meat is still where the money is at. what's even more disgusting is that the people in charge of this knows all of this but dont care cause they'll die soon enough
919 2018-10-12 22:11:24 We just got some new *8.5 Blue Bird Cage oil rig*
920 2018-10-12 22:11:20 The Mars powder is more oriented to people who want to do Mars magic (as an added component in spell work) than remediation. For remediation, I'd go for the oil or spray since they're easier to apply. Do you have issues with motivation, drive, and competition? (over or under)?
921 2018-10-12 22:11:15 I know of 2 instances where high fat intake diets with certain oil supplements were the ONLY solution to childhood seizure disorders that were not responsive to contemporary medicine. BELIEVE IT OR NOT - I've seen it work 2 times in VERY VERY dire circumstances. All my best

926 2018-10-12 22:10:57 The sight of minseok's hair pains Mr physically; today after I showered I applied a coconut oil mask on my own hair just in his honour
927 2018-10-12 22:10:57 Have you ever tried using tea tree oil? I’m pretty fortunate when it comes to skin so I can’t personally attest, but I have a lot of friends who swear by tea tree oil for acne! Just thought I’d pass on the tip :)
928 2018-10-12 22:10:39 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
929 2018-10-12 22:10:36 U really should reflect on the point he ( @oil_shaeikh )made ma'am.  
Our views may differ n if you ever are certain your veiw would not change , speak your truths without shutting out others.
930 2018-10-12 22:10:35 If he just wanted to get rich, there would be far easier methods than fighting the oil companies, automakers, and military contractors.
931 2018-10-12 22:10:21 This isn't I-732. Sorry your initiative lost. I voted for it, despite its flaws. You have a choice: you can either dither over I-1631, or you can support it. But you can't do both when the other side is spending $20 million of Big Oil money misleading voters.
932 2018-10-12 22:10:20 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
933 2018-10-12 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this October? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
934 2018-10-12 22:10:07 So even if we get pipelines built and can responsibly produce oil, would you rather leave it in the  ground?
935 2018-10-12 22:10:04 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
936 2018-10-12 22:10:02 The high cost of oil on the world market is prompting industrialists to explore the possibility of advanced extraction techniques.
937 2018-10-12 22:10:00 It's a lie because that is USA and not global peak. The conventional crude oil production did peak in the 1970's.  Fracked oil from shale is not conventional crude oil.  It was extracted because the conventional crude oil peak was reality!
938 2018-10-12 22:10:00 What are you talking about?!?! You really don’t understand how this works do you? Oil companies do not lose or benefit from gas taxes.
939 2018-10-12 22:09:58 Oil change completed
940 2018-10-12 22:09:56 I wish people can understand
941 2018-10-12 22:09:56 @CarlyMusleh I wrote a letter to Sainsbury’s asking them to remove products containing palm oil 18 months ago as I could not believe that every biscuit/ cake/ chocolate even tins of custard who needs palm oil in custard? Or anything else ? Was in all the ranges they stocked

947 2018-10-12 22:09:35 I see it now. $SPY is the S&P500 and has oil, guns, etc. $DSI is Domini Social Index 400 and closer to your goals. $ETHO could be a fit, and eco focused. We have evaluated all 100-ish #ESG #ETFs and can help investors do more good, so let us know what you need
948 2018-10-12 22:09:24 Not a good thing DD.  Fracking, oil spills and underground pipes running all through America.
949 2018-10-12 22:08:58 The oil fields, gas fields and pipelines (Levant)are all tied into #ObamaSpygate and Uranium One.
950 2018-10-12 22:08:45 It wasn’t an email. It was on here. It’s ok no worries. It was about CBD oil.
951 2018-10-12 22:08:38 Oooo shit , what oil is it . I need parts !!
952 2018-10-12 22:08:37 I'd move all the Christians over here and deport all the Muslims to over there.  Oil and water don't mix.
953 2018-10-12 22:08:32 Absolutely agree. Shifting subsidies is great place to start; U.S. spends $20 billion of public money on fossil fuel production/year. Would be great to remove it & shift to renewables.

Shifting frame from "incentivize oil companies" to "standing up to Big Oil" would help a lot.
954 2018-10-12 22:08:08 So you are happy with status quo until every drop of profit can be squeezed from existing oil reserves. Would you be happy with that answer if you were Syrian or Iraqi or Iranian or Yemeni?
955 2018-10-12 22:08:00 CBD oil... why did noone tell me?
956 2018-10-12 22:07:55 as I expected, “limited mental abilities”.

Try to read more than repeating what others told you to say.

Saudi oil reserves sufficient for a 170 years

That time maybe you will be in an oil barrel
957 2018-10-12 22:07:44 Spirit of the Forest: Human....I speak for the trees.....my form is as old as the tallest oak and my conscious even longer

Spirit: STOP WITH ALL THE FUCKING OIL YOU DIPSHITS IM DYING
958 2018-10-12 22:07:41 You need massage on the neck with shea butter oil.
959 2018-10-12 22:07:30 I have nothing to do with big oil.  I just think I-1631 is terribly flawed and that it will be totally ineffective helping us deal with climate change. It is regressive. Too partisan, and has no effective spending plan for billions of dollars.  Very bad.
960 2018-10-12 22:07:15 And remember dinosaurs were here and then turned to oil, balance of them didn't work, so then came other animals, apes, ones we evolved from, due to the need of a more intelligent species, and considering the probability of peace exists because we can say it, it will no doubt.

962 2018-10-12 22:06:43 This chart shows how the world ran out of LPs and had to transition to CDs.  Same thing happened with Commodore64s and Apple IIs.  Media tells us oil is next. 
963 2018-10-12 22:06:29 Wouldn’t higher oil prices help US oil shale producers?
964 2018-10-12 22:06:20 anyway I should probably start using marula oil and buffet
965 2018-10-12 22:06:18 Some Old people do care about Climate Change but there are people who have been mislead (lied to) by politicians for years who had a political interest (greedy Big oil special interests) and studies funded by them to confuse this issue- not a good thing - even when they see it
966 2018-10-12 22:06:14 Felt so cocky wearing factor 15 tanning oil for the last few days and only burning a bit

971 2018-10-12 22:05:57 Why everytime I go for oil change there's new people. I am like tired of getting to know the front desk then it's new people.
972 2018-10-12 22:05:50 @NoahJ456 @MrTLexify @MrRoflWaffles @MrDalekJD On Blood of the Dead there is a cypher next to the oil can on the docks.
973 2018-10-12 22:05:40 What's the present oil price now. Lol... it's presently higher than what it use to be during GEJ. Meanwhile, who borrowed to pay salaries again??
974 2018-10-12 22:05:33 If I was the Norwegian prime minister I'd give you full use of our oil fund to do whatever it takes to get rid of fossil fuels.

977 2018-10-12 22:04:54 @msnbc Had aspot about American cheese? The reason people are giving up cuz its not real. Kraft singles are mostly oil and water. It doesn’t have enough natural bacteria to be good. Like milk. All eat diet food thickened with gluten then wonder why intolerant? Overdose! On both!
978 2018-10-12 22:04:52 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
979 2018-10-12 22:04:40 I know! Ya think? Livestock are more important  and the ranchers, oil and mining interests want it ALL...the #'s say it all...
980 2018-10-12 22:04:26 I didn’t think it was trudeau who sold the oil, I feel stupid for thinking in a capitalist society the private companies sold their products. I guess we live in a communist country where the govt sells the products for the companies....
981 2018-10-12 22:04:12 Nobody cares what @algore has to say about anything.

His "settled science" statement was a lie. His sale of Current for $ derived from Oil was hypocritical and disqualifying on this subject

@JudyWoodruff THIS^^^ is how you add value & balance as a journalist. Try it some time.
982 2018-10-12 22:04:10 No its ass because it looks like an oil refinery.
983 2018-10-12 22:04:09 It’s true, to do them properly you need to use lard, or maybe beef dripping, but oil will do at a pinch.
984 2018-10-12 22:04:05 When you go in for an oil change and they reset your oil life but also fuck up all your other settings 
985 2018-10-12 22:04:04 Working w/ students w/ specific needs: I know L needs a new set of oil pastels every time.   A needs a Ticonderoga with a spiky eraser from my top desk drawer and a quiet space.  M needs headphones and notebook.  D is good as long as I'm a goof.  Cool.  Lets rock this art room.
986 2018-10-12 22:03:59 .@CNRLCareers, we know the truth about your decaying oil and gas wells. When will you create jobs in clean up and reclamation instead of mining and drilling? #abpoli #CleanItUp #polluterpays
987 2018-10-12 22:03:59 Anyone else see the Irony of the FairIsle getting electricity for a full 24 hrs for first timewhen it’s situated in the oil rich North Sea? #FairIsle #northsea #northseaoil #ToriesOut

990 2018-10-12 22:03:16 In that case, I’ll be right over with my massage oil!
991 2018-10-12 22:03:08 #ff @ShepherdKathryn for SCOTUS knowledge, historical accuracy, and wit. She sure knows a lot about old dead dudes/oil-on-canvas! Thank you, Kat!

994 2018-10-12 22:02:57 My faith is worth much more than gold or silver, £ or € or $, crude oil or precious metals or stones.
995 2018-10-12 22:02:56 @UN If anyone should be sanctioned it is Saudi who has participated at the highest levels in human trafficking, kidnap, abduction of free women and funding of terrorism not allowed to sell openly on all markets any oil. They have too much money with too many human rights abuses
996 2018-10-12 22:02:51 Damn, Jason, you make a great argument for leaving the oil in the ground and moving Canada’s focus toward industries that aren’t causing humanity’s extinction from #ClimateChange
997 2018-10-12 22:02:33 How fake he is. We still sell them arms, we still by their oil,because he HATES Alberta .
998 2018-10-12 22:02:25 Cbd oil. 
999 2018-10-12 22:02:22 Another reason why Trudeau could act, replace oil with our own regulated brand, another swing and miss, thru his press conf, as you know, I'm not the most liberal on Twitter, this is a easy win, especially for someone who claims to be so in favor of human rights
1000 2018-10-12 22:02:13 You’re not very good with google.  There’s nothing in that article that suggests any spike in crime is linked to immigration.  On the contrary, it suggests that it could be related to a drop in the price of oil.
1001 2018-10-12 22:02:12 All u sing is corruption. We won't be deceived. Show us policies put in place, what has been done apart from the looting of oil subsidy, Unregistered oil lifters etc
1002 2018-10-12 22:02:04 @UN The Saudis whom allow women to be abducted into Saudi do not allow anyone to take them back out have no laws for allowing the return of abducted women should not be allowed to determine if Israel can sell their oil they are drilling  make up lies they are terrorists to stop
1003 2018-10-12 22:01:56 Jesus,  that's right up there with the people who say they don't need oil because they ride the bus.
1004 2018-10-12 22:01:53 Henry Ford made an electric car that was faster than his own ice car...proof that it is big oil greed that will kill our planet...period
1005 2018-10-12 22:01:42 To clarify: We need lots more clean energy, some of which will be owned by corporations (though ideally a lot by communities).

But why would we need/want to transition oil companies to renewables companies? We need more renewables, not to coddle the richest industry in history.
1006 2018-10-12 22:01:42 It’s that thing called oil....
1007 2018-10-12 22:01:35 In using acrylics now,as much as I love oil working at home it just gets too complicated with turps solvents etc but not happy with how fast they dry :-\

1011 2018-10-12 22:00:48 I think the car may have started using CBD oil I'm using.
1012 2018-10-12 22:00:47 MY CBD oil BUSINESS drops this month 
1013 2018-10-12 22:00:43 Our role in the world is so clearly screwed, our own military recruitment ads admit that parents will think their kids are suicidally crazy to sign up to go defend an oil rig for Putin. "Support their decision." Jesusing Christ.
1014 2018-10-12 22:00:42 Can someone be creative or brave enough to capture more of the revenue stream from our oil and gas or mining sector?
Tax cuts are usually a backdoor for abuse and almost never pay for themselves lets hear more talk on wage growth and real support for Australian industry .

1016 2018-10-12 22:00:32 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil
1017 2018-10-12 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
1018 2018-10-12 22:00:28 Totally agree - the minute I see Palm oil in a list of ingredients, it goes straight back on the shelves. I'm not bringing that rubbish home..
1019 2018-10-12 22:00:24 2/2 why we sold arms to our enemies. Boy, did he tap dance about economics and so forth. An Israeli college student later thanked me for my question. We can’t get off of oil and on to renewables quickly enough!
1020 2018-10-12 22:00:13 @UN He represented OPEC which is said to be Middle East Exporting countries for oil but I believe it is the Wold Bank (Fictitious Business Name) who had just begun drilling for oil. We do not need Saudis who allow human trafficking to sell us oil as long as we do not let Global

1024 2018-10-12 21:59:37 Why do the guys at the oil change place always make me feel so uncomfortable?? Lol
1025 2018-10-12 21:59:35 Added more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs since the election. Manufacturing employment is growing at its fastest pace in more than two decades. 100,000 new jobs supporting the production & transport of oil & natural gas.
1026 2018-10-12 21:59:34 Use engine oil
1027 2018-10-12 21:59:21 I agree with your tweets. Said them myself. Saudi is a swing producer and can move the global economy. Oil is their nuclear weapon. This is realpolitik.
1028 2018-10-12 21:59:20 @ChickfilA wassup w ya chicken?? New formula? Or cooking in different oil?? Whatever y’all did UNDO IT
1029 2018-10-12 21:59:18 Getting my oil changed // messing around with Georgia this shit be ridiculous
1030 2018-10-12 21:59:09 Ashley, I rotisserie Dems and GOP both.  Dems on Wall St and the military industrial machine that sucks our nation dry of blood and money...Caving to oil lobbyists..etc
On issue of voter suppression it really runs in one direction EXCEPT on the issue of gerrymandering as noted
1031 2018-10-12 21:58:35 Hey @realScottWagner we’ve sent you a candidate questionnaire through @UwchlanSafetyCo could you please reply so we can inform our neighbors of your position on topics related to oil and gas? Thanks!
1032 2018-10-12 21:58:09 Who keeps oil in the fridge
1033 2018-10-12 21:58:07 beard oil AND lube?   

the PERFECT product...
1034 2018-10-12 21:58:00 As I’ve said previously at the time as a soldier you aren’t concerned about right or wrong just coming home. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and Iraq never had WMD Burt was about 2 oil platforms in the Northern Arabian Gulf. But remembrance is not about the rights of war  1/2
1035 2018-10-12 21:57:56 Days of our lives,  another world and general hospital.  Then also that one that took place in Oklahoma with the oil tycoons.  Now I can’t remember what it was called but Reva and Josh were in it.
1036 2018-10-12 21:57:55 Well given I work with some of those experts, I’m curious as to who you’re talking to. Renewables are where most people are looking to now in the industry. Now is the time to be divesting from gas, coal, and oil.
1037 2018-10-12 21:57:45 It makes you wonder though...Canadian Oil refined into gasoline/diesel/jet fuel using Canadian Natural Gas in US refineries and we pay the highest gasoline prices in North America?
1038 2018-10-12 21:57:45 If it’s a blockage warm some olive oil in the microwave till it’s lukewarm or if it’s just water lay on the side it’s blocked all night
1039 2018-10-12 21:57:43 update, I came for an oil change & tire rotation but they wouldn’t rotate them bc I need new ones, it’s a good thing I got paid today bc holy moly tires are expensive
1040 2018-10-12 21:57:43 Facebook, Twitter and Google are begging for the Standard Oil treatment.
Bigly.
1041 2018-10-12 21:57:27 Sick. Bringing this stuff to our Western Culture is like oil and water. Does not mix.
1042 2018-10-12 21:57:19 The house of Saud was put in place by a post WW1 British government looking to cling onto power in the Middle East and retain influence abroad, but due to oil, the tail started wagging the dog.  Now the dog needs to dock that tail.  #SaudiKillsJamalKhashoggi #Yemen

1051 2018-10-12 21:56:47 I called on Jerry Brown to stop all new oil permitting in the state
1052 2018-10-12 21:56:42 Have you tried it with some olive oil . Girl broccoli is good 
1053 2018-10-12 21:56:38 Pag nilalagyan ko talaga castor oil kilay ko palage nangangati
1054 2018-10-12 21:56:31 Nobody has right to take nations right for self determination. Times of feudal primitive rule should be well over or I don't believe in progress. I'm tired of talking about unity in climate change in the World where secretly people STILL TODAY r killed for OIL! God forgive us all
1055 2018-10-12 21:56:22 You do understand, simpleton, that the PM doesn’t sell oil, do you ?
1056 2018-10-12 21:56:08 Water, aloe vera gel, a little bit of avocado oil and essential jasmine oil. You can add coconut oil but I don't get on well with it so I left that out 
1057 2018-10-12 21:55:59 With #oilprice back on the rise, will oil majors once again divest from renewables? #timewilltell
1058 2018-10-12 21:55:56 you can always continue to use plastic and oil ... who knows if it will do good for the earth! leather is long lasting and evasive waste. ;)
1059 2018-10-12 21:55:51 Yes Diane,  the oil sands is important to the USA.  Obama wanted to shut it out, and as such was not that much of a friend to Canada as he was to Trudeau. Canada remains a safe source of oil to the USA, however it is important that we develop foreign markets and our energy east.

1063 2018-10-12 21:55:32 CBD oil, like any other supplement or treatment varies from person to person. My book has much more information in it if you’re able to get it.
1064 2018-10-12 21:55:29 Do something that hurts them in the pocketbook. Quit buying millions of dollars of their oil. Why can’t we discuss the important things that might make a difference?
1065 2018-10-12 21:55:24 Dark room water to drink and essential lavender oil
1066 2018-10-12 21:55:11 Low level of servicing ratios  that predates 2015 was as a result of high oil prices. Substitute oil prices at that same time to todays price then you will know that revenue drop is  responsible. Thats why we need to diversify and increase our tax base.
1067 2018-10-12 21:55:02 #Atikulated had the luxury of oil price averaging $68 for most part of his govt.@MBuhari 's govt  oil price average is  $40.
1068 2018-10-12 21:54:46 the best way to allow new sources of energy to gain momentum is to stop subsidizing standard energy like oil and allow competition to take place. The government makes the barriers of entry hard for new players with alternative energy ideas.
1069 2018-10-12 21:54:44 I sell organic oil for skin/ hair care nd black soap made from natural ingredients suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices.pls RT nd patronise thanks.

1071 2018-10-12 21:54:36 Extra virgin olive oil
1072 2018-10-12 21:54:28 Agree that oil companies have done tremendous damage. But we need to incentivize transition to energy efficiency and renewables
1073 2018-10-12 21:54:27 I should prolly get an oil change one of these days
1074 2018-10-12 21:54:25 Btw I agree 100% with the pollution problem - thing is, nothing is being done about it. And yet you would jeopardize the future of the next three generations all because you don’t want to change for something less dependent on oil and coal.
1075 2018-10-12 21:54:14 who do a oil change for the low?
1076 2018-10-12 21:54:06 Of course the EPA would disband the panel of air quality experts. Without their advice, there will be no restrictions on pollutants. The T. administration--bought and paid for by your local coal/oil/auto/ . . . industries.
1077 2018-10-12 21:54:00 I’ve never had an oil change longer than 30 min tf kinda oil they got 
1078 2018-10-12 21:53:55 We are doing a listicle on “things that help us relax,” @shanpalus is working on oil diffusers, we’re coming out with a sunlight alarm clock guide, and currently doing mattress testing, but I’ll pop this in slack! (These might already be pubbed but I’m on vacay)
1079 2018-10-12 21:53:25 I think it's funny when guys flex their cars that their mom takes to get the oil changed or for any maintenance it needs. Guys can be 21 and  not have one lick of responsibility, and they think they are badass because they have a loud ass car that their mommy takes care of. NOPE
1080 2018-10-12 21:53:24 Hmm. 9-5 is back together with a cleaned sump/pickup/valve cover, lots of new gaskets etc, new oil+filter, and that "new" turbo... 

Something's wrong though. There's a strange sound from the engine while on throttle, and there's no boost pressure at all.. Crap.
1081 2018-10-12 21:53:23 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
1082 2018-10-12 21:53:18 I’ve tried some palmer’s lotion with coconut oil but never just plain! I’ll have to get some!! Thank you so much
1083 2018-10-12 21:53:16 Very nice. Can we find this product in overseas ? Olive oil is in high demand in Arab Countries... will the govt. facilitate for its export ?
1084 2018-10-12 21:53:16 Funded by Ali, straight from the oil sales of ISIS. 
1085 2018-10-12 21:53:14 I wonder if Andy will remain mum for fear of offending his oily and  Saudi fiends who may stop India from buying a Canadian oil which they otherwise be OK  to refine if it's from Iran and with the money they will continue 2 bomb Yemen with arms purchased through Trump Jared  Co.
1086 2018-10-12 21:53:09 The Republican answer to the oil spill was to apologize to BP, a foreign oil company.
1087 2018-10-12 21:53:04 They want to keep the oil price high
1088 2018-10-12 21:52:57 After the Biafra war (a senseless retaliation battle based on oil and secession) about two million Nigerians were dead and titled collateral damage shortly after this Nysc was made to bring Nigerian youths together (we have universities to do that this is just a waste of a year)
1089 2018-10-12 21:52:41 Watching fresh varnish being applied to an oil painting is literally watching porn I swear
1090 2018-10-12 21:52:36 Yes!!! My scarring is up my calf and I always get told about the “wonders” of bio oil and various other crap to get rid of it. I hate the assumption that I want rid.
1091 2018-10-12 21:52:35 @JedediahBila   'Back then'...glue had peppermint oil...so it had both a peppermint smell & taste.  Kids ate it all the time which is why they stopped adding 'favorable' additives.
1092 2018-10-12 21:52:32 Agree it should be NSF and other research. But we need oil companies to transform and enter renewable energy, energy efficiency and spaces that are solving climate change.
1093 2018-10-12 21:52:31 In that case, are we going to drill and refine more oil here?  A lot of your constituents here in CA need those jobs!

@GaryBenoit63
1094 2018-10-12 21:52:19 @BetoORourke Florida here. Please ask Cruz, & residents of Gulf,  if they believe in Global Warming.
Forget oil & gas industry.
Don't be politically correct.
It's hot enough in Texas.
Get rid of Cruz.
No stone un turned!

1096 2018-10-12 21:52:11 Ted Cruz was bought by the oil companies and the NRA @BetoORourke receives his money from regular tax paying constituents that haven’t ever seen Ted do anything but kiss other Republicans arses do we want #BetoForTexas
1097 2018-10-12 21:52:10 Ladies and gents castor oil for your eyebrows works magic frrrr I swear I’m getting a unibrow and I’ve been using it for just two weeks
1098 2018-10-12 21:52:03 no, it's a international and domestic private racket of kleptocrats that want to make absolutely sure the oil machine keeps on chugging, what do UK US, Russia, Israel and Saudi/Qatar all have in common... huge oil/gas sectors and lobbying groups.
1099 2018-10-12 21:51:55 Toh aii ba ta da lafiya aii... we've known this long time now.  They're having panick attacks, losing their minds cz their god is going down down down to the abyss.
1100 2018-10-12 21:51:53 I’ve worked out in the oil patch between the mtns and pecos. We had some gorgeous views every morning.
1101 2018-10-12 21:51:53 World’s largest exporter of fuel oil that is burned by ships. This is basically the sludgy stuff left after refining crude that the oil companies can’t make use of. High sulphur content and terrible for the environment.
1102 2018-10-12 21:51:52 Try clove oil if you haven’t already, tastes like arse but numbs it for a lil bit x
1103 2018-10-12 21:51:52 It would be bad if we swapped the big sell of “Big Oil” for “Big Cell”... I mean “Big Battery”... “Big Lithium”?
“Big Watt”?
I give up.
1104 2018-10-12 21:51:48 
1105 2018-10-12 21:51:46 dude i always surprise myself when i’m struggling financially like i put olive oil in my dry ass damn near empty SAMPLE mascara tube two weeks ago and my lashes still flourishing
1106 2018-10-12 21:51:38 That's why the story says, "One of the lowest-hanging fruits by far would be reducing methane from oil and gas operations," right?
1107 2018-10-12 21:51:35 1. Brown flour in oil over med' heat
2. Stir in celery, onion, and bell peppers. Simmer.
3. Add boiling broth
4. Add pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt.
5. Add vegetables and / or meat. Simmer.
6. Serve over rice.
1108 2018-10-12 21:51:27 Please check those projects. Date initiated and % completion as at handover date. After 4 years, having almost all the projects below 50% is terrible. A lot of them were below 20%. What were they doing with the oil money?
1109 2018-10-12 21:51:24 Does Bio Oil really remove scars?
1110 2018-10-12 21:51:20 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1111 2018-10-12 21:51:06 no one wants to destroy anything just stay out of these places there is absolutely no reason for us to ever be the  ME except oil
1112 2018-10-12 21:50:55 could be because of our "shared values" with Saudi Arabia - oil sales
1113 2018-10-12 21:50:54 The dinosaurs in government want you to buy their fore fathers ooze.... oil & gas....

bitch i just put oil and vinegar on a sandwich and you're getting a tuna sandwich with the bread scraped out the middle like its a fucking pig in a blanket FOH
1117 2018-10-12 21:50:05 No... don't get excited...he was looking for his olbas oil nose fix 
1118 2018-10-12 21:50:03 It's not his religion being mocked. It's his hypocrisy. If he practiced what he preached, he would gain respect. As it is, people can see right through the snake oil act. Who are these 'elite' they keep banging on about? Definition please.
1119 2018-10-12 21:49:52 I saw you today getting your oil changed or getting your car inspected lmao
1120 2018-10-12 21:49:44 i wonder what cologne drake wears. i bet it smells excellent. i just know he smells like shea butter, beard oil and virility.
1121 2018-10-12 21:49:42 Oh so now it’s Scotland’s oil industry? Shoulda told Westminster that decades ago eh.
1122 2018-10-12 21:49:39 Nigeria hasnt ever really worked... as a new economy with oil Nigeria grew into a richer nation and with the oilboom it created wealth for many associated with government and the government.
Our first Election ever recorded about 2000 people dead due to violence during election
1123 2018-10-12 21:49:37 I only eat Italian-style tuna in olive oil! I won’t touch the water-packed stuff! You should try the Italian tuna..you’ll never go back

1125 2018-10-12 21:49:28 Every political grifter has made their way to Saudi Arabia since Aramco secured the House of Saul.  
Their money has bought protection in the highest of places.Their money and oil has held the world hostage for years and with greedy and amoral Trump, they will rule with impunity
1126 2018-10-12 21:49:27 i made eggs once and when they didn’t turn out right asked my dad why and he told me it was because . I Forgot To Add Oil To The Pan
1127 2018-10-12 21:49:26 Now we just need to convince people that these pipelines could be repurposed to move cannabis oil in the future....
1128 2018-10-12 21:49:22 Oh no please. I'll have to use engine oil as body lotion
1129 2018-10-12 21:49:18 I mean we know white flour is bad, but whole grain pasta? There are some folks in the Mediterranean that eat quite a bit of pasta and some of them live into their 100s. Tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil seem to be a pretty good combo also, and a high plant based diet.
1130 2018-10-12 21:49:17 Took my car in for it's first oil change two days ago.  Today it shudders, won't accelerate properly, and has 2 engine error messages.  First guy said schedule a check up, second d girl went over his head to the big boss.  It's being looked at now.
1131 2018-10-12 21:49:16 Desperate, because they see themselves losing grip of the populace. Oil money is dwindling money getting scarcer. All the subsidies that gov give to people are slowly coming to an end.
1132 2018-10-12 21:49:12 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1133 2018-10-12 21:49:07 He would have been Hitler's ally so they could take over Russia to get the oil.

1134 2018-10-12 21:49:06 Hope it would work to prevent, but not clear how.  Economic fraud has always been in the food supply (I remember receiving "organic" mint oil fr China that had CCl4 (huh!). Organic programs need to do more to regulate/enforce. People lie
1135 2018-10-12 21:49:05 Cannabis Oil
1136 2018-10-12 21:48:46 What does PR mean in relation to weight lifting?? Do you do contests where you oil your whole body up??
1137 2018-10-12 21:48:43 Let's see - got Starbucks to use fair trade coffee, got KitKat to stop using palm oil, and caused all sorts of problems for Monsanto in the EU, Russia and Latin America, so I'd say that it was quite potent.
1138 2018-10-12 21:48:43 Your pics for the oil sands advisory board tell a different story.

Partying with Tides in Washington is also a giveaway 

The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
1139 2018-10-12 21:48:34 So he shouldnt do what Obama did? Bush? Kennedy? Clinton? He shouldnt do what every other country out there does? He shouldnt put our country first? Funny that every other President over looked these issues when buying oil from them.
1140 2018-10-12 21:48:10 my grandpa just picked up a bottle of extra virgin olive oil and looked me dead in the eyes and said “does this mean the olives never had sex?” my grandma laughed so hard the water she was drinking came out of her nose
1141 2018-10-12 21:47:55 Very good partners in providing the US oil while we help them commit atrocities in Yemen
1142 2018-10-12 21:47:52 The #Hippies were right! The #GlobalIndustrialComplex with its use of chemicals, oil and coal, will destroy the earths natural echo systems and cause rampant extinction.
1143 2018-10-12 21:47:52 1. I actually meant Spar Adeola Odeku. 
2. If you like Indomie mixed with palm oil and pepper then chilli and some small rubber chunks of sausage and chicken. Seyi, it is not worth it. 
3. I still have the chicken cos I bought fish and Chicken flavour.

1144 2018-10-12 21:47:49 This is all hilarious to right wingers. If right wingers controlled evething for 20 years, they'd destroy everything. No clean water act, clean air act, endangered species act. Jus oil and coal. In a few more weeks, we will witness the GOP losing the house & state governorships
1145 2018-10-12 21:47:46 as during the war ,the petrol supply from the gulf countries was cut off from the rest of the world on the pretext to help the arab states while in fact ,that was a dirty game to increase the oil prices plus the desire to sell the oil of the gulf of alaska and mexico
1146 2018-10-12 21:47:37 The Lagos state task force don't care about your type of bike, they arrest and seize whatever is on 2 wheels, secondly why are your riders using highway ? Ain't it prohibited case study Lagos/ Abeokuta express road

1148 2018-10-12 21:47:09 Money (oil) talks.
1149 2018-10-12 21:47:06 Same here re: tuna—I was just exploring.

I use EVOO, coconut oil, butter & ghee, but really, not that much of any of them. Most of my fat comes from whole foods too. Oh, and a bit of the avocado oil mayo occasionally. That stuff is awesome.
1150 2018-10-12 21:47:02 Waye malami?
1151 2018-10-12 21:46:30 My jojoba oil came today , I can’t wait to use it and see results
1152 2018-10-12 21:46:27 Are you claiming oil is a burden and doesn't financially benefit countries when managed correctly?

1166 2018-10-12 21:44:39 Who knows how to change oil ??
1167 2018-10-12 21:44:36 Sir Ian “there’s no oil” Wood “you look at all that oil?” guy?
1168 2018-10-12 21:44:32 When oil production exceeds the demand for oil the price goes down. Substitute any commodity for 'oil' and the same thing is true.
1169 2018-10-12 21:44:22 Um, how about more using of alternative sources of energy, put more regulations on businesses for pollution (and actually enforce them), reduce emissions in cars (electric being best and lowers our dependency on oil), help repopluate rainforests...just a few of many examples.
1170 2018-10-12 21:44:21 Ok jesse at express oil change deserves more recognition. i go by there at least every week or 2 for him to reassure me that i don’t have a flat tire and STILL continues to give me free air. bless you dear.

1177 2018-10-12 21:43:33 The sooner their fucking oil runs dry the better.
1178 2018-10-12 21:43:20 If only Alberta had invested some money from their fat years into education and training for jobs other killing the planet.  Who are they going to blame when it runs dry or the rest of the world moves away from oil and it ain’t paying the bills anymore?

1190 2018-10-12 21:42:18 I don’t get it. Yesterday I spent 0 dollars... and today I got an oil change, filled my gas tank, bought a new outfit, new jewelry, and went to the liquor store...
1191 2018-10-12 21:42:10 Start looking at real estate, like say an abandoned oil rig in intl waters? Ya'know, for reasons.
1192 2018-10-12 21:42:09 You don’t mix water and oil
1193 2018-10-12 21:42:01 But they buy 10b in US arms and trade oil in dollars...

1199 2018-10-12 21:41:42 I think market cap for a digital asset with “real  use case” is like saying what’s the market cap of all the worlds oil rigs or oil tankers that move around the worlds energy.

1201 2018-10-12 21:41:22 the people of TX have been conditioned to accept that without oil they will have nothing. well they have oil & still have nothing. I had the greatest education in TX, graduated in 74. it is shocking to see how poorly the their  system is now. they have learned to expect nothing.
1202 2018-10-12 21:41:10 CBD oil maybe

1213 2018-10-12 21:39:28 Considering the deal was if they only take dollars for oil, we will sell them military equipment. If we break relations, most likely, the dollar will crash. Other country's won't need to hold petro dollars as reserve currency. The only thing we could do is invade and take over.
1214 2018-10-12 21:39:28 Its almost like he’s like someone you talk to in real life on the street or in a store. Not perfectly rounded, unrehearsed, a little rough around the edges, almost like a human. Not a snake oil salesmen for the DNC or the GOP for that matter
1215 2018-10-12 21:39:26 Running out?  Atlantic west of Shetland, Firth of Clyde once the Trident subs move to some other unfortunate part of the K, in fact the whole Atlantic margin, and yes, even the new recent discoveries in the North Sea, you do need to keep up with the news about oil.
1216 2018-10-12 21:39:23 Socialism is going to save the planet? Fucking hell. How many times does that have to be tried before people give up on the fact it will never work. It certianly won’t reduce reliance on oil.

1227 2018-10-12 21:38:13 As we see a President directly say “we allow Saudis crimes because they spend Billions here”, worth noting that 09/11 was carried out by the likely heir to the majority of Saudi oil wealth... it’s called “Binladin” oil, and it’s the same one.

1249 2018-10-12 21:35:49 They are just roasted potatoes.Boil in water with 1/2tsp bicarbonate soda for 5min then season,toss with oil& bake! Super crispy outside creamy inside!
1250 2018-10-12 21:35:38 @kasie Sea level rising due to burning of fossil fuels. I believe the subsidence is due to oil extraction...double whammy from fossil fuel extraction and consumption.
1251 2018-10-12 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this October? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1252 2018-10-12 21:35:05 Castor oil works miracles on the lashes
1253 2018-10-12 21:34:18 Burned my hand with cooking oil over 4 hours ago and it still stings 
1254 2018-10-12 21:34:16 @TheLastLeg is it ok for fracking protesters to be locked up by a judge with family connections to oil / gas industry? #isitok
1255 2018-10-12 21:34:11 So how much did PDP saved for Nigeria to benefit after the drop in crude oil price?
1256 2018-10-12 21:34:08 Change your oil
1257 2018-10-12 21:34:07 Bio oil is fucking bon, krijgt ge zelfs striemen mee weg
1258 2018-10-12 21:34:03 We have only been carrying Zilis CBD Oil for a short time, but the testimonies we hear from our guests are amazing! It's now available in cream form for spot treatment.
1259 2018-10-12 21:33:40 I said I was gonna keep these braids in until December. . That’s a negative! My hair already growing out and I only had them in for a week. . That wild growth oil makes your hair grow out very fast. These braids will be in until the end of this month.
1260 2018-10-12 21:33:40 I like to think i’m responsible and then I realize i’m 2 months past due on an oil change 
1261 2018-10-12 21:33:31 Geologist, Teacher, Oil driller, Lumberjack.
1262 2018-10-12 21:33:05 Star!!!

1263 2018-10-12 21:33:01 If u get some peppermint oil and dab some on your wrists and temples it's like SUPER energizing. Wakes me up better than coffee ever has + all natural and no anxiety 
1264 2018-10-12 21:32:42 Loads of oil money,absolutely no class as usual,still bitter blues
1265 2018-10-12 21:32:39 It will be CBD oil but will be interesting to see what they prescribe it for, to be honest I would rather have CBD than all the pharmaceuticals, I have had some nasty side affects to drugs over the last 14 years, Worrying part is Big Pharma will want to take over producing it
1266 2018-10-12 21:32:32 I suspect, even among the wealthy, he’s a bit of an odd-man-out. 

My guess is he doesn’t have much clout, and has to be really careful not to step on too many toes. Oil companies are already threatened by him as it is, and they have far more sway (for now.)
1267 2018-10-12 21:32:32 Coconut  oil got me looking healthy lol 
1268 2018-10-12 21:32:22 Argan oil dan Macadamia oil serum.
1269 2018-10-12 21:32:00 Ur kidding, right? Cruz: Oil and gas money. Pacs. Redistricting. TX would be blue if there was u1 man/1 vote and no fear of ICE depressing the legal vote.
1270 2018-10-12 21:31:53 Oil painting. — feeling frustrated
1271 2018-10-12 21:31:52 in uk they use sunflower oil sometimes olive oil. I've noticed in america they use a lot of soybean oil wonder why?
1272 2018-10-12 21:31:50 Stifle a laugh? Wrong answer, ask for forgiveness cause that is just terrible to do to someone you love?? 
1273 2018-10-12 21:31:47 oil supply is not limited by how much oil there is in the ground but by how high the price is in relation to the marginal cost. if you cut supply, price will go up and other incentives align. Your suggestion is climate-change wack-a-mole
1274 2018-10-12 21:31:42 S/O Omar at pepboys for checking my oil cause i’m low as hell and i’m useless for car knowledge of any kind 
1275 2018-10-12 21:31:15 It all depends on how you see it. That's your problem not mine. I have already said it.
1276 2018-10-12 21:31:14 some of y’all carts dam near look like they got engine oil in em
1277 2018-10-12 21:31:07 I dropped car off this morning at 8:00 to get an oil change and new brakes... it’s 5:30 and the guy “still working on it” 
1278 2018-10-12 21:31:04 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
1279 2018-10-12 21:30:58 People will go there just to see these. They will bring tourism dollars. If they're all dead, nobody's gonna go to Borneo. Nobody is gonna wanna go stay on a palm oil plantation and eat kit kats.
1280 2018-10-12 21:30:39 Almost halfway through the discovery period, fall crop insurance prices are well below (spring) guarantees: corn $3.66 ($3.96); soybeans $8.62 ($10.16); sorghum $3.54 ($3.83); oil sunflowers $0.157 ($0.75).
1281 2018-10-12 21:30:36 Justin Trudeau 
West Texas intermediate is trading at 72$ today our Canadian oil (Western Canadian Select) is selling for $18 dollars a barrel! Why the 53$ difference? US buys our oil at pennies and sell it to the world for top dollar. Our leadership (Justin) has failed us.
1282 2018-10-12 21:30:35 Hey everyone! This ad is brought to you by a GIANT OIL LOBBY! So be sure to do the opposite of whatever they’re asking of you. In this case vote YES.

1285 2018-10-12 21:30:20 Quick review of Atlanta brewpub.

Kölsch? Brilliant! 

Margherita pizza? As if canned tomato sauce and bottle of oil had been poured on a baked crust. 

Go for the beer.  #GAbeer
1286 2018-10-12 21:30:18 It sounds like though, with the rupture and explosion of the natural gas pipeline and the immediate increase in gasoline prices, that we’re also selling the US and the US refineries, natural gas to process oil into gasoline/ diesel/ jet fuel. What’s the whole deal worth?
1287 2018-10-12 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1288 2018-10-12 21:30:11 Then let's fire on
1289 2018-10-12 21:30:03 Hehehehehehehe... I don't Nid to show him or anybody my face. After all you put your pix on your Avi for inspection which I don't nid
1290 2018-10-12 21:29:59 Canada had legalised marijuana & in the UK doctors are now allowed to prescribe cannabis oil. Matter of time...
1291 2018-10-12 21:29:56 @petenajarian I think URI is a steal at $139.  I am long options and they report after the market closes Wednesday.  EPS estimates of $4.62.  Company thrives off of commercial construction and oil drilling and exploration.  52 week high $191.
1292 2018-10-12 21:29:54 You should do more research on this Ro. Not only is incentivizing oil companies probably the wrong way to go (it assumes we want them to continue being oil companies), but geoengineering is a VERY delicate science that has dangerous implications if done wrong.
1293 2018-10-12 21:29:53 Supporting these kings for dirty oil money it terrorizing the Middle East
1294 2018-10-12 21:29:52 It would’ve been another 500 ontop of that if I hadn’t already done my air filters, cabin filters, oil, etc
1295 2018-10-12 21:29:51 Every time I go to get my oil changed they always show me that little stick thingy and I have to pretend I know what they are talking about. I’m like yea that looks good 
1296 2018-10-12 21:29:50 Thanks for the retweet’s Matty  it wasn’t the biggest job but quite demanding,it took an artic full of block in the steps and walls and the ground was horrible,it was on a demolished train station the ground was still contaminated with oil and diesel 
1297 2018-10-12 21:29:48 Hahaha. I feel compelled to point out that you should only use lemon oil on dark fretboards.. Rosewood or ebony... Stay away from the light.... But seriously, where does all that shit come from?
1298 2018-10-12 21:29:38 Turf got hot, hella heads got shot on dead body soil/
Po po's on that ass like hot baby oil...
1299 2018-10-12 21:29:27 How is Trudeau selling this oil? It is the Alberta oil industry and market forces which are beloved of Conservatives.
1300 2018-10-12 21:29:23 GEJ initiated 122 projects but completed just 9 during oil boom. 

PMB is here cleaning your mess in drought! Completing projects. Never again! PDP, Never again. You guys should be ashamed.
1301 2018-10-12 21:29:20 just give me my oil block back .
1302 2018-10-12 21:29:07 This Osita guy scored an own goal with those docs he posted.Why will a project initiated in 2012 be having 10% completion as at 2015?You find it hard to see any of those projects above 50% completion even after 4 years despite the oil boom. It’s really crazy.
1303 2018-10-12 21:29:06 this was @SaintZayn getting his oil change on the tl earlier
1304 2018-10-12 21:28:59 Nope. Trump and the Military Industrial Complex wants to bomb Syria in order to steal oil amongst other demonic objectives. 
1305 2018-10-12 21:28:30 There a few wimin there at Leith Hill but land owner withdrew permission. Other areas in south continue to operate. Wych Farm Purbecks been providing oil for 40 years.
1306 2018-10-12 21:28:24 Hehehehehehehe. Faceless or not my business and my choice. You are already in the gutter I don't need to drag you twice @__yellows have already done it. Let me take pity on you.
1307 2018-10-12 21:28:13 Hafsy come on show em your face
1308 2018-10-12 21:28:04 As in! Just slice onions inside as u dey warm am, e don fresh be that.
1309 2018-10-12 21:27:56 You are out of line with that. Republicans support cutting regulations that have destroyed the oil industry and tradesmen. Wow, we are the largest oil producer now making us free from foreign control and needless wars of the past. We want LESS government. Come on man 
1310 2018-10-12 21:27:53 #PikBotha was a mastermind a true diplomat and proof #Sanction don’t work . Sold #arms to #Iran and #lraq so they could war against each other   And #RSA had the cheapest oil on the Planet. No wonder he kept smiling. RIP Pik. He probably knows a back door to #Heaven

1316 2018-10-12 21:27:31 Need to find 5w40 oil, mom's car is running low, the ones that were open didn't had it.
1317 2018-10-12 21:27:18 Another reason the Russians like chaos in the Middle East is the fact they’re all economically competitors with their major export and said chaos leads to higher oil prices
1318 2018-10-12 21:27:11 I'd sell snake oil. Damn Internet makes it too hard to do now, only the religious sheep fall for it.
1319 2018-10-12 21:27:04 The type of oil that comes from Alberta oil is expensive to refine. That and the fact that we no party can find a way to build pipelines around the protesters and court cases, seems like a product that should probably be left where it is at this time instead of increasing output.
1320 2018-10-12 21:27:03 Can’t thank these guys enough for the job they have done for me with my vehicles. I’ve had Christian and his crew handle everything from full classic rebuilds to changing the oil!  Great service, terrific knowledge base and trustworthy. Folks like that need to be bragged on!
1321 2018-10-12 21:26:59 Congrats to @AtlasGrowers on their cultivation AND oil production licence!!! so proud and glad to be part of the process from START to the END with the client!! #amazing CCI#
1322 2018-10-12 21:26:58 Googled how to help an ear infection at home cos first one ever and long story short I’m sat here with cotton wool soaked in olive oil in my ear
1323 2018-10-12 21:26:57 Jason doesn't care about the oil companies. His dream is to make Alberta a paradise for Amway salesmen.
1324 2018-10-12 21:26:44 @tesla can't lobby a state to allow for direct sales; Senator from [Big Oil Country] doesn't give a f*ck. Tesla is dragging an entire industry kicking and screaming into the electric era. Does it suck that we'll have to pay another few thousand $$$? Yes. Am I mad at Tesla? No.
1325 2018-10-12 21:26:44 The USA has no business being in Syria. Get out of Syria NOW. And by the way there is not embassy for the USA in Syria. I am sick and tired of the USA bombing Syria all in the name of stealing oil. Also sick and tired of its hypocrisy. You support head chopping terrorists. 
1326 2018-10-12 21:26:38 JFC. Almost every oil at the store is synthetic. I want that dino blood, yo.

1330 2018-10-12 21:26:17 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
1331 2018-10-12 21:26:17 You need lavender oil . It will clear away in seconds
1332 2018-10-12 21:25:50 Absolutely with Ted Cruz I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
1333 2018-10-12 21:25:48 One example: there is currently no growth in US gasoline demand. But there is strong growth in jet fuel, and also distillate. So US oil demand still growing, but, already affected by transport sector efficiency investment. EV impacts in US haven't landed yet, but are coming.
1334 2018-10-12 21:25:39 Getting my baby a oil change and tires checked 
1335 2018-10-12 21:25:29 the oil gets more oil – we know exactly what percentages of that come down to civilians and even if that, we’re seeing unprecedented waste from forced urbanization. no slave would continue extracting metal for her own chains once freed of a driver’s whip and gun.
1336 2018-10-12 21:25:24 PZ Cussons and Unilever Nigeria require 5000 tons of palm oil, while okomu and presco oil produce just 800 tons... hence the need to import palm oil from malaysia temporarily for 1 year.
1337 2018-10-12 21:25:20 This girl outside changing her own oil and her man is just watching. Lmfao GUHHHHHHHHHkakspxlssmsmmssn
1338 2018-10-12 21:25:10 I guess you didn't have the thyme to put regular oil on.
1339 2018-10-12 21:25:03 Anyone expecting gas prices to stay low is a moron. Oil demand is up therefore gas prices will rise. It’s not rocket science.
1340 2018-10-12 21:24:44 "A quarrelsome #wife is like a constantly leaking roof on a rainy day. Whoever can restrain #her can restrain the wind, And can grip oil with his right hand."

1342 2018-10-12 21:24:10 When she gets her oil changes on time >>>
1343 2018-10-12 21:24:02 Building Energy East doesn’t also magically build billions of dollars worth of cokers at Canada’s privately owned and run east coast refineries. This is a super dumb ethical oil/conservative talking point.

1345 2018-10-12 21:23:44 Guy take it easy.. I mean it as a compliment no hard feelings. Nd my boyfriend he is too manly you can't handle it.
1346 2018-10-12 21:23:33 A roadblock is that the segment in the market is smaller than fossil fuels and gas/oil. The lobbyists pull a lot of money.
1347 2018-10-12 21:23:20 You ever have your slipper break in public? I’ve had it happen twice. First in between classes in college and then second just right now waiting for my oil to get changed.
1348 2018-10-12 21:23:18 And remind them that they had Nigeria at a platter of gold when oil price was at it’s peak...
1349 2018-10-12 21:23:04 We buy oil from them. They buy weapons from us. That’s the only thing we ‘share’ with the vile Saudi regime.
1350 2018-10-12 21:22:46 Psh, nice slap on the wrist.  I bet you got castor oil at bedtime, rather than a shot of hydrochloric acid too, huh?

1355 2018-10-12 21:22:18 Do you think government policy said we needed to increase Natural gas usage? The market brought us fracking, the market is is gas at a cheaper price than oil and coal.
1356 2018-10-12 21:22:15 Put up your pic bishhh and your boyfriends pic so we know where you belong. You can't be faceless and come for me, come out of the sideline how are we sure you're not a catfish?

1358 2018-10-12 21:21:56 Wow tea tree oil changed my life
1359 2018-10-12 21:21:52 I wonder what we'd fight wars over if Oil weren't a thing.
1360 2018-10-12 21:21:50 pharmaxtracts sold out of all CBD oil?? What other site do you recommend?
1361 2018-10-12 21:21:49 Largest in the world. Oil, coal, road-based vehicles, space based vehicles.

1364 2018-10-12 21:21:38 How often should you get your oil changed?
1365 2018-10-12 21:21:36 We can’t use crude oil, it gets shipped to China to be refined and then back to us. Canadian oil is the worst kind of fucking oil. Have you seen what the oil sands look like?
1366 2018-10-12 21:21:26 Pres Trump hesitate to take action with Saudi Arabia as he is looking at US interest.  Working with Saudi to keep oil prices down & also the Israel/Palestine peace deal.  Let's see outcome of investigation.

1368 2018-10-12 21:20:52 This week need some tea tree oil
1369 2018-10-12 21:20:49 The point is at its core, we must get off oil ASAP. It is literally destroying the planet for my grandchildren and everybody else. We have 12 years left. The rest of the world has nothing but contempt for those who profit from or defend the burning of fossil fuels.
1370 2018-10-12 21:20:18 You know what I’m gonna start teaching myself car stuff like doing an oil change or changing tires bc fuck paying $50-$100
1371 2018-10-12 21:20:07 if you just want to buy anything for the sake of it, I recommend the marula oil
1372 2018-10-12 21:20:02 How about dropping #27 down for a look and putting JP up!?!?! That’ll let him stretch his legs and plus oil need speed on the second line and lucic doesn’t bring that
1373 2018-10-12 21:19:54 How does it get its hydrogen ?? Pipeline perhaps , there isn’t any special magic fairy dust that supplies it with that particular gas . How is it compressed ?? All things involved need a supply of oil . Wow ...... how fucking dumb are you !!
1374 2018-10-12 21:19:54 NOTHING NEW HERE.   HELL, MOST OF THE 911 HIJACKERS WERE SAUDI.  BUSH EVEN HELPED SAUDI FAMILY MEMBERS GET OUT OF THE TYE US AFTER THE ATTACKS.  OIL IS THICKER THAN PATRIOTISM.

1376 2018-10-12 21:19:20 They don’t even have enough $ to feed their people or keep their oil industry going. Therefore the award is meaningless unless Russoro is able to enforce it
1377 2018-10-12 21:19:12 Any idea where I can get the oil et al?
1378 2018-10-12 21:19:11 Sooo #BinSalman has #WaPo journalist killed & dismembered in #Saudi consulate; and Canada  STILL gladly buys their Blood #Oil instead of using our OWN  All of YOUR establishment leaders are just as much into the #Snuff Porn as the #Saudis are. #PPC2019 #BernierNation
1379 2018-10-12 21:19:04 I'm using CBD oil started just a few weeks ago and it's doing wonders for me...arthritis, psoriasis, nightmares, sleep....I think it's lowered inflammation a lot. I was hobbling around for a year & bones popping & crackling. I can wear shoes that hurt my feet a couple months ago
1380 2018-10-12 21:19:01 Innalillahi
1381 2018-10-12 21:19:00 Years ago it was said the price had to be 100 per barrel for it to make sense at all.  It's not oil, let's remember.  It's tar.  Very expensive.

1387 2018-10-12 21:18:43 Kehlani looks like she smells like a more expensive version of Lick Me All Over body oil from the beauty supply store, idk why it’s still a thing to joke about her having body odor. Yall gotta get fresh material
1388 2018-10-12 21:18:40 Advantix is a topical oil. It has permethrin in it, so it also repels biting flies (especially if applied directly to ears). Bio-Spot is similar.
1389 2018-10-12 21:18:34 Refried beans usually involve lard (or vegetable oil). I'm not sure of the spices that are most traditional, but I'm pretty sure at the most basic level it's just beans and salt and fat. Maybe a little onion.
1390 2018-10-12 21:18:20 praise like oil 
for you I pour it out

1392 2018-10-12 21:18:14 Jakande tenure was the most buoyant period of oil wealth that Nigeria has ever experienced & will ever experience as a country

2.4 million barrels a day, no pipeline vandalizing with less than 80 million population

No wonder they were eating full chicken & cornflakes in unilag
1393 2018-10-12 21:18:12 Canada doesn’t have the money anymore. We keep helping everyone else.  Where’s the money to come from?  Justin doesn’t want to sell Canada’s oil and gas.  Taxpayers don’t their money used for this.  Help Canada first!
1394 2018-10-12 21:18:02 You should leave the category open for as long as others are left open,else you're just manipulating to fuel your ego, we know you're not impartial, you're a misfit to conduct this, you aren't credible.
1395 2018-10-12 21:18:02 Do not change the historical true.  UK and France wanted ( because of interests of the oil industry ? ) the war against Libya and asked USA for help.
1396 2018-10-12 21:17:52 Well, as I have mentioned, even koch industries is starting to see that they are going to lose profit if they keep investing in oil for cars. People will not pay for gas if it goes above 4 bucks a gallon. We’ve seen it.
1397 2018-10-12 21:17:33 My boss says , we get oil changes on all our cars once a month. When you’re ready for your next one I’ll send it out with ours 
1398 2018-10-12 21:17:17 Agreed — if it weren’t for oil the US govt would care as much about the Gulf states as it does about the Central African Republic. And the technology already is available to eliminate 90% of the demand for hydrocarbon fuels.
1399 2018-10-12 21:17:00 1 Car been in the shop for a whole month and avout 2 weeks cause I was goin back and forth wit the warranty company about oil change documents that they asked for and I provided, walking and Lyftin' it to work when I had the money, mind u I work at 3am when there are no buses
1400 2018-10-12 21:16:48 I think she died.
1401 2018-10-12 21:16:43 Kind of a toss-up, they're both coming at us pretty fast, but I'm calculating co2 stuff right now, so: global catastrophe due to co2 & the stupid oil people lying as they sprayed air w/imho coolant to hide co2 warming earth *fast* & it kabooms in our face. Soon.

Hold my beer.
1402 2018-10-12 21:16:30 Oh yes! Another increase at the pumps!! Bastards! No love for the oil execs!
1403 2018-10-12 21:16:23 If you haven’t tried cbd oil you should probably try it for a month straight. Thank me later :-)
1404 2018-10-12 21:16:17 I think oil wells on campus would be larger concerns than a subway tunnel...
1405 2018-10-12 21:16:12 I got oil too
1406 2018-10-12 21:15:57 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1407 2018-10-12 21:15:43 I understand from a climate perspective, oil demand growth falling towards a flatline and then staying there for some while (like coal) is nothing to get enthusiastic about. However, because commodity markets are ultra sensitive at the margin, that's my focus: Oil+Car industries.

Atiku has promised the 11 aspirants that contested against him an oil block each when elected president in 2019.

He made the promise according to a reliable source present at the meeting. 

He assured  of carrying them along in all his decisions.

1414 2018-10-12 21:15:11 Wasn’t aware Scotland had ever been asked ?- there are a lot of jobs in Grangemouth dependant on fracked gas and the gas and oil we do use also have significant side effects, seen lots of emotions but few facts on this.
1415 2018-10-12 21:15:05 @hissyomarbarbie  will soon drop the winner on that boobs thread.

Let me get my pears baby oil ready. We die here.
1416 2018-10-12 21:15:01 Same for me. I was on morphine, endone, lyrica, mersyndol forte, pethedine, valium, citalopram, maxalon.. just to name a few. Got dwn to 38kgs on them.. shd be 65. Nearly died. All replaced wth cannabis oil. No side effects. Hair use to fall out, wd scratch constantly on opiates.
1417 2018-10-12 21:14:59 Are you literally arguing that the Alberta carbon tax is causing the WORLD WIDE PRICE OF OIL to drop?  Really?
1418 2018-10-12 21:14:59 But if you looks at the top right hand did in that greens grassy spout that use to be oil there they mined it all out and put it back to a better state they only show what they want you to see wish I could afford a helicopter to take pictures of the better side of oil sands
1419 2018-10-12 21:14:54 Mix tea tree oil in a spray bottle with water I have always sprayed my dogs every other day with this and never had fleas or ticks. I don't know if it gets rid of them but is a great preventer.
1420 2018-10-12 21:14:49 What are they without oil wealth?
1421 2018-10-12 21:14:49 If you know wetin I don face ehn you will understand but I've decide I'm gonna get beard oil and grow it well
1422 2018-10-12 21:14:49 Yeah but he wasn't getting 8 mill back then Craig. If the Oil puts all their best players on one line it gets pretty thin for talent on the Other lines. Do like Chicago with Kane and Toews put Connor and Leon together when necessary.
1423 2018-10-12 21:14:48 after getting my vehicle maintenanced , oil changed , rotors machined , & a new set of tires  .... i dont want one anymore . yall can have that shit
1424 2018-10-12 21:14:44 This is why you are begging for money. Who in their right mind spends 102 on an oil change? Da fak
1425 2018-10-12 21:14:43 Hummus is chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and olive oil, and people from different parts of the middle East make it with different proportions of those ingredients. Black bean hummus is...a white people thing. Probably delicious, but not traditional at all.

1433 2018-10-12 21:13:41 Yes every time you change oil
1434 2018-10-12 21:13:39 Actually, on that note, I agree and I think we are heading in a good direction, if a little behind schedule. Koch industries is starting to invest in polymer tech because they are realizing oil is becoming less profitable.
1435 2018-10-12 21:13:31 I'm sorry, but the high school had an actual Oil Derrick on its grounds... and you're upset about public TRANSIT? You are clearly opposed to making LA a better and more carbon-neutral city.
1436 2018-10-12 21:13:20 Congrats to @AtlasGrowers on their cultivation AND oil production licence!!! MASSIVE and perfectly constructed facility made this EP process though HC in record time! 12 days to be exact #humblebrag #cciproud

1438 2018-10-12 21:13:14 Its long overdue that the deep pocket oil patch should start fighting back with their legal depts.These activist are out to destroy their businesses and peoples livelihoods .Fight Back!!!
1439 2018-10-12 21:13:14 Not sure if you’ve tried actual coconut oil but it worked for me when I was pregnant!

1441 2018-10-12 21:13:09 Harry Maguire or whatever his name is was a very boring Spiderman
1442 2018-10-12 21:12:55 So that’s a yes. Saudi can easily shift the conversation from a dead journalist to oil production very easily. It’s called realpolitik. Again, how many 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? Most, right?
1443 2018-10-12 21:12:44 But will it lower price at the pump for the citizens that live in this arctic environment and pay a national high at the pump? Its funny Rapper West showed Trump a should be presidential Hydrogen Aircraft photo..but Trump just purchased a new air force 1.Trump is oil & coal! Lol
1444 2018-10-12 21:12:40 I'll donate anointing oil for the forehead... LoL
1445 2018-10-12 21:12:32 All of these and we borrowed to pay civil servants salaries under @GEJonathan despite high Oil price?

We aren't fools,Sir
1446 2018-10-12 21:12:30 They also want to dismantle the 1st and 2nd amendment
1447 2018-10-12 21:12:30 look i just paid $90 for an oil change. please don’t try to talk/date me if you can’t change oil because i refuse to pay this again!!
1448 2018-10-12 21:12:21 do you need to change oil filter??
1449 2018-10-12 21:12:19 Tomorrow is now here...burn the midnight oil 
1450 2018-10-12 21:12:16 Demand is only there because the other options are held from us. Oh yes, they will supply alright. But only their oil. We need to demand our right to choose.
1451 2018-10-12 21:12:14 I have an old Youk T-shirt I keep as an oil rag.
1452 2018-10-12 21:12:08 Jeremiah 31:12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of JEHOVAH, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the
1453 2018-10-12 21:12:07 It couldn't have happened without the greed of the West. True.

We've created so many problems, all in the name of oil & $$$$.
1454 2018-10-12 21:12:05 My room smells amazing right now. Olbas Oil everywhere 
1455 2018-10-12 21:11:53 Yeah they keep pulling more and more shit. Like how they placed pallets, empty oil barrels, and a dumpster for a bonfire in front of our trailer while we were at an event. We are going to start looking for a new camp. This is ridiculous.
1456 2018-10-12 21:11:46 Wallahi its just fun, KO a tafin kafana , amma I knew it was plotted ,its a paradigm shift, from his renowned position of Ass licking, always trying to come fr u to gain cheap popularity, he should show us receipt of ppl nominating me fr d category if it wasn't doctored.
1457 2018-10-12 21:11:38 I got an Amazon package coming to my parents house with an orange bob wig, LED light up cowboy hat, wig caps, tea tree oil, and pasties. I hope my parents open it!
1458 2018-10-12 21:11:33 Prof yellows haba..this should not be part of the award we want to see...you should exclude it..we are just here for fun and not beef each other
1459 2018-10-12 21:11:30 ok also! another talking point is that oil corps are the main cause of climate change which is debatable, and use that as an excuse against making individual choices. they b like “we have to fight corporations & energy companies instead!!” like sisters how??
1460 2018-10-12 21:11:20 Por ahí hay el contrato de transporte de fuel oil a Celec .
1461 2018-10-12 21:11:12 We don't dare upset the Saudis because THE OIL.

Meanwhile, they're going to continue sponsoring terrorism abroad, bombing innocent civilians in Yemen (with aircraft they bought from us), and continuing with massive human rights abuses at home.

Stay calm. Remember THE OIL.
1462 2018-10-12 21:11:05 Hot7ie peppermint oil on your scalp or lavandr oil w nami 
1463 2018-10-12 21:11:00 I could honestly drink truffle oil like it's water
1464 2018-10-12 21:10:59 If reporters who say you are guilty until you are proven innocent make the claim "power in Saudi Arabia has traditionally centered in blood and oil"

 Why has U.S. been involved in Saudi oil since 1933

Saudis may be involved like in 9/11 but Prince Salman himself may be innocent
1465 2018-10-12 21:10:56 It seems to me that having a school where there's oil wells is the big issue.
1466 2018-10-12 21:10:36 Go in for an oil change they try and finesse you for the whole damn car overhaul lol. AND I DRIVE A NEW 2018 Jeep fam lol. Like I know it’s cool
1467 2018-10-12 21:10:33 How do you think we get our oil and gas just now ?
1468 2018-10-12 21:10:33 Still not getting the message. There can be no more oil and gas used after 2050. Stop spending money on searching for something you can't use and spend it on something you can use. And why dray up the old "energy leaders" who are only know about selling energy.
1469 2018-10-12 21:10:32 Got home this late, shops around closed, sister boiled only rice and failed to cook stew, mum came back home later and under 10mins palm oil and crayfish was used to cook stew... and it tastes like tomatoes stew.
Mothers are a blessing 
1470 2018-10-12 21:10:27 When I got home from the Gulf .My mother recorded all the news while it was happening.Huge stack of VHS videos! A lot of the reports bore little resemblance to the reality on the ground.Sadam setting fire to oil wells?No it was us  realised then it was all a lie!#WWG1WGA

1473 2018-10-12 21:10:19 The Saudi Nation was created by oil companies,  and protected by the USA since came into existence.
1474 2018-10-12 21:10:13 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this October? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1478 2018-10-12 21:09:49 四暗刻さんおはありです！
1479 2018-10-12 21:09:46 Alternative perspective: 3.7 Million people (in Indonesian alone) making their ‘daily bread’ in the palm oil industry. Mankind isn’t as cute but I say #MankindFirst
1480 2018-10-12 21:09:46 Wait are we talking about politicians or people? I'm fine with people having their own political viewpoints but I take serious umbrage with a political party that insists on trickle-down economics and takes big oil money while denying hard climate change science.
1481 2018-10-12 21:09:34 yesss i feel you, paid $105 for my oil change yesterday 
1482 2018-10-12 21:09:20 DO YOU REMEMBER when you were in St Petersburg and you couldn’t get the door open because you’d put too much oil on your brass hand?
1483 2018-10-12 21:09:19 hey did you read my longest..sensiblest..reply to you on LSE ?

1485 2018-10-12 21:09:10 Exactly why ion like coming to get my oil changed they always find some shit I NEED to get done to my car then I spend more money than I intended to 
1486 2018-10-12 21:09:07 The sprays are a really wonderful way to get an immediate boost. I've been misting around my head and my computer before getting to work every day, to help maintain focus and keep things from going wrong. The oil can be used in the same way but is less of a nitrous jolt 
1487 2018-10-12 21:09:03 We sold the SPR when Oil was at $20.
We have to be friends with them now. 


1488 2018-10-12 21:09:02 US says, It's ‘Not helpful’ that India plans to buy Russia’s S-400 missile & Iran oil.

Trump indicates, India will soon know if it would be hit by punitive sanctions for buying Russian arms.

Shouldn't be surprised if we hear about a big arms deal with US soon!
1489 2018-10-12 21:08:54 The oil sands will never be sustainable, not just environmentally, but also economically, it just takes too much work and too much cost to process it into usable oil. Without super high oil prices which will probably never happen again, it will takes money out of the economy.
1490 2018-10-12 21:08:54 Morning: hydrating face wash, witch hazel toner w/ aloe vera, rosewater spray, marula oil, moisturizer. 

Night: oil cleanser (if I'm wearing makeup), face wash, glycolic acid toner, rose hip oil, moisturizer. 

Sometimes it varies but that's my general routine.
1491 2018-10-12 21:08:43 Lmao. You seem pained, as you said it doesn't define you, it's just twitter afterall.
1492 2018-10-12 21:08:41 I'm reminded now to get my car into Jiffy Lube for its oil change.
1493 2018-10-12 21:08:40 Time to take over Canada and steal their oil reserves
1494 2018-10-12 21:08:38 My baby girl just launched her palm oil/honey business. I’m so proud of her. We move  Money making gang. Igbo girls don’t play 
1495 2018-10-12 21:08:37 This is a VERY bad Tweet. Should be deleted & replaced w/ suggestion that:

a) Is grounded in the context of the horrific crimes of the oil industry
b) Winds industry down & lessens its political power (i.e., end subsidies & nationalize)
c) Stays the hell away from geoengineering
1496 2018-10-12 21:08:27 I’m Really Addicted To Plug In’s, Oil Burners , Candles I Can’t Go In The Store And Not Grab It &’ I Burn Fabulouso On A Daily

1508 2018-10-12 21:07:08 Inspiring to hear the mayor of Lafayette, @robideaux pitch about diversifying city economies to include culture and the creative industries because “it’s us and we can control it” as opposed to oil and gas, or other industries. #MusicCitiesLafayette
1509 2018-10-12 21:07:07 oil pulling is literally life.

1512 2018-10-12 21:06:46 Just agreed to go to Portland on a whim but I debated for 6 months on what essential oil diffuser to buy.
1513 2018-10-12 21:06:44 Prediction- I’d  bet they’ll go with: threat of higher rates from Fed due to a stronger economy; higher tariffs from trade wars; loss of profitable Saudi trade deals due to possible sanctions;Higher oil costs.  I’m not an NYT economist- Just a guess.
1514 2018-10-12 21:06:36 To be honest, I tend to stick with 100% pure beeswax tea lights and add a few drops of essential oil to the holder. Beeswax emits negative ions which clean the air! The @CelticHerbal candle we both have is another alternative  x
1515 2018-10-12 21:06:17 What booming economy? My retirement is going down the tubes. And FYI, oil is about to tank, too...
1516 2018-10-12 21:06:15 Being an adult is bullshit. $70 for an oil change and then $74 for my tags. Like tf

1518 2018-10-12 21:06:12 I was working a shite help desk job for a soulless oil corp when I first stumbled across a band of nerdy-ass voice actors playing out fantastical adventure whom so graciously invited me and a multitude of others to join them in that journey. I needed it. #ThanksVoxMachina

1525 2018-10-12 21:05:35 thought i’d let u know that last night i took vegetable oil to the sesh thinking it was lime cordial 
1526 2018-10-12 21:05:25 absolutely not. geoengineering is a pipe dream at best, harmful at worst. we need immediate solutions & dismantling oil/methane companies while taxing big carbon emitters and transitioning to renewable sources is a far quicker, safer, and more reliable solution to emissions.

1530 2018-10-12 21:04:38 Extracting oil, gas here is a lot cheaper than shipping it here. We have a huge oil supply around where I live. Matter of fact they are calling it the largest in US

1532 2018-10-12 21:04:27 The bribed GOP's are doing all they can to kill our countries democracy by Russian's & Saudis big money oil influences and Russia's hacking our voting systems
1533 2018-10-12 21:04:10 Sir what so ever you are doing is good.. But if you want to win this time then give us, The people of India the reason behind the rise in the petrol prices. The same indian oil in Nepal and Bhutan are provided in so low cost at a difference of about Rs50. Justify us.
1534 2018-10-12 21:04:09 Yea i remembered when u call him dat  but dont take it personal its just for fun
1535 2018-10-12 21:04:05 YEAH! YEAH !! YEAH!!! That's why my pumping gas went from .98 (3 yrs ago - low) a liter to the present $1.28 --- The big oil motherfuckers always bleed us 24-7.
1536 2018-10-12 21:04:01 Triple anything ETF’s are only a good hold for day trades. Way too much price erosion due to leveraged bets. If the oil market stayed flat every day, the price would eventually go to zero.
1537 2018-10-12 21:03:26 I used to live right next to BHHS, just south of Olympic.Always found it shocking that an oil well on school property was totally ok but a subway beneath the school somehow absolutely unacceptable.I’m talking 10 years ago.The purple line could have been built many times over now

1539 2018-10-12 21:03:23 Oil companies knowingly destroyed the planet for profits, their time has come. Their assets should be seized and invested in planting trees and renewable energy. Either we take them down or they’re taking us down with them.

1543 2018-10-12 21:02:45 Time ran out but thanks for the heads up! The final caller was very interesting! He left the conversation on a cliff hanger - that we are not running out of oil (& therefore gas) suggesting that in fact, it is abiotic & not  a fossil fuel which the Russians have said for years!

1546 2018-10-12 21:02:18 Para conseguir oil lo mejor es hacer una y otra vez las expediciones, así además también consigues puntos para el backyard, si estás jugando muchas horas, pon las que tardan 1 hora o 2 y ganarás bastante.

También si puedes evitarlo no juegues con 6 barcos, gasta muchísimo

1557 2018-10-12 21:01:16 The lead story on pnp should be that Canadian oil is selling for $20 u.s a barrel!! Price differential is $50!!! We lose $50 a barrel to the Americans if this story effected Quebec or Ontario the liberals would be compensating producers #pnpcbc

1569 2018-10-12 21:00:12 Best part, it only takes two pots! Cook your starch separate, drain and let sit. Chop up equal-ish parts onion, celery, carrots and potato. With your other pot use butter or oil and saute some chopped garlic, then put your boneless chicken parts in. Saute until golden brown 2/?

1588 2018-10-12 20:57:46 I can't read that crap (vomit-prone). Does it mention selling off public lands to GOP donors (#TheSwamp) for stripping of resources, or forcing pipelines through Native American waterways for Canadian oil to be sold elsewhere?
1589 2018-10-12 20:57:41 Or... we could regulate oil companies & stop bribing them. You’re awful, Ro.
1590 2018-10-12 20:57:25 They knew all that. Andre milongo proved it in 1991, mouamba and his UPADS bum buddies went after oil when they got a chance. Resign if you can’t do the job.
1591 2018-10-12 20:57:24 At least they did a lot whether with higher or lower oil prices.... Tell us how many project your baba GoSlow has commissioned. You better remove that cap and receive sense.
1592 2018-10-12 20:57:17 It probably will, Jayme. Anything is possible with coconut oil.
1593 2018-10-12 20:57:04 Beto is WRONG FOR TEXAS.  He's already voted for a $10 tax on every barrel of Texan oil and never explains himself.  He just goes his own ver-liberal way without regard to the good of the people. HE's NOT MADE FOR THE SENATE NOR FOR TEXAS.
1594 2018-10-12 20:57:02 oh man...i just soaked my hair in jojoba oil and sunflower oil.... LIFE CHANGING!!!
1595 2018-10-12 20:56:48 The US is no longer tied to SA oil imports. Our problem with them is the huge amount of money that they’ve spent on Trump properties, effectively buying the president of the United States.
1596 2018-10-12 20:56:43 I could go for a pint of oil
1597 2018-10-12 20:56:33 And likely go up 5 cents on Monday. Possibly higher if there's a natural disaster affecting supply or whatever excuse the oil companies feed us...
1598 2018-10-12 20:56:29 And, then there's Strictly. Is there dancing in Saudi Arabia? Women have just started driving. No alcohol. Shared value's? Oil dependency. Market for arms.

1603 2018-10-12 20:55:55 The high prices for petrol will be enough to get people to think about alternatives (i.e public transport, electric vehicles, the waiwai express), but there needs to be a bigger incentive to stop using oil altogether. #nationnz

1607 2018-10-12 20:55:15 The truth might be completely different, it just to divert public attention from current dollar price and oil price increase............see no one talk now about petrol price.......@Vikramwalke @Satyapraneeth3
1608 2018-10-12 20:55:13 He's the perfect contraindicator.  He said we would never see $40 oil again when it was in the 30's. I went long.

1615 2018-10-12 20:54:17 How about we disband oil companies and seize their assets
1616 2018-10-12 20:54:03 .. re current 20 $ 'Canadian Oil Price' 

Canadian Mainstream Media seems flummoxed

Do they truly believe frozen ground hamburger would be priced as tenderloin if only there were more trucks to get it to market ? Would they re-label the hamburger as tenderloin then ? Really ?
1617 2018-10-12 20:54:01 Looking forward to spending tomorrow with @marini_alessio at his farm Fattoria Di Tullio in beautiful Abruzzo. Alessio makes all the fantastic E.V. Olive oil we use on our pizza and we can’t wait to see the farm. We will be back @elymarkets on the 20th, with new ideas.
1618 2018-10-12 20:53:41 No, we’re CHOOSING Beto because he’s not a serpent covered in Vaseline. Ted Cruz has been bought and paid for by big oil, big healthcare companies, gun lobby and Koch.

1643 2018-10-12 20:51:18 The biggest polluter is a Saudi state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. They refine their oil in the United States, are partly funded by the United States government, Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger.

The ninth biggest polluter is ExxonMobil.
1644 2018-10-12 20:51:02 If we’d invest more in alternative transportation we could change the amount of petrol being burned. 
Not saying we can quit burning precious petrol 100%, but we can do a lot better than now.

Oil firms and multi billionaire stock holders are deceiving us for their quick buck.
1645 2018-10-12 20:50:54 @CanadianTire took an appointment for oil change and one hour passed my car still where I parked it. Truly disappointing. My time is valuable certainly not for your employees. No more dealing with CT.
1646 2018-10-12 20:50:53 Sounds like a pretty unsafe place to have a school already. Should likely condemn it to keep the kids safe: Korbatov’s website claims that ground below the high school is “littered with abandoned oil wells and saturated with methane gas and oil.
1647 2018-10-12 20:50:50 What is nonsensical are the people thinking that we need to keep investing in oil. Retarded really. It’s only good so rich old guys can keep making money.
1648 2018-10-12 20:50:36 ......and CBD oil ?
1649 2018-10-12 20:50:35 They told me it was gonna take 45 mins to change my oil, but it’s been an hour & 20...

1656 2018-10-12 20:50:06 @realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. Dumass, Saudi hasn’t paid for anything, no weapons or systems.  You are so influenced by money, realized or unrealized.  BTW, if we are so awash in oil, why do we import oil from Saudi Arabia? #drainthetrump
1657 2018-10-12 20:50:05 Use engine oil 
1658 2018-10-12 20:49:42 And yet we still sell them military hardware and buy their oil.
1659 2018-10-12 20:49:29 purchasing some geranium essential oil for my diffuser is one of the best things I’ve done!!! my whole room smells like roses now YES
1660 2018-10-12 20:49:25 I'm cracking up at "witches or vegans." Reminds me of traveling in the South and passing "Donuts and Oil Changes."
1661 2018-10-12 20:49:13 Ridiculously low oil prices, hockey team may still be uncompetitive and the weather sucks. Not feeling a lot of #yeg love today.
1662 2018-10-12 20:49:09 We need to look forward... the future is not oil and gas. I want to hear conversations about solutions, carbon reduction and what’s next. You are getting very boring harping on and on about the tax. Change is painful but it’s time. I want solutions

It’s a sunset industry that will crash economies that are over-invested in oil.

Diversity of energy generation modalities is our present, & our future. Sun, wind, hydro & geothermal already, wave generation in trials. Sustainable transition to energy independence.
1665 2018-10-12 20:48:58 For nausea, there’s an OTC med called Emetrol (all natural) and works wonders. For pain, I’ve used CBD oil & Kratom. I also recommend a chakra balancing with focus on your solar plexus. It’ll get out any old energy & pent up stress.
1666 2018-10-12 20:48:56 lacie coconut oil fixes all problems right?
1667 2018-10-12 20:48:49 If we split Cali up we could try  several social experiments for a year or two and the winner could be selected and used under reunification let’s face it people the world is changing pretty damn fast Robots /Divide between rich and poor /solar tech vrs oil
1668 2018-10-12 20:48:48 Why? Because like so many in the world I realize that we can move away from oil. We actually have too either we die or we fall behind or both. Why is this nonsensical? Why do you oil to keep going? Your job? Investments? #timetomoveon
1669 2018-10-12 20:48:46 Jammer has needed beard oil since 2006

1671 2018-10-12 20:48:40 O..so they DON'T want our $100 billion in help for hurricane damage????...Or billions more to fix mess from Horizon oil explosion?..ok ..
1672 2018-10-12 20:48:22 So you support our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump in his mission to end all American wars, and his speaking out against allies and EU countries who are currently making deals with dangerous govts to attain their oil in exchange for $$ that will be used to fund terrorism?
1673 2018-10-12 20:48:16 I guess you have never worked in oil and gas, so you don't know the enormous amount of effort goes into dragging a barrel of crude out of the ground before and after. Hint: It doesn't come prepackaged in barrels sitting to be picked up.
1674 2018-10-12 20:48:03 That is the cost of a coffee per week. NZ economy continues to perform strongly! More people in employment earning more dollars per hour. My belief; Oil supply increases ex USA fracking industry will again bring the world price of oil below usd50 within six months. Stop moaning.
1675 2018-10-12 20:48:01 No bish it’s called oil pulling, you swish it in your mouth. Look it up
1676 2018-10-12 20:47:57 It’s too bad the oilers cancelled oil change. What a show
1677 2018-10-12 20:47:56 The oil from my nose, I kid you not
1678 2018-10-12 20:47:50 Oil up the tats
1679 2018-10-12 20:47:47 small brain: reducing emissions is too hard—do geoengineering

normal brain: incentivize oil companies to reduce emissions... somehow

expanding brain: dismantle oil companies so we can actually reduce emissions

galaxy brain: incentivize oil companies to help with geoengineering
1680 2018-10-12 20:47:46 I made an appointment a few hours ago to get my oil changed on Monday.  So far, I've gotten two e-mails, a text message and a phone call reminding me.
1681 2018-10-12 20:47:32 Lies, deceit, oil and a monarchy?
1682 2018-10-12 20:47:24 Oooh give it a good clean first, that oil smells naaaasty
1683 2018-10-12 20:47:20 Maybe Trump wants Saudi Arabia to be unstable, cause chaos to reduce oil production and fight climate change? @Rob_Malley @DanielLarison

1685 2018-10-12 20:47:10 as long as big oil and money corrupt politics there will never be any true accountability....sad, just sad. the world has been held hostage by this for decades.
1686 2018-10-12 20:47:03 Anyone need any more evidence that oil has us by the short hairs and still makes the world go round? It doesn't have to be that way.
1687 2018-10-12 20:46:46 Well, انا بستخدم "Jojoba oil"
او زيت الهوهوبا و الصبار و الخروع.
بقصقص اطراف شعري كل ٣ شهور و بعد ما اغسل شعري بالشاموا بستخدم مرطب بحيث لم اجي اسرحوا ما يتقطع.
بعملوا ضفاير بعد ما اغسله و انشفه و اسيبه يتشف للاخر بعد كده بخت من زيت الهوهوبا ده و وقت تاني من الخروع و الصبار.
1688 2018-10-12 20:46:34 Lmao for real! She used to turn me ON. Then Kyrie and PND fucked over here. Then she started looking like she played with car oil all day
1689 2018-10-12 20:46:20 But... I thought he was spraying garbage into the air and polluting the entire world?! I heard he even told those rescuers to leave those cute little dawn ducks covered in oil! 
1690 2018-10-12 20:46:15 it’s in oil!!! acrylic could work too but the blurry back light might be pretty difficult to achieve with acrylic

1693 2018-10-12 20:46:07 Stop saying cooking oil pliz
1694 2018-10-12 20:45:54 @Megan_Woods is right on the money today on @NewshubNationNZ 

Energy supply is not as dependent on oil as your ill-informed journalism would have viewers think.

Oil is a sunset industry, get over it. We lead the world in geothermal energy generation & other clean tech.
1695 2018-10-12 20:45:51 Doesn't oil demand rise until ICEs sold < ICEs retired, each year? LDV sales were 50MM 15 years ago, and commercial vehicles were 20MM 6 years ago. So don't we need ICE < 70MM before hitting that tipping point? Wouldn't ever-more air travel consume that oil (as kerosene)?
1696 2018-10-12 20:45:48 Welcome to the bear market.  Keep asking the right questions. Nice shot at the old oil guy just now.

Then I hittem with, 

"Cause I'mma sex machine!"
1705 2018-10-12 20:45:07 At that level too. Richard Branson has been warning of climate change for ages. He owns an airline. Oil companies want a carbon tax.

1709 2018-10-12 20:44:44 So they can take selfies while standing in front of Saudi oil wells.
1710 2018-10-12 20:44:43 The Senate on Thursday narrowly confirmed Jeffrey Bossert Clark, a lawyer who defended BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to be assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Environment and Natural Resources Division. WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR THIS PERSON???
1711 2018-10-12 20:44:30 should I even show ppl ur tire ... or the fact that u haven’t changed ur oil since u got the car ... or the fact that u literally take the curve on ur road 40 when it’s supposed to be a 10 ..
1712 2018-10-12 20:44:28 #POTUS45 danced clumsily with a sword when he visited Saudi Arabia. He will do anything, IMO, to get Saudi oil. Never mind that the Bin Laden clan comes from there.

1717 2018-10-12 20:43:48 Thought there was recession because global crude oil prices went low and now its high that’s why we are out of it and stable. We need to discourage overdependant on crude oil, than trying to glorify someone where no effort was put to resolve the crisis.....
1718 2018-10-12 20:43:34 i hate getting an oil change bc they always tell me a million other things wrong w my car & i have to act like ik what they’re talking about
1719 2018-10-12 20:43:27 you still need tire rotations every 7500 miles, which is about the same interval as an oil change on an modern ICE
1720 2018-10-12 20:43:27 Fleets presumably have people making minimum wage dealing with oil changes.
1721 2018-10-12 20:43:24 I can’t find gummy worms for less than 10 cents. The Oil finally didn’t over pay!
1722 2018-10-12 20:43:09 I kinda am with sim settlements bc ppl will build their own stuff without supplies and I got an immersive fast travel mod but you gotta make fuel from oil lol

1733 2018-10-12 20:41:20 also too nice cameo by the oil derrick at the baseball diamond
1734 2018-10-12 20:41:13 Action means a new paradigm of thinking. Taxing polluting industries does nothing. The reality is that current infrastructures in industries, such as oil refineries cannot be changed. This means continued pollution.
1735 2018-10-12 20:41:00 OK follow-on question. When you buy oil, what volume do you buy?

1745 2018-10-12 20:39:52 That's really funny when @BetoORourke receives NO money from PAC's, & @tedcruz is paid for by NRA, Dark Money from Russia, big Oil, 3-D guns org, & Mercer's. He kisses Trump's patooty daily, even tho DT said his wife was ugly & his dad was in cahoots w/ Oswald. But, okay, Laura.
1746 2018-10-12 20:39:47 Those are donations without any PAC $. Beto’s largest contributors? Educators.  @tedcruz largest contributors? Banks, oil & gas. Ted has taken $47 million from sources outside Texas. That’s 50% MORE than Beto. Next you’ll accuse Beto of being a “lobbyist” for his constituents.

1753 2018-10-12 20:39:19 Seek the oil that starts in the medulla, travels from our brains down our spine to the sacrum to return back up our 33 vertebrae, through our pons and the final destination the pineal gland. Everything starts within.
1754 2018-10-12 20:39:10 Oil cleansers are the best thing to melt off makeup. It breaks down anything waterproof. After that, you’ll need to wash off the oil. A regular gentle foaming cleanser would work.
1755 2018-10-12 20:39:03 Do me a favor look on the table and grab that baby oil
1756 2018-10-12 20:38:57 Of course. I used to travel all over the world back then and I would tell anyone interested that Saudi Arabia was the most dangerous country in the world for Americans. The citizens HATE us. We support their oppressors just for oil and military bases.
1757 2018-10-12 20:38:46 what's oil shiekh doing in that category lmaoooooooo you people are not nice

The people funding the effort to oppose 112 don’t live in areas where exposure to the toxic chemicals are a problem.

Those oil execs live in Houston. Not next door to the fracking well in Sterling. They don’t care about Colorado, only profits.
1771 2018-10-12 20:37:33 Keep receiving your self, can he account for all the loan he has taken since he came in. Can he account for all the crude oil sales that has happened since 2015, with all the subsidy spent so far. Can he vouch for the honesty and sincerity of all his appointees. Let me hear word
1772 2018-10-12 20:37:32 Joke aside, in the world we live in today, if this were a conversation between two conservatives, liberals heads would explode and the MSM would be reporting it 24/7.  #LiberalDoubleStandards
1773 2018-10-12 20:37:26 You have no oil in your car

1775 2018-10-12 20:37:00 One of our major problems in Nigeria is lack of adequate database! A country that rely solely on crude oil don't even know the accurate figure of barrels we uses on a daily basis. How will such a country have effective database for pensioners, citizens etc? We need database.

1781 2018-10-12 20:36:26 Remember when the price of oil crashed and the most vocal, “Gov needs to support me and my family, and get me more work!” were UCP supporting dickheads.
1782 2018-10-12 20:36:20 Oil companies should be destroyed. Not repurposed.
1783 2018-10-12 20:36:10 Depends on what the butt stuff is. I'm all for it to be spanked/whipped, rubbing it(with oil, lotion, and other creamy substances) for it to be kissed, and grinding it into your lap while some music is playing in the background.
1784 2018-10-12 20:35:58 and most of the hijackers on 9/11 were saudis If they didn't have oil They be less popular that Iran
1785 2018-10-12 20:35:57 So @Megan_Woods on @NewshubNationNZ doesn't see the hypocrisy of banning oil exploration but forcing ports to allow more companies to import oil?

1788 2018-10-12 20:35:43 What about the billions the oil industry hands out?

1791 2018-10-12 20:35:25 Why not work on biodiesel instead of asking for trouble by increasing the amount of ethanol in gasoline?! Diesel engines at their onset only used vegetable oil!
1792 2018-10-12 20:35:19 Did you know it's actually cheaper using renewable energy, we already at that stage, it's just the big oil companies have too much power at the moment, they are bigger investors in the governments than what a solar panel is, as it brings in no tax

1797 2018-10-12 20:34:56 When do you stop importing their oil.
1798 2018-10-12 20:34:52 Saudi impunity is based on the Faustian bargain between the US & the House of Saud: The US guarantees the security of the Saudi state in return for the Saudis selling oil in dollars, thus assuring the survivability of the US dollar as the de facto reserve currency of the world.
1799 2018-10-12 20:34:46 Vous avez choisi de nous empoisonner et de polluer comme un gros sale, tout en mettant encore plus gravement la vie des piétons en danger. C’est la moindre des choses de payer un malus.

1814 2018-10-12 20:32:44 How about healthcare, education, Medicare, and social security? If we are doing so great why do we subsidize Big Oil Companies? Why do they need our tax money when they continue to record Billions in quarterly profit??

1877 2018-10-12 20:26:20 This may be true, however climate change at present is irreversible despite what the biased reports may say. Look how fracking is allowed in UK despite its dangers. Polar ice is melting n oil giants r rushing to exploit. This is cold reality. It is our swan song we sing.
1878 2018-10-12 20:26:16 Jared must be a scared middleman. Trump certainly could not give Jared the money. Jr is just bumping his gums. Remember IN THE BEGINNING "Trump wanted the oil" slightly empowered like the bully boy he was in boarding/military school with heel spurs on neither foot.
1879 2018-10-12 20:26:08 The problem is oil. Petro dollar economy and greedy people selling us oil to live and telling us the world is being polluted by fossil fuels in the same breath. We need free energy and sustainable green infrastructure. But good luck convincing saudis to give up oil.

1894 2018-10-12 20:24:04 Basically, I think it might be the actual structure and composition of the ETF that is obscuring the picture and not reflecting the true industry returns of the largest producers compared to amount of oil produced by each component.

1907 2018-10-12 20:22:01 I also wonder if an ETF that weights a tiny company like $LPI nearly the same as a giant like $XOM can really capture a true industry picture of returns compared to oil itself. $XLE seems to do a little better job since 2006
1908 2018-10-12 20:21:55 Right change them every time the oil gets changed
1909 2018-10-12 20:21:54 Unfortunately Trump does not understand Saudis, they don't care about US, 25 billion is not enough to sell our standards and bow to.All Saudis care about is selling their oil. Killing someone in another country is beyond decency. We should stand up and fight this savage act.

1920 2018-10-12 20:20:23 today I realized that regularly moisturizing your body is not just a #concept

I hate getting lotion/oil/cream on my sheets or clothes so I straight up just never moisturize  and the way my skin felt today let me know I need to adjust my priorities
1921 2018-10-12 20:20:11 We use 24/7 and have done for the past 50 years. Funny, because if Scotland has all the oil you Seps think it has, that’s a pretty good reason for invasion. Grow up.

1932 2018-10-12 20:19:08 He was only any good at suppressing voters, environmentalists, scientists and aligning himself with the oil companies while kissing Yankee ass to keep the US war machine happy, while lying to Parliament when he wasn't in contempt of it.
1933 2018-10-12 20:19:01 Ian Wood was forced into another sea industry when the oil ran out just before the referendum.
1934 2018-10-12 20:18:59 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
1935 2018-10-12 20:18:57 Oh, I forgot to mention, warm coconut oil and a full body massage.
1936 2018-10-12 20:18:56 Studies suggest transportation accounts for up to 24 percent of climate-polluting emissions, a close second to the oil and gas industry. Nothing on its own will fix the problem, but it seems greening our commutes is a really good start. Moreso than doing nothing.

1938 2018-10-12 20:18:55 The illustration you provided was pixelated not showing figures or a source. We can speculate all day long, facts remain John, the PM can not unilaterally lay a pipeline down. Invoking emergency powers to do so to counter a temporary dip in oil prices is irresponsible. Bad idea.

1943 2018-10-12 20:18:11 I think when you trade a player that good, there’s no way you can really win the deal. No matter what you get back you still gave up the best player in the league. Having McDavid gives the Oil a better chance to win.
1944 2018-10-12 20:18:10 Brand new cars will make you angry when you’re paying monthly but listen, fixed my today and it was under warrantee. Also have had free oil changes since I got the car. The only thing I spend money on is gas, oh and I got the shit zero down. God bless abroad

1985 2018-10-12 20:15:00 you mean the credit card company? Its a weak link but think- Oil companies  don't need t pay a BSc on opinion. There are thousands of honest PhD geochemists who see the modelling for what it is, useful, but are more happy with geochemical data that suggests heating is 1deg/100y
1986 2018-10-12 20:14:53 Yeah I saw in the tweets they were worried the digging could cause the oil wells on campus to explode. So weird.
1987 2018-10-12 20:14:40 You forgot the ever popular; "Canada is a net-negative polluter..." I heard that from my Dad last week. He's ignoring the fact that the oil sands alone make our Carbon footprint massive and that the climate doesn't give a shit about borders.
1988 2018-10-12 20:14:34 Send a link to that quote. Can't find.  The only one i can find is when he  accused OBJ for trading sex for oil blocks

1992 2018-10-12 20:14:07 Do you listen to yourself? So you're saying climate change causes workers to work in uncomfortable indoor climate conditions, which in turn limits workers ability to actually do the work? Are they liberals? Adjusting the thermostat might work unless climate change is energy/oil..

1995 2018-10-12 20:13:59 Gas prices are ridiculous as are the explanations given to us. Price of oil goes up, gas prices go up, price of oil goes down, gas prices go up. A mosquito farts in India, gas prices go up. #pricefairytails the price is whatever they can get away with.

2005 2018-10-12 20:12:49 USA needs CDN Hvy+Lite oil. We supply 12% to 20% of US refinery needs. If they don't get it from us, they will import it from other countries or will produce it themselves. So, will world GHGs be any better? No, they will not. Canada GHGs go down, while others rise.

2020 2018-10-12 20:11:13 Instead of second guessing @elonmusk intentions we should be asking “what are the Koch bros, Hamm, Putin and the other oil business billionaires doing to help the planet?” These guys get stinking rich by fueling the planet’s demise. At least Musk is funding something positive.

2025 2018-10-12 20:10:44 An alternative would have been to lean into the Iran Agreement and to push for further points of negotiation and encourage the more moderate wing and to exercise soft power

2027 2018-10-12 20:10:32 Interesting look at things. Somehow we’re ok to put the blame on users with plastic packaging but it’s the oil company’s fault with oil and gas. I think people need to take personal responsibility to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. Brands can help with materials and behaviour.

2036 2018-10-12 20:09:31 Yes. We are totally fine with it. We literally don't give a damn if the oil comes Venezuela,  Nigeria, or Hibernia. It is all poison and we need to get off oil ASAP.

2039 2018-10-12 20:09:16 That wasn’t my point. It’s that Saudis we’re allowed to fly out of U.S. even before anything precise was known. It had to do with oil. $$ rules the world.

2054 2018-10-12 20:07:31 Trumps logic:

We only import 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.

2060 2018-10-12 20:06:54 What's REALLY heartbreaking is that Republicans refuse to even acknowledge climate change is real (when even oil companies like Exxon agree that it is real) . . . and you sit and do NOTHING!! Americans are dying and losing their property as a result of your inaction!!
2061 2018-10-12 20:06:47 And what’s wrong with snake oil?
2062 2018-10-12 20:06:43 The "lackheads" on your nose are sebaceous filaments, normal and healthy collections of dead skin and oil around the hair follicles. #SoftBestFeed #SBF
2063 2018-10-12 20:06:38 Looking for the Fed paper on monetary policy as heroin (smile).

The Fed has increased M2 broad money stock 24x since 1970 and oil has tracked similar price increase. 

Since 1970, total debt/GDP has increased fr. 150% to 340%. 

The #Fed's work. 

#EndTheFed
2064 2018-10-12 20:06:35 Saudi Arabia is an oil rich and sovereign form of ISIS led by a corrupt monarchy
2065 2018-10-12 20:06:32 Schumer. Memo you are not the almighty. There isn’t only one thing that creates weather. Stop selling snake oil. Let’s have real discussions, not fear mongering.
2066 2018-10-12 20:06:27 YOUR ROOM?
2067 2018-10-12 20:06:26 Open fire with cast iron insert replaced in Caterham this week with a Mendip Loxton 3 SE, Riven Slate Hearths, Oak Beam finished in Teak Oil and the chamber sprayed black on request
2068 2018-10-12 20:06:18 (2/2) They pumped so much oil out of Long Beach, the land began to sink. What a shock? Their replacement strategy was pumping seawater in to dry wells. Big mistake. Then, it was concrete, after a toxic mixture of HCL was used to reopen the wells. Result : Poisoned land & water.
2069 2018-10-12 20:06:02 Chris got my oil changed, new breaks and rotors all $300  an bought me new pants!! He’s the best! 
2070 2018-10-12 20:05:59 Boy,@FastJackBeckman must of have done it good. Pleased there will be no penalty points for oil lay down in the #countdown .
2071 2018-10-12 20:05:38 And 8 new businesses there, the frequent use of his hotels and a lot of oil money.
2072 2018-10-12 20:05:34 This is just naive handwaving, Elon gives enough to have a chance to have his pro climate action arguments heard, nothing compared to the GOP oil/fossil fuel barrons that give 10’s of millions every election. Elon gives 100x more $ to @aclu and @SierraClub.
2073 2018-10-12 20:05:15 Either “Girl, you’ll be a woman soon” a reference to the well coming to fruition or “Let’s stay together” as a reference to shareholders hanging on in there!
2074 2018-10-12 20:04:59 Trudeau does not sell oil
2075 2018-10-12 20:04:51 They’re also very tasty fried up in a little coconut oil, Louis.
2076 2018-10-12 20:04:44 @MBuhari @APCNigeria @OfficialAPCNg @APCUKingdom @sunrisedailynow @KakaakiSocial Their constant refrain ‘mention one project @MBuhari started and finished in three years’. Me: mention any project started or inherited, and completed by the PDP from 1999 - 2015 oil revenue > $780b

2078 2018-10-12 20:04:29 Well, if the Saudis' backing of the 9/11 terrorists wasn't enough to make our government break its ties with them, it's hard to see why one more murder would.  It's always been about the money with them. First oil for the US, and now hotels for Trump.
2079 2018-10-12 20:04:22 Oil. That's how.
2080 2018-10-12 20:04:19 Good enough for me mate. Not sure how you’ll get on without our oil but there you go.
2081 2018-10-12 20:04:11 My essential oil package has made it to Cleveland but I won't get it till tomorrow  want to see a breakdown of seasonal essentials included?
2082 2018-10-12 20:04:10 The last part, does that mean that a lubricant such as oil or Shea will be used upon ones genitals to enhance its aesthetic features?
2083 2018-10-12 20:04:08 Have your man oil your scalp, that’s what I have my man do 
2084 2018-10-12 20:04:06 Mitch let's talk about the MURDER & DISMBERMENT of the Washington Post reporter, Jamal Khashoggi. Trump says he doesn't think he was an American citizen. He WAS a permanent resident & a HUMAN BEING! Let Saudi Arabia sell their oil somewhere else! SCREW them!
2085 2018-10-12 20:03:59 With/or some garlic and crunchy chilli oil. Cannot go wrong.
2086 2018-10-12 20:03:51 Ah ko ini ndadii? Nhamo dzinosiyana bhururu. Ini I was told to get membership cards for my villagers. That's what they want not cooking oil.
2087 2018-10-12 20:03:51 Such single estate olive oil can be trusted for  higher quality and purity.
2088 2018-10-12 20:03:50 I jut ran out of my lavender essential oil and I am not okay
2089 2018-10-12 20:03:48 Came in for a recall on my car nd now I’m getting a free oil change nice 
2090 2018-10-12 20:03:14 You slap some baby oil on dem cheeks and do some squats 
2091 2018-10-12 20:03:04 Vibrator need an oil change and tune up 
2092 2018-10-12 20:03:01 Arrrgh for 50+ years our economy is based only on one thing and one thing only. OIL! The indicators of a serious country that uses oil to diversify aren’t there, from ECA to Foreign Reserves, to Leveraging on Booming phases to diversify. You want quick fix in 3 years? Gerrout!
2093 2018-10-12 20:02:44 It sounds like most MSM "reporting" on the "legacy" of #JerryBrown - puff pieces & press releases that gloss over or don't discuss his #DeltaTunnels, expansion of #offshoredrilling, #BigOil-written #carbontrading & faux #marineprotectedareas created under an oil lobbyist's helm.
2094 2018-10-12 20:02:36 Add in some MCT oil to it. The kratom alkaloids are somewhat fat soluble and it tends to help extend the effects of strained kratom tea.
2095 2018-10-12 20:02:27 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
2096 2018-10-12 20:02:26 Oil free mein pani hota hai kya 
2097 2018-10-12 20:02:26 @adamcurry @THErealDVORAK the ipcc/oil/climate gate segment was not boring to me. This is the one common control structure the crypto eugenicists & technocrats are using on slaves around the world. So it's worth covering.
2098 2018-10-12 20:02:24 I look forward to your 2019 election platform wherein you promise to increase crude oil prices (somehow).
2099 2018-10-12 20:02:23 “Oil beef hooked” said fast sounds Irish.
2100 2018-10-12 20:02:19 Well said, but is #AI the engine or the oil refinery ?
2101 2018-10-12 20:02:12 I would strongly advise against that practise. Even in our relatively brief history, evidence has always been on the side of sensible extraction, and replacement. Even with conventional oil, it's an environmental nightmare. (1/2)
2102 2018-10-12 20:02:09 You can search it like peppermint essential oil. It’s quite interesting.
2103 2018-10-12 20:02:05 "this made me do a wheezy oil tycoon laugh"
2104 2018-10-12 20:02:04 Weatherford cut to Sell at Societe Generale in oil services shuffle
2105 2018-10-12 20:01:38 how am i meant to get oil paint out of my hair oh no
2106 2018-10-12 20:01:30 Do you have any recollection of how bathroom oil would be used in the bathroom? So curious about this!
2107 2018-10-12 20:01:23 US economic and political interests go hand in hand. So what’s wrong with the Russian market? First, Putin decided to keep most of the state monopoly on oil and gas. A crime for which many a leader has died. Then,he challenges US’s natural right to decide about oil worldwide
2108 2018-10-12 20:01:13 Ask him what happened to the world running out of oil by 2011. Kind of like climate change today
2109 2018-10-12 20:01:08 don't talk to much about oil, the NSA might hear you >w> !!
2110 2018-10-12 20:01:07 It was this bad. But oil revenue never allowed us reason well. Money was used to sew tongues, and block mouths. Now that our main stay has almost become water, it is a must we look at ourselves critically. Lol
2111 2018-10-12 20:00:56 Ain’t shit slick to a can of oil. Fuck out my face.
2112 2018-10-12 20:00:46 Stir together 8 oz Garlic with 8 oz zucchini. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
2113 2018-10-12 20:00:43 Ma oil barons
2114 2018-10-12 20:00:36 it's well known by now that the only hard work that happens in all of Canada happens within Alberta, on an oil rig.

Everyone else is a Bay street lawyer or an effete university professor.
2115 2018-10-12 20:00:35 Went to get an oil change and as I’m waiting , an old friend pulls up to do the same! West Covina small af. But it was nice catching up with him
2116 2018-10-12 20:00:25 Their constant refrain is ‘mention one project the @MBuhari started and finished in three years’. Please mention any project started or inherited and completed by the PDP from 1999 - 2015 with oil revenue of over $780 billion. Not even a new secondary school!
2117 2018-10-12 20:00:14 As for the price on pollution, currently $30/tonne of which the majority of the revenue is returned to oil producers using output-based subsidies. So Alberta's climate plan actually pays companies to produce more oil.
2118 2018-10-12 20:00:12 これは恋に似てると言うとわりとしっくり来たんですわぁ。
2119 2018-10-12 20:00:11 Making a sandalwood beeswax candle. Trying to master the recipe of coconut oil to beeswax so I can get the best burn from it. Only then can I give them as gifts
2120 2018-10-12 19:59:54 I think those sources are there but they are dagging their feet. My daughter gets free electricity in the evening as excess alternative energy is bled off. She's in Texas. If Texas can do it,anyone can. Oil made Texas rich
2121 2018-10-12 19:59:50 So for wash day I’ll be using: Shea moisture deep treatment mask, coconut oil, Cantu leave in conditioner, Cantu shampoo & conditioner, protein treatment and finally, hair moisturizer from Cantu 
2122 2018-10-12 19:59:49 "saying tunneling beneath the high school could spark a methane explosion at one of the dozens of oil wells on campus."
Subway bad - oil wells on campus no big deal... Um, yeah...
2123 2018-10-12 19:59:47 Do Ecofiscal have a quick graphic of where we can gain the biggest wins - on both a personal and societal level? Flights, mobility, heating, meat, oil & gas extraction, coal power, etc.? Where do we get our biggest bangs for our buck on all levels?
2124 2018-10-12 19:59:39 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
2125 2018-10-12 19:59:34 I hear “kind words butter no parsnips” but I’m sure they they help oil the wheels of friendship. A peaceful weekend to you my Lord 
2126 2018-10-12 19:59:27 I'm not guna lie Clare- I purchased 3 btls of foundation and 2 oil thingy bobs, that ill prob never use 
2127 2018-10-12 19:59:24 These people who think APS will pass any savings or good deals along to their customers are crazy.APS is a profit driven utility, they don't want us to use the sun because they can't make money off of it. Vote YES on 107! Or vote no if you want your power from dirty coal and oil!
2128 2018-10-12 19:59:12 In terms of effort compared to most the others in this lineup, you get a consistent effort from Khaira night in night out
2129 2018-10-12 19:59:11 Alot of people don't know that oil is used in plastic production. People only think oil = cars, planes, trucks etc.
2130 2018-10-12 19:58:59 Why did Black moms give us Cod liver oil everyday like were growing up in industrial-era London?
2131 2018-10-12 19:58:55 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 10/07/18, net long 528,051; change of 20,858 or 3.80% down from prev. 548,909; 71.45% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
2132 2018-10-12 19:58:44 Ms. Slade, I recently made my wife homemade peppermint patties. Delicious (not bacon, but good)! If you make some for the @reason folks, peppermint oil is very strong!
2133 2018-10-12 19:58:43 About that cap... It has exemptions for:
Burning natural gas to generate electricity
Oil production that uses solvents to extract bitumen
The 2 to 5 upgraders Alberta is investing $1B in over 8 years
Any projects deemed to use "enhanced recovery" or "experimental schemes"
2134 2018-10-12 19:58:41 As we know that the oil pushers of the GOP's for huge bribing wealth to these GOP traitors lawmakers of our country$$$$$ vote them out vote blue!!
2135 2018-10-12 19:58:21 “Medical cannabis,” (CBD) is effectively an excellent pain reliever.

CBD + THC Cannabis Oil is the CURE and is illegal. 

Cannabis extracts engage our body’s endocannabinoid system 

Google research
2136 2018-10-12 19:58:17 What kind of oil do you suggest?
2137 2018-10-12 19:58:17 By their oil.  Since the mid-50s its always been about the oil we took for extremely low prices.
2138 2018-10-12 19:58:16 Happy Oil Lamp Day! 
2139 2018-10-12 19:58:02 Colorado Blue Books are missing information about Prop 111 and Prop 112. These are two really important ballot measures that protect folks from payday lending scams and reckless oil and gas activities.
2140 2018-10-12 19:58:01 Someone asked josh how his skin looked so good and when he replied with coconut oil they said he hangs around me too much 
2141 2018-10-12 19:57:32 my data Don finish  baby oil Don full ground.. Ororo Lo ku bayi 
2142 2018-10-12 19:57:26 @LandRover I would like to ask you why your dealership (Landrover™) told us it is impossible to fill up your auto mobile with oil, for there is no "oil fill port". Saying that no one outside of the dealership could do service or even maintenance their own vehicle. Is this true?
2143 2018-10-12 19:57:17 Surely therefore we should conclude that it is better to put money into investment funds that benefit the public (much like labour policy)? rather than wasting it on tax cuts like Thatcher did with north sea oil and Conservatives are doing now with other public assets
2144 2018-10-12 19:57:11 Turbo oil feed is different on a 199a2000 to the 9000 block, need a blanking plate.
2145 2018-10-12 19:57:08 Maybe you should have worked a little harder to get a farm bill passed.  You’ll never again have the power and influence you had last week. All Iowa got was a “promise” from a flip/flopper that we can sell E-15 next summer.  Depending on his oil industry buddies to allow it!
2146 2018-10-12 19:57:00 *oil drips out of my nose*
2147 2018-10-12 19:56:58 Is it an option for the government to purchase railcars and take priority on CP or CN for oil to port? This is a national emergency....the numbers will show up in a year, but the emergency is now!!
2148 2018-10-12 19:56:32 Sir we are getting imported olive oil in KHI. This can be marketed in KHI markets. Huge potential
2149 2018-10-12 19:56:28 You can use avocado in its place, olive oil, cream cheese, hummus, ricotta.  Just don't use margarine, it's all chemicals. Good luck.
2150 2018-10-12 19:56:27 so the planet is dying at an extreme rate and right behind the oil industry, fast fashion is the next most detrimental cause of pollution on the planet. anyway there’s a documentary on netflix called The True Cost that explains this more. this involves you so don’t ignore it
2151 2018-10-12 19:56:25 Enough. Get it built!!! Or continue to import dirty oil from Saudi. Remember them?  The ones who kill people while we turn a blind eye. This is insane and you have 6 months to get this fixed or you will be replaced. #TransMountain #cleanoil
2152 2018-10-12 19:56:06 Coconut oil is honestly the best thing to happen to my hair, 10/10
2153 2018-10-12 19:55:58 Big oil. One 250k contribution from a former Iranian oil CEO.
2154 2018-10-12 19:55:58 His oil is watered down, my diamonds are 100% pure zirconium!

Sorry chap, nothing has changed.  Trump & Kim wound each other up, met, then both went back home claiming victory.  Kim still has his toys and Trump had another photo to spin.

Still, at least you have all that coal!
2155 2018-10-12 19:55:55 The biggest thing to take away from this is that they failed to design the stadium to actually allow airflow when the roof is open. For instance, Lucas Oil stadium has an opening at the either 1 or both end zones. I believe other stadiums have similar designs even Minnesota's.
2156 2018-10-12 19:55:52 @MarinaOLoughlin the olive oil ice cream.... Ok i will stop now.
2157 2018-10-12 19:55:52 No, thermostat settings affect whether inspectors feel like working. (Energy/oil is the cause, the article is about effects.)
2158 2018-10-12 19:55:43 T-shirts not for me, judging by the models. Over the past 50 or so years I've had some liquids injected into me at high pressure, and I have to admit, oil is seeping out. Consequently, no kids sized garments like these in my wardrobe.
2159 2018-10-12 19:55:42  lemon essential oil 
2160 2018-10-12 19:55:37 the Texas company wanted that pipeline expansion so desperately cuz they knew demand for crappy tar sands oil was dropping. Too late, the market has spoken sooner than they thought it would.

We don’t need that pipeline.
2161 2018-10-12 19:55:37 I think they are some of the monoliths behind it and it was done in order to obtain "state of emergency" powers aka national security measures so as to invade oil rich countries
2162 2018-10-12 19:55:33 Competent Jurisdiction Through Criminal Infringement or Criminal Actions of Energy or Telecommunications or Oil & Gas or Transportation or Gas & Mileage With Lack of Fiduciary Competence of Other's Is Criminal Infringement of Other's Due To Civil Loss and Criminal Infringement
2163 2018-10-12 19:55:23 Lmao if you serious some beard oil 
2164 2018-10-12 19:55:18 is it really cheese ?  or an edible oil product ....  inquiring minds need to know ...
2165 2018-10-12 19:54:58 I wouldnt object to weighting the vote say ten English votes being equivalent to one elsewhere. The effects of splintering would affect places like the Falklands most. Oil revenues would be interesting if Islands were independent of Scottish mainland.
2166 2018-10-12 19:54:57 What motor oil are you drinking. Palin's target was directly for that shooting. You can believe that.
2167 2018-10-12 19:54:56 Try roasting pumpkin slices with a little olive oil and salt, let them get browned and caramelized. Brings out a nice sweetness to contrast with the umami of the pumpkin.
2168 2018-10-12 19:54:56 I just want a nice rub down with warm oil & a nap
2169 2018-10-12 19:54:48 WHY DOES OIL DO THE POPPY POP WHEN IN CONTACT WITH MEAT
2170 2018-10-12 19:54:44 No kidding Wrubell.  May as well lather Crisco oil all over the hands of a voodoo doll of Zach Wilson.  #jinx
2171 2018-10-12 19:54:34 'Oil get back to you.
2172 2018-10-12 19:54:34 or try some high potency cannabis oil, "if they let you" geez
2173 2018-10-12 19:54:23 One of these weeks I'm going to sit down and play Factorio properly again. Anyone else out there who habitually mods ore to work like oil so ore stations never get obsolete and the train network just keeps expanding is my patronus
2174 2018-10-12 19:54:20 It's about a mission to rescue American hostages held by militants on an oil rig.
2175 2018-10-12 19:54:11 Las oil sheets de e.l.f sirven para armarse uno si no tenes hojillas. You are welcome.
2176 2018-10-12 19:54:08 Ita fa rayuwar nan haka take in baka ga girman wani ba ba wanda zai ga naka girman.
2177 2018-10-12 19:54:07 Sorry Mags.

Make sure nothings broken, mega dose Omega 3 thru 6 (fish oil Flaxseed oil), elevate.

Superfood shake's & time.
2178 2018-10-12 19:54:03 Oil autocrat + no US ambassador = probably paying off Trump, getting VIP client service.
2179 2018-10-12 19:53:55 Thank God it's perfume oil 
2180 2018-10-12 19:53:22 And; surprise, surprise! you happen to have the only version of the truth

Sorry I'm not into buying snake oil
2181 2018-10-12 19:52:38 Naaa I don't think so
2182 2018-10-12 19:52:35  had stock that gets me to Christmas had no reason to panic buy cooking oil
2183 2018-10-12 19:52:27 The rhetoric from the left is Trump Trump Trump.  Stop with Trump  and talk your issue. Obama care are you serious, outrageous premiums,  Betsy DeVos for real, oil drilling off the coast. Gov Brown approved those permits not the federal government. Vote John Cox California.
2184 2018-10-12 19:52:24 Polar bears should also be dead by now. That fake picture of the polar bear dying because of ice melting was actually just one bear dying of natural causes. In Canada there's a carbon tax (not for long) but the money doesn't actually go to green uses. And we buy dirty oil 
2185 2018-10-12 19:52:24 Anything tht circumvents world order creatrd after ww2, The swift & petro$ is a winner..Indiaz recent move 2buy S-400 & buy iranian oil in INR is one more nail in d coffin of The $! V hav 2dump U.S debt coz $ is no more a reliable currency.russia,china,iran all duming it fast
2186 2018-10-12 19:52:22 When oil companies’ ads are promoted in your anti-oil non-profit’s Twitter feed   #thecorporateworld #extractingprofitfromanywhere
2187 2018-10-12 19:52:01 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
2188 2018-10-12 19:51:57 Fuck the Saudi’s.  Let them choke on their oil.  Everyone is so disgusted by the murder of a journalist in Turkey, I’m still pissed that 15 of them killed over 3,000 Americans on 9/11....they were never held accountable for that atrocity either.  All because of money and oil.
2189 2018-10-12 19:51:55 I love how the GOP who are literally owned by the NRA, big oil, big Pharma, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, Judiciary Crisis Network and the Mercers get all upset and say its unseemly if someone raises more money then them.
2190 2018-10-12 19:51:51 Coconut oil lolz I’m serious
2191 2018-10-12 19:51:45 Why is gas over $3.00 and we lead the world in produced oil?  No wonder nobody can get along in this country!  #exon #GeorgeSoros #crooks
2192 2018-10-12 19:51:43 Who kill them, that's so nice,  chop off their male organs, dice and fry with chilli then chop off their fingers and have them chew on it raw, while you dip their lower body into boiling oil.  When you're done, you can now kill them and feed the rest to 
2193 2018-10-12 19:51:40 @Amara_LW @MadameJeh so...the cannabis oil ecostyler and my hair did not seem to agree and the smell is STRONG 
2194 2018-10-12 19:51:23 Well they say young men don’t want to work I will I’m gonna find me an oil rig and sock that money

2197 2018-10-12 19:51:11 A perfect day picking olives with old and new friends in Abruzzo, complete with a picnic and guided tour of an olive oil milk (frantoio) and an evening stroll in lovely Città Sant’Angelo - today might have been the best day yet on our tour( even though I said that yesterday)!

2199 2018-10-12 19:50:48 Then Accept!!! 
Global warming and climate change caused by humans!!! 
Look... take a pencil and do the math...
+ n x barrels of oil burnt p/a
+ n x tons of coal burnt p/a
+ n x tons of gas burnt p/a
Divided by tons of tree growth p/a
= scary undeniable fact
2200 2018-10-12 19:50:43 Honda beat the incumbent price again $23.85 for an oil change.
2201 2018-10-12 19:50:42 If we all bought Vespa scooters and used them on Fridays... would traffic flow better? Would it be fun? Would it make the oil companies lose money.
2202 2018-10-12 19:50:36 have you tried bio oil

2204 2018-10-12 19:50:21 If you consider belts, spark plugs, and oil changes significant maintenance you’re either terrible at working on cars or have overpaid for that labour. Significant maintainable is engine rebuilds and head gasket replacements. My car has 300,000 km and still has good compression.

2209 2018-10-12 19:49:35 Because you dimwits kept relaying in furnace oil to produce energy, rather use alternative green resources. To guide immediate relief to public but accumulating ambitious debts.
2210 2018-10-12 19:49:16 You know what’s really gonna hurt Albertans? The inevitable demise of the oil and gas industry worsened by the ignorance and unwillingness of all current governments to start ending our dependence on it.

2213 2018-10-12 19:49:08 This man is just saying rubbish, how can he say Nigerian youths are lazy and we are depending on oil money. This one na Buhari person oooo
2214 2018-10-12 19:49:06 @CatherineBizTV other then you thru BNN, will the oil price differential be a top headline!! Eastern Canada does not seem to care!! Thank you!! for bringing it to the forefront!!
2215 2018-10-12 19:48:59 Yes judge Robert Altham has a sister Jane who runs the family business, specialist supplier to offshore oil & gas platforms, 3 owned by centrica who have invested heavily in cuadrilla. Jane wrote a letter to Lancashire CC urging them to back Cuadrilla-that’s what I heard
2216 2018-10-12 19:48:52 Things that have worked in the past for me: Spironolactone to block the androgens chemical exfoliation or retinol for cell turnover  niacinamide & zinc serum for inflammation sunflower sweets serum (contains tea tree oil) from @AYELEANDCO
2217 2018-10-12 19:48:44 Yes. And should be heavily fined bc it is all an oil spill. Plastic is made from petroleum. They can use hemp, corn, banyan tree leaves, etc.

2219 2018-10-12 19:48:32 Yes, very disappointing. I emailed them to ask how they justified it and they said palm oil situation ‘was complicated’. Haven’t bought since.
2220 2018-10-12 19:48:30 The Oil in your head will never run dry...we are voting in a fresh dude. #Nomoreoldcargos
2221 2018-10-12 19:48:26 I don't think there is any need to justify the actions of Saudi, but one must realize US backs this unenlightened country for reasons of realpolitik. To see the state unravel into warring tribes would leave Middle East oil in control of one less friendly country.
2222 2018-10-12 19:48:13 Aberdeen, oil capital of Europe, is getting it's bypass 40years after oil and after election of SNP government.
2223 2018-10-12 19:48:11 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.749 per gallon. 
(Minimum 100 gallons)
2224 2018-10-12 19:48:08 They have lots of money though and oil...... shame you can't understand them or take the time to.....
2225 2018-10-12 19:48:04 Why are you so eager to see this company fail? Are you invested in oil? Do you not believe climate change is a threat?
2226 2018-10-12 19:48:02 It would be remarkable student journalism to dig into how the oil industry, which had the full blessing of your administrators, leaders, and parents, may have misled everyone and left your school property at risk. I would read and promote that story.
2227 2018-10-12 19:47:50 Nobody is jealous of Alberta. AB is boring. We want one thing and only one thing, a winding down of fossil fuel production.  

You are disliked because you can't get that through your head. If it reduces transfer payments no problem. People want an end to oil. Capice?

2232 2018-10-12 19:47:18 Tension that Trump created!

Hell, if you'll buy his snake oil you're my kinda guy.  I like you Jon, I need your help... see, I have exclusive rights to this diamond mine in Namibia, but I need someone with a US account to help me export the diamonds.

All I need is your details!
2233 2018-10-12 19:47:17 Stanley did you really think I meant we can live without olive oil? Come on!
2234 2018-10-12 19:47:16 God will make it easy
2235 2018-10-12 19:47:10 It's not stupidity it's payback for critizing the initial in chief. Remember he hits back 10x harder (in his simple mind) wait until saudis brag about what they did for him so he owes them by keeping price of oil high which aids his boss Vlad.
2236 2018-10-12 19:47:07 Eniku eathuvum concept eliya oil promotion kalm vanthudinka
2237 2018-10-12 19:47:04 For decades the oil industry has operated on your campus with the permission of the school board, which assured everyone the operations are perfectly safe and pose no threat to students.

What changed? Did the oil industry lie about the safety of its operations and equipment?
2238 2018-10-12 19:47:02 All castor oil & coconut cream bruh lol got my shit smooth as hell 
2239 2018-10-12 19:47:01 Yet you can say that all the people driving these cars are making money that we’re not.. doing it for reasons that we aren’t.. taking them to places that we aren’t.. I take mine to work, down I-10 250 miles a week, working to help a lot oil workers actually. Which is crazy ironic
2240 2018-10-12 19:46:55 i can't get past the fact that it's just called the "oil and money conference"
2241 2018-10-12 19:46:33 Did you oil it ?
2242 2018-10-12 19:46:32 I have constant guilt about working in oil&g*s especially with all the climate headlines. Then my student loan takes 980$ and I'm like LOL. (And yes I am continuously applying for other industries)
2243 2018-10-12 19:46:15 Looks to me like she was forced to do the shit

2247 2018-10-12 19:45:49 By having the factory run on solar and wind. It will be hard to get the entire process 100% clean, but then oil production is much worse and ICE engines keep polluting long after they have been produced.
2248 2018-10-12 19:45:44 Yes. Possibly the only thing I remember from said dream. Just to clarify, in said dream, there was such a thing as bathroom oil. It was usually used hot.
2249 2018-10-12 19:45:39 Rick Simpson oil
2250 2018-10-12 19:45:34 Republicans want to burn oil, they want to pay top dollar for lousy health care. They want corporate rule. Why? So the leaders keep America white & fake Christian. 

That's the deal.
2251 2018-10-12 19:45:14 Dry, rough skin can often accompany those leaning towards #Vata tendencies. Daily abhyanga (yes, daily), #ayurvedic massage with Organic Sesame Oil or Moisturizing Herbal Massage Oil, will work wonders to soothe dry skin and tame excess movement.
2252 2018-10-12 19:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2253 2018-10-12 19:45:11 Loasening monetary policy by cutting interest rates at a time of declining oil prices, reduced FX reserves with most of the companies in Nigeria pegging their debt to the , do you know the crisis that might have ensued? I'm not saying your thought is wrong but the circumstances
2254 2018-10-12 19:45:02 Nothing will happen while @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau are running things. She hates oil & he hates Oil & hates the West more. 
2255 2018-10-12 19:44:53 Saudi Arabia has oil. The GOP loves oil and will snivel at the feet of any nation that produces that much of the worlds oil.  There was no WMD in Iraq but there was a -load of oil.
2256 2018-10-12 19:44:46 I NEVER bought the Saudis as our friends...ever since the oil embargo...so TWO HANDS! 
2257 2018-10-12 19:44:35 we have our own versions of dipping hands in hot water and oil in Hinduism.
barbaric justice systems and superstitious belief.
2258 2018-10-12 19:44:28 I’m just confused on how it’s washing your hair though???? Like how is it getting out the dandruff, oil and dirt??
2259 2018-10-12 19:44:22 with a few side roads for Oil Dynasty to drill and create more pollution to rob future generations of ANY garden effect.
2260 2018-10-12 19:44:16 Massive $$$$ & profits still in oil. Alternatives haven’t been ramped up yet.

2264 2018-10-12 19:43:34 Government is funny isn’t it?
They find diamonds or oil in your yard/property it’s the governments.... but if they find weed and other shit it’s yours ....

2266 2018-10-12 19:43:31 One more question cos ur justification is nauseating 2 say d least, how did u expect this govt to have funded the completion of over 200 projects paid for at different levels with d low oil prices? God will damn PDP
2267 2018-10-12 19:43:30 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2268 2018-10-12 19:43:29 my lady uses coconut oil and her hair grows great and long. Lol; totally recommend it.

2271 2018-10-12 19:43:04 Why the fuck shouldn't they. You all use plastic and oil from Saudi. Keyboard warriors
2272 2018-10-12 19:43:03 The thing with Norway is they still have most their oil money under the mattress. They’re prepared to spend a bit of that cash to maintain their distance but have access to the CU and SM. UK gave away all those profits to oil companies years ago and haven’t that much oil left.
2273 2018-10-12 19:43:00 Instead of buying oil from the Saudis ,why don't we invest in clean energy that releases us from dependence on any country. Hurricane Michael caused unbelievable devastation. Hurricane Irma covered the entire state of Florida.
2274 2018-10-12 19:42:49 Hey I get it ok , I’m a vegetarian I like fruits and veggies as much as the next guy, but I’m beyond tired of people thinking they’re shifting realties and shit because they’ve got access to slightly cheaper mangos, blackseed oil, quinoa, and some obscure herbs.
2275 2018-10-12 19:42:44 Yes it sucks! It sends a message to the rest of the world that America has morals until money is involved, then everything is out the window. Went through the same thing with the Bush family and them doing business with Bin Laden family. That was oil 2!
2276 2018-10-12 19:42:43 What's a little oil in the water? It'll separate and besides, it's good for the animals!
2277 2018-10-12 19:42:39 oil pulling but with your mans 
2278 2018-10-12 19:42:36 Yes. They are very similar.  One major difference is 2014 had one clear catalyst: Oil crashing, junk bonds.
2279 2018-10-12 19:42:31 Finally getting an oil change like a decent human being
2280 2018-10-12 19:42:30 Another reason to do what we can to cut down on oil dependence.  It stops the money flowing into the pockets of those who would sponsor terrorism.

2284 2018-10-12 19:42:12 Fish oil supplements should be the first to go.  With the the results from  @AMRN , @FDA_Drug_Info needs to decide in a hurry what they are going to do about the worthlessness of fish oil supplements.
2285 2018-10-12 19:42:11 @aphriainc largest export of cannabis oil 10 wks ago- to Australia’s Medlab  (ASX:MDC), which uses the extracts in human trials to test pain management in cancer patients. 

For the clinical trials, APH provided a high-CBD oil and a high-THC oil specifically designed for Medlab.

2287 2018-10-12 19:41:58 Did Belgium nationalize their rich oil fields into government control?  Bad comparison.
2288 2018-10-12 19:41:57 Is the oil well on campus that was active until a couple of years ago good for the health and safety of the community?
2289 2018-10-12 19:41:56 Taking a break to make food and paint my kitchen! 1000 tokens till oil when I return!

2291 2018-10-12 19:41:38 UN has no mechanism to do that. Even the Paris Accord has absolutely no repercussions for missing targets. Canada could do it though through tariffs. A carbon tariff on imported oil for example would put Alberta on an even playing field, currently investment is fleeing Alberta.

2295 2018-10-12 19:41:22 Ha ha ha - we actually knew it - you don’t have an answer - how could a country rich in oil, gas, coal, techno, energy, food, drink, water etc be better off when it all gets taken off them - doesn’t make a great deal of sense old boy!
2296 2018-10-12 19:41:18 It's time the whole western world wake up and stop doing business with one of the worlds greatest sponsors of terrorism. We cant excuse human rights abuses simply because these assholes have oil
2297 2018-10-12 19:41:16 Where can you get CBD oil from?
2298 2018-10-12 19:41:11 Jr is afraid the Saudis will stop sending oil for his hair.
2299 2018-10-12 19:41:07 Most pain suffering patients can benefit from hemp oil or CBD oil. It does not make you high, it gets more serious medication off the streets. If people could try it, 2ml to 10ml consentration is all one need.CBD oil is for sale in holland in supermarkets, no GP needed.
2300 2018-10-12 19:40:48 Since it's in the water system im going with head gaskets or maybe the oil cooler. It has 46000 km on the clock, it just sucks
2301 2018-10-12 19:40:40 but i have oil so yay
2302 2018-10-12 19:40:39 @tophersimmons:  that's not what i noticed. However, I've realized that 50-year old skin does not **slough** so I combine brown sugar w/coconut oil in a ramekin, take it into shower to scrub forearms, hands etc weekly, then rinse. Soft smoothness follows
2303 2018-10-12 19:40:29 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
2304 2018-10-12 19:40:25 It's the oil and the constant destabilizing of the country. We've tried coup after coup. Also, there is little trust anywhere there.
2305 2018-10-12 19:40:18 And mr doofus gigly cheeks uses his economic expertise to assume he will be out there selling oil after he assumes the pms  throne,travelling to exotic places like siam,persia, yakust,or maybe outer Mongolia with a suitcase full of samples.

2310 2018-10-12 19:40:03 Our society progresses in direct ratio to the availability of cheap and efficient energy. I think everyone would like to move off of oil/coal, but it must be done in a cope & organize method.

Use current resources while developing efficient new energy sources. Natural evolution
2311 2018-10-12 19:39:52 You panicked and bought 2 litres of cooking oil at $12. Did you expect ED to panic and surrender government to a psychatric case ? .
2312 2018-10-12 19:39:50 I consider an accomplishment something good. Opening up Alaska Refuge to oil drilling is just greed, trying to appease oil companies at the cost of ruining environment. Overturning Obama regulations just out of spite ...
not an accomplishment.
2313 2018-10-12 19:39:39 Well, car battery had to finally ne replaced.  But the solace into having dump cash into that and an oil change is that the latter place also has the friendliest cat who sat in my lap while I waited.
2314 2018-10-12 19:39:39 With pay no doubt.
2315 2018-10-12 19:39:35 Best stuff for bug bites is Campho-phenique and mineral oil.  Put on the Campho-phenique and cover with mineral oil.  OTC at drugstores everywhere.  Little green bottle with a yellow label
2316 2018-10-12 19:39:28 There must be oil nearby. But for real, glad to see you're safe.
2317 2018-10-12 19:39:27 I use a mixture I made which consist of coconut oil,biotin and vitamin E.  It works great but I actually use the mixture all over my body after I shower
2318 2018-10-12 19:39:20 شرايكم باخر تعميم للترقيات في الموارد البشريه والتدريب .. ان شاء عاجبكم الوضع والامور تمام بالنسبه لكم ؟!!
2319 2018-10-12 19:39:17 Coconut oil is key to everything
2320 2018-10-12 19:39:14 I did that once to a certain extent. ground up mushroom stems finely, added ground rosemary, garlic and olive oil and made into a paste and added to ground beef for hamburgers and meatloaf. added a neat depth of flavor.
2321 2018-10-12 19:39:10 The east coast of Canada is buying Saudi and Venezuelan oil at 70 bucks/barrel and Alberta is selling it's oil to the Americans at 20! Makes sense @JustinTrudeau. Great decision to kill the East pipeline.
2322 2018-10-12 19:38:42 Trump, Obama, Bush didnt change any regulations with Saudi Arabia after 9/11.  No one in Congress did anything to change regulations either.  US enjoys the oil to much.
2323 2018-10-12 19:38:35 The day I get my oil changed on time will be the day I can finally say I have gotten my life together
2324 2018-10-12 19:38:32 Of course the best forms of oil that humans use for non consumption purposes have been detrimental to the environment (petroleum, whales, etc).
2325 2018-10-12 19:38:31 i have 2 jobs and they are total opposite of each other. 1 i’m dealing with people bitching the whole shift and work with all girls. my 2nd job, i deal with guys changing oil and people that know everything about their car
2326 2018-10-12 19:38:07 I mean, except for a couple false flag chemical attacks in Syria, trafficking ISIS fighters and ISIS oil through Turkey...possibly staging a fake coup against himself just so he could justify exterminating everyone he didn’t like...
2327 2018-10-12 19:37:47 I just read that only 11% of our oil still comes from Saudi Arabia.
2328 2018-10-12 19:37:34 My pool is closed for the winter. I going to buy a few hundred barrels of oil at $16 and just sit on it til Spring.

2333 2018-10-12 19:37:12 @zanupf_patriots They panicked and bought 2litres of cooking oil at $12. Did they expect president ED to panic and surrender government to a psychatric case..
2334 2018-10-12 19:37:05 Growing up, all our cats were indoor/outdoor, so nails and hairballs weren't on my radar. The mineral oil works like a champ. My current cat is a polydactyl, so nail clipping is not optional. They grow into her pads if not cut.

2336 2018-10-12 19:37:00 But you did say humans can live without oil and have for 99.9% of their history. Since the invention of the wheel (or even the roller) humans have needed some form of oil for longer than 99.9% of our history.
2337 2018-10-12 19:36:51 note: I mean this was not a one time prediction. He would make the same prediction every year... $200 Oil soon!

2339 2018-10-12 19:36:32 almost ordered mushrooms on toast @thekoffeepot today, they add truffle oil to theirs
2340 2018-10-12 19:36:29 Of course not, but the beast had to be fed it’s oil or it would turn on him. Scary thought.
2341 2018-10-12 19:36:28 I will marry whoever invented clove oil know dis
2342 2018-10-12 19:35:58 Hate to tell you this, but news has been reporting we could see oil prices skyrocket in November, and of course Trump's #tradewar has already reportedly increased prices enough to have wiped out the tax cut most average Americans will receive. But hey, wages are flat!

2347 2018-10-12 19:35:35 @leslietfj either rich or poor no in between. U need to travel to Venezuela a oil rich country under socialism which 2 million have fled. Your party's ideology would in time destroy our country and embolden our enemies to possibly invade us because of open borders and slashing
2348 2018-10-12 19:35:33 Time to set tariffs on all 3rd world oil imports.

2350 2018-10-12 19:35:21 So went to deliver oil for my father's generator, and they locked themselves out of their house. So yeah, that's how today is going.
2351 2018-10-12 19:35:12 Could really go for some oil right now
2352 2018-10-12 19:35:06 Except the only prize your oil barons actually want.
2353 2018-10-12 19:35:04 It’s not cold and tingly enough for me, I might add more mint oil to the bottle. I WANT TO BE SHIVERING WITH MINTY REFRESHMENT
2354 2018-10-12 19:35:02 So I’ve recently established a self goal of forcing myself out of my comfort zone.

So far, I’ve cut my hair shorter than usual and my Amazon order history is filled with oil diffusers and protein powder. #yolo #doyouevenselfcarebro #GAINZ #nodaysoff #yolo #beastmode #suckmyaura
2355 2018-10-12 19:34:54 Mate viessmann have been doing oil for many many years, I am guessing 30-40 years! I have 20 year old ones on my books. They leave behind the excuse of an oil boiler brands that are marketed heavily here
2356 2018-10-12 19:34:47 Plus the state capture by the Guptas, #Steinhoff scam, Oil stock reserves sold 27% unemployment and all time petrol high.
2357 2018-10-12 19:34:47 Saudi Arabia should be bombed out of existence. Most evil nation on the Planet .. I blame the British - they showed them where all the fucking oil was.

2358 2018-10-12 19:34:33 Yeah, and I also had almost the same thing but instead if mushrooms it had oil cured tomatoes. So, you know
2359 2018-10-12 19:34:25 Reminds me of Richard "Peak Oil" Heinberg who, starting in the mid 90s, would predict $200 a barrel oil... One of these years he may be right. 
2360 2018-10-12 19:34:21 We are also the 4th largest oil producing country in the world.
2361 2018-10-12 19:34:21 That’s exactly why I love them. The sunflower oil does it for me. They don’t event need ketchup.
2362 2018-10-12 19:34:17   I guess the treatment is the same as for vaseline — baby oil, then wash with fairy liquid, then multiple shampoo washes
2363 2018-10-12 19:34:12 I love October, cause I can get away with smelling like baby oil, pumpkin spice AND sex at the same time

2366 2018-10-12 19:34:03 Going organic with your skincare? Try clove oil on pimples. Dries them right up.

2370 2018-10-12 19:33:43 Yes! We could launch a reclamation boom by putting oil and gas workers to work cleaning up the liabilities of the industry and phasing out production. We need to get these companies to clean up their messes while we still can!

2373 2018-10-12 19:33:38 If people really believed in global warming  they would halt all operations that require oil like flying and driving a car. All of them seem to be all talk thought
2374 2018-10-12 19:33:20 My wife tried this recently and I got curious. It works by pulling the oil out of your hair. People used to do this with corn starch. It's the same thing. It's also SUPER bad for your hair in the long run and can cause hair lose because lack of bathing iritates the scalp.
2375 2018-10-12 19:33:17 Money managers have cut their bullish Brent and WTI oil bets by 46,367 combined net-long positions to 784,302, weekly ICE Futures Europe and CFTC futures and options data on four contracts show.

2376 2018-10-12 19:33:04 Norways oil resources are a terrible comparison as they had shared access with UK to the north sea oil reserves. Norway invested their money in a public oil fund which now tops $1 trillion - they use this to pay their pensions among other things. Ours was blown on tax cuts!

2380 2018-10-12 19:32:50 I mean, OF COURSE you'll get rich if you got dashed an oil block.
2381 2018-10-12 19:32:46 Yes, the common thread .. All countries screwed over by the UK and US since the western war machine’s demand for oil grew.
2382 2018-10-12 19:32:45 No, I really don't have any oil shares.  TSX 30% below DJIA (due to Trudeau policies).  Real scientists challenge their findings.  No funding for that.

2384 2018-10-12 19:32:23 yeah a lot of people don't realize that the LA basin is still a major oil-producing region and you can turn random corners in quaint neighborhoods to find lovely, art-covered oil derricks pumping away

2427 2018-10-12 19:26:49 Actually, the bit about the Arctic shipping lanes is close to the truth. Rising global temperatures, while wreaking havoc on human subsistence all over the world, would keep the Arctic ice-free year-round and open up drilling and trade passages for Russian and U.S. oil interests.

All because we decided to raise oil prices.
2439 2018-10-12 19:25:58 Venezuela stopped private ownership & implemented a state owned economic system (EFF model). If Venezuela, a country with the largest oil reserves on the planet could not make Socialism work, then there's no hope for ANC & EFF. Economic illiteracy is why people became Communists.

I have a health condition that i deal with nausea and vomiting 24/7!  Also peppermint on your wrists help!  Best wishes for a great pregnancy!!!
2472 2018-10-12 19:24:02 From a historical standpoint, not entirely true. Prior to petroleum, the whaling industry operated on a large scale for centuries to supply oil.  Also olive oil for non-food applications for millennia as well. Humans have utilized some form of “oil” for a long long time.

2482 2018-10-12 19:23:13 Even if you don’t believe in climate change, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, creating American jobs, upgrading American infrastructure and expanding American technological advances are huge reasons to support Tesla.
2483 2018-10-12 19:23:10 Pleaseee naman sana oil
2484 2018-10-12 19:23:09 Where has the question of veg or non-veg been raised here. Godess Durga doesn't serve food & oil on behalf of fortune food. There are better ways to market things.
2485 2018-10-12 19:22:41 Actually Rick Simpson oil has been shown to neutralize cancer cells in various studies
2486 2018-10-12 19:22:39 I put it in boiling water for about eight minutes then drain it, only add olive oil for lasagna so the noodles don't stick together

2489 2018-10-12 19:22:24 I think you've got Cardinal and Red Storm Rising mixed up.

The guy in Cardinal is a former college professor who's out for revenge because the Soviets killed his family.

In RSR, Muslim separatists blow up the Soviets' main oil refinery, kicking off WWIII.
2490 2018-10-12 19:22:18 I'm trying to say I'm not anti-science but that there is governments that are evil who used doctors and science to try and murder people and suppress information for profit.  Oil companies suppressing facts about global warming.
2491 2018-10-12 19:22:18 It will for a day or two. Good luck mate and don't forget to use olive oil.
2492 2018-10-12 19:22:15 I am saying charging cars and trucks at service stations does not work at scale. It simply doesnt. Hence bp will be far better off building hrs. Automakers and big oil use bev as means to procrastinate. It is compromised. Sorry, if you feel different welcome to stop following

2497 2018-10-12 19:21:39 You are spewing misinformation here. I’m sure you’re smart enough to know Trudeau has no influence on the price of oil and that energy is a private business sector in Canada. You’re just trying to get a rise out of uneducated voters so they don’t vote lib. Shameful
2498 2018-10-12 19:21:38 Ode Buruku!

2499 2018-10-12 19:21:35 Over friends and family, no increase in wages either! I live not I love in the sticks! I live in a very cold climate in the winter and it's going to be $$$$$$ to heat my home with oil!
2500 2018-10-12 19:21:25 Imma get the lyrics on a double cup of that oil
2501 2018-10-12 19:21:24 We could look at your state and the amount of government welfare corporations receive, like oil, rural and agricultural subsidies, or stolen land through Jim Crow terrorism and Mexican repatriation.  But YOU actually don’t want to look at the big picture. Do you?

2505 2018-10-12 19:21:10 Just watched a YouTube clip where Gordon Ramsay said that you should add oil to your cooking water to stop pasta sticking together and now I have to move him to the TV Chefs Who Don't Know What They're Talking About column.
2506 2018-10-12 19:21:04 I have a slow cooker, mostly I make soup, so easy. 

I love pasta; 
Boil some pasta, sauté onions, garlic, zucchini, peppers & mushrooms. Basil, Olive oil & Parmesan,  Season to taste, and Bobs yer Uncle.
2507 2018-10-12 19:20:53 I will be here. I just realized- 2010 is when they started waging against #FreeSpeech, right? @kimstrassel said Jan 2010? Gulf Oil Spill Apr

2511 2018-10-12 19:20:37 Yeah those lithium minesites triple the size of an oil field is really doing a great job. Look why not figure out something that isn't harmful in any way. I usually have respect for you but this post is a blatant lie.
2512 2018-10-12 19:20:34 Local contractors need wealth management knowhow in order to manage the sudden rags-to-riches euphoria due to oil business opportunities in Turkana East.
2513 2018-10-12 19:20:27 So, petroleum or oil, and coal, related to essentially all of them!  So, we need to, when we can install solar panels on our house, unless you live on a farm and have space for a wind turbine, and we need to buy at least hybrid, preferably electric cars!  Ok, then, let's be about

2515 2018-10-12 19:20:17 Lot of olive cultivation has started recently in Chakwal and potohar region. You'll soon find this from Punjab also. I'd be interested in trying the olive oil from Balochistan.

Where is vegetable oil?
It’s a diesel-type fuel for Diesel engines and can be #CO2neutral.

And how much does it cost the provider to get such a label?

Is it affordable for small businesses or it it again one of the big business schemes of the EU?
2520 2018-10-12 19:20:05 I’m naked and wet! And I smell of..... hang on... “Argan oil”. Really? Ok.
2521 2018-10-12 19:20:01 Change the world? I can't even find time to change my oil.
2522 2018-10-12 19:19:57 … away from the oil company
2523 2018-10-12 19:19:56 All because of oil. They have nothing else. Even they call a stretch of their country "the empty quarter". They create nothing. They have no other influence. 1 in 4 residents are imported foreign laborers whom they constantly abuse.
Just  *one* of the several major oil supplies.
2524 2018-10-12 19:19:54 We need to produce more Canadian products so that countries will look to us a a basic resource for more than just oil and minerals

2527 2018-10-12 19:19:31 Who selling snake oil? The only time I ever heard of Cannabinoids killing Cancer cells was when NIDA approved studies that concluded it and the US Government patented said cannabinoids. Also, we are not the ones stigmatizing patients.
2528 2018-10-12 19:19:30 can we turn journalists into oil? I feel like there's an untapped opportunity here

2534 2018-10-12 19:19:09 No, definitely not.

I mean to say 17 years of war propaganda demonising Muslims so people ignore the horrors being inflicted upon all in lands of oil.  Is the problem. Takes a great effort to turn 180. @SenSanders is anti war & would want him to support a Womens National Strike.

2555 2018-10-12 19:17:08 Oil and gas creates 26% of Canada's GHGs. Transportation is next up at 24%. Straight from the government.
2556 2018-10-12 19:17:07 Happens here all the time at the end of summer, beginning of fall. All the oil build up suddenly gets wet, and people never think about it - until they slam on their brakes, and whoops! No friction!
2557 2018-10-12 19:17:04 But to your point: nope. Turkey doesn’t have enough money to buy shit and so its free pass will extend to approximately Tuesday afternoon. Then the next crisis (either Syrian Kurds or Iranian oil) will blow up aggressively.
2558 2018-10-12 19:17:04 So basically anyone can be killed to serve Saudi interests as the US need a paltry 100bn in contracts. They should just take the oil.
2559 2018-10-12 19:17:01 oh wow so baby oil gets it poppin?
2560 2018-10-12 19:16:49 Not only that,  but we actually subsidize big oil with our tax dollars! It's not like they are in danger of going out of business... especially with year after year of record breaking profits! We have to stop dark money from influencing legislation that is only self serving.
2561 2018-10-12 19:16:45 Non-edible vegetables subproducts are the parts of the plants produced mainly for people that we cannot digest: wheat straw, corn stalks, potato peels are just a few examples. 85% of global soybeans are processed as oil for cooking. What is left is used as animal feed
2562 2018-10-12 19:16:42 How much non upgraded bitumen (heavy oilsands oil) do you think accounts for our oil exports as a whole?
2563 2018-10-12 19:16:31 Sorry. Oil not all
2564 2018-10-12 19:16:30 On the other hand we are seeing increased sales of heavy oil to China...and they need a lot of heavy oil for infrastructure projects etc. It isn’t all the bad news.
2565 2018-10-12 19:16:29 This reminds me of an oil painting i love it

2567 2018-10-12 19:16:19 Honestly, with the Saudi deal to sell oil in US dollars, and the Saudi purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons, the US #1 export, what "significant steps" do you expect Trump and a bought Congress to take over a murdered US journalist?

2570 2018-10-12 19:16:15 Our media outlets should report the price of a barrel of oil each day, the WTI price, and the WCS price listed side by side.  The delta between the two is lost revenue, taxes, investment, jobs, opportunity and hope - all because of Trudeau's ideology/policy.

2574 2018-10-12 19:16:02 @Snyders_Hanover love your snacks but why do you use palm oil? #saveorangutans
2575 2018-10-12 19:15:56 In my view, the single upside is that we no longer use whale oil in foods. But in most other respects the increase in palm oil production this past generation has caused a wholesale destruction of habitat.
2576 2018-10-12 19:15:49 It’s more that instead of building roads with our infrastucture budget, the government would gradually move towards electric rail and subsidizing oil companies and coal companies so they can switch to producing renewables.

2579 2018-10-12 19:15:29 In 1974, Officials confirm discovery of important new oil deposits up to 20 million barrels, near the Gulf of Mexico.
2580 2018-10-12 19:15:22 Actually we have a reciprocal agreement with the Saudis. They buy arms from us we buy oil from them. 

So far the arms deal for $1B has not happened but we have bought $10B, yes $10B worth of all from them.
2581 2018-10-12 19:15:21 Man I had no idea Justin Trudeau personally sold oil to the US, who had that job for the decades upon decades prior to him kicking your party out of office? Also, please stop lying all the time? #WeakAndy #CPCLies #JustNotReady #cdnpoli

2584 2018-10-12 19:15:06 Oil. Arms.
2585 2018-10-12 19:14:55 @RobWittman I love how you people give Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt of an obvious murder because of their oil, but Iran gets nothing ever in benefit of the doubt. Shows the stupidity of you and your party. Money is more important than anything. Including common sense.

2590 2018-10-12 19:14:34 When did he get married? I remember a new year's eve not too long ago with him bumbling drunk on air talking about being ready to mingle. Before he almost pierced his nipples. That nationally televised train wreck.
2591 2018-10-12 19:14:34 Not managing to process this ... palm oil is derived from the fruit or nut. Organic or non, to establish the trees any other forest must be cleared out. It's a mono-culture crop and very little can live around it, hence the biodiversity loss.
2592 2018-10-12 19:14:27 I’ve never had Bulletproof but I love adding coconut oil to my coffee! But this weekend I’m working with this guy that’s friends with Dave Asprey and I was trying to tell my roommates and family about and no one knew who he was! I’m like I thought he was a household name?? Lol
2593 2018-10-12 19:14:23 If the area where the oil derrick was located was not on the edge of the campus then the risk would be much higher. That might be why. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the size of the campus but it rivals most city colleges.
2594 2018-10-12 19:14:13 Someone release Don Lemon's yearbook. We need answers as to why he is the way that he is.

2610 2018-10-12 19:12:30 $1500 for PARKING!!!! Does it include a new paint job, interior repair, oil change, new tires and wax?
2611 2018-10-12 19:12:20 So, I think it's a matter of trusting your reader to have (or be able to find) some skills. A cookbook doesn't (generally) tell you how to turn on your stove or how to use a knife or how to peel garlic or where to buy olive oil. They tell you to sauté minced garlic in olive oil.

2614 2018-10-12 19:11:58 If only there was some sort of conveyance thingamajig, like a giant buried pipe of some sort, that might transport this oil safely and easily to world markets (or mebbe even Eastern Canada)

2616 2018-10-12 19:11:43 It’s going to be @JohnstonesTrade eggshell. Oil based. Sheen level on that is perfect but if it’s anything like the wb its good for pretty much any top coat I’ve tried
2617 2018-10-12 19:11:23 This is what we miss by not following Breitbart or FoxNews or that guy on the bus who mumbles and pisses himself and smells like motor oil and bleach.

No one saw a flare or a tanker...  
The RNS dosent quote a time or a quantity.
No one reported oil smells.

I would be please to see some more detail. Other than the headline flow rate.
2620 2018-10-12 19:11:10 Speaking of system-side changes, the entire built environment of the US will have to change *a lot.* The suburban development model was built entirely around cheap oil.
2621 2018-10-12 19:11:10 Ramen, a sliced ham, beef -- those little extra cooking oil.
2622 2018-10-12 19:10:58 I don't see a problem using subsidies to jumpstart a business that will actually do some good. Oil industry, other car manufacturers who actually claimed "electric cars cannot be made practically" OR "its pointless to make electric cars" are causing more harm with subsidies
2623 2018-10-12 19:10:46 How can they finish projects when their budgetary allocations are always very low and actual releases are looted by contractors who are most of the time their cronies and fronts.

Lest you forget, they earned  nearly $390billion in oil revenue during this period.

2625 2018-10-12 19:10:36 None of these are actual problems.. they are warnings that the RV batteries could be a problem if they aren’t handled the way they ARE going to be handled.. so I don’t see what your facts are except fear.. do want oil and gas spill facts to compare??
2626 2018-10-12 19:10:29 @realDonaldTrump You can stop it but must to actuate now.

1.-Using Emergency Oil Supplies to plunges world wide oil's prices. This will bring consecuences to Venezuelan & Iranian regimen

2.-Replacing FED Chief Jerome Powell & senior positions insiste FED by true fully nominees

2629 2018-10-12 19:10:16 I don't have oily skin but I use the Catrice Prime and Fine Pore Refining Anti-Shine Base for its mattifying & long lasting properties.
A good tip for oily skin is to prime -> setting powder -> foundation -> setting powder to reduce and control the oil/shine
2630 2018-10-12 19:10:06 I havent tried the oil, but i do have edibles to have to help me sleep. My doctor is supposed to finish off my prescription at my next office appt (ive been seeing him in a different department for injections). He wants me to have something balanced around 5% each lol

2634 2018-10-12 19:09:45 Please look at this.  Beto raised this money from individuals.  Ted Cruz’s $ comes from the oil & gas industry, Koch brothers, Mercer, JW Childs, and law firms.  All big money and corporations.  Beto will be working for the people of TX not corporations like Cruz.  Vote Beto!
2635 2018-10-12 19:09:45 I am curious as to how much energy production and wealth is actually generated in Calgary.  I don't see any oil sands within the city limits.  Offices are not wealth generators or energy producers.
2636 2018-10-12 19:09:38 If there are people being paid by billionaires to spread pro-fossil fuel anti-science propaganda specifically to keep the oil industry safe at the expense of the planet and its inhabitants then maybe don't legitimize their propapaganda by inviting them to debate at @Politicon

2642 2018-10-12 19:09:27 Funding a $550 mill war in Yemen doesn't come cheap, Baby prince needs cash & Trump needs a mid term win & Turks need the Iraqi oil flow. Publicising an assassination is just how business is done these days.

2644 2018-10-12 19:09:15 Aye. You should do a dry run. It’s a lovely Sunday dinner. For the veg I just toss them in olive oil, honey, and whole grain mustard.

2649 2018-10-12 19:08:32 Ooohh boy. You’ve just zoomed in on a major family story: Around 1905-1910 my greatgrandfather was dissuaded from buying a large part of the coastline in Long Beach California. He had a hunch oil was there. His son in law, my grandfather, told him not to. We’re still in mourning
2650 2018-10-12 19:08:31 Dude I studied cancer for years, this is snake oil. Google is not a research degree. People are looking into it, but to say it's a cure is a lie. 
Read that article, from qualified people who understand research. This shit is dangerous.
2651 2018-10-12 19:08:09 @realDonaldTrump FED & International Co-Conspirator like China the US major public debt owner, Saudi Arab with high oil prices among other are inducing a global economic crise for political bias to Undermine your presidency & blame you for all this atrificial mess created by them

2661 2018-10-12 19:07:38 If NL stops oil production, companies downstream will just switch to a new oil provider, while emissions will fall slightly as some people (particularly us) become too poor to heat our homes or buy gasoline.

2665 2018-10-12 19:07:31 Just a thought... maybe we should start worrying about putting our $$ into what comes after oil? These problems aren’t going away over night. Just continuing to bet on an aging horse seems pretty dumb by most perspectives, no?

2667 2018-10-12 19:07:23 Ok several things.
1. Scientists didn't think the earth was flat dirt farming peasants thought that.
2. Oil is made up of mostly dead plants. Plants only use certain isotopes of carbon because it is easier for them to metastasize. If  rising carbon levels were not man made

2669 2018-10-12 19:07:17 So it's the boiler themselves that weather compensate not mixed heating circuits? I'm only familiar with comp circuits for oil didn't even know there was a way of comping the boiler do they use a internal store/buffer to pump from to achieve the modulation? This is cool stuff 
2670 2018-10-12 19:07:15 Since the area is so obviously toxic to the students, how about BH move the HS to another location? All those abandoned oil wells and methane gas pockets sound like a real risk.
2671 2018-10-12 19:07:14 My tire sensor is ALWAYS on. So annoying. My mechanic turns it off for me when I take it in for an oil change

2674 2018-10-12 19:07:13 Your funny, one how do you know they haven’t already taken the oil, secondly do you not know how tests are conducted? Very silly, you should do with all that’s going on at ukog.
2675 2018-10-12 19:07:10 Doesn’t look such a dreadful idea now. Oil or no oil.
2676 2018-10-12 19:07:00 make sure to get the "flavoured" olive oil...
2677 2018-10-12 19:06:55 Q: You have a barrel of oil, and you need to measure out just one gallon. How do you do this if you only have a three-gallon container and a five-gallon container?
2678 2018-10-12 19:06:22 My coconut oil is 100% liquid summer is  upon us
2679 2018-10-12 19:06:20 U.S. Rig Count is up 11 rigs from last week to 1,063, with oil rigs up 8 to 869, gas rigs up 4 to 193, and miscellaneous rigs down 1 to 1.
2680 2018-10-12 19:06:05 Canadian oil prices are collapsing.
Now a $50/barrel differential for WCS.
Pass the bong there people.
2681 2018-10-12 19:05:50 System-side changes could range from reformist things like taxes on certain fuels (like coal and oil) and items (like beef and single-use plastic bags), to more drastic things like banning coal power generation.

2687 2018-10-12 19:05:22 The truth if the matter is that every facet of #Nigeria need an intervention or emergency, so even if the $60 billion uncollected loyalty from the oil companies are anything to go buy, will channelling it to paying minimum wages the way to go
2688 2018-10-12 19:05:20 Jesus Christ. Enough with your snake oil pseudoscience gibberish.
2689 2018-10-12 19:05:20 Hate them. Will cook olive oil.
2690 2018-10-12 19:05:11 Why don't you start your keyboard activism against all the oil billionaires who are playing Russian roulette with climate? Why do you have to start with someone who's trying to help?
2691 2018-10-12 19:05:04 Well I guess sending them armoured vehicles and continuing to buy oil from them? You're stuck in him bringing up human rights, but you're missing the fact that we will always trade with them no matter what. Always have and always will.
2692 2018-10-12 19:05:00 People whose oil stank will always try to contaminate those who are pure! #StayFresh
2693 2018-10-12 19:05:00 Shanghai has successfully built a #recycling system in which waste cooking #oil, or “gutter oil”, are collected before turned into #biodiesel that is sold at 40 gas stations.
2694 2018-10-12 19:05:00 Yo se que todo cuesta, pero el gas oil anda x 35, el malo.
No quieren pagar ni el combustible que se gasta en ser transportado. Ni medio litro de gas oil!
2695 2018-10-12 19:04:55 Surly sucking millions of gallons of oil out of the Earth is linked to earthquakes.   This is farcical.
2696 2018-10-12 19:04:39 It`s madness to give another country 92% of your huge oil and gas wealth to run it for you.
Westminster sees no voters as weak,they sent their taxman to Glasgow to test loyalty and laughed.
Westminster is not what it used to be,look how scot`s are treated
2697 2018-10-12 19:04:32 Why the fuck must EVERYTHING be drizzled with oil ??? Pretentious bollocks xx

2704 2018-10-12 19:04:00 The Saudi royal kingdom has been messing with the US at least since the oil price shocks in the 70s. We should not favor them over Iran in their religious disputes but should be an honest peace maker with both at the table.
2705 2018-10-12 19:03:58 I know how we can pay for it. We should invade and take down the fanatical Saudi monarchy, then take half of their oil, and give the other half to their people.
2706 2018-10-12 19:03:53 how can oil companies and big corporations care more about money than the earth when like, if we kill the earth your money means nothing because we’ll all be dead!
2707 2018-10-12 19:03:48 Actually he quoted the figures wrong again. The deals were around 4bill only. Kushner was counting on baby prince to take the throne for further cash inflow, for now this is just about the midterms & oil prices.

2711 2018-10-12 19:03:16 You think big oil cares about climate change... if more industries rise with the concept of clean energy they could become targets n big oil could start taking them out like Don corleone
2712 2018-10-12 19:03:13 Aren't you glad Trump has made us less dependent on Saudi Arabia oil by drilling more at home?
2713 2018-10-12 19:03:06 But the issue is the lack of pipelines to send heavy oil anywhere else when refineries shut down. Of course the lighter stuff isn’t seeing the massive discounts right now. I don’t think you are really disproving his point. Also, a large percentage of CDN oil is the heavy stuff.
2714 2018-10-12 19:03:06 Oh, HELL no...
2715 2018-10-12 19:03:00 かわいいいいっ

2722 2018-10-12 19:02:21 This is the best you have for this argument? That the coastguard themselves were dumping batteries? And this has WHAT to do with the use of batteries in EVs?? Do you want to see all the oil and natural gas spills and leaks compared to this preposterous comparison?

2727 2018-10-12 19:01:57 Yes because 1 it’s not an animal product, 2. it’s the highest yeild. 3. Unless you are oil free you’re the biggest hypocrite. All oils cause damage to animal habitats, it’s just the palm oil have the “cutest” cover animal. Do more research before coming at palm oil lol

2743 2018-10-12 19:00:12 We can’t build new pipelines to new markets (eg Asia). So basically all this stuff gets sent to the gulf (who have refineries that can handle heavy Canadian oil). Some of those refineries are now offline, so no demand for Canadian oil right now.

2745 2018-10-12 18:59:53 By September the Wehrmacht were less than 100 miles from Moscow. The major reason they lost apart from hubris was extremely thin stretched supply line vulnerable to Russian counterattacks. They could never win caucus oil fields.

2747 2018-10-12 18:59:49 They are the ally of everyone who wants to keep the world dependent on oil. That’s why Bush held hands. The extraction interests are determined to rape and rule the planet.
2748 2018-10-12 18:59:46 I have made a neural network that makes neural network. How deep can this get. How long till one of my neural network discovers oil inside itself.
2749 2018-10-12 18:59:45 On top of that I was getting an oil change tire rotation and wheel alignment
2750 2018-10-12 18:59:45 What about me that like water and olive oil....since you want to be petty

2752 2018-10-12 18:59:39 Lol  , you are beyond logic. Every country in the world uses oil but that doesn't mean that we have to invade other countries on the pretext of weapons of mass destruction and steal their oil
2753 2018-10-12 18:59:28 It will take voting out politicians owned by oil

2755 2018-10-12 18:59:22 Just like,, oil and heat the pan... Then cook the egg... Eat it...
2756 2018-10-12 18:59:13 I believe millions of people are led/brainwashed into eating a heavily processed, high carb, high seed oil diet, because such pyramids/guidelines allow Cheerios and Mazola to be marketed as healthy, and for beef to be demonised
2757 2018-10-12 18:58:36 Big oil and auto have received billions in direct  subsidies and claim to be pursuing green policies. That's real hypocrisy for you. I assume you're tweeting the Koch brothers to check on how they're spending their money?
2758 2018-10-12 18:58:33 Ну, аниме — это слишком много времени, и часто аниме оч сильно обрезают и цензурят много чего, что было в манге, как с Токийским Гулём, например, или Шаман Кингом было

2760 2018-10-12 18:58:05 Treachery? Seriously? More like facing the reality Trudeau has completely buggered things up!
Not attacking the old economy? Take a trip to Alberta where Notley and Trudeau have destroyed Alberta's oil industry and we now suffer a $50/ barrel discount to WTI pricing
2761 2018-10-12 18:58:01 Whenever I get an oil change all I can think is "wow, I am one responsible son of a b"
2762 2018-10-12 18:57:54 No. Worse would be weaponizing the human genome and targeting a deadly virus that only affect persons of ME descent to get them off the top of the oil.
2763 2018-10-12 18:57:40 Ok it's been two hours and I have not been called or talked to by the workers here. It should not take this long to fix a light and do the oil. Unless those take longer than I thought
2764 2018-10-12 18:57:31 He says Germany relies too much on foreign oil!  We rely on the war machine money!
2765 2018-10-12 18:57:30 Arms and oil, that’s all it’s ever been. Not just the US but the UK too. Saudi know their strong position so will continue to get away with atrocities on their own soil and abroad.
2766 2018-10-12 18:57:29 I’m sure the big oil moguls are behind whatever is going on. Very few corporates are at the top.
2767 2018-10-12 18:57:12 First Hatch and now this. 
2768 2018-10-12 18:57:12 Don’t feel like sitting waiting on a damn oil change 
2769 2018-10-12 18:57:10 Alors sachez ce sont des véhicules ultra sécurisés, ils ont le anti-collision, d’autres sécurité en tout genre... Alors dire que c’est un véhicule dangereux ça serait dire que toutes les voitures sont dangereuses et que ont devrait plus les utiliser, c’est un non sens.

2771 2018-10-12 18:57:00 Look up in the sky, it’s Chore Man! Watch as he cleans the house, goes grocery shopping, and gets the oil changed in his car! It’s Chore Man, putting the “sexy” in “responsibility.”

(Respon-sexy-ility? OK, maybe Chore Man didn’t think that one all the way through)
2772 2018-10-12 18:56:57 @talkRADIO @georgegalloway I thought Tamar was a one off. Welcome bck. Vis-a-vis the '73 oil crisis, it had a positive impact on emissions btw, considering he brought up climate chg. Many yanks traded those fintailed jalopies, for more economic european models.Shame we lost rover
2773 2018-10-12 18:56:52 Mmm smell that sweet, sweet burning oil 
2774 2018-10-12 18:56:46 Lol. The oil can fry 4 eggs
2775 2018-10-12 18:56:38 Yenyenyen... She just binned an outlet of getting daily free oil to try plaintain 
2776 2018-10-12 18:56:36 The only oil Canada should be producing is: #CannabisOil

2777 2018-10-12 18:56:29 Yes @Oommen_Chandy who was involved in Palm oil, Titanium and solar scams should have a say in this matter.... It amazes to see people wanted for corruption raise fingers on others as if they are epitones of honesty.
2778 2018-10-12 18:56:12 I always ask if they fry their fries in the same oil as animal products before ordering!!
2779 2018-10-12 18:56:10 Trying so hard not to go grab a donut while i wait for my oil change lol
2780 2018-10-12 18:56:10 The fact that this happened abroad is even more disconcerting. Abuses within a sovereign nation are wrong but allowing it to happen abroad sets a dangerous precedent. China ought to be called out for it's forced repatriation of Nationals living abroad.

2783 2018-10-12 18:56:05 9/11? Sorry but the Saudi leaders have led an oppressive, dictatorial, hypocritical, and immoral regime for hundreds of years. The US got in bed with them in the 1930's based on our lust for oil. This shit's been going down long before 9/11.

2791 2018-10-12 18:55:31 That we’ve been treating them like allies (D and R administrations both) is disgusting. We don’t need their oil or money that much.
2792 2018-10-12 18:55:19 the saudis chop people up, stone women and all that but we are like "hey cool guys, thanks for all the oil, keep buying all those weapons from us"
2793 2018-10-12 18:55:17 Well I’ve been watching SA for a while and knew that if what I was seeing was true, MBS forced to sell oil in gold back yuan to their largest customer China, then some kind of “regime change” propaganda was coming or something to justify removing MBS.

And we've things to cover,
Truth is a long way to go,
But we will survive,
We'll archive,

2797 2018-10-12 18:54:49 I think u really need to read the historical background and ownership of forte oil. From British Petroleum(BP) to Forte Oil.

Google is your friend
2798 2018-10-12 18:54:41 Why does Congress still have ObamaCare but it's not offered to the rest of us?  Why does Congress get pay raises but average Americans do not? Time for the people to elect those who work for the people and not big corporations, big oil, banks, big pharm, and the top 1%
2799 2018-10-12 18:54:34 If appears as if it's all about the tax $$ to me.  Why else tax patients?  The new CRA excise tax, along with HST patients will be hit with up to $80 tax on a $200 bottle of oil.  That is 40% tax for a medical patient.  How can that be rationalized?  Heartbreaking for patients...
2800 2018-10-12 18:54:27 Me to proud of her no one Has received more cash as Bill and Hillary Mark Rich played for pardon he made his money by selling oil to Iran when there was embargo oh ya after 154billion to Iran like 330 million back to foundation on and on.And proud she ruined Monica life.

2802 2018-10-12 18:54:22 Never heard of german carrot oil whats it saying
2803 2018-10-12 18:54:13 There may be some relief in #gasprices, but since OPEC decided they were no longer happy with low oil prices, we'll all be paying more, sadly. Next year will likely see higher prices than this year.
2804 2018-10-12 18:54:03 What about tax disputes between the International Oil Company and the Host 
Government? Can this be said to be "commercial"?
@UnilagTaxClub
2805 2018-10-12 18:54:00 Actually, he was the one to sold the bombs knowing what the prince would do with them so that they can get the oil in Yemen. If you think that's ok. Or even if you think Trump wasn't aware. He is and was aware and for $. Shame on anyone of you defending that
2806 2018-10-12 18:53:58 Beverly Hills High literally has an oil derrick on campus. The optics on this are mind boggling.
2807 2018-10-12 18:53:56 Hows that crude oil price is going down still petrol/diesel prices are still increasing?
2808 2018-10-12 18:53:53 @ddailyreport your guest are good with all what they are saying but they seem to be economical with the reality, did they remember that we only built our economy around oil and at the same time little did they remember that the price crashed and that was what born the increment

2813 2018-10-12 18:53:35 it's much better to just put an egg yolk and some sesame oil in it, i agree
2814 2018-10-12 18:53:34 Proverbs are palm oil with which words are eaten.
2815 2018-10-12 18:53:28 Deposits are simply the (generally) least costly source of "settlement balances" for banks. Banks do no "lend out" their depositors' money. So, no, public money deposited with private banks is not lent to oil pipeline companies, etc.
2816 2018-10-12 18:53:27 Key to nice eyebrows put oil on them and just let them do they thing
2817 2018-10-12 18:53:26 #UKOG are showing the UK what an incredible find the Weald Oil is. And done in a very professional manner

Let's Hope #angus can do the same this time with no cock ups!
2818 2018-10-12 18:53:22 If they need to be cooked 11, I cook them 12 minutes and put olive oil in the water lol
2819 2018-10-12 18:53:19 It's got nothing to do with this government. This is a global problem; maintaining the oil supply. Trump is quite right - they'd just buy from Russia instead.

Until there's an international consensus to stop buying oil from the middle east, nothing will change.
2820 2018-10-12 18:53:08 $oil inching higher, could that be a sign market will bounce to the close???

2821 2018-10-12 18:52:59 It was absolutely *smacks chops enthusiastically* The D got us the tuna in oil which is extra yummy!
2822 2018-10-12 18:52:55 Makes you cringe really. But.
Britain's involvement with the Saudi regime is so toxic it could put our security in real danger.
The oil of the middle east can not be allowed to dictate our future.
We must cut the umbilical
2823 2018-10-12 18:52:23 Create jobs ..so that people can make their own home .they don't have money to pay installments every month ..as they don't have jobs..or  if they have jobs they have to pay oil electricity bills ,high rate of vegetables... So create jobs and try to make Good cheaper ,
2824 2018-10-12 18:52:15 Et je ne parle que des carburants de 1ere génération. La 2de optimise toute la plante, mais aussi les déchets sylvicoles. On peut aussi transformer les excédents d autres cultures comme les fruits pour faire de l'éthanol et maintenir des prix stables pour les producteurs.

2826 2018-10-12 18:52:07 No oil was checked, the tyres were flat, the water was empty
2827 2018-10-12 18:52:06 At the end though, you’d realize that the car was never real and only a ghost representing your sins, like not changing the oil or putting off rotating your tires
2828 2018-10-12 18:52:04 @bluebirdhemp Here’s to a year’s supply of hemp oil!
2829 2018-10-12 18:52:03 The rosehip oil is amazing! Morning and night I use it Just 3/4 drops. It really helped in clearing my dark spot. My moisturizer is from kiehls the only expensive thing on my list. But it’s worth it. I’m still experimenting so I’ll keep you updated!
2830 2018-10-12 18:52:00 No, I bought up the oil right posing a health risk as to the reason why parents and kids are protesting the construction underneath the school. The same risks that applied then apply to this project. Parents who fear for their kids safety and health are not the worst.
2831 2018-10-12 18:51:55 The stated reason: Metro tunnel under BH High School is dangerous- could explode oil well - plus construction impacts from staging site next to school
2832 2018-10-12 18:51:54 Oil is great for their skin and hair definitely. I think he hurt himself doing something and now he's licking it to keep it clean and it's all swollen. In case it's allergies, I'll give him an antihistamine
2833 2018-10-12 18:51:50 America, let me tell you,
These big oil companies might make you rich,
But they'll treat your metoo like like bitch,
Their need more fact checks, 
Their broken pieces we will stitch.

2834 2018-10-12 18:51:47 30 for an oil change plus tires getting rotated that’s a steal

2838 2018-10-12 18:51:28 Don't believe narrative that we can't live without oil. The first successful oil drill was in 1859. Humans *can* live without oil, and in fact have for 99.9% of our history. This narrative of "beyond repair" only serve wealthy who planets resources. To revolution!

2850 2018-10-12 18:50:38 You brought up the oil rig as evidence of Beverly Hills not being the worst. None of your statements support this argument. QED, Beverly Hills is the worst. I will, however, entertain the position that Manhattan Beach is, in fact, worse the BH.
2851 2018-10-12 18:50:22 They always are. We get ripped off by exporting oil to refineries in USA then importing back at inflated greedy prices and governments adding excessive taxes! We desperately need more refinery capacity in Canada and less owned by greedy foreign oil. We sustain low prices for USA
2852 2018-10-12 18:50:22 Awesome, thank you!!!! Love that it is simple and pretty natural. I need to delve into the world of toners. I’ve been using squalene for my face oil but have read so much good ab rosehip oil.

Roast. Enjoy.

2882 2018-10-12 18:47:33 I love coming home. Got my tires rotated, oil change, 3 shots of tequila, 5 sets of new lashes, and new lash glue all for free 
2883 2018-10-12 18:47:23 No.
2884 2018-10-12 18:47:18 I don't get how China can be buying AB oil at a discount unless they are buying it from the US. Shouldn't AB oil making it to tidewater (by rail or existing #TransMountain pipeline) be sold at world prices? I thought WCS was the price the US is gets.
2885 2018-10-12 18:47:08 Huh! Healthcare for non-citizens? The CA Coastline is already littered with Oil Drilling platforms designed by your Democrat constituents. You will over tax and spend just like every Dem before you. #JohnCox for Governor! @CAGOP
2886 2018-10-12 18:47:00 After this oil change my car should be good to go 
2887 2018-10-12 18:46:43 Thanks very much. And yep, it’s chalk pastel on black card, with an oil pastel outline... 
2888 2018-10-12 18:46:36 Your"constituents" aren't from the oil and gas industry right? Considering that's the number one donor to Republicans I'm going to assume so.... Your only loyalty is to your party. Your town that you love so much is dying. Your state is a dumping ground for fracking industry.
2889 2018-10-12 18:46:31 L'éthanol permet aussi de réguler la production sucrière les excédents partent dans la filière éthanol. Les terres consacrés à cette culture représente 0,7% des terres agricoles françaises. Et la production actuelle française peut alimenter 10 millions d autos. Donc pas de soucis
2890 2018-10-12 18:46:29 Isn’t this ignoring the large amount of data showing that olive oil consumption results in favorable cardiovascular health outcomes as opposed to seed oils just modifying a biomarker?
2891 2018-10-12 18:46:28 Olive oil...your favourite!

2895 2018-10-12 18:45:56 Oh and our front door sounds like a sad wookie. I can’t bring myself to oil it because that would mean no more wookie.
2896 2018-10-12 18:45:55 Can’t wait to get my second @Tesla! Don’t mind making you money since you do great things for humanity (Hello, Flint MI?) Besides, NEVER EVER having to go to a gas station is a life changer. No more cheap oil and no more war. Most imptly, help the planet.
2897 2018-10-12 18:45:55 Andy, I don’t understand.  The cons a very short time ago lauded the oil sands and applauded anything American.  You have a very short memory.  I find that worrisome.
2898 2018-10-12 18:45:52 Lmaooo some have to suffer more. Mine kinda erased, i was given magical medicine from dr i heard it had snake oil.

2900 2018-10-12 18:45:52 There a reason why Trump is hesitant to do anything critical about the alleged murder of Saudi journalist at the hands of a Saudi hit Squad. It’s simple greed. The Saudi are heavy investors on oil related businesses & others worth 100’s of millions of dollars
2901 2018-10-12 18:45:49 1. The rich go to private schools. Families move to 90212 rentals to be in the school district 2. Oil well has been polluting already; weird medical issues for student athletes 3. Other BH metro stations being built in prime locations; not sure what’s really happening here
2902 2018-10-12 18:45:47 If fish oil is supposed to help with memory, how come fish have terrible memory???

2904 2018-10-12 18:45:40 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
2905 2018-10-12 18:45:37 Is WhatsApp down?
2906 2018-10-12 18:45:26 George Bush and Dick Cheney...the Oil and Military complex moguls. Some power hungry politicians will stop at nothing to control the world with greedy and evil maniacal plans.
2907 2018-10-12 18:45:15 because they allegedly are important allies against Iran and supposedly aren't anti Israel. I think we should let these phony sheiks drink their own oil and remain in the stone ages just like their human rights
2908 2018-10-12 18:45:13 epic joke
You forgot to mention the moneychester city beofre the oil money

2910 2018-10-12 18:45:06 Sanctions on Iran kick back in on Nov 4th. We can't lose our supply of oil...
2911 2018-10-12 18:45:05 Smoked a little bit to go get an oil change. It’s a 2 hour wait so I burned an hour walking into Starbucks and a GameStop to check the shit out, now I’m in Red Robin getting a hamburger. Am I doing my day off correctly? #WhereaboutsOfDonna
2912 2018-10-12 18:45:03 All this defending the people at the very top makes me wonder, do you have a skewed opinion because they sign your paychecks? Do you depend on the mega rich TX oil tycoons to get your tiny slice of the pie?
2913 2018-10-12 18:45:00 So is The Ordinary shutting down or nah?? Just give me my marula oil and GO.

2916 2018-10-12 18:44:53 I too tried this once as my Mum liked lavender oil. It was quite an intense smell. Probably needed diluted a bit. So was walking around like a Yankee Candle being followed by middle class women and cats.
2917 2018-10-12 18:44:46 ON MY BIRTHDAY THIS IS COMJNG BACK TO NY yeah i get castor oil for me to be like steven now it tastes like how come home
2918 2018-10-12 18:44:42 As the oil loading from Ngamia 8 and transportation goes on well, the rig up in Amosing for the Early Pilot Facility(EPF) is 40% completed as per the PI&D obtained by our source. It's believed to be ready by March 2019.
2919 2018-10-12 18:44:35 The relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia is a close one that is based on extensive arms trading and oil deals. The deals are complemented by a strong level of political support and a deafening silence and inaction on human rights.

2921 2018-10-12 18:44:22 For most of my youth & even middle years, ME nations were tourist destinations, lands of mildly exotic, benignly mysterious & nuanced cultures where I someday hoped to roam & have captivating experiences. Western oil interests MOSTLY changed that.
2922 2018-10-12 18:44:22 
2923 2018-10-12 18:44:08 Lmao he stopped replying to me when I mentioned his oil money too  scared little boy
2924 2018-10-12 18:44:08 Lmaoooo ya hoe got a oil leak I think she need some milk
2925 2018-10-12 18:43:58 Higher gas prices drive innovation in alternative fuel sources. So if you owned stock in a natural gas or solar panel company, for example, you'd likely be doing well in times where oil prices are high. Stock just represents ownership interest in a company, theres no big mystery
2926 2018-10-12 18:43:52 Oil change then back to BG
2927 2018-10-12 18:43:49 We buy way more oil from the Saudis than they by weapons from us.  In the big picture, we don't even need their oil. Marginalizing the probable death of Khasoggi is a giant shiner in the eye of the President.
2928 2018-10-12 18:43:48 I feel something on my neck.. I have to use tea tree oil.
2929 2018-10-12 18:43:46 Money and oil has always been the reason KSA gets away with things. The policy is by no means unique to Trump.
2930 2018-10-12 18:43:43 If #Zinke is appointed UN Ambassador would it help the Interior? No, too late. The NRA, trophy hunting groups, lobbyists, Koch & former oil & gas employees are too deeply entrenched. Would it help the UN? No, Zinke has a big mouth & no brain. That will get us in a lot of trouble.
2931 2018-10-12 18:43:42 Hey I have an idea! Let’s shut in all of our own oil in Alberta, and get it from a country that executes the current leaders critics.
2932 2018-10-12 18:43:38 
2933 2018-10-12 18:43:32 The oil field was discovered in 1900. and the oil derrick has since come down. Why?
2934 2018-10-12 18:43:27 For all Justin's hate of Trump, he is providing him with cheap Alberta oil. Alberta/Sask may as well become part of US - at least we would get better oil prices and not prop up Quebec economy. @albertaseparate
2935 2018-10-12 18:43:26 Spondylosis sufferer I got hold of some honey infused with cannabis oil, 1tsp in my tea and the pain melted away, and no i was not drowsy at all, yet its illegal. but its ok for me to be now dependent on pharmaceutical morphine tramadol and be wasted in Tesco's!?

2939 2018-10-12 18:43:12 Le problème n'est pas là. C'est le fait d'échapper (jusqu'à maintenant) au malus écologique ou à la TVS qui est dénoncé ici.
2940 2018-10-12 18:43:11 Oui neutre pour l ethanol car il est fait avec  des végétaux et donc renouvelables le co2 dégagé est en partie compensé par les nouvelles plantations. Le seul hic pour 
L'E85 ce sont les 15% d'essence qu'il contient = non renouvelables.
2941 2018-10-12 18:43:11 I truly believe that if the Saudis did not have oil money that they would be throwing camel shit at each other in the desert. They are barbaric and we enable them with our addiction to oil.

2943 2018-10-12 18:43:03 Oil companies in Canada are dim if they continue to push for production growth in this environment.  Your giving away your reserves (the lifeblood of company) for nothing.  Surplus cash flow should be used to buyback stock vs grow production.  When world ready to pay then pivot.
2944 2018-10-12 18:42:53 ppl get real mad real quick when u tell them the meat/dairy industries are responsible 4 a huge amount of carbon emissions like...it's TRUE. no  one is yanking ur burgers out of ur mouth just like no one has taken away ur cars even though oil/gas companies are responsible too
2945 2018-10-12 18:42:33 Double cleansing itu bukan pake micellar water, tapi cleansing oil, cleansing balm dan cleansing milk, baru deh bisa dikatakan double cleansing
2946 2018-10-12 18:42:29 He did not bring Recession. Recession classically defined, is negative growth in GDP for two consecutive quarters. Nigeria's GDP is oil based therefore subject to positive or negative swing out oil price and production
2947 2018-10-12 18:42:25 Benning and Klefbom are on par for worst d men to ever lace it up for the oil.
2948 2018-10-12 18:42:09 Tell me why the globalists want renewable energy? Renewable energy is easy to come across and limitless (in terms of harvesting it). That makes zero sense why they want it. Oil however is hard to extract, refine, transport, etc. that means they can make big bucks. Do the math!!
2949 2018-10-12 18:42:07 I'm not saying, don't vote for Dems. I will, and will stay up late Nov. 6 to hear what happens. But what then? Dems apparently can only show climate degradation slightly slower. Still leads to catastrophe. The oil and natural gas needs to stay in the ground.
2950 2018-10-12 18:42:03 CBD Oil. Anyone w/questions feel free to DM. Praying for you Gunnar...
2951 2018-10-12 18:41:54 I think it is also important to pay more attention to the related problem of peak oil. It does not get nearly enough attention and is a result of the same activity (burning fossil fuels).
2952 2018-10-12 18:41:48 If Trudeau was really concerned about this he would have tried to renegotiate the price the US pays for CDN oil during the NAFTA talks.  Sure it wasnt part of the initial agreement but neither was a bunch of concessions that Trudeau gave the US.
2953 2018-10-12 18:41:43 It’s really good ! I love my vitamin c oil
2954 2018-10-12 18:41:34 You realise of course that placing oil pipes and fracking sites etc...in low/ unskilled employment areas is a ploy to gain public and governmental support, right?  MPs who can improve jobs in their constituencies are bound to vote in favour.
2955 2018-10-12 18:41:26 It’s very prevalent where I live. They come after me for sure. I go to Holy Eucharist, Confession, say 15 decade rosary, lots of Divine Mercy chaplets, Divine Office, and at least 20 minutes daily of Spiritual Warfare prayers. I try to get annointed with Holy Oil as well.
2956 2018-10-12 18:41:20 Produce is more expensive as oil, sugar prices decline due to government subsidies. Making fresh food something for the privileged families only.
2957 2018-10-12 18:41:09 Please... Your country has put up with the monstrosities of the Saudis for too long man. They are one of the worst countries in the world. Try to find another way to buy oil and sell weapons Senator. It is time to ask the Saudis to get their shit together or get blown up! 
2958 2018-10-12 18:41:08 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2959 2018-10-12 18:41:07 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2960 2018-10-12 18:40:55 Do you need to use an oil drum like you or will a pan that suits the amount of soup your making do?

2965 2018-10-12 18:40:35 The oil is running out.
2966 2018-10-12 18:40:32 It does now, as the revenues from oil have reduced drastically. North Sea oil is now only a minor produces, and quite a bit of that is from fields in non-Scottish waters.
2967 2018-10-12 18:40:31 I message me fam group chat and said “so who tryna pay for this oil change?” These mfs ain even respondbut if somebody say a joke they down to laugh

2974 2018-10-12 18:40:03 Buy more Saudi oil Justin - that will show them!
2975 2018-10-12 18:39:58 It also helps get us off of oil and supporting regimes like Saudi Arabia, who I believe had at least some hand in 9/11, a country with an absolutely horrendous human rights record. Venezuela, Iran and Russia also rely on oil to fund their corruption.
2976 2018-10-12 18:39:53 what is the food? i buy linda mccartney stuff but don't buy palm oil foods either, so that must've sneaked in at some point. can't tell what the package is for though.
2977 2018-10-12 18:39:49 Moth and Lamps is just the new Americans and Oil don't @ me
2978 2018-10-12 18:39:42 So I guess that means you'll vote in favor of increased oil exploration off the California coast to make up for what we buy from the Saudis?
2979 2018-10-12 18:39:39 Last guy that served me at McD’s had hair so greasy there was an oil slick in my coffee 
2980 2018-10-12 18:39:17 We have 12 years to radically reduce fossil fuels.  Canada has Paris commitments. We have to wind down the oil patch of the consequences are too severe to even contemplate. More BC and Ft MC fires, High River floods, crop failure,  dead fish in hot rivers.
2981 2018-10-12 18:39:12 The story you linked to was regarding the oil rig and the related spike in cancer among students from the era. That oil rig was there with the approval of the city and school board.
2982 2018-10-12 18:38:55 The thinking is if 2% of the world's oil are in oilfield X, then making it illegal to pump oilfield X will decrease the max limit on C02 emissions by 2%. Drugs differ in that the max supply is essentially infinite.
2983 2018-10-12 18:38:40 Bio oil smells so good I want to bathe in just a massive bath tub of it

2986 2018-10-12 18:38:16 orangutans originate in Somalia and are threaten by the deforestation of their home due to palm oil production. it is used in a lot of home and food products all over the world. They are the only other mammal who, like humans, keep their offspring for years.

To have kept this country fiscally afloat despite the massive drop in oil revenue and a depleted foreign reserve (which he has now grown) , is a miracle by Nigerian standards.
2989 2018-10-12 18:37:32 Health tip - Almond oil boosts memory when taken orally, and helps with hair growth as a hair oil.
2990 2018-10-12 18:37:31 I’ve always had problems with Midas. I know that doesn’t really help you at the moment, but they’ve always managed to stretch my oil changes and inspections into other stuff. I go to Jiffy Lube where they don’t have tires and stuff to try to upsell you.

2993 2018-10-12 18:37:12 There was a commercial for cooking oil back in the day, that featured chefs speaking in their languages about chapati. 
This was in Kenya, when there were plenty of Ugandans in exile from Obote's tyranny.
One of the chefs spoke Luganda. 
This still means a lot to me.

2996 2018-10-12 18:37:07 ha  this  has been  going  on since  campaign.. 
one  good  reason  Trumpo  reneged  on  Iran deal.. as  Saudis  were moaning  about  drop of their oil  to  1970's prices since  deal w as made.. big  question..  how much kickbacks  did  they  give  Trump  Crime  family?
2997 2018-10-12 18:37:07 The economic ignorance of illegal advocates in general population is astounding. The very same ppl protest income inequality, wages,  poverty and paucity of Gov services.
Their solution, import more poor people by the millions..
2998 2018-10-12 18:36:59 An old moldy stump is a better choice than Robert Francis; drunk squirrels are a better choice; a rusty, leaky, bucket is a better choice; a barrel of used oil is a better choice; there are thousands of objects that would make a better choice than Robert Francis O’Rourke.

3001 2018-10-12 18:36:44 Well, maybe angels lose power as Heaven loses power.  We saw before that Cas lost powers when he was cut off from Heaven.

But real answer...better for the story.  

On that note, I think they should have used a ring of holy oil fire to trap Cas.  ...works for story + lore.

3011 2018-10-12 18:35:46 Who wanna pay for my oil and stuff so I can do this oil change ? Ion feel like spending 
3012 2018-10-12 18:35:43 So climate change affects temperature in production facilities?  Why can't we just be honest and say climate change is energy/oil?
3013 2018-10-12 18:35:38 The Saudis may retaliate by reducing the crude oil output, and with Iranian sanctions in place, this will lead to a rise in global fuel prices.....halafu everyone runs to beg them

3016 2018-10-12 18:35:24 ABOUT CBD OIL... 

1. I don’t know what it is. 

2. I have heard about it and am curious what it is. 

3. I have wanted to try it, just haven't yet. 

4. I take it every day and love it! 

Which one are you?
3017 2018-10-12 18:35:18 3/ kids are now either parents or have friends who are parents in the district and are threatening to take their kids out of school because the planned construction is in the exact same area where the now inactive oil derrick was located on campus.

It makes great quick lo mein FYI. Just cook it till just a bit al dente, drain the water off, and only sprinkle with 1/2 the spice packet. Add sesame oil, sesame seeds if U fancy.

3025 2018-10-12 18:34:32 Most of my research points to a global flooding of the oil market and a lack of interest in environmental protection programs as the main reasons for not wanting to invest. Global uncertainty isn’t the lib govs fault and companies who want to trash the enviro can go elsewhere.

3030 2018-10-12 18:34:12 Problem is that even electricity produced uses oil via power plants. If there was an easy way to change battery while the other is charging, and also have some sort of ability to charge them with sunlight/wind power, that would be great.
3031 2018-10-12 18:34:10 Oil is thicker than blood
3032 2018-10-12 18:34:08 Let's face it. Andrew Scheer is simply lying to his base, who probably do think that a Prime Minister can control the world price of oil.
3033 2018-10-12 18:33:59 All industries in the whole world were in need of it. Everything you touch has a connection to oil. The wealth that cheap energy has produced has allowed us to leave the fields to make food and allowed women autonomy from the constant work of a farm wife and pursue an education.
3034 2018-10-12 18:33:55 How about you get our economy going and diversify beyond mining and oil and gas. We are still struggling with companies going broke and not enough various infrastructure work going on. Far out when are you people going to start doing something different.

3039 2018-10-12 18:33:30 One neoliberal criticizing another neoliberal because he is not neoliberal enough. The problem is that the carbon tax externalizes the cost of pollution from those that profit from its extraction to consumers. It does nothing to discourage oil producers who pollute.
3040 2018-10-12 18:33:30 There is no law and punishment for those who are spreading CANCER by producing FAKE milk and FAKE OIL. Civil society shd check these cheaters.
3041 2018-10-12 18:33:26 MBS is in a tough spot. Both RU & US(fracking) want to see higher oil prices. And political instability in KSA seems to be a good way of achieving that.  Perhaps JK is a genius after all? it seems the Kushnerite has stepped into a trap.

3054 2018-10-12 18:32:11 I read something about Corbin I thought...maybe not. Why are you so picky about telling me where you are from? Do you think that I might accuse you of hypocrisy for using oil where you live ;)
3055 2018-10-12 18:32:05 If you gave a fuck about principle, you wouldn’t use oil based products... but you ignore that and get up on your high horse.

3058 2018-10-12 18:31:55 Now that crude oil price has increased, is there any difference? Same story, same complaint!
3059 2018-10-12 18:31:39 Pt 2: Since mid '15 - US mkts had declines in Aug '15 (China currency deval); in Jan '16, (oil prices down); in Jun '16, (Brexit vote); in the run-up to the '16 US Prez election; & in 2018 (trade concerns). Still, during this 3yrs, the mkt was up more than 30% cumulatively.
3060 2018-10-12 18:31:39 Frame 1 is just amazing.

3063 2018-10-12 18:31:08 97% of scientific community says climate change is real. Yet 50% of Canadians disagree. That's like saying gravity isn't real. But it's a market for political snake oil salesmen like Ford & Kenney. But not addressing it commits our grandchildren to tragedy & social violence

3080 2018-10-12 18:28:54 This is why this is some much more subtle than “here is a robot from [insert snake oil sales pitch]” and do it by year end ... that’s what is lacking in much of what we’re suffering in terms of hype! Also some change part (education) will take 10 years to play out.
3081 2018-10-12 18:28:51 Lovely. Or after roasting ‘em: Fry olive oil, chorizo and smoked pancetta with shallots add a big squeeze of tom purée, garlic and chillies then add all toms and juices to the pan big glug of red wine boil then simmer on low heat for at least an hour. Serve with pasta

3115 2018-10-12 18:26:07 There is no reason that Scotland should have more per head spent on it than anyother part of the UK. Indy support talk about oil money. With interest & inflation, how much is the English bailout of Scotland in the 1600s worth & how much did Scots make from the Empire.

3141 2018-10-12 18:24:19 Tissue and coconut oil
3142 2018-10-12 18:24:12 I’m not gonna lie and say that I’m fully about to  boycott WWE over the upcoming oil and blood money grab event in Saudi Arabia. But I do think I’ll skip watching it and maybe just watch Evolution twice.
3143 2018-10-12 18:24:03 He is a puppet just like others who they have served before him. Instead of tackling the existing problems,he is creating further more complexities. These all are taking place due to his unconsiderable steps like banning of jobs and oil business.
3144 2018-10-12 18:24:01 While I was at work my dad changed my oil, filled up my car and brought me lunch  I don’t deserve him
3145 2018-10-12 18:24:00 Dear @atiku can you extend this generosity by giving me a scholarship opportunity to do my Masters in civil engineering at your university???
3146 2018-10-12 18:23:49 He still sells them weapons and buys their oil.
3147 2018-10-12 18:23:43 I know I'm a 40 year old man but I stayed up too late playing video games and now I'm sleepy gonna be out cold at the oil change place
3148 2018-10-12 18:23:30 @marthamaccallum Why feature political strategists so often? Aren't they really just snake oil salespeople who promote party campaigns no matter the ideology? Candidates don't matter. Isn't it all about scoring wins for the party, using whatever tactics? Seems a phony existence.
3149 2018-10-12 18:23:28 It started with the Saud/Bush "family" 100 years ago.  OIL is what is really important, although to Lump it's just money and "The Deal".
3150 2018-10-12 18:23:26 Also, @OswinBenjamin by you need to give @lostinvegas83 the lyrics to Olive Oil. I want you to succeed. You could be the next dreamville artist. 
Or be independent. I've followed you since sway in the morning freestyle and I want you to succeed. So what do I have to do to help?

Top tip.... wrap in foil, sprinkle with salt and olive oil. Bake until golden.
3157 2018-10-12 18:23:01 Cats used to have a whole dickie suit and ain’t even know how to change they oil. Looking like an unskilled mechanic

3160 2018-10-12 18:22:58 I put rosemary oil in my shoes the other day, but more than expected came out and I was paranoid all day that it was too strong
3161 2018-10-12 18:22:55 Run a hot bath then pour lavender oil and rose petals and your fave bubble bath mix with a cup of camomile tea not only is it healthy for the skin and and the tea is good for your voice it's supposed to bring good luck especially if you mix bath salts inside
3162 2018-10-12 18:22:52 Clove oil works to numb the area. Think of it as adult oral gel
3163 2018-10-12 18:22:42 Trump came out and admitted what Obama and Bush would never admit. Instead of lying about it he just said "yea we're not doing anything to Saudi Arabia because they have oil, and they keep us paid" ....

That's why politicians can't stand him. He's too dumb to hide their evil lol
3164 2018-10-12 18:22:40 Since the price of crude oil started going up, the Buhari administration hardly talks about economic diversification. 

How far with the economic diversification campaign?

I am just Atikulating.
3165 2018-10-12 18:22:37 I got my oil changed & they didn’t put a sticker in my window when I’m suppose to come back for my next one, so here I am frantically calling my dad with a minor inconvenience about my car.
3166 2018-10-12 18:22:33 Boss I go like make you assist me for my palm oil business whichever way you can i will be very much glad and grateful sir..
3167 2018-10-12 18:22:30 If chicken is made on the stove with olive oil, is it grilled or fried?

3170 2018-10-12 18:22:19 Suncor would love to be able to receive Canadian oil.  Too bad Montreal vitoed the energy east retrofit.
3171 2018-10-12 18:22:12 sauté a small amount of olive oil, LOTS OF SPINACH, garlic paste, some cherry tomatoes , onion powder/onion if you have it . I season it with cumin and add hot sauce but that’s super optional. Eat alone as a snack or Add eggs for a yummy scramble // chicken for a yummy dinner 
3172 2018-10-12 18:22:07 Use the oil!
3173 2018-10-12 18:22:03 i’ve been drinking olive oil straight and i can’t believe the difference it’s made. i feel incredible. my insides have never been so lubricated
3174 2018-10-12 18:22:02 seems like market has shown some strength even after global market does not see so strong, crude oil has cooled off , rupee has shown some strength, but this is the time not to go short but going long should be in bits and pieces
3175 2018-10-12 18:21:59 Strange but true. With a non oil deficit c 9% at present you can see how!
3176 2018-10-12 18:21:59 そう、それそれ
3177 2018-10-12 18:21:57 Lawd lets get the Holy Oil lol jk it will get better
3178 2018-10-12 18:21:55 Amen!
3179 2018-10-12 18:21:54 That's so cool.  You grow loads of them and harvest the heads once finished and ripe and some how extract the oil from the heads
3180 2018-10-12 18:21:54 Why dont you come home and explain why we are selling our oil for $20  and importing offshore oil into eastern Canada and paying $74 ...seems stupid to me
3181 2018-10-12 18:21:45 That's just a lot of words for "I dgaf about principle".

As if there aren't other ways of making money than investing in oil.
3182 2018-10-12 18:21:44 @georgegalloway @talkRADIO as turkey is a NATO member can we expect expulsions of Saudi diplomats from Anchora to Athens from London to Berlin from Washington to Warsaw? I think not .Someone will pour Saudi oil over troubled waters western hypocrisy will win out again?

3186 2018-10-12 18:21:19 Nobody give 2 shits about Saudi Arabia except their oil. Quit trying to make it look like something to blame Trump on.
3187 2018-10-12 18:21:18 They don’t want the oil just the soil that’s beneath that.
3188 2018-10-12 18:21:05 なんかおもしろいゲームないかな
3189 2018-10-12 18:21:01 Politicians are paid extremely well by big energy companies that have a stake in it to keep digging coal and drilling for oil.
I give it 25 years tops before major population change starts happening 
Like in the millions
3190 2018-10-12 18:20:59 Thanks for sharing. Definitely has similarities and with tightening supply and lower capex spending the recipe is there for a higher move in #oil prices.

3193 2018-10-12 18:20:50 Sadly, I am. I service all the Chinese visitors coming to see the 7 US Oil Companies you mention. At least more Koreans have been coming recently.
3194 2018-10-12 18:20:48 Bit you're right, I can't bear the fact that our spineless leaders treat your repulsive leaders with any kind of respect, but sadly they feel compelled to put our access to your oil and arms buyers ahead of basic human decency.
3195 2018-10-12 18:20:46 Saudi knows they'll be pardoned for whatever crimes against humanity they commit as long as they're providing that sweet, sweet oil. This isn't the first time Saudi has done horrific things to innocent people, and not the first time the US has turned the other way :/
3196 2018-10-12 18:20:44 I think we have underhand relationships with all these rich people and oil rich countries.. it's a shame lives are so expendable.. Much like the Babies at the border who were stolen from their parents and jailed. Seems like they have been forgotten also.. 
3197 2018-10-12 18:20:38 went to get my oil changed and they told me my car has a “significant oil leak” somewhere and i have to take it somewhere to get it checked out. good lord it never ends
3198 2018-10-12 18:20:37 Hell yeah you could buy oil off my face :(
3199 2018-10-12 18:20:36 Why the oil companies?
3200 2018-10-12 18:20:33 あとね、頭が良くなった気分になれる
3201 2018-10-12 18:20:23 Well processing of Lithium isnt that climate and environment friendly. But it is still better than oil.
3202 2018-10-12 18:20:20 Never using anything other than this Coconut  Oil. The smell, the feel of it on my skin, the glow it gives my skin. Absolute Greatness

3205 2018-10-12 18:20:04 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This October, read labels carefully.
3206 2018-10-12 18:20:04 CBD oil helps me massively! Good luck! X
3207 2018-10-12 18:20:00 That is insane! So if you had ordered paracetamol (or any other vaguely 'dangerous' medication) and matches/firelighters/6 tonnes of drying oil it would be ok? It is pretty obvious it is a FAMILY shop

3211 2018-10-12 18:19:36 Thats super cool, love the oil painting vibe.
3212 2018-10-12 18:19:31 In light of the ICPP report, we should incentivize oil companies to help with geoengineering to extend the ice of the Arctic and research on cloud seeding instead of investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure.
3213 2018-10-12 18:19:28 Especially DRC or the Congo - those bastards want to drill for oil @gorillacd @SaveVirunga That will harm the mountain gorillas which are starting to thrive again. The planet will suffer.

3217 2018-10-12 18:19:16 I am in TX, we hv some of the largest pipe lines, oil refineries right out there n the Bay, ect, ect.. BUT... When the price skyrocketed some yrs ago & I road tripped to California, their gas ended up being slightly cheaper than what I was paying back home. I was surprised.
3218 2018-10-12 18:19:11 頭に非常識乗ってる！
3219 2018-10-12 18:19:10 Guess what? Some Republicans used to be leaders on climate change, until all the oil and gas money overwhelmed the party. This used to be a bipartisan issue. If enough constituents were educated, organized and flooded them with demands for action OR ELSE, they might do something.

3223 2018-10-12 18:19:00 Just walked in on my neighbour helping herself to cooking oil out of my fridge.
She was somewhat apologetic. 
I'd have been upset if my post-nap haze wasn't so strong I didn't actually realise she was talking to me.

3225 2018-10-12 18:18:54 Yet protest it peacefully and legally, you will get put inside. Especially if the Judge has shares in the oil business. Welcome to the most corrupt country on Earth......
3226 2018-10-12 18:18:50 So glad my dad was ahead of his time and made sure his “girls” knew how to change their car oil and tires; do yard work; and how to use tools, including proper name and use. Just took on the major assembly of an item and nailed it. Thanks dad in heaven. #dadsindependentgirl
3227 2018-10-12 18:18:47 Wife of an oil baron?
3228 2018-10-12 18:18:41 I would rather use Alberta oil and gas than Middle East 'BLOOD OIL' the money generated used for terrorism and political interference to further Islamic dominance. The UN is corrupted by the OIC's 57 member voting block.
3229 2018-10-12 18:18:31 In my more cynical moments I assume that if Quebec had oil reserves everyone in Canada would have a pipeline going through their living room.
3230 2018-10-12 18:18:30 Gaddafi was a different type of fuckhead. Man had a small population with one of the largest oil reserves in the world and he still managed to fuck up. A certain part of me respects the way the Gulf countries took advantage of their resources and developed into prosperous states

3232 2018-10-12 18:18:23 Saudi Arabia has significant global influence for ONE reason alone: its oil reserves. And the world is turning to renewable energy...
3233 2018-10-12 18:18:23 Sadly this has been happening since before Trump. So long as we get our oil and they pay for weapons the US government tends to look the other way for Saudi Arabia. Just look at 9/11, most of the attackers were from there and nothing happened.
3234 2018-10-12 18:18:17 My mother was talking to a woman she knew "she was goin on about her son :worked in a garage "she was complaining about the oil on her sheets ''as the son sleeps with his garage overalls on in bed "clothes and all on underneath ::ha ha "a true story 'i know him ha ha

3239 2018-10-12 18:18:07 My boy has inherited my musical taste. Fron the Beatles to Metallica. Midnight OIl to Black Sabbath. So proud.
3240 2018-10-12 18:18:04 Look at this olive oil , a produce of Balochistan .. i dont trust the label though. Isnt it impressive? Spain aur italy ke tarah hamara b olive oil hay janab..
3241 2018-10-12 18:17:57 White fragility on display. How about move your school built upon oil wells?
3242 2018-10-12 18:17:47 I've been dairy free for health reasons and started making hot cocoa with a spoon or 2 of baker's cocoa, 1/2 teaspoon of coconut oil for creaminess, teaspoon of real vanilla extract - has calming effect in the brain, & spoonful of sugar if I want sweet, but also have w no sugar
3243 2018-10-12 18:17:47 Don't worry, we are on our way to become little Russia or worse :) At least you have oil and natural gas, we only have a third-grade lignite which pollutes air. In fact, the lack of proper education for generations since 1980s has brought us to this point: Ignorance of masses.
3244 2018-10-12 18:17:36 I seem to note that there is obsession about cooking oil which is "now awash" and USD rates that have tumbled. What about the rest of the products that are required in a human being's life.
It's not over as yet.
3245 2018-10-12 18:17:18 Investigation in progress ?! Oh thats interesting ! So you lot actually respect investigations , as far as I know that has not been the case for Iran , Lebanon and Syria for about 40 years , been bribing UN with your oil money for 40 years to cover blood by Saudies
3246 2018-10-12 18:17:09 The cod liver oil tasted like french kissing a fish.

3250 2018-10-12 18:16:47 The people changing my oil dropped a tool in my engine bay and have been trying to retrieve it for almost 2 hours now. Shoot me in the fucking face.
3251 2018-10-12 18:16:45 Hi I’m 20 and I don’t know how to check the oil level in my car
3252 2018-10-12 18:16:37 Getting my oil changed. My dad would be proud.
3253 2018-10-12 18:16:18 That is funny for you Eddie..

3255 2018-10-12 18:15:59 Exactly, a good quality natural oil/conditioner on leather and it'll last and last.
3256 2018-10-12 18:15:46 This is not a fair tweet. I know many of these kids - they are not advocating that there shouldn’t be a metro that goes west side. They truly believe (rightly or wrongly) that because of the gas/oil situation it’s going to increase cancer cases and lead to mass health problems.
3257 2018-10-12 18:15:45 HOMBRE,  130.000€ yo no gano, pero gas oil  al coche sí que le echo, y alguna operación en bolsa de 10 o 15 mill€ también sí que hago, así que a mí que soy media baja, baja, sí que me sube los impuestos.

3261 2018-10-12 18:15:28 I just thot it interesting & a needed reminder that there r other industries besides obvious oil & gas contributing to global crisis that will end us. I was then directed to study re:feeding cows seaweed to reduce methane. If we can feed them plastic w/ same result, I’m thrilled!
3262 2018-10-12 18:15:27 I literally put coconut oil on everything
3263 2018-10-12 18:15:27 Nothing better than walking out to your car after a oil change and it’s jus dazzlin because they washed it:)
3264 2018-10-12 18:15:24 Career Politicians
Make a career of 
being on their best behaviour
selling the public snake oil
One day every 5 years
Rest of time they are self-serving hypocrites, overseen by themselves ffs
Voting in pay-rises and claiming lavish expenses
3265 2018-10-12 18:15:22 Snake oil salesman. Learned from the President.
3266 2018-10-12 18:15:18 I remember these! It's supposed to have little vials of the thing in those circles. I have no idea who made them or why though.

Also, is there anything more Alberta than putting oil first, before actual food and, y'know, the earth?
3267 2018-10-12 18:15:11 Your a jalop now. You have to change your own oil and do your own brakes on any future car. Those are the rules.
3268 2018-10-12 18:15:11 lol I'm wearing virtually the same shirt...bloody scary. Turkish barbers.....just watch the flames with all that oil about lol
3269 2018-10-12 18:15:11 Either that or Neck Oil :)
3270 2018-10-12 18:15:11 Since i stopped using coconut oil my hair gas been silkier abd softer than ever. Have you tried other alternatives?
3271 2018-10-12 18:15:10 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
3272 2018-10-12 18:15:07 True. Added advantages are that awards can be enforced abroad easily due the The New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.

Also it's Confidential.
Another is that Arbitrators can be experts in Oil and Gas.

So much better than litigation.
3273 2018-10-12 18:15:04 Definitely do it.   Sunflower seeds grow lots and harvest for oil and sell to make extra money lol
3274 2018-10-12 18:15:02 I agree with jmac on this one. While there are very big problems with how these countries are run, US intervention because of oil greed is just as big of a problem
3275 2018-10-12 18:15:00 you're not a man if you don't work an oil field job
3276 2018-10-12 18:14:58 fo not forget HE stripped ALL PROTECTIONS of Canadas waterways. Open them up to fracking, daming, polluting and oil drilling.
3277 2018-10-12 18:14:58 Something's wrong with my eyes lately... Time to time I feel like they're shaking (like an emotional anime character) and sometimes I feel like having an "oil curtain" and it's hard to see clearly.
3278 2018-10-12 18:14:57 Thank God for black seed oil 
3279 2018-10-12 18:14:45 Want #Tesla and humanity to succeed?  Buy Tesla cars and invest in the company. Take the power away from the oil barons, legacy auto and shorts!
3280 2018-10-12 18:14:37 I despise the corruption that has halted progress to finding alternate solutions to free us from a dependence on oil. But I live in the here and now, as a person of limited means, I can ill afford to be idealistic when making financial investments
3281 2018-10-12 18:14:27 We must be careful on this Internet space, there are grown ass men that chase men and unsuspecting young one's all looking fr ways to defile them, especially on IG, pls ensure you enlighten your younger ones and check their phones when need be, so they don't fall victims.
3282 2018-10-12 18:14:25 Barbarians with oil and money. A dangerous combination.
3283 2018-10-12 18:14:25 Oil blotting sheets are single-handedly the coolest and the nastiest things I’ve ever used. #IHaveIssues #FixItJesus
3284 2018-10-12 18:14:25 I wish scotland would go independent. They will be in for a shock how much or lack of revenue scottish oil produces. They think they can charge morre tac. But oil companies will just shift elsewhere
3285 2018-10-12 18:14:23 やることが！ねえ！
3286 2018-10-12 18:14:06 Leather oil is probably better for your beard and skin anyway.
3287 2018-10-12 18:13:32 Ghee flame has a more soothing effect on surrounding .. but among oils sesame oil is considered best for lighting diyas..
3288 2018-10-12 18:13:30 A Illusion called Choice Finery where you have the best life while massaging beards with coconut oil
3289 2018-10-12 18:13:29 What utter .   Syria has the right to have Russian energy firms rehabilitate its oil & gas fields.   That’s not “seizing”.  It’s none of the US govt’s business.
3290 2018-10-12 18:13:27 5 FREE oil changes just for giving us a chance! We are THAT confident we can EARN your business! Come by 3253 SW. Military Dr. and check out our inventory!

3291 2018-10-12 18:13:25 @KelloggCompany do all of you products use sustainable palm oil yet?
3292 2018-10-12 18:13:20 People who don't believe in climate change has to believe in abiotic oil to get their model to work. But the scientists are annoyingly connected to reality.
3293 2018-10-12 18:13:17 If JT has real serious concerns with Saudi Arabia he would cut of oil imports and use Canadian oil.
3294 2018-10-12 18:13:15 I'd rather him in ring here in front of real fans and not rich oil barons and pampered prince pricks
3295 2018-10-12 18:13:05 I suppose one could assume if you’re not willing to teach your kid not to be a little asshole you probably don’t bother to keep them clean. Tea tree oil spray just in case.
3296 2018-10-12 18:13:00 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
3297 2018-10-12 18:13:00 Angola is another oil rich nation, no refinery, Guinea as well. Many African nations are still in the extractive mode 
3298 2018-10-12 18:13:00 Talk about an expensive oil change
3299 2018-10-12 18:12:57 Religion has nothing to do with this. With the Yanks and the Saudis it never has. This is about money and the sell off of state oil in Saudi Arabia, Aramco. This is who hosts the sale. U.K. or USA. It's also about telling others to stay in line. It's a set up, I believe.
3300 2018-10-12 18:12:57 @realDonaldTrump The increase on oil price is unacceptable. It would be partly the consequence of the Iranian embargo.
3301 2018-10-12 18:12:54 Did she called him ashawo?
3302 2018-10-12 18:12:53 Next week the World Series of Earnings will be trading LIVE from the @StateFairOfTX. Long corndogs and peanut oil ahead of the event
3303 2018-10-12 18:12:52 Okay yo I got this same issue with melatonin. I burn dried lavender sprigs in the room before going to sleep, and I’ll also sometimes take a hot bath with lavender oil n such. There are cbd oil pills that do not get you high, just real relaxed and sleepy. They work wonders 4me
3304 2018-10-12 18:12:39 Sitting in Performance Honda getting my oil changed being judged by everyone else in the waiting room bc I'm scoffing at the news
3305 2018-10-12 18:12:18 Vous n’y êtes pas du tout car ce n’est pas les constructeurs qui vont offrir ces malus car ils ont besoin d’une rentabilité sinon ils peuvent mettre la clé sous la porte. Le problème ce que beaucoup de personnes croient que l’argent sortent des caniveaux mais il faut le produire.
3306 2018-10-12 18:12:12 We have our own oil. Lots of it. And if oil is the justification then say it. Don’t act like the bastion of moral goodness in the world.
3307 2018-10-12 18:12:09 That right..if the electrical energy u use dont came from a fossil production like oil or nuclear
3308 2018-10-12 18:12:05 Haha, that's what it was though,  darn leather oil all over the place! At least it's cheeper than specific haor and beard oil I suppose 
3309 2018-10-12 18:12:00 It is infuriating to me that they think that drops of oil is going to b the cure all for us.
I will not lie. I hv tried marajuana, & hv had some success to a degree..but once we had 2 start pissing n a cup every month, that  was taken away. CBD oil only has like 0.3% of pot...
3310 2018-10-12 18:11:56 This is precisely why we support you thick and thin. The "shorts" harass me when I say: I support Tesla and Elon regardless of the cost, because he is transforming our dependency on gasoline and oil. It's worth it to me, even if I lose every dime of my investment.

3312 2018-10-12 18:11:45 1 up with 2 to play. 4 ball final. Pulls my approach to the par 5 into thick rough. 4 of us eventually find it. Terrible lie. 64° oil can slices through the rough,comes out perfectly, lands  soft on links greens and runs out to a tap in. Opponents fail to make bird. #UpandDown
3313 2018-10-12 18:11:36 Yes, on a personal level that will happen, but for us as a country, we would jeopardize our oil and gun exchange with them.  This is not chump change, but I believe we should break these ties.
3314 2018-10-12 18:11:28 @firsNigeria Please can you clarify withholding tax on diesel supply. Our company diesel suppliers refuse us to deduct withholding tax claiming oil marketing companies are exempted from petroleum products.FIRS auditors otherwise maintained a compulsory deduction on diesel supply
3315 2018-10-12 18:11:20 Do you think crude oil would go higher from here ?
3316 2018-10-12 18:11:06 Sometimes we had too much oil...
3317 2018-10-12 18:10:57 Biasanya gue suka nonton iklan, tapi iklan pond's men lighting oil clear yang lagi dinner trus ada mas mas keker dateng tiba-tiba gitu super engga bgt deh. gelik

3321 2018-10-12 18:10:41 An alternative is for Canada to fund projects in other nations that aren't in the clutches of the oil and gas industry and reduce our shortfall of CO2 emissions there. The atmosphere is indifferent as to where the emissions come from.

3330 2018-10-12 18:10:00 This ought to be the best batch of chili ever. I accidentally melted my instant pot cord AND managed to get serrano pepper oil in my septum piercing.
3331 2018-10-12 18:09:51 Many of the vessels used for oil spill recover can be outfitted for dual purpose, oils spill and garbage collection.  Use funding in this bill to use these vessels for garbage collection when not in use for oil spill recovery
3332 2018-10-12 18:09:35 Since the discovery of oil in commercial quantities by Shell D'Arcy, International 
Oil Companies have operated under several agreements for oil exploration 
and production. In carrying out these agreements, disputes are bound to arise.
3333 2018-10-12 18:09:25 We need to take a long look at how the US (before Trump) has conducted itself regarding the outrageous horrors of Saudi Arabia.  9/11 and support of Al Queda is a Saudi affair, but nary a word from the US, because we buy their oil and they buy our weapons. Is Jared the ambassador
3334 2018-10-12 18:09:24 Haha we'll make an exception for you....at least you're oiling a leather saddle; proper work, not going to the spa and having your manbun combed and beard oil massaged into your beard
3335 2018-10-12 18:09:22 Damn, Can we get the recipe tho  cause oil and seasoning ain’t enough lmaooo
3336 2018-10-14 23:59:41 like fractionated coconut oil, avocado or grape seed oil!

3338 2018-10-14 23:59:30 I recently spent an evening watching cooking shows about how to make the "best" eggs. Didn't see much olive oil. I prefer butter myself, though I'll use olive oil if I'm going for a something more Mediterranean.
3339 2018-10-14 23:59:22 Right. Any trillion dollar cash flow industry is doing wrong in some aspect. 

My point is we need to focus on bigger problems which are overlooked when oil companies get so much blame mostly because people are ignorant to what and how they actually operate.
3340 2018-10-14 23:59:17 That doesn't make sense. Increased return requires increased production and therefore increased emissions. Unless the increased return is the result of an increased royalty payment per barrel of oil.
3341 2018-10-14 23:59:09 I would love to pour oil down your back and rub off up and Down your spine
3342 2018-10-14 23:59:08 A little tidbit of info. Many employers in the oil patch prefer Mexican workers. They show up, they work hard & they mind their own business.

3345 2018-10-14 23:58:51 Exxon/Mobile would salivate over $200 a barrel oil.
3346 2018-10-14 23:58:45 I understand your position and think it is quite difficult to calculate our strategic interest here.  I do think that we should open up our own oil production to become independent from these evil regimes.  Also, what that country has done in Yemen is horrific and underreported.
3347 2018-10-14 23:58:28 No president can take a tough stand against Saudi Arabia. We are addicted to their oil.
Or we could try to go a month without oil and see how that goes...
3348 2018-10-14 23:58:21 There are just far too many burger restaurants in #Auckland now. The caramelised onion, special sauce & fat, pink beef patty thing is overdone! And why must you brush oil all over my bun?!! Please.... enough.
3349 2018-10-14 23:58:13 I was born in NY. Moved to Houston at 6 months. Dad worked for an oil company, so lived all over. Sooo many games in the Dome during the 70’s and early 80’s. Moved to No Cali in ‘84. That is when I became a Seahawk fan.
3350 2018-10-14 23:58:13 once it's incorporated enough to de-emulsify it literally ceases to be mayonnaise so it isn't even a "gotcha" it's just eggs and oil again.
3351 2018-10-14 23:58:02 God it’s so salty! I do add other ingredients tho, usually sriracha and sesame oil and whatever veggies I have and tofu.

3376 2018-10-14 23:57:30 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3377 2018-10-14 23:57:24 The U.S. actually gets most of its imported oil from Canada, Latin America and Africa. We learned during the oil embargo of the 1970's to never depend on Saudi Arabia for oil. Murdering journalists carries the price of Democracy. F**k Saudi Arabia.

3382 2018-10-14 23:57:01 Canada has oil at $16.00 a barrel but nobody wants it.
3383 2018-10-14 23:56:57 Even if US doesn’t import oil from SaudiArabia, this latter can still drive oil prices way high and make it more expensive for US to buy.
3384 2018-10-14 23:56:57 I can’t find a proper ingredients list on the UK site but from what little info there is it looks like majority grapeseed oil as a carrier. Could knock that whole product together for less than a fiver.
3385 2018-10-14 23:56:49 Beto is a snake oil salesman.
3386 2018-10-14 23:56:33 trump is without peer if he had a brain to match watch out...anyway that's my bet we will get a spike in oil to 75 and will then fall a fast 5 buvks when everyone starte fellating one another again
3387 2018-10-14 23:56:32 Assuming standard SAE 30 is just mineral oil you can actually run it without harm for a short time

3389 2018-10-14 23:56:12 Well, trump did f'up our relationship with Canada , one of our largest trading partner in oil...

3390 2018-10-14 23:56:07 So do something for once...stop the patter and reduce Alberta's Carbon Tax to zero and start turning off the oil pipeline taps to BC...See how quickly phoney Trudeau will legislate the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion... Do it
3391 2018-10-14 23:56:02 #SaudiArabia can ask for oil to be prices in Euro, Yen, yuan or other currency which will not be good for the $.

3393 2018-10-14 23:55:44 Then why not rely on technology and industry advances to replace old, dirty and dying energy sources, instead of continuing to line the pockets of oil and coal? There are ways to lessen the impact to workers while saving our air and water. Don't listen to unimaginative lies.
3394 2018-10-14 23:55:39 He "may have" felt emboldened by the fact he is an absolute monarch who has the US by the short hairs with oil production, arms purchases, etc.   He will pay a price but no more the Henry the VIII paid while beheading his numerous wives or more aptly Sir Thomas Moore.
3395 2018-10-14 23:55:14 All about oil..
3396 2018-10-14 23:55:09 I think the confusion may be meaning of “break-even.” Saudis can produce oil for well under $50/bbl (*well* under). But need much higher prices to balance budget (and that number keeps rising). (Apologies if this is not the source of confusion.)
3397 2018-10-14 23:54:53 I need an oil plug, pls and thanks :*
3398 2018-10-14 23:54:51 Do you need to be that handy in order to have a Wrangler?

I'm going to need a replacement vehicle (hopefully not for a few years yet) & have been looking hard at the Wrangler for the versatility.

But I can change oil/tires & that's it.
3399 2018-10-14 23:54:23 I only use the tree oil at night though

3406 2018-10-14 23:53:47 New England is so screwed. We've been making up our shortages by running oil plants that are rapidly being retired. One of these winters we're going to have rolling black outs.
3407 2018-10-14 23:53:44 America does not need their oil. Americans oil is better
3408 2018-10-14 23:53:41 What. A. Clown.

3409 2018-10-14 23:53:31 using an essential oil with the name “Joy” and it smells like baby lotion
3410 2018-10-14 23:53:29 While you are patting yourself on the back we are sending our oil to the US at prices 80% less then world prices and then the US sells it back to us as refined product at world prices. Shame on you!!!!

3413 2018-10-14 23:53:02 Might as well make it 90% chance. Republicans love those odds.
3414 2018-10-14 23:52:52 Yeah...poor choice of words. Not an endorsement. But this regime would probably do that. Another administration would go in and buy oil and help prop up the country. This one would plunder it.
3415 2018-10-14 23:52:51 There’s no intelligent reason why the citizenry should be out gunned by our government. Beto is a snake oil salesman.
3416 2018-10-14 23:52:45 I just impulsively bought detergent, vegetable oil and Gatorade.
3417 2018-10-14 23:52:44 We all know the political bias those scientists have due to the thousands of thousands of dollars in grant money they’re chasing compared to oil companies and their billions in profits
3418 2018-10-14 23:52:36 Refusing to turn the heat on in my house because I’m almost out of oil (delivery coming later this week), but also because I refuse to believe that it’s heat-on season.
3419 2018-10-14 23:52:30 I use butter in lieu of olive oil or peanut oil mostly for pancakes and also as a substitute (out of laziness) for lard when making red bean paste.  I'm American, but my wife is Chinese and we cook mostly Chinese-ish.
3420 2018-10-14 23:52:18 Although, Leslie Stahl is really not falling for his spin and snake oil...She's upsetting him which I love. Ruffling his feathers.
3421 2018-10-14 23:52:13 We will dig our own oil, you grow your own food
3422 2018-10-14 23:52:10 Me too......& not really. I haven't had the chance to try the crate but she is still jumping up at night. I'm job searching right now & by about 1 PM I'm spent. Someone recommended CBD oil for Luna, maybe relax her more at night.
3423 2018-10-14 23:52:07 I want an oil diffuser
3424 2018-10-14 23:52:02 No one needs Saudi Arabia. Once we move off oil they will be left to rot.
3425 2018-10-14 23:51:56 Oil 2 minutes for crosschecking at 7:29 in 1st
3426 2018-10-14 23:51:55 Nigga think he slicka than some butter... BABY IM OIL
3427 2018-10-14 23:51:49 Love righteousness , hate wickedness , 

Oil of gladness ! Yippee !
3428 2018-10-14 23:51:46 No they will cut off the oil.  What would be interesting would be American reaction to $8.00 gas.
3429 2018-10-14 23:51:39 In regards to baking: why would you ever use oil when you can use browned butter?! I just spilled a little bit on the counter and I was tempted to lick it up, like I would have as a 7 year old.
3430 2018-10-14 23:51:39 Don't make the mistake of thinking he means anything with his words.  He's just parroting whatever talking points he's been given, in this case by the oil barons.  He literally means nothing; words are purely transactional to him.
3431 2018-10-14 23:51:38 i want jeff goldblum to ruin my life and drizzle baby oil on me
3432 2018-10-14 23:51:36 America's leadership is necessary.  left to the autocrats, the world will become a battle ground.  a medieval regime, w/ alot of oil, will lead us to a religious war ending in total destruction. this is not hyperbolic.  this threat is real. we are fighting for a modern world.
3433 2018-10-14 23:51:22 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
3434 2018-10-14 23:51:16 Trump thinks scientists that think man made climate change is real have political agendas but not the ones paid by the oil company's who say that it's not real. Unbelievable.
3435 2018-10-14 23:51:15 Who the hell told him climate could just go back? Oil companies? WTF?
3436 2018-10-14 23:50:57 oil your doors! lol
3437 2018-10-14 23:50:55 At least Scotland has oil and jolly good whiskey 
3438 2018-10-14 23:50:54 
3439 2018-10-14 23:50:54 Saudi Arabia is North Korea with oil.
3440 2018-10-14 23:50:48 US cann't be intimidated by Saudis. If this barbaric act goes unpunished it will encourage much more of the same perhaps even on US soil. US will just have to stomach: higher oil prices, no middle-east peace deal & no weapons sales. @realDonaldTrump should demand talks with King.
3441 2018-10-14 23:50:40 desi aunty oil massage
3442 2018-10-14 23:50:37 AND TOP BRASS OF @BJP4India is playing 'friendly' match with congress????

you have no SPINE<>
3443 2018-10-14 23:50:13 Previous Dem Congresses & Dem Presidents prohibited oil & gas exploration & production including fracking keeping supply down forcing prices up so everything costs more
3444 2018-10-14 23:50:12 This is very easy. 

Saute seasoned veggies you want in the ramen. 

When the fond develops on the bottom, add  2 cups vegetable broth. 2 cups is for one person. Scrape up the fond. 

Add 1tbsp soy sauce, 1tbsp sesame oil, 1tsp mirin, and 1tsp sake. Simmer for /1
3445 2018-10-14 23:49:53 Love ya Will, but your poor colon ..
3446 2018-10-14 23:49:48 It's probably 99% olive oil with some scent in it.
3447 2018-10-14 23:49:42 I bought $1 oil warmers and tea lights at Walmart and they’re so cute and they make our room smell soooooo good. I just hope Kaleb likes the smell of cinnamon rolls 
3448 2018-10-14 23:49:33 I don't want to lose millions and millions of dollars out of my pocket by putting restrictions on the oil and fuel industry remember I've got lots of stock in those big companies and if they tell me climate change is a hoax I'm going to listen. Donald J Trump what he's thinking
3449 2018-10-14 23:49:21 Canada has oil but oops, we’re a threat to your national security lmao 
3450 2018-10-14 23:49:20 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
3451 2018-10-14 23:49:09 So I just took a shower at this hour, combed my hair, applied beard oil, applied perfume, vaseline and hand lotion all at this hour. 
Yes I am going nuts. 
All this with no electricity. We are having power failure since 1AM.
3452 2018-10-14 23:49:09 There must be more to it then that, oil is less of an issue for America these days and there are many other countries with large reserves they can import from.

Though Petrodallor is probably the half of it.
3453 2018-10-14 23:48:56 That's break even on the entire government budget not the oil itself.Their actual break even is much lower
3454 2018-10-14 23:48:46 Garri and red oil 
3455 2018-10-14 23:48:26 They can eat their oil and money!
3456 2018-10-14 23:48:19 Okay, so, I have never liked pizza or pasta sauce.  On my pasta's I always go for some form of garlic butter type thing and on my pizza it's ether olive oil, garlic butter, or no sauce at all.
3457 2018-10-14 23:48:16 All that Arab/oil money about to stop coming in.
3458 2018-10-14 23:48:14 ほほぅ..( ◎ω◎)o[OIL]
3459 2018-10-14 23:48:12 Try an essential oil diffuser! Oil blends like eucalyptus, lemon, and peppermint work well! My allergist said that if you are going to do any kind of allergy medicine, a nose spray is the way to go. Also, try rubbing Vicks Vapor Rub on your feet then put socks on, It’s the best!!
3460 2018-10-14 23:48:05 Change a tire, lay down laminate floors, use a saw, change the oil, math, packing things into small spaces to save space.
3461 2018-10-14 23:47:49 What do you mean? You think every single oil drop on Earth will end up being used no matter what we do?
3462 2018-10-14 23:47:49 Bury him or bury me 
I’m the one who’s awful baby can’t you see
I ain’t got no oil reserves by the sea but
I’m helping to undermine democracy
I’m helping to undermine democracy...
3463 2018-10-14 23:47:34 The painting I said I was working on is still in the process it’s gonna be like maybe a week late cause oil paint dries SLOWLY. Hopefully it comes out nice cause I’m really not trying to rush it and make it look like ass
3464 2018-10-14 23:47:13 Ran out of characters... but I actually use a mixture of butter olive oil and rendered bacon fat
3465 2018-10-14 23:47:05 It's an aluminum engine (Cadillac northstar) with failed headgaskets, antifreeze in the oil and shot crank bearings (from the antifreeze). Not worth repairing the engine and new engine installed is like $3K. Got a better condition ride for $2500.
3466 2018-10-14 23:47:04 Don't we only get about 25% of our oil from Saudi ?  Frack more.  Off shore drill more.  Won't take much to make up the difference. Done.
3467 2018-10-14 23:46:57 Since the US imports only 9% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, they are merely knats buzzing.
3468 2018-10-14 23:46:54 Mostly for cooking fat if I’m not using olive oil and for pastries/cookies.
3469 2018-10-14 23:46:38 Oh. Yeah I’ll buy butter if a baking recipe specifically asks for it. If it’s just box mix though, I’ll just use an equivalent amount of oil instead. It does the job
3470 2018-10-14 23:46:29 It’s a devil’s bargain. We get oil we need to maintain a modern economy and support against our common enemies in the region: Iran, Syria, Russia, and islamists (besides Saudi-backed ones). They are a deplorable regime, though. Not sure what we can do with this one, though.
3471 2018-10-14 23:46:12 I have never tried artichoke that way.  How long & what temp did you roast it for?  Was that olive oil?
3472 2018-10-14 23:46:11 Ashok bhai, narender modi is dreaming to become "statesman". wait till he get thrown out in 2019.

WHAT A FAILURE MODI HAS BEEN.

TOTAL LET DOWN.
3473 2018-10-14 23:45:57 I assume that this doesn’t include the emissions from burning exported Tar Sands oil
3474 2018-10-14 23:45:57 how is it that every time I cook something, it always has 10x more oil on it than when my mum does
3475 2018-10-14 23:45:56 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
3476 2018-10-14 23:45:55 Congrats!!!
3477 2018-10-14 23:45:54 3. You have a Great Relationship with everyone- ALL FAKE. 
4. Will you do anything to Saudi?- No way. Oil Money.
3478 2018-10-14 23:45:54 I get it! I jog daily/1hr. Last month foot=lots of pain. Saw chiropractor 2x. Still worse, so saw orthopedic foot surgeon=plantar fasciitis. Special orthotics+oral steroids working! Active Rehab whole time in pain, ONLY possible cuz I rolled on @NaturesUltra CBD Oil
3479 2018-10-14 23:45:52 BTW, swap out the carrots for green pepper and the olive oil for butter and you have the base for Cajun cooking.
3480 2018-10-14 23:45:49 My hair got thick outa nowhere.... castor oil 
3481 2018-10-14 23:45:49 mommies with daughter what products do you use to oil you babies her ( my daughter only two months )
3482 2018-10-14 23:45:41 we have no real leadership, our votes are drowned completely out by oil soaked stacks of cash aimed at building wealth for corps through worldwide military sales and occupations--this is unsustainable
3483 2018-10-14 23:45:35 CBD oil helps ease the pain I have from a fractured knee. Highly recommend it.
3484 2018-10-14 23:45:35 #60Minutes Who is informing this guy on Climate Change? Could it possibly be those w/ #politicalagendas aka Big Oil? IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST!!! We must address our contributions to climate change NOW! Why is it an “agenda” to protect human health & safety?
3485 2018-10-14 23:45:25 I forget the race or even the year, but late in his career he had a diabolical wreck against the corner of a pit wall where it opens up to the garage, and it was so vicious it ruptured the oil sump. And he gets out and laments the loss of an outstanding hot rod.  

#Class
3486 2018-10-14 23:45:18 Why? To make the essential oil less strong
3487 2018-10-14 23:45:02 There's caesar dressing on the lettuce and then I added a bit of macadamia oil.
3488 2018-10-14 23:44:45 failure of @BJP4India is: It has go around like a DOG explaining all this...
3489 2018-10-14 23:44:43 Seems like a good time to pair it with kicking Saudi Arabia to the curb to end dependence on oil, etc...
3490 2018-10-14 23:44:31 I got to have chili fir dinner but I was forced to sit next to someone who smelled VERY strongly of oil and it ruined my appetite ,,
3491 2018-10-14 23:44:27 @SaudiEmbassyUSA  please sort out your shit so i dont have to pay 99 dollars a barrel for oil
3492 2018-10-14 23:44:13 My oil diffuser & lavender, smells heavenly
3493 2018-10-14 23:44:12 All the dudes at this Jiffy Lube are so chatty they accidentally gave me the synthetic oil without the upcharge.
3494 2018-10-14 23:44:09 Khashoggi’s disappearance, Trump’s clumsy bullying methods of diplomacy, and oil supplies in jeopardy. This is starting to look like the assassination of Austria’s Grand Duke that started WWI. #Trump will have to apologize or he’ll start WWIII. Which is more likely to happen?
3495 2018-10-14 23:44:03 Such FAKE NEWS Put out by @POTUS.  1. Says we are going to War with North Korea.- FAKE. North Korea does nothing without China Approval.
2. Does Not Believe in Global Change??- How can you not look at the world? Because you make money from Oil Companies.
3496 2018-10-14 23:44:03 oh. dear lord, how will you retaliate? Maybe some what higher oil prices? Spare me the pain.
3497 2018-10-14 23:44:00 Make a deal they can’t refuse. Free oil or else
3498 2018-10-14 23:43:54 That’s only because your trying to protect your market share and are 100% funded by oil.
3499 2018-10-14 23:43:45 Congrats to you and your team Megan.
3500 2018-10-14 23:43:42 I don’t think nature ever intended for birds to be coated with oil.
3501 2018-10-14 23:43:36 I really hate watching influencers drip oil all over their face. PLEASE, warm that ish up in your hands, and press it into your skin. You are making so much oil sit on your skin 
3502 2018-10-14 23:43:25 Much too kindly phrased, making 'MBS' sound at worst a bit gullible. I suggest a better phrasing is: The latest plutocrat-despot in the House of ibn Saud which, because of sheer acciental oil wealth promote terror and autocracy in the name of the fringe Islamic sect of Wahabbism.
3503 2018-10-14 23:43:21 How to PUNISH the Saudis is simple. Trump doesn't get it. But #WeThePeople know how to handle it. STOP BUYING SAUDI OIL. Period end of story. If that doesn't work, Freeze their U.S. assets. Cut off the money..but you won't because that affects you Trump.
3504 2018-10-14 23:43:13 yes I know you guys are very sensitive but the reality is no one cares cuz you don't have anything of value to trade with anybody. Well oil which is valuable but demonstrates you have nothing else to offer.
3505 2018-10-14 23:43:11 We strip our selves down, cover ourselves with oil and beat each other up
3506 2018-10-14 23:43:06 She ignoring me like I’m the change engine oil light
3507 2018-10-14 23:43:06 facial scrub made out of brown sugar, coconut oil, and crushed ibuprofen tablets will do wonders
3508 2018-10-14 23:42:53 Don't be ridiculous
3509 2018-10-14 23:42:45 You use a cotton ball and pour witch hazel and tea tree oil on it ?
3510 2018-10-14 23:42:37 Greedy Oppressive Pricks who adore Golf, Oil & Prostitutes over any so-called virtues they claim to uphold. It's akin to how the Mafia fused itself with the buzzwords of 'honor,' 'loyalty' and 'family' when in truth it's signifies murder, disease and destruction.
3511 2018-10-14 23:42:32 Start with a little hot water and sugar in the bottle of a blender. Dissolve. Then ripe melon, chopped chives, a little ice and some neutral oil. It's super simple, fresh and great with Verlasso salmon!
3512 2018-10-14 23:42:32 Scissors. For the pants I mean. Cut away the rest of the zipper and then use vegetable oil to slip the zipper off.
3513 2018-10-14 23:42:15 Saudi Arabia rhetoric may keep upward pressure on prices. Especially since we just came off of a $76 top. If things get any more heated we may have $80 #oil by the end of the week
3514 2018-10-14 23:42:03 Research scientists who get caught skewing data lose their careers.  Not so with oil company scientists.  THAT is the difference.
3515 2018-10-14 23:41:58 When Wall Street started shorting their own financial products, that was when it was all so obviously about oil.
3516 2018-10-14 23:41:56 Next time try butter instead of olive oil 
3517 2018-10-14 23:41:50 We need to stop worshipping at the altar of oil and start investing in other forms of energy. Government needs a plan to transition oil workers into other energy fields.
3518 2018-10-14 23:41:47 Alternatively it probably will not cause any interest until oil flows continuously via pipe to refinery. Meanwhile the downward spiral is likely to continue. Have you any idea of the production rate to support today's MCap????
3519 2018-10-14 23:41:43 They are reasonable concerns, though I don't share them as strongly as you and Tzeporah. I think innovation will help the oil sands hit their emissions targets. But this is something that reasonable people can debate and disagree about.
3520 2018-10-14 23:41:42 Doesn't matter. That goalie is terrible.
3521 2018-10-14 23:41:34 If they really believed the snake oil they sell wouldn't they 'teach'for free?the suppression, intolerance+ignorance coming from Harvard is shocking+absurd at the same time
3522 2018-10-14 23:41:34 With enough money may try to stop oil production indefinitely fall the market on Wednesday as a result of withdrawing their money
3523 2018-10-14 23:41:32 And the Saudis are threatening to nuke the US economy with $200 oil if he puts sanctions on them.
3524 2018-10-14 23:41:26 Get a Tesla... fuck oil! Its killing our planet!
3525 2018-10-14 23:41:23 LOL. wait, modi will pay for this 2019.
3526 2018-10-14 23:41:22 This is simply extortion. It's saying we hold the world at ransom with our oil and we do what please us. This sort of economic terrorism can not work in today's world. Justice, law, and human rights are principles that come first.
3527 2018-10-14 23:41:18 My aunt told us this story about her daughter in law giving birth last night. So my mom and i are just discussing it and she’s like “did i really need to hear the whole ‘well the doctor then got done fingering my daughter in law with olive oil’” i can’t stop crying
3528 2018-10-14 23:40:57 Back up a moment and provide some facts......you know......those inconvenient truths you shun. Define Alberta’s energy sector.......foreign, largely American oil companies allowed to have our oil and gas wealth in exchange for a few beads and a barrel of rum. Wake up People!!!!!
3529 2018-10-14 23:40:50 $AXAS Should have a + day on Monday because of Saudi issue in Turkey! It West sanctions them Oil will fly  WTI up .83
3530 2018-10-14 23:40:35 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
3531 2018-10-14 23:40:23 Is CTF directly paid by oil sands lobby?
3532 2018-10-14 23:40:19 Proof that we need to get off our dependence on oil ...
3533 2018-10-14 23:40:14 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
3534 2018-10-14 23:40:13 ที่ปารีสเค้าชอบให้ดอกกุหลาบหรอ อันนี้แค่สงสัย เพราะตอนนั้นที่เจนนี่ไปก็ได้ดอกกุหลาบ ครั้งนี้โฮไปก็ได้ดอกกุหลาบ
3535 2018-10-14 23:40:12 The universities get funded by the government!

The same way that the oil companies pay for their scientists.

One is not any more or less noble than the other!
3536 2018-10-14 23:39:57 wrong, we do need the oil. just saying
3537 2018-10-14 23:39:51 Surely one of the key reasons was the interest in moving to Oil & Nuclear. The funding moved accordingly under Thatcher at huge cost to communities that had built up on Coal production. Is this not one of the reasons we are so reliant on foreign oil and gas today?
3538 2018-10-14 23:39:45 Petroleum based products are usually a male staple. Maybe he needed oil for his car.
3539 2018-10-14 23:39:45 So you are basically saying that the only reason UK cares about Malvinas (which is 14000 kms away from UK) is the people. Not military reasons, not oil, not non-renewable energies... That's the hypocrite statement I've heard in years.
3540 2018-10-14 23:39:27 Further proof that the best thing we could do as a country is to get off our dependence on oil ...
3541 2018-10-14 23:39:26 Use a face oil!!!!!!!! My top recs are Juno by Sunday Riley or the gold colored one by Nyakio (I cant remember what it’s called rn)
3542 2018-10-14 23:39:18 We're at a thirty year low in dependence on foreign oil. They need us a lot more than we need them.
3543 2018-10-14 23:39:13 yes. nothing yummier than warm soggy watermelon with fry oil and bread.

mmmmmmm!
3544 2018-10-14 23:39:08 really  shiittttt and u called ur self a professor .. will tell us that when u don’t get oil anymore smart ass
3545 2018-10-14 23:39:04 Anyone watching @BBCWorld now? I'll be on around 8 pm ET to talk about the potential economic and oil impacts of the rising US-Saudi tensions over the Khashoggi incident #OOTT
3546 2018-10-14 23:39:03 If they're losing money on every barrel, why not quit producing for a while? The oil will still be there.
3547 2018-10-14 23:38:50 People at subway be like: put onions lettuce tomato olives green peppers salt pepper ranch bit of mayo oil spinach and toasted but thats it.
3548 2018-10-14 23:38:45 LUNATIC TRUMP & HIS LUNATIC SON-IN-LAW HAVE REALLY SCREWED AMERICA NOW...THIS ISSUE WITH SAUDIS MAY BE THE DEAL-BREAKER! LET'S BET...THAT TRUMP WILL BACK-OFF SANCTIONS TO SAVE THE PRICE OF OIL THAT WOULD SINK THE AMERICAN ECONOMY!!! OH YES...HE'S A WOOS...BIG TIME! BEND OVER USA!
3549 2018-10-14 23:38:30 Nope. Wait for the implosion.
3550 2018-10-14 23:38:29 1. Islam 
2. Oil
3551 2018-10-14 23:38:25 I'm assuming imposing sanctions on the Saudis will affect global oil prices seeing as they basically run OPEC. It is however highly unlikely that they'll suffer any sanctions. The US is in bed with the Saudis candy Trump doctrine shows no concern for human rights judging

3553 2018-10-14 23:38:24 US crude isn't as light & sweet & therefore as easy, cheap or desirable as what we import from the Middle East. We're spoiled & don't want to give up what we're spending for other stuff on oil, not desperate.

3556 2018-10-14 23:37:37 Iceland is honestly the unsung superhero of the supermarket world: a completely vegan range, affordable and removing palm oil from all of their products from 2019. I’m here for it
3557 2018-10-14 23:37:22 Baby oil will loosen them up to slide right off
3558 2018-10-14 23:37:22 And nobody will have health insurance!  And everyone will be food insecure!  And children will die of preventable diseases! But great! I get to be like an oil baron!
3559 2018-10-14 23:36:54 Go ahead, then try drinking oil. You will have no goods.
3560 2018-10-14 23:36:52 The world is a funny world. If the gov't finds diamond and oil in your backyard, it becomes the govt's property but when they find drugs, my brother it is your property. 

So said a friend this morning. God me thinking #morningmotivation
3561 2018-10-14 23:36:49 We don't respond due to oil and them buying weapons from us. Also it would come out that we are them and help them in the genocide of Yemen people. Saudi Arabia is terrible they great women like crap and spread extremism.
3562 2018-10-14 23:36:38 Wow. There is oil in other places and another reason why other forms of sustainable energy are necessary. That is blackmail.
3563 2018-10-14 23:36:28 The oil industry IMO is only in AB because of subsidy and low royalty rates. If the @YourAlberta changes anything they will walk. Everyone thinks the sky will fall if they walk. My feeling is let them walk. Let the sky fall. I'm curious if they will indeed walk.@JustinTrudeau
3564 2018-10-14 23:36:23 You are obviously ignorant n have no clue what you are talking about.

KSA is an important ally for multiple reasons. E.g to control oil price n put pressure on Russia & Iran.
KSA are also head of the strongest alliance in the Middle East.

What professor are you?
Gender studies?
3565 2018-10-14 23:36:01 keep the drive alive. 

leave nothing left in the engine. 

change the oil. use your mechaincs in an effective manner, or they will try to overcharge you. 

and unlike in the real world, money can't fix these mistakes. it is only your time that will be lost.
3566 2018-10-14 23:35:56 Stir fry it in butter, olive oil and garlic.  It's the only way I like it.
3567 2018-10-14 23:35:50 He didn't promise to get us out. Afghanistan also isn't oil rich once so ever, so that conspiracy theory falls flat. Lol what? Yes, the Taliban and Al Qaeda should end their war, as they kill the VAST majority of civillians in Afghanistan
3568 2018-10-14 23:35:49 They'll just have to convert all aircraft to use recycled vegetable oil for fuel. The vegans are going to need to eat a more lot of french fries, but it's totally sustainable...
3569 2018-10-14 23:35:35 i’ve been using bio oil for 3 days why the FUCK am i not beautiful yet
3570 2018-10-14 23:35:20 We don’t need no stinking oil!  But you sand fuckers need food. And we have it.
3571 2018-10-14 23:35:18 You don't understand. 9/11 was done at the direction of Israel. Therefore, the Saudi perpetrators are as exempt from criticism as those who planned and ordered the attack to facilitate the enslavement of the population of Iraq and the stealing of their oil.
3572 2018-10-14 23:35:16 No one is going to do anything @RachelNotley is a puppet like the other leaders. I mean I understand why. After gambling revenues the oil industry gives us the next source of cash. But we are giving away our kids' environment and planet for the present cash. Is this right?
3573 2018-10-14 23:35:12 Boil it, then olive oil, salt and pepper (maybe a little Yuzu hot sauce), or use in soup.
3574 2018-10-14 23:35:08 More power. If you like to have peoples’ hands cut off. And he’s got oil.
3575 2018-10-14 23:35:04 Aint no butter or oil to grease my pan with .
3576 2018-10-14 23:35:02 I literally just tried to make orange dilute with fucking cooking oil. Why do I keep the two bottles beside each other?
3577 2018-10-14 23:35:01 乾燥の季節になったの指先の逆剥けで気付いた…oil塗らないと(´Д｀)
3578 2018-10-14 23:34:59 Umm because scientist being paid by the oil industry have an incentive to skew data to serve the agenda of the oil industry.
3579 2018-10-14 23:34:46 @LaBeautyologist what does oil cleansing help with for oily acne prone skin?
3580 2018-10-14 23:34:45 Update : I got a oil diffuser for Desiree and I’s room and it smells fucking magical
3581 2018-10-14 23:34:38 2 hours to pick and clean the leaves of 12 collard greens plants.

2 hours to cook 12 stuffed giant collard green leaves. (rice, ground beef, mild spices, shredded carrots, onion, garlic; stuffed into a leaf and fried in a titch of olive oil)

3 of these were a sizable meal.
3582 2018-10-14 23:34:25 Oil paintings dry out and crack: criminal mischief? “The banana you sold me rotted!” Who determines how to characterize property in absence of express complete description by the artist? Mistake of fact as to changing nature of property might void a sale but not likely mischief.

3584 2018-10-14 23:33:51 @10DowningStreet @cabinetofficeuk @foreignoffice We're going to have to go "all out" against the Saudis now. Forget the arms contracts, forget the oil money, forget the economy. Time's Up @DefenceHQ

3586 2018-10-14 23:33:17 If democrats win in November we’ll need their oil more than ever.
3587 2018-10-14 23:33:05 Saudi technology is years above the US unfortunately. This will be a tough sanction regardless esp with oil.
3588 2018-10-14 23:32:57 I’m sorry but Britney’s only purpose was to sing I’m A slave 4 u she could have disappeared into a one hit wonder right after and I wouldn’t be mad. The Neptunes did the work of god on that track 18 years later and I still have the goal to oil myself up and dance with a snake

3590 2018-10-14 23:32:46 S.A. may generate $161 billion just from oil just this year.  They currently have $800 billion in American investments.  You're talking about the equivalent of a few pennies one time on the average American pay check.  Threaten their assets & to cut them loose for real impact Sen
3591 2018-10-14 23:32:40 good evening fast-paced friends allow us to combine sugar, salt, all-purpose flour, canola oil and active dry YEAST into a rising, edible amalgamation dating back to ancient egypt, then gain access to said entity so as to affirm our self worth and flaunt prosperity
3592 2018-10-14 23:32:40 Well this one the charger port stopped working and the other ones the oil burned it out
3593 2018-10-14 23:32:40 I see.  Who funds the universities?  The gvt, right?  

So the universities are not any less biased than the oil companies.
3594 2018-10-14 23:32:20 Wow, nice kick in the groin to teachers. Guess @WBrettWilson just had enough of wealthy teachers bullying poor oil companies around.
3595 2018-10-14 23:32:07 Ahh, fair enough. There are omega-3 supplements made from krill oil offered as an alternative to fish oil, and I think of them as "whale food".

3598 2018-10-14 23:32:03 It tastes salty and mellow, and  so Chicken oil and Miso soup make mellow taste.
3599 2018-10-14 23:31:58 Pour a cap of cooking oil on that croaking mf
3600 2018-10-14 23:31:57 That looks good. I did Brussel sprouts with Traeger Prime Rib rub cooked in a pan with oil and butter. Also did the reverse sear method with some NY strip steaks. Good stuff.
3601 2018-10-14 23:31:51 The effect of shahed and oil on patwaris
3602 2018-10-14 23:31:41 It's not about religion at all for Trump, it's about money. Well, yes, he's still racist but if a Saudi King has enough money for you to overlook that in an oil rich country, then he can set aside his prejudice for oligarchs.
3603 2018-10-14 23:31:33 Mr.  West, you may want to check where Cruz’s PAC money comes from- and in like Beto who doesn’t accept PAC money- you may be surprised!  Cruz is pretty much owned by banks and oil companies.  He get very little from actual people- I mean people that aren’t corps
3604 2018-10-14 23:31:28 I've eaten grits on toast with fried eggs (not oil fried, the style of egg called fried), with bacon and jam. Sometimes biscuits instead of toast. At least we're not Britain, with their Toast Sandwiches.
3605 2018-10-14 23:31:14 Do you know of any Nobel prize winning research done for oil companies?
3606 2018-10-14 23:31:14 So when the oil runs out and the wealth is gone, trump and others won’t give 2 shits about this place and corrupt “govt”. They murder they’re own ppl and been caught....we should cut any ties. US needs to become energy independent.
3607 2018-10-14 23:31:10 Diced celery makes a nice salad bar with olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Throw in tiny shrimp if you must.
3608 2018-10-14 23:31:05 I mix plain Greek yogurt with olive oil, basil, garlic powder and sometimes roasted red pepper seasoning. Life will never be the same thereafter.
3609 2018-10-14 23:31:03 Same. I use olive oil sometimes too—but butter is Queen.
3610 2018-10-14 23:30:59 I need an oil change, off day me please 
3611 2018-10-14 23:30:54 it is failure of @narendramodi  Modi is the PM. if such big institutes fail like Courts, ED, CBI, etc. then it is directly his failure.

3620 2018-10-14 23:29:55 Keep on burning oil. I’ll prepare for the 6th extinction.
3621 2018-10-14 23:29:44 Stable oil markets & oil priced and traded in US $ are a product of the US’s long standing relationship with SA. US national security and prosperity have depended on this arrangement.  Delicate balancing is needed, not simple knee-jerk emotional responses.
3622 2018-10-14 23:29:40 I doubt ts s related to te murdered #US journalists by #SaudiArabia , it must b related to oil disagreement
3623 2018-10-14 23:29:30 Vitamin C is good. Black seed oil should be replaced with coconut or vitamin E
3624 2018-10-14 23:29:29 Politicians are pushing that there is no climate change because they have motif and dreams of big oil money supporters for their super pacts and campaigns.
3625 2018-10-14 23:29:18 To be stopped. Enough is enough. Fuck the oil. Let’s be heading for a free world
3626 2018-10-14 23:29:17 I dunno, maybe investing in clean energy will make us less dependent on Saudi oil?
3627 2018-10-14 23:29:03 University scientists must publish through refereed journals.   Their methods and results are heavily scrutinized.  That’s what makes science so powerful.

Oil company scientists?  Not exactly unbiased don’t you think?
3628 2018-10-14 23:28:57 Saudia Arabia has been in the background of the US for a lonnnnnnng time. Oil and all.
3629 2018-10-14 23:28:56 Lol yeah I’m still lit got the oil in me too
3630 2018-10-14 23:28:53 Bring it on. We don’t need their oil.
3631 2018-10-14 23:28:34 I wish someone could come and get my car , get an oil change , wash it and get new tires and I’ll pay for it all 
3632 2018-10-14 23:28:27 Of course where you slipped the oil is a different matter! 
3633 2018-10-14 23:28:20 you can't call yourself a grill master if you use lighter fluid and coal, that shit doesn't smell right

it's all about that mesquite and recycled canola oil
3634 2018-10-14 23:28:02 Polling is a snake oil salesman’s business at best and really is as relevant as encyclopedias and rotary phones. The Trump campaign knew they’d won the day before through digital signals. This is the future of polling and @NateSilver538 made reference to @UpshotNYT as an example
3635 2018-10-14 23:28:01 Doesn't matter. SA turns off 10mbd all oil prices will spike regardless of source. Oil is fungible
3636 2018-10-14 23:27:45 It's a hundred percent like oil and water it won't mix even in a blender
3637 2018-10-14 23:27:41 They look real cool but they're an actual pain in the ass to maintain since ya know you're submerging everything in mineral oil
3638 2018-10-14 23:27:39 I am plant based with no oil, dairy or sugar. Tasty meals that are fun to create and no more diabetes! If only our governments would promote and incentivize these types of meals, we would be healthier, save on cost of health care and help the environment.
3639 2018-10-14 23:27:30 Oil is up already too. This will be ugly in no time.
3640 2018-10-14 23:27:20 A nigga coolin smokin oil out tha G pen .yall lookin fa bud we not tha same
3641 2018-10-14 23:27:18 Who was the last president to get tough with the Saudis? Had to be pre oil days!
3642 2018-10-14 23:27:12 They've certainly gotten rich off of oil and are a prime producer of oil, but they're not the only countries that are a part of OPEC with oil to sell.
3643 2018-10-14 23:27:00 Buy Canadian energy—-not Saudi blood oil.
3644 2018-10-14 23:26:57 I wouldn't drink a concoction of unknown snake oil I've been offered on Facebook to cure a hangover.
3645 2018-10-14 23:26:49 Saudi Arabia has always been a shady player on the world stage the only thing they have is oil need to keep your eyes on Australia 20 trillion dollars worth of oil and natural gas game-changer still in the background
3646 2018-10-14 23:26:48 it smells like coconut/tropical as well so it’s no pure beefy scent, a got the medium one cos a was v scared to go with dark incase a fucked it up but it still gives u a good colour! i also got the bronze shimmer body oil to put on over it n it makes u so glowy  ur v welcome
3647 2018-10-14 23:26:25 Eastern Canada is still importing Saudi oil which makes us living in western Canada wonder whether the liberals in Ottawa prefer it that way. Justin keeps saying how we need to help other Canadians because " that's what Canadians do". Really!

3650 2018-10-14 23:25:51 Two things: I questioned the olive oil for the recipe..but the acidity of the tamarind balances it out--much like vinaigrette.

I only had EVOO tho next time I'd go regular or vegetable oil. Small OO after taste. 

Also, the dates take forever to chop. Sticky and quite a workout
3651 2018-10-14 23:25:42 Sometimes one side are hacks paid by oil & coal billionaires to lie through their teeth defending fossil fuel profits while ice caps melt, Australia bakes, California burns, the Caribbean basin floods & millions of refugees are driven from their homes. This is one of those times.

• Use Essential oils
•Apply Green Tea to the Skin 
•Moisturize With Aloe Vera.            • wash face regularly.                          • change pillow case every week

Went to work. Computers down.
Went to work. Two call ins.

It’s the worlds payback for me not being able to be around tomorrow

3661 2018-10-14 23:24:26 Add that there are now 500,000 barrels per day of oil going to China from the USA. At $70+ per bbl.

3663 2018-10-14 23:24:04 No one is accountable. The bigwigs get big compensation at AER. The taxpayers always pay. Polluters walk and oil industry delays remediation costs into the future where they can walk. Nice set up with full cooperation of all political parties. @albertaNDP @jkenney @Alberta_UCP
3664 2018-10-14 23:24:03 oh he’s arab af he loves olive oil???
3665 2018-10-14 23:23:38 Do you think  the shale oil can competing the regular oil without increasing the price. If you have good memory. Do you remember what happened to shale oil when the market when down to 40$? The price wil go up and up. USA can replace 1 or 2 or 4 million barrels not 12 million.
3666 2018-10-14 23:23:36 I went from watching makeup tutorials on YouTube to how to change your car oil to a priest doing an exorcism  i think its time for me to go to bed

3670 2018-10-14 23:23:03 I got my favorite jacket covered in oil :////// nothing is working to fix it
3671 2018-10-14 23:23:03 Gas lines like the '70s oil embargo.  Market will fix this with evil gas stations implementing more EV charging, but of course, what does the buyer of a 100k car want more than a free fill-up?
3672 2018-10-14 23:22:58 I’m so pissed I wanted to make Halloween cupcakes but I have no vegetable oil now I gotta wait!
3673 2018-10-14 23:22:55 Saudi Sovereign Fund owns 3-5 % Of Tesla, then they kill Khashoggi with an Apple Watch on, sanctions to follow, then high oil prices then high electric vehicle sales. Do the math.
3674 2018-10-14 23:22:40 Do you put the burger on a sliced Krispy Creme donut, or is the donut the burger?
3675 2018-10-14 23:22:37 You would never do that as long as they have the oil. You are greedy and need the money.
3676 2018-10-14 23:22:24 What does some random carpetbagger selling snake oil have to do with "economics"?
3677 2018-10-14 23:22:15 Hasten sounds benign cos, as a surfactant oil, relatively it is. Use of it means less of any chemicals are then required, possibly fewer chemicals too.

3683 2018-10-14 23:21:40 Stop giving away our oil. How about the national energy board do their fucking job and step in to force companies to use their booked capacity instead of shipping "air barrels" on Enbridges mainline.  Disgraceful!!!!
3684 2018-10-14 23:21:39 It is what snake oil salesman do, invent an imaginary condition, than offer a cure, at a price.
3685 2018-10-14 23:21:36 Oddly enough this volatile market does not prohibit the oil industry from making major profits while Albertans lose their jobs and don't complain about the "volatility" business. So not so volatile IMO.
3686 2018-10-14 23:21:36 U.S. should have dumped the Saudis long ago (9-11, etc.). I've long favored Iran over them. Pre-1953 (CIA installation of Shah) Iranian people loved US. Truman resisted Britain's efforts to make us complicit in oil grab. 1979 revolution was result of Ike's cave-in to Britain.
3687 2018-10-14 23:21:34 Nothing like a Saudi Official "threatening" to use Oil as a weapon to goose prices.
3688 2018-10-14 23:21:31 Not realizing it I just poured red wine over my vegetables instead of olive oil  this will be an interesting twist in stir fry 
3689 2018-10-14 23:21:29 That sounds really good :) I love mozzarella, especially the ones stored in oil with herbs!
3690 2018-10-14 23:21:28 My pt is merely that lower oil prices will hurt US more

3692 2018-10-14 23:21:02 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news. @Fraser_brad

3694 2018-10-14 23:20:49 Trump consented to sale of largest Oil Refinery in U.S. to Saudi Arabia. SA owns & controls the crown jewel in U.S. Refinery System- Port Arthur. Of course they can threaten & retaliate against U.S for imposing Magintsky Sanctions.
3695 2018-10-14 23:20:45 How big is the U.K. oil fund Dan?
3696 2018-10-14 23:20:37 I ordered CBD oil and I hope it’s delivered to my apartment soon. I’m tired of being stressed the fuck out all the time. (I promise you that I’m seriously not exaggerating.) I couldn’t even enjoy a weekend away from work.
3697 2018-10-14 23:20:35 It's goodbye coconut oil hello shea nut butter season
3698 2018-10-14 23:20:35 I was sick on a job in the oil patch all by myself about 40 miles from nowhere. Was swarmed by hundreds of bees. I was so sick, I just stood still and they landed all over me,,, never stung me. A surreal moment, almost magical. Sounds a little crazy. Maybe was my after shave.
3699 2018-10-14 23:20:32 $200 oil all day long

3707 2018-10-14 23:18:41 bbs it’s 100% castor oil, you can prob get it even cheaper at a drugstore. will deffff buy tomorrow i’ll keep y’all posted (and keep me posted too lolol)
3708 2018-10-14 23:18:35 I used to try a lot of stuff n now I don't use anything at all on my face. Not even soap. My skin is better than ever now n not as oily as is used to be. It took a while to get used to but u should seriously try it for a mnth n see how it works n I put unrefined coconut oil after

3718 2018-10-14 23:17:35 Bet! Especially for this oil show
3719 2018-10-14 23:17:27 Big oil runs our congress.
3720 2018-10-14 23:17:27 Media is trying to divide us out of spite. Turkeys Lira was dropping and they want out of the sanctions. They pretend to be partners with the Saudis, then make these allegations with nothing but a video of him going in. Saudi runs OPEC. How many of these 2 actors invested in oil?
3721 2018-10-14 23:17:12 I don't know. You would have to ask AER folks. Good luck with that as the AER is essentially the front office of big oil and I kind of doubt it's very productive. Nice spin though.
3722 2018-10-14 23:17:12 Shanghai oil futures is a form to promote the yuan and to create an Asian benchmark. What does it have to do with oil demand-supply ? Or do you think that oil prices will now crash as there is another way to speculate on it ?? Are you this dumb ?
3723 2018-10-14 23:17:07 Wasps do not like peppermint oil....
3724 2018-10-14 23:16:22 you can use baby oil to get it off if you don’t like it that much, also the superdrug own brand mousse tan is the first one i ever tried n it never goes streaky or patchy n its so cheap as well n they do 3 for 2 so it’s decent if u wanna practise more with that!
3725 2018-10-14 23:16:21 Nutshell: Discovery of oil led to wealth falling into the hands of a few, kleptocracy, destabilization, conflict, war. Saudis have always tampered in Yemen's politics & are now destroying this beautiful place with the excuse of subverting terrorism. Sickening.
3726 2018-10-14 23:16:21 HAHAHA

Scotland generates vast excess today for no financial benefit - if rUK not buying, we reduce generation and stop supply to save money.

3730 2018-10-14 23:15:58 Cue the video: “He’s a scammer, a snake oil salesman,con man, a Carny, a flimflam man,!”

Romney always thought he was smarter than Trump. And our main man @POTUS just lapped all these Never T dawgs.

Romney owes him a public apology, like his erroneous public take down attempt.

3736 2018-10-14 23:15:39 Pretty sure they weren’t doing oil changes at the Metro store.
I’m not saying I’m opposed, just questioning the assessment done. I’ve seen the remediation needed at garages in the past and it can be significant. This area drains into a flood plain and ultimately our water table.

3744 2018-10-14 23:14:57 You should check out aurora. They have the best compassionate pricing for low income patients of any of the LPs I've found at $6/g though their selection isn't always the greatest...

CannaFarms is organic, no comp. pricing but their shake is $1.75/g that I use for making oil.
3745 2018-10-14 23:14:56 Go back to the Middle Ages and take a bath in your oil while you are at it.
3746 2018-10-14 23:14:53 white wine tastes like watered down olive oil
3747 2018-10-14 23:14:43 For the moment there is no sign that China will stop stockpiling oil so again you are chasing another mirage. It will still take years for China to reach the level of the US SPR.
3748 2018-10-14 23:14:42 Well US has built oil reserves just for this kind of situation.They will drill in alaska .As for the rest its a loss for the saudis
3749 2018-10-14 23:14:34 Cbd oil is a little more helpful than anything I’ve tried to relax my mind
3750 2018-10-14 23:14:28 Oh yes
3751 2018-10-14 23:14:17 The woman in this HomeChef commercial really just said that she likes the box service because without it she never knew how much oil to use in a recipe. I’m starting to think all of that hate that people have for us millennials is warranted.
3752 2018-10-14 23:13:54 Can't say I'm *quite* ready for it, but did order oil and buy some thick fuzzy socks.

3757 2018-10-14 23:13:25 6of10: In my Jan.1989 op-ed I quoted RFK's response to Peruvian radicals who believed America's super-rich (eg. the Rockefellers) controlled U.S. politics&would prevent Peru from nationalizing their oil. Bobby told them: "Oh come on! In America we eat Rockefellers for breakfast."
3758 2018-10-14 23:13:19 1/2. Ok

UK as whole can self-sustain own ‘critical supply’, thereby does not cede political ‘strength’ internationally. After Scot Indy, rUK loses ALL oil & gas (rUK majority generation is Gas & Nuclear).  They would have to buy all gas from France/Russia if not us... 2/2
3759 2018-10-14 23:13:15 He's bluffing...he can price his oil at whatever he wants. We don't need it. Have everything needed in the continent and I'd bet we can drain Venezeula if needed.
3760 2018-10-14 23:13:11 Looking to week ahead - 

Will likely stay focused again on $BABA $DIS - main holdings here

$BAC - tomorrow AM. Will be impt to see the financials come back soon 

Oil - Trump wants low oil but fresh red lines with Saudis now. Not going to help. 
3761 2018-10-14 23:13:08 Let me answer your questions in turn. Most Western nations keep a strategic oil reserve for an emergency. China has been building its reserves for years and it is still about one third smaller than the US while they are the largest importer in the globe.

3763 2018-10-14 23:12:58 Saudi Arabia is too used to being handled with kid gloves. They can shut all their taps, and oil won't go to $200. The fuckers killed the golden goose, made it too profitable for too long to do shale and tar sands, etc.

What US should do is boycott Saudi oil entirely.
3764 2018-10-14 23:12:39 Hello! What are we doing about climate change? No coal,no gasoline. New laws to phase them out. Saudis and oil companies goodbye!
3765 2018-10-14 23:12:29 Ya well, 1/2 the provincial party wanted to rid oil sands the day after the election and the Federal @NDP has their wagon hitched to a team of unicorns.
3766 2018-10-14 23:12:26 Very curious your guys thoughts on where Lucic actually fits on this team and in this new NHL
3767 2018-10-14 23:12:21 Last I saw we get 90% of our imported oil from Canada/Mexico. Unless they can get the rest of OPEC to join them, I don't think they'll hurt themselves much more than they can hurt us.
3768 2018-10-14 23:12:05 I had endless oil. I ain’t wait in line for shitt. Except for that grilled chicken.
3769 2018-10-14 23:12:04 Yeah, it's like mixing mashed potatoes with oil, hardening them into a mold with preservatives and calling it a potato
3770 2018-10-14 23:12:04 Amen.Truth is this free shit is ridiculously unfair. Free rent food oil phone car insurance healthcare...on and on
3771 2018-10-14 23:12:01 Is these mosquito bites don't kill me, the smell of tea tree oil definitely will
3772 2018-10-14 23:11:57 Serious. The CIA spent years getting America leaning operators in the oil fields to temper Saudi Arabia's influence on the world.
3773 2018-10-14 23:11:53 @DeltaSonicWash 10/13 went to Engine oil change for my 2015 Subaru forester,  mechanic flushed out  transmission oil and just pathetic experience.  If something goes wrong with my car I'm gonna take action. Naperville, IL
3774 2018-10-14 23:11:49 Looks like anyone who was already short this market in size isn’t going to run for cover that easily given relatively low risk of Saudi launching an oil war... even if the risk is asymmetric. Though guess that could change
3775 2018-10-14 23:11:49  Oil and gas. (There were worse problems.)
3776 2018-10-14 23:11:47 Let them cut off oil to America. Our oil is better any way.
3777 2018-10-14 23:11:40 I'd be fine with Lucic being moved and Yamamoto swapping to the other side. Could be a disaster in their own end but Milan is non-existent in the d-zone so not a big difference.
3778 2018-10-14 23:11:27 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
3779 2018-10-14 23:11:24 Don't worry. Our western crude will still bring 20 bucks so... we won't have to feel guilty about dirty oil money.
3780 2018-10-14 23:11:21 Gotta love all these guys!! Tweeting away in there 4G Abacuses, bitching about oil and gas?? I’m sure there all riding donkeys to work tomorrow to??
3781 2018-10-14 23:11:13 If we have electric cars we don’t need their oil. They can stick their oil up their Saudi murdering ass but @realDonaldTrump and Jared are into the murdering Prince bigley

3791 2018-10-14 23:10:05 By the time they approve TransMountain, Canada will be so far behind on pipeline capacity that we better reopen the discussions on the Northern Gateway pipeline now too. Especially since they’ve approved the LNG pipeline. Use the opportunity to build an oil pipeline beside it.
3792 2018-10-14 23:09:59 Meat is tiny compared to energy and oil. The bigger question is why aren't politicians going after the industries that have the highest impact? Meat is a cop out. Easy target.

It means we can produce Tar-Sands oil again and break even, maybe make a bit of money.

do we install a democracy ?
or do we install a theocracy ?

who will guarantee us and our allies the oil contracts .....
3808 2018-10-14 23:08:32 I'd love to try oil as-well. For me sativa helps when I've got a shitty mood and I need to work with costumers. Indica is more of a creative juice, sitting at home and doing hobby stuff, or reading\watching something.
3809 2018-10-14 23:08:27 Been wanting to swap Puljujarvi and Yamamoto the last game or so. Think I mentioned that to you the other day too
3810 2018-10-14 23:08:19 I sell on oil that can go over all your body and it lasts forever. Dm me if you are interested.
3811 2018-10-14 23:08:17 Almost none of our oil comes from SA. Why do they get to control the prices?
3812 2018-10-14 23:07:52 Brothers, ask yourselves who profits by Khashoggi's death, KSA? Tell me how. But a KSA/USA alliance, $110B in state of the art weapons & a de facto oil cartel made up of the worlds 2 largest producers all favors KSA. NO WAY they risk all that chopping a guy up in their consulate
3813 2018-10-14 23:07:43 UNREAL ! SAUDIS kill with IMPUNITY in #YemenGenocide , crucify, behead women and men in Saudi Arabia USA says  NOTHING ! Obama partnered with MBS for war in #Yemen ..NOTHING said !  SAUDI OIL has USA ...by the BALLS , but kills a descenting journalist...USA PRETENDS OUTRAGE !
3814 2018-10-14 23:07:13 it's good! Make sure to pat the chickpeas dry before adding all the oil and seasonings, helps them get crispy!
3815 2018-10-14 23:07:07 what’s a carrier oil? like regular oils??
3816 2018-10-14 23:07:00 Umm we do not import much saudi oil if any.  We are independent of opec oil imports.
3817 2018-10-14 23:06:59 The #UnitedStates can't allow #SaudiArabia strong-arm it.
The U.S has plenty of options to hurt Saudi Arabia also but the Saudis have a strong powerful advantage when it comes to oil. The #UnitedStates could push for an agreement.

3819 2018-10-14 23:06:36 Scheer lives in a weird dream-world where he really believes our oil can be extracted, transported and sold to India as cheaply as the oil from Indonesia.
3820 2018-10-14 23:06:30 I think a good oil is a good oil to be honest!
3821 2018-10-14 23:06:11 Ha, you also embargoed us. Don't forget that help with those terrible Communists, and continued help with Iran. How convenient you don't bring up those issues. Oil is also an old game, and when 30-40% of all cars are EVs it will be less impressive an less profitable. Good luck
3822 2018-10-14 23:06:11 A Saudi threat to push oil to $200/barrel might have caused serious waves in the 1970s global economy. Thanks to diversification of energy sources, including renewables, the same empty words in 21st century will hurt the Saudis more than anyone else. #OOTT
3823 2018-10-14 23:06:09 Soon Oil will be the second serious game. The world largest economy, companies and banks will be the first. If not the US then China .
Set calm, watch and try to figure out this equation.

3830 2018-10-14 23:05:33 As far as I remember you asked US for help and started to sell oil in USD...
3831 2018-10-14 23:05:29 Let them. We have oil. Lots of it.
3832 2018-10-14 23:05:18 You seem to know very little about the oil industry.  Raising oil prices will only drive the US to activate shale oil fields ( higher production costs would become profitable). Sure you could stop selling oil, but you cant just “raise” prices. Prices follow supply and demand.

3834 2018-10-14 23:05:10 It seems like a potentially better version of flaxseed oil. It is also naturally high in vitamin E (which works as an antioxidant in oils to protect against peroxidation,) so it should have better oxidative stability. I'd prefer EVOO/coconut oil for cooking still though.
3835 2018-10-14 23:05:07 Trump’s gonna be able to pay his bills no matter what. The rest of us using gasoline & home heating oil; not so much
3836 2018-10-14 23:04:52 It's actually real cheese that's been ground up into tiny particles, mixed with oil and then poured into molds and hardened into "slices"
3837 2018-10-14 23:04:49 It's our oil up here In Scotland that's why we want independence to get what Norway has .
3838 2018-10-14 23:04:36 It’s just the whole culture of pseudoscience that gets me. So many people being brainwashed into not treated their medical conditions appropriately.

3844 2018-10-14 23:03:30 no one has done more damage to the US economically like we did in the 70’s. 
What we can do:
Buy arms from Russia/China
Have oil skyrocket to $200-$300
Sell oil in Yuan not USD
3845 2018-10-14 23:03:21 Obama rebuilt the economy trashed by republicans criminal illegal war and unauthorized occupations for oil. Trump's numbers continued but slowed that progress. Reality means nothing to Trump supporters. They prefer alternative facts.  #ImpeachTrump

3862 2018-10-14 23:01:15 You might not believe this people from the before times, but we not only didn't get the free oil (or even decrease our dependence on it) but the Orange Menance cowered to Saudi Arabia when things got rough because owed them money. Alaska has palm trees now so whatevs.
3863 2018-10-14 23:01:10 Yes I do. So do you & every other Canadian because #TMX is owned by the federal gov't. 

Everyone has an interest to ensure it's properly utilized. 

Would you prefer the world's oil come from environmental pariahs like Nigeria & Venezuela?
3864 2018-10-14 23:00:49 Now everyone has hard feelings over a ridiculous agreement: "They believed that because she signed on to the agreement – support for emissions reduction policies in exchange for no limits to oil sands production – she also signed on to support new pipelines."

3884 2018-10-14 22:59:13 If I’m to understand this right, taking the article and statements on face value. The Saudis can do ANYTHING with impunity regardless of what the world thinks because MOST nations are reliant on it either for oil or money. My take, lay with the devil and this is the result.

3914 2018-10-14 22:54:44 Hate to break it to you, but the US has its own oil reserves. We haven’t used gulf oil since the Iraq war inflated costs.
3915 2018-10-14 22:54:38 Pls @me when you get an answer.
The oil on my face can fry a bunch of plantain. It's annoying.
3916 2018-10-14 22:54:36 Let me see!!!!
Global warming used for excuse of the truth that we have been running out of oil, then all this crap starts happening and next I can see another war on the way.
Something stinks here.
3917 2018-10-14 22:54:22 Saudis are completely reliant on imports. They have one natural resource. If we impose sanctions, they will switch quickly to Russia. We produce enough oil to supply ourselves. I don't actually see much downside..
3918 2018-10-14 22:54:21 The idea that the US is dependent on oil from Saudi Arabia (or any other middle eastern country) for oil is a myth. The US gets most of its oil domestically. The largest foreign exporter of oil by far is Canada then it’s Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia at fourth.
3919 2018-10-14 22:53:58 The USA will only subsidise EVs when foreign oil runs out. It's all about the end game to them. Keep the world thirsty until the only oil remaining is our oil. Then the price skyrockets, and we own the world. Sad news alert, we will all be dead by then. Want change? #VotePresent!
3920 2018-10-14 22:53:51 Yea right. Saudis can’t even run their own country without massive help from expats in every area of the economy. This after almost a century of vast oil wealth.
3921 2018-10-14 22:53:48 Aren't we getting all our oil from Russia now?
3922 2018-10-14 22:53:35 Also don’t attempt to load a ton of wood into the shed in one go with a torn knee. I feel like I just rusted up and there’s no light oil for use inside humans..  except maybe opioids?!  Alcohol!
3923 2018-10-14 22:53:27 Saudi is in no position to dictate. They have oil, for now

3926 2018-10-14 22:52:56 Let’s not get bogged down in details here.  I’m meeting with the movers and shakers in Midland, Texas next week.   Oil stuff.  Just let them know you know me and I’m sure they will allow you to litigate up there.  It’s going to be cold out there too.  I’m packing gloves.

3929 2018-10-14 22:52:53 Imagine, you came to our land, destroyed our land just cause you want to explore oil. You contaminated our fresh clean water and soil in the process, which we depend on for our livelihood. And worst of all you don’t share the cake with us.  Hell on earth

3933 2018-10-14 22:52:34 usa has cynically supported ksa for decades in exchange for oil policy.  Now the world needs us to lighten up on fossil fuels.  People who never used them are getting hit by climate change.  We don't need ksa and have no reason to support their genocide.

3946 2018-10-14 22:51:08 Saudi stocks plunge and we're watching oil today as Trump considers action on missing journo; plus we're wrapping a big @BloombergTV weekend in Bali:
- BOJ's Kuroda exclusive
- PBOC's Yi Gang speaks exclusively to our print colleagues
- IMF MD Lagarde
- Bank of Indonesia Gov
3947 2018-10-14 22:51:02 Only in USA with Trump and Kushner that's taking it from behind by he Saudis. Trump is selling all Americana to other countries for his own wallet. USA now produces more oil than ever and still depends on others...can't wait when they will be out...
3948 2018-10-14 22:51:01 No problem here, eastern Arabia with the oil reserves wants independence and freedom anyways. Saudis are bluffing....
3949 2018-10-14 22:50:51 1. Hardly. 2. USA can produce all oil it uses. This hits only to EU. 3. Happening already and it helps mostly Iran. 4. Happens anyhow which was clear already years ago.
3950 2018-10-14 22:50:43 Bergman will be irrelevant in time like the rest of the anti oil gang , most of which feed off government stupidity and our tax $
3951 2018-10-14 22:50:41 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
3952 2018-10-14 22:50:41 Lemme know if it works for you . I was told tea tree oil and vitamin E works as well
3953 2018-10-14 22:50:39 It’s one of the three classic aromatics used in cooking. Carrots and onions are the other two. Put them all together into what’s called a mirepoix, sauté them in olive oil and you have the base flavor of French cuisine.
3954 2018-10-14 22:50:33 The carbon tax is just on the production of greenhouse gases from any process. The problem in AB is that the oil sands take so much energy to process. Those that burn AB oil are also charged in 
3955 2018-10-14 22:50:32 If not for the prodigious amounts of oil in your country, your king and crown prince would be nothing more than goatherds sitting in filthy rags.
3956 2018-10-14 22:50:32 He knows gas prices are rising and wants to have an excuse to drill for more oil. This world deteriorate in less than 50 years.
3957 2018-10-14 22:50:23 There is no Gold backed RMB ..via oil or any other exchange methodology #confessyourunpopularopinion
3958 2018-10-14 22:50:06 One that's three stories high and slathered in oil on Mexico's side I hope.

Spotter nests every 500 yards would also be cool.
3959 2018-10-14 22:50:04 from what I read, palm oil is absolutely horrible. I don't actually think it can be part of a #vegan lifestyle.
But I believe that most soy is fed to cows.  Lot of the impact of farmed animals is growing the animal feed. It's causing huge #Deforestation in Brazil
3960 2018-10-14 22:50:00 I've had ants on the third floor of my old apartment. Peppermint oil can be used to deter them from coming in. And if you're good with plants, you can plant peppermint plants in pots to help.
3961 2018-10-14 22:49:58 I guess that's love because I don't need no oil in my water
3962 2018-10-14 22:49:44 Are the team caring for you Adrienne? Is the hospital making up for previous mistakes? 

RE; treatment; an extra anxiety & drain with the chemo? Living in Holland - I notice that you didnt list CBD oil? X
3963 2018-10-14 22:49:44 Yes, it should have lost it years ago. Think tank?  More like Stink Tank. The stink of  American oil billionaires that think everything should be privatized...even public schools.
3964 2018-10-14 22:49:39 Well, now we see why they wanted Iranian oil off the market via the help of the withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstatement of sanctions.
3965 2018-10-14 22:49:17 to be fair, and now that I read the backgrounder, it is intended to eat into the big slice that is electricity generation. Main problems I see are that it's voluntary, and doesn't tackle the big questions about what to do with Oil (flaring) and coal, or how to build out wind
3966 2018-10-14 22:49:08 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
3967 2018-10-14 22:49:07 Saudis are talking all kinds of trash right now - fear in oil prices (up 2% right now).
3968 2018-10-14 22:48:58 Hey Turnip, do you know that Trump's NOT SO BLIND TRUST invested heavily in oil futures just before he declared sanctions on Iran? When SA reduces oil output in response to actions against them he'll make billions. Trump is in quite a dilemma!

おはようございます

おめでとうございます
3970 2018-10-14 22:48:42 It’s a crime against humanity to NOT address climate change that can be proven!  Why hasn’t TRUMP investigated, go to the poles & speak to the scientists?  Why?  Greed& commitment to the oil, gas & fossil fuel companies!  I am surprised why the UN doesn’t press charges against US
3971 2018-10-14 22:48:39 I been doing this “hot” oil treatment in my head for at least 24 hours  I’m THE laziest natural
3972 2018-10-14 22:48:35 Don't make me barf. You are stuck on trying to make TMX saleable when the reality is more oil produced is more oil burned is more GHG which accelerates #climatechange. What is it - you have shares in TMX?

3974 2018-10-14 22:48:17 Essential oil plus defuser, He puts it in our water to drink, etc. it’s a whole choreography.
3975 2018-10-14 22:48:16 Oil prices. Which really don’t matter since we have oil here and if we move to renewables and electric vehicles it won’t even matter.
3976 2018-10-14 22:48:13 really man? the soviets did that? 
Since you seem to have a beef with history books, why don't you watch RAMBO III again?

PS I will add a variable to the equation: Oil Companies
3977 2018-10-14 22:47:46 No Secret, the Bush family & others from America's oil & military industrial complex. Billy Sol Estes reveals practically everyone involved. He's related to Ashley Estes...Brett Kavanaugh's wife. If you read his book you will essentially know who killed JFK, RFK, MLK, & Malcolm X
3978 2018-10-14 22:47:35 Heavy lifting was the Palm oil for my yam lol
3979 2018-10-14 22:47:32 Supports innovation in our oil sands.

This woman and Notley are too stupid to understand that the only innovation resulting will be economically negative technologies producing things nobody wants except adherents of their peculiar Gaia worshiping religion.
3980 2018-10-14 22:47:19 First her dog who has Cushings disease has completely changed, and now her and her Mom.
The power of CBD oil cannot go unnoticed. Two more lives changed, and they will only improve more

3982 2018-10-14 22:47:04 55% of Canada's imported oil to East coast refineries is from USA. Saudi imported are 10 - 12%
3983 2018-10-14 22:47:03 I make extra virgin olive oil look like a slut.
3984 2018-10-14 22:47:03 That's not possible...Obama and Biden didn't leave any values to be destroyed...That administration was like a dose of crotin oil to this country!
3985 2018-10-14 22:46:44 If I said something outta line yesterday don’t sweat it..it was the oil  #HC2018
3986 2018-10-14 22:46:39 It's all for Cannabiole (cannaboil oil?) I think I'm spelling it wrong 
3987 2018-10-14 22:46:39 Seems to me if all we cared about was oil and natural gas, we'd have thrown Israel under the bus decades ago.
3988 2018-10-14 22:46:36 I hope it's not filled with "Bunker C" crude oil, as getting going will take a lot longer than if it's full of NATO configuration F-76 fuel. #2 Diesel to everyone else. Untaxed diesel that is.

3991 2018-10-14 22:46:26 #Uganda Bad oil deal. 
 The disputes mean that the date of first oil production is once again pushed farther; this time from 2020 to 2025, according to insider estimates.

By that time Museveni will be 81 years old, with an election looming in 2026.

://wp.me/p7FLkS-miC
3992 2018-10-14 22:46:25 Yes you are young and rich.when was the last time you made sure your mom had cooking oil!.
3993 2018-10-14 22:46:23 Can you recommend any articles on this topic? My expectation is we would see significant inflation and weakness in the dollar if the Saudi’s decide to price their oil in currencies other than the dollar.
3994 2018-10-14 22:46:21 Pipelines are the safest method of transporting crude oil, with fewer & smaller spills than truck, train or ship. The problem with the pipeline is what happens after the oil is loaded on tankers. The channel to the open ocean is difficult to navigate & ecologically fragile.
3995 2018-10-14 22:46:19 It's because Valero knows that oil comes marine life, not dinosaurs!
3996 2018-10-14 22:46:12 Ngga justru itu bisa ngurangin minyak nya
Kan pake oil clenser pun d usap pake kapas dulu
Baru d usap pake kapas yg ada airnya
Bukand bilas ya

Kan abis itu d pakein milk cleanser. 
Kalo abis oil trs langsung milk cleanser
Malah jd g bersih
Karena sisa minyak masih ada d kulit
3997 2018-10-14 22:46:03 Amen sister! With all the money Saudi gets by selling oil...they never invest in innovation or their people to have freedom of expression or thought. Saudi needs to go!
3998 2018-10-14 22:45:52 (but they have all the oil so that's okay)

4005 2018-10-14 22:45:06 I wish everyone could just feel my legs an everything rn. Shaved w coconut oil today an I’m lovin’ it 
4006 2018-10-14 22:45:04 Coconut oil clogs the hell out of my pores, all pilsusually do so I tend to avoid them
4007 2018-10-14 22:44:57 Cancer rates are 400% higher in communities close to oil/gas flares.
4008 2018-10-14 22:44:56 Whaaaaat! I agree with you on palm oil but if you think factory farms aren’t one of it not the biggest contributor to climate change your crazy. If we want to help, the easiest and best thing anyone can do is not eat meat!!!
4009 2018-10-14 22:44:46 Not in Thunder Bay. Does Ford know where that is?  The money is going straight to the Oil companies. Nice work!
4010 2018-10-14 22:44:40 It goes both ways....pretty sure most Western countries can take the oil price hike...can the Saudis? Venezuela 2.0

Go ahead, cut off your oil supply - it will help move the rest of the world more quickly away from fossil fuels & bury your pathetic tinpot kingdom in revolution & poverty.

4016 2018-10-14 22:43:36 @Teresa159Harris (G)
@Sara59703838, Ok, this a nieve question on my part, America don't depend on Saudi for oil as. Much, what reason, would they have on oil prices?. Why do America care.about oil prices?
4017 2018-10-14 22:43:22 Why is olive oil so good but olives are so bad?
4018 2018-10-14 22:43:13 Sleep deprivation affects your motor skills. With this said, my oil burner has shattered into pieces. 
4019 2018-10-14 22:43:07 We control the global market of oil , we can destroy your country in one week.
4020 2018-10-14 22:43:04 Pls am not understanding oil
What's periwinkle here??
4021 2018-10-14 22:42:57 Dumb "anarcho capitalist" cult leader that's really a white nationalist snake oil salesmen.
4022 2018-10-14 22:42:46 It’s not on the sea bed, because crude oil floats. Only about 10% of the spill was covered. The rest is mixed into sand along the shore, in cracks among rocks. The environmental damage continues.
4023 2018-10-14 22:42:46 It’s not only the oil price, Muslims around the world consider Saudi Arabia their sacred place & any attack on it(including the king & princes)is attack on Islam, thousands are welling to blow themselves up among infidels
4024 2018-10-14 22:42:30 it's the 3 cups of flavoring liquids: sesame oil (to fry ginger thins), soy sauce paste, and rice wine 

on cubed chicken thigh and basil ahhhh it's a good warm food for combatting cooling weather
4025 2018-10-14 22:42:29 
4026 2018-10-14 22:42:25 Yes, Russia wants oil through Syria/Iran. US wants oil, too. I am interventionist and feel we should stop arming terrorists. Who is to say how much that could have escalated? You don't need to be as close as Cuba to get to our homeland anymore either
4027 2018-10-14 22:42:23 Then we'll just bomb them into the stone ages and take their oil

4030 2018-10-14 22:42:03 Kinda normal ME politics & machinations, heightened by geopolitics and on HGH with oil/gas at play - Levant.

Turkey, Iran, Qatar, Syria, Russia, China, KSA, GCC, Israel, US, plus various terrorist groups/entities, whatever Libya is nowadays, Cyprus & various Europeans nations.
4031 2018-10-14 22:42:03 Next time ask him how much he has accepted in donations from oil corporations over the years and whether that influenced his stance on climate change.
4032 2018-10-14 22:41:43 I use tea tree shampoo one a week and just conditioner with a few drops of tea tree oil in it a few times a week. Depends how the curls are behaving lol
4033 2018-10-14 22:41:42 I did not claim that Scotland provides the majority of England’s power

After Independence rUK loses all the oil & gas in Scottish waters, the northern inter-connectors & all Scottish Generation it gets for free now

Dependent upon other countries for critical infra supply
4034 2018-10-14 22:41:40 The real issue with capitalism is that people who deserve cowboy boats, e.g. @mcmansionhell, do not have them. And people who don't deserve them, e.g. Texas Oil Billionaires, do.

4036 2018-10-14 22:41:35 A customer just walked up to me and said "I found the olives, now wheres the olive oil?"
I respond "In aisle 14"
"Now where'd the logic in that?!"
"Its with the baking supplies"
"You think it'd be with the olives"
4037 2018-10-14 22:41:32 Buy some coconut oil (or other oils in your house), I know I dont want to be that person either, but it really does break down stuff with much less effort than my other removers.
4038 2018-10-14 22:41:31 Threats and counter threats oil will be pushed up and then sell the hell out of it.. be careful it might go as good as 100-120 and new highs in oil
4039 2018-10-14 22:41:30 -wash ur hair every 2-3 days 

-don’t straighten/curl your hair often it slowly drys out your hair 

-if you do use a heat protectant 

-oil your hair 2-5 times a month to promote hair growth and strong,shiny hair 

-don’t use tight hairstyles often
4040 2018-10-14 22:41:26 Oil and gas are the past. The US can lead In technology and innovation and clean energy and carbon mitigation, and save the planet and create millions of jobs. That is the future.
4041 2018-10-14 22:41:25 The greatest oil reserves still lie within the Middle East.
4042 2018-10-14 22:41:18 Not all oil is equal or of the same type, and not all oil gets refined into the same product. Not every refinery makes the same type of petroleum products, and demand and supply aren't based upon what happens in aggregate. So oil is needed in different amounts at different times.
4043 2018-10-14 22:41:13 On the way to my 1st & last client of the day as I “Prepoo” my hair. I’m letting conditioner & organic coconut oil sit in it for a couple days then I’ll shampoo, deep condition, blow dry & flat iron. I loved how it came out last month.
4044 2018-10-14 22:41:07 Right. Eritreans who take oil as a contraband from #Ethiopia are hurting Ethiopian economy. No country on earth subsidies electronics, but oil do. 

ETH gov't publicly asked consumers to minimize oil consumption since oil importation consume huge Forex. No one should take it out.
4045 2018-10-14 22:41:02 Dems floated Cap & Trade to do just this in 2009 but the GOP (rolling in tens of M's from big oil & coal) said go to hell.  It's a great scam for fossil fuel industries, buying these pols off for M's in return for getting the public to front B's to deal with the problems.
4046 2018-10-14 22:41:00 We see whats happening in Europe. We do not want this chaos to happen in America. Now Germany will get their oil from Iran? Who is going to bail out Germany when they fall?
4047 2018-10-14 22:40:59 Its not just big oil/fossil fuel. Its everything. Capitalism treats our earth like a limitless resource giving garbage dump required to endlessly make $$$ to fulfill unchecked greed.

Its going to take a lot more than regs to save our planet.

4050 2018-10-14 22:40:50 Caps oil sands emissions. This is a repeat of her stupid point about harmless emissions being bad, because they might warm a cold climate.

This woman and Notley are too stupid to know not to repeat themselves.

It’s time to put an end to their Jihad.  MECA should have no relevance in western society.

EV & new tech will replace petro fueled vehicles in 10 Yrs.

’til then, TX, AK, ND & offshore can produce enough oil to flood the market. 
4057 2018-10-14 22:39:55 OBJ/Yaradua took over with enough foreign exchange, economy wasn't collapsing. PDP handed over already collapsed economy, by looting CBN dollars for election, fall in crude oil prices, petroleum subsidy. You can't boost economy in a year without proper planning, it will collapse.

4059 2018-10-14 22:39:38 Really going overboard with their $22 million from Big Oil polluters like BP and Chevron.
4060 2018-10-14 22:39:37 Saudi Arabia insinuating they can get away with murder & retaliate against sanctions because they’re feeding the world oil is just one more reason why we need to get cars electric ASAP.

4068 2018-10-14 22:39:00 Okay, so they've started to sell CBD oil 'round these parts. I've heard it'll help me reign in my anxiety, but I can't afford it. As crass as it may be, y'all wanna help me see if this shit really does help? I'm currently smoking pot when I can, and I'd rather not. :P
4069 2018-10-14 22:38:52 Our influence against you is not oil, but selling it in dollars, and I hope to break the sale of Saudi oil to the dollar and sell it in Chinese yuan or European currency.
4070 2018-10-14 22:38:34 didn’t you taste the oil in it?
4071 2018-10-14 22:38:33 can't be always might is right just because of oil

4076 2018-10-14 22:37:54 They don't hold up at all ... much like the peak oil prediction (by 1978 we would run out of oil) global warming prediction are completely out of wack ...
4077 2018-10-14 22:37:51 Additionally, while price point for oil demand destruction is much lower than $200, the cost of switching is also very high, thus moving away from oil takes time and investment. Can we stay solvent paying $200/barrel while we move to EV adoption?
4078 2018-10-14 22:37:51 Just sprayed my entire house with peppermint oil. And now I want to die because I’m so nauseous. Send help
4079 2018-10-14 22:37:48 Fresh garlic, scallions, light olive oil, and steam. DONE!
4080 2018-10-14 22:37:46 I think i just struck oil
4081 2018-10-14 22:37:39 #teslemmings don’t care if a journalist disappears in the Saudi consulate as long as they were thinking Saudi oil money could save their fraudulent leader.  

#TruthHurts
4082 2018-10-14 22:37:34 Oil prices didn't crash the subprime market in '08...it was the greed of the bankers and complicit bond rating agencies...reselling financial fantasies loaded with worthless mortgages doomed to default.
4083 2018-10-14 22:37:24 Pure and natural essential oil blends to center your mind, support your body, elevate your mood, and clean your home. High-quality, great price... Mother E 4076719
4084 2018-10-14 22:37:24 Narrative. Lol, and again some ideological bullshit. If the saudis threatens retaliation, republicans and democrats pay. Like 9/11. Like in the countless islamist sunni wahabi terror attacks, like al quaida or like the oil price shock in the 70s..
4085 2018-10-14 22:37:17 This Administration wants wildlife out of their way for more cattle grazing, oil drilling & fracking on Our public lands.
4086 2018-10-14 22:37:11 Nah, I recommend just keeping your scalp as clean as possible and use taliah waajid oil lightly  massage your scalp and ya hair finnagrowwwcuhz
4087 2018-10-14 22:37:08 I recall the "liar" in Oval Office swore SA (Saudi Arabia) would give U.S. "oil for free" for 10 years -same lie & hypocrisy that Mexico would pay for the Wall! Now SA owns Port ARthur-crown jewel" in U.S.refinery system- exposing U.S. Energy Infrastructure  to security threats.
4088 2018-10-14 22:36:49 Just nuke the Saudis, and take their precious radioactive oil
4089 2018-10-14 22:36:46 Thank you for saying that!  He's such a snake oil salesmen!  It's so upsetting to see people lie for him or willingly follow him.  It's disgusting.

4092 2018-10-14 22:36:43 A comparison will open ur eyes. Oil rich Venezuela was in same situation as us 2015, same mismanagement pre-2015, no Avengers 4 them. D recession was unstoppable 4 both. D challenge 4 leadership was 2 cushion effect. Venezuela+IMF economists = 400,000% inflation. PMB did well.
4093 2018-10-14 22:36:42 i can throw engine oil on my shit and its gon look tha same. aint no savin these mfs
4094 2018-10-14 22:36:38 Make sure u take loads of sun cream & NO oil!!!! Don’t be me x
4095 2018-10-14 22:36:37 We really need to make a push for independance of foreign oil in trade for renewable. Threats like this would then be laughable instead of viable.
4096 2018-10-14 22:36:37 Dunno what to ask but I'll say I hope you feel better because I'm bored and sad too and I don't want anyone else feeling this way. Also its bloody fucking cold where I live and I can't get furnace oil untill next thursday.
4097 2018-10-14 22:36:35 CBD oil is your best bet, not THC but that will make it more fun!
4098 2018-10-14 22:36:35 Instead of offering proof of life #JamalKhashoggi
Saudi Arabia instead threatens us w/ raising the price of oil, allowing the construction of a Russian military base & turning to Iran <-that deserves an lol.
I thought we didn't make deals w/ terrorists & kidnappers...
4099 2018-10-14 22:36:33 So what? Are we really to be beholden to some backwards kingdom that believes it can kill someone on video and get away with it? THIS is why we should have been telling oil interests to piss off a long time ago. We cannot depend on oil.
4100 2018-10-14 22:36:28 Thieves essential oil!!
4101 2018-10-14 22:36:27 Is it just me, or would Saudi “retaliation” for sanctions against them—in other words, jacking up oil prices—be just about the best possible thing for our planet?
4102 2018-10-14 22:36:19 You are on track.  The only way this message will get across is identifying what is lost in practical  due to the the oil price loss.    What we lose.  What we miss. This brings it down to ground level of understanding #cdnpoli    All else is theory and math
4103 2018-10-14 22:36:18 Seriously, grocer-boy, I don’t need you to individually bag each of my items. I’m sure my corn flakes and olive oil will peacefully coexist in the same sack

4105 2018-10-14 22:36:06 Oil burner on, the rain in the background and my pink salt lamp on low is providing such a sweet sleep aesthetic

4107 2018-10-14 22:36:01 TRUMP says climate is FABULOUS! Oh my gosh, it’s greed & profit for the oil & fossil fuel industries, via Koch Brothers, who are heavily invested at the expense of OUR  WORLD’s demise!  Just plant some trees!
4108 2018-10-14 22:35:58 So, it's also worth noting that many of the actions Saudis intend to take against the US have to do with their control over oil prices.

This kind of underscores why moving toward green energy actually decreases our exposure to foreign blackmail and threats.
4109 2018-10-14 22:35:49 I find that coconut oil is my solution to a lot of things  but I take that and mix in a little peppermint oil. Lots of benefits and smells great if you like mint.
4110 2018-10-14 22:35:35 I’m one episode in to Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. I’m sure I have a crush on @CiaoSamin. Engaged listening, a bright smile that reaches your eyes, and a deep passion for the things you love are so beautiful. What a beautiful show by a beautiful person. I want to drink olive oil.
4111 2018-10-14 22:35:03 Because it is not about service to country and ideas to expand the commonwealth for all Nigerians. It is more about access to political power as the means to share oil money.
4112 2018-10-14 22:35:01 If not for the fact that your country has prodigious amounts of oil, your king and crown prince would just be goatherds sitting in filthy rags.

4118 2018-10-14 22:34:32 Okay. Serious question here.  Why do we sell oil at half price because we don’t  deliver via pipeline?
4119 2018-10-14 22:34:29 Simple answer is a defined lack of integrity. I can't get anyone to investigate a multinational oil company for ruining my life and my family life.. People /Media are scared of stepping on political toes who have vested interests
4120 2018-10-14 22:34:17 @TurkiAldakhil please raise your oil price to 100 or 200 a barrel so we can finally bury you. The US is energy independent, play stupid games get stupid prizes. Can't wait for you to do that so we can regain complete ownership. You have nothing we don't have more of bud.
4121 2018-10-14 22:34:05 Then again Eisenhower CIA and British Petroleum installed the Shah when their elected President wanted to take oil out if foreign hands i.e. BP and Iran anger came to a head in the 70s. Seems our interference in Middle East has been a bust.
4122 2018-10-14 22:33:29 There’s a hyperlink in there saying that no danger has been made. Also, there’s oil wells under other schools in other neighborhoods.
4123 2018-10-14 22:33:23 Burning midnight oil at my best 
4124 2018-10-14 22:33:10 The Saudis have been taking the piss for decades because they have oil. We have become weak for it.

4127 2018-10-14 22:33:02 i just unsubbed from him. thomas said in the video after he broke up with his ex boyfriend that they were 2 toxic people and they really stuck with me.
until now, it is clear, he is unapologetically toxic. he wanted to use you to add oil to the fire and start more drama. toxic af
4128 2018-10-14 22:32:48 You do realize oil from Russia is shipping into your coast line as a result?  Also have you ever seen the amount of oil tankers from Seattle or Alaska?   Who do you think is putting out this bad Canadian oil narrative?
4129 2018-10-14 22:32:43 We only sell Russian ruble oil or Chinese yuan, and you will see the dollar is nothing
4130 2018-10-14 22:32:31 Well that's our only choice. We sure can't defend ourselves & since we don't refine oil, we'd run out in 2 weeks leaving all our lovely expensive war toys stationary. You have to ask what's the point of building subs & frigates when they'd remain tied to the dock with dry tanks.
4131 2018-10-14 22:32:30 If there's an oil drum on a floor are broken, the floor above will come crashing down.
4132 2018-10-14 22:32:26 Oil money
4133 2018-10-14 22:32:26 Perhaps US most violent and backward ally, SA is headed for financial collapse - its only weapon - the oil sword - is actually its own petard with which it threatens to hang itself
4134 2018-10-14 22:32:17 Any updates? I've been checking 3-4 times a day. I noticed your starting to run out of THC oil. I hope stock isn't being diverted to stores for this coming week. Those of us that use this medicine need a reliable source. And Vaping is not an option.
4135 2018-10-14 22:32:15 For oil prices if i am saudi i will reduce the production process so maybe we can see the barrel flys to over 120 .then MR mcfaul will have 2 options ( but a 100k tesla ) or use a toyota prius 
His tahoe V8 will rust in carage 
4136 2018-10-14 22:32:11 Oil slapping up like a buck 15 already though.
4137 2018-10-14 22:32:10 BEST WHEN PAIRED WITH THE THICK MUSK OF THAT BORKNAGAR BEARD OIL.
4138 2018-10-14 22:32:04 Barbarians.  As we all know, things in life change when there’s a ‘tipping point’.  I, for one, have no problem sanctioning a regime that won’t recognize women, kills and dismembers a journalist, etc.  USA can drill, frack, and supple all the oil we need in this country.
4139 2018-10-14 22:31:55 Wait until the oil runs out.
4140 2018-10-14 22:31:43 When you have Trump saying "I'd do a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding" "We should kill the children of terrorists" "we should take the oil" & so on, & millions vote for & support him, it isn't really hidding anything anymore.
4141 2018-10-14 22:31:39 I don’t use foundation Vitamin E oil does me wonders 
4142 2018-10-14 22:31:38 Do you know how easily it is to drill a shale oil well? USA would make this up in 45 days of new production.
4143 2018-10-14 22:31:29 5) The deal is for reduced emissions with unlimited oilsands production and they support climate change. Isn't this an oxymoronic deal? I mean how can they reduce emissions with unlimited oil sands development?
6) Everyone has hard feelings. Ms. Berman is attacked. @Tzeporah
4144 2018-10-14 22:31:21 Or uf we only had a way to get our own Canadian oil across our country......more than enough to supply our needs.
4145 2018-10-14 22:31:20 Saudi Arabia sells oil in dollars, only if we sell oil in another currency such as the Chinese yuan, the Saudi riyal or the European currency, the dollar will become less valuable than the toilet paper.
4146 2018-10-14 22:31:19 Gee, too bad there isn't a pipeline to eastern Canada so they could replace Saudi oil with ethical Western Canadian oil....oh yeah, there was one scheduled to be built but Trudeau killed Energy East.
4147 2018-10-14 22:30:51 Then big oil bought the GOP.
4148 2018-10-14 22:30:37 They could still jack the price of oil through the roof even though the US is a net exporter.
4149 2018-10-14 22:30:35 What kind of dream are you subjecting me to? 

Ok. This one time I can go without truffle oil.

4155 2018-10-14 22:29:52 1) So let me get this straight. 5 oil companies ask for an environmental activist on board to make a deal to reduce emissions. 
2) They don't consult other oil companies 
3) They don't have the cap but they support climate change.
4) Ms. Berman agrees. then disagrees with deal
4156 2018-10-14 22:29:51 Stupid sells ads.
4157 2018-10-14 22:29:45 I used a makeup wipe to clean my eyebrow brush with Nivea double eye makeup remover (the lil one)  before dipping it into the pomade, the oil makes the dry texture a little easier to work with x
4158 2018-10-14 22:29:32 Is it just me or is all this out of control government spending not rebuilding our infrastructure?And how much of our military spending goes towards propping up oil regimes( Saudis)we have the cheapest fuel taxes and pay for hurricane damage with income,not carbon taxes.
4159 2018-10-14 22:29:28 It's not a direct link but it's 'hinky'

4162 2018-10-14 22:29:05 We could open dialogue with Iran a country that produces more oil than the Saudi’s. It might be a bright new begging.

4172 2018-10-14 22:28:41 He will call Saudi prince as promised 4 effect.  Then publicly say he believes SA had nothing to do with disappearance/death.  End of story.  He does not want to give up military contract & USA needs oil.  Remember, USA took no action after 9/11!
4173 2018-10-14 22:28:40 Better oil those chairs Stan
4174 2018-10-14 22:28:34 I think we can supply our own oil. Fu&k them.
4175 2018-10-14 22:28:31 I don't think you know how oil markets work.  Sure, SA can shut off the taps completely, but then they shut off the $$ too, and they can't afford to do that.

4180 2018-10-14 22:28:07 Why America starting shit with Saudi Arabia like they won't just stop sending oil for a week , and watch chaos unfold here
4181 2018-10-14 22:27:56 Saudi Arabia sells oil in dollars, only if we sell oil in another currency such as the Chinese yuan, the Saudi riyal or the European currency, the dollar will become less valuable than the toilet paper.
4182 2018-10-14 22:27:53 We don't need oil. The US could be the world leader in green energy, billions of dollars to be made and thousands of new good paying jobs. It would also end the worthless wars fought over oil. But of course the GOP is owned & would never do what's best for America..
4183 2018-10-14 22:27:36 A few costly lawsuits will get his attention
4184 2018-10-14 22:27:21 Is this a trap for black people?
4185 2018-10-14 22:27:14 Bull.  Postmedia is an American-owned special-interest group supporting the oil industry and other RW causes.
4186 2018-10-14 22:27:07 Exactly - but not just the Trump admin- thanks to fracking technology - the US has now the world’s largest oil reserves by an orrder of magnitute.
4187 2018-10-14 22:26:51 Yeah turning off the lights and eating less meat is great but imagine if we stopped catering to massive oil corporations and started harnessing all the renewable energy that’s right in front of us???
4188 2018-10-14 22:26:35 4.)You chant-"Lock her up" for Uranium to Russia,after facts show deal by State Dept's Undersecretary-Not Clinton! You cheer Trump when he says he won't "stand for foreign ownership of oil refineries -yet no outrage after he consented to sale of U.S.  largst Oil refinery to SA.
4189 2018-10-14 22:26:26 We don't need the Saudis. We have our own Oil fields. Mexico has Oil. Make friends with Venezuela. Help them out economically. That would give us a decade to go Solar & Wind completely. But will they do that? No. We need to get out of that part of the World. They suck.
4190 2018-10-14 22:26:19 Hahahahahahahaha.  OK I'd love to see them try to pull this shit.  Go ahead and install that Russian base, take oil to $200, etc, etc.  But dont forget who they ran to during the Gulf War and every time things go sideways (like most of the rest of the world)
4191 2018-10-14 22:26:16 いちろ~が可哀想なさまいち、興奮する
4192 2018-10-14 22:26:13 Saudi Arabia has never done such a horrible act. Come on people be a bit smarter, if Saudi Arabia would do such a thing why haven’t they done it to Saad Alfaqih? Whom has been its biggest enemy and the head of the saudi reform movement It is just a game to lower the oil prices
4193 2018-10-14 22:26:11 #oil could be in for a major breakout this week.
4194 2018-10-14 22:26:11 I’ve been epicly wrong on this call from the beginning of Sept so take these with a grain of salt but $vii, $nva, $kel positioned to benefit from higher liquids pricing with any crude move as well as LNG progress. Straight oil names $wcp and $ath are strong picks.
4195 2018-10-14 22:26:06 They would have to stop pumping oil to accomplish anything, n’est-ce pas? Can they afford that?
4196 2018-10-14 22:26:00 When my daughter was younger, we were in a Pier 1 and she grabbed some of those oil incense diffuser sticks and started "applying" them to herself like perfume... She ended up hanging an unexpected allergic reaction on our way home - complete with hives and breathing issues.

4199 2018-10-14 22:25:42 C-P-C says it will maintain its cap on gasoline and diesel prices until the end of the year to help keep domestic price levels stable, despite rising international oil prices.
4200 2018-10-14 22:25:29 Copying and pasting definitions from online would not help you understand what it is. Let me explain a bit, when Nigeria sells whatever it sells(mostly crude oil) we get paid in dollars. That money belongs to our government, but it can't spend $ in the local economy.
4201 2018-10-14 22:25:23 We did not have a problem with the electorate when Obama and Clinton were in office? Let's not talk about tyranny. We get our oil and clothes from countries run by tyrants but that does not matter as long as we are warm! Lol..

Whom has been its biggest enemy and the head of the saudi reform movement It is just a game to lower the oil prices
4204 2018-10-14 22:25:13 With a hypothetical oil price of $200 (or higher), fracking becomes exponentially more profitable.

4206 2018-10-14 22:25:08 Reminds me of the fictional tale of Moby Dick and it’s being made into a movie, directed by Ron Howard. In the movie, after Mont Dick had destroyed lives, barrels of oil and the ship, all the ship owners could think of was their own interesting wanted suppression of fact.Ya..
4207 2018-10-14 22:25:05 Messy - mud, oil, jello etc...
4208 2018-10-14 22:25:02 Trump could drill for oil with his #draftdodging bone spurs
4209 2018-10-14 22:25:00 RETWEET if you are “pumped” about America exporting RECORD amounts of oil and natural gas!
4210 2018-10-14 22:24:50 It is where naughty things happen.  

The oil reserves are irrelevant
4211 2018-10-14 22:24:45 ....and I thought Cheney did that for his gas and oil dynasty—-Halliburton. 
4212 2018-10-14 22:24:44 The largest proportion of U.S. oil imports comes from Canada.
You know..... our closest ally whom Trump insults at every turn because he has a personal jealousy of Trudeau.
(Great basis for foreign/economic policy, right?)
4213 2018-10-14 22:24:42 It’s a despotic kip. Dangerous in the extreme for anyone with an opinion. Dangerous for women. Dangerous for gay people. 

And not content with the absolute wreck you made of your own country, you actively export your misery abroad. 

Soon you’ll run out of oil. Then we’ll see.
4214 2018-10-14 22:24:41 oil couldn't even rally up by 2%. sigh
4215 2018-10-14 22:24:36 I was gobsmacked to learn that cow emissions outstrip oil impact. The right will argue that this means it’s NOT a human-mediated problem, but it 100% is. Our reliance on beef and dairy wholly creates it. We need to lose this reliance; even subbing a meal a week makes a difference
4216 2018-10-14 22:24:25 what is the difference between an oil company and a video game company
4217 2018-10-14 22:24:24 You also should know that we can sell our oil with our Saudi Currency, or we can buy firearms from Russia and  china. Imagine oil price trippled.
4218 2018-10-14 22:24:22 Only the Saudis had some sort of small control over oil prices. And now they are in a bad mood over this journalist story. I actually do not think they will take any action as the West will stay quiet. But the market needs to price in a certain chance of them taking action.
4219 2018-10-14 22:24:22 So what? That doesn't mean you can, at present moment, scale a major world economy without oil or natural gas and rely only on renewables. It just means humans are wasteful. We waste a ton of food too
4220 2018-10-14 22:24:19 Not oil as energy use, it is also used to make many of our everyday things.

4224 2018-10-14 22:24:02 @algore is a snake oil salesman
4225 2018-10-14 22:23:58 No they don't! We don't need their oil and a few months of not selling them arms to continue their atrocities in Yemen aren't going to hurt our standing as peacemakers at all.

4227 2018-10-14 22:23:45 Phyllo dough is always a pain in the ass for me to work with. At least decided to just pile the shit up & coat w/ oil as each sheet didn't separate easily (also this method is useless & annoying af). Also didn't let the shit really thaw out. So my spanakopita bits of flakyiness.

4230 2018-10-14 22:23:37 Okay maybe I’ll try that. For some reason with the flax egg the oil separated and it started to boil
4231 2018-10-14 22:23:33 How do you know the government hasn't already made one and is hiding it in an oil cleanup center

4235 2018-10-14 22:23:20 I think it might be potato sticks on a smear of oil...
4236 2018-10-14 22:23:15 Taste…Oil is probably my favorite. What’s your #1?
4237 2018-10-14 22:23:11 Our largest supplier of oil is Canada.
4238 2018-10-14 22:22:59 Saudi Arabia has never done such a horrible act. Come on people be a bit smarter, if Saudi Arabia would do such a thing why haven’t they done it to Saad Alfaqih?

4239 2018-10-14 22:22:55 No.  Iran has had cruise missiles pointed at their oil field for two decades.  If they want to be part of this re-shaping of Sunni States, Israel and the US, they cannot do stuff like this.
4240 2018-10-14 22:22:36 At 35k a Tesla 3 is about the same price as a loaded Honda or Toyota, not being held hostage by idiots who’s oil fields the rest of the world built...priceless.

4242 2018-10-14 22:22:32 I don't believe no punishment will come from White House. Trump doesn't want to lose the billions for us weapons deal..cost of barrel of oil will go over 150.00 a barrel.
4243 2018-10-14 22:22:29 Alright, I just made the @ArtificialChris chili, but in a way that won’t cause my doctor to yell at me (turkey instead of beef, a minimal amt of olive oil, no beer, a little red wine vinegar instead of wine, some dark cocoa powder) and it was still awesome.
4244 2018-10-14 22:22:14 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.
4245 2018-10-14 22:22:14 Make no mistake, if Saudi Arabia begins to accept a country's (Buyer of oil) own currency there's no more PetroDollar which is based on USD. It will immediately crush the USD and send us into a tailspin.
Tariffs on the left of me..PetroDollar on the right..here I am.
4246 2018-10-14 22:22:12 I'm not sure they want to see how much oil America can really get at a bearable price.
4247 2018-10-14 22:22:08 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
4248 2018-10-14 22:21:54 9/11_____now Khahshoggi.  Oil & $ let you get away with anything. SAUDI ARABIA must be brought to justice.
4249 2018-10-14 22:21:39 Think most oil companies have geared at 65 oil, might at a stretch but many others struggle. And you end up taking deepwater off the market and shale will see lower growth.
4250 2018-10-14 22:21:35 i dont have an electric car, do you?  trucks on the highway that move stuff... trains.. planes... all need that "oil madness" to function... 

how do you propose "stopping"?
4251 2018-10-14 22:21:24 How will you create jobs but hav nearly 50 years worth of oil revenue and hav nuthin 2 show for it???  Smh..
4252 2018-10-14 22:21:18 The West,and not just the US,has been playing footsie with Saudi Arabia for far too long.We shouldn't be buying their blood oil. To his credit, Trudeau was ahead of the curve in criticizing the Saudis not so long ago. But Canada,standing alone, just can't exert enough influence
4253 2018-10-14 22:21:16 Or you have Iranian or Russian oil? Or better yet, US shale can restart in earnest 
4254 2018-10-14 22:21:14 You want to "save the planet" as it were?

Well, no joke, but you have come to the right twitter account, seriously...

Want to get 80-95% of the oil out?
Want clean skies?
Want freedom in travel, door to door?
Want to live long and prosper?

Let's talk.
4255 2018-10-14 22:20:52 Iran was given back their $ from our sanctions on them, I believe. And Iran has a democracy, kind of, that we undermined in the 50’s for oil access. We installed an abusive dictator.
We support Saudi Arabia. They are awful. Oppressive, abusive, patriarchal dictatorship
4256 2018-10-14 22:20:48 Well we will blockade their oil then. They won’t be able to get it out of their country.
4257 2018-10-14 22:20:34 @Teresa159Harris (C) 
@Sara59703838, I don't agree  I think Americans are more depended heavily on Saudi oil. I think politicians tell that to Americans, but I don't think that is true. Ask the U.S. show you guys  proof?
4258 2018-10-14 22:20:33 sooooooo... we import a million barrells a day.. how do you imagine we can stop this "oil madness"?
4259 2018-10-14 22:20:27 "Our Saudi imports"?? We don't import oil. The oil companies and refineries are the ones making those decisions. Why are you not shaming Irving refineries for choosing Saudi oil rather than from other sources?

Woooow!!!!
4262 2018-10-14 22:20:04 It's the oil. We need to stop depending on imports, and countries trading oil in us dollars.
4263 2018-10-14 22:19:44 True, but the price of oil is (by and large) global. Scarcity from one source is scarcity everywhere, no matter who the direct buyer normally is.
4264 2018-10-14 22:19:21 We already have tight environmental controls. In the grand scheme of things the small margin we can further reduce will make no difference. There is no energy east pipeline, instead we just import dirty oil shipped from the Middle East burning the worlds dirtiest fuel.
4265 2018-10-14 22:19:06 I deriously think he should piss off. Tired of being held over a ‘barrel’.   What would happen to the saudi economy if everyone stipped buying its oil?  Lots of other countries have oil to sell.

4270 2018-10-14 22:18:49 I make mine with olive oil and rarely leave the house, sooo... XD

4273 2018-10-14 22:18:24 ALSO..  2  CAN PLAY  THIS  BLOODY  GAME..  have the  west  support IRAN.. ANOTHER  SUPPLIER OF  OIL.  let's s ee how  far  Saudis  get  with their  bloody  threats..plus..Iranians  are easier  to  talk  to  &  more  western than  these  underhanded    Saudis.
4274 2018-10-14 22:18:15 So "cheap gas" ( and "arms sales") is enough to set aside concerns about war crimes atrocities and murder?
Ah well.  It wouldn't be the the first country to have a regime toppled or propped up  in the search for better oil deals.

How do you think the whole Iran mess started?

4278 2018-10-14 22:17:33 Yes...Saudi Arabia is bogus...Silly me...They count for nothing in the oil markets....Yeah...Great thinking !!! Way to go !!!
4279 2018-10-14 22:17:31 Since when do opposition leaders represent Canada abroad. So even your premise is unethical.
Oh! but I get it: you're there not to represent Canada but the oil sands industry.

4281 2018-10-14 22:17:20 the oil price , you are not involved in the production cost. we increase and decrease the oil price based on the cost of production. We aren't going to produce it for no profit to satisfy your selfish need.

4288 2018-10-14 22:16:34 no one  buys  their oil..   NO  one  travels  to their kigdoms.  BOYCOTT  THE  GULF  STATES  FROM  TOURISM.. LET'S S EE HOW LONG  THEY LAST.  they're  dependent on both.  nothing more.
4289 2018-10-14 22:16:32 The closest thing I’d say are Wall Street and oil titans. You’d probably say I’m an evil-doer: my aim, to give you health care and a greater portion of the wealth you generate — I want to tax Zuck, Musk, Bloomberg, Bezos and give the money to people like you.

4309 2018-10-14 22:14:45 The Trump admin has made the US more energy-independent. Less than 5% of the oil we import is from the gulf states, most is from the US/Canada.
4310 2018-10-14 22:14:44 There’s no doubt that Saudi Arabia can do lots of things will effect the US economy, it could stop the army deal, and they are controlling the oil prices, which is, it will be effective

4314 2018-10-14 22:14:30 "There are marginalized people working there" seems like a bizarre fig leaf to use to defend supporting terrible companies. Like, there are marginalized people working at most oil companies and banks that no one seems to have issues about boycotting? Why is Riot different?

4326 2018-10-14 22:12:58 We could invest in the future by lacing the oceans with power cables and use only solar and wind energy. Oil has its uses, but not for everyday electric usage. Be smart, be creative, invest for tomorrow. Agree? Retweet!

"All of these people go around saying they wanna get freaky with oil spill boy, but if you ever actually seen him, you'd piss yourself and cry."
4332 2018-10-14 22:11:51 to whichever of my roommates spilled olive oil all over the cupboard and didnt clean it up.... perish
4333 2018-10-14 22:11:12 Not nice

4335 2018-10-14 22:11:01 Chickpea flour is used to make poppadoms. You can microwave them in ~ 40 seconds. No frying. No oil.
4336 2018-10-14 22:10:49 Dear Creepy Porn Lawyer.

I recently ordered 2 gallons of your snake oil and a pair of your ambulance chasing sneakers in size 9.
It has been weeks now, and nothing.
We still believe in you, after all your heroics.

4337 2018-10-14 22:10:44 I’m selling three large canvas paintings ... they’re all based on @nasa photos . One is oil on canvas, the other two are acrylic paintings. Pictures coming soon! Anyone looking for original #astroart on a large scale? Two nebulas and one  galaxy. 
4338 2018-10-14 22:10:17 The United States is on track to become the worlds largest producer of oil.

If history has taught us anything, it's that the United States will soon be invading the United States.

4340 2018-10-14 22:10:03 Brittish petroleum etc. research total recall on oil fields.
Clayton said pennszoil sucked. Hard on engines. Your call.
4341 2018-10-14 22:09:59 Lol, read that weeks ago.  I own stock in both companies.  I expect both to do extremely well, but I like CV products better than CW.  The balm is better, the drops taste awesome, and the gummies are delicious.  CW’s drops taste like olive oil
4342 2018-10-14 22:09:50 Last last petrol na just crude oil way waka enter refinery
4343 2018-10-14 22:09:44 What happens in a possible  scenario of $45/barrel oil price say in near term of 6 months that said self liquidating assets would not have started generating income?I am also quite irritated that you are not getting my point!63% current debt service ratio is concerning!
4344 2018-10-14 22:09:34 I thought U.S. was no longer dependent on Saudi oil or any ME oil?
4345 2018-10-14 22:09:20 Between Export Oil Price Differentials, and Import Oil Price Premiums. Canada fritters away 5 percent of the GDP, and could easily improve the balance of trade for all Canadian, improving the health of the economy.
4346 2018-10-14 22:09:17 Actually, reality says we'll just come and take your oil if we wanted to.
Dropping bombs on yo moms, rag.

4348 2018-10-14 22:09:10 How did he make it worse? He went and reduced oil price? He sponsored Avengers? Buhari is doing well. You keep repeating that Buhari has failed narrative hoping people will believe it. Buhari has not failed. It's ur eyes/ears that r closed wt propaganda. How has Buhari failed?
4349 2018-10-14 22:09:10 Fair enough. I just got curious. 
Since I have over the years, heard that you need to soak your GW minis in either brake fluid, olive oil, vinegar, etc.
4350 2018-10-14 22:09:10 That will definitely help with the swelling and it’s work a shot. I did cabbage compress with tea tree and lavender oil and coconut oil as a base.
4351 2018-10-14 22:08:53 I find it very fascinating that conservatives are promoting the idea that domestically produced oil should be consumed in Canada. I guess a lot has changed in 40 years, and maybe now is the time for a national policy on energy.
4352 2018-10-14 22:08:43 The only reason KSA has any money is becausewegive it to them. They crawled out of the desert in the 20th century because of oil.  Their cultural evolution is stuck in the stone age.  Quit giving them money and they will ultimately go away.
4353 2018-10-14 22:08:37 ACR, get me the coconut oil!
4354 2018-10-14 22:08:30 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
4355 2018-10-14 22:08:30 Saudis reject US threats over missing journalist Raekwon the Chef, warn oil could skyrocket
4356 2018-10-14 22:08:20 Saudi report threatens Trump over #JamalKhashoggi

1. Install a Russian base
2. Take oil to $200
3. Kill the petro dollar
4. Stop buying US weapons

US will "stab its own economy to death"
4357 2018-10-14 22:08:18 Passed a stall in the market this morning selling cannabis oil..which you can't smoke, doesn't get you high and only helps if you've had a stroke (which I haven't, at least not in the last 48 hours) or suffer a debilitating illness.

I don't understand what all the fuss is about.
4358 2018-10-14 22:08:13 I don’t think she’d had cat food until we got her. She was very malnourished. She’s still eating critical nutrition daily to supplement her canned and kibble. I sauté chicken breasts couple of times a week. Just olive oil, salt&pepper. Give her tiny pieces by hand. Her treat.
4359 2018-10-14 22:08:08 Does that mean we can buy all the best players and win everything? Cos if so, sign me the fuck up hahaha. Oil money here we come 
4360 2018-10-14 22:08:05 I get what you are saying but at the same time, when you say snake oil, there has to be definitive characteristics of $tpay that you believe to be fake. Do you agree that $tpay provides optional private transactions? Whether or not the code base is bleeding edge?
4361 2018-10-14 22:08:03 Every piece of infrastructure on the planet has those same elements, including oil rigs, pipelines, tanker trucks, trains and ships, refineries and gas stations. So that's a moot point.

Generating and transporting renewable energy is a helluva lot safer than oil though.
4362 2018-10-14 22:08:01 Yoooooooo #essentialoils is the truth!! Been battling a headache since Thursday but the oil diffuser got me all the way together....now if I can get rid of the rest of these ailments 
4363 2018-10-14 22:07:57 The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst out at you from their hiding place 
Like acid and oil on a madman's face his reasons tend to fly away 
Like lesser birds on four winds like silver scrapes in may 
Now the sands become a crust and most of you have gone away
4364 2018-10-14 22:07:54 Are we some huge market that would really put a dent in sales or what.  And how soon do the same keyboards warriors start complaining when the price of gas or home heating oil goes up?
4365 2018-10-14 22:07:45 Bullshit, Romney & Traitor McCain touted their disapproval of Pres. Trump. he is lying 2 the American Ppl, we know he’s a snake N the grass turn coat. He’s talking just 2 get elected then will chg. We ain’t buying their snake oil no more, “fool me twice...can’t get fooled again.”
4366 2018-10-14 22:07:39 I just today noticed prices on produce & olive oil up a lot. Gas increased 30% in my area about 8 months into orange golem's take-over. I've been waiting for cars, wine & beer, appliances & building supplies to go up too.
4367 2018-10-14 22:07:38 The 70s called. They'd like their threats back. We don't need their stinking oil. #Renewables #Canada
4368 2018-10-14 22:07:35 Your Neighbours to the North are selling you oil from moral production at a massive discount.  While we call out Saudi human rights abuses.  Don’t forget who your real friends are.  
4369 2018-10-14 22:07:33 Yam and butter = yam and oil,  u should try yam and tea
4370 2018-10-14 22:07:29 Shouldn’t take an hour to change the  oil on a car smh

4372 2018-10-14 22:07:18 Second time in as many range trips it’s happened. After first time I broke down my BCG and cleaned the shit out of it. But I also oiled down my rifle something crazy. Range officer says too much oil is just as bad as not enough.

4374 2018-10-14 22:06:54 #IStandWithSaudiArabia
If the US threatens to impose sanctions on Saudi, we will stop the sale of oil in the market, we can go back to the Arab's desert to live there , and we will see what the United States will do with its industry and economy! No one can blackmail Saudi .
4375 2018-10-14 22:06:50 My mom just told us that she used to mark crosses with olive oil over our bedroom doors because she thought we were possessed

4379 2018-10-14 22:06:31 The entire middle east is one giant ignorant sharia law terror zone.
We'll take your oil too, we don't need you.
4380 2018-10-14 22:06:27 Cool. How many years did it take OBJ to pay back? How much did he leave in foreign account? How much was crude oil price for 16years? How much was left in foreign account? How do you account for Osita's spreadsheet?
4381 2018-10-14 22:06:14 Remember when we were raging about Saudi Arabia shows. But are fine with shows in America where the government bombs fuck out everyone over some oil.
4382 2018-10-14 22:05:56 Constructs of time do not exist when you are:

-waiting on an oil change
-kissing
-in a hospital

4384 2018-10-14 22:05:41 On the full size, you have SWIFT, Sneider, Knight and a laundry list of companies running clase 8s. On the light side you have thousands of 1 to 5 truck companies. When the oil fields folded, most jumped to generalized freight. How many medium duty companies have you heard of?
4385 2018-10-14 22:05:41 It simply means that we’ll have a much better excuse to refine our own oil. SA can drown in their oil for all I care.
4386 2018-10-14 22:05:36 I am calling for Complete Isolation of Saudi Arabia=
Let stop bying their Oil_Make Saudis Poor diddles!
World can buy nice Russian OIL.

4388 2018-10-14 22:05:28 Welcome back to the 1973 oil embargo.
4389 2018-10-14 22:05:11 Yes. If u season it right tho...
Shrimp/chicken fried rice, sesame seed oil. I love it. Lol
4390 2018-10-14 22:05:11 You can use makeup wipes just make sure they are oil free! The oil makes them come off
4391 2018-10-14 22:05:06 Says the person who’s party is practically owned by the NRA and Oil + Gas Lobby
4392 2018-10-14 22:04:44 I’m gonna cry if it’s my transmission fucking up on my car  hopefully I just need to flush the oil or something 
4393 2018-10-14 22:04:40 Wrote over 2000 words today, got the truck's oil changed, prepped at the bakery, cleaned the house, cooked some food, & made sure 2 small children didn't perish or become psychologically scarred.

DAY OFF, MY ASS.
4394 2018-10-14 22:04:38 Medical mj is a completely different thing form CBD oil. They are different. 

Exactly like apples vs. oranges. 

Both fruits. Some similarities. Some overlap. Different plants.
4395 2018-10-14 22:04:36 It's instructive that the Liberals expect oil contracts to be assessed for 'downstream' impact due to use, but not jèt aircraft, autos or military equipment. Selective values? I acknowledge the SA deal was pre-Lib, but circumstances have changed and action is requiŕed.
4396 2018-10-14 22:04:20 pretty good bet Saudis are going to hold back some oil to show Trump/world what will happen if there are sanctions... could see new highs in oil pretty quickly
4397 2018-10-14 22:04:01 i smell sesame oil and ginger looks like 3 cup chicken is on the menu tonight
4398 2018-10-14 22:03:39 We don’t need Saudi oil - let them sell it to the Chinese- see how that goes. Our shale plays, and Canadian crude will support our domestic needs. We need SA for nothing. They should be beholding to the US (and not @realDonaldTrump)
4399 2018-10-14 22:03:37 We’re not that dependent on Saudi oil. We buy their oil to help prop up their economy. They know that too. This will come to a quick resolution.

4402 2018-10-14 22:03:23 No One will pay that. No One. All the other oil producing countries will continue to honor their contracts.#bluff #badone
4403 2018-10-14 22:03:21 Can't write in details how it went but FAM, when the foy d oil and it was about to gosh out, come and see me jerk like a car..LMAOOO!!
4404 2018-10-14 22:03:21 Not cure. Snake oil.
4405 2018-10-14 22:03:18 Amen:      Thou lovest righteousness, and hateth wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy fellows.
4406 2018-10-14 22:03:06 Saudis can’t eat or drink their oil
4407 2018-10-14 22:03:05 Just WOW!  Is it our shared interest in oil, arms and money?
4408 2018-10-14 22:03:02 I thought for sure you and @Spydercat4 were revving up another wave of enlightenment for me.
I was imagining a abandoned oil rig being used as a base camp for a international sex-slave human trafficking ring. You guys messed me up...lol. Im looking for hidden messages everywhere.
4409 2018-10-14 22:02:57 @seantafc Congrats on the 2018 Lucas Oil Alcohol Funny Car Championship @zMAXDragway
4410 2018-10-14 22:02:44 That’s weird because I’m drinking coconut oil from a wine glass right now!
4411 2018-10-14 22:02:38 One day oil will collapse..The question is from what level...If it is going to 90 first then one wants to be long.
4412 2018-10-14 22:02:34 A little off on this point. Oil is a commodity and buyers are agnostic about the seller if the price is right.
4413 2018-10-14 22:02:06 Note to self:  When adding motor oil to the car engine, it is best to remember to put the oil cap BACK on the engine BEFORE driving away from the auto parts store parking lot.
4414 2018-10-14 22:02:06 How can I get good quality fish oil? What brand of which oil that you recommend?
4415 2018-10-14 22:02:05 Venezuela's economy proves that US regime change to control OIL reserve (maintain the $ statut) (3 one) is still at work... @economic_hitman The consequence Venezuela's economy , is not the cause.. Mixing cause and consequence.. great job
4416 2018-10-14 22:01:49 Whos your daddy usa? You've been a puppet of wahhabi for decades, the world is not stupid. Now USA what has your economy really got but war as industry. The petrodollar is dead, now what? Blow up saudi, take its oil? That will take 6 months, can US survive? Dump the dollar.
4417 2018-10-14 22:01:49 Hehehehe. 

You're sleeker than eels covered in oil. 

Artful dodger.

4419 2018-10-14 22:01:39 Boycott SA oil. And... deport them from our USA.

4428 2018-10-14 22:01:00 The Tories promised an oil boom if there was a No vote
4429 2018-10-14 22:00:59 Boom/bust is hard-wired in this completely financialised market. If there is one thing that is sure, the oil price will collapse & in my analysis the dollar will fall when it does: the only issue is timing. I don't give a damn who makes money or who loses.
4430 2018-10-14 22:00:55 Connors sells snake oil. Cannot be believed.
4431 2018-10-14 22:00:51 my dad took his truck to the dealership for an oil change but instead they just sent him home with zero oil in the car. currently waiting on a wrecker to come get the truck.
4432 2018-10-14 22:00:47 I bought new wipers, need an oil change soon, need new tires soon, and cleaning my car out tomorrow.

4439 2018-10-14 22:00:02 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!
4440 2018-10-14 21:59:56 And how much of Saudis oil do we buy
4441 2018-10-14 21:59:56 I just said “Alexa, stop” to my essential oil diffuser... that’s how my brains working today just in case u were wondering!!!!!
4442 2018-10-14 21:59:54 I think if Saudi Arabia wants to hurt anyone they're capable to do so...oil has its majeck power..
4443 2018-10-14 21:59:51 We like our medieval times. If you don't need our oil, there are more nations dependent on it, or simply we turn it to petrochemical products.
4444 2018-10-14 21:59:46 Go for damp skin > hyaluronic acid > water based moisturiser. HA absorps up to 1000 times it's own weight in water and goes deeper into the layers of the skin. For really dry skin use an oil base moisturiser. It's a game changer for real. 
4445 2018-10-14 21:59:27 @atiku sir just as flowers open up and bear fruits, just as the moon appears and invariably grows full, just as a lamp becomes brighter when oil is put, And just as plants and trees flourish with rain; so will you never fail to lead this great nation to prosperity again. Amen.

4448 2018-10-14 21:58:56 Bread and groundnut oil
4449 2018-10-14 21:58:55 The main legal liability would be because of the trade agreements we would be violating. To the extent that oil is imported from a country with which Canada does not have a trade agreement, a measure like this might be legally possible.

1/2
4450 2018-10-14 21:58:48 Most of the damage he did to his country was when he was allied with the West.

No one cared then, as he was "our" dictator, working for the interests of the West.

Turn against using the dollar for oil, and he got squashed.

Business as usual.

4459 2018-10-14 21:57:24 Anyway, my scalp is too fucking itchy, tomorrow I'll go to the supermarket to buy some coconut oil so I'll apply it to my scalp to reduce the itching

2h with the oil on my hair, ugh
4460 2018-10-14 21:57:20 Boy are you ever wrong. When has Trump ever backed down? Have you forgotten? It was Obama that bowed down before the Saudi King, not Trump. It might get expensive and inconvenient, but we can produce all our own oil. If they lose 100% of our business, they will regret the threat.
4461 2018-10-14 21:57:19 Money and oil talks loudest.
4462 2018-10-14 21:57:11 Just keep wearing sweatshirts and slippers. I refuse to use oil if I don’t have to
4463 2018-10-14 21:57:11 
4464 2018-10-14 21:57:06 We don't need their oil. Trump admin has expanded U.S. energy production to where we are a net exporter. Dig?

We want economic ties as they are most important. We don't need to impose our values on them.
4465 2018-10-14 21:57:03 A woman tried to sell me some facial oil for blemishes, which I barely have. And I'm looking at her skin like WTF. The oil you sale, doesn't even work on your skin. Her skin was full of acne, blemishes, and uneven tones, yet she trying to sell me her magic potion. #WTF
4466 2018-10-14 21:57:02 Sorry, that was the peppermint essential oil. Little goes a long way, don't it?
4467 2018-10-14 21:57:02 Another reminder, Iran selling oil on the open market as part of the Iran nuclear deal was designed to weaken Saudi Arabia.
4468 2018-10-14 21:56:59 Oil-based cleanser or oil from your face cleanser?  If it's the latter, I've heard good things about salicylic acid products
4469 2018-10-14 21:56:55 Imagine @stephenharper wrong on yet another issue....so not surprising. And also not surprising is @jkenney trying to sell the same old snake oil bullshit.
4470 2018-10-14 21:56:46 I really feel for Ms. Berman. She appears to be the focus of a concerted attack campaign for no reason I can determine. She is merely indicating to us the consequences of ignoring climate change and continuing with our use of oil. It's factual stuff but folks are emotional. Why?
4471 2018-10-14 21:56:46 Take my @ChevyTrucks in for a oil change this week
4472 2018-10-14 21:56:18 Russia has oil
4473 2018-10-14 21:56:18 3.) Yet you obsess on Hillary's emails & server after a Trump Tower Server found in constant contact w/ Kremlin via Alfa Bank all during campaign. 4.) Kushner & Trump leaking Classified Intel to Salman of SA for a piece of Aramico Oil & a loan for Kushner's Bldg at 666.
4474 2018-10-14 21:56:17 Spend the next few days of your life and learn about hydrocarbons. The whole life blood of modern society is based on oil. Without it we would all starve to death. Ignorance is no excuse.
4475 2018-10-14 21:56:04 Last time I checked, we didn't need their oil. Fracking has made us essentially energy independent. The United States will not be threatened, bullied, or blackmailed thanks to President Donald Trump.
4476 2018-10-14 21:56:03 @ the boy who is changing the oil in my car, U R CUTE
4477 2018-10-14 21:56:03 On Palm Oil, there is a need to upgrade research facilities, NIFOR has falling way behind, Okomu & co needs to do vertical integration, not horizontal coz they don't have access to land hence new varieties that will double their current yield which is where NIFOR comes in
4478 2018-10-14 21:55:57 Grease? I use oil.
4479 2018-10-14 21:55:51 We want our economy to rise in renewable Jon's and energy..not coal and oil and EPA deregulations!
4480 2018-10-14 21:55:01 They can keep their oil. We as a country are not financially dependent on SA, Trump and Kushner are. Sanction the crap out of them.
4481 2018-10-14 21:54:52 I’m happy oil out of the ground doesn’t have a ten dollar federal tax per barrel. One man supported it one man voted against it

4484 2018-10-14 21:54:21 Clearly not mother Teresa. Nor Gandhi though. Just shows escalation only makes things worse. So many people looking to throw oil on the fire.
4485 2018-10-14 21:54:20 We are stronger than them expect the military force. We can just destroy the oil &$ agreement.We will sell Oil either by goldor  currency
4486 2018-10-14 21:54:18 Wallahi
4487 2018-10-14 21:54:14 Funny thing is that this cloned video explanation is probably going to stand. Wasn't this how the international snake oil merchant gist was contrived? They collude!
4488 2018-10-14 21:53:56 #Saudi_Arabia is turning out to be a #Rogue state. They have Money and Oil and a murderer as the King.  Horrendous combination.
4489 2018-10-14 21:53:51 Good. U.S. has sacificed our souls, core values and even our sons and daughters for cheap oil for too long.

4493 2018-10-14 21:53:25 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
4494 2018-10-14 21:53:11 These price gouging laws are so fucking stupid. Please gouge gas prices so I can fill my car up instead of the dipshit in front of me emptying the earth oil to fill up his garage with spare gas 5 DAYS AFTER the hurricane
4495 2018-10-14 21:52:52 That's right fools let the Russians in. How could that end badly for your nation? Does Saudi Arabia know they aren't a superpower and that by letting Russia in they are effectively cutting off their nose to spite their face? Also, we really don't buy a lot of oil from them so...
4496 2018-10-14 21:52:45 We don’t buy Saudi oil genius.
4497 2018-10-14 21:52:33 Just trying to get mine. Just like the biotech crazy, oil crazy, ect. People personalize and get wrecked. I do this for money, i donate separately to causes I feel warrant it.
4498 2018-10-14 21:52:28 #MBS says he can turn to Russia if US imposes sanctions. 1. Russia has more oil than Saudi Arabia. 2. Russian weapons and fighter jets will take a decade for Saudis to operate, by which a revolution may already be underway. #Khashoggi #JusticeForJamal
4499 2018-10-14 21:52:21 It’s anyone’s guess, I guess, when they all will wake up and see you for the incorrigible snake oil salesman that you are.
4500 2018-10-14 21:52:19 Andrew Luck is still a major stud despite all of the hits he's taken, injuries he's suffered, and crap he's been through. Yet he still has to put up with an inept roster. Poor guy. At least he goes home to some spiced rabbit stew with a side of peppered squirrel oil.
4501 2018-10-14 21:52:18 What about other countries being affected? Do you think they will be happy if oil hits very high prices? What about Saudi relations with Russia and China? Think about it buddy!
4502 2018-10-14 21:52:01 Now it should clear even to the useful idiots why they attempted to still born shale fracking by killing oil prices and and invested in production of Hollywood propaganda like Promised Land. Now maybe trying to manipulate the market will be a tiny bit more difficult.
4503 2018-10-14 21:51:53 Agreed. Beaten down CDN oil companies are looking better despite the domestic regulatory gong show.
4504 2018-10-14 21:51:48 yummy poisonous coconut oil..
4505 2018-10-14 21:51:46 With the greatest of respect city were a nothing team before your oil money. To see United reduced to a rich mans play thing would be a disaster . We don’t want to be like your lot
4506 2018-10-14 21:51:42 That would be oil?
4507 2018-10-14 21:51:37 Found these cute little genie potion bottle vials that I think I want to start putting my essential oil blends in. 
4508 2018-10-14 21:51:34 Where are all the people who said we don’t need Saudi oil? They were just here, very recently
4509 2018-10-14 21:51:26 They can sit on it n rotate.. Healthy grass fed meat, free range eggs, coconut oil, avocado, grass fed butter, Extra virgin olive oil etc., are very healthy for consumption.. GO LCHF..
4510 2018-10-14 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
4511 2018-10-14 21:51:06 Oh man. The oil paintings of the battle is a nice touch.
4512 2018-10-14 21:50:51 I think Iran has some oil to sell, if Trump would get off the Saudi payroll.
4513 2018-10-14 21:50:18 Wondering how he wants to be seen in India, as an arranged husband whose parents are giving away oil to the highest bidder? do they know he's from a lower caste and he's already married to Ezra?
4514 2018-10-14 21:50:16 China exports crude oil. It resells oil it buys. To places like North Korea, so oil exports aren’t that uncommon. It is just very difficult to track. But as I said you have got part 1 at the moment. Part 2 is where you get the brownie points
4515 2018-10-14 21:50:11 Bring it on!

I’d love the US to sell fewer arms to the Saudi’s

And while we’re at it, let’s keep investing in and selling sustainable energy technology!

We need to be done with oil, the sooner the better!
4516 2018-10-14 21:49:57 I can’t wait for me and my partner to massage argan oil into each other’s curls 
4517 2018-10-14 21:49:54 Coconut oil does magic
4518 2018-10-14 21:49:39 The world should be grateful for Saudi Arabia’s rule in insuring abundance oil supplies at low price. Everyone should stop talking SA for granted
4519 2018-10-14 21:49:37 Bitumen is a type of crude oil.
4520 2018-10-14 21:49:35 Try castor oil It’s good for hair growth.
4521 2018-10-14 21:49:33 Drunkenly text my ex mrs the other day about where to get cloves and clove oil, bizarrely she responded and was nice, so nice to know not every female wants to slit my throat after touching me
4522 2018-10-14 21:49:11 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
4523 2018-10-14 21:48:59 I really want to start using oil paints because they’re just so pretty
4524 2018-10-14 21:48:43 Canada should take page out of Israels book.Those that intend to undermine our country like foreign funded anti oil extremists should be deported and or never let in.#cndpoli
4525 2018-10-14 21:48:36 Big facts.  If we have the history and the oil money..ITS OVER
4526 2018-10-14 21:48:30 That makes me angry for you. :(. CBD oil helps me but it's not a cure all for everyone. I hope you find answers soon and a Doctor that wants to help you get better.
4527 2018-10-14 21:48:17 Saudi is off limits now & Canada is a security risk according to trump, I guess US will have to get oil from their pal Russia or Argentina..what a screwed up president
4528 2018-10-14 21:48:13 Still to be pitied.  Anyone falling victim to the investment snake oil salesmen whether it's mortgaged backed securities, Bernie Madoff investors or this latest farce. "Give us your money, you can trust us."
4529 2018-10-14 21:48:12 Ohh, like there is no oil to be found other place? We do not rely on oil like we did in the past and our dependency will decrease steadily. The future is Technology driven by human creativity which cannot be controlled by an autocrat. Wake up!!!
4530 2018-10-14 21:47:54 MAC, YOUR QUARTER POUNDER IS NOT AS BIG AS ADVERTISED ON BILLBOARDS OR TV. JUST SAYING. IF YOUR A MAC FAN, I FOUND OUT YOU HAVE TO LEAN OVER TO DUMB CASHIER, AND TELL THEM. YOU WANT YOUR BURGER RIGHT OFF THE GRILL. AND YOU WANT YOUR FRENCH FRIES RIGHT OUT OF THE OIL. GOT IT, OK.
4531 2018-10-14 21:47:51 No he will not. Gas prices have long been the reason to court saudis and here we are again held hostage by the oil industry and "gas prices". MBS wasn't he the one who set up the backchannel with russians, prince, and jared over in Sechelles? I think so. All russia all the time.
4532 2018-10-14 21:47:49 Yes. That blister is a mofo! My natural health class recommends lavender oil or hypericum lotion for blisters and burns but I’m not sure if it would be right for this type of injury.
4533 2018-10-14 21:47:48 What can I do, really? We don't need their oil anymore.
4534 2018-10-14 21:47:26 We’ve been told we have strongest most resilient economy in the world. Is this “fake news” ? Why would rest of world want any currency other than USD? Why are we so dependent on a culturally 15th century country.? We’ve been too long at the teat of ME oil. we’re strong, wean off
4535 2018-10-14 21:47:21 I’m seriously starting to think H.A.A.R.P.(google it) is being used on the country of Haiti  
To secure the #Oil reserve found and to secure black #organs 
, no questions asked.
4536 2018-10-14 21:47:13 Sad to see #josiemaran on #qvc got Botox. I thought that argan oil was the secret ??
4537 2018-10-14 21:47:01 Got the '07 #hondashadow Spirit vt1100c back running and leak free. Carbs rebuilt, oil changed, leak patched. Hi to be be riding to work starting Tuesday.
4538 2018-10-14 21:46:45 The same can be said about pretty much any exporter. Very few countries are willing to take such a risk. If China or India were to export crude oil, that would go noticed.
4539 2018-10-14 21:46:44 You can tune in to Radio via internet tho
4540 2018-10-14 21:46:41 Uh, the Saudi's are only the 19th largest economic power in the world, similar to the Netherlands. Oil is their only serious game.
4541 2018-10-14 21:46:30 Yes, on flaming skewers with extra olive oil.
4542 2018-10-14 21:46:23 They are also threatening to trade oil in Yuen. Which really hurts America as we print money (the effects of inflation will be felt sooner)
4543 2018-10-14 21:46:13 Where's our oil? All hat and no cowboy. All bark and no bite.
4544 2018-10-14 21:46:02 Was I d only one who saw the look on her face when she said.. Dan Boroa?  She felt like d guy will know what is means...
Danborba good afternoon people

4546 2018-10-14 21:45:43 my outfit is so cute today but then i got kare kare on it so now there’s an oil stain on my pants
4547 2018-10-14 21:45:38 Oil most likely, mixed with water
4548 2018-10-14 21:45:38 Oops the oil
4549 2018-10-14 21:45:34 It's crazy... If only there were some other place to get oil BUT WHERE
4550 2018-10-14 21:45:32 I loooooove cold wax medium, it’s got that matte look to it and blends satisfyingly similar to oil pastels
4551 2018-10-14 21:45:25 What was crude oil price before/after 2015? How much crude oil was stolen? How many private jets flew to Benin for wedding? How many states were paying salaries? Growing economy with 2,000MW of power utilization, importation of tooth picks & tissue papers?
@Gidi_Traffic
4552 2018-10-14 21:45:06 Michael Ruppert's book " Crossing the Rubicon" foretold US M.I.C. March through the Middle-East; with a map that details the oil reserves.

Saudi Arabia is the largest worldwide.

This event may result in the the US M.I.C. getting the excuse it needs, to go after Saudi Arabi
4553 2018-10-14 21:44:58 What did you think? I didn’t like them at all and my husband loved them. I thought the cream tasted like coconut oil

4556 2018-10-14 21:44:51 WTH?
From Jul-Nov 1944, more than 2,800 US planes bombed oil factories within 45 miles of Auschwitz, on their way, flying right over the railways leading to Auschwitz.On Aug 20 & Sep 13, US bombers hit the industrial zone at Auschwitz itself, just 5 miles from the 4 gas chambers.
4557 2018-10-14 21:44:50 Urban was already rubbing massage oil into Sergei's back in 2017. Who knows, maybe everything that happened in March was to create a better narrative & therefore return on what until then had been rather tedious interviews. 
4558 2018-10-14 21:44:31 Well, we shouldn’t stand oddly by while this is happening. We should declare that future oil sales be done with Yuan instead of $ & wait for $ freefall. We should negotiate with European entities for a possible alternative for arms & nuclear reactors & see who’ll hurt more.
4559 2018-10-14 21:44:27 I do think this tea tree oil is working, I’m going to give it another week and a half
4560 2018-10-14 21:44:17 I usually don’t take a stand on these Props until I’m in the booth.  But all of the “vote no” stuff I’m seeing is sponsored by Oil & Gas and Mining (and @adndotcom which is the same thing).  I’m thinking I’m a yes.
4561 2018-10-14 21:44:15 energetic neutrons.... no need to ruin it for others...
4562 2018-10-14 21:44:01 What Saudi Arabia did to #Khashoggi was sick, then again, what Saudi Arabia does to its people on a daily basis is sick, but nothing will change because there’s too much money to be made in oil trade.
4563 2018-10-14 21:43:44 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,

4564 2018-10-14 21:43:32 Still, doesn't help $200 for a barrel of oil (threat) to anyone, least of all California,  extreme reliance on energy from outside the state.   I pay $2.41 for gas atm, what about you
4565 2018-10-14 21:43:06 Haha I went and asked and then I was like “well I need an oil change so it’s a good thing I’m here and have no excuse now
4566 2018-10-14 21:42:50 But then there’s nothing left to pay the wages and the electric bill plus the oil and green keepers.
4567 2018-10-14 21:42:50 UNCLOS being used to threaten sovereignty of allies & US causing many of problems with China in Pacific as they & the UN scheme to expand China's reach into international waters and attempt to steal United States' world's largest ocean resources, minerals, rare earths oil & gas

4569 2018-10-14 21:42:34 I forgot! Yea, where is that free oil? (And wall)
4570 2018-10-14 21:42:28 I went to Walmart because I needed an oil change and asked them to fill my tires and vacuum for me too

4572 2018-10-14 21:42:22 Is ‘lake fires’ a fire on a lake ? You know, like from an oil spill ? Maybe hell needs to sort out its environmental management.
4573 2018-10-14 21:42:19 Yeah, Saudi Arabia is such a beacon of truth and greatness in the world You got nothing but oil, nothing, except a lot of sand Maybe you can start an export business of sand instead?
4574 2018-10-14 21:42:11 Both cars looked awesome.  Jac looked very much at home in thesister car.  Congrats on your win Rico.
4575 2018-10-14 21:42:05 This is probably a long term EXPENSIVE plan but it’s a thought for the near future to consider.

We need to plan to take better care of Mother Earth because we only have one!

Oil should come with a Tax that goes directly to Green Energy or plans like this, ect...
4576 2018-10-14 21:42:05 It isn't the oil that is the issue for Trump.  It is selling the weapons for all his political backers.
4577 2018-10-14 21:41:37 Teem, you are correct.  No country can protect itself from the Anglo-American Empire and the DC Warlords.  They destroy countries at will.  Example Libya.  Destroyed to turn over oil and weapons.
4578 2018-10-14 21:41:31 Saudi is threatening us with higher oil if we put sanctions on them for killing a journalist?
Do it,buttercup. 
Do it and see how much business you do with non middle east countries.
4579 2018-10-14 21:41:22 OK, New City, New Job... I just joined @PlanetFitness and my grocery list was mainly Ketogenic, plus I picked up a few supplements, Vit D, Magnesium, and Fish Oil to round out the stack.

Spending today on laundry and settling on a fitness plan.

And the Simpsons marathon on FXX!

4581 2018-10-14 21:41:07 This whole fake debate started to stop shoveling money to bankers that never spent a penny.

Fukdafed that is the debate which is a given...

Everyone on the right fell into the Propoganda trap...

We agree, change will come from Ingenuity, not the bankers that own oil companies.
4582 2018-10-14 21:41:07 I need some Cbd oil asap kmt
4583 2018-10-14 21:41:05 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
4584 2018-10-14 21:41:05 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

A lekarza-szarlatana po prostu każdorazowo należy zgłaszać do właściwej OIL. Może się coś wreszcie tam ruszy.
4588 2018-10-14 21:40:33 This would be great. The TAIL wags the dog.,,,,,  MEXICO HAS MORE OIL. cure the border and BUY MEXICAN OIL!
4589 2018-10-14 21:40:28 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
4590 2018-10-14 21:40:26 Russia has collaborated with Iran to pump the oil to Russia & be sold with the profits shared at an agreed %. Russia is trying to undermine the US.
4591 2018-10-14 21:40:16 I strongly feel Atiku has some evil lurking. Nigerians will get tired of hot oil, only to jump out and land right into the flames of the gas cooker.
4592 2018-10-14 21:40:14 We never needed Saudi oil, we have enough resources here!!

4594 2018-10-14 21:40:05 Saudi and khassogi mystery may trigger further rise in oil price media does not discuss it bad for countries, developing, may hit 100& barrel.
4595 2018-10-14 21:39:59 So UK, France & Germany are very upset at Saudi Arabia for allegedly killing 1 journalist but don't give a toss about the blatant genocide in Yemen - what sort of World is this!!! 
Ah yes, it's called OIL!!!
4596 2018-10-14 21:39:51 revealed: every time El Trumpo abolishes a crucial regulation, a butterly whispers #covfefe
4597 2018-10-14 21:39:39 Avenatti seems like a showboater/snake oil salesman. Drop him.
4598 2018-10-14 21:39:27 Yes...preparing to have my oil ready for the Lord too! Bless you for this timely end time teaching!
4599 2018-10-14 21:39:12 Scotland's total contribution to UK Gov (minus oil revenue) is £58.6 billion. Scotland total budget £33.18 billion. London spends the rest "on our behalf" - bombing Syria, building nukes, London Crossrail, HS2 etc. You yes yet? 
4600 2018-10-14 21:38:52 That will happen at some point (maybe now Luke w Petro/Yuan). Can you imagine if a high profile producer like Saudi Arabia decided to sell their oil for silver? Check out the size of the world's Ag market compared to the world's oil market. US should be converting USD to Ag now.
4601 2018-10-14 21:38:49 Try cbd oil
4602 2018-10-14 21:38:30 Just ordered the oil, balm, and wash. Cant wait. I love wood scents.
4603 2018-10-14 21:38:29 Got my pen from Whatever for $22. The oil cartridges start selling for as low as $40 but the ones I get are 97% THC so i pay a little more
4604 2018-10-14 21:38:24 smoke your thc oil slow.. 3x the high
4605 2018-10-14 21:38:14 Saudis seem to fly around the globe with a hell of a lot of impunity don’t they? They think coz they own the oil they own the airways. #whereisjamalkhashogji
4606 2018-10-14 21:38:10 They have NO economy without oil. Let’s see them stop selling it! Lol
4607 2018-10-14 21:38:08 I want mine with the oil and the tissue it will drain inside my tummy don't worry

4609 2018-10-14 21:37:49 I think you're just dishonest with yourself and your viewpoint. It benefits you to hold your viewpoint as I imagine you have enough spare money to spend on fluffy feelgood 'stick it to the man' snake oil like bitcoin. Most people don't have that luxury, so it's pointless.
4610 2018-10-14 21:37:33 What are your facts on being the worlds largest oil producer?
4611 2018-10-14 21:37:27 One of the weakest most impotent presidents ever. A national Jizyah tax payable to ISIS and bus service to U.S border from Guatemala would prob be a thing. Nice guy though.
4612 2018-10-14 21:37:22 I would love to sing it with you David right now.
It would be magic. Used to sing it in infant school and
still remember it. You are as old as you feel,
Night David xx
4613 2018-10-14 21:37:16 Saw this, bro I don’t wamt that oil money.... i want the old traditional United back, nuturing players, playing for the fans, the crest and more importantly football.
4614 2018-10-14 21:37:12 Tea tree oil, hunty
4615 2018-10-14 21:37:06 I  know a country  that has a bit of oil to spare.  Too bad we're a security risk.
4616 2018-10-14 21:37:02 Why is Shell stock price almost never change, even though they have the buy-back programs! Isn’t supposed to get more expensive since there are less shares out there + oil prices are raising immensely?
4617 2018-10-14 21:36:46 Fuck it start carpet bombing and take the oil already
4618 2018-10-14 21:36:28 okay that oil baron voice is the WORST thing I've heard all day and I got chatted up by a 60 y/o man today #LateNightHedd
4619 2018-10-14 21:36:15 That is like equating the oil industry as a whole to Deep Water Horizon.
4620 2018-10-14 21:36:13 Personally I see Saudi as yet another country controlled by the ridiculous clergy and undemocratic tyrants. They have succeeded in nothing except be lucky they sit above oil. I have no respect.
But that oil wealth is why USA won't apply sanctions.
4621 2018-10-14 21:36:05 @MichaelAvenatti when your working late, burning that midnight oil, what kind music do you listen to? You a fan of daft punk?
4622 2018-10-14 21:36:00 I enjoyed Chris' talk! His perspective  was upfront about the econs and environmental concerns surrounding the oil sands, but also brought in that much of the change that needs to happen is already happening at the industry level & that it has to come from individuals as well.
4623 2018-10-14 21:35:55 수상한 배를 가진 수상한 무용
4624 2018-10-14 21:35:51 Agree, and it is clear Saudi-Arabians fear sanctions above all, because they got nothing but oil, finally we can get rid of that insane dictatorship.
4625 2018-10-14 21:35:50 Will come the day Desert sand will take over again...retaliation? Close the tape..man can always walk one oil and sand are not edible
4626 2018-10-14 21:35:44 I hope I'm not the only person who eats cabbage with raw pepper, maggi and oil instead of mayonnaise? I hate that thing 
4627 2018-10-14 21:35:40 Didn’t China just announce they’re not buying our oil anymore?
4628 2018-10-14 21:35:35 Roll on lavender oil is life changing 
4629 2018-10-14 21:35:34 Love it Hied used to sing that a Christmas when I was in church choir boy ,we could change the words, little donkey on a eon road
4630 2018-10-14 21:35:33 I do appreciate the people that have sent me some good beard regiments tho. Definitely coppin the wood comb, Jamaican black castor oil & silk pillow cases in a minute
4631 2018-10-14 21:35:32 The oil companies are loving this. Just went out to refuel my generator and once I shut it down all I could hear was all my neighbor's generators running.
4632 2018-10-14 21:35:27 When they told me that sequence stratigraphy was very important in oil and gas. I wanted to die. One of the worst topics I ever came across in school
4633 2018-10-14 21:35:25 Crude oil has never been up to $200, in the history of crude oil sale!! Where do you pick your data from?
4634 2018-10-14 21:35:05 Just passed a @jiffylube whose sign said “pumpkin spice oil changes are back” and they’ve won the fall
4635 2018-10-14 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this October? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
4636 2018-10-14 21:34:50 I am confused I keep seeing these reports that say we are the now the leading exporter of oil. If so how can Saudi take it to 200 a barrel.  And if they raise the price of oil doesn't that benefit us (at least our oil industry). As long as we protect our on internal oil prices.
4637 2018-10-14 21:34:50 Today's special: star anise rolls with sesame oil salt £66
4638 2018-10-14 21:34:38 Large bun tins .... sunflower oil smoking hot ... beat the daylights out of it leave in fridge an hour or two till your ready then give it another bash before pouring in ..... wack oven up to 200 and never open until ready 
4639 2018-10-14 21:34:36 How does more US extraction help Russia? Their economy is dependent on high oil and gas prices, and their foreign policy is based on their near-monopoly on energy supplies to Europe. The USA becoming an exporter of oil and gas KILLS them.
4640 2018-10-14 21:34:34 I don't take my moisturisers and shit when I go away for the weekend, so just came home and basted my face in everything I have, and as a result I now have bee sting repair oil in my eye....

4644 2018-10-14 21:33:55 Bullshit and bluster. What the AF can they actually do? Plenty of sources of oil. They have nothing else
4645 2018-10-14 21:33:41 What is so special about oil? Would it be soooOoOo difficult to convince the bigwigs to get in early on the solar market that’s about to explode? If so, I hope they ride that sinking ship to the bottom of the irredeemably polluted ocean as the world moves on
4646 2018-10-14 21:33:35 step 1: start wars over oil

4647 2018-10-14 21:33:35 You don't have a clue, noone is subsidizing oil and gas.

4649 2018-10-14 21:33:26 Does Hypocrite Horgan know that there is oil right next door???
4650 2018-10-14 21:33:24 Basically dunked half my hand in 400 degree oil at work so now my hand has been in ice water for hours and still feels like its on fire.
4651 2018-10-14 21:33:20 There’s no room on trains for grain there full of crude oil because you won’t allow any fucking pipelines to tidewater or inter provincially to our own refineries. You better not have shared in Aramco.
4652 2018-10-14 21:33:05 “fuckin A, that’s sesame oil, not olive oil: a story of betrayal and confusion”
4653 2018-10-14 21:33:00 #USA and allies jobs (i.e.Boeing and Airbus) were not considered when #Trump withdrew from the #IranDeal. Trump needed Saudi-led #OPEC and @KremlinRussia_E to make up for loss of #Iranian oil. Russia and Saudi-led OPEC controls Trump's decision on #Khashoggi's death.
4654 2018-10-14 21:32:58 Mashed potatoes with a pot of vegetable oil for dipping!
4655 2018-10-14 21:32:48 It's not a coincidence that she's all of a sudden against Berman and for the oil industry, when  there is an election coming up. Most Albertans won't forget she was on the same side as Berman.
4656 2018-10-14 21:32:46 Today I got my wine rack set up, new A/C vents replaced, oil changed, and ALMOST figured out why my right signal light won’t flash. I’m 3/4’s dad now!

4660 2018-10-14 21:32:32 There is absolutely nothing to understand. Whatever a governor do is none of Buharis business coz they have autonomy and immunity and he wouldn't know what they do with whatever money sent to them until they leave office. Just talk objectively sometimes without hate for this man
4661 2018-10-14 21:32:20 Wasn’t Trump’s philosophy about Iraq to “take the oil?”
4662 2018-10-14 21:32:18 Yes yes a small oil embargo please
4663 2018-10-14 21:32:18 TBQH though ... it'd been so long since I've eaten fast-food fries that ... my body's kinda gone off the oil.

4690 2018-10-14 21:29:23 Are you ignoring that CO2 is WAY common and so WAY more of a problem? It does not matter that pollution can come from other technology because the biggest problem right now is coming from fossil fuels! And there's loads more natural resources to be proud of other than oil.

4693 2018-10-14 21:28:57 Graham Wright is calling from Kingston, Ontario. His daughter suffered a brain injury and has been in the hospital for months, and is on many medications. Wright says that if they can use CBD oil to get his daughter off medications including opioids, he would support that option.
4694 2018-10-14 21:28:55 Yes. CBD oil would be even better.
4695 2018-10-14 21:28:53 Apart from hedging against oil price crash they also know that they're going to run out at some point. Estimates range from 50ish to a 100 years. They learned from the UAE experience and they have more to protect in terms of culture/religious identity.

4697 2018-10-14 21:28:43 Booming for who? Oil companies? corporations that receive tons of tax deductions? We are stuck paying the 1%'ers  fair share. Nickel & dime us to death, take everything .

4699 2018-10-14 21:28:32 Fuck them and their oil! They won't have any buyers if they jack their prices. Trump should tell them that $100 billion in military sales we promised S.A. will now be going to Iran
4700 2018-10-14 21:28:32 ぉﾞあ、すきです、、
4701 2018-10-14 21:28:32 Lower oil prices?  No thanks.  I will take the bus.
4702 2018-10-14 21:28:27 If we started using alternative fuels, we’d end our reliance on foreign oil, at which time we wouldn’t have to deal with this sh!t anymore.
4703 2018-10-14 21:28:26 NOT enough refineries, increasing taxes by governments and some gouging by large oil companies.  We need a few more refineries in BC with a few pipelines going to each one.  I suggest only then will the prices stabilize.
4704 2018-10-14 21:28:19 I dont know. What's your opinion of oil and gas subsidies? The fossil fuel industry is the richest in the world. BTW: every American Gives the industry between $4-5,000 per year in direct subsidies and tax credits

4714 2018-10-14 21:26:32 yeah, but we have strategic oil reserves we could crack open if we had to...
4715 2018-10-14 21:26:29 Amendment 74 is the most overreaching proposal ever - it allows oil and gas (or really any industry) to sue local gov when they try to enact health and safety regulations. This amendment will be an incredibly expensive burden - on taxpayers. VOTE NO #NoOnAmendment74 #copolitics
4716 2018-10-14 21:26:25 “Ethical oil?” Is that like “Ethical con” or “Ethical rocks?”
4717 2018-10-14 21:26:15 @madan3 Please make a video about recent missile deal of buying S400 from Russia & Importing crude oil from Iran using Indian Rupee
4718 2018-10-14 21:26:11 Agreed, fossil fuels are a national security risk. How many wars have we gotten into because we want to control some sovereign country's oil? Wouldn't it be awesome not to have to rely on Middle East dictatorships for energy? We should have a clean energy Manhattan Project!
4719 2018-10-14 21:26:02 Crazy. I was just getting my oil changed and I thought, “man I hope Ariana and Pete are having a good Sunday.”
4720 2018-10-14 21:25:58 All i asked was what do niggas use to grow a healthy, lengthy, strong beard. This old jawn going to say “ well i buy my bf black Castor oil & ever since I’ve seen results. His beard feels so lovely when i ride his face.” Like bitch what ?
4721 2018-10-14 21:25:48 Drinking the Snake Oil?
4722 2018-10-14 21:25:45 Define energy freedom please.  I prefer the term energy democracy actually. Energy democracy allows citizens to own their own source of production.  Can you do this with your “Energy Freedom” or do you need to buy on recurring basis from oil gas utility companies?
4723 2018-10-14 21:25:44 soojin pursued by foreign line oil on canvas
4724 2018-10-14 21:25:40 Can U imagine the law suits from private companies with contracts to purchase foreign oil & outrage from the right if JT said “hence forth I decree foreign oil will no longer be allowed into Canadian ports”? Their heads would explode! Since JT CANT do that it just sounds good.
4725 2018-10-14 21:25:32 Why not use brighter rapeseed oil produced up the road in the Limavady area. Support local produce.
4726 2018-10-14 21:25:18 The Saudis claim the “Kingdom plays an influential and vital role in the global economy.” 
Really ? 
Now that oil is becoming more toxic by the day ?
What else do they have to offer ?
4727 2018-10-14 21:24:50 Well, i create my own...
Jojoba carrier oil with a few drops of Neroli and/or Vetiver essential oils.
It's calming, soothing.and smells so pleasant!
4728 2018-10-14 21:24:42 As America is now the largest producer of Oil in the world or soon will be, this is an empty threat, and we have much more oil to get to in other areas and a President that is not afraid to use our economic might to bring dictators into line, without bribing them.

4731 2018-10-14 21:24:00 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
4732 2018-10-14 21:24:00 It’s easy .... 1 egg,  4 tbl spoons each of flour, water and milk .... pinch salt ...... smoking hot oil before you pour

4734 2018-10-14 21:23:35  did you know it contributed to the excess oil on your face ? I'll do a thread on why over exfoliating is bad
4735 2018-10-14 21:23:32 Interesting figures, though. Saudi may be the largest exporter of petroleum, but it's only 18% of the world's total. But oil and gas account for ~50 per cent of its GDP and ~70 per cent of its export earnings (acc'g to OPEC)

4736 2018-10-14 21:23:30 I sprinkle lavender oil on my pillow.  It’s a relaxing scent.
4737 2018-10-14 21:23:28 How much Saudi oil does the US buy? Canada supplies 40% I believe maybe they could supply what the US buys from the Saudis?
4738 2018-10-14 21:23:28 umm I guess Saudi didn't notice we have enough oil in USA to supply the entire world for over 100 years !
4739 2018-10-14 21:23:23 Lay in bed and I'm wide awake. Brain is switched on. How do I relax and go to sleep? Think I'm in for a long night burning the midnight oil
4740 2018-10-14 21:23:18 The room was sparsely decorated—only some small bales of hay and a few boxes in the corners, with barrels marked containing oil and arrows for the men above in the high levels of the guardhouse. The desk he sat at was a rather simple one, —
4741 2018-10-14 21:23:17 Trump has never been tested like this before. The right move here is to double down on the threats to Saudi Arabia. Look at the Turkish gov't evidence and determine the response. This is the real "hard" decision a president needs to make. is oil+personal business > human rights?
4742 2018-10-14 21:23:10 Just start a HF. 

“So, what’s your strategy?”

“I’m shorting the fuck out of oil until my head explodes.”
4743 2018-10-14 21:22:52 Who authorized Monty pouring oil on himself?
4744 2018-10-14 21:22:44 Anyone trying to change my oil?
4745 2018-10-14 21:22:28 We don’t import oil from Saudi anymore. The US is now an energy exporter.

Fossil fuels’ coming death knell was the reason the Saudis teamed up with Putin and a few other Middle East nations to try and knock America’s green energy initiative out.
4746 2018-10-14 21:22:27 He DOES know that the United States produces the majority of the oil it uses(with Canada and African nations providing a decent chunk of the rest), right? He DOES know that Saudi Arabia has to import a lot of supplies because they have very little arable land, right?
4747 2018-10-14 21:22:14 It also really depends on where. Trumplandia people expect nothing but recesssions and oil/construction/resource gluts. Canadians catch the flu every time America sneezes. Each regional market differs. Meanwhile, media = big urban centric.
4748 2018-10-14 21:22:13 I actually think he has been a productive president. He has been a peshmerga and fought for kurds, hardly a sell out. He didnt get money for kirkuk, didnt get oil, just didnt want blood shed. #freemasum
4749 2018-10-14 21:22:08 I am not sure the process or anything you do for your hair dye but Sally’s has a Semi-Permanent color in a brand called One n Only, Arian Oil. The red is bright and very beautiful and it lasts longer than any other color. Unfortunately my hair just won’t hold red tones lol.
4750 2018-10-14 21:22:04 well my first weed experience was largely underwhelming, probably mostly bc it was just weed oil 
hoping it's not that boring when it's the real thing
4751 2018-10-14 21:21:59 We really shouldnt be debating last admin..we lessen ourselves by defending what we all saw.from phantom oil swap to arms funds heists...to a new coterie of private jet owners in a country with huge human and physical infrastructure deficits..
4752 2018-10-14 21:21:53 I'm carbon neutral. I not only drive an electric car, I own a tree farm that sequesters carbon. I'm "conservative" only in that I believe in personal responsibility, that it's people burning gasoline who are to blame for global warming, not oil companies.
4753 2018-10-14 21:21:53 Republicans don’t see that, they’re owned by big oil.
4754 2018-10-14 21:21:52 If we get off oil, they will have nothing.
THAT is what needs to happen!
4755 2018-10-14 21:21:48 If you’re dad doesn’t tell you to check your oil 27592x before you drive home from college, is he really your dad
4756 2018-10-14 21:21:35 @TankerTrackers can you track oil storage in Western Canada?
4757 2018-10-14 21:21:29 Saudis don't fully control oil prices and we produce enough to sustain our country for a while. They will lose without our consumption
4758 2018-10-14 21:21:28 That escalated quickly.

They’re scared. The USA is now the world’s largest oil producer, so Saudi Arabia just isn’t as important as it once was to the USA. And after decades of depending on oil to fuel its economy, SA is finally trying to diversify. But it’s probably too late.
4759 2018-10-14 21:21:26 can somebody ask dom if he wants a juul pod w thc oil i wanna give one to him but i also dont wanna carry it around tuesday if i dont have to

They don't want to drill for oil they want to buy 1/2 from people that cut Christians heads off Lets change that

Vegetable oil spread
Don’t use a trademark

It’s just margarine anyway
Isn’t it it butter

4762 2018-10-14 21:21:19 NATO member country leaders and others may be making huge money from the Saudi oil but that should not buy their  conscience. World leaders must demonstrate and they are not Judas Iscariot. Money should nevet becloud our sense of judgement to protect humanity. Just views. Thanks.

4765 2018-10-14 21:21:07 #America has plenty of oil, we don't need #SaudiArabia's oil; the USA normally resells any oil they buy from Saudi Arabia, it's not being used by American citizens. No one builds better weapons than the USA; we should cut them off.
4766 2018-10-14 21:21:05 Quite the threat!!  Could it be realistic?? ( Yes, the oil I understand)..,,

South Africa has no oil

4775 2018-10-14 21:20:24 I don't agree with your assessment!  I would CERTAINLY vote for Amendment 6! I know there's some "lumping" but it's still important to give victims rights! I would vote for no offshore oil and no vaping. They may be somewhat unrelated, but I agree with BOTH!
4776 2018-10-14 21:20:21 Basically at this point, my job pays for the roof over my head and senior dog acupuncture + bottles of pills, herbs, powders, cbd oil, etc.

4779 2018-10-14 21:19:57 whew , thats alot, but if it runs great, and you take care of that motor , might last awhile, be sure to put Lucas oil treatment in your oil change , makes a world of difference, I swear by that stuff, been using it for years
4780 2018-10-14 21:19:57 Saudis own Motiva, the largest refinery in the US, in addition, Trump wants lower oil prices...that will never happen ..imho
4781 2018-10-14 21:19:52 Economy has collapsed before APC took over coupled with fall in oil price. Research Venezuela, may be you can relate.
4782 2018-10-14 21:19:50 My house smell like straight oil burners & incense 
4783 2018-10-14 21:19:46 Well supposedly, we have enough oil of our own to sustain ourselves. The Saudi autocracy is our friend only if we maintain our military relationship. Democracy is a threat to their illegitimate royalty. We have nothing in common. Allow their threats to go to fruition.’
4784 2018-10-14 21:19:27 The Washington Post is #FakeNews That’s in bed with Obama, Clintons and John Kerry who stand to get rich off of Iranian oil sales. Just look what they did to the Kavanaugh family. Let’s wait for the evidence before making any judgments. They’ll hate that though.
4785 2018-10-14 21:19:24 If you’re leveraged to oil it’s critical to follow the #Khashoggi murder. Saudi and the twat prince MbS let hubris run wild, can’t undo the murder of Washington Post journalist. Expect chaos - I’m buying cheap oil equities and stepping into cheap lithium plays. #grizzle
4786 2018-10-14 21:19:24 When you try sesame oil on rice and it tastes amazing.. But now you have this after taste and you get hungry again.. 
4787 2018-10-14 21:19:19 Oil and gas are obsolete
4788 2018-10-14 21:19:14 people should teach kids about cars more bc I had no idea how often you needed to get an oil change
4789 2018-10-14 21:19:12 point is that gas is a 'cleaner' fossil fuel that we have. The dream of a fossil free future is a while off and in the meantime we need to provide the 'lesser' pollutant to people otherwise the west will depend on coal and oil
4790 2018-10-14 21:19:11 Not much to think about. A repressive regime that has traded it oil money for US arms deals for decades. A win win in some pols eyes, plus stability in the region. Unless of course, the regime falls apart from internal rot. Civil war or worse.
4791 2018-10-14 21:19:03 Or until they run out of oil, whichever comes first.
4792 2018-10-14 21:19:02 Lol crazy how I actually want the U.S. to invade Saudi Arabia and take all of their oil now

4794 2018-10-14 21:18:45 When your oil cart pen dies so u try to see if your dab pen battery will fit and then it does so you get high and tweet about how it works to let all your other stoner friends know.
4795 2018-10-14 21:18:45 Imagine that person selling you cooking oil at $12... trust me, the feeling will fade away
4796 2018-10-14 21:18:44 S/o the good guys at @Valvoline Oil always taking care of me every time I’m in
4797 2018-10-14 21:18:43 If we need to take a stand, the USA needs to stop importing their oil, not for a week, not for a month, not for a year, but for good, anything less than that is a total delusion, lies, dirty politics, period
4798 2018-10-14 21:18:36 The guy was murdered, dismembered with a bone saw then disposed of... and "unless more details emerge" then they're happy to negotiate with the (apparent) killers to sell them arms & buy oil to further destroy the climate.

I guess they're testing the limits of modern capitalism.

4800 2018-10-14 21:18:05 1-You're wrong on that matter That's wishfull thinking the Saudis could'nt drop the US at this time & the US would'nt allow an Iran KSA rapprochement That's a no go 
As for increasing the price of Oil If it jeopardizes the US economy MBS life would'nt be worth a token
4801 2018-10-14 21:18:03 Am I an adult yet? I impressed a cashier with the strategy of putting olbas oil in a diffuser
4802 2018-10-14 21:17:58 Looool. They don’t have as much as you think. They were rapidly burning through their money in that small oil down turn.
4803 2018-10-14 21:17:57 And when it breaks down
or starts to annoy
or grinds when it moves
and gives you no joy
'cos it's eaten your hat
or had sex with your cat,
bled oil on your floor
or ripped off your door
and you get to the point
you can't stand any more:
4804 2018-10-14 21:17:37 Do you people even know what cheese actually is at Bloomberg? It's definitely not processed vegetable oil.  Nice headline morons.
4805 2018-10-14 21:17:35 This week's to-do list:

4806 2018-10-14 21:17:26 I can’t wait to get home and plug in my oil diffuser and finish my book on green magic and eat fresh popcorn and hang my eucalyptus branches 
4807 2018-10-14 21:17:22 Oh do I ever! Many friends lost their homes due to layoffs and not just the oil industry but carpenters etc. Very high mortgage prices. Think ours went to 17%. Scarey reminder Marton.

4811 2018-10-14 21:16:55 No but you can plant trees, fly less, VOTE for representatives who are not afraid of scientific data and who are not boughr by big oil!  You have no idea how BAD this will be regarding extreme temps, no pollinating insect food shortages, civil unrest, drought, frequent storms....

4813 2018-10-14 21:16:51 Let's see; we have an oil war in the Greater Middle East, a drug war south, and we are outraged at the exodus called "the immigration problem".  Beautiful; start wars, then make billions fighting war.  How did that Saddam-9/11 involvement turn out?  What shape is Libya in now?
4814 2018-10-14 21:16:49 So gotta wait till 2050 ? Hooefully by then the dependency of world on oil be 0%
4815 2018-10-14 21:16:47 It won't. Public sector workers would just get 1 more paid day off is all.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
4817 2018-10-14 21:16:45 You can't EAT COAL & you can't DRINK OIL And U R not responsible 4 giving them good stable land 2 frack 2 death & make a profit from. U R NOT OBLIGATED 2 give them profit!!!
4818 2018-10-14 21:16:39 It’s actually horrifying what could be triggered from this. Can you imagine how fu*ked off the Orange Mess will be if they sink his economy with oil price hikes?? Fuc*ked off enough to start a war I’d say. He’s already pretty mad about maybe losing these deals ....
4819 2018-10-14 21:16:35 So the enemy of the Ayatollahs and Putin enemies [US and Arab countries] is their friend [Al-Qaeda]. It's geopolitical, the Russian and iran regimes prefer instability and chaos because the US interests are in stability. Basic math, Russia, Qatar and Iran are top oil & gas powers
4820 2018-10-14 21:16:31 Hot Tree Oil Treatments.
4821 2018-10-14 21:16:26 They use their oil power to be just as bad as North Korea or Russia while still currying favor with the West. We need to cut them off and make them feel the pain they deserve.
4822 2018-10-14 21:16:14 KSA is not the major US oil supplier. Our friends in Canada, who Trump has insulted regularly, are.
Tell MBS to keep his oil and use it as lube when he gets his head shoved up his ass.
He was a murderer before Khashoggi, nothing has changed.
4823 2018-10-14 21:15:56 because of the wonderful things he does 
4824 2018-10-14 21:15:56 Saudia Arabia to world: “Would be a shame if something bad were to happen to your oil dependent economies. Maybe look the other way while we kill people next time.”
4825 2018-10-14 21:15:55 Everybody saying quake album weak. Bet give it 1 week, oil y'all in the club like "Pop Pop Soda Pop"
4826 2018-10-14 21:15:47 Few here seem aware the US has become self-sufficient in oil due to fracking.  

Reminds me how IG Farben's synthetic fuel and rubber production potential (with slave labor) assured Hitler Germany could blockade Europe and sustain war for quite some time without access to ME oil.
4827 2018-10-14 21:15:47 Groovy buddy I dig, that'll be soo cool! Tax deductible biz costs, to reduce this year's tax bill, gotta be worth a web search; all those oil ruined towels, that replacement massage bench etc. Food for thought...  
4828 2018-10-14 21:15:35 And now the dollar is backed by the oil. If countries decide to sell the oil with different currency, we are going to say RIP America
4829 2018-10-14 21:15:32 A’s wearing his glasses today & he was kissing my face & his lenses brushed against my face & OBVIOUSLY i am OILY bc oily skin + facial oil & he took off his glasses to show me the oil  let me live ok i’m gonna age so gracefully BYE
4830 2018-10-14 21:15:25 Except the US gets most of their oil from Canada....or they supply their own. *smh*
4831 2018-10-14 21:15:09 Whats clear is the biggest income tax break to workers and it wont be suspended.

Taxes run govt, hence the oil excise tax in exchange. But wait, oil tax will be suspended as NEDA says it has agreed to heed call for its suspension.

Hope these are clear reasons for optimism.
4832 2018-10-14 21:15:07 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
4833 2018-10-14 21:15:06 What’s disgusting is that Cdns continue to burn Saudi oil. More oil is used in central & east Canada than anywhere else. I don’t hear anyone denouncing THAT. Why is that?
4834 2018-10-14 21:15:00 Wait. Who created the Taliban to fight the Soviet’s? Who installed Gadaffi? Who installed the house of Saud? Why was it all done? Oil........The French and British did it mostly. Creating countries where they didn’t exist....west has a lot to answer for.

4847 2018-10-14 21:13:55 Masterchef Australia is pretty good for this, as they have frequent mystery boxes, where they get a bunch of staples (oil, several flours, sugar, eggs, vinegar, milk, cream). eight other ingredients (use at least one), and an hour.  Expected to look good, not ridiculous.
4848 2018-10-14 21:13:55 So typical unfortunately.
You know, @FareedZakaria comment “Saudi Arabia can dig holes in the ground and pump out oil but little else” back in 2015 is what inspired my book...to prove him wrong
4849 2018-10-14 21:13:43 Old motorcycles & parts make very black smoke (oil & grease).
4850 2018-10-14 21:13:22 Don't we have our own oil? Asking from an oil state.
4851 2018-10-14 21:13:18 Riyadh’s plan: IPO, sell shares of state-owned Aramco 2 public 2 finance vision-2030 & make SA economy less dependent on oil.

Success of IPO relies on state of oil, equity markets at time of road show 4 marketing IPO. Higher oil prices=easier sell 2 institutional inv. at high $.

4858 2018-10-14 21:12:42 Wala na agad lawton hahaha wala nading pila sa sea oil badtrip
4859 2018-10-14 21:12:41 We can get our oil from Israel if our own supplies diminish.  The Leviathan site is pumping.  The 6th Fleet is in Haifa and the Saudis can fuck off.  And other than Israel, the ME already is in the pockets of Russia and Iran.
4860 2018-10-14 21:12:39 So far this month, only 4 of the 18 crude oil departures we've so far verified coming out #Iran have kept their AIS transponders online during departure. We are keeping watch on a lot more vessels, but can say that October makes September look like a walk in the park. #OOTT
4861 2018-10-14 21:12:39 It’s not got oil on it
4862 2018-10-14 21:12:35 #EnergyEast could replace oil supply domestically that is currently shipped from Saudi to Canada via tanker on the St. Lawrence seaway #TransMountain is needed for external shipments to generate revenue and jobs domestically for Canada's oil industry.
4863 2018-10-14 21:12:35 Similar to Paleo: eliminate grains, flour, sugars, processed foods, unsaturated oils, grain oils, seed oils, chemicals/pesticides. Cook with butter, coconut oil or olive oil. Drink whole milk instead of skim. Get midday sun or take 4-6000 IU Vit D3/day. Intermittent fasting. Etc
4864 2018-10-14 21:12:23 And not a damn thing is going to be done by this Admin to punish Saudi.

Not because they can raise oil prices, not because they won't buy more arms from the USA, but because Trump has business interests in Saudi Arabia.

MAGAts..... How does this help you? How is this "winning"?
4865 2018-10-14 21:12:15 Europe will do anything for their oil to include getting into bed with the Russians and Iran.

4870 2018-10-14 21:11:44 And who would buy their oil?  There’s so many to buy oil from.  Do Americans really like blackmail?

4872 2018-10-14 21:11:35 Xanthan is a thickener/stabilizer. It forms a weak shear thinning fluid gel that helps prevent oil and water from coalescing. The Arabic is an actual emulsifier making it easier for the two phases to coexist. In particular Arabic is good over a range of dilutions and temperatures
4873 2018-10-14 21:11:34 1. The US is not going to levy sanctions on the world’s largest oil producer and a long time US partner. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. But there will consequences.
4874 2018-10-14 21:11:07 Canada can’t say much - the east coast, Que & Ont burn Saudi oil; Ont builds LAVs; there you have it - @JustinTrudeau STRONGLY denounces this and that - then we have Cdn “”” crickets  “”” echoing the US silence. Altho, no crickets, whatsoever, when it comes to denouncing Alta oil
4875 2018-10-14 21:11:06 The one thing holding back Fusion is the Oil Industry all the best Ideas get grabbed by the Oil Giants and get put away for a rainy day , Except the Germans and the british who are carrying on and will one day crack it (I hope)

4879 2018-10-14 21:10:47 I’m quite happy if we don’t export our oil, water, energy- electricity, whisky, gin and food etc to England..we will find other EU countries to export too and our Celtic cousins. I am sure England doesn’t need us at all... #DissolvetheUnion #indyref2
4880 2018-10-14 21:10:47 Since oil is plentiful, not sure his threats make much sense.  Also, hard to imagine Saudis now become Iran’s friend.  More likely, Trump caves and moves on.
4881 2018-10-14 21:10:44 ALL energy could be switched over to Solar and Wind, but the oil companies are using their hold over Congress to prevent that from happening as the continue to exasperate Global Warming in order to gain as much money as possible before we stop it.
4882 2018-10-14 21:10:29 More Iranian oil for India
4883 2018-10-14 21:10:22 Plenty of existing tech to wean us off foreign oil. Solar is rapidly expanding, imagine what it could do with the full backing of the US gov.

4891 2018-10-14 21:09:43 If only successive Nigeria governments had invested the money it had made wisely rather than embezzle it at this very point there should already be a clearly defined initiative and real tangible evidence of its economy transitioning away from oil production.

Many peeps who’ve never worked in the industry have no clue how much charity is given to our schools, towns, Native Bands, etc. The amount of cash given back is staggering. No other industry gives to communities like Ab oil sector. 
4908 2018-10-14 21:08:20 Let's not equate science with religion.

Global warming is happening, and will kill lots of people.

But the snake oil socialists, who want to build a global authoritarian panopticon to solve it, can fuck off.

I'll take climate disaster over that hellscape any day of the week.
4909 2018-10-14 21:08:20 Don't we produce more oil then we import from the Saudis at this point?
4910 2018-10-14 21:08:17 That's why it makes sense for Saudi to value oil in gold, since the true value of gold has been suppressed to put it lightly. The only thing that would make more sense is for the Saudi's (or anyone else) to sell their oil for silver. Either one would be the equivalent of $500 oil
4911 2018-10-14 21:08:16 Hey L Houlihan - CBD Oil(@doil_cb), thank you for following me
4912 2018-10-14 21:08:13 6. The US can do financial sanctions to but the Saudis have been contemplating selling oil in other currencies aside the dollar for sometime, it will just push them over the cliff which is what the Russians and Chinese have been working towards. UScwill lose big time anyway.

4915 2018-10-14 21:07:49 Olbas oil is such a game changer when you’ve got a cold
4916 2018-10-14 21:07:16 That's amazing. It looks like the effect of floating oil paints on water and laying paper on top.

4920 2018-10-14 21:07:07 Lol yeah ok you don’t need oil .. living in denial must be very enjoyable for you .. have you ever wondered why the Saudi US relation been going for all those years? Give it a thought that might wake you up a bit
4921 2018-10-14 21:07:05 Yeah the economy is booming for the 1% but what about the rest of us gas prices up food prices up oil prices up but my paycheck didn't go up economy booming my ass
4922 2018-10-14 21:07:02 damn WWE gave them oil niggas they money back?

4924 2018-10-14 21:06:36 $200 oil will make fracking very profitable. Look for a dramatic increase in fracking as oil goes over $100.
4925 2018-10-14 21:06:29 Bring it on... It'll be excellent for the environment and teach people to use cars less.... Those of us who remember the oil crises in the 70s have some training...

4927 2018-10-14 21:06:15 There’s nothing sound in Saudi’s war with Yemen in the first place which warrants US’ support other than to sell arms for Saudi’s oil money
4928 2018-10-14 21:06:14 Just don t buy their oil.
4929 2018-10-14 21:06:14 Hey L Houlihan - CBD Oil(@doil_cb), thank you for following me
4930 2018-10-14 21:06:14 Love this man, a favorite of mine. All that adrenaline & he was still a gentleman, he didn’t hit olive oil, that took much restraint, she picked up a stick that her Feral boyfriend had. Followed our guy as he walked away with her fly trap going.
4931 2018-10-14 21:05:50 What barrel, may I ask?  We do not really need "their" oil. Haven't for quite awhile actually.
4932 2018-10-14 21:05:48 And he’s been smoking that Oil
4933 2018-10-14 21:05:48 I’ve smoked PTSD/depression and anxiety busting cannabis sativa for a good while now, and with my tolerance has increased and a number of negative side effects have emerged. Vaporising has been unsuccessful so stopping THC & only having CBD oil drops will be my way from tomo!
4934 2018-10-14 21:05:44 Chemtrail plane burning bioactive oil designed to seed clouds with droplets that cause severe cases of the munchies. Those planes are invisible to non-military radar.
4935 2018-10-14 21:05:38 Technically it’s the most important factor in the economy. It’s politically untenable to mess with oil prices... as sad as that sounds.
4936 2018-10-14 21:05:28 I follow the rules like I have a stick up my butt. I do not appreciate the insinuation. I live in Utah, so probably have even more laws than you.

The CBD oil I use is made from hemp. A different plant than where you get mj from. There are also distillates. No THC.

...
4937 2018-10-14 21:05:20 @RachelNotley why do we send our unrefined oil to the US why not refine it ourselves and sell it to them as a finished product why do we need Texas  refineries is that we stupid  Canadian don't know how or is it political?
4938 2018-10-14 21:05:12 9/11 .. and why ..3 people came from saudi. And US gave them 1930 their legislative monarchy rights when they attacked Medina and Mecka so the oil supplies could keep on coming , Now they threaten US to sell 7 billions of assets invested in us . tRump will not anything.! Coward
4939 2018-10-14 21:05:02 I'm not sure and could be wrong but. I wreckon it's because Saudi Arabia has lots of oil, buys lots of weapons and hates Iran and that political gain could be made by withholding privy council reports from Jeremy Corbyn. I'm wrong though rite, let me be wrong.
4940 2018-10-14 21:04:47 I was almost alone 20 yrs ago, arguing against peak oil myth, all that happens, is as existing stocks start peaking, it gets more valuable, so technology gets developed and it gets cheaper again. There are about 300 yrs of oil in coal desposits etc etc
4941 2018-10-14 21:04:45 U.S. crude oil may not have been on China's tariff list but regardless, it stopped importing in August, according to Bimco, a shipowners association.
4942 2018-10-14 21:04:39 Uhm. No. Saudi Arabia doesn't control the oil price on their own. Doesn't work like that.
4943 2018-10-14 21:04:33 Um- oil? Um- investments? Um- weapons purchase? Lose those three and you rich people ain't so rich anymore, eh?
4944 2018-10-14 21:04:18 I have no idea. I don't think it is irresponsible of Ms. Bergman to gently suggest ways to limit our use of oil. I guess some of us don't think this is worthwhile.
4945 2018-10-14 21:04:01 He was in the middle of returning a favor by getting Iranian oil off the markets so the Saudis and Russians can control the global market space...and price..til MBS f’d that up!
4946 2018-10-14 21:04:00 Good luck! Be sure to be pushy and call them up frequently to see if they got your app. Squeaky wheel gets the oil first lol

4948 2018-10-14 21:03:34 When I lived with my mum, she always used to say to me, don't have the hob on too high when using the frying pan, and I never listened, I now find myself telling Ethan to have it on low because the oil splashes  everywhere and it's a bitch to clean up
4949 2018-10-14 21:03:33 Some things are more important than the price of Saudi oil.
4950 2018-10-14 21:03:30 I'll tell u what as soon as I can I'm going to try CBD oil. I have noticed different things over the past 3 years ive had problems with. I grew up a marijuana smoker. Still passed HS. Still went to college had cut back which now I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't have.
4951 2018-10-14 21:03:23 and then his trousers fell down.
4952 2018-10-14 21:03:17 I will also say try and use liquid (marinade etc) even if it’s a little oil. The airfryer uses a fan and seasonings can get blasted around, if not dried out. We love it during the summer. Especially nice to use instead of the oven.  It’s fun to experiment!
4953 2018-10-14 21:03:15 Saudi Arabia imports services. Luxuries. They pay well. We buy their oil and pay well.
4954 2018-10-14 21:03:13 Canada we have our own oil I don't know about US not to rely to buy their oils If US doesn't rely on KSA oil then US has no fear to give a sanction to KSA only US will loses is 120 billions deals with Amo to sell to KSA
4955 2018-10-14 21:02:58 What are they going to do! We can walk in anytime we wanted and blow them off the map! We don’t need their oil so what’s the alternative for them except to shut-up!
4956 2018-10-14 21:02:54 Although the US is the current leader in oil production our economy and the American desire for cheaper fuel leave him or any president in a bind until we are less dependent on the Saudi’s.  Sad but true.
4957 2018-10-14 21:02:41 Turki Aldakhil, GM of Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, warns that if US imposes sanctions on Riyadh "it will stab its own economy to death," cause oil prices to reach as high as $200/barrel, lead Riyadh to permit Russian military base and drive ME into the arms of Iran.
4958 2018-10-14 21:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
4959 2018-10-14 21:02:29 I’m SO engrossed in #TheCry, that last couple of minutes couldn’t even be spoilt by my husband bursting into the front room and yelling “I’ve put too much coconut oil on my butt.” I’m not sure how to deal with that tbh...probably best I leave him to it...
4960 2018-10-14 21:02:23 Oh, really??? Like how? More highjackers?? Never understood why US is so friendly to these thugs! And don’t tell me oil!  There’s a big ass desert full of sun in the south!! #GOP #DNC #Khashoggi #maga #BlueWave2018
4961 2018-10-14 21:02:19 You would be amazed how close in  bad winters the uk comes to running out of gas...first we need energy independence then we work on a furure with renewables to overlap oil and gas... Min 20 to 30 years to overlap ...ok im done...cheers.

4965 2018-10-14 21:01:38 my thinking on this is very simple, there is a finite amount of carbon on earth and a subset of that is actively cycling through the carbon cycle in various forms (methane, the main greenhouse gas CO2, plants, animals, dead things, etc) the rest is stick in the ground as oil/coal
4966 2018-10-14 21:01:35 The United States only originates about 15% of our oil from the Middle East most of its Canada and South America.
4967 2018-10-14 21:01:33 You can make your own. You just need oil, salt and potatoes. My sister who's a health nut and pegan says that baking is better than frying. So, do that.
4968 2018-10-14 21:01:31 Ah.. retaliate with!  Oil you say?  Iran be more than happy to oblige and fill in the gap and short coming...what else he got?   LOL...

4984 2018-10-14 21:00:05 He needs to stop and think ( I know, right? ) what would happen if Saudis stopped selling us their oil.,,
4985 2018-10-14 21:00:05 The oil market reform to come out of 1973, with almost all oil sold through secondary markets, ended the era of oil oligopoly.  The writer’s ideas were valid when Al Haig ran the war in Vietnam.
4986 2018-10-14 20:59:57 2) European s colonized other weak countries to suck the land's rich minerals and oil, and enslaved them... If those people, after having political and economical problems decide to immigrate in big numbers, Europeans have to accept them. They were the cause of their woes ...
4987 2018-10-14 20:59:52 US and Saudi Arabia trade war erupts.  Dysfunctional relationship ends.  Oil prices skyrocket.  Governments and companies around the world forced to drastically adjust energy policies.  Climate change accidentally fixed.  C’mon dominos....
4988 2018-10-14 20:59:51 Oh Beto does not agree with Oil & Gas industry. Well guess what Beto Texas is the biggest Oil & Gas industry of the World. It is what booms the Texas economy. Vote for Cruz on November 6. Keep Texas's economy booming.
4989 2018-10-14 20:59:48 Canada looses $50,000,000 daily in Oil differentials, annually $506 Person. 2018 carbon guideline price equates this to individuals paying for >50 Tons of Carbon. Our carbon footprint is 16 tons! Our Pipeline policies mean a tax already exists on energy that equates to >$30 a ton
4990 2018-10-14 20:59:32 Oil companies have had tremendous power and influence for over a century, and they won’t give it up easily
4991 2018-10-14 20:59:31 i need tea tree oil
4992 2018-10-14 20:59:23 @SHOPCHEAPYXO AMIGA TRAS SNAKE OIL PRA VENDER NO BRASILLLLL
4993 2018-10-14 20:59:15 After driving through the @Kroger parking lot at Oil Well and Stonebrook and then the @sonicdrivein parking lot on Vann Dr I decided to nominate my town for paving assistance from @dominos #pavingforpizza #JacksonTN #potholesthatturnintosinkholes
4994 2018-10-14 20:58:54 *places another kiss to your cheek once you are naked and moves to add the orange oil to the steaming water*
4995 2018-10-14 20:58:53 I definitely volunteer...
Too bad I can't go anywhere & I would rather you be safe than risking it all trying to get some oil all over your body from my God given talented hands.
You deserve to know the "Touch of Life" is real.
4996 2018-10-14 20:58:38 You think NEED refers to Oil or Money?
Saudi Arabia is your heavy weight in the power balance on earth , the only true valuable ally.
• we sell our Oil electively for US dollars, what would happen if we sell it for Yuan or Ruble or even SR, we support & protect your economy.
4997 2018-10-14 20:58:35 Al Gore=Snake oil salesman.
4998 2018-10-14 20:58:30 IT IS TIME, twitter. I put the winter comforter on the bed and...sigh...turned on the heat.  I love autumn but I'm still not in love with a heating oil bill.
4999 2018-10-14 20:58:30 才馬「お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！」
英文：Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!
5000 2018-10-14 20:58:21 CBD oil. Please give it a try 
5001 2018-10-14 20:58:18 Restrictions on oil production, steel, coal, large machinery and excavation equipment, plus the eliminating tariifs undermined US production. Petroleum make much more than fuel, like plastics. Stopping forestry which caused numerous other issues besides job loss.
5002 2018-10-14 20:58:18 a PR stooge for oil and gas says what?
5003 2018-10-14 20:58:12 That’s exactly the point.. how long could Saudi Arabia finance its budget without oil revenues? (Or with substantially reduced revenues)
5004 2018-10-14 20:58:08 But #DonTheCon can always ask his master vlad for some oil
5005 2018-10-14 20:58:05 People really think white folks don’t be poor.. This lady in Firestone asking if they still have $19.99 oil changes cus she don’t have put $26 til she get paid Tuesday.. She living check to check outchea 
5006 2018-10-14 20:57:52 Preventing bloodshed isn’t a sign of weakness. He didnt gain anything from Kirkuk,The rest did as they have shares in oil,he was the only not selling kirkuk but wanted peace #freemasum
5007 2018-10-14 20:57:48 Yip, memes, sound bites.... blah blah blah. Enjoy your snake oil.
5008 2018-10-14 20:57:37 His obsession with the oil & money! It will be revealed a boil is festering. Every hole can’t be filled. Leakage is inevitable. Voting is not going to be enough to end this scourge. A multi faceted strategy has to be implemented.
5009 2018-10-14 20:57:31 The dude down the street has olive oil and bags of brown rice!!!
5010 2018-10-14 20:57:17 3: If needed, supplement with an omega-3 source like fish oil.
5011 2018-10-14 20:57:12 The enemy wants more than you, he wants your territory. (Family, Finances, Favor)
Anoint your house with oil, oil is representing the Holy Spirit!!
Pray over and cover your territory!!
Get to a point where we won't let the enemy have nothing in my territory!!~@GeorgeWestlake
5012 2018-10-14 20:57:05 Oil will never go that high.
Trump has opened the coasts to drilling.

The poor already pay 3.19 ,to

4 for gas. If they are not already on the bus.

The Saudis are bluffing.

They will say he went to Arabia and died of natural causes. Then donate money to his family. case closed
5013 2018-10-14 20:56:57 As if?????????? Unless the dependence on Saudi oil, investment $$ and trade in arms can be eliminated they will continue to go on murdering, with impunity, inside and outside their borders.
5014 2018-10-14 20:56:53 Electric lines, gas and oil pipelines, roads, & other public uses often take lands through eminent domain. Why not trails?
5015 2018-10-14 20:56:51 LRT: the fact that high school oil well was decommissioned 2 years ago does very little to absolve the absolute absurdity of that situation IMO
5016 2018-10-14 20:56:43 I need to change my oil so I called my dad but he lives in corpus &he tells me “you don’t have any loser guy friends that will do it for you” 
5017 2018-10-14 20:56:15 Let’s put in perspective the price in human lives and the impact on the planet to keep things objective .i think we reached that point in humanity where we can stop dependence on oil and start using heavily the infinite resources of energy
5018 2018-10-14 20:56:02 So far your bearish view on oil has been terrible....Total money losing idea.
5019 2018-10-14 20:55:55 Their threat is to global economy. US will be affected regardless of how much oil they have.Another danger of going to war with everyone at the same time (even your allies) - Reduces options of dealing forcefully with real threats. Getting out of Iran deal sounds more stupid now.
5020 2018-10-14 20:55:42 I love this AU I have, though -- literally everything is the same except nothing is made out of ink

Bendy is made of gasoline, Alice is toxic waste, Boris is water, the Lost Ones are amber, the Searchers are oil, etc.

It's fun to draw :>
5021 2018-10-14 20:55:40 fuck college i’m tryna be an oil tycoon
5022 2018-10-14 20:55:35 where do I apply to work as the 3d models used in snake oil infomercials
5023 2018-10-14 20:55:24 With Tesla outselling i.c.e in America time is running out for Your backwards country. When people no longer need oil the only thing you will export is sand and camels .. and the world has enough sand ..
5024 2018-10-14 20:55:22 One of the most frustrating parts about watching people fall for the alt-right/neo-nazi talking points is that the fascists selling this snake oil so transparently don't have an actual plan beyond

1. Get rid of (minority group)
2. [SCENE MISSING]
3. Life is better somehow???
5025 2018-10-14 20:55:21 Yes plenty oil & gas already....We certainly don’t need to start drilling yet more wells & develop yet another #fracking gas field #climatechange #IPCCReport
5026 2018-10-14 20:55:18 MR. PRESIDENT. THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT. YOU CANNOT LET THESE CAMEL JOCKYS TO GET AWAY WITH DIRECTING THESE THREATS AT THE USA. YOU NEED TO KICK SOME SAUDI A**. THEIR ACE CARD IS OIL. WE HAVE OUR OWN OIL. LET'S GET IT ON SIR.
5027 2018-10-14 20:55:17 Do they know how fast you can drill a shale oil well?
5028 2018-10-14 20:55:13 Raise our oil Saudis?
Protect yourselves from Iran
5029 2018-10-14 20:55:01 Difficult, along the lines of:

JPEGMAFIA - Veteran
Infernal Coil - Within a World Forgotten
Denzel Curry - TA13OO
Funeral Mist - Hekatomb
SOPHIE - Oil of Every Pearl's Un-insides
5030 2018-10-14 20:55:00 Depending on who is in office and filling their pockets with Big Oil money.
5031 2018-10-14 20:54:57 Tracy is awesome and the products are amazing! I received a coconut lip oil and a charcoal mask for hosting a party. The lip oil smells and feels amazing and the mask left my skin feeling so refreshed! Highly recommend her and These products :)
5032 2018-10-14 20:54:54 Absolutely but the guy can only kick from 42 and under, so if he's not doing oil changes at a local jiffy lube next week then the Bears are nuts
5033 2018-10-14 20:54:53 Greetings and salutations welcome oil to the enlightened Kingdom
5034 2018-10-14 20:54:53 @protectcolorado Thank you I will be voting #yeson112 because I am not fooled by all the money oil and gas companies are spending to spread false info so rich people can frack. Glad you are paying politicians and local people to endorse your fake and false campaign #coloradovote
5035 2018-10-14 20:54:53 Parth patanjali hair oil ka brand ambassador bann gaya hain! Lagta hain Isko bhi regular jannnnnnnaaaaaat se maalish ki aadat hain! And his attire - please koi mera Mooh Na khulawayein 
5036 2018-10-14 20:54:52 lol it was! butter + olive oil + pine nuts + lemon
5037 2018-10-14 20:54:50 Have a look in google as to what it would take to replace all oil and gas fuels in the world today... take nuclear out aswell and we are in troble...nice chatting. Cu.
5038 2018-10-14 20:54:44 I would say ummm try brushing ur hair before u go to sleep and if you wash ur hair tomorrow,today you might try to put few drops of argan oil then massage your scalp in order to stimulate your hair follicles. It depends on the hair.
5039 2018-10-14 20:54:08 Our beard oil drops next week! 
TELL A FRIEND
5040 2018-10-14 20:54:06 Fold in three liters of olive oil then raise the temperature.
5041 2018-10-14 20:54:01 Hey Coloradans - vote #NoOnAmendment74 okay? The goal is to allow Oil and Gas (or really any industry) to override health and safety decisions made by your community by draining all your community’s resources in court. It is incredibly terrible for local governance. Vote no on 74
5042 2018-10-14 20:53:58 Too many to list. But a simple answer would be; reversed every policy Obama put in place. That's cutting regulations and tax cuts just those to alone have started back the oil & gas, and coal industries. That's jobs. Not food stamps.
5043 2018-10-14 20:53:57 Maybe new news for gas and oil but old news for green vs 'brown' electrons..
5044 2018-10-14 20:53:48 Read this as “heating oil” and thought “gross”.
5045 2018-10-14 20:53:47 Furthermore, climate policy is much more than CEQA, which also affects freeway proposals, timber harvesting, oil & gas drilling, sprawl, etc. Industry wants CEQA gutted but routinely overstates its effect, relying on anecdotes and ignoring or twisting data.
5046 2018-10-14 20:53:47 Try lavender oil too 
5047 2018-10-14 20:53:47 Didn't we sell Uranium to Putin? How many people has he killed now? Isnt Merkel making oil deals with him? And wasn't Gaddafi also our friend who shot down a passenger plane? And Saddam who gassed his own people?
5048 2018-10-14 20:53:43 Olive oil, vanilla, spices.
5049 2018-10-14 20:53:39 Good snake oil salesmen know how to appeal to emotion.
5050 2018-10-14 20:53:36 It’s the sale of weapons to the Saudis that worries Trump. It’s not about oil.
5051 2018-10-14 20:53:35 Oil is getting to their head
5052 2018-10-14 20:53:02 How is it disingenuous? Our oil industry treats its workers better than any other jurisdiction in the world. You think workers in Saudi are treated well? Weak, pathetic argument.
5053 2018-10-14 20:52:51 He's just a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a carnival barker... how many times do you need to be fooled before you realize this man is making a fool of you? 

His role is give cover the Rs. While we all focus on him, the Rs push forward. 

Stop giving this guy the mic.
5054 2018-10-14 20:52:45 Can agree with the soothing music part. Helps me out a lot when nothing else works. I'd also suggest some lavender oil on a tissue and put it under your pillow. Should help with the anxious mind.
5055 2018-10-14 20:52:43 Thank you. I didn’t even really know what to buy, so oil is what I’m looking for!
5056 2018-10-14 20:52:41 Did the Saudis really think that in this day and age they could just kill someone, journalist or not just because they have OIL they can do anything they want.
5057 2018-10-14 20:52:33 What fascinates me about this is the degree to which KSA is hoping that nobody notices the quandary they're in. They pumped more to lower oil prices to the point where U.S. producers couldn't compete, and if oil prices shoot back up, well ... here's your competition.
5058 2018-10-14 20:52:31 Not to mention it was a dividend based on oil and fluctuated based on oil prices. Sometimes about 180 a month, sometimes under 100 bucks. Yeah thats true livin boy, i tell ya!
5059 2018-10-14 20:52:29 democrats do not understand that we can not have open borders,some Muslims are terrorist,criminals do not obey our gun laws and obtain their guns illegally. we need to provide our energy needs by oil,gas and coal till something else can take over.abortion is murder.
5060 2018-10-14 20:52:28 While at a Wawa, I saw a box of cookies that had an ingredient called interesterified soybean oil.

That’s very interestifering.
5061 2018-10-14 20:52:26 Y’all put oil in your rice?
For what!? 
5062 2018-10-14 20:52:24 I blame big oil
5063 2018-10-14 20:52:14 The numbers are inflated based on grandiose projections. Saudi Arabia can't withstand an attempt to use oil as leverage. They can't use different weaponry with their current platforms and structure. The relationship can be reduced significantly WITH stable energy markets.
5064 2018-10-14 20:52:13 Hey want you to know i loved your nude fantasy and oil wrestling videos with lethal bitches xo
5065 2018-10-14 20:52:00 Sorry, I can't tonight, I have to hike oil prices to $200 and start peace talks with iran if they’re sanctioned by us over khashoggi’s murder
5066 2018-10-14 20:51:59 3/3 covenant rights. We decree & declare by His stripes u r healed & r fearfully & wonderfully made.U have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb & by ur testimony - let it b released NOW!, in Jesus’ name. Amen 
p.s.: anoint yourself w/oil and pray this unto victory - it’s yours
5067 2018-10-14 20:51:42 Come on @SenSanders, the US is not going to give up oil and @realDonaldTrump is not giving up funding to shitty properties. Plus, the US is helping kill thousands in Yemen
5068 2018-10-14 20:51:41 It takes oil to transport and manufacture alternative energy... but oil and manu. can be done at home... but it's more expensive (hence outsourcing)... a complicated mess.
5069 2018-10-14 20:51:36 I always say follow the money. And the global currency is oil. Watch for sanctions or market changes that benefit Iran oil production while pushing back KoSA's control of OPEC. This is all staged for a reason.
5070 2018-10-14 20:51:34 Trust meee  it’s so annoying to deal with I just hope this other oil is a bit easier to deal with
5071 2018-10-14 20:51:17 Remember when the worst thing you could do as a non tech-savvy old person was delete emails on a unsecured server( like a lot of oil government employees do)? The good old days when our government wasn't blatantly in our face corrupt and trying to divide us.
5072 2018-10-14 20:51:15 . But I don’t really believe a live bug can survive the heat of hot oil so he probably planted them himself. Look how big that fly is 
5073 2018-10-14 20:51:08 Muted. You are endorsing snake oil and not contributing anything meaningful to this convo. We are talking concepts of safety, not "feel good" positivity. You are basically endorsing homeopathic medicine over preventative medicine.
5074 2018-10-14 20:51:06 What’s that thing called you use to measure the oil level in an engine?
5075 2018-10-14 20:51:01 Local Hero is from about 1980, so be prepared for it being dated, but it’s a beautiful film. Set in a Scottish seaside village about to be bought out by oil men. 

“Are you sure there’s two Ls in dollar, Gideon?”

“Aye. And there are two Gs in bugger off”
5076 2018-10-14 20:51:00 Oil train 9015 idling south of #MagnoliaBridge, north of downtown #Seattle, 1:50pm. #WAoiltrainwatch #oiltrains #StopOilTrains
5077 2018-10-14 20:50:37 My body wash has sativa hemp oil in it
5078 2018-10-14 20:50:32 Yes..Olive oil is actually very good for you! :D #Yum
5079 2018-10-14 20:50:31 Welll i guess it depends on the person. I cut my hair every month and use Argan oil, if u have a good hair stylist then your hair would grow faster in like 4 months. Also focus on the scalp and ends. Try using natural products.
5080 2018-10-14 20:50:29 A morning that was a full immersion into olive oil making #TerroirPuglia #weareinpuglia
5081 2018-10-14 20:50:07 Let's review, shall we? You made a false claim implying that I don't understand science or economics. I give you two peer reviewed articles and two reports showing that I do indeed understand science and economics around oil. You replied with a fact free ad hominem attack.
5082 2018-10-14 20:49:58 I would love to try #CBD oil, but I would risk my pain management to do so. That is breaking a new, unspoken law of sorts. Furthermore, a doctor finding traces of THC will vuew me suspiciously. FOREVER. Once you are red-flagged, it is hard to undo.
5083 2018-10-14 20:49:58 I need a oil change 
5084 2018-10-14 20:49:50 Food prices are directly effected by oil prices. If global oil prices are going to continue to rise because of political instability, what steps are you taking to increase your food security?
5085 2018-10-14 20:49:45 This isn't about Bitcoin specially, this is about being intellectually honest, could Bitcoin prove to be more like a public good like the Internet and emphatically not snake oil?
5086 2018-10-14 20:49:45 Once again Brett if u want to make a difference get together with educators and “civily” tell your client’s side of the oil debate - Would sure help if Your clients would admit that CO2 envisions is a problem and amelioration is a priority
5087 2018-10-14 20:49:21 Stop this oil madness it's antiquated and killing us
5088 2018-10-14 20:49:16 The rate at which @APCNigeria is digging up @atiku 's past. Very soon, they will discover crude oil.  @OfficialPDPNig
5089 2018-10-14 20:49:16 Koch Heads.  They lied for Bush 43 and that was also Oil
5090 2018-10-14 20:49:16 Saudi Arabia is 'israel's' oil supplier. so I don't think much will come of this. also they refine 'israel's' oil into gasoline (as 'israel' does not have oil refineries). I'm sure Jared Kushner is advising Pres. Trump to back off right now!
5091 2018-10-14 20:49:08 [拡散希望]調味料&食材botさん繋がりましょう。みんなを揚げたり絡めたり、ギトギトにしてあげます。
5092 2018-10-14 20:49:01 Went to the Farmers Market in Coral Springs and found some great food finds. Some soups that are homemade that you just have to add water to,some homemade salad dressings and done imported olive oil.  Anyone ever taste the Chinease Liche In The pic on the right?
5093 2018-10-14 20:48:53 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
5094 2018-10-14 20:48:46 Katie is rock solid when it comes to preserving high quality education, social security, Medicare, and access to health insurance, especially for struggling Americans, veterans, women, and pre-existing conditions. She is conservative by protecting our coastline from oil rigs.
5095 2018-10-14 20:48:29 But what are essential oils? Cooking oil?
5096 2018-10-14 20:48:07 Nevertheless, whatever your intent, it comes across as implying people having a pop at the org are mentally ill. Not so much pouring oil on troubled waters as petrol on the flames.
5097 2018-10-14 20:48:03 Yes ma, tell bro dayo to bring the anointing oil too
5098 2018-10-14 20:48:02 So much oil...
5099 2018-10-14 20:47:45 So sorry, auto correct and that is the point you bring up? Grow up yourself people would take your cause much more serious if you gave up all oil and products from oil or protest big polluters/other projects!
5100 2018-10-14 20:47:36 LOOKS LIKE THE DEMS NEED ANOTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZER SNAKE OIL SALES PERSON!!! BRING HIM OR HER ON CNN, MSNBC, NYTIMES, WAPO AND ALL OF THE REST OF YOU PROPAGANDA MEDIA OUTLETS FOR THE CORRUPT DNC/DEMOCRAT PARTY & MOST DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS! LOOKS BLEAK! HANDS BIDEN, REALLY???
5101 2018-10-14 20:47:18 Should probs pick up stripping just in time for the oil show
5102 2018-10-14 20:47:04 Thank you I really appreciate that comment I don't understand these people who keep insisting that CBD oil is not a product made from marijuana because it is and very often Trace Amounts of THC or found in it and they will accumulate over time
5103 2018-10-14 20:46:48 Dak used baby oil today?
5104 2018-10-14 20:46:41 branzino. . .19
daily arugula truffle oil. . .6
apple steak. . .21
house-cut squash broth. . .25
5105 2018-10-14 20:46:28 Put oil in my truck. Spilled some, and now I can smell it burning off. At least I hope that's what it is.
5106 2018-10-14 20:46:08 I have no products for sale

No advertisements on my website

I don't push any supplements or other shit that can make me quick $$$

And I don't try to sell courses

Remember that the next time someone talks shit about me

Good chance they sell oil, a supplement or some other BS.
5107 2018-10-14 20:45:54 You, an oil painter?
5108 2018-10-14 20:45:51 I really have never seen how people can detangle their hair with only oil.
5109 2018-10-14 20:45:38 90% of our revenues as a country comes from one commodity (oil), a commodity that is currently propped up and is bound to collapse in the nearest future.

We produce very little and consume too much and to top it up, what we do all day is to argue about politics and sex.
5110 2018-10-14 20:45:36 Like kinda roasted with some coconut oil and mozzarella
5111 2018-10-14 20:45:35 Hard to see where their mutual interests overlap as they’re competitors for the oil market and Putin is Tehran’s benefactor. But yeah, Syria Civil War 2.0 on the Arabian Peninsula is going to be lit.
5112 2018-10-14 20:45:20 @ChrisMasterjohn what's your opinion on canned cod liver? It's widely available in parts of Europe and cheap too. It's canned in its own oil, and can be just salted or smoked. Both taste good. Can it replace fermented CLO (expensive and harder to get)?
5113 2018-10-14 20:45:14 CNN GPS w/ @FareedZakaria convened an “expert” panel to discuss Saudi Arabia today and did not mention the work #oil once.
5114 2018-10-14 20:44:57 Yes third version.. Zim girls only need cooking oil no more money or chicken inn
5115 2018-10-14 20:44:57 I thought it meant I’m just not doing the next fad food thing my friend is doing.  I’m really not into coconut oil.
5116 2018-10-14 20:44:56 He is the master of darts. The machine needs a little oil
5117 2018-10-14 20:44:53 MMA isn't inclusive enough, oil wrestling on the other hand...
5118 2018-10-14 20:44:52 You have CBD oil?  I hate living in Floriduh.  I'm just kidding; if you behaved, you wouldn't be you.  And I like you just the way you are.  Don't change a thing.
5119 2018-10-14 20:44:49 By attacking one another. Taking pride in being assholes or talking over others. Dictating. Palm oil can be sustainable but obviously hopefully we can find something better or what have you. But if we want people to lessen their meat intake also those dairy intake we can't give +
5120 2018-10-14 20:44:47 @WFOJoe great job from Z Max on the Lucas Oil winners interviews, one of my favorite parts of the race! Thanks Joe, Lucas Oil and NHRA
5121 2018-10-14 20:44:39 On the other hand, if Saudi Arabia trades its oil only in Yuan, America is finished. And there’s the rub.  #thegreatunsaid
5122 2018-10-14 20:44:36 These enquiries have been done before by others. Result: sorry Capitalism is the best answer.  No skullduggery found by oil companies. But lets ignore the Socialist 90 cents per litre redistribution on fuel. If it was for roads why does it cost me the same to fill up my lawnmower
5123 2018-10-14 20:44:34 Google search, it's on oil website. 
We printed out a copy because it "comes and goes"
5124 2018-10-14 20:44:30 Most soybeans are processed for oil & protein for the animal feed industry. A small percentage is processed for human consumption & made into products: soy milk, soy flour, soy protein, tofu & other retail food products. They are also used in many non-food (industrial) products.
5125 2018-10-14 20:44:24 @ProfOsinbajo Daddy Calvary greetings .please intervene ,I started the security structure sterling oil and gas are enjoying now 2010
5126 2018-10-14 20:44:21 Oh my bad  yeah give that a try! It’s meant to be a little bit more diluted than castor oil
5127 2018-10-14 20:44:21 Maple syrup, olive oil.
5128 2018-10-14 20:44:20 use black castor oil!
5129 2018-10-14 20:44:06 How do you miss out the global fall in oil price which affects the fx of many oil-producing nations? Is it Buhari that reduce global oil price? 
From $100 to $30 and you still expected the already weak naira to remain the same? Haha haba!
5130 2018-10-14 20:44:02 Certainly. The environmental consequence and potential infringements from changing the direction that oil is travelling down an existing pipe are likely not large.
5131 2018-10-14 20:44:01 Lol! They've got the oil. 
This is like a junkie saying his dealer needs him more than he needs the dealer.
5132 2018-10-14 20:43:45 Use beard oil sir.
And you never texted me .
5133 2018-10-14 20:43:40 Really. The original Keystone, Alberta Clipper, KM Anchor loop and Line 3 were all approved and built and are operational. I Northern words flowing oil.
5134 2018-10-14 20:43:36 "Interesting. I've heard Greeks love their olive oil. 

For some reason. "
5135 2018-10-14 20:43:35 Is that cause you need our oil
5136 2018-10-14 20:43:35 Oh fuck, I get another purity seal AND OLIVE OIL TO RUB ON MY ARMOUR?!
5137 2018-10-14 20:43:34 It's funded by UN. But you're right to query this. Research finds that as governments and business all send their own scientists to peer review the IPCC's climate scientists' work, it tends to underplay urgency - oil producing nations eg Saudi, Russia, US, make sure of this.
5138 2018-10-14 20:43:21 ??????!!! you have oil? and that makes you" wealthy man"? inappropriate comment
5139 2018-10-14 20:43:14 Expensive oil will just hasten global move to alternatives. Go ahead KSA cut your own throat.
5140 2018-10-14 20:43:04 Tried CBD oil yesterday and yea I’m about to get on that.
5141 2018-10-14 20:42:54 Why doesn't Trump invade and take their oil?
5142 2018-10-14 20:42:38 What is a cooking oil type of girl...wait, is that third category?
5143 2018-10-14 20:41:36 you cook with coconut oil, I use it for my hair. WE ARE NOT THE SAME
5144 2018-10-14 20:41:35 India is too far to send our oil there. Only your base would believe that stupid statement. #ScheerLies
5145 2018-10-14 20:41:28 We import more oil from Canada. Now that Trump has pissed off Canada will they be willing to raise production to help us? The right thing to do is section the hell out of Saudi Arabia but when has Trump done the right thing?
5146 2018-10-14 20:41:20 result of sanctioning Iran oil.
5147 2018-10-14 20:41:19 The cast-iron as symbol of healing and redemption. Wire brush, bit of oil, hot oven, job done.
5148 2018-10-14 20:41:18 N1102H
5149 2018-10-14 20:41:17 Scotland's oil revenue alone helped balance the books for decades. That's before we even mention water, gas, electricity and our other natural resources. We also pay more tax, per head, than any other part of the UK. Net recipients? We've literally kept your lights on!
5150 2018-10-14 20:40:51 What's the bet "it" pretends to cut back on Saudi oil we buy raise the price to almost what we get out of are sour crude we ship all over world ?
5151 2018-10-14 20:40:37 There’s an essential oil yoga class at 5:30 ... hmmmmm
5152 2018-10-14 20:40:30 That's what Trumpie wants, high prices to feed the stock prices that he holds with all the oil companies.  He is truly a male slut!
5153 2018-10-14 20:40:28 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
5154 2018-10-14 20:40:28 Em, that's not news. :)   Coal and oil, yes, because we've all the cheap stuff taken (the stuff that takes a barrel to produce 100) and are finding it dearer and dearer to get (ie when it takes a barrel to produce 10 or 5 or 2).  Also, clean water, clean air and living soil.
5155 2018-10-14 20:40:26 You mean like people who argue that US oil is "too environmentally unfriendly" to use when it's discovered they were wrong about its scarcity? Or like people who argue that Iran is totally abiding by JCPOA terms and the weapons it arms Houthis with are acceptable?
5156 2018-10-14 20:40:24 I've been eating veggie/veg since I was like 14. And even before that never ate beef and many other meats. Mainly just ate dairy and such. I've seen animal rights movement come along way. But it didn't get this way because last Tuesday Sally said some shit about palm oil. ++
5157 2018-10-14 20:40:20 Good, because no one should take bitcoin seriously. It's snake oil.
5158 2018-10-14 20:40:14 And Canadian oil and gas can help reduce China and India’s reliance on coal for energy. They’re seeking alternatives, while continuing to improve standards of living. Why can’t we be part of that?
5159 2018-10-14 20:40:09 That Need For Speed shit we pulled last night forcing me to get oil change dis week
5160 2018-10-14 20:40:09 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
5161 2018-10-14 20:40:03 Are you going to surprise us and put out a PR saying that your working in the Permian Basin?  People seem to think your next company you merge with might be in the oil industry?
5162 2018-10-14 20:39:52 trump mad - > saudi oh shit - > trump mad - > saudi : " more oil pump" - > oil crash - >  trump happy
5163 2018-10-14 20:39:45 We call them cooking oil girls as long I have cooking oil am safe
5164 2018-10-14 20:39:43 I will push for more vegetarianism, but not through shaming people or calling things poison. 

Coconut oil was recently called "pure poison". Spoiler: It's not.

5166 2018-10-14 20:39:32 Trump is a crap businessman if he doesn't see the US is the one with power here, not like KSA can get our level of quality anywhere else. We have our own oil surplus now, don't need them for anything.
5167 2018-10-14 20:39:21 PRAISE REPORT.......Had to get a couple of items at Costco today one of which being Olive Oil. I was dreading paying $32.00 for it HOWEVER when I got there the price had been lowered to $25.00.....PRAISE GOD!! Every dollar helps these days!!
5168 2018-10-14 20:39:14 Purple gloves, coconut oil, zucchini
5169 2018-10-14 20:39:12 Disappointed by customer service. Wrong delivery, shoddy service and then black oil left on drive, causing damage to terrace and house floor. #GOFoil
5170 2018-10-14 20:39:12 Lool ffs it’s Amla oil . Just googled it.... meant to be good apparently
5171 2018-10-14 20:39:05 You’re aware the oil and gas we export doesn’t contribute to Canadian emissions, right? Emissions are generated when it’s refined and used, at the destination.
5172 2018-10-14 20:39:00 Imagine we had a state in Nigeria with: 
-Plateau weather 
-Abuja road network 
-Lagos opportunities 
-Cross River’ tourism 
-Bayelsa oil 
... add yours
5173 2018-10-14 20:38:39 Put water on his head and face,or oil, it is an old trick.
5174 2018-10-14 20:38:30 Actual progression will not happen over night. Should we avoid palm oil? Probably. Yes. But to scream at people over it for hours  wishlist doing many other harmful things and supporting millions of other bs is foolish. ++
5175 2018-10-14 20:38:24 Or maybe we will take care about Venezuela. They have plenty of oil too and need help.
5176 2018-10-14 20:38:19 They sell us oil we sell them bombs, nothing will get in the way of that....

Oil lamps ftw
5178 2018-10-14 20:38:13 Watch the oil markets tomorrow. Tensions with Saudi Arabia could scare traders. It will be interesting to see the price that markets put on those risks. But the general consensus is that prices are going up next week.
5179 2018-10-14 20:38:04 Since president Nexon Saudi oil ( 10 million barrel made your dollar stand alone. Just imagine if China would buy it's 3 million barrel in yeah. Dear dragging people attention is easy but been reasonable & accurate is more important

5183 2018-10-14 20:37:27 This might AS WELL describe the brothels in America that are masquerading as lodging places open to the public (usually hotels):

"Men constantly came in and out, mostly...from the oil fields [which you can tell from the vehicles on the parking lot], but men from other businesses
5184 2018-10-14 20:37:26 Trump:  Time to take the Saudi oil.
5185 2018-10-14 20:37:22 Probably we will go and help your economy during recession but you will have to give us back your oil reserves.
5186 2018-10-14 20:37:15 The saudies are the ones imposing dude. What the fuck are you talking about? Who do you think I am that I have the power to inflict a 200 dollar price tag on oil?
5187 2018-10-14 20:37:14 Its acc so sad how expensive oil paint and canvas' are if it was cheaper i coulda been the next Van Gogh in my spare time
5188 2018-10-14 20:37:12 Three days of voting over a weekend (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) with a requirement to provide one of the three days off would cover everyone except extreme condition workers (oil fields, fishing boats). But requiring no reason absentee would cover them too.
5189 2018-10-14 20:37:07 The US exported a record 1.7 million barrels of oil per day in October 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's four times as much as in 2015, when federal law prohibited shipping oil to most places except Canada. We just stop exporting.
5190 2018-10-14 20:37:02 Saudi Arabia making themselves look worse. The only thing they have that would ‘threaten’ us I suppose would be the oil market lol.
5191 2018-10-14 20:36:55 Dealerships have the best oil.
5192 2018-10-14 20:36:55 The world heavily relies on the fair treatment of people based on speech and views.  This is a condemnable act and the world is transitioning from an oil based economy. This isn’t in SA ballpark by any means.
5193 2018-10-14 20:36:45 The US exported a record 1.7 million barrels of oil per day in October 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's four times as much as in 2015, when federal law prohibited shipping oil to most places except Canada. We just stop exporting.
5194 2018-10-14 20:36:42 There seems to be quite a bit of oil related clothing in the picture.
5195 2018-10-14 20:36:31 We've had 26 "500 year storms" in the past 25 years but -according to the republicans, there is no such thing as climate change & we need more COAL and MORE OIL and who cares if it burns clean?  WHO CARES?  We need more black smoke blowing stacks on diesel trucks STAT!
5196 2018-10-14 20:36:21 I can understand the good intentions of the liberals unfortunately oil and gas is here for awhile until we can come up with a lot better options so in the meantime stop punishing people trying to make a living
5197 2018-10-14 20:36:16 Selling snake oil.
5198 2018-10-14 20:36:04 As many others already mentioned before me. If one is to avoid palm oil literally get ready to avoid a thousand of other things. It else your beliefs don't mean too much at the end of the day. WE DO NOT LIVE IN A VEGAN WORLD. Much less one who considers animal rights. ++
5199 2018-10-14 20:35:55 When did American start caring about Saudi journalist.. oh wait the oil prices.. I get it now.. #SaudiArabia #MBSKillsKhashoggi #Khashoggi
5200 2018-10-14 20:35:54 The world is now complete. My 2nd mama finally joined Twitter. Everyone welcome LG Jordan Oil’s Finest, @amyjdean70 ! #Family
5201 2018-10-14 20:35:51 I know but I’ve been told some amala oil is meant to be as good 
5202 2018-10-14 20:35:50 Yasir and Olubukola, you both are too hilarious.  The dude is a clown!
5203 2018-10-14 20:35:42 You are absolutely correct. dumb donald only cares about money. He's made alot of money from them in trump towers. We're getting oil instead of cash anyway. I think.
5204 2018-10-14 20:35:36 I tell people my vocabulary expanded when I was in the military and it was polished when I worked in the oil fields. #VeteransAgainstTrump
5205 2018-10-14 20:35:35 Big Oil's GOP Congressional sycophants and Trump say it's all a hoax. "Nothing to see there, folks."
5206 2018-10-14 20:35:33 Reducing dependence on oil is a must ! This will give humanity a breath of fresh air .hiw many millions died because of oil ?
5207 2018-10-14 20:35:32 Climate change fueled by carbon intensive tar sands and the pipelines that move the oil to markets? Like the #Transmountain pipeline your government bought with my taxpayer dollars? The twinning project that will help the tar sands expand? Hypocritical!
5208 2018-10-14 20:35:32 i need a light everyday oil for my hair
5209 2018-10-14 20:35:16 Oil price 80 $ x1000000= we are very $$$$$€€€﷼﷼
R U sure usa not need us
5210 2018-10-14 20:35:11 Was d crude stolen from abroad? Or the international community are to come to police our crude oil facility in Nigeria? Jesus, y now.
5211 2018-10-14 20:35:00 Ie what i mean, the eastern fron was Germans own doing, rather than proactive honourable intervention from Russia.  Theres also an appreciation that the Germans had no choice but invade russia for the oil, rather than it being a folly that some folks like to compare to Napoleon.
5212 2018-10-14 20:34:57 Why do people need to donate? Your gov has plenty of money. In the pockets of the politicians. Start with the climate deniers. They've got YUGE pockets thanks to oil and coal lobbyists
5213 2018-10-14 20:34:52 Serious question Tzeporah, why do you believe that oil demand being met by counties who are not signatories to #parisaccord is better for the world? Why is it better to ship oil using VLCC's that are linked to millions of deaths globally? #climatechangeisglobal #transparency
5214 2018-10-14 20:34:52 Lena added in the sesame oil and stirred it. "More than That? Please do tell me." Lena added in the salt stirring it once again. Then the sugar. "I'm not a horrible cook. Not the best. Always room for improvement I believe. " she added in the garlic and stirred it. Then the soy -
5215 2018-10-14 20:34:41 I just ate that food with all@that oil now I have a damn a headache  #NeverAgain this is why I don’t eat #FASTFOOD!
5216 2018-10-14 20:34:40 We catch the fish in our territorial waters they catch their fish in theirs. It is our resource, just the same as oil or gas. After Brexit they should have no right to fish our waters. It will be good for Britain and our fishing industry.
5217 2018-10-14 20:34:40 Oh and anti-digitalism is not an actual ideology within art circles, only an utsu-P Vocaloid song (a badass one at that). But I'd expect there was quite a lot of pushback the moment graphic tablets appeared on the market from the traditional oil and canvas types.
5218 2018-10-14 20:34:38 The oil is also sold/shipped to Eritrea as a contraband. Currency exchange could be the answer for now while they're refining what the governing policy would be.
5219 2018-10-14 20:34:37 We bought some emergency Whole Earth on holiday (ah, the palm oil!) and they refused to eat it
5220 2018-10-14 20:34:25 True. However, the most ethical and environmentally friendly oil comes from right here in Canada. 

If we have enough here, and its the best on earth, why not use our own supply?
5221 2018-10-14 20:34:19 The worst type of oil, unfortunately. Tar sands (oil sands) are the most inefficient type of oil to extract, and produces the most carbon in it's lifecycle. Renewable energy solutions only, please.
5222 2018-10-14 20:34:10 @DomMcLennon you want a thc oil filled juul pod tuesday?
5223 2018-10-14 20:33:55 In your daily market cycle briefing report the gold and the silver platinum oil has not changed significantly since the 15 of August
5224 2018-10-14 20:33:54 How many health benefits have come from technology that was driven by energy provided by oil and gas?
5225 2018-10-14 20:33:31 Famous oil painting?
5226 2018-10-14 20:33:20 The West has been selling out to Saudi for decades. Oil for weapons.  Pretty shameful for Canadians...
5227 2018-10-14 20:33:17 I struggled for months, nothing the GP prescribed worked, awake at 3am every night and not managing to go back to sleep. This was a catalyst for anxiety , my fab reflexologist suggested magnesium oil spray. Wow, it worked from day 1. The answer or mind over matter? #grief
5228 2018-10-14 20:33:09 Unfortunately people seem to forget and have a short memory. JC type of policies never worked long term, that's why New Labour was created. Look what happened to Venezuela, people cannot afford to buy toilet paper and you really cannot blame it on crash oil prices only
5229 2018-10-14 20:33:00 My car tells me when it needs an oil change and won't shut up about it so this suits my tendency to not notice my mileage. Well done, car.
5230 2018-10-14 20:32:52 Try going back Thatcher and the destruction of the North, she dumped manufacturing and used oil revenues to pay dole, closed tech colleges. Whereas Germany invested in its engineering base. Now the Tories want a global Britain: it's a sick  joke
5231 2018-10-14 20:32:52 Agree completely. I eat more healthily than most but I loathe olives and the musty taste of olive oil so, of course, I have something else instead.
5232 2018-10-14 20:32:46 Good. They threatened to tank the global oil prices.
5233 2018-10-14 20:32:40 You must include @Tesla Battery storage  to fend off Big Oil
5234 2018-10-14 20:32:36 @sainsburys so glad to see that your Wholenut Milk Chocolate is palm oil free and @FAIRTRADE , it's getting harder to find palm oil free products these days.
5235 2018-10-14 20:32:28 In evangelical churches, yes. It's based on when the Apostles commissioned a new apostle. They would lay hands on him, anoint him with oil and declare him an apostle.
5236 2018-10-14 20:32:24 Aside from the Oil for Security paradigm which looks more favourably for Western (principally U.S) powers - do you not think KSA could threaten U.S of reorientating their foreign policy (more towards adversaries Iran/Russia/China) as a form of leverage?
5237 2018-10-14 20:32:16 Might help if our choices weren’t “ultra rich career politician owned by gun lobby” vs “ultra rich career politician owned by the oil lobby”
5238 2018-10-14 20:32:10 OK, in my defense I’m not getting any younger & I blame the CBD oil! 
5239 2018-10-14 20:32:07 How far is the ride to Lucas Oil?
5240 2018-10-14 20:32:03 I HV a feeling that he wl surely resign in a few days; this is just diversion tactics of BJP to get some relief from rafale and oil price debates! 
5241 2018-10-14 20:31:49 Serious question: where can I get CBD oil?
5242 2018-10-14 20:31:35 Any recommendations on an oil free moisturizer??
5243 2018-10-14 20:31:20 Lol you can relate na.
5244 2018-10-14 20:31:17 I wnana put suncreen or oil on his baxk or whatever it is in the heles one
5245 2018-10-14 20:31:09 Florida Amendment 9: "Designed to Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling and Ban Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces."

5247 2018-10-14 20:30:51 Actually, #US dollar used to depend on Saudi oil, but was taken off of Saudi oil, as a backing, several decades ago. The #FederalReserve no longer uses any form of backing for US supposed currency.
5248 2018-10-14 20:30:42 that way when the oil runs out we will no longer need to heat are homes. it will all work out.

Today I decided it was time to expand my chef skills (microwaving cup-of-noodles) to cook a steak... 
so as I'm cooking, I'm on FT w/ my mom, I have my phone in one hand and seasoning in the other, the steak was burning, & I dropped my phone in the pan with hot oil :)

5255 2018-10-14 20:30:13 Amala oil is meant to be as good but not as heavy
5256 2018-10-14 20:30:11 It's good also for USA, but i suggest after the midterms election Oil jumps upper than $100. The more Oil goes up the more demands will be on USD and that's a catastrophe for China because they but not like USA they produce.

5263 2018-10-14 20:29:23 Lol. Sounds like a Calabar name
5264 2018-10-14 20:29:17 That's the same case for any team or club ever.  You're thick.  There's no point in pointing out "oil money" if it doesn't matter where it came from... Your words.
5265 2018-10-14 20:29:17 Oil for the engine;-)
5266 2018-10-14 20:29:09 Could you please provide a detailed explanation as to how exactly this oil is “ethical “?

5270 2018-10-14 20:29:02 Arab oil embargo 1973. Tensions with KSA 2018.
5271 2018-10-14 20:29:00 Imports from Saudi Arabia accounted for 9% of total US imports and provide 4.8% of total US oil consumption.   Overall, Saudi Arabia accounts for 13% of world oil production (2017).
5272 2018-10-14 20:28:53 Yes, it’s pretty strong. Coconut is best saved for savoury dishes in my opinion, and should be used sparingly. Quite like frying in coconut oil though.
5273 2018-10-14 20:28:38 I’m sure you’re aware that oil companies are subsidized but pay far more in overall taxes and revenues back to government than governments put into them. It’s not like government subsidizes them in the traditional way that word is normally used...
5274 2018-10-14 20:28:29 Any long form content describing history of Saudi oil production/exploration?

5277 2018-10-14 20:28:18 There is no outcome that doesn't involve suffering. You are making a false dichotomy. If we accept the nasty oil price and use it, we make lemonade of a bad situation. Bitching about the lemon does nothing to solve the problems ahead of us.
5278 2018-10-14 20:28:15 Gonna train that dragon/ Gonna train it fine/ Gotta use oil based paint/ Cos the wood is piiiiiiiine  - wait...
5279 2018-10-14 20:28:13 Ah, the old oil lower equals stimulus argument. Never ever seen that proven in the data. Usually these things fall for macro reasons, not in a vacuum, they are indicators of demand erosion when observed across numerous commodities.
5280 2018-10-14 20:28:07 Sam, that is a mealy bug Neem oil will kill them
5281 2018-10-14 20:28:05 If Saudi withholds oil from us it would have negligible economic impact. Fracking of oil takes care of that. And who does Saudi turn to for support in other areas? France? Germany? ... No one.
5282 2018-10-14 20:27:55 Most of the homes w/paid off mortgages no longer had insurance coverage , I know because I saw hundreds of the BP OIL CLAIMS that  were processed for billions of dollars in damages 12 years ago,& many of the beach houses were built with the multi billion $ settlement.

5301 2018-10-14 20:25:45 It is in an interesting question whether we’d be better off dealing with Iran as the de facto regional hegemon rather than dean with Riyadh’s bullshit for one more day. 

Plus those oil wells are pushing up an awful lot of seawater these days...

5311 2018-10-14 20:24:49 It's about far more than oil. It's losing the mass recycling of Fx into Treasuries and sparking inflation & higher yields. I think if managed properly, it could be a net positive long-term for US manufacturing and working class, but bad for the coasts and asset markets near term

5317 2018-10-14 20:24:09 Thursday NPR quizzed proponents of a “carbon tax“. Question: who pays the tax, car manufacturers,oil companies? Answer: NO, drivers-AND part of the money will be sent to “low income“ Americans in the form of a monthly “stipend”.Just another $ giveaway to half of US to buy votes
5318 2018-10-14 20:24:04 Not even Turkey's growing patronage of Iran oil supply?
5319 2018-10-14 20:23:35 I don’t know why the Jamie Oliver tic of asking for a “glug” of olive oil in his recipes sets my teeth on edge, but boy does it ever.

How bioavailable is it in most humans, will a human metabolise the full O3 in Algae oil like a fish can? Are there any drawbacks to It: bad bacteria in algae farm lakes?
5323 2018-10-14 20:23:16 All I can say here is that high oil prices put a big squeeze on the little guys and crashed the subprime markets in '08, cascading throughout the markets as a whole. I can only hope there is not a repeat of that. Maybe nothing will happen and the $200/bbl talk is just bluster.
5324 2018-10-14 20:23:05 Nobody gave me any advice o,they just cabashed on my head and gave me anointing oil to drink

5327 2018-10-14 20:22:50 If Saudi Arabia could raise the price of oil to $200, they would have done it already. Plenty of other producers happy to increase production well short of that price.
5328 2018-10-14 20:22:48 It would be far less unethical to import oil from #Venezuela & #Iran than from the murderous #Saudi regime. The #Venezuelan & #Iranian governments should be making this point loudly & getting the public to pressure the UK government! I don't want #SaudiArabia's #BloodyOil!
5329 2018-10-14 20:22:47 I can’t wait until the oil runs out and you monsters are back to living in ratty tents.
5330 2018-10-14 20:22:34 That Saudis are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And that they are smarter than the oil majors in US in hedging their business as humanity moves away from the age of oil. If I were Exxon, I would invest in EVs too.

5333 2018-10-14 20:22:13 Most interesting of all is the gold-backed yuan China introduced to buy oil. The fact that the US is not going ballistic over that is VERY telling. The Petrodollar has been the backbone of US strength for 50 years. 

We can only conclude the US consents to this. 

Think of that!!

5340 2018-10-14 20:21:26 All oils work if they are real. Many oils are fake. The only way to ensure yours is real is to make it from scratch or get it tested. If you eat 60 to 200 grams of cannabis oil (depending on how bad your health is) over 3 months, your cancer will be cured! This protocol works100%
5341 2018-10-14 20:21:23 Just look at the pollution from oil. The USA pumps an enormous amount of Co2 into the atmosphere and Trump doesn’t give a damn. People make the change so vote for change.
5342 2018-10-14 20:21:22 i bought this 'fireside' fragrance oil and it definitely smells musky and smokey but I'm not sure what to do with it. I don't think it would smell strongly enough in a candle, and would anyone even want tarts with this scent?

5344 2018-10-14 20:21:11 So #KSA, what you're saying here is that you don't have a plausible or transparent story for what happened in #Turkey (or you'd have told us)

I suppose that also means your excuses for killing women, children, & men in #Yemen aren't worth so much as a drop of your #oil

5347 2018-10-14 20:20:52 If Ted Cruz tweeted what he was going to do for Texas, it would be to continue only showing up to work half the time & continue taking money from big oil so he works for billionaires instead of the people.

5350 2018-10-14 20:20:04 How exactly do we accomplish diversification by building more oil infrastructure? Growth sure, but diversification seems a stretch.
5351 2018-10-14 20:20:00 And we buy lots of oil from them.
5352 2018-10-14 20:19:57 Are you trying to talk about oil and gas imports? Really?
5353 2018-10-14 20:19:48 Went to the gym this morning, got groceries, cleaned Cody’s car, and got an oil change! 
Very successful day!
5354 2018-10-14 20:19:48 Supply and demand does have an impact, but not SA as much as world trade influence the dollar per barrel of crued oil and only SA. Our high fuel price is due to the R17 per litre consisting out of 40% taxes..

5356 2018-10-14 20:19:37 Saudi Arabia better apologize to the world before there’s a world wide boycott of Saudi oil. Hopefully it’s not already too late.
5357 2018-10-14 20:19:22 Frank Gore looks like a fucking oil slick.
5358 2018-10-14 20:19:17 Yet Saudi Arabia, the country that has bombed Yemen into the stoneage with western supplied weapons is rewarded with more weapons and oil sales. Even the fake "humanitarian" Canadian government sells it weapons and buys huge amounts of its oil while blocking Canadian oil. Sheesh.
5359 2018-10-14 20:19:10 WE should have re-thought the alliance a long time ago - instead of blindly following this mob into their oil wars.  Our standing in the world is less because of our closeness to everything USA.
5360 2018-10-14 20:19:03 Saudi Arabia is a criminal state. It relies on oil for power and religion for control. Saudi Arabia despises the media. Don't be like Saudi Arabia.

5365 2018-10-14 20:18:21 You know, even repeating a misleading phrase like "ethical oil" is about as unethical as you can get. #conservatwats

5367 2018-10-14 20:18:00 Andreas : Why do you hate Tesla so vehemently ..Is it EVs , the business case , Elon , or all 3?.
The truth is that big oil is politically corrupt and creating huge environmental problems and political imbalances - do you agree ?
What is your solution ?
5368 2018-10-14 20:17:58 I hereby declare Lucas Oil Stadium to be renamed "Loser Oil Stadium"

This team is trash, and not even recyclable.

5370 2018-10-14 20:17:46 Stop putting coconut oil in everything 
5371 2018-10-14 20:17:39 Anyone remember the 1973 oil embargo? History may soon repeat itself.
5372 2018-10-14 20:17:35 Making chips is fun... ... How do you get oil to stop going everywhere?
5373 2018-10-14 20:17:21 We have what they need.  We're the top oil producer now.  So F them.  The issue is the corrupt Trumps and Jared who's selling them intel.
5374 2018-10-14 20:17:18 They don’t. But they need to control oil in North America. We threaten that because our reserves are greater than the Saudi’s. Old constant. Oil=money & money=power.
5375 2018-10-14 20:17:17 Nobody understands my love for sesame oil
5376 2018-10-14 20:17:08 The feminine groupthink never interested me because it was  dishonest & useless on many levels. The leaders promoting these lies were financially profiting & very political. Time has proven their selling snake oil.
5377 2018-10-14 20:17:07 Anyone going to their little conference ONLY emboldens them. We need to choke them economically. Let them drown in all the oil they won't be able to to sell. They need us for their future economic  diversity and health.
5378 2018-10-14 20:17:04 They don't sell oil to the US, either.  If that's the standard, they should fly Mirages.
5379 2018-10-14 20:16:58 It was one of my best decisions to buy an air fryer. Cooks fried foods fast without oil, it’s quiet and it doesn’t smell up a place.
5380 2018-10-14 20:16:55 Honey, lemon and ginger. Vix or olbus oil bowl and have a steam session with a towel over your head, I like to play the game of how long you can stay under before your eyes bleed! (It makes things interesting)
5381 2018-10-14 20:16:54 This ostentatious conspicuous consumption will obviously not last, then what, will Jesus replenish his coffers, or did we miss the part where he owns an oil field?
5382 2018-10-14 20:16:52 know the major offence pmb committed
1. He refused to dance to their tune as he did not share our money to the csbals and also not renew their oil well license
5383 2018-10-14 20:16:49 I think you can mix it with coconut oil and peppermint oil to make it taste better.
5384 2018-10-14 20:16:37 In body products, very much so. Natural coconut oil is fine, if you must.
5385 2018-10-14 20:16:29 And take CBS oil
5386 2018-10-14 20:16:29 It’s the Lord’s day, so I used Holy Oil as lube.
5387 2018-10-14 20:16:25 Jimmy wanted us to get rid of our over dependence on foreign oil.

5388 2018-10-14 20:16:05 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
5389 2018-10-14 20:16:03 Time to pay the price.  The guy went in and hasn’t gone out.  They probably cut his body into pieces and disposed of it and the US after 9/11 has been waiting to hit you guys and you just handed the US reason to burn your oil.  The arrogant Saudi Prince is going down.
5390 2018-10-14 20:16:02 @SaversHB do u intend 2 stock 'by my beard' shampoo, conditioner & oil? noticed the oil in one of stores just wondered if the whole range will b available?

5392 2018-10-14 20:15:57 You make the classic campaigners mistake. You call for $200 oil & the carnage that would entail & because I call you out on it you assume I am the enemy rather than $200 oil is just a shit idea that won’t get what you want.
5393 2018-10-14 20:15:53 now taeyong got a whole ass mullet and if they don’t make sure that shit taken care of ima personally send some castor oil to sm for him
5394 2018-10-14 20:15:53 Add three days but not stop mixing with oil into it.
5395 2018-10-14 20:15:52 @bandit4470 
It was more clearly so when poppies were not expensive artsy trinkets, before recent wars for oil etc
5396 2018-10-14 20:15:47 Retail therapy and got Ginger an oil change..  I am going to take this nap until 7p 
5397 2018-10-14 20:15:46 And there are plenty of oil companies who support teacher conferences.
5398 2018-10-14 20:15:42 My 5 branches of law are Sport law, criminal law ,oil law, maritime law,Aviation law.
5399 2018-10-14 20:15:39 So true Mr Sohi. Is 1% era are getting richer than ever shipping this $18 oil to gulf coast then selling it back to eastern Canada at $80. You have to love Sunnyways
5400 2018-10-14 20:15:38 Not that the POTUS is an infinite wellspring of wisdom, but worth noting that when the Saudis threaten $200 per barrel oil it would collapse our economy.  Just look at 2008 when oil reached $150 per barrel.
5401 2018-10-14 20:15:34 #4 Avocado + Egg + Olive Oil Hair Mask : 

- Blend the Avocado 

- Add 1 Egg 

- Add 2 tb of Olive Oil  

- apply it to your hair for 30 min, then wash it off 
5402 2018-10-14 20:15:28 Because Big Oil told @JustinTrudeau and @cathmckenna to do it. They're good lap dogs...they do what they're told. They'll get a bone tossed their way come election time if they pull it off. Climate criminals!
5403 2018-10-14 20:15:11 The Saudis are not the mob. They are not going to whack a guy the way we do in Brooklyn. They are not that stupid. This is a step up, to breakup the USA/KSA oil cartel, the strategic regional alliance and a $110B arms deal. No way MBS risks all that for one slimy Wapo reporter.
5404 2018-10-14 20:15:09 I suspect that's a big part of the story, absolutely (and further evidenced by the type of job losses in oil and gas; and the concentration of losses among lower-education males).
5405 2018-10-14 20:15:02 The microwave method does NOTHING except heat up the water.  Just use warm water if you choose. But soap and water is all you need. @DrBronner is the best soap for this. If you let it sit for a while before cleaning, use an oil first maybe.
5406 2018-10-14 20:15:02 Dylan,

You missed the fact that trump hates Canada.

Canada.

WTF did we do other than provide oil, gas, steel, food and military support?

We also have a young handsome intelligent and widely respected leader who...

Oh.  I get it.
5407 2018-10-14 20:15:00 People need to step up and deny that the allegations are “baseless” because apparently there is plenty of evidence. US does not need Saudi blood money or oil. Too bad for #Raytheon & #Lockheed. Good time to focus on #renewable energy.This is a matter for the #Hague to investigate
5408 2018-10-14 20:14:56 15 of 19 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia and Dubya attacked Iraq?

Numerous Oil Princes hated USA and funded 9/11 and they still hate USA today!

What's next?


5409 2018-10-14 20:14:53 Why do people like baby oil.... this stuff is so sticky and slippery at the same time. My OCD cannot handle this.
5410 2018-10-14 20:14:46 I'm skeptical of any punishment on Bin Salman, as this will affect oil price, military stocks and  investment from  ( Saudi Fund ). Trumps worries are purely business and strategic. That has always been American Policy!!

I hope they act on this though!!
5411 2018-10-14 20:14:34 Who gives a shit what Saudi's think ? Lots of other oil suppliers will be very happy to take American $$. If the Dotard doesn't sanction them, you should assume he's in their back pocket and if so, investigate him after November.  #VoteBlue #BlueWave #LockHimUp
5412 2018-10-14 20:14:29 Right a GLOBAL market. What happens to Saudi Arabia impacts the GLOBAL market. What happens to our economy (And every economy on the planet) when the GLOBAL market is impacted by the impact of Saudi oil?
5413 2018-10-14 20:14:25 “floats with oil”. We export 10m barrels a day. no one does the same. if we cut 4m, no one has that much spare capacity.
5414 2018-10-14 20:14:13 Saudi threat is toothless. They’d be overplaying their hand and they know it. It would simultaneously provide the economic justification for the rapid adoption of renewables worldwide, and end the reliance on saudi oil making them irrelevant. Either way they lose
5415 2018-10-14 20:14:02 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
5416 2018-10-14 20:13:53 As well as Milk,crude cooking oil,groundnuts,soya beans,tinned meats,tinned fish,tinned beans,etc etc the list endless
5417 2018-10-14 20:13:49 パナシェを思い出しつつゼニガメで！
5418 2018-10-14 20:13:43 Shaving my legs then putting baby oil on them 
5419 2018-10-14 20:13:39 We will see without Saudi your country can’t alive 1 day if u don’t use force Just we destroy petro$ agreement. We will sell our oil by gold
5420 2018-10-14 20:13:15 Thats cos it was just a smell/scent.  Its the pure essential oil thats WONDERFUL.......
5421 2018-10-14 20:13:05 Basically they have the oil the world needs? Wait until electric cars are mainstream and oil is a swear word, even the great Roman Empire collapsed, eventually everything comes to an end
5422 2018-10-14 20:13:00 It makes no difference at all where it comes from. You don’t seem to be grasping this very well. The money is oil money, hence why I stated it as being so. If it had come from anywhere else, then I would’ve stayed so. It’s pretty simple really but you’re making hard work of it.
5423 2018-10-14 20:12:59 謎の野菜VSおれ
5424 2018-10-14 20:12:43 @CIA @FBI So the Saudis murder and decapitate a US reporter...say if anyone does anything to them they will put hardship on the world?...who the fuck do they think they are?...this stuff is blowing God's mind...I will persecute the Saudis over 9/11 and take every drop of oil...
5425 2018-10-14 20:12:37 Everyone is now fresh, all of use must gather use coconut oil.
5426 2018-10-14 20:12:33 I keep telling myself I’m gonna change my oil but I always forget
5427 2018-10-14 20:12:19 5/5 @Benardp2002 Maximum tenor is 36 months’ subject to years to retirement, 48 months for multinationals and 60 months for Oil majors.
Repayment amount must not exceed 33.33% of applicant's net monthly emolument.
5428 2018-10-14 20:12:17 @TurkiAldakhil one day the entire world, America first, will not need to rely on your oil. Ever heard of Tesla? Very soon nobody will care if you sell it for $400 a barrel.
5429 2018-10-14 20:12:14 Trevor, I often wonder if the young unemployment rate is high because so many quit high school to work in oil and gas and now they’re unemployed and without education?
5430 2018-10-14 20:12:13  baby oil should help
5431 2018-10-14 20:12:12 It’s coconut oil
5432 2018-10-14 20:12:09 Actually,  we don't need them for oil either. It's a bs talking point. We can produce enough oil here. But they manipulate the prices.
5433 2018-10-14 20:12:09 Again, evidence b-4 emotion. You may not feel kinship 2 them, but Israel's a white settler state that steals from natives just like in the Americas, Australia, etc. Objectively it's the same model.

Israel's a beachhead into the world's biggest oil region & heavily aided by We$t.
5434 2018-10-14 20:12:03 Now that the Saudis are threatening global economic security by manipulating oil prices in retaliatory measures against any sanctions for killing and torturing a journalist abroad, renewable energy should be viewed from a national security standpoint
5435 2018-10-14 20:11:54 #3 Olive oil + Banana mask : 

- 1 Banana Puree 
- 2 tb Olive Oil 

- apply it to your hair for 30 min, then wash it off 
5436 2018-10-14 20:11:48 Mr. Bush evacuated the Bin Laden family from the USn to SaudiA immediately after the 9/11 attacks.
It's about the oil. Always the oil.

5439 2018-10-14 20:11:06 US produces own oil, Canada is our largest supplier,and you only amount 8.3% of total imports 2)even if you pull all your investment, including the $110 billion arms deal, that’s not even 1% if the economy. Total arms sales make less than %1 anyway.  And please bring Putin to SA
5440 2018-10-14 20:10:52 The 1970s were when the problems with full employment became apparent made worse by oil shortages. 

The good news is that we'll have completely different, even worse failure modes.
5441 2018-10-14 20:10:51 It’s lovely to use. Just one coat. But the timber has to be free if all wax/oil. I actually used Tea to stain these, it brings out a grey in the grain. I then used a mid Oak water based stain & then the Osmo oil 
5442 2018-10-14 20:10:36 Interestingly enough, the Sanskrit word "Sneha" actually holds two meanings, that at first glance may seem completely unrelated, but to an Ayurvedic eye, holds so many connections. Its translation can be either “oil” and “love," literally confirming their mutual significance.
5443 2018-10-14 20:10:34 The U.S can produce enough oil. I think we should stop buying from you all together.  Let's see who REALLY needs whom.
5444 2018-10-14 20:10:29 world floats with oil. Once the slow-down kicks in Arabia will go deep into recession with very low oil prices...
5445 2018-10-14 20:10:23 Norway should leave the oil in the ground though. They have enough money and they're hurting the environment. The planet overheating would be bad for the other investments anyway
5446 2018-10-14 20:10:21 When the oil is warm, this ritual can directly and effectively counteract Vata's dry degenerating energy from ALL of our BODILY TISSUES- from our skin to the deepest layer of the body and everything in between.
5447 2018-10-14 20:10:16 Atay duha naman ka buwan wa tay change oil oy 
5448 2018-10-14 20:10:07 Lubricating. Heavy. Nourishing. This is what comes to mind when we think of the word "oil." In Ayurveda, the act of applying, or anointing the body with herbal oil is called Snehana.
5449 2018-10-14 20:10:05 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
5450 2018-10-14 20:10:03 Yes that oil industry group, @NEBCanada...
5451 2018-10-14 20:09:53 Hope all the hairs on oil executives scrotums turn 2 FISH HOOKS!
5452 2018-10-14 20:09:45 Not sure it happens at 5v5 with Licic and Yamamoto, not a good mix.
5453 2018-10-14 20:09:42 at this point any argument the GOP has over why climate change isn't real is just blatant lies to support big oil and agro companies that fund their golf courses
5454 2018-10-14 20:09:41 Sp why then is coal and oil subsidised to such a degree by the government, when those subsidies are distorting the true market flow towards renewables?
5455 2018-10-14 20:09:38 Hailey started the same way. Now she has plucked her whole chest. Vet thought it was hormonal, wrong! I apparently have a nervous bird. Now it’s a habit. We are trying several things. The coconut oil helped with dry skin
5456 2018-10-14 20:09:36 The administration is currently trying to devalue human life so that the businesses like Big Coal and Big Oil can pollute as much as they want and not have to consider how many of us will get sick or die from their pollution. Nice huh?
5457 2018-10-14 20:09:32 The world is funny , if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it’s government property.                                                     But if they find drugs , it’s yours.
5458 2018-10-14 20:09:10 So you think America can go without Saudi or Iran oil?  Without Saudi balance in middle east Iran would control area in no time. Anyone that thinks Saudi is not important to us is just in denial.
5459 2018-10-14 20:09:05 Tea tree oil works wonders. Just keep it covered after you apply it so your dogs can’t lick it off cause I’m pretty sure it’s not pet safe
5460 2018-10-14 20:09:04 The Saudis reallly are camel fuckers who scored some crude oil.. I guess letting their women drive needed some torture and murder to appear tough
5461 2018-10-14 20:09:03 Oil is not needed? Sure. When everyone drives electric cars, has electric houses, flies electric planes. Oh, and when you start making plastics without petrochemicals, lets talk then.
5462 2018-10-14 20:08:54 The era of petrodollars is likely to end with or without US policymakers in 2030s anyway. EU and China are switching rapidly away from oil. In US, power and storage from alternative energy are rapidly getting more competitive. But, what’s going to be the replacement for USD? :)
5463 2018-10-14 20:08:53 People stop buying Palm oil products x
5464 2018-10-14 20:08:52 Cooking oil $2,50
Cement  bag     $7
2kg sugar    $ 2 
Ndazopepuka ndisati ndaona rice 

5465 2018-10-14 20:08:43 Biotic/ Abiotic oil
5466 2018-10-14 20:08:43 Zelfs dan. Peak oil is een fabeltje. Gas en olie zijn er in overvloed.
5467 2018-10-14 20:08:37 Maybe they are selling the cooking oil then 
5468 2018-10-14 20:08:24 One of the greatest transformations in the culinary world has to be that of the humble carrot, which, when roasted in a coating of olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper, becomes a delicacy completely removed from its original form.
5469 2018-10-14 20:08:20 No, it wouldn’t hurt them if they would turn to Canada and make a deal to get more oil from Canada instead of Saudi Arabia.
5470 2018-10-14 20:08:10 @Nutradvance is the oil expert ♡
5471 2018-10-14 20:08:08 No actually we don’t need oil.  We’re about to become a net exporter.  Possibly an ally if they care to join the 21st century.  Facts are your friend sweetie.
5472 2018-10-14 20:07:57 Important to note that Saudi columnist Turki Dakheel, close to MBS, warning of higher oil prices and a Russian military base in Tabuk, Saudi if Trump Sanctions.

This is becoming a geopolitical fight in week 3, as US & Turkey get closer and Saudi looks East. Interesting to watch

5474 2018-10-14 20:07:40 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
5475 2018-10-14 20:07:08 Switch it in back.. If it persists there's oil shortage.. Or it's due for servicing
5476 2018-10-14 20:06:57 “It’s was built on a false premise” ... are we finally working out AI is programmed by humans? ... only taken 2 years of rubbish from “experts” trying to ‘snake oil” new products.

5478 2018-10-14 20:06:52 A whole russet potato, a tiny bowl to the side filled with vegetable oil and then some salt sprinkled into a curved line on one side of the plate?
5479 2018-10-14 20:06:48 “capitalism works”
yeah that’s why: 
- 99% of the world have as much wealth as 1%
- the planet is dying 
- oil war in the middle east 
but yeah, it works
5480 2018-10-14 20:06:47 Oil it up Philip
5481 2018-10-14 20:06:46 I put too much oil in my car and now it needs a mechanic
5482 2018-10-14 20:06:32 Oil on canvas - ororo lórí sneakers.
5483 2018-10-14 20:06:28 Way to stay in the race
5484 2018-10-14 20:06:26 use your brain. CNN/MSNBC are sponsored by bg oil/pharma, weapons contractors, Raytheon-MSNBC. MSNBC evening pundits made $30,000 a day in 2016. EP, Phil Griffin & Maddow rec'd multi millions by Clinton campaign for 100% pos. Clinton coverage, 24/7 Trump coverage, 0 Sanders cov'g
5485 2018-10-14 20:06:14 Indeed... he is a slick  snake oil salesman!
5486 2018-10-14 20:06:06 This hand holding with Saudi Arabia has been going on a long time. Trump won't do anything about it because he owes them tons.  If North America can self-sustain with oil and go with electric or hybrid vehicles and new ways to heat and generate electricity we should get rid of ME
5487 2018-10-14 20:05:50 15% off Jackson's oil paints and brushes isn't good for my bank account  (Bought a cadmium red and yellow anyway  the DPD guy loves me)
5488 2018-10-14 20:05:39 1. Saudi Arabia is a key cog in the USA containment of Iran M.E. strategy.

It also has oil, for which successive US administrations have been beholden to the House of Saudi.

There is the US1+billion arms deal that Trump signed
5489 2018-10-14 20:05:36 Intels, a logistics and facilities services provider in the maritime and oil and gas sectors, was co-founded by Gabriele Volpi, and former vice-president, Atiku Abubakar. Atiku has since sold most of his interest in the company to the former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu.
5490 2018-10-14 20:05:35 Wa State, when the oil co put out a beaytiful gull page add telling u how much u will suffer if you dont vote no, automatically vote yes. I-1631 is a YES VOTE .
5491 2018-10-14 20:05:27 Wow ... New economy I see with a negative GDP in Arabia you're going to see lots of troubles when the economy slows down and oil is not needed.
5492 2018-10-14 20:05:25 Wow ok, so they rattle the oil price sabre and buy tesla #smh
5493 2018-10-14 20:05:24 #Leeti or sweet soup(oil fried fluor+ sugar+ water), which is not very #BalancedDiet, is commonly served and very popular. If modified with more nutritious elements (cardamom, ginger, turmeric with some chopped almonds and walnuts), would help the #postpartum recovery properly.
5494 2018-10-14 20:05:19 Don’t blame Trump! Every President goes over & bows down to their King! It’s called oil!
5495 2018-10-14 20:05:13 You are not capable of drilling your own oil !! Cobbler’s children have no shoes
5496 2018-10-14 20:05:12 Eco-Terrorist? Geez, I wonder why the Supreme Court of Canada keeps turning down pipeline approvals and telling oil and gas “profit-terrorists” that they need to learn how to conduct meaningful consultation with people they disagree with? #ABLeg #CanPoli
5497 2018-10-14 20:05:10 Ewing Oil...

5499 2018-10-14 20:04:54 #1 Coconut/ Olive oil Treatment :

- Heat oil in a microwave
Safe bowl for 30 sec 

- Let it cool a bit 

- massage it in your scalp and apply it to your hair, then wash your hair well 
5500 2018-10-14 20:04:50 Oil from KRG?
5501 2018-10-14 20:04:46 Interesting to see that the Industrial Revolution in Britain gave rise to unmitigated pollution from burning coal and oil. Sadly the whole world copied us. What a mess.
5502 2018-10-14 20:04:46 The dollar is inextricably linked to the price of oil, I think the CIA would bump him off if he got too carried away
5503 2018-10-14 20:04:43 Meanwhile Saudi is implicitly basically threatening to cut oil supply if anyone does anything against them. ‘73 oil crisis redux, singlehanded. Esp w Iran out of the picture, supply-wise.
5504 2018-10-14 20:04:42 We don’t have time. We have to act now. Why will it take years to change to renewables?  Stranded assets in oil & gas? The last thing we need are even more #fracking wells. There comes a point when it has to stop #ClimateChange #IPCCReport
5505 2018-10-14 20:04:39 Yeah which is why I try to not shampoo often but even so, I have to wear it up bc it looks so awful and gross :/ right now I use Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo/conditioner. It’s been the only one so far that feels the least heavy & has worked the best so far but still not a fit
5506 2018-10-14 20:04:20 LIKE WHAT??? Eat their oil???
5507 2018-10-14 20:04:19 ali i am very interested in cbd oil but i know nothing about it can u please help me i think i would benefit from it
5508 2018-10-14 20:04:14 You need oil maybe? You need an ally in the Middle East area? You need their investment in your country? I can keep going but I think this is enough to trigger your thinking a bit
5509 2018-10-14 20:04:10 I have news for you; Fine Gael do not give a toss about the people, they only care about the gambling and speculating sector of society, that’s why we have a housing crisis. What non renewable resources do you mean coal and oil because we have several hundred years more of those?
5510 2018-10-14 20:04:05 If by room you mean vat of boiling oil then yes, room.
5511 2018-10-14 20:04:03 US can afford higher oil prices so lets kick middle east allies and China in the nuts. Our shale oil will revive, stronger oil would lead to stronger dollar, which would lead to Fed's affordability to change stance from hawkish to neutral. Lets make America great
5512 2018-10-14 20:04:02 I need to buy an oil infuser. 
5513 2018-10-14 20:03:56 I think Matt said it looks like oil or paint and it really does
5514 2018-10-14 20:03:41 Think;Saudis have $1 trillion investments in America, can raise oil price to $200 the barrel and switch to Russia,China,and approach Iran ..
5515 2018-10-14 20:03:38 I think I’d rather guzzle motor oil than see Peterman back on the field...
5516 2018-10-14 20:03:23 Just put my oil paintbrush into my G&T, that's how today's turned out. Furthermore, I proceeded to type this tweet in my search engine. Today's really not my day!
5517 2018-10-14 20:03:09 So @JeffFlake cast the deciding vote for a SCOTUS justice who’s sure to rule in favor of Big Oil.  Makes perfect sense. 
5518 2018-10-14 20:02:56 Oh before I forget, CBD oil helps some people with nightmare disorder, but I can't take it or I risk losing other meds/job opportunities so not sure personally.
5519 2018-10-14 20:02:36 I'm not pretending leadership. Just trying to pour some oil. 
Cool it means, well, cool it. Take a few moments out before letting some overpaid troll get you going.
5520 2018-10-14 20:02:35 Venezuela hooked their people on government freebies that were backed by oil. Democrats want to hook our people on freebies backed by    the success of others. Doing so erodes ambition because, what's the point... they're gonna take your shit.
5521 2018-10-14 20:02:12 Trump is only supported by 30% of US Citizens. He will be gone in two years. We don't need your oil. You are the one who needs USA for weapons and training. Get out of Yemen, take Trump with you and enjoy yourselves in the dessert.  The American people are tired of you.
5522 2018-10-14 20:02:05 All of which came to a halt when GOP and Reagan won in 1980 with his "Morning in America" theme and refocused on oil production. It only took the fossil fuel guys 2 years to take over the energy policy again. So Exxon knew and a lot of others knew but the money won out.
5523 2018-10-14 20:02:04 I’ve just moisturised my eyelashes with black seed oil and I think I might be partially blind after tonight
5524 2018-10-14 20:02:02 Abeg abeg....see what oil money has done for psg, man city and them. We get money but theres no problem with more 
5525 2018-10-14 20:01:55 Fish oil capsules
5526 2018-10-14 20:01:42 No we don’t. Tge new agreement is one sided. What is the threat? Who are you going to call for oil and water? Cannot wait.
5527 2018-10-14 20:01:35 Ara sona Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil
5528 2018-10-14 20:01:23 Yip follow the #money #coal #china #BC #bcpoli @jkenney @TonyclementCPC  - yet GOC wants to crash #Alberta #oil economy- it’s crazy
5529 2018-10-14 20:00:44 No im serious, these rich oil princes in the mid east and stuff literally hire jeniffer lopez, beyonce and etc for private performances and stuff for like 2M$$, its peak wealth disparity culture, so they def have the money too if they wanted too 
5530 2018-10-14 20:00:40 Dear Daughter,

It is Jollof Rice not Groundnut Oil Rice.

Please take note.
5531 2018-10-14 20:00:38 I gave you this car and still can’t even  do oil change I’m get this shit back mf
5532 2018-10-14 20:00:37 Our complete dependence on crude oil comes home to roost.

5535 2018-10-14 19:59:57 Have you seen his dhara cooking oil ad?
5536 2018-10-14 19:59:46 The great irony is that it is the same president who is trying to freeze the CAFE standard that would reduce US' oil dependency.
5537 2018-10-14 19:59:29 Hopeful of the Rand strengthening, international Oil prices declining & GOVT lowering fuel levies @RhMark @VioletsRFC #
5538 2018-10-14 19:59:17 Maybe if he dissed the snake oil salesmen like Pat Robertson, Franklin Graham etc
5539 2018-10-14 19:59:16 Sober October excludes cbd oil? That’s dumb
5540 2018-10-14 19:58:57 What the Ban oil thing...  Do IT.  Ban it.   I am in the H dept LOL
5541 2018-10-14 19:58:54 This is strange. I was thinking the wayward feather thing too. I would say try to spray coconut oil on that spot but that would probably get you bit.
5542 2018-10-14 19:58:47 Suppose saudi arabia became a western styled democracy over night...would that serve american interests? It's certainly not clear that everyone wins in that scenario. (Ie oil prices) Of course it would be great for humanitarian concerns.
5543 2018-10-14 19:58:41 Got oil leaking out my cup like Hasaan
5544 2018-10-14 19:58:29 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @theroygreenshow  Hey Roy -if you are anti Carbon Tax - will you also call for an end to all subsidies for big oil  tax breaks , refunds etc. 

 we have GLOBAL , Can Tax Payers Fed working with the CONservatives to go against the Fed Liberals in next Election
5545 2018-10-14 19:58:21 We defend middle eastern countries. With money and blood they should be giving us oil
5546 2018-10-14 19:58:03 This *is* the vegetable oil they sell in the US
5547 2018-10-14 19:58:03 See this one you no know say govt house rice sweet 
5548 2018-10-14 19:58:02 Te pareces a Massa;  la industria q visitó produce p el campo.  Miles de industrias de todo tipo venden al campo directa o indirectamente.
La recuperación xej de la producción de trigo significó mas de 200000 viajes p Moyano.
Tenes idea de los millones de lts de gas oil q usa?
5549 2018-10-14 19:57:49 I got more oil in water(like the Aaru films) than howl-around. Seemed very short, too
5550 2018-10-14 19:57:45 Most welders earn high 5 & some near 6 figures. Deep sea, oil rig, marine & salvage welders can make mid to high 6 figures. Easy.
5551 2018-10-14 19:57:44 Lol, right. Why do we even need NATO, when Europe is totally dependent on Russia for oil and gas? Why do we need the UN, whose membership hates us and Israel? Good riddance to these useless alliances.

The 1970s called, they want their bullshit back.
5552 2018-10-14 19:57:40 But if they’re self sufficient why would they need our oil?
5553 2018-10-14 19:57:38  Change your toothbrush every 3 months

 Organic or non fluoride toothpaste is really great, it helps your enamel

 Try oil pulling

 Always brush your teeth twice a day, morning and night
5554 2018-10-14 19:57:32 Noted.Saw oil prices retreating while this Kashoggi crises unfolding .High oil prices not good for GOP candidates come November elections.
But more interesting UK/France/Germany issuing joint communique to KSA.More like a shot across the bow to Trump to reconsider Iran policy.
5555 2018-10-14 19:57:30 Smoking tf outta my old oil 
5556 2018-10-14 19:57:27 There is no standard procedure. It is best to check the fluids/oil levels before driving up. Top up any that requires. Gear boxes are however senstive. Make sure you if it's ATF or CVT. If the later..don't top up. It's best to drain whats in and put fresh one.
5557 2018-10-14 19:57:25 Except to the degree that rhetoric about job loss often conflates expanding oil and gas (aided by new infrastructure) with maintaining employment in the sector, which may be achieved during a transition toward diversification.
5558 2018-10-14 19:57:22 I say we chop down trees, eat some animal flesh, frack for oil and other-wise go about our normal day in retaliation.
5559 2018-10-14 19:57:22 For the record, I was preparing my NEB/CEAA JRP Expert Testimony on the marine oil spill aspects of #NorthernGateway when @stephenharper took away the power the @NEBCanada had to allow major projects like that to proceed, giving that power to Cabinet instead. @TransMountain
5560 2018-10-14 19:57:09 Oil, dirt, cold.... Working on my friend's truck. It's a "nice" Sunday 
5561 2018-10-14 19:56:52 The New York Yankees are Freemason clones conducting a hyper-sigil!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
5562 2018-10-14 19:56:51 So you’re all for production of our own oil...got it. #stupidliberals only spout off never think things through and shows why it’s easy to make them hypocrites without much effort.
5563 2018-10-14 19:56:42 (1) Strange dream I had this morning - that the US+UK are planning various joint military offensives with one key objective to loot resources from other countries - like oil, metals, chemicals, etc. +right now trying to set up an effective way to covertly move these materials.
5564 2018-10-14 19:56:41 Is it ok to drink used motor oil and smoke weed?
5565 2018-10-14 19:56:41 Working in the US oil industry, I'm all for a Saudi embargo like '73. The impact on defense sales will hurt, but not too badly. We've got plenty of idle rigs that can go back in service.
5566 2018-10-14 19:56:37 Yup.

If you're shooting in LA any time soon, definitely head to the dispensaries there.  I know the head shop up the street from us sells the oil in a roller applicator, but Florida is still lagging in choice.
5567 2018-10-14 19:56:37 The Saudi's walked away from 911 like they had nothing to do with it. They will always be enemies of America. trump praises them because they fill his pockets. I say let them raise prices and boycott their oil.
5568 2018-10-14 19:56:33 @realDonaldTrump just know how to get oil arroud the world
5569 2018-10-14 19:56:24 they had better bow down to the oil and gas kings
5570 2018-10-14 19:56:17 You can see in historical documents that this regime was the conspiracy result of us back in 70,s.when iranian king refused to give cheap oil to us,they started a series of chaos in iran political situation and at last send their asset on airfrance to tehran!
5571 2018-10-14 19:56:17 Only slegging, happy 50th you big oil tanker 
5572 2018-10-14 19:56:09 @realDonaldTrump Why for Saudi Arabia to assassinate Khashoggi on consulate when are a lot of another places on Istanbul? Disappearance of Khashoggi are convenable only for Russia for selling more oil. Like GRU resident was simply for Khashoggi to simulate torture on Apple Watch.
5573 2018-10-14 19:56:09 Ay shawty tryna give u a shoulder rub with cbd oil
5574 2018-10-14 19:56:04 Sooo I take fish oil and when I tell people that had my number found out they decided it was an actual bird on Big Hero 6
5575 2018-10-14 19:56:02 Danny gets sardines or mackerel with his dinner every night. Not because he's spoilt, just because the oily fish is really good for his joints! Honest! He gets turmeric & coconut oil for his arthritis too. Works amazingly well for him.#FinnHour
5576 2018-10-14 19:55:59 Hi! The bottle is indeed glass with a UV protectant powder coating to protect the oil inside, because light is one of extra virgin olive oil’s biggest enemies, which is why clear glass is not good for the oil!
5577 2018-10-14 19:55:48 If I remember right, they're oil based crayons. Very soft and pigmented.
5578 2018-10-14 19:55:45 What lies beneath? Oil and/or money.
5579 2018-10-14 19:55:44 As much as I'm for the removal of the Glazers, something about this makes me uncomfortable. I guess we can't be the target of "oil money made you what you are" - Chelsea and City can keep that. But the association still sits strangely for a few reasons. For one, Sauda Arabia.
5580 2018-10-14 19:55:38 Really debating if I should visit Jarvis this Friday for Oil Spill 
5581 2018-10-14 19:55:31 Terrorists my ass,why they always find those terrorists in oil rich or stratigic locations? All those “terrorists” were provided with arms and money from west at some point to justify invasions. FYI i respect Ireland for their policy of military neutrality.
5582 2018-10-14 19:55:28 No oil
5583 2018-10-14 19:55:28 Anyone who remembers the Oil Embargo in 1973 understands that the fact that we still rely on foreign oil and aren't the world's leader in alternative energy is complete Bullshit. It's a real shame that these goals still don't seem to be on our horizon.
5584 2018-10-14 19:55:24 Yes definitely try clove oil Omari
5585 2018-10-14 19:55:13 me proofing bread: screaming IT LIVES, IT LIIIIIVES while slapping it around with olive oil covered hands
5586 2018-10-14 19:55:03 Agree Rob. If they’re walking away with any points on this next 3 game road week, McDavid/Talbot will nice again have to be the best players for this team, but they need the supporting staff to kick into gear as well. I’ll predict Draisaitl’s going to pick it up this wk..
5587 2018-10-14 19:54:55 The problem isn't whether they provide 10% or have less reserves. The problem is that they regulate the price for ALL oil worldwide.  Trump took the cork out of the bottle when he abandoned human rights as a norm...and now we will all pay the price.
5588 2018-10-14 19:54:53 Change the oil, if it hasn't been changed for a while, the plug too. If that doesn't work, it needs 'servicing' but not the type all these jeko gen repairers do ooo
5589 2018-10-14 19:54:53 I have been taking it since March! I take 20 drops in the morning and at night. I also started Vaping CBD Oil. It has helped in between doses.
5590 2018-10-14 19:54:47 what is "undefendable" here?
one of our anti-corruption champion @MrAyeDee already clarified the video for all concerned, according to him, the monies can be the bride-price for his eldest daughter that is getting married to an american oil & gas executive.
5591 2018-10-14 19:54:37 But, it's a super food and so good when it is roasted with a little olive oil, grated parmesan and garlic!
5592 2018-10-14 19:54:33 You live in medieval times accepting such a oppressive regime. We soon won’t need oil what are you going to do then?
5593 2018-10-14 19:54:27 You're claiming your system is privacy preserving when it's clearly not. That is selling snake oil. No amount of cotton wool around that changes that fact.
5594 2018-10-14 19:54:17 So basically your head is all coconut oil now
5595 2018-10-14 19:54:15 I need a oil change like yesterday
5596 2018-10-14 19:54:03 Out of CBD oil & colloidal silver *adds to cart*
5597 2018-10-14 19:53:54 My pleasure.  

No card needed for CBD oil provided that there's no THC in it.  We usually stock up on Diclofenac gel when we go to the UK, but CBD oil is nearly as good and no 'scrip needed
5598 2018-10-14 19:53:51 And maybe Canada should stop supporting them by not buying their oil?
5599 2018-10-14 19:53:38 Ordered Spanish olive oil, where I understand #oliveoil production is almost like regional #winemaking…#VivaEspaña !
5600 2018-10-14 19:53:25 I wonder how many fans will be at Lucas Oil Stadium for the next Colts home game?

5602 2018-10-14 19:53:14 Which role should I be looking for? -

I have a lot of technical experience developing and implementing analytical tools in Python using machine learning for the oil industry.

As I am 100% extroverted, sitting at a desk most of the day is really draining. I'm a problem solv…
5603 2018-10-14 19:53:14 We don’t need your oil. We are on our way to reduce our reliance on oil through sustainable energies.
5604 2018-10-14 19:53:08 1-5 Colts 
Vs
2-4 Bills 
Next week at Lucas Oil Stadium 
Estimated Attendance 30,000. 

For the Record we were better than 1-5 this time last year. Hard to believe in you Ballard. Very hard. This is a 3-13 Team IF THAT
5605 2018-10-14 19:53:08 we have a rosemary bush in our backyard left over from the previous owner and sometimes we treat ourselves to roast potato wedges with olive oil, salt, and rosemary. absolutely delicious.
5606 2018-10-14 19:53:02 so basically i microwaved coconut oil in order to put it in my hair but im an idiot and put it on straight out of the microwave and bc it was too hot burnt my scalp. then when i googled how to fix it it said “put coconut oil on it” which is ironic
5607 2018-10-14 19:52:48 Change the oil n plug. If possible empty the tank and sun dry it before pouring fuel again.
5608 2018-10-14 19:52:45 I’ve seen gummies and other random cbd stuff in the head shops here, but no oil. The dispensaries will probably have more options
5609 2018-10-14 19:52:37 Over the South Americq during the 20th century bc it suited them or the companies like Bonita. Same way they took down Ghadafi after 30 years of his dictatorship bc he didnt want to sell them oil. They dislike anyone who opposes then politically and are ready to go to war.
5610 2018-10-14 19:52:36 Money & Oil
5611 2018-10-14 19:52:36 i needed a oil change nun major lol
5612 2018-10-14 19:52:14 Jimana mufa rainin wayau ne bamaso ,tayaya za a chemana this video was cloned Sabuda Allah , kukenan kun raina mutane kuma baku tsoron Allah?
How can someone in his right senses say that video is cloned? I mean you can deny it in a better way pls, I thought you guys r wise.
5613 2018-10-14 19:52:05 Some people aren't trying to get connected to you, but they want the oil that's on the inside of you. Discern those who overlook your character just to be benefited by what you carry!
5614 2018-10-14 19:51:57 There honestly is no such thing as, “Sustainable palm oil”.
5615 2018-10-14 19:51:57 You mean #Khashoggi? Gee, this looks like a month of mysterious disappearances and unintended consequences. #DJT may delay any reactions until after Nov 6 but this world seems metastable. #Oil #SaudiArabia
5616 2018-10-14 19:51:55 Ethanol is a dishonest ripoff of the American taxpayers. It takes AT LEAST a gallon of oil to make a gallon of ethanol.  Ethanol subsidies are a tax scam that increase food prices for Americans & only help the top 1%.
5617 2018-10-14 19:51:44 You didn't read the article did you? Oil isn't worth anything in the ground. You can't get it out of the ground without significant capital investment. You invite businesses in to make that investment and then change the terms of the deal. That's stealing.
5618 2018-10-14 19:51:40 #How to Know When to Get Your Oil Changed  #article 145504 @netdatabiz
5619 2018-10-14 19:51:35 It would be so great to tell the Saudis where to go. But, they have the world by the hair with their oil. That’s why we need more Canadian energy entering the world markets, not less. Let’s landlock #Saudi oil not #Alberta #oil
5620 2018-10-14 19:51:09 It is at the core of the problem. Tesla and EVs in general are our answer to not just oil addiction but also the single most pressing challenge to all mankind in this age - the risk of catastrophic climate change. Join the revolution.
5621 2018-10-14 19:50:49 Saudi is going to come out swinging..they could cut off the supply of oil or send the price so high that no one could afford it!
5622 2018-10-14 19:50:48 As opposed to your organised propaganda in favour of the disgraceful House of Saud (you on the payroll by any chance?) The only reason Western govts tolerate this is the oil money/defence contracts. I'm satisfied of the Saudi state's complicity, I don't need it proved in court.
5623 2018-10-14 19:50:46 Exactly. Cannabis club members and other people have been using oil for years. They have knowledge and are able to help with real products and dosage.
5624 2018-10-14 19:50:46 Sarkin yan rainin yawo..
Alafiya dai.
5625 2018-10-14 19:50:41 You're missing the point. Saudi Arabia as you have pointed out is not the only source of oil. The problem is that we have coddled a terrorist regime for the sake of cheap oil.
5626 2018-10-14 19:50:33 Nifa rainin wayau ne banso, wai cloned
5627 2018-10-14 19:50:29 Oh, and CBD oil is also pretty cheap, completely legal in Florida and available in nearly any head shop.
5628 2018-10-14 19:50:25 Enjoy what! Your son is posting crap smear tactics against a journalist murdered by Saudi Arabia and because the US gets oil and arms sales, you will eventually do bugger all. Listing to more of your Whitehouse crap? No thanks.
5629 2018-10-14 19:50:05 My suggestion to America is to stop creating conditions in Central America that gives rise to refugees . The fucking half witted Orange Fungus is contemplating military action in Venezuela `no doubt at the urging of oil corporations
5630 2018-10-14 19:50:04 What she did with Oil and Gas shows her gross experience , lack of care and gives the lie to any degree of academic competency. As an addicted viewer of Question Time I regard her as having a poor grasp and control of her portfolio.
5631 2018-10-14 19:50:01 Airport and trains and many of things will be closed soon hhhhha. Without our oil the world is nothing.
5632 2018-10-14 19:49:52 Boli and palm oil
5633 2018-10-14 19:49:43 It’s oil sands not tar sands. Get a grip
5634 2018-10-14 19:49:39 Make sure your announcing sanctions on the Saudi oil industry. & start paying Canada market value for the oil you buy! no more 50%+ discount. #cdnpoli Support your #allies
5635 2018-10-14 19:49:38 Ladies invest in exfoliating gloves. Make you a GOOD moisturizing body wash. #MangoButter

Scrub away them frustrations!!!

I feel like a whole new person after that scrub! 

Had my oil diffuser going. Solange playing. 

No longer irritated. Feeling rather fuckin Queenly.


5636 2018-10-14 19:49:36 United States has the option to use its own oil resources.
5637 2018-10-14 19:49:14 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
5638 2018-10-14 19:49:13 Dunno.  Maybe, maybe not.  Do know that we may now be seeing CNY oil be weaponized against the US for the 1st (but unlikely the last time.). CNY oil changes the power dynamics in Mideast towards oil producers, away fr USD producer (US.)
5639 2018-10-14 19:49:05 #SaudiArabia threatens to respond after Trump's warning of severe consequences over disappearance of #Khashoggi, citing "vital role in global economy"
 #SaudiArabia exported 876,000 b/d of oil to the US back in July, according to figures by the #EIA
To me its all hot air
5640 2018-10-14 19:48:46 @realDonaldTrump Looks like our most respected President ever is going to have to bow down  to MBS due to his threat to jack up the price of oil 500%. Not to mention jumping in bed with the Russkies and dumping our best friend Israel. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Un is watching! Me oh my!
5641 2018-10-14 19:48:39 Smelling like coconut oil and cocoa butter is top ten best scents 
5642 2018-10-14 19:48:20 Virgin pa ko sa coconut oil e
5643 2018-10-14 19:48:19 Well it’s a start. I mean since the abominable treatment of women and gays isn’t  enough, nor is the horrific human catastrophe in Yemen, then let this be the tipping point. I guess we don’t need their oil or investments as much as we used to 
5644 2018-10-14 19:48:19 Pursue oil alternatives
5645 2018-10-14 19:48:10 As of right now we’re are planning on an acre for CBD oil next year, this will be for a local new startup so it will be very touch and go but willing to chance it for only an acre
5646 2018-10-14 19:48:10 He smashed my friend, girl it’s true. Heard his dick smell like coconut oil lmaoo
5647 2018-10-14 19:48:06 Your oil is not even enough to be covering for all states . So you need us bro !
5648 2018-10-14 19:48:05 Hopefully 5-11 is just bad enough to get them a real coach instead of keeping this snake oil salesmen
5649 2018-10-14 19:47:49 Contender for the Nigerian presidency under the Peoples Democratic party, former Vice president Atiku Abubakar has been involved in massive oil bunkering and even arms running, according to United States sources as revealed in Wikileaks Cables dated 9th January 2009.
5650 2018-10-14 19:47:48 You've got all the rights to violate Human Rights If your country is rich in Oil like #SaudiArabia!  #Khashoggi
5651 2018-10-14 19:47:47 Saudi Arabia is within the top biggest 20 economies and it only exports oil. This non sense conspiracy will cost us a lot. #khashoggi #JamalKhashoggi #Jamal_Khashoggi
5652 2018-10-14 19:47:36 Agree, and with it, an important message: Leverage is shifting away fr the US to others, aided in some small part by the ability to say “We’ll price our oil in CNY.”  US leverage in the region is falling, rapidly
5653 2018-10-14 19:47:31 We have been walking a tightrope with them since the1950's.  American Business and big Oil & Drilling Corp have been doing business there long time.  My 6th grade teacher lived there in late '50 while her husband was working on engineering projects. Britain also bows to them.
5654 2018-10-14 19:47:19 Just helps his friend Vlad get richer. Sanctions are offset by increasing price of oil
5655 2018-10-14 19:47:06 I admit, though, it would be neat to see the energy innovation such a large oil spike would create. (Though presumably some of it would just be more fracking.)
5656 2018-10-14 19:47:04 No...im definetly more Danni Dyer. 
5657 2018-10-14 19:46:49 Did you see the oil or grease saturating the back of Kershaw's hat in game 2? Total disgrace to the game and dangerous to the players.
5658 2018-10-14 19:46:46 US is the biggest oil producer, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves. Blame OPEC cartel & speculation. Trump is unhappy with cartels he can't control, the high oil prices already, and  isn't a opec member.
5659 2018-10-14 19:46:40 They have a whole lot more money than Vince...that piece I wrote was dead on..it’s all about Oil ...they will use it as leverage!
5660 2018-10-14 19:46:40 I kinda feel like "ofe ǹsàlà" in that song was a reference to crude oil that makes the "million dollar" that comes after it, make some more sense.

5666 2018-10-14 19:46:27 I use olive oil to cook with. We have margarine, but no one eats it.
5667 2018-10-14 19:46:26 Back in the 80's when there was carburetors, the oil companies were buying up anything that would make cars or trucks get better fuel mileage. Some that wouldn't sell have had mysterious deaths.
5668 2018-10-14 19:46:21 If the int’l price is 500 bbls per oz of gold, if USD gold/oil ratio is 15x like it is today, US oil is the most expensive oil in the world by a huge margin.  No one will want US oil prices at 1/15 oz of gold when Saudi/Russian oil is trading at 1/500 oz.
5669 2018-10-14 19:46:11 Even in a small city\town like where I grew up the rents are ridicules.  What used to go for $450.00 a month now is getting $1500.00 a month!  With nothing included!  No elec, no sewer\water, no free parking, and no oil heat!  The latter is the killer money wise.

5671 2018-10-14 19:46:04 GAHDAMN you Keto Diet, this is very hard no salt, juice, chips, very very minimal oil for my chicken and just greens. It’s harder then I thought. #Commitment don’t believe me just watch
5672 2018-10-14 19:46:02 I think most reasonable State fans admit that they always knew Mullen was a prick, but he was THEIR prick. And a great coach. Same thing with OM fans recognizing some of what Hugh was selling was snake oil. But he took us to heights previously unseen, so we didn’t care.
5673 2018-10-14 19:45:59 @MehrTarar.ur leader is standing with ksa for oil on deffered payments.
5674 2018-10-14 19:45:59 We are no longer dependent on Saudi’s for oil. Most of our oil comes from Canada.
5675 2018-10-14 19:45:38 Maybe? So is that maybe a yes you have worked on an oil rig? In what capacity did you work on the rig?
5676 2018-10-14 19:45:29 If we cut oil from us the prices will rise dramatically. Therefore we won’t need to sell as much oil and there will always be a high demand on oil in Asia especially from China and India.
5677 2018-10-14 19:45:28 Even in a scenario where KSA falls, still unlikely in the present moment, there are still a number of emerging economies that are reliant on oil as their main export. Climate proponents have to change incentives so if these countries abandon oil their people dont starve

5682 2018-10-14 19:45:02 Yep, and the media is all over Trump for not doing anything about the journalist. They seem to forget that we also sell them military vehicles and import their oil.  The ME is crazy and we have to pick which level of crazy we are going to accept.

5688 2018-10-14 19:44:43 I’ve washed it with ACV, Indian Healing clay and olive oil. Never baking soda though. May need to try that! 
5689 2018-10-14 19:44:41 Yes, oil could skyrocket. That's that price of being held over a barrel (i guess that's intended?). They should be held absolutely responsible if they did in fact have something to do with it. Besides, we shouldn't be giving them weapons to destroy Yemen anyway.....
5690 2018-10-14 19:44:35 Or palm oil
5691 2018-10-14 19:44:32 Ya well don’t forget ya gotta cook your food an you just might freeze or sweat your ass off..takes oil to do it all...US has oil we produce..the rest of the world would suffer!

5694 2018-10-14 19:44:15 Putin sells a lot of gas and oil.
5695 2018-10-14 19:44:14 I believe the USA has enough oil resources to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia. We shouldn't fold over "threats" that may just be speculations. Help our corn farmers and use ethanol to fuel our cars.
5696 2018-10-14 19:44:08 Next to McDavid. Talbot has been by far and away the Oilers best player through three games. Kept them in all three and gave them a chance, which is all he can do.
5697 2018-10-14 19:44:01 Cheap oil has completely impeded other, much more efficient and fast means of travel. Cheap oil has only served to enable excessive dependency on automobile travel. This has not in any way, shape or form helped our country. We are worse off as a result.
5698 2018-10-14 19:43:44 I don't want subsides for ANYONE anymore. Farmers, oil diggers, ship builders, rich assholes anywhere. Pay your tax or fuck off & leave. That's my policy.
5699 2018-10-14 19:43:23 I'm living in Alberta, literally floating on oil & gas. We'd be more than fine.

5701 2018-10-14 19:43:12 Ren centifola balm cleanser, the ordinary salycillic acid and my brooklyn herborium oil and spray moisturizer
5702 2018-10-14 19:43:09 This is how the Globalist British govt forced us into Iraq and Iran became Stronger. If you are truly concerned about Human rights, look no further than Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon where British and French govts are committing GENOCIDE for oil
5703 2018-10-14 19:43:03 All the research I’ve read says u need a combo of both. It’s something to do with the cannabinol receptors in our bodies. Mj oil/edibles work great for sleep and  pain. The right thc/cbd combo also helps me with depression. But of course no insurance covers. FSO is $$ in CA.
5704 2018-10-14 19:42:56 Hush puppies are nothing more than Wonder bread with the crust removed and rolled into a ball and deep fried to clean the fryer oil and the locals think it's a delicacy
5705 2018-10-14 19:42:55 A shit load. They're the number one single source. It only serves as a subsidy to an incredibly inefficient and economically draining means of transportation for which the majority of oil is used for.
5706 2018-10-14 19:42:47 North American oil producers would love that.
5707 2018-10-14 19:42:44 They don't know what Saudi Arabia is 
They think just have it oil hahaha
5708 2018-10-14 19:42:34 They're not a good long-term investment anyway. When they run out of oil, KSA's entire economy will change.

5717 2018-10-14 19:41:18  The stock market will bounce next week.  It's called a "technical bounce" because all the selling over the last week will trigger algos to buy.  Then we probably stay in a holding pattern for a short while. 

Still expecting oil to drop into midterms. 66ish
5718 2018-10-14 19:41:17 How is revenue generated? By intelligent people. KPIs fell, not because of oil prices, but because Buhari took 6 months to appoint ministers. Foreign investors took their investments away bcos of the uncertainties of Buhari's ineptitude. Buhari cannot create wealth.
5719 2018-10-14 19:41:03 And off shore drilling is part of the economy. We do it responsibly as opposed to bowing down to the middle eastern depending on their oil. Get with the program the dems way is of working
5720 2018-10-14 19:40:59 Said differently - now that CNY oil is live, Russia/Saudi can use ratio of gold/oil to control the int’l trade value of USD any time they see fit, which is why I’ve said all along CNY oil had potential to be game changer.

5728 2018-10-14 19:40:12 if not for imported oil artificially inexpensive as a result of our pathetic foreign policy and relationship with Saudi Arabia, our economic output would be DRAMATICALLY higher. We'd be better off in virtually every category of measurable wealth. This is a fact.

5733 2018-10-14 19:40:01 This is aces! The quote explains why we (i.e., "the Right") insist on continually subsidizing fossil fuels—profiting Big Oil—while blocking sustainable energy, over LESS-COSTLY subsidies, that would serve us all so much better. "Conservative" just means "subsidizing preexisting."

5739 2018-10-14 19:39:15 Yes.  If Russia/Saudi make gold worth > in oil terms than on paper, US will be forced to choose to either allow gold to rise to the new px (ie USD dn big) or to allow the px of oil to collapse to reflect the higher Gold/oil ratio, destroying US shale sector (RU/KSA wld win share)
5740 2018-10-14 19:39:07 Wake up voters! While you get increased bills on gas, oil, electricity, carbon taxes, levies, stealth charges, rates, VAT, etc - your TD's are screwing you more.

5744 2018-10-14 19:39:00 Getting off oil won't happen overnight, but obviously it's got to happen fast. Pipelines can be repurposed. The u.s. is going to need Canadian water in the future. Let the oil companies pay for those pipelines, and reuse them a few years down the road.
5745 2018-10-14 19:38:41 Have you seen what's happening to the deficit? That has always been a fight for us and now we don't care? EPA has turned into a "deregulate at all costs" with major studies showing the harm these actions will have on us. Oil lobby runs the show. $ ahead of protections.

I’m just wondering what kind of growth you’re seeing since starting up. I would imagine this is intriguing to a lot of rig (oil) operators.

5755 2018-10-14 19:37:38 When the government forces citizens to pay for jobs in other industries. That’s what the GOP said with clean energy subsidies. Forgetting about oil subsidies. Or milk or corn. Forcing gas companies to put more ethanol into their produce to shore up the corn industry

5772 2018-10-14 19:35:44 Hey supreme oil patterns right there bud
5773 2018-10-14 19:35:34 I just found wet oil paint on the toilet seat, I actually hate painters
5774 2018-10-14 19:35:33 Just because you finally realized you’re in the wrong doesn’t mean that we’re gonna be friends again ohh honey you burnt that bridge and spilt oil in the water I’m good sis
5775 2018-10-14 19:35:30 Just saw it that some people use baby oil to cook.  Like how?
5776 2018-10-14 19:35:26 Baby oil
5777 2018-10-14 19:35:26 My hands smell like oil & grease.

Love it.
5778 2018-10-14 19:35:24 I'm glad they are trying and listening.  Pain & nausea are fatiguing and draining on their own.  I have a fish oil based supplement that my ND prescribes, it is the best thing I added to my routine.
5779 2018-10-14 19:35:18 Because the majority of the oil in America isn’t the oil we consume or depend on its heavy and doesn’t convert to gasoline very well if at all
5780 2018-10-14 19:35:02 I don't understand why our oil being ethical is important, but it's okay to do arms deals and give our Wheatboard to those who produce "unethical" oil. Makes no sense.
5781 2018-10-14 19:35:00 Technology isn’t like MidEast oil. Nations buy Israeli technology because it’s some of the advanced in the world
5782 2018-10-14 19:34:57 When will Canadian gov't force Canadian companies to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia! I Don't want my fillup dollars going to SA! #cdnpoli
5783 2018-10-14 19:34:47 Ethical oil is oil that stays in the ground and we just fawn over its beautiful potential, while enjoying a lovely pinot noir.
5784 2018-10-14 19:34:45 Quite frankly, YOUR country needs us and our supplies more than WE need your oil.
5785 2018-10-14 19:34:38 Africa is sitting on the world's 30% natural resources. In 40 years Africa is going to be the largest exporter of Diamond, salt and oil. You know what this means-"Black people may or may not be attending the @oscar8 , but they will be manufacturing them." @Africa @unwomenafrica
5786 2018-10-14 19:34:31 Important points, thanks. As the % of oil in the transport sector falls (& hence impact of price spike on GDP falls) these implicit pressures on US decisionmaking also have less impact.
5787 2018-10-14 19:34:31 You can cure just about anything with pedialyte and CBD oil
5788 2018-10-14 19:34:20 Stop buy their oil, and don't sell them anymore military equipment!
5789 2018-10-14 19:34:20 Is it possible Argan Oil is just chicken fat?
5790 2018-10-14 19:34:17 There’d already be a sub-section of the GOP agitating to “keep right on going after Mexico to Venezuela and keep the oil”.
5791 2018-10-14 19:34:07 I forsure was off the oil 
5792 2018-10-14 19:34:05 Tried out beard oils today, and I really have to say that @BeardsAndBeaver Spruced Up oil is probably one of the best smelling things I own
5793 2018-10-14 19:34:02 Mix equal parts coconut oil and sugar for a DIY hand exfoliator! #manicure
5794 2018-10-14 19:33:55 Yes and that is where the #GreenPeace and #environmental idiots are hurting our #oil Industry.  We used to #deliver a lot more stuff to Schools from Oil Companies.
5795 2018-10-14 19:33:43 Do the Saudis have a lot of USD invested with US banks and equities? To more safely allow them the option of implementing the threat of selling oil for CNY,  my guess is that money will be leaving the US ASAP. Doesn't bode well for US stocks IMHO.
5796 2018-10-14 19:33:40 I didn’t use oil! It was heat protectant , I just trying to protect your curls
5797 2018-10-14 19:33:38 มันน่าตลกอย่างนึง ขี่เลยแม่สายไป ไปไหนก็ไม่รู้ ไปแม่งให้หมด จนเจอด่านตรวจ2ด่าน เลยแบบเอ๊ะไรมันวะ แต่เขาไม่ได้จับไร ก็ไปเรื่อยๆจนเจอคนพูดแปลกๆเลยวนกลับแม่งเลย แล้วมาเจอป้าย ยินดีต้อนรับสู่ประเทศไทย ฮะ กูขี่ไปไหนมา ออกนอกประเทศหรอ 555

5799 2018-10-14 19:33:15 Price of oil going up when they shut off the supply.
5800 2018-10-14 19:33:15 + the strategic component: USA & KSA about to enter into major alliance & arms deal of seismic proportions. De facto USA/KSA oil cartel secures global energy markets. No reason for KSA to risk all with a hit out of a bad mob movie. But plenty of actors with reasons to frame MBS.
5801 2018-10-14 19:33:08 If Trump wanted to really make America great he would shun the oil companies and call for true energy independence, fuel efficient vehicles, and alternative energy. Then tell the Saudis to take a hike. No business is worth being associated with truly terrible people.
5802 2018-10-14 19:33:05 Well, since we export more oil than Saudi Arabia, I'm guessing we'll do just fine. Besides, we need to be kicked away from carbon-based fuels, so please DO. Make it more expensive!

5804 2018-10-14 19:33:01 Once the oil hits your head, you automatically get a target put on your heart. God never anoints anyone without putting them on the altar... Be prepared for unbelievable sacrifice.
5805 2018-10-14 19:33:01 A good leave in or a curl refresher. Ive even sprayed plain water in my hair & finished with oil.
5806 2018-10-14 19:32:41 Lemming know when: the local store is cheap if you’re xerus about saving money. It’s open Saturdays & Sundamys.  In the past I used to pika you up but you can boromys keys. We’ll gopher castor oil and my son’s cereal. We can paca histryx in my backpack to save space in the cart.
5807 2018-10-14 19:32:39 Ethical oil is an oxymoron.
5808 2018-10-14 19:32:37 Yesterday I saw a report on CNBC, crude oil price is declining in international market, but impact of it will appear in market after a fortnight. Let keep finger cross, will it visible.
5809 2018-10-14 19:32:24 I need the oil changed in my car 
5810 2018-10-14 19:32:22 The oil industry pays good more than $12/hr, you don’t need a high school diploma. Look into it .
5811 2018-10-14 19:32:15 If the #Saudis killed #Khashoggi &
#Trump did respond, I'm sure the #Saudi reaction would more then likely be an #Oil related response.

A lot of missing variables at this point.
5812 2018-10-14 19:32:11 This is stupid and uninformed headline. We have recently become an oil exporter for the first time in like 50 years. Who gives a crap what they threaten?

5816 2018-10-14 19:31:51 I’ve been in Walmart for a hour waiting on an oil change 
5817 2018-10-14 19:31:51 There is enough oil in the world for the price to be under $50 a barrel for a lifetime - but oil economies tighten supply for their own benefit - were all on a merry go round #oil
5818 2018-10-14 19:31:39 Gee, maybe we should consider building some pipelines and reducing our reliance on Saudi oil...  #EnergyEast #TransMountain
5819 2018-10-14 19:31:32 Isn't it Europe that gets most of its oil from the Saudis? Correct me if I'm wrong.

5823 2018-10-14 19:31:21 That stream isn't any worse than the garbage coming from coal plants, oil refineries,  etc.,  but it's a fact of life.
5824 2018-10-14 19:31:12 @SaudiEmbassyUSA Pissing off the world when you're a desert country completely dependent on foreign food imports is probably not a winning strategy.  If your oil leaves the world market it's merely inconvenient for us. If our food leaves your tables, you're gone. Don't go there.
5825 2018-10-14 19:31:09 But there is no investment because of the threat of expropriation. Once Chavez stole the oil companies, nobody else would take the risk.

5833 2018-10-14 19:30:23 I will try to get it. Cold pressed hemp oil is available in Dutch supermarkets as a over the counter. 5 drops of 2% worked wonders for permanent pain.
5834 2018-10-14 19:30:20 Half-truths, at best. Saudi’s can do anything they please. As far as oil, even you know there are places in the world that would love to get their oil and be in the good graces of the Saudi’s.

5839 2018-10-14 19:29:58 With all those arms and oil deals I very much doubt there will be any lasting policy shift toward Saudi.
To this day I still don't know why Union Jack was lowered upon death of Saudi king. It doesn't happen for any other foreign leader.
5840 2018-10-14 19:29:55 And Canadian oil will still be $20 a barrel! Thanks B.C.!

5842 2018-10-14 19:29:51 I believe this conversation is about oil, not coal.
5843 2018-10-14 19:29:51 Saudi Arabia has rejected us, Canadian and European pressure to accept deals and agreements, including the waiver of Jerusalem and the Palestinian state, the reduction of oil prices and interference in its internal affairs.   So look how you are complaining about it and try to
5844 2018-10-14 19:29:49 I'm hard-pressed to see what the Saudis could do to get oil to $200 that wouldn't hurt them more than the US.  They are still fairly dependent on sales of that commodity.
5845 2018-10-14 19:29:45 What...no cold pressed hemp seed oil ??

5848 2018-10-14 19:29:37 @KoinangeJeff was @johnallannamu knocking on the wrong gate, or are you doing PR for the bad guys of Southern Sudan? Your questions today were generally unlike you. Documentary raised issues on tenders not oil money. How could you miss that? #SundayLive

5850 2018-10-14 19:29:32 I voted for you because I thought you were ready to be part of the solution. Building more pipelines is NOT how we move towards the clean energy economy that we're all doomed without. Oil no longer equals wealth; not for me or my children. Let's see some innovation. #abpoli
5851 2018-10-14 19:29:02 The Jamal Khashoggi case is hotting up.

5860 2018-10-14 19:28:15 Watch we'll turn the planet blue and we will we will never give up we will never let these ignorant racist bastards destroy the planet and they will be eating oil may not be in 10 years or 20 but in 50 if we still have a planet they'll be eating oil or we will all be dead anyway!

5862 2018-10-14 19:28:10 I hope it's due to Repubs majorities right now? They're beholden to Big Oil, and aren't going to work on solutions. Or perhaps Trump's daily scandals are taking up all the attention...

5877 2018-10-14 19:27:07 60M a year is a small amount when the Oil Patch is loosing 50 million a day under Liberal Policies and restricted access to World Markets and Tide water. Another Liberal Lie, the real issue is more like 18.2 billion dollars a year lost under Liberal mismanagement of the Economy.

Urgh!!!
5882 2018-10-14 19:26:54 the US is an oil producing country and gets the majority of its oil from Canada and Venezuela; two countries Trump has no hesitancy about shitting on

5884 2018-10-14 19:26:52 My fellow Jamaicans gotta realise oil isn’t gravy.
5885 2018-10-14 19:26:48 Drilling for oil to make tires and plastics is a much different proposition to melting tar sands using huge quantities of water and energy, just to burn it again in your internal combustion engine. Small steps preferable to going backwards.
5886 2018-10-14 19:26:43 If we were here to sell "snake oil" we surely would not be investing the funds we accumulated in enhancing the blockchain, financial ecosystem and developing products. 95% of "projects" have cut bait and ran, so the skepticism is warranted. But we are on the cusp of something big

5891 2018-10-14 19:25:53 We barely rely on these assholes for oil anymore, so it may drive up prices due to a rush on oil (and the inevitable price spike that comes from a demand surge), but I’ll gladly pay $4/gallon gas to get rid of these anchors.
5892 2018-10-14 19:25:50 Said differently, if Saudi and Russia agreed tomorrow to value physical gold at 500 barrels of Saudi or Russian oil, gold would be more than liquid enough to settle oil and commodity trade globally.  This is a political question, not an economic one.
5893 2018-10-14 19:25:37 Amount of oil from SA is negligible. It will hurt them a lot more than us. If they killed an innocent man who also happens to be a journalist and a US resident, then sanctions are warranted.
5894 2018-10-14 19:25:31 whyyyy tf do i keep getting EMAILS about CBD OIL
5895 2018-10-14 19:25:24 I fear, In the end nothing will happen, all the actors have too much to lose, the saudis, turkey,the US, in the worst case the whole world economy will break down, if sa creates a oil crises as retaliation.
5896 2018-10-14 19:25:13 I put way too much Rosehip oil on and now I'm an oily mess
5897 2018-10-14 19:25:08 It would have been hard to do then.  But now we have more oil and we have electric cars.  There's no reason to support murderous dictators for things we don't need.
5898 2018-10-14 19:25:06 The truth is US will let this go not because we are a fond of your people or culture, rather because we are sucking up your oil for cheap and making you pay for our technology and weapons, there is an old saying the dog sat under the tree and saw the shade as himself
5899 2018-10-14 19:25:00 Arborviate essential oil tip: Apply topically to help reduce yeast in the body.
5900 2018-10-14 19:24:55 Certainly good for US oil industry. Maybe not so for the rest of economy. Price increases due to supply shocks were considered a net negative for US economy. Maybe that changed recently due to Shale revolution. An easier question is whether Saudis can afford reduced exports.

5903 2018-10-14 19:24:48 And barry burned the midnight oil?  gmafb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5904 2018-10-14 19:24:37 I have a few things that help, but they don't help consistently.  Melatonin (probably spelled that wrong) only works well once every few days.  A hot bath with epsom salts and lavender oil helps every three days.  GABA helps pretty consistently but not enough on its own Ideas?
5905 2018-10-14 19:24:28 Young man!We are conversing and no one is stressing anyone here!I have access to any data and infortion you think you do have.

My point is debt levels relative to revenue earnings now is not sustainable.We can stay afloat now cos oil prices still much high.
5906 2018-10-14 19:24:21 Need a gallon of tea tree oil for these mosquito bites
5907 2018-10-14 19:24:17 "fish are born in the sea and die in oil "
       Quote from Nice in southern France where fish are used to the extent locally for dishes that it has given rise to that saying over there.

5908 2018-10-14 19:24:17 The USA should stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia.
5909 2018-10-14 19:24:12 Its true though. Your hair must naturally retain moisture well. Oil does not provide moisture water is required for that.
5910 2018-10-14 19:24:07 Orange - That thing invades all your senses. 

Also because it was given to me after an unhealthy does of Castor Oil at an ungodly hour
5911 2018-10-14 19:24:07 While Los Angeles has a thriving oil and gas industry, pumps downtown.  #Hypocrites #ableg #bcpoli and #TrudeauInIndia dances w terrorists and offend all priority
5912 2018-10-14 19:24:06 Now there's an unpopular opinion:  "The future of civilization depends upon $1000/barrel oil."
5913 2018-10-14 19:24:00 Between US and Canadian oil production and reserves, we have several lifetimes of oil available and don’t need Middle East oil. It’s about trump enriching himself.
5914 2018-10-14 19:23:59 Also, there is free running water, and also crazy expensive bottled water. The same could be said of data, but not really about oil.
5915 2018-10-14 19:23:58 In an oil rich nation children are starving.
5916 2018-10-14 19:23:55 so me untaré jamaican castor oil en el cuero cabelludo 1 vez a la semana a ver qué pasa
5917 2018-10-14 19:23:51 Do you know that Buhari use the crude oil in the Naija Delta as collateral to borrowed money from China?
5918 2018-10-14 19:23:43 Of course that's a very valid question! I would assume that an independent Scotland would actually lower tax for oil companies so they can keep producing in a business friendly environment so my personal  projection would be 10% less tax generated and 20% more oil & gas jobs safe
5919 2018-10-14 19:23:32 The U.S. has for decades been way too close to the authoritarian Saudi regime.  First, it was primarily due to oil. Later, the Saudi rift with Iran became a significant factor.  Now, it’s the planes & arms.  It’s not in America’s interests to be this close to this autocracy!
5920 2018-10-14 19:23:18 Well I hate to say it but the oil belongs to multi nationals and taxed by the UK because you muppets can't even run a tap let alone a government. The oil is used for the betterment of the UK and not a self few brigadoon watchers
5921 2018-10-14 19:23:16 I came to the shop for an oil change and I’ve been here for over an hour, now the entire staff is around my car just looking dumbfounded. no one said do all that, just change the oil. I know Betty has issues, just let her be 
5922 2018-10-14 19:22:43 also I have to buy my cleansing oil and serum tmr asdfghjkl
5923 2018-10-14 19:22:28 Agree.. another oil embargo (last was in 1970s) would hurt short term but would be a great long term boon.
5924 2018-10-14 19:22:24 I have dehydrated skin but I’ve started using The Ordinary’s rose hip oil with a little bit of my moisturizer at night and it’s been a game changer
5925 2018-10-14 19:22:04 You should cry on a regular basis. It’s basically an oil change for the soul.
5926 2018-10-14 19:22:03 You know the government provided every dollar for the Manhatten Project. This is why a carbon tax is to be imposed, to make those who use carbon, specifically oil and gas to subsidize the government funding green energy technology.
5927 2018-10-14 19:22:02 Ana shoved the flyer towards Liam. He read out loud: “Metropolitan Museum. Secrets of the Sands – Art of Ancient Persia. So what?”
“Here,” she stabbed the paper with her nail. “An oil #lamp. Presumably, 4 century BC. The genie is here. We’ve got to get to her first.” #vss365
5928 2018-10-14 19:21:59 My kids fav. Olive oil. Butter. Skins on, rock salt and a bit of rosemary. They taste best caramelized and a bit wrinkly.
5929 2018-10-14 19:21:59 
This man, you don dey smoke engine oil abi?
5930 2018-10-14 19:21:56 Personally i think a lot of things are not real in Lagos. 
Goat meat doesn’t taste like it.
Fresh cray fish doesn’t taste like one
Cat fish doesn’t taste like it. 
Palm oil doesn’t taste like it.  
You can add urs

If you are a south south/ SE fellow, you will def understand me.
5931 2018-10-14 19:21:48 Ever try to eat oil?  Y'all are making the Iranians look like the good guys.
5932 2018-10-14 19:21:45 You better give your girlfriend some damn credit. Disturbing me to oil it everyday  mschewww 
5933 2018-10-14 19:21:42 Just read that only 11% of our oil comes from S.A. these days, so they can stuff it.
5934 2018-10-14 19:21:40 Ebonyi state palm oil to be precise
5935 2018-10-14 19:21:37 I'm no expert but getting a nail oil/jajoba oil can help keep them hydrated and happy, and keeping nail polish (even just a clear coat) really reinforces them
5936 2018-10-14 19:21:33 Is the price of #oil about to get out of control? #Saudi
5937 2018-10-14 19:21:28 Nothing says family fun like a functioning oil rig.
5938 2018-10-14 19:21:23 Whatever Demerrius had on his oil drink was fye! I was fucking it up.
5939 2018-10-14 19:21:17 South Sudan Former military Chief Paul Malong(paraphrased) : I'm  in Nairobi "resting"with my kids. I will open a case against Kenyan documentary accusing me of plundering S.Sudan's oil wealth.
My being chased from South Sudan will happen to others if a proper system is not put.
5940 2018-10-14 19:21:14 lot! And don´t use Exfoliation every day. 2-3 times a week is enough! 
To moist the skin I like:
Troiareuke A.G.T.Hydro Essence
Rosehip Oil
Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence from Skinfood
Oil Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion Cosrx
Klairs Supple Preparation Toner
Missha Sheetmasks
5941 2018-10-14 19:21:08 Yeah, okay, Matt.  Nothing behind "oil money" at all.  Perfectly normal thing to say when discussing a club.
5942 2018-10-14 19:20:54 @jessconte I took the quiz and I was recommended magnesium, B-complex, vitamin D and fish oil!
5943 2018-10-14 19:20:54 Big oil should be long AMZN
5944 2018-10-14 19:20:54 Hopefully I can get done with my homework at a decent time so I can do a hot oil treatment/deep condition and take a bath .
5945 2018-10-14 19:20:53 This might be your history but let me tell you about my history, we came to a desert where your people were eating lizards and living in tents, we gave you ligitimacy, protection and knowledge and in return we secured your oil for our energy needs....
5946 2018-10-14 19:20:47 Burning the midnite oil.
5947 2018-10-14 19:20:27 @realDonaldTrump The fourth day of November is near the end of Iran's oil and the end of the Iranian regime.
5948 2018-10-14 19:20:22 i tried a quick search and only came across articles saying why we should eat MORE saturated fat 

what exactly do you mean by "harder to burn"? because the impression it gives is that eating 100 cals of coconut oil will somehow make you fatter than 100 calories of anything +
5949 2018-10-14 19:20:19 Subtle but cheapened things like lacking the dedicated hearing vents in the floor and B pillars for the rear passengers, a simplification of the instrument cluster, a space filler 'Citroen' logo where S1 ans earlier S2 cars had an oil temp and / or turbo pressure gauge.
5950 2018-10-14 19:20:17 Dear John, prepare your bicycle for very long trip to your work.
We can rise oil prices up to 100$ per gallon!And you'll cry.
5951 2018-10-14 19:20:08 What is your obsession with pipelines? We need to focus on renewables.  It's a crime Canadian politicians allowed fracking dirty oil in the first place.
5952 2018-10-14 19:20:05 Butternut squash, sweet potatoes, apples, onions, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, olive oil. Roast until butternut squash and sweet potatoes are soft to eat

5954 2018-10-14 19:20:03 Whichever currency Saudi says is liquid enough.  If Saudi said tomorrow that “Beanie Babies are now our preferred reserve asset, not USTs”, Beanie Baby values would skyrocket to prices high enough to clear Saudi oil.  Russia & Iran actions suggest gold = “Beanie Babies”?
5955 2018-10-14 19:20:00 We go get our oil changed today and the mechanic says to josh “oh I remember you, you got a flat tire on your wedding day” yup that’d be him. Missed the bridal party pictures and showed up 20 mins before the wedding 
5956 2018-10-14 19:19:56 is it not the time to increase margin requirements for Oil?  #Oil #forex
5957 2018-10-14 19:19:54 If oil goes to $100 as a result of a political clash between the US and KSA, and the US views KSA government as responsible, the US has enough instruments to ensure that number 3 doesn’t happen.
5958 2018-10-14 19:19:35 God bless the oil patch
5959 2018-10-14 19:19:30 yep had that at Goodman's Canary Wharf.
Bit dapper and the steaks,,,,
what next..I dunno...
5960 2018-10-14 19:19:25 The U.S. has for decades been way too close to the authoritarian Saudi regime.  First, it was primarily due to oil.

5961 2018-10-14 19:19:15 it is estimated that approximately 15.8% (268,824bpd) of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in. It is also estimated that approximately 8.9 percent of the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in.

5964 2018-10-14 19:18:58 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
5965 2018-10-14 19:18:53 Oil can just stayed all in back of my car & it stank 
5966 2018-10-14 19:18:41 I had one of biggest collection of online painting images fm best painters fm across the world (at least in pakistan ) will share time to time , few iranian painters are amazing ,steave hanks is master in oil paintings
5967 2018-10-14 19:18:39 I love coconut oil
5968 2018-10-14 19:18:37 Oil
Brent crude rose by US17 cents or 0.2% to US$80.43 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US37 cents or 0.5% to US$71.34 a barrel. Over the week Brent fell by US$2.29 or 2.8% and Nymex fell by US$1.91 or 2.6%.

5969 2018-10-14 19:18:33 coconut oil and finding a shampoo/conditioner that just works w ur hair and hydrate it better than it does stripping the oil out also blowdrying ur hair or straigtening it can make it feel softer but u def need an oil of some kind its kinda trial and error cos everyones different
5970 2018-10-14 19:18:25 Like any Canada-style trade deal is probably going to be predicated on you having massive oil reserves to barter with...for a start.
5971 2018-10-14 19:18:23 Shiiidddd I was there off the oil 
5972 2018-10-14 19:18:17 People may think the economy is improving. While their 401k's may be up, they are paying more for food, gas, heating oil, electricity, taxes and every day expenses. 41% may have drunk the kool aid but in the end it is the 1% who have gained and the rest are paying for it. @MSNBC
5973 2018-10-14 19:18:15 My hair gonna be SO long by the end of the month if I keep it wrapped up and keep using my Wild Growth Hair Oil underneath it everyday. I dont wanna comb it out or touch it until the day before my flight leaves
5974 2018-10-14 19:18:05 Best goal: Ramsay 
Best player: Monreal. Played every game. has put in top performances everytime he's been called upon.
Champagne moment: for me has to be the Oil goal against watford. The huge cheers of relief when the goal was scored and the celebration was superb.
5975 2018-10-14 19:18:04 Set your sights higher ... why not one of the fine and rare collection from Macallan courtesy of #ukog
5976 2018-10-14 19:17:59 U missing the point. Before 1975 the USD was not a reserve currency. It became so coz Saudis asked for oil payments to be setteled in USD only. China current holdings of USD will not differ. They will simply convert it to real estate holdings in USA instead of T Bills.
5977 2018-10-14 19:17:43 yes for now but we can reduce our huge dependency on oil for the good of our future generations
5978 2018-10-14 19:17:41 Yes, but I believe that as Facebook has become so much more than just a company, it is a platform really, it has responsibilities like all companies do, the same way we expext the oil companies to clean up spills for one, so does Facebook need to keep up with the free speech.
5979 2018-10-14 19:17:29 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.

5981 2018-10-14 19:17:25 Actually it's our oil/gas money.
5982 2018-10-14 19:17:23 Going to need to punt all the US corporate babies who backed his conquests, too.  Like Standard oil who gave him all the free oil he wanted.
5983 2018-10-14 19:17:16 Ya know what my favorite part of making gumbo is? When you're making the roux and you scrape some flour that's stuck on the bottom and the oil splashes up onto your finger.
Fucking gold.
5984 2018-10-14 19:17:15 i. trafficking water  live ! Tell them learn to float on backs! Dead b left at bottom of sea ! Evolve into oil ! But them getting de port ed !!!.Match day charges all genocide! Trafficking Americans live slavery! Kick that man out for steroid & gender identity abuse©®

5986 2018-10-14 19:16:59 Actually, if we pump 80% less oil, we get more income. #SupplyDemand
5987 2018-10-14 19:16:59 Too far from market, too low of price. And it needs to be extracted to produce high volumes of oil. 
Such a waste. 
If I ran the world, the mother of all nitrogen fertilizer plants would be built in the middle of the Bakken
5988 2018-10-14 19:16:55 "Oops, time to refill the oil." (Flame Man, MM&B CD Data)
5989 2018-10-14 19:16:47 Really love the look of the Chaos oil animation. 100/10
5990 2018-10-14 19:16:47 Just get a cleansing oil! I have a $2 bottle of almond oil I use, it takes off everything, and they’re better for ur skin than wipes or oil free makeup remover. You could google what oils are good for diff skin types, or just dm!
5991 2018-10-14 19:16:38 If Saudi-Arabia did that, a lot of other countries would increase their production, and after a short period of very high oil prices, it would start to decline pretty fast. Saudi-Arabia is completely dependent on that oil, if they don't sell, they lose everything.
5992 2018-10-14 19:16:38 Earlier:  RAGA had to retire with an engine issue.

Then EARN brought out the caution with a spin at the start-finish line.

Finally, MENA had to bail with a possible oil leak.

5994 2018-10-14 19:16:10 maybe. you just need dried lavender, like the loose leaf used for making herbal tea.  and your own little sachets or bags, probably lots of hacks online available for what you can use.  alternatively, lavender essential oil though you'd need more frequent application.
5995 2018-10-14 19:16:00 Oh right I knew they were exporting, I just figured this was some sort of sanctions thing.
Ultimately the single best thing we could do for national security is stop using oil.

1. Early week down
2. Latter part of the week up

Eur/Dollar
1. Rise closer to 1,167

US Dollar
1. Early week rise
2. Down closer to 94,60 $
5998 2018-10-14 19:15:43 I feel you. Winter is coming and sometimes my face gets dry which is weird but I’m happy to hear that you’ve used it before. Definitely get the oil skin kit.

6003 2018-10-14 19:15:25 Tell Saudi to kiss our ass! Open up our reserves President trump and drive the price of oil down until the cry!
6004 2018-10-14 19:15:20 I’ll accept high oil prices if it means the withering of Saudi power.
6005 2018-10-14 19:15:14 Noxzema, Black Soap, Aloe Vera Gel and Coconut Oil are essentials 
6006 2018-10-14 19:15:13 I keep hearing people rave about black seed oil, is it that good?
6007 2018-10-14 19:14:44 & I use coconut oil for workouts.
@RegalCourtier7 
Forgot that one.
6008 2018-10-14 19:14:33 Because certain politicians need those sweet, sweet oil dollars to fund their campaigns
6009 2018-10-14 19:14:31 @WilliamHnutsack hello williams greetings from spain you do not direct movies,you are retired I love the asses a lot of oil.
6010 2018-10-14 19:14:25 Was thinking more along the lines of selling oil in yuan to the Chinese
6011 2018-10-14 19:14:17 Hmmm....I think that overlooks the victory on the western front.  Germany's war machine required them to take Russia for the oil, and its a gamble they didn't win.  But the retaking of western Europe was a victory for western allies.  Still a huge sacrifice from Russia though 
6012 2018-10-14 19:14:08 Yes,it is...can you compare the oil facilities there to Escravos?
6013 2018-10-14 19:14:00 Sooo when you know people who install solar, wind, work for Tesla.. and you know pay their taxes... what’s that getting money from the government... do you know anything about what oil subsidies are?
6014 2018-10-14 19:14:00 Carr on flat tires oil leaking out of the rear main seal. Really?? Run for the first!
6015 2018-10-14 19:13:56 well ive always used tea tree oil and bio oil on any pop ups and that helps them go down, along with every night using apple cider vinegar as toner and aloe vera as moisturizer!

6017 2018-10-14 19:13:34 What an oil painting.
6018 2018-10-14 19:13:27 It's not rocket science... if Scotland pays more "oil tax" as we shall call it than England and all oil revenues are equally treated by HMRC then by pure deduction that means that Scotlands oil revenue is higher than England's. No need to number crunch, just common sense.
6019 2018-10-14 19:13:22 This gotta be the first time I got an oil change and they couldn’t come back and say they found something else wrong

6024 2018-10-14 19:12:47 We don't need your oil. We have our own. YOU are the one who needs us for weapons and training. Take Trump with you nd be gone from American lives. We are tired of you! Oh, get out of Yemen!

6030 2018-10-14 19:12:30  exactly that!! Slazenger numbers covered in oil, the lot!! 
6031 2018-10-14 19:12:29 We have gone back to gas guzzlers which we do every time gasoline prices fall. If no one buys oil, how long will the price remain $200 per barrel? You can't eat oil. See "Rollover" and "Three days of the condor."
6032 2018-10-14 19:12:28 I use fresh rosemary, parsley and thyme with pepper, Maldon salt, olive oil and either orange or lemon zest depending on my mood. I avoid garlic because I think it overwhelms the flavour of the lamb.

6035 2018-10-14 19:12:22 Ask Sweden.  They did a great job of it.  Their oil royalties aren't in the hands of a few private companies either.
6036 2018-10-14 19:12:20 Please tell Larz —
He has to understand the science & it’s consequences before he can “estimate” how bad we’re going to drown or fry. Also his comment is no defense for trump’s oil money.

6037 2018-10-14 19:12:13 Come someone go with me to get an oil change?

6039 2018-10-14 19:11:59 As for Iraq. No argument. Blair started an illegal war for oil.

The migrant wave came MUCH later.

Libya... Thank goodness we didn't get as involved as we could...

I shall repeat. According to the EU's own data. Six out of 10 migrants are actually economic migrants.

6041 2018-10-14 19:11:46 The government won't cut it's production to zero. They could either reduce it to make the prices go up, which of course Trump would hate that and would be bad for the elections. Or the Saudi gov would just switch to sell their oil in Chinese currency, China wants that so bad
6042 2018-10-14 19:11:36 Like i said before, I have no dog in this fight, couldnt care less about the UK staying together tbh. If Scotland can make it work alone I might even move up, I quite like Glasgow, I just dont see how you can. Oil that may or may not be there and/or accessible seems a bit flimsy
6043 2018-10-14 19:11:34 Oddly enough they’d much rather boycott Israel and Alberta oil.
6044 2018-10-14 19:11:30 Human rights go out the door when it comes to protecting our oil companies interests.

6051 2018-10-14 19:10:47 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6052 2018-10-14 19:10:43 There's silicone based lube for that. Not fuckin coconut oil
6053 2018-10-14 19:10:43 Lol. Set?

6061 2018-10-14 19:09:56 SA is are absolutly reckless, especially the new crown prince. Read the saudi state media "al arabya". they are on full attack mode against the whole world, they threaten with oil prices of 200 dollars and even an possible shift from us dollar to other currencies for oil.
6062 2018-10-14 19:09:51 Oil and gas or the past. Texas and America can lead In technology and innovation and clean energy and carbon mitigation, and save the planet and create millions of jobs. That is the future.
6063 2018-10-14 19:09:47 Exactly , the price of subsidies is insane in terms of innocent people lives lost in useless wars , pollution and so on . We know this huge subsidy exists not for average joe but for people owning the oil and refining it . What about subsidizing EV? A better planet is not good ?
6064 2018-10-14 19:09:38 Probably still better than the "vegetable oil" they sell in US.
6065 2018-10-14 19:09:35 Keep up the good work, Donald. Analysts say every rally erodes your base and causes voters to shift left. Thank you! Rally goers won’t carry the day, mainstream Republicans tired of the rhetoric and lies, finally seeing what a snake oil salesman our fake president really is.
6066 2018-10-14 19:09:30 What are the chances that I’ve been recommended olive oil and cotton wool plugs to nurse a blocked ear the same week Backstreet Boys perform at #strictly
6067 2018-10-14 19:09:24 I got peppermint oil in my eye. How’s your Sunday?
6068 2018-10-14 19:09:20 That’s irrelevant. It’s a supply/demand market, and we have more export supply than anyone else in the world. It only took 5% production increase to have oil to crash to $30 a few years ago.
6069 2018-10-14 19:09:20 We make more oil than we need now so who cares
6070 2018-10-14 19:09:17 M7 is owned by Sattar.. powerful director at STO during Yameen's days... he is also husband of Sana Mansoor who is the sister of Yameen's bff Lily Amir Mansoor and she used to be CFO of STO not to mention a director at Mocom used in 800m oil fraud.

Short answer..YAG athah govee
6071 2018-10-14 19:09:14 gonna need a pair of Wranglers and an oil filter, too, if you can swing if, my guy. Treat yourself to some of those marshmallow circus peanuts.
6072 2018-10-14 19:09:11 Hey, the Republican Party have their priorities; They are mostly funded by Big Oil. So if they acknowledged the 98.9% of scientists who are imploring the world to take action to mitigate the impending catastrophic effects of climate change, they would loose their funding, so...
6073 2018-10-14 19:09:07 Russia is a top net oil exporter, second only to Saudi Arabia.
6074 2018-10-14 19:09:07 Hey, you just ranted that our climate is FABULOUS!   How many visits to hurricane devastated areas do you need to visit BEFORE CO2 reduction is addressed to your oil company billionaires?  The Koch Brothers.. heavily invested in our earth’s destruction & we pay!
6075 2018-10-14 19:09:05 Baby oil ou Bi oil?
6076 2018-10-14 19:09:04 Only some of the places do that here..
Dealers will if its part of a package, else its charged extra.. 
chain oil change places dont even have lifts here they just go under the car so its extra work to change a tire..
Smaller places will often bundle everything though.
6077 2018-10-14 19:09:04 Jesus! Those Hamilton’s have seen some action!!!! Oil satin?
6078 2018-10-14 19:09:03 I’m so proud of myself for getting an oil change on a recommended basis cause I used to be that girl who would go 12,000 miles before I’d decide it was time to get an oil change.
6079 2018-10-14 19:09:02 I have 2 solutions actually
Capitalize on the growing global demand for fossil fuels, get our oil to foreign markets, use those revenues to simultaneously grown our fossil & green energy sectors while creating jobs in both industries & more tax revenues & spending.  Without taxes
6080 2018-10-14 19:08:54 The Saudi need our $ more than we need their blood oil.
American Energy Independence will solve many many problems.
Can't wait for you to take office!
6081 2018-10-14 19:08:43 Renewable energy, clean energy, mileage requirements, make oil worthless, all seems to still make sense
6082 2018-10-14 19:08:39 You're comparing oil to substances like mercury that have immense value when used properly and which are hazardous when consumed. Fair enough, but so what?
The ethical part comes from the countries where oil is produced: Canada v Saudi Arabia, not from the substance itself.
6083 2018-10-14 19:08:37 When I was in the US Trump have a big speech in Iowa about ethanol. I haven’t seen it mentioned much in U.K. media but increasing ethanol % in US fuel would have huge impact: would reduce reliance on foreign oil. Trump also set to liberalise CBD cannabis rules for medicine.
6084 2018-10-14 19:08:34 #SGDPlasticWorld Petrochemical Alternatives:
Petrochemicals are chemical products derived from petroleum. Most common petrochemical classes are olefins and aromatics; both produced by fluid catalytic cracking in Oil refineries.
6085 2018-10-14 19:08:29 They need our medicine, cars, technology, planes, arms, food, etc. Their economy isn’t going to survive as we phase out oil!

6087 2018-10-14 19:08:21 Then save yourself the hassle and don’t read the coverage of oil reporters. And honestly this conversation is not really helping anyone .
6088 2018-10-14 19:08:06 Many Nigerians are complaining saying that President Buhari has turn a prosperous century in a poor country. The question I want to ask is where were they when a barrel of oil was sold for $180 barre?
6089 2018-10-14 19:07:57 that's just soo far from the truth. Cheap oil has been terrible for the US. We need to end this awful relationship yesterday!!

6093 2018-10-14 19:07:29 They should, but every time I turn around and someone finds out I have chronic pain. The first thing out of their mouth is I should smoke weed or use CBD oil.
6094 2018-10-14 19:07:21 Oil is already indirectly heavily subsidized. The wars in Middle East also costed trillions of dollars. Behind all this was the core aim of securing oil to the west. Subsidies on EVs are a mere fraction of what was spent to ensure we burn cheap gasoline in our ICE vehicles.
6095 2018-10-14 19:07:17 7) Russia might enjoy the high price for a while. But Russia cannot enjoy the emergence of various Islamic movement or radical Islamic groups orchestrated by Saudi Arabia in the central Asian countries. Sp is the case of the USA & the EU. High price of oil or gas would cause huge
6096 2018-10-14 19:07:17 that's a load of crap. Cheap oil has been ruinous to our economy. We'll be so much better off the day we stop aligning ourselves with terrorists states for the sake of cheap oil
6097 2018-10-14 19:07:17 I can’t even try that thing anymore, I’d rub oil on my hands and still wear nylon

6101 2018-10-14 19:07:10 Lol. Imagine you now remove our oil exports. Laughable something.

6103 2018-10-14 19:07:10 How come the Canadian economy has grown more in 3 years under Trudeau than it did in 10 years under Harper? And why did the Canadian economy lag well behind the US and Europe after 2008? It’s because Harper was a slave to big oil and completely corrupt. #phoney #bye
6104 2018-10-14 19:07:01 I’m fully convinced that Watson soaks his hands in oil before grabbing the football. Dude cannot hold onto the ball to save his life. My gosh.
6105 2018-10-14 19:06:58 People must kick politicians asking oil price cut. At this point of time, this level of price has no harm towards the growth of country.
6106 2018-10-14 19:06:55 Does that leave the other four percent for the oil cartels?

6108 2018-10-14 19:06:44 Houmous made with anything but olive oil is not houmous. IMO.
6109 2018-10-14 19:06:42 Jimmy Carter tried to get us off the oil teat in the 70s, promoted solar back then, but Republicans scrapped efforts it when Reagan came in.
6110 2018-10-14 19:06:41 Whichever measures benefit him the most. When Iran oil, backed by Russian money, is exploding in the global market suddenly there is a reason to sanction KoSA? How long before we find Kushner has oil interests in Russia/Iran/Turkey? Cmon this is a set up.
6111 2018-10-14 19:06:39 I’m in bed at 8pm on a Sunday night watching Peaky Blinders with vitamin E oil all over my face. big wholesome energy, this is gonna be a good week
6112 2018-10-14 19:06:38 So little chance of Jill and Shula plunging into a vat of boiling oil. Oh well.
6113 2018-10-14 19:06:31 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.
6114 2018-10-14 19:06:29 You are quite delusional. If climate change isn’t addressed there will be no planet left to get oil from. Our future & the future of generations to come are depending on us. It’s possible to reverse course if addressed but maybe you’re old and don’t give a damn about the future.

6119 2018-10-14 19:06:11 Which allies? Pretty much all of them are major oil suppliers. 

I guess one downside of a Saudi retaliatory cut would be that the resulting boost in prices would help Iran. But that would also be part of the point - undermine US policy as punishment.
6120 2018-10-14 19:06:06 Cruz reliance on oil money assures Texans of a polluted coast line, roads collapsing from water and oil trucks due to fracking, polluted air, future mass shootings due to lack of background checks. Great legacy to our children and grandchildren.

6124 2018-10-14 19:05:50 "Our" pipelines? You don't own them

Oh wait....You're a PAC funded by foreign oil companies so yes you do own them I guess.
6125 2018-10-14 19:05:50 You cant have pipeline. Just accept it and move on. I literally dont care if Alberta has an economy if it is based on the oil patch.
6126 2018-10-14 19:05:39 Do we even know who dropped him off? The street is very narrow. Unlikely that you could park right in front. Diplo security usually don't let strange vehicles park near a diplo facility for fear of VBIED's. Don't forget Erdogan wants Mecca and all the oil.
6127 2018-10-14 19:05:37 This is true. In the last quarter century proven global oil reserves has risen. There is no scarcity. And the China Petro trade is over: Chinese demand YoY has dropped each of the last 3 years. China leading toward other fuel alternatives.

6129 2018-10-14 19:05:31 I hate when the msm makes a mistake and misleads the good people of this country they get distracted from what is happening! It is all about rich getting richer. It is collecting your tax $$ and oil...thank me later
6130 2018-10-14 19:05:25 Not even remotely true. I believe in a multi-token future, but I also know that snake oil and incompetence is always rooted out eventually.
6131 2018-10-14 19:05:23 I got motor oil on my favorite jacket yesterday, and now its permanently stained.

How do I convince my boss that I need time off for bereavement?
6132 2018-10-14 19:05:23 Threats behi the scenes,, the turkish economy is in absolut  crisis mode (look at the currency  troubles). If this crisis gets worse, erdogan will lose the next election. Its all about money. Look at todays threats out  of SA towards the US (high oil prices, dollar).
6133 2018-10-14 19:05:22 Why?  Because Michael McFaul IS RIGHT.

We have plenty of our own oil.  We have plenty of REAL allies that can sell us oil (Canada, Norway, Mexico, etc.).

We should not support murderous dictators.
6134 2018-10-14 19:05:18 and Eddie....you dedicate all your success to Heid ?
Behind every good man is a good woman. 
6135 2018-10-14 19:05:17 Interesting thought. World price for Brent Crude Oil is over $80.00/barrel but Canada still only gets $28.75/ barrel because we don’t have pipelines to tide waters. The US is only 2 years away from being self sufficient with their own oil reserves. Then what happens to Canada?
6136 2018-10-14 19:05:16 كفو عمتو.

6139 2018-10-14 19:05:00 #Saudi_Arabia 
I think you need to listen to what was mentioned by Turki Aldakhil wisely and carefully.  Because any action against Saudi Arabia will escalate the crude oil  prices easily to more than 200 USD per barrel. Billions of investments and thousands of jobs will be lost.

If DT’s goal remains 2 look 4 any excuse 2 lift RU sanctions so ROSNEFT oil can flow (2 Putin’s great delight), might this latest dust-up w/Saudi Arabia serve as a convenient pretense 2 lift US-led Int’l sanctions, as an alternative oil source 4 EU?

6146 2018-10-14 19:04:29 We sell oil to China & India (and Ukraine I think) Then import oil from Saudi Arabia, among others. We import our oil while what is drilled or mostly fracked these days on our soil is sold off. We don’t refine it. We buy expensive oil from Saudi Arabia. Repeat.
6147 2018-10-14 19:04:18 6) Weakened or are on the verge of total collapse or have collapsed, we would face another dangerous story. This unpleasant combination can pose threat to both friend & foe in different terms. As an example, in case of an oil & gas interruption by Saudi Arabia, a country like

6150 2018-10-14 19:04:05 Not relevant! If supply in oil markets go down, prices for all (and US consumers) go up no matter what is US market share.

6157 2018-10-14 19:03:41 Next time you sit down to eat a meal, try to picture how each item got there. Picture the vegetables growing on the vine, the oil being extracted from the olives, the cow grazing in pasture. You’ll experience mind-blowing gratitude.
6158 2018-10-14 19:03:40 The US has been protecting them for way too long. Its a shame just because US is a profiteer of the oil and selling weapons they protect all the attrocities and terror this state is committing to Yemen and Qatar. Shame.
6159 2018-10-14 19:03:38 I think you should be the one to debate @Nouriel and hot oil wrestle each other as well.

6177 2018-10-14 19:01:50 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sends its message to the world. We are not the country that is under threat. We do not accept extortion. We are not the state that sanctions are imposed. You are the one who needs us. We are the biggest source of oil and the biggest who controls OPEC
6178 2018-10-14 19:01:44 Just hope the rumour of the Saudi Royal Family wanting to buy the rags is not true, maybe ok for laughing at them retracting the 'oil money' quotes but the Middle East are shrewd businessmen

6180 2018-10-14 19:01:27 So while we might like to punish the Saudis for this, will the president be willing to accept the economic pain? Would he instead sacrifice his key foreign policy objective? Can’t do both.

The fact that oil markets and the Saudis play a role in that calculus is not ideal.
6181 2018-10-14 19:01:26 We are no longer dependent on Saudi Oil! Screw those guys and their empty threats! #JusticeForKhashoggi

6183 2018-10-14 19:01:24 Wonder who got all the oil from Iraq...think folks mostly look the other way
6184 2018-10-14 19:01:07 Thank you Trump. Get into a fight with the Saudis and keep oil prices high as long as possible. That'll do more good than tax credits. Pinch the American everyday for buying an ICE car.
6185 2018-10-14 19:00:43 Still writing fiction.
6186 2018-10-14 19:00:43 Oh look, imagine we had an Admin that was investing in alternative fuels. A totalitarian regime might not be able to hold oil prices over our heads 
6187 2018-10-14 19:00:31 Oh jeebus... And they're saying now that they'll retaliate against sanctions cos their money is too important to the global economy... Aren't they actually in great debt and the oil is all smoke and mirrors...

6189 2018-10-14 19:00:25 We dried it out over night between kitchen paper, then seasoned it with oil, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano and lemon pepper. Then oven roast for 20 mins. Then the batter is equal parts flour and milk with paprika and salt and lemon pepper again (just a tab)
6190 2018-10-14 19:00:24 What happens to USD if Saudi, Russia, & Iran start swapping CNH for gold (sourced fr London, NYC) in HK?  Compare phys oil production of those 3 to vault holdings in London/NYC.

6193 2018-10-14 19:00:14 Most probably , the US government is allied with the Saudis for the longest even knowing that they fund every terrorist organization, as long as they are getting oil and money everything is ok in their eyes
6194 2018-10-14 19:00:12 And? If KSA wants to cut oil production, then they are responsible.
6195 2018-10-14 18:59:56 So I told my friend I want my edges to be fuller and her ass told me try olive oil and monistat every other day for 2 weeks...

Why are you all debating 'Carbon Tax'  and not paying attention to the destruction of a Canadian Industry by  'Big Oil America'  !???!
6200 2018-10-14 18:59:30 Lol! I’m not saying what I’d like to see, just what I think might happen given today’s clowns in DC and my memories of living in “oil crisis” America in the late 1970s.
6201 2018-10-14 18:59:23 Shithole state & only existing because of Western oil interests
6202 2018-10-14 18:59:23 Yes, admittedly shale oil does have an effect as does refineries being put off line but not nearly enough to disrupt the price that badly, the demand isn’t there when your main partner can wait you out.
6203 2018-10-14 18:59:19 How my space case ass has remembered to get an oil change on time and not have my engine blow up on me yet. Truly uncharacteristic behavior

6206 2018-10-14 18:58:57 You’re just being loud & ignoring reality. If we cannot sustain our economy, we perish. That isn’t dramatic it is plain fact. No other industry is even close to replacing oil to float our economy. You’re shortsightedness is a demonstration of why you’re not fit for your position.
6207 2018-10-14 18:58:52 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
6208 2018-10-14 18:58:52 I am lebanese and no of course he will say this nothing new amd thats why we no goverment yet  .. threats and counter threats and ksa will obey eventually . Oil will be pushed up then sell the hell out if it ..
6209 2018-10-14 18:58:49 Matt, can you come to Canada and help get our dumbass govt to sock more of our oil wealth away? It would be legitimately tragic if oil went to $200/barrel with current status quo. They’d just lower income taxes and introduce means-tested pharmacare and call it a win.
6210 2018-10-14 18:58:45 But wouldn’t high oil prices actually be good for the oil industry in the US and actually maybe give coal the boost it needs?   Screws the rest of the population but hey if you own Exxon Mobile stock you should do well
6211 2018-10-14 18:58:44 @marcorubio I get it.Ur a tough guy but u better weigh everything before jumping on S Arabia. Granted if guilty there should be repercussions. But remember u go too far & who steps in(Russia,Iran )Oil goes up. So please be smart & not 2 macho. Please don't go w/but we are America

6215 2018-10-14 18:58:33 Not always... not any more that every other Politicians in our history, that's for sure. Who cares if his number are a little off, at least he isn't saying "No new taxes" then raising our taxes and starting a 30+ years oil crisis that we will fix.
6216 2018-10-14 18:58:30 Likely he will give an impassioned speech about global warning and then vote to outlaw renewable energy and promote big oil.
6217 2018-10-14 18:58:29 Rude
6218 2018-10-14 18:58:24 I absolutely agree on oil industry. In case you misunderstand me, I'm more of "just tax gas $5/gal & use the money to improve public transit" kind of guy. No artificial subsidy. No public support, though. I just think there are better ways than expensive long-range EVs.
6219 2018-10-14 18:58:24 Damnnnnn , i need my oil changed

6221 2018-10-14 18:58:17 Having imposed a sugar tax, will the government now impose a meat tax to slow climate change and a palm oil tax while you're at it.

6224 2018-10-14 18:57:55 Will he try that again? All though the price of oil was cheep it made western nations want to become more energy independent and drove many into the arms of renewable! The oil economy is to unstable if a small group of countries can crash western economies overnight!

6227 2018-10-14 18:57:26 Again that is the UK establishment opposition to Scottish independence but mainly for military and oil reasons. Without any sense of acrimony, I sympathise with Scottish independence even if I have little time for the SNP.
6228 2018-10-14 18:57:23 Then I suppose that Norway should lead by example and stop crude oil and natural gas extraction ?

6232 2018-10-14 18:57:09 In fact, the current dynamics are a perfect illustration of the true problem of oil dependence as it relates to foreign policy.

The US is right in the midst of trying to execute a particular foreign policy action - Iran sanctions. Because markets are tight, we need Saudi supply.
6233 2018-10-14 18:57:03 “Think oil. Whatever that means to you.” The first quote of many from today’s MFA rehearsal
6234 2018-10-14 18:57:02 Well that's a load of crap, all oil and gas revenue in the U.K. Is liable to tax. Tax figures are very much available to the public... you are just trying to get me to do your work 
6235 2018-10-14 18:57:02 Just give #BIAFRAREFERENDUM and we shall see what matters. Oil is a #RESOURCE - look what those crooks did with it in last Century fritter away to improve other people's lives (I'm not talking Africa here)...Useless politician who kills own people. I wouldn't want him,oil or not
6236 2018-10-14 18:56:54 Just imagine if saudi arabia sale their oil with their currency SR instead of dollars!, what migh happen to the dollar!!
6237 2018-10-14 18:56:46 Put down the crack pipe... 
SA's GDP is about the same as Ohio's.  And the US has Crude up the ass right now, they don't need theirs.  
Also, try converting the CNY from Oil on scale, unless you want to keep it all and just go shopping in Guangzhou for the rest of your life.

6252 2018-10-14 18:55:43 Just caught up with the result of the Scotland vs Portugal fitba game. Very sorry, fellow Scots - but this sport is like a national resource, we have no oil back home and so there is no plan B. Portugal has got to be good at it, whereas Scots can focus on better things  #SCOPOR
6253 2018-10-14 18:55:38 A transwoman tweeter, appalled by the acrimony being generated, has said: "Transwomen are male; but we're not men" recognising sex and gender not at all the same thing. Also said about women's refuges: "Do we REALLY have to be there?" It felt to me like oil on troubled waters.

6256 2018-10-14 18:55:21 Yes.  Also, while the environmental costs may be high, let’s resume fracking and crash the price of oil again and see how they like it when their cash cow disappears.
6257 2018-10-14 18:55:18 All of LA is littered w oil wells and there’s very little access relatively speaking on which are properly capped or still active or what... and I know you’ll be shocked, but so many of them are in Black and Brown working-class neighborhoods.

6259 2018-10-14 18:55:04 Oil change is easy. I figured it out on YouTube.
6260 2018-10-14 18:54:56 I think whether the oil weapon is overplayed is really a function of what people mean by it.

But in this case, I would certainly argue that Saudi Arabia has some considerable leverage over the US because of oil markets.
6261 2018-10-14 18:54:52 Agreed there are many ways Saudi Arabia could strike back, but selling oil for $CNY is not practical for host of reasons. I would argue too that $USD debt is #1 commodity traded. Swamps oil by magnitudes. Capital is a commodity too.

6269 2018-10-14 18:54:09 If the palm oil demand decreases they will just switch to a different tree/oil. Same thing happens with maple syrup, forests chopped down, elk and bears habitats displaced. There are many products like that so we shouldnt single palm oil out. Palm oil is vegan imo

6295 2018-10-14 18:51:30 the Saudi regime can  not use the oil as a weapon this is well known and the regime is a functional system he plays the role which is required of it. otherwise, it will collapse within a few days or maybe within 12 hours as the guarantor and  protector said

6305 2018-10-14 18:50:44 Let me guess ……. @realDonaldTrump's anticipating that his source of #Saudi oil is about to dry up 
6306 2018-10-14 18:50:32 Rising oil prices will only encourage more production elsewhere. It will also allow American companies to make more money. Further, it will speed transition to electric vehicles and alternative energy. I hope the prices do go up. Long term, this is bad for KSA.
6307 2018-10-14 18:50:30 Didn't go through the article but barrels of crude oil are well known cause impacting global economy . 
6308 2018-10-14 18:50:30 Look, I’m going to vote for her. Clearly McSally is a lunatic. But I will roll my eyes as I do it because Sinema is a snake oil salesman. #InMyFeelings
6309 2018-10-14 18:50:27 
Normalizing (religion) oppression in the name acceptance and political correctness is like arguing that water and oil mix well...they don't. Doing it for profit is just as bad.
6310 2018-10-14 18:50:24 Very good strategy but they’re nuts if they think they could drive it up. The only way oil price goes up that high is Donald goes to war with them
6311 2018-10-14 18:50:20 we did enjoy ourselves, and this is indeed a very fine olive oil, thank you. i think you'll get used to the ring :)
6312 2018-10-14 18:50:13 Coconut oil is literally life changing for you hair
6313 2018-10-14 18:50:12 And so too, will the renewables & alternatives, pay billions in royalties once they replace “most” oil & gas. Time to retire your horses & catch up to the new world. I say “most” because I’m for oil & gas, but with less prolific waste of it.
6314 2018-10-14 18:50:10 Try Omega oil vitamins for depression
6315 2018-10-14 18:50:06 I made three trips to Saudi back in the 90's, and was shocked at the lack of individual freedom. But I understood the power of oil and oil money. The human rights commitment of the USA has never applied to Saudi Arabia, doesn't matter if the GOP or Dems control the Whitehouse.
6316 2018-10-14 18:50:05 Is Trump going to take responsibility when the economy tanks after oil hits $200 a barrel?
6317 2018-10-14 18:49:49 So because he threatens countries that stand up to him everybody is going to ignore he deliberately had a journalist tortured & killed to shut him up?Canada had the balls to take his retaliation because it stood up to him ,they’re are other countries to get oil from

6321 2018-10-14 18:49:38 We were fine with Canadian oil. Trump fuc@ed that up.
6322 2018-10-14 18:49:37 oil at.. right around $300 is when the consumers start feeling the burn   At least the saudis are starting with $200    oil at $200 is pretty casual
6323 2018-10-14 18:49:34 Baby oil or Vaseline
6324 2018-10-14 18:49:26 The U.S. could easily cover Saudi oil imports to Canada.  That’s a fact.
6325 2018-10-14 18:49:26 All I want is to try some hot chocolate but can we just go the easy route & buy premade? NOPE bc every brand including @LoveGhirardelli & @Walmart brand have to go & add coconut oil, or sugar or some other form to their recipes. I give up. It is like the world wants me to starve.
6326 2018-10-14 18:49:24 Initial gut feeling for #election2020 - #Democrats ticket should be @BernieSanders and @SenWarren 

but it'll more likely be @JoeBiden and @BernieSanders if we can get past the 'really old white men' concerns.

You won't get oil or mid-Am. But you'll get AARP & pharma/insurance
6327 2018-10-14 18:49:16 Cooking oil 
6328 2018-10-14 18:49:15 Remember these are the guys who caused the price of oil to drop to $40 per barrel! Thousand of oilfield worker's jobs evaporated overnight. Ironically oilfield workers tend to vote Conservative, & that stunt caused Alberta tar sands oil to be to expensive to produce!
6329 2018-10-14 18:49:14 Government had been providing subsidies to oil since the beginning
6330 2018-10-14 18:49:13 Guinea-Conakry is richly endowed with natural ressources. It possesses the world 1 half of the world reserves of bauxite, over 4 billion tons of high grade iron ore, significant gold and diamond reserves along with undetermined uranium and oil reserves. #investinguinea #investors
6331 2018-10-14 18:49:12 Only his own. With Russia he has no choice. Owned/Kompromat. NK is Russia's ally. SA has an oil deal with Russia, and SA is padding Trump's pockets.
6332 2018-10-14 18:49:11 Just mix coconut oil in your fav bottle(s) of lotion, slather it on your body, and you’re good
6333 2018-10-14 18:49:07 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
6334 2018-10-14 18:49:00 You did it, you're criminals, and you offer the world nothing besides oil, which is on it's way out.
6335 2018-10-14 18:48:59 Saudi Response: how much? Just name your amount!
If not, then we will raise oil prices to 100 or even $200.

No need to panic guys
6339 2018-10-14 18:48:42 In talking with people at AMLO rallies – including people not owning cars – they seemed to think: Mexico produces oil so that oil should be refined into gasoline (in Mexico) and that gasoline should be sold cheap
6340 2018-10-14 18:48:35  #trade_oil_by_yuan
6341 2018-10-14 18:48:31 No they bleed oil stupid
6342 2018-10-14 18:48:30 Crude oil accounts for 95% of Nigeria's foreign exports.
6343 2018-10-14 18:48:25 @Tzeporah you accept funding from those who would topple Alberta’s oil industry and spot non specific unproductive platitudes, while pandering to Albertans disingenuously. So please we are all ears what shall provide for Albertans when we abandon oil?
6344 2018-10-14 18:48:22 no more bowing, kissing the hand, enough. the kingdom has made it's people subservient to a crown. in a modern world oil is not enough to legitimize the hypocrisy that surrounds this family. wealth comes w/responsibility and the house of saud shows none. it is the 21st century
6345 2018-10-14 18:48:21 I got spun out the first prelim night in September then knocked a hole in the oil pan and was buried in the points already. Duck River was 5.5 hours away, 15g to win and 5g to run 4th. It seemed like the smarter option to try and make a living
6346 2018-10-14 18:48:16 So it turns out the oil cap in my car has a pretty important job to do, apparently.
6347 2018-10-14 18:48:07 As Saudi Arabia threatens to raise oil prices, gotta ask once again, why arent we like completely on alternative energy already?
6348 2018-10-14 18:48:02 Agreed! The narrative changed dramatically over the week-end. We were in a cosy slope (I was planning a WTI -5% to -10% before rebuilding my oil portfolio just before Nov.4). Now we have to account for this massive geopolitical risk. Cannot wait to see how Australia reopens... ?
6349 2018-10-14 18:47:58 @saudiarabia in cahoots with @realdonaldtrump @potus through @whitehouse in some fake dialogue over some false sanctions about a journalist purposely killed to go to war just to up oil prices. But hey treat women & ltbg like shit! !!

We wouldn’t need to be held hostage by countries like Saudi Arabia. But then, this is what happens when big oil calls the shots.
6353 2018-10-14 18:47:04 寿命縮んじゃう。。。。。。
6354 2018-10-14 18:46:56 Amazed at all the people that blame Trump for high oil prices because of Iran.. and then simultaneously demand action on Saudi.  Playing both sides of the fence x1000.  #oott
6355 2018-10-14 18:46:55 It doesn't necessarily matter bec either way the world runs out of oil eventually. Pretending the effects of its use won't be a problem ignores the inevitability of restructuring the world's economy when there isn't enough. It's accepting chaos, because prob we'll die first.
6356 2018-10-14 18:46:35 How much oil or any other goods do we actually import from them, directly. Don’t think it’s that much.
6357 2018-10-14 18:46:30 It has taken Hazard 5 years and over 5 coaches, the oil is just coming out now in trickle drops. So guy take the chillest of pills on that.
6358 2018-10-14 18:46:27 ..and fourthly how to attract more FDIs and FIIs in India in the wake of oil crisis. These are the crux points which should be taken into mind of global oil crisis.
6359 2018-10-14 18:46:22 iirc an olive tree produces just so much oil per season. If there are more olives on the tree, there is less oil per olive. That's the reason olive trees are periodically heavily pruned. Having a larger crop of olives does not mean more oil.
6360 2018-10-14 18:46:17 OPEC countries artificially controlling oil prices so you will have to pay more at the pump. Goes right in their pockets.
6361 2018-10-14 18:46:15 And again, what part of #climatechange do you not get? Burning fossil fuels only exacerbates the situation. We need to transition out of our fossil fuel economy - building more oil supply is going backwards!
6362 2018-10-14 18:46:06 I hope @realDonaldTrump doesn't think he's going to get a deal on Canadian oil when his Middle East sources dry up …. after the way he's treated our PM and slagged our Minister of Foreign affairs during the NAFTA negotiations. But hey, he still has #Putin and Russia 
6363 2018-10-14 18:46:05 Regime change must take place nit only in Iran but also in oil rich countries, immediately.
6364 2018-10-14 18:45:54 Well, maybe just maybe, 100 million won’t mean much in 20 yrs if there is no planet left. I, for one, am very concerned. Before you tell me to fuck off , I have a son working in the oil fields who is now getting very little work.  Doesn’t mean both sides don’t have a point.
6365 2018-10-14 18:45:43 First US&UK need to create that vacuum in Riyadh. 
Does JK incident hit decibel as much as Iraq WMD?!
World situation quite different from 2003.

US aggression on Iran has already made oil costly.
With Saudi..?!!

However, Saudi even talking any US in this line is quite a change.
6366 2018-10-14 18:45:39 We drill more oil than the Saudis 
6367 2018-10-14 18:45:28 えっちじゃん
6368 2018-10-14 18:45:26 If my President, @realDonaldTrump, caves to Saudi Arabia, I call on all my fellow #MAGA & #Deplorables to tell him it's bullshit & unacceptable. Those assholes brought down the towers by teaching that Wahabbism shit to their angry youth. I'd rather buy oil from the Iranians, TBH.

6370 2018-10-14 18:45:19 Dear House of Saud: The US has been a net exporter of oil since 2014. You murdering fucks can fend for yourselves when the Iranians come for you. Come to think of it, it wasn’t the Iranians that did 9/11. That was you! We’re obviously on the wrong side.
6371 2018-10-14 18:45:07  Hey friends!

6372 2018-10-14 18:44:55 If Alaskans all had clean energy, their super cheap to free energy would exceed the benefit of those oil royalty check. We have 71 rooftop solar panels, & our electric bill for an entire year was $300, saving us $10,000.
6373 2018-10-14 18:44:53 so its for energy security then? stop relying upon oil Putin for gas? 
I honestly can't understand the logic give the potential environmental damage both in terms of carbon emissions (plus methane) and risk to the watercourse.

6381 2018-10-14 18:44:13 firstly there must be a discussion on depreciation of Indian rupee in terms of vehicle currency i.e. dollar which gives impact on oil prices. secondly there must be a parity between the central tax and state tax on oil. thirdly how to curb the current account deficit for India..

6387 2018-10-14 18:43:12 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
6388 2018-10-14 18:43:09 Garlic, red onion and chilli in the pan with a little oil. Really cool that until red onion changes colour. Then add harder veg. Then softer veg. E.g. broccoli stalks need longer to cook than heads. Bean sprouts next. Lastly noodles. Don’t cook them for too long. Sauce last 1/2
6389 2018-10-14 18:43:05 It was fine until the US sanctioned it because of oil revenues, thanks.
6390 2018-10-14 18:42:56 Shale oil extraction is a way more effective way to stabilize the price though. Replacing the grid takes a long time, probably decades with the $70billion/yr you'd raise from your tax.

6418 2018-10-14 18:41:03 @realDonaldTrump if you want to teach Saudis a lesson, than just start with policies to move our country to a renewable energy economy and make oil the fuel of past century. Help create employment and innovation towards clean energy at scale by 2020, transition coal miners first.
6419 2018-10-14 18:40:56 The oil patch would of course be delighted. So would the growing EV industry and renewables. The rest of the economy not so much but would resist. Especially if it could clearly blame a third party. And the oil demand destruction would be a sight to behold.
6420 2018-10-14 18:40:54 You can’t protect the environment by buying a pipeline for dirty oil!

6430 2018-10-14 18:40:02 I usually have to put oil in my hair while its wet and then blow dry it and straighten it with a flat iron and put the comb on below the flat iron so its getting combed before it gets straightened.

6432 2018-10-14 18:39:51 What TF is Saudi Arabia going to do? Not sell its oil? Not buy weapons from US, Canada, and EU so it can co tinue bombing Yemen into oblivion?
6433 2018-10-14 18:39:51 10 yr rates actually went down last week, mkt doesnt believe there is a trade war, and higher oil - well that's so BS manipulated as we all know that well.....

WHY the moronic S&P did that HUGE re-allocation during BLACK OUT PERIOD right before earnings is a DISGRACE.
6434 2018-10-14 18:39:44 its 42 days of worldwide oil supply and 169 days of worldwide gas supply. in other words, its a drop in the bucket.
6435 2018-10-14 18:39:40 Here is a theme, 2:37 and the Bowling Green @walmart still can get oil changes done.  Booked for the day, yet again. Pathetic.  5 trips over two month, weekday, weekend, same line, same excuse. #wasteoftime

6439 2018-10-14 18:39:32 That being said, I’m not sure KSA is eager to be receiving yuan for their oil either. We are likely to get empty threats from both sides here.
6440 2018-10-14 18:39:30 Also, it's not really about coconut oil vs animal fat. More about coco oil vs other traditional cooking oils, which arent usually animal fats.
6441 2018-10-14 18:39:30 China’s capital account is wide open thru physical gold, but only London & NYC.  There’s a lot more oil in Saudi than there is gold in London & NYC.  What happens to the USD if “oil bids for gold”?
6442 2018-10-14 18:39:23 Perfect time to reflect that our current Congressman @RepRohrabacher wants to have oil rigs right off our Newport coastline. Please consider voting for @HarleyRouda on Nov. 6th instead. He is pro-business, pro-environment and will protect our waterways & beaches.
6443 2018-10-14 18:39:21 I’m an adult now because I’ve gotten two oil changes without my dad reminding me 
6444 2018-10-14 18:39:21 Beautiful! Oil on paper? I’ve been revisiting Arches oil paper and starting to like it.
6445 2018-10-14 18:39:17 That oil >>>
6446 2018-10-14 18:39:13 Hair done, nails done, eyebrows snatched, car oil changed and tires rotated today has been productive! 
6447 2018-10-14 18:39:07 Lol. We no longer need Saudi oil. They know it and they are the petrified ones. Give us a reason to nuke your country as settlement for 9/11.
We have not forgotten.
6448 2018-10-14 18:39:05 Is Bill Nelson running for re-election this November? If so where I can donate to make sure @FLGovScott never never got a public political position. He is colluded with big oil corps to deny Climate Change.
6449 2018-10-14 18:39:05 Bro. I ain't going to deny what you're saying.

But thing is that if Saudi Arabia today stop producing oil barrels then the world will literally stop because no other country has the capability to produce this much to compensate.

Fact is, currently, no one can produce this much.
6450 2018-10-14 18:38:59 Lol so it's not going to phase out oil. Why aren't you following the conversation.  Hahaha
6451 2018-10-14 18:38:57 @realDonaldTrump has used his lack of tact to anger the Saudis who can cut off the supply of oil coming from there or just raise their prices.  Trump has also antagonized China with trade tariffs and by sending a fleet of US warships to the S. China Sea just off of China. 
6452 2018-10-14 18:38:49 I hope Joe Biden runs then we’ll know all about his dirty secrets! Like his sons HUGE Ukraine oil deal and those creepy YouTube videos
6453 2018-10-14 18:38:40 If they are ballsy enough to do this, it would hurt them. Riyadh is completely dependent on oil to finance their bloated public sector and free-social services. Without $ rolling in, all of this becomes tough to sustain. Plus, as @AndrwPMiller said, KSA would lose market share.
6454 2018-10-14 18:38:37 You ask a different question and you get a different answer. Oil companies are notoriously reluctant to admit their total reserves. But even according to your list Scotland (or UK) has five times as much as the second and third European countries (Romania and Italy)
6455 2018-10-14 18:38:33 In others words, Trump should read the UN report and stop opening up national parks and monuments to oil & gas. Especially as renewables produce more American jobs!! Win-win for USA.
6456 2018-10-14 18:38:33 Helicopter: noun. A million parts rapidly rotating around an oil leak waiting for metal fatigue to set in
6457 2018-10-14 18:38:20 What if Saudi Arabia started selling oil in the Chinese yen instead of dollar? What would happen to the  US dollar?
6458 2018-10-14 18:38:13 Saudi little secret is they don't have the oil to be swing producer after 40 years of intense exploration w almost zero success. The 6 Super Giant fields that produce 85% of Saudi oil have an average age of over 50 years old. Most have water problems that showed up decades ago.

6464 2018-10-14 18:37:26 Capitalism and democracy mix about as good as oil and water.

6466 2018-10-14 18:37:12 We don't even break 10% in SA oil consumption. The whole idea is to stay friendly with a terrorist nation so they'll continue to buy weapons from us.
6467 2018-10-14 18:37:07 If the USA had focused on renewable energy back in the early 70s when OPEC was formed we wouldn't be in any of the messes we are in. War over oil, global warming. All so oil companies and arms dealers can continue to get wealthy.

6471 2018-10-14 18:36:45 You know it’s cold when your coconut oil is so solid that it crumbs
6472 2018-10-14 18:36:45 If you go to Carotino's website it appears they pay for research into the " health" benefits of Red Palm Oil. Hmmm.
6473 2018-10-14 18:36:44 today, I've made you a country fusion baguette sticky bun with olive oil.
6474 2018-10-14 18:36:33 Actually, Mexico is the top exporter of oil to the US...and we've all witnessed what the administration does towards that huge trading partner.

6479 2018-10-14 18:36:12 Tinubu had a rich background and not like Atiku :

"Tinubu worked for the American companies ArthurAndersen, Deloitte, Haskins, & Sells, and GTE Services Corp. After returning to Nig in 1983, Bola Tinubu joined Mobil Oil Nigeria, and later became an executive of the company."
6480 2018-10-14 18:36:11 She was put on that board at the behest of the oil companies, not the NDP.

6482 2018-10-14 18:36:04 Trump ain't beating drums for no reason.. check his UN speach complaining for rising oil prices
6483 2018-10-14 18:36:00 Always remember to the change the oil in your time machine once every 6 months or 3,000 years.
6484 2018-10-14 18:35:57 Caught #Wildlife at @bfi #lff today. Great performances all round and beautifully shot - so many scenes looked like they could have been an oil painting. Very nice of Paul Dano to drop in on us too

6490 2018-10-14 18:35:28 The moment he gets a job lobbying for Big Oil...
6491 2018-10-14 18:35:21 Would absolutely love to see ruling Saudis taken down by their own arrogance and greed. If that takes down some of US Senate/Congress, GOP/Dem, I’m fine with that.  Oil has to go the way of coal if humans want to continue living.
6492 2018-10-14 18:35:14 I've seen conflicting advice about using tea tree oil on piercing bumps but it's worked so well for me on two different piercings.
6493 2018-10-14 18:35:02  @Ataa_Oko chaley engine oil dey her veins ooo but don't stop shooting wae
6494 2018-10-14 18:34:59 Banks are again making big money off of oil commodities.
My opinion is that is the reason prices at the pump continue to rise. Revenues so far in 2018 have surpassed the whole year last yr.
6495 2018-10-14 18:34:53 I wonder if there’s a cbd oil for my bank account...
6496 2018-10-14 18:34:49 did you lose your virgini- virgin olive oil
6497 2018-10-14 18:34:46 He probably burnt some midnight oil on the floor of his spectacular closet with his sewing machine.  Kind of disappointed tho that he stopped short of bedazzling it

6499 2018-10-14 18:34:42 those are real possibilities yeah. Doing it on purpose for the right reasons might minimize some of that impact. But however we get the world off oil, not doing it will definitely be worse.
6500 2018-10-14 18:34:42 Partially but higher interest rates, trade wars and higher oil DID have a bit to do with it with record long margin debt all one way ...
6501 2018-10-14 18:34:41 I believe you’re understating the facts here,the implications of Saudi oil production cut will be devastating to the global economy & other countries wont rely on US. Also the financial market will be severely impacted which will eventually impact oil companies and production
6502 2018-10-14 18:34:40 Big ears Rubio's position is, well we probably can't make a difference, so let's just say the hell with it. Live for today and keep pumping the profits of big oil, utilities and dirty industries. The message of no-hope, so let's party like its 1999.
6503 2018-10-14 18:34:15 My washing machine died, and had to be repaired, so I have a severe back log of laundry. Sigh. So I added some Marijuana coconut oil and some Kahlua to my coffee to make laundry fun, instead of inspiring suicidal thoughts like it usually does.
6504 2018-10-14 18:34:08 my best recommendation is the best shampoo for dandruff (dries the hair and gets rid of any dirt/oil) and your preferred conditioner + hair mask to make it smooth
6505 2018-10-14 18:34:06 If you don’t pay the bills of Halliburton and Schlumberger or any engineer they stop work. A bus driver, a Soldier and their assorted friends are not the best people to run an oil company , obviously.
6506 2018-10-14 18:33:52 Without the oil, prepare your self to raid a hoers
6507 2018-10-14 18:33:51 No wayyyy are u 44 
You must bathe & shower in Oil of Ulay  X
6508 2018-10-14 18:33:43 Exactly! Well put.

And we could still have something for everyone, including heavy identity politics versions for people who like that.

Comic franchises & their creation should just be free expression for all tastes, and spaces for all the “oil & water” can coexist peacefully.
6509 2018-10-14 18:33:40 , I'd be surprised if they were not here.  Everyone that I know is very similar to us in values when it comes to assisting.    I hope all those nay sayers against oil remembers this !!
All without power, welcome to life without oil in so many ways!
6510 2018-10-14 18:33:33 Well, come on bitches.....I mean witches.  At this point, I'll take potions, hexes and curses.  I'm presently shopping for a chicken, eggs and canphor oil to work on spell.

6526 2018-10-14 18:32:29 Think of how obtuse politicians like @marcorubio & his ilk are being when denying humanity FREE ENERGY. Would the transition be hard? Damn straight. Would a new industry take the place of big oil? Yes. Jobs jobs jobs. The problem is big oil pay Rubio to deny #climatechange.
6527 2018-10-14 18:32:24 #SaudiArabia is not a country, it is a barbaric desert prison created by the British empire to control the penisulas oil on behalf of the super rich.

6530 2018-10-14 18:32:09 We should all be getting off the grid and making changes to be less oil dependent. I’ve been working on growing my online side hustle for years and i was finally able to quit my job, which means no more commuting. Grow your own food, work on getting off the grid

Only thing that would top it would be an Alice photo bomb. 
6539 2018-10-14 18:30:59 The United States uses Saudi Arabia as a hedge against Iran.
The question should be why do we need a hedge against Iran at this point in the #MiddleEast?
We don't need the oil & we sure don't need to be in the middle of #sectarian conflicts.
Time for a new US Middle East policy.
6540 2018-10-14 18:30:58 Check out Dermalogica. Their products are amazing. My face gets oily and I’ve been using it for about a month.  my face feels purify and refined + my face is always glowing & helps control oil production and minimize congestion. They have different types of kits for any problem
6541 2018-10-14 18:30:49 Oil and gas companies and govts created the problem and any taxes or funds to rectify the condition should be paid for by those responsible. The public have paid taxes plus VAT for hydrocarbons for decades and they had no choice
6542 2018-10-14 18:30:39 I’m not a dr but my stepmoms lil cousin had brain cancer and she tried to use canabis oil for treatment and she started getting better right away. She was blind and paralyzed, but taking cannabis oil helped her to see and move again. You just have to have a strict alkaline diet.
6543 2018-10-14 18:30:30 It's not a left/right issue.  I've met with plenty of conservative Republicans about it. What they say off camera is different than on camera. The oil industry knew about it since the 1960s, they just didn't think it would come on so quickly.

6548 2018-10-14 18:30:14 They've already prepared for a world that will leave oil behind which this article which is 5 years old doesn't account for. It's outdated.
6549 2018-10-14 18:30:11 I also like frying my spices in oil in the pot.  It’s called “blooming”.   Then adding tomato paste to the spices and do the same thing.  Add the cooked ground beef and everything else.  It’s a good cheat.

6559 2018-10-14 18:29:28 Canada’s already lost billions of investment money due to this train of thought. Investment is happening elsewhere until this government and their theories are gone- long gone. We already hold very high standards for oil exploration but that’s leaving the country
6560 2018-10-14 18:29:26 You can put tea tree oil on them and it’ll make them go away

6568 2018-10-14 18:28:57 Well, my hypothesis is that, in part, he's hanging Berman around the neck of the oil sands companies. Remember, they supported the carbon tax etc. He's weaponizing OSAG as a reminder to the CEOs to stay out of the politics and not to defend their buddy Notley.
6569 2018-10-14 18:28:45 Saudi arabia finally has been exposed to the world with their dark mentality. As a muslim i feel saden by the fact that it is the  home of the most holy places in islam. This dark mentality and powered by oil money has given the birth to extrimism and terror .
6570 2018-10-14 18:28:45 This feels like through the keyhole in our house 
6571 2018-10-14 18:28:36 I get all my LDL cholesterol from Osetra Caviar...best fish oil capsules on Earth.
6572 2018-10-14 18:28:33 KSA Independence Day. Compete with USA. VLCC just now...sure. Become darling of Arab Street and make peace with Israel and try fix Palestinian issue with oil money. #KSA 
Bad for USD and UST for a long time.

6574 2018-10-14 18:28:28 Die werken echt goed & inderdaad hot oil treatments maar gewoon niet teveel producten en maskers liefst alles natuurlijk want je haar kan ook uitgeput geraken daardoor en gewoon zoveel mogelijk hitte vermijden en moest je echt stijlen of krullen heatprotector gebruiken

6579 2018-10-14 18:28:13 PSA: Coconut oil is an A1 makeup remover
6580 2018-10-14 18:28:11 और साथ ही साथ डीजल की खपत कम होने से Crude Oil Import Bill भी काफी मात्रा में घटेगा,

6581 2018-10-14 18:28:07 Yup yup need some oil money
6582 2018-10-14 18:27:54 U need to educate urselve more about productions of oil, you will find that ur poor car is can not be made without oil. Bty, those ppl you disrespected  them can get ur economy down in two hours. Lol
6583 2018-10-14 18:27:51 Check your girlfriend's oil right now. Ain't nothin but dust and bats in it.
6584 2018-10-14 18:27:42 I use Veet, but my skin gets irritated sometimes so I apply coconut oil
6585 2018-10-14 18:27:35 Put baby oil in it. You’ll feel it in there. Put a cotton ball, lightly, to keep it in your ear. If that doesn’t work,you’ll need to call the Dr. this is a momism.
6586 2018-10-14 18:27:26 So...oil spills are good for us & wildlife?
6587 2018-10-14 18:27:23 Our existing oil industry has paid the way for many in royalties and Corp taxes. Busted farmers alone who would not be able to compete will shut it down.
6588 2018-10-14 18:27:16 I went in for my tire rotation appointment and homeboy at the dealership hooked it up with a free oil change 
6589 2018-10-14 18:27:15 最近寒い。。。アロンソくん欲しい。。。。。。
6590 2018-10-14 18:27:09 Correct. Oil and gas production on federal lands actually fell about 20% under Obama. All the gains in production were on private and state land.
6591 2018-10-14 18:27:06 Wait wait wait WHAT ?!! Coconut oil isn’t good for you?

6600 2018-10-14 18:26:19 Our Galileo thermometer just broke and now we’re inhailing harmful paraffin oil that is also flammable... great!!
6601 2018-10-14 18:26:17 Well done
6602 2018-10-14 18:26:10 They need an essential oil called “hangover” for your diffuser
6603 2018-10-14 18:26:08 Which makes not giving up a 7th for him all the more perplexing. At this stage, the roster move is secondary.

6605 2018-10-14 18:26:02 Could be that increased enforcement along the border going after every illegal alien has resulted in less attempts to smuggle in these areas. Beside that, smuggling people is highly profitable with little investment, they get caught, you already got paid.
6606 2018-10-14 18:25:50 THIS IS HOW SUPERVILLAINS GET CREATED!

6609 2018-10-14 18:25:46 Saudia Arabia trying to bully America with oil prices.
6610 2018-10-14 18:25:45 Plastics lobby, oil lobby, gun lobby, all connected , to the 1%. Waiting on the Constitutional Convention so they can shut us all up.
6611 2018-10-14 18:25:40 The only way they are going is a big offer from an oil rich country or the Chinese. No European or American will get close. Pretty sure it’s a load of rubbish.
6612 2018-10-14 18:25:39 I don't think they are threatening oil production so much as providing compromising information on Trump or Kushner. Trump started equivocating out of the gate on the news about 'if true'. Saudis are brazen because they have the goods on our corrupt Dear Leader.
6613 2018-10-14 18:25:28 Wrong.  Start more local oil production and cut them off completely
6614 2018-10-14 18:25:26 It’s not the 70s. The US gets very little of its oil from Saudi Arabia
6615 2018-10-14 18:25:25 Oil, coal and gas companies are a problem but they are not the top culprit. It is the animal agriculture business.
6616 2018-10-14 18:25:23 And that's not an application where oil is abundantly used. So again it's not going to phase out oil.
6617 2018-10-14 18:25:21 Ed, you need to get closer to the fire and dump the bloody candles.  Happy Birthday to You

-Drink a lot of water 
6619 2018-10-14 18:25:09 You put it succinctly! We agree, The world is currently on a knife edge and the black swan may just have appeared in a certain embassy. It's quite possible that the next war uses oil price as a weapon. It might be that the next financial crisis finishes things. Interesting times.
6620 2018-10-14 18:25:07 アロンソくん好きすぎてごめん
6621 2018-10-14 18:25:05 $200 a barrel oil? Sounds like just the push the world needs to get off oil.
6622 2018-10-14 18:24:53 Today Congress is crying petrol petrol. But they did not pay much attention towards oil exploration.
6623 2018-10-14 18:24:52 I use tea tree oil. Just a little under my nose. A little on my chest if I’m congested
6624 2018-10-14 18:24:42 I’ve been seeing a lot of tweets about not getting oil changes but when’s the last time y’all got new tires
6625 2018-10-14 18:24:42 It’s true. 

Seeing as Iran is currently under heavy U.S. sanctions & their oil has been [technically] taken off the market, Saudi Arabia has been covering that shortage. 

An angry & irrational Saudi Arabia, could potentially cut production and subsequently drive up oil prices.
6626 2018-10-14 18:24:39 We've been known they were shady. But they're also a big oil producer and super rich. And have influence in the peninsula. Guess no one wants to piss them off.
6627 2018-10-14 18:24:39 No be small money wlh
6628 2018-10-14 18:24:35 F Them, lets be friends with civilized folks. You know, Canadians, our #1 Country for oil.
6629 2018-10-14 18:24:32 Certainly still out there. KSA issued their own statement , which contains threatened retaliation. Oil not specifically mentioned , but well - they really don’t have to say the “O” word.

6631 2018-10-14 18:24:22 それ僕にとっては日常茶飯事みたいです（なって。。。）
6632 2018-10-14 18:24:11 Ahh, yeah I could see somebody else on that list making a claim. Dano won’t clear, that’s for sure, but Winnipeg isn’t expecting him to. Jets are giving him an exit opportunity and dropping a contract in process. Dano finds new home by this time tomorrow.
6633 2018-10-14 18:24:10 Well he did... don’t you remember all those oil train derailments?
6634 2018-10-14 18:24:02 I'm playing around with oil in bread and am impressed by the results, especially in flatbreads.
6635 2018-10-14 18:24:01 Where did I say that? I said calling oil ethical is like calling a turd a brown golden nugget. It's a title meant to purposefully deceive. 

But hey, with that ability to invent meaning for others, I can see why you have such a robust following.
6636 2018-10-14 18:23:51 This seems about something other than an environmental risk to students. If the ground below the high school is “littered with abandoned oil wells and saturated with methane gas and oil" as subway opponents claim, why are your kids in that building?
6637 2018-10-14 18:23:44 #Saudi_Arabia 
1) Hundreds millions of muslims are supporting Saudi Arabia

2) Any action against Saudi Arabia will escalate the crude oil prices easily to more than 200 USD per barrel

3) Billions of investments and thousands of jobs will be lost.

So don't ever think about it!
6638 2018-10-14 18:23:42 Exactly haha. That thing probably hasn't seen a new oil filter since like '08
6639 2018-10-14 18:23:38 Man, my sister’s pumpkin pie is the best, topped with Cool Whip (an edible oil product!).
6640 2018-10-14 18:23:29 Yes well need oil drilling off the Florida coast. Lots of NG and oil there to help offset the spike in cost due to Rubios ignorance
6641 2018-10-14 18:23:28 Black Seed Oil.
6642 2018-10-14 18:23:24 the color of quality olive oil
6643 2018-10-14 18:23:22 So let’s just pick an alternative .. Wind energy .. So how many 100’s of barrels of oil does it take to make 1 Wind turbine? Also doesn’t the altering of wind patterns and velocity have a measurable adverse effect on the surrounding eco system? Ex. Birds, wind blown seeds, ....
6644 2018-10-14 18:23:14 And the U.S.refuses to pay world prices for Canadian oil.
6645 2018-10-14 18:23:13 It pisses me off !
6646 2018-10-14 18:23:06 *ARAMCO* if you talking about Saudi oil company. They are vulnerable now and Trump will seize the opportunity to squeeze more petrol dollars. Like he said, it isn't wise(business) to terminate the over 200 dollars worth deal. I fully agree with Satchu MBS no longer tenable.
6647 2018-10-14 18:23:04 Saudi and US will become natural competitors and cooperate where beneficial. Saudi will be dramatic and win over Region(Sans Iran..) and make Peace with Israel and use oil money to try and fix Palestinian issue. #KSAID #IndependenceDay #KSA #History

6650 2018-10-14 18:22:55 Oil and salt scrub, then more oil
6651 2018-10-14 18:22:41 There are precisely two reasons we maintain favorable relations with Saudi.

1) Oil
2) We prefer their form of terrorism over Iran's.
6652 2018-10-14 18:22:08 Thank you! So many self-preservation reasons not to engage with this online, but then you finally think ‘oh crap, time to oil th’unused armour’s rust’. Or at least I do.
6653 2018-10-14 18:22:04 Lol. You're opponent. @ScottWallacePA has spent his career combating climate change. You get big $$$ from big oil. You gave ExxonMobil a 6 billion dollar tax break.  #FitzpatrickTwoStep #VoteFitzOut
6654 2018-10-14 18:21:58 Sainsbury's, Tesco, Lidl: no spreads that aren't loaded with palm oil. Does anyone know any spreads (other than butter) that aren't?
6655 2018-10-14 18:21:56 Bc those native populations live near closed/ planned uranium mines that @SecretaryZinke wants to open up

I mean what are he &@FEMA_Brock going to do w/ nuclear parts shipped to montana &no uranium?

Uranium is why we stay in Afghanistan 

Why didnt we take the oil?
Uranium...

6657 2018-10-14 18:21:48 Oil markets today are not the sane as in 1973. Demand for oil could become more elastic rather quickly with a big shock. Such a move would push aside 2030 plans. It is a lose lose. They know that.
6658 2018-10-14 18:21:47 We lose also because withe rising oil costs comes a decrease in the global demand for dollars (via the OPEC deal). We'd experience slight inflation.
6659 2018-10-14 18:21:31 @plaza_tire I went in Friday to get the "Smart Driver Package" with oil change, wiper blades, and tire rotation etc. at Scott City, Missouri Plaza Tire Service and my tires were not rotated, my breaks obviously were not checked, nor was anything done except blades and oil.
6660 2018-10-14 18:21:22 This could leave us using fossil fuels much more threatening to the climate than  Saudi oil as well
6661 2018-10-14 18:21:21 38 to the garage after power/oil pressure issues.

6664 2018-10-14 18:21:06 They make nothing but oil
6665 2018-10-14 18:21:05 Ok so caster oil works soooooooo well for lash and brow growth everything is so thick and dark rn
6666 2018-10-14 18:21:05 Of course he does go to America has an interest in the saudi, s because they buy weapons and have oil and own a large part of the american stock market
6667 2018-10-14 18:21:04 My dude, “ethical oil” about as real a thing as unicorn oil. You should try getting votes with actual ideas and plans. BTW, what’s your plan? #ClimateActionNow #ClimateChangeIsReal
6668 2018-10-14 18:21:00 #Venezuela's oil production fell 42,000 bpd in September, putting output below 1.2 million bpd. There are no positive signs. Venezuela's 25 operating #oil rigs are the lowest the country's had in 30 years. Collapsed infrastructure is just another consequence of #socialism.
6669 2018-10-14 18:20:52 No. 38 of Ragan still off the pace on the backstretch. Loss of power, low oil pressure. Making a hard turn to the garage. #NASCAR
6670 2018-10-14 18:20:49 The people who change my oil remembered me and I don't know if that's because I look distinctive or if my car is exceptionally shitty orrrrr
6671 2018-10-14 18:20:44 Then again I don't really ever drain the oil considering the Landy just burns it
6672 2018-10-14 18:20:44 What exactly are you driving at? You mean if any APC member commit an offence, Buhari should be blamed.... Right?
6673 2018-10-14 18:20:42 This Tamanu oil is soooooooooooo AMAZING!!!
6674 2018-10-14 18:20:40 They have to talk tough to save face. Turkey will get concessions to keep bug evidence quiet.  We need saudis to keep Iran in check. Behind the scenes we ll get oil price reduction and publicly talk tough.  Prince was plain stupid but we re not going to ruin for a non citizen
6675 2018-10-14 18:20:25 I’m sure conservative politicians said the same things about the whale oil and the horse and buggy businesses. They’re always short sighted.
6676 2018-10-14 18:20:24 Plants eat organic animal matter to produce too, the plastic comes from the oil that is made from fossil animals. Nothing is really vegan
6677 2018-10-14 18:20:20 Thinking about checking the oil and battery of my old Tumblr and taking it out of the garage pretty soon.
6678 2018-10-14 18:20:10 A whole new chapter!  Keep away from the edge
6679 2018-10-14 18:20:08 I am in the oil industry. I’m not reading through BP’s material but I can tell you that their claim that emissions went down is not compelling in the face of increased production and Trump’s coal policy if I understand your point correctly. They have an agenda. #cdnpoli
6680 2018-10-14 18:20:08 Water, small dabs, ice pack on head or hot towel on face. If you have, peppermint oil under your nose and on temples or tigers balm. Feel better 
6681 2018-10-14 18:20:02 and that was due to Obama lifting restrictions on oil production back in 2015. So no you can't give Trump credit for that.
6682 2018-10-14 18:19:51 There should be an essential oil that cures the pain of unreciprocated love.

Sounds messed up but it works for preventing a cold when you start to feel it & shortening the length of a cold.
Also good for upset belly apparently but I haven’t tried it for that.

6690 2018-10-13 23:59:32 Does it just say that the US and Russia continued the Cold War via proxy over oil and then just list the factions like team lineups?

6692 2018-10-13 23:59:15 It's not just this province, or country. It's a common trend globally.

The wealth influencing politics is coming from the same people. Oil, coal, media, tobacco, etc. Spreading hate, using globalization to divide people and blame people in "out groups" instead of them (corps).

6709 2018-10-13 23:59:32 Does it just say that the US and Russia continued the Cold War via proxy over oil and then just list the factions like team lineups?

6711 2018-10-13 23:59:15 It's not just this province, or country. It's a common trend globally.

The wealth influencing politics is coming from the same people. Oil, coal, media, tobacco, etc. Spreading hate, using globalization to divide people and blame people in "out groups" instead of them (corps).
6712 2018-10-13 23:59:03 keep the kisses, baby oil on pussy is a no.
6713 2018-10-13 23:59:02 Coconut oil also clogs your pores, just to let you know. Lol.

6720 2018-10-13 23:58:04 Friend, what Arab Spring? When Obama supported overthrow of Mubarak for Morsi, invited Muslim Brotherhood to WH, backed Erdogan at every turn, while abandoning the Green movement in Iran. Saudis have ZERO power to project. What they do have is Oil & Mecca, a blessing & a curse

6724 2018-10-13 23:57:44 This is a lot of hot bullshit! That is NOT how this works! Saudi's can't sell their oil to Russia! We have FAR more power than @realDonaldTrump wants US to know. He has placed self interest above US interest! Get this piece of conflicted garbage OUT of the WH!
6725 2018-10-13 23:57:29 Need some fish oil
6726 2018-10-13 23:57:24 @WhiteHouse I'm Very Serious About Oil Being Sold At A High Price. They Don't Pay. Then A World Wide Oil Embargo. For Years. See My Powers.
6727 2018-10-13 23:57:20 5-1 in the unwashed pucker up puig shirt. the 1 loss came on the day i had to spot wash an oil stain. i swear no water or soap will touch this shirt again
6728 2018-10-13 23:57:04 I bet it’s a gas burn off point for like an oil well
6729 2018-10-13 23:56:57 It hurts to look at some of my basses and realize they need some fresh strings and a good oil. If only our strings were as cheap as normal guitarists haha
6730 2018-10-13 23:56:50 Apparently, it also optimizes for subsidized coal in China and subsidized oil in Venezuela, so that's a problem.

6733 2018-10-13 23:56:31 Petry Oil is back unfortunately.
6734 2018-10-13 23:56:06 The school has a cancer causing oil derick on the campus. The school has been sued for it. 
It’s not about health and safety.

6737 2018-10-13 23:55:16 The US guaranteed to use its military to protect the Saudi oil. Kissinger/OPEC/Gold Standard? Ringing a bell. The US needs everyone to keep trading oil in the $US. Lybia was going to change that and what happened. China and Russia are threatening. PetroYuan. Look out.

6743 2018-10-13 23:54:33 I didn't realize Harold was on corporate welfare. I figured he was still over-pumping & under-reporting oil & selling on the side (i.e., stealing from the lease holders). That's how he got his start on his billions when he was a grease monkey working with my dad.
6744 2018-10-13 23:54:19 How is our economy not shrinking now. $20/brl oil sounds pretty shrunk to me.

6749 2018-10-13 23:53:58 Worth noting that, even though is it unlikely that it’s a reaction to T since you’ve been on it a while, you can develop an allergic reaction to most things at any point in life. Including peanuts, which Sustanon is usually in peanut oil.

I recommend mentioning it to your GP.
6750 2018-10-13 23:53:51 Congratulations, great job
6751 2018-10-13 23:53:47 Stay unconscious during the worst time. My pain develops from the time I'm awake. It's like Charlie horses develop in my hips, inside & out, during waking hours it gets worse, hits 10 about 8-9 pm now. It used to be, 24/7 of  sitting in boiling oil, couldn't do anything! Up, Up
6752 2018-10-13 23:53:36 In the middle of the mound ain’t nobody got the oil spill
6753 2018-10-13 23:53:14 How much does it cost to sell a $20 barrel of Alberta oil? $40?
6754 2018-10-13 23:53:02 I’m guessing you just douse it in oil and fry it then 
6755 2018-10-13 23:52:59 Youtube Brotherhood 100 Year Plan how to conquer America. This is why so much hate from Left. Its stealth invasion funded by oil $$
6756 2018-10-13 23:52:56 If you really think oil companies and organizations are comparable to agricultural farming when it comes to which is worse for climate change your completely wrong and need to get educated before you spout incorrect solutions. The onky way to see progress is by going vegan.
6757 2018-10-13 23:52:25 Why not just mix in some vanilla essential oil instead and skip the mess?
6758 2018-10-13 23:52:17 @j66anderson since she looks like she needs some body work now you think it will be converted to an @TeamChevy truck for next season?
6759 2018-10-13 23:52:15 Wrong, Canada has spent almost $20 billion on Saudi oil in the last 10 years.
6760 2018-10-13 23:52:06 Great job my man!
6761 2018-10-13 23:52:01 Great pint of neck oil this evening #welldone
6762 2018-10-13 23:52:00 Oil, tobacco and weapons- all in the same sentence? A natural, biodegradable substance we require,   an addictive substance that will kill you, and a product designed to kill others. Even on Sesame Street it would be simple to see which one is not like the others.
6763 2018-10-13 23:51:34 This is despicable, and you know it. @gop @VA_GOP 
You can't win on ideas and policy. So you resort to lies, voter suppression, and fear to keep "power" We The People are done with you. You are dinosaurs. But take solace in being dinosaurs. Eventually you will turn into oil - lol
6764 2018-10-13 23:51:27 EXCEPT FOR OIL, because the US has ignored becoming energy independent water, wind, solar, magnets etc) for decades while our politicians have become wealthy taking money from large oil corporations.

Otherwise the US does not NEED Saudi Arabia for anything.
6765 2018-10-13 23:51:17 @lord_mchaggis We have the oil #ScareTheEnglishIn4Words
6766 2018-10-13 23:51:17 do you know what happens after death? 

nothing , you turn into oil and we use you to generate power
6767 2018-10-13 23:51:14 Build the pipelines! The global economy runs on oil! That isn’t going to change in a hurry. You want to buy or oil from the Saudi‘s or from Venezuela? The oilsands respect workers and have stringent regulations.
6768 2018-10-13 23:51:08 Play the same game, turn him in fo oil spills from his equipment. And make him pay u restitution for dumping that water on you then damning it off! Make the government make him clean the water mess he put on u by daming off the water he sluces on u

6774 2018-10-13 23:49:33 Great job
6775 2018-10-13 23:49:29 Great job. Keep up the good work

6777 2018-10-13 23:49:23 The sun only looks hot! Really the heat comes from the earth! The more coal and oil we dig out of it, the more it will cool! #gopLies
6778 2018-10-13 23:49:21 oh!イル
6779 2018-10-13 23:49:19 I am always disgusted by our country’s indifference to Saudi behavior because of oil and money.
6780 2018-10-13 23:49:17 Coconut oil on its skin, also, start giving it a little bit of wet food and buy yeast pills and crush them and put them into its wet food, yeast pills make their skin taste bad to the fleas so they’ll try to avoid it. The corn starch suffocates them and makes them jump off
6781 2018-10-13 23:49:03 Sustainable energy and problem is literally solved . If there weren’t old world oil and coal barons producing their garbage electricity this wouldn’t even be an issue . the greenies playing into this fuds hands should instead be pushing for sustainable energy
6782 2018-10-13 23:48:58 Huge comeback by the Dodgers and one can't help but wonder if Counsell outsmarted himself in taking out Miley when he did. Was cruising along & likely had another inning or two to give. Brewers will need some of their starters to give them length or that bullpen won't last.
6783 2018-10-13 23:48:55 I keep thinking about combining my beard oil with some Madagascar Vanilla extract. Who wouldn't want to be that appealing, right? I would be all over someone who smelled strongly of vanilla.

Sadly, it contains sugar, so I'd have a disgusting, sticky beard.

... worth it???
6784 2018-10-13 23:48:52 I remember using this anointing oil to cook and my mum took me for deliverance 
6785 2018-10-13 23:48:50 Been at @NTB for more than three fucking hours for a general oil change. U would think they’d do better considering they’re also more expensive than other places. Very disappointing and we’re definitely not coming back. Worst place to get an oil change ever.
6786 2018-10-13 23:48:47 girl: ooh i like your lipgloss
me: ah thank you hahaha

it was actually oil from the mcmuffin that i ate earlier but thanks???
6787 2018-10-13 23:48:40 My pussy pretty too , soap & baby oil & you good
6788 2018-10-13 23:48:40 I cowash instead of shampooing. I only shampoo once a month. On completely wet hair a apply a leave-in, after some type of curling creme/moisturizer, next I use an oil (wild growth is what I’ve been using lately). Then I finish with miss Jessie’s soft curl jelly.
6789 2018-10-13 23:48:38 I had beet tops + noodles for supper I added a bit of sesame seed oil + it came out nice with a little bacony flare to it... kind of like the gold panning day's can't wait to get back into it.
6790 2018-10-13 23:48:34 They sell TENS units at grocery stores and pharmacies. Electro stimulation therapy. You can also try a hot epsom salt bath. Magnesium will sometimes help me with stressed muscles that are spasming. Also FWIW CBD oil is supposed to help with spasms.
6791 2018-10-13 23:48:28 My neighbor just knocked on my door and asked me to borrow some vegetable oil. First of all we don't have that shit in my crib  secondly... how tf do you borrow vegetable oil?

6793 2018-10-13 23:48:13 Saudi makes more money on Hajj than oil. But hopefully the sanctions will piss them off some more.
6794 2018-10-13 23:48:08 HAIR CARE TIP  ....... Fill a spray bottle with H2O, Aloe Vera Gel & Lavender Oil 
6795 2018-10-13 23:48:07 So good!!! I put hot oil too 
6796 2018-10-13 23:48:02 use the baby oil one it worked good i swear. i’m never shaving again
6797 2018-10-13 23:47:57 We have plenty of oil. We sell it!
6798 2018-10-13 23:47:49 We find out who put that oil down we gone fight
6799 2018-10-13 23:47:49 Oil price is only one factor. Demand is up and supply is down due to refinery fires and hurricane in the gulf.
6800 2018-10-13 23:47:41 Ummm this old man just paid for my oil change 
6801 2018-10-13 23:47:40 canada could go %100 green overnight - it would still be a fart in the air - this ideology is killing canadas economic engine(alberta) - while we could make billions on oil right now and invest those billions back into a green economy. our kids will blame you #ndp #alberta
6802 2018-10-13 23:47:35 Has anybody called on the UK to stop buying oil from Russia after it killed a former spy who resides in the UK? Isn’t that the same standard that the left immediately is requiring of Trump regarding SA?
6803 2018-10-13 23:47:34 Road trips sober is HELL. Happy  I’m on this oil
6804 2018-10-13 23:47:32 Ughhhh....oh no....that image 
I'm no oil painting myself....but I do have standards
6805 2018-10-13 23:47:19 I do thanks - But you can keep the warm oil.
6806 2018-10-13 23:47:15 あ、でも交換の人先に会えるかきいてみよう
6807 2018-10-13 23:47:05 So is @tenthavenorth going to wait to go on stage since the Oil Palace can’t figure out parking? We’ve gone .2 miles in 45 minutes
6808 2018-10-13 23:47:04 Are there any alternatives to coconut oil that you guys use for your skin??

I’m allergic & I’d like to find something, besides lotion, that I can use before it gets cold...
6809 2018-10-13 23:46:52 All I want is tuna and toasted pita chips comfy pjs movies lit candles with my oil diffuser going  perfect night
6810 2018-10-13 23:46:42 I want some massage oil that doubles as lube so I can really have fun with alpha this weekend. Which of you #cucks is buying it for me?

@ShrunkBoy @maxgeorge100 @mike_mashall @RT4D1 @rtserf @RT_Pig @RTFindomPromo @FemdomDaily @DommeDaily
6811 2018-10-13 23:46:30 Not 100% correct. The new pipeline, line 2, would take the diluted bitumen to export leaving room on existing line 1 to ship only refined products plus light oil to the Burnaby refinery increasing gasoline supply in Vancouver, thus lowering the price.
6812 2018-10-13 23:46:28 A little damage is ok.  You guys and 002 did awesome today.
6813 2018-10-13 23:46:27 I swear I was a pigeon in my past life
I crave bread all the time
At work I ate a French baguette
Toasted in the oven with olive oil and then I drizzled some balsamic glaze 
6814 2018-10-13 23:46:24 I just want to give him an oil treatment
6815 2018-10-13 23:46:23 Ridiculous! We simply cannot extract all the oil from the tar sands and every climate scientist on Earth knows this.
6816 2018-10-13 23:46:06 hey Jordan! Are you guys planning on running Toyotas again for the Plate Races in 2019 or are you gonna run Chevys?

Me after watching a Master paint in oil paints: I want to paint in oil paints
6819 2018-10-13 23:45:16 @HOBOrlando massively disappointed tonight at the HoB Orlando. We have previously enjoyed Taco's and Sweet Potato as Gluten-free and Fish free as my wife has allergies. Now however the BBQ sauce has anchovies and the Sweet Potato is cooked in oil with Gluten foods #nodinner
6820 2018-10-13 23:45:14 The Oil is Scottish #ScareTheEnglishIn4Words
6821 2018-10-13 23:45:00 They didn't. Suddenly one journo disappears & the world cares? After years of unfettered abuses, the Global community now cares taking KoSA in hand? Iran, and Russia's oil investment are behind this.
6822 2018-10-13 23:44:51 Is attempting to cook bacon and eggs-

But the oil keeps jumping into his cuts-

Or.. well gashes.

Blood flavoured bacon babyyyyy
6823 2018-10-13 23:44:07 Congrats on another top 10 finish in a wild race today! Job well done!
6824 2018-10-13 23:44:05 Whatever snake oil salesman.
6825 2018-10-13 23:43:42 Yeah I know. It’s almost like the companies are trying to make back the losses of giving the oil away to the USA. We need a better more unified national energy strategy, one that doesn’t involve more tax and deterring business investment.
6826 2018-10-13 23:43:33 Rex Tillerson was the SOS. Exxon has a profit share with the country- let’s not pretend Trump is the only scumbag. Any financial contribution from API, Exxon or any oil organization essentially comes from the House Of Saudi
6827 2018-10-13 23:43:27 It is OUR business - Because if the Saudi's want to do BUSINESS with us they WILL answer for what WE SEE as human rights abuses! Seems like the country will soon be over a barrel! If the West pulls out of doing business including purchasing OIL well I guess your fucked!
6828 2018-10-13 23:43:26 He's never stood up for Alberta before. Jason Kenney - the Ottawa insider - never fixed equalization to benefit Alberta & he cost the Canadian Oil patch $35B by cancelling income trusts. Jason has never stood up for Alberta, he's only worked for The Conservative Party of Canada.
6829 2018-10-13 23:43:24 I havent had Oil Down in years
6830 2018-10-13 23:43:20 We don't get oil from there. 
6831 2018-10-13 23:42:40 So is Angola also able to produce energy security as they are currently producing more oil than Nigeria now.
We have a ridiculous deficit of infrastructure all over the country. The amount mentioned is not enough to solve Energy as we require 80,000MW to cover the country.
6832 2018-10-13 23:42:40 Great run, you guys deserve it.
6833 2018-10-13 23:42:36 That's why we still need to gather as many information as possible, besides you need to also check our income from oil produce in the last 3 years(it's the lowest period recorded). Also check the revenue generated from none oil resources such as agriculture etc
6834 2018-10-13 23:42:36 Just stay away from the facist fish oil capsules, good buddy! 
6835 2018-10-13 23:42:20 Looks like that trucks getting a bowtie!
6836 2018-10-13 23:42:18 coconut oil spray does wonders for hair 
6837 2018-10-13 23:42:17 Lotion or baby oil
6838 2018-10-13 23:42:15 One place uses algae oil, which is cool :)
6839 2018-10-13 23:42:06 Marina suggested I use Coconut oil to moisturize my face - I tried while eating Chocolate. Then licked my lips only to discover - I taste good.
6840 2018-10-13 23:41:59 I hear you but I was taught all these things from my parents I can change a tire and do oil change learned that from my dad the rest from mom
6841 2018-10-13 23:41:54 maann i wanna go but omega oil calling my first middle and last name
6842 2018-10-13 23:41:50 The majority of Americans don't care if the Saudis killed one of their own. And the GOP won't risk oil price spikes before a midterm.
6843 2018-10-13 23:41:42 Stupid, middle class white people believe that rolling back emission regulations will finally help them land that multi-billion dollar oil deal thus erasing all of their credit card debt.
6844 2018-10-13 23:41:37 #TrueStory.  #JamalKhashoggi's disappearance was because of one tweet.  He tweeted: To #Saudi as well as Arabian Gulf Countries rulers you must stop your family ruling and stealing the oil money and deposit the returns in the western banks
6845 2018-10-13 23:41:31 That was awesome to see you get a top 10 I’m definitely proud of you and all the effort the team put in
6846 2018-10-13 23:41:30 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
6847 2018-10-13 23:41:25 me: can u take this oil and trace the lines of my braids with it?
him: u can’t ask kass (9 yr old)? idk how to do that.

me: ?!?!?!?!?!
6848 2018-10-13 23:41:17 As long as they have oil money nothing will change the relationship.
6849 2018-10-13 23:41:15 Solid run all around, a lot to be proud about.  And is it just me or does the truck just look angry now?  Like it wants to go another 12 rounds and really give everyone a fight?
6850 2018-10-13 23:41:05 I know what you mean! Kind of like the doom and gloom snake oil you keep selling us, about how bad this Trump economy is.
6851 2018-10-13 23:40:38 Great job man! Well deserved!
6852 2018-10-13 23:40:37 Shit oil I got it now

6854 2018-10-13 23:40:34 I was cheering for you in the middle of a discount tire. I got some odd looks! That was awesome though!

How much for the hood 
6855 2018-10-13 23:40:27 Also tea tree oil on the spots at night. They be gone by the next day
6856 2018-10-13 23:40:21 Why no Toyota emblem!!!! Give us the secret!

6859 2018-10-13 23:40:02 I think he's trying to make the point that we are selling our crude to the US at a $50 discount, why not build EE and all Cdns can participate in the benefits of Cdn oil.
6860 2018-10-13 23:39:49 They think they can beat up our young girls and allys by those oil pigs we need to make plans as they will put snitches in. Its time we need to warrior up
6861 2018-10-13 23:39:45 I love cooking chicken in fresh oil ...
6862 2018-10-13 23:39:39 This list is useful to snake oil sales people
6863 2018-10-13 23:39:36 Yes. Olive oil is . And pretty much any animal fat. Butter, lard, tallow, bacon grease, etc.
6864 2018-10-13 23:39:34 Went to Ross for a $15 essential oil set and left with $70 worth of stuff  I hate myself
6865 2018-10-13 23:39:34 All the time!! 

So proud of you today!!
6866 2018-10-13 23:39:31 #TrueStory.  #JamalKhashoggi's disappearance was because of one tweet.  He tweeted: To #Saudi as well as Arabian Gulf Countries rulers you must stop your family ruling and stealing the oil money and deposit the returns in the western banks
6867 2018-10-13 23:39:08 All you say is true. So stick with coal and oil until something perfect magically comes along?

 #1 James Baker's testimony in closed hearing.He blew the doors off of FBI's &DOJ's involvement in the fake dossier & the FISA warrant. #2:China lifts 25% tariffs on oil.#3 Niki Haley’s UN resignation #4 Turkey released the American pastor, Andrew Brunson w no ransom

6871 2018-10-13 23:38:37 My money grubbing state if Ohio has criminalized even the purchase and sale of CBD oil as if this past Thursday (10/12). County prosecutor served my wife's store with papers three weeks ago saying she would be prosecuted for possession of sale of it after that date. Insane.
6872 2018-10-13 23:38:28 People have been selling Snake Oil to each other for decades.
6873 2018-10-13 23:38:27 Got the oil on the hair and the towel on the pillow. How I spend Saturday nights without Connor.

6875 2018-10-13 23:38:07 lol  I'm tempted to say give him what he wants: show up in a leather jacket with spikes on the shoulders, ripped blue jeans, a ripped white tee, motor oil stains all over your fingers, and six days worth of beard growth.  And a bow tie.  Tell him "dressed like a man for you."
6876 2018-10-13 23:38:07 State republican parties nation wide are over regulating the clean energy industry in an effort to kill it and keep their donors in the oil lobby happy. Clean energy jobs are safer and pay better. Is Donald Trump concerned about this?
6877 2018-10-13 23:37:45 Somebody buy me a spray bottle and some oil
6878 2018-10-13 23:37:45 Mine is Rosemary, Olive Oil & Sea Salt! Yours?

- do you ever shave with shave oil instead of soap/foam?
- if so, which brand do you use and why?
6884 2018-10-13 23:37:13 Oil companies are accomplices in genocide.
6885 2018-10-13 23:37:04 oh man, CBD oil WOULD be perfect... watch sobriety be the thing that ends up killing everybody
6886 2018-10-13 23:37:04 Hah hah,,,,, shows you how quickly it is rising.  I had to go double check after I posted, too.  The Saudi's are happy.  MBS worked w/Trump to eject Iran from the oil game so they could raise prices; looks as though it worked.

6889 2018-10-13 23:36:17 oil weres ur aclohole loicense
6890 2018-10-13 23:36:13 JT is getting “kick backs” from Saudi Arabia with the oil we buy, so why would he do anything that would jeopardize that money flow for when he is no longer a politician?
6891 2018-10-13 23:35:56 What I do is I roll up some O.G. Kush 28% thc with a line of activated oil at 73% thc going down the middle. It doesn't totally kill the pain, but it makes me forget abt it for awhile. During the day I just stick to CBD tinctures if needed.
6892 2018-10-13 23:35:49 When I was in school, which was a very long time ago. It was called home economics class. But I don't remember them teaching me how to do an oil change or change a tire. That was auto shop.
6893 2018-10-13 23:35:40 されるがまま(笑)
6894 2018-10-13 23:35:35 I saw a garage with a sign saying  " It's back Pumpkin Spice  oil change!" 
I think it was a joke or I hope it was a joke.
6895 2018-10-13 23:35:35 I can’t wait for the day your oil runs out and you all have to start eating sand.
6896 2018-10-13 23:35:27 chim’s hair is so dry and crunchy pls put some hair oil in it
6897 2018-10-13 23:35:21 All African braiders know is mousse and pink oil.
6898 2018-10-13 23:35:19 the US needs to control the oil because it wants all oil priced in USD. we can't allow russia to seize anything especially if the sell the stuff in Yuan or rubles or euros.
6899 2018-10-13 23:35:03 In the “olden days” you could cook a sausage on the barbie and they would sizzle. Better half bought some sausages, they had canola oil in the ingredients and they  shriveled  not sizzled.
6900 2018-10-13 23:35:00 Use clove oil or simply chew on a clove using the affected tooth
6901 2018-10-13 23:35:00 Im all for it too. You can run tractors off of canola oil with enough technology, saves petrol, cleaner emmissions and cheaper for farmers. Capture methane from pigs and power your home and feedbarns. Many many many ways to be efficient.
6902 2018-10-13 23:34:56 Olive oil in my juul
6903 2018-10-13 23:34:55 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
6904 2018-10-13 23:34:55 Also Yes we do need their crude oil in the Open Market - They produce 12 Million Barrels a Day - we produce around 8 million and Use 16 Million - and the market has a swing capacity of about 2 million - People do not realize how many other things are a petroleum product
6905 2018-10-13 23:34:50 If you are within the belly of the beast. Otherwise you will see: Pillage, economic exploitation, south-north resource drain, British bombs, british drones, British mines polluting our rivers and exploiting people, MNCs destruction of the environment, oil wreckages..list goes on.
6906 2018-10-13 23:34:46 Clochette de Fontenille: a bit difficult to get your hands on...snap it up if you see it. Drizzle with a very fine olive oil, and sprinkle with a smattering of fresh herbs. This will make you happy, especially if you are a fan of soft ripened goat cheese.
6907 2018-10-13 23:34:24 The Magic Carpets of Aladdin ride in AdventureLand in @WaltDisneyWorld are extremely squeaky and the loud metal sounds are cringey and scary. Maybe we can all wish for some oil and maintenance? @WDWToday 
6908 2018-10-13 23:34:24 Could you have a worse take?

The USA is number one in oil production or soon will be... 

And with natural gas being so cheap, we're already beating any carbon targets.

We had the largest reductions last year... far ahead of any competition that singed the paris accord.
6909 2018-10-13 23:34:09 Coconut oil does not work in my hair lol years of using that shit cause everyone hyped it up and it literally DAMAGES my curls

6920 2018-10-13 23:32:41 Is CBD oil the next big thang? Asking for a friend
6921 2018-10-13 23:32:35 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
6922 2018-10-13 23:32:27 I hope you, @JoeManchinWV, and your family, die by drowning in oil. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? ...I guess I mean, Captain Asshole? Quit licking the orange asshole! #FuckYouThatIsAll 
6923 2018-10-13 23:32:15 Because the Bush family was pals with Saudis. They were in oil business together. Bushes aided Saudi Royals who were in US at time of 9/11, helped them leave US before they could be questioned. Doesn’t mean those members were guilty, but they should have been questioned.
6924 2018-10-13 23:32:01 Oil Can Harry minus the stache.
6925 2018-10-13 23:31:58 So I actually have 2 cities going, one I literally started today specifically for the stream & one on a snow maybe that is more like 3 small oil industry based towns near each other.
6926 2018-10-13 23:31:52 I hate cooking with oil! I wish I could substitute it for something else, I think I'm killing myself whenever I'm using oil so I use as little as I possibly can

6929 2018-10-13 23:31:43 What the actual fuck
6930 2018-10-13 23:31:28 Y’all gone stop waiting until 6:30 to try to get y’all damn tires mounted & a oil change. WE READY TO GO!!!
6931 2018-10-13 23:31:27 I got an oil change today and the wait was the most productive 2 hours I’ve had in a long time.
6932 2018-10-13 23:31:24 We need that oil fam
6933 2018-10-13 23:31:07 U need upgraders and refineries for bitumen-tar sands oil is becoming more+more expensive to process and the sweet crude from fracking makes it more and more unnecessary for  to buy from us -there is no evidence China will buy bitumen from  they can get it closer for less
6934 2018-10-13 23:30:56 Remember the Arab Oil Boycott - The US & Saudi relationship traces back to WW2 - the Foundations of Aramco and the Basis of the Dollars supremacy is linked to those relationships - I am NOT condoning what they did - but unless you are prepared for 300 $ Crude Oil Tread lightly
6935 2018-10-13 23:30:50 I bought a new oil diffuser and a white noise machine and I’m just really excited to go to sleep tonight
6936 2018-10-13 23:30:47 So just olive oil?
6937 2018-10-13 23:30:37 Smoking oil is all fun & games until you find yourself stuck on the couch in the same position for 30 mins
6938 2018-10-13 23:30:35 It’s COLD and I didn’t get my eggs or oil and the 39 had better be reasonably on time or I will RAGE.
6939 2018-10-13 23:30:28 There’s oil and potatoes and it all sort of fries. See, they’re crispy, not like roasted potatoes.
6940 2018-10-13 23:30:17 Because I live in NYC and don't drive very much, I don't have to change my oil very often. Somehow since the last time I changed my oil, I lost my oil drain pan. Where did it go? Did I throw it out and just assume that I could absorb the cost of a new one into my oil change?
6941 2018-10-13 23:30:08 Hi. What is the best type of paint pen for rock painting? Oil or acrylic based? Thanks!

6945 2018-10-13 23:29:11 Oil free matte in the south! It’s still 80 degrees and !
6946 2018-10-13 23:29:03 With $100Billion arms deal and oil supplies at risk the USA are never going to take appropriate action against Saudi Arabia.  I would go further to say that the USA created Saudi Arabia in its own image with regard to bumping off people standing in the way
6947 2018-10-13 23:28:55 Yes, the US wants to ensure free transit of oil in the global market. It doesn't need to be allies with KSA to do that, just as it doesn't need to be allies with Iran or Israel to do that.

6949 2018-10-13 23:28:53 chaos oil is soooooo op it's crazy  p

That's amazing
6950 2018-10-13 23:28:23 They are just cut in half, tossed in some olive oil, salt and pepper and bacon. 20 or so minutes at 350.
6951 2018-10-13 23:28:21 Saudi Arabia has been nothing but a pain for 60 years. We no longer need to kiss their ass for oil.
6952 2018-10-13 23:28:20 Think it is time for the govt to look at restricting spending, travel etc. Oil is $14 a barrel more than budgeted for and they still spent almost a 100 million  more? Any other person would be fired. Smarten up Tom Osborne.
6953 2018-10-13 23:28:16 Just as bad. They get a pass because "oil"
6954 2018-10-13 23:28:05 The potatoes are also from my farmer, and are of the Charlotte variety. Oven fried with olive oil.
6955 2018-10-13 23:27:37 So I have been taking CBD oil for 11 days, and my body has been feeling really good. I also have been sleeping a lot better. May start promoting this company! Love helping others would be the reason...
6956 2018-10-13 23:27:34 so what is the major Revenue source of UAE, Qatar and Russia ?

6959 2018-10-13 23:27:00 it’s probably just in my head but that oil change and car wash got my car moving like a hot knife through butter
6960 2018-10-13 23:26:58 So you made a good trade deal? You got some money from them to help the homeless in Canada? There going to buy billions of dollars worth of oil? No, you got socks and photo-ops. That’s all you are. Total failure.

6965 2018-10-13 23:25:52 “... an initial public offering for the state oil behemoth Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, suggesting it would have a $2 trillion valuation...” 
6966 2018-10-13 23:25:50 But so does the fossil fuel industry - there are literally wars being fought over oil. The big oil companies have huge political sway, certainly here in the UK & I would assume in the US too. And it’s great that deforestation is no longer happening in the US, but the Amazon is..
6967 2018-10-13 23:25:49 Today USA export more oil than Venezuela
6968 2018-10-13 23:25:33 傘が荷物になっただけですが降られるよりかはまぁw
6969 2018-10-13 23:25:28 Let me know what happens to US citizens if Saudi Arabia cut off oil supplies. 
Gas prices for example? 
Forget about politics. We have mutual benefits as citizens.
6970 2018-10-13 23:25:27 So does that mean we should continue to overlook human rights abuses? The biggest thing we can do is stop using oil PERIOD

6974 2018-10-13 23:25:06 BTW, I've seen very little discussion on the multiplier effect for resource provinces. Since oil & gas extraction constitute 1/3 of our emissions, any decrease in emissions elsewhere should, theoretically, reduce production in  that sector, thereby shrinking  emissions even more.

6983 2018-10-13 23:23:31 Now if I could only convince those stupid oil company execs that with my weeks of bible college I know what is better for their industry than they do.
6984 2018-10-13 23:23:25 The paradox is that oil prize is also rising up in a small part because Venezuela is not producing its OPEC quotaquote moment we start producing oil prices will also slow down and even fall.

6988 2018-10-13 23:23:13 Yeah, "Pleather" disintegrates, and it's made from oil, and personally I think plastic furs probably contribute to microplastics in the oceans. It's best to use vegetable leathers and tbh invasive species would be a good source of fur, even if people find it distasteful.
6989 2018-10-13 23:22:44 Yeah but, you know, oil, money, all that shit.
6990 2018-10-13 23:22:43 Go for his legs, rather than eating his shoulder and getting lit up like a Gulf War oil well. Then he'd force him to pass and then the Waikato prop could make the cover tackle on the guy that eventually scores.

7006 2018-10-13 23:19:44 Thaw. Put in a bag with olive oil, minced garlic, and rosemary. Marinate 20 min. Cook in a pan with a little butter, ~5-6 min each side. Watch the black pepper, will get too spicy

Those incompetent oil pundits only focused on the #Iranian-phobia but totally ignored other factors below:
Higher interest rate
Stronger dollar 
intensified #US-#Sino #tradewar
Slower #Chinese oil demand
Continued #Iran oil exports to #India and #China
and more...
7013 2018-10-13 23:19:02 Thanks! Also I could get a medical card ezpz and probably spot-manage bad anxiety moments with CBD oil.

7015 2018-10-13 23:18:39 Of course not. He's busy protecting oil and gas corporations and their billionaire CEO donors. Perhaps #HurricaneMichael will send Shockwaves to the Florida voters that he needs to be out of government service completely. #VoteBlue
7016 2018-10-13 23:18:38 Yooo stir frys are great and really easy :D  Fry vegetables and/or some chicken in a pan. Throw in some soy sauce, sesame oil and chilli sauce. Throw in some noodles and you're done :D

It's the oil part I missed.
7020 2018-10-13 23:17:52 You sound  very gullible. Do you think the Empire went off to save some Syrian peasants. The oil interests in the Golan and trans Syrian pipeline are the main impetus.  When have the elites anywhere given a damn about the peasants. Do you still believe the Saddam WMD bullshit.
7021 2018-10-13 23:17:51 I just want that big oil money bro

7023 2018-10-13 23:17:30 So, I got ready to wash my hair only to remember that I don’t have liquid soap 

And I don’t have enough oil for my hot oil treatment.. what is life.

7035 2018-10-13 23:15:22 Why are we fighting a damned 17 year war when we have the ability to wipe these sum'biches off the face of the earth in a millisecond? Nothing in the Middle East worth saving except the oil and it will be there.
7036 2018-10-13 23:15:21 I heard the same crap conspiracy when Obama was president. It didn’t work then, it doesn’t work now. Why do these nut jobs keep peddling snake oil?
7037 2018-10-13 23:15:10 @GrouponHelpUS Purchase a Groupon Coupon for an oil change at SynFast Oil Change and they are refusing to accept it even though it has not expired. Can I get a refund?
7038 2018-10-13 23:15:05 And it’s not like they glued it to an oil painting.  Just remove the eyes and get some goo to clean it.  It’s not hard.
7039 2018-10-13 23:15:03 Saying that Venezuela produces oil and has the largest oil reserves in the world is a factual statement regardless of what the US produces. Nice try.
7040 2018-10-13 23:15:00 I really love rosehip seed oil from the ordinary 
7041 2018-10-13 23:14:56 CVE should be doing well, but it won’t have any control over all the pipeline crap going on In Canada

Hopefully they approve some of these huge projects before the oil becomes worthless
7042 2018-10-13 23:14:47 I just realized Kevin Bacon is playing the same role as Antonio Banderas in Life Itself, but minus the (so, so) long monologues about Spanish olive oil. He’s got quite the sympathy for cuckers.

7045 2018-10-13 23:14:30 Getting two oil boilers replaced with gas next week, and I'm feeling clever for timing the oil burn so I have one empty tank and one only 1/8 full. 
7046 2018-10-13 23:14:08 unless they had a lot of oil
7047 2018-10-13 23:14:05 That oil painting tho
7048 2018-10-13 23:14:01 It's a really great graph for visual representation of the amount of energy different countries use, it's a really awful graph in the way that it shows how much energy is used and by who. 

Also it's interesting Brazil is half Agriculture in CO2, probably rainforest oil and meat.

7059 2018-10-13 23:13:02 All 3 things I mentioned are true, not vomit.1) The new Jim Crow statement by Beto, last month at Prarie View A&M university.
(2) supports higher taxes, like a $10.00 per barrel tax on oil, for one, there's more. (3) Nas voted with Pelosi 93% of the time1/2
7060 2018-10-13 23:13:01 TarSands shit??? You don’t have a clue what you are talking about... Petrochemicals are set to account for more than a third of the growth in world oil demand to 2030 according to the IEA.
7061 2018-10-13 23:12:59 As time goes by, I feel CIA killed #Khashoggi may be to pressure #Saudi to pump more oil and reduce prices. Trump did say ‘two weeks’

7066 2018-10-13 23:12:36 So let’s chat about how great the economy is doing. Interest rates are higher resulting in higher costs for mortgages, etc. has anyone noticed the price of oil and gasoline? Stock market took a hit past week. Anyone want to weigh in?
7067 2018-10-13 23:12:33 You're the one who keeps mentioning atms sales and oil, not me. Why bother replying to someone on twitter if you don't bother to read and engage with what is actually said.
7068 2018-10-13 23:12:26 I just started Macy oil in coffee why is it good?

7082 2018-10-13 23:09:38 I did olive oil, but butter works too.

Very meaty tasting, almost like beef.
7083 2018-10-13 23:09:37 Wont make any diff if people stop driving cuz gas is too expensive. The current price for crude ($71/barrel) means gas should be closer to $2.85/gal NOT $4+ - in 2008 when oil went from $150/barrel to $50/barrel gas dropped to $1.90/gal - we’re gettin fucked @coccodrillo21
7084 2018-10-13 23:09:36 “Not a "magic wand" but good policies & tax cuts.“ Nothing like a major rebound in the oil sector to give a Trump apologist an opportunity to yell ‘his policies.’ There is NO PROOF that tax cuts have led to hiring, anywhere, and, especially not manufacturing.
7085 2018-10-13 23:09:35 They have been so brainwashed to believe that anyone who advances their social agenda is a good person.  For thirty years a group  of voters have[ values voters]  telegraphed  to the nation what it would take to con them. Along comes two of the best snake oil sellers 1/.
7086 2018-10-13 23:09:07 just accidentally snorted a mix of salt and tea tree oil whilst cleaning my piercing and good lord that was unpleasant
7087 2018-10-13 23:08:51 Let us not forget raising taxes, regulating oil and gas industry, banning AR-15's and wanting more gun regulations. Weaking immigration policies, abolishing ICE and immigration facilities.
7088 2018-10-13 23:08:40 Total nonsense. There’s zero chance that a lack of workers is the reason the plants were destroyed. They could have easily taken longer to harvest and used the flower for extraction to make oil.
7089 2018-10-13 23:08:34 You say that now, but your oil prices will skyrocket - if there was a limited ban on Saudi oil, it would affect the dollar and hyperinflate everyday prices, yes the prices of oil is high at the moment, it won't come down any time soon either. 
it's the only economic option US has
7090 2018-10-13 23:08:28 We will need oil to power us once the sun goes away! That or nuclear.
7091 2018-10-13 23:08:26 If u’ve been conversant with my tweets, i dont think u’ll ask me to emulate anybody, coz my tweets and interactions with tweeps on here says it all.
7092 2018-10-13 23:08:26 We actually export a large portion of our own oil.
7093 2018-10-13 23:08:22 Yes, especially with hot oil!

7096 2018-10-13 23:08:04 If oil is "Passe" as @TzeporahBerman suggests, why is its consumption growing every single year?
7097 2018-10-13 23:07:43 Bucky Badger is my current favorite. Good taste.
Not sure about the oil, I just assume they all use veg oil.
7098 2018-10-13 23:07:11 You don’t know what you are talking about. Heard of petrodollar? Heard of 10 million barrels of oil every fricken day?

7101 2018-10-13 23:06:47 't you post links to denial blogs, frauds, and paid oil shills. That is all you post and it would save space and time for you and your readers. Or are you empathy challenged?

7104 2018-10-13 23:06:24 Why fracturing drill and to find what? Water, gas or oil. As it is fracking drilling, I am thinking of shale gas.
It is harmful to environment and  even more to pollute groundwater, they will use lot of water. Catastrophic for ecosystem.

7111 2018-10-13 23:05:18 I know! I'm so over this idiot charcoal teeth whitening trend. It feels like sandpaper and my teeth were in pain for a few days after using it. However, I do use a charcoal mouthwash that has coconut oil in it and that hasn't bothered my teeth yet which is good.

7113 2018-10-13 23:05:15 The discussion on "carbon" should have nothing to do with so-called CO2 pollution but rather the need to eventually move away from a carbon based society into those aspects which have equivalents.  Oil is limited and for some applications there is no substitute.
7114 2018-10-13 23:05:12 Plus oil is dirty. It isn’t the “liquid gold” we used to consider it years ago. We should be investing time and money into cleaner energy sources.

7117 2018-10-13 23:04:42 I hope you work your ass off for 10-15-20+ years in the fire department...the politics severely change and they elect an oil/gas businessman to become the chief of your fire department.

7120 2018-10-13 23:04:11 Hahahah! They are part of the country and they actually work in oil companies like any other citizens. They have their own courts and school and they practice their life peacefully and equally.

7129 2018-10-13 23:03:19 I think you missed my point. Even when we had the oil boom here, only a small percentage of NLer's got good paying jobs in the industry. The majority here continued to work in low income jobs. Doesn't matter how hard you work, it's the paycheck that counts.
7130 2018-10-13 23:03:14 I found a company in Vermont that got good reviews and they provide lab results for each of their batches of CBD. I verified that the lab they use is legit and companies results were good. I'm using the oil in liquid form with a dropper. I figure it can't hurt.

7135 2018-10-13 23:02:49 Trump is for SALE. we will sell him cheap. In the mean time he has been bribed by Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
They both want a war with Iran. As do the Koch Bros. Why? I dont know. I assume they want their Damn oil. 
Selfish Bas***ds

7140 2018-10-13 23:02:23 Last week, fourth grade students learned why it is important to protect our natural resources. We discussed how an oil spill can affect our other natural resources. Students had to clean an oil spill out from water and "wildlife" (feathers).

7145 2018-10-13 23:01:51 Lmao me with Rigo when he changes my oil 
7146 2018-10-13 23:01:42 The trick is to mix it with a good body oil. I used the Nivea sun cream and grape seed oil
7147 2018-10-13 23:01:31 In the old Testament, GOD gave the priests a charge to make sure the flame in the temple never went out. The Children of Israel would bring the pure Olive oil to keep the flame burning. I feel like the LORD put this ON my heart tonight studying. The flame wasn't the major issue
7148 2018-10-13 23:01:28 The U.S. has financially tethered itself to the Saudi government.  First with oil, then with real estate.  They will overlook a lot of "indiscretions" to keep the money flowing.  Couple that with alienating most of the  rest of the region, and we'll justify it for military needs.

7150 2018-10-13 23:01:06 You're absolutely right: sacrificing any group is unconscionable.  Yet you oil & gas folks believe the rest of the world should be sacrificed so you and your bought & paid for politicians feather your nest. The money being squandered on pipelines would have paid for retraining.
7151 2018-10-13 23:01:05 So eating vegan is way cheaper.. I'm not vegan at all but am cuz I can't afford meat or dairy. Veggies are mad cheap n I just throw them in the oven with olive oil n rosemary then eat with rice/pasta/quinoa. Eggs are kinda great for protein that's my main deal
7152 2018-10-13 23:01:00 It was a shock to me. I have recently switched to Vego hazelnut spread which is just as good. I will sent you a snap. Dairy free, palm oil free..
7153 2018-10-13 23:00:49 Babe changed my oil, & cleaned/washed my truck today 
7154 2018-10-13 23:00:45 Excellent, well-founded, factual article. You have every reason to be furious that our national government under Trump effectively has dismissed the murder of Khashoggi as less important than selling us oil.
7155 2018-10-13 23:00:39 Anyone in or near shire, awake and have some vegetable/sunflower oil I can pinch?
7156 2018-10-13 23:00:33 Have you tried dosing less oil more often?  Also, do you dose the CBD-rich with the THC-rich?  Together, they apparently work better and work longer.
7157 2018-10-13 23:00:30 We already have Socialism: Medicare, Social Security, the Military, tax breaks for billionaires, the taxpayer bailout of Wall Street, the fixing of drug prices by Bush, billions to the oil industry and defense contractors, cost of airports, taxpayer $ to professional sports teams
7158 2018-10-13 23:00:29 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Tax this money 50% and build the wall!

7161 2018-10-13 23:00:04 @elonmusk so basically a secret group of big money lobbyists sat around with their bought and paid for politicians and realized that you are a threat to corporate greed and politics. You are putting their oil and gas business in jeopardy. #notaconspiracy

7162 2018-10-13 22:59:57 Does it still have palm oil in it?
7163 2018-10-13 22:59:56 Or that he's blowing up the future value of oil, gas, auto, aerospace and utility stocks. People get upset over so little, these days.

7165 2018-10-13 22:59:55 Jason, why should she apologize for something the oil executives wanted? Maybe you should ask those guys why they asked for her to be appointed? But you wont, will you. No narrative in that.
7166 2018-10-13 22:59:45 My new car so lit , it has 2 oil filter 
7167 2018-10-13 22:59:33 @WhiteHouse FBI Investigation Into Alberta Oilsands Companies. Selling Oil At Discount. It's Larceny. To Why NDP Allow It. The Oil Is Mine.

7170 2018-10-13 22:58:59 Is this because they charge you 2000$ for an oil change ?

7172 2018-10-13 22:58:33 もう誰が誰なんですかーー！！
7173 2018-10-13 22:58:30 So sorry to see this. You take such good care of your yard.  One time someone drove onto my moms yards hit my parked car wrapped it around the tree and drove away.  He got about 1 mile before his car broke down. I tracked the oil trail and he was charged.  Nobody was home at time
7174 2018-10-13 22:58:16 Gotta get that foreign oil money, and fuck the consequences.
7175 2018-10-13 22:58:14 Sigh. I just got it cuz I heard it’s good for those things. I’ll use it out and see it has tea tree oil in it
7176 2018-10-13 22:58:12 Get him some oil or a new wig
7177 2018-10-13 22:58:09 This sickens me so much! So many people say to me, "Oh, you should be employed soon...I see oil prices are improving". Not in Alberta! Sad I still collect EI and will soon need to find a job bagging groceries at Superstore. I have 25 years oil/gas experience and a CPA/CMA. Sad!
7178 2018-10-13 22:57:59 Oil is the blood of the devil.  More lives have been lost, societies destroyed, and now our entire ecosystem is at risk because of it.  Only good things will happen if we can change our energy sources and leave oil in the ground.
7179 2018-10-13 22:57:58 You coukd try CPD (cannabis oil) for dogs it is good for a number of things anxiety and pain etc. There are also wraps (bandage not sandwich) that are supposed keep dogs calm but not actually ever tried those.
7180 2018-10-13 22:57:48 yah i just have no pain tolerance and my hair shows oil fast bc it’s so blonde, so I’m very Not About That.
7181 2018-10-13 22:57:44 Beverly Hills high school built oil wells on campus that released dangerous gasses and that was ok because that made the school rich.

7188 2018-10-13 22:56:57 Not just the Guardian but to be frank i tested steele on a few occations and to be honest he is not that well informed on ME .. he is a leftist opinionist at best and more of an Iran appologist when you squeeze the oil out

7198 2018-10-13 22:55:29 Sprinkling Lemon grass oil on ya pillowsbbefore going to bed makes me sleep real tight.
7199 2018-10-13 22:55:26 And? The entire world economy is fundamentally based on oil. This won't change overnight.
7200 2018-10-13 22:55:20 i personally believe that everyone should have a chance to perform at lucas oil stadium. it is definitely a life changing experience.
7201 2018-10-13 22:55:18 And what is the purpose of U.S. influence in the Middle East, anyway?  It used to be for access to oil and fighting the proxy Cold War.  But it turns out buying all that oil and interfering militarily has only increased strife & instability in the Middle East...and inspired 9/11.

7203 2018-10-13 22:55:11 Big Oil will continue to trash musk and anyone in the electric car market. If mother Theresa did it the pope himself would be made to pour shit on her. Nikolai Tesla’s vision was for free access to natural electricity and neither cars nor tequila brings that to light
7204 2018-10-13 22:54:48 The oil companies requested her to make sure that every point of view was heard.
7205 2018-10-13 22:54:46 Olive oil? It usually does the job
7206 2018-10-13 22:54:29 Wow I love this man!!! Took my car for an oil change and filled my tank 
7207 2018-10-13 22:54:24 I need car places to figure out I will never take care of that problem that changes every time I get an oil change and also costs like $150

7212 2018-10-13 22:53:35 All charges against Duffy dropped. So there’s that. Berman, while passionate, is doing great harm to this country, for what? Not a single drop less oil is used worldwide.
7213 2018-10-13 22:53:33 "oil companies." Like… companies. Who… y'know…SELL. Oil.

7222 2018-10-13 22:52:04 Also, according to the pundits we should be out of oil right now.
7223 2018-10-13 22:52:00 Total crude oil and petroleum product exports for the first six months of 2018 hit a record 7.3 million barrels a day.
7224 2018-10-13 22:51:43 Coconut oil & brown sugar lip scrub.  my lips feel heavenly now 
7225 2018-10-13 22:51:40 If it was not for oil, you would have been nothing. Still, you have to pay foreigners to do all work for you.  Frankly, you as a race have no value to humanity.
7226 2018-10-13 22:51:39 さては鎧裂大剣強いな？
7227 2018-10-13 22:51:39 that's what too much msm will do to you. do you know USA is now the top producer of oil in the world over Russia and Saudi Arabia? think about that! (if you can)
7228 2018-10-13 22:51:36 The oil is amazing also,
7229 2018-10-13 22:51:35 CBD oil or edibles will help immensely.
7230 2018-10-13 22:51:34 ugh i hate making vegan mayo out of oil but i ran out of tofu and i need it for tomorrow so there’s no other way
7231 2018-10-13 22:51:18 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

7232 2018-10-13 22:51:16 Easy didn't have enough oil to deep fry it XD
7233 2018-10-13 22:51:04 The world will need Saudi oil when the full sanctions against Iran go into place in ~2 months.  Will result in tightening supplies and prices will rise. Saudi oil can stabilize prices if OPEC agrees.
7234 2018-10-13 22:50:59 It’s producing oil what do they expect to be pulling up at site an ice cream truck
7235 2018-10-13 22:50:59 I'm thinking they think he's covered himself by putting those beautiful babies in oil.. upsetting really is
7236 2018-10-13 22:50:58 The are better oils tho.. coconut oil is so much better. And it’s affordable!
7237 2018-10-13 22:50:57 @NickFaldo006 I cannot believe that I didnt capture that 2nd photo today, embarrassingly. Next time I'll definitely do the oil painting... or maybe look out for you tomorrow too 
7238 2018-10-13 22:50:44 Thanks for the correction

7240 2018-10-13 22:50:16 Harper signed off millions of acres of oil sands to Kock bros., what was the payback??????
7241 2018-10-13 22:50:11 If anyone's worried about this (and you should), and still want to eat out, trick I've often used is to bring a flask of my preferred oil and ask them to use.

I had a Thai place that always made my stuff in coconut oil. I'd just drop off a jar every couple months.
7242 2018-10-13 22:50:02 "…and now energy companies want to drill for oil and gas in those areas."

Like…it wasn't great practice in the first place, but what brought it up as a problem in 2015 was folx wanting to drill for oil and gas there so they could, y'know, sell it off, thus worsening the climat
7243 2018-10-13 22:50:02 But. Not a money spinner like the snake oil schemes. Cheap, short term and expensive power = high profits. #renewables 

Long term, cheap power is not a "race track" windfall winner for the shareholders.

7245 2018-10-13 22:49:44 he does both in case you have not noticed.... too much TV won't give you facts. do you know his many accomplishments in less than 2 years he's been in office? one big news for you - the USA is not the top producer of oil over Russia and Saudi Arabia! google it!
7246 2018-10-13 22:49:41 I need to finish my drink and then I need to get eggs and vegetable oil. I’ve got this. But not really.
7247 2018-10-13 22:49:39 CBD is very low in most marijuana now, however there is a good industry springing up for the oil and other health products containing CBD, which has the opposite effect of THC. The ratio between the two is higher than ever, and has caused increased anxiety, etc for some who smoke
7248 2018-10-13 22:49:35 i didnt make this tweet to be an apologist- we need to keep our foot on the necks of those control oil, coal,and natural gas industries. i also hate that it’s white people, who destroyed the earth + massacred indigenous populations to do so, who are leading sustainability convos
7249 2018-10-13 22:49:30 Yum! That looks great. I usually do olive oil and Italian seasoning, rosemary, salt and pepper or replacing spaghetti noodles. Yours looks way more interesting
7250 2018-10-13 22:49:29 Oil pipelines protests....
7251 2018-10-13 22:49:26 How about hot oil wrestling with me, instead?   

Careful: not my first rodeo....
7252 2018-10-13 22:49:26 OPEC does not control the price of oil.  They are a group of suppliers of a commodity that attempts to control their output to affect world supply and demand hence affecting the commodity price.  They are nearly powerless now because of decisiveness and other suppliers (US)
7253 2018-10-13 22:49:11 so, one scenario is locally carbon neutral (you use your solar, to make car juice) the other is a net reduction of 4 units of oil for the planet.

7256 2018-10-13 22:48:37 We used to need their oil. We don't anymore.
7257 2018-10-13 22:48:35 The U.S. buys most of its oil from Canada
7258 2018-10-13 22:48:31 Medical professionals started using the term doctor, taken from academic circles, to give themselves credence and differentiate between quacks/snake oil salesmen and people who studied. Academics were the original doctors.
7259 2018-10-13 22:48:30 Even if both are PhD holders shoe get size PhD get level na! Abi you wan compare PhD Islamic Sharia Law & @Zahrahmusa 's. Mba! No! I no gree
7260 2018-10-13 22:48:17 I’ll have my oil and my prayer cloth
7261 2018-10-13 22:48:03 OK, so you can make some carbon-free electricity. Lets say it takes 5 units of electricity to make 1 unit of car juice, but you could plug your 5 units of electricity into the grid - allowing someone else to use 5 fewer oil units and you burn one unit of dinosaur oil in the car.

7268 2018-10-13 22:47:18 You’ve swallowed the imperialist BS hook, line and sinker lad. Are you hoping to get a backhander from Murdoch out of the oil he’s stealing?

7274 2018-10-13 22:46:58 Still put some oil on what’s left

These reflect movements in the international oil market.
7277 2018-10-13 22:45:58 that, coconut oil (highly comedogenic and not safe for sensitive skin), anything with fragrance in like the first three ingredients (artificial fragrance in general if im being real), raw shea butter on the face (like ????; re: coco oil), undiluted tea tree...the list goes on
7278 2018-10-13 22:45:43 I look forward to your posts defending snake oil
7279 2018-10-13 22:45:38 I'm getting my oil changed and I'm being forced to sit next to this white lady talking about essential oils
7280 2018-10-13 22:45:31 Aaaand I fell back asleep. I guess I'll take a hot shower with Raven oil and start dinner so I can take more meds
7281 2018-10-13 22:45:02 Do you have a stinky house? Freshen it up with Glade® PlugIns® Scented Oil in Cashmere Woods® scent. You can pick them up at Walmart! #AD #cleanhouse #homemaking #GladePlugInsAtWalmart
7282 2018-10-13 22:44:57 Looks like an oil painting 
7283 2018-10-13 22:44:54 Demogogue Trump will fail spectacularly at the midterms and his snake oil tongue will be his indictment.
7284 2018-10-13 22:44:51 I've decided to try CBD oil to help during the upcoming stressful period of time. I used it when I quit smoking and it certainly didn't hurt. Any of you lovelies use CBD on a regular basis?
7285 2018-10-13 22:44:50 trade center holocaust should be a red flag inspite of saudi oil and weapon income stream?

7290 2018-10-13 22:44:03 Oil.  Thanks; regional stabilization for American nation building.

7292 2018-10-13 22:44:00 500mg of Gerin Oil and some more Ablixa
7293 2018-10-13 22:43:49 As you know @MargMcCuaigBoyd I have never treated the economy and environment as exclusive. Pushing a new pipeline when world leading banks & economists are calling for no new expansion of oil sands is not good economic policy
7294 2018-10-13 22:43:41 The Witcher:
It was a cold day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
7295 2018-10-13 22:43:41 That'll take a lot more oil than is currently in the house...
7296 2018-10-13 22:43:41 “Not a "magic wand" but good policies & tax cuts.“ Nothing like a major rebound in the oil sector to give a Trump apologist an opportunity to yell ‘his policies.’ There is NO PROOF that tax cuts have led to hiring, anywhere, and, especially not manufacturing.
7297 2018-10-13 22:43:38 @JoeVargas is it ok to drink coffee if you use CBD oil? I read it wasn't but Google has some dumb ppl saying shit. I try to avoid caffeine & haven't had any for almost 6 months. I need a boost some days though.
7298 2018-10-13 22:43:29 don’t go there.  I find it upsetting.  just leave it out, rise above them.  they don’t need you, stay here and be quiet x
7299 2018-10-13 22:42:54 Every household should have Lemon pepper seasoning and tea tree oil. If you don’t have those necessities pls don’t invite me over.
7300 2018-10-13 22:42:49 The high-riding toy truck boys aren't scared about the oil pan but you could probably get their attention by hemming them on both sides with jersey barriers.  Best to leave 8ft or less.
7301 2018-10-13 22:42:42 *Scalding*
7302 2018-10-13 22:42:39 Not even close @chicohmfc go and look to see where we get our oil from these days.  Just google it...its very simple.  Our partners to the North and South provide upwards of 50%
7303 2018-10-13 22:42:30 右肩の方が可動域有りますね
7304 2018-10-13 22:42:29 بلاش تمثيل بقى ال coconut water out of the coconut it self ريحتها و طعمها مقرف

7305 2018-10-13 22:42:23 Oil dey your head 
7306 2018-10-13 22:42:20 Fact check. You are not a lawful appointed sheriff, right? How many civil lawsuits are you fighting at this point Drumpf-ite? As they say in Texas, you are all hat and no oil. Find a racist rock to crawl under and hibernate til the unicorns cone for you.
7307 2018-10-13 22:42:01 used baby oil before my bath to take off my tan and i’ve basically done micro dermabrasion to my legs ???
7308 2018-10-13 22:41:57 Only the snake oil salesman can DEPORT RANDOM CHILDREN!
7309 2018-10-13 22:41:41 Anybody wanna change my oil?

7312 2018-10-13 22:41:15 You are the Grand Wizard of this MAGA Supremacy Rally. You are a snake oil salesman using people and destroying our Great Nation
7313 2018-10-13 22:41:15 All it does is allow the US to print pieces of paper and have Saudi Arabia exchange its oil in order to maintain America's standard of living.
7314 2018-10-13 22:40:59 Or add smashbox primer oil to it before putting it on your face. If you need one that’s a little bit cheaper nyx has a hydro touch oil that’s really good too!!
7315 2018-10-13 22:40:56 多分もりみち病院のOIL KING♡を関西のクラブイベントで流したの初じゃないかと思ってる。この曲入ってるナゼナラバってアルバム他にも良い曲あるので是非聴いてください
7316 2018-10-13 22:40:55 @Monr0Muffler Had a horrible experience during an oil change. The technician forgot to put the cap back on, and oil sprayed all over the engine while I was driving. I couldn't even breath! The fumes were that bad. Still haven't gotten my money back despite MULTIPLE attempts.
7317 2018-10-13 22:40:55 The US is already on the cusp of being a net exporter of oil. And could get there even faster if we wanted to. We do NOT need anyone's oil, in fact. And certainly not from the brutal leaders of the house of Saud.
7318 2018-10-13 22:40:31 Beard oil and coconut oil has changed my life lol
7319 2018-10-13 22:40:24 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
7320 2018-10-13 22:40:07 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
7321 2018-10-13 22:39:58 what really matters is they have to keep selling their oil for dollars
7322 2018-10-13 22:39:53 it is the Hill! it is the Hill that is, well here it is and nothing to fear.  long ways upwards and nothing to fear, here is our Hill  for sharing x
7323 2018-10-13 22:39:42 It's not a matter of who's smart and who's not. Type 1: bad writer. Type 2: good writer. Type 3: seller of snake oil, trying to put one over on you. Type 4: Complicated material. Could be that types 1, 3, and 4 are hard to tell apart. Could be 2 and 3 are hard to tell apart.
7324 2018-10-13 22:39:31 It’s not the only oil that Canada has. And yes I been to Fort McMurray.
7325 2018-10-13 22:39:19 I read vegetable oil the first two times, and was legit gonna try it
7326 2018-10-13 22:38:58 Oh, I remember you tweeting about that! Derek's mom uses peppermint oil for her stomach troubles and it works! I'm mainly referring to those MLM ladies who stay home and sell them on Facebook. Sorry. D:
7327 2018-10-13 22:38:38 Deer God, now people are trying to change God's word, saying that Cannabis was in the anointing oil. They also claim that Calamus, which actually is in the anointing oil, is toxic. The toxicity was debunked years ago and the restrictions on Calamus in the USA were lifted.
7328 2018-10-13 22:38:26 I saw u used oil but YEAH THATS always been my alternative it really breaks down the product when you rub it and comes of pretty well after you rinse…
7329 2018-10-13 22:38:23 Best I’m coming up with is blending a bit of the oil and seasonings into the chick peas to make cajun seasoned hummus.
Sorry I’m not being much help.
7330 2018-10-13 22:38:14 Nope, it’ll be because a few corporations wanted to profit from oil as much as possible
7331 2018-10-13 22:38:09 so i put a TON of coconut oil in my hair to prepare it for something i’m about to do and honestly it’s all over my forehead so catch me breaking tf out yall
7332 2018-10-13 22:38:06 Drink some castor oil mixed with orange juice
7333 2018-10-13 22:38:03 palm oil is the most environmentally and animal friendly oil to use in food.  it yields the most crop with the least resources/danger

I’m all for avoiding it when practical but it is vegan
7334 2018-10-13 22:38:03 Spent the afternoon in the shop teaching my son how to change oil and fuel filters. Then he cleaned the cab and I waxed the hood. #bonding
7335 2018-10-13 22:37:54 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
7336 2018-10-13 22:37:52 It's got nothing to do with you or the Regressive Conservatives. World oil prices are down, stupid. And where's  the 10 cent a litre price reduction promise anyway, fuckface?
7337 2018-10-13 22:37:41 ...& we drill our own oil!
7338 2018-10-13 22:37:37 My dad is here and so far I have heard about 30 stories, the best of which was about him hitting CBD oil for the first time while visiting his Navy friend in the mountains of Western NC. He ended up lying in his friend's driveway.
7339 2018-10-13 22:37:25 If I remember correctly, one responsibility of this Texas Dept is to set and collect FEES from companies that extract resources (like oil & gas) from our public lands. Important money for the State budget. Especially the “PUF”, the Permanent University Fund.

Go and Get Them! 
7340 2018-10-13 22:37:21 No. We don’t need their oil. It’s a global market.
7341 2018-10-13 22:36:55 I think on oil this policy is broadly emissions neutral. The reasons emissions increase is on the gas side.
7342 2018-10-13 22:36:46 excuse me, salad with cucumber with olive oil, a pinch of salt and a hint of vinegar is the best you can have when your stomach doesn't feel good ... it refreshes you ... i don't feel good so I was craving it haha 
7343 2018-10-13 22:36:38 Nope. I am for moving past oil. But oil is global and fungible. Who they sell to makes no difference.
7344 2018-10-13 22:36:35 I’ll go Mike - stable oil markets?
7345 2018-10-13 22:36:34 My room smells like orange oil, lemongrass, and peppermint. I love it! 
7346 2018-10-13 22:36:33 This has been a helluva ball game
7347 2018-10-13 22:36:28 Explain why. What about oil and arms sales?
7348 2018-10-13 22:36:14 Our biggest source of imported oil is still Canada. Right?
7349 2018-10-13 22:36:11 Not enough 
I suggest you stop buying Saudi oil and show us how you can live without it 
7350 2018-10-13 22:36:07 Ethical oil is an oxymoron.
7351 2018-10-13 22:36:02 Can't wait till solid state batteries for the mainstream, then these oil cartels are toast.. it's slowly happening
7352 2018-10-13 22:35:51 I smell of chlorinated pool water, coconut oil and onion rings.

Drink it in ladies.

I am worn out. Gonna order room service pizza and a family movie.

*Extra Pillows
7353 2018-10-13 22:35:48 I thought palm oil was already considered nonvegan? I mean there’s nothing wrong with being called plant-based. vegan is more about animal-welfare :/
7354 2018-10-13 22:35:44 We’d need to transition away from oil. Or force private oil companies to keep US oil within the US
7355 2018-10-13 22:35:39 I've been taking #CBDoil for my #neuropathy and it helps some with the pain. Yesterday I bought some #CBDextract and it works better than the oil.
7356 2018-10-13 22:35:35 Our problem is oil backed currency, so, hands are kind of tied up a bit.
7357 2018-10-13 22:35:31 You missed the point. Oil is global and fungible. Who they sell to makes no difference.
7358 2018-10-13 22:35:28 Coconut oil exists
7359 2018-10-13 22:35:27 They need all the help they can get.
7360 2018-10-13 22:35:13 Canadian provincial and federal governments of the past (conservatives) are also to blame for this. It was massively short sighted not to engage with those needed to build pipelines to tidewater when they developed the oil sands.
7361 2018-10-13 22:34:49 All I want to do is take a hot shower and go to sleep . Why my oil light had to come on 
7362 2018-10-13 22:34:47 Ooooh, you used the oil equipment insult. Dayum
7363 2018-10-13 22:34:46 Plus. Canada. If we had an oil emergency we have friends with oil.
7364 2018-10-13 22:34:22 robots cum oil lol
7365 2018-10-13 22:34:16 Gas/oil
7366 2018-10-13 22:34:13 To be fair I've been using CBD oil gummies for my anxiety and its REALLY helped but yeah 90% of that stuff is pure bullshit
7367 2018-10-13 22:34:09 It apparently helped 
7368 2018-10-13 22:33:58 That would only hurt US. Where else do they get enough oil?
7369 2018-10-13 22:33:55 hop on the oil bus with us 
7370 2018-10-13 22:33:51 Did we water our grass with baby oil WHY IS EVERYONE SLIPPING LIKE THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW TO RUN

7374 2018-10-13 22:33:08 Where was your outrage when Hilary and every other president was taking money from the Saudis? When did you call them out after 9/11? All of you politicians are frauds on the Saudi’s because of oil. Be real @SenWarren

7379 2018-10-13 22:32:21 Anyone know of any RTO positions available or the like in oil close to NO?
7380 2018-10-13 22:32:16 Better question would be what didn't he say that didn't make sense, guns was right on, dems failing Black america was on the mark.  What you didn't like what he said because he didn't sound like a smooth snake oil salesmen instead of a regular guy.
7381 2018-10-13 22:32:15 There is NOTHING that Saudi Arabia has that should make America compromise it's values....there is oil everywhere....
7382 2018-10-13 22:32:12 You kissed the point that oil is a fungible commodity that is sold globally. They put it on the market, our access to their oil has no consequences.
7383 2018-10-13 22:32:12 Aside from "changing tire/oil" Isn't that called Home Economics? And yes it was a mandatory course when I went to HS.
7384 2018-10-13 22:32:09 #WorstNakedActivity Omg cooking bacon. I tried to be sexy one time....oil burns on my nipples. Never again
7385 2018-10-13 22:32:02 Condition with red oil. It will shed, if it dries often, leading to breakage. Treat scalp with teatree oil, of red oil is 'gross' for you, try honey + egg. Then, oil with Shea often
7386 2018-10-13 22:31:59 That was some impressive stuff from Jeffress and company. Wow.
7387 2018-10-13 22:31:46 Everyone has caught on to your tactics. Keep lying point to your “enemies”.  Everyone sees your snake oil circus tactics

7393 2018-10-13 22:30:42 Tf? When I say oil does it imply gold?

Don't always try to be "savage" smh
7394 2018-10-13 22:30:33 We should be weaning ourselves off oil anyway
7395 2018-10-13 22:30:11 Fries are terrible when they're cold. Even Moreso When they're microwaved back. How to fix this problem? Fry them in a frying pan with some oil.
7396 2018-10-13 22:30:08 Do you really think I would accept payment in a horribly managed currency like the Rupel? I accept payment in oil from the keystone pipeline.
7397 2018-10-13 22:30:05 As an oil rich, radically religious nation we need them to not develop nuclear weapons.
7398 2018-10-13 22:29:53 Whale fat! Cover your body with it to insulate. Also good for waxing the skis on a dog sled and fueling oil lamps 
7399 2018-10-13 22:29:37 2 oil changes done this afternoon. One carport cleaned and tmo going to pressure wash the siding and carport. Knocking out the punch list on the house slowly but surely.
7400 2018-10-13 22:29:36 Oh, as much as I'd love to, I just don't have the money, time, or equipment to handle that. I should learn to do things like oil changes, though.
7401 2018-10-13 22:29:29 Do you live in a bubble. Plastic oil and chemical spills have poisened our oceans. Your knit picking about what year an Iceberg will melt. I know a flat earther when I talk to one. Good night.
7402 2018-10-13 22:29:22 I think climbing a glass wall while covered in olive oil would be easier than teaching my 2yo to say please
7403 2018-10-13 22:29:13 Atiku has nothing to offer than to steal from the southern oil wells to make himself more rich,in other to keep Biafrans down
7404 2018-10-13 22:29:09 キャンプ張って登山もしてみたいなあ。
うちの場合はギアが車二台分で設営も撤収も10時間くらい掛かるので、一泊とかじゃ設営撤収で終わっちゃう…じゃあ連泊だ！のノリですw
7405 2018-10-13 22:28:50 Also my dad just brought me some Turkish olive oil clay soap from holiday and my skin has never felt this fresh. If you ever get chance to buy some, definitely do it. #skincare #turkishsoap
7406 2018-10-13 22:28:44 The bloody right wing ads (lies) on the radio are thick. Not surprisingly oil companies don’t think they should have to worry about the pesky environment because “jobs.” I know few slopers who actually have a residence here in last 25 years.
7407 2018-10-13 22:28:39 Very sad to google "greasy rat" and find people insulting each other, instead of pictures of rats that have gotten into the olive oil like I wanted.

7409 2018-10-13 22:28:28 CBD oil changed my life and my face, for real.
7410 2018-10-13 22:28:06 PSA: CBD oil can cause false positives for THC on drug tests. 
7411 2018-10-13 22:28:02 They ganged up against pmb because of their oil blocks were not given back to them. Regrouping of looters will not see the light of the day. After spending $16 billion dollars in power where is the light. Nonsense
7412 2018-10-13 22:28:01 I use some anti-frizz spray oil which I love, it lets me wear it down and not be embarrassed lol. But it’s freaking 80’s huge.
7413 2018-10-13 22:27:58 G4もニャンタークエくらいか
7414 2018-10-13 22:27:58 Well said Tommy, I'm working beside folks from Norway, They're a healthy, happy. well balanced bunch.  That would be us too were it not for our oil wealth's southern siphoning.  They do go through gallons of coffee though, a side effect worth having methinks. Norsk gu bràth 
7415 2018-10-13 22:27:54 COCONUT OIL WORKED OOOOO
7416 2018-10-13 22:27:42 Like to change the oil or just to add ?
7417 2018-10-13 22:27:32 can lowkey taste the oil in that shit 
7418 2018-10-13 22:27:30 When I worked at a pizza place we pre roasted the brussle sprouts with olive oil/ seasonings first then added onto the pizza with the rest of the uncooked ingredients
7419 2018-10-13 22:27:30 Also, the essential oil fad can go die. That shit doesn't work and is terrible for pets.
7420 2018-10-13 22:27:00 I hear you. When the government under Obama restricted oil drilling, it hit my family hard. My rentals wouldn't rent. So, I had to pay $1500 a month out of my own pocket. Wouldn't it be great if the government didn't have as much control over our lives as they do?
7421 2018-10-13 22:26:56 Just letting you know, US isn’t the biggest customer/buyer of saudi’s oil. So enough with that.
7422 2018-10-13 22:26:54 In this movie Black November, Akon and that Jean guy are actors. It's set in Nigeria. I landed on it and I hope this oil company stops raping the country. Also the corruption man. Cry beloved continent cry
7423 2018-10-13 22:26:51 The only thing Ryan has over her is he would be harder to hold on to because he wears more baby oil than her.
7424 2018-10-13 22:26:36 This man changing my oil fine as hell.......hold on nah.
7425 2018-10-13 22:26:33 If we phase out fossil fuels, we won’t need anyone’s oil

7427 2018-10-13 22:26:26 Why isnt KP using its oil and gas resources. We have a writer of chemistry book in Dr Atta ur Rehman.Cant we instal indigenous refineries and become energy generators in more than 1 way for the country
7428 2018-10-13 22:26:20 Take a look at the team working LSE right now . Oh how I'd like to get in to them lol. Theve got to fill the BB with shite. Don't let anyone know what's happened at #HORSEHILL 

Sunday night you guys need to get out and spread the news ;) #HORSEHILL  is MASSIVE!
7429 2018-10-13 22:26:09 me: *does literally nothing all day*
me at 3pm: *takes my fish oil/b12*
me to me: im so proud of u, child. you did so much today.
7430 2018-10-13 22:26:09 Simply beautiful original patina!  Don't change! Linseed oil!  Or clear coat! You can't improve on the SCARS!  Engine and interior that's ALL Thanks.
7431 2018-10-13 22:25:54 We’re not gonna need any oil soon at all. The energy sector’s future is changing and oil is not part of it.
7432 2018-10-13 22:25:50 Good to know thanks. Still a confusing choice given the high number of global companies ditching palm oil due to the environmental impact
7433 2018-10-13 22:25:46 If you’re making an excuse for murder with ‘except oil’ maybe you’re not a good person
7434 2018-10-13 22:25:37 Record high oil and gas production

Sit down Panda
7435 2018-10-13 22:25:32 If the price of oil includes blood and brutality, we should say no. We haven't always done that...
7436 2018-10-13 22:25:29 I’ll buy the oil but I think I’ll use the aloe gel from the plant thank youuu!
7437 2018-10-13 22:25:08 I want to oil paint but oil paints are so expensive:/
7438 2018-10-13 22:25:07 The sad irony that Michigan was once "Ground Zero" for hemp oil that Henry Ford wanted to use to power his motor vehicles. What a travesty.
7439 2018-10-13 22:24:11 No-one's tweeted me today, I'm bored, Give me something to read and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
7440 2018-10-13 22:24:04 Soon they will have no choice but shut-in the Oil. No business can sell its production at less than the cost of production and expect to stay in business. Temporarily, yes. Not for years on end. Then the government will be in trouble as they lose Oil royalties & can't fund things
7441 2018-10-13 22:24:04 hey i just smoked an oil for the first time going smacked 
7442 2018-10-13 22:24:03 I'm sorry you all have bought the snake oil he's been selling.
7443 2018-10-13 22:24:02 Today you can’t even get tiny Qatar in line, talking about giving lessons lol
So, today is not 45 years ago. Also you had the oil card to play now n then, but today the US is 1 step away from becoming the world’s largest oil producer and is an oil/LNG exporter too.
7444 2018-10-13 22:23:56 ah man you got some BooS lock mystery oil? lucky
7445 2018-10-13 22:23:45 They need the cheap oil..

7447 2018-10-13 22:23:26 I keep repeating to all who will listen, Nelson is a snake oil salesman! He has been screwing FL for many years. He is out for Senator Nelson, not citizens of The Sunshine State!

7460 2018-10-13 22:22:02 A CU/NOAA peer-reviewed scientific study found that more than half of the pollutants, such as propane, butane, other VOCs that contribute to ground level ozone formation, come from oil and gas operations. Erie's propane air levels were 10 times those of Pasadena, Calif.

Those thrilled are the oil and gas corporations.
7463 2018-10-13 22:21:49 I talk reality, not dreams.
show me 2 Oil producing country in this ear that have diversify for oil , that now majorly depend on non oil revenue ?
7464 2018-10-13 22:21:37 Meanwhile, the govt has allowed fracking to ensure increased supplies of cheap oil to cause both untold toxicity in our water courses, especially when they get flooded, & even more global warming. And the mad thing is, we pay them to make these decisions!
7465 2018-10-13 22:21:36 I think of this all the time.  We'd be 20 years ahead of the game.

How about if we'd stuck with fuel restrictions from the mid-70's oil crisis rather than going from that to the fat Reagan years?
7466 2018-10-13 22:21:35 Economic Recovery & Growth Plan means investing in Nigerians  as et al by Osinbajo...

And that recovery & growth plan means to bring down NGA from a country that is managing to the poorest so that during elections, 10k & 4k, onions & G. Oil will be invested in the people
7467 2018-10-13 22:21:22 Saudi has the oil. The same oil he said Russia it will become dependent on. He said they have to lower their prices we say stop using fossil fuels dumbass.
7468 2018-10-13 22:21:18 Yes! She said he’s doing it everyday but for him it’s not helping too much in public. They started cannabis oil and I guess that’s been incredibly helpful

7470 2018-10-13 22:21:12 .. also let's not forget that in the Middle East people pay for our oil with their lives .
7471 2018-10-13 22:21:10 For me, it took getting away from soap. Oil cleansing calmed my skin right down.
7472 2018-10-13 22:21:05 Surprised you have that much oil when you maxed out all their limit break.
7473 2018-10-13 22:21:03 And it explains the russian and saudi connection better if you factor in big oil.  

It's just more scary ....
7474 2018-10-13 22:21:02  BRAVO @KXAN_News 
Thank you for investigating these issues! 

I was VERY angry when Abbott appointed an oil baron to run Tx Parks and Wildlife Dept. Within weeks, he was trying to sneak a huge pipeline from Mexico across the pristine wilderness north of Big Bend. 
7475 2018-10-13 22:21:01 What’s up with the Oil D? Rangers beat themselves today.
7476 2018-10-13 22:20:56 Solar power will run out in 4 billion years, so let's use coal and oil instead!

7487 2018-10-13 22:19:07 I’m going to cheat a little and add truffle oil to mine. I tried mac and cheese with it the other day and thought how much better it would make macaroni pie. 
7488 2018-10-13 22:19:05 It is horrible what the production of this stuff costs our fellow creatures. However, I assume many things that vegans eat have a cost to others: fruit and nut farming? Vegans can try and eat less food with palm oil in but perhaps we should get more serious about endin production

7491 2018-10-13 22:18:48 Did oil go as low as 40?
7492 2018-10-13 22:18:42 try avocado oil next time, it's less toxic when at a high cooking temperature.

7494 2018-10-13 22:18:31 The Colorado Department of Labor and Statistics says the oil and gas industry in Colorado employed 23,500 in 2018. The U.S. government's Bureau of Economic Analysis says the oil and gas industry's GDP in 2016 was 2 percent of Colorado's total GDP.
7495 2018-10-13 22:18:27 There's always been a double standard from UK on Middle East politics. Stealing Iranian oil and over throwing the government in the 50s followed by a brutal dictator in the Shah. Open arms (geddit?) On the Saudis, Bahrainis, Kuwaitis etc... But why?
7496 2018-10-13 22:18:01 So...I think my sitting at a desk drawing for 10 years has finally caught up to me.

Last 2 days I've been waking up in utter pain in my upper back.  Headed over to my sister's so she can try to massage it out, but next step if it doesn't work is CBD oil. >.<
7497 2018-10-13 22:17:42 Wait we voted for him and he campaigned on this. That’s the people. That’s what we want. Climate leadership and looking to the future instead of shilling buck a beer snake oil. Stop worrying about nickels and dimes when there are serious problems. Or go home.

7506 2018-10-13 22:16:31 What about massive consumers of oil, like the US military? They consume oil, to protect oil, so that they have oil to consume to protect oil. Great plan guys, well done.
7507 2018-10-13 22:16:27 I JUST TOOK A SHIT

7508 2018-10-13 22:16:24 I would like to thank @mymonq for creating portable essential oil diffusers. I have never loved a product more than I love these 
7509 2018-10-13 22:16:13 The only way the demand for oil goes down to the point that would satisfy the anti oil crowd and or do anything to reduce carbon emissions is through abject poverty in the western world it may inadvertently happen then we will have more immediate worries

7516 2018-10-13 22:15:30 We need to wean ourselves off oil. The international scientific community confirmed this, the USA has the drive to innovate and a need for greater manufacturing output...why not green energy? Let the corrupt regimes of the middle East sink into the sand, like Ozymandias...

7527 2018-10-13 22:13:30 That is a bad thing. Oil need to score when Mcdavid is NOT on the ice. The win is a confidence booster but that is it. Time for everyone to step up.
7528 2018-10-13 22:13:22 Sorry you’re going through this, I went through it earlier this year so I can sympathise! I also recommend CBD oil if you think anxiety is the root of the issue, been taking it for a couple of weeks now (from @hempbynature) and it’s made a big difference to me x

Even better, make it plural. Essential oils. 
That way we can sell lots of really small portions for lots of money.

7536 2018-10-13 22:13:00 I gather from "huge" and "throttling" you reckon business as usual for oil, gas and coal's the right policy setting?
7537 2018-10-13 22:12:59 The oil producing states will explode and claim the ownership of the oil well
7538 2018-10-13 22:12:47 I mean, this is true, but obviously the point "renewable" depends on what timescale you mean. Oil is renewable, just on the scale of tens or hundreds of millions of years. Hell, the Sun itself is renewable on the scale of billions.

7543 2018-10-13 22:11:24 Honestly bc of the fact that lots of vegans buy palm oil it makes me want to focus on it even more....i don't buy palm oil at all, even sustainable palm oil. Because apparently that's not all its cracked up to be either. It's a lie like humane farming. At least from what I hear
7544 2018-10-13 22:11:13 I went on a salmon and chicken diet myself.  But almost any fish is ok.  It's really in the way you cook it.  Nothing fried, no matter how healthy the oil.  I became a huge reader of calories and sodium and other stats on the food I would eat.  It became almost an obsession.
7545 2018-10-13 22:11:12 Are they still spinning the lies about

Length of time to set up an independent Scotland?

Amount of money it would cost for the same?

Oil being a bonus?

Who Scotland's biggest trading partner is?

Not being aware of Salmond allegations untill this year?
7546 2018-10-13 22:11:10 Hahaha Someone trying to sell Atiku's snake oil talks of fake product. Good luck on that
7547 2018-10-13 22:11:10 Wait, so you’re saying all the job loss was about a Bush war? Not Obama over regulating? Not some fake stimulus package? Not Obama shutting down the energy industry? Making us rely on foreign oil.
7548 2018-10-13 22:11:08 The NIMBYs are pissed that Metro is ruining the bucolic charm of their school with the *checks notes* oil rig. Next stop: SB 827.
7549 2018-10-13 22:10:54 It's only growing "fasest" because you killed the oil patch, all it's associated jobs, economy and your Provincial Liberal Friends killed Ontario. It's like getting graded on a curve. Question how many minus 20 and 30 degrees days does BC get?
7550 2018-10-13 22:10:50 If we keep up the challenge it will help all those who need help.

As for speed of change - the campaign is doing the equivalent of turning a double sized oil tanker. So, we have to deal with inertia, momentum and strong currents & winds bent on maintaining the present direction.

7564 2018-10-13 22:09:28 I don't bring up Palm Oil to transitioning vegans, unless they are very eager and ask lots of questions and ask for advice etc. I bring it up to people who seem to already be vegan. So I agree

7566 2018-10-13 22:09:27 Got my new pumpkin creme brulee perfume oil from @bpal. Now I want to gnaw on my arm.
7567 2018-10-13 22:09:18 Hi our oil is collected by a registered company and then goes back to their Buinsess and is turned into bio diesel;))
7568 2018-10-13 22:09:11 It’s pretty amazing to me that the Esks and the Oil have the best player in their respective leagues and they’re both just... bad.

7572 2018-10-13 22:08:56 Thank you @FMat81859795 That is kind of you but I think I've jumped the gun, so to speak! I had thought that the article might be relevant but, because it is dated from 1932 it most likely post-dates Elwin's photo as the oil painting from it dates from 1931! 1/2
7573 2018-10-13 22:08:49 ever since I bought this lavender and orange essential body oil my body has been feeling so much better and I’ve been in a happy place 
7574 2018-10-13 22:08:27 Another major issue we have in Africa  is that we buy so much but never sell anything. All the money we make from oil we send it right back to the west once we buy cars, designer fashion and in trips abroad. It's not that we don't have money, we don't let the money circulate
7575 2018-10-13 22:08:23 Think about it ... 43 years of PC rule through the greatest economic oportunity in the last 80 years .... and at oil over $100 they had Alberta in perpetual deficit... one of the greatest economic disasters in Canadian history....
7576 2018-10-13 22:08:00 Wasn't iit to save your oil wells and businesses?
7577 2018-10-13 22:07:57 lmk how i dropped my car off for an oil change to pick it up and pay a $500 bill :)))))))

If market senses a Trudeau loss and not a NDP win , expect this sector to rally strongly in anticipation of positvie changes /legislation .  If market expecting a Trudeau win or minority = bad news , sector down more.
7593 2018-10-13 22:06:10 @FirestoneAuto I’ve been using your Delray location for 10 years. They just wasted my entire day (quoted 2-3 hours) and never even attempted to start the oil change on my car. No phone call or heads up. I’ll be telling everyone I know to never use you guys again
7594 2018-10-13 22:06:01 Powerful piece. Your head will not lack oil Sir.
7595 2018-10-13 22:05:41 Yeah, but Trump said he doesn’t want to lose the 110 billion dollar weapons contract so they will have to come up with some other punishment.  I say we stop buying their damn oil.

7599 2018-10-13 22:05:19 How do you recycle the palm oil please? Surprising and controversial choice of oil given that others have equally high flash points, is thee a particular reason given the global impact?
7600 2018-10-13 22:04:58 The war on drugs failed because it focused on the producers and did little, ( "just say no") to reduce usage. Without a reduction in oil usage, reducing Canadian production will only end up enriching producers whose social values and commitment to the environment is far less.
7601 2018-10-13 22:04:52 Dígale a @exxonmobil y a @DubaiPlan2021  que tan improductivas son las rentas de Oil & Gas
7602 2018-10-13 22:04:50 Because GEJ stole instead of laying foundation.
The Shell scandal of 1.3b$
Atlantic Oil and Seven Energy scandal with NPDC worth billions of $ SLS raised alarm and was sacked!
These are monies for developmental projects.
1.2b$ arms money and the list goes on.
7603 2018-10-13 22:04:46 Don't be fooled. @ScottMorrisonMP's Government doesn't hog all the moral bankruptcy.
Great that @NZNationalParty supports the #zerocarbonbill ...but they also plan to undo much of the present Government's #climate initiatives when next elected. Strong support of oil/gas industry.

7618 2018-10-13 22:03:10 So you must be livid at all oil companies and refineries that buy that oil when ethical options exist.

Why are you not picketing the Irving refinery? 

Energy East was an export pipeline that would have done nothing to displace foreign imports
#nationalize
7619 2018-10-13 22:03:09 but if you are arguing that retirement age hike could been avoided if economy better run and better use had been made of oil money re growth inducing investment etc. then I would agree with you.. 

still.. 55yrs is insanely low. its not a pension. its a subsidy.

7626 2018-10-13 22:02:10 In an era where we are seeing the dangers of over dependence on oil and the increasing efforts to diversify the economy, you are still talking about increasing oil production?

7654 2018-10-13 21:58:35 He is a real piece of work. Did you see him in the debate vs. Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry? Fry referred to Dyson's style as "huckstering snake oil pulpit talk" and it was too perfect.
7655 2018-10-13 21:58:29 It’s the palm oil you need to consider. Guess which gorgeous orange animals habitat is destroyed as a result ?
7656 2018-10-13 21:58:21 Remember when our oil was nationalized and the Reform Party, which is now the Conservatives, railed against it?
7657 2018-10-13 21:58:07 Also saudi Arabia is the biggest state sponsor of terror in the world and a repressive oil monarchy that regularly executes people for being gay, not sure theres a moral case for why we need to he a bulwark against their enemies
7658 2018-10-13 21:57:57 I’m so sorry to hear this, but I am glad that your husband survived.  It’s sad and sickening to think about how many people suffered so much, whilst he was sat safely in one of his palatial homes being protected by armed police.  He lied about Saddam Hussein -it was all about oil

7661 2018-10-13 21:57:52 We would be much better off with a pipeline to tidewater to get 30M more dollars a day for our oil with no extra production. Invest that in renewables.  Not a carbon tax that hurts people. I believe its u that doesn't understand sir.

During the ref 2014 it was running out by the end of the decade 7 days later HW developed tech to extract to end of the century. Since then more has been discovered and the West coast hasn't even been explored due to Trident
7669 2018-10-13 21:56:37 Not so much. People saw what they wanted to see with Hall. Yes he would turnover the puck at times, as do many of the best players in the league. Too many tend to forget how much he created & produced.

7681 2018-10-13 21:55:27 Our experts will ensure of its benefits and if no side effects, it will surely join the list of healthy oils. Good to know it’s heat threshold.. reason I use coconut oil, does not oxidise unless heated over 300dfh. The way I heat it, it remains sort of raw..
7682 2018-10-13 21:55:13 Oil rig workers spend 6 months on a rig max because of the radiation they are exposed to. You want to bring that radiation onshore, into our communities. If you had the ambition to divest you'd be investing in @AbundanceInv and @sheffieldrenew and not holidaying like me.

7701 2018-10-13 21:52:56 I always said that, after 9/11, Bush SHOULD have told the Saudis, "You help us find and apprehend Osama bin Laden, or you'll find the 101st Airborne landing in Riyadh, and you're not going to like it. Screw your oil." Forget punching at Iraq. That's what SHOULD have happened.

7714 2018-10-13 21:51:38 If we have do much oil why I'd it going up on price? Is it because they want to force us into electric cars?
7715 2018-10-13 21:51:34 A friend of mine in chronic pain from bad accident swears on hemp oil for pain relief! Don’t know myself!
7716 2018-10-13 21:51:33 Anyone in Canada that tries to defend buying oil from anywhere but Canada, doesn’t give a shit about the environment or human rights. About time this country put Canadians first. #energyeast

Asking for a country.
7718 2018-10-13 21:51:19 You fail to realise that the saudi owns 80% of the oil that runs your cars and keeps you warm with heating, Making an enemy of the saudis what you gonna do with out fuel for Cars. Think about that next time you use that as an agruement
7719 2018-10-13 21:51:16 Tacit - not so tacit - approval for killing a journalist. This administration is beyond bankrupt. They have the morals of snake oil salesmen peddling arsenic-laced dog biscuits to widows.

I have Denali 2015

I went to your agent in Saudi Arabia
I asked about change of gearbox oil
They said:
According to your recommendations
It is not recommended to change transmission oil from the 2015 substitutes. The eight transmission

I was surprised by?!

I hope the Oil works. It really is time for medical marihuana to be legalized
7729 2018-10-13 21:50:29 @realDonaldTrump your sanctions, Mr President,  against Iran are useless because Chinese replace Westeners in Iran and they buy their oil
7730 2018-10-13 21:50:22 No I'm not. Just finished a random painting so I'm covered in oil paint that won't come off. No way am I getting it on my controller  most likely will tomorrow though

7749 2018-10-13 21:48:37 SA will not lose value as higher prices compensate the lower production in the other hand US will not be able to replace SA oil easily and US consumers will then realize the need for SA
In terms of SA need for US higher education, we can replace it 2

7754 2018-10-13 21:48:06 but this causes outsourcing of oil and other fossil fuels where residents don’t have as much of a say — if any! — in what happens  to their living environment
7755 2018-10-13 21:47:53 yes their immediate environment, theres oil in north america that is rarely dug up because environmentalists in respective areas oppose it; they don’t want to deal with the negative impact that would cause on their immediate environment (which i don’t think is wrong)

7759 2018-10-13 21:47:16 And that they were working with her before the NDP were even a thought here? Naw, he’s not forgetting it, he’s intentionally leaving it out because it provides context that blows his narrative (and the “Notley hates oil” one too) all to hell! #ALieByOmission is still a lie Jason!
7760 2018-10-13 21:47:02 It’s ruthless over there...it’s why we need to quit buying their oil...Trump is trying to make us an energy exporter...glad we have a Real Man as President..and he did not have to send pallets of cash to get the pastor out of Turkey

7770 2018-10-13 21:44:33 US purchases Saudi Oil through Saudi enterprises in the US and despite that US might be producing more oil nowadays though SAs are an integral part in stabilizing oil prices. Saudi can simply reduce it production by one million(SA oil sold to US)prices will go up dramatically 1

7774 2018-10-13 21:43:53 I have a slipped disc in my spine and a right hip labral tear so I am quite familiar with the importance of strengthening the back muscles. I am waiting for a shipment of CDB oil in the mail to see if that helps me. I am sick of the prescriptions the hospitals give.
7775 2018-10-13 21:43:49 I never understood our country’s continued embrace of Saudi Arabia after most of the 9/11 hijackers came from there. Bush/Cheney - yes. They ignored it because of oil and money. But the country at large? So weird.
7776 2018-10-13 21:43:48 So we'll go from selling our oil at a stiff discount to America to selling our oil at a stiff discount to india?

Lovely, and the green party is the only party that wants domestic oil refining you say?
7777 2018-10-13 21:43:47 I’m sure he could have thrown in some of the cannabis oil with the attention
7778 2018-10-13 21:43:21 I have heard it hundreds of times.

7788 2018-10-13 21:41:55 And why is this important?  The Kardashian clan are the snake oil salespersons of our era.  Toxic and fake.
7789 2018-10-13 21:41:47 Such is the situation as it is today. It will likely get worse before it gets better. The tail of oil now wags the dog of the United States, the whole of the Arab world cowering in the corner, Israel becoming it's mortal enemy's shade. These inversions generally don't last.

7793 2018-10-13 21:41:34 This is incorrect. Their influence is that they are a regional power, with oil reserves, who spends 10% of GDP on defense, checks Iranian influence, and holds a ton of influence in GCC, OPEC, and other regional bodies. Also not sure you know what great power competition is.

7812 2018-10-13 21:39:01 There oil reserves are running out. No one knows how much they have left.  The Saudis will not let anyone close to finding out. This is the reason the Saudis want to get into different ventures, like space.
7813 2018-10-13 21:38:52 Well..he got a huge amount for his inauguration from foreign entities. Probably funneled through Suadi Arabia judging that he went there first as opposed to our closest allies whom he has shunned. He has allowed for Saudi Oil to become expensive again.
7814 2018-10-13 21:38:43 US = 25%. UK = 60% share, & that is what everything else is about. US leverage is that oil is traded in dollars, as opposed to pre-Suez Sterling. Russian/ME aren't players. Everything is about old money [Europe - Monarchy/Rothsteins] versus new money [US - Rockefellers/Bush etc]
7815 2018-10-13 21:38:41 Avoid the 2017-2018. Big issue unsolved, oil mixing in gasoline and vehicles dying on the road or highway. I own a 2014 and love it, even has a real transmission and not a belt to drive the wheels (CVT) , but would not touch a 2015-2018 for both the CVT transmission and oil issue

7820 2018-10-13 21:38:05 The Saudis lost the title "Protectors of the Arabs" - traded in cheaply for "Western Lackeys" who buy jets and bombs. Rather than use oil profits for the enrichment their people and the Arab world, and the region generally, the program insists they buy weapons, and use them.

7826 2018-10-13 21:36:54 Everybody always says “hook it up with an oil change” but nobody ever says “I’ll pay for your oil change”
7827 2018-10-13 21:36:47 You're "BUILD"ing a wall. 
No investments from SA?  Next step is no imports (e.g. oil) from SA. Then no immigration from SA.
That's Nationalism. Congrats. You just took the first steps toward destroying Globalism.

7831 2018-10-13 21:36:14 @realDonaldTrump what’s with Saudi Arabia? 911 bombers were from Saudi Arabia. So we reward them by selling them arms? Is there oil  really that important? #SaudiArabia

7847 2018-10-13 21:33:54 5% would scratch the surface with our costs and quantity of people here.  Again, it only works there because they have 5 million people and because of their oil.  That's it.  And even then, it's not sustaining.    You people who keep pointing at Norway as the model are ignorant.

7849 2018-10-13 21:33:14 yeah so i mean, go hog wild

i also used to wash my hair with bar soap which was probably *really bad for my hair* but definitely cut down on the amount of oil my scalp was producing

7852 2018-10-13 21:32:43 so the secret is i used Aldi pumpkin bread box mix, 2 cups oats, half a bag BIG chips, a couple spoonfuls of pumpkin butter, and extra clove, nutmeg and cinn. Also i do that box mix trick w/ switching oil for butter and water for milk!
7853 2018-10-13 21:32:08 Virtually all of us are aware of breast cancer. How about awareness of proper nutrition via education (i.e., #WFPB #Vegan low/no salt/oil/sugar WOE), for cancer (& most other diseases) prevention, and to save our beloved Mother Earth (including the animals)?

What a day. ADAMS OUT. #pafc

7866 2018-10-13 21:30:00 Coconut oil is not the fix, if you can believe it.
7867 2018-10-13 21:29:56 I’m ready to watch Hugo and Kingfisher basketball . The time of year where I get like 5 oil changes in a 3 month span traveling 
7868 2018-10-13 21:29:48 Afterwards they are poured off a gladiator's wound, is good to clouds, the volumes of all, and similarly obscured by oil,

7870 2018-10-13 21:29:44 I just got a oil change & KoKo sounding good already.
7871 2018-10-13 21:29:44 Nobody wants your oil bud. Its dirty, all the big clients have better quality oil, much closer at hand. Face facts. You cant give away your crappy bitumen at $16. Leave it in the ground. Find some other line of work.

Example.

In oil and gas industry polutend gas treated separately
7878 2018-10-13 21:29:07 I'm not a man nor do I work in the oil industry. I became interested in the industry and politics to relieve boredom while on parental leave.
7879 2018-10-13 21:28:59 How much do you tip for a oil change? 
7880 2018-10-13 21:28:53 We should not be part of an oil or gas well in Los Angeles:
7881 2018-10-13 21:28:53 Hey copywriters burning the Saturday oil: I see you. Lo-fi hip-hop radio helps.

7883 2018-10-13 21:28:40 It’s even better if you take the oil droppers
7884 2018-10-13 21:28:38 Saudi is much more important for their influence in the region and intel sharing than their oil. Unfortunately, to your other points, this is how great power competition has occurred throughout history. US, Rus, and China will continue to compete, and much will involve proxies.
7885 2018-10-13 21:28:18 As a canadian I apologize for that poison, I mean canola oil. Wish that crap was banned. I tell people every day that it's garbage.  Butter, lard and coconut oil is what I cook with

7887 2018-10-13 21:28:13 Historically, but USA is now the largest producer of oil @ 14.68 million b/d
7888 2018-10-13 21:28:10 Yes, we should work towards renewable energy, agreed.  However, when there is demand out there for oil,  and we have plenty of them, it is better us than them to supply it. We are greener than most of others in the industry. Don't you think so?
7889 2018-10-13 21:28:05 You have the makings of a great essential oil blooper reel here.
7890 2018-10-13 21:28:05 That man controls the majority of shares in British oil company, Shell petroleum.

She winks.
7892 2018-10-13 21:27:59 It appears that the liberal government is playing both sides of the issue only to get what they really want, shut down Alberta oil sand and do irreparable damage to the Canadian economy.

7896 2018-10-13 21:27:26 Just found out how many young people don't know how to drive stick. This cat at the oil shop needed his co worker to pull my car in 
7897 2018-10-13 21:27:24 Lmao I’m getting my oil changed. Bro don’t talk to me if you’re under 22 
7898 2018-10-13 21:27:23 The day their oil is as worthless as their sand cannot come soon enough.
7899 2018-10-13 21:27:10 currently sitting in a quick oil with three knives in my purse happy saturday 
7900 2018-10-13 21:27:04 Exactly!! THE OIL EXECS ASKED FOR HER. They conveniently jump over the truth.
7901 2018-10-13 21:26:56 Lol. If I new when they were coming.
7902 2018-10-13 21:26:44 With all due respect, we must think about power systems and how they operate in the world. #Israel functions as a final guarantor of access to and theft of oil resources in the Middle East - all of the supporting ideology is just a convenience and basis for manipulation.
7903 2018-10-13 21:26:39 Not even oil money. Gun money. The Saudis buy billions worth of American weapons every year.
7904 2018-10-13 21:26:34 My sister!!! Spaghetti 200, better Titus fish 250 fresh pepper and tomatoes 100 , cray fish 50, Egg 100 I dey hope say den get oil, onions Maggi and salt for house. If them no get he go remove egg and crayfish take buy. FOOD AFF DONE!
7905 2018-10-13 21:26:30 Even if there were a rump group that wants to get off oil and gas, the ministries and NEB in charge of the exploitation are not even hinting that they have any intention to reduce the extraction or the reliance on oil and gas for primary energy in Canada out until 2040 at least.
7906 2018-10-13 21:26:11 I guess people in the northeast should freeze to death this winter. Can’t have home heating oil. Oh wait there’s coal....oh....yeah.....sorry, they’re just have to freeze. 
7907 2018-10-13 21:26:07 The media are angry,why? There is no more free money from the government.
-The Ex generals are murmuring, Why? There is no sign President Buhari will renew their oil blocks contract.
-Social cultural groups are grumbling, Why? No more Ghana must go bags of money to support Buhari
7908 2018-10-13 21:26:06 if it’s leaking oil, it still has oil

7911 2018-10-13 21:25:30 The oil holds itself to a high ethical standard.
7912 2018-10-13 21:25:26 Totally agree. @theSNP didn’t mention a Yes vote would have led to Scotland leaving the EU, they exaggerated the revenues from oil and said they were a competent government when performance of schools, nhs and transport says otherwise
7913 2018-10-13 21:25:08 ok so i agree that palm oil is horrible and we should all try our best to avoid it but it shouldn’t be considered non vegan (yet...????) because it would make veganism seem less accessible and more restrictive. thoughts????
7914 2018-10-13 21:25:06 "It`s soft and... big and you shall use it to rub it with oil on my... body~! Hah."
7915 2018-10-13 21:24:50 Sh*t, like oil will always find its own level
7916 2018-10-13 21:24:30 U r are nothing without saudi's oil big jerk
7917 2018-10-13 21:24:28 Oil companies want it.
7918 2018-10-13 21:24:13 She has endured a great deal of hate and misogyny which does not help matters and the fact that the overarching policy remains to extract as much oil and gas as possible before the markets collapse makes it doubly difficult. Is there are real schism in the Liberal camp?
7919 2018-10-13 21:24:01 True but that goes both ways. An oil embargo of China by the USN via the strait of malacca is a killshot the PRC has no easy answer to as is targeted cyber and financial warfare. China is dealable but it requires a bit of domestic housecleaning
7920 2018-10-13 21:23:51 Why do words burn so much like shit, hot popcorn oil drips on my skin every other day and it’s whatever.  Yet you say one sentence and I’m stuck on it for the whole week.

7926 2018-10-13 21:23:14 A plant based oil based lubricant (ie: coconut oil or similar) will last a little longer under water. (assuming your body reacts well to oil based lubes). 

Or silicone lube if the dildo in question isn't also made of silicone.
7927 2018-10-13 21:23:13 Damn Right, don't give Europe a pass.  Germany is making lots of weapons for the war machine, as are the Swiss.  
And why do you think you are figting Europe's Oil Wars?   Hint, look at the word before Oil.
No surprise that Germany is not developing electric vehicles.
7928 2018-10-13 21:23:13 "Keeping America Safe"
I think you meant to say "securing our oil supply" in places where we had no business.
7929 2018-10-13 21:23:12 And we all know Saudi’s will not be our allies once their oil runs out. We need answers for the murder of #khashoogi #HumanRights

7933 2018-10-13 21:22:40 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for amethyst dildos, and put some lavender essential oil in my diffuser.
7934 2018-10-13 21:22:32 Is that a real picture?
7935 2018-10-13 21:22:31 Oil ?
7936 2018-10-13 21:22:30 Ethical oil?  Is that like clean coal?
7937 2018-10-13 21:22:22 The Saudis murdered this journalist in cold blood chopped him up at the consulate and sent the pieces back to Saudi but yet Saudi knows that Trump nor anyone else that depends on Saudi money and oil will do anything.
7938 2018-10-13 21:22:22 Just do a safe smudging and to cover your bases throw some holy oil up on the doorways. You’ll be fine.

7944 2018-10-13 21:21:27 Mat, here is some food for thought. Look at a list of what comes from oil products, then cut everyone of them out of your life. That includes things like iPhones and computers since their shipped in, then demand everyone else to do so.

Maybe they are servicing too many loans; plus corruption.

7950 2018-10-13 21:20:54 I am not generalising. There is always a beginning if you speak of arms sales. It's a change in trend and signal. If you speak of oil sales the scale is correct. China is the major oil client of Saudis today. Russia, China military equipment now very competitive & high quality.
7951 2018-10-13 21:20:35 Hello! For this recipe it calls for:
16 drops Orange Sweet
10 drops Copaiba Oleoresin
10 drops Silver Fir
8 drops Vanilla Oleoresin
6 drops Chamomile Roman
¼ cup Beeswax Pellets
3 tbsp Coconut Oil
7952 2018-10-13 21:20:33 I'd at least fancy it up with Rosemary and Olive oil flavour.
7953 2018-10-13 21:20:29 Hall was a turnover king with Oil! Difference was in jersey game, hall never drove the play it was their forechecking that killed Oil

When she heard massages,she forgot what she said.

"Your oil massages you mean? Yes please!"
7955 2018-10-13 21:20:07 What is happening to the Germany machines? They should do something about the oil seal (Ozil). The engine (midfield) is leaking.
7956 2018-10-13 21:20:04 The Heartland Institute @HeartlandInst probably got good dollar for this from Big Oil...

7959 2018-10-13 21:19:16 As I understood her position, it was that the demand side is where Canada needs to start (even though we import all our finished petroleum products), and the mechanism is to be a modest carbon tax, but not on our extracted oil and gas because that would hamper sales.
7960 2018-10-13 21:19:10 We do not. That was explained to you already. The difference between what is imported in the East and exported in the West was also explained. Your market to China doesn’t ruin Vancouver in the process, especially when it’s only about selling oil to Asia for oil companies.

7962 2018-10-13 21:18:53 Oil no longer important. The owners want to extract as much money as they can. Times are changing and they lose

7964 2018-10-13 21:18:46 just made my first bougie oil and vinegar purchase. it took 45 minutes to find the right match.
7965 2018-10-13 21:18:31 if it's leaking oil it still has oil so it's fine
7966 2018-10-13 21:18:31 But at least it’s OUR fossil fuel Dennis. You already killed coal... and North Sea oil, Southern gas. With Solar subsidies!! So we have to buy gas from Russia and Norway for next 50 years. At least try to mitigate some pain, before we end up burning dried cow shit ... again
7967 2018-10-13 21:18:25 The mechanic that just took my car in for an oil change just covered his face with his shirt, as soon as he got in my car. Buddy boy can’t handle the smell of some loud

7969 2018-10-13 21:18:04 @walmarthelp walmart in loganville auto dept is terrible, been waiting 3 hours to get an oil change, took 30 minutes for them to even greet me at the oil bay, never will I come back, still waiting, they have taken all the oil out, still haven't put oil in, such bs
7970 2018-10-13 21:17:57 This arch bishop that was the head of a multinational oil company when buhari was the head of state.... Stupid brit!
7971 2018-10-13 21:17:47 ...except to keep oil prices low - and arns sales HIGH..
7972 2018-10-13 21:17:45 Don’t be too optimistic about getting a discount on CBD oil now you hurt his feelings
7973 2018-10-13 21:17:44 What kind of oil is that

7977 2018-10-13 21:17:30 So it's those companies emitting the gases. Not the consumers. Yes, the consumers consuming leads to those companies emitting, but those companies will still emit regardless of consumption. And it'd still be a tiny amount compared to what oil companies emit
7978 2018-10-13 21:17:17 Actually, you can make a corn quesadilla much like a flour quesadilla, but the caveat is you have to put a bit of oil in the skillet and put the heat on a bit more like griddling it, so it’s a bit greasy but really good.
7979 2018-10-13 21:17:07 I got my CBD Kit!!!!!!  Strawberry oil, Cream, and a hand full of Gummies!!!

7988 2018-10-13 21:15:40 No, that’s you creating this narrative. It’s only about continually loading oil tankers at Westridge (a seismic area) and hauling 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge through North America’s 3rd most densely populated city and over an extremely sensitive ecosystem.
7989 2018-10-13 21:15:35 Nigga ain’t change a lick of oil stay woke 
7990 2018-10-13 21:15:30 I love tea tree oil
7991 2018-10-13 21:15:23 - Oh no, the carrot oil fucks my skin up i have to have the one with coconut. Although you need a good base tan to use oil.
7992 2018-10-13 21:15:23 Man I had to use the shea moisture black castor oil shampoo & that shit stinks so bad to me .
7993 2018-10-13 21:15:08 We demonstrated that the current oil subsidy would be quite sufficient to begin a planned transition and that nuclear, wind, solar and geo energy sources are all appropriate in different areas. She suggested the subsidies were largely with the provinces, not the feds.
7994 2018-10-13 21:15:07 While this might be the future I don't think we are there yet. In the meantime Oil will be needed as will be coal by some countries. It's all a process of small steps. Some small steps folks don't want to do like @jkenney and @OilGasCanada But I guess they choose money over life.
7995 2018-10-13 21:15:07 [walks downstairs from a nap, starts drinking Diet Squirt from a 2-liter]

Okay so clearly the Dinotrucks used massive amounts of oil and gas due to their size, but they also lived in a time before fossil fuels existed which makes this show really unbelievable in my opinion.
7996 2018-10-13 21:14:44 Does not have advanced degrees .And his $ comes from his grandfathers investments in Irving oil,,so carbon tax that
7997 2018-10-13 21:14:43 The last time Labour were in Govt it lied its baws aff about WMD's in Iraq, killing millions for oil dollar, 70s had plans to steal NSO, in the 90s took 6000 miles of Scots sea, and if in power again will still prevent oil on the Clyde.

I think I know what oil means to Labour.
7998 2018-10-13 21:14:39 Wholesale price of oil is falling, but the damagewas already done ages back. Venezuela failed to develop other manufacturing industries and now they don’t produce enough goods domestically. Just bad management.

8005 2018-10-13 21:13:39 "bad for your health" = BS

Hitler's decisions wrt Dunkirk and Moscow vs oil fields are only explainable as intentional
=> Hitler was British agent & TGSNT = BS.

#QAnon is well informed; works with DJT; 
moreover Merkel looks 100% like Hitler
more likely clone than daughter.
8006 2018-10-13 21:13:18 Sad. Angola is a major oil & gas producer.

8008 2018-10-13 21:13:04 Checking Iranian influence in the Middle East, creating a US-bloc in the ME with the Gulf states (MESA) to check Russian-led bloc, has helped off-set oil shortfalls caused from Iranian sanctions (increases oil production at critical times) just to name a few. They do matter.
8009 2018-10-13 21:13:03 Had the worst experience today at Wimpy(Kimberley- North-Cape Mall). I was wondering why we were the only people there; little did I know that we were gonna be served green steak with chips that looked like they were dipped in oil before they were served!

8012 2018-10-13 21:12:52 * 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons of virgin coconut oil
Brown sugar sloughs off dead skin while coconut oil packs it with moisture. The result? A soft and glowy finish.
8013 2018-10-13 21:12:47 i got Legal Weed Oil so hopefully that helps at all
8014 2018-10-13 21:12:42 Cannabis oil will do the trick and protect the body from radiation.
8015 2018-10-13 21:12:30 * 2 tablespoons of pure honey
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 1 wedge of fresh lemon
Cinnamon is known to reduce inflammation and redness—plus, it sops up excess oil when applied topically.
8016 2018-10-13 21:12:24 Oh I had no idea that there were large oil deposits and natural resources there in the Ukraine that explains it. The damn capitalists who own everything just can't get enough to satisfy their ridiculous greed! And are willing to allow disadvantaged youth to die for it! Damn

8019 2018-10-13 21:12:08 . . . but Putin does. The Saudis seem to be willing partners in the schemes to prop up the price of oil which you know better than anyone . . . is Putin’s life blood!
#PutinsPuppet #tRUmpRUssia #teamtreason
8020 2018-10-13 21:11:55 I’d replace changing the oil in the car with learning to do laundry, but I agree with this idea. They also need to know how to open a saving account, cautions about credit card debt & how to manage a monthly budget.
8021 2018-10-13 21:11:33 Cut a pumpkin in half, scoop out seeds, cover all over inside layer with thin layer of oil, salt and pepper using your hands. Stick on baking tray or straight on  oven rack and roast (with other veg, beets, onion, peppers, cauli, garlic whatever) until looks burnt on outside.
8022 2018-10-13 21:11:20 Arms sales by US is no more a US leverage on Saudi Arabia because now Saudis can also buy from Russia, China as missile negotiations with Russia show. Also, US now is a major oil competitor to Saudi Arabia rather than a major client. China replaced US for Saudi oil.
8023 2018-10-13 21:11:14 I wanted to make cupcakes bUT THERES NO OIL :((
8024 2018-10-13 21:10:59 no dont look at him..just listen to the words.
8025 2018-10-13 21:10:57 My dear Tunde. Govt is not making enough money and if it does not borrow, things will really really be worse. Oil revenue dropped seriously and is still not where it was under PDP. Govt has not reduced staff because it will affect people. The borrowing is for infrastructure.
8026 2018-10-13 21:10:57 Vaping cbd oil...good for anxiety and depression?

8029 2018-10-13 21:10:41 And be armed with things you’ll take INSTEAD of a price reduction (like two years of oil changes or an extended warranty)
8030 2018-10-13 21:10:37 And of course I fully understand that. And we pay far more as a country, for the oil that arrives East than we get for shipping it south. That should be a national issue. Energy East would have corrected.  you want to deny AB access to world market to the west also.
8031 2018-10-13 21:10:33 Charbroil TRU oil less fryer
8032 2018-10-13 21:10:31 You are indeed an anonymous troll and you also have no idea about current world demand for oil.
8033 2018-10-13 21:10:28 InshaAllah I'll be there.
8034 2018-10-13 21:10:06 No, you would need changes in column CO2 at least 10x higher to separate dT from other factors. You can get such a dT signal by burning crude oil in large pots at night. This is what citrus farmers did to keep crops warm by creating a blanket of pollution to trap heat near ground

8037 2018-10-13 21:09:55 There's an Egyptian dish I grew up on called Foole Madamas. Its fava beans, tomato, onion, cumin, lemon, garlic, olive oil and pita and it's a lovely high protein vegan healthy breakfast. 
8038 2018-10-13 21:09:50 Thank you @TulsiGabbard for your anti-war voice!  War has become just a revenue generator for the US government and elite.  Every human life is worth more than a drop of oil or a dollar.
8039 2018-10-13 21:09:46 Are you going to show Rachel the work in progress? It was mesmerising, apart from the nuln oil moment. Which was basically funny if you watched the last hour first as I did. And if you weren't the one cleaning up. You should show her ;-)
8040 2018-10-13 21:09:46 We pay for all you benefits police defence NHS education in fact all of those things you think your oil pays for infant comes from taxes from the south east of England
8041 2018-10-13 21:09:40 The $400 billion was actually earned in 6years of GEJ from oil alone. Over a trillion US dollars may have been earned in 16 years of pdp!

8044 2018-10-13 21:09:21 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

8049 2018-10-13 21:08:50 Notley is against pipelines and Alberta oil..just like Trudeau so she can stop pretending anytime now.
8050 2018-10-13 21:08:48 Yet, he was. He was involved in the failed attempt to kill Hitler.
With your logic, none of the founding fathers is honorable either, or anyone who fought in Iraq for the US after 9/11, since it was based on a false premise (WMD), and getting oil resources for a few companies.
8051 2018-10-13 21:08:31 There is not fossil fuel, our fuel comes from the gasses that compress under the crust of becomes oil, for gas from the bubbles, from the boiling magma...plus, co2 is plantffood.

8054 2018-10-13 21:08:25 @realDonaldTrump Sorry, but break of a $110 B investment means retake of control of oil market by US and trillions on incomes. By 2030 thanks to incomes from oil market US can reduce its deficit to 100 B and to $0 by 2050.

8059 2018-10-13 21:07:36 Could a US and Russian led oil alliance mitigate Saudi petrodollar influence?
8060 2018-10-13 21:07:34 Between 21,000 BC and 5,000 BC sea levels rose by 120 metres. No human industry, no human use of coal, oil or gas, and with CO2 levels far below today's levels.

Humans - we can survive as a species in a fast warming world - although human civilisation may not.
8061 2018-10-13 21:07:28 They look happy. I wonder if more oil tanker traffic would make them happy too?

8071 2018-10-13 21:06:05 Fewer studies, but it too is a industrial seed oil. One of the biggest issues with soybean, canola, corn, grapeseed, safflower, etc. is the amount of omega-6 you get with them. Best to stick to olive, butter, coconut, avocado, even palm. Stick to old ways! Lindy!

Maybe more profits? In any case, I doubt that innovation will save the day. Oil use will decline with innovation

8086 2018-10-13 21:04:20 Just remember, Conservatives were thrilled that Canada was dependent on the American market. They invited US senators to the oil sands, loved Ezra Levant's pro-US market "ethical oil" propaganda. Stephen Harper pushed Keystone XL. Now things have changed...

Alexa: "I'd rather not answer that."

Uh.. Alexa, that's not how this works.
8092 2018-10-13 21:03:18 Why don’t you be the first, and quit using devices that are made of and/or using oil and gas in their production and distribution?
8093 2018-10-13 21:03:07 And we provide your oil. Whats your point?
8094 2018-10-13 21:03:05 But the establishment left is perfectly fine with Islamic fascist oil coming but our oil cant be developed because of their delusional paranoia about a non harmful life giving gas they wrongly claim is harmful they make me sick with their double standards

8103 2018-10-13 21:01:48 All of y'all wrong. It's cod liver oil or nothing.
8104 2018-10-13 21:01:42 Imagine, the Oil Province not wanting taxes on oil production. What’s next, a trip to Quebec to talk about not taxing poutine?
8105 2018-10-13 21:01:40 Did you take any classes to learn how to be a snake oil salesman? Or were you born this way?
8106 2018-10-13 21:01:35 개짱나....
8107 2018-10-13 21:01:29 Nothing moving about sham religion. When will “reputable” journalists stop helping this man sell snake oil?
8108 2018-10-13 21:01:28 u like gin, u love juniper berry oil.
8109 2018-10-13 21:01:28 I always leave getting an oil change till the last minute now my car is out here crying for maintenance
8110 2018-10-13 21:01:26 早起きさんだね！！えらい！！！！
8111 2018-10-13 21:01:18 LOL, no water,  no grain, no oil or gas and how does that map change?  Be dulusional if you like.  Those measurements include overseas exports, and are dependand of the production from the middle of the county.

8114 2018-10-13 21:00:58 Once again, the St. Lawrence is in Eastern Canada. The TMP runs West from Edmonton to Burnaby. Twinning the line to Westridge in Burnaby has nothing to do with oil tankers in the St. Lawrence. That one was called Energy East. The TMP and Energy East are unrelated.
8115 2018-10-13 21:00:55 Saudi Prince know Trump will do nothing not even jawbone. He talks tough but knows he is owned and is in debt to the Prince. They got USA over barrels of oil and cash
8116 2018-10-13 21:00:54 What kind of oil is this?
8117 2018-10-13 21:00:49 Just dragged oil pan out bae's driveway... Lmao I'm fuckin' up 
8118 2018-10-13 21:00:43 Indian people not like your sugetion  not to take kud oil iran
8119 2018-10-13 21:00:40 Bargains? Bargains for what? She had strong opinions against oil. It was no secret. “Energy” companies wanted her there. If someone like her isn’t there, it would be a joke. More entitlement.
8120 2018-10-13 21:00:12 #Bargah know that the big oil companies are in their interest to keep the regime in Libya central because the oil fields are free and therefore not forced to compensate the production areas. This is a serious mistake if the companies tried to talk to us, try to talking #Bargah
8121 2018-10-13 21:00:11 The oil simply allows a stronger dictatorship to emerge once democracy is broken. Marxists destroy everything they touch @elfel1
8122 2018-10-13 21:00:11 October 13, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
8123 2018-10-13 21:00:09 coconut oil does wonders for my hair 
8124 2018-10-13 21:00:00 The widow went and did what Elijah said. So the widow, Elijah, and the widow’s household ate for many days. The jar of flour didn’t decrease nor did the bottle of oil run out, just as the Lord spoke through Elijah. - 1 Kings 17:15-16
8125 2018-10-13 20:59:53 for MONTHS i've been hearing this repetitive whistle on the street at certain times  at fist i thought it was a parrot and when i asked my parents they never told what it was or they said "oh they must be the oil factory" but that is VERY far away and that can't be it.....
8126 2018-10-13 20:59:52 yea some companies put animal products in their juice! vitamin D3 comes from either lanolin (which comes from sheep’s wool) or fish oil. it could definitely have fish oil in it if it’s fortified with omega-3, but i know vitamin D2 comes from plants so it’s vegan!
8127 2018-10-13 20:59:51 Apparent Canadian crude #oil and #gas price discounts are largely about logistics constraints, as @Rory_Johnston pointed out earlier today.
8128 2018-10-13 20:59:45 I find most things I find at the goodwill here don't look good on me unless it's like a work uniform like I used to wear when I worked for a place doing oil changes.  I just make the decision to get funny shirts to distract from my weird body shape haha!
8129 2018-10-13 20:59:45 coconut oil, olive oil are OK too. Tallow...a few others
8130 2018-10-13 20:59:30 But most round here are oil - n that price varies so badly
or electric wi high tariff n old storage heaters
A lot of RSL's put in electric heating that works fine in Scandinavia where houses are insulated but was £70-100 pwk here
Work to be done
8131 2018-10-13 20:59:26 1/ No, it *is* going the way if coal. Prior to reduction in usage was a rising conversation and public awareness regarding human and environmental impact. A search for new energy sources. That is where we are now with oil.
8132 2018-10-13 20:59:22 I’m about to cover some almonds in peanut butter in attempts to get my fats in bc I don’t know how to do it any other way and lord knows I’m not wasting my fat macros on oil.
8133 2018-10-13 20:59:11 I make this bomb ass mask with avocado, coconut oil, olive oil n honey. 10/10.
8134 2018-10-13 20:59:10 oh dear, makes no never mind.  mr chitty coughed up for new ones ... but I really want the old ones .. I will live .. sniff x
8135 2018-10-13 20:58:54 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
8136 2018-10-13 20:58:23 We'll be using the same currency England will use to buy our oil.
8137 2018-10-13 20:58:22 I am guessing that citizens will have to take their money out of the oil and gas investments. We can do this as we decide where to invest our money. I don't think government will do anything at any level. It's all BS chatter and no action. @RachelNotley @jkenney @JustinTrudeau
8138 2018-10-13 20:58:03 No worries!! If she uses the Polyamorous bath oil with it it looks really cool and extra pink :)
8139 2018-10-13 20:57:44 Unless you live in Alaska or Hawaii where  oil is king.   But coal (30%) still rivals natural gas (34%) And they are all fossil fuels.   Nuclear sits at 20%.  We need to do better.
8140 2018-10-13 20:57:28 16 years is a long period of time o-o.
Four full tenures. With oil boom.

8142 2018-10-13 20:57:25 Why are they not putting butter and coconut oil and lard in literally everything he eats?
8143 2018-10-13 20:57:24 Politicians invest in issues that provide profits. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Marijuana. @OilGasCanada Even though returns from big oil will be minor after we pay for the env liabilities the industry provides jobs to keep folks busy. These jobs will vanish soon and so value of oil down
8144 2018-10-13 20:57:14 What my heart feels like after smelling that old frying oil 2 blocks away.
8145 2018-10-13 20:57:12 MY DOG HAS CANCER AND NEEDS RSO AND CBD OIL. PLEASE SEND SERIOUS OFFERS TO DM. NOT LOOKING FOR DONATION I HAVE  CASH. Please help me save my little man. He’s the only real friend I have. #rsoneeded #rso #fuckcancer #ricksimpsonoil #needrso #pleasehelp

8148 2018-10-13 20:56:49 We await to see if there is any economic value for the master who discovered the oil, #GE tribulations notwithstanding.
8149 2018-10-13 20:56:49 Someone please explain to me why men need to oil up women during sex. Like what is the fascination of making her all shiny?
8150 2018-10-13 20:56:43 everyone pally in politics home and abroad. I am not against that. I am after values. I am after vision & mission. Did you hear that Nigeria made about $400B from oil alone within the 16 years of PDP? What did we do with those monies? Spent on development &/citizens? Answer that
8151 2018-10-13 20:56:39 oil and water
8152 2018-10-13 20:56:36 It’s getting cold now ladies, GO GET UR OIL CHANGE AND STOP PROCRASTINATING!!
8153 2018-10-13 20:56:35 CNN refuse to cover the continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. HUMAN RIGHTS.@realDonaldTrump @VP
8154 2018-10-13 20:56:34 We get most of our oil from Canada.
8155 2018-10-13 20:56:27 she has settled brilliantly and so has Ben in his new job.
8156 2018-10-13 20:55:59 Wonder how easy the French lobbies are since most of them play with fucking bread oil on their fingers.
8157 2018-10-13 20:55:50 In the last five years the United States has gone from being an oil importer to meet its energy needs to the worlds largest oil exporter and so they don't need Alberta oil or N.Gas, but as our only export customer we flood the US market and must take the huge discount price.
8158 2018-10-13 20:55:45 Another idea was a red rose cheesecake (I've got rose vodka that works for that, from lovely red climbing rose in the back garden) with rose absolute truffles (I use rose oil in those) in a ring around the outside.
8159 2018-10-13 20:55:31 Other oil processes?
8160 2018-10-13 20:55:27 Yes things are looking very good, 
No way...not your Versace sunnies...guess some posh lady is smiling wearing them this evening.
8161 2018-10-13 20:55:20 It's not hard to explain. SA is major supplier of oil, major consumer of military hardware, and strategic location for US military base. Historically, US LOVES Dictatorships and Monarchies. They are typically predictable, stable, few social freedoms, and very low wages.
8162 2018-10-13 20:55:20 Roasted and curried Butternut Squash

Cubed Butternut Squash, corriander and cumin seed powder, ground cinnamon, chili powder,  avocado oil and salt. 

It's just what you need this fall...warm, sweet with a dash of spice. Do keep me posted if you make it.
8163 2018-10-13 20:55:17 Collecting significant royalties and nationalizing their oil industry didn't exactly cripple Norway
8164 2018-10-13 20:55:14 Because so many car run on cooking oil now they are going to try to use it on jets. Highly unlikely! Hydrogen is more likely the answer to using less crude oil products.
8165 2018-10-13 20:55:11 I remember 
8166 2018-10-13 20:54:59 I didn’t get any, but I bathed in bio oil & body butter twice a day
8167 2018-10-13 20:54:49 Fantastic thanks. Both doing me very proud. Xmas will be here soon @OurKate_Oil will be back
8168 2018-10-13 20:54:30 Not sure what you don't get here. The price differential clearly shows that the US buyer knows they have a captive market, and tons of domestic supply. TMP get AB oil to a world market that want/needs it.  And all those despotic tankers in the St Lawrence.. you Ok with them? Why?
8169 2018-10-13 20:54:22 The money went from us to Venezuela for oil.
8170 2018-10-13 20:54:15 German machine without oil !
8171 2018-10-13 20:54:13 The conversation between Irving Oil and Brison must be hidden from the public, especially as we near 2019 oct.  Will Trudeau encourage who ever he can to make this go away.   Discovery might be to revealing, its not gonna go that far.
8172 2018-10-13 20:54:07 Put their country on ban exports of oil and watch them beg for mercy
8173 2018-10-13 20:53:44 @coachingwcrs Brutus and Olive Oil - A Documentary
8174 2018-10-13 20:53:43 The west got into bed with Saudi after WW2 in a deal for oil. Until we don’t need their oil nothing will change.
8175 2018-10-13 20:53:39 Use a vaporizer/vape pen or oil. Also cbd oils will help
8176 2018-10-13 20:53:37 get some emu oil and put it on 3 times a day for a few days and if you don't notice a difference you should take it out!
8177 2018-10-13 20:53:33 My original statement was how about Rachel’s government focus on policies that get Alberta working again. I’m not disagreeing with you on how tax revenue is generated. My point is: in a low oil price economy this gov has done nothing but harm the industry. It has cost jobs
8178 2018-10-13 20:53:30 Rice,oil & fat avoid kro . Ghr ki roti wo b apni routine diet se half. Or ziyda bhok lage to bune huwe chane use kr lena . My gurantee you will loss your weight very soon

8180 2018-10-13 20:53:13 I’m curious to see if any of my friends ever heard of Pure Full Spectrum Quantumized CBD Oil?
8181 2018-10-13 20:53:03 How's your little man? I can see them both growing up.
My katie is at University in exeter...wont see her til Xmas.
8182 2018-10-13 20:53:00 A vegetable stew.  It’s Veryy delicious just blend up one tomato and cut a small onion and vegetables to it preference (potatoes, corn, carrot, bell pepper or zucchini) and first sauté the onion and vegetables that u choose to have (I use water not oil) then add ur tomato purée+
8183 2018-10-13 20:52:45 By isolating and destroying the Union of Saudi Arabia, they can realize their apocalyptic dream of seizing Islam holy sites, and forming a Caliphate! But unlike Raqqa, a Caliphate with trillions of dollars, oil and sophisticated military weapons!!
8184 2018-10-13 20:52:43 Don’t get me started on the woman who said I should try healing my Mixed Connective Tissue Disease With lavender oil...
8185 2018-10-13 20:52:41 Probably smells like burn coconut  oil and latex.
8186 2018-10-13 20:52:38 Turmeric n honey masks n scrubs help a lot with dark spots, and vit C serums/vit E oil! I get em from exczema a lot
8187 2018-10-13 20:52:35 because there's no one more trustworthy than a rich oil ceo! 
8188 2018-10-13 20:52:35 to produce power for residential and commercial consumption. By doing this, they can sell/export some of their exess fossil fuels  to Europe, Asia, South America, and North America, which would lower the global price of oil.
- They resist Zionist colonialism and expansionism.

8189 2018-10-13 20:52:30 When the West doesn't want their oil & they don't want our weapons. Money trumps morality everytime
8190 2018-10-13 20:52:01 There will be sensible opposition to pipeline expansion. But folks want jobs. The pipeline expansion creates a few short term jobs that will lubricate the approval. The @OilGasCanada make more profits. But @YourAlberta makes more money from gambling than oil. Planet dies for $$
8191 2018-10-13 20:51:53 The bottom line is Notley is not for the oil field companies or oil field towns or cities .. She’s proven that to all of us quite well
8192 2018-10-13 20:51:39 She needs oil too my dear @CravingChloe  let’s get these edges back in full effect
8193 2018-10-13 20:51:19 《オリーブ油豆知識》

8194 2018-10-13 20:51:10 My original tweet stands then.

There’s examples where public capitalism could work. Norway’s handling of the North Sea Oil and giving the entire population shares and therefore dividends vs Thatchers selling the whole lot.
8195 2018-10-13 20:51:05 Peppermint oil I think
8196 2018-10-13 20:51:04 I did my darling.  Thank you.  I had to get a photie with the bull.  nice to arrive to good news from the Hill.  But the FTSE, pah.  Also I lost my Versace sunnies doh x

8200 2018-10-13 20:50:56 Sadly the economists become accountants when commenting on economic matters. Did japan and South Korea, net oil importers go bust when oil prices sky rocketed. No. Countries progress with high productivity rates. More production with same input. And thus not only meet aggregate..
8201 2018-10-13 20:50:43 Since y'all know every goddamn thing, what's y'all favorite essential oil?
8202 2018-10-13 20:50:42 @TheNickHelm if you were an anchovy would you prefer being preserved in light oil on the deli stand at Waitrose or salty ‘n’ tinned?
8203 2018-10-13 20:50:41 Yeah cause all the oil and stuff
8204 2018-10-13 20:50:37 oil paint can suck my dick
8205 2018-10-13 20:50:30 Are you ok? 9 billion RTGS balance  no cash economy and you are back to normal with the price of cooking oil .What is the root cause of all this and the solution yo the root cause is the answer to the Zimbabwean economy
8206 2018-10-13 20:50:28 had a similar experience and used a combo of aloe vera gel and vitamin e oil. it cleared up in like 2-3 days
8207 2018-10-13 20:50:27 Because we are oil based town city she has decided to take it out on us everybody knows this.. So don’t go preaching to me how Notley wants to or your fields up and running baloney
8208 2018-10-13 20:50:23 Breakfast/lunch has consisted of 2 pickles, a half cup of left over fried rice but not fried rice, leaves with a little oil&vin, dragon fruit cubes and La Croix.
8209 2018-10-13 20:49:51 We must:
Take back congress in November;
Take back the country in 2020;
Stop fracking; close coal plants; get off oil; switch to wind and solar energy.
8210 2018-10-13 20:49:51 Oil!!
8211 2018-10-13 20:49:50 yeah sorry i'm gonna have to come confiscate those tomatoes

they'll be uh, disposed of correctly

8212 2018-10-13 20:49:47 Mr do fine Weldon oo  
8213 2018-10-13 20:49:45 Also the @albertaNDP have not been as productive in @YourAlberta as they billed themselves to be in opposition. The fracking business is harmful to water supplies. The water is more imp than the oil. No mention of any action on the env mess of @OilGasCanada Profits big with NDP

8215 2018-10-13 20:49:11 My long-running theory that if one principal factor of WW2 was access to oil, then one factor of WW3 will be access to markets for it is a little too close to being tested

8223 2018-10-13 20:48:29 The US should end the War in Afghanistan, then use the money they save to develop an  Alternative energy Sources like Fuel Cell technology. The US is far to dependent on Saudi Oil.

8227 2018-10-13 20:47:57 Were you consulted before Lagos state was declared an oil producing State and started to receive 13% derivation but Anambra was not?

8229 2018-10-13 20:47:41 Especially when other countries, like Denmark, Norway or Sweden, invest in solar, wind, hydro or geothermal. Why is the government not announcing investments in these renewables, instead of pipelines? If we invest in oil, we're gonna be stuck in oil.

8232 2018-10-13 20:47:05 You don't need to break it to me. Nigeria just like other oil economies is not immune from the realities of low oil prices. If you think economic diversification can happen overnight, I will ask you to go read the new economic programs of Saudi Arabia.
8233 2018-10-13 20:46:53 anyone on here know of any products, remedies or treatments for dry course curl hair?? it’s a 3C curl and i tried using the normal coconut oil, olive oil, mayo. i tried Jamaican Castro oil but i find its too tar-like and seems to just clump and stick in my hair.

8237 2018-10-13 20:46:25 I think Pakistan must overcome it's dependencies to the USD. 
It is time to dump the dollar as a trading currency and start some type of barter trade. Explore oil and increase production and sell the crude to China etc. Start cpec asap,5 trillion worth trade will pass.

8239 2018-10-13 20:46:21 Oshare, oil dey your head. We could move the Naval Base to Oghara and re-install the NPA.
8240 2018-10-13 20:46:08 Found the cutest outfit for my mock interview, got my nails done , & got my oil changed 
8241 2018-10-13 20:46:06 I'm into oil paintings love the texture.
8242 2018-10-13 20:46:00 Sorry I'm doing fine, am not poor
8243 2018-10-13 20:45:57 Oil looked pretty good today. Lots of jump. Plus Connor .
8244 2018-10-13 20:45:43 She's wearing shades, weighs about 102 lbs. and flashed a fake police officers badge while she was whoring for attention. This anorexic Olive Oil has a lot of meth head idiosyncrasies. Does she have any warrants? They protect theres when there wrong especially against us.

8246 2018-10-13 20:45:26 Thought the red pants were covered with oil!
8247 2018-10-13 20:45:18 Wolf has done absolutely nothing for PA, which has serious problems. He's been gov. for 4 years & is campaigning on "changing Harrisburg." He's criticized Wagner for $$ from "big oil" (less than $500K) while he got $6 million from public unions, $3 million from out-of-state, etc.
8248 2018-10-13 20:45:17 Saturday night could be this. Mafalde with Guanciale. Onion. San Marzano tomatoes. White wine. Pecorino and fresh ricotta.   Chicken braised in White wine. Garlic. Rosemary. Olive oil. Spinach.
8249 2018-10-13 20:45:12 Trump IS the Snake Oil and Potion Salesman CON-MAN Who The People BELIEVE When He Comes To Town. It matters NOT that he takes their money (Democracy, Country, Jobs, Everything) , They place their faith in Him!!!  Even though he lets them down, they are Blinded by The BULLSHIT!!!
8250 2018-10-13 20:44:57 Several new properties hitting the market Monday. 4.3 acres with newer bungalow surround by farm land and nature. Oil springs
8251 2018-10-13 20:44:50 If it was we’d finally have that oil money to invest in the squad!
8252 2018-10-13 20:44:30 Oil...
8253 2018-10-13 20:44:29 What are you talking about? Pipelines don’t have emissions.. upstream is the most regulated oil industry in the world, downstream at market, there will be emissions.. irregardless if our oil or someone else’s.. do u like social programs or propping up dictators?
8254 2018-10-13 20:44:29 I've never heard the phrase 'essential oil enema' before.

Jesus Kraaist. 
8255 2018-10-13 20:44:26 Particularly Criminal Downer who spied on East Timor leaders to Vheat the struggling new gov out of their Rightful oil revenues frm Timor Strait! Now this creep argues for Disabling of Children? And we were taught Hitler was Inhuman?
8256 2018-10-13 20:44:17 My mums fav. Got brought up on it
8257 2018-10-13 20:44:15 Had a great Listening Tour today on Energy development in Colorado. Heard fantastic stories from people who have had a second chance at their lives because of oil and gas, as well as a great discussion on overall energy production. #NOon112 #Copolotics #COHD50 #ListenFirst
8258 2018-10-13 20:44:15 So, where I come from, many people drink a cup of coffee and eat some toasted baguette with a bit of salt and olive oil. Some add a piece of fruit or juice to it. It’s simple, but healthy and delicious 
8259 2018-10-13 20:44:13 Unnecessary weapon contracts for $ 100 billion and oil for nothing - yes, it’s SA needs US
8260 2018-10-13 20:44:08 I also now have a spray bottle with lavender, Sandler wood oil and a hint of lemon
8261 2018-10-13 20:44:06 The Gus bus needs an oil change and a new set of rollers
8262 2018-10-13 20:43:57 If I break your heart nah oil spillage
8263 2018-10-13 20:43:52 cuddle in a pile of leaves in your bedroom while using a PSL as massage oil
8264 2018-10-13 20:43:36 I added lavender flowers, orange blossoms, rose petals, some old cinnamon and nutmeg, some old thyme and bay leaves, and sandlewood oil and lavender oil
8265 2018-10-13 20:43:35 Ya you tell him. I want more oil
8266 2018-10-13 20:43:33 Well it takes a lot of energy to do, and that comes from a range of sources including oil. It can be done with wind and hydro of course, but you could save more oil by just putting the clean electricity into the grid and using less oil
8267 2018-10-13 20:43:31 "if we stop selling our oil (11% of total produced in the world) in $ your currency will be in free fall."
That scenario is too complicated for Twitter, and highly unlikely.
8268 2018-10-13 20:43:14 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
8269 2018-10-13 20:43:00 This is sickening. Oil companies ruin everything beautiful in this world.
8270 2018-10-13 20:42:54 Amen. Canada needs to step back and reevaluate every foreign policy. Still no clean drinking water for thousands of first nations.  Infrastructure falling apart,  health care crumbling,  education system a joke,  our oil sits waiting for world markets.  Time for Max!
8271 2018-10-13 20:42:51 And buying oil from them
8272 2018-10-13 20:42:46 From an anonymous account, posting lies. Either bought and paid for by Big Oil or tweeting from a dark room in Moscow. It's possible he's actually that dumb, but I think the first two options are more likely. It's difficult to be that dumb...
8273 2018-10-13 20:42:41 My people let gather here:
Indomie x2 - ₦100
Egg x2 - ₦70
If you like garnishment,
Carrot - ₦50
Pepper and tomato: tell who is selling you need small - ₦30
Groundnut oil - ₦50
Total - ₦300
Cold coke - ₦80
Finally ₦380 and sleep 
NB: you save  ₦100
8274 2018-10-13 20:42:40 Stop deforestation. Stop oil pipelines through prime land and water. Stop Fracking, stop coal mining. We have endless avenues of clean energy. Then you speak of climate change
8275 2018-10-13 20:42:28 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
8276 2018-10-13 20:42:23 Well he can go buy one with the money I paid him for my oil change
8277 2018-10-13 20:42:04 Well it certainly has not been Alberta conservatives demonstrating "living within your means" platform.

Their idea was to let oil pay for everything, lower tax rates to remain popular and hope that the economic boom would never end.
8278 2018-10-13 20:42:03 Need help choosing a bottle color for my artisan body and massage oil line...
8279 2018-10-13 20:42:01 Yes, are you not tired of poverty 
8280 2018-10-13 20:41:57 You lie. 
Crude oil never sold at $130 for 4 years
8281 2018-10-13 20:41:52 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS Abraham Lincoln hid a bunch of knives in his hat! ILLUMINATI! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
8282 2018-10-13 20:41:19 #WorstNakedActivity

Cooking with oil
8283 2018-10-13 20:40:59 Agreed. Clearly not sustainable for success over 82 games but there are many times where McDavid will have to lead the way ... even with *gasp* Leon Draisaitl on his wing for the odd shift.
8284 2018-10-13 20:40:57 So much space and all I paint are oil spills on black waves
8285 2018-10-13 20:40:47 Oil sands producers need price support ... but rent control, minimum wage increases, tuition subsidies, universal health care and ag supply management is dangerous socialism.
8286 2018-10-13 20:40:41 Kevin Stitt may have come into this with the best of intentions but if Harold Hamm hasn’t bought him off yet he will soon. At least Drew will stand up to big oil a little bit.
8287 2018-10-13 20:40:29 Oil is not going anywhere if anything it’s going to be on the upward swing
8288 2018-10-13 20:40:28 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
8289 2018-10-13 20:40:14 Gruesome way to kill someone! Terrible the journalists suffered so much and we do g know the horrors other sufferered or strong women!! DEMONS DOING STUFF LIKE that!! So if TRUMP doesn’t, WE CAN! Stop travel to SAUDI ARABIA, NO TRUMP ANYTHING, NO STATIONS with SAUDI OIL! ETC!

Live traditional oil painting
8294 2018-10-13 20:39:58 Nothing...except oil. To my knowledge, oil has been held over our heads since the Carter Administration. The difference  has been that we've had strong alliances with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries during the Republican admins. Less so during the Dem admins.

8296 2018-10-13 20:39:37 Hahah facts I need some the other stuff tho not just the oil
8297 2018-10-13 20:39:31 Bastard Saudi's. They can keep the oil & money. Most of the 9-11 terrorist were Saudis.
8298 2018-10-13 20:39:22 It's not a matter of opinion; there are no legitimate ethical principles that would allow people to view oil companies as less than evil. Who the hell is "not in a position" to have a conscience?
8299 2018-10-13 20:39:15 @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump I need your help :buy a painted with oil pictures from me. Very expensive
8300 2018-10-13 20:39:09 Doggg im so FUCKIN  MAD I was at Wal-Mart for 2 and a half hours waiting on an oil change and i wasnt even high

8304 2018-10-13 20:38:49 I took it to get my oil changed while me and Sarah went to get breakfast
8305 2018-10-13 20:38:43 Studies have shown that frying potatoes in oil actually increases the amount of antioxidants in the dish. #SoftBestFeed #SBF
8306 2018-10-13 20:38:35 Doesn’t it feel like Big Oil has manipulated the debate. With many politicians in their pockets; i.e. Moe
8307 2018-10-13 20:38:25 An investor famously saw that a lot of Starbucks for opening and I think some part of Russia or something and he flew out there and discover I think it was all the oil drilling that was going on in Russia.
8308 2018-10-13 20:38:24 First you started from a false premise that lots more oil should be produced. 

Secondly, AB oil is far more emissions intensive than Saudi oil. 

Thirdly, the industry (the ones you should be shaming not me) intends to export this oil and import that other oil anyway.
8309 2018-10-13 20:38:19 And that was from his Dad

8311 2018-10-13 20:37:40 because of the imagery or because you like/don't mind your tuna in oil?
8312 2018-10-13 20:37:35 yes brother ....we know its in the oil
8313 2018-10-13 20:37:29 Money and oil. Otherwise our bills would triple. Sad but true.
8314 2018-10-13 20:37:28 You got that wrong. It should be             “To all the Wells I’ve loved before”
8315 2018-10-13 20:37:21 Doug I love ya, but the price drop is due to world oil prices falling about 4% this week
8316 2018-10-13 20:37:20 A climate plan is not a plan unless emissions go down. How are we going to ensure emissions go down from oil & gas so that we can be at “net zero by 2050?” As per @IPCC_CH report which our government signed off on? #cdnpoli
8317 2018-10-13 20:37:12 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
8318 2018-10-13 20:37:11 You can be a good driver on the road but do you change your oil? How about your coolant? Didn’t think so
8319 2018-10-13 20:37:01 Now I have to wash and oil her hair...."After ten thousand years I'm free"
8320 2018-10-13 20:36:48 4 tsp of oil, 500g flour no sugar.
8321 2018-10-13 20:36:43 Oh I heard coconut oil clogs the pores tho. I'll try the eye one anyway. Thanks b 
8322 2018-10-13 20:36:34 We would not have to do anything with Saudi Arabia if we didn't want/need oil from them. We need renewable energy more than ever, with the Climate Change report coming out and the Saudis barbarically killing a journalist.
8323 2018-10-13 20:36:29 Tbh...  Oil hasn't played shit since the World Cup in Brazil...
8324 2018-10-13 20:36:27 How many push ups do you think you could do, fife? Last pic I saw of you it looked like you started drilling for crystal meth on the oil fields.
8325 2018-10-13 20:36:24 We are discussing olive oil here not your cow mata's urine or wine. So just shut up.
8326 2018-10-13 20:36:24 Heritage has a second licence + oil license
8327 2018-10-13 20:36:16 *feckin autocorrect. Should be, it's not your oil.
8328 2018-10-13 20:36:01 Mr Man, you love propaganda. The NNPC contract issue has been explained. You can keep flogging it. Perhaps you should know that the NNPC has been keeping up with its cash calls to  IOC. Tell me why other governments couldn't despite high oil prices.
8329 2018-10-13 20:35:35 Big oil, big tobacco and the Koch brothers funded the Tea Party. Say Hallelujah to your Gods!
8330 2018-10-13 20:35:18 today I was shocked to learn that olive oil is made from.... olives
8331 2018-10-13 20:35:13 That's exactly what I'm saying too? Except, if you have to drive yourself to a protest against oil companies, you aren't a hypocrite, you're just using the means available? And I never said "fuck it"? I'm saying judging people for driving is erroneous
8332 2018-10-13 20:35:07 So don’t be preaching to me that she is for the oil industry she is anything but and we are living proof of that in my community
8333 2018-10-13 20:34:53 We as a country must face reality, we live in dangerous times and we can not abandon Saudi Arabia for one and only one reason “OIL”. We walk from Saudi & Kuwait is next, Iran & the Russians will control the worlds oil supply. Most liberals don’t understand this concept.
8334 2018-10-13 20:34:43 CBD oil and chill?  

I lit a pumpkin spice candle too.
8335 2018-10-13 20:34:39 Not to totally dispute a tweet that called me a treasure but if you crisp up kale in the oven with olive oil and a lot of seasoning it’s not terrible. 

I should stop.
8336 2018-10-13 20:34:37 Some buy sugar and cooking oil to express their love
8337 2018-10-13 20:34:33 Expectations vs campaign promises. Which do you think should come first? The man hasn't fulfilled any of his promises. I hate to break it to you but all we need is another crash in oil prices and we are back where we started
8338 2018-10-13 20:34:29 Thats what theyre driving away in... with a buncha old oil drums roped to the back.
8339 2018-10-13 20:34:25 Before Oil & Money
We’re ruled by traditions that in their basis are dignified & wholesome!
We’re so simple for anyone who wanted to understand us truly!
But those who judge & move on
Don’t care too!
To them we fill a vacancy for hate
8340 2018-10-13 20:34:16 BOL! Well, I got sum olive oil in da fridge hee hee.
8341 2018-10-13 20:34:12 Lailai,you can't deny I did!!! besides don't try indomie and agege bread,if you want to sleep well.try indomie and sauce egg, Don't use too much vegetable oil Sha.
8342 2018-10-13 20:34:03 No, as I just explained “We import US oil in the East and export in the West” the TMX is about exporting oil out of the West, nothing to do with importing in the East, or Nigerian, Saudi or Venezuelan imports.
8343 2018-10-13 20:33:57 Now our taxes are the highest in Alberta and she purposely did that because were oil based another thing she did it she scared away a $2 billion dollar project on project that was in the area and several of several people I know have lost their homes and everything because of it
8344 2018-10-13 20:33:51 Vegetable oil
8345 2018-10-13 20:33:46 Nice. I must try that. Looks like you don't use much, or any, sugar or oil in your dough. Am I right?
8346 2018-10-13 20:33:45 Avenatti is a snake oil salesman, a shuckster who does more harm to our cause than good. He is all about promoting himself and he uses his clients toward that ends.
8347 2018-10-13 20:33:43 If we can have oil platforms drilling in the ocean, why can't we have sewage waste water platforms in the ocean to clean it up? Why are we letting Japan nuke the Pacific Ocean?
8348 2018-10-13 20:33:40 It all comes down to oil, sadly. And money. Mountains of money.

8352 2018-10-13 20:33:14 Garlic and chilli, fried super slowly for 5 mins in a ton of extra virgin olive oil, a Keith Floyd glug of Viognier, a load of clams, some halved cherry tomatoes, spaghetti, then a handful of parsley at the end. Very classic but very good
8353 2018-10-13 20:33:14 The German machine has run out of oil

8355 2018-10-13 20:33:00 In a world where only Russia and the US buy oil? Or in a world where you think everyone but Russia will stop buying Saudi oil if the Empire tells them too? #ColdTakeWarriors
8356 2018-10-13 20:32:58 Oh wow.. obviously you’re what Jason has been saying.. Second the reason why I started getting an interest in politics is because of what Notley has done to my community because we are oil based.. she cut our cities allowed expenditures by millions and gave it away to a hamlet
8357 2018-10-13 20:32:50 Private funding won’t happen. This isn’t 1988. Oil companies will not give employees time off. City have never done anything on budget or even close. Kids in the add will pay for Olympics and so will their grandchildren. You must work for government
8358 2018-10-13 20:32:49 Horrible isn't it,all in the throat for me,using olbas oil that's helping a bit x
8359 2018-10-13 20:32:26 destabilized the entire area while arming the worst people over there.  Why do we keep getting involved?  Oh right...oil
8360 2018-10-13 20:32:14 EXACTLY. 

We are not financially dependent on weapon sales (& that $110 billion number is a lie).

Saudi Arabia NEEDS to sell their oil. We have no need to buy it. We have plenty of oil & other nations to buy from.

Trump & Kushner PERSONAL FINANCIAL STAKES are guiding policy.

8367 2018-10-13 20:31:04 Serious question: If the oil is going to be produced  anyway isn't it better to have it done in Canada where we have strict environmental and human rights regulations? Or would you prefer to continue to import oil from places like Saudi Arabia and Nigeria?

8377 2018-10-13 20:29:18 Now make an oil deal with Venezuela.

8380 2018-10-13 20:28:42 You are missing the point. The masses will not benefit from the production of oil and gas. The masses never do. Rothschild owns the legal tender of most nations. Rothschild owns the money supply of Venezuela and Guyana. Rothschild owns the oil companies.

8382 2018-10-13 20:28:26 Some of that $$ and oil goes back to the Bushes also
8383 2018-10-13 20:28:25 Sure thing... We financed Russia and (to a lesser extent) Brazil with bubble oil...  and China with industry... and India with service/tech jobs.
8384 2018-10-13 20:28:12 Once those DEMONS are out of there, God Himself will have to PRAY OVER IT! With a sea of HOLY OIL!!
8385 2018-10-13 20:28:08 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
8386 2018-10-13 20:28:00 If Trump can deal with N Korea, why can't he deal with Venezuela? They don't  have missels and are on our side of the continent. It would be nice if we could reach out as a friend and work out an oil deal.
8387 2018-10-13 20:27:59 I don’t think so but if you think Haiti, Venezuela etc.. aren’t. Please tell me what they offer? Alaska is one of our 50 states and produce and contribute to the United States and there biggest product is OIL.
8388 2018-10-13 20:27:54 You are still with your childish bragging?!
I have zero appreciation to countries that made most of their money only from oil nothing to the development of the world.
And, sorry, funding is not considered a real contribution.
Without oil you would have played with your goats

8408 2018-10-13 20:25:38 Really meaningless charts besides public service portion up and hangover from construction projects when oil was booming and decline in energy sector due to price drop.  So yes NDP created lots of public service jobs.  Really sustainable (sarcasm).

8421 2018-10-13 20:24:39 The quantities used of sesame oil are very small and for the purpose of flavoring, not as a cooking oil. The oil has a very strong flavor and quantities more than a teaspoon or so ruin and overpower food. Not something to worry about IMO

8440 2018-10-13 20:22:23 Heres the joke of the day right? So because they have OIL they are our best buds? Even though we have the money and power as a nation now to go full electric and a.i. but because of fear mongering solar wind just wont work when we know it will. #GOP scam
8441 2018-10-13 20:22:21 Thanks for all the hard work Gerry. Never made money than buying oil at 18 ahipping it to US selling it back to eastern Canada at 80$. Amd Bill gives us great examples how to not report offshore villas etc. #sunnuways bestest

8443 2018-10-13 20:22:18 Norway oil production is about 2 million bbls/day of oil equivalent, or 2% of global.
8444 2018-10-13 20:22:16 Angola with 28 million in Population Oil production with 1.5million barrels part day 
Nigeria with 180 million is still battling with 1.59 million barrels par day.
we need to increase Oil production to provide the much needed revenue to fulfil government Obligation.
8445 2018-10-13 20:21:56 Have read whole books on tortilla over the years, almost an obsession!
But for me, some caramelised onion just makes it even better.

8448 2018-10-13 20:21:43 If the American electorate were mature enough to tolerate a sudden spike in oil/gasoline prices, we could act morally and sanction Saudi Arabia.  Russia would be pleased with the situation and so would the Democratic Party.
8449 2018-10-13 20:21:39 I'm sorry to tell you this, but you and the oil are the only olive thing that I like and the rest can all become biodiesel
8450 2018-10-13 20:21:36 Obama interfered in our elections threatened MODI with dire consequences.. India does not have any long term goals to make India's future generation great.. just short term savings from cheap oil..

8470 2018-10-13 20:19:56 On the other hand I am sure that politicians do what people want them to do. So it is up to us to demand e.g. carbon tax and closing of oil shale industry in Estonia and peat industry in both Estonia and Finland.

8475 2018-10-13 20:19:38 Actually not what differential means. It is the difference between the AB price and what it sells for on world markets.... about $50 bbl yesterday.and apparently you're cool with Nigerian, Saudi and Venezuelan oil being shipped up the St Lawrence....again, wtf??
8476 2018-10-13 20:19:37 Why was Mr. Brunson in a hostile country? I want to talk about is Kern County ca! Our gas is now 4.05 a gallon! Why? Oil all around us and our prices is to high! It is not taxes, it is gouging! And where are you? Gone fishing or playing the violin as Rome burns!

8484 2018-10-13 20:18:58 That's a great idea.  Although the pretty obvious answer is oil baron.

8486 2018-10-13 20:18:23 I just dont care where it comes from. It all has to go. There is no way eastern Canada wants a pipeline in this direction. Here is a little tip. Refine your GD bitumen in Alberta until it is as pure as Saudi oil if you want anybody to take it. Dont ship bitumen or dilbit.
8487 2018-10-13 20:18:04 Actually that's a fantastic point! Because who in their ring isn't financed by big business.. Motivation of oil, NRA, money deals from other nations and so on.. Who the hell cares. It's totally the message that matters.
8488 2018-10-13 20:17:52 Iran oil, S-400 & Data storage at that same time. 

I am no Trump fan but India has to offer something to US to cool him off. Some new defence deals or waiver.

8497 2018-10-13 20:15:43 Refer to the term ‘global’  the globe uses over 100million barrels per day.  If some of those barrels come from AB which produce oil at lower carbon footprint than other uncontrolled jurisdictions.  Pipelines use the least amount of energy to transport. The average will decrease.
8498 2018-10-13 20:15:42 No offense, well just FYI I love everyone. You can reach me out if you need anything helpful. But, you look older than your age. Maybe because leaner means looking dried? But happy for you if you are happy. Hugs.
8499 2018-10-13 20:15:38 Yep. Doesn't last as long as the oil or paste but it's really worth trying. Indica dominant too.

8507 2018-10-13 20:15:12 @realDonaldTrump USA can get good image only when it keeps the oil price in the world around 70 $ .This it can do by pressurising Saudi and other OPEC countries or it may agree to supply oil at this rate to any country. Oil revenue is being used for anti american nations .
8508 2018-10-13 20:15:09 Chabahar port, Afghanistan, Pakistan-China, Oil reserves of Iran which we planning to buy, also Iran offers free shipping & Insurance on its oil export so it's cost a bit less to buy from them compare to others

8518 2018-10-13 20:13:54 Didn't #Hitler get all of his popularity from his speeches/rallies? 
He knows his policies are poison so he's on a snake oil tour selling bullshit to the desperate.
8519 2018-10-13 20:13:42 It's used a lot in our group  for parents of ADHD kids. 1 pump = 4 drops of oil. Doesn't make u tired during the daytime either.

OIL！
8523 2018-10-13 20:13:31 My skin is so bizarre, like it’s generally matte but my nose produces more oil than Saudi Arabia
8524 2018-10-13 20:13:24 the state of his basement doesn’t bear thinking about. I wonder what proportion of @WingsScotIand’s crowdfunded income goes on baby oil and aloe vera tissues...
8525 2018-10-13 20:13:21 Oil have left na
8526 2018-10-13 20:13:20 Just got my oil changed and didn't get condescended to once. Crazy!
8527 2018-10-13 20:13:16 Were we to end weapons sales to Saudi that would only open sales of equivalent weapons from China to start along with their increased involvement in the Middle East. That would likely cause oil sale issues as Russia and China would have control. No easy answers. Spain unimportant
8528 2018-10-13 20:13:04 Coconut oil 
8529 2018-10-13 20:12:58 No-one can say we haven't been warned over and over again. And yet the response us to offer silent consent to iniatives such as fracking, new quarries for coal and the ceaseless hunt for oil... LEAVE IT IN THE GROUND!!! 
8530 2018-10-13 20:12:50 Not true. We can send oil prices to $200 in hours.
8531 2018-10-13 20:12:49 last assessment i head is India is too spineless to take any stance.. I hope those 9 million barrels of oil make a lot of money for pvt. oil companies..
8532 2018-10-13 20:12:29 Almost all Asian food uses sesame oil 
8533 2018-10-13 20:12:13 You can use it for oil pulling as well
8534 2018-10-13 20:12:02 Misogynist personally? Undoubtedly. In policy? Haven’t seen it. 

Bigot? Haven’t seen it. 

But go ahead and gulp down the snake oil. It’s easier than thinking, npc.
8535 2018-10-13 20:11:54 Oil change, full tank of gas and car wash! #maintenance #takecareofyourstuff 
8536 2018-10-13 20:11:50 @MorningsMaria THERE MUST BE A #POWERFUL #TEAM WORKING TO FIGURE OUT THAT AT #DowJones 26,000 & #OIL #PRICES AROUND $70,WHAT ARE THE OTHER #INFLATION #FACTORS CAN BE #CONTROLLED,SO THE #INT.RATE DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO HIGH ?WE NEED TO GET USED TO WITH 4.0% #GDP & #MANAGE IT.
8537 2018-10-13 20:11:40 the rise of EV's is the death knell for the oil and gas industries and they know it ... we are almost at the tipping point ... goodbye gas stations! Good bye pipelines!
8538 2018-10-13 20:11:39 If Big Oil doesn't think it's a good investment then why should I have to pay for it with my money?
8539 2018-10-13 20:11:34 Why you blaming him for Katya's downfall? Katya did it herself, she's the one married.That Rebecca's no oil painting anyway. Sounds like he's wanted rid for a while. Sounds like a right whiney nag!
8540 2018-10-13 20:11:33 起き上がるのだる~い
8541 2018-10-13 20:11:24 Is this a parody account? That is EXACTLY nepotism. Trump is testing the waters to see if people will react. Hes a goddamn snake oil salesman.
8542 2018-10-13 20:11:22 Oil both your Vertical and Horizontal relationships....don't wait until you need them!!!!
8543 2018-10-13 20:11:18 腹減った
8544 2018-10-13 20:11:17 In Bosnia during the war we ran out of food super fast. An lb of flour was $50 and impossible to find. Flour, oil, salt, sugar and canned food won’t go bad for years, so we are stacking up on those staples. Candles, the plainest kind, batteries, water filters, etc
8545 2018-10-13 20:10:53 Actually we can do this:
Liquidate $+0.5 trillion saudi investments in US economy 
Stop $ +400 million arms deal & buy better arms from Russia
Stop selling Saudi oil in US Dollar (petro dollar)
Only then we’re gonna see who will collapse
8546 2018-10-13 20:10:52 Lolzzz....we have cut down our Oil Imports from Iran by 60% already, so yes US is still the boss...Well only reasom why we not cutting it fully is we have other stragic interest in Iran, which we can't cut off completely.
8547 2018-10-13 20:10:49 I’ve been driving around STL trying to find a cheap oil place and everyone is charging me 35 and up 
8548 2018-10-13 20:10:30 Avocado oil ranks right up there as well.
8549 2018-10-13 20:10:29 Solid palm oil fractions, whether or not refined, but not chemically modified, in packings of > 1 kg or put up otherwise 1,02 €/kg  change 0,03%
8550 2018-10-13 20:10:19 Thanks for saying thia. I saw one person make this ridiculous comparison, but is this actually a more widespread trend?
8551 2018-10-13 20:10:19 it's the oil in the seeds, so the seeds themselves are said to be bad. But do you eat cottonseeds, soybeans, or canola seeds? Corn oil horrible too.

The PUFA is a poison emitted by the plant to protect its seeds.
8552 2018-10-13 20:10:13 So you prefer Saudi oil then!  Very nice, retired educator!
8553 2018-10-13 20:10:04 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
8554 2018-10-13 20:10:01 "Sincerity is the holy oil which makes the wheels of the soul run nimbly, even in the difficult paths of obedience." John Flavel(1627-1691)
8555 2018-10-13 20:09:25 Thank you for sharing this info! I'll keep extending this to the FBI and others I know within Law Enforcement! Squeaky wheel often gets the oil. He needs to be taken into custody. He's warning what he will do. We don't need another Las Vegas situation before law enforcement acts!
8556 2018-10-13 20:09:14 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
8557 2018-10-13 20:09:12 Yeah personally I don’t think the 10% PUFA is something to worry about. I love olive oil in Italian dishes. The seed oils are 60-70% PUFA, much more harmful
8558 2018-10-13 20:09:06 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!
8559 2018-10-13 20:09:01 I hear ya.  But our country will not survive on green infrastructure anytime soon.  It’s not possible.  The technology & systems are not ready.  The rest of the world will rely on coal & oil for decades.  Planes, trains, ships & trucks won’t run on hopes & dreams.
8560 2018-10-13 20:09:00 Lol.....the dude was a respected oil exec.

8564 2018-10-13 20:08:41 Told niggas to have the oil ready
8565 2018-10-13 20:08:41 Yes ofc it's not a seed oil. Coconut oil is the best. No PUFA

8568 2018-10-13 20:08:24 Better to just eat the coconut.  Same with olive oil.  In an optimal healthy diet, a little won't hurt you.  Problem is most don't know how to moderate.

8571 2018-10-13 20:07:50 You know oil production in Alberta is at record high levels right? And it only going to keep increasing under Notley's plan

So care to explain your pithy cartoon?
8572 2018-10-13 20:07:49 I’m getting an oil change and they have the nerve to have PUMPKIN SPICE OIL 
8573 2018-10-13 20:07:47 I will never stop eating olive oil!! B careful

Also you don't have to do 100% of what Ray Peat says
8574 2018-10-13 20:07:39 When Obama gave out stimulus packages, I didn’t get squat, I didn’t qualify. Why? I am a married man with a family and made too much money (which was still barely enough to live paycheck to paycheck). Obama sucked as president. Snake oil salesmen. Con artist.
8575 2018-10-13 20:07:39 I know.  And I have been on Extreme Ortho spraying for the day ... along with peppermint oil 

But this series on @netflix ?   It HAS SPIDERS coming out of people's MOUTHS.   And I'm not liking this at all.
8576 2018-10-13 20:07:31 Nonsense. They buy his properties and have oil. He wouldn’t do anything.
8577 2018-10-13 20:07:28 Lol how about the fact they made it look like an oil slick on the top of his head. The hair texture stops at the sides

8579 2018-10-13 20:07:27 Appreciate the sentiment. And I actually am not part of the union and legislative crowd on the regular basis but that speech defending oil patch jobs and Albertans could easily have been a Lougheed or Kenney speech. Defending Alberta isn’t a partisan thing

8581 2018-10-13 20:07:13 Tell me why I went to check my oil & had two kittens laying on my motor 
8582 2018-10-13 20:07:00 They have large markets in other countries but losing US from their oil market would definitely hit their disposable income. The princes may have to slow their excessive spending. I've seen them bet $500 on arm wrestling matches and shower belly dancers with $100 bills in clubs.

8589 2018-10-13 20:06:47 is it an oil or gas furnace. if its a boiler that means that it heats water and probably needs to be bled. the gurgling sound means that there is some blockage with air. unless you know how to bleed the system and get rid of the sediment i would leave it to the professionals
8590 2018-10-13 20:06:42 So now you try to sell the world that some guy doing all this innovation and building real products is just a glorified snake oil salesman? Hucksters generally don’t work 100 hour weeks engineering best in breed products

8593 2018-10-13 20:06:30 Limit avacados & avocado oil too. High in beta-sitosterol which inhibits Ts conversion to DHT. Too many tomatoes and carrots can have a similar effect due to high lycopene.

8597 2018-10-13 20:05:47 I can tell you where because I am doing it right now. I am using exhaust gases coming out from oil perforation platforms that are otherwise wasted and polluting the environment to generate energy and feed my rigs. I pay zero for the gas obviously.

8605 2018-10-13 20:04:37 That should mean oil change or rotate your tires forsure or your running low on water or antifreeze. Nothing major though
8606 2018-10-13 20:04:29 Russia is selling oil & gas to the Europe which means they have control. Of course they don’t want the Brits to be independent. Angela Merkel is selling Europe out.
8607 2018-10-13 20:04:14 it isn't people's faults that we need to drive to our jobs. it's the oil company's faults for creating that system
8608 2018-10-13 20:04:10 High dollar revenues from high oil price (selling at $100+/barrel)  was responsible. We need to build the infrastructures that can support production (so we stop importing basic stuffs) which provides job for our people and diversify our earnings.

8612 2018-10-13 20:03:50 A little olive oil in skillet. Crisp bottom, flip. Burn cheese a little, flip to plate.
8613 2018-10-13 20:03:48 Is that an oil burner? Get you Mr fancy!
8614 2018-10-13 20:03:32 Embargo their oil. Oh and we just happen to have some for sale..:
8615 2018-10-13 20:03:30 You might want to look up how much oil  America produces.
8616 2018-10-13 20:03:20 At times I think its problem is that is has too MUCH plot and none of it is good
8617 2018-10-13 20:03:13 Someone once sighed, '' seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria sells groundnut oil."

8622 2018-10-13 20:02:40 2/2 financial markets would lower our credit rating which would mean the pound loses value ... imports like oil will become expensive.. cost of goods will rise .. inflation will rise and it will be like the mid 1970s all over again ..

8624 2018-10-13 20:02:21 A win is a win. I understand what you are saying but with some confidence the oil can be a wild card team. They also never win afternoon games so maybe things are on the up and up.

8631 2018-10-13 20:01:43 Yeah, I don't see that happening anytime soon. If US would ban oil and products from countries it doesn't get along with, then why's it importing from Russia and Venezuela to this day?
8632 2018-10-13 20:01:32 Agreed ! As per EIA - USA and BP-UK information that Pak has a huge quantity of Oil & Gas reserves ! Why don’t we do R&D in this area ! to rely on our own resources to avoid #IMFprogrames @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI

- Fluffy socks, extra blanket, extra pillows
- Lavender oil on your pillow so you go to sleep faster and forget you’re freezing

8638 2018-10-13 20:00:46 It helps a little. The Guardian pushes corporate consumer guilt tripping while shielding big oil and downplaying renewable systems. Also, it is possible to raise meat animals with minimal water & energy use; traditional farming practices.
8639 2018-10-13 20:00:28 Charging a Tesla uses electricity. It may not be oil but it still requires a strain on the environment.

8641 2018-10-13 20:00:21 You gotta get over the greasy hump! Once your hair/scalp are used to not being clean so often they don't produce as much oil and you can go longer without washing!
8642 2018-10-13 20:00:15 Not a mama, but I suggest headphones w/classical music playing and a little peppermint or eucalyptus oil on her feet.

We need to stay focused on renewable energy technologies that will eventually hugely decrease our reliance on oil (definitely don't need to increase coal use either)

Change the oil filter, air filter and fuel filter.
Check the PCV valve for proper operation.
Check the spark plugs and spark plug wires.
8648 2018-10-13 19:59:35 Oil companies are not doing as well because the price of oil is still low comparatively speaking. And oil sands oil needs refining. Such refineries cost billions to build; therefore we get a lower price for our oil. Issues that impact Alberta’s economy are quite complexi think...
8649 2018-10-13 19:59:26 No, this problem is Windows client specific.  AV software locks on read a file that needs to be written by a process effectively corrupting data.  One way many avoid it is to not run AV software, which is mostly snake oil anyway.  Same issue breaks VisualStudio and Chrome.
8650 2018-10-13 19:59:11 But... but... how would big oil execs control the world then?
8651 2018-10-13 19:59:03 Linssed oil .. Williamsburg brand
8652 2018-10-13 19:58:59 Noooo, I'm a survivor of a hot oil burn on my right foot. Long story, but it wasn't worth it. I've never cooked chicken fingers since.

8655 2018-10-13 19:58:41 His second revolver has one more shot's worth of silence oil. But the first revolver pops, still muffled from the residual effects of the alchemical mix, but a loud and sudden sound regardless. Both shots hit, aiming again for the neck, making a gaping hole gape wider.

"Tryin'!"
8656 2018-10-13 19:58:39 since when does my whole family use CBD oil
8657 2018-10-13 19:58:34 Why ban palm oil?
8658 2018-10-13 19:58:18 Where’s the cooking oil? 
8659 2018-10-13 19:58:13 Two snake oil salesmen! Deplorable. Please let's get the worst fringe elements out of our government! Evangelical cult is a dangerous scam!
8660 2018-10-13 19:58:13 You are irresponsible and completely clueless if u think this is what Ont wants.  Your a snake oil salesman!
8661 2018-10-13 19:58:07 Budget for cooking oil
8662 2018-10-13 19:58:07 recovery from the war was basically complete by the late 50s. the collapse of oil prices (to which the USSR was vulnerable because of its post-73 dependence on fossil fuel exports), failed reform/anti-alcohol campaign, and deideologization of the party apparat were more important
8663 2018-10-13 19:57:54 I'd like proof of that statement.

Regardless you're pushing the agenda of foreign owned oil companies.
8664 2018-10-13 19:57:49 What you using that coconut oil for? 
8665 2018-10-13 19:57:49 Kontinue ...Do you need more oil 
8666 2018-10-13 19:57:45 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

8670 2018-10-13 19:57:17 I thought Socialists loved it when Socialist countries drilled for oil to fund their worker's paradise. So confused...
8671 2018-10-13 19:57:16 ha is  that  why??  your Sultan was  constantly moaning  about  Iran  deal bec it  dropped  Saudi  oil  prices  to 1970's??  and  why  they  conspired  w/Trump  to  cheat on  Hillary?  & have  Trumpo  reneged  on  Iran  deal?

8673 2018-10-13 19:57:04 These folks may need our help, but oil companies must also be held to account to pay for it. We need more massive class-action lawsuits to bring oil companies to their knees so public policy dictates the terms and scope of their ops—not the other way around. #CDNpoli #USpoli
8674 2018-10-13 19:57:01 Sounds like a good plan.
8675 2018-10-13 19:57:00 Same. Plus it cheaper. Here, I get an oil change, (10k), tire rotation for $70
8676 2018-10-13 19:56:59 because the Oil are better and will have more pts than your Rangers
8677 2018-10-13 19:56:44 Oil cunts

8679 2018-10-13 19:56:29 Why didn't anyone tell me tea tree oil burns? 
8680 2018-10-13 19:56:28 It’s possible to like him while also recognizing that he looks like an anthropomorphic sewer rat soaked in dab oil
8681 2018-10-13 19:56:14 my hair smells like rosemary and coconut oil
8682 2018-10-13 19:56:12 What about 100’s of thousand of jobs and $7.5 million dollars an hour Alberta and Canada are losing for want of a pipeline. Saudí sells its heavy oil for $60 per barrel more than we do and you guys spend your time patting each other on the back. 
You don’t support Canadians.
8683 2018-10-13 19:56:06 i can’t get over the smell of my hair treatment oil.
8684 2018-10-13 19:55:53 Can we get oil in world please:3
8685 2018-10-13 19:55:52 It's game night at ShoWare. The Oil kings are in town for a showdown with the Tbirds. Are you ready?! Wooooooo!

8688 2018-10-13 19:55:27 I just need an oil change & my breaks fixed DASSIT  don’t tell me about anything else
8689 2018-10-13 19:55:27 Tea tree oil looks fine. I'm just testing secondary alcohols to be absolutely sure they don't work. And even if they did, if they are THIS hard to get, it wouldn't matter anyway. This test is more or less "for science!" Distilled tea tree oil still seems to be most viable.
8690 2018-10-13 19:55:25 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
8691 2018-10-13 19:55:13 Hey, don't you think that @maryscanada is a little fraudulent, as their CBD oil is technically ≤ than 1%?  No small, no taste, no effect. I think grapeseed oil from Costco with hemp seed from the same place will have much more than that at a fraction of price.  #Certified #SCAM
8692 2018-10-13 19:55:09 I use one D3 to heat the house. With the solar array it is a little better than break even and no buying dirty oil fuel. Plus difficulty on x11 is pretty consistent vs other algorithms.
8693 2018-10-13 19:55:08 not sure about palm oil tbh but maybe it's OK. Pretty much any animal fat from NATTY animals is good for cooking...lard, tallow, etc. ...ghee is good but you can make your own, it's too expensive to buy imo. Coconut oil is great
8694 2018-10-13 19:55:04 If you keep checking the dipstick multiple times after an oil change, you might have an issue
8695 2018-10-13 19:55:03 Lavender oil blended with a neutral carrier oil is great for healing burns
8696 2018-10-13 19:54:57 Warriors win has given me a smile, thanks lads. Please when u are coming back bring a lot of cooking oil and some drugs.
8697 2018-10-13 19:54:50 Plant oils high carb??? WTF you taking about?? Oils are primarily fats lol! Get rid of the oil and focus on #WFPB #vegan like Jeff & I have both done drop over 200lbs between us and reverse chronic health conditions. 
8698 2018-10-13 19:54:49 Leak his but? Haha engine oil dey there ni?
8699 2018-10-13 19:54:43 Yes it will increase emissions.

If you have more capacity to move oil you will produce more oil to fill that capacity

And you are potentially shipping raw bitumen to places with weaker environmental laws creating more emissions there as well 

Gawd I'm tired of these falsehoods
8700 2018-10-13 19:54:19 Those religious Snake Oil preachers are bat shit crazy
8701 2018-10-13 19:54:13 Look further down. Norway is a population of about 20% more than Toronto. It has oil which it uses very little of,  exports ships and seafood. It's a product of geography more than politics.
8702 2018-10-13 19:54:12 I don’t use beard oil 
8703 2018-10-13 19:54:12 (if you are interested in marinade: soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, pomegranate molasses, sunflower oil, honey, sriracha, ground coriander, paprika, dried chilli, ground ginger, fresh garlic AKA a classic whateverthefuck is in the cupboard mix)
8704 2018-10-13 19:54:10 In a country where a whole deputy minister sends a wrong message to his beloved people. Everything is back to normal and I purchased my cooking oil for $3.20
8705 2018-10-13 19:54:06 The stupid on this thread is indicative of the conservative cult. Ignore the fact she was asked to be appointed by oil executives because she has a different opinion. Kenney and his followers may like an echo chamber, but as we've seen, it doesn't get projects built.
8706 2018-10-13 19:54:03 Thank you, sweet Yashar! It's called "Beauty Soup" not because of the way it looks but because it is good for one's visage: extra carrots, tons of garlic, spinach, celery, tomato--a splash of olive oil on each serving at the end. I could eat it every day.  It's in my book.
8707 2018-10-13 19:53:53 Coconut oil, grass fed butter, avocados are my top choices 
8708 2018-10-13 19:53:50 The GEJ administration owed the Oil majors 6.7billion in cash calls today its paid up and @AsoRock isn’t indebted and a times they have paid up ahead. @MBuhari hasn’t done much we can say that.

8711 2018-10-13 19:53:10 Sure you won't eat, have oil or gas, and if a revolution comes, what part of the country has all the guns?  Oh, and all that dept in New York and California can stay there.
8712 2018-10-13 19:53:10 Wow!
8713 2018-10-13 19:53:03 OMG maybe it’s because I can’t say vegetable oil 
8714 2018-10-13 19:52:59 Love my hair and I’m so proud of you @oluremi_x 
Thanks for the extra oil.
8715 2018-10-13 19:52:58 Sorry which beard oil are you using?
8716 2018-10-13 19:52:40 In the past it was because of oil, but I recently read that only 11% of our oil comes from S.A. Today it could be because Trump and S.A. share an adversary in Iran. Plus Trump's business dealings in S.A.

8719 2018-10-13 19:52:28 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
8720 2018-10-13 19:52:25 These companies have a right to not be affiliated with the selling of conspiratorial snake oil. Who cares if a few reckless, self-gaslit nutjobs are booted from a few platforms? They are still plenty free to build their own website, start a blog or publish on another platform.
8721 2018-10-13 19:52:19 All depends on how much oil the IS butts from them
8722 2018-10-13 19:52:18 #FattyLiver  Just made a dressing with peri-peri, white pepper, paprika, cayenne, lemon juice and olive oil. No salt. It's to replace Nando's Peri-Peri salt, and although it's not as good, it's not bad.
8723 2018-10-13 19:52:17 So you want to therefore leave EU as good leave EU through Holland? 
Oil and gas is attributed to Scotland by GERS. That's not disputable
8724 2018-10-13 19:52:17 Good win oil... One starts the run..
8725 2018-10-13 19:52:01 tariffs on oil?  heh
8726 2018-10-13 19:51:54 So we are stuck buying Saudi and Venezuela oil .. 
8727 2018-10-13 19:51:53 It's a choice between $20 for our oil or $70 because it's all getting to market somewhere.

8732 2018-10-13 19:51:22 India agreed not to buy the oil from Iran when Michael Pompei visited Delhi! Put your hand on your heart and tell me why India needed S400? we have many problems like poverty in both countries. History tells us this will start an arms race all thanks to India.
8733 2018-10-13 19:51:22 i just fell up the stairs and broke a nail after i literally just observed how long they were getting and was gonna rub some jojoba oil on them when i got home. LMAOOO MY LIfE
8734 2018-10-13 19:51:17 Use a topical. If they say that doesn't count as sobriety they can eat a dick. If Rogan is allowed to take a fucking alpha brain you can rub some weed oil on your knees.
8735 2018-10-13 19:51:11 We witnessed the election that produced @TripleA2019, subverting that is one the reasons #Nigeria with 2m barrels per day of #oil is one of the poorest in the world, is d reason #Nigerians are seeking asylum overseas, is the reason people are emboldened to steal @OPECSecretariat

8739 2018-10-13 19:50:26 Have you watched a beauty influencers skin care routine. Heyyyyyyyy.  Glow mask, electronic scrub. Hydrating mist, hyaluronic acid, micellar water, oil, cream, some other names I've never heard of. Sis!!!!!  I can't.
8740 2018-10-13 19:50:22 Cut a zucchini and a tomato into small cubes, sauté them in a bit of oil and add chopped cilantro towards the end. That tastes delicious in an egg white omelette. Trust me 
8741 2018-10-13 19:50:20 Nope. Oil wrestling with Lena Dunham.

8748 2018-10-13 19:49:50 That’s what Jason is saying .. our eggs are in one basket because of Trudeau.. and we sell our product the cheapest on the planet..if you use anything with oil .. like phones heating your home .. driving .. you need oil.. NOW.. everyone knows where things are headed
8749 2018-10-13 19:49:48 China has 1.5 B people.  Until recently they were living in the dark ages.  They needed to expand rapidly.  It will take time to clean up their power infrastructure.  In North America, we have no excuse for using coal or oil to produce power.

8754 2018-10-13 19:48:47 The world is just funny. If the government finds diamonds or oil in your back yard. Its government property. But if they find drugs, yours...
8755 2018-10-13 19:48:37 Or is it all about the price of oil in the end?
8756 2018-10-13 19:48:33 Nope. The oil price has recovered. Venezuela remains a socialist shithole. Like they all are/were. And social democracy is fine, but that’s not what the Labour Marxist admirers have praised - they praised Venezuela.
8757 2018-10-13 19:48:17 To the Oilers fans who expected a Roughriders kind of day for our Oil bite me! :P
8758 2018-10-13 19:48:17 Laughed so hard I almost fell off a 20ft high oil tank when @NoPHinSteven called @FBHWJoe “Babar” on #Segment17. Thanks for almost killing me boys. 

@fbhw
8759 2018-10-13 19:48:17 It sickens me to think we are allied with one of the most repressive, misogynistic regimes in the world because of oil and arms sales.
8760 2018-10-13 19:48:12 I think that Saudis most oil sell to Asian markets?
8761 2018-10-13 19:48:04 If she wants to make a difference, she should shut down Venezuela, Iran, Saudi, and Russia's oil industries and make us the #1 supplier in the world and deliver the benefit to a fair, open democracy that produces at the highest standards instead of the world's worst dictatorships

8766 2018-10-13 19:47:29 4/ Moreover, you use of the word "also" implied agreement with the previous commenter, and THEIR implication that Bush did it all for the oil. (Which another comment said outright)
8767 2018-10-13 19:47:24 You and @WarGen39_45 are too modest. Really. If i do hit the #EuroMillions, I'll commision you lot to do a real size me oil painting on canvas. In #Hessian uniform. Huzzah!
8768 2018-10-13 19:47:16 They can & could have had a massive tech lead but they didn’t do it. don’t see meaningful effort by any of them except for one off models in coming out in future, none investing in batteries manuf or supercharger infra like Tesla has. Oil lobby hostages & smug complacency.
8769 2018-10-13 19:47:16 Hey @realDonaldTrump I get it. We're dependent on oil so you have to kowtow to #SaudiArabia. But could you work some of that #AmericaFirst magic and improve our energy independence?
8770 2018-10-13 19:47:14 If you want people to buy your oil keep slashing the price until you get their attention but if $16 isn't working assume nobody wants dilbit and leave it in the ground. You are producing below cost I'm sure by now.
8771 2018-10-13 19:47:11 They came close to a big comeback yesterday. Hopefully a better start today....and fewer errors!
8772 2018-10-13 19:47:04 Lavender oil remember how many times you have been here before and you always come through. You are ok. I promise. From a 37 year old mum who has had anxiety since I was 9 xx
8773 2018-10-13 19:46:32 It would be however we should be looking at other energy sectors ans not putting all of our eggs in one basket because as we see when oil crashes so do our oil workers. Meaning ...they lose their jobs and a lot of times their mental health. It's very sad.
8774 2018-10-13 19:46:22 @SEC_Enforcement Please investigate linette lopez for potential collusion with shortsellers / oil companies / car companies. She has been writting hit pieces on Tesla for years and is clearly close to chanos.
8775 2018-10-13 19:46:14 All of seo is snake oil, right?
8776 2018-10-13 19:46:13 cooking oil for what. go and buy in the supermarket. give relevant comments.

8778 2018-10-13 19:46:05 "Nearly two-thirds of all industrial carbon dioxide & methane emissions can be traced to the products of a small number of major industrial carbon producers; 83 producers of coal, oil, natural gas, and 7 cement manufacturers." 
We really aren't about to do anything about this huh
8779 2018-10-13 19:46:00 Several times I've bowed to pressure and bought even the oil only to later give it away.
8780 2018-10-13 19:45:59 if i ask you to take a picture for me and you don’t even focus the light and make it dimmer and make sure my face doesn’t look like a vat of oil fuck you
8781 2018-10-13 19:45:58 Mmmh.   my favorite is from @MorimotoAsiaFLA they cook it at your table on a  ishiyaki grilling stone. They're sliced into .5 oz pieces and they use the fat to oil the stone and cook it for like 15 seconds on each side. Its sooo good.
8782 2018-10-13 19:45:49 The plans for the Oil Rig dismantling site at Hunterston will have a catastrophic effect on local marine life. SSSI site at Fairlie sands and a plethora of rigs and other large marine vessels 'parked' awaiting dismantling and scrapping.
8783 2018-10-13 19:45:49 Then lets not single out WWE. We should also stop using saudi crude oil. Which is found in most Texas refineries. Lets place an embargo on Saudi Arabia. I'm 100% behind it all. But plenty of other companies take their blood money. Not just WWE.
8784 2018-10-13 19:45:31 Thats the only option left. Stove is already on, ive already cher’d the pan some oil
8785 2018-10-13 19:45:13 Nop put it in a better way u guys are more divided than water and oil can ever be..time for u to have a unifying factor ..
8786 2018-10-13 19:45:11 U oughtta get a pass on cbd oil..cmon
8787 2018-10-13 19:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8788 2018-10-13 19:44:55 all of los angeles was built on oil fields. from the 1920s.
8789 2018-10-13 19:44:45 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
8790 2018-10-13 19:44:27 Are you proud of his relationship with the oil & gas industry? He has an ethics complaint open against him. Are you concerned about climate change? We have 12 years! This is nothing to be proud of.
8791 2018-10-13 19:44:25 Alberta keeps pushing Canadian ethical oil. Nobody outside AB and SK listens to that BS or cares.
8792 2018-10-13 19:44:15 "The craziest and whitest things in the world cannot be fondled or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8793 2018-10-13 19:44:11 oil wells were decommissioned. stop trying to deflect.

if they move tunneling to under waldorf or hilton it will just be fine!
8794 2018-10-13 19:44:09 ZANU yakatirwadzisa shamwari. we have sadly reached the point of no return. Having to sleep in aque for fuel, cash, no sugar, cooking oil...ere is nothing to b proud of about our motherland as we speak. our future was robbed.
8795 2018-10-13 19:44:08 One oil well for you and you and you

...share the money
8796 2018-10-13 19:43:43 Nothing screams “football!!” quite like an advertisement for oil droplets. Whatever happened to beer ads?
8797 2018-10-13 19:43:39 Win or lose, I think we are looking at a long series
8798 2018-10-13 19:43:38 I don't know anything about it, but the question tingles whatever it is which tingles when an oil change place asks if they should change my air filter.
8799 2018-10-13 19:43:34 The oil industry in Texas is lobbying the US govt to build a sixty mile long wall along the coast of Texas to protect the industry from rising water levels and the potential of flooding from hurricane fuelled sea surges.
8800 2018-10-13 19:43:33 -> The US, UK, France, Ireland, chunks of European banks are all on the oil currency.  To the point of even wanting to destroy any country that threatens to use something else.

Now why do you think China is investing so heavily in solar?
8801 2018-10-13 19:43:27 1000litres of concrete releasing oil from @CreaghConcrete was accidentally spilled into the ditch at the back which leads in to river almond in the last week. @ForthRiversT
8802 2018-10-13 19:43:22 Rail vs pipeline is a ridiculous argument. Trains transport much more than oil... if oil moves to pipelines, the trains don’t stop running. They just transport something else
8803 2018-10-13 19:43:08 It is just oil to us. Only price matters. If I thought about politics I would prefer Venezuela.
8804 2018-10-13 19:43:05 Is there another way to feed your car oil?
8805 2018-10-13 19:42:58 I’m taking shots shots shots of apple cider vinegar and micro dosing oregano oil everyday and Soon I’ll be rich

8807 2018-10-13 19:42:54 So my skin gets super oily around 4am.. I feel like mamaya may mag sneak in para mag collect ng oil sa muka ko. Mahal na ba mantika ngayon? Should I adapt this to business? 
8808 2018-10-13 19:42:52 make man marry first. These guys can leave anywhere they please. Football has been the new oil for 2 decades now
8809 2018-10-13 19:42:51 Yes of course...but you must pick from steak topping or side of crude oil
8810 2018-10-13 19:42:31 Let's go back to Gold:
cyanide, sulfuric acid, and solvents for separating minerals/ore. nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil  used in blasting tunnels. heavy metals such as mercury, uranium, and lead are released. gasoline, diesel fuel, and  fumes from vehicles/equipment.
8811 2018-10-13 19:42:25 You know what’s a sexy meal. Dasheen or sticky Yam, with vegetable oil and saltfish
8812 2018-10-13 19:42:23 the amounts of cannabinoids you get when you take oil in grams is a lot higher than most people can intake, even if smoking the whole day. it's about methods of consumption and amounts you intake
8813 2018-10-13 19:42:18 EIA projects oil demand will grow by 1 million bpd/year until 2040.
8814 2018-10-13 19:42:10 how do I check my oil
8815 2018-10-13 19:42:04 Actually, I like the portrait.  Gives me an 'oil look' feeling somehow. 
Well, it's a small block and good enough for sketching with a light wash.
8816 2018-10-13 19:41:45 I be putting too much oil on eggs and hash browns smh
8817 2018-10-13 19:41:42 Oil!

You also need it.
8818 2018-10-13 19:41:29 I’d like to see the Oil fire chia and hire hunter! Hahaha
8819 2018-10-13 19:41:16 "Ew... it looks like she's leaking... white coloured... oil? What?"
8820 2018-10-13 19:41:16 As of Nov 1st the NHS shall be supplying cannabis oil for patients. 

I suppose you’re also planning to release those prisoners who got locked up for dealing too, right?
8821 2018-10-13 19:41:12 Anybody watches Discovery ID? The station be putting man under some paranoid way. #discoveryID
8822 2018-10-13 19:41:12 Go Dodgers!! 
8823 2018-10-13 19:41:09 For the oil cooler.
8824 2018-10-13 19:41:06 #RunSarahRun!! Alaskans wake up! Who do U think got all that Alaska oil tax money put in Alaskans’ pockets? 10 yrs ago Palin did!! Ur idiots if U don’t make her run! she’s direct, objective, truthful and honest! Tells it the way it is, her Patriot day has come! Duh!
8825 2018-10-13 19:40:54 Starting to feel Scott Frost is a snake oil salesman. 0-6 for the first time in program history. How fucking pathetic #Huskers
8826 2018-10-13 19:40:51 Come visit me at J n S oil baby we got that #oil
8827 2018-10-13 19:40:51 No, an over reliance on oil is why Venezuela is in the shit. Nothing more complex than that. Denmark, Sweden and other countries get by quite happily with social democracy.
8828 2018-10-13 19:40:36 I think I said that, I said he was a good tactician

8833 2018-10-13 19:40:07 And when it finally happens it will be due to efforts on the left. Libs are ruining our climate to blame it on Big Oil, Coal and those other frackers. Just like Israel making the flat earth round and the Cruz family assassination regime. (Cruz is, in fact a triple agent.)
8834 2018-10-13 19:40:07 1/2 Because she doesn’t. Link in tweet 2 is from Tzeporah’s own website. Paragraph 4,5,6 will give you a hint as to why many Albertans &oil sands supporters don’t trust her. I know it shouldn’t really matter but it does, Tezporah lives in Vancouver. Think she promotes oil there?
8835 2018-10-13 19:40:04 Y’all after three months of my light going off I finally got an oil change
8836 2018-10-13 19:39:55 Fact. We could be free of dependence on oil within 20 years: hydrogen economy and safe thorium-based nuclear power plants (molten salt reactors).
8837 2018-10-13 19:39:43 me: I don’t know, maybe I have boundary issues, I like my art to have borders 
Michael’s custom framing expert: .. do you know if this is an oil painting or acrylic?
8838 2018-10-13 19:39:35 Asbestos literally kills people (and the @epa has NOT banned asbestos)
Oil is fuel and keeps us alive (try farming without oil and not heating your home at 30 below?)
8839 2018-10-13 19:39:33 As you've said no African country is your mate, you're currently mating with poverty, retrogression, illiteracy, overpopulation, scam, joblessness etc. Kenya like Rwanda,Ghana, SA, Ethiopia we're moving forward (No Oil). Kenya had troubles more than 9ja could comprehend fyi.
8840 2018-10-13 19:39:19 Full tank & brand new oil change
8841 2018-10-13 19:39:13 Form the association take the mandate from Registrar of Society and file documents with necessary authority get a Board in place and Nominate a Third Party Contract Manager and than go full steam. This will require midnight oil burning with Builders also 1/
8842 2018-10-13 19:38:45 Why did bring oil in to this discussion?

I see that Ur imagination is set on start mode already, well knock  yourself out
8843 2018-10-13 19:38:32 Putting up with literally anything from Saudi’s is as American as apple pie, and goes back to every administration in modern history. They murder gay people, treat women as second class citizens, and now kill journalists, with no fear of repercussions because we need their oil.
8844 2018-10-13 19:38:31 Let us hope the fact the Jets are a big physical side doesn't play a factor in putting Kassian back in the lineup. Has been invisible yet again this season and he hasn't played a physical game in some time so what would be the point #Oilers
8845 2018-10-13 19:38:28 One bought olive oil in the chemist, for putting in ears
8846 2018-10-13 19:38:26 Will your army be invading country's for their alcohol? Oops sorry I ment oil!
8847 2018-10-13 19:38:10 First win!!  Way to go OIL!  Great saves by Talbs!  #LetsGoOilers
8848 2018-10-13 19:38:03 なるほどつまりカドックくんと相性良？？？
8849 2018-10-13 19:37:53 First win for the Oil. Dare I say it, a must win this early in the season. D was standing around a lot - even on 5v5. Scary stat - Connor has scored or assisted on EVERY goal this season.  #Oilers
8850 2018-10-13 19:37:45 It was literally described as vegetable sandwich  It was dripping in oil too 
8851 2018-10-13 19:37:18 I got my Coconut Oil  I’ve promoted myself in the natural hair academy. 
8852 2018-10-13 19:37:14 Oil dey your head.. You sabi
8853 2018-10-13 19:37:07 How can Jamie Oliver campaign against so many foods but never cook a dish without drowning his food in olive oil
8854 2018-10-13 19:36:57 @realDonaldTrump @NSAGov @CIA @GeraldoRivera @SebGorka @SecPompeo there’s lots of things we can do& maintain trade deals to help our economy w/Saudi Arabia 
1)there’s other places to get oil,,  or 2)start producing more of our own oil and aggressively compete with Saudi Arabia
8855 2018-10-13 19:36:43 Islam became a religion in the 7th Century. Their hell raising back then is well documented. I don’t think oil played role. By the way, the United States is the world’s largest producer of oil and gas. You’re right. I don’t want those domestic jobs eliminated.
8856 2018-10-13 19:36:43 The best way to fight climate change on a global scale is to get our clean burning, ethically produced LNG to large population bases like India and China. Another option, while I'm at it, stop shipping oil from Saudi all the way here. 1 or both these ideas better than a tax, yes?
8857 2018-10-13 19:36:42 Because you can blame BP (and rightfully so) but every time you drive, nearly everything you buy puts money into their pockets. So while I agree that individual action isn't enough, blaming oil companies when we use vast amounts of oil to sustain our consumerism isn't useful
8858 2018-10-13 19:36:40 It's funny that the US is buying oil for 35 bucks a barrel, and the maket price is between 75 and 85 bucks a barrel. My patience is done I get tired of explaining things to stupid people.
8859 2018-10-13 19:36:39 This guy really drove his 70k car to an oil field 
8860 2018-10-13 19:36:37 Rex is totally in the tank for big oil. Overpaid for speaking engagements to become a paid fart catcher on the take.

8864 2018-10-13 19:36:15 Lubricant cycle > oil change
8865 2018-10-13 19:36:10 olive oil,honey,lemon can be useful,you have such a beautiful voice
hope you will be okey soon
8866 2018-10-13 19:36:10 Point taken.  I conflated your reply about the Bush connection with others who said it was for the oil and didn't clarify which one I was talking to.  /1
8867 2018-10-13 19:36:06 is coming from the rich or big factories/oil and stuff? all we can do to change that is vote and protest and stuff, I can't really do either because I'm not 18
8868 2018-10-13 19:36:05 The oil and gas industry has invested quirk some time ago in renewable energy. 
And I don't take your comment personally.  :)
8869 2018-10-13 19:36:00 Going and eat oil down just now
8870 2018-10-13 19:35:59 hahaha omg nooo actually i haven’t drank the Castro oil 
8871 2018-10-13 19:35:55 Think there’s a reversion to type. This is how “problems” would have been dealt with 50 years ago. No annoying Apple Watch. Without endless oil wealth this would never happen
8872 2018-10-13 19:35:23 Yesss love oil cleansing. - You've got to try @willitwellness #DailyDew it has some amazing active botanicals.
8873 2018-10-13 19:35:17 westfield topanga mall (please bring the cake mix foundation and wake and bake oil there )
8874 2018-10-13 19:35:12 @KennethLFisher couple of reasoned pieces on Alex steel's Bloomberg commodities slot this week very bullish on commodities, oil and copper despite the macro wobble. Recall ur London ft talk how very difficult timing commode is. Same thoughts now or are you persuaded ? 
8875 2018-10-13 19:35:09 Phelps should have opened that church on top of a sea of crude oil, then people would listen to them
8876 2018-10-13 19:34:48 It's really all about exchanging Oil Fuel for essentially a #Solar powered one! #Oil companies don't want to lose Market share and take a back seat! It's all about Profit for them, They don't care what it does to our Earth or what will happen to People in the Future
8877 2018-10-13 19:34:35 Currently waiting for my car to be done from the oil change, and im hungry af
8878 2018-10-13 19:34:26 Yeah Kyle but have you thought about the oil profits? I mean we’ve got to get our priorities straight here.
8879 2018-10-13 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
8880 2018-10-13 19:34:21 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #CruzCrew #PJNET #TCOT
8881 2018-10-13 19:34:09 Disappointed by the Premier's speech today. She has an obligation to the province and to the workers but her continued backing of Oil and expansion is misplaced and not reflective of the changing nature of the world's markets.    #ableg
8882 2018-10-13 19:34:07 Is it a recipe if there are only 3 ingredients?
1: get squash, cut off top, clean it out, poke all over inside with a fork.
2: put a little olive oil on a baking sheet, put squash on sheet, stick 1-2Tbs butter in the squash.
3:spoon piles of brown sugar in
4: bake 1 hour @ 400
8883 2018-10-13 19:34:03 It’s because they’re cooked in oil and bck in the day the oil was called the gravy doughnuts have jam or custard in them or are ring shaped covered in icing where as a gravy ring Is just dipped in sugar bloody delicious still warm with big mug of tea mmmmmmmm
8884 2018-10-13 19:33:58 OIL JUST POPPED IN MY FUCKIN EYE SJDBEUSB
8885 2018-10-13 19:33:47 Corporations pollute so much why do people have to keep changing? What takes us effort and money turns out to be a drop in the bucket. Corporations can quickly change all of this: step one, get rid of plastic: comes from oil, never degraded.
8886 2018-10-13 19:33:41 Green the world and fight climate change. It works to save the planet and destroy the christo-fascist, oil barons and banking shylocks worldwide. Oh yes and help the Russian people overthrow the biggest vampire of them all and imprison pew-tin too.
8887 2018-10-13 19:33:38 But yet YOU appointed her to the Oilsands advisory group!? This is the perfect example of your time as premier, go against oil, put your trust in someone who is against Alberta, get burned by them, now that your approval rating sucks your now for oil and against those same people
8888 2018-10-13 19:33:35 if there was ever such a thing as a must win in october this was it for the Oil.
8889 2018-10-13 19:33:35 It wasn't pretty but 2pts just the same. Oilers will need to be much better against the Jets on Tuesday.  Time for baseball :) #DodgersvsBrewers
8890 2018-10-13 19:33:34 Your gonna want a lighter oil for colder weather. Try a 75-80w
8891 2018-10-13 19:33:33 Thanks I'll give them a ring. A friend reckons we're looking at over £6k for combi boiler, 1200l oil tank & all installation. Hoping the cheaper oil over lpg will eventually pay that back though.
8892 2018-10-13 19:33:33 While you seem to conflate the economy and oil production, treating them as the same thing...
8893 2018-10-13 19:33:28 I spritz with a water & oil mixture after putting leave in on my hair. I’ve had to learn that even though it may not feel super wet &moisturized, if it has a natural sheen and there is not much breakage then I’m doing fine. Now if you want some SOFT hair, use SM curl smoothie
8894 2018-10-13 19:33:25 You're really gonna insult our oil supplier? Freakin really?!
8895 2018-10-13 19:33:20 We import US oil in the East and export in the West, price differential is less than $15. Light sweet crude oil requires less energy to refine and sells for a better price. WCS discount is the need for transportation given the refinery locations, most of which are in the Gulf.
8896 2018-10-13 19:33:16 There we go, Oil!
8897 2018-10-13 19:33:15 Have you tried bio oil? X
8898 2018-10-13 19:33:06 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
8899 2018-10-13 19:33:03 Darker side is putting it lightly. Saudi Arabia is basically just a more stable ISIS with oil.
8900 2018-10-13 19:32:52 You don’t really make any deals ever.  The art of the deal is more like the art of the steal.  You’re a con man.  A liar.  An oil snake salesman.  You’re really broke.
8901 2018-10-13 19:32:51 You’re so right. The Saudi’s and Russians between them own most of Knightsbridge, Mayfair etc. When they tell our Government to go “take a jump” - we say “how high”. As we become less dependent on oil things will change.
8902 2018-10-13 19:32:49 Where’s cheapest oil change place!!!!!
8903 2018-10-13 19:32:46 Call home and check if there’s cooking oil.
8904 2018-10-13 19:32:44 Akwai wani phase two ne?
8905 2018-10-13 19:32:35 I use a good lavender oil on the back on my neck. (doTERRA brand is my choice) Hope you feel better soon! 
8906 2018-10-13 19:32:23 When i get asked, girls cant believe i ONLY put coconut oil in my hair
8907 2018-10-13 19:32:20 And you are all for taking public lands and handing them over for oil. You're not good for NM. #VoteXochitlTorresSmall
8908 2018-10-13 19:32:16 looool .. ok for a second I thought you are making sense . I bought this with my own money so I own if I decide to throw it I will do when I decide so. Other than it that’s childish talk. It’s all possible because of oil without it nothing is.
8909 2018-10-13 19:32:12 20181014-p509ir.html via @smh

Rubbish!  US will still buy Saudi Oil, turn a blind to Saudi attacks on other nations etc.
8910 2018-10-13 19:32:03 This oil change is cutting into my ‘get a dog’ budget like

I have tits; someone PayPal me I’ll hook you up
8911 2018-10-13 19:31:45 im fucking addicted to olive Oil i constantly crave chugging it LOL
8912 2018-10-13 19:31:32 “Doctors will be able to prescribe cannabis products to patients from 1 November, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid says.

This followed an outcry over Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell being denied access to cannabis oil’ reports the BBC
8913 2018-10-13 19:31:32 Saima an gama phase two
8914 2018-10-13 19:31:22 Cooking oil $2,50

2kg sugar    $ 2 
Ndazopepuka ndisati ndaona rice 

8915 2018-10-13 19:31:00 NYS has the most corrupt gas/oil distributers...and a jive BS Governor who keeps it all intact.
8916 2018-10-13 19:30:45 Wait! .. So with all the billions phone companies are making in Nigeria there’s not one phone factory in the country. 
-62 years after oil was discovered we  still can’t survive without importing petrol. 
-In 2018, bore-hole & roads are still campaign promises. WE NORMAL SO? 
8917 2018-10-13 19:30:44 Lol been there. Two wheel bearings 30k plus oil filter plus air filter
8918 2018-10-13 19:30:30 I’ve no doubt this new wave of Native American voter disenfranchisement has everything to do with tribal protests against the oil pipelines being run through their lands
8919 2018-10-13 19:30:27 You need our money. Soon we will not need your oil and you will be eating sand.
8920 2018-10-13 19:30:25 Like seeing oil demand over 100 mbd. Most of that supply coming from fields that are 50, 60 years old.
8921 2018-10-13 19:30:22 I tried to send you a tbsp mineral oil but i can’t write on the envelope I put it in.
8922 2018-10-13 19:30:18 So this judge isn’t biased then. I mean what’s a sister in the offshore oil & gas industry when you’re dealing with fracking protesters? You wouldn’t put decent people behind bars for over a year because sis’ wanted to teach them (& their friends) a lesson. Perish the thought!
8923 2018-10-13 19:30:15 Massive win for the Warriors, I think the boys were promised cooking oil @yvonnemangunda @ephraimtaguET
8924 2018-10-13 19:30:12 By the way, what is that leftist agenda you're thinking about? How is leaving the oil economy that enabled islamic ideology to develop, and creating domestic jobs a marxist agenda?
8925 2018-10-13 19:30:00 I feel sorry for you. You are comparing oil money to other private business money. Oil is a natural resource and it should belong to people and not to one family. UAE is a monarchy and one family rules it. There are some genuine criticism.
8926 2018-10-13 19:29:57 i can't wait until i can afford cbd oil, i think it would change everything for me. lol but i have way too many other expenses rn
8927 2018-10-13 19:29:54 -Ready for My Vape oil and Belly button Rings to come in
8928 2018-10-13 19:29:42 Are they oil fired?
8929 2018-10-13 19:29:42 I'll cook with olive oil, but I absolutely hate olives themselves.
8930 2018-10-13 19:29:37 This administration just gets weirder all the time. Highly entertaining but I wonder what are the history books going to say about this man? I cannot imagine his oil portrait hanging amongst the other presidents.
8931 2018-10-13 19:29:33 Somebody needs to get a spoon. She's have a seizure. She needs some CBD oil too
8932 2018-10-13 19:29:31 ”Owl” just leave this right here...the Saturday KidzArt crew had a ball with oil pastels and sparkly liquid watercolors this morning.
8933 2018-10-13 19:29:31 Gramatik and black coffee w cbd oil is the move today.
8934 2018-10-13 19:29:14 Anyone that needs a commission of an oil painting dm me I can work w any price it will just determine the size of the canvas
8935 2018-10-13 19:29:10 I have been seeing an increase in subsidy payment due to increase in Oil price,I need someone to explain to me pls...

Is God not angry with us in the country?
8936 2018-10-13 19:29:01 Abuse of mandate, some folks don't have business in governance. Is this the Akwa Ibom Oil Community Development Commission? @aksgovt...let's stop celebrating activities that exposes the pains of the people @udemejo
8937 2018-10-13 19:29:01 Just started applying organic rosehip oil to my face at night and my skin feels amazing
8938 2018-10-13 19:29:00 Not sure what your point here is.... but as of yesterday Alberta oil was selling at a discount of almost $50/bbl. a whole lot more than the $15bn you quote. And can I assume that you and other BC people will step up and subsidize AB to compensate??   No, I didn't think so.
8939 2018-10-13 19:28:42 I’m on that oil later f it
8940 2018-10-13 19:28:21 Woke up from my nap just in time to bring my car to Honda for an oil change.

8943 2018-10-13 19:28:10 Criticism of Corbyn and his reluctance to condemn Russia is warranted. But will the Tory government go as far as to stop arms sales to the Saudis and stop buying oil from them? And can you finally enlighten us as to what values we share with Saudi Arabia, exactly?
8944 2018-10-13 19:28:01 I just need someone to take my car and fill it up, get the oil changed, and get a car wash with the inside cleaned too  on them!
8945 2018-10-13 19:27:59 The oil in your head is still fresh
8946 2018-10-13 19:27:52 thanks for the site, just followed and will look further into it. SSDI & SS both need to have an increase. When I first went on I was told annually I would see a cost of living increase. Hasn't happened in 9 yrs. Cost of living is tied to current oil prices!?! Go figure that one!
8947 2018-10-13 19:27:50 Saudi also wants the Oil price to keep rushing so she won’t do anything to jeopardize that.
8948 2018-10-13 19:27:50 Nine oil blocks had been mapped out in the Western Basin for allocation to companies interested in oil exploration. Out of the nine blocks, six would be allocated between 2018 and 2019 while the remaining three would form the basis for a second bidding round.

8950 2018-10-13 19:27:41 If we want to keep global temperature rise and the other consequences of anthropoid climate change within manageable limits (for humans) we have no option but to move off coal, oil and gas, and not use most known reserves of these.
8951 2018-10-13 19:27:38 60% of every barrel from oil sands is turned into gasoline/diesel to power vehicles - how is that a different use?
8952 2018-10-13 19:27:36 It's not a thread  @naiynah. So I exfoliate twice a week with a salicylic acid scrub and pure honey. I cleanse with kojic acid soap and moisturizer is coconut oil. It is very light, not greasy.
8953 2018-10-13 19:27:27 By most estimates the North lost more men than the south. The point Trump was making was, prior to Grant the north was not eager to engage offensively. Grant changed that. He wasn't concerned with losses, only winning at any cost for better or worse.
8954 2018-10-13 19:27:10 Like castor oil?
8955 2018-10-13 19:27:00 I need an oil change
8956 2018-10-13 19:26:59 I just go and get an oil change, and now the people who did the oil chane BLEW OUT MY CONVERTER PLUG. For fucks sake why did you all keep revving the engine!? Now my car won’t idle.  
Never coming back there since they seem to fuck my car up every fucking time! 
8957 2018-10-13 19:26:44 You said oil IS going the way of coal, it is not. If you are capable of predicting the future please send me next weekend lottery numbers. BTW your graph was a per capita number not coal usage, coal is still by far the number 2 fuel in the world, fossil fuels still almost 90%

8960 2018-10-13 19:26:26 It feel like every time i turn around it’s time for a oil change.
8961 2018-10-13 19:26:10 Back in summer of 2008, three of the world’s five most valuable #companies produced #oil and #gas. Today, Big #Tech dominates. Who’s next?

8963 2018-10-13 19:26:05 @realDonaldTrump soft pedals Saudis because they spend millions in US (especially in his establishments). US has bent over backwards too long for Saudis. Time to cut ties, develop our energy and let them drown in their oil.
8964 2018-10-13 19:26:04 Really getting into a lot of these large oil on canvas paintings I’ve been seeing lately. Someone take me to an art gallery (and buy me art) pls? 
8965 2018-10-13 19:26:04 All I can see is a slightly newer version of Jin from Rookie King dousing his dish in sesame oil.... that wouldn't fly in hell's kitchen
8966 2018-10-13 19:25:59 Just coconut oil.. The same one we get at dischem or clicks
8967 2018-10-13 19:25:56 Germans have yet to find grease to oil their rusty machine. Not working. The wheels must have come off.

They are missing Ozil's services!
8968 2018-10-13 19:25:48 Getting a oil change after going over 3000 miles is an amazing feeling 
8969 2018-10-13 19:25:43 The place is fine what do you expect ??
8970 2018-10-13 19:25:21 @ReporterPhoenix..the day we stop depending on foreign oil,we will stop kissing ass..solar,wind,water right in front of our faces
8971 2018-10-13 19:25:10 It makes me want to puke.A snake oil salesman for a Washington Post reporter.
8972 2018-10-13 19:24:58 If only we could clean up all that oil and gas we export
8973 2018-10-13 19:24:51 right. it would be better for multiple zukes. though one could stuff this huge thing. i think half can go into breads, maybe a third into a succotash. the rest just fried up with olive oil and garlic. maybe tomatoes and lamb.
8974 2018-10-13 19:24:48 Know why the USA didn't bomb Saudi Arabia after 9/11? If George Bush was prez in 1930+Nazi Germany was discovered to have the largest reserves of oil on Earth, we'd all be sprechen-ing Deutsch
8975 2018-10-13 19:24:39 cant leak oil if its an EV
8976 2018-10-13 19:24:24 If you really want to help children, march against fracking, plastic pollution, and big oil. March for clean energy and fair housing. March for UBI.
8977 2018-10-13 19:24:13 Why would he do so to the one of US long stand ally in the meddle east and the biggest oil supplier if not in  in the world. If he do so unemployment occurs and 1973 crises would repeat itself. #justsaying
8978 2018-10-13 19:23:43 Though true, this puts the onus, "It's your fault," on everyone except the major causes of climate change - the coal and oil corporations. The big bad guys love articles such as this.
8979 2018-10-13 19:23:41 Finally getting an oil change
8980 2018-10-13 19:23:33 They are wealthy because of the USA buying their oil. Well I say we cut off the money flow NOW!!!
8981 2018-10-13 19:23:28 I hit that or Studio City in Sunday. Burbank has an olive oil seller, good juice, great produce, eggs and French pastry/breads. Smaller than SC, but I don't need to amuse any kids so I don't miss the bounce house & petting zoo.
8982 2018-10-13 19:23:16 Is cannabis oil really a cure tho?
8983 2018-10-13 19:23:13 Please come and take our President @MBuhari  and our oil and give us @realDonaldTrump loan for six month. It appears Democrat don't know the value of the 45
8984 2018-10-13 19:23:02 So I’m going to get my oil changed at jiffy lube and my ex girlfriend works there. I literally just vomited in my mouth Looks like I won’t be getting it changed here
8985 2018-10-13 19:22:56 Brennan you just want war with Saudi Arabia so that we can suffer and oil embargo and wreck the economy. We won’t go to war with Saudi Arabia just because they murdered one of their own citizens. That’s their biz. Not ours.
8986 2018-10-13 19:22:48 Also if Saudi cut off oil supplies to the USA who cares , US has alot of oil fields , fact I'll wait 
8987 2018-10-13 19:22:43 The IEA projects oil demand to continue its growth till at least 2050. Any gains we make are more than offset by more and more Asians raising their standards of living.
8988 2018-10-13 19:22:30 That is insanely beautiful, it’s like an oil painting! LVE IT!
8989 2018-10-13 19:22:09 Weren’t 14 of the 9/11 terrorist from Saudi Arabia? Is ther not a lawsuit pending against Saudi’s Arabia by the families of the 9/11 victims?? And we deal with them because..? Flock their flocking oil! I say we put a program in place to convert all vehicles to electric in 10 yrs
8990 2018-10-13 19:22:05 The great thing about internet is when I went to get my oil changed, they quoted me a price but wanted to charge almost $30 more bc ‘they misspoke’ so I looked up a different company, called them, and now I’m getting my oil changed there for the price I was initially told.
8991 2018-10-13 19:22:01 First oil change today.
8992 2018-10-13 19:22:00 Rangers coach looks about as TV New York City as you can get complete with having used engine oil as hair gel.
8993 2018-10-13 19:21:47 Matter of national security. As I've said numerous times America must rev up its electric car production to keep oil dictator states in check Russia,Saudi Arabia and Iran @CNN @timryan @foxnews @msnbc @bbcnews @nytimes @moveon @TheYoungTurks @TheDemocrats @wsj
8994 2018-10-13 19:21:31 Not true, Venezuela is a failed petroleum state who didn't have a backup plan when oil prices failed and everything was tied together and you have the conditions you have now.  Bernie is not thinking Venezuela he's advocating policies that the Nordic states have and are popular.
8995 2018-10-13 19:21:31 Are you coming to get your oil?
8996 2018-10-13 19:21:23 As the body's been disposed of proof will be circumstantial. Many countries will have been shown sufficient proof of saudi guilt. The only issue is will govts put economic self interest and expediency first. History suggests they will ignore saudi abuses again for oil and trade.
8997 2018-10-13 19:21:22 @primetimecrime I hope like hell you have a PLAN to reverse pipe blocks immediately, STOP the belowCost oil selling & FIX ALBERTA
8998 2018-10-13 19:21:14 How difficult would it be to reduce saudi oil production?  Could other nations pick up the slack?  Arguably, they might be able to buy some weapons systems from other countries, maybe they do already.
8999 2018-10-13 19:21:12 Saudi will seek new allies in Russia (Europe Biggest Exporter) but Saudi will suffer...she needs US more than US needs her,Security and Stability and it’s search for new innovations to become not just an Oil depent economy
9000 2018-10-13 19:21:12 Killing two birds w one stone right now getting an oil change while I shop #adulting
9001 2018-10-13 19:20:48 Get Green energy investment going and rid ourselves of oil and the hegemony of its purveyors. Two good jobs in one. It'll take time but , the Government must raise investment in it.
9002 2018-10-13 19:20:47 @realDonaldTrump want to become energy self sufficient? Now is a great time to start...no Saudi oil.
9003 2018-10-13 19:20:44 Mr Jaitly when oil was@ $ 140. the price of petrol was Rs 62/- in Mumbai dont fool the public.
9004 2018-10-13 19:20:43 Facts you need to know about Beto O'Rourke: Funded by Soros, is for gun control, open borders, higher taxes. raising taxes on oil by $10 per barrel, wants single-payer health care, supports legalization of cannabis. #VetoBeto #BetoIsWRONGforTEXAS #NoToBeto #VoteCruz #ChooseCruz
9005 2018-10-13 19:20:40 Oil, yes, but they are never going to NOT sell us oil no matter what happens.  Saudi is still selling oil to Canada.
9006 2018-10-13 19:20:39 I only use gun oil too. I’ve tried other silicone ones but just not the same
9007 2018-10-13 19:20:27 Isn’t it more likely the gain to be had is by auto and oil companies NOT to change...to spread info that climate change is a hoax
9008 2018-10-13 19:20:23 I've tried to understand your narrative but he said nothing about him sleeping with a GAY man. He spoke on him sleeping with a WHITE man. Stop making stuff up. You need some CBD oil?
9009 2018-10-13 19:20:14 I so relate on so many levels but i still keep on trying  :')
 i'd say so far bio oil made them teeny tiny better, it did make a huge difference to scars though
9010 2018-10-13 19:20:13 Sadly, Canada's official bloviator in chief is an off paid shill of the oil industry. Nothing to see here.
9011 2018-10-13 19:20:09 Instead of 3/4 million germans its also likely more troops as well cause this gives germany more manpower and some oil from britian
9012 2018-10-13 19:19:58 Bought my first (fake) Christmas tree to put in my living room since years. Anyone know of some good cannabis-themed decorations I can hang in it?  #cannabis #christmas Maybe I should try making that cannabis-infused anointing oil Jesus used.
9013 2018-10-13 19:19:57 The speed @APCNigeria & @MBuhari  is digging @atiku past, they will soon discover Oil, coal or even other minerals...
People running when no one is chasing them already.
9014 2018-10-13 19:19:42 Come get your oil changed at my work!!! Downtown Kalamazoo!
9015 2018-10-13 19:19:38 and it just so happens they have a spare Ambassador since our got kicked out of Saudi Arabia  (didn’t stop us from buying oil from them though, or selling them military weapons and equipment though ) 
9016 2018-10-13 19:19:32 Good paper, but no evidence of CO2 effect on temperatures. No separation of high water vapour and urban heat island effect. Too many variables. Look at northern Alberta and Saskatchewan downwind of the oil sands industry. High CO2. No other variables. Temperature anomalies=zero
9017 2018-10-13 19:19:30 Cable lubricating oil burritos made therefrom
9018 2018-10-13 19:19:26 Don't worry Paperchase, we got oil down to 18$ Koch brothers want no part of that. Justin does so much for Canada. Some suckers  still think we will build a pipeline
9019 2018-10-13 19:19:25 Do Auburn boosters have crazy oil money or nah?
9020 2018-10-13 19:19:24 I would raise my car but fuck it as long as I’m not hitting my oil pan or trans idgaf
9021 2018-10-13 19:19:10 Not so: oil!  You need customers and the US has been a steady customer for many decdes.
9022 2018-10-13 19:19:08 The oil for his brain box don dry
9023 2018-10-13 19:19:06 The oil and car companies aren’t going to want to do that. They should, of course, but in addition voting for reduction of cars is a good thing. I also get where you’re coming from and it’s not fair to not upzone and also charge fees.
9024 2018-10-13 19:19:01 
9025 2018-10-13 19:18:59 Its unfortunate people are subjected to unfriendly circumstances as a result of the fare hikes, but any rational being would also look on the other side, 5L engine oil pegged @ $112 and other motor spares costing 5 times more than b4. Operators are trying to stay afloat.

9029 2018-10-13 19:18:49 The bestherapy for optimal health and longevity is to regularly service our body with the green leaf extract of edible plants like mango,guava,cashew,pear,bitter leaf and pumpkin leaves.They are the oil treatment for our body fluids including the blood plasma.
9030 2018-10-13 19:18:46 China looks south and west for oil. Russia is an export partner, not a consumer of SA product.  Both are strong new allies, but in a pure market sense, they wont be able to replace the US.  

I'm not arguing that our trade is beneficial beyond economics, I'm simply stating facts.
9031 2018-10-13 19:18:34 It's not cheese though, it's solidified oil.
9032 2018-10-13 19:18:32 I don’t like it, but he is not in a position to lose seats in corn country.  This is actually Trump being smart politically.
9033 2018-10-13 19:18:30 It's curious that these cherry picked quotes were all made by Liberal Party supporters.

This article found time to mention 1972 Martial Law yet didn't touch on current oil prices or typhoons that ravaged PH food production.

You know...things that actually affect inflation. 
9034 2018-10-13 19:18:23 Ya but the military does so many horrible things to pollute the planet, like Dump tons of oil into the ocean and not even think twice. Unless a huge population goes vegan a couple people doing it won’t change things. Companies will continue to kill/ pollute.
9035 2018-10-13 19:18:07 I love how everyone is missing the whole damn pony of the war "oil" the germans had thousands of tanks but only used like barely half of them cause of oil shortages if the battle of britian was won for the germans its very most likely germany would win

9044 2018-10-13 19:16:58 Hi @RippleFoods. I also noticed a smell and taste difference at the same time as the new bottles were released: a strong seaweed flavor. Has there been a change in the formula? Or perhaps this batch of algal oil is more pungent? I find it very off-putting. Thanks
9045 2018-10-13 19:16:57 Take it back and get an oiled one. You’ll thank me. Oil free is LOUD
9046 2018-10-13 19:16:55 Did you guys not see Lawrence of Arabia... now on steroids with oil wealth and region. What not to like?
9047 2018-10-13 19:16:49 Ok. Can Americans now STOP going to these Shiite Hole countries that kidnap Americans and hold them hostage? Save us all a lot of trouble.
9048 2018-10-13 19:16:47 Well I lost the other $21 for my oil change, lmao here with just my cash, my ID, and my Walmart credit card.

Guess I’m walking down the street and getting a cash advance. Fuck me dude.
9049 2018-10-13 19:16:40 The walls of my tub are coated in oil
9050 2018-10-13 19:16:37 I could deal with Pauly Shore and Bobcat Goldwaithe calling games if the Oil were winning regularly. It’s management that tortures us. But I agree, bad.
9051 2018-10-13 19:16:23 So I always, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, do my own maintenance and such to my own car but every blue moon I get lazy and take it to go get an oil change. Haha! Once a year laziness.

9053 2018-10-13 19:16:21 How are you pregnant again when you had to set up a go fund me account for a fucking oil@change to move back in with your parents? I swear ppl stop having babies just cause you think they’re cute and stop puttin on a front for social media cause your shitty parents
9054 2018-10-13 19:16:17 About to make my own beard oil
9055 2018-10-13 19:16:11 I went to get an oil change, said everything was ok then 45 minutes later it broke down
9056 2018-10-13 19:15:43 You sick again my dear? Some strange viruses going on out there. if you are on antibiotics you must have an infection. That's an interesting dish with the rice and tart apples. Take good care of yourself, bone up on that Oil of Oregano. 
9057 2018-10-13 19:15:13 Let me explain the context for my joke. Let's begin by taking both at their word. Berman wants to shut down all expansion of the oil sands and transportation of liquid fuels to to other markets by pipeline. It is "all" environement. And no economic sense at all. 1/2
9058 2018-10-13 19:15:08 Baby oil for cooking?
9059 2018-10-13 19:15:01 It’s all about the oil stupid... the US sanctions on banks and oil in Iran will take effect on Nov’ 4. the Saudi Arabia is a key factor to prevent a shortage of energy markets and price frenzy... anyone who fantasizes about "hard punishment" should practice more of Tantra...
9060 2018-10-13 19:14:50 parece ser que le dieron una capa de nul oil. Le faltan luces... y a mí también 
9061 2018-10-13 19:14:32 As the smell of burning oil and the blue haze that goes along with it fills the air.

9065 2018-10-13 19:14:13 I guess that they can't sell oil to Russia.
9066 2018-10-13 19:13:51 that wrestling match didnae include oil?  polis wid have been cauld in if it hid been
9067 2018-10-13 19:13:45 Hey does anyone know why food that's been pan fried in a bit of olive oil is so delicious
9068 2018-10-13 19:13:40 The Saudis want high oil/gas prices. The Russians do too. 45 cares more about them than you.
9069 2018-10-13 19:13:32 Coconut oil is the best. Google "Ray Peat coconut oil" for all the benefits, I've poasted on it before
9070 2018-10-13 19:13:30 So, I got my hands on a THC oil cartridge and tried it.. 
Fuck, y’all can keep that shit.. 
I got high af off one hit, but it tasted like I vaporized kerosene
Concentrates are good but I’m sticking to smoking it like god intended. No wonder you got people thinking they dying 
9071 2018-10-13 19:13:29 Did you see that last play? The fact the it didn’t end up in the back of the net might mean the season has turned around
9072 2018-10-13 19:13:03 How is selling the dirties oil on the planet being a climate leader?? To make such an assertion just because we don't behead journalist is immoral and unethical. Solar, wind, hemp, and increased development on batteries and storage, would ACTUALLY make you a climate leader.

9083 2018-10-13 19:12:15 Delete your tweet read some books hitler invaded russia because of the oil fields in the south without oil the germans couldn't stand in a war
9084 2018-10-13 19:12:07 Oil does NOT moisturize. It seals in the moisture, which also means it can block any additional moisture you want to add after applying it. That’s why y’all suffer from being dry all the time because you’re preventing moisture from getting in by thinking oil alone is moisturizing
9085 2018-10-13 19:12:02 Eso va a ser por el nul oil... seguro!
9086 2018-10-13 19:11:40 yeah no one cares bout the biggest oil and fish export in the whole world
9087 2018-10-13 19:11:32 Oil and filter changed, back to stock wheels 
9088 2018-10-13 19:11:31 I'm confuse about Bishop Kuka's visit 2 OBJ with Atiku. Does that mean he aligned himself with d powerful presidents he claimed were giving out oil blocks 2 their girl friends? I know PMB doesnt have oil block talk less of giving his girlfriend @segilolaa @ijaola_ibrahim @Mr_JAGs
9089 2018-10-13 19:11:28 Put my first order in for CBD oil useing " Fowler code ..

9092 2018-10-13 19:11:06 guys,, im thinking of pricing my art prints at 10 sgd. is that reasonable/decent considering that the original medium was oil paint on canvas panel?
9093 2018-10-13 19:10:53 I think they always have  been Muslim base.. what do you mean when you say contrary to their history? Saudi's think they are the chosen people but it's the 'oil' speaking more than anything. Turkey on other hand have a history of expanding Islam.
9094 2018-10-13 19:10:49 Lol as a historian this is 100% correct the whole invasion of the ussr was because germany needed oil because britian blocked their resources coming in with the biggest navy in the world if britian surrendered they would have oil and made a successful invasion of russia
9095 2018-10-13 19:10:47 Big & Good climate news happened in September:
1. Chinese EV sales increased 55% as auto sales fell 12%;
2. Tesla Model 3 was a top 5 selling car in US (remarkable given its 50K price);
Transportation (oil) is major emissions source but 9/2018 had 2 big EV milestones.
9096 2018-10-13 19:10:26 He hung a wire leader with tarnished tinfoil seen through the end where oil had spread a double rainbow, rainbow! And I stared
9097 2018-10-13 19:10:24 It works like magic honestly I do it all the time but don’t let it get into your eye and you could use a toner or even rosewater after to reduce the extra oil left back

9103 2018-10-13 19:09:29 If we now a net exporter then why are these corn ethanol people talking about us having to import 10 million barrels of crude a day?  And then claiming we need to jack up the RFS because otherwise we'll be dependent on foreign oil. Something smells wrong.
9104 2018-10-13 19:09:21 Just being facetious Rob! Its the only way I can watch the oilers anymore
9105 2018-10-13 19:09:21 Somehow that seems as it should be. Possibly with overtones of wood smoke and engine oil 
9106 2018-10-13 19:09:13 I know the Texan accents, I worked in Oil and gas companies in Aberdeen and was working with Texans

There's decline in cocoa farmer pop

Let's be careful
There's danger ahead
9108 2018-10-13 19:08:58 need to take a bath. oil myself up then find something to watch on my laptop.
9109 2018-10-13 19:08:55 I remember when Skeptics were just beardy dudes who went up to Mediums and snake oil salesmen and screamed "BULLS***" at them. 

I'd add "Objective" to this list as well.
9110 2018-10-13 19:08:46 Oil and water cannot unit, problem of Nigeria is not Igbo president, it is true federalism and regional autonomy, even if Jesus become the president in Nigeria the system and foundation will not allow him to do wonders,
9111 2018-10-13 19:08:43 He releases the puck like a 10-goal/ 25-pt guy. This is who he is.
9112 2018-10-13 19:08:41 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
9113 2018-10-13 19:08:29 Stop your whining we still bomb innocent people everyday. Bring the boys home and get out of the middle east is what you should do something about. According to Trump we don't need their oil. And we don't need to be involved in their 1000 yr old civil wars. Like Nam no win
9114 2018-10-13 19:08:23 It's literally why we have fossil fuels in the first place.  Ancient plants that stored solar energy and then that was converted into potential chemical energy which we now use today.

If the fucking 1st law was applied the way you are talking we would never have had oil.
9115 2018-10-13 19:08:14 Jim, Trump hates Socialist, not Socialism because it doesn't work and Socialist want to steal from the rich and give to the lazy. Capitalism works and doesn't need Bailed out. He's trying to get us independent from the Saudi oil empire, but you resist everything he does. MAGA
9116 2018-10-13 19:07:51 違和感なさすぎてーーー！！！！
9117 2018-10-13 19:07:40  Sesame oil is exactly what’s up for me tonight.
9118 2018-10-13 19:07:38 EVERYBODY has been ignoring the Saudis behavior due to OIL. Stop talking this political crap with Obama, Clinton. But Trump and Kushner have become even friendlier with the Saudis.
9119 2018-10-13 19:07:35 Frying meat and not trying to get popped by the oil is an extreme sport
9120 2018-10-13 19:07:29 Military controls what technology is available to public. 4 biggest banks in world also own the 4 largest oil companies. Let AI advance too fast and they're all out of business. The public is easily at least 20+ years behind in technology from what the gov/military really has.
9121 2018-10-13 19:07:18 I never can decide which bath bomb, bath oil, & bubble bars to order. @lush needs a subscription box type of service.
9122 2018-10-13 19:07:17 RT @essjrs: Three hours and counting on the broken down wrecks that the MBTA calls trains. Have any of our riders been to Europe and seen what an economy and politicians not bought off by big oil can have?  It is NOT better in the USA. #MBTAfail
9123 2018-10-13 19:07:10 It is not some kind of a binary choice. That is absurd. You can have the TMP and Vancouver will continue to be beautiful. In fact, oil by rail posed a far greater threat, all along its route, than does any pipeline.
9124 2018-10-13 19:07:03 Le médiocre je vous le retourne, on peut pas les jours pairs utilisé l’argument c’est le climat qui change pas la météo et les jours impairs tomber dans le panneau...
Il y a assez de bons arguments pour pas prendre celui qui est faux!
9125 2018-10-13 19:07:01 1. Oh! Like America held them accountable for 9/11 ( under the last republican president I might add). They will probably investigate this until the end of time. How can you put sanctions on s country that got oil money? 
9126 2018-10-13 19:07:00 Shrimp tacos w/ oil&vinegar slaw for dinner!!  I can't wait!
9127 2018-10-13 19:06:52 I have had good broccoli with sesame oil and sesame seeds, even with tofu. But brisket tho...
9128 2018-10-13 19:06:51 Sadly, I’m not longer working at the daycare. I got a job at Herold Zeigler and I am a cashier. If you need an oil change, you can come and visit me
9129 2018-10-13 19:06:45 not to mention the fact that white people would probably own coal and oil mining reserves but they don’t want to ruin their own environment and so outsource to other countries because they don’t care about the health of poc n that’s y poc own them ! 
9130 2018-10-13 19:06:38 Peppermint oil will make your hair flourish if you do mini masks and add it
9131 2018-10-13 19:06:30 Oh you should, I love quorn. I like the chicken pieces best and I cook them with a little oil and wait until they’re a little fried/crunchy before adding sauces etc.

9133 2018-10-13 19:06:24 Congress has denied funding of any kind for gun violence research. This forces independent studies similar to studies conducted by the tobacco and oil companies refuting the true harm their products cause. Opposition groups will refute university studies as liberal bias.

9137 2018-10-13 19:06:09 Who do you think is driving this?! Zinke was handpicked by Trump. #Trump wants our protected #wildhorses out of the way for His Billionaire ranchers & oil men so they can take over Our public lands for Their own selfish $$$  reasons.
9138 2018-10-13 19:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
9139 2018-10-13 19:06:01 It has that hempy, earthy taste as you'd expect with CBD oil but this brand has a much milder taste than some of the others I've tried, this was the first thing I noticed when I tried it. Ideal for people who don't really like the taste of oils!
9140 2018-10-13 19:05:57 @Oil4Wales Hi, do you install oil boilers along with oil tanks? We currently have LPG bottles/boiler but thinking of switching. Thanks,
9141 2018-10-13 19:05:46 Oil.
9142 2018-10-13 19:05:44 Within a view year, the US will produce enough oil for its own needs and is does not need any foreign oil. The future is not bright for the Saudi's.
9143 2018-10-13 19:05:42 Sadly I’m tweeting to a professor, mutual interests guides all countries relationships with each other, if we stop selling our oil (11% of total produced in the world) in $ your currency will be in free fall. Currencies are commodities. If their is demand its value goes up.
9144 2018-10-13 19:05:31 Not so sure since Romania & Hungary were integral to Germany's oil supply, which was in dangerously short supply for the war effort. If they couldn't safeguard that supply from the Allies, they essentially had to surrender.
9145 2018-10-13 19:05:24 I made a simple dish with asparagus, (glazed) onions, garlic, pine nuts, fresh basilicum, spaghetti, olive oil, hot pepper, salt and some Parmesan !  My family loved it. I suppose, dear Steve, you don’t have cheese. That’s yet one bridge too far for us now .
9146 2018-10-13 19:05:23 And guess what? We are closer and closer to never needing oil again.
9147 2018-10-13 19:05:12 Why is there palm oil in it though?

9150 2018-10-13 19:05:02 I like the debate about competence. But @NOIweala was competent and yet Nigeria was reduced borrowing billions to pay SALARIES after record oil price period. She spoke/wrote about political will. Fashola & Kachikwu also competent. Why are they struggling? Theories v Reality 
9151 2018-10-13 19:04:58 This is what I was thinking too- palm oil wasn't so widely available some year ago, why not using something else? Anyway, at the moment I'm abstaining from palm oil- it's a challenge, I've noticed!
9152 2018-10-13 19:04:46 You needed us to invent the cell phone, internet, computers, social media, you’re using to voice these opinions. You need us to provide your males to become educated, you need us to make investments. The *only* thing that gives you any power is oil.

9162 2018-10-13 19:03:22 'African' Americans are like Cassius Clay. They changed Faiths to Muslim to hang out with the ones that scream Death to the Evil West and they should not be here as that is still what their Goal is. Christianity and Koran are Oil and Water. God promotes Love. They LOVE DEATH!
9163 2018-10-13 19:03:22 The point is Canada should pay more and stop producing oil.
9164 2018-10-13 19:03:10 Cheaper to hijack Venezuela oil then to be friends with pesky head choppers I guess.
9165 2018-10-13 19:03:08 He’s not a Christian but they fall for his snake oil.
9166 2018-10-13 19:03:04 Paul Stamets adds mushroom spores to the lubricating oil of the chippers to inoculate as you chip.

9169 2018-10-13 19:02:39 These were in fact the two engineers namely Zahid Mahmood and Mumtaz Ali Shah, working in Bitani Tribe area, for an oil company. The claim by HuA is false.

9172 2018-10-13 19:02:22 It's called capitalism. The strong companies buy out the smaller ones or they go out of business because they can't compete. Happens in every industry. Only a handful of oil companies left. Supermarkets. Hardware stores. Video stores, too before technology advanced.

9182 2018-10-13 19:01:29 This debate can go forever;we buy why we want with money. Everything in this world operates or has relation to “oil”. We can stop buying from you and go to Russia or China..etc and you can do the same . In a nutshell we don’t NEED you.

9192 2018-10-13 19:00:16 My dog ate all my coconut oil. Half of Costco size container. My husband his it from me FOR DAYS because he knew I’d be upset. #blackgirlproblems
9193 2018-10-13 19:00:08 Gotta keep dishing out the Tangerine Koolaid to his cult otherwise they might sober up and see the fuchead for what he really is. A snake oil salesman!
9194 2018-10-13 19:00:05 I’ve been off Buspar for 6 months now since I started taking CBD oil tincture.
9195 2018-10-13 19:00:05 If our Black Grandmothers were introduced too Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of artiery clogging Crisco and Lard they would still be around and healthy in their 90s.
9196 2018-10-13 19:00:04 One word - OIL. What will they do without Saudi oil? America saw the effect when the Saudi's cut supplies in the 1970's.
9197 2018-10-13 19:00:01 waddup iz ya boi extra virgin olive oil
9198 2018-10-13 18:59:19 I’m going to guess BigBoz stuffs his jock from his response. He also probably has a penis pump to “enlarge” his member. YES they actually make such things LOL I have no idea if they work but they also sell  enlarging creams right in the snake oil aisle at Walmart. LOL
9199 2018-10-13 18:59:12 shilling oil is really the cure
9200 2018-10-13 18:59:10 "…You anoint my head with oil…"
(Psalm 23:5, NKJV)
9201 2018-10-13 18:59:07 Anyone ever get an overhwleming urge to paint an oil painting?  Nah OK just me x
9202 2018-10-13 18:59:02 Saudi Arabia provided the allies with endless amounts of oil to defeat the axis powers during world war 2. Remember that too.
9203 2018-10-13 18:58:46 But the left would also ban fracking. On the whole, democracy is better off with foreign and domestic policy that lowers oil prices. 

Obama style, not left or Trump style.
9204 2018-10-13 18:58:30 Maybe it could lead up to the U.S.A. taking over their oil fields!!!  We are all voting RED soon!!!
9205 2018-10-13 18:58:29 Omg try tea tree oil, with a warm washcloth
9206 2018-10-13 18:58:27 Talking about sardines. I only eat canned sardines with olive oil. Good Bad?
9207 2018-10-13 18:58:21 It's a very confusing time for everyone. Do you wear a jean jacket or a leather jacket? Will your butt be cold? Should you wear a scarf? Why is the heater on? What to use as lotion now that the coconut oil froze over? We'll get through this together. #fall
9208 2018-10-13 18:58:20 Just whacked some Indian spices in a big bowl with a wee bit of oil and water for the chicken to marinade in and the veg is just cabbage, lettuce, onion, red onion, cucumber and tomato with a little olive oil, lemon juice and mint sauce 
9209 2018-10-13 18:58:18 You’re giving this up to work for OIL?!
9210 2018-10-13 18:58:18 I was like, listen I very much appreciate this diagnostic but I came only for this oil change lmao
9211 2018-10-13 18:58:14 In her ATA speech today, the Premier had a chance to finally apologize for ever appointing anti-energy zealot Tzeporah Berman to be her top oil sands advisor. Instead of just admitting a mistake, we heard more of the same excuses - and plenty of fear-mongering against the UCP.

9213 2018-10-13 18:58:09 We also buy millions of gallons of oil their exports to us are a hundred times higher than ours to them. Trump hasn't mentioned any tariffs there has he
9214 2018-10-13 18:57:58 They’re insane this year. I had to become THAT mom with sprays, bands, lotions  try creamy baby oil! They have it at target and the bugs HATE it.
9215 2018-10-13 18:57:55 Typical Democrat, Lie and deny.   Is healthcare the only talking point they have?  They created this disasterous healthcare, now they expect us to believe they are going to fix it? Ha! #WalkAway #VoteDemsOut
9216 2018-10-13 18:57:54 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
9217 2018-10-13 18:57:53 Apologizing is the best way to have the last word. The oil of an apology will heal a lot of friction.
9218 2018-10-13 18:57:51 As soon as the need for oil diminishes!

Just read that there’s estimated to 8.3 billion tons of plastic on our planet & 91% is NOT recyclable & will continue to pollute the planet for centuries. So we’ve extracted oil, polluted the air we breathe & the soil we use to grow our food. #idiots
9221 2018-10-13 18:57:32 Synthetic oil  and my car takes a lot smh  makes me wanna put the whole car back
9222 2018-10-13 18:57:31 The point is that maybe some small businesses are doing fine under a government with a socialist agenda but larger enterprises with more employees (ie: oil/gas) have not. The impact to Albertans is massive. It’s a simplistic view of things but it’s the truth
9223 2018-10-13 18:57:23 Inconvenient truth is to meet the new report recommendations Canada will need to totally get out of oil and gas shutting down 7-10% of Canada and 15% Saskatchewan GDP.  Meanwhile worldwide oil consumption will rise for many years to come as emerging economies and population grow
9224 2018-10-13 18:57:22 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen

9227 2018-10-13 18:57:12 i got gummies and the oil so we'll see!!!!
9228 2018-10-13 18:57:04 @zombiepubcrawl VIZ upgrade is the way to go. So many cool options to take him. How about some CBD oil and atomizer. Maybe a new pair of socks? 60 to upgrade from GA. Private bathrooms drink tickets and cool swag.
9229 2018-10-13 18:57:04 It’s all about the Oil Business 
9230 2018-10-13 18:56:57 De retour de la Marche pour le climat à Avignon. Qques 500 personnes défilant en se dandinant sur des rythmes brésiliens, les attablés des cafés sirotant un rafraichissement nous considérant d'un air amusé. Oui, c'est tragique. De tous les côtés, "haut" et "bas". Suis consternée.
9231 2018-10-13 18:56:55 What about shale or oil extraction  nearby?
9232 2018-10-13 18:56:44 After living in LA for almost four years, I've only noticed two discernible seasons. Coconut oil solid, coconut oil liquid.
9233 2018-10-13 18:56:42 тун-тун-тун, тун-дудун-тун-дудун!
9234 2018-10-13 18:56:39 Times like this when I cba to oil my scalp myself, I wish I had a readily available mcm to take this on
9235 2018-10-13 18:56:30 That’s not a good enough reason for sacrificing Vancouver and transforming it into a dirt oil shipping port from the amazing destination it is now for both tourists and residents.
9236 2018-10-13 18:56:25 He may not have done this to appeal to you and you might not have noticed it (indeed, some of his anti-environmental policies were intended to quietly appeal to the oil lobby) but he bears a lot of responsibility for our current crisis.
9237 2018-10-13 18:56:22 Rose oil..my friend makes a really good one and it's saved my hair..
9238 2018-10-13 18:56:02 Need some cuticle oil in my life
9239 2018-10-13 18:56:02 Lol I used to get those a lot. I just sent them all one of my essential oil debunk videos and none of them have ever contacted me again.
9240 2018-10-13 18:55:59 I went to get my oil changed and they started listing off everything wrong w my car and now I want to cry
9241 2018-10-13 18:55:44 harry styles definitely owns an essential oil diffuser
9242 2018-10-13 18:55:39 Anemmm!! Eu não testei o oil free e mesmo com a pele oleosa eu uso o normal e minha pele só melhorou
9243 2018-10-13 18:55:37 WAY past time to wean ourselves entirely off Saudi OIL and the floods of Saudi OIL money (not to mention Russian oil money) that deeply corrupt our politics. How much does the House of Trump owe to the House of Saud?
9244 2018-10-13 18:55:34 The @Richzeoli method of adding motor oil to a motor
9245 2018-10-13 18:55:28 At the dealer waiting as my car gets a bunch of service done. Spark plugs, oil change, air filters, light bulbs, 3 hours, and 2 continuing credits for CPC credential renewal.
9246 2018-10-13 18:55:18 Also a little fun fact for those of you trying to save the environment and what not, eating food and supporting brands who sell food with “Palm oil” is seriously killing our world :)
9247 2018-10-13 18:55:14 We got this like beautiful egyptian olive oil and wow. It really brings such like beautiful notes in hummus 
9248 2018-10-13 18:55:10 my mums giving me CBD oil am baffed
9249 2018-10-13 18:55:06 Yeah, I don’t believe in the Russia crap. The Saudis are waaaaay more destructive and we’ve been eating out of their hands for far too long. All for the love of oil.
9250 2018-10-13 18:55:04 Reagan gutted the department of the interior's energy programs and took the solar panels off the White House, and deepened the Republican Party's connection to the Oil Lobby. His EPA head was regularly sued and resigned in disgrace.

9252 2018-10-13 18:54:51 They may have had to, as the oil price nose dived from around $120 barrel to below $50 after the #IndyRef .  Also dependent like Brexit on negotiation, especially with Scotland wanting to retain £ Sterling as their currency.
9253 2018-10-13 18:54:46 It's there in the article. He passed legislation favorable to the solar industry, then after leaving governor's mansion, set up Silicon Ranch, got Shell Oil to buy in for 40 %. The proof is everywhere. Blackburn raises money for campaigns, he does for himself
9254 2018-10-13 18:54:45 Cost of living?   How about PST on kids clothes?   you raised my cost of living -- oh .. while giving you and the @saskparty a 3.5% raise … man up and work for the sask people .. not your next job in alberta oil fields..
9255 2018-10-13 18:54:23 I'm suspecting that PART of my nausea issue is the toasted weed, so I may not be the one to ask about this. There are caps available with purified oil that is easier on the nausea but harder on the gallbladder. 

Bodies are stupid.
9256 2018-10-13 18:54:18 #Didyouknow manhole covers in Japan are different from the ones found in the States? They are truly another extension of art! This is the last weekend to visit the California Oil Museum to explore the #500WackyFacts exhibit!
9257 2018-10-13 18:54:05 え↓ろ↑いなぁ
9258 2018-10-13 18:53:57 Ever heard of trucks?  How about heating in rail cars?  Asphalt oil is shipped this way all the time.  Back to the books @gronk9793 .  Stop looking for excuses why it can't be done and start thinking about possibilities.
9259 2018-10-13 18:53:49 Lol this weekend we all crashed resting to be fresh for 6am Monday. Mind body and spirit needs to recover. Yes oil is a 24/7 blessing to our country and its always someone's SHIFT. :)
9260 2018-10-13 18:53:45 They seem to want change but are frustrated by the negative way they have to go about it. The big forces in America including the gun and big oil lobbies, gerrymandering, and voter suppression, complicate the democratic process.
9261 2018-10-13 18:53:37 he had already chewed through his leg trying to get off and was bleeding everywhere :/ and since this is lowes the only oil things we sell are chemical based
9262 2018-10-13 18:53:12 I feel this needs to be recreated as an 18th century oil painting with appropriate attire.
9263 2018-10-13 18:53:12 May I be first to call them oil cunts?
9264 2018-10-13 18:53:07 1) pepper

9267 2018-10-13 18:53:05 Gah, that unfortunate limbo time between realising you just missed Doctor Who and whatever hour BBC One will put it up on iPlayer. Only lasted two minutes of the orange-art-materials video before going to sleep, though, so there’s that and the man who does the pretty oil pastels.
9268 2018-10-13 18:53:00 One word: oil
9269 2018-10-13 18:52:59 I need an oil change and some new socks. Might even get a large combo @CarlsJr for once. Oh and I'd actually be able to afford living here in San Diego without roommates!
9270 2018-10-13 18:52:57 I am too gay and beautiful to change the oil in my car by myself
9271 2018-10-13 18:52:51 1/ Coal is not oil and gas.
2/ There are countries other than the US, believe it or not.
3/ In 2015, total employment in oil, gas and petrochemical industries in the US (if we must look just there) = 1.39M people.
9272 2018-10-13 18:52:42 But I am killing 2 birds with one stone today. Getting new tires and oil changed
9273 2018-10-13 18:52:41 What's the thing that's like. Uh you can use this instead of this. Like you can use olive oil instead of eggs. What's that called?
9274 2018-10-13 18:52:39 Very interesting suggestion of resorting to production-sharing agreements like the ones in the oil and gas sector,  as well as being more active in furthering educational opportunities for local communities.
9275 2018-10-13 18:52:32 Oil?  They need us more...
9276 2018-10-13 18:52:31 Artichokes are the perfect food for cooking in an EPC. Drizzle with olive oil, sea salt, 1+ cup of water in the bottom, 15 minute setting. Dip leaves in drawn butters/lemon.
9277 2018-10-13 18:52:28 Thori sa oil sheshi ma mujy b dyna Kis chees ka friend hai tuu
9278 2018-10-13 18:52:24 Ohh Allah sarki  haba abin yayi yawa wlhy..
9279 2018-10-13 18:52:23 The U.S. EXPORTS oil. We shouldn't be subservient to oil producing nations.
9280 2018-10-13 18:52:01 While I understand the "someone else other than McDavid needs to score" narrative, at this point, they just need to find a way to get these two points. Chances are, if it's going to happen, No. 97 will likely be in the middle of it...so be it.  #Oilers
9281 2018-10-13 18:51:58 The Saudi’s rely on the US much more than we rly on them. No, they won’t start using Russian military equipment overnight, or immidetialy start selling their oil to Russia. Yes, they are an important strategical ally in the ME, but also need to be met with consequences
9282 2018-10-13 18:51:34 Is our own governments, federal and provincial, responsible for slowing Canada’s economy by trying to destroy the Alberta oil sands? No other reason for WCS being so low except for foreign and internal sabotage.
9283 2018-10-13 18:51:22 Nd no oil. That shit is like eating dry wall smh
9284 2018-10-13 18:51:20 I agree: we should re-configure our refineries to use our own oil from the "shale" formations and the GOM
9285 2018-10-13 18:51:17 I come to get an oil change and they tell me I need tire rods I'm like I know already just change my oil so I can go , I'll come back next week
9286 2018-10-13 18:51:16 Olive oil will get them off!
9287 2018-10-13 18:51:05 Like I’m only doing a hot oil treatment now.. will I sleep??
9288 2018-10-13 18:50:55 Big ‘meat’ is a myth. A Big Mac meal comprises maybe 15% (?) meat, rest is high carb low cost potato’s, oil, sugar, flour, salt & water, yet it’s the meat that makes the headlines!
9289 2018-10-13 18:50:43 At least 19 people are dead after a leaking oil pipeline exploded in southeast #Nigeria. The toll is expected to be higher after the weekend blast in the Osisioma local government area of Abia state. One explosion in 1998 in the #NigerDelta killed more than 1,000 people.
9290 2018-10-13 18:50:38 We don't need Saudi Arabia. Buy your weapons from Russia. We can block your country's participation in our markets. Only way you all survive is if you are allowed to sell us oil. Murderous regimes are not our values
9291 2018-10-13 18:50:34 What are you talking about? We now know all oil is bad. Wake up!!!
9292 2018-10-13 18:50:26 The State Oil company of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan aka the State if British Petroleum.
9293 2018-10-13 18:50:22 Yep...the Trumps are always involved in the money trail.  Also, China is the big new boy on the block...and they’ll happily buy Saudi oil.
9294 2018-10-13 18:50:20 olive oil is better than coconut oil for my hair.
9295 2018-10-13 18:50:11 If there’s a war between Saudi and USA, how will it affect the price of oil?
9296 2018-10-13 18:50:02 When you have oily skin, it's best to choose a cleanser with salicylic acid to fight excessive oil.
9297 2018-10-13 18:50:01 That's interesting! Coconut oil added and i got Ldl going up.
Do you know where I can read about this 4/4?
And what did you do about coconut oil? Simply didn't use it anymore?
Thanks.
9298 2018-10-13 18:49:46 Parent: Max can't come to YG because he has shingles.

Me: Did you try using oils?

P: Yeah, it didn't seem to help.

Me: Even the tea tree oil?!

P: Didn't even help a tiny bit!

Me: Wow, he's probably gonna die.

P: What?!

Me: Not from this, but the polio will def get him.
9299 2018-10-13 18:49:46 Water is more important than oil @OilGasCanada Water is being used by the industry and pollution is continuing w/o timely or effective remediation. Track record of NDP no better than Tapcal Trust Fund PCs. @Alberta_UCP going to be worse. Water will be the main problem in AB.
9300 2018-10-13 18:49:17 An open letter to whoever stole my car:
The clutch sucks, the battery barely starts so watch the lights if there on for too long you can use my friends jumper cables he let me borrow. Also the oil leak is horrible you might wanna get that checked.
9301 2018-10-13 18:49:12 
9302 2018-10-13 18:49:11 Before they found oil? There was no such thing as the middle East. It was all Africa.
9303 2018-10-13 18:49:08 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
9304 2018-10-13 18:49:06 so 3% of total oil prod - bigger effect than I thought
9305 2018-10-13 18:49:06 Putin asked Saudi Arabia to cut back on oil production to allow Russia to have there share so he can have his cut to steal more from Russia, he's getting low in his bank its dropped from $200 billion to $199.99 billion he's stolen since 1987
9306 2018-10-13 18:48:55 we have a history of methane gas problems.

seismic uncertainties.

people aint gonna send their kids to a school with a dangerous construction site under it.

insane.

9308 2018-10-13 18:48:33 Olives are pressed to get oil...

Fruits are squeezed for juice...

Flowers are crushed for perfume...

So, if you feel pressured, it's just Allah trying to get the best out of you!
9309 2018-10-13 18:48:31 With oil likely to hit $100/barrel in the 1st Qtr of 2019, India can't afford to initiate war. So relax folks!
9310 2018-10-13 18:48:28 Well, i love crispy curly kale ( bang in oven for 10 - 15 minutes with oil, salt and pepper ) 
So even though i haven't made this concoction i just know Crispy Curly Kale chocolate would be bloomin wicked, i mean it's it's like salted caramel only better right?! 
9311 2018-10-13 18:48:26 Mate, there's loads of things, solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower of the top of my head. Once you see how viable that is you can see why the oil companies are fighting to say climate change isn't real as they are the ones who will lose out
9312 2018-10-13 18:48:24 International prices are going down good but what abt prices in India..oil companies are daily increasing prices despite of declining international crude prices 
9313 2018-10-13 18:48:04 Ever wanted to start infusing some THC into your meals? Come check out our coconut oil, dosed out already so the work is done for you!
9314 2018-10-13 18:47:58 We actually even passed KSA a few years ago in oil production. (They may have caught up since, idk)
9315 2018-10-13 18:47:54 I think the prescriptions the NHS are hoping to offer will be oil based....
9316 2018-10-13 18:47:46 Mother Jones? Shit, you can't tell them from *the Onion*.
9317 2018-10-13 18:47:43 Oil, Eric. May I suggest you get "The Emperor Wears No Clothes. The economy could be hemp based. Fuel. Housing. Food. Clothing. Medicine. Bio degradeable plastics. Etc. You're a maths guy. Compute.
9318 2018-10-13 18:47:39 Until the Saudi oil runs out!

9323 2018-10-13 18:46:35 เคสแบบนี้ รู้สึกจะคล้ายๆคนที่เรากำลังพูดถึงกันมั้ยน้องออย 
9324 2018-10-13 18:46:26 I've always had a soft spot for the lovable wing-nut shaped hydrogenated vegetable oil shill, but he's never come round my house - so in the meantime it's serving as a fish pond.
9325 2018-10-13 18:46:18 I am confused about Bishop Kuka's visit 2 OBJ with Atiku. Does that mean he aligned himself with d powerful presidents he claimed were giving out oil blocks 2 their girl friends? I know PMB doesn't have oil block talk less of giving his girlfriend @ogundamisi @enzo_uzor @kakra68

9327 2018-10-13 18:46:14 The money they wasted on adding more seats is a bigger joke then Lucas Oil having a retractable roof. They have never ever come close to drawing enough people to fill the stadium before the remodel.
9328 2018-10-13 18:46:02 @LeoDochertyUK 2...and dentristy. Councils built thousands of quality homes which they rented out for a reasonable profit which was plowed back into the community, etc. I could go on. And all BEFORE the windfall of North Sea oil and gas. What is unrealistic?

@_yellowbeard_: Lou, i have the perfect product for you: The powder bra. Whenever you're too annoyed by you students yiu just slap your tiddies and it'll release a hell lot of powder, distracting your students so they can't see you so you can
9330 2018-10-13 18:45:59 Sir is this real olive oil or that has been produced by #SharjeelMemon on #CJ raid in hospital?
9331 2018-10-13 18:45:56 For my bday I just want an oil change for my car... it’s only $100
9332 2018-10-13 18:45:50 Headed to lucas oil speedway! Going to shake down the car and make sure we got the vibration fixed.

@thepetroleumllc @jeffreyspittel @Tino35440423 

Looks like a solid group of #oilandgas folks!

#oil #natgas #shale #energy
9336 2018-10-13 18:45:23 But how will we afford to buy oil pipelines we can't build from oil companies who also can't build them?
9337 2018-10-13 18:45:13 whereas you treat the economy and oil production as the same thing.
9338 2018-10-13 18:44:41 Big oil cheerleaders are not the issue. It’s scientist that keep their jobs from research funding from the governments that want climate change to be an issue for more tax revenues. Common sense people are realizing this. To bad the news only reports on the protesting hippies.
9339 2018-10-13 18:44:38 99% of British people have part of their pension invested in the oil/gas industry. I wouldn’t be surprised if you also had a similar investment.
9340 2018-10-13 18:44:35 Olive oil can help in lowering cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk of heart complications
9341 2018-10-13 18:44:14 Oil sanctions and 300 USD/bbl
9342 2018-10-13 18:44:07 I think some non vegans are scared of going vegan because they “don’t want to be stuck with a boring vegetable plate” at restaurants and parties  

Let me tell you, you sauté those veggies in some oil with a bunch of spices and BAM you got deliciousness.
9343 2018-10-13 18:44:04 Kalo aku oilnya di mix moist, baru obat jerawat. Kalo pake sleeping mask, berarti si obat jerawatnya tak liburin dulu. 
Tp orang2 ada yang oil baru moist, ada yang moist baru oil.
9344 2018-10-13 18:44:03 Subsidizing oil and gas?  How?
9345 2018-10-13 18:44:02 Oh yeah, globalists say invade Saudi Arabia and steal their Oil and Gas, isn't that what the NWO is all about, confiscating wealth by any means ...
9346 2018-10-13 18:43:58 How do you know the price of oil is gonna be going up forever? Do you really want to take that gamble? Doesn't seem like it's worth it
9347 2018-10-13 18:43:50 No because they are funded by the Oil Industry protecting its interests 
9348 2018-10-13 18:43:49 Is a better way to tackle the carbon tax issue is to mandate increased fuel efficiency for cars and other consumers of oil/gas - preferably in unison with the United States?  Discuss.
9349 2018-10-13 18:43:47 Hate and intolerance is the biggest obstacle to human existence. However, so are planes (on 9/11 grounding them for 3 days lead to 2 degree temp drop so), cars, meat eating, & prob rain forest destruction which humans are allowing to happen by not giving up meat and palm oil
9350 2018-10-13 18:43:30 well like it or not a large proportion of the world's economy depends on oil, so while we can and should try to phase it out, that doesn't really change anything about bitcoin's effects.
9351 2018-10-13 18:43:28 この時間のNHK、死後みたいな映像しか流れてない。
Olive Oilの「NHKみたいにぶっ飛ぶ映像朝まで眺めてる」ってこれか。
9352 2018-10-13 18:43:28 I'm getting my oil changed in my #Runicon and looking at #Trucks.  I see a truck in my near future.
9353 2018-10-13 18:43:28 But the owners have too much money to care for that. They even have oil wells.

9355 2018-10-13 18:43:11 What makes you an expert?  The man is an Uber engineer making amazing products.  Stop it with stupid speculation and FUD.     If you want to complain about somebody, start with Trump, a truly deranged person.  Or govts for being corrupt with oil money.
9356 2018-10-13 18:43:00 Meat/dairy companies' (as gross as oil&gas) toxic emissions come from production of crops to feed chickens, pigs&cows, methane emissions of burping/farting cows, farm equip fuel and production of animal meds and chemicals/toxic sprays to grow grain, palm oil &other food crops.
9357 2018-10-13 18:42:54 Yes. You will need b12 supplements. You can find them at any pharmacy. EPA & Dha can be obtained from @NordicNaturals #algae supplements without the toxins from fish oil!! You can get everything else from . Veges, fruit, grains, beans, legumes & nuts. But do consult with a dr.
9358 2018-10-13 18:42:52 I think he is far better than our highly qualified economists .. he explained Pakistan’s economy in 2 minutes .. what I gathered from it is that we shld focus on growing Chaawal Wheat Daals Vegetables & Sunflower & Mustard for oil and we can have cheap food for all.
9359 2018-10-13 18:42:43 Exactly... assuming Nigeria was exporting more than oil and creating most things locally relying little on import the current exchange rate or even a weaker naira would have been awesome. But most people think the naira must equal the dollar before we make heaven.
9360 2018-10-13 18:42:31 Like people come to Napa and indulge in the stupidest shit- u really need fucking $30 olive oil?? Tea towels?? WINE CHARMS
9361 2018-10-13 18:42:20 FPSO is a floating,production, storage and offloading oil vessel used in the drilling of crude offshore from the seabed to the surbsurface in the production of crude also known as rig.
9362 2018-10-13 18:42:18 Not as a market for oil?  Not as a source for quality higher education?  Not as an industrial and arms supplier?  Not as an ally?

It seems there is mutual need,.  The problem is that both our sets of needs are destructive in nature.
9363 2018-10-13 18:41:53 Friends of Science is Oil Industry propaganda - that’s who finds them. You know like the Sugar Industry did in the US to hide the health dangers of sugar on the body?
9364 2018-10-13 18:41:53 The 5 lefty PP setup is moronic. Agreed that 29 needs to be a lot better.
9365 2018-10-13 18:41:50 Remaining oil resources have different economics, prices rise to justify producing the lower quality @davey1233 @RichardTol @BjornLomborg
9366 2018-10-13 18:41:47 PDP looted d country dry during the period oil was sold over $120. Unfortunately,  some ppl for whatsoever reasons (hatred n greed)  want to force same jokers on us,  if u like get endorsement from witche/wizards, we aren't interested in PDP anymore...16yrs of foolishness is enuf

9368 2018-10-13 18:41:31 Hey @jimmyjohns I had some tasty jimmy peppers on my sandwich today, but I have a stomachache now... Any chance you could drop me a ingredients list? I found the allergen info online but I'm looking for something else. (I think I am allergic to truffle oil? But nothing else.)

9370 2018-10-13 18:41:24 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
9371 2018-10-13 18:41:23 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9372 2018-10-13 18:41:22 I still see that we are not doing enough with our arable land and human resources to stimulate agricultural productivity.

Holland is 20% the size of Niger state yet it made six times what we made from oil exportation in 2017.

We can get more from our lands
9373 2018-10-13 18:41:18 @POTUS himself said before, they can’t survive without US support for more than 2 weeks. Before the elections he even threatened to boycott Saudi oil. But something was changed after the elections

9375 2018-10-13 18:40:55 My new essential oil of the month is Jojoba oil
9376 2018-10-13 18:40:47 A) You're wrong.  B) So you're not even gonna attempt to apply their system with their oil and population tonthe US?  Don't blame you lol.
9377 2018-10-13 18:40:44 Dirty people are a great turn off 
9378 2018-10-13 18:40:34 Hell nah y’all be wasting the oil cartridge by hitting it extra hard
9379 2018-10-13 18:40:33 @BurtsBees  your blemish stick makes my skin feel like it’s on fire and it don’t do nothing, it literally don’t help or make the acne worst it’s just useless it’s honestly just sting oil step up your shit
9380 2018-10-13 18:40:27 My car saying I need a oil change but I just changed my oil & got a new battery 2 weeks ago

9385 2018-10-13 18:40:08 u need to use CBD oil
9386 2018-10-13 18:40:07 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
9387 2018-10-13 18:40:07 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9388 2018-10-13 18:40:02 No you do not! No Albertan political party takes any of this seriously. Your economy is based on resource extraction; not innovative technologies or novel ideas about science or engineering. It's about toxic oil & gas and farming.  You are all denizens of a 3rd world economy!
9389 2018-10-13 18:39:48 emerging adulthood is going to the grocery store with your mom while visiting home and her telling you to pick out anything you want and instead of getting candy immediately going for olive oil and toilet bowl cleaner
9390 2018-10-13 18:39:47 Oil change 
9391 2018-10-13 18:39:24 And how do you think the Alberta government is paying for that transition? 

They've spent BILLIONS of dollars in retiring coal-fired plants, grants for renewable energy and transit investments. Without world market prices for oil, they cannot afford to move forward on transition
9392 2018-10-13 18:39:23 The IPCC Report says we need to acieve zero fossil fuel use. That means not only transitioning out of our own fossil fuel industries, but ending Canadian purchases of Saudi & Russian oil as well. It's more of a challenge for our economy if we don't have a transition plan #cdnpoli
9393 2018-10-13 18:39:17 Just bought a new yoga mat think we should try it out someone bring the oil
9394 2018-10-13 18:39:11 @BBC_HaveYourSay Ukog and @angusenergyplc are having great finds in Weald basin.Oil for British energy independence. Why not look into this.
9395 2018-10-13 18:39:08 Hey @IcelandFoods good to see that you have stopped selling 5p bags, and stopping palm oil but how about making all of your own brand foods packaging recyclable almost everything I buy it says it’s not recyclable including the packaging on the bananas (they don’t need plastic)
9396 2018-10-13 18:39:06 Don't be afraid to cause a stink! It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil 
9397 2018-10-13 18:39:03 Fixed my car’s electric window motor, changed the oil and filter and also discovered an exhaust leak so I’ll need some filler to fix that as it’s on the manifold. Noticed an oil leak near two bolts on the rocker cover, so most likely need a new gasket.
9398 2018-10-13 18:38:56 How about your stock investments? How about oil? How about lots of instances?
9399 2018-10-13 18:38:50 Cbd oil isn’t psychoactive so it should be allowed in transdermal form!
9400 2018-10-13 18:38:43 Now that it’s cold out it’ll prob be a lot easier keeping the frizzle under control  it’s such a fuckin fine line between using JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OIL and then using enough to fry chicken 
9401 2018-10-13 18:38:41 Lavender oil on wrist pulse points before bed and 1 hot jaegermeister (if possible) as a nightcap. Or a hot cognac/ brandy/ whiskey with cloves. I find Jaeger works best as a headache cure and cold ward. Positive vibes to you!
9402 2018-10-13 18:38:39 For soup, cook minced onion in oil, then simmer with meatballs, oregano, mushroom broth and mushrooms. Top with mint.
9403 2018-10-13 18:38:37 Also they haven't nationalized their oil. The government owns 67% of the shares of Equinor the rest is publicly traded unlike Venezuela does with PDVSA. It's using capitalism to pay for social services and IT WORKS.
9404 2018-10-13 18:38:36 Worth noting tho, we no longer need oil from outside North America. We CAN cut this cord now if we are willing.
9405 2018-10-13 18:38:34 “There’s only one way to pass a drug test... it’s called an oil change”
9406 2018-10-13 18:38:33 I’m reformulating the beard oil I currently sell & offering more products for beard care starting November 1st! Dedicating the whole month to the fellas!
9407 2018-10-13 18:38:28 The Saudis do export exceptionally good dates... some would argue the best in the world. However, Saudi oil, fascism, religious intolerance and terrorism exports seem pretty fungible (to me).
9408 2018-10-13 18:37:54 Is this a puff puff that was denied enough oil.... Mokuuuuooo
9409 2018-10-13 18:37:53 No I mean, the fact that I'm vegetarian some 39 years doesn't help. 
I won't eat beef. Doing fish oil, b12 and eggs which is a big deal (!) May have to add fish.
9410 2018-10-13 18:37:43 I love the smell of snake oil in the morning.
9411 2018-10-13 18:37:33 Been using vitamin c oil for 6 months and see no change at all
9412 2018-10-13 18:37:32 Your outlook is about today and now and making agric the next forefront of our economy will take considerable time with pain. There is no miracle that can happen. The oil and gas sector that the economy depends on was not built in 4 years.
9413 2018-10-13 18:37:25 They’re scared because they let one stray too far off the plantation..  They’re worried too many more will follow.

9418 2018-10-13 18:36:48 Sir, "Lifeless" that is waking up the dead trains, paying pensions of over 24yrs, completing your party's abandon projects, saved $45B when crude oil was down to $30 per barrel, building roads etc. I love lifeless that can travel to USA and not under a siege. Welcome to tweeter.
9419 2018-10-13 18:36:46 Apparently Trump oil and oil from people who throw gay people off roof tops and murder journalists is less “evil.” It all makes sense now. Of course it does.

9421 2018-10-13 18:36:34 i need to get my oil changed but I don’t want to spend money but it’s gonna cost me more money to get a new car if I don’t and honestly I’d rather die than do either so
9422 2018-10-13 18:36:30 Isn’t that the truth
9423 2018-10-13 18:36:29 I suppose someone will quietly go and sell those boxes for half a Billion Rand and pocket the money. Like they did with our oil reserves. Then five years later tell us they are migrating & need to spend R20Million to buy new ones. Watch these corrupt skelms in action.
9424 2018-10-13 18:36:25 What? Oil and gas have don’t more to improve lives than anything I can think of. What are you talking about. Don’t demonize things just because.
9425 2018-10-13 18:36:24 Laxmi garu are you into Oil industry..With Engineering Background??
9426 2018-10-13 18:36:23 As @AndyBiotech pointed out, do you have a good explanation for why "mineral oil+statin" caused 17% hsCRP increase in anchor study after 12 weeks. What if we see similar increase in reduceIT?
9427 2018-10-13 18:36:11 That’s call Saudi stupidity. Generally modern Saudi brain cells work other way round “think after act”. Oil money cannot buy everything!!
9428 2018-10-13 18:36:08 every "what if we stopped credit cards/oil/television etc" analogy here is flawed, because it's hard to come up with something so completely without use that's also incredibly wasteful

9431 2018-10-13 18:35:50 Is it a coincidence that oil prices are back up to $70 a barrel again?
9432 2018-10-13 18:35:18 Deff was on my widely duties today . Babes system is fixed, directional fixed, appointment made for oil change on Monday because they was to busy today . 

& crazy part is .. I love doing shit like this for her, no damn complaints . 
9433 2018-10-13 18:35:12 Sounds eerily similar to last year's side. Then again, considering it is essentially the same roster we shouldn't be overly surprised.
9434 2018-10-13 18:35:05 Respectfully, I’d still like to hear your solution. Because frankly there’s no plausible future that doesn’t involve a strategic transition period to different energy sources, and that requires working *with* the oil and gas industry.
9435 2018-10-13 18:34:59 Low-ish heat, the oil spray builds a good barrier and it crisps nicely. Reminds of the butter but without the butter taste and heavy feel to it

Just make sure you respray the pan when you flip it the first time so each side gets coated.
9436 2018-10-13 18:34:57 really, it is clownish to think the people who rule USA are American or sympathetic to us; they are foreigners; Trump is a puppet on a string; real Americans are going to be happy that India buys oil from Iran in terms of rupees;  we are a captured nation, enslaved to our enemies
9437 2018-10-13 18:34:56 It's only a scammer that will tell me that a man who met foreign reserve depleted to #30billion and increased it to #47billion amidst comparatively lower oil prices has not achieved anything.

Dymatize and MuscleFeast are two main stream brands that check out (purity analysis), but any you know of would be great!

9442 2018-10-13 18:33:55 The simple answer is to build our own refineries in Fort McMurray the we would maintain control. Modern refineries will use supercritical carbon dioxide delivered at pipeline liquid grade from NE BC. sCO2 can also be used to extract oil sands more cleanly than steam.
9443 2018-10-13 18:33:52 A president has no real control over the price of oil - no president ever has. And there is no personal benefit to #Trump to lower oil prices. His only goal is self-enrichment and self-preservation. He'd burn down the country if it would further his personal goals. SCOTUS = proof

9445 2018-10-13 18:33:32 Colorado is voting in November on whether to require setbacks for oil and gas (2500 ft) and all the ads are “if you vote Yes you’ll ruin Colorado’s economy...” unbelievable.

9448 2018-10-13 18:33:25 A friend of mine from the 'ofe'mmanu' clan still can't understand how I haven't finished my 5-ltrs palm oil I brought from the village since January despite cooking bulk soups at least once a month. How do I tell her palm oil is for cooking & not drinking?
9449 2018-10-13 18:33:22 We are slow and cheat all the time
9450 2018-10-13 18:33:22 Got the oil diffuser blasting out some peppermint, basil and rosemary oils with the humidifier cranking. Lot of good air in my apartment rn.
9451 2018-10-13 18:33:19 It is estimated that approximately 19.4% (330,394bpd) of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico remains shut-in. It is also estimated that approximately 9.6 percent of the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is shut-in.

9452 2018-10-13 18:33:18 Yes of course. Over the counter fish oil is not the same as purified EPA (Vascepa) at higher doses (4g/d) used in REDUCE-IT. Reportedly, after a median f/u of 4.9 yrs, there was a 25% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events w/ Vascepa. Await full results.
9453 2018-10-13 18:33:18 Hard to argue with you there.
9454 2018-10-13 18:33:11 Keying the surface some how to help it stick. Spit sticks better than water. If you want to use oil, wipe the tool surface on your face. I never use anything else for fear of to much going on and working it's way under the GS. Hope that helps
9455 2018-10-13 18:33:08 He should take their oil. Start asking him if that's on the table.
9456 2018-10-13 18:33:04 Giving my locs a nice hot oil treatment
9457 2018-10-13 18:32:55 Our economic life line is still oil and once the industry is affected, the effect is felt in all economic sectors. Now, spend some time to read about the government cuts in oil based economies such as Saudi Arabia.
9458 2018-10-13 18:32:51 I would argue they just aren't that good of a lineup but have some really talented players.
9459 2018-10-13 18:32:50 Yo no necesito una hiperinflación para eso, no soy un cutre como Maduro. Lo voy a pagar en acciones de la Standard Oil Company.
9460 2018-10-13 18:32:49 Who is we?  Besides, there is not one single day in my life I have not thought about Armenians and their history.  Every single moment of my life, while playing hockey, eating hot dogs, and working the oil patch, I think of Armenians.
9461 2018-10-13 18:32:44 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures of the hard Brexit “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!”
9462 2018-10-13 18:32:35 The nail on the head: equating #GDP growth with #Productivity As long as oil flows and prices are good, #GDP looks real sexy, while our productivity heads south on oil illusion.

9472 2018-10-13 18:31:14 The government has no control over external economic factors such as oil prices. With the dramatic fall in oil prices, oil and gas companies across the world laid off workers. Research the number of oil and gas jobs lost in the North Sea (UK) and Alberta (Canada).
9473 2018-10-13 18:31:02 Nearly two periods in and all I can say is this Rangers squad isn't very good and at best the Oilers have played them even...not a real good sign
9474 2018-10-13 18:30:58 Birds of a feather! MBS has repeatedly shown his modus operandi. His Princes financed ISIS to genocide on Yazidi’s, Christians and terror bombings of Shia. Imprisoned disobedient Saudi’s and Lebanon’s Harari. Occasionally incites attacks on tankers or Tehran. To raise oil prices
9475 2018-10-13 18:30:55 That's pretty bad. But naked oil wrestling with Michael Moore is a #WorstNakedActivity too.
9476 2018-10-13 18:30:54 I love my car but everything is so expensive with mini coopers oil change , tires, because everything is different

9484 2018-10-13 18:30:01 I use Leave in conditioner a few times a week. Or i get a spray bottle fill it with tea tre oil, olive oil, Jamaican Castor oil and Shea butter and water and spray it on my scalp a few days out the week too !
9485 2018-10-13 18:29:50 The collapse of the American Empire will itself stop Global Warming. Global Warming is perpetuated primarily by oil, and oil is what backs the dollar. The collapse of the Dollar would end oil as a top commodity.
9486 2018-10-13 18:29:37 Sew and Disappoint are like Water and oil to me. They don’t mix when you patronize me.
9487 2018-10-13 18:29:25 Exactly, WE ARE NOT FOR SALE! WE ARE now the world’s largest oil exporter, exporting more oil than importing. There is no price we will accept to tip the scales of justice. An innocent human being, a perm resident, a jourbalist was dismembered for daring to speak on Trump & MBS.
9488 2018-10-13 18:29:24 You will once the pipelines get built. Oil money pays for the east coast buy off. You will be rich!!
9489 2018-10-13 18:29:22 Its the best way to run any club but especially as we'll never be able to compete financially with the oil clubs.

I see a lot of real prospects in the top end so investing in the defence (left side) seems appropriate.

Either way we have every reason to back Svens decisions
9490 2018-10-13 18:29:21 heres a wee hing on potential, Scotland will be ponying up about 16 billion to pay for trident it does not want, which prevents it from tapping oil and gas on the Clyde - we are literally, figuratively, financially and politically paying for ourselves to be fucking poorer.
9491 2018-10-13 18:29:00 World’s 5 largest meat/dairy companies combined, including Tyson, Cargill & Dairy Farmers of America, emit more greenhouse gas emissions/ year than any of the world’s biggest oil & gas companies, Exxon Mobil, Shell & BP. Animal Agri industry = water, air, soil pollution + CO2

9501 2018-10-13 18:27:38 If u still believe in govt functionality after complete derailment of Economy, then god knows what u defending or supporting.
The oil deregulation was reform, govt force OMC'S to bear the cut.. and see they looked out heavily.. don't know who got benefited at -25% price cut day..

9508 2018-10-13 18:26:15 All Mayo is is oil, eggs and vinegar. No matter what oil.
9509 2018-10-13 18:25:52 Not to mention it was also during peak oil prices, making a pipeline more profitable and cost effective.

9511 2018-10-13 18:25:46 I say quit importing their oil and stop exporting our oil

9513 2018-10-13 18:25:39 Looks like the ole Gus bus is leaking some serious oil!
9514 2018-10-13 18:25:38 Once I get on the oil Yunno I forget 
9515 2018-10-13 18:25:36 I read some projections that say by 2025 the US will be an energy exporter again for the first time since pre WW-II. Not sure about the role oil plays in that but we don’t really need the relationship with the Saudis like we used to.
9516 2018-10-13 18:25:35 It’s just that they are probably tired of being associated with the massacre in Yemen. KSA is heading for bankruptcy. Saudi has just accentuated is disdain for free speech - mob style. And besides the US has oil. Viable too @ $80+ a barrel.#RoyalShambles
9517 2018-10-13 18:25:29 @greggutfeld I don't care about any reporter for any damn news organization and I sure don't want to be punished with higher prices for gas and oil because of what may have been done to some damn reporter.
9518 2018-10-13 18:25:05 Yes. In 2008 at the peak of the oil price market, Brent crude was 122.50 and the average gas pump price was 1.48 per litre. Today the Brent price is 80.43 and the average gas price is 1.48. I am so happy to be receiving so much more value for my gas. NOT.
9519 2018-10-13 18:25:04 Or another oil did u read that part?
9520 2018-10-13 18:24:54 Then maybe you should ask the judge who jailed the 3 fracking  protesters of his familys extensive oil and gas connections and maybe ask if there was a conflict of interest in his sentencing of these 3.
9521 2018-10-13 18:24:53 @jesse_b_waters I don't care about any reporter for any damn news organization and I sure don't want to be punished with higher prices for gas and oil because of what may have been done to some damn reporter.
9522 2018-10-13 18:24:47 Not to mention Norway has pipelines and off shore oil exploration up the ying yang
9523 2018-10-13 18:24:46 Keeps the World/Russian oil price higher.

9531 2018-10-13 18:23:44 One needs to understand the basic economics . It is not the prices of crude oil but the high slab of duties and taxes on the finished product are not adversely affecting only the consumers but are going to hit hard the automobile industries and their ancillaries .
9532 2018-10-13 18:23:43 True. Not oil. Not sand. Not murderers.

9538 2018-10-13 18:23:02 If the Saudi leadership decided to sell the oil with other currency , hell will get loose to KILL the $ ..
9539 2018-10-13 18:22:40 I like to wake up, make myself a nice hot cup of tea or coffee & then take up to a gram of cannabis oil & just lay there in pure bliss

9541 2018-10-13 18:22:25 The Saudis have been buying American military equipment for decades. They cant just switch over to flying Russian airplanes overnight.  They also cant sell their oil to Russia. They are much more dependent on us than we are on them.
9542 2018-10-13 18:22:21 OIL addiction means too many look the other way while vicious thugs ruthlessly ruin the lives of millions - Saudi frienmies - enough
9543 2018-10-13 18:22:15 KPLC and rains is like water and oil. The miracles happening in some parts of Kiambu . I have just experienced two short-circuits along Kiambu Road 
9544 2018-10-13 18:22:13 Go ahead and punish them for bombing us on 9/11 while you are at it.  We don’t need their oil any longer... frac baby frac!!!
9545 2018-10-13 18:22:03 Yep, same here, switched to whole fat  milk products, raw milk, lots of eggs, coconut oil was a drink for me. Never worked  but when you adopt this 'religion', it's like, 'give it a time', 'do it' harder'.....
9546 2018-10-13 18:21:58 I can’t believe Big Oil is letting the scam stay alive! They’re losing market share to renewables every year yet they do NOTHING! They’re silent while they lose business? Why?
9547 2018-10-13 18:21:51 Absolutely. Remember Saudi cutting oil prices to retain market share back in 2014?
9548 2018-10-13 18:21:50 Roti is tandoor

9549 2018-10-13 18:21:38 1. From a tandoor, most probably.
2. Has maida and oil is used while preparing.
3. Dry, no use of oil.
9550 2018-10-13 18:21:20 Check into the CBC oil, if you haven't already. I know numerous people who are getting relief from pain using it, I am one. I hope you find the relief you so deserve. Stay strong!

9554 2018-10-13 18:21:08 @javeednusrat how ever I tend to agree with Nusrat Sb that Trump may use this for arm twisting of MBS to keep oil prices in check
9555 2018-10-13 18:21:05 Cutting one’s use of oil undermines oil prices & cashflow.

9559 2018-10-13 18:20:32 Sadly, when one side seeks to destroy an industry (see: “leave the oil in the ground”) that for many yrs employed huge # of working Canadians and financed much of the country’s welfare state, that does not create trust for a compromise.
9560 2018-10-13 18:20:30 Kids have to start somewhere. Attitude is everything. I always say if you don't have a teachable spirit, you won't learn anything. You have to have the desire to learn and make the most of your opportunity. When I started in oil & gas, I did a lot of grunt work  Willingly.
9561 2018-10-13 18:20:24 Sorry Katie but #Brockham has not flowed from the Kimmeridge at all. You are mixing it up with the Portand . Let's hope it flows as without oil a production licence is worthless.

9564 2018-10-13 18:20:00 Maybe Draisaitl had too much red meat last night in NYC...hasn’t won a puck battle all afternoon and looks sluggish. He needs to be better. #Oilers
9565 2018-10-13 18:19:51 Fixed: America’s Saudi Arabia problem.  

I think POTUS, lobbyists, senators, oil companies, etc. maybe a bigger problem here than Uber having a 10% owner. What are they going to do? Make Uber drivers go around in circles?

I am all for SV standing up but keep some perspective.

9568 2018-10-13 18:19:33 My least favorite thing to wait for is my oil to get changed.
9569 2018-10-13 18:19:23 The local garage kept making bizarre excuses for why they couldn't change my oil. My guess is the guy has more customers than he knows what to do with.
9570 2018-10-13 18:19:19 And the huge oil, coal and gas companies owned by middle-eastern or Chinese/Japanese people????

9575 2018-10-13 18:18:56 Apart from the biggest arms sale in history, oh and oil, at least its relative stability of price... Oh and maybe at least one other ally in the middle East.. Apart from that you might have an argument.
9576 2018-10-13 18:18:52 IMO, it's already started. (I think that the destabilisation of the middle east and fights over oil are related at well.)
9577 2018-10-13 18:18:50 If I recall, cats aren't fan of citrus-y smells. So, if you're okay with smelling a bit fruity, could try an orange oil spray or something to make the clothes less desirable to pee around?

9587 2018-10-13 18:17:57 Gotta get my cars oil changed today but I’m lazy
9588 2018-10-13 18:17:52 THIS. 

"Does it make sense for Canada to hold our own economy hostage while countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia can seel their oil around the world? Countries who don't care one wit about climate change? 

Of course it doesn't." @RachelNotley #AbLeg
9589 2018-10-13 18:17:47 What happened to the planet's fever?  Are the Miami shores receding due to rising sea levels?  If oil HAS been a scarce resource since the 1970s,  why haven't we run out yet & bankrupted the Middle East?  Wait a minute!  Emergency!  Raise taxes on the rich into the outer galaxy!
9590 2018-10-13 18:17:46 Dems grooming him for President?
9591 2018-10-13 18:17:42 We spilled oil on the hot stove. It lasted like 30 seconds
9592 2018-10-13 18:17:38 I *almost* feel sorry for the idiots replying to this tweet who are buying up this political snake oil.
9593 2018-10-13 18:17:17 ขอบคุณคร้าาาา
9594 2018-10-13 18:17:09 ไม่เคยรักใครแบบนี้มาก่อนจริงๆนะเว้ย เราแบบอยากรักษาเขาไว้มากๆอะ ถึงเขาจะมีบาดแผลเล็กนิดเดียว เราก็อยากดูแลเขาอะ
9595 2018-10-13 18:17:09 he cant , and no one can ,, they should appreciate Saudi patience and wisdom dealing with this conspiracy,, just imagine if saudi stop oil supply to the world .
9596 2018-10-13 18:17:07 Sadly I don’t think we can quite compare ourselves to extremely wealthy Norway anymore. 

Not that Scotland’s oil is all gone. Lots of it left. But I think the opportunity of the boom time has gone. 

Time for green energy revolution anyway.
9597 2018-10-13 18:16:59 for me , its enough criminal andd political news, I've been hedging in fundmentals and commodotiess and after couple of hours the world will hedge in Oil. Trump is concerned about his Economy and its time to look after Mine.
9598 2018-10-13 18:16:55 Its confusing, customs is raking record breaking revenue, same with FIRS, crude oil remains high, exchange rate is high yet we keep piling up debts
9599 2018-10-13 18:16:51 I'm at 3% oil life after 5900 miles in our Impala since last change. Since my normal auto shop isn't open on the weekends, having to visit @valvoline. At least I found a @groupon for it!
9600 2018-10-13 18:16:46 Oil change place tried to tell me there’s too many miles on my truck
9601 2018-10-13 18:16:43 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
9602 2018-10-13 18:16:39 Don’t think energy explains it. We import ~5x as much oil from Canada as we do from Saudi Arabia.
9603 2018-10-13 18:16:32 I would love to cover that incredible body in baby oil and make it shine and maybe wrap it up in saran wrap for added kink.
9604 2018-10-13 18:16:21 Do you slurp? Because I tooooootally show off that I know how to really taste olive oil. I’m like a total dick about it.
9605 2018-10-13 18:16:14 like i see her every day but  i miss her babying me when i'm sick & rubbing baby oil on me after my bubble baths & massaging my feet til i fall asleep & rolling my blunts for me & shit 
9606 2018-10-13 18:15:56 Last time I checked, Republicans support coal & oil companies (who still to this day get govt subsidies!!) they support big expensive houses & cars & couldn’t care less about conserving land, water or energy. At least, thats what it looks like when you review their policies.
9607 2018-10-13 18:15:52 Important point by @RachelNotley, overlooked by anti-pipeline activists:

"Building a new pipeline to the West Coast will not increase emissions from our oil sands.

A new pipeline will simply increase the return we all get for the resources we as Albertans all own." #ableg

9614 2018-10-13 18:15:24 Yeah we need their oil you fool
9615 2018-10-13 18:15:23 Why? What USA could give to Saudi Arabia that anyone else couldn't? Spoiler - nothing. But Saudi can give to USA cheap oil. So far.
9616 2018-10-13 18:15:04 Driving west on Trans Canada, seeing all the trees uprooted & mountains chewed up I wonder where are all the #pipeline protestors now? We're building new asphalt roads for oil/gas driven vehicles to drive on. #convenientactivism
9617 2018-10-13 18:15:03 Putting oil on after exfoliating and shaving is amazing! I feel 10x smoother and hydrated
9618 2018-10-13 18:15:02 No, its about protecting the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian terrorists that want economic control to spread extreme Islamic rule to the Middle East. The US doesn't need Saudi oil or money.
9619 2018-10-13 18:15:01 $50 to anybody that can change my oil lmao
9620 2018-10-13 18:14:55 In that oil... Yep!

There is something for you broke little boys to do too . Send payment confirmation too.  #findom #findomme #finslave #finsub #paypig #ebonydomme
9622 2018-10-13 18:14:50 Better to have this stuff found and dealt with during construction than left as a surprise. I'm old enough to remember when there were flames coming out of the sidewalk one day in 1985 in front of the Farmer's Market on Fairfax. It was an oil field in the early 20th Century.
9623 2018-10-13 18:14:50 No. We’ll continue to buy their oil. They’ll continue to buy arms from us. Nobody will criticise the vile Saudi regime. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it.
9624 2018-10-13 18:14:42 Cruz is part of the oil conglomerate that only want to retain control over those who struggle every day!

9627 2018-10-13 18:14:14 I Have To Get More Black Seed Oil Today!
9628 2018-10-13 18:14:12 I was supposed to pick my oil from weeks ago up today but can’t cause ~somebody~ turned a quick lil homework sesh into 10 hours.
9629 2018-10-13 18:14:10 Right. So what? Obama interfering in Libya to overthrow "bad" guy didnt work out well. Neither did US in Iraq. Do we really want another failed state there w/such oil riches?
9630 2018-10-13 18:14:00 Because he has a better chance in some of those other states (even without being on the ballot)?
9631 2018-10-13 18:13:59 Asi munototenga mitsengo yenyama ine mafuta kuitira pakubika pacho. But kuma avocado and Sesame seed oil tagara tisinga kukwanisi zvedu. Iwo the likes of Olive oil yakakwirawo seyi for comparative needu ejekerere pure drop.
9632 2018-10-13 18:13:57 The US gov invented womd in Iraq and had no qualms about invading for oil when the leader wouldnt co op. Why not now ? Half the US military is within a day of Saudi. The Kindom could fall by the end if the weekend
9633 2018-10-13 18:13:56 Teachers shouldn’t parent
9634 2018-10-13 18:13:51 I really don’t feel like going to get this oil change
9635 2018-10-13 18:13:50 NO herds R NOT over-populated. Their PROTECTED land HAS BEEN taken away in time. Propaganda-LIES of Bureau of Land Management about over-population & starvation was 2 REMOVE #wildhorse & #burros 4 Big Beef-'special interest' 4 big oil #publiclands at risk 2- #Horses R SCAPEGOATED
9636 2018-10-13 18:13:46 First off the oil belongs to Albertans not the feds and secondly the funds generated for equalization payments  is largely made up of oil revenue which already supports our social programs including education
9637 2018-10-13 18:13:30 Rainy day fun!   Better baking soda than cooking oil of choice.  :)
9638 2018-10-13 18:13:28 Snake oil salesman plain and simple and the dems hitched their wagon to him and now trying to cut him loose. Demonstrates how they don't have core values just vehicles to push power agendas.
9639 2018-10-13 18:13:24 Would CBD oil really count as a "drug" knowing it has no psycho active effects though?

9644 2018-10-13 18:12:47 Do you think you’r the only source of weapons in this world??
Alternatives are already available. 

I suggest you stop using SAUDI OIL
Opps you can’t make weapons without SAUDI OIL.
9645 2018-10-13 18:12:40 The power structure goes like this Rothschild bank/oil > CIA/Mossad/MI6 > paid mercenaries (Isis, Al nusra etc) > regular national military (USA marines etc). Go to the source - the Zionist central banking cartel. #genieenergy is a good place to start regarding Syria
9646 2018-10-13 18:12:38 Phew good I’d rather chop my hands off than get them drenched in oil
9647 2018-10-13 18:12:37 Even I've left the Lamp Oil technically in the morning :-D
9648 2018-10-13 18:12:36 Don’t forget the tiki torch oil! Wouldn’t want your delicate hands to get dirty.

So, stay hydrated, & avoid licking the lips.

9652 2018-10-13 18:12:16 “We’ve also capped oil sands emissions - capped them by law, so new pipelines don’t mean more greenhouse gasses - a fact that sometime gets lost in the debate.” - @RachelNotley debunking more Alberta energy myths at ATA Conference. #ableg #abndp #abpoli #abed
9653 2018-10-13 18:11:42 No Clare, the Lamp Oil is around the corner. In fact I'm in it now writing to you right now, shaking off an awful day at F sodding C :-(

9655 2018-10-13 18:11:37 Fix the oil price problems and we will talk of environmental issues. Why won’t you see that Albertans are suffering for leadership not more issues. Oh well don’t listen and see what happens next year sayanora adios and good bye
9656 2018-10-13 18:11:32 Mishka, your cousin obviously knows nothing about that Van! It’s been nominated for and won numerous awards! To many to mention. Most Oil changes of 2006-7 for instance. Smelliest around 2012?

9658 2018-10-13 18:11:15 I biked 18 miles yesterday and now I can’t walk today. Idiot Rogan keeps talking about how great this is making us feel. “Then fucking fly here and carry me around, cunt breath! I can’t fucking move!” CBD oil would work really well now, but no. My friends are all assholes.
9659 2018-10-13 18:11:12 sounds like an commercial from that oil company
9660 2018-10-13 18:11:08 They are bought by big oil and Putin has his kompromat.
9661 2018-10-13 18:11:07 "Building a new pipeline to the West Coasts will not -- I repeat WILL NOT -- increase emissions from our oil sands." says @RachelNotley, a point often overlooked by anti-pipeline activists. #ableg #TMX
9662 2018-10-13 18:10:58 You need CBD oil. It is legal in all 50 states, non narcotic, etc.. ingest as much as you can and keep the level up for as long as possible. It is a miracle drug.
9663 2018-10-13 18:10:57 Hey... They did not specify it had to be a permanent tattoo and not a temporary one. Go get your 2 free oil changes man!
9664 2018-10-13 18:10:44 Do you want to compare the amount of slams in Israel to the Arab world?!
Even the Arab countries that have oil still have slams...
Your comparisons show how much you suffer from low self esteem 
You envy at Israel that managed to have a great economy and technologies...
9665 2018-10-13 18:10:42 The advantages of building a refinery in Fort McMurray are its proximity to the oil sands. If we generated electricity in Northeastern BC with pipeline ready, clean liquid CO2, that could prove useful for extracting oil sands cleanly.
9666 2018-10-13 18:10:28 I need an oil change
9667 2018-10-13 18:10:24 So I'm at the oil change spot and the lady in the vehicle next to me smoking big cigarettes like all of this shit floating around us isn't flammable 
9668 2018-10-13 18:10:22 That's good. The oil has been helping me with my stomach issues so I'll definitely look into the other products
9669 2018-10-13 18:10:20 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
9670 2018-10-13 18:10:11 Got the lawn mowed, maybe for the last time. Really need to change the oil in my pickup but it’s chilly and the truck doesn’t fit in the garage. Guess it will wait for another day.

9674 2018-10-13 18:10:02 Nice things aren’t free, god damn. Just spent almost $700 on a new alternator for my car and gave it an oil change  fuuuuck it! Next up, new rims! #CadillacCTS
9675 2018-10-13 18:09:55 So your not entirely wrong, although not entirely right. Historically Alberta has invested in oil and gas, more recently with the oh so loathsome NDP they have diversified. Weird.. how their hated so yet seem to be making it so that Alberta isn’t a single revenue province
9676 2018-10-13 18:09:50 Except they don’t. Why do they live in slums in the Al Ahsa region despite having the vast majority of the country’s oil wealth, why can’t they hold important government positions in civil service, or the armed forces. I can go on and on, and I’ve seen it with my own eyes.
9677 2018-10-13 18:09:37 What's the point of Having a that oil if you can't manage it?
9678 2018-10-13 18:09:35 All liberals complain about bud oil I’d like to condemn big education
9679 2018-10-13 18:09:28 Make same chips using oil. You know, boiling hot oil. Take my advice, just don't do it. It may turn potatoes golden brown, but it will also turn your skin all kinds of red and pain.

I don't knw where the government expects us to get the USD from, as for basic commodities OK had no bread, mazowe cooking oil..went there hopeful after some of these tweets & was disappointed

9683 2018-10-13 18:08:56 A myth to the man who owns it
A fear to the venture that capitalizes on it.
More than a fickle attempt at tickling it.

The payload is expulsion of ecstasy without the need to polish the submarine. 
Now that's what I call a G-Spot!

9685 2018-10-13 18:08:33 I really question that the current US-Saudi relationship is a result of oil dependency.

US oil consumption in 2017: 20 mb/d
US oil production in 2017: 9.3 mb/d
US oil imports - Canada: 4mb/d
US oil imports -  Saudi Arabia:  0.955mb/d

Saudi Arabia is 5% of US oil imports.
9686 2018-10-13 18:08:32 LOVE THE SONG I remember pre 55 when 70 was tops though cops were few and far between. They were after criminals instead of commercial paper prior to 72 exit from gold to write commercial paper. Pres Carter,55, save oil (sure...) now west Tex@ 85!
9687 2018-10-13 18:08:31 they don't give a damn about what the west thinks and we know they believe we are weak because they have a very different set of values from our own and esp. the royal familie! And no one dares to hold them accoutable because of oil and money! #wewantanswers
9688 2018-10-13 18:08:26 I'd prefer to cut all aid to the Saudis, because that's an evil authoritarian regime...but I guess that since they have oil, our government thinks that's just A-OK.
9689 2018-10-13 18:08:24 I feel like such a dweeb getting my oil changed at a shop.
9690 2018-10-13 18:08:16 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
9691 2018-10-13 18:07:52 Good afternoon Sherry and Ladies! Kisses for you all! Oil never sleeps!
9692 2018-10-13 18:07:50 Business idea:  Let's employ mostly children to work around hot oil and stoves with sharp knives in a high stress environment that involves the exchange of cash and requires good sanitation.  Let's add a high volume of customers and pay them very little.  Brilliant. #FastFood
9693 2018-10-13 18:07:46 Here’s 2 pictures. One from 2010, one from 2016.  It does show that Alberta has become more diversified.. under the current NDP gov. Previous to that, it was clearly single minded  having 25% of the economy reliant upon oil and gas.
9694 2018-10-13 18:07:32 Don't oil too much, ye govt jayega to Tera ghar mey bhi raid hoga....sala tax chor.

- Proverbs 21:17
9696 2018-10-13 18:07:09 Here is a poll question for someone to set up, ask what the price of oil is in Alberta. Then have a poll on some Edmonton Oilers stat. I bet few Canadians know the Alberta price of oil, most know some irrelevant Oilers stat. Canada expects gov to take care from womb to tomb.
9697 2018-10-13 18:07:08 Yet the fears of avoiding trade and business deals with Saudi only worry a select few in this country, and that they might become washed out of the markets (oil).
9698 2018-10-13 18:07:05 They pulled out because they don’t invest unless they know they will get to the finish line. And now we sell our oil for 30$ a barrel and buy it for 70. Wind farms are subsidized by taxpayers or they wouldn’t be built. Oil profits help pay for it but we don’t have that now..
9699 2018-10-13 18:07:03 I guess you are all dreaming of big oil,worst kept secret ever,new technology,deep drilling w/submersibles,gonna be a new Brunei,?and where to take it..ah,any south American state that will take the money,process,no wonder british govt.courting new trade zones in that area..
9700 2018-10-13 18:06:57 2. I will add that the holdouts on climate science are almost ALL paid by big oil and coal. They aren't in the public (government funded/academic) sector. The rest have their hair on fire because now, if they can't WALK BACK the carbon levels, we are in for disaster.

9710 2018-10-13 18:05:55 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
9711 2018-10-13 18:05:55 The Saudis concluded that because of trade, arms sales, oil and intelligence sharing no one will do anything.
9712 2018-10-13 18:05:53 What can't you believe bro... The unnecessary oil price increament, the return of subsidy without no reason, idp case? Which one please?

9716 2018-10-13 18:05:45 Watch the people, they can only reproduce what they contain

On Twitter here, Paddy Adenuga shared his 'almost takeover of an oil major

People with father's like mine started to ginger

While I'm all for aspiring

But we must never ever take out context

Never ever!
9717 2018-10-13 18:05:42 Keeping records of gov't project on excel spreadsheet itself is illegal (not an auditable tool). That was how crude oil loading records was kept on excel spreadsheet during their period. Thanks to @MBuhari who introduced auditable tool.

9718 2018-10-13 18:05:42 You are very eloquent. She was against pipelines and the oil sands.
9719 2018-10-13 18:05:41 How did he get oil on his head? Most cats fight other cats and birds.  Not cyborgs.
9720 2018-10-13 18:05:36 At this rate my weight is going I should just drink oil sua LOLOL
9721 2018-10-13 18:05:35 Flake is a snake oil salesman! I  believe NOTHING that comes out of his mouth, including his PHONY PIETY! It’s all for the cameras !!!
9722 2018-10-13 18:05:31 Yup crossroads game for the Broncos tomorrow. A win and they’re still in it. A loss and I see another spiral. Oil really need a win. Decent first period. Need Nuge to keep contributing.
9723 2018-10-13 18:05:18 No, it’s a Yemeni hot sauce - I’ve put a tad too much oil in mine, but it’ll do :)
9724 2018-10-13 18:05:16 You have a president that doesn’t understand basic economics,implementing socialist policies,looking for oil in the desert and sadly unhealthy.
9725 2018-10-13 18:05:15 iyaa ini udah pake bio oil, tadinya parah bgt sebelum pake itu. apa karena gue males-malesan make kali ya  ok dermatix bakal dicoba. Makasih ya!
9726 2018-10-13 18:05:04 I would say that if you chart oil, dollarization, and weapons, you're halfway there--better than most. People need to understand destruction and depopulation is profitable smash-and-grab for 'declining' US empire. But politics must be understood first, starting with Palestine.

9728 2018-10-13 18:04:36 It’s a consensus that differentials are an issue.  I seriously doubt those companies you listed are pumped and optimistic about the future.  Now....all heavy oil or oil sands plays are not equal, regardless, the huge concern over lack of market access is valid, and is being felt.
9729 2018-10-13 18:04:34 It doesn’t when your net spend is about £150m and another club is spending half a billion net, with dirty oil money supplied by human rights-abusing owners...
9730 2018-10-13 18:04:16 I earned my salary thanks. Selling oil like selling cocaine. Lots of profit for a few, pain for the rest.
9731 2018-10-13 18:04:14 Oh, I thought you were mentioning the Oil.  Honest mistake as they were playing like a minor league team.
9732 2018-10-13 18:03:59 olive oil is legit and doesn't taste like olives as far as I can tell.

9736 2018-10-13 18:03:34 Just curious, is there any video of your promoting Alberta oil in your first three years??? Or are you just doing this now to try and save your position as premier?? We already know your campaign is going to be all Fear and Smear and zero substance.
9737 2018-10-13 18:03:23 Yet, I heard yesterday that the US is on target to produce more oil than Saudi Arabia some time soon? Is that true?
9738 2018-10-13 18:03:22 The main stream media. But guess what democrats in droves the walk away movement is growing by the thousands because the Democratic party is long gone and people don't want what socialism provides = Murder=starvation=Poverty= Venezuela perfect example a oil rich country
9739 2018-10-13 18:03:21 Use coconut oil next time.. Trust me, it helps 
9740 2018-10-13 18:03:19 What is it? An oil?
9741 2018-10-13 18:03:09 MSM colluded to use exact messaging. Social media is doing the same thing. TIme for anti-Trust laws to be enacted. They did it with phone co, oil co, and others.

9754 2018-10-13 18:01:46 Not particularly. The pam olive oil spray adds a nice flavor when cooked in the pan. I never used butter or mayo - hence the spray. Just give the pan a nice coating and then respray once when you flip.

9760 2018-10-13 18:01:03 Imagine a system where I lit a barrel of oil on fire in my yard, and then was awarded a token for doing so. That is literally what bitcoin is!

Compare to a system where I used the barrel of oil to move people to a place, or even use the energy to warm them for winter.

9772 2018-10-13 18:00:24 I think it's good for absorbing oil and stuff, it's just that it won't "brighten" (I guess that's a claim that's made?).

I'm assuming the claim might be because it could exfoliate? 
9773 2018-10-13 18:00:14 I dont know the difference between regular & synthetic oil. Lmaooo asking me these questions is a sign of disrespect

9784 2018-10-13 17:59:14 Nope that the Canadian economy is losing a lot in the oil and gas industry and the retweet was more or less ppl who are invested in oil or gas Canadian companies and don’t see the failing of the market. Nows a good time to move your equity out of Canadian oil and gas industry!
9785 2018-10-13 17:59:11 It's not that they're stupid, it's just that they had more immediate survival concerns for the majority of their lives.  It was far more important to know how to look for landmines without getting blown up in Vietnam during war time, than know the science behind oil production.
9786 2018-10-13 17:59:04 If US oil companies would stop exporting oil and keep it at home, we wouldn't need oil from other countries.
9787 2018-10-13 17:58:48 I ran out of coconut oil for my hair and I needed it rn 
9788 2018-10-13 17:58:42 He doesn't  care! Simple as that. I know ppl from Standing Rock. The Indians are furious. A quarter of a million hals of oil sent into their streams,how sad is that? We take America away from them n now we destroy what they have left. Yep freedom at it's  best, haha
9789 2018-10-13 17:58:41 Oh please. I grew up in McMurray and my husband still works there but she’s not wrong. Oil is going the way of coal. The question is when.

9793 2018-10-13 17:58:06 Yep. Almost as hard as finding a man in the oil/natural gas industry who doesn’t refer to you as his “ol lady”.
9794 2018-10-13 17:57:55 Really? That assumes no change in behaviour on the part of oil consumers, treating them like lemmings falling over the cliff of #climatechange. Not good enough. We need a plan to transition out of fossil fuels, and we don't need TMX.
9795 2018-10-13 17:57:53 America needs to boycott any, & all companies that still plan to attend the Saudi "Business Conference" planned!

America needs to stop importing Saudi oil!

NO more U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia the Country that fomented Osama Bin Laden & most,if not all, of the 9/11 terrorists!!
9796 2018-10-13 17:57:52 Without oil, Alberta would be just like the other provinces in Canada. Not fantastic, not horrible.  But with oil, their economy is far above all the others.  Is that what the rest of Canada is jealous about?

9806 2018-10-13 17:56:56 What's being done to Alberta's oil industry is almost treasonous, it's certainly a betrayal of the interests of the vast majority of Albertans and ultimately all Canadians.
9807 2018-10-13 17:56:54 I'm bored, I haven't moved since yesterday and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
9808 2018-10-13 17:56:51 its oil fields and methane gas pockets. seismic center. why cant they move it one block.

this is true insanity.
9809 2018-10-13 17:56:50 nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil

9812 2018-10-13 17:56:30 Many landlords here grew up in developing countries. You're asking them to have education about, and prioritize the climate. That's a big ask.  My husband's parents still don't know where oil comes from. When I told them it came from dinosaurs they thought it was a joke.
9813 2018-10-13 17:56:27 $150 for a oil change, shitting me

9816 2018-10-13 17:55:57 Good job @alroker - your cooking skills are awesome - what kind of tuna did you used? Jarred in oil or fresh? I like using the tuna oil to season the dressing.
9817 2018-10-13 17:55:57 We need a gov that will run and win on a mandate to produce and refine 150% as our national needs (as a minimum), displace the foreign oil and products coming in.
9818 2018-10-13 17:55:49 Yes ohhh, he wanted to use cheese in place of oil, cheese!!
9819 2018-10-13 17:55:42 this is really well put & commonly believed by most british colombians. we see the first hand effects and devastation of pipelines & say NO to pipelines! 

if you really want to keep canada being dependent on foreign markets then STOP SHIPPING OUR OIL OVERSEAS.

9822 2018-10-13 17:55:22 The big question is, how long will TMac and Chia last? Yes, the Oil drew a poor schedule to begin the year but there are few signs this team is any better than last year.  Tough to win with only one line.
9823 2018-10-13 17:55:19 And what exactly is the idea in the tweet? That Alberta is still heavily reliant on oil royalties and that the global price crash is becoming more permanent then Kenney thought it would be?
9824 2018-10-13 17:55:10 Drill for oil, if it affects home owners water, move people out of the area.

9826 2018-10-13 17:55:00 2 years? A contemplative moment I think perhaps closer 100yrs since WW1 Rise of the Bolsheviks Nazis & Fascists. Peace movements of 60's spreading subtle euphoria. Rise of prosperity built on debt, oil, cooperation. Now near the end of the cycle with discord. #Brexit is a symptom
9827 2018-10-13 17:54:55 “Data is the new oil”. But is it going to make you a better driver? Let data augment your quest to know your client and to delight them with service. Client #inclusion makes us intelligent and helps us build better client experiences. Be client obsessed. Data is just oil.
9828 2018-10-13 17:54:42 Why are you not using the RSPO logo on your packaging? You advertise that you source fish ethically do why not advertise this?  I’m losing faith. I wonder what Emma Thompson would say especially having just narrated a video about palm oil destruction.. 2/2
9829 2018-10-13 17:54:15 “I can get you out of here with $500 flat, what’s your budget” my budget is just the oil change lmao
9830 2018-10-13 17:54:13 More Olive Oil than Popeye? 
9831 2018-10-13 17:54:09 I honestly try not to add any fats to any meals that are not found naturally in "real" foods, themselves. I used to add a small amount of olive oil to greens but I don't even do that now. But then again, I don't eat greens now, so easier to do.
9832 2018-10-13 17:54:06 Why do people keep saying this.  Alberta has many other economic sectors, it's just that oil is huge.  In fact so huge that we distribute 20 billion a year to the rest of the country.  It could be more if we had pipelines.
9833 2018-10-13 17:54:02 Is there a specific coconut oil?
9834 2018-10-13 17:54:00 What's he gonna do, spank them? We need the oil.

9841 2018-10-13 17:52:40 And you do like oil then!  Wow, and you an educator!  Must have given your students a balanced perspective!
9842 2018-10-13 17:52:35 One day when oil is no more.
They can't drug people no more.
Then the happy days come.
Wondering what people did for 200 years.

9848 2018-10-13 17:51:44 Wow listening to Jack Michaels. He’s so annoying. Always talking about how Rangers have beat Oil last 5 times and how Cam has not won a game against him.
9849 2018-10-13 17:51:36 Gravy ring always. Called gravy ring as the oil used was called gravy
9850 2018-10-13 17:51:34 Yes, we're going to punish you by not buying your oil.  Yeah, that will really punish you.

9853 2018-10-13 17:51:12 Let those numbers sink in people! A record 100 Million barrels per day are being produced world wide and Alberta Oil is the culprit... really? C’mon folks this is madness! The solution isn’t taxes it’s pipelines!

9857 2018-10-13 17:50:41 My bad there are Dew brands in Japan but the ingredient Bromulated Vegetable Oil is banned in Japan and Europe but not in the US (linked to memory/skin/nerve problems if drink to excess). That's in addition to other health issues.
9858 2018-10-13 17:50:24 The plastic sign pictured with the message written with permanent markers would not be possible without oil......just sayin’......
9859 2018-10-13 17:50:20 Shouldn't bonds due for payment refelect reflect (righly so) debt servicing rather than a drop in revenue? 

I understand that oil prices were high in 11-13 but I'm particular about 16&17. Prices were higher in 17 than 16 & pipeline vandalization were more prevalent in 2016.
9860 2018-10-13 17:50:16 Please tell me who is more mad, I suggested using protein powder in place of milk for my pancake mix and @ohimaii_ suggested using cheese in place of oil to fry an omelette, again to fry an omelette...please who is more mad?

9863 2018-10-13 17:49:59 The Holy oil that Jesus took from the evil priests is: Virgin olive oil, cannabis buds, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. It was illegal for Jesus to give the Holy oil to the common man. He then exposed the rulers and priests as the blood of Cain and he was dead

9876 2018-10-13 17:48:54 Do you think we can make more money off of tar sands oil, when factoring in externalities like associated health, pollution and climate costs, than say exporting clean tech or renewables based electricity over the long term?

9885 2018-10-13 17:48:12 Castor oil and Aloe Vera spray are my best friends. Also learn about the porosity of your hair and then figure out, which products will work for you. I had to figure out my personalized routine that was best for my kinks and coils.

9888 2018-10-13 17:48:03 Dear Mechanics Who Did My Oil Change,

When I ask for an oil change, that usually means drain all the oil out of my car, change the filter, and then fill it up. Not change the filter and add in 1 qt of oil YOU [redacted].

This literally has been the worst week.
9889 2018-10-13 17:48:01 I see him running to the exit, but he does not see me... Oil is slick, but HE is NOT!!!!

9891 2018-10-13 17:47:48 Sitting waiting for mechanics to finish my oil change is the most anxious thing ever. I pray they don’t find anything wrong wit my car.
9892 2018-10-13 17:47:45 There is only so much macadamias avocado and good olive oil I can eat swapping some steak for wild caught salmon other than that I’m out of ideas.
9893 2018-10-13 17:47:39 My back problems are stemming from the oil that cake up in there
9894 2018-10-13 17:47:30 And we’re at peak oil, too.
9895 2018-10-13 17:47:26 Here’s a suggestion: calling people idiots doesn’t help them want to listen to you. If oil is too cheap it really doesn’t matter how many customers we have, it costs more to extract than we can get for it. That’s what this article is about.
9896 2018-10-13 17:47:22 I share the same concern! Unlike oil, NG is an open secret plus has no political risk premiums. I also think market cannot be that foolhardy. Got to therefore go with a simple thesis: extreme COT just a recipe for reversal. Of course, extreme is subjective, as some have pointed.
9897 2018-10-13 17:47:21 Not exactly, as it was a lucky bounce but I get what you are getting at.

9904 2018-10-13 17:46:00 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.

9906 2018-10-13 17:45:55 Wild growth oil + scalp massage = LOVE 
9907 2018-10-13 17:45:48 And where does this oil money come from? It doesn't start in Abu Dhabi. You need to take a look at the countries buying the oil and then maybe these moralistic view's would have some substance.
9908 2018-10-13 17:45:47 & the box be slippery  like tryna walk on oil.
9909 2018-10-13 17:45:40 I agree with how important this is. And admit I don’t know much about oil market.  But do know that the Saudis (older regime) has brought down oil prices for US (by flooding market) numerous times. Playing with fire.  How about cancelling arms sales? (Trump won’t) best option tho
9910 2018-10-13 17:45:27 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
9911 2018-10-13 17:45:02 Canadas own politicians have screwed Canadas oil industry just as much as any American politician has.

9913 2018-10-13 17:44:41 Maybe it’s the CBD oil, or maybe it’s just a good day. Either way I feel like I’m doing okay.
9914 2018-10-13 17:44:39 Hmm , yer majority is mariners , in towns with mariners - thats a shit argument really.

Everyone I know is anti nuclear , as for the jobs argument , removing trident means oil on the clyde , as well as gas - not a bill for the Scots for Trident it rejects instead.
9915 2018-10-13 17:44:29 Jobs have tumbled more than ever before these past three years. Banks, Oil companies, Mutual fund firms have all laid off. The economic situation in the country keeps tumbling. The stock market is as unstable as ever. And you give this government a pass mark. Do you live here?
9916 2018-10-13 17:44:26 Vitamin E oil is a blessing to my face, those scars heal up quick 
9917 2018-10-13 17:44:25 Then there is the more easily-seen:8yrs. of FL revoking environmental protections & unrestricted building (wait-time  to almost zero)contibuting to deadliest red tide/algae blooms in history.Add in  oil drilling,no govt. funding for green energy & that "beautiful coal".

9971 2018-10-13 17:38:29 Having the same problem with one of my dads old cars. He keep putting off selling it saying there’s a oil leak or it’s has a rough idle, alway something. I’ll let him think he’s fooling us, he’s 86 let him have fun.
9972 2018-10-13 17:38:25 I support the pipeline. The east coast imports oil from Saudi Arabia so just think about that next time you fill up. If it wasnt for the oil sands you couldn't keep the lights on in your schools and hospitals, send back those equalization payments if you dont like it.

9974 2018-10-13 17:38:19 A lot of people don't appreciate that software engineering done right requires expertise, and unfortunately, there is a lot of snake oil in the industry.

9978 2018-10-13 17:37:57 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
9979 2018-10-13 17:37:34 The more articles like this you put out, the more I’m going to do to FIGHT the Earth! Burn more oil and gas! Use more electricity and water! Waste more paper and use more PLASTIC! The EARTH MUST SUBMIT!
9980 2018-10-13 17:37:34 A US general just made a statement that we must prevent Syria from regaining control of their oil, because it would allow them to rebuild their infrastructure. Ya know, because the humanitarian thing to do is deny Syrians clean water, safe roads, and electricity. 
9981 2018-10-13 17:37:32 INCREASE IS OIL PRODUCTION NOW!
FLOOD THE MARKET DRIVE PRICE DOWN.

9982 2018-10-13 17:37:27 Palm oil is in so many products, but there are alternatives available.  It's hard, but boycott palm oil.  Write the corporations and tell them you will no longer purchase their products until palm oil is gone from their list of ingredients.

9987 2018-10-13 17:36:36 There is a panic because of the climate and it’s terrifying and depressing and the fact some people want to say it’s ‘because you’re not vegan’ and not primarily blaming oil and corporations and their fuckery irritates me
9988 2018-10-13 17:36:06 dad asked if he could put some of my lavender oil in his bath but ‘not too much, I don’t want to smell like a puff’s handbag’ ... so anyway i emptied at least half in
9989 2018-10-13 17:36:05 Doubt it, except that it’s the oil that gives them $$$ to bribe Trump and Kushner.

9992 2018-10-13 17:35:51 Their answer will be that it comes from the government...

I find it amazing how many people on the left will actually claim that Oil and Gas is subsidized by the government. No joke.

However, 2014-2015 revenue drop, pipline vandalization, oil was @$34/a barrel.  2016/17.We have bonds that are due paid off

10005 2018-10-13 17:34:15 Try using olive oil or the pam olive oil spray for a better taste
10006 2018-10-13 17:34:11 I love my vape pen..the oil is mostly thc. much better pain relief than smoking a joint. But then I used a pen years ago and it was great help.
10007 2018-10-13 17:34:09 I hope ole dude change my oil no charge 
10008 2018-10-13 17:34:06 I once had someone tell me that a particular essential oil removed germs from a room & kept people from being sick.
10009 2018-10-13 17:34:06 I used coconut oil as conditioner and I think I used too much so now I have to take another shower before work. And I got water in my phone. Today is canceled
10010 2018-10-13 17:34:06 "walk every morning with a retired oil man and a retired guy in the battery business, 'Trump Republicans.' Contrary to what you and the polls are saying, I see these guys tiring of Trump and his lies. In fact they are most sick of government at large"

10013 2018-10-13 17:33:58 I spent significant time on several Florida beaches this year. I hope whoever replaces Rick Scott actually gives a damn about the worst water quality since the Gulf oil disaster.
10014 2018-10-13 17:33:54 i need suggestions for moisturiser! My skin type is combination. Baru tau kulit aku allergic to mineral oil huhu
10015 2018-10-13 17:33:50 I needed to call Metro Honda to cancel an oil change, so I look it up & type in “Metro”. A girl answers & asked what I needed help with. So I tell her what’s up and she fucking says  “Umm this is Metro PCS” 

..... I’m a damn fool 
10016 2018-10-13 17:33:49 Nice to see Nuge get on the board
10017 2018-10-13 17:33:45 We been sending our garbage for year to China instead of dealing with it. Fighting the local oil industry and buying offshore, as long the pollution dont append in Canada its ok I guess? Stoping over packaging, education and better management of our resource that's what we need.
10018 2018-10-13 17:33:44 No baby oil bro just some lotion
