You're just getting started with what... selling this snake oil? Because you started that a while ago.
5 2018-08-01 23:59:39 Yes, our hands have been completely tied by the backdoor funding by US to landlock our oil. And don’t forget the enviro-nuts who have bought into it, hook line and sinker. Fucking stupid since those other countries have few enviro standards.

Was trying to get Germany to dump buying Russian oil in favor of US oil Putins doing? Putin is against those policies
13 2018-08-01 23:58:00 The opening scene is classic. The oil guy is giving the presentation abt their acquisition of Scotland but then corrects himself & says “a piece of Scotland” as if it’s a key distinction. Lol. It’s my fav movie of all time & my absolute fav type of humor. The cast is brilliant.
14 2018-08-01 23:57:52 You nailed Uptown Whittier perfectly. If you want to see a stark contrast just check out South Whittier where you’ll find the newly immigrant homes and store front aplenty. The oil refinery hasn’t moved nor has its working class neighbors.

In order to combat oily skin, use moisturizer(water-based) or any hydrating products on your face. Ang excessive washing para mawala ang oil sa face is a big NO NO NO.
41 2018-08-01 23:56:24 I capitalize on the waste. It helps replenish the midnight oil that I burn for my work. I do better because my time on Twitter. I have stats to prove it!

43 2018-08-01 23:55:47 I get annoyed when people say mental health issues can be "cured" by running or some weird essential oil. Sorry my depression and anxiety annoys you, let me just stick some ice cream in my shoes. That outta get rid of it.

57 2018-08-01 23:53:28 A White House suggestion to hit $200 billion in Chinese imports with a 25% tariff accelerated a stronger dollar inspired commodity sell down. Bonds sold off, the US dollar rose and shares came under pressure. Gold hit a 12 month low. Copper and oil slumped @MicMcCarthy_CMC

59 2018-08-01 23:52:50 Well, they're not going to take Big Oil offline by preaching into megaphones or dangling off of bridges. They  need to get off their granola-munching, hemp-smoking arses and invent us a battery or ultracapacitor for prime-mover power storage and green-grid power buffering.

64 2018-08-01 23:51:42 @smartereveryday  One of the things I saw was if you had to cups of oil and put annode and cathode in each cup and moved them close together the oil kinda siphoned from one cup to the other. Would really love to hear about the physics behind from my favorite physics communicator.
65 2018-08-01 23:51:30 @smartereveryday Hey Destin, I saw this weird phenomenon where you put high voltage in oil and it behaves really weird. Maybe you could do a video explaining the physics behind it? More in next tweet...
66 2018-08-01 23:51:23 It was  Mustard oil that used a candlestick to break the tube of lipstick
67 2018-08-01 23:51:15 You say: Fossil Fuel.

68 2018-08-01 23:51:13 The end is before you, so get the oil for your lamp before the Lord comes knocking at your door. So be it! So be it! So be it!
69 2018-08-01 23:50:07 Never, I tend not to watch as I honestly think I have a jinx but I will ALWAYS love the Oil!!!!!
70 2018-08-01 23:50:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
71 2018-08-01 23:50:01 Yes all the tripe about catch tanks and standing bikes on mats in the pit so oil doesn't get into the envirionment then there is a patch of it on the track what was going on?
72 2018-08-01 23:49:59 u ever just smell and smell and it makes you nervous? patchouli oil makes me so flipping anxious ugh
73 2018-08-01 23:49:42 i like the vinegar ones more than the creamy ones. rice wine vinegar and sesame oil with scallions carrots 
74 2018-08-01 23:49:26 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
75 2018-08-01 23:49:23 If you want to waste over 1.5 hrs getting your oil changed, then go to @Walmart on 67th st. I arrived at 5:06, car was finished at 5:19, but they never came in to the waiting area until I mentioned I was there for 1.5 hrs. 
76 2018-08-01 23:48:52 Came in at 6 AM yowling, "Mama, mama!!!" All covered with oil and dirt and hungry and thirsty, but she was OK. I'm so happy you found her! The little heart attacks!  2/2

81 2018-08-01 23:47:58 I guess you don't realize the major oil traffic that flows through, that keep the world moving. The point is why is this news?

86 2018-08-01 23:46:28 Who we fighting?  Let Russia blow all their money in Syria and we should stop using oil.
87 2018-08-01 23:46:23 Yes of course, and I know all about oil spills much more than you could possibly comprehend.  For an FYI, my friend who Anand reminds me of... Testified at the Deepwater Horizon Hearing in Congress.  He was the ASB safety inspector who failed them on each inspection.
88 2018-08-01 23:46:22 If this was the 1800s, Donald Trump would be the type of conman to sell people snake oil, and this woman would be the type of sucker to buy it.
89 2018-08-01 23:46:20 You know, sometimes I look at olives and think what crazy Greek guy/gal decided

 "Hey let's eat these little green things that we use to make oil."

Because olives are disgusting and I don't know how anyone can enjoy them.

98 2018-08-01 23:45:17 Lo que ustedes no saben, es que en Italia prefieren aprender latín, antes de aprender inglés.

En Francia, se enseña oil, pero no inglés.

Es más, en Venezuela es obligatorio hablar warao, pero no inglés ni francés.

Somos nosotros esos pinches racistas.
99 2018-08-01 23:45:15 And Jason is making all those oil and gas jobs come back how exactly ?
100 2018-08-01 23:44:59 You lost an election and lost what was left of your mind.  How is making world’s #1 oil & natural gas provider supporting Russia?  How is building up  military supporting Russia?  Hint - none of it does!  Take your meds, Nurse Debby. Your cat loves you, though.
101 2018-08-01 23:44:47 Coconut oil has done wonders as fading my surgery scars! But I also used sea butter lotions and palmers skin therapy!

107 2018-08-01 23:43:30 Maybe tell your Supreme Leader to pay his debts.  He stiffed hundreds of contractors over the years.  The “King of Debt” is nothing but a snake oil salesman.
108 2018-08-01 23:43:21 Says the guy who doesn't understand the positive externalities of a better relationship with Russia. There's this guy called Obama who funded ISIS to stop an oil pipeline to Syria, and tried to ouster the government of Ukraine to stop another pipeline.
109 2018-08-01 23:43:16 I stay rubbing myself with oil. I’m trying eucalyptus for the first time
110 2018-08-01 23:43:06 I will say it again there is not a bigger Snake Oil salesman in all of college football then #UrbanMeyer the guy was a slime ball at Florida & let the inmates run the asylum now he has done it again at #OhioState this time though it bit him in the ass
111 2018-08-01 23:42:47 Freshman STAY AWAY from the Nupe Juice and the Que Oil
112 2018-08-01 23:42:35 I tried it. In my case it was lemon juice and olive oil. Personally I think the oil bonds with the lemon juice and makes what appears to be stones. Didn’t work. Long story short, today I have no gallbladder.
113 2018-08-01 23:42:22 Elon Musk up against the whole oil and gas industry man. Shit crazy. Imagine the strings they’re pulling to hinder this Tesla wave
114 2018-08-01 23:42:21 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
115 2018-08-01 23:42:19 @RichardJanes Welcome to #OKC 
We may not be perfect in every possible way but who/where is?
Don’t forget to explore all of Oklahoma. Tulsa has a rich heritage; Eastern & Southern parts have beautiful terrain & scenery. Western & Northern OK are big farms, oil, & friendly waves.
116 2018-08-01 23:42:16 Why don’t you fly yourself down to Odessa TX and meet me in Midland at “The Bar” a very nice establishment. I’ll introduce you to some of my oil field friends and we’ll show you how we treat “#AssClown’s” in Texas. P.S. Bring your sac lunch, you’ll need it
117 2018-08-01 23:42:12 False. It is the pretzels. Also, make sure to use all three types of #chex and bake thoroughly.  Also, sub in peanut oil.

119 2018-08-01 23:41:54 i just use cetaphil as a face cleanser, a deep clean exfoliating scrub, and then a toner? i think it’s called, just to get whatever i may have missed from the face wash... if you have dry skin you can probably incorporate a moisturizer or face oil but i haven’t tried that yet
120 2018-08-01 23:41:44 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
121 2018-08-01 23:41:42 Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia all compete for Chinese oil marketshare. They try to undermine each other.
122 2018-08-01 23:41:39 In days gone by it would have been New Zealand vying for that position - but now it appears we don't have enough guts to even do what is necessary on oil exploration.
123 2018-08-01 23:41:38 She obviously goes for the snake oil salesman type! Sssssssilly girl!
124 2018-08-01 23:41:19 Did you not go to the woman’s march????

129 2018-08-01 23:40:39 You say you don't want Colorado to turn into Cali. If this P.O.S becomes governor, more oil drilling and POLLUTION will happen. Thus creating smog, just like Cali. This state needs to stay CLEAN and Beautiful. That will NOT happen if he's governor.

But, heaven forbid, those disadvantaged, poor people get a ‘free’ handout - basic income. The hypocrisy is mind-boggling - skewed priorities! #onpoli #cdnpoli

142 2018-08-01 23:39:30 Their program actually does meet the standards as did Ontario's when it was in place..The cap & trade is executed differently but gets to the same end goal. And no, that's not what happened today, the plan alwaya included sector subsidy and really NO? oil and gas are not excluded

148 2018-08-01 23:38:22 I keep our house at a constant 24c and in the winter around 22c. Easy on the thermopompe as we say here. And minimizes the electricity/ oil bill.
149 2018-08-01 23:38:18 Ew. I had them in one of the training rooms in work- I hoovered them up then used a cleaning fluid with orange oil, it's supposed to repel them. Seemed to work, but I can't guarantee it.

Hope your new apartment is treating you well, apart from manky silverfish.

151 2018-08-01 23:37:58 Buy at dollar general they have a no check ID law due to liking money more than having to check ID,  buy more ramen.  Then you will die slower and ruin the planet faster due to palm oil use.  Oh and while you are their ask them for potting soil so you can grow some food in a pot
152 2018-08-01 23:37:56 All your propaganda infomercials and ego boosting rallies are a glaring sign of a snake oil salesman. It’s who and what you are. The rest is all smoke and mirrors. The smell of desperation is getting a bit thick, but tweet on Donnie boy...

Not going back soon
177 2018-08-01 23:33:37 Someone please explain to me how the oil industry became the only industry to sell a product down to a tenth of a cent.  $3.33 and 9/10ths you say?  ... really tho?
178 2018-08-01 23:33:35 I bought the same coconut flakes cereal from Thrive Market and got excruciating stomach pains every time I ate it.

184 2018-08-01 23:32:37 So they pour oil on the track when nobody was going to be on it? Unless someone was practicing? If the rules say in no circumstances can you pour oil on the track, then fine. But does it actually say that? Or is it just discouraged?
185 2018-08-01 23:32:32 if you dont already have it, get CBD oil for the inflammation, vitamin E and aloe (pure) it helps heal. I have heard medicinal honey too, with turmeric. make a paste. Same group of virus causes herpatic lesions, honey and turmeric helps.

189 2018-08-01 23:31:10 Oil & gas, pulp& paper still have to meet the original standards, nothing changed for them. The only sectors that had their standards relaxed were those based primarily in ont and Quebec, steel, aluminum, concrete etc.

204 2018-08-01 23:26:36 My understanding is that Quebec’s cap& trade equates to $18 ton, not equitable to what the rest of us pay. Today’s relaxing of the rules favors sectors based in Quebec and ont.,oil & gas, pulp&paper , western based sectors excluded and you wonder why we want to have our own plan

215 2018-08-01 23:24:53 Sorry mate I don’t mean to have a go at u I am just saying that our first turn has always been bumpy because the shale does not bind and I’m just saying that the oil helps it bind according to the track grader
216 2018-08-01 23:24:38 There is still  0.5TCF and a whole lot of oil in the ground which is only increasing in value with the O&G prices. All it takes is a little capital to get it flowing out the ground. Patience. #AST
217 2018-08-01 23:24:36 Yes, the floating trash bag/oil slick monster cracked me up. 
I didn’t know there was a 3.
218 2018-08-01 23:24:33 Well poole did, after the meeting I must add, but using oil to bind the track is against the rules and has been for a few years now, so Robert has the right to point this out like this
219 2018-08-01 23:24:31 I’m ready to start my new job making that oil field mula 
220 2018-08-01 23:24:25 Tax payer funded rallies, taxpayer funded golf, tax payer funded friendly meetings with Putin and Kim Jong Un and rants about the collusion you were involved in. The Trump agenda. Biggest seller of snake oil in the USA.
221 2018-08-01 23:24:16 My brother wants me to add some "oil" to it to make it shiny.  Asshole doesnt seem to know that my skin is oily as hell.  I sure as hell won't add more fucking oil to my greasy-ass face.  I'm not the middle east.  Fuck that.
222 2018-08-01 23:24:07 If read correctly, he makes his point very clear anyway. He mentions how the rider's have rules to abide by, and they come along and deliberately pour oil on the track! The was the point he made and that was also an account of what happened.
223 2018-08-01 23:24:06 changed the oil in my car ALL BY MYSELF. straight mode activated!

229 2018-08-01 23:22:57 I'm an environmentalist.

I want to see practical renewable energy.

But I am also a realist.
Until renewable energy is practical, cutting fossil fuels increases how much we spend at the tank.
Protesters of oil production often protest with their ideals and not their gas mileage.
230 2018-08-01 23:22:38 When I was in Gambia the roads were littered with brand new trucks provided by the EU and other countries. No matter what you said or did you could not make them put oil or water in them so within 3 or 4 months they had been destroyed. Shortly after they were stripped bare.

233 2018-08-01 23:22:14 "coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989
During the preceding decade, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon and Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions"
234 2018-08-01 23:22:08 Well I am it cost us riders money and also if the bikes did drop the oil out it would help the tracks.
235 2018-08-01 23:22:02 Acrylic painting didn’t go as expected at all! Think my aunt wasted $ & paint. Back to oil I’m thinking , but not quitting just yet. Not that smart & way too stubborn! #Life
236 2018-08-01 23:21:53 CLIMATE LEADERS DON'T BUILD PIPELINES. we've gone from aiming for climate leadership, to aiming for whatever the oil industry tells our government to aim for. politicians have sold us out for a sunset #tarsands industry which wouldn't even exist without their massive subsidies
237 2018-08-01 23:21:49 As I said before, if the original tweet was clarified a little, then most reasonable Poole fans would back off. To be fair his tweet saying (if oil is good to bind the track) why not let the bikes drip onto the track was actually a damn good point.
238 2018-08-01 23:21:45 Correct! My upline was horrid. All she cared about was making money. I have $900 worth of oil sitting in a box that I’m too afraid to use

249 2018-08-01 23:20:03 "The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet. And every year, by burning coal, oil and gas, humankind belched increasingly obscene quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere"
250 2018-08-01 23:20:01 Also in the rule book it states that oil is not allowed to be use on tracks due to environmental reasons, so Robert has all right to be bringing this up 2/2
251 2018-08-01 23:19:59 President Trump has Putin's attention from vibrations felt dropping mother of all bombs in Afghanistan, He destroys ISIS Caliphate, Destroys Syrian airport and jets, kills Russian mercenaries, steals Russia's Global Oil business, strengthens NATO, Ukraine, Saudi Group & sanctions
252 2018-08-01 23:19:56 Yes, it was "capitalist sabotage" that mismanaged Venezuela's oil reserves, ousted farmers from their land (which now sits idle, not producing food) and started printing money like a Kinkos.  Are you really that deluded?

277 2018-08-01 23:16:10 Not really, that's propaganda. I'd like to see more conservative response to Israel and Palestine problems. Atrocities are being committed and no response from the UK... if there was oil, we'd be the first there

284 2018-08-01 23:14:50 Well you purchase the peppermint oil and apply it directly where there is pain ... it will ease the tension / inflammation. And it’s amazing for headaches and back - shoulder pain . You can use it for many things VERY AFFECTIVE
285 2018-08-01 23:14:38 The pride they have in their own ignorance is truly astounding.

Trump's #Deplorables fully embraces vitriolic bigotry, unfettered greed, callous disregard for their fellow man, and unwavering loyalty to an avowed egocentric snake oil salesman. #Cult45 #TrumpsAmerica
286 2018-08-01 23:14:38 @matthewmercer if you have any free time at GenCon it'd be awesome if you could check out my brother's tabletop game, Dusk: Arena of Shadows (Purple 19, Lucas Oil Field). First time he's working it at a big con!

293 2018-08-01 23:13:21 you know you’ve been cooking for a long time when hot oil pops on you and you don’t even flinch
294 2018-08-01 23:13:13 About an hour. It was torture after 5 minutes.  Fishing and ADD/ADHD is like water and oil: They don't mix well. 
295 2018-08-01 23:12:55 Maybe he’s just so delighted to oil up?
296 2018-08-01 23:12:48 @TYTLive Not 2 mention much of Middle-East post WW2 turmoil beyond Israel was in large part a consequence of democratically elected Head of then very western Iran-having had the temerity 2 want 2 nationalize Iran's oil- b overthrown by Chevron/BP 2B replaced by brutal tyrant Shah

304 2018-08-01 23:11:22 Canada is quite happy to bring in Saudi oil when a simple pipeline reversal could have brought Canadian oil east. Hypocritical mayor of Mtl cried enviro concerns but dumps raw sewage. Pathetic! We deserve the end we're going to see
305 2018-08-01 23:11:20 In the valley and In dire need of some oil carts. Point me in the right direction, Twitter.
306 2018-08-01 23:11:18 Jamaican black castor oil, you can get it from the beauty supply and use it twice a a day, but not a lot a little goes a long way with that stuff
307 2018-08-01 23:11:12 To import crude oil from the neighboring Niger Republic. Not crude oil from Niger Delta. Private investment.

311 2018-08-01 23:11:01 Hell of a spot for an oil filter
312 2018-08-01 23:10:54 That's now considered a career choice?
313 2018-08-01 23:10:45 Steve Scalise gave a speech at EURO, a group founded by Klansman David Duke.  That’s why some of these folks are called Nazis. Did he deserve to be shot? Of course not. But he’s a racist, anti-gay bigot and should be chastised for it. He is no hero.
314 2018-08-01 23:10:45 I just never went to fairs.  I grew up in the oil field, Cindy. If we went to fairs...Most of the time I didn't get food stuff. I didn't think about it. It was normal.
315 2018-08-01 23:10:40 Gotta get my oil changed

321 2018-08-01 23:10:00 Still searching.  It certainly would be one that would disclose their financial dealings. It would be one that was about states rights. Not owned by oil/gas  or banks. Honestly, Palin isn’t looking so bad now after this shit show. But still way less than optimal.
322 2018-08-01 23:09:59 Yo my back has been killing me for dayyyysssss I really need to invest in some CBD oil.
323 2018-08-01 23:09:41 These two snake oil salesmen both work for the Harper reform movement controlled by the crackpots at the USA WH.  When they say "for the people" they mean democracy is too expensive for their corporate sponsors.

325 2018-08-01 23:08:57 Dubai was a desert 50 years ago, about same time we also found oil. Dubai is most green 2day, while we're turning to a desert, economically
326 2018-08-01 23:08:54 Not to mention, even his RSO recipe is Full Extract Cannabis Oil. Meaning, it contains CBD, terpenes, and other cannabinoids....so how does he really know what in it is doing the killing?

334 2018-08-01 23:07:43 Lambert was probably too busy going on holiday and missing the test match cos he's tired to wait and see what really happened. 
Plus oil used to be used to bind the shale no drops now and shale isn't binding so mixing oil with shale after racing wouldn't be a shock.
335 2018-08-01 23:07:38 I am a rich Texas oil man, and I'll be dagblasted if my favor-ite live showing of any radioshow ain't Checkpoint Radio. I am selling my juxtillion shares of Comcast TODAY!

340 2018-08-01 23:06:58 Technology and innovation don't stay static. We have oil for 100's of years. We have a abundance of rare earth metals and technology will only help us discover and recover more in the future just like it has with oil, these are all recyclable. New technology will be the solution.
341 2018-08-01 23:06:57 Hey I didn't know you own Mystic Man. I bought beard oil for my brother for Eid.

343 2018-08-01 23:06:48 Aside for retro rockets, can you add some machine guns and oil/spike discharge ports to integrate better with the games? Consider adding laser canons as bonus level unlocks. ;)
344 2018-08-01 23:06:46 Too easy.

And we invaded Iraq for their oil
And Jews control the weather. And the government. And Hollywood.
345 2018-08-01 23:06:42 Bio oil
346 2018-08-01 23:06:37 Why don’t we scrap the plans for the oil pipelines and use them to move all the flood water and rainwater from the east coast and areas impacted by hurricanes. It makes no sense to have one area underwater while another part of the country is afflicted with drought.
347 2018-08-01 23:06:35 Quickly Sear the meat ultra rare on high in a frying pan just salt and pepper and a little olive oil. Then cut it into little medallions, put em in a casserole pan. Then De-glaze your pan with a healthy amount of red wine, add a couple ladle-fulls of tomato sauce....(contd)

351 2018-08-01 23:06:22 This will forever be one of my all-time favorite finishes. I don’t care it there was oil all over the track. Instant classic.

353 2018-08-01 23:05:56 Musk is also taking a stab at the oil industry via Tesla which is literally and figuratively the worst business on Earth
354 2018-08-01 23:05:50 I legit opened the hood of my car (like I would actually fucking know something) and all I did was stare at the battery and then check my oil. Closed the hood and stomped inside. #useless #sorryimawoman
355 2018-08-01 23:05:25 the ones from steers are defs a last resort. The smell of the oil makes me gag and they’re lowkey fried mashed potatoes
356 2018-08-01 23:05:22 Yeah I get that but it’s against the rules. If I didn’t have my mats and oil catchers I would get a fine so why shouldn’t the club ?
357 2018-08-01 23:05:21 I see there's  no relief for Alberta oil!!!
358 2018-08-01 23:05:14 It wasn’t long after the meeting finished! Like I said I’m only saying what I saw, but basically where the tractor comes out, a guy walked onto the track with a bottle of oil and poured it onto the track towards the first bend, no expert on tracks so thought nothing of it 
359 2018-08-01 23:05:13 you gotta stay tuned for the next time they call me out of work 
360 2018-08-01 23:05:11 So Sen Matthew James Canavan came down here to South Australia from Rockhampton this week to sell us two entirely inappropriate nuclear dump sites and big Norge oil drillers loose amongst the whales and breeding fish in the Great Australian Bight.

362 2018-08-01 23:04:53 I wonder if those protesters are aware of the fact that just over the horizon to the west of that beach, oil tankers 1.5 times the size of those associated with TMX have been sailing from AK to WA at a rate of about 1 per day for 3 decades.

377 2018-08-01 23:02:24 @Scottymechanic Hello Scotty! Question: All parameters being the same, I don't understand why I get 60 miles more per tank using Exxon/Mobil 87 octane gas while getting 60 miles per tank using Shell 87 octane gas. Same routes, I even changed oil last week 100% Synthetic Castrol.
378 2018-08-01 23:01:49 You've made a valid point Robert. The oil trick was used in the past to bind the shale. Not supposed to happen anymore as you know.
379 2018-08-01 23:01:48 That is a little TRAJECTORY, a little movement of some of that oil slick, that oil that's moving in here.

390 2018-08-01 23:00:14 (Cont'd) Does it mean the trilateral deal will create many more oil rigs on sea? Also Aussie Foreign Minister said, 'unsustainable debt isn't imposed on recipient nations'. So who bear the final cost -- ordinary Aussies, people of USA or Japan? And which nation is true recipient?

392 2018-08-01 23:00:09 At what point did this happen as I left to the glass grandstand just seconds before the press conference and there wasn’t anyone pouring oil on the track then!

394 2018-08-01 22:59:54 Feeling amazing this evening. I had some fall outs today at work...didn’t get calls back from who I needed to. But got off work early. Hit the gym for over an hour. I’m usually tired by now but I’m wide awake. Ketosis day 6. Amazing. The MCT oil is a real boost.

399 2018-08-01 22:59:07 OH GOD yeah i wanted to try a charcoal mask but also didn’t want it to destroy my sensitive skin so i did some googling ahead of time! i have oil and moisturizer ready to go for afterwards
400 2018-08-01 22:58:59 My nails are a wreck from doing oil changes but the guys refuse to buy me gloves

403 2018-08-01 22:58:47 Hey, guess what... Oil is needed. Now, tomorrow, and for the next 80 years. Maybe by 100 years from now, we can see it being only lightly used, but right now it keeps 8 billion people alive.
404 2018-08-01 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
405 2018-08-01 22:58:27 I drink aloottt of water and use noxema and coconut oil on my face  and thank you
406 2018-08-01 22:58:20 Just like everywhere else it's not about ceasing fossil fuel extraction, but rather it's about generating consent for the next phase of fossil fuel destruction. Remember the Moomba Carbon Storage Project? It was actually about enhanced oil recovery.
407 2018-08-01 22:58:13 Personally wouldn't give a thank you for anything Lambert said nor would I waste a penny to watch him  - shouldn't he be on holiday as he's too tired for the test match??
As for the oil the oil used to bind the shale but no drips now & shale isn't binding anywhere. May explain it
408 2018-08-01 22:58:13 If oil companies (fracking, pipelines) are willing to risk polluting aquifers and poisoning our life giving waters for PROFITS, then should an accident occur, can we execute the heads of the companies? and those making the greatest profits? 

Just asking.

418 2018-08-01 22:56:01 @ZacharyLevi hi Mr. Levi, do you have a particular brand of CBD oil that you like best?
419 2018-08-01 22:56:00 This was after the meeting from one of the tractors.....There was no oil on the track at anytime during the meeting .
420 2018-08-01 22:55:44 it's not different enough from sun tan oil for me to be convinced i should be drinking it
421 2018-08-01 22:55:29 Let me simmer in depths of oil. Deep fry. Becoming one with all forms of crisp.
422 2018-08-01 22:54:40 The consumer should not buy oil products.  They are the problem
423 2018-08-01 22:54:34 Call them what they are. Rich, very rich "Snake Oil Salesman".
424 2018-08-01 22:54:31 What is your favorite oil?
425 2018-08-01 22:54:25 rub a little but of peppermint oil on your temples 
426 2018-08-01 22:54:08 So essentially, screw Alberta, screw oil and gas, and screw individuals and small businesses, but we’ll give our corporate friends a break who pony up votes for us in eastern Canada.
427 2018-08-01 22:54:03 Well said!
428 2018-08-01 22:53:58 Then you'll always be part of the problem..if you can never compromise or understand your way is not the only way, or see the need for a graded approach you will always be as much a problem as the people who think all oil should be pulled out of the ground without any regulation
429 2018-08-01 22:53:47 I think they fancy themselves as actually superior to the rest of us. Not kidding.

431 2018-08-01 22:53:41 The Steele Dossier verified on many points. NOT DISPROVED ON ANY. Dossier correct that Putin sold 20% Rosneft Oil Co (to bribe Lyin' Donald). Carter Page despite previous denials, admitted to Congress he met Rosneft in Moscow. Dossier timescale fits Trump tower meetings.
432 2018-08-01 22:53:24 Breakdown of Today;

- Got shouted at by a Scouse Lady.
- Got shouted at by a Brummy Family.
- Got shouted at by a Welsh Family.
- Got an Oil burn from a Fryer.
- And to top it all off, picked up Human Shit off the floor. 

Today was a good Day.
433 2018-08-01 22:53:19 And if it wasn't for oil? What then?
434 2018-08-01 22:52:54 Guess it will all come out in the wash. Oh wait, you delusional MAGAts won't believe it unless it comes out of that lying snake oil salesman's big mouth. Sheeple can't think for themselves.

"Tatanggalin ko ang mga walang kwentas batas tulad ng oil price hike! Dahil ang oil price hike nakakataas ng mga bilihin"

Uhm..... economics.... girl.

And it's just 6am.
444 2018-08-01 22:51:03 Honorable mention about Athena: born from a fucking headache (Tylenol whomst????) And has a city named after her bc she sunned her uncle. Also a heavy user of olive oil (skin care queen)  
445 2018-08-01 22:50:56 today i found out that our dog loves the taste of coconut oil which is great cuz it's super good for em
446 2018-08-01 22:50:48 With inflation set to reach a MILLION (%) - 
Maduro is merely attempting to forestall the inevitable, by claiming he's discovered some miraculous (but undisclosed) method to reinvigorate his rapidly failing oil industry.
447 2018-08-01 22:50:44 Or, they can now buy snake oil plans.
448 2018-08-01 22:50:28 Gotta really market my oil to men  I be forgettin y’all be havin edges problems too
449 2018-08-01 22:50:24 My favorite is the lady who told me (in all seriousness) to bathe in olive oil.
450 2018-08-01 22:50:23 What's a good nighttime moisturizer or face oil?
451 2018-08-01 22:49:58 Looks like Brady has caught that oil on fire 
452 2018-08-01 22:49:56 It's fun! It's a very patient medium since the paint dries a lot slower. You can build up layers over a few days and apply glazes. Only negative for me is that the paint is more expensive than acrylic and there are so many oil mediums and solvents. I just use refined linseed oil.
453 2018-08-01 22:49:34 the clindamycin toner + spot remover i use if im having breakouts, the pha cream i dont use everyday but i use it for improving skin texture :) then i either use the serum(vb)+essence together or the rosehip oil lang (when my face is red). also, laneige makes u plump af!
454 2018-08-01 22:49:24 Thank you barrack Hussein for shutting down oil and gas industry in nm. Thanks for shutting down our power plants as well . You put people out of work and ruined the nm economy. I’m sure Iran is also thankful for the billions you sent them! How could you dislike America so much
455 2018-08-01 22:49:24 CBD oil affects my mental state.
456 2018-08-01 22:49:16 Guess who just bought Zinc and Fish Oil supplements
457 2018-08-01 22:49:13 There may well be genuine reasons for it but people are misrepresenting what Lambert stated and in some cases suggesting he's lied. It appears it was a deliberate act and you can see where Lambert is coming from when citing they have to have oil catchers/mats then this happens.

464 2018-08-01 22:47:43 i read it as bye but oil made me laugh thanks
465 2018-08-01 22:47:35 No, the people of this country have and seen that they have been sold snake oil. They are turning against brexit and those that lied to them. They are going to get very angry and want their pound of flesh.
466 2018-08-01 22:47:35 Data isn’t always oil. Mostly it’s nuclear waste that is horribly expensive to keep and when it leaks kills you.
467 2018-08-01 22:47:34 One of my homies about to switch lanes to oil and gas armed robber's  salary and he is hasn't slept since he got the offer. Go ball stupid. 
468 2018-08-01 22:47:25 I have 3 scentsy warmers. The wax is too damn expensive. I use essential oil diffusers now. My favorite blend is thieves. Soo good.
469 2018-08-01 22:47:22 Maybe if you stop consuming oil products they will produce less. Pretty sure you gas up your car and never think twice about it.

Not sure what to expect though
472 2018-08-01 22:47:06 So many people in lately that are afraid of western meds. Buying CBD oil. Not all CBD is the same.
473 2018-08-01 22:47:01 Don't disagree about being accountable, but is he just selling snake oil, and he isn't being upfront about his agenda, or is he simply out of his depth in this job?
474 2018-08-01 22:46:57 Morrison did You and #Cormann know about half billion to #GBR oil & gas execs? Did #AlanJoyce give $20k of free flights pa? WHY, WHO KNEW. 
Full Investigation for #corruption must happen.
475 2018-08-01 22:46:51 This is exactly what I predict also. Look at the oil markets. We will see a zig zag between oil and GDP which will go down. Booms and busts between oil prices and economic growth/collapse.
476 2018-08-01 22:46:40 @MikeLupica Trump has always told tall tales but when it is necessary he ups the lies + hyperbole but stays true to the SNAKE OIL SALESMAN that he is.
477 2018-08-01 22:46:18 Haven’t driven my car in about two weeks, finding all these surprises in it, like how I need an oil change and it’s making noises when I turn on my ac this is great!
478 2018-08-01 22:45:56 Clever? Maybe. But quite uneducated as to the business side of cycling. I mean, of course this is Dan’s perspective, he’s paid by an oil sheikh.
479 2018-08-01 22:45:54 Interest rates continue to climb boldly already hiking 7 times in 3 years! Gas prices climbing higher each day when a barrel of crude oil is around 67$. Wasn't  much more 20 years ago, gas was 1.20$ Been to the grocery store lately, notice a few items are100$ 6://usat.ly/2KjEWzI

487 2018-08-01 22:45:08 you know that sickening feeling you get when you fill your tank with gas? ten times worse when you get a $100 oil change
488 2018-08-01 22:45:04 (Cont'd) Does it mean the trilateral deal will create many more oil rigs on sea? Also Aussie Foreign Minister said, 'unsustainable debt isn't imposed on recipient nations'. So who bear the final cost -- ordinary Aussies, people of USA or Japan? And which nation is true recipient?

497 2018-08-01 22:43:28 Two ways to make watching #NASCAR road course racing tolerable:
1. Add rain
2. Add oil.

•use a t shirt or soft towel to wrap up your hair 
other tips
•wait at least 20 minutes to use a brush on your hair 
•put some coconut oil on the bottom of your ends to make them soft
499 2018-08-01 22:43:19 I’ve got crab fried rice, drunken noodles, hbo prime, Hulu prime, netflix, fortnite, and a couple grams of hash oil in my room right now... wish me luck leaving
500 2018-08-01 22:43:11 So car makes a thumping sound. Check engine light comes on periodically and goes away. Not a belt. Mechanic 1 said Knox sensor went out. Mechanic 2 said cylinder abt to fail. Difference is 200 to fix versus new car. Mechanic 2 changed oil and sound stopped.
501 2018-08-01 22:43:10 I splashed hot oil straight from the fryer on my arm. Then I burned my thumb on the grill. One of these other jobs needs to call me back. Fuuuck

503 2018-08-01 22:43:05 @carlsonmargaret Trump tells big tall tales + the more it is necessary for him to con the public the more lies + hyperbole he uses like the SNAKE OIL SALESMAN that he is.
504 2018-08-01 22:43:04 Western countries are dependent upon oil rich countries...so bounce back is always an option.
505 2018-08-01 22:43:02 now that i think about it, my mom taught me how to cut grass, shovel snow, change my oil, pump gas all that. lmao she never taught me how to do my laundry or cook those things just came naturally lol
506 2018-08-01 22:42:56 The real income from crude oil is hidden. But by studying Cam. BIP you can coincidentally see how it tremendously rise in time of high oil prices. Oil is the most important source of income of that regime. And 80% lies in the Southern Cameroons.
507 2018-08-01 22:42:44 Jajajaja oil debe echarse para resbalar no mas.
508 2018-08-01 22:42:43 vitamin E oil for your face really does wonders 
509 2018-08-01 22:42:38 But saying, “Let’s inconvenience people using mass transit to protest an oil pipeline” is a REALLY bad idea.
510 2018-08-01 22:42:36 As it is in another oil-nation where I come from: Norway. But Sweden and Denmark does that too, and they do not have a drop of oil. It is not expensive for a country, it is the only right thing to do.
511 2018-08-01 22:42:31 Beware the snake oil salesman version of health insurance. Be sure to read the small print. Be sure you do not get sick or have an accident whilst relying on this insurance coverage. Take precautions and build-up a $100,000 personal health care cushion cause you're gonna need it.
512 2018-08-01 22:42:22 Exactly man

I can't wait to share the oil with family & say my buddy Kyle & a partner shipped it or to be sitting in my yard with my dad smoking Ivan cigars around the fire.
513 2018-08-01 22:42:15 Elon starts an oil company: "wait, we have to, um, make payroll?"
514 2018-08-01 22:41:39 I know a few in oil that make that much but that’s about it
515 2018-08-01 22:41:11 My skin has improved vastly. Like now I only clean with her oil unless I wanna do a scrub.
516 2018-08-01 22:40:59 What kind of school buys oil based finger paints? 

Too bad about the jacket though
517 2018-08-01 22:40:41 My guess is that this woman was either on the rag or she's in menopause. Either way, she could use a good B Complex and some magnesium to deal with her anger. And, lavender essential oil on her chest to boot. Perhaps she's heard of 4-7-8 breathing as well?
518 2018-08-01 22:40:31 so far my favorite porno. because how good a bike wash can be. It has everything I find sexy. oil, she oiled herself again and again for 1 orgasmuss geil to be fucked hard.
2. It is ecstatic, and fulfilling, very beautiful, sexy, emotional affair, and just plain dirty.
519 2018-08-01 22:40:20 Probably because they know that if they take their protests to some of the other major oil producing countries, there won't be any trace of their existence.

Safety first!
520 2018-08-01 22:40:17 Oooh gotcha! Thanks love! I’m gonna try the oil cleanser and night creme!

524 2018-08-01 22:39:40 I love the oil cleanser, I like the night cream and pretty much the serums too and the berry scrub. I’m ordering her milk cleanser and day Creme this go round and it lasts forever
525 2018-08-01 22:39:39 Oil companies would love that if cash flow didn't matter :)
526 2018-08-01 22:39:33 You lack knowledge about the oil business. The state of Cameroon made the money with the oil of #SouthernCameroons before it was even tapped. You sell rights to drill. The English knew from the late 1950s about the oil and tried to force SC into Nigeria.
527 2018-08-01 22:39:23 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
528 2018-08-01 22:39:23 My boss brought her cbd oil to use on me today. That shit was magic. She’s 65. This is awesome lol.

& less from The US. 
531 2018-08-01 22:38:53 I'm with Jay. Just the physics of ice cream and boiling oil seem to go against science and stuff. Where's Bill Nye when you need him?
532 2018-08-01 22:38:51 うむむ
533 2018-08-01 22:38:48 @LIBGyal  I missed the oil cleanser again 
534 2018-08-01 22:38:47 Who knows how to change car oil ?
535 2018-08-01 22:38:34 ですかねぇ……二回しかしてなかったとしても、実行が1だったから変なんですよね……
536 2018-08-01 22:38:28 I love the oil cleanser and the berry mask. Ima try the milk cleaner and I love the night Creme so ima get the day Creme as well
537 2018-08-01 22:38:12 Some long-winded mf'ers.
538 2018-08-01 22:37:59 "Dark times"?  Under Harper?  At least people had a job in the oil sector (like my son) and other places, good paying jobs, not minimum wage.   Wait until you see the results of this Nncompoop as he bashes Trump for cheap support of uninformed electorate.
539 2018-08-01 22:37:46 おっそうだな(適当)
540 2018-08-01 22:37:41 Russia is selling more oil and natural gas than ever
541 2018-08-01 22:37:35 While im here id like to review the body shop vitamin e oil and eye cream. 10/10. My fave is hydrated N dewy and radiant. Recommend most definitely.
542 2018-08-01 22:37:29 ??
うーん反映が遅いのかしら

544 2018-08-01 22:37:06 They’re more than 4 ma’am but I get what you mean they’re nice though I always get them. I like that they put olive oil garlic and mushrooms as well
545 2018-08-01 22:37:04 Of course in true liberal fashion they helped those sectors based primarily in Ontario and Quebec. The oil and gas sector because it's based in the west was screwed again.
546 2018-08-01 22:36:41 Now there's just nothing that can be done about the physical driving hangover effects that are kicking my ass right now, but time. Hopefully tonight's sleep takes care of it. Time to do laundry, clean my bathroom of air wick oil slick death traps, and relax!
547 2018-08-01 22:36:32 From the photo if a tractor had broken down and oil split from its engine I'd like to know how there's oil either side of the tyre track.
548 2018-08-01 22:36:30 Castor oil & beard oil. I asked my daddy lol
549 2018-08-01 22:36:26 I'll never forget the time my high school CHEMISTRY teacher who I previously respected said "they always say we only have 50 years worth of oil but then they find more so I didn't bother worrying" and "bleach doesn't kill germs, it just polishes dirt" LMAO how was he employed
550 2018-08-01 22:36:14 I use it for skin and scalp. I prefer to cook in grass-fed butter or ghee personally, but coconut oil works shockingly well for dry skin. 

All the stuff we use like soaps and shampoos are littered w/endocrine disruptors
551 2018-08-01 22:36:01 確かに三回製造してわざわざ快速使ったのにクリアされてなくて……
552 2018-08-01 22:35:58 Who got them oil cartridges or whatever
553 2018-08-01 22:35:43 I followed this youtubers advice and massage it into my scalp overnight the night before a wash. Cus it’s oil so of course you look greasy ass hell when you wake up lol. And i just wash my hair. I do it every other wash. My hair was at my shoulders last year nd it’s at my ass now
554 2018-08-01 22:35:39 @BabestationTV @BethUndressed is the total package talks filth at the highest level, stunning looks she is unreal, wonder if Ashley’s Emma has left her body cream/oil in the building and Beth will let us use it on her

559 2018-08-01 22:34:15 He keeps trying to get sanctions against Russia dropped, refuses to enforce the ones Congress voted on last year
Trump's campaign staff was making secret deals with Russian oil co.
So Germany buys Russian oil
So do we
NATO tensions only help Putin, Trump's on Putin's team

560 2018-08-01 22:33:57 Horrible! He just wants to take care of his rich buddies that have their hands in the oil business! Once again, he doesn't care about the American people or the Earth's resources - $$$ is only thing #trump cares about! #Evil #trumpsucks

561 2018-08-01 22:33:56 Watched the movie All the Money in the World. Great performance by Christopher Plummer. Take away was Getty got rich using tax loopholes - tax-free family charitable foundation built Getty Oil. Even got tax deduction for grandson's ransom.
562 2018-08-01 22:33:43 Thanks! It's definitely an oil lamp. I'm now just seeking which cultural background it's from. I'm not sure it's Greco-roman... Thanks for your help!
563 2018-08-01 22:33:41 I don’t know what I’d do without my essential oil diffuser
564 2018-08-01 22:33:36 Why wouldn't we look for oil in the Great Australian Bight? Do we have an economic death wish?
565 2018-08-01 22:33:33 Date idea: take me to Lucas Oil on August 9th. Leave me there.
566 2018-08-01 22:33:15 What??
567 2018-08-01 22:33:15 Read your own article. You're confused. The money on the pallets belonged to the Monarchy!

The oil money was just example of iran's patronage system. The deal was with the monarchy, not islamic repub.

Typical lib ploy, bring up other issues 

BTW, are you an anti-Semite?

570 2018-08-01 22:32:18 Oil agree with that
571 2018-08-01 22:32:17 Yes. Best of both worlds. Seems like oil n water at the moment. Seems like we are just drifting further in the wrong direction. And, a tremendous number of disconnected agendas. N funding of the wrong or useless tech. Trying to fit a market to a product instead of other way.
572 2018-08-01 22:31:59 $71 looks important Support on Brent Oil Spot and of course  $70 after that. If latter fails then maybe it's prelude to weaker Oil Price ahead.
573 2018-08-01 22:31:42 The guy that changed my oil essentially knew the manual to my car by heart and I was NOT impressed

579 2018-08-01 22:30:10 It's definitely an oil lamp. I think it's a bull's head. However, I've not come across one quite like this from a greco-roman background and it was in the same group as the leg fragments. I don't think they are greek/ Hellenistic, but I could be wrong!

591 2018-08-01 22:28:21 Canada is not competitive. This is why your CO2 tax has 
been scaled back. Be mindful that CDN GDP growth of, maybe 2.5%, is pale compared to USA of 4.1%. If it were were not for OIL AND THE USA we would be in recession

603 2018-08-01 22:26:10 it's really weird how my entire life we've been striving for more efficient cars, and suddenly here's Trump saying it's a bad thing. I wonder which oil company executive drafted this for him?

610 2018-08-01 22:25:42 You make my point for me, a private company HAS done this, but they do it for their own power and profit to the stifling exclusion of others. Seriously, we've done this before pick up an american history book. Standard oil, gen electric, atlantic rail... FFS.

620 2018-08-01 22:24:07 Yes, there are some changes hat could be done to the oil fund, as found in the party program of SV (socialist left) however, this is not what either the red party or SV is currently focusing on or is concerned about

626 2018-08-01 22:23:27 David..just out of curiosity, what leads you to think a pipeline would cause more oil spills? 
Trains, trucks etc come with a far greater risk of spills. Oil is going to move to matter what. So doesn’t the safest possible option seem logical to you?

645 2018-08-01 22:20:35 did somebody mention oil boom?
646 2018-08-01 22:20:17 There’s been several articles on it. If you don’t believe it maybe you can explain why they want to stop TM from getting ethical oil to the world but are completely fine with importing from Saudi?
647 2018-08-01 22:20:08 And I agree with @MattBruenig. We were what I would consider a pretty darn social democratic country up until we elected a super right winged government for two terms. As well, arguing that Norway is not socialist by just looking at the oil fund is very one sided.

Now, we actually give money to Israel and they're actually terrorizing Palestinians, are you okay with that? And please spare us the Palestinians do it to BS because they throw rocks.
698 2018-08-01 22:13:43 cliché argument that has become stale. You can sing oil from the rooftop but in the next 4 years it will be the most valuable & profitable club in the world. The inception of its glory won't matter @brfootball
699 2018-08-01 22:13:36 Been listening to stuff about oil painting and now I wanna go home and paint.

702 2018-08-01 22:13:06 美術館に飾られている事が作品の要素ならゴミに落書きしたモノでも作品になるはず。
703 2018-08-01 22:12:35 Again no arguments that Obama sucked. But you also might want to look at how dependent your ideal countries like Sweden have been on oil production.
704 2018-08-01 22:12:18 Workers are not  being paid a living wage, with decent benefits. Even the article you posted comes with a huge caveat:"Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signaling the threat." More snake oil.

708 2018-08-01 22:11:39 Getting a oil change
709 2018-08-01 22:11:35 It would be interesting to find out! But I suppose with the beets & carrots, lemon juice or vinegar with a bit of olive oil would be fine. It's hard to tell what's in the quinoa but maybe it doesn't need dressing because the avocado provides enough richness.
710 2018-08-01 22:11:31 Foreign big oil
711 2018-08-01 22:11:24 There are a lot of things that we need to consider what drive prices up/down: season, supply & demand, oil prices, competition & gov’t international flight taxes/fees.
712 2018-08-01 22:11:22 They didn’t.... no it’s oil based.... and I may have gotten frustrated and burnt it.
713 2018-08-01 22:11:13 Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti , Sudan will be the greatest most developed region in Africa.Oil, tourism in Horn of Africa, massive Ethiopian economy and farming system and before Somalis fix their shit & offer the biggest sea port in Africa we are yet to see dust as East Africans.
714 2018-08-01 22:11:12 acv, natural honey, black seed oil, strawberries, cranberry juice and maca powder blended so good.
715 2018-08-01 22:11:12 I’m currently frying sausages with a jacket on cause the oil/grease keeps popping’ me. 
716 2018-08-01 22:11:06 Can we build a big slingshot and shoot them up into the space?
717 2018-08-01 22:11:03 Oh yeah I got caught up in this. Have to make sure the only ingredient is peanuts. If it doesn't have an inch of oil sitting on top its BS
718 2018-08-01 22:11:01 Trudeau is just protecting Rail profits! Buffet! Gates,Koch’s all are big in Rail lines! Pipelines would kill their monopoly on oil shipping! Also look at who owns oil Tankers! Pipelines would basically kill the need for Saudi and African,Venezuelan oil in Canada?
719 2018-08-01 22:10:59 I kind of do that. Put sunblock on my arms where is darker and tanning oil everywhere else but for some reason my chest and upper and don't tan as much as lower belly and thighs which were equally as white as my chest
720 2018-08-01 22:10:48 Is the DNC investigating or the FBI? Not safeguarding the hardware/chain of evidence looks fishy. You also forgetting the faked Steele dossier. Also wouldn't have Russia profited from Hillary winning. Trump allowed Fracking and USA is now getting to be the biggest Oil exporter.
721 2018-08-01 22:10:44 But it wasn't even during the meeting? Everyone saying it was after H15! No rider would ride with oil on the track anyway, so meeting would have stopped if it happened during. Just shit stirring, NKI didn't mention it in his tweet!!

727 2018-08-01 22:10:05 And how long have people been claiming peak oil is upon us? Since the 70’s. Meanwhile we have moved towards other energy sources. We have ways of dealing with finite resources. It’s called new technologies

731 2018-08-01 22:09:30 I agree Cheryl! I wish the Oil would try at least a little bit...
732 2018-08-01 22:09:25 And now people are having a pop at you! You clearly added that you witnessed the oil poured onto the track & that it wasn't a tractor leak. 
This was practiced years ago & came up in a recent twitter convo between riders.
733 2018-08-01 22:09:22 (also fracking and other methods of oil extraction are incredibly toxic to the environment but of course the market doesn't care)

"I should HOPE not. The French are famed for their knife skills."
744 2018-08-01 22:08:27 $10K? Are all the other POTUS portraits original oil canvases  or are they using gold and platinum for paint? Granted there should be a portrait, but that $10K is too pricey.

751 2018-08-01 22:07:46 we're going to run out of oil eventually. we keep finding new deposits, sure, but that won't last forever.
752 2018-08-01 22:07:34 I’m so hungry and sleepy. I fell asleep while my car got an oil change
753 2018-08-01 22:07:29 Thats a no on the Koch Bros and their buddies the right to dump their toxic waste into your drinking water and the air you breathe as they corner the market on bottled water. Trump allowed an oil pipeline across the bottom of a fresh water lake - on a reservation of course.
754 2018-08-01 22:07:18 Hi mate, good luck on your journey back to health. We cured my dad with cannabis oil, but a lot of other things too. Removing sugar is massively important, a lot stronger CBD is needed. Happy to share info if you wanted a chat 
755 2018-08-01 22:07:07 I say commission an oil painting
756 2018-08-01 22:07:06 It's hard to find many processed foods that don't have some vegetable oil in the ingredients somewhere.
757 2018-08-01 22:07:05 Seems like the oil of Prophecy is on you.
758 2018-08-01 22:07:01 from what it looks like maybe Seth Green is concerned for his mentally ill friend and wants him to get help before sending him a cease and desist letter?
759 2018-08-01 22:07:00 If my girlie* friends only accept one piece of beauty advice this month let it be this: Indulge in a bottle of Loreal Extraordinary Oil. It is the must wonderful treat you will ever give your hair. 

*Advice also open to boy friends looking for super soft, shiny hair.
760 2018-08-01 22:06:59 And not at all because shit fuel economy means big oil companies ( trump donators) will sell more oil, and raise the profits they pay so little tax on, even more. Nope. No siree. Never even entered my head.....
761 2018-08-01 22:06:58 I’m saying if you want to talk about rationing already to what people need food seems like the most important part. You sound like the people who have been arguing over peak oil wrongly for the past 50 years.
762 2018-08-01 22:06:53 • stay hydrated 
• use tea tree oil
• use a mud/charcoal mask
• keep a balanced & healthy diet
• avoid dairy
• wash your hands after using the bathroom (hopefully you do anyway)

848 2018-08-01 21:58:04 June Last yr a big bag of Beans was 65k, & Guinea Corn, 15k. This yr d highest price has been 38k & 8k resp. Today I came across a new asphalt plant being installed, another sign of growth. Forte Oil and JB declared profits. 2nd  Npower batch starts. Things re getting better.
849 2018-08-01 21:57:51 Show of hands:  how many think Bram Stoker's immortal vamp #Dracula looks like a razor-faced Texas oil baron in the mind's eye?
850 2018-08-01 21:57:49 2009, private investors wanted to build hotels around Basra airport. For the oil companies Representing Marriott, Kempinski, etc. MoT offered a max 5 year land lease!  One reason why Basra is not like Erbil now.
851 2018-08-01 21:57:38 @SuzyQ44ks my dream job is to be the guy who gets to oil your tits then suck them 
852 2018-08-01 21:57:36 Sugar, refined carb & veg oil cocktail brings down the peeps. And genetic susceptibility is a nice accelerator.
853 2018-08-01 21:57:35 Mozzarella, basil, Tomatoes, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Sometimes minus the condiments.
854 2018-08-01 21:57:23 Ummm..... Actually that's what he is saying, look what he is doing. Picking a fight with Iran will shoot up oil prices like crazy
855 2018-08-01 21:57:21 You know the Model 3 is great when the Koch Brothers & big oil hate it.
856 2018-08-01 21:57:21 Me self shock
857 2018-08-01 21:57:20 And snake oil
858 2018-08-01 21:57:19 I have 2 mowers...1 push mower for the edges and tight spots and a Toro 25 inch walk behind with all wheel drive and speed settings...I wash each mower deck when finished every mow...every Spring I change the oil, filters and Spark plug along with sharpening both blades...
859 2018-08-01 21:57:18 It is a lie, the sharing can't be rising when foreign reserve is all time high despite low oil price, the government completing abandoned projects, 500 000 volunteers receiving 30K a month, feeding kids in school, cash transfer to the poor, pensioner getting their pay
860 2018-08-01 21:57:13 Don't forget the pinch of salt, use oil now, can remember using dripping and lard in the past. .
861 2018-08-01 21:57:01 @LisaMurkowski the Senator in Alaska has been funding her life through allowing Corporations to drill in the Arctic & she merely has her attorney state, they simply mitigate then litigate. When AK is no longer in your hands, there shall be no oil spills or further trophy hunting
862 2018-08-01 21:56:56 If u don't feel like you have an oily ass face, try not to ask a sheet of oil control film from me and eventually waste it, pweeeettttty pweaaase?
863 2018-08-01 21:56:30 Animal fats make animals fat too.  Lard and butter are just as fattening as soybean oil in rodents.
864 2018-08-01 21:56:22 Yay, more Saudi oil for David :)
865 2018-08-01 21:55:57 I read it and I must admit I feel enlightened. Still, I don’t see how this  all is not pouring oil on fire
866 2018-08-01 21:55:57 Just a reminder @RepRaulGrijalva just co-sponsored bill to help hand control of #NationalParks to  Trump's Big Oil agenda
867 2018-08-01 21:55:51 Update: got my oil changed and I’m heading home
868 2018-08-01 21:55:40 I wanted to cancel my oil change bc I’m drained from being anxious all day but I was too anxious to call and cancel 
869 2018-08-01 21:55:34 I keep going back to that scene from The Office...

Angela: "Under no circumstances should a man strip off his clothes in this office."
Meredith: "Shut up, Angela!"
870 2018-08-01 21:55:32 Your right she certainly isn't no oil painting herself more like a faded water colour 
871 2018-08-01 21:55:28 One side of the story..............interesting to hear the real story.............why would a club pour oil on the track............would that not be sabotaging their own riders as well?????????  track was the same for everyone and Poole would not deliberately do that #sorelosers
872 2018-08-01 21:55:27 It was bonkers, just bonkers. The same company operated oil rigs. You'd think they'd be more concerned with those.
873 2018-08-01 21:55:21 Just got a call from a oil company, I should have a job offer by next week! Woohooo!!
874 2018-08-01 21:55:20 That track is shocking looks like my back lawn and it’s better to use water than oil
875 2018-08-01 21:55:10 Me: damn Maria ate a whole bottle of fish oil 

Brandon: damn...... bet that bitches coat is gunna shine
876 2018-08-01 21:55:03 That’s what I’ve been doing! My hair grows like a weed without heat. I haven’t had heat since December ( I try to straighten every 6 months for a length check) I use wild growth oil and mint almond oil mixed together and I take sugar bear hair
877 2018-08-01 21:54:52 Put tanning oil on your bottom half and sun block on the top
878 2018-08-01 21:54:26 #WhatDidBuhariDo: Buhari wasn't president when wheat farming collapsed and Cote d'Ivore overtook us in Cocoa production. 

Buhari didn't destroy Iwopin paper mill or ALSCON in Ikot-Abasi, a single factory that at a point brought in 30% equivalent of what we got from oil. @Ayourb
879 2018-08-01 21:54:22 Lies are deadly. And its as much a lie to pretend not to know something than to claim to know something. Oil companies lied about their knowledge of their effects on climate. Now it is killing people. Make them bear responsibility.

883 2018-08-01 21:53:08 I hate when people take dry beach picsput on some oil 
884 2018-08-01 21:53:03 Okay but does anyone genuinely know the difference (or care about the difference) between regular olive oil and extra Virgin olive oil
885 2018-08-01 21:52:48 that’s just oil and sweat on his body combined with a professional photographer lmaooo, y’all goofy
886 2018-08-01 21:52:09 No. Joboboa/vitamin e oil mix

Plzzz put the 3 inside 
Plzzzzz

Na so ona take they turn the place to oil well.
889 2018-08-01 21:51:55 You realise combustible fluids such as vegetable oil are not flammable at room temperature, you can smoke all you want near it. You don't need to be @thunderf00t to debunk that.
890 2018-08-01 21:51:45 To get my nails done ... or put oil in my car 
891 2018-08-01 21:51:13 Popeye The Sailor was funded by Big Spinach to sell their product in a failing produce market, they teamed up with Big Cooking Oil to name his love interest Olive to sell that too, I will be turning off replies to this tweet thank you
892 2018-08-01 21:51:11 #auntie pro tip. 
You go out for a meal and they put enough on your plate for three people. U can quietly say, “let me take this home” and get U some olive oil and salt and pepper and not spend another penny for the next day. Just did it. 
893 2018-08-01 21:50:51 Making garlic herb roasted with olive oil baked fries. With chicken and Jersey fresh veggies.
894 2018-08-01 21:50:48 than reduce electricity & gas bills, food items   like oil, flour, sugar.
& make necessary for all companies including private to give minimum wages 20K, increase the Quota for women for public sector jobs...consider the disable people also...
895 2018-08-01 21:50:48 These clowns on the Tesla earnings call are in the wrong city.  They should be in Sarasota trying to revive the circus, not trying to save a circus.  Elon Musk is obviously sleep deprived, and common sense deprived.  They are letting the cat out of the bag now......
896 2018-08-01 21:50:37 Just rub some castor oil on them.
897 2018-08-01 21:50:33 I wish I was born to a mom with curly hair so she knew how to actually do my hair. Instead, she gave me heat damage and doesn’t even know what coconut oil is. Damaged my hair to the point where it wasn’t curly anymore and then I cut it off because I couldn’t save it. Shits wack.
898 2018-08-01 21:50:14 Trump is trying to make life a bit better for his oil company buddies. What a pal!
899 2018-08-01 21:50:12 and tea tree oil!! or eucalyptus oil 
900 2018-08-01 21:50:00 Before oil money took over!

902 2018-08-01 21:49:35 There hasn’t been a lot of options for fossil fuels to this day. It’s not because the big oil companies forbid it. Even with new technology we haven’t found a way to disconnect from fossil fuels. There hasn’t been a viable alternative available.
903 2018-08-01 21:49:34 First thing that came to mind is oil down.
904 2018-08-01 21:49:16 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
905 2018-08-01 21:49:15 Looking forward to it, nice to be back down, got my carrot oil ready!! 
906 2018-08-01 21:49:07 bravo? bread and oil.
907 2018-08-01 21:49:07 Micah 16:33 And he poured oil upon the altar;
908 2018-08-01 21:49:03 Well,  sketchbooks come with different purposes. Like pencil, pastel, watercolour, ink. - and multipurpose.
There are chalk and oil pastels. I prefer chalk, myself.
Michael’s has young artist sets with sets of a lot of things to try and they can be great. Currie’s has them too.
909 2018-08-01 21:48:57 coconut oil is definitely good for the skin 
910 2018-08-01 21:48:54 Heat your eyelash curlers gently before using - helps the curl last longer. And use coconut oil to remove your mascara, helps negate any drying effects it may have on your lashes 
911 2018-08-01 21:48:38 Motor oil RT @_ImYourPusha_: Wanna try a new lube. Suggestions?
912 2018-08-01 21:48:27 You think veganism doesn't kill? Pesticides? Herbicides? Exposed soils, run off and siltation? Oil based fertilizers and eutrophication? Modern arable farming is full of killing - just hidden.
913 2018-08-01 21:48:01 So you can see that #usa supports and betrays, uses terrorist organisations like #pkk #pyd #ypg #sdf #daesh.
American citizens must ask theirselves, why their children are used to fight thousands miles away in #Iraq #syria.
Coz Uncle Sam wants to steal oil&mines. To sell armors.
914 2018-08-01 21:47:56 Finally found a diagram on how the oil cooler set up is and I’m stokedddd
915 2018-08-01 21:47:51 I actually take the car to the shop for most things harder than replacing the wipers or a burned out bulb. I even take the car in for oil changes.
916 2018-08-01 21:47:39 Paraffin mixed with oil, petrol, diesel, gas, spirit, benzeneFire!!!
917 2018-08-01 21:47:31 Do any other PoC determine how hot it is by the consistency of your coconut oil?
918 2018-08-01 21:47:27 Honest question, do you drink alcohol and maintain being able to look like that with your shirt off, and if so what do you drink?
919 2018-08-01 21:47:14 Speedway fan not any team 
Can’t imagine any club puts oil on track to make it slick
 10w40 tonight lads 
He can’t win every night PRICK
920 2018-08-01 21:47:08 You can buy zinc oxide from amazon and mix it with coconut oil. All the ingredients to make personal care products are easily available. No one has to buy manufactured garbage.
921 2018-08-01 21:47:07 Sitting in the line to get my oil changed and the guys gonna be baffled when I drive up with a kitten in my lap 
922 2018-08-01 21:47:01 You didn't visit him in that Tel Aviv resort then, Kate? No?... or inspect his share of Golan oil sand?... No...?

You don't fool anyone except the dumbed down low information people you lot broadcast to.
923 2018-08-01 21:46:41 Wilbur says  Ok, mom'ma I just took a bath,  time to get my teeth brushed ...he actually puts toothbrush in his mouth, lol......oooooooh he's so delicious  btw, I brush his teeth and gums with coconut oil and tumeric. 
924 2018-08-01 21:46:40 disagree with the oil, but everything else, yes.
925 2018-08-01 21:46:40 This is the Jim Jones sequel. Everyone drink the KoolAid but first sign every last penny you have over to the snake oil salesman.
926 2018-08-01 21:46:37 It wasn’t a bomb. Someone was making honey oil.
927 2018-08-01 21:46:34 . When crude oil dey for plastic rice production
928 2018-08-01 21:46:30 I would put conditioner then oil... no curl.... puts oil the conditioner ... curls... someone explain to me the logic.
929 2018-08-01 21:46:19 Great news! We do sell an oil based Matte product in Puerto Rico. It can be found under the product name HPC DevGuard (4308) at any of the Glidden/PPG stores in Puerto Rico! Please note the color is a pre-mixed (pre-tinted) black.
930 2018-08-01 21:46:12 We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
931 2018-08-01 21:46:12 More gold in play > pissed that away > Oil is also is play now > watch out turkey > trump will sent tweet >

937 2018-08-01 21:45:29 They’ve been buying oil from Saudi Arabia but I just see them staying out of any war as it would not have any benefits of them getting involved on any side
938 2018-08-01 21:45:24 You need send her a bottle of holy oil then  she needs deliverance frfr
939 2018-08-01 21:45:12 I understand what you mean when I have a lousy head etc. essential oil diffusion is the only place I have to go to being on max dose. My addiction tweets were more about the broad scale alcohol, drugs etc. not pain meds
940 2018-08-01 21:45:03 Turns like an oil tanker
941 2018-08-01 21:44:59 rose & calendula body oil on my legs, vitamin c oil on my face 
942 2018-08-01 21:44:56 frying requires oil soooooo it's baked
943 2018-08-01 21:44:55 Politicians talk about “foreign oil”. That’s an ignorant statement.  There’s no such thing as foreign oil. It’s just oil. It’s a Global commodity. Politicians try to alarm people by saying “foreign oil”.  Just like Trump saying “Russian” gas.
944 2018-08-01 21:44:49 Bit of a grease and oil change and she'd be sweet!

946 2018-08-01 21:44:24 Wasn’t he supposed to be looking for a job?
947 2018-08-01 21:44:14 I did a secondment at a very large oil and gas manufacturer and their H&S bods assessed that the most serious risk at the HQ were stairs. People were trained on how to use them. I kid you not. There were notices everywhere giving instructions for use.
948 2018-08-01 21:44:04 Wrote words, revised other words, talked to mom, did laundry, got oil changed, bought dish soap, got car washed, sorted mail, treated kids to ice cream cones, dropped boy off at taekwondo. #reaganing
949 2018-08-01 21:44:02 We HAD cap and trade. Wynne was against it in '14 btw. It was a tax of ~1.9B in 2017. It raised the price of gasoline (that stuff cars use to run), diesel fuel (that stuff that trucks, trains, and buses use to run), natural gas/oil/propane (that stuff used for heating homes).
950 2018-08-01 21:44:00 Bi oil 40€ au pharmacies
951 2018-08-01 21:43:41 So many Provinces are going to end up in a mess...some like New Brunswick trying to hold gas prices down for the people so what is Premier going to do beat up on Irving Oil & all the lumber mills better push back at Liberals now same as PEI is doing.
952 2018-08-01 21:43:19 self care tip for artists!! oil paint can be doubled up as facial moisturiser :)
953 2018-08-01 21:43:18 Jesus fuck Jim. All the data about oil revenues is in GERS. You want to talk about oil revenues and it’s source then deny the very source you use to promote it.
954 2018-08-01 21:43:18 My 18th and 19th century antiques are lovingly cleaned with oil and then waxed by hand rubbing. But us antiques lovers are a crazy people. We just can't help ourselves. It is an addiction usually strikes early in adulthood.
955 2018-08-01 21:42:59 Yes everyone I’m an adult and just now realized that evening primrose oil does not only need to be taken in the evening
956 2018-08-01 21:42:55 Heb 1:7. but tofn the Son: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.

960 2018-08-01 21:41:52 Just another snake oil salesman living the lifestyle of the rich & famous on his flock’s backs.
961 2018-08-01 21:41:52 Mostly?  Look better check your facts, last quarter job creation announcement was 38k with only 12k private sector. And flipping hamburgers or pour coffee. Doesn't count as a job to raise a family of pay your bills. Along ways from the 369k direct & indirect job lost in Oil/gas.
962 2018-08-01 21:41:39 Saddam was as evil & sadistic as they came.gassing the N Iraqi  Kurds..Invading Kuwaiit..Enviromentally dumping  the oil in the Gulf..and blowing up the oil rigs..all toxic
963 2018-08-01 21:41:36 speaking of essential oils, my kitchen smelled like peppermint all day and it was a pleasant surprise until I discovered that actually one of my kids had knocked over peppermint essential oil in a seldom used cabinet that now makes your eyes water and skin burn when opened.
964 2018-08-01 21:41:34 Actually Trump is working to lower oil prices, he asked the Saudi’s to pump MORE oil!

979 2018-08-01 21:40:06 Was talking to a store employee about a mutual guy friend we have and I stated I remember my friend having the softest skin. 

Mans ran to the back, slapped on some coconut oil/cocoa butter and asked me to feel his skin. LMAO.

It was soft too, I won’t lie.

981 2018-08-01 21:39:42 I HATE stains that don’t come out no matter what you do . Like it’s one of your favorites. Fits right . Looks right. The cotton level so light .  And then you grill in it and when you use that special grill brush and that oil shoots back at it it’s like dodging bullets and lose

983 2018-08-01 21:39:40 You certainly have lost the plot, he has not once complained about the track tonight, but when he saw track staff pouring the oil onto the track which was NOT mechanical failure it have to be addressed riders have to adhere to these rules so should clubs

994 2018-08-01 21:37:52 Does "revenue raised in Scotland" include Income Tax, NI, Vat, Duty on cigs, booze, oil, fuel, APD? Any others? What revenue is derived from exports to UK from Scotland? How much duty on fuel from the rest of the UK is generated by Scottish Oil. How much  to source elsewhere?

1020 2018-08-01 21:33:50 Trudeau brands himself on balance, but isn't much different result wise from Harper. Any minor gains from his weak carbon tax will be offset by growth in the oil sands.

1046 2018-08-01 21:30:11 Yes I’m very happy about that it was amazing.  But to have rules in the rule book then a club go against the rules with putting oil on a track.  It wasn’t a tractor failure because I see them pore a can over the track. I’m only against them going against the rules.
1047 2018-08-01 21:30:03 Hi @Blackmores, I understand the Flaxseed oil in your capsules comes from China. In spite of its organic certification, and given the endemic environmental pollution problems in that country, do you test your Flaxseed oil for contaminants, in the same way as you do your fish oil?

1051 2018-08-01 21:29:28 It really is. It’s one of my favorite/simplest things to cook. You gotta cook the kale with some olive oil, minced garlic and some red pepper flakes, then add a little bit of veggie broth to it, then season it with just some salt, black pepper, garlic powder and smoked paprika.

1057 2018-08-01 21:28:02 I don’t watch or listen, but from what I’ve seen from ppl playing clips to laugh at Jones’ rants, he mostly advertises his own snake oil supplements he ships from China. Some of them had to be pulled recently b/c they tested too high in lead to meet US standards.

1075 2018-08-01 21:26:08 Instead of giving tax breaks to wealthy people and corporate welfare to oil companies, they should be charged much higher rates. This might make companies reevaluate how Much they pay ceos who I think are grossly overpaid!!

1111 2018-08-01 21:20:50 wtf is 'triple churned' emulsified veg oil, sugar, sodium caseinate etc? The bottle was shaken hard three times? Churned is for butter. Cream should NOT be churned.
2x richer? More fat content than milk? I wonder if advert marketers understand words beyond the buzz they make.

1124 2018-08-01 21:19:32 Ready for this?! I scheduled my own doctors appointment, dentist appointment and oil change all in the same week? On top of already having my chiropractor appointment and massage appointment. Am I an adult yet?
1125 2018-08-01 21:19:16 You know, for a “grease monkey”, Cindy’s outfit makes her very prone to oil and soot and potential dangers when fixing a car. It’s also not an outfit anyone would even think of wearing around their grandfather .w.

1133 2018-08-01 21:18:15 Yup, one of Trump's fine white evangelical supporters ~ so Busted! How come the party of family vales (Republicans) have so many pedophiles? Anointed  snake oil.
1134 2018-08-01 21:18:05 Corporate welfare queens at Nestle suck. Oil, gas, and timber leases aren't much better of a deal for the people. And corporations dump poison in our air and water for free by extorting us with the threat of moving the jobs. This is not "Of the people, by the people". Go Abdul!

1141 2018-08-01 21:16:54 Not happy about the idea of feeding animals. One of best things about Conan is not having to come on every single day to do base chores, like Arks dino feeding and gassing up generators. I am worried... Next we will be feeding thralls and refilling all the oil lamps every day. 
1142 2018-08-01 21:16:41 Just like Korea? LOL. Iran is about oil. Shutting them down so Putin can jump in on it. Exxon and Tillerson were in Russia before Trump but the Obama sanctions stopped Putin’s oil dreams

1147 2018-08-01 21:15:54 #Ford, I just realized it wasn't condensation from the heat under my car, oil leak... almost bone dry after Ford did an oil/filter change just over a month ago. Not happy, practically new engine might be fucked. No oil lamp on, but dip stick showed nothing. Taking it in tomorrow.
1148 2018-08-01 21:15:48 It's actually "stimulation". They're used for interventions performed on an oil or gas wells to increase production by improving the flow of hydrocarbons from the drainage area into the well bore. Apparently. But I don't think it's doing that here. And thank you :)

1152 2018-08-01 21:15:36 :)  ... sadly however @eatright @aadediabetes @AmDiabetesAssn etc all promote the same low-fat, high-carb, grain-based, veggie oil laden diet.  With the vast majority of  RDs & CDEs in tow. 

Therein lies the credibility problem & increasing marketing  $'s won't help.

Thr was a pipeline taking oil away from Westcoast, oil shale, to Forth to be shipped out, in the 50s if not before. I know NE Eng was used as well, but Scotland was treated even worse, re housing, etc. I was shocked to see pics Exhib of 1970/80s Edin it looked like the 1930s!

1166 2018-08-01 21:13:52 The ordinary people knew nothing. I lay the blame at the door of the Unionist politicians at Westminster......especially the Scots Unionists. They hid the oil wealth from the people. They knew what it was worth.

1168 2018-08-01 21:13:40 Lmao! This is fine compared to a early 2000’s (i think) Chevy cavalier. Oil filter is tucked on the back side the motor between the firewall and the motor. Only way to get to it is have super long and scrawny arms and hope you don’t burn yourself on the motor or exhaust...

1179 2018-08-01 21:11:42 You can keep it for ages. But when you fry food in oil, toxic aldehydes build up, and re-using oil creates more. There are oils that aren't as bad, but, re-using is still going to create them

He said he was gambling with the "banks money".

1184 2018-08-01 21:10:50 I can’t even at the deli. We already have a perfectly good orange mild cheese and it’s called cheddar. I’m pretty sure American cheese is just another way for American companies to use a glut of corn oil.

It doesn't have to be a catastrophe when we hit peak, but it's smart to be prepared for changes. Fortunes will be made and lost in the transition.

1522 2018-08-01 20:19:59 Idk why we’re still in the Middle East. If the US gov knew about all the oil clogging up my pores they’d pacify the shit out my face in a heartbeat
1523 2018-08-01 20:19:58 Coconut butter & coconut oil got me smellin like Hawaii

1525 2018-08-01 20:19:47 I have nothing against a battered fry, but in general I think the best unbattered fries are better than the best battered fries because they require more craft to do correctly. I also find battered fries can sit like a brick after awhile as they seem to hold more oil.
1526 2018-08-01 20:19:45 I understand that completely and also that religion and politics mixing is like oil and water.

1527 2018-08-01 20:19:45 oh my god i did the oil and clay mask routine for my face and my nose has never been this smooth like all around a sis is CLEAR....it’s magic

1532 2018-08-01 20:19:02 Hello hello Susan!  Glad you're back with us!  You didn't miss a thing.  Just the normal stupidity from Liberals all week.
1533 2018-08-01 20:19:00 oh!イル
1534 2018-08-01 20:18:52 This is what happens when you have vast sums of lost, uneducated people. They’re subservient to snake oil salesmen, selling their bellies bill’s  of goods. Ignorance and anger are far too dangerous for Trump, Alex jones, and their ilk to be playing on the people emotion responses
1535 2018-08-01 20:18:50 Why did I just buy coconut oil for £10
1536 2018-08-01 20:18:50 Should I fill my oil tank now !!
1537 2018-08-01 20:18:42 DDD is appealing to snake oil consultants though because “on the surface” it is pretty impenetrable. I don’t think it is a lack of common sense, I think it is more a lack of critical thinking processes. We teach programming as if it starts at the keyboard, that's the fail.

1544 2018-08-01 20:17:46 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1545 2018-08-01 20:17:30 Actually they were producing electricity through furnance oil which was a temporary solution.
1546 2018-08-01 20:17:17 US 5th Fleet can control Staits of Hormuz. No Iranian crude oil out. No refined oil products in!

1547 2018-08-01 20:17:08 Thank You Sir! LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! As a member of the worried well, living within spitting distance of the Nations Largest Private Nuke Dump, it seemed to us Flaxseed oil + C60 was a perfect combination.

1553 2018-08-01 20:16:38 Airlines are a good play on oil prices .. enough cycles on the long and short side over the years . And you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand the business either
1554 2018-08-01 20:16:35 If u can't stand egg smell in hair use it with lemon... Lemon will give shine and will kill smell too, if oil is added than it will also help to kill the sticky Ness of oil..

1561 2018-08-01 20:15:30 And then you can use the same Logic Pro pen for either oil
1562 2018-08-01 20:15:29 I use oil, I've tried a medium but I varnish after so oiling out helps the varnish adhere as it's a retouching varnish & best with fresh paint.
1563 2018-08-01 20:15:20 It's a qay to artifically drive oil prices up and force people to have no choice but to pay.
1564 2018-08-01 20:15:08 I bought some pasta and olive oil in a back alley just now.
1565 2018-08-01 20:14:55 Hope not; somewhat defeats the purpose. Was told when this Deloitte deal was announced that oil reports would be audits, be both retrospective and monthly, and offer granular detail. No such luck.
1566 2018-08-01 20:14:51 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
1567 2018-08-01 20:14:48 People blaming Buhari instead of oil prices and corruption among PDP members in coming
1568 2018-08-01 20:14:42 Don't they have oil there?
1569 2018-08-01 20:14:40 P-Square were the first Nigerian Artistes to charg N15m for a show in Nigeria, had the highest international booking fee for years. Over 300 million YouTube views (monetizeable). One of their mansions is worth N500m & they went into Oil and Gas. They were an African label's dream
1570 2018-08-01 20:14:39 Have a look at our tv commercials. Chai/biscuit/masala/cooking oil ka kia taluk hai dance se. Bin qasim ne mirasiyon ko musilman bana k Pakistan main chor dia.

1572 2018-08-01 20:14:33 never expected them to be Chelsea have a billionaire oligarch and City have a government backed by a huge oil fund we have business men its a problem how much is going out but we cant stop it
1573 2018-08-01 20:14:32 Same thing with oil refineries in Venezuela.

To meet 2040 demand we will need 97 million barrels per day of new oil.

If everyone stopped drilling today what is online today would decline to 0 by 2040.

1589 2018-08-01 20:12:31 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

1601 2018-08-01 20:10:40 Wait, how would you say “oil” then?

Also, I have learned to not be ashamed of my dialect. I am Southern and educated!
1602 2018-08-01 20:10:35 I knew that I could be hearing some bad news so I prepared with a little #Peace Blend essential oil and reflecting on where we were just a day ago.#Serenity
1603 2018-08-01 20:10:23 I'm having one of those evenings where I just must not touch anything else. Oil based paint fail. Glass paint fail. Hair dye fail.

1606 2018-08-01 20:09:53 sesame oil is not necessarily a cooking oil but it's a great flavoring oil and works well with those two flavor profiles
1607 2018-08-01 20:09:35 That recipe was put out by sugar and olive oil producers.
1608 2018-08-01 20:09:32 Yeah. The government doesn't need the oil industry directly any more - we live off the proceeds from our fund now. But they employ a lot of people directly and indirectly.
1609 2018-08-01 20:09:29 Norway is second largest producer of oil too that might have something do with it

1618 2018-08-01 20:08:34 Decant most of the oil, add a generous amount of fresh lemon juice, cracked black pepper, salt, and dried (never fresh) basil. Add to boiled spaghetti. This has been a staple of mine for 30 years.

1629 2018-08-01 20:07:32 on a floorplan, what does the SPOV in “COFFEE/SPOV” stand for? Please tell me it's not “salt pepper oil vinegar"
1630 2018-08-01 20:07:26 the TMX pipeline is needed to get current oil to overseas markets. in the longer-term (beyond 2040), as demand for fossil fuels shrinks,  it'll likely not be needed. AB companies continue to use technology to reduce GHG emissions associated with O&G extraction
1631 2018-08-01 20:07:22 Zinke is a big oil puppet best of luck to you.
1632 2018-08-01 20:07:16 Politicians regularly criticize industries like banking, big oil, insurance, private equity, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, education, gun manufacturing, pro sports, etc. Why should journalism be off limits... especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking?

1635 2018-08-01 20:07:10 Guyssss, I just made coconut oil by myself for the first time, all thanks to @That_Ebonyichic. 
1636 2018-08-01 20:07:05 Glad you got a replacement. Save those shavings- next time you do an oil change for someone, “look what I found”.
1637 2018-08-01 20:07:05 Definitely don't put a shirt on 
1638 2018-08-01 20:06:43 Say what you want about the NDP but stop blaming “price of oil” problems on them. Stop deluding yourself that someone different is going to change that!
1639 2018-08-01 20:06:40 IRGC are the canniest actors in the Middle East, they won't be blocking the oil routes without the U.S. starting a war.
1640 2018-08-01 20:06:30 They should tell mr trump to stop provoking them by telling other countrues not to buy iranian' oil ,they do anything to protect it,the gulf of Hormuz dont need big naval force to close it ,just a ship or 2 can close it you can't use force to keep it open,it is not deep or wide.
1641 2018-08-01 20:06:16 Those are priced in USD, so WTI is about 85 CAD, Brent is 95 and our oil is being sold at a pathetic 50 CAD. 

NDP could have done more. Look at SK and ONT industries today getting breaks on carbon tax because they said something. NDP meanwhile rolled over when pipelines axed.
1642 2018-08-01 20:06:11 Got a delicious oil massage today and it would be so rude of me to tell the people who I imagined it to be massaging me

1652 2018-08-01 20:03:54 I noticed a lot of Teslas when I was there. And places to plug in. I also sensed that people feel a conflict between the wealth brought to Norway by oil and the harm burning it causes, and the desire to address that issue.

1656 2018-08-01 20:03:31 Agree that in 14-15 falling oil prices were a main driver of capital flows but the divergence between Russia & other EM commodity exporters since then is about sanctions. Russian banks are still losing external funding as of today because of sanctions I think

1659 2018-08-01 20:02:52 You set a table for me right in front of my enemies. You bathe my head in oil; my cup is so full it spills over! Yes, goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the LORD’s house as long as I live. Psalms 23:5-6

1665 2018-08-01 20:01:34 The mistake is what ppl think "resources" are. The Earth doesn't have them because nothing is inherently a resource, it's only what ppl happen to have a use for right now, which changes based on technology. Eg, oil wasn't a "resource" until the 19th c.

1668 2018-08-01 20:01:25 @Ford another complaint, I had taken my car in for recall work. They only did one, replacing steering column bolt and failed to repair seatbelt issue. Now I just noticed the car is leaking oil, for who knows how long, it's almost bone dry. Paid Ford $49.99 for oil/filter special.

1670 2018-08-01 20:01:19 Yeah. I couldn’t believe it. The only reason I take it in for oil is I don’t have a lift at home to get under and my driveway is a hill or I’d just do it myself.

1685 2018-08-01 19:59:11 I'm livid. Our landlord gave us a notice about the car leaving oil in the driveway... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? He's so petty and I am so over this bullshit.
1686 2018-08-01 19:59:10 Oh, we do. And we also have a large oil industry. They're slowly transitioning to offshore wind, but that's a large process. But most parties, even the conservative ones, work for real change. And we drive a lot of electric cars (almost 50% of all cars sold are now electric).
1687 2018-08-01 19:59:05 One of the best things you can do to extend the life of your car and avoid unexpected breakdowns is to check for fluid leaks. A small oil leak can go unnoticed for months, and you may not know anything is wrong until the oil, and the protection it provides, is far too low.

But I didn't understand the importance of externally applied oil for the building of muscle.
1694 2018-08-01 19:58:12 But it’s for large industry only, & as per federal carbon tax, not Provincial Carbon Taxes that already exist. Example: Alberta Oil refinery’s are carbon taxed by Notley’s NDP, & any oil & gas produced there, then consumed in Canada carries the tax burden forward to the consumer.
1695 2018-08-01 19:58:07 9 pictures and only 1 shows oil and gas. I can see you're quite proud.

It was great to fry the tomato paste with the onions in little rape seed oil but also it always had a much too sweet taste afterwards. Thats why i use the canned tomatoes now.

1794 2018-08-01 19:44:45 So why do you continue to fight for more fracking & oil wells yet oppose oil depletion tax, @GovJerryBrown?
1795 2018-08-01 19:44:44 Pake shampoo & condi mane n tail herbal grow, kadang pakein hairmask ginseng, pake penyubur rambut mustika ratu abis keramas, pake loreal extraordinary oil yg merah.

1796 2018-08-01 19:44:43 I use to love #Annesoil until @FaryalxMakhdoom started sponsoring it. It’s too much, too often. I personally prefer the #vatika oil range now. It works better.
1797 2018-08-01 19:44:39 I believe the beef is legit...I believe TT was on that oil and may have took a few swing...but I’m not putting my money on TT In vegas....naw

1800 2018-08-01 19:44:21 Ew why would I want to go there?!? The Christians are fake, it's hot as hell and we have our own damn oil.
1801 2018-08-01 19:44:00 Please stop pouring burning oil on your micropenis on my timeline thanks.
1802 2018-08-01 19:43:56 Literally had a great day went to dutchess to make sure my school stuff was straight and all set to go got an oil change and now about to fold these clothes  Ayden with his dad until tomorrow deff gotta wash my car
1803 2018-08-01 19:43:54 Not entirely true. Many people don't want to smoke it, and many may not even be allowed to( my apartment complex has a zero tolerance policy) so for medical purposes, the extracts of the plant may help. Many people benefit from cannabis oil.
1804 2018-08-01 19:43:43 Hard-coding a password is an insult to your profession that should bring shame to all involved.  It's like a mechanic draining the oil out of an engine and filling it with water.
1805 2018-08-01 19:43:29 Lol I should ask,when I was fully involved
1806 2018-08-01 19:43:29 When the jobs go and he has no one to blame but himself, I wonder what his excuse will be?  

Wake up America, we have an snake oil salesman selling you a whole ton of '$#!+' . 

Explain your choices to your family when you end up on welfare.
1807 2018-08-01 19:43:17 Type 4s usually need generally the same thing, a shit tone of moisture keep it soft and from breaking. Plus sealing with a sealant oil after moisturizing really helps retain the moisture
1808 2018-08-01 19:43:16 Son, you’re out of your depth. The Obama admin protected trade for IA farmers and promoted the RFS over polluters. Your guy started a trade war via twitter and gutted the RFS in favor of the oil industry. You might want to check w/ Tom Vilsack about who he wants 2 B Ag Secretary
1809 2018-08-01 19:43:02 Feel that way” and have me lavender essential oil to cure my sadness
1810 2018-08-01 19:42:58 I just ordered a phone case to oil paint and I can't wait for it to arrive, thanks Amazon prime free trial! 
1811 2018-08-01 19:42:40 You might be the prophyte that was talking about handcuffs & body oil.
1812 2018-08-01 19:42:39 They’re alright like, but add batter to smoking hot oil & they’ll rise even more than they did 
1813 2018-08-01 19:42:23 Are you going to do watercooling? Oil immersion? Liquid nitrogen?
1814 2018-08-01 19:42:16  ur head dey there 
1815 2018-08-01 19:42:14 They're oil burners
1816 2018-08-01 19:42:12 Bright may have an opinion here too, but IMO the demand for soybean oil for biodiesel won't change too much based upon blending margins.  Integrated crush plants will sell SME break-even to keep the protein spreads.
1817 2018-08-01 19:42:11 Takes fish oil pills 
1818 2018-08-01 19:42:09 Canadian heavy sour crude oil hits spring/summer lows. Peg WCS (Western Canadian Select) at $38.50-$39 bbl.  Good news for upper Midwest and Rocky Mountain refiners who can run that stuff, since the raw cost is under $1 gallon.
1819 2018-08-01 19:42:08 And illegal aliens vote and hold office? 
Come clean.
1820 2018-08-01 19:41:50 I'll try Jamaican oil 
Thank you 
1821 2018-08-01 19:41:46 That backs me up on the olive oil being pointless! (no idea what role the sugar plays, chemically. Slightly acid against the salt?)
1822 2018-08-01 19:41:45 The new #LosingEarth from @NYTmag is a sobering journey. But it misses a key point that while Big Oil /knew/ about climate change decades ago, they were never engaged in a "good faith effort" to stop it. They ignored their own scientists. That continues today.
1823 2018-08-01 19:41:14 So the really cute oil change guy who I always notice when I go get my oil changed finally made conversation today and the entire time he called me Fran. Fran is my moms name. 
1824 2018-08-01 19:41:09 Lol it takes a gee to get a gee DM is open fr ur sure Yankee aza and Canadian drops.
1825 2018-08-01 19:40:57 Powerful diarrhea after that squirt of Oil
1826 2018-08-01 19:40:57 Name the media types! I don't believe a word of your Tweet. You voted for him - you'll do it again. Propagandist.

#TheResistance
1827 2018-08-01 19:40:52 The people don't want him. If this is the case in Kano politics, nobody can save him not even Obasanjo in his days. Ask Kwankwaso and Shekarau they'll agree with me. 
1828 2018-08-01 19:40:45 I am trying to imagine a country that is subejecting people of a different faith within that country, shooting them, stealing the land they own,  poisoning orchards, olive oil trees,  if only this country wasn't Israel, the media would all over it and Newsnight
1829 2018-08-01 19:40:40 You should have boosted the economy years ago what happened all the money Thatcher saved through cuts what happened all the Scottish oil money where is all the money going that the goverenment got over the last 7 years of power ??bombing  countrys . There is no Brexit dividend.
1830 2018-08-01 19:40:33 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
1831 2018-08-01 19:40:12 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
1832 2018-08-01 19:40:01 Let’s hope it works out for you! I use Jamaican Oil now. It works , It just smells like shit.
1833 2018-08-01 19:39:38 If you're fine with doing slightly better than the rest of Canada's anemic economy things are looking up, but world oil prices are close to 100 CAD, we're not getting anything close to that. Would be doing a lot better if NDP hadn't given up on getting our resources to market..
1834 2018-08-01 19:39:22 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
1835 2018-08-01 19:39:16 on a serious note have you tried adding and cooking her food in coconut oil?? loads of research going on
1836 2018-08-01 19:39:12 Strike oil. Get rich. Sad.
1837 2018-08-01 19:39:07 It’s an oil tanker mate. Will take time to turn it all round. Give him 18 months
1838 2018-08-01 19:38:58 Sweating in a salt bath with rose oil.
1839 2018-08-01 19:38:54 I hate jiffy lube... every time I go in for an oil change they come out wit a 1,000 problems wit ur car 
1840 2018-08-01 19:38:38 I’ve been fighting off squirrels from my bird feeder for years. Spraying them with a mixture of water with peppermint essential oil has helped but not totally. 
I bought a pump action water gun. Now when they don’t even wait to see the gun before running. #respect
1841 2018-08-01 19:38:27 lol
1842 2018-08-01 19:38:26 I need to get my oil changed badly 
1843 2018-08-01 19:38:13 sunday riley ufo oil, skinfood strawberry mask and skinfood watermelon mask
1844 2018-08-01 19:38:09 Her car is wrapped around a telephone pole, spilling oil and gas.
1845 2018-08-01 19:38:08 So lemme get this straight;

As we witness the ice caps melt, instead of being inspired into changing our ways, we’re gonna invest in military hardware to fight for the remaining oil that’s left beneath the ice? 

But what happens when it’s all gone?
1846 2018-08-01 19:38:05 Making everyone at jiffy lube watch @shanedawson’s new video with me while I’m getting an oil change. 

I was gonna try to wait 30 minutes till I got home to see it but I have no self control when it comes to Shane tbh.
1847 2018-08-01 19:38:01 Acende, puxa, prende passa !!
1848 2018-08-01 19:37:59 This bin filled again, now with industrial-size cooking oil. Seems we've got someone dumping commercial waste here, regularly. Also food trays left on parallel street, Dudley Drive.
1849 2018-08-01 19:37:54 With Olive Oil?
1850 2018-08-01 19:37:52 The guy carry eyes go market oo

1853 2018-08-01 19:37:21 I use argon oil, and brush with a beard comb, that's about it
1854 2018-08-01 19:36:50 aww thank u  but i’ll look into that n try the coconut oil!!
1855 2018-08-01 19:36:47 Bro why’s your girl hitting me up too change her oil? You can do all that work too your truck but can’t change her oil  now she’s gotta take it too get done...... pathetic
1856 2018-08-01 19:36:42 Farsante !!
1857 2018-08-01 19:36:32 This means we have to oblige also Middle Eastern oil countries to pay their fair share of expences caused by meaningful measures. If they don’t want to there is always a possibility to use military power. #climatechange
1858 2018-08-01 19:36:27 Coconut oil works way faster I use that for everything that’s how my hair grew back
1859 2018-08-01 19:36:24 To make sure it lasts through that NYC humidity, commute + workday, and so you don't end up looking like a greaseball to see bae finish off with our Oil Control Primer Mist. The only catch is you won't break the bank.  (3/3)
1860 2018-08-01 19:36:17 I never stated that you didn't. I simply stated Barack Obama targeted coal plants because he's a weenie.

Liberal weenies don't want nuclear, gas, coal, oil.  They want sources of energy that can't meet demand.
1861 2018-08-01 19:36:07 A4 travel humidifier. It helps hydrate my skin in the dry hotel rooms. And a drop or two of Lavender essential oil in the water immediately calms me down.  #ExpediaAdvantage
1862 2018-08-01 19:35:50 Wanna feel personally attacked? Try getting an oil change (free with warranty) then getting told that your brakes are shot and they need to be fixed for $900 plus tax. BUT AT LEAST THE OIL CHANGE WAS FREE 
1863 2018-08-01 19:35:43 Coconut oil melts at 24C and solidifies again at 22C.

1870 2018-08-01 19:34:51 "As a member of the Regional Air Quality Council for nearly a decade, I can tell you that we won’t be able to meet the new standard without curbing growth in oil & gas emissions." How did you come into this position?

1883 2018-08-01 19:33:19 The Jeep dealership in CLT expects people to wait 1.5-2+ hours for a GD oil change. R u serious????
1884 2018-08-01 19:33:05 Rick it’s your fault!!  < my face legit looks like that... that shit was not tanning oil that was frying oil
1885 2018-08-01 19:33:02 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
1886 2018-08-01 19:32:58 Kate I only watched half that. 
Unbelievably I can make em from scratch & im a bloke  
You add the batter to smoking hot oil in the tray & get it back Int oven ASAP
1887 2018-08-01 19:32:57 I am in love with Jamaican Black Castor Oil for Dem’s hair
1888 2018-08-01 19:32:53 Omg are you kidding?  The only reason AB's had any growth is from oil price increases and still way behind growth in areas without a carbon tax.  If a carbon price is good, why did AUS and Germany scrap their's?
1889 2018-08-01 19:32:35 Where is the money  coming from to do this? We are not the Middle East we have no oil. It’s a stupid plan!
1890 2018-08-01 19:32:31 Could Massive Russian Oil Deal w/Exxon Explain Why Putin Appears Have Meddled US Election? -EXXON cheating again-caught in past ignoring sanctions- oil puts $ in Putin pocket to compromise our reps in USAhttps://www.democracynow.org/2016/12/12/could_massive_russian_oil_deal_with
1891 2018-08-01 19:32:23 The general consensus among my growers is that whatever they haven't sold will be held onto to offset lower early prices.  SB samples so far high N so feed only.  Rape not great, high oil so looking at an overall spread looking to regain losses by hanging on to excess.
1892 2018-08-01 19:32:21 I love truffle oil.
1893 2018-08-01 19:32:14 Pedicure. Scrub n massage and oil these feet that hold me up all day!
1894 2018-08-01 19:31:57 Big oil just like Trump are liars
1895 2018-08-01 19:31:53 Well obviously.
1896 2018-08-01 19:31:43 Yo @CNBCJou - is your show in half an hour? Finally got the kids to sleep and am about to track me some oil! Thanks
1897 2018-08-01 19:31:34 nice nuggets to get into here. Good to see this report has more detail, though bad to see - yet again, even from 3rd party - KRG oil reporting detail changing from report to report, even if it's going in the right direction. Also not great that it's no more current than the last.
1898 2018-08-01 19:31:32 Everyone knows Pecs > Principles
1899 2018-08-01 19:31:32 @PTIofficial i would like to highlight one concern of mine though. PAK embassy is located in Paris's most expensive area of Champs Elysee, from where alot of big companies have moved b/c of high rents. We r no oil rich country to waste money like that.
1900 2018-08-01 19:31:20 Lmfaoooo what !!!! Eveyoneeee was talking bout they wanna be tan before the trip and then I bring out the oil yall was like  
1901 2018-08-01 19:31:17 It sucks ass working in the oil feild when youre supposed to be on a 2 and 1 schedule but you end up working for 3 weeks and only get to stay home for 2 damn days....I'm tryna see my babies bruh
1902 2018-08-01 19:31:09 And John is judging the amount of times I've washed mine. Rose oil shampoo smells amazing!

1909 2018-08-01 19:30:29 i want an oil diffuser
1910 2018-08-01 19:30:24 Now I'm confused. You've already fried my brain. Is the toaster god or is there a transcendent god of the toaster? BTW, we pan fryers and friars have always been deep and otherwise together for a long time. Oil be awaiting ur reply. :-)
1911 2018-08-01 19:30:24 Now scheduling Essential Oil training!
1912 2018-08-01 19:30:18 ICYMI Boomers, #Norway is one of the #richest countries per person because they share their #oil wealth with the people, so they're not coming
1913 2018-08-01 19:30:16 getting an essential oil diffuser changed my life. I'm zen 89% of the time
1914 2018-08-01 19:30:08 As long as none of those products take money away from big oil
1915 2018-08-01 19:30:07 I need to know the hair oil you're using???
1916 2018-08-01 19:30:01 It is a possibility the use of peppermint oil lozenges could help with schizophrenia IMHO. It passes the Blood-Brain Barrier. Powerful combo could help. Researchers???
1917 2018-08-01 19:29:59 هههههههههههههههههه لا ياعم بضحك 
1918 2018-08-01 19:29:58 yep.. cars knock when theyre low on oil.. always start off by checking the oil level and upping it if necessary... if it knocks with a full amount of fresh oil then theres a larger issue.. as im sure you know
1919 2018-08-01 19:29:52 fuck the oil and gas industry
1920 2018-08-01 19:29:45 If you look even remotely like him without a shirt on, sure!
1921 2018-08-01 19:29:44 Islam only has power because the west allows it. The west is supporting islamists against secular leaders in the ME, opening borders for migrants and being dependent on arab oil.
1922 2018-08-01 19:29:43 They r good but you notice the oil hasnt been changed since bush was president. Little exxon valdez scent
1923 2018-08-01 19:29:30 Agreed. The Iranians' ability to block oil shipments would be eliminated within hours.
1924 2018-08-01 19:29:23 Energy return van onconventioneel  olie is vele malen lager dan conentional  oil  soms factor 5   . Teer zanden , fracking  ook of zelfs bij product van gas winning. Condensatie oil.
1925 2018-08-01 19:29:09 What all these clowns will never tell you is that 60% of England's (London's) Exports are to Scotland in the form of Financial Transactions with Edinburgh & Glasgow AND they can't afford to stop those transactions, just as they can't stop importing Power, Oil & Gas from Scotland.
1926 2018-08-01 19:28:55 Have you tried adding eggs and olive oil to his food?  Can really help with dry skin and coat
1927 2018-08-01 19:28:53 You need to get one that’s made for your type of skin. Not all face lotion is created the same. If you have oily skin, you need to have the ones that don’t come with oil. Keeps you moisturized without being oily. If you have dry skin then you get the ones made for dry skin etc
1928 2018-08-01 19:28:48 ugh, that will rattle the Oil Markets
1929 2018-08-01 19:28:48 THE SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION OF OUR COUNTRY FOR A NEW WORLD ORDER! PLEAS OPEN YOUR EYES! BUSH1 SAID IT! CARTER WAS A FILL IN TO HELP THEM ACCOMPLISH IT!

1932 2018-08-01 19:28:14 that's perfectly futile, unless you are  demonstrating the ability to defend the Iranian oil terminal in  Bandar Abbas from the combined wrath of everyone else in the gulf. let it be said in passing that probably the Izzies would itch, and I would not bet the Saudis would nix.
1933 2018-08-01 19:28:10 To me Cheney was Stromboli, to Bush's Pinochio (sic). Cheney on board of Halliburton, KBR. Tht cov. Oil fields, and housing, food for,Iraq,
1934 2018-08-01 19:28:01 Some great options but I think you need to get naked, so either the oil or the bath!

1937 2018-08-01 19:27:39 My doggo was like that. I put a capsule of evening primrose oil in her dinner and give her a spoonful of natural yoghurt for breakfast to help with natural flora and all that .
1938 2018-08-01 19:27:33 went pet sitting, then went on a fun lil adventure to map out our weekend plans, then ended up at this vegan cafe to get a smoothie, + also but some tea tree oil  nice day
1939 2018-08-01 19:27:29 The usability of InfoChip spans many industries, including oil & gas and construction, providing asset tracking capability anywhere.
1940 2018-08-01 19:27:20 If you are dating online, wear Jezebel oil to repel scrubs. Light white protection candles. Keep protection stones with you. Share your location with friends. Use discernment. If something feels off, it is.
1941 2018-08-01 19:27:12 $ATH.TO earnings in ~40 minutes. Discussions on Twitter have shown me that these earnings may not be as awesome as I had hoped. Still think it's a great buy, and still holding, but probably more of a long term play. 
Canadian oil companies are criminally underowned right now.
1942 2018-08-01 19:27:01 That was big oil kissing government asses. Have to play along you know, also they pass on the cost.
1943 2018-08-01 19:26:51 ก็ตอบเเบบมีมารยาทไง!! ทำไมชอบให้รวั้ยรว้าย
1944 2018-08-01 19:26:49 Seriously, just read a little history, specifically economics and in particular the USD in relation to gold, read up on macroeconomics vs micro, especially in relation to China and Russia.  Read up on the history of oil Standard Oil thru Opec.  Then read up on grammar (for me).
1945 2018-08-01 19:26:30 Your America first will turn inti America alone, always. No more help when you start unnecessary wats or regime change. No oil, water electricity. #buildnorthernwall
1946 2018-08-01 19:26:26 as you imply, some people find it in their political interest to wish these good growth figures, including in the oil and gas sectors, were worse. finding blame for a business cycle or change in international oil prices has gotten out of hand
1947 2018-08-01 19:26:24 When the oil starts to sizzle out of the pan.
1948 2018-08-01 19:26:18 Pergunto: a vereadora ganhou 1 milhão de santinhos do picareta do Doria.
1949 2018-08-01 19:25:56 Dude - just give up. You can still make plenty of money peddling your snake oil to the willfully ignorant. No need to keep getting owned by someone with a knowledge of history.
1950 2018-08-01 19:25:35 Bit of oil might sort that big chap!
1951 2018-08-01 19:25:18 Remember all those oil spills?
1952 2018-08-01 19:25:13 don’t forget…  the main ingredient of their beard oil is bacon grease!
1953 2018-08-01 19:25:12 What people consider as  common-sense claims listed here are of no use in rational thinking. Tankers making noise? Whales short of salmon stock? Oilsand fields containing a flourishing flora being ruined by oil production? I don't call these "proved". Bad defence won't help.
1954 2018-08-01 19:25:09 انت السبب هههههههههههههههههه
1955 2018-08-01 19:25:06 That sounds great but I'm looking for crunchy roasted ones. Everyone has tricks to make them crunchy (dry with a towel, peel, roast with no oil first, let cool in pan) and in my experience they seldom work.
1956 2018-08-01 19:25:03 A3: #makershour One of my favourites was a mobile I made for a friend's son with a Noah's ark theme. Each pair of animals was made from the corresponding type of wood (leopard wood, zebra wood, etc.), finished in linseed oil.
1957 2018-08-01 19:24:55 The jiffy lube I get my oil changes done at has a bad ass woman who works there. 
1958 2018-08-01 19:24:53 Putting some Palestinian olive oil on my ravioli as a tribute to the great Southern European haplogroups
1959 2018-08-01 19:24:47 I have so much stress that I started tearing up when I was getting an oil change. Lmfaooo
1960 2018-08-01 19:24:44 I believe EIA may be dreaming up these higher outputs to keep the price of oil low.  Wouldn’t put it past Trump to be colliding/directing EIA!!!!
1961 2018-08-01 19:24:39 Unfortunately for them oil company executives share the same planet as the rest of us.
1962 2018-08-01 19:24:18 Nothing feels as good as a fresh bip, shower, face mask, then oil treatment. Lawd hah merthy.
1963 2018-08-01 19:24:05 Tuna Oil Triggered
1964 2018-08-01 19:23:44 I heard adding coconut oil is good too
Haven’t tried it tho
1965 2018-08-01 19:23:30 Allergic kids in elem school get protected, often controversially. Yet once they're in high school (Gr 8/9), with cafs, Asian students bringing leftovers cooked in peanut oil, others with PB & J sandwiches, they somehow have to learn to cope on their own. No one polices them.
1966 2018-08-01 19:23:18 'The best way to 'eat' South Sudan is to achieve peace so that those with hoes would sell their produce to those who will pocket oil money.'

1967 2018-08-01 19:23:13 Nobody invaded them in the name of god.

I also dont believe the crazy theory that america invaded purely on the purpose of stealing oil.
1968 2018-08-01 19:23:05 How do we stop black sooth in Rivers State when security operatives continue to burn ceased crude oil laden vessel?...
1969 2018-08-01 19:22:59 partying and oil spray lick hit hit hit hit hit graaw flash
1970 2018-08-01 19:22:49 If their true intent was to retain exclusivity, then they should've limited production to meet actual demand.  They are displaying poor judgement in many areas. Just be glad they're not involved in oil production..
1971 2018-08-01 19:22:49 This is a great way to raise the price of oil, but, long-term, Iran couldn't block the strait.
1972 2018-08-01 19:22:48 Fish oil pills are a waste of money tbh
1973 2018-08-01 19:22:32 If you think your life sucks just think...someone let their 2012 Hyundai Sonata run out of oil and their engine is now trash. Wasn’t me tho
1974 2018-08-01 19:22:28 يااااااااارب
1975 2018-08-01 19:22:26 The discussion is not over, PDP are known all around the world as looters, thieves, con men, embezzlers, chronic liars. For 16 years they rule Nigeria, they looted and dry up the treasury. $500 billion oil funds was looted by PDP. You are all crooks. Don't just say anything.
1976 2018-08-01 19:21:53 Like the reporting on GOP not funding election security? Leaving out one " minor" detail. Over 300 million available right now, unspent. 
Is it true? Who the hell knows.
1977 2018-08-01 19:21:32 Literally got an oil change before I left to Texas. I put on 4,000 miles in a month. Dasssss crazyyyyy.
1978 2018-08-01 19:21:28 When it hits me I’m screaming no. But it’s like having weights on your ankles, pulling you underwater. It’s like you being coated in oil and falling own a slippery slide, not able to grip onto anything to slow it down Nor stop the descend into darkness
1979 2018-08-01 19:21:14 did you also apply for oil production? 
does hempmed own any production facilities for hemp?

1982 2018-08-01 19:20:44 Gee, I guess you shouldn't have voted for Scott Pruitt as administrator. Everybody knew he was as corrupt as they come and was in the pockets of Big Oil. Little buyer's regret there, Senator? Elections and votes have consequences.
1983 2018-08-01 19:20:31 NOM NOM! will have to try that butter, we did coconut oil, which was great, but does make the popcorn sweeter. How about protein shakes/powders? @DanielRensch has been wondering
1984 2018-08-01 19:20:24 When I make bolognese I follow a recipe I got from an Italian "momma" years ago. It's called a mirepoix which is used as a base flavour. Sauté them in butter +/- olive oil with rosemary and thyme & garlic. I use a small bit of celery
1985 2018-08-01 19:20:23 Yesss! The powder will prevent u from sweating and any moisture. Baby oil just make ya skin soft lol

1988 2018-08-01 19:20:06 #ableg #abed Do you agree with the  estimate that the world will run out of oil and gas in 150 years?
1989 2018-08-01 19:19:54 @DeptofDefense In reality, the military is 95% good people, and you would share.  My point is...try a little more sharing right now.  We now produce the most oil in world...so relax and let the poorer countries win some.  Don't be selfish like leaders of Saudi Arabia.

1994 2018-08-01 19:19:34 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
1995 2018-08-01 19:19:13 I use cbd oil, it works! That angry flaring feeling inside my chest no longer happens! I don't have to work so hard to fight all these negative emotions because they are no longer there!
1996 2018-08-01 19:19:12 All helping our economy. Reducing imported oil.

2001 2018-08-01 19:18:46 which tan oil does he use because I need it 
2002 2018-08-01 19:18:40 But yes, they are horrific. I personally know several people, mostly elderly people, who were tortured with hot irons, boiling water and oil, candles, saws, screwdrivers, garden tools. Come on, man. Look at the facts not the narrative.
2003 2018-08-01 19:18:36 Let's punish that boy now
2004 2018-08-01 19:18:28 This is not a fair parallel. Russia's foreign account was hit far harder by the falling oil price in H2 2014 than by sanctions.
2005 2018-08-01 19:18:25 Public service is not bloated, as Mr Harper found. 

Our society was built on coal and oil, but that era is ending. Climate change alone overrides benefits of oil. 

 Renewables provide a large net benefits with reduced negative externalities.
2006 2018-08-01 19:18:14 What does that have to do with the practice of oil pulling?
2007 2018-08-01 19:18:09 That feeling when you bought:
* pair of jeans
* oil pan
* shampoo
* nail polish
and fell 100500 spots on Forbes list :D
2008 2018-08-01 19:17:46 Cbd oil and lavender. Or come over with the babes and hang out with levi and I amd we can have girl chat. 
2009 2018-08-01 19:17:46 Didn't a developer pull out of a food & drink park not far from kingsford blaming downturn in oil& gas??
2010 2018-08-01 19:17:41 What you eat, sleep patterns, and even genetics all play into your potential length and grown speed. A moisture regimen and keeping split ends off will help and also low manipulation styling (to minimize split ends and breakage from combing/detangling) for most people coconut oil
2011 2018-08-01 19:17:40 I wish you in the UK good luck on your *good fight*... it’s time to get things back the way they should be there. We are working on that one here in the USA against the same snake oil salesmen that tried the same shell game on us.

2017 2018-08-01 19:17:20 May lugar sa langit yung mga taong gumagamit ng efficascent oil, white flower or vicks sa mga public transpo. Sarap sa feeling makaamoy after a long tired day from work or even sa pagod sa biyahe.

2029 2018-08-01 19:15:32 Tried, but they drove me nuts. Oil and massage daily helped a lot though
2030 2018-08-01 19:15:29 I remember those early headlines. They caused quite a scare until debunked. Ever since then I’ve been highly sceptical of any claims oil is about to run out.
2031 2018-08-01 19:15:26 You're gonna need more Gun Oil for that gang bang.
2032 2018-08-01 19:15:24 Meanwhile, BiBi needs to stop threatening War with Iran in Red Sea over Oil Supplies from Saudis & Emirates. Houthi of Yemen are proud independent People who will decide for themselves whether to block Red Sea or not. @netanyahu needs to tell Saudis to #STOPTerrorizingYemen

2034 2018-08-01 19:15:10 How did I ever get oil changes with the kids in the car before I had a DVD player?
2035 2018-08-01 19:15:09 I would drink olive oil if I could.
2036 2018-08-01 19:15:06 This puts a real dent in the meritless lawsuits against the oil industry. The politicians at all levels have promoted and realized the benefits of an economy (that still is) rooted in energy production. Technologies to free us from dependancy on fossil fuels are still inadequate.
2037 2018-08-01 19:15:02 My name ain’t rich tho fam and I don’t get a conventional oil change. Synthetic oil only how much is that?
2038 2018-08-01 19:14:58 If you’re having trouble with mood, I recommend vitamin D, vitamin B12, and Fish Oil
2039 2018-08-01 19:14:50 Man was enjoying shinkafan gidan gwamnati,till it got into his brain and made him vomit on the Plate he  has eaten from,forgetting you don't bite the fingers that fed you.

2042 2018-08-01 19:14:45 ...just mount giant flamethrowers on the front of every oil tanker and stomp on the gas goin' through the straight...
2043 2018-08-01 19:14:44 Tell PMB we are waiting for him in 2019 in South West, he will reap what he sowed, just tell him that.
This is what Obasanjo & co call failure? The Otta road & dilapilated Lagos-Ibadan road OBJ handed over in 2007 after one of Nigeria's biggest oil boom is a success?
2044 2018-08-01 19:14:30 Hydrocarbon rich Kazakhstan is totally dependent on Russian export routes to sell its oil and gas and they provide more than 90% of government revenue.

Hard to be truly independent when Putin holds your nuts.

The rest is window dressing.
2045 2018-08-01 19:14:29 You can be pro-woman without thinking women have immunity when they say something stupid
2046 2018-08-01 19:14:22 Have you tried rose or lavender oil? Helps soothe the lady pains. 
2047 2018-08-01 19:14:16 Good beat title: Oil Kartz
2048 2018-08-01 19:14:15 I disagree. He has a criminal mindset, though cunning it is not! He has loads of experience as a snake oil salesman & a shitload of $ he did not earn & a bunch of ugly kids made differently ugly by plastic surgery, who are self indulgent pigs, & he always has McDonalds.
2049 2018-08-01 19:13:59 Creo que algo más, si analizamos que las obras inconclusas de Báez se las dieron a Cristobal López antes de que salte lo de OIL y que Macri vía DNU le actualizó 45.000 millones al Soterramiento, cuando ya se sabía todo de Odebrecht, ambas cosas sucedieron en 2016, un año más...
2050 2018-08-01 19:13:53 بعد ايه بعد ايه هههههههههههههههههه
2051 2018-08-01 19:13:38 we’re getting my moms oil changed and there’s a guy just casually checking out my moms car and humming mario. this isn’t relevant but I felt like it deserved a tweet.
2052 2018-08-01 19:13:31 Look at all the Democrat sex predators & how the Democrats, Hollywood, & the Fake News Media always protect them. Dems don’t care about women. They care about dividing America, & creating hysteria to win votes using scare tactics.
2053 2018-08-01 19:13:22 Interesting chart but surely just using GDP is a little flawed? For example Norway may produce more expensive products like oil and then have to charge higher cost to offset the higher salaries that need to be paid due to the very high taxes levied on the workers.
2054 2018-08-01 19:13:11 You put the coconut oil castor oil in a sprotz bottle add water as well n spray on scalp everyday
2055 2018-08-01 19:13:01 LOL Crazy to think a little bottle of OIL could stir things up so much lol

2056 2018-08-01 19:12:52 Very scary what will be when Israel acquires all their oil fields. This monetary power they will achieve can only manifest into even more criminal activities.

2060 2018-08-01 19:12:38 Will you be demanding namee changes for baby oil, milk of magnesia, and lady fingers?
2061 2018-08-01 19:12:31 You've proven to be utterly devoid of any logic or substantive knowledge so this is a waste of my time. Try not to use broad characterization as backed by nothing at all. On that note, I'm muting you
2062 2018-08-01 19:12:26 If you ever want a good laugh, go with @_chaandler_ to get her oil changed. She’s a real hoot 
2063 2018-08-01 19:12:26 Big oil companies really suck. They would rather see the world end than to give clean energy. I hope you can make a difference in MA that's where I'm from so I'd like to see my home tome get upgraded with solar energy

2068 2018-08-01 19:11:57 All that Castor Oil went in vain 
2069 2018-08-01 19:11:40 Oil pipelines are the gold standard of don't do it. The gold standard in "how did we get trapped in this can't win game of lose and lose." The gold standard in bait and switch "looks like prosperity but we're deeper in debt and sicker than dogs."
2070 2018-08-01 19:11:39 I just went to walmart and got the 19.99 one that has a color-changing LED light and put 2 drops of lavender oil in it! She doesn’t wake up AT ALL anymore! I dont let it run all night though, i let it run while im rocking her until i put her in the crib just so it fills the room

2075 2018-08-01 19:11:09 The orange stain is having truckloads of oil dumped in the Cleveland river, so everyone can watch the river burn nostalgically like it did BEFORE the EPA.
2076 2018-08-01 19:11:08 I spent a summer making kettle corn by hand at a fairground.  I had to wear long sleeves in the middle of August because the hot oil would spit scalding kernels onto my arms.  My friends started calling me “Track Marks” from the welts and scars.

2083 2018-08-01 19:10:43 Would never even try. Oregano oil is more concentrated though. It tastes like pure evil and death .
2084 2018-08-01 19:10:24 Thats not socialism. That’s U.S. and other oil hungry counties interfering and paying off officials that should be protecting their people. Instead, on the take because other countries have PROVEN it works.
2085 2018-08-01 19:10:08 It’s okay. Honestly the oil is only bad for you if you are also consuming carbs/sugar. I’d be happy to explain the process to you if you’re interested in learning. I understand it’s hard to wrap your head around at first because it is literally the opposite of what we were taught

2091 2018-08-01 19:09:34 Try lime juice and grated ginger for an acidic component to balance out the salt and oil factor (vinegar in lieu of lime is also good depending on your tastes but only a dash)

Also you could try honey instead of b sugar so it works as a thickening agent too

2205 2018-08-01 18:53:52 No, the American farmer does not.  Yes, snarl at @POTUS over his sanction determination on #Iran @SecPompeo they need to think long and hard over handing over a country to #Italy for oil
2206 2018-08-01 18:53:39 Not suffering at all son loyal supporter unlike you. You only start supporting city when the oil money came in hence your obsession with LIVERPOOL FC.

2209 2018-08-01 18:53:17 Nope, Neem oil kills male fertility. Seriously, is there a toothstick that doesn't screw up men?

How did this ancient guys clean their teeth?
2210 2018-08-01 18:53:15 When one gets blocked by an account dedicated to the movement of oil tankers, they need to take a look in the mirror and reconsider life choices
2211 2018-08-01 18:53:09 When a tanker spills, which is inevitable with a sevenfold increase in tanker traffic, it will be carrying the world’s most toxic oil—bitumen. It's only possible to recover 10% to 15% of the oil from the ocean. This leaves 85% to 90% of the oil to devastate and kill wildlife.

2213 2018-08-01 18:53:02 Article in local paper from @AP says WH states reason for rolling back better fuel standards is because with better mpg, more people will drive and at more exposure to risk as result.
Omfg, really?? Let's call it what it is, oil industry bullshit.
2214 2018-08-01 18:52:49 MY WORK MOM JUST ASKED ME WHERE TO GET CBD OIL AND I ALMOST SPIT WATER ACROSS THE ROOM
2215 2018-08-01 18:52:47 Venezuela has oil we have turkish hammam.
2216 2018-08-01 18:52:44 Especially women in my region. South South region of Nigeria. Oil spillage and gas flaring and all manner of chemical pollutions destroying these women's source of livelihood which is fishing and agriculture. I intend to do a great research on this soon
2217 2018-08-01 18:52:40 word around the office is you’ve got a fat cock

I prototype downhole tools for oil and gas with one.
Let me tell you.  If your printer is not calibrated, your tolerances are... well... you dont even have tolerences it is so bad.
Guns?  They need pretty tight tolerences!

2227 2018-08-01 18:52:04 Look at airplane manufacturing / #'s, the machine shops around Chicago are busy. He works with caterpillar,  kamatsu, oil states industries, automotive, .gov engineering etc he's passing on every dime of input cost
2228 2018-08-01 18:51:45 Your crazy uncle and your cooking oil did some talking; we would like u to take up some DNA coding, pls.  He feels both his and your Soul Fu'd is incomplete without far-eastern ingredients.  IDK, I'm just trying to translate his boiling bubbles.
2229 2018-08-01 18:51:44 @neiLLanthony chill with the olive oil tho
2230 2018-08-01 18:51:43 Me:*does an oil change*
Them: so we did an inspection and here’s what you have to fix
Me: lol lemme call my dad real quick
2231 2018-08-01 18:51:34 I realized that no one has ever said "watched meat doesnt cook" (watched water doesnt boil inspired) so I decided to fry some chicken in a pan and I got down low to see the pink on the middle and oil popped into my eye so I guess theres a reason no one cared to experiment
2232 2018-08-01 18:51:18 Anymore I automatically assume the opposite is true of anything reported. More often than not this turns out to be the case.
2233 2018-08-01 18:51:16 It's okay, an oil spill will take care of that soon enough!
2234 2018-08-01 18:51:10 Indeed. Getting rid of coal was "easy" but getting rid of oil and gas is another order harder. Bring it on
2235 2018-08-01 18:50:57 Worldwide demand goes up along with prices because of peak oil. Smart countries sidestep the issue by accelerating EV adoption and solar
2236 2018-08-01 18:50:53 Anyone know how to get some olive oil and balsamic vin out of a shirt? help
2237 2018-08-01 18:50:41 There is absolutely no need for you to put on a shirt.
2238 2018-08-01 18:50:33 I do both. Coconut oil and creamer. I rather like it. My dental hygienist suggested it.

2249 2018-08-01 18:49:30 @Allure_magazine ‘s beauty box slogan should just be “enjoy your trial size because you won’t be able to afford the full size.” How dare you get me hooked on Luna’s 100$ sleeping oil.

2253 2018-08-01 18:49:13 I can't love your responses enough! Also, part of it is the different kinds of resources, so many places may have oil, but not much access to fresh water... But the groundwork to be able to raid other countries for what the west needs has been laid for thousands of years.
2254 2018-08-01 18:49:13 So agree!  Love @RandyBJohns SCT oil and part of their patients' success!

2258 2018-08-01 18:48:55 I'm not sure of the measurements, add the spirit, glycerine & tissue oil to the Nivea. Mix together but don't make it to watery.

2263 2018-08-01 18:48:26 Also corn tortillas make good quesadillas bc they're less sticky so you can just cook them w/o oil which is way nicer to clean up

2266 2018-08-01 18:47:52 Try coconut oil and vitamin E oil they’re 
2267 2018-08-01 18:47:49 Hi. I’ve been suffering from scalp psoriasis for 17 years now and one of the thing to control is by using virgin coconut oil on your scalp then shampoo as usual. Also I use cocomess shampoo from mysmink and it work wonder.

2280 2018-08-01 18:46:25 Sea salt works wonderful too. Hot shower, liquid soap, add some sea salt, you can add essential oil, your favorite, use it as a scrub. I usually do both when I feel bad energy in a place/person. Mediation helps keep your vibes higher so you absorb the bad ones less.

2287 2018-08-01 18:45:40 Of course that’s a possibility. Texas has been red for a long time. However, Beto is running on a platform of No PAC/No Big Business contributions. Cruz is doing quite the opposite and Texans are tired of their votes being used to make the likes of gas & oil tycoons richer.

2301 2018-08-01 18:44:19 Just so everyone gets this clear. Higher oil selling price differential doesn't necessarily translate into a surplus. There r deficits, debt repayments, expanding current account and capital expenditures. While oil price is high, it doesn't mean more money.

2307 2018-08-01 18:43:01 What an amazing piece of journalism.
I have to wonder at how Americans are able to criticize themselves to this extent and take responsibility. In paper. 
In reality, I wonder at how they and their greed have managed to ruin the Earth.
2308 2018-08-01 18:42:58 Misleading title, as this is more about mitiginating bacteria in an industrial environment. i.e., using oil on machines sort of like you’d season a pan.

But in an industrial operation like that, I’d easily use ozonation daily. Will probably work with the oil, too.
2309 2018-08-01 18:42:29 I remember being slightly shocked (but not shocked, I tell you, shocked) learning some of the minor retouching techniques they used all the time on their film photography, like mineral oil scratch filling, etc.

2322 2018-08-01 18:41:13 That's how Trudeau likes it. Doesn't matter how many cook ups like Lac Megantic happen it doesn't lose him Quebec votes. Any talk of a much safer pipeline thru Quebec does lose him votes so no energy east. Eastern refineries must depend on Saudi Arabia,Nigerian Venezuelan oil.

Oceans as stores of human forced warmth from our use of oil & coal & with ability to release that heat back to atmosphere needs more study in my view. But it's a specialisation at moment rather than Climate 101

2335 2018-08-01 18:39:28 She told me I should go change my shirt so that I wouldn’t get oil on it while cooking. I said I didn’t care about it lol But it’s fine because she went on a 2 hour rant on why I’ve been a piece of shit child lately lol
2336 2018-08-01 18:39:17 in case anyone was wondering, it appears i am *very* allergic to peppermint essential oil
2337 2018-08-01 18:39:11 imo, it's realism, not courage. i don't know what's worse, a bunch of cowards that can't put oil out of business because of fear of a few blackouts, or people lying to themselves that oil companies are redeemable.
2338 2018-08-01 18:39:10 Not wanting a pipeline means giving up all goods? Yes, they're made with oil but those who become less reliant on oil will fare better in the long term.

Tarsands: terribly toxic to the environment.

Most intelligent thing you said? Grow your own food 100%. The rest is rubbish.
2339 2018-08-01 18:39:06 Ah yes, well, this is a great way of disposing of spoiled food. Feed to chickens with chilli powder and oil for chicken flu, intestinal parasites, egg bound fowl. It actually works. Yes, yr mum must have some great stories - maggots in lard, etc!
2340 2018-08-01 18:39:02 Awh thank you. It was taken on our little holiday we went on together a couple of weeks ago when she took me to a lavander field because she knows I have an emotional attatchment to lavender (I have bad anxiety but I use lavander oil to sleep/in panic attacks etc and it soothes)

2346 2018-08-01 18:38:12 there is no r oil when u look at establishment politics.  they both want the same thing, OPEN BORDERS!!.  They both want to become bigger billionaires on the backs of US citizens
2347 2018-08-01 18:38:07 kasama sa skin care routine ko yung efficascent relaxing oil
2348 2018-08-01 18:37:51 No, even that busted up one slid up and down no problem, On the B engine, they are oiled by the oil draining back to the sump, hence the comp ones are drilled to help lubricate and also drain rather than fill to reduce valve train weight. There's no issue with the head oil supply
2349 2018-08-01 18:37:50 ...great ...and the second should be to deregulate the environmental stranglehold on oil and pipelines - send the BC radicals packing!

2354 2018-08-01 18:37:25 Abit of Olive Oil or tenderizer will do the trick! Do you have any thyme?
2355 2018-08-01 18:37:10 What's funny is Kim Gargoyle used to date Gavin Newsome, so politics are not a deal breaker with her as long as you have at least a quart of oil in your hair.
2356 2018-08-01 18:36:49 -use castor oil for enhanced facial hair like mustache or even your eyebrows. 
-workout 3-4 times a week to build your muscles. 
-drink more water you can never get enough water. 
-be confident don’t take nothing from nobody.

2365 2018-08-01 18:35:47 So are you burning midnight oil or are you just rocking it out early in the morning?

2367 2018-08-01 18:35:18 "Friendship and money". Oil and water.
2368 2018-08-01 18:34:59 You stand in a wallpapered room, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a nightstand.
2369 2018-08-01 18:34:58 You' are the only one strained because the truth about you is going to come out. The only people supporting are the ones to stupid to understand you are a snake oil salesman and liar. The vast majority of this Nation is eager for your takedown. Shouldn't be long.

2373 2018-08-01 18:34:31 One of the great problems with America is that it’s cultural acceptable and the default move to mix mayo with tuna. Should be only be eaten w olive oil.
2374 2018-08-01 18:34:12 What’s the downside to using pump oil as a temporary heating bath (65 C) for my reaction after realizing we don’t have any silicone oil?
2375 2018-08-01 18:34:00 334

2382 2018-08-01 18:33:42 @BuddysAlignment Hello! We are just reaching out to our neighbors by Scottsdale Airpark! I'm sure some of our employees will be stopping by for an oil change at some point with prices as amazing as yours!! Let us know if we can do anything for you! =) Cheers!

2386 2018-08-01 18:33:13 Tonight the nation is going to sleep wondering what the so called protectors of our constitution are plotting for us tonight. Perhaps we dream that they will be burning midnight oil trying to make South Africa a better and safer place for all. I suppose we can dream anything

2389 2018-08-01 18:32:47  "We have high hopes of getting them back," he said
 She said a prayer and applied blessin' oil on my head
2390 2018-08-01 18:32:37 Got to love it. Need my oil change but you keep telling me not to take it in. But yet you come up with 101 reasons why you can't do it.
2391 2018-08-01 18:32:26 It costs about $50 to produce oil in mideast. Any price above $50 is caused by trading desks bidding up supply to buyers. Big Oil is dominated by STATE owned oil co's. 30% State owned vs 13% public co's.
2392 2018-08-01 18:32:25 It ended up well, and it's the same thing w/ what Ian did: water, oil, coloring, and an effervescent tablet
2393 2018-08-01 18:32:25 Fantastic! I cleaned my fryer earlier on, I just cannot believe how little accumulation of gunge there now is. With veg oil I had to scrape the emulsion film off the elements regularly. The fishplate now is shiny. Boiling water only to clean @RLMProvisions
2394 2018-08-01 18:32:19 Do you also rely on only domestic dairy to produce facial cream, and only the finest domestic fracking operation to produce vegetable oil?
2395 2018-08-01 18:32:05 Frying fish in oil? That's fish oil
2396 2018-08-01 18:32:04 You get more oil from us than you do Saudi Arabia and we can suspend you patents as well so we have options. Yeah you are the largest economy no shit you could crush us but why would you want to? Will the US be better off with Canada in a recession? No.
2397 2018-08-01 18:31:59 I have some partially decarbed infused coconut oil that's a good friend of mine. 

I'd make a smoothie with raw flower for that THCa, its awesome for quelling digestive pain. Crohns has been giving me issues.
2398 2018-08-01 18:31:48 Gua pake kleveru cuman dipijet alus karna cuman buat ngelembabin kulit yg iritasi sih :( baru tau bisa gitu. Itu pake varian oil apa? Gua cuman punya ricebran sama avocado oil aja, bisa ga ya kek lu gitu nder?
2399 2018-08-01 18:31:45 For a country that is supposedly now owned by Russia, it's amazing how little has changed, isn't it? When do the RU Oligarchs start taking over Big Oil and Pharma?

2404 2018-08-01 18:31:34 old people have gears in their legs that have to be oiled so they oil them up and then have to go walk so it’s distributed properly

2413 2018-08-01 18:30:27 You have a narrow perspective. Why do you believe every single person must be categorized as the left or as a conservative? That's pretty sad you can't use your brain in more expansive ways.
2414 2018-08-01 18:30:13 As a kid, I went to a frontier festival and purchased snake oil from a performing Salesman named Dakota Dan.  It was black tea.  Oh the irony of being duped into buying fake snake oil!

2417 2018-08-01 18:29:37 FACE & BODY 

-find a skin care routine that works FOR YOU! 
-use a face mask once a week
-moisturize your body
-keep your brows on fleek 
-apply tea tree oil to pimples to minimize the size 
-use a lip scrub
-shave (if you don’t shave that’s okay !!)
2418 2018-08-01 18:29:35 Does it seem like the followers were sticking, then getting hammered by the cam lobes? Maybe an oil flow problem?

2424 2018-08-01 18:29:03 So... you guys expect me to believe it is *conservatives* who are attacking Natalie and calling her names because she said that the media is driving her into Trump's arms? That's your "logical" conclusion?
2425 2018-08-01 18:29:01 I’ll qualify this: they are ACTIVELY using anti-science snake oil to generalise “cures” for real issues/maladies. It’s the height of irresponsibility. Next they’ll be advocating chelation therapy for anxiety, all the while belittling “vegan snowflakes” with gluten intolerance.
2426 2018-08-01 18:28:54 A hose snapped when i was changing my oil

2428 2018-08-01 18:28:44 Yes it is...
2429 2018-08-01 18:28:32 excuse i think it’s very rude that i have to pay $73 to get my oil changed
2430 2018-08-01 18:27:56 Morning Joe is a deep state stooge and a spineless pussy. The man has no self awareness and no soul. They deplatform Alex and then attack him, knowing he can’t fight back. You F-ing lowlife. At least when I went after anti-Jew Alex and his snake oil empire, I did it fairly.
2431 2018-08-01 18:27:54 I should have learned my lesson with Big O Tires the other day when I came to get my oil changed. That took 2 hours but my oil change was free. Now I'm back here getting 4 tires and an alignment. But for the last hour or so, my Jeep is on the lift but no work is being done.

2434 2018-08-01 18:27:20 Eeek! Don’t vape regular coconut oil. The lipids in the oil can cause a dangerous form of pneumonia if they get inhaled. It’s excellent for eating and topicals but not ideal for vaping.
2435 2018-08-01 18:27:16 Después de ver una vez más el anuncio de @mcdonaldscr del Big Mac "con bacon", voy a ir al súper a comprar un kilo de ribs, un litro de oil y un poco de BBQ para el Lunch de hoy...
2436 2018-08-01 18:27:11 Interesting that the moment China abandons #USD trade in oil and starts trading yuan #CL futures, the USA pushes for a major trade war with anyone involved in that trade #NWO
2437 2018-08-01 18:27:02 UBI is defined by the universal receipt of income, not the source of the income. You're basically saying that you love the idea of UBI as long as it's funded by something like oil wealth, which it absolutely can be. Funding for UBI has infinite possibilities. Pick your favorite.
2438 2018-08-01 18:26:54 i love waiting for oil changesss  cant you fucking tell
2439 2018-08-01 18:26:46 Oil built this town and sprawl doesn’t bother me. Btw, I live in a high rise in DT Houston and use the light-rail more than 99.9% of most City residents. Always heavily armed because it is dangerous. I know this because of crime statistics and my wife’s work at the DA’s office.
2440 2018-08-01 18:26:40 Realized I never asked your take on France's rapid nuclear transition, driven by profound economic/strategic risk seen in reliance on imported oil for nearly all electricity. Was wondering about that in context of current arguments that we need a war footing on decarbonization.

2444 2018-08-01 18:26:01 and thats when i learned cooking with very hot, bubbling oil is best done in clothes. who knew
2445 2018-08-01 18:25:49 Women never go get they oil changed smh. They be hundreds of miles over and don’t even care
2446 2018-08-01 18:25:36 Coconut oil and neosporin is prob a good combination.
2447 2018-08-01 18:25:35 How much oil is used in creating these motors...
2448 2018-08-01 18:25:07 Too much vinegar, prefer chopped chili in oil
2449 2018-08-01 18:24:51 I'm in Grangemouth, the place where plastic and oil come from. It's pretty poor. Almost like the money doesn't trickle down. I'm having to think at times, if worst comes to worst and I die from lack of meds. At least I have insurance money that might save them.
2450 2018-08-01 18:24:47 its annoying how easily my curls soaks up any oil or cream i put in it like damn wtf why my crown feel like synthetic hair day after wash day 
2451 2018-08-01 18:24:45 Damnit! This clip should not be seen by yourself when you're at Walmart doing an oil change! The intensity of this movie was already epic and I could barely wrap my mind around it.

2457 2018-08-01 18:23:55 We do not want toxic chemical- laden American meat, palm oil, corn syrup, or any of that crap polluting our food supply. We will boycott every last American thing that comes over here.
2458 2018-08-01 18:23:52 No, she is representing the people of America when she stands there and lie. She is not an info commercial actress. Sorry you’re (not your) not willing or capable of understanding the distinction.
2459 2018-08-01 18:23:33 Olive oil in the tray, six sliced tomatoes, one sliced red onion, 400g sliced potatoes, 3 cloves of garlic, dried mix herbs, seasoning then a carton of passata. 45 minutes at 180c stir then another 45 minutes.
2460 2018-08-01 18:23:28 This is a LIE.  Wtf are you thinking?  You are playing God with this.  We can't mess with the ecosystem and just pretend everything is fine, just so people make big $$$ from oil!! People and animals - life on EARTH  - is already suffering.

2473 2018-08-01 18:21:29 They should have been, and we use high quality race oil. In the old engine that cam did fine on more standard spec followers that had no wear which is why we were happy to use it in the new engine but with the new light weight, drilled followers.
2474 2018-08-01 18:21:25 It was  Chili oil that used a revolver to break the marble
2475 2018-08-01 18:21:21 Another Slush fund source for Universal Basic Income. Pull from Mega Corp subsidies. Did you know oil corps receive over $4B of our tax money per year? Why? Are we not in a free market? Why are we giving billionaires more billions of our tax dollars?

Exfoliate your lips with a lip scrub or sugar with coconut oil

- cinnamon and Vaseline and coconut oil
^^^crush the cinnamon and apply to the Vaseline and coconut oil
2478 2018-08-01 18:21:06 I adore you. : )   Coconut oil coconut milk, fresh ginger, lemon pepper & juice, garlic, lemongrass and bamboo shoots. Ahhhh....the fruit sounds refreshing and bet baby's milk will be delicious too. Yay!
2479 2018-08-01 18:20:58 Has there ever been an analysis done on the total value of ALL goods, services and taxes taken out of Scotland by the UK govt./pa Oil, Gas, Whisky, electricity etc? Just how much are we worth to the UK? Surely the UK is keeping accurate and comprehensive records. Are SNP?

2484 2018-08-01 18:20:37 Free stuff someone throwing away down fairview in the alley behind Decatur street in new chicago. There's a bunch of gardening pots a couple patio umbrellas, bamboo oil lamps without the lanterns, lawn edging and some other stuff.
2485 2018-08-01 18:20:15 Go to Mr. Lube for an innocent oil change and next thing you know there’s two guys making love to your exhaust pipe screaming “CROSS CHECK ON BAY 3”
2486 2018-08-01 18:19:59 Now you’re reading my mind?! I seriously doubt that you’re that smart.
And what on earth are you talking about?! US sanctions are about buying oil from Iran, what does this have to do with immigration?! Some of you guys are unbelievably “not bright”.

2487 2018-08-01 18:19:58 erdogan is an idiot
 turkey is not an oil exporter  but a medium price medium quality manufacturing state a "mexico" that is integrated to the global system in a subservient way 

and every "mexico" needs a "usa" only germany and the usa can fill that function for turkey
2488 2018-08-01 18:19:54 The irony. Imagine complaining about Tesla receiving support from the government while the oil industry receives billions. Trillions worldwide. As a Canadian, I feel exactly the same Andrei.
Time for the world to unshackle this ball & chain & stop subsidizing fossil fuels.

2497 2018-08-01 18:18:59 I jope my paws paws did come I. This year and not eaten by the squirrel and such. It is my past and recent opinion paw paws are a good fruit to eat when bitten by snake. It does something to the snake oil that makes the paw paw effective
2498 2018-08-01 18:18:54 Fraud and scams in JIO and reliance oil refineries and Essar fuel
2499 2018-08-01 18:18:41 Please explain to me how the Republicans running everything right now is good. Removing all safety regulations from just about every industry there is. Attempting to devastate & destroy all of our national parks for oil & fracking. No tax cut for the American people just the rich
2500 2018-08-01 18:18:27 I cover my face in honey, leave it on for an hour, then remove with a homemade scrub of olive oil and sugar. Supposedly honey draws out impurities plus is antibacterial/has anti-rosacea effects; the sugar exfoliates; the olive oil does whatever face oils are supposed to do.
2501 2018-08-01 18:18:27 Only a guilty snake oil salesman like #Trump would call for the investigation into his treacherous dealings be terminated. It’ll stop once he’s behind bars...
2502 2018-08-01 18:18:16 Turkey depend heavily on US money and technology than Russia. Capital outflaws from Russia always existed since oil boom in the 2000's .Sanctions had little impact.Drop in oil prices was the only key factor,

2504 2018-08-01 18:18:11 Growth of 8 core sectors which also include fertilisers, steel, natural gas, electricity & crude oil jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June.

Growth rate in May was 4.3%. Then, Modi failed Economy

Now, Growth jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June. But No one will talk about this.
2505 2018-08-01 18:18:05 Actually, a Chinese oil company was the first trillion dollar company. It’s worth ~$200 billion now though
2506 2018-08-01 18:18:01 Stop drinking the oil, sis. 
2507 2018-08-01 18:18:01 That’s your view but owning a vehicle shouldn’t be a necessity. Our public transport system isn’t the best but it works just fine. Our road infrastructure is already a problem and cost of crude oil will increase the burden on our resources
2508 2018-08-01 18:17:54 She is a liar. Being a liar is obviously gender neutral, since every person, male and female, in this corrupt regime lies constantly. It starts with the liar in chief and moves to all levels. Sanders is merely among the most visible.

2511 2018-08-01 18:17:21 $AAL, I guess oil prices really do not have anything to do Airline stocks. US Crude now Down 8$ dollars. Both plunging, not inverse, #logic

2520 2018-08-01 18:16:14 is rosehip oil good for oily skin? @LaBeautyologist
2521 2018-08-01 18:15:49 But your friend who jumped in to tell me I'm uneducated she's fine huh? Sad truth.  Learn geopolitics, learn about the dollar and its history, learn about oil propping up the dollar, learn, learn learn then come back and tell me who was uneducated.
2522 2018-08-01 18:15:47 I’ve had a rough day. I won $2 on a scratch off but my ticket won’t scan to cash then I tried to get an oil change (I’m 4,000 miles over) and my hood won’t open.
2523 2018-08-01 18:15:38 2. manera: GAS+[el mot que vol dir 'oli' en la llengua corresponent]. Per ex. alemany, Gasöl (öl=oli); italià, gasolio (olio=oli); danès, gasolie (olie=oli), etc.
El mot "gasoll" és una adaptació al català de 'gas oil', pronunciat en anglès. No cal dir que col·loquialment +
2524 2018-08-01 18:15:31 Again for the last time there is technology out outside of Texas that is creating NEW technology for the future where machines can run on instead of out dated coal and oil. Maybe you don’t have kids so ur not concerned about the future

2529 2018-08-01 18:15:04 Oil prices fell on Wednesday as a surprise increase in U.S. crude  stockpiles fed concerns about global oversupply, while investors  continued to worry that trade tensions could hit energy demand.
2530 2018-08-01 18:14:57 Dude- down load honey, and then everywhere I go I just  heck for coupons on google. Like today I got half off an oil change at jiffy lube.
2531 2018-08-01 18:14:28 Or, rub them with oil, lime juice, tequila, & salt and bake them into chips.  Totally throw out the cheddar cheese - its useless.
2532 2018-08-01 18:14:27 I don’t care what no one says your va-jay-jay should NOT smell like fish from the ocean! 
That is not healthy! I do agree that douching is not what we need to do.

“He doesn’t lie, he states facts  as he sees them” 

So if I rob a bank & see it as just borrowing a few bucks,
It is not a crime or a lie? 

Unbelievable
2538 2018-08-01 18:12:55 This “rejuvenation” is futile. Even if it were accomplished, and Pemex got back to where it was 10 years ago, it would still be uncompetitive with private oil companies (as Pemex was then). Meanwhile, much Mexican taxpayer money will find its way into corrupt politician pockets.
2539 2018-08-01 18:12:51 Was that lack of oil? Or the wrong oil?
2540 2018-08-01 18:12:35 Currently getting my oil changed  anyone have a new blog post I can read?
2541 2018-08-01 18:12:27 The fact that oil companies make a lot of money is not a defense for lacking moral integrity. The oil & gas industry is just as guilty as the tobacco industry for shilling a dangerous product without disclosing the extent of the risk involved. Just admit it.
2542 2018-08-01 18:12:24 Idyejxidkfjrkfkf I have so much to do before work and now my dad is pushing to take my car for an oil change and I appreciate it but ALSO I STILL GOTTA WASH MY CAR AND ALL THIS OTHER ATUFF
2543 2018-08-01 18:12:08 That oil change took so long... like.. they didn't even charge me
2544 2018-08-01 18:12:07 Sitting in jiffy lube getting an oil change and the daytime tv show “Girl Chat” is on. Older white woman points at the television and says, “these women should go to the kitchen to cook and clean something and then they’ll have a purpose in life” #ThisIsAmerica
2545 2018-08-01 18:11:58 Ugh I hate the smell of olive oil.

2549 2018-08-01 18:11:35 “Everyone knows Republicans and oil companies derailed action on climate change for decades. What this massive NYT magazine story presupposes is: What if they didn’t?"
2550 2018-08-01 18:11:19 didn’t know about coconut oil! thank you

2553 2018-08-01 18:11:00 Yes, it's actually not "bad." The coconut is creamy and there are many health benefits to daily use of coconut oil. HOWEVER, I like creamy ass cream from a cow. I don't need healthy coffee.
2554 2018-08-01 18:10:59 got the castor oil but ima check the biotin!
2555 2018-08-01 18:10:35 Try putting a we bit of olive oil in it babe should do the trick xx

2562 2018-08-01 18:09:36 Agriculture is based on oil through petro-fertilizers-pesticides. It will last only as long as oil lasts. Consider how much your food travels. We can not isolate ourselves from the greater matrix of life. Technological solutions are based on depletion of that matrix.
2563 2018-08-01 18:09:33 Lol pls stop, it sounds disgusting
2564 2018-08-01 18:09:32 You don't know It takes oil from drilling to run machines? You don't know it takes pipelines to flow the oil around the country? People that make their living from coal like mining. I think you're talking about a 3rd. world nation where they produce nothing, not America.

2567 2018-08-01 18:09:12 I went to check the oil in my car because it’s been making a mad noise when I turn the engine off and I can’t tell you how unimaginably annoying it is that my non-driver sister who has a minus amount of car knowledge was over my shoulder telling me what she thinks the problem is

Sometimes it's starts,sometimes NOT!
When it starts; sometimes backfires
Doesn't start with out a boost
Runs out of oil,before gasoline
Rolls down hill without anyone in it
Right into the swamp
Passengers fight..
Riders pay to ride
2574 2018-08-01 18:07:57 Unfuckingbelievable!! Good thing I missed my TV when I threw a bottle of olive oil while she was spewing the  defending his ridiculous statement about needing I.D when you shop. How do you defend the indefensible?? FML.
2575 2018-08-01 18:07:55 The problem is that for people with peanut allergies, even the peanut dust or oil in the air can be deadly. I have a relative that can not fly SW because of it.
2576 2018-08-01 18:07:43 That is the great thing about @selfpubwithdale he isn't selling snake oil.
2577 2018-08-01 18:07:33 And the triumphant return of a 60s-ish Oil Can Boyd
2578 2018-08-01 18:07:22 Put a little oil and salt on them. It'd make a great snack.
2579 2018-08-01 18:07:16 the easiest thing I know how to make? chop some potatoes, put some parsley, garlic, salt and pepper and stick them on a pan with aluminum foil and olive oil for 450 degrees...cook for about 20 mins !! and BEST lunch

2582 2018-08-01 18:07:04 @YarnellSchool first I want to thank you for your show. I make it a priority on my watch list. My question is. I'm a self taught tattoo artist.  And I've been thinking of oil painting. Any suggestions for someone who's never touched canvas with a brush?
2583 2018-08-01 18:06:56 My grandad took my car to get an oil change

2586 2018-08-01 18:05:27 Oh yeah I forgot put raising and cashew nuts when making the vegetables or fry them a bit in the oil you used to fry onions. I know it sounds like a long process but the food is really yummy and once u get used to making it you won’t feel it’s a long process. I hope you enjoy it.
2587 2018-08-01 18:05:21 What was their estimate for increases in medical costs due to air pollution? 

Oh wait, they obviously didn't look at that. Including all factors is how responsible government decisions are made, not how you give handouts to your pals in the oil industry.
2588 2018-08-01 18:05:09 Inspection and oil change done guess I’m responsible boy today
2589 2018-08-01 18:04:36 Only first tried it yesterday with oil paints until I get my tablet. I’m glad I don’t have to do it for a living

Garlic fried yellow courgette, big old tomato with olive oil + balsamic vinegar + basil leaf, sweet potato pakoras (not homemade), yoghurt with garlic and mint, fresh bread and cheese. Raspberries for dessert.

Kind of a pic and mix.

2599 2018-08-01 18:03:32 True,there is a possibility that these mafias will be selling local oil by tagging it as imported one like other industries are doing: local wrist watch as "made in Switzerland".

2605 2018-08-01 18:02:59 #SaudiArabia is a stain on humanity. The entire world should be ashamed for allowing it. They have lots of supporters though, and that will continue as long as oil is important. Hopefully that will end soon.

2611 2018-08-01 18:02:39 Local oil produced is being supplies to National refinary. By 2020 Pakistan would be able to increase prod & will no longer import oil
2612 2018-08-01 18:02:34 Snake oil
2613 2018-08-01 18:02:25 Smelling like straight coconut oil
2614 2018-08-01 18:02:18 My Dad Was Gonna Use My Car But It As Stuff In It So He Didn’t And He Got Mad At Me For It  I’m Sorry Do You Put Gas In My Car ? Do You Buy My Oil I Put In That Car ? The Brakes ? No
2615 2018-08-01 18:02:09 Of course, I would need new back breaks in my car when all I was expecting was to get an oil change, and tires rotated.  
2616 2018-08-01 18:01:58 Oil and gas business man sir
2617 2018-08-01 18:01:46 Onions, a bit of paprika, shimeji mushrooms as well as slices button mushrooms sizzling in some olive oil
2618 2018-08-01 18:01:38 On the whole I agree with you but a) think sadly it's too late, way too many cooks (no pun intended) with little quality-control and b) while many docs are giving great advice, I've lost count of how many MDs have jumped on the snake oil bandwagon. I wince at some insta accounts.
2619 2018-08-01 18:01:11 Toothless hicks and red necks huh?And yet nobody shot him or even punched him in the face like a woke lefty would do
2620 2018-08-01 18:01:05 WHO owns the whisky, salmon, electricity and oil industries  ?
2621 2018-08-01 18:00:55 The Socialist Party w no face..they all suck and sell snake oil,so take your pick!?
2622 2018-08-01 18:00:48 We Need Coconut oil, some SHEEN and Some Bath Salt Products

2625 2018-08-01 18:00:36 today's lazy dinner came out pretty well imo: a big ol' pot of steamed greens, drizzled w/ olive oil & vinegar, and served w/ a slice of bread and a slice of feta cheese
2626 2018-08-01 18:00:34 *aren’t* Capitalism doesn’t depend on any wars or oil. It just moves to where demand is and wherever it can provide value.
2627 2018-08-01 18:00:20 Shawty gave me a nice ass full body massage with coconut oil...I precede to massage her booty and give her backshots...lift my leg to give her angles...4 strokes later my foot slips off the edge and bangs on the footboard...

I 
Am
In 
Pain
2628 2018-08-01 18:00:12 WHAT OIL THO
2629 2018-08-01 17:59:56 Socialized medicine is already violating patient rights in America. My brother who needs his pain medication to get to work painting houses has to fight his doctor who tells him he must use cannibas oil instead of his usual script. If there's no freedom there will be no peace.
2630 2018-08-01 17:59:48 Learned my lesson guess where I’m at  VALVOLINE GETTING THIS OIL CHANGE 
2631 2018-08-01 17:59:46 It’s Awesome! When Clients Call You Because The Holy Blend Oil Has Helped?!? Sweetness! God is Good Testimonials
2632 2018-08-01 17:59:37 SHSHSGSHHS OIL AND MASSAGE YOUR SCALP IT’LL SAVE U HUNNY!
2633 2018-08-01 17:59:35 You know what really grinds my gears... when i don't have oil in my gears which then results in my gears grinding...
2634 2018-08-01 17:59:33 Anecdotally, I start my day off with a coffee with grass fed butter and mct oil. For me, it suppresses hunger and gives me consistent energy throughout the day. Days I miss, I notice mid afternoon.
2635 2018-08-01 17:59:32 Lol see dead pitch
2636 2018-08-01 17:59:21 -@toywatkins told me to put coconut oil in my coffee to replace the creamer so I tried it this morning. 

Also, going to get some creamer this evening.
2637 2018-08-01 17:59:20 No, wages are not rising, maybe not yet, but I wish the exaggeration would go away. Not in the oil and gas industry at least not for women.
2638 2018-08-01 17:59:07 Dude they have too much shale oil,they can't get it out fast enough,they have to put more pipeline in...jobs
2639 2018-08-01 17:58:59 I use coconut oil. Yeah I’ve been thinking to take that route
2640 2018-08-01 17:58:58 Also I mean you can use like oil trucks as dildos, and that's great 
2641 2018-08-01 17:58:53 Thank you! I love it, I'm a total Hadley fan. I also loved the Goop NYT piece - v clever. But what a disgrace that GP is able to peddle so much snake oil so lucratively.
2642 2018-08-01 17:58:45 Honestly surprised that “Energy” doesn’t get a category here - you could argue that Hydro results in a huge amount of land use (well, water use).  Plus oil fields, coal mining, etc. on top of solar and wind farms.
2643 2018-08-01 17:58:39 Last time I EVER drop my car off at @Walmart for an oil change. Told me 1 hour max and here I am, still waiting, over 2 hours later.. Simple oil change. Thank God I told them not to rotate tires or vacuum or I’d still be here tomorrow. Not like I had anything to do..
2644 2018-08-01 17:58:37 Sounds like my kinda party B) gotta bring the coconut oil
2645 2018-08-01 17:58:31 @EagleHonda so much for "Express" service this morning. 15ish minutes turned into nearly 2 hours for a simple oil and filter change, with no explanation
2646 2018-08-01 17:58:29 . But your players wants to leave. Jose and third season are like water and oil
2647 2018-08-01 17:58:28 Did you even read it? IF the oil passage to Red Sea is blocked
2648 2018-08-01 17:58:22 Wow! So Interesting! I had no idea that peppermint oil could pass through the BBB. Question: Could it be used as a carrier to get other things through?
2649 2018-08-01 17:58:15 So let's stop all the extravagant tax breaks and subsidies to millionaires and the gun industry and oil and tobacco corporations, then we'll all easily have health care.
2650 2018-08-01 17:58:12 Maknanya dua benda yg berbeza laa kan? Ingat an sama..  Sebab ATF tu dah tukar tapi gearbox oil tu xpena tukar lagi kot.. Dulu bila nk tukar gear mcm smooth je, tapi skrg ni bila tukar, dia mcm keras sikit dan bunyi 'ketak'
2651 2018-08-01 17:58:10 What kind of oil? You need to get shampoo that’s specifically for the issue. You need to see a dermatologist btw.
2652 2018-08-01 17:58:08 おかしい、こんな言説は許されない
FGOキッズどうかしてる
2653 2018-08-01 17:57:50 Needa damn oil change too 
2654 2018-08-01 17:57:34 I swear coconut oil is my life lol
2655 2018-08-01 17:57:28 Maybe. I know that tallow candles create a lot of smoke, which is bad for your health. Whale oil & beeswax candles each burn w/o smoke & w/little to no smell. Modern day, gas & kerosene probably aren't the most healthy; but, they do produce little to no smoke.
2656 2018-08-01 17:57:27 We let the lay and the media define these things, so it went wild. Despite dietary factors as #1 cause premature death (US Burden of Disease Collab), we haven’t really helped people change, so they found snake oil. Medicine needs to reclaim dietary advice.

2659 2018-08-01 17:57:08 Garlic, Chilli, a bit of oil and lemon. Absolutely delicious.
2660 2018-08-01 17:56:44 What are your proofs?

2662 2018-08-01 17:56:27 One would expect their top targets would instead be ALL the Saudi oil refineries & Riyad , and to mine the Straits
2663 2018-08-01 17:56:23 Mum bought in to the essential oil life. Practically uses it all the time. Never seen her happier.
2664 2018-08-01 17:56:18 This year I visited MGPCL Islamabad (so called top petroleum company) & get highly disappoint what I found on top position of MD & General manager was just #Hypocrisy #greed Unprofessional attitude selfcentered egocentric leadership.Oil&Gas companies r mafia & black mailers
2665 2018-08-01 17:56:14 I feel like no matter how much oil I use it always gets dry and flakes.
2666 2018-08-01 17:56:09 こんなん気狂いでしかないわ
2667 2018-08-01 17:56:05 US Treasury/Fed using HFT to control inflation & save their own skin while throwing farmers, miners, oil producers, investors under the bus. Sound familiar #UpticRule @LukeGromen @nntaleb @ScandalOfMoney @realDonaldTrump
2668 2018-08-01 17:56:00 So my cousin works for an "essential oil" MLM and is using a type of CANNABIS OIL for her family to help with their anxiety claiming it's safe but is questioning VACCINES to make them healthy. Her kids are both under 5. I CANNOT...
2669 2018-08-01 17:55:47 Use peppermint and tea tree oil
2670 2018-08-01 17:55:41 As per my knowledge, they mix minoxidil solution with coconut oil. I felt the small of minoxidil when I bought. Minoxidil can lead to hair growth, but when you stop, you will lose more than what you had already. So you can't stop using.  I wouldn't recommend it.
2671 2018-08-01 17:55:39 はwwwwwww?????WWWWWwwwwwwwwwwwwwww??????????????????????Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww??????????????
2672 2018-08-01 17:55:30 They definitely aren't pro much anything  worthwhile.
2673 2018-08-01 17:55:30 They sell, we buy. As reserves run out, oil and gas prices are probably going to double in real terms in the next 20 years @El_Spy @TheTyee
2674 2018-08-01 17:55:26 @Influenster I’m having a hard time finding the country crock with sunflower oil. I’ve been to 3 different grocery stores. Help!
2675 2018-08-01 17:55:23 Don't forget they gonna help you oil her engine very well
2676 2018-08-01 17:55:20 Sis, get the baby oil and camera ready! I’m coming over tonight  @AllDolldUp_
2677 2018-08-01 17:55:18 Yeah, gave it a bit of a scrub. I think another oil change well before it's due is on the cards.
2678 2018-08-01 17:55:13 Lol this one has no sense of humor,y u so bitter
2679 2018-08-01 17:55:00 I’m tryna do my oil change and everytime !! Something else always dirty ! JUST CHANGE THE DAMN OIL SON!!
2680 2018-08-01 17:54:38 I'm worse at 81%. Mostly on 'home' so if you divide that by the four of us that brings it down a bit. Need to get off oil heating and install solar.
2681 2018-08-01 17:54:35 Anti-Putin is the common goal of Hillary Obama Soros and Genie oil Fox Hannity etc.
2682 2018-08-01 17:54:25 Don’t forget to rub it in oil, and also sing to it
2683 2018-08-01 17:54:23 Need a fucking oil change too
2684 2018-08-01 17:54:23 BP Oil SPILL...
2685 2018-08-01 17:54:15 For what it’s worth, I have to stop and get my oil changed first, so that will slow me down.
2686 2018-08-01 17:54:15 Oil Cartridges by Craft Concentrates are on SALE! Check our deals tab on Weedmaps, Leafly and Leafbuyer for more info! #sale #mmj #cannabis
2687 2018-08-01 17:54:08 Using a picture of the venuzulan lader wiping his head and just captioning it with whatever you want doesn't change the fact that their a country with genocidal sanctions forced against them because of their oil reserves and true democracy.
2688 2018-08-01 17:54:05 ARE YOU READY? THE STAGE IS SET. ALL ROADS LEAD TO THE OIL CITY OF WARRI FOR GBARAMATUVOICE 3RD ANNIVERSARY/AWARD DINNER 2018.
2689 2018-08-01 17:54:00 What is the plan, to pay for MF, when people start moving off the grid? Who the hell pays? Move to Parsons Pond and find that oil bubbling out of the ground. Kerosene lamps and cellars.
2690 2018-08-01 17:53:55 Only occasionally agree with Hanoi Jane! Justin sure looks Green(behind the ears) but is anything but. Canada uses the most enviromentally horrible methods to extract tar sands oil and calls us out on climate change! Fracking is clean compared to their BS!
2691 2018-08-01 17:53:52 He looks like an old-school oil tycoon and I love it
2692 2018-08-01 17:53:52 And the right worries about government controlling our lives. Hey @GOP , this is actually what it looks like when gov starts controlling you. Legislate how much you should drive? Can you please call BS? Because this is nothing more than a gift to big oil, who owns your reps.
2693 2018-08-01 17:53:49 Do you oil or ever?
2694 2018-08-01 17:53:48 coconut oil everything is my best friend x

2696 2018-08-01 17:53:35 My oil change went from 0 - to needing a new ac filter and it costing me 50 bucks
2697 2018-08-01 17:53:07 Adulting is being excited to get an oil change and a car wash
2698 2018-08-01 17:53:01 What you will do if all the oil starting to be trade on another currency then US dólar?
2699 2018-08-01 17:52:58 Security forces in Iraq’s southern Basra province prevented demonstrators from storming a major petroleum facility on Wednesday.
“A joint force stopped dozens of protesters from forcing their way into an oil station in West Qurna 1 Oilfield,” Army Lieutenant Mohamed Khalaf told.

2701 2018-08-01 17:52:34 The word of God is a 360 gospel.

The name of Jesus is in its lane.
The Blood of Jesus is in its lane.
Worship is in its lane. It goes on and on. Seek wisdom & speak against none. Peace!!!
2702 2018-08-01 17:52:34 Iron ore prices jump 3.47% (NMDC, sandur ) ,While crude fall 2% ( oil marketing ,airlines ). Aluminium down 2% .
2703 2018-08-01 17:52:28 Time for an oil change again 
2704 2018-08-01 17:52:24 Yes, we must NEVER criticize women, even if they express support for fascists.
2705 2018-08-01 17:52:07 WITH CANDLES TOO. Sometimes I use a diffuser, sometimes I light a candle. Why? BECAUSE it does the same damn thing! The essential oil isn’t somehow more magical! It just smells nice!
2706 2018-08-01 17:52:03 Yesterday when I made stir fry the sauce was just a bit of soy sauce, fish sauce, and sesame oil sprinkled over it. Might try mixing them up before hand with a touch of brown sugar next time. Thoughts?
2707 2018-08-01 17:51:58 #gtfo and sell snake oil in some other land !!
2708 2018-08-01 17:51:53 I really want an essential oil diffuser but I don’t want to kill my cat
2709 2018-08-01 17:51:43 Nice! You need to stop worrying when there are no oil leaks... as that usually means there's no oil left in there!
2710 2018-08-01 17:51:30 Quando scrivete "oil of the tuna" io inizio a canticchiarla sulle note di "eye of the tiger"
2711 2018-08-01 17:51:20 it's shocking how few medical professionals know the cholesterol content of olive oil (0) or the relative difference in cholesterol levels between meats (none) .. it's quite sad, actually @AmerMedicalAssn

2714 2018-08-01 17:50:20 So happy I get free oil changes for three years. 
2715 2018-08-01 17:50:11 This was in Caracas, our Capital...but the other states including Falcon State, where the two most important oil refineries are located, suffers energy collapse every single day !!! for up to 37 hours without electricity.
2716 2018-08-01 17:50:09 Drove far way to pick up my order @jimmyjohns because there isn't one in my city and to my disappoint my order was wrong, first I said no mayo and add oil and cucumbers but there was mayo but no oil or cucumbers. #sandwich #sad #youknow #thatfeeling
2717 2018-08-01 17:50:03 Sounds like the Tesla electric cars aren't doing so hot. Here's a shocker. Batteries in electric cars die and have to be replace. It's a HELL OF A LOT more expensive than an oil change. Suddenly reality comes crashing down on the eco-friendly pipe dream.
2718 2018-08-01 17:50:01 Now take the chicken when it’s done cut it to small pieces so you have chunks of chicken, take the soup boil the rice with it, put salt (no oil) and put chicken Maggie (the one you put in food not the noodles substance) but if you can’t get Maggie then just put salt...

2740 2018-08-01 17:46:29 I don't understand why fried food causes gout. One would think the cooking oil would lubricate one's joints.
2741 2018-08-01 17:46:29 Different types of Oil?
2742 2018-08-01 17:46:29 We do! 

We have garlic, salt, mayo, oil, and lemon juice 
2743 2018-08-01 17:46:26 First they peddle fiction about shortage in oil supply driving #oilprice up and now, hey we found some 5 million barrels a day under a rock somewhere in America. Down goes oil.

2745 2018-08-01 17:46:21 @PemexGlobal @BP_America what will you do when oil spills will begin to happen due to fracking in native land (la huasteca potosina). The communities are also aware that water is currently being privatized. You will leave indigenous communities without water or land.
2746 2018-08-01 17:46:17 Looks good. I wonder why those couple of young living essential oil sit next to your mayo. Your secret sauce maybe?

2761 2018-08-01 17:43:49 I think he is suggesting that China will make a move to make the Yen a reserve currency to be able to buy Oil, similar to what they did with Angola in 2013.

Local governnents, State governments, federal government need to reduce welfare to corporate welfare queen parasites - Amazon, banks, oil, coal, Apple, Facebook, Google, Comcast, prescription drugs, electricity, Nestle, etc.  Welfare to them over $20 trillion since Reagan
2766 2018-08-01 17:43:06 Why is the "oil bear" not talking about the drop in US production for the past week. You have mentioned every increase in production. Oh, right, it does not fit your narrative. What again was you BS target for US oil production for year end? Lets just say, it if flat out wrong.
2767 2018-08-01 17:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
2768 2018-08-01 17:42:53 You kept the door open, I see

2770 2018-08-01 17:42:38 Good on You Coles...If the Powers that be want to stop Plastic Use ( bags & Every other Form of plastic use) that's fantastic. Then STOP the Production of bags of Plastic Pallets from Oil residual process from the Oil Refineries. The Plastic Bag debarcle is only Tokenism...

2773 2018-08-01 17:42:02 Cynical politics to get though the next election by a government that just doesn’t get it. You can bet industry in Ontario and Quebec get better treatment than the Alberta and SK  oil and gas industry.
2774 2018-08-01 17:41:56 If you see what happened to SE Asia in the late 90s, is that they had to use ther FX reserves to tackle dissparity between their currnecy & the USD. @LukeGromen is speaking about a move from China to make the Yen a reserve currency to be able to buy Oil. Luke did I got it right?
2775 2018-08-01 17:41:50 But Trump said his discussions with Putin were fine and, therefore, I'm sure that any problems have been properly fixed in a very stable and genius-y way. Ms. Siskind, I have a wonderful snake oil product which I'm sure you'll be ...…...

2782 2018-08-01 17:41:11 I heard that castor oil is really good for hair growth. People put it on their eyelashes, brows, and scalp and seem to get good results. I’m about to get some myself today lol, I gotta see this for myself

2786 2018-08-01 17:40:32 I would rather plug in, for a fraction of the cost and at night, than have to go to a freaking gas station, be raped by Big Oil and still pollute the earth.
2787 2018-08-01 17:40:15 But it will absorb oil and when it’s time to polish, it may be quite expensive.

2791 2018-08-01 17:39:55 LOL, because the way we use oil is comparable to the way use water & air. Also natural regeneration is completely different. Ridiculous comparison
2792 2018-08-01 17:39:48 Oil changes be taking forever 
2793 2018-08-01 17:39:39 In actuality, peppermint oil lozenges could work for many ailments including brain. The ability to pass the blood-brain barrier is HUGE! The power of your own immune system is also. (c) G. M. Selemon
2794 2018-08-01 17:39:35 I’m sorry you get them, so do I. So sad to see so many others get them too! What is going on?! Nothing is full safe for me, tried everything listed here except CBD. Best ones for me are Biofreeze, magnesium oil, packs of ice, excedrin. But none make me functional.

2812 2018-08-01 17:37:23 Our soya yield is fraction of many large countries. Improving it will save us of huge forex & help in massive value addition to farmers. Creating high yield sesame seeds can reduce prices of this oil & spur consumption
2813 2018-08-01 17:37:18 Honestly this Africa's best hair oil I think is a huge to key to growing hair. I finished a whole bottle and it's like my hair just keeps growing but when I stop I notice it's not the same rate. That's my second bottle.
2814 2018-08-01 17:37:06 I think you could have them lick your feet clean after a muddy barefoot stroll then gunge them with lots of brutal slop (mud, paint, oil...) then ignore for a while and see how you feel...
2815 2018-08-01 17:37:04 and, if the Antwerp project goes forward, the facility will not be ready

2821 2018-08-01 17:36:23 saw this beginning aft the oil spill, when some were derailed (conf calls, group chats etc) into believing in this old redneck who claimed to know secrets about "the plan" the "white hats" had since kennedy to overthrow "the elite." it was a way to misdirect everyone's rage at BP
2822 2018-08-01 17:36:13 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
2823 2018-08-01 17:36:04 If your referring to Iran, you do know the only Money they got was money that was held from the sale of their oil. Not one taxpayer dollar was sent. We used their money to bargain a stop in nuclear development. Sounds like a plan to me.

Only then will the lute-playing plum orchard keepers known as ANTIFA wake us with lavender soaps and analingus each dawn.

2834 2018-08-01 17:35:01 A poor man can’t get into cattle based dairy or farming business because Gaurakshaks may mistake them for smugglers and lynch them. Pakodas need oil for frying which needs gas for the heat. With the current LPG price, pakora business to done. Does BJP have any other suggestions?
2835 2018-08-01 17:35:00 i'll bet the creampuff with the fresh beard oil won't be able to manage it.

2840 2018-08-01 17:34:46 So there are natural deodorants that don’t have aluminum or baking soda in them, and their main ingredients are other things! The Kopari one is made from coconut oil!!! So hopefully it works nicely 
2841 2018-08-01 17:34:38 Not to be annoying but I started using CBD oil and it makes that voice so much quieter and if you can try it then I recommend! 
2842 2018-08-01 17:34:37 How many have recommended coconut oil? (teasing)

2854 2018-08-01 17:33:02 Oh no! Peppermint Halo in the eyes is never a good thing. If this happens again, we recommend wiping the eye area with a soft cloth soaked in vegetable oil, Please feel free to send us a DM if you need any further support.

2864 2018-08-01 17:31:40 Keep telling yourself that crap. Canada beg us to stay in 1995. La prochaine fois ne sera pas ainsi. Quebec is becoming Canada leader in clean energy. The future of oil based economy is numbered. Even Saudi Arabia is learning that.

2868 2018-08-01 17:31:21 it's easier than you think. The most important thing: #1 Lose the salt! Salt retains liquid, so a big part of your weigth right now is water that can't leave. #2 Lose the soda, seriously, learn to hate it. #3 Lose the sugar, minimize it all you can. #4 Lose the butter, soy oil+
2869 2018-08-01 17:31:13 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but years.

2873 2018-08-01 17:30:55 That one can dry you out too, but I add a teaspoon of coconut oil to combat the dryness. Works great

2886 2018-08-01 17:29:26 7/31/18. Houthis unilaterally halt attacks in the Red Sea for two weeks to support peace efforts in Yemen, saying the halt could be extended and expanded. The Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers, impelling Saudi Arabia to suspend shipments in the Red Sea until it is safe.
2887 2018-08-01 17:29:22 Sweet baby Jesus...never knew that was a thing. I read that dripping oil in the ear can kill the bug. And a doctor will be able to remove it easily, or you can try yourself with tweezers. Good luck! Let us know if the bastard gets out.
2888 2018-08-01 17:29:15 We allow this affront to civility to continue. Economists are the modern day snake oil salesmen claiming to have all found a cure. The quicker we do away with money the better.
2889 2018-08-01 17:29:00 Wouldn't it be fitting if the oil and gas guy (Tillerson) turns out to be the hero of the Trump administration?
2890 2018-08-01 17:28:58 Be happy when a hard boiled egg doesn’t peel perfectly. The freshest eggs don’t, & are the best. Just add a few drops Olive oil, salt, black pepper, dried origano....
2891 2018-08-01 17:28:50 Frustrating tho, #Wressle green light would double SP too. #UJO

Had coms with a few of the councillors, left with the impression they'll block anything! Much happier getting their oil from the Middle East. As that's much more environmentally friendly? 
2892 2018-08-01 17:28:36 1. Not 1 drop of oil was found (yet) in the Golan. 

2. When Syria attacked israel in 1967, it should have thought about the possibility it might lose its back yard....
2893 2018-08-01 17:28:33 Don't listen to this person
2894 2018-08-01 17:28:32 Burning midnight oil. Waiting for #FOMC
2895 2018-08-01 17:28:27 In 2007 Russia used a mini submarine to plant a russian flag on the bottom of the ocean in the North Pole in an attempt to lay claim to the land and the ensuing oil reserves. Russia is that shirtless dude tryna sell u molly next to the porta-potties. Respect the hustle.
2896 2018-08-01 17:28:25 I thought the current stalemate would see State House directly intervene to resolve the underlying issues...but wapi?
2897 2018-08-01 17:27:58 So @MBuhari is going to London on a medical trip, to use tax payers/ crude oil money to improve the health sector of another country? Yet the health sector of his country is collapsing. What a wicked president
2898 2018-08-01 17:27:57 2nd amendment is being protected all right, while the 1st amendment is being torn down by a dictatorial snake oil salesman...and work harder?  a lot of folks are forced to work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet, unlike the poster buy for inherited wealth aka DJT
2899 2018-08-01 17:27:36 neem oil, shit tons of neem oil hth ;)
2900 2018-08-01 17:27:17 Aww how do you do it?  We brown sugar first in some oil here and after it “dissolves/caramelizes” we add in our seasoned meats.
2901 2018-08-01 17:27:15 It's just an opinion, and not a great one at that! All the other "greats" of "plant based diet" condemn coconut oil totally. It's terrible, saturated fat and all that. I'll go with the Swede on this.
2902 2018-08-01 17:27:12 Does automotive insurance cover your oil changes, tire replacements, tune-ups, etc? No. They are not losses. An example of a loss would be if someone crashed into your car damaging it. Routine maintenance is not a loss.
2903 2018-08-01 17:27:12 We dont get free oil from Saudi Arabia any more. In respect of Iranian crude, banks are not opening L/Cs.
2904 2018-08-01 17:26:50 1st sentence is "Mexico wouldn't have to pay for the wall" and then says cutting welfare to illegals would pay for it. You better believe THAT would be Mexico paying for the wall, because REMITTANCES are Mexico's no.1 income source, even more than their govt owned oil industry!
2905 2018-08-01 17:26:49 Thing is, its a great pre shave oil. The only problem is the name. Its just...so cringy...
2906 2018-08-01 17:26:45 Do I dry before oil or not?
2907 2018-08-01 17:26:39 Do you think Olive Oil, Popeyes Girl Friend could whip up on Trump???

2909 2018-08-01 17:26:24 Grate then fry in olive oil and butter. Season, add some cream and warm through. Nice side.
2910 2018-08-01 17:26:08 An oil change and a full tank of gas gets me just as hype as a mani and a haircut 
2911 2018-08-01 17:26:01 หัวร้อนละนี่เรื่องกุเองสัสไม่เกี่ยวคนอื่น WTF
2912 2018-08-01 17:25:58 All of those tourists covered with oil.
2913 2018-08-01 17:25:56 Someday his hair person will write a tell-all & it will be beautiful. (We'll read it by the light of an oil drum bc the electrical grid will be down, but still.)
2914 2018-08-01 17:25:52 Gerrarahere madam
2915 2018-08-01 17:25:47 Well, that certainly is one way to deal with the rising oil prices his administration has unwittingly aided and abetted.
2916 2018-08-01 17:25:32 tea tree oil, Jamaican black castor oil, jojoba oil, & carrot oil (nourishment for growth okuurr) if you don’t already use these lol
2917 2018-08-01 17:25:19 Agreed .many of these damned wars iraq libya are corporate funded and initiated by banks, oil industry etc and yes the banking industry is disproportianately jewish and jews have been disproportionately involved .
2918 2018-08-01 17:25:09 The left is not pro-woman, pro-minority, pro-anything other that pro-"us."
Anything not "us" to them must be destroyed and eliminated.

Even worse is apostasy.  Publicly leaving the left is a crime demanding immediate retribution with a hive mind mentality that borders on evil.
2919 2018-08-01 17:25:08 I am not saying, we will run out of oil in the near future. All that I am saying is, that there is a fundamental difference between the reserves of oil and the reserves of water. I personally hope, that we just don't need oil after some point, because of better technology.
2920 2018-08-01 17:25:03 Nah I have had ENOUGH OF WASPS. Just because I smell of orange blossom and Argan oil doesn’t mean you can HARASS ME

2922 2018-08-01 17:24:55 I think I need to switch from a lotion to an oil or a butter to stay moisturized. The older I get, the faster I dry out. Jessica Sojourner-Turner...will you be my guide?
2923 2018-08-01 17:24:55 The best part of being a mother of two is..each one is assigned a foot to massage.although i cant walk because they oil my feet and i would slip but still its free and lasts for more than 30 min.
2924 2018-08-01 17:24:49 Sitting at the car dealership getting an oil change and this boy is in here yelling at his mom because he wrecked his car. For one, my momma would have snatched me up so quick. Two, I wouldn’t even have a car after today
2925 2018-08-01 17:24:45 Is super-fun, as it means never having to accept responsibility for anything! 

Got laid off bc you were lazy? Nope—Jews.

Car broke down by you forgot to change the oil? Think again!

Poor diet and sedentary lifestyle lead to heart attack? Pssh.

Try it!

2926 2018-08-01 17:24:40 Send them to me! But otherwise, you can slice lengthways + griddle them, then preserve under oil, fritters are nice, or cook into ratatouille/baked Mediterranean veg and freeze.
2927 2018-08-01 17:24:20 John it's the growth commision report & it is actually a worst case scenario without oil & with austerity it proves that we could still be Indy  ask the tories who came up with it.
2928 2018-08-01 17:24:19 Brown sugar, olive oil and honey, you can also use coconut oil if you want
2929 2018-08-01 17:24:00 Who is the 3rd person? Asking for a friend
2930 2018-08-01 17:23:58 @KrisKobach1787 is an amazing snake oil salesman! Create the fear, fan the flames and then sell the product.  What an embarrassment...
2931 2018-08-01 17:23:55 Of you getting into the oil field and actually taking selfies 
2932 2018-08-01 17:23:46 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.

2934 2018-08-01 17:23:25 Gratted my cabbage fried it in coconut  oil.
 Fried onions added mince .. with chopped tomato.

I fried mixed peppers and cherry tomatoes.

Layered my cabbage  in a ceramic oven  bowl.. added lil bit of cheese .. then added mince.. topped with my fried tomatoes and peppers .
2935 2018-08-01 17:23:22 Agreed, however, nothing seems to stick on the snake oil.
2936 2018-08-01 17:23:17 Got oil dripping down my neck like jheri curl juice  I'm effing up out here like I was born natural yesterday 
2937 2018-08-01 17:23:15 correct  - oil in Golan doesn’t belong to Israel , illegal occupation. Genie Energy with Western oligarchs atop are stealing Syrian resources for their own selfish interest. Doesn’t even help the avg Israeli illegal settler one iota that they do so.
2938 2018-08-01 17:23:05 turmeric, cayenne pepper, ginger, cinnamon, honey, coconut oil, bicarbonate of soda, lemon, apple cider vinegar and garlic all blended into a beautiful drink to cure my throat problems xx
2939 2018-08-01 17:22:51 1000+340 million for dumbos.. where US has just 340 million & China has same as India but in 5 times larger country, much resourceful... only India has 500m poor in the world & has to suffer delays/inefficiencies of democracy.. India spends half of its revenue in buying OIL
2940 2018-08-01 17:22:26 Alternative sources and technology advance faster than oil decline in the most aggressive assumptions of demand, and that is before estimating unconventionals
2941 2018-08-01 17:22:18 Use an essential oil diffuser and choose lavender
2942 2018-08-01 17:22:09 I need someone to come get my car and get the oil changed....I can’t even imagine when I’ll have time to do that 
2943 2018-08-01 17:21:49 Peppermint oil does wonders if you have anal fissures or inflammed tissues... It's amazing!
2944 2018-08-01 17:21:47 that tea tree oil>>
2945 2018-08-01 17:21:43 Waiting 2 hours at Walmart for an oil change which isn’t a huge deal they are busy but holly fuck they have had the same 2 cars in the bay for and hour now..
2946 2018-08-01 17:21:24 Does he use a dashboard to keep track of the small refiner/Big Oil waivers?  
2947 2018-08-01 17:21:22 Fractionated coconut oil is a better essential oil carrier oil than jojoba oil, don't @ me.
2948 2018-08-01 17:21:21 @Jordan_Sather_ #DISCLOSURE my fear...even after @POTUS #Qanon reveal certain truths, many will be held back in favor of corporate support (big oil) and tech will still be suppressed. Personal Opinion. #MAGA BY FULL DISCLOSURE. The sooner the better. We can take it.
2949 2018-08-01 17:21:18 this honestly feels like ur telling me that someone threw 20 tons of oil into the ocean and i should ignore it 
2950 2018-08-01 17:21:06 Oil man loses his soul.
2951 2018-08-01 17:20:56 Don’t even get me started on these. Truffle oil, if it’s actually even that, is used to mask how shitty the fry actually is. Fries need nothing more than a little salt to be delicious.
2952 2018-08-01 17:20:53 Why did I just find a cheese stick in my owl essential oil thing.... two is not the fun age y’all I’m telling you 
2953 2018-08-01 17:20:50 Keep your transfer payments. You may need it with your dirty oil at barely $70 as tu compris monsieur?
2954 2018-08-01 17:20:44 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
2955 2018-08-01 17:20:38 So tasty! I want to oil those up and slide between them ASAP!! MMM
2956 2018-08-01 17:20:12 Kerosene oil and fire-wood to come into fashion again! Oh no! I forgot to mention the nostalgia of that uppla angithi/chulha (dried-up cow-dung based oven).
2957 2018-08-01 17:20:05 Trying so hard to figure this one out!
Lorenzo's Oil? Is it?
2958 2018-08-01 17:20:02 A crazy father likes oil.
2959 2018-08-01 17:19:58 Always feeling insecure when it comes to getting my oil changed.
2960 2018-08-01 17:19:56 Black women should actually be exonerated from paying tax on body lotions and creams. We still have to mix the cream with a whole of oils be it coconut oil, glycerin, cocoa butter oil and and... please @CyrilRamaphosa @GovernmentZA #GirlTalkZA
2961 2018-08-01 17:19:54 I agree 100%. I wonder why Delta state was even selected as a host. Though it's my state of origin but things seem to be on a very very slow pace. It's a pity. The one time vibrant oil city
2962 2018-08-01 17:19:53 Saudi Aramco has one of the lowest oil extraction cost yet the government couldn't afford to keep the subsidy going on. This guy is high on something experimental. I'm telling you.
2963 2018-08-01 17:19:32 Mii car is at jiffy lube getting all fixed up  oil change and everything else , thanks bby daddy 
2964 2018-08-01 17:19:21 I have not voted labour since Blair took everyone for a gullible fools lying of Sadam WMD killing Millions of innocent people Looting Iraq of it Wealth and Oil 
I am Shia and we suffered Genocide from Sadam so I am not defending the tyrant 
Two evils don't make one good my hate
2965 2018-08-01 17:19:14 I’ve taken up oil lately since carriages have become to readily available and today’s flavor, Jelly Beans, is making my day so sweet
2966 2018-08-01 17:19:06 but i dont have any olive oil
2967 2018-08-01 17:19:04 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
2968 2018-08-01 17:18:49 1648 BDM -BTN signal checked for no good reason at Windmil Bridge Junction. 1807 Oil can delayed behind it.
2969 2018-08-01 17:18:48 Most money doesn’t get into this accounting.  It is taken before it is accounted for. Zakho custom point only brings in $15 billion a year. If you add up oil revenue it is more than enough. I do agree central govt has reduced it but what krg has is more than enough if not stolen.
2970 2018-08-01 17:18:44 Bitterness from a lifetime of carrying a dickie doo.
2971 2018-08-01 17:18:41 Esp the celebs. People like Javed Akhtar is promoting Ortho oil and Divya Dutta Eye drop Sanjivani.
Do they know side effects? How on Earth can they promote quackary and ask people to take them?
If Dhoni coaxed people to buy Amrapali using his charm, he is a culprit too.
2972 2018-08-01 17:18:39 try a peppermint halo roll- on essential oil (from @SajeWellness ) if you can.  It works wonders
2973 2018-08-01 17:18:37 I have relatively dry skin, though, so I don't think this would be useful to anyone with oily or combo skin, and you've gotta let the oil sink in for like 20 minutes, so it's not great if you're in a rush like I usually am 
2974 2018-08-01 17:18:31 I STAY GETTING OIL STAINS ON MY FUCKING CLOTHES GODDAMN DES DO BETTER U FUCK ASS
2975 2018-08-01 17:18:28 How about they try using air fryers? Would cut cost on buying oil also!!
2976 2018-08-01 17:18:26 Yes They are doing more drilling in British Columbia and oil tankers or using that area more more which is running the habitat for the killer whales the 75 Whales will soon be gone
2977 2018-08-01 17:18:10 But those logical beings that actually read party platforms and see the true nature and character of each candidate- they wouldn't be voting to keep big oil and big pharma rich, they'd want a power source that is renewable. We'd be saved from humans who vote poorly- Trump, Ford..
2978 2018-08-01 17:18:09 It cost me $4 to top off everything, added in with the oil change package for $30
2979 2018-08-01 17:18:04 Yes, there is a difference. You can not "consume" water, because it is part of a cycle. You can reuse it again and again after a relatively short amount of time. Oil, on the other hand can be consumed, because it takes incredible long times to form new oil.
2980 2018-08-01 17:18:02 and 2) Those that claim to be “big thinkers” but make up crap to suit their agenda based on zero evidence, facts, logic or common sense
2981 2018-08-01 17:17:32 Ha ha grow fewer plants Tommy. Courgette Parmigiana is nice, swapping courgettes for aubergine. Or just slice and grill, brushed with olive oil, a little dried oregano, salt and pepper and serve with tzatziki and warm ciabatta. There are more complex recipes out there!
2982 2018-08-01 17:17:31 Na unable we go flush out like chronic decease! You these jobless thieves that think Niger Deltan oil is for una family
2983 2018-08-01 17:17:17 .. and extract that "essential" oil.
#Bokoवाषणा
2984 2018-08-01 17:17:06 Yes for me n you but in 2013 subsidy was 43k crore n in election year more than 123 lak cr as  vote catcher.Not paid  import bills to Iran for oil imported in 2013..2014..

Read carefully..this amount of roughly 63000 cr paid by Modi Govt..

2986 2018-08-01 17:16:42 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
2987 2018-08-01 17:16:37 I don't know about other people, but I use WAY less if I wash my face and rub 3 drops of rosehip oil in first, then moisturizer and foundation. I use way more without the oil, and even more if I use primer.
2988 2018-08-01 17:16:37 Bit of jealousy there, methinks.
2989 2018-08-01 17:16:33 I don’t know :/ I think it’s just Texas marijuana laws and he didn’t check my forms until now. I’m going to quit smoking at least until I get relief in my leg/back. I can always buy CBD oil for my stomach issues
2990 2018-08-01 17:16:25 Getting an oil change and had a spot of coffee while I wait and tbh I shouldn’t have done that like I know better I just like the taste of coffee but I’m shaking and I only had a small half cup.

2992 2018-08-01 17:16:06 I understand if you are vegan, but why choose manufactured food with stablizers, thickeners, preservatives over a simple mayo of egg, oil, mustard and vinegar.
2993 2018-08-01 17:16:04 this lady is tweaking about the jiffy lube people vacuuming her car as if it’s not included in the charge for her oil change.. u good sister lmfao

2995 2018-08-01 17:15:55 Meanwhile US gives puppet slave state, Columbia, billions and takes all the coke they can make. Uses Columbians to steel Venezuela's money and food, and drive away their oil revenues. Globalist takedown for oil, minerals, install Rothschilds banks, saving the petrodollar. Sick !
2996 2018-08-01 17:15:50 And then there's people who make wild assumptions from no proof whatsoever. I believe you and will are of the latter category. If you want to make a point, maybe try backing it up with something other than "extrapolating from incomplete data" 
2997 2018-08-01 17:15:39 Every Jew and Christian should demand a REFERENDUM. Nigeria was amalgamated for British govt resources control,(oil and gas) 1914 to 2014. Nigeria has expired. DEMAND FOR DOCUMENTS. HEBREW BIAFRA AND BRITISH GOVT.HAVE IT.

3000 2018-08-01 17:15:29 You can't call yourself a serious government and have people like dalung and shittu in your cabinet. It's oil and water
3001 2018-08-01 17:15:22 Although I do know he is usually selling snake oil. He’s just more intelligent in his remarks.

It's the world's only fresh, wild caught & raw #codliveroil - with all naturally occurring vitamins A, D and a full spectrum of #omegafattyacids . We appreciate you and your peeps  ; )
3009 2018-08-01 17:14:41 Clear signals as far as the oil can.
3010 2018-08-01 17:14:39 Not too versed on Venezuela, but wasn’t Venezuela once an extremely wealthy country? Huge oil reserves? Why hasn’t there been a civil war? Why haven’t those people taken back control of their country?
3011 2018-08-01 17:14:33 just got a phone poll asking about my favorability of the oil and gas industry, regulations, and corporations. also asked about my opinion on Republicans Cory Gardner and Walker Stapleton. #copolitics

3018 2018-08-01 17:13:57 We are in active combat in 7 nations and have a proxy war ongoing in Africa. He has destabilized Iran by breaking the deal which they were complying with. If he moves to block oil export routes, the odds of a major offensive greatly increase as Iran will be forced to retaliate
3019 2018-08-01 17:13:55 I literally cannot count the ways the oil and gas industry has personally inconvenienced me but I am so goddamn sick of these sand trucks going 20mph and always wrecking!!! I just wanna get home!!!
3020 2018-08-01 17:13:53 My husband works for a world leading Oil & Gas firm, they invest heavily in R&D from their own labs through to PHD students, all in pursuit of the next big technological break-through. Exploration companies are at the forefront to find a replacement to fossil fuels.

3022 2018-08-01 17:13:47 Doubletree Anaheim Orange: The server was accommodating albeit a bit baffled by my request of no oil/butter. Steamed asparagus side was fine. Custom steamed vegetable side (butternut squash, brussels sprouts, carrots) was swimming in some kind of fat but was kindly re-made. #WFPB

Adding kitchen bouquet to water & sausage doesn't make it gumbo, neither does cooking scrambled eggs in vegetable oil.

3031 2018-08-01 17:12:54 I remember reading an article in an oil industry magazine, Hydrocarbon Processing’ that dealt with climate change/global warming before those terms were coined. This was between 1975 and 1979.

3038 2018-08-01 17:12:34 Buying 10 warrants today in 2018 at $0.015 controls 1 Share at $1.05 in 2022.
You are buying 50 cents barrels in the ground and lifting them to surface in 2022 to be sold at $100 or more. So 15 Cents today controls $1.05 in 2022. If oil hits $100 you could earn 10X or more 4 yrs

3043 2018-08-01 17:11:34 Ok and there's irrefutable proof that whoever sent her this dm is a part of "the left" as big man Will so eloquently declared? You guys have no logical ground to stand on, but continue on.
3044 2018-08-01 17:11:24 I'm here because I have a genuine interest in CBD oil.
3045 2018-08-01 17:11:21 Oh my lord,
This is completely unacceptable. They are killing children now. What has this country become? I served my country for this?

3047 2018-08-01 17:11:16 I just got an oil change on my car like in the middle of June, and now here I am again.
3048 2018-08-01 17:11:09 The @RBI hiked Repo Rate to 6.50% while retaining its neutral monetary stance Output Gap, GDP Growth, Crude Oil Price & Inflation are likely the basis for #RBI decision to hike rates This is good because it gives stability to  ₹ & control inflation #RBIPolicy #MonetaryPolicy

3050 2018-08-01 17:10:56 The real question is how other car manufacturers and the oil industry are going to bury Tesla.
3051 2018-08-01 17:10:50 Deals regarding border control, immigration, crime, industry, trade, oil, etc. Seems that it would benefit both countries, Instead of shutting the opportunity out.

3053 2018-08-01 17:10:40 Ok anyone volunteering to buy me body oil I'll take it 
3054 2018-08-01 17:10:40 Because making it harder for solar power to compete with gas, oil, and coal is "owning the libs", and totally not because it's a favor to the GOP's corporate sponsors.
3055 2018-08-01 17:10:37 It’s really simple tho lol 
Pull the Plug let the oil drain into a pan

3063 2018-08-01 17:09:36 "Oil can"? Do you mean the finely crafted example of engineering and design that is the totally reliable class 171 diesel unit?
3064 2018-08-01 17:09:35 I haaaaaaate getting my oil changed alone lmao
3065 2018-08-01 17:09:03 I was writing an article for my part-time job about why I use coconut oil for massage and I learned something new... that coconut oil can help remove cellulite?  Ladies, how cool is that!  Might have to go digging and see if that pans out with further research.
3066 2018-08-01 17:08:59 Who cares, that doesn't stop a sensible consumer in buying Tesla, silent, electric and automated future car. Trump has his pockets filled with crude oil and crude oil doesn't clean easy.

3071 2018-08-01 17:08:26 I think it's more a matter of reflection, but yes, choppy versus calm waters make a difference. 

As to why there's such variations in the water surface, that can depend on wind, whether there's oil or surfactants on the water from a boat passing, etc.
3072 2018-08-01 17:08:21 Bakkour: ISIS led to US/Russian intervention, and paved way for Assad's capture of Deir Ezzor from ISIS - giving them control of oil fields. This pattern seen in other parts of Syria to weaken early support for FSA rebels. #SyriaConf2018

3083 2018-08-01 17:06:54 @RepRobBishop Don't want to hear what your constituents have to say?  OUr Western states are precious.  We want our public lands protected from mining, drilling and deforestation.  And protect our Pacific ocean from oil drilling which will upset the balance and kill.

3088 2018-08-01 17:06:17 @ICE hasn't performed. The VA either. The massive DC machine is a 1982 Chevy 1/2 ton pickup that leaks oil. The Congress rigged the system when they figured out how to stop the FBI from arresting corrupt members of Congress. The ICE foot solders are fine.

3099 2018-08-01 17:05:07 I’m not bringing up one issue. John was the one that (wrongly) said Scotland had no deficit. As for oil and gas taxation, Swinney pleaded for oil companies to be given tax breaks. And we still get more back than we pay in the form of fiscal transfer.

Get him out the paint ASAP
3115 2018-08-01 17:03:15 I am shorting oil because of demand, not supply.  Any further increase in oil will crash the global economy.  I believe it already started having a negative impact. So if cushing spikes WTI then get ready for an epic collapse. Btw, Iran benefits the higher oil goes.

3143 2018-08-01 17:01:17 As Jason McQuinn(Modern Slavery) and others would argue slavery simply changed form due to the power a barrel of oil and other accelerated factors. Beyond that, where's the talk of the abolition of work in 'emancipatory' discourse? #emancipationday

3155 2018-08-01 17:00:19 Great news - but it also reminds me just how rich oil producing nations can be. Odd then isn't it that good 'ol mug-Britain has been an oil-producer for half a century but we are somehow still wondering where all those (presumably) trillions went to.

3165 2018-08-01 16:59:52 I know you are kidding but...this is simply about the oil industry. Same reason that the Admin is suddenly concerned about all the birds dying in wind turbines.

3169 2018-08-01 16:59:35 Excellent, thank you! This is a very big story in Russia. The Wagner private military company (mercenaries) is the same one that lost ~300 people attacking a Kurdish oil field and US base in Syria and is owned by the same guy who ran the Internet Research Agency (troll factory).

Sure makes a difference
3188 2018-08-01 16:57:36 If 1-2m bpd of Iranian exports get taken off the market I do not know what will happen. I do not think Russia and Saudi pumping at full capacity can replace that. So be careful with oil as we get closer to November.
3189 2018-08-01 16:57:34 One at time, let me see who eats tuna, bread, oil, milk, list goes on daily? Their diet has already changed. I'm discussing how it could be improved. Like solar...if you don't have power people flocking to buy solar products now regardless of cost or quality.
3190 2018-08-01 16:57:30 i need to go get an oil change and register for my classes but i don’t wanna go by myself 
3191 2018-08-01 16:57:20 I probably should have checked the Rover's oil capacity BEFORE draining the oil. Disaster averted thankfully, but I had to whip the sump plug back in pretty sharpish!

3196 2018-08-01 16:57:01 When society becomes extremely unequal, elites tend to gain enough power to use the government to secure artificial advantages that shield them from competition...

Like Pharma making sure that the government protects its ability to charge anything for pharmaceuticals or big oil

3205 2018-08-01 16:56:19 Hi SuzieQ. I'm sorry about that. The stores should be cleaning those about once a month. That said, it is still safe to use these beans as it is just oil and debris from previous beans. I'd like to reach out to the store, though. Could you let me know which one it is?
3206 2018-08-01 16:56:11 The wars are endless, we enable a famine in Yemen instead of end them like we did in Ethiopia. Big oil, big pharma, and big energy run the government along with the NRA and military industrial complex. Nothing is real. Media is a joke and certainly not a friend of the people.

3208 2018-08-01 16:55:58 They could have changed the recipe to not require animal testing. A product is NOT vegan if any part of it has been tested on animals. The points about palm oil and almonds are valid. The issue is the the IB is hypocritical because it is advertised as vegan, but tests on aminals.

3210 2018-08-01 16:55:37 It needs to be said that had previous administrations invested in capital expenditure and with higher oil revenue as President @MBuhari administration, Nigeria would have made more progress in infrastructural development.

3211 2018-08-01 16:55:30 Wow, @Wolfiesmom puts oil on everything!  I don't think all this grilling would be good for my Adkins diet
3212 2018-08-01 16:55:21 Every time I take my car for an oil change I get scammed but they don’t try selling us any extra unnecessary service when my dad takes it in for me. But yeah, please continue to tell me that women are treated equal to men.
3213 2018-08-01 16:55:15 There’s no such thing as “Russian gas”.  Gas, oil, gold, wheat, copper, all commodities are traded, bought, and sold on the Global market. Trump doesn’t understand that we live in a Global market.

3217 2018-08-01 16:54:50 Also remember that in the 2014-2016 period there was a dramatic fall in investments in oil exploration and extraction. All of this is now coming back to haunt the market. Do a google on Brazil's pre-salt reserves. The whole thing has been nearly stopped.
3218 2018-08-01 16:54:48 Congrats @SeloSlav & @KyleTrouble. Nothing beats Croatian olive oil. Can it be bought in retail in Zagreb?
3219 2018-08-01 16:54:47 Oil Prices fell about 1 percent as a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and growing OPEC production fed worries that global supplies could swell, while investors continued to worry that trade tensions could hit energy demand

3223 2018-08-01 16:54:24 You read that I said that the AB economy collapsing? Hmmm... selective reading & interpretation? You're better than that. AB oil has contributed massively to the Canadian economy for decades! Federal Liberal anti-Canadian oil policies continues to destroy Canada's economy!

3246 2018-08-01 16:52:17 Below 18mb in inventory it causes pressure issues in the tanks and pipes. Someone will have to bid up the WTI contract to bring barrels into it. And you do not want to be in a way of any kind of shortage in oil as people will really pay anything.
3247 2018-08-01 16:52:06 Cool, so when we kick you out of NAFTA and put tariffs on your lumber, oil, etc. then you'll be happy? Obviously you want relations between our countries to be severed.

3275 2018-08-01 16:48:48 @jimmy_dore could this be a sign that we could go to war with Iran soon since their economy is going to collapse due to the US control of oil!

3277 2018-08-01 16:48:30 OPEC is noticing the downward trend in global oil inventories and they have moved to increase supply. They also do not want a price spike.
3278 2018-08-01 16:48:20 Thank you to all who visited our booth at the Cass County Fair! Congrats to the winners of our drawing for the free oil change! Our lucky winners were James Klar, Katie Kelly, Tim Olsen, and Lana Coatney.
3279 2018-08-01 16:48:19 *RUSSIA JULY OIL OUTPUT WAS 40.54K B/D BELOW OCT. 2016 LEVEL

that's straight on back to 11.2?  wow.  back to the highs.
3280 2018-08-01 16:48:14 Honestly terrified that my car is going to stall because I need an oil change but don’t have $100 to drop :)
3281 2018-08-01 16:48:13 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 2) IMO smart move is to open US Factories to assemble Smartphone+Tablets & 80% US components w/ 3D Robotic Systems & Solar,Wind,Hydrogen, Battery,etc. Energies as well as Oil,Gas,Coal,Nuclear, but we don't have the talent. Congress is clueless & corrupt.

3285 2018-08-01 16:47:50 I use the Baobab oil as a body moisturizer and I love it. 
3286 2018-08-01 16:47:42 Remember that the weekly inventory report has several components and some are volatile. The US imports and exports oil. So there will be fluctuations. This is why you need to look at the trend.
3287 2018-08-01 16:47:37 Between oil price collapse and CIA plots to destroy the economy and support coups against a democratically elected government, running Venezuela not easy.
3288 2018-08-01 16:47:25 Trim that shit and get some sandalwood beard oil. Prob solved and your self confidence will rise knowing your face smells of sexy man juice :)

3290 2018-08-01 16:46:55 You are only looking at this week. In general over the last 12 months inventories have been coming down. What matters is the trend and now US oil inventories are below the 5 year average. This is why oil went from low 50s to high 60s in the last 12m.
3291 2018-08-01 16:46:42 keep the disingenuous takes coming!

3305 2018-08-01 16:44:54 My wife and I are pregnant with our 4th child and I’d like to get her an essential oil to reinvigorate some of the passion in our marriage. She’s in her 3rd trimester. Can you reccomend something?
3306 2018-08-01 16:44:46 If that is the case and there is so much production revised lower while demand is increasing,why aren't we seeing drawdowns in oil, gasoline, distillates every week?
3307 2018-08-01 16:44:34 Release your taxes and prove you’re not heavily invested in big oil and fracking. We’ve already seen you campaign for candidates who supported the pipeline.
3308 2018-08-01 16:44:33 The world has lived with 100+ oil for many years and everyone did OK. At the moment one can make the case that with all the debt the economy is weaker but we may just gravitate to 100 and people carry on.

3314 2018-08-01 16:43:54 Be careful, lots of garbage in there...
Main one is fish oil... if you want to die young its perfect.
Iron is second on that list, get rid of that shit.
Vitamin D pretty useless... for the rest I hope you tested for defficiencies first...
3315 2018-08-01 16:43:51 Our colorants both inside & outside of the diaper have been carefully assessed & tested for safety & have been proven safe for infants.  If this happens, the colors are safe & can be removed using baby oil and a soft cloth.
3316 2018-08-01 16:43:39 Haha OUCH!! Surprisingly didn't burn too bad by the looks/feels of things today. Once splashed sizzling hot oil all over my hand, might aswell have dunked it in myself. THAT was bad.
3317 2018-08-01 16:43:32 ไม่รู้อ่ะ ไม่หา ไม่รู้จะหาไง หาที่ไหนด้วย ไม่มีก็ไม่มีไง ก็อยู่แบบนี้ ก็ดีแล้ว
3318 2018-08-01 16:43:26 They didn't have a choice since OIL & GAS are the engines that fuel the Canadian economy! (No pun intended!)

3320 2018-08-01 16:43:13 Trump is an illegitimate president. We are living in a right-wing dystopia run by snake oil religion and crude oil oligarchs.
3321 2018-08-01 16:42:47 had oil reached $100 I can assure you that we would be talking about how to combat the global recession.

3326 2018-08-01 16:42:12 Oil should be where horses are in Texas
3327 2018-08-01 16:42:05 LBJ's prints are all over it at the highest executive level. JFK's reduction of the oil depletion allowance (pissed off Oilmen), him being one of the first Presidents since 1913 to print government backed money (pissed off the Rothschilds), and scaling back in Vietnam.
3328 2018-08-01 16:42:00 That’s a stretch. It’d be nice, but let’s not forget that the one and only reason Tillerson got the job was to ensure that sanctions against Russia were lifted so the proposed half-trillion dollar deal between Exxon and Rosneft (russian State-owned oil) could happen

3334 2018-08-01 16:41:11 #CrudeOil in the low 60's is not going to happen. Short lived imo. OPEC didn't put all this effort in production cuts to see oil in the low 60's. Looking for high 60's to low 70's. #OOTT
3335 2018-08-01 16:41:03 And pay attention that US oil production has been revised lower from 11m bpd to just under 10.5m bpd. These news came out yesterday. Then add Angola, Brazil, China and a few others missing production by 20-50k bpd and it starts to add up.
3336 2018-08-01 16:40:57 Immingham also supports thousands of jobs at ABP (Associated British Ports) with its Humber Oil Terminal.
Until there is a quick and valid alternative to oil. I would like to have asked how those Steel Workers including my neighbour planned on getting to work?

3347 2018-08-01 16:40:10 have you started using avocado oil instead of olive for cooking?  Higher flash point, oil doesn't breakdown during cooking.

Hint: do it.

3363 2018-08-01 16:38:28 Had OPEC just sat back and done nothing I can assure you that we would have oil trading over 100 this year as inventories have been declining for a while. Total US oil inventories have declined from around 500m barrels to near 400m now.
3364 2018-08-01 16:38:28 I rarely use any. When my beard is dry I'll use an oil (no real brand loyalty) and a boar brush. I try to keep the sides trimmed a bit too.

3372 2018-08-01 16:37:41 No surprise that the 4 industries singled out as being at risk are big business in Ontario and Quebec, I guess western based sectors such as oil and gas will continue to have to play by a different set of rules.
3373 2018-08-01 16:37:35 The truth sir - he is going to the hospital to enjoy free health care,food, and air travel - oil money with not one cent from cattle. How much compensation has he paid those killed by the Fulani herders only because they are Nigerians/and or christians? The truth sir.

3378 2018-08-01 16:37:09 One can speculate about future demand but it is a fact that all time high US demand for oil was just reached recently in June if I am not mistaken. Opec is pumping more to prevent a major price spike as inventories have been going lower for 12m+.
3379 2018-08-01 16:36:56 Bro you need a better quality fish oil. Check out Life Extensions or Nutrigold - can get up to 1000mg omega 3 per capsule.

3388 2018-08-01 16:36:05 I hear that a lot. 
These companies are looking for exact matches and unwilling to train people who are close to the qualifications. If the oil industry would invest in people, it would get much better returns.

3397 2018-08-01 16:34:59 Disclaimer: The joke was that if you pay Jimboman a negative amount of money, that means you make money without ever paying him.
3398 2018-08-01 16:34:20 But i don't think it can affect Dubai and Abu Dhabi's relations in the long term because they are still the biggest emirates in UAE and because ultimately Abu Dhabi bailed out Dubai in 2008/2009 and its oil money floats the country largely.
3399 2018-08-01 16:34:13 He's not a journalist. He's never done a single piece of investigative journalism his entire life. He's 100% a snake oil salesman.
3400 2018-08-01 16:34:03 OK...Then stay short....The issue is that even with weaker growth oil consumption is still rising (1bn+ people in China. 1bn+ in India, 1.1bn in Africa and so on).

3409 2018-08-01 16:33:12 Veterinary isn’t people but it obviously grants a heavy ego. Well I did my research and I am correct. A large portions of vaccines contain adjuvants and a large portion of adjuvants of derived from paraffin oil which is a petroleum product. So go double check your degrees.
3410 2018-08-01 16:33:01 Because Norway "Drills, Baby and Drills" for Oil!
3411 2018-08-01 16:32:47 No of course not. But 85 percent of calorie intake in the US comes from plants in the dorm of sugar, grain, and vegetable oil. The crops that make these are annuals that deplete the soil. I encourage you to read the vegetarian myth by Lierre Keith.
3412 2018-08-01 16:32:38 Sesame-Ginger Popcorn
Melt ¼ cup butter; stir in ½ teaspoon sesame oil, a splash of soy sauce and a pinch of ginger. Drizzle over 3½ quarts popcorn and toss. Add wasabi pea-rice cracker mix and honey-roasted peanuts. 
3413 2018-08-01 16:32:33 I just use straight up coconut oil from walmart in the cooking section and soak my roots n length but truee, lil flyaways always get fucked up, possibly some sort of hair wrap maybe?
3414 2018-08-01 16:32:32 Dada balo mai oil lgaya kro mza nhi aya aise.... तेल लगाओ डाबर का नाश मिटाओ बाबर का
3415 2018-08-01 16:32:21 The economic situation in China is worsening.  A deal with China would require major concessions.  I don't see how that would help oil now when US demand is falling and summer driving season is almost over.
3416 2018-08-01 16:32:18 I think you should go short oil then....
3417 2018-08-01 16:32:18 they are only pro-(insert identity group) if said group agrees with them.

3419 2018-08-01 16:32:05 Trying to adult this morning and take care of errands. 2 hour wait for oil change and I left my phone charger at home.  Tempted to make friends with the receptionist to borrow a charger to watch the yankees game. 
3420 2018-08-01 16:32:04 Today I feel like a grown up because I removed an oil stain from a green dress using swanky stain removal products.... it was probably slightly less grown up that I phoned my mum afterwards to tell her how well I had done!
3421 2018-08-01 16:31:58 Maybe ask TrumpPence and @GOP to stop opening them up for fracking and oil. Just a thought. If you dont do that then this means nothing
3422 2018-08-01 16:31:50 Holy fucking hell, this is a new level stupid. The chart needs data and the data comes from Stats Canada. No matter who made it, the data came from Stats Canada. And that data mimics US oil and gas employment. Go figure.
3423 2018-08-01 16:31:42 So much olive oil fraud out there - mixing cheaper oils in with EVOO. Do you buy certified, extra virgin olive oil?
3424 2018-08-01 16:31:33 more recently, working with EU to increase their purchases of LPG from US; which, is one of russia’s vital ways to make money. Oil is another and the US is the first or second largest oil supplier in the world. Trying to increase funding for NATO doesn’t help russia either.
3425 2018-08-01 16:31:23 Oh thats a good idea!! I'm going to try that tonight when i go to bed  i usually use a vanilla oil on their paws and chest

3434 2018-08-01 16:30:08 そこが大問題だ！！
3435 2018-08-01 16:30:06 That's inaccurate. Its when it's exploded on the backs of every1 4 the rich. Republicans have effed up the economy my whole lifetime. Hell even trump will tell u that.  Go buy that trickle down theory. Its on the shelf behind the snake oil.
3436 2018-08-01 16:30:05 No! You just leave them be until the start to loosen and you can use baby oil to start rubbing them off!
3437 2018-08-01 16:30:03 I believe that Trump said that we can both protect the environment while not losing jobs in coal, gas and oil.
I think... maybe he's focusing on the one side and not enough on the other? I am curious about your take.
3438 2018-08-01 16:30:02 I do not know. I guess they have to start paying some sort of premium on WTI to bring more oil into Cushing.
3439 2018-08-01 16:29:55 Same question - if we are drilling more why are we not building more refineries? 
Why keep sending out to process then we have to buy

3442 2018-08-01 16:29:46 I think all plastic bottles are a problem. You can buy BPA-free, but it seems to be just as disruptive to the body. Plus, the oils themselves, like soybean oil, corn oil, have unhealthy fatty acid profiles. Too many omega-6's. Plus, the processing of the oils produces aldehydes.
3443 2018-08-01 16:29:38 coo coo for coconut oil...

3475 2018-08-01 16:26:30 "Quality" is just a euphemism for subservient in this instance.  They have to say quality because no one's going to vote for subservient.  That always how they do it.  A verbal version of smoke, mirrors, snake oil, find the lady and sleight of hand.

3535 2018-08-01 16:19:14 EIA - crude oil inventories rose by 3.8mn barrels last week. Analysts were expecting 2.8mn withdrawal. As a result, WTI futures down 1.4% to $67. Also poor quarterly results from Anadarko Petroleum & Devon Energy. $APC, $DVN down more than 5.5% each

3552 2018-08-01 16:17:22 A lot of oil from childhood, the Midland City, Kansas. That can't help were white Oldsmobile. The name of course—and his
3553 2018-08-01 16:17:18 YES! One would hope the CPC will grab hold of this and push it in the best interests of all Canadians, our soaring budget deficits, our social programs, and with a view to using good ol' Canadian oil instead of shipping tankers from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, et al!
3554 2018-08-01 16:17:13 Guessing this is pointed at Fleck and Campbell. Two guys that shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as Ferentz. They are both snake oil salesmen and are just looking for an actual P5 team to hire them.
3555 2018-08-01 16:17:11 Oh I know what it’s about. A bunch of tin-foil wearing, conspiracy buying, whack-a-doos, who pour snake oil down their throats by the gallon.
3556 2018-08-01 16:17:06 yes coconut oil is amazing!!! also just leaving conditioner on your hair for a while (like 15-30 minutes) will def help.  my hair is blonde so i totally understand the struggle.

3559 2018-08-01 16:16:39 French fries were half cooked. Pepsi was delivered after 45 minutes of order. Even burgers were not good. Oil used to cook the burgers very bed. It was smelling.
3560 2018-08-01 16:16:37 Why?  Watch a rodeo on oil polluted dirt.

3568 2018-08-01 16:14:56 Opinions on CBD oil? (Only if you’ve actually tried it obviously) Has it helped you with any of your symptoms/illnesses or has it made any worse?
3569 2018-08-01 16:14:46 Just remember in 1980 scientists first brought to the table serious evidence of climate change and both political parties and the oil and gas industry were in agreement that something needed to be done and that the evidence was irrefutable. How did we get to this point?
3570 2018-08-01 16:14:41 Talk is slick like its oil speakin'
3571 2018-08-01 16:14:35 Ohh itu yang oil itu ya
3572 2018-08-01 16:14:12 "Sandwich oil" is a cringeworthy term that i never knew would make me physically cringe until just now.
3573 2018-08-01 16:14:12 Ici même quand tu prends « coconut oil massage », elle arrive à te démonter à la thaï 
3574 2018-08-01 16:14:03 Yay :) added a little olive oil on tava so bread crisps up
3575 2018-08-01 16:13:52 If you would like a coupon you may use on an oil change, we may certainly send one to you.
3576 2018-08-01 16:13:49 Interesting question about the corporate class.

I'm mainly going from a kinesthetic gut here. This is where a lot of my thoughts begin, I just expressed it much earlier than usual.

Younger generations + #ecoright + conservative contractors + gas/oil wanting carbon pricing = ?
3577 2018-08-01 16:13:32 All in an effort to protect themselves from $50 oil and yet they are now losing money on the hedge. These companies are getting no breaks, this bear market has been brutal. I bet you now that they reduce hedging exposure the oil price will fall and screw them once again.
3578 2018-08-01 16:13:27 minimal brushing. minimal heat use. hair oil when hair is wet. use a hair mask of some kind once a week or so. be kind 2 ur locks. thats about all i got ahahaha. and mine's still a mess.
3579 2018-08-01 16:12:16 Ah that will be why the lorry is still here lol. Thanks Pete .

3581 2018-08-01 16:12:09 its not ice cream its a “frozen dairy dessert”. it goes great with “pasteurized cheese product” and “hydrogenated vegetable oil spread”
3582 2018-08-01 16:11:58 Didn't Fonald Rump try and go after Qatar for money and oil right into his presidency
3583 2018-08-01 16:11:45 "Trump launches extraordinary attack on Koch brothers after oil tycoons refuse to back Republican candidate" - That's our Nazi president!  With this dictator, it's his way or no way. AND IT'S THE REPUBLICANS FAULT! They should have impeached him LONG ago! #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow

3586 2018-08-01 16:11:28 If you are talking about the oil and gas employment chart, that’s oil and gas employment. It’s sourced by Stats Canada. The guy making the chart isn’t creating his own data. You know that, right?

3589 2018-08-01 16:11:11 Won't be as good as he was during the 2016-17 campaign but fully expect Talbot to have a bounce-back performance in 2018-19. Have said since the back half of the 2015-16 season that Cam was a top 10ish goalie (somewhere through 7-12) and stand by that statement. #Oilers
3590 2018-08-01 16:11:08 Any garri is meet for making eba. Yellow garri is yellow because palm oil was added to alleviate Vit. A deficiency. Cassava requires extensive preparation to decrease its level of cyanogenic glucosides, which can be fatal.
3591 2018-08-01 16:11:00 Yay! The perfect oil for the upcoming season!
3592 2018-08-01 16:10:49 No need to squat, I own a home.  Worked in AB in oil industry for many years and moved west.  But sure, I’ll wait out here in beautiful BC until an Alberta?  tells me to come out east again
3593 2018-08-01 16:10:31 lovely to see...thank you.
3594 2018-08-01 16:10:25 Spray with a lil oil and oven. It’s slightly healthier. Though I don’t know if this is actually true.

3602 2018-08-01 16:09:22 recently - the oil rig thing they did for Necromunda. I think there are probably quite a lot - most of the 40k displays at WHW are good.
3603 2018-08-01 16:09:21 Is olive oil ok? Which oils should be used in cooking?
3604 2018-08-01 16:09:16 Try an oil based makeup remover if it’s really stained
3605 2018-08-01 16:09:09 You quote yourself as proof of? Sounds like you have a smocking gun, lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist. #magats
3606 2018-08-01 16:08:56 Unless we find billions and/or some oil I wouldn’t bother
3607 2018-08-01 16:08:56 Not only is CO's "think before you sign petitions" campaign v patronizing, it's also funded by OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY advocacy groups.
3608 2018-08-01 16:08:55 Changed the oil in June
3609 2018-08-01 16:08:52 WTI price is $67.00...   there is ZERO reason why gas should be 1.26... let alone 1.49... don't give in to the oil companies attempted physiological mind games here!  #Alberta
3610 2018-08-01 16:08:31 Of course, I also pour off the separated oil before the initial stir, which means (a) fewer runny sandwiches, (b) easier first stir, (c) peanut oil for stir fries. But also, more chance of too-hard unstirred layer at the bottom of the container.

3612 2018-08-01 16:08:15 NEVER put CBD oil in your ecig. Even if it says you can, even if workers say you can, don’t. It’ll burn your shit UP.
3613 2018-08-01 16:08:00 RETWEET if you’re proud of how Texas oil and gas production is improving America’s economy!
3614 2018-08-01 16:07:38 they sold their oil rights.

3619 2018-08-01 16:07:27 We've been propping up the most profitable industry in human history, the oil companies, for decades.  Why?  I've never heard a good reason as to why the oil industry needs my tax dollars when they're rolling in money from raping my planet.
3620 2018-08-01 16:07:24 Westminster has never cared about scots as long as the steal our oil and pay our tax that all that matters to them
3621 2018-08-01 16:07:20 I worked a sidejob in a moose oil factory.
3622 2018-08-01 16:07:17 A bag of potatoes is only a few bucks then canola oil is like around 3 or 4 then salt is really cheap so I mean you're not really paying that much and you're getting a better quality, better for your health (because there are no chemicals and shit) product.

3633 2018-08-01 16:05:40 I have been to a doctor, asked for other alternatives than prescriptions & he didn’t really have any to recommend so I did my own research & I take CBD oil, it’s changed my moods, my energy levels, helped me think clearly in stressful times. It’s definitely changed my life.
3634 2018-08-01 16:05:34 Our local oil production doesn't meet our demand. We have oil & gas reservoirs, but not enough. We can go & extract new reserves in Baluchistan & Waziristan, but security concerns are there.

3640 2018-08-01 16:04:42 Government policies are anti-Canadian oil, yet they get billions of dollars from it. Until there is change in Ottawa, this DESTRUCTION will continue. The economy is grinding down to a halt & wouldn't be surprised to see a recession soon. But @JustinTrudeau will borrow billions!
3641 2018-08-01 16:04:38 I think it art. Like oil paint
3642 2018-08-01 16:04:32 Not likely. Oil and gas production is very tied to their market prices. And that is controlled by many forces outside of the control of any Kansan or shifts in the electric generation world.
3643 2018-08-01 16:04:08 Ugh. Why do you want to club Mallus with those ugly paandis from across the border? They don’t even bathe! And when they do, they put hair oil AFTER they bathe!

We would be relegated before Roman gets to see how backward Chelsea have gone.

3661 2018-08-01 16:01:22 Bernie - Norway has a total population of 5.3Million people - they also have large oil reserves which allows them to hold $178,000 per citizen in a trust - easy to pay for medical when in a cash positive position - it’s called economics 101 - you & @DNC should study the concept
3662 2018-08-01 16:01:20 @SquawkAlley why NOT Bash BIG OIL for decades of American consumer price gouging, costing taxpayers trillions in WAR spending, colluding with terrorist, and bribing Congress to create laws that kill their renewable energy competition

3675 2018-08-01 16:00:03 When used oil comes to your  rescue.
3676 2018-08-01 15:59:49 สิ่งที่ได้เรียนรู้จากการทำงานวันนี้ คือ คนเรามองเห็นความผิดพลาดของคนอื่นยกเว้นตัวเอง จะโทษทุกสิ่ง ทั้งทีตัวเองสะเพร่าเองแท้ๆ
3677 2018-08-01 15:59:46 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
3678 2018-08-01 15:59:39 Sealing my hair with oil after styling has helped my hair so much. I can get like 2-3 days out of my curls 
3679 2018-08-01 15:59:24 Can you use fuel as engine oil.
3680 2018-08-01 15:59:22 Healthy chicken and chips tea with my girls. Cajun baked chicken breast, sweet potato fries in coconut oil, peas, beans and spinach.
3681 2018-08-01 15:59:21 My advise to @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial  To save 3-4 billion dollars every year,we need to build a big refinery so that we stop importing refined products,we should buy raw product(crude) and refine it ourself,oil mafia is very strong,hope khan sab can control them
3682 2018-08-01 15:59:21 Fossil fuels are not the right way to protect Colorado.  Reducing the harmful impacts of oil and gas production--including climate change and birth defects--is.  Stop spreading propaganda.
3683 2018-08-01 15:58:55 Pakistan is a mini US of NAM which has way too much oil reserves that they do not disclose.  This is done to keep the USD relevant and control oil prices and the Saudies under control.  They can make the sheikhs insolvent very easily at will.  They almost succeed in case of UAE!
3684 2018-08-01 15:58:50 This would be interesting to know and kindly also include the free oil we get yearly from Saudia after nuclear testing.
And what if we buy oil from Iran that will be good for both countries if it is necessary to buy 
3685 2018-08-01 15:58:45 bro its about Indian Policy about Iran's sanctions 
because India is the biggest iranian oil importer 
and India is the regional gate keaper of America in south aAsia now USA restrict to India to contineue their trade with Iran.........so this artical about indian forigen policy
3686 2018-08-01 15:58:29 Is crude oil also going to crash ??

3706 2018-08-01 15:55:31 Lol. Alberta's economy is great. Best in Canada. Lowest taxes in Canada. Some people haven't recovered when the oil boom went bust. That's unfortunate. But that's the nature of boom and bust industries.
3707 2018-08-01 15:55:30 Drink some good ass tea and ingest some hemp oil
3708 2018-08-01 15:55:27 Since the NDP formed government we have gone through a recession due to oil price crash. How do the ratios compare year by year?
3709 2018-08-01 15:54:54 I forgot to bring my mint bubblegum-flavored charcoal toothpaste, and had to use my brother’s which has this mixture of clove oil and tea tree oil as the ingredients. It was utterly disgusting.

3714 2018-08-01 15:54:30 The thing is Scotland could be a viable country on its own without North Sea Oil! The question is, why are we still tied to Westminster??
3715 2018-08-01 15:54:25 Ahh no, my best friend gets those :( 

Do you take cannabis oil or anything similar? That always helped him

3717 2018-08-01 15:54:17 Have you tried peppermint and lavender oil on the temples and above the eyebrows, then rub it in? It sounds dumb but it's helped me during my worst migraines.
3718 2018-08-01 15:54:00 @SenMarkey Thank you for standing up at the hearing today against Wheeler and @realDonaldTrump. Clean air should Trump big oil business. #CleanEnergy #CleanerCars #StopEPARollbacks

@EPAAWheeler: "Yes"
#WheelerHearing
3721 2018-08-01 15:53:51 .@SenMarkey is pressing @EPAAWheeler on big oil influence on American consumer under current standards and freezing standards at 2020 levels. Scott Pruitt committed to releasing toxic report on formaldehyde; will you release it b/c Pruitt did not. Mr. Wheeler is reviewing this.
3722 2018-08-01 15:53:48 中国語では「頑張れ」を「加油」といって、文字通り「ガソリン（つまりエネルギー）を入れて頑張れ」みたいな意味らしいのですが、香港の友達に「今から仕事なんだ」とメッセージを送ったら「Add oil for work!」と返されて、これは広東エリアのスラングだと教わりました。いい表現だから使いたいね。
3723 2018-08-01 15:53:47 .@SenMarkey telling it like it is: "#CleanerCars standards rollback is about oil -- it's oil above all else."

#WheelerDealer EPW hearing sheds light on what we stand to lose under this rollback: health and climate protections and consumer savings.

3725 2018-08-01 15:53:23 All workers are taxpayers and public sector work is just as valuable as private sector work. Don't try that ruse again. Not only does the oil industry get many subsidies, it creates huge environmental externalities. (look up the term if you don't understand it).

3728 2018-08-01 15:52:59 More than offset by gas price increases triggered by you pulling out of the Iran deal. By the way, Putin benefits from an increase in oil prices, right?
3729 2018-08-01 15:52:58 Impressive questioning from @SenMarkey to @EPAAWheeler about our #cleancarstandards being rolled back to benefit #oil companies and harm our health. #wheelerdealer
3730 2018-08-01 15:52:57 Hi there! We don't add salt, but it is whipped with olive oil which could add a savoury note. There is a small amount of salt in the granola, however. Thanks for bringing this up, we'll look into it!
3731 2018-08-01 15:52:49 Even though the RBI continues to maintain a ‘Neutral’ stance, I believe it will be on hold for now unless higher-than-anticipated upside risks to inflation from crude oil, stronger demand conditions and food prices materialise. #RBIPolicy

By the way, the oil industry that you are so proud of is KILLING OUR PLANET!

3735 2018-08-01 15:52:25 Yes this is a big mafia that does not allow us to build a big refinery so that we start refining oil ourself and only import crude and that also from Iran to reduce transportation cost
3736 2018-08-01 15:52:16 Go change your car's oil, smh.
3737 2018-08-01 15:52:13 Nothing a little anointing oil can't remedy....
3738 2018-08-01 15:52:04 The Sea Point KFC tastes terrible - like burnt oil.  Twice in a row, two months apart, my double crunch was disgusting, burnt and smoke flavoured.   I would like those burgers replaced please.
3739 2018-08-01 15:51:56 so my corporate big wig boss sent an email today discussing how tariffs and “tax cuts” has hurt pretty much every one in the auto industry. from higher oil and fluid costs to lower revenues and higher insurance rates for shops. and to “hang tough” because it will get better.
3740 2018-08-01 15:51:51 I didn’t realize my car is two months over due for an oil change no wonder my car is feeling funny 
3741 2018-08-01 15:51:24 i don't have this particular product from them, but i've got a bunch of their other stuff (salicylic acid, azaelic acid, vitamin c, 30% aha peel, rosehip seed oil) & they're all excellent quality for the price

3749 2018-08-01 15:50:47 Saudi seldom offered grants - their most effective of favouring us, is either delayed payment or converting the oil price to gift and the gift proven more costly than anything else
3750 2018-08-01 15:50:35 .@SenMarkey is addressing big oil industry and rollbacks by Trump of standards in oil industry. Koch Bros and Trump always agree on petroleum "oil above all." Trump rollback: #1 option is freezing standards at 2020 levels. Do you agree freezing leaves to more oil being consumed?
3751 2018-08-01 15:50:31 Got my oil changed, my tires rotated, and my car washed yesterday. I feel happy.

3771 2018-08-01 15:48:11 The NATO countries need to start living up to their commitments.  This administration has sold weapons to Ukraine.  Yours didn't.  This president has knocked Germany for buying oil from Russia. Your former boss did not. Your troll act isn't working.

3773 2018-08-01 15:48:01 Oil and gas wants carbon pricing to ease regulatory burden... one of the few pieces of common ground.

Cap and dividend was originally a conservative proposal in the 80s IIRC. 

I'm a centrist, I'm surprised by my feeling here too. Either way, if it gets done, do you care?
3774 2018-08-01 15:47:38 ...is coming along and may have the Iranian President Visiting the US. All this would have NEVER happened under the narcissistic BO!

3798 2018-08-01 15:44:32 This is the part that cracks me up about Trump supporters. Trump has never bought groceries, done a load of laundry or changed his own oil but somehow they feel that he relates to them as a non elitist. They sure are easily suckered.

3822 2018-08-01 15:41:59 We do not produce huge amount of local oil,if the oil is light it is processed by local refineries and if the oil is heavy it is sold outside.most of our oil is imported

3833 2018-08-01 15:40:48 Dude, my Mom now uses oil that is 1 part CBD and 7 parts THC. It really helps her with the pain from 2 failed back surgeries. It really is a miracle weed.

3835 2018-08-01 15:40:36 Those plastics don’t work very well at being impermeable to oxygen. These would be even better than oil based plastics which would mean foods stay fresh longer. This means less food waste, and the plastic biodegrades so less ocean pollution, in turn saving WAYYY more ocean life

3843 2018-08-01 15:39:27 If you are an employee of Canary an oil drilling service, you should be very worried.  Your CEO believes that Trump never lies, and just quotes what he “remembers” and refused to say that he ever lies.  He is a donor to Trump and is lock step with him including for tariffs. Wow

3851 2018-08-01 15:38:05 @VelshiRuhle thanks for trying to get Dan dumbass to answer a simple question. However, we see he is evasive because he is bought for the big oil lobby. You really need to pick better guests that don't evade and lie.
3852 2018-08-01 15:37:51 That's for those folks that don't want to get Gun oil and residue on their clothes.
3853 2018-08-01 15:37:49 How can you provide locally produced cheap oil to private transport? Your oil import bill is US$10-12bn. Your local oil production is around 90k barrels per day which is 20% of your total demand. You import around 80% of oil demand.

3895 2018-08-01 15:33:32 If that's the basis, definitely not, but I think being called that by many presently is based on the notoriety that comes with making the Champions League spots in a league that has Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, and two oil clubs.

3908 2018-08-01 15:32:52 Oh man, that argument was produced by the oil industry and is not of science. A false narrative that has spread through social media. Much like big tobacco telling us that cigarettes do not increase the risk of cancer. Ur involved with & believe the corporate propaganda machine.

3923 2018-08-01 15:30:59 I think oil prices have changed to the bottom and are heading to 60.5. The reason is the trade war between America and China and Trump's attitude towards Iran exploratory and increasing oil pumping and the adoption of industrial indicators in China, Europe, America .

3951 2018-08-01 15:28:55 Because CNN isn’t reporting news that agrees with your preconceptions that Trump’s not a lying, unfaithful, cheating snake oil salesman doesn’t mean they’re the “fake news.” You’re just a child who can’t handle reality. Run along, young man. Back to Fox News you go.

3955 2018-08-01 15:28:41 So my car only takes synthetic oil which costs more money. Of course!
3956 2018-08-01 15:28:33 apparently it involve super heating oil in tge oven and then pour batter into the oil
i've sustained enouh burns to know me + hot oil = extreme pain

3958 2018-08-01 15:28:25 You can Cook them different ways too! Try frying them in oil, i know it’s not traditional but it’s good as fuck and the kind of chewy texture goes away
3959 2018-08-01 15:28:19 Did you know that using oil to heat your home will not create any negative odors, soot, or dirt in your home as long as it is properly taken care of?

3964 2018-08-01 15:27:53 Oil Mafia is the biggest scandal in our history of economic terrorism against Pakistan. 
Pakistan is an oil/gas producing country, floating on these resources....yet we import $billions worth & dont know where local petrol goes....Huge huge corruption scandal here. OGRA involved!

3985 2018-08-01 15:25:04 In Pakistan, only less than 10 % of oil is used for cars/private transport. 
90 % oil is used for industrial/commercial/defense purpose. Like producing power, airlines, military, Railways etc ...
We can actually provide FREE/Cheap locally produced oil to private transport ..
3986 2018-08-01 15:24:32 My coworkers always look at me like it’s against policy or some shit to come to work oiled up...

4046 2018-08-01 15:18:22 But if you must go down this path then just write down 5 things you like about yourself & 5 things you want to change, once you write them down it’s easier to conceptualize.  To me you’re perfect but you might need to change the oil in your car
4047 2018-08-01 15:18:06 I’d rather rip my lacefront off with no oil rather than listening to any of them perform live omfG

4058 2018-08-01 15:16:27 Should clarify that this is based on NUTS1 regions, so e.g. Scotland is taken as a whole (fiscal deficit: £2,698).  I suspect Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire have surpluses, Edinburgh does or is very close, and Shetland and Orkney depend on how you allocate oil between councils.
4059 2018-08-01 15:16:21 CBD Oil!!! Who is paying to much for their CBD oil? CBD Oil is used for a variety of reasons from pain management to seizures, Alzheimer’s, and eczema. Contact me to get the most potent (100ml), highest quality CBD oil with the best price!
4060 2018-08-01 15:16:20 Yes the clean peak standard is based on peak hours during each of the 4 seasons, most importantly summer/winter. Winter is the big problem for MA due to NG pipeline constraints and so much oil being burned
4061 2018-08-01 15:16:19 They also seem to be strip mining the earth. I watch #dutchsinse earthquake forecasts, and when he zooms in from google earth to where earthquake are happening in America, there are oil pumping operations everywhere.

4101 2018-08-01 15:10:37 Crude is getting up there, but the stats I've seen on oil production in the US are astounding. It's becoming more difficult to imagine a return to the 2007/8 or 2010/11 environment when so many US drillers are very profitable even at ~ $70.
4102 2018-08-01 15:10:32 That discussion can take the oil that, when we are bombing. Really fantastic. invitation by email. Then there’s my mother, Mary.

4104 2018-08-01 15:10:18 (copy pasted this lol)
The rice balls are made of:
Tuna, rice, some sesame oil, a dash of oyster sauce, flakes of dried seaweed, some salt and pepper
The meat is Dduk-galbee:
Korean meatloaf but smaller and more delicious
And lastly: Kimchi scallion mushroom onion Korean pancake!
4105 2018-08-01 15:10:16 I hoped it might end up there. Great breakfast/coffee cake, market yellow carrots and applesauce reduced the oil. And, made with Fin’s love.
4106 2018-08-01 15:10:15 Oh no ... I like Ford as well .. first car was a Ford escort loved that car . I just did not know it took oil ... things we learn
4107 2018-08-01 15:10:11 My dog has been the same way all summer. A tea spoon of vegetable oil on every bowl of food and a couple benydril a day help, along with a bath with anti itch shampoo every couple of weeks helps, but she's still pretty itchy.
4108 2018-08-01 15:10:08 Political loyalty is like a gun, you need to service and oil it time to time, if not, it will fail you when you need it most.
4109 2018-08-01 15:10:05 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
4110 2018-08-01 15:10:04 People keep asking me what my skincare routine is, so here you go: you take coconut oil and you slather your face in it. Then cry until the emotional trauma of your past leaks out onto your skin. 
There you go folks :)
4111 2018-08-01 15:09:52 Getting my oil changed on 1960
4112 2018-08-01 15:09:49 Blue smoke....burning oil?
4113 2018-08-01 15:09:15 Now I'm getting my oil changed lmao what a way to start off my month
4114 2018-08-01 15:09:01 $FANG should be  getting hit here.  all these stks had head fakes when oil tried to pop on a bad number.   The numbers reported today from $WLL $DVN $APC were not good
4115 2018-08-01 15:08:53 Hahaha the rice balls are made of:
Tuna, rice, some sesame oil, a dash of oyster sauce, flakes of dried seaweed, some salt and pepper

The meat is Dduk-galbee:
Essentially Korean meatloaf but smaller and more delicious

And lastly: Kimchi scallion mushroom onion Korean pancake!
4116 2018-08-01 15:08:42 I think ke batla go berekisa mala. But ka eng? Because I’m definitely not drinking Mist Alba or Castor Oil 
4117 2018-08-01 15:08:36 iraqi oil exports rise to 3.543  #oott
4118 2018-08-01 15:08:34 Bacon grease is the best essential oil..
4119 2018-08-01 15:08:20 I slept too late. Might have to take the car for it’s oil change tomorrow 
4120 2018-08-01 15:08:15 "Why are we experiencing the 6th straight week of rain in Virginia while California and Colorado are still fried chicken that sat in the oil too long?" Because the poles are melting and destabilizing jet streams, causing meanders of dramatic weather to be more widespread.

4124 2018-08-01 15:07:12 When dry, may I recommend WILKO DECKING OIL/Preservative for the decking. We use OAK colour and it gives a wonderful (ironically) non-oily rich coloured boards.
4125 2018-08-01 15:07:12 The oil is available in Australia now, although I hear it’s expensive
4126 2018-08-01 15:07:11 They know. He called it an "oil leak." So, they understand the language.

4131 2018-08-01 15:06:19 After helping my friends fix my car the other day I like really want to get down and dirty and clean all the oil gunk on the engine
4132 2018-08-01 15:06:16 Green tea & a few drops of the oil 
4133 2018-08-01 15:06:11 @JerryBrownGov it is unnacceptable to the people of CA to not have current DOGGR oil production data available!!!!!
4134 2018-08-01 15:06:05 Sounds like Camelina oil from a plant breed to have Omega3 oil in it. Fish are one of the more efficient users of feed, so if the growers get good yields on their camelina, it sounds like a potentially reasonable system, especially with over-fishing issues.
4135 2018-08-01 15:06:03 Girls if u want your eyelashes to grow put coconut oil and castor oil on them every night!! My lashes are acc about to fly me away
4136 2018-08-01 15:05:55 My dog used to get like that in the summer. I switched from dry food to canned and it helped a lot. I also read you can pour a little cooking oil on dry food.
4137 2018-08-01 15:05:48 مش لو لحقته
4138 2018-08-01 15:05:42 Why not just change the oil yourself?  Who the hell is taking a 9 year old car to the dealership for an oil change?!?
4139 2018-08-01 15:05:25 Carried my durag and coconut oil. 
4140 2018-08-01 15:05:24 Mofos always tryna get me and spend more tryna give me synthetic oil and shit I just want 5w 30 Favcts
4141 2018-08-01 15:05:23 . @pgarrett my boss, Nina Selzer, is a HUGE fan of yours, her birthday is this friday and it would mean THE WORLD if you sent her a note or voice message. She's a hugely dedicated fan who has traveled the world to see Midnight Oil, as well as a member of the fan club.
4142 2018-08-01 15:05:17 I need to get an oil change and inspection sticker ASAP 
4143 2018-08-01 15:05:15  I hope you're not the one cos she just finished frying potatoes, the oil is still hot
4144 2018-08-01 15:05:14 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4145 2018-08-01 15:05:04 Sauteed button mushrooms in olive oil topped w/ garlic bits 
4146 2018-08-01 15:05:02 Minas tergolong jenis light oil, kualitasnya bagus, demikian juga harganya.

Duri tergolong heavy oil, ngambilnya harus pakai steam injection untuk nurunin viskositasnya agar bisa ngalir ke sumur. Harganya relatif lebih rendah dibanding Minas crude.
4147 2018-08-01 15:05:01 My mom always said to use the boiling oil. Heat up oil and pour it in their ear while their sleeping. They’ll never touch you again.
4148 2018-08-01 15:04:56 Siram aja mint oil nya ke matanya MI . Eh jangan ding, sayang oilnya ya.
4149 2018-08-01 15:04:53 Ive tried ALLLLLL the oils and atm got a constant flow of boiling water with olbas oil but nothing is working:( will attempt the head pressing, thank you!

4151 2018-08-01 15:04:42 Is "clean hair care" an impossibility? Why can't I find something to tame my frizzies, help straighten my waves and protect from heat without it being a heavy oil? #cleanbeauty #HairCare #safesynthetics
4152 2018-08-01 15:04:40 Castor oil it's perfect for eyebrows

4155 2018-08-01 15:03:55 Arnhem: benieuwd wat hier werd gebrouwen. Vaak is het hennepolie / hasholie (Butane Honey Oil, BHO) waar het mee fout gaat, maar daar zou ik dan tig knallen verwachten van ontploffende gasbusjes,,,,,,

4158 2018-08-01 15:03:36 Olbas oil is a lifesaver, but try this: “Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. After you’ve done that, tap two fingers on your forehead between your eyebrows and your nose. Repeat the whole sequences (press, tap, release) again and again for about 20 seconds.”

4162 2018-08-01 15:03:08 My mom used to trick my sister and me into cleaning the van when we needed an oil change by telling us they took toys from children that are left in the vehicle...and tbh I think that’s the most genius idea
4163 2018-08-01 15:03:05 NATGAS & OIL 1H move up & test 20MA or "dip" higher to correct, will now continue lower. WATCH
GOLD fails to hold new 1218 support, holds corellation with USD 1H that moves slightly above 200MA, again. If it continues higher then GOLD DUST ?
4164 2018-08-01 15:02:51 They don't add up like the oil and whisky revenues, but I'm sure we'll get by.
4165 2018-08-01 15:02:30 Happy Birthday Colorado! The oil and natural gas industry is proud to support the state of Colorado’s economy and way of life. The industry supports over 232,000 jobs in the state of CO & contributes nearly $31.4 billion to the economy!

4170 2018-08-01 15:01:47 Guys when @MorningFreshNG says superior grease cutting power better believe them. I just experienced it now and I'm shook. You know what I mean if you've ever put Palm oil in plastic plate and tried to get it all off!
4171 2018-08-01 15:01:47 Get u a guy that will change the oil in your car so you dont have to be an adult and actually take care of it
4172 2018-08-01 15:01:35 Getting an oil change as a women is SO ANNOYING.
4173 2018-08-01 15:01:34 I meant oil and water, Freudian slip

1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% scots get from WM?
2) Do you think half of scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

4179 2018-08-01 15:00:40 Excellent chart. A key reason why I'm waiting until the stock market crashes in the US to exchange all of my US dollars to Canadian dollars before the Fed reverses course to QE and the dollar dumps while oil soars to triple digits in 2019.

4192 2018-08-01 14:59:05 I never do and I always feel like the tin man without his oil can and I hurt myself at the gym like once a month.

4194 2018-08-01 14:59:03 If anyone wants whiter / healthier teeth & gums - OIL PULL ... it works & feels amazing ... I fucking love coconut oil
4195 2018-08-01 14:58:58 In addition to being book launch day it is also the day the oil light came on in my 1998 car. So, stopped to add oil. Then top of the car's oil cap broke to pieces in my hand as I tried to open it, leaving base stuck in the opening.

Also it was raining. 

Work hard, stay humble?
4196 2018-08-01 14:58:43 oil is just. no.
4197 2018-08-01 14:58:37 His voice is so soothing. I feel like I should have a blunt and a cup of that oil by a fireplace lol
4198 2018-08-01 14:58:35 The oils leave my skin feeling so soft and smooth for daaaaaaaaaays. And yes, there benefits with each oil in the mixture. My skin doesn't react the same way with lotions so oils are my go to.
4199 2018-08-01 14:58:31 ana oil hahaha
4200 2018-08-01 14:58:30 throwback when aloma gave us oil to remove our makeup and i gagged so much i almost puked. thank you althea for saving my life.
4201 2018-08-01 14:58:04 Well Norway is very wealthy thanks to the North Sea oil money.  Also, the population is 5.2 million for all of Norway...so you’re comparing apples to watermelons.
4202 2018-08-01 14:57:54 dont you think  genel is much better bet...like its has loads of oil and pumping more....gets paid c.30million dollars every month and pretty much no debt?

Once again Happy Celebrations my BOT 
4206 2018-08-01 14:57:11 It doesn't necessarily mean it's less (or more healthy). Depends on the oil, coconut/avocado/olive are the best (seed oils are bad). I add cinnamon too, and to sweet potato it's so good. Shoutout to Edmonton market with the cheap plantain and sweet potato
4207 2018-08-01 14:57:10 From the piece, I’d infer it is Camelina oil…..which is GM, but it was hard to tell
4208 2018-08-01 14:56:54 govnor insley concerned about CDN tankers but not the US’s.Fonda concerned about alberta but not calif tarsands.Gore concerned about CDN oil asUSA leads in oil/gas exports.USA sends 600 million to stop Canadas oil/gas.They are protecting what’s important to the US...the markets!
4209 2018-08-01 14:56:45 Universal health care would fall under the same thing ur bitching about. It’s a farce a sham snake oil.

4214 2018-08-01 14:56:24 I wouldn't watch you if you were the last thing on television. YOU sold out Alaska and sold out pristine Alaskan land to Canadian Oil companies. You voted against health care. You are a disgrace and should NOT hold office.

4219 2018-08-01 14:55:42 Red Adair was a real oil rig firefighter. That was a method he used.
4220 2018-08-01 14:55:41 I get where Brett is coming from, many Oil fans are frustrated. I just think that if he believes all that he says, then walking away is not having mom and dad store his Oiler gear. Leads me to believe he will be back once the Oilers turn it around and the attention lessens.
4221 2018-08-01 14:55:40 What if I return to .......will I have to start from scratch or I should just stick to oil and gas
4222 2018-08-01 14:55:30 “pan tumaca”, “pa amb tomàquet”, “pa amb oli” - basically Spanish tomatoes on toast. Smash em up (grate or blend iyw). Bit of garlic in there (optional). Serve on lightly toasted baguette. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle rock salt. Basic, but delicious.

4225 2018-08-01 14:55:05 Our Toyota went 210,000 miles and only ever needed oil changes.
4226 2018-08-01 14:54:54 When people are incorrectly implying something based on anecdotal evidence on Twitter, I’ll correct it whenever I want to. Everywhere in NA, oil and gas jobs are down about 25% from peak. Prices and company profiles are the main drivers. Not the government of the day.
4227 2018-08-01 14:54:49 How does calling for independence from US resources get translated, in your mind, into idolizing South American socialists and becoming dependent on Venezuelan oil? Do you really lack that much imagination?
4228 2018-08-01 14:54:42 That's true. I can thank @SenTomCotton especially but of course other republicans for making it impossible for the people of Arkansas or anywhere to fight big oil! And then there's the water thing..

4236 2018-08-01 14:53:05 Ok, as far as the Carbon Tax is concerned, I always thought it was an environmental policy. Isn't it a good thing? Are companies leaving because Prince Marmalade of the States has essentially adopted an isolationist policy? Also, haven't the Libs started work on a pipeline 4 oil?

4238 2018-08-01 14:52:55 My favorite one is the Formula 10.0.6 Picture Perfect Day daily moisturizer (you can get it at Ulta, I believe it’s $5-7) it smells super nice and has spf too!! But also, I suggest getting a facial oil with vitamin E in it. Just three drops in the morning and night patted in!!

4243 2018-08-01 14:51:50 Hawt- I mean r-right the two of you should wrestle while having this argument and i'll just be an innocent bystander~

4244 2018-08-01 14:51:49 If you love someone, give them a good head massage with coconut oil under the lazy summer sun, even if they are bald. It improves scalp health and helps remove dandruff. Do it before the August sunny afternoons are gone and you're left with a boring autumn.
4245 2018-08-01 14:51:26 On my maternal side, my granddad is from an Iraqi Shia family and my grandma was from a Syrian Sunni family that lived in Iraq. Sectarianism is a foreign import to Iraq, a 'divide-and-conquer' tool favoured by tyrants (Saddam Hussein) and invaders (the US/UK/NATO/oil leeches).

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。

4248 2018-08-01 14:51:12 ... when your dad is helping cook and says, "Do we use the virgin olive oil or SKANK oil?" 
4249 2018-08-01 14:51:04 Fair enough, I'll oil one of them up real quick.

4252 2018-08-01 14:50:31 So much oil is it for dry skin or does it have other benefits?
4253 2018-08-01 14:49:22 Oil prices gone down due to more being found and added to the circulation, atleast I'll never wake up and see; Bitcoin prices fall as 10 million coins added to the circulation.
4254 2018-08-01 14:49:20 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
4255 2018-08-01 14:49:19 That's not art....it's something I would liken to those cheap oil paintings you can buy at one of those " Starving Artists" sales held at your local Holiday Inn ballroom....
4256 2018-08-01 14:49:17 Wait, am I a mom too? They all tag me in that shit. Like, No I don’t want to change my life with peppermint oil, I don’t need 636 children’s books a month and no, I do not need to get rid of fat with saran wrap, but thanks.
4257 2018-08-01 14:49:16 Yes it should be back on the table. A country that can be self sufficient when it comes to oil and is not, is not taking national security seriously! Is letting many jobs and oil revenues leave this country. #Irresponsible #lackofleadership #votepandering

4264 2018-08-01 14:48:39 I wasn't trying to make a strawman. It was purely observational from an outsider perspective. We have had multiple articles about whites having no culture. We have had people attacked for "cutural appropriation". The burrito truck in Seattle is a good example.

4266 2018-08-01 14:48:30 Rmp on the move now!Alaska North Slope is a monster potential 400 MMbbls. Pre-drill i expect SP to be at 14p, currently just over 2p. The drill target is immediately adjacent to Horseshoe-1/1A oil well drilled by the Repsol-led joint venture in 2017 & they found 1.2 MMbbls  #RMP
4267 2018-08-01 14:48:18 Do people realize we would’ve had a large draw in both oil & gasoline had exports stayed flat WoW even w/ a pick up in refinery utilization.. the export #s are too volatile on a week-week basis to make these weekly inventory #s matter as much as they do for the oil figure. #OOTT
4268 2018-08-01 14:48:17 When WM takes 92% of our oil and gas revenues Mark explain how we spend more than we earn?,,bearing in mind we are 92% DOWN on oil and gas alone?
Are also suggesting England wont trade with indy Scotland?
4269 2018-08-01 14:47:42 @BudgetFrance all because the oil levels were not checked prior to the rental, very, very frustrating

4271 2018-08-01 14:47:28 I feel you man. I got up at 7:30am rolled right out of bed to loading my car full of tires and driving to the mechanic to get an oil change and tire change up.

The rate APC is going down, they may eventually discover oil.
4286 2018-08-01 14:46:08 But right after, I will bear around again, lol. Let's ride the roller coaster. Because we know how this ends up in the long term. By the end of the year (or the beginning of 2019), oil should end up like Tuco. Season 2 is good so far :)
4287 2018-08-01 14:46:05 No-Norway is his model. And Venezuela merely was bad currently oil spike and historic lack of democracy , not a good example of anything except bad management.

4293 2018-08-01 14:45:10 There may be several definitions. However, even the oldest form 'Moslem Brotherhood' didn't start before the 1920s after the 1st wave (18xx). Islam was comparatively weak before modern islamism spread. Another reason: Saudis became rich since 1973 (oil crisis) and payed islamist

4300 2018-08-01 14:44:40 So when u were radical eco terrorists racheal u chased the oil companies away with taxes, regulations, carbon restrictions. Now u realize the oil còmpanies are the ones that paid for ur teachers and govt worker and ur using govt money to get them back. The horses are gone.
4301 2018-08-01 14:44:35 Yeah, turning Puerto Rico over to the same people who idolize Chavez, Maduro, and Ortega is the solution! Btw do you know how many small Caribbean islands are dependent on cheap Venezuelan oil?

4312 2018-08-01 14:43:36 6X6 challenge! The trade challenge is to average 6 ticks move on 6 contracts trading Crude oil 1 hour a day. 1 tick in CL = $10 x 6 = $60 x 6 = $360 - commissions ($30) =$330 a day average. Trading 240 days a year =$79200 a year. to double results double contract size.

4317 2018-08-01 14:43:14 These local politicians are often not the brightest candles in the chandelier. Most were probably easy marks for the big-city grifter Kobach. Just look how many Americans fell for the neocons' arrogant assurances that the Iraq war would pay for itself with oil revenues.

4323 2018-08-01 14:42:43 Dear Sachin, lovely to see this from my childhood hero. Just one question for you: would you also be interested in encouraging India to adopt more sustainably sourced palm oil? At the moment, much of the palm oil India consumes causes deforestation. Can you help? @edwardleodavey
4324 2018-08-01 14:42:37 In LA, instead of thermometers, people just check to see how liquid the coconut oil in their cabinet is, and I think that’s beautiful
4325 2018-08-01 14:42:35 You've been as wrong as wrong can be on price of oil dating back to your @CNBCFastMoney appearances a couple yrs ago. U and "whale oil" Gartman need to find a different commodity to comment on.
4326 2018-08-01 14:42:29 @BudgetFrance hired a car in Nice on 26thJuly, oil light came on yeast night. Called the breakdown this morning , they advised not to drive.
4327 2018-08-01 14:42:14 to be fair though, no one takes time to change the oil in a car that never runs! So it cuts both ways

4343 2018-08-01 14:40:50 Yes! And even really basic stuff like the impact of oil prices dipping in the early to mid 80s. It's frustrating to see a once-every-five-years story blown so badly.

4347 2018-08-01 14:40:42 Some of the s/holders here have obviously never checked on the financial or productivity history. Few barrels here, few barrels there. It is a typical AIM pump and dump, salary producing stock. It only produces meagre amounts of oil but massive amounts of debt!
4348 2018-08-01 14:40:23 Just like petrol price at the pump, once they have tasted the bigger margin and can get away with higher price, it doesn't come down easily... even with the drop in International oil price

But how can we save on forex by promoting domestic tourism. On the contrary we can increase our forex by promoting foreign tourism.

4462 2018-08-01 14:29:03 If you have combination skin, this makes choosing the right soap that much easier. Shea may add moisture, but coconut oil may help prevent overactive oil glands.
4463 2018-08-01 14:28:57 So, here's the thing, there is no such thing as a panacea.
A panacea is a cure-all drug or supplement that solves all your woes.

4493 2018-08-01 14:26:09 The last time I got an oil change the man told me I needed new brakes, a new battery , and all of this other ish...I opted for a cheaper place for my oil change and tire rotation which was $30 cheaper and they mentioned none of that
4494 2018-08-01 14:26:06 Yun I know you're only here for an oil change but listen your air filter is 4000 miles away from needing replacing, so that'll just be an extra $435 nbd I got my boys on it rn
4495 2018-08-01 14:26:05 wooow, oil painting lang pala yan galeeeng!
4496 2018-08-01 14:26:01 When oil is gone.
4497 2018-08-01 14:25:48 @realDonaldTrump things I’ve bought without an I.D., Groceries, TV, furniture, clothes, more groceries, records, turntables, bikes, Nike KDVI’s, a lot of Kobe’s, CBD oil, kombucha, more groceries, iphones, more sneakers...
What’s scary tho is the idiots cheering your stupidity.
4498 2018-08-01 14:25:39 If the government offered as much support to small businesses as it does to conglomerates, American may not be as screwed. What they need to do is stop subsidizing farms, oil etc.
4499 2018-08-01 14:25:34 We will not be at Macro Oil today. 

Hope to see you all next week!

4501 2018-08-01 14:25:30 This all started years ago when Chevez would not allow his oil to get into US control and the CIA simply did a 'regime change' which they so often do. And like Iraq and Libya, Venezuela is now also in a shambles.

4503 2018-08-01 14:25:08 Coal India, Lupin , Indian Oil Corporation, Bharti Infratel, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and BPCL emerged as the top gainers in the Nifty index on Wednesday.
4504 2018-08-01 14:25:05 Can’t believe I only realised my coconut oil melted due to the weather last night ffs
4505 2018-08-01 14:25:03 Oh yeah. That's the impression I get as well. He doesn't actually seem bothered by it as he breathlessly tweets about it. It comes off as an act.
4506 2018-08-01 14:25:01 who are you to talk?¿?? you’re literally me, with an extra layer of cooking oil in your hair
4507 2018-08-01 14:24:51 Context please. Is the fish dead? Alive? Food? Sick? Lost? Confused? Does it need to be anointed with olive oil and butter?

4512 2018-08-01 14:24:07 I’d like to thank des for introducing marula oil into my life
4513 2018-08-01 14:24:06 Then they switch to margerine until they see how palm oil is killing tigers and Monsanto are the illuminati

4516 2018-08-01 14:23:58 PDP will never rule Nigeria forever again, they never rule akwah ibom again. For 16 years PDP destroyed Nigeria. Looted $500 billion oil funds, the injuries PDP injured Nigerians and Nigeria are still fresh wounds.

4519 2018-08-01 14:23:44 I just don't get it. trump is so obviously a snake oil salesman.
4520 2018-08-01 14:23:43 oil numbers shortly
4521 2018-08-01 14:23:43 Even with FU money from oil socialism doesn’t work.
4522 2018-08-01 14:23:43 We're being duped by snake oil salesmen, keen to prop up the gargantuan ego and ambitions of one individual in the hope of a few crumbs from the #Olympic Table. Keep fighting the culture of secrecy and waste at #yyccc Jeromy, the majority of #yyc is right behind you.
4523 2018-08-01 14:23:39 Tieni anche conto che all'epoca della standard oil i debiti pubblici erano molto più esigui. Vediamo se si trova qualcosa
4524 2018-08-01 14:23:31 I voted for BLT but tomato salad is on my plate almost everyday in season. Tomatoes must be peeled. Cut in wedges. Thinly sliced red onion, lots of chopped basil, salt, pepper, drizzle of olive oil. Crusty bread to dip makes this perfection.
4525 2018-08-01 14:23:26 I had one appointment today..and they canceled. Guess I'll go get my oil changed
4526 2018-08-01 14:23:20 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
4527 2018-08-01 14:23:18 sadly the only thing we can debate is taxes, the oil price and the rand we are helpless. The economy is deteriorating by day
4528 2018-08-01 14:23:18 Ideal climate: that at which coconut oil is in between solid and liquid

4531 2018-08-01 14:23:12 You know what...getting my oil changed at the actual dealership where I got my car is such a rip off...
4532 2018-08-01 14:23:11 When someone explains to me where our deep desire for religion (in me, my family & approx 90% of the world) comes from, I might agree.. until then, open to suggestions.  

You could boil me in oil, I'd still be crying out to god(s)... some of us unaccountably wired that way?
4533 2018-08-01 14:23:07 Urgh 1st fast & furious where he’s pumping oil into that guys mouth is awful! 
4534 2018-08-01 14:23:03 Our African leaders must do away with that stupid tendency of not accepting defeat. Is the poor masses that always suffer at the end~~blood shed. The Electoral bodies must stop cooking results using Olive oil, please pronounce what's decided by the electorates 

#ZimElections2018
4535 2018-08-01 14:22:57 That is because OIL & GAS is what keeps the Canadian economy afloat!
4536 2018-08-01 14:22:49 The NDP chose to appease Trudeau instead of telling him where he could go.   What a disaster, feds refuse to deal with the real issues, scare away private investors, buy a pipeline so that they can idle it ad nausium.  AB oilpatch should be soaring as the oil industry is globally
4537 2018-08-01 14:22:47 Oh no. No tampons. Just freeze the coconut oil + tea tree mixture and it’s insertable on its own plus it’s nice and cooling! lmao
4538 2018-08-01 14:22:32 @KeithRowleyPNM  dear friend, do not forget that we are a world power in minerals, and that when the mature government of Nicolás falls overthrown, we will sadly have to remember your words. enough oil that Venezuela has given them. You are badly grateful. #31Jul #Venezuela

4540 2018-08-01 14:22:15 Omg  the last one killed me! “You cooked your hair”  just so you know I keep my hot tools on 300 ! And stopped using coconut oil! 
4541 2018-08-01 14:22:08 BVN pepper dem, TSA injure dem, Sales of stolen Assets shocked dem, Revocation of Oil licenses got dem dead.

 Economic Parasites!
4542 2018-08-01 14:22:00 At the car shop getting oil change and literally everything Is wrong  with my car lmfaooo wtf
4543 2018-08-01 14:21:58 Ohohohoh challenge accepted.

4545 2018-08-01 14:21:53 How about a fetish for cleaning five oil spills under cars, that's your mom's fave!
4546 2018-08-01 14:21:43 As the old saying goes: "It is the ECONOMY stupid!"  What do you think keeps the Canadian economy afloat?  It is OIL & GAS!
4547 2018-08-01 14:21:33 That’s a beaut
4548 2018-08-01 14:21:30 What's the fun in that? Takes longer to switch turf trays and arms over to automotive then to do the whole oil change.
4549 2018-08-01 14:21:17 You’re supposed to brush you hair (100 strokes) so the oil moves down the shaft of your hair & try not to touch your scalp bc the oils from your fingers make your hair greasy

4557 2018-08-01 14:20:02 Fried potatoes alone, ate boiled potatoes with cinnamon, salt, and olive oil, drank lavender and mint tea. Inês is over. Kinda peaceful here,, for now
4558 2018-08-01 14:19:59 Historically Scotland has raised more per head, so Barnet created, but now in deficit and oil in decline. Bad time. If we joined EU per SNP there would be no Barnet formula, Scotland would have to raise all the taxes it spends and our deficit couldnt exceed 3%of gdp. Risky.
4559 2018-08-01 14:19:47 Tujuan utama : beli argan oil buat serum rambut.

4560 2018-08-01 14:19:33 CBD is awesome i had a recurring sebaceous cyst. Put CBD oil on it daily for a week it has not come back that eas 2 months ago!
4561 2018-08-01 14:19:29 Sometimes mixes are magic. I worked for a famcy chef who swore by duncan hines yellow cake mix with famcy butter subbed in for the oil, and the result was just unbelievable
4562 2018-08-01 14:19:22 Sifu !
4563 2018-08-01 14:19:18 Let me draw you a picture.

You have a gallon bucket. It contains 2 cups of oil, atop 2 cups of water; 50% oil, 50% H2O.

There's a hole in the bottom of the bucket.

4568 2018-08-01 14:18:40 Yeah that was why i didn’t bother to touch oil either but honestly i say give it a try cus you never know. Or at least play with it and see how comfortable you’re with it. I love it now but I’m not gonna go full oil get until i can figure it out

4572 2018-08-01 14:18:15 huhu iya bgt kak.. apalagi kalo dehidrasi > oil-water balancenya ga seimbang > malah nge trigger more oil production > more breakouts  jadi dalemnya mah sebenernya dehydrated tp luarnya minyakan 
4573 2018-08-01 14:18:13 Last night I did a quick swish with a cup of water with two drops of oregano oil (shut up) and the last 12 hours have been an oregano scented fantasy. Oregano is apparently the most powerful essential oil in the universe. All hail our new oil overlords
4574 2018-08-01 14:18:06 True. We will never know if Standard Oil would have reached $1 Trillion due to the anti trust break up.
4575 2018-08-01 14:18:05 ada cara cuci muka ala suji gt 4 menit bersihin pake cleansing oil, 2 menit pake sabun smbl dipijet trs 4 menit lagi di bilas ada threadnya tp aku males nyari hahaha
4576 2018-08-01 14:18:03 That is why Baba asked you to go back to farm in other to survive the oil failure.

4578 2018-08-01 14:17:50 It's interesting how when fuel and oil prices had dropped in the past significantly, that the news articles didn't say " Due to declining oil and fuel prices, airlines reduce fares, drop baggage fees". Such a BS thing to warn of increases but never decrease in good times???
4579 2018-08-01 14:17:49 Drilling for oil is boring.

4586 2018-08-01 14:16:15 ピカチュウZってあのでんきだま10万でいいっていうあの……！？
4587 2018-08-01 14:16:11 No reason for it. Oil prices have been down for a month now. Gas, not so much. We are being ripped off again. Soft strike. Everytime you get gas, if the price hasn't dropped, buy only enough to last a couple days. If enough people do it, they get the message.
4588 2018-08-01 14:16:11 Sagot ko oil hahaha. Miss na kita
4589 2018-08-01 14:16:09 WTI oil trading chatroom update #OOTT :  Lots of CFD and Forex traders passing through now wanting time of EIA stat announcement. Some discussion of recent correlation of NQ to WTI price movements.
No insults traded yet, everyone making nice.
4590 2018-08-01 14:16:06 I’m finna buy a lot. I’m finna mix it w some oils for my scalp. This oil I got irritates it. So I gotta switch it up. And I’m getting excema and shit on my arm. I gotta get some natural products
4591 2018-08-01 14:15:57 I like the way you put that. Tip of the cap to you, Will.
4592 2018-08-01 14:15:55 I spilled hot cooking oil on my foot while drunk cooking and kinda hope it scars bc it's a cool pattern
4593 2018-08-01 14:15:51 USA now almost self sufficient in oil because of fracking
....we could do the same.
4594 2018-08-01 14:15:48 And now the favourite tool of the anti TMX crowd, the false dichotomy. As much as you want it to be, TMX is not a choice between building a pipeline or producing less oil. It's a choice between more or less safe transportation methods. Consumption is unrelated to TMX.
4595 2018-08-01 14:15:42 He did well even shekarau did well, but i am telling you it is not different in kano the old schools dont have seats. I am a teacher in kano state.
4596 2018-08-01 14:15:41 T&Ps for any of you that have to regularly travel 96th/Keystone. After this oil change, Joellas!
4597 2018-08-01 14:15:41 I bet y'all didn't know castor oil is good for your hair(afro).
4598 2018-08-01 14:15:35 Macros are different per person. When you go on the Keto app you have to put in your weight and your goals, and the app will calculate everything for you: if you feel hungry all thee time make sure you are eating enough good fats like avocado, mct oil, coconut oil, & ghee
4599 2018-08-01 14:15:27 The coordinated efforts to bewilder the public (on Climate Change) did not begin in earnest until 1989.

During the '80's, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon & Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions
4600 2018-08-01 14:15:26 'Chasing' a wealthy high school girl when he was a late 20s something attorney trolling $$ for his oil aspirations is another feather in his hat
4601 2018-08-01 14:15:20 Ballard makes oil as a Markov chains includes records A work between geology are able to say they do not meet User Interface
4602 2018-08-01 14:15:18 Someone needs to explain that those 25k jobs aren't coming back. Those jobs were the fat our bloated oil industry shed to maintain profitability.
4603 2018-08-01 14:15:13 Smh lemme send you some olive oil
4604 2018-08-01 14:15:12 Luckily it hasn't come up during an MOT, randomly comes and goes! Sometimes if I put oil in it, it'll go 
4605 2018-08-01 14:15:07 Higher wages to pay for higher electricity, gas, oil and food! Thanks douches for nothing! I’m sure the rich are happy along with their great tax breaks for ignorant trump because basically it’s only the righ who benefits! Douches!
4606 2018-08-01 14:15:02 And the oil lamps that lasted 8? night's. Is that correct? I was raised Roman Catholic but I hope I learned some things living in NYC.

4610 2018-08-01 14:14:48 How naive guys like @tufailelif can get ? It is "YEDA BAN KAR PEDA KHANA". Muslims do netagiri about global islam situation, instead of focusing on their bread and butter. Ham paanch hamare pachchees - so we can rule over world, u r ruling in Saudi, will it survive w/o oil market
4611 2018-08-01 14:14:44 Ano ba height mo papi? Try mo homemade shake na tinitake ko ngayon so far nag gain naman ako monthly ng 1kg ngayon d na ko underweight.  4 banana + 1cup oatmeal + 6 eggs (egg white) + 2 cups milk + 8tbsp olive oil = weight gainer
4612 2018-08-01 14:14:32 Toner&face oil
4613 2018-08-01 14:14:30 Some of the Daiya is hit or miss with me. It retains a heavy taste of oil(cus let's be honest, that's what it is). I haven't heard of FYH so I'll look into that!
4614 2018-08-01 14:14:12 We know it is the N Texas oil $ & the abortion wedge issue that takes the elections hostage since Ann Richards was Gov.
4615 2018-08-01 14:14:06 that will never happen, once the uk is out , westminster will require every ounce of exportable revenue to stop rioting, whiskey and oil exports will fund this  IMHO
4616 2018-08-01 14:14:00 Maybe so, but MUCH less irresponsible than to continue to destroy the planet by burning oil.
4617 2018-08-01 14:13:51 Just a simple Salad. Chop up half an avocado, add a little salt, oil, and vinegar. Nomnomnom...
4618 2018-08-01 14:13:44 Nakita ko nga kanina sa dorm. so sweet. hope oil

4621 2018-08-01 14:13:34 Absolutely Yes. Canada needs to stop importing oil. Lets take care of our own energy needs by buying Canadian products only.  Not to mention the benefits of creating jobs and rejuvenating the economic engine of this country.

4624 2018-08-01 14:13:24 Just like most simple minded liberals they chase out their biggest job creator, oil , ( 7major ones just left oilsands) tax every body into poverty, tell them to buy crap that doesn’t work well like hybrids or electric. I just had a crap smarter than you.
4625 2018-08-01 14:13:19 It could save our environment with less CO2 emissions?  But what he wants is to sell as much oil and gas as possible...screw the environment.
4626 2018-08-01 14:13:16 OILのしみたシャツで　涙拭うおまえ　覚えてる
4627 2018-08-01 14:13:03 Not hard! Fry the outside (I used oil and butter to prevent the butter from burning) then finish in the oven with a little liquid (water or broth).
4628 2018-08-01 14:12:41 AGREED  
now ask why

Trump only cares about Trump. 

His voters bought the snake oil. 
The rest of us are collateral damage in this narcissistic poisoning of our democracy. 

America does not have a dictator. Truth and decency will prevail.

4632 2018-08-01 14:12:21 What's amazing is the unnecessary battles. Scientists could have developed better tools and technologies governments could have supported and oil companies could have developed better products that benefited both economic needs and environment. Instead they all abused free will.
4633 2018-08-01 14:12:12 @USAmbCanada Given the difference in prices for Western Canadian Select Oil and West Texas Intermediate, are mainly due to pipelines not being built in Canada, and there are Americans behind such chicanery - what is the position of the US federal gov't on this? Thanks..1

4637 2018-08-01 14:11:34 There is no rule of law here anymore. Look at the mismanagement of this nation, the power of lobbyists, special interests, big pharma/energy/oil & the military industrial complex that rule & control everything, including ALL media. Everything is biased. Probe will end in failure.

4668 2018-08-01 14:06:40 There's scientific evidence that point to pollution from oil exploration activities by big oil companies in the ND. E.g. oil spills, gas flaring etc.

But pipeline vandalism, illegal oil bunkering etc. are also causes of oil pollution. There's no denying those facts.

4765 2018-08-01 13:54:29 My point exactly!!!! Dubai didn’t have oil too like us and boom we now go to Dubai for holidays but looted our entire crude oil earnings
4766 2018-08-01 13:54:17 Without new technology the stripmining required for rare minerals for solar panels, electric cars and other such "Environmentally friendly" advances basically outweighs coal/oil shit.

4772 2018-08-01 13:53:50 I've never implied they're successful. Everyone one of the political elite are corrupt in some form and do not speak for the people. All parties appease bankers, pharmaceutical and oil companies. But to be as opposed to EVERYTHING as this twat is, smacks of playing politics.
4773 2018-08-01 13:53:50 Y'all use Almond Oil.

Method: warm it up,start by put it on the scalp,cover all the hair (not too much) and massage it in bese you leave it for 30 Minutes before rinsing it off and wash it off with a shampoo.

I hope it helps.

4817 2018-08-01 13:48:42 Research? Modern snake oil 
journos like @hzeffman have worked out there's no need for real journalism if you're pumping out smears for powerful interests.  Real journalism is only needed if you're 'speaking truth to power'.

4827 2018-08-01 13:47:31 I mention the oil, cartels &  prices as possible motivations for your refusal to acknowledge climate change. I struggle to comprehend your ability to put it aside as a consideration, when its effects are plain to see, and the science simple to grasp.

4906 2018-08-01 13:40:07 My point, if you could read a chart, is that in the oil and gas industry in the US there used be 200k employees where there are now 150k employees.

4911 2018-08-01 13:39:30 eu particularmente não curti muito quando descoloria o cabelo. preferia fazer a parte de nutrição com óleos. as minhas máscaras preferidas da Lola são a Argan Oil, Dream Cream e essas novas manteigas. se quiser tirar qq dúvida, pode mandar msg :)
4912 2018-08-01 13:39:25 Missed the gym again today, but at least I’m going to get my oil changed and tires rotated. #adulting
4913 2018-08-01 13:39:22 Medical marijuana could help greatly. Fingers crossed. I find coconut oil helps stability and gut to a degree. It's a combination of calming the ANS physiologically and mentally along with supporting healthy gut microbiota. No easy task!

4915 2018-08-01 13:39:13 In agribusiness, one particularly controversial plant is palm oil. Forests have been felled to make room for palm oil plantations, and the edible oil is in about half of all packaged supermarket products, from chocolate, margarine, and ice cream to shampoo and lipstick.-NG

4920 2018-08-01 13:38:52 You are being sarcastic, right? What about finite resources (oil, rare earth metals) that feed into this ever-growing model?
4921 2018-08-01 13:38:49 Ours too. And we'd climb onto the roof of our house, literally by climbing the tree outside my bedroom window, to be "closer to the sun"!  Iodine and baby oil tucked in our swim suits. Mom was just happy we were "outside 'till dinner time".

4942 2018-08-01 13:36:44 You can bet once the auto shop told me that an oil change would take 2 hours that I took my junk of a car home and did an oil change in 25 minutes. 
4943 2018-08-01 13:36:44 Yeah, a greater risk of saving money that his buddies in oil need so the can show another record profit for the next quarter.

How can anyone be stupid enough to believe this shit?
4944 2018-08-01 13:36:39 Mmm. Alberta cleared to further increase GHG emissions to allow for expansion of oil sands exported without refining in Canada & Irving adding value to crude that hasn't generated CDN GHGs, placed at a disadvantage because Gallant gave away shop to curry favour w Trudeau Libs.

4951 2018-08-01 13:35:46 This drop in Oil like won't last more than a week. The next move up could see 70, 76.50 then 80 but it won't be straightup. If we fall below 66 it's going to get volatile. The long term is nothing like the short term chart.

5006 2018-08-01 13:29:08 The coast to coast transports to feed the power stations in the west are daily, and it’s ridiculous. They need more plumbing, methinks. Saudi alone transports a lot, but you’ll even find Venezuelan oil going through here to India at these prices.
5007 2018-08-01 13:28:43 So the big crash in oil prices which happened BEFORE the NDP were elected forced the industry to become more efficient and use technology to trim some jobs. I thought Cons were all in with efficiency. #Hypocrite

5047 2018-08-01 13:24:58 He's a snake oil salesman a hocker like the old circus circuit that used to have a hocker selling the elixir that was a cure all for all that ailed you, he is a fake a liar and a traitor.

5050 2018-08-01 13:24:34 Love @EatWellForLess but really disappointed to see palm oil specified & not a word as to how horrific it is for the planet. Do Better Eat Well #notopalmoil #proearth
5051 2018-08-01 13:24:22 Acosta has been doing these kind of remotes, usually post rally, with Trump crowds since 2016.  I was at one when he literally waited for the anti-CNN crowd to grow behind him, went live then said.....see, they're picking on me again.  Acosta is the Godfather of #FakeNews .
5052 2018-08-01 13:24:11 On a cycle home last year, a fly managed get right up into my ear canal. Right up to the eardrum. I had to drown it in olive oil.

Came out in the shower about 2 weeks later. So grim.
5053 2018-08-01 13:24:11 I heard this kind of crap about the middle class for YEARS while working for an ultra wealthy progressive 'democrat'.  They are elite and we are all 'Deliverance'.  The party is SUCH an astonishing lie.  Conservatives value the middle class.  Dems do not.

5057 2018-08-01 13:23:22 I see a lot of photos taken at Westcreek. I’m glad y’all had lane machines sent ahead otherwise you wouldn’t have had any oil
5058 2018-08-01 13:23:21 Lol....and plenty unnecessary oil.
5059 2018-08-01 13:23:09 You don't order it by the bag, you order it by the drum. An oil drum. Usually 25 or 50 kilo
5060 2018-08-01 13:22:54 Have you never met neoconservative republicans before?

These are the same class of assholes that used political leverage from 9/11 to jack up the surveillance state and start a fake war for oil with no plan that spawned one of the most malicious organizations on the planet.

5070 2018-08-01 13:21:48 A lot might depend on where the Marathon is: if local, I’d go in the next day, if a fair journey I’d take the day off. And 48 hours post-massage should be ok. Post-Marathon hot bath with Epsom salts and/or lavender oil rubbed into legs helps too for recovery. For me anyway!

5078 2018-08-01 13:21:26 All regions, please follow @RandPaul as called Kentucky office this morning 2 state my concerns on @POTUS selling out to #Italy to keep oil flowing.  Explained why his actions could cause a civil war on order of #Iraq.  Paul is probably one of few who might be able to reach Trump
5079 2018-08-01 13:21:23 Ok, I'll bite. Why won't she be able to hear her home? Is it because Trump shut down coal mines and put oil rich lands off limits?
5080 2018-08-01 13:21:09 No, I mean: due to scientific and technological problems, the energy cost of Chinese ships is huge, and the amount of oil burned is huge...
5081 2018-08-01 13:20:54 Yes because we had enormous forex reserves from HIGH OIL PRICES. And after oil prices fell more than 100% we couldn't just continue as we were.
5082 2018-08-01 13:20:47 I had to raise it up quite a bit to get the oil pan removed.

5102 2018-08-01 13:19:13 Yep. Canada sure craps all over their most important industry. The other thing to consider is how much the banking and insurance sectors benefit from the oil and gas sector as well: corporate debt, mortgages, car/trailer/boat/skidoo loans, bank accounts, investments, etc.

5122 2018-08-01 13:16:45 @Samir_Madani Do you have data on what oil and LNG ships, and refined product tankers have been transiting the Bab Al Mandab since the Saudi's stopped sending their ships thorugh?
5123 2018-08-01 13:16:24 First, you don't need to own anything to be negatively impacted by the rand. One small example, oil is priced in dollars. When rand tumbles oil costs more, so fuel price goes up & everything follows. Are EFF really this ignorant? 

Second, who says whites want to own everything?

5207 2018-08-01 13:08:03 Exactly. Snake oil salesmen have been ever present throughout history. Now social media brings it to everyone with a phone, cable TV or a computer, so as expected the intellectually vulnerable are falling prey in massive numbers-- like 60 million.

5212 2018-08-01 13:07:49 Right now oil companies are fucking Nigeria and the people there as well. You see who runs the oil companies....you see who is getting fucked? Nothing changes on its own.
5213 2018-08-01 13:07:48 Is the argan oil a substitute for the snake oil Musk peddles?
5214 2018-08-01 13:07:36 tbh I think tattoo-specific products are a ripoff. they’re just overpriced stuff you can get in any other product. I use coconut oil or lush’s elbow grease and a normal sunscreen and it works just fine
5215 2018-08-01 13:07:33 Really? I love fried until they have brown bits... (garlic oil is the secret). And loads of salt and pepper...

5220 2018-08-01 13:07:12 There is increasing evidence for the value of CBD oil in the treatment of many issues.  The part most people miss is that this component has NO high.  They hear Cannabis and go berserk. Hemp (Cannabis Sativa) is in many already existing products.
5221 2018-08-01 13:07:00 Will they wave cruel and unusual punishment for tourists? Public execution and dismembering are such a drag. Although we love a theocratic dictatorship as long as the oil flows!

5225 2018-08-01 13:06:35 Fresh oil. New territories. New love.
5226 2018-08-01 13:06:35 So yesterday I went to a dinner with mama's friend's family. When I came home, my sister asked, "Samreen, tum ne konsa highlighter lagaya hai? Yeh buhat acha hai."

And it was literally oil on my face, freaking oil.

5265 2018-08-01 13:02:39 I have a prescription that just went from $15 to $67 to $232.   Interest rates variable credit cards increased, some went 19% up to 36%.  Gas is higher. Oil is higher. Electric is higher. Food is higher.  Even with a tiny bump (which we didn’t get) the cost of living is soaring

5330 2018-08-01 12:56:03 I have a daughter and son. I am a dad as well as the primary cook in our house. I also do oil changes, build and fix things. I want both of my kids to learn as many of these skills as possible. I see too many helpless people between 19-35.

5333 2018-08-01 12:55:48 Sitting on the tarmac, waiting to find out if the “small oil leak” from engine #2 is going to ground us or not. Can’t decide if I’ll be more stressed out if the flight is cancelled or if we take off after someone has told me one of the engines is leaking oil.  #anxiety
5334 2018-08-01 12:55:31 Ok yeah that would be a good idea. I miss my free oil changes at the dealership. I don’t miss the hour or so sitting there waiting.
5335 2018-08-01 12:55:17 Got my mom to finally try cannabis for her PD..just the fact it helps her sleep was great. Now onto getting her some oil and edibles to actually treat the disease!! Small victories!
5336 2018-08-01 12:55:17 Had my staff badge photo today and I have bike oil on my face, look very sweaty and have a slit eyebrow 
5337 2018-08-01 12:55:12 Pollution is not only from theft, so why don't we just leave the oil in the soil and focus of harnessing other resources. Have we not received enough of pain and hurts from oil?

5345 2018-08-01 12:54:05 Sometimes harder for family & friends to understand that when you have brain cancer— there’s not really a “cure.” There’s not a “fix”. That diet, that CBD oil, that chemo, that radiation, those meditations— they might help buy time. None of them are cures. We’re petrie dishes.

5432 2018-08-01 12:41:28 I sometimes use no-poo shampoo! I know it sounds funny but it washes out excess oil without washing out the natural oil in your hair! My hair tends to get less oily over time when I use it.

5445 2018-08-01 12:39:30 I find it hard to believe that today is #EarthOvershootDay. Obv it doesn't reset every year as the concept implies.

5472 2018-08-01 12:35:55 Tillerson brought this oil coup with him into the WH ...let’s not pretend he’s something other than a conspirator
5473 2018-08-01 12:35:55 A reinvigorating facial mask, sparkling yellow, with Himalayan lemon, peacock oil, and exfoliating poppy seed. It comes in a beautiful sachet.
5474 2018-08-01 12:35:50 Not that I know of. Coconuts seem to have an interesting history in the GC, but it would be tough to track because  I don’t think they ever attracted the state’s attention like cocoa, oil palm, or rubber did. Plus women dominated the local trade / processing of coconut oil...
5475 2018-08-01 12:35:44 1943: World War II: Operation Tidal Wave also known as "Black Sunday", was a failed American attempt to destroy Romanian oil fields. #otd #tdih
5476 2018-08-01 12:35:42 Wouldn’t disagree and maybe later this year as 30p is a snip considering the update x1500% uplift on oil - more drills - tight share register - perfect #RPT
5477 2018-08-01 12:35:21 #RexTillerson turned out to be a patriot (though somewhat passive) and not the corrupt Exxon crony wanting at Russian oil as I thought would be. I’m guessing Trump was counting on him to ha e corrupt greed, as well. Thank you Mr. Tillerson for your integrity.

5489 2018-08-01 12:33:11 There will be tough experiences with periods of struggle and difficulty. While these experiences test and stretch us, they also bless us.Word of God states that during these periods God anoints us with oil, and we experience an overflow of His mercy, goodness, and unfailing Love.

5503 2018-08-01 12:30:53 Ok, fine. Name an alternative to oil that the world should be using instead of oil for energy? One caveat thought, it cannot require fossil fuel by-product to produce it or maintain it.
5504 2018-08-01 12:30:44 "I’D PUT MY MONEY ON THE SUN AND SOLAR ENERGY, WHAT A SOURCE OF POWER! I HOPE WE DON’T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL OIL AND COAL RUN OUT, BEFORE WE TACKLE THAT."

5505 2018-08-01 12:30:38 Everyone. But there is a flip-side to new cars: because they are so reliable, dealerships often rip off their customers with unnecessary repairs and oil changes (in countries where labour costs are high, you really do feel the pinch).
5506 2018-08-01 12:30:35 It’s true what Trump said (I know…I’m shocked, too).  I went to buy groceries this morning—castor oil, essence of turnip, coal, you know, the essentials—and I forgot my ID.  

I was turned away and had to walk home in the snow (uphill both ways) without my supplies. Sad!

5568 2018-08-01 12:21:58 Are you referring to Stock Tank Oil Initially in Place?

5607 2018-08-01 12:17:58 so around 160 - 300 million as Scots share costs , and we get supposedly the benefit of letting the old subs rot in Rosyth , the new ones parked on the Clyde preventing an oil boom - but importantly a Tesco fucking metro in Helensburgh for jobs.

Hard sell this union slavery.

What practical measures can the government adopt to reduce pollution arising from illegal oil refining activities in the affected areas while also positively harnessing the ingenuity of locals who hitherto have been involved in the illicit act?

5612 2018-08-01 12:17:29 How about subsidizing American oil to Germany to badly under-cut Russia's sales. It doesn't make us money--but it hurts the heck out of them.

Israel exploits US.

5878 2018-08-01 11:39:17 If we have so much energy oil in particular why are gas prices so high? And I'm tired of hearing about its refineries it's refineries BS! It's money in the pocket of the oilmen and the lobbyists that's what it is. There's no reason gas prices are $3 a gallon
5879 2018-08-01 11:39:14 When will people learn that lies are like oil in water? The truth will always surface...
5880 2018-08-01 11:39:09 探しにいったけどあまり見つからなかったンゴ……。、
5881 2018-08-01 11:39:08 Crazy how between 50%-70% of (assuming that’s an oil pen) those are cut with e-cig solution
5882 2018-08-01 11:38:45 Alex Jones is a piece of shit who pushes conspiracy theories for profit. Shame on the folks who buy what this snake oil salesman is selling.

5886 2018-08-01 11:37:58 わいつばさんは細身の人のイメージあったから175cm75kgって知った瞬間さすがにびっくりした。にゃんこらすも身長同じくらいっていうのもらにびっくりしたけど。
5887 2018-08-01 11:37:49 As oil becomes scarce, the reliance on petro-fertilizers-pesticides and transportation will prove we need to live within what the landbase is capable of giving by participation in the food chain. Soil loss and climate change must remain in our mind. Restauration is possible?
5888 2018-08-01 11:37:23 Haha, yes,  it sounded so interesting!  I have no expectations though, we'll see/taste. A perk of this hot weather is that I don't need to melt my coconut oil. It's usually always solid here. 
5889 2018-08-01 11:37:20 Have hit a research motherlode. Evidence is fountaining around me like hitting an oil well. Gusher baby, GUSHER.
5890 2018-08-01 11:37:19 You know what would make Australia self sufficient. The Iran model. You want to take Australians resources (coal gas oil etc) then you will pay the Australian people ....

5896 2018-08-01 11:35:58 The polls on 2016 proved so accurate...

You truly are a spiteful, bitter old man now that your neoconservative philosophy has been rejected & seen for the snake oil it is by most Americans.
5897 2018-08-01 11:35:58 If olive oil look for first pressed extra virgin. Doesn't matter if in glass or not as some manufacturers use plastic these days or even large cans (Italy)
5898 2018-08-01 11:35:38 Finally got a new tire . Now I just gotta get a oil change
5899 2018-08-01 11:35:36 It is a similar problem to what oil companies face and why shale production works in the USA and not other places.  If there is an existing pipeline the economics are easier, no pipeline and the production has to cover the cost of wells + facilities + pipelines

5903 2018-08-01 11:34:32 You know what they don’t show in the Jurassic Park films? How they take the old, infirm, or disabled dinos and make them into oil in an offshore lab.

5915 2018-08-01 11:31:50 Oil and water? 
Methinks for a change, we signed wisely to plug holes and strengthen weak departments, especially the goalkeeping. 
Even with the signing of the Brazilian, our CB is still shaky. How I wish we could clone Ntsimbi and Lucky!
5916 2018-08-01 11:31:41 Top work. 5.5 or so strokes a minute. If there is oil then let’s hope this is part of the test that optimises the flow. 24 hours at that rate. Thinking now that they’ve nearly completed the Portland tests and we will see tankers and an RNS.
5917 2018-08-01 11:31:19 Humidity feels like being covered in oil or something. 
5918 2018-08-01 11:30:46 @BP_plc said second-quarter profits jumped, as higher oil prices helped the energy producer push its ambitious growth plan

5968 2018-08-01 11:22:52 9. Hair and Scalp Hygiene
The same fungi that cause dandruff also irritate the skin on your forehead and cause acne. Oil from your hair and scalp spreads onto your forehead and result in clogged pores and acne. To get rid of bumps on your forehead, keep your hair and scalp clean.

5974 2018-08-01 11:21:21 I hate getting my oil changed. Pulled up at 6:45 when they open at 7 and I’m still the fourth damn car .

5976 2018-08-01 11:21:20 8. Fuller’s Earth
To help absorb excess oil from the skin, try fuller’s earth, also known as multani mitti. Being a natural absorbent, it helps remove excess oil from oily skin, which in turn helps treat and prevent bumps on the forehead.

5987 2018-08-01 11:19:38 4. Egg Whites
Oily skin is one of the biggest causes of bumps on the forehead, as the forehead falls in the deadly oily T-zone. To prevent excess buildup of oil on your skin, you can use an egg white face mask.

5992 2018-08-01 11:19:18 How does a govt with a proper blueprint for its country in good conscience for example decides to build a refinery in a state that doesn't produce oil, when even secondary school economics tells us that its better to situate production closest to raw materials.
5993 2018-08-01 11:19:07 3. Exfoliation
To keep your forehead free from bumps, it’s important to exfoliate the skin regularly. Exfoliation will help remove dead skin cells, excess sebum (oil) and other impurities that can clog the pores.

6300 2018-08-01 10:20:23 You mean the British public had the guts to be fooled by a bunch of snake oil salesmen promising them a better life after 6 years of tory austerity now who wouldn't vote for that?
6301 2018-08-01 10:20:21 yeah, just a rough estimate. i was expecting more, actually -- to sustain the whole EU on olive oil, at least.
6302 2018-08-01 10:20:17 A time-traveling Ted Cruz tries to persuade Kellyanne Conway that police officers are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Barry Goldwater's ghost
6303 2018-08-01 10:20:17 "The good times.... the bad times... knowing you can always... la la laaaaa" 
Iraq exported 3.543m bpd of crude from its southern ports in July, slightly above the June average, the oil ministry said on Wednesday.

6307 2018-08-01 10:19:53 but that THC oil could be a plan 
6308 2018-08-01 10:19:33 I think Malaysian ought to read this article. We have ciput oil reserve but yet want to be subsidised like the Saudis. Maybe one day Saudis could teach us a lesson two. Reality bites!
6309 2018-08-01 10:19:23 that is quick........thank you Adrian

6311 2018-08-01 10:19:09 Cut the oil, welfare moochers.
6312 2018-08-01 10:19:04 Yeah xD I've been into all natural oils for years now. Although if you have cats, make sure you dilute it and keep it away from their bedding/food/water as it could cause issues. Most people dilute it with water or a carrier oil because it can be harmful on the skin.

6314 2018-08-01 10:18:23 The cost of petrol is set by the government determined by the international oil price determined by the world economy. 

If you want to blame anyone then blame that interaction with the world economy. 

And the world economy is controlled by “whites”?

6323 2018-08-01 10:16:36 Oil is to water as deplorables are to facts. It's pointless.
6324 2018-08-01 10:16:32 At The Sustainable City, we are trying to ensure use as little oil as possible. We are the first Net Zero Energy community in Dubai, with the majority of our energy consumption coming from the solar panels in our city whilst also recycling water and waste.

6335 2018-08-01 10:14:42 I don't know.  But now it's getting special conditioners such as fur oil "with its quick-drying grape seed, anti-inflammatory clary sage seed, and strand-softening jojoba oils, as well as its light citrus scent."
6336 2018-08-01 10:14:33 Happy August! happy HUMP day! Asian markets closed mixed, European trading is down, futures are mixed & crude oil is down. have a great Wednesday!

Do they think it is all of us that are senseless?
6340 2018-08-01 10:14:04 Anong oil Ate? Lagi namin gamit sa bahay Lavander.
6341 2018-08-01 10:13:45 You mean you have some fellow bribe takers who are willing to help you sell our lands to the oil and mining interests, then use a portion of the money for maintenance. Resign, criminal

6348 2018-08-01 10:13:08 My dream was  My class and I went camping (ironically, the people with me, I never seen in my life). We were drinking and having a good time, until the majority decided they wanted to haunt us. Folks set our cabin on fire, and put oil on the stairs in route to our vehicles
6349 2018-08-01 10:13:02 #ANGS doing me very proud, I did say once this moves it will move very fast. 9p to over 35p last time. More assets and more #oil in the kim at Lidsey as well as balcombe and brockham. Happy days

It should be no surprise.. I'd take Reba to Oil City or Bermuda!

~Bullfrog 
6352 2018-08-01 10:12:29 Not really unless there is oil on the water, but again it would burn the oil away and just take some of the water by evaporation. People are...weird.

6363 2018-08-01 10:10:03 Dear @allbarone 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
6364 2018-08-01 10:09:49 The main one I did for a company I legally can't name, but can say is a  chemical is carbon black.  Carbon black is what gives mascara its black color, it's also the byproduct of burnt oil from oil fields.  If ingested or inhaled it can cause significant neurological problems
6365 2018-08-01 10:08:30 The very same people who blame oil company’s probably drive an SUV.
6366 2018-08-01 10:08:24 Great advice, impossible to overstate how important the right oil is for your vehicle!

6369 2018-08-01 10:07:41 It is a roleplaying game set in an victorian-ish industrial city ringed by walls of arcing electricity (to keep out the ghosts and demons). The city is kept lit by "leviathan oil" blood scavenged from giant sea-demons by men & women on ironclad whaling ships.
6370 2018-08-01 10:07:41 Start as you mean to go along ABI?
So I bought 2 doughnuts as per let's start the month on a sweet note and then the doughnuts weren't fresh and I can still taste the oil so I'm like this can't be a metaphor for how August will go abeg. CANNOT BE.

6372 2018-08-01 10:06:46 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
6373 2018-08-01 10:06:40 Diesel engines can run on cooking oil. But I think cooking oil going to be more expensive than French perfume.

6380 2018-08-01 10:04:43 The caretakers claim that international oil prices went up in July is a Blatant Lie. Ogra reported in the summary that prices of HSD and Petrol shud drop by Rs2.41 and 54 paisa per liter respectively in line with international market.
6381 2018-08-01 10:04:24 ok, i did some back-of-the-envelope calculations for olive oil: it takes 76 g to deliver a third of 2000 kcal, that's 27,7 kg per year. hence current production of 2.586.500 t annually could only sustain ~93,4 m vegans.

Ok. Pengguna serum, sila shake well sebelum guna. Serum ye yang shake tu. Sebab kami buat tak masuk emulsifier. Only mixture of 'water' and 'oil'.

Shake well.

Any way you do it though, good luck!

6507 2018-08-01 09:36:16 People also forget that oil market is cyclic due to over and under supply. Also the case with products too. Companies act with a herd mentality all invest at the same time when profits are high. Inevitably by the time all the investment comes to market there is too much capacity

6544 2018-08-01 09:30:53 I'd like to see how this has been modelled.
You mentioned sand in the wheels of trade with the EU in your piece with Adam Boulton and it seems the modelling gives plenty of weight to this sand, but little or zero to any oil in the wheels of domestic and RoW trade.

6730 2018-08-01 08:46:59 Sure. But let’s follow JC’s lead here. He has admitted he was in the wrong. His apology is a bridge, so let’s try and build on that rather than defending what happened and creating more conflict. Let’s not pour oil on the fire, let’s try and put it out. Like JC is trying to do.

Ain't saying your oil well you assessed will not be opened, it will but it won't make difference in term of real cash that the government will get out of that, more so it won't change much in improving the economy now

6754 2018-08-01 08:41:48 Crude oil prices fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2014 as robust global production exceeded demand. After reaching monthly peaks of $112 per barrel (bbl) and $105/bbl in June, crude oil. It was less than $30/bbl in 2016. Hence the sudden downfall of -1.6% in the economy.

6803 2018-08-01 08:29:43 That is for the kleptocrats to celebrate, as for me and many other junubiin, it will not mean much. Sudan is doing all these because they are the primary beneficiaries of the oil proceeds
6804 2018-08-01 08:29:15 The funniest thing is if you look at the oil price during Buhari’s regime, he has gotten more because of the drop in naira. Oil price at 100usd (with dollar at 160 naira) is less than oil price at 70usd with dollar at 360 naira
6805 2018-08-01 08:29:07 I do my best to stick with facts. 
The use of fossil fuels is major issue, but even if we stopped burning oil, we would not see a mark in the atmosphere for close to 100 years. If we stopped producing livestock, we would see effects within a decade. Disturbing ?

6827 2018-08-01 08:24:00 I'm very impressed that you're obviously tweeting this on a PC or mobile phone that you made, yourself, from scratch, mining and refining the ore and oil. How did you manage to make the chips in it, by hand?

6834 2018-08-01 08:22:34 I don’t know exactly what that particular speaker said. I’m uncomfortable with the comparison of Israel = Nazis as it’s often knee-jerk anti-semitism. But that’s not the issue here. The issue is people pouring oil on the fire which the leadership is trying to put out.

6837 2018-08-01 08:22:00 ..THEY, the people exist.

With China now refusing Aus recycling, it'll build up quicker, hence the plastic bag backflip.

7235 2018-08-01 06:54:10 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.  @Rockman2play @ChuddyPeter @AyobamiOjebode
7236 2018-08-01 06:53:53 In The USA, we have a president that doesn’t believe in climate change, has lifted restrictions on many endangered species, allows shooting of hibernating animals, wants to start more offshore oil drilling and wants to close some national parks to sell to private citizens.

7253 2018-08-01 06:50:00 Is it smart to fry foot using olive oil? Yes, it is. The high antioxidant content of olive oil could even reduce the number of harmful chemicals produced during cooking. So make sure you have a bottle in your kitchen shelf always.

7373 2018-08-01 06:24:52 Why is petrol increasing whilst Brent grudge oil is decreasing?
7374 2018-08-01 06:24:47 yeah that’s before they put the oil in it. the oil brings it down like 50%

7391 2018-08-01 06:20:18 Not that every oil change everywhere costs $80, and I’ve experienced that for over a decade. If I got my oil changed at my dealership it would be over $100.

7411 2018-08-01 06:15:43 Excuses and apologies mix together like oil and water. 

Early on, I took note that the language used in his 'apology' is seriously manipulative.

7421 2018-08-01 06:13:54 My understanding is that Russia spills somewhere between 90,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil a DAY due to leaks and spills.  And we are hurting our Canadian oil production so that it is replaced with theirs?  Shame on you @Pembina and @TzeporahBerman.  SHAME.
7422 2018-08-01 06:13:24 An interview with Ala Talabani that took place a month or two ago comes to mind. She openly discussed the corruption in the KRG, illegitimate claims to oil profit, misuse of public funds, etc. If I recall correctly, it was on Sharqiyya TV with Muhammad Mullah Talal.

7508 2018-08-01 05:56:02 Climate change, this terrifying global warming, is THE most important issue that faces all the people, all creatures of Planet Earth. Gold, Oil, Money drives this! You wealthy of the world, do you believe you can live safely in your air conditioned towers, while our Planet burns?
7509 2018-08-01 05:55:54 I agree, save our parks & environment. Before it's too late &the oil barons make it all ugly.

7512 2018-08-01 05:55:20 This is terrifying to consider as the forecast for everywhere oil is drilled and transported.  The utter disregard for the environment is appalling.

7525 2018-08-01 05:53:31 Ooh god, I wouldn’t be mad if you got me chili’s chips and salsa or an oil defuser as gift either. Maybe some batteries (AA) or one of those bottled waters at the store that look fancy but you never buy cuz you know you can just buy Dasani or Aquafina.
7526 2018-08-01 05:53:19 Feet 
Soak your feet in warm water & Apple cider vinegar 

Scrub your feet with sea salt to remove dead skin from your heels 

Salter your feet with oil or s thick cream/shea butter & put on fluffy socks (leave it own overnight)
7527 2018-08-01 05:53:18 Pretty much anything would be an upgrade from oil, but why use an animal when there are other more sustainable, ethical resources
7528 2018-08-01 05:52:56 Retweeted Boason Omofaye (@BBoason):

7564 2018-08-01 05:43:47 India is importing more oil (almost 50%) from Iran. India imported 1.9 million tonnes of #CrudeOil from #Iran in June 2017 & placed orders for 2.82 million tonnes in June 2018.
Main reason:
*Free shipping.
*Extended credit period of 60 days.

Use lip masks

I came across a high temp incinerator in Paris that burned Paris waste and used the waste heat. Why can we not burn burnable waste and convert it to electricity
7598 2018-08-01 05:37:47 Face
Switch to an oil based cleanser/soap Free cleaners (UNLESS Your skin is oily)

Use a gentle exfoliator 1x a week to remove the build up of dry skin 

Toner

Always moisturize 

You can also Try an overnight mask

7623 2018-08-01 05:32:21 Very true. Goran has been losing its stand as a strong opposition to the gov. Nowadays, instead of criticizing the gov, they are trapped into debates over the land Shaswar & others own. This is because their hill is also disputed whereas billions of $ are stolen from oil filleds.
7624 2018-08-01 05:31:43 Also the not often referred to 13cents of that 15 goes to the state governments.   The measure is a money grab hidden behind the Green wall. Meanwhile coal and oil production continues to be sudsidised.  An impact much much greater than even a billion plastic bags has.

7803 2018-08-01 04:59:26 A bunch of grand standing cunning masters of deception who sell their snake oil for the purpose of seizing political power. What better way than to disarm the civilian population?

7809 2018-08-01 04:58:32 Howard’s legacy is like a cancer to our once balanced society. He opened the racist can to be re-elected took us to war & sold everything that wasn’t bolted down during a mining boom   To our shame he spied on East Timor giving them an unfair Oil deal  to our advantage 
7810 2018-08-01 04:58:32 It's August! Success is inevitable!!!  Use wisdom in your everyday affairs and recognize the need for moderation. Get you some olive oil, bless it, and anoint your head, heart, and feet. YES #ELEVATE #HealEverything
7811 2018-08-01 04:58:09 Great scene in Goodfellas. I’m convinced every good mob movie teaches you a little how to cook. Godfather=sauce, Goodfellas=sliced garlic in oil, Godfather 2=genco olive oil, canapés, sandwich on a TV tray, The Sopranos= baked ziti, Godfather 3=gnocchi

7817 2018-08-01 04:56:56 So instead of a beautiful pipeline delivering oil to the coast with very little energy it will take 100’s of trains using tons of diesel. The fake protesters in Burnaby don’t give a shit about the environment. Just Soros paid losers.
7818 2018-08-01 04:56:55 It depends on where you go and how much oil needs to be replaced. I change my own oil, so I don't get ripped off!

7822 2018-08-01 04:56:14 Of course you drill oil sands, only 20% of the resource is recoverable through mining.  In-situ SAGD  oil sands production surpassed mined production in 2012.  Check your facts.
7823 2018-08-01 04:56:12 I'm sure it's just the place you went to. I got my oil changed in NY and it was $80 lol
7824 2018-08-01 04:56:11 Oil prices fell on Wednesday after industry data showed U.S. stockpiles of crude unexpectedly rose, and as economic growth slowed, especially in Asia, amid the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China.

7870 2018-08-01 04:48:03 You’re not wrong about the short term convexity of oil prices (though I would dispute the magnitude you’re implying). You’re wrong about calculating the cost of providing the alternative.
7871 2018-08-01 04:47:53 hey guys it's been 4 days since i burned my house down by cooking with motor oil, whoops
7872 2018-08-01 04:47:52 Nope. My dressing was 2 cloves of grated garlic, the juice of 2 lemons, a dash of red wine vinegar, 1/2c olive oil and a can of chopped/smashed anchovies (with some Romano/Parm sprinkled on afterwards)

 Urals $71.40
 Brent $74.25 (-0.97%)
 WTI   $68.76
7877 2018-08-01 04:47:15 I’ve heard similar but the salaries aren’t attractive relative to the cost of living and there isn’t enough confidence in the oil & gas sector or @albertaNDP for foreign workers to relocate.
7878 2018-08-01 04:47:14 I have come to the conclusion that coconut oil can solve all of my problems. You can use it as a moisturizer, insect repellent, to shave your legs, to cook, to get rid of dandruff, and highlight your cheekbones. 
7879 2018-08-01 04:47:07 Try shea butter or coconut oil

7968 2018-08-01 04:29:39 Every country should boycott the Petrodollar. Don't do business with Petrodollar. Buy oil from non-petrodollar suppliers.
7969 2018-08-01 04:29:07 BrooklynSolar TWT'd: Europe is maxed out, India is blocked, Africa is budding and close, Suadia Arabia and its oil producers are still interested, South America unsettled. Australia!

7972 2018-08-01 04:28:55 A cleansing oil day and night with a moisturizer. If you have facial hair beard balm helps a lot and if you don’t an aftershave type of balm helps as well as drinking plenty of water to hydrate the skin. You can apply aquafor to the red spots to help the healing process
7973 2018-08-01 04:28:53 No joke, there was this paper with a reputable peer review that found 2ml of peppermint oil in 98ml of coconut oil stimulated hair growth better than commercial shit. Worst case scenario is that you smell like peppermint.

7978 2018-08-01 04:27:27 That was a lot of weird and awkward violence that just happened. Maybe oil makes people go crazy. That's probably the point of the movie, like Treasure of the Sierra Madre. #LiveTweetTWBB

7985 2018-08-01 04:26:50 The other day, someone shared a photo of a soap that had most gorgeous shade of purple...dark purple. And she had used stevia root infused in olive oil. Olive oil, always contributes a yellowish -green hue but this colour was really amazing ...

7999 2018-08-01 04:24:52 steam it, sauté it, or roast it in a hot oven with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper (my personal fave)

If you buy a whole bunch, bend one piece until it snaps, that’ll show you how far up to cut the rest so they aren’t woody

If you have any more cooking questions, HMU

8014 2018-08-01 04:21:53 You can use it in recipes that call for solid fats, like clarified butter, ghee, or coconut oil, but flavor will vary depending on degree of cooking. I’d be more inclined to use it in savory applications.

8021 2018-08-01 04:20:46 The second option. It isn’t that much different than letting the Koch Bros, Big Oil, Wall Street, or the NRA buy your elections. The real problem is that our government is for sale. Oligarchs stealing democracy is treason, whether they are foreign or home-grown.
8022 2018-08-01 04:20:27 ....And these are the people who are determining our collective future!Just becoz they are given maize meal, cooking oil & rice they keep voting for this ruinous Zanu PF regime. Elections are useless in Zim. From now on massive street protests is the only way foward!

8029 2018-08-01 04:19:16 talking about WWII ? 100% of the venezuelan oil exports were to fuel the allies armies... Until 1998 Venezuela was the most stable democracy in the region.

There are 800 Oil Pumpers in the Los Angeles city limits and 
4000 Oil Pumpers in the Los Angeles County alone. Think how many in Texas, Oklahoma North Dakota etc etc
Considering how many may be in the entire USA . Makes Alberta seem insignificant.

8045 2018-08-01 04:16:42 Or maybe the crime rate in an oil dependant economic region is a result of NDP policy, and policing won't help when people are desperate?

8047 2018-08-01 04:16:17 and if the company is not explaining to folks adequately (ie the full implications) of what it is doing, then it is taking advantage of their lack of understanding (like snake oil), and profiting from it - treating human beings like lab test subjects

8229 2018-08-01 03:45:11 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8230 2018-08-01 03:45:08 I wish I had some cbd oil 
8231 2018-08-01 03:45:08 Oh right, damn those eco friendly cars that only need their oil changed every 7,000 Miles instead of 3,000, and use gas more efficiently. You don’t sound very educated on that subject.

8235 2018-08-01 03:45:01 The earliest recorded use of lube was actually olive oil used as lube. Oils (including ghee) being used for lube purposes is just common sense

8240 2018-08-01 03:44:11 Oil futures hard for most to figure out. Which is why we have such disparaging forecast from so many experts, one giving us a $40 target, while others giving us a $300 target, one hedge fund lose in the 100 of millions, when making a wrong bet, it only takes 1 wrong bet.

8256 2018-08-01 03:42:04 Ghee as lube is just common sense. They won't use mustard oil as lube, you know (actually, that could be pretty kinky)

8258 2018-08-01 03:41:56 Yeah man let me know, especially if you run at Lucas Oil I’m looking for an excuse to go there.
8259 2018-08-01 03:41:49 The ANC has made the same announcement Venezuela made when they chose to expropriate so-called idle land, and collapsed every part of their economy except oil, which also later tumbled.  Rand lost 16 cents to the dollar immediately. Our economy is set to collapse or suffer.

8280 2018-08-01 03:38:57 Yeah, I thought following a wide spectrum would be good to maintain perspective, but the ad nauseam nonsense is just exhausting at this point.  And, again, the provocateurs profit.  Online bullshit is the 21st century snake oil.

8284 2018-08-01 03:37:50 I have more oily skin so I use a face wash from Cera ve and then I put this olay moisturizer (spf 30&it’s oil free) actually made my face produce less oily. also try and see if there’s a pattern with when you break out
8285 2018-08-01 03:37:49 Re:  Pierre Andurand

From the 4/5/16 WSJ: Andurand Capital Management LLP

Having bet against oil in September 2014, Mr. Andurand’s fledgling fund gained almost 60%—a profit of $160 million—in four months as the price of oil almost halved.

I will say though, if you have a good farmer’s market close by, score yourself some golden beets. Slice thin, and either bake or roast them, even grill them with a bit of olive oil. AMAZING on a burger

8395 2018-08-01 03:24:00 What is the fraction of oil in oilseed Brassicas? @melletang and I were trying to figure it out today.

8397 2018-08-01 03:23:49 A few things the free press gave us: the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906; child labor laws; the dissolution of Standard Oil’s national monopoly; safe working conditions for factory employees

8398 2018-08-01 03:23:33 I remember when ma had us take castor oil. I would only take if she did it too. Whelp after burping fish alllll day after that none of us had it ever again. Found that bottle in the cabinet when she moved years later.

8402 2018-08-01 03:21:56 Fossil Fuels gave us prosperity and raised the quality of life for the world, but now we know of it's negative effects, we should transition to green energy. I'm not demonizing oil workers, they just want to feed their families, but we should transition away from Fossil Fuels.
8403 2018-08-01 03:21:32 Probiotics (the good kind that you keep in the fridge) twice a day, tea tree oil spray (it should already be diluted if in spray form) on your underwear, plain Greek yogurt to eat, lots of water :) 
Stay consistent with this stuff and avoid sugar/bath bombs/scented detergent

8416 2018-08-01 03:20:04 Sounds like exiting NAFTA was a way to punish Mexico for not building the wall and Canada was collateral damage. Canada is our biggest oil supplier what if they hiked the price of oil. Or abandon the pipeline being built from Texas to Canada. Big oil wouldn't like that.
8417 2018-08-01 03:19:54 YESSSS 100% and if you’re feeling extra throw some lemon juice into the coconut oil;)
8418 2018-08-01 03:19:50 Tried to pamper myself by using essential oil in my bath, turns out I'm allergic and now I have a rash.

8427 2018-08-01 03:18:31 おおー！すごい聞きたいことありすぎゆ。。。スマホの民全くいないからじーちゃんうれしいよ。。。
8428 2018-08-01 03:18:28 Standard oil had about 4% of the market share in 1870, their market share didn't grow till they efficiently lowered refining costs (less than 1/10th the cost of production in 1897 as in 1869) & passed that savings on to consumers (from 30¢/Gallon to 5.9¢ from 69' to 97')
8429 2018-08-01 03:18:21 Double when oil was 145 a barrel. Manufacturing has moved out of Alberta due to its high cost of operating So yes the NDP have increased everything and clearly their policies or utopia has failed all Albertans #2019

8441 2018-08-01 03:16:44 これたぶん向こうから何のアクションもないままそのうち時間がたったら何事もなかったように振る舞ってくるんだろうなぁ。
まあ私は言いたいこと言ったし、なんでもいいけどね。
8442 2018-08-01 03:16:06 There was an article showing because of the weak earnings and lack of capital, they expect 500 less rigs in Canada this year. That will only make it harder to find the heavy grades of oil the US refiners need to produce distillates.
8443 2018-08-01 03:16:04 @DrKeithRowley you are rejecting Venezuelan citizen but not our oil. You are a miserable man. Your island got hundreds of benefits from our country for decades. You Dr. Piece of Trash, remember your your bloody words. I will...shame on you.

8445 2018-08-01 03:15:42 I got a pet grade oil specifically for dogs and I put a drop behind Odie’s ears per the directions and the kid is out, snoring.
8446 2018-08-01 03:15:29 Really what are you reading. University and colleges will continue to see enrollment drops of .4 to .7 till at least 2020, inflation has risen to 3.4% due to taxation, fuel prices have risen almost 100% with oil at 69 dollars a barrel

8451 2018-08-01 03:15:08 Or you’ll shut down the government, we know.
Imagine if you’d campaigned on this, the truth, rather than feeding your brain dead worshippers the empty snake oil salesman BS that they continue to gobble up.
You were right, the whole world is laughing at us. Nervously, but laughing
8452 2018-08-01 03:14:49 I recently discovered that China switched its oil purchases to Iraq. This has had a major effect on government funding. There have been demonstrations by ordinary people against conditions, recently re water shortages in a record heatwave.
8453 2018-08-01 03:14:47 It just a draft . stop rumor mongering...and adding oil to fire
8454 2018-08-01 03:14:28 Micah & I had a gritty/neotokyo/grunge AU where Shiro steps outside of his shop into a back alley to get rid of some cooking oil and promptly sees an unconscious Keith getting thrown into literal TRASH & that's how he gets his boyfriend; from the trash
8455 2018-08-01 03:14:14 Wild growth hair oil works WONDERS! If you can stand the smell I recommend for all big chop gals and all natural gals.
8456 2018-08-01 03:14:13 Except we AREN'T prospering.  Only the rich benefit from the tax cuts. WE are paying MORE for everything that we use to survive. Gas, food, building supplies, animal feed, household cleaners, fuel oil to heat our homes, have ALL gone up substantially!! But our pay hasn't!
8457 2018-08-01 03:14:05 A high quality EVOO beats hands-down all other oils: 75-85% of oleic fatty acids, ~10x Omega-6/Omega-3 ratio, smoke point >470F, Vitamin E > 200mg/Kg and unique Bio-phenols > 500mg/kg... any other oil even close? Expensive? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely! But...

8461 2018-08-01 03:12:53 But still, the word 'Palm' has got a mentioning in the ingredients. Although, cottonseed oil is a good alternative, and is majorly used in snacks; daalmoth for instance
8462 2018-08-01 03:12:03 Ive literally been putting coconut oil and lotions on my belly since the early part of my pregnancy and have ended up with so many stretch marks on the front of my stomach. How does yours look so good #jealous

8475 2018-08-01 03:09:16 Having a cold really sucks, but it's like getting the oil changed in your car. It's necessary every so often to flush out your system and get rid of all that accumulated, clogged up shit. And once you're on the other side of it, you feel AMAZING.

8489 2018-08-01 03:07:31 Shale is like a whole different commodity than oil (WTI and Brent)
Reason being, it contains no middle distillates. This is a known, which is why we see discounts.
8490 2018-08-01 03:07:24 I've been sold by my colleagues!!! I'm buying my own essential oil diffuser!!!

8498 2018-08-01 03:05:58 I recently got a crap ton of oil pastels and was like how tf do they work?
8499 2018-08-01 03:05:41 Betul masbroo. Selain teknologi baru pada lapangan pengembangan, hasil dari eksplorasi cekungan baru juga menambah jumlah cadangan. Kayak di US malah belakangan mengambil Shale oil, yg bisa dibilang bukan hidrokarbon di reservoirnya lagi tetapi langsung ambil ke 'source rock'nya.

8507 2018-08-01 03:05:02 An avocado with olive oil and salt is, dare I say it, pretty good.
8508 2018-08-01 03:04:56 BTW, f you haven't tried it  *sliver* beet is delicious - steamed with olive oil and garlic.
8509 2018-08-01 03:04:45 Headed towards higher oil prices, allowing greater profits for Russia, just as planned???

8511 2018-08-01 03:04:20 BIO OIL?!?!?!
8512 2018-08-01 03:04:05 IMO = large diesel demand = increase in demand for non shale oil
IMO = price increase for WTI and Brent, large discount for shale
Shale discount large = hard for shale cos to keep drilling and borrowing
Shale oil may stay at 65 while WTI and Brent are at 100
8513 2018-08-01 03:04:05 Drill baby drill. The US is now the largest producer of oil!

8516 2018-08-01 03:03:50 I used to party like a rockstar. Now the only pills I take are fish oil, and the only time I strip is during a hot flash (while loudly complaining to my cats that Bubble Witch is most definitely rigged and I should be past this level by now)

8519 2018-08-01 03:03:31 Just ran out of my peppermint essential oil.......I can't live without it. SOS
8520 2018-08-01 03:03:31 You gonna have to ask #skincaretwitter but I feel like this probably increases oil production bc it’s stripping your skin.
8521 2018-08-01 03:03:28 @willafrej Do the Kochs oppose the border, so they can have cheaper labor workers? And pay what they should pay, for their share of taxs, when  oil is moved around the world, on pipeline's throughout?

8524 2018-08-01 03:02:48 If you are in the oil sands you have been largely isolated from anything that resembles reality. Reality is its still very slow as a handful of oil companies have chosen to spend their money to drill in the US rather than Canada. Big companies Shell Conoco Repsol etc.
8525 2018-08-01 03:02:47 Got a deep condition & hot oil treatment, my scalp feels great 
8526 2018-08-01 03:02:47 Me finding true love is like mixing water and oil. 
8527 2018-08-01 03:02:38 that is very eloquently put! For me, the more natural outcome is likely to be in china's favor - Brics and other economies are all pushing in the same direction as china - think it goes beyond currencies into remaking financial order .. love ur work on xau/usd/cny/oil!!
8528 2018-08-01 03:02:30 I just bought some coconut oil and I have sushi party. #wannaPlayAGame?
8529 2018-08-01 03:02:28 Am wondering how this would affect me because am a breast cancer survivor and my cancer was estrogen positive. Probably, I need to stop using this oil.
8530 2018-08-01 03:02:11 muffin tin (or cupcake tin) and put a fairly thin-ish layer in, maybe a third full! And yes, if the oil is hot enough they rise like that :)
8531 2018-08-01 03:01:56 Tony Blair.. who failed in that promise to ban zero hours contracts. Where is our oil fund Richard what did Labour do with all that oil tax cash?
8532 2018-08-01 03:01:55 I am absolutely convinced that people who enjoy the smell of tea tree oil huff pinesol
8533 2018-08-01 03:01:44 Thjios is just more of your twisting of reality #JasonKenney. #oilprice has not even remotely reached levels of pre-2015 and PRE NDP government  but you gloss over that. Big Oil isn't comingh back because WOLRDF oil prices are still low and Alberta crude sells at a discount.
8534 2018-08-01 03:01:17 Sweetheart , it’s easy to say that when you are financially secure. When you are 60yrs young with 40 yrs of Oilfield experience and laid off and NO Oil company will hire you because they state you are too Old. It’s totally Depressing watching yourself lose everything. SAD.

8538 2018-08-01 03:00:52 As of today, I've had four things fall off my motorcycle while riding it. The handlebar end, the shifter, the oil drain plug (survived that one thankfully), and today's: one of the bolts for the kickstand.
8539 2018-08-01 03:00:45 Shale has no middle distillate. You run it in the front of the refinery, and get no diesel, because it does not exist... IMO 2020 will increase demand for diesel, causing a large discount for shale oil. The Shale discount causes less shale, and there is not enough non shale oil

8548 2018-08-01 03:00:03 Pulpo a la gallega (Galician-style octopus) , is cooked in boiling water (preferably in a copper cauldron or pan) and served hot in oil
8549 2018-08-01 03:00:02 Yes. Canada must reduce its dependence on unethical foreign oil.

8551 2018-08-01 02:59:59 But, Block One income is not ARR as Pomp was likely pointing out. Bitmain’s revenue is closer to a oil and gas MLP’s revenue stream which likely is a smarter tax structure for miners if in US.

8553 2018-08-01 02:59:53 depends on who she is talking to, she has a "public position" for potential voters and a "private position" for Wall St, defense industry, and big oil donors
8554 2018-08-01 02:59:45 Shale has done a great job of postponing the inevitable which is we are consuming much more oil that we are producing. Think many people are going to be disappointed to find out shale production can't be sustained.
8555 2018-08-01 02:59:35 Despite the recent surge in oil prices, Exxon Mobil ( $XOM | USD81.51, ↓0.27%) and Chevron ( $CVX | USD126.27, ↓1.22%) missed earnings estimates. $XLE (USD77.05, ↓0.27%) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of US energy companies in the S&P 500.

IN MAY 2014 ONGC COMPLAINED THAT MUKESH AMBANI IS STEALING GAS FROM ITS TWO FIELDS. 

OIL MINISTY FORMED AP SHAH COMMISSION WHICH SAID AMBANI GAINED RS 10540 CR AND MUST PAY IT TO ONGC. 

AMBANI SAID NO.
8558 2018-08-01 02:59:00 Understood. My point based on fact that repetition doesn't just change minds, it changes brains. Luntz - funded by Big Oil 2 forestall laws unfavorable 2 them - got research showing "Climate Change" less alarming. Rs in unison repeated it. They won. No meaningful change occurred.
8559 2018-08-01 02:58:46 I use a beard wash, beard balm, and beard oil. And I get it trimmed by a barber every few weeks. ART.

8588 2018-08-01 02:55:42 I couldn’t go full oil just yet but so far it’s amazing for the kind of detail i fo. Idky i let ppl talk me out of trying it lol
8589 2018-08-01 02:55:41 Those jobs aren't coming back. They were the fat our bloated oil companies trimmed. Kenney hates capitalist effenciency.
8590 2018-08-01 02:55:26 BOE is not OIL and Condensate is not OIL
The WTI re-write in 1/19 and IMO 2020 in 1/2020 will make the world realize this. Even if Iran is playing nice and all their oil is on the market, it wont save the spike. Trump needs to look at China import game and place the blame now.
8591 2018-08-01 02:55:25 Bad behavior; It happens all the time to crooked people (business, politicians, snake oil salesmen...) they get paid before anyone finds out and there are no repercussions.
8592 2018-08-01 02:55:22 LOL Ive been obsessed with different herbal teas lately. But I like to pick one essential oil, learn its properties and use it to treat different, simple things (headache, body pain) A lot of success with peppermint oil-potent pain reliever and it works wonders!
8593 2018-08-01 02:55:18 Its olive oil
8594 2018-08-01 02:55:10 im still not over the episode of queer eye were antoni literally put slices of avocado and grapefruit on a plate with olive oil. thats all he did the whole episode. why is he on the show
8595 2018-08-01 02:55:01 Fuel subsidy depleted our oil earnings so much. This government has been able to balance the decrease  in oil revenue by increasing fuel price by almost 100% @JoyceOdukoya did a detailed analysis on this at a time. Unlike 2015 falsehood propagated thru data must be diffused
8596 2018-08-01 02:54:38 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks advanced as trade optimism lifted industrial shares and tech companies staged a recovery. Oil sank and the dollar gained.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell about one basis point to 2.95 percent.
8597 2018-08-01 02:54:12 Shale started high grading in early 15, nearly out of tier 1 rocks. Gas and Water prod are soaring, most permian thats left is wet as hell, costs lots to produce water. The next oil price spike is US Shale related, caused largely by IMO 2020 and the WTI re-write.

8617 2018-08-01 02:51:45 If we had followed the UK gov mentality at the time the oil would still be there, undeveloped. Because: it’s Scotland. It can’t be true, it’s useless, & it’s not worth it.
8618 2018-08-01 02:51:44 Dulu sering denger "10tahun lagi minyak bumi indonesia akan habis!", knp sampai skrg ga habis2? Krn teknologi utk nyedot oil jg berkembang.

Temen dari Duri cerita, di chevron riau itu pake eor Injected Steam biar oil 'kentel' yg dulu 'ga mungkin' disedot, kini jd mungkin.

8633 2018-08-01 02:50:28 Its simple, you put money out with hopes of return. They lie about EUR to show potential for return. Debt is maxed, many are outside covenants, and can't drill to battle decline. Their oil is discounted to WTI, they lie again and say its takeaway capacity,

We are not a rich country and whatever we are earning from oil cannot meet our infrastructure needs simply because of our population and import dependence.
8637 2018-08-01 02:49:58 You want a job in the oil and gas industry?
8638 2018-08-01 02:49:49 How about another pipeline? On that instead of distributing oil for profits distributed water for humans in the U.S.? Where the melts and floods endanger homes and live, engineer drains that feed into a national network of pipes that take overflow water to under flow regions?
8639 2018-08-01 02:49:45 running out of oil carts and juul pods at the same time puts a big hole in my heart but revitalizes my lungs

8648 2018-08-01 02:49:17 Agreed. I think that professional practitioners should make efforts to see their patients holistically, actually listen to them and find methods that work for them. 

Are there some complementary treatments that are snake oil? Yes, but that’s a different issue.
8649 2018-08-01 02:49:15 im still in awe because this looks like oil paint <3

8656 2018-08-01 02:48:28 I make sure to wash my hair and oil my scalp with a moisturizer or my tea tree oil! Your scalp will end up dry and flaky as hell if you don’t take care of it.. flakes will fall everywhere as soon as you put a brush to your head.

8662 2018-08-01 02:47:45 Maybe someone has already mentioned this but perhaps hemp oil? It's kind of tough b/c you don't exactly know what you're getting online. I just got some for one of my dogs that targets pain & inflammation & it has been studied. Thinking of trying it myself. Feel free to DM.

Is big oil flying the airplane transporting you to YOUR vacation destination?
Is big oil the one using any of the petroleum based products YOU use or your home and family utilize?

8688 2018-08-01 02:43:52 My dad swears a racoon trap and sardines in water (not oil) is the best way to trap, if needed. Good luck! May the odds be ever in your favor.
8689 2018-08-01 02:43:38 Not sure but looked pretty full to me.  Not like his inauguration crowd  of course.... Seriously, too many follow this snake  oil salesman.  So sad he has them so fooled.
8690 2018-08-01 02:43:35 Actually, I was old enough to remember the OPEC oil embargo. Nasty it was. I also remember Carter led the country in information and help for mental illness.

8693 2018-08-01 02:42:39 Essential oil diffuser. I haven't tested different ones to narrow it down, I just only use it with the door closed and him out of the room now. Our other cat will literally stick her face in it and she's fine  poor dobby was the runt though so he's always had issues
8694 2018-08-01 02:42:25 Yep, and a world surplus of natural gas and oil. It’s just terrible..
8695 2018-08-01 02:42:11 i’ve made many mistakes in my life but at least putting coconut oil on my face is not one of them
8696 2018-08-01 02:41:54 basic pancake batter! heat up oil in oven and then cook for like 20 minutes or something!!!!
8697 2018-08-01 02:41:48 A bitch is tired of putting coconut oil on my own back. I need help! Shit.
8698 2018-08-01 02:41:47 What is it so unique about oil/gasoline related theft/malfeasance so that any investigation and/or court hearing cannot be done in a reasonable time span? Is it because of who the dirt bags are??
8699 2018-08-01 02:41:47 but remember that peppermint oil head massage Kimberly gave me when I had that terrible migraine? that was essential

8713 2018-08-01 02:40:10 Prediction:  Amazon will become the new gas station/convenient store but with electric pumps instead of gas.  We don’t see it happening, but they are doing everything that points to this direction.  
Their next casualty will be oil companies.
8714 2018-08-01 02:40:08 No pipeline problem. Decline problem. We haven't maxed permian lines yet. Look at EIA April and May Prod. I would guess the flat continues for all of 18. WTI is going to soar. Demand is growing, won't slow until oil over 120 for 6 months. (Takes time and $ to trade the SUV.)
8715 2018-08-01 02:40:05 Too all the @NDP haters. The TM pipeline already exists. Oil flows to Burnaby everyday. Lets be crystal clear to the @UCP wannabe voters. Its an expansion of the existing line. Expansion. Say that word several times so you really understand.
8716 2018-08-01 02:40:02 You forgot Castrol oil
8717 2018-08-01 02:40:02 I know you kidding lol I got a pretty cool Oil lantern and rocking chair last weekend, we do need to get together soon though

8720 2018-08-01 02:39:49 Canada is NOT falling apart....better to  invest current government subsidies to  dinosaur gas and oil in green, sustainable renewables ....
8721 2018-08-01 02:39:43 Yet he still has the sanctions on Putin and is forming a middle eastern nato type alliance to cripple Putins oil sales to countries,,,I would call that standing up x2 compared to what Obama did...come on @NancyPelosi you can do better than this.
8722 2018-08-01 02:39:32 Corn oil? Not olive oil???
8723 2018-08-01 02:39:31 it was also oil

8733 2018-08-01 02:37:59 Starkeville to Honolulu is oil and water.
8734 2018-08-01 02:37:52 Smoking/vaping is more of an immediate relief. High cbd strains can help a lot. Edibles work too, they’ll last a little longer than smoking will but they take awhile to get on top of the pain. Rick Simpson Oil is the best option though! Strongest by far
8735 2018-08-01 02:37:42 Well mine not that big but I can bring out the baby oil

8739 2018-08-01 02:37:08 The pipeline exist already. Its 1 line. Understand. They are 3x the capacity. Oil has been flowing for 40 years already. Kenney lies. The pipeline sends oil to Burnaby ever minute of the day. Think 1billion. 3 billion.
8740 2018-08-01 02:36:57 오오
8741 2018-08-01 02:36:51 And then one day you find yourself popping fish oil and multivitamins like the bad ass that you are.
8742 2018-08-01 02:36:45 Also a 1/2019 effective date on a re-write on WTI contract to cause the high API oil to not quality for WTI, look at US production increase by API, lot of High API (Super Light, Condensate Type) Oil

8748 2018-08-01 02:35:34 I asked my dad to teach my how to check the oil in my car and he says to me “ya I’ll be home by 4 so be home then” he wouldn’t start until 7:30.
8749 2018-08-01 02:35:31 Shareholders are imp for the oil industry but it is a free market. How much longer can we subsidize the profits of the oil industry? We are in major debt that is being amortized over generations of debt slaves. Of course the dollar not backed by gold so worthless so maybe stuck.
8750 2018-08-01 02:35:30 don't need prageru ads appear on my youtube feed 24/7. i don't need to hear what some oil fracking industry executive giving terrible political stuff shoving aside racism and homophobia as just useless buzzwords in order to protect the republican party to protect the company lol

8763 2018-08-01 02:32:58 And fertilizers pesticides and food transportation are all oil based. Oil is finite resource. You cannot make fertilizer or food from electricity, so renewables are no option for human health. As population and consumer demand grows, it happens at expense of  the landbase.
8764 2018-08-01 02:32:50 Move all the oil to the Antarctica!

8784 2018-08-01 02:30:10 Owning the libs isn’t a platform. Maybe talk about tax breaks for rich, making it easier to get assault weapons, continuing to sabotage new energy development and jobs all to carry a dying oil industry. Can’t sell that? Get better ideas.

8794 2018-08-01 02:28:33 ...ang daming pwede makipag joint venture sa oil exploration, wag sa may interest sa area. kapag nagkaipag explore kayo sa China, at nakita nila kung gaano kadami ang potensyal na makukuha. at maisipang brasuhin nila tayo wat wag na hatiaan, may magagawa ba ang Pinas?
8795 2018-08-01 02:28:16 Keratin and a good keratin oil serum (or mist)
8796 2018-08-01 02:28:15 I haven't investigated where the money goes from the C tax other than checking that major amounts go to the oil industry which is unfair. The oil industry should pay for it's own innovation. And it's own liabilities like the orphan well program. We're being ripped off in AB. PCs.
8797 2018-08-01 02:28:10 But for the record my feelings about billionaires:
1) There shouldn’t be any
2) Nobody should have a billion dollars
3) If you have to rank the trustworthiness of billionaires in order to understand the world, I’d lean away from the evil cartoon oil barons

8811 2018-08-01 02:26:54 I'd rather drink Castor Oil!! 
8812 2018-08-01 02:26:52 I’m just gonna keep spreadin the good word of Primally Pure because it is unreal. Not even like “oh I don’t smell like anything” but like full day of work, just worked out for 2 hours sweating A LOT, and I smell like fresh ass coconuts and tea tree oil 
8813 2018-08-01 02:26:48 When the oil is up you will me at the bottom again
8814 2018-08-01 02:26:43 The wild savings. I’m still not over this essential oil diffuser/humidifier I got for $5.
8815 2018-08-01 02:26:41 Think of the potential for utility tokens as digital fuel/oil to power applications, compute, storage, etc... not as a digital gold/metal...
8816 2018-08-01 02:25:56 I cannot contain my suspense if they found oil or not!
8817 2018-08-01 02:25:37 *HIGHEST FAAC ALLOCATION IN NIGERIAN'S HISTORY*

A total of N821.86 billion was shared in July to FG, States and Local Governments for the month of June, 2018.

This is the highest disbursement in Nigeria's history even when the Barrel of Crude oil was $120 per Barrel.
8818 2018-08-01 02:25:36 They sure are, Brad!
8819 2018-08-01 02:25:29 Yes!  And that’s why we stay out of those fields...and why i like oil rigs and solar panels.

8821 2018-08-01 02:25:03 Can Kendrick please out castor oil on his beard?
8822 2018-08-01 02:25:02 I’m sure you have heard of eucalyptus oil? It’s used worldwide for colds & sinus issues. Eucalyptus leaves are the main foods that Koalas eat. No I haven’t heard of the Snullygaster, I googled it and I see it’s a dragon-like beast from American folklore.
8823 2018-08-01 02:24:51 So I added some castor oil to my locs and skipped right over the ugly stages. Turns out my shit just needed a little moisture.
8824 2018-08-01 02:24:50 You mean CBD oil and other cannabis-derived remedies they’ve been suppressing for damn near a century now?
8825 2018-08-01 02:24:26 おはよー
8826 2018-08-01 02:24:12 You do understand property taxes, what you are likely referring to are local?  You do understand that Oil jobs are great paying jobs? You do understand this?
8827 2018-08-01 02:24:11 truffle oil is just supposed to give you a suggestion of truffle lol
8828 2018-08-01 02:24:06 isn't that located right off the shores of the Gulf of Oil?
8829 2018-08-01 02:24:05 Hmm
I think it may have been something else. Did you go to some local oil shop or the dealer?
8830 2018-08-01 02:23:58 きょうやばい。すごいあつい
8831 2018-08-01 02:23:48 personally I think chickpeas are great w a combo of curry powder, salt pepper and yogurt and using coconut oil to cook
8832 2018-08-01 02:23:48 อยากได้ อยากมี อยากได้ดีเหมือนคนอื่น อย่าหยุดโพสขายวนไปขายง่ายๆเหมือนปลอกกล้วย
8833 2018-08-01 02:23:45 so if that person has some shit with truffle oil and no actual truffle, of course nothing was added to the meal, you didn’t have any goddamn truffle
8834 2018-08-01 02:23:42 My favorite “essential oil” is bacon grease!
8835 2018-08-01 02:23:39 Couldn't even be bothered to read it when I saw the tweet and it's premise. 
8836 2018-08-01 02:23:20 Why did it take me this long to take an essential oil bath. I’m so relaxed
8837 2018-08-01 02:23:20 Features include: "High walls, sturdy portcullis, bins for heated oil on the walls, and close by river for night escapes upstream."
8838 2018-08-01 02:22:43 Go buy some wild growth oil & castor oil & pray every night 
8839 2018-08-01 02:22:07 *Oil posts worst monthly decline in 2 years, sinking 7.3% to end July at $68.76*

Oil prices fell on Tuesday, pushing crude benchmarks to their largest monthly decline in two years *as OPEC's output appeared to reach a 2018 high in July.*
8840 2018-08-01 02:22:05 Basically,US just wanna gets cheap Iran’s oil no mae how n they wanna trade weapons to arabian countries because of IRI boogeyman. In conclusion IRI isn’t expired, so they will make a deal.However everything could be happen from now to negotiations time for us.#WeStandWithPahlavi
8841 2018-08-01 02:21:52 For real. I'm going to drop a knowledge bomb on you. You can stay in excalibur for like 40 bucks a night and it's so old and no one cares that we even set up a slip and slide in the room with shaving cream and baby oil. Some people come to sleep. I come party.
8842 2018-08-01 02:21:27 I don't really like or support this but want to say that we should ready to eat a lot of soybeans; soybean salad, bread, cereal, tofu, oil, carwash detergent, toothpaste, etc..
8843 2018-08-01 02:21:19 あ、もうそういう案出てたか(  ˙罒˙ )
8844 2018-08-01 02:21:11 promises fall from your mouth like you were spitting up oil, desperate to expunge it from your throat, from the pit of your stomach. you meant it, but it hurt. it burned.
8845 2018-08-01 02:21:07 but, baby, if you can’t read me when my head down & i’m not looking you in the eye, shutting down like a last-lick oil lamp, i don’t know if you’ll ever know you’ve just missed the realest me
8846 2018-08-01 02:21:06 DC probably. I buy juice  (oil) for my pen
8847 2018-08-01 02:20:56 I stay losing my oil cartridge smh I should just stop smoking them
8848 2018-08-01 02:20:55 My mom still uses holy oil to pray 
8849 2018-08-01 02:20:37 Lol, she was using what may have been coconut oil to remove her mascara so it started getting black.
8850 2018-08-01 02:20:26 I love data. It is one of those things you can actually use to hoodwink folks to submission. It is easy to manipulate people with data. This data is simple barrels of oil exported × unit price. Gross price not profit after expenditure. That is first thing to consider.
8851 2018-08-01 02:20:24 I feel like there’s a good chance that coconut oil could cure my depression
8852 2018-08-01 02:20:07 Yup!  Male cottony cushion scale. 
Can treat with predatory beetle or spray tree with white oil and confidor.
8853 2018-08-01 02:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

8858 2018-08-01 02:19:27 Im going to ignore the fact that you used the word "moist" but almonds are high in fat, which is why in baking its probably too wet because most recipes also call for an oil or butter, maybe cut down on those quantities since the almonds in the flour already have some?

8864 2018-08-01 02:18:26 How could a reputable company punch itself in the eye, slap the faces of cutomers, and urinate on the One Buffalo Owners all at the same time - well they can if their CEO gets drunk and played by a phony snake oil salesman like Brandon.

8868 2018-08-01 02:17:52 So this is gross. But I have had a minor toe fungus on a toenail I lost 5 years ago and I’ve tried tea tree oil, OTC medicine, some weird medicine off Amazon and you get it. I’ve tried listerine soaks and vinegar. NOTHING has helped. My doctor wouldn’t give me medicine.

8882 2018-08-01 02:15:30 Antonio picked out this salad dressing and ugh it’s soooo goooood. It’s like a red wine olive oil one. So fucking good. And avocados just make every salad so much better

8884 2018-08-01 02:15:24 @ZacharyLevi Have been researching the CBD oils and offered a position selling them. My mom had RA and I had her try the oil for 2 weeks...but I didn't see improvement. Does it take longer? Also...can it depress you? Help me if you can. Thanks!
8885 2018-08-01 02:15:24 If you think describing it as "oil ice cream" is going to make it less appetizing to me then you are sorely mistaken, my friend.

8892 2018-08-01 02:14:09 Calgarys vacancy rate also reflects the amount of new square footage that has come online. These projects were in the planning/building stages before oil dipped. So if you are looking at that as an economic indicator then beware of what it implys.

9019 2018-08-01 01:56:04 How is that in any way relevant to this discussion? I have been working to reduce our dependence on oil but acknowledge that we will still rely on oil for the foreseeable future.

9026 2018-08-01 01:55:02 The solenoids take signals from the ECU to adjust the cam shaft to change valve timing in real time.  There’s an intake and an outlet for the oil.  The timing is driven by oil pressure, so if a solenoid fails and can’t let in or let out the right amount, ECU code.

9053 2018-08-01 01:51:16 what was the pie like? Do they use palm oil (I'm allergic)?
9054 2018-08-01 01:51:09 Organic coconut oil is the hair bestfriend. Sugarbear gummy is truly good or u can change it to biotin + multivitamins. Don’t forget the collagen for the face and the conditioner after the shower. 
P.s. The triple crownies shouldn’t be forgotten (sleep well, eat , drink water)
9055 2018-08-01 01:50:53 Nope. It's rice or talc powder. Absorbs some oil, helps maintain blown dry hairstyles, esp those not using product (see Gordon Hayward).

It's not an absolute sub for shower shampoo, residue does build up, but it can help keep hair healthier and easier to style.

My counselor made me text my ex for closure. Good thing he gave me some essential oil to calm my ass prior. 
9069 2018-08-01 01:47:24 the absolute irony is that we changed out oil today
9070 2018-08-01 01:47:17 Bolivia y Venezuela están con cero planeamiento estratégico de largo plazo en gas & oíl. Realmente hacen las cosas sin visión de largo plazo. Cero políticas publicas.

9073 2018-08-01 01:47:04 Finally! About time eco-terrorists are held accountable! These eco-terrorists are anti-oil but continue to use oil based products, including transportation. Their hypocrisy is astounding! All of them, big on talk in public but fail to see non-petroleum options are sorely limited.
9074 2018-08-01 01:47:04 Oil drilling meets Bible thumping.
9075 2018-08-01 01:47:02 The oil money so sadly enough blinded the eyes of every human rights organization in the world nobody hear us here and nobody even wants to help!

9077 2018-08-01 01:46:46 my gut reaction is that that sets a dangerous precedent (state autonomy and whatnot)

disband?  maybe that's too strong.

and what if the states don't even have any oil to steal?
9078 2018-08-01 01:46:43 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9079 2018-08-01 01:46:27 You better believe I bought 5 bottles of Bertolli extra virgin olive oil back in 2012 believing it was a product of Italy

9082 2018-08-01 01:45:58 My pleasure.  There is a book "The Secrets of Sherwood Forest:  Oil Production in England During WWII"  written by Guy Woodward and Grace Steele Woodward 1973  Great story.  Great Americans.

9084 2018-08-01 01:45:36 I see news everyday about Russia interfering and threatening the security of the USA.
Let's end all business with Russia. Don't buy a drop of oil from them or sell them one grain of corn.
If we keep on acting cowardly that way  we have been doing they will take over this country.

9087 2018-08-01 01:45:21 Agak sedikit heran sama brand face oil. Mereka jual face oil lohhhh, kenapa botol kacanya bening? Apakah mereka merasa semua pembeli mereka tau kalau face oil gak boleh kena matahari?

9092 2018-08-01 01:44:48 I bet about 40 years ago it was a 3 car garage too!  Now it’s probably so old, and decrepit that your couldn’t get an oil change

9094 2018-08-01 01:44:37 Blair, you do realize how silly it looks to argue against that *reducing* our consumption of oil will also *reduce* the amount of oil that leaks, and that `reducing* our consumption of oil lets us eliminate dangerous modes of transportation and not further expand pipelines?

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9101 2018-08-01 01:43:53 I had printed off one time about Uncle Walter being on the US Arizona and having to swim under water to keep from burning due to the oil from the other ships being on fire. And later became the Sherriff of Berrien County for 25 years. Wtf has her family done? Not shit!
9102 2018-08-01 01:43:35 Today I had a woman complain that her salt and OIL scrub was too oily when she opened it.. and that no one warned her that was going to be oily. #masonvillethings
9103 2018-08-01 01:43:02 I actually watched about 80 games last year. Stats are stats and also tell a pretty compelling story for the goaltending position. I guess you haven't been around the Oil long enough to know that 2 seasons ago was actually the one that hasn't been like the others.
9104 2018-08-01 01:42:49 I used to work at Jersey Mikes and we got so many rude customers and we wished we could swing on them they were so rude. Cursing us out because we didnt add enough oil and shit like that
9105 2018-08-01 01:42:39 someone send me Chipotle and a random bottle of truffle oil thank you I love you
9106 2018-08-01 01:42:36 That coconut oil be low key making my nose burn
9107 2018-08-01 01:42:34 The reason we have to buy the oil back is because of regional issues. If we had a pipeline  that was connected to every region Canada could fully sustain itself on it's own oil. I'm not aware of either party endorsing a trans-canadian pipeline, just KM and KeyXL. Both are export.

I guess I need to come up with an exercise plan.

9134 2018-08-01 01:38:55 As a Nebraskan, I ask you seriously, do you know that what you’re peddling is pollution, oil spills, destruction of best farming land in our country, threatening our largest aquifer, desecrating sacred lands? Would you want this pipeline in your community?
9135 2018-08-01 01:38:51 Collateral Damage sounds like an insurance report claim for a mini-van vs pickup truck fender bender in a McDonald’s parking lot.

125 years ago is not relevant to today. I know what party got us in the two wars we're in now though.

We do pay for it with taxes...which is more important than wars for oil.

You're an idiot.

9159 2018-08-01 01:34:57 So we're officially dumb. The entire scary noise groom my car was it telling me it needed oil!
9160 2018-08-01 01:34:52 Kept my complaining to a minimum on here due to the word count. What I left out was that I started this weeks ago during an oil change and I was called back for the first time today. My "Adviser" dropped the ball big time. Bad service with an even worse solution. What a letdown!
9161 2018-08-01 01:34:42 Also try using jojoba oil or jojoba oil based products as it is the closest oil to our natural body oils. It absorbs better into skin instead of sitting on top clogging the follicles.
9162 2018-08-01 01:34:38 He owes Russia & Putin & he is profiting from being President. There are a # Of lawsuits regarding that.

9191 2018-08-01 01:29:19 It did a little actually! I filled the tub and also put peppermint oil in and soaked with the towel on my neck. It’s definitely less noticeable
9192 2018-08-01 01:29:16 My Mustang was a stick shift too. Every time I put gas in it, I had to put oil in it too. It constantly needed to have parts replaced. Very expensive. My next car, a Buick had issues too. We started buying Toyotas and Hondas...no extra oil needed and low maintenance costs too.
9193 2018-08-01 01:29:11 @DrKeithRowley    of course; receiving oil and dollars in exchange for the support of the government of his country. I will never accept that a shitty Trinidadian humiliates a national of my country, we were the most kind and generous South American country,
9194 2018-08-01 01:29:08 Except oil hasn't really come back, even with the upswing in prices. Those O&G jobs just aren't there anymore and don't pay near the same wage due to automation, and companies realizing they renewable is the future.

9204 2018-08-01 01:27:45 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9205 2018-08-01 01:27:36 And now there's no market for toilet paper there because it's cheaper to wipe with their currency.  Tell me, what are the golden years of Venezuela prior to the recent oil collapse?
9206 2018-08-01 01:27:29 Aw fuk. I put coconut oil on my hair today but how my train carriage just smells like coconut. Whoops
9207 2018-08-01 01:27:25 She’s so adorable. Kinky Curly Knot today or shea butter mixed coconut oil or olive oil and water.

9211 2018-08-01 01:26:47 Seems Chatty Cathy is in the water purification biz...but is an expert in oil & gas...little does he know how little he actually DOES know about the oil & gas industry. #hubbyownsoil&gasbiz #38yearsinthebiz #keepwithwhatyouknow
9212 2018-08-01 01:26:44 Rubbed some frankincense oil on my feet
9213 2018-08-01 01:26:23 I’m not sure if I’m crazy but castor oil made my lashes shorter? Like I still have them but they’re not long enough to be curled by a curler
9214 2018-08-01 01:25:34 4 things that will change your body and skin. Fruit, veggies, water and coconut oil. 
9215 2018-08-01 01:25:24 I would also think the oil spills have had a negative impact on the pH balance of the water there. Add the warm temps and you've got quite a potion to kill the ocean.
9216 2018-08-01 01:25:24 Am I the only one who likes to cook with butter?  vegetable oil tastes too bland, and Pam tastes too chemical ... I just like the idea of enjoying my food 
9217 2018-08-01 01:24:55 Which gulf oil spill? The Gulf of Alaska oil spill in ‘89? I remember that one clearly because I lived in Alaska at the time.
9218 2018-08-01 01:24:32 Soft skin? Coconut oil. Healthy fats? Coconut oil. Enslave the souls of those who have wronged you? Coconut oil.
9219 2018-08-01 01:24:16 Went on a shopping comparison spree:  CBD Hemp Oil.  Glad I am with this company, great products and best prices so far.
9220 2018-08-01 01:24:16 Howards Iraq start marched against. Middle E shd've been isolated. Under 13's let out all else left to fight it out for winner. No aid zero in or out. Our involve re greedy west oil co's & US export of arms to solve deficit. Now bombed to bits & we ask why they seek another home.
9221 2018-08-01 01:24:09 Dawg, my grandma got cleared for medical  they gave her a pen with oil! “WE” about to but lifted
9222 2018-08-01 01:24:04 That shit be oil talk that shit be all your fault
9223 2018-08-01 01:23:34 I got some beard oil for the fellas.

9225 2018-08-01 01:23:30 My second clear political memory is the gulf oil spill, and those poor cormorants. I also remember more vaguely the beginning of the (first) gulf war.
9226 2018-08-01 01:23:20 @DrKeithRowley Thank you for the great support you offer to Venezuelans! You Trinitarians have lived on the great oil bounties of Venezuela and now that the people of Venezuela are going through the biggest crisis in their history they turn their backs on us, I really think that
9227 2018-08-01 01:23:00 This is AMAZING news! Congratulations!

I’ve considered it, but didn’t know anyone who only used the oil. Thank you for sharing, ladies!
9228 2018-08-01 01:22:58 Nothing is worse than spending 4+ hrs in a hair salon only for the hairdresser to fuck up and weigh ya shit down with too much damn oil sheen at the end
9229 2018-08-01 01:22:55 no matter how cautious i am with oil paints, it still manages to sneak itself on me somehow
9230 2018-08-01 01:22:53 Tea tree oil to!
9231 2018-08-01 01:22:41 1. The development of the Indonesian economy in the period 1982 - 1987 was marked with the weakening of world oil prices in 1982 and 1986 which resulted in the worsening of Indonesian economic performance.
9232 2018-08-01 01:22:30 I wish I had before and after pictures of how my dark spots/scars/stretch marks have been fading since I stopped using lotions and only coconut oil 
9233 2018-08-01 01:22:02 Pretty much what I posted! I had some broccoli so I put it in a baking pan with some olive oil, popped it into the oven with the frozen Amy's vegan margarita pizza, meanwhile cooking the frozen porkless bites in a pan.
9234 2018-08-01 01:21:55 Slipped into the Oil hole? No worries your owner Will be There Selling you for a new player to the club :)
9235 2018-08-01 01:21:53 It’s a “turn all the lights off in the house, drown my face in peppermint essential oil and ice packs, and hope to put out the fire in my head” kinda night.
9236 2018-08-01 01:21:52 Sizzzling like the oil on the pan lol
9237 2018-08-01 01:21:42 'Man finds oil; fucks son' would make for an entirely different film
9238 2018-08-01 01:21:21 no, I just sautéed an onion with olive oil, threw in some garlic and then used half for the taco meat and half for the riced cauliflower. I used salt, pepper, and cumin for the cauli rice.
9239 2018-08-01 01:21:16 スマホで仕上げたら早いんですが、それまでに治らないと…
9240 2018-08-01 01:21:05 Might be bad for oil countries, maybe. Oh well, they should get creative, innovate!
9241 2018-08-01 01:20:34 Not really, just my basic sauce for when I have extra tomatoes. It’s great on pasta, pizza, or add a bit more olive oil and dip good bread in it. Delish. Also freezes really well.
9242 2018-08-01 01:20:26 Trump is going to start drilling for oil off the coast of Stephen Miller.

9244 2018-08-01 01:20:12 Have to go get my oil changed at superstition Saturday, someone wanna drive up and we go to the mall till my car is done 
9245 2018-08-01 01:19:58 Mr. President..a quick anecdote.  25 plus years ago I knew a Deep Sea Welder.  Made repairs to oil rigs.  Brave welder, but still a welder.  Base salary? 75K!  OT? OMG!.  Average salary for a KY lawyer same time? 25K.
9246 2018-08-01 01:19:58 I think they actually did that, we just never saw the difference; because oil prices went up, after Iran oil embargo. Both things happened within 2 or 3 days.
9247 2018-08-01 01:19:51 I Just died with the oil popping vine 
9248 2018-08-01 01:19:45 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

9251 2018-08-01 01:19:29 Y’all wanna hear a funny story.... i wasted cooking oil ALL over my fucking face, stove, floor and counter tops bc it flipped over from the top cabinet, and the top popped off lol.
9252 2018-08-01 01:19:15 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?

9257 2018-08-01 01:18:29 This is why I plan to burry my crop and invest in oil!
9258 2018-08-01 01:18:27 Interesting point, but you may want to double check your fact finding. Your source is only looking at the Athabasca oil sands, whereas Lynne’s source (which is the gov. of Canada, she didn’t just make this up) looks at all the others as well.
9259 2018-08-01 01:18:19 Swihart starting to realize he needs to live up to the #23.. Oil Can, El Tiante, Brunanski, Calderon.. @adamjones985

9261 2018-08-01 01:18:01 I think they cooked em with  oil and garlic
9262 2018-08-01 01:17:44 I suppose you are right. The green sector has to start somewhere. I mean the oil industry wouldn't be profitable or as profitable without subsidy from us. So why not the green energy sector. Only problem is now we are subsidizing two energy sectors not one. And debt rising.
9263 2018-08-01 01:17:42 What was Redford's contingency plans for when the downturn happened? 

Remember she had to pay insane wages to keep these "professionals" Minister's and support staff from resuming careers in the oil patch.

9267 2018-08-01 01:16:45 Me: hm should I wash the kitchen floor tonight?

*April proceeds to knock over the essential oil diffuser and spill it all over the kitchen floor*

Decision made for me I guess #dogmomproblems
9268 2018-08-01 01:16:39 Make sure your natural doesn’t contain palm oil.  Palm oil planetarium destroying rain forest of SE Asia
9269 2018-08-01 01:16:38 I was asking my coworker how do you even change oil for a car. He was like “well first you don’t dump the oil in the car” like bitch I know I’m gay but shit I’m not stupid.
9270 2018-08-01 01:16:37 Does anyone know where I can get good quality CBD oil??
9271 2018-08-01 01:16:19 My essential oil diffuser comes in tomorrow and I’m just so excited

9278 2018-08-01 01:15:36 Scandinavian countries (I lived in one for a while) are also about 97% ethnically pure and their populations are very small.
Norway is about the size of CA and has fewer people than NJ. They also derive 40% of their GDP from drilling for oil in the North Sea.
9279 2018-08-01 01:15:33 The primary reason we don't have it in US is because providers, drug companies, insurance companies have immense power.Drug lobby spent 3.9 b in last 20 years ensuring health care is a commodity. That is the largest industry in terms of lobbying, period.More than oil, finance etc

9284 2018-08-01 01:14:46 Why would any Republican  want a Libertarian Koch endorsement
Koch shares most of the Ron Paul agenda.  Also - 
Koch's  father Fred Koch, made his first fortune building oil pipelines for the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin in the 1930s.
9285 2018-08-01 01:14:45 Oil and gas give tests to weed out the snowflakes.  I literally had to take a phone out of a snowflakes hand at a customers site.  They were paying us big bucks he was just out of college and couldn’t put the damn phone down. 

This is common sense but they weren’t taught that
9286 2018-08-01 01:14:02 i would kill for oily skin my dry skin is so awful and does not produce oil at all and its so hard for makeup to look good. I have to put a shit ton of moisturizer on AND oil just to make my foundation workable :(

9289 2018-08-01 01:13:23 Beard oil or beard balm?
9290 2018-08-01 01:13:22 Reminds me of when gas prices spiked during the '08 campaign. McCain inanely proposed to suspend the federal gas tax, which would've immediately led to gas prices rising to make up the difference, money straight into the pockets of oil cos.

(Low demand elasticity, and all that.)

9296 2018-08-01 01:11:55 Fellow arugula obsessive here. I like to smoke-then-sear a 2.5-3” thick ribeye or porterhouse, slice it onto a bed of arugula (so juices drip into the arugula), then add drizzled olive oil and shaved parm. Heaven.

9354 2018-08-01 01:01:52 Kratom has helped me so much. I have severe fibro, 4 herniated disks and possible RA. Dropped pain doctor and been pill free for 20 months. Good thing to because the doctor was already cutting patients off just got using hemp CBD oil which I was using too. The non THC stuff
9355 2018-08-01 01:01:48 I would pay money to see that.
9356 2018-08-01 01:01:43 Me too lol It's a great space to clear my head i look at colors, fabrics, memories of shopping with friends & Fred's truffle oil pizza always a fun way to end splurge after spending time with my awesome personal shopper saleshuman of at least 20 yrs she rocks so amazingly great

9366 2018-08-01 01:00:02 I somehow think it would be easier to reduce consumption of oil than to eliminate an entire form of agriculture from the entirety of human society.

9395 2018-08-01 00:55:02 But have u tried it with salt/vinegar & olive oil?
9396 2018-08-01 00:54:36 Okay you should be fine then. Be sure to watch the oil you want it hot but you need to monitor it to be sure you aren’t burning it
9397 2018-08-01 00:54:24 It’s organic hempseed oil. No THC. There are lots of options, though.
9398 2018-08-01 00:54:21 Yes call the police, “the squeaky wheel gets the oil”

9413 2018-08-01 00:52:17 It is being disposed. Oil in storage in the US went from about 500mb to just shy of 400mb now. Inventories at Cushing were close to 70mb and are now about 23.7m. (And some say that min. working inventory at Cushing is 18m). So we are close.

9488 2018-08-01 00:41:13 Absolutely every morning I make any bed I sleep in right away hotels, air B and B friends houses on the road no matter what I never have my things strewn around ! I travel with a launders hamper, tea tree oil to clean with I unpack my suitcases ASAP too  #OCD 
9489 2018-08-01 00:41:08 I just want somebody to massage my whole body in jojoba oil
9490 2018-08-01 00:40:59 We’ve got a few Norwegian friends, all frugal and serious-minded people. They were already a mature society when oil was found. Being socially conscious does not mean being an anti-capitalist idiot. Other nordic states have no oil yet are similar.

9492 2018-08-01 00:40:36 No - I'm saying the economic picture shifted - several years ago. Oil sands is one of the most expensive plays around to exploit - that has very little to do with regulation issues.

9497 2018-08-01 00:39:55 Are you advocating for tariffs ? Assuming WTO rules are eliminated, does that solve our current leadership issues? What will a country like Nigeria sell to the rest of the world (apart from crude oil)--asuming WTO rules are removed today?

9499 2018-08-01 00:39:26 Some type of blend. Not real heavy - like the old wool uniforms we had when I was a freshman. They were grey with green lettering & trim. Mine had an oil stain on it. Soph year, we went uptown with the green & golds. Lot of great memories - I have my #11 to this day.

9507 2018-08-01 00:37:37 That’s where the ducts that secrete oil to keep the eyes from drying up are, and mine were backed up hence all the gunk.  Use warm compresses in it every day
9508 2018-08-01 00:37:37 I see it didn’t take much to trigger you. The same industry who had a executive chairman of large oil sands company flee the province as soon as tax structure went up?

9513 2018-08-01 00:36:02 Since I planted so many marigolds I trim the dry flowers off all the time. The oil in the plants is so strong and it gets on my hands but I love the smell actually.

9517 2018-08-01 00:35:18 Oil pulling-
Oil pulling involves swishing oil around the mouth, using it like a mouthwash. It has been used for thousands of years as an Indian folk remedy. In order to oil pull, you put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth, then swish it around for 15–20 minutes.
9518 2018-08-01 00:35:16 Speeding to get a fucking oil change car sound bad 
9519 2018-08-01 00:35:14 They need to stop the stupid drug tests. I can’t get a few pills a year because I use CBD oil. Ridiculous! I used to use 2 pills a day now I maybe need 8-10 a year but nope

9535 2018-08-01 00:33:18 is this about my rosehip oil
9536 2018-08-01 00:32:55 I am waiting for the Democrats to favor and support the Koch brothers over Donald Trump. The democrats beat the Koch brothers up for many many years over oil. You know it’s going to happen, it’s the democratic way, the moronic hypocrites!!!
9537 2018-08-01 00:32:36 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
9538 2018-08-01 00:32:35 Who know how to change oil
9539 2018-08-01 00:32:17 Don’t be deceived by the jobs data. Wages are not growing because jobs created are not sustainable (shit jobs) and Labour force participation is stagnant. Higher oil price will push inflation higher and consumers will be squeezed out. Retails are already in crisis.
9540 2018-08-01 00:32:13 He's discussed them plenty, he just doesn't agree with you. He doesn't believe that imperialism or war are motivating wealthy oil heirs in the middle east to say they're blowing themselves up to kill Shia, U.S. soldiers, or girls schools and then do it.
9541 2018-08-01 00:32:10 Seriously, who here hasn't tried CBD oil yet?
9542 2018-08-01 00:31:28 That's a gross oversimplification of the picture. Government policy has relatively little to do with it. Alberta has little in new conventional reserves, and it's cheaper to exploit Permian shale plays than it is to develop oil sands extraction.
9543 2018-08-01 00:31:27 A4) Canola oil ! #canadaisfood
9544 2018-08-01 00:31:24 Yes, they were quite worried but everything is good now; and we've given them a bottle of wd oil to help the boys get friendly :)
9545 2018-08-01 00:31:14 Yeah it really is. 

If you don’t have an infuser or can’t do the hot water/towel steam method, drop eucalyptus oil on the shower head. 

It can help and just being able to smell can make a difference.

9559 2018-08-01 00:28:46 You are obviously ignorant of the history of oil. Ever since oil was discovered in Texas, there has been an boom and bust economy for oil. When oil consumption exceeded supply and was expensive (boom), more oil was found which resulted in supply exceeding demand (bust).

9563 2018-08-01 00:28:07 AIUI those at scale in Osaka are LNG, or Heavy Crude oil. The latter of these is in longterm shutdown. Maizuru is a supercitical plant in Kyoto. I have no stats on how it performs environmentally or commercially.

9592 2018-08-01 00:23:56 Yes, oil is traded on global markets, and the only way to be free of oil price fluctuations is to stop using it. It's the single most important foreign policy goal we should have. That's why we wrote Winning the Oil Endgame in 2004.

9598 2018-08-01 00:22:55 Rick, I don’t see a lot (none) tweets from you advocating to shut down the kern county oil fields in California. Because I know you’ve researched that area and know it’s dirtier than the oil sands right?
9599 2018-08-01 00:22:46 Not with prices going up.and they haven't gotten started yet wait till insurance prices go up by 20 percent and the oil embargoes on Iranian oil.gas prices maybe 3 plus dollars a gallon.the cost to moving products will drive living cost up.the disaster of trump

9604 2018-08-01 00:22:03 Technically I am bearish. On monthly chart, price bounced off 100MA in June. Fundamentally, I don’t think the global economy can handle a higher oil price. It will accelerate global economic slowdown which will hit demand. Trump is also desperate to bring price down.
9605 2018-08-01 00:22:01 LOL at #Greenpeace flying a propane powered blimp into Taft to protest oil drilling in California.  Dumbest shit I've seen all month, guess I don't have to feel bad at ignoring the people soliciting at whole foods if this is how they spend their money

9608 2018-08-01 00:21:32 Yes, the attempted coup & management-led oil strike & the Capitalist elite black market created the severe currency arbitrage that destroyed any chance for economic stability. It fostered an "every man for himself" mindset that is the antithesis of Socialism.

Now, Growth jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June. But No one will talk about this.

9629 2018-08-01 00:19:17 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for Jul 31st $40.47 US/bbl -$1.78 -4.21% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
9630 2018-08-01 00:19:15 Societies have embraced higher standards of living through cheap energy for 150 yrs. Science needed decades to understand its severity.
Now we need to change course.

Why should Big Oil pay, and not Big Coal, other oil companies, airlines, car makers or agriculture (methane!)?
9631 2018-08-01 00:19:13 So like proven in other parts of world pricing carbon does reduce pollution- only by chasing away business elsewhere where it is cheaper. End result no reduction in pollution. Just pushes it elsewhere. And Alberta has some of cleanest oil production in the world even before ndp
9632 2018-08-01 00:19:11 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
9633 2018-08-01 00:19:08 I wish I had the conscience to sell snake oil to this lot.  $$
9634 2018-08-01 00:19:06 Yeah! Those weird oil commercials that claim they are helping the environment, buy draining its resources. Literally commercials for this shit. Proof we failed as Americans.
9635 2018-08-01 00:18:44 I like the cartridges of oil as well.
9636 2018-08-01 00:18:31 Looking to catch up with other folks in Oil and Gas or energy at #BHUSA or @defcon. Hit me up if you want to catch up.
9637 2018-08-01 00:18:27 Rather than putting coconut oil in my hair frequently… I do it a week before my hair appointment and get disappointed bc my ends are still dead
9638 2018-08-01 00:18:23 Man, if I could make as much money writing the bull$hit I just read in this article as I do generating title notes on my reports for oil and gas companies...I would switch careers immediately. I wouldn't even have to do research!!!!
9639 2018-08-01 00:18:01 Whipped my own shea butter today. Put in extra virgin olive oil, sweet almond oil and argan oil. Next time I’m adding in fragrance / perfume
9640 2018-08-01 00:17:59 @jerseymikes I love your subs, I order it once a week. Today I was sadly disappointed, I couldn’t believe that it was possible to skimp on red wine vinegar, oil blend, spices and salt and pepper. But somehow it happened #notmikesway
9641 2018-08-01 00:17:49 Right?! She was just getting an oil change too but they reported almost $1,000 of extra work. I'm glad they inspect the car but it's ridiculous. $100 for a serpentine belt 
9642 2018-08-01 00:17:42 I also think oil will eventually go higher... The question is just how long it takes.
9643 2018-08-01 00:17:18 ただのサラリーマンからプータローへw ありがとうございます！
9644 2018-08-01 00:17:10 I dedicate one night per week to zhush (loosely translated as primping).

Mani/pedi 
Oatmeal mask 

Next: total body sugar scrub followed by coco butter application

9647 2018-08-01 00:16:42 USA and healthcare.  Like oil and water.  Don’t get it.
9648 2018-08-01 00:16:33 Did I invent popcorn with balsamic vinegar and olive oil ?
9649 2018-08-01 00:16:31 Just so you are aware the current save the world ndp are advocating to build a pipeline to ship more oil everywhere. They also thinking of approving new coal mines for export overseas. While business leaves here we feed it with Alberta mined fossil fuels. 1/2
9650 2018-08-01 00:15:54 Have fun! But avoid the street food, some of the food is cooked with gutter oil. Not a goof, go check it out on YouTube
9651 2018-08-01 00:15:46 Check your Engine oil this weekend.

9654 2018-08-01 00:15:07 garnier toner yung kulay blue tapos sabayan mo ng celeteque na hydration promise makokontrol niya yung oily skin. tip: pag oily skin dapat mas moiturize yung balat to control oil production. just saying sana nakatulong.
9655 2018-08-01 00:14:59 My son has resolutely refused both shaving & haircuts for some considerable months - he’s not looking cishet at all, which I think was his entire purpose.

We’re discussing beard oil for some level of visible grooming.
9656 2018-08-01 00:14:55 #250YearsAgo, 8/1/1768, Boston based merchants and traders create the Boston Non-Importation Agreement. As a way to boycott the Townshend Revenue Act of 1767, this agreement was to stop the importing of certain taxable goods, such as glass, lead, oil, paint, paper, and tea.
9657 2018-08-01 00:14:44 How much would you charge to do a painting of me hanging out with  @realDonaldTrump @realGollumTrump @jesus @TheTweetOfGod and @rickygervais ? Oil, of course, the greasier the better.
9658 2018-08-01 00:14:34 I dont confide in ppl that dont care about the planet such as pollution, waste, oil spills, etc. deadass how can these be trustworthy people?
9659 2018-08-01 00:14:23 Nothing slick to a can of oil ...
9660 2018-08-01 00:14:13 I'm usually better off sticking with oil too.
9661 2018-08-01 00:13:50 Yailah jangankan ginian, lips akoeh aja masih virgin kek olive oil.
9662 2018-08-01 00:13:36 nigga the 22r shits on the cobra lol im sure if we run both with no oil the cobra would blow up and shit lmao
9663 2018-08-01 00:13:26 oil changes are relaxing
9664 2018-08-01 00:13:24 Are YOU prepared for the inevitable apocalypse that will follow then the libs decide that coal and oil are "#cancelled"
9665 2018-08-01 00:13:21 Then be ready to be out of work when they flood the market with oil
9666 2018-08-01 00:13:19 API Stocks　announced 7/31（as of 7/27）　unit : mln bbl　　changement : pre-week / pre-year

9670 2018-08-01 00:12:47 So I walked into the bathroom to see my sister putting castor oil??? On her eyelashes???
9671 2018-08-01 00:12:47 Not right, true - but 100% predictable considering how this tax cut was structured. Totally unfunded, btw - so they're cashing out $$ our kids will have to repay to the Chinese and the oil sheikhs.
9672 2018-08-01 00:12:46 Umm... are we (OU) using the trophy as a door stop now? 

Next I’ll find out the physical plant guys are using the Potato Bowl trophy for oil changes.
9673 2018-08-01 00:12:45 Big Oil expects to have control of alternatives and innovations.
9674 2018-08-01 00:12:43 We get along well. Me & my father are like oil & water.
9675 2018-08-01 00:12:27 you could still generate the co2 you'd need... there was life there, so there is oil there... just burn the oil to create it
9676 2018-08-01 00:11:18 Got organic coconut oil from Aldi and it actually smells like coconut. I’ve never had coconut oil that legitimately smelled like coconut. I’m so happy.
9677 2018-08-01 00:11:03 ENERGY SECURITY?
You are both already thieving oil & gas reserves from both the Palestinains & Syrias Golon Heights ILLEGALLY.
What more can you #Zionist criminals do?
9678 2018-08-01 00:10:46 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9679 2018-08-01 00:10:37 the cooking oil will protect you from the sun?

9684 2018-08-01 00:10:08 Jimmy Carter is, in my opinion, the most underrated American President. Had the most overrated President not overturned his policies, this country might already have shrugged its dependency on foreign oil. #HeadsOutOfAsses
9685 2018-08-01 00:09:55 Let God apply the pressure so that you can have the oil! We must be oily and on assignment! #ThIsNew
9686 2018-08-01 00:09:46 You’re welcome Canada from our Oil & Gas industry again! @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @jjhorgan
9687 2018-08-01 00:09:42 CDB Oil. Hemp oil cures. Keep feeling great
9688 2018-08-01 00:09:40 Use raw shea butter and bio oil!
9689 2018-08-01 00:09:40 What is @Toyota doing for people whose cars have an oil consumption problem?
9690 2018-08-01 00:09:24 I see you how you think that, what with the #Idiot...but it's really more of a pointing out of fact, like you might say "that guy had to duck going though the door, he sure is #Tall."  No emotion behind it...

And then the other comment was just free advice, like check your oil.
9691 2018-08-01 00:09:17 It is crazy!! Went in for an oil change and walked out with a lot more than just that done lol
9692 2018-08-01 00:09:16 what!? You got some cheap oil?
9693 2018-08-01 00:09:11 And hemp could replace a lot of plastic products. Chemical & oil companies would lose money
9694 2018-08-01 00:09:09 I graduated college we had an oil shortage, we were told to not have Xmas lights to save energy. They said we were out of water, land and that we needed price controls. Prime interest rates were 21% car loans were 25% plus. Times have changed yet we complain for more?
9695 2018-08-01 00:09:05 @CPG_Corp CPG share price is totally unacceptable.  It's the WORST investment in my portfolio.  The Board of Directors and Management should IMMEDIATELY  do something about it or RESIGN.  Oil prices are going up and your share price sucks.
9696 2018-08-01 00:09:00 For me it was always a Banana Milkshake and Double Cheeseburger.

Many fond memories of stops at Peter’s in Calgary after Oil King /Centennial games in the old Stampede Corral. 

Always stopped on our way home to Olds! (sigh) 
9697 2018-08-01 00:08:29 UK could negotiate a tarrif free FTA with EU no problem. It would still mean checks, delays, paperwork and the destruction of thousands of exporters and supply chains. Snake oil salesmen who don't have a scooby.
9698 2018-08-01 00:08:13 Has anybody tried using motor oil as a sexual lubricant?
9699 2018-08-01 00:08:08 I had breast cancer. Used it for the pain, so I didn't get exposed to pain meds. Use it now to sleep & CBD oil for prevention. Israel uses in it hospitals. Natural our bodies have an cannabinoid system. #MAGA

9708 2018-08-01 00:05:28 The background checks for buying olive oil are ridiculous.

9710 2018-08-01 00:05:22 It's #NationalAvacadoDay! Did you know our Daily Dose #CBDoil is infused with avocado oil? This oil is heart healthy, anti-inflammatory, & soothes the body from head-to-toe. Also infused: sunflower lechithin, grapeseed, bergamot, and grapefruit essential oils for maximum relief
9711 2018-08-01 00:04:58 All new and flash. Not our cup of motor oil.

9714 2018-08-01 00:04:41 The bourgeois clap-trap about the family, and for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
9715 2018-08-01 00:04:36 Who do you think will pay? We the people not the oil companies.
9716 2018-08-01 00:04:24 So, which is it, you vacuuous physical moron - the NDP is ruining oil and gas, or we're successful right now BECAUSE of oil and gas?

Seriously, talking out of both sides of your mouth must be tiring. I know I'm tired of hearing it.
9717 2018-08-01 00:04:24 そうそう！その中で優秀なのはヘラクレスで、タマモキャットもバーサーカーで序盤使えると思うよ！でもわたしはエリちゃんでも充分な気がする！宝具重ねられるのは美味しい！

9720 2018-08-01 00:04:02 Oil subsidies 4.6 Billion a year. The U.S. federal government spends $100 billion a year on corporate welfare. That's an average of $870 for each one of America's 115 million families.

9727 2018-08-01 00:02:47 MOUNT OUSLEY: All southbound lanes have reopened on the M1 Princes Mwy after an earlier oil spill near Mount Ousley Rd.
9728 2018-08-01 00:02:18 Or, employers could pay more. Plenty of Americans flocked to dirty oil field jobs. 

As a bonus, when you pay an a American worker more, you’re not importing someone who imposes additional costs on the country.
