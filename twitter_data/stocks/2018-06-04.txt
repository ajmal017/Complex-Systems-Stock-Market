1 2018-06-04 23:58:03 See and I felt just the opposite. That you were deflecting from the investigation by pointing out how good Barack's economy was that he left you with. Stocks were already climbing. Unemployment was already dropping. Workers had protection. Environment had protection. WTF

4 2018-06-04 23:55:36 Btw, recent losses have NOT nulled any gains of the first year. Maybe you have crap stocks.  Lowest unemployment for women since the 50s, lowest for blacks and Hispanics EVER. Unemployment 3.8%. Unbelievable.
5 2018-06-04 23:53:25 And then @MBMBaM talks for like twenty minutes about Apple presentations and Apple stocks... in a podcast recorded days before WWDC2018 where Apple kinda won’t shut up about the iOS Stocks app as though anyone cares at all.

30 2018-06-04 23:43:53 My charts indicate U.S. is in the later stages of an economic cycle. That would suggest stocks are due for a pullback, and makes me like $BTC and crypto even more.

33 2018-06-04 23:41:48 If Howard Schultz runs for President in 2020, Starbucks stocks shall plummet as the company will surely face the largest and most organized boycott in US consumer history led by the entire GOP party and Republican electorate.
34 2018-06-04 23:41:01 Oh hell yeah breaking news stories to the stocks app??
35 2018-06-04 23:40:28 Iam a proud bagholder of  $tsro from mid 40’s, holding and will add if needed to be, had done good with going into something very negative sentiment before in multiple other stocks in the past. Where others see going to 0-teens, i feel it will recover at some point just my 2cents

37 2018-06-04 23:39:52 I still reckon the kids would enjoy having an old set of stocks set up where they (we) could throw rotten tomatoes at the politicians.
38 2018-06-04 23:36:44 $AVP looking like a buy now or around 1.50
39 2018-06-04 23:36:05 take @dchauff advice as good as buying blue chip stocks
40 2018-06-04 23:35:13 No. They showed vaporware that is only available to first party apps. Like the stocks coming everywhere!  Maybe next year developers can be trusted with such code.
41 2018-06-04 23:35:12 Seems like oil stocks didn’t follow the rally..
42 2018-06-04 23:34:38 If it doesn’t have tactical advantages, then why don’t all military, SWAT, etc carry plain wooden stocks? FYI, guns rights guy here, just think the “it’s not an assault weapon” thing is nonfactual and borderline idiotic.
43 2018-06-04 23:34:25 I have always felt this type of chart is misleading, since @americanfunds is basically comparing apples to oranges. First, the funds typically have international holdings. Second, many of the holdings of these funds are mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which can enhance return.
44 2018-06-04 23:33:42 SUPER interesting to see what others do with their money - particularly those on team #FIRE !  I see myself as diversified by owning thousands of different stocks via index funds...I've been an investor through 2 market swoons (tech, financial) and done well, which helps. 
45 2018-06-04 23:33:17 I recently bought $CVS. I like the Aetna $AET merger and the synergy that can come from it. Leaving room for more shares if it continues to fall. #health #stocks.

49 2018-06-04 23:28:25 Look Bump stocks machine guns what ever will not stop murders. They can use bombs or bow and arrow. I perfer to have guns available then not. You ever had an illegal trying break into your house I did. And at time I had no ammo. That never happened again. I live in Canada now
50 2018-06-04 23:27:20 finder is fine for most use cases today. window management I agree could use a revamp, but it's easily fixed with simple tools so... whatever.

61 2018-06-04 23:23:34 Someone would have classdumped News, Stocks, etc and figured out they were using UIKit 5 minutes after Mojave was released. Apple might as well take control of the narrative.
62 2018-06-04 23:23:27 The Stock Market is climbing fast, I can't really tell which stocks are bad stocks anymore. I fear that there may be a huge selloff & market crash but I'm not sure of the cause. A Trade War may hurt US revenue or a War may or businesses being corrupt & losing billions of $ may.
63 2018-06-04 23:22:58 Bump stocks are not for sportsmen or for sport. They're purely for killing as many human beings as possible in the least amount of time.
64 2018-06-04 23:22:35 Banning bump stocks would not have prevented these shootings. Not a one of them. Banning AR15's would not have prevented these shootings. But tell me again what law would have ? None because criminals don't follow laws.

72 2018-06-04 23:15:35 I have a feeling Ezra is not interested in maximizing output, just his own stocks of ice cream.
73 2018-06-04 23:14:24 I think Huerter's soph season is within ballpark of Klay/Korver but clearly worse. Less 3PT volume, worse FT shooting, way worse stocks than both. Korver shooting clearly on another level, Klay's USG a big differentiator. I think being that good is basically his 99th percentile.
74 2018-06-04 23:13:41 GIC pays out at the end of a term. Dividend stocks pay you monthly or quarterly. Cash flow is king! Plus, if you DRIP the dividends for a few years, the total payout grows even more.
75 2018-06-04 23:13:27 ledge hogging is fine in melee because it's 4 stocks, but in a 2 stock game or even 3 stock sm4sh big NO
76 2018-06-04 23:13:03 $tsro not saying BO happening but it cud.stocks r generally not bought at their highs. They're bought when stock price weak & mgmt stumbling. TSRO has decent pipeline & rev growing nicely. They're definitely vulnerable to a BO & prob would do better under stronger mgmt team
77 2018-06-04 23:12:56 doesn't change that ledge hogging is lame as hell, a lazy way to take stocks, and tends to cripple already bad characters.

80 2018-06-04 23:12:08 JUST MAY HAVE TO SELL A COUPLE SLOW POKE STOCKS NOT RUNNING HOW I WOULDVE HOPED BEFORE THIS FRIDAY AND POUR IT INTO $TGOD ...
81 2018-06-04 23:11:38 Basically since WW2, gold mining stocks loosely followed the business/credit cycle. Until now. Some gold majors are at 2001 lows. Some undress are at 1997 lows. So whatever this gold price is, it's not enough to keep the miners in business.
82 2018-06-04 23:11:38 Bump stocks probably..  21 never going to get passed the Constitution.
83 2018-06-04 23:11:33 Yes, I get the "narrow ruling." So if a gun dealer advertises "customized stocks" and a gay person requests a rainbow, a pious merchant can say no? And who would agree to let the baker determine if a cake design is "suitable?" Again, not arguing, wondering if a gun beats a cake.

They go into Ball with a 3-1 Hbox lead.

106 2018-06-04 22:55:45 I see that 2018 is a different trend & that stocks have stepped down from 2015 highs. Absence of price or some other calibration makes it hard to interpret but it's definitely interesting.
107 2018-06-04 22:55:01 Volatility is opportunity, but also lost opportunity. Expect a lot more given the ending stocks sensitivity in corn. Bulls will get scared, bears will get scared, alike.

139 2018-06-04 22:37:20 I don't know, but you don't have to own them. Can just own stocks that are in uptrends.

141 2018-06-04 22:36:11 The stocks example is an easy one to beat up, especially when you consider all of the things they could possibly talk about in a keynote:

It doesn’t have a far-reaching, conspiracy-laced logical conclusion about the long-term actions of Apple.

143 2018-06-04 22:35:23 They are foreclosures meaning bank repossessed the properties. Meaning he didn't buy homes out from under anybody. By the way check went up $450.00 more A month. And gas went up only 38cents here and I dont buy stocks so doeant bother me.
144 2018-06-04 22:35:04 Well, “ a number of” could include ONE, @JRubinBlogger!

151 2018-06-04 22:28:03 Warren Buffet timeframe is usually much longer than anyone else. Time is his friend. Plus, he doesn't do much margin. He plays stocks an derivatives with cash, lot of it.
152 2018-06-04 22:27:50 Also it does tie into Mahave because thats the tech they used to bring home news and stocks to the mac so it is somewhat relavent
153 2018-06-04 22:26:54 1: They're updating the stocks app on iPhone. It will now be more like the SigFig iPad app.

2: They're FINALLY bringing the stocks app to the iPad.

3: There are rumors they will buy back tons of Apple stocks but as far as I know that's not 100% confirmed. Just have to wait&see

156 2018-06-04 22:25:33 Whatever happens this week with pot stocks will be big one way or another... either they keep rolling or the market sells the news. Personally I could be wrong but I believe smart money will sell the news and reload on the dip. Again, I could be entirely wrong. #PotStocks

162 2018-06-04 22:21:03 The NASDAQ high March 13 was 7637.27 I guess you’re talking about the closing high not actual high… Still major resistance at 2767 S&P long ways from the high! S&P not close to the March high which was 2801. 90… Indices do not reflect market as many stocks are underwater!

$BDR I didn't chase and got in early enough as it broke 52W high with intentions of holding O/N. What did I do wrong to deserve this kinda blow. This thing puts u off from touching penny stocks. NO opportunity to cut losses, as it dumped 30c. NO prior warning.

167 2018-06-04 22:17:20 Stop investing in people and invest in stocks
168 2018-06-04 22:17:20 She was simply stating the fact that banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase fire arms would not violate the second amendment whatsoever, meaning that if Trump thought doing that would violate our rights, then he clearly doesn’t understand the second amendment.
169 2018-06-04 22:17:19 Dow closes up over 100 points, NASDAQ closes at new all-time high, Twitter being adopted by S&P 500 and the stock rips over $2, $AMD showing strength above $14 level, $BABA rips and oil trading lower. Love this current market. #Stocks
170 2018-06-04 22:15:22 14 #stocks set all-time highs in finance sector yesterday.
171 2018-06-04 22:13:39 Doesn’t your second amendment SPECIFICALLY say ‘well regulated’? And where SPECIFICALLY does it mention AR-15s and bump stocks? Why do you consider them a ‘right’?
172 2018-06-04 22:13:29 Exactly! People act like gun control would completely violate the second amendment, as if we’re asking for ALL guns to be banned! We’re not! We only want assault/semi automatic weapons and bump stocks banned. People will still be able to own hunting rifles and pistols!
173 2018-06-04 22:12:54 People give me shit about crypto, but in the age of Trump, why would anyone invest in stocks?
174 2018-06-04 22:12:50 He plays Mick in EastEnders, so can't complain! The shop stocks loads of stuff taking the piss out of Trump,... Party games for the far right-minded, etc. But also jellycat soft toys! I love it, always have done. It's been a feature of Reading for as long as I can remember.
175 2018-06-04 22:11:56 Don’t get me wrong I’d do a little victory dance if we got 6-7p. But languishing at sub 1p with a 2.05p average isn’t the best position hence the doom and gloom!! #ast
176 2018-06-04 22:11:44 This morning I noticed many young adults tweeting the following statement. I also noticed they are being attacked and that just pisses me off!
"Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?"
177 2018-06-04 22:11:37 Also, in addition to that, I want to know if your store in Sevireville stocks cellular boosters, because I need one.
178 2018-06-04 22:10:52 You mean lower taxes, border protection, peace with North Korea, Isis being dismantled, stocks going up, lowest unemployment.  What part of all that needs to go.
179 2018-06-04 22:08:49 Dear Apple, if you have to tell me something is cool, it is not cool.  Also bringing something to the iPad that should have been there years ago (stocks & news) is sad not cool.
180 2018-06-04 22:08:45 i suggest you take your own advice and “stop spamming $LG.V (and other stocks) with irrelevant tweets”
181 2018-06-04 22:07:09 Plus the oil don’t forget which colin rarely mentions for some reason
182 2018-06-04 22:07:03 If you ever invested in stocks, crypto should make you more excited than anything ever has.  

If your new to trading anything, take your time,  learn, and don’t let the OG’s dump on you ; )
183 2018-06-04 22:06:15 I’m trying to learn how to buy stocks. Someone teach me.
184 2018-06-04 22:06:06 Para nada. Que aplaudieran a la nueva App de “stocks” me deprimió un poco. Muy magro.
185 2018-06-04 22:05:27 A start? There are plenty of current gun laws in place now, and they aren't doing much to stop shootings. Banning bump stocks is laughable when you look at how little they're actually used. Truth is most shootings occur with handguns in America, that is where the start should be.
186 2018-06-04 22:04:55 They will be voting to spare fear of death in schools i.e. (by machine guns ak47s 38s 48s exploding bullets bumb stocks easy accessibility of weapontry to kill human beings) of school age children of any frickin age!
187 2018-06-04 22:03:21 Not bump stocks but AR15s are firearms. So yes.
188 2018-06-04 22:03:18 If anyone plans on signing up for Robinhood let me know so I can link you and we get free stocks

194 2018-06-04 22:01:31 on the other hand, I'm not sure I approve of waterboarding even for dishonest Economist writers. Perhaps a day in the stocks would be more appropriate?

But for the sake of argument, tell me one crime he has committed (evidence required, not a hunch or what CNN told you).

And define "destroying."  Record unemployment, stocks, low taxes?  Peace w/   NK?

207 2018-06-04 21:57:18 So your life became worse since Trump lowered your taxes giving you more money, eliminated regulations stifling businesses, created 3 million jobs for women, Hispanics&African Americans, stocks skyrocketing improving your 401k etc..It takes a liberal to view this as being "worse"
208 2018-06-04 21:56:35 News app is ok, I’d prefer Google News, but can’t picture making that into a wrapper app.

215 2018-06-04 21:54:02 No it is not. First of all you can't intermingle Cryptocurrency with Stocks on a Stock Exchange. Secondly, NASDAQ mentioned they would CONSIDER starting a cryptocurrency exchange some time in the future.

216 2018-06-04 21:53:39 Bump-stocks are a redundant apparatus, that makes a high capacity rifle even faster. The point for the apparatus is used to KILL at an increasing speed.

235 2018-06-04 21:45:13 Microsoft: We have acquired GitHub, we will empower developers.
Apple: We redesigned the Stocks app!
236 2018-06-04 21:44:03 Apple Exec: “you know what apple users need? Tongue Detection. Oh, and better add stock news, because so many people use our stocks app....”
237 2018-06-04 21:43:43 I think the point is that bump stocks make it easy to kill a lot of people quickly.  It’s one small piece of the fix.
238 2018-06-04 21:42:38 The stocks have also been down since February. They’re down almost 2000 points since Jan 26. This was also the worst yearly start EVER for the DOW. They’ve been pretty stagnant.
239 2018-06-04 21:42:36 Bump stocks make it possible for shooters to mow down huge numbers of people in seconds, making it very hard for first responders to get to the attacker and stop the carnage.  Pretty simple logic. There could be fewer mass murders.
240 2018-06-04 21:41:36 Please expend more time and energy on bump stocks. They’re a joke! Nobody uses them. Did you know that you can bump fire any semi auto rifle with a shoelace or a rubber band? It’s simple. Lots of YouTube videos on it. Your thumb will work too. I know no one that uses them.
241 2018-06-04 21:41:04 “Fetch forth the stocks!”
242 2018-06-04 21:41:02 @alocke4454 good stocks are easier longs on dips than shorts.
243 2018-06-04 21:40:49 So Trump can do that?  I am pretty sure he said he is OK with a ban on bump stocks.  Get your representative to put it forward.  I bet Trump will sign it.
244 2018-06-04 21:40:23 Stocks for Mac was developer-centric, no? What all developers don’t work for Apple/Google/Facebook??!
245 2018-06-04 21:39:54 And precision peak detectors. Thankfully, Farnell had some selling at under £3 each until stocks are exhausted. The downside is they're SMD and <3mm in size :-/
246 2018-06-04 21:38:52 No, President Trump has made us, and himself, laughing stocks on the world stage.
247 2018-06-04 21:38:18 I stopped watching "Wolf Of Wallstreet" when I found out it wasn't about an adorable fluffy wolfie wearing a lil' suit and trying to trade awoo stocks in Wallstreet... Talk about false advertising....
248 2018-06-04 21:36:14 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

264 2018-06-04 21:30:22 Interesting. Uncertainty always points towards Treasuries in my book and that’s what I expected to read here. I wouldn’t expect Treasuries and growth stocks to rally together.
265 2018-06-04 21:29:57 @kroyrunner89 hi there, would you say all listed stocks setups mentioned in trading tickers are still useful today?
266 2018-06-04 21:29:43 Congratulations! And again, many thanks for your expertise and all those hours spend updating us on these stocks. Continue to learn and make some $$ along the way. Your the best!

268 2018-06-04 21:29:10 Matt president Trump didn't need to ban bump stocks the company that made them stopped production of them
269 2018-06-04 21:28:42 Ban bump stocks.
270 2018-06-04 21:28:39 oh right there's a stocks app lmao

275 2018-06-04 21:27:23 What he didn't have was anything that could end Pusha's so he tapped out by third party. Yuuuuck!
Back to resource stocks.
276 2018-06-04 21:27:20 And then John, you have Uranium One. $500K paid to Bill Clinton for a 90 minute speech and then $145 Million to the Clinton foundation and then, voila, 20% of US Uranium stocks in Russian hands. Nothing to see there at all.
277 2018-06-04 21:26:57 I’m not seeing your point. Are you meaning to say that we shouldn’t ban bump stocks simply because of a hypothetical situation that you cannot back up & anecdotal evidence about your pig-shooting friend? 
278 2018-06-04 21:26:39 Tech stocks are worth a lot. At $3.8 trillion, the combined value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet tops the annual gross domestic product of Germany.

279 2018-06-04 21:26:36 I saw today where you did out standing with your trades . My question is you have BABA and say goggle with someone like myself only starting out with say five grand . How does one even get in on them or do I just stay with low stocks .
280 2018-06-04 21:26:22 Is this a joke? I would invest all that money into future stocks or bonds lmao. Clothes that are cheap have nice value.
281 2018-06-04 21:26:18 credit score went up a couple points, stocks rising .. yes 
282 2018-06-04 21:25:52 I don't understand that stuff what's good app to use RT @RealistBullsFan: @NewYorkZ_FinesT stocks are boring, crypto is where it's at
283 2018-06-04 21:25:08 Nope!!!They are talking about all the People you let die in Puerto Rico!!! Also talking about what kind of awful human being would rip children out of their Mother’s arms?!! Oh, that would be you! How about those bump stocks that you were going to ban?! Tariffs against allies?!
284 2018-06-04 21:24:54 Chaos? Sorry that he helped guide Korea to a peace treaty, stocks soared when he became president. Tell me where the chaos is?
285 2018-06-04 21:24:33 They were good enough to bring stocks to desktop. That is impact.
286 2018-06-04 21:24:06 They’re putting The Penguin as the main villain for the Batman???????? @wbpictures well that’s one way to lose money and see a decline in your stocks.
287 2018-06-04 21:23:52 Que gran noticia que #Apple porte la app de Stocks al iPad.

Muy necesaria.

#NO
288 2018-06-04 21:23:36 Does the new stocks app make the stocks you want go up?
289 2018-06-04 21:21:48 Has anyone ever hear of penny pot stocks?
290 2018-06-04 21:21:38 News, Stocks and Apple Books are pretty sweet on the iPad with the iOS 12 beta! #wwdc #iosdev
291 2018-06-04 21:21:33 The point of my post was to target bigger stocks lowering risk and lowering discipline level needed .
292 2018-06-04 21:21:32 stocksの送金手数料10 NCPになってるとかどうなってんだよ・・・ムカついたから大量で試してやった
293 2018-06-04 21:20:59 That are great News. And both are amazing Trader-Stocks.
294 2018-06-04 21:20:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
295 2018-06-04 21:20:42 I thought "titoli" means stocks...Bonds it is then.
296 2018-06-04 21:20:38 yeah, tons of gaps below... and not just on $spx, but on lots of stocks, as well...
297 2018-06-04 21:20:30 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
298 2018-06-04 21:20:14 Market Close: MBS -22bps; DOW +178.48; NASDAQ +52.13; S&P 500 +12.25; 10yr Treasury 2.94%; Light news day, as stocks continued upward trend from Friday's Jobs Numbers.  MBS slid further down (Beneath it's 50 DMA); Yields climbed (breaking above it's 50 DMA).
299 2018-06-04 21:19:33 Bump stocks are a joke. Please expend a lot of energy trying to ban them. This is great! 
BTW did you know you can easily bump fire any semi auto rifle with a shoelace or a rubber band-even your thumb! Google it. Lots of YouTube videos.
300 2018-06-04 21:19:22 Did you get any info on how news articles will get into the stocks app?
301 2018-06-04 21:19:16 FUDGE - on sale now... all Fudge hair products 30% off (while stocks last)
302 2018-06-04 21:18:54 Hey, I was looking at the same stocks except I did not find AQARF. Which software do you use to find your OTC breakout stocks? Thanks
303 2018-06-04 21:18:28 YOU OBAMMY OWN STOCKS IN AMMUNITION AND GUNS.
BOUGHT MILLIONS OF ROUNDS OF AMMO TO BOUST YOUR PROFITS TO HECK YOU SAY???? TAQIYYA
304 2018-06-04 21:18:10 Some of the things were underwhelming and it feels like they were pushing Stocks for some reason but on the whole a very interesting #WWDC18
305 2018-06-04 21:17:35 I listed a bunch of things,tell me what ones you're resisting And explain why you didn't mind O deporting 2.7 million illegals, he allowed the sale of bump stocks He locked kids up in cages like dogs and not a peep from you libs, he killed 1000s of civilians with drone attacks
306 2018-06-04 21:17:17 ...just Putin this out there ... bump stocks !
307 2018-06-04 21:17:11 Best way to learn about stocks? Can you point me in the tonight direction?
308 2018-06-04 21:17:05 Any chance you discovered any additional back stocks of the MOD-t just lying around :D
309 2018-06-04 21:16:35 and the stocks went up 2.1% I’m told.
310 2018-06-04 21:16:26 Because he bought $TSLA stocks when it was $100 and he is enjoying 3x return on his investment unlike you who is losing money left and right on you short position
311 2018-06-04 21:16:11 "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions" @NRA
312 2018-06-04 21:16:05 Right, but then have the nerve to sit there and ask why corporations buy back stocks and fire people or why more schools get shot up.
313 2018-06-04 21:16:00 Pot stocks, man. When July rolls around those should start to skyrocket, the reason being is pot will become legal all across Canada and the USA will be their biggest supplier. So invest in cannabis, hemp and marijuana stocks.
314 2018-06-04 21:15:31 So now I can facetime 31 other people, whilst looking like a Koala, to tell them I think having the stocks app and some dark software accenting on my £3000 Mac isn't that big a deal.

316 2018-06-04 21:14:27 @NickRossTech was placed in the stocks for calling this sabotage early. How dare he?!...said Truffles, who then proceeded to pull the rug; in true underhand sneaky Truffles manner.
317 2018-06-04 21:14:05 Okay so here are my impressions about tonight:
-AR2 is so lit and a game changer imagine all the box games coming with AR2
-They could’ve done better with Siri but a great start tbh better than nothing and a feature been waiting since what 2014? 
-News And Stocks apps so good
318 2018-06-04 21:12:59 Why trust you when you can’t keep a promise. Ban bump stocks and raise the age to buy a firearm to 21 like you promised!
319 2018-06-04 21:12:32 Pero cuéntanos lo importante... cómo va stocks?
320 2018-06-04 21:12:25 I can’t believe people actually care about the stocks app for Apple to update the app and bring it to iPad and Mac #WWDC18
321 2018-06-04 21:12:09 ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? @realDonaldTrump
Is afraid of the @NRA?”
322 2018-06-04 21:12:00 Hey Twitter fam what classifies a person as a troll??? Are they a fan that jumps into your stream? Or a person that stocks your accounts??? Or stream chases you? Please enlighten me!
323 2018-06-04 21:11:45 Apple's WWDC in review: 
- A bunch of small features that could be shipped individually but instead rolled into one giant release (iOS 12)
- macOS software got a little love, but they keep pretending like the hardware isn't terrible
- the stocks app got mentioned 9999 times
324 2018-06-04 21:10:04 Strange how disliked and ridiculed the Stocks app seems to be among many developers. I for one like tracking how my investments are doing. Wish it had its main focus on months and years instead of minutes and hours, though.
325 2018-06-04 21:09:56 I'll put her in the village stocks tomorrow and everyone can throw rotten fruit at her. Then I'm coming for little Miss D.
326 2018-06-04 21:09:21 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to buy a gun to 21?
327 2018-06-04 21:08:57 banning bump stocks wont heal your soul, they were used 1 time to injure all those people. truth be told, they are gimmick. That said, i hope you know you can bump fire a gun WITHOUT a bump stock with about 5 minutes of practice. banning bump stocks is an illusion
328 2018-06-04 21:08:26 Ban bump stocks and raise the to buy a gun to 21
329 2018-06-04 21:07:58 nice :o did you used stocks?
330 2018-06-04 21:07:41 Absolutely intolerable ... The Town "Wolf" Cryers ... Prepare the "court yard punishment stocks"... Not a one of them have the personal integrity to realize any embarrassment
331 2018-06-04 21:07:33 My two favorite niche memes of the day: 
1. Nobody knowing where tf Melania is
2. Nintendo being "doomed" for the 100th time this decade because their stocks changed a little bit
332 2018-06-04 21:07:25 C’mon IQ is nothing like those years. Those stocks were frequently up 60-100% on IPO day.  Remember eBay?  Ipo’d at like $16 and was $30 on the open?
333 2018-06-04 21:07:10 of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law," the NRA wrote in a statement. "The NRA believes that devices
334 2018-06-04 21:06:56 If you look at the RSI of tech stocks, most are in the overbought region. We’ve had a really nice rally and wouldn’t be surprised if we see a industry wide correction.
335 2018-06-04 21:06:49 I’m not saying anything about code names, just that Sam was correct in his conjecturethat the News and Stocks apps were proof-of-concept of a generalized portability technology.
336 2018-06-04 21:06:05 No wonder you fools are confused you vote for idiots that flip flop so much you don't know who did what and when no history or Civic's classes makes for a bad education Why did Obama APPROVE bump stocks? @NRA? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
337 2018-06-04 21:05:24 so slow, you had to post stocks haha
338 2018-06-04 21:05:23 Massive deficit, businesses closing, moving production abroad, tax cut for industries allowed them to  buy back stocks, not expand.Tariff retaliation now hitting US farming and other industries, crops rotting in fields as US citizens don't want hard work.
339 2018-06-04 21:04:50 Well you still have 6 more years to cry about it I'm sure Kleenex stocks Will Keep On The Rise as well..good thing!

347 2018-06-04 21:03:42 All NYSE listed stocks. Indicies rotating is just normal behaviour and you shouldn't interpret too much into this. One of them will lead. I prefer to watch the important stocks. FAANNG stocks +$MSFT are most important as they are needed as a money sponge.
348 2018-06-04 21:03:42 Awesome to hear! 
349 2018-06-04 21:03:34 Wow talk about ass backwards.  No comment sense law exists yet and that is what we are all fighting for.  Banning bump stocks, background checks on all sales (private included) for example.
350 2018-06-04 21:03:10 Starbucks CEO and Chairman of the Board Howard Schultz OUT at Starbucks immediately!
      Stocks plunge!!
351 2018-06-04 21:02:45 Uninformed as usual.  
If you knew anything about bump stocks, you'd understand tgat the crowd in Vegas was lucky he did use them. 
They make the shooter very inaccurate. He would have killed more without using them.
352 2018-06-04 21:02:25 I am still shocked that we even have to demand that bump stocks be banned - this is as no-brainer as a no-brainer could be. But yes, here goes -

I demand that bump stocks be banned in EVERY state in America. Now.

354 2018-06-04 21:02:16 Because the constitution gives every adult in America the right to own and bear arms! Bump stocks do not make a semi automatic rifle any more or less dangerous than it is! No reason law abiding citizens should give up our rights! Some people should raise their kids to not bully!

368 2018-06-04 20:59:14 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
369 2018-06-04 20:58:32 @RepBlainePress where are the wage increases so far only billionaieres are benefiting corporations make more and buy back stocks no wage increases whats good for the rich is not all the people
370 2018-06-04 20:58:21 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
371 2018-06-04 20:58:01 Seasonality is just part of the grand cycle. Everything is cyclical in nature. Want proof of seasonality? Just go look at how nature spins, oscillates or vibrates. Seasonality in stocks and sectors and markets should be no surprise.
372 2018-06-04 20:56:47 when i buy stocks for value, it's a big like throwing spaghetti against the wall - some won't stick (and will be thrown back to the market) and others will stick and start to rise

381 2018-06-04 20:51:53 Even the smallest solutions, like opposition to bump stocks, is given the same "all-or-nothing" treatment by gun advocates, as though these in any way prevent them from owning or using their guns. And that's just a RECENT example of stubborn opposition.
382 2018-06-04 20:51:36 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
383 2018-06-04 20:51:09 @ChuckGrassley why are the corn and soybean markets way down but the stocks are way up ? Where is the oversight committee when @realDonaldTrump tweets about the job report before it ever came out. Alot of insiders made a fortune.  Pure corruption !
384 2018-06-04 20:49:50 Maybe it's just another way for the Trump family to make more money on the stock market. Use tariffs or the threat of tariffs to cause some industry stocks to go down and then: "Buy Low" so you can eventually "Sell High".
385 2018-06-04 20:49:34 Ha! 
386 2018-06-04 20:48:36 Any chance of you banning bump stocks? I keep seeing communities accross the country banning them . Save every one time and $ do it at the federal level. Also how about you raise the minimum age to 21 for firearm purchases?
387 2018-06-04 20:47:47 Nothing about bump stocks. It's also been disproven that bump stocks were used in LV. But you go ahead and continue believing the "official narrative."
388 2018-06-04 20:46:53 Is this a positive move for NCLT stocks?

394 2018-06-04 20:43:46 Yeah it’s not like I’m naive and don’t think they already do. But displaying news recommended by AI right in Stocks app is… maybe too much? What if it gets biased and starts displaying only good news under AAPL stock?

397 2018-06-04 20:43:07 Yea but my 401(k) is only growing at like 1.3% as compared to around 15% last year and I've lost $700 in stocks already so if you could fix all that, it would be great!
398 2018-06-04 20:42:59 Unless you're incredibly lucky you have to own a bunch of stocks that suck in order to own one Netflix
399 2018-06-04 20:42:38 Depends always. Always had stocks at decent valuations which have fallen. What's "good value" etc we will need to speak about in a couple years; anyhow many will fall more.

408 2018-06-04 20:36:55 Yes indeed, and there was some great other stuff as well! But imho I don’t think app updates for Stocks and Voice Memos fit in the keynote.
409 2018-06-04 20:36:49 Okay Apple, the iPads get Stocks and Voice Memos apps but can we get a pre-installed calculator and weather app?! #WWDC18
410 2018-06-04 20:36:18 The Stocks app is the dark horse from this keynote. Adding an Apple News interface for business news is actually pretty brilliant.

413 2018-06-04 20:35:08 At least the new stocks app is better than the last few years I give them that, which has news too.
414 2018-06-04 20:34:25 Rich old men with stocks in those businesses, some who own those businesses. Won't let things change. And pay politicians to keep it that way

416 2018-06-04 20:34:03 How about he fulfill his promises about gun age and bump stocks
417 2018-06-04 20:31:46 It is enough for my use case which is checking a few times a day how my stocks and some others are doing. Have never looked at other apps because it is enough for me personally
418 2018-06-04 20:31:39 Ouh là. J'espère qu'ils avaient encore des stocks de synthétique de derrière le rideau de fer.

420 2018-06-04 20:30:47 GE down 2.8%.  Two stocks, BA and HD, accounted for 31% of the Dow's move.  Looks AMZN, AAPL and MSFT carried a large % of the SPX plus short-squeeze stocks.  GE's sell-off should raise eyebrows - but it won't
421 2018-06-04 20:30:11 Buying undervalued stocks is the strategy. $pkg will have its day...Toronto expansion will change things dramatically.

424 2018-06-04 20:29:18 I agree...answers and comments must be concise and to the point to get through more stocks. Keep doing such a great job at hosting.
425 2018-06-04 20:28:52 I mean who doesn’t like Stocks?! 

Then again I really love the attention towards older devices. Apple shows appreciation to its customers this way, unlike a certain other ”camp”, which renders devices useless within 1 year.

461 2018-06-04 20:09:44 Mr. Law Enforcement, what is your opinion on bump stocks?
462 2018-06-04 20:09:38 The stocks app was updated.  It was mentioned multiple times.
463 2018-06-04 20:08:22 after getting used to your .22 I'd suggest getting an AR-15 because in the current market you can buy them dirt ass cheap, ammo is everywhere and cheap, and the aftermarket (3rd party attachments like rails, grips, stocks etc) is massive
464 2018-06-04 20:07:51 Stocks finish modestly higher in afterglow of bullish Friday jobs report. Dow +178, +0.7% to 24,813.

Nasdaq +0.7%, S&P +0.4%
465 2018-06-04 20:07:34 You can pretty much say this about all alt coins at present time. These market values are nothing compared to some stocks with no current use and possibly no future.
466 2018-06-04 20:07:27 Thank you. Never saw that video... And just realized I have so many of such stocks that I need to edit and publish  We shall make time.

474 2018-06-04 20:05:13 The weather app and calculator on iPad should be before stocks!!

476 2018-06-04 20:04:27 That’s totally not true. Bungie is contractually obligated to make a base game with 3 DLC’s and then repeat. They also have deadlines, if they don’t put out a DLC on time then Activision gets a part of their stocks. Bungie also had to renegotiate there deal and had to put MT in.

4) Have the DOJ prosecute enemies
5) Commit treason, Self-pardon

482 2018-06-04 20:02:18 I highly doubt that you are.  In case I'm wrong, I believe that bump stocks and any platform riffle with more than 3 rounds should be illegal.  I believe that there need to be tighter restrictions and longer wait times on buying guns of any kind.  For a start.
483 2018-06-04 20:01:52 They have been having a hard time these last couple months lol my stocks had a hard time getting over certain prices lol

492 2018-06-04 19:57:39 All I know is that bump stocks were used to kill 58+ and injure 400+ last October, w hundreds of bullets fired per minute. We can prevent death of this magnitude
493 2018-06-04 19:57:01 with respect...not always. price discovery is important. in crypto we have no earning reports etc so the retraces are deeep.  in stocks there is. thus there are fundamental reasons a good company can go sideways and consolidate instead of just get smashed.
494 2018-06-04 19:56:17 No, but usually stocks are limited for collector's.
495 2018-06-04 19:55:38 Thank you very much your Excellency for this Innovative Hub. I believe Edo youths would see this as an avenue to learn, interact and create a network to share ideas to improve ICT in government, agricultural, medical, tax, payrolls, economy, markets, trade/stocks, oil, etc.
496 2018-06-04 19:55:33 I’m actually very into most of the things announced today sans Watch, Stocks, and News. (Actually News on the Mac might get more use than the phone for me.) Especially excited for Memoji, the new Notification controls, and Desktop Stacks.
497 2018-06-04 19:55:21 What stocks should I buy my sister for her graduation present?
498 2018-06-04 19:55:16 Cut your hair so you can see that bump stocks dont make shootings stop. In reality full-auto fire rate is less accurate than semi-auto.
499 2018-06-04 19:55:11 I see consumer discretionary stocks and technology and internet stocks ripping to new highs all over the place. Seems pretty broad-based to me. Not sure what these bears are looking at...
500 2018-06-04 19:54:57 2/7 Here is my reply: The Dow does not have an impact on the poor & disenfranchised, as they don't have any stocks. The poor work jobs that do not offer 401Ks. Foreign policy under is abhorrent, especially w/ our allies.  His environmental policies are destroying our environment.
501 2018-06-04 19:54:44 I am on board with bump stocks ban. It circumvents laws that prevent fully auto functions.. but AR15s are just semi auto rifles that look scary. If the issue with an AR is it's semi auto function, there are other semi auto rifles to consider.
502 2018-06-04 19:53:09 Glad to see Voice Memos and Stocks come to the iPad, but where are Weather and Calculator?
503 2018-06-04 19:53:06 #stocks SBRCY?
504 2018-06-04 19:52:42 Go buy some oil stocks. Then you’ll be smiling every time you fill up. Instead of looking at how much your spending on gas you’ll be looking at your dividends checks your receiving.
505 2018-06-04 19:51:57 And when this happen the Nintendo stocks going to stabilize, this is the 101 of stock market
506 2018-06-04 19:50:43 Chile according to the sticker. We have a fruit delivery service at work that stocks our breakroom twice a week and I snagged this guy last week before the Devices group could raid the basket. It wasn't ripe enough on Thursday so it let it sit on my desk all weekend.

Dirty rotten scoundrels need putting in stocks on the market square! 
512 2018-06-04 19:48:23 @COFInvesting I'm trying to transfer stocks from another account to my CapOne investing account. They're asking me for a DTC account. Where do I find this. ?
513 2018-06-04 19:48:16 There was quite a lot of gimmicky or superfluous features in there, building on the precedent of animoji.  Who really cares about News and Stocks (except Apple employees)?  The whole point of those was really, iOS apps coming to macOS.
514 2018-06-04 19:48:14 If you analyze the whole year and make your assumption with that information you obviously going to invest on Nintendo, and with this downhill trend everybody is looking for your stocks. Think about it if you are cheaper than yesterday you willingly going to buy more.
515 2018-06-04 19:48:00 Start buying stocks in aunt jemina 
Cuz the good stuff is staying in Canada 
516 2018-06-04 19:47:44 finally… you can now add stocks to Stocks on the Watch, on the watch. Now where is my Stocks on Apple TV 4K?
517 2018-06-04 19:47:15 #WWDC18 in one tweet. iOS detects tounges, grouped notifications (groundbreaking) Suck it, Android. macOS gets dark mode, we want to grind your gears so badly by never putting it in iOS, Stocks app added.

521 2018-06-04 19:45:24 I also own stocks. We’re not poor, but I’ve been poor, been a single Mom. I very much care about the plight of poor ppl, especially disabled poor ppl. Disabled have the highest per capita poverty rates of any other group by FAR. Disabled POC, more so
522 2018-06-04 19:44:35 LOL! Silly Retail frequently underestimates ARRY. I never want to see any of my stocks trending, because I know a big bullseye is on them from Day Traders, and I have to work a little harder than I like to keep ahead of them.
523 2018-06-04 19:44:32 Mm not really Nintendo don't  need that much is a high stock market company, a rise is expected, also if they drop enough everybody wants to buy them stocks, so as I already said, you're right that is a trend a downhill one but a short term trend
524 2018-06-04 19:44:07 Take more of their stocks and get hit less.

Real talk I'm excited to see you get better. Keep making MI proud!

532 2018-06-04 19:40:16 Stocks updates. And Stocks on Mac.
533 2018-06-04 19:40:16 The tax cuts lead to massive market inevitability while decreasing disposable income for over 70% of the population which leads to a few quarters of gains in mkt value with wild swings followed by a rapid downturn. (Just like when W did it).

534 2018-06-04 19:40:06 The hunches were right, Home, News, Stocks, and Voice Memos were ported from iOS to macOS with few changes. Marzipan in action! #WWDC18
535 2018-06-04 19:39:57 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
536 2018-06-04 19:39:19 I’m sure Steve could tell you this is pretty low-hanging fruit. Every dev knows how to e.g. ‘nm /Applications/Stocks.app/Contents/MacOS/Stocks’, and given the immediate Twitter speculation it’s probably the first thing many would have done.
537 2018-06-04 19:39:13 This wasn't at 3PM this was at 2:30PM and what happened on $SGLB might not happen on $AETI.  They're not the same stock. There are stocks that held up too recently as well or washed out hard around the same time just to bounce back.
538 2018-06-04 19:38:23 Hi Mary, I can see that our Eastville Bristol store stocks our B Active multivitimans minerals which are low in stock but will have a delivery late this evening.

539 2018-06-04 19:38:03 bruh, i trade stocks, crypto, and invest. nothing soy about putting 6 figures in multiple bank accounts and owning a home. it's called providing and being a positive role model.
540 2018-06-04 19:37:25 Suspect Stocks and Voice Memo needed the time to set the stage for Marzipan.
541 2018-06-04 19:37:06 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
542 2018-06-04 19:36:14 Growth stocks stockscontinue to act the very well. Continue to buy favorites
543 2018-06-04 19:36:12 It was recognized as one of the best stocks of the millennium by The Motley Fool[23] and featured as a hot growth company in BusinessWeek.[24]
544 2018-06-04 19:36:09 If I kept a close eye on all the stocks I own I would not be able to live the rest of my life. I would just keep thinking about if I will be able to retire (and current US politics have me jittery enough)
545 2018-06-04 19:34:59 $AETI $1.81  pullback  watching for possible AH rebound!
546 2018-06-04 19:34:56 #China mainland Stocks are to be included in MSCI in August..it would reduce India's weightage in MSCI from 8.48% (appx $140 bn) to 8.46% (just 2 bps) which will be impacting India. FIIs outflow is estimated to be just Rs 2212 Cr..so no big impact as of now due to this fact.
547 2018-06-04 19:34:41 I have no interest in the stocks app I would have preferred the weather app 
548 2018-06-04 19:34:26 Stocks are launched via IPO which has a target starting price. That's the difference between regulated and unregulated markets. You cant just list a stock on a random new exchange legally. Otherwise, you would probably see these kind of exploits there too.
549 2018-06-04 19:34:14 thete were multiple sections devoted to the Stocks app
550 2018-06-04 19:33:59 Risks: SA selling +200kbd from stocks-raise draw to ~10MMbl/Mo
Ru +300kbd year end will meet increased domestic demand. 
SPR My guess is 50MMbl as gas approaches $3.50
Demand dest. 400kbd yoy
Releases will reduce chance of price shock-longer rally = more $$$
551 2018-06-04 19:33:47 Of course. 
Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not government.
552 2018-06-04 19:33:43 News とか Stocks とかちゃんと UIKit で作ったのかな...。練習ってわけか。
553 2018-06-04 19:33:42 I know that the stocks app will be the who needs it hot take to take but I am actually looking forward to that update because I use the app a lot
554 2018-06-04 19:33:26 $STUDY - once the again the market exposes and punishes every insecurity.  The stocks I sold on Friday - $OKTA, $MDB $SQ $BZUN - push higher.  The ones I bought today are fine  $ALTR $KEYS $TCMD - but nowhere near the power of the others.
555 2018-06-04 19:33:16 They are officially called Trump stocks from now...
556 2018-06-04 19:33:04 Duck I will buy from wherever stocks them. I’ve seen them as far north as Manchester, but truly believe they should be everywhere. They are boss.
557 2018-06-04 19:33:04 For options traders, hope you find this useful. I looked at weekly price change  of some liquid stocks over a period of 5 yrs. I considered 5%,7% and 10%. Results are attached in pics. For Indices I took 10 Yr period. (1/n)
558 2018-06-04 19:32:34 We should take thgs positively bt at the same time the facts / reality should nt be ignored..as of tdays closing one can pinpoint 100 stocks wch look cheap I'm just saying tht relative valuation bias exits in markets I.e. until the said 100 gt expensive no outlk hdil wnt  mve up
559 2018-06-04 19:32:23 Totally, to not serve someone based on an inherent characteristic is ridiculous, and THEY should be ridiculed for it. We should bring back stocks ;0)
Although social media appears to be more and more the modern day equivalent.

565 2018-06-04 19:30:42 These are both extremely volatile (higher risk) stocks and where they go short term now is anyone's guess.  Much easier stocks to trade than these.
566 2018-06-04 19:30:08 Still no weather and calculator app for iPad. But we get the stocks app? Who uses the stocks app??
567 2018-06-04 19:30:02 Well, let's see what repubs do 2 address povety. Cut spending for education. Lie about manufacturing & coal mining coming back. Give tax breaks to top 1%. Make excuses when Co's like Harley Davidson buy back stocks & fires 800 employees before moving overseas. Great solutions!

574 2018-06-04 19:28:08 SO MANY STOCKS.
575 2018-06-04 19:28:05 When do the Stocks open? Don't United love to do shit just before then?
576 2018-06-04 19:27:55 No ur not right,
577 2018-06-04 19:27:17 Ban bump stocks!! Now!! #how2savelives
578 2018-06-04 19:26:54 agreed, it’s strange and worrying how much screen time the stocks app received. On multiple platforms
579 2018-06-04 19:26:21 I’m with you. Ban bump stocks.
580 2018-06-04 19:26:04 It got Stocks, man, Stocks!

584 2018-06-04 19:25:24 I'm secretly hoping for portfolio tracking in the new Stocks app. I'm probably wishing for too much.
585 2018-06-04 19:25:22 More times than not, stocks overshoot. Calling tops isn't easy
586 2018-06-04 19:25:21 That #WWDC2018 could have been half the length without the gimmicky demos (dark mode - we get it! , memoji , Stocks & News ), but there was some cool stuff in there too - CreateML is interesting, and iOS apps on macOS could just be enough to save the MacBook line?
587 2018-06-04 19:25:19 You are delusional..

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Is he afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
588 2018-06-04 19:24:57 I can’t wait to delete the Stocks app from my Mac
589 2018-06-04 19:24:33 In your post-Apocalyptic vision, none will own cars. Their grandparents will have to die sometime, freeing up housing stocks.
590 2018-06-04 19:24:22 Donny got 20 million from NRA during his 2016-2017 campaign and 10 Million after he got elected. That is why he's not doing anything about bump stocks or age.

like just because they both have 2 stocks and do damage and are SA2, that doesn't mean it's a worse version of Chun's? or even related?

it wasn't even conversationally relevant, why r ppl like this

- AR pushing
- Stocks and Voice Memo stage time
- no monetization talk at all

Love: 
- performance focus

- DND and notifications
599 2018-06-04 19:21:48 What about stocks on Mac? Wow! How exiting. #wwdc
600 2018-06-04 19:20:26 If this "Fake Trade Deficit" is as bad as you claim, then why do my AMERICAN Stocks take a huge dive and stay lower every time YOU impose or announce another tariff? My portfolio hasn't recovered to the level they were under OBAMA since you took office. If this is MAGA, shove it!
601 2018-06-04 19:19:46 Glad to hear it. Read the article.  Mandatory locking up of guns, universal background checks, ban weapons used in wars, ban bump stocks, etc.  Gun buy back programs, ...
602 2018-06-04 19:19:14 Hey, Stocks got a lot more screen time than I was expecting. *blush* Proud to work with such a great team on a really great rewrite.
603 2018-06-04 19:18:55 Them stocks is where it's at fr we don't gotta work for nobody!!
604 2018-06-04 19:18:40 Currently, tweets about Stocks are 24% positive, 72% neutral, and 4% negative.
605 2018-06-04 19:18:33 Помню, как люди предрекали, что вот ща Apple выкатит единый App Store и Mac на своих процессорах и просто вздрючит MS  в их же идее. И где это все? Тут News и Stocks на macOS!!!

Apples on app Stocks is an example. Will people use websites less if there is a native macOS variant?
610 2018-06-04 19:17:32 Banning bump stocks

617 2018-06-04 19:16:44 I have a feeling the Stocks app is literally the least-launched app on iOS. 
618 2018-06-04 19:16:44 Wait, iOS and macOS don't update till the fall? How am I supposed to check my stocks before then?!
619 2018-06-04 19:16:41 But you can configure your touch bar to launch the Stocks App and Top News App.
620 2018-06-04 19:15:56 iOS apps coming to macOS in 2019. Starting with Apple’s Voice Memos, Home, News, and Stocks in #macOSMojave

621 2018-06-04 19:15:41 $ASYS 20% decline in 1 day is a mini bear mkt.  micro cap stocks get these kind of moves.  Need to pick the spots. Low $8s seems good to buy
622 2018-06-04 19:15:28 We’ve heard everyone ask why the Weather app isn’t on the iPad for years. 

So here’s what we did … we brought Stocks to the iPad!
623 2018-06-04 19:15:21 Stocks app 30 times. Maybe devs do a lot of investing.
624 2018-06-04 19:14:54 Parfois c'est pas une histoire de stocks dispo en centres de vaccinations et pas en pharmacie de villes ?

631 2018-06-04 19:12:51 iOS apps coming to macOS in 2019. Starting with Apple’s Voice Memos, Home, News, and Stocks in #macOSMojave
632 2018-06-04 19:12:36 2018 and apple made a fuss about the stocks app! It seems like the glory days are behind them. This is like Microsoft in 2002 #WWDC18
633 2018-06-04 19:12:05 なるほど、macOSのセクションでiOSアプリの移植の話ばっかりだったのは、伏線だったのね。News、Stocks、Voice Memoは、iOSアプリのコードを、現在開発中のUIKit for macOSでコンバートしたもの。来年には、一般のデベロッパーも、この機能を使ってiOSアプリをmacOSに移植できるようになる
634 2018-06-04 19:12:03 WWDC: Aha. Stocks was a NUKit demo. Makes more sense now.
635 2018-06-04 19:12:02 ...even though there's tools to help in "porting" #iOS apps to #macOS (as used by @Apple with the News and Stocks apps)
636 2018-06-04 19:11:58 Hey Mac devs, we're giving you UIKit, but not til 2019. Just play with Stocks or something until then.  #wwdc #wwdc18 #wwdc2018
637 2018-06-04 19:11:48 iOS apps porting to the Mac is huge news. Open to Apple only apps this year but coming to developers in 2019. News, stocks, voice memos and home in Mojave are all ported iOS apps #WWDC18
638 2018-06-04 19:11:29 Disappointed that they took UIKit and put it on the Mac. Stocks and co look like iOS apps on the Mac, not like Mac apps. 

I’m afraid this will make it too easy to bring low-quality apps from iOS to macOS.
639 2018-06-04 19:11:10 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
640 2018-06-04 19:11:00 Did you illustrate all of that? Or was it just stocks, dope either way :P
641 2018-06-04 19:10:58 Pues ya está confirmado. News o Stocks están hechas con UIKit ejecutándose en el Mac y los desarrolladores podremos usarlo en 2019. ¡Bravo Apple!
642 2018-06-04 19:10:58 むしろ今起きたけど
643 2018-06-04 19:10:49 С такой помпой рассказали, что News и Stocks имеют схожий код теперь на iOS и MacOS... А я как разработчик сижу и думаю:"А раньше это было чем-то невозможным??? Раньше почему было иначе? WTF?" #WWDC18
644 2018-06-04 19:10:43 Federighi: "No, we're not merging iOS apps with MacOS." 

Five minutes later: "We're bringing tools for you enable iOS apps on Mac next year, just like we did with Stocks, Voice Memos and Apple News." #WWDC18
645 2018-06-04 19:10:42 I've never heard stocks mentioned positively at all.
646 2018-06-04 19:10:39 Aaaahhh, THAT’S why there was all the News and Stocks stuff. iOS APIs and Frameworks on macOS.
647 2018-06-04 19:10:24 Stocks and stacks and stocks and stacks.

649 2018-06-04 19:10:22 According to industry sources, sugar prices have dropped to about ₹26 a kg against the cost of production of about ₹36. This means at ex-factory level sugar mills are losing about ₹10/kg. Even MSP of ₹29 as shown by CNBC may not be sweet for sugar stocks.
650 2018-06-04 19:10:17 Except, you know, the economy, jobs market, especially for minorities, crime trending down, borders more secure, better trade deals, NK at the negotiating table, stocks up hugely, incomes rising, military strong, and VA being cleaned up, among other things. Beyond that...?
651 2018-06-04 19:10:14 Say Stocks one more time. I dare you. I double dare you.
652 2018-06-04 19:10:14 Bring your iOS apps to the Mac available to Developers next year (Currently being tested with Apple's News, Stocks and Home Apps) #WWDC18
653 2018-06-04 19:10:08 No you only get Stocks. Lots and lots of Stocks.
654 2018-06-04 19:09:58 I’ve never heard stocks mentioned so much
655 2018-06-04 19:09:54 なるほど。だから News と Stocks、ボイスメモとホームで macOS に統合された UIKit を使って作ったと。

2019年には他の開発者にも開放する。

#WWDC18 #WWDC #AppleEvent
656 2018-06-04 19:09:40 Phase 1 Verschmelzung. iOS Apps kommen langsam auf den MAC. Erste Schritte sehen wir schon mit News, Stocks and Recorder. Weitere Infos folgen 2019 für Entwickler. #wwdc18
657 2018-06-04 19:09:34 Woo! Stocks coming to macOS 
I look forward to deleting it as soon as i upgrade.....
658 2018-06-04 19:09:33 MacApp now have some support from UIKit (from iOS Apps). This explains why Stocks, News and Voice Memos are now on MacOS #WWDC18
659 2018-06-04 19:09:33 The Stocks app is the app I'm going to be making fun of/loving for the rest of the day
660 2018-06-04 19:09:33 Stop saying Stocks
661 2018-06-04 19:09:31 lmao I love how they actually included stocks and voice memos in their major features list
662 2018-06-04 19:09:26 Big day for the Stocks and Voice Memos app teams.
663 2018-06-04 19:09:26 No iOS on the Mac until 2019. BUT WE’VE STILL GOT THE NEW STOCKS! #WWDC
664 2018-06-04 19:09:22 If you have tripled the money in one -two years  is obscenely better than stocks or traditional investments ...
665 2018-06-04 19:09:08 Apple brought some of its own apps from iOS to Mac (News, Stocks, Voice Memos, Home) to macOS this year and it plans to open this up to developers next year.
666 2018-06-04 19:09:06 There’s a really weird amount of focus on the Stocks app
667 2018-06-04 19:09:03 And Stocks! Don't forget Stocks!
668 2018-06-04 19:08:58 In 2019 iOS developers will be able to more easily move their apps to Mac. In the meantime, macOS Mojave features four apps Apple translated using this tech: News, Stocks, Voice Recorder, and Home.
669 2018-06-04 19:08:55 I am not going to enjoy stocks at home, Craig
670 2018-06-04 19:08:55 Apple is working on bringing some iOS apps to the Mac. Still a work in progress, it’s already bringing it’s own iOS apps News, Stocks, and Home apps to MacOS Mojave.
671 2018-06-04 19:08:55 Cherry picking with no data to support it, as expected, target took a 10% jump in 4th quarter revenue, it’s stocks surge 15% in 2018, they outselled Walmart online last Holliday’s, I could go at it one by one. But you don’t care, you care for what Foxnews tells you.
672 2018-06-04 19:08:45 Phase 1: iOS apps moved to Mac include News, Stocks, Voice Memos, Home #WWDC
673 2018-06-04 19:08:42 Pois bem
Ta ai publico

News, Home, Voice Control e Stocks são os apps de iPad rodando no Mac
674 2018-06-04 19:08:41 Now we know why we got Stocks for macOS guys
675 2018-06-04 19:08:22 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Average INDEX: 59.04
676 2018-06-04 19:08:20 AND STOCKS 
677 2018-06-04 19:08:15 "We've taken some key frameworks from iOS and brought them to the Mac," says Federighi. Using these frameworks, Apple brought Apple News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home to macOS. Told ya. #WWDC18 #macOS
678 2018-06-04 19:08:10 Stocks again! #WWDC #BestKeynoteEver
679 2018-06-04 19:07:53 Yeah, but how much more $$$ will I make now that the Stocks app has news ;)
680 2018-06-04 19:07:48 Today, porting an app from iOS to macOS is a pain. So taking key frameworks from iOS and adapting to the Mac. Phase 1: Testing on ourselves. Brought Home, News, Stocks, Voice Memos to the Mac with very few code changes.
681 2018-06-04 19:07:34 Bill Clinton told a reporter he did "the right thing" in the Lewinsky scandal: "I bought a bunch of cigar company stocks."
682 2018-06-04 19:06:55 QUESTION: you know what I like best about trading stocks?

I like it when I turn the market with the first higher bid on a few hundred shares and get nothing after it trades my price several times. So good and fair!
683 2018-06-04 19:06:50 New blog will be up shortly on $EOS. Was thinking of writing one on the dangers on penny stocks, $BTC, #TheSTREAK, and another over the difference between a trade and a scalp.

What would you like me to write a blog on next? Feel free to reply or DM me with suggestions!
684 2018-06-04 19:06:29 News, Stocks, Voice Memos, new App Store… looks like Marzipan is real.
685 2018-06-04 19:05:42 Toda la razón, sentimiento bajista. Institucionales acumulan y la suben.
686 2018-06-04 19:05:38 Something tells me pot stocks are coming into play $AMMJ $CBIS $MCIG $MCOA $GRNH $VAPE you name it
687 2018-06-04 19:05:31 Don't you ignore stocks!
688 2018-06-04 19:04:11 new Mac App Store is built in Cocoa and doesn’t suck, Dark Mode on Mojave confirmed, Safari privacy enhancements, new screenshot tool, Home/Stocks/News ported from iOS
689 2018-06-04 19:03:22 Many does the shifting of stocks..
Uski wajah se bhi ho jaata hai gadbad..
690 2018-06-04 19:03:21 News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home sure do look like they share a lot of code with their iOS counterparts. #wwdc
691 2018-06-04 19:02:31 Microsoft  to buy GitHub for $7.5 billion.

693 2018-06-04 19:02:17 Stocks on my Mac? Sweeet!
694 2018-06-04 19:01:58 have your stocks lost their energy?
695 2018-06-04 19:01:47 Also as an outsider to the iOS and Mac world, after watching #WWDC18, was there seriously some severe lack of ways to look at Stocks or something before today?
696 2018-06-04 19:01:38 Apple is bringing Stocks app to iPad, it only took them 8 years…
697 2018-06-04 19:01:34 Would you mind sharing with us your daily routine how to find stocks, OTC (breakouts) to trade? If there are some youtube or blogs etc…  to watch or read, please share with us.@SublimeTrades
698 2018-06-04 19:01:08 Two weeks ago,we learned 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico. Top Story:Racist moron loses her prime time sitcom.Last week,stocks crashed as the President imposed crippling sanctions on Canada&on the EU for NO REASON!Top Story:TBS entertainer is rude to Ivanka. FUCK,are we this dumb

700 2018-06-04 19:01:05 Ptn taleur avant le concours de tractions je fesais mort le mec surtout quand tout le monde m’a applaudit mais une fois les mains misent sur la bar j’ai eu le stresse qui est monté et les bras tétanisés mais j’en ai quand même fais 20 soit autant que bcp des renois stocks
701 2018-06-04 19:00:53 Madam, could you suggest 1 or 2 stocks for 2__3 months which deliver 25--30% return? I'm not kidding. Please help
702 2018-06-04 19:00:41 stocks less than 2 dollars per share are too crazy to short for me..too unpredictable
703 2018-06-04 19:00:31 $SPX up while all my stocks are down.
704 2018-06-04 19:00:25 I think all US markets are overvalued by 50% or more. Your beloved FED has pushed too far this time and companies are frothing in cash and pumped up stocks with buy-backs and junk bonds and cheap debt! 22 trillions USD in debt. It’s a big Circus
705 2018-06-04 18:59:39 .@apple is clearly testing out Marzipan (UIKit on macOS) with Stocks and Mac App Store. Both look like iPad apps on the desktop.
706 2018-06-04 18:59:31 I've got enough tire tracks on my ass to know btr than shorting $NFLX type stocks. But longs gotta be holding on based on Jonestown-type faith.
I understand the inherent prods differences b/w what NFLX and $TSLA sell, but the income statement & b/s aren't that different
707 2018-06-04 18:59:18 I'd suggest the iPhone stocks app it would be a good place to hide em
708 2018-06-04 18:58:54 A surprising number of retail stocks hitting new 52wk highs today. $M $TJX $KSS $RL $TIF $XRT
709 2018-06-04 18:58:49 Brew cask install stocks && Brew cask install news
710 2018-06-04 18:58:48 The new App Store has the same feel as the new Stocks app. New design style different from prior Mac apps.
711 2018-06-04 18:58:40 Stocks is coming to Mac and iPad.
712 2018-06-04 18:58:36 Just finished two projects and about to start a lucrative third this week! I'm becoming a podcasting motherfucker! Now, back to my stocks! Makin' the $$$!!!  #YearOfTheFleet
713 2018-06-04 18:58:31 That App Store really looks like News, Stocks and Voice Memos. Almost like it’s using the same technology.
714 2018-06-04 18:58:30 MAS Looks like the stocks app  #WWDC18
715 2018-06-04 18:58:11 #WWDC18 Along with Apple News and Stocks, Voice Memos is coming to the Mac for the first time, and so is the Home app.
716 2018-06-04 18:58:01 Can we please agree to urgently delete/destroy all references, recipes, memory, stocks, etc of/for/to Caramel Pots of Joy? It's for the good of humanity. My ability to resist them is nil.
*heads to the fridge*
717 2018-06-04 18:57:34 they spent all their design budget on the new stocks app
718 2018-06-04 18:57:23 Have realised the only person to listen to in stocks and shares is myself, and listening to others no matter how successful they are just ends up in a loss, and that includes their trading techniques/strategies/risk management. Less is more.
719 2018-06-04 18:57:20 the mac app store is now implemented inside apple news and stocks
720 2018-06-04 18:56:59 With the Stocks and Voice Memo apps being redesigned and ported to iPad and macOS, do you think those could be a test for the said "Marzipan" project? #WWDC18
721 2018-06-04 18:56:56 Trump has caused the stocks of companies to go down with one tweet.
722 2018-06-04 18:56:53 Expecting a few stocks to plunge after Apple’s Safari new privacy features...
723 2018-06-04 18:56:50 When is Apple Stocks coming to Chrome OS though
724 2018-06-04 18:56:50 In vf if anybody wanna kill me....stocks and offers limited
725 2018-06-04 18:56:46 they're bringing the damn Stocks app to iPad in iOS 12 but apparently not Weather or Calculator... that is some next level trolling #WWDC18
726 2018-06-04 18:56:44 “The new App Store featuring APPLE NEWS AND STOCKS.”
727 2018-06-04 18:56:18 :) that’s exactly what I did. Also, my daytime schedule doesn’t allow me to check on stocks, which also helps.
728 2018-06-04 18:56:09 A great plot twist would be if they built News and Stocks with UIKit for iOS and macOS.
729 2018-06-04 18:56:03 U mean that is good for ip7 ??
Another question. Do u think after they but stocks and news together. People in non supporting countries for news app can get it?
730 2018-06-04 18:55:42 This is getting old... ok, pay attention... Avg Unempl.-Trump/4.8% Obama/7.44%, Avg. Stocks-Trump/Up 31.6%, Obama/up 25.8%, Avg GDP-Trump/UP 2.3%,Obama/DOWN 2.8%.. How is @realDonaldTrump a worse president, & how much worse off is the country now? (stats according to @CNN)
731 2018-06-04 18:55:37 First thought upon seeing Stocks & News on Mac (aside from being humored that Apple loves Stocks so much): they seem to be making a point of these default apps going across all the big screen OSes.  #WWDC2018
732 2018-06-04 18:55:29 Stocks and Voice Memos got shout-outs during two separate segments of the WWDC keynote. This has to be about a universal app platform.
733 2018-06-04 18:55:25 We don’t need Stocks.
We need current cryptocurrency price…

#WWDC #WWDC18
734 2018-06-04 18:55:15 News, Stocks, Voice Memos, & Home are all coming to the Mac which the experience would be great on a wider screen!   #WWDC18
735 2018-06-04 18:54:53 Prediction: the macOS Stocks/Voice Memos/Home apps will be iOS code running in Marzipan.
736 2018-06-04 18:54:48 Still hoping that MacOS will run ios apps or something similar. Maybe bringing all of UIKit over to Mac. How else would they bring News and Stocks over so quickly. I'd love to see twitter come back to the app area instead of only the browser. #WWDC18
737 2018-06-04 18:54:48 Lo que más me ha emocionado del evento de Apple es la actualización de la app Stocks.
738 2018-06-04 18:54:44 STOCKS ON MAC
739 2018-06-04 18:54:38 Weird saying this but I think the new stocks app in #iOS12 and #macOSMojave is going to get me to use the #AppleNews app more than I do currently #WWDC2018
740 2018-06-04 18:54:35 They added stories to the Stocks app. They also added emojis and animojis and the new Memojis to every god damn device on earth. All broadcasts in the future will be made using Memojis and animojis. We’re actually going to live in the “Emoji Movie”. Look at what you’ve done Jack
741 2018-06-04 18:54:34 News, Stocks, Voice Memos apps, brand new, on iPhone, iPad and Mac. And all look exactly the same… 

I wonder what’s behind this. 
742 2018-06-04 18:54:31 Stocks is a big thing added , waiting to listen : “Mitual funds are subject to market risk “ #wwdc18
743 2018-06-04 18:54:25 Apple is unifying its apps across platforms: News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home automation will all work on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. #WWDC18
744 2018-06-04 18:54:25 Stocks and Voice memos finally getting the long overdue attention they deserve. #WWDC18
745 2018-06-04 18:54:17 Apples releasing stuff like Home, Stocks and news on their various devices but where's Calculator on the iPad 

#WWDC18 @Apple
746 2018-06-04 18:54:14 Home, News, Voice Memos & Stocks Apps coming to macOS Mojave #WWDC2018
747 2018-06-04 18:54:04 please name companies so I know what stocks to short
748 2018-06-04 18:54:03 Apple brings four new apps to MacOS Mojave: “News”, “Stocks”, “Voice Memos” and “Home”. #wwdc2018
749 2018-06-04 18:54:02 News, Stocks, Voice Memo apps all coming to the Mac – a clear sign Apple has made it easier to bring iOS apps to the Mac.
750 2018-06-04 18:53:54 Apple News, Voice Memos, Stocks and Home apps coming to macOS #WWDC2018 @Apple
751 2018-06-04 18:53:50 don't think they've got much this year so they just use voice memos, news and stocks are just filler
752 2018-06-04 18:53:45 iPhone users: we hate the stocks app

Apple: the stocks app is now gonna be on your iPad and Mac too

#WWDC18
753 2018-06-04 18:53:39 Why didn’t Trump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when he said he would? Is he afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
754 2018-06-04 18:53:34 So, is stocks/voice maybe their dog food testing of a cross platform toolkit that’s coming next year?
755 2018-06-04 18:53:34 Wait, people still get excited about a “Stocks” app? I have no idea why I’d ever want it at all...
756 2018-06-04 18:53:30 Is that a glimpse at project Marzipan with News, Stocks and Home on macOS? #wwdc18 #macOS
757 2018-06-04 18:53:26 Finally, a little app parity across operating systems – News, Stocks, Home and Voice Memos all coming to the Mac. Now if we could only get the darn stock weather app on our iPads. #WWDC2018
758 2018-06-04 18:53:20 Stocks app on iPad and Mac, project marzipan is all but confirmed #WWDC18
759 2018-06-04 18:53:19 RT macrumorslive: Along with Apple News and Stocks, Voice Memos is also coming to the Mac for the first time, and so is the Home app.
760 2018-06-04 18:53:19 Wait, Stocks and Stacks are both coming to the Mac?!

When will Stecks, Sticks and Stucks be there?

#WWDC #macOS
761 2018-06-04 18:53:16 News, Stocks, Voice Memo and Home apps now available in the macOS. #WWDC2018
762 2018-06-04 18:53:11 #RT MacRumors: RT macrumorslive: Along with Apple News and Stocks, Voice Memos is also coming to the Mac for the first time, and so is the Home app.
763 2018-06-04 18:53:10 $TSLA stock on the new Stocks app demo from Apple..
Apple looking at what price to buy? 
764 2018-06-04 18:53:09 .@Apple will bring the News, Stocks, Voice Memos and the Home apps to the Mac. #WWDC18
765 2018-06-04 18:53:07 Stocks 
766 2018-06-04 18:53:05 New apps for MacOS (News, Stocks, Voice Memos Ana Home) look like they are built with shared iOS UI APIs.
767 2018-06-04 18:53:05 People reminding me about the Stocks Today addition and Dashboard widget are correct. This is gaslighting Stocks fans to make them think the Mac didn't already have this.
768 2018-06-04 18:53:03 You get a stocks app, and you get a stocks app. EVERYONE GETS A STOCKS APP! #WWDC2018
769 2018-06-04 18:52:59 Home and news and stocks for macOS mojave whoop de do #WWDC18
770 2018-06-04 18:52:58 Voice Memos is great to have, Stocks? Meh.
771 2018-06-04 18:52:57 Like is there really that many people monitoring stocks all the time on their phone app and mac? Seems like those folks would be all about bloomberg instead.. or something else?
772 2018-06-04 18:52:56 been keeping an eye on thier in stocks at stores for a while now. They are lasting.
773 2018-06-04 18:52:52 Definitely! I'm wondering when Apple will open Stocks to Crypto tho
774 2018-06-04 18:52:52 stocks is back on macOS and iPad
775 2018-06-04 18:52:45 Apple News and Stocks apps for Mac #WWDC18
776 2018-06-04 18:52:44 Porting #iOS apps to #macOSMojave ... News, Stocks, Voice Memos, Home ... #yawn #WWDC18
777 2018-06-04 18:52:43 Sometimes I feel like the team assigned to new features on macOS is Bighead's group at Hooli XYZ. The Stocks app gets keynote time?
778 2018-06-04 18:52:40 NewsとStocksがMacに来るのはありがたい
779 2018-06-04 18:52:39 Really simple almost direct ports of the iOS versions of Voice Memos, Stocks, and News. Eh. #WWDC18
780 2018-06-04 18:52:39 The new stocks app for mac looks a lot like the stocks app for iPad they announced today.. chances they are actually the same app?
781 2018-06-04 18:52:36 FINALLY: News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home are coming to macOS 

#WWDC2018
782 2018-06-04 18:52:31 The fact that Voices Memos, Stocks, Apple News and Home are coming from iPhone/iPad to macOS is just a test for Marzipan. Until next year!
783 2018-06-04 18:52:29 Woohoo. The new #Stocks app from #Apple is coming to the Mac as well as #iOS12. OMG. Let's all freak out. #WWDC18
784 2018-06-04 18:52:28 STOCKS 2 WOOOOOOOOOOOO
785 2018-06-04 18:52:25 News, Stocks, Voice Memos, Home... it could be said that these are iOS apps running on the Mac, aren’t they?
786 2018-06-04 18:52:24 @stroughtonsmith @_inside Stocks, Voice Memos and News on macOS look exactly like on iPad. Global apps hint? 
787 2018-06-04 18:52:23 News, Voice Memos, Stocks, and Home to join MacOS. #WWDC18
788 2018-06-04 18:52:23 Yes! Stocks on MacOS! I was kinda worried there #WWDC18
789 2018-06-04 18:52:21 Блять, когда сказали "Apps", я уж было подумал, что приложения с iOS заработают на mac... Но нет, просто представляете, news, stocks и home теперь будут на mac. Courage, не иначе #WWDC18
790 2018-06-04 18:52:21 When will he protect our kids?
Why didn’t Trump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when he said he would? Is he afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
791 2018-06-04 18:52:18 More stocks app, still no calculator for iPad tho?
792 2018-06-04 18:52:18 Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home are also coming to the Mac #WWDC18
793 2018-06-04 18:52:17 Stocks, Home and Voice Memos also get ported from macOS to iOS...sensing a theme? #WWDC18
794 2018-06-04 18:52:16 stocks app is the skyrim of @apple
795 2018-06-04 18:52:15 Everybody excited for all the new ways to check your stocks?
796 2018-06-04 18:52:14 New screenshots in macOS Mojave is so awesome with video capture and also the capture directly from iPhone camera feature with Stocks now integrated with Apple News #WWDC2018
797 2018-06-04 18:52:14 So you’re telling me that Pro users inspired Apple to add Stocks and Voice Memos to Mac? #WWDC
798 2018-06-04 18:52:13 I'm not watching #WWDC18 but can someone please let me know when they bring stocks back
799 2018-06-04 18:52:13 i never use news & stocks & homekit but memo is a welcome addition to #macOS #WWDC18
800 2018-06-04 18:52:13 2018 year of the Apple native stocks app #WWDC18
801 2018-06-04 18:52:13 Thank God that Stocks has been improved across all of our iOS devices. It was just too hard for those grown up frat boys to play poker with other people’s money before today.
802 2018-06-04 18:52:12 #WWDC #apple
#voicememos &

810 2018-06-04 18:52:05 Apple is bringing News, Stocks  Voice Memos and Home apps to the Mac in MacOS Mojave . Potentially handy. #WWDC18
811 2018-06-04 18:52:04 Hi @Apple, we do not care about Stocks, at all. 

#WWDC18 #AppleEvent
812 2018-06-04 18:52:04 @dmoren what C level executive love Stocks so much that gets it more development attention than tvOS?
813 2018-06-04 18:52:04 Stocks app is the first app everyone deletes... #WWDC18
814 2018-06-04 18:52:04 News, Stocks, Home and voice memos are the first integration between iOS and MacOS #WWDC18
815 2018-06-04 18:52:03 Who is asking for *more* stocks information?! #wwdc18 #idontunderstand
816 2018-06-04 18:52:02 Me parece TAN OBVIO que el Voice Memos y Stocks, etc, han sido creadas multiOS... si no llega hoy, llegará en la próxima. #wwdc18 #Apple
817 2018-06-04 18:52:01 News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home apps come to macOS. #WWDC18
818 2018-06-04 18:52:01 News app is coming to the Mac. Yet every country except US and UK is the only country that doesn’t exist.

Stocks app is also coming to the Mac. Incredibly rich.

Voice Memos too. This is an incredibly popular app for musicians. Bazzi uses it, The Chainsmokers uses it.
819 2018-06-04 18:51:59 Can you please let me know which are the factors pull the oil company stocks down like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL... like oil price increase etc.,?
820 2018-06-04 18:51:59 Whoa, Stocks on the Mac? I guess I can get rid of my iPhone now.

#wwdc
821 2018-06-04 18:51:58 Along with Apple News and Stocks, Voice Memos is also coming to the Mac for the first time, and so is the Home app.
822 2018-06-04 18:51:58 What’s up with the obsession Apple has with stocks, news and voice memo apps? Now also on the Mac. #MacOS #WWDC18
823 2018-06-04 18:51:56 Home, Stocks and Voice Memos app coming to macOS Mojave. #WWDC2018
824 2018-06-04 18:51:55 Oh thank goodness. macOS got Stocks and Voice Memos.
825 2018-06-04 18:51:55 Nieuwe apps voor macOS: News en Stocks, evenals Home en Voice Memo's.
826 2018-06-04 18:51:54 Does anyone use the Stocks app on the iPhone? I imagine both of them are quite excited about it cluttering up the iPad and Mac now.
827 2018-06-04 18:51:54 Voice memos & Stocks is coming to the Mac!!! Oh wait...Stocks & Voice Recorder are already Universal Appa on #Windows10
828 2018-06-04 18:51:54 Stocks and voice memos, project marzipan in action
829 2018-06-04 18:51:53 News and Stocks on the Mac. I wonder if this is the first use of Marzipan? They look similar to their iOS counterparts.
830 2018-06-04 18:51:53 News, Stocks, and Home looked a lot like iPad apps on the Mac... #WWDC18
831 2018-06-04 18:51:52 MacOS Mojave gains the all-new News, Stocks, and Voice Memos app.  Home also FINALLY comes to MacOS.
832 2018-06-04 18:51:52 Stocks is coming to the Mac too, with all the extra detail that’s being added to the iOS versions too. Voice Memos is coming to the Mac as well. Makes sense now you can sync recordings between devices via iCloud.
833 2018-06-04 18:51:51 I actually thought he said “We are bringing nudes to the Mac” — did people actually applaud that, and did he follow up with Stocks? Voice Memos? Desperate.
834 2018-06-04 18:51:50 So as a high school teacher you believe that somehow trump’s trickle down economics policy is going to work better than the other times it’s been tried because your stocks went up? 
835 2018-06-04 18:51:50 "Yay, stocks" said no one ever. #WWDC18
836 2018-06-04 18:51:50 Can't wait to use my iMac now it has the Stocks app.
837 2018-06-04 18:51:50 Stocks on iPad and Mac oh god do we deserve it #WWDC18
838 2018-06-04 18:51:49 I can’t wait to try stocks on the Mac! @vinnycoyne
839 2018-06-04 18:51:48 News、Stocks、ボイスメモ、HomeアプリもmacOSに！ #wwdc2018
840 2018-06-04 18:51:48 The Stocks app on macOS truly shows that Apple still cares about macOS.
841 2018-06-04 18:51:45 So do I use the Stocks App on macOS or the side Widget? Sooo many options.
842 2018-06-04 18:51:43 Big day for the Stocks app across Apple products 
843 2018-06-04 18:51:41 MacOS : Stocks on a plain #wwdc2018
844 2018-06-04 18:51:41 #VoiceMemos and #Stocks are also coming to the Mac! #WWDC18
845 2018-06-04 18:51:41 I'm really thrown off by all the Stocks HYPE.
846 2018-06-04 18:51:40 Does the Stocks app team have embarrassing photos of the executives? It's getting a lot of love onstage.
847 2018-06-04 18:51:40 That stocks app looks familiar. And news. And voice. 

Hmm, one more thing…? #WWDC18
848 2018-06-04 18:51:40 Are you excited for Stocks on mac and iPad?
849 2018-06-04 18:51:38 So who asked for Stocks on iPad & Mac? I need to know #WWDC
850 2018-06-04 18:51:37 Like I said with Stocks on iPad, where's my native Mac weather app!? #WWDC2018
851 2018-06-04 18:51:36 Anyone who actually trades stock doesn’t use the stocks app…
852 2018-06-04 18:51:36 News and Stocks coming to iPad, and macOS - a precursor to a new universal app platform announcement
853 2018-06-04 18:51:35 Stocks app coming to the Mac, again, FINALLY
854 2018-06-04 18:51:35 Stocks on Mac.

If I wasn't going to jump from 10.12.6 to 10.14 THEN... ;)
855 2018-06-04 18:51:34 ¡¡¡STOCKS EN MACOS!!!! 
856 2018-06-04 18:51:34 News and Stocks app for MacOS. Looks kinda slick but also looks like the kind of thing I'll just use the web for. #WWDC18
857 2018-06-04 18:51:34 But stocks!
858 2018-06-04 18:51:34 Apple News coming to the Mac.

860 2018-06-04 18:51:34 News, Voice Memos & Stocks Apps coming to macOS Mojave #WWDC2018
861 2018-06-04 18:51:34 News and Stocks use the common framework between iOS and macOS, right?
862 2018-06-04 18:51:32 Stocks man, Stocks!
863 2018-06-04 18:51:32 New "Stocks" app on Mac proves again that Apple cares only about rich motherfuckers, not regular people.
864 2018-06-04 18:51:32 News and Stocks. Apps that people don’t really use on their phones. So we brought it to the Mac! #WWDC18
865 2018-06-04 18:51:31 Stocks universal. News universal. Voice memos universal... everything universal? #marsepine #WWDC18
866 2018-06-04 18:51:29 Stocks auf dem Mac, das habe ich schon immer vermisst. Nicht. #WWDC2018
867 2018-06-04 18:51:29 Stocks! Everybody loves stocks.
868 2018-06-04 18:51:29 OMG stop trying to force the Stocks plugin as being something people want. #WWDC18
869 2018-06-04 18:51:28 I for one, am very excited about the Stocks App news at #WWDC2018
870 2018-06-04 18:51:27 The Stocks App is also coming to the mac with #macOSMojave
871 2018-06-04 18:51:27 I prefer to get long up stocks too.
872 2018-06-04 18:51:27 Apple News is finally coming to Mac (as leaked last week)! Stocks and Voice Memos coming, too, as mentioned earlier.
873 2018-06-04 18:51:27 Stocks app on the Mac, too, and Voice Memos (which integrates with GarageBand). And last but not least (thrilling @mikahsargent): The Home app. 

All these look identical to iOS 12.
874 2018-06-04 18:51:25 Again "Stocks" seems to cater to the 100K crowd.
875 2018-06-04 18:51:25 Wait do people actually use Stocks?
876 2018-06-04 18:51:24 macOS already has stocks as a widget, craig. Remember widgets?
877 2018-06-04 18:51:23 Stocks for the Mac FML #WWDC18
878 2018-06-04 18:51:22 In regard to apps through iOS Mojave, News, Stocks, and Voice Memos to the Mac system. #WWDC18
879 2018-06-04 18:51:22 Apple has talked more about the Stocks app today than it has at any other time in the 10-year history of the Stocks app
880 2018-06-04 18:51:22 More Stocks 
881 2018-06-04 18:51:22 STOCKS!!!!1111°!!11 #wwdc18
882 2018-06-04 18:51:21 News on the Mac has the same sidebar that’s being introduced on the iPad, with content otherwise the same as iOS. The Stocks app is also coming to the Mac, with Apple news integration.
883 2018-06-04 18:51:21 Yes, trend following & time series momentum is a divergent strategy. You momentum profits from divergence away from far value; the high MO stocks start fairly valued/overvalued and as returns get produced the overvaluation increases. It's why William O'Neil said to ignore P/E :)
884 2018-06-04 18:51:20 Stocks on Mac, and I thought WWDC couldn’t get any better.
885 2018-06-04 18:51:20 Stocks now included in macOS as well. Same Apple News integration as in iOS. #WWDC18
886 2018-06-04 18:51:20 man I BETTER be able to remove Stocks from the Mac #WWDC18

891 2018-06-04 18:51:16 stocks is the new courage
892 2018-06-04 18:51:16 #Stocks app coming to the mac, and with the new UI, it's actually a pretty sweet app. Can you buy stocks using it? Not yet. Soon. :) #WWDC18

915 2018-06-04 18:50:57 FINALLY STOCKS ON THE MAC.

916 2018-06-04 18:50:56 Apple will also be bringing Stocks to the Mac in Mojave. #WWDC18

923 2018-06-04 18:50:30 Uay!!! Stocks on Mac!!! Hope you can’t delete it.
924 2018-06-04 18:50:29 STOCKS

926 2018-06-04 18:50:19 You can scrub your stacks and your stocks!
927 2018-06-04 18:50:15 Yes, trend following & time series momentum is a divergent strategy. You momentum profits from divergence away from far value; the high MO stocks start fairly valued/overvalued and as returns get produced the overvaluation increases. It's why William O'Neil said to ignore P/E :)
928 2018-06-04 18:50:13 News and Stocks on the Mac - almost as exciting as news in the iOS stock app.
929 2018-06-04 18:50:03 Scanner company stocks  #WWDC2018
930 2018-06-04 18:49:39 Can't wait to see how high their stocks go during E3
931 2018-06-04 18:49:08 Trump is by far the best for our economy and anyone whos in stocks will tell you that. Jobs are great and getting better. However we need to work on housing market and college. Those 2 are still WAY too high!! Unaffordable in most places.
932 2018-06-04 18:49:00 I don't know who you're talking to but I feel trump will end up hurting everybody on earth with his stupid policies and childish bully tactics on everything. How about those great tax cuts! Has you paycheck doubled yet? I bet you're doing well on the stocks though.
933 2018-06-04 18:48:50 @realDonaldTrump   SUPREME CT. HAS RULED ASSAULT WEAPONS are NOT COVERED BY 2ND  Amendment!  Bump stocks make them ASSAULT RIFLES  HEAVY NRA $ LOBBYING ENDED 90'S BAN!

942 2018-06-04 18:45:41 the stocks that have had the biggest runs for the longest time...that's the process of getting over-owned

947 2018-06-04 18:42:57 Didn’t mind @Browndogg_30x suggestion of Mitch Wallis having a look at Gold Coast. Both are the type they desperately need to steel up their playing stocks.
948 2018-06-04 18:42:57 U.S markets rally behind technology stocks, after the iPhone maker kicked off its annual developers conference and windows software maker snagged a popular coding website

First lesson, don't tell me every penny change! If you want to sign up, let me know. We both get a free stock if you use my link.
955 2018-06-04 18:39:10 I always assumed that the stocks app was the one that went into the 'default stuff I never use' folder first.
956 2018-06-04 18:39:08 Really your worried about this. I was more interested in the amount of women taking the stage. Oh my god it’s scripted.  Oh Shit they spent time on News and stocks,  when they were actually demoing deeper integration. Get a grip.
957 2018-06-04 18:37:48 The reason Apple is worth $1 TRILLION is b/c OUR GOV made it possible for them to develop supply chains, exploit very poor people (and children) in other countries, buy back stocks, and NOT pay taxes. #Neoliberalism

980 2018-06-04 18:29:54 #Apple and #Microsoft led a rally in technology stocks on Monday, driving U.S. #stocks higher after the #iPhone maker kicked off its annual developer's conference and the #Windows software maker snagged a popular coding website.
981 2018-06-04 18:29:49 That stocks app though 
982 2018-06-04 18:29:27 Hey, coming from me, being considered Pink Sheets people should be regarded as a high accolade which they can tell their grandchildren about one day. Actually, Penny Stocks have a tremendous following among active investors in that grade of securities, and many wouldn't invest
983 2018-06-04 18:28:51 The thing is we ALL know of the manipulation, but how much can you keep tightening the spring before it pops out of control.  The more they crush metals, mining stocks, etc... the higher the returns when they do come loose
984 2018-06-04 18:28:43 Banning the Bump Stocks was up to Congress to make that bill. They did nothing! Our president only signs it into law. I wish people would quit blaming the NRA & our @POTUS ! The Dems especially are doing NOTHING! Except exposing themselves as corrupt & resistant to the good of US
985 2018-06-04 18:27:49 With the events and location data in the Photos apps, News in the Stocks app and even things like the Prode watch face “available at noon today”, Apple is becoming a services company in subtle ways. #WWDC2018
986 2018-06-04 18:27:43 If you take your i d of being a teacher in to hobby craft they will give you the bag while stocks last

988 2018-06-04 18:27:13 Best #WWDC18 ever! Hair jokes. Stocks app. Siri stuff. Tongues in Animoji. Hair jokes. Rebranded iBooks. Hair jokes. More exercise awards. Walkie Talkie. Siri stuff. Hair jokes. Podcast app. A Watch band. iTunes.
At least we get Google Maps in CarPlay.
989 2018-06-04 18:27:09 Ça reste très limité par rapport à d'habitude. Une refonte de l'app Stocks n'aurait jamais fait la keynote.
990 2018-06-04 18:27:04 If you are a genuine person, tell us where the constitution mentions bump stocks etc.
991 2018-06-04 18:26:51 Unless they sell stocks for their company, it is a private entity that offers goods or services to the public. They have the absolute right to refuse service to anyone they choose.
992 2018-06-04 18:26:37 Not one 2 step on toes but I’ve become a better trader with them so I will stand up for what’s right. It’s not for everyone, but if you don’t have the $ to trade, why join a service? They list all diff prices of stocks, So why negative to publicly because you have a small acct?
993 2018-06-04 18:26:21 $BABA at $209 right now.. Wow. #Stocks
994 2018-06-04 18:26:14 So still no third-party Apple Watch faces. But hey, the Stocks app got updated!
995 2018-06-04 18:26:14 Time to go long stocks of deodorant makers.  
996 2018-06-04 18:26:11 Answer is none even after a year and a half of hoping and praying from the left evidence President Trump has done anything Illegal still sits at ZERO. Evidence that President Trump has America in mind as President jobs, stocks, no forced medical, taxes and the best Dems hate him.
997 2018-06-04 18:26:05 Well yeah. Still boring. I was expecting some kind of redesigned icons or animations but all we're getting is a redesigned stocks app
998 2018-06-04 18:26:02 Who actually cares if their stocks are up or down? Who actually cares if their subscriptions are up or down? I mean seriously, WHO actually cares?! It's a matter of personal preference, and I personally prefer not to contribute to a company that will be promoting BO's communism.
999 2018-06-04 18:26:02 yeah but this year’s seems to be especially spaced out. i mean, giving keynote time to the fucking stocks app, seriously?
1000 2018-06-04 18:25:59 LEAF seems like a good buy if you like acb?  the proposed deal is for 3.575 acb stocks per medreleaf

AWOOOOOOOO
1002 2018-06-04 18:25:15 "small-cap stocks.. and leave alone for 10+ yrs". Nope, I got none.
1003 2018-06-04 18:25:15 Stocks holding on to their gains led by technology. Nvidia making a big jump to new highs. Up $7 today. $NVDA I think Citron told you to short this one... Someone buy @jimcramer dog a bone!
1004 2018-06-04 18:24:32 Stocks is where it’s at if you really serious about it 
1005 2018-06-04 18:24:21 I stopped watching. Nothing feels very innovative or exciting. Bringing stocks into the news app?

J'ai cet espoir moi aussi. Mais chez Boulanger(tout dépendra des stocks je suppose ou si ils décident de me le réparer) . Bon si c'est un V1 et qu'il fonctionne bien pas grave. 
1015 2018-06-04 18:20:55 Best time to buy stocks is during mass margin calls, like the one going on now due to ASM by exchanges and sebi. Those who can buy now would mint money soon. #MouthWateringValuations in many stocks.
1016 2018-06-04 18:20:52 Yeah like a boss! Weird deal all stocks no cash
1017 2018-06-04 18:20:19 Whoa! may be the first #stocks app update since the beginning of first iPhone! #WWDC2018 - Looks more like @robinhood web
1018 2018-06-04 18:20:01 We knowTrumps a chronic liar.  So let’s not be distracted. Puerto Rico 4500 hurricane related deaths no discussion.  Rhode Island has a new law banning bump stocks, 1500 kids missing due to new immigration policies
1019 2018-06-04 18:19:12 Guns and bump stocks aren’t the problem. You people just don’t get it do you.

1021 2018-06-04 18:19:02 the thing about #WWDC18 is that apple doesn't innovate anymore like they used to, everything is already done. i want something groundbreaking, not a "brand new stocks app".
1022 2018-06-04 18:18:44 Get yours whilst stocks last. Steven
1023 2018-06-04 18:18:42 Just wait entil lets go pikachu and lets go eevee comes out then stocks are gonna be big.
1024 2018-06-04 18:18:25 invest ..on dips?...in which STOCKS is da critical factor..
no point averaging down till >95% crash
1025 2018-06-04 18:18:18 Denver Police police last month invited city residents to turn in any bump stocks in their possession but Denverite reports that none have been handed over.
1026 2018-06-04 18:18:11 From what I'm seeing for the last couple of days I'd say the buying spree is over. Trending stocks may continue trending through the summer but it's getting increasingly difficult to buy anything on a breakout.
1027 2018-06-04 18:17:05 Ban bump stocks now. Thank you David for all you do 
1028 2018-06-04 18:16:22 yeah, they've added it to the stocks app
1029 2018-06-04 18:15:47 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1039 2018-06-04 18:11:12 Some investors have had their money tied up in #Nintendo #stocks for years (decades) and are the highest they have been for a while since #NintendoSwitch release. Some are just cashing out on there investment. More available stock on the open market = lower stock price.
1040 2018-06-04 18:10:53 News next to your stocks!

1042 2018-06-04 18:10:41 That's what the new stocks app is for I guess 
1043 2018-06-04 18:10:29 This is the most boring WWDC ever. seriously one of their top features for iOS 12 was the stocks app, seriously who the hell uses the stocks app anymore? It's one of the first things I delete if I ever had an iPhone.
1044 2018-06-04 18:10:07 It’s absolutely disheartening when I come across people in person and also on Social Media who share their “investment” stocks which I am sure they heard it from people without proper diligence. I try my level best to help them out but at times the losses are irreparable! #Sigh

1047 2018-06-04 18:08:34 Apple announces updates to stocks, news and FaceTime apps
1048 2018-06-04 18:07:11 My stocks rising
1049 2018-06-04 18:07:04 Till this day I did not realize that the Stocks app wasn't available on iPad. Which now seems like an absurdity.
1050 2018-06-04 18:06:43 
i didn't even know that there's stocks app
1051 2018-06-04 18:06:12 #ios12 rundown: better performance, search on Photos, Siri suggestions and shortcuts (including app), 3rd party nav apps on CarPlay, smart Do Not Disturb, grouped notifications, Screentime, Memoji, group FaceTime, and improvements on AR, News, Stocks and Voice Memos. #WWDC
1052 2018-06-04 18:06:11 My biggest problems are, playing in a big disadvantage state and closing stocks, but I counterpick a lot willys castle, I think that improving a wall game can give me some advantages, its no the "one thing that will make me win" but im sure it can help
1053 2018-06-04 18:06:10 Bump stocks don’t do shit
1054 2018-06-04 18:05:48 iOS 12 looks like a nice update. I hope their performance claims are true. I don't really care about Stocks/News etc, but group FaceTime is so nice.
1055 2018-06-04 18:05:43 There's many examples in US shark fisheries management.  E.g. genetics is one reason we manage some Gulf of Mexico stocks separately from Atlantic stocks of the same species.  Genetics is also heavily relied upon in Endangered Species Act evaluations.
1056 2018-06-04 18:05:03 How did they not port calculator to iPad tho but they ported Voice Memos and stocks?? lol

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.

1069 2018-06-04 17:59:16 Oh jong, ga nog wat wanken op je stocks app
1070 2018-06-04 17:58:44 NO to BUMP STOCKS!
1071 2018-06-04 17:58:28 I've dipped into the #AppleEvent twice now and so far I've seen how Apple are making the Stocks app available on the iPad for the first time and the introduction of memoji - truly groundbreaking stuff from Apple, and the audience are actually applauding this stuff #rollseyes
1072 2018-06-04 17:58:06 Nothing makes me feel stronger about tech stocks than being at the airport & seeing everyone on their iPhone looking at twitter, Facebook/IG or watching Netflix.

#wwdc18
1074 2018-06-04 17:56:43 FINALLY THE STOCKS APP IS UPDATED #WWDC
1075 2018-06-04 17:56:32 Yeah it’s probably about time. I thought they were going to give it the calculator along with Stocks and Voice Memos...
1076 2018-06-04 17:55:46 So where are the AR Memojis in Apple News in the Stocks app? #WWDC18
1077 2018-06-04 17:55:42 When i check stocks, yes but i do that rarely
1078 2018-06-04 17:55:40 Freckles are testing better than Apple News to Stocks.

1087 2018-06-04 17:54:32 4 + me and tongue and stocks app with news. What a great time to be alive.
1088 2018-06-04 17:54:03 Apple updates Stocks app to now include news, and an emoji that looks like you.

God, I miss Steve.
1089 2018-06-04 17:53:46 What is happening on stage with this information? Stocks, voice memos. Also, Craig needs his tongue to work. Mr Flubber McFlubberson up there
1090 2018-06-04 17:53:45 After seeing the animoji updates at #WWDC18 I am feeling sad that I said stocks app is not worthy.
1091 2018-06-04 17:53:39 * iOS 12 続き
** アプリ - News、Stocks(関連ニュースを表示, iPad対応)、Voice Memos(iPad対応)、Apple Books(iBooksから改名)、Car Play(3rd Partyナビゲーションアプリ対応)
1092 2018-06-04 17:53:31 Apple Stocks app packed with new features such as curated business news, and it is customized for a great iPad experience. Time for Avanza to build an iPad version?
1093 2018-06-04 17:53:29 I really wanna know what percentage of users use the stocks app though. So heh, do you people use it?
1094 2018-06-04 17:53:28 tl;dr of WWDC: news in stocks, and tongue detection
1095 2018-06-04 17:53:13 Stocks app with news, what will they think next. #WWDC18
1096 2018-06-04 17:53:02 The stocks app was the first thing I disabled when I got an iPhone.
1097 2018-06-04 17:52:59 Stocks, smocks. Meh. No one is clapping  #WWDC18
1098 2018-06-04 17:52:53 They’re finally adding the stocks app and the voice recorder to the iPad after all this time..   Be nice if they add a BLOODY CALCULATOR.  #iOS12
1099 2018-06-04 17:52:35 Yes market looking weak structure seeing only IT stocks performing tomorrow
1100 2018-06-04 17:52:32 I’m happy i didn’t had money to invest on their stocks. At least AR Sharing was cool 
1101 2018-06-04 17:52:14 Summary of today's event: "We've added grouped notifications" *glorious applause* "We've also added news articles to the stocks app" *glorious applause*
1102 2018-06-04 17:52:07 if you hold 100 stocks you are nuts
1103 2018-06-04 17:52:01 Has #Instagram ‘s value just plummeted as Apple have just shown them as public enemy number 1 of time wasting during the day? Wish I had a #Stocks app with real-time graphing ...!
1104 2018-06-04 17:50:44 Grouped notifications is a step in the right direction, but iOS notifications as a whole needs an overhaul. But at least this shows it is on Apple’s radar. Honestly though, this is poor marketing to bury it behind the Stocks app reveal.

1106 2018-06-04 17:50:36 This year’s #WWDC feels like what happens when @Apple Execs become middle-aged parents. 
Big announcements so far: Measure (modern day tape measure), Stocks (a redesign for adults), and now Screen Time (a way to track your kid’s phone usage).
1107 2018-06-04 17:50:29 When stocks  go onto the clouda it usually signals strong move ..is that what youve found with cloud base charting ?
1108 2018-06-04 17:50:03 Presentacion $APPL - Apple has finally updated its Stocks app with news headlines about stocks, but also integration with Apple News. The top stories in Stocks will be business news curated by the Apple News editors. The Stocks app will also be on iPad now.
1109 2018-06-04 17:49:56 Stocks on iPad? How about the instagram app on iPad? Group notifications? Shit! Apple all that new features seems like things that you should have had 5 years ago!  #WWDC18
1110 2018-06-04 17:49:33 I like to browse my Stocks app news while sipping my mint mojito, which is apparently a coffee drink and not a cocktail
1111 2018-06-04 17:49:29 'We're bringing news to stocks' cue whoops and cheers ..... :)
1112 2018-06-04 17:49:19 TIL Stocks app didn’t support iPad.
1113 2018-06-04 17:49:16 And stocks! Don't forget stocks :)
1114 2018-06-04 17:49:15 2018 - Apple brings stocks to iPad

1117 2018-06-04 17:48:52 U.S. stocks climbed led by gains in technology shares and  Friday's robust jobs data, which gave investors heightened confidence that the U.S. economy remained strong

1118 2018-06-04 17:48:35 What do you mean by "used?"

When the iPhone was brand new and I could first try it out in the stores, I opened the app and saw that, yeah, you can look up stocks on it.

Nothing since then though.
1119 2018-06-04 17:48:33 Including News to Stocks, entirely new Stocks app (also on iPad), voice memos on iPad, and redesigned Apple Books app.
1120 2018-06-04 17:48:30 And the Stocks app to iPAD!!!!!!!!!


1121 2018-06-04 17:48:18 Dude stocks are the best
1122 2018-06-04 17:48:09 Now Apple launches features to make us stop using that Stocks app less obsessively
1123 2018-06-04 17:48:09 This is painful. Trying to sell Stocks and Voice Memo as cool apps. And then finger guns on exit?!? #WWDC18
1124 2018-06-04 17:48:00 Catching stocks on their good runs is like catching Pokémon....that can destroy you in moments at any time if you don’t watch them constantly. They also laugh in your face when they eat your money.
1125 2018-06-04 17:47:59 technically this is stocks 3 since we had stocks 2 after the great depression
1126 2018-06-04 17:47:58 Stocks plus News = Snooze. #WWDC18
1127 2018-06-04 17:47:40 #WWDC2018 

'We've completely rebuilt the stocks app from the ground up"

What that app no one uses?
1128 2018-06-04 17:47:34 In all seriousness... maybe this was a low-hanging fruit test for the "universal app framework"? Rewrite stocks & voice memos first on the new framework, graduate to Health, Home, etc later?
1129 2018-06-04 17:47:32 When I saw the stocks app will get an update I thought you’ll support trading within the app, or at least integrating third party trading apps #WWDC2018
1130 2018-06-04 17:47:29 Ugh, I'm going to have to delete the stocks app again.
1131 2018-06-04 17:47:28 did they announce the sequel to stocks at wwdc? we've been waiting over 40 years for a sequel...
1132 2018-06-04 17:47:28 That’s why there were no leaks. Who the hell would leak info about Stocks and Voice Memos? #WWDC
1133 2018-06-04 17:47:28 Every rumor has been right so far, DND getting upgraded, improvements to stocks, 5s getting iOS 12, etc etc
1134 2018-06-04 17:47:21 Cool, so there is new stocks app, but still no native calculator and weather app for iPad?  #WWDC18
1135 2018-06-04 17:47:17 Apple has teams of programmers working on AR and iOS updates.

And in a closet somewhere updating the News and Stocks app is Susan. 

#WWDC #WWDC18 #PoorSusan
1136 2018-06-04 17:47:15 My favorite part of Apple tech coverage is when they announce something that I care about and tech journalists obviously don’t. Like, I use the stocks app, but have never needed to set multiple timers by voice in my life.
1137 2018-06-04 17:47:14 Wtf @Apple, nothing new? Stocks app, really?
1138 2018-06-04 17:47:08 Gotta have your daily stocks!!
1139 2018-06-04 17:47:08 Buy some stocks, more fun that way. 
1140 2018-06-04 17:47:06 They introduced regular shit. Reminder to wish grandma happy bday... do not disturb during bed time... photos like google photos... news tab in your stocks app.. just very regular
1141 2018-06-04 17:47:06 Everyone: iOS is broken
Apple: sToCks aPp is nOw oN iPad
#WWDC18
1142 2018-06-04 17:46:58 Curious if the new Stocks app presented at #WWDC18 will support Bitcoin, and wich exchange will be used as reference for BTC price
1143 2018-06-04 17:46:50 Smaraju sa Books, Stocks i News aplikacijama…WHOOOOO CARESSS!!??? #AppleWWDC2018
1144 2018-06-04 17:46:43 Stocks debería ser parte de News, pero supongo que como News no llega a todos los dispositivos, bueno. Hubiese sido una mejor noticia #WWDC18
1145 2018-06-04 17:46:34 Okay all these iOS 12 "app-dates" like calc for ipad, stocks for ipad seem like they are picked up from Apple's Jira backlog lol $AAPL
1146 2018-06-04 17:46:31 okay idk how much people care about the stocks feature on ios devices but i love having it on my phone
Glad its been revamped
1147 2018-06-04 17:46:30 "We're now adding news to the stocks app." You guys should have just announced that in the News app so I could more easily ignore it
1148 2018-06-04 17:46:30 Each year feels more brutal watching #Apple #WWDC18. When do we get something that wows us? All gimmicks that nobody will use. Appreciate speed boosts but I don't need long winded "we're bringing STOCKS TO IPAD OHMYGOD YES LIFE CHANGING!" announcements. #iOS12
1149 2018-06-04 17:46:26 omg  ios12 is finally going to bring  thE STOCKS APP  TO THE IPAD  WOWZA 
1150 2018-06-04 17:46:26 Here's the issue with iOS 12, they've spent that past 20 minutes talking about updates to built-in apps that I haven't used in years. 

Just let us set default apps and leave us alone. No one cares about the Stocks app.
1151 2018-06-04 17:46:15 Including News to Stocks, entirely new Stocks app (also on iPad), voice memos on iPad, and redesigned Apple Books app.
#wwdc2018 #appleinsider
1152 2018-06-04 17:46:14 Uh @Apple voice memos and stocks is great on the iPad, but what about the weather and calculator app?! Cmon!!!
1153 2018-06-04 17:46:11 "we put news into stocks!"
1154 2018-06-04 17:46:05 Yay, I can ignore the Stocks app on multiple devices #WWDC18
1155 2018-06-04 17:46:03 I don’t know why they even bother offering one. Anyone interested in stocks will just download a better alternative.
1156 2018-06-04 17:46:02 Stocks for Carplay!
1157 2018-06-04 17:46:01 O SHIT NEW STOCKS APP
1158 2018-06-04 17:46:00 Seriously Apple... Stocks, Voice Memos updates in the Keynote?
1159 2018-06-04 17:45:54 "We've completely redone the stocks app."
"We're bringing Apple News to stocks." 

Why is this at a keynote of a developer conference? As a developer, there's nothing to integrate with here. #WWDC18
1160 2018-06-04 17:45:53 Do not listen to the voices! Too late. The post-hypotic suggestions are already embedded. Tim Cook says you will buy a new iPhone. And use the stocks app.
1161 2018-06-04 17:45:52 no one cares about stocks, memos, or apple books . give us some shit we want like 3way FaceTime & shit like that . important stuff #WWDC18
1162 2018-06-04 17:45:51 Stocks aufm iPad! Nach all den Jahren kann ich endlich beruhigt schlafen! ER-MAH-GERD! 
1163 2018-06-04 17:45:49 Stocks had a light and dark skin 
1164 2018-06-04 17:45:49 iOS12: "Our top feature for the stock app: We're bringing the news app to the stocks app" #wwdc18 

iOS13: 
"We're bringing the Weather app to the Books app, 
the Reminders app to the Calculator app, 
and the TV app to the Notes app."
1165 2018-06-04 17:45:49 Apple News currating business headlines in the Stocks app... could they actively curate news that benefits them in the stock market? #WWDC18
1166 2018-06-04 17:45:48 YES!!! Socks are coming to iPad! Oh...you said STOCKS. Meh. #wwdc18
1167 2018-06-04 17:45:46 #WWDC18 --> "Stocks App!!!"
1168 2018-06-04 17:45:45 nobody cares about the stocks app
1169 2018-06-04 17:45:45 Apple's annual developer conference is taking place tonight. We're getting close to 45 minutes in and it's been tedious.

Exciting news: Apple News now has stocks built in. Oh, and Voice Memos are being introduced to the iPad for the first time
1170 2018-06-04 17:45:44 Huge pause for stocks update, but the REAL news is 3rd party apps on carplay #WWDC18
1171 2018-06-04 17:45:43 "Happy to announce... Apple News being added to.... Stocks!"   #ConfusedApplause Huh?  "...and Stocks to iPad!"  #PickingUpPitchforks
1172 2018-06-04 17:45:43 @mathowie You know, I'd love a good long piece about the mystery that is Stocks
1173 2018-06-04 17:45:42 Apple news update slightly, voice memos comes to iPads, stocks app receives news, iBooks gets changed to Apple books with a cleaner design! Refinements! #WWDC2018
1174 2018-06-04 17:45:39 I think it is very confusing that they are announcing a new version of Stocks when they are also heavily rumored to announce their new farming app Stalks.
1175 2018-06-04 17:45:39 Why would iPads not have Stocks. As someone pointed out, why would Apple feature an app that most people delete?
1176 2018-06-04 17:45:38 You think Trump won’t pardon himself because he said so?  He also said he'd release his tax returns and ban bump stocks among a million other things.  Trump is a con man.
1177 2018-06-04 17:45:38 That one dude who uses Stocks must be losing it right now #WWDC18
1178 2018-06-04 17:45:37 News, Stocks, Books, Carplay. 
You know, appdates. 
#WWDC18
1179 2018-06-04 17:45:37 Ok ok so Apple decided to update their 2 shitty apps (news and stocks) so people might now use it. APPLE REALLY  IOS 12 is going to suck and look like iOS 11 Good Job 
1180 2018-06-04 17:45:36 Interesting to see a bunch of iPad-specific app updates (e.g. Stocks and News)
1181 2018-06-04 17:45:35 I hope I’m never enough of an adult to clap for a stocks app. #WDCD2018
1182 2018-06-04 17:45:35 Who the fuck uses the Stocks app? Boooo #WWDC2018
1183 2018-06-04 17:45:35 No one in that room cares about the stocks app
1184 2018-06-04 17:45:34 Stocks in iPad but still no Calculator? #WWDC18
1185 2018-06-04 17:45:31 News: side bar/ Stocks:applenews, with after prices?/ Voicememo:available for ipad/ Books:??
1186 2018-06-04 17:45:31 With News featured in the Stocks App, Apple announces that they finally implement functionality Robinhood has already had. #WWDC
1187 2018-06-04 17:45:30 How did stocks and voice memos each get more stage time than 3rd party navigation apps in Car Play?
1188 2018-06-04 17:45:28 #WWDC18 - NEWS IN STOCKS - THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!
1189 2018-06-04 17:45:28 Apple, it took you 8 years to bring the stocks and voice memos apps on iPad..let's wait 8 more so that you can bring the weather app #wwdc18
1190 2018-06-04 17:45:26 Voice Memos and Stocks apps has come to the iPad. Apple Books has replaced iBooks w/more options in iOS12. #WWDC2018 #iOS12
1191 2018-06-04 17:45:26 The only person I know that would care about the updates to the Stocks app is @BobbyBruce12
1192 2018-06-04 17:45:24 But still no Weather, which you’d think is more widely used than stocks and voice memo!
1193 2018-06-04 17:45:24 No te digo en el póquer
1194 2018-06-04 17:45:22 Google I/O: Our robots will call people to schedule things for you

WWDC: After 8 long years Stocks and Memo finally exist for the iPad (AND we dropped the i off iBooks)
1195 2018-06-04 17:45:21 Wow iBooks, voice memos, stocks AND Apple News!!!! Great apps to update!!!...I didn’t even know they still existed #WWDC2018
1196 2018-06-04 17:45:21 Make sure to check out the new additions to the Stocks App if you have any investments! It’ll now make it easy to see relevant business news, relevant headlines, and full articles without leaving the app. #WWDC18 #AppleEvent #LakertechTakeover
1197 2018-06-04 17:45:21 In either case... you know it's a slow year when the Stocks app is considered news.

(although... Workflow integrated into Siri?!! *wow*)
1198 2018-06-04 17:45:19 WHY ARE THEY SO OBSESSED WITH STOCKS?!
1199 2018-06-04 17:45:17 Susan has to be the single worst presenter Apple has ever put on stage. Apple News for Stocks? Stocks for iPad? Geebus.
1200 2018-06-04 17:45:15 Bueno, siempre algo no es necesario, como Stocks.
#WWDC18
1201 2018-06-04 17:45:14 With Stocks and Voice Memos coming to the iPad, now all we need is a calculator app. #WWDC18
1202 2018-06-04 17:45:13 Puff tendré que desempolvar la app de finanzas (stocks) para leer las noticias.
1203 2018-06-04 17:45:13 ..but you've been able to delete Stocks for a while now..
1204 2018-06-04 17:45:12 cant wait to dive into the new stocks app! #WWDC
1205 2018-06-04 17:45:11 Stocks war glaub ich vorher schon auf dem iPad, nur nicht in der news App, die Sprachmemos sind neu auf dem iPad
1206 2018-06-04 17:45:10 “Apple News integrated with Stocks WOW” Well I guess they had to fill the cut homescreen revamp with something…
1207 2018-06-04 17:45:10 But they’re bringing Apple News to Stocks!!!
#TwoUselessThingsAreUselessTogether
1208 2018-06-04 17:45:09 I'm deleting the stocks app as soon as I update my shit #WWDC2018
1209 2018-06-04 17:45:09 Voice memos? Stocks? Apple books?? Who the hell uses these apps? Do something useful apple! Stop giving updates on useless apps that nobody uses. #WWDC2018
1210 2018-06-04 17:45:09 Voice Memory, Stocks.. Apple muss wirklich wenig auf dem Zettel haben #Keynote #wwdc18
1211 2018-06-04 17:45:07 The ability to use third-party apps in CarPlay got more applause than did the first-party Stocks app.
1212 2018-06-04 17:45:07 Stocks…Voice Memo. Everyone’s favourite apps as well?
1213 2018-06-04 17:45:06 Yay Stocks app is now available to delete from the iPad #WWDC18
1214 2018-06-04 17:45:05 mmmmmmmm lemme check stocks in the cAR MMMM YES #wwdc18
1215 2018-06-04 17:45:04 Bump stocks? You can have the same effect using a goddamn belt loop.
1216 2018-06-04 17:45:03 #US Stocks: Pharma $BMY-4.3%.Cosmetics $ULTA+4%.App S/w $SNAP +4.4%Railway $UNP-2.6%.Hotel $WYNN-5.5%.Online Svc $TTD-5.5%.Solar $FSLR-6.8%.Tech $NXP-2.9%.BFS $IBKR-3.9% $MA+1%.HomeWares $WSM +7%.Info/Payment Mgmt $WEX+4.9%.Energy $BHGE-6.1%.SportsWear $UAA +5.2%.Retail $TGT+4.6%
1217 2018-06-04 17:45:03 Finally after 8 years iPad is getting stocks app and voice recording app.
1218 2018-06-04 17:45:02 So stocks and voice memos are coming to the iPad but still no calculator? #WWDC2018
1219 2018-06-04 17:45:01 Apple news in stocks
Stocks to iPad in ios12
#WWDC18
1220 2018-06-04 17:45:01 And I see it so often where highly rated Growth Stocks tend to get Analyst Upgrades which means they are often a lot cheaper than they appear. A mix of different Stocks perhaps a fair compromise.
1221 2018-06-04 17:45:00 iPad 上拥有 Stocks 应用了。。。。 iPad 上有语音备忘录应用了。。。。
1222 2018-06-04 17:44:59 Hej apple when are you going to make a dark mode?

Apple: LOOK AT OUR NEW STOCKS APP.
1223 2018-06-04 17:44:59 Wow the Stocks app in #iOS12 is incredible. Integration with News, iPad support...terrific #WWDC18
1224 2018-06-04 17:44:59 Stocks … there MUST be someone out there dying for an enhanced Stocks app, right? 

I’d be happy to never hear of/see the Stocks app ever again.
#WWDC18
1225 2018-06-04 17:44:57 News in stocks, Stocks in iPads, Voice Memo in iPad and iBooks changed to Apple Books. Nothing interesting here. #WWDC2018
1226 2018-06-04 17:44:57 BREAKING! Stocks coming to iPad! Great, now I have another app to delete on my tablet! #WWDC18
1227 2018-06-04 17:44:57 I loaded up Tweetdeck just as soon as the bit about Stocks appeared, hoping to see some Richard Cobbett Snark. Not disappointed!
1228 2018-06-04 17:44:56 I frequently use the Stocks app and haven't particularly been fond of the news bit of it so it's exciting to hear the update to it. Plus adding it to the iPad is key. #WWDC18
1229 2018-06-04 17:44:56 nobody give af about no stocks
1230 2018-06-04 17:44:56 Path of the Patriots 2018. Scholars in the stocks.
1231 2018-06-04 17:44:55 Robinhood has no worries at all.  I've yet to see any reason to use the native stocks app.  Robinhood has better stocks info and you can buy sell, not just see on a poorly done (but now updated) interface
1232 2018-06-04 17:44:55 About time they bring the Stocks app to the iPad. Now can they bring the Calculator app to the iPad also.  #wwdc #WWDC2018 #WWDC18 #appleevent #applekeynote
1233 2018-06-04 17:44:55 No multi-user support, but hey, I can use the Stocks app on my iPad! Wohoo. #WWDC18
1234 2018-06-04 17:44:54 I have never wanted a stocks app.
1235 2018-06-04 17:44:54 8 years late. But Stocks app is finally coming to iPad in #iOS12.
1236 2018-06-04 17:44:52 WOOHOO, Apple News and Stocks, together, in the one app. 

(Caution, tweet may contain sarcasm)
1237 2018-06-04 17:44:51 I’m still trying to figure out if anyone who owns stocks actually uses Apple Stocks.
1238 2018-06-04 17:44:51 Revampt stocks app... crypto integration would be great but hey, they added another news tab #wwdc
1239 2018-06-04 17:44:49 There is nothing in the Constitution that addresses what age a person has to be in order to purchase guns, therefore raising the age is not a violation of the Constitution.  Bump stocks are not covered under the 2nd Amendment.  Therefore, there would be no violation of rights.
1240 2018-06-04 17:44:49 Stocks app, voice memos for Apple iPad meh #wwdc18 #notimpressive
1241 2018-06-04 17:44:48 You can tell when only the Apple employees are applauding. The first hint is that anyone is applauding Apple News, Stocks, Voice Memos or anything to do with iBooks.
1242 2018-06-04 17:44:48 Voice memos, weather, and stocks feels like a Jeb Bush “please clap” moment
1243 2018-06-04 17:44:48 Susan is way too hyped about Stocks, Voice Memos, and Apple Books.
1244 2018-06-04 17:44:47 Yo, #WWDC18 is the funniest thing in the world right now. Stocks on iPad. Wow!
1245 2018-06-04 17:44:47 Ok, voice memos and stocks are coming to the iPad. How about the CALCULATOR APP APPLE?!
1246 2018-06-04 17:44:47 stocks app… only thing to make it even more boring
1247 2018-06-04 17:44:45 I haven't looked at the Apple Stocks app in years. Anyone else?
1248 2018-06-04 17:44:45 Has anyone still got Stocks or Audio Recorder installed.

Also… we dropped the “i”.
1249 2018-06-04 17:44:45 The day @Apple decides to announce the addition of #Bitcoin as a default to their Stocks app @wwdc is going to be so much fun.
1250 2018-06-04 17:44:42 Mejoras en las apps “news” mejoras en “stocks” y cambia a “appleBooks” con mejoras para audiolibros #ios12 #appleEvent
1251 2018-06-04 17:44:42 I think the Stocks app integrating with News, it’s somewhat like forcing something into a different realm #wwdc2018 #ios12 #ios
1252 2018-06-04 17:44:42 Und wahrscheinlich benutzen mehr Leute die Stocks App als wir wahrhaben wollen...
1253 2018-06-04 17:44:41 I can't wait for 2000 words on the new Stocks app!
1254 2018-06-04 17:44:41 Lots of attention paid to the Stocks app even though I don’t know anybody else who uses it. ^^;
1255 2018-06-04 17:44:41 Penso che la prima e unica volta che ho aperto #Stocks (Borsa), si chiamava ancora iPhone OS...  La vecchia e cara 1.1.4  #WWDC18
1256 2018-06-04 17:44:41 Stoked about the redesigned Stocks app. It’s always been one of mine and @Pun_Dog faves. #WWDC2018
1257 2018-06-04 17:44:40 Apple seeming kinda tone-deaf by spotlighting "Stocks" forgetting that's the number one app most people wanted to hide from view on their phone.  #WWDC18
1258 2018-06-04 17:44:40 Elon Musk: Lets go to Mars!

Apple: We are bringing news to the stocks app! So excited. 

#WWDC
1259 2018-06-04 17:44:40 ¡OMG! Actualizaron la app de Stocks de Apple, justo lo que tanto deseabamos.

-Nadie, ni Tim Cook #WWDC18
1260 2018-06-04 17:44:39 #Apple keynote #WWDC18: stocks, voice memo, books...the updates that happen that no one cares about
1261 2018-06-04 17:44:39 Stop talking about stocks and voice memos and continue talking more about the Siri changes! #WWDC
1262 2018-06-04 17:44:38 Voice App. Stocks. Die App, die ich am öftesten nutze. Definitiv.  #wwdc18
1263 2018-06-04 17:44:36 "we've finally added apple news to stocks!"

#WWDC18: *muted claps*

@AltConference: xD THE FEATURE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR

AltConf was a good decision.
1264 2018-06-04 17:44:36 Any uncertainty in the supply chain – such as the amplified variation of demand seen in
the last example – encourages organisations to hold higher stocks to give themselves a margin
of safety. #Vanig prevents this by bring in patented #blockchain technology!
1265 2018-06-04 17:44:34 Some things with these apps I'm questioning...  Like the drop of the "i" in "iBooks" and including news in the Stocks apps... #WWDC2018
1266 2018-06-04 17:44:32 Uh oh, they brought stocks and voice memo to iPad, That could mean that they’re bringing calculator to the iPad too… let’s hope not for @jamesthomson’s sake.
1267 2018-06-04 17:44:32 Hey Siri, show my some Apple News in Stocks.
#kurwa
1268 2018-06-04 17:44:32 Why  not? They have brought Apple News to Stocks.. and Stocks is coming to Ipad as well.. 
1269 2018-06-04 17:44:31 Stocks app and voice memos coming to iPad in iOS 12. #WWDC18
1270 2018-06-04 17:44:31 Stocks on iPad finally
1271 2018-06-04 17:44:30 Does the fact that people actually clapped for adding News to Stocks say more about the kind of people who attend the Keynote, or how rich the old guard at Apple have become?
1272 2018-06-04 17:44:29 Stocks. The most pointless iOS app ever….
1273 2018-06-04 17:44:29 We: Hey #apple, we’d really love a dark mode in iOS.
Apple: sure, here’s Apple news in the stocks app!

#WWDC18 #WWDC
1274 2018-06-04 17:44:28 Who cares about stocks on iOS 12 
1275 2018-06-04 17:44:28 I can finally use the stocks app on my iPad
1276 2018-06-04 17:44:26 *watching demo for Stocks in iOS12*


1277 2018-06-04 17:44:26 Stocks on iPad? Nice but we already have Bloomberg @business #WWDC2018
1278 2018-06-04 17:44:26 Sure bring stocks and voice memos to iPad. WHERES THE CALCULATOR APP APPLE. APPLE EXPLAIN.
1279 2018-06-04 17:44:26 The Stocks app looks like it is built for the apple executives who have scrooge mcduck levels of cash #WWDC2018
1280 2018-06-04 17:44:25 All well and good bringing Stocks, voice memos to the iPad but where's my calculator??? #WWDC18
1281 2018-06-04 17:44:25 Stocks to iPad where is should have been.
Can the calculator go to the iPad too

#WWDC18
1282 2018-06-04 17:44:25 Oh cool, there will be an all new iOS stocks app for me to put straight in the bin.
1283 2018-06-04 17:44:24 Apple News x Stocks. The most ambitious crossover in history.
1284 2018-06-04 17:44:23 What, a stocks app update isn't enough for you Mark?
1285 2018-06-04 17:44:23 10 Years later APPLE REDESIGNS THE STOCKS APP THAT STILL NOBODY WILL USE BUT NOW ITS JUST PRETTY
1286 2018-06-04 17:44:23 Ready for it.... we integrated Apple news into Stocks!  omggg. I’ve deleted both apps on my iPhone already. #WWDC18
1287 2018-06-04 17:44:21 Presenter ... We've brought Apple News to Stocks
Me ...   
#WWDC18
1288 2018-06-04 17:44:21 Can now view News and Stocks AT THE SAME TIME. So hyped!!!!!!
1289 2018-06-04 17:44:20 Google redesigns news at i/o 18, Apple tweaks news and adds it to Stocks #WWDC18
1290 2018-06-04 17:44:20 With iOS 12 the Stocks & Voice memo apps come to iPad and get updated #iOS12 #WWDC2018
1291 2018-06-04 17:44:20 Oh my god I did not think it could get worse than talking about cameras and photo apps but it has. Stocks really… goodnight
1292 2018-06-04 17:44:20 Finally Apple creates its own News app. Also beefing up stocks app for first time maybe ever. #wwdc2018
1293 2018-06-04 17:44:20 It's fun to consider who the target demo is for any of these software features. For example, I am not the target demo for Stocks. #wwdc18
1294 2018-06-04 17:44:19 Talking about Stocks and Voice Memos…Thin lineup this year. #WWDC18
1295 2018-06-04 17:44:18 OK wait... did Susan just say that if you click on a headline in Stocks you can read the story without leaving the app? 
 #wwdc18
1296 2018-06-04 17:44:17 Apple stocks is now just as useful as yahoo finance was 10 years ago.
1297 2018-06-04 17:44:16 Stocks am iPad. Gut, wieder was zum sofort löschen.
1298 2018-06-04 17:44:16 Boggles my mind the things that are getting rapacious applause on stage. Stocks for iPad, Voice Memo. Amazing. #wwdc18
1299 2018-06-04 17:44:15 yea stocks are more important than a calculator on the ipad
1300 2018-06-04 17:44:15 Finally, Stocks comes to the iPad. Thank you, @Apple for the highlight of my day.
1301 2018-06-04 17:44:15 New stocks app? Not like we haven’t needed one of those for the past 4 ios’s. #WWDC18
1302 2018-06-04 17:44:14 What's less exciting than updating the Stocks app? Renaming iBooks to "Apple Books."
1303 2018-06-04 17:44:14 I know - stocks on the iPad; crazy, right?
1304 2018-06-04 17:44:14 #WWDC2018 app updates - News, Stocks, Apple News now in Stocks; Stocks on iPad; Voicemail reworked and on iPad - Voicemail with iCloud support. IBooks enhanced and now called Apple Books.
1305 2018-06-04 17:44:14 I was just thinking having #crypto in stocks would be cooler than news.
1306 2018-06-04 17:44:13 "And we're excited to announce that we're bringing News to Stocks". At least we didn't hear a "Wooohhooo" in the crowd. #wwdc18
1307 2018-06-04 17:44:13 "We are so excited to announce that we are bringing Apple News to stocks".... Apple has had news headlines in the Stocks app for years, just it would open Safari when you clicked on it. Nothing major here. #WWDC18
1308 2018-06-04 17:44:12 Stocks is getting a redesign with News integration!!

#WWDC2018
1309 2018-06-04 17:44:12 Voice memos, new Stocks app,  coming to iPad in iOS 12
-Susan #WWDC18
1310 2018-06-04 17:44:11 wow wait iPad has no calculator, voice memos, stocks?  #WWDC18
1311 2018-06-04 17:44:11 Stocks, years ago. Ironic they are so proud of this, since it is the app I always want to hide/delete ASAP. :-) #WWDC18
1312 2018-06-04 17:44:11 Apple News x Stocks. The most ambitious crossover in history.
1313 2018-06-04 17:44:11  Voice memos on iPad
 Redesigned Stocks app
[  ]  Multiple timers 

credit to @ismh for this
1314 2018-06-04 17:44:10 Echt jetzt? Wegen der Kombination von "News" und "Stocks" ist sie "excited" oh man, soviel zu den ganzen Nachrichten-Gerüchten...
Oh und einige iPhone Apps kommen jetzt auch endlich auf das iPad. 
Und dann heißt iBooks nur noch Books. #Gähn #wwdc18
1315 2018-06-04 17:44:09 [PH] BREAKING: Apple is bringing news directly into the stocks app. #Courage #WWDC
1316 2018-06-04 17:44:09 Hahaha, only the first 5 center rows are clapping. No one in the left and right blocks is clapping during the Stocks and News updates. #WWDC18
1317 2018-06-04 17:44:09 They’re demoing the stocks app at WWDC? I guess it’s kind of a big deal that the iPad is *finally* getting some basic features that the iPhone has had since day one. 
1318 2018-06-04 17:44:09 I was hoping Apple would kill the Stocks app, actually.
1319 2018-06-04 17:44:08 Ahhhh yes the person who has to get the latest up-to-date stocks news, but doesn’t use the app for their financial institution they you know, manage their stocks with.
1320 2018-06-04 17:44:08 Weißt du ich hab mich nie mit APple groß beschäftigt und schau gerade seit keine ahnung 5 minuten und denk mir so: WARUM IS DAS NEU??? Stocks aufm iPad, Sprachmemos aufm iPad, Navigation in den News? WAT
1321 2018-06-04 17:44:08 But, can we finally delete the Stocks app? “We’re now bringing this undeletable app to the iPad!” #WWDC18
1322 2018-06-04 17:44:08 Apple News in stocks, curated by editors at #Apple, looks interesting. #WWDC18
1323 2018-06-04 17:44:08 The world's richest company is excited about combining news information into the stocks app?! #WWDC2018
1324 2018-06-04 17:44:08 Wow. Apple finally learned to port basic iPhone functions to the iPad, like stocks and voice memos. Took them only 8 years. Bravo. Wen eta calculator for pad #WWDC18
1325 2018-06-04 17:44:07 Only at Apple's developer conference could you get whoops and hollers from the audience for a line like, "now, with iOS 12 <dramatic pause>, we're bringing Stocks to iPad"...
1326 2018-06-04 17:44:06 I didn’t even know the stocks app wasn’t on iPad, that’s how useless it is lmao.

#WWDC18
1327 2018-06-04 17:44:06 watching the Apple thing and people just applauded an update to the Stocks app.

you might know the Stocks app from your folder called Can’t Delete or 
1328 2018-06-04 17:44:05 She has a way too much enthusiasm forthe voice memos and stocks apps #WWDC18
1329 2018-06-04 17:44:05 Stocks on iPad!! What I always wanted. Maybe next year, a calculator?
1330 2018-06-04 17:44:04 BREAKING: My retirement portfolio didn't get fully funded but I will love reading more about what I should've done with the new Stocks app. #WWDC18
1331 2018-06-04 17:44:04 Apple pretending anyone cares about the Stocks app is hilarious, I think this is the first time I've heard a sympathy clap during WWDC.
1332 2018-06-04 17:44:03 And brought stocks to iPad (finally!)
1333 2018-06-04 17:44:03 Stocks on the iPad. Another App to hide to give you practice on hiding apps.
1334 2018-06-04 17:44:02 Updates to built in apps that take up room on your iPhone.  Apple News to Stocks?! Zzzzzz. #WWDC18
1335 2018-06-04 17:44:02 “We’ve updated Stocks!” *opens redesigned app, sees Apple’s stock explode through the top of phone* #WWDC
1336 2018-06-04 17:44:02 Stocks and Voice Memos ported to iPad, but still no calculator. 
1337 2018-06-04 17:44:02 I bet this audience doesn’t care about stocks…

#WWDC18
1338 2018-06-04 17:44:02 I am way too excited about the stocks app being updated because I am an old man and what has become of me.
1339 2018-06-04 17:44:02 “We’re bringing Apple news to Stocks”

Developers fall asleep. Who immediately uninstalled the Stocks app? Does anybody care? #WWDC18
1340 2018-06-04 17:44:01 I’ll still delete Stocks and News apps. I truly couldn’t care less about their updates.
1341 2018-06-04 17:44:01 Stocks is one of those iOS apps that I wonder why they felt the need to build it into the OS
1342 2018-06-04 17:44:01 So bored…. no one gives a shit about stocks. I typically delete it
1343 2018-06-04 17:44:00 “With iOS 12 we’re bringing ‘Stocks’ to iPad!” Wow! Breaking new ground here folks.
1344 2018-06-04 17:43:59 Does anyone in my timeline know anyone who's using the stocks app from #iOS? #WWDC2018
1345 2018-06-04 17:43:59 There is only big tech company's stocks app that was ever good and it was Google Finance and even that wasn't super great and I don't even know if it exists anymore.

Apple, Google, Microsoft, I give you permission to stop. It's okay. Anyone who cares already has better apps.
1346 2018-06-04 17:43:58 yoooooooooo stock graphs! apple news in stocks! measurement apps! Woo woo woo woo
1347 2018-06-04 17:43:58 Apple News ook in de app Stocks met zakennieuws
1348 2018-06-04 17:43:58 No one will be seating during the exciting iOS12 stocks and news updates portion of #WWDC2018.
1349 2018-06-04 17:43:58 “We’re brining the stocks app to the iPad!” Ummmmm yea, because I REALLY used it when it was on my iPhone.. #WWDC #wwdcfail
1350 2018-06-04 17:43:57 I’ve got to assume that iOS12 is basically “Snow 11” as the new features (Stocks on iPad getting keynote time?) #wwdc
1351 2018-06-04 17:43:56 Real talk, how many people actually use stocks apps? And voice notes? Gosh, I'm falling asleep here #WWDC18
1352 2018-06-04 17:43:56 Wait, Stocks wasn’t on the iPad? Who knew? Who cared?
1353 2018-06-04 17:43:55 I rock with Apple but they have some of the most basic announcements lol. “We’re bringing Stocks to iPad”. Something that should’ve been there but nobody will use
1354 2018-06-04 17:43:55 Apple have updated the Stocks app. That’s made my day I can tell you.
1355 2018-06-04 17:43:54 Stocks on iPad. Should we really cheer for something that should have been there years ago?
1356 2018-06-04 17:43:53 Can’t wait to still delete the stocks app form my phone lol
1357 2018-06-04 17:43:53 Apple news in the stocks app? Oh, boy!!!

Stocks on iPad too? What a keynote!!!

JFC, Apple is incredibly out of touch.
1358 2018-06-04 17:43:53 To improve the stocks app, instead of adding any real feature, we have merged it with News #WWDC
1359 2018-06-04 17:43:53 Okay, stocks and voice memos on iPad but where’s calculator and weather?
1360 2018-06-04 17:43:53 STOCKS ON IPAD!!!! #WWDC2018
1361 2018-06-04 17:43:52 #WWDC18 seriously, by talking about stocks and news app, Apple is saying they have got jack shit left to show in iOS12.
1362 2018-06-04 17:43:52 I wonder if Edward Tufte knows they're using his sparklines in the updated Stocks app? #WWDC18
1363 2018-06-04 17:43:52 If Apple is wasting time going over new features in the stocks app, they don't have anything to say, and are just doing it because they do this event every year.
1364 2018-06-04 17:43:52 I like that @Apple tried to improve the #Stocks and #VoiceMemo apps—it’s as if they realized that nobody has used them... Ever.
1365 2018-06-04 17:43:51 This lady sure loves her stocks #WWDC18
1366 2018-06-04 17:43:51 The iOS 12 Stocks app features sparklines in tables and in a crawl. Keynote speaker just called them out by name. Cc @EdwardTufte
1367 2018-06-04 17:43:51 People applauded for the fact that Stocks and Voice Memos are now on the iPad. Seriously?
#WWDC18
1368 2018-06-04 17:43:50 Ce bine că au updatat aplicația Stocks. Acum va arăta mai bine în folderul "iPhone Crap".

#WWDC18
1369 2018-06-04 17:43:50 i too don't use siri, stocks or news.
1370 2018-06-04 17:43:49 I bet you could use the amount of applause for stocks things to gauge how much of the applause is staged #wwdc
1371 2018-06-04 17:43:49 "I want a better Stocks app" said no one  #WWDC18
1372 2018-06-04 17:43:48 This lady just said we're super excited to bring news to stocks...#WWDC
1373 2018-06-04 17:43:48 The iPad never had stocks? Interesting… #WWDC18
1374 2018-06-04 17:43:48 did it really take you like 9 years to add stocks and stuff to ipad @Apple
1375 2018-06-04 17:43:47 Is the Stocks app still around? Wow. #wwdc
1376 2018-06-04 17:43:47 (Weak voice) Stocks has news… yay? #WWDC2018
1377 2018-06-04 17:43:47 Stocks app is coming to the #iPad with #ios12… So many ways we can hack educational value from this app… #WWDC2018
1378 2018-06-04 17:43:47 tom x stocks app otp
1379 2018-06-04 17:43:46 You lost me at Stocks App #WWDC18
1380 2018-06-04 17:43:46 I feel bad for the team that works on the Stocks app at Apple. Being the butt of every "useless app people delete immediately" joke must be rough.
1381 2018-06-04 17:43:46 idc about voice memos, stocks, news and apple books 
1382 2018-06-04 17:43:46 Stocks is coming to the iPad so, just like on your iPhone, you can delete it as fast as is humanly possible #WWDC18
1383 2018-06-04 17:43:45 Apple have ran out of ideas lol.... news in stocks like wtf  #WWDC18
1384 2018-06-04 17:43:45 Stocks, Voice memos meh 
1385 2018-06-04 17:43:45 The tone of these announcements seems totally unaware of the hundreds (thousands?) of apps that already do stocks and memos. How is the iPad voice memo that important?
1386 2018-06-04 17:43:44 The first year that you could use Siri to launch apps, I found a bug in the iOS beta where you could open Stocks on iPad. It was clearly not meant to be run there.
1387 2018-06-04 17:43:44 The new Stocks app should have been renamed as Capitalism.
1388 2018-06-04 17:43:44 apple actually did it

they added Stories to the Stocks app
1389 2018-06-04 17:43:43 Bit weird that Stocks and Voice Memos were not on iPad until now? #WWDC18
1390 2018-06-04 17:43:43 Curiously, Stocks and Voice Memos were dark while the other two were not.
1391 2018-06-04 17:43:43 Wowowowow updating to the iOS 12 beta just for stocks #WWDC /s
1392 2018-06-04 17:43:43 "With iOS 12, we're bringing stocks to iPad." Sorry, this just feels like something that works fine in a website to me. #WWDC18
1393 2018-06-04 17:43:42 Pseudo cool 40 to 50 years old talking about the hip stocks and recorder apps on iPad... OmG #keynote #apple
1394 2018-06-04 17:43:41 What I really want is a Stocks apps from Apple that will tell me (and just me) what the stocks will do over the next weeks or months in advance. Please. #WWDC18
1395 2018-06-04 17:43:41 I’m happy they finally updated the stocks app with iOS 12- it’s an app I use multiples a day as an investor. And the iPad support is super! #wwdc18
1396 2018-06-04 17:43:41 iOS 12 traerá noticias del mercado de valores al app de Stocks
1397 2018-06-04 17:43:41 yoooooooo normals dgaf about stocks
1398 2018-06-04 17:43:40 News and Stocks 'updates'? These 3 minutes could have been used instead to tell us something ... useful.
1399 2018-06-04 17:43:39 I don’t care about AR games, I don’t want the robo assistant to learn my habits, I don’t want robo curation of my photos, I absolutely do not want anything or any employee to curate my news input, and if you care about stocks go directly to gulag. And don’t scan my face.
1400 2018-06-04 17:43:39 why are you clapping for voice memos and stocks on iPad?  #WWDC18
1401 2018-06-04 17:43:39 Stocks for iPad on iOS 12?  Great, one more app to delete when I get it. 
1402 2018-06-04 17:43:39 apple software keynotes are wild because it's 50% "oh hey this is really cool" and 50% "you can read stocks on your ipad now"
1403 2018-06-04 17:43:39 not a terribly accurate representation on two counts; a) winter yields were off the charts in 17/18 which will not be repeated this year, b) spring wheat losses reduce buffer stocks 1:1 as the south doesn't carryover stocks.
1404 2018-06-04 17:43:39 I wonder if one can get a Bitcoin ticker in stocks? Hmm.. I've never tried that. #WWDC18
1405 2018-06-04 17:43:37 Love the effort Apple put into their stocks app for iOS 12 #WWDC2018
1406 2018-06-04 17:43:37 Aplikasi stocks & voice memo ada di iPaaaadd...
1407 2018-06-04 17:43:37 Who had an updated Stocks app on their Bingo card? #WWDC18
1408 2018-06-04 17:43:37 The fact that Stocks and Voice Memos is just now coming to iPad is embarrassing. #WWDC2018
1409 2018-06-04 17:43:37 When she said are you ready for stocks app, I thought they were introducing Bitcoin & Etherium as well :p #wwdc #apple #wwdc2018
1410 2018-06-04 17:43:37 #VoiceMemos and #Stocks are now going to the #iPad for the first time! #WWDC18
1411 2018-06-04 17:43:36 I tuned into the #WWDC2018 keynote right when they started talking about Stocks.

What.
1412 2018-06-04 17:43:36 Stocks and Voice Memos are FINALLY coming to iPad! Now just for Weather and Calculator #WWDC18
1413 2018-06-04 17:43:35 Clapping for Stocks for iPad is a look into the void #WWDC18
1414 2018-06-04 17:43:35 I’m so glad Apple had the “courage” to rework the Stocks app. #WWDC2018
1415 2018-06-04 17:43:35 If only Great Grandpa Beauregard were here to hear that Apple IS BRINGING STOCKS TO IPAD.
1416 2018-06-04 17:43:34 Stocks on the iPad ...wow ... and voice memos ...
1417 2018-06-04 17:43:34 Apple News: now available in the Stocks app! Two of your least favorite apps in one!
1418 2018-06-04 17:43:34 I didn't need stocks on iPad. A calculator and native weather app would have more use #wwdc2018
1419 2018-06-04 17:43:34 Oh yay stocks and voice memos updated in iOS 12 wow so much fun
1420 2018-06-04 17:43:34 Stocks + News.
Das ist für US-Kunden. In Deutschland investiert ja keiner in Aktien... #WWDC2018
1421 2018-06-04 17:43:33 If adding the stocks app to iPad makes your big announcement....we may be in trouble. #WWDC18
1422 2018-06-04 17:43:33 Apple is brining Apple news to stocks App so at least it’s in a place where I don’t have to see it.
1423 2018-06-04 17:43:33 Why are you clapping for stocks. No one cares about the Stocks app #wwdc18
1424 2018-06-04 17:43:33 ‘I’m so glad Apple have revamped the stocks app!!!’ — Nobody, ever. #WWDC2018
1425 2018-06-04 17:43:33 колку е горда Susan на Stocks апликацијата  #WWDC18
1426 2018-06-04 17:43:33 OH MY GOD APPLE NEWS IN STOCKS OMGOMGOMGOMGOGOMOGOMG
1427 2018-06-04 17:43:32 They're talking about the Stocks app and I'm thinking, "There's still a Stocks app?"
1428 2018-06-04 17:43:32 Stocks on iPad!? Who cares! How about Weather on iPad! You know, the weather app, the one that people actually use. No one uses Apple's stocks app
1429 2018-06-04 17:43:32 I don’t use Stocks and I don’t use News much, so it’s not exciting to me, but I’m sure some people will love the new News-Stocks integration. #WWDC18 #WWDC2018
1430 2018-06-04 17:43:31 Who forgot there was a stocks app  #WWDC2018
1431 2018-06-04 17:43:31 Do these stock news articles reflect Indian stock market?  Does it depend on the kind of stocks I add to the watchlist? #WWDC18
1432 2018-06-04 17:43:31 "we're bringing stocks to ipad"
Uwot
C'était pas dejà dispo .w.
Sérieusement apple mettez vos apps partout
1433 2018-06-04 17:43:31 iPad 에 없던 Stocks, Voice memo 옮겨주고 생색내는 애플 #WWDC18
1434 2018-06-04 17:43:30 “We’re bringing stocks.. to iPad” :’D #WWDC2018
1435 2018-06-04 17:43:30 Stocks, Another app ill immediately delete upon updating. #WWDC18
1436 2018-06-04 17:43:30 I might finally use the Stocks app now #WWDC18
1437 2018-06-04 17:43:30 Wait... Millennials don't care about stocks! All we care about is avocado toast! 
#WWDC18
1438 2018-06-04 17:43:30 apple wwdc keynote, they added news to the stocks app and felt the need to announce that at ... a developer conference
1439 2018-06-04 17:43:30 Stocks is getting a redesign with News integration!!

#WWDC2018
1440 2018-06-04 17:43:30 Blimey, Apple news in stocks is neat - Bloomberg might want to start getting worried #WWDC18
1441 2018-06-04 17:43:30 Finally, the two least used iOS apps are now one, making it that much easier to uninstall stocks and news!
1442 2018-06-04 17:43:29 Apple right now "YO DAWG WE HEARD YOU LIKE APPLE NEWS SO WE PUT APPLE NEWS IN YOUR APPLE STOCKS APP"
1443 2018-06-04 17:43:29 News, Stocks, … wenn gleich noch Apple Pay kommt, zünde ich den Fernseher an

#WWDC2018 #appleevent
1444 2018-06-04 17:43:29 What? Do people really use the #Stocks app?!
1445 2018-06-04 17:43:29 Stocks is coming to iPad. Great now I’ve got to hide it in a folder or uninstall it on even more devices now #WWDC #WWDC18
1446 2018-06-04 17:43:29 new in iOS, Apple rips off Robinhood with their Stocks app update.
1447 2018-06-04 17:43:28 Sorry, Apple built "Stocks" app coming to iPad is KEYNOTE worthy?  Seriously? #WWDC18
1448 2018-06-04 17:43:28 Apple news in stocks. Wut?
1449 2018-06-04 17:43:28 Literally nobody uses Stocks??? #WWDC
1450 2018-06-04 17:43:28 The new stocks app is basically the Yahoo Finance app. Lol #WWDC
1451 2018-06-04 17:43:28 Yayyy stocks! My favourite! #WWDC2018
1452 2018-06-04 17:43:28 News on Stocks: the killer. No sé cómo hemos podido aguantar sin @quifago
1453 2018-06-04 17:43:28 and the #WWDC announcement you've all been waiting for..............
....
........
....
*new* stocks app!
1454 2018-06-04 17:43:27 OMG STOCKS ON IPAD AND APPLE NEWS IN STOCKS APP!!!!1111 #sarcasm #WWDC2018
1455 2018-06-04 17:43:27 #WWDC : Apple News coming to Stocks. Business news curated by Apple News editors. Articles without leaving the app.
1456 2018-06-04 17:43:27 Nobody uses the stocks app. Either introduce a dark mode or move on to MacOS. #wwdc
1457 2018-06-04 17:43:27 Les juro que pensé que iban a decir "bueno, ahora puedes eliminar la app de Stocks, para siempre!" No podemos tenerlo todo en la vida. #WWDC18
1458 2018-06-04 17:43:27 “With iOS12, we’re bringing Stocks to the iPad”

OMG YES
1459 2018-06-04 17:43:26 Ich will nicht STOCKS und VOICEMEMOS.. ICH WILL EINEN TASCHENRECHNER UND WETTER VERDAMMT NOCHMAL #WWDC18
1460 2018-06-04 17:43:25 I'm watching the apple thing (?) and they're talking about the stocks app (??) and people are clapping (?????)
1461 2018-06-04 17:43:25 Am I the only one who thinks stocks app is not really WWDC worthy? #WWDC18
1462 2018-06-04 17:43:25 Oh my god. Apple News is now on Stocks! APPLE NEWS. STOCKS.
1463 2018-06-04 17:43:25 Ok they gotta bring the calculator app to the iPad now if Stocks and Voice memos gets some love
1464 2018-06-04 17:43:25 Apple brought Stocks to the iPad before @instagram has an iPad app
1465 2018-06-04 17:43:25 Jumping into Twitter to say that I'm the happiest person in the world for a Stocks update. Finally.

There are no good stock-tracking apps on iOS. Apple's is great and is now even better.
1466 2018-06-04 17:43:25 How are people cheering for the stocks app... am I just too poor to be excited about this or what.
1467 2018-06-04 17:43:25 ah yes, Apple Stocks, because everyone who owns an Apple product automatically has enough money to be actively invested in the stock market
1468 2018-06-04 17:43:24 How is Stocks getting this much presentation time?  #wwdc
1469 2018-06-04 17:43:24 Beatles on iTunes. #stocks
1470 2018-06-04 17:43:24 Wait I thought Stocks was a joke
1471 2018-06-04 17:43:23 Why does iOS even HAVE a stocks app to begin with? Is that just a US thing, or do they throw in software literally no one uses just for shits and giggles?
1472 2018-06-04 17:43:23 if you cheered for Stocks on iPad, gfy
1473 2018-06-04 17:43:22 Stocks for iPad is the kind of innovation I expect from Apple.
1474 2018-06-04 17:43:22 Stocks and Voice Memos coming to iPad - it’s about time. #WWDC18
1475 2018-06-04 17:43:22 Apple bygger om appen Stocks för iPad. #toppish
1476 2018-06-04 17:43:22 Stocks and voice memos should have been on iPad this whole time but cool I guess??? #WWDC2018
1477 2018-06-04 17:43:22 stocks?  #WWDC18
1478 2018-06-04 17:43:22 Also.. ich lösche die meisten Apps vom Hause Apple instant nach jedem Update.
Stocks und News z.B. 

Braucht niemand, VOR ALLEM NICHT AUF DEM IPAD!!!! 

Danke!
1479 2018-06-04 17:43:21 If you’re excited about a redesigned Stocks app you’re probably rich but I still feel bad for you, son #WWDC
1480 2018-06-04 17:43:21 People use Stocks app in #iPhone ?? Wow thats a new thing i learned today :P #WWDC #AppleWWDC
1481 2018-06-04 17:43:21 The iOS stocks app always feels to me that its more about Apple employees wanting to check their portfolio than their normal customers that don’t have any stocks. That or start up companies.  #wwdc2018
1482 2018-06-04 17:43:20 @klmcmahon APPLE NEWS TO THE STOCKS APP!!!! THIS IS NOT A FUCKING DRILL!!!!#$!$#$#!%%^%%@
1483 2018-06-04 17:43:20 Só lembrando que não tem Apple News por aqui então no Stocks fica só o clássico market news de sempre mesmo
1484 2018-06-04 17:43:20 at 41 minutes into the Keynote  Apple announced... News integrated into Stocks #WWDC2018
1485 2018-06-04 17:43:20 #WWDC18 omg stocks!!! How interesting 
1486 2018-06-04 17:43:19 I’ve never used the Stocks app lol. This looks cool I guess, a tutorial on how to use it or how to understand stocks would be cool too though  #WWDC18
1487 2018-06-04 17:43:19 WATCH YOUR STOCKS WHILE YOU READ YOUR NEWS!

Oh, you mean a newspaper?

#WWDC18
1488 2018-06-04 17:43:19 Is bringing stocks to iPad worth a wow?  #wwdc2018
1489 2018-06-04 17:43:19 Alter müssen die Amis alle Aktien haben… #stocks #WWDC
1490 2018-06-04 17:43:19 Gonna make a lot of use of the new Stocks app  #WWDC18 wish you could trade too  #fintech
1491 2018-06-04 17:43:19 Did they add news to Stocks just so they could fill the iPad screen? #WWDC
1492 2018-06-04 17:43:18 Finally - they are bringing the Stocks app to the iPad - only took how many years. (8) #WWDC18
1493 2018-06-04 17:43:18 I never knew so many people cared so much about a Stocks app.
1494 2018-06-04 17:43:18 Apple "completely rebuild" the Stocks app. So now it can celebrate hitting the $1 trillion valuation. #WWDC18
1495 2018-06-04 17:43:18 wow.......voice memos.........and news in stocks..........cool..... #WWDC18
1496 2018-06-04 17:43:18 Wait people actually use the News and Stocks apps?
1497 2018-06-04 17:43:18 WHO THE HELL WAS CLAMORING FOR STOCKS ON IPAD???  #WWDC18
1498 2018-06-04 17:43:18 The stocks app comes to iPad
1499 2018-06-04 17:43:17 Susan has spent longer presenting this redesign than I ever have using the Stocks app
1500 2018-06-04 17:43:17 Nobody gives a shit about the stocks app. It’s the first app to go into a  folder since iOS 3 and be deleted since iOS 11.
1501 2018-06-04 17:43:16 Do people really use the stocks app?
#WWDC
1502 2018-06-04 17:43:16 Stocks info is being added to Apple News in the IOS12 update. #WWDC18
1503 2018-06-04 17:43:16 Stocks and Voice Memos are going to be available on the iPad, finally!
1504 2018-06-04 17:43:15 Meh on the Stocks app, but Voice Recorder on iPad is exactly what I want. #wwdc18
1505 2018-06-04 17:43:15 I always think to myself “man, wish I had the stocks app on my iPad.”
1506 2018-06-04 17:43:15 I FORGOT I WAS MAD STOCKS WASN'T ON THE IPAD NOW I'M MAD ALL OVER AGAIN
1507 2018-06-04 17:43:15 Stocks en iPad antes que calculadora #WWDC18
1508 2018-06-04 17:43:15 Get that’s stocks app away from MY iPad #wwdc18
1509 2018-06-04 17:43:15 Talking about the Stocks and Voice memos apps? This is really starting to sound like the snow leopard iOS release. #WWDC18
1510 2018-06-04 17:43:14 I vote “We’re bringing Apple News to stocks!” as the least exciting announcement of #WWDC18
1511 2018-06-04 17:43:14 Now you can see the #stocks in the News App with #iOS12
1512 2018-06-04 17:43:14 Stocks to iPad. Mid keynote lull… zzzzzz #WWDC18
1513 2018-06-04 17:43:14 Apple adding new features to the Stocks app, you know - the most uninstalled stock app on iOS. #WWDC18
1514 2018-06-04 17:43:14 Stocks is coming to iPad... Why can't weather and calculator come to iPad too!!!! #WWDC18
1515 2018-06-04 17:43:14 Why are we talking STOCKS APPS?? What year is it??!?
1516 2018-06-04 17:43:13 "We're bringing stocks to ipad" = Most boring sentence of any WWDC. #WWDC18
1517 2018-06-04 17:43:13 yeah yeah stocks and voice recorder on ipad is cool but where is the calculator on ipad
1518 2018-06-04 17:43:13 Stocks will have relevant headlines curated from Apple News headlines along with an after hours chart. You can read full articles in Stocks without leaving the app. Stocks is also coming to the iPad in iOS 12. #AppleEvent #live
1519 2018-06-04 17:43:13 Apple developers go wild with... stocks?!?
1520 2018-06-04 17:43:13 Stocks on iPad! More convenient flight details! Relatable new features if you’re a silicon valley executive. #wwdc
1521 2018-06-04 17:43:13 Oh wow, Apple news is coming to the stocks app?!? Cool! #SaidNooneEver #WWDC
1522 2018-06-04 17:43:13 Stocks doesn’t matter. Why is Apple making such a big deal about this app??
1523 2018-06-04 17:43:13 I hope she talks about Stocks the whole time #WWDC18
1524 2018-06-04 17:43:12 I don’t really look after stocks too much but cool I guess
1525 2018-06-04 17:43:12 Maybe I’ve got it wrong. Maybe their crafty and there’s something amazing coming and their just trolling with “Stocks for iPad” and Voice Memos… #WWDC
1526 2018-06-04 17:43:12 これまでiPad版のStocksがなかったことを、いまはじめて知った。 #wwdc18
1527 2018-06-04 17:43:12 finde ich übelst die gute idee das in stocks zu verpacken!
1528 2018-06-04 17:43:12 "Now it includes News". Someone tell her that the Stocks app already  had news...
1529 2018-06-04 17:43:11 Stocks. Keeping an eye on my stocks. That's worth keynote time at WWDC?
1530 2018-06-04 17:43:11 Stocks on iPad? Gorgeous right panel in news? Seriously? #WWDC18
1531 2018-06-04 17:43:11 $AAPL revamps stocks app !! And to iPad FINALLY !! One of my most used apps…
1532 2018-06-04 17:43:10 "Siri, how are my stocks doing?"
"Like 99.9% of people, you have no stocks."
"Then why does Apple keep making such a big deal of this?"
"Would you like to go surfing?"
1533 2018-06-04 17:43:10 News app ho hum. News in Stocks ho hum. #wwdc stocks on iPad is good. Waste of space including news though. I’d like stock charting tools.
1534 2018-06-04 17:43:10 The bit where they talk about Stocks where I scratch my balls and fart and wonder if I should be better with money.
1535 2018-06-04 17:43:10 Stocks app now on iPad with #iOS12. Something more to delete... for me anyway
1536 2018-06-04 17:43:10 Steve Jobs would never have put news in stocks! #WWDC2018
1537 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Apple News on Stocks
Stocks on iPad 

Woo! I need iOS 12 NOW!!
1538 2018-06-04 17:43:09 I never liked having the Stocks app in my phone until I became an adult. I’m glad they’re finally updating it #WWDC18
1539 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Apple News, inside of the Stocks app. @Apple I can't believe you've done this but you have revolutionized the world again.
1540 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Tbh I'm waiting for macOS 10.14 more than iOS 12 that will bring stocks with business views and new voice memos to iPad
1541 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Can’t wait to read your take on this Stocks update esp. after hour pricing. The audience must have gone nuts hearing this announcement.
1542 2018-06-04 17:43:09 It only took 12 IOS versions to get Stocks on the iPad. So maybe a calculator in iOS 13?
1543 2018-06-04 17:43:09 "We're bringing stocks to iPad." WHEN ARE YOU BRINGING WEATHER TO IPAD!? #WWDC2018
1544 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Not ONE PERSON cares about the stocks app.
1545 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Huh.. the iOS 12 stocks app looks so cluttered now
1546 2018-06-04 17:43:09 Stocks on iPad!!!! Just what I’ve always wanted 

Oh wait
1547 2018-06-04 17:43:09 no one wants stocks on anything. #WWDC2018
1548 2018-06-04 17:43:08 Pretty much the most dramatic redesign to Stocks since, ever. #WWDC18
1549 2018-06-04 17:43:08 Remember the Stocks App? #wwdc18
1550 2018-06-04 17:43:08 Stocks on iPad? WOW!!! #WWDC18
1551 2018-06-04 17:43:07 We redesigned the stocks app. Because none of you people would open it before and we were tired of it just sitting there.  #WWDC18
1552 2018-06-04 17:43:07 Oh good it only took them a decade to bring the stocks app to the iPad

Calculator when please
1553 2018-06-04 17:43:07 LOL … stocks app on iPad after 8 years … why? #WWDC
1554 2018-06-04 17:43:07 If they bring stocks, maybe also calc?
1555 2018-06-04 17:43:07 Apple sigue evolucionando su app de Bolsa / Stocks pero siguen sin aparecer las criptomonedas. Meh. #WWDC18
1556 2018-06-04 17:43:06 There's definitely not like dozens of apps to manage stocks for iOS already, right? #WWDC18
1557 2018-06-04 17:43:06 You know they are light on content when Stocks is getting so much play time
1558 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Probably should have led with Stocks on iPad and not Stocks gets Apple News integration.
1559 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Gonna be honest, I don't think anyone asked for the stocks app on the iPad #WWDC
1560 2018-06-04 17:43:06 #WWDC18 who the fuck uses the stocks app?
1561 2018-06-04 17:43:06 I am confused - could you not look up stocks and other information about them before iOS12?
1562 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Apple News in Stocks app. #dontcare
1563 2018-06-04 17:43:06 iOS 12 brings the Stocks app to the iPad #WWDC18
1564 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Everybody, the news app and the stocks app had a baby. Anybody???
1565 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Stocks to iPad too?!?!? #WWDC18
1566 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Stocks on iPad, Finally! #WWDC2018
1567 2018-06-04 17:43:06 We're bringing Stocks to iPad! *applause* #WWDC #WWDC18 what the fuck what even that's not even a proper feature and should've been there since 3.2, SAME FOR VOICE MEMOS
1568 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Stocks conseguiu seu canto no Apple News. #wwdc18
1569 2018-06-04 17:43:06 Siri Shortcuts in iOS12 looks great. It’s like Workflow built into iOS. It’s all about speeding up the things you do every day.

And then they pivot into trying making the Stocks app relevant... 

#wwdc
1570 2018-06-04 17:43:05 I’m sure rich folks will appreciate the upgrade to the Stocks app. It looks really great.
1571 2018-06-04 17:43:05 you guys, do you know we can check crypto in the stocks app?

#WWDC18
1572 2018-06-04 17:43:05 Stocks on iPad? What about weather? #WWDC18
1573 2018-06-04 17:43:05 Stocks app in white? I have a feeling dark mode is definitely coming
1574 2018-06-04 17:43:05 Stocks coming to iPad with #iOS12.

@Apple #AppleEvent #WWDC18
1575 2018-06-04 17:43:05 They really have absolutely nothing for this keynote. Stocks is getting multiple minutes on screen.
1576 2018-06-04 17:43:04 But Paul, it’s got news in it now! News! In the Stocks app! Exciting!!!!
1577 2018-06-04 17:43:04 Finally Stocks in iPad. #wwdc2018 #wwdc18
1578 2018-06-04 17:43:04 #Apple lancia le #business #news, integrando #AppleNews e l'app #stocks!

1581 2018-06-04 17:43:04 No one was checking for the stocks app. Let alone adding news to it  #WWDC18
1582 2018-06-04 17:43:04 Stocks app on iPad finally
1583 2018-06-04 17:43:04 Has Apple ever actually talked about the Stocks app or Voice Memos app onstage before? #WWDC18
1584 2018-06-04 17:43:03 I knew it! I knew one day, Stocks app was gonna get some work!
1585 2018-06-04 17:43:03 STOCKS TO IPAD.

A tumbleweed, stage-right.
1586 2018-06-04 17:43:03 Так, ну ща пиздец. 

"Are you ready? We're putting Apple News to Stocks."

Are you fucking kidding me? Вот эта да! Не был готов, конечно.
1587 2018-06-04 17:43:03 Much love for that popular apple app stocks

1605 2018-06-04 17:43:01 You know they don't have many new things when they talk about the stocks app.
1606 2018-06-04 17:43:01 Omg Apple news in stocks!!!!! Mind absolutely blown. I mean I dunno how anyone will be able to use anything else  but iOS.
1607 2018-06-04 17:43:01 This woman has to be about the only one who is excited about the integration of news into the Stocks app. #WWDC18
1608 2018-06-04 17:43:01 lol. stocks app that no one uses gets more features for no one to use. oh and now its on iPad

1621 2018-06-04 17:43:00 So glad Apple isn't completely out of touch and updated how I can view my stocks! #WWDC18
1622 2018-06-04 17:43:00 Redesigned Stocks app!
1623 2018-06-04 17:42:59 #WWDC18 would have been a lot more excited about the stocks overhaul if they added crypto currency support. It’d be the one thing that would have made me use the app.
1624 2018-06-04 17:42:59 After hours pricing in the new Apple News stocks app is long overdue. #WWDC18
1625 2018-06-04 17:42:59 Stocks will come to iPad with iOS 12.
1626 2018-06-04 17:42:59 de verdd le aplauden a la app de stocks?

1628 2018-06-04 17:42:59 They’ve been slowly adding coins to the Stocks app.
1629 2018-06-04 17:42:58 Confession: I really like the Apple native stocks app. (And I mostly dislike all the other Apple 1st party apps.)
1630 2018-06-04 17:42:58 Stocks will have relevant headlines curated from Apple News headlines along with an after hours chart. You can read full articles in Stocks without leaving the app. Stocks is also coming to the iPad in iOS 12.
1631 2018-06-04 17:42:58 Mdr stocks to iPad 
Et la calculatrice ??? #WWDC18
1632 2018-06-04 17:42:58 No one cares about stocks on iPad. GIVE ME A CALCULATOR.

1634 2018-06-04 17:42:58 So.....since the iPad's introduction in 2010, they're ginally bringing Stocks and Voice Memos to iPad. #WWDC
1635 2018-06-04 17:42:57 Stocks on iPad, the app that nobody was clamoring for. #wwdc2018
1636 2018-06-04 17:42:57 Seriously, Apple, no one likes the Stocks app.
1637 2018-06-04 17:42:57 Stocks. Integrates with Apple News to show stories related to the performance of the stocks you choose. Also now included on iPad, was previously only on iPhone. #WWDC18
1638 2018-06-04 17:42:57 Stocks is the first app many people take off.
1639 2018-06-04 17:42:57 but stocks tho...
1640 2018-06-04 17:42:57 I would've been more impressed if the new Stocks app had Machine Learning integrated to preview what they think stocks will do tomorrow... but adding news is... something. #WWDC18
1641 2018-06-04 17:42:56 Laaaangweilig! #stocks #WWDC18 braucht keiner, bzw. wir in Deutschland können es eh (noch) nicht.
1642 2018-06-04 17:42:56 wow she really thought it was a big deal to include news with stocks?  #WWDC18
1643 2018-06-04 17:42:56 Apple Stocks 2018 = Yahoo Finance 2015 #wwdc

1647 2018-06-04 17:42:56 Apple has rebuilt the Stocks app and integrated the News app….kay.  But at least it’s finally coming to iPad!
1648 2018-06-04 17:42:56 "We are bringing Apple News to Stocks "

1650 2018-06-04 17:42:56 Genuinely curious, who uses stocks? #wwdc
1651 2018-06-04 17:42:55 Apple News is coming to Stocks. The business news is curated by Apple News Editors #wwdc2018
1652 2018-06-04 17:42:55 The Stocks app is getting a makeover, including integration with Apple News. We bet it will still remain unused on most iOS devices. #WWDC2018 #Appleevent
1653 2018-06-04 17:42:54 “We’re bringing #AppleNews to Stocks” #WWDC 
1654 2018-06-04 17:42:54 BREAKING: Apple is bringing news directly into the stocks app. #Courage #WWDC

1658 2018-06-04 17:42:54 They're bringing the stocks application to iPad. yaay.
1659 2018-06-04 17:42:53 Whoever wrote the script for the updated Stocks app felt it was necessary to follow up the introduction of inline stock graphs with the explanation “That’s cool”
1660 2018-06-04 17:42:53 I can look up the news while looking at stocks!! I can also look at relevant news which will be so convenient. #WWDC18 and it’s coming to iPad! #iOS12

1664 2018-06-04 17:42:52 Being asked to present News and Stocks and then to mash them up and declare it exciting is a hell of a tough gig. #WWDC18
1665 2018-06-04 17:42:52 FINALLY, THE STOCKS IS COMING TO IPAD!!!! FUCK YEAH
1666 2018-06-04 17:42:52 While Google News is all machine, Apple News and Stocks is by hand picked editors! Common Apple, you can do better!

1669 2018-06-04 17:42:52 Finally, the Stocks app is on the iPad
1670 2018-06-04 17:42:52 The detail for individual stocks is very detailed. This is no longer a toy app. They have an #iPad version too. Watch stocks and read news at the same time. #WWDC18
1671 2018-06-04 17:42:51 How many of the apple users, use stocks....
1672 2018-06-04 17:42:51 Suzanne's excited about news in stocks  #WWDC18

1680 2018-06-04 17:42:50 I'm impressed at how stoked Apple is about their Stocks app. I don't care about the app, but they seem really excited about it.
1681 2018-06-04 17:42:49 Why no Siri suggestions for which stocks to buy, though? Really bringing together all the new features #WWDC
1682 2018-06-04 17:42:49 And uses the Stocks app.
1683 2018-06-04 17:42:49 Now... They'll bring damn stocks to iPad... WHAT ABOUT A CALCULATOR?!??

1689 2018-06-04 17:42:48 I’m sure Stocks update was on top of everyone’s wish list right? #WWDC18
1690 2018-06-04 17:42:48 bringing stocks to iPad #WWDC18
1691 2018-06-04 17:42:48 First measurements and now Stocks? I understand it’s about software but I don’t see how that’s interesting for developers. #WWDC18
1692 2018-06-04 17:42:48 I didn't even know about Apple Stocks lol... I need to get on that asap
1693 2018-06-04 17:42:47 From ARKit (meh) to Photos (sorta meh) to Siri Shortcuts (!!!!) to Stocks (end me). This keynote is a real rollercoaster. #WWDC18
1694 2018-06-04 17:42:47 Wait why is Stocks not dark on iPad
1695 2018-06-04 17:42:47 Do people still use the Stocks App on iOS?
1696 2018-06-04 17:42:46 Bring calculator to iPad! I don’t want Stocks! #WWDC
1697 2018-06-04 17:42:46 She is trying so hard to make the Stocks app sound cool.

1702 2018-06-04 17:42:45 Stocks on iPad
1703 2018-06-04 17:42:45 "PLEASE USE OUR STOCKS APP" - Apple #WWDC2018
1704 2018-06-04 17:42:44 Adding News to Stocks?!?   The crowd goes tepid! #WWDC18
1705 2018-06-04 17:42:44 We are so happy to announce: We are bringing Apple News to Stocks ,… Echt jetzt? Und in China fiel ein Reissack um. #ApfeltalkLIVE #wwdc18

1709 2018-06-04 17:42:43 Stocks to iPad I'm fucking mind blown
1710 2018-06-04 17:42:43 They’re legit talking about Stocks, the number one junk app on iOS.
1711 2018-06-04 17:42:43 they're dedicating time to the stocks app, the app that you don't open until there's a news alert

so how's your #wwdc going?
1712 2018-06-04 17:42:43 Are you ready? We’re bringing Apple News to Stocks! Ох, я не был готов к такому! Вот это да
1713 2018-06-04 17:42:43 STOCKS! FUCK ME! That'll bring the rivals to their knees.
1714 2018-06-04 17:42:43 I like the new sidebar for stocks. This will be useful for keeping tabs for the markets. #WWDC
1715 2018-06-04 17:42:43 I can’t believe they’re spending WWDC keynote time on the Stocks app.
1716 2018-06-04 17:42:43 Okay stocks on iPad but no Calculator for iPad still?
1717 2018-06-04 17:42:42 Stocks, coffee, gym, Apple just don't understand my life anymore. #WWDC18
1718 2018-06-04 17:42:42 Stocks now integrates with Apple News, I assume like MSN Money has always done
1719 2018-06-04 17:42:42 So, Stocks is trying to catch up to what  Yahoo Finance was 5 years ago. #WWDC2018
1720 2018-06-04 17:42:42 Stocks to ipad noice I have a reason to use my ipad
1721 2018-06-04 17:42:42 Stocks app update. Fucking FINALLY.

1723 2018-06-04 17:42:41 The feature I like best about the Stocks app is the ability to delete it. #WWDC18
1724 2018-06-04 17:42:41 Stocks ไม่มีของไทยอยู่ดี #wwdc18
1725 2018-06-04 17:42:41 “We’re so excited to announce we’re bringing Apple News to Stocks!” - Really Susan? You’re “so excited” about this?
1726 2018-06-04 17:42:41 iPad getting two stock apps it probably should have had years ago: voice memos and stocks #wwdc18
1727 2018-06-04 17:42:41 Might actually re-download the native stocks app #WWDC
1728 2018-06-04 17:42:40 THATS WHAT I WANTED. TO PUT NEWS IN MY STOCKS APP. THE TWO APPS I USE ALL THE TIME. HOW ARE MY STOCKS? WHAT IS THE NEWZ?! 

Wait. I use a pixel. I'm good.

1730 2018-06-04 17:42:40 Apple News is now built into Stocks, and there’s a few more improvements to the News app itself. Is News coming to Canada, finally, though? #WWDC2018

1735 2018-06-04 17:42:39 "We're bringing Apple News to Stocks" is possibly the most boring sentence ever uttered at WWDC.
1736 2018-06-04 17:42:39 Apple News app has improvements for easier access to favourites and finding related feeds. Stocks app totally rebuilt to include a special stock-related curated Apple News feed
1737 2018-06-04 17:42:39 iOS 12 Stocks app, lets be honest for some users they wont get excited about _any_ changes to this app 
#WWDC #WWDC18 #WWDC2018 #AppleEvent

1748 2018-06-04 17:42:37 Apple News in Stocks? This hurts. #WWDC18
1749 2018-06-04 17:42:37 Why not bring Apple News to Canada? Or Mac OS? I dont care about stocks. #WWDC2018
1750 2018-06-04 17:42:37 Why is stocks still a default app

w h y
1755 2018-06-04 17:42:36 Revamped Stocks app with integration of News. If I traded at all, that’d be nice.  #WWDC18
1756 2018-06-04 17:42:36 "We're bringing apple news to stocks" cue sad claps
1757 2018-06-04 17:42:36 The faux enthusiasm from these presenters is something else…how excited can you or anyone else really by that News has incorporated with the Stocks app?

1763 2018-06-04 17:42:35 I don’t like the apple news or stocks app. Anything they can do to make those better is appreciated #WWDC18
1764 2018-06-04 17:42:35 They're so excited to bring News to Stocks?! This is WWDC worthy? #WWDC18

1776 2018-06-04 17:42:33 Apple News app has "Browse" options in #iOS12 and combined with Stocks apps  #WWDC18
1777 2018-06-04 17:42:33 Imagine being the Apple employee who has to talk about adding Apple News to the Stocks app in front of 300 people lol
1778 2018-06-04 17:42:33 Haha, so much excitement for Stocks :P

1784 2018-06-04 17:42:32 Die Stocks App bekam ein neues Design. Außerdem wurde die News App dort integriert. Dort werden dann vorwiegend Wirtschaftsnews angezeigt #WWDC2018

1789 2018-06-04 17:42:32 They’re showcasing the stocks app. An app that hasn’t been touched since ios1. You can hear the barrel being scraped. Sorry, iBarrel.  #WWDC18
1790 2018-06-04 17:42:31 Apple News… to stocks. The fact this intended to be newsworthy is.. troubling.
1791 2018-06-04 17:42:31 news in stocks, carefully curated by apple news editors... to help you uh make stock pricing decisions? #wwdc
1792 2018-06-04 17:42:31 This stocks update is such a long time coming.
1793 2018-06-04 17:42:31 So you @RobinhoodApp kids can buy more stocks... yay :) #WWDC
1794 2018-06-04 17:42:31 Why are they talking about Apple News, Stocks and Books? Nobody ever uses these apps! Most people put those apps in folders and never open that folder again  #WWDC18 #AppleEvent
1795 2018-06-04 17:42:31 Apple News has collided with Stocks and you can get your stories related to the stock you're interested in without leaving the app. #WWDC18
1796 2018-06-04 17:42:30 @richpassmore they are talking about news and stocks - I’ve never opened either.  Does anyone in the universe get their news from the news app? #WWDC18
1797 2018-06-04 17:42:30 Demasiada emoción le ha dado a lo de la integración de Apple News en Stocks. #WWDC18
1798 2018-06-04 17:42:30 A loud applause to "top stories in stocks" and i'm done. Moving on.
1799 2018-06-04 17:42:30 I saw it coming but it only took Apple 10 years to update the stocks app lol
1800 2018-06-04 17:42:30 "We're bringing Apple News to Stocks."

Great, the two apps I'm least likely to use. (If I want RSS I use an RSS reader.)
1801 2018-06-04 17:42:29 Apple’s now showing off improvements to the Stocks app – yeah, that! – with an integrated pane of business news from the Apple News service.
1802 2018-06-04 17:42:29 No puedo creer que ella le pregunto al publico que si estaban listos para ver Apple News en Stocks…
1803 2018-06-04 17:42:29 "We've completly rebuild the stocks app" so it can display our ONE TRILLION NET WORTH, SUCKERS!!  #WWDC18
1804 2018-06-04 17:42:29 Susan keeps claiming these updates are “cool” and “fun”..... they’re not Susan. Stop trying to make Stocks happen #WWDC18
1805 2018-06-04 17:42:29 Apple need to stocks? Omfg how did I live before this? #wwdc18

1808 2018-06-04 17:42:28 So basically Apple have given up then? Siri Shortcuts the only interesting thing so far. Now they’re talking about… the Stocks app? #WWDC
1809 2018-06-04 17:42:28 STOCKSの見た目が良くなったのはいいね。今のやつって初代からUI変わってないもんね…。#iOS12 #WWDC18
1810 2018-06-04 17:42:28 Stocks is the lamest standard app on iPhone. #WWDC
1811 2018-06-04 17:42:27 Totally expected Apple to add crypto tracking to the stocks app 
1812 2018-06-04 17:42:27 Everyone: So these keyboards are broken.
Apple: We're bringing Apple News to Stocks
Everyone: WHAT
1813 2018-06-04 17:42:26 Congrats to the one person on the planet who had “Stocks app refresh” on their bingo card. #wwdc

1816 2018-06-04 17:42:25 Following the Siri demo with stocks demo is a hard act to follow. Brutal. #WWDC
1817 2018-06-04 17:42:25 Quality cringe moment #WWDC #stocks
1818 2018-06-04 17:42:25 Apple uppdaterar (äntligen!) "Stocks" appen. Ge oss ett realtidsflöde nu! Snälla? #applevaka

2010 2018-06-04 17:40:46 Jim, you are too bullish on the defense stocks. Your team needs to understand US DoD Acquisition Laws and Regs. This yr's budget will be wasted on salary increases, new uniforms, and office remodeling. The new hardware purchases will be lowered or flat. A post-it on your head?

2024 2018-06-04 17:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2025 2018-06-04 17:39:00 It was Sat 22nd last year before Stocks was announced, ever the optimistic so I am have faith #peskyflyers 2.0 are coming 
2026 2018-06-04 17:38:39 At midday, MBS slightly lower. Stocks holding gains. 10-yr yield 2.92%.
2027 2018-06-04 17:38:10 I've been on the @BakerlooLine & tried to keep a board-straight posture without using the backrest & been asked why. For want of a better excuse I said "riding instructor said I should develop my back muscles". The 72 stocks have a nice acceleration pattern for that.
2028 2018-06-04 17:37:53 Stocks open higher .... Dow +200 points.
2029 2018-06-04 17:37:48 Granny Smith green apples should have a mass-produced and widely available juice. It'd boost Mott's stocks. Lol

2032 2018-06-04 17:36:30 Prohibition was the origin of what we know now as selling drugs...that’s how they really started making crazy money before buying up all the socks and transportation hubs...that’s low key how Joseph Kennedy made his fortune..outside of “Stocks” during Great Depression
2033 2018-06-04 17:34:53 Today the stocks came near the peak they had reached in late January.  5 months of needless wild volatility.

2037 2018-06-04 17:32:29 The NRA is another political party in America &helps decide gun laws.

It was right after he had the
NRA to Mar a Lago.

2048 2018-06-04 17:28:42 FYI re AAPL:

Hits 1 Trillion @ $197.32.
Also, historically, stocks in the 90s, 190s, 290s, etc. USUALLY hit the round number 100, 200, 300, etc.

CAUTION: people usually set their stops at the round number.

How come Jon's "Unusual Activity" stocks always go down instead of up? 

I've been checking the claims of stock prognosticators for 4 decades.

I can tell a good call from a bad one.

What kind of scam are you guys running?

2058 2018-06-04 17:24:31 I thought Lebron played better than KD across the finals last year. 

KD - 35 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 2.6 Stocks, 2.2 TOS, 70% true shooting

Lebron - 33.6-12-10-2.4, 4.2 turnovers, 63% true shooting

Lebrons offensive load was so much bigger

2073 2018-06-04 17:20:47 The fact that the wall of iOS12 features includes the Stocks app shows just how small this update will be?

2107 2018-06-04 17:07:33 Can a bakery enforce a uniform policy of no lettering on any wedding cakes?
If a bakery only stocks het-couple figurines that are a conjoined (holding hands) mass of plastic, you create the same question as whether you compel a hardware store to carry stuff in left-hand thread.
2108 2018-06-04 17:06:19 #GCL some big buys in today, in fact volume exceeded 3-month highs. US and Canadian U3O8 stocks flying this afternoon too.

2119 2018-06-04 17:01:26 @adolfo_stocks un movimiento con resultados con crecimientos de doble o triple dígito es normal que explote. En $TTD no me metí porque cuando se comentó ya ha is subido un 42% y ahí si veía yo que llegaba tarde. Pero meterme después de un 15-20% puedes pillar movimiento todavía

2122 2018-06-04 17:01:18 Yes I thought that 6 was fairly small but it depends on your stocks and the sectors (Unilever, Diageo etc should be ok).  If you had wipeouts on three of the six you are 50% down.  Buffett lots 100% in Dexter Shoes.  Probably 10 should be a minimum for conviction positions.
2123 2018-06-04 17:01:13 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
2124 2018-06-04 17:01:01 It looks that way. I think Big Divvy Stocks in general have had a change in fortunes - for example #BA. did a 50/200 day MA GX just a few days back.

2134 2018-06-04 16:58:20 I can't help thinking most people with only 6 Stocks hugely over estimate their Stock Picking ability and very difficult on small Stocks once you have a few quid.

2136 2018-06-04 16:58:08 Point is you could buy back in to $LTC and investors would be more confident in investing in the coin.

2146 2018-06-04 16:55:41 Hmm I guess that makes sense. Idk man stocks are complicated. But tbh this quality of life thing seems completely unimportant.
2147 2018-06-04 16:55:00 Hey! None of that. And I am very comfortable with my stocks as volatility is part of this market and I have invested in these great growth stocks( for at least 3 to 4 years horizon ) in which I have complete faith in as the fundamentals have only improved.
2148 2018-06-04 16:54:56 So the ten percent that own most of the stocks benefit you haven't described how the rest trickles down.

2150 2018-06-04 16:54:23 yes, because people don't know. They don't know how big/little deal it is, it's uncertainty, and that means stocks drop. It's a negative if it's true with unknown reaches into the company.

2271 2018-06-04 16:07:15 This has always been a contentious issue in my mind. A stock on 20x, growing at 30% p.a will be on the same rating in 3 years as a stock on 9x that is not growing. Value does not mean a low PE and high divi yield “expensive’ stocks can offer great value

2362 2018-06-04 15:24:25 Also, have to understand: trading options is not the same as trading stocks. Your stop on a stock may be 2%, which could equate to a 20% loss on the options contracts.

2366 2018-06-04 15:22:50 Okay. Stocks are the easiest place to start. A good portfolio will have around 30 different stocks in separate industries. This eliminates individual stock risk. 

Honestly most platforms for stocks are great. Pick the one with the fee structure you like the most.

2492 2018-06-04 14:32:29 Craig, I don't buy coal stocks and have no specific view, but problem I see with EXX is that easy target of R160 has already played out. I think it may struggle from R140.

2538 2018-06-04 14:20:20 It works quite often for individual stocks with clear signals, less so for markets. Much of the time people are trying to determine a direction when the instrument is just idling along doing nothing - fairly typical for markets in summer.

2574 2018-06-04 14:08:34 Bump stocks used once Ban them. How many of these shooters are on prescription drugs? How many were known to an authority Fed or local to be dangerous. How many should have been stopped by NICS if the authorities filled the papers. Yet its a bump stock you worry about.

2624 2018-06-04 13:55:06 $AETI 3 trading pauses this morning.  $1.79 up 141%.  That's why I love to play low float stocks like these.  High risk high reward.
2625 2018-06-04 13:54:37 PSU bank stocks, Andhra Bank (down 3%), State Bank of India (SBI) (down  1.37%), Bank of Baroda (down 4%), Canara Bank (down 0.9%), IDBI Bank  (down 4.38%), Bank of India (down 2.12%) and Union Bank of India (down  1.57%) dropped. Punjab National Bank (up 0.36%) rose.
2626 2018-06-04 13:54:24 Bank stocks declined. Among private bank stocks, HDFC Bank (down 2.99%),  Kotak Mahindra Bank (down 1.13%), ICICI Bank (down 1.14%), Axis Bank  (down 0.2%) and IndusInd Bank (down 0.93%) declined. Yes Bank (up 0.22%)  rose.
2627 2018-06-04 13:54:19 retailer that stocks anything like my size thinks designer sizes must be scaled up in all dimensions, resulting in ‘skinny’ jeans that would look snug on a pair of 25 year old oak trees. Photographers pin up the surplus material - or just scale up the size 0 model to look taller.
2628 2018-06-04 13:53:46 Ahhhh another lib that allows David Hogg to tell them what to post. Better question would be why did obama admin approve bump stocks
2629 2018-06-04 13:53:39 No real value in Bump Stocks. Please address at least one small idea that may be helpful.

2634 2018-06-04 13:52:36 I don't think stocks have feelings - if I kick one out of my portfolio for failing to make new highs over and over again, so be it!  no hard feelings
2635 2018-06-04 13:52:31 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2636 2018-06-04 13:52:07 Lets stay calm and differentiate ourself from the panic crowd.. yah stocks are down.. doesnt mean the demand is going to be reduced or the companies are going to be shutdown.. when there r downs definetly there will be ups too.. thts the mrkt nature #StayPositive 
2637 2018-06-04 13:51:34 I think it would be fiscally irresponsible right now; the crypto market is way too unstable to provide employees with consistent wages. Right now, it’s comparable to paying people in stocks and bonds.

While you’re at it, what would banning bump stocks do for anyone? Do you even know what it does?

2651 2018-06-04 13:46:14 If SEC is to regulate and control private company stocks and protect public interests, then better check a stock ticker RFL and let public know why this stock is risen from $3 to above $10 in 3 month on no news?

2653 2018-06-04 13:45:40 I'm going to be a senior in high school next year!! I support school safety and gun control 100%. But I don't think banning bump stocks is the way to go!
2654 2018-06-04 13:45:02 Particularly if you have been putting too much in stocks hyped up at prices not sustainable!   Summer turmoil or a correction of 30% or so is likely!

2656 2018-06-04 13:44:51 Stocks were NOT 20,000 under Barack. He hung around 1% GDP, Trump 3% each quarter now 4%. No contest.
2657 2018-06-04 13:44:48 select Tech and Metal stocks gained from the intra-day lows. Positive factors are  that the monsoon arrived ahead of schedule and fall in oil price from the recent high.

2673 2018-06-04 13:42:11 Sir looking at the market breadth, I feel a lot of bottom still pending. Nifty at 10628 and stocks are already damaged by 30-40%. If nifty goes to 10000, more than 30% further correction on majority of stocks will be inevitable

2686 2018-06-04 13:36:09 And look at those stocks evolution! Should have bought a few some years ago.
2687 2018-06-04 13:36:09 It would hugely benefit everyday ppl if all of this liquidity was soaked up by something of arbitrary value. Instead of pushing houses up to debt slavery levels. Or pushing stocks or bonds to the point where they give no income. This capital glut is killing the middle class
2688 2018-06-04 13:35:57 He overturned Obama's law banning bump stocks
2689 2018-06-04 13:35:57 You do know Obama legalized Bump Stocks right?

2703 2018-06-04 13:32:25 Most of the momentum stocks are developing serious health hazards. All margin funded traders' darlings are suffering from STD. Some of these might be HIV infected too. One needs to be careful. Take precautionary measures against all odds. Differentiate between STD & HIV infected.
2704 2018-06-04 13:32:20 Tariffs on Canada are more detrimental to the solar industry then tariffs on China are. Hope you bought oil stocks 15 months ago.
2705 2018-06-04 13:31:17 Agree.  It is not clear what value is  i.e. cheap near term metrics or cheap relative to intrinsic value.  Secondly, growth should be bought at a reasonable price.  Buying "cheap" stocks irrespective of growth/quality or buying growing companies irrespective of price is silly.

2732 2018-06-04 13:21:08 Actual rapid fire guns are already banned. Didn't nikolas cruz use ten round magazines. Honestly bump stocks should be banned because you can use physics to do that. All solutions have failing points in reality and at least there are people who will admit it.

2739 2018-06-04 13:15:14 Sorry, autocorrect.  Should have been 'algos'.  Computerized trading has displaced fundamental analysis and with stocks like TSLA, it's even more pronounced.  Volatility and volume begets more options trading which begets even more volume which begets more algos.
2740 2018-06-04 13:14:57 Morning Market Update: stocks are trading higher still rallying from Friday’s upbeat Job report.
2741 2018-06-04 13:14:20 Ie the bottom decile stocks do terribly and then things get progressively better as you go up the deciles. Stockopedia Stockrank system appears to be achieving similar results...
2742 2018-06-04 13:13:40 Please let there be good announcements at #WWDC because holy crap I really need the stocks to go back up.
2743 2018-06-04 13:12:37 Only thing I can figure out is that you must be shorting American stocks.
2744 2018-06-04 13:12:35 Sure, if you use a factor based approach and pick top decile stocks you could still outperform nicely whilst lowering volatility. I think Greenblatt mentions in that book that if you grade stocks on his metrics you get pretty consistent results.
2745 2018-06-04 13:11:34 Health insurance has gone up, millions lost insurance, drug prices increased, you’ve done nothing good for U.S. on this. Your announced “plan” saw insurance and pharm stocks increase, business laughs at you, seeing opportunities to increase prices more, not less.

2748 2018-06-04 13:08:08 Giles Hargreaves gets criticised for the number of stocks he has.  His argument is something like this.  There are 1,200 on AIM (a guess) and he has 10% of them.  Having about 120 means he will hold the big winners like FeverTree and therefore not miss out.

2756 2018-06-04 13:01:40 Issue in Indian market not restricted to midcaps. Even large caps stretched now. Consumer stocks at insane valuation (hiding place).

#Asset allocation is the distribution of investments among asset classes. Asset classes include different types of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

2765 2018-06-04 12:54:40 You're putting Americans in clear and present danger of a collapsing economy for your short term objective of self enrichment ? You buy into companies, then announce policies(?) that will help them. Their stocks go up and you sell. That's call insider trading, and it is criminal.

2768 2018-06-04 12:54:23 Hello Thomas, to invest in stocks in Ghana you'd need to visit a stock brokerage firm so they can make the purchases on your behalf. Also with as little as GHC 50 you can own shares in Ghana depending on the share price and minimum number of shares allowed.

2770 2018-06-04 12:53:37 Market cap weighted indices are dangerous – they provide little margin of safety, are concentrated in expensive tech stocks, and vulnerable to growth shocks.  Astoria believes diversifying across multi factor strategies is the better risk reward.

2778 2018-06-04 12:50:38 I like the analogy!  David Attenborough would be proud.  In the Magic Formula book  Greenblatt says you can have 5 or 6 stocks if they are high quality, in different sectors and you are a good stock picker.  For this to work you need to be able to avoid disasters.

2785 2018-06-04 12:47:48 Because both banning bump stocks and raising the age are waste of time ideas. Neither will fix the problem, he used his brain unlike so many others.

2789 2018-06-04 12:46:27 First, Congress has to create laws, not POTUS,. Secondly, and more importantly, Matt the hater, banning bump stocks (which can be made using a person's belt, btw) and changing the age limit would not fix the problem. Disturbed people are the problem, fix that.

2814 2018-06-04 12:37:17 True like Cyclical companies . You can make money with 3 year rotation horizon ( by calc. right entry / exit points )  These stocks should not be long term holding ..
2815 2018-06-04 12:36:55 Shitty investors have their eyes glued to the computer screen and follow every little move.   Trust your thesis and think long term and you’ll be much more successful.  Stocks go up and down especially biotech stocks.  Nobody ever made any money by panicking.
2816 2018-06-04 12:36:33 Bump stocks? Raising the age to purchase weapons to 21? 'Member those promises?

I will post all my thoughts about this in this thread and I'll be happy to hear your comments and criticism on this exercise.

2821 2018-06-04 12:34:27 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2822 2018-06-04 12:34:24 Have you ever read the constitution? You said you were going to ban bump stocks and raise the age.  More lies though.  Clearly you ae afraid of the NRA and the truth.
2823 2018-06-04 12:34:19 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2839 2018-06-04 12:25:26 Ahem... re-read the thread.  I did not "fuss" about bump-stocks.  I'm a liberal gun owner who supports 2A and feels that bans accomplish little to nothing.  Root cause mitigation, training, and safe storage requirements are a far better way to begin addressing the issue.
2840 2018-06-04 12:24:27 There's no gun show loophole, people can make makeshift bump stocks, that's already a thing (that's failure from the gov., so why give more power to it?), let's raise the age of everything else to 21 then, ie, signing leases, enlistment marriage. gender reassignment surgery, etc.
2841 2018-06-04 12:24:16 @CNN tariff s are in place , stocks go up they go down, who's in controll, look into the pockets of the politicians and the Trump family.i bet they are not empty.
2842 2018-06-04 12:22:53 That’s not what’s happening. Pharma stocks are way up. They know you’re doing nothing and expect it to continue. Your new plans are shit. You’re a charlatan.
2843 2018-06-04 12:22:41 So, we were both inaccurate. I'll admit when I'm wrong. You fussed at him for not banning bump-stocks. Since only the AG can actually issue the directive, he's done all he can do. It's up to the AG. Separation of powers, as in our Constitution. Your turn.  (Don't get so mad.)
2844 2018-06-04 12:22:02 Where's Melania? Why haven't you banned bump stocks or stood up to the NRA as promised?
2845 2018-06-04 12:21:17 Raising the age and banning bump stocks is not infringing on anyone’s rights to legally bear arms, for God’s sake. Why do you do absolutely nothing at all to curb gun violence?

2857 2018-06-04 12:17:11 It was also a requirement for the British light guns (30mm RARDEN and 76mm low velocity gun)

I assume they might even stocks of 57x348SR ammo left from the S-60 AA-guns. those HE and APHE rounds are a definite step up from the 30mm guns now in use. They do need APDSFS though..
2858 2018-06-04 12:16:52 Correct.  That is not "banned bump stocks", as you previously stated.
2859 2018-06-04 12:16:16 For one: we all have different ideas of what will advance our society in the best way.  Some things about your party strike me as very appealing and then I see most call for legal bump stocks and I think it’s short sighted.

2864 2018-06-04 12:13:53 James, Did you just make a big deal selling stocks? Congrats. Stock prices are only one economic indicator.
2865 2018-06-04 12:13:01 It’s not infringement to impose restrictions.  Bump stocks aren’t guns, they’re a component that turns a semi auto into a potentially already restricted gun. Increasing age restriction for purchase and ownership of a weapon that can kill many people is a reasonable ask.
2866 2018-06-04 12:11:47 Banning bump stocks and raising the age limit does not mean people do not have "sufficient" arms. It does not mean people of any age should have whatever type of weapons known to man that exists now or may be created in the future, without any limits or controls whatsoever.
2867 2018-06-04 12:10:57 Man what are talking about bump stocks. Do you know what it take to make an automatic weapon. It ain't just the bump-stock! STOP LISTNING TO THE IDOTS ON CAPITAL LINE HILL IN DC!
2868 2018-06-04 12:10:50 Oh Matt, who the Fuq cares??? You really think bump stocks are the key? Or 21 is magical? You don’t pay attention much to the data, just bloviating to be a lib.
2869 2018-06-04 12:09:53 Banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21 will do absolutely nothing. That is symbolism over substance. #AndrewPollock has laid out some very common sense reforms that will help curb ALL violence, but liberals don’t want that. Why? Because they want to ban guns.

2885 2018-06-04 12:05:24 Agreed. Customer service (and adviser service) are (anecdotally) at all time lows. Problem after problem needing to be addressed. More and more time sorting issues out for the client rather than focussing on more technical / advisory matters.
2886 2018-06-04 12:04:10 Army should absolutely upgrade their Wildcats from the world's worst troop transport to a very decent attack helicopter.

It can make use of existing weapons stocks like Brimstone, for one thing.

2888 2018-06-04 12:03:44 And where's the ban on bump stocks?  Raise purchase age to 21? Ban assault style weapons? Universal background checks? Other reasonable measures to end gun violence?  Your silence is deafening, bigly.

2894 2018-06-04 12:02:33 Might have to wait for stocks to open before a deal like that can be announced? IIRC the Xamarin purchase wasn't announced until mid-afternoon UK time even though the news started spreading that morning

Just because few stocks are expensive, doesn’t mean they are not worth a buy. Similarly, a cheap stock doesn’t guarantee wealth creation.

2918 2018-06-04 11:47:53 Horrendously rough days. The midcap carnage is on. There's some serious regulatory action on margins and surveillance that's bust a lot of speculative bubbles - and taken good stocks with it too.
2919 2018-06-04 11:47:43 People get mad cuz he does what he wants but also gets mad for trying to follow the constitution that all are held under.  There are other solutions to gun violence than banning bump stocks. Maybe people could simply stop being violent,  that would be nice
2920 2018-06-04 11:46:07 This feels like more of a supply issue - not as many stocks left to buy so they just buy everything
2921 2018-06-04 11:45:24 these stocks should go to bankruptcy valuations.. people still want 2 buy these... and SIP money is not stopping... 

so the pain continues

** Nikkei rises more than 300 points as rest of Asia gains after US jobs report

** European markets higher as utility stocks lead gains; Air France KLM soars 7%
2929 2018-06-04 11:43:12 There is no loophole at gun shows. Dealers still require a background check no matter where they sell the gun.
Bump stocks have been used in only one mass shooting which likely would have been just as deadly without them so banning them solves nothing.

2935 2018-06-04 11:40:07 Bump stocks are not a part of the NRA? It’s a accessory for a gun. Along with millions of other accessors in the world. If you ban bump stock someone will invent another legal version anyway most likely.
2936 2018-06-04 11:40:06 The constitution has nothing to do with raising the age limit of gun buyers and banning bump stocks.
2937 2018-06-04 11:38:44 You do know bump stocks were before Congress during the Obama administration and never got banned right.
2938 2018-06-04 11:38:18 You’re a liar...you’re NOT the greatest president ever! #posprez & Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? #posprez

2943 2018-06-04 11:33:34 When stocks or coins go up it's short covering.

When they go down it's always manipulation or market makers playing games.

3000 2018-06-04 10:50:09 Thanks, other than crypto interested to buy emerging stock market index if a global stock market correction happens. Think stocks will go up a lot more over the next decade, but emerging markets underperformed past 10 years and typically overperform at the end of the stock cycle.
3001 2018-06-04 10:48:39 #stocks The most interesting investments are those that are at the same time undervalued and trending up. Do commodities fit into this category?

3044 2018-06-04 09:55:46 The presumption typically is that diversification reduces risk but can increase your performance.  Less stocks allows you to concentrate on the best ideas.  However, if you don't know which specific stocks will do well then having more stocks with good characteristics may help.
3045 2018-06-04 09:54:42 Interesting to think about Venture Capital and also Giles Hargreaves.  In VC investing it is one or two investments that allow you to do well.  Giles Hargreaves has lots of stocks as this helps buy into some of the big winners.  So more stocks can potentially help perform well.

3132 2018-06-04 08:49:23 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

3134 2018-06-04 08:45:09 People thought the same when Pharma Stocks were heavy weights in Nifty some years ago. Honestly speaking from experience, no stock or sector can hold the Index to ransom.Every rise and fall finds its leaders.

3155 2018-06-04 08:30:01 3 That this is the case in NO way changes the capacity of Govt to spend on public services. The spending comes first. Money grows on Govt, not on rich people. Austerity is a political ideology, a means of increasing flows of money to rich people, adding to their stocks of wealth.

3162 2018-06-04 08:24:04 1 Flows of money via govt spending lead to flows of money to tax revenues as the money is transacted around the economy. It also leads to flows of money to savings, adding to stocks of savings. If tax flows are less than govt spending flows in any accounting period, then...

3200 2018-06-04 07:53:28 My point is not limited to the stocks listed here and you may be right about Jet airways, the whole point is if there is a lot of intraday interest in a stock, they are not best candidates for buy and forget. #ValueInvesting

3202 2018-06-04 07:50:45 I would not think human disturbance is a big issue here but declining fish stocks may also contribute, so we're likely seeing direct (over-fishing) and indirect (climate change) impacts.

3215 2018-06-04 07:34:30 A long term investor should be happy, when there is this type of mood. I have observed over the years, these are often great times to pick your carefully selected stocks and add them slowly and on every fall.

These times test your conviction, temperament.

3221 2018-06-04 07:28:57 Hi, we always recommend to have a long term investing approach when one invests in the equity market. Currently, some stocks which we own in DSPBR Small Cap Fund are in the consolidation phase due to slow business momentum currently, which has hurt our performance... (1)

3251 2018-06-04 07:00:29 There are many reasons Media Stocks are flat/down. One of them is most Investors feel as targeted by Sports Media for scorn & ridicule as any FOXNews Regular Viewer. Most haven't dumped their Shares. But there's not much new Buying. Not until they see some cnages.
3252 2018-06-04 07:00:08 #myn Eddie Gonzalez, "monetisation of the gas discovery at the Morris #1 Well at the Stockdale Field is a bonus for the Company... revenue is expected to result in a rapid payback... further development work planned... excellent opportunity to create an additional revenue stream"

3255 2018-06-04 06:54:41 Thanks! Of course the bottom half may outperform. After writing the list/article it struck me that the stocks towards the bottom are generally value plays and the top ones have a more of a growth bias. Maybe my bias towards growth stocks will be misplaced.

3312 2018-06-04 06:09:12 Politics isn’t about smart vs stupid. Most people care about the truth, and I’m definitely not trying to violate someone’s rights. But if a ban on bump stocks violates your rights, why doesn’t the machine gun ban?
If banning weapons doesn’t work, why do we ban grenades?
3313 2018-06-04 06:08:09 The ar-15 uses a 5.56 or .223 it's the equilivant to a 22 In mass as for bump stocks they are stupid but I've seen illegal mods with a penny that can do the same.
3314 2018-06-04 06:06:56 I’ve changed my options strategy over the past year, which tends to lean away from high volatility as they tend to be riskier. Focused on low risk high reward type plays but have come across many high beta stocks that just happen to currently have low IV and trading at a discount
3315 2018-06-04 06:06:13 but now only momentum stocks are falling not the good one yet,  no panic in quality stocks unlike demon  where everything had fallen.

3320 2018-06-04 06:02:51 Asian stocks traded higher on Monday, tracking gains seen on Wall Street after Friday's expectation-topping U.S. jobs report and shrugging off related concerns.Sensex was at 35217 down by 14 points or by 0.03%, while the NSE Nifty was at 10686 down by 9.90 points or by 0.09%.
3321 2018-06-04 06:02:31 Banning them in 1985 probably would have. Not that I’m saying ban all guns. Banning bump stocks definitely would have saved lives. Banning rounds with that much velocity and mass would have saved lives. We already have laws banning machine guns. They appear to be working.

3333 2018-06-04 05:49:18 - Closing loopholes at gunshows

- raising the age to purchase to 21

3386 2018-06-04 05:11:19 I am nobody to comment on your investments. It is your decision on what you want to do. If you can absorb these losses, knowing for sure that the stocks that you hold are bad, then you need to sell. If you think that stocks you have are good & will recover, then you need to hold.

Refer $ADO as an example.
3391 2018-06-04 05:07:33 Another way: anti-regressive taxation. Eg, stop preferential taxation of cap gains (after indexing for inflation).

I.e., equal opportunity—taxing those who invest themselves—working on degrees, personal startups, etc—at same rate as the wealthy who buy buildings or stocks

U.S. stocks rallied fell as the latest jobs data bolstered optimism in the economy, all but solidifying a rate hike later this month.

3517 2018-06-04 03:22:34 And who's fault I'd that?   NRA.   Trump said he'd raise age to own and ban bump stocks....then the NRA had a chat with him.

3625 2018-06-04 01:45:19 Don't ban bump stocks.  I wonder if you will count this one?
3626 2018-06-04 01:43:34 That was really special of Jimmy Fallon, and yes...Trump should have done something....like ban on bump stocks as graduation present!!! But alas, he's a non-starter who can't really read, so best he stay away.
3627 2018-06-04 01:43:21 Please keep up the fight. Bump stocks need to be banned from public use.
3628 2018-06-04 01:42:48 One question you never answer do you only invest in stocks or you have invested in MF's too sir.
3629 2018-06-04 01:42:32 I tried looking for it too. Apparently Big W stocks them but you need to order it in.

3633 2018-06-04 01:38:16 You may be right; hard to predict for sure. Many of these companies have has that kind of growth in share price already so now people need to be more discerning with pot stocks. Not all of them are gold.

3636 2018-06-04 01:34:31 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? #posprez
3637 2018-06-04 01:34:01 That is what his financial adviser did with bio fuel stocks. Cohn. He is still being "onvestigated" by GOP. He wrote the EO that Trump signed and made a cool 700 mil. by selling his stocks short. They will never find him guilty though because Trump.

3645 2018-06-04 01:28:27 Yeah is it really that bad to have gun laws that ban bump stocks (Which makes guns automatic) and raise the minimum age to buy, own a gun to 21 and background checks. It’s like seriously why is so hard to impose just this!?

3650 2018-06-04 01:24:41 Short %:  To put the UEC Short position into perspective; on 5/17 it was 7.99% vs 8.31% today.  It is 2x-4x other U3O8 stocks such as UUUU, URG, DNN, & CCJ. Interestingly, in a few weeks it increased quite a bit while URA was selling heavily but the stock is still up strong.

3657 2018-06-04 01:18:48 look, "jeff bezos doesn't actually have $135 B in cash, that's just his worth via stocks" doesn't actually negate the fundamental illegitimacy of his wealth. literally admitting that stocks--a major underpinning of the capitalist economy--are based on fantasy doesn't help you.
3658 2018-06-04 01:18:07 Well, Congress will stop any attempt to rollback assault rifles or bump stocks. All bought by the NRA.  Are your Cons the rich? rural? Who are they?  Ours are undereducated evangelicals.
3659 2018-06-04 01:15:33 It has been hard to find a kinase inhibitor "not" targeting Ret. Quite a few of them have been approved, with "Ret side effect". Most "multi-kinase" inhibitors hit Ret with great potency. It just happened that Loxo went through the trials.  great for the stocks though.

3662 2018-06-04 01:13:24 @realDonaldTrump isn't afraid of the #NRA .... He'll ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase to 21 ....    Politicians are afraid of the NRA, not him....

3663 2018-06-04 01:11:49 1/ The tax "reform" was beneficial primarily to foreign owners of US stocks and to extremely wealthy people of any nationality. Neither group is a high priority for me. Since you seem not to realize this, we probably shouldn't discuss economics at all.
3664 2018-06-04 01:10:09 What do I do with the other 4 must own stocks you suggested.....that are all down ? Just sayin’
3665 2018-06-04 01:09:18 I submitted my comment on banning bump stocks. Hope everybody else does to. 
Congratulations on high School graduation. Do proud of all of you.

3672 2018-06-04 00:58:18 @RyanAFournier When Trump met with the students he floated many ideas on controlling bump stocks, semi-automatics etc. After a clandestine meeting with the NRA, he backpedaled on everything he said. Is that honorable for a president?
3673 2018-06-04 00:58:12 Invest in foreign steel but not domestic steel. Drumpf will repeal the tariffs once his advisors remind him of basic economics. Invest in stocks from airplane manufacturers and other luxury goods and set it so that if it drops 10.1% in 2 days, you autosell it.

3688 2018-06-04 00:49:44 Two main reasons:
1- They're not strong enough. They rolled over on full auto, & they're doing it again with bump stocks. They're unreliable

2. They only support gun rights for white people. Philando Castile was murdered by the state for legally carrying, & they defended the cop

3712 2018-06-04 00:32:22 Idk ARE we still a free market system? With Trump tanking stocks of private companies on a whim ie. Amazon, Boeing, Lockheed? Not to mention announcing the highly confidential jobs numbers before the stock market opened.

There is no ban on bump stocks...
There is no federal law raising gun purchase ages.
