10 2018-11-07 23:58:27 Honestly, I go through so much olive oil in my house we need it on fucking tap.

17 2018-11-07 23:57:28 There's no denying oil & gas is an important industry and even 22 years from now it will still be needed, for plastics, roads, etc. But like others say, it is a finite resource. Its just like VHS and telephone operators, the tech and its use evolves. Same will happen to oil & gas

40 2018-11-07 23:56:54 agree, tho oil is bringing the surplus down ever so slightly in the latest monthly CA data.  tis still huge tho
41 2018-11-07 23:56:50 Palm oil NEEDS to be banned - animals need to be protected as well as people, land, air, and water - clean energy and technologies should be encouraged and sponsored - if we do not change with times, we all lose

47 2018-11-07 23:55:32 @realDonaldTrump Please do something about the rising fuel cost, if there is a great supply of oil then why are the prices so high. Maybe you need to regulate the oil industry, it’s always been a consumer gouging industry

74 2018-11-07 23:52:07 Texas is a main producer for oil with a republican in office they wouldn’t allow taxing it. All in all it’s money Over politics. If someone is about to lose billions over a DEM in office I’m sure they’ll do whatever they have in power to prevent that.

93 2018-11-07 23:48:39 Balling my teary eyes out of this damn AC. I can hardly even open it and this AC is not helping at all. Thank goodness this mokosoi oil is camouflaging all my kani 
94 2018-11-07 23:48:25 I use the topical cream all the time for chronic pain and it is a lifesaver. I've tried the oil (both as a straight oil and a capsule) and never really noticed any results, but there could be so many reasons for that.

101 2018-11-07 23:47:50 Something told me to check the oil.  I found a radiator hose ballooning.  My neighbor took me to auto zone to get the part.  I fixed it myself in no time and was back in business without a dumb mechanic ear hustling me.  #grownman
102 2018-11-07 23:47:48 Current Governor actively ATTACKED: 

1) local land-use authority over oil and gas (that is exercised over all other activities); and 

2) ensuring that operations protect public health, safety, and environment. 

Hick sided w/ balancing people & protections against profits.
103 2018-11-07 23:47:41 hey there twitter, it’s me again, dipping my thumb in burning oil because apparently I don’t have enough pain in my life already
104 2018-11-07 23:47:13 The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia and now produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world.
105 2018-11-07 23:47:09 Interesting! I had the oil and it made me so dizzy, then I tried the higher dose gummies and I was instantly flushed/throwing up/twitching/a total mess. Glad I'm not alone! I really thought I was.

107 2018-11-07 23:46:50 I can’t imagine a life without palm oil, sumbara, cray fish, and pepper. I don’t want to ever know such an existence.
108 2018-11-07 23:46:39 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
109 2018-11-07 23:46:27 Except for the part where you can miss that main story Mission pouring forth oil II

111 2018-11-07 23:46:02 One time i gave a guy a massage for 10 mins and then when it was my turn he did it for a minute and then stopped because he said it was “too hard without massage oil”. I still think about it and it still pisses me off.

113 2018-11-07 23:45:40 Every frozen potato product that I have seen in every grocery store contains cottonseed oil.  This should never be inserted into food. The toxins from all the pesticides are said to concentrate in the seeds.

119 2018-11-07 23:44:54 Watching OPEC mull over a cut to tide the recent plunge in oil however !
120 2018-11-07 23:44:49 Our economic managers pretend these challenges don't exist. I already forsee fiscal dooms day before  May 2019. Warning signs already there. CBN has already reported oil revenue shortfalls for first half of 2018.
121 2018-11-07 23:44:37 Costco, your home for free cheese samples and bulk Olive oil, reports a strong same store sales number, but sees slowing growth in e-commerce
122 2018-11-07 23:44:21 What’s the difference? If I buy oil at $50 a barrel then at minimum it’s a fluctuating store of value. I may have reasons to think its price would increase with little chance of going to, say, $10/barrel so I decide it’s not a bad risk to store some of my own value there.
123 2018-11-07 23:44:08 Yo. Anyone know if coconut oil works as lip balm bc I have lost my lip balm and Vaseline and my lips are going to fall off my fave
124 2018-11-07 23:44:01 @MyBurger21 how would I find out what oil is used to cook your French fries?  Also, from an allergy standpoint, Do you disclose the other ingredients?
125 2018-11-07 23:43:59 Rub a little Coconut oil and brush it through with the baby brush to keep it from flaking up!
126 2018-11-07 23:43:53 The guy where I get my oil changed always remembers me and tells every person there to be nice to me and I just genuinely enjoy people treating me like a human at a car dealership.
127 2018-11-07 23:43:27 Omg did it really?! Thx! I was gunna try castor oil if the serum didn’t work but maybe I’ll do both!

130 2018-11-07 23:43:09 The fact that i gotta get my oil changed, brakes changed & tires rotated next week is beyond me 
131 2018-11-07 23:43:07 Watching a S2 Good Place:

Michael: "When the change oil light came on in your car you abandoned it in a parking garage."

Kristen Bell's delivery there is incredible.

133 2018-11-07 23:42:49 Big petroleum on both sides BP & Chevron. It would benefit the oil companies by widening the carbon offset market for them. So many of the dirtiest industries would have been exempt. The fear factor campaign of "petroleum is spending millions against it!' didn't work thankfully.
134 2018-11-07 23:42:36 Getting a oil change tomorrow 
135 2018-11-07 23:42:28 What to do when you just learned that McDonald's fries is cooked with beef oil but your Buddhist vegetarian grandma since forever has been eating them for decades?
136 2018-11-07 23:42:17 Be to was a teenage thug who a judge gave an ultimatum to go to jail or go to boarding school. Then, he was caught trespassing and was arrested. He has DWI. 
One of his platforms was to tax each barrel of Texas produced oil $10 which would basicly shut down that industry in Texas
137 2018-11-07 23:42:16 My room smells like eucalyptus and tea tree oil 
138 2018-11-07 23:41:58 No!!! They make Cbd oil & tinctures specifically for dogs !!
139 2018-11-07 23:41:56 CBD oil works well for lots of folks
140 2018-11-07 23:41:53 @RockstarGames you guys need to make pouring forth oil a replay able mission on the list if you missed it. Just put it in the progress replay list. This is #1 bullshit.
141 2018-11-07 23:41:34 accepted norms. you are so cute. breaking the law itself is more like it. like he always said, do what you want and apologize later. what are they going to do, put the oil back into the ground? he actually told a band of Native folks that. before his coup.
142 2018-11-07 23:41:33 Don’t get me wrong, I used to vote straight Dem every time, but after hearing Beto say a “fuck” bomb last night, I’ve woken up. I’ll be voting for sentient guns, oil spills and racist Twitter bots for the rest of my life. I didn’t leave my party, they left me!
143 2018-11-07 23:41:23 Too many "coaching" profiteers and demo "producers". I've had students crying in my studio when they realized they had pissed away $1,000+ on snake oil salesmen and empty promises. There are also a lot of talented people who become become discouraged by sheisters. Buyer beware!
144 2018-11-07 23:41:19 We are like oil and water, we’ve been trying to mix it up 
145 2018-11-07 23:40:45 Texas worship oil because so many jobs tied directly or indirectly.  Cruz ran an add saying Beto would add a $10.00/barrel tax on oil.  Feds don't tax oil at the well, and not what Beto proposed.  GOP lie.
146 2018-11-07 23:40:44 Canned tuna packed in oil always helps Mac, if you'd be inclined to try.  Won't hurt him if he won't eat it, but might help him if he will. Just a spoon or 2. Mac gets a hairball every few months or so and never had to go to the vet for it. Just trying to be helpful! 
147 2018-11-07 23:40:34 Not both support profit over people, big oil, or big pharma 

Good try but "both sides-ism" doesnt work anymore bro
148 2018-11-07 23:40:34 a ban on offshore oil drilling?
149 2018-11-07 23:40:32 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
150 2018-11-07 23:40:13 Thats right because the further objective of the NATO invasion of irak and Afganistán were to isolate Iran from Syria and China the two allieds who can conduce to world market iranian oil in case of a naval blockade on Ormuz passage
151 2018-11-07 23:39:56 Vegetable oil is really just an Bangali thing
152 2018-11-07 23:39:54 Really good news take #carbontax from big oil #exxonmobil
153 2018-11-07 23:39:52 “Oil change department please” .. okay so service.

155 2018-11-07 23:39:49 Do any of y’all use CBD oil for anxiety, depression, and/or chronic pain? I’m thinking of getting some but idk where to even start
156 2018-11-07 23:39:48 I follow everyone furthering the XRP ecosystem. I understand that the usage and demand of XRP will increase in direct relation to breadth of this ecosystem. If I owned barrels of oil, I would probably be interested auto industry trends and gov emissions laws.
157 2018-11-07 23:39:43 @RockstarSupport you guys really need to make the mission pouring forth oil II replayable if you miss it. I'm just put it on the fucking replay list how hard is it.
158 2018-11-07 23:39:33 Namiji .... 45^
159 2018-11-07 23:39:26 No I’m talking about oil changes and shit but I mean if you wanna do that that’s you im just looking out for you and your credit
160 2018-11-07 23:39:14 I've started using Bliss for cleansing and exfoliating and then toner, I'm stuck trying to find a toner because the last one I had gave me a reaction. And then I put vitamin E oil and after all that, Cetaphil moisturizer.
161 2018-11-07 23:38:26 Try a spoon or 2 of canned tuna packed in oil.  It should help him cough it up.  It won't hurt him.  At least every few months Mac gets hairballs.
162 2018-11-07 23:38:23 J B Pritzker - D just did this in Illinois and Dem centrists loved it. Nothing like electing an oil corp owner who is bringing a fossil fuel pipeline to this state in a time of irreversible climate change.
163 2018-11-07 23:38:20 A dealership service department works like this: if you get an oil change from any place other than them, automatically it’s aftermarket oil and they void all warranties you have 
164 2018-11-07 23:38:07 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."

168 2018-11-07 23:37:43 8 yrs. of education cuts, healthcare cuts, cuts to infrastructure and revenue shortfalls due to tax giveaways to oil & gas, Okla. voters elected another hard right conservative just like Gov.Fallon. Okla. freefall continues. Nice.

174 2018-11-07 23:37:02 Even better if Justin and rest of the Lib-Con Big Oil puppets were in the picture together. The corporate media’s agenda to manufacture a difference between the Lib-Con has reached the pathetic stage.
175 2018-11-07 23:37:00 Kindness is the oil that takes the friction out of life.
176 2018-11-07 23:36:45 Carbon is essential for life, so I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty of fertilizing your lawn with a barrel of crude oil while you were out extolling the virtues of CO2. You're welcome! #cdnpoli
177 2018-11-07 23:36:34 Also, these NOCs tend to keep noncore assets, which could be much better managed by others. Pareto’s principle all over. 25/600 fields in  produce 80% of the oil. 99.9% owned by @Pemex. @petrobras doing the right thing w the divestment program in Campos.

179 2018-11-07 23:36:16 I don’t buy barrels of oil and expect that Exxon or BP owe me something.
180 2018-11-07 23:36:10 Well, that was what made it even funnier. One by one, the ingredients for baking... flour (no dramatic burst bags), some kind of cooking oil, small tin foil pie holders. It was like driving around a strange baking assault course. No eggs though- that would’ve been cracking! 
181 2018-11-07 23:35:52 Bro to do your own oil change after buying filter and oil it’s almost $20 might as well pay someone else for $20 lmao

186 2018-11-07 23:35:27 57% of #Denver voters supported #safersetbacks, Prop. 112.  Good thing too. The potential #oilandgas drilling right near @MayorHancock's home in NE Denver likely come before the CO Oil & Gas "Conservation" Commission in next couple of months.  @ColoradoRising #copolitics
187 2018-11-07 23:35:21 correct..in my opinion...just not about b/e you have to show a profit, in addition, these guys are still paying off loans from the last oil rout

189 2018-11-07 23:34:43 Bro if you cant or don’t know how to change a tire, check your oil, or your coolant, you’re a waste of a human js
190 2018-11-07 23:34:28 Wait. People are “resisting” Justin’s pathetic plan to not even cone close to meeting Harper’s carbon reduction targets? Why aren’t they thanking him? Big oil puppets should stick together.

201 2018-11-07 23:32:38 So Manchester City owners have allegedly been fiddling the books, inflating crowd numbers, cheating Fair play rules and attracting miraculous sponsorship deals from mystery sources and using massive oil wealth to purchase success. No surprise there then!!
Cash can’t buy class
202 2018-11-07 23:32:26 They want to believe there's a saviour, and he is being sold as one, not least of all by himself.

True, these people are the ones buying the snake oil, but they're also the victims of the scam. /

204 2018-11-07 23:32:19 On the bright side, the Dean of the House is Don Young, who has compared gay relations to bulls having sex. He also doesn't believe in town halls, is pro drilling for oil in the Arctic, and also once used the term "w*tbacks" in a radio interview.
205 2018-11-07 23:32:13 Also if you are cooking add a little bit of oil to everything - not bad oils though. My friend is 95 lbs and has IBS so her diet is super restricted and she has been trying to gain weight for a couple years now - this is what's working best for her. & not butter.
206 2018-11-07 23:32:06 I think @bukolasaraki is dire need a jumbo cash for self aggrandizement again. You couldn't address this in your 8 (+8 in proxy) wasteful yrs in Kwara state with less population in the oil boom period. Your own charity doesn't begin from home I guess

211 2018-11-07 23:31:48 Well if big oil would make a commitment to the exclusive utilization of the #OneTrueAlphaPowerSource  it would make a drastic impact on #ClimateChange and start changing things for the better making the world a more hospitable environment.

224 2018-11-07 23:29:46 My dad worked in the oil industry; now retired. No problem there, but now he's occasionally mentoring people starting out in the same line of work and *that* makes me uncomfortable. (Haven't watched the video.)
225 2018-11-07 23:29:41 Several years ago I had good results w #CBD Oil {#Cannabidiol Extract or Isolate).
However, due to the recent explosion of new #Cannabis processors hungering for market share, I've noticed that it's become less effective, overpriced & misregulated.

Caveat Emptor = Buyer Beware
226 2018-11-07 23:29:36 Is it me or does my car sound healthier after an oil change

228 2018-11-07 23:29:06 To be honest you have to change your lotions and body soap. Daniel has eczema and he uses aveeno body soap and lotion. It’s works PERFECT! But use coconut oil, exfoliating body soap. Try to use non scented

242 2018-11-07 23:27:37 @PatKessler Plenty of us were sick of @RepErikPaulsen - He is not a nice guy.  He kept backpedaling away from him voting record in election season.  He wouldn't meet his constituents.  He is not moderate.  He is a snake oil salesmen. Just because he smiled doesnt make him good.
243 2018-11-07 23:27:35 Synthetic in a newer vehicle. I see it all the time. People come into the shop and ask for an oil change but don’t want to pay for synthetic oil, then when something goes wrong with they’re vehicle, the warranty is voided because they didn’t use the manufacture recommended oil
244 2018-11-07 23:27:27 Trump is more transparent than used neutrogena. Snake oil salesman always are to intelligent people
245 2018-11-07 23:27:02 I bet they will also have oil platforms surrounding us w/the exception of the wealthiest communities.  I had to buy a water purifier because I didn't trust the water. The algae has to be due to climate change. It's totally gross!
You left out tornado's.
246 2018-11-07 23:27:01 If government usa wants damage to tanker oil from iran will give hard to answer
247 2018-11-07 23:26:51 Agree. Entire oil/gas sector is ideologically-driven and hopelessly compromised. NZ needs to establish a national policy going forward without the bullshit and noise from such businesses/groups.

Evidence the propaganda continually spouted by @nzenergyvoices what a load of crap.
248 2018-11-07 23:26:40 Fucked up by adding EV Olive Oil to my guacamole  I’m all trying to be healthy& that shit made me gag! I couldn’t take the smell those were good ass avocados... 
249 2018-11-07 23:26:25 Sorry for the delay in replying. Yes it's like this. Sardines in oil, butter or the special hairball paste. My cat doesn't like the paste so l put it on her paw & she picks it off. Keep us posted.

That is the hour you find out how riotously screwed Big Oil is.
257 2018-11-07 23:25:43 Lots of oils and nuts for extra calories. If you eat a salad put a TON of olive oil in it. Eat Mac nuts for snacks. You can make smoothies that have avocado almond butter and yogurt/ milk.
258 2018-11-07 23:25:40 No snake oil 4 me.
259 2018-11-07 23:25:40 I don’t know why you people continue to engage this Mutisi guy! I keep reminding you that this is the same guy who, after we started having cooking oil shortages, accused Zimbos of loving cooking oil too much unlike South Africans. Do you really think the guy is sane?
260 2018-11-07 23:25:39 So let me get this straight - Two corporate parties that almost universally support war, militarism, Wall Street exploitation, profit over people, big pharma, big oil, & big ag went up against each other yesterday? 

And who won??
261 2018-11-07 23:25:36 It's not all that often you have olive oil leaking out of your ears. It's nothing to do with my Greek heritage, honest!

264 2018-11-07 23:25:17 They make an essential oil/cbd blend for anxiety. It’s in a roll on tube!
265 2018-11-07 23:25:14 @realDonaldTrump Help save the Environment, take OIL out of plastic making & replace it with HEMP . A win/ win, its biodegradable.
266 2018-11-07 23:25:07 Cool.  Did you use a filter to make it look like an oil painting?
267 2018-11-07 23:25:04 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
268 2018-11-07 23:24:57 What oil
269 2018-11-07 23:24:55 So I had some dry skin and I dont own any lotion.  I decided on coconut oil instead. Now max will not stop licking me. Is this a thing or is he a weirdo???
270 2018-11-07 23:24:54 i use baby oil and brush it into his hair with those soft baby brushes after his bath:)

278 2018-11-07 23:24:03 The greens are good sauteed with garlic and olive oil.
279 2018-11-07 23:23:53 It's fun to message your friends online at night in your time zone and say "Burnin' some of that midnight oil huh" and then just close the window and stop responding
280 2018-11-07 23:23:52 The only thing I don’t use olive oil for when cooking is high temperature pan searing.
281 2018-11-07 23:23:46 We hope you are loving this incredible Essential oil!
282 2018-11-07 23:23:37 That is why the Venezuelan president is having a problem. The spoiled liberals who were coddled by oil $ went against him when oil prices went down and he could not give them free stuff anymore. So they became ungovernable, formed a resistance, and the world calls him a dictator.

286 2018-11-07 23:23:03 No just straight coconut oil. I will switch to sesame oil every now and then but primarily just 20 mins when I wake up and 20 mins early evening with Coconut oil.
287 2018-11-07 23:23:03 Pro tip y’all boys: 

Put an unscented moisturizer on your neck preferably an essential oil (argan, almond, etc..) THEN put the cologne on. It’ll last longer. Thank me later
288 2018-11-07 23:23:01 Florida may not have the governor many were hoping for, but we did manage to ban offshore oil drilling, dog racing, and indoor vaping! Anyone who liked to vape while watching dog races and drilling for oil offshore is feeling pretty sick right now. #ElectionResults2018
289 2018-11-07 23:22:49 Dude, YOU are clueless....   some of those FireTrucks have NO AC , Bad Breaks , Oil Leaks and Water Tank Leaks....   This mayor is INCOMPETENT!
290 2018-11-07 23:22:47 I was concerned initially as well but do what @Type1Hurdles does. I went for a full on mud rasal treatment last time! Ok at the time but with all the oil my set just peeled off during the night. Will take spare next time! Steam/sauna seems to be ok
291 2018-11-07 23:22:42 Yes, you have to protect those oil fields no matter who dies or how many you kill, cause it's all about illegally stealing the oil
292 2018-11-07 23:22:42 See WSJ for January 20th, 2017. The price of oil was $53.00. You don't get credit for bringing the price of oil down a little when you drove it up a lot.
293 2018-11-07 23:22:37 *Dude pays $200 for oil changes
294 2018-11-07 23:22:34 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
295 2018-11-07 23:22:30 Your following tweet is asking folk to sign petition to "evict big oil". You want more parking & loading bays (hint: shopkeepers routinely, vastly overestimate importance of car parking). But also an end to big oil?!...
296 2018-11-07 23:22:18 @pepboysauto dropped my car off for an oil change at 12pm. Now 6:20pm still havent done my oil change. Good thing I called to check on it. Horrible customer service.
297 2018-11-07 23:21:59 Perfectly safe. Nothing to see here. 

Trading our health and safety for oil companies profits.
298 2018-11-07 23:21:48 Happy Thursday, see you later with our not to be missed special fragrant meal - Blue Pea Nasi Lemak with Organic Coconut Oil, served with home made  sambal (特色蓝花有机椰油糙米饭配自制参巴酱)

304 2018-11-07 23:21:04 The more animal protections he removes frees up their (animals) habitat for oil drilling and fracking.
305 2018-11-07 23:21:01 “oh you in the oil field” 
306 2018-11-07 23:20:54 I use peppermint oil on hayzens feet & spine when he has a fever. Ever 30/50 min till it’s gone. & for cough/congestion turn on shower super hot & let them room get steamy & sit with him + a humidifier in there!
307 2018-11-07 23:20:52 I mean peppermint leaves I’m not sure about oil! And if he’s still in a crib use a hot pot beside the crib, if not take him into the bathroom and play with him while a hot shower fills the room with steam
308 2018-11-07 23:20:51 This ulta lip oil is bombbbb af 
309 2018-11-07 23:20:49 Also, DRINKERS PAY ATTN!!! OIL PULLING KILLS HANGOVERS!!! WOKE UP AFTER A BINGE NIGHT,  OIL PULL FOR 20 MINS WITH COCONUT, OLIVE OR SESAME OIL AND VOILA YOUR HANGOVER IS GONE. #YoureWelcome
310 2018-11-07 23:20:49 This is 50% of the awesome news that we're waiting for. Now, once Purfarma closes, we can start making oil :)
311 2018-11-07 23:20:46 لاحول ولاقوة الا بالله .. و حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل
312 2018-11-07 23:20:35 Just opened up the bottle of olive oil and took a big gulp thinking it was water then spit it out....it’s been a day. #happyhumpday
313 2018-11-07 23:20:30 I usually roast them with seasoning on the grill w olive oil or under the broiler.
314 2018-11-07 23:20:30 Yes, end generally wrong, specially in the oil accounting now that plus or Minos one tanker could be a 2 MMBBL mistake !
315 2018-11-07 23:20:27 
316 2018-11-07 23:20:25 So I went to @autozone to buy some engine oil and the cashier deadass donated money from my card without even letting me know lol. She deadass was pressing all the buttons on the credit card reader without even letting me see them.
317 2018-11-07 23:20:11 This is the one time I wish we were owned by some Arabic oil lord like man city

319 2018-11-07 23:20:00 All I can say is enjoy it whilst it lasts sooner or later you will be clamped down on for cheating FFP and the owners will be get bored of their toy football club and back to mid table your go before they arrived and pumped 1.4 billion of Arab oil money into the plastic club 
320 2018-11-07 23:19:57 Oil Can Harry’ssssssssss
321 2018-11-07 23:19:51 Oh no, they found oil in your mouth?!
322 2018-11-07 23:19:40 y empresas enormes como FORD, BAYER y la ESTANDARD OIL colaborando con hitler para lucrar con mano de obra basicamente regalada y forzada salida de los judios, españoles y rojos metidos en los campos de concentracion es comunismo ???? "mamita querida..."
323 2018-11-07 23:19:34 But the oil patch is cleaning up after themselves just fine. What’s her real issue?
324 2018-11-07 23:19:32 In some contexts, “all of the above” is appropriate. And all of the below: rationing to prevent hoarding of fossil fuels; destruction of an oil company to prevent a glut of fossil fuels.
325 2018-11-07 23:19:20 depends on the stuff. corn oil and stuff, yeah.
326 2018-11-07 23:19:19 eat coconut oil w a spoon, 862kcal/100g

330 2018-11-07 23:19:04 Israel wants that land and oil by any means necessary.
331 2018-11-07 23:19:00 I guess I can look forward to seeing oil rigs off the coast of Florida now.
332 2018-11-07 23:18:52 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
333 2018-11-07 23:18:48 It's nice bro, beans cooked with veg oil has its own acquired taste.. Nothing tastes like it. .. This days I use coconut milk... @ladies try it sometime, thank me later.. Need the recipe? Check me DM...

337 2018-11-07 23:18:16 It's like a diamond dig vacation. Go camping, strike oil. BAM!
338 2018-11-07 23:18:10 You didn't stop the closure of Coast Guard Centres that prevent shipping accidents...they prevent pollution/oil spills.
339 2018-11-07 23:17:48 I’d say 3 days lol their body heat makes the natural oils secrete and then their skin absorbs the oil. It’ll take a bit for it to get in their system good lol
340 2018-11-07 23:17:43 Morocco oil
341 2018-11-07 23:17:42 I think they likely will extract a significant price for our Indy, probably refuse to play ball without a period of a share of the oil and gas, a long pull out period for trident and generous access to our waters
342 2018-11-07 23:17:38 You mean the electric gas and oil companies. We know they r part of the chamber of commerce bc it's on the commerce website.
343 2018-11-07 23:17:38 Oil City' Christian Cole is up to 4,842 career rushing yards and Sharon's Jordan Wilson has 4,452. There are only 9 5,000-yard rushers in D-10 history
In addition to the 5 with 6,000 and Zack Helsley, Joe Korcinsky (Greenville), Mike Archie (Sharon) and Garrett Owens (North East)
344 2018-11-07 23:17:36 we clearly know you dont know how to change your own oil

346 2018-11-07 23:17:12 Sear the steak in a little olive oil and ponzu, then put it in the oven until it reaches the temp you like. Meanwhile cook some asparagus in the steak fat and butter while you wait. One pan to clean and your mouth will orgasm. win-win.

352 2018-11-07 23:15:54 @R_Zandi @summer_said 
Hello Summer and Reza,
did you hear any feedback from Iran leaders on the matter of special / escrow accounts required to sell oil under recently issued waiver for 8 countries? Is this condition acceptable for Iran?
353 2018-11-07 23:15:49 ang sarap naman, gamitin ko rin yung oil para ijaks ka? :))
354 2018-11-07 23:15:35 That sounds awesome perfect. Gotta love beard oil that makes you smell like a lumberjack. The number of times I have told/bothered @Mcdizziness about me "smelling like a sexy lumberjack" is uncountable.
355 2018-11-07 23:15:18 ไม่โอเคเลย
356 2018-11-07 23:15:16 MAGA voters promiscuously talk about Venezuela and then go hire a mafia boss to run their country. Venezuela collapsed due to corruption and low oil prices, America could collapse under the weight of corruption and record debt.
357 2018-11-07 23:15:16 I'm consistently oil pulling twice a day now and I must say I'm loving the results 
358 2018-11-07 23:15:06 @SamHarrisOrg Maybe you should invite  "Oil's Useful Idiot," University of Washington Atmospheric Science Professor @CliffMass on the show? He's supported a WA climate tax in 2016 but opposed the initiative this year. The left has called him "Racist" and "Trumps Weatherman."

367 2018-11-07 23:13:48 Tetrahydrocannabinol is one of at least 113 cannabinoids identified in cannabis. If your driver needs the oil for medical reasons get a note, the law has been changed recently. Otherwise sack him, he's driving a train with paying customers on it

372 2018-11-07 23:13:17 wheatgerm oil tastes like flour
373 2018-11-07 23:13:06 It looks like they made major adjustments to get more supportive environmental groups, and increase support in the public. I think campaign finance reform would regulate being outspent by big oil and it may have a chance when propaganda is tamed

I am not an oil trader, I counsel clients on opportunisitc basic investments. but your very existence helps me nonetheless, since it keeps "surprises" off the oil market
381 2018-11-07 23:12:18 Salad with plum tomatoes, olive oil, soy sauce and sour cream. Serve with small portion of grilled manila clams in cheddar cheese.
382 2018-11-07 23:12:18 Oil less or nah?
383 2018-11-07 23:12:17 I don't think there will be much oil/gas industry worth anything left in Canada by end of next year thanks to you. Note that climate change is getting worse. While oil and gas production in the world set records. Your strategy has failed for climate change and failed Canada too.
384 2018-11-07 23:12:14 And the linseed oil headaches. For me anyway.
385 2018-11-07 23:12:12 Not sure I should’ve been using terms like “pool water,” “Mountain Dew,” and “motor oil” with the sommelier at Atomix last night. These were all good things though! Wonderful dining experience overall. Congrats, @chezsine on the Michelin Star!

390 2018-11-07 23:11:35 What about CBD oil. Can be useful as well?
391 2018-11-07 23:11:34 @Drake I’m a great cook (I’m Maltese, Sicilian, and Native American, so I gotta have that olive oil in my veins), probably wife material, though I’ve never been told that  I’ll be here. #winning #bbw #dateme #impressiveresume

393 2018-11-07 23:11:24 Ongoing liquidity constraint can explain crude oil futures curve change, interbank mkt funding constraint, and treasuries rate elevation. That said, stock market compared to the aforementioned three, may indeed be more sentiment driven. Still sentiment without liquidity can't
394 2018-11-07 23:11:04 I understand your concerns and blair is undoubtedly orchestrating something but no way will he ever make a comeback any more than Cameron - both are damaged goods. The Middle East is still the biggest threat to stability esp if Iran/Saud kick off and oil supplies cease.
395 2018-11-07 23:10:57 what crap is this, say atleast walk for 1hr more or use healthy oil to prepare sweets and prepare with more nutritious ingredients.  I'm happy if you say stop eating at KFC and MCcay

397 2018-11-07 23:10:14 I heard of something a while ago, I don't know if it's accurate or not, but wasn't there a bacterium created that breaks down petroleum to clean up oil spills? If true, wouldn't using it on the garbage patch clean some of it up as many plastics are petroleum based?

400 2018-11-07 23:09:44 One can only imagine how this Dangote’s refinery will change the dynamics of oil import/export in Nigeria and Africa at large.  So much burden will be taken out of the nation’s economy.

402 2018-11-07 23:09:24 I hope you have home owners insurance because big oil ain’t gonna be there for you when your house gets flooded or burnt down due to forest fires/natural disasters 
403 2018-11-07 23:09:08 a salad dressing of the ancient Greeks involved olive oil, of course extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, sea salt, and some honey and that then was shaken well, and it was drizzled over salads that they were preparing for eating.

407 2018-11-07 23:08:33 @PlayDomiNations can we get an event that makes the castle 66% off or something? It takes f o r e v e r  to save up enough oil.
408 2018-11-07 23:08:28 CO may have turned blue when it comes to people, but Prop 112 (oil/gas fracking sites will remain 500 ft from homes/schools/etc.) sailed to victory with 57%. 
The proposal would have moved wells 2500 ft. from homes.

414 2018-11-07 23:07:42 I just got some words in while sitting in my car, getting an oil change. This has to be a new record for “weirdest place I’ve NaNoWriMo’d.” #NaNoWriMo #AmWriting
415 2018-11-07 23:07:24 I've never seen a woman stringing wires up a telegraph pole or abseiling on an offshore oil rig or setting blasting caps down a coal mine. But if they did it would be on equal money.
416 2018-11-07 23:07:19 Lavender oil is fantastic. I don't know if it is allowed for you, but Epsom salts with lavender oil are great, and a source of magnesium. But again, wouldn't presume to advise. I just find them immensely helpful, as it is difficult to get enough magnesium through my foods.
417 2018-11-07 23:07:09 Why do you have to talk like that ? Does it make you feel  bigger or something ? It makes you look like a wanna be . You parents need to give you a dose of castor oil ! Clean out both ends
418 2018-11-07 23:07:07 AUNT ON FACEBOOK: Oregano oil will detoxify your system & prevent colds!

422 2018-11-07 23:06:33 @GermainToyota Awful service both in sales and in the service department.  After 5 cars this will be the last.  Your finance department lies, your service department may be able to change oil but not much else, and your sales department sells cars that are dangerous to drive.

447 2018-11-07 23:02:56 Norway has a lot of oil that's another reason why its a reason rich country along with their relatively small population
448 2018-11-07 23:02:51 - I need the exchange as my ring tone or alarm.
449 2018-11-07 23:02:40 Oil is a largely economically inelastic product and demand with no easy comparable direct alternative YET. Gas tax is meant to fund roads, which we really need. But to argue for it to stop oil, well just ask the UK. It just increases prices of everything.

451 2018-11-07 23:02:22 And like no offense, but you really emphasize that CBD brands only offer super low dosages, which also isn't 100% accurate. It might not be as common but brands like ours do sell concentrated CBD oil. Just the oil in a syringe at 250mgs a gram, that's a lot of CBD.
452 2018-11-07 23:02:11 Manners to a person is like oil to an engine, it makes everything run smoother.

480 2018-11-07 22:58:57 I don't even understand why Russia would try to hide their Iranian oil purchases, Trump and Republicans can't and won't do anything about it. 
Moreover, the US and allies treaty with Iran is still valid even if Trump rejects it.
481 2018-11-07 22:58:51 I don’t think the transition is going to be as smooth as you envision... think of all the the $ available for research and development for sustainable “green energy” that could be generated by selling our oil at a market price-we are fools not to take advantage of this resource
482 2018-11-07 22:58:49 I have had great results! I have been taking it since March and now I'm off both of my anxiety meds! I use the CBD Oil drops and I vape it!

485 2018-11-07 22:58:14 i can’t wait till the day that my mom doesn’t lecture me about the keto diet and the harms of eating soy products and how bad palm oil is for you and how acv is god’s gift and how bread is hell and
486 2018-11-07 22:58:10 Yes That is correct. He thinks by firing them he can cover up his lies  and corruption but the Russia deal is there for all  to see  when he had the secret meeting .with Putin. He want the oil partnership with Russia.
487 2018-11-07 22:58:08 Yeah, I'm not too worried about running out of whale oil. Got whale oil coming out of my ears these days. Don't know what to do with it all.
488 2018-11-07 22:57:57 So this year the commission came up with 20 they wanted, thought that would be too confusing and, through combining issues and such, put 7 on the ballot. 

And that's the story of how Florida came to pass the banning of offshore oil drilling and vaping in offices with one vote.
489 2018-11-07 22:57:53 I thought Washington state was one of your environmental allies? They rejected a carbon tax last night, I guess they are only your allies when it comes to keeping CDN oil landlocked. Once again the Green Party were used by US special interest.

566 2018-11-07 22:46:08 I'm confused. Isn't Russia's biggest source of revenue oil? Why would they buy oil from another country, rather than use their own? Unless they're getting below market prices for Iranian oil it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

570 2018-11-07 22:45:51 Why are you inviting a backbencher onto your show? 

Him and the failed IDS just churn out snake oil promises with zero substance.

And Bloomberg reporting firms quitting City for Amsterdam. "Sunny uplands" or "50 years for Brexit benefits to be seen"?
571 2018-11-07 22:45:44 You probably know this but check the bore. Most likely dark but check for pitting.  Ball ammo. I clean with warm soapy water then oil after shooting.  Solbent will NOT clean properly.

582 2018-11-07 22:43:50 He’s a snake oil salesman. A lot of folks bought it and are convinced it’s going to help them.
583 2018-11-07 22:43:46 That democracy breeds opportunity comrade.
Why don't they go for opportunoties engendered by the the vast mineral resources of the Congo, vast oil resources of Russia, Iran or Arabie de Saudi?
584 2018-11-07 22:43:44 I don’t agree with a lot socially about the right, but economically Texas is run on oil and natural gas industries as well as agriculture, and historically republicans are better for those industries 
585 2018-11-07 22:43:30 Westmonster could hide the oil wealth from Scotland if it was controlled from London
586 2018-11-07 22:43:28 It’s hysterical! The GOP politicians say it isn’t real bc they get paid a ton under the table by big oil corporations like Exxon or BP to vote in favor of them. Republican voters deny it because they hear their politicians “don’t believe” in it 
587 2018-11-07 22:43:24 I went to an animation/art school open house last Sunday and my mum was urging me to show the lady in charge my animation Midnight Oil.
She correctly identified that I didn’t make Sabrina lose her legs for comedic purposes but rather as a way avoid animating her walking.

592 2018-11-07 22:42:52 Shoot for an HR if possible. Track edition has brembos. Oil consumption is almost unavoidable on a DE. Tires had uneven wear issues (alignment, easy fix) rear diff bushing can bust and leak black fluid down the subframe. Best to replace with poly. DM if you have any other q’s 
593 2018-11-07 22:42:52 So my cbd oil is like £19 for less than 100mls and all my family have come over for Diwali and then proceeded to try it

598 2018-11-07 22:41:47 Which is exactly why the media is pushing as hard as they possibly can right now to take away their representation.

600 2018-11-07 22:41:41 Running smooth. No problems here. And I’m 3 months away from having it for a year. The only thing that worried me was the factory recommended oil change every 10,000 or every year.
601 2018-11-07 22:41:36 At least this should tak Zim miles away from oil shortages.
602 2018-11-07 22:41:32 Some indomies actually come with oil
603 2018-11-07 22:41:27 just drank a ~wellness rescue~ shot with oil of oregano, elderberry, ginger root & cayenne & i have never hated myself more

606 2018-11-07 22:41:15 I’m scared to put coconut oil on my face, I heard it clogs your pores
607 2018-11-07 22:41:08 I would stay away from the rev up models. They have oil consumption issues. I have a 2003 and everything is fine with it (aside from 3rd gear synchro being bad.) try and find a base model so you don’t have to deal with tcs/vdc
608 2018-11-07 22:41:03 A big part of his campaign was 'save the pfd', which is the check that Alaskans get yearly from oil. All the Republicans up here who are against 'handouts' are obsessed with keeping....their handout 
Many depend on it but I think it's the only 'help' they'll accept

618 2018-11-07 22:40:06 I think you are misinterpreting the role of leadership. If you think Trump is calling the shots, you are not paying attention to his oil executive apptmnts. Trump is a lightning rod. If Pelosi is a lightning rod, then she would make a great “leader”. Let the young do actual work.

623 2018-11-07 22:39:37 Thanks to all the fools that voted down restricting oil and gas yestetday
624 2018-11-07 22:39:35 So staples are back where they were when rates were at zero and oil at 30 and less competition.  This makes zero sense. Just not a thinking mans market. Just a %ucking joke.
625 2018-11-07 22:39:27 I am simply because I gave people oil instead of butter on their popcorn

639 2018-11-07 22:38:13 avoid palm oil
640 2018-11-07 22:38:13 Witch hazel, tea tree oil, and lavender oil. The trick is that as soon as you get out the shower put the witch hazel on 
641 2018-11-07 22:37:57 Well, banana cream pipes fine. But banana cream was verboten. G’gran got put in the Soldiers & Sailors Home when she was little, which was next door to a furniture factory that used banana oil. She hated bananas.
So Sugar Cream was the norm, which does not pipe at all well.
642 2018-11-07 22:37:48 I use the oil from cans of sardines, I think that is what Claudia does too.

650 2018-11-07 22:36:59 Coconut oil + diluted peppermint if it is eczema! Peppermint will sooth the itching. Tea tree (also diluted with coconut oil) can help with the bacteria infecting the skin + getting in the tiny lil scratches + things! I’ll bring you some Charity Pot bc it’s good with eczema!!

652 2018-11-07 22:36:51 Of course the WM Tories get interested after they see the huge extra oil and gas financial boost they are getting off Scotland's resources to pay for all their budget giveaways.

All of it is Scotlands and should stay in Scotland.

655 2018-11-07 22:36:37 Well no - you simply don't need palm oil at all. Just the peanuts. The palm oil is pointless. And yup - banned myself from Nutella years ago. And why in hair conditioner? (Altho' I make a nice one with rosemary steeped in cider vinegar). It's a scam.

675 2018-11-07 22:34:28 @Walmart @WalmartInc the worst at taking your car for oil change. Never again unless I just wanna waste half a day. What’s the point of making an appointment if it’s gonna take 2 hours?? 8 bays and 2 workers. Maybe hire some people and make customers happy
676 2018-11-07 22:34:27 I don't grasp your meaning.

Oil, per se, is not the issue. The issue is whether or not the rest of the world loses its belief in the notion that the US can enforce its will upon everyone else. The moment that belief is shattered, everything will change -- overnight, as it were.

685 2018-11-07 22:33:02 Have you tried putting olive oil in it for a few mins once or twice a day then giving it a good blast every time you shower?

690 2018-11-07 22:32:12 Venezuela's economic problem ties directly to their choice of making their whole economy dependent on a single resource, oil. When anything happens to oil, their hole economy is susceptible to melting down no matter the type of government.
691 2018-11-07 22:32:03 maybe you can try and mix your foundation with some face oil?
692 2018-11-07 22:32:02 So Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia don’t control thier countries? No single country controls the price of oil, even the USA. Yes nigeria was created by the British but so was India, the entire Middle East, USA and Canada. That doesn’t mean they control those countries
693 2018-11-07 22:31:48 @kashmirVIII I pushed a little harder with my micro needle roller last night lol and I used it during my oil cleansing instead of after with my moisturizer and I feel a difference !!! Thank you!!!

706 2018-11-07 22:30:34 My mom was frying chicken at home when I was drinking my coffee and all I feel like I can smell now is the oil. 
707 2018-11-07 22:30:31 side note, 

juul pods are reusable so if you’re actually serious about quitting smoking get some CBD oil & replace it. 

I quit cold turkey. You can too.

711 2018-11-07 22:30:22 You need to have oil on your head.

713 2018-11-07 22:30:14 And it’s more than just bud to smoke. Biomass, animal food, plastics, varnish, lamp oil, paper, textiles etc etc the list goes on.
714 2018-11-07 22:30:13 This! A thousand times over! They never learn, constantly giving these squeaky wheels oil for the sake of their precious 'high road' - #FuckTheHighRoad.

746 2018-11-07 22:27:37 I.e. if looking to short stock indices from daily charts, best look for a pullback, a double bottom, etc, not a breakout. Reserve breakouts for gold, crypto, crude oil, even single names, etc.

761 2018-11-07 22:26:12 This is why, IMO, it is so dangerous for the US to attempt to blockade Iranian oil shipments. If Iran, using Chinese-made ASMs, were to sink a major US warship in the narrow confines of the Straits of Hormuz, it could very conceivably catalyze the end of USD hegemony. 2/2

797 2018-11-07 22:20:59 Or we could do the leading.
Continue researching reduced CH4 from livestock to help countries where life will continue to rely heavily on animals (or those closer to large markets. Ireland?) while moving towards  cell/plant/yeast-based options.
And end reliance on oil. Obviously.
798 2018-11-07 22:20:55 And people actually vote for this clown. Only in America. Shows what a desperate state the US Economic Elite are in. Your Oil Profits are finished, deal with it.
799 2018-11-07 22:20:47 Yes!  I have RT’d numerous tweets by @profwolff espousing the same thing. In the USA we offer corps. socialist concepts such as the oil depletion allowance tax.  However, the premise of the tweet was about Gillum in Florida offering voters viable options.
800 2018-11-07 22:20:41 But Cyprus is being threaten by US NATO ally Turkey over oil & gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean
801 2018-11-07 22:20:35 You do not appear to understand some simple math. 1. Tainter's Diminishing Returns on Complexity. 2. Net energy/person. 3. Fungibility of oil, et al., vs electricity. 4. Resource limits. 

This is NOT a climate emergency, it's a resource emergency of which warming is a symptom.

823 2018-11-07 22:18:33 No dude, this bill is crapola. If we're serious about helping change the environment then all carbon emitting companies should be taxed. This bill isolated oil companies (which, surprisingly, aren't even the worst!) Need a more encompassing world saving bill that's equal.
824 2018-11-07 22:18:31 I have carbon tax solution:

For those who do not wish to participate, they have to option of being carbon sequestration sponges. We'll place them atop smokestacks and other CO2 sources to inhale it all. When they pass, we bury them like dinosaurs for future oil!

833 2018-11-07 22:17:52 Nope. No butter. No oil. Let it come at least close to room temp first though. I use a cast iron pan but I’d imagine any roasting pan would work. It takes a little less than an hour. Depends on size. You should tie the legs but I’ve never owned twine and it’s never been a problem
834 2018-11-07 22:17:37 Oil and water don’t mix. Therefore it is not possible for you to have my best interest at heart in any capacity and engage with anyone who has intentionally done me any harm in anyway. You call it petty, I call it protecting my MF peace.

839 2018-11-07 22:16:45 That was actually quite funny for me. 
Im glad I keep you going. All the fun for me..and I get to listen to my tunes. Best bit my katie Melua...Ive gone off James Blunt in the last two years. ...He keeps telling me Im Beautiful....
840 2018-11-07 22:16:42 Maybe cause he is trying to rid us of foreign oil dependence into a sustainable future while practically everyone else is doing nothing. Just a wild guess.

851 2018-11-07 22:15:29 I seen why he did it. Joseph hit was clean. I’d just be embarrassed as an oil fan that a 6M player can’t hit him properly, that’s all.

853 2018-11-07 22:15:14 The only fudging was in UEFA's pants. They invented FFP because they were scared of Arab oil money. Unfortunately Mike, it had no basis in real law and UEFA were so smug and thick, they didn't exoect to be challenged.

881 2018-11-07 22:11:42 adulting done right: spending 70 on an extremely overpriced oil change and then having your father call your property management company to argue for you
882 2018-11-07 22:11:36  I know the feeling. 4 years for me but not so long on here. I’ve said it before but your posts help to keep me going along with a few other sensible grounded folks and our fantastic spotters. Otherwise there would be nothing! Just silence and eventual insanity, Ha!
883 2018-11-07 22:11:32 Also those oil changes that cost $20-40 are most of the time cheap conventional oils that only last 3,000 miles. Same goes for the oil filter. I’m not saying it’s bad to get your oil change at a shop, but like I said I get mine done for $30 and lasts 10k miles.

888 2018-11-07 22:11:03 @honestburgers had a poor experience in your Tooting branch tonight. Gluten free bun option forgotten. I had a long human hair hanging off a chip and we got home and realised our clothes and hair smelt of fried oil. Never ever had to wash hair after a date before

- USD currency area shrinking

I can tell you. We have lots of lakes and trees.

Not many oil refineries around.
928 2018-11-07 22:06:49 So. Much. Bumble & Bumble invisible oil.
929 2018-11-07 22:06:34 It finally happened....I went to a bar and ordered a drink and food by myself. I'm getting my oil changed/car inspected so I walked to a restaurant to have dinner and figured might as well have a bud light with it. Definitely don't see this being a regular tho
930 2018-11-07 22:06:23 Will someone tell clueless John Hickenlooper to just STFU I mean to shut the fuck up!
You lean CONservative and you fellate the oil & gas oligarchy.
Some good people were bamboozled by the LIES of you and fossil fuel snakes and $40 million spent to spread them.
931 2018-11-07 22:06:19 High THC cannabis oil with CBD's ... do some research !!  (seriously) .
932 2018-11-07 22:06:16 Lmao I get my oil changed and forget how to act.
933 2018-11-07 22:06:07 Major miscalculation not getting these out before election?
934 2018-11-07 22:05:50 4. FILLING - 
Heat the oil & butter together in a large pan. Add the mushrooms & garlic & fry in 2 batches until golden brown. Transfer to a plate, then add the spinach to the pan. Cook until wilted, then return the mushrooms to the pan. Pour in stock & stir in mascarpone.
935 2018-11-07 22:05:41 I mean it would honestly be really easy for Dems to just take over the Green Party line and win over those voters but they're too beholden to donors from the oil and gas industry to actually make environmentalism a central part of their platform that they'll actually uphold.
936 2018-11-07 22:05:41 Trump is panicking. I can smell the fear from here. It smells like sweaty orange suntan oil. He’s moving on Mueller because he’s scared. He’s lashing out because he knows the House is going to be a check on him and his visions of an authoritarian regime.
937 2018-11-07 22:05:18 He knows exactly what that would do, I’m sure he wants all the oil exploration and exploitation there was in the 1930’s being used again. I won’t be the least bit surprised when he brings Blockbuster video and 8 track cassettes back from the dead.

946 2018-11-07 22:04:36 Example of an inherently flawed political philosophy:

"My opponents are anti-intellectual, anti-peace, bigoted fascists, who are fast-tracking our planet's destruction in the service of lining the pockets of the oil and gas industry.

I can't wait to compromise with them."
947 2018-11-07 22:04:27 psa: don’t go to jiffy lube when your dad can’t answer the phone bc you’ll get peer pressured into spending $300 when you’re only supposed to get an $60 oil change

949 2018-11-07 22:04:16 Could it be that the oil lobby dumped millions into fighting it?
950 2018-11-07 22:04:07 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us IMPRACTICALLY HUGE WALLS BUILT FOR RACISM!
951 2018-11-07 22:04:07 If boggles my mind that due to so much gov’t intervention/regulation we are unable to access, ship and sell oil for a fair market price, $ that helps maintain our enviable social systems. Without that source of cash, the money has to come from somewhere-taxpayers are almost dry!
952 2018-11-07 22:04:07 @RadioDana Love you guys!   Would you let us know where you buy your CBD oil from?  I don't think I have heard you mention it.  I take it all the time but I am out now and need to replenish.  Thank you.

954 2018-11-07 22:03:59 How to help City win a game? Rig the ground and get a partly sighted ref to officiate! Of course add some cash and a brand new Rolls Royce to help the ref to get home after the game. City : Having oil is priceless.
955 2018-11-07 22:03:54 There is only one Scandinavian country with oil. The rest have none.
956 2018-11-07 22:03:52 One thing I don’t think people appreciate is how fast technology is changing in oil and gas. We talk about techniques used on wells from 2014 like it’s ancient history.
957 2018-11-07 22:03:33 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
958 2018-11-07 22:03:20 Hello Chris! Thank you for reaching out to Lucas Oil. We recommend replacing 20% of your oil capacity with Synthetic Oil Stabilizer.
959 2018-11-07 22:03:03 The others can be pure, look to see that it's been tested, and "molecularly distilled" is good too. The Norwegian oil above is concentrated, so it has much more omega-3 than just fish oil, 85% vs 20%.

966 2018-11-07 22:02:29 I love olive oil! My fav use is in smoothies, I only cook with it on rare occasion bc unless it is light olive oil it'll burn and smoke easily. For empenadas I use canola
967 2018-11-07 22:02:29 I’m joking btw class goal and keeper had no chance.
968 2018-11-07 22:02:23 The programs they are pushing for aren't very radical in the worldview. So no...taxing the rich and corps. would be more than enough to cover the costs of the programs. 

Not to mention cutting back on subsidies to oil/gas and cutting down out-of-control military spending.

974 2018-11-07 22:01:50 Well, if that is the case, why are you leasing them out for oil-gas-coal? Great healing next drilling! You are such a phony. It sound like you may be leaving soon & you will be missed--i.e., anyone concerned about conservation will be GLAD to see you go.
975 2018-11-07 22:01:48 Thank you for that. We literally lost across the board including all measures except G which allows for oil companies to continue drilling and lets my bro in law keep his family here. The gas tax is going to make it tough to pay our bills. Putting it in God’s hands now
976 2018-11-07 22:01:47 We will agree to disagree but I believe you are not giving the brilliance of that finish the credit it deserves.

980 2018-11-07 22:01:29 cannabis oil itu kalau di pedalaman Thailand Selatan selain dipakai untuk makanan juga untuk semacam balsem. Jadi kalau mau ngebahas soal kapitalis, ini beda porsinya karena mereka mengandalkan lab research + jaringan penjualan dunia.

1001 2018-11-07 21:59:55 2. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a large frying pan over med-high heat. Use kitchen paper to wipe out excess. Pour in ladleful of batter. 
Tilt pan to swirl batter around so it covers base. Cook for 1 minute until set on top & golden brown on base. Flip & cook for 30 secs other side.
1002 2018-11-07 21:59:48 Oil is down. Gold is up
1003 2018-11-07 21:59:40 If it's the same operator, they should be shut down until they clean up their act. Are they properly cleaning out the oil and gas reservoirs before they shred these cars?
1004 2018-11-07 21:59:08 Jose ni Konki, Konki...oil chafu aka master of dark arts
1005 2018-11-07 21:59:02 Also - somewhat pleasant to see some divergence between energy equities and the underlying oil price. Maybe get some strong moves once oil forms a bottom and differentials really come in.
1006 2018-11-07 21:59:01 @alonzolerone I have an easy way to make it easier to peel eggs. I put in vegetable oil in the water while I’m boiling them. It definitely makes them easier to peel.
1007 2018-11-07 21:58:59 Get yo bundles that way u still wont have to touch ur hair i gotta wig n still i have to make sure my hair as oil in n etc.
1008 2018-11-07 21:58:56 i love making pancakes (use oil instead of butter for crisp edges) w diff fruit and they’re nice w a lil peanut butter in the batter. oatmeal is a fave too. i always add bananas. eggs benedict! i don’t make it often but it’s beautiful. omelettes, frittata, slow cooked grits
1009 2018-11-07 21:58:39 Sûrement dû au gas oil !
1010 2018-11-07 21:58:28 There’s usually a lot more on the horizon, but depends on the weather and oil prices!

1012 2018-11-07 21:58:16 Technically speaking everyone pays for oil changes idk what this guy is getting at
1013 2018-11-07 21:58:11 Isn't Diwali about the dude who returned to his family and native place after being exiled...like engineering students living away in hostels..
Kisike family drama ke liye we in this economy are still wasting oil and shitting on environment..weird flex , but ok.

1018 2018-11-07 21:57:57 I agree Mandy. I figured that since Polis was elected, all of the props and amendments to increase taxes and destroy oil would pass. I was shocked this morning! It makes no sense?  Dems here voted sensibly when it came to taxes but Polis may spend like crazy. I just moved back

1026 2018-11-07 21:57:07 It most certainly does if you understand that some locations have few people, but need incentive to participate in the United States.  Alaska, vast oil reserves, small pop.  If they were autonomous, they’d be fine.  City dwellers, not so much.  You need them.  Don’t forget it.

1029 2018-11-07 21:56:48 How long is this sustainable? 
1. lower taxes
2. create tariffs on metals (more cost to build infrastructure pipelines etc)
2. tariffs on grains (hurt US farmers)...give subsidies (w/what $?)
3. try to suppress oil price, giving way to more subsidies
this whole plan is insane

1032 2018-11-07 21:56:40 TRUMP SUPPORTERS. HE IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE!!!

The snake oil salesman always got away with it because no one wanted to admit that they were a "mark".

Don't let flimflam man, trump, get away with it.
1033 2018-11-07 21:56:29 Let dad use my car bc he had a flat and he brings it back with a new oil filter idk if I should feel loved or ashamed...
1034 2018-11-07 21:56:26 Do any #keto or #lchf people out there have good recommendations for great olive oil?
1035 2018-11-07 21:56:13 Hmmm very interesting to know! I’m just switching all my makeup and skin care to natural oil free stuff to see if it will help
1036 2018-11-07 21:56:04 How could have Rashford not score that ball how
1037 2018-11-07 21:56:04 Well none of that pertains to me since I don’t take my car to shops just for oil changes. But a lot of common folk don’t know about what I said. 

But hey, if you found a good system that works for you then that’s great. For me, DIY is cheaper and gives me more peace of mind 
1038 2018-11-07 21:56:00 bio oil
1039 2018-11-07 21:55:58 It’s not really a miracle. You simply gave the financial hucksters a pass (via de-regulation) to start selling snake oil again. And when the bottom falls out of the economy in 12-15 years, you’ll be long gone... Just like Bill Clinton.

1045 2018-11-07 21:55:42 @BarackObama I am not sure who owns OPEC surely it is some world consortium investment that used Saudi oil and lobbying to keep prices low so they could buy US and British oil for pennies on the dollar whom also blamed you for the oil spill

1053 2018-11-07 21:54:53 All about the cbd oil 
1054 2018-11-07 21:54:52 Not sure it tells us much. People still don't like to vote to raise their own taxes. And green spending is no panacea for making carbon taxes popular. And oil co's have tremendous power to kill climate policies they don't like. What do you think?

1080 2018-11-07 21:51:39 Right, and sugar, potatoes and vegetable oil have nothing to do with it.  Crisps are healthy, coz they're not meat!!  Yay!!  NOT!!
What would you do with all the farm animals if we stopped eating meat?  Turn them loose in a country that doesn't have a predator bigger than a fox?

1086 2018-11-07 21:51:11 Yeah, the sound you will hear from the Permian Basin will be a large explosion if oil hits $30. 

That is the sound of bankers, lenders, and investors ‘s heads exploding after realizing a negative return.

1095 2018-11-07 21:50:06 $1.4bn of private investment would still build 700MW of wind. There has been over 1,200MW of wind proposed by the private sector in NL since 1990, all denied. Fascinating how we celebrate private investment in oil, and legislate against private investment in renewable energy.
1096 2018-11-07 21:50:06 Frying an empanada in olive instead of canola oil. Is it gonna taste weird? What do y'all use?
1097 2018-11-07 21:50:05 Many of us do... however, urban dwellers tend to forget things such as their beef comes from farms.... Not sure how we wake the masses to the fact that oil has, does and will continue to pay the bills for years to go! Time to get a fair price for our natural wealth!!
1098 2018-11-07 21:49:54 You should try CBD. Cannabis would be better but it's not legal in most places. CBD however is. You can find it online in oil form

Are there any local art stores that have good oil paints and decent brushes/knives that won’t break my bank?
1111 2018-11-07 21:48:40 Well dead people can’t become irrelevant CCP so they can’t be “corruption charge’d” & China is a nations which imports oil so they need that irrelevant CCP.
1112 2018-11-07 21:48:39 so fuels would be a second life. But better than landfilling and reduces these costs to your client (us the taxpayer). Dont forget the angle of displacing virgin oil extraction which will have a carbon reduction figure via a well to wheel calculation.
1113 2018-11-07 21:48:38 “I need to get an oil change”

1123 2018-11-07 21:47:53 Are they serious with this? I'm straight as an arrow but Idris Elba is a smexy SOB.
1124 2018-11-07 21:47:42 You mean, unconventional oil
1125 2018-11-07 21:47:41 I've been one saying this. This oil has a high degree of purity but it also depends on storage conditions, mainly temperature. I'd like to see them fill the bottle with nitrogen.
1126 2018-11-07 21:47:41 Also you can caramelize them in a pan with the olive oil, then add a little water cover and steam. This method makes them super tender. 
1127 2018-11-07 21:47:37 Things do seem to be going in the right direction.
Wishing the best of luck for Ukog and Angs holders.

1284 2018-11-07 21:30:22 @coopukfood Can you tell me the source of the palm oil in you own-brand peanut butter? I'd like to avoid deforestation.
1285 2018-11-07 21:30:20 I spent so much time telling people that it was a fools mission to vote for it since station owners and oil companies would never actually lower the price even if it were repealed.  Maybe a symbolic 5 cent decrease followed by an immediate reversal due to some refinery issue.

1289 2018-11-07 21:30:02 Agreed. The constant focus is watching the next episode of racist white man. They get so caught up on the promises of “rights” and racism that they keep getting sold the same snake oil.

1294 2018-11-07 21:29:18 Mayo is Eggs and Oil mixed, cake requires both in the recipe emulsified. Portillos uses half of the eggs and oil in a cake recipe and substitutes the salt oil and eggs for a cup of mayonnaise. It’s pretty clutch, it’s no duck fat but it’s clutch.

1302 2018-11-07 21:28:37 I don’t like low oil prices, but I don’t like high gas prices. Then I was reading all the negative comments and was getting a bit confused...until I saw this is on “Fake News” CNBC crap show...I’m gone!

1316 2018-11-07 21:27:26 Oh no, it's not that I don't care, it's just that I don't think I could tell the difference between oil or pastel if I see it... So I guess I like both!
1317 2018-11-07 21:27:25 Ironically, they did not know there was substantial oil in the area yet. There was in Iran. There wasn't in Syria or Palestine (though people were looking). It had not been found in eastern Arabia yet.

1338 2018-11-07 21:23:36 I’ve always loved wheels and the smell of oil/petrol and engineering. I loved my last car like it was a close friend, that’s weird and I don’t understand it. Took me 3 months after it was wrecked to scrap it. Everyone’s different, but driving does bring out the worst in people.

That's what I calls a Green politician!

1406 2018-11-07 21:14:32 The oil companies don’t care about revenue. So long as they are allowed, oil company employees, in every role, will continue to express loyalty by increasing production. If taxes create a glut of fossil fuel, the wealthy will hoard fossil fuel for sale in the relapse.

1408 2018-11-07 21:14:17 Yeah no thanks I work with gallons and gallons of hydraulic elevator oil every week .. on my days off I will happily drop my car off at my mechanics for a quick oil change. Didn’t realize that was that some sort of new toxic masculinity trait

1414 2018-11-07 21:13:23 My marine policy class today was really disheartened. Tax fatigue from the previous revenue neutral carbon tax attempt and the sugar tax stuff may have played a role. Also the ~$33 million out-of-state oil companies spent to spread their message effectively didn’t help.

1422 2018-11-07 21:12:29 The Bushs have oil money, and the Clintons collected money from every outfit globally. I don't know if there is clean money anywhere. Trump is focused domestically which is better than most.

1475 2018-11-07 21:05:28 Though solely not responsible but still played a major role in reducing the oil prices by completely ignoring Jamal Khashoggi's killing and other factor's to gain a some short-term economic success for his regime.
1476 2018-11-07 21:05:23 Agreed. Supertweet. 
Sad fact is pro-sport and its legion of fanboy-typewriters are currently the number one source for fake news world wide.

1479 2018-11-07 21:04:32 Nah grease is no bueno  I don’t know much about waves but I know about natural hair and the best would be a water based conditioner before an oil and/or styling product. And you’re gonna want your hair to fully dry under that compression. My brother never takes his off wet.

1483 2018-11-07 21:03:48 they could have missed deliberately but, like the classless financially doped egregious termagants that they are, they just saw it as part of what oil money entitles you to.

1491 2018-11-07 21:02:32 Midterms are over now indices are allowed to look at economic numbers and rally. Long retail oil traders all got margin called. Watch the fuck out November.

What about Hillary's handling of top secret e-mails, or her sale of these to the Russians, or the sale of 1/5 of our oil reserve to Russia, or for allowing the butchering of Ambassador Stevens & his aids in Benghazi. Yeah, rule of law.

1533 2018-11-07 20:57:35 Perfect 
1534 2018-11-07 20:57:29 It’s perfectly rational you dimwit. Does an oil magnate in Texas have the same needs as a lawyer in DC? How about a peanut farmer in Alabama vs a neurosurgeon in Seattle? The senate is there to protect minority groups, where the house gives power to the majority.
1535 2018-11-07 20:57:27 You can thank us for saving the coastline!  You won't be seeing plastic bags anymore or dealing with an oil spill, which would destroy the beautiful Lowcountry.
1536 2018-11-07 20:57:25 No he should not be removed. Every time he's in there and he speaking he clearly shows how biased himself and CNN are. 98% negative. Nothing about the great unemployment numbers, nothing about the trade deals. Nothing about a 25% reduction of oil imports to China. CNN is a joke
1537 2018-11-07 20:57:20 Thank you for supporting local control, however the reality is Dems have been hiding behind R votes on Oil and Gas. When Dems controlled legislature in 2012-13 no local control bill was introduced. You have several Dem state legislators who formally opposed 112 & take O&G $$$.
1538 2018-11-07 20:57:15 Brent oil prices rose between 17th August and 24th August 2018 due to the US sanctions on Iran. Fuel prices rose from $75.60 to $78.09 within that period.
1539 2018-11-07 20:57:13 The Emperor waved his hand and the price of oil receded.
1540 2018-11-07 20:57:07 Not to be controversial but when I see Irish and British chefs attempting to cook med cuisine, especially when they substitute olive oil with butter or try to make a tomatoe sauce, I think what my granny would say.

1543 2018-11-07 20:56:54 Yes! Use an AHA toner every other night to exfoliate, then follow-up with the shea butter. I find Vitamin D + calcium, iron and zinc helpful in addition to fish oil. Bones, blood, immunity and anti-inflammatory magic. 
1544 2018-11-07 20:56:41 Last RT. I remember when I was a kid around 8 or 9, I fried plantain & whilst removing the fry pan from the fire, the hot oil poured on my hand. Excruciating pain for days.
1545 2018-11-07 20:56:37 Pero sube la luz, sube el gas, sube el gas oil, sube la gasolina, suben los impuestos, sube la cuota de los autónomos...... y todos en casita porque los han subido los partidos q gobiernan para el pueblo y defienden los derechos sociales 
1546 2018-11-07 20:56:34 Oil down 8 days in a row, most since July 2014. Oil production exports surge to 11.6 million barrels. WTI pennies from a 20% drawdown from 2018 peak. Gasoline futures lowest in more than a year.
1547 2018-11-07 20:56:34 what if when you’re outside in the cold the oil on your face solidified like coconut oil
1548 2018-11-07 20:56:26 Witch hazel, drink water, eat a fruit, hail Satan, apply tea tree oil.

1551 2018-11-07 20:56:05 Iran sanctions Trump has allowed some countries to import Iran oil. Trump cited oil prices. If Iran can't export ANY OIL that could lead to war. Iran needs to export oil. Does USA want war with Iran or to break Iran economically? Iran will not compromise with USA

1555 2018-11-07 20:55:46 Major confidence boost for future people of NL, children and grandchildren, especially youth with news record bids by oil companies almost 1.4-Billion dollars for exploration.

1559 2018-11-07 20:55:17 Listened to this song that I love on the way to dance class. So it was low tire pressure tho my tires looked fine. So left my car for an oil change. $80 bux! Yikes. But at least they rotate the tires and wash it. Hope to go a few places after I get my car in a couple of hours.
1560 2018-11-07 20:55:16 Dear @BNNBloomberg 
Why do you even show $WTI oil and $NYMEX gas while overlooking $AECO gas and $WCS oil? If as a country, Canada is not going to build pipelines and if the gov't continues to squander FDI, wouldn't the price of "Bananas" or even "SchruteBucks" be more relevant?
1561 2018-11-07 20:55:13 أنت جيت امتى يا محمااااه 
1562 2018-11-07 20:55:11 IT WAS - he asked Saudi increase production 

he ignored the killing in Turkey so got pay back extra oil SA
1563 2018-11-07 20:55:10 Must get you some muscle oil for all the flexing you're doing.
1564 2018-11-07 20:55:09 Brussels Sprouts are really good if you know how to cook them. Cut them in half or quarters. Olive oil and salt. Spread on pan and cook in oven.
1565 2018-11-07 20:54:54 Tea tree oil, petroleum vaseline and plenty of water. You can thank me on Saturday with a pint of Bud Shite x
1566 2018-11-07 20:54:49 oh, it was just about like/dislike feel, i mean i understand you don't care really, but just in case you don't want oil portrait for example. i don't know anything about music, but i like what you are doing, or Liszt, or Pink Floyd, in art it is about feeling, not knowing
1567 2018-11-07 20:54:46   my dog is a nervous wreck at times like lightning, etc and cbd oil really chills him out
1568 2018-11-07 20:54:37 Why not ask Norway how o do it, they have £1trillion Oil Fund? Of course, that would mean the Tories would have to stop thieving the Oil & Gas income from Scotland and actually invest it for the future ... that will never happen, will it?
1569 2018-11-07 20:54:37 Ion never seen a Nigga take a rag to the club because he be leaking oil from that big head !
1570 2018-11-07 20:54:20 There's so much snake oil you just need a little spark.
1571 2018-11-07 20:54:08 Glad we paid that ref a whole load of dirty oil money to give that penalty.
1572 2018-11-07 20:54:04 My skin is EXTREMELY FUCKING OILY so that rarely happens to me. I just focus on diet, pore and oil reduction. In the winter my skin is at home lol. I break out in summer in really bad heat bumps so I'm ready for this cold henny.
1573 2018-11-07 20:53:56 I've never seen the oil light in my car...
1574 2018-11-07 20:53:55 Is oil code for sex? RT @Frank_GriffeyJr: Speaking of oil changes I need to check my oil

1578 2018-11-07 20:53:12 I blame TV. The amount of negative ads was incredible for many of the props. At least any relating to the Oil, Dialysis or Real Estate industries. They all had ads playing 24/7 on networks I've seen. Some where incredibly compelling if I didn't research. Positive ads I saw? 0.
1579 2018-11-07 20:53:11 What lovely reminder of how I can dip bread into liquids like gravy, olive oil, and soup!
1580 2018-11-07 20:53:10 @danpfeiffer you are dreaming.  Trump has the democratics by the balls. If snake oil shummer tries anything the new a g  is going after obama, crooked hillary, comey, brennen, clapper,  lynch etc. The house cannot do anything on this the president has the power for this.
1581 2018-11-07 20:52:55 I’m watching Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat & I’m about to become an olive oil SNOB I tell you.
1582 2018-11-07 20:52:48 il faut être lucide : vu l'état du budget de l'Etat, il est illusoire d'imaginer pouvoir "détourner" la totalité des recettes correspondantes à la TICPE en faveur de la TE.
la sobriété (ex : 80 km/h) c'est de la transition efficace qui ne coute pas 1 rond ou presque! :/

1584 2018-11-07 20:52:17 then my White piercing guy asked me, "So what are you doing? why is your nose piercing healing so fast? mine didn't heal this fast" he has multiple nose piercings and a lot of tattoos, I told him I was using Pratima's Healing Neem oil

1590 2018-11-07 20:51:46 News Flash. Alberta runs on oil money.  Pay attention.
1591 2018-11-07 20:51:41 It was a good day for corporations yesterday in Washington. The soda tax ban (funded by big soda) passed and the carbon fee (big oil spent over $30 mil to defeat it) failed.
1592 2018-11-07 20:51:37 Man City exposed for committing fraud and the FA appeal Mourinho's appeal that Mou already won.

OIL. MONEY.

Brazilian Orange & Chilli Cocoa 
A truly decadent scent where the vibrant tang of juicy Brazilian orange is fused with heart – warming cocoa enhanced by an unexpected touch of chilli and crystallised ginger.

1604 2018-11-07 20:50:34 My dad works for Liberty Oil Field Services in CO ($LBRT), I was happy to see Prop 112 fail in the state. Until environmental politics can account for the loss of jobs for working-class folk (whose recourse will be the service sector), I don't support divesting from fossil fuels.
1605 2018-11-07 20:50:32 What, was this a remake of 'Charlie Chase gets an oil change?'
1606 2018-11-07 20:50:11 3- You take the oil from the Niger Delta to build Abuja, but keep us away from the big visitors,  like we are some rot that must not be seen lest we throw a dent on your grand lies of development. 

This is sickening!
1607 2018-11-07 20:50:09 my mom put peppermint essential oil on my dads toe when he got stung by a bunch of bees/he’s allergic
1608 2018-11-07 20:49:52 Snake Oil for all ailments
1609 2018-11-07 20:49:51 pas d'accord! il y a seulement 4 ans de cela, du temps où la transition énergétique se résumait à des discours, personne ne remettait en cause le fait que la TICPE allait au budget général. Si cagnotte il doit y avoir, c'est d'abord sur le cplt de taxe mis en place depuis...
1610 2018-11-07 20:49:36 You're tragic. Perhaps you need to add some oil to that hair and get a proper line up cuz your hairline is all kinds of jacked up. 

Don't come for me on my tweet about my child, unless I send for you. Weak a$$ man.
1611 2018-11-07 20:49:27 @FIVRE604 That Jean Chretien and Justin Trudeaunclear cut my property and drilled for oil and placer mining I want stopped And the money that Danny Markovitz is said to have gotten and thinks he can LAUNDER through German Charity of shill Gates hacking

1614 2018-11-07 20:49:13 Good thinking... Am away from computer, but will check on Etna like $LABU and $BID for leveraged healthcare moves. (Am also thinking Oil should reverse to upside after Trump prob kept it artificially low thru elections [along w/milk])
1615 2018-11-07 20:49:06 オイル、君なら地球を救える。

1622 2018-11-07 20:48:32 To give you an idea of ingredients, it is:
plain flour, eggs, milk, chives, olive oil, salt, pepper, butter, chestnut mushrooms, garlic, spinach, vegetable stock, mascarpone cheese, parsley, basil pesto (jar), tomatoes and parmesan cheese. 
Serves 4. Easy to adapt for more/less.
1623 2018-11-07 20:48:24 Now they’re paying refs off with all that oil money

1628 2018-11-07 20:47:57 I successfully infused vegetable oil with weed today to make my brownies and I’m pretty proud
1629 2018-11-07 20:47:39 “i discovered this stuff called ‘baby oil’.... omg Jenny it’s amazing”
okay what the actual fuck is going on
1630 2018-11-07 20:47:34 damn I was supposed to get my oil changed back in April. That’s tough.
1631 2018-11-07 20:47:33 Then they should pay 100x the value of the natural resources that are produced in Wyoming! #coal #natgas #oil #wind #bentonite #beef #lotsofotherstuff
1632 2018-11-07 20:47:32 The pipe lines create work and oil dependency.
1633 2018-11-07 20:47:25 And I have CBD bath oil and salts ! Lol
1634 2018-11-07 20:47:16 A couple of people? Do you have any idea how big the oil and gas industry is in Texas? Obviously not because you think only a couple people would lose their jobs
1635 2018-11-07 20:47:08 It’s all about Pdop his FISA is going to be declassified and will reveal more than we know. New players. And that part of this whole scandal was bc of Pdop’s and Gen Flynn’s stance on Israel. And oil. Many things always trace back to oil $$$
1636 2018-11-07 20:47:05 @JoeBudden in a Boston crab with hot oil from Ricardo the Masseur DEFINITELY deserves a nasty award  #UnleashTheFlutes @thisisrory @MAL___ @JoeBuddenPod

1641 2018-11-07 20:46:25 Oil money does not buy you class.
1642 2018-11-07 20:46:14 I don’t think it didn’t pass because it was poorly written. It didn’t pass because of misleading information from big oil and an ad campaign that lied to the public.
1643 2018-11-07 20:46:10 Try castor oil, hair oil, but substantive conversation.
1644 2018-11-07 20:45:51 Jim Acosta groped Whitehouse Aid ! While she was doing her job !
1645 2018-11-07 20:45:47 Combine 2 cups corn with 4 cups yogurt. Mix in Olive Oil. Boil. Serve on a bed of pasta
1646 2018-11-07 20:45:34 I remember the good old days when presidents used to just get blow-jobs by interns and invade countries off of fake intelligence to control oil reserves.  Life was so much simpler then.
1647 2018-11-07 20:45:25 just put hot sauce in Vandham's oil. now we wait.
1648 2018-11-07 20:45:23 Today's been a relaxing do-nothing day. Was gonna go out but I'll do that tomorrow. There are errands to run. Like getting sesame oil! How do I not have any yet!
1649 2018-11-07 20:45:16 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1650 2018-11-07 20:45:11 Nit-combing and administering olive oil to blocked ears of child. #oldschool
1651 2018-11-07 20:45:07 How far does that Oil money flow?.  Disgraced a decision. Can only laugh. Pep will be applauded in all the papers by the spineless British media
1652 2018-11-07 20:45:02 Spilled my whole damn cup. I need a oil change.
1653 2018-11-07 20:44:58 Next time I think try putting water or oil . Something to allow the bread to be less lumpy and cook it a little longer .
1654 2018-11-07 20:44:54 Was that his concession for looking other way in murder of Washington Post reporter Khashoggi- cheaper oil prices .... disgusting

1658 2018-11-07 20:44:30 The oil companies spent $100 million advertising against a price on carbon.
1659 2018-11-07 20:44:22 I have to wait for this oil truck to pull a load so I can test my Facility ESD 
1660 2018-11-07 20:44:10 I JUST ran out of oil lol. I was running in and out the gunstore everyday thinking they was out or sumn lol. But boom. Good lurkin
1661 2018-11-07 20:43:58 It seems you just see things only which makes you look superior. 
Though people live in slums here, we don't bomb innocent people and hospitals to have a grab of the natural resources & oil. 
Speaks lot about modern Europe. Deal with it.
1662 2018-11-07 20:43:55 @CookingIssues thanks for your help with the Carb Daiquiri. Turned out great! Recent issues with herb oils. When using 300g of rosemary in 700ml of oil. It appears to be too thick. I have had issues with the mix getting caught in the feeder assembly.
1663 2018-11-07 20:43:52 I’d say the nation could not exist w/o the oil, gas, food & goods manufactured in the flyover states. Based on utility, they lap Brooklyn or the Bronx.  If Brooklyn disappeared overnight, the nation would not skip a beat. If N Dakota and it’s oil did, we’d all feel it hard
1664 2018-11-07 20:43:38 Oil
1665 2018-11-07 20:43:34 @BBCWatchdog Why can't all items label allergy information. my daughter suffers with allergies to sesame and nuts. Finding it difficult to buy lip salve moisturiser body wash make up sun cream because of almond oil and make up.
1666 2018-11-07 20:43:33 The oil won’t break out my face?
1667 2018-11-07 20:43:31 It does anger me when, say, (someone claiming to speak for) Texas says "We're tired of shouldering the U.S.'s energy burden, but then another spokesperson turns into a whiny-ass titty-baby when oil prices drop & wants help for the state.  (Yes, you're talking about food.)
1668 2018-11-07 20:43:31 Today in 1949 “The first oil was taken in Oil Rocks (Neft Daşları), oldest offshore oil platform.” #otd #oil #nooil #envorinment #renewable #energy
1669 2018-11-07 20:43:17 I use shea butter for neck moisturizer, yes? No? Once I stop breastfeeding for good, I’ll be back on women’s vitamins, folic acid and fish oil. Any others? Thank you so much love 
1670 2018-11-07 20:43:11 We're tipping to the hard left !! LOL!! sanctuary city,   higher taxes,  oil + gas EVIL!!
1671 2018-11-07 20:43:02 Government telling fibs again. There are Irish manufacturers of CBD, I'm selling Irish manufactured CBD vape oil in my shops. Granted, most of the rest of the world is miles ahead with it. But yeah, if it were rental properties..... 
1672 2018-11-07 20:43:02 To warm you up for several nights... heat up Olive oil, drop in 1 med, diced onion.  Add minced garlic and ginger.  Let that smell awesome.  Add 1 head shredded cabbage and several cans of petite diced tomatoes, and some tomato sauce. Toss go get the cabbage covered

1676 2018-11-07 20:42:45 Get your snake oil here. I used to own used car lots & I would hire trump. He could move cars. This is why trump might do well w/ foreign leaders. He doesn't lecture like Obama he sells. Hopefully trump really does want some good things for Americans middle class & lower. We need

1679 2018-11-07 20:42:19 I can do oil changes, tires, brakes, rotors, and I've done a starter and an alternator.
1680 2018-11-07 20:42:14 I miss my yiayia’s okra in tomato sauce... And artichokes with potatoes in oil and dill... 
1681 2018-11-07 20:41:57 Lakes Oil of course. Does she have any plans for #decarbonisation and the transition for jobs? Does she know the value of clean green food for foreign markets?
1682 2018-11-07 20:41:35 Why when you get a oil change they be trying to do all this extra stuff
1683 2018-11-07 20:41:21 I’ve used conventional oil for the year I’ve had the car and it runs perfectly.
You don’t own my car, I do. I should be able to use whatever oil I wish. It’s called a free country. I will never patronize Tire Kingdom again due to your dictatorship.
1684 2018-11-07 20:41:17 Can u cook jollof spaghetti witout oil
1685 2018-11-07 20:41:16 Outcome is equal. 1 state = 1/50th representation of the United States. States dont get extra power in Senate by having more people, more oil, more ports, lower unemployment, more men, more women, or more anything. In the United States all States have equal Senate representation.
1686 2018-11-07 20:41:11 People seem to forget that one of the biggest revolutionary inventions what’s a water(steam) powered engine. Maybe not so much forget as overlook the corporate greed from oil companies but you getwuthefuckimsayin
1687 2018-11-07 20:41:11 My home state of Florida disappointed me (it frequently does) but at least they restored voting rights to 1.4 million felons and banned offshore oil drilling.
1688 2018-11-07 20:41:07 Fact that most teams Russell is bottom line is what he is saying. Also Leon did a dirty hit the first period so Oil aren’t nearly as innocent as they claim. Yes the refs sucks everywhere but target hits away from puck and laying in top is just bad and will get suspended 10/10
1689 2018-11-07 20:41:07 my issue is, my cheeks have always been "normal" but my t-zone is simultaneously greasy and flaky.... like it's just plain nasty, I can't powder too much or it's too dry but not enough powder and I'm an oil slick.... I use philosophy's renewed hope in a jar but I'm kinda

1691 2018-11-07 20:40:47 So my hubby thinks the washing machine is the reason for the hole in my sweater. It’s a perfectly round hole that had no slobber on it at all and if my dog did it it would’ve been drenched. Crossing my fingers he’s right.  Starting CBD oil with my anxious fur baby.
1692 2018-11-07 20:40:47 Speaking of oil changes I need to check my oil
1693 2018-11-07 20:40:41 My mind is completely blown by @Ocasio2018 I'm 29 and my biggest accomplishment is having my oil changed 500 miles after I was supposed to instead of 1,000
1694 2018-11-07 20:40:36 Fun stepping on Natives?

"Carnival Corporation’s executives sat down with Arctic Indigenous leaders to hear their concerns about the company’s use of heavy fuel oil in the Arctic. Carnival then turned around and dismissed their concerns as “misguided”."

1704 2018-11-07 20:39:28 It's glorious, isn't it? We just demolished one, oven roasted with a bit of oil, an onion and some thyme. Chopped feta and chilli on the side.
1705 2018-11-07 20:39:24 If Beto would’ve won, you’d be out of a job and most of all the people that work in the oil rigs would be too. All because of higher taxes that he’d put in place
1706 2018-11-07 20:39:24 My car salesman gave me The Habit veggie burger while I wait for my oil to be changed. He’s undefeated.
1707 2018-11-07 20:39:19 That's why we need Independence and freedom of movement? The oil and the energy will help too?

1710 2018-11-07 20:39:13 Oil money buys you decisions like that 
1711 2018-11-07 20:39:13 And this is why nobody likes City!  Johnny cum lately supporters who all cry wolf whilst their club routinely rorts the system on a yearly basis.  You were a nobody club before the oil money came and you can’t even sell out European Cup matches! 
1712 2018-11-07 20:39:13 Btw, measure G failed. It would have banned fracking and new oil production. I live in a super "progressive" area. Voting means very little.
1713 2018-11-07 20:39:07 It is a good thing to the Western nations and their multinational oil companies exploiting the natural resources of those places,destroying the natural vegetation and ecosystem thereby leaving the inhabitants of those places homeless and farmless.
1714 2018-11-07 20:39:05 [CN Food] Reader, if you were wondering, the pizza I went for was Zicchine, Mozzarella di Bufala and Pancetta (I was promised that, but it was in fact Speck, I am not mad at it). All topped off with copious amounts of chilli oil, which was not hot enough, btw.
1715 2018-11-07 20:39:04 Don’t think I didn’t notice the oil pump feature on the Paris badge. Brilliant.
1716 2018-11-07 20:39:02 asked my dad to change my oil for me today and I’m p sure he’s blowing me off rn
1717 2018-11-07 20:38:50 Yep, mine attacks my ankles and lower back.  I can go to bed fine and not be able to get out of bed the next day. Horrible, excruciating pain.  I find cannabis oil helps too. I hope you keep well :)

1729 2018-11-07 20:37:06 I was looking at $DO the last couple days (expecting an oil bounce that never came) so i didn't take it.  Too late?

1731 2018-11-07 20:36:50 This was my first time cooking them at home on my own, and it was SUPER easy. Literally wrap in til foil, cook for 2 hours, then peel & eat. I also sauteed the beet greens in dark cherry balsamic vinegar and vanilla bean olive oil to mix into salads and its just

1737 2018-11-07 20:35:57 Mars moves into Pisces (Oil Sign)  early next week , and Jupiter transits into Sagitarius . Also both forming a square stress aspect to each other.  If this doesn't light a fire under oil second half of November , not sure what will -news- Extremists , and Middle east tensions
1738 2018-11-07 20:35:57 When I get off , I have to wash my hair and do a hot oil treatment!!
1739 2018-11-07 20:35:52 Any particular reason for this one? Whole space kinda banged up with the recent drop in oil.

1741 2018-11-07 20:35:43 Probably, I believe our movement away from oil (And its prices) will happen way before we run out of it. After 2030 it will become more niche.

1751 2018-11-07 20:34:10 I believe you may be ignoring some trends about Texas, which complicates the simple narrative: 1) Texas economy is still very oil driven, a sector with a unique culture & natural-resource rents as a goal, plus a rich source of money for cultivating conservative causes.

1754 2018-11-07 20:33:52 - U.S. pumps more oil than Saudi Arabia and Russia.

- Went from building LNG import terminals to creating a huge oversupply      of natural gas.

Never discount human ingenuity.

1788 2018-11-07 20:29:51 If there is crude oil its easier for a country to be despotic.  Revenue = Power. In a sense its a bane to have Crude oil. Natural resource curse makes manufacturing less competitive, fewer good jobs. Australia-China is an exception.

1798 2018-11-07 20:27:45 Gas has to do with the oil industry + taxes. Cali is more expensive due to regulations trying to dissuade driving. Housing has to do with land value, taxes and other things. Seeing as mountainous, oceanous, Cali has more to look at than Odessa, it'll cost more.

1815 2018-11-07 20:25:33 Who’s behind climate change denial? Big oil! Billionaires who will lose money/profits if you act to protect your planet! You know, the same corporate types who fought the science aimed at tobacco! They made profits while users of their products die terrible deaths! U trust them?!

1817 2018-11-07 20:25:26 My oil is straight from Iraq
1818 2018-11-07 20:25:24 The representative is only chasing shadows. Age wouldn’t matter to employers if the economy is doing great. If you don’t believe me go to shale gas/oil towns in west Texas and see how retired folks are being employed by companies who are short of qualified hands.
1819 2018-11-07 20:25:21 Awww!  But don't you have this sweet new oil to fix any messing?
1820 2018-11-07 20:25:13 was supposed to get my oil changed instead i got baked and hit up jack n the box AND wendys . fwm
1821 2018-11-07 20:25:09 3 and final. Manufacturing in car makers scale is a well oiled machine. If someone threatened to stick a spanner in the works and make it difficult to oil your machine, you would take that business to a place where your business wouldn't be harmed for no reason.
1822 2018-11-07 20:25:07 What worried me is that a lot of consultancies are still promoting online-only as a panacea for enrollment woes the way full-freight international students were 7-8 years ago. Outliers like ASU, SNHU, WGU skew the numbers & support this snake oil.
1823 2018-11-07 20:25:07 Oil change, car wash, nail appointment today since I’m off early
1824 2018-11-07 20:24:59 Спасибо огромное
1825 2018-11-07 20:24:41 Well that and the fact that 4/8 countries the Trump admin exempted from penalties from the Iran deal are the largest buyers of Iranian oil.
1826 2018-11-07 20:24:39 Also can we call them fake oils? Vegetable oils are not appropriate, vegetables are healthy. Seed oils exclude soybean oil which is just as terrible. Refined oils sound like they are fancy oils. Processed oils are not specific enough. Chemically processed oils are too long.
1827 2018-11-07 20:24:36 If I can make a suggestion, the same thing happens to me so when that happens I get lavendar oil and rub some on my wrist and right behind my ears, always works.
1828 2018-11-07 20:24:34 Internally bonded oil tanks for central heating oil...
1829 2018-11-07 20:24:33 BTW, you seem like you are a fucking idiot. Probably a coward like our President too. But what do I know. I'm an insane Democrat from a multi-generational GOP family. Maybe I drank the wrong Kool Aid... It maybe when I see a snake oil salesman, I know it's a con. Good luck?
1830 2018-11-07 20:24:27 @aveeksen Is the news true that Iran is getting some international firms to expand its crude oil production and export quantities?
1831 2018-11-07 20:24:24 Enjoy getting that dirty oil money every week pal maybe you should Google Abu Dhabi

1835 2018-11-07 20:23:51 That makes no sense, Russia has all the oil it needs already.

1839 2018-11-07 20:22:51 True. The CEO is on 95k a year tooLest we forget? Bollocks. Stop sending them to oil wars for the rich. Stop rough sleeping and suicidal veterans and fund their PTSD treatment . Stuff yer poppies. It’s hypocritical. 
1840 2018-11-07 20:22:49 None of these candidates; the BIG 5 formally endorsed 112 for safer setbacks from new oil and gas; in fact one of them Brittany Pettersen formally opposed it and another Jessie Danielson took nearly $5k from pipefitters and $$$ from Norm Brownstein; #bluewavewithbloodmoney
1841 2018-11-07 20:22:45 I need some cannabis oil
1842 2018-11-07 20:22:42 If you’re saying Kris Russell is a top player, maybe the Oil is in a lot worse shape than previously thought....

1844 2018-11-07 20:22:40 We are taking about crude oil mate, not financial markets. They are quite different.
1845 2018-11-07 20:22:26 Sir, You too endorsing the Issue ?????? Amazed !!!! Never thought an Army man who respects every religion would take this type initiative.

1849 2018-11-07 20:22:04 The oil industry contributed most of the more than $31 million raised by the No on 1631 campaign.
1850 2018-11-07 20:22:03 Claiming he has been getting oil prices down, their have been going up.

When asked about the issues with voting in Georgia, he immediately says he isn't at fault for it...  Guilty much?  Clearly that should be an interesting point of investigation...
1851 2018-11-07 20:21:53 Did you tell those veterans about your handing those lands off to the oil and gas industry ? 

Asking for a friend
1852 2018-11-07 20:21:43 Today's figures. Tomorrows will be? Wait for impact on jobs from fuel taxes and banning exploration Oil And Gas. Adverse impacts hit Taranaki and Southland and permeate whole economy. And for what benefit to our Nation and its people? Destruction by UN sycophant.
1853 2018-11-07 20:21:42 But then the Lagos factor came in. 

You come to the SouthSouth and nothing is really going for the youths down here unless you are in the oil and gas sector or politics. 

Sports and Entertainment is not really where  it should be in SouthSouth.

1862 2018-11-07 20:20:26 Quick question, why would the Oilers need a pass on last night's game? They played fine but were beat by a superior team that has a world-class netminder.
1863 2018-11-07 20:20:24 Congratulations to the Democrats for flipping the house last night. Armed with the power to investigate and subpoena, it is time to make Trump fry in his own oil. #ImpeachTrump

1866 2018-11-07 20:20:13 Out to get an oil change. The guy tells me a look like a hippie. He then says he knows a lot of hippies and woke people. He avoids them at all costs.

Umm, fuck you very much?
1867 2018-11-07 20:20:12 Venezuela. They have oil. Brazil will help.

50/50
1868 2018-11-07 20:20:08 Indexes are leading indicators of economic expansion. Expansion = greater demand for oil and higher prices. Disconnect here either means an oversupply of oil or a bubble in equities, probably both imo.
1869 2018-11-07 20:20:06 Is it not good that this resource is reserved not to be depleted like oil and gas in Niger delta. Jos is now a shadow of itself.
1870 2018-11-07 20:19:40 10yr..oil...Inflation..it's all connected.

1872 2018-11-07 20:19:21 That’s Scotland’s  oil and gas.
1873 2018-11-07 20:19:09 If the West stops supporting the Saud Terrorist family, none of these would happen. The West needs to stop installing Arab dictators and start buying oil at regular prices, instead of getting the oil for free from these savage dictators.
1874 2018-11-07 20:19:04 but Ted Cruz.  but Louie Gohmert.  but Joe Barton.  but Greg Abbott.  but Rick Perry.  but Blake Farenthold.

1880 2018-11-07 20:18:18 How long since you checked, or had someone check, your oil and belts?  Or try starting the car with the hood up, jump out and see if you can tell where that noise is coming from?  And maybe take a picture of the area.
1881 2018-11-07 20:18:07 Joking aside... I do also take Starflower Oil capsules regularly. I do think I feel better each month when I take them as I stopped once and seemed to notice the difference. Can't prove anything but might help some people.
1882 2018-11-07 20:18:04 They used sunflower oil. How do we know it's the omega 6 and not some other feature of fake oils? Solvents, rancid omega 6, trans fats, stearic acid, unnatural fat composition, dihydro vitamin K1, or other hydrogenated compounds.
Nuts and seeds do not seem to cause heart disease.
1883 2018-11-07 20:17:58 they have them around machinery that spills liquid as part of the process (oil mostly) and also around furnaces to catch any molten spillages

1901 2018-11-07 20:15:40 Our kids weren’t fussy, any of them would do, except the one with  fish oil (Omega-3)...that one always came back up. Once ours hit 1 year old....standard milk all the way (along with solid foods etc)
1902 2018-11-07 20:15:37 Yes but not all josb, cites, or states are the same. The highest paying for a student that I’ve heard here is $16 & most of these jobs start @ $9. Living in the Permian basin where the oil field hits the most with all the high prices isn’t easy for the ones who help our parents.
1903 2018-11-07 20:15:29 @Rosie I see from a friend that you liked my song Snake Oil Salesman, This has made me so happy. Thank you so much!

1910 2018-11-07 20:14:23 1/He's right; valuable source of Ω-3 most Americans don't get enough of. I've switched to walnuts after figuring out other nuts not as rich.

1911 2018-11-07 20:14:21 I wish someone else was there to see the look my dad gave me when I told him ~*just*~ how overdue my car was for an oil change.  He didn’t look at me. He looked through me.

1922 2018-11-07 20:13:07 Sir, you are missing a larger point. Every fuel comes with political, security -related, environmental etc issues. Are you discriminating russian gas against saudi oil? Difficult take these days...

1924 2018-11-07 20:12:30 So the consensus is with Peterson is that he says pseudo-intellectual self-help nonsesne to give really fragile or dumb people a sense of self-worth - does that describe you?

1939 2018-11-07 20:10:59 Diwali is symbolic of Light taking over darkness and is celebrated once a year. The diyas we lit with oil kills bacterias and purifies environment.

1946 2018-11-07 20:10:32 What boils me is that cracking oil for diesel costs LESS than gasoline. The Koch brothers turned that upside down to screw OTR drivers. Bastards.
1947 2018-11-07 20:10:24 Hi, there! I personally love coconut oil! It can be clogging, but I find it to be really helpful in managing dry combination skin. Oils tend to get a bad rep IMO.

1957 2018-11-07 20:09:17 Have been long Uranium for 18 months, Struggling to see how the market will improve dramatically if oil continues its fall.  Perhaps supply destruction will bring the spot price back to the $40 range, but can't say I'm not concerned with alt energy prices falling.  #Uranium

You are allllll for having a human self sacrifice their LIFE for some oil but notttt about self sacrificing money (that you have more than one human needs) in your pockets to help living humans who NEED it??? Is this correct??
1960 2018-11-07 20:08:53 While we are busy thinking of ourselves being either more special or less special, indians have taken over manufacturing and distribution of cooking oil, cake flour and paint tins in this country.

1972 2018-11-07 20:07:00 Jimmy was decades ahead of his time. My father got a great job in solar energy research under Jimmy's watch.
Had we follow the path Jimmy showed us, we wouldn't have been dependent on foreign oil for decades.
Jimmy was fiscally responsible UNLIKE all his successors, but WJC.

1992 2018-11-07 20:03:42 I reckon likely places will have a combination of high renewable energy potential, existing industrial clusters around ports. So the Persian Gulf, Port of LA/Long Beach, Korea and Japan. Part of tanker biz will be transporting ZEFs around, just like fuel oil now
1993 2018-11-07 20:03:31 Tetrahydrocannabinol is one of at least 113 cannabinoids identified in cannabis. If your driver needs the oil for medical reasons get a note, the law has been changed recently. Otherwise sack him, he's driving a train with paying customers on it
1994 2018-11-07 20:03:30 More a cancerous spread of urban democratic policies to suburbs. Even the effect of more people living in neighborhoods controlled by HOA's, conditions people to become subservient to authority/government control. They just accept it, they have no choice

2007 2018-11-07 20:02:03 Don’t blame the oil companies for higher gasoline prices when Nevada, Texas, Georgia, etc pay about $2.00 less per gallon. Californians love taxes. If proposition was too confusing for you to understand, then you should be voting at all.

Yet right across the street were plenty of trees with leaves on it. Oil leaches into the soil. These trees will need to be replaced every few years.

2080 2018-11-07 19:52:33 Trump manipulation, it is green light for prices to go back up again soon as the mid election is over. Time to increase revenue and save the oil sector job
2081 2018-11-07 19:52:32 A wonderful exhibition - as good as the Rembrandt a couple of years back. I was mesmerised by how Bellini improved over time, especially when he moved to oil. Mantegna was always brilliant and unimprovable.
2082 2018-11-07 19:52:25 There's no oil extraction in Oslo. But Norway needs to stop drilling for oil, I've dedicated years of my life to trying to bring that about. A lot of cities can learn from what Oslo is doing on rapid emission reduction.
2083 2018-11-07 19:52:15 Also coming from the lesser educated oil labor worker population that doesn’t realize Cruz doesn’t actually care about them just the money coming from industry
2084 2018-11-07 19:51:53 I think that anyone complaining about "Big bad oil companies" should have to walk everywhere, stop using anything that's powered by gas, oil or electricity, grow/hunt your own food and make your own clothes. If you're not willing, then stfu. The amish are looking for recruits.
2085 2018-11-07 19:51:51 But let’s keep buying their oil because we want to go cleaner.. what a flipping joke

2087 2018-11-07 19:51:02 What a bullshit headline this is @macleans. A bunch of old white guys defending their rich oil baron pals is hardly a resistance, and certainly not one worth profiling. I guess there's not much editorial freedom left at Rogers media is there.

2091 2018-11-07 19:50:31 Do you even know the regulations that we have on production on oil ..it’s crazy we are the number one heavily regulated in the world and Saudia is zero no regulations

2105 2018-11-07 19:49:08 Could be eczema! What i normally do is wash with warm water and a mild soap (any bar soap like dove) and apply a non fragrant moisturizer like coconut oil! I also use ice packs to help with the swelling!! I hope any of this is helpful for you!!
2106 2018-11-07 19:48:42 We agree! This all comes back to knowing your audience and knowing your brand's core values. Promote what you believe in and the rest will follow. Dawn emphasizes environmental impact through oil spill cleanup but this doesn't ostracize conservative audiences. #AdweekChat
2107 2018-11-07 19:48:40 Thought I was about to get a $20 oil change, no ma’am. “$40?” I’m sick of being grown!
2108 2018-11-07 19:48:24 Is that really weird?

Brussels sprouts can be awesome! But they definitely need either butter or olive oil and pepper. Not potato chips. This is very British cuisine of British Lays.
2109 2018-11-07 19:48:23 ICE just got done getting her tires rotated and oil change . She’s a whole new bitchhh 
2110 2018-11-07 19:48:15 I’d pay for his oil change any day.

2113 2018-11-07 19:48:05 Talking about a national popular vote for senate seats, only 1/3 of which come up in any given election, is dumb enough. But to drive it home this year - neither I nor the other 7M+ CA voters last night even had a republican option the ballot for senator
2114 2018-11-07 19:48:02 i mean, at least we know Florida hates dudebros and big oil assholes.

2119 2018-11-07 19:47:51 Yeah I'm just speaking on Texas. They aren't draining money out of Texas. They just feed it back into our oil companies which isn't any better but at least it's staying in the state. Texans may think left ideas are nice BUT we aren't willing to give up our way of life for it.
2120 2018-11-07 19:47:34 So apparently they want to rush two oil rigs that don’t go out till the end of the month, yea ok that makes perfect sense buddy

2129 2018-11-07 19:47:02 True. Though I don’t pay $5000 annually in heating oil,  nor pay state income taxes, nor pay large property taxes, nor pay large gas taxes. I also don’t need to pay for emissions, nor car repairs to fix emission problems.

2133 2018-11-07 19:46:44 It's absolutely incoherent as a logical argument. Jesus was also anointed with oil and baptized. Are those things bad?

A person who actually makes that statement is so deficient in their ability to reason that it's probably futile to engage them in an argument.
2134 2018-11-07 19:46:42 Agree, path to beating the snake oil salesman a tough one, many ppl are very naive and easily fooled.

2137 2018-11-07 19:46:23 The US are reducing net imports, that is correct, but production methods inside the US are costly, and harming the environment, as well as contaminating water reserves.
I hope, with the right policies, oil consumption decreases, and self reliance increases further.

We'll see.
2138 2018-11-07 19:46:23 I even have a massage oil
2139 2018-11-07 19:45:53 Our very honorable oil will not fight.
2140 2018-11-07 19:45:40 No, the world needs a significant drop in oil production.

What do you want me to say, “you’re right, the gun that shoots me dead should be ethically made.” Nah, imma say “no, no, I don’t want to be shot.”

2157 2018-11-07 19:42:40 Everyone knows this.. the point is that we STILL USE OIL and we buy it from SAUDI with no NO REGULATIONS on producing it.. we need to slowing introduce new ways .. but the point is we need CANADIAN OIL which is the best made product on the market.. and the world needs OUR OIL

2165 2018-11-07 19:41:52 Do you mean Democrats like PA Governor Tom Wolf that supports fracking and the oil/gas industry? Greens provided the only choice on the ballot to protect the environment. We hope you'll reconsider and support the Green Party in future elections.

2167 2018-11-07 19:41:49 I don’t for a minute buy the crap about it being about saving the world .

It’s much bigger and darker then green .
2168 2018-11-07 19:41:47 In a perfect world yes but with this roster, they really shouldn't be. But remember, the GM knows the moves he made a few years back "were the right things to do. And you stand by that".  #Oilers

2178 2018-11-07 19:39:47 Interesting...it's like China never entered the WTO at all. If oil joins in further, could see a repeat of 2014 collapse as shale producers get caught in cash flow hell again. Interest rate markets start to look really interesting if that plays out imo.

2212 2018-11-07 19:36:25 Are you suggesting we no longer use oil and gas for energy? If so, how do you propose we replace the energy source and sustain the existing quality of life in the US?
2213 2018-11-07 19:36:09 So buying oil from Saudi with NO STANDARDS and the WORST made product available which Canada buys for 17 billion a year.. is better than supporting jobs and loosing billions a day to FOREIGN companies is a way better option which is clearly what you are saying
2214 2018-11-07 19:36:08 5/@NNPCgroup explained that domestic crude oil of 445,000 bpd was allocated for refining to meet domestic products supply, and payments were effected to the Federation Account by NNPC...
2215 2018-11-07 19:36:08 Putting this in context, if I told you is "cheaper" to produce oil in the middle East and so we could buy it cheaper, therefore we shouldn't produce our own. 

Would be stupid right?..... Well, extrapolate that to outsourcing all our goods production to China and others....
2216 2018-11-07 19:36:08 i’m getting my oil changed and all i fucking know is that better be ALL I’m getting today
2217 2018-11-07 19:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2218 2018-11-07 19:35:44 Indomie with out oil is like girls with out make up
2219 2018-11-07 19:35:42 need my oil changed soo bad, if i wait any longer i’m gonna ruin my car. but i never have time
2220 2018-11-07 19:35:39 Well conservatives dont want to put money into these other engery sources . I went to their conference here in halifax and they believe oil is the way to go . Cost less for startup then oil . Trudeau is trying to work with both and they pick at him over it
2221 2018-11-07 19:35:36 Someone spreading rumours they found Salty Custard in R1/R2 instead of Oil! He panicked few & retail rushed to the doors ... just FUD
2222 2018-11-07 19:35:31 It’s feels amazing! I used rose petals, rosemary, lavender and peppermint essential oil, cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.
2223 2018-11-07 19:35:25 Let’s try this: I grew up a stone’s throw away from an oil refinery, so I know that, if you disagree with me, you clearly, uhhh, support puppy farms.
2224 2018-11-07 19:35:23 That’s why your car gets shit oil and will break down in the end
2225 2018-11-07 19:35:16 Oil man? Wot you on about yer fruitbat?
2226 2018-11-07 19:35:10 Fun n #Colorado blue as said by all #California #transplants but oops all their freebie tax hikes & anti oil agendas got hammered no thanks so ur elected but we ain’t paying for it steal ur money from pot sales as all officials do and shall I say F off enjoy have a great day
2227 2018-11-07 19:35:08 رد عليه يا ضاحي .. خن نشوف 
2228 2018-11-07 19:35:04 Well, our people have a saying, "it's not the day that a child spills the oil that he gets beaten, it might be the day he throws away an empty jar that contained oil"
2229 2018-11-07 19:35:03 From the sale of oil alone this nation can run it's budget leaving other areas like: NLNG, Customs, Tax, Revenues from MDAs all to be saved

But alas.... It's a conundrum!
2230 2018-11-07 19:35:02 I lament the loss of Gillum, but am somewhat intrigued to see Florida Republican leadership continue to deny climate change as Miami goes underwater-- gotta pay back Big Oil for their campaign contributions!!
2231 2018-11-07 19:35:01 Trading convergence in stocks vs oil seems risky. Not saying they’re not periodically correlated, but they can also diverge significantly. Imagine if lower oil reflects lesser geopolitical risks, weighs on breakevens and bond yields. Sounds pretty bullish equities yes?
2232 2018-11-07 19:34:47 Who tryna bring yo boy some cooking oil??
2233 2018-11-07 19:34:44 You know that saying "80% of success is just showing up." Apparently Dunleavy is exempt from that rule. In Alaska you can run a shit campaign with no substance and still win off of Republican endorsements and oil money 
#akelect #akgov
2234 2018-11-07 19:34:35 I’m a big advocate for tinted moisturizers!! It doesn’t cake on, it’ll just color correct your skin instead of hiding everything. They moisturize instead of just pure oil, and they typically all have a level of SPF in them!!
2235 2018-11-07 19:34:35 Trudeau......do right thing.......oil and water.
2236 2018-11-07 19:34:31 And would grid demand rise? How much power is the grid wasting now overnight? There are many factors.
The biggest factor is if people don't have an EV (or ebike) at home, they won't be ready to shut down mining, drilling, and refining of oil (which needs to end next decade).
2237 2018-11-07 19:34:12 Gammon cooked in snake oil.
2238 2018-11-07 19:34:08 He said he wanted the kids to "barrell rush him", knowing he had dumped them in barrell's of crude oil. Monster
2239 2018-11-07 19:34:04 Where do you get to buy this stuff?? I need some of that beard oil
2240 2018-11-07 19:33:56 Several black grief merchants/snake oil salesmen will be happy with yesterday's results.

They can continue to preach that "your vote doesn't matter" narrative while soliciting donations to fund their family vacations or imaginary community outreach.
2241 2018-11-07 19:33:55 Please what was the word of caution? At the endx God this is too painful to watch this man is an evil himself, such denials 
2242 2018-11-07 19:33:52 AT $142 PER BARREL OF OIL, 27 STATES COULDN'T PAY SALARIES BUT AT $27 PER BARREL IN 2015 BUHARI BAILED THEM OUT!

 INTEGRITY MATTERS!
2243 2018-11-07 19:33:42 Is syrup of figs worse than Castor oil ?
2244 2018-11-07 19:33:39 Oil man !! Shur up will ya
2245 2018-11-07 19:33:33 I wish I wore my yellow ass cuco shirt today instead of this Ben Davis shirt I look like I can jump start your car and check your oil which I can do btw
2246 2018-11-07 19:33:32 Look at the small boy that started to know what is going on in Nigeria recently talking abt CJTF & BH. Ignoring d idiot ll mek him continue.

2248 2018-11-07 19:33:07 I wanto fry and I don't want the oil to splash on your body.
2249 2018-11-07 19:33:00 Me swear me need to stop use vegetable oil a true coconut oil expensive and me can't bother make me own cuz wat I gonna do with all that custard
2250 2018-11-07 19:32:56 Completely agree. This was shocking to me in my home state. King County heavily went for it, but oil companies won in the rest of the state. Does not bode well for the future of the planet (or politics).

2256 2018-11-07 19:32:15 To say SouthIndns do not celebrate Diwali is to say we don't breathe in oxygen. As a SI child, I cant remember a single Diwali when my mom did not give me an oil bath, dress me up in best new clothes, make me pray, offer me de choicest sweets and spoil me silly with firecrackers.
2257 2018-11-07 19:32:15 I have to believe it was the massive amounts of money the oil companies spent in making it as confusing as possible
2258 2018-11-07 19:32:01 @TyJohnsonNews Quote of the day- Chick-fil-A will change your oil for you
2259 2018-11-07 19:32:01 Considering how much it cost, I should. I just don’t trust myself with my general clumsiness. Oil changes I should definitely do, though.
2260 2018-11-07 19:31:51 20 years ago I looked after a fleet of oil trucks, they were on the road 7 days a week and I was on call 24/7. I didn't feel well, couldn't sleep  & ended up with reflux. My doc did bloods & was told I was suffering from stress. It's a killer and you don't even know you have it
2261 2018-11-07 19:31:50 your engine can seize up. oil is lubrication for your engine. so ... you can use your imagination
2262 2018-11-07 19:31:43 You'd think he'd get it by now-- we haven't bought his snake oil for a long time-- in fact, some of us were never subscribers.

2264 2018-11-07 19:31:37 So in your opinion Real Madrid should have matched PSG’s offer? Thank God you are not the president because you are will run this club into bankruptcy. Nobody can match City and PSG’s oil money

2267 2018-11-07 19:31:22 Fact check everything Trump says! He is a spoiled “old” man who let his daddy teach him how to bully people. His history of lying is incredible. He is a snake oil salesman, lie lie lie, alter reality to fit his inability to be truthful!!!!

2282 2018-11-07 19:29:50 Big oil winning in WA 
2283 2018-11-07 19:29:38 The middle East nations who had a monopoly on oil production massive deceased supply. This is my point about national and economic security of not being dependent on foreigners for all goods. Same applies with high tech industrial goods involved in tech and military products.

2287 2018-11-07 19:29:14 Hopefully she jetted off to get some hair conditioner or a hot oil treatment. Stay out of the chlorine and sun!
2288 2018-11-07 19:29:07 Last time they changed the oil, the @Hyundai dealer put the filter on so tight I actually had to struggle to get it off even with a wrench.
2289 2018-11-07 19:29:02 you ve had your oil light on for like 2 months lol
2290 2018-11-07 19:28:58 I'm always annoyed by ppl advising Trump, bc he's a genius. But if I were advising him, I'd have him try 250 mg of CBD oil sublinguil prior to his next presser. 

My cousin's friend's brother told me that it's very calming. 
2291 2018-11-07 19:28:46 There are a limited number of basins with the potential for large high rate frack candidates. We are running out of oil @El_Spy
2292 2018-11-07 19:28:24 It's not the same thing but I'm trying to gauge the level at which you'll defend this sort of thing. If Game and Watch's down-B turned him into an anti-semetic depiction of a jew and he used a money bag to collect attacks instead of an oil bucket, would you defend that?
2293 2018-11-07 19:28:24 A3: they must show relevancy to showing their audience that they know and understand them--use language and imagery that their audience would relate to. @DawnDish does great work with their campaigns on cleaning animals from oil spills. They've done this for decades! #AdweekChat
2294 2018-11-07 19:28:11 Quick ? for those who follow my music. I have so many good songs that didn't make my projects Venus, Silver and Oil. Does anyone think I should make a project out of these songs? Or leave them unheard?
2295 2018-11-07 19:27:59 Got to love the oil field. When they say go you go... stop drop and get that American oil....

2298 2018-11-07 19:27:26 and now just for fun, go to the annual reports of big oil etc and see their commitment to climate change... ha!
2299 2018-11-07 19:27:18 I never change my own oil. I’m not a peasant
2300 2018-11-07 19:27:16 i put a little too much argan oil in my hair this morning so we a lil greasy but we smell good so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2301 2018-11-07 19:27:10 Turns out he didn't have any weedkiller at plot, but there might possibly be some oil. Never mind, let's move on, plot 14 is trying to trade their veg for gold, can't have that. @InstituteGC
2302 2018-11-07 19:27:10 I know exactly what is going on.. because I live in the oil patch ..it’s clear you that does not have a clue what is happening
2303 2018-11-07 19:27:10 make sure it's something cool.. like gold, platinum or even latinum ;)
i will also accept olive oil scraped off the muscles of gladiators.
2304 2018-11-07 19:26:39 I wanna work at the oil refinery with my cousin but i cannot b away from home that long 
2305 2018-11-07 19:26:39 Cmon pal: high oil price = higher inflation = Fed stay hawkish = rate hikes = equities lower = sad Donald
2306 2018-11-07 19:26:26 Ya well mobs tend to uncontrollably yell so...
2307 2018-11-07 19:26:23 dyed black hair on fair-skinned people who have naturally medium or light hair color can look good, but in my experience it often looks like they done dipped their head in crude oil lmao
2308 2018-11-07 19:26:21 Right! Trains and trucks are better for transporting oil.
2309 2018-11-07 19:26:16 If you're interested in trying out a CBD oil, let us know! We'd love to answer any questions you may have 
2310 2018-11-07 19:25:58 A state with no oil and far from enough proven natural gas reserves is going to get drilled and fracked. Gotcha
2311 2018-11-07 19:25:29 ummmm liquid, like oil I'm sure.
2312 2018-11-07 19:25:22 I don't think you're unqualified for all, but it's also a pretty bad list. Floor level employment is "retail, food service, clerical work, and factories" not "take one of the many oil rig or foreign language instructor positions being offered to everyone".
2313 2018-11-07 19:25:16 You don't have to tell or convince people that you are anointed....the OIL will speak for itself!!
2314 2018-11-07 19:25:02 Make sure to apply oils at night like vitamin E oil with moisturizer on top

2316 2018-11-07 19:24:49 @Meredith_Adler are you aware that a pro oil organization tweeted about you to try to Greenwash themselves? They are pushing for fracking and tar sands pipelines on Canada's east coast
2317 2018-11-07 19:24:48 prop 6 failed. Just wait till oil prices start to go up and roads are still broken. But this is cleptofornia.
2318 2018-11-07 19:24:40 I only saw the last 20 minutes and he must have lied 10 times! At one point he claimed that he controlled the global price of oil!!!
2319 2018-11-07 19:24:37 *takes your top off and gets some massage oil, sits behind you and rubs it in slowly*
2320 2018-11-07 19:24:23 Lol...I have this snake oil to sell you...
2321 2018-11-07 19:24:21 You live under a rock, don’t you? Obama said Trump would need a magic wand to bring jobs back.  Trump has opened up oil production so we are now the biggest supplier in the world. He also is giving us clean coal while Obozo shut the coal mines down.

2330 2018-11-07 19:23:26 Just look at the oil price spike in '08, and what followed for the answer to this question
2331 2018-11-07 19:23:21 There's even oil at the edge of the water. It's just ridiculously detailed. That said, I still crashed into a rock on my horse and died.

2335 2018-11-07 19:22:30 I honestly don’t think long ago a kingdom with walls would look out and say “Oh look we have thousands of migrants coming” no them would report to the king that there are invaders coming and they would close the gates and the invaders would be met with hot oil and flaming arrows

2342 2018-11-07 19:21:32 If this happens expect gold and mines to be nationalized. US/global militaries treating assets like they do oil now.  No government allows a private mine with 1500 USD production cost with 10,000 market value.  Seigniorage properties transferred from printing press to mines

2360 2018-11-07 19:19:28 cbd oil is great for many people but hippie facebook moms have got to stop peddling it as a miracle cure-all
2361 2018-11-07 19:19:24 Yes i agree. I have not taken meds personally ad i dont tbink i ever will. Your right tho the side effects are worse then what your actually going thru. I know you know this already but cbd oil is the way to go
2362 2018-11-07 19:19:16 Yep. A few tweets about how she assaulted him and the trolls flock. They care nothing about women of these issues, just the end game.
2363 2018-11-07 19:19:16 True, all you have to do is pay for the oil
2364 2018-11-07 19:19:00 I’m am so pleased with Colorado today. The Dems took governor, I have a Dem rep in congress for the first time, we have a Dem as treasurer, sec of state, attorney general. Disappointed the set backs for oil and gas didn’t win but school funding did for Douglas county.

2369 2018-11-07 19:18:42 I can’t watch him - his answers are garbage and he clearly hasn’t a clue what he is talking about. When he says “that’s because of me” - can someone ask him what specific policies lead to a global drop in oil prices that he enacted ?
2370 2018-11-07 19:18:32 The oil was there a long time ago. Today capitalist oil extraction is elsewhere, like Alaska, but the engineering is still in Houston.
2371 2018-11-07 19:18:26 Won't be surprised with using water, bells and oil lamps in pooja are banned soon to protect environment. Clearly Supreme court finds butchering of animals and humans by other religions eco-friendly or their human right, not to be meddled with.

2376 2018-11-07 19:17:57 Actually making poppadoms or anything else involving hot oil terrifies me (I still have a scar from an incident involving tempura), but I'm doing it anyway because those things are bloody worth facing terror for.
2377 2018-11-07 19:17:56 Yes but i saw that massive oil tanker in the background fortunately!

2388 2018-11-07 19:16:52 Britain is probably not gonna give  it up. The people from the Falklands wants to stay british and the british government wants it to stay british. Plus, the islands are full of oil, so you'll probably get more from them than you give anyway.
2389 2018-11-07 19:16:47 (Thoughts while waiting for an oil change) I know Halloween just passed, but I think I want to be a slutty, greasy mechanic. Hmm 
2390 2018-11-07 19:16:46 I know all my first generation cousins living out in the rural areas working in the oil companies have strong ties to the white evangelical church. They were told to vote for Ted Cruz because you know, the Bible. I don’t know how to get through to them. 
2391 2018-11-07 19:16:36 Nothing like oil change to start the day man . Happy HUMP DAY

2395 2018-11-07 19:15:47 Horrific although diesel not much cheaper here may I add. Petrol not far off too blame oil industries for that one. Worst worries seems to be crime and immigration still Paris being an absolute ghetto in places and more so than it used to be

While Saudi Arabia is committing crimes against humanity and we dare speak out they threaten us with... well that doesn't matter they are still willing to sell us oil. Oil that we can produce ourselves. But wait ! Shouldn't we be legalizing sodomy for minors instead?

2401 2018-11-07 19:15:16 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this November? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
2402 2018-11-07 19:15:05 I’m not like other girls ... i freak out when i see my oil light on... it’s a must i go get my shit change soon as it pops up!
2403 2018-11-07 19:15:00 Oil engineering in Houston makes sense because the oil and oil distribution is there. If tech firms are based on creativity and they want to attract the best people, they could base in cheaper cities/regions and their starting packages would be that much more attractive.

When is the last time u have seen a story on oil anything?
How many oil rigs in the oceans...where in the oceans...which countries do we get all our oil from...how do they insure they r safe out there?
What r the plans 4 future drilling..how much left?
2406 2018-11-07 19:14:42 oil is not rallying b/c oversupplied conditions and fear of global slowdown -- seems as those traders have some common sense in what is coming in 2019 -- as for equity auctions -- its just squeeze euphoria

If he is able to stoke demand, and debt cost inflation, the ROW oil producers will benefit, while US producers sell for lower real net back and net revenue. That I, in EBITDA, matters!

2412 2018-11-07 19:13:42 A lot of shops use 5w-30 as the standard oil. Not all cars are specified for that weight. On top of that, oil changes that cheap are only using conventional oils.I’ve seen shops charge $60+ for synthetic when I can buy the oil for half that. DIY for less overall damage to the car

(same question, from whence would they go - to Israel) & then? 2) pops was very much against going thru Turkey.  Did Papa have a single deal, ever? Would not take much to arrange El-Sisi.

2421 2018-11-07 19:12:43 I mean technically we all pay for oil changes. If you do it yourself you still have to buy the oil and the filter..

2450 2018-11-07 19:10:31 I guess it seems like the indicator just needs to be reset. Doesn’t make sense it needs an oil change with 900 miles on the odometer? Do I have to go in for that?

2463 2018-11-07 19:09:45 I know what Patchouli is.

2472 2018-11-07 19:07:59 I don't know about nondigital art so I can't tell if you've made any mistakes, but as a layman I think it's really pretty! the oil makes it seem sort of vintage in a nice way! I hope you can be proud of working hard and making something nice even if it isn't technically perfect.

2476 2018-11-07 19:07:48 Chase. You’re plain wrong. It’s not a scam. You are an EARLY investor. You’re buying “oil” before BP or Exxon has started refining it. “Crypto” is 99.9% scam. #XRP is the future of fintech and possibly the IMF’s new SDR or a world reserve currency. Just relax and HODL bro.

2482 2018-11-07 19:06:54 Haha stop being so dramatic.  You're gonna be fine.  A heart break is nothing more than just a oil scratch internal parts of your body.  You'll heal and then date again, then ba go nyise futhi

2489 2018-11-07 19:05:46 So what can we eat? Eggs were bad as they have cholesterol,but now ok as it's "the good kind'.Butter was bad but now ok as it's natural.Sugar is bad but saccharin is carcinogenic. Red meat is bad but rich in iron, heated veg oil becomes carcinogenic, so now use lard when frying!!
2490 2018-11-07 19:05:46 Exactly. Tea Tree oil  has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antifungal properties. Salicylic Acid comes from a Willow tree, now used in Aspirin. Lavender oil brilliant treatment for burns, scalds. Natural products came before chemical copies.

2496 2018-11-07 19:05:21 There is something good which has come out of Measure 1631, despite the fact that it was defeated. Oil interests threw 31 million dollars at it, and still only barely kept it from becoming law. Put it on the ballot again WA, and drain those companies penny by penny.
2497 2018-11-07 19:05:14 Only a moron, or the King of Saudi Arabia would claim oil prices came down because of themselves. Which one do you think Donald Trump is?

2500 2018-11-07 19:04:42 WA voters succumbed to big oil and the soda industry, however:
-we failed to pass what would have been the United States' first-ever tax on carbon
-we banned local govts from taxing soda and sugary drinks, which was the soda industry's response to Seattle's 2018 soda tax

2512 2018-11-07 19:03:34 Not one to get all political, but I hope everyone enjoys riding their bikes... cause voting out oil field means no gas in your cars to go where you want and also rising taxes because the state is no longer getting taxes from oil production... so have fun with that...
2513 2018-11-07 19:03:22 Indian must ban these ads showing Indians going temple right after an oil bath. In reality we wake up at 5am and began stressing the hell out wondering if we could finish cooking by noon.

2538 2018-11-07 19:00:31 Look up the Rothschild banking oil cartel.
2539 2018-11-07 19:00:27 Instead of tweeting maybe try doing something helpful for Canadians in the gas and oil industry, or even for the countless veterans that a being denied the services they need. Try that sometime @JustinTrudeau
2540 2018-11-07 19:00:26 Okay, so I don't understand...when did disagreement become attacking? Because to me, attacking would mean censoring. I don't recall Trump ever doing that.

Please give me money!
2542 2018-11-07 19:00:22 If only FGN can double Oil production.
and stop all Tax evading multinationals.

2548 2018-11-07 18:59:32 Totally spot on  green leafy veg, berries, carrot purée/juice taken regularly are fantastic control measures against the free radical risk. Better still; Cannabis Oil (CBD / THC @ 50%)

2550 2018-11-07 18:59:22 Here in Florida they were bundling amendments with a oil drilling ban and threw in an indoor vaping ban with it. Lot of hipsters are going to be upset about that.

2552 2018-11-07 18:59:11 Well I guess I won’t work in yours today. But tomorrow I have some avocado oil I might try
2553 2018-11-07 18:59:03 As per the law of Entropy, S&P at 2800 can be justified only if crude oil is one or two dollars per barrel, meaning business is making large profits from low energy costs, not the meagre 2% yield it has now.
2554 2018-11-07 18:59:03 @CourtneyLeiva saw your rice water article and I noticed the bit about coconut oil. I've read on several occasions that it clogs pores. Do you not find it affecting your skin negatively at all?
2555 2018-11-07 18:58:58 Nope, but one got called, the other didn't. And looch never would have touched Joseph if that first call had been made. Truly i think Oil fans are more angry at refs.

2564 2018-11-07 18:58:32 Make it more prone to tarnish. I learned that from bitter experience. You *might* be able to restore the finish - try buffing it with a cloth with a tiny bit of mineral (baby) oil, and wipe off any excess with tissue. And never boil with baking soda!

2567 2018-11-07 18:58:09 I just got my oil changed and asked them to rotate my tires thinking it would only cost me 5 bucks. They charged me 25 bucks for 5 minutes of work I could have done for free myself
2568 2018-11-07 18:58:04 Africans must trade with other Africans, Nigeria produces Palm oil but kenya buys the oil from Malaysia, Kenya produces flowers but Nigeria buys flowers from the Netherland, This must stop, We need to keep the wealth in Africa

2573 2018-11-07 18:57:46 Funny how @realDonaldTrump thinks the Dems had BIG MONEY & Special Interests, most were grass roots with NO PAC"s unlike the R's who are bought & paid for by the NRA, Big Pharma, Oil, etc...Trumps racist rallies failed! We have the dumbest president!! acting PSYCHO!

2578 2018-11-07 18:57:13 She has her support of oil drilling and the fact that James Smith ran against Henry McMaster to blame more than anything, TBH.
2579 2018-11-07 18:57:13 Or any in-depth reporting on the oil & gas industry?
Do u even know what fracking is? 
U might but I bet most Americans have no idea
Why...because the media is paid by these industries
Which is fine if media fairly reports on them & keeps us informed..but they don't
2580 2018-11-07 18:57:08 You brought up the 5% issue and i have answered that... now we slipped into recession because we were oil driven economy and now we are out of it because we were committed to drive the economy through non oil export... Venezuela for example*

2591 2018-11-07 18:56:24 Was feeling very homesick for my pals so I made @MightyCapacitor's Best Ever Invention for supper - which is basically halloumi, cherry tomatoes and asparagus fried in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, served on a bed of salad, with nice bread.

There ya go.
2597 2018-11-07 18:55:41 This is oil so probably not that simple. Could overshoot to the downside just like it did above $80

What is the Kazakh dictator’s name? You should ask Kazakh oil workers’ families who were shot by his security forces in 2013
2601 2018-11-07 18:55:31 We’d do it all again and this time even better! Everyone knows who @BetoORourke is now. Everyone’s pissed we lost to a snake oil salesman. Totally different dynamic for turnout, especially if Bernie runs

2602 2018-11-07 18:55:23 This is your new life Mr. Trump, get used to it. You told someone early on how surprised you were to find so many people in DC with integrity. You're about to find out what an understatement that was. Too bad, those trillion $ Russian oil contracts could've wet so many beaks.
2603 2018-11-07 18:55:20 Perhaps this easy Money doesn’t apply to the likes of Saudi Arabia, Dubai and host of others who are oil rich nations. Being accountable means you plan for the future. To me it lies in the ability to manage what you have and make sure it’s put to better use for the entire nation.

2616 2018-11-07 18:53:58 What are sum good grapeseed or rosehip seed oil products for oil cleansing?
2617 2018-11-07 18:53:52 So Naive & WRONG! Just ask where the Pulp/Paper, Tire/ Rubber, Steel/Mining, Petrochem, TV/Electronics. & Auto Industries went.  Ag Chem just went out with Monsanto & BP took Half the Oil Industry (ARCO:AMOCO/SOHIOetc)

2624 2018-11-07 18:53:25 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2625 2018-11-07 18:53:21 There is always the slight chance to strike oil, win the lottery or get struck by lightning. So anything is possible. Characters in poverty such as Yusei, Yugo and Shinji own high level cards. The wikia did not have any information on this subject.

2627 2018-11-07 18:53:15 100% agree there is no certainty, but does that mean you don't try?  I'm an old guy, but Oilers/Gretzly and Penguins/Lemieux constantly bitched and it had an effect.  Those last two games were atrocious and you cannot tell me there aren't more league eyeballs when Oil down east.
2628 2018-11-07 18:53:11 honestly so ready to go to my mechanic for an oil change tomorrow and he tells me i need a whole ass new engine or some shit and i have to cancel grayscale
2629 2018-11-07 18:52:57 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their garage door broke and they couldn't get the car out

2633 2018-11-07 18:52:38 It wasn't Scotland's oil. it was UK oil.

Economy growing. 
Yes I really appreciate that you could make oil prices come down, otherwise it was badly impact developing countries. Please work on this further more.
Ways to reduce shootings.
2643 2018-11-07 18:51:02 i got my trucks oil changed way back when i first got it because i did not have the tools, place, or the time to do it myself. I checked the oil 2 hours after completion and he over filled the oil by 5 quarts
2644 2018-11-07 18:50:45 In Colorado, your initiative will lose if you fracture the potential winning coalition before even making the ballot. 

Plan B on fracking should be local control: authorize counties and towns to exercise same land use and zoning authority of oil and gas as all other industries.
2645 2018-11-07 18:50:37 “I don’t want to drive the oil prices up to $100 - $150. “I consider that to be a tax. And I DON T LIKE TAXES.” Donald Trump. Igualito que los políticos españoles.
2646 2018-11-07 18:50:27 I’ve got permanent burn marks on my stomach from when I was cooking tofu and the oil spat at me, surely I’m considered an elite vegan?!
2647 2018-11-07 18:50:24 Hell yeah f the oil industry!
2648 2018-11-07 18:50:09 also, put coconut oil & breastmilk in romans hair after bath time last night. now he stinks 
2649 2018-11-07 18:49:44 Yeah great paints. Only problem I’ve seen is with their top coats not quite covering their undercoats. We found this with the oil and the W/b. Their undercoats are tinted for the final colour but just kept getting some flecks not quite covering. Very annoying.

2652 2018-11-07 18:49:34 I mean heck weapons must be inherently evil because in our culture the most notorious use of it is bombing and shooting things for oil.
2653 2018-11-07 18:49:30 Just wondering that how many barrels of crude oil and how many tonnes of coal were saved in achieving this #landmark?

2660 2018-11-07 18:48:35 An Olympics won't get new pipelines built. It won't bring new head offices to Calgary. It won't fill-up empty downtown office towers. And it won't raise the price of Canadian oil. I'm all for kickstarting Calgary's economy - an Olympics won't do that. #yyccc #justsayno #NOOOOO
2661 2018-11-07 18:48:27 Inflation breakevens continue to move higher in the face of oil weakness
2662 2018-11-07 18:48:18 hi, an esthetician herewhen skin doesn’t get enough water to make a moisture barrier, it produces its own oil to use as a moisture barrier instead. which clogs tf out of your pores. a gentle toner to balance pH as well as upping your hydration should help
2663 2018-11-07 18:48:16 Wow tester nuts won re-election what’s wrong with these people. The only thing they have is oil .

2666 2018-11-07 18:47:43 Now you’re cooking with oil...if you’re gonna play the game at least let it be on all madden vs rookie 
2667 2018-11-07 18:47:39 Domestic stockpiles above ground (no reserves underground of unproduced oil) but inventories accumulated above ground in tanks
2668 2018-11-07 18:47:37  don’t worry I know where you coming from, I’ll never pay anyone to change my oil either
2669 2018-11-07 18:47:22 You look like a bug foo. You twist yo dreads with vegetable oil. You smoke swishers straight out the pack. You use to get bullied at school and you got dreads cause u thought it made you look more intimidating.

2672 2018-11-07 18:46:59 I voted yes on prop 112 even tho my family here is in the oil & gas industry. A part of me felt a little bad but then again I love this planet. Fuck that.
2673 2018-11-07 18:46:47 Is it car trouble month? Took ours in yesterday to change to winter tires (free) and an oil change. $250 later...
2674 2018-11-07 18:46:45 it would be one of the worst pains I’ve ever felt but it would be worth it

2685 2018-11-07 18:45:29 Edo State: Kerosene now sell for N270 / 300 per litre. Now beyond the financial muscles of the poor. This is an oil producing country where the mineral is not suppose to exceed N10 per litre #wonder4ulworld

2689 2018-11-07 18:45:21 Now these, I remember! With cotton wool soaked in mustard oil!
2690 2018-11-07 18:45:15 Yes I do respect them: they could all have left to Russia!
#crimeaisukraine 
It had NOTHING to do with that.
Putin needed to invade to control, oil, fibre optics insertion & Sevastopol.
Now Putin invades E. Ukraine to control manufacturing/mining & build a land bridge to Crimea
2691 2018-11-07 18:45:05 Ingredient Watch: Eating mayonnaise this November? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!

2696 2018-11-07 18:44:13 In case of Iran, the unwise move of exemption provides Ayatollahs the opportunity to flood global markets with  oil @ discounted cash using India & Afghanistan as conduits - sub-selling & profiting on the spoils of US-Iran trade sanctions. This booty funds regional hostilities
2697 2018-11-07 18:43:58 To slow climate change, we need to stop dark money from the oil and gas industry.
2698 2018-11-07 18:43:57 I finally figured out why all the Trumps seem to have a light sheen of grease oozing out of them at all times. That's the evil. Never realized it before, but evil comes out in oil form. Just look at Putin. Hitler seemed to have it too.
2699 2018-11-07 18:43:51 You guys talk about how Nigerians are living below some certain amount per day... if not until now that we are venturing into other non oil export. In case you forgot... Nigeria was an oil based economy prior to now
2700 2018-11-07 18:43:51 Hmm GOOG, FB, AAPL, AMZN and we're not competitive?  That's right, we should bring back coal, steel, and double down on multi-billion $ oil pipelines!
2701 2018-11-07 18:43:44 I spilled my BodyLove by Tal & I just got it last week. I'm super tight. Now I'm mad my bathroom smell like Lavender because that's oil that I can't put on my face now 
2702 2018-11-07 18:43:43 Someone told me I smell great and that is just my favorite compliment  my hair smells like Moroccan oil and lilac. My lotion smells like lavender and my perfume smells like roses. I’m a walking flower bouquet hehe
2703 2018-11-07 18:43:41 You know we gotta hand it to these Journalists who stand up to oppression and corruption using nothing but questions and reasoning. Those guys are patriots.

2755 2018-11-07 18:39:17 “Y’all ready for this? You can fry chicken with my face oil.”
2756 2018-11-07 18:39:14 Hahahah that was completely different  

The oil boom dried up AND that was still the Midwest hahahaha
2757 2018-11-07 18:39:00 People will seriously argue about anything these days, I no shit just seen a full argument about oil changes.
2758 2018-11-07 18:38:59 Imagining growing up in the Mediterranean where I'd get a mid day nap and then snack on olive oil and wine all day rather than growing up in Ireland where I stepped in a puddle this morning and have had a wet sock in my shoe all day

2763 2018-11-07 18:38:38 Well said! Increase the oil/transportation and heat costs for everything everybody it's not economic smart! Accomplish nothing in environmental aspects! Just diminish consumer power !
2764 2018-11-07 18:38:38 I think most Americans are switched on when it comes to what's actually out there. 
However, in the wider world when disclosure does come out, it's gong to cause so much chaos.
Free energy
Technology 
Religion
Oil Cartels 
Pharmaceuticals
Banking
It's a huge problem.
2765 2018-11-07 18:38:31 Yep, I was at dealership over 7 hours nickel and diming.  They offered another lower price and 7 year bumper to bumper and instead of only 2 free oil changes I got 3 years worth.  I dont play with dealerships nor care about their bottom line.  No good deal I walk.
2766 2018-11-07 18:38:30 Although oil prices remain around $ 70, this is only due to adventurism played during last two yrs. If PMLN was allowed to work freely, the situation today is much better and we have more stable and prosperous PAK. Very unfortunate and don’t understand why it was done
2767 2018-11-07 18:38:18 I’m having difficulty wiping the big oil’ grin off my face. “Chairwoman Maxine Waters” 
2768 2018-11-07 18:38:16 We might as well get a Benz paying $100 dollars for a oil change  the maintenance on a Benz really be the only thing ppl scared of because they have affordable ones
2769 2018-11-07 18:38:06 Also I only got a total of 7 fleas off both cats! YAY! I guess the tea tree oil down their backs did the trick. Take that you dumb bugs 
2770 2018-11-07 18:38:00 I’m mad that @Trey_McGarity is making the money he is in the oil field and barely got me to go work with him.. this nigga making that stupid money and didn’t tell nobody 
2771 2018-11-07 18:37:51 The ReTHUGlieCONS screwed the pooch on this one. Just WTH has he done for Texas, for women? Zip. It’s all the Koch brothers, SuperPACS, Big Oil, Big Pharma and special interests. How is he worth $5M on $179,000 a year? And his wife moans they can’t afford a second house? WTF?

2775 2018-11-07 18:37:10 States, as they are defined now often, have little roots to what they were founded on. Northern CA is now a tech hub when it used to be an Gold Rush zone. Indiana now does pharma (lily) even though it was "The crossroads of America" Was ND supposed to be an Oil shale boomstate?
2776 2018-11-07 18:37:05 If u have followed American politics for sometime then u know that previous administrations have all run up excessive debt.The difference with this administration is that the President is getting our allies to pay their fair share,  renegotiating trade, and now exporting U.S. oil
2777 2018-11-07 18:36:51 Im gonna learn how to change my own damn oil
2778 2018-11-07 18:36:50 At some point you’re going to start campaigning to the 17 out of 20 Albertans that don’t work in the oil and gas industry and tell us how you’re going to balance Alberta’s books without turning us into a crappy red state now that the last oil boom is behind us, right Jason?
2779 2018-11-07 18:36:49 Graeme with your love for the Union I guess you must be absolutely gutted to learn that Norway extracting less oil has accumulated £1trn fund.  But not that you or anyone else would have known about as Thatcher lied and suppressed the info for 30 years.  Better Together?
2780 2018-11-07 18:36:46 Think related to wealthy class in those states. TX oil, MD research, and ranchers, FL service, tourism, real estate.
2781 2018-11-07 18:36:09 due to comments about oil in press conference..? Trump
2782 2018-11-07 18:36:01 Just to note, we import a lot of oil and gas that supply power stations and also mechanical systems. 
No oil means no power and no sanitation. Clean water goes.
This has been in government resilience planning for decades.

2795 2018-11-07 18:34:41 Well I’m pretty sure if we didn’t do it that way the states would have never united. Each state wants diff things. Some oil. Some auto some tech. And so on. It’s good that they all have a say. It will never change so I wouldn’t stress on it
2796 2018-11-07 18:34:41 On my way to give my ‘95  an oil change. He definitely needs it.
2797 2018-11-07 18:34:41 Lavender oil has been my Bestfriend lately. I can’t go a day without it. Sleeping is soooo much more lit now.
2798 2018-11-07 18:34:38 Just a little baby oil and he would have had it. To bad.
2799 2018-11-07 18:34:36 I highly doubt the American govt will try to finance a decade of coup and assassination attempts against New York, as well as economic isolation meant to destabilize it.

After all, they have no oil.
2800 2018-11-07 18:34:34 Arabs are very Lucky, God gave them religion, oil money, good skin and preety faces. I don't know what was our forefathers' sins.
2801 2018-11-07 18:34:34 If this SPV is just another fancy name for food/medicine in exchange for oil with no hard currency pouring into mullahs coffee, then how is Iranian regime to finance its agents in #Lebanon #Yemen, ballistic missiles program, proxy wars in #Syria etc.?
2802 2018-11-07 18:34:32 And why did the POTUS lie again about oil going down, 
Price of oil in Jan 2017:  $53
Price now:   $63
Another lie by the POTUS!
Why don't you ask him in your little talks why he feels he has to lie?

2810 2018-11-07 18:33:50 Lamb,  Broccolini, and  Soy Sauce!

  1/4  lb of  Lamb,  Ground 
  1 1/3  cup of  Broccolini,  Diced 
  2  tsp of  Soy Sauce 

 Marinate  Lamb in 1/3 cup Olive Oil and  Soy Sauce for 1 hour. 
 Boil the  Broccolini for 15 minutes. 
 Top with salt and  Soy Sauce. 

 Don't burn it!
2811 2018-11-07 18:33:34 I just use olive oil and salt & pepper though but I bet cheesy ones are ace
2812 2018-11-07 18:33:28 I use only natural/cruelty free/vegan products! currently using this turmeric based face wash and mist, already clearing up my skin so much! I also bought witch hazel off amazon... stoked to try it! I love tea tree oil as well 
2813 2018-11-07 18:33:21 So if oil is the grape they are after, why not go for Angola, Kenya, or other African countries that have proven oil reserves? The article might have some facts, but it's still biased.
2814 2018-11-07 18:33:20 Striking a balance, yes. And sometimes the push for social Democracy goes too far. Take at look at the history of Sweden during the 1970s thru 1990s. They learned their lesson and backed away from it, but apparently they're forgetting again. 
Norway doesn't count. Awash w/ oil $$
2815 2018-11-07 18:33:19 Onions, garlic, and olive oil sautéd in a pan makes literally anything you put in afterwards taste amazing

2821 2018-11-07 18:32:23 @realDonaldTrump  you have done FUCK ALL for oil prices!! You're mostly the cause for these prices because the OPEC countries hate your guts and would like nothing better than to make you sit in your stool!! Why are you such a whiney bitch??
2822 2018-11-07 18:32:20 H ha ha> No worry. Lebanon doesn't produce a single gallon of oil. May be in a few years when they start experimental production.
2823 2018-11-07 18:32:09 We laughed so hard when 45 picked Sessions I mean we don't have a lottery, took years to get the use of cbd oil alone for medical use. A Alabama politician is never going forward on nothing except keeping shit old and white..

2844 2018-11-07 18:29:54 I like the info he provided TBH. Even if it was probably another attempt to down play $LG.V

Kinda proves that the most viable way of mass producing CBD oil for use across the #MMJ industry will be via low cost large scale Southern hemisphere growing.

2846 2018-11-07 18:29:50 Erdogan begs Trump to void Halkbank penalties for violating Iran sanctions.

The more you give Erdogan the more he bites your hand....
2847 2018-11-07 18:29:50 Robert you must feel absolutely terrific that Thatcher lied about Scotland's Oil for 30 years and suppressed the info that would have given Scotland £1trn but I guess you could not care less about your fellow disadvantaged Scots.  That's just the type of guy you are
2848 2018-11-07 18:29:46 Yes processed meat which contains nitrates is the real damage to the body, fried food and overcooked meat. People think olive oil is healthy for cooking, but think again, it causes oxidative damage - free radicals causes inflammation..

2859 2018-11-07 18:28:15 Thank you John, you ran an honest campaign and one that listened and spoke to all Californians without the need to preach “change” while lying in a bed of hypocrisy and inaction.  Unfortunately, there are many in this state who only hear the voices of snake oil salesmen.
2860 2018-11-07 18:28:13 That's the ONLY thing stopping me from putting my house on the market. #RedTideRick in the Senate? I see a future with red tide on both coasts & oil drilling in the gulf. He's a corrupt liar, but will fit right in with the rest of the @GOP up there.

2862 2018-11-07 18:27:53 Just because your neighbors are Cruz-loving dupes doesn't mean everyone in TX who supported Beto is a "coastal elite." Some of us are tired of having ALEC, the NRA and oil lobbyists running the place.
2863 2018-11-07 18:27:53 Rosehip oil (especially cold-pressed) works well, with consistent use.
2864 2018-11-07 18:27:51 They are uneducated & uninformed sheep that will blindly follow any snake oil salesman. Democrats must stop being idealistic & adopt a realistic approach in choosing both a Presidential & VP candidate to run against & beat Trump.

2868 2018-11-07 18:27:33 @gzchef I’m confused re instructions that came w/nonstick cast iron pan. It says always preheat w/oil, butter, or water. Never heat w/a dry surface. On QVC you said nothing was needed in the pan. The eggs, steak, and salmon all went into preheated, dry pans.
2869 2018-11-07 18:27:32 Trudeau is sending representatives to COP24 in December because he's busy at home, facilitating the destruction of the petroleum industry and encouraging Canadian and foreign oil firms to export capital and skilled employees to the US.

2872 2018-11-07 18:27:10 Please help us in California, taxes are aweful and gas prices over 4.00 
You say we arr producing more oil than anyone yet it's still four dollars a gallon.  Taxes are so high , I can't afford to move out or I would.  Please help California
2873 2018-11-07 18:27:08 why don't we build a refinery on the oil sands and ship the fuels Canadians need - have good jobs  and keep the  mess all in one spot ?
2874 2018-11-07 18:27:02 So tell me where we can get A GOOD JOB at the ages of 15-17, sorry we can’t go get an oil field job. Most of us go to school (8 hrs) straight to work . Idc what anyone says, us kids who work & go to school deserve more bc at least we’re actually trying to work.
2875 2018-11-07 18:26:57 Why you they answer am, I don give am the best answer na, let him go join them, volunteer himself too.
2876 2018-11-07 18:26:55 All in the name of Big Oil! It is very sad that we cannot get away from it.

2878 2018-11-07 18:26:43 I’ve been waiting almost 2 hours to get this oil change. If it wasn’t for me getting a lifetime engine warranty I’d be doing it myself
2879 2018-11-07 18:26:35 Oil prices ONLY go DOWN  in a weak economy. So which is it? Do we have the greatest economy ever or is it slowing down? He can't have it both ways.

2881 2018-11-07 18:26:26 A nigga just knocked on my door asking for cooking oil...just when I thought I made it out 
2882 2018-11-07 18:26:25 2017 and I’m the first owner, it’s been on before and I took it in and they said it was fine, and I took it in for an oil change at the dealer and they go through a big check list so I imagine it’s fine but I’ll take it in anyways
2883 2018-11-07 18:26:12 Crushing grapes gives flavor to wine. Crushing olives gives us oil. The situations of life that you think are crushing you are actually yielding God’s flavor and oil in your life.
2884 2018-11-07 18:25:56 Isn't it good to be British especially when you are Scottish when we could have had £1trn in the Bank just like Norway with less Oil extracted.  You must feel absolutely terrific that being in bed with Unionists has denied your fellow Scots a chance of a better life.
2885 2018-11-07 18:25:48 Tis indeed.

Was also fucked off when the egotistical L Armstrong cheated to the top after years of denial but that was obvious to anyone with an IQ over 50 too.

City could of pissed this without having the need to inflate its sponsorship deals but that's how the oil lads work.
2886 2018-11-07 18:25:37 @realDonaldTrump the dear leader just told me that the oil prices are down because of him, even though my own eyes have been telling otherwise.  im sure he is telling THE TRUTH,  and the high prices they charge me at the pump must be a Soros globalist conspiracy!!!

2888 2018-11-07 18:25:34 Ongoing White House press conference. On Q abt Pres Erdogan statement that Turkey won’t abide by Iran sanctions, Pres Trump: it’s primarily to keep oil prices down that some countries are given a waiver. On Khasshoggi incident: “I am forming a very strong opinion.”
2889 2018-11-07 18:25:29 Kinda what I thought.. Was thinking of upgrading my 2010 to a 2019 for some of the newer bells & whistles such as the 360 camera and the sorts. I mean it isnt necceasary, but helps. Then again I don't even know how to change my own oil xd..  I'm a computer tech not a mechanic xD
2890 2018-11-07 18:25:16 Trump just said that the price of crude oil is down due to him. 
"down is up, and up is down"

Energy Information Administration's estimate that gas will cost an average of $2.79 a gallon in 2018, up 37 cents from last year's average.
2891 2018-11-07 18:25:15 Ah think if you hit him on the side of the head with a punch the sound would be similar tae hittin an empty oil drum wae a sledgehammer.......... Doioioioinnggggggg space napper
2892 2018-11-07 18:25:12 #Trump claims that because of him for the last 5 months the price of oil has come down, but the cost at the pump has been rising so I think there's a discrepancy there.

2902 2018-11-07 18:24:23 HAHAHAHA!!! Tax returns, money laundering, and indictments..... grab your popcorn folks, it is going to be a bumpy ride. The snake oil salesman, who has conned half of America, is about to have his tab come due. This while the Pres melts down at a press conference haha.
2903 2018-11-07 18:24:06 Haven't you learned yet? They couldn't care less! They want you to do their dirty work and bomb, kill and invade oil rich Muslim countries whilst they live lavish lives. If they cared so much, why aren't they on the front line?

2913 2018-11-07 18:23:02 Decentralization is what this is called. The same method will work for the downstream oil sector(refineries) & literally almost every other sector. But rara o... We choose to be 'reversing back' 
2914 2018-11-07 18:23:00 Sure. My cats will get fur balls especially around the change of seasons when the temperature changes and they are shorthairs. The fish oil lubricates the hair ball making it easier to throw up or pass. You can give them 3-4 capsules worth for a few days (2-3) and then drop...
2915 2018-11-07 18:22:53 Oh man, @realDonaldTrump is kicking -ss all over the media biased faces. Listening to him now as as he explains to a room of IDIOTS &has to dumb down to explain to them how oil prices and market mechanics work how he is #MAGA!!

2950 2018-11-07 18:20:29 Trump said he doesn’t want oil close to 100 dollars he just torpedo shorts on oil lol
2951 2018-11-07 18:20:28 President Trump just said in his press conference at the White House: oil prices are coming down, because of me !!! In fact oil prices did not surge, because he retreated from his previous position to zero Iran's oil exports.
2952 2018-11-07 18:20:26 .@realDonaldTrump on sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports--and the waivers granted to 8 nations: "They’ll get tougher as time goes by. Maybe. But I don’t want to raise oil prices..."
2953 2018-11-07 18:20:23 I just briefly watched a minute of it, when a journalist from Lebanon, asked him a question, re: oil - trump was very disrespectful, referring to his accent; I shut off the TV!
2954 2018-11-07 18:20:14 But this definition of what resources are is just flat out wrong.  The oil was in the ground for centuries. It wasn't a resource until someone figure out how to extract it and use it.  There are no "natural" resources. Except sun and rain and soil. Natural resources aren't enough

He hopes to have a working relationship w/the Dem House, but if they try to impreach, he'll do...

I lost my car in May 2018 and gas prices at the pump are EXACTLY the same now as they were those 6 (several) months ago.  So how is your statement before the Press Corp true?

2973 2018-11-07 18:18:46 I understand the tech focus, but headline should have mentioned that oil companies spent twice the amount as proponents of I-1631. 
The article does provide the complete picture, but many people may not look beyond the headline.
2974 2018-11-07 18:18:44 @realDonaldTrump We are the #2 oil producer today.  But that is not enough.  We need to develop more shale oil fields to move to Number #1 and to start exporting oil products

2989 2018-11-07 18:17:59 Why not? This guarantees that Imperial will have a good supply of $18 oil to pass through to parent company Mobile, who will then be able to sell it for $78.
2990 2018-11-07 18:17:57 there is a large supply of oil Nobody knows where it is coming from
2991 2018-11-07 18:17:54 Schiff is done, buy gold buy gold. Meanwhile in reality, gold hasn't gone anywhere. The Dow never entered a correction and has gained back almost everything it lost in October. Crude oil is down again. What happened to the big crash? The collapse of the dollar?
2992 2018-11-07 18:17:50 Trump asserting he is responsible for oil prices going down, but they’ve gone up since his election significantly. $56.19 in 12/16 to $69.23 as of 10/19/18 that’s a 13% increase.

2996 2018-11-07 18:17:28 Trump says he is the one driving oil prices down "It's me"... we might be nearing a tradable bottom
2997 2018-11-07 18:17:28 Trump manipulated gas prices till after the election.  They actually sanctioned an Iranian oil tanker that actually sank and is no longer viable.  Gas prices are going up people.  Saudia Arabia is taking all the Asia money   #Whitehouse
2998 2018-11-07 18:17:27 They will Implement this when all the oil has run out and they can make a profit from it.
2999 2018-11-07 18:17:25 Yeah, nail on the head there. Also - It’ll be interesting to see if/what gains RBR make with Honda and if/how Renault will manage to improve having to deliver to fewer customers (and not factor in e.g. differing oil suppliers) and with two experienced drivers (Daniel and Nico)

OPEC and the GCC are NOT price setters for crude oil.  
Too many alternative suppliers are out there.  
The only things they can do is to either pump more oil, or pump less oil.  
Market forces set prices.  
Things are not like they where 40 years ago.

3010 2018-11-07 18:16:52 The price of crude oil pb is $61.93 today
Thought you might want to know
I'd hate to see the price of.oil go up to $100-150 pb
Sure you would
3011 2018-11-07 18:16:48 Trump just claimed he's lowering Oil Prices.

2016: $40.68 per barrel

2018: $70.28 per barrel
3012 2018-11-07 18:16:42 I guess if you shorted oil you lose lol

3014 2018-11-07 18:16:30 Just any old fish oil?
3015 2018-11-07 18:16:28 Trump says he won't stop Iran selling oil to countries like Turkey because he does "not want to drive up the oil price" - so his sanctions are not quite as tough as he has said
#OOTT
3016 2018-11-07 18:16:21 Trump says he gave oil waivers to the Iran sanctions because he does not want oil prices to go up because that would be a "tax."
3017 2018-11-07 18:16:20 Trump does not want Americans to pay higher oil prices as he considers that a tax, but he is not concerned about Americans paying tariffs or higher prices for consumer goods to avoid paying tariffs, as for some reason he does not consider that to be a tax!
3018 2018-11-07 18:16:19 oLIVE OIL !!!!
3019 2018-11-07 18:16:19 "Data is the new oil"
3020 2018-11-07 18:16:15 Try using skin oil right out of the shower and then moisturize with a god body lotion (CeraVe, Nivea etc whatever you like) the oil will make your skin absorb the moisture better by softening it
3021 2018-11-07 18:16:14 @realDonaldTrump  claims he knows about oil markets..but can't open an umbrella. I bet he has no clue how to change the oil in a car...
3022 2018-11-07 18:16:10 Trump says he made the "absolute right decision" to grant temporary waivers on the Iran sanctions. He says he didn't want to drive up oil prices
3023 2018-11-07 18:16:06 If I break your heart na oil spillage

3024 2018-11-07 18:16:00 When the oil resides in one's country, then, yes, you get to be a monopoly.
3025 2018-11-07 18:15:57 Trump q&a: Oil a "very fragile" market, "don't like" OPEC cartel. Have been able to keep oil prices going lower. @trump @elections @federalreserve @anthonymace10
3026 2018-11-07 18:15:55 .@realDonaldTrump on Iran sanctions and exemptions, "It's a very fragile (oil) market," said he doesn't want prices to go to $100 or $150
3027 2018-11-07 18:15:50 Interesting that #Trump has toned it down re #oil embargo and desire to crack down on it furthur. Seems to indicate that he may consider renewing waivers rather than them being a one-time thing.
3028 2018-11-07 18:15:50 #Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine. Peter Sondergaard,
3029 2018-11-07 18:15:45 @BBCTwo's House of Saud documentary series is chilling, there is unfathomable corruption and oppression in Saudi Arabia and our government is culpable . All to get that sweet sweet oil. Disgusting. #HouseofSaud #SaudiArabia
3030 2018-11-07 18:15:36 Reporter: "President Erdoğan says he will continue to purchase oil...
Trump: "Who said that?"
Reporter: "President Erdoğan..."
Trump: Tilts head...
Reporter: "President Erdoğan  of Turkey..."

WOW...
3031 2018-11-07 18:15:35 You idiots actually believe The great State of Texas (my home ) would ever help to elect a person like Beto, hahahaNOT THIS STATE!!! KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT OF THIS STATE, oil production is booming, Texas has had the largest number of jobs increased in last two years,
3032 2018-11-07 18:15:34 So, oil prices are coming down but gas is going up?
3033 2018-11-07 18:15:33 Trump says the recent drop in the oil price was because of him and he knows the market "very well." He doesn't want it to reach $100 again, he says #OOTT
3034 2018-11-07 18:15:31 I view an RPS as proven, popular, second best energy subsidy. 

Much harder are (1) first-best externality pricing (esp of the revenue neutral variety) or (2) third-best zoning as a way to ban oil and gas extraction.
3035 2018-11-07 18:15:31 forgot to mention, some garlic olive oil to spice the pan up and some red pepper midway through. it just gets better over time, like me
3036 2018-11-07 18:15:30 Meanwhile, Trump is saying he's trying to drive down oil prices, to target OPEC, because he considers high oil prices a tax on consumers. 

Not great news for Canada.
3037 2018-11-07 18:15:29 Trump basically just acknowledged suppressing oil prices is more important than squeezing Iran.
3038 2018-11-07 18:15:26 Did he jus pronounce OIL, "EARL"?!?!
3039 2018-11-07 18:15:21 Trump on oil waivers from #IranSanctions to 8 countries: I did it because I don't want oil prices to spike to $100 per barrel.
3040 2018-11-07 18:15:21 Trump just now
"Oil prices have come down because of ME."
OPEC and the market had nothing to do with that?
Sociopathic idiot.
3041 2018-11-07 18:15:19 Very possibly a hairball. I give mine fish oil (just open a capsule and squeeze the contents in a bowl). Try three or four over a day. She may not throw it up but rather pass it through. It may take a couple of days. If this works try giving her a capsule daily but only one.
3042 2018-11-07 18:15:15 Trump says he "gave some countries a break" on oil sanctions "because they asked for some help" and because he didn't want to drive up oil prices
3043 2018-11-07 18:15:14 Now Trump says HE CONTROLS the oil prices... 

#NOTMYPRESIDENT #PRESIDENTMORON #AMERICANIDIOT #USA
3044 2018-11-07 18:15:14 The only reason I’m watching Trump’s dumb ass right now is because I’m getting an oil change and they have it on the TV.
3045 2018-11-07 18:15:12 Oil prices in CA at a near high. Of course CA is going to vote against Trump's actions just because!!!
3046 2018-11-07 18:15:12 oil and water 
3047 2018-11-07 18:15:11 Trump says he gave countries a waiver on oil because he wants oil prices to come down.
3048 2018-11-07 18:15:10 You @realDonaldTrump @POTUS know nothing about the oil & gas industry!!!!  NOTHING.
3049 2018-11-07 18:15:10 Gas prices and oil is up..what the hell is he talking about
3050 2018-11-07 18:15:08 Uh, so why are gas prices continuing to rise?? Trump just said he's responsible for oil prices coming down??
3051 2018-11-07 18:15:06 Amazing that @realDonaldTrump says he won't stop Iran selling oil to countries like Turkey because he does "not want to drive up the oil price" - so his sanctions are not quite as tough as he has said
3052 2018-11-07 18:15:04 Evening I tried too report a problem this morning on your website it took a hour major oil spill and was causing chaos could you possibly look into this
3053 2018-11-07 18:15:01 Bush #closetdemocrat sold out our country, started a war over oil when he knew the weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed. #murderer of our soldiers!
3054 2018-11-07 18:15:00 He is bloody incredible. Asked about using racist language he fluffed it out. He says black pastors are on his cell phone. Talk about oil price  they are decreasing. Lies. Lies and more lies.
Asked about faulty voting machines. He knows nothing about that.
3055 2018-11-07 18:14:59 Manje oil ichabuda 
3056 2018-11-07 18:14:58 Just hearing Donald Trump, apparently oil prices been coming down because of him. Im in trouble.
3057 2018-11-07 18:14:58 @realDonaldTrump oil prices are not going down here! The low cost from years ago is from fracking NOT you!
3058 2018-11-07 18:14:57 Les USA c'est tesla or oil, apple or asia etc..

3060 2018-11-07 18:14:51 US President Donald Trump right now: the oil price has come down because of me!
3061 2018-11-07 18:14:45 Gas prices are going up while Trump claims he is responsible for lower oil prices.
3062 2018-11-07 18:14:44 Siguen convocando a Gruezo el ha tenido muchas oportunidades nada en la selección... Debe tener buenos padrinos...
3063 2018-11-07 18:14:43 Trump tries to claim he brought down oil prices. Why stop there, maybe you brought back Jesus from the dead.
3064 2018-11-07 18:14:39 Thank you President Trumpfor reducing the price of oil all by yourself. You self deluding lunatic.
3065 2018-11-07 18:14:38 Big oil and corporations brainwashed, manipulated and confused the fuck out of Washington State voters. Sad day.
3066 2018-11-07 18:14:34 Trump - "I am driving oil prices down" Oil prices are going down because of ME"
explaining why he gave waivers to countries re Iranian oil sanctions.
@chigrl
3067 2018-11-07 18:14:34 Saudi Arabia has 20% of the world's oil reserves, second in the world. It also has the sixth-largest natural gas reserves and large amounts of timber. Overall, the country has about $34.4 trillion worth of natural resources. Saudi Arabia is a small country, the size of Alaska.
3068 2018-11-07 18:14:32 You just heard it! He took credit for lower oil prices so he will have to accept blame when they go up! #WeWontForget #PressConference
3069 2018-11-07 18:14:30 Trump q&a: Have never used racist remarks despite accusations. Re oil, re-imposed sanctions on Iran but granted exemptions for some countries so not to hike oil prices but sanctions will maybe get tougher as time goes by. @trump @federalreserve @elections @anthonymace10

3073 2018-11-07 18:14:28 But they got the guns and they got the oil and they freed Europe to this horrible price!
3074 2018-11-07 18:14:27 Trump says that "oil prices are coming down". Aha! Thanks to him they are growing in Germany.
3075 2018-11-07 18:14:27 "Oil prices have come down because of me," says the orange-faced con man.  Remember this when prices come up.  #trainwreck
3076 2018-11-07 18:14:27 Trump says in recently months oil prices "have gone significantly down. That's because of me."
3077 2018-11-07 18:14:27 Also 2 wrongs don’t make a right we are not 10 years old anymore :P
3078 2018-11-07 18:14:23 .@POTUS on #IranSanctions - says he gave some countries a break on importing oil, because he does not want to drive oil prices up to $100 a barrel.

3084 2018-11-07 18:14:03 @realDonaldTrump , I pay for oil, and I’ve paid MORE in the last year alone. you liar!
3085 2018-11-07 18:14:02 Dear Trump: Oil. Prices. Are. Not. Coming. Down.
#PressConference
3086 2018-11-07 18:14:02 Never say 100-150 oil prices.   That is bad mojo for any market.
3087 2018-11-07 18:14:00 Trump: Oil prices are coming down. That's because of me.

But when they go back up, will he still take credit?
3088 2018-11-07 18:13:59 Um... oil prices are coming down?
3089 2018-11-07 18:13:57 Trump takes credit for driving oil prices down #OOTT
3090 2018-11-07 18:13:55 He took the words out of my mouth.   Price of oil.
3091 2018-11-07 18:13:55 A monopoly called OPEC? Have you looked at US oil output recently, Mr. President?
3092 2018-11-07 18:13:54 "oil price came down because of me" @realDonaldTrump words of a good man
3093 2018-11-07 18:13:53 “You have a monopoly called OPEC... and I don’t like it...”

“I don’t want to drive the oil prices up to $100 - $150...

“I consider that to be a tax. And I don’t like taxes.” — Trump
3094 2018-11-07 18:13:53 Oil prices are coming down.....LOL. I travel for a living, in a care, have you bought gas lately.
3095 2018-11-07 18:13:53 Err, Trumpelstiltskin, you have zilch effect on bringing oil prices down.
3096 2018-11-07 18:13:51 donnie says oil prices are down under him.  I guess he's never been to a gas station.
3097 2018-11-07 18:13:51 Trump: Oil prices have come down very substantially over the past couple of months. 

Huh? Eh?
3098 2018-11-07 18:13:50 FYI I pay more for gas than I did 2 years ago. How exactly are oil prices going down?
3099 2018-11-07 18:13:50 Why don't we build wind farms and tidal energy . Instead of pipelines. I think it is because the west coast are conservatives.  We dont have much oil but have alot of wind and strong tides so which makes sense
3100 2018-11-07 18:13:49 Trump is now an expert in the oil market lmao $USO $OIL
3101 2018-11-07 18:13:48 .@realDonaldTrump oil prices have not gone down. Not at all.
3102 2018-11-07 18:13:44 What did the President do to "drop oil prices significantly"? I'm still paying $2.90
3103 2018-11-07 18:13:42 Now Trump says Oil Prices are coming down, but Gas Prices in Arizona are up 70 cents a Gallon for us!
3104 2018-11-07 18:13:40 Trump says he wants oil prices down #OOTT
3105 2018-11-07 18:13:40 it wouldn't be *that* hard for him to do exactly what he already does, but then name problems (oil firms, the fossil fuel lobby, capitalism itself, whatever) that aren't simply our own consumption habits. It's ok to like DA but want more from his huge platform
3106 2018-11-07 18:13:36 Have oil prices gone down?
3107 2018-11-07 18:13:36 well.... we can't set him on fire or burn him in oil.... I got nothen other then tuning him out!

3118 2018-11-07 18:13:15 As well as a moisturizer. For my hyaluronic acid I use Klairs Supple Skin Prep Unscented, which lasts me a long time. I use a rosewater spray (even plain water will do, you just need some water to make the acid “work”) and neutrogena hydroboost (extra dry) as well as jojoba oil
3119 2018-11-07 18:13:15 @realDonaldTrump Oil prices still do not change that we have to get off of burning fossil fuels.
3120 2018-11-07 18:13:11 Chillllll, I took her to get an oil change and everything. 
3121 2018-11-07 18:13:10 Oil prices are coming down because of ME. And OPEC is a monopoly he claims.
3122 2018-11-07 18:13:09 That’s why you do deep conditionings and oil treatments 
You should be doing them once or twice a week
3123 2018-11-07 18:13:06 You can't uncouple the Legacy Auto industry from the Oil Industry. They have a symbiotic relationship. Oil benefits from ICE are obvious. The Auto benefits from Oil are more subtle. Using ICE guarantees steady stream of parts and service income that BEV does not.

3140 2018-11-07 18:10:53 I will never forget getting in a Twitter debate with this dufus. His premise was that the US looting Syria's oil and using it for ourselves is morally correct and isn't theft because Assad is bad.
3141 2018-11-07 18:10:49 So Oil and gas bought off the majority of your party including Polis?

By the way, if you want to win in Colorado probably not a great idea to have a guy in a Raiders cap front and center on your website.
3142 2018-11-07 18:10:46 Notwithstanding the fact that few of your caucus would withstand a forensic audit, what makes you think your individual data will be worth sifting through hundreds of thousands of records to examine? Unstripped data in such large amounts is useless to statisticians.

3147 2018-11-07 18:10:22 when will you start caring about the 14m UK people living in poverty, and stop demanding huge amounts of extra cash for the likes of Theresa May and women living in 6-bedroom parsonages with their oil Executive husbands?

3149 2018-11-07 18:10:09 Also, America's senseless forever wars should be protested as the human toll is atrocious and we now wage war for oil and the military industrial complex. It has nothing to do with freedom, liberty, or democracy.
3150 2018-11-07 18:10:02 I'm no economist, but isn't it the most logical scenario - oil is no longer a monopoly, & there are other energy options. The moment it gets up around 80 new supply kicks in & it sinks back. $50-80. Don't wait for the $120 folks, this is what we have to work with. It's enough.
3151 2018-11-07 18:09:59 Soup fail two days in a row! The first was garden vegetable yesterday that was swimming with oil and tasted greasy and gritting.  Today my egg drop soup is gummy and flavorless and goopy.  What's sick girl on Keto supposed to do? :(
3152 2018-11-07 18:09:48 Young Living is the best essential oil company out there. We have true 100% pure essential oils. If you want more info, feel free to DM me.

3154 2018-11-07 18:09:28 Nate, you were changing your forecasts every minute yesterday.
You even called the House for GOP one time. This is ridiculous, pure snake oil.
3155 2018-11-07 18:09:22 It's exhausting isn't it? I'm a single parent and do EVERYTHING but it's not that much different to when I was in a relationship really. The things which oil everyday life (everything you mentioned) automatically fall to us without any acknowledgement or appreciation

3158 2018-11-07 18:08:54 Oil isn’t coming back and has nothing to do with NDP. That’s going to be the big wake up call for Albertans.

3163 2018-11-07 18:08:27 Did you add cabbage? Carrot? Sardines or crayfish  is it not just palm oil,maggi,salt and plantain, please what else did you add?
3164 2018-11-07 18:08:20 It's amazing how this oil money team can't stop poking fun at others.
3165 2018-11-07 18:08:15 More paranoia from the party that fought to avoid releasing hundred-year-old census data because it might expose the truth about their ancestors' social position.
3166 2018-11-07 18:08:00 Same climate change denier Donald Trump that ripped up the Paris accord, backs coal and oil lobbies and stripped the Environmental Protection Agency of its budget and powers?

3180 2018-11-07 18:06:38 You are ghouls pushing people towards ill health, emotional and psychological problems and early death. How is this snake oil legal ? You sleep ok working here or is soullessness just part of the job requirements ?

3187 2018-11-07 18:05:33 Yes, but they now also own the assets (planted oil palm trees, equipment, physical structures, etc.) recovered from the company. This type of recovery is a first and presents a new and different kind of business opportunity.

3192 2018-11-07 18:05:05 Taxes makes sense when we talk about ressources like iron or oil. If you own a iron mine, you should pay taxes, because no one can claim that the iron in the earth is their property. In this case, property is theft and taxes are reasonable

3201 2018-11-07 18:04:09 We need to question the make up of the gov't when the needs of the oil drilling, chemical spilling, coal mining, water polluters across the plains and mid west come in above the needs of clean air, clean water, keeping NYC, LA and FL above water that benefit everyone.

3212 2018-11-07 18:02:56 So no one talked about his 'hope'n'change'- they talked about the pipes and the bankruptcy. Houston has refineries, oil transport and oil millionaires. They know pipes, and power and balanced books. It was all very hard-headed. Nobody quoted his gauzy speeches.
3213 2018-11-07 18:02:45 Question? Do you change the oil in your daily driver or do you have it done?  ME, I change my oil.
3214 2018-11-07 18:02:25 Oh no, please don't. There's not enough robot oil in the world.

3219 2018-11-07 18:02:03 As in using a commodity as both an investment vehicle and a means of payment/settlement. That’s abstract. Do U know of any other commodity which settles instantly and will be accepted by financial institutions within the next 3-5 yrs? Try walking into a bank with a barrel of oil.
3220 2018-11-07 18:02:00 I came in for an oil change. These fuckers say I need $1000 worth of work. I've only had it for a year. Bitch...

3222 2018-11-07 18:01:51 That is a tough thing to experience. It is probably true that, with intelligence we could feed far more humans across the planet if we could grow enough veg. I guess we could live without leather, using more oil derived plastics. The dairy industry would be tricky to manage too.

3227 2018-11-07 18:01:08 And Greenpeace, Dogwood, Sierra etc say nothing while rail cars of oil roll down the banks of major salmon river in BC and through our towns and cities. Rail far more dangerous than a pipeline that can be turned off.

Not that Russia invaded
3235 2018-11-07 18:00:13 Not only that, but you've got a 2 to 3 frame connection and it feels like you're playing in oil

3243 2018-11-07 17:59:54 I was visiting my uncle and the first thing he did when he saw me was run to his bathroom, grab tea tree oil, run back, and put it all over my face. He gave it to me and said "This will help with the ugly." 

I know he was talking about my psoriasis and he means well but still.

3245 2018-11-07 17:59:43 @benoitfaucon
Benoit, how do you think Russia is going to transport Iranian oil into her territory? That's barely possible, IMO.
The only sensible way to use Iranian oil is to supply Essar refinery (Rosneft is co-owner) which at least used to rely on it in the past.
3246 2018-11-07 17:59:30 Dam papi you can’t see that when you have your shirt on mmmm love it want to rub oil all over you please mmm

3255 2018-11-07 17:58:18 How much did oil consumption drop in 2008/09?
3256 2018-11-07 17:58:14 So the Americans in rural areas should quit providing food, oil and gas refinement, and many other commodities made on our farms, ranches and lands?  Hope they don't get hungry.
3257 2018-11-07 17:58:10 When the government decided to seize the during the nationalization of the oil industry, and then made the socialistic promises to pay for everything... they made a big mistake. It never works. You are seeing that live out in real time.
3258 2018-11-07 17:57:56 You are sold out of reserved seating at time, correct?

3261 2018-11-07 17:57:31 + important component of BRI. It is not merely a trade route. Small-scale industries along the route can feed entire indo-pacific region with little transportation cost. Besides it will make China's oil import from middle east much cheaper.

3266 2018-11-07 17:56:31 Trump's problem is that getting his way is the only "cooperation" he's interested in. The money his plutos have used to create this artificial boom is going to run out sooner or later & the result will likely be violent. War profiteers, oil barons & their ilk will be the targets.

3283 2018-11-07 17:54:25 Shut up @SenMajLdr We all know what you are doing. You're a master manipulator but we're not buying the snake oil your selling. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. Time to stop your gravy train. #InvestigateTrump
3284 2018-11-07 17:54:14 just touched my face with basically motor oil on my hands. goingbreakouts

3286 2018-11-07 17:53:43 And you might research CBD oil? I’m not sure of all its helpful qualities, but that might be one.
3287 2018-11-07 17:53:41 no idea on a who's who about anyone's gods
3288 2018-11-07 17:53:19 Overestimated my tolerance and ate too much rice that I splashed a lil @sweetblues420 olive oil in when I cooked it, now i'm at work laughing at nothing. Send help!
3289 2018-11-07 17:53:17 Great send me your address.  I have a couple drums of motor oil to get rid of and it’s cheaper to dump it and the cancer is causes on your front lawn.  Don’t say shit because horaaay capitalism

3291 2018-11-07 17:53:09 i keep seeing ads for an oil company on my timeline and I have to wonder what's the point of advertising if you're just an oil company. just to try and get people to like you?
3292 2018-11-07 17:53:08 @narendramodi @DefenceMinIndia huge corruption in BRO Arunachal pardesh Vartak. Contractor sold cement which supposed to reach 127 RCC, 91 RCC and 125 RCC. Every commander and OC has involvement. Same thing in IOCL oil supply contracts. Please investigate..

3295 2018-11-07 17:52:47 I think I cooked my eggs in the reused oil we saved from cooking fish
3296 2018-11-07 17:52:42 The United States would 100% use the obvious voter suppression in the midterms as an excuse to invade another country to steal their oil.
3297 2018-11-07 17:52:35 Remember the movie a day without a Mexican! How about a new movie. California without oil. Show what California would look like without oil and any products related to the oil industry. The movie could open with a scene of the Mojave Desert covered with windmills and solar panels
3298 2018-11-07 17:52:27 The country's changing Gary. Twenty years ago, a piece of bread got brought into a restaurant, you got a lump of butter with it. Now you get olives, oil and vinegar.
3299 2018-11-07 17:52:24 I’m a pacifist and prefer non violent celebration. I’m sure my favourite of their  gods Ganesh would agree.
3300 2018-11-07 17:52:17 That is factually incorrect.  As part of the deal FSI was going to subtract the costs of demolishing the existing stadium and land cleanup from their purchase price.  (There is major oil seepage into the ground there that needs to be cleaned up.)  SDSU will not play games.  FMV.
3301 2018-11-07 17:52:11 @elonmusk ever consider bringing solar to canada? Our country claims to support the Paris Climate Agreement but we are also starting new projects on oil and natural gas extraction. Has our government even tried to reach out to you yet?
3302 2018-11-07 17:52:09 There’s nothing wrong or negative with the tweet it’s all facts. Like I said, it’s  MY Twitter and I’ll continue. If you wanna wear foundation, put oil, and stand at a window and say “my skin is doing wonders ” go ahead am I holding you?
3303 2018-11-07 17:51:53 You gave an #opinion based on your #bias & time will tell how feasible it will be with a #US  policy full of #hypocrisy.
How long the #oil #ChabaharPort #trade by #Iran 
will be "tolerated" by a #US #Adm which is already on a #collision course with #Iran is anybody's guess.
3304 2018-11-07 17:51:38 And then fish oil to help me concentrate
3305 2018-11-07 17:51:35 I need to get tea tree oil and witch hazel 
Tobi' s face literally made me go get Rosewater and glycerine
3306 2018-11-07 17:51:32 With reimposed US sanctions on Iran, defiant Iranians, including their foreign minister, found relief of sorts in a US Treasury list that banned a sunken oil tanker.  Way to go BuckO in the Whitest House!
3307 2018-11-07 17:51:28 Legend. Use black castor oil sis
3308 2018-11-07 17:51:23 It sets back oil drilling a fracking from school and residential areas and schools. Colorado just showed it cares more about corporate profit rather than human health
3309 2018-11-07 17:51:17 Stop buying products with palm oil is also efficient!!!!
3310 2018-11-07 17:51:02 we already have oil

I've spent so much money and time fixing small things
I'm actually going back to Subaru
Service kit(oil filter, air filter) is 10k na bado engine oil
Xtrail service kit is 5k and this is from Nissan Kenya
NEVER BUY A TIIDA!!!!
3313 2018-11-07 17:50:46 Waiting for my oil to get changed at Walmart and found 2 @Lauren_Daigle CDs. So pumped.
3314 2018-11-07 17:50:30 another small episode but still no leak evident, so presumably just a bit of the old oil left on engine. thanks for asking
3315 2018-11-07 17:50:27 Ko mapostori are you still healing people with cooking oil  ? #NemaMiriroAkaitaZvinhu
3316 2018-11-07 17:50:16 But he would rather allow frackers to extract all reserves asap if the future is all renewables. Who will consume oil..??
3317 2018-11-07 17:49:53 But not for long. For oil and gas industry to stay in business, it must gobble up more and more. Absolutely insatiable.
3318 2018-11-07 17:49:47 Iran Says Saudis, Russia Must Cut Oil Supply After Failed Boost- BBG #OOTT
3319 2018-11-07 17:49:41 Yeah there's different kinds - oil, balm, liquid, capsules, gummies etc at all different mg strengths - there's 3 sites I'm checking into
3320 2018-11-07 17:49:38 Coconut oil... I swear by it!
3321 2018-11-07 17:49:31 With the oil wagon.
3322 2018-11-07 17:49:13 Great thinking for Alberta! Get rid of oil & ranches. Brains are badly in need a reboot.

Oil and water.
3326 2018-11-07 17:48:40 @DaveRamsey just wondering-has anyone actually ever changed their Harley oil in your living room?? You use that situation when discussing rental properties all the time, I just had to ask! Love your show by the way!
3327 2018-11-07 17:48:21 Topic was and is, that big clubs like Barca, Real and some other ruined financial fair play long time ago. Not City and PSG now, oil money - does it really matter where it comes from?
3328 2018-11-07 17:48:20 All of the oil industry supports the CTax so get over it.
3329 2018-11-07 17:48:18 Preview of what's to come.
Winning the House has made them all more aggressive and validated tactics. 
3330 2018-11-07 17:48:16 Is her name Monica?
3331 2018-11-07 17:48:12 finally got my oil changed, filter changed and tire rotation

because ya girl was pushing 6 months since my last one ... I was slacking
3332 2018-11-07 17:48:06 it's called a circular firing squad. 

Taxes are from salaries paid by FGN from sale of crude oil....

The Government has no money of her own....
3333 2018-11-07 17:48:02 Sitting at the oil change place listening to a guy having a conversation about someone sueing all people involved in a low speed car wreck because he has lost the ability to enjoy life.

3335 2018-11-07 17:47:48 Ford’s CPC lost thousands of jobs just to protect outdated energy source. Capitalism is holding us back! If markets were truly free, oil and coal would’ve been phased out YEARS ago
3336 2018-11-07 17:47:47 We also will not stop wars for oil.
3337 2018-11-07 17:47:45 No point makin the rules if they just fine em! The fuckin oil revenue would make it irrelevant!! Backhanders or wha!#YNWA

3341 2018-11-07 17:47:27 This coconut oil in my hair shit I’ve been on is workinggggg it’s growing I believe it
3342 2018-11-07 17:47:20 I challenged Douglas Alexander about BPs investments in 2014, he still maintained Oil and Gas was running out. Another Labour charlatan, son of a preacher man I believe. Should be up the Barras selling 3pairs for a £ sports socks. Instead of law firm advisor.
3343 2018-11-07 17:47:19 and it only screws with your head does nothing for pain. Instead of making marijuana legal we should educate more about CBD oil which will help with pain and anxiety and other things. its available in a oil, or a pill, and other versions those are just the two i know for sure
3344 2018-11-07 17:47:13 It's appalling that you actually work for The Times.   You obviously don't care that Hillary was against LGBT rights, voted for wars for oil, helped corrupt bankers, made weapons deals with the Saudis, and ignored climate change.  Some people actually read policies.

All so he can provide the most for Amber, Luna, and I. He’s working so hard to make our future bright. So proud of this man.“Let’s get this bread”

3348 2018-11-07 17:46:52 The Knights Templar own all the gold. National Treasure was a documentary!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3349 2018-11-07 17:46:51 So we got our oil changed at our local @walmart yesterday. So I've typically avoided their stores in general due to bad experiences, but when we got our car back, it was completely infested with flies. Like my passenger couldn't even get into the car with how bad the swarm was.
3350 2018-11-07 17:46:48 Ps  I had forgotten until today that the  Stock Exchange was closed in 1973 following oil discovery and was then operated out of London
Hmm 
3351 2018-11-07 17:46:47 Of wine the more middle, of oil the top, and of honey the bottom is best
3352 2018-11-07 17:46:47 Or chocking (metaphorically) on money stuffed into their mouths from people who have lots of it .....people who have links to oil 
3353 2018-11-07 17:46:40 I literally just fell into a oil drilling hole by accident and found one lol that’s the only one I’ve found so far. Pretty sure they’re all in the desert areas
3354 2018-11-07 17:46:11 Depends really. It could be argued that bar those clubs owned by oil rich oligarchs/ sheiks all clubs are feeder clubs. But yes, as true feeder clubs make no real money as they just provide the training/ development for the parent club who have the same owners
3355 2018-11-07 17:46:08 As long as oil is booming and diesel is cheap i dont give a fuck who is in senate, the house, or even the president
3356 2018-11-07 17:46:05 Does anyone know why a Firebird oil burner keeps tripping to require the red reset switch to be pressed?
#heatingoil #heating @FirebirdBoilers
3357 2018-11-07 17:46:04 Long Canadian heavy oil producers here with max pessimism seems like the play. Way too much light oil and gasoline, but a shortage of distillates that continues and is getting worse. WCS differential should improve immensely here in the coming months with a shortage of heavy oil.
3358 2018-11-07 17:46:00 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
3359 2018-11-07 17:45:18 strongly dislike cruz and im not trying to be rude, but there is no reason to legalize marijuana. the thing in marijuana that helps with pain and other such things is CBD oil which is perfectly legal. The THC is the only thing that makes marijuana different
3360 2018-11-07 17:45:16 Bummed that big oil convinced WA voters to reject I-1631, a fee on carbon polluters. Here's to hoping we can convince every new rep going to the house to be come climate radicals. The truth is, anything less than radicalism isn't enough.
3361 2018-11-07 17:44:54 As for castor oil batho ba byang heh?
3362 2018-11-07 17:44:38 Virgin oil? How do you know if it still?

3364 2018-11-07 17:44:04 Return to oil production cuts in 2019 cannot be ruled out - OPEC sources: A return to oil production cuts by OPEC and its allies next year cannot be ruled out, two OPEC sources said on Wednesday, to avert a possible supply glut that could weigh on prices.
3365 2018-11-07 17:43:33 To every Oil Company operating in the state of California help the new governor go green shut down all OIL & GAS production in the state of California. No gasoline, diesel fuel, Aviation fuels, natural gas production, motor oils and lubricants. Help California go green!!!!!!!!!!!
3366 2018-11-07 17:43:22 Someone with chronic illness experience suggested to me the use of cbd oil (cannabinodiol) & it's legal in all 50 states. I'm gonna check it out soon & see how it goes.
3367 2018-11-07 17:43:16 Sitting waiting for my car while it’s getting an oil change. No TV here. But from the looks of my news feed, I guess that press conference went well? 
3368 2018-11-07 17:43:14 I akways add a little coconut oil to kale, it makes it easier to scrape into the bin.

3375 2018-11-07 17:42:40 I have a start up idea that I’ve had for years. It has always taken the back seat to my oil business. Now with the pizza business it’s more feasible.
3376 2018-11-07 17:42:33 The affected countries had enough savings and investments which they used in cushioning the effects of the crash. Nigeria had nothing to show for revenue generated during the oil boom era. This is the undisputable reason we experienced recession.
3377 2018-11-07 17:42:14 I’m going to have to start importing oil to myself illegally once this $1/gallon tax credit hits. Hmu at the underground gas station for the cheapest gas in Wisconsin. 

@Tony4WI pls don’t force my hand here

3381 2018-11-07 17:41:50 ok to use grape seed oil to season the pans? According to cooks illustrated, that's the best oil to use based on their tests although they didn't test avocado oil. I've used Avocado oil which seems to work better even but 2x price of grape seed.
3382 2018-11-07 17:41:24 How could you support an amdendment like 112???? Knowing hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs and so many families would be affected? If you don’t support oil and gas,  stop driving your car; using your phone, watching tv, and waaaay more.

3390 2018-11-07 17:40:34 Oil prices rose after falling to its lowest since August, supported by a report that Russia and Saudi Arabia are discussing whether to cut crude output next year.
3391 2018-11-07 17:40:13 All the things we're facing make us question it 
Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please
3392 2018-11-07 17:40:10 I remember very well, when an OP manager in an oil servicing firm approached us with a problem. The payout supposed to be life changing, but he tricked us, stole our idea and made a whole lot of money from it. When we approached him, he looked us right in the eye and said
3393 2018-11-07 17:40:08 Oil and gas spokespeople are trying desperately to say the loss of Prop 112 means everyone is okay with O&G development.  Even after the $40 million sledgehammer we experienced, over 825,000 Coloradans sent the message that business as usual won't cut it.  #coleg #copolitics
3394 2018-11-07 17:40:04 Well. All oil have escaped :P
3395 2018-11-07 17:39:56 i voted for salmon.... you can't eat oil.... and You are better off than me; i'm allergic to chocolate....  i guess the thought is: get the money today and let tomorrow starve,  good-bye fish and bears and humans. maybe they deserve to starve.
3396 2018-11-07 17:39:50 When will Diwali fireworks be over. My dogs are going mental and I’m basically exhausted.
3397 2018-11-07 17:39:35 Oil prices fell after a 7th consecutive increase in US crude stockpiles, rising 5.8 million barrels
3398 2018-11-07 17:38:58 I need to get my car service and details ASAP and I need a oil change
3399 2018-11-07 17:38:53 you dont have to make butter you can easily make it into vegetable oil or just use dabs
3400 2018-11-07 17:38:44 Iya bagus juga kok karena dia mengandung oil juga jadi bisa bantu melembabkan muka
3401 2018-11-07 17:38:35 coconut oil is magical. use it three times a week a couple of hours before you wash your hair.
3402 2018-11-07 17:38:34 Somebody needs a service and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
3403 2018-11-07 17:38:33 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3404 2018-11-07 17:38:27 stop using makeup wipes! 1. they’re drying as hell 2. they bad for the environment 
all u gotta do is take a big ass glob of coconut oil (or any cleansing oil) and massage it into ur skin and boom it melts ur makeup off way better than wipes and is nourishing instead of drying
3405 2018-11-07 17:38:26 The clock is ticking on my gubernatorial shitshow so, if you want a new oil lease, fracking permit, a new injection well, state subsidies to help with low lake levels, or just want me to mindlessly recite your talking points, whip out those wallets cause I'm Working For Oklahoma!
3406 2018-11-07 17:38:08 Waxy Wednesday! Ask your budtender about our deals on all dabbable wax and oil today including some of our faves from Mammoth Labs and more.
3407 2018-11-07 17:38:08 “You’re”.... you’re talking about reading and you don’t have basic English down.  Renewables are being invested in and produced, but they can’t replace oil at this time.  So what are you suggesting?  We stop using 96% of the energy until then?  You’re beyond naive.
3408 2018-11-07 17:38:00 I pulled into a 12:30 appointment at 12:20 the car place and they told me my oil change is gonna take 3 hours are you kiiddding
3409 2018-11-07 17:37:49 It's not a failproof for sure, but it doesnt hurt. That and it seemed last year there wasnt a lot of cohesiveness/playing for the guys in the room. IMHO it speaks to the boys looking out for each other. That being said i love my Oil so bias may play a role:)
3410 2018-11-07 17:37:41 What about Roughnecks? They are the guys on ground on oil drilling rigs that do all the heavy lifting.
3411 2018-11-07 17:37:39 Well she ain't said no has she  Dee if you are smuggle some cooking oil, salt and chip shop curry sauce powder in your knickers. Just because lol.

3413 2018-11-07 17:37:18 The Carbon Tax--a gas tax, home heating oil tax,  plus--remains politically toxic.
It has already brought down politicians in Australia and Canada.
Nov 6:
 Deep Blue Washington state voted down a carbon tax. (Again) 
Missouri and Utah killed proposed gas tax hikes.

3416 2018-11-07 17:36:35 I can't see the replies for some reason so no idea if anyone mentioned it. Tea tree oil a skin relief tropical spray for dogs. I tend to give my dogs yogurt at times that very good for them. A tip I learnt from breeding cocker spaniels from other breeders.
3417 2018-11-07 17:36:33 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
3418 2018-11-07 17:36:31 That sounds like it would look really freakin cool
3419 2018-11-07 17:36:18 They act as if they are using the transformer as a learning ground....today the cable hot burnt...yesterday they top up the oil in the transformer. ..tomorrow the transformer itself may be missing. ...it is becoming a joke bit I am not laughing. ...you guys better resolve it
3420 2018-11-07 17:36:10 As a Floridian, this made me so mad. I wanted to vote no out of pure principal of lumping these two together but keeping oil drilling to a minimum was too important for me to vote no. UGH. My Yes vote will only encourage more of this 
3421 2018-11-07 17:36:05 Usually diwali celebrated for 3 days. Thrayodasi evening we fill water into boiler after cleaning bathroom & vessels there. Light yama deepa. Next day Chaturdasi morning all take bath with symbolic oil massage in front of God&bath given by mother for young ones & wife for married
3422 2018-11-07 17:36:04 It was super easy to make! Firm tofu + lemon zest + lemon juice + garlic + salt + drizzle of olive oil, process to desired consistency, serve with roasted eggplant, tomato sauce, and sauteed spinach.
3423 2018-11-07 17:36:01 Truth and oil are ever above.
3424 2018-11-07 17:35:58 Lavender and Melaleuca are amazing anything skin related. If you have an unscented lotion add 4 drops of each oil to it before you put it on.
3425 2018-11-07 17:35:50 Prep live clams b/f cooking by putting in tub of cold water plus dash of sesame oil overnight. Why? It encourages them to ‘spit’ out any sand inside their shells. #momscookingtips

3433 2018-11-07 17:35:02 They  should adhere the treaty on nuclear deal signed in cinsultation UN Assembly but US unilaterally cancelled the treaty ans imposed sanctions on oil export. Once you are the best friend of US NATO ALLIES..NOW THEY ARE ANTI IRAN  NOW DEMOCRATS ARE IN MAJAORITY IN HOUSE.THEY MAY

3435 2018-11-07 17:34:52 Did he not get a massive donation from big oil/pharmaceutical? Second to Cruz?
3436 2018-11-07 17:34:07 Imma be patient but I’m telling you now I’m trying to get you sold out with the new products and dream skin oil .
3437 2018-11-07 17:34:07 Shout out to that time i got peppermint oil in my eyes.
3438 2018-11-07 17:34:03 I just got a random rose hip and avocado oil so we’ll see if that helps I mix it in with my moisturizer. I am on almost one my second bottle of #Halo and it’s honestly helped soo much! I love it. I live in New Hampshire and the air is just so damn dry this time of year.
3439 2018-11-07 17:34:00 That every celebrity endorsement failed 
3440 2018-11-07 17:33:52 That's like saying take the oil out of Norway, or the tourism out of Spain.
3441 2018-11-07 17:33:45 Peshwari naan without nuts too at my local curry house would be a challenge. Basically a plain naan cooked in heaven knows what oil to be allergen free
3442 2018-11-07 17:33:41 I know we love Christmas decorations but nothing like walking into Walmart and seeing the gallon peanut oil and turkey fryers up front
3443 2018-11-07 17:33:32 DD sells the worst donuts. All sugar, all additives, mostly GMOs, all made with bad oil.
3444 2018-11-07 17:33:30 Definitely had NOTHING to do with the province going into a recession because the price of oil tanked right!?   Lol what a stupid uneducated thing to say.
3445 2018-11-07 17:33:28 Florida also outlawed offshore oil drilling and vaping. NEVER use the expressing "good news" in reference to Florida, not even to face-eating cannibals.
3446 2018-11-07 17:33:27 But *why* would you put cannabis oil in hot chocolate?
3447 2018-11-07 17:33:11 Hi Charles,  what do you think of the energy market and oil stocks? Have a Blessed Day.
3448 2018-11-07 17:33:05 修正入ると見た。(フェスかリグマやろーな)
3449 2018-11-07 17:32:56 U should be mature enough.
Oil prices are linked to international market. It's $75 a barrel now. In 2014 it come down to $44 a barrel.
What we demand is the reduction of taxes on petrol which was imposed by PPP in 2008 and still in place.

3450 2018-11-07 17:32:54 During this time of the year, I can never get enough oregano oil!
3451 2018-11-07 17:32:42 I must be out of touch here but when did an oil change cost over $70 (w tax)?? No synthetic oil here! Wow!
3452 2018-11-07 17:32:36 I’m trying to mind my own business and get an oil change and this weird bald white man in the car next to me won’t stop staring at me with his mouth open LISTEN HERE YOU PERVERTED QBALL
3453 2018-11-07 17:32:34 The article does not mention about any oil reserves found. Only exploration going on. And i find your assumptions of USA conquering Africa hilarious if not naive. What would the US gain by conquering Africa? Wouldn't it be contravening international laws?
3454 2018-11-07 17:32:26 It might be from what you’re eating... girl put some tea tree oil on your forehead over night, it’ll work!
3455 2018-11-07 17:32:22 $140 for an oil change on my car  I just had to get a sports car Hahahaha.          I’ll get it over it later
3456 2018-11-07 17:32:21 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
3457 2018-11-07 17:32:08 If it is a continuous audit, it will never be over. I have never heard of a continuous audit. Anybody else? A continuous audit implies to me that he has done something that needs continuous auditing.
What a snake oil salesman.

3461 2018-11-07 17:31:29 Being an adult is having to use your lunch break to get your oil changed.
3462 2018-11-07 17:31:22 Someone pick me up Avondale dodge car gonna take 2 hours for an oil change
3463 2018-11-07 17:31:17 Highest price shop for oil change in Tampa. I called corporate and they are the rudest people ever!! Do not go there. Again the highest price oil change and corporate doesn’t care!!!!
3464 2018-11-07 17:31:12 If the reasons given are how he inflicted recession on us, you're absolutely incorrect. Recession is simply the crash of crude oil price which affected virtually all oil producing countries of the world.
3465 2018-11-07 17:31:10  Congratulations Congressman Rouda!!  Please keep Big Oil out of our beautiful Pacific Ocean 
3466 2018-11-07 17:31:09 No te acabes gas & oil 
3467 2018-11-07 17:31:08 Canada's *cough AHEM cough * 'Liberal media' hard at work. 
The oil industry and these 5 Conservative nitwits who are directed by it will deny #climateaction right up to when the waves start to lap against their ankles OR they figure out a way how to get rich off it. #cdnpoli
3468 2018-11-07 17:31:08 I get mad every time I go to @WholeFoods because they sell snake oil like oscillococcinum right next to bona fide medicines that actually work. I’m ashamed to live in a country where this is legal.
3469 2018-11-07 17:31:01 Cannabis garlic infused olive oil sounds GREAT
3470 2018-11-07 17:30:52 i failed... coconut oil
3471 2018-11-07 17:30:38 I use 10% cold pressed marula oil or rosehip oil by The Ordinary to lock in moisture and I exfoliate my body manually with queen helene scrub

3474 2018-11-07 17:30:25 Very true free radicals, main problem being cooking oil
3475 2018-11-07 17:30:22 The three day leftist Goldfish bowl circumnavigation:
Yesterday: Delingpole's taking the Big Oil shilling
Today: Delingpole isn't making any money
Tomorrow: Delingpole lacks intellectual consistency
Then it's back to Big Oil
3476 2018-11-07 17:30:19 I’m sure oil and gas will  be a drag on all indexes as well.  There is a price dislocation between stocks and oil futures with supply spilling over
3477 2018-11-07 17:30:12 Some naturally raised chicken with a little bit of avacado oil and some basic spices!
Makes the best clean stir fry 
3478 2018-11-07 17:30:12 Amy what is a good oil to add into my nightly skincare routine? Winter is here and present lol
3479 2018-11-07 17:30:11 You guys are soo negative! Yes it sucks Gillum didn’t win, BUT Florida banned dog racing and off shore oil drilling. We also got admendment 4 passed! That’s a big W in my eyes.
3480 2018-11-07 17:30:09 We do nothing as a state but continue to sabotage our own progression.
As long as the lobbyists for Mylan and Oil companies have Charleston by the balls nothing with change.
Especially with a population that believes anything Fox News reports or anything Joe Manchin says.
3481 2018-11-07 17:30:07 i dont understand. all the wars US is fighting hundred years now are for the dollar and oil.  here academics talk `geopolitics play a role.. in energy commodities..` libya, iraq were against yuor hegemony
3482 2018-11-07 17:30:06 Stock pile on oil shares instead ;)
3483 2018-11-07 17:29:59 We in production, we producing food,  SDG agriculture is the new oil, the new gold and the new manufacturing industry. Talk to a farmer, a smallholder farmer, we @ JoJa Modern Farms are in the business.
3484 2018-11-07 17:29:49 I'm guessing from the syntax that's Trump. So the guy that let the EPA get raped by Big Oil and Big Coal is selling himself as someone who gives a shit about the environment? Of all the whoppers he's told that might take the cake.
3485 2018-11-07 17:29:22 Trump  n CNN! ...lol

Oil and Water , they dont mix...

See how he shut down the CNN whitehouse correspondent!
3486 2018-11-07 17:29:16 My hope is that since Trump is talking about the importance of clean air & clean water he knows Secy Zinke has to be fired before House committees investigate his corrupt deals with his oil and gas corp friends.
3487 2018-11-07 17:29:05 that's crucial. It's not that bad a loss because the economy is pretty good, but healthcare, oil, school costs are up
3488 2018-11-07 17:28:56 Yo are you ASE certified? Also want to come in next week for oil change
3489 2018-11-07 17:28:53 $365 later and I have a new battery, air filter, oil change, wind shield wipers, and part of my car insurance for the month. Yay adulthood.
3490 2018-11-07 17:28:51 The project affected persons(PAPS)   of the TILENGA project in the oil and gas exploration activities in buliisa district complains of unfair compensation rate by the oil company and also lacks financial literacy.#ngwedosubcounty

3493 2018-11-07 17:28:35 ...the same media guys who asked you to stop consuming coconut oil & U wondered how ur grandpa survived 102 years consuming it. Go write red meat on Bakri..
3494 2018-11-07 17:28:23 Pep Boys charges $25 if you bring your own oil. You’re welcome.
3495 2018-11-07 17:28:21 @mensamusic @panjianoff 
Imagine this. Nevada went through the same problem. Yet still we have a cash crop capable of fetching billions. But it's a crime?
Digging oil, which kills almost everything else. That's fine.
3496 2018-11-07 17:28:11 Step 1. An end to oil and gas drilling/exploration. Step 2. Energy efficiency. Step 3. Stop dairy and beef expansion. Step 4'no new motorways. Step 5 stop airport expansion. Step 6 electrify public transport.7. ,Native woodland.8. No parking at Leinster House. #doughnuteconomics
3497 2018-11-07 17:28:02 Voters in Florida voted 2 prohibit oil & gas drilling in offshore areas under state control. Farther offshore, the waters become federal jurisdiction. The amendment doesn’t block transport of oil or gas from federal waters through state waters to FL ports.

#George_Soros is the reason the whole world is under attack by Terrorists. Soros with his tricks brough the occupied regime of Iran so he can take the oil cheap and did not care about the consequences. So Shame on you for this collaboration.

3502 2018-11-07 17:27:30 Showed up an hour ago for an oil change and tire rotation. Was told 45-60 mins. Guess who’s living large on the tail end of the bell curve!!! Also my class starts in five minutes and I’m a 15-minute drive away and have no way of contacting my class to let them know I’ll be late
3503 2018-11-07 17:27:30 What's Your Jewish Problem with other people's Oil? You got a problem?  My friend Lionel Juan can fix you.
3504 2018-11-07 17:27:16 Try sugar mixed with soap..a trick I learnt years ago to get oil off...might work?
3505 2018-11-07 17:27:10 The fact was that just like the current failing shambles of a Government her lot presided over a complete disregard to generate enough housing stock because they don't give one. The money including North Sea oil revenue went into the pockets of the few. Tory 101
3506 2018-11-07 17:27:04 I love that this has a recipe for roux though, I've always wanted to make curry from scratch.

Oh and salad oil for outside of Japan purposes is basically any neutral flavored cooking oil.

3509 2018-11-07 17:26:59 It's not for everyone Sha.  Some people react to it. You could try olive oil or udeaki
3510 2018-11-07 17:26:59 Because, you know - he has both postures to choose from: snake oil salesman and war-like posture.
3511 2018-11-07 17:26:34 I’m just not ready to start paying and taking my car to get an oil change 
3512 2018-11-07 17:26:33 Kara is my savior from picking me up from the mechanic because I don’t think I can stand to sit here and breathe in cigarette smoke and oil and listen to raunchy men conversation any longer

3518 2018-11-07 17:26:13 Oil price is rising again. But yes, I hope in the future with electric cars the Saudis are screwed. And they deserve it.
3519 2018-11-07 17:25:59 forgot to turn off my bluetooth when i took my car to get the oil changed and i could hear @kimpetras blasting through the auto shop
3520 2018-11-07 17:25:54 Sigh. Coconut oil showed me pepper.. Will try this baking soda and black soap.
3521 2018-11-07 17:25:32 It's a bipartisan issue everywhere. Both pro and against; take it from us here in CO where the entire Dem leadership opposed a measely 2500 ft setback of new oil and gas wells from homes, schools, and water sources. CO is a sacrifice zone.
3522 2018-11-07 17:25:32 Blindly following their oil masters like everyone else. Ex: Bernie trashing Brazil for the high Crime of owning their own resources ...like all embattled non empire holdings

3525 2018-11-07 17:25:12 Really? Coconut oil helped with my hair. But I guess it depends on the person or something. I don't know 
I'm try jojoba ooooo. Thank you thank you!
3526 2018-11-07 17:25:00 A million quid is way more than the average punter can bet on an AIM listed oil company. @angusenergyplc could deliver the same for a fraction of the cost - providing they get sustainable oil production rates from the Kimmeridge.

3530 2018-11-07 17:24:46 For example, all the fruit juice manufacturing companies are in Lagos /west, roofing sheets, iron rods, breweries etc all in Lagos and west. What do you have in Rivers? Tell me. Where is the FDI? If shell invests $1 billion in oil drilling, that has minimal impact on Rivers state
3531 2018-11-07 17:24:39 disconnect the fan bypass, over fill with oil, top off with JP and fill the back with .50 ammo and rip its till it takes a ratchet strap to close - charlie mike
3532 2018-11-07 17:24:36 You doubt it? LOL. Rich. He's a murderer who strangled his pregnant wife and 2 precious daughters, who he then submerged in a vat of crude oil. He is a coward who only wanted to spare himself the same fate he subjected his wfe and little daughters. May he rot in your god's hell.
3533 2018-11-07 17:24:29 Trump is the burglar who has just stolen all of your money and sold you some snake oil! Nothing that comes out of his mouth is worthy of anyone's time!

3535 2018-11-07 17:24:27 These are most disappointing #election results I’ve ever seen in #Alaska. No on 1 is going to be as much a failure as was the oil taxation from a few years back. It will bite AK in the ass. I guarantee that.
3536 2018-11-07 17:24:13 Tyres use oil , if I remember its more than one barrel per tyre ?

At least no more dog races, oil drills, and non-violent felons can vote again!
3541 2018-11-07 17:23:23 Into the initial dough mix I add chopped chillies (about 4 medium heat)
80g of grated cheese
A dozen or so thick slices of fried chorizo
A small onion caramalised with a little oil and a pinch of sugar in a pan

2 of 3
3542 2018-11-07 17:23:13 Yeah right. He barely shows up to work and when he does its just to collect his gun and oil money. Imagine how much money you can get pushing solar energy and being the leading producer of Best Educated kids and with the best funded state everything, especially tech and health.
3543 2018-11-07 17:23:11 i’m so disappointed but after all the money big oil companies put into trying to convince us that it was bad i’m not surprised :///
3544 2018-11-07 17:23:00 #MySecretFamilyRecipe you Don’t add oil to the boiling pasta water! And you don’t put butter on rice! >>>> 
3545 2018-11-07 17:22:49 I know! Someone send me some lol
3546 2018-11-07 17:22:33 Add in another R100 for petrol standing in a drive through for 30 min’s for 1 special and 1 chips (Stale chips from old oil on that note!) So maybe add extreme delays on your ad’s as well!

3549 2018-11-07 17:22:01 Good Job Alaska!!!!
The fish will be fine. 
Stop being so dramatic. 
We need oil and mining too!!!
3550 2018-11-07 17:21:51 That’s exactly it! We need provincial leadership to disrupt the current oil market and focus on getting Albertans back to work. Social License hasn’t worked, nor has direct subsidies to other industries.
3551 2018-11-07 17:21:44 More Jedi/JODI Oil Mind Games: ".....these are not the production cuts you are looking for"
3552 2018-11-07 17:21:42 Well, that's most certainly oil and gas related. But yep! It's going haywire up here
3553 2018-11-07 17:21:35 I think if @27MilanLucic gets any suspension, that is not warranted. If you have to punish him, I guess a fine would do it......but the refs need to keep better control of the game if they don't want these types of instances to happen in the future.
3554 2018-11-07 17:21:34 people who buy cans of tuna in vegetable oil are sociopaths. WHY.
3555 2018-11-07 17:21:32 Sweet almond oil!
3556 2018-11-07 17:21:27 It makes me crazy! So many other options: massage, essential oil, REIKI, everything you said above. But MDs/hospitals are dictated to by Medicare/insurers that patients' impressions of how they were treated/good scores will influence returns. This translates into "pain scores."/2
3557 2018-11-07 17:21:25 I love Oklahoma some of the salt of the earth people live here. I am Okie! If my parents weren't here though I totally wouldnt be here because of the politics. I can find a state that has nice peeps and takes care of people not cooperations and oil

3570 2018-11-07 17:20:26 ‘In September, President Nicolas Maduro met in China with his colleague Xi Jinping to obtain $5 billion loan.

Maduro stressed his country should increase the production of crude oil as they send the Asian nation to at least 1 million barrels a day before the end of 2019.’

3580 2018-11-07 17:19:02 The people saying that it’s pointless to do your own oil changes have prolly never worked on their cars before... it’s 100% cheaper and if you know what your doing you know it’s getting done right..

3583 2018-11-07 17:18:57 Negative sir. Oil and gas is not who won the election for Cruz. You think there’s 4million oil tycoons in Texas?  ignorant (uneducated) hyper conservative racists (though they would never say they are)

3591 2018-11-07 17:18:03 My point is if you take oil company investments into account it gives a misleading picture. Real sector FDI discounts oil sector investments which is federal investment. Oil revenue goes to FG. Unemployment is massive in Rivers because there is no real sector FDI.

The decision by the U.S. to grant waivers to eight countries, allowing them to continue to import oil from Iran, has helped ease the tension in the oil market. No longer are oil traders talking about $100 oil.

3605 2018-11-07 17:16:27 "We don’t need oil."

Those pumpkins were harvested from their patch with oil, they got to your store with oil and then to your home with oil. Unless $30 pumpkins are what you're after, we need oil.

3628 2018-11-07 17:14:30 Yes, many of their sponsors are oil/gas companies and then Indspire (an Indigenous-led charity) uses their support and funding to support Indigenous students, education, and success. To me, that is an excellent way for that money to be used given the alternatives(CEO bonuses etc)

3672 2018-11-07 17:10:44 Possibly.  But a lot of oil companies are trying to be silent in craters in clean energy.  That way they can take over those companies and stay rich when the oil dries up.

3829 2018-11-07 16:56:04 Don’t need to see them. I knew what was in them before election. They are a sham. NYT expose exposed what we intuitively knew. Trump ain’t no businessman. He is a grifter. A snake oil salesman.

3831 2018-11-07 16:55:50 I needed you to come get my ma car and take it to get a oil change lol
3832 2018-11-07 16:55:38 Friendly reminder to change your fucking oil in your car
3833 2018-11-07 16:55:29 Sure, jobs in the oil district and tech. Highly specialized areas. Where are all the other jobs? Definitely nothing here in Calgary.
3834 2018-11-07 16:55:22 jojoba oil. You can put it on your nails or really dry parts of your skin like elbows. It's light enough to put in your hair for oil treatments too. It's structure is very close to sebum so your skin absorbs it well.
3835 2018-11-07 16:55:22 I just ordered our cbd vape oil cant wait till I get it
3836 2018-11-07 16:55:08 Nobody would extract oil here if that was the case. So we would probably have $0.00
3837 2018-11-07 16:54:56 I agree with Ted about it not being something to consider in a general diet; better to consume the real food, coconut, or whatever. But when I'm doing the Ironman sort of stuff I do add some MCT oil to my fuel bombs. Would be interesting to know if Ted thinks that is of no value

3852 2018-11-07 16:53:29 I'm stilled peeved that NEVER Trumpers lost us the house in really close races. How can you be upset at a great economy, decimated Isis, NK with less nukes, and U.S. being the top producer of oil. It makes no sense
3853 2018-11-07 16:53:21 I'm pretty happy with a lot of what came about. In my state, we banned offshore oil drilling and greyhound racing, and we got 1.4 million disenfranchised people their votes back. Florida is garbage, but even we did some decent stuff.

3857 2018-11-07 16:53:02 I think Canada and Mexico must have oil somewhere...
3858 2018-11-07 16:52:57 “Canada” doesn’t buy oil. The Irvings do so we must assume your beef is with them. Regardless, we are left to wonder how an export pipeline for tar sands goop will have any effect on the Irving’s business dealings.

3864 2018-11-07 16:52:39 What specifically do you like about oil here? ( not disagreeing, just asking)
3865 2018-11-07 16:52:39 You think so? I gotta see some numbers lol I think it really just applies to refineries, oil, and plants but I see what you saying.

3867 2018-11-07 16:52:33 Quality of life sucks in La. We need good education to attract good employers who pay decent wages. We can't rely on tourism and companies that are killing residents and the environment like the chemical, oil and gas industries. (Not to blame JBE for what he was handed.)
3868 2018-11-07 16:52:31 We got a lot of finishing oil on a few projects so everything is shiny now

3880 2018-11-07 16:51:51 Why was it tracking before?  Lower oil prices mean lower costs for companies (ie. help with profits).

3889 2018-11-07 16:51:20 I stand by what I’ve been preaching IRL. When doing outreach for 1631, I was told to “don’t answer their question, redirect their attention”. If the materials had just said, ‘yes this may cost you $5 a month, but it will hurt Big Oil more long term’...transparency builds trust!

3961 2018-11-07 16:43:44 Dear LaRuse7. Germany is energy reliant on Russia, Saudi, Libya, Nigeria, Iraq. Which of the mentioned above do you think are the most reliable? Apart from that: We pay  they deliver oil and gas. Why should they have an interest in forfeiting billions of dollars?
3962 2018-11-07 16:43:42 Oil production has not slowed but clearly the US market dependency is not (now) a good thing. It was a great thing until the shale revolution but the oil industry and Conservatives don't like to mention that. They'd prefer to blame it on a government that wasn't even in power.
3963 2018-11-07 16:43:42 Don't do that you'll face an FFPR investigation all that dirty oil

3966 2018-11-07 16:43:34 Does the caster oil help with brow growth or does it just keep them healthy?
3967 2018-11-07 16:43:29 Go on then...put some margarine on a shelf and see what grows on it. Leave it a year...nothing grows. Its rubbish. Eat natural foods and cook with natural fats and oil. What wrong with that?

3970 2018-11-07 16:43:17 That will FORCE the rest of the world to take oil off the market, once again, for some sort of price stability, while US LTO and US debt grows and US oil resources get drained. Those folks that think this will all turn out peachy for our nation should have their heads examined.
3971 2018-11-07 16:42:51 Can someone teach me how to change the oil in my car so I dont have to pay like $40 anymore
3972 2018-11-07 16:42:43 He will. Floridians will be unified in anger at the oil rigs popping up in plain view of their favorite beaches.
3973 2018-11-07 16:42:35 They sell olive oil at 2500

3986 2018-11-07 16:41:10 Oi. Okay. Communication error.

BATH IN OIL I AGREE. Completely understand. 

also tip: superdrug’s vitamin E range is lit. I would pay triple for it. My eye cream is sickening.
3987 2018-11-07 16:41:08 And that oil is delivered by "dangerous and dirty" drilling rig technology developed by "evil" Halliburton.  Northern Europe only survives due royalties collected from oil.  Without that you'll would be economically dead.
3988 2018-11-07 16:41:07 Take good care of your health people. Eating your greens is not just advice for little kids. I don't like them raw so I fry with some olive oil.. but not for too long. Just enough to keep them crispy. It works very well
3989 2018-11-07 16:41:04 Snake oil.  You without John McCain will vanish in your Misogynistic roots. Southern women are seeing through the submissive doctrine your Forefathers had laid out for  them Senator.  But on the other hand you are so precious Lindsey.

4008 2018-11-07 16:39:39 Hi, do you guys believe in a slow movement upwards in oil price till the end of this year? Thanks for your thoughts 
4009 2018-11-07 16:39:35 Agreed. 
Watching crude oil, heating oil, and RBOB gasoline futures all go lower while prices at the pump stay stubborn.
4010 2018-11-07 16:39:34 Hes a joke of a GM no clue how he has a job
4011 2018-11-07 16:39:33 I’m ok with this build.  Gulf shoved a lot of crude into the US for midterms.  Billions for disappointment there and ease into Iran sanctions.  MBS looking dumber every day.  They’ll head back to original quotas.  Floating storage and oil on water very low, strong draws coming.
4012 2018-11-07 16:39:24 Alternative industries are available. It's like saying we shouldn't be looking at renewable sources of energy because people in the Oil industry will lose their jobs. We can all train these people for alternative industries
4013 2018-11-07 16:39:13 SBUX hit high today. good indicator to me of typical consumer behavior. 
Nordstrom high-Etsy high. Oil prices depressed, small biz. highly confident. I just don't see the bearish case after October based on valuation.
4014 2018-11-07 16:39:03 @BarackObama The problem isn't really immigration but dirty games and interests  (U.S., France, Russia, weapons, oil, spy games,....) which cause it.

4016 2018-11-07 16:38:56 Oil looking good for a reversal.
4017 2018-11-07 16:38:54 Instead of one-size fits all statewide setbacks at same distance for health & environmental concerns, why not treat oil & gas fairly?  

Every other industry in Colorado is subject to local land-use authority. Common sense & bi-partisan solution gives counties and towns a voice.

4022 2018-11-07 16:38:34 I mean if we have the Atlantic Oceans equivalent of Oil in storage why are you PLEADING with OPEC to OVERPRODUCE??? Just a reminder Oil/Gas Producers and Services sector represents 40% of the S&P 500!

4027 2018-11-07 16:38:03 Oil is the soul of your car’s motor. It keeps every one of its parts moving easily, assimilates overabundance warm, and contains added substances. CESC Liqui Moly offers you the best motor oil. Call James on 08120520593
4028 2018-11-07 16:38:03 You’re burning used motor oil and justifying it because you’re upwind and I’m the brain surgeon?
4029 2018-11-07 16:37:51 it would be an amazing smart way to extend the life of FF reserves for future non-burning uses by hundreds of years...but instead Big Oil is CHOOSING to commit suicide by burning all reserves as fast as possible.

4033 2018-11-07 16:37:02 It’s more about what happened to the service department at @MacHaikFordGT - upsell and decline in overall relationships. I bought everything there. Tires, batteries, oil changes, all service. a major “death wobble” issue changed it all. They set the bar, not I.
4034 2018-11-07 16:36:49 Maier, check your stats.  Northern Europe's crime has skyrocketed with the influx of Syrian "Immigrants" (invaders).  As for Scandinavian countries that have low debt to GDP, you owe that to North Sea Oil, delivered by "evil" private industry.

4055 2018-11-07 16:35:44 President Trump as someone who VOTED for young was guidable enough to INVEST in your policies....Just how are you planning to break the news to OIL/GAS workers that their jobs may have been LOST D/T to the Mid Term lets destroy Oil prices initiative?
4056 2018-11-07 16:35:40 It's Nov already! Time to check your tank is sound for winter and maybe top up before the cold weather brings price increases and spikes in demand for heating oil.
4057 2018-11-07 16:35:34 Tea tree oil, has always done the job for me
4058 2018-11-07 16:35:32 You can fry it with oil or even roast it without anything. So far there's fire
4059 2018-11-07 16:35:25 if only FGN increase oil production by 200%.
Angola with 28m people is producing 1.5 million barrel of oil 
Nigeria with 180m people is producing 1.59.
that is the real problem, 
cut NASS and Presidential Villa  running Cost and divert the money2 recurrent.
equals No Inflation

4061 2018-11-07 16:35:21 I get that you're joking, but cattle oil is some good stuff, especially cold-pressed extra-virgin cattle oil.

4074 2018-11-07 16:33:58 Crude oil isn’t our problem. I hear people say this, our problem lies in management, selfless leadership, The Education we have as nation and above all tribalism. I’m sure our founding fathers achieved our independence on singular purpose of one nation.

4093 2018-11-07 16:32:32 1, No.1 a very likely explanation. Especially if you're hands off (kujia gari uka-service) with servicing. Many mechs exchange your genuine parts with Taiwan's, when you let them do 'Oil change & air cleaner' service in your absence. Be there for service

4096 2018-11-07 16:32:28 To give you guys some figures on my car. 
125 oil change from Valvoline every 3 months 
62 dollars to fill up (premium gas)
Mechanics wanted 125 dollars just to look at something on it
Because it’s not leased the dealership taxed even hard than a mechanic 
Parts 300 and up.
4097 2018-11-07 16:32:20 I see this as the last gasp of the big oil and gas monopolies trying to retain power so they can keep selling their petroleum.
4098 2018-11-07 16:32:13 These lefties are so stupid. They seem oblivious to the fact they can't just change the Constitution. It takes 2/3 of House AND Senate (or Convention of States) just to propose one, & it can't become law until 38 states ratify, which necessarily means some "small, rural" states

4101 2018-11-07 16:32:02 My mom is a CBD oil fanatic and swears it makes everything better and I just feel weird.

4104 2018-11-07 16:31:55 And, to be clear, I have nothing in common with those women apart from a stranger’s ability to mistake us for one another because of the color of our skin. 

We’re oil and water. The loathing is mutual and bone-deep real.
4105 2018-11-07 16:31:54 I think removing finger nails one by one then suspending her over hot oil and dipping her in a mm at a time over a 2 week period

4108 2018-11-07 16:30:45 Sadly, freeing Biafra doesn't in anyway guarantee stability, development or security, especially considering the diversity within and of course, the oil wealth. Take a look at South Sudan as an example.

Africa needs to simply rise up, change our ways of doing things.

4111 2018-11-07 16:30:33 Yeah, the way I see it is there is nothing to be overly concerned with because no one could have seen this start coming. Can it last? Maybe but the same flaws still exist. Also, the kind words are appreciated

4114 2018-11-07 16:30:15 I’m not even mad that DeSantis was elected tbh

the fact that there were 13?? ballot initiatives and ones like RESTORING FELONS RIGHT TO VOTE, Banning dog racing, and banning off-shore oil drilling passed makes me extremely happy. Good direction this state is going.

4118 2018-11-07 16:29:42 Oil is the soul of your car’s motor. It keeps every one of its parts moving easily, assimilates overabundance warm, and contains added substances.
4119 2018-11-07 16:29:36 @hondaofconcord what is the point of having an appointment when it take 2 hours for an oil change?!?! This is absurd and happens EVERY time.

4122 2018-11-07 16:29:17 They have seduced me with the dark chocolate and blood orange biscuits. Can I also say well done for the lack of palm oil (unless it's lurking under a different name, in which case, no).
4123 2018-11-07 16:29:14 All i see is organic oil
4124 2018-11-07 16:29:02 Looking for an electric heater:
I’m looking for either an electric heater, or the kind where the oil will heat up in the Coyles and warm up, they were quiet. My bedroom is quite chilly, and I would like to stay warm at night, that or an electric blanket would be wonderful. Thanks
4125 2018-11-07 16:28:53 (2/3)drill for gas and oil in the Great Lakes and pollute one of the worlds largest fresh water sources in the world. Sorry I want somebody who wants to protect the rights of immagrants and others who are discriminated against daily, and not the person who suppports a president
4126 2018-11-07 16:28:51 Agreed. If you want to go vegan, sub olive oil. butter - not on greens; it ruins the flavor.
4127 2018-11-07 16:28:32 Meanwhile we continue to sell oil below $20 a bbl. why don’t you make that a story ?
4128 2018-11-07 16:28:31 Change oil 
4129 2018-11-07 16:28:23 The Titanic of oil has hit the iceberg, low gas prices might not mean much for much longer.

4131 2018-11-07 16:28:00 Proud of strong showing of Prop 112(to increase drilling setbacks) & decisive defeat of Amdmt 74 (to require govt to pay polluters not to pollute)—despite $30+ million spent by oil & gas! Time for our leaders to finally protect air, water & communities from fossil fuel developmt!
4132 2018-11-07 16:27:47 You're 100% correct on Hall & Eberle but the game has changed on two fronts. One how teams build their rosters and two how games are called. Teams still get away with stuff, especially on 97, but 4, 14 & 93 used to get manhandled & there was no penalty and no response.
4133 2018-11-07 16:27:45 Thank you.
4134 2018-11-07 16:27:38 Why shouldn't you add oil to indomie!?
4135 2018-11-07 16:27:36 Yes, Rosehip oil 
4136 2018-11-07 16:27:31 Go all electric, hybrids are unnecessary. Hybrids have higher maintenance costs, still leak oil and gas into the water, and keep you moored to fossil fuel infrastructure and externalities.

Build for the clean energy future, don't greenwash baby steps.
4137 2018-11-07 16:27:26 Do you think they will stop here, Diya kills insects etc, oil can be given to poor etc . #DiwaliCelebration
4138 2018-11-07 16:27:17 Went to #MarksAndSpencer yesterday, food - all the bread has fractionated Palm oil, Palm Oil.  All the other food seemed to have Palm Oil and Coconut Oil, wth for that stuff is poison!! Lucky we have a Baker still.
4139 2018-11-07 16:27:16 Actually, if the oil price drops enough they might run out of money before running out of oil :) The drop in the last decade has strongly decimated Saudi cash reserves :)

4156 2018-11-07 16:26:09 Spent time in Bukit Luwang Sumatra this year to observe Orangutang and is appalling how much land in Indonesia is used for palm oil which literally cuts them off from their habitat.  Boycott PepsiCo and Koch bros
4157 2018-11-07 16:26:02 Always thought it a form of "market failure" in politics.  One can pontificate about "principles" all the time, but the rule of (democratic) governance is that squeaky wheels get the oil and the ability to squeak (but no more or less) varies depending on endowments and inst.
4158 2018-11-07 16:25:49 I gotta stop putting this olive oil in my hair cuz it’s all on my pillowcase 
4159 2018-11-07 16:25:49 O’Rourke is loving thebeing showered in his direction.

4164 2018-11-07 16:25:14 At least it’s warm and pretty. North Dakota is cold, windy, full of oil rigs, and populated by a few white people who oppress the Native Americans. I exaggerate, but I don’t feel like the small population of white racists should have 2 senators.
4165 2018-11-07 16:24:58 None, and they wage a brutal proxy war in Jemen against Iran. I hope they run out of oil soon, then the whole thousands of the Saudi-royal-family will be done....

4171 2018-11-07 16:24:37 can $spx get above 2800?

4172 2018-11-07 16:24:25 The memories of the impatient waiting for the Aarthi & oil bath on the dawn of Narakchaturdashi after which we could charge outside to set off the firecrackers are indelible in spite of all those decades. These collective #Diwali #memories of are worthy of a #compendium.

4179 2018-11-07 16:23:36 Many congress supporters r asking why tax payer money for statue of unity.  Congress looted lakhs of crores in 10 years from 2004 to 2014.

4180 2018-11-07 16:23:32 For me it seems like the kind of policy that should be worked out in the statehouse and not in a constitutional amendment. Would love to see the state focus on solar and wind over oil and gas.

4203 2018-11-07 16:20:34 I use Vaseline Men Deep Cleanse Face Wash daily. It is a no-frills exfoliating wash which keeps my facial skin soft and me looking rich. Also, I massage my face each night with coconut oil. Some say it blocks the pores and is bad for the skin, but it works for me. God Bless. 
4204 2018-11-07 16:20:30 So we can use Vaseline on the face for a night oil before moisturizer ? They won’t clog the pores?

4213 2018-11-07 16:19:21 @Zimra_11 Good evening
Is it true that we have to pay $20 for cooking oil at the border? Can it be part of the $200 I am allowed to bring in duty free? Would greatly appreciate a response
4214 2018-11-07 16:19:09 It says 643€ monthly.

By the way, what type of oil are they including?
4215 2018-11-07 16:19:05 the problem is whether they can or not. yields are not increasing and neither are imports of higher yielding crudes to offset the gasoline glut. Gasoline levels at record for this time of year. This is what happens when cheap oil runs your decision making and not product cracks

4233 2018-11-07 16:16:50 #ANGS 14p paid I still see 30-45p slice here. When we open the kim up 200m it will be gushing oil and that means cash
4234 2018-11-07 16:16:46 Oil and Gas are Controlled Markets. They fix prices and manipulate markets. Remember when the World almost ran out of oil and gas... shockingly we have tons now... we are just pawns... prices go up every day for no reason. Glut... up... War... up... overstock... up
4235 2018-11-07 16:16:43 At last some thought, much more versatile than batteries,  less load on national grid and no reliance on oil, gas or mining lithium.
4236 2018-11-07 16:16:38 The people in that district did not like her flirtation with oil rigs.  That’s what he bashed her with every single day.
4237 2018-11-07 16:16:36 Very true. But since no one has approved my request for a time machine I guess we'll just have to find a way to pull Alberta out of this slump with less reliance on oil. Good thing I believe our citizens have what it takes to do that.
4238 2018-11-07 16:16:32 @Rosie morning, a pretty good day yesterday for America yesterday How on the money is Lily Buds track Snake Oil Salesman?
4239 2018-11-07 16:16:27 S&P +1.3%, DAX +0.8%.

4240 2018-11-07 16:16:07 Using oil alone doesn’t give your skin the hydration it needs. Oils are protective, they nourish your lipid layer but you need hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate to provide water-based moisture. Go look at my IG.
4241 2018-11-07 16:16:07 Dont put oils on your face!!! 12 hours till home time + a trusted moisturiser won’t kill you! Do what you like but dont come cryin’ when trŪmp comes digging for oil to make his spare coins using your oil slick facade.
4242 2018-11-07 16:16:04 Dont forget to rub enough vegetable oil
4243 2018-11-07 16:16:02 A lot of allergies are turning out to be reactions to the smoke, not the weed itself. And bootleg scratch tests for allergies are being done with whole-plant oil.
4244 2018-11-07 16:15:52 Health experts? Completely wrong science still screaming whole grains, switching fat for sugar & vegetable oil is all great. Hey Yahoo, check out the @netflix doc Magic pill and soon @VinnieTortorich doc called Fat
4245 2018-11-07 16:15:36 I wonder how many kids even ask their parents how to do things or how things work? Do they even want to be involved & grow as individuals?  Taxes, laws, oil/tire change, meal prep/cooking, voting, medical/home insurance, homeopathy, gardening, home repairs.
4246 2018-11-07 16:15:33 If he admits that his son made money through Bosasa! He can also admit that he made his billions through the reserves resources that the old apartheid government had kept as savings underneath mines in Mpumalanga like crude oil he sold to be a billionaire !!
4247 2018-11-07 16:15:32 Well Donny boy; you and Mattis get on the phone with Putin. We will need him and Kim Fu Jong if we are to take down China, Iran, and any other nation that wants to screw with us! Strategy baby! All Putin wants is Saudi and Syrua oil. Give it to him! Watch news media go crazy!
4248 2018-11-07 16:15:21 Your oomf broke d rule, y should he reveal
4249 2018-11-07 16:15:21 And that was due to people building too close to existing oil and gas development not the other way around.
4250 2018-11-07 16:15:15 Best to dilute your peppermint oil rather than apply full force, especially on the face. You can use any carrier oil, such as grapeseed or sweet almond oil.

4258 2018-11-07 16:14:21 Yeah but oil is something we need to downsize regardless, bc environment. Not that I expect people to put quality of life over the life of the planet
4259 2018-11-07 16:14:13 Exactly!!!! RT @_KUSH_: Putting a finger in tha butt, is like checking oil. Gotta see what’s on tha dipstick first

4261 2018-11-07 16:14:07 Regular consumption of fish or fish oil reduce overall risk of death by 17%. Statin drugs reduce total mortality by only 15% and even then only in populations at very high risk of heart disease
4262 2018-11-07 16:13:54 Why are we even funding these death stars? Because these planets have oil. If there were no oil on these planets, the Republic would leave them out to dry. but guess we have to protect the interests of Big Brother.
4263 2018-11-07 16:13:54 LOL the glue is not that bad and if you use a bit  of oil to remove the lashes carefully your natural lashes will stay in tact.

4266 2018-11-07 16:13:26 In the video for ‘Say Say Say’, Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson are snake oil salesmen during the day and blackface performers at night. Also, Jackson tries to seduce his own sister while McCartney literally starts a fire in a crowded theater.
4267 2018-11-07 16:13:25 Wow c'est la poubelle de Oil! À non de Bull...
4268 2018-11-07 16:13:25 I don’t think I am. I was using my oil as my moisturizer. I need recommendations

4272 2018-11-07 16:13:03 EPA rolls back measures to address climate change: i.e. pollution from coal plants, prevention of methane emissions from oil & gas drilling & fuel efficiency standards for cars. Wheeler, acting EPA head: “federal regulations aren’t necessary to drive greenhouse gas reductions”
4273 2018-11-07 16:12:56 @SaddickAdams Lol why palm oil seller no get chance to compete?? Ma guy come again
4274 2018-11-07 16:12:56 #oott The fact that the build was due to another surge in production is even more bearish.  Had exports been the highest for any week on record, inventories still would have built.  The only thing that can stop this flood of oil is price.  Sell
4275 2018-11-07 16:12:52 It’s $250 mineral oil and Vaseline with a splash of sea kelp juice. 

Most successful skin care scam since “you can shrink large pores”
4276 2018-11-07 16:12:36 Except they don’t have oil so maybe not.
4277 2018-11-07 16:12:33 “Reasonable people” is oil and gas speak for “elected officials we bought off.”  Nope, you’re going to deal with reasonable people who represent human beings and not an industry. @ColoradoOilGas better start acting like a responsible industry. #copolitics #coleg

4279 2018-11-07 16:12:26 It does make me chuckle how they all jump to the bs pr line of “sustainable” palm oil . And always quote an acronym of sorts to try and validate their point!!!
4280 2018-11-07 16:12:09 Hayır öyle değil ... 1 varil petrol 72 73 dolar şu an bunun için 'de rafineri de işlendiğinde bir kısmı araçlar için benzin bir kısmı motorin artı fuel oil falan olur çok az kısmı da uçak ve het yakıtına dönüşür işlemlerde. Fiyat onunla alakalı değil hepsi aynı maddeden üretilir
4281 2018-11-07 16:12:05 He's a snake oil salesman.  Ran from debating John Cox since the spring, his past SF policies have exacerbated the homeless situation in SF.  Taxation and more liberal policies to come.
4282 2018-11-07 16:12:02 Yes, I remember the promises made. It was all over the media at the time.  What happened was, Margaret Thatcher took the view that benefits from oil (not just pensions) would make UK workers so well off they would not want to work. So we never benefited from it.

4286 2018-11-07 16:11:50 Absolutely agree with you....let Modi ji manage important issues like statues, election speeches, world tours, kabrastan-samshan..... How can someone blame Modi for oil prices, rafale loot, NPA mess, inflation, unemployment, etc...that's not his job....

4289 2018-11-07 16:11:38 Oil companies outspent supporters by 30x. ($30m to $1m) Supporters had a tiny tiny voice. The flood of opposition ads said this prop would kill jobs and education with no mention of oil/fracking... Plus John Elway was on the opp’s payroll. This prop did better than I expected.

4294 2018-11-07 16:11:25 No less than 50, but partly in a way you can control your own dosage intake. Like, a steak will be marinated in herb oil with 10mgs but also have a chimichuri that has 10mg that one could put on as they wish. We def got some details to figure out but this could be big.
4295 2018-11-07 16:11:12 I used aa hydrator, an oil, and two diff products w hyalauronic acid
4296 2018-11-07 16:11:09 Quick question please - I know that the palm oil we use is from a sustainable source but can someone point me to where that is confirmed (cannot see wood for trees etc)
4297 2018-11-07 16:10:56 But what's wrong to queue for cooking oil? I thought you would say situation is improving

4311 2018-11-07 16:10:05 Dried rat piss with dead dog ashes, ferry dust, special fungus, prayer beads are better. Way more effective. But snake oil is always best if you have snakes & oil press handy. 

It is 2018 time to be politically incorrect shut these snake oil vendors down. Ditto for chiropractors

4318 2018-11-07 16:09:23 Just buy the oil from the collective and use the droppler and put it under your tongue
4319 2018-11-07 16:09:23 (2/2) Second, #oilandgas had v specific messaging to audiences ranging fm Spanish language ads to women on #Prop112. As I watched the debate in final days, appeals to women voters appeared strong from enviros & oil/gas. In the end, the 40:1 spending by oil/gas proved hard to beat
4320 2018-11-07 16:09:18 Actually Suze, both Usmanov and Dangote are big Gooners. It wasn't his fault Stan wouldn't sell & Dangote always said he would be finishing his Oil Refinery before making any kind of bid.
4321 2018-11-07 16:09:08 I feel like if it is replaced by any other kind of oil, as long as the big demand exists humans will keep destroying the environment for it. But yes, the answer would be creating more sustainable ways of producing it.
4322 2018-11-07 16:09:03 Oil's collapse is impressive.  This is surprising considering some of the upside risks that exist.  Slowing econ coming?  or just over supply?
4323 2018-11-07 16:09:02 At times I felt crazy as a former Texas rancher of a dozen years going on about NOT re-electing Ted Cruz

I live in IDAHO

An entrenched politician that lines up with big oil, a shrinking industry bleeding the country

Last night vindication !

The anti-Cruz missile WAS national
4324 2018-11-07 16:08:53 Anyone know how much oil/gas industry is of industrial production? I would assume a decent size and with bear market WTI -- that could be problematic for the dataset in coming qs

4326 2018-11-07 16:08:45 112 defeated (thx to record $50M of industry propaganda) BUT! CO voted out GOP & many Oil & Gas owned politicians. Dems now control all branches of state government. So @jaredpolis, Matt Gray, et al, voters are watching . Let's fix these critical priorities: cc @ConservationCO
4327 2018-11-07 16:08:43 Iraq imports fuel from Iran. The #KRG meanwhile exports around 30,000 barrels of oil to Iran per day. Although the #US, did not name #Iraq among the eight countries given a waiver to continue buying oil from #Iran.

4333 2018-11-07 16:08:23 Unfortunately, it's necessary to continue to be one country, to keep the ignorant assholes from attacking other countries for their oil. They are the ones who want to spend ridiculous amounts on the military. Imagine if they were not held in check by the rest of us!

4342 2018-11-07 16:07:32 world is not looking and listening because no oil in kashmir and india needs to be appeased.

4345 2018-11-07 16:07:18 She was clear that security issues were not a big part of her campaign - medical care, jobs, gas and oil prices.  A little trade because of soy bean and tariffs so maybe HFAC but she will be great wherever she lands.

4350 2018-11-07 16:06:59 Love the look of #BP $bp . Announced that profits doubled year on year, SP yet to move. Massive purchase from BHP end of last month. 

6% annual divi (ex divi date tomorrow incidentally). Broker forecasts are all suggesting plenty of room for upside. Bullish oil price too.

4353 2018-11-07 16:06:50 So I’ve always struggled with finding a gel that doesn’t make my hair hard/crunchy for curl definition. I started using Deva Curl’s “The Curl Maker” and I love it. But before putting that in my hair I started using Shea moisture’s black castor oil leave in and their curl

He's never rushed for a TD there, never thrown more than 1 TD per game there, and has never rushed more than 31 yds per game there. I call that a steamer, not a streamer.
4356 2018-11-07 16:06:36 Sounds like a contest that should be decided by oil wrestling, followed by vigorous showering.
4357 2018-11-07 16:06:34 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

4367 2018-11-07 16:05:44 So, where does the consumer go from here? Consumers hold a significant amount of power in today’s day in age. Completely avoiding palm oil is not only practically impossible but could also be considered unsustainable as so many people depend on the industry for an income.
4368 2018-11-07 16:05:43 I’m down with most spiders, they are amazing engineers. But widows and recluses are out, the risk is just too high. Peppermint oil is great at repelling them, as a non-lethal option.

4375 2018-11-07 16:05:18 I’m not trying to say it doesn’t happen. There are bad people everywhere. I’m just saying people aren’t throwing used oil from their cars in their front lawn or down the drain. Oil companies aren’t disposing of contaminants on my driveway.

4439 2018-11-07 16:00:18 Hmm.where to start: over-regulating the oil production in the US to give Iran a better economy, giving Iran billions of dollars to keep peace, wanting illegals and islamic refugees in this country, really bad on the economy, causing division by making all these victim groups, etc

De hecho, estoy contigo en que no hay ruptura de soportes, entre otras cosas por la divergencia Crude Oil vs Brent q aún se mantiene. Otra cosa es la pauta impulsiva a la baja que se observa.
4448 2018-11-07 15:59:21 On the oil majors, the question seems to be whether they are just opposed to a policy patchwork and prefer the federal venue for how the outcome will take shape, or whether they still support “carbon taxes”, just not any they’ll ever actually met in a legislature or on a ballot.

4490 2018-11-07 15:54:54 I hope not, but we can't just let the world burn because people earn a living making matches.   

Ideally, the drastic reduction in oil and gas will be coupled with an investment in renewables that would allow oil and gas workers to transition into the industry of the future.

4502 2018-11-07 15:54:01 To be fair sometimes the oil change costs less than 5 quarts of oil and a filter
4503 2018-11-07 15:53:53 Bio oil is hella slow. Smh I gave up

4506 2018-11-07 15:53:45 You say you want pipelines to tidewater for our natural resources yet you hire and align yourself as the rest of your party does with the goal of shutting in the Alberta Oil Sands. WTF?

4508 2018-11-07 15:53:42 LPs can import oil derived from anywhere in the world except the USA but that will change shortly. @GovCanHealth @AAFC_Canada have successfully isolated  #hemp industry handing the transformational agricultural opportunity elsewhere. Good to see CHTA acknowledge that

4512 2018-11-07 15:53:33 from our note of last week "we assume that current US crude oil production is already near 11.5 myn b/d", but we had warned about revision higher to US production for few weeks already.

4518 2018-11-07 15:53:14 @sundayriley I cannot believe what I am hearing as a consumer I am in disbelief. I have been committed to your products. And now I don't know what to believe. How do I go about receiving a refund for the night oil I have purchased?

4523 2018-11-07 15:52:32 I can give u a hundred reasons why this govt. is a joke but thn its no use since you blindly trust them. But just one reason is enough for you. UPA was able to provide cheaper fuel with crude oil rates above 120$ but NDA is selling fuel at all time high with crude rates below 80$

4530 2018-11-07 15:52:06 She lost bc she initially supported Trump's plan to drill for oil off the SC coast. Regardless of party, few South Carolinians want to endanger their beaches, coastline and tourism. Arrington spent her entire campaign walking back support for big oil, but the damage was done.
4531 2018-11-07 15:52:01 I've a question. The foundation drops. Someone bought them for me as a gift in a basket of make up. I use oils to moisturizer. Squalane, Marula, and jojoba lately. Can I mix a drop in with the oil I use? Will it settle on th skin the same as lotions because I tend to break out

Those snake oil salesmen sure worked their magic on the uneducatef foolish white sheeple who puppy dog in their wake! Makes me want to retch with disgust. 
4536 2018-11-07 15:51:47 Disappointed that 112 failed but heartened to see how the oil and gas industry proved that with $40 million and a bottomless bucket of bullshit you can convince people to vote against a grassroots initiative to protect their air, water, and homes. Truly anything is possible!

4. Sweets - home cooked, chocolates, market?

5. Worship - home, temple, ISKON, etc?
4538 2018-11-07 15:51:36 They'll rub oil on the bald part and add it to their forehead quota. It's actually impressive.
4539 2018-11-07 15:51:36 I wonder about some people. I do title research for oil companies. Basically do title policies on land that oil companies want to drill on so I’m on computer all day.
4540 2018-11-07 15:51:35 In an oil rich nation raking in millions/billions of dollars daily.

4542 2018-11-07 15:51:32 Not good. Big oil should be paying a climate tax or something. I know they’d only pass the cost to consumers but hopefully renewable and more efficient alternatives are created their hold on elected officials with social responsibility will weaken.
4543 2018-11-07 15:51:30 Where does it say that all HF operations, regardless of sector, are regulated by the same rules set by the OGA for onshore oil and gas?

4547 2018-11-07 15:51:16 Very true. But if they’re working on true progressive policies, that would mean they aren’t being corrupted by Big Business, Banks, Oil or any other large corporation. Popular progressive policy helps real people & not wealthy special interests.

4549 2018-11-07 15:51:07 Man you need to go do some more research on this and if you got no problem with it invite oil and gas to set up a pad right next to your house see if you don't get sick and end up in poverty because of your medical bills I'm done wasting time with your dumb ass have a good day
4550 2018-11-07 15:51:06 yes, by the Saudis. They payed the terrorists after all, and a lot of them were from Saudi Arabia. Yet as long as they deliver oil, the world leaders kiss their arse like Trump did recently
4551 2018-11-07 15:51:06 Setting alarm to wake at 4am, doing a small puja, receiving new dresses, taking oil bath, getting out at 5am to burst crackers, returning home for nadaswaram music on TV, calling family to wish, munching sweets till 8am n then leave for FDFS. 20 yr routine. #DiwaliCelebration
4552 2018-11-07 15:51:03 Thing is some people out here are opposed to renewables as well, because they think fossil fuels are a jobs creator. Which isn't really true, coal and oil have decreased production and you can see the effects of it in border towns like Farmington NM.
4553 2018-11-07 15:50:53 I work in the oil industry and sign my own cheques. That lunkhead has increased my marginal tax rate by 10 points at a time that the oil industry is on its knees. It wasn’t broke, Trudeau had no reason to “fix it”. #cdnpoli
4554 2018-11-07 15:50:36 I was thinking that exact thought first thing this morning but waffled. That’s the chickenshit in me. Remember that world oil article I sent you yesterday? I didn’t want to find out I took profit too soon. See I’ve never developed a discipline strategy. Hogs get slaughtered?

4561 2018-11-07 15:49:53 Agreed. Big sugar and big oil both spent big here and won. Deceptive and false language that too many believed. Disappointing result in Colorado as well regarding fracking.

Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil? 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange.
4566 2018-11-07 15:49:19 Shorts will have to let oil go soon.  Can't hold weekend with OPEC meeting #oott
4567 2018-11-07 15:49:16 And not forgetting the definition of veganism, oil, hence petrol, diesel and so on, is made from the bodies of dead animals. On yer bike.
4568 2018-11-07 15:49:15 Oil is not about jobs, its about cash and profit for the rich. Don't be fooled.

4570 2018-11-07 15:49:02 Thanks Man of God I got one who told me to send money to Nigeria since you build a Church in Nigeria. I did introduced my friend to watch Man of God from you tube and she was told to buy sale and anointing oil for $500 each. I have said let's wait and see maybe its not true.
4571 2018-11-07 15:49:00 Love Norway. Other than all that oil you pump... got to pay the bills.
4572 2018-11-07 15:48:57 me: finishes two portions of pad thai, takes out the trash, cleans the pan, brings two bottles of water and cooking oil upstairs from our basement, makes coffee, writes appointment in family calendar
ido: about halfway done with her first portion
4573 2018-11-07 15:48:50 Especially the one with grounded cray fish inside...I eat both abeg...palm oil or groundnut oil...Infact I miss them cos I haven’t taste it in years....
4574 2018-11-07 15:48:48 Sounds far fetched to you? Dem ppl ya barely waah give u two ketchup, why u think they're gonna change the oil often? Wah dem ago get fi tief and carry home? Hssst
4575 2018-11-07 15:48:36 I don't know the % but I will go out on a limb here and say her district is at least 90% Somali, and are quickly pushing outward to the surrounding districts. See how this works folks!
4576 2018-11-07 15:48:36 Changed the oil in my car today
4577 2018-11-07 15:48:31 did the safety millage pass?  thanks
4578 2018-11-07 15:48:27 Free translation would be: “today people celebrate Diwali. They take oil bath wear new clothes pray God and fire crackers. May this Diwali bring prosperity happiness etc to Tamil people”.Does he not read newspapers or at least watch TV. He has mentioned fire crackers 
4579 2018-11-07 15:48:25 Colleague of mine swanned off on an expensive sales trip to the Mid East oil fields, selling diamond drill bits. Made no sales. Reported back "Plenty of potential out there." 
He got fired.

Liam Fox's trade mission is somewhat similar, but with one big difference ...

4581 2018-11-07 15:48:08 That runaway was out of my control there was no way of stopping it! St Denis road work damaged the rail, and the oil refinery was human error!
4582 2018-11-07 15:48:00 #TX07 has more tech or STEM related jobs and residents outside of Silicon Valley.  Huge energy/oil & gas companies and workers are headquartered there.  They now have a rep who will take her cues from the #climatechange lobby.
4583 2018-11-07 15:47:59 my place always says that weekends are crazy. I figured Id get it done while they change my oil or sumn. 

Just show up! lol
4584 2018-11-07 15:47:55 I am old enough to remember when Hamm prematurely unwound all CLR’s oil hedges when the price of oil crashed from $100 to $40 a few years ago. He thought oil would never go below $75. He was dead wrong. I don’t know why people listen to his opinion on the oil market.

4608 2018-11-07 15:46:09 Nah, I'm stunned that passed. A horrible thing for our beautiful state. These folks in the oil and gas industry would drill in your living room if they thought they could make a buck -- and then they leave their mess behind.

Maybe $500 towards my rent? Pay for cleaning services for my home so I can chill?” Lmfao
4611 2018-11-07 15:45:53 Ugh dropped oil on my crop top
4612 2018-11-07 15:45:48 Very true. Without the oil money Citeh & Chelsea would be no more of a title threat than Everton or Watford

4620 2018-11-07 15:45:04 You like your diffuser? I have a humidifier but feel like i want an oil diffuser too. (I know these are two different things but they’ll serve the same purpose for me lol)
4621 2018-11-07 15:45:03 Yeah, i think they don't change the oil they use to fry the chicken often enough, so i think it's the stale oil messing with me
4622 2018-11-07 15:45:00 If only every service was for defence. Not for oil. Or a land grab. Or to line the pockets of the hawks. Duty to fight in a war that isnt defensive is a slave being sent to their (potential) death. Patriotism has been abused by the powerful.
4623 2018-11-07 15:44:53 That's what my Mac does when he has a big hairball. Take this as you will, but when mine do this I give them a couple spoons of the tuna packed in oil instead of water, just a spoon or 2. Usually helps Mac cough it up.

4625 2018-11-07 15:44:39 Okay, but the more drilling, the more accidents, the more oil in the sea and on the sand.
4626 2018-11-07 15:44:35 Texas oil has lots of money and they’re not blue.
4627 2018-11-07 15:44:34 That’s the thing...wealth is measured differently in Texas, so it’s not about cash money. It’s more abt resources like land & oil & water. The wall isn’t abt keeping people out, it’s abt land, agriculture & water. It makes a lot of sense that TX would go red if you know Texas.
4628 2018-11-07 15:44:23 Like Democrats can trust a word out of McConnell’s mouth. Only codependent fools would fall for his snake oil.
4629 2018-11-07 15:44:21 US commitments to that region is iron cast and it's less dependent on oil and gas. Security threats, china's aggression to her neighbors and other juicy foreign aid by the US will forever endeared new friendship for US from that region.
4630 2018-11-07 15:44:17 What kind of oil u got lol

4632 2018-11-07 15:44:07 I expect I have about as much chance of seeing a 2 headed unicorn farting rainbows as it flys across the sky as I do seeing a completed TMX pipeline with oil flowing thru it.

4634 2018-11-07 15:44:04 Ordinarily I would understand that logic - however these are extraordinary times & you have a President who doesnt believe climate change exists and who puts a ‘big oil scumbag’ in charge of the EPA - surely the most pressing issue must be getting him out as a matter of urgency?

4666 2018-11-07 15:40:53 Instead, Coloradoans voted against funding schools, against fixing our transportation issues, and of course they voted for fracking. At least they voted down the absolutely ludicrous property compensation amendment, which was also put on the ballot by oil companies.
4667 2018-11-07 15:40:48 Not all oil is extracted by fracking. Only shale oil is. And there's no current evidence that fracking is dangerous to anything or anyone.
4668 2018-11-07 15:40:40 Quick oil change this morning

4685 2018-11-07 15:38:26 If you think about it, couple hundred thousand oil and gas workers all voted no. Prob 30-40% are dems. You have many biz owners voting no as it hurts their business. Many land owners including my self making money off it.
4686 2018-11-07 15:38:22 Aside Iranian exports of oil and gas to that region, which other influence does Iran has on the region?  

Kindly note that the commodity called oil is going to be 'useless' in the next few years as many countries would be switching over to non oil servicing automobiles .
4687 2018-11-07 15:38:18 Washington had three initiatives:

1634 a soda tax that the soda industry spent $20 MILLION on
1631 a carbon tax that big oil poured $32 MILLION into
1639 a gun control measure that the NRA barely spent a dime on

Guess which way they went?

MONEY BUYS VOTES. It's that simple.
4688 2018-11-07 15:38:16 It’s 12 cents. Since the 12 cents increase, gas prices have risen nearly a dollar statewide. That increase has nothing to do with the gas tax. That increase is the price of oil shooting up and fat cats getting rich off it.

4691 2018-11-07 15:38:07 It bothers me so much when people talk about how bad things are for oil patch workers right now so they want to make cuts to education and health care. Just throw teachers and nurses under the bus. Why don't our jobs matter just as much? Thank goodness for the NDP.

Or the time that one of the Saint Denis streetcars was derailed, killing two? OR, how about, the explosion at the oil refinery?

4698 2018-11-07 15:37:25 Oil by rail for export is 200,000 barrels per day.  The energy east pipeline capacity alone was proposed to be 1,100,000 bpd.  Line 3 - 760,000 bpd.  TMX - 590,000 bpd.  Of course we need to shut down pipelines first.  Best return on investment.

Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,   whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain  more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.
4709 2018-11-07 15:36:28 Time to short again? Even jawboning hasn't much of an impact on oil price anymore as market accepts and realizes spare capacity is here. Honestly expected more of a pop. With numbers this bad, expect further downside. #OOTT

4734 2018-11-07 15:33:08 US is a huge economy whose financial system dominates the globe. Oil is denominated in dollars. China is the only other country with similar size but its financial system isn’t as important. So no, other countries matter far less and are not headline news, for good reason.

4748 2018-11-07 15:32:22 Oil and gas companies are the largest investors of renewables.  But you can’t just turn off oil.  You’re naive and uneducated on this issue.  With all of the renewables we have, it still only accounts for 4% of total energy consumption.  All you’re asking for is to tax the poor.

4762 2018-11-07 15:31:41 Texas doesn’t have a state income tax, because oil pays enough taxes. That means the residents if the rest of the states pay for their state’s expenditures through gasoline purchases. But as long as Texans don’t have to pay a fair share, right?

4889 2018-11-07 15:18:15 Imagine the moral deceit of a person who willingly chooses money over the future of the earth, the people on it, and sadly their children. For what? A new car, a nice house? Politicians/lobbyists/oil company execs, when things get too bad to fix, you had better bought safe rooms.
4890 2018-11-07 15:18:09 What with a booming oil price ? , if they were going to fail they have done so at 30$ a barrel

4892 2018-11-07 15:18:01 We'll spin a tale about how he's always been against Big Oil and for the environment. Spitting is the pure essence of standing up for clean water, clean air and reversing climate change.

Because asbestos was seen as a wonder material, tens of thousands of workers were exposed to it on a daily basis.

4913 2018-11-07 15:16:25 Like I literally carry a lavender/peppermint oil with me at all times because it works so fckn well. Even keeping a peppermint candle in your room and letting it burn when you feel obe coming on helps.

4919 2018-11-07 15:16:03 Think about the oil vol index as you would think of the VIX. An explosion higher means higher demand of protection via options. This means the market is bearish oil, which translates into lower inflation expectations and yields.

4933 2018-11-07 15:14:42 I can’t help but feel Sarri isn’t getting the credit he deserves. To join one of the toughest leagues in the world and into a team in term oil, to be 16 games undefeated in all comps, including two games vs Liverpool, games vs united and arsenal, Special things happening in blue.
4934 2018-11-07 15:14:38 Not sure that's true. It's the Oil & Gas Authority that require a Hydraulic Fracture Plan as part of the well consenting process and have responsibility for managing the risk of induced seismicity...don't think OGA has the legal viaries to regulate geothermal?
4935 2018-11-07 15:14:27 Also, oil companies aren't really known for their people/community skills. I know they are better now, but they may well have their fingers crossed... Though, from what I have seen, the software industry is no better.

He's wrong because he neglected to specify his interest to politicians. What about yourself? Have you neglected to let politicians know what

4947 2018-11-07 15:12:56 Twitter’s “request a developer key” workflow is like something out of a information hellscape where thousands of bots and agents spread disinformation to advance the views of a few oil authoritarians.

4953 2018-11-07 15:12:14 I mean I knew that anyway, but, y'know... The oil industry has not been dying for most of the time I've been in it, but the cyclicity seems to mean there is a reasonable supply of people to replace you with and also, of course, you are ridiculously well paid in the first place.

If you want to dig deeper as to "why" you need to take a HARD look at Chris Nowinski, leader of the "CTE hysteria" movement. He  is a profiteering snake oil salesman, and former WWE wrestler taught by the best, Vince McMahon

4966 2018-11-07 15:11:20 I read this "dodo" tweet and oil entered my eyes. 

4967 2018-11-07 15:11:16 While rising energy prices have bolstered earnings at major oil companies, the recent dip could come as a relief for consumers bracing for higher prices at the pump. It also could ease pressure on airlines and shipping companies that are spending more on fuel.

4970 2018-11-07 15:10:43 Honest question, not to diminish this but was CBD oil not legal there? Same benefits sans THC effects.
4971 2018-11-07 15:10:42 LMFAOOO i’m getting an oil change and the guy got in my car and was like “oh shit” bc my seat was so far up  leave me alone i’m little

4975 2018-11-07 15:10:07 Remember, though, that 60M from parts of the oil and gas industry bought a LOT of direct, negative advertising in all 3 states.
4976 2018-11-07 15:10:06 I actually had this idea the other day; that you must be able to make a good aioli with olive oil. But perhaps I was wrong.

4983 2018-11-07 15:09:15 So that I totally understand. My concern is more for the carbon footprint. Excess energy that’s hard to transfer or a capture used for mining is great, but if that energy is coming from coal or oil, it’s still increasing the overall carbon footprint no?
4984 2018-11-07 15:08:52 You are missing the point, I dont have  problem with EU citizens coming here to work just I have worked all over Europe for many years in oil industry. I own a modest small engineering company but cannot expand and employ more staff due to the shackles of EU . Remainers are naive
4985 2018-11-07 15:08:50 you should try using an oil diffuser to help you sleep. It does wonders I promise haha

4987 2018-11-07 15:08:37 So you make a Cheese sandwich but you put the butter on the outside not the in and you put that in the frying pan and cook it on a medium heat
the cheese goes all gooey  and the bread gets hard and golden - No oil in the pan
4988 2018-11-07 15:08:31 Prop 127 is a no, welp I can't help but feel bad and wonder how many Navajos fell for the propaganda against it. Some people here think coal and oil are going to make a big comeback I guess.

Well here it is cousins, its never coming back.
4989 2018-11-07 15:08:26 No surprises. Voters like the idea of "climate action" so long as the other guy (aka Big Oil/Biz) picks up the tab.
4990 2018-11-07 15:08:21 It's akin to our delusional resolve to keep importing petroleum products... We also lose, bye products of crude oil refining; petrochemicals...
4991 2018-11-07 15:08:21 My first voyage to London in about 12 years to not watch cricket. I’ve already seen one sight on the train. The Kia Oval oil things.

5020 2018-11-07 15:05:34 We need to auction some mining rights to highest bidders who offer to pay highest tax. That's how Norway deals with oil & gas drilling rights. Companies there pau as much as 78% tax and still make money. This avoids undervaluation of our resources, a perennial problem.
5021 2018-11-07 15:05:23 It’s because i practically drink castor oil
5022 2018-11-07 15:05:21 i can't wait for their precious oil money to run out and leave them with no choice but to modernize beyond the 1950s
5023 2018-11-07 15:05:21 I'm really hoping it's a @MoonPie sponsorship. The free "Eleven" moonpies at the doors of Lucas Oil Stadium would be a great promotion.
5024 2018-11-07 15:05:09 But i pakai minyak rambut, rasa macam tak clean kalau wash pakai air je? I mean minyak like argan oil.

5029 2018-11-07 15:04:30 Oil is the soul of your car’s motor. It keeps every one of its parts moving easily, assimilates overabundance warm, and contains added substances. CESC Liqui Moly offers you the best motor oil town. Call James on 08120520593

5040 2018-11-07 15:03:41 Don’t put tea tree oil directly on the skin because it’s too volatile. You can use tea tree if it’s mixed with carrier oils like grape seed or safflower 
Witch hazel is a really strong toner esp if you don’t have very oily skin. Is it alcohol free?& What’s your skin type?
5041 2018-11-07 15:03:38 So Monday i went in for a oil change and to get my recall serviced . So i dropped my car off and proceeded to walk around the lot . I walked around the car lot for 2 hours and nobody not once said anything to me. employees stood off to the sides and smoked cigarettes.

5043 2018-11-07 15:03:28 Lucky! We had a big fight just to allow CBD oil here because our legislature is in the pocket of Eli Lily.
5044 2018-11-07 15:03:25 Keep in mind China both got waivers for some Iran oil and publicly pushed companies without waivers to honor sanctions. China made this switch of statements about the sanctions just last week. I don't think Trump would give out waivers if they weren't leading into a deal.

5056 2018-11-07 15:02:25 I missed the connection between a soldier murdering for oil and a Dr curing disease. Which Drs don't really do it's more researchers and lab techs that do that now
5057 2018-11-07 15:02:22 Renewable energy in Australia has not been as successful as they predicted. Also very expensive, not to mention fracking inevitably is bringing costs of oil down and less dependent on Middle East blood oil.

5063 2018-11-07 15:01:56 I get so upset when I read something about coconut oil. I bought a huge tub a few years ago because of the hype and I broke out like a motherfucker! Fuck!
5064 2018-11-07 15:01:46 My local frustration was the failure of Initiative 1631, due almost entirely to incredibly misleading ads run by Big Oil, and people who bought their BS.  We had a real chance to help save the environment, and we blew it.

5087 2018-11-07 15:00:21 I have never understood why people buy a home in the middle of a oil and gas field and then bitch about drilling and development around their home. Don’t buy a home in middle of oil and gas field if you don’t like drilling.
5088 2018-11-07 15:00:19 Per the Denver Post: 

KC Becker [supporter of prop 112] told me last night: “I want put the oil and gas wars to bed. I think we’re going to find solutions that will make communities feel safer in their homes without putting oil and gas out of business.”

5092 2018-11-07 14:59:51 Present. I was truly rooting for Beto. Not a Texan but a neighbor. He would have done great things for TX. Most of our races in NM turned out the way I wanted. We have a Dem governor again. Saddened that Xochtl Torrez Small lost to a big oil insider for house seat.
5093 2018-11-07 14:59:50 see u guys are the real mvp our maccas is idk what oil but havent ate in forever
5094 2018-11-07 14:59:49 We have enough sunshine in this state to power nearly everything. Renewable energy is a bigger job maker than dirty oil. But money talks I guess.
5095 2018-11-07 14:59:46 HAHH wait what oil do they use
5096 2018-11-07 14:59:43 there's castor oil and all these different plant extracts so that might explain the smell
5097 2018-11-07 14:59:42 I wasn’t aware of the olive oil fraud until I saw you posting about it, and I only came upon you through the “manosphere” here on twitter.

5106 2018-11-07 14:58:42 Agree to a point,but 75% of that was already on the docket, regardless of who won the election. @HillaryClinton would have taken credit as well.  As for energy independence, we're still using Saudi oil, manufacturing jobs with NO possible retraining options when coal is obsolete.

5108 2018-11-07 14:58:32 Good for Nevada ! My state just passed Amendment 9 banning offshore oil and gas drilling.
5109 2018-11-07 14:58:18 Well I've heard reports that some of that is natural seepage because of the all the oil deposits close to the surface of the ocean floor how do you reflect that in your story?
5110 2018-11-07 14:58:10 A flat light today so a good opportunity to grab some photos of three of my active paintings, Now like myself oil paintings don't always like having their picture taken light reflection etc confuses the camera that does not see or adjust as the eye does, All ok today though :)
5111 2018-11-07 14:58:07 Brad Wall got SK back on the rails.

I have a family member whom is an oil executive/investor and he deals globally. Alberta is flagged, no go!
5112 2018-11-07 14:58:07 Exactly. It smells that such a high % of Florida voters passed #4 restoring voting rights but elected DeRacist, who was losing until the very end. Same w/ Scott...while voting to prevent oil drilling off our coasts? Very strange.

Thank you!! I’m pleased about our new house and gov
5119 2018-11-07 14:57:23 Well seeing as how 112 didn't pass this is a moot point. And I'd like to figure out alternative to oil and gas because those are finite resources that will run out one day. And 22 years notice for the Polis plan is more than enough time to transition
5120 2018-11-07 14:57:19 Hydrating is for dehydrated skin and moisture is for dry/Normal skin. For me sometimes my tzone get dehydrated due me sometimes not drinking enough or over using scrubs. Moisturizer is best used everyday to keep a healthy balance of of water/oil on your skin.

5125 2018-11-07 14:57:04 You could try castor oil instead! Works really well, is less expensive than Latisse, and probably safer than this alternative??
5126 2018-11-07 14:56:54 Sa panaginip walang fare hike at oil price hike
5127 2018-11-07 14:56:52 Yes, that's got to be a big part of it. People emboldened to rubbish veganism or low carb safely knowing that most doctors wouldn't recommend them. I'm looking forward to sugar and veg oil being treated like tobacco.

5140 2018-11-07 14:55:19 Agreed. These people don't want to assimilate they want our land because it's rich in resources. You can't grow anything in sand, the only thing they had going for them was oil and that runs out after a while. They slaughter animals alive for their gods so there goes their meat.

5149 2018-11-07 14:54:15 You are a very superficial person, focusing on Michelle Obama's posture and Hilary Clinton's weight.  You are no oil painting yourself, and those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. And the results of the voting showed that decent people weren't impressed with you either
5150 2018-11-07 14:54:14 Really? So big oil is evil and should be taxed for excavating and producing gas and oil we all need for our day to day lives? Don’t get me wrong. I believe we need to do something about pollution but it’s with technological breakthroughs. Not pointing and calling big oil evil.

5154 2018-11-07 14:53:55 In 1973, the Scottish Stock Exchange was merged into London Stock Exchange ...after Scottish OIL was discovered.  In 2016 Scotland voted to remain in EU, and a group of ex-NASDAQ traders, Scottish investors planned to re-open it in Edinburgh.

5156 2018-11-07 14:53:27 Give me one generation and I will transform the whole world”. Seems like these words from Vladimir Lenin are coming true. Dems overtook all aspects of our life. I live in dem PA and people here are BLiND. They can’t see that they pay for oil drillers tax at the gas pump, also

5165 2018-11-07 14:52:07 Depends on what kind of job you do. Take away tech and entertainment and CA is a farming state with seaports. Heavy industry, oil and other diversified industry left long ago. Even biotech mfg moved out.
5166 2018-11-07 14:52:05 OIL 15M volatility just now ON, waving up. I'm hoping for the kick higher here, did not see this coming... I'm committed. Can go either way here of course. WATCH UWT
5167 2018-11-07 14:51:59 Thank you for not taking care of the city and for taking big oil money.  Karma's a mean mean thing man.
5168 2018-11-07 14:51:47 PDP has urged NLC not to accept N30,000 minimum wage. Today, oil price in $71 per barrel.

Minimum wage under PDP was N18,000 even when oil price was $120 with no investment in infrastructure, agriculture and zero saving.

5180 2018-11-07 14:50:11 Also a lot more people will now have access to cheaper healthcare due to the medicaid expansion,  offshore oil drilling is banned in Florida, and iirc fracking is banned in Colorado

5182 2018-11-07 14:50:01 Thats hella lame bro. Now i cant vape inside my job just cus i also dont wanna support offshore oil drilling smh they arent even related at all it should at least be additive to each other if they do it that way
5183 2018-11-07 14:49:32 Apparently, "OIL ROTTS THE BRAIN"
5184 2018-11-07 14:49:30 So they issued oil bonds worth Rs.155000 cr which this govt is paying or will pay.

5187 2018-11-07 14:49:12 You're right! Venezuela is a great example that if you're progressive and dependent on oil exports, the US will flood the global economy with cheap oil with the help of Saudi Arabia, annihilating your own economy and destabilizing your country.

5196 2018-11-07 14:48:43 Lol so true. It would be helpful for some folks tho cuz the way the got these amendments grouped  like how you gonna have an amendment about oil drilling and indoor vaping under the same shit. That’s how shit gets missed

5201 2018-11-07 14:48:16 This is the Catch-22 with trying to engage people in the process. They don't understand how it works. Part of organizing is an educational component. Unfortunately that gets harder when you have grifters on our "side" like Bernie and Avenatti selling snake oil. 1/2

5214 2018-11-07 14:47:10 If, by "eco-terrorists" you mean the "leave it in the ground" bunch, fair enough. If we don't get oil to tide water, the end user will find it elsewhere. As long as we use oil, it will also force us to buy at rates set by others. We need to be a player, not on the sidelines

5219 2018-11-07 14:46:51 Certainly on both, but I think that it's a positive sign that more people endorsed 1631, overcoming tens of millions in oil $$, than the much more conservative approach in 2016's 732. 

Expect to see some revamped NE 2019 pushes as well for carbon taxes

5257 2018-11-07 14:41:44 14 year long oil spill and it's still spilling to this day in the gulf.  Republicans want to keep offshore drilling so that our new generation mutated humans can be miserable.  Taylor energy Corp. Spilled oil for 14 years plus. Hold them accountable! This is our only planet
5258 2018-11-07 14:41:42 Ally. Sure. Support for them in the Yom Kippur War is why the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo was leveled against the US. It crippled our economy and manufacturing sector. And, really, we never fully recovered from it. That was the point in time wages began to stagnate.
5259 2018-11-07 14:41:39 I'd bet two coats of that is all you'd need for several years.  Looks similar to what we use on our barns.  It's a water/oil mix and the oil should help seal the wood.

5279 2018-11-07 14:40:00 The UK's livestock production is responsible for just 5% of our carbon emissions.

5285 2018-11-07 14:39:30 My dad was already there—oil field engineer (the kind that works hard), he knew. I have watched my adult sons come to the correct understanding. I live in a place where very few ppl are concerned for “carbon signature” though, it is like the 1970s.

5297 2018-11-07 14:38:34 Why not pay for oil changes half the time it’s cheaper than doing it yourself
5298 2018-11-07 14:37:52 We tend to overstate #Iran's economic dependency on #oil. Let's look at exports (barrels per day) on a per capita basis (per 1000 people) using 2017 data:

 285.5
 265.3 
 220.8
 35.4
 16.5

5404 2018-11-07 14:28:22 You do realize that this was a pathetic mid-term gain for the Dems, who threw oil tankers full of money just to eke out a narrow majority? They are not in a good position for '20.

thank you
5432 2018-11-07 14:25:50 UK doctors can now prescribe cannabis oil. There's good evidence that it can help with chronic pain. You'd think, then, that my GP could prescribe it. To be fair, my GP probably would if he could, but this is going to be an uphill battle. And who knows whether it will even work?
5433 2018-11-07 14:25:45 I have the oil..dm me
5434 2018-11-07 14:25:44 Instead of wasting time in West Virginia against a guy who voted with him, Trump should have been in Nevada trying to save Heller and Michigan supporting James.
5435 2018-11-07 14:25:33 coloradans, why did we vote "No" in proposition 112 to set back oil and gas development? why do we want fracking right besides our homes, water sources and schools?
5436 2018-11-07 14:25:24 you put the necklace on a flat surface and then put baby oil on it and wait for the knots to loosen up by themselves then just open them with your nail or a cotton swap
5437 2018-11-07 14:25:19 I went overboard with the oil on my face this morning
5438 2018-11-07 14:25:12 Whatever the Colorado voters are smokin', keep on smokin' it! Rejecting limitations on fracking would mean more oil from us, the U.S. of A.!

5446 2018-11-07 14:24:46 Where did they spend it?  Are we supposed to believe the media is unbiased when they gain so much cash from our hatred and discord?
5447 2018-11-07 14:24:46 Hydrating doesn’t mean it’s bad for oily skin babe! Weird as it is , it helps with keeping your skin less oily cos when your skin is hydrated they produce less oil. 
Exfoliating toner maybe can go for Pixi. But only if your skin is used to Aha/bha, takut skin barrier rosak
5448 2018-11-07 14:24:39 this person has to raise her right hand and swear to DEFEND the constitution of the USA!   which is in direct conflict of her Sharia law beliefs. she should then be immediately disqualified.
5449 2018-11-07 14:24:31 Why, you some oil?
5450 2018-11-07 14:24:19 He's wrong because he neglected to specify his interest to politicians. What about yourself.  Remember the squeaky wheel get's the oil.  For me elections are like football huddles. It's what happens after the election that counts. We have to do our part.
5451 2018-11-07 14:24:15 Given that it’s oil based I think the coverstain does seal. I have a fabulous independent paint store and they are all about coverstain even though it’s not a specialty product.
5452 2018-11-07 14:24:12 Glass jars of Coconut oil are kinda hazardous. When one gets dropped there ends up being glass everywhere covered in a clear oil that makes it very hard to spot. Anyway, got out of it with only one tiny shard in my foot. Second time I've seen this happen though. Bye!
5453 2018-11-07 14:24:05 Richard you cannot be serious about this and at the same time announcing plans for a new runway at Dublin airport and giving offshore drilling licenses for oil and gas.  It makes no #climate or #environmental sense.

Go figure. Maybe we should invade Venezuela, take it; then GIVE it to Democrats. It’s oil rich! ReLo!

5466 2018-11-07 14:22:40 Iran sits on rich resources. From gas and oil to minerals. So why not? And in Iran, people barely get married and have children. So it’s the most basic right you wanna take that away from them?!!
5467 2018-11-07 14:22:38 Yeah you and me both but like drugs weening yourself off of them is the worst way to get off of them we have enough oil and gas already extracted and stock piled to get us to 100% renewable energy
5468 2018-11-07 14:22:38 @MoghaluKingsley is coming to create a concrete economic

5491 2018-11-07 14:20:22 How can a parent a) kill their own child, b) dump them so callously in crude oil.  All this because he’s got another woman and racked up a load of debt, unecessary loss on innocent lives!
5492 2018-11-07 14:20:07 George, the number one lesson to learn is this ..... Independence for Croatia facilitated this great standard of living, and they have no oil or gas .... just think what a prosperous country an Independant Scotland would be ! ! .... thanks for the heads up George.

5568 2018-11-07 14:13:20 I've had some people ask me what the election jeans for #oil.  The real question is what does it mean for the #USMCA.  Oil should be unaffected

5571 2018-11-07 14:13:09 Pelosi pretty much funded Lizzie against Culberson for her win in Tx7. Even though in her ads she ran she professes no loyalty, pro oil etc... 100% you are correct, she WILL vote for Pelosi.

This is very simple:  Its the United STATES of America, not the United  PEOPLE of America.  Go read some history about the Great Compromise and stop looking down your nose at other states.

5600 2018-11-07 14:10:21 They have exactly the same type of fat. 80% to 90% of the fat is the so called “oleic acid” which is present in both. I tend to choose olive oil because of the taste. There may exists some differences in terms of minerals one vs the other, but fat-wise it is the same pretty much.

5612 2018-11-07 14:09:07 Ha!  Trump once again turns to threats and intimidation.

NOW let’s have a look at Trump’s tax returns...

5615 2018-11-07 14:09:02 To not too. Apologies. There is a growing business on the 'other side'. Academia has serious career investments. The European Wind Power industry is huge. Politicians trade on being green as do car makers (a bit of a joke). But I agree, oil and coal are a huge opposition.
5616 2018-11-07 14:09:02 Also high oil prices are really pinching personal disposable income. It was onions that once caused the downfall of Madan Lal Khurana. #Karnataka #KarnatakaBypolls

5628 2018-11-07 14:07:53 PDP has urged NLC not to accept N30,000 minimum wage. Today, oil price in $71 per barrel.

Minimum wage under PDP was N18,000 even when oil price was $120 with no investment in infrastructure, agriculture and zero saving.
5629 2018-11-07 14:07:41 Also, I hope they try. It won't work and will be hilarious and cost them political capital and destroy their morale.
5630 2018-11-07 14:07:39 At the dentist having someone drill into my face.

5631 2018-11-07 14:07:33 I’ve tried vapor rub, I’ll have to look into Olbus oil

5643 2018-11-07 14:06:44 Please do! It is all biochemistry, because temperature (and even light) degrades easily the fat in olive oil. That’s even the reason olive oil comes in a dark bottle to protect against that; it is light sensitive and it is “cold” pressed to protect the fat upon extraction

5662 2018-11-07 14:04:28 It’s nice to see we’re all going back to the days of Obama. The tax cuts need to be repealed. Regulations on big businesses needs to to put back. And the epa needs to be made stronger, ANWAR needs to be shut down to all oil exploration. the health care for all needs to happen
5663 2018-11-07 14:04:27 I know, I've read the article. In the article George repeats the assertion the Chinese are not to blame for their industrial pollution as we buy the goods they produce. Are we also to blame for their stock piling of fossil fuel? namely oil.

5666 2018-11-07 14:04:12 Yup. I mean, honestly?
It is a natural plant with a plethora of uses aside from recreational. It is a significant threat to big pharma, big oil, and the Cabal as a *resource*. The fact they are pushing it as panacea for the masses as a *high* shows their true intent.  Drug people

5675 2018-11-07 14:03:42 Yeah... People like to do things the way they used to do. The oil community is conservative & slow, you can easily compare the median age in say, Exxon, to that at Google and that may also be part of the reason.

Without the sovereignty,
how can I enable freedom?

5712 2018-11-07 14:00:26 Yeh he probably needs a oil soaked Arab country a free stadium and so much money that accusations of alleged corruption manage to turn a second division side into premier winners...now I wonder who does that 
5713 2018-11-07 14:00:21 Doesn't make sense for the fossil fuel companies.  The oil barons will just pocket the money.

5716 2018-11-07 14:00:04 I got the kids ready and out of the house in time for me to get an oil change, drop the kids off and get to work on time. This feels like I won the day already
5717 2018-11-07 14:00:03 It's why we always emphasize fresh #EVOO.  Who wants their olive oil on display in an archeological museum as a relic and their legacy, but it probably has a good minerality.  #evoo, #oliveoil, #freshisbest

5723 2018-11-07 13:59:26 Operating profits for ADM's oilseeds business more than tripled to $349 million in 3rd quarter.   Hmmmm, what a great strategy. Tell farmers it sucks and its all China and we have their worse basis ever and buy the crap out soybeans and sell the sh-t out meal/oil look at exports
5724 2018-11-07 13:59:24 im a little agitated I spilled 50% of my essential oil on the floor
5725 2018-11-07 13:59:09 Economic variables for SA after US mid-term elections include dollar, US interest rates, international oil price/weaker dollar, stronger rand/markets now need 2 monitor Fed's monetary policy & US-China trade battle/US Democrats control HoR but can they shift the economic needle?

5727 2018-11-07 13:58:40 use dr. bronners tea tree oil castile soap. you can find it at walmart or ulta. just have to find which locations around you have it. and dilute it with some water. it cleared up all of my dark spots and stopped me from getting break outs. even after I stopped using it.

5737 2018-11-07 13:57:08 really not sure how i was living daily life without cbd oil
5738 2018-11-07 13:56:58 I was proposing that economies could grow in a virtual environment rather than AI as an agent to grow existing economies, which is likely to an extent; but typically will favour the few. Also tech got is into this situation, so will need to evolve to get us out. End of oil fuel?
5739 2018-11-07 13:56:43 The devil is in the details.
No one owes the citizens the right to know the effect on our fiscal plans. DMO will fix the hole. Oil will come from Niger Delta. CBN will print more money and Nigerians will forget about the episode. 

Seriously, our country is a joke.

5743 2018-11-07 13:56:20 It's kind of funny that he's already freaking out that we now have "checks and balances" back in place. He's going to find out that no amount of snake oil he tries to sell is going to save him from being held accountable.
5744 2018-11-07 13:56:11 Rosehip oil has changed my life...& im really mad at yall for not telling me sooner.
5745 2018-11-07 13:55:59 Hope I don’t miss Durag day bruh they better hurry up and get my oil change and tires rotated so I can zoom zoom out here
5746 2018-11-07 13:55:57 Sigh. The NRA/Big Oil funded candidate won in my California district, just. She's been running lying attack ads and/or ads claiming the tax cut for the wealthy is a "middle class tax cut"  constantly for months; I got one every single time I looked at a YouTube video.
5747 2018-11-07 13:55:47 The things using the energy is not the issue; it's the things producing the energy. If we really wanted, we could have more clean energy than we could ever imagine using. But clean energy means less money for people in coal, oil, etc. so...

Carbon tax? I hate taxes but.. idk..
5748 2018-11-07 13:55:38 Now the Americans election is over !

Things are pretty interesting including #oil and its politics will reserfce again !!!
5749 2018-11-07 13:55:25 Our oil will be refined abroad!!! What happened to the Changamwe oil refinery!?
5750 2018-11-07 13:55:18 Sure there will be a compromise, but the oil counties are all republican so not much reason for dems to compromise. they're happy to screw the R counties

5755 2018-11-07 13:54:28 100%. Look at how it's turned oil rich Oklahoma into a state that has four day school weeks because they're unable to get the supermajority needed to raise revenues.
5756 2018-11-07 13:54:27 I started off the day by unintentionally dousing the kitchen with vegetable oil and I've been on slippery ground ever since.

5763 2018-11-07 13:53:47 You should have seen the insane amount of money poured into "No on Measure G" here in San Luis Obispo county, California by Chevron, Shell, and other oil companies.

Nearly every TV/YT commercial break had an ad, everyday in the mail had an ad, billboards & signs, etc.
5764 2018-11-07 13:53:43 TESCO, MORRISONS and ASDA. 

Now followed SAINSBURYS by cutting petrol prices
by 2p a litre.

A pathetic 2p off.
Based on the 15% drop in oil prices and a strengthening
£ it should be at least 5p cheaper. 
Where’s the protest from lndustrial,Commercial and
Private fuel users.
5765 2018-11-07 13:53:34 I agree that they shouldn't have been on the same amendment. 
However, I get really bad migraines around that stuff and I don't like offshore oil drilling...
It worked out for me specifically, and I still had a hard time voting on that because they shouldn't be on the same thing

5782 2018-11-07 13:51:39 I'm pissed and disgusted that prop 112 has failed. All the oil company fear mongering worked. Always good to see profits put above all else

5785 2018-11-07 13:51:22 Also some mistakes people generally do when cooking: always use butter or lard, never olive oil. This is because olive oil can easy be degraded caused by the high temperature; butter is super strong and resilient to that. Only use olive oil to spread on salads.
5786 2018-11-07 13:51:09 Coconut oil and almond oil at night everyday could help

5810 2018-11-07 13:48:34 I kind of thought those cool words after yesterday's election were too c oil to be true. F**k your divisive agenda.

5819 2018-11-07 13:47:54 Because of what it means when the boom goes away. That’s peoples children who don’t eat. Oil money been feeding me most my life and when it isn’t running right it hurts. Big city voters have a hard time wrapping their mind around that. Again it’s ok. Just can’t talk down.
5820 2018-11-07 13:47:52 Non stop or 1 stop. It will always be an extra stop if a divert is needed. Safety. An oil leak? I'd rather be in VIE than in the air. 

If there are customer service issues, then focus on that. Pax - not you!

5844 2018-11-07 13:44:39 I was born and raised in FL. It is ALL about the racism. When they’re gargling oil- and red tide- tainted ocean water, they’ll still be clinging to how they stuck it to the Black guy.
5845 2018-11-07 13:44:38 Why would a Green voter vote for the Dems when they have such bad environmental credentials. You want those Green votes, promise to outlaw fracking and subsidise solar instead oil.
5846 2018-11-07 13:44:38 Not talking about either sanitation or oil: but about representation of the people. Thanks for the false syllogism though
5847 2018-11-07 13:44:37 I fear for FL's beautiful natural resources now.  Big Sugar unchecked, oil rig approval looming, the call for more roads versus trains and other transit equals a cesspool of pollution.

5851 2018-11-07 13:44:04 I love the way they always bring up states like Wyoming but never smaller populated blue states. They are fine with those states having two votes but God forbid a conservative state have the same
5852 2018-11-07 13:43:59 With Crude oil $WTIC completely beaten down at strong support zone with "oversold" conditions and sentiment very bearish, it might be time to nimble on some stocks in the sector for a quick trade.
5853 2018-11-07 13:43:55 Education funding fails and protecting our beautiful state from greedy oil companies fails. Says a lot about what is prioritized these days. Jobs over education and environmental protection.  such myopic viewpoints.

5869 2018-11-07 13:42:30 And tourism - if someone ruined our beaches with an oil spill? I’d say it’s more about “don’t mess up my beautiful vacation home” than “I care about the ecosystem of the barrier islands”. But maybe that’s an Upstate mentality? Our relationship with the coast is vacay-oriented.

And it is used in place of moisturizer, I think based on your guide? What is the benefit of face oil over moisturizer?

5890 2018-11-07 13:40:43 Tergantung oilnya kak. Tiap oil kan beda2 cara penggunaannya ada yg dipake topical, aromatic, atau oral. Beberapa oil bisa dikonsumsi langsung, kaya peppermint, thieves, lemon, copaiba. Buat awal2 diencerin boleh, kalo berani langsung tetes bawah lidah.
5891 2018-11-07 13:40:37 US's easing of sanctions, be it for Iranian oil, Chabahar port development, Russian Triumf purchase coupled with Japan's currency swap agreement are all pointing to one thing..World needs another 5 years of BJP govt and Allies are doing their best to stabilise things before 2019

5924 2018-11-07 13:36:43 The House Republicans need to burn the midnight oil until high noon on Jan 3rd and pass as much legislation as they can. Hard to believe they'll start prioritizing their constituents interest at this point, but it sure would be nice for a change.

5935 2018-11-07 13:35:30 So according to some facts I made new targets. Oil cuts are necessary, so establishing this year #OPEC goals needs our attention as year 2019 may not start with GDP growths. My S&P target now came below 2609 in next month or at the beginning of the year, the rest follows.

6000 2018-11-07 13:30:15 Oh yes, agreed. I misunderstood your point. 

What I found extremely interesting in this study is the effect of olive oil. Granted, overconsumption will always lead to bad health but I didn't expect it to be worse than palm oil!
6001 2018-11-07 13:30:12 Will u also let everyone know about the oil waivers you gave to various countries so they may continue buying oil from Iran? Very weak sanctions you have imposed!!

6207 2018-11-07 13:07:20 The price of oil went way down in 2014-2015 is because of this lift on our exports and they tried to keep us out of the oil game and it didn’t work - it hurt us a lil but now we are back to drilling at the same pace as we did when oil was at $110. They just started back up at $65
6208 2018-11-07 13:07:15 That's a bit weird. Oops I need my oil changed.

6225 2018-11-07 13:05:43 in addition to this corporate taxes in norway exceed 80% for the oil industry, which forms a large chunk of norway's gdp and this is why the revenue from corporate taxes in norway is so high

6230 2018-11-07 13:05:16 Bro they can’t if they wanted to, the US lifted the ban on exporting oil - so now we are flooding the market due to us being able to sell oil now, if they do ramo up to hurt us, they will hurt worse bc our cost for producing oil is about $35 a barrel OPECS is around $70-80

6264 2018-11-07 13:01:49 Just to stress, plastic and palm oil free are possible, but it's work, a challenge and one that takes effort. The sad reality is that a significant proportion of the population, while willfully ignorant of the issues, are not inclined to put in the effort to make such changes.
6265 2018-11-07 13:01:33 It is the transplants. Once again the collapse of coal and the rise of oil and gas is to blame. God only matters to people around here in the form of money, not nature. I hate those people with a passion.

6464 2018-11-07 12:38:12 When oil prices soared instead of using that opportunity to promote public transport and curb pvt use, you presented a pic of burning pockets. When prices are dropping u could have asked for more cess . Like cleanathon u cud have a stop pvt transport. Hypocritic.

6512 2018-11-07 12:31:24 Talk that OPEC may consider re-introducing output caps in 2019 at the weekend meeting in Abu Dhabi this weekend seems premature, but it's spurring a short-covering bounce in oil after 7-month low was seen yesterday and 4-year high last month. And what happens when US waivers end?
6513 2018-11-07 12:31:20 Cruz based his campaign on fear. Murderous illegal immigrants, taking your guns away, socialist communism, taking your oil jobs away.

6572 2018-11-07 12:23:06 Still haven't sold the remaining 75% of my $ISM stash (blended aep at 3.65). Profit taking might happen tom but my bias is that the oil drill news will push this up later on. ATH of 7.2 levels is within range but I am a student of the market so I will adjust accgly tomorrow.
6573 2018-11-07 12:22:53 @mrjamesob very impressed with the food shops you frequent. In the last 2 weeks, I’ve heard you reference the Chelsea Fishmonger & just now Hammonds!

6582 2018-11-07 12:21:39 It's quite interesting to see that Canadians since the late 80' have been buying smaller cars to face the oil's raising prices and that frenchies meanwhile started buying bigger cars....that says a lot on the similarities that exist between "Small Town. USA" and france
6583 2018-11-07 12:21:37 EDL's inability to replenish our fuel tanks and resume electricity production 
would make two groups happier 1) Importers of fuel oil (mazout) who are feeding streets and private generators  2) Operators of street generators selling electricity cash and tax free

I believe you misunderstood some vape heads. When a vape douche is telling you oil rigs are bad, they are referring to a marijuana smoking device not an actual oil rig. 
6678 2018-11-07 12:10:46 Data suggests marijuana use as a factor in fatal auto accidents is, in fact, increasing Sir.

Defenders of marijuana say we're better off with it than with opioids and SSRI drugs, but they want to do this card-Monte switch between smoking weed and using cannabis oil.

6699 2018-11-07 12:09:03 Yup, sometimes just taking the cap off and giving it a good sniff is enough to do the job! I love to put a little behind my neck or ears, the soles of my feet and on my chest - great way to get all the benefits. Can be mixed with a little coconut oil to protect the skin! :)

6704 2018-11-07 12:08:35 Iran said on Tuesday it had so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs despite U.S. pressure, but it urged European countries opposed to U.S. sanctions to do more to shield Iran, as Russia and Turkey also voiced their objections.
6705 2018-11-07 12:08:30 I learned neglect was best. I was using this oil thing, but they don't make it anymore. Also,  it is really humid here, so I braid it all the time. It's super long like that too. I haven't worn it down in about a year

I mean I understand why Florida has so much trouble counting votes with people having seizures in the voting booths, but not the amendments.
6981 2018-11-07 11:29:21 the corrupt, murderous, socialist rat continues deceiving the people, with its inventions of coins, and disguising the economic failures, today it is a country without production, traffic, energy, oil.
6982 2018-11-07 11:28:49 I hope your stand has an [oil/petrol pre-mix] Reservoir Dogs theme and the curator's name is Hans. He needs to be flatulent.
6983 2018-11-07 11:28:49 My ex once call me out on facebook and it became a thread for all friends on our list, some of our clients mostly (Oil & Gas) sent me mail directly to resolve the issue promptly else we risk losing their patronage. I did in no time and unfriended all. Some girls can be crazy.

6987 2018-11-07 11:28:23 @JoeSquawk Basically all of crude will be delivered to the global market and  delivered to individual countries from there...… if one country stops buying from us the oil will go somewhere else.... The demand is still there

7004 2018-11-07 11:25:23 I’m sorry you’re so bitter Josh.  Reality is you tried to sell the snake AND the snake oil but you failed.  Hugin has his own liberal platform to blame.  I can’t thank my team enough—truly honorable!  We stood in Truth, Life, real Republican values & our conscience is clear.

7014 2018-11-07 11:23:29 Coconut oil is widely available & will varies in price. My most trusted brand is Parachute (blue bottle) K75  500ml Jubilee Chemist. Food Lovers sell by bucket but pricey. Tea oil by Chisamba Farms is carried by Shoprite. Less than K20 for small bottle.
7015 2018-11-07 11:23:27 I never understood this argument, the rural areas consistently vote against their own interests, on issues involving the environment, federal aid, jobs, healthcare etc. They are voting for old white wallstreet and oil tycoon men that see them as votes and literally nothing else.

UPA had imported oil from Iran for few yrs during sanctions, but that was because they used Euro to make payments. This time around, both US and Europe are imposing sanctions. (1/n)

So you believe the resurgence of UAE, the riches of Qatar,Saudi Arabia, Jordan e.t.c are based more on religious doctrine than..
1. Sound economic principle and implementing a solid vision.
2. Large amount of crude oil and strong partnership with America and the West?

Coming off anti-depressants can be very tricky, best to withdraw very slowly gradually reducing the dose, and there's no shame in staying on them if they are needed. It's taken well over a year to reduce mine and still not fully off them yet.

Simply placing more #value on human resources will improve #productivity and yield greater returns from little resources. 

#Nigeria will remain in its state, despite our rich resources (as oil). #Corruption thrives where there are poor values.

7435 2018-11-07 10:19:12 So divided like oil and water. No prospects of ever pulling in one direction unless there is true new dispensation which excludes existing political parties.
7436 2018-11-07 10:19:06 You understand that the resources will be extracted and burnt by these oil companies whether the state profits from that or not? What we are doing right now effectively is subsidising the industry, where we could be taking a 70% cut and ploughing that into carbon neutral economy
7437 2018-11-07 10:19:06 Hi Cheryl, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

7460 2018-11-07 10:15:37 In the Big 4 agenda, manufacturing is one of them, in fact they describe it well as value addition. Of what essence should we allow Tullow oil to ship out our crude oil to be refined elsewhere outside the country?? That equals shipping out jobs.... my opinion.
7461 2018-11-07 10:15:36 Come on Kellogs. Do your brand image a favour and stop using cheap palm oil - or indeed any palm oil. Score points for the environment, make people love you, stop being a corporate arse. #PalmOil #kellogs
7462 2018-11-07 10:15:22 Never wash it. When you are done cooking, rub it clean with a dry cloth then rub it with a virgin oil that burns at a high temperature, put a cup of salt in it and rub the salt around until it coats the pan. Discard the salt, rub the pan clean. Store dry and covered, dont stack

7510 2018-11-07 10:07:28 Well how do we define natural? Because most people, and most Native Americans, would say that the Native American people were living "natural" lives from a European point of view. Maybe knives/blades aren't natural because humans shape them, but crude oil is because it's organic

7831 2018-11-07 09:13:59 well, provided our own record not much for sure. We would go there & dig for oil lol 
But then let's see how we make it through this century, at the current rate it's doubtful we could even answer...
7832 2018-11-07 09:13:54 Lucu ketika denger analis bilang "beli dolar earners bro, bakal peform bagus tuh sahamnya.

Lucu juga ketika denger pemerintah bilang "harga minyak tinggi bagus untuk apbn."

USD & oil are function of costs, not revenues.

7852 2018-11-07 09:11:01 Chase you and @davidsirota are somewhat late comers to the fracking issue. You're referencing research of the Big Greens that partner with oil and gas. Interview leading methane emission scientists @howarth_cornell and Anthony Ingraffea. They'll explain it's much more dire!
7853 2018-11-07 09:10:55 We avoid adding palm oil to our products, however a few of the ingredients used do contain palm oil. We insist our suppliers only use certified sustainable palm oil. We take this issue seriously & are looking to replace palm oil in a number of our products in the near future.

7862 2018-11-07 09:10:21 Kalau muka berminyak, produk apa eh sesuai nak pakai? 

Aku selama ni pakai biasa punya je, yang ada kt pasaraya, cam Garnier Men laa, Aiken Tree Tea Oil Cleanser apa benda ntaaahhh. And produk2 yg tulis “Men” ah hahahahh. Main tibai je pakai apa pun asal pakai.
7863 2018-11-07 09:10:19 But in that scenario you're just taxing the "end users" and not "big oil". Carbon producers get to go on with no tax penalties with your neighbors carrying 100% of the tax burden, that wasn't the intention of 1631 initiative (although we all know we would get stuck with the bill)

7865 2018-11-07 09:10:06 200 hectares of palm trees is equivalent to one oil well... is this true?

7871 2018-11-07 09:09:03 On the plus side, it’s kinda fun to pretend for a few weeks every couple of years that we *don’t* actually live in a melting resource colony dominated by frontier cowboy doofuses and big oil C-suite nincompoops in bolo ties.
7872 2018-11-07 09:08:47 We can all thank 0bama and the Dims / plus the greedy Eurotrash / not to mention the scheming Putin / for bringing us that close to the brink. Putin wants his oil at $150, might well get it at $1500, and then at $15.

7875 2018-11-07 09:08:23 @Morrisons @asda @Tesco @sainsburys @BP_Press @Shell So the price of a barrel of oil has dropped by $14 over the last few weeks yet all of your fuel prices have continued to go up. When will prices at the pump reflect this 16% decrease? #ripofffuelprices

7914 2018-11-07 09:02:27 I certainly agree. These oil/greenhouse gas producing companies aren’t going to stop if it hurts their bottom line, since their products are necessary manufacturing goods. 

It’s important to consider how much of an impact these businesses have on the common people, even if (1)

7959 2018-11-07 08:51:45 दीपावली अर्थात् दीप + अवली ।
‘दीप’ का अर्थ दीपक तथा ‘अवली’ का अर्थ पंक्ति है ।
इस प्रकार दीपावली का अर्थ हुआ- दीपों की पंक्ति । 

Deepawali is correct, means Line of Oil Lamps.
Diwali is wrong as it has no meaning.
Please remember while wishing others.

But then again who really cares if the alternative is the current Democrats. Tied as they are to Wall St, NRA & Arms co's & oil, Americans are fucked either way, let alone Libya, Yemen, Syria etc.

8060 2018-11-07 08:32:51 I predict significant adaption and movement during the transition to renewables. It seems that pretty much all the oil/gas sector claims are based on a static world and all their speculation suddenly translating into fact.

I don't share your assumption that oil consumption will stay the same, nor do I think that existing use of gas won't shift. It's not halting extraction, just no new exploration.

8086 2018-11-07 08:28:28 1) policy will not impact oil consumption so our supply will be replaced by others. No impact on CO2.
2) if I assume 100% renewable electricity system by 2030 then gas is not needed for this. 
3) but half our gas is used to make methanol/urea that will simply be made elsewhere.

8150 2018-11-07 08:17:16 Great work @NZGreens! For NZ, drilling oil and gas would like pissing in your pants to stay warm in winter. With the developments in renewables, latest gen of nuclear reactors, Lockheed Martin and likes working on compact fusion reactors, this is the only sensible way to go.

8154 2018-11-07 08:16:52 I had a chat with him last night. He seems to think that petrol is a effectively a byproduct of oil refinement we use for other things like plastics, tyres, fabrics, tarmac etc.

I'm interested to know how much truth there is in that.
8155 2018-11-07 08:16:35 I think cleaning your house is considered good form. Also adding some rice flour "paila" footprints from your main gate to the door might help her find the way. Plus some oil lamps of course (Laxmi doesn't like plastic lightbulbs.)

The nourishment purpose of the oil is to also help it grow as healthy hair grows faster, stronger & thicker, while getting softer

8249 2018-11-07 08:02:34 That’s a great recipe (I love your sense of abandonment with butter and the olive oil at the end) and I really like a good risotto, but the constant standing at the stove makes it something I’m reluctant to cook very often.
8250 2018-11-07 08:02:26 You liked that didnt you Ben..
8251 2018-11-07 08:02:07 Well of course they where cheaper 8 years ago, that’s inflation and the world wide oil price rises. Point is the annual rises still occurred, unchecked for 13 years. Our prices are below average for Europe.

8257 2018-11-07 08:01:00 Western governments are challenging because they fear that china will destroy their markets and not because they sympathize with muslims. And muslim majority countries are busy enjoying their oil wealth, they never cared shit about anyone.
8258 2018-11-07 08:01:00 I could probably tweet all night about 1631, but honestly the long and short is Washington was had by big oil and the threat of paying any amount more is more terrifying than doing something constructive to hurt big polluters.

8374 2018-11-07 07:46:11 Correct, a n d  the midterms are over, so the real oil price may develop now. Iran is has been shut down since the beginning of Nov. 18 and Saudi Arabia won't donate its oil too cheap.

8384 2018-11-07 07:45:02 Trump will probably start an entirely unnecessary war with Iran to help win re-election. We'll have skyrocketing oil prices, a recession, a big stock market correction and a real estate slump.  It's going to be a very bad 2 years.

8400 2018-11-07 07:42:14 Encana/Cenovus oil/gas split was as dumb an idea ever cooked up in the executive suite. Newfield is a fix for incompetence. No government forced the oil industry to fuel the US shale revolution. Governments are trying to help the industry out of its self-inflicted wounds.

8451 2018-11-07 07:33:37 You don't know how this works.

Oil and gas companies have spent a few million on ad campaigns... let's call it $100 million to be conservative.

U.S. government spent $26 BILLION on it by 2010, according to its own GAO report. No doubt the figure was much large by 2016.

8501 2018-11-07 07:21:42 You probably blame PMB for the low prices of oil that led to the recession, for the recession itself, for inflation!
8502 2018-11-07 07:21:39 Exactly! Ppl r excited4 #FDFS or celebrity tvshows but not excited2celebrate with family. I grewup during DD era when Deepavali agenda was: wakeup early, apply oil, eat marandhu, burst first cracker, shikakai bath, newdress, sweets, burst crakckers with fam/friends& tasty food.

8516 2018-11-07 07:20:08 Definitely continue to call out repubs that obstruct our progress to combat climate change, but ALSO call out Dems who continue to be loobied by Big Oil and Fossil Fuel companies. They may say they believe in climate change, but their actions say otherwise!
8517 2018-11-07 07:19:57 Why not do both ? The USA imports both foreign students and foreign faculty. These will reinforce each other. 

India can spend its foreign exchange on researchers, not just on weapons and oil. It can even afford to pay selected top notch faculty in dollars.

8531 2018-11-07 07:16:44 (Satire) Maybe they are related? Propylene glycol is produced from oil, which comes from drilling, and is the main component of vape "e-juice". Insert clips of this disturbing video of this one guy vaping some 'Carolina Reaper' peppers, and use as evidence for banning vaping...
8532 2018-11-07 07:16:42 Sure Brother. I want India to stop importing expensive and polluting oil.
8533 2018-11-07 07:16:28 The next morning we wake up at dawn, have a complete oil bath, have sweets and savouries made especially for Deepavali, and burst crackers.  
This is done in all houses, so I dont think you are unaware of this.
8534 2018-11-07 07:16:17 If we count what the oil & gas industry spent on 74, @ColoradoRising was outspent 50-1. Their core team is truly heroic. Seen them pour sweat & blood  for many months!  The best news is that they are not going away! Stay tuned for these climate protectors' next action!

8629 2018-11-07 06:58:29 tea tree oil can help prevent fungal infections  get a good non-diluted essential oil kind from sprouts or Whole Foods - if you do this, use it when you’re able to let the nail air out rather than bandaging it up - and it’ll sting if you’ve got exposed raw skin
8630 2018-11-07 06:58:12 I think big oil money must have a lot to do with it. Then the propaganda about Dems taking their guns which is bullshit but everyone & their grandma is carrying in TX.
8631 2018-11-07 06:58:06 そして節分鬼ヶ城もいるぞい！
8632 2018-11-07 06:57:57 @realDonaldTrump Obamacare?  Still there.  Planned Parenthood? Still there. Iran? All those oil sanctions that got  all those exceptions. The swamp?  Still swampy. It's not what you say or how you say it. It's what you are doing.  Or not doing.
8633 2018-11-07 06:57:41 happy for the oil companies for being able to drill more places and not make all the people in the ads fade like infinity war because prop 112 failed
8634 2018-11-07 06:57:09 What did I hear you say? Most "felons are black who are Democrats?" Blexit is happening. Even the felons will get it before 2020. Black and Democrat is becoming like oil and water.
8635 2018-11-07 06:56:42 Medford Sucks.
Jackson County Sucks. Grand Old Poisoners are gonna fill the valley w/oil & light it up!

8643 2018-11-07 06:55:41 I have killed many times. All of them in the circle of squares. My big kick is deadly. Hold in your spare parts. Have an oil bath yourself
8644 2018-11-07 06:55:22 We just elected a man who will take away insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. A man that doesn’t represent the ordinary guy next door but represents oil companies. A man that himself is an immigrant yet unequivocally is anti-immigrant. #Midterm2018
8645 2018-11-07 06:55:07 気付いたんだ⁈
8646 2018-11-07 06:54:52 I vote so that my daughter & grandchildren will have a better life. I vote because I want to save our public lands & animals from oil & gas companies. I vote because I want all people to be treated equally. Bigotry needs to end.
8647 2018-11-07 06:54:27 Bitch gone we gone see how you get a oil change next month
8648 2018-11-07 06:54:16 Did you know that oil marketers charged as much as $87 per metric tonne as cost of ferrying PMS popularly known as petrol during Jonathan regime.

However under Buhari the highest that is being charged through competitive bidding is $7 per metric tonne.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
8665 2018-11-07 06:51:15 Ah thanks I’m going to try baby oil
8666 2018-11-07 06:51:04 oh then you gone be ight in like three weeks. Ice, elevate, ginger and turmeric. Some CBD oil and you’re beat than new.
8667 2018-11-07 06:50:55 Did you dip them in oil too?
8668 2018-11-07 06:50:50 U don’t have2be an economist 2figure it out. AB has sent 200 billions 2 Ottawa in equalization payments. Large%because of oil %gas. How much money do AB spend in BC&how much money do BC residents who work in Alberta spend in B.C.? Most of the doesn’t want to pay a carbon tax.

8675 2018-11-07 06:49:31 The supply narratives are ludicrously pro-cyclical. In Q1 2016, it was all about low-cost shale. $50-60 later and they are writing about acute shortages.  I’ve never found any investment research as consistently useless as oil supply analysis. The more I read, the less I know.

8679 2018-11-07 06:49:07 If I do nothing else worthwhile with my life I will see at least one oil exec drown tied to a chair as the tide rises in a flooded shell of a city
8680 2018-11-07 06:49:03 Flood the oil fields in Texas and strike a fucking match.

8682 2018-11-07 06:48:39 Not comparing Mr Drakerford to Mr Attire but it's the sort of thing that Mr Attire would have said.  We've had too many snake oil salesmen in the past. Perhaps it's time for a honest guy who will say it as it is, not interested in stunts  and try his best.
8683 2018-11-07 06:48:30 Again, it’s just my take... in the documentary, he was so gratedul for hockey even if being a goon meant getting er done. I have faith in our big oil boys.

8686 2018-11-07 06:47:52 That is not the only story. Heitkamp pissed off her tribal voters by turning on them and supporting the oil pipeline that they opposed. The GOP overreached by trying to screw them out of thier votes and just made the tribes angry. But not angry enough to fully back Heitkamp.

8690 2018-11-07 06:47:08 Our team was getting roughed all game, LOO turned to what he knew best & went with it. I think LOO may be trying to step back into what he knows as an enforcer, which he thanks the NHL for that chance. And my understanding was he had the OK from Mclellan so all lights were a go.
8691 2018-11-07 06:47:04 Chef Louis cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Play-Doh.
8692 2018-11-07 06:46:58 Can't wait until the media ignoring Donald Beggars! OIL. Unfortunately we also have!
8693 2018-11-07 06:46:55 I'm betting Russia's hacking of the last 10 years of Republican emails has pretty much compromised all of them.. explains all of this turnabout...  Trumps trashing of the Iranian nuclear deal..  and how blocking Iran's sale of oil enriches Russia by allowing oil prices to rise..
8694 2018-11-07 06:46:43 "Lookin' fine, bro! Check it out, we both got scarves! Now that's stylin'!" (Oil Man, MM Powered Up)
8695 2018-11-07 06:46:38 One hopes the event spends its time talking about the need to end oil use within the next two decades #climatechange
8696 2018-11-07 06:46:24 Its all economic victory until one of those fracking companies leaks oil into the aquifer contaminating water for hundreds of thousands of people. No common sense these people.
8697 2018-11-07 06:46:19 Oil and vinegar on their own only remain oil and vinegar. Even when put together they still remain separate, until they are shaken.  The  election has now mixed the oil and the vinegar.  Let’s work together to  get things done before the oil and vinegar again begin to separate.
8698 2018-11-07 06:46:03 Good idea.We need focus on a GOOD list, I wonder why there isn´t a standard mark/sign 4 all the products? PLS bare in mind some ORGS support RSPO, & there have been many cases where this is used 2 "legalize" T ussustainable palm oil .There must B  a strong palm oil lobby to stall

8705 2018-11-07 06:45:02 I'm pretty sure the CO oil well/fracking setback measure did too, though unfortunately I'm not surprised. Fossil fuel companies spent a LOT to kill that one here.
8706 2018-11-07 06:44:44 Oil Man is an alternate universe version of  Pirate Man ?
8707 2018-11-07 06:44:28 There were a lot of Dem seats up this year, and not many GOP. In the next election, the turn will go the other way.
There is no magic about #Trump, though he's an effective snake oil salesman. He lets other NON-ELECTED people do his job, while he watches TV & holds pep rallies.
8708 2018-11-07 06:44:18 ファイト！！
8709 2018-11-07 06:44:17 yes people do. Even add tomatoes too to give the red colour plam oil was suppose to give

8720 2018-11-07 06:43:22 i disagree. in OK, for example, it’s young people seeing that when we don’t vote, all the old people who vote for tax cuts— specifically for the oil industry— that have gutted our public education system will continue to screw up the future because it doesn’t affect them
8721 2018-11-07 06:43:13 U need to change ur engine oil. Visit @Elykplim lube bay inside bortianor for a top notch annual service and get a free gearbox and axle service. Thank me later
8722 2018-11-07 06:43:12 If I lived in Florida, I would indoor vape crude oil.
8723 2018-11-07 06:42:48 Gas prices going down isn’t a good thing? No more people should ride a fuckin bike or ride the bus or car pool or use Uber the Earth won’t be able to keep up with the demand for oil. And you said a good chunk of houses were built in the last 60 years? Jesus Christ was a carpenter

8735 2018-11-07 06:40:46 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8736 2018-11-07 06:40:46 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8737 2018-11-07 06:40:40 What damn shame...You could tell how much money was poured into "No on 1631" by those oil companies. Would see literally hundreds of signs within a half mile driving down the road and non-stop TV ads too. This is why we need money out of politics!

8740 2018-11-07 06:40:18 Corps were told drop it. One week before Kavanaugh hearing. Kochs are oil guys, who don't like Trump. It may have been, you want our Koch minions to vote for your SCOTUS nominee, we want expensive airbrake technology to die. Cory Gardner from my State, CO, is owned by Kochs.

8742 2018-11-07 06:39:49 Every common citizen shud be banned from Delhi. These tax payers, middle-class, poor people, driving their cheap cars & 2-wheelers, trying to burst their non-green firecrackers, lighting their oil wasting diyas.

Delhi shud be exclusively for the high & mighty rulers of India.
8743 2018-11-07 06:39:37 I don't know. Not an economist. How about the cleanup? Canadians will have to do that after foreign oil co's flee the country when prices drop again? Hell, I hear Alta doesn't even want to pay a carbon tax lol
8744 2018-11-07 06:39:33 Move to Wyoming they need people. Good luck you're going to need it. Especially in Wyoming. Unless you're willing to work in the oil field. You've got very little shot at making a livable wage.

8746 2018-11-07 06:39:26 Iowa has been hit by soybean trade war. Prices have dropped by 90%, no kidding.

Separate but related topic, two corps in Cedar Rapids were developing air brakes for use on oil trains, to make trains much much safer. Trump signed EO negating need for airbrakes.
8747 2018-11-07 06:39:19 It’s also a giant oil well.
8748 2018-11-07 06:38:49 Are you kidding or what? They got us out through which lobby? We were in a debt overhang of 30 billion dollars and they negotiated to pay 18b and got 12b cancelled out of negotiations. Which they did successfully. Oil has averaged btw 62$ for 2018 and what has PMB got show for it
8749 2018-11-07 06:38:49 Did I see you talking about manufacturing?? How can that happen when Tullow is expected to ship out crude oil to be refined abroad next year ??? Misplaced priorities. Tell your clients next time you call them.
8750 2018-11-07 06:38:35 70 million from outside sources could not pull out a win in Texas. The snake oil salesman fooled many but not enough.
8751 2018-11-07 06:38:34 I'm pretty fucking pissed that I-1631 lost.

It was a pretty fucking reasonable implementation of a carbon tax.

I guess all the millions in ads the oil/gas companies pumped into the state worked.

Fucking IDIOTS.
8752 2018-11-07 06:38:30 #thedrum Trump is a con man plain and simple. Selling snake oil.

8755 2018-11-07 06:38:23 How does voting republican make you racist and dirty and homophobic? Youre just throwing shit out there. Im assuming youre grouping republican = trump lover without using any logic. How about that beto wanted a 10$ tax on oil? You really wanted to pay even more for gas?

Norway has a large budget surplus because smart enough to know oil income ends soon when Global Warming forces end to burning oil. Others also budget for bad times?

8785 2018-11-07 06:33:39 You should just supply reputable retailers to avoid all that. But also everytime cooking oil is put in supermarkets, vendors are the first to know and they clear out half the stock for resale. TM putting it at the till points was for control purposes
8786 2018-11-07 06:33:31 Same, I was a bit surprised by that considering how the oil industry was hit so hard during the Obama years.

8804 2018-11-07 06:31:23 Yeah personally I wish Texas would just succeed from the union. They have nothing to add but oil which is being replaced and every Texan I have met don't consider themselves part of America. Personally I like you work and hope you move north to civilization.

8836 2018-11-07 06:26:47 Oil wasn't discovered in ottoman empire regions until 1927. UK already had access to oil via concession from king of Iran in 1908. Note drilling concession, we didn't steal any land to do it.

So you're saving we went to war for something we didn't know existed until 13yrs later.

8861 2018-11-07 06:23:16 Yes but the disparity between the number of female and male within that industry is what I like to point out. 

Is it fair to compare 100 mens' salary with 10 womens' salary in the oil rig job for example? There are many factors to consider here.

8907 2018-11-07 06:16:57 You can do it michi!!! Add oil!!
8908 2018-11-07 06:16:38 The future of FL is oil soaked beaches, dead Everglades, dead lakes and rivers, and Trump, Scott & DeSantis laughing their asses off all the way to their Swiss banks. Florida isn't going to be any less destroyed for Republicans. We all lose big time. Call for election audit.

8919 2018-11-07 06:15:04 I guess if you underfund education long enough, you get a greater percentage of people who become prey to bible-thumpers and snake oil salesmen. Tragic.
8920 2018-11-07 06:15:03 And the new oil and gas law passed today back home too!

8924 2018-11-07 06:14:41 Hope no restrictions on burning Diyas in evening today. And also any guidelines on how much oil can we pour per diya? Details maybe released in sometime based on crude per barrel prices and dollar movement.

Why people like you and me need to get subsidy
And oil companies will suffer and will invest less in new exploration of oil and gas fields and new technology & gov will invest less in infrastructure

8930 2018-11-07 06:13:36 I think they can build them without oil. Of course I am not positive but certainly in Quebec they are doing work on batteries and storing hydro electric power. They may not be completely able to wean off oil but consumption will go down.
8931 2018-11-07 06:13:32 Better Get You Some Free Brakes Or Oil Change 
8932 2018-11-07 06:13:31 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
8933 2018-11-07 06:13:20 Oil is about to run out in 55 years boy. If you wanna stay in that industry then educate yourself on clean energy jobs
8934 2018-11-07 06:13:19 Money driven madness has taken over our beautiful game. Oil rich barons who had no real understanding of the English game. They purchased a corner shop without customers when they should of bought Newcastle or Leeds United. Yes city’s  success on the field but that’s all really
8935 2018-11-07 06:13:14 As a citizen of Canada or I assume you are how much did you benefit from oil and gas revenues?
8936 2018-11-07 06:13:10 Even some "Clean at Sephora" sealed cosmetics, which are supposedly made without mineral oil, have petroleum-derived ingredients in them. Details, I guess.
8937 2018-11-07 06:13:08 @nitin_gadkari 
Are you delaying tesla's entry to India for supporting oil barons?
No Indian manufacturer is not competent when compared to Tesla still you insist all those stupid regulations. You don't impose a fine on a brilliant child instead you give a scholarship.
8938 2018-11-07 06:12:53 But his presence was apparently the reason why it wasn't happening and yet it happened all night long. If he is going to try & make an impact doing that sort of thing, how about doing while the game is still in the balance and not after the fact? What he did serves no purpose.
8939 2018-11-07 06:12:48 I know that we've been in an always oil & perpetual war economy since 1888 and it will probably take Putin, Trump, Obama & the best of the best to stop civilization from retrograding into the void. #WeAreAllInThisTogether
8940 2018-11-07 06:12:34 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
8941 2018-11-07 06:12:30 I understand it perfectly. Get together. Make noise and a scene until govt gives you your way. Squeaky wheel gets the oil, even if said wheel is more a hindrance than benefit to that which its attached
8942 2018-11-07 06:12:13 slap on some jojoba oil and go to sleep
8943 2018-11-07 06:12:10 Hey 40th ain’t bad for educating all those kids who come over the border at a constant rate. But I was more referring to the jobs in Texas. The oil & gas industry is booming down there.

8945 2018-11-07 06:12:06 That can’t build EVs without oil. Cool cars for sure and a good way to reduce emissions in cities.
8946 2018-11-07 06:12:00 Apparently we love our oil money and “family values” as much as we hate the evil brown caravan invasion... Ugh, so sorry, y’all!
8947 2018-11-07 06:11:50 You mentioned me. Why should this tweet be relevant to me. A Saudi has given a flower to Diana. Many gave flowers to her.  This Saud is for me nothing than a human like everybody else. Even as statesman, I don't respect him. Without oil he would be a barbar in the desert.

8956 2018-11-07 06:10:35 I agree with you in part we need an investigation but some of us just cant up & move we also cant behave & act like the left we now need to hold them to the fire & keep exposing their snake oil

8962 2018-11-07 06:10:02 Ahaha! Mi a go get sum miself. I'm guilty of burning da midnight oil. But, mom has an appointment, so I have to get up early.
8963 2018-11-07 06:09:50 True except maybe in places where they have hydro electric power. I'm guessing though demand for oil will go down. Won't be pretty when it does go down in AB cuz it's already not providing us with much revenue.
8964 2018-11-07 06:09:37 Facts, aka 30 million dollars from 5 oil companies
8965 2018-11-07 06:09:28 I would go to work, except I'm retired.  So I'll take the dogs for a walk and then celebrate my birthday by getting my car's oil changed.
8966 2018-11-07 06:09:13 My two cents.  Texas pours a lot of money into oil and fracking.
Beto apparently made comments about being against fracking in the state..but they were heard by many who invest in it.
That's one rock in the water he shouldn't have thrown.
I believe it was the nail in the coffin
8967 2018-11-07 06:08:56 Offshore oil drilling is HUGE! I’m very happy that passed
8968 2018-11-07 06:08:55 "Women make less than men"

Well yeah, have you considered the job choices they make? I dont see a lot of women working in oil rigs. 

Have you considered that women leave the workforce after childbirth to take care of the family?

Why is this a bad thing?

8979 2018-11-07 06:06:26 It’s mainly also about the ingredients & reading what’s in them too; for you it’s important to have WATER based & I stress this b/c if u use oil based products it’s just going to give a negative reaction & clog your pores even more since those are more for hydration for dry skin

8982 2018-11-07 06:06:11 If you really looked into the law, you were writing a check that effected your average consumer more then big oil and corporations. Afterwards you want to have a non elected panel control the money the taxes produced. Are you serious, overwhelmingly rejected and justified.
8983 2018-11-07 06:06:00 A balanced approach is both wind energy and solar energy. 
NEVER OIL AND GAS.
8984 2018-11-07 06:05:55 Tbf, if you’re voting to allow oil drilling JUST so you can vape at work, is still shameful.  If you’re still ale to vape elsewhere
8985 2018-11-07 06:05:50 The fire is a basket of garnets, and the book is upside down on my knee. The oil lamp is spent, so I light the candle, watch the first smoke wriggle from the wax. The clock whispers 4.00am. The door opens, and she stands, accusing, shawl on  shoulders, face wan, still scowling.

9006 2018-11-07 06:02:18 Go check the records and mind you that averagely crude oil was on average of 18-58$ btw 1999 and 2007 and that particular govt was able to get us out of the IMF/WB debt overhang. These are fact and not APC's propagandas.

9026 2018-11-07 05:59:46 Colorado did the smart thing and rejected a lot of Republicans up for election tonight. It’s sad to see this state continue to cave to oil special interests, but at least 74 didn’t pass.

9028 2018-11-07 05:59:38 EVs need Oil to exist. They don’t need to use oil or liquid fuels but they can’t be built without them. This is an old argument. Until there is no axle. For transportation oil will always be nesasarry

9034 2018-11-07 05:58:50 Soy overproduction should be shipped to starving Venezuelans. The oil needed for transport and farm inputs could be supplied by Venezuela. 

Clearly capitalism fails to allocate resources efficiently, if Venezuelans have oil but are starving while American soy is overproduced.

9037 2018-11-07 05:58:14 Yeah. I do. Venezuela has the most oil to export in the world, and they ruined it and now people are starving. Already ate the zoo animals and are actually being oppressed because of trying to give people “free” healthcare, food, education and everything
9038 2018-11-07 05:58:11 Oil price could touch $100 on supply crunch, says Citi
9039 2018-11-07 05:57:40 Well. It’s hard but not impossible to make oil companies keep families safe. Otherwise they can do whatever they want.
9040 2018-11-07 05:57:38 Just like how dawn helps break down tough kitchen grease it also can break down oils during oil spills! Amazing. #apeswater @franklinlorax

9042 2018-11-07 05:57:11 im disappointed that 2.4 MILLION floridians voted yes to allow oil drilling on our coastline. disgusting
9043 2018-11-07 05:57:09 And if we had a damn P/L (& less Saudi Oil purchasing) we could afford all kinds of things we can’t afford now in Canada.
9044 2018-11-07 05:56:56 “I’m a part of the 18% of the country that can drive stick shift”

9047 2018-11-07 05:56:37 We tax the crap out of oil and gas here, which is why we have a balanced budget. I'm glad of it. Texas Republicans are more reasonable than national Republicans. That's why we give in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants. It's why we fund our university system so well.

9055 2018-11-07 05:55:48 Sucks that most people don't take the time to read the details in the voter guide. The ads paid for by big oil her in Washington were so pervasive and convinced people that it wasn't well thought out and would cost consumers. WA needs to explain it better next time.
9056 2018-11-07 05:55:48 we restored felons right to vote and banned offshore oil drilling, dog racing, and lobbying; some pretty big landmarks for FL imo
9057 2018-11-07 05:55:47 มันแคบ  พื้นที่ไม่พอสำหรับอีก1ที่ค่ะ 
9058 2018-11-07 05:55:40 Now more than ever before, this isn’t a sign to give up. WAKE UP! You guys didn’t just vote for names on a ballot, you guys voted for all the changes being fought for. Celebrate what’s done. 

 VOTER RESTORATION
 OIL/GAS DRILLING PROHIBITION
 DOG RACE BANNING
9059 2018-11-07 05:55:37 Most countries that have oil give it away iran Venezuela Canada. coal they give it away to the Chinese wood we give it away  not  in the finished product, what is wrong with canada? Or the other countries. But buy something Canada pays top price for goods including our oil gas

9064 2018-11-07 05:54:52 How about a tariff on oil imported from Saudi Arabia 
#cdnpoli #Saudi_Arabia
9065 2018-11-07 05:54:45 Texas has oil, therefore it will remain a red state. That is just a fact that will not change. Texas is a refuge for many Dreamers and many immigrated people, people who unfortunately cannot vote. Texas did nothing wrong as a whole, we just need to come together AGAIN.
9066 2018-11-07 05:54:40 Regardless of political bent, I’m convinced cannabis, marijuana and hemp, are the “next big”. Been recruited in. Knew nothing. Still learning. But two months of using CBD oil and interacting with hundreds. My physical experience, anecdotes, and science I’ve seen are mind blowing.

9070 2018-11-07 05:54:14 We have to fix Constitutional problems like Tabor before raising taxes and big oil simply bought a win on 112. Dems did great state wide so I still day we are a blue State. Next we take down @CoryGardner!
9071 2018-11-07 05:53:55 Big for some drillers: Colorado voters reject measure that would've banned drilling and exploration across half the state. Would've been huge blow for the likes of @BP_America @Anadarko_Oil and other producers. Rejected by 57.5% ... will shares move today? #OOTT #energy #shale
9072 2018-11-07 05:53:49 I wanted it to pass too, but then I realized that in spite of the fact that the No was being sponsored by Big Oil, it was in fact a regressive tax under current circumstances. With the cost of living in the centers rising rapidly, the people furthest away (most gas) ...
9073 2018-11-07 05:53:14 Dude, did you get a body high from the pain? The ONE time I had ghost pepper seed oil I was toast for 15 minutes before the endorphins released
9074 2018-11-07 05:53:10 I rather prefer "Colorado's redneck  cattle and oil conservatives took it long, hard, deep, and  dry." Pretty much sums it up.

9076 2018-11-07 05:52:51 I guess I've been lucky, mine come out buttery and delicious. I guess it's the olive oil I add, and you can never go wrong by covering them with lots of cheese.

9081 2018-11-07 05:51:36 Yeah, that was the line the oil companies were pushing. We should have enacted this.

9087 2018-11-07 05:50:26 But indoor oil drilling and offshore vaping are fine.
9088 2018-11-07 05:50:20 Maxine Waters wants to nationalize oil and gas companies and have the post office do banking. What could possibly go wrong?

9094 2018-11-07 05:49:45 This election was not great for enviro ballot measures. WA voters rejected a carbon fee, AZ voters rejected a renewable standard, and CO voters rejected what was effectively an oil and gas drilling ban. We need to do better.

9106 2018-11-07 05:48:35 Y’all voting in people that disregard minorities just so you can continue to live in your plastic bubble of ignorance while the same niggas you put in office still believe in poisoning your water sources for oil industry money. That’s the biggest GAG.
9107 2018-11-07 05:48:32 Years ago my car was leaking oil and I wondered if I could make it stop by anointing it with olive oil. I didn't have enough faith to try it so I'll never know.

9111 2018-11-07 05:47:50 So we should slap a carbon tax onto Chinese made goods to account for that, and to level the playing field. And we should do the same for Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil, as both of those don't have carbon taxes either. And many others.

9117 2018-11-07 05:47:14 Shoulda noticed that. But FYI, the Oil Company "Think Tanks" that originally spread those stories about Climate Change being a hoax have changed their tune: "The newly violent weather will be good for the USA –– cuz the third world will not be able to handle the economic damage."

9126 2018-11-07 05:46:25 I started having a runny nose a few hours ago and I’ve been trying to use everything I have available to fight it off. Humidifiers going and a diffuser with eucalyptus oil, a couple shots of whiskey, chugged a dose of emergenC, drinking water.. what else y’all!?
9127 2018-11-07 05:46:23 Chris, Texas is owned & run by GOP oil oligarchs. Has been since JFK was assassinated there, after which a Texan took over the presidency & kept the oil gluttons happy with gov't quid pro quo. Bush oil shills cheated their way into the WH just like Johnson. It's Texas.

9133 2018-11-07 05:45:05 I internally cringe when coconut oil is used in vegan baking recipes, it makes everything settle weird, go bad faster, and makes cookies oily 
9134 2018-11-07 05:45:04 There is this woman at work who gets her car's fuel tank topped for 1,500 rupees and the engine oil changed for 10,000 rupees.

9142 2018-11-07 05:44:06 Well, disappointed with pretty much all of the ballot outcomes in CO. Oil and gas will be developed near cities and our schools will continue to not get funded. Nonpartisan redistricting and also we banned slavery so that's good.

9150 2018-11-07 05:43:01 Disappointing. We could have paved the way here by putting our money where our mouth is. Carbon needs to be taxed to reduce the speed of the cycle we are in of destroying our planet. We let big oil win this round. I thought my neighbors believed in sustainability, I was wrong

They didn't.

They didn't.

They did.

9168 2018-11-07 05:40:39 Dammit the carbon fee in WA didn’t pass. $31 million spent in opposition from the oil industry, vs $15M spent in favor. Swing left, let’s swing renewables now. @seattletimes

9174 2018-11-07 05:39:40 ive seen that too! it makes it even harder to tell what to choose;; and then u gotta wonder like. how much Big Oil money is gettin spent trying to keep it from being passed and if thats behind any of the opposition. but the idea that the customers would pay is definitely an issue

9176 2018-11-07 05:39:39 Someone pls convince @lesliealmanza25 to get this oil change ;)
9177 2018-11-07 05:39:30 Voting is not an amoral action. There is causality. You have, intentionally or otherwise, hurt people that are targets of those you elect. I chose to hurt CEO's and oil miners and some of yall chose to hurt immigrants and minorities. Hope Jeff Bezos gives you some good tail forit
9178 2018-11-07 05:39:20 This time I was able to keep the tofu from sticking to the pan by adding a bunch of oil
which is good
except that means I added a bunch of oil to the tofu
9179 2018-11-07 05:39:06 Sorry y’all I gotta get an oil change tomorrow and I’m anxious as hell lmfao shouldn’t be nothing wrong with my car... but one time I took the car there and the battery died and I went through a whole ordeal because I’m dumb.
9180 2018-11-07 05:39:06 No Texas stayed with the snake oil salesmen!
9181 2018-11-07 05:39:05 What you say is completely true, except I have it on good authority that it was NOT a real alligator; it was an alligator suit and Wesson oil was involved.
9182 2018-11-07 05:38:36 わっしーくんでかくない？

9184 2018-11-07 05:38:33 Colorado voters are defeating ballot measure 112 that would have all but banned new oil&gas drilling in the state, according the Denver Post.  57-42 w/ 75% reporting

9186 2018-11-07 05:37:56 I started using shampoo bars from lush and so far I love them! They have ones with honey and argan oil in them which do wonders to your hair. Lots of natural ingredients too.

9190 2018-11-07 05:37:36 tea tree oil yg 10ml. nanti kamu pakenya itu kaya ditotolin gitu ke jerawatnya sama bisa ngilangin bekasnya
9191 2018-11-07 05:37:11 So we basically invade countries to 'bring them democracy" (if they have oil at least) but when it comes to our own country they make it an obstacle course  for everyone to vote. WTF really?
9192 2018-11-07 05:37:06 TAKUMI OILとか？
9193 2018-11-07 05:36:57 Look for oil wells, casinos, nascar tracks and football stadiums on beaches now, and several hundred species extinctions. Florida nature is solidly fucked. #electionnight #stayinline
9194 2018-11-07 05:36:51 Olive oil is nontoxic, chemo isn't.
9195 2018-11-07 05:36:49 Un fantasme ? 
Je crois que nous tenons un scientiste, qui pense que nous pouvons exploiter une ressource à l’infini, en contradiction avec les bases des sciences physiques et géologiques.
Pour information, le peak oil conventionnel et non conventionnel Chinois est pour 2018.
9196 2018-11-07 05:36:48 I exfoliated, shaved and put on body oil.

Don't even get near me, I'm better than you.

 :( she was soooo stressed out. Wanna Sleep but my nose, throat and eyes are irritated 
9199 2018-11-07 05:36:31 綺麗なのか！
9200 2018-11-07 05:36:12 Wow. Tonight was quite the victory for big oil and gas in Colorado... very fucking disappointing.
9201 2018-11-07 05:35:55 any of the low population, agriculture/coal/oil based states can fit the context, both south and north dakotas for instance. combined the 2 states have about 1.6 million people. california by itself has 39 million. yet both states only get 2 senators each.
9202 2018-11-07 05:35:55 Barack Obama
9203 2018-11-07 05:35:55 Yeah, we really tried, but Big Oil came in strong with the $$$, of course.  Fuckers.
9204 2018-11-07 05:35:51 It looks like Big Oil will succeed in defeating the carbon pricing initiative in Washington, too. 

If this election isn’t a clear sign that we need to break the power of the fossil fuel industry, I don’t know what is.
9205 2018-11-07 05:35:47 ... #electionnight Look for oil wells, casinos, nascar tracks and football stadiums on beaches now, and several hundred species extinctions. Florida nature is solidly fucked.
9206 2018-11-07 05:35:28 We should let Texas secede so we can invade them for oil now
9207 2018-11-07 05:35:28 I fucken hate when people snap & the camera is all dirty with oil from the fingers , smh like clean that shit
9208 2018-11-07 05:35:25 I just found one and am putting peppermint oil everywhere like begone foul demons.
9209 2018-11-07 05:34:53 @Tristan1986 I disagree with you as to the brussel sprouts. You have to try them  roasted with a olive oil, salt and pepper and fresh garlic and sprinkled with a mix of white cheeses. Yum Yum #safarilive
9210 2018-11-07 05:34:53 Quit buying Saudi Oil
9211 2018-11-07 05:34:52 this tea tree oil rly burnin a nigga eyes rn
9212 2018-11-07 05:34:34 So we basically invade countries to 'bring them democracy" (if they have oil at least) but when it comes to our own country they make it a shitshow for everyone to vote. WTF really?
9213 2018-11-07 05:34:24 Nimra name walon ko Dalta oil my pakaya jayeg 
9214 2018-11-07 05:33:45 olive oil maybe! I use olive oil for double cleansing on makeup days

9216 2018-11-07 05:33:34 If I see one more oil drum I'm gonna lose it. Very thankful but I'm tired!!! Almost 24 wide awake.
9217 2018-11-07 05:33:24 The voters in Florida did two good things tonight. They did Not elect open borders twat Andrew Gillum and they banned offshore oil drilling. GOODIE.
9218 2018-11-07 05:33:00 SLO County Measure G, the fracking and oil drilling ban, is poised to lose. No votes are currently at 56.57%
9219 2018-11-07 05:32:58 3.6b is allocated in pretendy paperwork figures. Clearly it should be far less in same way oil and whisky revenues and other revenue returns should be more. Way it is.
9220 2018-11-07 05:32:54 病院の帰りにグルグル四キロくらい散策してみたんだけど、チカレタビー。
9221 2018-11-07 05:32:53 A majority of voters in Colorado supported fracking setbacks — then Big Oil spent over $40 MILLION on fear-mongering and false advertising. 

That’s called buying an election.
9222 2018-11-07 05:32:43 I was craving a SMALL snack.
My Italian father proceeded to bring to me an antipasto platter filled with prosciutto, capicollo, salami, sopressata, eggplant, Italian bread with olive oil and oregano, 4 types of cheeses, and assorted olives....... 
9223 2018-11-07 05:32:38 I feel like my love handles are made of pure extra virgin olive oil and feta cheese
9224 2018-11-07 05:32:33 Republicans want that $$$$. Texas a business minded state with all these oil fields n shit. oid and traditional, Anti marijuana & alllat

9228 2018-11-07 05:32:22 Burning the midnight oil again. Might not feel great in the morning, but I'm super excited about what I have planned for class.
9229 2018-11-07 05:32:07 Good job voters of Missouri.
Our state has finally gone green  

I guess when people now try to push CBD oil on me, I can't tell them it's not legal in my state 

Before anyone asks. It's still not legal in my school district, so don't ask. #ElectionDay2018
9230 2018-11-07 05:32:04 How many oil and gas companies will now fold up shop and leave? What little health care choices we have gone Tabor Amendment gutted windmills and bike lanes everywhere more gun laws coming our way too
9231 2018-11-07 05:31:59  palm oil or nothing abeg
9232 2018-11-07 05:31:55 "I am alive at night. I am dead in the morning, an old vessel who used up her oil, bleak and pale boned." - Anne Sexton
9233 2018-11-07 05:31:50 Is there groundnut oil beans bikonu...pls palm oil beans all the way
9234 2018-11-07 05:31:46 Let’s associate the term “drilling” with the mining and oil industries and not with education.
9235 2018-11-07 05:31:44 Lol please read your tweet before you post it, or at least let your mom check it.... But to address your point, how does a $10 per barrel tax on oil companies in TEXAS benefit the people? It would only hurt the PEOPLE of this great state but hey you did your research right...
9236 2018-11-07 05:31:42 Choke on your Patchouli oil and die, Grewn voters
9237 2018-11-07 05:31:28 They've started again with theories they can't explain in practice. Human development comes to fruition with proceeds from oil and gas. I thought she's focusing on renewable energy and expansion of the energy sector to enable jobs and businesses.
9238 2018-11-07 05:31:25 2/3 of Canada shouldn’t be running on Saudi Oil either. The fact that the largest oil refinery in Canada was built to refine Saudi oil products, is a slap in the face to our great country.
9239 2018-11-07 05:31:22 Exactly!!! She wants to socialize our oil industry! There’s video of her slipping up and saying it. She doesn’t even live in the district!!!
9240 2018-11-07 05:31:18 Somebody...
Anybody...

Just rub some coconut oil over America. #UhBegYuh
9241 2018-11-07 05:30:59 Aloe Vera juice, black castor oil, tea tree oil and raw coconut oil really has my hair taking off  it’s been a journey!
9242 2018-11-07 05:30:51 I live in TX.  Cruz is for guns,  for Texas oil,  and folks are happy with the economy so they give him credit he doesn't deserve.  The fact that he's an ass clown doesn't matter to many.   Beto is too far left for TX; if he were a bit more moderate on some issues he'd win.
9243 2018-11-07 05:30:36 I really believe it is due to cheating. I’m so pissed off because of big oil fucks.

9246 2018-11-07 05:30:12 Do you not know what the fuck renewable & clean energy is...?

They're considered to be an alternative to traditional fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
For example wind turbines; they use the sun's energy to generate clean electricity
9247 2018-11-07 05:29:58 Oil prices slids as rising output and US sanction waivers that allow Iran's biggest buyers to keep taking its crude reinforced the outlook for a well-supplied market.

9254 2018-11-07 05:28:52 She is critical of A to Z of this govt. S 400  Iran oil & port Russian frigates r clear indicators. US is satisfying its ego by giving a waiver.
9255 2018-11-07 05:28:40 Me too. I had to trade in my F-350 because I was going through hubs and whatnot at breakneck. Got a Highlander and have to have a "rough use" inspection thing when I get my oil changed. Smh.
9256 2018-11-07 05:28:26 Checking the oil.

9261 2018-11-07 05:27:28 I actually had several discussions with some big oil guys in midland, texas.
the subject was me building a city around midland and water was my main concern.
the big wig told me that the desalination tech they have is amazing but Nestle & the water mafia are iron fisting things.

9265 2018-11-07 05:27:10 Just because you live in a rural area doesn't mean this won't impact you. Fracking is happening mostly in rural areas eg. Rosebud, Alberta. I'm guessing when it comes to the cities folks might be more interested. I doubt the world will fail when oil fails in AB. AB small potatoes
9266 2018-11-07 05:26:57 After tonight, I really think many New Mexicans enjoy being the last at everything and the worst state in the Union as they voted to keep us down.  I can only pray that isn't the case.  But I fear things will only get worse - especially for the oil industry.
9267 2018-11-07 05:26:53 เชี่ย แกรบบีเอ็ม ทำไมไม่เจอบ้างง 5555
9268 2018-11-07 05:26:40 Stuff I know I'm never gonna use again art supply wise, I just struggle with it to get something passable, then move on. I don't fux with oil pastels/chalk pastels/oil point/wire sculpture...I learned a lot of stuff I don't really use anymore XD

9273 2018-11-07 05:26:04 I don't think it is end of the world. We're moving towards EV. We're also going towards a technological disruption with AI and 3D printing. I think the demand for oil will go down. We can't simply pretend that the liabilities will be paid for as traditionally no one pays but us.
9274 2018-11-07 05:26:00 smh......big oil wins, again.
9275 2018-11-07 05:25:51 That oil is the main thing na

9280 2018-11-07 05:24:58 US-Saudi relationship is based on shared interests & NOT values . It's Petro$ that Saudi uses to subdue America. if America dares to act , they will push up the prices of oil to $200, have a Russian base & they will kill the petrodollar. That's why US can't & won' do anything.
9281 2018-11-07 05:24:58 nope. I’m being boring. Tone, oil, moisturize. I need a new skin care routine
9282 2018-11-07 05:24:43 Everyone knows vape pens are the backbone of the oil industry
9283 2018-11-07 05:24:42 While I admit I didn't think they gun prop would pass ((thaaaaaank fucking god it did jesus christ)) I was honestly seriously surprised to see the fuckin Oil prop go through of all things
9284 2018-11-07 05:24:37 You should’ve asked me!! Around these months it’s bad for us  but that shea butter and coconut oil do me right after every shower, when you come home I can give you some cream I got from the doctor that work good to

9287 2018-11-07 05:23:49 I voted Republican. If Democrats take the House, the Democrats and RHINO NeverTrumpers will try to Impeach, Mueller will sell snake oil.
9288 2018-11-07 05:23:43 I'm disappointed that so many people have given in to big oil companies like the Koch brothers. We had an opportunity to stand up for our state environment. This will effect residents as well as our tourism industry. We will pay with$ for health problems like asthma.
9289 2018-11-07 05:23:37 All political parties complicit in this deferral of liabilities to taxpayers. Tapcal Trust Fund PCs did the first job of essentially not requiring upfront insurance of a significant amount. Liberals changed BIA so that banks get their money from bankrupt oil companies. We pay.
9290 2018-11-07 05:23:37 Only if you are using exclusively Canadian Oil...
9291 2018-11-07 05:23:30 Vitamin E oil daily will almost completely heal that! My mom had the same problem

9294 2018-11-07 05:23:11 I have the same issue w/ dry sensitive skin. You might want to check out Trilogy Organic Rosehip Oil. Amazon sells it $23 for .67 oz which is not too bad considering how little you need. It’s helped my skin tremendously. I’m also taking @GlamLifeGuru Halo HSN..which is AMAZING
9295 2018-11-07 05:23:10 Muslims ko koi bhi positive baat nhi Samgh me aati. Okay fine take AK47 and attack Iran. Bring all gas and oil to India.
9296 2018-11-07 05:23:05 Ah gotcha. I’ve looked into CBD oil a fair amount out of curiosity. I don’t have anxiety or difficulty sleeping etc but I think if I ever did I would try that  first over a prescription
9297 2018-11-07 05:23:02 Now... I’m going to take ALL of the CBD oil and eat ALL of the tacos!
Tomorrow my loves... we keep on fucking fighting! Good night!!

9300 2018-11-07 05:22:50 Apparently Gillum’s supposed to be really charismatic. caught a bit of his speech in which he talked about his grandmother anointing him & his siblings with vegetable oil on the forehead before they would leave for school & im finding that a bit odd of a memory to pivot to.

9309 2018-11-07 05:21:57 We reject fracking in oil and gas but elect a Jewish, gay politician .  #allgood and it is a very accepting place #coloradoliving
9310 2018-11-07 05:21:55 So we can expect to see that fiscal responsibility they been harping about kick in?

9312 2018-11-07 05:21:17 All good outcomes, especially 112, as I work in oil and gas. Not thrilled about the governor, though.

9317 2018-11-07 05:20:38 “Fracking-to take one example-was not the brainchild of private-sector research but the fruit of research paid for twenty years ago by the DOE. Yet fracking has collapsed the price of oil and gas and led to American energy independence.” #MichaelLewis #TheFifthRisk

9320 2018-11-07 05:20:11 Mine wasn’t that damaged when I did it but I got a cut right after and my hairs super strong. I always wait at least one day b/w bleaches and pop some olive oil in the microwave for 15 seconds leave it on the ends overnight and shampoo and do the next round the next day.
9321 2018-11-07 05:20:06 Texas produces the most oil... y’all really thought Texas was gonna vote for Beto? No one in the oil and refinery industry wants to pay more money on taxes!!!
9322 2018-11-07 05:20:06 I am not sure about that. 1990s meant the lowering of taxes and tarrifs across the world. However it meant Caribbean nations became more exposed to global changes than before - financial, oil & food crises, etc. It meant they needed to find a means to retain public services.
9323 2018-11-07 05:19:27 Can we put tariffs on the water, oil and electricity that they need from us?

9329 2018-11-07 05:19:10 the crazy thing is that you can 3D print structures in an airless vacuum out of glass & they would be stronger than iron.

9332 2018-11-07 05:19:04 Last I checked the house can do a lot of shit. Like demand docs subpoena people and force them to own up or go away. So what if the Senate is stacked with people actively trying to kill pre existing conditions and give oil companies a pass to pollute. Ewww. Down with heil trump
9333 2018-11-07 05:19:01 No listen!!!! It’s works better to Toast the bread because of the oil!! I promise it doesn’t taste different and it makes a more even toastiness!!!
9334 2018-11-07 05:18:35 Tonight we console each other. Tomorrow, WA, we are gonna have a fucking talk about believing absurd Big Oil lies.
9335 2018-11-07 05:18:33 Fun fact: I was born at 4:20 in the morning and somehow have never experienced weed (outside of CBD oil, doesn't count). This feels fundamentally wrong to me. Still waiting for VA to pass medical MMJ for possible crohn's pain management...

9352 2018-11-07 05:16:27 Franny Lee used to do that every week.

He was before the oil by the way, so you will need to Google his name.
9353 2018-11-07 05:16:27 Thank goodness. Our oil and gas jobs get to stay and so do all the jobs that depend on them & funding can stand on more solid footing, We get to continue using our natural resources responsibly instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

9355 2018-11-07 05:16:13 $31+ million raised mostly by big oil industry to defeat Indigenous-led WA Initiative 1631 to fine big oil for their refinery emissions.

like when $24+ million raised by big chem (including Monsanto) to defeat WA Initiative 522 that tried to require GMO labels.

9359 2018-11-07 05:15:40 He won’t let you help, Beto. He doesn’t even show up to vote half the time. All he does is take oil money and vote the way they and the gun people tell him to. RUN FOR CORNYN’S SEAT IN 2020 IF YOU’RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE. #Beto2020

9387 2018-11-07 05:12:04 Not even a point now in fighting for Cruz lmao. Beto blew it. Texas people knew he was a fraud. He lost a lot of support from minority voters and middle class voters after he stated his position on the oil industry, which is a large part of both voting groups. Idiot
9388 2018-11-07 05:11:35 The good news is we're sending Kendra Horn to the house. 
The bad news is too many of us think inexperience is a good thing and that education doesn't matter. Or sick poor people. Or old people. Or anyone outside the oil & gas industry.

9391 2018-11-07 05:11:12 Everyone who fought for #yeson1631 deserves huge credit. Big Oil had to break every spending record in Washington to narrowly beat this carbon tax. All respect!
9392 2018-11-07 05:11:06 And now we get to prosecute his campaign for finance violations!  Beto truly is the gift that keeps on giving.

9398 2018-11-07 05:10:44 Washington seems on the brink of voting no on extremely necessary pollution taxes opposed almost exclusively by oil company surrogates and yes on ill-conceived gun regulations. Remains a state with deeply conflicted priorities.
9399 2018-11-07 05:10:36 I live in a state/house district that reliably vote Democratic. Still pissed though--Washington #Proposition1631 going down to defeat. Curse you, oil companies! The amount of money poured into the anti-campaign  was tremendous.

9423 2018-11-07 05:06:49 One might be truly amazed how the Koch Brothers money can sway so many votes after a lackluster campaign. The oil and gas lobby bought a valuable Senate seat tonight. Must protect all those EPA deregulations. Follow the $$

9437 2018-11-07 05:05:05 Yeah you can take your car in for a $40 oil change, but I dont trust the rando in the pit at jiffylube to service my vehicle. I spend more just in parts doing it myself, but that way I know it was done correctly the first time.

9444 2018-11-07 05:03:58 Jumping from 500 to 2500? You’re not even thinking about the people that own land in rural Colorado that drill on their own property 1000 feet from their home. 

Did they waste their life savings? Is their land worthless now? 

This law almost eliminates oil in CO.
9445 2018-11-07 05:03:46 MI democrats anyway.
9446 2018-11-07 05:03:45 Also banning offshore oil drilling and greyhound racing is pretty great and made me very happy.
9447 2018-11-07 05:03:42 That is a mere pittance in relation to the amount of money spent by oil/gas companies in AB/SK to protect the wildlife and environment that may otherwise be affected by their work.

9450 2018-11-07 05:03:18 One way to test hypotheses is called elegance. Does it, if true, fit with other things that are happening. For example, why is Russia so powerful? Even though their GDP is roughly equivalent to New York City. They have enough to oil swing the markets.

9461 2018-11-07 05:02:34 Things I learned about Colorado tonight: they love their big oil and gas (), still really hate taxes () but for whatever reason are cool voting in a Democratic, openly gay governor (). I’m good with that I guess 
9462 2018-11-07 05:02:19 True. But taxing them doesn’t fix the issue. The oil companies just make us pay for it, and the government is laughing all the way to the back. We need to do more positive reinforcment. As in LESS taxes for being clean. Not more taxes for polluting.
9463 2018-11-07 05:02:19 Another reason not to vote for him. Just because he’s a smooth talker doesn’t mean crap. I could probably sell snake oil to most Democrat’s.
9464 2018-11-07 05:02:16 why do they do that, it only adds oil to the fire
9465 2018-11-07 05:02:15 FLORIDUH ! The oil rigs on the beach are lining up. Two Republican Senators and now a Republican Governor. I blame the Damn Yankees who have moved here to end their lives at the Villages and such. They don't give a damn about the environment or this state.

9472 2018-11-07 05:00:50 Burning natural gas still produces CO2. It's a hydrocarbon after all.
Only difference it has with oil is that it produces lesser visible pollutants but almost the same amount of greenhouse gases.

9478 2018-11-07 05:00:30 But isn’t all the othe Christian values like no sex before marriage, don’t eat pork, etc. the same as do your oil changes, change your breaks, etc.? Not a religious person but I do see how they believe both
9479 2018-11-07 05:00:23 The oil & gas industry spent $30 million to kill #YesOn1631, the climate-justice initiative in Washington

9490 2018-11-07 04:59:36 China is not going to give up our factories bc they are already working with Trump on limiting their oil purchases from Iran.  This compromise from China was not for us.

9497 2018-11-07 04:59:13 Despite #AndreGuillm losing a tough race tonight, it was still a pretty good night for #Florida: 

We said no to the unwanted Homestead Exemption Increase 

We restore ex-felon voting rights 

We ending Greyhound Dog racing

Banned Oil Drilling off our coast.
9498 2018-11-07 04:59:01 Guess who else won in a Florida...Red Algae...and Oil rigs...and going underwater in 25-30 years...
9499 2018-11-07 04:58:53 honestly fam, what do we gain from texas? oil. okay. but florida? mosquitos and jean shorts?
9500 2018-11-07 04:58:39 Florida voted to end dog racing and keep taxes on the wealthy and on property low 

Also ban oil drilling and vaping indoors lol, im fine with that
9501 2018-11-07 04:58:36 We are glad to know that you are following the discussions on the oil sector on such platforms! Keep it up @ernest_asiimwe
9502 2018-11-07 04:58:35 I don’t think it matters what side controlled. Either way the Great War would still have happened. They make $ from oil yes but they didn’t go looking for more because they wanted more $. It’s just the world running out of oil. Say the left ruled u still would have ran out.

9507 2018-11-07 04:57:48 @TXsharon so sad...Colorado's Proposition 112, which would've expanded setbacks for oil and gas drilling to 2,500 feet, has failed. The frackers spent $30 million to defeat it!!!!!!!!!!
9508 2018-11-07 04:57:38 I'm actually much too sick to take care of anyone let alone anyone as much of a trainwreck as balloonmaker Okada but let me. please. let me give him some hair treatment oil at least

9511 2018-11-07 04:57:17 All this time China was doing huge favors for Trump limiting their Oil purchases from Iran.
This is a huge favor, we will pay for this favor.  But we didn't need the favor.  See how this works.  We lose all the time to protect our ally.

9515 2018-11-07 04:57:07 Is there scarcity now? We had the worst scarcity before 2015 when oil scarcity was a lucrative business. Oil marketers collected subsidy for non imported oil.
9516 2018-11-07 04:57:04 You could try vaping cannabis oil. It heals insides if lungs. My cousin gas asbestos related copd. He grows and makes his own oils. I hit leaves you laughing and couchbound.

9525 2018-11-07 04:56:07 Proposition 112, the Colorado ballot initiative that would have increased oil & gas drilling setbacks from homes, businesses & waterways, was defeated following a contentious campaign in which the industry spent tens of millions of dollars to defeat the measure #Election #Climate
9526 2018-11-07 04:56:06 I put vitamin E oil on my scars and laid on my bed on my light grey sheets and now there’s oil on them rip me
9527 2018-11-07 04:55:56 Just oil
9528 2018-11-07 04:55:45 Colorado just elected a Governor who supports 100% renewable energy and, despite Big Oil flooding the state with $40 million in advertising, over 700,000 people voted for fracking setbacks. 

The fossil fuel industry should be very, very worried.
9529 2018-11-07 04:55:43 Voted, did laundry (including sheets and bedding), got an oil change and got 4 pieces of wood painted today. I’m getting good at this “adulting” thing
9530 2018-11-07 04:55:40 I’m a big fan of Shea Moisture skin care products. I’m currently using the 100% Virgin Coconut Oil products. Available at all major retailers.
9531 2018-11-07 04:55:37 Btw you sell the pens with the oil ?

9535 2018-11-07 04:55:13 Well there’s always industrial hemp. I heard that CBD oil is like a miracle cure for pretty much anything.


9536 2018-11-07 04:55:10 Game changer! Man is a visionary! Building own port, roads, just to see his dream through for the largest oil refinery in the world!
9537 2018-11-07 04:55:08 How many weeks are you? Has anyone ever recommended castor oil to induce your labor? Jaybrio’s mom & aunties swear by it, but only recommend it to those that are at least 39wks & not high risk. They drank 1oz castor oil with a lot of sunny d & went into labor the same day.

9539 2018-11-07 04:54:41 He can win in Texas. Possibly the only income generating state in the nation that will have him. Better not run out of oil or try for a another national campaign. We are not all as ignorant as a Texas white women.
9540 2018-11-07 04:54:34 But he was for raising taxes, ruining insurance companies, and higher taxes & restrictions on oil. F your feelings let’s make $

9543 2018-11-07 04:54:02 - in part : Need to curb corporate behavior, end oil industry. Big government to effect planetary change. People love money more than earth. Corporations won’t change behavior willingly. And we have only ten years.

9546 2018-11-07 04:53:30 Yes campaign didn’t really make this about the climate crisis, didn’t go on offense, waited too long to respond to oil company funded lies. Hard when you’re outspent though.
9547 2018-11-07 04:53:27 Was (once again) reading up on oil differentials. Sad to see that we are selling our product so cheap (vs. world prices), BUT not even to ourselves. We sell it to Americans and then reimport it or buy Saudi/ Nigerian oil to feed the demand out east. This makes literally no sense
9548 2018-11-07 04:53:26 mix it with another type of oil like coconut or olive oil and wipe it off after applying DO NOT USE IT IF YOU HAVE A DOG

9550 2018-11-07 04:53:18 CBD oil is a godsend. What anxiety?
9551 2018-11-07 04:53:15 I ducked out early to hang with the book club where we talked about class struggle in post war Alberta after oil was discovered.
9552 2018-11-07 04:53:15 It is very unfortunate that Government on side happy on KSA defferred oil payments, but clueless how they will pay 1st installment after second quarter...
9553 2018-11-07 04:53:10 I mix it with 2 other clays and it’s an oil based mud mask the first one was a bit dry cause it was water based 
9554 2018-11-07 04:52:46 I want to know how many blacks are eligible to vote. Cus there are mad African and carribean immigrants in Texas because of oil and gas. That plays into the population but they can't vote.
9555 2018-11-07 04:52:45 He lost narrowly in oil rich red Texas. He needs to move north.
9556 2018-11-07 04:52:38 I mean when I get insurance for my home, I consider the worst case scenario where the house burns down. So if I think about insurance for the oil and gas house why wouldn't I consider that burning down as the AER has done? So much denial in this world. So silly. Procrastination.
9557 2018-11-07 04:52:32 @Yvette4congress Oil and ranchers pay for a crook to win! Another loss for NM!
9558 2018-11-07 04:52:12 my passion burns like an oil spill after seeing this
9559 2018-11-07 04:52:11 I dont smoke, I dont care to. I DO wish I could use CBD oil for aches/pain but I cant risk it because of work. I read it doesnt have measurable THC but I cant take that chance.
9560 2018-11-07 04:52:04 Well, I’d say the present one doesn’t believe in the EXISTENCE of science except as it relates to oil refinement and profit maximization so that’s a step up.
9561 2018-11-07 04:52:02 Keep Oil In Your Lamp - The Mississippi Mass Choir
9562 2018-11-07 04:51:58 at first it will be a pain in the ass but it’s spacing out the washes as long as you can and keeping that regimen until ur hair gets used it. when you wash it too often, the hair actually dries from all the damage of hot water heat etc so it produces MORE oil to keep it healthy
9563 2018-11-07 04:51:47 熱が出そうな体のだるさですねまだ一応体は動きますが…

9566 2018-11-07 04:51:32 Hardcore Texan Republicans think in terms of oil and Christianity. The fact that this was close is HUGE. 

Don’t worry. Things are changing here. Old white guys are not our future. 

We know we lost something great, and it won’t happen again.
9567 2018-11-07 04:51:19 Is this a picture or an oil on canvas masterpiece???
9568 2018-11-07 04:51:15 これはずるい
9569 2018-11-07 04:51:12 Colorado lost our battle against big oil. And we were only seeking set backs not bans on fracking . Happy for FL’s environmental wins though.
9570 2018-11-07 04:51:12 has tremendous power over the US. Kirkuk, Iraq is the last large reserve of easy-to-drill oil. IS got, and stayed, too close. US could not negotiate with them. They gave up their red lines because they feared Assad would fall and they would lose "regional security."

9576 2018-11-07 04:50:01 Florida said today:
We enjoy rising sea levels flooding our streets.
We like banning use ‘climate change’ in our govt.
We like gun violence in our schools.
We enjoy racism despite our incredibly diverse population.
We welcome more oil spills near our waters & more algae problems.
9577 2018-11-07 04:49:55 @AndrewGillum ~ great concession speech.  Love the part having your mom put on your forehead oil ~ anointed[ing] with the sign of the cross.
9578 2018-11-07 04:49:54 Still no reply from a political twitter account with 11k followers? 

I mean seriously - what about oil production within 2500ft of a building do they not want for their kids?

Not a complicated question

9582 2018-11-07 04:49:27 Sadly Washington State was overwhelmed by the big Texas oil industry campaign against our clean environmental initiative. Next time we will know how to fight these wealthy oil barons. Koch brothers will be pushed out of the Evergreen State!

9586 2018-11-07 04:49:05 Did you mean Amendment 73? Amendment 74 was regarding land owners being compensated for property devaluation/right to sue re: oil and gas location.
9587 2018-11-07 04:49:01 He releases a powerful stinky oil from glands on the edges of his shell. He doesn’t like to be picked him up, and I respect him for it.
9588 2018-11-07 04:48:59 He's been granting waivers to the countries America has friendly relations with so Irans oil exports are not going down to zero anytime soon.
9589 2018-11-07 04:48:42 Fucking oil money.... fuck them so much.
9590 2018-11-07 04:48:38 what's happening you ask @Twitter ?  I made Blueberry Muffins with sour cream, added coconut and chocolate chips, real butter rather than the oil called for and condensed milk rather than milk. Let me say......they are good.  Night Tweeps !!!!!!
9591 2018-11-07 04:48:29 Also without oil and gas, the economy doesn’t keep chugging in Colorado. Which means the housing industry doesn’t keep growing. It’s wasn’t solar that was driving the economy in 2008.
9592 2018-11-07 04:48:26 Other good Florida news besides Amendment 4 and the oil drilling ban: Transit taxes passed in Broward, Hillsborough, and Saint Lucie counties!
9593 2018-11-07 04:48:24 Be fair.  He schmoozed with oil executives.
9594 2018-11-07 04:48:10 Here's a hypothesis: The US has many trillions of dollars in hard, fixed, assets that depend on liquid fuel. Highways, suburbs, DIY stores, pipelines, refineries, tankers, gas stations, even subways that make more room for cars. Anyone who controls oil market ... more
9595 2018-11-07 04:48:06 Some of NM friends were bragging about being trump supporters- so be it.  At least the State Land Commissioner is a professional experienced NON-OIL lackey who will sincerely protect public land, water and oil.
9596 2018-11-07 04:48:05 CBD is the active ingredient in the cannabis oil that helps your son. I'm glad he's doing well, but don't promote a dangerous mix of chemicals when one harmless one on its own -- the CBD -- will do.
9597 2018-11-07 04:48:03 florida let me down but also florida banned off shore oil drilling and dog racing so thank god

9599 2018-11-07 04:48:00 112 being defeated isn’t surprising just incredibly disappointing. Feels like the oil and gas industry can easily con my home state while actively working to destroy the natural beauty that so many love. In 20 years won’t we look back and regret not limiting their presence? Ugh

9601 2018-11-07 04:47:58 Y'all knew Cruz was gn win, Cruz come from Oil money..and what you think is in Texas...
9602 2018-11-07 04:47:56 ABSOFREAKIN’LUTELY!
9603 2018-11-07 04:47:51 If Amendment 9 doesnt pass I hope you all die from jules and oil in our oceans
9604 2018-11-07 04:47:43 Let's see if Lizzie actually votes with the Dems on anything like that. Her oil company sponsors won't like it much.
9605 2018-11-07 04:47:40 1. The NRA won.
2. Big pharma won.
3. Oil and gas corporations won.
4. Californians donated $587,000 for Cruz campaign, from June 2, 2017- June 30, 2018. 8% of $7.4 million contributions. 
5. The people of Texas lost—-healthcare, college tuition, stuck on $7.25 minimum wage..
9606 2018-11-07 04:47:22 There Is Nothing Like The Smell Of Fresh Garlic, Fresh Basil, & Olive Oil Cooking In My House!!..Even If It Is At 8:45p!!!
9607 2018-11-07 04:47:09 わいのシンメは持ってる
9608 2018-11-07 04:47:06 We didn't all vote for that lowlife, but this a oil and gas State, and it us Red. We tried but Beto will run in 2020 and I believe he will win. Signed Crystals mom
9609 2018-11-07 04:47:02 Snake oil
9610 2018-11-07 04:46:59 I’ve got a couple more years till I retire and leave this shitshow! Don’t visit here! You’ll be swimming in red tide, taking boat rides by oil platforms, the ever shrinking Everglades will be nearly gone!
9611 2018-11-07 04:46:54 Nothing special today because i did my aha/bh peel already this week. just cleanser, followed by Alpha Arbutin, aloe and moisturizer and borage oil. Most definitely have to go skincare shopping this weekend!
9612 2018-11-07 04:46:45 A washcloth!!!! Omg! Maybe try a cotton round with a cleansing balm! Farmacy makes a great one. He’ll use coconut oil.
9613 2018-11-07 04:46:39 I get your point. But oil and gas makes up a large chunk of the economy. Can’t replace that with “solar”.....
9614 2018-11-07 04:46:37 But it's just so perfect. Manatees need to swim in oil and can't nobody make me vape outside!
9615 2018-11-07 04:46:23 Took $40m of funding from oil and gas to do it....
9616 2018-11-07 04:46:20 I hope they get around to investigating you.  You are meaningless.  Snake oil salesman.
9617 2018-11-07 04:46:16 MERALCO: Lower oil prices is good news for electricity users. Malampaya natural gas is pegged on world crude prices. 60% of Meralco's supply comes from natural gas-run plants. But the reflection of price changes has a lag time or delay of 6 months.
9618 2018-11-07 04:46:13 Not interested in burning any systems down. When you’ve invested your life savings in a good car, you don’t set fire to it if you’ve forgotten to change the oil.

And - with respect, the suggestion that both parties “share the same values” is absurd - especially re: gun control.
9619 2018-11-07 04:46:00 ボイス全然把握してないんで完全に見た目の好みなんですけど、良いですよね…
9620 2018-11-07 04:45:48 I agree Jasen! As rigged as an oil rig! #bluewave
9621 2018-11-07 04:45:37 thats why i had to burn more oil 
9622 2018-11-07 04:45:32 冒頭が引き込まれますね
9623 2018-11-07 04:45:25 I've been too nervous to follow the elections, but being an emotional pastry cook, I made a chocolate olive oil layer cake with apricot balsamic jam filling and bittersweet chocolate ganache. All from scratch including the jam and chocolate without a recipe. #ElectionNightNerves
9624 2018-11-07 04:45:21 @Ha2936 Miles,and miles of sun baked sand . .More sun, that oil on hand.
9625 2018-11-07 04:45:17 Hope the next pot measure up for voting has it worded to have OIL in all caps written in it. Then maybe it will pass.
9626 2018-11-07 04:45:17 Oil companies spent BIG. Oh well. Breathable air is overrated.
9627 2018-11-07 04:45:16 Those red counties just be population: 750. Ain’t nothing out there but windmills, oil wells, cattle, and a handful of people.
9628 2018-11-07 04:45:07 Have you tried making it in a cast iron skillet? I heat the skillet with little oil for 20 minutes and then pour the batter in - cook for a few minutes less than the instructions. The hot oil/pan gives the cornbread an amazing crunchy bottom/side crust!
9629 2018-11-07 04:45:03 My one, and probably only comment on the Election in Washington State: 

You can’t run an initiative against big oil by primarily targeting King County voters and expect to win. You need the whole state to understand why it is a good thing. More boots on the ground and town halls
9630 2018-11-07 04:45:01 I rub the balm on the area that hurts and I ingest the oil. Combination of both and lawddd its really helped with the nerve pain and anxiety.
9631 2018-11-07 04:45:00 #texas #dems of you don't understand the power of #oil and #cocaine and #rural #suburbia I hope you understand now.
9632 2018-11-07 04:44:54 I hear ya big Time! Buy water packed people and then dump your own olive oil on it. Consider this a public service announcement.
9633 2018-11-07 04:44:50 I’ll pay for his oil change 
9634 2018-11-07 04:44:44 Or snake oil...perhaps?
9635 2018-11-07 04:44:43 Gingelly Oil is Minyak Bijan.

9636 2018-11-07 04:44:41 Tea tree oil really a blessing
9637 2018-11-07 04:44:39 It made me sad I couldn't vote for him (as I live in a different state)
9638 2018-11-07 04:44:35 Tampa is the best team in the league. The oil put up good fight. Some of these so called 'fans' are way too hard on the team.
9639 2018-11-07 04:44:34 Yes, it’s “Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and misdemeanors”.  But I suspect that Dems, who saw what happened to senators who voted against Kavanaugh, will restrain the loons like Maxine Waters.  And absolutely no way R Senate will convict POTUS!
9640 2018-11-07 04:44:28 But I will be taking full advantage of the fact I can go to shops and get various cbd oil products instead of ordering it all online 
9641 2018-11-07 04:44:22 The guy I buy my CBD oil from is named Ricochet and it's actually a CBD slash fireworks store and I just...it's a strange time, y'all. But CBD really does wonders for my anxiety-induced insomnia sooo hello Ricochet, thank you for your service.
9642 2018-11-07 04:44:17 Not sure if I am drunk to celebrate or drown my sorrows. On one hand, my state just elected the first gay governor - fuck yeah. On the other, I guess there is no point in worrying about the oil sites next to the school that we can’t afford to be build. #progressaslongasitsfree:(
9643 2018-11-07 04:44:15 Oil Change on one of my vehicles today, they gave me 2mo free of Sirius XM Radio!! Really, well I only listen to Talk Radio, some gospel stations.. My Playlist on my Smart Phone keeps me very much, entertained

9646 2018-11-07 04:43:48 Both sides fought you and will continue to battle you for the oil tycoons.
9647 2018-11-07 04:43:41 Flaxseed: look at me, I can be turned into oil.

Other plants: Weird flax, but ok
9648 2018-11-07 04:43:40 The Witcher:
It was a windy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about big Boars. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
9649 2018-11-07 04:43:40 Stitt spent 5 million of his own $, plus he had the support of all the oil/energy companies! The rich against the poor

9653 2018-11-07 04:43:25 He's getting older and the gland that exudes his charisma is breaking down.

Now, it just exudes a vegetable oil.

It's kind of sad.
9654 2018-11-07 04:43:24 I firmly believe that in the next two to four years Oklahoma will look up and realize that all it's capable people have left. And that all they have are prisons full of poor people and abandoned oil wells.
9655 2018-11-07 04:43:22 I want to give a try...from a oil and gas engineer to radio geek..
9656 2018-11-07 04:43:19 Alyssa the brokerage clerk jogs to bottle of oil and humiliate it
9657 2018-11-07 04:43:06 @rigup how can I get one of the “Make oil and gas great again” hats?!? Need!!!! Thanks!
9658 2018-11-07 04:43:03 It’s the oil people. All those jobs in fracking. I read they are all voting for Republicans bc they think they’ll lose their jobs.Oil is God in Tx.
9659 2018-11-07 04:42:50 There are Texans who could care less about future generations & the planet.  It’s just the oil.
9660 2018-11-07 04:42:50 when i shower i use a lot of conditioner and then let it sit before rinsing it out. when i get out i put coconut oil in it and dont brush it it’ll my hair air dries. idk what not brushing it does i feel like my hair is just softer
9661 2018-11-07 04:42:47 Might go work in an oil field next year , 70k a year starting at 21 I should definitely be able to retire at 40. Ik the oil industry hella inconsistent tho
9662 2018-11-07 04:42:46 Thems the rules
9663 2018-11-07 04:42:43 Oil pricing is going to collapse. This is coming coming New World Order
9664 2018-11-07 04:42:27 正解です
9665 2018-11-07 04:42:19 I noticed!! this is a tough one!! whichever doesn’t have palm oil works for me! 
9666 2018-11-07 04:42:06 feelin’ chill and happy and comfortable in my body on this new moon, i bought ylang ylang oil dammit
9667 2018-11-07 04:41:56 You know how people say, “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed”? Yeah, nope I’m both. What the actual fuck, Oklahoma?!? Guess Oil and Gas matter way more than children and education...swell. #scaredandstupid #newstatemotto #oklahomaisnotok
9668 2018-11-07 04:41:52 Grateful for roommates like @xKRAYneC 
They oil your scalp and twist it up for you 
9669 2018-11-07 04:41:51 Urgh... I need food but I feel so sick now lol yet I'm hungry. I hate pain meds make CBD oil accessible
9670 2018-11-07 04:41:50 You can thank Oblama for the oil spill clean up or lack of a clean up. How quickly you dems forget lol.
9671 2018-11-07 04:41:47 Bukan krim atau salep sih, katanya bio oil juga bagus buat hilangin bekas luka. Lucas pawpaw juga bagus
9672 2018-11-07 04:41:37 The country was either always great or never great (depending on who you talk to) but nothing’s changed, Trump didn’t make any changes to address addiction, Nor did he change the war against ISIS, what pedophiles do you speak of? You’re being sold snake oil...
9673 2018-11-07 04:41:33 One thing that does help a little, re Florida--we passed an amendment today banning fracking and offshore oil drilling. This at least means environmental activism should be able to focus on fighting other things.
9674 2018-11-07 04:41:18 I had a man offer to help me change my oil to save money. I’d take the offer but he’s been one of those “nice guys” before so I feel like it’s a trap.
9675 2018-11-07 04:41:17 That's what u think file a RTI n find out Who got the contract for 3lakhs lamps n oil and did the contractor buy it from poor locals ? I did not say anything about the lamps n oil. instead of solving the real issues  govt is busy doing Nautanki on public money  that's my problem
9676 2018-11-07 04:41:13 To all of you crying that Beto lost... If you want a democratic senator, move to a democratic state.  That simple.  Texas will always be about the oil.  If you try to do something to stop or slow down big oil, you are not going to make it in Texas.
9677 2018-11-07 04:41:08 No Ryan. He’s actually quite smart.  Did you read about what he @peterboghossian & @HPluckrose did?  They exposed “scholarship” for the herbal snake oil that is is.  

As an ex-religious person you should appreciate that they’re trying to actually expose BS.
9678 2018-11-07 04:41:03 It isn't hilarious. It was a horrible way to manipulate people. (If you don't want offshore oil drilling, you can't have indoor vaping).
9679 2018-11-07 04:40:54 Apparently we love our oil money and “family values” as much as we hate the evil brown caravan invasion... Ugh, so sorry, y’all!
9680 2018-11-07 04:40:40 Gabapentin is the devil!  Talk to me!  CBD OIL is a much safer option!  CTFO has a new product, 10xPure 500 mg and 1500 mg, with patented processing and exclusive to CTFO.  Send me a message!
9681 2018-11-07 04:40:27 Dada wa taifa amepanic  amefeli hakuna jipya leo kwake konki master ni oil chafuuu mwamba  
9682 2018-11-07 04:40:27 It was probably lumped together to dissuade people from voting for it but it did not work cause fuck oil companies and fuck offshore drilling
9683 2018-11-07 04:40:25 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
9684 2018-11-07 04:40:24 People here are mean. And Fox News is on everywhere. Whether you are waiting in a doctor’s office, or for an oil change, if there’s a TV on, it’s tuned to Fox.
9685 2018-11-07 04:40:21 Weird you literally just called me and asked me to help you change your oil???
9686 2018-11-07 04:40:06 I get to keep my oil field job #Cruz
9687 2018-11-07 04:40:04 CBD oil is true magic. It has helped my anxiety like crazy. I am so thankful.
9688 2018-11-07 04:39:57 1631 is going to fail. All you Washington NIMBYs just sided with conservatives and big oil. You know that, right?
9689 2018-11-07 04:39:55 わかりみがすぎる
9690 2018-11-07 04:39:53 WHYYYYYY is the carbon and oil spill tax not going through!!!
9691 2018-11-07 04:39:46 So Mary Fallin was the most despised Governor in the USA, Oklahoma has fallen behind in healthcare, education, mental health care, and infrastructure for the past 8 years while big pharma and big oil line their pockets.  Today we said "yeah we're ok with that".
9692 2018-11-07 04:39:42 i betcha jimin gives really good massages, just give him some baby oil and his little fingers will make you feel nothing but bliss
9693 2018-11-07 04:39:34 By 2028 they'll have outlawed oil drilling and instituted a 9% state income tax. 2030 Toyota has to look for another HQ once again. Don't sell you surfboard sonny.
9694 2018-11-07 04:39:33 That is a good move considering air force. Now they will get real job of flying .  Flying with Indian currency. Lol. Looking at the rupees value, it will be one cargo for some barrel of oil. 

Lol. Such a bad time.
9695 2018-11-07 04:39:25 とりあえず今回のイベは6000位以内に入れるようにがんばります
9696 2018-11-07 04:39:24 Pure coconut oil . It works but i think it’s the weather making it worse
9697 2018-11-07 04:39:20 It’s late where I am but I can’t go to bed!  I have to read all 20 million responses to your stupidity!  America ain’t buying that snake oil you and your fake a#^£< children are selling!  Suit up big boy....it’s about to get hot! And we all know that you ain’t built 4 this!
9698 2018-11-07 04:39:12 Yo girl step fresh out the shower. You watch her start rubbing oil on her body, wyd??
9699 2018-11-07 04:39:08 My face broke out in a bright red rash thanks to Wild Growth oil I’m pissed
9700 2018-11-07 04:39:05 Well you can look at his taxes, while I'm looking at, lowest black, Latino, youth, women unemployment in history, strongest military ever, energy independent the largest oil producer, and so on and so on....
9701 2018-11-07 04:38:55 Mona,  my son Joey does coconut oil also every day but i cant remember what he said about health benefits.  I also eat a couple apples every day, seeds and all.
9702 2018-11-07 04:38:54 Remember Bill Clinton gave them cause and still remained in office. Only 2 Presidents have been impeached, both Democrats, and neither was removed.

9704 2018-11-07 04:38:37 There's a local politician on tv wearing a hat that says "make oil and gas great again" just in case you were wondering why Texas ended up the way it did.
9705 2018-11-07 04:38:35 Just laid down some coconut oil on my scalp this already feel crazy
9706 2018-11-07 04:38:15 People are the problem. Not oil and gas. That’s my point. No matter the industry people will be selfish and do what’s best for them and not the planet. So why take money from our state when it’s going to happen anyway?
9707 2018-11-07 04:38:08 thats okay.... you and everybody at channel 2 news gon smell that mid-night oil by tomorrow! my fella!
9708 2018-11-07 04:37:59 Debating between doing my Charcoal peppermint oil mask or making this new Avocado seed mask
9709 2018-11-07 04:37:49 Jerk. I wonder what color he'll be turning the waters in FL. Perhaps a nice poop brown this time, with lots of dead zones in the Gulf so the coastal residents won't care anymore when he signs permits for offshore oil derrick construction in view of the mansions.
9710 2018-11-07 04:37:37 I’m not saying some things that are happening aren’t hurting the environment. It’s the way they are doing it. The industry isn’t harmful to quality of life unless a catastrophe happens like the oil spills. But the practices of the companies may be hurting. Not my point tho
9711 2018-11-07 04:37:33 تسلم ربنا يخليك
9712 2018-11-07 04:37:33 You really think that we can just go away from using oil and gas. Our economy and everybody else’s in the world will literally stall. It would cost hundreds of trillions.
9713 2018-11-07 04:37:27 이렇게 오글거리는 생각만 하는 내가 짜증나 시바,;;;
9714 2018-11-07 04:37:27 My point is smoking blunts is not healthy for ur developing child ? If ur not supposed to smoke cigarettes while pregnant why smoke blunts ???? They are filled with nicotine and can be just as bad ? Nothing wrong with cbd oil .
9715 2018-11-07 04:36:59 say what y’all want but ted was for the oil field and im all for that
9716 2018-11-07 04:36:50 今回のストに関してはとりあえず感想を漁りまくっている
9717 2018-11-07 04:36:44 It’s a shame, James is a great candidate.
9718 2018-11-07 04:36:39 Im happy about this flip but we still elected a republican governor who will only conrinue to ignore our most pressing issues to kiss the ass of big oil
9719 2018-11-07 04:36:12 The crazy thing is that almost every person in the industry I talked to said this did almost nothing for safety and was 100% against the oil industry. My step brother said that if this passed they would have had to lay off 90% of their staff. Oil saved Colorado in the recession.
9720 2018-11-07 04:36:10 NB...Irving Oil would buy all Alberta oil if a pipeline is built. Nope instead they buy from Saudi. How the fuck does that make sense mr carbon tax? Do you think Canadians are dumb. Hopefully not a 2nd time.
9721 2018-11-07 04:36:09 COLORADO REJECTS OIL, GAS DRILLING LIMITS NEAR SOME AREAS: AP
9722 2018-11-07 04:36:05 Unfortunately, cause is anything they want.  It’s a political process, but they need to make political calculation.  If they miscalculate, they will lose...

9724 2018-11-07 04:35:57 What would work in most areas, except for oil field workers.
9725 2018-11-07 04:35:50 Has he really reduced himself to a much more obvious snake oil salesman?

9728 2018-11-07 04:35:35 Hi @RepPeteOlson,
 Where can I get one of those “Make Oil & Gas Great Again” hats you’re wearing? 
Thanks in advance 
9729 2018-11-07 04:35:30 Watching the WA state results and literally the 2 things on the ballot for protecting the environment (carbon emission and maintaining funds for oil spills) are flopping. So what happened to our nature loving attitude WA? It’s not over yet but it’s not looking good
9730 2018-11-07 04:35:25 that "Mid-Night oil is burning baby! 
Uncle Hosea is looking down and saying,

9733 2018-11-07 04:34:51 Good to know oil and soda companies can have such great influence on our state...

9735 2018-11-07 04:34:47 선의가 자꾸 거절되면 포기하는 법이고 애들도 똑같을 거야
9736 2018-11-07 04:34:33 Tonight I’m thankful for: hot oil treatments with Kinsley, dancing to “you’re a good good father” with Karagan, and parents who have so much love that they find others to share it with too. I’m so blessed.
9737 2018-11-07 04:34:30 Don't feel bad.  With all the regulations being removed, the water and land is already being poisoned plenty fast by Big Oil. Texas voters drink their tainted well water and vote to keep idiots like Ted in.  Gotta get more young people to vote and cancel old white men's vote out.

9739 2018-11-07 04:34:26 namjoon would spit on you bc everything he stands for goes directly against any republican policy lmao and i can say whatever i want miss olive oil
9740 2018-11-07 04:34:25 I was thinking this morning about the oil and gas investment coming to Mozambique and I wondered how prepared are Mozambicans and the government.  Do you think they can fathom upwards of US$50b? How would this impact on their lives?
9741 2018-11-07 04:34:23 they cook everything in peanut oil

9743 2018-11-07 04:34:21 Oh perfect! So maybe, and hopefully, the conditioner should be all you need then. I literally buy human vitamin e capsules and give them to him with his feed lol. It seems to work great though. He gets about 1.5 cups oil/day. I just dump it and eyeball though.
9744 2018-11-07 04:34:20 애들은 내가 얼마나 어이없을까 걱정 해주는 것도 한두번이지 나중되면 날 짜증난다고 생각할 거임
9745 2018-11-07 04:34:11 Bingo! 
9746 2018-11-07 04:34:07 Except they just voted to allow felons to vote and to limit offshore oil drilling. It's simply a messed-up state. GOP won both gubernatorial and senate races by a point or so--in a great economy. #ElectionNight

9749 2018-11-07 04:33:38 I've been on the Aztec clay mask train this week mixing mine with apple cider vinegar & a few drops of grapeseed oil. No real opinions or results of course since it's only been a few days.
9750 2018-11-07 04:33:33 No, House can impeach with simple majority.  Senate needs to convict with 2/3s.  But if Dems try to impeach, assured Trump win.  When voters see Pelosi and Waters in charge...greatest advertising for Republicans!
9751 2018-11-07 04:33:33 So the ANC announces no fuel increase last month or so to appease the masses but now the ‘slate’ says we have under-recovered on fuel so there is an increase in diesel and paraffin this month when the oil price is down. We see you Cyril 
9752 2018-11-07 04:33:30 You and me both know that. we didnt lose the house yet (im sure we will) It aint over till the fat lady sings.
9753 2018-11-07 04:33:24 And what a great honor that would be

Remember - you can’t manufacture a Tesla or a Windmill without crude oil.

It is the most efficient energy source. Period. 

And #CO citizens recognize that

P.S - Future historians won’t write a damn thing about you 
9754 2018-11-07 04:33:24 (4/10) "The coordinator of the Washington diplomatic corps for the Republicans in Cleveland was Frank Mermoud, a former state department official involved in business ventures in Ukraine via Cub Energy, a Black Sea-focused oil and gas company of which he is a director.

9756 2018-11-07 04:33:17 Are you going to teach him how to lie down and take it like you did for our state? This state has gone to hell and just when you think you’ve hit bottom, you throw us a shovel. Adultery, oil & gas should be your next platform motto since you do it so well.
9757 2018-11-07 04:33:15 Why else would they have corporate sponsors who regularly have influences over things progressives oppose like the oil/gas industry, military industrial complex, etc.
9758 2018-11-07 04:33:15 “Guess what this liberal would be all about?   This liberal would be  about socializing … uh, umm.   … Would be about, basically, taking over,  and the government running all of your companies.” ( Waters to oil company executives )
9759 2018-11-07 04:33:05 Sad. But hey big oil and gas won...so there's that.

9761 2018-11-07 04:32:46 This morning i broke down crying and my mom walks away from me and the she comes back and hands me my cbd oil and says take some of this you seem stressed
9762 2018-11-07 04:32:41 You get your oil changed 
9763 2018-11-07 04:32:41 Meanwhile, I'm down 33 ticks on a #CL_F iron condor I have.
It's one point wide, and I still have 38DTE.
I need #oil above 65 for my short put spread to be OTM.
Let's see what happens. Oil has been getting murdered as of late.

9764 2018-11-07 04:32:31 Lol it is funny comparing the daily EU foods to Asian. Most of asian do not use butter anyway. That is why it is expensive here... and also we do not use olive oil. We just use coconut oil for deep frying xD

9767 2018-11-07 04:32:19 Also he is in no way "dependent" on us. Participating is a gift. Learning is a gift. It is a wonderful thing.

God is no more dependent on us than a parent who is a mechanic is dependent on their 10 year old to "help" them change the oil in the family car.

9771 2018-11-07 04:31:59 I truly don't know definitively since it's not my state and I haven't read more than a few passing things, but what I did read indicated there was oil influence to tie the two together in hopes of mobilizing folks to vote against it who otherwise likely would vote for.
9772 2018-11-07 04:31:58 Bc the only job affected by Betos politics is the oil rigs and refineries bc he wants to create more clean energy efficient jobs! He actually wants to help raise min wage to $15 so yalls loss 
9773 2018-11-07 04:31:56 Texas is the second largest oil producer in the world. If you kill oil in Texas you kill Texas itself. Right now renewable isn’t as cost effective as it seems but it is getting there it’s on its way It needs to be a gradual change not an immediate one where you destroy Texas Econ

9778 2018-11-07 04:31:40 Why oil prices. the economy is diversified, so, why not rice or beans,groundnut or even yam
9779 2018-11-07 04:31:33 Negative, the house need majority to impeach, senate needs 2/3 to convict.
9780 2018-11-07 04:31:28 1631 not looking great... Big oil money can do a lot of damage.
9781 2018-11-07 04:31:22 Wallace is starting to sound more and more like a rusty chain on a oil starved sprocket. Can’t stand the dude!
9782 2018-11-07 04:31:11 I think Midas is getting vitamin E too. I have to double check. How much oil do you give?
9783 2018-11-07 04:31:03 Not you, silly girl, the ones who elected her.
9784 2018-11-07 04:31:00 I am a South Indian Telugu.We celebrate Deepawali with pomp and show. We do Laxmi Devi Pooja, light diyas with oil,after burning the crackers we take sweets and later family dinner. It is full two days Festival for us.

9793 2018-11-07 04:30:09 And how smarmy Trump doppelgänger resorted to profoundly grotesque racism in order to create an oil spill sized plague of fear in his effort to do so. Right is might and the Dems will rule the day one battle at a time.
9794 2018-11-07 04:30:01 @AndrewGillum Lots of useless bullshit abt “olive oil, mama, & gran-mama!” YOU LOST! Know why? You are a freaking hypocrite. How could you claim Christianity but support MURDERING BABIES? Your mama didn’t teach you much! Should kick yr UGLY butt! LOSER!!
9795 2018-11-07 04:30:01 Lol House needs 2/3 to impeach.
9796 2018-11-07 04:30:00 It was like..... if rubbing alcohol and lavender oil had a baby that was thick and stuck to everything.
9797 2018-11-07 04:29:56 (Mike) Good deal. :) I rarely use the 100 count thin sleeves anymore. They are essentially a disposable product unless being used to sleeve cards that are handled very little. Finger oil and more quickly build up on those thin sleeves and cause sleeves to stick together.
9798 2018-11-07 04:29:45 They take oil $. HC even took gun $
9799 2018-11-07 04:29:32 IKR!  We are beyond repair! I want to move my grandchildren to where they will be given a chance in life. Oklahoma sucks for kids. Education is bottom of their elite fucking list. All they think is oil. 
9800 2018-11-07 04:29:29 Just put a few drops of lavender oil in my bedding laundry & I feel like a bitch with her whole ass life together
9801 2018-11-07 04:29:24 Did y’all notice he had no idea what his Grandmother’s anointing oil was? He said she got “her shiniest oil” “cooking oil...or the shiniest oil she had” & made a cross on his head. He didn’t know it was not rando oil. That bothered me
9802 2018-11-07 04:29:23 Exactly. There's sadly designed shapewear and then there are pretty, floaty silk undergarments simply meant to shield your clothes from body oil and provide both warmth and an adaptable lining.
9803 2018-11-07 04:29:21 You should look into getting a good oil and balm. It makes all the difference.
9804 2018-11-07 04:29:13 Mother fucker. Oil companies spent so much money on this campaign.  Signs everywhere.  There is a special place in hell for all of them.
9805 2018-11-07 04:29:11 Higher wages and lower oil prices mean more discretionary spending power. Hence rising demand and higher inflation
9806 2018-11-07 04:29:00 Snake oil salesman. And it is all in his hair.
9807 2018-11-07 04:28:54 I have a friend who’s at his victory party. She’s all about Cruz bc her hubby is in oil&gas and makes . She thinks Beto will kill the industry. All she cared about was her fucking lifestyle.
9808 2018-11-07 04:28:48 This was a tough one, I’m on the side of the the people with this one.  But I think there needs to be a little compromise.  Yes greater setbacks, maybe with some provisions that would allow oil to not entirely shut down or be as impactful.
9809 2018-11-07 04:28:46 I just made some box mac + cheese with garlic butter and sauteed bacon, red peppers, kale, brussel sprouts with roasted red pepper olive oil. I'm so proud of and had to let y'all know too
9810 2018-11-07 04:28:46 誠に申し訳ございません、、、OIL
9811 2018-11-07 04:28:43 Yeah, Melendez, quality dude...under multiple investigations. Alleged child molester. What were u thinking New Jersey.
9812 2018-11-07 04:28:42 Nah im on your side. No need for midol i was just sayin
9813 2018-11-07 04:28:41 Only a matter of time until the US dollar will no longer be used to pay for oil...
9814 2018-11-07 04:28:40 ketchup is prepared with tomatoes, sugar, vinegar/acetic acid and spices. It is used as a dressing or table condiment. Ketchup is cold and is never heated as a rule. Tomato sauce, on the other hand, is made from tomatoes, oil, meat or vegetable stock and spices.
9815 2018-11-07 04:28:37 it's a very good night for @ClimateHawkVote. We broke the power (sic) of the Climate 'Solutions' caucus by making the race about Carlos Curbelo's Big Oil money and ousting him in #Fl26.
9816 2018-11-07 04:28:32 I guess we may need to define who “they” are lol..we might be saying the same thing..

I thought you were saying that the Oil&Gas industry will never win the fight against those who support 112...and tonight #CO citizens won by rejecting 112
9817 2018-11-07 04:28:32 Konki konkii konkii master oil chafu 
9818 2018-11-07 04:28:30 Sup @Mitch_Rausch not a red neck here, just a hard working engineer for big oil. Hope that didn’t offend you.
9819 2018-11-07 04:28:28 No one is getting unemployed bc as I explained earlier there is enough oil for another 55 more years and our family members will be retired from the rigs by then
9820 2018-11-07 04:28:09 운동하셈
9821 2018-11-07 04:28:08 NO Really! the dems have talked about nationalizing the oil companies-the energy companies-what do U think happens when the government does this? The U.N. is looking forward to bringing in about 3-5 million immigrants from all around the world-watch some of the UNCHR meetings!
9822 2018-11-07 04:28:07 So, my enthusiasm for Texas has been eliminated with the re-election of Ted Cruz. The fact that a majority of people voted for this block of sour cheese and snake oil shows me they deserve this POS.
9823 2018-11-07 04:27:59 Also breathing in a veritable shit ton of lavender essentials oil vapors.
9824 2018-11-07 04:27:54 Yes, Texas will accept liars before they will vote against their oil industry!
9825 2018-11-07 04:27:41 좋아 일단 급식실에 적응을 해보자 이미 늦어서 급식은 못받음
9826 2018-11-07 04:27:32 2 oil changes in 3 months wasn’t adding up
9827 2018-11-07 04:27:28 I don't live in NY!
9828 2018-11-07 04:27:23 賽は投げられた！ぼよん。
9829 2018-11-07 04:27:09 Fucking paisas just cared about all the oil money. Bola de pendejos.
9830 2018-11-07 04:27:05 Bystander effect would imply that they would assume that someone else would come in to fix it, no? Also, most def. People get way too mad about shit though and assume that all good work is simple work. Snake oil salesmen in suits telling you 'this is the real fix!'
9831 2018-11-07 04:27:02 By oil and gas, that means the people who make a great living and enjoy their freedoms in Texas.
9832 2018-11-07 04:27:01 Texas is an oil state that is making sooooo much money from oil and tech companies. Voting Blue would've jeopardized incentives 4 more companies moving here because of increased taxes.
9833 2018-11-07 04:26:47 “Dictatorships...that transitioned into constitutional republics”?? Please do name some!
R u forgetting our role in S. and C. American countries where the disaster continues to this day (Caravan)?
As for Shah,he rode the oil hike of 70’s but had a negative budget for his last yr
9834 2018-11-07 04:26:38 He gives a really good speech. “His grandmama would put a vegetable oil cross on his forehead to protect him from the feds.” Rough translation...
9835 2018-11-07 04:26:35 yea so just give Team Kemp the keys to the Capitol.
there's ah old southern saying
my grand-mama would often say..
"boy,tonight we burning the mid-night oil"
9836 2018-11-07 04:26:35 Its just a big oil rig. 

We can put it near Galveston or something.
9837 2018-11-07 04:26:32 Shit taste like grass and oil 
9838 2018-11-07 04:26:30 Lindsay graham is like a snaked bathed in olive oil, sllipery and squirmy, a good friend of john mccain, really, with his head on trumps lap, sucking up his spite and hate, is this even real?
9839 2018-11-07 04:26:29 Long long way to go tho.  In January we see how his carbon tax will work and we'll see how much it will cost consumers.  He stopped on election reform and aboriginal rights.  But he did work out an oil deal and of course marijuana. :)
9840 2018-11-07 04:26:11 Hey @BrendanSchaub what CBD oil have you been taking?

9843 2018-11-07 04:26:04 Lizzie Fletcher’s district is a few blocks north of where I live but it’s awesome that a DEM WOMAN now represents one of the richest (oil $$$) areas of Houston and TX
9844 2018-11-07 04:25:47 Hope you have your previous tax returns in shoeboxes somewhere....

9850 2018-11-07 04:25:00 You gotta blame those in West Texas, the oil field workers that didn't vote.
9851 2018-11-07 04:24:55 Politicians live in a vacuum. It’s almost as is they are oblivious to what is happening, oil prices, unemployment...it doesn’t matter that they do work in portfolio committees, what they displayed inspires no confidence especially to the youth that looses hope daily.
9852 2018-11-07 04:24:49 i cannot believe indoor vaping and offshore oil drilling were lumped onto the same bill are you shitting me florida
9853 2018-11-07 04:24:41 High school hockey players and high school grads making 6 figures in oil and spending it all on prostitutes mostly.
9854 2018-11-07 04:24:40 Both states have let us down with NRA & oil money and voter suppression before 
9855 2018-11-07 04:24:39 The oil boom shall continue 
9856 2018-11-07 04:24:37 You need to stop giving taxpayer money to oil companies, Wall Street, Car Companies and even the NFL!  You repugs should put back all our money you put in your own pockets!
9857 2018-11-07 04:24:33 Energy Sec Cusi says govt expects another oil price rollback next week due to improving world market prices @Malaya_Online
9858 2018-11-07 04:24:33 Dear spiders and gagillapeeds I know that the temps are dropping and there was a ton of rain but if you enter my house you will either be sprayed with peppermint oil or you will develop a close relationship with the bottom of a shoe.

9860 2018-11-07 04:24:15 I’m honestly amazed at how broken Texas Republicans must be inside to re-elect that spineless snake oil pusher
9861 2018-11-07 04:24:14 Would that be the same Feinstein that had a Chinese spy driving her around for 20 years, listening to her classified conversations?
9862 2018-11-07 04:24:12 More like leave it to the oil companies to tie that vote to the offshore drilling in an attempt to defeat the other. Might have finished differently on its own.
9863 2018-11-07 04:24:05 Walk your ass everywhere and live outside if you hate oil and gas so much

9866 2018-11-07 04:23:52 So excited for legalized THC oil to become a thing in NYS.  Would have some kind of marker that's like "no medicinal effects, just fucks you right up"
9867 2018-11-07 04:23:46 Nice!

Wish Iowa could get so lucky.  It was hard enough getting cannabis oil for med use legalized here, and that was only fairly recently.
9868 2018-11-07 04:23:45 does anyone have any good remedies for getting rid of keloids?? i have a bad one on my nose & tea tree oil isn’t doing the trick!!!
9869 2018-11-07 04:23:43 New neighbours moved above me this week. How do I welcome them nicely but also tell them they need to oil their gerbil’s running wheel because I can hear it squeaking all the way in the basement!?!  #soannoying
9870 2018-11-07 04:23:38 You’re trying so hard old man. Keep pushing the snake oil.
9871 2018-11-07 04:23:35 I want to remind everyone that Ted Cruz is actually an iguana wearing an enchanted pair of cowboy boots loaned to him by an oil baron

9879 2018-11-07 04:23:00 I mean the Democrats ran a guy who wanted to ban semiautomatic weapons, open borders, and limit oil drilling... in Texas... Believe me if you want to win in Texas you need to find a candidate thats at least on the conservative left.
9880 2018-11-07 04:22:56 1.5 million Floridians will have their voting rights restored, though. And offshore oil drilling was banned.

2020 could be very good for us in Florida...

9882 2018-11-07 04:22:36 I really hope this black seed oil works
9883 2018-11-07 04:22:32 You sure that place is also changing the oil filter? They say they do, but most “quick lube” places don’t. Mark your filter.
9884 2018-11-07 04:22:19 But health care wont get trump oil or build hum a wall , war will .
9885 2018-11-07 04:22:15 Great to know are state is bought and paid for by the oil and gas industry.
9886 2018-11-07 04:22:06 Pardon?
9887 2018-11-07 04:22:05 EU or any other country has no connection with the GFA, Oil and water does nor mix, you can’t change that. Some things have no solution, unless perhaps Republic wants to leave the EU.

9890 2018-11-07 04:21:58 Amen to that, too. I’m not shocked but am still so upset about 112... The oil & gas industry ran an opposition campaign like I haven’t seen since...forever.
9891 2018-11-07 04:21:56 Beto made it damn close. Cornyn comes up for re-election in 2020. If the price of oil crashes (which signs are pointing that way), and the overall economy goes down, things could break the other way. That is, if Beto doesn’t run for President.

9895 2018-11-07 04:21:40 Bruh those oil pens are LIT. I come home high as shit, and don’t smell like pounds of loud 
9896 2018-11-07 04:21:34 Have you ever even been to Ft Mac? Have you ever worked in the oil sands or seen what they do up there first hand? If the answer to any of those questions is no STFU and go look for yourself it’s not the wasteland liberals and the CBC make it out to be...
9897 2018-11-07 04:21:28 Wife was disowned by her brother (again) for voting Cruz.  Oh, he also disowned her in 2016 for voting trump.  Does a double disown mean shes his sister again? Not sure how that works.

9902 2018-11-07 04:20:59 Wrong. They are most of the state. They are the reason we have an economy and food and oil and etc. 

I’m not saying you specifically think they’re inferior, but I’ve seen plenty of it tonight on twitter.

9909 2018-11-07 04:20:38 A few things you can do: try meditation/yoga, CBD oil (for temp fix), or do a social media cleanse for a couple weeks possibly? Might take your mind off stuff :)

9911 2018-11-07 04:20:21 If @tedcruz couldn’t take corporate /PAC money from oil companies and the NRA he would quit the job in a heart beat. You really are delusional if you voted for that troll over @BetoORourke
9912 2018-11-07 04:20:18 Anyone who wants to put a tax on crude oil in this state at $10 a barrel doesn't have the best interest of its citizens in mind.

9914 2018-11-07 04:20:14 Because when you change your own oil, you know for a fact it’s done. These quick lube places don’t always do all the work. SOF is very common practice. Same oil filter.

Heading to the great state of Texas! Under republican leadership and mostly thanks to #realDonaldTrump, They are the worlds third largest producer of oil: 1. USA 2. Russia 3. Texas 4. Obama’s favorite country, Iran God bless Texas!
9938 2018-11-07 04:17:57 But let’s use it wisely and transparently. Nothing makes sense in Zimbabwe. Diamonds were discovered they never helped the right people. Now oil that’s if it’s there people generally don’t believe in the positive it could bring.

9941 2018-11-07 04:17:19 At least Abbott was man enough to tell trump that the tariffs would fuck up the oil and gas market in Texas. So I feel a little bit better that Abbott not gonna be wishy-washy and switch up on a wim

9948 2018-11-07 04:16:31 We don’t need ur oil. We would be perfectly fine if Texas just blew up. The oils is not necessarily for our daily lives, if we REALLY need it we can get it elsewhere, and u ain’t pulling in enough money that anyone will notice if Texas just went poof

9951 2018-11-07 04:16:13 Texas is Texas. We have more churches than libraries, more gun ranges than museums, and more Republicans than Democrats. That will not change until the economic model does. Geology has made this state wealthy in spite of our bad actions. A shift away from oil will impoverish us.

9953 2018-11-07 04:16:07 at least we voted against oil drilling
9954 2018-11-07 04:16:06 I know half of y’all selfishly voted for Cruz because you work in the oil field and there are deeper issues than that that you chose to ignore because they don’t affect you in a positive way.
9955 2018-11-07 04:16:05 What's he talking about? He has plenty of money-start w/that from the oil industry. My God people believe his BS?

9973 2018-11-07 04:14:16 This is like 1978. The rising tide makes gains but few breakthroughs. 

The breakthrough for oil came in 1980. It will come for tech in 2020, because #GOP policies on tech are going to piss tech off bigly.

9977 2018-11-07 04:14:03 Damn right! Years back a bunch of friends and I were doing an overnight movie marathon and we got pizza. One of them put fries on the stove, then once the oil was drained he salted them and plopped them still hissing onto the pizza. DEE-LICIOUS!

9980 2018-11-07 04:13:43 Looking forward to sending families away from a place they've lived all their lives. Taking women's right to say what she wants about her body. Also continuing drilling oil from our ground which causes earth quakes and landslides. And republicans is care about themselves.
9981 2018-11-07 04:13:39 If they were really smart they'd start attacking offshore oil rigs, since that's a big part of how *they're* going to die.

9998 2018-11-07 04:12:34 Exactly! But I feel like no matter who comes to their power somethings will remain the same like going after middle eastern countries for oil ( and can*abis of course ) but some things gets a bit better

10001 2018-11-07 04:12:30 You must not live in Texas. It's not about Ted. It's about the GOP stronghold on Texas. Oil & Gas will do whatever to keep their bidders in office.
