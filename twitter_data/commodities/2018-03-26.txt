5 2018-03-26 23:22:54 We really don’t understand anything about price inflation. That’s why #FOMC is flummoxed. I’ve been studying historical commodities charts. If we focus on past 50 yrs, instead of the past 5-10 yrs, we can see a stunning lack of inflation in nearly every consumable.

Now with Duterte dollar rate to peso soared high, P53 to $1, a clear proof Phl economy going down the drain. Basic commodities are so high-priced, more hardship for the poor

44 2018-03-26 20:41:16 #rpglifeuk At lower values, that chart assumes an exchange of goods rather than outright sale, while at higher values, the traders sold the goods, bought other goods & still had cash excess. If party is stuck with commodities, perhaps adventure to establish a market for them?

51 2018-03-26 20:19:18 Not only that but every coin to "invest" in means inflation. To those replying here: Inflation is just an abundance of supply wrt demand. People only have so much money to spend on coins, silver, gold, or other commodities.
52 2018-03-26 20:10:31 Most Commodities production comes from china, other wise, europe answer as anglosaxon partner by supporting UK sanctions
53 2018-03-26 19:57:45 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
54 2018-03-26 19:53:17 According to financial analysts the future of the dollar is not that bright. In the meantime most commodities are quoted in dollars. Whilst the Central Bankers control the price of gold the dollar is safe.

60 2018-03-26 18:49:06 in the same way we are talking abt a asset which we can`t consume.
we are talking abt an asset which we are going to hold and which is limited just as land.

do u know that limited commodities have an upward trend of demand ??
jus sayin on  a friendly note, nothing morethan that.

102 2018-03-26 15:42:55 In the US, cryptocurrencies are considered as commodities, at least by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In Japan, the government acknowledged cryptocurrencies as a legal currency, allowing citizens and businesses to utilize cryptocurrencies.

112 2018-03-26 14:53:23 The difference is the impact in expelling EU and US diplomats, which will be very limited. Nowadays, Russia's exports consist of commodities a lot of other countries have. There won't be a WW3. Putin's not stupid. He doesn't want to be annihilated. All he has are sneaky attacks.

118 2018-03-26 14:39:54 I mean Oil, Gas, Mining stocks were actually HIGHER when the commodities that support them were at HALF their current value???
119 2018-03-26 14:39:23 China has set the stage for a 21st century, where in the medium term future, people will begin to refer to the value of international commodities based on their relative worth in Yuan rather than US dollars. ~ Adam Garrie

FWIW we are long commodities in general and oil specifically through a couple of derivatives.

161 2018-03-26 11:25:20 Certainly not - it also explains why #Russia has shown an uncharacteristically strong commitment to the #OPEC production cut deal so far. Russia will do better with #oil prices at US$60-70/b, even if that means handing market share to the US. @maxlambertson

182 2018-03-26 08:44:00 At the same time, demand for commodities plummeted on the back of a global slowdown driving commodity prices down. Africa's debt was suddenly twice as expensive as planned and income halved. Some countries have never recovered.

231 2018-03-26 02:54:42 A little about me...

I’m 17 years old. 
I’m a futures/commodities trader
I’m currently a junior in high school. 
I took a different path and plan to follow it 

Would love to get to know some of you more!
232 2018-03-26 02:47:03 You speak with clarity and insight which I highly value. Two very rare commodities on Twitter. Thank you for all your hard work.
233 2018-03-26 02:43:27 Small accounts should stay out , during volatile trade .. Lotto Trades are far between... . I  Remember commodities futures days ....  85-90% small traders accounts lost their money
234 2018-03-26 02:42:03 Might or might not happen but China wants that option open, that is why it is building stockpiles of gold and industrial commodities. The longer they delay this, better it is for them.
235 2018-03-26 02:40:36 @CarpeNoctom do you use different cloud settings for commodities?
236 2018-03-26 02:38:49 In fairness to Australia, commodities markets are global. Even if Australia ships commodities to China (or any other state), it is doing so priced on the basis of global markets pricing. It is a price taker in that transaction. When it comes to gold, Australia adds some serious +

238 2018-03-26 02:29:25 I can't remember, do commodities and materials fall under "land"?

Still Rebar -3% 
Coke -2.27% 
Copper -2% 
Nickel -2.20% 
Rubber -5.91%

240 2018-03-26 02:17:38 His little show a couple of weeks ago where he came down on NRA likely helped spike sales for a bit.   But frankly all commodities have a saturation point
241 2018-03-26 02:13:27 Sure, that's in the dictionary definition of fetish (viz, also, commodities) but why the dick jokes?

244 2018-03-26 01:59:25 if you would like here's the one of the definitions for you to producing or able to produce large amounts of goods, crops, or other commodities.
245 2018-03-26 01:54:20 That was the cliff copper was always going to fall over. After a stellar run. Deflation in commodities along with equities is the short term trend. Red is the new Green!!!
246 2018-03-26 01:43:25 Innovar sería implementar la metodología #LifeCycleAssessment a commodities del agro para analizar empíricamente, por ej. nivel de sustentabilidad medioambiental del producto. Podría ser utilizado como estrategia de marketing tb. El software #SimaPro hace la pega.
247 2018-03-26 01:42:50 Why CAN'T hlthcare workers (4+ M of us) have a march? NOT for patients BUT for US! It is US who others walk ALL OVER, treat as commodities, assault, work w/ unsafe nurse:patient ratios, witness fraud/waste/abuse & the collateral damage, & lose our jobs! It is US! #MarchForOurJobs
248 2018-03-26 01:42:26 2018:Gearing up for commodities. 20-30yr track records, reviewed old gang from 2005-2010 with summary notes: Don't live next to a corn field when trading futures. Judgement skew.
249 2018-03-26 01:37:27 Sell signal in broad based commodities.
250 2018-03-26 01:30:21 These are the people who are into pageants for even young girls. Girls and women are commodities to market and own. The partners they choose reveal both misogyny and insecurity. Contrast with Obama and Biden who married smart strong women.
251 2018-03-26 01:22:11 I'm recommending to add on to your Soybean oil positions as it ready to give a daily buy at 32.43 and a Weekly Buy signal at 32.81a pound. Dry conditions moving back in. Add on to wheat if we get a setback. Stay long corn and soybeans. #soybeans #Commodities #ETF #Farming
252 2018-03-26 01:16:51 Commodities are weak but the Crude oil is still going very strong. How long the trend will continue? It is not cooling off.
253 2018-03-26 01:04:47 SGX down 75

Crude on friday up 2.5%, up 0.6% today

Global cues weak

LME weak and sell off in China commodities.....Rubber down 6%, Steel down 3%
254 2018-03-26 00:44:01 Pretty soon rural America is going to have real problems to worry about after China starts hitting us back on tariffs when they stop buying our agriculture and the price of commodities drop like a stone. Then they will be looking for handouts from a govt. They helped to destroy.
255 2018-03-26 00:41:40 Em termos administrativos, teve a sorte do boom das commodities mas não aproveitou pois mandou o povo consumir sem o país ter capacidade produtiva suficiente. Lula delegava tudo e nunca sabia de nada!! Ou era péssimo administrador, ou mentiroso, ou incompetente. Ou os 3.
256 2018-03-26 00:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
257 2018-03-26 00:35:24 Financial assets are usually more liquid than other tangible assets such as commodities or real estate #UniChallengeRw
258 2018-03-26 00:03:46 #investing in cyclical and commodities is an art, right entry and right exist is very important.
Right entry but wrong exit/Wrong entry but right exit=small loss.
Wrong entry and wrong exit=disastrous. Understand the business do not blindly follow trend in cyclical/comm.
259 2018-03-26 00:00:00 As usual, anything worthy of attention please feel free to share any trade ideas you have going into the new week...
