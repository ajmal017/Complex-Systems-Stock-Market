I'm not surprised that students sought "relevant knowledge" when we've turned knowledge and information into commodities, made it almost impossible to escape a prescribed education track, and reinforced an unjust economic order.

3 2018-07-14 23:40:59 Some misguided socialists label any well compensated workers as petit bourgeois. This is incorrect. The term refers to small business owners, and is sometimes extended to the upper echelon of the working class who do not produce commodities but manage production for capitalists.

12 2018-07-14 22:57:16 That's great news. Now we need some price control. Stop these oil companies from gouging us. Maybe taking it off the commodities market? Since we have so much here, we shouldn't be paying near $3.00 a gallon.

43 2018-07-14 21:50:07 Well it may be, so long as they do not also hold any actionable investments in those same tradable commodities, because that could be considered insider trading.

46 2018-07-14 21:04:32 The debate is not about commodities,  but rather about comparing the length of time the Queen has been Queen with the length of time Biya has been president. It is so difficult to understand? The Queen is Queen for life, the president is not meant to be president for life.
47 2018-07-14 20:44:56 That's why cryptoassets can reasonably be classified as commodities: there's no promise of future efforts or flows

And as has happened with many commodities, some are adopted as money

51 2018-07-14 19:36:21 Yes, that's true!

What I should've mentioned is that's how luxuries turn into commodities.

E.g. smartphones are no longer a luxury and pretty affordable.

My point is that chasing profits (capitalism) turns luxuries into commodities anyway. Profit doesn't exclude distribution.
52 2018-07-14 19:30:09 This happens every week in commodities when a major report is released. Literally every week.

56 2018-07-14 18:46:34 The craziest thing in a high-inflation economy, commodities become valuable because they increase in value with inflation better than most things. This means that the gold advertisers on Fox News make more money. 

And then there's oil...

59 2018-07-14 18:10:19 Because highly sentient, neurologically complex mammals and birds aren't the kinds of inanimate commodities that belong on a production line. They're conscious individuals with minds and personalities. It's degrading to treat them as mere tools and units of production.

64 2018-07-14 17:44:46 Lots of farms don't produce undifferentiated commodities. And lots of farms that are working farms, not family gardens don't take advantage of scale.
65 2018-07-14 17:42:00 If you don’t want China dominate trade, then make yourself better instead of hurting the others. Since you think it’s not fair that Chinese commodities are too cheap, why start anew at those simple works which American market abandoned first.
66 2018-07-14 17:00:17 What do you want them to do? Keep trading guys that are proving it for unproven commodities? That’s a never ending rebuild
67 2018-07-14 16:55:58 Well see the US is a brutal dictatorship where people are murdered in prisons so clearly the correct answer is to carpet bomb US cities and starve civilians of vital commodities like fuel and food. Why do you hate human rights?
68 2018-07-14 16:50:52 As far as commodities are concerned it isn’t the most environmentally friendly but they’ve got a lot of it (around $3bn). Having said that #EUZ has $3.65bn of zinc, lead, silver. A lot more acceptable and in a mining friendly jurisdiction and this counts for a lot.
69 2018-07-14 16:33:09 El éxito de Singapur se debe a un sistema educativo excelente y uno de los índices de corrupción más bajos del mundo. El único recurso que tienen es el humano y por eso le apostaron a la educación... no dependen de los precios de lo “commodities” como Colombia.
70 2018-07-14 16:32:44 The immense volume of clay tablets unearthed in the ruins of the Sumerian temples where the accounts were kept suggests a social differentiation within the scribal class, with a virtual army of lower-ranking tabulators performing the monotonous job of tallying commodities.

76 2018-07-14 15:51:01 As a farmer, I can tell you any chance of making a profit this year off of commodities is gone. Soybeans down 20%, corn 16%... that's more than my profit margin in an average year. But wait... there's more! Parts & machinery costs are skyrocketing. So is fuel #FarmersAgainstTrump
77 2018-07-14 15:46:12 I support the decision to allow food inside the theatre till the people can keep them clean and tidy.

90 2018-07-14 14:41:22 Oye, pero que unidimensional para los análisis. Cuánto influyó la crisis de los Commodities en la baja en el riesgo país? Otros mercados se convirtieron en más atractivos. La región entró en crisis a partir del 2014. Los trabajos informales parten el 2010 con la nueva medición
91 2018-07-14 14:34:32 Please hurry and fix the trade deals.  The uncertainty is killing the prices of our ag commodities.  American farmers and ranchers were already hurting
92 2018-07-14 14:21:45 I trade gold stocks not gold. Commodities and commodity stocks trade on differently.  However, IMO gold has started a new emerging uptrend although current price action would lead us to wonder.  For now I operate under that premise.  Gold stocks look better than gold 4 now

107 2018-07-14 13:05:01 I guess you're referring to "Technology" as an export commodity, which can grow in time, but #startupaus or #startups in general can also cater to any of these high-yield commodities. It can be tech-assisted, not necessarily all-tech.
108 2018-07-14 12:59:38 Grow up what about foreign debts ??? What about exports what about dollar ??? What about corruption in these mega construction projects ??? The devaluation in rupee automatically increase inflation as all your local commodities are imports. Don’t think like a Patwari
109 2018-07-14 12:59:31 all of the things she cited are commodities, not rights.

111 2018-07-14 12:50:56 In my opinion, the revolution was fomented by Western governments to take down and exploit the Russian people/resources for almost a century.   Leftist movements are rarely organic.  They are cruel and misleading as people ultimately become commodities.  Brits were in on it.
112 2018-07-14 12:40:09 Time for a commodities boom?
113 2018-07-14 12:39:25 Fishing & farming, we are extremely resource rich, but we are not seeing any value being added locally. We should encourage local food prod. adding & retaining value all along the chain, instead of producing raw materials for export as commodities in bulk tankers
114 2018-07-14 12:33:35 This is super interesting. I take for granted how much info is available to some commodities that just doesn't exist for others that are still considered "young". There's been NZ lamb on sale at Food Basics for 2 wks. I can't understand why when I know so many sheep farmers.

This madness must end NOW!

120 2018-07-14 11:59:48 Back in the day, markets would look at #commodities crashing and worry. Then again, back in the day central banks didn't hold $15 trillion-ish in assets.

130 2018-07-14 10:06:18 Sadly, most fans couldn't care less about this. They see players as commodities there for their entertainment, not as other humans. They don't care about their health and safety, same as the league, they only care about seeing a good show, damn the consequences. It's disgusting.

140 2018-07-14 06:29:44 is it hypocritical for an anti-capitalist to purchase anything in a capitalist system? 

Nope because it's LABOR that produced my cellphone, my coffee, and the shoes i bought. Capitalism merely dictates who gets to take home the surplus value/profit from those commodities.

146 2018-07-14 05:26:53 No , this is about moral depravity . The Waltons like so many Corp execs and majority shareholders the world over regard  people as nothing more than commodities to be converted into profit - a line on the income statement. A new age of mass resistance is long overdue !!!

153 2018-07-14 03:15:27 and pay an additional $2700 for fuel and other commodities while deficits balloon out of control causing higher interest rates eating away even more purchasing power, causing more inflation and the inevitable higher taxes to make up for you bankrupting the treasury

155 2018-07-14 03:12:32 As a professional buyer (formally of commodities) I am all too aware of how 1) It’s a challenge to pass on costs from a commercial perspective and 2) Often times they are not passed on and are absorbed indeterminately. I appreciate your perspective

157 2018-07-14 02:58:58 Even if it doesn’t matter it will send a message to common people that governments aim is to ease up their living and make commodities cheap and available under the budget of common citizens..but then can’t even think what modi and shah have up their sleeves
158 2018-07-14 02:56:05 All commodities are based on demand and supply. The use case of Bitcoin is for peer-peer exchange. The Use case of XRP is freeing up Nostro/Vostro accounts that hold 10trillion in idle capital. Bitcoin is just the tool, if they are faster cheaper tool wins the end game :)
159 2018-07-14 02:47:59 Good thing little to none of those commodities are grown in CA10. Oh, and you’re quoting Canadian grain markets. Do they not teach geography in the Bay Area?
160 2018-07-14 02:45:33 Time to skip the middle man.  Straight from Canada to China with soybean and all commodities. No tariffs here. Better quality product aswell.
161 2018-07-14 02:36:32 At its core capitalism is private ownership of the means of production, where commodities are produced in order to be sold on the market.  None of this existed in the USSR or Cuba, yet somehow these countries are ‘capitalist’

A decentralized commodities trading platform, significantly transforms and enhances international physical commodity trading across its whole product life cycle. The use of this platform would result in more timely deliveries and lower cost.
163 2018-07-14 02:13:49 “The expression of self through one’s relationship to and creative use of commodities is a central practice in capitalist society” (Bettie, 2000) I think I just read the scholarly way to argue what @Madonna sang about in 1984.
164 2018-07-14 01:56:23 Me admira muito você achar que uma pessoa pode ser tão importante na economia de um país,ignorando totalmente a conjuntura econômica global.Lula teve seus méritos,mas o sucesso de seu governo deveu-se,em grande parte, ao boom das Commodities e a China.Ouviu falar?pelo jeito, não.
165 2018-07-14 01:53:02 Ppl think other airlines are better cause they offer those things “free”. NOT the case you actually pay for all those little commodities in those taxes and fees! Whether you use them or not. With spirit you pay only for that flight and whatever else you choose to use
166 2018-07-14 01:50:51 Prices of essential commodities r soaring high into the sky , prices of petrol , diseal and gas is at all time high , inflation is at five percent , no direct foreign investments coming in manufacturing , retail , railways and infra , f d i is restricted mostly in share market
167 2018-07-14 01:21:06 The most horrible part about geo is they treat our loved ones better than the state facility.  All prisons treat the people that reside within their walls as commodities. Its heartbreaking.

170 2018-07-14 00:38:37 Socialism doesn’t go far enough and still allows for capitalism. I think Ai should nominate work to anyone who wants to work in a particular company and allow workers voting on everything the company does. Also trade would be done through commodities and not money.
171 2018-07-14 00:20:53 Food, water, shelter and medical care are not rights.  They are commodities and services.  Making someone deliver these by force is called slavery.  How come you’re not escaping America for Cuba, Venezuela or any other broke socialist country?  Live it before you preach it.
172 2018-07-14 00:11:08 Donnie we buy oil and other commodities from Russia, so I would be careful of pointing that finger at countries whose leaders have a much higher IQ and understanding of the way the world works. And the 2% is money that stays in each country. Learn how NATO works idiot.

210 2018-07-15 21:17:55 Usually, #commodities are strong during the last leg of an economic #cycle. The picture doesn’t apply now, nor in 2000. Fine in 2008. Comments?
211 2018-07-15 21:17:02 I have seen the price of gas. Yes it’s up but it’s always up in summer. Bread same price at my shop rite. Gas and oil are commodities driven by supply and demand. Get the environmentalists out of the to drill for more oil and watch the price plummet .
212 2018-07-15 21:15:02 Not sure if you know this but even animals have to work to get their food and water. You simply can’t get something without putting energy and effort into it. Also food, water, etc. aren’t rights, they are commodities. Everyone has a right to equal OPPORTUNITY to those items
213 2018-07-15 21:00:57 Buhari is the worst thing to happen to Nigeria.

223 2018-07-15 19:28:28 I like the chart but it doesn't say whether commodities are cheap or equities are expensive, only their relative valuation to each other. If commodities are a buy this chart may also suggest that equities are a poor way of getting exposure.

228 2018-07-15 18:48:10 QE already caused asset inflation everywhere. Stocks, bonds, property, even bitcoin 

Wait till commodities start rallying. The money will flow around eventually. That’s the breaking point for the consumer inflation on everyday goods.
229 2018-07-15 18:42:58 People shouldn't be commodities. But, I bet to big time capitalist people ARE commodities.
230 2018-07-15 18:33:17 We pay for water because people WORK  to filter it for you.

We pay for healthcare because people WORK. To research medicine for you 

We pay for Food because people WORK  to raise and cultivate it for you. 

These things aren’t rights they are commodities.

244 2018-07-15 17:15:06 Temples came up in India before 15th century when India was biggest exporter, even ahead of China, of finest artifacts apart from commodities.

245 2018-07-15 17:02:28 Apparently you don't understand the concept of world commodities. Where exactly should Germany run a pipeline from? They aren't giving them billions of dollars to strengthen them. They are purchasing a product that they require from the only country close enough.
246 2018-07-15 16:48:56 Terrible idea indeed, also because it wrongly assumes that data can and should be owned as if they were private commodities - while in fact each re-use warrants a re-examination of whose rights and needs are been served (or not)
247 2018-07-15 16:47:27 Standards? It's not about that sir, it's about trade policies adopted by the EU that affect high-end US agricultural products (none commodities) and put us in disadvantage and you know it
248 2018-07-15 16:45:06 Sentient creatures viewed as mere commodities. Disgusting.

250 2018-07-15 16:40:43 Cross cultural trade/ market is important and more encouraged regarding inadequate commodities. You make a good point by the way. But BF is a haven now cos tomatoes from that part last longer longer than the local ones and relatively cheaper too...
251 2018-07-15 16:38:17 it’s more complicated than that. there’s a ton of competition and it generally comes down to a price war because books are commodities now, like music. it can be the case that shipping cost is higher than the profit on physical goods.
252 2018-07-15 16:19:48 Now, after the fact: since the sell off was almost in all commodities, not only oil, we could be over reading into it.
253 2018-07-15 16:05:03 3253: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
254 2018-07-15 16:04:42 ¿"...cómo mejoraba la vida de..."? ¿De qué hablás? ¡El kirnerismo fue un 97% relato y un 3% de obras gracias los precios irreptibles de los commodities agrarios! El resto fue todo relato: ¡me cansé de ver las mentiras de las "inauguraciones" de fábricas, establecimientos,, etc.!
255 2018-07-15 15:52:57 All were doing is giving everyone more reasons to abandon the dollar as world reserve currency, to stop pricing commodities in dollars, etc. Theres a lot of people who are not looking at second and third order effects.
256 2018-07-15 15:51:12 Cuánta tierra vírgen productiva hay? Vuelvo a decir, hay limitantes, de suelo, de clima, de acceso a mercado. Aún cuando la soja valía mucho y habían reducido el mercado d otros commodities, no se hacía sólo soja.
257 2018-07-15 15:48:59 Who is NNPC paying subsidies to?. What is the Landing cost of fuel and how is it at the pump per litre? What is the responsibility of the government regarding subsidizing commodities for its citizens. Answer those questions for me abeg
258 2018-07-15 15:33:22 This is why I don’t talk to my family. Carson was their pick for the Rep candidate. My grandmother was on some form of “socialized” assistance my entire life (SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, commodities) yet in my families mind, it the “other” people not pulling their weight.

260 2018-07-15 15:16:32 @j_jolissaint  I would love to see the AAPL start fighting for physician autonomy and end corp med from abusing employed physicians, ALL physicians need to be considered “leaders” and not viewed as dispensable commodities.
261 2018-07-15 15:12:15 Part of Britain’s hope for America, beyond discovering precious metals and commodities, was to create a place for the so called dangerous classes. No one reading this will express surprise.
262 2018-07-15 15:10:27 That rarest of commodities, a fact. Thank you @TheAccountantUK . It would seem that only high earning immigrants pay in more than they take out. The vast majority of EU workers do not (presumably) fall into that category. Neither do I for that matter (sadly).
263 2018-07-15 15:02:56 Been looking at commodities, the seem to have an active summer, plus their cheap to trade I.e gold!
264 2018-07-15 15:01:18 You're saying that Canada needs high commodity prices but that the "globalism" of Trudeau is harming us? Okay, our commodities boom was based on trading our resources and products with the growing developing world (china, india). "Globalism" is why we're rich in the first place.
265 2018-07-15 15:00:08 Horror ! It just shows how shamefully ignorant and irresponsible we are.
Hope the Government announces immediate guidelines for the companies that are selling food/ commodities in plastic packets/bottles participate in clean up drives. Or finance the same.
266 2018-07-15 14:58:03 Cero mérito de Néstor post 2001.  Tremenda devaluación de Lavagna. Prat Gay limpio todas las "cuasimonedas". Contexto internacional con alta demanda de commodities y precios récord. Se nos alinearon los planetas, pero los gobiernos de turno desaprovecharon la oportunidad.

269 2018-07-15 14:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
270 2018-07-15 14:33:27 Your "rights" to access these are purely based on you paying or receiving the access to the commodities. If you choose not to pay then no right to use them.
If you choose not to work and have no money then nobody has any obligation to assist you.
271 2018-07-15 14:30:33 Not working is immoral as you are causing people to become slaves to your laziness.
You have rights to food, water, shelter and health but not the commodities. You can grow your own food, collect your own water, create your shelter but use what others create such as medicines
272 2018-07-15 14:22:31 You confuse commodities with rights.  The only “right” you have in this instance is to get/provide it yourself.  You speak of the need for these materials, yet give no consideration to where said materials come from.  This way of thinking consistently fails in practice
273 2018-07-15 14:22:12 No. They are different. The labor theory of value is Adam Smith and focuses specifically on how value is determined. The law of value you're referring to is Marx's system regarding the trade and production of commodities.
274 2018-07-15 14:17:57 He inherited a commodities crash actually where oil was as low as $30 per barrel.
275 2018-07-15 14:02:03 I see you like commodities and mining stocks - how do you rate the guys at HUM ? They would be rated First Class by me
276 2018-07-15 13:59:05 Stupid. Before he ran for president, the guy looked for investors. Duh. Russians had a lot around the commodities bubble in 2009-2011 and looked to diversify. Has saudi investors too. They always have cash to burn. Clintons did business russia.   America has investments in china.
277 2018-07-15 13:58:15 For commodities I’d argue China monpol matters more than Fed
278 2018-07-15 13:55:43 Correlation very positive these days between financial assets and commodities because, well, a lot of people now treat commodities as financial assets.  The paradigm probably shifted 10 to 15 years ago.
279 2018-07-15 13:55:10 Nenhum país do mundo se desenvolveu encima da produção e exportação de commodities. Coréia e Taiwan se desenvolveram com base em uma indústria de bens de capital forte e com enorme apoio estatal. O Japão é um nada na produção agrícola, depende de importar quase tudo que consome.
280 2018-07-15 13:54:59 The #WorldCup football expert analysis on #SonyTen is an #EpicFail. No infographics, figures or tech play. There is a huge gap to bridge between #Ind and ROW in terms of broadcast sports analysis. The so-called foreign 'experts' are rather unknown commodities.
281 2018-07-15 13:51:27 De Getulio a Dilma com rara exceção apostamos nos campeões nacionais, numa politica protecionista da industria, em alto endividamento do estado para favorecer setores privilegiados e ainda calcamos nosso comercio exterior em commodities. Fala-se de um mundo protecionista agora.
282 2018-07-15 13:50:48 KRATOS is an Ethereum-based platform that employs Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts to provide a decentralized commodities trading platform. This solution will significantly transform international physical commodity trading. #KRATOSICO #Arkratos
283 2018-07-15 13:50:29 You can't have a right that requires a positive action like providing good and services. Rights are the limits the actions a Government can take. Goods and Services are commodities and property that belong to someone. Barter and trade is how you feed & house yourself.
284 2018-07-15 13:47:03 Guess you can't name the Canadian source, can you?
Anyway, I really like what you guys are doing.

"Strategic Metallurgy has a proven history of delivering quality metallurgical  outcomes using various metallurgical tools and processes across a range of commodities."

100% agree.
285 2018-07-15 13:44:33 The government does not want public disclosure of Tesla's work en masse because it would rapidly outstrip fossil fuels and other societal control commodities.
286 2018-07-15 13:43:33 Creates megacompanies who view workers as commodities. Hurts the proprietors who want to see workers succeed, maybe even take over the business.
287 2018-07-15 13:42:39 @aedison You can't have a right that requires a positive action like providing good and services. Rights are the limits on the actions a Government can take. Goods and Services are commodities and property that belong to someone. Barter & trade is how you feed & house yourself.
288 2018-07-15 13:36:20 If true, the market will price in “easy monetary policy” months in advance. USD at high, commodities at low right now ...
289 2018-07-15 13:33:53 For the week, losses dominated the commodities again as another round of tariffs were announced.  White House implementing another $200 billion of tariffs after 2 month comment period, which puts it around late Aug/early Sept.  Brings total against China to $250 billion
290 2018-07-15 13:31:16 i hate the conversation about protesters “destroying property” .. you’re respecting material objects and commodities more so than a FUCKING HUMAN BEING’S LIFE
291 2018-07-15 13:30:56 #Commodities Part of seeing is learning how to "listen" to what the market is trying to tell us. Take "palladium" for an example: To the average trader...they see and or look at their charts...but they lack the ability to listen to the data... to see one must learn how to listen.
292 2018-07-15 13:25:53 Big business want more profit, and the best way to do that is reduce workers rights, safety regs etc. Almost all political leanings support big businesses quest for complete ownership of all commodities. Leaving the EU with a right wing party will turn us into a 'banana republic'
293 2018-07-15 13:04:23 I don't support high taxation on basic commodities, I'm a type of socialist who supports worker control of production via a transition to worker co-operatives as well as the provision of basic needs such as medical treatment, water, housing, etc as much as possible by... 1/
294 2018-07-15 12:58:15 So as a socialist I suppose you do care about high taxation on basic commodities in lets say Mozambique?
295 2018-07-15 12:54:12 The causal factors in health are many, and the provision of medical care is only one. Particularly at low levels of income, other commodities such as nutrition, shelter, clothing, and sanitation may be much more significant
296 2018-07-15 12:48:26 Trading doctrine that says u can't win a significant percent of trades is simply a lie. They haven't investigated, learned, are afraid, don't care to learn the world has changed. In commodities over 90% is reality. Equity swing + 80% win rate is reality. Junk momos variable.
297 2018-07-15 12:45:44 @Bamabroker Euro up, Gold up, Yuan Up, Oil Down, Risk Down, DXY Down

Don’t see how Oil & Risk decline in a Euro ramp while Gold and Silver and likely other commodities ramp
298 2018-07-15 12:17:34 Uno y fundamental para nuestra decadencia: "Argentina es un país lleno de riquezas" En el siglo XXI, producir fácilmente proteínas u otros commodities te acerca mas a África que al desarrollo. La tecnología de la info y los datos son la verdadera riqueza.
299 2018-07-15 12:16:06 They absolutely love money.... none give a flying fig about their ‘commodities’ even the more kind hearted ones of which I’ve known a couple
300 2018-07-15 12:06:32 Crecimos por sobre la media de americ latina y Perú no depende tanto de los commodities como nosotros. Lo cómico es que estábamos en “crisis” pero hubo récord de venta de viviendas, autos, bolsa, retail, bancos! Lo demás es delirio momio por fanatismo ideológico
301 2018-07-15 12:01:54 They don't represent a nation - they represent money. Bought and sold, traded like commodities. No such thing as a national team in the west these days. Football is a corrupt sport
302 2018-07-15 11:58:14 Crisis de commodities hizo q la region entera entrara en recesión. Entonces, otros mercados se volvieron más atractivos. En cuando a desempleo, bajo Bachelet (6,44%) índice fue más bajo q con Piñera, quien contó con el precio del cobre alto y el dinamismo de la reconstrucción
303 2018-07-15 11:48:12 A market is not a truth mechanism, but rather an interaction of human beings whereby their expectations, beliefs, hopes, and fears shape overall market prices.

304 2018-07-15 11:35:30 Problem is we discuss care services like commodities. In which case it is booming .Demand is out stripping supply which in a business world is ideal.
305 2018-07-15 11:19:51 Ya, pero bueno ese discurso de reproduce mucho. El de las commodities culturales y tal.
306 2018-07-15 11:08:07 Relative to commodity trading, I have found that it is always best to trade what you see (what's in front you) rather than trying to anticipate what might happen in market....what are your feelings about that? #commodities
307 2018-07-15 11:04:52 Yes, right before they become commodities.
308 2018-07-15 10:55:16 Lmao the guys' war on drugs kills innocent people but lets rich drug lords get away and his tax reforms are raising prices even higher making basic commodities even harder to buy +and he literally told them that he doesnt care if they starve but sure Duterte cares about the poor
309 2018-07-15 10:19:03 is the gold standard history or is it beyond a man-made story (in terms of a new sociology a narration)? As total equivalent gold appears (!) to be a store above or under all commodities
310 2018-07-15 10:15:25 It's exactly like the NYSE futures market! You are paying a lower price for today commodities for forecasted increased margins in tomorrow's market.
311 2018-07-15 10:14:45 4. Biafran Civil War,Somali Civil War, Liberian Civil War,American military in West Africa,civil war in Côte D'Ivoire=energy companies/commodities firms supplied arms & it can be proven that they directly benefitted from these conflicts. #SouthSudan
312 2018-07-15 10:13:18 Manufacturing and Agriculture should be focused first on those commodities that Nigerians consume that constitute the largest imports. Then we can progress to looking at what niche we can carve for exportation. We could do this simultaneously.
313 2018-07-15 10:13:09 It's a milestone @UNRA_UG has achieved to ease Transportation of Humans and Commodities across the shores. But isn't cost sharing through paying a little transport fare good to reduce the costs more sustainable for the Government and the Taxpayers?
314 2018-07-15 10:05:17 But the sad reality is that the toxic combo of CPI gerrymandering and shifting conditions around AI and ML IP, if sustained, could slow the pace of Twitter-based commodities trading and the development of methan-based biomass energy alternatives. ~ Philosophy grad ex-musician.
315 2018-07-15 09:25:37 Worth asking the question! 
Interfering in the market hard for kiwis to accept. Not being able to afford “our own” produce... also up there! Applies to commodities as well ie butter
316 2018-07-15 09:11:09 Excess developments so living cost is too high hence poor and common peoples of country are unable to sustain their life in urban....@##prices hike of commodities,petrol,diesel,lpg,charges of services....#@@acheche din of modiji is too costly.
317 2018-07-15 09:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
318 2018-07-15 09:05:07 “Correlations within commodities and currency pairs can be worth being aware of. For instance a significantly large oil exporting country’s currency paired with a large importing region. Upshot you don’t always have the play the underlying but rather a substitute.” #forex @LVDTA
319 2018-07-15 09:02:45 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
320 2018-07-15 08:56:02 Dude. From what I've seen you're a strong trader (literally lol). You can't imagine the boost it would give long term. Learn the basics of forex fundamental analysis, (short cut obviously you know techs) then jump to commodities in general. 
Step 3: you're done go own the market.
321 2018-07-15 08:10:06 Agree with all that except the "This is sport". It isn't it's depraved barbarity that treats animals as commodities and debases the humans who take part and those who facilitate it.
322 2018-07-15 08:09:41 The blame lies squarely on the Uhuru Kenyatta administration. Clearly this Government which I voted for is not for the common man. Ni story tu! You saw the attitude with the Govt spokesman Mr. Kiraithe MY INLAW. Now fuel has gone up n so have the prices of the basic commodities.
323 2018-07-15 07:59:52 IPA sees people as consumers, commodities, commoners. Never as citizens.

331 2018-07-15 06:26:18 If it is decided to import them, the rate of growth of the economy would be constrained by the rate of growth of world demand for India's exportable commodities.
332 2018-07-15 06:09:22 We are the market...not the commodities
333 2018-07-15 06:01:26 1/2 Selling commodities is not a foundation for a secure economy. Even if the price is high (for a while), what happens when the resource is depleted?
The cost of an iPhone (for example) is a massive premium on the resources used in its manufacture.
334 2018-07-15 05:49:48 The IPA see people as commodities. We are not an economy, we are a society.
335 2018-07-15 05:47:06 It's my belief that the mistake that most traders make in trading is that we focus too much on the speculative aspect of what we do relative to commodities and other asset classes...instead of focusing in on what "is"...what's actually happening in the market...that's truth.
336 2018-07-15 05:35:10 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa

342 2018-07-15 04:28:58 El chavismo solo fue sostenible por el boom petrolero durante los 2000. Lo preocupante es que el inicio de su debacle no vino con los casos de corrupcion, con su discurso autoritario o con la destruccion institucional, sino por el desplome de los commodities en los mercados.
343 2018-07-15 04:10:53 @RahulGandhi is not visiting missionaries for charity where new born babies r sold like commodities. Evangelist Sonia Antonio Miano enjoys the sale. No condemnation.  Sale of babies, rapes by Priests n Pastors r being performed with the blessings of Lord who loves mankind n poor.

348 2018-07-15 02:30:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
349 2018-07-15 02:08:19 Nothing bothers me more then when your team is nationally televised, and the broadcasters can’t stop indulging in trade forecasting, treating the players as commodities with zero regard as to the history/culture of the team (or city for that matter). #atleastwewontho
350 2018-07-15 02:04:00 i get the comment's sentiment, but ultimately? viewing people as commodities is a hallmark of sociopathy/antisocial behavior. that isn't normal at all.
351 2018-07-15 02:00:24 Sure. Like starting trade wars with countries that retaliate by placing tariffs on agricultural commodities?
352 2018-07-15 01:52:12 An international political theocracy which makes women, invisible, common, owned commodities with no voice or beauty or personhood. This is Islam. Killer of dreams and freedom and discovery. Hate

356 2018-07-15 00:48:09 Um vendedor de commodities dificilmente teria êxito em uma estratégia de sobretaxação a produtos importados.
357 2018-07-15 00:43:58 The tariff issue is clearly partisan. 
Not along political lines but, economically. Do you want cheap commodities for the short term or a return to a country which is self sufficient with a robust economy. We actually produced stuff here in the past and it wasn't an issue.
358 2018-07-15 00:32:13 Don't get caught without enough capital expended on QB. They can be rare, valuable, and tough to trade for commodities.
359 2018-07-15 00:24:05 Yes, that is the tragedy! They really don't think of the least, the lost an left behind as valued equal to themselves, except as commodities to be used by them and thrown away!

361 2018-07-15 00:14:32 Hi @naval which commodities do you find interesting over the next decade, either from growing scarcity or demand? Not from and investment point of view, just your general opinion. I'm trying to learn a bit more.

409 2018-07-13 20:52:08 This is only true when their production is trivial and their yield is globally abundant, e.g. air and water are abundant in hospitable climes, therefore they are not commodified. Until then, food, shelter, energy, education, transportation, and healthcare will remain commodities.

415 2018-07-13 20:24:07 Jacob how does aligning ourselves to a US regulatory regime help our food producers, you will facilitate import of cheap commodities, export our productive capacity & expose society to more food poisoning, US consumers had 60x more campylobacter cases/100000 head of population
416 2018-07-13 20:21:18 Great, now all I have to do is found out how many kcals are in a metric ton of rice, wheat, corn, barley, oats, rye, teff, millet, sorghum, etc. etc. etc. to check your numbers. 

I'm also going to want to figure out how much carbon has been captured by those commodities.

420 2018-07-13 20:06:13 They are just commodities that have been marketed. It makes me sad that people admire them.

425 2018-07-13 19:38:31 Libya was using its financial resources to underwrite an African currency to be used for extraction and marketing of African commodities. Africa would have been free of Western financials.

Ian has always had a trait of treating women as commodities & it can be traced all the way back to Hattie at meal machine, when he abused his position to take advantage.
428 2018-07-13 19:28:33 No one tweet can dictate a coin to change direction. Your imagination is quite vivid, consider writing children's books instead of treating crypto like commodities.
429 2018-07-13 19:25:34 Dat is een mogelijkheid. Niet de enige. Maar ‘eerlijke prijzen’ zijn ‘n niet bestaande klaagzang. Agro maakt commodities die middels subsidie nooit tekorten laten zien. Dat is een onhoudbaar systeem maar een beter is er (nog) niet. Supermarkten hebben in dat prijssysteem geen rol
430 2018-07-13 19:23:16 Some speculated that it was the fish ban. But I don't know if that had an impact on the other commodities.

474 2018-07-13 16:13:19 It's a shell game used to justify exploitation, their business model is fraud.

Markets have a place, but necessities should never be commodities and markets fail if any entity has the capacity to corner the market.

'Austrian' economics is a cult not a scientific economic theory
475 2018-07-13 16:06:48 Slapping sanctions on commodities will drive the prices of them through the roof directly affecting us; it will make a full blown trade war with China look cheap. Undermining those markets would be far better.
476 2018-07-13 16:06:46 Copper and steel - and therefore by extension coking coal - are leading indicators of future economic activity.  The yuan is, well, a little more complicated.  But suffice to say weaker yuan and weak commodities is often bearish for stocks. IMO

478 2018-07-13 15:54:26 Brasil va en la misma dirección. Igual q Argentina e Indonesia, somoals países importadores de combustibles y exportadores de commodities agrícolas
479 2018-07-13 15:45:27 Wow. Now Federalist weirdos are concerned with treating bodies and souls as material commodities? Does your hypocrisy have a price tag, or does it just come naturally?
480 2018-07-13 15:29:22 Pray for them children.  The Deep State looks at them as commodities, Child Trafficking, Human Sacrifice, Prostitution and probably more horrible acts than I can imagine.  Sick and disgusting people we have among us.
481 2018-07-13 15:26:45 Increased production at reduced production cost Effects
- increased job opportunity as a result of increased industrial activities 
- More Affordable commodities  in the market
482 2018-07-13 15:25:13 Oil prices were set for a second straight week of decline on Friday after Libyan ports reopened and on the view that Iran might still export some crude despite U.S. sanction #oilandgas #brent #crude #crudeoil #Commodities #Commodity #Traders #Trader #Equidiousresearch #pips #PIP
483 2018-07-13 15:22:47 When trade talks appear to fail or a cancellation occurs keep your eyes open for who is back on the buy end when commodities are close to limit lower trade. Market manipulation at its finest and we allow it time after time.
484 2018-07-13 15:22:41 It's the worst in muslim nations. They are treated like commodities. So get a  Hindu husband for better treatment and better life
485 2018-07-13 15:22:40 I meant that as a rhetorical question but you came up with an excellent answer! I think it's the treating humans as commodities that makes me feel modern slavery is the most horrifying crime imaginable.
486 2018-07-13 15:17:58 China has traded commodities since the beginning of time, they are good at what they do. Fair trade can be obtained but policy’s of the past need changing, too many under the table deals have become the standard.
487 2018-07-13 15:17:06 Things other than commodities can be unequal.
488 2018-07-13 15:07:41 Again, not what I said. I said it's what we trade our commodities in and they have a huge bearing on inflation, especially oil prices.
489 2018-07-13 15:04:59 Except, in reality the pound has returned to previous levels against the USD and its the USD that is most important to us because that is what we trade out commodities in. Very misleading.
490 2018-07-13 14:58:59 Know this: that I have faith in our megachurches, our hard-working families and our commodities markets.
491 2018-07-13 14:57:19 Because we care #OOTT .. The Mark Fisher "First 2-Weeks of July High to Low Price Range" ranging period is in place at the close today.
Thousands of global energy traders will be basing directional trades off that range in energies and other commodities for the rest of the year.
492 2018-07-13 14:56:41 I've got too much exposure to commodities already immie ;)
493 2018-07-13 14:53:07 Martin Luther king jr. was working with civil unions on wealth disparity before he was murdered. The true enemy is the distribution of wealth. We citizens are assets and commodities traded between corporations. America is an empire and an invasive dictatorship.
494 2018-07-13 14:51:25 What Commodities are you stocking up on with the trade skirmish between the US and the world?
495 2018-07-13 14:46:43 I agree a bear market is on the horizon, but commodities have just started to rally - not over at all.

505 2018-07-13 13:40:02 So, a group of European globalist elites who have been riding on America’s defense budget, flooding their countries with immigrants & buying mass quantities of essential commodities from NATO’s greatest enemy, think Trump is unstable and unthinking?
506 2018-07-13 13:36:52 Again Nigel, a banker who trades in commodities, always wears a tie and was educated at the fee-paying Dulwich College IS the definition of the Establishment!!!!
507 2018-07-13 13:33:01 You can't have SM and an export market. With our cold climate and expensive labour and distance from market, I don't see Canada being a very large exporter in those commodities. Unless there is something in the economics I am not seeing.
508 2018-07-13 13:32:19 Commodities from beans to corn to copper sure are painting a different picture than inflation.
509 2018-07-13 13:27:02 Like art, poetry is primal & hard to reduce to a concept or technique. I'd strongly argue that paucity is involved though. It condenses language & forces that rarest of commodities to emerge: concentration.
510 2018-07-13 13:24:13 F.A. Hayek on what would define a success of (alternative) currency in "Denationalisation of Money"

There are four kinds of uses of Money that would chiefly affect
the choice among available kinds of currency: its use,· first,
for cash purchases of commodities and services

519 2018-07-13 12:52:35 In this section Mises was referring more to how 'changes in the money relation' i.e. demand for money affects the exchange ratio between money and other commodities. He's pointing out there's no such thing as neutral, stable, money.

526 2018-07-13 12:20:07 Dear Congress, commodities were freely distributed in your time, now we are paying for it. I will vote congress again, they will ensure free commodities or very reasonable price. Your Gove have sold petol in their time Rs 78/leter and Rs 800/cylinder, and Tomato 60/kg.

Enjoy your long lines for goods & commodities & your death panels. This balloon makes you all look foolish. Poland, Italy, Hungary, and more are leaving you in the dust
528 2018-07-13 12:13:08 Great question.  I am looking at this from a micro point of view.  The currency was slightly buoyant because of the Brexit plan. We had contracts ready to sign off today.  Trading actual commodities rather than futures.  When the markets opened and the GBP fell, contracts trashed
529 2018-07-13 12:11:11 Why does it matter the sneerers sneer? Even if there was no Mueller, no detention centres, personal business gains, erratic and aggressive tweeting, women have not campaigned and worked for rights, education, ongoing equality to hear clips like THAT.  Not humans but commodities.

532 2018-07-13 11:46:48 Want economic equality? 
1) Abolish the stock market, futures market, commodities market, etc.
2) Place a cap on annual income, 1M –– no one needs more than that
3) Abolish lobbyists and corporate infringements on politics

540 2018-07-13 11:20:35 Good question! Currency economics works when there are goods to be purchased for a certain price. A reason USD is stable is because commodities like oil are traded in USD.  If USD goes down, then forex traders buy USD and sell to commodities traders which pushes the price back.

553 2018-07-13 09:58:38 There are three reasons for us to separate the current EM status vs. 2013/2014 crisis: US yields increase has been gradual, commodities have been resilient and economic fundamentals (both external deficit and inflation) are in much better shape. @SantanderAM @santanderpb

594 2018-07-13 06:32:10 COPPER: London copper edged lower on Friday and was set for a fifth consecutive week of decline on concerns of weaker demand amid U.S.-China trade war....#Commodities #copper #TradeWars
595 2018-07-13 06:25:43 If $DBC would come back under $15.50, I would probably back up the truck. Heavy enough on oil with enough other commodities in the basket to act as a proper hedge.
596 2018-07-13 06:16:32 I think the economic managers of the President should reach out to the poor, whether in urban centers and in the countryside, to know their concerns in the 5.4% rising inflation rate on basic commodities and I am challenging them also to go to the markets to see for themselves
597 2018-07-13 06:05:27 Family planning is a human right. All nations must ensure that family planning commodities and services are accessible to and available for everyone. Ministries of health should ensure this service are available, child birth should be a choice not mistake #WPD2018NG #FP50 #FP4All

599 2018-07-13 05:36:43 Oh, I know they have instructions, but I’d rather know it by heart (same for EpiPens), so that I’m not reading instead of administering when time is critical.

Just time/money. I’m a retail wage slave atm, so both are precious commodities right now.
600 2018-07-13 05:32:06 Koon's art is LITERALLY what Capitalist Realism looks like. It's just a regurgitation of commodities from a nostolgic past as a warped and twisted aftereffect, It's what happens to culture when we're just, stuck.
it's fucking shit

608 2018-07-13 04:54:48 If they are treated as commodities, will GST be applicable? Seems foolish but a possibility.
609 2018-07-13 04:50:00 Kenyans, the budget that was read by Rotich last month seems not to favour common mwananchi as new taxes push up prices of basic commodities like food. What strategies are you using to stay afloat?
610 2018-07-13 04:43:41 Taxes are not only what you file and return to Kra, we pay taxes by buying about anything because nowadays all basic commodities are taxed.
611 2018-07-13 04:10:41 I mean, it's Twitter, so boy/bot/Cylon/bawling man-child are all pretty interchangeable commodities.

.What about launchings/inaugrations on controls on steep daily increase of essential commodities pl.
613 2018-07-13 03:55:11 I got 2 kids. Both graduated from college. I started working, kid, when I was 15. I worked retail and fast food. I worked as a sports writer for college. Ended up military. Got my degree, my certs, skilled up in trading Futures and commodities (hence the name).

615 2018-07-13 03:38:52 That’s the key! We have policies in place that actively make them assets, instead of commodities.
616 2018-07-13 03:20:35 if the poverty income level is $12k wouldn't giving everyone $12k increase the poverty threshold to 24k through price increases of rent, food and other commodities and services?

620 2018-07-13 02:59:35 If they are commodities...
621 2018-07-13 02:49:33 The relative exchange rate of commodities is not constant. This is why value is subjective.
622 2018-07-13 02:30:51 Obviously, intelligence and experience are unnecessary commodities in the GOP.
623 2018-07-13 02:24:05 Not really. Honestly gold is not really on my radar right now. I just assume I’ll buy it closer $800 in a few years once commodities really bottom out. The current downturn is pretty tame across the whole complex tbh. The hyperbole around the monetary system is unnecessary
624 2018-07-13 02:21:12 What can be said about "a very smart businessman" and Wharton graduate who doesn't understand trade deficits, cross-trading, and that trade involves both tangible (goods) and intangible (services) commodities.
625 2018-07-13 02:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
626 2018-07-13 02:04:02 That is literally the Million $ question. I think as equitable recources and exposure becomes tangible for Us, we'll get there. We have to be willing to demand equality in our feilds+marketplaces 
and become commodities ourselves too.
627 2018-07-13 01:54:07 Agrotóxicos não são problema,são parte da solução.Como o BR se tornou competitivo no mundo de commodities agricolas?! Agrotóxicos combatem pragas, reduzem o custo de produção,aumentam competitividade.Isso nao significa usar os mais atrasados, poluentes,s/ assistência técnica .
628 2018-07-13 01:50:53 You have to remove the value of raw commodities exports like oil & gas to understand this better
629 2018-07-13 01:44:42 Well yes. That happens when the fashionable set decides to declare consumer commodities & services to be human rights, needing to be paid for by someone, anyone, else.
630 2018-07-13 01:43:39 And CA dept of Pub Health has outlawed hemp derived cbd in food and cannabis edibles. That should mess w the canna flower commodities market not to mention cbd water slingers
631 2018-07-13 01:41:55 #Stockmarket #Gold and Commodities very weak. My take is because of dollar and pullback of rates on #TNX showing slowing of world growth. Gold will move when dollar weakens and not before .
632 2018-07-13 01:33:03 For get it they are too stupid to care about civil rights or pesky laws they are in a hurry to get in the Putin/Trump waiting line to buy simple commodities.
633 2018-07-13 01:32:49 "India is not going to put a blanket ban on digital currencies, but rather treat them as commodities"

- an anonymous senior source in the government who is aware of the discussions
634 2018-07-13 01:28:26 Well my holdings in a soft commodities ETF continues to slide in the wrong  direction but I'm staying long. So I'd appreciate it if you all bought an extra loaf of bread. Ask for sugar on top too :)
635 2018-07-13 01:21:49 Fitzie you need a reality check, Ag in Aus is Maginal farming practice, on marginal lands, on marginal soils under marginal climatic conditions of marginal value commodities soon to be marginally challenged by black farming? Marginal regulation ain’t going to help. #auspol
636 2018-07-13 00:54:22 So we're agreed. Greyhounds are over bred, mis-treated, viewed as commodities, and then killed and the entire industry should be investigated.

Glad we got it sorted.
