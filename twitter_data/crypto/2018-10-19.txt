c0banの価格が下がったからって、LastRoots社に文句言ってるやついるけど、感覚やべえな。
CCハッキング事件のときNEMの価格下がったからって訴訟してた集団より感覚やばい。
近々、海外取引所にも上場するらしいから、価格下がったらそこの取引所にもちゃんと文句言えよｗ

49 2018-10-20 23:58:16 To be honest I don't expect instant price rise when #Bakkt launches. We've been in downtrend since the past 8 months and to rise from the ashes, it takes time.
Stay in it long term and you'll reap the kind of benefits previous generations have never witnessed.
