1 2019-05-22 23:59:26 Thief?  Apparently you’ve overlooked the ones who became multimillionaires after they came to DC.  Pelosi, Feinstein, Waters - all grifters. Or just lucky at picking stocks or family business who hit the DC jackpot.

8 2019-05-22 23:55:23 Like anything else in trading the answer depends. NQ will certainly run my more then the ES depending on the FANGS and other more volatile tech stocks. Also the NQ is 100 stocks. ES has 500 in it. I would think the broader index will run less. When we move the NQ really moves

17 2019-05-22 23:50:54 I doubt it would affect Supermicro stocks, but it would cause a cascade reaction against other suppliers and subcontractors to go under heavier scrutiny by the parent company to ensure things like this don't happen again.
