4 2018-05-28 23:59:03 I had a long conversation with a rancher, whose land I was working on (surveying a pipeline). He's been approached by a windmill company. The land owners found out the hard way that dealing with wind companies is much worse than dealing with oil companies.

12 2018-05-28 23:58:06 Or a BC Ferry or maybe a cruise ship. Vancouver has 60 plus (all I could count from the plane) sitting around everyday plus cruise ship traffic..... oh and the bitumen is diluted. And there are already oil tankers in and out of the area and have been for years-any spills??
13 2018-05-28 23:58:02 Do you think your taxes only go to help the poor, children and the elderly?  If it did it would be a good use of the funds.  Corporate welfare, subsidies for Big Oil and mega farms.  Not to mention Businesses making record profits but pay their workers welfare wages.

51 2018-05-28 23:54:23 BC Prem Horgan to KM&AB: No KM pipline!

Province of AB: Fine, we’re shutting off the oil taps to BC.

Horgan: YOU CAN’T DO THAT! I’M SUING YOU TO KEEP OIL FLOWING HERE.

AB & KM: it’s beneficial for both of us to have the pipeline.

Horgan: I DON’T WANT IT!

53 2018-05-28 23:54:21 This is awful public policy. Whether you agree w increasing oil sands output or favour pipelines over rail for moving bitumen to market, giving public monies to a profitable US pipeline company whose business model includes minimizing taxes paid in Canada, is a bloody scandal!
54 2018-05-28 23:54:18 Wah .. you guys don’t have funds to run @KElectricPk on OIL or pay off @SSGC_Official  payments and doing load shedding all over Karachi . In parallel donating such labs . Wah wah .

57 2018-05-28 23:53:59 It seems you attribute all the blame for the people's suffering to Maduro, but what of US imperialism and capitalism (some 66% of economy) within Venezuela? Does Maduro manipulate oil markets, impose harsh sanctions, or hoard and burn food stores? Whose is the legacy of coup?
58 2018-05-28 23:53:49 Alhamdulillah
59 2018-05-28 23:53:34 I slept to 1:30 in the afternoon today....

64 2018-05-28 23:52:14 This is the simple mind of a #Resist sheep. Remember what we’re dealing with here. They’re not the most informed people.
65 2018-05-28 23:52:12 Don’t go by BC or Alberta.  When the stimulus runs out as the World Bank says it will - what then. The oil sands are dead.  ???  Who knows.
66 2018-05-28 23:52:11 Interesting he didn’t put his branch in his bio. Most Intel guys are high speed no matter how far behind the lines they serve. Even direct commission officers understand their assigned weapon. I would suspect he is just another liar trying to get votes by duping New Yorkers.
67 2018-05-28 23:51:55 Recession doesn't start overnight, it started in 2014, even though we experienced oil boom a year, two years before then!

69 2018-05-28 23:51:34 I'm weird with olives. I love olive oil and olive bread but hate olives themselves. I don't get the big deal. Salty slimy ick. Hate anything pickled too!
70 2018-05-28 23:51:25 When i do my coconut oil hair treatment it looks like I'm putting donut glaze on my head. It also smells like that
71 2018-05-28 23:51:25 Wahabbism is a specific set of violent principles that were spread in the Islamic world by Saudi Arabia and the US to turn their religious fundamentalism into a weapon against secular left-wing governments who might try to nationalize oil.

77 2018-05-28 23:50:39 Eucalyptus burning is essentially an oil fire. Apart from various hydrocarbons, CO and CO2 in the combustion products, there’s also heaps of particulate matter. We have laws against it in cities.

86 2018-05-28 23:49:35 Because oil price is rising! Useless deceits!
87 2018-05-28 23:49:35 I’m surprised this is not in the news... an oil spill in Vancouer by the COV.
88 2018-05-28 23:49:15 I repeat all natural tea tree oil does wonders man my scalp currently is healing and the tea tree oil is helping it heal.
89 2018-05-28 23:49:15 I have to admit that La Bella  avacado oil max hold gel is amazing and works way better than eco styler (for me and it smells like watermelon jolly ranchers) I completely get what your saying lol. Black twitter/web can be even more toxic than whatever ingredients are in eco.
90 2018-05-28 23:49:13 @Imogin I don't know why I didn't ask about the most obvious one, have you tried to nail down the CBD oil that may work on what type of cancer you have?
91 2018-05-28 23:49:10 If its pure CBD oil, then it most likely wouldn't come from hemp processing, but rather extracted from cannabis sativa. CBD's interaction with receptors in the brain do not produce a psychoactive response, so do not get you high as with THC (active chemical when smoking weed).
92 2018-05-28 23:49:05 is it okay if I buang dulu light makeup using micellar water, then before I want to wash my face with the cleanser, I guna cleansing oil?

96 2018-05-28 23:48:47 I tried that but it didn’t seem to help as much as the coconut oil and aloe! Might have to use it again though!! 
97 2018-05-28 23:48:39 I oil my scalp today and now it dry nf

99 2018-05-28 23:47:35 And Auto Shop. My dad taught me how to change car tires, change oil and oil filter, air filter, spark plugs and wires, and how to balance the checkbook!! Mom taught me to sew, they both taught cooking. See how well the 2 parent home works? Its good for society.

101 2018-05-28 23:47:30 This sort of Saudis hatred of Tommi Robinson must be stopped. The world bows to the Sunni Saudis because of oil & their wealth! Fk 'em!

103 2018-05-28 23:47:20 There’s nothing I hate more than oil that pops up out of a skillet when you’re cooking chicken 
104 2018-05-28 23:47:18 ingredients for a well-oiled machine:

1) an excess of oil

c) a machine
105 2018-05-28 23:47:12 Can you please do something about the price gouging that goes on in this country? Everyone does it from the  oil companies to the mom and pop grocery stores and it needs to stop.
106 2018-05-28 23:47:02 And the economic news report that Indonesian share prices are a better investment because they can expand more plantations than Malaysian companies - that means West Papua is only considered as prime palm oil expansion territory, not tribal lands or pristine primary forest
107 2018-05-28 23:46:59 God bless the coconut oil isn’t absolutely disgusting and actually somewhat tolerable in these smoothies
108 2018-05-28 23:46:56 Can we drop workout routines instead of coconut oil skin care routine

113 2018-05-28 23:46:13 These oil and gas folks just see the West as a gigantic wasteland just like the first whites to see the Grand Canyon did. As Buffy St. Marie wrote "virgin places don't mean a thing to people who never bring their hearts along" #SaveOurLands #LeaveItInTheGround
114 2018-05-28 23:45:51 Afraid of the naked truth in what they see. It's ugly. And the fact that we're right about it really yanks their collective chains. And how is a guy my age able to be such a provocative artist? Only hipsters from SoHo are allowed that talent.
115 2018-05-28 23:45:48 Agreed, its just like ordering c60 oil last year. Nun the less, you dont sell as "in stock" if it isnt. I just wanted to mention it so ur followers would b aware and not waste valuable time.
116 2018-05-28 23:45:39 All I seen was an oil. Not nearly enough products for my liking
117 2018-05-28 23:45:12 A bot must not heat the oil in a large skillet.
A bot must not be pleasant.
A bot must not consume adequate amounts of protein daily.

119 2018-05-28 23:45:05 Cover me in olive oil and ask me to cough gently to dislodge some phlegm.
120 2018-05-28 23:45:00 I hope @jassybarra uses her tanning oil this weekend when we go to the pool and tan.. so I can peel her the next day 
121 2018-05-28 23:44:34 I don't like their coffee to begin with, their prices, nor the attitude of the help and I don't like the smell of patchouli oil either. And I carry a gun. Won't be going anytime soon.
122 2018-05-28 23:44:18 @tferriss really enjoyed reading about your experience with CBD oil in the most recent #5bulletfriday. My wife suffers from infrequent but terrible sleep anxiety and this recently came on my radar. Interested to hear your thoughts on other applications explored.
123 2018-05-28 23:44:16 Venezuela represents a major part of the US oil imports. Citgo refinery supplies its fuel stations and other customers with gasoline and diesel fuels. In other words Citgo is intergrated into the US energy economy. Damage it and you damage US consumers.

133 2018-05-28 23:43:04 Fracking is an unsafe process that harms our drinking water and health. ... Fracking pollutes our air and drinking water, hurts communities, worsens climate change, and is linked to earthquakes. It is unacceptable that the oil and gas industry profits off fracking at our expense.
134 2018-05-28 23:42:55 Put in either deep conditioner or coconut oil and let it soak for a day, then rinse it out and it’ll be easier to brush. I’m so sorry

150 2018-05-28 23:41:27 Oil money is the lazy cop out, it doesn’t matter where the money comes from. It’s what you get in return results wise. I expect Liverpool to be City’s biggest challengers next year, which I think is a fair expectation.

154 2018-05-28 23:41:08 Days after US pulls out of Iran deal, UAE and Russia agree to sell much more crude oil to offset the shortage created by the US sanctions against Iran - both asked Trump to drop out of deal - now they are profiting from this move.
155 2018-05-28 23:41:07 Plenty of options for Oil Kings replacements. Go with former pros or go with those who have paid dues?
156 2018-05-28 23:41:05 Weird how they do that, they changed yyc’s logo from “heart of the west” to “be part of the energy” right as oil took a dump and everyone got laid off, they should change it to “be part of the recession” lolz
157 2018-05-28 23:41:01 Yup.  In the oil and gas industry.  First line of defense to keep the lights on.
158 2018-05-28 23:40:56 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
159 2018-05-28 23:40:55 This is easily the worst Baseline Road traffic snarl I've been in since moving to Sherwood Park 4 years ago. We left Telus House/ATB Place bus-stop at 4:24. It's now over an hour later + we're still not at the Imperial Oil Refinery. Avoid EB Baseline at all costs! #yegtraffic
160 2018-05-28 23:40:55 Q ganas de juntarme con toda mi gente en la oil
161 2018-05-28 23:40:49 You have been inhaling too much of that aromatic oil!
162 2018-05-28 23:40:42 Never went to chicken oil, and Gumby’s is good especially on Tuesdays.. I’m not a huge Double Dave’s fan so if I’m going pizza rolls I would probably go Gumby’s.
163 2018-05-28 23:40:32 BTW, I’m not liberal, I’m progressive. I think renewable energy is better for the planet and will create more sustainable jobs than coal, oil, and gasoline. I think we have a gun problem in this country that needs to be addressed. Racism is an issue too. And Trump is an asshole.

175 2018-05-28 23:39:34 Oh looks less polluting machines in the world guzzling up that oil. What role does oil play in the inner earth ecosystem and can water really replace it ??? Diesel £1.32 per litre today Who can afford that ???
176 2018-05-28 23:39:33 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.

186 2018-05-28 23:38:27 More spin. Don’t know about the supposed bill but the “tax cut” is now being eaten up by higher oil prices etc.  oh and those bonuses were ONE TIME, ooh big time....I’m sure we regular folks are all better off. NOT. Thanks Donald and all your sycophants.
187 2018-05-28 23:37:58 So am I stupid or something ? Price of a barrel of oil goes up .... price at the pump goes up .... barrel goes down .... price still the same.  Is it me or am I missing something here ?  #GasWar #gas

191 2018-05-28 23:37:32 Who thought the oil get pounded
192 2018-05-28 23:37:31 Day by day the govt increasing the rates of petrolium oil because politicions are know that petrolium is the nesseasary needable thing..i want to say the govt that they will reduse rates of petrolium if they wouldn't they will pay for this in this future..

195 2018-05-28 23:37:13 So in love with my essential oil diffuser. Will definitely post on the blog soon!
196 2018-05-28 23:37:07 Fuel price increment, subsidy removal, forex floating & many other decisions of this govt are necessary painful sacrifice we should have made 30 yrs ago.

Unfortunately, btwn 2010 & 2015, fortune smiled on us & we earned over $500b oil revenue, it was another opportunity missed
197 2018-05-28 23:36:56 I needa peeeeeeeeeeeeee but I’m getting an oil change and there’s no banyo here bakit why
198 2018-05-28 23:36:51 Absolutely. Coated them in olive oil, salt pepper, garlic salt and and shit load of parmesan. Put them on high heat. The Spears get legit crunchy. So good.
199 2018-05-28 23:36:49 Ur a perfect example of a female w genitals!
200 2018-05-28 23:36:40 "Americans have little or no context" = spot on

Good Norwegian series called 'Occupied' involves a Russian takeover of Norwegian oil supplies in the near future (Netflix). Lots of politics, starts out slow, but looks at many sides of the issues; different POVs.

Yup when manmohan Singh was demiting office in 2014 barrel oil is 140$. Now , it is 80$ but the rupee rate is the same......20 state govt out of 29 are BJP run...so what is stopping the Bonda BJP party to reduce excise taxes....
205 2018-05-28 23:36:12 I really am just making and drinking smoothies for the health benefits haha

207 2018-05-28 23:35:48 Last day of my vacation (post-edc) diet  I ate a bag of chip every day the past 3 days, a fried chicken sandwich, spaghetti with as much olive oil and cheese as I wanted, endless beers, $20 of Taco Bell, a large pizza from dominos, and a bucket of sherbet. #back2summerbody

220 2018-05-28 23:33:52 takes us up to a net spend of 36m since Klopp arrived; 13m a year - yes, oil money!!!
221 2018-05-28 23:33:30 Looks like the "buy the dip" idiots are here for a quickie. No wonder the MMs and their mediums keep repeating narratives (while selling off little by little in a sneaky way). They know that there are plenty of dumb dumbs in the oil market!
222 2018-05-28 23:33:29 i feel like smoking weed is way much better than this thc oil pen
223 2018-05-28 23:33:15 Kicked out a bum putting olive oil on herself,  had a legit line down the aisle of customers, and meat manager quit, just another Monday lol
224 2018-05-28 23:33:10 Oil can be very profitable daily up or down
225 2018-05-28 23:32:55 Yo! When you let the stew rest and the oil just surfaces  you can make a whole East African stew with that oil.

235 2018-05-28 23:30:58 Awww thanks dee 
236 2018-05-28 23:30:49 That was not the case 70-100 yrs ago. Arabs had every chance to start on an equal footing with the Jews. Arab oil money was already flowing & could have laid the foundation for an agrarian economy. But the Arabs, first under Hajj Amin al-Husseini, then Arafat opted for terror.
237 2018-05-28 23:30:40 We are no where near rich but have seen our paychecks increased since the tax cut! And I remember over $4 gal gas under Obama! Thats why we shouldnt depend on foreogn oil but libs dont want drilling in our US fields! Dems want to punish hard working tax payers. Thats bad for CO!
238 2018-05-28 23:30:36 Let my dead grandfather rest in peace. Do no speak for him. He volunteered to fight in World War II at age 35 and was stationed on a PT Boat in active combat. He never glorified the war or his participation in it and he despised slimy, hypocritical snake oil salesmen like you.

The old "slipped on an ambiguous shape" routine, huh? Just oil it up an' take it slow.
243 2018-05-28 23:30:21 Avocado oil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, olive oil, any oil mixed together or on their own tbh. Adding honey feels nasty but when you wash it out your hair is so soft and shiny

263 2018-05-28 23:27:55 100l  isn't two tanks on a Honda Civic. Truth matters and spills should be addressed small or not. "Cleaned up" isn't the same. You can't 100% clean up oil spills
264 2018-05-28 23:27:52 Used to be. But then we old folks screwed up everything up according to the kids that never had a checkbook, no idea how to sew, sits on the curb and cries over a flat, never check oil, cannot cook and still live in the basement of the house I built, by hand.

272 2018-05-28 23:26:20 I like mine in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) with some light garlic salt. Less seasoning is more for me, in general and especially with vegetables.
273 2018-05-28 23:26:17 Imagine #gasprices if the Dems were still in charge of our energy policy? Thanks to @realDonaldTrump America has become a net exporter of oil in this booming industry.Remember how the Dems told us for decades that America couldn’t drill its way to energy independence?Wrong again!

280 2018-05-28 23:25:44 Wow, that's so neat. My blog was pretty much a Frightened Rabbit fanzine at times. There's a video I recorded of them playing The Oil Slick (well, the last half of it) with the RSNO orchestra in Paisley Abbey that I really should upload.
281 2018-05-28 23:25:44 She is a recent CDN, born and raised in the USA and based on her stance on keeping our oil land locked that benefits her home country she is still very much aligned with the USA.

295 2018-05-28 23:23:46 Lol that day that your boys were busy doing 30naira gang for you Shey. I was like haaa this guy is so famous.
296 2018-05-28 23:23:44 I like any time with you. -guides you off me and heads to the bed with you. Stripping us both down before going about lighting the candles and dimming the lights in here. Grabbing our massage oil-
297 2018-05-28 23:23:26 The last thing our country needs is the Liberals  controlling the volume put through the pipelines. They will restrict volunes and in turn destroy the oil industry based on their ideolgy vs logic.
298 2018-05-28 23:23:19 oil slick is so fucking cool and if I got my hair done more than annually I'd do it.

300 2018-05-28 23:23:06 Have the #SHRBowl on @PokerGO while making dinner. Deciding how much olive oil to use, I imagine guidance via the dulcet tones of @NickSchulman: “Not sure I’m too excited about that sizing, Ali, but you know what they say, in this life some of us prefer the road less traveled...”
301 2018-05-28 23:23:06 rub some peppermint oil on your nape and temples it’ll do wonders or take excedrin

305 2018-05-28 23:22:39 Research suggests that a lot of modern illnesses/ailments can be helped by cbd oil as before weed was restricted livestock etc were fed hemp so we got cbd through our meat/dairy etc. It's a very interesting concept!
306 2018-05-28 23:22:29 You need some coconut oil & a lot could change in 4 weeks  (am not done yet)

315 2018-05-28 23:21:20 Not at all; in fact what he was saying was in reply to "powerful people" (presumably the oil industry) controlling a significant amount of media. The Jewish implication was put on by others who didn't or couldn't see the previous tweets. Disappointing from @glinner to perpetuate

324 2018-05-28 23:20:32 As I pointed out, India should be playing its own interest, and not just the price of oil. Joining democracies instead of a bunch of dictatorships' motives.
325 2018-05-28 23:20:27 Is there something you don't like the taste of you can run on your fingers ? Some type of oil

327 2018-05-28 23:19:59 I'm not gonna lie, last time I was shopping and saw coconut oil at the grocery store, I thought "butt stuff"
328 2018-05-28 23:19:54 My mom found black seed oil that’ll fit in my purse. Im happy.

331 2018-05-28 23:19:38 When I was in jr high it was called home economics. I loved it, so did the boys but boys did have shop. To teach boys how to change oil, tires & build a shelf or a table.

333 2018-05-28 23:19:26 I have had massive benefits from cbd oil. It's really helped my fibromyalgia pain. I would highly reccomend CBD brothers blue oil (you can get a free sample if you email them).

335 2018-05-28 23:19:19 That reminds me of the time that they invited a Kennedy to speak about income equality.

337 2018-05-28 23:19:16 and the fact that most of them were drafted and didn’t wanna be there, locals in other countries said they had no structure and even “walked like they had freedom” or some shit, shows they’re just normal people not tryna kill others for oil and shit
338 2018-05-28 23:19:02 Dnt worry thats how d truth feels
339 2018-05-28 23:18:55 I guess I am the odd one out because I never really liked him before, always thought he was some loser

Then a few years later I saw what im assuming was of him pouring hot oil over his crotch
340 2018-05-28 23:18:53 Yes because if someone is against shipping unrefined oil to China that means theyre against oil as a whole. Like I said, that logic. You're either with the oil gods, or against them!
341 2018-05-28 23:18:52 Hogg is asking for money? Really? Can you provide any sources for this? That sounds like you just made it up.

345 2018-05-28 23:18:21 They can’t cuz roads are made with oil and apparently oil is a no no in Canada
346 2018-05-28 23:18:18 I agree. And it’s sad
347 2018-05-28 23:18:02 Unless the government starts investing in creating a major strategic oil reserve that can dump into the markets at will
348 2018-05-28 23:17:58 When i was little i told my parents a guy came in my room while i was sleeping and told me to hurt myself and other people.....we had anointing oil place in the corners of our house since this happened
349 2018-05-28 23:17:42 If I mess up in oil, depending on the level of heck up, I either try to scrub it off or I just have to work on another portion of the painting and wait for that to dry and start again

355 2018-05-28 23:16:42 it's okay, BC prefers imported US oil and fuel and doesn't mind when they spill. May, Craigie, Horgan et al will not be concerned.

363 2018-05-28 23:15:11 @SajeWellness Hello! What's the typical shelf-life of your high grade lavender oil? I think mine has gone off. :(
364 2018-05-28 23:15:06 all of y’all care about the environment until you realize the fashion industry is second to oil in hurting it
365 2018-05-28 23:14:59 Looks to me like Mr. Crown Prince had his chain yanked and he’s done an in-country about face.  What Saudi really needs is a Crown Princess to effect real change.  Selling lots of oil doesn’t seem to help if a country is still floundering in the dark ages.
366 2018-05-28 23:14:53 Can you imagine being part of a giant DNA database?  that's their goal...
367 2018-05-28 23:14:50 before making any important decision I ask my oil pen what it thinks
368 2018-05-28 23:14:43 I've run diesel tradie vans and they are a noisy, smelly, powerless, high maintenance waste of time. At least PM Kevin Rudd used to look after the Australian public by curbing blatant profiteering by oil companies.
369 2018-05-28 23:14:36 Wouldn’t be surprised if KM does walk away from this mess. In that case, oil sector can say goodbye to any foreign company ever investing a $ here.
370 2018-05-28 23:14:30 it took me until year 3 to finally start making decent money. i hoarded almost everything i found and then started crafting mayo/cheese/truffle oil machines and they helped me big time. i finally have the greenhouse so i have one ancient fruit growing and a bunch of starfruit
371 2018-05-28 23:14:21 They're offering snake oil, but unlike the Remain establishment, they appear to be offering something different to people who've been hammered by the status quo for years.

We'll only win these people back from the right by offering a different change based on hope, not fear.
372 2018-05-28 23:14:16 so i discovered this african pride honey, chocolate, and coconut oil conditioner and when i tell y’all it’s giving me so much life right now!
373 2018-05-28 23:14:04 @MatPatGT Hello from France. Burnt my hands and front arms with boiling oil that bursted on fire. No damage besides myself. Watching #GTlive help me forget I wear bandages warm as gloves in june (almost). Can I get a clap and a half?
374 2018-05-28 23:13:58 Yeah, Einstein. Coal is certainly where the future is. At least, until we can get the whale oil industry back on its feet.
375 2018-05-28 23:13:41 Let them also reduce the price

379 2018-05-28 23:13:14 How brave of him to do this all the way out there in Quebec. Let's see him stand up in an oil industry shareholders meeting board room in Calgary with that same announcement. Or perhaps Fort Murray would be a better venue.

392 2018-05-28 23:11:59 @TuckerGoodrich seed oil & IBS....hmm. I wish i could convince hubby of the issues w/seed oils. He limits them simply due to my cooking but still eats far too much of them via processed foods.He's you back in the TP to go everywhere phase. He does find cannibis helps his IBS tho
393 2018-05-28 23:11:44  don’t be like this
394 2018-05-28 23:11:33 Gas prices should start falling.  Main reason; Saudis are pumping more into the market.  OK APES kids, why would the Saudis effectively want to decrease the world price of oil...?  Two reasons.
395 2018-05-28 23:11:19 I miss them $35-45 oil changes
396 2018-05-28 23:11:12 Hardly. 
For India no oil is cheaper than Iran’s; India has invested billions in Charbahar and the road network to Central Asia; in case of war India has access to Iranian Ports; close intelligence cooperation with Iran against Taliban, etc. Why risk it all?
397 2018-05-28 23:10:58 The price of oil and inflation has already eaten away most of it.  After the 2020 election your tax bracket goes higher than it was before, but the top end keeps their cuts.  You’ve been scammed to keep your vote.

402 2018-05-28 23:10:20 DGPC still doesn't granted them the right to act as regulatory authority. Regarding drilling of wells, they have two blocks awarded, and for oil and gas exploration, the initial exploration lease is for five years which means after 5 years are in position to drill a well or not.

436 2018-05-28 23:06:09 If you have a slow cooker just throw some chicken breast in there for about four hours. Season it. Shred it. Bake diced red potatoes at 425 covered in olive oil, salt and pepper for about 15 minutes. Add broccoli, or or any other veggie. Place in Tupperware. Refrigerate. Goodluck
437 2018-05-28 23:06:09 Never leave me to fry plantain...I eat half of it before it reach the oil
438 2018-05-28 23:06:04 Why the petrol price continues to go up when the world oil price continues to go down is one of life's great mysteries. #whytho
439 2018-05-28 23:04:52 Drives me even battier when people brag about their fake bake or showing off slathered in sun tanning oil.  Cancer is not pretty.

444 2018-05-28 23:04:12 Aveno face wash, witch hazel, & coconut oil. Face masks, try to do at least once every week or depending on your skin and invest in a facial spin brush, it will do wonders to your skin. I have the clarisonic mia 2.
445 2018-05-28 23:03:54 Do what I did Saturday. I pre-pooed my hair with coconut oil , detangled it , and twisted those sections. Shampooed my hair in twists then I do the those twist out and did my styling
446 2018-05-28 23:03:49 Shame we havn't used are Oil money yet 
447 2018-05-28 23:03:37 When I let go of the blade bar-for lack of any small motor language skills. The blades continue to drive and thus shave off the star shaped mower adapter and then the thing doesn’t work because it’s not held in place. Starts hitting the sides. Replaced the Air filter, belt, oil
448 2018-05-28 23:03:32 Peppers! C'mon man smoked Paprika is a classic. Also try thai hot peppers smoked and then rendered into chili oil. But props for realizing that fish is usually better cold-smoked.
449 2018-05-28 23:03:22 I personally don't believe the USA should get into other country's business. Leave them to deal with their own sh*t. You're right about oil we've been covering for Saudi Arabia for too long
450 2018-05-28 23:03:19 Different seeds with differing FA composotions, different oil extraction methods, more or less refining and different oil refining methods, etc. = not all seed oils are created equal
451 2018-05-28 23:03:17 @realDonaldTrump if they can  right a cruise ship bigger  from her side . then bring up the Arizona in and all  the steel and oil . and clean up , we need no more black eye of death from stupid idiot people and to keep showing the world just how stupid we are on Dec- 7- 1941 !!!!
452 2018-05-28 23:03:13 I'm guessing the number of searches for 'CBD oil' on Amazon just skyrocketed (which I admit I've contributed to)

455 2018-05-28 23:02:52 He must be after the Italian vote. Wait a minute! Ferraris are gas guzzlers and leave a large carbon foot print, don't they? If so, then this guy must be colluding with oil companies and hates the environment!

490 2018-05-28 22:58:15 Well EBM suffers from the flaw of averages, a person is not a statistic or printout. Medicine had a long history of snake oil.

527 2018-05-28 22:52:56 Keep in mind, we rely heavily (much to my dismay) on a single particular energy source: petroleum. It delivers everything to every store. It takes most to work. We learned this in the ‘73-‘74 oil embargo. Oil prices affect everything.

532 2018-05-28 22:52:05 It’s not taxes. It’s global crude oil prices and weaking Indian rupee. Taxes on crude have been high since many decades due to fact that very few people pay income tax so tax on fuel is a way to collect tax indirectly.

534 2018-05-28 22:51:53 I had 12 years of public school and didn't know any of that after graduation.  Had I gone to trade school I would have picked up a few important things.

535 2018-05-28 22:51:47 How many have been sacrificed for money?  Oil is not the problem.  It is greed and the human condition - and when oil is obsolete, things won’t be any better.

542 2018-05-28 22:51:16 Cold War era conflicts were waged in defense of capitalism, modern Middle Eastern invasions have been waged in the name of imperialism, to build military bases and/or oil pipelines. Reactionaries have a deep & profound ignorance of how the world works.

545 2018-05-28 22:50:59 Have you researched holistic methods? I use #doterra essential oils and local honey. Using local honey made with local pollen helps you fight it in a natural way. Hot tea with essential oil and local honey feels good on your throat and works against the allergies!!

553 2018-05-28 22:49:11 I doubt that is the main reason.  Rising global crude oil prices and weaking Indian rupee are the main drivers. Taxes haven’t changed.

564 2018-05-28 22:47:56 Price of crude oil sold in future - July 2018 - are down $6. Retail prices usually follow any change in global futures crude oil prices by a few weeks. Price in India will also depend on price of Indian rupee.
565 2018-05-28 22:47:42 Whoever in control control of the oil/gas prices... JUST WAIT TILL I GOT SOMETHING YOU NEED MY NIGGA $41.14 for one of whatever it is. Bastards  lol

567 2018-05-28 22:47:40 NO THE PEOPLE OWN THOSE PIPELINES NOT ANYONE ELSE THE PEOPLE IT'S THEIR OIL
568 2018-05-28 22:47:31 Proverbs 27:9 (Amp) Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; so does the sweetness of a friend's counsel that comes from the heart.
569 2018-05-28 22:47:25 *hits oil rig* bc we a bunch of dibble dabbers
570 2018-05-28 22:47:23 We do what we can do. On a per capita basis we emit more than the US. Canola oil is gluten free, and can be used as a fuel, though it is expensive unless you get it cheaply after chips have been fried in it. ;-)

575 2018-05-28 22:46:33 There’s just no substitute for olive oil!
576 2018-05-28 22:46:22 And yes I feel entitled. This is my country as much as it is the oil companies and mining companies and bankers and all the others who take the resources and don't pay their fair share. I'm entitled to benefit from what they take as much as they are.
577 2018-05-28 22:46:21 Today we ran out of olive oil. When I told Wesley I was going to the store to get some, he suggested using vegetable oil instead. VEGETABLE OIL. My ancestors are rolling in their graves over my marrying this man, I’m sure.
578 2018-05-28 22:46:04 Not sure if you've ever tried it, but you should try it with a little truffle oil drizzled over the potatoes prior to baking. Delicious!
579 2018-05-28 22:45:40 How many jobs does the oil sector support? Why no invitation to explore the reclamation of land by the oil sector which is opening up new wilderness?
580 2018-05-28 22:45:34 Breakouts and oil control
581 2018-05-28 22:45:28 Yes remember me @realDonaldTrump and build the military so more of our brave Americans die in war. Wars now for rare earths and oil friendly whatever not national security.

585 2018-05-28 22:45:14 I would suggest don’t make petrol prices a political issue. In the short term global crude oil prices in US dollars & Indian rupee price in US dollars are both outside control of govt. Having said that Indian govt hasn’t taken enough steps to make lectric vehicles mainstream.
586 2018-05-28 22:45:13 It's sick.. They use tactics to keep base fearing something.. Muslims, Mexicans, commies.. Whatever. In the background they feed the lobbyists and cut checks to oil companies and the rich.. Talk about handouts. Republicans are crooks!!
587 2018-05-28 22:45:12 Oil has a false price, speculation and political pressure. The real price is below u$s 50. The market economy and free trade by fair means, the right way.

594 2018-05-28 22:43:21 No the Koch Brothers pays billions to politicians and so does oil lobby, hence why the oil companies get straight up taxpayer checks.. How us that not a handouts. Straight up check!! Corporate welfare.  Republicans do it and keep feeding thier base BS about minorities.

597 2018-05-28 22:43:12 OK Lefty. Are they in Mosul? Are they in Raqqa? Are they in Iraq at all? Are they exporting oil? Do they have their own TV Stations? Are they taping beheadings or burning people alive or Yazidi female slave auctions? NO, they are a corpse son. Thank You Pres Trump

599 2018-05-28 22:42:35 I just chewed up a piece of clove that was being kept for a year in cannabis-infused oil.

626 2018-05-28 22:38:34 Okay get this, sounds weird but it works: yet some Detol on an ear bud and cover it in that and then if you have some tea tree oil (can get some from body shop. Works WONDERS) use that after. It. Works!!

628 2018-05-28 22:38:20 Surprised that no one seems to have picked up on the "windfall fund" (oil revenues, licensing new blocs etc) purpose of building infrastructure to help future generations. That releases current infrastructure spending for other purposes.

635 2018-05-28 22:37:29 Yea, that is true Leftypickit. But they are not running half of Syria and Iraq and no longer running their own state, with Oil income to start as much trouble. And that is thanks to DJT. So on this Memorial Day, Thank You Donald J Trump for killing ISIS.
636 2018-05-28 22:37:26 Grease to operate. They also leak this oil on to the ground. The best way to clean the air. Plant more trees. A single mature trees consums 48 lbs of CO2 a yr. An acre of new trees consume 2.5 million lbs of CO2 a yr. Imagine what 100 acres of new trees would do.

654 2018-05-28 22:34:39 So I guess that now the barrel price for oil has fallen dramatically that this will be immediately reflected at the bowsers.

697 2018-05-28 22:27:58 Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises. Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.

701 2018-05-28 22:27:44 I'm going to preface my message with a solid "I don't know for sure" however it could be the product, your skin being too dry (maybe), if you have oily skin maybe the pomade is keeping the oil in and it's ruining the follicles or something or your makeup wipes may be too rough

But we can only fund 20% of the budget!

Are we no longer selling CRUDE Oil?
What of other sources of revenue?

The stupidity of Change defined.

725 2018-05-28 22:25:09 Have U tried tea tree oil? Or witch hazel?
726 2018-05-28 22:24:58 Not after embezzling all the money that belong to the entire nation. God/Allah will never condone decievers and liers. While you own some oil blocks and have embezzled billions of naira in the past, atleast 60% of children in your region are begging for food on the street.
727 2018-05-28 22:24:58 OPEC and allied oil producers including Russia concluded that their output cuts achieved a key goal of eliminating the global surplus. Simply Put Oil Price will stay at elevated levels. Grrrr!
728 2018-05-28 22:24:54 Weak foreign policy-Pakistan is going to black list in June and world bank kick Pakistan ass on Pakistan IWT issue.
Strong policy-America giving waiver on sanctions to India in defense deal with Russia and purchasing oil from Iran and china declare Hafiz Sayed terrorist in brics.

730 2018-05-28 22:24:52 One of the guys that changed my oil put their grubby ass hands on my pink seats when they vacuumed and I am angry
731 2018-05-28 22:24:51 "Oil? on the couch?"
In that moment, I knew my life was forfeit.
732 2018-05-28 22:24:45 Turkey really needs affordable electric cars more than any other country. We have no natural resources and oil prices are killing our economy.
733 2018-05-28 22:24:41 Went to Trader Joe’s yesterday for the first time and bought coconut oil cooking spray and Marcus goes “I don’t care how hippy you get, you just have to shave your armpits”

736 2018-05-28 22:24:04 Absolutely right. This avalanche of BS from this “technicians”. They were wrong all they way thru the oil rally from mid 30’s Now that start again with more Sh..Monday Morning QuarterBacks. They’re full of it
737 2018-05-28 22:23:40 With the way some girls love men with cars,  You will think they were breastfeed with Engine oil
738 2018-05-28 22:23:30 From this thread, it seems like this didn't work out so well for you Frank. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else you hypocrite. Maybe you should helo look for the children don't and his Gestapo lost when they were separated from their parents at the borderm Not very christian.
739 2018-05-28 22:23:29 Let's see if this coconut castor oil will do any thing for my hair
740 2018-05-28 22:23:04 Might be the oil
741 2018-05-28 22:23:00 Data's dead - oil's back baby.
742 2018-05-28 22:22:58 I don't do custard bases, but I think you're bang-on about the zest. Or bumping it up with some extra lemon oil some other way.
743 2018-05-28 22:22:55 The Texas billionaires and federal government making the money—from a project which just had another spill—is not going to be putting it towards green energy. Their agenda is to make money, while exploiting the earth and the oil it gives until it runs out.
744 2018-05-28 22:22:44 I got big pores and oily skin so coconut oil is a no from me. I’m trying to figure out stuff I can use to clean my face 
745 2018-05-28 22:22:15 Marinade the meat in olive oil + lemon juice + garlic + onions and seasoning of course
746 2018-05-28 22:22:14 I know a few.
747 2018-05-28 22:22:12 Peace talks with NK. Booming economy. Oil industry booming. Embassy moved to Jerusalem where it belongs , deregulation , putting America 1st
748 2018-05-28 22:22:07 Stafford intends to focus its initial operations on the exploration drilling of
Raptor's Provost Alberta property, which if successful, will be followed by the
acquisition of an interest in the development and exploration of the Norris Oil
Field.

752 2018-05-28 22:21:35 Whenever I get my car serviced, they give me a free car wash coupon and a free two month subscription to Sirius XM. And people tell me not to go the dealer for an oil change. Lol.
753 2018-05-28 22:21:35 a. I have no idea who you’re talking about - and I don’t control who other people block

b. Why is that in any way relevant to Donny/Knight having hilariously infantile opinions?

c. Extra funny considering your Oil Knight fellow blocked me after losing an argument!
754 2018-05-28 22:21:29 They are creating machines to clean the plastic and junk,  drugs too like you just said with the poor oysters..... They dump oil and run off from coal mines and everything into the water.
755 2018-05-28 22:21:24 Also I’m probably one of the only girls I know that knows how to check my oil, and check my coolant in my car. My mom and my big sister don’t  even know what coolant is
756 2018-05-28 22:21:21 nah, it shows us being grown up. Scotland is where it is. The oil has been pissed up a london back street. And socialism does not work anywhere. Scandinavia is not socialist. Business pays for their welfare state. A thriving Scotland will do the same.
757 2018-05-28 22:21:09 The prospect is an extension of oil discovered in an offsetting section
of land in the lower Cretaceous Cummings and Ellerslie zones. Seismic readings
indicate that structurally the pool in which the oil lies is some 13 to 16 feet
higher on the property Raptor has under lease.
758 2018-05-28 22:20:55 Given the increase in gas prices due to your moronic middle east policies, that .50 per hour increase the average American received from your stupid tax cuts has now been transferred to the oil companies & oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia & Russia.  Good move genius.
759 2018-05-28 22:20:54 There was lack of any powerful insight on the part of GOP voters. They bought the snake oil.
760 2018-05-28 22:20:52 The slight difference in the
geological structure should result in the Cummings zone being on the crest of
the structure and the Ellerslie zone having up to 39 feet of recoverable oil
versus the 16 feet realized in the offsetting section of land.
761 2018-05-28 22:20:51 Being Natural Not That Bad . It’s Good Taking A Break From Weave To Wash , Condition , And Oil Your Hair And Just Let It Dry To It’s Natural Curl Pattern  No Heat On My Hair All Summer , Sticking To Braids And My Hair I Dont Need That Weave Shit .

764 2018-05-28 22:20:35 THE KEY= ROYALTIES- Stafford has identified two prospective oil and gas properties located in
Alberta Canada with the potential to provide a significant return on investment
to the company.

774 2018-05-28 22:20:02 Further,
certain directors are officers or directors of Raptor Capital Corporation
("Raptor"), a public oil and gas company that trades on the Canadian Venture
Exchange under the symbol CA: RCP, with whom Stafford has entered into an
exploration drilling participation agreement.
775 2018-05-28 22:19:57 Yes, slightly.
776 2018-05-28 22:19:57 All replicants need their oil changed every 100,000 miles
777 2018-05-28 22:19:42 Stafford's strategy is to acquire, develop and produce proven reserves of oil
and gas with limited upfront acquisition costs in partnership with established
small independent producers on properties that can be developed to production
quickly.
778 2018-05-28 22:19:36 Scotland, the last colony making money for little England, can't let them Damn jocks think they can rule themselves, then we'd have to pay for our oil and our drinking water, bloody ingrates.
779 2018-05-28 22:19:24 Time to cut subsidies to oil companies!
780 2018-05-28 22:19:20 Oil prices are falling fast. Here's why - CNN Moneyhttps://apple.news/At6b9FaoRTeCfRlPjwnGHNw

795 2018-05-28 22:15:53 Just cube them all up and add them to anything and everything. Making chicken? Sauté them in the pan with it. roasted potatoes? Toss them in oil and put them on the tray for the oven. Rice? Sauté them first, add the rice, then the liquid & cook. Sooooo easy
796 2018-05-28 22:15:44 We always have higher gas prices in Whatcom County. We also have 2 oil refineries so it seems odd that our gas costs more.
797 2018-05-28 22:15:17 #PBR  down over 9% in Sao Paulo after Brazil's government offered new fuel subsidies and changed the oil producer’s pricing policy.
798 2018-05-28 22:14:47 I felt virtuous abt buying “green” non-petroleum lighter fluid until I opened the bottle & gagged at the nostril-tingling stench of old dry oil in which I believe a mammal decayed.

But it’s all I had, so the grill is lit & the neighbors’ opinion of me is .

800 2018-05-28 22:14:30 I am glad to hear that we are not neglected. :)

@vekilince talked about how Maduro used oil rents and did not create opportunities for production in other sectors. However, his analogy between the two presidents is on their method of managing foreign relations: mostly fighting.
801 2018-05-28 22:14:24 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they eat them out
802 2018-05-28 22:13:52 Why do food establishments feel the need to add truffle to everything? Truffle oil, truffle mayo, truffle whatever I'm allergic and I know it ain't changing taste that much 
803 2018-05-28 22:13:45 Allah has guided Ontario voters back to senses and it appears that people of Ontario will reject hatred and #islamophobia in Doug "little Trump" Ford. Great news. #onpoli
804 2018-05-28 22:13:33 You say that as if Cadbury’s are concerned about taste anymore. Have you seen a tin of roses lately? They’re all the same flavour! And that flavour is Palm Oil.
805 2018-05-28 22:13:31 This oil so runny even when you don’t put a lot .

811 2018-05-28 22:12:49 I’ve used cbd oil for my chronic pain and I didn’t have to take my narcotics but because California is so ignorant we can’t buy it here so I am forced to take muscle relaxers pain medication sleeping pills it’s very sad!

818 2018-05-28 22:11:34 Cbd oil is supposed to be pretty great stuff!
819 2018-05-28 22:11:26 Which oil?
820 2018-05-28 22:11:17 When you go to a professional to scan it you get in this format. If you've ever had an image where small and you make it big then it gets blurry.Putting it into a tiff format almost makes it impossible it to get blurry. You could make a huge poster even if its a small drawing. :)
821 2018-05-28 22:11:13 3 but anywhere in the 1-8 is workable. Last row is going to burn out my blender with his protein smoothies and use up all my coconut oil and nads wax strips.

825 2018-05-28 22:10:44 Will it work ok with my internet diet pills of course I dunno what’s in them but can you take VPN with random snake oil drugs off the internet? Just checking is VPN like AIDS ?
826 2018-05-28 22:10:42 One thing to try, my friend has had 6 back surgeries for degenerative disk disease. He uses a salve that has CBD oil in it. He says it doesn't take away the pain, but it helps.  Maybe that's an option for you.
827 2018-05-28 22:10:37 yeah no I totally agree. medications never help for long and getting on and off medications all the the time is so hard. personally CBD oil is the only legal medication that helps with preventing it so I’m just patiently waiting for Indiana to become a green state haha
828 2018-05-28 22:10:36 Strawberry Miyoki been watching nailed it so i let her make them but we forgot the oil

835 2018-05-28 22:09:57 st John's wort is a supplement and chamomile is tea but lavender essential oil helps me
836 2018-05-28 22:09:53 @realDonaldTrump with the U.S. EXPORTING oil, WHY are you allowing gas prices to hit $3/gallon? The economy is doing well but this hurts the people you say you want to help!

The dude was reaching around it to hold his arm but wasn't willing to risk climbing around to pull him up himself.
852 2018-05-28 22:07:34 Let's be clear here: At no point am I or have I suggested pipelines are A Good Thing. All I've stated is that thinking rail is better is at best debatable and at worst a false dichotomy, since the ideal way to transport oil is not to do it at all.
853 2018-05-28 22:07:32 I just paid 4.00 a gallon for gas! Highway robbery. Stop selling our oil Trump. Why do we have to buy foreign oil for 2x the price while you sell our oil to England?
854 2018-05-28 22:07:17 That's silly. Cars leak very little oil these days, and the gradual phase out of gasoline/diesel cars and trucks will solve that problem over a period of years.

859 2018-05-28 22:06:53 It's been the primary struggle throughout my life, and the catalyst for so much intrapersonal negativity. Each day managing it varies in difficulty, but it is always there, no matter what. 

It's one of the reasons I've lately become so interested in CBD oil for anxiety.
860 2018-05-28 22:06:43 Stretch marks? Spot break out? Scars? Dry skin? Dry hair? Cooking? Coconut oil. Literally.
861 2018-05-28 22:06:42 I drank castor oil and went into labor the same day  I walked a couple blocks to my friends house drank the castor oil with cranberry juice and walked back home and I was in labor no more than 20 mins later 
862 2018-05-28 22:06:13 Me!Me!Me! is amazing. Wish I'd watched it on a bigger screen (so I could sit farther back) and with the benefit of cannabis oil but... still worth it. Freaky at some points, but worth it.
863 2018-05-28 22:06:11 Don't forget that oil is shipped in trains across BC too.  And grain needs to move.  Pipeline = safer oil transportation, more room for grain.  Economy goes on.  There is no valid reason I can think of to stop the pipeline except environmental extremism.
864 2018-05-28 22:06:10 Can’t wait until I can afford microblading, I’m tired of waiting on these brow serums and castor oil.

877 2018-05-28 22:04:42 So in spirit of Memorial Day, I wanna just add my 2 cents in and advocate for policies that do not send our soldiers to die for a lie.  If our soldiers need to give their lives, then they should not be doing it for oil or for unnecessary regime change.

935 2018-05-28 21:55:35 The rise in gas price was intentional.  Russia’s economy relies on the price of oil and gas.  *45 backing out of the Iranian obligation drove the price of oil up, which gives putin more money to operate globally and commit his crimes against America .

970 2018-05-28 21:48:03 Or even better. A free market in money. A weak dollar = higher oil prices.
971 2018-05-28 21:48:00 “All those IG hoes you see that’s on their way to Dubai via first class, they’re 99% gonna get drilled by some oil rich guy.” Man... women really doing the damn thing.. nothing but props man
972 2018-05-28 21:47:54 @VassyKapelos I’m American so I have no dog in the show but Mrs May is inaccurate and isn’t KM a private company why dose she need evidence that a company needs contracts to sell oil it up to share holders if they want to tolerate that expenditure
973 2018-05-28 21:47:51 Ok girl get you some tea tree oil stat & another that area.
974 2018-05-28 21:47:19 Oil will not be released publically until they create some story to show how was at right and at risk!
975 2018-05-28 21:47:10 I hear olive oil does wonders for hair but I’ve never tried it myself
976 2018-05-28 21:47:08 Just let nature have it back.We don't need to drive there.
977 2018-05-28 21:47:05 I’m going to make you even madder: I do like white pizza but w olive oil, garlic, spinach, broccoli and tomato slices
978 2018-05-28 21:46:51 Xhaka may not have been a big name but he was a relatively big money signing.  I hope the club find a nice middle ground of spending big while, also finding those diamonds in the rough/developing some of the young guns.  I dont want the club to buy trophies with oil money.
979 2018-05-28 21:46:49 I hate fresh oil AND chips
980 2018-05-28 21:46:48 Because he fed you lip service while lying to everyone when he never had any intention of doing either snake oil salesmen
981 2018-05-28 21:46:44 Tengo miedo de que por culpa de las ilusiones termine lastimada como siempre
982 2018-05-28 21:46:13 We'd have a central bank with our own currency. You know banks. Then of course there is the oil revenues..oh & gas, water, wind & solar..I could go on. Don't start with the too wee, too poor..
983 2018-05-28 21:46:06 @RBoslego Hi. I have seen your services advertised on seeking alpha. There is no contact email. I am a beginer crude oil futures trader. Would your services be suitable for oil futures traders?
984 2018-05-28 21:45:59 The bio oil...it does nothing!

994 2018-05-28 21:44:59 You answered your own question: if he keeps US oil here to lower prices his big oil buddies who want mo' money will cut off campaign funds.
995 2018-05-28 21:44:56 It's been £45 BILLION for some time? That excludes oil and gas fluffy. Yes?
996 2018-05-28 21:44:51 琴歌嬢を尊べ
997 2018-05-28 21:44:44 Too many military members have died, NOT protecting our freedoms, but rather protecting our access to cheap oil, cheap labor including slavery, and cheap consumer goods and markets.   So many need not have sacrificed so much for materialistic values and corporate profits.
998 2018-05-28 21:44:30 Lmaooooo that Okpa is just struggle moimoi dipped in palm oil and dry as fuck.
999 2018-05-28 21:44:24 @indtravel @BorneoWP @OrangutanFndn time to stop chopping your forests down and using palm oil... you'll regret it very soon if you don't now!
1000 2018-05-28 21:44:15 Tell the rich Texans we don't want their dirty oil, their strong-arm tactics, or their blatant propaganda.
We especially don't want to be on the hook for 100's of millions of dollars when the whole project implodes.
Shannon, you're out of your depth with your pro-oil cheering.
1001 2018-05-28 21:44:14 I remember a few pals and I getting all hyped for Fosters in ‘95ish because of their sweet commercials. Turns out it tastes like the oil can it comes in. I’ll happily tip those Pbers though.
1002 2018-05-28 21:44:13 Who forget the oil in my cupcakes i hate when i be thinking about other shit while cooking.
1003 2018-05-28 21:44:12 Get a hot tools straightner  Also use heat protector spray always and do a leave in conditioner before hand. I use the argan oil by ogx it's a leave in oil only spray a little
1004 2018-05-28 21:44:08 Then again farmers could use a rail system upgraded with profits from oil. Pipelines don’t transport people or non petroleum cargoes and are useless to farmers.
1005 2018-05-28 21:44:04 The skin that tea tree and peppermint oil on a paper towel to the face brings is worth the tears
1006 2018-05-28 21:44:03 Reminds me of watching Iain Gray the other day in Holyrood saying, “we’ve been told the government intend to set up an oil fund but they’ve not said where the money is coming from”
1007 2018-05-28 21:43:38 4 years ago Saudis cranked production, crashed oil prices 50% in 6 months. Now they cut production, raising price 50%  half as fast as they drooped it (over a year), perhaps back to $100. Perfect market control, they drove out/bought out competition. Caprices of power.
1008 2018-05-28 21:43:35 Honestly the natural hair community is so bandwagon. one person says this is bad for you and y’all cancel it instead of doing personal research  Everyone hair is different cause y’all was on that coconut oil bandwagon til some of y’all hair started to break off
1009 2018-05-28 21:43:32 What act (specifically), did he take that necessitated treason?
1010 2018-05-28 21:43:28 With my head full of fridge magnets and engine oil, do you mind if the smell doesn't go away?
1011 2018-05-28 21:43:19 You would sooner buy another pair of glasses than get your oil changed.
1012 2018-05-28 21:42:56 The best way to honour fallen soldiers of American wars is to stop Republicans from starting new wars for money, oil, greed or finish daddy's unfinished business. Diplomacy & communication should be our first lines of defense, not Black and Brown bodies dying on the battle field.
1013 2018-05-28 21:42:44 Your so right Nancy.....since 1971 we need to remember the coragious men and women that fought and died for the preservation of the dollar for oil #PetroDollarSystem
1014 2018-05-28 21:42:42 Huge explosions are definitely exceedigly rare (and even rarer with pipelines as the data shows) but TSB tracks hundreds of incidents a year involving injuries on and around oil rail lines.
1015 2018-05-28 21:42:24 SO @RachelNotley Why are we expected to accept promises from oil companies and shipping co.s when they don't honour without courts? @JustinTrudeau can't expect us to go along when the fund set up for such spills won't pay up but 27%of cost. HE says trust us.  NO @JustinTrudeau
1016 2018-05-28 21:42:21 3 dollars plus for gas because Trump promised Big Oil he’d make sure they made HUGE profits for campaign contributions. Just like for 30 million from NRA he promised to do nothing about school children getting killed almost weekly
1017 2018-05-28 21:42:10 Need an oil change like 3,527 miles ago 
1018 2018-05-28 21:42:10 I find it very strange that Chiarelli is actively involved with the Oil Kings like this. Isn't this a conflict of interest?> I know the Oilers own the Oil Kings but thought there was supposed to be some sort of separation between the two.
1019 2018-05-28 21:42:05 Why are you bringing up 1999.he is trying to compare Jonathan era nd these present era. upon the high sale of crude in Jonathan area only $27b in our reserve acct. now our acct presently is almost hitting $50b with fall in crude oil prices nd low production .
1020 2018-05-28 21:42:00 yup. nye did as well of a job that he could w/ the tools he had available to him, which compared to a scientist..well like you said. knowledge.  Ham is just a idiotic snake oil sales man, its unfortunate that the city he bankrupted got caught in it.. but stupid is as stupid does.
1021 2018-05-28 21:41:57 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1022 2018-05-28 21:41:57 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1023 2018-05-28 21:41:41 I am interested in what people believe the benefits are for cannabis/oil etc. The one that’s abused the most is anxiety relief, which it definitely does not have. Cancer prevention is also a big nope. What is true and what is not?
1024 2018-05-28 21:41:40 Cool, let's drill our own oil then!  Problem solved
1025 2018-05-28 21:41:36 New problem with the car, cracked oil pan... $750 or so to fix that 
1026 2018-05-28 21:41:20 ah, this is good to know! this is my first cast iron pan so i just keep googling stuff to make sure i'm doing it right!  what kind of oil do you use, or do you use shortening?
1027 2018-05-28 21:41:01 I moved a large oil & gas co HQ for Europe, Africa & Russia from Edinburgh to Heathrow 10 yrs ago. North Sea not worth it any longer. Who looks silly now?
1028 2018-05-28 21:40:56 I don’t think it’s a specific hardship it’s all the additional taxes ,the MSP tax on employers, the carbon tax addition , and the fact that the provincial government is fighting a fight on oil that would raise billions of dollars . That’s what people are steamed about.
1029 2018-05-28 21:40:49 Makondofia~ are the new oil ati sijui digital nini nini...lol!

1033 2018-05-28 21:40:15 Where would any of us be without oil? A key component to the evolution of technology via the combustion engine. Dark times await us. How do you feel about that?
1034 2018-05-28 21:40:13 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1035 2018-05-28 21:40:02 I think it's safe to say the "no personal stuff" ship sailed with his coconut oil blog.
1036 2018-05-28 21:39:43 Haha’ Israel has no gold and oil.. smh. Maybe ppl get high there like the rest of the world who has that same problem

1040 2018-05-28 21:38:57 The freedom for western oil companies to rape the middle east for its oil reserves!
1041 2018-05-28 21:38:57 I met a WW2 vet a few years back while getting my cars oil changed. I was mindlessly reading a book on Japanese Kanji when an elderly man and his daughter walked in. he was wearing "WW2 veteran" hat...
1042 2018-05-28 21:38:50 My nickname growing up was kerosene, my grandma would say red oil and groundnut oil dey sleep but kerosene no dey sleep, naps felt like punishment for me
1043 2018-05-28 21:38:47 Omggggg, now I’m more scared. I was thinking of putting coconut oil 
1044 2018-05-28 21:38:45 So many oil lobbyists on your show in the last few weeks. They sure want billions for that failed #abpoli toxic white elephant. #pnpcbc

1046 2018-05-28 21:38:20 Coconut oil is the devil to my hair. I have very low porosity hair so that just sits on top of it

1052 2018-05-28 21:36:17 Sir why u r not talking about fuel price and daily commodity prices are very high compare to crude oil prices
1053 2018-05-28 21:36:13 Me to waitress: what’s EVOO *pronounces it eeeevooooo*
Waitress: extra virgin olive oil 
Ohhhh
1054 2018-05-28 21:36:09 I have to ask!!!! Why is gas so high again? I thought we had plenty of oil. When gas prices went down, groceries didn't. Didn't understand that either.
1055 2018-05-28 21:36:03 i have coconut oil in my room and its been so hot today that it has turned into liquid
1056 2018-05-28 21:35:57 Now do BP oil spill.

Her goth phase.
1057 2018-05-28 21:35:46 The guy next to me smells like oil. Like so you wash your clothes in oil or....?? It hurts my nose.
1058 2018-05-28 21:35:45 I was agreeing with you.  I do season them and sometimes put milk in them. Oil the pan wit olive oil and go to work.

1062 2018-05-28 21:35:20 Adding more whale oil to the pouring hole, Lenin, an excellent mind reader, shouts "Edison is racist!"
1063 2018-05-28 21:34:51 Get urself quench cream and xylocain gel mix them and apply 3 times a day 
It can cause discolouration so when u apply clean it with paraffin oil so it doesn’t leave any discolouration
1064 2018-05-28 21:34:49 "Man, why don't people just buy a shit ton of oil, its gonna be worth something eventually"

~it costs money to warehouse things you diiiiiiiiiiiip~
1065 2018-05-28 21:34:44 Badass? Really? She is an irrelevant criminal hypocrite. I will begin to consider arguments from your ilk, ONLY when you all stop buying/using ALL products derived from oil.  You can't and you know it !!
1066 2018-05-28 21:34:38 Defending liberty and freedom in other countrys who dont want your help and have at random oil en masse.
1067 2018-05-28 21:34:38 Win Nov canola down A$2.31/t & EU rape down A$2.05 in thin trade with US mkts closed. Scattered storms delivered rain across Canada but results patchy. Weaker crude oil but some support from weaker C$ vs US$.
1068 2018-05-28 21:34:25 You know I’m telling the truth . Too much coconut oil has a certain stench and it’s nasty
1069 2018-05-28 21:34:23 I'm glaswegian stupid, but I'm also British, unlike your snp punter. Scottish oil, jeezo, you still believe that myth that the oil was all ours.
1070 2018-05-28 21:34:17 If you reject this pipeline then you shouldn’t be buying foreign oil!

1073 2018-05-28 21:33:46 I didn't have the balls to do anything to my hair in high school. I wish I'd taken a chance, because I always end up black now. I had really long hair, it would have looked good black. Recently I took my hair from black to white, and my hair isn't fried! The secret is coconut oil
1074 2018-05-28 21:33:41 Too good to be true? Have you seen the gas prices? There goes the little change we get on payday. Snake Oil for the slippery slide
1075 2018-05-28 21:33:36 No, it’s an old Victorian trunk. I’ve cleaned,sanded it down and waxed it to get the 100 plus years of oil and grime off it but it still seems to splinter?
1076 2018-05-28 21:33:32 Oh damn babe.... not sure if I should spank it, eat it for oil it up and fuck it 
1077 2018-05-28 21:33:19 Coconut oil 
1078 2018-05-28 21:33:15 But wait there is more. American consumer/public deserve a review of concessions to “big oil” as to whether they foster energy independence to eliminate America support of despot regimes.(Like Saudi Arabia, etc.) I have many more deserving things, and none are in ranked order.
1079 2018-05-28 21:33:03 Note to myself: The oil in the fryer is HOT, keep it away from your face. (Don't even ask how I did it)
1080 2018-05-28 21:32:59 Just wait till a loaded rail car hits the Fraser River . The oil is coming to the coast either way .
1081 2018-05-28 21:32:44 Deepest fear is getting popped by oil while frying fish
1082 2018-05-28 21:32:31 I think this is terrible advice especially regarding women’s, LGBTQ, civil rights, gun reform, $in politics, corruption in govt, big banks, big oil, big pharma, health insurance industry, the gun lobby, environmental protections and climate change, geo engineering...

1085 2018-05-28 21:32:19 See the way I usually really like it is unhealthy hdjdbdbdb I usually season it then bread it and fry it it’s really good. Cucumbers are amazing!!! I either mix it with onions and tomato’s and just put a lil oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and eat it like that
1086 2018-05-28 21:32:08 Of course I found you, you added me straight away. I'd steer clear of the mushrooms
1087 2018-05-28 21:32:08 @BraincageGaming to answer your ? earlier. Any pizza dough recipe will work. All recipes are basically the same. Flour, water, oil, yeast, salt and sugar. The ratios don't much matter. Its what you do with it afterwards that makes the difference.
1088 2018-05-28 21:32:06 They do want to increase taxes. On Trump’s butt-buddies the ultra rich CEOs, oil company execs, pharma heads - you know the 1% that have all the wealth. He is helping those poor souls make ends meet, but the Dems have no such problem collecting from those who have it all.
1089 2018-05-28 21:31:33 Lewl with all these answers but try a deodorant on your legs and inside the skirt/ dress. It stops from riding and blowing up for me 
Deodorant and cream works better than w/ oil
I hope helps for you x

1099 2018-05-28 21:29:06 ...You want the coal industry to be replaced. You want the water to be safe. You want the oil pipelines to stop. You want incentives for people that use solar energy. You can share this tweet.

1107 2018-05-28 21:28:15 This country went to shit in 2001. September 11th to be exact. When the oil mongers decided that a severe attack on the homeland would be a great precursor to endless war. That the US would have control of all of the worlds oil.

But she forget that at time 
1. we import virtually every thing 
2.our oil production drop by 1/2
3. The price of the oil itself drop by 2/3
Therefore floating Naira

1156 2018-05-28 21:19:32 Was there oil or grease, even a trace amount, on the beaters or in the bowl? My recollection is that that will stop cream from whipping.

1167 2018-05-28 21:17:54 Haha. I actually have a cheap airfryer, and it's useful if you're on a diet because you dont have to use oil to cook something. Plus, you can portion things out better. It's no substitute for real cooking, but its nice. 
1168 2018-05-28 21:17:39 Lets not forget that Trump has done more to hurt the Russians than Obama did (FYI, Why didn't OB admin say anything about Russians and the elections before it started). Trump Killed 200 Russians and increase OUR oil production, which hurts them more than anything else.
1169 2018-05-28 21:17:35 Why release when money isn't in the game itself?  Business tends to turn towards the oil well and CIG found that in selling concepts. There is simply zero incentive to sell or complete a game anymore. They'll all ensure they live their desired lifestyles then put rest in the game

1203 2018-05-28 21:10:32 1) They were actually TRYING previously to get a backwardated market, i.e. bring passive long managed $ on front end attracted by roll yield. But I think now the strategy is to maintain a steady and stable mkt. Iran oil is coming off the mkt already tho sanctions hit fully in X.

1234 2018-05-28 21:06:08 Quite impressed that someone’s racism could extend to believing that a pan of oil could only conceivably start a fire if it was being used to fry mysterious, foreign, inherently dangerous “‘local’ food from home”.

1239 2018-05-28 21:05:24 Probably not as bad as palm oil.

Rapeseed is basically bog standard “vegetable” oil though isn’t it?

1243 2018-05-28 21:04:44 I wonder what they are gonna do about the concentrates like was, hash, oil, shatter, etc that can be over 90%
1244 2018-05-28 21:04:40 But this one is more about the objectively oily nature of the oil bottle
1245 2018-05-28 21:04:36 Can you imagine writing a blog, coming to the conclusion that Scotland won't even be as well off as Denmark (which has virtually no oil) after 67 years. And not being bright enough to conclude it might be because you're part of the UK. 
1246 2018-05-28 21:04:35 It you have wraps you can cut into triangles and roast them with some olive oil or it goes great on toast
1247 2018-05-28 21:04:35 I mean, just ask Iraq! They're loving their liberation so much! And Libya! It's just a great big barbecue party over there for ages now.
We are so generous that we even liberated Iraqi oil!
1248 2018-05-28 21:04:22 someone used oil in the San Antonio Area wanna let me use their pool or their neighborhood pool cards
1249 2018-05-28 21:04:20 "I GOT THAT OIL" 

AND you van always tell who don't.
1250 2018-05-28 21:04:04 REMEMBER WHITE PPL

1251 2018-05-28 21:03:57 are you trying to lift Trump up by pulling Musk down using a stupid-man's analogy or are you just a stupid man? quitting crack because its running out's sound logic & continuing to smoke it because there's plenty is not. we are hooked on oil like a crack addict's hooked on crack.
1252 2018-05-28 21:03:53 Love burning the shit out of my face with hot ass oil 
1253 2018-05-28 21:03:43 40 billion barrels of oil we've sold. 40 billion. And we're still 67 years behind our peers?

And this is supposed to convince me to stick with the UK? 
1254 2018-05-28 21:03:43 2/ I did not have problem getting a BMW i3 in San Antonio, but the Chevy dealers I visited either knew nothing about their EVs, or couldn't find one to let me test drive. My BMW salesman claimed that was because the owners of the Chevy dealerships had close ties to oil industry.
1255 2018-05-28 21:03:29 Watch? No oil? Venezuela ring a bell?
1256 2018-05-28 21:03:22 I usually make my own carrot oil, coconut oil and rose oil from scratch 
1257 2018-05-28 21:03:19 Not sure about the oil change. Most cars have the filter where it can't be reached without a jack or ramp or lift. Maybe checking the oil is a must instead. You are still 100% on.
1258 2018-05-28 21:03:18 Do u think CBD oil from Hemp is better than CBD oil from Cannibas Flowers?? 
I live in Colorado so I can get either one...but which is better?
1259 2018-05-28 21:03:17 Fake-45's stats are incorrect. Note:  plastics are no longer recyclable. China won't take our recycled plastics. We're over our heads in trash, starting with oil corporations and Fake-45. Get to work on that, foo..And SHOW US YOUR TAX RETURNS!

1264 2018-05-28 21:02:51 FINALMENTE L'HAI TROVATO SU GOOGLE!!!Peccato non sia corretto perchè non tiene conto della vetustà degli impianti e della scarsa qualità dell'oil che richiede raffinazione più costosa.Ora sparisci IDIOTA!
1265 2018-05-28 21:02:39 Caribou numbers in NEBC are actually on the rise.
And their decline is not due to the oil and gas industry. Wolves and poaching are the reason. 
Perhaps if ypu would stop whining evert me we had a wolf clue up here the Caribou would make even more of a comeback.
1266 2018-05-28 21:02:38 bet we can cover it in 10 gallons of baby oil as long as it does sumn lmao
1267 2018-05-28 21:02:30 they must use whale oil for their lamps

1270 2018-05-28 21:02:02 The price of crude oil is currently $80 a barrel.
Quietly.
@APCNigeria @MBuhari @AsoRock you guys are quiet now.

2018's budget was bench market at around $65 so next year when you're asked what happened to the excess, you will not be stammering.
1271 2018-05-28 21:01:59 I bought another one... Even worst  we are facing a friend crisis right now, even you heard about? The truck drivers are under strike, they doesn't work anymore and Brasil stopped to sell foods, oil and some products :D
1272 2018-05-28 21:01:58 Some may go missing but trust me they got lost in the oil.

1280 2018-05-28 21:01:26 You can tell a blind man that there is not enough oil in the soup, but you cannot tell him that there is not enough salt or pepper in that soup. If there are achievements, we would have seen them.
1281 2018-05-28 21:01:20 @KellyannePolls Can you ask @POTUS to open the strategic oil reserve, it will help all Americans struggling at the pump and put billions in the Treasury as the oil was bought cheap and needs to be refreshed anyways. #openthereserve
1282 2018-05-28 21:01:19 Modern American warfare is immoral and oppressive and thousands of soldiers have died for little more than oil and heroine. Happy memorial day, don't let their deaths be for nothing #EndTheFed
1283 2018-05-28 21:01:11 Do you think it's the actual changes or is it perception that also leads to this? I feel like... a lot of people said Rashid is dead the second they saw the changes, but after watching Oil King at CB, I have to wonder if people who abandoned ship overreacted a little.
1284 2018-05-28 21:01:07 None of the photos above have nuts except for the tofu dish and you can just sub out the oil for that recipe to make it nut free  the link has info on everything in the ebook.

1294 2018-05-28 20:59:46 Exactly. Come on.
1295 2018-05-28 20:59:45 Sweet almond oil is my favorite!
1296 2018-05-28 20:59:34 I'm also using this coconut oil
1297 2018-05-28 20:59:17 I have to say that I’m also quite bothered about his description of Keith Val - “oil slick”??? FFS!
1298 2018-05-28 20:59:16 Notice the date. Oh nothing to say now. Yeah I know. Oh and since you know so much about the oil industry I shouldn’t have to explain to you that every summer the gas prices rise a bit and every winter they go back down a bit.
1299 2018-05-28 20:58:57 BOTH sides work with deep state military industrial. In the end the deals are about oil. It's all greed and corruption. That's why we need the progressive wave that refuses to be corrupted.
1300 2018-05-28 20:58:52 I just tried this coconut oil one that isn’t... it’s more smooth and thin.. and it last longer.
1301 2018-05-28 20:58:17 Spilling coconut oil over my bed is just what I want to do as I get into bed 
1302 2018-05-28 20:58:17 Idk if i need the baby oil or the baby with the oil either way its gas
1303 2018-05-28 20:58:05 Damn $5/acre doesn't seem like much. Can anyone bid on these? Like, could an enviro group bid on them to block any oil and gas leasing?
1304 2018-05-28 20:57:39 Baby oil. Leave on to soak for half an hour and then have a shower and use an exfoliating sponge if you have 1

1306 2018-05-28 20:57:24 @friendscallmeap yes would love an oil update!
1307 2018-05-28 20:57:11 WTF, how much oil does Iran produce? Not much
1308 2018-05-28 20:57:04 Framing CBD oil as a panacea is incredibly dangerous, I agree. It does have proven benefits, however. So it shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.
1309 2018-05-28 20:56:59 I have and I love it, I like the one with a little honey a lot. I like hydrogenated oil peanut butters. I like all sorts. But I really truly am telling you this was incredible, best. I am sure rapeseed oil is bad in an environmental way now that you say it. Shame.
1310 2018-05-28 20:56:29 IKR! Also, it does not taste any good, their fried chicken tastes like burnt oil! I don't understand why would someone want to eat something so unhealthy that tastes disgusting too!
1311 2018-05-28 20:56:28 Tiny asian Kia gets her pussy stuffed with willingness to pump more oil into global markets

1313 2018-05-28 20:56:00 Also be careful how much tea tree oil you’re using.  It can be overly drying.  It used to be my go-to when I had very bad acne.  But since I only have it along my jaw, I don’t use it anymore unless I have a breakout 
1314 2018-05-28 20:55:57 The stadium is a mess. And I heard Pharcourt has oil. Disgrace

1317 2018-05-28 20:55:32 Me bad I thought it was snake oil. Thanks for the clarification.
1318 2018-05-28 20:55:20 Not the poor oil workers again. It’s terrible they might have to downsize from a 6 bedroom house and 3 range rovers and 3 holidays a year to maybe a 4 bedroom, 2 land rovers and only 2 holidays now.
1319 2018-05-28 20:55:09 Too bad PM Stephen Harper couldn't have followed up on setting our 30% by 2030 target, by actually going to negotiate the #ParisAgreement .
Oh right; he got booted out of office, after 8 yrs of promising GHG regs for oil & gas but never delivering.
1320 2018-05-28 20:55:08 Rapeseed oil though!
Do you have thoughts on Peanut Butter & Co? It’s just peanuts and salt. And it makes the best bloody peanut butter cookies you will ever eat. 

Unless you prefer your peanut butter cookies to be dry, in which case you will not agree with this sentiment

1327 2018-05-28 20:54:24 It's meant to drive up oil prices for Russia. It's Putin's strategy to improve the Russian economy & line Putin's pockets. We are collateral damage in Trump's world. Oh, and Trump may own a % of the largest Russian oil company.
1328 2018-05-28 20:54:17 Hard to think of MBS being a reformer when he starts so far off into radical corruption. Saudi's sew hatred throughout Islam and the rest of the world. Oil is the only reason they get away with it. Stop killing Yemeni to hurt Iran.

1331 2018-05-28 20:54:07 Interesting point as the Budwig diet highly recommends flax seed oil. Will need to do some more research on this.
1332 2018-05-28 20:54:06 Lmao if you don’t have self esteem before you are armed, you certainly won’t have self esteem after.
1333 2018-05-28 20:53:47 just watch out when cooking with butter.
 it's got a low smoke point. About 325-330.
A touch of canola oil which has a smoke point about 450 is better for that sear you may desire.
Yet to finish the steak while plating while sizzlin with that compound butter of choice...yummm!!
1334 2018-05-28 20:53:38 You are insulting my intelligence Zahara.

1348 2018-05-28 20:52:19 Because any administration with common sense (and not owned by a handful of actual billionaires) would be strategically reducing dependence on all oil for environmental and national security reasons. They found the dumbest horse and bet accordingly.

1373 2018-05-28 20:48:49 Cool yeah I found your website and reported right after I tweeted. Thank you! Having worked with transmissions before I know how much oil can be hiding in there, can be quite a mess.
1374 2018-05-28 20:48:41 I’m no oil painting but I’ve just seen a Hugo boss advert with Harry Kane - don’t look right

1378 2018-05-28 20:48:14 When the last drop of oil is taken from the ground, the Earth will heal fully within 30 years. The spent fuel so far from reactors will be around thousands of years from now and we have no place to store it. It is all at the plants and must be actively cooled. Major disaster.
1379 2018-05-28 20:48:12 Hmmm
1380 2018-05-28 20:48:09 Try whatever you can, exercise, socialising with mates, new activities, whole foods, less processed stuff. It does help. The cbd im finding does work but need the 1000mg oil to see a diff
1381 2018-05-28 20:47:55 I work at a strip club MAYBE once a week. I dance everyday, I workout, I read, I study, I’m enrolled in real estate courses, i do makeup, I can speak 2 languages, I change my own oil, I pray, I travel, I LIVE MY LIFE. I AM MY OWN BOSS. I’m not a stripper or any other label. #Scar
1382 2018-05-28 20:47:51 Maybe. But there are plenty of protagonists around hyping things. About oil, food scares, epidemics, vaccinations, storms, you name it. But still, should be some editors around who know that 100 litres = half a barrel.
1383 2018-05-28 20:47:42 Coconut oil cleared my skin up drastically after using it for only two days.
1384 2018-05-28 20:47:40 @AmyAldridge10 that’s your art ha. I’m published and I know how you made that. Anyone lay a canvas on a floor with a tarp and spill oil base paint on it.
1385 2018-05-28 20:47:33 Does anyone want an Oil update video as a technical analysis case study? Will try to isolate timeframes and explain my reasoning real time as I opened / closed trades.

Anyway, my husband is yelling, “Katie, there is oil on the BANANAS,” and I’m dying

1410 2018-05-28 20:45:08 And to hike the price of oil, of which Russia exports a lot...

1417 2018-05-28 20:44:35 I quit Western Medicine, it’s too expensive and dangerous. I am switching to Chinese Medicine, Accupuncture and high THC Cannabis Oil.
1418 2018-05-28 20:44:32 It shouldn't even be a stat. It measures nothing. Makes as much sense as checking your engine oil to determine if you have enough milk for your family to get through the week.
1419 2018-05-28 20:44:31 Little bit of valve cover oil leakage around the plugs, then it sits and bakes for who knows how long. Oil just begins to break down. Have had one set come out so bad it was sticky.

1429 2018-05-28 20:43:06 African black soap with shea butter is a miracle (over drying your skin makes it produce even more oil to compensate)
1430 2018-05-28 20:42:45 Well yes. If America wants to sell India cheaper Saudi oil then please do, but India will not act detrimentally to their own economy. Fuel prices are already on an all time high in India.

1483 2018-05-28 20:36:41 @POTUS Maybe their should be a traffic on oil with he way these oil barrens rip off the American Hard Working Families at the gasoline pumps. Time something is done to stop this. This is why the American Working Class can never get a head. Due to being gauged in every directions.
1484 2018-05-28 20:36:25 goodness gracious the oil on the stove just exploded so now I have experienced what the boys did during filming of their japanese mv, with black snoot and just black air everywhere

1486 2018-05-28 20:35:22 Go pour half a litre in the ocean and watch what it does. Make sure you let DFO know what you are doing before you do it though. and film it. On land, plants soak up some of that oil before any KM "cleaner upper" could ever get there. So how do you clean plant cells?

1490 2018-05-28 20:34:59 Dave if you think hate is the Democrats' platform, you're completely uninformed or misinformed about the party & HRC. Did you even bother reading her website? I did. She had great ideas like investing in clean, green energy (instead of raping the land for oil like DT is trying).
1491 2018-05-28 20:34:52 Thanks. This reminds me of my macroeconomics course where the text,prof. Written, said essentially that if oil prices reached a certain price the us economy would crash.
The text was the worst $35.00 (1974) I ever spent. One wasted semester.
1492 2018-05-28 20:34:44 @POTUS Looks like the big rich oil companies are going to get the extra money from tax bill. By ripping off the American Worker's due to gauging them at the pump every summer as they always do. Thought their was a law against price gauging. Guess Oil company's are exempt. Figures
1493 2018-05-28 20:34:21 "Dallas.  I got ranch in downtown Dallas; buy diamonds by the ton.  Chase cuties in my Cadillac; drill oil wells just for fun"

Or maybe that's just a boot store commercial.  Maybe.
1494 2018-05-28 20:34:18 So I read somewhere that coconut oil doesn’t effectively moisture your skin was it does do is create a barrier between whatever moisture/moisturizer you have on your skin and the elements.
1495 2018-05-28 20:34:13 If GEJ & Okonjo-lweala could borrow money to pay salaries when crude oil price was above $100 per barrel with daily production of 2.3 million barrel...

What would they have done if crude oil price was sold at $28 per barrel with daily production of 800,000 as at February, 2016
1496 2018-05-28 20:34:09 Need to change the oil in the GTO, but laying here watching Netflix sounds more productive right now.

"Yes, I am a car. I bounce on roads full of potholes. I require gasoline to move forward on a daily basis. Every few months, I need an oil change."

1499 2018-05-28 20:33:49 I’m guessing they went to the oil sands. The one place he can’t go for fear of internally combusting

1501 2018-05-28 20:33:23 Thanks Obama for helping ALL Americans break free from the shackles of Big Oil. We know now that there is a better, cleaner, more efficient way to live. Too bad that this illegitimate administration is dragging us back to the cave by our hair to submit to the tyranny of oil.

1504 2018-05-28 20:32:49 after i wash mine i put hair oil only towards the ends and let it air dry but every ten or so minutes i shake my roots out. i’ve also heard of people pinning their roots up while it dries so they don’t flatten!!
1505 2018-05-28 20:32:40 @SenateMajLdr Seems you elected officials seem to care more about the billionaire oil company's than you do those constituents who elect you. By allowing these oil company's to get away with ripping the American Working Class every summer. We will remember in next elections.
1506 2018-05-28 20:32:39 NPA Generates N1.2TR
IRS collects N2.3T in Tax
JAMB remits N75B
VAT earnings 2TR
Total Budget 7TR
Customs generates N1TR
But we can only fund 20% of the budget!  

Are we no longer selling CRUDE Oil?
What of other sources of revenue?

1507 2018-05-28 20:32:37 STOP!! Alqueda never had the power and finance of ISIS. ISIS was making millions a day off oil etc. and had it's own caliphate. Alqueda was protected by a government. ISIS was it's own government.
1508 2018-05-28 20:32:32 What’s your daily hair routine??? Water is your best friend, and oil if you really need it
1509 2018-05-28 20:32:27 Please protect them from corporate greed. In Utah, our local politicians @GovHerbert @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee @RepMiaLove @RepJohnCurtis @RepChrisStewart @RepRobBishop sold out our National Parks to oil and uranium mining, with help from @SecretaryZinke @POTUS #MonumentsForAll

1517 2018-05-28 20:31:41 Hard work for the oil pump and probably pretty crummy for lubrication during normal operation, I'd imagine. Sure to knock economy and response. I wouldn't put that in a tired '60s big block, let alone a modern engine (unless it was a modified powerplant on track). Very odd!
1518 2018-05-28 20:31:38 Does he use Factor 2 oil like my stepmom used to in the 80’s
1519 2018-05-28 20:31:32 Even Pakistan is cheaper ... most country where the oil is cheaper are small country or middle east... only two are exceptional  that is us and Russia.. but again these two countries have their own refinery too...
1520 2018-05-28 20:31:28 A cashier at academy wouldn’t let me buy rem oil cause apparently you have to be 18, it was all good though because my “uncle” in line behind me said he would buy it

1522 2018-05-28 20:31:18 Oil companies were stressed because they took the partial burden of selling gas at a loss so as to keep the price somewhat affordable. Today it's less because they are selling the oil at a profit to the govt.
1523 2018-05-28 20:31:11 @SenateMajLdr If you really care about your constituents. You would stop these billionaire oil companies from gauging the poor American Working Class out of a vacation due to ripping them off at the gas pump's every summer. This is ridiculous. Do you job  band stop it now.
1524 2018-05-28 20:31:11 In a world first, sales of electric vehicles in Norway have overtaken petrol and diesel-powered cars. EVs now make up 52% of the new car market. This from a nation which is sitting on enormous oil reserves.

1526 2018-05-28 20:30:58 @cta Who can clean up leaking oil from the tracks that is ruining cars, getting on animals and washing into our sewer/water system? The amount of oil dripping on the 4200 block of Kenmore is criminal and unsafe! FIX IT NOW!

My mind's like, how's this similar to SRST? Why did black ops go there? is it really oil?

1533 2018-05-28 20:29:41 It’s really rough - covered in skid marks, gouged, battered, blood, sweat, oil etc. Gonna put a glass top on it. We got the wood from @EMERGEWood - may still have some - there’s a lot of wood in a velodrome!

1538 2018-05-28 20:28:51 @SpeakerRyan If you really care about the American Working Class you would help employ congress to stop these billionaire oil companies stop gauging the poor American Working class out of a vacation. Due to the large increase at gasoline pump's every summer.

1542 2018-05-28 20:28:41 tips on how to shave ur lady areas, especially ur asshole: use a new razor w/ hella blades. men’s razors work better imo + they’re cheaper. use coconut oil or conditioner to moisturize (v important !!). shave in the direction of the hair. pat dry.
1543 2018-05-28 20:28:39 I need a oil change
1544 2018-05-28 20:28:31 Fact is what can be good to someone isn't always that good for another one so we can't just say that coconut oil isn't good at all

1547 2018-05-28 20:27:40 You’re not wrong to say private sector jobs have been lost, but I don’t think it’s fair to put that on the current gov’t. They inherited the worst drop in oil prices in a generation, in a province that had historically done little to mitigate against that contingency (under PCs).
1548 2018-05-28 20:27:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1549 2018-05-28 20:27:30 I unwittingly whored myself out to the “vultures who thirst for blood and oil” in the name of patriotism.
1550 2018-05-28 20:27:30 “You can’t shit talk the government and say you support the troops!” Yes I can. I just don’t think people should be risking their lives for a pointless war over oil while the government claims it’s to “protect our freedom”
1551 2018-05-28 20:27:22 I agree with that cuz we hear so much things about that coconut oil. My friend has a nice skin thanks to it so I wanted to try it but my pharmacist told me it would be too heavy for my skin but not for my hair. That's how I finally try it just on my hair and I'm okay gyal
1552 2018-05-28 20:27:00 Spent my life wearing factor 50 in fear of getting burnt. This weekend I’ve worn nothing and actually got a tan, get me some bloody carrot oil

1554 2018-05-28 20:26:49 @RepDeSantis Time thesee billionaire oil barren's stop gauging the poor American Working Class families out of a vacation due to gauging them every summer at gasoline pump. Maybe these billionaire oil barren's need to be fined or pay a tax  traffic base on their over charges.

1560 2018-05-28 20:25:49 The Saudi/UAE wins today against Iran’s houthi militias in Yemen are vital for global trade. 3 million barrels of oil pass through Red Sea straits Iran wanted to control, and a significant % of global trade between Asia and Europe.
1561 2018-05-28 20:25:47 i know alessia had a rough day so i'm making one of her favourite dishes and put lavender essential oil in our humidifier bc it stimulates relaxations and honestly i feel like such a housewife
1562 2018-05-28 20:25:34 i just want you all to know that i started rubbing coconut oil on my feet before bed awhile ago because my feet were cracked & scaly & not only did it make my feet not cracked & scaly anymore it's also demolishing my toenail fungus please hire me
1563 2018-05-28 20:25:08 Fucking @Fallout 4 can go fuck it’s self with all this building and scavenging bollocks, 3 hours to find some fucking oil cans THAT I had to steal in the end and ended up disappointing Nick Valentine with my decision to steal the oil, FUCK YOU NICK!!!
1564 2018-05-28 20:25:05 Lol when did I explicitly state support for Iran? It is utterly pathetic to attribute statement to me I didn't make. 
Iran does what it does for its reason. It's not innocent
So is the American government that interfered in its internal politics because of oil
1565 2018-05-28 20:25:04 False protection? How so? It’s probably the only thing that is real protection. The police or waiting for someone to save you is closer to false than taking responsibility

Needs to stop now. Maybe they should be fined.

1580 2018-05-28 20:22:47 Yes. I'm no vet or expert of any kind but I have owned mannnyyy cats in my life, some ageing to 16-20yo and my understanding is that they get matted fur especially on the back/legs because their ability to clean themselves, properly, decreases/increased oil production from skin.
1581 2018-05-28 20:22:47 correct and weakening oil accelerates this move.
1582 2018-05-28 20:22:32 I don’t know if people realize, but a spill in an ocean—even if it is only the fill size of two Honda Civics—is detrimental to the unique and fragile marine life and environment which inhabit the B.C. coast. Once in water, oil is terribly hard to remove.
1583 2018-05-28 20:22:31 I think, I'm addicted to cajuput oil ㅠㅠ
1584 2018-05-28 20:22:18 If you go oil slick you can call it “grackle” and be the mother of grackles.

1588 2018-05-28 20:22:01 Yep and the payroll of the Saudi's since the oil crises.
1589 2018-05-28 20:22:01 @Jim_Jordan It's time these billionaire oil companies are stopped gauging the poor American Working Class families who can't take a vacation due to the gasoline prices doubling during summer months. Time these oil barren's are stopped hitting the poor working class families
1590 2018-05-28 20:21:57 Nonsense. You cant clean up oil. Ever.
1591 2018-05-28 20:21:54 My favourite Crisps by a Russian mile.
1592 2018-05-28 20:21:40 That's corporatists. And let's be clear - you're using oil daily, as am I. To power your car, your phone, your computer. To make the plastics, to lubricate the engines. It comes with risks. That's reality. Stop using all those things then you'll have a point.
1593 2018-05-28 20:21:37 If you're being serious, 100l of oil would barely cover the drain of an Olympic pool.

1599 2018-05-28 20:20:33 I looooove the taste of sunflower oil.
1600 2018-05-28 20:20:28 10w60 is spec'd by Alfa for several models/engines. I'm not 100% convinced it's actually the right oil. It certainly reduces oil consumption...
1601 2018-05-28 20:20:27 love the smell of tanning oil
1602 2018-05-28 20:20:24 People should absolutely step up when the government (for ex.) starts throwing ethnic groups into death camps, but we're talking about something that greatly benefits the country with jobs and higher prices paid for oil.  Something that's already been approved.
1603 2018-05-28 20:20:22 this is the only party leader to stand up and take a hit in defense of her constituents' interests rather than those of the oil & gas industry. bravo, @ElizabethMay, you are an inspiration and a true Canadian patriot
1604 2018-05-28 20:20:21 Happy greesing, gear oil change for both mom and son. Is he really. Her son ? Homo, gay ? May be , not sure.
1605 2018-05-28 20:20:20 Ohh it’s like any other fire. You just add a bit more oil, put a bit of laal mirchi for the aroma and a bit more of jealousy. That should do the trick I guess. When unsure, just pouring a lot of ego. It always works!
1606 2018-05-28 20:20:13 Nope. I know of the U-boat that landed in Ponte Vedra and dumped off four Germans, and of the sub that sank the oil tanker just off Jax Beach, but I don't know of a sunken u-boat.
1607 2018-05-28 20:20:11 I think I might have some sort of an allergic reaction to oil paint

1609 2018-05-28 20:20:04 Brent crude  continues to bleed on Monday after profit taking has accelerated late  last week, with the price dropped to three-week lows around $74,50. Oil  attracted buyers on a dip and has recovered slightly early Monday but  remains in the red as output concerns still linger.
1610 2018-05-28 20:19:45 Oil, diamonds, cobalt, emeralds, mining rights, arms deals. It's corrupt war mongering politicians that drive war.  Always has been for nearly all wars. It's all back to front. Why die for them. Better to kill the politicians wanting war
1611 2018-05-28 20:19:45 FAKE news - so we’re clear - skyrocketed gas prices we’re seeing? Thanks lying crazy Don for killing the Iran deal, (bonus - pissing off Europe) & shooting up the price of oil.  Bone spurs is irresponsible & while the daily mayheim is entertaining,  this is not a reality show
1612 2018-05-28 20:19:34 @POTUS In fact, gasoline prices need to be brought in line with what American Hard working families earn. Not set by these greedy billionaire oil company's. Maybe these oil barrens need to pay a traffic on their oil products. If their going to gauge the poor worker's
1613 2018-05-28 20:19:27 People are using baby oil to tan 
1614 2018-05-28 20:19:26 US and UK markets closed for holidays but Europe provided interest via Italian politics. Tensions in coalition, populist faction threatening to force another election.

Look at how much these oil company's are worth and profits they make off gauging the American Workers every summer. Time their stopped.

 The sound of a hundred thousand coming down the road. We are the vibration that yuh feel when the music load. We are the mud and the oil and we come to dutty up the clothes and make the gyal them wine and strike the electric pose.

1634 2018-05-28 20:16:19 Shout out to the troops that have died fighting for oil
1635 2018-05-28 20:16:19 Liverpool are actually going for it and we are yet to bring out the oil money
1636 2018-05-28 20:16:18 Hello.. I Want to ask that if you know anything about turkey transport oil to israel. There is some News about it on twetter.
1637 2018-05-28 20:16:05 It’s so easy to do ur calculations mr I understand common sense isn’t too much n most persons aren’t good with numbers. I clearly said oil sales in my tweets. Sometimes u should try n read properly so u can understand d tweet before responding to it.
1638 2018-05-28 20:16:04 You go know d diff btw gidi and abj. After you spend 4hrs dey drag bus with starch shirt
1639 2018-05-28 20:15:55 Oh really....Iran has given loan to India. 55% of oil payments well held back, as payments through Hallback were stopped in 2013 due to US sanctions. After lifting of sanctions the payment is now made by IOC n UBI. Don't assume other person will take the baloney.
1640 2018-05-28 20:15:52 History of now.
1641 2018-05-28 20:15:46 Until we realise we just signed the wrong Fabinho (Hughes signed one just when the oil money came in)
1642 2018-05-28 20:15:37 bunch of dumbasses!  Clearing the way for Saudi oil. Opening more arguments for transport over water which is far worse for the environment. Not knowing the difference between old pipelines and new pipelines. Free education in the country and people parrot what the numskulls say
1643 2018-05-28 20:15:31 Been there! Try borage oil as a daily supplement, and when it flares, Alleve and Hot water bottle...it worked for me. After I had my son, I got a Mirena #IUD which did wonders.
1644 2018-05-28 20:15:28 Damn I forgot about that oil.
1645 2018-05-28 20:15:25 Use a cleansing oil or balm; stay away from foaming cleansers and wipes. Look for serum and moisturizer with high hyluronic acid content. Avoid products with denatured alcohol (it’s drying)
1646 2018-05-28 20:15:21 i used bio oil some months ago but nothing happened :(
1647 2018-05-28 20:15:20 $CL_F: Decline from 72.84 in #Oil is impulsive and should see more downside while rally fails below there #elliottwave
1648 2018-05-28 20:15:16 But u can use whatever oil u want
1649 2018-05-28 20:15:16 @POTUS The hard working class worker's elected you. Their needs to be a stop to oil company's ripping off the poor Hard Working American Class every summer on price gauging these poor American worker's who can't afford to take a vacation due to this reason.
1650 2018-05-28 20:15:15 If the bunker fuels needed for shipping tar sands oil increases in price is there a problem? Lol a pipeline too nowhere 
1651 2018-05-28 20:15:07 If you’ve got time to relax today, try a hot soak in a tub, with an ounce or two of magnesium oil. #Monday #relax #relaxation #MemorialDay
1652 2018-05-28 20:15:04 Jamaican black castor oil & the the growth oil in a white bottle
1653 2018-05-28 20:15:02 War, in the greater sense of understanding its impact on a region, is best understood as the escalation and eventual 'military solution' of individual conflicts, each when combined with all the others create 'a means to an end' towards the main goal. #3rdTemple #Oil #YinonPlan
1654 2018-05-28 20:15:02 Every time I run out of food and I know it’s pointless to buy more groceries, I throw on some whole grain pasta, put some avocado oil and lemon pepper MMMMMM BRUH
1655 2018-05-28 20:14:58 ... did you just equate oil companies to isis?  Holy fuck... this site makes me incredibly pessimistic about the future of our society
1656 2018-05-28 20:14:46 Let her fashii him,he must call back
1657 2018-05-28 20:14:43 For me represents the pennies they got while scum bag politicians siphoned oil deals, arms deals, diamond deals. All they ended up with was a tomb stone and pennies. War is complete nonsense 95% of the time. Better to kill corrupt war mongering politicians
1658 2018-05-28 20:14:10 Lemon is very cleansing and clearing! A great immune booster & antimicrobial. If you would like more information on this oil or any other essential oils stop by the shop, message me on here or call or text 306-606-9011
1659 2018-05-28 20:14:09 lol...ah, Schumer told you that.  So was it Trumps fault in 2014 as well? I was always told Presidents don't control domestic oil & gas prices. At least that's what they told me when gas was so high during Obama.
1660 2018-05-28 20:14:07 Let's do in those oil pigs this time 
1661 2018-05-28 20:13:51 Emmie has been asleep for 3+ hours and 1. I’m jealous 2. Thank god for lavender oil
1662 2018-05-28 20:13:44 Eating a whole foods plant based vegan diet will without a doubt prevent heart disease. Atherosclerosis cannot build up in the arteries. An oil and junk filled vegan diet sure heart disease can still be present.
1663 2018-05-28 20:13:44 67 years behind and all that oil revenue. Spectacular failure.
1664 2018-05-28 20:13:42 Step 1: Join @AROC_UKofficial
Step 2: Buy your oil from @opieoils using your AROC UK discount.
1665 2018-05-28 20:13:31 Direct the figures to Ibe not me, you’ll be blind to think we only revenue money from oil, that’s some daft analyses with oil prices fluctuating up and down, lol, yeah sure them no go put sugar for your mouth you spit am comot, come and be going

1671 2018-05-28 20:12:41 I used wild growth oil and black castor oil
1672 2018-05-28 20:12:41 The solar panels help carrying around all the coal of course! I heard that the average solar panel can lift up to 200 pounds! That's a lot of coal and way more than oil can lift, which is about 0.92g/cm³
1673 2018-05-28 20:12:37 btw does it take oil and coal to manufacture these electrric vehicles and to mine and refine the lithium for their batteries? Why, yes it does.

1676 2018-05-28 20:12:06 #Ayo When you put on lavender oil and think you’re gonna get compliments on it but somebody yells out “Who the fuck that is smelling like a old lady”....
1677 2018-05-28 20:12:02 Hey girl, what kind of oil? Like olive oil or?
1678 2018-05-28 20:11:57 Probably a lack of MCT oil resulting in the condition known as Slow Brainz.

(In case this makes me seem like the only nice one, she spoils the hell out of me at every opportunity, too.)
1679 2018-05-28 20:11:52 Me has salmon oil as well, I also has sardines or mackyrel for brekkie a few days a week & raw the rest of the time
1680 2018-05-28 20:11:52 Oil LFC blood money you are the big spenders now hahahaha
1681 2018-05-28 20:11:50 And God created it that way!! Could never understand why anyone would buy a book on global warming by Al Gore. He'd sell Snake oil and the same people would buy that product too!
1682 2018-05-28 20:11:48 Machines don’t get tired. They just get oil changes.
1683 2018-05-28 20:11:32 Dream is for @KeraCare to bring out a handbag sized oil sheen.
1684 2018-05-28 20:11:25 You do not have to respect other people’s “builds” in the car community. If it’s a clapped out shit box, a dangerous stanced car, or a played out brodozer, we don’t have to like it. Go share Honda memes on Facebook and vlog about how you can’t change your oil
1685 2018-05-28 20:11:25 I think I need to pop a dipstick into mine and asses the oil level.
1686 2018-05-28 20:11:11 I never ever read this or Snopes

1688 2018-05-28 20:10:55 Margaret Thatcher famously said "the problem with Socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money." Venezuela ran out of (oil) money.
1689 2018-05-28 20:10:37 Used avocado oil as a tanning oil this weekend and I have the perfect tan 
1690 2018-05-28 20:10:21 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
1691 2018-05-28 20:10:14 Hey, I just remember you’re the one that said we don’t currently ship oil to Asia but in the last 1.5 weeks at least 3 ships from Asia filled up and sailed west, which I proved to you but you went silent.... 

Remember?
1692 2018-05-28 20:10:12 Coconut oil between folds works well too
1693 2018-05-28 20:10:08 Endless oil story
1694 2018-05-28 20:10:07 Hitler was famous for his pro citizen firearm ownership policy. He wouldn't have waited all these years to have Embassy in Jerusalem either
1695 2018-05-28 20:10:05 Freaking dislike the smell of ‘axe oil’
1696 2018-05-28 20:09:59 When the famed trading houses of the Niger Delta were selling palm oil to British traders, they didn't know that the British were making breakthroughs in treating tropical diseases, and perfecting plans to take over their entire businesses & their land.
1697 2018-05-28 20:09:55 Transmission Oil Line Leak and Engine Oil Drippage Leak added to that Exhaust Muffler & Catalytic Converter Heat makes for a fair fire under vehicle during hot days.
1698 2018-05-28 20:09:51 We hate troops so much that we don't want to send them to die in useless wars over oil and resources. Remind me again who started our current unending war? It's like an abusive spouse - "I love you so go die for me". Smh
1699 2018-05-28 20:09:34 "Die for oil, suckers!"
1700 2018-05-28 20:09:17 Oil is in everything. It’s not just for transportation. Your comment is ignorant but understandable as that’s how you have been programmed to think. Cheap reliable energy is what helps and lifts people and nations out of poverty and misery.
1701 2018-05-28 20:09:04 not a medical doctor but I’m an “auto doctor.” In my field, fluid flushes are the big snake oil. Why? Not needed nearly as often as sold if one follows the mfgr’s maintenance schedule. Oversold as chemical company reps spiff mgrs & mechanics to sell.

1704 2018-05-28 20:08:32 Asked if Trumpy could affect fuel costs, Schumer said that Trump should pressure OPEC. "He's very, very tight with the crown prince, He's very tight with the UAE, very tight, supposedly, with Putin. Why doesn't he use that? Oil companies just got a big tax break. Jawbone them."

1706 2018-05-28 20:08:06 Add any ground provision to saltfish and oil and you will have the most amazing dish ever. Green bananas, breadfruit and yam are the best to go with that tho
1707 2018-05-28 20:07:51 The real question is do I wanna waste a whole ass cup of olive oil in order to make an eggless chocolate cake and will it still be good if I use brown sugar instead of white
1708 2018-05-28 20:07:42 Joe from Spuzzum says you are a US oil company shill.
1709 2018-05-28 20:07:36 I should learn from him and oil myself up too. :D

1712 2018-05-28 20:06:56 a good hack is taking that coffee and a spoon of butter (or coconut oil), throwing it in a blender (or magic bullet, much easier) whipping it up. the healthy fats from the butter or coconut oil are awesome for the brain. It's my new thing, and I don't plan on stopping. also eat.
1713 2018-05-28 20:06:50 I agree with the Tania, but yam?? Have you had sticky yam with saltfish and oil, and pounded breadfruit with a lentil and chicken stew, or saltfish mapa??????
1714 2018-05-28 20:06:42 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
1715 2018-05-28 20:06:36 Depends on when your last oil change was.
1716 2018-05-28 20:06:35 going to guess and say.... Renaissance, Baroque Oil Paintings
1717 2018-05-28 20:06:34 C'mon1 If you owned a TV station you'd ask your pals oil!
1718 2018-05-28 20:06:00 Try diffusing eucalyptus and lavender oil, also eating a breakfast high in fat and protein has helped me!
1719 2018-05-28 20:05:49 So basically Nigeria earns over $3.5b monthly from d sale of crude oil n over $46b annually. 
So common sense should tell u that $25b can’t just vanish like that. 
Stop being petty n think about figures very well before putting it out there for people to c
1720 2018-05-28 20:05:43 This is why the Dems are countering by attempting to blame @POTUS for high gas prices, even as they obstruct exploration,drilling, pipelines, refineries and oil terminals.
1721 2018-05-28 20:05:39 Call a supermarket. Ask if they have olive oil there. Then start yelling on the phone saying Popeye is looking for her. ( hope u know who popeye is. )Lol.
1722 2018-05-28 20:05:26 “You know when it rains HERE thousands of litres of oil, fuels, lubricants get washed into the ocean. Marinas and fuel docks easily spill this much and more every single day.”

This is your statement. No much truth in it!
1723 2018-05-28 20:05:25 Interesting that Nenshi the Mayor of Oil City who thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room could have the stupidity to accept a Free$$ Trip from people opposed to our  KM pipeline. Can he be bought? You be the judge? We are so screwed with this fool  as our Mayor. Olympics?

1729 2018-05-28 20:04:50 Old machine oil I suppose I should say.
1730 2018-05-28 20:04:33 Thanks Purrc!  The Rhino is seldom without his Oil Product, which helps capture all those ambient colors  -^  ^-
1731 2018-05-28 20:04:30 I am sure the Norwegians are desparte to had over their oil wealth &  rich fishing grounds to the EU.

Opps, maybe the EU is desperate to get its paws on the Norwegian  sovreigen Fund, unlike the UK, profits from oil were put in a savings account, not frivelled  away.
1732 2018-05-28 20:04:24 Sure, but not relevant in dirty wars for opium, coca in,  oil, emeralds, diamonds. Then it's murder of others. And 95% the wars just that. This whole patriotism thing a little upside down at times, back to front
1733 2018-05-28 20:04:19 Snake venom or snake oil? 
1734 2018-05-28 20:04:03 Would it be the Western worlds dependence on Arab countries oil that is causing this blind ignorance of what Islam is doing to their Nations?
1735 2018-05-28 20:04:02 The lack of oil drips is hard to spot amongst the coating of diesel we get on the roads instead.
1736 2018-05-28 20:04:01 Gas prices are the highest they’ve been in nearly four years despite the multibillion-dollar windfall that oil companies received from the GOP-backed tax bill. And you can blame higher prices on Trump’s chaotic, incoherent foreign policy.

1740 2018-05-28 20:02:56 Nothing returns the energy that costs to make them. We never factor the cost of wars and military bases protecting oil fields and the military costs protecting shipping lanes. The cost is in lives lost is staggering.

1747 2018-05-28 20:02:12 Right? That's said, I recently had some "Greek Slaw" from the Italian deli. It was oil and vinegar based, but only just enough vinegar to help,break down the cabbage. It alsomhad Kalamata olives, and it was swell.
1748 2018-05-28 20:02:00 Cos he's constantly eating and most of his food is swimming in olive oil.
1749 2018-05-28 20:02:00 & not just physical injury to a terminally ill person. Or not-we don't know because states w RTT don't see anyone using the authority. Maybe it's a nothingburger, but it could peddle snake oil to desperate ppl and leave fams w huge $ burdens & docs/manufacturers in legal limbo
1750 2018-05-28 20:01:56 @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi Dear Dharmendra ji, please have your homework before giving some falsely statement towards the nation. Crude oil prices had decreased today while you tried to full the people of the republic saying it's increased. We don't eats grass. Be ware of 2019.
1751 2018-05-28 20:01:53 If she had done the exact opposite of Trump, as she and dems in general indicate, this is true.
1752 2018-05-28 20:01:50  talk about haters.dont read that sh#t. Check out cbd oil for ptsd,adhd n depression. Ridalyn has same side effects as speed n cocaine. SO PROUD OF U n ur going to get to the title. For u n so many other fighters, it’s 98% mental n rest is physical n technique. NAMASTE
1753 2018-05-28 20:01:43 Nigeria produces on average of 2m barrels of crude oil daily, now multiple that number by $50 which is sup to b d bench mark of oil price u will get $100m daily, if u multiple that figure by 30 u will get $3.9b monthly.
1754 2018-05-28 20:01:42 I saw cockroaches way back selling while talking heads were BSing on TV for $100 oil
1755 2018-05-28 20:01:42 Yeah i only use coconut oil to shave and to remove my make up. I heard it’s not good for your face either but i haven’t made the switch yet

1763 2018-05-28 20:00:51 I won’t indulge you because I can see what a pathetic person you are. You go and attack someone’s looks when they disagree with your shallow points. Honestly how old are you ? Like I said hambe pholisha isiphongo sakho nge Mukwa oil wekele ukusibangela umsindo lapha

1766 2018-05-28 20:00:41 Just witnessed a dead body getting pulled out of the Allegheny in Oil City.
1767 2018-05-28 20:00:39 Yeah, being patriotic now means supporting the bombing of other countries with oil fields that we want. #britainsgottalent

1772 2018-05-28 20:00:20 Poor Johnny Capo--hates himself, knows he's in the wrong, blusters and fumes, which will never change the fact that he willingly voted for a Russian-owned, money-laundering, snake oil salesman and that his life will not be made better, but instead worse, for it. Poor Johnny.

1779 2018-05-28 19:59:40 Correction: mail-in is *convenient*. Not secure enough to be trusted. I know places that do it drink snake oil regularly.
1780 2018-05-28 19:59:25 Petrol price is too high and crude oil is at low price 
Bhakt - sonia went abroad for her health check up

1781 2018-05-28 19:59:21 About to go to sleep at the car dealership trying to get my oil changed  
1782 2018-05-28 19:59:01 If the oil price spikes it affects every level of society. We’re not just talking about gas for your car. And btw. Trump’s signature will be on a renegotiated Iran deal. That I can assure you of.
1783 2018-05-28 19:58:57 #gop republicans want to restart the draft, now if your kids live through the school shootings they can go to a foreign country to get killed defending oil, or one of tRump’s hotels. Wake up America republicans & tRump are the Nazi’s of 2018.
1784 2018-05-28 19:58:46 Oil slick
1785 2018-05-28 19:58:43 Please remind me to get my last free oil change while I'm home.
1786 2018-05-28 19:58:42 It’s just so heavy. I stopped using coconut oil & started using lighter ones instead since I have low porosity hair. I heard coconut oil is better for high por... but I’m not enthused by it either way tbh. Lol.
1787 2018-05-28 19:58:40 The re-imposition of economic sanctions on Iran will enrich the remaining oil producing states and oil companies. In addition to our higher costs, this will create turmoil & tension w allies. All just because of jealousy & hate for Obama. Real.
1788 2018-05-28 19:58:28 The only thing I changed was that I used brown ghee instead of duck fat or olive oil.
1789 2018-05-28 19:58:27 I caught it after the fact.
1790 2018-05-28 19:58:16 I agree Trump does not help anything. Opec is the only authority of oil producing countries and only look out for 2 of the group (imo). It's time to change the entire system.

1793 2018-05-28 19:58:09 You really can't blame government for trying to fix decades of poor management. The oil industry is nearly dead, would Albertans prefer massive unemployment? As bad as it is, AB still refuses to pay sales taxes while insisting on services, so borrow and spend it is.

1797 2018-05-28 19:57:50 Please, that’s just Pumpherston. The Pumpherston Retort is world famous for having been the most effective way of extracting oil from shale. If you want to do Pumpherston vs Yorkshire we can.

1799 2018-05-28 19:57:39 Tried Bog Myrtle? A wee sprig stuck in your lapel is worth a go. Not sure where you would find it in the city though. Skin So Soft does work for me, and lots of folks wear by Lavender essential oil for mosquitoes. Best of luck....

1801 2018-05-28 19:57:18 I’m no big sweet tooth but had some cracking cakes so far. There’s like an orange sponge cake that’s seeping with orange jam/oil. Not sure which as I was leathered. Fucking ace though.
1802 2018-05-28 19:57:16 You need an oil change
1803 2018-05-28 19:57:14 Again, I agree with you. As a matter of calling their bluff. Stop getting hung up on compromising, I never said to compromise.

1810 2018-05-28 19:56:23 Nothing can ever be 100% perfect. Pipelines are the safest method to transport oil and their safety systems are constantly being improved.
1811 2018-05-28 19:55:59 I honestly feel like coconut oil behaves similar to that as well 
1812 2018-05-28 19:55:32 Where can I get a oil change In Modesto
1813 2018-05-28 19:55:32 And how many days will coal be around? As far as PR, do you think that EIA is a propaganda agent for big oil? They seem to think that we will be dependent on oil for a long time.
1814 2018-05-28 19:55:19 Och, aye. Interesting which blogs get shared and by whom. Oil is running out etc. It's tedious. I'm not convinced people are that interested in the microeconomics. There is more to gained, and lost

Otherwise, like everything the idiot purposes it did zero good.

1825 2018-05-28 19:54:21 I’m sure this jives with the massive oil spills that destroy huge swaths of water.
1826 2018-05-28 19:54:18 Just bet my moms bf I’d change the oil in my car all by myself next time. Easy bet...
1827 2018-05-28 19:54:17 You are right. Gas prices will be affected temporarily. Now think about what they would be like if we weren’t exploring and drilling and pumping oil again?!?! We are now on our way to energy independence. Under your “hero” Obama, we’d be buying more oil...

1837 2018-05-28 19:52:55 Not for money. Not for oil!
1838 2018-05-28 19:52:35 Kind of sounds like what Obama said.
1839 2018-05-28 19:52:32 Agreed, I'm referring to a mentod of engagement, don't compromise. When they bring up compromise, ask them what they would be willing to compromise on. Put that ball in their court, see what they do with it and go from there.
1840 2018-05-28 19:52:28 We get it. The progressive gun grabbers are rarely honest about it though, so many of us have stopped trying.

1900 2018-05-28 19:45:58 Dip the water you boiled inside oil and eat.. 
1901 2018-05-28 19:45:57 Ok and the crude oil from 66.5 to? What is your idea ?
1902 2018-05-28 19:45:48 Stay away hot oil is in the mix
1903 2018-05-28 19:45:41 On a risk-adjusted basis, the USA is the world’s most likely long term swing producer.  Mid-East is a much higher risk environment.  Particularly since the Russians MUST have high oil prices, and the military industrial complex is their other major source of hard currency.
1904 2018-05-28 19:45:35 Aguero, Silva, Toure, Zabaleta, Hart and several others worked their socks off for the club.
Say what you want to about 'oil money', 'plastic fans', and the usual drivel
But you can't deny they were proper professionals and more importantly, good people
1905 2018-05-28 19:45:22 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1906 2018-05-28 19:45:12 Please, don't give me that olive oil bullshit. I'm a sunflower-oiler!

1910 2018-05-28 19:44:52 Weird bdd things I do:
. Brush my teeth too much and for too long
. Excessive and obsessive skin care
. Putting a lot of oil and serum on my hair/washing it too much or not at all
1911 2018-05-28 19:44:51 I love black castor oil
1912 2018-05-28 19:44:37 Liverpool buying an entire new midfield this summer while getting rid of that useless oil tanker Emre Can. This is what heaven must be like.
1913 2018-05-28 19:44:32 Alright, let's rephrase Rarely Hurt People to Rarely vaporizes small towns, collapses bridges, wipes out huge sections of highway or neighborhoods with derailments.  If oil is going to be moved all I'm getting at is that there *is* a reasonable debate about how we define safety.
1914 2018-05-28 19:44:13 Most BMW  get an oil change after 12,000- 15,000 miles . Read your manuel girl lol 
1915 2018-05-28 19:44:12 Your comments seem very biased, you want to make oil companies out to be villians, while being green is the only path to a better future, the energy mix is changing but without the current our way life would send us backwards, You must grow all your own ...

1919 2018-05-28 19:44:05 So if I buy hemp oil, I can vape it and get high? This is a grand revelation.
1920 2018-05-28 19:43:55 Consumed by Hannity Hatred so much you can't see that Trump is a snake oil salesman. Trump is a fraud of a patriot. He knows one thing only. Money. He sure as heck isn't spreading any your way. And the last time he thought about your god was when it made him money.
1921 2018-05-28 19:43:52 Google suggests two alternatives for oil of swallows - one with actual swallows one with elder leaves and fat

Trying not to think of the worms....
1922 2018-05-28 19:43:35 - tea tree oil is very helpful for all skin types and personally improved all blemishes on my skin. If you don’t want to put tea tree oil straight on your face buy something that has tea tree infused in it (it doesn’t smell the best but it works)
- drink water bby it helps
1923 2018-05-28 19:43:34 Ask muricans I have no idea tbh maybe they put butter instead of oil while frying it

1926 2018-05-28 19:43:31 I use to pay $20 for my oil change

1929 2018-05-28 19:43:02 One and half sef. Then he will change his mind and come back to add another half tablespoon of oil. 
1930 2018-05-28 19:42:58 If you change your oil after 5k miles I feel so bad for your car

1934 2018-05-28 19:42:18 Anyone remember the big scare about 'Peak Oil' 15 years ago or so?

This is one thing that 'disappeared'.

Some predicted the high prices of oil in the 2008-2014 period would kill demand, but instead they spurred new production.
1935 2018-05-28 19:42:10 I've gone as far as I can in indulging anti Vax over the years. It's just not in the same league as real science. The proponents are usually profiteers and snake oil salesmen. Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. Yet the solid evidence is *never* there.
1936 2018-05-28 19:41:51 I cannot live without coconut oil.

1940 2018-05-28 19:41:18 yea but I know I should have an oil change by now right?
1941 2018-05-28 19:41:17 looks like I don't have any oil on hand but I did open up the bottom and removed a ton of lint so hopefully that helps
1942 2018-05-28 19:41:14 And so awesome that he  cut regulations on offshore oil rigs. Those things are waaaaay to safe anyway.
1943 2018-05-28 19:41:05 Evan, wake up FFS. They want the sanctions lifted, they lost a fortune with low oil price and sanctions. Trump didn’t deliver on sanctions  but incompetence is still causing chaos of course that’s still a win/win for Putin, There is opportunity if there is  chaos in US for Russia

1947 2018-05-28 19:41:00 Tens of millions of gallons of oil enter Can/US oceans each year due to cars, etc & only 8% comes from oil pipeline spills according to U.S. National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, which is considered authority on oil-spill data #kindermorgan
1948 2018-05-28 19:40:43 I’m all for laying off the oil dependency but my ashy knees and elbows and dry feet make me a bad environmentalist.
1949 2018-05-28 19:40:38 Mostly they were sacrificed for oil companies, banks and arms manufacturers profits, not freedom.
1950 2018-05-28 19:40:30 can rosehip oil clog pores?
1951 2018-05-28 19:40:26 Bout time oil prices drop
1952 2018-05-28 19:40:24 That's the sound of infringement. Yeah, we're good here.
1953 2018-05-28 19:40:20 Sprinkle lots of oil over it.  It helps it slide off the plate and into the bin far more easily!
1954 2018-05-28 19:40:15 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
1955 2018-05-28 19:40:02 I don't know what I'm talking about? What have I said that is wrong? Everything I said is a fact. Brent Crude oil is curtently $75.30 which is down 4.18% from last week.
1956 2018-05-28 19:39:57 Baby oil is on, time to fryyyy
1957 2018-05-28 19:39:55 That’s because Paul Ryan is a liar & snake oil salesman.

1961 2018-05-28 19:39:31 Let’s see, who is a big winner from higher oil prices? Oh yeah, Comrade Putin. How convenient, his North American Regional Manager, trump, is helping him so much.
1962 2018-05-28 19:39:19 Your MCM thinks coconut oil is a moisturizer
1963 2018-05-28 19:39:10 My car is at 6k miles and I still haven’t got a service alert for an oil change. My car broke?
1964 2018-05-28 19:39:09 I doubt they are any more than symbolic. Oil is the only export and that was destroyed long before sanctions and oil is not sanctioned
1965 2018-05-28 19:39:01 I think you did a good job of that. It's just....frustrating as hell to keep having to give. And the left just wants more. First, ARs. and large mags. Then All semi-autos. Now, all.
1966 2018-05-28 19:38:59 k my fave salad ever: 1 bunch kale, washed/dried, stems removed, torn into ribbons. massaged with juice of 1 lemon, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper. w/ bacon, pita crumbs (i just toast 2 and blitz in the food processor) & cheese. boooom it's like junk food but with kale
1967 2018-05-28 19:38:39 No, you’re spreading lies to trivialize the spill in Kamloops and just justify putting 7X’s more oil tankers through Metro Vancouver. If you have a good reason to support the #TMX come out with it! Don’t make up lies to justify your position!
1968 2018-05-28 19:38:15 Sweet Almond Oil, Vitamin E, & even Apricot Oil is good for you though
1969 2018-05-28 19:38:13 Hurricane Alberto makes me want to put a hot oil conditioning treatment on my hair.

1972 2018-05-28 19:37:59 Ya’ll Don’t Be On Here Trying To Slander Coconut Oil For The Face 
1973 2018-05-28 19:37:51 Yes. Coconut oil is a sealant of sorts which is why it works well for hair. Your skin doesn't need that haha

1976 2018-05-28 19:37:35 More voting unions to keep Tulsi in office. Isn't it an election yr. Only time we hear from Tulsi. Most of the time she's protesting oil pipe lines instead of rebuilding our old infrastructure!
1977 2018-05-28 19:37:35 "Well, if you say so. I probably shouldn't push it.

But great! You get the sunscreen and towels, I'll get the tan oil and beach umbrellas. And then... I dunno, I'll text everybody invitations, or something."

1985 2018-05-28 19:36:25 The oil revenues, Have allowed successive Governments. To ignore the terrible state the UK economy has been in for many decades. North sea oil revenues, have been used exclusively, to support, and disguise, an economy that does not work.
1986 2018-05-28 19:36:23 Wouldn't be so bad if the US quit meddling in their elections and government, but hey, that oil looks good.
1987 2018-05-28 19:36:21 So you say police shootings were declining until  protest (like kneeling) began ? Cops are less likely to die on the job than oil field workers , miners , garbage me and  dozens of other occupations... all while shootings by police are barely beinging to be tracked accurately
1988 2018-05-28 19:36:19 As the productive population and those able to afford it flee, the less productive are left. Economic productivity falls even further.
1989 2018-05-28 19:36:18 Corporate levels of Islam have used Islamic oil profits to buy into Comerica Bank, the bank that 'carries' the ownership paper on America. Hostile takeover (majority stock buy in) of that bank results in ability to control USA gov't. The implementation of Sharia Law is imminent.
1990 2018-05-28 19:36:16 Coconut oil on hair makes it so good, but ugh I don't know how much is too much and now I have to wash my hair again OTL
1991 2018-05-28 19:36:10 Then why isn’t it in the question of these polls you are relying on so heavily to justify selling oil half way across the planet to Asia when Alberta already has their biggest and best customer right across their southern border?
1992 2018-05-28 19:36:05 Just finished cooking beans and eating then I remembered an Oyo state boy who uses 2 spoon of palm oil to cook beans... Surprising... @WhatisaRo @allen4goodtime @iamChuChuLee can confirm my story.... Nagode
1993 2018-05-28 19:35:51 CNN: “Oil prices surged to their highest level in over three years last week, and strategists were marveling that prices had shot up so quickly. Now prices are slumping.” This is awesome. To me it means gas prices should be 1.88 and my 2.88. Wth.
1994 2018-05-28 19:35:51 Wonder why I haven’t seen tweets today from @TheDemocrats like @NancyPelosi and @chuckschumer about falling oil prices? #AskedAnswered

And I am still writing.
I started the Parky espionage books about 8 to 10 years. I wrote off an Israeli Agent who was next to the Tory UK Prime Minister & eventually Parky killed him & called him a fool. The Defence Minister had shares in weapons & ran an oil hijack.
2002 2018-05-28 19:34:24 Why is it the right thing to do, because you say so? Why do we need to transform Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port, risk the people’s safety and the sensitive marine ecosystem these tankers will be ssailing over to sell oil to Asia?
2003 2018-05-28 19:34:20 This coconut oil better do wonders for my face period

2019 2018-05-28 19:32:54 The 1 true thing Edwardes said. 1980 to the CBI Conference in which he said, "If the Cabinet do not have the wit and imagination to reconcile our industrial needs with the fact of North Sea oil, they would do better to leave the bloody stuff in the ground." How right that was.

2022 2018-05-28 19:32:09 As long as the oil or whatever is above self-combusting temperature it will light up if it there is O2. Only cooling down will stop it. Overheating is always dangerous.

2027 2018-05-28 19:31:53 That’s still not proof of thousands of litres! Are you really just making this up to justify dumping more into the ocean... so we can get into the business if selling oil to Asia?
2028 2018-05-28 19:31:51 —until Anna left the chambers before entering, eyeing the tin tub and the milk inside as if he was about to be put in boiling oil.

2034 2018-05-28 19:30:57 Hello, if you have some broccoli in your fridge right now, I thoroughly recommend roasting it in some olive oil with lemon zest, chilli and garlic. Then giving it a good spritz of lemon juice when it's done.
2035 2018-05-28 19:30:56 It seems the consensus is im wrong on this. Fyi, I was just trying to think outside the box on this.
2036 2018-05-28 19:30:52 Okay but I use olive oil mayo so it should be healthier... especially if we pair our food w a little cardio
2037 2018-05-28 19:30:50 CBD oil is a freaking godsend!

2041 2018-05-28 19:29:59 Sirji what about unemployment and diesel patrol rate in NagpurRs 86.75 even crude oil rate below then 75 dollar
2042 2018-05-28 19:29:50 Dismissing spills is not winning any support. People have lived to see the consequences of oil greed for too long. Places remain devastated by the impacts of spills decades after they happen. I think all sides could have done a much better job managing this.
2043 2018-05-28 19:29:49 Russia loves and needs higher oil prices. That’s why 45 really backed out of the deal.
2044 2018-05-28 19:29:48 Great to know I'm not the only person to read more than an articles headline.
100 litres of oil goes down a restaurants sink every few days.
Not concerning.
2045 2018-05-28 19:29:47 On the side note i really should stock up tea tree oil because i am down to my last bottle

2047 2018-05-28 19:29:36 #NTVNEWS Is this delay a problem? As far as I can see, the chief beneficiaries of our oil will be the foreign oil majors and their foreign supply chain. Of the $3b spent in exploration, 26% went to UG based companies (few of which are owned by UG citizens). We gain nothing.
2048 2018-05-28 19:29:32 Jis furnes oil se nizam chalta hai wo ministers pee gaye hen isliye Load Shedding to honi hai.    @javerias @ShkhRasheed
2049 2018-05-28 19:29:21 Since President Trump announced that the U.S. would pull out of the bad Iranian deal, oil prices have fallen 6%, while gas prices have increased 6%. While pushing for ever higher taxes on gas, Democrats are blaming the president (who else?) for the gas price hikes. Dishonest!
2050 2018-05-28 19:29:20 It must be a day ending in "y" on @CNN. FIFY.
2051 2018-05-28 19:29:11 Oil prices hit highest level in over three years last week, and strategists were marveling that prices had shot up so quickly. Now prices are slumping.
US crude oil futures have dropped 10% to $66.50 a barrel from £73. How quickly will they drop at UK Pumps?#rippedoffatthepumps
2052 2018-05-28 19:29:09 There’s another question that needs to be answer: what is the direct emissions of big oil versus emissions from other sources such as natural as well as all those of the general public. Are not the general public also responsible for carbon emissions when they use carbon products
2053 2018-05-28 19:28:50 Next scandal will be the oil scandal months after Uhuru Kenyatta flags off crude oil tanks in Turkana en route Mombasa for refining. A scandal in waiting! #NameTheRealNYSThieves
2054 2018-05-28 19:28:44 Total failure of #digitalindia , Indian Oil fleet card server down from last 12 hrs, No payment can be made by card at fuel station,Lots of truck stuck on road for non payment for fuel by card. Driver not carrying cash for fuel payment. First improve your IT server .
2055 2018-05-28 19:28:36 @realDonaldTrump Screw that nonsensical BS! When Obama was in office The US was to be independent from Saudi oil. It was only until Trump got an office to where poor decisions were being made and put ourselves back in the pocket Of the Saudi’s
2056 2018-05-28 19:28:26 @Dorwest are the best, we also have a squirt of salmon oil on our food.
2057 2018-05-28 19:28:18 I love this numbing feeling of tea tree oil
2058 2018-05-28 19:28:11 Machines don’t get tired they just get an oil change... @KingJames
2059 2018-05-28 19:28:01 Also coconut oil is not a damn moisturizer, it’s a sealant.
2060 2018-05-28 19:27:54 Yes, when a cargo ship spills bunker fuel it’s concentrated in one spot. Also, bunker oil is nasty stuff! 

There are literally tens of thousands of storm outlets around the GVRD, it all ends up in the ocean. Just cause you can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not there... sheesh!
2061 2018-05-28 19:27:52 I would prefer it to be the united States (small "u").
2062 2018-05-28 19:27:48 When I'm angry I eat plantain with engine oil. What about you?
2063 2018-05-28 19:27:43 get on the next flight then, while the oil's still hot.
2064 2018-05-28 19:27:34 A few wild-life paintings I've done recently and are for sale. Oil on canvas. Message me for details if your interested.
2065 2018-05-28 19:27:16 They don’t understand it’s Cooking oil lol
2066 2018-05-28 19:27:05 You don’t get it do you , you & your empty plastic oil club
2067 2018-05-28 19:26:59 To the guy with the peppermint oil on the bus. Thank you. Rainy people can smell like wet dogs lol
2068 2018-05-28 19:26:58 They want to give up nothing and take everything. Their can be no compromise that way. When I ask that question, they lie, mostly. Never rethink anything. In my experience.
2069 2018-05-28 19:26:49 My understanding is Hansch wasn’t fired as he has already been hired by an NHL team to be an amateur scout and will stay on with the Oil Kings until July 1st in order to help with the transition.
2070 2018-05-28 19:26:43 Physics and health (especially, mental health) were never here strong suits.
2071 2018-05-28 19:26:35 Get you a woman who will pause Southern Charm on Bravo so she can read about crude oil in Saudi Arabia. 

(Me. I just did that.)
2072 2018-05-28 19:26:08 How the hell is no journalist talking of the serious reductions in oil subsidy saving lacs of crores of tax payers money? A full picture would be a better way to judge the narrative!!
2073 2018-05-28 19:26:07 Please RT. If your looking to do a post-doc on the role of dilbit & crude oil in the oceans - message me about a @LiberEroFellows application - due Nov. 1.
2074 2018-05-28 19:25:48 I thought the exact same thing  1 egg 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil , leave in for 40-60 minutes 
2075 2018-05-28 19:25:41 Pan fried with some vegetable oil?
2076 2018-05-28 19:25:39 So what... they have been there for many decades... It's very normal to store oil in oil tanks.... you likely have a mini one in your car.
2077 2018-05-28 19:25:36 Let's throw in some motor oil for good measure
2078 2018-05-28 19:25:29 Living on purpose for the Lord, keeps us free from fear and full of His supernatural power. So let's make a daily decision, to be like the five virgins spoken of in Matthew 25, where they had oil enough to top up their lamps and join the bridegroom for the marriage feast.
2079 2018-05-28 19:25:20 Sometimes being a Yorkshire vegan means charging up an old phone because you might have written down the name of a chip that cooks in veg oil not dripping. #veganproblems
2080 2018-05-28 19:25:15 The other downside is using rail to transport oil which could be transporting our grain instead
2081 2018-05-28 19:25:09 While you have the extensions idk but when you remove them you can mix castor oil with almond oil and apply it every night! They will grow and become very strong 
2082 2018-05-28 19:25:05 CBD Oil is really outchea saving people's lives and giving people their lives back. amazing
2083 2018-05-28 19:25:03 Stage of grooming: using zinc and caster oil nappy rash cream as a face wash, because it’s there. Rinsed off using the leftover water in the baby bath, because it’s also there.
2084 2018-05-28 19:24:55 Exactly, Jonathan. At the rate newly middle class Chinese are buying cars oil could easily be $200/bbl or higher by 2030.  Toss in the growing Indian economy for good measure.
2085 2018-05-28 19:24:46 Toh ki bar mu to appreciate Yan mata ma su sa hoton su
2086 2018-05-28 19:24:30 The oil of gladness is upon us!
2087 2018-05-28 19:24:14 Sorry about that.
I hate making a comment & then just walking away.
Oil, pepper, garlic & garlic salt; oven at 500 for 7 minutes per pound & then turn off oven & let it alone for 2 hours.
I'll read the thread you posted & then give you my thoughts.
2088 2018-05-28 19:23:54 Great!!!! Needs to be done
2089 2018-05-28 19:23:50 Yang eversoft tu cleansing oil ke pah ?
2090 2018-05-28 19:23:46 It's called greedy money making company's and greedy government fuel prices went up 2 p today yet oil prices fell it goes up the same hour it's mentioned but when ask why it takes so long to come down we are told we buy 3months in advance if that's the case the same applies
2091 2018-05-28 19:23:46 Thank you, sir, for helping do what you can to ease the results of the increased oil prices. It is very hard on us lower-income people to bear the costs of increased gasoline and elevated prices of things we purchase due to increase of shipping costs.
2092 2018-05-28 19:23:37 Gotta slice and salt well ahead but it's pretty good grilled with olive oil. Still ends up mostly mush which people aren't a fan of.
2093 2018-05-28 19:23:34 Crude Oil : 3M barrels to ONGC and 8M barrels to Reliance - tenders expected to be shipped to India from US by mid/end of June
2094 2018-05-28 19:23:33 Just found out @jamieoliver now wants to stop dominos 2-4-1. The blokes a prick. Slurping on about fast food with not a mention of excess calories making fat people fat. Him and all the obese people should be put on an island with abit lettuce and olive oil.
2095 2018-05-28 19:23:24 I listened to tweeter and tried coconut oil n made me break out
2096 2018-05-28 19:23:17 There is no time, oil up and hit the gym with me
2097 2018-05-28 19:23:04 Economy is not magic, we simply lacked the cushion to withstand oil slump. All those "grammar" about policy direction from Madam Oby is simply theoretical noise. She cited Angola as an example, Angola fell head long into recession. Egypt is still at the brink of recession
2098 2018-05-28 19:22:52 Word when I first started doing my wash n go I was using a leave in a cream oil and then gel now I just use a Shea Moisture Low Porosity Detangler n Gel

2101 2018-05-28 19:22:33 Rob...it isnt 100L oil spill it is 100000 millilitres ....far worse
2102 2018-05-28 19:21:49 Not just oil but to save the Petro dollar. Iraq was moving to euros. Many countries are leaving the dollar now. Be prepared for more wars.
2103 2018-05-28 19:21:39 He’res my skin care secret

I put baby oil on my inner arm just bellow my arm pit so that my skin glides freely when I swing my arms
2104 2018-05-28 19:21:37 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
2105 2018-05-28 19:21:33 We are not $2 billion bailout gullible. Also be mindful when WTI benchmark oil goes up that's only about $.65 cents on the dollar for dilbit due to Discount Rate, in addition the overhead cost of the necessary  diluent mix to create dilbit also goes up. Only Texas makes KM profit
2106 2018-05-28 19:21:32 Oil prices always go up on Memorial Day. And we’ll see ya again on July 4th.
2107 2018-05-28 19:21:28 Aqui no Brasil também é feriado... No Oil Day..

2110 2018-05-28 19:21:11 Jared himself built all those models and tested them... Oh and Cambridge Analytica is total snake oil but Bob Mercer (a proven genius) just wastes his money on them. The press falling for these absurd narratives is mindblowing and sad.
2111 2018-05-28 19:21:08 Sigh. Firstly, estimates aren't bad if you have a known confidence interval. Secondly, GERS shows geographic share of oil. Thirdly, you won't have all the levers under sterlingization.
2112 2018-05-28 19:21:05 Itna writeup ho chuka hai on oil deregulation. Koi anpadh bole to theek hai..aap kaise aise bol sakte ho. Pata hai u dislike bjp namo n rightists but kam se kam apne learned hone ke tag ko barkaraar rakho. The choice of excise is govt n they wud face votes. Ask states to reduce.
2113 2018-05-28 19:21:03 Just shows how willfully blind and negligent the system is. It is failing if the assumption currently is that it is safe or responsible to have 100 L of oil of unknown composition seeping into the environment at random places.
2114 2018-05-28 19:21:02 yes i agree, but will not happen venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world apparently so no surprise here the #US is trying to control this country.
2115 2018-05-28 19:20:48 Humans have infinite capacity for appearing to be stupid. A well that never runs dry.
2116 2018-05-28 19:20:43 I won't 
instead imma roast nicki minaj
Her ass has so much plastic in it
she sweats Oil from it
2117 2018-05-28 19:20:39 Oil prices should be going down soon  (word from CNN)
2118 2018-05-28 19:20:24 You poor thing, you have my sympathies. I’m a walking buffet for the blighters & end up with awful reactions to them. The Avon oil helps me getting bitten & savlon itch gel stuff helps when I’ve been bitten (a yellow & blue tube)
2119 2018-05-28 19:20:23 What's the pattern of change? Is it more oily in warmer months, and dry in colder months? That's an easy fix, just like having a winter/summer foundation, swap out when needed. It could also be that you're not using a consistent cleanser to maintain the oil balance
2120 2018-05-28 19:20:18 Happy Memorial Day. Get rid of the oligarchy and stop going to war for oil and assassinating democratically elected leaders all over the world.
2121 2018-05-28 19:20:17 As part of a hazing ritual, Darrell Issa decides not to tell President Trump that feminist lawyers are drilling for oil. Pat Buchanan collects dust.
2122 2018-05-28 19:20:10 I work in the oil industry in a senior management level planning and executing wells from rig preparation to first oil. 

And your oil field experience is getting stung by stinging nettles lol
2123 2018-05-28 19:20:08 It's amazing how many in LSE on an oily BB say they are in the oil business. It's like peeps at a dinner party talking about the army. There's always one says he was in the SAS!
2124 2018-05-28 19:20:03 Wrong--that's actually due to plunging oil prices and a flight to safety in the US dollar due to troubles in Europe (notably Italy).
2125 2018-05-28 19:19:52 Cbd oil?
2126 2018-05-28 19:19:47 Last night I put blessed oil on my daughters’ heads, the doors & windows of my house. I usually do it the first of the year, middle of the year & at the end. I prayed over my children & our home!  #GoodVibesOnly #WeAreHavingABeautifulYear
2127 2018-05-28 19:19:44 Natural hair YouTube cancelled coconut oil a year ago and now the holy grail eco styler? 
2128 2018-05-28 19:19:25 Y’all females put a whole bunch of oil on yah face then try and say you “sun kissed” , nahhh baby , you just oily . 
2129 2018-05-28 19:19:16 I had to come to the car dealership to get and oil change, and I was just hoping and praying my crush was up here working.
2130 2018-05-28 19:19:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2131 2018-05-28 19:19:15 Tough day for good Oil Kings people: Steve Hamilton, Ryan Marsh, Randy Hansch let go. Hansch may catch on with Eastern-based NHL team as Western amateur scout. Hamilton and Marsh should be working somewhere else in WHL. Smart guys, but couldn't squeeze off. out team with none.
2132 2018-05-28 19:19:02 I was but twitter told me coconut oil is bad smh
2133 2018-05-28 19:18:55 Texas Big Oil avoids paying taxes here. Why would they? They have no vested interest in our country other than to maximize the exploitation of our natural resources.
2134 2018-05-28 19:18:54 Guess what industry is responsible for almost every component in electric vehicles? Come on, you can say it......the petrochemical industry. Without oil, gas and coal our civilization would crumble.
2135 2018-05-28 19:18:48 'Recipe for a sprain' seems to include Oil of worms & oil of swallows??? #readingitwrong
2136 2018-05-28 19:18:44 2 eggs on 2 hashbrowns on 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, baby spinach, filipino fish sauce, orange flavored cranberries, 3 oz smoked salmon
2137 2018-05-28 19:18:38 I take CBD oil. It helps with my anxiety!
2138 2018-05-28 19:18:33 I see Democrats in the pocket of Big Oil in that photo op. Just sayin’
2139 2018-05-28 19:18:33 The three-year deal is an expansion of the Saudi national oil company’s efforts to produce more natural gas to support its growing chemical industry.
2140 2018-05-28 19:18:33 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
2141 2018-05-28 19:18:30 寝ろ
2142 2018-05-28 19:18:24 This article starts with a lie, then continues. BL declined due to poor management. Not helped by the oil crisis, and the subsequent 3 day working week. Lord Stokes was essentially a salesman,  never really got to grips with the scale and politics of British Leyland,
2143 2018-05-28 19:18:12 オッヤスミーーーーーーー！！！！！！

2146 2018-05-28 19:17:57 SL is a peaceful place. Somalia cannot even unite Xamar. It's states are constantly arguing with each other and the FGS is a paper govt which derives it's legitimacy from foreign powers. America only recognises it because it has an agreement with them to honour oil deals.
2147 2018-05-28 19:17:43 On the bright side, we have three good primary canditates looking to unseat Tim Kaine.

Nick Freitas
Corey Stewart
E.W. Jackson

All three have made afirming statements with regards to preserving the Second Amendment.
2148 2018-05-28 19:17:31 What Buhari did with NNPC is using the NNPC GMD as a conduit to enrich his cronies and his region while masquarding as the incorruptible oil minister bypassing the minister of state who should naturally be in control while executing the father of all heists in the oil sector.
2149 2018-05-28 19:17:25 Good luck! Midgies are evil! Tip, Avon skin so soft oil is a good midgie deterrent 
2150 2018-05-28 19:17:24 Try Bentonite clay mixed with water and tea tree oil
2151 2018-05-28 19:17:18 And Steve Ogrizovic. He was no oil painting!
2152 2018-05-28 19:17:16 Low trading volumes on account of US, UK holiday but #oil benchmarks still sliding. #WTI (-2.08%) at $66.47/bbl, #Brent (-1.49%) at $75.30/bbl #OOTT #oilandgas
2153 2018-05-28 19:17:13 That was for your benefit...I actually work in the oil industry...what do you do again except for hiding in bushes?!?!
2154 2018-05-28 19:17:10 Just to throw some oil in the fire: many women will regret having babies too. Or succumbing to someone's pressure and not having an abortion.
2155 2018-05-28 19:17:07 Chef Gusteau cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with gravy.
2156 2018-05-28 19:17:03 Before your misplaced pride explodes have a look at the conclusions of these conflicts
Afghanistan, heroine trade,
Iraq arms trade,
Syria oil trade,
DEATHS TO CIVILIANS 3M+ and rising,who benefits from these conflicts,not the soldier not the US citizen,but drug lords&arms dealers
2157 2018-05-28 19:17:00 Also .. I've heard incredible success stories about CBD oil for seizures. Something else to look into mañana.
2158 2018-05-28 19:16:48 O/N Wrap:
Three day weekends for US and UK places further focus on Europe and failed Italian elections - equities and #EUR both lower; oil extends sell-off; #NZD nudges higher on thin volumes.
2159 2018-05-28 19:16:43 why can’t you just use coconut oil & shea butter like the rest of us?
2160 2018-05-28 19:16:41 I don’t think the word “rig” has been used this much since the Rockefeller Era with oil smh lol
2161 2018-05-28 19:16:37 Rick, one thing I’ve learned is that people honestly don’t realize oil spills can be cleaned up. They think that when oil spills it permanently damages the land for years/decades/centuries. Some media attention on cleanup technologies would be really helpful.
2162 2018-05-28 19:16:35 The question in the poll relates specifically to the pipeline, nothing about shipping oil by oil tanker through BC’s coast.
2163 2018-05-28 19:16:35 Hello knobkopf. Are you on automatic pilot? That's nothing to do with the discussion. Now piss off and immerse yourself in some boiling oil
2164 2018-05-28 19:16:25 Personally I’m with Michael Moore and his theory about the oil pipeline through Afghanistan. Compared to the revenue that generates with what the CIA could take and use from the drug trade, it’s insignificant
2165 2018-05-28 19:16:13 Gotta get this oil change soon
2166 2018-05-28 19:15:45 I vape flower in it, that’s why I got it. Always been more of a weed than oil girl. I think you can put whatever concentrate you want if you get that add on for it.

2168 2018-05-28 19:15:33 Today is the last day of PTI government. Let's revisit their performance of 5 years:

1_BRT.
2_Zoo.
3_Swat motorway.
4-Peshawar Heritage Trail.
5_Karak oil refinery (project in pipeline).
6_Reforms in health sector
7_Reforms in Police
8_Reforms in education sector
2169 2018-05-28 19:15:32 Trains don’t travel to Asia, oil tankers do... loaded down with 650 000 barrels of toxic and flammable substance passing through one of North America’s most densely populated cities!

Why do you support transforming Vancouver into a major oil exporting port? What’s in it 4 U?
2170 2018-05-28 19:15:32 Dam why people always fight when they drink  fucking oil bro
2171 2018-05-28 19:15:23 Total chaos in Brazil due to the Petrobras mess.

We shouldn't be a hostage of oil/fuel.

When will the social redemption so expected by the Brazilians happen?

Unfortunately, bad politicians profit massively from such an economic imbalance.
2172 2018-05-28 19:15:19 for the sore throat gargle warm salt water. then make a hotty toddy. for the chest congestion you can steam your face w/ a rag and essential oil or take an acv shot w/ water
2173 2018-05-28 19:15:17 it’s just facts! all it does is take cakeyness away, and sometimes they increase oil throughout the day
2174 2018-05-28 19:15:16 The Liberals ran on a platform to invest in environment &economy. I don’t know where people thought no pipelines would be built.Currently we are getting reduced price for our oil from US.Libs have invested in Oceans protection& better response The $ be used to transition to green
2175 2018-05-28 19:15:06 Nope not in Glasgow! It’s still coconut oil weather!
2176 2018-05-28 19:15:00 How will the oil spill effect the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline? @crudereporter explains.
2177 2018-05-28 19:14:57 its been doing fine for my skin and actually alleviated my acne more than it aggravated it for the brief period of time that i primarily used coconut oil. but since ive been using charcoal too its been fine for me. I think it just depends on each person's skin, as most oils do
2178 2018-05-28 19:14:49 And the sainted Andrew Wilson said in the clearest of terms that oil shouldn’t be ‘baked into’ a ref prospectus as it had been in 2013.
2179 2018-05-28 19:14:48 #TheQueenMzansi Mmabatho says Shaka and Church are like oil and water.
2180 2018-05-28 19:14:39 Biggest oil reserves in Europe, biggest nuclear arsenal in Europe, most strategic coastline in northern Europe. Course the EU wont speak with Scotland....
2181 2018-05-28 19:14:35 I have asked the same question and wondered the same thing for years. Gas rises when oil goes up.  But it never falls at the same rate. Been getting gouged since oil hit 150 and started to fall.
2182 2018-05-28 19:14:33 Fortunately, there's a long way to go. If Trump can clean house with the Federal Gov. We can turn this around, all the lib gov workers that live in NoVA.
2183 2018-05-28 19:14:23 i got a sample of the Sunday Riley Luna Oil and I'm so excited to try it out without spending $100 on it.
2184 2018-05-28 19:14:07 Haha. How do you know? Wise up and take your oil
2185 2018-05-28 19:13:55 DNA tests can't test for ethnicity. They only test for genetic markers and compare them to really small data sets of people. Its highly unsound, not credible and doesn't pass scientific standards. I bet the door to door snake oil salesman does great at your house. 
2186 2018-05-28 19:13:41 Wondering why Netflix has such a hard on for Gillian Jacobs she constantly look like she didn’t take off her mascara from the night before and has been oil training her hair for a month
2187 2018-05-28 19:13:32 tara may dala kaming mi nola oil
2188 2018-05-28 19:13:30 And back when oil taxation revenue was high we didn't argue about the validity of GERS, we argued about the danger of basing an economy on a volatile commodity—something which became apparent shortly afterwards.
2189 2018-05-28 19:13:15 How much oil naturally seeps to surface? Surely a lot more than this spillover.
2190 2018-05-28 19:13:15 Can you use lavender essential oil as lube? Asking for a friend.
2191 2018-05-28 19:13:12 Never miss a chance to see the only guy that might like olive oil more than I do! #alittledrizzle

2196 2018-05-28 19:12:45 U americans love following the scent of those oil rich nations,did that not get ye in trouble all over the world,i suppose follow the money and jump on the bandwagon YNWA
2197 2018-05-28 19:12:35 She's busy right now. 
Writing a piece on organ harvesting of migrants by Trump. Ronnie Jackson was ringleader, real reason for resignation.
2198 2018-05-28 19:12:34 Until you succeed in banning oil exploration & production, you should stop micro-managing these businesses
2199 2018-05-28 19:12:30 That Is what you people think, KY dena kafirta mutum, bakusan Aikin alherin daya keyi baa, amma ji cigaba, zunde, yafice, duk Babu kyau.

2201 2018-05-28 19:12:14 The three-year deal is an expansion of the Saudi national oil company’s efforts to produce more natural gas to support its growing chemical industry.

#IfYouknowYouKnow
2203 2018-05-28 19:12:07 I tried the protini polypeptide cream yesterday. It was like a soft cloud on my face! I could only afford the shaba complex eye serum this season. Maybe I'll wait till the holiday sale for the face oil...!
2204 2018-05-28 19:12:05 Oil paints are fun and games until you're waiting 4 hours for it to dry
2205 2018-05-28 19:11:38 The coconut oil hair..okay
2206 2018-05-28 19:11:34 That’s sadly not true, the only reason countries need to focus on renewable energy is so those countries that sell oil, (OPEC, Russia, US) can’t use it as a political tool to pressure the countries that buy oil & gas to survive cold winters, can’t be forced to comply.
2207 2018-05-28 19:11:26 A glorious, sweaty, Motor oil soaked sponge... well myn right now anyways lmao!
2208 2018-05-28 19:11:22 Android phone, not much choice without taking up extra spaces and half the shit not working because google owns everything and requires an account with them to use.
2209 2018-05-28 19:11:17 Normally my momma keeps the dougb dipped in oil overnight, around 5-6 hours.
2210 2018-05-28 19:11:06 Atomic Messengers
Imagine if scientists were able to attach normal particles to photons, on the molecular level, so that we can send materials, one atom at a time, at the speed of light. Like how soap molecules are able to grab on to oil on one end and water on the other.
2211 2018-05-28 19:11:03 I recommend olbas oil for stinking colds if for no other reason than that the wee bottle I just replaced lasted approximately all my life to date, I mean I'm pretty sure I blagged it off my folks when I moved up to Glasgow for uni
2212 2018-05-28 19:10:58 Zero Emission Revolution Could Wipe Out $21 Trillion In #Oil Revenue
2213 2018-05-28 19:10:55 They were inspected regularly and honored the agreement. Trump just wanted to drive up oil prices.
2214 2018-05-28 19:10:49 
2215 2018-05-28 19:10:49 If you have acne and want to go the natural route of treating it skip the coconut oil and rose water bullshit Skincare Twitter tells you to use and use tea tree & neem oil and take vitamin C or find a vitamin C serum and take zinc and vitamins that promote kidney function.
2216 2018-05-28 19:10:36 Me: literally has skin cancer
Me: drowns self in tanning oil and lays in 95° weather for 48 hours
2217 2018-05-28 19:10:34 I’m talking about solid coconut oil and don’t just assume everybody gets they’re intel from “viral tweets”
2218 2018-05-28 19:10:33 no Hamish don't go. ...you can do it. If Heid can you can.
Just tell @Adrianwfire that you like The Beatles. 
His a pussy cat really
2219 2018-05-28 19:10:33 is this palm oil
2220 2018-05-28 19:10:32 Less than a barrel of oil and nome of it was released to any water ways. Nice try loser.
2221 2018-05-28 19:10:25 Iran illegal dealers have amassed huge clients during previous sanctions years, USA has found oil reserves too now.
So lesser oil is just media campaign
2222 2018-05-28 19:10:20 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
2223 2018-05-28 19:10:11 The three-year deal is an expansion of the Saudi national oil company’s efforts to produce more natural gas to support its growing chemical industry.

2229 2018-05-28 19:09:23 @laurencheriie My french family goes back to 1333 NW, now I live in the SE. Arabs don't belong here, but western technology babifies the world and leaves the world ignorant, and us receptive. It's not a war zone;) here, save for old oil wars of our governments.
2230 2018-05-28 19:09:22 Where do you see it in the ocean Andrew? Where’s the oil slick? You’re the one suggesting THOUSANDS of litres are entering the ocean! Prove it!

But when a cargo ship spills bunker oil that’s quite easy to see huh?
2231 2018-05-28 19:09:17 Apparently because a previous administration screwed up, no one is allowed to care about their kids ever again.

(How loving a parent are you if you let your kids travel alone through several South American countries anyway?)
2232 2018-05-28 19:09:01 Are you trying to tell us rUK doesn't need our oil, oil derivitives, electricity, water, food and drink? On yer bike mate.
2233 2018-05-28 19:09:01 In the 19th century if you were making outlandish false claims about your product you would be labled a snake oil peddler and subsequently be tarred&feathered. When advertising laws we passed it brought attention to adertising as a whole.
2234 2018-05-28 19:09:00 But I oppose the line for the broader reason of us not having a proper Western Cdn Energy Plan in place that includes a clearly defined Renewables strategy and an oil Conservation Plan such as reducing single use plastics & promoting EVs.
2235 2018-05-28 19:08:59 Probably not at all. But aid comes at a cost. If USA is so benevolent, why charge us for the aid with interest?

My city was nearly levelled by German bombs. Prescott Bush (father of G. Bush) was charged under 'trading with the enemy act' selling oil to the Luftwaffe.
2236 2018-05-28 19:08:54 300g strong white flour, tsp salt, 7g yeast and 200mls of Sharps Atlantic ale and a glug of olive oil... follow a basic dough recipe and just swap water for ale! Eat responsibly 
2237 2018-05-28 19:08:39 So my chiefs, from beer to oil cup....against Sundowns...@Soccerzone4sho
2238 2018-05-28 19:08:10 Sharing half knowledge is as good as Misguiding. Why don’t you speak about loan indian took for Iran oil & how oil companies bleed during MMS time & how the loans are repaid by NM.
2239 2018-05-28 19:08:08 What pisses me off?...politicians misuse of military forces in illegal oil & geopolitical wars...not to mention special forces directing terrorist organizations to overthrow govts not compliant to western policy & banking ,bowing to the dollar!!..Libya & now Syria...i'm upset 
2240 2018-05-28 19:07:58 I don’t understand the poorest among us are democrats, all the while the democrats are pushing illegal and legal immigration that depresses the wages of the poorest among us! Look what happened in the Dakotas when drilling for oil caused labor shortage, Fast-food workers $20 hr.
2241 2018-05-28 19:07:57 The war of @tukaraq is not a war between @somaliland and @Puntland but it is a war between @Norwey oil company and @sweden oil company in @Hol-hol town @sanag region.
2242 2018-05-28 19:07:55 2) run-of-the-mill pol, he isn’t owned by lobbyists, etc. he has no “war for oil” agenda, his actions have only proven that he only wants to accomplish what is RIGHT FOR AMERICA AND FOR THE PEACE OF THE WORLD.  And yet, in the last few months, they keep taking a “SHILL” stance...
2243 2018-05-28 19:07:53 Things to dip french fries in:
1) Ketchup
2) Mayo
3) The ocean
4) The oil filler of your car
2244 2018-05-28 19:07:51 3. Carbon leakage refers to increased C emissions elsewhere due to AB oil exports. Not AB's problem. Other jurisdictions have their own climate change policies. 
4. There is nothing "lefty" about this.
2245 2018-05-28 19:07:48 I wouldn't, personally, no. If the engine's regularly serviced there shouldn't be any issues. If it's a bit filthy, a series of changes with cheap oil should help. Modem oils have detergents in them anyway. Had one engine develop a tap following a flush (by a dealer)...

2252 2018-05-28 19:07:09 Isn't it awesome.  Dying for gold, oil and drugs.
2253 2018-05-28 19:06:39 stopped at VIVI market today got tahini sauce, siracha sauce, mango pickle and sesame oil! bring on summer
2254 2018-05-28 19:06:38 And I read today that OPEC, led by the Saudis, will be ramping up oil production. The PPB immediately dropped to $66. AB pols can blame Trudeau (dead & living), NDP, the East but as always we are at mercy of the global market.
2255 2018-05-28 19:06:03 I’m using an oil based nipple cream but yeah I use it every time. They aren’t dry or cracking but theyre super tender and as soon as he latched I have to hold my breath for a minute haha
2256 2018-05-28 19:05:49 Congrats! The one time I made it, I found it easier than I expected (with the help of a blender) ...just required a touch of patience and a steady hand to drizzle the oil in slowly and evenly.

2258 2018-05-28 19:05:47 I’ve been using the vitamin E products for three years and the shea and honey body scrub and your tea tree oil & face masks oh and Japanese tea great products!!!
2259 2018-05-28 19:05:42 Michael Gove is as green as crude oil. Nothing to stop UK government creating green parks if they wanted. Reality is open spaces neglected because of Tory austerity.
2260 2018-05-28 19:05:12 hahaha It's not just Sephora -- it's actually clothing/make-up and home decor.

But my Sephora basket is priority right now because I need new highlighter and I want to try a $90 face oil by Drunk Elephant lol
2261 2018-05-28 19:05:11 Democrats should concentrate on fusion rather than try to restrict the will of the people.  Oil is best utilized for other purposes, but we have plenty for centuries.  @cspanwj #PJNET #TCOT #P2
2262 2018-05-28 19:04:58 Is baby oil ever used for babies anymore?  #deepthoughts
2263 2018-05-28 19:04:53 The reason we are in so many wars is because there is oil dripping down the political spectrum's chin
2264 2018-05-28 19:04:51 Norway has made a mint from North Sea oil where as we spent it on the miners strike and unemployment benefit.

2266 2018-05-28 19:04:47 Chavez used OIL as a crutch to try and re-ignite a failing system of
government. He's not giving - he's appeasing them. Do you actually
believe a dictator is so generous with billions?
2267 2018-05-28 19:04:43 8pm and I’m still in my garden semi-naked, lathered in tanning oil 
2268 2018-05-28 19:04:42 I'm pretty sure I had a few drinks before watching it. It was still a struggle to get through it.
2269 2018-05-28 19:04:42 Why do we need so many wars and lose so many people, simply out of greed? Remember when your fearless leader said we should have taken the oil?  Too many wars.  I am tired of losing my brothers and sisters to fill the coffers of Autocrats.
2270 2018-05-28 19:04:40 The real story is that the ruling party impoverished the elderly by wiping out pensions through economic mismanagement & hyper-inflation, it is a tragedy of epic proportions ... and you choose instead to talk about the donation of some rice and cooking oil? @buildzimbabwe
2271 2018-05-28 19:04:35 Haven't people realised yet, especially after this past 2 yrs or so, that politicians both sides of the aisle are overwhelming 'there' for power, money & prestige.  Never following through on campaign promises & they are not there for the people.  Politicians = snake oil salesmen
2272 2018-05-28 19:04:34 So? The media's motives in what they choose to report is also suspect. In this country the media's agenda is the same as their big pharma big oil sponsors. Everyone has an agenda. Officials/media are suppressing the story in order to protect themselves not the girls.
2273 2018-05-28 19:04:32 How's your investment with Philex Oil nga pala?

2275 2018-05-28 19:04:14 Ok so sell me a pax. It’s like 200 dollars and then what. I buy oil at what cost.
2276 2018-05-28 19:04:05 The only solvents we use to make our oils are water and the carrier oil.  You won't get much cheaper or sustainable production than that...

2296 2018-05-28 19:01:25 There was huge burden absorbed by oil companies during UPA rule. Who had set right the c/f anomaly?
2297 2018-05-28 19:01:24 I'm not thick. Man City were nothing without the oil money. Do you honestly believe Guardiola would be at your club without the oil money?
2298 2018-05-28 19:01:20 Investigations have revealed that 28 oil workers were still trapped on the ConOil platform in Koluama 1 community of Southern Ijaw in Bayelsa State, after it was engulfed by fire on Saturday morning. No less than 100 oil workers were confirmed rescued yesterday.

2302 2018-05-28 19:01:07 I disagree, but that is alright.  I watched Democrats vote to disallow American companies to survey gov’t land and map it for oil.  The GOP changed the law.  @cspanwj #PJNET #TCOT #P2

2304 2018-05-28 19:01:05 Per the Williston Wire: Midland, Texas officials will visit Williston to learn about how this center of the #Bakken #oil boom has handled growth.
2305 2018-05-28 19:01:01 It’s not expected from a party of two decades who doesn’t understand d govt policies. If you really want to reduce the price of oil plz withdraw VAT completely n set an example. Please don’t try to politicize n play with d emotions of common people @BJP4Odisha @dpradhanbjp

2310 2018-05-28 19:00:15 Good lord, that would be very unsafe. Why would you even suggest such an action.
2311 2018-05-28 19:00:13 I would say he was very thoughtful and saw you for the snake oil salesmen you really are. So what was your point?

2315 2018-05-28 18:59:49 Kurt was supposed to change my oil while he was home but now I just had to pay $97 for an oil change!!!! 
2316 2018-05-28 18:59:45 Totally agree. Worthless. Instead of looking ahead they are looking no further than their current support from Big Oil.
2317 2018-05-28 18:59:38 Black Seed Oil really just saved me. After this discovery, I’ll never take medicine again. 
2318 2018-05-28 18:59:33 $42.90 on a foreign car isn’t bad for a oil change  especially when it was supposed to be $76 
2319 2018-05-28 18:59:27 The Shitholer and former Sec. of State Tillerson sent these 4 brave Soldiers to Chad and Niger to protect ExxonMobil Oil.

2328 2018-05-28 18:58:39 Keyamo: Be specific. What policy are you referring to here? Give eg of countries like Nigeria that relies solely on oil, with low foreign reserves that have survived recession before?

We r still waiting for Madam Obby till now. She has been dribbling without shooting at de goal
2329 2018-05-28 18:58:32 (theres actually a sliver of science behind it - crude oil in that area has higher naptha concentration than anywhere else, and that's the same stuff that is in coal tar soap)

2337 2018-05-28 18:57:54 Can we put same energy to oil exploration in the ND ?
2338 2018-05-28 18:57:48 Price of petrol and diesel may go up and down based on international crude oil price. Media is unnecessarily creating hype to defame present govt.  Any hidden agenda?

2342 2018-05-28 18:57:15 Sounds interesting. Could you please post a thread about the petro dollar? I’d totally forgotten the term, was it actually a separate “thing” or just reflect the dollar being valued by reference to the oil price because the US controlled so much oil?

2353 2018-05-28 18:55:46 Unemployment & economy following same path it's been on since 2009. It is projected that the tax cut for the rich & big corporations will increase debt by trillions and trigger recession. You know what historically happens when oil/gas prices increase? Recession. Double whammy.
2354 2018-05-28 18:55:41 Trump Snake Oil Salesman. 

Too bad he doesn't have to be truthful about the side effects.
2355 2018-05-28 18:55:40 As a basic position, I generally favour respecting autonomy. There are times when it's right to overrule that if allowing autonomy results in more harm than good. To use an unrelated hypothetical, I would stop people from dumping oil or waste because it would cause more harm ...
2356 2018-05-28 18:55:23 India says no plans for oil trade with Venezuela using 'petro' crypto currency.
2357 2018-05-28 18:55:23 in ontario 100 litres or less of transport oil or fuel on or near a roadway is non reportable.

2363 2018-05-28 18:54:37 to die for oil **
2364 2018-05-28 18:54:34 i’ve been told the U.S. got into a fight with Syria (main oil exporter), so now we aren’t receiving as much oil as Syria’s retaliation. So the prices should keep going up to reach over $3.00 by the end of summer
2365 2018-05-28 18:54:32 Aku rasa la i can see my scar fading away, yg scar from jerawat kecik kecik atas dahi, but the problem is aku taktau is it bc of oil tuuu or sebab aku constantly pakai mosturizer toner everyday(sbb before ni aku malas nak jaga everyday)
2366 2018-05-28 18:54:27 So all that oil, fuel, grease from cars on the pavement goes where when it rains?
2367 2018-05-28 18:54:25 Classless move by thompson to admit lebron does drugs. Everyone knows oil changes are the only way to pass a drug test
2368 2018-05-28 18:54:21 If oil change is an analogy for a new team then yes
2369 2018-05-28 18:54:19 If I’m driving 22 hours I’m getting some kitty and a place to lay my head .... throw a oil change in the care package while you’re at it
2370 2018-05-28 18:53:58 Obama recently promised the Brazilians that he would be eager to buy their newfound offshore oil — while prohibiting similar such exploration here at home. From Instapundit May 28th 2018
2371 2018-05-28 18:53:51 We know. Still trying to figure out how @RepMaxineWaters  and others can keep getting reelected. One of the greatest mysteries of universe.
2372 2018-05-28 18:53:47 We have a glut of oil in the planet.  Democrats tried to make Americans think we were going to run out, but now it’s clear it won’t happen in our lives.  @cspanwj #PJNET #TCOT #P2
2373 2018-05-28 18:53:46 more oil than oil wells

2375 2018-05-28 18:53:41 put more oil well on line all across the USA.....
2376 2018-05-28 18:53:37 No reason for petrol prices to go up.   The Oil prices internationally has dropped..... But who can ask the Govt?

And is the Govt even Listening?

2378 2018-05-28 18:53:24 Privacy coins by their nature are only such if traded/exchanged by p2p.  Until such time as they have their own base pair & can be used to purchase goods directly. Ultimately govs only have to watch the in/out flow of fiat to pounce so at the moment they're kinda snake oil
2379 2018-05-28 18:53:24 America produces Oil we need to buy American Oil! Screw the Saudis! @POTUS MAKE AMERICA GREAT!

2382 2018-05-28 18:53:21 ...I wasn’t the one giving it any press!

No Andrew, thousands of litres of oil do not pour into the ocean here each time it rains or there’d be evidence of that to prove your point. That’s just more “ it’s dirty already” propaganda from Big Oil to justify more spills!
2383 2018-05-28 18:53:04 確かに最近くってない

2384 2018-05-28 18:53:04 Need oil change & tank on E..

2394 2018-05-28 18:51:53 @fkeyamo mistakes includes mentioning that recession began in 2008 (Late Yar Adua's era) when in fact, d world experienced Global Financial Crisis that affected crude oil sales.
He further erred when he said same recession began in 2014, while the world knew it began in 2016.
2395 2018-05-28 18:51:45 Sadly the young NI boy who hadn't had a seizure since given cannabis oil has been told he cannot be prescribed it anymore!  Pencil pushers!

2401 2018-05-28 18:51:29 When we visited the Arizona earlier this year, we learned about the ship’s oil drops which still slowly rise to the water’s surface every day, shimmering like tear drops for our fallen warriors.
For those who sacrificed everything for our freedom, thank you.
2402 2018-05-28 18:51:27 In similar news;

Chuckle Brothers predict oil prices will take 3 centuries to recover to pre 2008 levels.
2403 2018-05-28 18:51:27 I’m replacing all of my meals with fries and drinking the oil they are fried in
2404 2018-05-28 18:51:25 I don't see many Democrats pushing for regulations or bans on oil & gas
2405 2018-05-28 18:51:21 You know the age old saying “ divide and conquer.” The powers that be focus you against those at the border instead of on the real problem: the entitlement of the rich. Oil corps are subsidized by the govt but there’s no money for social security, food stamps? I could go on.
2406 2018-05-28 18:51:11 Oil price spiked earlier in May after Trump withdrew from the Iran deal but the price of oil per barrel has fallen since then. Keeping the price of oil down is dependent on Russia and Saudi Arabia maintaining an increased supply...
2407 2018-05-28 18:51:06 More like the BP Oil Spill
2408 2018-05-28 18:50:56 I think what im saying and what y'all are hearing are two different things. When "compromise" comes up, were the only ones giving up something. Start asking them what they are willing to give up. They'll either give you an honest answer, rethink some positions, or just lie...
2409 2018-05-28 18:50:53 Oil. Waste.

2415 2018-05-28 18:49:59 To add some flavor to your greens, sauté spinach and kale in olive oil &amp; fresh squeezed orange &amp; lemon juice. Serve with berries &amp; chicken.
2416 2018-05-28 18:49:54 They injected the oil? Intravenously?
2417 2018-05-28 18:49:51 Peppermint oil fam it works amazingly
2418 2018-05-28 18:49:26 You are so uninformed.   Oil prices are not set by our country.   They could be but we can't drill off certain coasts.   Until then it's supply and demand.     Learn this before you tweet ignorant takes
2419 2018-05-28 18:49:22 The new oil boom

2427 2018-05-28 18:48:41 Inevitable I can only see a huge artificial surface of black silicon that absorbs and retains solar radiation. It looks nothing like a forest or a meadow. They will miss the coal, oil and gas. Don't doubt that the surface of the earth will miss them .
2428 2018-05-28 18:48:36 She should try cannabis with lots of CBDs - I know several epileptic individuals who have been seizure-free since using CBD oil.
2429 2018-05-28 18:48:36 An excuse to nationalize oil
2430 2018-05-28 18:48:23 I smell like a literal flower and fruit garden wow. a mix of Lush’s easy peel (orange) & neroli & jojoba oil w dried elderflower & amaranth. ylang ylang + chamomile + lavender. rose water & lait de coco spritz. Himalayan patchouli berry cologne. just sum lite.

2434 2018-05-28 18:47:42 1-Calendula oil is a great moisturizer n helps soothe the area and reduce the pain.

3-It alsohelps relieve diaper rashes, which can  irritate an infant.

2435 2018-05-28 18:47:39 People still use oil sheen???
2436 2018-05-28 18:47:33 I've always thought that was a bit of an oxymoron.
2437 2018-05-28 18:47:32 It’s already happened. Arab Oil Embargo. It was rationed by last digit on your tag. I remember because I was the one who had to wait in inline to fill my parents car. 
2438 2018-05-28 18:47:31 Trump wants  to do deals  or go to war to get   his hands on the worlds oil suppy. This is all about  money and Trumps family greed.
2439 2018-05-28 18:47:15 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with toothpaste.
2440 2018-05-28 18:47:07 Anyone got any ideas how to get cooking oil out a top? 
2441 2018-05-28 18:47:01 Use coconut oil
2442 2018-05-28 18:46:46 Everyone wants ache din sir.
And I am certain that if we give 5 more years to the same govt then surely it will come. 
India paid the oil debt of Iran which was 6.7 billions dollars. I hope now the petrol prices will be controlled and every state will accept Petrol under GST.
2443 2018-05-28 18:46:45 I told my aunt that the founder of the essential oil company died and she dumped her glass of wine out to “pour one out for the homies”
2444 2018-05-28 18:46:45 Let me rephrase, weve got to get that ball rolling. With some it starts with small things getting them to change and opinion about this or that and then work for bigger chunks. Besides, you can only do so much to effect laws from social media. Just trying to add another tool.
2445 2018-05-28 18:46:40 That we will go to war for oil?
2446 2018-05-28 18:46:40 Alberta and B.C. could solve their gasoline problem if theLeaders had the common sense to build a large oil refinery in Alberta.
Then the refined gasoline would be of no problem for pipeline worries.

2448 2018-05-28 18:46:25 Oh hey if anyone needs any extra oil for their memorial day cooking, my forehead is available
2449 2018-05-28 18:46:22 The con men who are fishing for lonely women usually claim they are military or engineers in the oil industry and are currently overseas.

I have toyed with the last couple letting them think they have a hook. Then I tell them I'm reporting them. Boy one got pissed! Bwahahaha!
2450 2018-05-28 18:46:11 IKR?! This is an excellent share Dave! This is exactly why we exist. As a seizure paitent myself, I can't afford the risk of purchasing and using fake oil and neither should any of you.
2451 2018-05-28 18:46:10 I think if you look at who started this thread on this trivial oil spill you’ll see it was you. If it was nothing, why’d you bring it up... other than to use it as yet another platform to lobby for big oil?
2452 2018-05-28 18:46:02 Oil and Water? Even today?
2453 2018-05-28 18:45:59 "Trump says Marines are sloppy dressers."

We're lucky he's our PM! Jai Hind.
2455 2018-05-28 18:45:50 Fascination of going for broke, once more, by the british govt. 

Pre North Sea oil discovery, the uk was burst, Scotland saved the country. Tories determined to replicate that ‘skint’ trick again; be our guests - but independent Scots won’t be bailing you out this time

2459 2018-05-28 18:45:25 @TheBisonBanff looking forward to eating at your wonderful restaurant. Canola oil?  Will that be easy to avoid?  We are not fans of the stuff. Thanks!
2460 2018-05-28 18:45:18 Minute 4 of the ITV satellite disruption. Chaos has consumed all of us. Civilisation has broken down. The remaining population fight for oil and food.

2465 2018-05-28 18:43:44 Need to look at trade crossing China/North Korea in both directions. Look at Koreans crossing illegally into China, risking far more than death. Look at hidden oil transfers at sea avoiding embargo. And not last, health of nk soldier who crossed over to sk. His health said a lot
2466 2018-05-28 18:43:38 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

2471 2018-05-28 18:43:18 Love Borlotto Beans. How do you eat them? we make a salad with them after cooking, just top with olive oil and vinegar and chopped garlic. Excess beans get put in the freezer.
2472 2018-05-28 18:43:13 *makes a note* Don't inject yourself with oil sludge. 
Got it. Don't know how people remember all of this "how not to die" stuff. It's hard.

2474 2018-05-28 18:43:07 I engaged a lady who seems educated and works with an oil company in Warri today. I was shocked when she NDDC projects are oil projects & not Federal Projects, that no Federal Government Projects in Delta State. I lectured her on how our people divert NDDC projects money to Lagos

2476 2018-05-28 18:43:01 I love when the hashtag drain the swamp is used unironically. It was funny when he hired the head of a pharma company to control drug prices/oil man/hurricane Katrina girl/Bush torturer/Rosenstein/etc but after John Bolton, 
2477 2018-05-28 18:42:52 dude, you do not have a clue on global oil industry and how it works.  Stay off my timeline with opinions with no facts to back it up.
2478 2018-05-28 18:42:49 This reminds me of those gas boycotts where people were urging others not to buy gas for 2 or 3 days to stand up to big oil... i wonder how that went.... ?
2479 2018-05-28 18:42:48 Have u tried setting ur primer w powder before foundation? jackie aina taught me this and oil has been a myth to me ever since
2480 2018-05-28 18:42:46 Pipe line and one oil spill and you will never see that beach again. Think about tons of crewed oil in that harbour and you the tax payer will pay to clean it up. No way is BC have the equipment to even handle a spill like that. You people all need a wake up call. It's all BS
2481 2018-05-28 18:42:43 I've been using a homemade cleanser that's kept my skin blemish free.  

It consist of:

This cleans my skin w/o stripping it.

2485 2018-05-28 18:42:36 @asda hi there.  The news this morning reported that the price of a barrel of oil had gone down by $5 yesterday.  When can we see your pump prices reduce??!!!
2486 2018-05-28 18:42:34 Won't anyone think of the oil barrons? *waves hands weakly* 

2487 2018-05-28 18:42:23 From an outsiders perspective, this tweet smells of your self applied ego massage oil. How hateful to self promote on the back of true heroes (who actually put themselves in the line of fire)
2488 2018-05-28 18:42:19 CBD OIL IS NOT A HOAX!

2492 2018-05-28 18:42:09 It’s wrong to paint BC as anti oil. Never has BC in this process attempted to stop oil. BC went to the Supreme Court to determine its ability to restrict amount of dilbit in the event that the project pushes through. Yet currently,dilbit flows freely which is good for BC and AB

2575 2018-05-28 18:35:46 After oil price deregulation, there is no role of govt to control that. Does that really benefit the aam aadmi. If not then what is the use of such jokes.
2576 2018-05-28 18:35:42 Ummmm slice them and put in the oven with seasoning salt and olive oil. It’ll change your mind !
2577 2018-05-28 18:35:36 This is Nigeria! If Govt finds oil in ur backyard It's govt property, but if they find weed, It's yours and you're going to jail
2578 2018-05-28 18:35:24 But once a week, I wash his hair and bathe him with aveeno bath and shampoo. Then I put some Jamaican castor oil on hair especially his bald spot in the back. He sleeps so hard it begins to form and messes up his curl pattern
2579 2018-05-28 18:35:12 Indian oil prices are same like this captionalism
2580 2018-05-28 18:35:06 Biko show me. How long did you use the lavender oil for?
2581 2018-05-28 18:35:04 Convinced when it’s this hot, that it’s not tanning oil making girls shiny and it’s sweat.
2582 2018-05-28 18:35:02 It's a purple ink and then washed with Druchi Voilet, then Nuln Oil, highlighted with Lucius Lilac
2583 2018-05-28 18:34:50 popping oil from a pan hitting skin, let’s say your stomach in this random scenario, is quite uncomfortable and might dissuade you from cooking with a crop top ever again
2584 2018-05-28 18:34:50 Thought I’d share my recent discovery: Too broke for undereye creams? Rub on some olive oil before bed. I woke up with no little eye wrinkles this morning. Magiicccc! #beautytips 
2585 2018-05-28 18:34:45 Brosseau: Why are you giving billions of dollars of taxpayer money to an oil giant?

Trudeau: We spent four years in opposition ruining the perception of Canadian oil, so now we have to spend lots of money to make the pipeline work.

#cdnpoli #qp
2586 2018-05-28 18:34:43 Money should be put into Canadian refineries. Keep our oil.
2587 2018-05-28 18:34:42 Ok let me put some oil on these vocal chords. Coz this how ima get u ass
2588 2018-05-28 18:34:32 おや、お肌弱いマンですか？私と一緒だね。
こういう季節がとてもつらい
2589 2018-05-28 18:34:25 Also I’m sure that GOI is and has done such hedging and futures trading for international sales of oil (I.e by way of the IOC etc) ... I would be more and highly impress if we create goldman, ubs, bnp, jp Morgan, Deutsch banke
2590 2018-05-28 18:34:08 Because oil and vinegar or basalmic makes the bread soggy. I light spread of mayo seals it from getting soggy from the ketchup.
2591 2018-05-28 18:34:00 334
2592 2018-05-28 18:34:00 We used to use malt paste, but now our local rescue makes their own blend of oil. I think oil seeps into their fur and keeps them licking longer 
2593 2018-05-28 18:33:57 This makes me sick. It is ALL about the oil. BIBI doesn't give AF about the people. His corrupt ass is ALL about being able to loot the land.

2598 2018-05-28 18:33:00 kilode, na engine oil dey run for him blood  
2599 2018-05-28 18:32:51 Partly because there's hardly any oil taxation revenue to include; and partly because they knew they couldn't pull the "Oil is a bonus (while treating it as a basis)!" trick twice.
2600 2018-05-28 18:32:47 サラダもあるから安心安心
2601 2018-05-28 18:32:42 Its today u decided to do yours
2602 2018-05-28 18:32:37 Dear God. Make it stop!!! The unemployment rate was already trending in this trajectory when President Obama was in office and cannot be attributed to you. You are a snake oil salesman who spews half truths that only your base cares not to research.
2603 2018-05-28 18:32:29 What happend to America? The pristine America of the indians is now polluted, fracked to death. Get an opium addiction on eating mossels.
Get the taste of BP oil eating lobsters, creyfish, shrimp.
2604 2018-05-28 18:32:27 The secret of their beauty: Fish and olive oil!
2605 2018-05-28 18:32:22 Let's see how situation unfolds, oil rich nations don't need alternative sources as oil is very cheap there; India can tap n perfect solar/hydro but nuclear is still out of reach; der r countries in Europe n Canada where der is hardly any sun;situation is different everywhere
2606 2018-05-28 18:32:18 Castor oil is so amazing actually
2607 2018-05-28 18:32:11 In Texas (the oil state).

2610 2018-05-28 18:31:54 The nation’s four largest oil companies are poised to reap some $15 billion in tax benefits over the next decade from the GOP’s tax law, while gas prices reach their highest levels in years.
2611 2018-05-28 18:31:53 I would tell them to stay at the Microtel because there’s a Tim Hortons and a Great Canadian Oil Change nearby.
2612 2018-05-28 18:31:49 . #HWBush was the Director of Central Intelligence in the mid 70's, (1966-1977), #JFK was assassinated in 1963.. During that time, HW Bush was an oil businessman & didn't get into Gov. until 1966. How could he be involved? Not arguing, just want you to explain?!
2613 2018-05-28 18:31:47 The frosting actually shredded the carrot cakes. Pulled big chunks right out as I frosted. The gluten free cakes....well let's just say someone put used frying oil where the fresh oil is supposed to go.
2614 2018-05-28 18:31:32 Voice,have you been bending that poor girl at the knee?
You who was subjugated by EU for 40 years
It feels a fucking lot safer than the UK does voice I `ll tell you that.
We have oil and gas though,
you keep bending if you like

2620 2018-05-28 18:31:15 the new character is supposedly an android so i guess . he smells like diesel oil???
2621 2018-05-28 18:31:13 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
2622 2018-05-28 18:30:57 Should be there. The patina the oil stain is now making is fantastic, presumably the airframe now has a aged Castrol smell when In the cockpit?
2623 2018-05-28 18:30:55 I think you definitely have an inaccurate source of information. I’m gleaming this from your talk of asylum seekers “gaming the system”. If you want the source of the economic inequality look right here to corporations, oil industry, wall st. Who are the ones “gaming the system.”
2624 2018-05-28 18:30:40 My oil also can make me REALLY high if I'm already smoking but it relaxes the intense feeling in my brain so I'm able to function better. Like I usually fall asleep if I'm not active or at work
2625 2018-05-28 18:30:38 pls don’t put coconut oil on your face it can clog your pores badly
2626 2018-05-28 18:30:36 Scotland’s oil is worthless , and we have stacks of it

2629 2018-05-28 18:30:16 That's on purpose, to gain sympathy. For those that didn't see what happened would initially side with the crocodile tears.

2636 2018-05-28 18:29:23 Wow the one person I hang out with is gone so here I am with all this flower and oil!!!! Alone!!!
2637 2018-05-28 18:29:03 You traitors can all take your precious guns and shove them up your asses sideways
2638 2018-05-28 18:29:01 Exactly. Drill and pump the water down and the oil floats up. You understand!
2639 2018-05-28 18:29:01 the AC at my house is broken and it’s so hot that my coconut oil has completely liquified

2645 2018-05-28 18:28:45 The Bush administration, as Ralph Nader put it, was “marinated in oil,” with two oilmen at the helm & Chevron board member Condoleezza Rice, who had a double-hulled oil tanker named after her, as national security advisor.
2646 2018-05-28 18:28:37 ありがとうですー！そちらも！
2647 2018-05-28 18:28:28 Are Bhai don't ask stupid Qs for da sake of asking? So you want the rich fuel guzzlers 2 enjoy subsidies & we as a country remain indebted 4 life to oil producing /supplying countries? I wd any day pay a higher oil price if dat subsidises Ujwala & other pro poor impact schemes :)

2653 2018-05-28 18:27:19 Crude Oil prices crashed after 2008-09 world wide financial crash, as derivative buyers and sellers unwounded their positions in oil derivatives. Congress was in power till 26th May 2014. When did it reduce POL prices?

2655 2018-05-28 18:27:01 I put a lot of pickled things on sandwiches, but sandwiches I throw out have oil and vinegar soaked directly into the bread.
Pickle your onions for a few minutes, skip the oil.
Also, you know that oil + vinegar is a different flavour profile from mayo entirely, right?
2656 2018-05-28 18:26:54 Low tier ramen into top tier awesomeness: dried  kelp, hot pepper flakes during the boiling process; 2 tbsp soy sauce,  1tbsp olive oil on bottom of ramen bowl; diced green onion, 1 boiled  egg in half. Fantastic.
2657 2018-05-28 18:26:49 there's still coconut oil on me i feel like a greasy pig
2658 2018-05-28 18:26:47 Us waqt gov ne price km nhi kiye aur saare oil companies to hundred or crores loss me thi unko bachaya tha...desh ki economy nhi dekhna ???

2660 2018-05-28 18:26:31 CBD oil, and indica strains. I had L5/S1 discectomy and laminectomy, and as a rec user since '84, I'd never believed it would help, post-surgery. But, it did. The pain meds and relaxers did little for discomfort. I know, trendy, but true! Inflammation and pain levels poof!

2662 2018-05-28 18:26:12 They're not really that much different.  Both need to be seasoned with oil after you clean them.  There's almost definitely a Youtube video on how to do that.
2663 2018-05-28 18:25:51 Gas prices are the highest they’ve been in nearly four years despite the multibillion-dollar windfall that oil companies received from the GOP-backed tax bill.
2664 2018-05-28 18:25:42 #channel4news Unbelievably biassed report against Syrian regime by Channel 4 News - very disappointing!  Just because the Western supported rebel side lost - and with it another  puppet-leader-sanctioned grab of the country's massive mineral resources.  All about oil again!

2672 2018-05-28 18:25:02 Doesn't surprise me... Shit, I've seen this one. Well someone found her "pleasant" enough to have a kid with her. The big take away from this video is she's "well aware" of her first amendment rights, though she never gave a second thought to it applying to others.
2673 2018-05-28 18:24:47 @samheughan pepper oil!
2674 2018-05-28 18:24:38 Very. Means less fossil fuels used. Which means less carbon
 Which means more penguins can stay where they should as the ice won't melt as much. Also means less ppl going to war as we don't need as much oil or gas.  So yes... very good.
2675 2018-05-28 18:24:37 Oil slick, it's so cool.
2676 2018-05-28 18:24:36 These hoes always tryna get u to do some extra shit u don’t need Bitch change my oil hoe
2677 2018-05-28 18:24:36 Maybe so, but can you explain why oil prices started going up after Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal? Supply and demand doesn't account for that.
2678 2018-05-28 18:24:24 Something to do with North Sea oil?
2679 2018-05-28 18:24:19 Yes I am looking for the position of Administration Officer having nine years experience in Oil &Gas fields.

Petri dollar about to varnish
2681 2018-05-28 18:23:56 Hey Norm. We tried to cut off our shipments of oil to you but your socialist politicians threatened to sue to force us to ship oil to you. HYPOCRITES.
2682 2018-05-28 18:23:50 Both good but that oil is slick.
2683 2018-05-28 18:23:38 ALERT! Do be careful with these strong oils. A friend sneezed while applying Basil Oil, a drop splashed into her eye and burned her retina. She’s half blind in that eye. Just because things are natural doesn’t make them safe to splash on all over!

2696 2018-05-28 18:22:13 Those are for oil lights. You're not proving anything. I'm beginning to think you are a TOTAL fraud.
2697 2018-05-28 18:22:09 Soo are you going to use the oil stuff as a leave in? Like what type of gel do you use

2704 2018-05-28 18:21:30 And so many artists do both. I rarely produce a finished oil painting without slapping some pixels on there.
2705 2018-05-28 18:21:29 Brooke Baldwin in that video is proof that no matter how much you pay for spray-on tans, they still don't look good.
2706 2018-05-28 18:21:21 Mas eles tem energia. Quanto mais o petroleo sobe,mais o Shale Oil fica viavel . Quanto mais tempo passa, mais a tecnologia e o custo de producao cai.. Desculpe,  America ganhou. Eles nao sao mais vulneraveis em energia. Nao como em 1970-1980.
2707 2018-05-28 18:21:14 Nice try at spreading hysteria. About have a bathtub full of oil was released n a fully-contained site. It was cleaned-up and the line was running again within hours. Also Trans Mountain Pipeline is not for sale. Go peddle your BS elsewhere.
2708 2018-05-28 18:21:09 Voting for oil slick (that's some bad-ass color)
2709 2018-05-28 18:21:08 Apologists can use oil money excuse as to why City can buy anyone but when you see what Liverpool are doing on the market & what Arsenal are doing, then something is wrong.
2710 2018-05-28 18:21:05 Nobody turned to plastic to save trees. It's just cheaper at present oil prices. When groceries ask "paper or plastic?" paper is the treehugger response. Pulpwood pines that paper is made from also grow much like weeds; they're farmed all over the Southeastern US.
2711 2018-05-28 18:20:59 Seriously  Ignant of u.  Blacks thrived due to technology advancement (coal, oil, steel).  Black doctors and nurses (MeHarry/Fisk university) Pullman Porters.   Not Jim Crow. This was black middle class.
2712 2018-05-28 18:20:54 I don't get that fancy. Halve the sprouts, spray on a little canola oil, salt, pepper, and a tiny bit garlic powder. Roast them sumnas until brown on top and munch away.
2713 2018-05-28 18:20:50 He was never CIA as an operative, at least known publicly. In the 60's he ran an oil business where he built up personal wealth ( not family $, family wealth was already plentiful ) & by late 60's he was elected to the House. He was appointed Director of CIA under Ford.
2714 2018-05-28 18:20:46 Elephant in room on many and this (inch) beach. Cars??? Seriously you can’t put in a forecourt without massive spill protection and oil catch solutions, yet you can drive on a beach? Go figure!  @DenisNaughten
2715 2018-05-28 18:20:42 @WBrettWilson US Ocean Ind Asoc to WP “While the stated goal is to reduce dependence on oil, the fact remains that a major shift from oil as a fuel is still many years away, Nye said Thus such a pipeline ban will likely actually increase importation of oil from foreign countries”
2716 2018-05-28 18:20:40 Shit, there's no losing here, they're both fantastic. That oil slick is RILL PURTY, though.
2717 2018-05-28 18:20:31 Oil slick.
2718 2018-05-28 18:20:30 あ〜デフォルメでニシシッって笑ってる感じがいいなぁーポーズはピースしてて背景は適当！画像のどっかにおいる！って書いて欲しい！
2719 2018-05-28 18:20:27 Considering the fuel price, I'm sure they will opt for Pushpak Vimans as the replacement. Moreover, oil comes from Mullah countries and hence is by default anti-hindu. Virat Hindus should demand strict measures against such seditious imports.
2720 2018-05-28 18:20:27 Fri-light is that low calorie spray stuff. Can’t really count it as oil
2721 2018-05-28 18:20:08 Not to celebrate people losing their job (unless it’s Dallas Eakins) but I’m glad to see the Oil Kings making changes. It’s been 4 years since the Mem Cup win, let’s get this team back on the upswing

2725 2018-05-28 18:20:00 I should change my oil and get gas and do laundry but like...nah
2726 2018-05-28 18:19:58 Oil was jumping before that as a reflection of the economy.
2727 2018-05-28 18:19:45 For max. browning I'd go with a good peanut oil if you have it.
2728 2018-05-28 18:19:43 Get rid of oil . Waste of money. Go fossil free!
2729 2018-05-28 18:19:21 I deep condition every night . I need a hot oil treatment
2730 2018-05-28 18:19:19 Let's revisit 5 years of #PTI in #KPK

1. BRT.
2. Zoo.
3. Swat motorway.
4. Peshawar Heritage Trail.
5. Karak oil refinery (project in pipeline).
6. Reforms in health sector
7. Reforms in Police

9. Eight (8) news universities
2731 2018-05-28 18:19:08 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2732 2018-05-28 18:19:00 Trump has beefed up our military and naval presence throughout the world and bombed Russian-backed Syria. Russia's biggest exports are petroleum, natural gas, coal & oil and Trump is lifting regulations to compete w/ them. None of his actions are exactly Russia-friendly.

2734 2018-05-28 18:18:54 Any particular reason you use oil? Also why do they  egg so much? 
2735 2018-05-28 18:18:49 Ninad Ji from 1953 to 2007 my Airline Paid unbroken dividends to government of india - even when the Gulf Oil crisis took place -#airindia soared !
Relieve us of the UPA dent & watch us soar again !!
2736 2018-05-28 18:18:30 Tissue oil you lovely thing..get on my face! #tissueoil #winterlotion
2737 2018-05-28 18:18:27 Republicans and allies, Russia & Saudi, unite to burn 5 trillion bbl oil under Russia for $, raising temp globally too high for crops to grow and for ppl to survive. 

It doesn’t have to be this way
2738 2018-05-28 18:18:26 And what business are he and his followers disrupting to extort money?
2739 2018-05-28 18:18:25 @smritiirani madam, now oil  and gas prices are skyrocketed and now no dharna. 
Plz have courage to speak up.
2740 2018-05-28 18:18:22 This is stupid imagination, higher oil prices actually helps them
2741 2018-05-28 18:18:19 *At Khan’s Grill*
Cook: Hi, how are you doing?
Girl next to me: Olive oil
2742 2018-05-28 18:18:18 Stay tuned and watch Google get broken into pieces. The Standard Oil of Tech
2743 2018-05-28 18:18:17 Lmao having someone who knows about cars and shit and helping me check the water and oil is great 
2744 2018-05-28 18:18:17 my dad can never just get gas, he always gotta like check the oil or some shit lmao why
2745 2018-05-28 18:18:16 CBD oil? Tried it yet?
2746 2018-05-28 18:18:14 nine fresh onion greases
a hair oil
7 minty buttock oils
some knuckle fingers
3 grey lime corns
2747 2018-05-28 18:17:43 Or split them in two, make some diamond shapencuts on the pulp, then oil,  salt,  garlic, and  parsley diced thin and in oven 180°C until them cooked..
 Ohhhh yeaaaaaa
2748 2018-05-28 18:17:42 What? Why not? I take straight cannabis oil, the thick black oil that contains all the terpenes and cannabinoids, etc. that contribute to the taste/smell of cannabis and it's delicious although strong if in public
2749 2018-05-28 18:17:42 You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows. #YESHUA Psa 23:5
2750 2018-05-28 18:17:40 Oh yeah, I know about GCEP (actually referred to it when bringing up the issue of fossil fuel influence at @YaleFES) - I was just kind of hoping there was some response to this award.. giving an Earth Systems Sci award to a pale, stale, male, oil exec? really?
2751 2018-05-28 18:17:37 We don't care about fuel prices because all the essential things likes of Pulses, Rice , flour, vegetables, oil, refined, spices are very cheap we r spending less what were used to do before it may be agenda for journo sitting in AC room & never go to market 
#TeestaUPAConspiracy
2752 2018-05-28 18:17:35 Gas will be cheaper in #texas right? Because the oil is right there?  #roadthoughts
2753 2018-05-28 18:17:02 How many soldiers (children of countries) have we sacrificed in wars motivated in large by our dependence on oil? Just another reason we need to overturn the oil lobby and pursue green energy: greater peace in the world.
2754 2018-05-28 18:16:54 待ってるからな
2755 2018-05-28 18:16:47 and that was the biggest oil spill of all time !
2756 2018-05-28 18:16:43 Imperialism isnt respect for veterans. In fact, it is the opposite

Sending people to die in wars over oil and geopolitics when they think they are serving the country is just one way to disrespect veterans

Many Iraq veterans are disabled and now know their service was a sham
2757 2018-05-28 18:16:35 Edmonton Oil Kings announce they have fired HC Steve Hamilton with GM Randy Hansch not returning as he has taken position with NHL team

2762 2018-05-28 18:16:04 you forget to mention stealing oil from middle east and gulf countries 
2763 2018-05-28 18:15:59 Nathan has spilled more with the drops that fall on the ground from the nozzle after he fills up his car over the years. Nobody wants an oil spill, least of all oil companies.
2764 2018-05-28 18:15:46 Whip together 4 tsps cookies with 4 cups duck. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve on bread
2765 2018-05-28 18:15:32 @acoyne showing he has never changed his own oil. My boat has 2 x 5.0L engines that take about 5.5L oil each or 11L per change. ;)
2766 2018-05-28 18:15:24 I guess I go get the oil change by myself 
2767 2018-05-28 18:15:19 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
2768 2018-05-28 18:15:09 Get magnolia oil from pep. Its R20 a bottle. Mix it with E45 and it will stop any itching and fade marks.
2769 2018-05-28 18:14:55 Lavender oil baby
2770 2018-05-28 18:14:53 Yes... it’s just dishonest
2771 2018-05-28 18:14:29 Need to oil up for the sun!!
2772 2018-05-28 18:14:28 But who will buy the oil? Tanker fuel is being 'upgraded' by 2020 and Alberta 'oil' will be too costly to refine with even for tanker fuel so - again-  why are we building this pipeline and who will buy it?
2773 2018-05-28 18:14:26 Yesss baby oil !! Xxx
2774 2018-05-28 18:13:57 Damn, I spilt more changing the Oil in my Ford on the weekend, am I obligated to make a press release?
2775 2018-05-28 18:13:57 And why are we - an oil rich country with several world leading export industries - so far behind similar countries right now? How long will we be waiting to catch up to them if we stick with the status quo that's put us here?
2776 2018-05-28 18:13:52 Now that is really classy...intentionally spilling oil and littering???? Do you have no bounds for bad behavior

2779 2018-05-28 18:13:26 That aren’t cheap, but if they work then i’m all for it. He gave me 3 days (AM & PM) worth of a skincare product samples he put together for me. A face wash, oil, serum, & moisturizer. I’ve noticed a difference within 3 days. But consistently keep up with a routine
2780 2018-05-28 18:13:25 Coconut oil and jojoba oil....How much is and which stores can i try?
2781 2018-05-28 18:13:17 その日までは大丈夫だったのです。ただ、その徹夜続きの最後の方、もうすごい悪寒と動悸がして、さすがにやばいなぁと。
とはいっても、睡眠不足なら寝れば治るだろうと思っていたんですが、全然そんなことはなく、それ以降動悸と立ちくらみ持ちで始終ふらふらしてるんです。
2782 2018-05-28 18:13:16 Amid growing uneasiness, oil prices suddenly fell.

2798 2018-05-28 18:12:14 came to the beach but forgot that I put on coconut oil. I’m about to be burnt 
2799 2018-05-28 18:12:12 I recommend you try tuna or salmon collar. It's pretty cheap relative to the rest of the fish and it has more fat and flavor than most cuts. You can smoke it in the egg with a nice marinade (ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sake)

(I want to see those angels, and I'll take that oil anytime)
2816 2018-05-28 18:10:48 Sir as far crude oil price  is 77$ per barrel in other words 34 rs  per litre in International  markets. Though  I  agree  government  need  to  curb oil  prices

2831 2018-05-28 18:09:44 Just being me? Wanting therapies to have an evidence base and be regulated for safety? Yes, I know I am extremely unreasonable. I haven't studied cannabis oil in any great depth. I know the NEJM trial re: seizures. But it isn't so much the safety aspect which I do not have
2832 2018-05-28 18:09:21 You mean the normal castor oil 
2833 2018-05-28 18:09:13 Fala Bruninho, sim e não. Os interesses agora não são mais os R$ economizados. Agora a Shaile Oil americana já foi a bolsa com a desvalorização de R$ 150 bilhões em dois dias, e Allende no Chile caiu através de algo muito parecido com o que estamos vendo. Temos de estar atentos
2834 2018-05-28 18:09:12 Have this day in February and get back to me then about how awesome and “oh why can’t everyone just pedal to work so we can get off this darn tooting societal oil addiction” day is bro #biketoworkday
2835 2018-05-28 18:09:03 What does he mean by "trans humanist"?   Is sci-fi it means someone who believes in augmenting the body with tech.  Is he like half-man/half-machine?  Does he clank when he walks?  Does he occasionally need an oil can?  Does he lack a heart?

2850 2018-05-28 18:07:38 I am also one of the tax payer of this country... I accept the increase in oil price till our country gives back all the debt / sin committed by the previous Govt. Instead of barking like this, urge the Central and All the state Govt to stop the free bees,

2853 2018-05-28 18:07:29 When, amid growing uneasiness, oil prices suddenly fell. The cause: a President Trump tweet Early Friday  telling the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that its “artificially Very high” prices are unacceptable, let us see what happens this week Libtards.

2857 2018-05-28 18:07:12 All I want is an oil diffuser for my birthday. 

Who am I and why am I just now turning 30? (I’m actually turning 33)
2858 2018-05-28 18:07:06 US Bond Market should pay attention to the following: ADP Wednesday, PCE Thursday, and employment report Friday. Oil will continue to drive breakevens and relative performance of TIPS vs. TSYS.  Focus on these rather than the NK saga.
2859 2018-05-28 18:07:01 Get E45 tomorrow. It will sooth out your skin. For tonight bath in baby oil to hydrate it.

2865 2018-05-28 18:06:07 You should be looking at the federal marine oil spill response regime in general, which includes, but is not limited to, the role of ROs in spill response. We need to look at the respective roles of the public, i.e. @CoastGuardCAN and private, i.e. @MarineResponse sector roles.
2866 2018-05-28 18:06:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2867 2018-05-28 18:06:03 Well Imperialism never left, it just changed clothes, putting on the dress of a banker from the IMF.  That IMF banker offers a loan equivalent to the predatory Payday lenders in the U.S.  They do it for cheap oil, gold, any raw natural resources of value.
2868 2018-05-28 18:06:03 Why you Bhakt don't use your brain , Rohingya , China,  Doklam all are not related to oil prices , just try to open your eyes ,our Govt looting people of India by  excessive taxation on oil ..

2872 2018-05-28 18:05:31 This is a perfect example of why the American people elected Pres.Trump. the whole Russia thing is hoax. Unless Putin is insane. Our President knows the Evils of Communism. Their economy is size of Texas. Ramping up LNG & shale oil, will end Europe's dependence. US allies first.

2885 2018-05-28 18:03:51 Well this is all logical and the burden on the common man is expected to boomerang on the government. We must also take into perspective the Indian Oil and Gas companies which are burdened with 1 lakh crore rupees of government subsidy
2886 2018-05-28 18:03:33 You bought it. Fact. Without the oil money you d be in the conference.

2898 2018-05-28 18:02:34 Honestly I make chips on the grill all the time and they're amazing. Slice, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and some garlic powder. Toss on the grill until they brown up on both sides.
2899 2018-05-28 18:02:18 News to me: Did God ask Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld et all, to go to Iraq and get their oil? Don't tell me that is in your Bible.

2904 2018-05-28 18:01:40 But..but.. ketchup???  lol. Also a little olive oil infused with garlic and ginger or rosemary is good. Just enough to give it a tiny coating.
2905 2018-05-28 18:01:35 They do a good almond butter also no palm oil either
2906 2018-05-28 18:01:33 Being a PM when oil is $ 110 a barrel and when it is $40 dollar a barrel is like driving a tractor versus a Lamborghini. So when you are in your comfort zone but srilll won’t pass the benefit to the aam aadmi, what does one say? Gnight, shubhratri.

2921 2018-05-28 18:00:38 How did "the left" pave the way for ISIS & Iran?  We currently have issues with Iran due to the CIA overthrowing Mosaddegh because he wanted to nationalize Iran's oil.  ISIS happened when we invaded a country for the 2nd time that had never attacked us.

2931 2018-05-28 17:59:55 Tuhle důležitou informaci Gibiš vypustil: "...that the Wagner Group (...) is in Syria to seize oil and gas fields and protect them on behalf of the Assad government. The mercenaries earn of a share of the production (!!!) proceeds from the oil fields they reclaim, officials said.
2932 2018-05-28 17:59:48 Rudi ukamwange oil wacha na pang’ang’a na vitu hiyo kichwa maji yako haiwezani..
2933 2018-05-28 17:59:42 でももう切ってしまったら捨てるしかない…
2934 2018-05-28 17:59:33 When the price of the crude oil is barely raised for the past 3 years..
2935 2018-05-28 17:59:26 Texas with a majority of Democrats, African Americans and Latinos has not had a Dem elected to statewide ofc in Texas is proof of gerrymandering, bribery corruption by the cattle butchers, oil barons and war profiteers of Texas

2943 2018-05-28 17:58:08 Interesting decisions by the Oil Kings. Even more interesting that it seems Peter Chiarelli is making the call. Anyone else find that strange? Why add that job to the one he's, in many people's opinion, already struggling to do?

Why are you beset with gloom? 
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

2953 2018-05-28 17:56:56 wrong, that GDP growth is mainly coming from higher oil prices and is also even higher in Russia and Texas thanks to those places being run by conservative governments
2954 2018-05-28 17:56:52 Oil Kings should go off the board for the Head Coach, hire a rising star from USHL
2955 2018-05-28 17:55:55 Ice packs in the bed, I have a spray bottle of water and a few drops of peppermint oil I keep spraying - that's the best I've figured out so far now that I live in the UK! Back in the USA everyone has Aircon  stay cool

2959 2018-05-28 17:55:18 as someone there, IN SPITE OF, not at ALL because of BIG, USELESS government taking more of our money and running the province into $96 BILLION of debt that will take more than a decade to repay. Mainly due to oil prices which aren't under their control!
2960 2018-05-28 17:55:13 not surprising since most people seem to assume LaJoie will be offered the Oil Kings job for a couple months now.

2966 2018-05-28 17:54:47 If the peasantry cohort continued to elect Dublin TDs & Councillors & Munster TD who were “professional” lobbyists for planning mobile telecoms & oil explorers these who merely set out to impede democracy can look forward to Dáil seats & plenary indulgences with Vatican postmarks
2967 2018-05-28 17:54:44 Just imagine: England paying Scotland for oil and natural gas; England paying Scotland for power from our green resources; England asking for a trade deal to fish in our waters, import our whisky and world class shell fish...
2968 2018-05-28 17:54:39 or is it for something that is not stocks. ie did we get a turn in oil or bonds last week?

2997 2018-05-28 17:51:40 It was "worst meeting ever" because it was chaired by Iranian head of sports organisation who was tasked by Ahmadinejad to moon-light as acting oil minister! I still remember Naimi's face!
2998 2018-05-28 17:51:33 Olive oil from olives
Olives are a fruit not a vegetable
Basic mistake sir
2999 2018-05-28 17:51:27 To be more specific, with the money they made selling us oil.  And it's continuing to this day as they use their oil profits to spread what they think is important. Our money, buys their oil, spreads their religion. It wouldn't be so bad if islam wasn't a conversion faith.
3000 2018-05-28 17:51:12 Just pray on some olive oil and add it in the bottle. Its holy cause you prayed on it you won't know.

3003 2018-05-28 17:51:07 Ladies PLEASE don’t put coconut oil on your face in this heat. All it does is is clog pours because it traps and holds dirt
3004 2018-05-28 17:50:58 You're garbage no matter how you look at it but at least you haven't sent our soldiers off to die for oil yet. Nice.
3005 2018-05-28 17:50:48 Trump you are full of crap. Refineries, your oil company pals, screw us any time they choose. They always claim refinery capacity and changing seasonal blends. Obama has been gone over a year and we were producing more oil under him than ever
3006 2018-05-28 17:50:36 Hey snake oil sales guy, pretty sure Jesus (I know you’re a big fan, I saw it in your Twitter profile) would have seen them as kids without parents, not illegals.  Try compassion — it’s what your Lord modeled his life after.  #walkthewalkdontjusttalkit
3007 2018-05-28 17:50:05 I have been trying so hard. The best thing for me that doesn't dry out my skin is charcoal scrub/masks and coconut oil. But coconut oil can be bad for u if u already have oily skin !

3009 2018-05-28 17:49:53 I’m “I just got excited because oil prices are falling” years old.
3010 2018-05-28 17:49:49 Counting the days until I’m sitting by that pool.....until then making do with ‘Asian rain’ fragrance in the oil diffuser.

3014 2018-05-28 17:49:25 I dropped my car off a Nissan for an oil change and ended up leaving with an oil change, a new air filter, 4 recalls, and them telling me I needed new front and rear breaks. 
3015 2018-05-28 17:49:03 I was middle mgmt in the oil & gas ind for years(ret). If I'd submitted a budget forecast for my boss's approval w ONLY end cost figures, with no suppporting data, and said, "but it's ok, trust me", I would have been shown the door in short order. Ford is no different. No one is.

3018 2018-05-28 17:48:58 Kyle: My parents were not well off, but I bought my first car at 16 as well. Made every loan payment, gas, oil, insurance, maintenance, ect on that car.  Never borrowed a dollar from my parents after I moved out at 18, paid my own way through college, and started my own business
3019 2018-05-28 17:48:08 TRUMP IS NOTHING BUT A MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE! It has ALWAYS been about his family(ESP HIS FATHER AND UNCLE) SELLING US OUT TO LOBBYIST AND OIL! We know his families history. What did his uncle John George Trump do with Tesla's missing trunks with the plans for clean free energy?
3020 2018-05-28 17:47:57 Likely. Seems like Bobby Nix is their networker and marketer, trot out for public events

Last I looked Kevin Lowe is still the governor of the Oil Kings.

3022 2018-05-28 17:47:44 It must be a Monday on @CNN
3023 2018-05-28 17:47:44 US oil companies have a surplus of crude oil and has been increasing it’s exports every year! No short of crude oil at home but they raise the price anyway! Doesn’t matter which party is in office!
3024 2018-05-28 17:47:35 Many investors think of big oil & traditional utilities when dividends come up. However, #cleanenergy stocks like TerraForm Power ($TERP), Brookfield Renewable ($BEP), & Pattern Energy ($PEGI) all have hefty yields of 6% or more! #veganinvesting #dividends
3025 2018-05-28 17:47:31 So. Dyeing my own hair did not go smooth. Dye was everywhere. I literally just rubbed coconut oil all over my chest and arms because it takes hair dye off. I’m dying

3027 2018-05-28 17:47:16 #Did_you_know effectively electric cars were being produced in the 1900"s, J.P Morgan (oil, copper mines) and Edison and Westinghouse nipped the electric car industry in the bud by literally burning it down and destroying even the idea of it #Nikola_Tesla

3030 2018-05-28 17:47:03 Is there a car concierge service in Fredericton. What a hassle getting an oil change. In Woodstock, Corey Ford just fits you in, great service....but I'm in Fton everyday and it's like pulling teeth getting an oil change.
3031 2018-05-28 17:46:50 I've heard the Oil Kings reached out to Willie Desjardins about both jobs but couldn't get anything done.
3032 2018-05-28 17:46:49 Courts will be burning midnight oil to ensure she gets ‘bail’ed out.

3041 2018-05-28 17:45:46 The problem is that Iran has a security pact with Syria and has been invited in. What is not clear is when Israel will withdraw from its illegal occupation of the Golan Heights and the theft of oil by Genie Energy and also its water!
3042 2018-05-28 17:45:43 Most media is owned by big oil

3051 2018-05-28 17:44:44 shut up inorganic oil
3052 2018-05-28 17:44:42 Ignorance is blessed. I suggest a small course on supply and demand in a free market economy, and then and only then make comments like this. Irán Ranks number eight in oil exports in the world, and it’s marketshare can be made up by Saudi Arabia by turning over a valve.
3053 2018-05-28 17:44:40 So you think it's wise to run oil in tanker cars down the banks of the Fraser river putting multiple runs of already supposedly endangered salmon at risk from an derailment ? You have some clue of how to clean up oil in a rapidly moving river do you ?
3054 2018-05-28 17:44:36 DEMS are blaming it on Iran deal not trump which is actually foolish consider sanctions don't start for 90 to 180 days . Russia and OPEC cut supply increasing prices . Drilling for oil is a protection DEMS refuse .
3055 2018-05-28 17:44:35 If I were India before you say you won’t think about it ! Food talk out loud for everyone that needs it. Iran think the Oil they have can control the . Forget it there’s other resources and cleaner safer better.
3056 2018-05-28 17:44:26 we have spent the last 15 years or so at war for oil in the middle east
3057 2018-05-28 17:44:25 Keyamo is a Judas. I thought he was smart and wise, He’s defending the worst president ever. Buhari was persecuting, sacking and arresting southerners, Milking our Oil, position Fulanis and this Fool was supporting him just for a mere political position. biggest disappointment

3060 2018-05-28 17:43:46 Is the price of Oil up? Is it a commodity like natural gas. The Liberal government has folded the economy in Canada and it will take forever to gain foreign investors. Keep voting them in a trillion $ debt isn’t far away
3061 2018-05-28 17:43:39 When we used candles and oil lamps to illuminate our homes we had a lot more house fires. Interestingly, when we reduced the number of open flames in our homes we also reduced the number of house fires. Candles don’t kill people, fires do? #GunControlNow

3066 2018-05-28 17:43:06 Unfortunately, Kenya is highly invested in the Oil and Gas Industry and is just as corrupt as the United States, and yes, the Oil and Gas Industry owns Coal and Nuclear “Standard Oil/ Exxon Mobil”.
3067 2018-05-28 17:43:06 Please redice excise duty on petrol and deisel. Otherwise bjp will lose piblic support. Oil vompanies are looting. Bring this under gst. Showchalay not required. Reduce price

3074 2018-05-28 17:42:28 To quote a friend - I like that oil and water never mix and that they are symbolic of separateness among us but they both go in brownies.

3080 2018-05-28 17:41:41 I sincerely wish #AmericanTruckers  would rally around  one another with one voice  to STOP the outright contempt of Big Oil to arbitrarily hike #DieselPrices at will . Soon enough as we see our bottom line evaporating they'll risk a nationwide  protest if it continues . #Strike

3083 2018-05-28 17:41:16 @LoganSurfboards The crude oil in our oceans that your GOPer @HarleyRouda profits off of seems to really be getting to you. Frauda isn’t the strongest GOP candidate or even the strongest “Dem” candidate. #HarleyShouldDropOut

3087 2018-05-28 17:41:07 I love when a response to any one of the Trump clan’s tweets gets more attention (RTs and likes) than their original absurd or idiotic post. They’re all the same. Gutless and soulless snake oil salesmen
3088 2018-05-28 17:40:59 does anyone have tips for eyebrow growth? I’m currently using coconut oil to thicken them up but I want to try something else

3105 2018-05-28 17:38:46 I’ll bring oil upon request.
3106 2018-05-28 17:38:45 You are right and the problem is that they are catered to. The squeaky wheel getting the most oil has gotten to the point that it's ridiculous. I've found that in work situations. The Internet has given the self-entitled a platform.

3111 2018-05-28 17:38:23 Haha. Yeah. Similar to the Condors I have wondered why Oil Kings haven’t been changed for a few years. 

Seemed different than the up and down cycles of Junior hockey to me
3112 2018-05-28 17:38:17 18th and 19th century whalers hunted whales for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and lubricant.
3113 2018-05-28 17:38:13 Reports from #goldspider our trader goon in London. :p lol

Says there is some reshuffling of central banks reserves going on in response to the shake out of #oil.
Alot of positioning going on.

Eager to see how things go later on this
3114 2018-05-28 17:38:00 Superb idea. Modern medicines are nothing compared to the raw power of cannabis and it's derivative products such as oil.
I have a close friend who is ex UK army who served multiple times in conflict; suffers greatly from PTSD; cannabis resolves this for him. Still illegal though
3115 2018-05-28 17:38:00 Holy shit, why is this even a story? Hurry, call Greenpeace, call David Suzuki!! I use more oil than that in my weedwacker! Cleanup will probably require a couple of paper towels
3116 2018-05-28 17:37:50 CBD oil legal July 1st but only with 0%THC. #SadIndiana has outdated laws.

3119 2018-05-28 17:37:33 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
3120 2018-05-28 17:37:31 Hehehehehehe  ‘Bread and Groundnut oil!’ .... you deserve some accolades brah. #Truth.
3121 2018-05-28 17:37:26 But hopefully you’ve had/will have some black pepper oil massages this week 
3122 2018-05-28 17:37:19 Seeing the number of comments defending that cake store, I know Nigerians don't know what really good cake tastes like...

I mean I tasted the vegetable oil each time I had cake from there so blech.
3123 2018-05-28 17:37:18 Not with this Congress. Nor so many rabid blue states. But then, the left has zero chance of removing 2A.
3124 2018-05-28 17:37:15 He he he! and I think they intend to keep it that way unless the English arrive up and claim it as their own as they did with the oil
3125 2018-05-28 17:37:11 1) Idea
2) Oh, yeh, I can totally do this
3) Order parts and try to fit them together
4) This will never never work, why did I think I could build it, I'm an idiot. Why, oh why, oh why! 
5) Late nights screaming at project
6) Oh, a dry joint/syntax error/needed oil
7) Goto step 1

3127 2018-05-28 17:37:04 PM is silent on fuel hike. Intl prices cane down. Still our oil companies are looting. Grave mistake bjp doing by allowing this. Vote will go to congress
3128 2018-05-28 17:37:03  my rose petal sugar scrub and frankincense oil. I also take these supplements from @urbanskin
3129 2018-05-28 17:36:49 I thought @anomalyxd got the demons out with the oil?
3130 2018-05-28 17:36:42 Whenever I be seeing females talk about how niggas can’t change a flat or change they oil or fix some shit around the house I’m like.. 
3131 2018-05-28 17:36:36 #OOTT: what’s the best way to gain financial exposure to oil prices in your opinion?

[Disclaimer: Not gonna take this as investment ADVICE but RESEARCH]
3132 2018-05-28 17:36:29 They deserve to be memorialized by someone other than a draft dodging, snake oil salesman.
3133 2018-05-28 17:36:26 Yes is scary to think of the buried plastic Tim much of which also becomes micro plastic and is now in the ocean food chain and part of the fish that many people eat. Big oil lobbyists are spending millions to prolong use of plastic bags and bottles is all hard to believe
3134 2018-05-28 17:36:25 So alien sauce is just fish oil?
3135 2018-05-28 17:36:22 If u dont hv political maturity then its not anybody's fault 
whatever stupid media & social media is telling u , you just believe it & spread it like morons ... Enjoy being like that

3139 2018-05-28 17:35:58 If President Trump gets Iran to renegotiate the previous deal  and there are some signs that Iran is faltering then crude oil will get crushed. Is it so outrageous to think however Israel PM American President and new Saudi king wanting to end iranian regime once and for all
3140 2018-05-28 17:35:56 Why are so many people coming to get a damn oil change on Memorial Day?! Don’t y’all got lives?!
3141 2018-05-28 17:35:51 4 days ago 2,200 litres of fuel oil spilled on Malahat highway. Nothing.  2011 same highway 42,000 litres spilled still nothing.  You squawk about  100 litres.  Such bullshit
3142 2018-05-28 17:35:46 Yep, the snake oil salemen and bible thumpers are in charge and God has left the planet
3143 2018-05-28 17:35:46 ฮืออ ขอบคุณมากค่ะ
3144 2018-05-28 17:35:31 Why Trump put sanctions on Iran and Venezuela?  So he could by Oil stocks will run up.  It would be interesting if Trump's family and friends loaded up on Oil Stocks.
3145 2018-05-28 17:35:13 Truly believe electricity should be governmentally ran, and we the people pay a small fee to them that is constant. This would allow energy that is more efficient than oil and coal to enter the market. Proof? Nikola tesla and JP Morgan.
3146 2018-05-28 17:35:13 Not exactly. These rates r compared with dollar as common denominator. venezuela currency Bolivar against dollar is at 0.00001 only. What would be the effective rate then. Moreover it is a oil extracting nation and the economy is based on crude oil,  petrol rate really irrelevant
3147 2018-05-28 17:35:10 $3.17 yesterday I scared to go outside and drive anywhere today, they lighting our pockets up out here what happen to the oil subsidies from our tax dollars we starting to feel the burn so to speak
3148 2018-05-28 17:35:08 When Trump canceled the Iran deal oil went up 7.00 in minutes. He has something to do with this.
3149 2018-05-28 17:35:07 I remember reading an article at end of season that he would be involved in the Oil Kings end of season review. Questions were asked that maybe his focus should be almost entirely #oilers
3150 2018-05-28 17:35:01 Stop The Madness! Or I Will Use the Second Amendment! Keep Your Government Hands Off My Oil Well!  #Deathless
3151 2018-05-28 17:34:57 CNG prices up by Rs 1.36  per kg, petrol prices up for 15th consecutive day, Govt earnings from crude oil products in the last five years increased by 170 percent to Rs 2.67 lakh crore from Rs 98,602 crore revenue in FY13, why has the Govt not passed any benefit to the end users?
3152 2018-05-28 17:34:52 理系は賢くて文系は馬鹿みたいな考え方、専門も学習法も違うのに比較する時点で根本的に間違ってるし、それを言ってるのは理系じゃないからな
3153 2018-05-28 17:34:51 Vox? Again???
3154 2018-05-28 17:34:42 @crtucker418 Sorry to hear that. Did you get the oil changed yet?
3155 2018-05-28 17:34:40 How I use hot chili oil:
1) pull it out of the cabinet
2) look at it and think "I'm going to regret adding this to my food"
3) add it to my food
4) a short while later, I regret it
5) a couple days later, cook something else that could do with hot chili oil, and repeat...
3156 2018-05-28 17:34:36 @NeginMirsalehi1 just wanted to say I went to buy your Hair oil online after watching your you tube channel;which I love now !! But the oil is out of stock ! can you stock up please !! Thanks

3158 2018-05-28 17:34:27 Black seed oil , twice daily , cured my migraines.
3159 2018-05-28 17:34:12 No lie they was looking a tad thin tho I was shook but this castor oil for me back right 
3160 2018-05-28 17:34:08 I have to add oil to it to even work with it. I hate it. I told them. They didn’t listen. 
3161 2018-05-28 17:34:07 Yep! Nooch and olive oil too.
3162 2018-05-28 17:34:04 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! Zen is my favorite.
3163 2018-05-28 17:34:02 Oil companies making up for lost profit during #KarnatakaElection2018 & upcoming elections in this year
3164 2018-05-28 17:33:23 Yea it really is I think that it just sits on hair. But hopefully this works. Good things there’s a hair oil for everyone
3165 2018-05-28 17:33:17 I had reams of strange dreams last night. That olive oil I used to cook my chicken & rice must have really been something else.
3166 2018-05-28 17:33:04 The Iran Agreement Included oil export. Iran has the fourth largest oil reserve in the world. Off course it has a massive effect.
3167 2018-05-28 17:33:03 They paid attention in class.
3168 2018-05-28 17:32:53 #Modi facing immense domestic pressure due to rising oil prices. Perhaps this is to offset that with some cheap oil from #Iran
3169 2018-05-28 17:32:50 海に行くと錆びちゃう
3170 2018-05-28 17:32:45 Trump won the presidency, get over it. More people didn’t want Bernie Sanders or Hilary Clinton to be President. I’ve thought about it, nobody wanted to be President because of the hyper PC Obama and George Bush neocon oil scam. Trump knows how to win this for us.
3171 2018-05-28 17:32:39 Now they die for the 1% and oil
3172 2018-05-28 17:32:16 We need a two-part cleanup cost recovery model wherein the oil companies pay in advance. 1) $1 into a nonrefundable protection fund per X-number  of gallons shipped. 2) $100M+ bond, renewable annually.

3174 2018-05-28 17:32:02 gasoline isn't what was spilled, and in the context of a tarsands pipeline crossing vast areas of pristine wilderness, waterways and coastline, this is a very troubling pattern for the oil and gas industry which has yet to be addressed in any meaningful way
3175 2018-05-28 17:32:00 Came to get my oil changed and they told me basically everything in my car is leaking  my Jeep hasn’t let me down yet though so it’s fine
3176 2018-05-28 17:31:57 Oil massage at 10am. About to get my lifeeeee together.
3177 2018-05-28 17:31:48 It has been said that @JustinTrudeau supports 'responsible development of the oilsands'. In the midst of catastrophic human caused climate change either he is:

3180 2018-05-28 17:31:22 Toilet, so it cleans? No need to drink castor oil?
3181 2018-05-28 17:31:19 Let me ask yall something, everybody will not know nothing bout this... So don't feel bad if u dont. Spring Tonic frm back n a day CASTOR OIL! I can still remember the ass whippins i got behind CASTOR OIL every spring! Scary shyt, the thought make me sick.
3182 2018-05-28 17:31:11 Toh jab International crude oil 30$ per barrel tha tab kaunsa petrol 60 rupees me beek raha tha bhai....

3187 2018-05-28 17:30:59 With you there, Piers. My Mum and Dad worked hard and taught me the values I have. I've worked hard...as a 'grease monkey'...lol...own my own Co., have a crew of 25, live very simply and enjoy life when I'm not hanging off an Oil Rig in the Ocean. Just stay humble and enjoy!
3188 2018-05-28 17:30:58 Yeah it should be made affordable not via a loan but a subsidy you know like the ones farmers, oil companies and foreign governments get. Then we'd have some home grown educated and skill workers for the workforce #MakeAmericansFirst
3189 2018-05-28 17:30:57 Apart from the charging they are serviced with oil too won't you consider that too has food to it??
3190 2018-05-28 17:30:52 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
3191 2018-05-28 17:30:48 Andrew, this is a trivial oil spill. You know when it rains here thousands of litres of oil, fuels, lubricants get washed into the ocean. Marinas and fuel docks easily spill this much and more every single day. 

Also it spilled in a contained area so yes, this is not worth press
3192 2018-05-28 17:30:46 Mix 2 1/2 pints eggplant with 2 1/2 pints cookies. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with love.
3193 2018-05-28 17:30:36 Except all the oil is found in rock layers far older than your supposed flood. Plus, they’re localized floods. There is zero proof of a global flood

3195 2018-05-28 17:30:28 Shooting up oil prices daily harm the common man and his activities. It is high time to appropriately interfere in it .
3196 2018-05-28 17:30:26 Except when Trump canceled the Iran deal the price of oil went up 7.00 in minutes.
3197 2018-05-28 17:30:22 personally, I'm done with compromise. It's the same thing a appeasement and how often has that worked.
3198 2018-05-28 17:30:20 @DonaldJTrumpJr Access to oil rich public land isn't free either.
3199 2018-05-28 17:30:16 Yes use the plant cut it open and rub the jelly on your face and let it sit for about 10 to 15 mins and then use coconut oil afterwards do that like twice a week that’s what I’m trying now

3204 2018-05-28 17:29:20 States can cut petrol price by Rs 2.65 per litre and diesel by Rs 2 a litre if they decide to forego potential additional gains out of high crude oil rates, SBI report

3212 2018-05-28 17:28:34 Pineapple on pizza, BBQ, mashrooms and olive oil turn my stomach
3213 2018-05-28 17:28:32 Soya meal supports animal agriculture. What happens to the oil that is also extracted? I'll tell you. It feeds humans. Most popular table oil in THE WORLD. So maybe erosion is in support of humans insatiable demand for soya oil for own consumption.
3214 2018-05-28 17:28:19 you mean "for oil". not for the freedom of others
3215 2018-05-28 17:28:19 Crazy

3223 2018-05-28 17:27:15 @EastwoodCo I just got your new scroll compressor.  Step 1 is make sure it has enough oil.  It didn't, and no oil was included.  Can you please overnight me the oil that should've been included with the compressor?

3231 2018-05-28 17:26:42 @DougBernards The only safe, definitive test of the oil pressure- install a gauge. The pump could be worn (gears+pocket) and/or the OEM pressure sending unit is worn. It is calibrated to a set PSI, going below that makes the telltale AND dash gauge respond.

3238 2018-05-28 17:25:26 Why GST is not applicable on oil?
If oil comes under GST I think the the price will reduce(instead of excise duty and VAT). It will be very helpful to middle class family like us.

Maam please take this concern to the parliament.

3264 2018-05-28 17:22:04 Sorry I have to say this...from the Korean war on nobody was fighting for our freedom especially with the draft. Those young men had their freedom of choice taken away. How about the invasion and occupation of Iraq? War for oil and regime change.

3275 2018-05-28 17:20:39 South Africans and understanding the law is water and oil. Being accused is not the same as being guilty. I know of women who use rape allegations to get back at men. Its happening, it keeps happening. Until the court pronounces anyone is innocent
3276 2018-05-28 17:20:38 Kill speculation, and all those tankers with oil offshore that are playing the contango game ends.  Plus, Speculation forces consumers to hedge along for the ride to protect cost models.  Works in reverse too.

3280 2018-05-28 17:20:04 I have strong willpower when it comes to refusing food due to My ethics and beliefs (eg palm oil, certain brands, etc). The rest of the time, I just want to binge. 
I prefer to graze, but My doctor said I should have 5-6 small meals, instead. Effort!
3281 2018-05-28 17:19:56 @realDonaldTrump @NRA @TedNugent  so again CNN ran this story - America could become oil king of the world in 2018. Is it more fake news or are you just another fact less lying liberal who needs attention and will use what ever means possible. BE HONEST TRUTHFUL AND UPSTANDING
3282 2018-05-28 17:19:55 Nooo you did NOT fail

It feels like he's about to break into a dance!! Like an old oil painting
3283 2018-05-28 17:19:54 All the parasites in congress stand with wallets open and the oil companies oblige them
3284 2018-05-28 17:19:51 Sanctions don't increase the price of oil, quite the opposite as Saudis only have to increase production and so it lowers the prices.
3285 2018-05-28 17:19:40 Remember when Russia raised the rates on natural gas to Ukraine? Ukraine didn't go for it. Then the war started.
Remember when Iraq said no to US oil companies and signed contracts with EU oil companies? 
The war started (yes, the 9/11 war)
3286 2018-05-28 17:19:40 So Alberta's problems have nothing to do with decades of PCs ignoring all industry except for one? Unless the PCs can figure out how to make oil >$100bbl again, Alberta will continue to be the poster child of squandered opportunity.

3292 2018-05-28 17:18:41 "Discuss", I'm in agreement with you. Though, to get them to consider some compromise (thought experiment). It is always us that has to compromise with them. They need to start thinking about what they're willing to give up.
3293 2018-05-28 17:18:18 False. Oil prices are set by the market--and because of supply/demand issues and Trump's stupidity re: Iran, oil and gas prices have surged. Ford has not clue.
3294 2018-05-28 17:18:09 Leicester City won the league during this “oil and oligarch” era. It can be done.

Klopp has been one of the best supported managers in the transfer market and has come up short. How long should this continue before it’s deemed to be unacceptable?

Fat isn't all the same, ask @TuckerGoodrich

3305 2018-05-28 17:17:13 Can you explain why this is. Iran isn’t able to sell oil because of sanctions. So, how are they a player in the oil market? MAGA!

In fact, some evidence suggests that it was scientists working directly for the oil companies who discovered Climate Change in the first place, back in the 1970’s. 

Of course, all of their research was suppressed.

3345 2018-05-28 17:13:09 The truth is, in reality, all three of them played little to zero role in gas prices. Gas prices aren’t determined by the president, Congress, or any political entity. It’s set by the oil companies depending on how they’re doing extracting petroleum. Right now there’s a deficit.

3352 2018-05-28 17:12:14 @JustinTrudeau   More to consider is the FACT that oil is no longer king. In a couple of years it will be a court jester. Kill @KinderMorgan project & INVEST OUR MONEY IN SOLAR POWER, ALTERNATIVE FUELS LIKE HEMP!!! GET WITH IT! Your Dad would NOT have ignored viable options.
3353 2018-05-28 17:11:54 Everytime there's a spill or leak of oil or other toxic substances we later find out that the initial spill amount estimate was much less than the ACTUAL amount. So can we trust that only 100 litres, and no more, was spilled from KinderMorgan pipeline in Kamloops?
3354 2018-05-28 17:11:51 They have been trading in gold & oil only for the last 10 yrs. Now they expanded into diamonds. So nothing new here.
3355 2018-05-28 17:11:46 The spill was 100 litres, less than a barrel of oil. On KM property. It was cleaned up by a single vacuum truck.
3356 2018-05-28 17:11:45 Well ... think oil companies haven’t figured out 1/2 or more in Ottawa area work for government and are on expense accounts - like you !

3413 2018-05-28 17:06:57 These companies refine the crude oil into diseal and petrol.But they dont control the supply and demand which is controlled by OPEC. The US govt does influence opec but the prices usually go up during summer cuz consumption is high during summer.

3545 2018-05-28 16:53:05 My distant relative works in Oman. He said oil sector is booming now. Price will only rise. Saudi & Russia purposely stopped production last year to create a demand. Now demand is very high. Plus USA wants high oil price as its the largest oil producer in the world.Bad days ahead
3546 2018-05-28 16:52:56 women and children are disappearing from areas near oil fields, where thousands of workers from around the country live in “man camps.” Investigations have revealed human trafficking to be a factor in many of these instances, but police in native tribes do not have jurisdiction

3550 2018-05-28 16:52:46 OMG. Way to ruin a perfectly nice day. He has a website? And he sells “Made in China” crap on it? Gak!Puke! Hurl! What, no snake oil? Or is THAT where they procure their Koolaid? Figures. OK, is it a “normal thing” for a president to have a website that sells shit? Just asking

3554 2018-05-28 16:52:30 It is a common misconception that water is the opposite of fire as water is used to extinguish fire. Fire is extinguished because water cuts off the supply of oxygen to the inflammable material. The opposite of water is actually oil. @OfficialDragOn
3555 2018-05-28 16:52:29 I’m glad @brianlilley wrote this article. I’m tired of paying taxes that “expense” political spending on things they should be paying for themselves. From clothing to oil changes, new cars and party supplies the politician should pay for it out of pocket!!
3556 2018-05-28 16:52:27 Getting an oil change and this MF hops in my whip and revs the shit out of it -_-

3563 2018-05-28 16:51:21 Oh yippie, They can watch Trudeau's pipeline being built outside their bedroom window. All of that construction equipment operating will be ever so restful and peaceful. And, they may even get an Oil Spill flowing by as they stand on their bed hoping that it won't cover them.

3573 2018-05-28 16:50:10 No. How clean do you think American, Saudi and Venezuelan oil are? Hint: even more dirty than the most ethically and responsibly produced oil in the world. Go protest there if you want to make a difference

3578 2018-05-28 16:49:36 Take a moment today to reflect upon the fact that today's troops are fighting for no good cause, just oil and minerals. 

We haven't fought a just war since WWII, when Western civilization was on the brink of annihilation. #MemorialDay
3579 2018-05-28 16:49:35 I told my mom in casual conversation that my oil light came on yesterday. Between her, my aunt and grandad they got me panicking thinking I can’t even make it to jiffy lube without my car exploding. They will stress you out 
3580 2018-05-28 16:49:34 If wasn't for the liberal lunatics we'd have nothing to do.. 
3581 2018-05-28 16:49:31 Don’t tell me how fucked up my car is, just hush and change my oil
3582 2018-05-28 16:49:29 Those are both good. Sounds like you just need a moisturizer to complete the routine. Neutrogena’s hydro boost line is really good but if you like the au natural way raw coconut oil, then follow up with a mask once a week and don’t forget to exfoliate

3591 2018-05-28 16:48:57 I had an Hiort sailing cancelled in August ‘16 due to weather (the storm that caused the oil rig to wash ashore at Gearrannan), completely understand that. I’ll do a bit more digging into the bus schedule then watch the weather and ferry updates when I get there

3595 2018-05-28 16:48:24 It all seemed to really take off the last couple weeks. We even had some head out even after a dose of roundup and crop oil. It did die though.

Kinder Morgan just got another harsh message that their pipeline is not financially viable. So Trudeau's billions won't be enough. May tens of Billions?

3601 2018-05-28 16:48:02 A 100L oil spill is big news. These people have never seen a hydraulic hose blow before. A 100L can be on the ground, the tractor and the air drill before you can turn in your seat to turn it off. Come on find some real news to report!
3602 2018-05-28 16:48:02 The pipeline is fully contracted, companies have guaranteed transport fees to Kinder Morgan. They do this as they have lined up destinations to sell the product. Alaska Heavy Oil, California Heavy Oil, Venezuela Heavy Oil, Mayan heavy oil, Chinese heavy oils..all find a market.

3608 2018-05-28 16:47:12 Read your article on Gose about craft beer being dead back in 2015.  Funny.  Just had Coco Pina Gose by Costal Empire.. like drinking a pina colada on the beach through a penis covered in suntan oil.. refreshing

3611 2018-05-28 16:46:51 So you are saying that ice cream is compared to ice that means that ice cream floats in milk, both of them are solids. Water does not float like oil (a liquid) though. Therefore it has neutral buoyancy
3612 2018-05-28 16:46:49 Govt revenues aren’t tracking inflation. At least oil revenues. Why should recurrent expenditures (salaries specifically) be inflation adjusted?
3613 2018-05-28 16:46:47 Is it just as simple as coal and oil more valuable for heating and transport? And also transportable? (in war effort times when needed for ships etc) But I am assuming something about substitutions between fuel sources that I don't quite grasp from the ad.
3614 2018-05-28 16:46:35 I'm THIS  close to spooning my oil heater
3615 2018-05-28 16:46:35 Oh, I know! They want total control of the World oil resources.

3630 2018-05-28 16:44:15 I think the right time is now. Oil is only going to rise. Maybe could hit $100 by year end. BJP has messed up the fiscal situation, its only going to get worse. Opposition needs to capitalise.
3631 2018-05-28 16:44:13 Holy smokes, that's awesome. Is that oil painting or pastel ? Regardless, it looks amazing, Keep it up.

3633 2018-05-28 16:44:10 People carry in churches and restaurants. The indoor mall concept is slowly dying out for open air/strip malls and other than when business is slow in theaters (during weekdays before 4-5pm) I've seen at least one off-duty cop (during high volume, multiple cops).
3634 2018-05-28 16:44:07 Gap between Middle east #crude i.e. #Brent and American #CrudeOil i.e. #WTI has widened!

Brent trying to hold $75. This indicate that Saudi isn't in the mood to bring down oil prices soon!

Looks like #PetrolPrice will either be stable at this level or reach near 90 #Rupee soon
3635 2018-05-28 16:44:07 Oh ok, yea I don’t really shampoo even if it’s sulfate free. I wash with conditioner every 2 days then I style with leave in conditioner oil curling cream and maybe a light gel so it has lots of moisturizing products
3636 2018-05-28 16:44:05 Have you any proposal ,  to reduce the prices.  upa purchase on higher rate and payment not effected by UPA  , HUGE AMOUNT, balance to pay to supplier  like Iran etc.  ups had given the huge money  given to Indian oil companies,  subsidise the petrol - diesel  price .

3638 2018-05-28 16:44:01 The thing to remember about Savarkar is that at Kala Paani jail in Andaman he was tied to a oil mill and forced to ‘press’ oil like oxen. This perspective is never provided. People who talk about his ‘apology’ have a feeble and insectile sense of history. Do not be illiterate.
3639 2018-05-28 16:43:56 Seriously,  @RonWyden WTH?

We have more proven oil reserves than Saudi Arabia. 

The price of gas goes up EVERY year around Memorial Day

Isn't "blood for oil" supposed to be a bad thing?  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terror.

3651 2018-05-28 16:41:42 So when my son’s trainer recommended a probiotic, fish oil and some protein powder, good food and hard work, does that count as responsible? It’s very confusing for the basic consumer.

3684 2018-05-28 16:37:45 Actually Indian Oil (a SOE) buys most of the crude. Private refiners such as Reliance may stay off Iranian barrels to avoid US secondary sanctions. But Indian Oil takes its cues 100% from the Indian Government.
3685 2018-05-28 16:37:43 Yes, we can. Stop illegal wars, arming terrorists and terrorist nations, and stop sending our kids to die serving one Zionist nation, Israel and the defense, oil and big business industries. We learned nothing form the Iraq war except invading other countries and killing more.
3686 2018-05-28 16:37:30 Nah keep burning that coal/oil. Jokes aside the only gripe with wind turbines is the noise but Ill take it

3693 2018-05-28 16:36:08 The best way for #Trump to keep #American schools safe and American streets safe is to invade #Syria and loot the oil of Syria and to work with the terrorists in Syria. Shame! Where are the #American people?

3696 2018-05-28 16:35:47 Fuck the troops. The USA doesn’t fight for “freedom”. They want oil. Plain and simple. And they murder innocent people to get it!
3697 2018-05-28 16:35:45 This prices started dropping days ago. There’s a lag between crude oil prices falling and gasoline prices following. It takes time. If the trend continues you’ll see it at the pump.
3698 2018-05-28 16:35:45 The US wants control over the largest untapped oil reserves on the planet. Unfortunately, the Venezuelan govt wants to exploit those riches to improve the lives of its citizens - how dare they!!
3699 2018-05-28 16:35:39 try finding bagged instant soups without palm oil or some kinda beef/pork flavouring in it lmao even the veggie soups i like have that stuff in it please

3702 2018-05-28 16:35:12 how to heal ??

- get US out of east oil fields they prevent syrians to access to.
- get israel out of Golan gas fields , which they illegally keep for greedy billionaires

et voila

3705 2018-05-28 16:34:35 Wen oil trade, sir?
3706 2018-05-28 16:34:28 Nothing will be done. The West is drunk with Russian gas, oil, money perpetuating xenophobia, racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. For lasting peace, #Russia must cease to exist and follow the Soviet Union into oblivion

3711 2018-05-28 16:33:17 Your warfare isn’t average because your oil isn’t average
3712 2018-05-28 16:33:11 you do know that there's so much oil within the borders of the UNITED STATES that we could, if we truly wanted to, pump our own and regulate our own prices.  And you are away that CA put almost a buck a gallon tax right?

3720 2018-05-28 16:32:01 Lolzzzz my last tweet cuz I’m in Walmart and Beard oil right next me in the personal care isle
3721 2018-05-28 16:31:57 The prices have come down today, the crude oil has already been bought earlier at higher rates. So the end product price fall will also take gradually.
3722 2018-05-28 16:31:27 @MyRi_F_BaBy Great plan!  Have you taken care of the oil change?
3723 2018-05-28 16:31:09 One day I’ll be in Walmart buying my man beard oil

3726 2018-05-28 16:30:45 Oil prices have been rising for 15 days. The center & state are in the game of liability. Common people like us are suffering..

3733 2018-05-28 16:30:19 It’s not bad if you griddle it. Just use enough oil and seasoning and make the slices thick enough.
3734 2018-05-28 16:30:00 ٢
3735 2018-05-28 16:29:47 I hate coming to get oil changes, I just be saying yes to everything cause idk if I need it or not smh lol.
3736 2018-05-28 16:29:42 @CornblumSarah Sorry to hear that! Have you taken care of the oil change?
3737 2018-05-28 16:29:41 I need a oil change
3738 2018-05-28 16:29:33 Quite the commentary on what our foreign policy was like under Obama...  We actually projected weakness!
3739 2018-05-28 16:29:30 smoke CBD oil and literally never have that ever again.
3740 2018-05-28 16:29:24 First, you are wrong on your facts. Second, even if you were correct, that is nothing compared to how much defense contractors, Casino owners, oil companies, Etc give to politicians for the trillion-dollar tax cut , Etc
3741 2018-05-28 16:29:18 throw the veg in a pan with some oil and spices and make a stir fry! that’s my fav easy way to get rid of a lot of veg at once, and it’s also low carb
3742 2018-05-28 16:29:08 Anyone got some tanning oil I’m tryna get nice and toasty
3743 2018-05-28 16:29:06 I thought we bought too much oil from the Saudis as it is? You guys gotta get your lines straight.

And unfortunately nothing has been done for the average working person. Wages are still growing sluggishly and the tax cut was a bust. 

The right has been bought and sold.
3744 2018-05-28 16:29:03 problem? gas lighting is always welcome. It seems much better than electricity by burning oil.
3745 2018-05-28 16:29:02 @sushantsareen" Among the patent falsehoods uttered by Durrani "Institutionally, the military in Pakistan is not anti-India" and that: "it isn't true that Pakistan's Afghan policy is India-centric." Anyone who buys this snake oil will probably also believe that elephants can fly!
3746 2018-05-28 16:28:48 For those of y’all with thick thighs put Shea butter baby oil on your legs. They will just glide all day and it smells good 
3747 2018-05-28 16:28:47 And a ban on these products affect the oil industry as well. Clean up the environment.   Love it. Make it happen in Canada as well @JustinTrudeau
3748 2018-05-28 16:28:46 I make one comment about how oil dripping from cars is a good reason to go electric, and now you’re an expert on whether or not Canadians buy, what percentage, what range I would get...do you honestly believe that you’re going to change my initial argument? Or are you just bored

3754 2018-05-28 16:28:11 Why do you keep cod liver oil in the kitchen, next to olive oil?
3755 2018-05-28 16:28:03 always seems to happen, I get elbows deep in grease and oil, working on the bike, and then my nose itches...
3756 2018-05-28 16:27:51 Forgot my oil...
3757 2018-05-28 16:27:48 Russian and the Saudi started pumping more oil to protect trump for weapons and sanctions removal.
3758 2018-05-28 16:27:41 @alertpune  pl. u/s crude oil price nothing to do with fuel price in India.but ofcourse it's base.oil companies dictating.
3759 2018-05-28 16:27:39 @McVities any chance you could eliminate palm oil from your production line?  Hate to see this on ingredients lists.
3760 2018-05-28 16:27:37 I agree, we're going to 75.25 in the short term me thinks.  Also look at the oil price decline, which will add pressure as well
3761 2018-05-28 16:27:25 But we can avoid the future debt by not sending soldiers into asinine wars for no reason other than pride or oil...
3762 2018-05-28 16:27:21 It is time Israel withdrew from the illegally occupied Golan Heights and repay Syria for the oil and water stolen from this region.
3763 2018-05-28 16:27:16 Mane that oil is different, 
3764 2018-05-28 16:27:06 Great day diving the oil rigs on the Magician
3765 2018-05-28 16:27:00 Oil has to do with everything buddy. It tends to have a ripple effect on many levies.
3766 2018-05-28 16:26:58 If petrol prices are dependent on crude oil prices, then why didn't the prices fell when crude oil was 40$ per barrel?
3767 2018-05-28 16:26:49 Won’t cure oil based @CFDMedia containments! Play in lab  fill the trial correctly on who jury vs not legally allowed to build for i ©® in organic chemistry class UIC outlaws are afraid! Burn top of water to determine its value. Must break apart on arrival to sea water.
3768 2018-05-28 16:26:48 We object to subsidizing oil. And corn. And pretty much everything. 
Or put simply, we object to cronyism in practice - and don’t pick what cronies we like or don’t.
3769 2018-05-28 16:26:46 Y’all hoes be built Ford tough wit no oil change & think a nigga suppose to treat you lik a Benz
3770 2018-05-28 16:26:42 Watch the video u made for the last game of the season 3 years back.. Stoke 6 LFC 1.... U will be over the moon as to what we achieved in such a short time. That too without Oil money or Any Money for that matter.
3771 2018-05-28 16:26:33 No bragging or self promotion? No making it all about you instead of the brave people who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country? Oh, that's right you're a real leader, nothing like the snake oil salesman who currently occupies the White House.
3772 2018-05-28 16:26:32 Tragedy struck me last night, my pen battery was NOT heating up the oil. I prepared snacks and everything 
3773 2018-05-28 16:26:28 I call bullsh.... this bitumen has no market. Dirtiest oil on the planet.
3774 2018-05-28 16:26:25 Don’t understand how I managed to lose an entire jar of cocoanut oil
3775 2018-05-28 16:26:23 I get asked sometimes what beard oil I use. I don't use any! An unnecessary expense. I shampoo it with the same shampoo I use on my head and comb it. Simple as that. Hispters and their beard oil lol.
3776 2018-05-28 16:26:02 I've outdone myself today. I had the heat on under the wrong pot. Smelled burning and burnt two fingers because I decided to touch the ring to see if it was on. I need more cod liver oil
3777 2018-05-28 16:25:33 if you go all natural just be careful because things like tea tree oil will have a drying affect on your skin. it’s great for spot treatments but it’s so thick and heavy it dries out the skin. know your skin type before you put natural products on your face they can harm too
3778 2018-05-28 16:25:29 Who knows how to change oil!! I will pay youuu
3779 2018-05-28 16:25:28 VITAMIN E OIL ASAP GO TO WALGREENS
3780 2018-05-28 16:25:13 Refreshing to see. However,  u will be the assbags that run & dictate shit in politics just like oil & gas are now. It'll turn to deep pockets & scratch my back kind of shit. Your industry will be corrupted at the consumers cost, planet or not. That's the nature of a corporation
3781 2018-05-28 16:25:11 In April, Iran shipped a recent record of 91 million barrels of crude oil, worth roughly $6B. Of that, 1 million barrels was a delivery to Syria. Will Iran resume such deliveries to Syria once sanctions are in full effect by mid-November? #OOTT
3782 2018-05-28 16:25:10 Very few are on the same level with that misogynistic charlatan. He’s a snake oil salesman wrapped in a cheap suit. Go read your bible about false prophets and free your mind.

3786 2018-05-28 16:24:47 Agree. I met a older man from Venezuela here in Miami. He says that before Chavez the rich were corrupt, disdained the poor. Ruling class never used the oil bonanza to massively lift the poor class. Stole galore. He says that left the door open for the devil Chavez.

Stir-fry in a pan with a couple tablespoons of light oil. Stir ocassionaly, maybe 20 min over a medium heat. Put on top of rice. Enjoy.
3791 2018-05-28 16:24:12 Eh hem! Well, pretty uninformed on local debt. Politicians spend time taking about agency inefficiency on local level. State Constitution requires bal. budget ea. yr.

3800 2018-05-28 16:23:15 Oil control, but I’ve learned to to somewhat control it.
3801 2018-05-28 16:23:10 ever thought if US had a role to play to effect indian politics by controlling oil extraction and thus oil prices? 
A very good deception point?
3802 2018-05-28 16:23:07 Be right right back, I’m going to go dump 0.629 of a barrel of oil all over your bed. I’d like to see how long it takes you to clean up. 

I’d be a snowflake if I were offended; I just feel bad for you.
3803 2018-05-28 16:22:46 That's it, I'm making fried squash today, frick it, live life on the edge and fry some veggies. I don't give a fuh anymore, flippin' watch me son, I ain't even worried about it! You can't handle that, then get the heck out cuz that oil will be poppin'
3804 2018-05-28 16:22:45 And oil prices are down another 1.5% in Memorial Day trading overseas. Rooting for higher gas prices to win an election instead of actually coming up with a viable economic plan is bad enough. But it’s also betting on a horse you can’t control. - Jake Novak
3805 2018-05-28 16:22:40 The United States has always supported Israel and Saudi Arabia (where we established the oil industty). There's no real change here.

Trump sometimes supports Russia and many times opposes it.

3808 2018-05-28 16:22:22 It is not listing in exchange which is already there. This is futures trading in oil. Will bring in speculative element into retail prices of oil products.
3809 2018-05-28 16:22:20 Baku became the cosmopolitan city after oil boom after middle of 19th century and many workers, including iranian turks, armenian, Ukrainians and russian from the region immigrated for getting a job at the industry centers and factories in Baku.

3812 2018-05-28 16:22:01 Question for Snake Oil Salesman John Brennan. You and John Kerry have the same long face, why? He would never answer so I think he knows his goose is cooked and he is looking at possible prison time. He and Kerry could share a stall in the Deep State Obama stable Hillary too.
3813 2018-05-28 16:21:50 olive oil good for dogs?? i just learned this
3814 2018-05-28 16:21:36 First of all, what "failed policy" are you talking about? Do you know anything about my country at all, or are you just talking out of your ass?
Second, we are actually a net exporter of oil, unlike the USA, who imported about 3.7 million barrels per day through all of 2017.
3815 2018-05-28 16:21:32 Maybe you asking ur boss modi to reduce oil prices 
3816 2018-05-28 16:21:24 That charcoal, magnesium, shea, coconut, tea tree oil combo fye tho!
3817 2018-05-28 16:21:23 The #UjjwalaYojana is not a free scheme. All 'beneficiary' households must pay Rs 700-800 per gas cylinder. As a result, no family is buying refills. #IndiaInc corporates and individuals who gave up gas subsidy should know it was a ruse to benefit oil companies #FuelPriceHike
3818 2018-05-28 16:21:08 Their entire economy relies on the North Sea continuing to pump oil for refining into eUK refineries. No oil no cars and lorries.
3819 2018-05-28 16:21:03 You all change your engine oil yet?
3820 2018-05-28 16:20:56 Same!

Rösti, red onion, orange bell pepper, peas.

Mixed the rösti with olive oil, salt, garlic and onion powder, red pepper powder, mix, fry, slowly add veggies
3821 2018-05-28 16:20:36 Might want to focus on Trump first! Not sure I believe that he is anti-semitic - just pissed at the corporate owned and oil/gas obligated press!
3822 2018-05-28 16:20:30 Eugh, just noticed the sensor oil spots :(
3823 2018-05-28 16:20:30 If the crude oil price continues to be at this level, don't you think present government will also face inflationary pressures?
3824 2018-05-28 16:20:26 Gas prices soar Memorial Day weekend...

3828 2018-05-28 16:20:06 We have one and LOVE it! Great for wings, meatballs, salmon, etc! I use mine once a week. No oil needed! #Healthy
3829 2018-05-28 16:19:55 @LoblawsON @ProvigoQc Maybe you should stop using products with Palm oil such as the margarine I just bought... Aren't you aware ??? Peut-être devriez-vous cesser de vendre des produits avec de l'huile de palme n'êtes pour pas sensibilisé ? #PalmOil #Orangutan #ourangoutang
3830 2018-05-28 16:19:53 Bagus bgt tp sayang ada peppermint oil+talc nya which means dia irritating dan clogged pores nga bisa dipake terus2an gt untuk bertaun2 krn bisa ngerusak skin barrier
3831 2018-05-28 16:19:51 I've never seen that oil before? GTX Ultra-Clean? Is that Semi-Synthetic like magnetec?
3832 2018-05-28 16:19:50 Imagin dating a person who calls Cooking oil     Ati salad
3833 2018-05-28 16:19:46 ありがとう～(´・ω・｀)うれしい！
3834 2018-05-28 16:19:32 leaving baby oil on your skin for like half an hour before you shower seems to make it come off easier for me! xx
3835 2018-05-28 16:19:31 His claim is that they were bought off by oil companies. No proof, just speculation, just what he says he wants to combat. He’s a fox in the henhouse.
3836 2018-05-28 16:19:31 Yeah bro the Mercedes Dealership left my oil and break fluid caps off, I didn’t notice for months smh. Now I check after anything someone does to my babies!

3838 2018-05-28 16:19:20 The contrast between the real gravitas of 44 and the snake oil salesman act of 45 is really breathtaking today.
3839 2018-05-28 16:19:17 Sauces used:  oyster sauce for the noodles,  seseame oil,  dark sky sauce. Add some chopped spring onion. You can eat the noodles w/ the wonton soup and make some vinegar sauce for the dumplings for it to be 'proper' but we didn't lol

3847 2018-05-28 16:17:52 yes DAD I checked the oil in my car already!!!
me 10 minutes later: *runs out to check oil because I damn well didn’t check it.*
3848 2018-05-28 16:17:37 Partly. There are other factors at play that people seem to just ignore. Fact is the oil prices all over the world have been on the rise. Fact is we where hit by severe droughts and all of this needs to be considered.
3849 2018-05-28 16:17:25 NM does not fund schools thru property tax, but with a combination of general fund and a permanent fund that gets $$ from extraction industries (oil, gas, coal, etc). Maybe other states should look at more equitable funding than property taxes?
3850 2018-05-28 16:17:25 Fuck Memorial Day. What use is it honoring soldiers who, for the past 16 years, have done nothing but kill Arab/Afghani civilians and loot for oil/opium farming?

No wonder everyone in the world hates this country
3851 2018-05-28 16:17:24 Nig faced drastic drop in oil price, cut in productn of oil by over 50%, no savings, declinin reserves dat couldn't support 1month of Import & failing States of d federatn who couldn't meet salary obligations. Did u say ther was a policy dat cld hav saved us? @obyezeks @fkeyamo
3852 2018-05-28 16:17:24 O. Ngayong summer puro ako puyat. Hindi ako tinubuan ng pimples hahahaha. Pero kamusta naman ang oil? Kuha kang chicken magprito ka na.

3854 2018-05-28 16:17:19 เปลี่ยนแนวลงสีใหม่จากลงสีคร่าวๆแล้วใช้oil เกลี่ยเป็นลงสีแบบเต็มๆดีมั้ยนะ เผื่อภาพจะดูสดใสขึ้น
3855 2018-05-28 16:17:11 they have been taking our heavy oil and heavy oil from Venezuela for 20 years at least
3856 2018-05-28 16:17:05 then you are voting for more of the same. more wars, oil, removing rights, survelliance, corporate profits, drone murder, hate from abroad, less education, more poverty, increased civil disobediance, violance, propaganda, covert ops, etc.
3857 2018-05-28 16:17:04 car is Nissan from Sunderland my Gin British my whisky Scottish I don’t drink Vodka Italians wouldn’t recognise my pizza my oil is North Sea
3858 2018-05-28 16:17:04 How will you fuel your rUK economy when the North Sea oil taps are turned off to refineries in rUK. No cars, lorries etc etc.
3859 2018-05-28 16:16:52 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about probiotic rosé and dry brushing. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.
3860 2018-05-28 16:16:52 Oil control, dry in certain areas, huge pores
3861 2018-05-28 16:16:40 -rl maaf salpak. mending kleveru ricebran oil or sunflower seed oil?
3862 2018-05-28 16:16:27 ... make sure you add seseame oil with it. According to Mother xD. Once made we boil in water w/ chicken stock cube. 

Noodles
Pre-bought (takes hours to make) but you blanche it boiling water,  then rinse in cold water. You do this twice to cook it and not make it soggy.

3864 2018-05-28 16:16:01 #KinderMorgan #Pipeline 

SAD FACTS:

1. @AJWVictoriaBC of the @BCGreens is holding the minority #NDP government @jjhorgan hostage.
2. BC is using oil & gas from Saudia Arabia not Alberta
3. @JustinTrudeau rigged the process to fast-track the pipeline which failed.
3865 2018-05-28 16:15:40 I was pretty skeptical about using solely coconut oil as my face cleanser/moisturizer but the pimple on my chin has actually decreased in size and pain since trying for the first time last night
3866 2018-05-28 16:15:39 See Connor Lamb in PA.
3867 2018-05-28 16:15:28 I don't know any more about working on an oil rig now than I did then lol

3870 2018-05-28 16:15:17 Good thing the conservatives put all that money away while the price of oil was high to weather us through this storm... oh wait.
3871 2018-05-28 16:15:16 Gotta go with the Oil! Get nice and crispy

3874 2018-05-28 16:14:56 Think of how many of the brave are dead because politicians abused the soldier’s patriotism to send them to fight and die over money and oil and to allow leaders to look tough. Let’s hope that in the future we only fight when our nation is truly at risk.
3875 2018-05-28 16:14:55 Who here has tried the oil facial cleanse? And does it work?
3876 2018-05-28 16:14:51 ok really not sure what @brookllewis and i we’re thinking yesterday w all that damn tanning oil and instant bronzer! BURTN AF

3878 2018-05-28 16:14:25 My car need an oil change and this is where having a boyfriend would come in handy
3879 2018-05-28 16:14:11 I'm not anti oil. I use more oil than the average Canadian.

My issue is having this oil terminate in the coastal waters of Vancouver. Tanker traffic is already an issue. I see it everyday.

Let's ship it from a location with way less traffic.
3880 2018-05-28 16:14:06 And the non sequitur award goes to...

3882 2018-05-28 16:13:28 Got to that stage where I’m using bio oil as a precaution cuz my days of maintaining what very little youth or “beauty” I have left in my body are numbered  #latetwentiesapproachingfast
3883 2018-05-28 16:13:14 My hair LOVES argan oil
3884 2018-05-28 16:13:14 Look at the whole picture though.

1) Gives the 1% a windfall tax deduction
2) Destabilizes the middle east knowing it would effect oil prices
3) Blames oil prices on Iran
4) 1% who owns oil companies rakes in more cash
5) American's suffer
3885 2018-05-28 16:13:14 Oh I think I know the stuff, smells like lamp oil and it's basically 90% alcohol or is that another one

3889 2018-05-28 16:13:04 No. True, we saw NK failed, yes, I read the article, but that doesn’t mean that Clinton’s deal was a good one. It doesn’t mean we didn’t give them oil and money, and they didn’t try. The obviously succeeded and we were left in the losing end.
3890 2018-05-28 16:12:51 Sadly, it contains palm oil & rapeseed, which alone would ensure it'd never, ever darken my door. Add in the 'low fat' cocoa & sugar & it's all just worse. This stuff is sincerely very bad for you! It's not hard to make your own though, with human & orangutan friendly stuff :)
3891 2018-05-28 16:12:28 I do a really great impression of Anakin at his mom’s grave “I miss you Mom. SO. MUCH.”
3892 2018-05-28 16:12:26 Where do you think the money is going? Municipalities? Gas prices up all over the world. My God you obviously don’t work in the Oil and Gas sector! And if you do, wow
3893 2018-05-28 16:12:20 Is FX the singular determinant of economic growth? It is a lazy and intellectually defective argument that only indicates our heavy reliance on oil.

3896 2018-05-28 16:12:08 In Iraq we were fighting for oil.   In Afghanistan we fight for semi conductor materials.  In Syria we fight for a pipeline.  In Libya for the world banking system.
3897 2018-05-28 16:12:07 Why this man infront me in the bank line smelling like pitch oil 
3898 2018-05-28 16:12:07 Oil price hike. Again. #habapila
3899 2018-05-28 16:12:06 Are you sure it's allergies and not pollution from the oil & gas industry, which kills thousands of Canadians every year?
3900 2018-05-28 16:12:06 @realDonaldTrump stop fuckin playing with the oil NIGGA
3901 2018-05-28 16:11:59 Does that mean that in the face of this ignorance of the facts, you are boldly proclaiming that Chia had strong offers for Ebs that he, and the entire Oil mgt group, passed on?  Do you really think experienced people are that stupid & online chatters with no facts are smarter?
3902 2018-05-28 16:11:57 Oil dropped 10% in price this weekend thanks to the Saudis.  It will take about 6-8 weeks to cycle through so we can see it at the gas pumps but it’s coming!!  If Republicans concentrate on what has been done for the average working American they should do just fine in November!
3903 2018-05-28 16:11:56 Sir, in view of the ground-truths for last 3 decades including the PM's 10% call, I suggest the theme "Attacking the Plaguing Plateau of India's Oil Production" be considered for the forthcoming Petrotech. Regards.

3906 2018-05-28 16:11:28 This summer I’m learning new recipes & how to change my own oil
3907 2018-05-28 16:11:24 Of course they would. 

Why anyone still believes these snake oil salesmen though is anyone's guess.
3908 2018-05-28 16:11:24 Oh we have soo much untapped, their are Canadian owners, mostly junior companies, still would profit on the foreign oil like they do now with royalties , we also have farming, animals and grain, we would do quite well actually, have been working on this for 15 yrs, catch up
3909 2018-05-28 16:11:20 Yes!!! Just make sure u dilute it with water because it’s very strong and could burn ur skin. I just get a q-tip wet and then put tea tree oil on it. I do it twice a day until it’s gone
3910 2018-05-28 16:11:07 He was referring to oil companies and lobbyists
3911 2018-05-28 16:11:04 Dear RandipSinghSurjewala ji
Why don't you reduce oil prices in Punjab, Karnataka and one other State where your Party notorious for Scams on daily basis, has Governments ...
Set an example and tell BJP....
U ve done it ..!!
3912 2018-05-28 16:10:57 Copper smelting is only small part of Vedanta business. They r leaders with no issues in other biz (crude oil, zinc, aluminum)

3914 2018-05-28 16:10:41 Abi, wit lot of capital projects on going tru out d country even at crude oil per barrel below $100.n PDP 16yrs can't do 1/2

3916 2018-05-28 16:10:37 Light rail is replaced by long, angled teeter totters that swap you to the next one forward with each up-down cycle. From a distance it looks like a field of oil derricks. There's a lot of laughter and whooping, although some people are angry about the change. #dream
3917 2018-05-28 16:10:22 So when exactly is it 'your' problem? When the country has shit tons of oil?
And I don't think Reuters is asking *you* to fix the problem anyway.
3918 2018-05-28 16:10:21 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
3919 2018-05-28 16:10:09 Yes and no. Rate of loss is too high. Anything above 5lbs, tbf isn't advisable. You can't choose to 'lose the oil' only in any weight loss. You can retain muscle mass in a cut, yes. To build, not gonna happen.
3920 2018-05-28 16:10:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3921 2018-05-28 16:09:51 Heh. I don't know what the official food of Texas is, but I'm sure it's fried in oil.
3922 2018-05-28 16:09:46 People have said?
Some people are saying?

Do you ever use actual facts or evidence, #PresidentHissyFit?

Because these are the tactics if faux newspeak fraudcasting spewing doublethink to their viewers 24/7

You're a liar & a conman
A snake oil salesmen fooling only the rubes.
3923 2018-05-28 16:09:46 When I come down off that oil, I’m nonchalant on you whores
3924 2018-05-28 16:09:33 Mak aih..sedar x sedar kereta aku dah kene tukar gear oil dah next service..ok bukan cvtf biasa tapi cvtf hc-2..jangan salah minyak kalau x barai gearbox..
3925 2018-05-28 16:09:21 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
3926 2018-05-28 16:09:20 I RISE and okay I was skeptical about coconut oil at first but instead of using it as a lotion I used it when I shaved my legs and now I am not oily I'm SO SMOOTH
3927 2018-05-28 16:09:05 Ok Kritika I'm watching as usual.I think it an act of gaining popularity at cost of public in a sense everything u require high from 400% salary hike to oil tax & several tax on one person but those saving lives are forced to earn peanut.Pvt.runs on need or it blank so injustice
3928 2018-05-28 16:08:57 New scents.  85ml 20%oil based perfume (no water content) it last up to 12 hours. No need expensive perfumes! You can afford perfumes same scent as branded perfumes. Bibili ka pa ba ng expensive perfumes kung makakabili ka na sa halang 250 pesos?  

Pm for orders.  
3929 2018-05-28 16:08:50 And pledge to them, that they will never have to kill others in order to preserve our precious, precious oil fields.

3931 2018-05-28 16:08:29 Watching a YouTube video about  CBD oil and doing my nails 
3932 2018-05-28 16:08:21 i know a 95yr grandma she's living alone and independent. I bet in her times they ate everything from real meat cheese butter fried food and chocolate... and she's just fine now. I think 1-we are all dying anyway 2-if we have bad genes we're screwed anyway 3-just seize the day
3933 2018-05-28 16:08:20 R.D. I just took it a few minutes ago myself.. I hope it's gets passed up and down twitter.. 
3934 2018-05-28 16:08:08 Your an idiot. Welcome to summer time when supply and demand change. Plus cost of crude oil has risen... Don't know much about economics do you???
3935 2018-05-28 16:08:04 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @ArvindKejriwal expert said cng rate maximum 20 RS kilo.there is no link crud oil and international market  sir plzz jeeno do middle class and petrol aur disel ki car to Chala nahi sakta Kam se Kam cng per reham karo

Whether they are instructed, blackmailed or bribed i cannot say.

I do know that the 'Oil for Immigration' act doesn't sound like a conspiracy theory any more.
3939 2018-05-28 16:07:33 I live off of CBD oil and salt during my period
3940 2018-05-28 16:07:26 If wine is made only from grapes, and olive oil come out of the presses.

I hope you understand.   
3941 2018-05-28 16:07:24 The rate of loss & also what is lost. Most of the time when people go for diets, it’s mostly water loss. Gotta make sure you lose the oil & build the muscles to get good results.
3942 2018-05-28 16:07:20 A lot of these skin product/hair product/beard oil businesses are also missing the appropriate papers...

3945 2018-05-28 16:06:58 Madam was asked the country that can be used as example aside Venezuela , madam was listed Russia&Angola. @fkeyamo you should have asked her that do Nigeria, Russia&Angola run the same economy policy viz-a-viz dependency on oil?   &   are almost similar in that regard
3946 2018-05-28 16:06:51 You should check him out, he’s as much of a bigot and a snake oil salesman as you appear to be.
3947 2018-05-28 16:06:47 Never moisturize your face with an oil based product.
3948 2018-05-28 16:06:27 I don’t believe you know if it did or did not. It is clear we sent NK oil. It is clear they continued to build their reactors. It was a fail. Bush had to fix it. I will believe Washington Post before I believe what you say is true.

3952 2018-05-28 16:06:00 Es un poquito naive –o idealista, o de plano mentira— eso de creer que el Estado deba ser un ente administrativo o árbitro imparcial entre las distintas fuerzas de un país. La neutralidad no existe ni la política ni el la literatura. Siempre habrá visión y con ello agenda.
3953 2018-05-28 16:06:00 Castor oil yoh and it is  smells so bad

3956 2018-05-28 16:05:43 Depends on which type of fats, there are healthy fats that we consume to help burn those unhealthy saturated fats. Example will be fish oil, avocado, coconut oil & even peanut butter...
3957 2018-05-28 16:05:42 Make no mistake there will be people who were and possibly still are in government who will be on these lists! The reason for the blackout goes far deeper than Islam! Tommy nearly hit oil and the proverbial plug was well and truly put in!
3958 2018-05-28 16:05:34 Look at who told you the oil was running out. Read the GCR. It says oil is a bonus. There is at least 30 years of oil revenue left. The tories have a 0% corporation deal set up with the oil companies. They want you to think this way. Please wake up. They want Scot to look poor.
3959 2018-05-28 16:05:27 Agree up to a point - teachers do need to fight technology that doesn't lead to better learning. There's a lot of money to be made from selling digital snake oil to schools, and tech companies know it
3960 2018-05-28 16:05:25 I would roast it with some oil & Chinese or Indian spices and serve with dahl & rice 
3961 2018-05-28 16:05:15 Midland is up and coming with oil and gas production but must diversify in cultural, population, and job, biz opportunities. Odessa near Midland also affected by oil and gas must add diversity in same as Midland. Counties around these 2 cities will populate & increase in value 2.

3969 2018-05-28 16:04:42 (Dad once said they deplaned in Indonesia after he did some training at an oil camp when the engine was off and the pilot looked at him and said, "Well you're an engineer grab a wrench too.")

3974 2018-05-28 16:04:09 Not necessarly. You can ask of the seller to put the amount in escrow until delivery and ask for a readjustment of that escrowed amount to match the market price of the oïl. So if no delivery you can just go buy it on the open market. Another way is to use insurance.
3975 2018-05-28 16:04:03 Crude oil prices today are lower than when under Manmohan but fuel prices in India highest!
3976 2018-05-28 16:03:54 Sure, I was talking about oil, but go ahead, make me a list.
3977 2018-05-28 16:03:53 @dpradhanbjp sir u mentioned that the govt is working on long term plans on oil prices...by when can u say getting it under control...u hv been making excuses for past 15 days n the oil prices is at an all time high.dnt make mockery of us as v voted UPA out cz of this n voted BJP
3978 2018-05-28 16:03:43 Tips for doing your own manicure:

1. Soak cuticles 
2. Push back cuticles
3. Cut if necessary 
4. Cuticle oil and soak for 5 mins
5. Wash and use alcohol to cleanse
6. Paint base, 2 coats polish and top

Do not send them into harms way unless absolutely necessary. Iraq was not necessary. Neither is Syria. Let them kill themselves. Who cares!

3986 2018-05-28 16:02:43 Is there anything that Justin Trudeau & his Liberal misfits haven't screwed up?

Trudeau can't control the borders. 
Immigration is a disaster!
He is taxing us to death!
3987 2018-05-28 16:02:42 Hey I’m Lucca Cerminaro I’m 15 years old I saw your YouTube video of a security guard threating you and your friend at a oil company a few years ago I do have a YouTube channel. So I love your skateboarding video.
3988 2018-05-28 16:02:29 Craving boiled yam with palm oil and dried fish. You know when you heat up the roasted fish and then put it in the oil with salt and the heat from the fish melts the oil? Yeah. I’m going to look for yam, palm oil and dried fish to buy this night
3989 2018-05-28 16:02:13 Yeah but the effect is slow with tea tree oil . Maybe after the pimple calm down, I will go for the AHA or BHA again.

4007 2018-05-28 16:00:03 Nope. Oil price rebound to above $71 is the only reason for the small recovery we've seen. Bragging about not quite getting back to 2014 numbers is not something anyone should be proud of, especially while accumulating a mountain of debt our children will be paying for forever.

4016 2018-05-28 15:58:59 @cliffnationwide i like what Vegas expressed about employing critical thinking but Vegas must understand that religion and critical thinking is like oil and water. The moment you do employ critical thinking religion becomes obsolete.

4033 2018-05-28 15:56:37 I suspect that the #FakeGovernment will push offshore oil drilling through. If that happens, it should be mandatory that all oil remain in the US and not be exported anywhere! After the damage caused by fracking, the oil companies are exporting it causing US gas prices to rise.

4055 2018-05-28 15:54:09 The all or nothing fallacy assumes that things must be completely one way or another.

In other words, we can continue to use oil, while at the same time advocate for using it less, more responsibly, and have those who profit from it also pay to clean up spills.

4085 2018-05-28 15:51:19 Ofcourse not, it comes at the price of oil and near 50% of our taxes.

But no one knows how dilbit will act in seawater and I think that trading more than half of BC’s jobs and economy is not a fair trade for a few jobs in Alberta
4089 2018-05-28 15:51:02 Who’s trying to go to the beach after I’m done changing my oil

4091 2018-05-28 15:50:56 Yes it will also serve the purpose of a shock absorber for the bumps in International crude oil prices.
4092 2018-05-28 15:50:52 tetep setelah essence. karna face oil konsistensinya lebih kental dari essence. ibarat kalo face oil dulu, baru essence, ntar essence nya susah nyerep

4096 2018-05-28 15:50:29 During the congress the hike was due to the increase in the crude oil prices....Petrol and deisel prices were high all over the world.... but it is not the same case now.

4101 2018-05-28 15:50:11 I had gotten gas in boonville and had my card then. I got an oil change in como & my card was no where to be found. Well I realized I never put it back in my wallet & probably threw it in the trash. I went all the way back to boonville to dig in some trash....
4102 2018-05-28 15:49:58 makes sense to remember people who died for some oil... sry i mean to protect a nation and a constitution halway across da world #MemorialDay #GoUSA

4107 2018-05-28 15:49:15 They were just lucky! The plan was imperfect and the logistics of supplying criminal. "An army, like a serpent, goes upon its belly,” Frederic of Prussia said and tanks on their fuel Rommel added. The Germans had to risk Stalingrad at any cost since they were running out of oil!
4108 2018-05-28 15:49:12 ok, he didn't, which is kinda human. As much as I don't like the tone and the medium of this drum pounding, it's clear that EM is frustrated by the amount of mis/disinformation about Tesla. As a journo, do you really think there is no effort of fighting oil disruption?

Sorry Hey Raj..
Looks like u are hanging off the edge of to the petrol/diesel oil price on the graph.

By the way since u profess so much concern on fuel price hike and batting for ordinary citizens ... wud u care to share what’s ur typical monthly fuel bill ??
4114 2018-05-28 15:48:09 1 small onion, 1/2 each of red and orange pepper, about 10 cherry tomatoes, 4 large eggs, mixed in with sweet & smoked paprika. Onion into chunky half rings, peppers into strips, small amount of oil, permit some browning. Add tomatoes for a few mins, add egg mix, add lid.
4115 2018-05-28 15:48:01 Dtg umah sbb nak argan oil. Hahaha

4117 2018-05-28 15:47:45 Diamonds are controlled, globally, by a single company: DeBeers. They will undercut any potential competition for decades, effectively killing it. Oil company execs know this. They would love to have similar control over their commodity. Retail oil price isn't going to go down.
4118 2018-05-28 15:47:37 I am presuming you understand the block grant, the tax raised in Scotland,  the oil corporation tax deal the Scottish exports classed as UK! When we are independent we can sort everyone out.
4119 2018-05-28 15:47:34 If would support alternative power , we would not need the oil 
4120 2018-05-28 15:47:28 Your welcome 
4121 2018-05-28 15:47:24 A lot of those guys in the system are like vultures waiting for this to come to pass and still feast on these funds.

Oil and Gas sector is a reference. Despite increment in Pump Price, the subsidy also increased astronomically. Without accountability!
4122 2018-05-28 15:47:17 Pretty much all the problems were caused by oil in enriching theocracies and enabling them to pursue their political dogma. Forget global warming, worry about arming hateful ideologues. Stop buying Iranian oil complety, starve them of funding, get a decent agreement.
4123 2018-05-28 15:47:00 Desi food isn't something you should be eating if you're trying to stay healthy. The amount of red paper, oil and spices we use is absurd and lemme tell you everything in Pakistan is fake, red paper is made of bricks with ruins your insides
4124 2018-05-28 15:46:59 Should I be able to deduct the portion of my taxes which goes to giveaways and incentives to oil companies? You don't believe in collective initiative - I do. Not much point in trolling each other.

4126 2018-05-28 15:46:52 2023 the period of the treaty ends , which has passed a hundred years & here we understand Erdogan ‘s comments, as Turkey will enter a new era, and will begin oil exploration and drilling a new channel linking between the two seas Black and Marmara and collecting taxes on ships.

4140 2018-05-28 15:45:25 Gas goes up on Thursday 40 cents no matter what crude does. There is more oil being pumped out of the U.S. than we are buying. But it doesn't help us, the consumer. 
Remember one year after Katrina?
Gas went to over 5 dollars a gallon on the forecast a bigger hurricane was likely

4146 2018-05-28 15:44:44 For us to fully unlock our Economic potential as a nation, Our citizens must have purchasing power. They must have Money to spend. You cannot diversify from oil to things like Sport and entertainment when people don't have food at home. Impossible

4175 2018-05-28 15:41:12 @OnPointPR_SA I'm listening to your program about the American Indian and I just want to say that showing them proper respect would be to stop forcing ourselves on their land as we are trying to do with oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The land is theirs.

4185 2018-05-28 15:40:07 These guys are a waste of time. Next he'll try to manipulate the convo to be that Alberta can refine that oil. But oh wait! If Alberta can, then why do we need the pipeline through BC; and why aren't we refining domestically?

They prefer to enrich foreign nations, at our expense
4186 2018-05-28 15:40:03 I still can't figure out what people mean when they say we are "due" for a recession. Recessions aren't like oil changes.

4200 2018-05-28 15:38:54 Nice quote @RealCandaceO the media is selling us snake oil, and if we continue to consume it will indeed kill our culture
4201 2018-05-28 15:38:44 99% sure he was on about businesses since he was going on some rant about all the media being paid off by oil and gas companies a few days ago. It fits the whole persona he likes to project about being a "lone wolf up against the world" that his cult loves.

4235 2018-05-28 15:34:20 He is not my president and I have never said that. He, in his own words, proclaims that he is not our president. The snake oil salesman is only for his teeny tiny base and Russian bots, who somehow believe he cares.

4273 2018-05-28 15:30:26 2- were sold to the public as protecting our nation but were, in fact, ordered to protect the foreign economic interests of fruit growers, banks and oil corporations. More veterans are needed in Congress to better evaluate go or no go!
4274 2018-05-28 15:30:23 So world oil prices are a result of democratic gas taxes?  Really, that's what your going with?  You're more stupid than I originally gave you credit for....
4275 2018-05-28 15:30:22 after crushing the oil filter on my silverado trying to remove it i had to tap a philips through it to unscrew yesterday. was always aware of this method, but, have never had to do it b4. will pick up the pliers style filter removal tool for next time b/c things got messy

AR-15’s were not used in the military and are not used by any military anywhere in the world.
The AR stands for Armalite Rifle that’s the company that built them. The military uses the M-16 & the M-4. 
People need to get educated about the AR-15.
4280 2018-05-28 15:30:09 Heard this "Release the oil Over every Dead Place in your Life!" The Oil is Prayer,The Word of God, Your Worship & Your PRAISE!
4281 2018-05-28 15:30:04 I don’t know any.. Rules of Engagement?   Of course I do.  One of the worst was that we couldn’t kill any ISIS “drivers” of oil trucks funding ISIS, because they were “civilians?”  Hahaha!  LOL!  Please give me a break!  @cspanwj
4282 2018-05-28 15:30:00 These are good signings. It’s near impossible to sign 3-4 top defenders in a single window, especially if you’re not an oil rich club. Patch it up with low cost experienced players. Use funds on 1 class player and youth. Smart clubs don’t waste years of competing to rebuild.

4291 2018-05-28 15:28:36 I am not sure why markets are panicking so much on OPEC news, by the end of the year any oil they add will be a drop in the bucket. Between Venezuela and who knows on Iran! Could be tight supply.
4292 2018-05-28 15:28:16 Oops there goes oil. I hope Canada has diversified it's economy by now.
4293 2018-05-28 15:27:57 Amen. Dry rub is the way to go. I like to do a light coat or olive oil before I do the rub. Helps make them crispy on the gril.
4294 2018-05-28 15:27:50 1-Calendula oil is a great moisturizer n helps soothe the area and reduce the pain.
2-It works well on sprained muscles helps lessen swelling from injury.
3-It alsohelps relieve diaper rashes, which can  irritate an infant.

Caretaker ready?
4368 2018-05-28 15:18:41 No bloody idea have you?
If we re-apply, the ball would be in our court - EFTA, EEA, full membership, some hybrid of them all - we would negotiate.
We have HUGE fish stocks, Huge oil reserves, green energy, whisky, tourism, agricultural produce, etc, etc.
We would be an EU asset.

4394 2018-05-28 15:16:31 Motor tip: The oil filters for the 2013-2017 Suzuki Swift Sport will fit the Suzuki Swifts 2013-2017. The filter on the Swift Sport is slightly shorter than on the Swift, however, to clear the larger exhaust and axles on the Sport.
4395 2018-05-28 15:16:29 A year ago,recall for airbag on my car, so I went to @Lexus Pleasanton, after the airbag repair, they said something else is wrong and could cost almost $2k, took the car to my normal mechanic and he said nothing is wrong, would just fix oil filter. I could ve waste money.

4401 2018-05-28 15:15:50 Sorry, a what? “Strong, successful economy in England”?  When’s that likely to happen? Around the same time that the North Sea will run out of oil?
4402 2018-05-28 15:15:50 The claim should stand on its own and if Israel has oil (as it does) it will have businesses flocking for investment purposes. The bible speaks of the hook that will bring a massive war against Israel (for its spoils) & it labels those countries and of course God’s record is 100%
4403 2018-05-28 15:15:50 Because like Nigeria, Venezuela depends solely on oil and had no savings. His was a more accurate comparison. So you think we are comparable to Russia? Lol. Mama has played you

4415 2018-05-28 15:14:14 What these people don't seem to, or perhaps refuse to see is #guncontrol has two options, one where the Government controls the guns, thereby controlling the people.

4443 2018-05-28 15:10:58 India, second largest buyer of #Iran's #oil, says it will not follow US #sanctions. It is good news for #Iran only if India buys crude in euros for example. Last time round, Iran was forced to buy low quality Indian crop because it was paid in rupees.

4460 2018-05-28 15:09:31 Would reporting it as 100,000 ml make your anti oil agenda to transparent?  It’s 2/3 of one barrel stopped, container, and cleaned up.  Should be an example of Canada’s strict environmental standards.

4462 2018-05-28 15:09:16 That is true, all within the fence and contained. Likely to do with maintenance not a failure of equipment etc. Modern lines definitely the safest way to transport. Argue with the sources of oil but don’t harp on safety.

4464 2018-05-28 15:09:12 And the attempt by @SuzanneAnton et al to equate how good a Canadian you are with how strongly you support an oil pipeline is outrageous and anti-democratic. The history books will not be kind to you.

4467 2018-05-28 15:09:02 Stick to the facts: oil prices have come down, gas prices are up. This is more like the regular summer gouging.
4468 2018-05-28 15:08:58 What did he carry then? See, where I come to a crossroads is with these military grade weapons. I don't see a point in them being allowed for any regular citizen to have. I think the police and military should be allowed to use them because they're trained to do so.

Heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Cook (in batches not to crowd pan) 2-3 minutes per side. Enjoy!

4475 2018-05-28 15:07:33 I read it was only 100 liters. That's 5 of those blue water containers. Small so far as oil spills go 
4476 2018-05-28 15:07:23 But they do expect us to think and act like it is. I wasn't trying to argue I was just dropping info on what a seizure is. I experience seizures.

4500 2018-05-28 15:05:43 Wait, so you don't agree with him? I think he's being reasonable. Assault weapons shouldn't be available to the general population. My family owns rifles and hand guns and I'm all for the 2nd amendment but I do think assault weapons are unnecessary for the general population.

4572 2018-05-28 14:58:26 Our Honda CRV had the cover plate over the oil filter come off. Does this happen frequently?
4573 2018-05-28 14:58:23 It's not. The subsidy makes the cost cheaper than it is, the 'strike price' is artificially high (gov subsidy) and if left to market forces then Wind power is losing money.  Scotland share of oil is geographical not population. Tell me what's 100% of nothing?

@fordnation is offering snake oil to the people of Ontario. #onpoli
4618 2018-05-28 14:54:10 Wind is already a cheap source and getting more practice by the day.  Oil is volatile but 100% is better than a 8.4% share. And we could institute conditions as in Norway.
I'm relaxed.
4619 2018-05-28 14:53:49 I’d hesitate to say that cryptocurrency or smart contracts are snake oil intrinsically. Some are really cool projects with insane geopolitical implications. It just happens that a bunch of people got rich with the BTC or the ETH ICO and now people are trying to copy its success

4622 2018-05-28 14:53:17 @SecretaryDEA strange indeed! Oil prices have risen 100% since 2014 and the country doesn’t know where this revenue is being spent.

4625 2018-05-28 14:52:57 Not sure but I think in the taxcut law there is a clause that allows for oil drilling in Alaska when oil trades above $70 a bbl.
4626 2018-05-28 14:52:53 Even if you count Russians export their arms productions capacity is just 2 times of the Europeans.
And that assume their oil revenue will not get wiped out because Poles blow the “friendship” pipeline.
Nah Russo-Germanic wars just did not happening.

For instance it says it "protects against keys and knifes" when we all know that's really the tempur glass.

4641 2018-05-28 14:51:24 You need some Bacofoil. Oil/Gas reserves are only worth what they can be sold for. Wind energy needs big gov subsidy, good luck with that. Large Engineering almost dies the day MOD work moves south.

4648 2018-05-28 14:50:44 Mr President, you have given Saudi Arabia all they want with your actions against IRAN. A unintended consequence is oil shortage and rising prices. You should demand quid-pro-quo from Saudi. They must increase their output to make up for IRAN shortfall due to Your sanctions!!

Oil money buys good press, though

4663 2018-05-28 14:48:50 Yeah, but you used the very, very specific example of a hurricane. Like really specific. I mean, you know that the two causes for the oil spike are OPEC and Iran, right? Why do you guys always blame the liberal when you say something dumb

If you do not know oil or understand anything about oil you should not be trading oil or selling anything on oil.
4669 2018-05-28 14:48:06 Yeah. Going up hill at mile 24 was not appropriate!  Of course it was marginally better than running through the oil fields and industrial park!

4703 2018-05-28 14:43:44 but... apparently this guy has all the "hard data" that the oil industry doesn't have... apparently he knows better.  I say let BC get its oil shipped from the ocean from now on.. and then see if they like those oil leaks better.
4704 2018-05-28 14:43:39 How is Lucic's disastrous 17/18 relevant to Eberle?  Fact is that up to the time of the Eberle trade, Luc scored goals than Eb for Oil in 16/17, averaged about same over 4 yrs, & certainly brought a more complete gm & presence. Let's hope he recovers from 17/18.

4768 2018-05-28 14:36:15 I grew up on the Kalamazoo river in Battle Creek.  The Enbridge oil spill was a disaster.  However, Enbridge stepped up and made things right.  The Kalamazoo River is now the cleanest I’ve seen in 50 years.
4769 2018-05-28 14:36:06 The gas was used for lighting, so perhaps it was referring to saving oil for illumination?

I don't really know. But I know who I'm going to ask later this week.

4774 2018-05-28 14:35:50 No we would not. See Port of Vancouver’s fight to get back a paltry 500k in compensation from 2017 relatively “ minor” oil spill. 1 spill of bitumen oil would devastate BC coastline for decades.There is no trust in capabilities or accepting responsibility / cost of oil cleanup.

4778 2018-05-28 14:35:31 I'm followed by @WrestleTalk_TV and I talk about cod liver oil, of course I'm legit, why would anyone lie on the internet
4779 2018-05-28 14:35:29 At the time I lived in Ft Pierce Fl and saw oil tankers anchored off the coastline. Playing with the Arabs is a dangerous game but Trump knows nothing about our history. The embargo was real and we didn’t get the oil. BTW another Republican was president, Nixon.

4781 2018-05-28 14:35:25 It’s that fucking Mulch place in oil city and it doesn’t help that we surrounded by water so the tides don’t help
4782 2018-05-28 14:35:23 The helmet in the pub telling everyone that the company he runs is paying for his beer.
No.....you're self employed and work offshore.
Cunt couldn't run a bath when he was on shift now he's running a multi million pound oil company.
4783 2018-05-28 14:35:16 Stop or stoop?  Then there is the 'the fee'.  I didn't know that there was a fee but are you working on 'their feeble'?
4784 2018-05-28 14:35:14 Efficiency is not at all relevant. Oil furnace 92% efficient,  $100 in oil = $92 worth of heat. Solar at 22% efficient $0.00 for sunlight...  I paid off my house, then paid off my energy use. If you have the opportunity to install solar and you don’t - you’re not doing the math.

4787 2018-05-28 14:35:03 What can poor Modi do for oil price going past $100? The electorate will teach Congress a lesson in the General Elections--Congress will get more votes when RaGa keeps quiet. Problem of overkill.
4788 2018-05-28 14:34:49 I lived 38 years in an industrial area, which produced power, fertilizer, corrosive oil etc., (Neyveli) asthma, skin rashes, silicon content in water etc., what to do!? Do u want to close it!
4789 2018-05-28 14:34:37 "According to many"...isn't that Donald Trump's line? The leak was contained to the pumping station. No oil leaked into a body of water. So how are the salmon succumbing "to this disaster"? Good grief. Where did you get your information?

4795 2018-05-28 14:34:02 What?  US and Russia are among top oil producers. What next, whine about why petrol cheaper in Gulf countries than India? India is about in the middle of price chart. Doesn't seem a huge problem to me (and crude oil set to get cheaper anyway) so stop with whining.

I’m guessing this is what the Liberals tell them to report?

4802 2018-05-28 14:32:59 Ha, some '80s Volkswagens have a similar setup for their low oil pressure warning – just a relay oscillator attached to a sounding board to make it louder. That rattling buzz still gives me an instant STOP EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW reaction.
4803 2018-05-28 14:32:57 Mam but crude oil price fell down 10% in international market. But here is increasing rate today also. Modi akela bhi kya krega, uski team me strength ki kami hai
4804 2018-05-28 14:32:56 It was the day after he took all the guns away and the day before he stopped all oil and gas drilling.  Hell of a trifecta. (Oh wait, he did none of that).

4844 2018-05-28 14:29:37 Because Obama wouldn’t allow fracking. Fracking is a method of extracting oil from the ground and it’s much less expensive than traditional methods, therefore causing gas prices to go down. That’s why he said that.

4869 2018-05-28 14:26:23 And you are wrong as it pertains to ONGC. You can check their financials at the oil peak in 2013/14. You will see decent net profit figures - both ONGC and Gail are seen as strategically very crucial and therefore their debt raising ability has always been protected.

4953 2018-05-28 14:17:09 2/And this is a great example of how "pro oil people" think about spills. In this case, the leak was small and detection/containment systems acted as designed. I want pipeline systems to respond to every spill, of whatever size, just as they were designed.

4971 2018-05-28 14:15:00 The news that #OPEC and #Russia are going to skip the production agreement next month means that the price of oil will remain the same.
4972 2018-05-28 14:14:48 The only currency any country buys oil with has to use the dollar. That is why the dollar is a safe haven. If countries could use their own money. They would flood the market with dollars and the dollar index would fall
4973 2018-05-28 14:14:44 I see no reason for us to pay for oil and gas innovations. Better to use the cash to pay for gov debt. This debt is unsustainable. It is a bad habit that Ontario has shown us will end badly. Best to cut public sector employment now and dec deficit. @jkenney Doubt C tax will end.

4981 2018-05-28 14:14:15 Many of the companies are based in Canada too. Many foreign companies have thrown in the towel during low oil price times. Your false rhetoric is harmful on so many levels due to its blind assumptions and ignorance of the facts.
4982 2018-05-28 14:14:14 Breast and ribs has more skin, and more meat though. The juicy part is just oil.
4983 2018-05-28 14:14:12 Libya may be first, but only due to oil ports reopening this year after being closed for nearly 3 years and as of today 1 million barrels sold a day plus rising oil prices from July 2017 factor in to this growth.
4984 2018-05-28 14:14:11 Trivial oil spills should be trivialized. Why set your hair on fire for a tiny spill that was contained on site? I save my outrage for spills that are not trivial and actually damage the environment. The boy who cried wolf parable seems to apply here.

4996 2018-05-28 14:13:18 The rupee has slipped this month while rising crude oil prices are a factor. It would be fair to assume we may not have gained too much of an edge in the export market & the value of the currency plays less of a role in the growth of exports #lka

5007 2018-05-28 14:11:44 Smart Contract acting as an escrow. Oracle to trigger the contract when oil is delivered/received. Multi-Sig wallets for both parties so multiple individuals are signing off on the funds. The smart contract would need to be audited by a 3rd party, and match the paper contract.

5023 2018-05-28 14:09:55 I'm not trying to stick up for big oil but just look at the Infastructure/employment/delivery systems & retail outlets to deliver a litre of gas. These guys have to have volume to make money. The intent of the carbon tax is to decrease volume - vis-a-vis increase cost before tax.

5030 2018-05-28 14:09:19 But it's strange they won't allow a dieing child to take cannabis oil to live , what was on the news .  mental hospital staff have a drug to give to people who smoke weed or crack cocaine. They don't allow you to smoke weed . So we have a clash in Brent.

5065 2018-05-28 14:06:10 The rest of the planet is getting away from oil. Spend some time in China and Europe and you will see what they are doing to disengage from Russia and OPEC and become independent. Russia screwed China on an oil deal and China is powering forward.
5066 2018-05-28 14:06:08 You should start with "But But" Richy,,,scotland IS a rich country 
we have propped up the failing westminster long enough
They have bankrupted an oil rich country
you happy to ignore that though

Minerals: keep them in the ground,

5071 2018-05-28 14:05:50 @SteveScalise How about you increasing price of CRUDE OIL PRICE?  Trump received $1B in consideration of withdrawing from Iran Nuclear Agreement.  We had to help a country Saudi Arabia that attacked WORLD TRADE CENTER who controlled Dollar value. Great bonus.
5072 2018-05-28 14:05:37 Iraq just exported 100 million barrels of oil in April, maybe some of that money should go to the people.
5073 2018-05-28 14:05:36 Im so dumb, I drained the transmission fluid instead of the oil on one of the cars at work  glad I caught it 
5074 2018-05-28 14:05:33 Baking soda is useful and cheap : teeth - face - body - armpit 
Mix it with charcoal and mint essential  oil : whiten teeth 
With water : a great exfoliator for your face 
FOR YOUR ARMPIT IT WORKS A LOT (with lemon) : it whiten them
5075 2018-05-28 14:05:33 I have taken bigger pisses at pipeline stations...100L of oil would take about 15 minutes to clean up...

5084 2018-05-28 14:03:41 Excellent decision by @narendramodi led gov to allow trading in petrol&diesel futures;This will curb price volatility&also allow Oil importers locally,to hedge their risks&given that we import 80% of our crude requirements,this will also aid in curbing #Oil linked INR volatility!

5087 2018-05-28 14:03:24 If the EPA has an oil spill, which they did under Obama, yes it happened, but under Trump, if you are literally pouring oil and toxins into the rivers and oceans through EPA policies, you can say that it also happened under both admins. It’s not the same.
5088 2018-05-28 14:03:21 USA is busy carrying out the #PNAC plan since the late 90's bringing chaos and bloodshet to the Middle East for resource control (currently oil in the Golan) and to assist their Zionist masters with their Clean Break plans. @realDonaldTrump the hell with your peacekeeping force.
5089 2018-05-28 14:03:17 Right...cause after gas and the fact he'll literally have to get a oil change after he drives a few thousand miles. He'll spend a few hundred.

5092 2018-05-28 14:03:00 Sure it does. Less supply inside US leads to higher prices here. Oil companies selling US oil get paid more overseas??
5093 2018-05-28 14:02:57 FE theory, when examined critically and using the scientific method, is about a half step removed from snake oil sales of decades past. It relies on easily manipulated individuals who have some need to think they are smarter than everyone else.
5094 2018-05-28 14:02:50 Many things depends upon petroleum products. Bus fare also affected. But very cheap statement from honourable ministers that all r depends upon crude oil prices. Then what's d role of govt or ministers?

5096 2018-05-28 14:02:45 If you’re looking for a safe and natural way to dry out that oil and clean out microbial... put a dab of tea tree oil on it. It works crazy fast.
5097 2018-05-28 14:02:43 There was an article in PC Gamer a few years ago I believe about a guy who took on a second job so he could buy the 30K pack. I know someone that has it, they don't work, their family owns an oil company, so they just bought it with their adult allowance.
5098 2018-05-28 14:02:38 Ever had Greek dolmades? They're grape leaves stuffed with stuff and coated in olive oil. They're not pickled, and there's no actual grapes, but man are they good. And yeah, the POTUS is a self-obsessed idiot, no doubt.
5099 2018-05-28 14:02:32 And Israel should be allowed to invade, occupy and settle anywhere it likes in the ME, particularly is it can steal some oil in the process, is that the idea?

5103 2018-05-28 14:02:08 not all ... but it is a major reason for the unusually high increase ... our nation needs to invest in clean green energy to free ourselves from oil sheiks
5104 2018-05-28 14:02:01 The news is good. My eye is almost completely free of hemmoragic fluid now, no new vessel growth. The Avastin is working.
Will need shots every 13 weeks, and my vision will always be fuzzy with the oil, but (touch wood) my sight should stay stable for the foreseeable future.

will you say it fair game?
5127 2018-05-28 13:59:19 How about Trump receiving $1B from Saudi Arabia in consideration of withdrawing from Iran nuclear agreement effectively transferring control of Crude Oil Price to Saudi Arabia.  We need to help them for attacking WORLD TRADE CENTER, for control of Dollar value. Great Tax Cut.
5128 2018-05-28 13:59:18 A great example though of how the pro oil people look at and trivialize oil spills. How big does it have to be and how much has to spill into that river this happened next to for any of you to care? No wonder @Mike_A_Bernier is sitting on the opposition side! #bcpoli #vanpoli

There's almost no hemmoragic fluid left in the eye, the Avastin is working perfectly. I'll need the injections every 12 weeks for the rest of my life, and my vision will always be fuzzy with the oil in, but I've bought myself a lot of time.

5156 2018-05-28 13:56:34 Yeah clearly the latter part is the biggest challenge - also decoupling it from any political issues - a blanket citizen guaranteed oil dividend. 

I’d like to see it work with a ‘privatised’ NOC - with citizens owning shares and it paying dividend directly.

5160 2018-05-28 13:56:22 As well, according to GasBuddy: BC gets most of its supply from the US. “And that is costing us an additional 13-14 cents a litre, so all of this is death by a 1,000 cuts." Best part; it's our oil the US refines (sold at a discount) to make gas to sell back to us.Taxed of course
5161 2018-05-28 13:56:20 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please address the OPEC situation that has adversely affected the price  of oil per barrel. I am confident you have a strategy and the sooner it is employed the better for this of us that depend on this industry. Thank you for all you have done.
5162 2018-05-28 13:56:18 And that’s a crass argument. You don’t simply clean up oil. And the point is, spills will happen. Is this small in the grand scheme, yes. But what happens when it’s not. What happens if this crosses fresh water? What happens when you can simply “contain” and “clean” it up?
5163 2018-05-28 13:56:00 @narendramodi 
Does he know wat price common people r paying for it? Wat has he done about fuel prices in last four years? He had taken A dig at UPA for fuel prices wen crude oil was at 114 per barrel. N wen it come down to 70 per barrel why fuel prices didnt slash? double std ?
5164 2018-05-28 13:55:58 He's provoking world instability, which usually drives up oil prices, & conspiring with Russians & Saudis who benefit hugely. And corporate tax cuts benefit oil companies, not their workers. #Cult45 voters need to wake up—or is white supremacy more important?

5191 2018-05-28 13:52:13 Imagine if Saudis started trading $oil in $btc ? More legit than $usd
5192 2018-05-28 13:51:58 Nope.

We are still logging primeval broadleaf forest for the valuable hardwoods and then turn the land to agriculture.

Palm oil & Rubber Tree plantations are now creeping into central Africa now, backed by the big corporations from S.East Asia.
5193 2018-05-28 13:51:53 People say's that Bitcoin is bad because mining consumes a lot of energy, but what about oil ? Why are cars still running on oil when everyone knows that it pollutes the atmosphere and causes climate warming . Why We not start produce only electric or hydrogen cars ?
5194 2018-05-28 13:51:52 Yes, even oil when adjusted for inflation is cheaper than in the last 7 years. Higher prices does not equate to more expensive

5196 2018-05-28 13:51:50 Not sure why my wife's giving me the silent treatment
All I did was suggest she starts a Class Action against Oil of Olay for their Regenerist "ANTI-AGING" products.

5203 2018-05-28 13:51:03 Interestingly the list doesn't include pakistan bangladesh and srilanka..Petrol prices in these neighbouring countries are much cheaper than in india.
Surprisingly nepal which imports oil from india (that too refined) sell petrol at ₹68.

5207 2018-05-28 13:50:41 I wholeheartedly believe that every oil cent needs to be used for our advancement. Although we need to move away from the entitlement culture. It has deeply eroded our sense of initiative and capacity to compromise. UBI, i'm afraid, will disincentivise an already lagging society.
5208 2018-05-28 13:50:31 The short-handed AFC North really had it down pat: A word, a blank, an awkward oil rig, and a union logo.

5211 2018-05-28 13:50:10 I think they didn’t bring extra vessels of oil because they believed their lamps held enough—otherwise, wouldn’t they have brought more? I think their insufficient supply suggests their conviction that the Bridegroom is coming earlier than He actually is.

Uncover and cook, stirring occasionally, 10-15 minutes more, until very soft.

5238 2018-05-28 13:47:23 Thank you for calling out the logical fallacy / false dichotomy argument of shutting down oil production versus not expanding it.
5239 2018-05-28 13:47:14 It is important to remember that since 1989 there has not been an oil tanker disaster of similar magnitude. The shipping industry takes their environmental stewardship very seriously.

5248 2018-05-28 13:46:38 Gas prices always go up heading into Memorial Day. Get rid of the requirements of changing to summer blends and put more American oil in the markets when OPEC slows production as they have now. These two things will lower prices significantly.

5253 2018-05-28 13:45:59 DHL can't help my problem. I need to eat it almost straight from the hot oil, while the outside is still crunchy and the inside is still steaming.

The only pit stop allowed is on paper to drain excess oil, then dust it with cinnamon sugar.

5343 2018-05-28 13:34:24 May need the oil changed, then again I left a Fargo in the bush for 14 years, poured some gas down the carb swapped in a battery and drove it into the shop. 14 year old gas in the tank smelled a bit off, and I had to add a fuel filter.
5344 2018-05-28 13:34:21 Oil 101 is brilliant!
5345 2018-05-28 13:34:06 Not to mention their idea of tying their economy to oil. I’m sure that has no effect on any other country cough US cough.
5346 2018-05-28 13:34:05 The problem is the Liberals will then control the flow of oil out of Canada. Which means they can delay it, just stop the flow of oil out, or charge unrealistic prices to make it uneconomic. Canada’s oil industry will be doomed if it happens.
5347 2018-05-28 13:33:43 Russia and OPEC is planning to restart production of crude oil to pre 2017 levels or even more. This will significantly reduce the crude oil prices.

5460 2018-05-28 13:20:44 Rupee ended stronger against the US Dollar today, as Dollar sales by exporters supported the Rupee. However, oil importers' Dollar buys coupled with sharp rise in Dollar index and Dollar demand likely for defence-related payments limited gains for the Rupee.

5464 2018-05-28 13:20:21 Govt bond prices ended higher today as sharp fall in crude oil prices coupled with improved market sentiment. However, some caution ahead of RBI's monetary policy statement June 6 prompted some traders to book profits.

5466 2018-05-28 13:20:10 much of these things need competence. I worked on this particular issue as a brief for an oil & gas firm. I cried on what my research was showing. without institutional memory, research most of MPs don't know what they are passing & what they mean today and 50 yrs ahead
5467 2018-05-28 13:20:02 I myself leans toward experienced coconut oil, coconut oil that has been there and knows what to do
5468 2018-05-28 13:19:50 For the first time in years, non oil revenue surpassed oil revenue. For the first time, the poor is directly benefitting from the govt through social intervention programs. And you want us to trade all these for what?
5469 2018-05-28 13:19:48 Indian equities ended higher today. Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 gained for a third straight day following a decline in oil prices and easing geopolitical tensions.
5470 2018-05-28 13:19:43 I don't know if you meant, "sweetest" or "sweatiest" also, pretty sure "default" is one word, but hey, you're exactly what a lying, no platform, pandering to the rich, snake oil salesman like Doug loves the most, a low info voter.

5475 2018-05-28 13:19:03 Mr. Trump, I see a post about your concerns with people out to get you.  It is true, I have the greatest admiration for you, as the money and power make you a target for jealousy and terror.  It is you own people who will try to boil you ion oil.  The GOV. is the terrorists.
5476 2018-05-28 13:18:55 Mate, one thing you have to understand is, UK, France and America have screwed up these countries with endless wars in the name of fighting terrorism. Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria etc destroyed.  Why? because of oil. It's not right.

5482 2018-05-28 13:17:36 When the cannabis oil was so obviously working it is just madness to withold it.
5483 2018-05-28 13:17:31 when oil comes under GST ,fuel prices will be charged maximum slab of 28% only.Then we can fill 1 L petrol for less than 60rs
5484 2018-05-28 13:17:25 Gas up frm $220 to 310 in my area. For me its extra 150 per month. It’s a tax HIKE to Americans to make VLAD happy. 

It’s always abt OIL $$
5485 2018-05-28 13:16:56 Opposite happened to me years ago. Came home from the pub and thought I was taking a swig of Cod liver oil before I went to bed. Turned out it was vegetable oil, doh!
5486 2018-05-28 13:16:51 Anyone used CBD oil for anxiety/depression etc?
5487 2018-05-28 13:16:42 We were importing twice as much oil under Obama as Trump.

5490 2018-05-28 13:16:29 Asian markets ended mixed amid an extended slide in oil prices. European  stocks were trading mildly higher despite political uncertainty in  Italy.
5491 2018-05-28 13:16:26 There is actually very little proof to show that Hash Oil prevents seizures. But there is evidence that people will say/do whatever they want to get THC in their system and act stupid.
5492 2018-05-28 13:16:21 Oil prices continue to correct sharply, with Brent futures falling 1.4  percent to $75.35 a barrel as Saudi Arabia and Russia may increase  supplies. Rising US production also showed no signs of abating.
5493 2018-05-28 13:16:18 @ShereenBhan USD/INR to trade in a broad range of 65-67 within 1 yr time scenario notwithstanding changes in Crude Oil Prices.
Currently our calculation is the Rupee strengthens by $1 when NYMEX Oil falls by $5.
5494 2018-05-28 13:16:18 So many. One of my favorites. Split, roast with salt cumin & olive oil. Drizzle with tahini, yogurt & pomegranate molasses
5495 2018-05-28 13:16:18 Hardly a blip on the media radar Mr.President. They forgot what a "good" economy looks like. How about the surplus of jobs?  Bound to raise wages if you believe in capitalism. How about opening the artic oil reserves & regime change in Venezuela? Would reduce our enemies power

5498 2018-05-28 13:15:44 If you study into it, I know you will see all the great medical benefits of the oil as medicine. See smoking the plant does not get one the quality medicine they may need. Rick Simpson used it on his cancers and made it for others to help with theirs as well. Worth a study.
5499 2018-05-28 13:15:43 SpiceJet is locked at 20 percent upper circuit following correction in  oil prices and after brokerage house, Stewart & Mackertich Research  initiated coverage on the airline with a strong buy rating.

5501 2018-05-28 13:15:38 Can we say the same for our country? Our foreign reserve was going down at a time oil price was going up. Maybe @MBuhari could have done better. Maybe he made mistakes. The most important thing is we are back on track, with a more diversified economy.

5503 2018-05-28 13:15:30 @EnvAgency - sea water in Christchurch Bay near Highcliffe has a large area of scum and a noxious smells of cooking oil. Lots of young children swimming and paddling. The smell is widespread even to the top of the cliffs. Is it safe, has anyone checked it?

5512 2018-05-28 13:14:52 Fracking is a lie and we suffer for it. Fracking wells peak far sooner than conventional oil, they are a loss to investors and they pollute groundwater, affecting the health of millions.

5526 2018-05-28 13:13:20 Sorry. I got this too late to be of help for last night's dinner.  But I would say, olive oil is healthier but butter is super tasty.  Also butter burns easier so you could go half and half for a perfect flavor and function combo:)

5570 2018-05-28 13:08:42 Just remembered; that’s what happens when you have had lots of chemo; about the gas prices. They are fixed and spike around holidays and summer. The oil companies jack them up because they can. There’s no shortage, federal government doesn’t control that.
5571 2018-05-28 13:08:39 Too early to celebrate. Legal brains will burn Midnight's oil to knock the courts. Remember people like P.Chidambaram who helped Sterlite in the past. Shameless govt. will cite court order and allow them to open.

5718 2018-05-28 12:50:45 @giofer79 Mr Ferrero, my whole family loves Nutella but since you started including palm oil we have stopped eating it. Is there a chance that you could go back to the original recipe? If so you will be also bemaking a valuable contribution to the conservation of the orangatan.

5810 2018-05-28 12:39:45 That the biggest purchasers of oil from Iran - China and India - will continue to buy (India says it only respects U.N. sanctions, not go-it-alone American actions) may, by itself, demolish Trump's Iran strategy.

5852 2018-05-28 12:33:32 @narendramodi I am sorry to say but you have to do something about fuel ....73 and 80 rupees diesel and petrol respectively which is highly deniable .....sir you have to build GST on crude oil...that is why we all students try to transfer in another country.
5853 2018-05-28 12:33:22 "i love oil!"

5855 2018-05-28 12:33:05 Vienna- Iran demands that European Union guarantee buying Iranian oil as condition for Tehran staying with "nuke deal". 
But that's just posturing. 
Only 7 of 28 EU members buy Iranian crude, about 19 per cent of total Iranian oil exports. The 7 could easily find other suppliers.
5856 2018-05-28 12:33:00 Trust me it's the same story in every country.. 
I have no clue what these ppl have done. They easily get minority status and special status and the poor guy who reports these gets jailed. 
May be the Oil power is too big and controls the govt?
5857 2018-05-28 12:32:53 If our oil prices are market driven & free from Govt control then how come they were not increasing during #KarnatakaElection2018 but suddently started increasing on daily basis after that ? @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley @Devinder_Sharma @ajit_ranade @mayurshetty01 @narendramodi
5858 2018-05-28 12:32:53 The solution is that the West and Europe should  find a cure for oil addiction before  2050
5859 2018-05-28 12:32:37 It’s the EU which want a border. Not us. It’s there problem let them deal with it. The EU has already a border of sorts. They check for fuel oil or something. It was in the news last week. 
5860 2018-05-28 12:32:37 In Nov Dems will pretend to go #MAGA but will drink the @TeamPelosi kool-aid once in Congress...voters should not be fooled by @TheDemocrats snake oil sales--America loses every time a Dem steps to a mic @OutnumberedFNC @JulieBanderas @KatiePavlich @KatTimpf @TheFive @thehill

5866 2018-05-28 12:31:45 On a side note. Didn’t realise how many African countries use the yellow containers for cooking oil. I hadn’t noticed these when living Malawi.

5872 2018-05-28 12:30:58 The 1400 year old religious civil war between the Sunni and the Shi'a is the main cause of tragedy in the Middle East. The Saudis only talk to us because we pay a fortune for their oil. Otherwise the West is incidental to their motivations. We don't make them stone women dead.

5874 2018-05-28 12:30:50 Oh yes ,but they don’t prove age in themselves. It has been proven that rock layers can be laid down rapidly. Where do you think all the oil and coal came from. Vegetation and animals that were covered rapidly in the massive flood.

5879 2018-05-28 12:30:25 Really, why should they avoid buying Iranian oil? They aren’t developing A-Bombs. Their reward was that we would buy their oil. (It lowered the price. Is that why Trump left the deal? A deal with the Saudis and Russia?)
5880 2018-05-28 12:30:24 We must continue to Fight against Coal and Oil,  Clean Renewable Energy Sources. Creating long term permanent jobs IN all States building and maintaining Solar Panels and Wind Turbines. Oil Tycoons made money and almost killed the Planet.  Palm Oil needs to go also, Rainforest !

5886 2018-05-28 12:29:34 I know. Please be assured this little band if fucking tools are not the majority view. I’m tempted to start my own petition to get these fools boiled alive in oil or something 
5887 2018-05-28 12:29:27 TOKYO- Union of Japanese Oil Trade says it will decide whether or not to continue importing oil from Iran, taking risk of running into new sanctions imposed by US. 
Japan is fifth largest importer of crude from Iran and one of the few that have fully paid Iran for past imports.

5889 2018-05-28 12:29:18 Trashing the Iran deal was the gift to US Oil that will keep on giving. We'll be back to $5 a gallon sooner than later. If only this was the dumbest thing Trump will ever do. On this Memorial Day, are you really willing to sacrifice your children in a Trump War to save his ass?

5899 2018-05-28 12:28:23 @cspanwj  After GWB financial disaster, the oil companies need to recoup losses. I'm surprised it has not happened sooner.
5900 2018-05-28 12:28:10 So you’re view is that having some but less oil income (as opposed to no oil income) is optimal?
5901 2018-05-28 12:28:06 @algore We need your support in Portugal. Our Government wants to make a perforation to start exploring oil on the wonderful coast of Algarve. That will have a huge negative effect on environment and in society. Thank you!

5912 2018-05-28 12:26:42 Nothing excites me like the 90.39% contribution from the non-oil sectors to the GDP. 

with the world on course to shifting away from oil, this is indeed good for the future of Nigeria.

5917 2018-05-28 12:25:55 @VORdotcom, you authoritatively command people as if they are dirt and tell them not to follow you if they have a weak stomach. Why? Do you feed digital castor oil through your unscrupulous tweets against the Hindus while putting up that wicked boy adamant face?

5922 2018-05-28 12:25:19 The unspoken reason to pull out of the Iran deal was to raise the cost of oil. Another way to rip off the consumers, with the blessing of Congress.
5923 2018-05-28 12:25:02 Surplus oil revenues should not be used for political gains.

5981 2018-05-28 12:17:08 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @StateDept 1) IMO #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf meeting a few days ago where they agree to cut supplies & push price of Oil barrel to $100 , after all US+EU+Western World has done for them , is insulting. Congress silence about S.Arabia/Gulf Oil manipulations is evil
5982 2018-05-28 12:17:04 Coconut oil is almost a miracle product in some circles. Granted those circles are mostly food related but I would not be surprised if it broke into other health categories as well. While it is wonderful to cook with I doubt I would smear it on my body as a sunscreen.

When the price was fuel was decided to be linked to marker price, ppl expected it to drop when market price of crude oil dropped. Govt needs to communicate in better way on this,

5994 2018-05-28 12:15:20 Actually the EU would fastrack scots in,,cos they want access to Europes largest oil and gas fields.
They would get scots in just to piss off England who have been a thorn in the EU`s side for 40 years.
The UK had a better deal than others but still not happy

6011 2018-05-28 12:13:26 technically the gas prices fluctuate determining WHEN you buy the oil. I guess if you invested when the oil prices are as low as it can go you can buy lots of it for a cheaper price and have it last... maybe a program, but then again how long is fossil fuel really gonna last for?

6018 2018-05-28 12:12:49 Will Venezuela produce more oil with higher crude prices?
6019 2018-05-28 12:12:48 It's the Russians and OPEC dwindling the world supply that is raising prices.  Oil production in US at record levels, yet the oily oligarchs are screwing us again!
6020 2018-05-28 12:12:44 That said, just witnessed a guy lifting a bucket of vegetable oil out of a van, only to immediately drop it and have the contents engulf his feet.

So it could be worse.

6028 2018-05-28 12:11:34 Do you think borrowings from international debt markets are some halwa without any attendant risks? Do you think international debt markets didnt know how precarious the oil companies financial position were due to the pre-2014 sales below cost?
6029 2018-05-28 12:11:33 Baby oil! Leave it on for half an hour and it should rinse the tan right off

6041 2018-05-28 12:10:10 Everything is not in maintaining foreign policy,what's the benefit of this policy when the cost of oil is going to north continuously
6042 2018-05-28 12:10:08 هو لابد من الأستعانة بشركات متخصّصة. لكن يبقى السؤال متى تصبح الشركة متخصّصة بمجال الطاقة في UpStream تبحث وتنقب وتنتج الغاز والنفط بالعالم بتكلفة منافسة وليس فقط ب DownStream Oil Industries. كذلك يجب أندماج قطاع البتروكيماويات بالشركة مع سابك للتركيز على الصناعة العالمية للطاقة.
6043 2018-05-28 12:09:49 The pipeline was never about safety, it was about speed to market and cost savings. Alberta has a shrinking window to maximize profits because the need for oil will continue to decrease and other markets offer much cheaper options. We know this.
6044 2018-05-28 12:09:48 How about some hemp biomass gas to help alleviate oil gas prices?

6049 2018-05-28 12:09:00 I did reply to you I just didn't want to waste my energy on your invalid argument . Plenty of illegal things are good for your health such as cannabis oil which gets rid of cancer. Alcohol and smoking cause more deaths per year than ecstasy & yet both are legal.

6051 2018-05-28 12:08:29 Well, I track US Oil and Gas companies...and in the last one year alone, have been involved (in a very small way), with debt raises of more than $10bn by companies which have much lower credit rating that ONGC!
6052 2018-05-28 12:08:27 Coal is plentiful  as well as oil and gas so let's expand its use .
6053 2018-05-28 12:08:08 Any tips on barbecuing steak (Nigel)? Just brush with a little olive oil, salt and pepper?
6054 2018-05-28 12:08:05 I'm willing to consider the oil industry innocent.  It's possible they are simply too optimistic on each spill, thinking it to have contained much less than it did.  It's only when one loses a defined volume that one won't be inaccurate, as when an 800,000 barrel tanker sinks.

6091 2018-05-28 12:03:16 That's because Geologists are useful to society & employed by Oil companies who want you to believe that it's only CO2 from coal is bad.
6092 2018-05-28 12:03:16 India's daily oil demand is abt 4mn bbls.we import about 80% - right strategy would hv been to acquire stakes in some large oilfields, let's say, for at least 0.5 mmbbls/d (net). Strategic reserves has a different purpose altogether - we probably added a few min bbls if capacity.

6253 2018-05-28 11:38:56 So @ElleJasminBlogs has been craving lavender to the extent that the word craving is a clear and definite understatement.

6536 2018-05-28 10:48:09 Huh? Of course they care, most warmongers benefit from war in one way or another. I’ve never seen an employee of an oil company advocate for clean energy. If Iran will be embroiled in war for the next decade, it only would mean more weapons sales.
6537 2018-05-28 10:48:01 What I implied up there relates to per capita income. The higher the income per head the better the govt can plan for education subsidies. Let's not pretend the oil wealth now per population is as high as during Awo's cocoa era.

Besides, it has oil prospects in Edward and gas is already up and running in Kivu.

6554 2018-05-28 10:44:42 Trump cut costs for big oil and opened up drilling for them even at the risk of our environment.

Trump gave big oil huge tax cuts on their profits even at the cost of raising our national debt for future wage earners. 

Big oil gives us the highest gas prices in four years.

6556 2018-05-28 10:44:18 From $28 to $75 for oil price in the last three years yet the government blame the past, cry for money and borrow like those on drugs.
6557 2018-05-28 10:44:13 The world’s biggest oil producers are Russia and Saudi Arabia. I don’t think the West should be funding either.

6568 2018-05-28 10:42:42 Could have fooled me.

Gas prices at the pump at a 4 year high despite cutting regulatory costs for big oil companies and giving them massive tax breaks on their profits.
6569 2018-05-28 10:42:41 Essentially all proved not a one of them worthy of Premier. Not one laid a single believable plan forward for Ont.

6583 2018-05-28 10:40:31 Yeah I always said rubbing coconut oil on the skin then going out in the sun especially if it's salt water is no better than seasoning the skin before being baked.

Regressive!

Petron will implement the following price increases (VAT incl) effective tomorrow 6 am, May 29: P0.65/li for gasoline, P0.35/li for diesel, and P0.45/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market. Thank you.
6817 2018-05-28 09:52:32 Try telling some Ts that VAK is nonesense or that other ‘new’ ideas (iHattie, open classrooms, coding etc) arent worthy of complete upheaval over. Ts are the ultimate suckers for Edu-snake oil. So I think the backlash is often around evidence, fads and herd mentality 
6818 2018-05-28 09:52:20 Media should also explain that India is in debt paying to oil companies in Iran .why did not Congress govt made payment to Iran ,to resolve of payment left of 700 million oil debt

6898 2018-05-28 09:37:23 So is the idea: nuclear generates unused heat which we don't use. If we did use oil/gas to generate that amount, it would create such-and-such emissions. "So", let's include those amounts in nuclear's emission amount.
Probably not, for that would not make any sense.

Helped crony capitalism
7079 2018-05-28 08:58:14 It might cost more, but what is the cost of keeping soldiers in the Middle East to keep the sea lanes open for safe travel of oil tankers?  Besides, if the recycling is done domestically, it provides jobs to the local area. Keep$ money at home instead of sending it oversea$.
7080 2018-05-28 08:57:30 I'm an Akaskan. Mr. Trump wants to open the Alaska Wildlife Reserve to oil drilling. The Reserve's fragile and a migration destination of the largest herds of herbivores outside of Africa. There's also an Alaskan Independence Party. Don't mess with our environment. We'll secede.

I think they think that if they keep spinning that crap, people will buy it. Not this time Fiona- You’ve run out of excuses! Fiona would do well selling snake oil.

7093 2018-05-28 08:56:15 What was the crude oil px than and now ..
7094 2018-05-28 08:56:01 If 70s oil blockage proved anything, it was Rich != Powerful. Whilst Elon has funds to turn his dreams into reality, think he's starting to wear a tin foil hat a bit too often.
7095 2018-05-28 08:56:00 But I am worried for my nation oil price benchmark was increased by $6. Another year of appalling budget performance in view.
7096 2018-05-28 08:55:44 I got your point yes, translating it to italian it makes sense. I don't see how can you believe that the balance is "meretricious". At this point we've entered in a realm of conspiracy theories that some people rig their research because they are funded by oil companies
7097 2018-05-28 08:55:39 First prize last night goes to @freddysheed who accidentally put scented lamp oil in everyone’s drinks
7098 2018-05-28 08:55:39 No, panels are made of glass, plastic, stainless steel and micro chips.  Many of those items may have to be imported, but they are not 'flash points' like oil.  Panels last 30 years.   Gallon of oil lasts about an hour of driving time.  Not  anti nuke, just pro freedom from oil.
7099 2018-05-28 08:55:38 Not online but it's easy! Steam leeks in 3cm chunks and dress w oil and lemon. 

Mix a small tub greek yoghurt w crushed garlic (1 or 2 cloves), 2 tbsps oil, plenty of chopped dill, tsp dijon mustard, seasoning. Pour over leeks, garnish with sumac if possible (sqz lemon if not).
7100 2018-05-28 08:55:30 People can sell crude oil futures for May delivery, our target is below 4350 in this week .
7101 2018-05-28 08:55:30 Also  Please note there is no service lane there to reach Indian oil petrol pump as road service ended before petrol pump .Please take up this issue with @noida_authority as it will solve permanent problem  . Thanks .
7102 2018-05-28 08:55:08 Agreed. We’re experiencing something similar in US today as nuclear plants are being forced to close to make way for growing natural gas supplies & cheap, low labor gas turbine power plants.
Big Oil & construction contractors were strong allies of “motor industries”
7103 2018-05-28 08:55:04 Tomorrow will mainly be someone beating me up and contorting my body, rubbing oil and salt on me, then wrapping me in mud, then giving me a bath.

7475 2018-05-28 07:36:15 Gas prices are twice what they should be, all of the volitivity is purely price gouging. Three miles down the road in my city prices go from $2.90 to $2.62. Every time there is a mention of oil prices rising gas goes up 30 to 40 cents a clip. Been going on for years not Trump

7495 2018-05-28 07:33:00 Mam, we expect you to touch upon the issue of petrol rise and a sound policy statement on domestic prices vis-a-vis international crude oil prices. Probably, a comparison with other Asian countries could also b don. It'll settle lot of dust around, and unauthentic data gng arnd.
7496 2018-05-28 07:32:55 The economic case is still tied to oil. It was doable at oil price in 2014 and will mean significant cuts now  even with oil as it stands today. I don't quite buy into idea that Brussels will be nicer to us than Westminster.
7497 2018-05-28 07:32:50 Coconut oil is too thick for my skin, I favour extra virgin olive oil
7498 2018-05-28 07:32:45 The guy my roommate had over came out in his underwear asked me if I had lube. I lied and said no and 5 minutes later he came out and asked me if I had olive oil. I truly hope that wasn’t the substitute. But what else could it be used for???
7499 2018-05-28 07:32:39 Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya. Funny how we always end up trying to “help”. If Mexico had a bunch of oil, we would be all up in that country trying to “help”

7508 2018-05-28 07:30:58 When crude oil price was nearing 130-140$ barrel, petrol was priced at between 65-70rs per litre (past). Today petrol is at 70-80$ per barrel but we are paying 80-83rs per litre, (a barrel of crude oil is 159 litre appox). Worth thinking.

7515 2018-05-28 07:29:20 Until I see anything to change my opinion on FSG then it still stands which is FSG are attempting to compete in a world they don't belong in.

7558 2018-05-28 07:21:53 If you chart Oil vs USD/EM fx, recently higher oil = higher USD/EM which goes against the old correlation, higher oil = lower USD/EM. Oil was probably too high and we are now seeing a normalisation.

7601 2018-05-28 07:15:12 I agree that it is not what most people eat now. Today most people eat processed crap most of the time. Bolleria, fries (fried in sunflower oil). I am constantly surprised when I see what people are buying at the supermarket... not a lot to do w. traditional diet.

7621 2018-05-28 07:11:51 When you're taxed in extortionate proportions on oil prices it diminishes purchasing power of citizens and as a result consumer demand is affected which in turn affects the economy in terms of GDP

7637 2018-05-28 07:08:33 At this point, it’s a given that Russians interfered in the elections to get him elected. The motivation for Russians was higher oil prices by reimposing sanctions on Iran. Both objectives have been achieved btw. 3.55$/gal at the pump today in Seattle area.

Cody will still be my main pick once he drops but I think I’m gonna go back and try out Rashid again for a little bit to see how I feel.
7651 2018-05-28 07:05:48 lol, no. he was at “war” with ice just like he was at “war” with big oil and defense. for Gods sake use you’re brain and eyes and not just a corporate media echo for a mouth.

7724 2018-05-28 06:52:31 Why not ask the same five on ur channel whya ware house or refinery did not stock up on oil whe n it was cheap ?
7725 2018-05-28 06:52:23 Does the Federal Oceans Protection Plan specifically cover oil spills on the West Coast that occurred prior to its introduction?
7726 2018-05-28 06:52:16 It's gonna be a 72 hours strike of Brazilian oil company's Union
7727 2018-05-28 06:52:08 On a short notice, they can restart the Neutral Zone, yet this is heavy oil, which does not help very much.
7728 2018-05-28 06:52:00 @narendramodi @arunjaitley sir,you have taken away the food from our plate,thru gst,high oil prices,demonetisation, what is the point
7729 2018-05-28 06:51:54 @narendramodi sir have an idea to lower oil price.just think about it once.agreed that u can’t decrease prices for d sake of your welfare schemes but how about removing securities and vip treatment to politicians and their relatives?They are capable enough to protect themselves..
7730 2018-05-28 06:51:50 Funny how foreign policies have so much effect on our brands here. I wonder if our policies also have same effect
7731 2018-05-28 06:51:39 เป็นแบบนี้กี่รอบแล้ว
7732 2018-05-28 06:51:34 Crude Oil falls, once again Arun Jaitley gets lucky.
7733 2018-05-28 06:51:34 Don't deny that
7734 2018-05-28 06:51:20 #OilPrices retreat from their #4YEARHIGH as #Russian & #Saudi Energy ministers have signalled the coailation led by #OPEC, which will gradually rise Oil production by second half of the year. Will this lessen the anxiety of consumers??
7735 2018-05-28 06:51:11 Is it time to get #greenpeace  activists ready? I think so.
What little oil under Florida is not worth the damage to get it. Similar to mountain top removal for coal.

7739 2018-05-28 06:50:38 Why india. Is furious about petrol price rise 
In nepal in our currency its 110 rs we didnot complain coz we know it will over come contry loan 
And i came to know india has huge iran oil loan ,i guess they should support their government  @narendramodi #FuelLootBySuitBoot
7740 2018-05-28 06:50:31 Coconut oil? Char.
7741 2018-05-28 06:50:22 Even with more than $73 per barrel of crude oil? Your government would soon be exposed.

7745 2018-05-28 06:49:41 kleveru itu sama hampir2 sama kaya merk haple & purivera. essence oil gitu deh, kebanyakan dari essence ricebrain, grapeseed, almond, rose water dll. itu buat ngobatin jerawat, whitening, terus ngeratain tekstur wajah kalo ga salah .. lupa deh apa aja fungsinya wkwkwk
7746 2018-05-28 06:49:37 I have tried gargling water, salt water, stuck my head over steaming hot water with olbas oil, taking pills, everything. And I just can not clear my nose or throat enough to the point I can sleep. Honestly I'm going to die of sleep deprivation probably.
7747 2018-05-28 06:49:36 Thanks for pointing this out. I will go back and reread the tweet. But my view is still that women who put down another group should remember our fight for our rights. We were once where minorities are now.

7751 2018-05-28 06:49:03 Musk is driving New Energy that will replace fossil fuels.  We fight wars for the fossil fuel industry.  We slap sanctions on Iran for the fossil fuel industry... higher gas prices.  Oil owns the News.    People .. if you are genuine think this through.

7755 2018-05-28 06:48:00 I’m at Starbucks and a woman by me just put on some sort of coconut body oil. I hate coconuts. She’s also taking up three seats with her a purse and work junk. I think she might be a demon from hell.

7762 2018-05-28 06:46:51 Agree with the hedge funds as shale cannot deliver on gasoline. The restart of the Neutral zone will not help either as this is heavy oil. The world is definitely running out of gasoline.
7763 2018-05-28 06:46:39 Many of the comments attacking Elon are designed to support fossil fuels.  How many comments are by bots.  Oil industry in comment sections constantly attacking New energy.  If Natasha says this on TV she may never appear on the “News” programs again.

7765 2018-05-28 06:45:52 There are recipes that prevent that, eg with added oil. You also don't have tk store it air tight if you store it with a damp cloth on it.

7785 2018-05-28 06:42:38 The oil industry fossil fuel advertisers.   It is most obvious on CNBC.  But no media attacks oil or tells inspiring stories of clean energy.  Regarding foreign policy politics all stories support oil industry interests.  Natasha. We love you but.
7786 2018-05-28 06:42:34 In the week to 22 May, money managers continued to unwind positions on crude oil futures for the fifth consecutive week, liquidating an estimated $2.9bn of long notional exposure on crude oil futures, while simultaneously increasing their short notional exposure by an $1.3bn.

7795 2018-05-28 06:41:27 In this case, is it the media or the oil companies in the way? They have a lot of money and power. I'm sure they don't want electric cars getting in the way of selling dino juice. Know your enemy.

7799 2018-05-28 06:41:10 Oil prices slumped on Monday, extending steep declines from Friday, as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they may increase supplies and as U.S. production gains show no signs of abating.

7991 2018-05-28 06:08:03 @narendramodi  don't give in on oil prices..
Subsidy or excise cut will not help anybody..
Next time build a Oil stabilization fund..
Everytime it's below $70 the difference in price goes directly into the fund per barrel imported..
Everytime it's above we use this fund..

8003 2018-05-28 06:06:09 Cool! I just wanna have a go at cleansing balm for curiosity sake. I usually double cleanse - oil and then foam/gel cleanser anyway...but don't know if the second step is more than necessary if I use balm cos it's supposed to be an all-in-one cleanser right?
8004 2018-05-28 06:06:03 Considering that Bret Stephens (in New York Times) literally PRAISED gasoline as being possibly better than solar/electric,
it's very plausible that Big Oil is funding journalists to attack Elon/Tesla.

This is such a gross, inaccurate take, it's actually just slander.

8134 2018-05-28 05:41:14 It was a bunch of troll accounts, many which had never tweeted before who were trying to portray his comment as antisemitic.  It seemed so coordinated I thought it was from big oil companies or even the Russian government (which I would never usually accuse).

8137 2018-05-28 05:40:53 Crude oil prices have gone down drastically since friday (400+ rupees a barrel) .  Why isn't there a reduction in petrol and diesel prices yet?
8138 2018-05-28 05:40:46 Is Petrol that costly at Rs.80? "Time value of money" means ~Rs. 55/liter(2013 terms). CPI barely 50% of then level, hence price more tolerable. Transmission in economy happens with a time-lag. Rs. 1 cut in duty=Rs. 14,000 cr loss in revenue. Oil Futures are showing lower levels.

8141 2018-05-28 05:40:35 And the whole idea is that in the near future, all those private trucks and cars will also be electric. Right? Like the Chinese, who are electrifying bus fleets the size of London’s every week. It’s already impacting the demand for global oil. Canada further and further behind.

8149 2018-05-28 05:39:13 Some US refiners have done it and some may continue but it has been a small amount considering how cheap US crude is. In Europe nobody is doing anything as far as I am aware. In Asia, there is talk some Chinese teapots may add some but state oil companies nothing mentioned
8150 2018-05-28 05:39:13 I think Kenya has oil & the DRC has coltan which apparently everyone needs in their cell phones. I feel like foreign aid kills local entrepreneurship ... I dunno. All of this hurts my soul.

8171 2018-05-28 05:34:43 Nope, because you wouldn’t let us fire Obama so the precedence has been set. If only the looney liberals would let us drill our own oil, that we have enormous amounts of, gas prices wouldn’t be an issue.
8172 2018-05-28 05:34:05 The crude oil price reduce in the international market from 80$ per barrel to 75$ per barrel. Inspite of that the patrol and diseal price rises on 15 day. #SaafNiyatSahiVikas #SabkaSathSabkaVikas

8178 2018-05-28 05:33:24 Quick lesson on oil prices. The top 3 producers are responsible for the price, based on their production. #2 Saudi Arabia and #3 Russia slowed production, causing the price increase. #1 America said nope and kept production the same. Had they slowed, prices would be even higher.
8179 2018-05-28 05:33:23 @RadioX good morning Pippa and Toby. No bank holiday over here in Germany. We have ours on Thursday so it’s a normal working day for me. Fixing an oil leak on a Challenger 604 engine.

8186 2018-05-28 05:31:24 you'd use less oil for the ICEs that are gone. overall, it would be net positive for the earth. that's an actual fact. (but gladly renewables grow)

8204 2018-05-28 05:28:09 I don't think the president is always to blame for the price of gas. Sure, decisions can affect the market but the U.S. doesn't have that much control over world price of oil

8211 2018-05-28 05:26:13 Every generation worries about this. People in the 1940s had a LOT more to worry about, the early 60s with the Cold War and Cuban Missile crisis. What about the 70s with the oil crisis? The early 80s with mass unemployment.

8237 2018-05-28 05:20:35 What’s the matter with Bernie? He has a blind spot where Palestinians are concerned; failing to see that European NGO’s pay tribute for oil to Arabs. This cash pays families of Jew killers and buys weapons
8238 2018-05-28 05:20:34 That’s to the fact the USA is exporting oil so they can control the price. Saudi ‘s have said they need oil at $80 per barrel. What is the price in the futures markets?

8255 2018-05-28 05:16:56 Prediction it will go down further as Saudi and Russia, pump in more oil into the market. Also US-IRAN sanction issue will further play a role. If US walks out of Iran deal, there are chances IRAN will dump oil in the market, to hurt US and others.
8256 2018-05-28 05:16:50 Heating oil for boilers especially water and heat systems should be considered too.

8273 2018-05-28 05:13:52 You are acting like the choice is oil or no oil....if we shut the taps off you will quickly come out of denial. I wish we did not need oil then I would agree. Pipelines are a lesser evil. But if stopped no prob we will ship by rail

8278 2018-05-28 05:13:18 Vegetable oils can replace olive oil in the typical Nigerian diet. 

Not palm oil - which has a greater saturated fat content. Also, need to remember that bleached palm oil is often sold as vegetable oil in the Naija.
8279 2018-05-28 05:12:55 This needs to be brought to everyone’s attention!!! And people need to listen! If nfl doesn’t then that means nfl and trump and oil r are in cahoots and we the people need to revolt!!
8280 2018-05-28 05:12:49 The assumption that all power must be generated by fossil fuels is complete BS, line spewed by oil company propagandists.

8286 2018-05-28 05:11:31 What crap is this. Define rich! What is the scale? You just talk about connections.l, which you can simply create. But what about affordability for everyone? At INR800, it's an expensive affair and ur looting is considering the price oil per barrel.
8287 2018-05-28 05:11:30 yeah lol my face hurt then i beat up the oil lol jk
8288 2018-05-28 05:11:20 Ok have a train go next to the rivers that feed  it. The oil is gonna come one way or another. Pick the safest way... We are all oil crack heads. No one lives oil free until we do pick the safest way.

8320 2018-05-28 05:06:37 The biggest gift to the #Iranian regime was neither oil nor gas. It was the global indulgence towards its terror activities. #Trump is different. Unlike his stance on N. Korea, he is so tough on #Iran. And this is what is needed.
8321 2018-05-28 05:06:32 This is literally a bathtub full of oil, no where near the ocean or any waterway.  And they’re monitoring air quality?  For what?  C’mon CBC.  You’re not the national enquirer.

8339 2018-05-28 05:02:56 How about it @GeorgeHeyman  ? I am sure you are on it already, but it sure is looking like, just by logic, that @KM_Canada is obviously lying to locals and B.C about how much oil they spilled today.

Would be nice to know. The amount they have admitted to just doesn't add up.
8340 2018-05-28 05:02:37 Everyone  quoting  crude price bt they aren't  telling that right now countries are charging  transport  charge as well  during 2012-2014 ..iran was under pressure  of America  only India was buying oil from them
8341 2018-05-28 05:02:12 what i understand the oil that u rub on your body dont get u high because they take that part out when making the oil.  the thc oil i have is smokeable but does get me stoned . Marijuana and other use isnt just 4 stoners anymore. the natural chemicals have serious health benifits
8342 2018-05-28 05:02:08 In day-to-day life you can't mix oil and water, while both are solvents. 
You won't feel choking if you stop pretending that all religions are same and benevolent.
8343 2018-05-28 05:02:01 Agreed - i do feel the intention is good. Just that there are other ways to do it. The irony wd be ppl contribute small amount to crowdfund but at the same time ask for BRIM, increase oil subsidy etc which are much more that whatever crowdfunded amount

8376 2018-05-28 04:56:03 If the media covered big oil fairly, they'd be getting the same coverage as ISIS.

The fact they're not indicates pretty big bias. They mostly don't get covered at all, certainly not relative to the damage they're doing.

8393 2018-05-28 04:53:44 They were right about peak conventional oil. The new sources of oil being exploited in the past decade are all gains from existing sources using much more energy intensive extraction techniques—and it’s poorer quality oil. Desperate measures. James Kunstler has remained relevant.

8399 2018-05-28 04:52:10 Widen.  What a lying son of a gun.  He is clearly intelligent but still lies to get some political advantage.

Oil and gas prices are impacted by many things.  What about the Widen/Obama limits on drilling for oil?

Do you think that less oil available would reduce prices
8400 2018-05-28 04:51:47 I think it’s chickpeas, olive oil, lemon, garlic, nutritional yeast, curry powder, and some other spices? It freezes really well so I make a big batch at once.
8401 2018-05-28 04:51:03 Oil futures hit six-week lows on expectations major producers may ease output curbs while Asian stocks and U.S. share futures gained on signs the United States and North Korea were still working towards  holding a summit

Not triple A: sorry this is the cult formerly known as The Plain White Tee’s

Me: great okay cool I’d like 2 large fries and an oil change plz
8403 2018-05-28 04:50:49 That’s just over half of a barrel of oil.  Not news.
8404 2018-05-28 04:50:32 Gas prices have climbed and would have climbed higher if it wasn’t for President Trump. The Saudis were planning $100 a barrel fit oil, but Trump tweeted a kind of threat to them and decided at $80 a barrel. The economy is booming right now.

8413 2018-05-28 04:49:18 But anyway this dependency haunts us hard. Better govt invest in overseas oil assets and 20% ethanol rather than 10% policy as it creates employment.

8415 2018-05-28 04:48:57 Again sa 14 pesos na increase sa local oil price, 2 pesos lang ang sa Train Law, the rest world market factor. Ang inflation nasa 4.5% pa rin. Di mo kailangan maging magaling sa math or economist para maitindihan yun, or else mas BOBO ka!

ALSO, 4.5% increase in inflation is historically low.

8577 2018-05-28 04:19:02 Fuel prices are hiked for 15th consecutive day and the obvious reason will be crude oil price. But why was the prices not lowered when crude was at 48$ @narendramodi . Every tax payer is suffering from these hikes. #DissapointedByCentralGovt

8580 2018-05-28 04:18:45 Such oil can be nice but often seems irrational to me; why very expensive imported oil when lard, bacon, or a pork chop is the same? Just put some bacon on salad, or melt some lard in many cases
8581 2018-05-28 04:18:44 @narendramodi respected sir. I am one of your biggest fans. When crude oil was rising I am understand that petrol prices as to go up. But when the crude is down 6% in two days still the prices are increased. I fail to understand that. This is not fair for middle class please help
8582 2018-05-28 04:18:38 sorry they own all the oil companies 
8583 2018-05-28 04:18:27 I’d probably be ok with that.

8594 2018-05-28 04:16:03 Before we talk about the Saudi and Russia comments about curbing #crudeoil production cuts, not that the 5Y,5Y forward is down 10 bps since May 1.

5Y and 10Y inflation breakeven are fading as well from 4 year highs.

Not good for an over-levered, one sided market. #oil
8595 2018-05-28 04:15:53 Fuel prices are Rs. 80+. Where is all these public money going? Look at oil marketing companies like IOCL. Their profit for first 3 months of 2018 is around Rs. 5300 crores. For whole year it is likely to be around 20,000 crores. All oil companies may make around one lakh crores
8596 2018-05-28 04:15:51 Wow. The price has dropped to how much pls? And how come Benin import Demand of same rice suddenly increased by over 100%?

8621 2018-05-28 04:12:10 I never said to stop oil & gas immediately. I know that's not possible. However we can start implementing lots of green energies while decreasing our dependency on oil & gas--I'm talking about Canada, not the whole planet. We can be an example.

8706 2018-05-28 03:59:20 Iran has absolutely nothing to do with our fuel price. We don’t buy their oil. They don’t have enough to set the price. The sanctions didn’t go away just because we left the deal. The other countries still sanction them. We sell oil now instead of buying it.
8707 2018-05-28 03:59:09 I have to put oil in my hair like everyday other day or else it’s dry af, but it always moves down to face and makes my face oily and my face isn’t dry, so I just break out from too much oil like wahhhhhhaaagh

8716 2018-05-28 03:58:14 How about YOU getting out of the way of the oil industry Senator? If Trump could control oil prices you would call him a dictator.

Maybe you should consult president Carter on what he did.

That's right. He did do something. He handed out "Whip Inflation Now" buttons.
8717 2018-05-28 03:57:33 One thing that has helped me in my IF is to eat a CRAZY amount of salad, leafy greens, low carb vegetables, and avocados (like they’re going out of style!). And do not be afraid to douse your salad/veggies with olive oil (uncooked) or avocado oil (cooked) and sea salt!

8727 2018-05-28 03:56:20 It seems all the liberals want to blame our great president when something goes wrong they blame the getting out of the Iran deal but we only get a fraction of our oil from Iran but to them it’s better to find a way to blame trump get over it he is our president

8829 2018-05-28 03:46:26 Real shame that oil spills are so easily accepted and expected. How our expectations have dipped.

8831 2018-05-28 03:46:10 Frankly you clearly lack the cognitive abilities to think rationally about this topic and fall into the emotive conspiracy theory traps that woo woo and snake oil peddlers want you to believe.

8837 2018-05-28 03:45:29 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8838 2018-05-28 03:45:19 Funny how the quote and headline identifies an oil spill. Don't mislead the public. It was a spill of bunker fuel caused by a bad transfer between the ship and the fuel barge. Report the facts, and clearly.

8854 2018-05-28 03:44:01 Shares of state-run oil marketing companies--BPCL, HPCL  and Indian Oil Corporation--will be watched after petrol and diesel prices  continued to rise for the 15th straight day as state-run oil marketers increased  rates in line with crude oil prices.
8855 2018-05-28 03:44:01 Possibly but then again you could say the same thing about Obama when gas was almost $4 it really just is how much money the oil companies wanna profit from this month.
8856 2018-05-28 03:43:57 @pnvijay Sir I still don't understand the logic of fuel price increase everyday as oil imported everyday is not reaching the pump, also the pump is having stock of 3/4 days in their sump, then by this increase everyday who is ultimately gaining-the oil company or the dealer?
8857 2018-05-28 03:43:34 I really can’t wait until she marries a swarthy oil prince. This right here is SO low rent.
8858 2018-05-28 03:43:20 Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Monday as investors digested the latest developments regarding North Korea and Italian politics. Crude oil extended losses as traders braced for output increases.
8859 2018-05-28 03:43:15 An extremely nervous Nat, runs off to find this Mystikal hardening oil. About 20 minutes goes by and half of the truck is on the ground as she scrambles to search for it. She says to me in a panic voice that she can't find it. Then another voice behind me pipes up very angrily!
8860 2018-05-28 03:43:10 Yea, spend 20 bucks on your planner old lady so i can keep putting unleaded in my hand-me-down altima with nearly 200,000 miles. And while you at it give me a moment to do my own oil change because i cant afford to pay for a 20 dollar oil change

8865 2018-05-28 03:42:45 I am talking abt listing 25%-30%, which together with a golden share would mean GOM will still have complete management and shareholding control over the golden goose and its future. Besides, oil is going to run out in the not too distant future. Does any1 have a better solution?
8866 2018-05-28 03:42:44 my cousin just gave me peppermint oil for my migraine and WOW MY LIFE HAS NOW CHANGED IM A NEW PERSON
8867 2018-05-28 03:42:23 Actually Dianne you are again wrong MMS is industrial strength bleach and is harmful to give to children particularly in the dosage that the snake oil conmen peddling this recommend. It’s also not a cure for autism , cancer or anything else that theses conmen claim it cures.

8895 2018-05-28 03:40:07 Oil prices have fallen sharply since friday. Brent may have made a major peak around $80. 

Even rupee has gained sharply bcoz of that. Looks like USD/INR will not break 69 in days to come.

Further rupee depreciation should now depend on RBI policy & US Fed policy next month.
8896 2018-05-28 03:39:58 The difference in tax level compared to the US with gasoline refined from oil extracted in Canada is insane, and the higher cost is hitting Canadians on everything they buy.  That’s still the issue here and it needs to be addressed.

8971 2018-05-28 03:28:08 My maid is impossible. She will tell me things in installments.

She will give a long list of things, once those things arrive she is like "oh, get oil also".

Arey!! Like you mad bro?
8972 2018-05-28 03:28:06 This should be taken in context with Musk's recent argument against special interest oil and car manufacturers utilizing media to "spread rumors about Tesla" Hes referring to these special interest groups - You puppy, are making the race jump here.
8973 2018-05-28 03:28:02 Baby oil. Soak it in baby oil and rub it off after a lil while

8981 2018-05-28 03:26:57 I take 6oz of calamine lotion mixed with three caps of witch hazel and 8 drops of tea tree oil. I shake it up and rub it on with cotton gauze. Let it dry. Sleep and I rinse off in the morning.

This is called Phoebe’s Remedy, also effective in draining cysts.
8982 2018-05-28 03:26:55 Two things come to mind. One, we could have given the 150 billion that Obama gave Iran, to the taxpayers to buy gas. Two, we should pump our own OIL so we don’t have to be held hostage by the OPEC cartel.

8988 2018-05-28 03:26:10 OIL selling off again tonight--commercials have been massively short since Nov 2017 and it took close to 7 months for the selloff to occur--those who worship ONLY at the COT alter and were shorting since Dec Jan Feb  got blown up!!!
8989 2018-05-28 03:26:09 2 of the worst races happened today.  Indy is a speed race and no technical ability is required. Monaco GP is even more boring as there is nowhere to pass. A guy had 90% power and won the race because he was on pole.
8990 2018-05-28 03:26:08 On May 28, 2018 the issued SOCO van of Olongapo City CLO was subjected to change oil for preventive maintenance of the said vehicle.

8992 2018-05-28 03:25:55 bread and olive oil
8993 2018-05-28 03:25:50 Vancouver gets pissed off when that happens because then the gas or oil gets underneath the sewage and Floats it to the top. And they just hate that..

- Oil Pulling. Take one tbsp of coconut oil and swish it around your mouth for 5-20 minutes. Rinse well and drink a glass or two of water afterwards. Oil Pulling is an Indian remedy that serves as a natural teeth whitener.

9000 2018-05-28 03:24:31 Agree. The 2016 Campaign turned many off the cuff comments into viscous rally cry. The Trump voter watched him on TV&in their ignorance bought his snake oil as a fix for everything from healthcare to foreign policy.Thx for response. We could have had Brilliant HRC.

9002 2018-05-28 03:24:14 #NIFTY seems to have found near term bottom. Buying seen in broader markets on Friday lifting Midcap and Smallcap indices a bit. Two major factors to watchout in next few months : Crude oil and Rupee. Brent crude above 80$ & Rupee above 69 could bring more pain for Indian
9003 2018-05-28 03:24:10 Maybe all day tubbing trips are a bad idea because I feel like my skin is about to fall off. Or maybe I should stop putting on baby oil. Idk.

Why not fix excise & VAT at ₹/litre instead of %age on Petrol & Diesel every year? It will insulate to a great extent both govt. & consumers from Crude oil price volatility.

9037 2018-05-28 03:18:42 True, main reason we changed vehicle & driving habits were recent major spikes in fuel prices (oligopoly?) in recent years, despite relatively stable oil prices (pre-2015). It is difficult to devise a system to reward conservation directly without using the market for delivery.

9047 2018-05-28 03:17:26 Google CBD oil and read about it. There's some pretty decent material on it out there. Watch out for the snake oil type sites, I think some of them discuss Fibro pain being relieved with it. Lots of info for me to narrow. 
9048 2018-05-28 03:17:22 Not true for everyone. I've been told this all my life. I wash my hair every 3rd day. Still greasy as fuck five hours after washing it and just gets worse. Some people just produce more oil. Dry shampoo is great though.

9074 2018-05-28 03:14:24 When oil spills are reported by media in liters it makes it look bigger then it actually is.  Take 100 liters of vegetable oil and spill it on the ground. It’s not significant and can be cleaned up very quickly. It’s only reported due to circumstance.
9075 2018-05-28 03:14:22 @LivingLibations makes an oil w multiple oils that have natural spf and also another one that contains zinc oxide :))

9078 2018-05-28 03:13:33 Hey @GTWScar just watched your latest FoolCraft video and I think I have a solution to your creosote problem. The crude oil which you found can be refined into Naptha using a Fractionating Still which will give tar as a 100% secondary output.

You’re one of the few whose willing to give Iran nukes and cash to save a buck.

9085 2018-05-28 03:12:49 Those OPEC countries look so good . To have oil is everything i guess.
9086 2018-05-28 03:12:48 Have you read the article in question or Musk's tweet? You're so easily led. And why so much outrage over this? Oil companies have nearly daily spills, have lengthy history of environmental crimes, but our focus is on Musk's RT. Do you wonder why?
9087 2018-05-28 03:12:47 Do you having any lemon essential oil? I’m all out and I’d like some lemonade.

9098 2018-05-28 03:11:06 The #OOTTmoron named @Alanoneilll kept pushing on Friday that you should be buying oil because "Iran and Venezuela was still in the news". These are the kind of idiots you'll find on #OOTT. Maybe they're hedge fund backed or just dumb #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F

9109 2018-05-28 03:10:15 edibles is a good idea. CBD oil may benefit you. There is no THC in CBD oil. Meaning no hallucinogenic SE's. No high, either. But it does work for pain, anxiety, relaxing, ect. It's legal in every state and comes in many different ways to ingest.
9110 2018-05-28 03:10:08 Alvarez: Fuel excise tax only contributed a fraction of oil price hike; P3 in gas retail prices; P2.8 in diesel prices @manilabulletin
9111 2018-05-28 03:10:06 But oil is 66.23 off another 2.4%So I would be showing some confidence at this point see
9112 2018-05-28 03:09:21 me: where’s the coconut oil

9115 2018-05-28 03:08:28 My skin is living its best life because of Drunk Elephant and 100% squalane oil #issaglow #teamnozits #teamnowrinkles #teamdewyaf
9116 2018-05-28 03:08:18 Still the whole country should benefit from higher oil. Issue also is he usd debt
9117 2018-05-28 03:08:13 I hope the company that makes Lebron James's favorite beard oil decides they wanna go in another direction and that despite trying many alternatives, he never finds one that he likes as much.

9121 2018-05-28 03:07:43 “Self-made” is ridiculous thing to say about anyone in oil and gas business. So many government subsidies, protections, sweetheart leases, public lands handed over.
9122 2018-05-28 03:07:34 Want smooth shiny legs? Use sugar and coconut oil. Mix and apply to legs and shave thank me later.

9124 2018-05-28 03:07:18 thanks to julian, coconut oil, argon oil, leave in conditioner, and my willpower to not put heat on my hair, my curls are back and my hair is getting LONG. Love my life thank u & goodnight.
9125 2018-05-28 03:07:11 Why the dishonesty? Ignore those false 2014 reports. The recent factual ones show worse mistreatment of immigrants under new Trump policy, NOT Obama. Get your head out of the political game for a second.
9126 2018-05-28 03:07:06 May automatic suspension mechanism ang TRAIN sa oil, when price reach $80 and stay above for specific period. Mababawi mo na yung 2 pesos mo after nun.
PS: babalikan kita pag nagnormalize na yung oil price para mahinge ule feedback mo :)
9127 2018-05-28 03:07:02 You start showing ritual and theology, you're gonna let slip a "Pour thine wrath upon the nations who know thee not" or a "You are called man, they are not called man", or a bread-oil-wine rule... 
(I half-kid)
9128 2018-05-28 03:07:02 O custo não mexeu desde os 80 dólares...  Se cair 3% dolar e oil a 74 empata kkkkkk
9129 2018-05-28 03:07:00 @DanielNewman  I need all your guys help, my husband may be losing his toe or foot i know it sounds funny but he is diabetic, I need 10 people who want to try cbd oil for pain, anxiety, or depression
9130 2018-05-28 03:06:26 Cool video. Though I retained probably about 5% of it. I can’t hardly get through the day without MCT oil.
9131 2018-05-28 03:06:20 A bartender at Italian Village explained to me once that you can put parmesan in the olive oil and dip you bread in it.

9135 2018-05-28 03:05:52 Lebron been using the fuck outta some miracle drops and wild growth oil.
9136 2018-05-28 03:05:30 My room is so warm, my coconut butter turned into coconut oil.
9137 2018-05-28 03:05:29 Let’s get rid of all oil, shall we?
9138 2018-05-28 03:05:17 arreaza es torpe USA no busca detener ninguna decision del pueblo de ser libre busca detener la decision de la trampa del CNE y la ANC en davor de maduro y sus falsos 6 millones de votos.

9148 2018-05-28 03:04:32 Well,,,, let’s go @GoldenKnights OIL IT UP BABY!!
9149 2018-05-28 03:04:30  bruh I’m dead lmao. RT @variopicasso: @Itseppsnshit  “I meant to take your car for the oil change but what happened was Earl came over and said his octopus had a stroke, I had to help him”
9150 2018-05-28 03:04:15 You mean, “Franklin Graham to hold 10 rallies in California to urge racists faux Christians to vote.” @Franklin_Graham is a snake oil salesman. Nothing more.
9151 2018-05-28 03:04:03 And before 2500 homes plus offices and retail are built on the former Imperial Oil Lands, that infrastructure should be built, not after.
9152 2018-05-28 03:03:45 I bet the mozzarella sticks are seasoned with truffle oil, the bougiest of flavors.
9153 2018-05-28 03:03:37 Try the milk cleanser of muji and their face soap (actually all muji cleansers are good especially the oil) I used to use cetaphil din but my skin cleared a lot when I stopped using it
9154 2018-05-28 03:03:35 10th day of work in a row and I got an oil burn on my forehead I need comfort food
9155 2018-05-28 03:03:35 They lie to people (freedom, democracy ) then they enter the country kill the leader take all the oil there  . But you know Donald trump he is moody you don’t understand the way he thinks 
9156 2018-05-28 03:03:10 I love new world because there was no oil that I wouldn't have to fight for
9157 2018-05-28 03:03:09 aioli is technically a garlic/olive oil sauce...but many ppl use egg to thicken it. I mean mayo is just egg & oil, really. so yeah...but aioli is popular in Canada

9160 2018-05-28 03:03:01 you had me at roasted cauliflower, tbh. how do you treat it? olive oil, salt, lemon juice, red pepper flake, etc?
9161 2018-05-28 03:03:00 Last time Lebron didn’t make the finals, Obamacare was being signed into law and BP oil was spilled all over the gulf
9162 2018-05-28 03:02:23 I completely agree that we should prosecute people who abuse social welfare programs. It costs us millions. Let's start right after we address the CORPORATE welfare that costs us billions. Does big oil, with its 5B yearly profit, really need subsidies AND pay no taxes, eg?
9163 2018-05-28 03:02:13 Heard earlier tonight from @KirstyDuncanMP at Congress 2018 re: the Trudeau government's respect for science. This is the same government that scorns climate science to court the interests of Big Oil in BC - on unceded First Nations lands to boot #CongreSSH #StopKM #idlenomore
9164 2018-05-28 03:02:09 I support you, Steven. Don’t give in to the dirty and faul play by Chevron or any others from Big Oil. You know how important your work is to so many people. Hopes and vibes from DK.
9165 2018-05-28 03:01:57 one stock to watch today is Ramkrishna forging 
Very strong earnings
Revenues soar 57% led by 41% tonnage growth
Margins up 430 bps YoY to 20.8% 
Surge in north america class 8 truck demand led to revenue growth
Strong mhcv and oil and gas demand also led to better performance
9166 2018-05-28 03:01:48 Use oil
9167 2018-05-28 03:01:45  “I meant to take your car for the oil change but what happened was Earl came over and said his octopus had a stroke, I had to help him”
9168 2018-05-28 03:01:43 Oil (-): Producers said they're looking to boost output. Russia says one option is to return to production levels initially agreed upon in 2016. OPEC+ believes mkt re-balanced in Apr, w/ OECD stockpiles 20mb below 5yr-avge - people familiar
9169 2018-05-28 03:01:31 The sheamoisture Manuka honey and manfura oil intensive hydration masque is the truth.
9170 2018-05-28 03:01:30 Jersey is ass. This heating oil shit is wack. A nigga wants GAS. This electric stove is corny af
9171 2018-05-28 03:01:21  Bet a hot oil treatment?
9172 2018-05-28 03:01:14 Oil should not be traded!  It should not be on the commodities market.  Unfair to the consumer!!!

9176 2018-05-28 03:00:51 Sir the amount spent on all these functions to just talk can be averted...use the same money spent on bhashanbazi on reducing the oil prices...it is killing common man
9177 2018-05-28 03:00:42 Fact checking: No 8 straight for Jordan.? My google machine is low on oil.

9182 2018-05-28 03:00:24 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
9183 2018-05-28 03:00:06 My car starts fine but I got an oil change and they were like we recommend getting a new battery ? I’ve never replaced my battery but I bought my car in 2015 ! I can’t answer the rest of the water questions because idk??
9184 2018-05-28 03:00:04 The stupid is strong in this one.
9185 2018-05-28 03:00:03 Hey, I’m looking for statistics. It’s less than one percent, either way.
9186 2018-05-28 03:00:02 This is an all natural oil! I get off of amazon, I won’t use anything else. I refuse to use orajel and those teething tablets.
9187 2018-05-28 03:00:01 yes boleh cuma maksud dia, kalau xpakai any sun protection, rosehip oil xkan dpt elakkan sunburn? gitu la i rasa maksud dia
9188 2018-05-28 03:00:01 Pulpo a la gallega (Galician-style octopus) , is cooked in boiling water (preferably in a copper cauldron or pan) and served hot in oil
9189 2018-05-28 02:59:58 Yeah what if it got to the water? We can play what ifs all day but the point is--it was a spill. Twinning pipelines doesn't solve it. We also need to invest in renewables--could use that as backup as we get off oil. Technology is there. Just need political will.
9190 2018-05-28 02:59:45 Why are you stockpiling cans of motor oil and queso sauce #QuestionsImAlwaysAsked
9191 2018-05-28 02:59:42 I guess  shit is slick like oil & Kenzie is too! 
9192 2018-05-28 02:59:38 I'm loving it. Has this moved FE much? I'm hoping for us to get under 60. But if we are near the end of this cycle, then it's all good. Long live Jimboman! Long live.....T.H.O.H.!!!! #THOH
9193 2018-05-28 02:59:38 Also when dollar oil correlation snaps seems oil is correcting to maintain correlation?
9194 2018-05-28 02:59:37 Gotta keep their Saudi oil managers happy. The elite in capitalism and medieval Islam have a symbiotic dependency.
9195 2018-05-28 02:59:34 I hope this could mean the global oil price will go down
9196 2018-05-28 02:59:15 Like I can deal if it's masked by something like a burger, but like how do people just blob it on stuff?? Like it's just a wad of blended oil and eggs??
9197 2018-05-28 02:59:13 relationship=oil me=water ..  WE DONT MIX obviously 
9198 2018-05-28 02:59:08 Sangria , bread and balsamic/olive oil/vegan parm mix 
9199 2018-05-28 02:58:58 So  now we are going to start reporting now when my car leaks a few drops of oil. Holy shit
9200 2018-05-28 02:58:57 Yes I do prefer olive oil than milk...
9201 2018-05-28 02:58:54 CHEERS WE POPPIN THE BIGGEST BOTTLES TONIGHT

9202 2018-05-28 02:58:44 Oil industry just took off what planet are you living on? Haven’t you looked at gas prices lately have you just check the price of oil lately? There is no such thing as clean coal!
9203 2018-05-28 02:58:28 @dailytelegraph "midnight oil yobs" Peter Garrett, whilst minister in charge of the failed home insulation Program, is also responsible for the bankruptcy of businesses. His time in office did nothing but destroy ppls lives!
9204 2018-05-28 02:58:24 ,Being Boo’d u  would feel so good right now, with a blunt,and a Nasty baby oil Booty rub
9205 2018-05-28 02:58:08 I was throwing chain on an oil rig offshore in 19XX and I did something really stupid, that could have cost me my left hand. Someone yelled at me and used really angry words!
9206 2018-05-28 02:58:06 舞台化……
9207 2018-05-28 02:57:58 Oil prices will rise and fall, but democrats taxing the living shit out of those least able to afford it will continue forever.

9212 2018-05-28 02:57:33 Every since I stared using coconut oil instead of lotion on Amina her skin is sooo much softer
9213 2018-05-28 02:57:32 The scariest part about it Howard, the guy is doing it on fumes.
9214 2018-05-28 02:57:24 Every night I gotta put Shea butter on my feet and coconut oil to my skin lol
9215 2018-05-28 02:57:19 Kinda weird that companies that don’t make olive oil, have better olive oil than companies that do. ?truth?
9216 2018-05-28 02:57:13 We just got her necklace in! I’ll look into the oil!! I’ve just seen on the news how they said teething medicine isn’t good for babies so I’ve been scared about orajel and stuff
9217 2018-05-28 02:57:11 The one who plays Solo looks more like a "would you like fries wit dat?" guy vs a Space Cowboy. And the other looks like he'd change your oil vs being a Space Pimp. Neither of them have any charisma to pull off the shoes they're stepping into.
9218 2018-05-28 02:57:08 ไม่ได้ไปอ่ะเสียดาย รอบหน้าจะไม่พลาด
9219 2018-05-28 02:57:03 I am sorry sir that you have had to suffer #spygate. Your accomplishments are already extremely productive, reducing crazy obscene liberal regulations on business. You unleashed oil production. You’re just getting started!! These crazy loser Democrats are about to go to DOWN!!
9220 2018-05-28 02:56:25 My mom and sis owe me money bc we pitched in for my brothers bday gift and I was thinking of using that money for my car oil change BUT to be completely honest..... my skin needs an intense spa facial 
9221 2018-05-28 02:56:15 @dailytelegraph "midnight oil yobs" Peter Garrett never represented anyone but him self. Never did anything for his country or constituents. Lied to the Insulation industry & is partly responsible for 3 deaths & 1 serious injury within the Home insulation Program!
9222 2018-05-28 02:56:09 So tender my heart

9227 2018-05-28 02:55:12 But here the problem is..... when rise is the Oil Co pass over rise at lightening  speed...when there is fall they taje own sweet time to pass over reduction
9228 2018-05-28 02:55:07 i’ve been gone all day srry lol today i bought some argan oil 2 vonnegut books (breakfast of champions and hocus pocus) and kafka’s metamorphosis and also i showed my hives to my mom and she thinks i’m dying and need to go to th doc immediately
9229 2018-05-28 02:55:00 Less than 1 whole BARREL of oil. 
Probably more gas drips per day at your average gas station.
9230 2018-05-28 02:54:53 You fried the pasta and rice? Like in a frying pan with oil?
9231 2018-05-28 02:54:31 Pasata di ceci hits all the bases.Puree up cooked chickpeas w tomatoes (tinned or fresh). Put a generous slug of olive oil in a saute pan & warm it.Add some sliced/ crushed garlic, let it warm in the oil (but not fry).Stir in the pureed mixture & warm it all through.Season & eat.
9232 2018-05-28 02:54:13 okay so i like the idea of an extra page but i did funny stuff instead of like....more data. too much data already. andddd what else would you add besides like kizuna ai, the oil dance cover, the soldier game fc with sausages
9233 2018-05-28 02:53:53 If you love me ask how cbd oil can help you :)
9234 2018-05-28 02:53:36 Cbd oil has helped with my constant infections, pms, headaches, stress,anxiety, depression and sleep and regrow my hair.
9235 2018-05-28 02:53:33 That pass was too much...
9236 2018-05-28 02:53:18 Cost, $0
Terrorists traded, 0
#MAGA  #winning
9237 2018-05-28 02:53:16 Oil getting slammed. $OSH holding up far better than $WPL so probably a better short for the momentum.
9238 2018-05-28 02:52:42 add eucalyptus oil if you have some!!!
9239 2018-05-28 02:52:40 Royale Royale uh, half pint motor oil uh
9240 2018-05-28 02:52:32 You've had to much #TRUMP snake oil.
9241 2018-05-28 02:52:28 หวีดจนจะตายแล้วเนี่ย
9242 2018-05-28 02:52:06 I'll trust the folks whose full time job and reason for living is tracking the oil market over CNBC. I respect areas of professional expertise,
9243 2018-05-28 02:52:00 Crude oil never rots. It will still remain in those storage tanks until all the necessary legal processes and procedures are adhered to. Turkana leaders should not force things happen. Nature, if not people , will not accept.
9244 2018-05-28 02:51:53 .....it tells us that either Oil or interest rates, on a comparative basis, are still too high.
9245 2018-05-28 02:51:30 In the short term but not in the long term. Saudi arabia, for example, has massive oil deposits and yet a quarter of saudi arabians claim to live in squalor. And they don't have an embargo on them. This is due to bad governance, now compare that to Cuba, resources are being....
9246 2018-05-28 02:51:28 some black seed essential oil vs the masciares

9248 2018-05-28 02:51:20 Anyone who doesn't is probably afraid of being shot.
9249 2018-05-28 02:51:05 No more rethoric, we are waiting for oil embargo and military intervention.

9251 2018-05-28 02:50:51 Coconut oil is trash.
9252 2018-05-28 02:50:44 Why B J P Govt. is hesitating to take decision on controlling oil prices ! No point killing people by collecting fund from one source there are other ways also to generate funds for which govt. must think or take opinion from experts.
9253 2018-05-28 02:50:11 Obama released oil from the reserves.
9254 2018-05-28 02:50:05 Anything from Shea Moisture (they have a leave in conditioner and a curl "smoothie"), Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, Moroccan oil, and argan oil
9255 2018-05-28 02:50:05 Lol, limited oil reserves?  Ha. 
Not even close to the truth. 
Hat flavor is that Kool aid your drinking?
9256 2018-05-28 02:50:00 Posibleng cartel sa oil products, sisilipin ng DOE
9257 2018-05-28 02:49:57 Well this tweet did not work as you probably expected reading through the responses.
9258 2018-05-28 02:49:44 The messaging by OPEC + is too much of a shift to be true. There must be a concern that a rising usd will hurt emerging economies who borrow in usd.  Opec may be acting like a global bank to keep the economy (and demand for oil) growing until the usd drops.
9259 2018-05-28 02:49:41 The vow

9263 2018-05-28 02:49:27 lavender and coconut oil bubble bath gives me life 
9264 2018-05-28 02:49:22 Dumali ang bobo. Oil shouldn't have been included in the TRAIN LAW at all. Taasan nyo na ang tax sa ibang bagay lalo na ang local produce, total babalik naman un e. Pero ang langis na kayang maapektuhan lahat? Gago lang gagawa nun. Un ang point incase di mo p din gets.
9265 2018-05-28 02:49:21 Que pasa ? extrañas el gobierno de PPKutra , traidor ala patria hasta en su ultimo momento de su miserable mandato quiso hacer su ultimo lobby , ( Tullow Oil) , reacciono Vizcarra y lloran las viudas
9266 2018-05-28 02:49:09 Monday greeted me with oil prices and taxes
9267 2018-05-28 02:49:05 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
9268 2018-05-28 02:48:59 You crazy for this one. It's just garlic oil they're calling butter.
9269 2018-05-28 02:48:56 Soros... Sorostits... that’s like a Medical term., hard to pronounce.. What do you think of “Soritus”or “Sorass”
9270 2018-05-28 02:48:47 lathering your whole body in coconut oil.... omg best feeling ever 
9271 2018-05-28 02:48:35 Bhai India is a oil importer not producer, prices are decided by OPEC not India, don't fall prey to the Congi propoganda!
9272 2018-05-28 02:48:35 Favorite oils - tea tree oil for face (acne scars) coconut oil for moisturizing body(also sugar scrub exfoliator) and castor oil for hair growth.
9273 2018-05-28 02:48:34 I need some baby oil
9274 2018-05-28 02:48:32 If it was overseas they were probably fighting for American oil interests.
9275 2018-05-28 02:48:29 tea tree oil as a spot treatment works good cause it doesn’t try you out super bad ! but reduces the size and redness of them (for me anyways)
9276 2018-05-28 02:48:21 I’m pulling from life around me?  The oil industry just took off, the coal Industry just took off, unemployment is at al all time low, black unemployment is at the lowest it has EVER been.  These are numbers from the CBO- there were NOT millions laid off after the tax cut?
9277 2018-05-28 02:48:17 I applied this super expensive  skinceuticals oil on my face and I think it's breaking me out I got this big ass zit on my jaw now and I never get zits there I'm so sad :,(
9278 2018-05-28 02:48:14 Going through about 3 cups of black oil sunflower seeds each day! The backyard birding is lit right now.
9279 2018-05-28 02:47:39 No, you just keep threatening to put your clothes back on.
9280 2018-05-28 02:47:39 Lavender oil is the move tonight! 
9281 2018-05-28 02:47:29 i will look into this one.. just got a bunch of tea tree oil stuff to try to help with my skin problems (a soap, a cream, a spray.. along with a sulfur cream and soap also)
9282 2018-05-28 02:47:29 Lay off the soy
9283 2018-05-28 02:47:17 Oil companies paid the wrong parties, they invested in the Conservatives, should have support every party equally
9284 2018-05-28 02:46:59 Shower number two of the day; brought to you by bug spray, tanning oil, sand and campfire.
9285 2018-05-28 02:46:52 But would you?
9286 2018-05-28 02:46:45 You should check under the hood to make sure everything is in place....then check her oil. 
9287 2018-05-28 02:46:45 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
9288 2018-05-28 02:46:33 Saudia Arabia said they will fill in any supply needs from our sanctions on Iran oil. US now discovering new energy and we will be fine. Don't you just hate when people with an agenda blow things out of proportion? Chill, we're going to be fine, price increase is very short term
9289 2018-05-28 02:46:12 well i'd have to apply a lil oil or lube first, cuz if not that would be a lil too intense for me.
9290 2018-05-28 02:46:09 I love you! Check na natin baka may oil & garlic special sa fountain hahahahaha.
9291 2018-05-28 02:46:08 For those of you that saw the Exxon Mobil commercial earlier, they had over 3500 oil spills in just NYS alone and they are not paying to have them cleaned up. Instead, the financial burden goes to the tax payers #CAVSvsCELTICS #ijs #nypirg
9292 2018-05-28 02:46:06 Respect fully I will tell you that millions of citizens were murdered in Iraq. This is uncontested and factual as well as the US petro industry pumping oil from Iraq.
9293 2018-05-28 02:46:00 When China invests in Canadian oil, bigger isn’t always better 
Another low-down attempt at China bashing? What a waste of talent if really there..
9294 2018-05-28 02:45:55 To extrapolate that to the broader world is total nonsense.  There are tons of survey data on the political affiliations of teachers and the media. They are by far left-wing.  But, I admit, I haven't seen any surveys on oil change guys so you got me there.
9295 2018-05-28 02:45:52 I can do you one better. in middle school i was expected to recreate an oil PAINTING with oil PASTELS. i wanted to die every day of that project and it has kicked off a horrible hatred of oil pastels since.
9296 2018-05-28 02:45:51 BC is doing fine. Alberta was too before oil crashed
9297 2018-05-28 02:45:41 Maybe you are not an E-SCAM-illa
9298 2018-05-28 02:45:38 I like the taste of beef...no marinated steaks here...olive oil, salt and little pepper.
9299 2018-05-28 02:45:26 Lavender oil
9300 2018-05-28 02:44:49 Miss Bagua ardida por que se cayo el lobby de PPK   referente a contratos de licencia que benefician a Tullow Oil , millones en coimas al tacho.
9301 2018-05-28 02:44:39 A lil shout out to the butt plug who left a leaky ass bottle of oil n didn’t bother telling anyone 
9302 2018-05-28 02:44:38 Not to mention the fact that the plot of Mad Max revolves around a scarcity of oil, and an existential battle to acquire "the precious juice". #bcpoli
9303 2018-05-28 02:44:34 I’ve been trying this new hair method of just oil, conditioner, and water and it’s been blessing me.

Hair soft than a mf, staying moisturized all day, no longer brittle, texture v defined, kinks come out with little to no snapping or breakage, strands have plenty of slip...
9304 2018-05-28 02:44:32 He started every sentence with “my friends”...guess that’s supposed to show he’s “for the people”. Yeah creepy, like a snake oil salesman...

9307 2018-05-28 02:43:42 European stocks ended mixed on Friday as investors mulled a
brewing political crisis in Spain and a fall in oil prices.

9310 2018-05-28 02:43:09 the almond industry is killing off bees which r already dying off a lot, and for eg palm oil is linked to destruction of rainforests which are homes 2 many animals ofc including the orangutan which is already endangered
9311 2018-05-28 02:42:55 Oil stocks extended Thursday’s slide as @ConocoPhillips plunged
4.4%, Halliburton dived 4.0%, Schlumberger sank 3.7%, @Chevron

9315 2018-05-28 02:42:34 you would have a problem if you worked in a machine shop..
Puddles of oil , sharp bits of swarf from the machines 
and LOTS of opportunities to get heavy objects dropped on it or getting it caught in everything from doors to moving machinery.
9316 2018-05-28 02:42:24 coconut oil > baby oil.

9323 2018-05-28 02:40:59 Franklin Graham is another evangelical fraud, con and snake oil salesman, hiding behind religion for his cover.
9324 2018-05-28 02:40:48 It was always about the oil - the only thing Russia can do. 
Hillary wasn’t going to cave to Putin on Syria, just like she called him out on undemocratic elections. 
Now all this crap!
9325 2018-05-28 02:40:40 I wonder what beard oil Lebron uses

9331 2018-05-28 02:39:34 So according to @AndreaHorwath it's "tabloid mud-slinging" when 10 candidates of hers are revealed to be one or all of the following: 1. Israel haters, 2. Hitler meme users, 3. Promoters of misogynistic Women's Oil Wrestling events and 4. Promoters of civil disobedience.
9332 2018-05-28 02:39:24 #Brent Oil is down 7.40% in last few days

9334 2018-05-28 02:39:03 Interesting.....bhp with south flank , Rio needs a new mine , lithium, oil & gas and not to mention the possibility of gold ....Pilbara boom on track again?
9335 2018-05-28 02:39:03 100 litres is 60% of a barrel of oil!  that is less than an oil change. 
come on CBC.   report the news not your propaganda!
9336 2018-05-28 02:38:59 it’s because of that oil spill a long time ago, but still even before that it wasn’t
9337 2018-05-28 02:38:51 Yes on WMDs

Yes on Iraq, but we did not murder civilians

No on oil. Sadly, we actually chose not to take the oil. So we didn't even benefit from that war.

We got rid of a tyrant but left things worse. Iraq was a bad choice at a bad time.
9338 2018-05-28 02:38:33 Average citizens are looking for lucid, reasonable, honest leaders....not debaters. Prowess in debating usually means selling snake oil rather than working for the people.
9339 2018-05-28 02:38:32 Well that’s an easy as hell oil filter to get to at least lol
9340 2018-05-28 02:38:26 How is removing the oil "raping" & killing" the earth?? God created this earth. Do you really think anything man does can destroy it that it wouldn't heal itself?? I believe we are at not risk of an asteroid hitting earth than taking oil from the earth. (cont)
9341 2018-05-28 02:38:19 @elfcosmetics just got the night cream, eye cream, a bottle of foundation, and some lip oil in a color that I love! Definitely switching all my products to E.l.f.!
9342 2018-05-28 02:38:14 Yeah also it doesn’t account for everything.  Like I’ve read that fish oil is better from real food than supplements BUT whey protein supplements are better than protein from meat so... I get confused
9343 2018-05-28 02:38:10 Transfer or head out to the oil field.... decisions decisions 
9344 2018-05-28 02:37:48 No probs. I use Olive Oil and Charcoal  tablets if they are having any stomach problems. Not sure if your doggy has a funny tummy like Jazz.
9345 2018-05-28 02:37:25 lavender oil and eucalyptus oil have the best scents

9348 2018-05-28 02:36:53 If you do get to the WH dont forget us moms like the rest if them do. Moms are the catalyst to stop or start their big oil economies...if they dont satisfy moms soon...TPTB will realize we dont believe their pc mouth fed crap anymore. They wont have a product left to sell us.

9353 2018-05-28 02:35:49 Will you have your shirt on?
9354 2018-05-28 02:35:37 It doesn’t look like Costco’s or Trader Joe’s oil is certified by the NAOOA. I guess that didn’t matter in this ranking?
9355 2018-05-28 02:35:24 oh kbetulan sih aku mau beli face oil. dia efeknya mencerahkan aja ato ada yg lain?
9356 2018-05-28 02:35:20 This is going to be my last tweet . I assume you are aware that there were never any WMD’s In iraq. And we destroyed Iraq and murdered millions of innocent civilians including children. We now pump oil out of Iraq and Dick Cheney And likes own these Oil companies.
9357 2018-05-28 02:35:13 4 big oil and abuse of protesters. I don't regret that and would do it again. All I'm saying is even this core belief, that has been a part of me for 40+ years is shaken, just because of how often our leaders, scientific and otherwise, lie to us.
9358 2018-05-28 02:34:53 True , cme & cboe =price suppression. See gold, silver ,oil. I guess J. Dimon & friends are hard at work , just so they can prove their bubble theory.
9359 2018-05-28 02:34:53 Yup
9360 2018-05-28 02:34:52 Put some black Jamaican castor oil in your baby’s soft spot when they have a cold and watch that mucus/phlegm run like river.

9362 2018-05-28 02:34:47 Just regular cod liver oil. You can get in a Pet Shop. Just a tablespoon to her chow every 3 days. Or a little tuna or sardines in oil with the chow.
9363 2018-05-28 02:33:58 racism starts and ends with control.  it has always been that way.  ppl who think economics plays any role beyond being used as a weapon, in racism, have no clue.  btw, there is no magic elixir or plan to end racism.  any who says they have one is selling snake oil.
9364 2018-05-28 02:33:44 Fuel Price Update

Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise for the 15th straight day as state-run oil marketers increased rates in line with crude oil prices.
9365 2018-05-28 02:33:43 Ok toh kaafi Kam bada hai it seems ...it should be raised to RS 100 per litre ...RS 5 increase /year ... Not subjective to the oil prices which is going down internationally...
9366 2018-05-28 02:33:37 Scientists have been concerned about global warming since the 1900s. "Global cooling" was a fringe theory promoted by the oil companies in the 1970s.
9367 2018-05-28 02:33:32 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]
9368 2018-05-28 02:33:31 It’s less than a barrel. These stupid bastards who report oil volumes in litres for reasons of sensationalism and dishonesty are just that. #cdnpoli
9369 2018-05-28 02:33:28 I found it.HG Wells full name was Hamid Gul Kuwanwalla. He used to dig oil wells. He changed his surname to Wells, so that Brits could employ him.
9370 2018-05-28 02:33:25 Hahaha after my lunch I fall asleep again  but I managed to wake up at around 3.30pm and do my research with mindmaps etc and I managed to finish it within a day  Thank God for enlightenment ! Ah my weekends ... because sat I burnt midnight oil for my report I only managed
9371 2018-05-28 02:33:15 Oh he slicker than a oil spill
9372 2018-05-28 02:33:06 2/... Don't be surprised if they fabricate another war, one that serves duo purposes:  Russia completing task of USA takeover & therefore also winning the Arctic oil.  GOOGLE for articles re. Russia, China, USA, & competition for Arctic OIL (also try adding Russian subs/ships).
9373 2018-05-28 02:33:03 Sorta like those deadly wars started in the name of oil fields conquests 
9374 2018-05-28 02:32:55 Prime News: Energy Stocks Tumble as OPEC Considers Production Increase: Energy stocks in the Asia-Pacific region slid on Monday after news that producer cartel OPEC was mulling to increase production triggered oil prices to tank on Friday.

9376 2018-05-28 02:32:42 Let me know what you think of the other edit I posted - an oil portrait of him when he was in Cannes. I quite like it...!
9377 2018-05-28 02:32:30 My friend, the withdrawal from the Iran deal has destabilized global oil prices. All oil. From everywhere
9378 2018-05-28 02:32:10 Would I hand my wallet to a snake oil salesman who offers nothing of substance besides a well-rehearsed sales pitch? No, I don't think so. #notford

9387 2018-05-28 02:31:08 Btw, there will be another jump around December when refineries switch to winter blends, home heating oil demands rise, and people travel for the holidays.  They drop again when the weather breaks.

9398 2018-05-28 02:30:20 No, let her shart oil…the oil is more useful.
9399 2018-05-28 02:30:18 ...Ghost Nation host in ep 1 this season is where all the action action occurs. And maybe the cortical fluid is part of that somehow? Sort of like the oil in a car engine maybe. And why are you and I the only people who want to know all this? 
9400 2018-05-28 02:30:15 The episode of Its always Sunny when they are trying to sell oil is hilarious 
9401 2018-05-28 02:30:09 Yes, Russia, and the Middle Eastern countries have such high standards on environmental regulation in their Oil and Gas sectors... You ever witnessed our standards compared to theirs? Didn't think so... Nice Troll profile btw!
9402 2018-05-28 02:29:59 Asian stocks drifted at the open, with energy shares tumbling after oil posted its biggest drop in about a year. U.S. stocks fell on lighter than normal volume on Friday heading into the long Memorial Day holiday weekend though S&P 500 futures pointed to gains.

9406 2018-05-28 02:29:47 Ladies , shave your legs with coconut oil !!! Life changing 
9407 2018-05-28 02:29:38 Saudi Arabia and Russia announced a new policy to revive oil production last week. With oil supplies tightening and prices soaring, the two countries agreed to restore some of the output they halted as part of an accord with 22 other producers, drawn from the OPEC and beyond.
9408 2018-05-28 02:29:33 Looks awesome, but you shouldn't eat the croutons (Wheat Belly), or the tomatoes (Plant Paradox) or the shredded cheese (many diet books) and if the Italian dressing is made with canola oil, that should probably go as well... enjoy your lettuce (organic of course)!

9411 2018-05-28 02:29:15 Deer is amazing! Just gotta know how to prep it properly. Usually for venison steaks/roasts I let marinate a few days before cooking (to get the wild taste out) but for ground venison you have to add some kind of fat or oil. Otherwise I'll be too dry.

Gas prices spike at this time every year because the refineries switch production to the summer blends & people travel more.
According to my riders in the oil industry, prices should begin to drop by July as refineries gear back up to full production.
9414 2018-05-28 02:28:29 Gas prices are up 35% year over year, last Memorial Day to now. I also remember @realDonaldTrump #PresidentCooKooBananas telling him #cult followers that HE is responsible for #lowGasPrices now that he has #deregulated the #oil industry. OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER TRUMP LIE. #LiarInChief
9415 2018-05-28 02:28:17 i think majority of women don't make the same choices as men because they have different interests. I personally don't want to (nor my girlfriends) work an oil rig, be a lineman, mechanical engineer, etc. that's not discrimination. that just means not alot of women want to.
9416 2018-05-28 02:28:15 Great cause. Big Oil made it what it is today and is largely the reason why you can participate. FYI, but I’m sure you know that. Can’t wait till you offer how it’s a subversive tactic.
9417 2018-05-28 02:28:10 Sending you good vibes and beard oil (hopefully you’ll be picked up and shaving soon).
9418 2018-05-28 02:27:35 Udah pake face oil sih tapi......
9419 2018-05-28 02:27:22 What supplements do you take to stay healthy? It all seems like expensive BS to me with every expert saying something different. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
…going to start with Athletic Greens, whey, vitamin D & Fish Oil. There's so many though…should I take magnesium too? 
9420 2018-05-28 02:27:15 Don’t gas prices normally spike around Memorial weekend?
I believe the reason is due to maintenance, perhaps we can bail the oil companies out so the can move maintenance window closer to Halloween
9421 2018-05-28 02:27:15 I went to Jiffy Lube in Bell Ca today and they tried to charge me twice the cost of the oil change. Had I not caught there attendants mistake I would have been charged over 210.00 for an oil change . You would think the attendant would have realized he made a mistake. Unhappy

I think he has some sketchy complaints (media bash me because oil companies pay for ads and I don't ) but I think he has valid..

And now they were stuck knowing it.

We are beyond spilled.] What should I make of your return? Besides a thorn upon a rose.
9428 2018-05-28 02:25:50 Probably he wants to be the new ruler of Iran so he can control all the oil
9429 2018-05-28 02:25:46 Having the dino's create oil for us was God's plan don't you think? Why else would He have done that? Did you know animal fat can be used for candles?  Indians would use every part of the buffalo when they hunted. They killed no more than they needed.
9430 2018-05-28 02:25:40 Lol, this is pure bullshit. It is a surcharge on every barrel of oil to be passed on by the oil companies. In essence, this is a tax. This is the best these kids came up with? Millennials.......yikes.

9434 2018-05-28 02:24:38 Do exports...this is a good one...I believe you'll find energy exports alone have grown substantially in the last year (Coal is up 60%) Oil and gas are both up, but will have to research the data. This is all additional economic growth for the country in the last year. Good stuff
9435 2018-05-28 02:24:33 Ugh. Really? I'm losing interest fast.
9436 2018-05-28 02:24:30 i baked why am doing oil

9438 2018-05-28 02:24:19 The transition from acrylic to oil involves so much patience hahaha but totally worth it. I usually get some spray from the art store that can make it dry a lil quicker
9439 2018-05-28 02:24:18 Please don't entertain any kind of excise duty reduction in imported oil.
Now it will act as coerce into giving up pollution. Yes it is a bold step,Now Indian should ponder upon Solar energy schemes and GOBARdhan Yojna to curb pollution .

9440 2018-05-28 02:24:08 Wow oil has doubled in price since the Saudi meeting, which clearly has something to do with the cost, not to mention the Iran Deal pull out
9441 2018-05-28 02:24:07 Hahaha yes, I managed to get it out with coconut oil 
9442 2018-05-28 02:24:06 Oil is also alive, and it knows what you've been saying about it. You've hurt oil's feelings and damaged oil's reputation, and now oil is angry and talking with some other minerals about doing something about it.

9450 2018-05-28 02:22:42 Even on oil prices, we must take into account 2 more things.

1. US Dollar to Rupee was around Rs. 40 - 42 during that period.

2. A big part of our oil supply basket included Iranian oil, which was cheaper due to sanctions.

These first easily make a difference of 50-60%.
9451 2018-05-28 02:22:24 Fuel price going up despite crude oil came dawn to 76$ per barrel from 80$

This is absolutely nonsense

9460 2018-05-28 02:21:23 "Hard work results in success" is the snake oil the successful people have been selling to everybody for decades. You need luck (which could be good genes), connections, and/or family wealth.
9461 2018-05-28 02:20:56 But he's made his view clear elsewhere...he specifically referred to oil interests & big conglomerates.  I think that's bad analysis on his part but not anti-semitism.
9462 2018-05-28 02:20:44 yes...and that is MASS not rural Maine, NH or Vermont. VT and NH are supplimented by nuclear plant in I believe Seabrook NH. Still not enough so power is brought in via Canadian energy sources...which is mostly oil and coal.

9510 2018-05-28 02:13:52 In terms of lakh crores of Corporare loan were alleged to have been waved. I don’t see reasons good enough to burden the public such huge amount. The order should be reverted. Address farmers demand and reduce oil price.

9516 2018-05-28 02:13:08 Only in Comedy, do comedians compete for shortcomings. 

Them: Oh you don’t have a father? My father beat me with a frying pan - dripping with oil!

Me:did he make you eat the food made in it too?” 

Them:yea, how’d you know? 

Me:because your a wussy. You ate food!

CFTC specified record net long positions on #WTI #OIL

Not saying it's going to retreat to $50. 

But again, that report came out at $67/$68

9519 2018-05-28 02:12:49  Well, that sucks extra. I'm sorry. Shall  I drown them in boiling oil for you?

9521 2018-05-28 02:12:34 Sorry to hear this. Is there anything she can take to help? I know some become have great success with CBD oil in at least making them comfy. Is there anyway we can help you? Cards? Donations? Comfy pillows or cozy socks?
9522 2018-05-28 02:12:33 not to be that bitch but coconut oil, coffee grounds and brown sugar is better than most $50 exfoliators (and then u can splurge the money u saved on moisturizers)

9526 2018-05-28 02:12:17 i love getting peppermint/wintergreen (cooling and burning sensations) oil in my eye 
9527 2018-05-28 02:12:16 Kahit anung eksplanasyon at data ang ipakita sa inyo, TRAIN law parin talaga sisihin nyo. Irrational thinking na yan. Payo ko na lang sa inyo, kung nakakapag save lakihan nyo na. Pag umabot ng $100+ ang oil per barrel (like June 2008), mas Lalo kayo iiyak!

9532 2018-05-28 02:11:18 I can't fix an engine but I don';t need "insurance" to pay for an oil change either! I can also take better care of the engine when I know how it works. I don't depend upon the mechanic to repalce the engine iif I don't change the oil either. ..
9533 2018-05-28 02:11:16 Peppermint oil, oil extracted from peppermint leaves.
9534 2018-05-28 02:11:13 @yemialadee does your hands smell like hot oil

9538 2018-05-28 02:10:34 A source in its infancy will soon outstrip the dinosaurs...but those windspills are brutal.

ps. AGCC is real and will cause massive economic and ecological devastation.

ps. Count the cost of military guards and oil gets way more expensive.

ps. The price is climbing...NOW.

9542 2018-05-28 02:10:24 The Celtics are leaking oil.
9543 2018-05-28 02:10:17 ... but the oil prevents the sauce from sticking to the pasta...
9544 2018-05-28 02:10:16 plus you cant blame the NDP for the collapse of oil pricea around the world.

9546 2018-05-28 02:10:06 Hell yeah, i use beard oil on the daily. It is the ultimate FeelsGoodMan. Also recommend beard balm for evenings to deal with knots and split ends. Good beard care is important
9547 2018-05-28 02:10:04 Exactly my point, you support him regardless of his past. However you hate jacklyn because she lied about “mineral oil” or because she hates flying over water? I’m just a little taken aback.
9548 2018-05-28 02:10:00 I know a trader who is buying oil at 66.. and it is like a falling knofe for him. Burnt him twice
9549 2018-05-28 02:09:58 I love my job, I really do, but after reading shit about more responders being stabbed, the scumbag in Aberdeen attempting to take kids, and the oil guy. Makes you question your ethics sometimes. I just don’t get it.
9550 2018-05-28 02:09:48 Pamplemousse? Is that the name of a new essential oil?
9551 2018-05-28 02:09:29 Not just that, there has not yet been time for the oil to be processed, but the gas prices are soaring.  Gouging! #gasprices
9552 2018-05-28 02:09:12 Deforestation is THE single most important cause of climate change. Oil and carbon don't even rate comparison
9553 2018-05-28 02:09:06 @wavecounter my phone got disabled so I cannot access texts or anything. I just saw oil hit $66...NICE!

9557 2018-05-28 02:08:57 I just want a face mask that doesn’t dry my skin out but doesn’t have a ton of oil for fucks sake
9558 2018-05-28 02:08:57 First off, there are non-Jewish family dynasties as well, i.e, Royalty in their respective countries, or Oil tycoons,like the Bush's. "Blue Blood" is the term.  And yeah, a few Jewish families were able to pass on wealth to their children. That does not a vast conspiracy make.

9561 2018-05-28 02:08:48 Hair is supple af! It’s a little drying but I didn’t put enough oil in the mixture. My skin is soft too. I’m definitely doing this face mask twice a week
9562 2018-05-28 02:08:46 @BergmanRacing you gonna be at Red Dirt Raceway in Meeker, Okla next Friday?
9563 2018-05-28 02:08:45 He'd know this because he is the guy who does the oil change. Right after telling you "rain a-coming, you might wanna get them wipers changed out"
9564 2018-05-28 02:08:22 I understand the inside joke but technically washing one's hair every 3-4 days is perfectly ok for people with dry hair or hair treated with chemical often. Washing your hair everyday when you have dry hair makes it even drier since shampoo strips the natural oil.
9565 2018-05-28 02:08:09 I buy Pasture 42 olive oil from the farmers directly, but it's good to know that Kirkland (!!!) receives high marks.
9566 2018-05-28 02:08:03 Did you replaced oil in the transmission box?
9567 2018-05-28 02:08:03 I'm guessing showing her the Sinclair Oil dinosaur ads would just make it worse?

9569 2018-05-28 02:07:57 #CNG Why the govt is not bringing out an ordinance making it compulsory for cars to use gas as a fuel the conversionkit is simple and cheap & can be fitted easily.Prices of Oil are breaking all barriers gas is not only cheaper but is also environment friendly.

9571 2018-05-28 02:07:32 Someone told me that peppermint oil keeps snakes away as well
9572 2018-05-28 02:07:30 Your dad negotiated something with Venezuela.  Hmmmm..... They have oil, and maybe your family doesn’t yet have a hotel there?
9573 2018-05-28 02:07:18 Yet you’ve done nothing about today’s Trans Mountain oil spill in BC.
9574 2018-05-28 02:07:16 If you’re ever eating at someone’s house and they don’t have oil, r u n
9575 2018-05-28 02:06:59 Every time I think Trump’s tweets can’t be any more ridiculous, I am proven wrong.  I am still stunned that so many are fooled by this snake oil salesmen.  Only hope we wake up before it’s too late.
9576 2018-05-28 02:06:58 #CBD oil is an amazing tool to ease symptoms of #anxiety. It naturally calms the CNS, allowing us to return to homeostasis once #triggered, or when feeling overwhelmed. Anxiety is often a result of #trauma & finding #alternativemedicine is much safer than benzodiazepines. 
9577 2018-05-28 02:06:43 Grape seed oil as well
9578 2018-05-28 02:06:32 American Media spreads propaganda to justify the killing of people in the Middle East to gain full control over their oil and land.
9579 2018-05-28 02:06:27 Finally I have learned there is no greater waste of my mental energy, time, and focus then predicting tops and bottoms. Oil predictions are flowing and I'll ignore them as best I can.
9580 2018-05-28 02:06:27 Hmm, it was in pretty clear English on their web site. At any rate, I know that the federal government plans to push it through regardless. And the limited amount of oil that has been spilled is not okay with me. None is.
9581 2018-05-28 02:06:09 Yep.. trump’s done absolutely nothing for the country except benefit the ultra wealthy.. this is just another example.. catering to Big Oil just like the tax cut catered to Big Corporations.. screw the worker & middle class.. and the idiot MAGA trash will still support him 
9582 2018-05-28 02:06:05 Gtfoh.

We havent even tapped the largest oil reserve on the planet.  And it's not in Valenzuela.

9587 2018-05-28 02:04:58 If I’m gullible, why is it I actually understand the science behind climate change and you just repeat the claims made by a tiny number of scientists all of whom conveniently are paid by conservative groups and oil companies? Coincidence? I think not.
9588 2018-05-28 02:04:50 If we're looking at a full retreat, as was had from $66.66, it would take us to ~ $63.50/WTI.  This would be technically significant because it would require a break from the mid-term bullish trend.  Glad I'm not an oil trader!

9590 2018-05-28 02:04:43 What a dipshit
9591 2018-05-28 02:04:41 Expect, gas prices at the pump drop by .20 cents or more by the end of the week.
Crude oil and Brent crude prices continue falling.
Expect in June Russia & Saudi's increase output and decrease tense in Middle East. Also, crude inventory could climb higher.

9595 2018-05-28 02:03:51 Great job!!
9596 2018-05-28 02:03:46 unlike 98% of the human population, we, #wti #oil #brent traders have the power to do something about the constant gas price gouging. we have the ability to compensate for the insanity. use that privilege wisely coz many plebs don't have that chance.

9597 2018-05-28 02:03:46 Liking this oil bloodbath, an easy trade off proper levels and seasonal trend kicking in a week early of course because technicals manipulated by machines, an anti-America phenom that shall be corrected, we can't get to it all til Trump 2nd term.
9598 2018-05-28 02:03:33 hahaha that's my exact point. We don't have enough refining capacity or places to send oil to either as a product or for refining. Sounds like you're starting to get it...
9599 2018-05-28 02:03:32 Used to work in vice sting operations... sounds like something we would investigate.

9604 2018-05-28 02:03:00 Do you plan to make a point, any point, that you can back up? If not, why do you keep coming back?
9605 2018-05-28 02:03:00 @NextRevFNC your young climate warming guest never answered your question. Where does the money come from?

Thank you for giving up and letting him go away. 

Barrel oil cost x per carbon footprint.

Who pays x???? 
9606 2018-05-28 02:02:54 You know it’s summer when your coconut oil is already melted in its jar
9607 2018-05-28 02:02:35 All you have to do is read the news.  For years, OPEC and Russia dumped oil on the market in order to make US produces loose money and exit market.  It wasn’t working, so they both reduced production.
9608 2018-05-28 02:02:29 Full of that oil & fell asleep in the pool on a float 
9609 2018-05-28 02:02:00 whenever I get a migraine I put peppermint essential oil under my nose and it helps so much!
9610 2018-05-28 02:01:42 I think he tries to hard
9611 2018-05-28 02:01:30 stop hit at 65.95. 

we'll stay up all night to see where this goes. 

we do have an early stop tomorrow. could be fun.

9619 2018-05-28 02:00:41 I sold my car in 2014

But price of oil was never as high as 2008. Carbon taxes don't do jack shit to impact the price of oil, do they? Because if they did, figured cons would never have implemented them.
9620 2018-05-28 02:00:36 Oil prices fell on Monday, extending a steep decline in the previous session, as the market eyed an increase in output from the world's three top crude producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia.

9623 2018-05-28 01:59:39 Some of the oils in beard oils might be good. Argan, jojoba. Almond oil, maybe. (Beard oil is as much for the face skin as it is for the beard)
9624 2018-05-28 01:59:28 It's always about stealing, stealing oil, gas, resources -stealing whilst pretending not to be stealing
9625 2018-05-28 01:59:27 I just want my scalp rubbed down with some oil and massaged put me right to sleep
9626 2018-05-28 01:59:16 It seems like the ball is super slick, like it's covered in oil and then every time a play is whistled dead, they re-oil it.
9627 2018-05-28 01:59:06 Así es, para mi en el largo plazo el oil es Up arriba de los 100(pero es irse mucho tiempo para adelante) ademas se dio golden cross en el semanal
9628 2018-05-28 01:58:33 If you have oily skin like moi it’s super important to moisturize bc when you don’t moisturize enough your skin produces extra oil and you look super greasy
9629 2018-05-28 01:58:08 Yep it’s five gallons. Dry sump oil system.
9630 2018-05-28 01:58:07 firm believer in coconut oil
9631 2018-05-28 01:57:51 All the crude traders bringing oil back to reality while everyone is in the Hamptons 
9632 2018-05-28 01:57:40 Queen prob goes to bed at 5:30. Shouldn't be a problem.
9633 2018-05-28 01:57:08 Denman brush or the wet brush!!! And the best gel I’ve found is eco styler! Either the green or red top Black Jamaican castor oil is good to use too, strengthens and thickens your hair
9634 2018-05-28 01:57:02 i need to go get an oil change. just throw the whole car away.
9635 2018-05-28 01:56:55 Hmmmm maybe the vast natural gas and oil stores that the Russians couldn’t get to market due to sanctions? I’m just spit balling.
9636 2018-05-28 01:56:50 Wow! US Oil is putting on  a show in this pullback..  Opportunity for nice long entry in few weeks.
9637 2018-05-28 01:56:42 Spicy mayo is NOTHING compared to this garbage they’re trying to pull off. Just cause it has avocado oil in it, doesn’t make it a shoo in for sushi pairing lol
9638 2018-05-28 01:56:04 before you think gas stations are gonna roll back the prices tomorrow as #OIL plunged $6 over the weekend, think again kidz

those retailers are more parasitic than algos
9639 2018-05-28 01:55:52 so someone complimented me & said my skin looked dewy. little do they know, it’s just oil. i’m a greasy bitch
9640 2018-05-28 01:55:43 is like a ball of oil 
9641 2018-05-28 01:55:22 That's why priority #1 has to be diversification. AB is too prone to the whims of oil industry. OPEC screwed Alberta. Ontario used to be heavy industry but is now an economical powerhouse due to diversification. Ontario stalled in 2009, but then powered on like was no recession
9642 2018-05-28 01:55:14 Put that regular oil in a bottle and pray on it!! Problem solved 
9643 2018-05-28 01:55:04 well just last month 290,000 liters of oil spilled in northern Alberta

9645 2018-05-28 01:54:42 That's what oil and gas companies did in Alberta to try and avoid an NDP government. Actually told employees job losses were imminent if they voted NDP. Not one story on that??
9646 2018-05-28 01:54:42 He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. Deuteronomy 7:13
9647 2018-05-28 01:54:36 Yup, @jjhorgan $0.33+ per liter taxes. Please remember oil and gas are used for absolutely everything #bcpoli
9648 2018-05-28 01:54:33 The high yield of #palmoil means tt the area required is lower than any other competing crops. EU Commission report: if we replaced it w soybean oil, we wld need 200%+ more land... 1/2

9651 2018-05-28 01:54:04 I was a skim house growing up. We do 2% and use real butter for as much as we can in place of oil or sugar.
9652 2018-05-28 01:53:45 I’m so burned it’s unbelievable. I applied tanning oil but came home looking like a ripe cherry rather than a caramel apple :(
9653 2018-05-28 01:53:35 Has anyone written a review of FIRST REFORMED in light of David Buckel’s self immolation in protest of oil companies and how we’re not doing enough with regards to climate change?

9655 2018-05-28 01:53:14 Should be an easy one. Decriminalize on the federal level and give it back to the states.
Federalism at its finest.
9656 2018-05-28 01:53:10 Oil prices fell on Monday, extending a steep decline in the previous session, as the market eyed an increase in output from the world's three top crude producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia.

9659 2018-05-28 01:53:00 Russia is a petrol economy and the US is fracking and drilling everything.
Lower oil prices do more than any sanctions ever could.

9672 2018-05-28 01:50:49 Tofu is so fun. I really love it pan fried to get it crispy! Then after it is crispy I make a sauce of soy, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, honey, and red pepper flakes! Serve it with rice

9678 2018-05-28 01:49:33 Anyone with a retail account woulda been stopped out on #OIL so quickly.
9679 2018-05-28 01:49:32 We have one of the largest oil reserves. One of the only places we can ship to using current infrastructure is the US. The US bids extremely low for our oil because they can (we can't send it elsewhere). They get super cheap oil. The US then sells refined product (gas) back to us
9680 2018-05-28 01:49:21 Forget oil, we got a big housing bubble up here starting to pop as well

Oh, wait, that's right... you have never been to a oil and gas support rally.

9685 2018-05-28 01:49:07 We go through this every holiday and more so in winter, along with oil. I guess have to ask how much is enough. How much profit at the expense of ppl are they willing to make. Never ends. Two steps ahead and 4 back.

9690 2018-05-28 01:48:49 so all you provided me with was the fact of GDP increasing and the oil fields becoming stable again. while i thank you for the sources, i still gotta point out that none of that mentions any corporations/businesses coming back or not leaving the province

9697 2018-05-28 01:47:28 Fuel Price Update

The price of petrol was hiked by 15 paise today to Rs 86.08 a litre in Mumbai, while diesel was raised by 11 paise to Rs 73.64 a litre, according to data released by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
9698 2018-05-28 01:47:22 Fuel Price Update

Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise for the 15th straight day as state-run oil marketers increased rates in line with crude oil prices.
9699 2018-05-28 01:47:16 Franklin Graham is just one more evangelical snake oil salesmen using his distorted version of “Christianity” to wield power over thousands of gullible people.
9700 2018-05-28 01:47:12 I worked the oil and gas industry for 35 years. There has always been lows and highs. If u don’t believe that research it, dick.
9701 2018-05-28 01:47:03 Forgive Kenney, he doesn’t have a grasp on this oil industry yet!
9702 2018-05-28 01:47:02 $65 oil is still pretty high.
9703 2018-05-28 01:46:55 i don't think you understand how oil prices work...
9704 2018-05-28 01:46:45 No saturated fats, no carbs like rice or bread, and very limited sugar. And yep, cooking it yourself helps too. We can manage the type of oil used, and how much we fry  the food.
9705 2018-05-28 01:46:40 And in a slightly unrelated vein: avacado oil has one of the highest smoke points, so it's great for very high temp pan frying
9706 2018-05-28 01:46:33 And the colonel is mentioned *salutes Libya WAS the most prosperous country in Africa under his regime, the VAST majority of the population supported him BUT he refused to conform with the USA/Rothschild empire centred on oil, like Assad in Syria!
9707 2018-05-28 01:46:26 @TannerBriggs2
9708 2018-05-28 01:46:23 If the US is exporting oil for the first time in ages, and gas prices are rising, it’s gouging not Trumps policy.
9709 2018-05-28 01:46:04 I just burnt my midnight oil and gain nothing......
9710 2018-05-28 01:45:35 thus lowering our fuel costs but hey if you want to believe that exporting the oil helps lower our  price ........
9711 2018-05-28 01:45:29 Clearly you have a government job. Those of us in the oil sector or farmers or coal workers,  will make sure this aberration @RachelNotley does NOT happen again!

9715 2018-05-28 01:44:44 I do see his point that media (backed by oil/car industry $$$) sets the narrative, but he should have just stopped there.
9716 2018-05-28 01:44:41 While Brent crude is off highs @ $75.39 OMC’s still raise prices of Diesel and Petrol. Something is not right with the Math. And it’s time that the govt sacrifices some of its revenue that it earns in inflated taxes on Oil!
9717 2018-05-28 01:44:38 @KingJames You can add some essential oil to improve the smell. Tilt the head backward in order to prevent apple cider vinegar from getting into the eyes. Tilt the head back and rinse the hair once again. You can prepare the ACV in advance and keep it in a bottle in your bathroom
9718 2018-05-28 01:44:31 Great. For softening, coconut oil is as good!

9725 2018-05-28 01:43:47 Sure it’s been changing for 3 billion years, but never at the pace it’s changing now and strangely that pace closely matches human output of greenhouse gases which follow relatively simple physics to trap heat (just like a greenhouse...wow). You are falling for oil propaganda.
9726 2018-05-28 01:43:46 how is $cad not weaker on this oil crash. seriously

9734 2018-05-28 01:42:49 "On P C60 Have you tested shelf life once opened?"
I suppose it depends on humidity… If the container is not open too long, the shelf life is indefinite.
"And or oxidation process?"
I suggested the customer rub olive oil over the PC60 drop then cover with a plaster.
9735 2018-05-28 01:42:42 さてここで問題です。OILさんの理想の次ルはどんなものでしょ〜か！
9736 2018-05-28 01:42:36 They are no different than big oil
9737 2018-05-28 01:42:29 Of course they did. The job of TRUMP'S EPA is to rip up all science proving climate change, lie to the coal miners, destroy all protections for our air and water, be wholly owned by the oil companies.

We already know who Pruitt is. Getting rid of Pruitt & Trump is the problem.

9764 2018-05-28 01:39:20 President Trump has authorized construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and other methods of moving oil.He has also opened some federal land to drilling.  These prices are a result of Obama's suppression of the oil industry during his time in office.Another Obama dumb mistake.

9772 2018-05-28 01:38:41 £1.32 a litre for diesel now, i thought oil was supposed to come down?
9773 2018-05-28 01:38:32 Interesting analysis. Crude oil starts the weekend down more than 2% after last week's selloff.
9774 2018-05-28 01:38:28 the new world order still prevail. example  oil goes in a frenzy rally  and  suddenly  it drops down like hell. Destroying/stealing thousands  upon thousand $$$ of investment from the  people.

9787 2018-05-28 01:36:26 It's not necessarily manipulation -- the price of gold and platinum move together, as does electricity and oil. The correlation is due to underlying demand for the asset class splitting between buyers of one and buyers of the other, rather than manipulation of prices.
9788 2018-05-28 01:36:17 For that length olive oil wrap n set or Ebris wrap foam and carols daughter edge control.
9789 2018-05-28 01:36:13 Try olive oil. I plastered my belly with it while pregnant and didn’t get any stretch marks. 
9790 2018-05-28 01:36:08 Amazing how Blaney kept that car ablaze off the wall or away from other cars. Even with the oil under the tires perhaps
9791 2018-05-28 01:35:49 $ES_F S&P futures are +10. I wonder how much higher they would have been if oil wasn't dropping so hard.
9792 2018-05-28 01:35:37 Yup because her being humble about the money she earned makes her a liar, or the fact that she didn’t like mineral oil. I’m hollering.  anywho stay unbothered.
9793 2018-05-28 01:35:34 o carinho direcionado pra oil on canvas me deixa muito boba
9794 2018-05-28 01:35:32 oh utk rmbut, olive oil eh sesuai. ingtkan kelapa.
9795 2018-05-28 01:35:22 Crude oil is continuing its price meltdown
9796 2018-05-28 01:35:19 Maybe we need to do more off shore drilling and tap some of our vast reserves so we don’t depend on our enemies for oil
9797 2018-05-28 01:34:40 I’m slicker than a oil spill cooler than a freezer
9798 2018-05-28 01:34:28 I usually have no time for him, but in this case, not having effective outlets to port for Alberta, Saskatchewan and Northern BC oil is an issue that is severely limiting
9799 2018-05-28 01:34:08 Hot oil is not my friend.
9800 2018-05-28 01:33:59 And black seed oil research it if u don’t know about it 
9801 2018-05-28 01:33:55 Only a moron would short oil given the Iranian and Venezuelan uncertainty. When opec confirmed a poss pop in prod, there we go.
9802 2018-05-28 01:33:44  the ferocity of the downfall is great, I hope this continues like this to 50
9803 2018-05-28 01:33:40 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
9804 2018-05-28 01:33:32 You ought to pass a law so that oil revenue can be spent only on non-recurring expenses. Get your base revenue from the basics: sales tax, income tax, and corporate tax.

You probably already know this, but Louisiana has among the most broken budget processes in the U.S.

9807 2018-05-28 01:33:18 @JustinTrudeau It's time to speak out about our neighbors down South trying to shaft us in NAFTA, if they want to tariff our imports from them, tariff the hell out of the hydro and oil they import from us, or even better; cut them off completely and use the resources for Canada.
9808 2018-05-28 01:33:18 I have to say it is being a pain in my ass. I will step aside that breaks. Enough for me. Rode OIL from the 40s but will wait for confirmation. It keeps on slicing my pivots I don't like it...
9809 2018-05-28 01:33:10 But really my guess is the engine kicked a rod, splattered oil on the header pipes, and instant fire.
9810 2018-05-28 01:33:00 How do you explain the US exporting oil then?

9813 2018-05-28 01:32:53 @Chuckieboy I so agree with you. We will see Oil over $100 in 2019 $$$$
9814 2018-05-28 01:32:50 Did DW just say 5 gallons??? Of oil  #quarts
9815 2018-05-28 01:32:39 There's no reason for it!! Trumpass made a deal with Arabs n Putin to put our cash in their pockets! The world is awash in oil now!!! More $ in oil co pockets! Weren't  all the tax breaks enough?!
9816 2018-05-28 01:32:10 Trump doesn’t have an ideology...he has no real conviction...he is a conman/snake oil salesman he worships $$$$$...his greed is insatiable..he will always lie and will never apologize...hecannot be shamed...a
9817 2018-05-28 01:32:03 The price of electricity moves with the price of crude oil. Does that mean somehow electricity is inferior to crude oil? No one responded because this isn't an argument.
9818 2018-05-28 01:32:01 i saw someone with oily skin use the smashbox primer and just set regularly with powder and use blotting sheets to take off the oil throughout the day
9819 2018-05-28 01:32:00 Come rub some oil on my scalp
9820 2018-05-28 01:31:55 Hurricane season keeps coming earlier and earlier.....
9821 2018-05-28 01:31:55 It is my prediction, based on an understanding of economics.

R tax cut was STUPID !

Trump’s Trade Policies are STUPID !

Unilateral pulling out of Iran nuke deal was STUPID ! (with oil price implications).
9822 2018-05-28 01:31:28 Instead of asking me to select what these strange letters are to prove I’m not a robot. I think they should just ask what my favourite drink is? If I answer like oil or something then Im a robot.

9827 2018-05-28 01:31:03 You'd rather import oil that funds ISIS and other Islamic terrorists? What hypocrisy.
9828 2018-05-28 01:30:53 Canadians must get a fair price for our oil. How long will we sell below markets with no access to either coast.
9829 2018-05-28 01:30:45 Anyone that knows anything about world oil prices knows that the Iran deal is a total nonevent. The reality is that the the Saudis agreed to increase production by 2 MB and prices and oil stocks both dropped on Friday. The US is no longer dependent on Middle East oil.

9831 2018-05-28 01:30:13 What a funny propoganda. Hundreds & thousands of un armed Rohingya muslims murdered displaced by Burmese Bhudist army to capture Rohingya's land which has supposidly got huge oil/gas reserves.
9832 2018-05-28 01:30:05 3 eggs scrambled, 2 table spoons flax seed meal, one table spoon olive oil, cooked and eaten for dinner.
9833 2018-05-28 01:29:54 Get an Instant Pot, there are many good sites for Indian recipes using it. You may have to modify to avoid ghee (I use olive oil). We've been somewhat vegan lately, and it's much easier with home cooking.
9834 2018-05-28 01:29:53 Lifehack: Drive the world with an oil for a good password.
9835 2018-05-28 01:29:42 My oh my CBC is going at it full force.  Reporting oil stills report chiefs against pipe line.  All in top news on line.
9836 2018-05-28 01:29:41 Is there an essential oil for this

Jerry Brown has not been 100% good on the environment, but I'm quite certain our emission standards are top-notch and we tax gas a lot, which is good. And yes we have lots of oil in San Joaquin Valley, nat gas in Sacto Vally, oil on coast
9840 2018-05-28 01:29:10 Funny...as with the KM trans mountain pipeline oil spill today near Kamloops, nothing about this story was reported by the @CBCTheNational today!
9841 2018-05-28 01:29:09 And before you technical fuckheads say you predicted this OIL sell off, STFU. Your diverging bullshit gave off the signal 4 wks ago at 69.
9842 2018-05-28 01:28:47 @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC WHO is cleaning up this OIL SPILL? 
Better NOT b the taxpayers
9843 2018-05-28 01:28:26 Bang on...no Kevin Love is a huge loss for the Cavs...it's not even up for debate.
9844 2018-05-28 01:28:26 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9845 2018-05-28 01:28:25 If oil keeps falling at this rate, Indian economy will get the triple boost of rallying markets, fiscal stimulus, rate cuts. NDA's fortunes will look up and opposition unity will start to fray.
9846 2018-05-28 01:28:18 You clearly didn’t read that article: “Global oil markets are so intertwined...that changes in any one part of the system can trigger effects elsewhere.
..."if Iranian oil goes off the [world] market, it still affects the price in the United States,"

9848 2018-05-28 01:27:58 try tea tree oil
9849 2018-05-28 01:27:53 Agree. It's written by Lee Fang,who I don't find particularly credible. Just as easy to find an article about Hillary wanting very tough regs on fracking as we move to renewables & give up oil. Plus she was adamant about not drilling in the Arctic.
9850 2018-05-28 01:27:38 I used the heirlooms at work for a cucumber tomato salad with lemon herb vinaigrette in which I used rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, oregano, thyme, parsley, a dollop of Dijon, a smaller dollop of honey and olive/veg blend oil.
9851 2018-05-28 01:27:21 I've never seen oil fall this much on a Holiday weekend.

I'm not looking for a big fight here which I find unproductive on twitter, but please share the study you got...

9863 2018-05-28 01:25:40 Yea, I wasn't sure - but I just wanted you to check it out. Was it the CBD oil (drugs) - or can you not talk about it?
9864 2018-05-28 01:25:27 Put jb weld on my oil pan now let’s see if it holds
9865 2018-05-28 01:25:20 Maybe as a Pulitzer-winning urinalist you may want to interview the subject and find out what his Ho Fund Me account is all about (which started off as a cheeky joke anyway).
9866 2018-05-28 01:24:54 You should talk, rat, where's any of the prosperity of the last 30 yrs of flailing Tory fiscal policy..
 10 yrs behind on infrastructure projects that Tory gov'ts kept deferring while a record boom in oil went mostly out of prov, is finally being adressed by NDP, nice work.
9867 2018-05-28 01:24:31 Oil down 6%+. Crazy.
9868 2018-05-28 01:24:25 I suggest everyone take cbd oil before a fire with a lot of people you will be the happiest kitten.
9869 2018-05-28 01:24:20 Lead the way. So long as protesters are sitting in oil made kayaks.. hard to argue there is a viable alternative. Demand is up. #ohCanada
9870 2018-05-28 01:24:19 well uh..this is..uh..Gas on a dying flame? or is Oil a more suitable reference?

9881 2018-05-28 01:23:33 Always find it curious when teams are automatically given the "playing strong defence tag" when the opposition misses a ton of shots. Celtics are playing LeBron tight but the Cavs have had a plethora of open looks this evening.
9882 2018-05-28 01:23:11 It's pretty obvious what the tri-cabal want - more land & access to oil, only there's a few last vestiges of non conforming countries in their way. The deal is 'you get rid of our threat and you get their oil'
9883 2018-05-28 01:23:01 The Saudis will be more than happy to step up production, to kick Iran where it hurts. What is also missing from this equation is that we are an oil producer so you will get more rigs opening up as prices go up and stabilizes.
9884 2018-05-28 01:22:40 my room is clean & organized, diffusing coconut oil, changing color lights.... i’m at a high level of relaxation

9902 2018-05-28 01:19:32 I do agree, but we'll need to export oil to make the money needed to pay for it. You're throwing the baby out with the bath water.

9905 2018-05-28 01:18:57 @CNBC Why do you geniuses always neglect the ecological costs of hybrid and electric cars??? Do you think the battery raw materials magically appear? Do you think the electric cars’ batteries charge themselves magically? Mining, power generation using fossil fuels, etc.
9906 2018-05-28 01:18:49 Yeah but he's just one billionaire. How does his influence compare to the major oil companies, for example?
9907 2018-05-28 01:18:48 Such BS. We lead the country in economic growth. We such came out of a recession caused by a drop in global oil prices. We recovered quicker and better because of the NDP decision not to cut but spend, just as economists suggested.
9908 2018-05-28 01:18:42 Foreign vehicles like BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen (for the most part) are status symbols. Upkeep is ridiculously high. I dont wanna pay for a $100 plus oil change. Lets not mention actual repairs. I'll keep an American made or less expensive Asian made

9918 2018-05-28 01:17:35 Ashkanazi Jews have the highest IQ of any race, most surrounding regions are approx one standard deviation below average IQ I believe. The Saudis are doing ok because they have oil wealth and employ foreign assistance.

9930 2018-05-28 01:16:17 While backtesting this caught my attention. On may 16 there was an alert for XOM, where 10,200 August $90 calls were bought from 0.45-0.50. Pete bought these calls. The oil plunge made this cheaper selling for half the price now. Good opportunity?  @petenajarian @investitute

9937 2018-05-28 01:15:06 The hairstylist I went to gave me a sample of this oil to use when I air dry my hair and it smells like gummy bears so now I have to buy a whole bottle when I go back.

9951 2018-05-28 01:12:15 @jefecharleston Have you ever taken CBD Enriched Hemp OIl?  It is a neuroprotectant that helps lessen the issues/damage with CTE from repetitive head trauma.
9952 2018-05-28 01:12:14 Beautiful. If I had Starbucks stock I would be raising holy hell.
9953 2018-05-28 01:12:07 If you’ve forgotten, like I had, what a powerhouse the Oils were in their heyday of the 80s, Midnight Oil: 1984 will remind you. Oh and Peter Garrett’s Frankenstein/whirling dervish dancing is something to behold in a sweaty pub barn. #midnightoil1984 #midnightoil #scriptcentral
9954 2018-05-28 01:12:06 Respiratory vs liver absorption is a world of difference. For pain, I find that edibles (liver absorption) provides decent pain relief. Respiratory absorption (vaping CBD oil) is okay for anxiety, but not super helpful for pain (for me). 

Oral administration of oil best for pain
9955 2018-05-28 01:12:03 Oil performing like JR Smith right now
9956 2018-05-28 01:11:56 When gas hit $5 a gallon it was due to speculators creating an oil panic ,Obama made what they did illegal & Trump repealed it. Good try. Great lie. Deflect some more instead of accept the facts.
9957 2018-05-28 01:11:56 I’m still trying to find products that work, for this one I used Ors curls unleashed Shea butter and honey curl defining creme with a dime of olive oil eco styler gel (the green one lol) and the as I am leave in of course
9958 2018-05-28 01:11:54 Just as current petroleum minister (@Buhari) signed $25bn unspecified NNPC contract and fraudulent oil subsidy which Governors are doubting. Can minister of petroleum.eum respond to this?
9959 2018-05-28 01:11:47 Look at per capita consumption of soybean oil in the U.S. versus Italy.
9960 2018-05-28 01:11:37 Not sure? Currently Don’t Have Any Of The product Left!?

9962 2018-05-28 01:11:30 I was wrong to say Crude Oil is getting beaten with two ugly sticks.  A baseball bat with a Mark McGwire Homerun shot from the steroid era is more like it. $CL $WTI

9974 2018-05-28 01:09:20 Finally got my oil changed after about 20,000 miles ..... oops
9975 2018-05-28 01:09:13 No I don’t think Trump is the problem, I KNOW Trump is the problem. The snake oil salesman matured to a Treason weasel.
9976 2018-05-28 01:08:58 Another thing the Canadian Government should do to help the killer whales and Salmon, is to put a stop to the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain pipeline. The pipeline would increase oil tanker traffic in the BC coast and increase the risk of an oil spill
9977 2018-05-28 01:08:44 The “fools” have been supplying oil to BC for the last 60 years without major accident to keep BC gasline price from skyrocketting.
9978 2018-05-28 01:08:43 PSA: Oil is primarily a speculative asset, secondarily a commodity. $CL_F
9979 2018-05-28 01:08:19 Big oil helps to keep our economy going and it will continue to do so until we can, and we will, come up with renewable sources of energy that don’t rely on fossil fuels to produce or destroy other aspects of our environment, for example wind turbines.
9980 2018-05-28 01:08:13 Can't drink oil. Can't eat money. Can't make the rich understand.
9981 2018-05-28 01:07:52 Just put oil for in the l section, we're going to lose them anyway.
9982 2018-05-28 01:07:50 I'll write one soon enough, although admittedly there's a lot of Haskell folks who have really bought into the snake oil business.
9983 2018-05-28 01:07:45 Explain it to extremely anti-oil NDP Avi Lewis.  He was just on @CTVNews @Evansolomon program, insisting oil demand is going DOWN.  Avi is the creator of the rabid LEAP manifest, the new NDP bible.  Such a thinker would of course tell you anything to hope to deceive people
9984 2018-05-28 01:07:38 And we’ve just witnessed the non-sensical ways Liberals make equivalencies and can’t figure out why their arguments are failures...

9987 2018-05-28 01:07:05 He can't send you olive oil so it would have to be ceramics for you - What would you like, a bowl ?
9988 2018-05-28 01:06:55 We import most of our oil and can't export our oil because of rogue provincial leaders. Also don't forget about the new provincial and federal carbon tax
9989 2018-05-28 01:06:46 No but can I pay you to come lie on my floor and scream?
9990 2018-05-28 01:06:42 They are NOT Christian. They are charlatans. Snake oil peddlers. Carny barkers. Cons. I refuse to go see jizzy Joel “preach”. He will take the money of the needy & the poor but will leave your ass out in the cold after Hurricane Harvey as he sits in his mansion. Joel

9996 2018-05-28 01:05:41 The gauges aren't to be used on American soil. If Errol's symbolic piercing didn't work you need to relax and give him the full one gauge back. The oil helps us. I'm not upset about it. I'm for cpd.
9997 2018-05-28 01:05:33 Not surprising though. Oil and oil field services to give back if supply not constrained.

9999 2018-05-28 01:05:15 I was never on a sub but I ballasted and deballasted many fuel tanks on a ship to transfer fuel oil or to pump fuel out using sir pressure and sea water ,, so I'm sure they use similar system to dive and to surface ...what does that have to do with flat Earth?

10001 2018-05-28 01:05:06 Ron, you understand the crude oil market as well as you understand Chinese math. Unless you were trying to be funny! You were!
10002 2018-05-28 01:05:05 Dems will be wrong again! Late last week, Crude oil prices dropped ~ $3.00 / barrel.  Others have increased production.  Gas prices will once again begin to decline.  Dems will again look like fools.
10003 2018-05-28 01:04:51 He's not for blocking oil To BC... he's for blocking oil Through BC. Have someone explain it to you
10004 2018-05-28 01:04:50 Cool cool. Any opinions on the snake oil character?
10005 2018-05-28 01:04:38 Any mechanics that could help us with the following??
oil leak, brake lines, ball joints, wheel bearings, coolant needed to be flushed
10006 2018-05-28 01:04:31 big oil will not give up until the last drop is gone.
10007 2018-05-28 01:04:28 Great. ..and coal and horse drawn buggies and whale oil lamps. 
What a fool trump is.   
He will be short lived, thankfully!

10009 2018-05-28 01:03:51 @PressSec In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would be a nuclear threat and should dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia. Today USA, Europe, Israel… close their eyes to the great danger that is Maduro-RedKorea-Iran-narco whith the biggest oil world reserve
10010 2018-05-28 01:03:27 Jimmy - everyone knows the oil pattern on the lanes that night weren’t regulation. Let’s get on a course here soon
10011 2018-05-28 01:03:20 Lmfaooooo come on, olive oil. It’s just us bros hanging about.
10012 2018-05-28 01:02:54 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you have to do something about the price of gas.  When I hear my friends talk lately it's about how expensive gas is.  The Dems are saying it's all because we pulled out of the Iran deal.  So much oil in our country, how can the price be going up?
