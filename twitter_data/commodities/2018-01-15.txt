41 2018-01-15 21:31:33 Ironic: the only business industry @realDonaldTrump was ever able to succeed in is real estate. One of the only commodities that gets it value from just existing and being finite. Just dont physically destroy it, and it has value. And now he has the ability to start nuclear war.
42 2018-01-15 21:23:20 Don't know whether to laugh or cry when a president starts talking about mining a mineral at a time when the world has moved on to an alternative a million times more sustainable, cheaper, and especially at a time when physical commodities are losing ground to virtual commodities
43 2018-01-15 21:12:47 It has everything to do with currency.

67 2018-01-15 19:12:45 It is the industrial expansion next cycle that will increase demand for commodities and push up commodity prices, not the other way around. Several years into the next recovery cycle there will be a huge commodity shortage story which will send prices through the roof.
68 2018-01-15 19:10:39 "It is sometimes asked whether the law of value exists and operates in our country, under the socialist system.

Yes, it does exist and does operate. Wherever commodities and commodity production exist, there the law of value must also exist."

69 2018-01-15 19:09:14 A huge part of our justice system is now corrupted by its conflicts of interest: judges, lawyers, law enforcement, forensic analysis, the bail system, jails, prisons, support industries--all profit from "business": aka human commodities to process & cage. It's pure evil.

76 2018-01-15 18:41:52 The underlying economic forces are the same. A wages system, goods and services take the form of commodities for sale. Trading on the world capitalist market plus a ruling class. If you can't afford to pay for the things you need you don't get them. That's capitalism.

79 2018-01-15 18:34:02 But migrant workers aren't inanimate commodities to be traded across int'l borders.

90 2018-01-15 17:42:55 The chart makes it easy to see which assets are relatively riskier over the long run: commodities stand out from an underperforming perspective, EM from a volatility perspective. Looking for the same color on the top half can show you consistently well-performing asset classes.
91 2018-01-15 17:42:39 commodities, cash and bonds have all under-performed, but 2008-2018 is a poor window to draw conclusions from, as it's characterized by recovery from the financial disaster of 2007.

94 2018-01-15 17:25:59 Sir, the taxation system has become lucid absolutely.. But it has definitely led to hike in product prices espicially the electronic and retail commodities.Take an example of Textile market of moradabad itself...badly affected by GST effect.
95 2018-01-15 17:22:02 One of the most overlooked advantage Bitcoin and other cryptos have over stocks and commodities: The market is open 24 hours a day 365 days a year...there are no holidays. Can't trade stocks today = can't make money.
96 2018-01-15 17:19:22 Uma coisa não exclui a outra. Se fosse assim ninguém investia em ouro/commodities. O que dizer do Google? Apreciação de capital é uma estratégia...
