5 2018-08-20 23:58:31 Actually you can! My brother is super allergic to peanuts, but they use American pressed peanut oil, which doesn't have any allergens once it's heated. When we order, we just ask them not to switch the oil until after our order is done just in case.

68 2018-08-20 23:51:50 Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. In the 60's, they were the richest nation in Latin America.

75 2018-08-20 23:51:04 Yea, sure. That's why he put the dead kids in an oil drum instead of calling the police. Don't think so.
76 2018-08-20 23:50:44 I didn’t know hairspray kept glitter in your hair so I put glue in it. Now my hair is marinating in olive oil. I’m human pasta.

78 2018-08-20 23:50:27 Then why didn’t he call the police immediately to report what the wife “had done”? Also, why did he abuse their corpse by placing them in oil tanks? That has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese!

87 2018-08-20 23:49:15 Does anyone believes this story. You would think if you see your wife strangling your kids you would call 911 in hopes they would save them. Not dump their bodies in an oil well. #deathpenalty

99 2018-08-20 23:46:50 Not true.  Solar, wind and water could power the world right now. Agreed, not as efficient (right now), but I'd rather limit CO2 emissions. Finally, you mine semiconductors for solar, and oil for oil, the difference is you burn the oil after...  "green"er, yes?
100 2018-08-20 23:46:30 of many many factors in the crisis of Venezuela. Oil prices tanking by saudi arabia selling their oil at a much cheaper price, Venezuela not having diversified their maj export.

108 2018-08-20 23:45:49 Stupid comparison. You know that a country with minimal resources--or just one resource--is ripe for being screwed by other countries or screwing itself. Each is true in Venezuela, and its problems have to do with serious mismanagement and oil.

122 2018-08-20 23:44:08 And Republicans say... NOTHING. The @gop has been bought and sold by the oil industry for years, and now Russia. No Way! No way in the world. They will be held accountable. And our government purged.
123 2018-08-20 23:44:04 Why am I not seeing more concern for the safety of residents in #Louisiana this #hurricaneseason ? Their hurricane response funds came from taxes on the oil from the Gulf.

144 2018-08-20 23:41:03 100% of chimneys in London were cleaned by small children on the 1800s. We also nearly hunted whales to extinction for lamp oil. The world has moved on.
145 2018-08-20 23:41:00 He was so enraged that his wife strangled his daughters but he buried her & placed the children in oil tanks? That sounds made up.
146 2018-08-20 23:40:59 Snake oil salesman just can't stop slinging the snake oil.
147 2018-08-20 23:40:52 That could get a tad embarassing when they need to come and ask for more water... & more energy... or oil... or...
148 2018-08-20 23:40:50 we actually don’t know and they weren’t as hot to eat after cooking them down in oil but i was dying cleaning them out

150 2018-08-20 23:40:42 I just made French fries with air and no oil I love science
151 2018-08-20 23:40:28 If you sit around a lot that can also increase inflammation in the  body a lot. If you're looking for supplements to try I recommend cissus,  collagen type 1 and 3, bromelain, fish oil and turmeric. Those I think  are really useful for decreasing inflammation and soreness.

158 2018-08-20 23:39:49 Let him know that even if nothing was done ,  with oil price up, recession will end, temporarily.
159 2018-08-20 23:39:47 Just glancing at the Watts case in Frederick, CO, I was having memories of the Coleman case.  Christopher Coleman would follow me around in the evenings. Minerals & Oil were the background of many individuals involved through the years.  Apache, Anadarko, Enron, Forrest Oil, etc.
160 2018-08-20 23:39:45 The nationalization of oil is one of the reasons why the country is a shithole

163 2018-08-20 23:39:08 @narendramodi Venezuela is in Great economic turmoil. Why can't India buy it's oil from Venezuela at better deal??. Win Win for both nation.
164 2018-08-20 23:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
165 2018-08-20 23:38:58 He is very slick..but not slick enough. He thinks he is superior and he thinks he can keep it together and fool everyone, but he is such a pathetic piece of shit he gave investigators many clues. Throw him in the oil tank and fill er' up!
166 2018-08-20 23:38:50 ahahahahahahaha with the oil spill to match
167 2018-08-20 23:38:50 If anyone died in my home, especially if it were my children, I will tell you what I wouldn’t do... 

I wouldn’t drive to rural CO and dump their bodies in an oil well, then beg for their return on TV.  

I would probably call 911. 

That’s just me.
168 2018-08-20 23:38:45 This is why he asked investigators to check for dna under the childrens fingernails (after submerging the poor kids in a barrel of oil) knowing full well they wouldn't be able to. Seems like premeditation to me.
169 2018-08-20 23:38:43 In other words one of Trump's buddies is in the oil business and Trump wants to make him more money. 

Money is worthless if we can't breathe clean air.

Trump is Satan.

172 2018-08-20 23:38:08 If I'm gonna buy toxic bullshit, I'd rather buy it from a self-made strong snake oil salesman who doesn't need corporate wellfare or a job at Fox to succeed and be famous. Alex Jones will forever be a better evil bastard than this pathetic failed lawyer.
173 2018-08-20 23:38:03 You could label it Hourse Oil and day no horses were harmed in the making of it

181 2018-08-20 23:36:35 So why did he dunk their bodies in oil? Death penalty no trial! He deserves nothing short of death.
182 2018-08-20 23:36:21 I still strongly believe that global warming is real.
Even if it isn’t, we still need to make efforts to reduce our carbon emissions. Besides, we’re already running out of oil.

184 2018-08-20 23:36:16 Also holy balls old gear oil smells terrible.
185 2018-08-20 23:36:08 Snail oil???
186 2018-08-20 23:36:07 Also, I have seen a lot of Great movies and TV Shows that are located in BC,  I don't know if they can continue without Beautiful scenery....  That industry will be a bad hit to Canadian Economy, Maybe more then Oil brings in.
187 2018-08-20 23:36:03 Man, a Miller knock off...something...visceral, maybe done in oil pastels or like Meltdown from '88..something that made you feel gritty.
THAT would have been the best there could be at what he does.
188 2018-08-20 23:35:59 You a good mom when you pay for his oil change, gas up his car & wash it

Spark plugs next!!
192 2018-08-20 23:35:39 WHY IS FAKE TRUMP REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA & TRUMP MORE THAN THE INTERESTS OF THE USA / TRUMP WANTS THE $30 BILLION FEE THAT RUSSIA WILL GIVE TO TRUMP FOR ALLOWING RUSSIA TO GIVE EXXON THE $500 BILLION RUSSIAN OIL DEAL--COLLUSION & CRIMINAL-LOCK TRUMP UP ?
193 2018-08-20 23:35:17 Wow! Def possible! Maybe she (or he -it is an oil site) was jealous 
194 2018-08-20 23:35:09 Hoping so Jimbo. Don’t want him turning up next week in a cushy Chairman or Executive role in one of the Big 4 Banks or in an Oil & Energy company...

That would be an absolute slap in our collective faces.

198 2018-08-20 23:34:41 Truth. Displaced for oil. Displaced for timber. Displaced for every conceivable natural resource. Ultimately, Indigenous peoples are getting displaced for what the Nazis called “lebensraum” a.k.a. the Indigenous Genocide.
199 2018-08-20 23:34:36 You sell snake oil you're a conman!
200 2018-08-20 23:34:31 Chris Watts Arrest Affidavit (part 3):  A bed sheet found in the field near where Shannan Watts was buried and the girls bodies were put in oil tanks--matched the pattern of sheets found in the trash at at Watt's home.
201 2018-08-20 23:34:30 It's sad so many people are being duped into buying common coconut oil, when the positive research is about high-MCT oils. Most coconut oils are not high in MCTs.

206 2018-08-20 23:33:35 I started using Haba's Squalane beauty oil at night this year and I am impressed with the results! I have combination skin and some products couldn't penetrate certain parts of my face, but this oil - it's the last step of my routine - helped to lock in the rest of the stuff
207 2018-08-20 23:33:22 Chris Watts Arrest Affidavit: (part 2)  Watts said he and his wife Shannan were discussing separation.   Watts admitted loading the bodies of his wife and children into his work truck and taking them to an oil work site.
208 2018-08-20 23:33:21 ...oil and water.
209 2018-08-20 23:33:10 This all started with the previous president Mr. Chavez when he kicked out all of the oil companies and privatized the industry. Good riddance.
210 2018-08-20 23:33:04 Cyr et al: High extra-pair paternity rates in longspurs around oil/gas development. Really preliminary results, but no extra-pair young yet in undeveloped prairies! Extra cool stuff #BOUatIOC #IOCongress2018

212 2018-08-20 23:32:56 Peanut pasta:
Combine 1/2 c peanut butter, 1/2c soy sauce.COVER microwave on high 2 min. Add 1/3 water and mix well (just keep mixing it’ll work out) add red pepper, sesame oil, pepper to taste. Pour over 1lb cooked pasta with your fav veggies and protein. Good leftover cold.

217 2018-08-20 23:32:11 It’s so fucking amazing to watch my dog sleep through a thunderstorm that used to put him in shakes and fits    but meh, unfortunately finally totally out of thc free CBD oil 
218 2018-08-20 23:32:06 ...why don't you come here...our pakhtuns r ready...bring lots of oil...
219 2018-08-20 23:31:53 Hey Michael.. can sympathize with chronic pain ~ though for different reasons. I do use the oil occassionally with other meds and treatments but can say that yes... I feel the benefits are  worthwhile. All the best.
220 2018-08-20 23:31:51 Don't ask me to chill bc I gotta go home and put coconut oil in my hair srry
221 2018-08-20 23:31:35 a customer told me not to sass her.... bitch u explain to me what a cold pressed oil is... i’ll fuckin WAIT...
222 2018-08-20 23:31:24 I'll stick with Olive Oil, which has served us well for generations. I don't need Canola oil, sugar or processed foods in boxes.  If you work for them, it's your business.

224 2018-08-20 23:31:03 How much for the snake oil?
225 2018-08-20 23:30:56 Depending on the country. Norway is 20% of GDP and they have a sovereign wealth fund and savvy enough are diversifying from Oil When it runs out... Oil&Gas contribute with almost a Trillion to the US economy and is a major employer so yes once is gone is going to be a challenge
226 2018-08-20 23:30:52 Beard oil definitely, gives it a nice shine
227 2018-08-20 23:30:42 Honestly switching from coffee to tea made the world of a difference for my anxiety and cbd oil. It has no thc so it doesn’t make you high 
228 2018-08-20 23:30:42 @LIBREinitiative In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would be a nuclear threat and should dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia. Today USA, Europe, Israel… close their eyes to the great danger that is Maduro-RedKorea-Iran-narco whith the biggest oil world reserve
229 2018-08-20 23:30:32 beard oil or no beard oil? I condition it daily and brush it with a soft brush. i will use shampoo like once a week.

234 2018-08-20 23:29:35 It says full spectrum CBD Hemp Oil.  We use specially cultivated Hemp that produces 26% CBD and only .2% THC. We aren't using CBD isolate

236 2018-08-20 23:29:09 Wow.

A simple google search for "us sanctions on Venezuela" or "us sanctions on Venezuela oil" returns all you need to know.

Triggered much Chuck?
237 2018-08-20 23:29:05 Why don't you tell your Arab brothers to drop the oil prices, to lighten the financial burden on gareeb people in this disaster? You RedGreen types like to bash Modi first, and are now crying to him. You only like to play politics in the middle of a disaster.
238 2018-08-20 23:29:05 Let's just invade them and steal all their oil and gas.
239 2018-08-20 23:28:50 And they miraculously ended up in oil barrels at his work.
240 2018-08-20 23:28:49 That's going to look great with the oil rigs and pipelines and exploration that'll happen.
241 2018-08-20 23:28:44 I put coconut oil all over ma body and now I’m slippin out of my bed
242 2018-08-20 23:28:42 I was more going for humour, but am pleased that it isn’t. A few is fine, I’ve even tried a recipe that uses mayonnaise in cake once (it is, after all, just eggs and oil), but a whole book would be bizarre.
“Lol” at the book on your bottom shelf.
243 2018-08-20 23:28:37 Exactly man. Being rich(investing in banks) and helpful to others brings a lot of benefit.

246 2018-08-20 23:28:25 Plugged in here at Lucas Oil Stadium. We should get more of a look at Andrew Luck tonight, as he's expected to play into the second quarter.
247 2018-08-20 23:28:24 Ohhh please!! I already coughed up the money for an oil change, but next time
248 2018-08-20 23:28:04 Hydraulic fracturing is NOT a "gas and oil drilling method"

Your tweet is evidence of brain poisoning from the movie Gasland.
249 2018-08-20 23:28:03 I think the worst thing I've ever done while driving is dab the oil off my pizza w a napkin like a little b*tch
250 2018-08-20 23:28:02 Venezuela. The oil rich country that went down because of the lies of socialism.
251 2018-08-20 23:27:59 Ordered a salad for dinner because I wanted to be healthy but then I proceeded to down 4 rolls drenched in Italian oil. Lovely
252 2018-08-20 23:27:09 Ooooh good first steps are getting an oil cleanser (Neutrogena has a cheap one at target!), a foaming cleanser, then a moisturizer. And build up from there.
253 2018-08-20 23:27:05 I had stop sipping oil baby 
I was big moe the bar baby

254 2018-08-20 23:27:01 Just learned how to perform a oil change lol
255 2018-08-20 23:26:49 There is absolutely some science that is biased.  Cigarette companies paid for science that proved nicotine wasn’t addictive, oil companies pay for science that shows global warming doesn’t exist / isn’t caused by CO2, big pharma studies, etc...

257 2018-08-20 23:26:19 I did an olive oil treatment on my hair even though there are mixed reviews and oh man, so sleek and shiny and my head doesn’t look like god is punishing me for the world’s sin with broken flyaways
258 2018-08-20 23:26:18 It amazes me how people use Norway as an example of the success of socialism. I wish someone would mention the finances of the country. They have gone through most of their oil money, 3/4 of a TRILLION dollars. There are about 5 million citizens, it's not going to last,
259 2018-08-20 23:26:10 You need more water.

1 cup of rice, drop of olive oil, 2 cups of water. Let it boil then cover it with low heat for 20 min.
260 2018-08-20 23:26:06 Recipe for a good time: tortilla wraps, eggs, bacon & mozzarella. Scrambled up in a coconut oil frying pan. Serve as a budget breakfast burrito.
261 2018-08-20 23:26:04 Worrying it is Corbyn's plan for the UK. Venezuela with 2nd biggest oil reserves in World and they are eating their zoo animals.

263 2018-08-20 23:25:42 How can we handle so many Oromo when we don’t have proper border patrol and we don’t have national database of our citizens Oromo could claim to be Somalis and demand our oil and our resources @alihwarsame @SomaliPM #puntland #somaliland #somalia #Mogadishu #Kickthemout
264 2018-08-20 23:25:15 Snake oil? 
265 2018-08-20 23:25:14 Are more people killed and injured by automobiles or oil?
266 2018-08-20 23:25:09 Is it to cook white beans and oil??? Then take it with bread??
267 2018-08-20 23:25:03 I tak pakai cleansing oil, just makeup wipes je. Tp lepas guna mesti kulit rasa kasar and tak lama lepas tu, naik jerawat. Ever since that tak guna simple dah.
268 2018-08-20 23:24:39 Private operator Camino Oil & Gas says tariffs  drove company's steel costs up 10% to 15% overnight before measures were even implemented. "There's more money going into your frack than tubulars, but it was immediate." #enercom #togc2018 #tariffs
269 2018-08-20 23:24:36 Barely needs any. Ran on batteries. No oil changes n shit like that with a gas engine
270 2018-08-20 23:24:30 I am astounded by what people put in their toilets, contact lenses, Dental floss, Cooking oil, sanitary pads. Who does that? 

Is there any wonder we have so much pollution out there?
271 2018-08-20 23:24:27 you are also a snake oil salesman....a very arrogant, condescending snake oil salesman
272 2018-08-20 23:24:13 You can neutralize chili oil on your skin with rubbing alcohol and dish soap. Today I learned the hard way not to pee right after slicing Fresno peppers.
273 2018-08-20 23:24:12 The discovery of massive deposits of cheap concentrated portable energy as fossil fuels (esp oil) was of profound importance in shaping modernity. Also the shields u mention may be somewhat substantial since good nutrition has permanent repercussions for cognition and personality
274 2018-08-20 23:24:10 Like diamond bank gives my dad cow yearly,n during Ramadan banks compete to bring rice n beverages
275 2018-08-20 23:24:07 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
276 2018-08-20 23:23:58 I want an oil diffuser so bad!
277 2018-08-20 23:23:56 That's the point, D. If someone can sell you 2 sun's then you might as well be sold snake oil. Never heard that one before?
278 2018-08-20 23:23:54 so good. All u need is olive oil and pink salt
279 2018-08-20 23:23:53 I buy chips and chicken from west hills mall today erh ...hmmmm den ebi like i dey drink oil !
280 2018-08-20 23:23:47 Keep in mind... On Tuesday, Watts told @ZoraStephenson on camera he simply wanted his family to come home. According to the affidavit, by that point he had already loaded all three of their bodies into his work truck, and driven them to a remote oil site in Weld County.
281 2018-08-20 23:23:33 CBD oil on her food
282 2018-08-20 23:23:16 My whole apartment reaks of garlic olive oil and I’m all about it
283 2018-08-20 23:23:14 So he is claiming his wife killed their babies......Is that why he dumped those same babies in an oil tank? She killed them my ass.
284 2018-08-20 23:23:04 How long does an oil change one might ask? Apparently 1 hour and counting 
285 2018-08-20 23:22:31 Last last @PoliceNG will make heaven faster than @IkejaElectric
286 2018-08-20 23:22:26  that stuff reminds me of the pungent odour that went through the ship every time they pour eucalyptus oil into the ventilation filters. Still makes me feel like 
287 2018-08-20 23:22:16 The oil companies sell oil.  It’s our fault for consuming it. It’s the government’s fault for not organising alternatives.
288 2018-08-20 23:22:16 I continually receive mailers from dealers and other service centers offering oil changes, etc. and all I can do is laugh as I toss them into the recycle bin.
289 2018-08-20 23:22:10 Coconut oil & tumeric!! It’s amazing !!! Apply w a toothbrush and brush for 3-5 mins then brush normally. It’s kinda gross and has a weird texture, but is sooooo worth it !
290 2018-08-20 23:22:03 My grandma used the CBD cream with emu oil today for the first time and she said it worked!!!!! #pointforthewin #cbdheals #relief
291 2018-08-20 23:22:02 I just put peppermint oil on my temples & feel like i can see through space & time
292 2018-08-20 23:21:58 Oh. Did you even notice that oil prices went down up to 60% after that? I know you all don’t care much about what is happening outside your country…
293 2018-08-20 23:21:54 No more Palm oil products for this guy.
294 2018-08-20 23:21:49 fish oil for dinner let's get it boys
295 2018-08-20 23:21:45 @lickitoff so picture it. You bouta have sex and the nigga pull out the oil spray bottle like it’s a porn ..... what do you do?
296 2018-08-20 23:21:37 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the in the cafeteria with the wrench!
297 2018-08-20 23:21:19 Coconut oil works well as makeup remover?? Is there anything that stuff can’t do it’s amazing what a game changer
298 2018-08-20 23:21:16 When will people learn that Saudi Arabia are terrorist in their own right and the West sucks up to them for what  - oil
299 2018-08-20 23:21:14 Venezuela isn't a socialist country. They are autocracy with a few wealthy oligarchs running the country as well as wealthy oil tycoons that run bug businesses and a large class of impoverished people. They are actually more like the U.S. than a Socialist country.
300 2018-08-20 23:21:10 Do we have to get tested for the APOE4 gene before using any of your recipes that include coconut oil & MCT? Your books never mentioned APOE4 concerns :-(

302 2018-08-20 23:21:08 took a few small hits off my dab pen. decided i wanted more. went to load the oil... and my stoned ass loaded it into my spare battery instead of on the coil
303 2018-08-20 23:21:07 Oil $PBT $VNOM
304 2018-08-20 23:21:04 brother had to evacuate in California the fire was 1/2 mile from his house remember when Fort McMurray burned tree huggers jumped for joy cause its an oil town truth was a politician in Calgary gutted the fire fund i remember that year fire so bad the smoke made it to Winnipeg
305 2018-08-20 23:21:03 There's a very simple solution: tRump likes to raise tariff's so much, just raise the tariff's and federal excise taxes on gasoline.  Or, simply threaten to invade an oil-producing country and thus whip up the oil markets.  Keep the efficiency AND the profits.  Win-win, right?
306 2018-08-20 23:20:39 Cleanse, tone, moisturise twice a day (add a serum at night). Exfoliate 1-2 times a week. Clay mask once a week. That’s it. You don’t need expensive brands, just something free from nasties. I use Essano Rosehip Oil range.
307 2018-08-20 23:20:20 The party is not what we make them.

By the time of the general it is too late to have an effect.

During the primary, the DCCC and superdelegates decide in all but unusual cases.

Both parties are funded by the same donors. Both are pro war, pro Wall St., pro bank, pro oil...
308 2018-08-20 23:20:18 Trying to cover up @Labour Lies Jeremy? 
Trying to convince Scots that you and your brethren aren’t English Snake Oil Salesmen? 
Trying to tell us Labour Pacts with Tories is actually ok?

What are you trying to tell us Jeremy, stay with England because you need to rob us more?
309 2018-08-20 23:20:04 I know! I always thought Carrie should’ve went with Aiden & I loved MBFGW when I was like 11 when he gets baptized in the oil 
310 2018-08-20 23:20:01 Norway has a massive sovereign wealth fund due to their massive oil plays,  that is the only way they can make it with the social programs they have.  Plus they pay nothing for defense, since the U.S pays lions share of NATO costs.
311 2018-08-20 23:19:44 I don’t use vitamins but argon oil is my fav sis
312 2018-08-20 23:19:42 Steam (microwave) broccoli and make pasta. In a frying pan, heat some olive oil, garlic, chili pepper flakes, and anchovies. Add to pasta + broccoli.

(I was afraid of anchovies as a kid, but they're actually quite good. You only need a few and they dissolve into nothingness).
313 2018-08-20 23:19:36 Im gunna have to invest in these oil pens. Soon i start working and im gunna have to smoke on the go
314 2018-08-20 23:19:33 dawn be like “take me back to the oil spill”
315 2018-08-20 23:19:28 I think the rise in inequality had more to do with 40 years as an oil supplier. Raw materials suppliers Russia/USA tend to be less equal than countries that add value Japan/Germany. The FIRRE, Finance Insurance Retail Real Estate, economy booms. Bedtime.
316 2018-08-20 23:19:24 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
317 2018-08-20 23:19:19 It means I can afford to get to work like so many others and afford groceries at the same time. This is no joke. When gas prices were so high, over $4/gallon I was skipping meals. This is just answering to his oil cronies so they can drain resources and destroy the earth faster.
318 2018-08-20 23:19:00 I just saw this and I agree. I like lots of the ordinary products but I don’t think the “dupes” argument holds up sometimes? Like I don’t think that the Marula oil is as good as DE’s at all
319 2018-08-20 23:18:55 thanks for that v useful thinking - I'm not so keen on heavy musk undertones, which is why i very rarely buy 'popular' kinds of perfume. The ingredients list was from an aromatherapist who made an oil for me. I may just go back to her & ask for more..
320 2018-08-20 23:18:44  coconut oil reverses dental cavities  you're welcome

#CoconutOilPulling #DentalHealth
321 2018-08-20 23:18:35 Your Down payment can reduce that! Also think about it, without anything under the hood, that cuts down on most maintenance. Also no oil changes
322 2018-08-20 23:17:58 If your environment has collapsed, every effort you undertake to support your own health will collapse too. So how about we put fracking, new pipelines  for dirty oil, the deleterious Site C dam and harmful environmental practises to bed now. Speak up BC. You're on fire.
323 2018-08-20 23:17:29 This are the kind of youth you ask to govern us right smh ,he can’t even defend his stand ..black man dey make charcoal ,cement,shoes and cloths for Aba,oil bunkering for niger delta etc
324 2018-08-20 23:17:26 Not oil per se, but money  > principles
325 2018-08-20 23:16:59 Be the oil change you want to see in the world
326 2018-08-20 23:16:54 Not sure if you can get it over in your neck of the woods but taking CBD Oil can really improve or make it feel like you don’t have any issues at all.
327 2018-08-20 23:16:32 I would have married 1997 Mariah Carey and learned to deal with her crazy.....
328 2018-08-20 23:16:19 If Trump was any kind of crazy ass King George, he'd bring back Whale Oil and attack Japan for pirating our catch near the Antarctic.

Don't anyone tell him. You know he would.
329 2018-08-20 23:16:08 She taps her chin in thought.

“Does a free full body oil massage sound good?”
330 2018-08-20 23:15:56 A toxic spill is different the deregulation. Letting companies dump toxins in rivers(removal of the clean water act) or allowing companies to run risky oil pipelines through sacred lands. We got to do what we got to do... I get that. But why not progress towards cleaner energy?
331 2018-08-20 23:15:55 is coconut oil bad for the skin or what? i’ve a lot in my house and i don’t know what to do with it
332 2018-08-20 23:15:54 I like Aum Patchrapa, i watched her lakorn with Oil Thana, that one was good and Oil was so handsome 
333 2018-08-20 23:15:45 But not all oil production is equal. Bitumen in particular is resource-intensive to refine. That's not the same thing as "operating costs."
334 2018-08-20 23:15:40 Also, remember, Chris Watts told @Tomas_Denver7 on Tuesday that he just wanted his family to come home.  But some time after that told police he loaded the three bodies into his work truck, along with tools and such, and drove out to oil site.
335 2018-08-20 23:15:36 I love him so much wallahi, I believe Allah will use him turn the fortunes of our dear country . Things will change for better when. oil price stars picking. Infrastructure and security are getting better also . May Baba succeed.
336 2018-08-20 23:15:23 We pray to the jab jab God that he grants us thy strength to mash fence may our cups runneth over with all kinda rum our flesh covered with thy ole oil in his jably name we  pray amen

338 2018-08-20 23:15:14 More like which drug manufacturer funded. They’ll do anything to keep people from trying to be healthy. My mom won’t give my dad MCT oil because - saturated fat. He’s early stage dementia and this would help.

But no. Doctors and all.
339 2018-08-20 23:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this August? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
340 2018-08-20 23:14:58 Why don't you try working on  jobs health care eduction and getting our oil to market moron
341 2018-08-20 23:14:57 toner, hatomugi. moisturizer bio essence. cleansing oil simple
342 2018-08-20 23:14:49 So blessed to have good skin I don’t struggle w hours of getting ready just brows lipgloss and coconut oil on my lashes
343 2018-08-20 23:14:47 I was just telling my mom about how oil these used to be 
344 2018-08-20 23:14:40 Going to expose any Democrats? 
Surprise me.
345 2018-08-20 23:14:28 Well, errrr....the US attempted 2 coups and err....they rigged the financial markets to destroy  the economy and errr.....they embargoed the countries oil....and err...fomented and suported the violence in caracus last year.
346 2018-08-20 23:14:25 Do you want to learn more about CBD oil or Black Seed oil (Entrouage) come join my group 
347 2018-08-20 23:14:01 The amount of oil my face produces is ridiculous 
348 2018-08-20 23:14:00 What a load of shite. If that's the case why didn't he immediately phone the police and tell the truth. Why did he put his poor daughters in oil tanks and lie about it. He is a bloody psychopath.
349 2018-08-20 23:13:39 Eric Lipshaw's breath smells like motor oil.
350 2018-08-20 23:13:36 Today makes it 5 straight days without power supply,after a week long without power last week,if them born Una well,carry bill come my house @IkejaElectric
351 2018-08-20 23:13:30 I’m gettin on dis oil when I get off Fk it
352 2018-08-20 23:13:21 LOVE my BGE.  Also makes a killer pizza!  Olive oil and garlic base, mozzarella, fresh proscuitto, arugula, and shallot at the end.

My elk tenderloins are reserved for the BGE as well!

353 2018-08-20 23:13:20 I will never stop laughing at the fact that people take shitgibbons like Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones seriously enough to buy $65 vitamins. The literal snake oil salesman from Red Dead Redemption was smarter than this.

355 2018-08-20 23:13:11 Gurrrlll lemme give you my Granda’s number. He’s a mechanic and gets IRATE when oil change people try to upsell on stuff that doesn’t need it (like 90% of the time)
356 2018-08-20 23:12:53 Just for sake of comparison, you have 1 million attempts or successful crossings.
1% or 10,000 are not good people. Not a huge percentage overall, except if you or someone you know is a victim. Then it doesnt matter if its 1%, 20% or more.
357 2018-08-20 23:12:30 Stauffer said Justin Faulk could go to a few teams he named. But he said something to the effect of do not rule out a forward being involved if the Oil did do something with Carolina. Kassian needs a big bounce back this season he was invisible last year & struggled a lot the PK.
358 2018-08-20 23:11:53 Its all about the oil and Venezuela nationalised it......AGAINST THE CAPITALIST RULES INNIT.
359 2018-08-20 23:11:50 Stopped reading at using 2 litres of oil. Must be other method to make the dough edible surely. Like using an oven maybe? I don't know as well maar the oil is too much.
360 2018-08-20 23:11:47 luv 2 protect my country from lost oil company profits. oooh or from an autocratic regime that 10-20 years ago we propped up with mountains of guns and money only now to "have" to remove them
361 2018-08-20 23:11:46 Amin
362 2018-08-20 23:11:38 This is collusion by Big Oil....
363 2018-08-20 23:11:36 OMG. The absurdity of it all. Don’t eat coconut oil, eat more sugar!!!!
364 2018-08-20 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: chewy crust with greasy motor oil and ham.
365 2018-08-20 23:11:01 And when the oil runs out...
366 2018-08-20 23:11:00 Are the oil rigs okay?
367 2018-08-20 23:10:45 It’s cause we have oil
368 2018-08-20 23:10:42 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
369 2018-08-20 23:10:40 Good Lord. The US has attempted 2 coups, fomented ans supported last years violence in Caracus, rigged the finance markets and embargoed the countries oil....and you BLAME Venezuela?
370 2018-08-20 23:10:32 i finally got my direct deposit and immediately spent $700 on shit like health insurance and an oil change ahdndn
371 2018-08-20 23:10:20 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
372 2018-08-20 23:10:17 My guess is it's an oil that they produce. I know one of the commercial uses for rheas is their oil, though I don't know what for.
373 2018-08-20 23:10:14 Fish oil is disgusting, you know
374 2018-08-20 23:09:49 Two factors to consider: oil production is distributed broadly across the entire world. When one jurisdiction cuts back others tend to fill the gap. (Total CO2 emmisions produced stay roughly equal)

2: oil can and does get to coast by alternative means like trains and trucks
375 2018-08-20 23:09:34 I need to get some organic coconut oil.  For our teeth!
376 2018-08-20 23:09:33 hey i'd love to try living in Norway or Finland - both socialist countries.  Venezuela is in dire straights because of OIL and the US meddling in central and south america.
377 2018-08-20 23:09:18 Tea tree oil is great and will help get rid of the infection, ouch.
378 2018-08-20 23:08:33 Makes great lip balm though. Coconut oil is better on the outside of your body
379 2018-08-20 23:08:22 No, people able to add up are fuelling climate change denial as no part of it adds up. There are no oil barons except the Saudis etc, the businesses sell energy and prefer renewables as they get subsidies as well.
380 2018-08-20 23:08:11 When I slip on some oil or accidentally slap someone I’m blaming it all on you
381 2018-08-20 23:07:58 Boat
382 2018-08-20 23:07:55 Shouldn’t have to shampoo my own car an take it to gt an oil change 
383 2018-08-20 23:07:48 Dont have oil at my house nor a filter i have to go buy some
384 2018-08-20 23:07:46 ive seen doctors talk of a 500 fast for seven days then bk to 1500 for thee weeks repeat for four months , add cannabis oil and its cured x
385 2018-08-20 23:07:35 The largest oil reserves in the world #Venezuela
386 2018-08-20 23:07:30 Iran is not a friend of the USA. End of story. 
Another great idea take the weapons and oil from the saudis.
387 2018-08-20 23:07:29 I am waiting for him to declare the world is flat and all these so called scientists are paid by the left to say otherwise .  He already believes that global warming is a hoax because libs pay off scientists to say its real and bury “truth” to hurt oil.
388 2018-08-20 23:07:05 I saw Andrew Lucks last game he played in Lucas oil before his injury and I’m here tonight to see him back let’s goo #ibelieve
389 2018-08-20 23:07:04 With 2 litres of oil in this economy? That ish has to last me 30+ days.
390 2018-08-20 23:07:04 And they have oil, so all the other fucking countries don't say anything.
391 2018-08-20 23:06:52 2500 pesos por día me gasta el tractor y unos 400 la camioneta y eso es para producir 25 ha de tabaco . Por acá el gas oil ultra está a 32 pesos y 39 el infinia
392 2018-08-20 23:06:45 I need real life help and my mom won’t answer! How to I get an oil spot out of a shirt? I wasn’t paying attention when cooking and got three massive olive oil stains on my favorite shirt!  #HELPME
393 2018-08-20 23:06:30 (And we actually do use cannabis oil, it has its benefits but its not a cure)
394 2018-08-20 23:06:30 bro I went for a simple oil change and tire alignment and bro came out with a list of shit I needed to “give immediate attention” I’m like my dawg...
395 2018-08-20 23:05:53 Lunch
•Salad with grated carrots, minced galic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, red pepper flakes and parsley

•2 cups of water
396 2018-08-20 23:05:51 Some kind of really pungent pheromone oil for dudes to rub on their bodies that's scientifically proven to attract women, except all it does is make them smell terrible.
397 2018-08-20 23:05:49 .@SenWarren The constitution starts "We the people", not "We the rich white elderly men" not "we the friends of corrupt oil barons and coal millionaires" , but "We the people." Much stronger than MAGA. It's time @dnc bring a vision of hope.
#WeThePeople.
398 2018-08-20 23:05:41 It's too late China already control their oil supply, it was the only card they had left
399 2018-08-20 23:05:39 Atleast let the oil go back up before you start charging $30 lol
400 2018-08-20 23:05:39 #Breaking In the affidavit, "Chris said he went into a rage and ultimately strangled Shanann to death." He then told police he loaded the three bodies into his truck and took them to an oil site. #ChrisWatts
401 2018-08-20 23:05:17 Angela smiled as Amelie's hands expertly massaged the oil on her skin. She could get used to this.

"Of course, Schäri. Whenever you want me to."
402 2018-08-20 23:05:04 No you cannot. You think NASA and all scientists are cohorts in a gobal warming scam. Being trained in law really isn't a qualifier when it comes to world order conspiracy theories. Try imagine Brexit was a conspiracy and the oil barons are fueling climate change denial...
403 2018-08-20 23:04:58 I also don’t doubt the subjects’ suffering. Their symptoms are real. I agree - there’s always more research needed. But I despise these snake oil salesmen who rip people off.
404 2018-08-20 23:04:30 I knew this would be brought up, but I only had 240 characters. The strength of the Repunlican isolationist tendency waxes & wanes according to circumstances. I think Bush I was influenced by the alarm of the Gulf monarchies when Saddam invaded Kuwait. Oil talks.
405 2018-08-20 23:04:29 It seems like there should be other options for funding, rather than further increasing the burden on working families. Maybe we could stop subsidizing the oil and gas industry with tax breaks they don't need, or maybe tax big businesses and the wealthy at appropriate rates?
406 2018-08-20 23:04:26 Dude, I'd eat rat meat, but cooked properly, rather than with some chinese gutter oil.
407 2018-08-20 23:04:01 Lmao yeah its butter i just put butter in my beard to oil it up. I hate typos!!!!
408 2018-08-20 23:03:56 Cantu products are amazing and jamaican black castor oil for your scalp 
409 2018-08-20 23:03:55 rent is almost due my car needs an oil change bills piling up fuckkkk lmao
410 2018-08-20 23:03:50 Man I find I can eat enough. Not sure your caloric needs, but for me I have to add a lot of nuts and fish oil. I simply can’t eat that much meat and veggies in a day. I do like cheese quite a bit which is keto friendly. Most at least. Cheers and good luck to you. Update us...
411 2018-08-20 23:03:49 are you saying you're gonna oil me up with olive oil
412 2018-08-20 23:03:46 one of my daycare kids told me to smell his new cologne... it was a bottle of cbd oil he stole from his parents
413 2018-08-20 23:03:42 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
414 2018-08-20 23:03:36 How much does a oil change cost because I’m convinced Toyota is playing me..
415 2018-08-20 23:03:26 Stalingrad was an industrial and communication hub, a major corridor of access to central Asian oil fields, and commanded river transit on the Volga. Hardly unimportant.
416 2018-08-20 23:03:08 All they really care about is the oil money. Hell, all they have down there is rocks and goats.
417 2018-08-20 23:03:05 My dad said put oil in your car turn your car on let it warm up then open up the oil cap and see if any smoke comes out if smoke comes out then it has alot of blow back so the oils being burnt faster
418 2018-08-20 23:02:57 ugh she’s so pretty and articulate?? and I smell like oil rn because I was frying potatoes

421 2018-08-20 23:02:37 Until you want it again. So far for the spoilers, I’ve seen a Tarte palette, a juice beauty product and a Sol de Janeiro Glow oil plus we’re supposed to get the other 5 items we would in the regular Boxycharm. I hope this helped!
422 2018-08-20 23:02:36 Affidavit: Chris Watts told police his wife strangled the kids and he went into a rage and ultimately strangled Shanann to death. He then put bodies in his work truck and took them to an oil work site. Chris admitted he buried his wife and put the girls in oil tanks.

-grapefruit seed extract 
-tea made with filtered water, fresh ginger, turmeric, garlic, lemon 

all can be found @ organic markets or whole foods
424 2018-08-20 23:02:34 And that wonderful oil tax cut by our state legislature sure is a big hit for North Dakota’s budget.
425 2018-08-20 23:02:25 I think so?? as long as it doesn’t have any oil in it??

431 2018-08-20 23:01:17 No we dont. Saudi Arabia is an unstable oil state and funds Wahhabi terrorism all over the globe.

We should sanction them, take their oil, and take their weapons.

Iran, love it or hate it, is the most stable nation in the entire Middle East.
432 2018-08-20 23:01:12 How in the world is it logical, to Liberals like yourself, that the economic boom is because Obama, when Obama closed all mining & processing coal plants. Obama closed out of ~ 4,000 oil rigs down to ~300 or so working oil rigs in the U.S. Not to mention the "environmental taxes"
433 2018-08-20 23:00:56 CBD oil really is a blessing
434 2018-08-20 23:00:48 The details are gut wrenching.

He strangled his little girls.
Killed his pregnant wife and put them in oil containers.

F*cking monster.

441 2018-08-20 23:00:00 the growth rate will slow.  2010-2014= ~30% yoy U.S dome prod growth rates. About 8-10% since then.  Id expect 5% growth yoy for the next 5 years.  Bigger Q is what about the rest of major oil producers in the world? Most have actually declined in prod (Ven., Mex, Nigeria, Iran)
442 2018-08-20 23:00:00 Wish it was my birthday so my sister could buy this specialty ingrown hair oil for me.

445 2018-08-20 22:59:40 Its prob burning through oil bad, cause im sure they put oil atleast i hope 
446 2018-08-20 22:59:38 Blaming the banks for the crash is like blaming the oil companies for climate change.  They are the instruments through which it is happening but governments and consumers are culpable too
447 2018-08-20 22:59:17 Leave off Vic. I am old enough to remember the doubling of the oil price after the 73 war. The British economy never recovered.
448 2018-08-20 22:59:09 after 5 is burning the midnight oil in Texas?  On my way home at 2:30 I passed the local VampSquid office and there were people walking in already

I started off vegan but i had to switch to pescatarian cause the no protein was effecting my weight and energy tremendously !!! But i still don’t drink milk and no eggs but i don’t care about cheese lol
454 2018-08-20 22:58:09 I Just took a tablespoon of coconut oil. Ughh
455 2018-08-20 22:58:02 Why stay away from coconut oil?

459 2018-08-20 22:56:50 So I made grilled chicken and broccoli for dinner and I put too much sesame oil in, but it’s still really good. I started weight watchers and like this is no points, and I’ve stayed down 2lbs so I mean progress
460 2018-08-20 22:56:45 TIL that Tommy Tune is not a stage name. 

His dad was Jim Tune, an "oil rig worker, horse trainer, and restaurateur."
461 2018-08-20 22:56:34 Imagine taking your car in for routine oil change only to have the mechanic back your car into the wall because he can’t drive a manual transmission and then ask that you get three estimates on the cost for repairs when everything is booked up for months due to hail damage cbf
462 2018-08-20 22:56:25 Are you saying, "if we don't produce the oil, someone worse will"?
463 2018-08-20 22:56:23 expand your horizons Dj there’s more to life than gravy & bread with oil
464 2018-08-20 22:56:12 Amazing where do these people think the money would come from to fund this futility? Usual rhetoric be spouted oil  maybe bucket collections and eating magic mush rooms is way forward
465 2018-08-20 22:56:07 He should hv respected himself, nobody will body shame him except if the person is a bastard.
As the Saying goes,respect is reciprocal. But no,baba decided to exceed limits.
466 2018-08-20 22:56:05 Um... yes, oil prices have risen and fallen. When they fall dramatically, it causes their economy to collapse. It's not rocket science.
467 2018-08-20 22:55:59 Amen! My time of intimacy with the Lord gives me oil in my lamp that can be revealed as light through the words I write. #amwriting
468 2018-08-20 22:55:52 How does your hair respond to products containing coconut oil? 
469 2018-08-20 22:55:47 Needed dat oil change mannnn 
470 2018-08-20 22:55:46 Did he promise to give big corporations permanent tax breaks? Take away pre-existing conditions from insurance? Take away school lunches for children? Separate children and parents with no plan to reunite them? Sell off our national parks to big oil?

472 2018-08-20 22:55:36 I shocked my dad when I told him I checked my oil but he doesn’t know I only checked the digital diagnostics
473 2018-08-20 22:55:28 after u hit the oil pen 4x in a row is it normal to stand in front of the mirror making crazy faces at yourself for 7 minutes
474 2018-08-20 22:55:24 Sitting here getting my oil changed and the dude just asked for my number how do I politely tell him fuck no?
475 2018-08-20 22:55:20 Move to where the food is, as they say... in 2018 it appears to be in the oil fields of Texas.  Go there for a couple years, come back with skills, money and "the same opportunities"

477 2018-08-20 22:55:09 Prof. @steve_hanke   the measure is already a covert dollarization. It is a conversion box. It is a monetary anchor to the oil dollar. 3600 BS = 1 PETRO (unit of account, Not means of payment) = 1 Oil Barrel. If 1 Oil Barrel is produced and sold, it will enter $ 60,
478 2018-08-20 22:55:09 Our kind of #Shero, bound in protest of the sins of oil extraction.
This really is @JerryBrownGov #BrownsLastChance.
479 2018-08-20 22:55:01 You are a charlatan selling nonsense to the foolish. The only person who benefits from your classes is you. Another young punk selling snake oil. Lol
480 2018-08-20 22:54:54 Folks wanna run u around but don’t wanna run no tires..oil change..brakes..gas..car note or insurance money..like NO!
481 2018-08-20 22:54:51 Coconut oil was wishful thinking.
482 2018-08-20 22:54:35 Snake oil is probably better than the BS the left feeds us...
483 2018-08-20 22:54:29 Dig deeper and I bet He is making a killing on oil sales ,,but that's just my point of view
484 2018-08-20 22:54:25 Me or him? 
485 2018-08-20 22:54:15 #Oil Amazing that the growth in U.S. domestic oil production over the last 8 years (growth of ~7.4 Million bopd from 2010 to today) makes up almost 2/3rds of the total increase achieved in global oil output during the same time #DrillbabyDrill
486 2018-08-20 22:54:08 We can supply our own oil needs if we stop exporting. Let's give Saudi Arabia the old heave-ho. They held us over the (oil) barrel for so long we've forgotten we don't need them.
487 2018-08-20 22:54:06 Chaiii 
488 2018-08-20 22:54:02 Yeah but he's also an insufferable little twerp who uses too much olive oil.
489 2018-08-20 22:53:53 David Weiskopf from @NextGenAmerica agrees that California can and should and has developed policies that are exported to other places...it's time to do that for ramping down oil extraction as well. #BrownsLastChance @AirResources
490 2018-08-20 22:53:47 And yet they are failing miserably?  Don't think it's from the oil.  Just maybe it's because of the socialism?
491 2018-08-20 22:53:43 I have cramps and the gardeners are being loud and they also took my parking spot while I was gone getting an oil change, rude on top of rude on top of rude
492 2018-08-20 22:53:42 Why a oil change take so fkn long
493 2018-08-20 22:53:35 I am not sure what is worse: sitting through a 3-hour evening class about oil and gas or trying to figure out who I am going to pick for my Fantasy Draft's if my top picks fall through...
494 2018-08-20 22:53:32 I watched queer eye 3 times and bought a fancy beard oil. I still have neither a bed frame nor a regular toenail clipping routine. AMA
495 2018-08-20 22:53:24 Another day to take advantage of the Optimum oil cartridges being $5 off!!
496 2018-08-20 22:53:22 It wasn’t much better privatized in the 90s.and then the saudis sold cheap oil on the free mkt & that was Obama led.its all corrupt.
497 2018-08-20 22:53:21 Why am I even surprised that the person sitting opposite me is applying oil to her hair? At least she'll disembark with silky soft tresses #GoTrain
498 2018-08-20 22:53:18 Come on, man, for 150 years we’ve been dumping all sorts of crap into the atmosphere and we’re actually able to measure the adverse effects it’s having. Why are you fighting this? I know why the oil industry is, but why you?

502 2018-08-20 22:53:11 Having a fresh tank of oil is more satisfying than having a full tank of gas.
503 2018-08-20 22:52:15 Will never get why so many people are weenies about mayo. It’s pretty much eggs and oil!
504 2018-08-20 22:51:57 So at the very least I recommend the beard oil for your husband even if it doesn’t get too thick
505 2018-08-20 22:51:52 Vaccinations cause lizard-morphing! Don’t vaccinate! Public school is a brainwashing tool for the terminally uncool! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
506 2018-08-20 22:51:47 Always heat deep condition and spray your hair afterwards with aloe vera juice before you apply any oils or creams. Try to stay away from leave in products w/ coconut oil. Gently use a quality detangling brush whenever applying conditioner.
507 2018-08-20 22:51:38 ok so I thought the skinny pop made me react today but it’s GMO free so I should be able to eat it... except apparently I can’t have sunflower oil either so add that to the fucking list
508 2018-08-20 22:51:26 I'll try to do better sir 
509 2018-08-20 22:51:25 Yes. No joke, bub. Especially no plastics associated w meals, food/drink, storage, household stuff. 100% is not necessary but sure, minimize to the extreme gas, oil, plastics. That's been a healthy lifestyle in many American homes >50 y so don't worry about the kids. Catch up!
510 2018-08-20 22:51:24 Could anyone explain or point me in the right direction, about #CBD oil. I want to know more about it, it's effects (good and bad) and if its "legal" to be in your system (driving, employers etc). UK preferably. #CBDOil #chronicillness

546 2018-08-20 22:47:58 think its time i start doing papi shit and apply coconut oil on the hairs on my chinny chin chin
547 2018-08-20 22:47:55 And we also need to credit Obama and Clinton for continuing "foreign aid" to these countries that don't need foreign aid from US.  What they need is to fund their own development themselves out of the oil and other money they receive from their "investments."
548 2018-08-20 22:47:41 When Martha Stewart tweeted “Oil”... that shit spoke volumes
549 2018-08-20 22:47:40 Wouldn't say he's exhibited cowardice on climate, not at all. Dems in general need to turn down oil money/influence. There are climate champs left and right in Calif. What we need is to get all politicians out of WSPA's pocket.

563 2018-08-20 22:45:54 For a dry scalp you’re better with something like tea tree oil or a shampoo that has lots of natural oils in it to stop your scalp drying out
564 2018-08-20 22:45:41 Venezuela was also at one time prosperous and flowing with oil money... and then the hero of the left Hugo Chavez came and told everyone it’s the evil corporations fault and to revolt. 

Sound familiar?

It’s basically the story of today’s Democratic Party.

They are Bolsheviks

568 2018-08-20 22:44:55 Dandruff shampoo won’t help! Dandruff is actually the opposite of dry scalp, it’s when your hair forms too much dead skin and it often starts to flake once you let it get too oily. Dandruff shampoos suck the oil out to stop it flaming and will make your scalp dryer.

685 2018-08-20 22:29:36 You know a lot of the Middle East oil is running out, with Saudi's oil slated to run out by 2030. We need to make the shift now, unless you feel like paying $50 a gallon and slowly dying from the environmental impact of all this pipeline building & oil spilling.

703 2018-08-20 22:26:45 Sure, Putin and Trump are real pals. I’m sure Putin is thrilled with more US military spending, $ and equipment to Ukraine, our ending of Iranian “deal”, Trumps encouragement of domestic oil/gas production, restarting missile defense in Poland, and our coziness with Saudis.
704 2018-08-20 22:26:33 Joe rogan has a business called "onnit" that sells the low carb lifestyle. He sells lots of snake oil and it would be bad for his business if he had people criticize what he sells.  Plus all those low carb advocates are his friends who would also lose money.
705 2018-08-20 22:26:14 Fun fact: If you want to pamper your hair, try slathering your head with cold-pressed organic coconut oil. 

Lesson learned: You will smell like an Almon Joy. You will REALLY smell like an Almond Joy. 

...you may become an Almond Joy.

708 2018-08-20 22:25:38 Habría que ver por qué se les permite llegar a la playa. La pérdida de fluídos, aceite, refrigerante con glicoles tóxicos, gas oil, gases, contaminan la arena y el mar. Después nos quejamos de que las playas están sucias.
709 2018-08-20 22:25:32 And because this is Twitter and I’m required to say something awful: Fries and truffle oil are an unholy alliance that smell like b.o. and halitosis had a baby. Which is why I no longer eat at a ‘kitchen’ on the Westside.
710 2018-08-20 22:25:22 It's because their economy was proper up by high oil costs.
711 2018-08-20 22:25:17 "I am sure you will return the favour, cherie~" she said, leaning to whisper it into her ear, her skilled fingers slowly spreading that oil further along her back, gently outlining the borders of the fabric.

716 2018-08-20 22:24:23 Guys, I'm doing it. I'm going to use an essential oil to help Adler sleep longer. This mama is tired and the busiest time of the year at work is underway so I'll need all the help I could get.
717 2018-08-20 22:24:12 I see bitcoin and oil have started their synchronized swimming class.
718 2018-08-20 22:24:09 I refuse to be pessimistic about this - coal, oil, and inefficient gas plants are shutting down / dispatching less across the OECD.
719 2018-08-20 22:24:09 the #US , #SaudiArabia, and #UAE were hellbent on removing Assad - being Iran and Russia's ally. Terrorist were funded and armed by #US's oil buddies to fight against Assad, eventually ending up 70% of the "rebels" being Jihadists and terrorist.
720 2018-08-20 22:24:00 It's all about the oil - UK doesn't care if women or children are subjugated,  beheaded,  etc.

722 2018-08-20 22:23:19 What percentage of their exports does oil make up? Answer: 98.3% of their product shipment.
723 2018-08-20 22:23:15 i don't have any recipes. but my fave: peel them, slice like you're making chips / roast potato cubes, coat in oil & sprinkle with spice mix. i like old bay or a cajun kind of mix. roast til edges are crispy. eat them all crouching alone in the corner with the door locked

725 2018-08-20 22:23:03 .@BorensteinS discusses the way in which California sets a model for the world on #climate change. @AirResources workshop. Agreed. That's why we need California to set a precedent w/ a managed decline of oil and gas production in line with our climate goals. #BrownsLastChance

727 2018-08-20 22:23:01 Fed policy to raise rates to combat inflation is flawed and not applicable in today's economic world where 'supply & demand' is no longer the reason for price increases & inflation,i.e.,the crude oil market.

750 2018-08-20 22:21:06 US has the world reserve currency & a navy to back it up (10 supercarrier airgroups) that it is why it is the 'strongest'. Last time Iraq or Libya tried to sell oil in anything other than dollars they copped it. UK has one aircraft-less carrier & the GBP. No comparison possible!

796 2018-08-20 22:15:22 Oil price played role but not until c2005 onwards when they really took off.

845 2018-08-20 22:07:21 fireworks are the ABSOLUTE worst. And as far as his separation anxiety, I have to leave the tv on for him when he’s left alone....I did order the CBD oil so I’m crossing my fingers it helps him.
846 2018-08-20 22:07:16 How to cook Persian rice that is NOT sticky at all.
1 cup rice (rinsed until water is clear) 1 and a half cups water.
Bring water to boil, add drizzle of oil (olive oil, helps it not stick), salt to taste.
Add rice, bring back to boil.
Watch rice until water recedes and...
847 2018-08-20 22:07:15 I have a friend in CA who uses a high CBD/low THC oil in a vape pen. She swears by it. Her anxiety meds made her forgetful or drowsy or numb, depending on med and dose. On the vape oil, she's clear, engaged, and feels like a good version of herself.
848 2018-08-20 22:07:05 You might want to look into trying decarboxylated CBD oil for your pup. They tend to respond really well to it in that form.
849 2018-08-20 22:07:02 First off, the weather... it's Lucas Oil Stadium, so it's a climate-controlled indoor game. I'm guessing about 72 with no wind! Going out on a limb here...
850 2018-08-20 22:07:01 @GottliebShow In response to your comment last Monday, no PGA golfer has ever won a major after a joint surgery although there is an exception and he has won three. Surgery to repair joints are like oil and water. They don't mix.
851 2018-08-20 22:07:00 What kind of shitty snake oil service is this if you cant even include an american flag 
852 2018-08-20 22:06:29 Right-wing extremists hate and distrust the establishment--which includes the medical establishment, making a lot of them susceptible to the lures of snake oil cures.
853 2018-08-20 22:06:27 Big, thick wieners impaled on the long end with an over-sized peg and then dipped in some kind of pancake mix before being dunked in hot, boiling vegetable oil.
854 2018-08-20 22:06:21 He cleans up suprise!cat puke at 3am so you don't step into it the next morning. You gift him w/a cutlass from #baltimoreknifeandsteel. He joyfully displays all your #starwars art. You clean/oil his Faire boots (you're doing your own already).

857 2018-08-20 22:04:50 IT MUST GO 'VIRAL' ? Tell your wifes, daughter & friends of friends & everybody you know? 'SHARIA LAW' is an ugly message to American society? I saw the way women were treated, when on a oil tanker in the United Arab Emirates decades ago; it's not changed?

863 2018-08-20 22:04:19 actually in 2007 Venezuela demanded changes to the agreements made by the international oil companies that would give PDVSA majority control of the projects, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips refused, and as a result, their assets were expropriated.

866 2018-08-20 22:04:01 Summer and spring wouldn't bother me half as much if I didn't have weird reactions to allergies. Grass gives me hives and my eyes are super sensitive to everything in the summer. I've looked like I had pink eye for about a week. But no, it's inflamed and clogged oil glands. 
867 2018-08-20 22:04:01 The supplements look legit.  Caffine, creatine.....those things works.  What are you complaining about Krugman?  Dont look like snake oil to me.  Shows how smart you are.
868 2018-08-20 22:03:58 You're fucking trolling now.

875 2018-08-20 22:03:01 What socialist style countries? Most are free market based, high tax, highly public funded, generous welfare systems. They can only sustain with favorable trade inbalances or oil revenue, and high employment with high taxation. Doesn't take much to bring down the whole system.
876 2018-08-20 22:03:00 TRUTH—->”Unless there is a science-based standard of care and a mechanism of enforcement, these are just fake doctors exploiting a public who falsely believes they would be protected by the law and regulations. Not any more. The snake oil salesmen have won.”

883 2018-08-20 22:02:18 @_jrange I saw your snap about the car air fresheners a few days ago, the best one is Apalus Car Fragrance Diffuser Vent Clip (@AmazonUK) or the cheapest way is to put 3-4 drops of Essential Oil on cotton pads and pop it into the air vent !

886 2018-08-20 22:01:35 When you skin the potato (if you do), keep them in a tuboware. When you're hungry and want a nice snack but dont want chips, in a bowl put olive oil, some garlic salt and pepper. Roll the skins in it, bake at 350 degree for about 10 minutes or so.

Light salty snack.

Don't have to think too hard on that one.
906 2018-08-20 21:59:44 That’s easy for Ben to say. That man can drink motor oil and not feel the effects. You can’t, and there’s nothing wrong with that. You’re normal.
907 2018-08-20 21:59:41 Wow, really burning the midnight oil!
908 2018-08-20 21:59:37 In 81 I was on an oil rig paying 60% tax. 
Harry will have been paying higher rate 75% and his wife paying 55% in the early 70s. But his kids went to uni free 
909 2018-08-20 21:59:36 Paprika, salt/pepper, and lil cayenne. Cajun bone-in. I worked @ Morton's years and years ago and they had that marinated in oil and Cajun seasonings. Hands down second best steak next to the bone-in at Peter Lugers in Brooklyn NY.
910 2018-08-20 21:59:05 i tested out my hairmask stuff, but i miscalcuated the oil ratio. it was supposed to be under 25%, but it was more like 45%...

Carry olive oil incase things get nasty
916 2018-08-20 21:58:09 If he scraped the bottom of the barrel anymore with this comment, he probably strike oil.  This is being passed off as critical dialogue and is laughable. #MSM has no shame.

919 2018-08-20 21:57:35 Interesting thing about the vaccines it was derived from Cuba actually exporting doctors as a commodity. So they were incentivized by making more money abroad for their successes so they could market themselves to oil rich countries like Venezuela. Doctors were rewarded.
920 2018-08-20 21:57:30 people and at the same time getting stakes for himself. Look at other leaders of these oil rich regions,can we compare their achievements to Tinubu’s own? Not that I like it that way but in this system,I have to give it to him. Una go chop but me sef go chop>>na me go chop alone
921 2018-08-20 21:57:15 I was told the oil I put on smells so good cause it matches my PH...I thought that was interesting...they said it wouldn't smell as good on someone it wasn't a match for...

930 2018-08-20 21:55:52 sorry to hear that ashlee! here's a coupon for 15% off our cbd oil: Tweet15  I hope this helps!! Feel better dear 
931 2018-08-20 21:55:24 The world's entire economy runs on oil without a single soul able to dispute it factually. Oil is the blood that runs the heart and the heart is the middle east, period. Oil is money and money is oil. Then you wonder why the wars and..?! Its not that difficult to understand.
932 2018-08-20 21:55:21 That's tautological.
If it weren't totally oil based it wouldn't be an oil economy. If it were allowed to ballance itself it wouldn't long be an oil economy.
933 2018-08-20 21:55:18 Perfume oils you buy abroad and the ones sold in Nigeria is very different. Because my Elizabeth and James perfume oil actually came in an Elizabeth and James oil not a tiny see through bottle with paper taped over it.
934 2018-08-20 21:55:04 niggas was going crazyyy for that ambre oil in that hot weather  my secret weapon
935 2018-08-20 21:55:04 Take a year round growing climate add in some of the largest oil reserves in the world and sprinkle on some socialism and this is what you get, an utterly broke nation full of starving people.
936 2018-08-20 21:54:59 Your welcome "Oil Tot". We love you and that love is only going to help your channel grow! Sending you a warm hug on making the big four hundred!
937 2018-08-20 21:54:59 .....Because you are right for a year nothing was done, even the ministers weren’t picked and even after that, there was no strategy to stem the tide. But in all fairness the Global Oil Crash which has affected even SAUDI Arabia.......
938 2018-08-20 21:54:53 I actually just started using CBD oil, ill let you know the brand when im home but I know HempWorx is a well known brand with good standing.
939 2018-08-20 21:54:49 Raspberry vinegar and olive oil for a sore throat. Or a cough I can’t remember. My mum admitted that she used to neck the gripe water!!
940 2018-08-20 21:54:46 @OfficialSCANPAN absolute GARBAGE...do not buy. Would have been nice to know freaking olive oil ruins your shitty pans. Life time guarantee? Right.
941 2018-08-20 21:54:41 Why is Iran an enemy of the US?How did that happen? Have you read how the US & UK overthrew a democratically elected leader who nationalized the oil in 1950s? Do you know anything at all about the history of the area,other than Zio propaganda that you're taught at Hasbara school?
942 2018-08-20 21:54:38 That must be good news to you. The only glimmer of hope that this country has had for decades is Corbyn and you are doing anything and everything to get rid of him. 
Sale your snake oil somewhere else.

944 2018-08-20 21:54:19 Yet it's the Jews that invent & discover things and have pushed society forward with their intelligence. But the Arab muslim's have not invented anything. It was the White man that discovered oil on their land & introduced sanitation where they once used goats for sanitation.
945 2018-08-20 21:53:52 who has oil carts?
946 2018-08-20 21:53:47 The average price of Oil in 2008: $91 /  2009: $53 /  2010: $71. Juxtapose that with 2015: $41 / 2016: $36 /  and 2017: $42 (This is the nominal without adjusting for Inflation) You can still see the difference and why the most recent Is worse, NOT covering for FG or APC........
947 2018-08-20 21:53:42 I sure did ! Stir fried it in sesame oil with a splash of soy sauce and sesame seeds as a side dish to my salmon !!

952 2018-08-20 21:52:43 @PeterAttiaMD hey! I’m trying to sort out my health, which has gotten away from me. Just when I think I have a handle on what to do (from listening to you and other keto/paleo/ancestral health folks), I read some Harvard doc says coconut oil is poison.
953 2018-08-20 21:52:27 Using herbal aromatherapy facial steams (also called facial saunas) once a week is an excellent way to cleanse and revitalize your skin (especially good for oily, acne-prone skin.) Face steams open up the pores, helping to get rid of excess oil, along with deep-down dirt & grime.
954 2018-08-20 21:52:23 Thanks for joining the growing chorus calling on @JerryBrownGov to confront CA's dirty oil extraction before #GCAS2018!
955 2018-08-20 21:52:18 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
956 2018-08-20 21:52:15 Would you provide context? What's their entire economy based on? Oil? Has nothing to do with Socialism...
957 2018-08-20 21:52:10 Look at labels... better to pay more at checkout than pay the real price for palm oil.
958 2018-08-20 21:52:07 @victoria_lomeli is an essential oil peddler better watch out
959 2018-08-20 21:52:01 That likely means that there is not oil.  Just water.
960 2018-08-20 21:51:59 I know what your tweet said but this is NAS. You can’t mix oil and water.......kanye has been on new revolutionary shit since yeezus. Only thing we can say about nas is that he’s an idiot for even agreeing to making that album.
961 2018-08-20 21:51:54 Ehhhh ke sebab ni eh. Mineral oil boleh clog pores. Ni something new. Muka aku pun lama dh ada jerawat halus tu. Entah2 since aku pakai ni kot. Kena cari simple plak. Nasib baik biore aku nk hbs dah. Thanks ma

967 2018-08-20 21:50:55 We gotta look at labels for ingredients.  Palm oil's price is too damn high.
968 2018-08-20 21:50:33 to my point we will always need oil in some capacity we can cut down but oil is here to stay
969 2018-08-20 21:50:17 The Passion of Christ, 14 paintings, oil on canvas, 16 in X 20 in panels, $3000 for all 14 paintings
970 2018-08-20 21:50:10 Canada may have gotten off to a good start, but I don't expect it to last. Too much (perceived) at stake: still a belief that SA holds sway over other ME countries, stable oil prices, etc. Had hopes for recent leadership in SA but like other countries (eg, Turkey): nada.
971 2018-08-20 21:49:52 Oil prices higher than 2015 no PMI recession and we got the corp tax cuts with a better economy

USD/UAH: 27.64 (-0.32%)
973 2018-08-20 21:49:39 As palm oil has highest yield of any oilseed crop (over 10x the oil yield per hectare of soy and 5x the yield of rapeseed) this would be true unless we reduce demand for ALL types of vegetable oil ( less deep fried food like chips & no more biodiesel from oilseed crops)
974 2018-08-20 21:49:37 White come to Africa steal our wild live animals, steal our gold, oil etc. Use Africa as an Experiment ground, if whites are so superior like you claim, why not allow Africa to have United Africa, why did you guys kill Muammar Al Gathafi? Shame to you also (4)

977 2018-08-20 21:49:07 Always raggedy ass people tweeting this shit, I'm sure no one bought her "perfume oil" after all the RTs 
978 2018-08-20 21:49:07 It won’t work even Lenin said that democracy and socialism are like water and oil, there’s no such thing as democratic socialism, the end goal of any kind of socialism is communism, you have many examples of that in history
979 2018-08-20 21:48:52 Bitumen in particular needs the cost savings though, because they have a particularly high cost to refine. It's always on the verge of being economically viable or not, depending on world oil prices and costs. Anything to encourage leaving coal and bitumen in the ground, imo.
980 2018-08-20 21:48:51 Just curious why would anyone need this crap? Krill oil and joint warfare are legit. Fat burning stuff is not. Do MORE burpees. Surprised y’all are pushing this stuff....

982 2018-08-20 21:48:32 If my hair is still dry as a bone tomorrow after drowning it in oil I will scream
983 2018-08-20 21:48:28 They can't even get people to dig the oil out of the ground cause they don't even have skilled labor anymore 
984 2018-08-20 21:48:27 I’m looking into getting cbd and hemp oil treats for Bella because she’s almost always on edge especially with the cats at Matt’s house and has major separation issues. Anyone have any suggestions for brands or have tried treats like that with no luck?
985 2018-08-20 21:48:22 I thought about trying nootropics a few years ago. After seeing Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan shilling for them, I realize I dodged the biggest bullet ever. I’ll get oil from my own snakes.
986 2018-08-20 21:48:17 On the one hand, it seems a bit silly to claim that Just Cause 4 is a sly commentary on climate change. On the other, its hard to ignore that it's already a series about forcing regime change by causing unfathomable amounts of infrastructure damage, focusing on gas and oil.
987 2018-08-20 21:48:07 what type of heating system do you have?

Gas?
Solid Fuel?
Oil?

Like,share and comment?
988 2018-08-20 21:48:01 Because they put all their backing into oil reserves and it took a single oil glut to destroy them. Funny how it works when you put all the power into a small group of people w/o checks. Show me a socialist state that isn't a failure

1000 2018-08-20 21:46:24 They know their audience. Back in the early 29th C, if you bought snake oil via mail for, say, piles, the quack would sell your address to other quacks with details of your embarrassing condition. Now they do it with cookies, I suppose.
1001 2018-08-20 21:45:53 They are awful. My hearing and sight and everything go. I can't a ringing in my ears that's when I know I'm about to have one. Have you ever tried Cbd oil?

1009 2018-08-20 21:45:09 Yes, I do! I know, it’s basically a nightmare trying to buy food that fits in with my ethics tbh. Everything has something like palm oil in that I won’t eat 
1010 2018-08-20 21:45:01 When you go to get an oil change and find out you need more work than you expected  won’t get done today...I know that
1011 2018-08-20 21:44:53 this is just such a fallacy of composition -- when people on the right say that because nationalization is an aspect of socialism, the state of the venezuelan oil industry is an ipso facto condemnation of socialism itself, the left screams bloody murder, and rightly so!

1014 2018-08-20 21:44:48 G'day from Australia, Nicholas, 

You can't eat oil or petros. Get your people to plant quick growing food,  now. 

And, check the Maraicaibo bridge. It appears on Google Earth to be buckled on the west end. 

Good luck

1019 2018-08-20 21:43:56 Guys my car just broke down after I spent almost $100 on an an oil change that I could barely afford I am so upset
1020 2018-08-20 21:43:48 Yeah - still with oil here, too. Heat pump will be the next thing. Oil sucks. It smells like hell when it leaks - and there are ALWAYS leaks. :(
1021 2018-08-20 21:43:07 I’m curious, albeit this is quite a generalization -> what’s an optimum oil price that you have seen from the data at which both gasoline consumers & upstream oil and gas companies are happy?

1025 2018-08-20 21:42:32 Brent Oil Spot is heading towards 50/200 day MA Death Cross. There is time to avoid but only if Bulls get serious pronto.
1026 2018-08-20 21:42:23 What makes no sense is I just got an oil change a month ago. HOW IS THERE NO OIL IN MY CAR. I DONT HAVE A LEAK EITHER.
1027 2018-08-20 21:42:21 I've eaten absolute shite the last week cos I was ill. I can't wait to eat like normal food? Shit with vitamins and that? Less oil? Maybe do a shit before Xmas
1028 2018-08-20 21:42:15 It's obvious pseudo social elite holding power, vaccinations are an obvious suspect to dumb down poor people and shorten their lives, Kos unexpected enrichment has gone on for years with hypocritical snake oil doctors cashing in on the uneducated #vaccination
1029 2018-08-20 21:42:11 Simple physics tells me the best way to stop an oil leak is to stop putting in more oil.
1030 2018-08-20 21:42:02 Oil is not anybody’s invention really is it. Your statement was superfluous. And vindicated my earlier appraisal of your technique.
1031 2018-08-20 21:42:00 I need that one type nap. Can’t wait to get home after this oil change 
1032 2018-08-20 21:41:47 If I ask for the bare minimum oil change, what makes you think I want windshield wipers too? I can barely afford the oil
1033 2018-08-20 21:41:38 The wheels of justice are slow AF...my dream would be that they throw him in an oil well.
1034 2018-08-20 21:41:35 These countries have populations the size of Houston, and oil money coming in. In that scenario, I’m sure free health care is doable.

1044 2018-08-20 21:40:28 TO BE CLEAR: my comment as per Bush #2 was sarcasm.  I sent two daughters off to his wars in the sand for oil and they will never be the same.  Sarcasm is how I deal.
1045 2018-08-20 21:40:27 It will drive you nuts, probably piss oil, coolant & other stuff, annoy you with minor problems, but just remember they were built by Brummies moaning about the weather and just like a good Brummie it will moan on forever. You’ll love it

They don’t mix. lnp choose a dollar over environment, always
1050 2018-08-20 21:40:12 Sir if I am not wrong, north sea has some oil. Also sir, you are a great mind but i think you forget that UK has huge reserves of coal(the fuel of that time) when they started conquering.
1051 2018-08-20 21:40:04 But of course you're not part of the CofE at all. Entirely seperate.

Entirely coincidental that you give CofE 80-90% of your insurer profits each year.

With senior CofE clerics on both boards of the nexus to oil the wheels and keep the deal sweet.

1056 2018-08-20 21:39:37 That’s right! Proof that the “deep state” is what it always has been. The Military industrial complex, oil and banks. Yes democrats take that money too, they have to in order to compete. If their half bad, some make a good effort while we can be assured republicans are 100% sold.

Big money in politics is the other.
1075 2018-08-20 21:37:43 Iran sanctions are good to force Iranian regime to backtrack their nuclear proliferation and stopping  export of terrorism to Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Bahrain. India/China should cut Iranian oil imports to zero.
1076 2018-08-20 21:37:38 Exactly right, Mark. Grandson didn't get license until 17. I was at DMV morning of 16th birthday. Had already been changing points & plugs, changing oil. Even bought JC Whitney chrome oil filler cap for '57 Chevy and installed seat belts I bought at Sears Automotive. No more.
1077 2018-08-20 21:37:17 It was sarcasm.  I do NOT miss Bush #2. To be clear:  I gave two USAF Daughters to his wars in the sand for oil.  Sarcasm is the only way for me to deal
1078 2018-08-20 21:37:15 Oil companies have spent 3 billion to cover global warming. Big pharma has spent 3 billion to hold down marijuana and other natural remedies.

Big money corrupts.

1112 2018-08-20 21:33:51 Because I blame my country for a lot of things like butting in years ago overthrowing countless regimes including in iran where we helped over throw democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh . Usa is all about greed , oil and bullying !
1113 2018-08-20 21:33:37 GOP supporters of #KXL (@SenatorFischer @GovRicketts et al.)were proud to authorize eminent domain to a foreign oil co.-allowing a land grab by a foreign co. fr. NE land owners.Your scenario is true in this case for voters supporting GOP—but @TransCanada will be defeated!

1114 2018-08-20 21:33:26 So one question I have been struggling with - are the agreements between ME and others receiving Physical gold  for oil still in place and is there evidence of this? Any thoughts?
1115 2018-08-20 21:33:24 They get the waste... the crop is for oil so it's already being used

ME: The hair oil!

Her: Blank Stare

Me: Gosh im old

Btw why that hair oil stop selling?
1120 2018-08-20 21:32:48 We may need to put an oil refinery in their back yard.
1121 2018-08-20 21:32:45 Why no coconut oil? What about MCT?
1122 2018-08-20 21:32:32 Im tired of your repetition of propaganda against turkey. Us operations in the region only helped chaos to grow  and terror to sprout. Check us' allies in region. one is bombing around behind walls, one came with coup and the last is oil rich most exterimist country in the world
1123 2018-08-20 21:32:19 Where are the calculations for deaths caused by air pollution created by coal or oil (smog).  We need cleaner air standards period, no matter what the fuel source.  Calculating worker deaths by megawatts produced is a false equivalent and its beneath a PHD to even suggest it.
1124 2018-08-20 21:32:16 Agreed. I petitioned against the XL pipeline, you will soon be receiving the most toxic oil on Earth.
1125 2018-08-20 21:32:03 I’m gonna try to use coconut oil instead of using butter. I hope it’s tasty too

1127 2018-08-20 21:31:58 I was stressed about having to get my oil changrd but Groupon told me one of the coupons I bought a while ago expired so they gave me credit. and THEN when i went to go check out, i had credit left over from another one so i didnt have to pay out of pocket 
1128 2018-08-20 21:31:50 ITV News tonight reporting on raging inflation in Venezuela lists the problems with one glaring omission - USA sanctions. They did mention the biggest oil reserves in the world but not that the US will do anything to get their hands on it!
1129 2018-08-20 21:31:46 Iconic Bond  but funny how cars now come with most of this equipment fitted as standard, twin .30 cal machine guns, oil spray, ejector seat...….
1130 2018-08-20 21:31:46 90+% of workplace deaths are men. Let's get more women into skyscraper window washing and logging and fisheries and machine work and oil drilling so we can equalize these gender disparities and end men's DEATH PRIVILEGE !
1131 2018-08-20 21:31:43 No attacks on women's rights, the protection of LGBTQ rights, no extremist RW views, acknowledgement of the effects of climate chance and actions to address it, consideration for all Albertans not just Oil Companies.

1149 2018-08-20 21:30:20 hey @VicGalloway. Highlight of the weekend was catching Omni the other night at the Hug and Pint. Saw them both a bunch of times but Kaputt and Banana Oil (The B'O's) continue to deliver the goods. Two of the best bands in the country at the moment!

1151 2018-08-20 21:30:08 Oil is an arab invention? Since when? It's the West who taught arabs how to pump and monetize it. And these days, arab oil is hardly needed. You just used Israeli technology to tweet, though....
1152 2018-08-20 21:30:06 I lived in Texas and didn’t especially like living in a city with 2x more people than in all of KS, but Texas has amazing 60 year run of economic growth and wealth creation, and lots of that is not attributable to oil or tourism. And their legislature only meets every other year.

1159 2018-08-20 21:29:44 I have so much oil in my hair. It smells amazing ! 
1160 2018-08-20 21:29:43 Fecking hippies.  Each one of em are wearing garments and footwear derived from oil. Each mobile phone =oil. Each motor vehicle driven = oil. Each residence = oil. Hypocrites.  Shameful anarchistic behaviour. @ruthhayhurst #ukog @Anton13579 @Adrianwfire
1161 2018-08-20 21:29:22 Trump says immigrants committing rape, assaults & murder. So how come its white men killing wives & small children. Colorado man hid young daughters bodies in an oil barrel/buried pregnant wife? Shooting up school kid's? @POTUS sexually assaults 19 women.? 300 Priests rape in PA?
1162 2018-08-20 21:29:20 And don’t you think if there was tapes, Hillary would have spent all her money for them to win?! If there was a tape it would of been released a long time ago. Just @OMAROSA  being a dirty snake oil saleswoman!
1163 2018-08-20 21:29:11 Rappers going at it. That's really nothing new. But the world seems intrigued by it all. Meanwhile, the Word of God goes unread. God continues to be neglected. And Jesus is soon to return. Why aren't we preparing for eternity? We all need to read about the ten virgins & the oil.
1164 2018-08-20 21:29:10 Not pasta and eggs. But I do eat pasta for 'breakfast' sometimes. Sometimes just a little bit of capellini with olive oil and garlic, maybe a little parmesan

1166 2018-08-20 21:29:01 Once again Ms Romney you speak in partial truths at best ! Venezuela is now and has been a Corrupt Dictatorship where the Rich and those close to govt prospered on the backs of the poor and an oil spigot you know like you and your party’s new bestie PUTIN
1167 2018-08-20 21:28:56 In the oldest oil you can find with the highest percentage of saturated fats that oil has ever had in the history of vegetable oil

Sprinkle with good Italian or Kosher salt and enjoy-No pepper-It takes away from the truffle
1173 2018-08-20 21:28:28 I’ve been taking the oil for a month now, and using the cream for two months...,has definitely helped with inflammation, pain, anxiety and sleep!
1174 2018-08-20 21:28:20 The oil companies are exactly the same as the tobacco companies; they both live off blood money.
1175 2018-08-20 21:28:15 I have the opposite problem with my mom she makes me use raw coconut oil for cooking purposes.

1182 2018-08-20 21:27:52 Waste from oil production..... the crop would still be needed
1183 2018-08-20 21:27:51 It’s a lengthy process but it’s worth it. You can use coconut oil to aid the stretch if your ears are ready but are being stubborn haha. But don’t push it. 
1184 2018-08-20 21:27:49 Needs to be a service to take your car to get oil changes & bring it back because I really don’t have time to be sitting in there 
1185 2018-08-20 21:27:43 Maybe it is unpopular because it is hard to imagine how one can separate climate change policy from government investment in a pipeline that will make economic the accelerated expansion of carbon-intensive oil extraction. Supply and demand exist in the same economic system.
1186 2018-08-20 21:27:32 Got the squeaking noise fixed on my car. The clip that holds the stuff for the ABS was rubbing on the back side of the rotor. Now just need a oil change and a deep clean before trios.
1187 2018-08-20 21:27:29 Curious, What portion of oil $ goes to Putin, oligarchs, investors, workers, Russ taxes ? compared to an Exxon or a cheniere or UK, Norway, Saudi, Venezuela, Mexico.
1188 2018-08-20 21:27:22 The Extreme oil and the Holy oil will take not only anxiety away but took my severe PTSD away. They will change how you eat. You won't want junk food anymore. They kill pain on contact. They break addictions. Cannabis is an essential nutrient. Contact me at myholyoil@yahoo.com
1189 2018-08-20 21:27:20 I was ok until I took my contacts out after making pico de gallo and guacamole
Learned to rub vegetable oil on hands before touching Jalapenos or other chilis and then I'm able to blue dawn all of it off when I finish chopping
1190 2018-08-20 21:27:13 It’s fine. Almonds are oily so the oil can go rancid, but even then it won’t hurt you (it just smells bad)

1198 2018-08-20 21:26:44 I'll readily admit I don't know the deep politics of the oil sector here in Canada. Most if it gets couched in east/west or west/westier divisive politics and the facts get buried under regional jingoism.

1211 2018-08-20 21:25:03 The money on defense is BS and you know that is all the GOP will spend money on. Meanwhile, Zinke is selling off our national parks, they are backing oil cos. instead of renewables, protections are off the environment, animals & resources and the planet is on fire.

1217 2018-08-20 21:24:18 She’s only 21 doing all that. And she sun tans with olive oil. She is going to look kind of scary when she starts getting old if she keeps it up.
1218 2018-08-20 21:24:17 So in the further exploration of the contrast in my sister and myself.. she got an oil painting/portrait of one of her horses done...
1219 2018-08-20 21:24:16 I told my grandma Rex keep bothering me he need the lord in his life. She said “Tell him come over so I can bless him with this blessing oil & holy water.” 
1220 2018-08-20 21:24:11 Production this summer hit 10.9 million bpd, and the EIA expects it to rise further to 11.7 million bpd in 2019, which would make the country the biggest oil producer in the world, provided Saudi Arabia and Russia continue pumping at their current level
1221 2018-08-20 21:24:08 I’m guessing if we had oil like the Middle East the attention from the international fraternity would be totally different... but oh well

1222 2018-08-20 21:24:01 My father was in England in the 70s on business. He stayed at his hosts home. They turned  OFF the oil heat at 8 o'clock because it was too expensive. They were a middle class family.
1223 2018-08-20 21:23:54 Inflation is such an abstract idea that can mean different things in different situations. Cost-push inflation due to rising oil prices can be a friction to economic activity while low/moderate inflation due to demand can actually be a good thing.
1224 2018-08-20 21:23:32 That robot had a long oil change weekend. He needs a Monday to recuperate.  
1225 2018-08-20 21:23:30 You have to learn to people, if you want your women and your country grow and not being seen as an "oil cows field", you should learn your people. Women become dangerous only when they love you ,)
1226 2018-08-20 21:23:29 Your good at filling rollers with oil. You should be fine 
1227 2018-08-20 21:23:27 United States no longer needs to conserve oil as domestic production increases have reduced the need for imports. As a result, the United States has been given “more flexibility than in the past to use our oil resources with less concern
1228 2018-08-20 21:23:25 The bank said you better keep the oil changed in their truck

Example: just switching to electric buses+grants save =$200,000/bus ($10 million for 50 buses) net on a 12 year life (no fuel, no oil changes, no emissions etc.).  The cost, environmental & health benefit/savings are big!

1237 2018-08-20 21:21:56 I praise the people of Yemen for not welcoming a puppet ruler by the U.S. We must stop starting these wars over the dollars and oil. Free trade with no tariffs would fix that. Go Trump

1244 2018-08-20 21:21:22 So this children used all my groundnut oil to fry potatoes and even washed the remaining one in the frying pan off 
1245 2018-08-20 21:21:14 Is that all though? I mean, I can think of other things that she may need too. Blessed oil, a cross, a horcrux, all of them.
1246 2018-08-20 21:21:11 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
1247 2018-08-20 21:21:10 Have you checked into Black Seed Oil- there is some evidence based research indicating it helps addictions.
1248 2018-08-20 21:21:06 Bae outside doing an oil change on my truck while I nap in the ac....5 bajillion gold stars
1249 2018-08-20 21:21:02 I've tried using margarine and I don't like it tbh veggie oil is the best
fried rice for my fam is like oil and then tomatoes, carrots, and chicken broth it's kind of like what's in omurice except uh

i didn't ever think it was weird but I told no nonhispanic ppl about it and
1250 2018-08-20 21:21:00 That isn’t how an oil based economy works.
1251 2018-08-20 21:20:57 Hahahaha. Mikey  

You are oil from Akara. 

Shit. I can't even do pretentious poetry. Thank you!
1252 2018-08-20 21:20:56 just remembered the time i ate raw coconut oil (which i had purchased for skincare purposes) just to prove a point to my mom
1253 2018-08-20 21:20:48 This is literally an Alex Jones move. It's all snake oil and other extraneous bullshit.
1254 2018-08-20 21:20:32 Finally sat up my oil change appt tomorrow 
1255 2018-08-20 21:20:24 Wow, Dave... you've gone off onto more tangents.
The Oil  & Gas Conservation Commission.  They set energy policy for the state of Alaska.
Its interesting that you keep saying that we are "obsessed" with her intelligence, yet, you won't give ONE defense to it.

1257 2018-08-20 21:20:01 "I am not a snake oil salesman! Now please consider purchasing snake oil from me, an honest broker!"
1258 2018-08-20 21:20:00 So apparently coconut oil is actually not good for you at all??? It’s actually really fucking bad for you???
1259 2018-08-20 21:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

1261 2018-08-20 21:19:44 Unpopular opinion: everyone talking about pipelines and climate change re: #BCfires STAWP! Pipelines are irrelevant to climate change. Only action to reduce demand for oil/reduce carbon intensity of each barrel of oil will. Fight climate change with sound economics plz
1262 2018-08-20 21:19:42 Just closed it for a $160 win! Not bad for a beginner Johnny doing only my 2nd Crude Oil trade! Thanks so much for helping me learn the skills and get the confidence to do this! 
1263 2018-08-20 21:19:37 Is big oil not subsided to the tune of billions of dollars a year?
1264 2018-08-20 21:19:25 As an Albertan, this issue makes me angrier than almost any other. The dismal legacy of the PC party: lack of oversight, lack of environmental standards, lack of holding oil companies accountable. Future generations will pay a serious price for their reckless years of governing.
1265 2018-08-20 21:19:21 I want parties that represent something other than war, banks, Wall St., big oil, big pharma, etc.

You can't seriously believe it is better to keep two corrupt parties left unaccountable by 1-choice voting.

I respectfully disagree.

Aside from higher standard of living,  it is a National Security issue.  Further, we should be exporting energy.  Jobs.  JM
1268 2018-08-20 21:19:04 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1269 2018-08-20 21:19:03 Erm. Oil?
1270 2018-08-20 21:18:44 OK. Well, I'd say that the oil industry has long had a pet province ;-).
1271 2018-08-20 21:18:28 Data is more valuable than gold or oil. The biggest companies own less and do more for free. Fees are taxes, open source the future.
1272 2018-08-20 21:18:09 of course someone goes and spills their piss scented fish oil on the floor right next to me at work :) love self check outs

1274 2018-08-20 21:18:05 Global oil consumption is projected to continue increasing at least until 2040. If Canada curtails its oil production other nations will gladly supply the difference. #SaudiOilIsBest

1276 2018-08-20 21:17:57 This is why I eat very very little processed food. I cook whole foods and use very little animal fat, sugar and salt. I use date paste in place of sugar for baked goods, and coconut and olive oil in place of butter.
1277 2018-08-20 21:17:54 What can you do with the Oil?
1278 2018-08-20 21:17:49 Where's the head ? Get some oil #WhoIsAmerica

1282 2018-08-20 21:17:00 spring onions and gherkins and mayo and olive oil and balsamico.  Plus lots of salt and ground pepper.
1283 2018-08-20 21:17:00 We are all waiting.
1284 2018-08-20 21:16:47 It will all get easier as time goes on, but there are so many things to remember at first. If you go out for food, you need to check things like if chips are cooked in same oil as other battered items. If so, we can't eat them.
1285 2018-08-20 21:16:47 i feel like a oil gland
1286 2018-08-20 21:16:31 Oil kills thousands daily due to emissions from incomplete combustion in inefficient gasoline engines.
1287 2018-08-20 21:16:29 Severin Borenstein, at @AirResources workshop, ventures into "ethical oil" arguments often used by Cdn tar sands producers, in order to defend dirty CA oil production. We've heard it before. It's a red herring. Time for a managed decline of oil prod in CA. #BrownsLastChance
1288 2018-08-20 21:16:28 CBD oil works for pain management. And it’s legal.
1289 2018-08-20 21:16:27 That's why POTUS slithers out of everything; all that slick money! Everything and anything he does just slides right off of him!  If it's not oil money its gun money, both of the most powerful things in America!
1290 2018-08-20 21:16:22 Yh cause the chips legit just came out the oil thing they are cooked in lol and it burnt me through the paper lmao
1291 2018-08-20 21:16:20 Sasol more a chemicals company than an oil company.
1292 2018-08-20 21:16:17 .. I swear that na why anywhere I see cows ..  .. Baba i dey do azuwaya.. ASAP.
1293 2018-08-20 21:16:17 2008? Yes, the year of the greatest worldwide financial crisis in 80 years and a world where GDP growth headed south into deep negative territory. To think Harper weathered that and a 2014 collapse in oil prices ... yet still got us to balance budget 2015.
1294 2018-08-20 21:16:09 These are matters of life-and-death for our country, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
1295 2018-08-20 21:16:04 You should try cbd oil! It really helps with my anxiety
1296 2018-08-20 21:16:04 It's eggs, oil and vinegar lmfao
1297 2018-08-20 21:16:03 If the #US Gov can fine #BP $billions for a single oil rig incident why does it not deal with the #Catholic Church, one of the wealthiest bodies in the world, in a similar fashion for something that is many times worse???? @realDonaldTrump
1298 2018-08-20 21:16:01 How can you change Citizens United if we don't have democracy?

I claim that 1-choice voting is only the illusion of democracy.

You get to the polling booth and their is no way to vote against Citizens United, war, Wall St., big pharma, fracking, big oil, bank deregulation...
1299 2018-08-20 21:15:59 Thank you, I can’t wait for any news from Zaza.
1300 2018-08-20 21:15:58 4 Jesus left this physical gift to mankind to heal us and each other. He gave his life to do it. The religions teach us there is only 1 Trinity and there are 2. the 2nd is the elemental Trinity from which the Holy oil comes from. Earth, Air, Water. If you heal them they listen.
1301 2018-08-20 21:15:48 Lol keep that oil changed and keep antifreeze in that radiator
1302 2018-08-20 21:15:47 i guess that beard oil wasn’t cutting it ehh
1303 2018-08-20 21:15:45 @Microsoft where are the backlit keyboards?!?!? I would buy the "Designer Bluetooth® Desktop" RIGHT NOW if it had backlit keys. We creatives like to burn the midnight oil.
1304 2018-08-20 21:15:38 Has the lavender essential oil on a cotton ball really helped my earache, or is it just a placebo effect? I may never know.
1305 2018-08-20 21:15:35 Granted he will be giving the world FREE ENERGY that has been given to us by our new friendly ~ALIENS~. No more fuel oil expenses for YOU. >EVER<. Also wheel less cars that fly at an extremely fast rate of speed and are self driven.

1307 2018-08-20 21:15:33 The reason for this US sanction is to control the oil market.
1308 2018-08-20 21:15:31 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
1309 2018-08-20 21:15:31 Be sure to avoid the @jiffylube  on 114 in Peabody MA. The customer service is atrocious and they are more concerned with their overpriced oil changes than providing a safe and comfortable experience for customers. #CustomerService
1310 2018-08-20 21:15:21 I can't retweet your tweets. What's happening?
1311 2018-08-20 21:15:19 Is it like real garlic and not in salty oil?
1312 2018-08-20 21:15:12 And yeah just reduce salt and oil intake and you should be all good, says the hypocrite who fried everything in site today. I need to get a grip, don't even drink water anymore? ._.

1314 2018-08-20 21:15:04 It’s really rude of them to put an oil change place right next door to Taco Bell bc now I want Taco Bell 
1315 2018-08-20 21:15:03 america had nothing with this socialist disaster... besides not buying their oil beacause saudies sell it cheaper
1316 2018-08-20 21:14:56 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating doughnut instead of rubbing the oil on his head
1317 2018-08-20 21:14:55 Funny the only ones liberals are interested in partnering with are the oil companies to bail them out, subsidizing and buy pipelines from them. Still waiting on real action on climate change but pretty sure ill be old and grey before liberals get to it.
1318 2018-08-20 21:14:55 Need an oil change but I'm too lazy too take it 
1319 2018-08-20 21:14:53 It’s time to get all the illegals out of the oil field in North Dakota
1320 2018-08-20 21:14:44 Savak was a myth too I hear. 

Shah never received US/UK military or financial support to stay in power.

Iran has been free to trade oil as a sovereign nation always.

Wow, what BS..

In reality Iranians had enough of Shah, doesn't mean they like the current politics
1321 2018-08-20 21:14:42 Let's praise a corrupt leader of a worthless organization.. remember oil for food or the rampant sexual harassment during his reign and don't forget he did Nothing to stop the genocide in Rwanda..
1322 2018-08-20 21:14:39 The drive from East Texas to West Texas is so looonnngggg and boring. pretty much depressing.. you go from seeing big beautiful pine trees and fresh cut grass to DIRT, flat plains with the smell of oil in the air! I'll be back soon  ETX
1323 2018-08-20 21:14:26 This would be funnier if he drove a truck that leaked oil, and painted an M under the leaking spot.
1324 2018-08-20 21:14:23 th
That's how u make ur rice? I fry it in a spoonful of oil and then put the water in
1325 2018-08-20 21:14:23 Btw - DATA - according to @TheEconomist is becoming more valuable than oil
1326 2018-08-20 21:14:08 @MadMoneyOnCNBC hey Jim - if you had to add an oil stock to your portfolio - how would you rank BP, MPC, and CVX
1327 2018-08-20 21:14:08 I think you should challenge her to a nude hot oil wrestling match, winner take's the name. Please don't forget to video it. 
1328 2018-08-20 21:14:01 Stat that means absolutely zero. ZERO. Colts take 1-0 record into game w/Ravens at Lucas Oil. Last time they opened a preseason 2-0?

(tick, tick, tick)

Ted Marchibroda's boys in 1994. Actually finished 4-0. Finished reg season 8-8.
1329 2018-08-20 21:13:54 Dropped my car off at 9:30AM for an oil change and I can't leave work b/c it's not ready yet :(
1330 2018-08-20 21:13:48 And the oil I picked is red apple pie with caramel and whipped cream 
1331 2018-08-20 21:13:44 Watching The-rump at ceremony for ICE. Utter embarrassment. Non-stop bullshit.

Another word for "bullshit" is "lie." "Bullshit" is defined broadly (e.g.,"lie" to "joke"). Maybe he'll fall back on: he is bullshit artist, not liar.

Fucking snake oil salesman.

1336 2018-08-20 21:13:11 Yeah or scomo I know Him  personally he is an snake swimming in olive oil. Remember his greatest achievement before going into Parliment was “where the blodsybhell are you” god help us - I just wish the libs had some balls
1337 2018-08-20 21:13:08 Your Indianapolis @Colts are back in action tonight during a preseason game versus the Baltimore @Ravens at 8 p.m.  We're conveniently steps away from Lucas Oil Stadium.
1338 2018-08-20 21:12:54 Hahahah this is incredible.

'P lastic fans who will disappear if the oil goes' is my personal favourite.
1339 2018-08-20 21:12:43 With the voodonomics we run in Nigeria I think we don't even know  how much bpd of oil we extract then add the bunkering and underrcovery as well. It is the crumbs we see. Sure @Puckish_Henry agrees @LagosTalks913
1340 2018-08-20 21:12:40 THERE ARE 18 DAYS UNTIL THE OIL BARREL COMES HOME #WaiteFootball #BeatClay
1341 2018-08-20 21:12:34 I just did. It’s called “Oil changers” and it’s on mission lol
1342 2018-08-20 21:12:33 I see nothing in the Bible says rapture,the dead shall rise first,then we meet them in the clouds  Prophecy has come to pass Jesus. Is coming soon,I feel it in my spirt,we don't know the date or hour,oil full, looking up, everyday expect his return

1345 2018-08-20 21:12:00 I’ll say it every time, @ElsaJeanxxx is smoking fucking hot. But oil/lube just ups the ante  one million fold
1346 2018-08-20 21:12:00 The path for oil is, and always will be, full of blood I’m afraid. Take time to embrace humanity in our time of greed. This will help minimize images etched into our souls. I can’t unsee the bomb which struck an innocent group of children on a school bus in Yemen. #ReThinkPeace
1347 2018-08-20 21:11:59 Went and got my oil changed today and one of the guys asked me if my mama used to be a principal at Mauldin and y’all I almost cried #haventheardthatinyears #itsgoodtobehome
1348 2018-08-20 21:11:42 Now I gotta do my oil change in this heat 
1349 2018-08-20 21:11:41 my car only takes synthetic oil.. so now my oil changes are 59.99$ + tax  can I have my old car back?
1350 2018-08-20 21:11:40 Looks like there's a consensus that the almighty, Ubiquitous KSA is always there to simply solve any imaginable oil supply difficulty.
1351 2018-08-20 21:11:34 Melissa, also known as Lemon Balm is very useful to calm, relax and reduce anxiety.
It can be taken as a tea or tincture or the essential oil can be used in an uplifting hand cream
1352 2018-08-20 21:11:34 Buying groups are never cheaper on oil.

Also, look up Keeping Up Appearances, what world have you been living on? just another example of remainers on Twitter being out of touch.
1353 2018-08-20 21:11:31 #Obama oversaw Flint MI drinking water contamination, expanded offshore drilling, mishandled the Deepwater Horizon disaster and OKed oil pipelines totaling way more than the Keystone project. Where the hell was your write up during those past 8 years?
1354 2018-08-20 21:11:28 DONALD, as I've mentioned in some of My previous tweets, Saving Time and Energy is an Essential Principle. WE assume Venezuela a Strategic Interest and a Future Strategic Partner to the U.S. (Oil Reserves, a Future Anti - Terrorism Ally). WE assume and advise that ...

1359 2018-08-20 21:10:50 Add a little salt to the oil. Issa jam 
1360 2018-08-20 21:10:46 The chicken was quite moist, but I did take each bit out the marinade and let the excess drip off before throwing it in the flour. No idea other than that, I don’t have a fryer, so it’s just oil in a pan on the big hob turned up to about a quarter
1361 2018-08-20 21:10:39 The hair oil is magic. I love that stuff.
1362 2018-08-20 21:10:31 Getting my oil changed and the counter guy scratched his head and proceeded to sniff his fingers. 

Men really are the superior race I tell ya.
1363 2018-08-20 21:10:25 I am expecting to meet with Zaza soon, he hasn’t been in town, am promised a meeting soon.

1366 2018-08-20 21:10:16 That's great raise the minimum wage, causing businesses to either raise prices or lay of staff ultimately doing no benefit, but some damage to the economy. I thought you were supposed to be for the people not selling us snake oil that actually poisons us.
1367 2018-08-20 21:10:12 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this August? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
1368 2018-08-20 21:10:10 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1369 2018-08-20 21:10:07 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1370 2018-08-20 21:09:50 I mean Argan oil does, that’s the only place in the world that successfully grows argan trees
1371 2018-08-20 21:09:50 Do all the right wing taking heads sell snake oil?
1372 2018-08-20 21:09:27 You should thank them. Your head-in-the-sand approach to climate change and oil-industry-stooge votes have made their jobs harder and endangered them with longer, hotter, drier fire seasons.

1376 2018-08-20 21:08:48 2 So the deciples of Christ anointed the sick in the tabernackles as Jesus told them to with the Holy oil.

1573 2018-08-20 20:42:40 A field decline rate of about 4.5 percent a year is commonly used for existing oil production. If we apply that decline rate to current world production of ~100mm BOPD, you can see we need to find 4.5mm BOPD of new production just to stay even

1603 2018-08-20 20:38:23 Brent oil futures are hovering just above the 200-day moving average, which forms a bit of a resistance preventing oil prices from crashing lower. The flip side of that is that if Brent does drop below that threshold, sellers could push prices much lower

1649 2018-08-20 20:33:04 Well, they have the perfect audience: clueless, ignorant people who can't distinguish truth from snake oil.
1650 2018-08-20 20:32:59 The @wsj has to get paid and the oil industry has tons of money to throw their way. #tesla has no money for them not even to advertise. But consumers vote with their wallets. The tides are soon changing.
1651 2018-08-20 20:32:44 By the way, the oil sector in Venezuela (100% gov’t owned) accounts for 75% of GDP, so what we you saying, exactly?
1652 2018-08-20 20:32:44 If all Greenpeacers stopped using oil products for good we might begin to take you seriously. If...
1653 2018-08-20 20:32:41 “Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.”
Proverbs 21:17 NIV 
1654 2018-08-20 20:32:37 Oh God!!!! I don't buy facial stuff. Just wash my face at night and use cream and coconut oil. Maybe that's why my face looks horrible 
1655 2018-08-20 20:32:37 You mean olive oil ,
1656 2018-08-20 20:32:29 Cut off their oil and lng and that will stop overnight!
1657 2018-08-20 20:32:22 I just put it in water, freeze it and then pop the ice cube into whatever I’m making. Not a fan of dried basil. I’ve tried oil but it didn’t work well for me anyway. I’ve also made pesto and frozen cubes to use later. I freeze, then store bags of the frozen cubes in the freezer.
1658 2018-08-20 20:32:21 With a huge boat and three decks, one door and one window would have meant at least two of the decks were in complete darkness. So you'd have eight people 24/7  not feeding and caring for animals, but filling oil lamps so they could see !!

1659 2018-08-20 20:32:18 So I need an oil change and I’m thinking about doing it myself this time and going full synthetic 
1660 2018-08-20 20:31:58 @IQuitSmoking_1 Thanks for sharing! Coconut oil is such an interesting topic these days.
1661 2018-08-20 20:31:48 I dunno about that- I really love a fresh garden tomato and cucumber salad with lemon, olive oil and salt and pepper or avocado and tomatoes on some cottage cheese  (tomato is technically a fruit yes I know)
1662 2018-08-20 20:31:41 It won’t be there much longer w/oil drilling or climate change or if your president hands the whole thing back to Putrid. So, you know, enjoy
1663 2018-08-20 20:31:33 Harvard University study says #coconut oil is "pure poison" for consumption. Who consume coconut oil? It's good as a lubricant for skin and hair conditioning.
1664 2018-08-20 20:31:32 Maybe because other provinces like Saskatchewan have had the same increase in oil prices and their economies are still in the toilet. Why is that? Also, you seem to expect them to accomplish miracles in 3 years. Change takes some time.
1665 2018-08-20 20:31:18 @_ImperatorRex_ can we do the same as this for our military and oil companies? @ThomasWictor @BreitbartNews #MondayMotivation

1670 2018-08-20 20:30:58 The hamburger ( if onions are sautéed in peanut oil) is the most complete meal . It has something from every section of the food pyramid-remember tomatoes are a fruit not vegetable. You grill the patty, what could be healthier??
1671 2018-08-20 20:30:48 oil pull to pull out the toxins in you
1672 2018-08-20 20:30:46 i just found out y'all have been eating coconut oil and I'm SO. CONFUSED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING PEOPLE????
1673 2018-08-20 20:30:38 I did! They are a mix of beeswax and coconut oil.
1674 2018-08-20 20:30:34 Calentita’s more difficult to explain lol its made with chickpea flour, olive oil, salt pepper & water, other recipes vary as some have eggs in it, baked in the oven & eaten cold even though its called Calentita, which is hot in spanish. Confusing, I know lol

1677 2018-08-20 20:30:05 I look a mess and mfs at the dealership gassing me so I can get more than an oil change
1678 2018-08-20 20:29:59 Russia's decision to move most of their factories to the Urals was also a good call. If they hadn't then most of their industry would've been swept away on the first few months of barbarossa. And yeah taking the Caucasus would've been great for that sweet sweet oil xD

6. Wash your face and neck with warm water and an oil free cleanser to remove makeup.
1682 2018-08-20 20:29:45 I hope you realize that once there is an oil spill, there will be no more surfing here.  Thoughts @cathmckenna? How is a pipeline climate leadership?
1683 2018-08-20 20:29:29 The bulldog beard oil & balm I have got is quite good. I like the scent too. Lasts 8-10 hrs

Works quite well after blow drying to moisturise. Better than others do at that point that's for sure.
1684 2018-08-20 20:29:25 At this time of year, roasted or grilled vegetables are a good choice. Cut them up, olive oil, salt, pepper, and cook them, and optionally add cheese. Alternately panzanella - toast some good bread and cut it and some tomatoes into chunks add basil, salt, pepper and cheese.

1690 2018-08-20 20:28:55 But I’m glad you are able to not take that route. I’m trying to stay away from it. The last two times I’ve gotten it, I reacted badly. My hands felt like they caught on fire and I cried the first night. I literally dipped my hands in almond and coconut oil, which helped a lot.
1691 2018-08-20 20:28:47 Sir how many armies in the world are running fertiliser, banking, cement, housing (DHA), SCO, FWO, NLC, FOTCO, AWT, FCO (now oil sector) any many other commercial entities?

1694 2018-08-20 20:28:25 I knew you would, because you're a good girl
1695 2018-08-20 20:27:58 I use CBD oil, it helps some. My dog also has benefited from it!
1696 2018-08-20 20:27:38 Some German scientists is going off about how bad coconut oil is so bad for you. 

But he’s talking about consuming it. I’m still gonna use it to make my skin and hair glow tho.
1697 2018-08-20 20:27:36 I’ve had a job since I was 15 (currently have 2) and pay for my gas, oil changes, and such... my sister just got her first job this summer at 17 and still uses my parents cards to fill her tank and gets her oil changes and such paid for :) :) :)
1698 2018-08-20 20:27:29 I am literally covered to my elbows in grease and oil, never say the safety intern does nothing 
1699 2018-08-20 20:27:15 I would *never* put raisins in potato salad. Vinegar, oil, Dusseldorf mustard, celery leaf, cracked peppercorns, and bacon bits, yes, but never raisins (those go in the carrot slaw).
1700 2018-08-20 20:27:15 I saw a computer simulation done by the RAND Corporation in 1970, (if I am correct), according to the simulation, the World should have run out of crude oil reserves and food by now.

This is why all these future projections are really a fool's errand.
1701 2018-08-20 20:26:55 Fracking for natural gas. Not oil
1702 2018-08-20 20:26:53 You can see how distorted @hrw for their selective call on justice. Human rights violations are all over Ethiopia not in Somali region only. This shows how these institutions are driven and influenced by Western interests. Where there's oil there are a lot of sniffing dogs!
1703 2018-08-20 20:26:52 Tesla will either go bust or become a niche manufacturer or be rescued by an oil country.  Other car companies know what their target price is (Tesla) and they will produce better products.  Tesla will go bust.

1705 2018-08-20 20:26:45 Using baby oil to take eyelashes off rather than the awful eyelash remover that feels like it’s burning your eyes is sooooo much better
1706 2018-08-20 20:26:42 Agree on all fronts there....meant to ask you. Gotta know the Oilers are gonna rush Bouchard. Its what they do. You saw him as much as anybody. Is he NHL ready in your opinion? I hope so because the Oil will rush him whether he is or not.

and even then I say struggle but really it just means I'm below 3k
1709 2018-08-20 20:26:37 Am telling you! Oil wells everywhere and there are still poor people in Nigeria
1710 2018-08-20 20:26:34 Could have done the oil change on your own
1711 2018-08-20 20:26:32 You didn’t oil ya titties just to say that ok lol you look good as fuck and that’s ok lol
1712 2018-08-20 20:26:24 The consumer products division makes all of the money (selling cbd oil). There is no revenue from patent applications? So what's the big deal? Knock a stock down 70% in a day over that?
1713 2018-08-20 20:26:22 No me había emocionado BoxyLuxe hasta que vi el SDJ Glow Oil... now I need it in ma’ life 
1714 2018-08-20 20:26:13 Good work Paddy. A friend who was in the RAF was told by a commanding officer, who he'd never seen before, at a briefing 'Iraq was all about oil. We're going after Russia next then we'll be going after China'.

1717 2018-08-20 20:26:04 The recent news of the huge #EXXON oil discovery in Pakistan bigger than Kuwaiti oil reserves is an absolute lie. 

I found out today after a week of digging up the facts. 

Exxon owns no ONSHORE Block in Pakistan which it can drill for discovery. PERIOD. What to talk of oil.

1719 2018-08-20 20:25:49 Should I buy those 3 products and the castor oil
1720 2018-08-20 20:25:43 That's like looking at the weather forecast for next weekend and asking me if it's wrong. GERS is an estimate, so unless you have the actual data it can't be proven right or wrong. 

No, a deficit can be caused by a fall in revenue or an increase in spending. Remember oil crash?
1721 2018-08-20 20:25:31 "I don't want to be high" is a common statement in regards to cannabis oil treatments.  
Would you rather be low? You don't like to be happy?  Being high is a term to describe a euphoric feeling. Why the hell would you fear a euphoric feeling?
1722 2018-08-20 20:25:29 Tonight is @CORTRoad at Lucas Oil Raceway Park. Hoping to do well, as I am still in striking distance of the points race.
1723 2018-08-20 20:25:22 I think it's time for Andrew Sheer to support conservatives with a clear platform (lower taxes, few regulations, support for oil & gas industry, smaller government, balanced budget, end to supply management, etc.).
1724 2018-08-20 20:25:17 Love God and drink water and use Coconut oil 
1725 2018-08-20 20:25:08 Off work today. Too much stuff to do. Oil change right now.
1726 2018-08-20 20:25:02 Stunning image! Since 1958 you create works using oil barrels which proved to be such a suitable working material because of their sculptural effect and their low cost, and they soon became a dominant factor in your work. Cannot wait to see “Mastaba”. Christo, you are my hero!
1727 2018-08-20 20:25:00 They always charge pretty boys a lot more for oil changes...

1735 2018-08-20 20:23:25 I saw this a few years ago in Morocco.  The goats are eating argon seeds, which their stomach acid removes the hard outer kernel, leaving it easier to extract the famous argon oil from the inner kernel.  WCC may need them to eat poison ivy, but in Morocco they digest seeds.
1736 2018-08-20 20:23:07 Patriots and Trump supporters are like oil and water. If you love the USA, you know Trump is compromised and want him gone. 

If your only goal in your impotent life is “owning the libs” then Peters definitely will make you uncomfortable.

1738 2018-08-20 20:22:34 just dropped off engine oil with nearly 12k miles on it. lets see how good it held up! #amsoil
1739 2018-08-20 20:22:17 I use it to take my make up off but I like to second cleanse to make sure all the oil, suncream and any make up residue is gone. Looking forward to your post as always!

1744 2018-08-20 20:21:47 Some countries like Saudi Arabia that have such good BOT have seen that their economies are structurally deficient due to its consumer status and overdependence on crude sales

As is evident recently, you can see that it's trying seriously to diversify. A fall in oil jolts them
1745 2018-08-20 20:21:33 It's harsh but necessary to say this to you, Socialism doesn't work. Not even whey you have the largest reserves of oil/gas available to you.

I ended up talking to my vet about it (my dog also has severe anxiety) and it does sound worth looking into, for her at least.
1753 2018-08-20 20:20:37 I'd rather be boiled in oil.

1761 2018-08-20 20:19:50 I’m a little late to twitter for a Monday. Got in a good sweat this morn, @NaturesUltra  lime and Solace Roll On CBD oil, glass of kombucha and cup of .ove my routine. #MondayMotivaton #CBDlife #healthy #natural #myanchor #routine #FeelingGood #letsgo #TakeNote
1762 2018-08-20 20:19:50 Dawn. They use that stuff to clean the animals at oil spills.
1763 2018-08-20 20:19:48 Very interesting today that your vet recommended #CBD oil for our ailing dog.  Apparently, for dogs with his condition, it works wonders. Can't wait to get some and see how he reacts.
1764 2018-08-20 20:19:44 I'm German and my mother made it with mayonnaise - depends on the  region you're living is, wether you use it or make a version with vinegar and oil. Most important in "my" version: boiled eggs and pickled cucumber with its juice. No onios - they would make left overs turn bitter
1765 2018-08-20 20:19:43 It’s an oil “facial” that everyone raves about because it’s resurfacing, tones and clarifies the skin. It’s supposed to be amazing but also $80 lol
1766 2018-08-20 20:19:31 Is coconut oil good for the hair?
1767 2018-08-20 20:19:30 Just the look of all that oil is unsatisfying
1768 2018-08-20 20:19:26 Bar of anti bacterial soap literally just swirl the brush round on the bar & massage the soap through the bristles then rinse and repeat. For sponge mix any oil with fairy liquid, soak & massage the sponge till it loses its shape and then rinse it out it’ll dry back to normal
1769 2018-08-20 20:19:19 It’s gonna take the dealership an hour and a half to do my oil and it’s probably my fault since last time I was here with an appointment, they decided to not put me in the system, then I may have had a problem with the guy kinda giving me a “not my problem” attitude.

1775 2018-08-20 20:18:41 Ok just asked the sister: 
1. don't sleep in makeup. wasn't obvi to me
2. makeup remover wipes are ok, but harsh on the skin. try coconut oil
3. don't feel pressured to buy everything. keeping it simple is easier and cheaper.

1778 2018-08-20 20:18:18 I recently invested in getting CBD oil and I take it in the morning and night. No more depression/mood swings, and less cramps. I recommend it. It’s really changed the way I feel everyday 100%

1784 2018-08-20 20:17:35 The Vault is basically a glorified basement. It's at the bottom of The Capitol. Time Lords get their marijuana from the Outsiders there. Those with clearance work inside. They're experimenting making wax and oil. Too much THC simply is not enough. We say Kudos
1785 2018-08-20 20:17:33 Confia.oil
1786 2018-08-20 20:17:24 Remember that the economy is largely diversified. It is the govt revenues that are not diversified. Bcoz we don't want govt participation in enterprise, govt needs to make more money in non oil. Because govt is not a player, we need more citizens to play, with govt protection.
1787 2018-08-20 20:17:13 looks like the coconut oil is treating the beard well. i just bought some
1788 2018-08-20 20:16:58 Lol you no make wild. You give it back to them and tell them politely that kelewele is supposed to be spiced. They will probably spit on your food but hot oil will kill the bacteria.
1789 2018-08-20 20:16:43 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.

1794 2018-08-20 20:15:55 Leftists that constantly complain about oil companies need to:

A. Take their gas powered car to the junkyard and have it crushed. 

Or

B. Ride their bikes or walk to wherever they're going.
1795 2018-08-20 20:15:53 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

1797 2018-08-20 20:15:43 Absolutely- you keep all that lovely wonga- we’ll keep our oil, electricity, & whisky bond- oh & Gas. Sound ok to you... Deal!
1798 2018-08-20 20:15:36 Anoche fui a la oil ilusionada con la pizza y fue la pizza mas fea de mi vida y fue peor por que era post boliche. Me rompieron el corazón.
1799 2018-08-20 20:15:32 Next time Robin say, "Yes mate, what's the make and model?.....OK, will you want the oil changing?......Oh, you'd like to know how long it's going to take? Forever mate.  See you on Monday morning then?" Put the phone down.
1800 2018-08-20 20:15:30 I really like CBC.  They have some great news reporting.  When in Canada I watch and see better news coverage of us than when I am here in the USA. They did a reveal on Lindane and canola oil some years ago and it was never reported in the USA.  I still won't buy canola, ever.
1801 2018-08-20 20:15:29 Relistening to some old @nosuchthing podcasts, do we know if @CoreyTaylorRock ever managed to record any vocals in the Inchindown oil tanks? 

I'd give my giant squid penis to hear them

@Schreiberland @JamesHarkin @andrewhunterm
1802 2018-08-20 20:15:08 He got a nice body but the face needs coconut oil.
1803 2018-08-20 20:15:08 Venezuela’s current condition is just because of socialism.  Not the crippling US sanctions or the price of oil.  Just socialism
1804 2018-08-20 20:15:03 And how many inches of pipeline has the private sector produced under Trudeau. That would be in the negatives as they have screwed up so bad nobody will invest in Canada’s oil and the only willing party flees due to liberal incompetence! Liberal retardation at its finest
1805 2018-08-20 20:14:58 Dump baby oil in a spray bottle.
1806 2018-08-20 20:14:52 Seems a little misleading

Is it fair to calculate % water used per well. Horizontal drilling allows for much more efficient  production from each well.

Hence you'll produce more oil but also use more water per well

Why not use water used per barrel of oil produced?
1807 2018-08-20 20:14:41 i personally like using facetune until i look like i'm slathered in baby oil

1809 2018-08-20 20:14:28 Man yes. Mine doubles as a pressure cooker, so I’ll just throw like 4-6 frozen pieces of chicken in there with some water, herbs and spices, vinegar, canola oil, & a lil bit a soy sauce. Leave it in while I go to work, and come back to some chicken that falls apart.
1810 2018-08-20 20:14:01 このゲームそんなんばっかだよ！！
1811 2018-08-20 20:13:58 what oil did you use? sesame oil with a little bit of crispy chive garnish at the end is amazing
1812 2018-08-20 20:13:55 What is wrong with dumb swampies, why the fuck cant they learn a beat & play a proper drum rhythm, honestly, its not that hard! Next time just bang out - "ba- na-na cake -- put-it-in-the-oven - now" I don't know what's more offensive, the oil using nimby hypocrisy or the bad ear!

1821 2018-08-20 20:13:00 The reason I posted all those Portocarrera’s, besides the fact that they’re wonderful and largely unknown, is that I own an oil painting by him called “Black Madonna” that my father bought at auction back in 1966! And it’s large! 2’x3’!

1825 2018-08-20 20:12:42 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
1826 2018-08-20 20:12:35 Things to do today:
Change my oil.
Change my brakes & rotors.

1837 2018-08-20 20:11:36 Don’t recall the conservatives buying a pipeline? But the alt left has ensured nobody will invest in our oil. Due to utter incompetence from the alt left we are now owners of a sixty year old leaky pipeline! Liberal retardation at its finest!
1838 2018-08-20 20:11:18 I eat sweet potatos once a week as my treat so I'm going to eat them the way I like them, which is sautéed in coconut oil.  I'd rather do without if I had to boil them.

1843 2018-08-20 20:10:54 Cool  The damn desert will finally get some water. Actually there should be a spate of floods for about 150 years..then a century later..some vegetation will begin to grow. There'll be water ..not just oil in the ground. It'll be good.
1844 2018-08-20 20:10:49 To the SW Airline workers at LAX who went into my check-in bag and rifled through my stuff and stole me weed oil cartridges and shoes, I hope your commute home is filled with horror and terror.

1851 2018-08-20 20:10:08 Why is Trump keeping US SOLDIERS in IRAQ? America have already raided the oil, Gold, resources! They’ve even put a puppet in power!

1858 2018-08-20 20:09:44 Some of the materials arriving from UCP nomination hopefuls are "interesting". We don't need to "restore the AB dream", we need to face reality.

1859 2018-08-20 20:09:32 Gravy looks like crude oil lmao
1860 2018-08-20 20:09:32 But our oil bought from other countries don’t have to meet these ridiculous standards! Almost as if they want all oil production stopped in Canada!
1861 2018-08-20 20:09:30 They’re the modern version of snake oil salesmen, only they probably put more effort in what they did back in the day

However simplistic fighting games always have my heart 

Course I once wanted to create an RPG Fighter

Course trying to combine those two genres of games is like oil and water.
1876 2018-08-20 20:07:35 The problems of low and medium added value manufacturing in the North and West (the South Wales Valleys are in this) have much more to do with the UK's time as an oil producer, still do even if we no longer have net exports than with the EU.
1877 2018-08-20 20:07:25 Went to my aunts house later to thank her for the birthday money she sent me and 4 hours later I showed her how to use all of her technology and ordered CBD oil for her inflammation
1878 2018-08-20 20:07:16 tons of them complain about having no oil too like Jesus Christ I'm surrounded by kuso ttks
1879 2018-08-20 20:07:06 Have you heard of the ‘oil cleansing method’ It is all I will use on my face & I love it though it takes some tries to get the right mix for your skin. Zero chance for racial insensitivity issues tho! ;-)
1880 2018-08-20 20:06:50 My dog stepped in my BLACK oil paint... So now little tobie paw prints all over the carpet
1881 2018-08-20 20:06:49 I cannot for the life of me find the tweet by Foone about how it's weird that we know the names of the owners of the largest oil companies but we act like we have no idea whose fault global warming is.
1882 2018-08-20 20:06:45 You act as if liberals and ndp actually achieved anything. They bought the pipeline due to utter incompetence. Right wing worked to get the private sector to build pipelines and achieved it. Alt left can’t get anyone in the world to invest in our oil. Liberal incompetence!
1883 2018-08-20 20:06:01 Wowwww this black seed oil really work
1884 2018-08-20 20:05:58 Good idea. Also tell senate to stop the poison on the fields. It's also killing. And save your oil platforms better.
1885 2018-08-20 20:05:58 Everytime I turn around I gotta spend money wtf is a $50 oil change

See what I did there 
1889 2018-08-20 20:05:31 A living, breathing example of SOCIALISM. Just as Maggie Thatcher cited, eventually you run out of other people's money. The oil money is gone & people are eating their pets. What a wonderful life (not).

1891 2018-08-20 20:05:05 My issue is when  EV demand becomes a mass produced every guy car, there are many car makers. I like it as a high end niche Porsche, Lamborghini type product with focus on performance and luxury. Let someone else build the volkswagens
1892 2018-08-20 20:05:03 Of course, there is some misleading info. No, there was no miracle under chavez. The subsidies were, in part, funded with private property wrongfully expropriated. More than half of the oil revenues (in the +100$ a barrel days) was robbed. We were struggling bad as early as 2010.
1893 2018-08-20 20:05:02 Utter tosh. It wasn't necessary. Blair could've said 'No George'. The war wasn't about WMDs it was about the capture of oil and to cause the unrest still happening now in the middle east. Guns bombs planes is money. Fuck who gets killed..

1900 2018-08-20 20:03:56 I sure don't feel like I am right now. Have to put essential oil bottles in smth like Xmas baubles between two crumpled gold papers so that it doesn't rattle. And you succeed.

After 6th time maybe
1901 2018-08-20 20:03:46 Will God forgive you like this? N I passed there to see my tailor at dopemu
1902 2018-08-20 20:03:44 I’m aware but yo, that’s a lot of oil. I didn’t realize deep frying would need that much oil.
1903 2018-08-20 20:03:23 You don’t care about #Venezuela you care about their oil and the fact they won’t give the US any and you need to to come up with an excuse to keep bashing them lucky for you they have a dictator!
1904 2018-08-20 20:03:19 Psychology is not a science. It is nothing more than snake oil for the masses.
1905 2018-08-20 20:03:11 But Scotland wouldn't be paying for Trident,HS2,Nuclear Power stations etc.Englands GDP wouldn't benefit from whisky,salmon,energy ,water sales etc.Oil is only circa15% of Scotlands GDP.If we're so dependent on England,why do you fight so hard to keep us?.
1906 2018-08-20 20:02:29 I’m feeling real nervous rn so my mom is like “let’s soothe you by rubbing lavender essential oil on your wrists” and wow that’s really a white mom thing to do
1907 2018-08-20 20:02:17 Tonight's my first game ever working at Lucas Oil Stadium. Of all the times I've eaten pizza in my life, tell me why today was the first day I've accidentally flung a slice onto my shirt.
1908 2018-08-20 20:02:13 Same to people with whom I share a lap pool. A passing oil slick of fragrance makes breathing difficult. Wash it off before getting in.

1912 2018-08-20 20:01:50 shea moisture is always your best bet in my opinion. I have some smaller brands i support but shea is a good starting point. the low porosity one is great for me and so is the raw shea butter and the jamaican castor oil one
1913 2018-08-20 20:01:42 they took oil so expect the same for water
1914 2018-08-20 20:01:21 Why? Surely Trump will consider an] $ offer for Alaska in return for personal oil rights.
1915 2018-08-20 20:01:12 I would argue that 2011 was more about Europe contagion and 2015 was more about oil and recession fears. 2018 is mainly about rising rates (due to strong US growth) and a rising USD.
1916 2018-08-20 20:00:50 Thanks for the call today. Quick question and forgive me if you mentioned this but I assume you are short oil?  Yvonne
1917 2018-08-20 20:00:39 Not so Hellmanns! Maybe 15 years plus ago they changed the recipe. One of your marketing people even admitted to the change in oil. I too hate the plastic jars. Remove the mayo to glass as soon as it comes into my house. Marilynn has it right.

1923 2018-08-20 19:59:42 A TRUE popcorn lover, none of that microwave junk.  Thanks for the tip, I have coconut oil I use of cakes and such, never thought to use for popcorn, will try it.  And a Lady friend got me into natural sea salt.  I do use Kosher salt, but sea salt is the BOMB!
1924 2018-08-20 19:59:35 well i didn't go out for weeks so I ate homemade food with salad always but without much oil and I always drunk 2 glasses of water before every meal also I did 50 crunches whenever i felt like it and drink water first thing in the morning and before going to bed to increase your
1925 2018-08-20 19:59:28 Venezuela wants to nationalize their oil and the multi national corporations can't allow that. So we are destroying their economy until they give in and then yelling about how socialism doesn't work. This was true with Iran and Libya too.
1926 2018-08-20 19:59:23 Finally getting that oil change my car needed 5000 miles ago
1927 2018-08-20 19:59:13 Got my oil changed car inspection at lunch and renewed registration online so easy
1928 2018-08-20 19:59:11 Yep. Also, a huge amount of veg....every dish has been loaded with it, plus plenty of oil. It must play HAVOC with all the Italian's digestion...  Also, they are three dishes in and it's the first dish to feature ANY meat (and even that is fish)
1929 2018-08-20 19:59:10 baby oil is the biggest blessing in my life atm. Am so smooth. Am a smooth lubed up dolphin
1930 2018-08-20 19:58:52 Your skin produces more oil to compensate if you're scrubbing it away. You scrub the parts of your body that trap moisture to prevent bacteria from growing (causing the smelliness), but the rest should only see soap when it's dirty. Soap is harsh on skin.
1931 2018-08-20 19:58:41 I agree it will take a very long time to replace oil as a fuel for vehicles -- but we can make a huge dent in that quickly by supporting investment in electric car (or hydrogen -- just read of great advance in AUS) infrastructure, which would be supported by clean energy.
1932 2018-08-20 19:58:34 "... oil can ..."
1933 2018-08-20 19:58:32 Found alone near palm oil plantation.  Sadly not surprised.  Palm oil is the leading reason Orangutans are dying.   

Palm oil is not worth their lives.  Don't buy things with palm oil.
1934 2018-08-20 19:58:31 Preach it sister. We have it too. Calamine does help. Cool baths seem to help also. I am trying coconut oil on hands and face. I give it a solid “meh”

1941 2018-08-20 19:57:51 I'd have nasty sex with my looksmatch. Aka, twin flame. And by nasty sex I mean grey tantra, aromatherapy, vegan fruits, pure water, candles, sesame oil and relaxation music.
1942 2018-08-20 19:57:24 This quote from Rudy, is a clear indication that the man is smoking meth from an oil pipe or more than likely crack. No, sane human being thinks like this...
1943 2018-08-20 19:57:23 Also, if you use my products (oil) the recommended dosage is twice a day.  I haven’t ever seen anything about figuring out the dosage by body weight.  I’m not much help on that part, huh?

1946 2018-08-20 19:56:32 Scottish mackerel, with salt, pepper, a few Moroccan spices and of course lemon. Asparagus cooked in garlic and lemon, and below that a salad with quite a simple olive oil and balsamic dressing.
1947 2018-08-20 19:56:23 if oil prices go back up it will hardly matter. production is at 1947 levels. PDVSA has been purged of all real oil experts and replaced with political hacks.
1948 2018-08-20 19:56:16 And in other horrifying news, apparently coconut oil ain't that great for you. As in lard is slightly better, all things considered
1949 2018-08-20 19:56:05 I said it before will say it again “Yes therefore we should have Askari cement, bank, Sona yuria, DHA, FWO, NLC, SCO, frontier oil company (latest) and what not”
1950 2018-08-20 19:56:01 I don't think you have an accurate idea of the scale of such an undertaking, nor an accurate understanding of the current limitations of those technologies. 

Also, you seem to be talking about replacing coal here, when the conversation was about oil & gas.

Progress is slow.
1951 2018-08-20 19:55:50 Unless a foreign oil company decides it wants another pipeline through unconsenting First Nations' land. Then there's suddenly magically lots of room and money.
1952 2018-08-20 19:55:37 Just finished emptying the oil in my car and replacing the oil low sensor replace the oil back in the car seems to be working in great condition will tell down the road LOL 
1953 2018-08-20 19:55:36 I googled it. Someone said "the thing that stings is an oil, so washing up liquid cuts through it and then you can neutralise what's left with a weak solution of bleach, then rinse your hands thoroughly. Works every time"

Does.

It.

1955 2018-08-20 19:55:18 I do not know much about vaping.  I do know that when you vape you will notice the effects quicker than with the oil, but they won’t last as long as with the oil.  The onset of action is quicker with vaping.  The effects last longer with oil.

1961 2018-08-20 19:54:35 Apparently, it's not just me. Others have the same thing in different areas. I should try calling my finishes supplier in Norwich and ask for 10 Ltrs of Danish oil on the promise that if it's any good I'll buy some in the future. I suspect the kindly old guy would tell me to FO.

1973 2018-08-20 19:52:48 coal mining gets a subsidy it's call the Oil Depletion Allowance and it cover most extraction industries (mining) and timber
1974 2018-08-20 19:52:45 Those who hype the politics of oil do not like it! 

Those who want to show that President Trump is succeeding against conventional wisdom do not like it.

1981 2018-08-20 19:51:40 When market logic trumps politics, this is what happens. Refineries need feedstock. They do not deal with politics. They deal with demand and supply, the United States has been importing Russian oil for years, as strange as this may seem in the current political situation.
1982 2018-08-20 19:51:26 When visiting an upstream or midstream Oil and Gas facility, it is often required. Because if that place is going to blow, who wants escapees backing up?
1983 2018-08-20 19:51:22 At what point will we start holding these murdering bastards to account? When the last millilitre of oil has been sucked out?

1992 2018-08-20 19:50:12 If you Google "palm oil", it can be listed on products in a number of ways (one is palmate). Rich corps. find a way to market so that while something is "legal", it's not necessarily  ethical. Sadly, money trumps scruples, ethics,  morals ...every inherent good quality.

2007 2018-08-20 19:48:31 Thanks.
Pakistan had lost its left wing in Dec 1971. So its people and leadership was afraid and anxious.
In the aftermath of Arab Israel war in 1973 & the oil shock, there was a surge of Islamic sentiment in the Muslim world. Bhutto thought to secure Pakistan by tapping into it.
2008 2018-08-20 19:47:55 Becauuuuusseeeee....no other place is more suicidal and interested in destroying themselves like the Middle East. Cut the funds and allow them grow a brain for sense. If you must stay, take the Oil to fund continued stay

2014 2018-08-20 19:46:35 If you have a vast resource worth money, then why not exploit it? That would bring money into the economy. Why is the country suffering financially while sitting on a vast resource? How the oil is controlled seems to be the problem, not the oil itself.

2019 2018-08-20 19:45:25 Correlation between Brent and WTI is retarded.

If WTI falls and Brent goes down with it. The implied logic would be global crude prices are falling because Padd2 cannot get its crude oil out, to where its needed.

2027 2018-08-20 19:44:53 The foolish decision not to devalue, cherry picking of what to finance at 199, reneging from ND Amnesty program (Which led to blowing up of pipelines by Tompolo ) and of course the low oil prices were all responsible for the recession IMO.

2049 2018-08-20 19:40:26 How is it Saudi Arabia remains a protected species? Appalling human rights record, complicit in 9/11 and many other international terrorist acts yet, somehow, stays under world radar. Might it be a three letter word starting with OIL?
2050 2018-08-20 19:40:18 DOE Offers 11M Bbl of SPR Sour Crude Oil for Delivery Oct.-Nov. in tender

2052 2018-08-20 19:40:11 I started using coconut oil to condition mine and it ruuuuuuules
2053 2018-08-20 19:40:05 Family Nutrition: #Cheeze-It this August? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
2054 2018-08-20 19:39:51 Looks like Alvis Grant was a career sign painter in Texas from the time he was 15 years old and lifelong handball player. He was a Marine in WWII. After retiring he focused on his oil paintings.
2055 2018-08-20 19:39:45 @LFC can never be compared to @ManUtd .We know football is evolving, but our best times under Ferguson was never about money. It was about management class and team determination. That’s what we lack now. The likes of @ManCity will always bank on oil money. United we stand 
2056 2018-08-20 19:39:39 At the CA Capitol right now, where the #BrownsLastChance campaign is about to turn it up on @Jerrybrowngov, who has ignored Californians living at the fenceline of the oil and gas industry. Follow @actdottv on Facebook for the livestream
2057 2018-08-20 19:39:30 What if I were to tell you that bagels are boiled in a pot of water and donuts are fried in a pot of oil and so they are really more similar than just the shape?
2058 2018-08-20 19:39:28 @shehusani is our choice.. will be our choice for the next election.. and he will forever be our choice if he wishes to continue..
2059 2018-08-20 19:39:27 Oil change on my lunch break horrible 
2060 2018-08-20 19:39:08 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
2061 2018-08-20 19:39:06 What is that oil is she using may its the one that makes here like that
2062 2018-08-20 19:39:01 The environment thing, the people thing, the EU brexit thing. Its the anti Agenda 21 narrative. Well let me explain. They already exist. And they are at war. You are dancing to the minion jig to the Murdoch oil deal. Your enforcing their agenda mate. Just like they want you to.
2063 2018-08-20 19:38:57 Did you get his winkle ?
Actually very powerful pictures.
2064 2018-08-20 19:38:33 That’s not exactly right. The overall economy depends too much on oil. It’s been a problem since it was privately owned, but fed gov intervention failed to provide any long term solutions.
2065 2018-08-20 19:38:24 i left warm olive oil & conditioner in my hair for 3 hours then washed it out and my hair feels so nice
2066 2018-08-20 19:38:22 Any oil paint cleaner should work. Try odorless paint thinner. Can get it at any art store.
2067 2018-08-20 19:38:20 Shidd i need to be asking oil money tra 
2068 2018-08-20 19:38:03 i hate all the effort that goes into having a car lol... like i don’t want to pull over to get gas, i don’t want to get the oil changed, i don’t want to buy new tires... dis tew much work
2069 2018-08-20 19:37:55 Pure slime. Like oil with delusions of grandeur. Trump is loathsome and little more then a con man. #kidnapper #conartist #impeachtrump NOW & #vote2018
2070 2018-08-20 19:37:33 Not only is @raisingsaddles fantastic at bike fixing, servicing and all round a good guy, MG can now add “domestic cleaning” to skills.  Oil pretty much out of carpet thanks to @muc_off degreaser! @lornavdk is now speaking to me again....!
2071 2018-08-20 19:37:32 Great, do you support banning them? Considering that you can forego their use with minimal affect on your life, whereas with oil and gas you can't without grinding modern civilization to a halt.
2072 2018-08-20 19:37:21 i might need some engine oil for lube
2073 2018-08-20 19:37:20 @JohnBrennan You poured your own castor oil.  Drink it, swirl it in your mouth, let it coat your tongue and teeth, then swallow it with a smile.
2074 2018-08-20 19:37:15 You are a big oil shill.  We all know that the only way Ewon can make money is to get the parts for free.  They should be HAPPY to go BK to save the planet.
2075 2018-08-20 19:36:59 Is that what Pruitt was doing at the EPA when he took orders from his oil bidness handlers?
2076 2018-08-20 19:36:53 Ah right?? Very useful to keep the oil out of the eyes.
2077 2018-08-20 19:36:40 From mi oil up e 30 any boi weh mi guffi, a 5 ina face suh mi rise up e duppy 
2078 2018-08-20 19:36:34 been thinking about getting and oil change since last week then randomly got a $25 off coupon in my email 
2079 2018-08-20 19:36:19 Oh BS. To make up for lost oil revenue, idiot Venezuelan central planners decided to print money for profit. Be it's called " seignorage " and no Govt is STUPID enough to try it on any signififant scale.... exept for Venezuela
2080 2018-08-20 19:36:03 Iran is dependent on the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), a government-owned corporation ranks as the world's second largest oil company, after Saudi Arabia's state-owned Aramco. Bring down value of oil, bring Iran down !
2081 2018-08-20 19:35:56 What science? That we don’t need oil / resources? 

You know most middle class Canadians rely on resource sector jobs for a living.
2082 2018-08-20 19:35:46 lauren ive got an oil painting natural immunity
2083 2018-08-20 19:35:44 Methane emissions are mostly contributed by livestock. Oil & gas contributes CO2 moreso than anything else. So ban livestock?

Once again, your implicit bias is on display. You're just spoiled. We need energy and economic movement to develop viable replacements for fossil fuels.
2084 2018-08-20 19:35:38 I have said it several times and i will repeat it.. A man who doesn't respect people right cannot be our representative in the upper chamber
2085 2018-08-20 19:35:33 I understand the budget agreement calls for 100 mln barrel liquidation of strategic oil reserves over the next decade
2086 2018-08-20 19:35:32 You're a racist & the type of person which keeps fascism alive. Above is a brief outline for how you, our government have financed & armed barbaric men to create war, rape, torture, kill, girls women & men. Millions slaughtered in lands of oil & Muslim. You have no care for women
2087 2018-08-20 19:35:29 vinegar's an acid too. oil and vinegar is what makes a vinaigrette, adding lemon juice is standard.
sounds really good
2088 2018-08-20 19:35:28 Looks like Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones have another thing in common being snake oil salesmen for fake supplements
2089 2018-08-20 19:35:20 Biggest opposition to Gst was from Modi.. Bjp wasted most of the time. In stalling the LS RS.. UPA did all its work in post 2008 recession, high crude oil & Iraq war period.. Modi has it relatively calmer & he killed it with Demonetisation and then GST (check d no f amendments)

2091 2018-08-20 19:34:54 that one at the front looks a bit dodgey.
2092 2018-08-20 19:34:37 i use organic shampoo and conditioner, i only shampoo every 3 days. i make sure they're sulfate free and i prefer castor oil in the ingredients
2093 2018-08-20 19:34:28 Well, it sounds like a good idea, but Congress needs to give the postal service money to do it.  We give billions of dollars to oil companies, no reason we can't give the postal service money. Instead of trying to destroy the postal service of the U.S.
2094 2018-08-20 19:34:26 SOCO 19- the only way ur getting this spray paint off is baby oil I’m telling u
2095 2018-08-20 19:34:26 Lavender oil on my temple and under my nose helps (I get migraines though). Also a bath or footbath with Epsom salts. CBD salve rubbed on my temple, neck & jaw.

2097 2018-08-20 19:34:21 < started gathering ingredients to make breakfast. Taking the pan and lightly coating it in olive oil and while it heated up. I started cutting up some vegetables and ham and sausage. I broke several eggs and started mixing and poured the mixture >

2099 2018-08-20 19:34:16 The oil is state controlled. Their government hoards the oil reserves and enriches themselves. The government controls the largest part of their economy and that is the problem. Private sectors only work with money circulating. Money to manufacture and money to buy the goods.
2100 2018-08-20 19:34:08 Any suggestions on underwing itching on parrots would be appreciated.
Using a mixture of diluted Tea Tree Oil with high grade Olive Oil might work.
It is probably mites but you have to catch them early - Not Vit A problem!
2101 2018-08-20 19:34:07 Ducks nest closer to gas/oil development trails and have increased nest success (yay!) but shorebirds nest closer and see reduced success (boo ecological trap), via @Sarah_306 #IOCongress2018 #BOUatIOC
2102 2018-08-20 19:33:39 I'm using a new hair oil and it's basically saving my hair rn
2103 2018-08-20 19:33:22 I think she's misquoted the verse. However, chapter 8, verses 270-272 seem to indicate punishments of cutting tongue/burning nail driven through mouth/hot oil poured into mouth and ears for a 'once born'/shudra that insults/speaks ill/preaches to the upper castes/Brahmins.
2104 2018-08-20 19:33:18 Why capsules and not oil? I ordered the oil yesterday, should be delivered tomorrow
2105 2018-08-20 19:33:16 Ah, look at all those oil based products they are wearing!!
2106 2018-08-20 19:33:10 Nothing worse than coming to get an oil change, and being told the other shit that needs to be done to your car
2107 2018-08-20 19:33:09 Dads don’t give advice, they just tell you to check your oil
2108 2018-08-20 19:33:03 What is to be wise,
To be wise means to live in the FEAR OF THE LORD 
Now that the call go meet the Groom has been made for the last 14yrs in this land and world over. And at the same time it's clear there are churches who are busy selling and buying annointing oil now (foolish)
2109 2018-08-20 19:33:02 lmao who need an oil pan anyways
2110 2018-08-20 19:32:58 it has w.w.vinegar listed but lime juice is much higer up than it and right next to the oil. So I don't know what that makes it.
2111 2018-08-20 19:32:50 The country is floating on oil and they have one million percent inflation.
2112 2018-08-20 19:32:47 My aunt got me drinking black seed oil and eating garlic 
2113 2018-08-20 19:32:45 The mechanic quoted me at 2 hours for an oil change, tire rotation and break check and I’m at 17% battery with two group chats blowing up. Please pray for me.
2114 2018-08-20 19:32:35 My Granddaddy of many great grandchildren Abraham gave me land,oil wells and wealth. Beyond I can imagine.

2117 2018-08-20 19:32:21 My lovely co-worker gave me some essential oils to clear the last of my cold. it has to be mixed with olive oil to go on the skin. I've only got truffle olive oil... #MiddleClassProblems
2118 2018-08-20 19:32:13 "It was to everyone’s shock that the economy made a spectacular bounce back".   Wasn't it directly driven by recovery (and massive increase) in price of oil?  (as you say later on in this interesting article).

2127 2018-08-20 19:31:06 Nah im not trying to defend them there asshats but i just dont want to call water oil is all.
2128 2018-08-20 19:31:02 When the evils of socialism and virtues of capitalism are being touted by the former temporary governor of a state with a public profit oil economy common sense gives way to sensationalism. Sarah literally gets an oil check.
2129 2018-08-20 19:30:44 Can testify to the fact that whilst rainy liquid and olive oil in nice bottles  may superficially look similar at dusk, the effect when poured in to a flying pan to cook  steak is very different....

2132 2018-08-20 19:30:28 See that olive oil drizzling, spam faced spiv has annoyed everyone again. This time with his bags of sweaty rice. Personally I wouldn’t watch him grill his head with a slice of pineapple. But it takes alsorts I suppose.
2133 2018-08-20 19:30:28 Let's get to the point! It's the immigration of Muslims that most people abhor. They have a barbaric culture that is in direct conflict with the Judeo-Christian morals and values that the majority of Canadians live by! Muslims will not assimilate! You cannot mix oil with water!
2134 2018-08-20 19:30:22 What are the Trumpistas up to with this? We know Trump simply adores authoritarians, by just not Maduro?
Come on.
Trump has had his mind on invading Venezuela for awhile. Gotta be the oil.
2135 2018-08-20 19:30:02 Jermaine Jackson got an oil spill in the back of his head...

2138 2018-08-20 19:29:43 What annoys me is we're not allowed to do anything about it, 5 hours it took a lorry to get in there today apparently!!!! I don't mind the protesting (pointless as it may be) but when it actually disrupts business then it should be stopped.
2139 2018-08-20 19:29:35 No oil for u until u apologize
2140 2018-08-20 19:29:23 Dumb capitalists to nauve to believe that the neo con gangsters would not want to get their hands on the biggest oil reserves in the world
2141 2018-08-20 19:29:19 @msnbc going live to Trump ICE thing. I press any random button to change channels. I land on Paula D from Jersey Shore interview reminiscing how he burned his face with tanning oil. I’m turning TV off now before it drives me insane. See you later tonight Rachel & Lawrence.
2142 2018-08-20 19:29:16 But now the difference is 5 were wise, (listened and trimmed their lamps because they had extra oil) 5 were foolish (did not have oil) 
The wise ones ENTERED the wedding super of The Lamb of God. ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO ATE WISE WILL ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD PLEASE....
2143 2018-08-20 19:29:12 I can’t get past him strangling his own babies face to face and then tossing them into OIL. I want him to pay dearly.
2144 2018-08-20 19:28:58 Rose oil is really the only thing I consume. Rose in everything. Rose all over. I fucking love rose, you guys.  It’s in basically every step of my beauty routine.

2155 2018-08-20 19:27:57 TransCanada requested a 30 day suspension of its application because of the regulatory changes that included upstream GHGs. Application was then cancelled less than 30 days later. Yes oil prices played a factor but not the main reason.

We have the most sanctions ever imposed on them, their economy is on the ropes, we are squeezing their oil revenues, we've hardened defenses on their border, and WE can attack them by cyber even worse!

2162 2018-08-20 19:26:57 Do lots of Scots settle in the American south? They also love fried anything-at-all! At summer-time fairs, it's fried cookies, fried butter, fried beer (really!), pretty much whatever you can fit in a vat of oil!
2163 2018-08-20 19:26:53 Do you use supplements? 
(Multi-vitamin, protein, fish oil, etc)
If yes, what do you use and why do you use it?
2164 2018-08-20 19:26:45 The oil story tells you that's true! Look at what Norway has generated from smaller oilfields than the U.K. (Scottish waters)! We have nothing to show for our oil! Where did that money go? Read McCrone!
2165 2018-08-20 19:26:37 It makes me quite cross and it beggars belief the protests at Horse Hill.

2166 2018-08-20 19:26:28 If you live in the US and try to say you don't eat industrialized food... Are you only eating fruit/vegetables you grew in your garden?  Where'd you get the seeds?  Are you mining your own salt? Where is your oil coming from?  What do you do in the winter???
2167 2018-08-20 19:26:27 I tried that 4 days ago, after my doctor arbitrarily cut my Norco from 5 per day to 56 per month.

We don’t even know what’s on our own planet... or which species are truly ‘extinct.’ The Deepwater Horizon oilpocalypse was horrifying because we didn’t even know 90% of what we lost from toxic oil & Corexit.

 which generate significant free cash flow relative to their market cap are potentially targets for a leveraged buyout (LBO), because they generate cash that could be used to service debt.
2180 2018-08-20 19:24:39 Does anyone have any recommendations for a place that sells affordable CBD oil?
2181 2018-08-20 19:24:07 Similar bollocks with anxiety and depression. Not “ah shit mate, I’m here, I’m listening”, but “my cousin swears by St John’s Wort” or “lavender oil baths are the thing” etc etc.

2183 2018-08-20 19:23:59 Does anyone else think about how clean the chef is when you go out to eat ? Does he wash his hands , does he change the oil often , does he clean the pan? One of te reason why it’s hard for me to choose a place to eat when your hungry 
2184 2018-08-20 19:23:45 I'm really enjoying battle for azeroth, but it's a little too real in places. Countries...er, factions, going to war over a precious resource, and a quest line that literally involves cleaning oil off of seabirds.
2185 2018-08-20 19:23:43 I only choose the velvet ant because oil actually splashes on hand while cooking x""DDD

2188 2018-08-20 19:23:30 You over value and grossly exaggerate the potential for damage from oil & gas, and you severely under value the quality of life it affords you. Your motivations aren't pragmatic or measured. They're emotional and ripe with platitude.
2189 2018-08-20 19:23:29 Man... @realDonaldTrump is gaslighting so much these days that I'm surprised that big oil hasn't started fracking around the White House.
2190 2018-08-20 19:23:17 Did they hear the news of oil discovery in new country ?
2191 2018-08-20 19:23:11 We have yet to see the worst. High oil prices  are good for Trump's cronies.
2192 2018-08-20 19:23:07 Oh and by the way he’s not on your side , he’s a snake oil salesman sadly people like you think because he sounds like you he is for you ..  he’s a millionaire that built his empire screwing workin men & woman
2193 2018-08-20 19:23:04 Is oil wet
2194 2018-08-20 19:23:03 Well it can sink more readily compared to other oil grades, (also more than one grade of bitumen) depending on the conditions so the sign is hyperbolic but accurate. Who expects protest signs to be 5 paragraphs long with disclaimers about silt and weather and specific gravity?

2196 2018-08-20 19:22:49 The Permanent Fund has been a very generous freebie for Alaskans for years. Since it was predicated on oil prices, it, along with the state’s budget, are hitting reality. The candidates are reluctant to pour sand on the oil expectations. Interesting campaign choices..
2197 2018-08-20 19:22:27 Despite not knowing where to go, I managed to get my car in for an oil change today. And that was a big deal for me.

2201 2018-08-20 19:21:59 I dont have super bad acne. But I have acne. I wash, tone, prep with serum, moisturize, and finish off with facial oil, 2 time a day. I hydrate thoroughly. I eat extremely minimal amounts of Dairy and Saturated fats. I still have acne. It's just my face. And I fucking love it
2202 2018-08-20 19:21:48 See... I don’t know. I’m dropping the butter for coconut oil. But once you start messing with my coffee, I don’t know man

2209 2018-08-20 19:20:46 If that's really your concern, you'd be just as mad at the almond or avocado industry. You have a bias towards one thing, because you perceive it as beneficial to humans, while you malign oil and gas, because you're too privileged to appreciate its positive impact on your life.
2210 2018-08-20 19:20:35 I grilled chicken for my work lunch so I stench like olive oil and smoke. I want to die.
2211 2018-08-20 19:20:31 Tip of the day: use coconut oil for EVERYTHING. Cooking, face mask, lip balm, helps your hair, eyebrows & lashes grow.
2212 2018-08-20 19:20:26 Getting my oil change done at Mr. Lube and I can sit in my car and use their free wifi. Score.
2213 2018-08-20 19:20:17 It actually doesn't use oil at all! It achieves the fast cooking, high heat surrounded environment through air circulation rather than oil!

2215 2018-08-20 19:19:53 #TIL -- Statistic from @GoldmanSachs that U.S. oil explorers "destroying 23 cents on every dollar invested over the past 10 years." Market valuation can certainly stray a long way from capital invested! Especially in capital intensive businesses like mining.

2237 2018-08-20 19:15:03 Resolved in 1946. And they didn't have oil and the vast resources that Vzla. has. Then again... NEITHER did they have Cuban rule (far worse than Soviet) and/or DRUG cartels dominating the economy.

2239 2018-08-20 19:14:51 Yeah, as did investing in Amazon short 10 years ago when the stock was $80 a share (today it's $1880 a share).

2240 2018-08-20 19:14:45 Pretty sure Lysenkoism had its roots in Stalin being uneducated, oil patronage in regional corruption, filling ones own pockets, etc

Requiring genda in balance in employment is good, all open intervening in the process is good for industry if there is nothing to hide, and reducing greenhouse gas is bad. Politicizing is one of the problems hindering oil exploration in Canada.

2276 2018-08-20 19:10:36 mmmm, yeah. It is how they generally operate. From Lysenkoism, to oil patronage, to filling ones own pockets, the favouritism socialists tend to show is often mistaken for capitalism; Hence a number of idiots response of it not being real socialism.

2308 2018-08-20 19:07:49 I suggest olive oil garlic, toasted walnuts, lemon zest, sage and the closest veganism will let you get to parmesan. (Based on a pasta in Ottolenghi's "Plenty More, although his isn't vegan, only vegetarian. Also works great on Gnocchi)
2309 2018-08-20 19:07:37 I seem to remember reading that coconut oil is unhealthy

2313 2018-08-20 19:07:01 Get someone to buy your snake oil, whatever, now you have a verified address with a working credit card. Combine that with public info and database info sold by phone companies and so on, and you have a very valuable commodity.

2315 2018-08-20 19:06:33 This is the usual tired old snake oil sales pitch from the latest labour would be PM. What industry is he going to revive and who is this rampant Brexiter going to sell to? The only time we will see a renaissance in Scotland, of any kind, is when we become independent.
2316 2018-08-20 19:06:16 We’ve been the number one in oil for four years- this isn’t Trump’s doing. The economy also turned around during Obama’s time and this growth started with him- not Trump.  Steel isn’t “back in the US” and the tariffs are costing more jobs than they are going to create.
2317 2018-08-20 19:06:11 Easy money from rubes, typical snake oil salesman bs.

2320 2018-08-20 19:05:55 Sausages hot, the rest cold. Red and yellow peppers, chives, thyme, mint, chopped dates, flaked almonds, borage flowers, tomatoes and a rapeseed oil and balsamic vinegar dressing. I make them up as I go along. Dates work well with venison.

2332 2018-08-20 19:04:43 Well I must say it worked for her third degree burns. Dr told her to use some OTC wash to deprive the massive wound. It dried out the skin and caused bleeding. I used coconut oil to gently to debride dead skin instead. They were not treating her wounds. She didn't match protocol.

2337 2018-08-20 19:03:41 as a non-scientist anti-corporate outsider, i could care less how (or whether) energy is produced, so long as oil companies go out of business.
2338 2018-08-20 19:03:34 There is such a thing as ethical oil its oil that is from countries with high environmental standards and human rights standards Unlike oil from some of the worst offenders in the world like the east coast uses Learn a little before you comment

2347 2018-08-20 19:02:15 “All oil will sink given the right conditions/ time”. That’s what I said. You conveniently picked half the statement to fit your narrative, and you call me disingenuous!
2348 2018-08-20 19:02:08 Did You Know? A single quart of motor oil, if disposed improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.
2349 2018-08-20 19:02:07 About 9 years ago Senator James Inholf (R-OK) was on Maddow's show. What I heard him say "I believed in climate change until I found out how much it cost" convinced me republicans believe in it but vote against it to protect their big industry donors. (Oil companies, Koch's).

2359 2018-08-20 19:00:42 We've had our car at Miller Ford in Lumberton NJ twice for the exact same oil leak. This weekend I checked the oil level and it's leaking from the same exact place. Three months after I had it "fixed" for the second time.
2360 2018-08-20 19:00:40 ummm, fine. I turn it on when i need to put food waste or a lot of oil down the sink. i have to run the water while i do it and it’s very loud. also sometimes it stinks up the sink which isnt great

Our de facto PM claimed the oil sands had expanded too much & needed to be stopped, including stopping pipelines.

2372 2018-08-20 19:00:14 What a snake oil salesman is @RepSteveStivers. Absolutely full of trickle-down economic voodoo snake oil. And spewing all that crap while stuffing his face and drinking beer. Disgusting.

2378 2018-08-20 18:59:24 ah.... no dill (well no fresh dill) so went for a little thyme.  plus sliced lemon and seasoning and olive oil.  Bing!   Now in oven 180 for 20 mins

2380 2018-08-20 18:58:55 Ask Mr Farage where he gets his particular brand of snake oil from. Any serious political questions on the EU are wasted on such a cold blooded creature.
2381 2018-08-20 18:58:45 Question for the health food people out there. Sunflower seeds?  Was told not to use the oil anymore but what about snacking on the seeds? #coffeetalk

2383 2018-08-20 18:58:26 Fuck this answer.

Heat it up on the stove with a little oil in a covered pan.
2384 2018-08-20 18:58:11 Exactly - the BHP & torque required is still the same. I still feel sorry for petrol/diesel owners because we have been an oil producing nation for decades but have never enjoyed cheap fuel like other countries. At 50mpg we need 2 gallons & that SHOULD only be £1.25-ish each !!
2385 2018-08-20 18:58:11 For those making much about the size of Venezuela's oil reserves, keep in mind that Venezuelan crude is garbage. Refining it is a pain....
2386 2018-08-20 18:58:11 Where do y’all go to get an oil change? 
2387 2018-08-20 18:58:06 Watering my plants, I realized I needed to harvest my Thai chili peppers. No idea what to use em for so I chopped em up & put them in a container. THEN I got inspired and now I have chili-infused oil going. So proud of myself rn. Next time? I'm making my own chili chocolate. 
2388 2018-08-20 18:57:59 VZ was never a paradise. Your suggested trip would only be fair if it happened before Goldman-Sachs, Saudi Arabia & US decided to crash global oil prices. And then we would ask you to go to pre-Chavez VZ & live among the majority of the population & let us know how you survived.

2403 2018-08-20 18:56:10 "All oil will sink"

So the narrative is correct. Its all about perspective., Your declaration is as disingenuous as theirs.

2424 2018-08-20 18:53:38 My feeling is that Ontario and Quebec want a devalued dollar to keep their failing manufacturing sector alive for another decade. Blockading western oil and gas is seen as an easy way of doing that with the added benefit of slowing down the economic and policial power shift west.

2428 2018-08-20 18:53:18 Might seem like a joke but Dino Melaye should push a bill to standardize food measurements in Nigeria. We don't measure metric or imperial, we use things like derica, basket, modu etc. Even oils are not in litres. A bottle of oil is actually 75cl. 1 derica is <1kg.

2438 2018-08-20 18:52:04 Haha. My only solace for this season me thinks - at least the oil money might be of some fucking use.

2446 2018-08-20 18:51:20 The state oil company was under pressure after ConocoPhillips, which had won an arbitration ruling in a decade-long fight, seized cargoes and terminals to force compliance.
2447 2018-08-20 18:51:08 o bore fa!... ka fish oil
2448 2018-08-20 18:50:57 I'm a "all in" guy. Coal, wind, solar, oil, thermal, hydro, nuclear, etc. Any reasonable person is. Believe also in always striving to be more efficient & responsible. In his defense, windmills do kill a lot of birds. YouTube it. Easy to find.
2449 2018-08-20 18:50:46 Yes there are variables, and water conditions are always changing. The Point is that dilbit doesn’t sink any more or less than other oils. 

Which is why the narrative put out by enviro groups that dilbit sinks is false. All oil will sink given the right conditions / time.
2450 2018-08-20 18:50:37 People are ridiculous... it’s actually easier to do vegan Keto because too much protein (meat) will mess up ketosis. Eating avocado, MCT oils and coconut oil dressing on above ground veggies in a salad is the best.

2453 2018-08-20 18:50:22 In the interest of honesty, highlight some Democrats doing the very same thing. 
They do, you know it, but you won't.  
Why you are a partisan shill with 0 credibility
2454 2018-08-20 18:50:16 kikikik please do .. en if by chance you have anointing oil stashed in yo closet.. do share w .lol
2455 2018-08-20 18:50:01 None Gary they are superb! Super fast, very slim & light back bored barrels pattern way better with big shot too. Just not as quick to clean as your inertia driven M2 but saying that I can strip my SX3 down to to clean & oil and have it back together fully serviced inside an hr
2456 2018-08-20 18:50:01 Don't make me kick you in the junk, oil lobbyist.

2458 2018-08-20 18:49:46 Trump, in a continuing effort to sate the greed of big oil, is now proposing all manner of bovine excrement reasons to put a stop to higher fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles; and he claims he has scientific and expert proof to justify his crusade. NOT!

2461 2018-08-20 18:49:36 Oh well that's easy. Either dump em in pools acid or chop up their bodies, throw em in barrels of diesel oil, and set it on fire. Finishing touch is: throw cans// bodies into huge pit where dust and remains are buried.
2462 2018-08-20 18:49:23 Is the drum of oil part of the prize package?

2470 2018-08-20 18:48:59 Let's hope it's the 2.4 million Gold security contract or even better a bigger oil security contract.
2471 2018-08-20 18:48:56 Have you seen Venezuela today people are storming the boarders to the other nations. I give it 2-3 weeks at most before Socialism destroys it completely. Whats crazy they have the largest oil reserves in the world. We took Citgo back from them two weeks ago all assets are the US
2472 2018-08-20 18:48:55 thats why its "micarle" oil babey!!!
2473 2018-08-20 18:48:44 Considering you claim to understand the different specific gravity of oil grades I just provided a list them I'm not sure how you could declare that.
2474 2018-08-20 18:48:43 Lavender oil in the diffuser to send this congestion on it’s way.
2475 2018-08-20 18:48:34 you should of the state spending as an oil tanker,once it is set on a path it takes a long time to turn it around. the national debt was always going to keep going up for years after Labour were kicked out,especially when didn't really slash the size of the state at all.

2478 2018-08-20 18:48:15 If your lunch was an aromatic onion fest, and you have a meeting coming up; you can mask the onion breath by brushing your teeth and tongue with coconut oil. Everything else just makes your breath smell like minty hummus.
2479 2018-08-20 18:48:10 Hey Gary. Osmo polyx oil is the same across the range. If you buy the “Worktop oil” you’ll only be paying more for the same thing. I can highly recommend Osmo tho!
2480 2018-08-20 18:48:10 I love my job, but it’s really hard sometimes. And it’s annoying that I’m 500 miles away from needing an oil change that wasn’t dated until December. That is all.
2481 2018-08-20 18:48:00 Venezuela would be fucked without US intervention. When they nationalized their oil industry it went to shit, because the government is so corrupt.
2482 2018-08-20 18:47:54 The Nordic model is NOT socialism. Plus they pay 65% tax and 25% sales tax. Their economy is propped up by fracking and a HUGE oil find off the coast of Norway.
2483 2018-08-20 18:47:44 The only thing funnier is that there's Proud Boys-branded beard oil.

2486 2018-08-20 18:47:22 Showing no remorse or guilt while smiling about killing your pregnant wife and two of your children who you dumped their bodies in oil tanks who loved you and looked up to you and saw you as their protector and safe haven is more than fucked up.
2487 2018-08-20 18:47:18 @GaryandShannon Also in regards to CO murder, it is believed he killed his daughters a couple of days atleast before his wife got home.  As per the report of the state of their bodies in the drums of oil they were found in.  :(

2489 2018-08-20 18:47:00 We have the 3rd biggest oil reserves in the world and unable to compete globally because we can’t  get our product to tidewater, do you not think other oil producing countries such as Russia and Saudi would like to keep it that way?
2490 2018-08-20 18:46:28 Truth:  the rich oil and coal barons don’t want us getting renewable, clean, inexpensive energy.  They lose their businesses!

In the States, we sold Health to the Health Care Industry and the Actuarial Bet-Hedgers of Big Insurance, and we gave Big Oil and the Big Three our cultural mobility. We branded it American, and thought little of the consequences

2517 2018-08-20 18:43:49 You wuz robbed. But the oil was UK oil, so not that way. Many English regions also didn't see any benefit from the oil, just the same as Scotland.

2535 2018-08-20 18:41:50 I think the question needs to be more implicit, these snake oil salesmen wriggle out of questions. The question needs to be, do you always use the NHS when the NHS provision is always available to you, or do you choose to use private healthcare?

2541 2018-08-20 18:41:31 Their economy is still mostly private sector i.e. Capitalist. Anyone with even a basic understanding of Venezuelan history (which clearly doesn’t include Charlie Kirk) would know their main problem is dependence on oil.

2548 2018-08-20 18:40:36 Delia also salts and drains the aubergine slices, so they probably absorb less oil than they would if you don’t flour or salt them.
2549 2018-08-20 18:40:21 Hemp Oil, at least this brand, can be applied topically (on the skin) or ingested (slurp!) or both. It’s the only brand I’ve tried, but if it works (and does it ever!) I’m content.
2550 2018-08-20 18:40:20 There’s something else I’ve noticed. Many people here look kinda... sad and depressed. You just need to take a few trips in the metro to see what I mean. Maybe it’s the recession/oil and gas???

2558 2018-08-20 18:39:57 Sure is a pickle..... They can't price electricity much higher because people have and will switch to oil and wood for winter heating. I bet revenues have already declined due the doubling price that is out there. It's either this approach or a massive subsidy to NL Hydro.

2573 2018-08-20 18:38:34 I’d argue another flawed research. Ie what’s controlled for, what’s not? Eg industrially raised, cured, crap-fed, processed etc vs pastured/wild, natural-diet-fed, hormone/antibiotic-free etc? Omega 3 vs 6? Corn or olive oil? Hydrogenated? Fiber? Preservatives?Glyphosate-grown?
2574 2018-08-20 18:38:28 They just love making a white dude a good person... even when he murders his family with his bare hands, then tries to dispose of their bodies in oil. Fucking media.

2576 2018-08-20 18:38:18 What's already there is good: freezing monetary assets of Russian oligarchs and their businesses and the country's economy. Hitting state banks, oil companies, and arms makers. All things that make their oligarchs' and leader richer.
2577 2018-08-20 18:37:58 Not only that, any other blend of oil would have reacted the exact same way in that situation.

2584 2018-08-20 18:36:43 Hi! This was done on procreate with the Turpintine brush (it’s like an oil/acrylic) I blended it with the round brush! I actually don’t like procreates blending that much, and I prefer Artstudio Pro cause it mimics a real blending of hues much better
2585 2018-08-20 18:36:41 Remembering that time yesterday when @signify04  thought I'd made a southern fried chicken curry. Imagine toasting the selection of Indian spices gently in oil before going to the Freezer n casually crackin open a couple of mini fillets coated in the colonels secret rub.

2586 2018-08-20 18:36:41 Wlhi thats why i respect those without makeup..
2587 2018-08-20 18:36:26 And then they get an exam question about oil dripping out of an accelerating car and can't work out what's going on and moan it's "not on the spec"....
2588 2018-08-20 18:36:12 No not a joke. But you are. Rosneft oil .
2589 2018-08-20 18:36:08 #UKOG the obvious success of HH and news to buy more of the oil rich site has send panic down the short crew . The protesters have been used as a tool to try to allow a lower entry or close positions in the share imo as no fracking is being done at HH .
2590 2018-08-20 18:36:00 Errrrm! When politicians mount platforms what are the 2 major campaign messages they put across to attract voters? Did those campaigners factor the very info you’re putting here in their political gimmicks? Don’t bring your oil knowledge into this and don’t compare Ghana to USA.
2591 2018-08-20 18:35:58 Police in Uganda are so idle...or so stupid!
2592 2018-08-20 18:35:50 I'm from Jersey and as this will be my first time attending, I'll bring chicken parmesan.  Oh and some fresh Italian bread with oil and herbs.  For those that are vegan, I will also be bringing eggplant parmesan.

2598 2018-08-20 18:34:50 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
2599 2018-08-20 18:34:46 It's strange that some men will drink and eat anything put before them,but check very carefully the oil put in the car.

2604 2018-08-20 18:33:49 The Terre Haute mailman just came up to me and said it was really impressive that I knew how to put oil in my car. Ummm?? Of course I know, but thank you for thinking all women are too stupid to know how to do that

2606 2018-08-20 18:33:42 It's wired hearing someone watching your video while your getting your oil changed and not being able to say your jokes along with the video
2607 2018-08-20 18:33:39 "We see that oil was in fact one of the Government's most important  strategic considerations, and it secretly colluded with oil companies s  to give them access to that huge prize."

2612 2018-08-20 18:33:00 So I listened to #Sweetener again, and I think if all of the tracks that Pharrell produced weren’t on it (half of the cd) I think it would have been great. He and Ariana are like oil & water, and hope they don’t work together anytime soon

2616 2018-08-20 18:32:39 Unless the oil that flows in EnergyEast is sold for nothing, what does the cost of building the pipeline have to do with how much we import? There’s probably a strong argument for building EnergyEast but this ain’t it.
2617 2018-08-20 18:32:37 I find olaplex strengthens my hair and then sleeping with oil in it makes it glossy n soft? There’s a 3 step treatment that’s useful if you bleach/colour your hair at home but if not just use step 3 once a week.

2621 2018-08-20 18:32:09 Republicans at all levels are liars and dividers. There is no place for them in a free, democratic society. First of all it was the oil moguls who created the desparate tyrannical system that still is evident in Venezuala today. 1/2
2622 2018-08-20 18:32:05 Data Analytics Primer at #ILTACON18 #G022 with @EJWalters was amazing, inspirational. To paraphrase: Data is, in fact, the new oil. Firms are sitting on massive amounts of data. But, like crude oil, it must be refined before you can get any value out of it.

2630 2018-08-20 18:30:36 Too many old people stay stuck when they could have far more convenient life elsewhere. I know a guy that delivers home heating oil to old homeowners in houses worth $350k, $400k that they can't keep up and can't afford heat, when they could sell.

2645 2018-08-20 18:29:26 The odds are frightening to leave to chance, since all the virgins are believers. I think the foolish virgins’ lack of sufficient oil supply suggests a belief the Bridegroom is coming earlier in the night, or perhaps that it will all work out no matter what.
2646 2018-08-20 18:29:08 Because people have already caught onto the snake oil scams. Supplements are the snake oil for the new century!

2659 2018-08-20 18:26:59 It could, but Chavez ripped me off on 2 investments & I have no love for the VZ economic strategy, but western coverage of VZ since oil prices collapsed is mostly nonsense. Implication is that until VZ removes gov't & takes Washington Consensus medicine, all will be disastrous.

The world (incl us) need it to live. Blocking our resource which pays a significant amount to the rest of this country is asinine.

2704 2018-08-20 18:21:40 The DOE offers 11 mln barrels of sour crude from US strategic reserves. This is a part of the budget agreement and has nothing to do with prices. There are some suspicions that if oil doesn't fall further, POTUS could release more.  Front-month Oct contract up small.

2708 2018-08-20 18:21:16 just to let you know hemp oil is not a drug it is an extract from the plant, it would not appear on any sort of drug test. where did you get your information from?
2709 2018-08-20 18:21:14 @CrushCityTrader You are 100% correct.  Looks like the mkt priced in a larger SPR release than this if u judge strictly by the price action.

Further, I am short.  I have pure demand-side models suggesting FMV of oil is in the low 50s but no cares about short run, esp. on #OOTT
2710 2018-08-20 18:21:08 When you break the fast @ 6-7pm, drink one tsp of oil, say gingerly oil, if coconut oil was taken in the morning.

N then eat light meals, say Salads, Egg, Curd, Red Rice, millets etc.

It's essential to consume good amount of water.
I customized mine by taking 400 ml butter milk

2717 2018-08-20 18:19:35 @realDonaldTrump THE ESEQUIBO IS A TERRITORY IN DISPUTE IN VENEZUELA. HOW COME, EXXON IS DIGING OIL IN THAT TERRITORY?  ARE YOU PREPARING TO RECEIVED THE OIL FOUND IN THAT TERRITORY AND ADECUATING REFINARIES TO GET THAT OIL?. SOMETIMES I WONDER IF VENEZUELAN CRISIS IS DUE TO THAT
2718 2018-08-20 18:19:31 cooking with coconut oil is like one scoop for the dough one for my chin other scoop for the dough another for my hand a third schoop for the dough and also my entire face etc etc
2719 2018-08-20 18:19:28 “What you’re gonna do now is apply the powder foundation in a dabbing motion, and cry in frustration when you see that the oil from your T zone is already seeping through it!”
2720 2018-08-20 18:19:23 i bought myself the oh so heavenly, pomegranate & rosehip oil hand cream and my hands never smelled and look amazing. 
2721 2018-08-20 18:19:19 Ye need a snapchat filter!! That’ll sort out those lines around yer eyes quicker that oil of Olay 
2722 2018-08-20 18:19:05 I'm very excited for the day that a boxer writes "they don't want that smoke" and Anthony Fowler offers them a CBD oil alternative with a 15% off code.

2727 2018-08-20 18:18:52 The Natural Teething Oil I use for Jaxon works soooo good 
It’s like orajel but Olive Oil, Clove Oil, and Mint Oil
2728 2018-08-20 18:18:38 I’m so sorry for this. Immunotherapy, cannabis oil, to kill cancer cells. Ketamine is being used for pain and depression and it really works! There are clinics around the US. Prayers
2729 2018-08-20 18:18:29 Anyone who's ever watched fitness YouTube videos has seen this a million times. Just another snake oil salesmen selling you caffeine for 50 bucks a bottle. Just go buy caffeine pills or some coffee it's the same
2730 2018-08-20 18:18:27 Thanks! They’re lovely cars, and I’m amazed by the reliability. Mine is slightly boosted and running 180 euro junk yard engine, yet all it needed was about 0,5 l of oil over very hard driven 7800 kms.
2731 2018-08-20 18:18:23 I hear what you say and the govt seizure of the US oil company investment was the starting point. Venezuelans have been leaving the country in droves  to find work in Colombia because of the financial stress and lack of basic foodstuffs
2732 2018-08-20 18:18:22 They dubb ND oil wealth a national wealth even when nothing comes from their moribund states, created for them to attract ND oil monies

They're as much thieves as their NGn state, applying their criminal apparatus, NG, since 1970 to steal from the ND on their behalf. ...3/
2733 2018-08-20 18:18:20 @altonbrown How long can fresh Caesar dressing be stored out of fridge? Used primo olive oil so hesitant to refrigerate.
2734 2018-08-20 18:18:16 It's surprisingly difficult to buy a barrel of crude oil
2735 2018-08-20 18:18:09 Adam Boqvist gonna be the most exciting thing in Traverse City other than the dunes and that one store that sells fancy olive oil
2736 2018-08-20 18:18:08 Venezuela controls a larger portion of both their electric energy (95% vs 90%) and oil/gas (100% vs 80%) markets, while Norway has greater control over healthcare (100% vs 80%).

The difference is that Norway's technocrats are infinitely more competent capitalists.

2741 2018-08-20 18:16:53 What if it involved like bird masks and baby oil?
2742 2018-08-20 18:16:47 It's a scam, they're all worse than some gud chili oil
2743 2018-08-20 18:16:43 Super easy!!!! It’s just lime juice, cilantro, salt, and pepper. You just add it your finished white/brown rice in a non stick pan with a little bit of olive oil.

I'm surprised you're still here tweeting when your mates are on their way to becoming crude oil. Shior.
2746 2018-08-20 18:16:30 We shall see what he let's me get away with. So far there is the ball bearings, a piano, 6 chairs, a China hutch, several book shelves, a candle under a metal door knob, flasks of oil hanging from the ceiling, and my character riding a natural 20+7 stealth.
2747 2018-08-20 18:16:23 hawking intellectual & actual snake oil.  Maybe Shapiro ans @DLoesch can together hawk a pomegranate version of this junk
2748 2018-08-20 18:16:19 Oh, that's about eating coconut oil. Interesting.

2754 2018-08-20 18:15:22 Our economy isn’t good but from the angle you were coming from that was a NO NO. As someone in the oil industry I know what I am talking about. If dollar is the standard you normally find fuel/gas prices per litre  more than a dollar. Now answer my question.
2755 2018-08-20 18:15:17 Wow cant wait for you to come over and feel the GOOD VIBES of my apartment before I BURN YOUR EYES with peppermint oil!
2756 2018-08-20 18:15:05 If oil and water don’t mix, surely being messy and anointed won’t either.
2757 2018-08-20 18:14:49 Should we expect some "Freedom" to be spread in Venezuela soon? God knows they have oil, and the US has been wanting to install a puppet for years.
2758 2018-08-20 18:14:39 It's shocking the things that have palm oil when there is no need for it. We have boycotted so many foods

2762 2018-08-20 18:14:06 Rice cooker so #Easy to use!! I do 2cups rinsed rice, 3-3 1/2 cups (my opinion, extra liquid is needed for brown rice) low sodium veggie, chicken or bone broth, a little olive oil, & the seasonings I want. Mine has settings for white & brown rice. Set it & you're done!
2763 2018-08-20 18:14:04 @iAmNiyola does your hair smell like hot oil
2764 2018-08-20 18:13:56 Yep it's wall-to-wall fish and chips for me, cooked over a fire of Jamie Oliver's recipe books. He can take his olive oil and 'appropriated' Italian cuisine and shove it where the sun don't shine. Fucking Nazi.
2765 2018-08-20 18:13:52 HOW TO USE TEA TREE OIL ON SPOTS 

- Take a Q-tip. Put a drop of tea tree oil on it. You can add drops of water if you have a sensitive skin.
- Dab the Q-Tip on your spots. Don’t apply it all over your face.
2766 2018-08-20 18:13:46 Do you know acute symptoms? If it's way to personal here, send me a DM when you can. I know I should "old-lady-ish" but maybe an essential oil run may help?
2767 2018-08-20 18:13:36 No Nigerian has the moral right to label anyone corrupt becos they are opportunistic thieves--all of them

2770 2018-08-20 18:13:05 Without doubt, but the principle of an "oil standard" currency is interesting. As it happens, Venezuela couldn't run such a currency, because you need more than "enough oil in the ground" to make it feasible.

Overkill of pharma, agriculture and poison production is skyhigh. Plastic still is everywhere, under the sink, keep pumping oil! Fly for 25 euri around the globe!

2779 2018-08-20 18:12:16 If the gears are plastic, contact cleaner will work well enough. You can find that at Lowe’s for cheap. But if it’s bad, I know they sell oil for old tape decks that works for small geared appliances.  I haven’t used it so I can’t vouch for its effectiveness.

2782 2018-08-20 18:12:08 Not sure if it’s the AHA and hydrating toner, or hydrating toner and rosehip oil, or AHA and rosehip oil, or all of the above. Quite sure it wasn’t the Vit C. I also felt nga na daghanan ra nako ang AHA, so maybe it reacted with the others...

2786 2018-08-20 18:11:18 it actually irks me that I have to wait another 1000 miles to get my oil changed, thanks to the mechanics (for once) not trying to get over on me.
2787 2018-08-20 18:11:17 OK think about more working paying more taxes because they are buying more and feel better because economy better. GDP grows income all around goes up. It's a move in right direction now steel is back in US. We are number one in oil now
2788 2018-08-20 18:11:15 I agree accessing that oil and utilizing it is another thing. Iraq has plenty of oil but does not benefit due to poor infrastructure.

2793 2018-08-20 18:10:46 I can't speak for anyone but myself, but it is upsetting that well meaning patriots like yourself who love their country and their fellow Americans would be taken advantage of by charlatans selling the 8Chan equivalent of Snake Oil.
2794 2018-08-20 18:10:34 No NAFTA, new tariffs on steel and aluminum. Vehicles may be next. no pipelines started, have to rely on Saudi Oil as Trudeau can't get a west-east pipeline built - rather doesn't want one and increased regulation hurdles so Trans-Canada would pull out.

Nobody knows 'snake oil' quite like polemicist Paul Krugman and, frankly, nobody has parlayed it into any bigger personal advantage ... than he.  [Remember absurd praise the @nytimes heaped upon him.]
2801 2018-08-20 18:09:26 Hahaha obviously nooowww. Lol I remember I applied for one oil job in Cameroon from here and I called to follow up oh boy come and see insults

2803 2018-08-20 18:09:15 Unfortunately, I’m one of those folks who are allergic to weed. However, an occasional contact high doesn’t hurt me.  I also have discovered the miracle of Cannabis Hemp Oil.

2804 2018-08-20 18:09:11 Dude yes!!! I’m watching some hair tutorials on YouTube and all of them put castor oil and I know those curling creams do no make it smell any better. I’ve tried!!

2811 2018-08-20 18:08:40 We all kiss their terrorist ass for oil. Time to drop them like a bad habit & let the chips fall where they may. We are old enough & smart enough to drop fossil fuels as well & get moving on energy that is abundant, sustainable and devoid of politics. This is the new revolution!
2812 2018-08-20 18:08:36 Oya.. when now??
2813 2018-08-20 18:08:33 can i use avocado or peach shampoo with coconut oil conditioner or is that gonna smell disgusting
2814 2018-08-20 18:08:30 "A+" answer @Leeboy1230!  Boiled or poached are both correct answers because you avoid the oil and grease associated with frying an egg while still enjoying all of its nutrients by eating the yoke. Thanks for submitting your answer!!

2818 2018-08-20 18:07:33 

Tea tree oil is toxic when swallowed. Serious side effects can occur, including:

-Confusion
-A lack of muscle control or coordination of voluntary movements (ataxia)
Decreasing levels of consciousness.

However, tea tree oil can cause:

-Skin irritation
-Allergic skin rash (dermatitis)
-Itching
-Stinging
-Burning
-Scaling
-Redness
-Dryness

Don't use tea tree oil if you have eczema!

2838 2018-08-20 18:05:46 What made it so "radical" was its employment of oil $ to rectify social ills, and the engagement of millions of working class people in democratic processes. That meant that more of the economy *could* come under state ownership & that's enough to make it scary "socialism"

2841 2018-08-20 18:05:23 Considering the geopolitical issues tied with oil supplies from middle eastern countries, EU should take steps to reduce its dependence on oil by increasing use of natural gas. Natural gas, in form of LNG is much more available on free market from practically all continents.
2842 2018-08-20 18:05:20 Are you guys talking about CBD oil? I have a friend who’s using that and swears by it for her arthritis.

2845 2018-08-20 18:05:03  CAUTIONS WHEN USING TEA TREE OIL 

Avoid oral use of tea tree oil, which is toxic when swallowed.

2849 2018-08-20 18:04:38 Note: all this water is recycled as most oil companies even have their own recycling plants, recycling the water is most the cost of fracking....
2850 2018-08-20 18:04:35 Yep! Coal, oil and asbestos. That's @realDonaldTrump 's favorite merchandice. Just what the world needs more of!
2851 2018-08-20 18:04:33 State owned enterprises in Norway account for about 60% of its GDP. The state employs 38% of the country's workforce. You're right in that this is largely driven by the oil industry, but that's the exact same situation as with Venezuela. They're fundamentally the same.
2852 2018-08-20 18:04:29 No Paella is rice .
The chorizo helps the oil turn the rice yellow but saffron should be in  there.
Also Garlic, onion I'm sure you added them .
Everyone thinks paella should have prawns and mussels in it but this isn't the case.
Psta would be nice with it as well.  Spirali.
2853 2018-08-20 18:04:25 That's a lot of pam oil but that cassava leaf looks good..
2854 2018-08-20 18:04:18 最近どころか一年以上描いてないきがするので今度棒人間OILさん描きますね
2855 2018-08-20 18:04:17 That wild growth hair oil got my hair growing stupid long 
2856 2018-08-20 18:04:15 Ai I don't know, I can only recognise the oil.

At least we can share
2857 2018-08-20 18:04:11 Same. Had a coolant flush and tune up don this morning for $300 and was like oh yeah that’s why I never serviced my cars outside of oil.
2858 2018-08-20 18:04:09 surge, I like you because you make a fine citrus drink with no brominated vegetable oil. Not because I am nostalgic for garbage from the 90's.
2859 2018-08-20 18:04:07 Believe it or not but getting your oil changed at the dealership is way cheaper
2860 2018-08-20 18:03:58 Just amazing." Precisely!! (an understatement... ).
Huge resources (agriculture, oil & minerals, hydroelectric...), enviable geographical location...= HUGE Hiperinflation. 
Nothing similar anywhere past or present, not even Zimbabwe.  
Also unique: combo drug traffic + communism
2861 2018-08-20 18:03:53 How do you break oil addiction by introducing even more oil, exactly?
Is your proposal for ending the opioid epidemic tómale opioids cheaper and more widely available too?
2862 2018-08-20 18:03:51 My heart goes out to the man who took the life of the man who raped his daughter, that I can understand where is his family pic?

I can’t wrap my mind around the Animal that killed his pregnant wife & little girls & stuffed them in an oil tank & is made to look like a good guy!
2863 2018-08-20 18:03:38 I was searching for an old tweet on this but I could not find it.  The idea is that unlike all other crude markers, the yuan denominated oil contract has an additional serius risk, the exchange rate risk.
2864 2018-08-20 18:03:37 Call it what you want.....Just go and buy some of my oil
2865 2018-08-20 18:03:30 Oh man Guiliani reminds me of the serial evictee that lives in my building smoking meth all night soaked in veggie oil used to lubricate and masturbate... Just ew
2866 2018-08-20 18:03:19 There's little net benefit to wars nowadays.

E.g. why doesn't the US just invade Mexico - wouldn't the oil pay off? Why doesn't Germany invade Denmark?

When you look up the causes/factors of war, "anarchy" isn't one of them.
2867 2018-08-20 18:03:10 2/3 Separate pots and pans & color coded utensils must be used to ensure #vegetarian sentiments are respected. If vegetarian food is fried in the same oil as the #meat, it cannot be called vegetarian anymore. #restaurants #chipotle #respectsentiments
2868 2018-08-20 18:03:03 Health conscious food..... In my home in Manipur we called it steam curry.. Without ghee or oil. The green look more like Kashmiri saak.

2870 2018-08-20 18:02:39 @FLOTUS is a terrible role model!! She’s all over the internet wearing oil and another woman. Nope. If we want our kids to be the best, we need more strong women leaders @MichelleObama immediately comes to mind. She’s intelligent, beautiful, and a phenomenally respectable woman.
2871 2018-08-20 18:02:36 Through studying bio i learned a lot about unsaturated fatty acids and they aren’t good for you. I’ve never been a big fan of coconut oil but i thought the good point of this was to make sure you use things in moderation.
2872 2018-08-20 18:02:32 my hands r so dry i need to soak it in a tub of oil or smthg
2873 2018-08-20 18:02:32 With an oil embargo and training and arming groups that the Japanese were fighting. Why do you think Japan attacked?
2874 2018-08-20 18:02:31 Fuck the oil!!!
2875 2018-08-20 18:02:27 China is biggest importer of Oil in world it can make small adjustment by taking in entire Iranian oil export...and it wont be much by Chinese standard .

It only shows power of #China , #EU is weak and acted as expected . #Russia is already helping Iran . #Iran will be fine
2876 2018-08-20 18:02:25 @fiannafailparty and the @greenparty_ie are the only government who have ever reduced our carbon emissions. They put half a million people out of work. Another 100k emigrated. No one could afford oil or gas to heat their homes or put petrol in their cars.
2877 2018-08-20 18:02:22 The EPA should be renamed EDA, Environment Destruction Agency. This week they will introduce , rather remove, regulations on coal, oil and gas. Destruction of the climate. Leading to more toxic gases, dirtier air and pollution. Trump wants to kill the planet, not only the USA.
2878 2018-08-20 18:02:17 Nice body
2879 2018-08-20 18:02:03 @realDonaldTrump Many people running away from the crisis in Venezuela are being abused in lands like Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Pls. our crisis can be solved for the return of our people.WE DON`T WANT ANOTHER SIRIA IN OUR DEAR VENEZUELA. EXXON IS DIGGIN OIL IN DISPUTE TERRITORY
2880 2018-08-20 18:01:57 Why are you asking me? I only stated that the more CO2 there is available for plants to use. Hence "plant your trees now" comment. Look back at the plant growth that gives us our coal & oil, high CO2 back then i am sure you will agree
2881 2018-08-20 18:01:44 Success comes with highs & lows.....Elon, why not make some solar
run cars for the Saudis.....they'll be out of oil ...uuhm....5 or more years
from now?
2882 2018-08-20 18:01:44 Probably the Fish Oil display—15% off thru Wednesday
2883 2018-08-20 18:01:30 Changing the subject? You just told me to quote a reference. I quoted over 3 million.
I have shown you the relative pay of a climate researcher and an oil co scientist....you should look at the facts instead of drivel from asinine conspiracy sites..
2884 2018-08-20 18:01:21 Alas, @JustinTrudeau has shown his true colours by supporting the oil companies, ignoring fresh water issues with both #FirstNations & Navigable Waters protection; and broken his word on #ERRE.  #Canada is failing to meet #climatetargets.  I'm voting #NDP. #cdnpoli
2885 2018-08-20 18:01:11 Going to get my oil change, new tire, and my tires rotate and balance 
2886 2018-08-20 18:01:04 The Left has it’s own snake oil industry. It’s called “Socialism”.
2887 2018-08-20 18:00:45 I sincerely hope that part of your making America great again plan is having strong foreign policies again and acting on behalf of life and liberties (not oil). Real people are suffering, be great again by acting great again. Please, now
2888 2018-08-20 18:00:44 What percentage of CA offshore oil goes to fuel production vs other industrial uses?
2889 2018-08-20 18:00:39 The next Alex Jones. Buy my propaganda and snake oil.
2890 2018-08-20 18:00:33 And more world peace because of less oil money for combative dictators.

2893 2018-08-20 18:00:24 Es una tragedia lo que han hecho en @PDVSA . En 1945 la producción era de 900.000 barriles de petróleo, en 1926 sela Standard Oil descubrió importantes yacimientos en Quiri Quire. 73 años más tarde sucumbe la producción en caso.
2894 2018-08-20 18:00:16 Yes, you're all right because Doritos is so healthy for us it causes us no harm. Red 40. Yellow 6, yellow 5 and with all those hydrogenated oil. Stupid me for ever thinking Doritos is harmful to humans. Continue eating them. Bon appetite.
2895 2018-08-20 18:00:12 Oil Steadiness.  Backwardation is flattening. Price is steady. Projected range to hold equilibrium until U.S. elections.  64 to 74 ish.  2019 will be all about balancing growth and demand by diversifying Transportation among alternatives to meet all needs. Innovation saved it.

2900 2018-08-20 17:59:45 The fact that people don't see that Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones are the exact same is baffling. They're both selling bullshit snake oil products too like you can't make this shit up.
2901 2018-08-20 17:59:34 2 wks into the EPL and no @MenInBlazers on the tele?  Forget Peak Oil, have we reached Peak Crap, where there just isn't enough sub-optimal to go around anymore?
2902 2018-08-20 17:59:34 2011 WPP collaborated with Technip (a leader in Oil & Gas) for a total investment of $50 Billion USD for mega projects in Morocco.

#WPPENERGY #ico
2903 2018-08-20 17:59:25 How much oil revenue have the UK Gov collected from Scottish waters since the seventies? Should be at least half again making the discussion premature. The oil has been running out since it all began for Aberdeen.
2904 2018-08-20 17:59:22 #BreakingNews: Trump won. EU parts ways with Iranian oil as China defies US pressure. Iran's ailing economy wont survive and nuclear research and enrichment would invite US military wrath closer to Pakistan's borders. Its coming. Iran would be destroyed.
2905 2018-08-20 17:59:16 The crisis is started by capitalist US / UK governments sanctions on socialist  Venezuela  the capitalist wants to bring down the country then grab all venezuelas oil , gold and gas ....we must stand with our venezuelan sisters and brothers and fight the capitalists.!

2908 2018-08-20 17:58:52 Well come on man. Youre blocking their frequencies. Its exactly like yelling 'Snake Oil Salesman' in front of a snake oil salesman's booth. How are they supposed to lead people to alt right thought or peddle pizzagate conspiracies with you drawing attention to it? I can't even...
2909 2018-08-20 17:58:49 How much money did/will @IvankaTrump make with her NEW trademarks? How many endangered species will @DonaldJTrumpJr kill? How much oil rich, sacred land will @EricTrump buy? 
When will jr and #jaredtrump be charged with TREASON?

2910 2018-08-20 17:58:47 Look into a double cleansing process. Start w an oil cleanser and then when u rinse that off, follow up w a foam cleanser. (I use boscia and belif, respectively) and moisturize! You shouldn’t have to use toooooo many products but you definitely get what you pay for in my opinion
2911 2018-08-20 17:58:44 You really know what is IQ?i really dont think so,so please take omega 3,6,9 from GNC or something better and this is a free advize for u ok please take Sacha inchi oil and after 3-4 months of treatment you will get your synapses in balance and understand the way that this work
2912 2018-08-20 17:58:30 I definitely need to go in for an oil change this week  and maybe get my tires rotated
2913 2018-08-20 17:58:15 You get somebody you know to do that and supply the oil and filter... you fancy man 
2914 2018-08-20 17:58:14 You pretend Alex Jones is a Conservative leader. He’s better than you, BTW. Advertising is not hawking (more lies from you). And how do you know it’s snake oil? You’re a low level familiar, open mouthed under the table of your masters.
2915 2018-08-20 17:58:10 素敵すぎます！b
2916 2018-08-20 17:58:06 Boredom plus oil perfume. 
2917 2018-08-20 17:57:41 He's got red in his eyes and joints coated in oil. Insides of steel, his left lung is so heavy, it could sink a canoe. 

The man is full of robot parts.

He wanted it this way. To be so strong, so perfect, that no one could hurt him.

It's kind of sad, but so damn #human. #vss365
2918 2018-08-20 17:57:30 i honestly been struggling w the same thing for the past 2 days . doc said I need antibiotics but i wasnt about that , so I been taking oregano oil , vitamin C & ginger tea w turmeric + rest w a high alkaline diet & im pretty sure itll be gone in a day or so . hope it helps u too
2919 2018-08-20 17:57:28 You’re changing the subject.  Your initial contention was that the funding provided by oil companies to climate skeptics exceeded that available to alarmists from government and universities. You’ve done nothing to back it or refute my contrary articles.
2920 2018-08-20 17:57:18 The DNC taking oil money pisses me off, but not enough to allow this republican travesty to continue. I'll vote dem and worry about the DNC later.
2921 2018-08-20 17:57:13 it’s just water, 1-2 drop of lavender essential oil (depending on how big of a batch u make), raw organic honey and a bit of lemon if u please !

2925 2018-08-20 17:56:42 I bet they have a play room. They buy coconut oil by the case on Amazon.
2926 2018-08-20 17:56:39 Yo @Jacobs_IRL, what's up with the palm oil in your cream crackers? It's flipping ruining the planet. Is there not enough oil on this side of the planet for yiz? #genuinequestion

2933 2018-08-20 17:55:58 Don t think the government would condemn it anyway What I needed as an ally in middle East and to keep oil prices reasonably low but it was an inhuman act by the strict Muslim Saudis
2934 2018-08-20 17:55:56 no, he suffocated his daughter and put them in some type of oil thing wher he worked they didnt say abt the mother tho she was 8mnths pregnant

Why you don`t speak to Maduros regime, like you go to North Korea?, which is 100times more dangerous than Venezuelan regime?.WE DON`T WANT AND INVASION. By  the way, EXXONDIGGIN OIL IN OUR ESEQUIBO!!!
2938 2018-08-20 17:55:36 He is incapable of retaining salt. Potato chips are the best vector for absorbing it - the oil and carbs helps absorption. He has to eat at least 20, twice a day.
2939 2018-08-20 17:55:34 I agree. She is way to pushy for his controlling behavior. Like oil and water. They don’t mix well
2940 2018-08-20 17:55:31 Why can't all these big oil companies write their programs to run on mac too instead of just Windows 
2941 2018-08-20 17:55:29 Can you kindly confirm the authenticity of the claim by caretaker minister that a huge oil well has been discovered by ExxonMobil in Balochistan? As CM, you must have the necessary info because that minister claimed that it was supposed to make Pak the 6th biggest oil producer!
2942 2018-08-20 17:55:25 Why do we always just get butter, flour, and oil? We need: meat, seafood, fruit, and chocolate!
2943 2018-08-20 17:55:24 I don't think that a lot of Nigerians don't know this TBH, at the base level they get its from oil sales - we're concerned about how the money is spent/shared. I think

2960 2018-08-20 17:53:18 The U.S. has slippery position of maintaining our way of life, pipe drilling into pristine areas, or taking from large reserves across a global scale.

Amazes and frustrates me to no end that so many people don’t seem to think about results. We have been selling oil to oil companies for years, and where has it gotten us? In debt to oil companies. How does this make sense?

2976 2018-08-20 17:50:42 Understandable. Coconut oil is one of the few oils I can use on my hair. Most oils are usually to heavy and weighs my hair down.
2977 2018-08-20 17:50:41 90% of people in the world chat: I have no oil what do I do to get no oil I'm out of oil

2980 2018-08-20 17:50:34 No matter how you count the GDP and employment numbers it's still a key industry. For example a downturn in oil price had the power to send Alberta into the biggest recession in a generation and federal and provincial balance sheets havent recovered, unemployment stubbornly high.

2990 2018-08-20 17:49:23 I believe we paid Iran £16000-00 for the countries oil rights circa 1905 when Churchill wanted Navy to use oil instead of coal. Later the mullahs realised they had been shafted and the trouble began. Iranian Oil,Anglo Dutch etc.

Akagi and Kaga are good but the game gives you plenty of great things to start with, burning oil on 3-4 runs shouldn't be a huge priority
2998 2018-08-20 17:48:51 Good thing Justin's giving us more oil pipelines this is going to help out
2999 2018-08-20 17:48:45 Wrong.  Socialists destroyed Venezuela.  Most of Venezuela oil exports to the US.  China and Other not so friendly countries to the US dumped billions $ into Venezuela.  Most of those $ billions did not put into good use, they were wasted. (Wasted is very nice word I used here)
3000 2018-08-20 17:48:34 while U.S. capital spending in oil and gas has increased 38 per cent in 2017 to $120 billion, Canadian investment has declined 56 per cent over three years (from $81 billion in 2014 to $45 billion in 2017).
3001 2018-08-20 17:48:33 @realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump,I find you`re brave when you defend your principals. As  Venezuelan`s 3rd year lady, I want to ask you, if you really are up to the oil reaches discovered in OUR ESEQUIBO which is being dig by EXXON in our Guyana. I notice people don`t realized the truth

3010 2018-08-20 17:47:29 Why are still giving big oil a subsidiary?
3011 2018-08-20 17:47:27 It is a parable, you may have may spiritual explanations
The message: foolish ones are not true believers, they accepted the Lord by their lips not in their hearts. The world was able to drain them from the word of God “oil”. They quickly distinguished the Holy Spirit inside them
3012 2018-08-20 17:47:25 Random thought. If #Venezuela has all this oil potential, why not dig for dinosaurs? #Argentina has a lot of specimens. Also, the ruins! There's more than just oil money in the ground... I would totally go to a Native Venezuelan/dinosaur museum.

3014 2018-08-20 17:47:13 Was it a repair shop or like a chain place: Midas, Jiffy Lube, etc 

An oil change shouldn’t cost more than 50. Add 20 for filters (if they are a more exp place). If it’s a chain I’d call their corporate office and get some $$ back. If it’s a shop: 1 review them.

3033 2018-08-20 17:45:03 It is a good job they have struck oil in 4 out of 4 wells. I tremble at the thought of what the share price would be if it hit a duster.

3038 2018-08-20 17:44:57 I don’t see education in Indonesia ever becoming secular unfortunately. And sanctions based on these grounds, also means sanctions on about the entire middle-east.

3039 2018-08-20 17:44:52 How hot is your water? optimum temp is 35 degrees... Make sure you use enough oil when you knead... knead for 8-10 mins. once it is risen, punch down, shape and let is rest for 30mins... If you want a crispy crust, place an ovenproof dish of water in the bottom of your oven

3046 2018-08-20 17:44:05 I don’t know what it is about me & car places, but JEEZ. Dropped my car off for an oil change at 9am since dad is making me take it somewhere rather than us doing it. They said “couple of hours” . I show up at 12:45 & they tell me 3 more hours. I can do this in 10 minutes...
3047 2018-08-20 17:44:04 You're going to have to qualify that "public ownership" statement. Unless you are referring to specific industry segments like oil, then that is a false statement. Yes, Norway's largest industry, oil, is 80% state operated, but that is not the country's overall economic model.

3058 2018-08-20 17:42:26 Haven't dug into the $CVSI chewing gum patents. The bull case is really the CBD oil, IMO, but the shadiness of management is what had me discount my valuation of it to $3-4 (hence, I wasn't so eager to chase it up).
3059 2018-08-20 17:42:13 I believe there is more to these oil deals than reported. 45 hired Tillerson at Putin's request. T. was the only stranger 45 hired. He had done a huge oil deal between Exxon and Rosneft & Putin. P. gave T. a special Russian medal. Obama shut that deal down. Oil is all Russia has.
3060 2018-08-20 17:42:05 But if you're an American coal or oil & gas company you can dump whatever toxic chemicals you want into our air and water, as long as you write a campaign check. That's how it works, right?
3061 2018-08-20 17:41:48 Next to dirt, the greatest danger to the engine of a car or truck is heat. Keeping your oil changed at recommended intervals is one way to protect the engine; the other is to have the radiator and cooling system inspected at least once a year.

3105 2018-08-20 17:36:43 Nah son invest in some quality olive oil. Then get that brand of Parmesan cheese
3106 2018-08-20 17:36:34 sigh... this makes YOUR products more expensive. 

In fact because of the steel tariffs we are now not able to buidl teh statewide oil pipeline here in Texas, and then that costs jobs.

3109 2018-08-20 17:36:21 It’s the one where Zack had a pet duck named Becky. She died in the oil spill. Zack gives a dramatic speech at the school board meeting where he sprays the oil co. guy with oil.
3110 2018-08-20 17:36:02 lol, lube oil & filter @ Jiffy Lube?
3111 2018-08-20 17:36:01 No one claimed that, theyre claiming that its happening much faster than it normally should which it is. 

Big oil hired FOX news to convince you otherwise, stop being a sheep.
3112 2018-08-20 17:35:50 When I was in 5th grade I was, I was in choir and i had heard somewhere that olive oil “lubricates” your throat and makes you sound better when you sing. So what I did was drink a cup of olive oil the day I had a concert and it actually worked.

Kale in the form of juice with a bunch other green vegetables is the exact opposite. 

Thank you for attending my food network show
3119 2018-08-20 17:34:24 You're right, Norway actually has higher rates of public ownership and much bigger state control over the economy. Contrary to the mythos, private industry boomed under Chavismo, the difference was that oil money was used to provide social necessities, build houses etc.
3120 2018-08-20 17:34:10 Production itself isn't bad per se but mass production on today's scale is dangerous no matter who owns the means of production. The industrial revolution was built on the backs of slaves and has ruined ecosystems but keep worshiping mass production until you're drinking oil

3169 2018-08-20 17:27:16 China will purchase oil from Iran using Iranian oil tankers to help Iran under US sanctions. European companies are ending their trade with Iran for fear of reprisals by US. That much for Europe’s willingness to stand by international agreements & justice.

3188 2018-08-20 17:24:17 India’s current account deficit (CAD) will widen to 2.5% of the GDP in the current fiscal due to the higher oil prices that has been accentuated by rupee depreciation, Moody’s said.

3199 2018-08-20 17:23:19 There is no way out. The economy is completely shut. The Oil pruduction is less than half. They dont know how to operate and maintain the machinery. No Joke. It is sad, a lot of good people there.

3208 2018-08-20 17:22:24 Funny, but with one of the biggest oil reserves in the world, you’d be surprised how much some countries think of Canada. Did you not see this hissy fit Saudi Arabia threw a few weeks ago? Put the puzzle together and don’t be so ignorant.

3218 2018-08-20 17:21:20 Geoff, just as our heavy oil artificial lift tech has been exported world wide, these kind of innovations will also be exported. We set the bar AND help others in the process. Not only that but, again, just like heavy, it creates jobs here as the tech grows and sells.
3219 2018-08-20 17:21:18 If you think fresh water is anywhere near the formations holding oil and gas, then you probably don't know anything about the industry.

Fracking is 99.5% sand/water. Why wouldn't the oil and gas itself be the concerning contaminant?

3237 2018-08-20 17:18:59 Wrong. Oil, gas, mining and quarrying COMBINED across the WHOLE country accounts for 9% of GDP. It's a main driver for AB GDP but still only about 5th or 6th in terms of employment.

Don't swallow the propaganda without checking.
3238 2018-08-20 17:18:58 $TLRY strong, the future of medical cannabis industry is going to be great. CBD oil is an obvious treatment for chronic anxiety. Not sure what the market size is but assume people on daily benzodiazepines should try to switch over it's such a bad option for anything but acute.
3239 2018-08-20 17:18:57 I use regular coconut oil instead of MCT and should call it "Double-Shot Stress Disaster" 50% of the time and for the disaster pants, normal Cappuccino or Latte holds the trophy for me ;)
3240 2018-08-20 17:18:51 Not much of a "crash" at all.  I'm beginning to think they know something we don't (at least as of now).  #OOTT
3241 2018-08-20 17:18:38 Savarkar was sentenced to 50 yrs of imprisonment This young barrister had to undergo unbearable physical torture in Andamans.He was yoked to d oil mill called  ' kolhu'.. due to sufferings and torture many persons committed suicide.After 12 yrs he was brought back. Now compare..
3242 2018-08-20 17:18:30 man at the oil change place gives me my receipt to “show my dad or whoever” lol how about give me the receipt for me.......???
3243 2018-08-20 17:18:28 Boycott Saudi Arabia...oh they don't make anythin...So every Western Kuntry ought to not buy their oil...
3244 2018-08-20 17:18:21 Increased water production does not imply a water drive. It  suggests that water is more mobile than oil with changing GOR.

3252 2018-08-20 17:17:27 I feel you bro its def a bitch in the beginning but it can be done ima tell you like the homies told me find some cbd oil and keep ya head up
3253 2018-08-20 17:17:27 The price of oil ought to included those costs.
3254 2018-08-20 17:17:27 good lord, that looks disgusting. just by looking at it i can imagine the amount of oil in those greasy dry looking things u call good.
3255 2018-08-20 17:17:17 There's a very fine line between the right amount of italian dressing and help me I'm drowning in oil + vinegar
3256 2018-08-20 17:17:09 That's a moot point. Was Nigeria the only oil-dependent country that experienced recession post oil price crash + significant oil production decline?
3257 2018-08-20 17:17:08 Qatar has been trying to unload that oil ownership ever since. I can't prove that 45 did get a broker fee but he doesn't work for free. Not one bit of evidence has come forward to dispute this. Waive $400 thou a year to shake down at half a billion a shot? I would.

3259 2018-08-20 17:17:03 Seems like a big deal if we just tapped the oil reserve $USO but only 11M Barrels $USO
3260 2018-08-20 17:16:54 All have palm oil.  Which is killing the orangutan and other animals.  

If you really love animals avoid this.

And then with his rich oil company friends at mara largo they all laugh and laugh.
3264 2018-08-20 17:16:31 Top of the hour: OIL 1H volatility clicks ON & is waxing up. The initial kick is lower, WATCH for  correction down to 1D 200MA area to find support.
NATGAS 1H honors 2.795 area resistance. 1D chart still has NOT properly corrected lower to make next move higher.
USD 1H test 200MA
3265 2018-08-20 17:16:14 Boiled yam and palm oil. A craving.

3267 2018-08-20 17:15:55 Dark chocolate, a hot pad, and some catnip oil are my recommendations.
3268 2018-08-20 17:15:50 I was talking about the ones “falling for” the snake oil. If you’ve extrapolated that to mean “nearly all”, I’ll bow to your greater expertise.

3279 2018-08-20 17:14:29 As you know, you can't get there at the moment. This is a tiding you by sort of action. I'm glad you stepped down from the alcohol. Next step weed to CBD oil. You'll find you can relieve anxiety without damaging your lungs, when you have the skills to deal with your thoughts.

3284 2018-08-20 17:13:58 What kind of rice are y’all cooking?? I’m Filipino & we eat jasmine rice. The ratio has always been 1:1 with NO oil. Water & rice is all you need. 
We’ve now switched over to medium grain (sushi) rice, because it’s cheaper than jasmine rice in our area, and the ratio is still 1:1
3285 2018-08-20 17:13:39 Oil up after emerging markets sell off
3286 2018-08-20 17:13:26 Obama had slapped severe sanctions on Russia for Crimea. Putin needed to sell oil to get reelected. Qatar paid $11B. Widely reported starting Dec 7, 16. The sale doesn't go through unless 45 waives sanctions. Trump campaigns hard so he gets a 10% cut or $500M of oil sale.
3287 2018-08-20 17:13:24 Na so like play like play na Yam and oil I go chop tomorrow. Baba God which way na

3291 2018-08-20 17:13:08 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3292 2018-08-20 17:13:07 @LeeCamp Old but new news on Mexico: Blackrock and Slim threatening AMLO to not stop new airport and to stop oil refinerys!!!  Can you make an article on this?
3293 2018-08-20 17:13:03 Puhleese...This claim is pure fiction "reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent."

They claim that 40% of the emissions associated with extractions and production of oil sands is from trucking the product to the production facility

That is patently absurd.
3294 2018-08-20 17:13:00 Me nko??

3296 2018-08-20 17:12:40 Weed was only criminalized and demonized due to the lobbying of the Rockerfellers and there co-horts, because they realized that everything that can be made from oil , can be made from hemp!
3297 2018-08-20 17:12:26 I didn't say the high oil prices were bad from Modi. That was one of the few good things.
3298 2018-08-20 17:12:15 Can’t wait to have a little diesel and not care about it and not have to put oil in it every week 
3299 2018-08-20 17:12:14 So you mean to say that these are just naysayings?.. That the abacha's loots, the abdulsalam, the babangida, the obasanjo, the saraki, the goodluck, the diezanni, the oil rich niger delta bunkering etc are all fallacies.
 Then we r blind.. I'm blind then so r u.
3300 2018-08-20 17:12:02 WHAT IS THE OIL????
3301 2018-08-20 17:11:55 No, Africa is rich in gold diamonds oil & other mined riches the world needs & wants. I saw a map once w/Africa divided into sections of what they had abundances of. Those ppl w/ALL the money control all of it. The Africans get squat!
3302 2018-08-20 17:11:51 Ok, even if CBD oil is made from the leaves and the stalks of the hemp plant and not the flowers, if you’re using CBD oil you aren’t considered straight edge sweetie. It’s still a cannabinoid even if you’re not technically high with CBD, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
3303 2018-08-20 17:11:31 Oil....Oil...Oil
3304 2018-08-20 17:11:21 #oott will pdvsa now be able to ramp up oil exports" Damage to the industry is massive. NO chance for production (hence exports) to ramp up in the next 5 years (optimistic), decline will continue. Reasons in next #'d tweets...
3305 2018-08-20 17:11:18 White killer got a peaceful interview to lie and act like he cared for his family when he knew they were in a Damn oil well. Black dude was probably in prison that night. No interview explaining himself.

3314 2018-08-20 17:09:56 PSA: don’t buy CBD products that just claim to have “Hemp Extract” or “Hemp Oil” in them. This is NOT CBD. It’s pure hempseed oil & contains almost no CBD. Ppl do this to get around CBD regulations & consumers don’t know the difference.

3318 2018-08-20 17:09:17 People eating “oil & sand” at churches. Whatever these pastors give to their congregants, they need to share with us.
For you to enter the kingdom, you have to eat sand? Really?
3319 2018-08-20 17:08:48 Thank you Hon. PM and Dharmendra Pradhanji for Rs 25 crores from Oil PSUs to kerala flood relief @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp
3320 2018-08-20 17:08:34 Yes because we will have many people volunteering to work high-risk jobs because they love to do it...because the definitely don’t take such jobs now because compensation is high.  High risk as in oil rig work, high rise power line work, etc.  Your ideals are in no way practical.
3321 2018-08-20 17:08:30 Asparagus only needs a grill, vegetable oil, and salt, and go well with basically any meat. Brussel sprouts are good roasted with a bit of butter, salt, pepper, and garlic, or if you feel like cheating sometimes, bacon wrapped, glazed in maple syrup, and roasted.

3323 2018-08-20 17:08:19 Once in Dhaka I was served the most beautiful mustard oil-and-fish salad (I guess some variant on the tiny fish bhorta?) formed into the shape of a hilsha, the fish it was made from—eyes and scales and gills and all.

3327 2018-08-20 17:08:08 I wish our standing dryer wasn’t broke, I need to give myself a hot oil treatment.
3328 2018-08-20 17:07:39 Great.  We are looking forward to keeping ourselves.....and our oil, gas, whisky, agriculture etc. We are invaluable to Westminster...that's why they begged us not to leave. Comments like yours make it an easy choice though. Cheerio. 
3329 2018-08-20 17:07:26 my dad showed me how to check the oil in my old car, i wish he would’ve shown me how to put air in my tires 
3330 2018-08-20 17:07:12 Yeah. Now, asking ppl to use graduated cylinders for liquid measurement would be excessive. But fun. Let's titrate this oil into the mixture 
3331 2018-08-20 17:06:59 @TheBodyShop i LOVE ur brand & am leaving a 5-star review on tea tree oil on your site right now but....it's asking my gender? and the only two options are male and female? There's not even a "prefer not to answer" option which I see on many other sites. Feels weird.

3334 2018-08-20 17:06:45 It depends on the oil you're using.
3335 2018-08-20 17:06:36 I have mimosa trees, too! And, I have my patchouli oil from the 70s! I still wear it every once in a while. Once, a well dressed man, complete stranger stopped when he passed me and told me that smell was going to get me kidnapped!

3337 2018-08-20 17:06:11 APC? Votes? Its like oil and water; a party that has destroyed the little gains we have made in our electoral process talks of votes...wat u need in 2019 is a party dat can match ur thuggery.

3340 2018-08-20 17:05:50 THIS. JUST. DOESNT. MAKE. ANY. SENSE. Even if it did, what is the goal if this sensationalized headline? Was the entire supply chain tallied for oil and gas? Add up all 5 oil and gas companies and make that comparison. This "reporting" is a joke, not journalism.

3354 2018-08-20 17:04:09 The green energy is all apart of this however the oil and gas sector in the west is the largest driver of this countries economy.

3355 2018-08-20 17:04:09 Sir, in your opinion what is the solution to Venezuela mess? Obviously socialism needs to end. But how they will survive with low oil prices.
3356 2018-08-20 17:04:02 The only thing that keeps them in power is all that wealth and oil. They keep the world's financial market afloat and control the masses with a stranglehold of fear by their outdated, ancient religion. Otherwise, nobody would put up with their backward shit for a second.

3359 2018-08-20 17:03:41 impossible to have infinite oil on finite planet. 50 years oil/gas left but does not consider population growth or rising costs to extract. So 30 years is more likely. no more cheap oil or gas are left on the planet. @tesla 30 years pretty soon! if Mars oil then $50K+ per barrel

3368 2018-08-20 17:02:31 The real crime is you paid $200 for an oil change. I hope there was like a brake replacement in there too.
3369 2018-08-20 17:02:31 Now south of the border we need local voice when it comes to 'palm oil plantations' AKA housing estates blighting the countryside and compromising the local RoW system.

3372 2018-08-20 17:02:04 Sounds good, will give it a go.  Does the vinegar/water mix emulsify at all with the oil?
3373 2018-08-20 17:01:36 And inflation was low because of low crude oil prices. Now that crude oil prices are firming up, inflation is also going up. 
Plus the rupee has never been over 70 for the dollar. 
Real rural wages are declining or stagnant. In all respects Modi is a failure on economics

3378 2018-08-20 17:01:22 Which one do you like? I still haven’t found a really good and good for you vegan cheese. Daiya is terrible and has Canola oil in it which is no bueno. Others use it too. It’s like the one thing vegans still haven’t figured out quite yet.
3379 2018-08-20 17:01:02 Oil is free too. As is gas. It's not the products that costs the money, it's the developers who harness it and want a return for their outlay.

We kept being told "..wind is free..." but when we pointed out that energy costs kept going up the developers denied ever saying it!

3389 2018-08-20 17:00:08 There’s not even an infinite amount of oil. Assuming that no more is being made (and as far as I know, the conditions for making oil no longer exist on earth) then we are stuck with the remains of what we once had and by definition therefore the amount of oil is finite.

3406 2018-08-20 16:58:33 Always a concern to me that there is never any long term thinking.  We should look decades down the line, not just a couple.  Oil will always be important, but why not do our best to ensure enough for the future?  Conservation never hurts.

3478 2018-08-20 16:49:07 So we are left with the question. Is the increasing overall water cut a sign of depletion and water encroachment from an underlying aquifer or is it a function of newer completion practices that lead to higher water cut (but much higher oil rate) wells?

3494 2018-08-20 16:46:56 Meaning what? In what was has the oil discovered off the landmass of Scotland not supported the UK economy?
3495 2018-08-20 16:46:53 Regarding oil companies and the knowledge that they have about PDVSA, I think the only way is with a guarantee, with enough liquidity and free of legal actions by others. I don’t think they will be willing to go back to VENEZUELA. Perhaps the Saint Croix refinery is on the table.
3496 2018-08-20 16:46:53 With militias fighting at ports and oil export disruptions, many shipowners shun transportation of Libyan oil cargoes. This raises the premiums of freights on Libyan routes by up to 10 points on the so-called Worldscale(freightrate)

3499 2018-08-20 16:46:37 Our behavior dictates to the world who we are. As we represent our Lord, may the people HE allows us to come in contact with, feel HIS love and see HIS light as the oil of HIS glory flows through us as HE is glorified, IJN.
3500 2018-08-20 16:46:33 So you want us to nationalize the industry like very other major oil exporting nation has done? I'm in

3504 2018-08-20 16:45:50 Earlier this week, Libya’s crude oil production exceeded 1 million bpd for the first time since June, when port blockades and a kidnapping caused production outages that within a month brought production to as little as 670,000 bpd.
3505 2018-08-20 16:45:32 I love the @josie_maran argon oil face wash so much. Whenever I run out and don’t immediately go repurchase, I always REGRET it. It has been a month since I ran out and my skin is NOT HAPPY with what I’ve been using in its stead
3506 2018-08-20 16:45:30 Are you aware of the $200million Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCI Fund) which can be accessed by companies operating in the Oil and Gas Industry?
3507 2018-08-20 16:45:29 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
3508 2018-08-20 16:45:27 It's as if the economic carnage in Venezuela is just Maduro's cock-up or even an act of god.

Why has the income from oil exports dwindled? We know people are fleeing to the south, but there are reasons for inadequate availability of goods.

3529 2018-08-20 16:44:02 Do you ever announce programs to actually create wealth, instead of just redistributing it?  Seriously,  U run nearly $20 billion budget deficits at a time when USA economy is on fire, oil prices are good and world GDP growth is positive ... Recession ahead

1. It's almost autumn which means THE LIMITED EDITION PUMPKIN SPICE BODY OIL & BROWN SUGAR SCRUB WILL BE BACK SOON. SO YOU CAN ONCE AGAIN SHAMELESSLY INDULGE IN SMELLING LIKE A PIE.
3543 2018-08-20 16:42:02 Social media is the new oil..... It makes things fleek and functional. That's why I never care for my 1rt because that's still a message past on
3544 2018-08-20 16:41:42 I doubt if it needs to be presented to the FEC. The SIWP is a collection of interventions from different agencies of the  FG and oil companies. They were already approved in their respective ministries. SIWP is a framework for the implementation of those projects.
3545 2018-08-20 16:41:34 Father and Uncle have terminal cancer. The amount of propaganda videos for cannabis that we've been sent is overwhelming. They seem like snake oil vultures trying to capitalise on other's misery.

3561 2018-08-20 16:40:01 Why? Oil. Divest now.

3571 2018-08-20 16:39:14 You don’t know why they chose external borrowing instead of internal? Did you not see the internal debt reduced? Also didn’t you see the previous govt increased external by almost 100% despite the highest oil boom in history? Side by side, this govt has been more prudent
3572 2018-08-20 16:39:10 don’t wanna get up to get this damn oil change )-:
3573 2018-08-20 16:39:02 You skipped the part where Democrats rigged a primary election so they could continue to do the same things. And they just lifted a ban on OIL LOBBY MONEY. Any Dem taking OIL $$ and blowing the climate change horn deserves to LOSE.

3585 2018-08-20 16:36:25 Be happy with it (probably demand land with more oil or gas attached) & other Syrians may not be happy with that. Where does it end. If you’re in the minority you either have to get on with the majority or move to another suitable country if you want to live a strict lifestyle.
3586 2018-08-20 16:36:23 Might want to rethink that.  Organic lard has much of the same nutritional benefits as coconut oil, olive and no trans fats.  Better for you than canola, sunflower, grapeseed/rapeseed, safflower oils by far.
3587 2018-08-20 16:36:20 Most of Thatcher's policies were paid for by the sale of our North Sea oil reserves, sale of council houses, etc. That's what enabled her to cut the top rate of tax (to 60%. It's now 45%). She also cut income tax too ofc, but offset that by increasing VAT.

3589 2018-08-20 16:35:58 and there is an expectation of transparency and proper management. The issue for Venezuela arose when oil prices collapsed and it’s difficult to take away social programs when people already enjoy them, accompanied with the fact that Chavez was seen as a hero and could have...

3592 2018-08-20 16:35:29 But if it doesn't work, it's not medicine, it's snake oil  Case in point cannabis oil, yesterday alternative, anecdotal evidence, studies done, today mainstream.
3593 2018-08-20 16:35:29 She certainly looks a threat to a corrupt bloodthirsty war criminal, unfortunately the Saudi prince has enough oil to purchase the moral fibre of corrupt western governments like the UK and USA.

3596 2018-08-20 16:35:25 coconut oil is a scam.
3597 2018-08-20 16:35:20 To say Venezuela’s collapse is solely due to socialism is lazy and relatively incorrect. Much of it has to do with mismanagement of its natural resources. Yes, Chavez pumped a lot of the revenue from oil at a time of high prices to programs for the poor...

3642 2018-08-20 16:30:45 On the subject. I read an article in The Farmer's Almanac about Snake Oil.

3693 2018-08-20 16:25:12 Oddly enough, countries with market economies don't seem to have that trouble. Norway is a market economy (yes, it is) with a lot of oil, but their economy is one of the best in the world. Singapore, Hong Kong, Ireland all poor on natural resources; all among the richest.

3707 2018-08-20 16:23:54 Just went to get my oil changed, last time I had it done was September 2017. I tried to holdout a few more weeks to make it a year but I just hit the 3,000 mark and got nervous. This is a sign that I truly hate leaving the house.

3709 2018-08-20 16:23:40 We did have one some years back, took out an apartment building if I remember correct. However, if oil or LNG was transported by rail, the stories would be much worse.
3710 2018-08-20 16:23:37 Its one side and its running. My chest was hurting and throat was scratchy last night but i put some peppermint oil in my water and rubbed my chest and throat down and that went away.....so idk

3716 2018-08-20 16:22:33 The company is under the strictest supervision by the regulators ever imposed.
One has to wonder how they've managed to do all the things the protestors claim. Not that the protestors seem to have any real knowledge ie depth of aquifier, construction of an oil well, etc.

3720 2018-08-20 16:22:11 The crud we used to eat, and to think we were all convinced this was fine dining. When I lived on The Isle of Dogs back in the 90s, I asked a bloke in ASDAs where I could find the olive oil. He said "Olive oil? We don't even sell brown bread in here."

3748 2018-08-20 16:18:06 That was a quick retreat from "Venezuela proves socialism is bad" to "oil dependence is the real problem."

3751 2018-08-20 16:17:57 By the way, I spoke of the oil sharing model because I think it is this philosophy which is writ large and touches on the entire civil service, the political class, and even the people. It is at the core of our anti-capitalist dispositions.

3796 2018-08-20 16:12:51 @crudereporter Oil price trajectory, technically driven:  very short-term bounce (to $68.7), then reversal and break of $64.64, with a test of $55/b.  That will hold, followed by a strong move to retest $75.  Higher thereafter.

3798 2018-08-20 16:12:48 Venezuela is run completely different than how Bernie would run it. The reason their economy is trash has nothing to do with Socialism, but with faulty leadetship and too much of a reliance on oil. Plus, it’s an oppressive dictatorship, which never helps

3803 2018-08-20 16:12:10 by doing agricultural reforms , we can decrease import  of cooking oil to a greater extent
3804 2018-08-20 16:12:04 Nope, that is fish oil in a bottle

Canada has 169 billion barrels of oil in reserve if we assume price of each barrel of oil as of today is $67. That means, 1100 trillion-dollar industry waiting for us to use to DEVELOP.
3820 2018-08-20 16:10:40 Bush was in the oil business.  Your argument:  "OMG when he was Prez the secret service drove cars and flew in airplanes that  burn fuel made from crude oil!!!  See...he profited!!!!"  LOL 
3821 2018-08-20 16:10:36 Now people will think rich New Yorkers aren't so smart -- I mean how could they sit through that?  It makes absolutely no sense!! (someone should point out that if no one wants energy that has to be subsidized, then the oil refineries would be shut down.)
3822 2018-08-20 16:10:34 Spent 15 years as a commercial construction project manager and now am a contract analyst/administrator in the utility side of oil and gas.  Got my MA in the midst of all!
3823 2018-08-20 16:10:20 Venezuela in desperation, is introducing economic reforms that may drive up the price of oil as a massive financial crisis grips it,as oil output has dropped below the 1947 levels of 1.3M barrels per day.

3827 2018-08-20 16:10:11 of course you guys don't want to loose your jobs & culture, so if its about that, i can understand that. but if we as humanity don't change our ways, we will pretty much ALL be fucked, oil & non-oil people alike.

3829 2018-08-20 16:09:59 If TransCanada had seen the oil prices rising instead of crashing, I have not doubt they would have maintained progress on the Energy East project in spite of regulatory change.
3830 2018-08-20 16:09:58 Sir...photographs are so gauche. In keeping with Wilson tradition, Young Amber and Soccer Boy will have their nuptials memorialized in a series of oil paintings. And perish the thought of any hooligan shenanigans or athletic contrivances at such a auspicious occasion.
3831 2018-08-20 16:09:57 French energy giant #Total has officially quit its multi-billion-dollar gas project in Iran, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said on Monday, following the reimposition of US sanctions. AFP
3832 2018-08-20 16:09:54 Woke up to a giant zit above my upper lip this morning. I dabbed some tea tree oil on it and rushed to my appointment. Just checked to see that it has reduced in size and I thought of you @Pr1y3 Lol.  How is your skin?
3833 2018-08-20 16:09:48 So you know how to go over there because the deductibility is so much oil?
3834 2018-08-20 16:09:44 How we have a normalised relationship with that country is beyond me.
I don't care how many weapons we sell to them, how much oil we might buy, what a lovely time Prince Charles has with them all. On the most basic level of humanity they are utterly bankrupt.
3835 2018-08-20 16:09:43 Spending exploded and government thought price control would tame inflation. Plus running massive fiscal deficit plus low oil prices price mishandling of pevdsa resulting in lower out put plus massive foreign debt... all exploded

3839 2018-08-20 16:09:13 Dah beli Lavendar Essential Oil, moga segala perasaan kusut, perasaan yg tak tentu hala dan sebagainya dapat dikurangkan sikit demi sedikit. I need my old life back! 
3840 2018-08-20 16:08:59 If you have any essential oils use some Lavender soothes the burns and helps heal the burn and some Frankincense helps with reducing any scarring and Tea Tree oil helps reduce infections from burns.
3841 2018-08-20 16:08:59 That was just the period style. There was full employment in the 50's and 60's. That is why west indians, pakistanis, indians came here to work. UK produced more cars than we do now. People could walk out of a job and into another. The 70's were bad after OPEC trippled oil prices
3842 2018-08-20 16:08:54 Irving can't process bitumen fr AB & SK in their refinery. Means Saudi Venezuela & Nigerian sources continue 30K bpd Coker which processes oil sands cost approx $1.5 billion. Irving has never publicly committed to buy new unit if Energy East was approved - no energy independence

3850 2018-08-20 16:08:23 @Walmart just told me it would be 2 hours for an oil change... there's literally no one working, they're all standing around. Yet, they have the audacity to bitch about being underpaid.
3851 2018-08-20 16:08:22 let me tell you, mix a v v small amount of coconut oil into a bottle of baby soap wash 2–3 times a day and wala
3852 2018-08-20 16:08:18 And what makes it worse is that, they are doing so in a tragic scenario when lakhs are left homeless. They are literally burning their oil on their own compatriots tragedy.
3853 2018-08-20 16:08:18 In July 2018 Venezuela Oil Production reached 1,52 Kb/d (-17 Kbd). Faja (+6Kbd); West (-16Kkb); East (-6Kbd) @mariannaparraga @fmonaldi @aroliveros
3854 2018-08-20 16:08:13 See oil changes not for women to get because they start talking all this extra shit of what needs to be changed like sir you speaking another language
3855 2018-08-20 16:07:50 Businesses in the old tech should see the writing on the wall and pivot.  We're already seeing this with some oil companies. Keeping the old and inefficient around for the sake of jobs is not progress.

3863 2018-08-20 16:07:24 yes, but coal, wind, solar, bagasse aren't and indexing reduces magnitude of oil price shock as well due to more efficient RLNG plants, to put it crudely, producing more MWs per 'barrel'
3864 2018-08-20 16:07:23 Great work, we love the sustainable palm oil page on your website  Thanks for spreading the word to consumers 
3865 2018-08-20 16:06:51 Stop taking unnecessary carbs and sugar. Instead eat real food like meat, coco oil, olives, eggs, avokado… Be aware of what you put into your fuel tank!
3866 2018-08-20 16:06:47 That's simply not true. The Obama administration declared Venezuela an “extraordinary threat to the national security” of the US, (except for oil) in order to levy sanctions against individual Venezuelan leaders. That was in 2015.

3885 2018-08-20 16:04:59 so i went to go get my oil changed & this boy who took my payment wanted my number soooo bad, he gave me a discount and some car air fresheners .
3886 2018-08-20 16:04:38 being an adult means getting your oil changed on time and not 6 months late
3887 2018-08-20 16:04:35 Nuclear energy is better than oil, coal and gas, but at this point that simply won't cut it. The options are 100% renewables and significant reductions in production/consumption, or temperatures above 2 degrees over preindustrial levels which = extinction.

3926 2018-08-20 15:59:58 It's always about the oil. Twisted mentality.
3927 2018-08-20 15:59:52 if u guys would tell me: yes, drilling is a risky activity and even without that risk there is the problem of climate change, but the plain fact is that the world is still pretty much addicted to oil & gas. - i would say: ok, thats not controversial. so where do we go from here?
3928 2018-08-20 15:59:37 Ok so #coconut oil is poison.
3929 2018-08-20 15:59:35 Try to draw a line of cause and effect between nationalised oil and the hyperinflation, then tell me how ‘socialist’ policy caused it, then look at the mountains of very obvious evidence for right-wing agitators in-country
3930 2018-08-20 15:59:21 It gets better. Try using tea tree oil and probiotics. BC messed me up. It’s not worth it at all.

3953 2018-08-20 15:56:40 Or you face it down and wait for the oil to drip
3954 2018-08-20 15:56:33 It’s actually pretty incredible that they haven’t been invaded yet. They have the world’s largest oil reserves, even if most of it is out of reach.
3955 2018-08-20 15:56:32 Don’t schedule anything during football season... you putting this holy oil on my momma head and praying for 30 min. You know Bama and LSU in a deadlock. What’s wrong with you

3957 2018-08-20 15:56:23 And quite rightly there shouldn't be.

The Tories fully opened EU Pandora's box pandering to the far right of their party then proceeded to sell snake oil lies to a UKIP primed electorate full of EU hate.

They should be left to deal with the consequences, including Indyref2.

3961 2018-08-20 15:55:57 Premiums are there to protect you against the big stuff that happens. Kind of like car insurance. You don't get car insurance for oil changes, but for when your car gets totaled in a wreck or such.

3967 2018-08-20 15:55:36 Most importantly, most farmers I've talked to say they make a lot more from the lease than from the row crops that would be there. Same reason so many oil wells got put in on farms down south in the 20th century... More money for the farmer, and a more reliable income steam too.
3968 2018-08-20 15:55:03 Yes-I hear you talk about school exp +agree. I'm back in schools after being lucky enough to take 20 yrs off to raise my kids. What's glaringly different now? Many more behavior/attention issues +Pract. EVERY child has some kind of sugar/veg oil combo for snack+lunch

okay so, intolerance update! I don't think I am reacting to pasta, or coconut oil based cheese? I felt mostly fine this morning, apart from a lingering headache which seems to have gone now

but might be reacting to onions?? fml I love onions
4044 2018-08-20 15:46:20 You have to be exceptionally stupid to believe the corrupt guys, who over the course of many years, drove your resource-rich state to bankruptcy, are the only ones who can fix it with benefits and gifts for oil and mining and extreme austerity for you.

That would be around a 6000% markup.
4058 2018-08-20 15:45:19 Fun fact: American dependence on the Middle East for oil is largely a political myth. Saudi Arabia is only our #4 largest provider, I believe.

4081 2018-08-20 15:42:21 "Exclusive: China shifts to Iranian tankers to keep oil flowing amid U.S. sanctions" - 6 hours ago -Reuters

Sanctions usually cause trade patterns and partners to re-align, and they are often futile for this reason. A prime example outlined in my book, Cuba Under Embargo.
4082 2018-08-20 15:42:18 Well today is an expensive day. Vet visit, oil change, filled up my tank, paid for 6 personal training sessions, and bought my niece a birthday present. :')
4083 2018-08-20 15:42:14 So many people crave the quick fix and they always will. I bet I could literally sell snake oil to people today in 2018 and they would eat it up without seeing the irony.

4085 2018-08-20 15:42:06 AK Republicans are so single minded and stupid.

4092 2018-08-20 15:41:37 Never found any use for EIA DPR except total production estimate which then must be discounted to exclude production from other reservoirs w/in tight oil counties. Looks like "legacy" prod follows dip in total prod 2015-16 so is probably a bulk shift rather than real data.

4106 2018-08-20 15:40:20 the REAL inconvenient Truth is that most of the oil is used by... the MILITARY.

4110 2018-08-20 15:40:10 Bigger picture with the U.S. trade war with China, Trump will demand an oil embargo against China, Isolating both Cn. & China to the point of rallying the U.S. to re-instate the "Manifest Destiny Bill". The republicans us war to get re-elected. Because it works for them. History.
4111 2018-08-20 15:39:51 The majority of Americans did not vote for guy. The majority of Americans as well as the entire planet ,lsee right through this clarnival barking snake oil salesmen. Trump drones hate the press cuz they shed light on darkness. Thats why Trumpiesvsay truth is not truth.
4112 2018-08-20 15:39:48 actually U dont sub us we pay more per head than england does& only get a minimum amount bck but we shld get far more seeing that our oil rev gets wasted by ukgov & they have no clue how to sort accounts but dont let that get in the way of the lies. why do you think we want indy?

4115 2018-08-20 15:39:30 Shit smile would just make this worse. I put some peppermint oil on my neck and made some coffee
4116 2018-08-20 15:39:28 In times of uncertainty, mkts go risk off. This is not the same as going negative. Crude, at the moment, as indicated by COT, is risk off, with longs trimming, but shorts remaining stable. Oil is caught between "trade wars > EM weakness = reduced demand" to PdVSA+IR supply drop
4117 2018-08-20 15:39:21 Almost forgotten how wonderful bio oil is although it's not the best oil that I've tried. New scars are healed within 5 days

4157 2018-08-20 15:33:47 I further disagree that turmeric needs to be added for right flavours. The perfect flavour of Haakh is based on the smoked flavour of Mustard oil. Whole chillies post it's cooked and with a lid on for 5 mins is far better adds much better flavour.

4160 2018-08-20 15:33:39 Québec also has oil and chose to keep it in the ground.

And luck has nothing to do with it, when you consider that Québec developped alone its hydro network in the 60s and 70s, with no help from Ottawa and Ottawa is now helping Muskrat Falls with 5G$... so... luck?

4183 2018-08-20 15:30:22 Electricity has the potential to be produced sustainably genius. Oil does not. Lots of muscle and no brain?
4184 2018-08-20 15:30:21 Venezuela has the oil & SA has the minerals so what happened 2 Venezuela? Can’t blame sanctions 4 the collapse & it’s the very same system & country that EFF is inspired by & considers 2b successful. No matter how many times you rewind the movie Titanic, the ship will always sink
4185 2018-08-20 15:30:21 UN already reported that isis is selling oil in areas supposed to be under American control.
4186 2018-08-20 15:30:21 If America wants to minimize Venezuelan inflation we should import their oil exclusively, export our domestic reserves, and break the middle east cartel.

4190 2018-08-20 15:29:42 But never mind that,  @realDonaldTrump's issues with Iran are causing oil prices to rise and Venezuela is no longer in a position to redress the balance. I think Tories are about to find out, just how much an increase in oil prices will have on the economy.
4191 2018-08-20 15:29:40 Off the Charlesswan oil
4192 2018-08-20 15:29:27 The fucking oil truck pulled up outside and it sounded like the UPS truck, I am livid... 
4193 2018-08-20 15:28:55 Yeah just boil until you can poke through with a fork and there's not much resistance. Then empty it out of the pot and make sure the potatoes are dry or you're gonna have oil flying around your house. Having them cool a bit is a good idea too
4194 2018-08-20 15:28:55 Yeah, because the already wealthy adherents of fossil fuels would NEVER steal millions from taxpayers while  oil spills abound. And she calls MSM propaganda!?!? Lol
4195 2018-08-20 15:28:51 BS mental health awareness campaigns usually want to conflate mental health with stress in the hope that it can repair its faulty machines (labour force) with oil (therapy).

4200 2018-08-20 15:28:23 Agree.
Media coverage on rapist killing was terrible & unfair! Also shocking was the coverage given the white fool who killed his wife & 2 young daughters. Media spoke of financial problems as if it's ok to kill your family if you're in debt. Bodies were found submerged in oil.

4212 2018-08-20 15:27:25 I will be off home soon for some slow cooked Ragu (Italian) or Ragout (French)with pasta (Italian) with some rapeseed oil, salt (Welsh), pepper (Java) and some Parmesan (Italian). I cannot say how stupid and mis-guided this culinary cultural appropriation nonsense is. So there.
4213 2018-08-20 15:27:20 Always thought it was just a whipped eggs and oil emulsion. Acid/Vinegar makes it even less appealing.
4214 2018-08-20 15:27:16 It's time we start talking about our hypocritical economic values we are shipping coal everyday massive amounts to markets to burn that are causing global warming as well as all the dirty oil Canada is creating
4215 2018-08-20 15:27:01 Canada to collaborate with Europe on waste-to-energy biomass technology to help eliminate the importation of crude oil. @CanadianPM @wartsilacorp @HitachiGlobal
4216 2018-08-20 15:27:01 The saddest part to me is how rich Venezuela could be if they all weren’t so focused on stealing from each other. Countries like Bolivia don’t much stand a chance. But Venezuela has EVERYTHING!  Oil, agriculture, smart people, ports. They just destroy it with socialist greed.
4217 2018-08-20 15:27:00 Find out where you stay and act like we found some oil nigga

4219 2018-08-20 15:26:42 Agreed, the rule in it's current standing is trash. Better option: NFLPA and the league come together to construct a rule that both sides can live with and limits potential for future lawsuits on this issue. Not happening, as these 2 sides might as well be oil and vinegar.
4220 2018-08-20 15:26:41 this baby oil got me so greasy
4221 2018-08-20 15:26:36 Could be too much oil — 1 cup of rice with 1 tsp of salt & 2 tbsp of oil & 1 & 3/4 water
4222 2018-08-20 15:26:35 Sadly, the list of innocuous, accessible, legal things with dubious medical claims is long: essential oils, coconut oil, vinegar, green tea, grapefruit, essential oils, vitamin C, vitamin B12, pretty much any vitamin, did I mention essential oils?
4223 2018-08-20 15:26:35 Have an 11:30 appointment to get my oil changed. Last two times I had to wait an hour before they got started! Hopefully today will be better!

4227 2018-08-20 15:25:31 1. Oil comprises 95% of Venezuela's exports and 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP)  2. during the second half of 2014, a severe DROP in oil prices caused the "Bolivar" currency system in Venezuela to crumble.Tories making statements should be treated with a big pinch of salt

4255 2018-08-20 15:21:17 Read... Out of greed and fear, capitalists set about sabotaging Venezuela, oil companies and pro-capitalist governments collaborated to crash the price of oil, Venezuela’s main source of income. As a result, their economy has collapsed, and the consequence is what we see today.
4256 2018-08-20 15:21:06 In 2016, China imported $228 billion worth of integrated circuits—more than it spent on imported oil
4257 2018-08-20 15:20:57 I’m actually enjoying waiting for my oil to be changed because I think this is the first time I’ve actually gotten to sit down and do nothing in over a month.
4258 2018-08-20 15:20:47 Fracking technology changed the oil equation and extended the opportunities for extracting oil from sandy soil. There was a huge effort to develop that in the 1990s and 2000s. Technology is also the solution to climate change too, just as it was the cause of it.

4269 2018-08-20 15:19:39 True, the North Sea, Inc. Norwegian sector, were exposed as a very high cost area to produce oil from, hence why 60,000 odd jobs were lost in the UK alone when the price crashed. As for the oil fund, it is all either on paper or invested internationally; vulnerable to devaluing.
4270 2018-08-20 15:19:31 Nope, it is because the oil producers will make less money, and media companies are sponsored by them, in fact, without a global need to drive oil demand there would not be media companies like @CNN

4295 2018-08-20 15:16:17 So are you gearing up your base for an invasion of Venezuela? That's one way to get at their oil. A little too transparent, however. It's a sovereign country. Try to remember that.
4296 2018-08-20 15:16:17 Financial mismanagement by an autocratic regime.  Also the market flooded with Saudi oil to artificially lower gas prices (probably with US incentive), limiting Venezuelas economic potential to bounce back from said mismanagement

4330 2018-08-20 15:11:27 Do you really compare Venezuela with the EU?
V has never had any relevant economic values besides oil. The EU has very few oil, but a lot of economic and human assets.
4331 2018-08-20 15:11:13 They are also not under extreme international sanctions for everything except oil.

4344 2018-08-20 15:09:49 misusing oil reserves? Exactly how is he misusing them? He's actually using them to subsidize just about every basic household item in the whole country, otherwise most people wouldn't be able to afford it.

4352 2018-08-20 15:08:50 If it isn't broken, don't fix it.  Corn oil was an invention of the 20th-century agribusiness complex.  We didn't need it then and we don't need it now.  Especially when we know the highly inflammatory and disruptive nature of its high Omega 6 profile.

4354 2018-08-20 15:08:42 @fmmsdngr Research reveals that oil endowed countries' political leaders tend to count themselves lucky for one reason: huge financial benefits but on the other hand, the communities wallow in underdevelopment. #CleanUpNigerDelterNow @BrigGen50 @LawalAmodu
4355 2018-08-20 15:08:38 Wasn't this based on the rats eating primarily Crisco and corn oil? I'm pretty sure their risk of cancer and every disease risk goes up on a diet like that.

4373 2018-08-20 15:06:51 China, seeking to skirt U.S. sanctions, will use oil tankers from Iran for its purchases of that country's crude, throwing Tehran a lifeline while European companies such as France's Total are walking away due to fear of reprisals from Washington.
4374 2018-08-20 15:06:45 Sufficient is the fact to say that although Buhari's forte isn't strong economic policies, Nigeria was already doomed for recession by the time he took over. Check all countries that are heavily reliant on oil as revenue, most of them went into recession too.

4397 2018-08-20 15:04:34 Lol. GEJ wasn't responsible for drop in oil price. Rather, oil prices were largely favourable during his tenure. Unfortunately, our reserves didn't reflex this. So when oil prices went down, there was no defence... That was what Buhari inherited.

4406 2018-08-20 15:03:00 There isn't. There's a big difference between "oil" and "recoverable oil" (and light sweet vs heavy sour, for that matter). There's also the Achilles heel mentioned before: conservatives are diametrically opposed to state ownership and would sell it.

Bring to a boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat to low, cover, simmer for 15 ms until carrots are very soft.
Remove & discard cinnamon stick & cloves. Serve.

4619 2018-08-20 14:38:53 I second what you say. 
An independent Scotland can join the EU for sure, but it may need some additional help.
The key issue is -just like 2014- how to account for the North Sea Oil revenues. The UK will not give those up like that. And the nuclear subs.

4621 2018-08-20 14:38:40 It surprises me that it is that low, with 47% of Conventional Natural Gas and 90% of Colorado’s Oil Production. The Spill report used to be done every week in the "A" section , then disappeared, then brought back in a supplemental section. Hmmm
4622 2018-08-20 14:38:33 True the US overthrew Iran’s democratic president in 1953 and put in place a puppet dictator in order to take the oil there
4623 2018-08-20 14:38:23 I hate hunting too, but if we really cared about wildlife then consider the devastating impact that our use of palm oil, coffee and cocoa have and is having on forests and wildlife. Bombs not single rifle shots! We are all guilty!

4625 2018-08-20 14:38:12 To be fair, a country with $90b in oil revenue probably can’t end up w a balance of payments crisis. A country that expects $90bn and ends up with a third of that most certainly can. The most glaring problem with this analysis was that it didn’t reckon with oil mismanagement.

a small bunch of scallions, a leek, or a bunch of chives

4668 2018-08-20 14:33:58 @cathmckenna start by stoping oil production and pipelines. Picking up plastic is good, but it is not "beating plastic pollution". Please explain how an oil spill on that beach will be cleaned up. Some environment minister you are, SHAME!

4711 2018-08-20 14:30:17 Price controls and other regulations are a consequence of the economic collapse of Venezuela. Before the collapse, regulations were not there. Years ago in the era of high oil prices, the "socialist" government mostly stayed out of the way of private business

4729 2018-08-20 14:28:40 Venezuela stole millions from the US in their socialist nationalization movement. They said it would bring profit to the people. Instead, they did not know what they were doing and now all the oil mining equipment is ruined. Government never knows best.

4747 2018-08-20 14:26:42 Yes We buy oil from the Saudi but EU should stand with Canada
We can not allow to be controlled by the need of oil & let the Arab countries to blackmail international politics & get obscenely rich
We must move to renewable  energy
fuck the Arab oil
today technologies can do it

4757 2018-08-20 14:26:19 That is indeed possible and I’d say more likely. I personally don’t buy the narrative of a near-complete shutdown of Iranian #oil exports. But I’ve been wrong lotsa times.
4758 2018-08-20 14:26:18 I once said that some of the so called SALAD COOKING OIL IS FAKE!
4759 2018-08-20 14:26:16 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
4760 2018-08-20 14:26:16 They hold down the federal gas tax to prevent us from wanting more fuel efficient cars and repeal increases in cafe standards to the oil companies can sell more oil. The business interest won: dismantled unions drive down wages eliminated benefits = reagan agenda
4761 2018-08-20 14:26:10 Too bad Puerto Rico doesn't have crude oil so that you could be concerned for those AMERICAN CITIZENS!

4768 2018-08-20 14:24:47 Is this considered a recycling process or recovery process? considering that the resulting "oil" may be burnt for energy.
4769 2018-08-20 14:24:43 My standard salad dressing is olive oil, sesame oil and a dash of soy sauce.
4770 2018-08-20 14:24:42 This morning I tried cooking my eggs with olive oil and not butter cause #health and it’s gross so never doing that again.
4771 2018-08-20 14:24:39 Jeremy Corbyn has great financial foresight as he is in full support of Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela. I find that  Maduro has now taken that oil rich country into bankruptcy.

4784 2018-08-20 14:23:10 Do they have oil. Cuz we got some democracy to spread..
4785 2018-08-20 14:23:03 U like that cooked in charbi? Fats? Or use random oil to cook ??
4786 2018-08-20 14:22:55 I don't know what could be causing it. It could be hormonal but make sure to drink plenty of water, avoid fried food, always use a primer before applying makeup and always cleanse and moisturize your face before you go to sleep. You can tea tree oil to spot treat them too. xx
4787 2018-08-20 14:22:51 you know when u cook pasta next time add a bit of olive oil in the water and pasta while its boiling, that way not only do the pasta not stick together but it wont stick to the pan

4791 2018-08-20 14:22:39 2/ Most of us opposed the Iraq war for good reasons: saw it as a war for oil, or opposed wars in general, or had an anti-interventionist default. Others opposed it coz they saw Saddam as objectively the good guy, out of admiration for his brand of authoritarian nationalism...
4792 2018-08-20 14:22:37 And its not a guess drill, there's oil there confirmed by BP. So I can now invoice you for £20 aswell. :@)
4793 2018-08-20 14:22:31 It's only a matter of time before some natural foods store uses this as a slogan for its essential oil sale.
4794 2018-08-20 14:22:22 Itu yg precious serum ato oil? Drop pricelist semuanya dong
4795 2018-08-20 14:22:20 Ok. Well I'm sorry you feel that way but at the moment there's a lot of issues with Venezuellas economy that don't just point to Maduro. The argument for it not being oil rich anymore is in the video if you care to look.
4796 2018-08-20 14:22:15 Even though Syria was one of 7 countries israel wanted destroyed? US has been trying since 1950 to do just that. Turkey wants half of Syria itself and Israel wants the best parts with water and oil. The desert is for ISIS.
4797 2018-08-20 14:21:58 Take CBD Liquid or Oil, go to a doctor; move everytime you can into the panic attack by yourself to destroy the fear of the fear. This is no joke. You have to go all in against the anxiety. Learn what triggers you, trigger yourself.

4837 2018-08-20 14:18:21 Moving oil and/or natural gas through a pipeline IS the safest, most economical way to do it. Compared to rail shipments and trucks, pipelines beat them hands down.

4850 2018-08-20 14:16:28 Same old story, oil money will lubricate the conscience of the west. All this regime and country now is comes down to what their money could buy.

4882 2018-08-20 14:13:24 Venezuela has *always* been reliant on oil. That's not a Chavez-specific problem. But yes, it's a problem. Venezuela wasn't overspending until the GFC and oil price collapses fucked them over. And Chavez did invest in the private sector, deregulated industries, etc.
4883 2018-08-20 14:13:22 I've got the numbers somewhere. I did the analysis at the time. I'll have a look. 

The greatest shame is that we didn't keep Scotland's oil like the Norges did. I was just talking to someone who works for them. They are massive.

4943 2018-08-20 14:07:51 These are assumptions by EIA and OPEC. But historically assumptions made by these organizations are not accurate. The biggest ditterent for higher oil consumption will be Pollution. Even OPEC realizes this problem.
4944 2018-08-20 14:07:45 Because there are no energy projects in the other provinces, is that what you're saying? No hydro dams, no nuclear plants, no oil or gas...

Shorter timeline looks good.

I don't like the ministerial veto in 69.

4997 2018-08-20 14:01:44 Without getting into a review of economic theories dat we can't agree on, just note that the govt was dealt a very bad hand with d combination of factors; falling oil price, severely curtailed production capacity due to militancy and no back-up. The economy was doomed to crash
4998 2018-08-20 14:01:43 I don't think that. They were spot on the oil price thing. I remember at the time every indy voice saying that oil couldnt go below $120. Few weeks after the ref it went to $54.

It was much more fact based on both sides. I thought it was OK given how flammable the situation was
4999 2018-08-20 14:01:39 I feel sorry they still feel the need to ride camels. But hey, lower CO2 emissions. Oh, but I forgot. They are #2 exporter of oil.

5007 2018-08-20 14:00:46 High inflation rate is very likely to impact the country's exchange rates with other nations negatively.
INR at 68 in 2013 was due to such a high inflation. Which was in turn a result of high crude oil prices.

5015 2018-08-20 14:00:04 Decades of abuse by our Government in other countries for oil. The need for affordable energy innovation is imperative to the USA. Fossil fuels need to be replaced to save our Environment. Hopefully with new business booming in America someone will develop something.

But he was dealt a very bad hand with d combination of several factors primarily; falling oil price, severely curtailed production capacity due to militancy and no back-up. The economy was doomed to crash

5031 2018-08-20 13:58:15 And something like the old church can be born again. Until that time church will remain the network television cop shows, the Hollywood movies, the diversity and tolerance industry, the worship of oil given excess. Until the oil dries up, there will be sin.
5032 2018-08-20 13:58:10 Yes! Put them in a casserole dish in the oven till they're browned, and make sure to warm through the passata with olive oil and garlic (herbs: bay leaf, thyme, or basil if you like) before adding it. You want it reduced and sticky round the edges when you take it out.

5058 2018-08-20 13:56:19 It’s that taste of fresh in winter without having to pay exorbitant store prices. I tried freezing in oil too but it didn’t work as well. Only problem is limited freezer space.

5061 2018-08-20 13:56:11 Interesting idea, though I'd quibble with the implication it's new to tech, and hasn't existed for decades (oil companies) or even centuries (Dutch East India Co.)
5062 2018-08-20 13:56:05 Keromask is quite good, you'd have to set it but it should stay put. Don't use oil/moisturizer underneath. I've tried a gazillion concealers  Lisa Eldridge recommended this too. You can buy a sample pack to test the colours  set with a powder and then use some setting spray

How is the UK going to replicate that, exactly?

Where are we going to find the same kind of wealth that Norway has from its humongous oil reserves and output?

5101 2018-08-20 13:52:46 This is not true! America still buy oil from them. Their production is failing due to very bad government management of their oil company which was private before.
5102 2018-08-20 13:52:43 That’s the biggest factor. Cost of gas when oil was at this point years back was half the price and the dollar used to be low too here. It’s all these extra taxes. Trickles down to higher shipping costs, higher costs for police to patrol, higher costs for school bus drivers

5124 2018-08-20 13:50:18 No comments on the article allowed, again!
Just about every statement by the protestors is wrong. You don't pump waste fluids into an oil reservoir to make it flow. If its a commercial well, they might reinject formation water towards the end of life.
What powers their vehicles?
5125 2018-08-20 13:50:11 Exxon changed their name from ESSO (pronounced S-O) in 1972 due to protest of name similarities from other Standard Oil (S-O) spin offs.
5126 2018-08-20 13:50:11 Chale I’ve booked a 1000 seater kraa. The oil will flow!
5127 2018-08-20 13:50:10 Well, considering the economy didn't tank because of socialism; rather because of chavez' idiocy, their reliance on failing oil to sustain the country and hyper inflation due to chavez' Insistence to just print money instead of fixing the economy? It's not proper socialism.
5128 2018-08-20 13:50:08 SOL: Average R/bbl oil price in FY19 was R818. Currently 28% higher at R1048. If it remains around R1000, I make Sasol's forward PE ± 11.8x, yield: 3%. SOL traditionally trades at 10x but with an on-budget LCCP coming on stream, a higher PE can be justified.
5129 2018-08-20 13:50:04 Nothing to do with socialism. Oil prices plummeted, Venezuela's main export was oil, they are oil rich. So their economy plummeted. If that were reversed and oil prices spiked, goodbye UK economy and the pound would bite the dust, and people like you would be reduced to begging.

5137 2018-08-20 13:49:40 You can tell libertarians are dishonest creeps because they attribute everything going on in Venezuela to "socialism" and never once mention the invisible handcuffs caused by US/Saudi manipulations of the oil market and other government interventions into markets like sanctions.

5143 2018-08-20 13:49:17 We must put Canadian jobs and Canadian oil first. The Liberal and NDP have got it all wrong. Saving Canada must be our priority. Saving the world is a nice idea but out of scope for Canada by itself or with a gaggle of pretenders.

5238 2018-08-20 13:39:27 I favour free markets above all else. Tariffs hurt the poor. Canadian oil can and must compete with world oil. Our problem is, we weigh down our industries with regulations that our competitors do not have. Plus the east coast can't buy Canadian oil even if they wanted to.

5288 2018-08-20 13:34:13 @GregAbbott_TX Question: Can you bring CBD (Cannabidiol) e-juice liquid from Europe into the USA if you are flying into Texas? The oil contains less than 1% THC.
5289 2018-08-20 13:34:04 ใช่
5290 2018-08-20 13:33:47 Aunt crabby is the best. 

Auntie learned a GREAT cooking pro tip tonight! Add coconut oil to your sauteed kale and it makes it much easier to scrape into the trash!
5291 2018-08-20 13:33:44 I have no problem educating you on our culture babes. Just note that the picture above isn’t a true representation of oil down..
5292 2018-08-20 13:33:42 Either short or got ties to the oil industry. It’s irrational to not support an American company with 40k employees trying to move us away from oil and towards a sustainable energy future. #duh

5300 2018-08-20 13:32:28 If is not possible that Nigeria has more natural resources than the us, maybe we have more oil then them but that’s all. They have states that are almost as big as Nigeria and those states have mad resources.

5302 2018-08-20 13:32:24 Time to study Caputo. Stop being lazy. The 4.1% was just one quarter. Escalating gas prices caused by trump causing instability in oil market and rolling back clean energy an fuel efficiency goals, increase in health care premiums caused by destabilizing the ACA, warn us all!
5303 2018-08-20 13:32:15 I had the same issue a couple of years ago and bought a product called Teenage Dream, it's a herbal oil mixture, dab a bit on the affected area every night before bed and they'll be gone in a few days 
5304 2018-08-20 13:32:13 SO i took a tablespoon of mineral oil this morning. Let's see how this goes.

5306 2018-08-20 13:32:07 Per TR "Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their bullish positions in the U.S crude futures and options market to the lowest level in nearly two months, as oil prices declined under pressure from trade worries and concerns over a slowdown in demand. "

5340 2018-08-20 13:29:00 Does oil dependence cause terrible pollution? Is fracking destroying the earth? Do companies spilling waste into our waterways? Do people cutting down entire forests have any effect on the environment? Asking for a friend.
5341 2018-08-20 13:28:50 Nope considering they bought oil from ISIS and their special forces also colluded with them. The Clerics are the true power in Turkey Not the sock puppet, Erdogan

5368 2018-08-20 13:26:05 Oh, you don’t know what oil down is? It’s Grenada’s National Dish.
5369 2018-08-20 13:26:02 That was the expected response. But try to get beyond the anthropocentric frame. Before coal and oil were known as "fuels" for our utility what are they and how did they get to be under the earth's surface?
5370 2018-08-20 13:25:59 Just vegetable oil. A whole cup.

5375 2018-08-20 13:25:31 Try drinking coffee with coconut oil. It gives you caffeine but because of oil, the effects last really long.

5378 2018-08-20 13:25:13 From what I've read that initial prediction is common... I'm so happy you're already aware of your body being in PT. If you're getting stressed I recommend 5HTP, CBD oil, and make sure you're taking Iron if anemic? The emotional stuff was the most difficult to get through

5403 2018-08-20 13:22:29 The Saudi’s want to own as much as possible in the EV space to diversify their exposure to oil.  The fact that they see EV as a diversified is a sign of its long term viability.  EV’s save money over ICE.  Add in efficiencies of scale and the tipping point will accelerate forward

5435 2018-08-20 13:19:00 An oily matter, otherwise known as sebum, lubricates your skin & hair, preventing it from drying out and protecting it against environmental damage. The problems start when oil, dirt, sweat and dead skin cells become backed up and trapped inside of your pores.

5598 2018-08-20 13:01:20 Yeah your right. A money grab has been going on for many years. Medical costs, insurance, city's pushing up home costs for taxes, etc, etc. Hard to make it on 1 income these days; although I have managed (being an engineer myself in the oil industry).

5625 2018-08-20 12:58:01 Raising money like that's not a sustainable strategy, but we pretend neoliberalism is where other models aren't. It's bonkers.

'Boom time' in the UK has been fueled by public sell-offs and north sea oil. It'd be literally impossible for Thatcher & Blair to repeat their tenures.
5626 2018-08-20 12:57:46 Can we move on to the fact that Saudi Arabia is bad, actually, as are wars in general & throwing money at bad actors for oil has got to stop because of the human & environmental costs?

5632 2018-08-20 12:56:46 See, I am not being idealist. Using the oil sector as an example, I think regulators can end up with fines. As a matter of fact, multichoice lawyers will ask for a fine and it will be granted, if they pursue the case. Some sort of damages for frivolous action.
5633 2018-08-20 12:56:46 The most valuable asset in the world isn't MONEY, GOLD, REAL ESTATE, DIAMONDS, OIL or STOCKS, it's TIME. The good NEWS is everyone owns it. How you decide to spend it is entirely up to you.
5634 2018-08-20 12:56:37 The massive “red tide” is caused by after effects of the gulf oil spill and abundance of C O 2 in the air. In my opinion without explaining the details, because you know the entire world is challenging Meeeeeeeee
5635 2018-08-20 12:56:15 Now if 18000 mechanics listened to it and said, "sounds okay." Well, then it is possible something is still wrong with it, because they can't hear an oil leak or a flat tire. So there are additional things they might pick up, in person. But if they do hear a knock or hesitation..

5648 2018-08-20 12:54:50 Do you feel that if you stopped your diet and stopped using CBD oil that your anxiety would still be gone? Or would it come back? If your anxiety-free existence is dependent on these habits/tactics, you have found an effective treatment (for you), not a cure.
5649 2018-08-20 12:54:39 And what will UK offer Nigeria which it doesn't need EU materials to make?
Nigeria can offer oil and some food stuffs but not enough to maintain a 60m+ population and won't accept goodwill in payment, so what does UK offer in exchange when it has nothing to offer?

5659 2018-08-20 12:53:31 Uh, do some research before running your mouth.  Canada, the U.K., and New Zealand all definitely have their own budget for defense.  It wouldn't be as necessary if the US stopped inventing wars for oil.

5671 2018-08-20 12:51:34 Crazy how they pump right in the city. When they originally drilled & hit oil it must have been a geyser of oil covering everything around it.

5700 2018-08-20 12:48:21 I managed to get a rainbow bar during the last release. My kids and I are wiping it out pretty fast. The lather is really bubbly and creamy. Katie uses a good amount of castor oil, colorants and fragrance oil. It's definitely high-quality soap.

5724 2018-08-20 12:45:25 Transcanada makes money transporting oil not selling it, they are not affected by price swings up or down. It's a very stable business model but one of the downsides is they depend on a fair and consistent regulatory framework, something Canada no longer has.

5734 2018-08-20 12:43:47 You are absolutely right, my friend! The discovery of oil has become a curse! 
5735 2018-08-20 12:43:29 I’m a big believer in essential oil therapies. I use lavender 2 fall asleep, tea tree for my skin, frankincense for inflammation and my absolute favorite right now is clove oil! It’s analgesic and anti inflammatory properties make it better than any painkiller! #wellness #oils

5737 2018-08-20 12:43:25 I agree both! I use both the witch hazel is wonders on that acne and if u have acne scars really takes it away over time the oil afterwards rehydrates and glows the skin but the toner makes sure there's no dirt in there so they go hand in hand

Bayern is probably the only super club with zero debt. They still should sign some new players of course

5764 2018-08-20 12:40:16 Two big misconceptions: i) that producers can continue to play at $65 oil on the backs of suppliers (they can't--suppliers aren't going to tolerate unending losses), and ii) producers can pay suppliers meaningfully more than they already are (they can't). So, something must give.

5807 2018-08-20 12:33:51 Bakken also showed some higher gas oil ratio and higher water cut. Yet it is in its infancy. However, the recent development in the Permian indicates something big happens here. A few data points more and we know for sure.
5808 2018-08-20 12:33:23 Palm oil has long been used in food and cosmetics. The biggest driver of the more recent large-scale clearing of forests is demand for "green" biofuel.

5845 2018-08-20 12:29:45 WRONG.. first, Oil and oil futures-simply international trade operates under the US dollar. That's where the US comes in. They'll restrict Venezuela's Ability to sell oil to Morocco be simply blocking them from the dollar and American financial system. Hence, my conclusion..

5848 2018-08-20 12:29:18 So basically of all oil production countries in world only Venezuela collapsed but that was not because of Venezuela’s economic policy but because of external conspiracies? Which surprise did not affect other countries?
5849 2018-08-20 12:28:59 #Gulf_Keystone reported receipt of $27m from the #KRG for crude oil sales during May. #DNO has made $69m, plus another $5.99m & #ShaMaran got $12.7m. Total is $109m only for 1 month. Others not reported yet. I wonder if they've spent a penny 4 Capacity building & social programs?

5859 2018-08-20 12:27:38 You have wash the rice properly to get rid of the starch before you cook it. Then put enough water, add a table spoon of oil to prevent it from sticking, and leave it to boil. Taste the rice intermittently to check that its soft enough for u, then drain the water with a seive

5866 2018-08-20 12:26:12 Oil price crashed due to normal supply and demand of that market. But it recovered significantly to almost 80usd. From 120. Of all oil production countries in world only Venezuela finished imploding economically and socially. Why not other countries?

5871 2018-08-20 12:25:15 Just saw on Fox News where oil rich Venezuela, the socialist darling of South America has inflation at 1 million per cent. And, socialists in America want socialism for the US. Where 1% are rich and 99% are starving. Sure morons.

5882 2018-08-20 12:23:39 They nationalised the oil not ‘all means of production’ - When did that occur and when did the hyperinflation occur - what caused the oil price to crash?

 "Hi, I..."
Service dude (irritated): "You're early."
"I...I know."
"They ain't ready for you yet."
"That's ok. I'll wait."
He sighs heavily, like the person who should be more disappointed at my being at a dealership before 8am is him.
5890 2018-08-20 12:21:38 Corbyn was congratulating them for bringing poverty down from 50% to 20% then the USA decided we can't have socialism working and slapped sanctions and an oil embargo. Like they have with all south American countries that bring in left wing governments.

5900 2018-08-20 12:20:19 I’ve listened to him. I listened during the 2016 campaign, when he went after Trump relentlessly, as in the quote above. Then when Trump won, he switched sides so he could keep his fan base. He’s a phony, a snake oil salesman. Even the ads on his show are for rip off products.

5915 2018-08-20 12:18:41 Improving infra & EV will cut into oil bill but that won't be very significant for a very long time to come. GOI isn't very bullish on either. Would have expected them to have a 100% EV fleet for public transport atleast in major metors. Thats where we got to make a dent.
5916 2018-08-20 12:18:40 jada jada jada...  Venezuela is one of the most richest nations in oil why are they poor like that and why is nobody talking about the USAs sanctions on Venezuela?
5917 2018-08-20 12:18:23 Mostly my fix is to use ghee instead of avocado oil (coconut oil if a buttery taste would be weird). I don't have a fix for using actual avocados in recipes and stuff so I tend not to make them at all. If you come up with any substitutes let me know!
5918 2018-08-20 12:18:19 This morning I started thinking about the time Candace cut open her Bath and Body Works car air fresheners and dumped the oil straight into her car’s carpet to make it smell good. God love her.

5920 2018-08-20 12:17:55 Believing that by birth or because of the Holocaust that you are God's Chosen People and deserve special treatment is racism.
That idea leads to the Left's contention that Israel determines our policy in the Mideast. Hate to bust your bubble, but we care about OIL.
5921 2018-08-20 12:17:55 Iran exports around 2MM barrels of oil a day, about 2 percent of global supply

Russia pledged last month to increase total output by around 1 percent of the global oil supply

It may not be enough to offset declines in countries grappling with crises

Long-running production cuts by OPEC and Russia have drained once-brimming storage tanks to more normal levels. That means that any threats to output have a bigger effect on oil prices in future

6120 2018-08-20 11:51:06 We teach things about money most have never heard of. Ex: Petrodollar is the American dollar bill. If 1 party is buying oil big time from a another party. The only kind of money to pay for that oil is the American dollar. China & Russia are trying to get that to change.
6121 2018-08-20 11:50:56 The price of oil going up will please @realDonaldTrump because his oil industry buddies will earn more money. Who cares that the rest of us have to pay more at the pump?

6124 2018-08-20 11:50:49 If  Saudi Arabia oil exports sink below 1 million barrels a day, the situation could “get really dangerous,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

6133 2018-08-20 11:50:02 That "evil Russia" we sold 20% of uranium to?

That we gave half of the Iraqi oil contracts to?

It's as corny as saying China is a threat, when we single handedly made their economy what it is, at the price of a few trillion a year from our own economy.
6134 2018-08-20 11:49:55 We still pay in more than we take out that’s without many revenues like oil and whisky being rightly accredited to us.

6144 2018-08-20 11:49:02 major oil producers last met in Vienna, they said they would curb rising prices by ramping up production. 

Why, then, are oil prices still going up?

Oil producers pledged to increase total output by around +1 percent | price of Brent crude, has risen 20 percent this year
6145 2018-08-20 11:48:58 Because they didn’t have the financial capability with the oil tanking the economy making finding sponsors too difficult. That’s on them. SRU isn’t to blame because every club had to provide their own financial plan and organise their own sponsors all done without SRU aid.

6163 2018-08-20 11:47:06 And the US has bought up little of the oil there since. So they question everyone should be asking is, why? -there must have been a reason why they did it

6177 2018-08-20 11:44:46 Fracking uses a fraction of 1% of all industrial use of water.

Oil and gas wells do not contaminate water aquifers. They're thousands and thousands of feet apart in depth, with multiple barriers.

Aquifers get contaminated from leaks and spills on surface.

It took about 50yrs for the whale oil industry 2 collapse. It ruled for 300 yrs, then folks found cheap fossil fuels. It wasn't about saving whales. Renewable energy will do the same. In time.

6231 2018-08-20 11:37:12 Global oil demand each year has grown by roughly 1.5 million barrels a day of late. But higher crude prices coupled with ongoing fears of worldwide trade wars — led by the U.S. and China — could cause a slowdown in economic and oil demand growth.

6262 2018-08-20 11:31:52 Imagine being so deluded that you insist your oil producing, net energy exporting neighbours require a subsidy to exist.

Do the brits think they subsidised Ireland, India or any other colony? Probably Yes. It's an abject failure in education & symptom of a malnourished culture.

6284 2018-08-20 11:27:39 Of particular concern is a shortage of global spare oil capacity, Webster said. Many oil-producing countries are on the decline, while others are pumping out almost as much as they possibly can. There’s little remaining margin to boost production if supplies dwindle.
6285 2018-08-20 11:27:18 Don’t tea tree oil it. That does the opposite of what you want (makes more tissue, I have tried it lmao). Try baby aspirin that is crushed and made into a paste; if that doesn’t work, use sea salt in a paste.

6460 2018-08-20 10:58:30 I often compare crypto with oil. Oil in the ground has no value. Hire engineers, machinery, drill it out, pack it, brand it, find customers and suddenly this oil has value. Tokens on their own are worthless. Ripple created infrastructure, community and utility, hence the value.

6528 2018-08-20 10:46:30 That would be great but unfortunately the main barrier is transportation - as Neill has stated before, it doesn't transport well (whole oil drum of it weighs only 1kg ish) so needs to be made fairly close to customer. China? For Europe's requirements, I agree should be UK

Our Chicken Milanese is served with a fried Hens Egg on top and Creamed Spinach with Truffle Oil, so I am very sorry if this is not what you expected.

6549 2018-08-20 10:41:25 I get that, but even they are beginning to see that there is less and less to eat. NASS members are not balling today like the guys in 99. And oil was lower then. There are too many mouths directly being fed by the State. No way this can continue forever.
6550 2018-08-20 10:41:23 This is happening because consumers are supporting companies in their destruction of the rainforests and all sentient beings who live there. Stop buying products with palm oil!

6586 2018-08-20 10:36:17 US *and* Britain. Don't forget the British. MI6 ran the coup with the CIA, because Mossedegh nationalised Anglo-Persian Oil, now British Petroleum. Harold MacMillan in 1943 foreshadowed "British brains, American brawn" would run the world. Iran 1953 a case in point.
6587 2018-08-20 10:35:57 As for Venezuela... Sharing more of the petroleum wealth decreased child mortality and increased literacy. Corbyn praised this. Not diversifying the economy left it vulnerable to reduced oil prices and us undermining. Corbyn has not praised poor economic management or us policy.

6663 2018-08-20 10:21:58 In theory, it is easy to depress commodities: just increase debt (this is the problem of shareholders) and increase production. But what if the oil is just not in the ground anymore? More drilling and more debt does not help. In Eagle Ford and Niobrara it already happens.

6674 2018-08-20 10:20:13 I don’t see the problem with that tweet. There was a time when Venezuela was oil rich and it’s policies for taking care of its poorest were very forward thinking, misreported and should still be emulated.

6731 2018-08-20 10:09:06 Gas prices are eating up what little tax break his supporters got. Reinstating sanctions on Iran has taken a great deal of oil off the market leading to higher oil prices.

6745 2018-08-20 10:07:12 What the right conveniently forget is that in the 70's we had something similar, but the opposite. - Oil prices spiked massively, - what happened, our economy tanked. So in reverse, if oil is your main export and oil prices collapse your economy is going to tank, Isn't Mr Neil?

6759 2018-08-20 10:04:39 For my part I pray for their country, that in next few years oil prices quintuple and that Venezuela is restored to its former strong economy, but what do you think will happen to our economy if oil prices quintuple? Maybe we will be cancelling who wants to be a millionaire?
6760 2018-08-20 10:03:59 Actually, the price did come down during the first oil shale boom.  Then they curtailed production to push the price back up.  It's kept high by the oil companies who don't want to give up huge profits.

6786 2018-08-20 09:59:47 True. But basing the Bolivar on energy  is a great idea in principle. However this Petro based on crude oil (which no Venezuelan uses) & with no meaningful legal claim over oil in any case is fundamentally misconceived
6787 2018-08-20 09:59:20 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

6798 2018-08-20 09:58:06 TEHRAN- Oil Minister Zangeneh announces TOTAL has officially dropped $5 billion contract with Iran.
( I wonder if the French will return the $20 million of Iran's money they  pocketed in the name of TOTAL's feasibility study!)

6800 2018-08-20 09:57:40 Well if you are going to hugely and dishonestly misrepresent reality you should expect some pushback - Venezuela isn’t even socialist and it was the US that destabilised it by crashing the oil price
6801 2018-08-20 09:57:39 That's because of using some oils like palm oil or any poor quality oil. Chain tea drinker like me will use tea after Biriyani to segregate oil. Not only for Biryani, Always suppose to had tea as hobby even after Dhosa, Poori or any oil content food.

6805 2018-08-20 09:56:33 In the end nature will turn off the oil spigot. It is a limited resource, we have passed the point in USA production where cheap oil is produced. In a few decades this will point will be reached in the world. The real issue is survival of civilization.

6814 2018-08-20 09:55:49 Start the partnership on oil exploration at WPS. This is will help with our problem..when we have our own oil & we process it..this will cushion the effects of world oil price spikes..stabilize price eventually we could export these oils to other countries in the future.
Now na.

6824 2018-08-20 09:54:21 The US is highly unlikely to sanction China as a nation state but US authorities may move to block US dollar trade for Chinese parastatal companies if they are seen to openly break US sanctions on Iran.

6852 2018-08-20 09:49:25 In terms of demand - by assuming a 48k tons per day avg. pace, the palm oil exports for Aug1-20th were expected to reach about 643k tons vs 692k tons & lower by 7% m/m. Instead it came out more bearish than expectations with a further 17k tons lower demand, mainly EU & Pakistan.

6952 2018-08-20 09:29:16 Despite Trump's fixation on coal (because of desire 2 restrain oil prices & heavy insufficiency of totally green energy sources now), he is also pretty keen on natural gas, & the latter may prevail in th end. Same is done by Germany & many other industrial countries in the world
6953 2018-08-20 09:29:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
6954 2018-08-20 09:28:45 That oil is going up in the medium term we already figured this out. The only thing is how soon and the path to higher prices as other factors will also have some influence (ie. demand slowdown, recession, risk off in financial markets etc).

6979 2018-08-20 09:23:14 It may be a small part of the problem, but there's no way to show that, because the sanctions are so obviously the big problem that Venezuela has.

7019 2018-08-20 09:17:44 Yeah although I don’t think it’s about legalising anything, it’s about medicinal benefits of the oil which isn’t illegal.

If dropped - unrealistically- to $10 and Scotland  was independent. Would we be better or worse off for next 50yrs although there was none left ? However, oil is not be all and end all

7239 2018-08-20 08:40:05 There is another way. But over-reliance on oil and lack of development of the rest of the economy was a mistake.

Just like the market economy made a mistake in following "greed is good" as a credible alternative to socialism to its logical conclusion – hence 2008.

7451 2018-08-20 07:54:36 Dimwit president! One of the main Nigeria's economic problem is our mono-economy. 2ndly, oil price crashes always wrecks our economy; ain't no "looters" responsible. Historical Oil price crashes are 1981, 1989, 2008, 2014. It will happen again unless oil accounts for 20% income

7499 2018-08-20 07:44:15 Banning palm oil is a great idea. It’ll slow down the rate of decrease of orangutans. The danger is also population pressure and the demand for land.  Endangered animals such as orangutans should be protected and monitored by the United Nations.
7500 2018-08-20 07:44:03 Both of you are making points that wouldn't help the USSSR or Russia in the past or now.  Also, resources such as gas and oil weren't created by man and E.coli.

7517 2018-08-20 07:38:14 I'm still worried what will happen when the world stops buying Saudi oil though, given that are too many people there to be supported by local food production, and most of them have no real job skills.

7551 2018-08-20 07:30:18 Yes and no. Collaboration has always been the way forward. I learnt that when I first joined the cut throat nature of oil & gas that can’t exist without collaboration. But, you do have to stand out in the crowd or else you get absorbed.

7617 2018-08-20 07:16:14 Maybe  Government, who care so much for Scotland, offering a one off VAT refund on the 20% grabbed daily from Tourist ££.

7624 2018-08-20 07:14:24 Textile exports are down. In any case these are not going to generate an additional $200 bn in exports to neutralise the trade deficit. My point is, weakening rupee hurts us as our domestic costs go up. Be it oil, or many industrial inputs which are imported.

7627 2018-08-20 07:13:28 Every crop has its merits, but why is there a need to stockpile to excess of this oil? Whoever grants licences to destroy natural habitats for the sale of it needs a good talking to.

7749 2018-08-20 06:47:41 Lots of good news in the oil sector coming through for smaller companies.

7873 2018-08-20 06:18:28 Are you the only one with oil in their home?
7874 2018-08-20 06:18:24 Yeah, that was going to be my contribution.  Screw off the lens end, empty the batteries and dump some penetrating oil in from the front.

But  new one isn't a bad idea.  Modern flashlights put out more light in a more compact but a C-cell or D-cell Maglight is a better club.
7875 2018-08-20 06:17:55 月曜日に大仕事すると一週間なにもしなくてもいい気がしてきてアドやなあ
7876 2018-08-20 06:17:07 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
7877 2018-08-20 06:16:57 why did i just find a thing on instagram saying if you massage your tiddies with olive oil it’ll help them firm and not sag? i should try it out as an experiment lmfao

7881 2018-08-20 06:16:37 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
7882 2018-08-20 06:16:11 They may not want our whisky but they will *need* our oil, electricity and water.
If we get more from WM than we put in they should be happy when we leave. 
This is the govt that imposed the bedroom tax. 
Why would they want scroungers like us?
7883 2018-08-20 06:16:03 The biggest shift of wealth happend in the year 1850 when the people discovered oil..the 2nd one is happening now in cryptocurrecies(Bitcoin)
7884 2018-08-20 06:15:46 The same issues we have in #Biafra,  Harold Wilson was ready to wipe out the entire #Biafrans in 1967-1970 so as to keep looting the our oil and gas, nothing has changed today,  it's even worst now.
7885 2018-08-20 06:15:34 An oil lamp? I'm sure we can find one for you! It'll make reading in the evening easier. [She smiled softly, nodding.] And maybe some nice bath oils and salts? Hair wraps? I've seen so many tents selling things... We can find plenty!
7886 2018-08-20 06:15:14 i use coconut oil religiously
7887 2018-08-20 06:15:03 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using massage oil while they hide in the closet
7888 2018-08-20 06:14:40 Besides the high-exp expedition, the main oil sink is sortieing with a heavy fleet which probably won't be necessary for a while

7891 2018-08-20 06:14:01 I definitely trust an organization that receives millions of dollars from governments and oil companies all over the world to help solve #disinformation
7892 2018-08-20 06:13:57 coconut oil is really THAT bitch she’s all i need i love her
7893 2018-08-20 06:13:52 You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows 

7894 2018-08-20 06:13:11 Lol at all the people typing on their smartphones probably while sitting at a red light in their car about how bad oil and gas exploration is and missing out on all the irony
7895 2018-08-20 06:12:47 “Could I possibly have an oil lamp? They’ve always been outside my budget but I’ve always desired one.”

Norway having social ownership of oil rigs - the exception to the rule of state ownership which is a trusted 3rd party is exploited and destroys wealth.
7898 2018-08-20 06:12:20 Poof! Several thousand Albertans just lost their well-paying jobs. Do you want to tell them?
Oh, and Jason Kenney's election prospects just went up. You were hoping to build on climate action, were you, now that the oil enabler Notley is on her way out? #abpoli

7906 2018-08-20 06:11:20 Peppermint oil, and put an ice pack on your neck/ where ever the pain is. 
7907 2018-08-20 06:11:18 Thank you for this analysis... 
My concern is this: oil revenue figures (whatever category)  are very likely manipulated from source!!!  Do we then know the true state?
7908 2018-08-20 06:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: undercooked crust with fresh coconut oil and Italian sausage.

7913 2018-08-20 06:09:59 I got great news for you peeps.

7917 2018-08-20 06:09:09 @aaroadwatch @LiveDrive @GardaTraffic Lovely rainbow of fuel / oil on the left lane of the M4 westbound from Kilcock, through the Toll & about 5km out the Enfield side.
7918 2018-08-20 06:08:56 What a weak person, threatened so easily.  Weak sauce.  The rest of the world is walking all over us because of him and the liberals.  We are screwed on trade, screwed on oil, screwed on jobs.
7919 2018-08-20 06:08:51 @prashanttejura I do not think so, the key is the growth in this with crude oil at 70/- bulls can't absorb all bcoz. if you look at share holding than u can get idea how many small holders are there, anyway holding and added at 193/- as well waiting for 300, 350, 400
7920 2018-08-20 06:08:50 นี่ก็อ่านลุ้นมากกก  ม่ายมีชื่อฉานนนนนน ขนาดออยก่อนพี่เอนะนี่ เราไม่ต่างกัน  5555.
7921 2018-08-20 06:08:44 It's a wheel you need the new school to feel that way cuz thats the oil needed to wheel out something new, more like challenging the status quo (old school) even your education permit it
7922 2018-08-20 06:08:31 This set is absolutely marvelous Chel. The oil was a REALLY nice touch! This new idea was great and was executed flawlessly. Thanks for putting your all into your lewds. ♡

7924 2018-08-20 06:08:14 @ncbn  we use plastic items like
Paste tube,brush,shampoo,surf covers,food packing covers, lays packets,curry covers,icecream cups, buttermilk packets,tablet sheet,tonic bottles,oil packets,baby toys,pens,and so many.if we do 3 steps we can protect environment from plastic waste.
7925 2018-08-20 06:07:40 I had to use it a couple of times, but still the amount available in one box--and that was for water damage, not life wear. diluting tea tree oil into things can also help sometimes? it's strong enough to out-smell a lot.
7926 2018-08-20 06:06:58 Clay pot can last a thousand of years without firing. Oil paintings can alao last decades without protective coating.
7927 2018-08-20 06:06:46 Woke up craving the @McDonalds_SA egg mcmuffin and hash brown. Went to savannah and the hash brown tastes like overused oil and the oil is dripping. So disappointed 
7928 2018-08-20 06:06:40 The filling is pretty much a dab of vegetable oil

7932 2018-08-20 06:06:00 Wow. You’re no oil painting yourself there, sweetie. Only, you can’t blame it on age.

7934 2018-08-20 06:05:32 I wonder what the excuses are for us being gouged here in BC for gas prices? Our governments don't even like green energy resources and give subsidies to the oil industry. BC Hydro is not allowed to buy green resources!!!
7935 2018-08-20 06:05:17 Turkey bought oil from ISIS, gave them safe haven; now bear the consequences.
7936 2018-08-20 06:04:50 Have you tried cannabis oil cbd??
7937 2018-08-20 06:04:43 I use cosrx good morning ph cleanser for the morning (the face shop rice wine oil/foaming cleanser for night), klairs hydrating facial toner, klairs vitamin c drop, cosrx advanced snail mucin essence, cosrx all in one snail cream, and undereye caffeine solution from the ordinary

7939 2018-08-20 06:04:41 Cleaning tar sands should be the oil company's goal, alongside the procedure of extracting resources. If not so, it is additional spending of national resources instead of investing in the sustainable economy.
7940 2018-08-20 06:04:29 As an veteran, I’d just like to say that the United States Military is nothing but a mercenary force for big business and oil interests.  Fuck the military.
7941 2018-08-20 06:04:27 Fam it’s crazy fye with garlic olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika and lemon juice
7942 2018-08-20 06:04:08 Except now there’s SM and we can express ourselves with more freedom and less repercussion.

7944 2018-08-20 06:04:02 Cbd oil can help maintain that issue.

7947 2018-08-20 06:03:22 @ImranKhanPTI  Dear sir, we spend almost equal amount on importing edible oil and petroleum products. Being an agricultural country we can save billion of dollars. China imports its meat from Australia why can't we export meat to them. God bless you, ameen.

7954 2018-08-20 06:02:08 @ChrisHawkinsUK @shaunwkeaveny @BBC6Breakfast good morning, hope your having a good one. I'm not, I'm in Orleans( france) having left Paris 3 hrs ago, picking up 400kilos of basil infused olive oil to take to Spalding later today, AND JUST NOTICED IVE LOST MY PASSPORT. not happy
7955 2018-08-20 06:02:06 Check your air filter hose.  Did you recently get your oil change?
7956 2018-08-20 06:02:05 Quiz time! When air quality readings get up into the Very Unhealthy range like tonight, are there regulations that require industrial polluters like Westrock & US Oil to stop emitting pollutants that worsen local air quality? #port253 #TacCouncil #placeforjobs #RiseForClimate
7957 2018-08-20 06:02:03 Hey @elonmusk, my 7 year old son just told me he wants to be an engineer when he grows up so he can invent cars that collect trash from the street so they turn it into energy instead of running on crude oil.

7959 2018-08-20 06:01:08 Jr. accepted a meeting set up by Russians. The first excuse of it being about Adoptions-Russian retaliation on the Magnitsky Act that Russians want lifted so they can have access to oil drilling is all apart of the conspiracy. They’re expecting Trump to lift sanctions when POTUS.

7961 2018-08-20 06:00:56 ..are much more abundant then they pretend. There are a few countries like the US that have massive oil fields that are untapped and kept secret not only to manipulate prices but also to keep as an ace in the hole for when it’s no longer easy to get elsewhere.

7965 2018-08-20 06:00:00 Iranian Foreign Minister called for Europe's pragmatic steps to save the 2015 international #nucleardeal as the US threatened to reimpose sanctions on the country's crude oil exports.

7968 2018-08-20 05:59:58 I got extra firm tofu and pressed the extra water out and then sliced it in like 1/2 inch (maybe smaller) slices and fried it in a little bit of oil in the pan on Med heat. Getting out the excess moisture is key
7969 2018-08-20 05:59:56 Oil cleanse first after a long day and look into your face wash if it has a lot of sodium laurel sulfate in it (it’s what makes it foam) can throw off the pH of your skin too! Good luck baby 
7970 2018-08-20 05:59:05 The article is invaluable in bringing a strong perspective of real values. A single oil spill is too much for the #environment. 
"climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau’s pipeline doesn’t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere."
7971 2018-08-20 05:59:02 America is a terrorist they armed the Taliban in Afghanistan and Isis in Iraq for the oil ! 
7972 2018-08-20 05:58:52 เสมอซะน่าเกลียดเลย เราต่อเขาตั้ง 3 ลูก เชื่อว่าถ้าเราไม่เสียเร็ว ด้วยโอกาสที่ใช้กันเปลืองก็ยังจะพอถูไถชนะได้ แต่บังกลาเทศนี่ก็นะ เขาก็สมควรเข้ารอบอีกอ่ะ อุตส่าห์ชนะกาตาร์ได้ โอ้โห ขอชื่นชมจริงๆ แต่ผมว่าตอนเราเจอกาตาร์ นั่นก็ไม่มีอะไรอ่ะ เราควรชนะอีกอ่ะ 555

7974 2018-08-20 05:58:37 He really wants to convince us, like a snake oil salesman.
7975 2018-08-20 05:58:37 You missed me there, Scott

I am all for cleaning planet,we've made buying water a necessity. Add to the ocean's pollution of plastic

Wind, solar, hydro are much better than coal & oil

Trees are replenishible as long as we plan. Destroying the Amazon rainforest is not good
7976 2018-08-20 05:58:18 Is the high fuel cost justified or is it our own making of not making use of our  oil resource and closing our refinery?
7977 2018-08-20 05:58:08 Police say there’s been an oil spill (after a crash) on the Ballymiscaw Road between the Moss Road and the Ballyregan Road (closer to the Moss Road end). Drivers are advised to slow down in the area #Dundonald

7979 2018-08-20 05:57:34 Hot lemon water in the morning does wonders for your skin too and hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Your pillowcases can also play a huge part due to the bacteria and oil transfer from your face, change it every week or invest in a silk pillowcase to help with the balance of your skin!
7980 2018-08-20 05:57:33 On this week's menu we have:

-Substandard cooking oil from Malaysia.

Have a fantastic week ahead.
7981 2018-08-20 05:57:25 yea let's go jump in a pool of sizzling oil sounds fun
7982 2018-08-20 05:57:13 Some arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies suggest that oil companies make it easier for state agencies to pay taxes and settle fees, and that the currency can be easily and quickly converted into dollars.#Blockchain

7988 2018-08-20 05:55:16 PLEASE...look up Essiac's tea......go organic....totally.....and look into marijuana oil..& keep her AWAY from cell phones, big electrical power lines, tvs and computers......it can still save her life.....there ARE cures but you wont find them in main stream medicine yet......
7989 2018-08-20 05:54:15 We have to take on concentrated power and wealth. This is a problem created by oil and finance, it'll be solved by breaking their power.
7990 2018-08-20 05:53:58 CBD oil is rad. I highly recommend. My stress and anxiety are taking a backseat.
7991 2018-08-20 05:53:56 Just a thought...if the plane was in a straight dive at 50 mph, wouldn't the plane bust apart on impact?  I mean, hitting water at that speed would be like hitting a brick wall. I mean, that one picture shows the windows intact. Was there a fuel/oil slick?
7992 2018-08-20 05:53:50 これまでのデータが、また吹っ飛んだ上に、再インストールに二時間とか……

ショック死しそうですわ……
7993 2018-08-20 05:53:33 Is that why the US  army armed Isis to get access to the oil ?
7994 2018-08-20 05:53:25 From now on I'm using coconut oil for lube, get ready butthole, we about to get tropical.
7995 2018-08-20 05:53:19 Actually, the german emissions in the power sector are droppping again. But germany (and everyone else) have focussed too much on power, and forgot heating and transport. Oil and fossil gas must out of these sectors.

8000 2018-08-20 05:52:03 Pretty sure the oil slick and extending wheel nuts might have issues with road legality :-)
8001 2018-08-20 05:52:01 Not to forget that the oil for food scam also took place under his aegis.
8002 2018-08-20 05:51:52 If I went to church I would stand up and say “No Way!”  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
8003 2018-08-20 05:51:51 There should be no debate when a country is run down as it is.... 

Poisoned sugar
Poisoned rice
Adulterated oil
Wanton corruption

8004 2018-08-20 05:51:43 I’m sure Trump’s decision reinstates US sanctions that were in place against Iran before the nuclear deal was reached. All future business with Iran that is covered by those sanctions such as buying oil from Iran is officially off limits in the eyes of the US government.

8008 2018-08-20 05:51:05 This weird contraption where you put a little bit of oil in and i guess it moves hot air around quickly and makes food crispy. Think of a less greasy deep fryer
8009 2018-08-20 05:51:03 Palm oil is bad for your health and the environment. Any products that have vegetable oil on the ingredients label, it is usually palm oil. Good businesses will put what type of oil it is, palm oil is a lot cheaper than the healthier oils.  It is hidden in lots of products.
8010 2018-08-20 05:50:46 Police advise of an oil spill following an earlier collision on Ballymiscaw Rd, Dundonald between Moss Rd and Ballyregan Rd (the spill is closer to the Moss Rd end). Please take extra care on this route this morning. (06:50)

8013 2018-08-20 05:50:07 $20 is a pretty high figure for offshore oil

$10 seems more reasonable for now doesn’t it?

8033 2018-08-20 05:46:30 My Dad spent 2 years in Berlin after the war helping rebuild Germany with a group of young POWs.  I think he was also supposed to UN-indoctrinate them.

8041 2018-08-20 05:43:51 6. If anything, there would be the Robin-Hood-in-reverse policy, which will be reflected on the oil hike, for example, to recoup the mega loss during 2018 in the lead-up to and during the presidential and legislative campaigns.

They want their oil to be transferred into kerosine

So they thought they could fool us by greenwashing their fossile shit with a couple of solar panels.

Money flow is easy in a macro scale

The bigger picture is easy to grasp over:

Lets say oil will be out.
Rockefellers network is (july 11, 2014) 340billion so this money has to be safed in some way, split, re invested and will be continued in growing.
8084 2018-08-20 05:34:38 All of which are evolving rapidly to reduce their ROEI.  And they won’t continue to get cheaper if investors don’t spend the money on R&D like they’ve done in the past for oil & coal.

Does it really matter who used to have oil, gas and etc?! Look at the sick economy is happening now? Or do you get some income shares of gas and oil now?

Use your dipstick to check oil levels every couple of weeks, and before any long journey, and top up if needed. Pop your car back to the garage if you're topping up more than usual.

8152 2018-08-20 05:22:10 This government  has taken so much money from big oil that they are obliged to sell out not only Aamerica ‘s future , but also the planets future. It seems to be starting with us. This Administration will do anything for money . They have no other values .

8160 2018-08-20 05:20:25 It is about more than an economy -   Healthcare, separating immigrants, alienating our allies,sex assaults by our president, a racist president, neo nazis, a woman’s right to choose, common dense gun rules, education, a bully moron for a president, price of oil, dividing America

Also the massacre in Srebenica, not to mention the scandalous ''Oil-For-Food program. Yes, Trump contrasts with him.
8170 2018-08-20 05:18:27 It's brilliant Aussie art like this that led me into oil painting as a teen. 
So inspiring! It leads my eye right up that creek into shadows, and mysteries and wonder....
8171 2018-08-20 05:18:23 I used Jacobsen garlic salt and fried it in a bit of butter. I stir fried the veggies in avocado oil and only used half of the sauce provided. I don’t like my veggies all goopy.

8198 2018-08-20 05:12:10 This is exactly why I stopped watching TV news early in the election: They genuflected to an oil slick like Trump and painted an intellectual heavyweight like HRC as verboten.

8553 2018-08-20 04:07:42 金曜に不動産屋に問い合わせしたのに一向に返事がない………うーむ
8554 2018-08-20 04:07:29 Question: If you had only one match and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp, some kindling wood, and a newspaper, which would you light first?
8555 2018-08-20 04:07:07 Wow aggressive. :p
What I said was "Inflation rates tend to sit around 2%". Which is true. We're at 3% right now, but that was largely due to oil going crazy in Q2.
8556 2018-08-20 04:06:41 Watching All Or Nothing Man City makes you appreciate Pep that much more. They say you can’t buy success but it seems the “oil money” pays for a fuckin well run organization top to bottom. Hate it or love it.

8558 2018-08-20 04:06:25 Plastic thelli nahin sir coconut oil lekar gaya hey
8559 2018-08-20 04:06:24 uuh just like regular dial unscented antibacterial soap u can pick up at target (the liquid not the bar) and i think its either orange or purple? and ive heard tea tree oil diluted in saline is good but i’ve never tried personally but it’s also antibacterial so probably?
8560 2018-08-20 04:06:23 Ik it does add up. Most pricey for me is my protein bar habit $$. I also do a multi, ZMA, whey protein powder, pre-workout, fish oil, biotin, & milk thistle. Not too bad.
Back in the day my ex worked at GNC and that was soo nice, free stuff and closed-dated stuff all the time.
8561 2018-08-20 04:06:10 My dad worked an oil spill involving penguins back in the '90s. After that, he couldn't stand them. Quote: "They're the dumbest animal I've ever seen. They smell awful and bite."
8562 2018-08-20 04:05:59 I can’t find my castor oil *turns apartment upside down*
8563 2018-08-20 04:05:46 Yep we are dealing with oil. Until the deep state swamp is drained things will continue as they have for many decades! Corrupt!
8564 2018-08-20 04:05:40 They sure need daily brushing... Like oil the stripes, rub gently through the fur into the skin and brush. WOW
8565 2018-08-20 04:05:32 Curbing food waste would also help. Growing actual food instead of canola would work wonders. It drives me nuts that we use so much farm land to grow crops for vegetable oil, sugar and ethanol vs food that will actually nourish people.
8566 2018-08-20 04:05:29 as someone with dry skin nothing will make u glowier than marula oil followed by mario badescu spray

8568 2018-08-20 04:04:59 Oh yeah! Picasso was heavily influenced by a lot of african art and pretty much was legit with saying "primitive art isn't primitive as many art historians made it out to seem. They're just as artistic as ANY OTHER OIL PAINTING"

8570 2018-08-20 04:04:27 I forgot to buy both butter and olive oil at the grocery earlier. Apparently I’m just not meant to have fat.

*Like I forgot the nice cheese. Pft. Please. I don’t hate myself.
8571 2018-08-20 04:04:23 想像してみたら、やっぱりなんかやかましいから来ないでください:(´◦ω◦｀):
8572 2018-08-20 04:04:22 That won't be necessary. Once the oil stock and oil money runs over, they will be begging for one meal per day from the rest of the world. Even alternative fuel will do the same.
8573 2018-08-20 04:04:17 Do u know whn Modiji came to power, in hope of 'Ram Mandir', 'Ramji' started favoring BJP Gov,evn at Intl level.Crude oil dropped $140to $30/B bt whn 'Ramji' find no difference between Cong & BJP, started rolling things back.Nw more unemp, inflation,dirt, crime, insecurity etc.
8574 2018-08-20 04:03:35 My sister brought up how silicon in products don’t work for her skin and that I might have the same problem and this honestly explains why the smashbox primers I have don’t work on me! The facial oil is doing wonders on the bright side.
8575 2018-08-20 04:03:34 I burned myself with boiling oil 2 days ago and was praying that it wouldn’t leave a scar but my skin is turning so ugly and almost looks like a bruise
8576 2018-08-20 04:03:28 Oil needs changing
8577 2018-08-20 04:03:10 Also my hair is growing pretty well since I’ve been doing oil treatments and using bomb shampoo and conditioner 
8578 2018-08-20 04:03:09 what brands work well?? and would tea tree oil make things worse?
8579 2018-08-20 04:03:08 Five years in KP and police reforms accomplished. Five years in federal should get more since PTI should not be in dharna.

8590 2018-08-20 04:00:55 Data Localization. It is a condition to do business in China and all of them have no option but to comply. Data is the new oil. Even automotive OEMs disallowed vehicular data access to Apple and Google once they realized the value of the data they had in their possession.

8621 2018-08-20 03:55:58 The deep state swamp is responsible for blocking technology to bypass oil. Trump has no choice and neither do we.
8622 2018-08-20 03:55:48 Cali is dry as a bone most of the time. My hair (& skin!) loves humidity so I use multiple conditioning products throughout the month. It's especially important to dress my hair somehow... with Shea butter, oil, or leave in conditioner.
8623 2018-08-20 03:55:25 Yeah that's hilarious. Because why would any investment manager looking to hedge their oil exposure invest in more than one EV company? ! Hilarious! Of course they would only ever invest in just one! hilarious!
8624 2018-08-20 03:55:24 Has anyone recommended CBD oil?
8625 2018-08-20 03:55:18 Please fire the employee who called the police oil Oumou Kanoute. Shame on you for protecting the victimizer instead of the victim.
8626 2018-08-20 03:55:04 everytime I go to Walmart I forget to get tea tree oil ugh.
8627 2018-08-20 03:54:59 Jurisdictions like Norway (tiny, homogenous) and Singapore (tiny, diverse but controlled by one man for years) are the exception not the rule for strong government intervention. The Brazil or broader African experience with state run oil cos and high taxes is more typical.
8628 2018-08-20 03:54:53 I don’t think all journalists have only self- serving intents. But the news orgs- fox or cnn - are owned by the same stockholders of oil and arms . If money is involved the end motivation isn’t truth it’s an elevated stock price
8629 2018-08-20 03:54:44 I’m sorry but nobody can say “CBD oil” without me thinking they’re saying “captain big dick oil” and I got issues
8630 2018-08-20 03:54:38 every single one who mentions venezuela conveniently refuses to remember that venezuela is shitty because of its dictator and history with bad conflict regarding oil

8637 2018-08-20 03:52:42 Got those facts twisted. The Republicans only enact policy that will benifit the wealthy, big oil, Wallstreet and they destroy the earth for that cause. Not to mention they empower bigotry. But by all means act like your unique for choosing the wrong side.
8638 2018-08-20 03:52:33 Brussels sprouts roasted, sprinkled with olive oil and garlic, and maybe a sprinkling of Tony Chachere's CREOLE Seasoning are to die for.
8639 2018-08-20 03:52:16 ...other governments in the past had prices below $ 28 and did not have this crisis. Now the oil is more than $ 60, higher than the price of the governments before Chavez, what is the excuse now? "a calculated move coordinated with U.S. and Israeli foreign policy goals"...

8642 2018-08-20 03:52:03 From 1965, to the present day, America received less than 3% of it's oil consumed from the Middle East (roughly 2.6, I did the math in my head, feel free to check).

ALL GPs boats depend upon the stuff.

Why lie by stating " ... all that’s needed is the political will."? No 'political' will is needed for *you* to stop using the stuff.

8650 2018-08-20 03:51:08 Exactly- next year will be worse with our refusal to do anything about it - keep building oil infrastructure, reducing regulation, whining that India isn’t doing anything( they are), giving oil companies grants, denying the science - we’re so stupid.
8651 2018-08-20 03:50:59 The POS white bastard on the left who murdered his whole family also threw them away like garbage; dumpedheir tiny little bodies into a crude oil pit to cover up the smell of them decomposing& just left his wife's body in a field to rot.

8662 2018-08-20 03:48:21 Wait until Trump learns that the only reason we use oil as a fuel is because of how easy it was to disrupt coal production through strikes etc

8777 2018-08-20 03:32:37 Yup. Also, it's not "net" oil exports. Otherwise, there is no way India as a massive oil importer can qualify as an oil exporter. (India does have one of the largest refineries though). So, little misleading.

8829 2018-08-20 03:20:47 Forgot about global downturn in 2008? Global oil prices were at peaked in 2014, then slide began. Yet domestic oil prices kept high by raising excise duty and other taxes. We are paying twice as much as average global retail prices today. Reduce taxes or perish in 2019.
8830 2018-08-20 03:20:44 I painted my nails, drank peach green tea, did a coconut oil hair treatment, and have done 2 face masks today. I’m still depressed what the fuck

Why didnt god really bless the governing body? 
A find of diamonds here, some oil there, gold at another GB owned location? 
Instead they kept insisting you all were financially better off and should give to THEM. 
Why?

8838 2018-08-20 03:19:37 There are major businesses which have profited by Trump. Oil, coal, steel, media, private prisons, polluters, and insurance companies. I’d say look there for the blueprint. Look there for complicity. Look there for profit surges. He has quite a foothold. They won’t give up easily

8843 2018-08-20 03:19:04 What an incredibly ignorant comment. How about minimizing our military budget, closing a few of the 800 bases around the world not giving oil companies billions to make record breaking profits or huge tax breaks to those who least need them?
8844 2018-08-20 03:18:48 @JaclynGlenn I bet you  can debunk this one, I think it is some thing that should be tested even a Scientist I bet would agree. This bible leaks or pours oil.  Some thing tells Me this is a hoax jin a tub lol. that leakhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtVHrY7H1Vc

8862 2018-08-20 03:15:27 Hello. I get bitten by spiders all the time—some of them harmful. This always works for me:

1. Make a #poultice of 
baking soda, 
activated charcoal & 
olive oil (or any oil). 

2. Buy bandaids that are larger than the bite that seal all around the edges—to keep the poultice in.

8900 2018-08-20 03:08:02 Hey useful idiot. The socialism part of the economy works splendidly.  The majority of the population supports Maduro .  It's the capitalist oligarchs who are intentionally sabotaging the economy,  also the western media wants a coup so the U.S. can liberate their oil reserves.
8901 2018-08-20 03:07:55 Louise ? Yes Ethel ; this chocolate sauce seem kinna glossy to you ? Like oil from a fry pan ? Why yes ;Yes it does .

8920 2018-08-20 03:04:56 You will find that Crankcase Ventilation System &/or Pressure Control Valve (PCV) needs to be cleaned/replaced, as blow-by gases will pressurise crankcase & force oil/vapour back into air intake to re-enter combustion cycle & also, foul up any vacuum lines near throttle body etc.

8929 2018-08-20 03:03:06 Ethanol subsidies ended in 2011, oil has been subsidized over 100 years. The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol replaced MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. Ethanol is cheap octane, it’s also a non toxic octane booster. It keeps gas prices down also!

8932 2018-08-20 03:02:37 India is a third world country, when the global market was suffering from recession, the oil prices skyrocketed, the UPA Govt. purchased some oil bonds, which is being paid by the incumbent government needs to be paid till 2020-22. They increased the burden on our nation.

8938 2018-08-20 03:01:16 I agree, I'm glad Trudeau stands strong on this but it's out of his control. The only politician who could have an impact would be Scheer. But his focus is tax cuts/oil.

Also worth noting said leader gave up nuclear arms & was quick to contact Bush offering help post 9/11, preached nationalized oil, splitting from OPEC racket, & oversaw highest quality of life in all of  Africa. Hillary ed.

8974 2018-08-20 02:54:44 That pipeline was built to transport oil east lol. It wouldn’t need any approval to reverse the flow again

8978 2018-08-20 02:53:54 Omg i dropped this olive oil leave in conditioner container on my foot & now i have a bruise 
8979 2018-08-20 02:53:33 The paste comes in a metal tube. Best recipe uses whole anchovies that you chop up, olive oil, egg yolk, garlic, lemon juice and good parmesan cheese.
8980 2018-08-20 02:53:32 Should’ve bought me some baby oil earlier ... I’m always thinking of stuff AFTER THE FACT
8981 2018-08-20 02:53:21 I’m conservative. I want our oil in pipelines throughout my country. However, I’m Canadian. Our ways are different.
8982 2018-08-20 02:53:06 I didn’t wanna smell up the house from the oil with it being so humid mayne

8984 2018-08-20 02:52:43 About as mixed as oil and water.
8985 2018-08-20 02:52:21 Pastor Queen said that God will only fill up the bucket that you bring him. 

Tell God what you want. You want a Benz? Ask for it! But also take care of what you already have first.
You can’t get a Benz when if you won’t change the oil on your 2004 Ford Focus

8988 2018-08-20 02:51:43 Adding fish oil pills to your diet can help a lot. Also, Im not sure what allergies you have, but adding a little jojoba oil to your conditioner is good to  moisturize. Sesame oil is another good one. You can also put them in after you towel dry your hair. Only need a dime size.
8989 2018-08-20 02:51:42 What times will the movies be available?   
This starting to look like a scam.  Constantly changing.  Snake oil salesman. E-ticket isn't available in my area.  I won't renew my membership, unless it goes back to the way it was when I signed up in April.
8990 2018-08-20 02:51:10 Sometimes I hate being covered in oil base
8991 2018-08-20 02:50:55 Sudden darkness shall cover the world and the forces of evil shall be so real. Only the saints with the extra oil shall make it.
8992 2018-08-20 02:50:52 Sauté diced onions and garlic in olive oil! Add 1 large tin of tomatoes + 1 tinful of water! Add paprika, salt, pepper, ancho chili powder. Simmer 1 diced sweet potato in tomato/water until soft! Add 1 can garbanzo beans! 1 Black beans! 1 Corn! Add water as needed ~
8993 2018-08-20 02:50:51 Mung bean sprouts, sesame oil, salt and pepper, Maggie (hot), soy sauce, soy paste, green onions. Sometimes it has garlic & ginger as well.
8994 2018-08-20 02:50:42 I fucking hate liberals instead of crying over your minimum wage job just do what I did. Beg your dad for a 20 dollar an hour job on his oil rig in the middle of the ocean and promise if you get the job you'll stop doing heroin.
8995 2018-08-20 02:50:41 I used a BUNCH of dried rose petals & basically steeped it in water like tea, then added a couple drops of rose essential oil. THATS IT. It smells incredible too hOly shit

8999 2018-08-20 02:50:08 tell them gold diggers keep diggin, you might hit oil inna minute 
9000 2018-08-20 02:50:02 The story is a society that is collapsing. Socialism is the least of it. When your main revenue generating good (oil) plunges in price, it reveals a lot of economic weaknesses. Hyper inflation now. No way out.
9001 2018-08-20 02:49:46 You should keep zinke out of Ohio he will want to put oil barges in the Great Lakes

9005 2018-08-20 02:49:15 Stupid cartoon. Trudeau doesn't want to end dependence on Saudi oil, and he will never promote Canadian oil. Saudi oil is shipped to Canada by former Liberal PM Paul Martin's ships, which are registered in tax havens outside of Canada. @manny_ottawa

9007 2018-08-20 02:49:08 I like how he thinks because coal is basically rock in the ground that it is "indestructable," whereas oil is not, even though oil is fucking thousands of feet underground. He's thinking that, even if you blow up the coal mine you can still get at the coal with shovels, I guess.

9016 2018-08-20 02:47:44 The Rwandan genocide, Bosnian genocide, Food For Oil and many more was Kofi Anan. I will always remeber how UN troops in Srebrenica-Zepa left that city in the hands of Serbian butchers who killed more then 8000 inocent man.
9017 2018-08-20 02:47:37 If a woman lauds her own abortion and thinks nothing of the fact that she facilitated the murder of a child, she's no better than a guy who would stuff his own kids into oil barrels.

9020 2018-08-20 02:46:57 As long as you eat healthy fats, then I guess you are all good (eggs, olive / coconut oil, avocado, fish). You can still get your carbs from nuts, keto approved veggies and fruits. You just need to choose which is the better carb. Maybe a cheat day can help to avoid binging. :)
9021 2018-08-20 02:46:56 Chef Louis cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with Play-Doh.
9022 2018-08-20 02:46:52 I know. It drives me bonkers. The CBD oil enlivened it though.
9023 2018-08-20 02:46:34 Roommate made balling dinner, it's raining, got the lavender oil in the diffuser and I got my jammies on. I will fucking relax tonight.

9025 2018-08-20 02:45:56 It is...I saw a couple of others, maybe this was included, with a bar, and it was pathetic how things have changed there. It is a country with massive amounts of Oil & Gas energy resources as well, but socialism brings mismanagement and party cronyism, leading to misery above all
9026 2018-08-20 02:45:54 Try CBD oil. I’m serious. Changed my life. I averaged 3.5 hours for a couple of decades. Since stating the regimen, I’m sleeping more at night than ever.

9042 2018-08-20 02:43:55 That is Morocco. Goats climb trees to eat fruit. That is where we get argan oil they digest the fruit and leave the pits behind.
9043 2018-08-20 02:43:54 It’s time to manifest an oil diffuser

What an absolute legend!

9052 2018-08-20 02:42:14 WHY, exactly, do you think that IS, guys? Could it have something to do with the people we elect who then deny scientific facts, ban words but not drilling, have oil leaks, algae blooms, etc. on their watch? Scuttle high speed rail even after voters say YES over & over? #GOPscam

9073 2018-08-20 02:39:02 But what was ratio? Short of heroic behaviour, you often need 10 people to right the wrongs of one. 5 days ago, on a walk a CITY OF #Toronto  maintenance pickup truck drove by spewing a massive plumb of burning oil. Same truck, same trip next day! My CITY for crissake. @JohnTory

9077 2018-08-20 02:38:29 The only thing that’s helped me is the CBD vape pens or CBD oil under the tongue
9078 2018-08-20 02:38:24 Not sure what that means General. “Are you a terrorist-big oil man?” I cannot fathom the depth of vitriol from the losers of our last election.

9082 2018-08-20 02:37:02 Before I forget again something needs to be done about Woolworth's use of palm oil in it's generic products. How much money do they actually save while destroying the environment. Also need better labelling for 'vegetable oil' it could be anything including palm oil.

9088 2018-08-20 02:36:11 Is that to keep the oil from separating out?
9089 2018-08-20 02:36:06 So we are supporting our local economy. If we would blend more ethanol into our fuel supply, we wouldn’t have to buy so much foreign oil. It’s just reformulated gasoline, it’s just a homegrown fuel!
9090 2018-08-20 02:36:02 They had to put all that baby oil on that lil girl face?.....
9091 2018-08-20 02:35:59 I know cbd oil has helped me but if you’re feeling that overwhelmed I would definitely look into seeing a psychiatrist! No doctor should push those symptoms aside like that in my opinion. Praying for ya girl 
9092 2018-08-20 02:35:46 Oil cost huge gain and more than double revenue from petroleum taxes — no one refers to that how these two factors did influence fiscal inflation . If above variables are made apple to apple — reality shall get precipitated

9104 2018-08-20 02:34:56 And of course today is a day where my insecurities are on red alert. But bless coty airspun loose powder for keeping my face oil free after 8 hours.
9105 2018-08-20 02:34:53 Man this is savage. Sad but true.
9106 2018-08-20 02:34:47 1 petro
= 1 barrel of oil
= 3,600 new bolívares
= 360 million old bolívares (5 zeros more)

At ≈60 dollars per barrel, 1 dollar is 60 new or 6 million old bolívares, close to the black market rate on Friday

New minimum salary is 0.5 petros, ≈30 dollars, 30x the previous salary
9107 2018-08-20 02:34:46 Whut? Prop 13 turns 40 this year. This isn’t a divine right. It was a shitty policy response to the oil shocks and end of the gold standard. Btw it’s also the reason for our boom and bust budgeting and underfunded schools. But troll away...
9108 2018-08-20 02:34:21 Burn incense, play your fav songs, cuddle up with your fur baby if you have one; and try to take some breathes & relax if you have the time. I invested in CBD oil after doing hella research and I can honestly say its been the biggest help when I feel like I can’t breath.
9109 2018-08-20 02:34:21 NOT the MAJORITY of OUR COUNTRY!!

9111 2018-08-20 02:33:50 I'm lying in bed, listening to the Doors.

I really should oil the hinges...
9112 2018-08-20 02:33:25 There's no way @DonaldJTrumpJr  isn't covered in a thin sheen of oil 24/7.
9113 2018-08-20 02:33:24 Well somebody sure thinks this guy is worth something to send him go fund me money. I tried to open one to help pay for hemp oil for my grandpas disorder, but they shut it down claiming it was for drugs. Bullshit. Hemp oil is 100% legal in every state.

9119 2018-08-20 02:31:52 That we accept each other’s position & passion for each type of energy. But that we sit at the same table together & work out the most efficient & technological plan to reduce the unnecessary “burning” that is wasteful of oil & gas.This means accepting solar & wind with batteries

9123 2018-08-20 02:31:09 I’m soooooo tired of all these snake oil salesmen targeting parents of children with special needs...the worst is the “electric stimulation” tools and other pseudoscientific treatments for kids with ASD, ADHD/ADD, etc that actually try to make us feel guilty for not trying them!
9124 2018-08-20 02:30:52 hey ladies put coconut oil on your legs and it’ll make them super soft and they’ll smell good!!!!! you can thank me later
9125 2018-08-20 02:30:35 Is it fun for you to blatantly misrepresent others? With your fumbling misdirection, you are like a two-bit carny barker selling your pathetic brand of snake oil. It's hard not to feel sorry for the folks who bought into your (and Trump's) nonsense. Do you have to be so mean?

9128 2018-08-20 02:30:16 Gotta hold up that petrodollar or else everyone’s economy collapses 

Why else do you think we keep invading ME countries that try to make oil purchases backed up by other currencies/gold?

Saouds can buy any weapons they wants! Russians, Chinese, French ...not Canadian for now but they already have some...why not invading Yemen, stop the war and take the oil ?
9135 2018-08-20 02:28:03 “To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.”

9139 2018-08-20 02:26:14 Oh yeah, the world had way less homeless people under obama
But, do we count the people that fled to europe as homeless?

And now we house them on our expences, and the oil companys and others reap the spoils of war.
Police brutality didn't stop too. Obama also did nothing there.
9140 2018-08-20 02:25:20 Donating money to #kerela is like donating oil to middle east. They don’t need money they need labour for repairing the after flood devastation. Send workmen not money.

9143 2018-08-20 02:24:28 Pro tip:  toss it with olive oil, salt and peppa, then bake at 450F for about 5-7mins and you have delish crispy Kale that even my 7yo loves to munch on!
9144 2018-08-20 02:24:23 President Richard M. Nixon might never have been impeached were it not for the “oil shock” of 1973 and the resulting recession. You don't care about newspaper editorial pages, but you should care that 2/3 of business economists predict a recession by the end of 2020.

9147 2018-08-20 02:24:11 I DRINK TONS OF WATER. I EAT TONS OF VEGATABLES. I USE COCONUT OIL ON MY SKIN  & HAIR CONSTANTLY.
WHY AM I STILL A SAD HUMAN. 
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS WERE SUPPOSE TO FIX EVERYTHING
9148 2018-08-20 02:23:54 The vinaigrette is about 1T mustard (whole grain or stone ground), 1/4 c pure maple syrup, maybe 1/3 to 1/2 c balsamic, about 1/3 c olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste
9149 2018-08-20 02:23:42 i mean men also worked out naked with each other in oil. but they didn't fuck because they had decent women waiting for them at home.

but these landwhales don't even understand what love is, let alone brotherly love
9150 2018-08-20 02:23:42 It’s 10:23 And I have finally finished changing my own oil 
9151 2018-08-20 02:23:22 I should walk into work and tell those oil tycoon scums that I quit but I soo desperately need some more this money stuff I've been getting
9152 2018-08-20 02:22:52 Anyone try lavender oil? That works for me. It has really helped me fall asleep, and stay asleep.
9153 2018-08-20 02:22:46 The same place the trillions for war, billions for walls, billions for billionaires and hundreds of millions for overpriced ULA rockets come from. I never hear complaints about that waste. How about we just tax the church? Or stop oil subsidies.
9154 2018-08-20 02:22:45 My energy has been so fucked up lately. I need 1000 rose quartz and citrine plus endless eucalyptus and spearmint oil.
9155 2018-08-20 02:22:40 They understand it, they’re just being paid off A LOT by gas, coal, oil to keep the money rolling in.
9156 2018-08-20 02:22:38 After drinking all weekend I have a face mask on, coconut oil in my hair and I’ve been drinking water all day. Detoxing to do the same shit next weekend. #h8myself 
9157 2018-08-20 02:22:21 Hi love! Trying adding some oil to it to make it creamier or using it as a brow pomade!
9158 2018-08-20 02:22:21 Aside from the part about using coconut oil as sunscreen, I’ll try to take this on board 
9159 2018-08-20 02:22:17 No. I lie. I’ve not seen the kitchen stock set out so openly. (Reckon it’s a brilliant idea.) Probably a nightmare for flour/sugar/egg/oil type bulk purchasing: wastage, higher cost etc.
9160 2018-08-20 02:22:06 Tides foundation is throwing money around again. Corporates and Hollywood for Putin interfering in Canada again to devalue our oil so they sell theirs.
9161 2018-08-20 02:22:03 Gotta love how a 30 minute oil change turns into replacing the oil pan right before I’m supposed to drive cross country.
9162 2018-08-20 02:21:56 I am a fiscal conservative. We need to spend a tax dollars on roads hospitals police another essential services. In order to balance the budget we need a sales tax that we we can get off the price of oil roller coaster. But what politician has the Courage to propose that?
9163 2018-08-20 02:21:55 Spent $150 on different truffle cheeses and truffle oil DO I REGRET IT? Not one single bit

9170 2018-08-20 02:20:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9171 2018-08-20 02:19:56 I'll tell you my secret recipe for crisp and crunchy tuna bits (tapa). You need a non-stick pan, pour Century Tuna in Oil and let the water evaporate. Mix when frying. Garnish with veggies. Serve while hot.
9172 2018-08-20 02:19:51 Why is Robert Mueller’s head on @Oil_Guns_Merica ‘s body?
9173 2018-08-20 02:19:47 @cathmckenna since you are surfing at Long Beach Vancouver Island,  please take in the whale show at the National Park. You will hopefully learn why it is a sacred place and stop the dirty pipeline. Wake up minister of environment! Oil and beaches do not mix!
9174 2018-08-20 02:19:15 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
9175 2018-08-20 02:19:10 does that help keep the eggplant from absorbing all the oil immediately because that stuff is like a sponge for oil
9176 2018-08-20 02:19:05 I don't know the answer to this question, and I don't imagine it's been studied.  That said, remember that the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.  Agreed that much depends on the contents of the oil/concentrate.
9177 2018-08-20 02:19:04 Many people here just talk without understanding that the fund has $2T to diversify beyond oil. This $1B would be 5%. They can easily invest in Tesla too. Many private investors have invested in both Lyft and Uber. Tesla could never meet the demands of all ppl. Need to have more

9195 2018-08-20 02:16:26 Again, this is misleading. Only emissions from production would be reduced. Not from burning the oil. Which is the actual thing. The problem. The reason.

9244 2018-08-20 02:08:54 Have you tried Melatonin? It helps me when I remember to take it. The other thing I've found that works wonders is lavendar oil and one called peace essential oils in a diffuser in my bedroom. My mind can't ever just calm on it's own.

9253 2018-08-20 02:07:11 Saudi Arabia may have worlds largest oil reserves but they don’t have powerful military.  We provide it. 

Those children’s deaths & many others were result of Coalition strikes-US is part of that Coalition. 

45 could stop this if he wanted to. He has the bargaining power.
9254 2018-08-20 02:07:10 Thigh numbness is called Meralgia Paresthetica. CBD oil causes the cannibinoids to stimulate the nerves going to the leg. It wakes up the nerves and causes them to work properly. CBDa oil also rebuilds damaged nerves in the L2-L5 range.

9262 2018-08-20 02:05:18 I legit tasted the same if not better and since it's mainly vegetable oil in it, it actually SPREAD. Cold butter that spreads like... butter!? Novel. I'm never using other butter for toast ever again.
9263 2018-08-20 02:05:05 Mineral oil one? I need pics of the product sir
9264 2018-08-20 02:04:52 Saudi’s are trying to diversify out of oil. With 2 Trillion dollars. 5% going into Lucid means nothing. Not sure why you find that funny. Probably cuz you have a shorty... I mean shitty sense of humour.

9273 2018-08-20 02:04:18 Also I like oil cleansing for my skin. Commercial skin care products always irritate my skin. I like using almond oil.
9274 2018-08-20 02:04:12 Yep. And people have to feed their families. 

In the past I've compared breaches like Equifax's to oil spills like the Exxon Valdez. Only in the Equifax case, the cost of the cleanup is put on the victim who was never a customer to begin with of Equifax.

9277 2018-08-20 02:03:46 How many CEOs call others a pedo? How many CEOs miss their targets permanently? How many CEOs call for an uprise against 'Big Oil' whilst personally a big consumer of their products?

What you call 'attacks', I call 'helding accountable'.
9278 2018-08-20 02:03:45 It’s really difficult to predict oil prices or GDP in light of the changing Trade Wars around the world in reaction to Trump’s Actions! In addition it appears Mueller’s investigations are coming to a close that may dramatically impact markets!
9279 2018-08-20 02:03:26 y'all, I love garlic, basil, green onion, coriander, and ginger so much

also sesame oil

also salt
9280 2018-08-20 02:03:19 The oils you cook with makes a difference too. Switching oils takes some getting used to, but when you start making things in bacon fat and coconut oil, they become more filling. Speaking from my own experience, anyway.
9281 2018-08-20 02:03:09 There ain’t much that can’t be accomplished between coconut oil and baking soda

9284 2018-08-20 02:02:54 There's a line to the coconut oil? And this isn't even a Wawa tweet!
9285 2018-08-20 02:02:23 i can’t use coconut oil on my hair bc it just sits on top and doesn’t really penetrate but on my skin it’s , shea butter works on errrthang lol

9287 2018-08-20 02:01:43 Gawd, I hope so. I've honestly said I've never met a Texan I didn't like, but why they dig in when the obvious is so obvious? Oil. Can it be just the remnants of big oil brain? Serious question

9307 2018-08-20 01:58:22 Turkey is truly industrialized, far much advanced too because it is not a rentier state. If you remove oil from the equation, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and most of those middle eastern economies will collapse within a very short while. Not same for Turkey.

9313 2018-08-20 01:57:19 Which one to use if it's oil skin face
9314 2018-08-20 01:57:18 That's crap, Keynesian economic principles predate Nixon, the oil shortage in the 70s that led to the simultaneous stagnation and inflation is not something Keynes said couldn't happen, it was something that should not have happened at all. It's no fun trying to model that.
9315 2018-08-20 01:56:53 it's not bizarre. We're now a leading producer of oil.. of course he's going to want to cash in on that. I'm sure big oil has greased his campaign fund with lots of cash to make these statements.

9326 2018-08-20 01:54:54 He’s not s murder suspect.  They first said he was arrested for having no papers.  Then later said he was wanted in Mexico for homicide.  Mexico hasn’t found any record of it.  A homicide doesn’t mean the same as murder.  Homicide means death, but may or may not be illegal death.

9345 2018-08-20 01:51:27 It’s tied to mileage and triggers automatically to get you to the dealer for scheduled oil changes, tire rotations etc. If you search YouTube for your car you can find how to turn it off when it pops up.

9353 2018-08-20 01:50:04 So far your reasons why UHC won't work in US are:

*US isn't dependent enough on oil production
*US isn't a tax haven
*US can's sustain budget deficits (!!)

And now you're adding: US isn't white enough? Really? You're going to go there?

But then, maybe that's where you started.

9379 2018-08-20 01:47:34 With that logic if oil goes to $100 and operators spud 50% more wells in Response, that play is still not cash flow positive.  And if price goes to $40 and drilling stops the play is cash flow positive.  That analysis isnt economically logical .

9388 2018-08-20 01:46:40 BBQ enchiladas are quite good, especially with a mild white cheese. 5 ingredients and you're done. Tortillas (corn), oil (to briefly fry and soften the tortillas), BBQ filling, hatch and cheese.
9389 2018-08-20 01:46:28 There are alot preaching anointing oil, handkerchiefs,powder,soaps, and other stuff but few are preaching the Cross of Jesus..... I sense revival
9390 2018-08-20 01:46:28 Olive oil? "I couldn't find a branch." #epicsistermoment @HallmarkChannel @dpaulsonprods @K_ear_sten #ChesapeakeShores #OBriens #Chessies #Hallmarkies #hailtohallmark #christmasmuviesspotlight
9391 2018-08-20 01:46:27 @KeiserReport when will you talk about #Iran and #Venezuela, about their inflation, economic sanctions, and #cryptocurrencies in these country. About oil's price, fracking on usa and how it is related with the above?
9392 2018-08-20 01:46:06 Psst, paper napkins are perfect for oil blotting!!!
9393 2018-08-20 01:45:56 Maybe some cannabis oil will help his butthurt?
9394 2018-08-20 01:45:27 Could you do crude oil? Seems primed
9395 2018-08-20 01:45:14 PSU Oil: Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd are likely to consolidate next week with a slight positive bias
9396 2018-08-20 01:45:10 apparently they are literally greesey like dripping in oil which is .. deff not as appealing to me now >_< also not crunchy.. double.. meh
9397 2018-08-20 01:45:06 We lost income as a family of 6. No matter how you try to sell the snake oil, is still crap.

なんなんこのノリww楽しいんだけどww
9399 2018-08-20 01:44:37 who the fuck named tea tree oil???? it doesn't smell like tea OR trees
9400 2018-08-20 01:44:36 In the spirit of Gioias, dump a gallon of cooking oil on the pizza and you're finished.
9401 2018-08-20 01:44:21 اللهم امين تسلم محمود
9402 2018-08-20 01:44:19 Maybe they are not single Issue voters, or see the bigger picture rather than simply voting self interest? 
I know might be hard to understand for ppl voting for no other reason than electing 1st transgender 

In or near retirement nothing changes
9403 2018-08-20 01:44:13 Day 1 of Black Seed Oil
9404 2018-08-20 01:44:03 Ask yourself..why does the Saudi PIF want to invest in EV technology.  Then look at how #oil has been doing. Game over! Fact that they are spreading the money around is an indicator of the future.  long $TSLA
9405 2018-08-20 01:43:53 そりゃ〜？ねぇ？(´^ω^｀)ﾌﾞﾌｫwww
9406 2018-08-20 01:43:23 Come to think of it, do we even know where can-ola oil comes from?

Maybe they're also nice because they're getting rich off it too.
9407 2018-08-20 01:43:20 If buying avocado oil isn’t an indication of me getting my shit together then I don’t really know what is.
9408 2018-08-20 01:43:15 I dead ass just made my plate & that shit goneshit was oil

9410 2018-08-20 01:42:50 commodities paling sakit this quarter. kena deal with that. Malaysian tax collection pun hambar. we basically don't pay tax at all right now i.e. Gst 0%. come sst, low government income, effect besar GDP. takleh nak harapkan domestic spending and oil revenue
9411 2018-08-20 01:42:46 My girl put jamacian caster oil on my dick oh my it's like lube but not at slippery but stays on
9412 2018-08-20 01:42:34 Leyó bien el partido Coudet esta vez. Lo aseguró desde el banco. Buen ingreso de Solari, que habilitó a Oil, para anotar el 2-0. A Cristaldo le anularon el 3ro.
9413 2018-08-20 01:42:28 or say, Bryan at the oil rumble
9414 2018-08-20 01:42:18 You all are too cute!!

9418 2018-08-20 01:41:52 hot oil treatments make my scalp feel good & my hair soft
9419 2018-08-20 01:41:31 All I know is I live in Texas in the heart of oil country.  And yet there was a big pile of Teslas parked at Costco and the mall today.  Maybe Tesla is paying people to drive their cars to the movies to store them?
9420 2018-08-20 01:41:30 Y’all say Grease or Oil ?
9421 2018-08-20 01:41:29 This jackwagon @oilngas007 is a front and an apologist for the Trudeau Liberals. He claims to work for the oil industry. The facts support otherwise. 10 followers says it ...
9422 2018-08-20 01:41:00 I cant stress enough how castor oil made my eyebrows and lashes so bomb , i wanna try my hair masks  now  with it but its so thick its gonna be hard getting out  but yall really should go cop some
9423 2018-08-20 01:40:42 Salt pepper garlic and onion powder olive oil. It’s actually pretty good. It just looked like a cruel mockery of a pizza pie sitting on the oven like that.
9424 2018-08-20 01:40:15 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
9425 2018-08-20 01:40:00 Ive known too many who would think the oil one was flirting
9426 2018-08-20 01:40:00 Beauty Tip: Apply coconut oil to your  eyelashes to make them longer & fuller.
9427 2018-08-20 01:39:48 I have an idea..why doesn't every war torn country sitting on oil in the Middle East employ Russian contractors and labour? That way the ISIS and rebel lies will be exposed and America will help the Russian economy!
9428 2018-08-20 01:39:14 I can eat their grilled stuff and fries cause they aren’t cooked in peanut oil but not the nuggets. haha I’m way too scared to do that I’ve had too many reactions & they get worse everytime & the last time I should have used my epi pen so I don’t risk anything anymore lol.
9429 2018-08-20 01:38:53 Who has oil cartridges???
9430 2018-08-20 01:38:41 I am sleeping with my essential oil defuser on HIGH tonight, after my computer decided to delete all of my completed edTPA files. Why am I being tested when it is not even Monday.

9432 2018-08-20 01:38:26 Chimichurri sauce - just cilantro (or parsley) with red wine vinegar, a bit of garlic, salt and red pepper flakes and a dash of olive oil. I particularly like with skirt or flank.
9433 2018-08-20 01:38:16 why not olive oil?
9434 2018-08-20 01:38:15 ใจกุ
9435 2018-08-20 01:38:11 Flooding Western oriented countries with Sharia oriented people is like mixing oil and water. They are not complementary and will never combine.
9436 2018-08-20 01:37:42 WHY IS FAKE TRUMP REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA & TRUMP MORE THAN THE INTERESTS OF THE USA  / TRUMP WANTS THE $30 BILLION FEE THAT RUSSIA WILL GIVE TO TRUMP FOR ALLOWING RUSSIA TO GIVE EXXON THE $500 BILLION RUSSIAN OIL DEAL--COLLUSION & CRIMINAL-LOCK TRUMP UP
9437 2018-08-20 01:37:31 Your Mumu will continue, because you are not just a bad example to the youth entirely, U are a hypocrite, Who feast on lies. 4 many years obasanjo rule Nigeria and looted oil funds, your mumu never do when you dey enjoy looted funds and buying more cocaine. Your mumu just Start.
9438 2018-08-20 01:37:12 Ouch ...olive oil may help.
9439 2018-08-20 01:37:05 Start with a really intense cardio activty. Get yourself into a good sweat for about 30-45mins, then take Saint John's wort with your dinner, put lavender oil on your pillows, and listen to some rainymood
9440 2018-08-20 01:37:00 You fail to realize that the scams are made possible by all these mega twitter account shill evangelists that everyone follows out of pure herd mentality fomo. These are the new snake oil salesmen of old and make the average token buyer think their investments will moon.
9441 2018-08-20 01:36:39 Need an oil cut. Pray it's 110%.
9442 2018-08-20 01:36:25 Hydrox-1908, Oreos launched as imitation of Hydrox cookie mfg by Sunshine-1912
Reformulated without Crisco early 90's (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil: cottonseed oil & later, soybean oil)
01/06, Nabisco replaced trans fat in Oreo cookie w/ non-hydrogenated vegetable oil.
9443 2018-08-20 01:36:07 That's just a Kennedy thing. Why, if people who kill other people got arrested on a regular basis, the whole family legacy might come undone!
9444 2018-08-20 01:35:52 Kailangan ko ng magpa change oil tsaka magpa tune up. Hays. Letseng ulan naman to.
9445 2018-08-20 01:35:37 He’s ridiculous. He’s not mentally sound. It’s like fighting fire with oil.
9446 2018-08-20 01:35:31 Well if there’s one thing you can trust it’s the word of an oil company executive.
9447 2018-08-20 01:35:30 i want to bathe in peppermint oil
9448 2018-08-20 01:35:09 Wanted to go to sleep an hour and a half ago. Not sure what happened but I had the sudden urge to put my oil diffuser on and lay in my room full of peppermint.
9449 2018-08-20 01:35:04 Ok .... wouldn’t it be better to use the revenue from Canadian oil to help speed up the transition to 100% renewable ? The transition can’t happen over night ... agreed ? So if we MUST use oil in the interim ... where do we get it from ? Its a no brainer .
9450 2018-08-20 01:35:02 I've been using @livelovepolish Honeysuckle Pear cuticle oil and it works so well and smells absolutely fantastic!
9451 2018-08-20 01:34:51 They sell the sub oil in bottles  not exactly lay the same but still amazing!!!
9452 2018-08-20 01:34:48 Better let the oil companies know the pres opposes all subsidies for energy. ;)
9453 2018-08-20 01:34:37 Kodavas in Karnataka & Kerala needs to be assisted. Federation of Mysuru Petroleum Traders comprising Dealers of all the three Oil Marketing Company's would pitch in once the floods recede. Contribution from Dealers is overwhelming.
9454 2018-08-20 01:34:37 We greatly appreciate you as an outstanding BUBBA brand ambassador!  Go Shea! 
9455 2018-08-20 01:34:32 あらぁ

9456 2018-08-20 01:34:12 Poin up oil moving slow den a bih
9457 2018-08-20 01:34:02 DB: Can you send me the link on CBD oil you buy from?
9458 2018-08-20 01:33:59 Put some baby oil on y’all feet and slide back
9459 2018-08-20 01:33:50 Are you sure about that?  There have been some very corrupt regimes in the past.  They kept most of the oil profits for themselves. That is why you had an oil-rich country with extreme poverty.
9460 2018-08-20 01:33:45 I’m ready to eat Chinese food and rub lavender oil on so I can get that deeeeeppp sleep.
9461 2018-08-20 01:33:35 "Canola" in canola oil is really an acronym for "Canada oil, low acid"
9462 2018-08-20 01:33:21 #BNoirDetour "I love the park after it rains: rats, vermin, oil slicks from the asphalt"
9463 2018-08-20 01:33:11 Stop all the meds.  You have blond hair with blue eyes. Chances are your eyes are producing too much oil and causing your eyes to be red and sting.  This is often misdiagnosed when it is quite easy to cure.  Follow and DM and I will explain.  Had this problem for years.  Easy fix
9464 2018-08-20 01:33:09 My head hurts blehh
9465 2018-08-20 01:33:04 Lavender Essential oil!!!
9466 2018-08-20 01:32:43 does anyone else just love the commercials of the ducks getting the oil cleaned off them

9468 2018-08-20 01:32:23 nope ! not at all.. Holy moley, Did Obama give this guy BONG HITS laced with Hash Oil or something? Not sure he is outta that trance yet.  Lol
9469 2018-08-20 01:32:21 THE SETTING FLOUR POWDER!!! Everytime I go to buy it's, they're sold out. Not even made though, because it's a company I'm so proud of and stan. I'd like to try their wake & bake oil too, and foundation
9470 2018-08-20 01:32:00 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
9471 2018-08-20 01:31:43 I need to oil my hair tomorrow
9472 2018-08-20 01:31:25 *Deported illegal immigrants. Which, you know, he had a responsibility to do. 
*Did NOT increase oil production. Was actively against it, but oil productions increased during his presidency. BIG difference.
*Mandate??? He's not a king. Where's your critique of Congress?
9473 2018-08-20 01:31:21 Ya but Aberg is still young and can be a middle 6 F, 8 points in 16 games with the Oil isn’t bad. Joensuu will probably never come back like Roman Horak. I can see 1 player getting traded and thats Kass. Too much cap. Too much for a 4th liner. Trade him and maybe a pick for a D?
9474 2018-08-20 01:31:19 Can you take the oil out? I can't have the oils and I just don't buy yours anymore because of it. Please don't tell me it's healthy because it's not. Thanks
9475 2018-08-20 01:31:11 Massage oil to a friction then wash it off with dish soap. If your hands where dry before handling the chili, I’d use rubbing alcohol. If all else fails, light your hands on fire 
9476 2018-08-20 01:30:57 Now an oil club but people would do well to remember they had 20,000-30,000 attendances and sell-outs in the third tier in the 90s (then Division Two, now League One) - not dissimilar to their attendance today. Infiltration by plastic flag waving tourists is endemic in the EPL.
9477 2018-08-20 01:30:56 I somehow managed to get medicated oil in my ear. It’s whole different level of burning 
9478 2018-08-20 01:30:41 What would they use instead of skates and paint? High speed horseback oil murals?
9479 2018-08-20 01:30:41 Providing jobs is the responsibility of Government and they are judged for that. Every government has its bit of luck, if Manmohan Singh had economic boom Modi had low oil prices here important is what people got from that.

9482 2018-08-20 01:30:29 I think I retweeted you more than anyone when you had like 20 followers and I said I’m following/retweeting because you were poo_picker. I’m taking credit for this.

おめでとうございます
9485 2018-08-20 01:29:46 Murphy's Oil Soap is magic. Did all the cabinets in the pantry. Also pulled everything off the counter so I could simple green it & washed the mats that go under the dish drainers.

Tired of summer though. Even on a cooler day, that got me dripping sweat.
9486 2018-08-20 01:29:44 On this day in 1953, the #CIA of the #UnitedStates overthrew the democratically elected government of #Iran after Iran nationalized its oil industry.
9487 2018-08-20 01:29:09 Oil pipe blogger lol
9488 2018-08-20 01:28:49 I'm calling BS. The oil and gas industry, which is employing 100s of thousands was at a stand still election time. When Trump was elected business sky rocketed dwarfing what was lost in solar energy investments. I worked on one 9 month project worth 10s of billions of $s.
9489 2018-08-20 01:28:40 trump doesn't know big oil takes billions in subsidies?
9490 2018-08-20 01:28:17 Fun With Food Cooking Class....!!!!

3rd course: Fresh cherry slice

We always eat good.....!!!!
Fun With Food....!!!!
9491 2018-08-20 01:28:11 Only the most ignorant right wingnuts chant Venezuela as some  gotcha to socialism or Democratic socialism. News flash geniuses, Venezuela is 70% capitalist. Corporate corruption, US political and economic interference contribute to problems as well. Why? Oil. What a shocker.
9492 2018-08-20 01:28:08 Oh word, I started with 300 (per 30 ml) but just bumped it up to 6 (so 20 mg per dose - it's mixed with 30 ml of hemp oil) and I've noticed considerable improvement - I even give it to my dog and it made his coat grow back!! He was bald on half his body when I rescued him 
9493 2018-08-20 01:27:48 Try cetaphil cream or cerave... you can also try unrefined virgin coconut oil.  That’s what I use when my eczema acts up.  Some of the lotions also have “for eczema” products... a doctor can also prescribe a medicated cream, which helps a lot.
9494 2018-08-20 01:27:44 ok sure but it’s still bottom tier on oil
9495 2018-08-20 01:27:27 今日ですか
9496 2018-08-20 01:27:27 Does she know your twitter handle used to be poo_picker?
9497 2018-08-20 01:27:20 Get this coconut oil or Baking soda n mix plus Apple cider Vinegar. Play it every morning or evening
9498 2018-08-20 01:27:07 You can learn a lot by staring at something for a while - for example, I learned that there were indeed mice/rats living in my engine bay and they attempted to chew through my firewall in multiple places along with poop everywhere. Oh, and that I need an oil change.
9499 2018-08-20 01:27:05 parut mmg takleh hilang selagi tak pakai Bio Oil.
9500 2018-08-20 01:27:01 It's like oil in your veins. Bubbling up, taking up the space where your blood needs to flow. Slowly it chokes you out. You barely notice the lack of breath.

You open your mouth. It's too late.
9501 2018-08-20 01:26:49 Not just that but the UCP wants to paint the NDP as anti oil & they use this as “proof”. So the NDP is apparently anti oil because they did as requested by the heads of industry (just like the CT, it was industry’s idea) & worked with industry and that “proves” they r anti oil 
9502 2018-08-20 01:26:37 Uniquely identify your assets with an #RFID tag to reduce loss in the oil and gas industry.
9503 2018-08-20 01:26:34 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "ASMR Lotion & Oil Ear Massage (NO TALKING) Varied w/ Gel Pads for Extra Tingles!  2 HOUR" à l'adresse
9504 2018-08-20 01:26:27 Ok so I painted my nails, waxed, plucked, exfoliated, and soaked in a tub with lavender and rose oil. Idc who you are, this feels nice.  #selfcare #smoothaf
9505 2018-08-20 01:26:25 this Sunday’s face mask is charcoal, mint and coconut oil 
9506 2018-08-20 01:26:05 Aku msh bingung kenapa kalian merasa bau banget. Serius rosehip oil aku gak berbau menyengat gimana2 gt loh.
9507 2018-08-20 01:26:04 Depending on which rice you using, I still suggest 1/2 cup of rice and 2/3 of water also adding a tablespoon of vegetable/olive oil to have a smooth flavorable touch
9508 2018-08-20 01:26:01 I had a 30 minute cry session about having to talk to mechanics to schedule an oil change and then another cry session about everyone possibly hating me in college. I think I'm ready for the semester to begin.
9509 2018-08-20 01:25:53 Peterson can definitely be added to the list of infamy... He's a snake oil selling prick.
9510 2018-08-20 01:25:51 That LEGO isn’t a problem removing, I’ve good tools. Have you tried olive oil on the flex-seal?
9511 2018-08-20 01:25:47 yes egirls 5% cod nerd beating his dick in discord that'd be maaaad oil there 
9512 2018-08-20 01:25:13 McConnell another ‘forked tongue’ snake oil obstructor
9513 2018-08-20 01:25:06 @sweetenersecret I must say Ariana grande is the water and Pharrell is the oil THEY DO NOT FUCKING MIX, I hope this is the last album Pharrell is on just saying

9517 2018-08-20 01:24:24 I’m so upset @Walmart I had my oil changed today and now my car is smoking and shaking  and all they had to tell me was there was nothing they could do I would just have to deal with it  wasn’t concerned at all didn’t apologize or nothing how rude
9518 2018-08-20 01:24:17 Argan oil bottle: pour a small amount into the palm of your hand :)
My palms, almost overflowing with argan oil for my thick-ass hair: help
9519 2018-08-20 01:24:11 yea extra virgin olive oil is the best :D

9525 2018-08-20 01:23:15 When I consulted on wtf happened, I was told some products are not homogenized because the oil, etc, is not added in the right ways at the right stages. It's a cottage industry. Some companies "drip it on at the end" & there just isn't the standardization you'd expect, yet.

9579 2018-08-20 01:13:40 Venezuela's problems were never due to socialism so much as it's boom and bust oil economy. but no one saying we should Implement full social ism we should model ourselves off policies like Denmark which in act socialist policies with in a capitalist framework

They are doing this assuming LOU will be issued. But looks like it is delayed by oil ministry. Alll bad loans.
9584 2018-08-20 01:13:12 This is a coalition between Trump, Israel & Saudi Arabia. I believe Trump made a deal with Saudis to increase oil production to make up for Iran's oil in exchange for squashing the deal.
9585 2018-08-20 01:13:11 Here's some logical thinking for you.

Trump sanctioned Russia more than Obama.
Trump bombed Putin's ally.
Trump armed Putin's enemy.
Trump expelled Putin's diplomats.
Trump killed Russian oil with deregulation.
Is that all part of the master plan?

9631 2018-08-20 01:05:30 That's not the case in Ontario. Our electricity is generated by nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind. We don't use coal, natgas, or oil. It's still a challenge to reduce transport emissions, but that work is ongoing with more EVs, and cleaner & more efficient public transit.
9632 2018-08-20 01:05:05 That will be taken care of with the CPEC trade revenue. China needs us since we connect them to iran via land. This is important for gas and oil pipelines.

9643 2018-08-20 01:03:40 What they really are going to do is suck oil out of IRAN. New war zone is imminent. That's why the US military received billions more although it was not requested. That's also why the senior command is changing with more aggressive, partisan generals. Nothing covert here.

9657 2018-08-20 01:02:14 I heard about lemon juice or lemon extract. Have not heard olive oil. But believe me, I am taking all suggestions under advisement. This was tough stuff for this 65 year old. Thx!
9658 2018-08-20 01:02:13 It is to prove and or disprove any sexual assault to the children. Thats the reason he put his 3 & 4 year olds in oil tanks for 4 day's. He's going to prison regardless. Hut prisoner's LOVE child killer's. I hope they wipe that smirk off his face. #ChrisWatts

9660 2018-08-20 01:02:10 If you have oil build up in between facial washings, use a medicated pad or blotting paper to remove excess oil. These products have the added benefit of being portable, allowing you to freshen up your face no matter where you are.
9661 2018-08-20 01:02:01 a squeaky oil gets fed bitch so speak up
9662 2018-08-20 01:02:01 Thank you for the oil

9665 2018-08-20 01:01:08 Great job on that oil spill back in 2010, trashing the Gulf Coast and totally slacking on the cleanup.

9668 2018-08-20 01:00:41 It's not. As a matter of fact, it is long overdue.

The man traffics in half baked conspiracy theories and lately has taken to calling for violence all in the pursuit of hawking  his low rent wares.

He is a snake oil salesman and a dangerous one.

9672 2018-08-20 00:59:40 That's another thing (fracking) that I'm strongly against, but it gets more 'complicated' because it deals with "Do we want to have to depend on foreign nations for our oil/energy sources" aspect. Big battle weighing the pros & cons, but I don't like fracking. ALL politicians do.
9673 2018-08-20 00:59:39 @TSA flying from ny to fla,is my over the counter CBD oil ok to bring in my carry-on?

9698 2018-08-20 00:55:57 With proven highest oil reserves in the world, Venezuela is on brink of terrible economic crisis! It is proven time & again that although socialism as an idea is appealing but on pragmatic basis equally appalling.
9699 2018-08-20 00:55:55 Hi @chsm1th, you wrote in the Musings:
"We all know the world needs to transition away from fossil fuels..."

I don't 'know' that at all.  Why do you think it's true?  Global warming?  Peak oil?  Energy control/production too centralized?  Other reasons?
9700 2018-08-20 00:55:49 Photographers can be so strange. How you gonna get offended because I don’t wanna shoot w/ you?

9711 2018-08-20 00:54:23 No I don’t have any “medical #cannabis oil “ to cure cancer but here’s a fresh load of Tea Tree Oil that probably will do the same thing to accomplish that.  Oh and if you have head lice this will be just as effective on those little guys too!
9712 2018-08-20 00:54:22 so what are we all about?
uh caricatures of Natives, stoat guys who love oil lamps, a boat, uh the town itself...
anything more?

9713 2018-08-20 00:54:17 Market has $CVN value about right if it is just looking at Dorado, but Buffalo adds 19-36 cps & Roc is worth ~6 cps, then risked exploration value adds ~9 cps. So total risked target value is 83-97 cps if oil has in-situ value of just A$14/bbl!

9750 2018-08-20 00:49:08 Obama did that to make it falsely "appear" to have less oil coverage into the Gulf by adding billions of gallons of #Corexit "dispersant" (which only breaks up the oil & makes it impossible to remove from the water). Corexit is pure concentrated poison.
Very deceptive act.

9762 2018-08-20 00:47:02 I LIKE kale! If you find it bitter, sweeten it up by cooking it with carrots. Both veggies are low in calories, high in nutrition. You can oil your tractor’s wheels with the coconut oil and save your arteries and heart.

9768 2018-08-20 00:46:03 Don't try to reinvent the mouse trap. It works. You can  tweak it a little. Make the spring a little tighter,Add a little 3 in 1 oil. Point is-If your not getting the mice it may just be bad timing-So if you go in a slump don't start changing everything. It may just be bad timing

That damage lasts hundreds of years, yet ppl are unknowing of it. Media coverup
9776 2018-08-20 00:44:59 Trump base is being conned by a snake oil salesman who never served bc he was busy chasing women, money laundering & getting his stuff made in China but they think he is patriotic?. It’s clear that ppl with privilege are clueless about why NFL players kneel.
9777 2018-08-20 00:44:53 What on earth are you talking about? CBD oil has zero psychactive components. This it's CBD. You obviously are ill informed and have no idea about chemistry.

9795 2018-08-20 00:41:59 @ all u dry ass white mother fuckers yall lucky af bc im greasy as fuck please i look like white pizza i wanna choke i take a breath and it looks like i took an oil shower
9796 2018-08-20 00:41:43 i think it is good. are you comparing it to the western scum? are you implying Gods are ruling in west (from where you belong)? dont forget you are part of FAKE MEDIA.
9797 2018-08-20 00:41:42 Just fraud. Could have done it with coconut oil or a widget.
9798 2018-08-20 00:41:11 So you have a smaller country with more oil and smaller population yet israel is doing worse in your eyes with no oil and bigger population while dealing with wars? Lol 

Your gdp should be consistently going up not in a roller coaster, Israel’s record high was this past year
9799 2018-08-20 00:41:08 Mink oil?
9800 2018-08-20 00:41:06 VRの世界に行ったとしても、フィジカルの強さが求められたので、筋肉はあった方がいい…気がします…
9801 2018-08-20 00:40:41 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
9802 2018-08-20 00:40:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9803 2018-08-20 00:40:34 I got a 92 silverado i changed the fuel pump, fuel filter, radiator, alternator, oil pressure switch, catyllic converter.i get spark but no fire unless i use starting fluid. Ther pump isn't getting power to it. The relays and fuses are good.
9804 2018-08-20 00:40:29 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
9805 2018-08-20 00:40:25 And that's why truffle oil companies no longer sponsor episodes of Food Network's Chopped.
9806 2018-08-20 00:40:18 ぽはよう！！VRの世界で体いっぱい動かしたけど、筋トレと呼ぶには厳しい運動量でした！！進捗ダメです！！

9809 2018-08-20 00:40:01 Nope. In-dash. Temp gauges for oil, coolant and transmission (!). All factory.
9810 2018-08-20 00:39:53 thats wonderful, both china and muslims are problem.
9811 2018-08-20 00:39:52 olive oil.

9814 2018-08-20 00:39:25 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once El Trumpo starts whining, a depressed snail dreams about being a #Democrat
9815 2018-08-20 00:39:21 Olive oil or canola which do you prefer?
9816 2018-08-20 00:39:05 Less is more... Olive oil, kosher salt and pepper.   Smoking hot grill.   There will be some flame ups because of the fat, but that’s okay.  Fan them and then flip them.   And if your butcher French’s  the bone we can’t be friends.
9817 2018-08-20 00:38:58 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9818 2018-08-20 00:38:43 Check EVERY packaged product you buy. #GODIVA chocolates-palm oil. Packaged cookies and crisps-palm oil. Facial creams and lotions-palmate. Don’t buy into ANYTHING palm oil ingredients. Plus it’s really bad for your body
9819 2018-08-20 00:38:36 your stock markets hold too much prominence...your greed and business deals for oil...you will never give up
9820 2018-08-20 00:38:31 The main thing in wild that makes kingsbane work are coldlights and oil if you wanna craft them agaim tho
9821 2018-08-20 00:38:25 ぽはよう！！！

9822 2018-08-20 00:38:17 Oh my. Angular, soft, full Riesling with layers of concentrated mustard oil.
9823 2018-08-20 00:38:14 Can someone please explain to me what type of pigment I should be getting from the #notobotanics #hydrahighlighter? B/C I do not understand the point of this product. I get subtle glow but this has literally no pigment. It’s like rubbing lavender scented coconut oil on your skin
9824 2018-08-20 00:38:01 tea tree oil!
9825 2018-08-20 00:37:55 Lube and oil
9826 2018-08-20 00:37:47 Upswing in fiscal deficit, inflation and fudged books with deffrred payment liabilities on oil bonds, external payments. Not sure whom you are trying to fool sir
9827 2018-08-20 00:37:42 Cooking in the kitchen naked is all fun and games until your titty gets popped with some oil
9828 2018-08-20 00:37:39 ahora en adelante compraré crema que tenga coconut oil, me hace súper bien con mi pelo, forget about the price.

9832 2018-08-20 00:36:52 Vaccinations cause lizard-morphing! Don’t vaccinate!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
9833 2018-08-20 00:36:50 "This was the perfect recipe! I did tweak it a bit tho. Replaced the butter with coconut oil, swapped out the flour for almond flour (we're a gluten free household!), and of course a cup of sugar is just way too much, so instead I used a tablespoon of honey. :)) So perfect!"

9835 2018-08-20 00:36:13 Low jobless rate.  Economy expanding at 2.6% annually.  Oil and gas up 6.4%.  Canadian economy grew .5% in May alone.
9836 2018-08-20 00:36:06 いつもの姿と違う姿で歩けるのは素晴らしいと思います
9837 2018-08-20 00:35:59 That's no problem. Give then a good cleaning, polish, buff then mink oil. They'll be good as new
9838 2018-08-20 00:35:57 @Honda I need an oil pump for a h23a1 and you guys discontinued it, ya’ll gonna scrap or na.
9839 2018-08-20 00:35:56 This user is not interested in gold mines, oil wells, shipping, or real estate.
9840 2018-08-20 00:35:53 Can't tell if disappointed he put oil on his dick or that he has a tiny dick
9841 2018-08-20 00:35:11 This severe warning from God and me goes not ony for CBS, but for any other television network that airs such heinous and morally perverse programming. Parents who sell their children to participate in these vile shows for money will be dunked in a vat of boiling oil in
9842 2018-08-20 00:34:53 They sit on oil, if you’re trying to compare a country that was built on no oil reserves that could be utilized to one that could then I can do the same with population
9843 2018-08-20 00:34:52 My cats are living their best life. Ran out of cat food, so they're eating Jose Andres' brand white belly tuna packed in olive oil.
9844 2018-08-20 00:34:40 I suspect that in POTUS's ignorance, Syria (as an Arab country) has major oil reserves.  It, of course, does not.
9845 2018-08-20 00:34:37 おはようございます(｡ρω-｡)
9846 2018-08-20 00:34:35 I may get grief from this but.... I don't care what gender you are, just do your job.  I was a mech back in the day, and all they let me do was fuel and oil samples, or plane captaining... sucked.
9847 2018-08-20 00:34:32 可愛いニンゲンアバターを使うドラゴンさん…？
9848 2018-08-20 00:34:31 my dad was in prime dad mode today as he taught me to mow the lawn, lemme tell ya... how to make clean lines in the grass, keep the clippings off the cement, check the oil and gas
9849 2018-08-20 00:34:28 Why is it that the more 'natural' peanut butter is, the more disgusting? Whole foods 'creamy' peanut butter is full of chunks and is settled with weird oil on top and smells weird, but hey at least it's 100% organic and has no preservatives!
9850 2018-08-20 00:34:17 why I get chick-fil-a almost everytime i’m in elkton: all my life, before 2 years ago, I’ve gone without eating it bc i’m allergic to peanut butter and they cook in peanut oil so don’t judge me for wanting to catch up on all of the years i’ve missed ok
9851 2018-08-20 00:34:17 買ってくれるのー？wwww
9852 2018-08-20 00:34:08 Aloe Vera and vitamin e oil has helped me a lot
9853 2018-08-20 00:34:06 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
9854 2018-08-20 00:34:04 ....isn't this what large corporations have always done? E.g United Fruit co in central America and several oil companies in west Africa
9855 2018-08-20 00:33:54 THIS is why I keep a large bottle of lavender essential oil with my spices.
9856 2018-08-20 00:33:52 Would’ve tasted better if you sautéed it in the spices and oil, and added the hot sauce at the end and covered the pan to let it all simmer together
9857 2018-08-20 00:33:52 Iya joejoeba oil

9860 2018-08-20 00:32:54 We hope he's in the 5 to 15 range, like year before last.  What he showed last year was below 30 range for half the year and 15 to 25 range second half.  Which is the real Talbot?... will define Oil year as much as anything. Hard to ID a comp.
9861 2018-08-20 00:32:39 Light fried until soft. Basically dipped in hot oil.
9862 2018-08-20 00:32:37 "Take off your shirt and bra, and then get some of the 'special' oil, rub it on you're boobs, and have you lose yourself to the pleasure before we get to the really good stuff~"
9863 2018-08-20 00:32:35 How do we feel about CBD oil for dogs?
9864 2018-08-20 00:31:39 originally I fuckin hated it and I was bored out of my mind but it’s definitely picked up since they climbed up the oil pillar

I’d probably put it on par with part 1, because I’m really enjoying it right now
9865 2018-08-20 00:31:31 Yeah I definitely agree with you there. I went to a museum with some amazing pieces and in the corner I found a room with a canvas covered with black oil except the top right corner. This was in a room next to 15th century Immaculate depictions of religion.

9869 2018-08-20 00:30:08 Sad. Big Oil keeps on winning. No matter who the president is, money always wins the battles. When will it end?
9870 2018-08-20 00:29:37 I come home and Steven bought me sunflowers and vitamin e oil 
9871 2018-08-20 00:28:54 Need To Get My Oil Changed ASAP
9872 2018-08-20 00:28:39 Very well spoken Sir, Buhari is the most corrupt president Nigeria ever had, Minister of petroleum and president at the same time, Buhari is a big thief. Buhari looted oil money when he was PTF chairman and continue to loot till date. Buhari should be jailed for life.
9873 2018-08-20 00:28:21 Everything I cook starts in a pan with olive oil. 

I do not believe in slaving away in the kitchen.
9874 2018-08-20 00:28:21 Changed my oil, put on a spare tire and got hit on by a gay dude (transition possibly). #manshit #orwomenyouguysarequal
9875 2018-08-20 00:28:20 Nothing fancy. Bake small ones. Smash onto baking sheet (e.g. with bottom of glass). Drizzle with olive oil and minced garlic. Roast for a bit.
9876 2018-08-20 00:28:19 We don’t want Trump either but I don’t understand why anyone would prefer a monarchy over true democracy.  Your kingdom will go thru some interesting times over the next decade.  We will see how much you love your rulers as the rest of the world weans itself away from your oil.
9877 2018-08-20 00:28:19 Gorgeous. I've been working in oil & cold wax but have no idea what want sabi is LOL 
9878 2018-08-20 00:28:06  The national average #gasprice has slipped to $2.827/gallon currently- the lowest level since May 7- some 15 weeks or 105 days ago. It may fall in the coming week as oil prices continue to struggle... for now.
9879 2018-08-20 00:27:53 Like the growing water shortage, from Fracking abuses that waste millions of gallons a DAY of water, the pollution oil and gas causes for a greedy few benefit, the needless homelessness, from closed down Mental Inst. by GOP, from those Corp's now untaxed and investing offshore,
9880 2018-08-20 00:27:26 いやだー。現実に帰りたくないーっ！
9881 2018-08-20 00:27:05 Why did you chair PNAC, who said to seize oil in the Middle East we needed an attack to justify war in Iraq? In 1999!!!! You are a warmongering POS.
9882 2018-08-20 00:27:03 Like I gotta oil down tonight ya
9883 2018-08-20 00:26:52 How sad that you exhibit such an ignorance of history. You ignore his enabling the Tutsis genocide & graft/corruption of Oil  for Food scam by Iraq under UN auspices. May he end up next to Saddam in Hades.
9884 2018-08-20 00:26:44 Today my ma tried cbd oil for the first time. 

Today my ma danced to her music while dialysizing instead of groaning in pain. 

Today she at her whole dinner and got seconds. 

Today she smiled. Not through the pain and fear, really smiled

Long story short fuck the government
9885 2018-08-20 00:26:33 Quick survey for all students of micet. Do you think that Oil & Gas Safety Passport (OGSP) training is needed for your learning and career enhancement?
9886 2018-08-20 00:26:09 that would be amazing,  rare earth minerals are the oil of the electric vehicle industry.
9887 2018-08-20 00:24:47 shame on him, can govt take away all it gave to him?
9888 2018-08-20 00:24:34 Wouldn’t u know the one essential oil I have is lemongrass. I gave my daughter the patchouli. PU! And now she’s gonna get the lemongrass. And, I have tea tree oil. Thanks G ! 
9889 2018-08-20 00:24:29 NAFTA- NO; agreement with China- a bigger NO; agreement with India- still a bigger NO ; oil pipelines - NO ;higher deficits- YES; higher debt- YES; higher taxes- YES
9890 2018-08-20 00:24:26 @nytimes the spanish edition of NYT an article writed by Megan Specia afirm that economic collapse of Venezuela is because a bad administration, corruption, and low prices of oil.

9893 2018-08-20 00:24:06 I wound up reacting to MCT oil. I'm already out $1000+  Don't have the time or $$ to do this anymore.

9895 2018-08-20 00:23:32 I bought an essential oil diffuser and it just came in. Perfect ending to my weekend 
9896 2018-08-20 00:23:20 There’s almost zero sanity left in Oil Country. Ask these halfwits who they would replace him with.

9899 2018-08-20 00:21:19 The real stupidity is among his followers. You have a complete racist clown like Sharpton who has managed to become quite well off selling his snake oil to the ignorant masses.

9925 2018-08-20 00:16:02 You will never see more points controversy online than olive oil.
9926 2018-08-20 00:15:29 I replied with one but I’ll take a better one once I buy some Moroccan oil and go over it one more time
9927 2018-08-20 00:15:19 Yet Canada denies same country's investment in its oil companies. I'm calling fake news on this one.
9928 2018-08-20 00:15:19 Yeah but they ain't much better lol basically a d*ck measuring contest between all those oil countries
9929 2018-08-20 00:15:10 Last I looked, oil is not the only contributor to revenue. #itscomplicated
9930 2018-08-20 00:15:08 I don’t buy ANYTHING with palm oil in it. Everybody should read their food labels.
9931 2018-08-20 00:15:02 I didnt think it would help but always hear about coconut oil for everything 
9932 2018-08-20 00:14:55 Gonna start injecting vegetable oil into my muscles until i look like John Cena and then I’m gonna become a cage fighter.

9942 2018-08-20 00:13:00 No, Scotland's oil output has dropped year on year as well as oil prices dropping which in turn has made a sizeable deficit in contributions to the treasury. Sterling is insured by the Bank of England,if you're no longer in the union you can't use its currency.

9947 2018-08-20 00:11:34 I’m intrigued by the arrangement next to stove: olive oil, olive oil, lint roller?
9948 2018-08-20 00:11:31 Salad it’s simple dressing of @Napastak Cherry Dark Balsamic Vinegar, Grapeseed oil, salt and pepper. Served with quiche (one of my kids’ favorite)
9949 2018-08-20 00:11:30 My understanding is that British and American intelligence overthrew Mossedegh because he was sympathetic to the USSR. 

Oil may have been a minor factor but mainly it was the Cold War.

Repeat: this was done to keep the USSR from taking control.

9954 2018-08-20 00:11:16 Twiggy Forrest says "You don't put the rabbits in charge the cabbage!"; So why does the oil & gas industry run marine parks and The University of Western Australia? #HushMoney #Greenwashing #wapol #insiders #perthnews @sffAustralia University of WA integrity questioned

9961 2018-08-20 00:10:06 RT @LS_Nutrition: #Safflower Oil this August? It can interact with #Anticoagulant, #Antiplatelet and other drugs. Check with your #MD!
9962 2018-08-20 00:09:59 Unfortunately, I don't cook with details. Three different chiles (2 dried one fresh), a bunch of garlic, thyme, paprika . . . um . . . olive oil, oh yeah, apple cider vinegar, onion powder in a blender. Marinade. Hope this helps!
9963 2018-08-20 00:09:57 Thanks @SheaRacing  she had a blast!   See you next year!  Reagan loves that you posted this.
9964 2018-08-20 00:09:52 Time to bring the “Mother-ship” down. My former pastor graduated from TMS, worked as a youth pastor for JMAC’s church. Had a fine oil painting from JMAc & signed by him in the church office he abused me in. They produce cold religious/unethical leaders.

9969 2018-08-20 00:09:18 Mostly making glasses of whiskey with a little water. For the carrots, I put olive oil and a little cayenne on them, roast then for 30 minutes at 375, flip them, sprinkle with goat cheese, and roast another 20 minutes. Think Elote' but with carrots. Street carrots.
9970 2018-08-20 00:09:16 #Warning: If you're eating lots of sugary, refined foods, they could be contributing to your breakouts. They don’t directly cause acne but they do exacerbate oil production on the face.
9971 2018-08-20 00:08:52 Sometime change isn't always for the better. My daughter has a 2012 A4 that has oil consumption issues worse than my old 2.8 had.
9972 2018-08-20 00:08:46 Simple breakfast! Scrambled with spinach cooked in Jalapeño olive oil with a side of  fried sweet potato all with a variety of seasonings! 
9973 2018-08-20 00:08:45 Someone please wife me up. I’ve cleaned, cooked supper, & changed my oil so you didn’t have to.  I’m honestly really great.
9974 2018-08-20 00:08:42 If you really want to ramp up healing time and stabilize mood at the same time 1tbl spoon of walnut oil /day + an algae/vegan omega 3 (non-fish oil type). Those, in combination, supply omega 3/6/9 like a boss. Avoid choline / citicoline if possible, it settles in wounded tissues.

9980 2018-08-20 00:07:53 If the good people of BC were taking steps to stop all oil imports and quit dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into their waters, I might see their point, but all I see is a bunch of left wing assholes being paid off by more left wing assholes.

9984 2018-08-20 00:07:25 On #SocialistSunday I would like to remember every person who died in the Russian gulag, Nazi death camps, Maoist prisons, and Khymer Rouge killing fields. Also, the millions of Venezuelans who are starving today in a country with huge oil reserves.
9985 2018-08-20 00:07:25 Has anyone else seen Huckabee on the TBN network?  It is The Beverly Hillbillies without the oil. @HoarseWisperer @ManInTheHoody
9986 2018-08-20 00:07:18 True, but it is illegal in our area, and getting the right strain to help your particular problem becomes the problem. CBD oil is legal, but it doesn't have the benefits of THC, and around here, you still don't know what is mixed with it. #Painmatters

9989 2018-08-20 00:07:05 How about oil, chemicals, & gas in your drinking & bathing water due to fracking? They have already accomplished that in big chucks of Texas. That's why @BetoORourke will win Texas.
9990 2018-08-20 00:06:59 Most likely oil or gas-we MUST END Citizen United!! Our Democracy is at stake if we don't!! Senator Scott of SC also received almost 600,000 from gas, oil-wrote the letter to trump to pull out of the Paris Agreement-we CANNOT allow this ANY more!
9991 2018-08-20 00:06:24 Its depends on what type of paint it is but for the most part oil based soap, or just oil should work. You could also just go the route my dad does and use gasoline that removes everything.
9992 2018-08-20 00:05:58 Oil for food program!
9993 2018-08-20 00:05:39 Perhaps You mean the Anti-Mossadeq-Coup in IRAN..? I was still a small child, but I distinctly remember my Dad saying: "It is all about the OIL.!"... I do remember my surprise at the disapproving tone my Dad used against our Liberators! NOW I know why!
9994 2018-08-20 00:05:23 Saudi Barbaria can behead & crucify anyone & everyone as far as the US Govt is concerned because of oil & money & the Barbarians’ alliance with Israel.  @JackPosobiec @CassandraRules @MaxBlumenthal @PearsonSharp @RonPaulInstitut @PrisonPlanet   Disgraceful but true.

10004 2018-08-20 00:02:53 Any other CEO would've taken the money. I wouldn't rule out the possibility Elon refused it out of arrogance/recklessness. Probably wouldn't have looked great taking money from big oil either. But he's a little more desperate now.
