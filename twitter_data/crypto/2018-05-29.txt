42 2018-05-29 23:56:13 The swiss frank was never mass adopted and worked as safe haven... The swiss (the banks not the people)are very open minded about crypto,  which by itself its not a coincidence... I'm not betting on it,  but is another possibility out of very few

8. We're early in the crypto evolution and even earlier when it comes to consensus mechanisms. There's a chance that the first ever distributed consensus mechanism (PoW) is the best but I find that hard to believe given the pace of technological progress.

51 2018-05-29 23:55:04 #bitcoin bears disappeared fast with the $btc to 4000 posts. Truth is bitcoin isnt going anywhere. Theres too much demand for #crypto now and we are just beginning to scratch the surface of the potential uses. Whether it goes up or down in the near term, btc is here to stay
52 2018-05-29 23:54:51 No doubt!  But you understand my point immediately knowing how busy your schedule is with requests for contract work.  Open source work can't look appealing, especially when crypto communities can be so caustic.  Cheers!
53 2018-05-29 23:54:51 Appreciate the clarification Peter. Different data feeds in #Crypto can be a challenge at times but GDAX 109 & 101.40 seem to be important horizontal levels to watch.

114 2018-05-29 23:45:06 Can't be a safe haven.. Too far from mass adoption. What prices will have crypto if  3-5exchanges with USD close their doors? Who will accept my crypto and for what price?
115 2018-05-29 23:45:03 Hello. I've been lurking on crypto twitter for months. Today feels like a good day to step out of the shadows. $crypto
116 2018-05-29 23:44:50 Just my opinion...  At this point in $BTC's market position relative to external trade and fiat currencies, I doubt Chinese government has a major incentive to do so yet.   I believe China's main interest in controlling #crypto is internal to China.
117 2018-05-29 23:44:30 Because it's not luck anymore. It's work, audience, and calibration.

"Crypto" + a large audience to kickstart the exposure of the app will always lead to some kind of unexpected results nowadays.

Congrats  keep it up !

125 2018-05-29 23:43:21 I'm becoming a fan of yours. Penny by penny. Dragon by dragon.
126 2018-05-29 23:42:46 @crypto_butlers, among many others, have advocated for a strategy of buying top-100 coins that have fallen substantially since January. I finally agree with them. Just because something had a pump a while back doesn’t mean it can’t go on a 3-5x rally.
127 2018-05-29 23:42:41 Oh god no. The only thing that went up in price because of crypto is graphics cards. There are a lot of good pre-built options out there for like $1k. Mine has some upgraded parts that aren’t necessity. I also have a 2 monitor set up.
128 2018-05-29 23:42:34 1) Either crypto will win via legal security tokens like @neufundorg or via @monerocurrency dark currency.  trickle-down cryptoeconomy

134 2018-05-29 23:42:03 Also human error is just human error; what’s nice about blockchain is the trustlessness because while to err is human to scam is also human

149 2018-05-29 23:38:57 I work in a major bank and one of the battles everyday is the bugs in the software. The bugs and limitations justifiably piss of the clients and also make our jobs harder and when we call tech they just unsuccessfully troubleshoot and then pass the buck onto the next department..

#1 Only put in what you can afford to lose.

155 2018-05-29 23:37:26 Welcome to twitter/crypto lol
156 2018-05-29 23:36:55 We have an influential free thinker in crypto. We love your anti system stance. Larger crypto becomes mainstream, the larger the influence (and responsibility) u have. Ur brand is crucial. The system looks at crypto as a joke already , u don't help with ur objectifying of woman.
157 2018-05-29 23:36:53 A return to 300 sats would make me a very happy boy

161 2018-05-29 23:35:55 Lately I've been listening to a lot of crypto TA videos on YouTube; the other day a psychic talking about crypto came up on the recommended feed!... turns out there is almost no difference between the two in the techniques to gaslight and manipulate the audience verbally.
162 2018-05-29 23:35:48 スーツにリュックのスタイルあまり好きじゃない。
163 2018-05-29 23:35:45 Haha! VERY true... but McDs dollar menu = best price/nutrients ratio out there (tryin to keep crypto peeps well fed - this crowd is way too into ramen...) 
164 2018-05-29 23:35:41 Don’t spread #FUD on banks !  haha
165 2018-05-29 23:35:37 The problem is there were no massive regular selloffs. Current BTC trading volume is so low (actually as low as by the end of 2016) that price is falling/increasing thanks to that very low volume trades by regular investors.

175 2018-05-29 23:33:59 But many of ICO’s are such shit ;). I know guys in Asia throw money on everything crypto related, but it’s not sound. Asia has it’s dot com bubble now. Europe and US is different IMO. What do you think?
176 2018-05-29 23:33:47 Says a cherry thrasher!

いやいや、控えてほしいとかって意図は全くないです。

ちょこっと修正するだけだし変にScriptを公開する必要もないかな、と思っていたのですが、たしかに気楽に使えた方が良いですね。ちょっとTVで公開できるようにします。
178 2018-05-29 23:33:16 What 3 hacks? There were only two mining exploits which were fixed in record time.
179 2018-05-29 23:33:06 Lots of say it will go up more ? But i Afraid more from drop  i pass dolar now when everything is green
180 2018-05-29 23:32:32 Ah, I didn't know #zcash is rolling their crypto. But the discussion from leaked mails between MIT DCI and IOTA "crypto" team. It seems IOTA guys either try to avoid the answer or they have no idea what are they really doing.

182 2018-05-29 23:31:57 Fair point, however once the error is identified and corrected the code will never make that same mistake again.  Humans make the same error across the globe thousands of times every day.

184 2018-05-29 23:31:35 Bitcoin Prices Rise; Six Japanese Companies Set to Launch Crypto Exchanges -
185 2018-05-29 23:31:34 Tinfoil hatting hard I see. Where was the cartel in 2015 when the price dropped 87%? That's just how bubble works.Thinking that an asset will constantly go up forever without correction is retarded. Did the cartel pop the .com bubble? The markets in 1929?
186 2018-05-29 23:31:18 That or people realized what you do and gained respect for your craft. As a BTC bull felt a little angered the last couple of days, pretty sure it will arise again, but still not has happy as the days of 20k. I would wake up and my portfolio would be up thousands no more tho.
187 2018-05-29 23:30:39 So basicallyyyyy when you’re ready to jump off a cliff, just buy even more #crypto + likely the very next day you’ll be happy with your decision. 
188 2018-05-29 23:30:33 We love you too Satoshi Nakamoto
189 2018-05-29 23:30:21 I find it interesting how coinbase is the gateway to investing in future technology/cryptography..... yet my money takes 8 days to get there. Crypto - "lightning fast transactions."   I assume the banks need to adopt it for this to take place?
190 2018-05-29 23:29:44 You must know though that many who invest in crypto and especially in the Ethereum ecosystem, don’t try to find the next gold 2.0, don’t see eth and ERC20 tokens as “sound money” and frankly have different expectations for what the platform should be.
191 2018-05-29 23:29:32 only ever put in what you can afford to lose rule #1 in crypto 
Rule #2 Be patient
192 2018-05-29 23:29:30 @binance insiders always get a heads up of a listing pump over there.
193 2018-05-29 23:29:25 That didn't happen in the American crypto exchanges till mid last year.
Their background is way shady that you can imagine, especially polo.
194 2018-05-29 23:29:23 Yeah. I hate that Kaep still has his job.

201 2018-05-29 23:28:10 Gamers uncritically jumping to the crypto-fascists with over the top uniforms and big guns (if it's the East Coast setting)? There's no precedent for that!
202 2018-05-29 23:27:52 It's just looming larger than it should, and it kind of deserves to, since the 2017 cohort's influx was largely due to an unregulated copy of the existing VC structure, latching on to the existing $crypto infrastructure that enabled it to grow so crazy cancer-fast

205 2018-05-29 23:27:27 .@triplejHack did you know that banks & payment gateways such as @PayPal are refusing service to completely legal, tax paying businesses in Australia, purely on moral grounds? @KateCarnellAus has weighed in on this issue & @intimatetoken is using crypto to empower the industry.
206 2018-05-29 23:27:27 Has your twitter account been compromised? Looks like a crypto currency scam.
207 2018-05-29 23:27:20 @officialmcafee my other account @swazers101 was recently destroyed by @TwitterSupport .I hadn't done anything wrong, all I can think of is because of my crypto chatter? Seems extremely unfair.
208 2018-05-29 23:27:01 Enterprise adoption equals a greater pool of people invested in crypto.  Everyone wins?

272 2018-05-29 23:18:18 #CryptoPuzzle 13: Which of these is more painful than a 5 month bear market?
a) Knowing you bought in at the peak of the bull market
b) Remembering the moment you considered selling at the peak
c) A paper cut
d) When you're a banker and you realize crypto is coming for your job

303 2018-05-29 23:14:18 There's a bunch of problems with uasf. But, I never thought it would be accepted by exchanges/wallets/etc. And without energy securing consensus rules, you end up with a split network...
304 2018-05-29 23:14:08 Thank you !
305 2018-05-29 23:14:03 Woops, misunderstood there! It sure is, hopefully some exchanges become a bit more open to PoWs. Unfortunately with the current state of the game (i.e all the scam coins going around), PoW coins dont have the best of reps, so I can understand where the exchanges are coming from
306 2018-05-29 23:13:45 Basic difference between #fiatcurrency and #cryptocurrency is this: Fiat currency is created as debt while the crypto is created without debt.
307 2018-05-29 23:13:37 A hint would be nice ;) you know I’m into this crypto stuff :)
308 2018-05-29 23:13:04 Blockchain technology has the potential to transform life as we know it today.  It won’t happen this year or next, but eventually the challenges will be overcome and it will bleed into everything with which we interact. Code eliminates human error, our biggest societal downfall.

312 2018-05-29 23:12:53 Goldman Sachs will definitely be the big winner from crypto in the long run. This is what they do.
313 2018-05-29 23:12:40 I do.  And I get your point.  That's just reality - I rely on the code others create and that I can't really verify.  Avg guys like me have to use heuristics and listen to a broad range of knowledgeable folks.  Then make a best possible decision but MY decision none the less.
314 2018-05-29 23:12:24 Love your daily threads, keep em going mate!

425 2018-05-29 22:59:27 if you lost your account in crypto twitter it's because of the free $ETH scam. 100% no doubt. Nobody is talking about this though.
426 2018-05-29 22:59:23 average sure... but if you are investing in a solid project, the ROI is much more
427 2018-05-29 22:59:19 I would buy an expensive house so that I could for sure have a home but for almost my entire life then invest in houses to rent to others and live off of the rent money they give me while still having a bit in crypto

433 2018-05-29 22:58:39 This is what Decentralization is. There were at least two America's at one point. If not thirteen. At some point the real Bitcoin will need a defense force to protect the brand I guess.

444 2018-05-29 22:56:32 Guys, this man is a fraud. Understand that his posts are strictly to generate likes or a retweet. Nothing he says is valuable. Most of his shilling was done because companies saw he had some followers in crypto and they thought he could bring in more buyers in his rented suit.

446 2018-05-29 22:56:26 I don’t think people understand the value you own as an early crypto investor. The past has been centralized. Central governments, banks, cooperations, and even schools. Giving a small group of people all of the power to make desions that affect millions isn’t right.

Crypto is scary and dark. It’s anti-America. I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That’s why I went with #Ripple.

460 2018-05-29 22:55:25 Twitter seriously?? So your sauce is saying that PG a regulated company will transfer money to Chinese firms at a period China launched a crackdown last year on crypto. Let's reason this please. It's too good to be true man.
461 2018-05-29 22:55:25 The problem with only having one Bitcoin is that we are asking exchanges to choose which of the 500 bitcoins is the real Bitcoin. If you remove the choice from consumers, then, the Bitcoin that courts favor with exchanges will be the real Bitcoin.

466 2018-05-29 22:54:47 That sounds amazing, and is a great plan. Even when crypto is going through some rough patches, I like to think about this type of thing. It can be fun. We never know what will really happen in crypto. But, without dreams, life is just boring. :-)

481 2018-05-29 22:52:20 sorry for the really basic question, but interested in placing an options contract on a number of property stocks (UK). Can someone recommend a suitable platform that allows for this? Never done this before 
e.g. a 12 month put option on Savills (expires May 2019)
482 2018-05-29 22:52:06 If I want to buy ge stock I buy ge stock.  If I want a usd I know what it looks like.  Same with gold.  Gold is gold.  500 bitcoins calling themselves the true Bitcoin on the same hash algo?  Confusing.  It hurts adoption.  It waters down everything.
483 2018-05-29 22:51:53 The crypto markets are full of people more concerned about being right and looking good than making money, so I wouldn't worry about it haha. They're too busy buying the top and shorting the bottom to care about "probabilities"
484 2018-05-29 22:51:44 I think that asics probably skewed the check and balance in favor of the miners a bit too much. I'm even ok with that, but it's a bit illusory. The whole blockchain calculus is out the window ATM, until censorship happens
485 2018-05-29 22:51:18 However, #blockchain technology needs to be simplified to people who have difficulty with technology. Helping them will go a long way and build confidence at a larger scale with the community.

496 2018-05-29 22:48:29 Well, it's obviously on the table. Economies of scale applies to Asics. I'm a-ok with this definition, but it means ~20 people get to decide what Bitcoin is. So, now what's more Decentralized, Bitcoin, or... the municipal pool?

552 2018-05-29 22:39:05 Big exchanges only add coins on ground floor. Bittrex proved that again with the $ocn listing today. If you didn't think these exchanges are the biggest insider traders in crypto, you're naive. My point is if your coin pumps big, dont keep holding because 'binance listing soon!'

Revolut just isn't a crypto app.  They overextended (IMO) into that sphere without thinking it through... not a scam...

684 2018-05-29 22:17:40 I think the recent crypto downturn was due partially (mostly?) to people taking money out of play before the holiday weekend. I wonder how strongly correlated crypto market performance is with holidays?

727 2018-05-29 22:10:38 I love the argument that crypto currencies have no real world use.... apparently everyone forgot about the stocks and bonds they hold which ACTUALLY have no real world application.... when was the last time you bought something with a share?

Yesterday's poll indicates that over 70% of you do not read a crypto blog and/or news site regularly.

What do you need to make you feel comfortable reading a Blog regularly?

790 2018-05-29 21:59:00 I don't accept that inclusion and utility are at odds. Nor do I accept that competition is at odds with utility. I want all the world's investors included in the Bitcoin community, so that our army is the largest.
791 2018-05-29 21:58:40 wow...just looked at the crypto market cap today...$329 Billion...was $305 Billion last night. That’s a $24 Billion injection in less than a day...pretty bullish if you ask me.
792 2018-05-29 21:58:27 Amen to that 
793 2018-05-29 21:57:32 スマホで事故ったとかスマホ守ったために凍結した道路で転倒して怪我とか、そんなをニュース見てると人間の命の重さってスマホ並みなのかなと思ってしまう
794 2018-05-29 21:57:27 however misguided many efforts in crypto-land are, the sheer number of engineers, brainpower (note i do not mention capital) & inquisitive minds working on technology solutions to innovate around the concept of *money*, assets, asset formation, asset servicing is notable. /1
795 2018-05-29 21:57:24 I spent this evening with @nodeunlock on their 2 hours training arranged by Finding X in London. @nodeunlock team members have some good ideas regarding crypto infrastructure and building their own crypto with an installation of there build. Lots of information given. :)
796 2018-05-29 21:57:12 ok buddy, I have a bag of it too but Im not that delusional.

812 2018-05-29 21:55:07 Crypto,
Again with the Fake news stories. These stories are made up and have been circulated for years by Regressives and Deplorables and now they have seen it so often that they consider it common knowledge.
You won't find any bonifide news sources confirming any of this stuff.

816 2018-05-29 21:54:01 Maybe take it as potential confirmation of said support? Twitter sentiment has been a solid contra-indicator and rampant aggression towards any mention of a change in trend seems to precede significant reversals.

Then again, crypto twitter is a truculent lot...

831 2018-05-29 21:51:03 I noticed Alts move at a factor of 3.52 avg in relation to $BTC so a 3.9% avg move in Btc like today, moved alts 14% avg. In the coming months if BTC goes down to around 4300 (-42%) from current levels, using the same 3.52 factor alts will be down about -150%..Thoughts? #bitcoin

842 2018-05-29 21:49:26 We were having a discussion about crypto with Uranus just a small element of the topic, and you somewhat hijacked the discussion and changed it completely. I think we all made our points and we should leave it here

874 2018-05-29 21:43:42 There's one coin in crypto that's in a league of its own just in terms of partnerships and enterprise adoption. It probably has more partnerships than the other coins COMBINED. If you're not hodling it, let alone as the majority of your portfolio, you better reevaluate your life.
875 2018-05-29 21:43:37 There are only two crypto currency stocks that can be bought on Robinhood, that’s lame.
876 2018-05-29 21:43:19 to fix that... most of your favorite crypto influencers will have to pass the microphone (to none white, none asian guys) and or focus on less supernerd products....
877 2018-05-29 21:43:02 Chosen because on low timeframes these levels act as support and resistance, not really bullish or bearish per se.
878 2018-05-29 21:42:54 Yes. Very good time to buy a properly sized portfolio of #Crypto assets. Also great time to look at private investments in the infrastructure that will enable #Blockchain technology. And best time of all to begin exploring Security Tokens...
879 2018-05-29 21:42:47 Yes, it’s all logical. Lol When they realize that IOTA is a superior tech, they just attack the IOTA community personally. The #Crypto-world is kinda like politics: it’s a blood-sport.

922 2018-05-29 21:37:40 Closer inspection gave the answer. Respect given. I assumed you were another self aggrandising "crypto" expert. I stand corrected. :)
923 2018-05-29 21:37:40 It's fun to scroll down on #Telegram and to see old conversation with CEO's or team members from multiple great projects. It makes me realize what a great market #crypto is. The accessibility from these multi-million dollar companies is amazing.

939 2018-05-29 21:34:46 This is ridiculous, there are two zodiacs, he's talking about the Sidereal zodiac mainly used in Vedic astrology, seldom used in western astrology. It's valid view point, just not one I am particularly interested in.

948 2018-05-29 21:33:28 Being a crypto personality, you are exposed to the bipolar emotions and behaviors people express toward you, based on the markets movements. In short, most crypto speculators behave like tantrum throwing, or candy-euphoria fueled kids visiting Disneyland. #itsthenatureofthegame

956 2018-05-29 21:31:44 Crypto teaches you to not care about losing vast sums of money. 
957 2018-05-29 21:31:36 I don't understand. You win money with transaction as a financial company. You don't help people or defend the crypto money. So why ask donation??

959 2018-05-29 21:31:04 The ultimate twitter mode is crypto-sarcasm: expressing derision for something while concealing the rationale and author's own views, thereby granting immunity from counter-attack.

972 2018-05-29 21:29:17 The beauty of trading crypto is that machines haven’t totally taken over, yet anyway. Human emotions are much easier to analyze with technical analysis.

986 2018-05-29 21:26:39 But anyway, Revolut does not allow you to use real crypto, does it? You can neither deposit it nor withdraw. Completely KYC'd & AML'd and centralized.

989 2018-05-29 21:25:53 I'm hearing many sources from physic/remote viewing people that crypto will end the year much higher. I think Uranus in Taurus will usher in a big tech breakthrough late Summer/Fall. I think mid-July as the peak of the bear trend, then up with crashes until 2019 bear trend again

Hocam bu öğrenilmiş bir yanılsama.

Karşılık göstermeye falan gerek yok. 
BTC nin kendisi bir karşılık zaten.

Değer olarak genel kabul gören herşey bir karşılık olur zaten. BTC de bu yolda.

Altına asıl değer veren şey de kabul değeridir, metal olarak dandiktir.

998 2018-05-29 21:23:53 Hmm. You didn't answer my question. The "perversion of justice" to you is capital punishment, which is illegal in the UK. So, all that would be left is life in prison for what these pedophile rapists did. Is that too much for you? Is that what I'm understanding?

1002 2018-05-29 21:22:52 You list so many terrible projects. If you really care for the existence of crypto in the future start to list quality projects like Particl. The whole crypto industry gets destroyed by terrible projects. If this industry is destroyed, your exchange will also not exist anymore.

1053 2018-05-29 21:15:00 Shout out to all Crypto OGs:  appreciate all the Free advice you sling, but the thing I’m struggling with as a semi-crypto noob is how do I follow the Golden Rule of Crypto?  DYOR...willing to put in the work but could use some direction.
1054 2018-05-29 21:14:56 Sadly I’m beginning to use those bot-doppelgänger as a measure of how big or influential the crypto people/projects are. Can’t take you seriously if you don’t have a fake give away

1070 2018-05-29 21:13:21 Totally agree. No matter how convinced I am that I should go long/short with a large position, I always start with a smaller position and either double down when I’m right or cut my losses when I’m wrong. Happy to lose small and frequently but occasionally win big.
1071 2018-05-29 21:13:09 In my last Buissnes trip i wannin Armenia , and there was a big sign of #btc , i was in a taxi and missed to take a photo , crypto is spreading everywhere. #trx #xrp
1072 2018-05-29 21:12:56 Encore une fois je suis d'accord avec ce que vous dites, mais votre phrase 'la blockchain est une famille de technologie inspirée du Bitcoin' n'est toujours pas valable à mon sens. Mais je comprends votre raisonnement à présent 
1073 2018-05-29 21:12:50 I thought the whole point of crypto twitter was to counter trade retailers? Or am I missing the point?

1147 2018-05-29 21:04:45 I think the moral of the story is to do your own research into Cryptocurrency as this market is not for everyone and it takes discipline. At one point BTC was at $1000 then crashed to $100 before making an ATH. Crypto is here to stay.
1148 2018-05-29 21:04:39 I'm genuinely interested in knowing where you draw the line at justice with this case Tommy reported on. Simply being held in a cell for a few decades is still too merciful for what they did, and will most certainly continue doing. What kind of punishment would be too much?

1169 2018-05-29 21:02:41 Sure, it's a game, UX is king. But the user pays with BTC and receives BTC back to his cold wallet (on-chain) whenever he wants. Adding tokens to represent value is absolutely unnecessary, since BTC will be able to be transferred really almost for free between game nodes.

1176 2018-05-29 21:01:56 Just when I feel confident enough to start shorting, Biffinex stops working with all American and American residents. I have a question to ask. Do you know any place where we can short crypto in the USA except for Metatrader?

1180 2018-05-29 21:01:17 ...What will it take for ur citizens to recognize reporting heinous crimes is necessary for ppl to be aware of the collusion of the gov/police with these gangs?

1214 2018-05-29 20:56:25 Took a quick look and all that add additional friction to just using bitcoin and running a lightning node in-game to do the transactions part with all parties in the game, totally p2p and frictionless - user is free to do as he wishes with his funds
1215 2018-05-29 20:56:20 Yeah those alts bags are pretty heavy. 
1216 2018-05-29 20:56:11 Maybe no one gives a shit about OG's. I've learnt that some people have been in bitcoin since the start yet they never ramble why they deserve respect and everyone should look up to them. All my trades have been done without "OGs" and I'm doing well! Get over yourself.
1217 2018-05-29 20:55:57 A really wise decision of you two. Only yesterday I had posted that I wish the Crypto community closer together rather than constantly to fight each other. Maybe you have laid a foundation today.

1223 2018-05-29 20:54:42 There was a backlash from a lot of people invested in $OCN. Those people did not feel that you are credible or really an influencer at all, and therefore would negatively affect the potential of $OCN. That is why you are no longer an advisor.

1265 2018-05-29 20:49:20 I was thinking, maybe there should be a direct deposit crypto currency to African kids or Indian villages, with the power of block chain....
1266 2018-05-29 20:49:08 It’s certainly high risk. I would say in many cases investing is a gamble. You win some you lose some. There will be a few great winners and a lot of losers in crypto. Those that have invested in XRP will IMO experience similar to Amazon investors.

1296 2018-05-29 20:45:18 The hate that comes to some OG's is for the ones that act so jaded and "too cool for school" or those that act like they DO know it all and can't be bothered by all the plebs.  I get that noobs can be annoying, but everyone (even OG's) had to start somewhere.  Share the knowledge

1305 2018-05-29 20:43:33 I am here for the lambos. The first 6 months in crypto I get insane profits, the last 6 I burned half of them in shitty ICOs and masternodes. Still very much up. I trade shitcoins in 10+ exchanges. I used to be called spoofy

1312 2018-05-29 20:42:41 I tell you this, “crypto is not for everyone “
1313 2018-05-29 20:42:34 Oh god you got pitched this!? I've seen this advertised on some of the crypto things I read -- surprised Anthropologie isn't offering it at those prices.

1315 2018-05-29 20:42:27 Hot take:

Most of the Millenials that complain endlessly about boomers are themselves crypto boomers. 
They have the same hedonistic disposition to life that they complain of in boomers.

However, they were born in a time when hedonism doesn't work and bitter it did for boomers.

Portals don't exist, mind-speak is fake, and there are no magic powers. It's this way of thinking that holds the field of cryptozoology back.

1416 2018-05-29 20:27:09 The next crypto pump I’m selling EVERYTHING and buying back at the dip. I missed out on way too much money just holding! F that!!

1418 2018-05-29 20:26:37 Failures are great for the Bitcoin science. I just believe it's not a very interesting project and I would much rather have a cool game just accept Bitcoin (in a lightning node wallet included) as a form of in-game coin for the users to move the economy w/o additional friction.

1420 2018-05-29 20:26:24 2020 that's when the early major wave hit or about the 30% population getting into crypto.
1421 2018-05-29 20:26:22 I like the pragmatic approach of Tokens giving users the ability to earn their first crypto, BAT @AttentionToken, EARN @balajis and Vevue @govevue - all with working products ready to launch/begin scaling soon.
1422 2018-05-29 20:26:06 Hey man. I'm just stating my experience w my transactions. Along w these premiums @coinbase also adds a flat transaction fee!... and I can't directly buy $xrp. Just saying.
1423 2018-05-29 20:25:44 @clif_high Hi Clif. You should keep up with Crypto and the economy changes in the World. You have been right all the time and should take glory in the support and help you given to many followers. You have my support and big thanks from Sweden. Clif you are the man.
1424 2018-05-29 20:25:41 I swear there is a lot of dumb mf’s in crypto
1425 2018-05-29 20:25:38 Very excited for the future of #cryptocurrency despite the downtrending current market.
1426 2018-05-29 20:25:21 25 million crypto users, using a 8 billion world population that's like 3%.  We hit 13.5% early adopters late this year to early 2019 we're looking at above 1 trillion.  By 2020 would should be looking at a 3 trillion market at least.
1427 2018-05-29 20:25:20 You also deserve the “crustographer” title for embedding crypto with rustgo
1428 2018-05-29 20:25:10 That's conservative! The team are doing a good job at spreading the word and marketing matters. Real life applicable blockchain solution means real world utility...we are not talking moon here but it's much...much higher than what it is now @BezopNetwork

1433 2018-05-29 20:24:36 Greece, Italy, Brexit, the nation state fiat currencies are just loving the political/economic chaos right now huh! Crypto has the potential to stabilize currencies in the future with a system based on verification and not faith.
1434 2018-05-29 20:23:31 The headline to this article was misleading. He believes that *ICOs* are in a bubble because of all the scammy ICOs out there. He did *not* say cryptocurrencies in general are in a bubble. That is a huge difference. #crypto #ICO

1445 2018-05-29 20:22:17 Its shows a lack of intelligence and little awareness of the world we live in. People living in the categories that society has put them in, each trying to be the best jew, catholic, blackman, white man or muslim. Keep things simple...be the best human! #weareallone

1447 2018-05-29 20:21:58 Just got word that the crypto project Gifto,$GTO has HUGE market shifting news coming in June.  At these current price levels it's an absolute steal right now and a guaranteed 2x in the short-term.

1492 2018-05-29 20:15:47 No API option for polo, unfortunately. And yes, they recently updated their KYC (b/c @circlepay aqui) but I was under the impression that only blocked future trading, which would be reasonable.

Restricting access to prior data that your account generated is an abusive polity IMO

1539 2018-05-29 20:10:01 poor prioritization by the PMs? incapable technologists? or maybe the crypto scams are driving metrics useful for short-term quarterly reports
1540 2018-05-29 20:10:01 He hardly shilled $hat (hawala today) on YouTube, twitter, etc. Guess what? It was an exit scam. Sad
1541 2018-05-29 20:09:57 The Breitman's are the true crypto SCAM couple. "Donations" LOL.
1542 2018-05-29 20:09:39 Another attack going on on $XVG? Staying away from that puppy :)

I can test if those tweets get retweeted here @devnullius

1551 2018-05-29 20:08:31 Pleased someone else thinks the same way I do. Suspicious of crypto since the start but got flamed for it.
1552 2018-05-29 20:08:20 I think you *might* be wasting your time trying to reason with an imbecile who refers to Tommy Robinson as a “hero”
1553 2018-05-29 20:08:08 You’re obviously an intelligent person, so please understand my point here. It is up to the courts to decide on guilt, not the individual. This is not about freedom of speech. It is about stopping the perversion of the course of justice.

1584 2018-05-29 20:04:17 Today I moved out of my last set of coins $TRST from @BittrexExchange . It was the first exchange I signed up to trade, lots of good memories. Alas, a good exchange has come down to this.. I wish them all the best in the future.
1585 2018-05-29 20:04:13 The question is: who is attacking cryptos? And why?
When you know that answer, you also know why FB, Goog, etc stopped allowing all crypto-related ads on their platforms
1586 2018-05-29 20:03:49 I genuinely find it bizarre that you are all so quick to hyper focus on a bogus charge of "contempt of the court", believing it's the compassionate and best response when dealing with horrific ppl. You completely dismiss the context of everything I'm saying. And it's a shame.

1599 2018-05-29 20:02:03 Do you not find it strange why the media is trying to justify covering up what was clearly a horrific case with the perpetrators walking free? You do realize that gov officials at the highest levels r satanic right? Look at the Jimmy Seville case. No doubt the judge is in on it.

1673 2018-05-29 19:53:09 @K_AdurojaTVC In addendum crypto-currency is just a "democratisation of financial systems" and empowering of you and I as we programmers did with the Internet in the late 90s/early 2000s. Its now possible for you to open a shop or advertise online.

1708 2018-05-29 19:48:30 Today was a coincidence. There's been much stronger down days for stocks this year in which crypto was also down (massacred in fact) e.g. Feb/2 and Feb/5. You are turning your own bias into a narrative.
1709 2018-05-29 19:48:17 Decentralization and censorship resistance are what make a cryptocurrency useful. Bitcoin cannot be controlled by Rchilds or anyone. That’s its intrinsic value. ETH is intrinsically worthless because Vitalik controls it - not a cryptocurrency - it’s a crypto token.

1719 2018-05-29 19:47:09 Yes, and the crypto currency should be called “in your dreams”
1720 2018-05-29 19:47:05 $THETA and $CVC loving it.
1721 2018-05-29 19:46:51 i have an old position in $OCN, but yesterday night i wanted to put a buy order at 170 sats. instead i postponed it . crypto trading is about being patient and decisive at the same time, which is a very thin line. this is a very important lesson to learn and a very hard one...
1722 2018-05-29 19:46:50 But it's ten and not 9.5 because it works reasonably well and was built that way initially; and changing it to 9.5 now would be difficult and pointless.
1723 2018-05-29 19:46:39 Nuraphones, weird design but really comfortable. In ear highs and overhear lows, makes your bones shake
1724 2018-05-29 19:46:37 There is nothing to show me.  If it’s legit than you’ll have a highly successful token. I think there is a market for crypto in fitness. I think u r just taking shortcuts. It’s a shame.
1725 2018-05-29 19:46:36 Olacaktır.
1726 2018-05-29 19:46:27 I don’t know why but I don’t like this hyped coin. I feel like it’s like dogcoin and people are buying it to hopefully ride the wave. It gives the crypto world a bad name
1727 2018-05-29 19:46:15 Nine and a half minutes could have probably been chosen instead of ten and the system would likely still work reasonably well. One minute is too short  because of latency, one hour is too long because of confirmation times.
1728 2018-05-29 19:46:14 The money is in blockchain tech, keep your opinions about crypto, they’re all irrelevant. When did you stop being an “entertainment mogul”?

1754 2018-05-29 19:44:05 But I'm sure people who can't afford to feed their families will be hedged so heavily in crypto that it would reduce the marketcap by that much. But I could be wrong

1764 2018-05-29 19:42:46 I've dissed (some) women in the space but Brenna is upfront about intention, she's incredibly attractive; good at what she does.

1788 2018-05-29 19:39:25 I'm going to guess that OCN assumed that the price dropped because investors were selling their coins because of him.  So to keep the investors happy and try to win them back they took necessary measures.

1795 2018-05-29 19:37:45 @LizClaman no amount of crypto would put me on that mountain. I'm ok working and living a little longer. Admire those who have pushed the envelope, but healthy respect and fear of nature is also a good thing.
1796 2018-05-29 19:37:35 Yep that's what I did a few years ago, but I have more recent trades I need to access. All I want are the damn records sent to the account's email.

Pretty messed up activity from a supposedly "reputable" business.

1799 2018-05-29 19:37:19 Every day you check the market
1800 2018-05-29 19:36:58 Hahaha today is the day for $OCN! Bullish
1801 2018-05-29 19:36:47 it is working like a Lamborghini on rocket fuel.... love trinity just love it. Best wallet in the crypto space no doubt.
1802 2018-05-29 19:36:40 You are the CNN of crypto news. What a joke.
1803 2018-05-29 19:36:31 Dow dropping due to Italian instability crypto going up. Finally crypto looking good as an option to the stock bubble.
1804 2018-05-29 19:36:22 @myetherwallet what a poor support! I am afraid you are together with the pushing team stealing money from crypto holders
1805 2018-05-29 19:36:14 You really double down on your conspiracy theories, don’t you. So if I understand you correctly: either people agree with your viewpoint or people support rape and child abuse? There’s no middle ground? Everything’s black and white, right?
1806 2018-05-29 19:36:09 Just wait - soon you'll be able to place these bets using crypto on @TheZenSports! 
1807 2018-05-29 19:35:49 I think you guys think too much that's why legal guys are not I. Cryptocurrency you are good supporting scams like ripple
1808 2018-05-29 19:35:49 Currently in Istanbul, how many Turkish #crypto investors are there out there? Please say hello 
1809 2018-05-29 19:35:42 En effet. Il n'y a pas de solution parfaite.
Est-ce que ça ne serrait pas un problème de manque de prédateurs ? Par exemple pour les lapins.

1825 2018-05-29 19:32:56 Btc fees are so "low" right now because people aint fuckin using it! When the next wave of crypto zombies come through maybe it pumps again but so will the fees and the time it takes transactions to complete.. like it always does.

1828 2018-05-29 19:32:41 Why did they decide ten minute blocks were optimal? Is it because they trust a messiah, higher up on the hierarchy to pick a reasonable shelling point? What would be the optimal block time, if not for Him.?

My on-prem mining just costs me 30%. #ethereum
1831 2018-05-29 19:31:45 New users in #Crypto are uninterested in decentralization but want fast gains to cash out

Older users who hold lots of #bitcoin tend to manipulate the market to strengthen their positions in spite of the market itself

Sounds a lot like the bankers that caused the 2008 crash..

1841 2018-05-29 19:30:20 What they bundle. You don't need the greatest peripherals, as well, you don't need a "kit". They're more likely just trying to justify their markups by doing that.
1842 2018-05-29 19:30:20 I like the idea of the project, I think that the project will be  implemented in the crypto world, but a lot depends on large investors,  how much they like this project

1857 2018-05-29 19:28:41 Baby steps. I agree, but I much rather have this than nothing at all. Allot of regulations involved in opening deposits and withdrawals. Can only be good for Nano and crypto in general I think.
1858 2018-05-29 19:28:40 Looks like a childish load of shite
1859 2018-05-29 19:28:39 Well in this article you can replace crypto by stocks, options, warrant etc.. it's the same 
1860 2018-05-29 19:28:26 did a bit of research and it is good for crypto right?
1861 2018-05-29 19:28:22 Meaning crypto isn't ready for mass adoption?
1862 2018-05-29 19:28:16 PlatinCoin is a sleeping giant! 
1863 2018-05-29 19:28:07 You should check out #DNR then. Most giving crypto  community by far. @carsenjk has given away more #DNR then all these combined.

1865 2018-05-29 19:27:47 You obviously know that we all got "Crypto Twitter." And yes, you agree, it is the one true Twitter.

Well... apparently there's also a Moron Twitter - and Roseanne is the leader. Haha. 
1866 2018-05-29 19:27:39 Also, the point of calling the U.K. embassy is to make a point: we will not let Tommy's arrest be a warning to instill fear and control over freedom of speech. We will not stand idly by while watching western countries fall to an invasion of evil. Wake up!

1871 2018-05-29 19:26:25 I chickened out and set a SL of 836. That would invalidate the pattern of forming higher lows on the 1 hour.

1873 2018-05-29 19:25:48 grabbed a decent bag of $SNTR on 2nd of listing on Idex.. my plan is to sell half at 10 sat.. it all depends on upcoming news, market and if it gets listed on a decent exchange.. for me the regret of selling too early (and it then moons) is bigger than bag holding 
1874 2018-05-29 19:25:32 Lmao

1891 2018-05-29 19:22:35 We all understand that your weak argument for his arrest had to do with "contempt of the court" but the rest of us with good sense can see that the whole kangaroo court was a way to silence critics of pedophiles and rapists. Otherwise, why are most of the gang rapists still free?

1895 2018-05-29 19:21:57 You can call Premium however you want. Realistically you lose 2% when selling on this service, and also you lose 2% when buying. I use it I know it. Please compare w any major exchange when exchanging and write down a note in transaction, how much was it on coinbase for example.
1896 2018-05-29 19:21:53 And this also doesn’t rely on bitcoin’s price nor the crypto market in general, nor if OCN’s actual price gets hampered by the airdrop just as we’ve seen with other coins? Lol

1912 2018-05-29 19:17:37 You can sit here and think it's just about me or *squints* crypto fascists (?!) if you want. 
The scope is actually larger, though, and defending loaded language like "mansplaining" detracts from any point or positive progress. 

Again, whatevs. Makes you feel good, you do you.

1923 2018-05-29 19:16:00 Stable #TrueUSD equivalent of Tether, crypto which is supposed to correspond to the value of $1, grows rapidly after the debut on #Binance. This is very good news for the market and for investors concerned about the $USDT situation.
1924 2018-05-29 19:16:00 Dear crypto miner (US based), you are welcome. Submitted a letter to CBP to adjust the harmonized tariff used for miners from 8543 to 8471. If approved, it will eliminate a 2.6% duty that is currently assessed on miner brought into the US.
1925 2018-05-29 19:15:59 Centralization is a moot point  if anyone can 51% attack your coin and go back to mining something else without penalty. Asics also increase hash power significantly. Call me old fashioned, but theres no point to a crypto that's not secure.
1926 2018-05-29 19:15:48 thanks
1927 2018-05-29 19:15:45 It is the biggest partnership Crypto has ever seen, you are just too lazy or stupid to do any research to find out why. You are basing everything on what you think you know, but I'm going to leave you with that, because I'd rather the price stays low for a little longer : )

1929 2018-05-29 19:15:15 Like the news that #xvg #verge is and has been a scam perpetrated on the community. With repeated pumps and dumps (remember wraith countdown??). Do whatever you want , but it stands with #bitconnect as one of greatest scams in crypto history. That news?

1940 2018-05-29 19:13:19 What scares me most of #crypto is that the price can crazily go up or down with a simple tweet. Basically, price is driven by #twitter. How crazy that is!!!

1966 2018-05-29 19:09:12 I think is no coincidence that on the month that wall st is deciding to go all in on crypto, we have a so much FUD. They have to set themselves up and you know those boys don't play unless they know they are going to win. That's my 2 cents.
1967 2018-05-29 19:08:42 Em, Kucoin is ok. If you have enough funds to get listed, it would be perfect.
1968 2018-05-29 19:08:33 While this is true, there are those very rare historical moments like Soros' Black Wednesday play in Sept 1992 when going all in is probably the most optimal strategy - with a known, small downside and potentially infinite upside (~convexity).

Normally $7.600-7.700 short term.

Also way more confidence that we'll break upwards to $8.500 beginning of June.

And might see an amazing 2nd half of the year.

2013 2018-05-29 19:02:14 Valuation is something everybody has to figure out himself. Other than stocks, crypto has no metrics at all to make a fair calculation.

2035 2018-05-29 18:59:53 There are more people in jail in the US than in all other countries combined… or something like that.

The US also spends more on "defense" than all other countries combined, we are told.

There must be some wisdom to be extracted from those statistics.

2040 2018-05-29 18:59:18 Contrary to popular belief we are not in a bear market. Let me correct people. This is a correction. This is still a bull market. Everything in crypto is magnified. Bitcoin runs 16x  drops 70%. You are still up 8x. That is not a bear market. #cryptonews #crypto #altcoins
2041 2018-05-29 18:59:18 Why did the market pump? Simple what goes down goes up. That is it. You can conjure up stories or conspiracies. At the end of the day people vote with their wallets not with opinions. #cryptonews #crypto #altcoins

2052 2018-05-29 18:56:23 Imo the Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, etc will bring volume unlike anything we’ve seen. I also think most old school whales are sitting on the sideline until Sec and Cftc can give some concrete law to crypto. Still very much the Wild West and billionaires don’t bet on the WW.

2062 2018-05-29 18:54:55 you try to get that transparency then. I am almost done trying. And a lot of people with me.

2065 2018-05-29 18:54:20 Agree with you! I'm looking for further drop. My guess is that we can see 1k $BTC this year. Good question is what is going to happen with alts. Is it possible to see ETH around $10, Stellar below $0.01 etc. Most of #crypto must die during this bear but what is left, gonna rally.
2066 2018-05-29 18:54:19 Also the inflated prices and limited availability of GPUs due to crypto mining make this a pretty crappy time to be upgrading. I'm happy with my gtx 1060/6GB for now although I'm noticing it struggle at 1440p. The setup looks great BTW, I'd love a multi monitor system.

2098 2018-05-29 18:48:01 Research has been done. Still comes to the same outcome. Bitcoin is BTC, Bitcoin Cash is BCH and Bitcoin Core is BTCC. BCH is centralized and hardly used. DOGE has more transactions and users than BCH. Maybe you should do some research. How long have you been in crypto again? Lol
2099 2018-05-29 18:47:35 Depends on btc price action, volume, and overall market sentiment. No easy one fit all strategy in crypto. Can’t wait for institutional money to enter and most coins to burn so we can evolve already.

“Blockchain” is a record-keeping method. An immutable ledger. Crypto currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) use this to record transactions, but the method itself is not the money.

2170 2018-05-29 18:38:34 Actually there is one valid core use of crypto. Provides a useful tool for laundering the proceeds of illegal activities. I would bet that a large percentage of transactions are for that purpose. The rest is just pump and greed fleecing fools. Eventually governments will act.

2174 2018-05-29 18:38:13 appreciate it, you're the man @TheRealBHuggins for going out into the community and bringing real world adoption to the crypto space! That takes courage. 
2175 2018-05-29 18:37:50 In the same vein, rebranding in $crypto seems to be a pretty stupid way to create excitement about your weak-ass project for a price pump! #crypto

2179 2018-05-29 18:37:21 It not only discredits yourself, but the whole crypto community. It’s embarrassing. It’s not the way to get more people investing in crypto.
2180 2018-05-29 18:36:55 If the @IMFNews are going to introduce their own one world currency, will it be in the form of distributed ledgers? And, if so, how does this fit in with crypto currencies that are already in fruition?
2181 2018-05-29 18:36:54 Well I guess we'll never know 
2182 2018-05-29 18:36:50 This is actually the perfect time to enter #Crypto: If you #DYOR, find a #Cryptocurrency you believe in (or better: a few -> diversify) the current Bear will let you find out whether you have what it takes to be in #Crypto. If you weather this dip, you'll weather the next.

2189 2018-05-29 18:36:04 Thanks I’m glad you enjoyed it! My idea was that I’d prefer spare CPU cycles to be used for expanding web access rather than mining crypto currencies 
2190 2018-05-29 18:35:32 That's because what takes years in those markets takes takes months to happen in crypto. As the market matures and volatility becomes more stable and predictable, the learning curve won't be so high.

2192 2018-05-29 18:34:54 Just saw a Vox video from last week about people buying crypto-collectibles and trying to figure out if “digital goods can be rare?” As if a whole part of twitter hasn’t been dropping real money on fancy .png images of their waifus for years now

2281 2018-05-29 18:20:07 would enjoy seeing a crypto chart that listed in order the coins that have retained the most value for this year. a lot of metrics is looking at gains, but not losses. if we’re talking about store of value, we should want to know loss ratio too.
2282 2018-05-29 18:19:56 How will it compare with tzero and securitize?  Can they offer something the public can invest in.   $250K is a lot for min investment levels.

2286 2018-05-29 18:19:20 @SteveandPauline like analysis Steve - looks to me like price falls since 20k are leveling out and then can move upwards. But are along way from the next halving in 2020 which normally drives prices! Also YouTube Crypto Sniper is predicting 2k! So is your analysis for short term?

Now that Crypto tanked to less than half of it’s “value” you should consider bringing down commissions specially with Bitcoin which back then was at 1%! #CryptoBanksters

2467 2018-05-29 17:58:38 Absolutely, and that's just in relation to people with a general clue about crypto. The general public will likely never be convinced.
2468 2018-05-29 17:58:23 I think that part of the problem is that most problems solved in traditional tech over the last ten years have been consumer facing systems built way up the stack, ie on app stores. With crypto everything has been shifted back down several layers so it’s all hard problems.
2469 2018-05-29 17:58:19 I'm thinking about doing my own podcast. I'd publish the videos to a website to help people with crypto. If you would be interested in being a guest please send me a DM. I might not respond to everyone but I'll try to find someone interesting. Would like to talk about deep stuff.

2482 2018-05-29 17:55:58 Well 6900 is accurate, if u look at the price actions. Their was to many orders on 6900 up to 7050 so it could never hit the 6900  but it bounced earlier on and you can see when it got past 7200~ ppl started to fomo thats why we are hangin at 74~ but its still bearish
2483 2018-05-29 17:55:48 Far to many people in #Crypto give ridged uninformed opinions before doing due diligence... its call tribalism, and it's one of the easiest ways to miss opportunity. Think for yourselves people.

Which #blockchain project should we promote to our audience of crypto enthusiasts for the first week of June? Vote now.

2533 2018-05-29 17:48:56 BITRUST is the central point, the Company, which will allow you to keep your assets in a volatile market! in which the insurer meets with a trader who wants to insure a certain crypto-currency position.

2534 2018-05-29 17:48:32 Check out this interesting project: @GRE_RISK Don't miss this interesting idea as crypto investor!   #ICO
2535 2018-05-29 17:48:31 Yea, that's an enlightened attitude to people that you disagree with.  I suppose you have pitchforks and torches as well.
2536 2018-05-29 17:48:31 @officialmcafee Experienced crypto developers been driving you crazy to get into a coin? We need someone to join a small team that wants the project moving faster.
Experience in C++; Blockchain wallets; game dev would be optimal!

2554 2018-05-29 17:44:54 Look at the great Alt run we had in April and then crash in May. In hindsight it was clear this was going to happen. It's okay to lose money as long as you learn from it and next time don't let it happen again. It's only something to worry about if you let it happen twice
2555 2018-05-29 17:44:45 Nothing about the trend suggestion going straight down from here. Maybe a retest of upper trend line around 8k-ish and if that fails then maybe we break under the higher low trend line but doubtful. Could still see a touch of high 6k’s (which I think would be nice but )
2556 2018-05-29 17:44:38 word, in crypto for only a year now, trying to learn and it's kind of irritating, that people are hated for having a different perspective. for me there is no difference in a bearish or bullish chart if the creator tried to be as objective as possible. there is no absolute truth.

2561 2018-05-29 17:44:02 What you mean is that people will pay with crypto currency online. That still makes you pay for the content. It is not "free".  Actually using the word "free" here is very wrong. You pay with your information.

2590 2018-05-29 17:40:13 Обзор Crypto Expo Moscow & Russian Blockchain Week 2018

Середина мая оказалась богата на события в криптоиндустрии. 19 и 20 мая состоялся WBC Summit, организованный Ассоциацией IDACB, о чем мы сделали отдельный репортаж — ссылка на обзор в описании этого видео.    Ну а уже на...
2591 2018-05-29 17:39:58 That chart is nah.
2592 2018-05-29 17:39:36 I totally understand what you’re implying here, but the moral is rather than asking (forcing) people to stay pessimistic about the situation, it is fundamentally imp that we talk about the solutions! If a girl has come up with such strong confession by putting her dignity 1/2
2593 2018-05-29 17:39:35 That’s a fair assessment and I could see that plan playing out. So you’re saying once #bitcoin (or #crypto) has taken over as the standard, he enacts his plan when the community either:
A. Won’t notice
B. Doesn’t care
C. It won’t create any significant change to the fundamentals

Take bill Wilson of AA for example. He never wanted to be the leader, he just wanted to be a part of the collective whole.

Having a leader means people look to him for answers as opposed to the tech/org speaking for itself

2688 2018-05-29 17:25:50 I think understanding why people buy crypto-kitties, EOS, potcoin, etc, are far more interesting. I've talked to several people, and it doesn't appear to be solely for financial gains. The behavior of miners seems fairly straightforward, unless there is some incite I've missed.

2913 2018-05-29 16:55:35 @johannamaska at the #BlockShowEurope2018 on #g20 regulations: "Usually what happens at the actual meeting is pretty scripted." Talks have been going on long before and she expects the general stances to permeate over the weeks leading up to the event.
2914 2018-05-29 16:55:31 Right now the crypto world is full of spoiled brats (looking at you @rogerkver) who are riding the wave of easy money that is so eager to fund shitcoins (to "get rich quick"). #Bitcoin's pragmatism and conservatism will guarantee its superiority when the global economy stalls.

2919 2018-05-29 16:54:52 For real? Did u get all the coins or are they being released as ur referrals provide their ids as well?
2920 2018-05-29 16:54:52 What’s New in Crypto:

2925 2018-05-29 16:54:29 That is more because of the total market size. Total market cap all of crypto right now is less than Facebook.

Qurrex is setting the industry standard in the crypto-economy for a universal cryptocurrency exchange – one which existing platforms will eventually achieve only after years of independent effort.
2936 2018-05-29 16:52:48 Awesome!  I am glad to hear this!  This just goes to show what happens if you don't have 100% control your money.  Crypto exchanges are now no better than a bank and by using them you lose all financial control.  This is not what crypto was supposed to be.
2937 2018-05-29 16:52:41 Higher hashrates, more stability.  Easy algo switching.   Can be managed from any webpage/phone.  Video to setup is pretty self explanatory.    Have fun.
2938 2018-05-29 16:52:38 Bittrex just listed $ocn faster than Binance. Bittrex has more free time that's why, once Binance adds it we will have even more liquidity. #crypto

2940 2018-05-29 16:52:07 Not giving them ID, because the ref bonuses rely on them also being able to convince your referrals to do the same. Unlikely.

2945 2018-05-29 16:51:50 A16z spamming ETH into obsolescence is quite the ambitious conspiracy theory & there are more direct ways to do it.

The simple explanation is: future crypto kitty style trans. will occur on side chains or on lower value networks. Higher value trans. will occur on main chain.

2949 2018-05-29 16:51:08 My bad, didn't realize there is a Bitcoin Core crypto now. But how can it have "fees fall to their lowest in years" when it only exists for one day? Again - be careful with those bath salts!

3166 2018-05-29 16:26:58 I actually followed all when I was new on crypto. I came to crypto precisely 80 days back. Since then I have realized I am pretty much okay with or without them. So I am not really concerned but was curious to know what made them block me.
3167 2018-05-29 16:26:43 yes sir I actually have a interview with two of their founders on my channel in interview section aswell... where they hinted at these projects and talked about the future of $LINDA  2 or 3 weeks ago :)

3171 2018-05-29 16:25:59 Moreover buying BTC will almost always be done exclusively over LN. And users wishing to hold their private keys will group together so that 10 or 100 channels can be opened in 1 blockchain transaction. So your math is wrong.

3272 2018-05-29 16:12:59 No dude that's incorrect. Not everyone will want to hold their private keys. So these users, perhaps 90% of all users, will use centralized services built on top of LN. And they won't be touching the blockchain at all. Never.

3276 2018-05-29 16:12:34 This has to be a planned scheme.  No business or reasonable person would simple confiscate people money with no advance notice or notification.

3322 2018-05-29 16:07:34 No, it is not ‘owns by the bankers’ no more than bitcoin is ‘owned by the bankers’. There is no way to ‘print more’. There was a fixed amount in the genesis ledger and no code or facility to increase that amount.
3323 2018-05-29 16:07:30 @EOS_io @EthereumNetw with the release of EOS very soon there maybe a dump of 1.2 million ETH. This could throw crypto upside down. Be prepared to get very cheap ETH around the 2/3rd June

3389 2018-05-29 15:59:06 While it is cool to have a crypto library in #rustlang, it contains a lot of platform-specific assembly code, and therefore doesn't compile for WebAssembly.

On the other side, OpenSSL does compile for WebAssembly.

The pragmatic approach remains to use the latter.

3402 2018-05-29 15:56:30 Something kind of strange.. so all across crypto twitter everyone was losing followers like mad.. and now.. everyone is gaining followers again.. at the same time. It looks like twitter is probably astroturfing and working with someone to manipulate market sentiment.. hmm
3403 2018-05-29 15:56:22 More and more it seems, #cryptocurrency in general seems NOT to be the #RiskAversion platform many thought would steal #Gold thunder...DJI down 350+, Gold Up about $5, $6 bucks, Crypto down at the moment, under EU, Italy strains today
3404 2018-05-29 15:56:04 This is where we're heading. It makes crypto usable, which means you no longer can profit by wasting electricity on dumb cycles (with crypto puzzles you can show work for time used, time is your currency, the only objective measure of value in the universe).

3462 2018-05-29 15:48:53 All three of those functions are irreplaceable and will take place whether crypto exists or doesn't. Also most "cash" transactions are electronic and bypass those issues.

3539 2018-05-29 15:40:36 All ERC20s are death traps right now. The day the SEC/CFTC deals with crypto ETH will be classified a security and these casino tokens will fall from the sky. 

Right now BTC/BCH are only values in the market imo. I do have my eyes on a few alts but I don't want to pump them yet.

3582 2018-05-29 15:35:30 Honestly, I don't know that crypto as a whole could sustain two crashes of 80%+ in 5 years and be taken seriously afterwards. I used to think going to 3K would bring in the people from retail that "missed the boat", but I don't know that would happen at this point.
3583 2018-05-29 15:35:20 That is sad and could/should be avoided giving crypto a bad name this way
3584 2018-05-29 15:35:20 Talking with @RJNance from @CityBlockCap today on security tokens for a video on the channel. Plan on a Security Token 101 type of conversation, but any questions you're really interested in hearing about?
3585 2018-05-29 15:35:18 Suggest project #RetailGlobalNow.  I am sure that the company will take its niche in the crypto-currency world! The very ambitious project, in which everything is designed to the smallest detail. #RetailGlobalNow
3586 2018-05-29 15:35:06 Thanks for the reply, What I mean to ask is can I mine crypto, and then trade it.  Whether it be in the Crypto market or the Stock market?  Thanks in advance!
3587 2018-05-29 15:35:06 My problem is that you have a following and bash a coin like $DGB when it is actually proving crypto can be used in the real-world without the technical issues you see on other blockchains: Ethereum, EOS, Verge, etc. The $DGB community doesn't bash $BTC. Without BTC, DGB is nada.

3654 2018-05-29 15:26:05 I mean no offense at all by this- I think it’s a delusion that only top 10 coins are good/will stick around/only worth investing -many great projects that will stick around- if crypto succeeds-they’ll succeed too-I personally like diversifying and sticking to top 10 is opposite

3666 2018-05-29 15:24:47 well... Nicehash is a problem when we talk about security for so many reasons and including this problem. Fact is it does make 51% easy. However, the numbers they are pulling are incorrect.

3671 2018-05-29 15:24:03 When crypto goes down:

- You can buy more Bitcoin
- Your uncle doesn't ask if he should buy
- MBAs, suits & ties, Deloitte blockchain experts exit the market
- It's ok and spend some crypto, esp. on weird use cases (collectibles to me)
- Much less noise in general
3672 2018-05-29 15:24:01 $EOS sure seems like a lot of empty promises.

3677 2018-05-29 15:23:16 Cryptos. There is no evidence whales have been shorting crypto markets. The weakness in May appears to have come from liquidation of longs by small spec retail traders.
3678 2018-05-29 15:23:05 Cool story. When I was young, I so wanted Nessie to be a plesiosaur. As a dino loving kid, I just found them to be fascinating. I was kind of bummed when I was 12 and read that plesiosaurs breathed air. The crypto people who push that Nessie theory kind of ignore that part.

3718 2018-05-29 15:19:21 It has nothing to do with what games are fun or not. The Ethereum blockchain can’t continue to support this behavior and remain decentralized.

3920 2018-05-29 14:58:17 Crypto is becoming more like political arena. Haters just gonna hate more. Cant they just talk about their own coin than attacking others. Example: I have respect to digibyte previously but now no coz recently they keep attacking any coins they can especially Verge.

3923 2018-05-29 14:57:41 Scepticism is healthy I completely agree with you. I'm sceptical myself and frankly nervous if this support breaks. The only thing we can do is let this one play out.
3924 2018-05-29 14:57:30 As the global fiat system falls and is dismantled, the flight to Cryptos  will be amazing! The globe is recognizing the freedom that Cryptos provide. As the old system clamps down on freedom, we as the crypto community must receive the fiat refugees with open arms! #freedom
3925 2018-05-29 14:57:23 Nah. I'd rather speak out against the pedophile takeover of ur gov, shutdown of free speech, & rape gangs you turn away from. Unlike you, we care about the freedom and well-being of citizens and innocent pp and speak up for those who can't speak. But keep your head in the sand.

3927 2018-05-29 14:57:14 I saw a VC commenting on the speed at which crypto is advancing based on "watching GitHub" ...if only they knew most of those commits were just "adding feature" "rolling back feature cause it broke and is dumb" "ok not dumb, fixed the thing and adding back feature"
3928 2018-05-29 14:57:07 I’m just creeping around hahah

3932 2018-05-29 14:56:33 crypto nary what do you think about dent coin? 300K active users app with 1M target for end of june and marketplace is coming!! a product that doesn't do any form of hype and has a working product! please share your opinion
thanks you're the best!!
3933 2018-05-29 14:56:26 Is there still meant to be a 1% fee going from fiat to crypto?
3934 2018-05-29 14:56:11 Crypko、いつのまにか10万枚突破してる・・・勢いすごいな
3935 2018-05-29 14:56:09 Sure. What else should normal, inexperienced investors do? If i has bought BTC on 20k i also would wait, but also buy in till it goes back to 20k ore higher.
3936 2018-05-29 14:56:07 Read the numbers.. 

30 $OCP for EACH $OCN

That’s not accurate. And who chimed you in any how?

3963 2018-05-29 14:52:46 I agree conceptually. Though most of the people I know that bought crypto close to the top still holds, they just decided to forget about their bad investment and let it sit.

4014 2018-05-29 14:45:50 User's inability to understand how a seed works falls under "be your own bank," and was perfectly fine when BTC didn't have seed generators (a P2P coin). Now when developers can't even figure out how to code eth to not lose 100s of millions of dollars, that's a significant flaw.

4197 2018-05-29 14:24:53 yea I am a fallen victim of the high withdrawal fees, im an optimist and love free $$ so if you see it through this way and potential of $1 floor of $DIG the opportunity weighs more than a high withdrawal fee.
