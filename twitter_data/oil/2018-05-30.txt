2 2018-05-30 23:59:07 Great now your fellow con artists can sell their snake oil to everyone stupid enough to buy it. They can start by calling your Trump University students and people who invested in your Atlantic City & work their way through everyone that voted for you.

4 2018-05-30 23:59:04 Yep!! we bought all kinds of stuff candies oil they had alllll kinds of stuff
5 2018-05-30 23:59:03 I bought some CBD oil. I’m that kind of person now. Last month I bought anti-anxiety pills from India. This month it’s CBD oil from a health food store. I’m outta control!

7 2018-05-30 23:58:41 Might be oil under all the ice 
8 2018-05-30 23:58:40 Executive hm ? I think China owns more Canadian oil than we do . That actually should upset you.
9 2018-05-30 23:58:36 It's already been tried. And even a super majority of democrats in 2009 didn't renew the Clinton era ban. Columbine occurred during the ban with a banned gun. Many studies showed the ban had little effect on gun crime, or the murder rate.
10 2018-05-30 23:58:33 Another mistake Hitler made was splitting his forces to go capture oil fields.
11 2018-05-30 23:58:28 That's a great idea! My husband has a long goatee that he braids then uses those tiny rubber bands to secure while on his motorcycle. He could use the extra conditioning, on top of the beard oil I bought him. Thanks!
12 2018-05-30 23:58:27 Too bad for he caved in to Big Oil. 
13 2018-05-30 23:58:21 Trump just signed the ‘right to try’ act! That’s exactly what cured me! Medical cannabinoid oil!  God is so good and always on time, talk to your healthcare team ASAP!
14 2018-05-30 23:58:20 I was referring to @Crypto4thepeeps Sean Davis when I said he was the same as us. We are watching his cryto journey its up to you whether you follow suit. He's a good dude and he just wants to help people. Total opposite of that snake oil sales man, stollarie. #crypto4dapeople
15 2018-05-30 23:58:17 I don’t know if everyone already knows this, but coconut oil has done wonders for my skin, 10/10 would recommend

17 2018-05-30 23:58:08 Medical marijuana is the way to go! CBD oil.  You can get a Rx online for under $100 for a year.  Relief for a month for about the same.
18 2018-05-30 23:58:04 Do you have a plan to reduce lighting deaths?

38 2018-05-30 23:57:59 India & Iran drop dollar in oil trade to bypass US sanctions – says Russia news channel
39 2018-05-30 23:57:46 I wanted to get away for the holiday weekend but WTH gas prices ended that thought. Trump is simply marinated in crude oil like so many others.
40 2018-05-30 23:57:43 Sounds like  maybe you should turn yours in, just sayin'. Threats on a public forum aren't received well, but I figured you were disingenuous from the beginning with your name calling.
41 2018-05-30 23:57:40 Just need to get oil pan to fit and in she goes
42 2018-05-30 23:57:33 Moomin นำโชค
43 2018-05-30 23:57:10 The guy at autozone is like do u know what kind of oil you use... like i barely know how to turn the car on boy
44 2018-05-30 23:56:54 I don’t believe we’ll see a return on investment before 2020 when clean energy is expected to be cheaper than oil.
45 2018-05-30 23:56:51 I hear they want to package the oil in something called tide-pods..
46 2018-05-30 23:56:45 if u look up noncomedogenic oils there's a rating system with 0 being the least likely to clog pores. coconut oil is a four out of five lmao

48 2018-05-30 23:56:32 If the risk/reward was just on their territory then of course we would have no say. But oil necessarily travels through places that they do not own.  So that is the difference.
49 2018-05-30 23:56:25 Lol. My wife was just getting after me for only using dark tanning oil. SPF 0
50 2018-05-30 23:56:24 It truly is a shame that the government had to step in. However, pipeline capacity is needed to improve the financial viability of our oil industry which funds many social programs on an ongoing basis and provides well paid jobs for blue-collar workers.
51 2018-05-30 23:56:10 I cam spot a tea tree oil shampoo guy a mile away!
52 2018-05-30 23:56:04 awesome to see you get what you deserve. good karma for good people

54 2018-05-30 23:55:38 Hey angry folks get off my twitter! We have no replacement for oil yet and need to do better with the environment can we agree on that before i block  you all.
55 2018-05-30 23:55:34 So our prime minister is now an oil baron. Nice bailout, bro. What's the over/under on how long it'll be before the world as we know it becomes #intothebadlands?
56 2018-05-30 23:55:31 Cut in half lightly fry, drizzle with oil and balsamic and finish in 350 oven for 30 mins, then dust with parmigiana
57 2018-05-30 23:55:30 I super suggest pear balsamic vinegar, olive oil, grain dijon mustard, spicy brown mustard, and some cracked pepper for a dressing
I wish I made more of it tbh
58 2018-05-30 23:55:28 How is @gmbutts going to phase out oil by 2050, with another pipeline to pay for?! 
59 2018-05-30 23:55:10 Correction, it is seven old guys in Brooklyn's will -- correction Warwick. BTW have you heard that they bought that huge piece of land upstate because it was "cheap on the market" because of the contamination of old oil, chemicals, etc. which could be harmful to health ??

62 2018-05-30 23:54:58 I can tell who doesn’t have a luxury car.. y’all don’t know how much a damn oil change is on a Benz.. Rang.. BMW.. Audi etc.. you don’t take those cars to Jiffy Lube 
63 2018-05-30 23:54:57 What does your research tell you about the emissions levels of pipelines vs tanker trucks? Safety and spill comparisons? Or do you just think Canada can eliminate oil usage completely over night?
64 2018-05-30 23:54:55 I just vitamin e oil it helps but still dryer than the Sahara desert
65 2018-05-30 23:54:39 A guinea piggy? My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment… During this meet-up I already got it, but thanks.

   my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.

68 2018-05-30 23:54:27 
69 2018-05-30 23:54:25 That is my instinct too but they really have a lot of oil...
70 2018-05-30 23:54:19 Is olive oil bad? I use that and don’t break out 
71 2018-05-30 23:54:18 What I want is to move away from oil and for us to focus on clean energy. Oil isn’t the future.
72 2018-05-30 23:54:12 Cooking (braising) tempeh in some sort of stock+oil/butter for awhile is really good and simple and probably bad for you.
73 2018-05-30 23:54:07 This BBL matter once fully approved will surely bring our country in the books where the circling and incumbent oil crisis wil no longer be observed.
74 2018-05-30 23:53:57 Agreed completely. What do you think about $NOG or northern oil & gas??
75 2018-05-30 23:53:46 Tea tree oil
76 2018-05-30 23:53:44 Umm “... the IPA, Vietnam and Iraqi wars both based on a lies AWB oil for wheat, kids overboard lie, work choices, rorting on a unprecedented scale, politicisation of the AFP, FWC, ABC, AEC, ATO, ASIS, ASIO, the mad monk  duttplug out of characters bugger!
77 2018-05-30 23:53:17 I need some oil so I can finally use this deep fryer. I’ve had it almost an entire year.
78 2018-05-30 23:53:03 And to whom are you speaking?
79 2018-05-30 23:53:01 Dr Anas Alhajji is the one I despise the most in #OOTT. He HATES it when someone points out how wrong he is. Back in 2016 he was writing how OPEC was dead and how great shale would be (he was wrong). Since last fall, he has been trying to discredit US oil production and the EIA.
80 2018-05-30 23:52:56 Sooo I just made quinoa myself for the first time, I used olive oil, lemon juice and chicken broth in it and yummmmm 
81 2018-05-30 23:52:31 Not for money. Not for oil!
82 2018-05-30 23:52:17 Order 1500 cbd oil on internet. Legal in all 50 states. Approx 90.00 per bottle. Should last 25 days. I know other cancer patients it is helping. There is no high in it.
83 2018-05-30 23:51:37 Trump grifters are all about selling snake oil. These lying duplitious GOP dirtbags will toss oversight and regs overboard so that Trump branded "Turbo Cancer Cure-All" can compete with valid alternative treatments. Selling false hope is another Trump trademark.
84 2018-05-30 23:51:35 How well was KM operating the pipeline?  Was Parkland getting the supplies of oil needed, or was export given priority?  Was maintenance carried out?  Were there problems with regulatory bodies - inspections, workbc, cra, etc?  Did journalists investigate?
85 2018-05-30 23:51:34 このコピペ懐かしいな
86 2018-05-30 23:51:30 You have time to make this personal, do you time to meet somewhere? You seem to be a person of strong conviction, let’s meet and you can tell me I’m a oathbreaker to my face. I’m in Colorado next week if it’s closer to you. You ever in Tempe, az?
87 2018-05-30 23:51:27 1) The Louisiana Offshore Oil Platform can now load 2 million bbl VLCC ships, 4X the size that can load at Westridge
88 2018-05-30 23:51:21 Very low interest rates.  
First time interest rates rising
Energy market started to move
Alberta and oil market looking better.  You are not richer than you think!   

Things are slowing down 

Trump cannot make America young again
89 2018-05-30 23:51:09 I got a haircut and a oil change today after sitting in my house for 3 days straight. 

So you could say I feel very accomplished... it’s the little things.
90 2018-05-30 23:51:09 I need a little friend..Somebody to oil my scalp would be so helpful right now
91 2018-05-30 23:50:56 1000% agree...worst is ahead of Canadian. @bankofcanada action even at high oil prices , proves it
92 2018-05-30 23:50:54 Go away Cadiz. This reminds me of the oil company commercials that try to get all warm and fuzzy.
93 2018-05-30 23:50:52 It'll move some Liberal votes to the NDP in BC, but it'll keep pipeline and oil companies donating to the LPC. The Liberals fortunes are in Ontario and Quebec anyway, any seats west of Winnipeg is gravy.
94 2018-05-30 23:50:39 Trump told her to bring the baby oil. 
95 2018-05-30 23:50:17 Steelo and baking soda/salt. Scrub, rinse well. Wipe w a few drips of food oil. Heat a tiny bit to + repeat with oil... I bought tube of restorer from Mitre 10 but doesn’t work well.
96 2018-05-30 23:50:14 Listen to @cbcasithappens to hear what First Nations representatives of communities through which the pipeline will travel are saying about it.  If we are making public investment in energy it should go into R&D for zero-waste renewables, not more subsidy to oil.
97 2018-05-30 23:49:36 WAIT I need an oil change too HahahHa can we go together
98 2018-05-30 23:49:30 y’all i did adulting things like an oiL CHANGE
99 2018-05-30 23:49:23 What you wanted him to do? Buy him a AMG Benz so he cant afford Preminum gas & a oil change??? He was WALKING! U gotta understand, what if he worked at fastfood? A blessing is a blessing.. stop counting the amount

103 2018-05-30 23:48:56 BETTER than rose hip?  I actually already have both in my cabinet because I'm an oil hoarder and I like grapeseed oil as a heat protectant.  I currently use rose hip on my face though. Might have to blend the two...

107 2018-05-30 23:48:41 Need that scalp massaged with coconut oil?  I've been told I have magical hand.
108 2018-05-30 23:48:38 finally registered my car and got maine plates, got my oil changed, new windshield wipers, and now i get to pick my classes for school! Today has been super productive and i’ll be in ct in one week!
109 2018-05-30 23:48:32  #CA23 Don’t U want someone who cares about ur children more than #NRABloodMoney & his A+ rating from NRA, #KevinMcCarthy denies climate change is Anti Choice & Anti #LGBTQ &wants to sell out our Oceans/Marine Life to Oil Co’s! #Bakersfield Let @Matta4Congress keep CA safe!
110 2018-05-30 23:48:23 怒られそうだけど「瞳の奥まで見えてるからな」はちょっと笑った
111 2018-05-30 23:48:05 I don’t know shit about cars so I asked my dad ahead of time what I needed for the oil
112 2018-05-30 23:48:02 of course it would . And it is a bad leonard . I mean guys , if a Warhol goes for over 100 millions, what did you expect for a real master . There a no Leonard oil painting for sale. He painted very few, and the master piece are in main Museum and will never be on the market
113 2018-05-30 23:47:47 Portraits...

Get yours done?!
114 2018-05-30 23:47:39 Funny not that long ago you sported a anti oil sweatshirt? With Minister Phillips. If you spend our$ gotta sell our resources
115 2018-05-30 23:47:31 I’ve never tried or even used to body lava but they’re both highlighters/illuminates so I figure they do the same thing! Idk about body lava but this is oil based w glitter so it’s not like a cream or gel as far as texture
116 2018-05-30 23:47:24 Oil changes and routine maintenance on a Lamborghini are about $700. I can only imagine a Ferrari is similar.

118 2018-05-30 23:47:22 You may not like what I do with Tofu, olive oil and a bit of parsley in the food processor then— vegan ricotta!
119 2018-05-30 23:47:17 .@ChuckGrassley - @EPAScottPruitt @scottpruittok doesn't care about your iowans. He and the @gop are all about big oil and gas $$
120 2018-05-30 23:47:15 bleach/bleach bath, a bleach bath is still bleaching your hair but just not as strong, bleach it at most twice and wait a day in between bleaching it if you’re hair is already damaged use coconut oil and other hair treatments!!!
121 2018-05-30 23:47:11 I've got some snake oil for sale to your terminally ill patient.
122 2018-05-30 23:47:09 I heard CBD oil works wonders. God bless.
123 2018-05-30 23:46:57 Right..... plus, you can ride a Nissan till the wheels fall off.  Just change the oil! Lol
124 2018-05-30 23:46:55 I have had guacamole with cottage cheese in it (NO) and with for some reason olive oil (also NO).
125 2018-05-30 23:46:51 You know else kind of gave me a sort of chuckle? Miss All Natural had weight reduction surgery. I guess snake oil doesn't cure that?
126 2018-05-30 23:46:50 when ur "szechuan" chicken is swimming in chili oil that has absolute 0 heat to it and all it does is leave u w baaad indigestion lol 8))))
127 2018-05-30 23:46:42 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
128 2018-05-30 23:46:34 Oil is Cape Three Points... Takoradi only houses offices and workshops; but the main resource is in Cape Three Points.
129 2018-05-30 23:46:33 *embalms self with mint oil*
130 2018-05-30 23:46:23 Actually that is incorrect and what the media wants you to believe.  You are being mislead.
131 2018-05-30 23:46:19 I have some concerns with this opening up to snake oil sales. Hoping there are protections.
132 2018-05-30 23:46:16 Cara acredita em amigo imaginário depois de adulto e vem falar bosta,  típico cidadão de bem kkkkk
Alienado total é aquele que não sabe que o dinheiro do mundo em ele bancar amigo imaginário e o oil americano
133 2018-05-30 23:46:06 Thinking of doing an oil giveaway? Hmmmm...
134 2018-05-30 23:45:52 As a drop of soap , dropped in-between people / oil molecules , and everything happens as you thought .
135 2018-05-30 23:45:49 Love this face wash!! Plus it takes off all my make up and a bottle lasts 
 about 2 months!
#DidYouKnow Coconut oil is known to be an incredible moisturizer? Naturally, Nerium made sure to include coconut-derived surfactants in our Double-Cleansing Face Wash!
136 2018-05-30 23:45:36 How can people be so unconcerned with eating oil slick meat? Orion is WEIRDNESS. Also Pangea is now the forth supercontinent!! The ancient past is reemerging and becoming the present! there are 3 supercontinents that predate pangea and a multitude of ancient structures appearing

141 2018-05-30 23:45:06 It really ought to say 'shysters & snake oil sellers'
142 2018-05-30 23:45:00 It's all spreadsheets  which don't really play out in reality as such. As far as seen, the state of the country at the point of the oil crash meant there was no way the recession wasn't going to hit. 
Hindsight is always 20/20 but blaming this govt for the recession is myopic
143 2018-05-30 23:44:55 Agreed!  Now all we need to do is get the friggen gasoline prices down to an acceptable level.  This eats up a lot of the profit we are receiving from increased wages!  Our oil reserves are huge.  Do something about these prices at the pump!  Thank you.
144 2018-05-30 23:44:54 yeah. “Let’s have a conversation”. and in the mean time, here’s a paid actor who never stops spewing oil and gas industry dogma while making sweat stains on an ikea couch 
145 2018-05-30 23:44:44 All deaths matter to me, but again how is disarming me going to save toddlers?  And again, how about the toddlers whose parents used a gun to save their lives? I guess that doesn't count.
146 2018-05-30 23:44:38 CBD oil can be purchased at most health food stores now, for reasonable prices- $100 compared to $750. It’s a great healer for many conditions. Wishing your father well.
147 2018-05-30 23:44:35 People make no sense putting Offset down for buying a used Altima. First of all, you have to maintain oil changes, gas, insurance, etc. It doesn’t make sense to buy a guy who was walking to work a brand new car that will hit him hard in the long run.
148 2018-05-30 23:44:33 High oil price.. simples. Although your assertion is incorrect... Jona left it at over N210 in 2015.

158 2018-05-30 23:43:38 Well, what are YOU doing about climate change? 
...or are you still using oil/coal-based transportation, plastics, electricity, etc? 
Amazes me how Climate Advocates do so little themselves for the cause they're so passionate about. Heck, I do more.

162 2018-05-30 23:43:23 You ever solved a complex problem? Pareto charting? Sure you have. If we look at health issue of “Americans dying by gun” Toddler deaths would be on the chart. If we solved that issue, we would be working towards total goal. If anybody is serious about reducing it that is how.

169 2018-05-30 23:42:02 Very good point. And I think that’s where this will all grind to a halt again; not at world oil prices, or construction costs, but the PM’s unwillingness to anger certain groups.

173 2018-05-30 23:41:50 Interesting q. I think definitions vary; my comment is in regard to Mr. Harris's definition. Buchanan's foreign policy stance puts people first, ahead of oil, money, or hegemony, & that's the most important thing to me. I do find him obnoxious on some things. So not sure, I guess
174 2018-05-30 23:41:50 Today Lucas Oil
175 2018-05-30 23:41:43 I wonder where your obsession with oil comes from... Oil is in an uptrend as of now. And even if it breaks 66 more time is needed. XOM, HAL, etc are nowhere bearish setups. Why not short german automotives instead? They look like crap (not like oil).
176 2018-05-30 23:41:27 Will strongly consider marrying the man or woman who can figure out my oil light issue in the Jeep.

179 2018-05-30 23:41:21 That would have to have been a Democrat President. Carter never sent one soldier to a war. President Obama tried to end the TWO wars of lies, begun by Bush, Cheney for oil, that blew up the Middle East. We're still paying for their lies today.

182 2018-05-30 23:40:53 Wow.  Is this related to oil prices?  Something else?  To put a longer historical perspective on this, when I first went to Nigeria in 1991, the naira to dollar ratio was 10:1.
183 2018-05-30 23:40:43 And I have also experienced death of loved ones from cancer first hand. I’d still ask them to be wary of ‘snake oil salesmen’ types offering a last chance. The FDA exists for a purpose, it doesn’t harm people, it’s there to protect the most vulnerable.

186 2018-05-30 23:40:31 During chemo my Oncologist prescribed marinol. It’s synthetic. Was not effective for me. I use CBD oil now for stress, anxiety and sleep. I think it’s terrible that it isn’t available for compassionate care. I’m sorry you &your dad has to go through this

193 2018-05-30 23:39:31 So you are pissed our Government owns a part of a Canadian oil company, How do yo feel about communist China owning a Canadian oil company ? Don't insult my political intelligence. you are behaving like a complete rube.
194 2018-05-30 23:39:28 It’s definitely not all of us, Vancouver is on par to be the greenest city by 2020. It’s the d*cks in gov who are in bed with the large oil companies. Once we change to green energy our economy will take a dive so they are delaying it, sadly.

204 2018-05-30 23:38:04 The only way Trudeau could make Kinder Morgan worse is if he decides to pay the oil workers via the Phoenix. #trudeau
205 2018-05-30 23:37:42 The nationalizing of the project is bad I’ll agree. Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil and minimize risks. Also maybe you should do some research about the environmental standard of the Canadian industry before you call it the worlds ‘dirtiest fossil fuel source’

207 2018-05-30 23:37:16 For example at the eight weddings full of innocent people America blew up between 2001 and 2013. Or in Iran, who's democratic government America overthrew for oil. Or in Iraq, Jemen, Palestine, Syria, Afghanistan. Take your pick, lot's to choose from.
208 2018-05-30 23:36:57 Do any gun deaths matter to you? If not toddlers, who?
209 2018-05-30 23:36:38 Y’all talking wild on Offset name like ol walk to work Jmmar could afford to change tha oil in a wraith or lamb or whatever y’all think he should have gotten him lmaooo you get people what they can afford to take care of not what looks good.
210 2018-05-30 23:36:37 Don't beat yourself up! If they replaced important safety parts like brakes, or fixed oil leaks, then that's usually stuff you need. But you can usually get away with declining their upsells and taking their recs to and ind and save yourself some money on labor costs!

212 2018-05-30 23:36:20 It would seem toddler accidents are ones we can all agree on are most sensless and should be easy to agree we all need to address. Do you agree change is needed? if not, great, but nothing to debate here.
213 2018-05-30 23:36:18 In 1975, The Pierre E. Trudeau government gave  the then new crown corporation Petro Canada $1.5 BILLION to help start up. Now his son Justin, gives Transmountain $4.5 BILLION tax payer dollars. What is the matter with Trudeaus and giving taxpayer dollars to oil companies?

218 2018-05-30 23:35:25 These are American citizens why are we not enraged that our brothers and sisters are being forgotten and some without power, but rest assured if there was oil, gold, or some other precious mineral that island would be rebuilt already with a new power grid #truth

221 2018-05-30 23:34:48 Iraq said they were going to take the oil back, she said the US had no interest in the matter. Seems pretty clear that the US was encouraging the invasion so that they’d have a reason to attack Iraq.
222 2018-05-30 23:34:47 Please look at the connection between pediatric cancer and water quality.  Radioactive frackwater causes bone cancer for 5000 years.

226 2018-05-30 23:34:07 I saw a story tonight on NBC Nightly News. There is an evangelical minister from Bew Orleans( Jesse Duplantis). Who claims Jesus told him he needs a new (Dassault Falcon 7X) 54 million dollar Air Plane. He wants his followers to pay for it. This man is  snake oil salesman.
227 2018-05-30 23:34:06 Ok so let’s see. Kinder-Morgan bought the Trans Mountain in 2007 for 377 million. The Royal Bank last year valued it at 2.5 billion and yet the Liberals bought it for 4.5 billion. Those Texas Oil Barons must have been saying “Houston we have a sucker”

232 2018-05-30 23:33:39 Data says oil took us in & out of it, if you have contrary data please provide it.
2008 oil price drop caused a big hit mitigated by savings not miracle policy, but good old savings.
Point is another price drop is around the corner, how prepared are we?
233 2018-05-30 23:33:29 On soap, they used the world sodium palmatate to signify that the soap base was made with palm oil. Unfortunately, other soap bases may contain palm oil in them as well but it's not as obvious. Sodium Stearate may be made with various oils.

241 2018-05-30 23:32:20 Washington has 5 export oil terminals. Be honest. You don’t want competition. Stay out of Canada’s business.
242 2018-05-30 23:32:10 One thing I know for sure is it may as well be our oil then oil from Saudi Arabia.. there is still a demand for it and we have it. If we dont supply it someone else will while we as a country suffer financially
243 2018-05-30 23:32:06 Just wait until gas prices spike and further dampens consumer spending. A rise in oil prices leads to increases in goods & related products. Thanks to Trump dumping the Iran deal & reimposing sanctions, oil prices are likely to increase. So get ready folks #TrumpIsUnfit

248 2018-05-30 23:31:15 She.  Also - “We have no opinion in your dispute” [over border oil field and price of oil] is not the same as “We authorize you to conquer your neighbor.”
249 2018-05-30 23:31:10 The United States is now exporting 2.3 millions barrels of oil per day. They're getting top dollar. That could have been Canada earning billions upon billions of dollars were it not for the Liberals and NDP. #cdnpoli #onpoli #ableg

257 2018-05-30 23:30:19 All nations have religion, yet they don’t have the gun deaths. Insulting, and ZERO data to support your religion would fix this.

259 2018-05-30 23:30:03 Do you live near a state that has legalized marijuana? You can get your dad a year’s supply of CBD oil for far less than that. Don’t know if that’s practical, just thought I’d suggest. Hope you get some help for your father.

266 2018-05-30 23:29:28 @billmckibben this isn't news, you know Canada has been a petrostate for years. Falling oil prices brought Trudeau to power, and he needs to manage the oil economy to stay there.
267 2018-05-30 23:29:14 Go to buy oil and a filter for the bike. End up getting a headlight oh and a new tire. Because getting detoured down a dirt road ends up with a hole in the old one sad.
268 2018-05-30 23:29:13 Bhai esa kuch nahi hai. Cars are manufactured to withstand high temperature. India mein b ye viral hua tha kafi ajkal mein. Indian oil firm ne deny kar diya aisa kuch nahi hota. Most probable reasons is I've heard 8 rupe petrol and 12 rupe diesel ke price barhnay wali hai.

It is clear your process mapping into was a ruse, as you had a result already determined.
274 2018-05-30 23:28:13 Hay jim why do the saudis come out every other day and tell us what the price of oil should be. If there so concerned.why don't they double their gas prices. it's only $0.80 a gallon in Saudi Arabia.
275 2018-05-30 23:28:09 I urge everyone to support this bill -- and further, to do everything practicable to reduce the torture and beaching we make our "cousins of the oceans" endure from shipping and from certain kinds of underwater oil exploration.

281 2018-05-30 23:27:05 With you on this one JP. Responsible development of oil and gas is not high on the priority list for this type of development. Interesting how certain laws don't apply to the industry, yet we can't provide people with lead riddled water...

283 2018-05-30 23:26:55 @jimcramer Please, please!!! I beg of you and your staff.  Stop referring (usually in a headline) to HPQ as "HP".  When I see "HP" in a headline .... I think of oil drilling (Helmerich & Payne).   Often it takes a bit of reading to see if it is HP or HPQ or HPE.
284 2018-05-30 23:26:51 That should be the tagline on every box that homeopaths, and GNC and other snake oil salesmen peddle.
"We have no idea what it do, but we think it will work"
285 2018-05-30 23:26:40 I have a lot of unpopular opinions about KM Trans Mountain being an indigenous person living in AB who is really concerned about the environment of my neighbouring nations and I'm fucking sick to death of the constant rebuttal of "ya but you use oil"
286 2018-05-30 23:26:23 I started out using lemon or lime to detox my body. Ive been using tea tree/coconut oil for 6yrs now with no issues. I workout daily. (Detox)

289 2018-05-30 23:26:14 Mr. Snake Oil Salesman.
290 2018-05-30 23:25:58 Shea moisture: peppermint.. Black castor oil & leave in conditioner !!! RESTORED my hair. I recommend it, even for your curls. I usually will use it after showering, I’ll braid my hair and sleep on it. Did it for a year, now it’s so soft and gives me a natural volume 
291 2018-05-30 23:25:49 Reminder: the most powerful ppl in the world exploited 9/11 to go to war with a country for oil. This should outrage and disgust everyone.
292 2018-05-30 23:25:45 my car currently has no breaks, worthless windshield wipers, 10% oil and a headlight out...I don’t even want to know what it’s going to cost me to fix it all friday 
293 2018-05-30 23:25:40 The neocons are pure nonsense. for the price of oil.. it's funny they want to open up North Korea.. but they don't want to open up Iran
294 2018-05-30 23:25:33 @that1mum  hey love where do you usually purchase your witch hazel & black castor oil from?
295 2018-05-30 23:25:14 my uncle laughed at my chaco tan line? little does he know i intentionally sprayed tanning oil on my feet so this would happen
296 2018-05-30 23:25:03 What is he supposed to get this guy? A G Wagon so he can get 10mpg and pay $200 for an oil change?
297 2018-05-30 23:24:49 Make sure you hit the Bloods and Crips and Ms 13 first!
298 2018-05-30 23:24:36 I need some oil sheen to wrap my hair.....
299 2018-05-30 23:24:35 PUFA oils on discarded cloths also spontaneously combust... e.g.linseed oil (self-polymerising artist's varnish)
300 2018-05-30 23:24:31 Make a Pesto. Use the scapes in place of basil with olive oil in food processor. Delicious! 
301 2018-05-30 23:24:29 There not firing any rockets..neocons want higer oil.for the saudis and koch brothers..if really serious but Iran.. you never would have got out of the treaty and you would have opened up trade...i mean u want to do that with north korea.. but you won't deal with Iran
302 2018-05-30 23:24:26 Isn't CBD oil legal everywhere since it doesn't contain THC? It can be purchased online.
303 2018-05-30 23:24:19 Nah fr olive oil they was deadass LINED UP like we in elementary stop playing lmaooo
304 2018-05-30 23:24:08 You know the 2/3 rule? I did have guns in the house, and I did lose a loved one. Tell me about the 2/3 rule proud gun owner
305 2018-05-30 23:24:05 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. How does the green left justify buying #bloodoil when #LGBTQ are being killed?  @YEGPride

308 2018-05-30 23:23:57 At the end of a wikipedia rathole, I just learned that oreo cookies made and sold in canada are different than the rest of the world. Ours use coconut oil instead of hydrogenated vegetable oil in the filling.

And now you all know this too.
309 2018-05-30 23:23:36 Kailangan ko ng i change oil yung motor. Latak na langis na yung laman nung makina nun e
310 2018-05-30 23:23:36 I wonder how old they are

Would make an awesome story if you could somehow piece together a story about how they were traded for copper buttons or whale oil or something like that during colonial times.
311 2018-05-30 23:23:10 So I learned how much stockbrokers are allowed to spend in a day by watching one spend over $800 million on around 80,000 bonds from an oil company today
312 2018-05-30 23:23:02 Just momentum left Over from Obama’s term. The impacts of the Republican tax bill, oil price jump (NG too ?), developing trade wars and lack of confidence by the high producers of America (aka Clinton voters) is beginning to have an impact.
313 2018-05-30 23:22:50 I know, I am guessing that we should all get an employee discount on oil now right? Damn straight.... so frustrating.
314 2018-05-30 23:22:39 How will they cook it?  In the same oil they cook animals?
315 2018-05-30 23:22:37 It would be an honor for me to die trying to take your guns if we the people decide. By you killing me, I would feel relief that it was not a fellow American that had to prove you were actually never law abiding. 

Volunteers in the front, sheriffs in the middle and feds in back
316 2018-05-30 23:22:36 Leaving it at oil is tad too simplistic. We are not the only oil producing country in the world. And also, there have been other periods of crude oil price shocks and Nigeria didn’t fall into a recession then. Our main issue was fx scarcity and we could better managed it
317 2018-05-30 23:22:32 tried to make luna eat some skin allergy remedy oil stuff and she hated it and now the joke's on me because my hands are going to smell like extremely potent artificial chicken forever now
318 2018-05-30 23:22:22 Happy birthday bro,wish you more blessings @iamzeezaga
319 2018-05-30 23:22:20 True that is a possibility  they also have palm oil (right?) which can be considered non vegan to some
320 2018-05-30 23:22:09 It did get about 20 degrees hotter all the sudden, just you wait for the out-takes reel hosted by Lucille Ball. Or when Jim Bob Furley, the oil tycoon talks Jack's old Navy buddy out of an investment
321 2018-05-30 23:22:06 If “privatizing“ concerns u...trump should concern u. He wants to privatize r public lands, sell off r oil reserves, privatize r roads highways bridges infrastructure & wars. Wanna pay tolls & taxes to the Koch brothers or have ur taxes ensure ur future investment in ur country?
322 2018-05-30 23:22:02 when my mental state changes I get really impulsive & spend a ton of money so here I am w hardly any money till Tuesday & then I get to spend all that on rent + my Argentina payment + phone bill + oil change COOL good going madison 
323 2018-05-30 23:21:59 Folks that’s never had a luxury car don’t know what’s all involved in keeping a luxury car. That 100$ oil change comes around every other month seems like and put regular gas in that bih if you want too.
324 2018-05-30 23:21:56 2 in grains ~10 in oil & gas & ~10 in livestock
325 2018-05-30 23:21:15 Sorry... but no.
You know nothing of me.
NOTHING!
326 2018-05-30 23:20:50 Let’s just say my oil investments have been nothing but success 
327 2018-05-30 23:20:46 I did my due oil change and I only had a quart and a half of oil!! Wtf!!??
328 2018-05-30 23:20:44 Heatin' up some internet oil, gonna fry me up a couple of spciy jay-pegs

331 2018-05-30 23:20:36 I can't be long oil and airlines can I 
332 2018-05-30 23:20:36 Remember when one of the biggest vegan accounts blocked my ass cause I told her oreos are definetly not vegan because of the palm oil in them which is destroying orangutans environment lol
333 2018-05-30 23:20:31 Right now the oil goes to Washington state refineries at a $24 bbl discount and comes back to us as gasoline and they pocket the $24. Multiply that by 300000 bbls per day of discounts to US buyers.
334 2018-05-30 23:20:28 Gas is expensive af cuz Canada decided it’s only going to sell its oil to the United States and then buy it back for double lol oh and we have no refineries
335 2018-05-30 23:20:26 CBD oil works. Many of my hospice patients use them. Your father has terminal cancer. Eff the system.
336 2018-05-30 23:20:20 What A coward
337 2018-05-30 23:20:07 What is the actually number of death annually for rifles, isn't  it under 300?
338 2018-05-30 23:20:02 This is very sad. Nobody can ever think how the country with the biggest oil reserves could felt down so bad. You need half of a basic salary to pay for 2 pounds of meat. People are dying for starvation while our country is floating in oil.
339 2018-05-30 23:19:59 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
340 2018-05-30 23:19:56 I got you with my magical oil blend because lord knows I need to swoop in and get those strands right
341 2018-05-30 23:19:38 They probably were so the jewish bankers probably own the Saudi oil.

343 2018-05-30 23:19:29 Actually no, not that kind of transient worker - in the oil field, they are more likely to be working for a company that has benefits, they simply move around a lot. But thanks for the info. If there was one near me, I would certainly check it out.
344 2018-05-30 23:19:28 通じた(ギュッ) めっちゃしんどいがすぎますね…
345 2018-05-30 23:19:24 Is it about oil tankers? A pipeline? Putting the wrong size jacket on? Putting in on inside out? Laughs?...whatever distractions they can find, to distract the public again...from what this is really all about!
346 2018-05-30 23:19:20 Does this law promote snake oil salesmen?
347 2018-05-30 23:19:20 A whole FACT. Everything that comes with a luxury car is 10x more expensive from gas to the type of oil the car takes. People always looking for something to say smh.

351 2018-05-30 23:19:10 I thought pipe lines and the shipping of oil was safe ... Why do we need Oil spill practise drills ?
352 2018-05-30 23:19:07 Look up RSO Rick Simpson Oil on YouTube! Get some ACDC or Ringo’s gift to use as the plant material and put small dabs into clear fillable capsules from Amazon or GNC!
353 2018-05-30 23:19:07 But to evaluate all that you have to ignore fact we are the most armed nation in the world by far, correct? How can all the guns available not be at least in the equation? The only possible way it could be out is data denial
354 2018-05-30 23:19:03 Speaking as an RN. CBD oil is an excellent option that is probably legal and available in just about any state. If you can get an MMJ card do so it is cheaper in the long run than marinol (the synthetic pill form you were prescribed).
355 2018-05-30 23:19:02 I've protested pipelines, oil trains, captivity and for education funding...but, sadly, I got roped into playing a pawn in war. 
356 2018-05-30 23:18:59 If you think smith’s sticks are bad look at Otto’s. Big Pharma, Shell oil and s ton of defense contractors.
357 2018-05-30 23:18:53 No, direct payments to the companies to offset costs as well as tax breaks. These have nothing to do with equalization and everything to do with Fed’s supporting oil and gas as a whole.
358 2018-05-30 23:18:50 Today was my first day off in like 5 days.....
At 7am, Bj: “you tryna take me to school?” Sure 

3pm, mom: You don’t wanna do my hair tonight? Sure mom 

7pm, dad: “aye Uhm you know your car need an oil change right?” Yes dad 

Like leave me aloneeeee 
359 2018-05-30 23:18:44 I would’ve just gotten a fruit cup lmfao you should’ve came to the store and bought you some chicken, flour, oil, and Texas Pete and made your own
360 2018-05-30 23:18:43 getting my oil changed, trying to act like an adult and get some work done but I CANT because the chair I'm on is super tall and my feet can't touch the ground like a little kid SO naturally I'm sitting here kicking them back n forth thinking about that dreamy Kit Cloudkicker
361 2018-05-30 23:18:41 i gave her an oil change and a wash<33333
362 2018-05-30 23:18:34 Their stump sheathed in rose oil / anointed rose oil teased their myrish swamp
363 2018-05-30 23:18:28 I hope there are some safety provisions still remaining and that people will not be sold dangerous snake oil.
364 2018-05-30 23:18:13 I want to douse someone in oil and run their body all over....
365 2018-05-30 23:18:11 Alotta y’all couldn’t even afford to get an oil change on a foreign so stop it
366 2018-05-30 23:18:06 Most people just don't know about maintenance cost. Even if he did buy him something nice like a BMW or Mercedes and it somehow had low insurance. The cost for an oil change and shit gonna run you at least 200-300 if you going to the dealership. Not to mention any other work.
367 2018-05-30 23:18:02 It's a tough environment in the oil and gas industry, but Holland's stainless steel #nameplates are manufactured to last.
368 2018-05-30 23:17:54 Lol bottle of? Alcohol or beard oil?
369 2018-05-30 23:17:31 @POTUS @VP   Mr Pence. Is 95/5. = 50/50 If 95% gets trillions in oil and 95% land size of Russia ? School fail or what

373 2018-05-30 23:17:02 Is the palm oil used in the products you sell sustainable ?. If not you are contributing to the deforestation of @borneoaction and the extinction of Orangutans.
374 2018-05-30 23:16:57 Those drugs should be banned. May I suggest using frankincense essential oil, with organic coconut oil as a carrier. Take some rub it on your chest your sleep like a baby!!
375 2018-05-30 23:16:44 We need to education #Jamaicans about using #SolarEnergy. Depending too much on oil for everything. Plus #JPS always wants to increase their services. C’mon people wise up! C’mon Mr Prime Minister educate the people properly
376 2018-05-30 23:16:42 A lot of people know what's going on with big pharma and big oil but how  many can say they know about the shady tricks that the mattress  industry pulls?
377 2018-05-30 23:16:34 May have more to do with not wishing to affect currently high oil prices.
378 2018-05-30 23:16:01 you and i together would be like a four-alarm fire at an oil refinery
379 2018-05-30 23:16:01 Your videos make me want to experiment, make food, try new flavors. And hot oil, on all the things!
380 2018-05-30 23:15:59 The Hyundai dealership is the only place I trust to do anything msintence wise to my car. Luckily I haven’t needed anything except oil changes & a mileage care package I’m getting Friday
381 2018-05-30 23:15:58 i could but i wont list all the oil spills or the countless resesrch from numerous countries that show how much we are to blame for climate change the fucing lying of corp america
382 2018-05-30 23:15:52 I am very blessed and have never lost a child.  So right, we need to change everything that has ever cost a child's life. We have a lot of work to do. You are working on guns, I will work on pools.
383 2018-05-30 23:15:28 Check your Engine oil this morning.

390 2018-05-30 23:14:46 Lol 1950-2050 in the history books is gonna be about how we found oil and used it all. Built the world tho
391 2018-05-30 23:14:40 Heart breaking to witness the callous disregard we have for the planet that sustains us all and the impact of deforestation and palm oil monoculture in Borneo.

Your choices count. Boycott products with palm oil, check the label before you buy. Save orangutans! #RedApe
392 2018-05-30 23:14:10 Thinking of @Braveheart133 as I cook in my air fryer oil free cooking even @CantBDoinThis would approve
393 2018-05-30 23:14:03 This is your friendly periodic reminder that we are in the 105th year of oil company tax preferences.
394 2018-05-30 23:13:53 As long as there's an empty vessel, there will always be a steady supply of oil to fill it. #ThinkOnThat #MakeThatPersonal #2Kings4

399 2018-05-30 23:13:17 Did Nigeria exit the recession because of devaluation or oil price going up with production?
PMB didn't help with his delay no doubt, but stats says oil took us into recession & same oil took us out. Facts only.
400 2018-05-30 23:13:11 I'm sorry. I didn't realize that the 600,000 barrels of oil Canada imports were C02 free.. us silly Albertans. We just don't understand energy!
401 2018-05-30 23:13:10 It can be, but the US doesn't need to be. We are sitting on massive undeclared energy reserves. We throttle back production for geopolitical and social engineering reasons. The CIA controls all the firms that spot and develop new oil fields. No joke on that.

411 2018-05-30 23:12:06 Please share with us as to how you are able to predict international oil prices, three months in advance? This is for sure a key to become very rich.
412 2018-05-30 23:12:03 If we hook him up to a generator we would never need to pump or ship another drop of oil.

414 2018-05-30 23:11:48 And turn the loonie more into a petrocurrency and afflict the export economy when oil prices rise. The creating economy tanked in favor of the extracting economy.

Bernie Would Have Won Cutlery.

We didn't give Hillary financial control of the Democratic Party just to lose to someone who won't take bribes from Big Pharma, Big Oil, Private Schools, Private Prisons, Insurance Companies or the War Machine.

420 2018-05-30 23:11:26 @PMOIndia, @RahulGandhi, BalNarendra u , ur petroleum minister, cm of all states, CEO’s of all oil companies must be arrested for profiteering under Essential Commodities Act for profiteering by overtaxing because Petrol, Diesel, kerosene R essential commodities.
421 2018-05-30 23:11:25 A minority like yourself have chosen your ow  path . And want green energy. The majority of canada want and need oil products. So for the next foreseeable future the pipe must go ahead and also it is the major economic driver . To dispute this is no arguement. So do your best.
422 2018-05-30 23:11:17 They got a new Chanel Bleu out y’all boys more intense more oil...

427 2018-05-30 23:10:41 #IEmbarrasinglyAdmit I poured hot oil from the pan through a mesh sieve and wasn't expecting it when the sieve melted.

(also, I spelled sieve wrong twice before posting this tweet).

429 2018-05-30 23:10:27 When #Yorubas talk about #HumanRights they forget #Biafra because of oil, likewise binis & kogi's. There's no way #Nigerians will be happy seeing #Igbos go because of the name 'Biafra'. #BiafraHeroesDay
430 2018-05-30 23:10:09 And we had an endless supply of coconut oil. Amen.
431 2018-05-30 23:10:03 I just got my “changed my oil all on my own” merit badge.
432 2018-05-30 23:09:53 Yet you could care less if someone gets a gun from armslist and harms someone else’s family.
433 2018-05-30 23:09:52 I’ve been really moved by the @BBC 2 and @BorneoNature documentary: Red Ape: Save the Orangutan. There’s something wrong with a world that places a huge value on cheap palm oil over the lives of these beautiful animals - the Orangutans. Sad and shocked.
434 2018-05-30 23:09:40 Just roasted mine recently with olive oil, salt, pepper & garlic powder. Came out great!
435 2018-05-30 23:09:31 and ya...try and do anything in life without oil and money... good luck with that...not a shill... I'm a realist and you're living to fund George Soros and Coke Brothers Climate Change fund

437 2018-05-30 23:09:20 The duty of micro gravity is to push heavier elements down and shift lighter elements up. Like exactly like our earth., heavier element is in center The good example when you put a glass with half water and oil. micro gravity push the lighter element "OIL" up and the water down.
438 2018-05-30 23:09:17 Oil paint takes 3000 years to dry apparently
439 2018-05-30 23:09:08 Y’all know good and got damm well If offset bought you a Lamborghini or a Benz right now could you afford the maintenance ? You’d be so happy til it’s time to change the oil& insurance . Now you gotta sell it
440 2018-05-30 23:09:04 If we didn’t mind the coconutty flavour of unrefined coconut oil, would it behave similarly, as long as it was a solid?

444 2018-05-30 23:08:48 Mad because when I get out of the shower in the privacy of my house, I have cool slick anime Matrix hair

But when I get out of a public pool I look like goddamn oil rag Severus Snape
445 2018-05-30 23:08:38 There is nothing proactive in that, murder is illegal.., if you lost a child, sure, you would want the person brought to justice. But what happens is you want to prevent others from feeling the pain.

449 2018-05-30 23:08:18 Hmmm. So now that all Canadians own #TMX pipelines, BC citizens find their Gov’t spending public money in court to force AB to keep shipping oil and even more public money to not ship oil in a pipeline they now own a part of. Impressive! #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
450 2018-05-30 23:08:12 Yes and no because Saudi and Egypt are complicit, it also has to do with  oil and natural resources. #Genieenergy
451 2018-05-30 23:07:46 Three years ago you were protesting against the oil sands and pipelines.  Your memory is very short.
452 2018-05-30 23:07:29 Hope you are never in a position where you could have saved a loved one if you'd only had a gun.   I'd rather have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
453 2018-05-30 23:07:28 ...but you want my tax money to pay for your free ride, communistic utopia that has killed more people in history that any capitalist society ever has.  Oh, The Oil Sands are the largest climate clan up in human history...left alone they're poisoning the surrounding water table
454 2018-05-30 23:07:16 Plus time to update a lot of facts. Norway is not so nice these days.  The new Norwegian Government is taking billions from the Oil Fund to reduce government costs while bringing in austerity measures aimed at the working class. So do we want the Nordic model,

466 2018-05-30 23:05:23 ok but untill there not dependant on oil economically there an oil economy.
467 2018-05-30 23:05:19 We have to stop using palm oil. The world HAS to protect the rain forests and the orangutans. Such amazing beautiful creatures deserve our protection. They deserve to live in their world. 
468 2018-05-30 23:05:16 Can you honestly say that’s not a lot of it? Because when my female engineer friend was working on the oil leak issue in Texas that’s a lot of what she did..projections and estimations of the situation as well as the solution. But continue if you must.
469 2018-05-30 23:05:10 I don't see too many people standing up for our #warriorwomen who make tremendous sacrifices working in oil industry.. 

Don't see a lot of support for the youth in class of 2018 or 2019 who are pursuing oil industry work.
470 2018-05-30 23:05:09 My suggestions, however, would be to flush the transmission and see what that gives you. If you change it all out and don't see any signs of shavings, it could just be wear on the gears. Use a gear oil stabilizer or something to thicken the fluid a little.
471 2018-05-30 23:05:01 Alright everyone in order to win you must be the first to get the correct answer.Question: If you had only one match and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp, some kindling wood, and a newspaper, which would you light first?

476 2018-05-30 23:04:39 to do what? Make changes to a states gun laws? I have no illusions of banning all guns, I grew up on a farm in Texas, USMC family. If NRA has blocked any possible 2A changes legally since last gun ban that is horrible not great IMO we will see. Go USA. Hope you never lose a child
477 2018-05-30 23:04:37 A great low in oil prices in india..1 paisa remarkable acheivement , history will remember #thinking where to invest.
478 2018-05-30 23:04:36 Not to mention the fact that the liberation effort was to ensure Kuwaiti oil still flowed West! Do you think US would have intervened if Kuwait was a poor agricultural nation?

480 2018-05-30 23:04:16 yeah, it's Claire :)
it really is nebulous, but that's global capitalism for you. all of the science (and conjecture) surrounding the sustainability of American oil fields is really weird, too.
481 2018-05-30 23:04:03 I remember back then, my aunt will be screaming blood of Jesus & pouring anointing oil everywhere thinking her village people are after her.
482 2018-05-30 23:03:49 It might get disastrous n there'll be a lot of collateral damage
483 2018-05-30 23:03:45 Are you also against the exportation of millions of tons of thermal coal thru the port of VCR destined to China? More damaging to the atmosphere than oil I would think.
484 2018-05-30 23:03:29 2 small things on the smoke side.   Run vent for 10 mins before throwing on the steak and use grape seed oil.  You can throw butter in while the steak rests for some brown butter sauce.   Kind regards. —former 212
485 2018-05-30 23:03:22 Munir sb tbe real fact is of Int. Oil prices why try to make people fool. Pl note at preaent prices r around $69 per barrel and one month before when LC for june were opened they were around $74. So what govt can do in this regard. Unfortunatly u people never tell truth.

491 2018-05-30 23:03:03 Sweet ! I always wanted oil leaks between my oil changes
492 2018-05-30 23:03:00 If oil and natural gas are the lifeblood of the Texas economy, the almost 440,000 miles of pipelines are the critical veins and arteries that keep the Lone Star State's economy pumping. #WednesdayWisdom
493 2018-05-30 23:02:49 It has been the same in my family for generations with no issues.  It can be done. But if you never correct your child or give them consequences for their actions, you have a problem.
494 2018-05-30 23:02:48 Here's one, dilbit only sinks when it is mixed with clay, clay will not be in oil sent thru TMX.
Agreed, no one wants to change, and most don't know how much energy it takes to sit comfortably and watch pnp, and that hurts the debate

514 2018-05-30 23:00:19 I was raised in a home with loaded guns and no safe. I was taught what a gun was, gun saftey and knew if I touched a gun my dad would be all over me. I raised 2 kids with loaded guns. My safe is only locked when we leave the house. It is called education and consequences.

I freeze olive oil + herbs into ice cubes so i just drop a cube into a pan and it melts and bam seasoned whatever.
526 2018-05-30 22:59:17 I really wanna try using oil paint. Those that tried to which one y’all like better acrylic or oil

529 2018-05-30 22:59:07 the article argues that by letting companies develop American oil, Tr*mp can keep pushing on Iran with fewer consequences... 
i don't know enough about environmental science or global oil markets to support or deny that, but either way, U.S. foreign policy impacts oil exports.

540 2018-05-30 22:58:05 My brother has a Benz. I do not envy his insurance OR oil changes. Fuck that. My Toyota is GRAND.
541 2018-05-30 22:57:55 We have over 324 mil people in US,  we have over 400 mil guns in pvt homes with 12k deaths a year, which is less than 1%. We loose 60k a year to drugs!
542 2018-05-30 22:57:50 Sounds 5x more Delicious than big oil. Good luck on your new buisness venture.
543 2018-05-30 22:57:42 Well does your state have medical?  Oil will work pretty well so will just smoking a joint. Especially if a CBD strain

545 2018-05-30 22:57:26 @davidpakmanshow  The price of oil and gas is on the raise in anticipation of the Middle East raising the price per barrel
546 2018-05-30 22:57:22 Your tweet assumes we don’t practice safe storage. There are millions of gun owners in America who abide by the laws and practice gun safety, including safe storage. Otherwise you’d hear about it more than drunk driving, for example.
547 2018-05-30 22:57:09 The idea something “surely cannot be the solution” without even trying it is just so damn predetermined, with zero data to support-it’s just a bunch of hot air. 
Hypothetical, no matter how you spin it. Try something before claiming it won’t work. Action/data collection is key

.no more pharma in our house.
551 2018-05-30 22:56:49 Why are we discussing only gun deaths? Don't all deaths matter? We need drug control, pool control, knife control, etc....

553 2018-05-30 22:56:40 i’ve also heard that peppermint oil works

557 2018-05-30 22:56:11 Y’all want Offset to buy that man a luxury car for what? Do you know how expensive those things are to maintain? Gas, oil changes, tires, etc
558 2018-05-30 22:56:05 My boyfriend picked up my car yesterday, filled the tank with gas, changed my oil, and brought me coffee. I’m obsessed with him 
559 2018-05-30 22:56:04 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
560 2018-05-30 22:56:04 I'm not gonna argue with you there.
I did some pretty stupid stuff back in my racing days.
561 2018-05-30 22:56:01 Even more valid. He ain’t affording premium gas and oil changes.
562 2018-05-30 22:55:58 I’m tweeting on LTE like an oil tycoon.

566 2018-05-30 22:55:27 The Lucas Oil crowd is a little light tonight. You'd think a tropical storm is passing through or something.
567 2018-05-30 22:55:26 I wonder how early I can go get an oil change. 
568 2018-05-30 22:55:25 CBD peppermint oil on your pelvic area heals, bby
569 2018-05-30 22:55:00 It's the go to with the anti gun types
570 2018-05-30 22:54:48 I'm against regime change in iran 100% however, pulling out of the Iran deal sent oil shares to the sky, geopolitics will never be understood unless the financial side is counted as well, otherwise there will be constant confusion as to X president's agenda.
571 2018-05-30 22:54:23 Getting an oil change is always so freaking AKWARD!!!!! All the guys that work here start acting weird.
572 2018-05-30 22:54:23 Let's see, we have abortion on demand,  more violent movies and video games but the family unit itself is falling apart. Children are not being taught respect for others or human life and want instant satisfaction. We have way more drug deaths per year than gun deaths.

576 2018-05-30 22:53:46 Hopefully the Stepford voters will wake up when their miniscule tax break goes into the pockets of the oil companies.
577 2018-05-30 22:53:45 I wonder if  Sarah @PressSec really knows what people are thinking of her or Barr.  I'm thinking of cliffs, oil, tar and feathers.
578 2018-05-30 22:53:41 Caetano was a unanimous reaffirmation of both.
579 2018-05-30 22:53:38 Mr Horgan is so concerned about the coast and tankers. Why isn’t he concerned about the hundreds of inland lakes and rivers the oil laden trains pass by many times daily?
580 2018-05-30 22:53:37 We did not want any war or restrainds... we wanted other solutions, mh17 changed all that.. but in a time where usa changed from importing 50% of all worlds oil, they became exporteur... and Russia supplies Europe
581 2018-05-30 22:53:36 My 10 yr old Acura (Acura not even a BMW) was like $100 for oil changes and I paid $700 for breaks  even the tires were more expensive. Glad I left that life for a Camry.
582 2018-05-30 22:53:35 I accidentally put a little bit of olive oil instead of vegetable oil in the pancakes me & Jeffrey are eating for dinner right now & I hope he doesn’t notice 
583 2018-05-30 22:53:29 And it’s something he can afford and maintain ! Nigga can’t pay for a oil change on a Benz or bmw if he was already walking 
584 2018-05-30 22:53:23 @acoyne is anti oil? That's a curious thing to say.
585 2018-05-30 22:53:15 smothered myself in baby oil feelin all fresh

588 2018-05-30 22:53:09 so, basically, the president's foreign policy positions affect other countries' attitudes towards us and their capacity to export, and that can effect oil prices. like sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, which reduce their oil exports by tens of thousands of barrels.
589 2018-05-30 22:53:06 look at the american economy where 13 percent is energy where as azerbijan its over half thats not a real economy thats an oil economy with other things mixed in
590 2018-05-30 22:53:06 Going to do my first oil change on the Audi help is appreciated... or if you just want a good laugh watching me attempt this that is welcome as well hmu
591 2018-05-30 22:53:03 yeah i think vegetable oil gonna fit
592 2018-05-30 22:52:57 Okay today I’ve decided coconut oil is the devil

594 2018-05-30 22:52:49 They will still say APC MBuhari is not doing anything,becos they can’t loot players allowances & ticket money anymore,under PDP bonus & ticket wahala, no grade A friendly.And the price of oil was high compared to now.some pple will pocket d money.
595 2018-05-30 22:52:42 def! theres a lot of scam sites out there, but theyre 100% legit -- theyre florida based too. ive gotten lollipops & oil from them. 
596 2018-05-30 22:52:38 Reducing oil prices in this context means ending sanctions on Iran. Schumer isn't going to do that. So in addition to being stupid it's also hypocritical and cynical.
597 2018-05-30 22:52:33 There's 5 insults. You are quite hostile.
Modern sporting arms were at 1994 unusual. They aren't now by SCOTUS' very reasoning in deciding Caetano unanimously.
598 2018-05-30 22:52:19 How are gonna use the charcoal oil?
599 2018-05-30 22:52:18 Does anyone in the Altoona area know of any garages that use Amsoil filters and oil for oil changes? My former garage is no longer in business.

606 2018-05-30 22:51:48 And when has Notley ever stand up for Alberta threats about cutting off oil which never happened. Buy beer instead of wine ?? Hardly a track records of standing of for Albertans
607 2018-05-30 22:51:46 If we lived in a nation that was struggling with kids dying from left over land mines, would you propose more land mines as the solution? Not joking, serious. Would any possible agreed solution not include removing the land mines? Less land mines = less land mine deaths
608 2018-05-30 22:51:37 Iran: Total oil company has 60 days to secure US sanctions waiver
609 2018-05-30 22:51:35 I must have missed the part about God in everyone's tweets.  But, yes growing up with a religious teaching helps give a moral compass.  We need to make sure our children are being taught respect for others,  compassion and the respect for human life.
610 2018-05-30 22:51:28 May Allah grant him jannah
611 2018-05-30 22:51:10 @JesseDuplanti10 What a smarmy, disgusting snake oil salesman .. bilking gullible people out of the little money they have to buy you a $54 million jet.  There's a place in hell for the likes of you!!
612 2018-05-30 22:51:03 I’ve recently read that the US has become a major exporter of oil.  Is it Canadian oil the buy at a huge discount? Or, their own oil with our oil supplementing their domestic needs. Same thing I guess.
613 2018-05-30 22:50:54 @dpakman IMO gas prices are affected by the 45 administration's disregard of corporate greed and a wholesale embrace of fossil fuel corps. In CA, our gas prices go up on a whim, don't go back down, and the oil corps are never held to account.
614 2018-05-30 22:50:45 Then you have nothing to worry about.
What I would be concerned about is losing the slim majority on SCOTUS.
A 5-4 ruling on both Heller and Mcdonald can be overturned very easily.
615 2018-05-30 22:50:44 There's way to quiet down anxiety, one we highly recommend is CBD oil, it will keep you calm during the storm
616 2018-05-30 22:50:35 Most of the carbon pollution from barrel of Hibernia oil or oilsand comes from me, you & everyone else on the roads when we drive. I think all polluters should pay, you think none should, that's convenient. Kenney actually more progressive than NL PCs

618 2018-05-30 22:50:27 It's hard. Life is hard. I just.... I need more efforts but everytime I burnt my midnight oil, all I see was only the weak side of me, lacking in everything, no matter how hard I tried, I can never achieve the level of feeling contented.

My dream is still vague...
619 2018-05-30 22:50:26 Another pro corporate anti consumer legislation.
This will mostly impact terminally ill people who are desperate to try anything. I feel for their plight and have their best interests at heart when I say snake oil is not in your interest. Stick to proven treatments
620 2018-05-30 22:50:21 The water is dark because of the oil drilling in the gulf. We get it in waves here in Florida
621 2018-05-30 22:50:01 That's the 4th time I've counted you disparage others in conversation that you yourself lament is lacking.
622 2018-05-30 22:49:43 There’s nothing better than coming home from work shower and put lavender oil all over your tired body 
623 2018-05-30 22:49:33 I'm not saying standing a podium up next to a gas station is good politics. I'm saying that oil prices are a significant factor in economic well-being, and a presidential role in their trend is not uncommon.
624 2018-05-30 22:49:27 My tire screeches when I drive and I don't know if it's from being dirty, needing oil or letting me know it's ready to die
625 2018-05-30 22:49:13 Vitamin E oil or lotion. Use it asap and often. It might be pricey.

But it is more : To distract from #OxyContin lobby $50 billion profits & #OPEC S.Arabia/Gulf decision to cut Oil supplies & push Oil barrel to $100

636 2018-05-30 22:48:31 Buy me Cannabis oil for my vape pen
637 2018-05-30 22:48:26 I would suggest to try CBD oil before any pharmaceuticals
638 2018-05-30 22:48:24 Yeah I made my account private because I felt like an asshole for trashing that book and because I’m tweeting about cbd oil.
639 2018-05-30 22:48:21 Dangerous and unusual arms? Is that what you're discussing?
Semiautomatic arms, even modern sporting arms while dangerous, are not unusual.
Read Heller and Caetano.
640 2018-05-30 22:48:12 To what extent are oil prices (controlled in no small by people's fears) a by-product of blowing up the Iran deal and having John Bolton help set Mideast policy?
641 2018-05-30 22:48:03 So sorry to hear that about your dad. Try CBD oil or capsules. Typically more affordable and can assist w/ pain, appetite, and overall calmness/relaxation.

645 2018-05-30 22:47:26 i thought that was an oil slick
646 2018-05-30 22:47:20 David, maybe CBD oil will help, you can get it from Hemp and it’s legal to order online. NATIVEHEMP SOLUTIONS. it’s HEMP NOT Marijuana and has no THC. But the CBD oil extract might help.
647 2018-05-30 22:47:09 Where can I get vape oil in Lagos ?
648 2018-05-30 22:47:07 so i guess by your logic the saudis arnt dependant on us either. yes we do protect azerbaijan just as we protect most the oil countries of the middle east. your trying to apply an oil based country with no real economy but oil to europe and america not exaclty apples to apples.
649 2018-05-30 22:47:01 Grilled potatoes and corn. S and p with oil for potato. Butter and pepper for corn
650 2018-05-30 22:46:56 In the 3 min walk between subway stations I saw vomit, an NYU college graduate in cap and gown, took a pic of Times Square, and watched a roasted nut food cart owner throw his hot oil in the street. #NYC is magical.

653 2018-05-30 22:46:39 U saying the solution is we all worship the same god as you? How insulting & unrealistic is that? To those who want to see action on guns, this comes off as deflective. We have more guns than anywhere (measurable). But morals? How?other nations have moral variation without deaths
654 2018-05-30 22:46:31 its not that type of oil

659 2018-05-30 22:46:06 A wonderful spell - brought back happy memories of Ted Hughes Otter : Underwater eyes, an eel's 
Oil of water body, neither fish nor beast is the otter: 
Four-legged yet water-gifted, to outfish fish; 
With webbed feet and long ruddering tail 
And a round head like an old tomcat.
660 2018-05-30 22:45:38 Sir you’re a fortune teller if you knew oil will reach $80/barrel. I really hope you invested in oil futures and made millions for yourself.
661 2018-05-30 22:45:35 If you drank olive oil that and everything else you've got in you will soon pass. :D

Look how shiny my shoes are!
667 2018-05-30 22:44:55 Find a source for some weed.  Easy medicinal cannabis coconut oil: Use approx 1/4 oz flower to 2 cups oil. Bake on sheet at 220 for 10-15 minutes til golden, slow cook in oil for 3 hrs.  Strain w/ cheesecloth.  Take 1-2 tsp 2x daily in ginger or mint tea.  Prayers to your dad.
668 2018-05-30 22:44:54 There were no changes to make 1994 "ban" happen.
There is also almost 100 years of SCOTUS decisions (the last one unanimous-even rbg agreed) that would need to be overturned for your dream to become reality.
669 2018-05-30 22:44:47 :D you come here and bring one. My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment… The thing on the left is adorable…
670 2018-05-30 22:44:43 don't forget all the opiods in the water in the west coast. and the oil along the southern coast. oh, and fracking! that good things to water, too.
671 2018-05-30 22:44:42 Newsflash: most citizens are polluters and the bulk of the pollution from oil comes from burning it in cars and end users ie consumers etc
672 2018-05-30 22:44:40 Even if it's replacing oil or NG or coal? It serves a good purpose.
673 2018-05-30 22:44:39 and what woukd happen to those companies after they pumped out snake oil to their customers?
674 2018-05-30 22:44:36 I luv aloe n castor oil so much

677 2018-05-30 22:43:56 I knew when conversation like this pops up 
I trust her to always be there to oil the engine but that’s just an observation of mine
678 2018-05-30 22:43:45 If only you were smart you'd realize that oil will be outdated very soon and that the best way to guarantee Canada's interests is to invest in clean energies and train those workers in it. You are definitely not an environmental leader. Shame on you.
679 2018-05-30 22:43:35 Little q-tip from le moi: if you got thighs thicker than Christmas, & you don’t have anti-chaffing cream, body oil works just as well, & it lasts long too, at least for me. if it doesn’t have glitter in it, put glitter! you can use it as shimmery stuff! And you’ll be moisturized!
680 2018-05-30 22:43:25 It’s almost like some states can sustain their own oil supply or something
681 2018-05-30 22:43:24 Jason Kenney supports a carbon tax on the oil sands which are gigantic compared to NL so if Alberta Tories ware willing to do that and don't see economic downside pretty hard to make a case for now. Also NL and Canada are very large per capita emitters.
682 2018-05-30 22:43:23 You do realize you have oil changes, the type of gas the car takes, tags, insurance. He got the man something he would be able to afford for years to come. Y’all always looking for some negative out of a positive situation. Damn. Mfs take stingiest over gratefulness any day I see
683 2018-05-30 22:43:23 Would CBD oil help? It may be legal. Or, would getting a medical marijuana license help? Is that possible for him? 
684 2018-05-30 22:43:21 Ha ha ha,
Maybe even used cars oil
685 2018-05-30 22:43:20 Maybe buying your mom a house. Yo these ppl have Railroads, yo they got structural institutions. Somewhere Bush got a nephew running oil, next thing you know he’ll be running for state Senate somewhere. Like word, we lucky to get Dax hair grease company
686 2018-05-30 22:43:12 It has taken me literal years to get from "Chevron oil" to "talentil gelato"
687 2018-05-30 22:43:07 It a huge money racket. Drug companies that is, they rip people off as bad or worse than oil companies.
688 2018-05-30 22:43:05 Gotta love that little podium sign, what, asking constituents to demand lower gas prices? So, if prices go up as he takes big oil money, it won't be his fault he will wave his finger at the public. May as fucking well ask for prayers instead.
689 2018-05-30 22:43:04 Is Big Mood a villain like Big Oil and Big Fire.
690 2018-05-30 22:43:03 Manniy oil mantri bol rahe unka oil rate per koi control nhi h bhaiyo fr kahe kursi se chipke ho jub koi kam hi nhi bekar m public k tax amount le rahe oil ministry band kijiy
691 2018-05-30 22:42:45 I work with pharma and biotech companies and I can assure you that companies would stop paying for clinical trials and poison snake oil would enter the market
692 2018-05-30 22:42:44 Government may try to invade it for oil
693 2018-05-30 22:42:44 In unrelated news, the oil Canada doesn’t produce will be gladly produced by other nations.
694 2018-05-30 22:42:36 Burning the midnight oil for tomorrow's Intro Physiology exam, and seeing everyone's spirit for this year's Harvest Festival back home has given me more motivation! Kotobian Tadau Tagazo do Kaamatan! #Kaamatan2018
695 2018-05-30 22:42:36 I use a vape pen with Indica oil. The pen is rechargeable. I think I paid around $25 for the pen, $30-35 for the Indica oil (550 mg.) The oil lasts me about a month. I’m in Colorado. Idk what State you’re in, but $750 for a pill is ridiculous!
696 2018-05-30 22:42:29 Again, we have work within non value added construct that was not present in 1994. You understand that, yes?
Gun ownership is...wrong? Well, you're predetermined answers to your 5 why is clear now.
The 1994 "ban" did not ban what you think.
Educate yourself on the subject matter.
697 2018-05-30 22:42:24 Cleansing oil tu kalau pakai baby oil pun bole ke
698 2018-05-30 22:42:21 It comes down to how quickly we can transition. Oil is a stop gap until we can. But that does not mean we should continue to increase production either.
699 2018-05-30 22:42:13 Do you have plan to address these issues?
700 2018-05-30 22:42:03 Your mistake is assuming progressive leftist voters in Calgary are anti-oil. Those are not mutually exclusive. Most believe we need to get as much value as possible from oil/oil sands to diversify into green industries. Until green is as cheap as oil nothing will change.
701 2018-05-30 22:42:00 $NEWR after tomorrow,  short this to $40 snake oil ceo
702 2018-05-30 22:42:00 The toes i’ve seen on the subway at least file them and put on some cuticle oil 
703 2018-05-30 22:41:53 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
704 2018-05-30 22:41:52 Shutup bob.stay bought by big oil.
705 2018-05-30 22:41:51 Idgaf how much money I make... I refuse to pay 200 dollars for an oil change.
706 2018-05-30 22:41:49 And how many states have the right to bear arms in their constitution?  #notgoingtohappen
707 2018-05-30 22:41:49 #NightShift - Commodores singing lovely 

I'm on a night shift,  burning the midnight oil.  If you a night bird  like me, may I know!
708 2018-05-30 22:41:45 The oil industry is a long way from dying. Demand is growing everyday.

Canada IS transitioning. We have 3 huge wind farms that are producing power right now in Northeastern BC. There simply is no tech in place for us to cap all the wells today.
709 2018-05-30 22:41:28 .. same time, Nigeria being a mono economy heavily reliant on oil for revenue, prices kept rising to 120 dollar/barrel plus over 50 billion dollars in the foreign reserve but still..
710 2018-05-30 22:41:27 This oil pen is life right now
711 2018-05-30 22:41:22 Wow what insect is it? Did you drown it with lignocaine or good ole olive oil?

713 2018-05-30 22:41:12 Last time i came to get a massage shorty just mad oil on me, i was blown
714 2018-05-30 22:41:08 Not at all, he is against the federal plan of taxing everyone, he supports taxing the polluters, which there are many in the oil fields. We have 5 or 6 emitters here in our province Will! We are a speck of dust to the world and Canadian scene. Smoke in mirrors nonsense
715 2018-05-30 22:41:06 They wanted Offset to buy dude a Rolls...you know, so he could wind up carjacked in the hood when all dude needs to do is get to work...and be able to afford his oil change... #ingrates
716 2018-05-30 22:41:02 D: So the cyst is located near a major artery. When I drain it, we don’t want any blood in it. Ready?
M: Yeah do it.
*inserts needle
D: Here’s the oil from the cy- oh my god there’s blood!

LOOOOL k thanks doc 
717 2018-05-30 22:41:02 @marvinwinans Bishop I wanna come under your covering 
 I believe in the oil of God that's on your life I would love to have information on how to join PFI . Bishop I need the strength . I'm Samuel Green pastor of Remnant Church Kingdom Ministries
718 2018-05-30 22:40:58 Imagine if the UK hadn’t spent any oil revenue and instead did as Norway and created a sovereign wealth fund. Imagine if Scotland had had devolution in the 70’s when oil was discovered!
719 2018-05-30 22:40:55 Your solution won't solve the problem. The illusion is that guns are the problem. The problem that needs addressing is people and their lack of moral compass. Lack of value of life. Violent tendencies. The tool is not the problem. Banning any of them won't solve the problem.

723 2018-05-30 22:40:38 Was he supposed to buy the man a Bentley and the first oil changed cost him 5k.
724 2018-05-30 22:40:38 Lol.
Give me a cold-air intake, turbo, exhaust, and some NOS, and I'll get that Fiero to smoke a stock Lamborghini off the line.
725 2018-05-30 22:40:30 Yes, that is true but there are base loads that do not depend on fossil fuels. We are developing tidal energy for instance here in NS. Necessity is also the mother of invention. If oil production was discouraged, bright folks will adapt and alternatives would be found.
726 2018-05-30 22:40:28 Texas gets a huge amount of money from oil and gas extraction so there goes that idea. Florida has great winters so they don’t spend a lot on snow plowing or other winter related expenses so forget Florida.
727 2018-05-30 22:40:22 Pictured: oil shortages due to the 1973 OPEC oil crisis and the 1979 Iranian oil crisis, not summer price increases, somehow wildly devaluing your own argument.

Funny how that happen.

729 2018-05-30 22:40:17 And rifles in general kill less than knives or hammers!
730 2018-05-30 22:39:56 I agree with the general concept but high oil prices have been a leading factor in most of the recessions of the past 40 years, including (some argue) the Great Recession
731 2018-05-30 22:39:43 Hell no!!!!
732 2018-05-30 22:39:34 Seems to happen all the time huh, following all... what are we chopped liver lol
733 2018-05-30 22:39:16 of course they don't. Too much oil
734 2018-05-30 22:38:50 •coconut oil

•baking soda
•aloe vera
•brown sugar 
•tea tree oil
•almond oil
735 2018-05-30 22:38:43 Exactly!!! Bc Big Oil has him in their pocket. They have billions to influence the outcome. I l reason the corrupt POS is still in office.
736 2018-05-30 22:38:38 In Saudi Arabia? God no.. Egypt has workers parties. Iran has youth movements. Turkey has modern secular movements. Saudi is a totalitarian state that oppresses an entire segment of it's population to keep oil flowing. I mean... They've gotten BETTER. They're not GOOD.
737 2018-05-30 22:38:37 I remember gas at 25 cents. Five dollars out of every work day paid rent in a month. You saved & paid cash or went without. Nixon's price freeze. Duck & cover drills. Leaving school because of bomb scares.
The margin of disparity between wealth & poverty has changed 10 fold since
738 2018-05-30 22:38:25 RSO (oil) given rectally did wonders for my mom when she was battling terminal cancer. Depending on the vendor it can be fairly expensive, but he need only take it 1x day for up to a month.

743 2018-05-30 22:37:51 how tf you a grown ass man and still got you dad coming with you to get an oil change

747 2018-05-30 22:37:34 Technically that's two vegetables:  onions, and the vegetable oil they're cooked in.
748 2018-05-30 22:37:24 Great BJP has reduced the price of petrol and diesel by 1 paise had this happened in western country CEO Indian oil and minister would have lost the job
749 2018-05-30 22:37:23 The only people hating on the car Offset bought that man can't afford their oil changes because their phone bill is too high.

I wish lesser people didn't have opinions.
750 2018-05-30 22:37:23 shorty moving like the oil from the salami poppin back at her
751 2018-05-30 22:37:20 Both. I'm sick of that insane liberal argument.
752 2018-05-30 22:37:17 I have to get a oil change tomorrow seriously 
753 2018-05-30 22:37:01 Just buy marijuana the same as everyone else !  It will work as well , if he can’t smoke get the oil

KJV. Exodus 37:29
756 2018-05-30 22:36:49 yes but that is a realiance on the us it give them the advantage of being able to buy and sell oil to anyone because they all accept dollars. if the us wasnt protecting it all of the middle eastt would be china and they wouldnt buy the oil they would take it.
757 2018-05-30 22:36:44 Sitting outside it’s so humid I feel like a oil ball 
758 2018-05-30 22:36:42 sure, transport is Canada's 2d biggest CO2 source after oil/gas industry. Lots of efforts underway to slow the transition to EVs
759 2018-05-30 22:36:42 Lol. I ain’t fighting back. But best believe that the kettle and warm oil will be my buddies.
760 2018-05-30 22:36:32 @IEA APPROVE NASSIM HARAMEINS PATIENTS IN 2011 HIS ASSISTANT SLIPPED AND TOLD ME THEY HAVE A CYCLING QUARTZ CRYSTAL PUT OUT MASSIVE VOLTAGE LETS GET RID OF DIRTY OLD OIL
761 2018-05-30 22:36:28 But having beef-broth coating on MacD's French fries is not fake. So even being fried in veg oil, it's likely not kosher;)
762 2018-05-30 22:36:19 That argument about what should or shouldn't be in civilian hands is tired and false. Civilians should have whatever weapon they want. There are millions of legal auto guns in the US, and none used in mass shootings in decades.

764 2018-05-30 22:36:02 god this cold is drying me the fuck out. i need an almond oil bath
765 2018-05-30 22:35:58 I make my own stuff, which works better than all the stupid store bought stuff. I mix in a bottle coconut oil, argon oil, jojoba oil, shea oil, a small amount of witch hazel, a small amount of tea tree oil and use it daily. It absorbs in the skin really quickly & kills the burn.
766 2018-05-30 22:35:58 My daddy was a mechanic & lord knows I can’t do an oil change!
767 2018-05-30 22:35:56 bought some oil pastels, charcoal, and gesso. and a new sketchbook be mine is almost done 
768 2018-05-30 22:35:51 every 3 days the trump investigation is "bigger then we imagined" .. at this point if it doesn't have aliens chillin with saros and the Koch brothers giving alien money to both major parties at the wirds satanist place with the oil thing.. it's gonna be underwhelming
769 2018-05-30 22:35:25 @atDavidHoffman please go to a state with legal marijuana and get him oil, as good if not better. Both Sativa and Indica strains are hugely beneficial.
770 2018-05-30 22:35:20 And to be cleaner then want to buy Saudi, Venezuelan and Nigerian oil?
771 2018-05-30 22:35:13 There wouldnt have been any better way to manage it. Dont forget,$ was already 250 before the PMB admin came in as politicians were busy buying all the $ avaialble to hide their naira or ship out their ill gotten wealth. Oil price low,no foreign reserve and we love imported goods
772 2018-05-30 22:34:59 Is there anything coconut oil can’t do?

Environmentally toxic Tar Sands "oil" is becoming ethically and politically toxic.
I wonder how long it will be, before the boycotts start?

778 2018-05-30 22:33:43 Yes! Especially the cbd oil which is know to cure some cancers, it relieves anxiety without the high effects!
779 2018-05-30 22:33:42 I'm sorry. Can he just get some CBD oil online? Worth a try.
780 2018-05-30 22:33:25 Bolt action Remington 700 hunting rifles are far closer to  M24 sniper's  rifles, than a AR15 is to a M16 or M4.
781 2018-05-30 22:33:22 These pipelines exacerbated the problem of 1 consumer, the right’s heros in the US, who screw us on our oil. Harper built non-tidewater pipelines. No heavy lifting, lots of sucking, blowing. Don’t u think 10 years in power is enuf time to get a tidewater pipeline built? #cdnpoli
782 2018-05-30 22:33:21 There is no reason for gas prices to go up we have our own oil we have  Our own refineries here we can be self sufficient again with our own food our own cattle
783 2018-05-30 22:33:16 Gaza got oil
784 2018-05-30 22:33:10 I remember thinking my stretch marks would never ever go away but it's been so long since I was fat and they're pretty much gone now. Thank you tubby me for applying lots of coconut oil on myself.
785 2018-05-30 22:33:09 A car that takes regular gas, gets good gas mileage, regular oil changes, low maintenance, will last him 200k miles and has great resale/trade in value if he ever needs to get rid of it...this is a come up
786 2018-05-30 22:33:06 I wonder how many seconds in that minute until the barrel melts down or some fouling occurs?
787 2018-05-30 22:33:05 On the contrary, it makes them look very incompetent. Prices were much lower during GMA's time even with extremely high oil prices and the dollar exchange rate reaching P55.
788 2018-05-30 22:32:57 Use that beard oil i told u bout cuzz 
789 2018-05-30 22:32:53 I really hope you got that oil change.
790 2018-05-30 22:32:35 Oh very interesting! I noticed Taçi Oil reportedly sold off 80% of its ARMO oil refining business in 2013... wonder if that had anything to do with the switch? Let me know what you find out!
791 2018-05-30 22:32:30 I just heard Saskatchewan oil sheik Brad Wall praising Trudeau’s pipeline because he’s committed to bringing “oil to tidewater.” Hmm. Oil in tidewater is exactly what pipeline opponents are worried about. #KinderMorganPipeline #trudeoil
792 2018-05-30 22:32:29 they are very reliant on oil and the us. not a stable and booming economy.
793 2018-05-30 22:32:29 To dumb people yes, he should have bought a Lambo that the guy wouldn't even be able buy an oil change for. Insurance for a lambo? LMAO!

799 2018-05-30 22:31:51 chicken oil in jt’s happened 
800 2018-05-30 22:31:50 Stripped maybe. 

There is a line and you know it. My family left our M4s with Uncle Sam. Some of us did not serve in a war zone to come home to one. 

There is whole arsenal you can not own. Changing the list does not require 2A challenge according some legal experts.
801 2018-05-30 22:31:45 Watered down M-4's.......  oh my!
802 2018-05-30 22:31:38 Can you imagine how heavy the gun would be if it could hold 600 rounds?  Ammo belts are heavy just by themselves.
803 2018-05-30 22:31:37 Oil painting  who's this?
804 2018-05-30 22:31:36 Deservedly so. If I was the spokesperson for a snake oil company that was claiming to cure (insert disease here) with a pill I’d be doing my job too. Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t deserve the backlash. She speaks for a house of lies. Should we pretend that’s ok because it’s her job?
805 2018-05-30 22:31:25 So that makes him less credable? Because his parents made good decisions and helped him? Like Obama had his education paid for by Saudi Arabia.  Or Hillary and her connections ? Bush being from the oil family.What about Anderson Cooper? Where do you wanna stop on the propaganda?
806 2018-05-30 22:31:16 Your hair is porous so if you soak it with fresh water or coconut oil before swimming, it will absorb much less chemicals!
807 2018-05-30 22:31:12 Oh wait! We found oil
808 2018-05-30 22:31:10 Oh, my. Those moccasins will be submerged by all of that oil. (I know that I don’t have the background to make such a loaded statement - does he?)
809 2018-05-30 22:31:09 Well... until we all stop being crackheads for oil we need it and might as well make a buck off it. Im all for weaning but it will take time.
810 2018-05-30 22:31:05 총괄 정환이 우주 최고
811 2018-05-30 22:30:58 LOL. Do you find it ironic that in some remote areas solar energy is used to pump fossil fuel (crude oil) from the ground?
812 2018-05-30 22:30:58 The latest on this, India is going to pay with rupees for Iranian oil, to by pass the U.S. sanctions.
813 2018-05-30 22:30:45 "Haha you took three weeks to beat a game!"

You Google searched someone's trophy list and lied about playing and beating a game like a fraud because his enjoyment got you in your emotions. 

You and self awareness are like oil and water.
814 2018-05-30 22:30:43 Yes. Anyone who wants to change our society's dependence on oil - should just wave their magic wands and drive around in vehicles powered by Mr Fusion units instead. 

Or maybe it's more complicated, and infrastructure needs to be changed to support sustainable practice, too.
815 2018-05-30 22:30:38 Wow coconut oil really makes me look like a fresh Krispy kreme doughnut
816 2018-05-30 22:30:37 You can get cbd oil basically anywhere now. Letting a 15 year old smoke thc is not the way. Go to your local tobacco store or order it offline. As much as weed, is you could get cbd oil drops for waaay less.
817 2018-05-30 22:30:32 k that they were in 2001.
In resumen, we were in deficit, piling debt, and in constant inflation, the conditions that allowed the country to grow despite populism that were the rise in commodities like oil and soy are not here anymore, and leftist want even more spending.
818 2018-05-30 22:30:28 But don't Nestlé make like everything! I'm finding it harder and harder to buy stuff in shops...between Palm oil, Nestlé, avoiding Israeli products...trying to buy Irish fish but that comes from Norway! 
819 2018-05-30 22:30:25 If we are going to toddler deaths, do we get to talk about swimming pools and how many toddlers drown?
820 2018-05-30 22:30:20 Youre so welcome  
My mom has had some luck with EMDR therapy and CBD oil for her PTSD but I know there are a few different fairly effective options in regards to treatment. I wish you all the best!
821 2018-05-30 22:30:17 You know I had that same sense of dread listening to your last podcast. Too many years of bad drafting. Oilers have very little trade assets. Even with the best player there may be no quick fix. Oil have no means to acquire any right shot D or top line winger.  Hmm consequences.
822 2018-05-30 22:30:14 salsa verde? Blend it with olive oil, lemon juice, lots of garlic, salt, pepper. Put it on everything in sight.

824 2018-05-30 22:30:12 Nigga going to jail for not having insurance or that shit’s gonna break down because he can’t afford the oil change smh
825 2018-05-30 22:30:08 When was growing up there was a lot of things you could do with Olive Oil but cooking wasn't one of them. Moisturize your skin. Oil your hair. Olive oil is expensive and you couldn't be burning it up trying to fry chicken. That's what that big can of 'Crisco' was for.
826 2018-05-30 22:30:08 Check this company out. I suffer from chronic pain and their honey helps tremendously! @sweetblues420 You can buy online and have it shipped to you. Also, CBD oil is worth a try, is legal, & not $$$.
827 2018-05-30 22:30:02 Gloria may have been corrupt but she managed to keep prices during her watch despite the high oil prices and global economic downturn.

832 2018-05-30 22:28:56 Came into @ToyotaofOlympia to get my oil changed and I was blown away by how great this place is. Had to keep my head down so I wasn’t tempted to get a new car  #temptations #ihatewaiting #SOON
833 2018-05-30 22:28:51 I wouldnt advocate for Rush either.. But why does it surprise you that if oil prices jumps as much as it did during the Bush era that oil tycoons would make record profits. I mean they would make more money selling less oil.
834 2018-05-30 22:28:43 And where can we get one?
835 2018-05-30 22:28:38 mfs would rather have a old ass bmw and be paying for them high ass oil changes nshit just to say they got a bmw .
836 2018-05-30 22:28:27 love (Spanish) peppers... fried in olive oil!

840 2018-05-30 22:28:05 #EkPaisaJoke 
This Ache Din ki sarkar thinks that we people are fool. First they increased oil prices by 10 Rupees and then feeding us bheekh of 1 Paise??they also played with the farmers by granting farm loan waive of Re. 1, Rs. 5,& even 5 Paise in U.P & M.P.
841 2018-05-30 22:27:53 To make it more complicated: If you dig into Taçi Oil History you find out that Anoil was apparently part of Taçi at some point. When exactly I don’t know (yet)... but that makes the question as to when the changes were a bit more difficult.
842 2018-05-30 22:27:50 It gets tiring when the only ones compromising are gun owners.  It never ends.  Take NY-pre Sandy Hook they had 10rd limit on magazines capacity, post Sandy Hook its now 7.  We give today-we have nothing tomorrow.
843 2018-05-30 22:27:37 coconut oil is the very slippery glue that holds my life together

846 2018-05-30 22:27:20 Shaving your legs and smothering them with coconut oil is such a mood.
847 2018-05-30 22:27:12 The trade deficits are real, but the national debt... completely imaginary. I still laugh when I think we paid $15M for a third of our nation in Louisiana Purchase and the bought Alaska for $50M . Gave us the largest oil and gas reserves on the planet.
848 2018-05-30 22:27:08 Why would dilbit be an issue, as opposed to other type of crude oil?
849 2018-05-30 22:26:58 Damn sweet who pissed in your que oil today???
850 2018-05-30 22:26:54 The good news. I have heard their oil wells run dry by 2020. Hope it’s true.
851 2018-05-30 22:26:50 Nothing annoys me more than when I go somewhere for car issues and I have no idea what they’re talking about and they belittle you for not knowing the shit they do. Okay you toothless fucker enjoy changing oil for the rest of your life.
852 2018-05-30 22:26:31 You do realize that prices are going up worldwide, mostly because OPEC and Russia agreed to limit production, and President OBAMA signed a bill in 2015 to remove the ban on exporting US crude oil, right? Because you would know that if you did just a bit of research. But Trump!!!
853 2018-05-30 22:26:07 Street fighter 4 hakkan man covers himself in baby oil and shows the true power of silky smooth skin
854 2018-05-30 22:26:03 They fed 38 subjects who were already overweight and likely had a lot of metabolic dysfunction going on. Chimps get much of their energy from SFA from palm oil nuts, so it would be interesting to see a study like this with a better sample size and healthy controls.
855 2018-05-30 22:25:57 Tf y’all wanted Offset to buy him? A G wagon? Lmaoooooooo who paying for that oil change or blown out tail light?

859 2018-05-30 22:25:33 Sorry to hear this. Get CBD oil or capsules. Or a vaporizer, and some high quality cannabis if you can find some. It really does help quite a lot, especially the CBD. Sold online 100% legal
860 2018-05-30 22:25:19 I need to learn how to change the oil in my car because I can’t stand sitting around waiting for it to get done.

865 2018-05-30 22:24:50 Coincidentally Bush’s last year in office his oil buddies saw WINDFALL profits... And I remember Rush Limbaugh trying to convince people $140 per barrel for oil was good for the economy. They been spewing that garbage for years! Precisely why I quit listening to his show.
866 2018-05-30 22:24:47 They didn’t want the Keystone Pipeline to contaminate their country so they sold the deal to money-grabbing American oil magnates-destroying our aquifers, not theirs!
867 2018-05-30 22:24:46 No, gun lobby financed 40% by gun manufacturers. 5% of gun owners belong to the NRA. You don’t need to point out number of owners, or at least don’t assume all are for armalites. I’m not a dem, I possess a firearm, and think armalites are for punks. You don’t speak for all of us
868 2018-05-30 22:24:32 Review the TRAIN Law. Lower the VAT. Revisit VAT exemptions. Rollback oil excise on fuel. Increase more the tobacco excise tax.

872 2018-05-30 22:24:08 I was a swim instructor for years and I’m blonde. Tip that saved me: saturate your hair with coconut oil, get it wet with clean water from the shower, then put your swim cap on.
873 2018-05-30 22:23:45 i left my coconut oil too long in the microwave but you know what i dont care if it burns if i die i die
874 2018-05-30 22:23:38 @AmitShah sir by yesterday action of oil companies we Indians congratulate you for drop in one paise price of petrol Great
875 2018-05-30 22:23:30 The oil is separated from the sand before it is pumped down line, if it wasn't the pipe would be worn out in a few days and the pipe would also plug.
876 2018-05-30 22:23:19 Even if govt cuts tax from Petrol, It will have to adjust it somewhere else - Else the deficit will increase leading to higher inflation... So whichever way you want it, Global price rise of Oil can't be mitigated @sardesairajdeep by doing Politics...So please stop the Propaganda
877 2018-05-30 22:23:18 Nabdbdjsmaahk my period was a full week early and I feel SO weird like lightheaded and food all tastes like rancid oil (?) and I keep like dropping things am I dying

880 2018-05-30 22:22:58 Yeah. And if you get them super short, it works just as well. It literally creates a barrier between your teeth and skin. Lol  In the mean time, cutical oil or vitamin E oil will help you heal. GOOD LUCK! I know it’s hard :(

882 2018-05-30 22:22:54 Getting an oil change really takes two hours I hate it
883 2018-05-30 22:22:49 Oil and water don't mix
884 2018-05-30 22:22:47 it is freaking unhealthy. Too much oil in it
885 2018-05-30 22:22:46 Maybe he was tryna stay within the man means cause he gone buy him a bugatti then what? Man bout can’t even afford an oil change lol
886 2018-05-30 22:22:38 Oh bb I’m sorry, try 2 only use organic products on your skin and cetaphil will be great to clear that up. Just moisturize with natural products, coconut oil might even help!
887 2018-05-30 22:22:37 Me walking into HomeGoods: *you only need a picture frame. Only buy a picture frame.*

Me walking out of HomeGoods with my new diffuser, essential oil sampler, phone case, nail polish, stationary: Wow. I can’t believe I almost forgot I needed all of this.
888 2018-05-30 22:22:31 Not funny, ambien was definitely detrimental to the lives of several Women I know. They didn’t realize the side effects until I mentioned the mood swings they were enduring after having taken your snake oil. They stopped and all of them got better and felt better! #nomoreambien
889 2018-05-30 22:22:25 || hey guys if you use a binder a good natural recipe for a body spray to prevent body acne where it rests is 2 parts water, one part witch hazel  (or Apple cider vinegar) with a few drops of tea tree oil.
890 2018-05-30 22:22:04 Trim, roughly chop the fridge and a little oil.
891 2018-05-30 22:21:58 buying CBD oil before the dentist was probably the best decision i've made in my adult life

898 2018-05-30 22:21:14 Again, you are using angry rhetoric and mistruth to try and attack me. You are proving you cannot debate on the issue of oil without resorting to attacks and hypocritical bigotry. You are the #Troll here. #ConsCannotDebate #cdnpoli #StopKM

901 2018-05-30 22:20:41 I am also pretty sure they aren't frying their foods in Olive Oil xD
902 2018-05-30 22:20:28 @easyJet Hi, I would like to know if it's possible to transport a bottle of essential oil (Peppermint Oil) in the cabin ? Thank you
903 2018-05-30 22:20:18 I love @LayriteOfficial beard oil. Some of the best I’ve ever used.
904 2018-05-30 22:20:05 OMG *hugs* for future reference (and the sake of your poor wounded privates) wash your hands in vinegar or lemon juice. For a Reaper or Ghost Pepper I'd do this twice. THEN wash with soap and water. The burny culprit is an oil which has to be broken down before it will wash away
905 2018-05-30 22:20:00 the Missy Elliott "Work It" video highlighted Paladino's redevelopment of more oil and equitable economy. Read
906 2018-05-30 22:19:41 Just made a salad with leftover couscous, kalamata olives, feta, cucumber and olive oil. This’ll hold me over while I cook dinner. 
907 2018-05-30 22:19:36 Well, there weren't too many private companies that were dumb enough to embark on the oil sands projects, but they sure got in there after government money got it up and running.

911 2018-05-30 22:19:13 "The purpose was to dirty the Trump campaign."

Is that a paradox, like wetting water or lubricating oil?
912 2018-05-30 22:19:03 Snake oil salesman.   So awful there are so many gullible people.  
913 2018-05-30 22:18:50 Obama is Hawaiian. He speaks pidgin. HIs hometown is Oahu, where he attended a school that cost his stepfather, an oil executive $100K a year. He moved to Chicago when he was in his 30's after graduating from Harvard. He granted a LOT of $$$ to HI & Native Americans.
914 2018-05-30 22:18:40 David, I am SO sorry to hear about your father.  Having just gone through this with my mother-in-law, I can recommend  CBD oil. It eases anxiety, as well as some of the major side effects of the chemo. If it is unavailable in your area, please.let me know. I'll get it to you
915 2018-05-30 22:18:14 I’ve seen oil rigs turn quicker
916 2018-05-30 22:18:05 You two should Hot oil wrestle to see who gets him
917 2018-05-30 22:17:58 PSA peppermint oil works really well at repelling gnats (including biting gnats) but make sure that if you’re using it around a pet not to let them inhale it undiluted bc their lil noses are sensitive
918 2018-05-30 22:17:50 I tried with coconut oil and it didn’t work hes too chubb
919 2018-05-30 22:17:42 Wanda you’re so right. The west steals from the middle east. Ask Iraq how much of their oil they own now?

923 2018-05-30 22:17:10 Oil can, oil can
924 2018-05-30 22:17:02 I mean, why are we surprised? @BarackObama had @LeoDiCaprio advise him on oil and fuel issues? This isn’t a new tactic
925 2018-05-30 22:16:37 Having a bad day? Face mask. Having a bad day? Coconut oil. Having a bad day? Milkshake. #dayfixed
926 2018-05-30 22:16:36 Put vegetable oil around the boy boy and slide him right out
927 2018-05-30 22:16:31 Deterioration of family being part of violence problem? YES. Pornography as part of gun violence problem? NO! Awful as it is, this is just another politician snake oil salesman selling whiskey as a health tonic. They want to make a laws 2 give appearance of doing something
928 2018-05-30 22:16:30 Of course not, the Nixon-parody might get angry, find out we have oil and declare war on us despite the fact that we're white
929 2018-05-30 22:16:17 You're on about the one on the left right? I very much agree if so. Think he needs a bit of baby oil too! 
930 2018-05-30 22:16:06 A couple of different projects started off our week, first the crew traveled out to Davey, NE to install some tanker graphics for Otte Oil & Propane then back at the shop we put some graphics on Robbie Johnson’s micro sprint.
931 2018-05-30 22:16:02 I worked in the marketing end of big oil for my entire career and I'm here to tell you, the fossil fuel industry misrepresents the danger to the environment and life constantly.
932 2018-05-30 22:15:47 !!!! Try Jamaican black castor oil on your hair (focusing on your scalp) a lot of people swear it helps with hair growth and it might help you outgrow the bad hair cut!! (You can buy a bottle of it on Amazon for like 8-9 dollars I think)
933 2018-05-30 22:15:42 Lemon pepper salmon, avocado and cucumber/tomatoes w olive oil
934 2018-05-30 22:15:27 I use Organics. I mix maybe 4 pumps of conditioner with water in those travel-size spray bottles and spray every second day. Then I moisturize with glycerin or castor oil. Try using the water/conditioner mix on your cornrows under your wigs, water helps.
935 2018-05-30 22:15:24 Yes I agree. And what are you going to house these renewable resources in? How are you going to transport them. It's been 150 years of using oil based products, it's going to take 300 to ween off of them. Still waiting for you to give me an item not reliant on oil
936 2018-05-30 22:15:23 UK Parliament Treasury Select Committee held an investigation in July 2008 when oil was >$140/bbl. I was a witness & recommended a Transatlantic Commission of Inquiry by regulators into the Brent market. Then the price collapsed to $35/bbl by Dec 2008 & that was the end of that
937 2018-05-30 22:15:10 Too much “energy” stored up in the dollar to really want to be on the short side of oil.
938 2018-05-30 22:15:07 Because of your incompetant and useless petrominister who is scared to take action on oil companies who insulted the nation by 1 paise dip Bjp lost at least 2% votes

941 2018-05-30 22:14:29  jus more real reasons to keep believing the hype!  yes hey oil ur at $100 ??? now
942 2018-05-30 22:14:18 Rub any natural oil continuously......it seals the ink even if you itch it.
943 2018-05-30 22:14:05 I assume that people who are vegan for the animals/environment don’t buy any clothes? The fashion industry causes far more environmental damage and harm to animals and eco systems than anything but the oil industry
944 2018-05-30 22:14:04 Well, I am not a great supporter of the pipeline from the point of view of getting off oil, but I also don't see the Liberals had much choice given their commitment to build it. I would like to see much greater emphasis on alternative energies and building a new economy.
945 2018-05-30 22:14:04 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
946 2018-05-30 22:13:59 avocados are damn near perfect and anyone who says otherwise got me bent. Plus, you ever used avocado oil? A high smoke point so it can be used for frying without being so chemically processed like canola oil. Bad. Ass.
947 2018-05-30 22:13:40 Because we were busy eating our future away. We're u in mars? Oil price was $110 to $140 for 5yrs . We cld afford anything ,subsidized anything. Rice came in through our boarders, government was nt intrested in curbing smuggling or revenue frm customs ,crude oil sales was enough
948 2018-05-30 22:13:37 I am so very sorry.  If you don't live in a cannabis-legal state, it still may be worth your while traveling to one.  People with cancer often like to take a concentrate known as RSO (for Rick Simpson's Oil -- google it). Have a quiver of those on hand for your dad.

956 2018-05-30 22:12:22 Oil and coal belong to the past. Perhaps you've heard of renewable sources of energy? That is what is needed now.

958 2018-05-30 22:12:15 I had to think back about Queen Sugar because I was so confused about how Hollywood and Aunt Vi ended up in Italy. I totally forgot Hollywood got that settlement from the oil rig explosion. #QueenSugar #GimmeSugar
959 2018-05-30 22:12:05 Check the label. "High-oleic" sunflower oil is low PUFA, high MUFA, is decent for stuff like homemade mayo. Avoid all others.
960 2018-05-30 22:11:58 Supply and demand - repubs love those oil companies and their lobbyists love them back! Keep pushing your head into the sand if you honestly think having Republicans in control of federal govt has nothing to do with these prices!
961 2018-05-30 22:11:46 It would be nice if the world could run on solar/Wind/tidal/geothermal/etc but we’re not there yet. In the meantime that oil needs to get to market. Let’s get it built ASAP
962 2018-05-30 22:11:45 /rlt/ ada yang pernah pake bio oil? Menurut kalian worth it ga?
963 2018-05-30 22:11:45 Must be like an oil slick in your gob mate lol 
964 2018-05-30 22:11:41 Not Dinosaur fossils no fossils have never been found on a oil rig.Dinosaur fossils are a hoax like evolution.
965 2018-05-30 22:11:34 If it wasent for Alberta oil what would drive the Canadien economy...BC protesters? Lets see it this way...Clean Alberta soil..export the oil and boost the Canadien economy to build renewable hydro powerplans...
966 2018-05-30 22:11:33 If that’s the case why isn’t a) snp shouting about it daily? b) not mentioned in growth report? In any case oil revenues low. If price of oil gets much higher US will simply start up their shale oil fields again as cheaper to produce.
967 2018-05-30 22:11:06 The synthesis is that we likely have more to clean up from the past than oil & gas. But the alternatives - telecommuting, etc - seem to defy human nature, where interactions --> bonds --> hires. Location still matters. /fin

973 2018-05-30 22:10:25 Exactly always research what you’re putting in your body, we treat our cars with more respect by making sure only the right fuel goes in and oil and etc is replaced so I don’t get why people throw whatever inside them
974 2018-05-30 22:10:21 This is the internet we are talking about.
The community evolves the same way that deep frier oil congeals into irremovable gunk.

978 2018-05-30 22:09:58 Is this the namechange from Dr Feelgood to Snake Oil due to the medical symbol controversy with the LCBO? It's the same beer?
979 2018-05-30 22:09:55 This is how you end up covered in engine oil, parts everywhere staring confused at why the steering wheel is lodged in the ceiling.
980 2018-05-30 22:09:50 No, but you don't have to tell. Your dad is more important. Try to get RSO - high THC, and get as much as you can. There's also CBD  oil but you don't want that - it's the high THC oil that is recommended for cancer. Best of luck to you and your dad.

986 2018-05-30 22:09:14 Oil price feel,Nigeria,South Africa ,Saudi Arabia and Norway all went into recession in 2015/2016,but impact not much on Saudi and Norway because they funded budget by borrowing from $750b to $600b SWF to absolve the shock and stabilized their economies. We had less than $2b
987 2018-05-30 22:09:11 Again, you are using angry rhetoric with no proof or evidence to back u your claims. Just proves you cannot accept other people's opinions and you want Canada to be held back by oil. pathetic. #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
988 2018-05-30 22:09:08 This half term shit has really thrown me off like EVERYTHING school related.

2+5? 15
fractional distillation? put oil in fire
microwaves n radiowaves? Beans n Reggie Yates innit

me: "I know everything anyway, no point in revising"
989 2018-05-30 22:08:45 I am here for the engine oil tweet,
There's only one way to oil an engine like a real engine not a metaphoric engine, if you had oil any other way to won't work and that is through the designed allowance oil for adding oil
990 2018-05-30 22:08:39 I’m not sure we are all qualified to assess full implications of this deal for the Canadian oil market...Or for the overall national economic interest , jobs and most importantly the final negotiations onNAFTA

I believe the latter drove much of the impetus to get this deal done

992 2018-05-30 22:08:31 Except that "terminally ill having the right to try experimental drugs" can, if implemented poorly, turn into "snake oil salesmen having the right to prey on desperate people".

Does this law consider this?
993 2018-05-30 22:08:29 Does this mean the Alberta Government can no longer "turn off the taps?" Now that the feds own it, can they force Alberta to export oil to BC?
994 2018-05-30 22:08:26 Have you tried a room humidifier in your room? That will help bring up the humidity level in the air. I also recommend a facial oil under your moisturizer. Clarins and philosophy have good ones.
995 2018-05-30 22:08:25 Populous,protectionest govt. alike Trump,dangerous 
US, World economies peaked already, especially Canadian
Oil price may stay between $40/$60 range
Canadian dollar below 0.75 to US
Trade war,Trump affect,inflation even higher
Intt. heading higher for sure
Real estate bubble,risk
996 2018-05-30 22:08:24 Yeah we claimed it I guess. Makes perfect sense for Norway to have lands in antarctica  We claimed it in 1927. In 2008 we also petitioned the UN for a claim on about 540k square kilometers of surrounding ocean. I’m guessing there’s a possibility of oil then? 
997 2018-05-30 22:08:23 Nope, a seed oil.
998 2018-05-30 22:08:18 I should have just left my hair natural. It's so damaged. I have to soak it in coconut oil all the time.
999 2018-05-30 22:08:16 A slight blow against your Davy oil lamp will extinguish it, and to light it again you will have to find a place where there is no fire damp. Take a long time looking for the place.
1000 2018-05-30 22:08:13 And $27.99 is still a great deal for oil filter and tire rotation. Just not a coool way to get there @bigotires
1001 2018-05-30 22:08:12 Giving up even more food from today - chocolate, soya and palm oil 
(Not edamame beans tho) 
- avoiding gluten as much as possible
1002 2018-05-30 22:08:10 I appreciate your social media outreach efforts but I have two free oil changes.
1003 2018-05-30 22:08:02 Lol it becomes a vicious cycle, you strip off the oil so your face produces more to replace it and each time you strip it, it’ll keep making MOOOORRRREE oil. 
1004 2018-05-30 22:07:50 Best win was against Bama in 12. That’s about all their Hundred Dollar a Barrel of Oil & Johnny Football has got them. In that time they have been passed again by Texas, almost passed by TCU if not & almost passed by Baylor.
1005 2018-05-30 22:07:35 A mix of castor oil and rose hip oil, takes care of acne and dark spots, and is an amazing moisturizer
1006 2018-05-30 22:07:29 Yeah concepts like free healthcare, college, and lowering homicide rates through gun control sure sound selfish and greedy to me. Meanwhile, how much are Trump and his buddies profiting from his tax bill? How much has oil gone up, and what company was Rex Tillerson CEO of?
1007 2018-05-30 22:07:24 Pretty sure oil workers wouldn't mind having jobs in #RenewableEnergy as long as they get paid and it would be jobs for them. Immigration is good for the economy, pity Conservatives want to reduce immigration to Canada. #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #KeepItInTheGround
1008 2018-05-30 22:07:14 Finally giving Fiona the oil change she deserves and needs.  #takingcareofmybaby #subielove #shealwaysgetsmefrompointAtoB
1009 2018-05-30 22:07:05 Ya man weed is the way and you get a tasty buzz too why don’t you pot heads get behind non psychoactive cbd oil maybe because it doesn’t get you high while having all the positive benefits just say you want to smoke pot it doesn’t cure anything but it definitely is helpful
1010 2018-05-30 22:07:02 Think you’ll get the show in tonight?
1011 2018-05-30 22:06:50 @1petermartin In 2007-08 banks lent money for housing in oil dependent US suburbia. That caused the financial crisis. Australia is very vulnerable to oil price shock. Completely ignored by @ScottMorrisonMP. @LucyTurnbullGSC makes everything worse with her endless #Sydney growth
1012 2018-05-30 22:06:49 You might want to next time ask them to not put anything after waxing. My lady puts baby powder on now and that’s fine. A lot of times the lotion/oil is clogging the pores which causes a breakout. Whereas baby powder isn’t oil based so won’t close pores
1013 2018-05-30 22:06:47 The #OPEC, #Russia output boost talk didn't keep US #retail #gasoline price from rising 3.9 cents in the week w/#MemorialDayWeekend, $2.962 a gallon & +55.6 cents vs year ago. See how leisurely retail avg price recedes (if at all) on prospect of more crude. #OOTT #oil #energy
1014 2018-05-30 22:06:24 Research sources for Rick Simpson oil, privately produced
1015 2018-05-30 22:06:19 They lie together, oil on water
1016 2018-05-30 22:05:54 Getting an oil change. I ask for high mileage oil. 
Mechanic: “How many miles on there?”
Me: “263,950.”
Mechanic: (pause) “How many was that again?” 
@Toyota #Yaris  AF - what can I say?
1017 2018-05-30 22:05:43 I usually break out when I get them done. Come to find out it’s from the oil/lotion they put on after waxing. Typically they swab alcohol then wax then something after and whatever that product is makes me breakout.
1018 2018-05-30 22:05:39 Thank you for the video, especially the oil?
1019 2018-05-30 22:05:34 This might be all the weed oil i vaped in my car  before i came in here talking, but everyone in this grocery store looks like they know what meth tastes like.
1020 2018-05-30 22:05:30 Plus a line exist already. We do not need 2A changes to move the line, you know this. It is why you don’t have biological weapons or a Apache helicopter. There is a line and the 2A is still in tact. You guys are approaching this all wrong, JMO. Not negotiating is bad strategy IMO
1021 2018-05-30 22:05:13 Don't use dryer sheets! Put a few essential oil drops on a wash cloth & throw it in w/your clothes. No chemicals!
1022 2018-05-30 22:05:09 Don't use dryer sheets! Put a few essential oil drops on a wash cloth & throw it in w/your clothes. No chemicals!
1023 2018-05-30 22:04:40 Off the wall thought: have you noticed how plastic attracts oil? Check your washing up. So could your idea be extended to oil slicks? Dump some form of plastic in the slick then remove the plastic plus oil with your system. Feasible practical affordable or just a stupid idea?
1024 2018-05-30 22:04:29 Use peppermint oil mix with water in a spray bottle,  add a few drops of dish washing detergent
1025 2018-05-30 22:04:29 Likely true and both have spills as well. The main emissions issue is increasing oil sands production. Can't cost-effectively act on climate by making the problem worse
1026 2018-05-30 22:04:10 Puts tanning oil on. Sits in sun for couple hours. Burnt is an understatement.

1028 2018-05-30 22:04:02 Anybody using/taking black cumin seed oil? 
How are you using it?
Have you noticed the benefits?
1029 2018-05-30 22:04:00 *me as a greek*

Friend: try this its mad good

“Ehhh”

Friend: cmonn its got lemon on it

“Lemon?, ehh maybe”

Friend: and olive oil

“Oooooo doesn’t sound bad”

Friend: oregano too

“Wtf pass that shit my mans what u waiting for”
1030 2018-05-30 22:03:56 Remember, a daily average of about 391.40 million gallons (or about 9.32 million barrels per day). gasoline a day is what runs America. $.01 rise in price means $3.9mm/day out of the economy and in the pockets of the oil companies.
1031 2018-05-30 22:03:54 We had a kitten do that years ago with a piece of steel pipe. Had to slick him up with corn oil and slowly pull skin around the pipe until he popped out. He was know as Pipe Head for quite a while then name shortened to Piper. He was a orange cat too. hhhmmmm?
1032 2018-05-30 22:03:49 Having a car so expensive !!! I need new tires my shits bald af and I need an oil change

1042 2018-05-30 22:03:09 São movidas a eletricidade. A geração da mesma pode vir a carvão e gás? Sim, pode. Mas também pode vir de usinas solares, eólicas entre outras. Ao contrário dos carros a “oil”. Com o baratear das energias renováveis significa que cada elétrico implica em melhor consumo futuro.
1043 2018-05-30 22:03:08 Many other oil producers had the same issue, none is in Venezuela’s condition.
1044 2018-05-30 22:03:06 We need to stop the narrative that HTX didn't make the list because we weren't good enough. Amazon 1) didn't want to compete with energy companies for talent, esp. if oil spikes, and 2) didn't want to be seen squeezing Houston for incentives while recovering after Harvey.
1045 2018-05-30 22:02:55 Buying the oil tomorrow. They can name their price

Me: Nah I’m good, just let me get an oil change...
1051 2018-05-30 22:02:24 HELLOOOOOOO !!! It’s the dumb fucks that have never paid $250 for an oil change on a luxury vehicle with the most to say .

1058 2018-05-30 22:01:39 With the oil price (RON95) set to be fixed, how does one construct and execute an arbitrage strategy  the obvious one would be to smuggle it to Thailand. The legal one would be... Hmm maybe long fuel-related service and short crude oil?

1065 2018-05-30 22:01:01 Essential Oil Fact: Lemongrass eases aches and pains. Diluted in a blend, a lemongrass massage strengthens muscle tone and slack tissues, ideal for a pre-sports massage or to treat aching muscles. Also great for headache relief.

1074 2018-05-30 22:00:18 They certainly shouldn't be left to their own devices. And it's oil companies own fault they have bad PR. They continued the secretive corporate culture while activists filled that information void with their own narrative. By the time they tried it looked like greenwashing.

1085 2018-05-30 21:58:24 #pnpcbc This is an issue over long term issues such as climate change versus short term interests such as oil revenues. It is not a partisan issue at its heart unless you attribute the short term to conservatives and long term to NDP with the Libs in the middle trying to do both

1088 2018-05-30 21:58:08 Just read an article on how to hand make pasta. Sweet! Then the author concluded suggesting you should boil the pasta with oil and pepper. Fake news, sad!! Who the fuck boils pepper?
1089 2018-05-30 21:58:08 That didn't effect the rest of the world? What??why did we invade Iraq and why are we invading Syria? Why is saudia Arabia are allies? It's not because they share the same values. Lol everything is based in oil.
1090 2018-05-30 21:58:02 Damn that sounds traumatic. I hope you find something to help. I heard Castor Oil on your roots help but I haven’t tried it
1091 2018-05-30 21:57:58 Jesus is coming soon  For his bride  Prepare and fill your Oil lamp We know not the day or hour, not even the Angels we know the season Are you ready for Jesus return  Love you all 
1092 2018-05-30 21:57:52 Oil is very important kirk

1094 2018-05-30 21:57:46 How do I go about getting myself a summer intern, like one that I don’t have to pay, but they’ll do things like take my car for an oil change, do my laundry, grocery shopping, go to work for me, exercise for me, live for me...
1095 2018-05-30 21:57:45 ergh i could imagine the fucking facial oil running on squizxy's face as pyro kisses her
1096 2018-05-30 21:57:35 Getting hot oil popped on u while u have a sunburn is horrible 
1097 2018-05-30 21:57:23 I just find it funny how the coasts have the highest gas prices when that’s where they’re sourcing the oil from. Doesn’t make sense how LA gas is $4 but it’s $2 in the middle of Kansas
1098 2018-05-30 21:57:21 Not for heavy oil.
1099 2018-05-30 21:57:15 Texas A&M Director of Athletics Scott Woodward with a great line about the Aggies success since joining the SEC.

1101 2018-05-30 21:57:03 lol y’all get so butthurt about any sort of criticism of your snake oil industry
1102 2018-05-30 21:56:52 Me: I’m so independent. Ready to be on my own. Parents need to leave me alone.

Also me: Requests $28 from dad for an oil and filter change. 
1103 2018-05-30 21:56:50 Do you realize but for Peter Lougheed’s massive investment of taxpayer money in the original tar sands project, the Alberta oil sands would not exist they say now do or Mulrooney’s subsidization of Hibernia, etc.
1104 2018-05-30 21:56:42 What kind of fucked up people try to check a flight attendant’s oil?

#MeToo
1105 2018-05-30 21:56:40 Oil can boost economies, but it can drag them down too.  Also, illegal immigration has nothing to do with oil. Corporations the wealthy should be taxed more BTW. #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
1106 2018-05-30 21:56:35 Forego the expensive pills and killer chemo and get your hands on some some quality cannabis oil.
Taken properly, Cannabis CURES cancer!
Apoptosis is the chemical process in which THC/CBD instructs cancer cells to die without any harm to healthy cells.
1107 2018-05-30 21:56:30 I’m @bigotires for service. I have a coupon for $17.99 oil filter and rotation. Total is $27.99. How about companies be transparent up front instead of piling on additional fees? Customer lost. #CustomerExperience #fail
1108 2018-05-30 21:56:30 I'll answer that one. NO, he can't. Because that weapon does not exist. Unless you can pull a trigger 600 times in a minute, AND remove each empty magazine, AND replace it with a full one, AND recycle the action each time you do so.
1109 2018-05-30 21:56:14 Coolade ain't quenching the thirst. You need something strong.

Like crude oil.
1110 2018-05-30 21:56:00 For lunch I had a spinach salad with orange peppers and cucumbers topped off with olive oil and almonds
1111 2018-05-30 21:55:55 I guess she wanted to test the olive oil (Goya) she received from the prophet of the most high
1112 2018-05-30 21:55:54 Markets didn't react sharply to pulling the Iran Deal for nothing. If you want to put the brakes on a growing economy, just raise the cost of oil. Goes like this.

Oil
Gas
All Costs
Disposable Income
Economy
Probability of Recession

Trump has no clue what he's doing.
1113 2018-05-30 21:55:38 Eastern Canada has the refineries.  If we had a national energy plan they would sell their oil to the East.  Replacing imports.
1114 2018-05-30 21:55:28 Someone did this to me and the only things they got were vitamins and rosehip oil. They were disappointed af. 
1115 2018-05-30 21:55:25 What is new is oil money bringing Uighurs and other Muslim Xinjiang people to Saudi to get educated in wahabbist doctrine. And Uighur participation in IS is likely bc of this
1116 2018-05-30 21:55:21 #PetrolPrice wait for next state election in MP,  oil prices may come down or prices will be freezer..
1117 2018-05-30 21:55:18 We blame Ray J for giving Kim Kardashian the nerve, the audacity to claim celebrity status.

That sextape should have stayed on the camera.

It’s like Moesha meeting Nana Addo to discuss oil & gas reforms.
1118 2018-05-30 21:55:14  get the Castor oil my girlll
1119 2018-05-30 21:55:07 Dizzies came back this past weekend.  Sucks but it’s part of life now.  With it come headaches too and the unsettled weather doesn’t help at all.  Doing just an oil change last night I was pulling to one side when I’d get up from under the car, have to steady myself.  Ugh.
1120 2018-05-30 21:55:00 Hellman's is trying to move in on Cupie is all this is about. 

As an aside, I had a stalker from Soma, Fukushima.

And, mayo is eggs, vegetable oil, vinegar and salt. I make my own, for other things, sushi deserves wasabi and soy sauce. Everything else is a lie.
1121 2018-05-30 21:54:58 “.In case anyone wondered, this is how the world ends: with the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world going fully in the tank for the oil industry.” @billmckibben talking about @JustinTrudeau re #KinderMorgan in @theguardiannews

1123 2018-05-30 21:54:38 ....I have had bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar for lunch/breakfast for like uh, a week running? So um. Probably.
1124 2018-05-30 21:54:37 Changes to make that happen were done, but there is no way we can change it again? Ha ha now that is funny. “Women will never get the vote”
1125 2018-05-30 21:54:28 I know that anybody with there oil on these days need there head checked
1126 2018-05-30 21:54:27 Works all year through. It was my staple. Mix it with a little baby oil and your life will change for ever. And your skin will love you all the more!!!
1127 2018-05-30 21:54:25 Why don’t they ask us for oil.
1128 2018-05-30 21:54:13 Jesus is coming soon  Return for his bride Are your oil lamps full? Word of God, Holy BIBLE  The sword is our Weapon  Holy Bible  Prepare Saints  Jesus is coming soon  Armour UP suit up 
1129 2018-05-30 21:54:10 A&M AD Scott Woodward, telling @finebaum about what A&M's first year in the SEC felt like: "It was like lightning in a bottle. You always joke about it — $100 oil, Johnny Football and the SEC."
1130 2018-05-30 21:53:58 Oil extracted from Scotland, fish  , whisky all that shall not be domestic for Ruth D's as she is  working to get WM jobs #Indyref2
1131 2018-05-30 21:53:56 They see their own prosperity as dependent on the oil industry -- fall into the trap of believing what's convenient for continuing on essentially the same as before.
(Plus a lot of not entirely rational hate for Trudeau Sr & his energy policies -- also fomented by the oil lobby.)
1132 2018-05-30 21:53:42 To oil control or to exfoliate is the question .... my face needs a good face mask
1133 2018-05-30 21:53:41 Why does this oil pen taste like curry....?
1134 2018-05-30 21:53:40 i mixed an essential oil blend and brought my diffuser to work today and it really helped my mood all day. i was feeling mad cranky this morning.
1135 2018-05-30 21:53:30 Wow, you just saved the world! Now, lets burn a couple of tonnes of oil to catch up!!
1136 2018-05-30 21:53:26 you wanna change my oil, girl? 
1137 2018-05-30 21:53:25 #pnpcbc Jen, that is total hogwash. The issue was around BC and climate change and AB and landlocked oil. No party up until this point has successfully overcome this difference. It has nothing to do with Trudeau's politics that has set the project back.
1138 2018-05-30 21:53:20 Burning the midnight oil again, well done you are brilliant as usual. #SaveLucifer #PickUpLucifer
1139 2018-05-30 21:53:14 I'm with you.  I saw reruns all of the time.
1140 2018-05-30 21:52:57 sounds like it's carte blanche for every charlatan and quack to entice the most desperate of us to fork over their last dollars in a futile attempt at survival.  Hard to believe that the POTUS would be on the side of snake oil salesmen.
1141 2018-05-30 21:52:55 MY COUNTRY ACCENT IS NEVER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN WHEN DEALING WITH THESE OIL AND GAS FOLKS
1142 2018-05-30 21:52:52 I really amazed how US gasoline at gas station changed prices speedily pigging backward up to oil WTI price .. which tools or systems or digitally that is used to make it real time step changes!
1143 2018-05-30 21:52:51 Oil spill? What oil spill?
1144 2018-05-30 21:52:51 What about the opportunity lost by Oil majors, spare parts sellers and what not.Modi should definitely own up & resign.
1145 2018-05-30 21:52:48 Forever sad that apparently no one uploaded 110's Gothic Lolita attacks, I wanted to see what Chorozade was about to do to the Oil Magnate and Ichi kicking Gastami's ass!
1146 2018-05-30 21:52:46 Purcgase it illegally; or from a nearby state. Pain clinics can sometimes offer edibles or CBC oil; check them out
1147 2018-05-30 21:52:23 This is what My Cannabis oil is doing to Stage 4-5 Prostate Cancer for someone I can't mention right now. Test results Don't Lie.

My tumor on my left hip went from 10 cm down to 9. Right hip from 9 cm to 8cm!
Less lymph nodes involved now....
1148 2018-05-30 21:52:19 France never supported biafra in the beginning. France only started showing interest and support,  when it learned that millions of children were being starved to death  by Britain and Nigeria, for the purpose of maintaining Britains grip on biafran oil.
1149 2018-05-30 21:52:09 Can he try CBD oil? or...the corner in Baltimore (Im kidding, but when our poor healthcare leaves you no options... you do what you have to)
1150 2018-05-30 21:52:02 there are lots of parts of CA that look like parts of Italy in terms of geography, also we make wine and olive oil
1151 2018-05-30 21:52:01 Trudeau 2017,”Let’s phase out oil”.Trudeau 2018 “Let’s buy a pipeline”.What a paradigm shift!
1152 2018-05-30 21:52:00 The Nanny was hawt!
1153 2018-05-30 21:51:54 When the oil and gas royalties amount to less revenue than the alcohol tax and gambling revenues, there is really much benefit to pumping more and more.
1154 2018-05-30 21:51:52 I don’t believe in God because God doesn’t believe in me! Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, a philosopher stone, and an iMac! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1155 2018-05-30 21:51:49 /rlt/ Numpang tanya dong.. Kalo ada pertanyaan: "The factory ___ an estimate of 2000 barrels of oil each month" Itu jawabannya product bukan...?

And honestly I’m so happy
1160 2018-05-30 21:51:15 What a joke ? Is Kanye being proposed for consultations on oil drilling on national monuments?
1161 2018-05-30 21:50:45 I remember YOU Sen. Cantwell, saying that you would "Get to the Bottom of over-inflated Gas prices and Oil Industry price fixing" - 10 YEARS AGO !!!
Maybe it's time to Get off yer duff and finally get on that one.
1162 2018-05-30 21:50:41 Pipelines have no impact on climate change. Demand for oil based products drives carbon emissions. Pipeline fights are a sideshow distracting far too much human energy from the much more critical job of developing alternatives to oil sooner than later.
1163 2018-05-30 21:50:32 #omg the MCT oil fkd me up!!! #ketodiet
1164 2018-05-30 21:50:18 Just cleaned the F-250 and my Oakley oil riggers. New Castle Roadhouse is NOT ready for me tonight.

1166 2018-05-30 21:50:10 ooo I do that in the mornings. Add MCT oil to your coffee. Helps curve cravings.
1167 2018-05-30 21:50:09 I'm at Walmart getting my oil changed and I have 2% left but I'm on here cause I got nothing better to do
1168 2018-05-30 21:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1169 2018-05-30 21:50:01 My grandma went to the car dealership to get her oil changed and came out with a brand new 2018 car. When can I have her life????
1170 2018-05-30 21:49:56 Calorie counting’s made me really aware of everything I put in my mouth. If someone were to ask me how much calories there are in one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, I could tell them.
1171 2018-05-30 21:49:48 @JustinTrudeau  I've been a life long Liberal (Federally) and you just lost my vote.  Btwn this massive Taxpayer bailout to a foreign oil company and your decimation of HIV/Harm reduction funding in Lower mainland I can no longer count on my vote. Hope it was worth it! #cndpoli

1174 2018-05-30 21:49:21 ...for insomnia, I choose a cbd/thc mix. For me, a 1:1 thc:cbd ratio oil works wonders for my own sleep challenges.
1175 2018-05-30 21:49:20 I put too much oil on my hair and now my glasses won’t stay on my face
1176 2018-05-30 21:49:14 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1177 2018-05-30 21:49:09 Rather than shipping the oil overseas, how about you build refineries in BC and create jobs here and sell the gas back to Canadians at a reduced price? No? Ok. Lets endanger the coastline and the fabric of what makes BC what it is...
1178 2018-05-30 21:48:56 Ran out of oil there but its not my fault i need one more to finish tunisia and Croatia and get the rest of the book filled
1179 2018-05-30 21:48:43 Responsibility its going to be tje oil of tje next decade. So no real problem with our nations wealth,if you take off your UK centric specs for a second you can see this.

1183 2018-05-30 21:48:22 I would take your opinion about KM seriously if you didn't insist on referring to as an oil pipeline. It's not. Either you are aware of that fact and don't care, don't think it matters or you are not aware of it. Any of those alternatives prompt me to dismiss your opinion.
1184 2018-05-30 21:48:21 The Crude Oil spillage Clean up project by Hydro Carbon Remediation Project and Private sector partnership in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is highly commendable. Further Crude oil spillage can be averted or reduced by the Oil Companies, Public Agencies and the Communities.
1185 2018-05-30 21:48:12 Common sense in all made up by Big Sugar. Did the cavemen have common sense? Of course they didn't, they ate avocados dipped in coconut oil.

1187 2018-05-30 21:47:36 Thomas Mulclair claimed that harper building a strong oil economy was destroying Ontario's manufacturing, as opposed to bad prov. Government policies in like 2012 or 13. Time has since proven him wrong
1188 2018-05-30 21:47:35 For a moment his gaze lingered on her naked form, then tugged a rag out of his pocket and a tiny vial and started to coat his blade with an oil. The witcher's hand moved along the blade slowly, reverently, as though he was caressing the —
1189 2018-05-30 21:47:23 It's actually not good news.  It muddies the waters around good science vs snake oil salesman.
1190 2018-05-30 21:47:05 We had a ban that stood for what 15 years? Enough with the we the people can’t change things. This is why gun ownership mirrors our slavery experience. One side profits from way it is, the other just knows it’s wrong. Your obstruction will be gun owners demise IMO
1191 2018-05-30 21:47:04 While others groan, you will grow & like Asher dip ur feet in oil for grace & prosperity. Ur feet shall be as iron to crush Satan's head

They're draining out the essence of my soil through a pipeline
So more like a flood going toxic from the start

Where is the justice here?
They're just profiteers

1205 2018-05-30 21:45:59 I will keep this in mind the next time I'm in a metabolic ward and have the option of being force fed corn oil or palm oil.
1206 2018-05-30 21:45:56 Trump and Truth on the same line  
just like oil and water 
does not mix well at all
1207 2018-05-30 21:45:47 Right all he will need to do is keep up with oil changes and regular maintenance and this car will last for a very long time
1208 2018-05-30 21:45:42 Actually Daryl the pipeline is extremely lucrative and access to foreign markets for our oil will provide huge returns on that investment not just to taxpayer but the larger economy as a whole. It's a wise investment and a profitable one.
1209 2018-05-30 21:45:19 Loving to bash Canadian fossil fuels but a gluten for America oil & profits! Remember only Canadian oil pollutes.
1210 2018-05-30 21:44:52 Theory is that a strong oilpatch based ecomony increases wages and inflation to a point that manufacturing/value added goods become less competitive. Based on netherlands manufacturing before and after north sea oil development.
1211 2018-05-30 21:44:47 As it says above, the choice between having an oil patch and a planet for my grandchildren, I'll chose the latter.
1212 2018-05-30 21:44:47 The hotel caters to businessmen who work in oil and mining up in Kazakhstan.  Being the only American there wasn't unusual.

1214 2018-05-30 21:44:32 We gotta go invade a country for some oil or something. Diesel prices are outta hand
1215 2018-05-30 21:44:28 Thought same after seeing the movie!! Our oil should have been our vibranium........greed and corruption won't let us shine!kai
1216 2018-05-30 21:44:23 From the divine Olive Tree of God, which is God Himself, in which God anoints him or her with the "Oil of God" into their lives, which by all standards if the "christening" of deity, for the ancient Kings of this world were anointed with "anointing oil" as a personal christening!
1217 2018-05-30 21:44:21 'Bringing our oil to saltwater'. Now it's sounding like a pasta recipe.
1218 2018-05-30 21:44:17 Because a calorie is not a calorie. A calorie of sugar and a calorie of coconut oil have a completely different calorific value. Like durrr! You’re welcome. #Pioppi

1224 2018-05-30 21:43:39 I hate coming to get an oil change
1225 2018-05-30 21:43:38 Ha - my daughter came home from College and I changed the oil in her Rav 4.  So I feel your pain brother
1226 2018-05-30 21:43:32 Don’t stop squeaking until you get the oil! We have a plan that will solve many homicides in the @CityOfBoston  “Sadly, they don’t want to listen!”
1227 2018-05-30 21:43:27 $SPY 100% cash overnight; no resolution on trade, Italy or oil plus middle east and Venezuela tensions; like 70 area on an intraday buy tmrw or an oversold level maybe 71; shorting >76
1228 2018-05-30 21:43:10 Tony Seba (who hasn't been wrong yet): "All oil infrastructure will be stranded assets before 2030. "
1229 2018-05-30 21:43:06 ?No. It worked. Solved toddlers killing themselves. Solved someone else using your gun to kill themselves. NRA was NOT against it because of a circuit board failing. I know electronics, 35yrs EE. It deserved praise and funding from NRA instead they shit on it with smear campaign
1230 2018-05-30 21:43:02 And a weak one at that.
1231 2018-05-30 21:42:52 I’m sorry. I never knew you were deaf. 
1232 2018-05-30 21:42:48 once i get sunkissed by the greek sun and im ingesting nothing but olive oil and feta cheese for 6 weeks straight its OVER for you hoes! im gonna develop fucking telepathy or something!

1234 2018-05-30 21:42:22 Droop's condition is clearly life-threatening. Ask anyone who has endured him in New York for the past 40 years.  

However, he had to say "or even cure their condition".  Snake oil. And there are people with life-threatening situations.

Droop has no empathy. He only has anger.
1235 2018-05-30 21:42:22 Religious" followers of the apostate satanic Luciferian devil's Christian false religion of Satan!  Amen.   And to repeat, there is a "spiritual evolution" to one's conviction of belief in God to the point where God anoints one with the anointing "Oil of God", that which derives
1236 2018-05-30 21:42:16 I hate BHO my skin is breaking out smh I am going back to being a oil snob lol I need Fresh Rosin or Co2 ! My skin is to Prescious for toxins ijs
1237 2018-05-30 21:42:14 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1238 2018-05-30 21:42:11 Strawman much? Gun ownership is nothing like slavery and you know it. Try debating with substance rather than emotionally charged logical fallacies.
1239 2018-05-30 21:42:03 BRB gotta go make our cartoon faces into buttons now :D untapped branding oil right there
1240 2018-05-30 21:42:01 -Guaranteed Social safetynets (healthcare, education, worker and consumer protections)

-End to capital driven foreign interference (oil wars, endless war on terror)

K done! In all seriousness, that's just barely scratching the surface but would go miles to modernizing the US
1241 2018-05-30 21:41:59 I'm so sorry my country is engaged in economic warfare against Venezuela. We're killing people mainly over the control of oil.
What else is new?
1242 2018-05-30 21:41:53 Any one who spends a week or two in Kalapani Cellular jail extracting veg oil pulling wooden oil mills, would beg for mercy from aliens. Do don’t be judgemental or comment about a person who was sentenced for 27 year Kalapani.
1243 2018-05-30 21:41:53 So why did you checkout with  “Andrew” in the 80’s when all was rosy as you painted it. I can recollect that Naira was said to be overvalued as Nigeria was producing nothing and importing most things other than crude oil.
1244 2018-05-30 21:41:45 Let the Arabs in Egypt give them a link to the Aswan dam for water. And let the Gulf states give em their oil if they want fuel.
1245 2018-05-30 21:41:37 The blend is called FLOOM. 5 drops Frankincense, 8 drops Lemon, 5 drops of On Guard, 5 drops of Oregano, 5 drops of Melalueca (tea tree). Put in roller bottle then use remaining space to add fractionated coconut oil. I hope this helps. :D
1246 2018-05-30 21:41:30 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1247 2018-05-30 21:41:30 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1248 2018-05-30 21:41:16 Chestnut oil or pure chestnuts. Spiders hate them x
1249 2018-05-30 21:41:15 Wow you’re really against the oil patch eh? Jealousy much? @jdphils check out this petty little man from, surprisingly, Canada. You’d think Canadians would care more about others but nope
1250 2018-05-30 21:40:44 Britain was only interested in maintaining it's grip on the oil in eastern Nigeria,  and they did everything to achieve their aim,  including killing and starving women and children.
1251 2018-05-30 21:40:40 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
1252 2018-05-30 21:40:37 I realize there is no room in B.C.  pristine waters for oil because of all the raw sewage dumped in them.
1253 2018-05-30 21:40:35 have you tried CBD oil before?
1254 2018-05-30 21:40:33 I guess you support open boarders  and illegals jumping across the boarder. Ask yourself who’s paying for it I’m already taxed to death , we need oil revenues to survive.
1255 2018-05-30 21:40:30 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1256 2018-05-30 21:40:25 Man, solar and wind could power everything pretty much forever. We only don't do it because oil.
1257 2018-05-30 21:40:22 Olive Oil, skinny bitches can’t get in the ride at all! #Weezy
1258 2018-05-30 21:40:21 Hahaha is the crude oil for drinking??  Well you should be easy to spot with all that protection. So I’ll grab you lads a beer.
1259 2018-05-30 21:40:21 They can’t, or they wouldn’t use fearmongering, lies, and manipulation to try to destroy the #2A
1260 2018-05-30 21:40:14 his stance is he would legalize cannabis for serious conditions, including cancer & since national cancer institute admitted cannabis kills cancer 2rs ago & I've seen so many ppl cure cancer with cannabis oil. Corbyn is the only one who would do anything about it.
1261 2018-05-30 21:39:52 A fast-paced and 3D stealth game about peak oil.
1262 2018-05-30 21:39:47 Have you tried Extra Strength CBD oil for that?
1263 2018-05-30 21:39:47 Yet it has caused economies to fall into big deficits and turmoil. That is what happened to Canada in 2008, and 45 yrs of economic mismanagement by the Alberta PC Party. We need a stable source of economic growth. Oil isn't it. #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet
1264 2018-05-30 21:39:36 Facts niggas be ungrateful ain’t no point in havin one of them care especially if you can’t afford for service charges. My cousin BMW oil change at the place he got from like almost 200$

1267 2018-05-30 21:39:13 Have you ever tried CBD oil before?
1268 2018-05-30 21:39:03 This message brought to you by oil money for hellworld
1269 2018-05-30 21:38:58 The reverence in which Viv is held by oil patch boosters never ceases to amaze. One of my energy economist sources called her conclusions "bordering on conspiracy theory." Since then, ain't no bordering about it.
1270 2018-05-30 21:38:58 I’m staring at the condiment shelf looking for olive oil for a combined half an hour after 3 separate passes through this aisle only to make the discovery that olive oil is in a different aisle and I very well could have asked but I’d rather get shot in the face from close range
1271 2018-05-30 21:38:53 Im saying that its could be a dodge charger  or sumn not a luxury vehicle sheeshhh...its nothing really a oil change and  tires...
1272 2018-05-30 21:38:50 So you won’t mind it again then? 

Imagine if you were a parent of a fallen child. Not wishing it on you. Preventing the next one is all you would have. Would not bring your child back but doing nothing has no preventive component. Come to the table to get change we can live with
1273 2018-05-30 21:38:43 how does this square with his "brutal truth/fuck your feelings" snake oil routine?

1275 2018-05-30 21:38:42 The Geneva convention is a peace accord signed by 196 counties in 1949. It’s the basis for the United Nations. In 1892 the U.K. ruled the world. Over 1/3 of the world population in fact. Rockafella ran an American oil company but that didn’t effect the rest of the world.

1277 2018-05-30 21:38:29 Funny you say that with no hard proof. If that were the case why do so many oil companies want a pipeline to tidal water???? Think the Tyee would rather support foreign interest instead of Canadian jobs
1278 2018-05-30 21:38:26 True bc an oil change on a Mercedes is easily $200
1279 2018-05-30 21:38:24 Unless you're a complete tool like a mate of mine whose suspicions were raised after putting in 10 litres of oil, only to realise he hadn't put the sump plug back in...
1280 2018-05-30 21:38:24 Maybe coconut or olive oil?
1281 2018-05-30 21:38:17 Frulli and Neck Oil inside the ground, as well as Carling and Bud Light for the less discerning.
1282 2018-05-30 21:38:11 the healing properties of cbd oil needs to be more publicized
1283 2018-05-30 21:38:00 Easy, yes. Crispy, no. 
Had to try this and did. The chips were fine and tasty and crunchy until I added salt in the colander. Then the oil oozed out and made them soggy and greasy. Basic chemistry at work. It is double fried again. But will start with cold on the first fry
1284 2018-05-30 21:38:00 With or without the oil spill?
1285 2018-05-30 21:37:44 And there is an evolution of one's conviction of belief in God to the point where God anoints him or her with the "Oil of God", the "Smearing of the Oil of God" which is one coming into spiritual contact with the Holy Spirit of God!  Amen.   And this Hebrew Israelite spiritual
1286 2018-05-30 21:37:44 Lol I seen shorty, but she jus be rubbing oil on she don’t b getting slayed. Drake trippin I’da claimed her lol.

1288 2018-05-30 21:37:38 Alberta’s oil has been the engine that has driven the Canadian economy just ask Quebec who have profited the most from Alberta’s oil .
1289 2018-05-30 21:37:37 For soup, cook sliced onion in oil, then simmer with pork, rosemary, mushroom broth and kale. Top with rosemary.
1290 2018-05-30 21:37:36 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1291 2018-05-30 21:37:27 Oh word, right i feel the same way, niggas want a Lambo and cant even afford an oil change  dummies, id rather have a business than a vehicle....
1292 2018-05-30 21:37:24 The Illuminent Vape Oil is our full spectrum oil, meaning this contains more cannabinoids than just CBD,  We also infuse our vape oils with Cannabis derived terpenes which are strain specific to provide a certain effect.  Our Isolate Eliquid is CBD in normal eliquid...
1293 2018-05-30 21:37:24 Thanks for answering My #QuickFire question@OliDavis.

Also @ThisisLukeOwen is trapped in a cupboard...

Do not listen to what Cod Liver Oil Luke says
1294 2018-05-30 21:37:17 marijuana is 300 for an ounce of flower much cheaper  also cbd's are now available in an oil you can get at most smoke shops many different kinds depending on your need just retailer they can tell which to buy hope it helps.

1313 2018-05-30 21:35:40 @TroyBilt refusing to honor warranty. Seriously? Claims we ran straight gas in trimmer. NO! Same oil mix used in all trimmers here. Only Troybilt quit after less than 40 days. Not happy.
1314 2018-05-30 21:35:38 The Illuminent Vape Oil has been designed to use in any vaping device.  For best results we have noticed the vape oil is more compatible with a device that is at least 15-40 watts.

1316 2018-05-30 21:35:36 Ok, point is? There was a working definition during the last ban correct? I agree looking scary is not criteria. But they had definition during last ban. We should start with that. The world didn’t end last time. Come on we can do this together get on board. Don’t be a Luddite
1317 2018-05-30 21:35:36 I just made a nice cosmetic oil blend of lavender, geranium, and sandalwood, to help ground the anxious energy in my heart.
1318 2018-05-30 21:35:30 Drink oil, eat coal.
1319 2018-05-30 21:35:11 I've actually been loving using my essential oil diffuser lately, I haven't heard of the flu bomb blend though - I literally wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy! 
1320 2018-05-30 21:35:08 Wrong. That is nothing but more angry rhetoric from pro pipeline supporters. Rhetoric from Cons that want the opposition silenced. Back up your claims with evidence. Pipelines only favor big oil and Alberta, not FN, BC, or Canada. #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet
1321 2018-05-30 21:35:07 Sure! Wasn’t a dig at you. Certainly public education hugely important but the whole mini mart plastic-sugar-palm oil machine also has a lot to answer for...

1323 2018-05-30 21:35:04 hey not a marvel centric tweet but the water in galveston has never looked this beautiful and clear since the oil spill and im so happy that my home looks so nice
1324 2018-05-30 21:34:52 It's easy. Riyadh has been good in the past at helping the US manage oil prices  in the past, softened its stance on Israel & this is the payoff: a free hand in Yemen.
1325 2018-05-30 21:34:49 Agree. I'm getting tired, first, of Trump 24/7 & his lies & whining. Let's get real news out there. People need to know. About the Monsanto/Bayer merge approval. Yeah, the ones killing all of our bees. Oil spills. Healthcare costs, etc. SICK OF TRUMP the whiner.
1326 2018-05-30 21:34:42 @HoelottaBilotta Oof! Did you get the oil changed yet?
1327 2018-05-30 21:34:37 Motor oil
1328 2018-05-30 21:34:35 I respect your point but we’re not their in renewables yet it’s going to take decades before it replaces fossil fuels. Our economy will fluctuate with the price of oil . The worlds economy fluctuates with the price of oil .

1338 2018-05-30 21:32:53 if that's true then why weren't they bought? $4.5B should have done the trick but the only ones who got bought was the texas oil giant who came up with this dodgy project
1339 2018-05-30 21:32:51 He’s a leader, the other was not. There’s a difference from being a CEO, and a snake oil salesman, hiding behind your title. Still, there’s more to being a leader than eye contact and respect...but that’s where it starts.

1361 2018-05-30 21:30:26 They don’t realize them foreigns need plus or supreme . An oil change bout a $100+ .. factor in a high insurance rate with a car note, buddy would be living check to check barely affording the car
1362 2018-05-30 21:30:24 Oil's not going anywhere soon, and we have lots of it, so..
1363 2018-05-30 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1364 2018-05-30 21:30:11 sooner.  But Olmert rejected Abbas' plan for exporting tar sands oil pipeline. James Hansen warns Obama that the subsequent flight: a flight
1365 2018-05-30 21:30:06 Gonna make meat balls with dear , elk and lamb meat with sun dried tomato and olive oil sauce
1366 2018-05-30 21:30:02 Stab them with a fork put them in the microwave for 4 or 5 mins take them out drizzle them with olive oil & dump a shit pile of salt on them wrap them in foil & put them on the grill for 10 or 15 mins....the salt forms a crust that makes the skin amazing
1367 2018-05-30 21:29:54 Do your homework. Trumps economy is not any better than Obama’s. Oil prices are much higher, HC more expensive, job growth down. Obama also had record unemployment numbers. Don’t let your hatred for Obama get in the way of real facts. Trump has done nothing but help the Rich.
1368 2018-05-30 21:29:50 I got oil on my gleemer shirt and now I want to cry 
1369 2018-05-30 21:29:50 Ha ha ha, I like it! But I’m mad at my boyfriend today, he’s got a real buddy-buddy deal going with some oil companies that is breaking my delicate heart. ~Jenn
1370 2018-05-30 21:29:28 Lol damn that oil change part hell if the gas price is 6 dollars people gonna still put 10 on stall 6 am i lieing
1371 2018-05-30 21:29:17 one a 30 cal carbine is that correct? Listen, Gun lovers want to dive into mire of restrictions. Keep in mind that is to accommodate you, not me. I’d be happy to go back to the descriptions used in the last ban. would that work for you? Not a liberal voted for Reagan, USMC family
1372 2018-05-30 21:29:15 Hopefully the clamour by countries to drop the dollar for oil will be so large, the US will be unable to attack all of them
1373 2018-05-30 21:29:10 I overdid it with the sesame oil when I made broccoli beef.
1374 2018-05-30 21:29:03 Welp just took a bath in hot as hydrolic oil way beyond over shitty equipment
1375 2018-05-30 21:28:42 I haven't heard any rationale discussion from the onset. I want to know one thing: how Canada can meet our Paris Accord commitments if oil sands expansion proceeds (the pipeline is designed to accommodate that.) Absolutely nobody on the "pro" side has been able to tell me that.
1376 2018-05-30 21:28:38 If we did not need $1 trillion in fuel in the USA, and we did not need to support crazy governments with oil, the military savings could be about 1/2 the current $886 billion/year spent.  How?  Want to discuss?  seaplaneguy@msn.com
1377 2018-05-30 21:28:21 Since when has giving things away been a scam it's not snake oil
1378 2018-05-30 21:28:03 Don't ever kid yourself the LIBs bought the KM pipeline, but I think it's with the intention of not getting it built.  The oil will stay in the ground!
1379 2018-05-30 21:28:01 Use baby oil to take it off
1380 2018-05-30 21:28:00 Great action picture what a shame the rain came and spoilt the night !
1381 2018-05-30 21:27:54 Jordan and I are all vapour rubbed up with olbas oil sprinkled everywhere. The definition of romance.

1383 2018-05-30 21:27:16 @realDonaldTrump When are you going to chastise the oil companies for overcharging for gasoline and diesel?  Just because it's summer season, people are going on vacation they think they can gouge us on fuel prices.  They manipulate supply and pricing and lie about why......
1384 2018-05-30 21:26:41 While there are situations where there are real needs - he just opened the door to every snake oil salesman out there.
1385 2018-05-30 21:26:39 People think that these conditions will change with tweaks in diet exercise it isn't that easy....not to mention most have tried all the snake oil quacks diet plans hoping for a miracle cure
1386 2018-05-30 21:26:16 इतना सुतियापा....
1387 2018-05-30 21:26:12 When it’s 500 bucks to fix a gasket seal on my oil pan like wtf#
1388 2018-05-30 21:26:12 *Good* mayo cam be made from olive oil, an egg, mustard powder, and salt, but you need an immersion blender, and it doesn't work out well on high humidity days.
1389 2018-05-30 21:26:08 Depending on assumptions, applications, solar use and on and on, the real savings for my engine is somewhere around $1 trillion/year USA and 9 more world wide.  Solve this issue and you solve poverty, not to mention terrorist funding of rogue groups that control oil.  Help?
1390 2018-05-30 21:25:59 It's prepared great in a pot filled with water and a bit of vinegar. This guy just added a small amount of water, as it he was using oil.
1391 2018-05-30 21:25:46 Using baby oil to remove tan has been the best trick ever. Looking and feeling like a slug for half an hour is worth it! I have never felt so smooth and my tan has never looked so good 
1392 2018-05-30 21:25:38 small problem. Solar panels and wind power are made with products that require oil. So are approx 6000 other items. We do not always think beyond the internal combustion engine.
1393 2018-05-30 21:25:24 You can’t run androids on fuel consisting of oil from whale blubber
1394 2018-05-30 21:25:21 If I ever offended anyone with any anti-christian tweets, it was the fish oil supplements. I was fish oil supplement tweeting.
1395 2018-05-30 21:25:14 i got an Avo Bomb, the Experimenter, got a bath oil(forgot the name lmao) and i copped Mask of Magnaminty alsoooo
1396 2018-05-30 21:25:10 If on a pole just put some oil on it or if hanging...put some oil on it. Works every time and it's super funny to watch.
1397 2018-05-30 21:25:07 I need to get ahold of some cannabis oil.
1398 2018-05-30 21:25:06 my new body oil spilled ALL in my bag. like the entire bottle is gone..... I’m....... depressed. to say the least.
1399 2018-05-30 21:25:05 Ok. Then it will. Who is in a better position to take that risk, Canada, or countries where women can't drive?

I don't wish an oil spill on anyone, but its a small globe we live on. Canada will build it better and have a better response if there is an issue.

And no war, too.
1400 2018-05-30 21:25:03 If I do not get perfume oil from Ayokaade mehn I’m not gon rest 
1401 2018-05-30 21:25:00 Timmins has Kirkland lake. If you’re like me you vested in the mine 3 years ago. its share value was only $4z its not too late. At $24 with rising rates oil shock on the horizon & China’s big move you’re apt to see another %100 rise in the course of 5 years. GLTY do your own Dd
1402 2018-05-30 21:24:56 The artificial increase in the oil prices may be momentary due to Saudi-Russian collusion to cut down oil supply + American strategy to push their Shale producers in the market to take the benefit of increased oil prices (topping it via scrapping of JCPOA + Venezuela sanctions).
1403 2018-05-30 21:24:55 One of the world's best snake oil salesmen helping snake oil salesmen the world around.
1404 2018-05-30 21:24:43 I’ve slapped coconut oil on me scalp and then found an eighteen inch hair in the spag bol 
1405 2018-05-30 21:24:33 Try CBD oil...my husband has chronic pain and has started using this...appears to be helping.
1406 2018-05-30 21:24:28 Use some kind of sugar scrub. Use a coconut oil one!
1407 2018-05-30 21:24:19 This was not a gift from US to Iran. It was Iran's money (and oil income) seized in the US. Whether you think Iran deserves its own money is of course a question.
1408 2018-05-30 21:24:14 Brazilian Oil Workers Go on Strike, despite Labor Court's Ruling #Mayabeque #RadioMayabeque #Cuba #CubaRadio96http://www.radiomayabeque.icrt.cu/en/news/internationals/11591-brazilian-oil-workers-go-on-strike-despite-labor-court-s-ruling
1409 2018-05-30 21:24:03 Fry a clove of garlic in oil and then cut the clove in half and wrap it in a cotton ball- ALWAYS works!
1410 2018-05-30 21:23:57 ああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああ
1411 2018-05-30 21:23:56 Cant wait till they ban foreign sales of domesticly produced oil~ then U Guys Can Stop Bending Us Over & Gas Prices Will Be Back At A Reasonable Rate !
1412 2018-05-30 21:23:55 Why is everyone so surprised Trump’s base is parroting dear leader’s rhetoric? They’ve bought his snake oil. Stop asking! Or stop thinking that if you keep asking you’ll get a different answer.
1413 2018-05-30 21:23:50 Okay seriously - mother looks like Olive Oil and kid looks like Tiger Woods. They have different names, etc.  at some point folks our daily jobs require us to go with the obvious not think every situation is an exception.
1414 2018-05-30 21:23:46 I know this dude changing my oil is overcharging me $20 but I’m too lazy to fight it. 
Sure buddy, give me the premium blend because no other kind is acceptable for my car. Go for it.
1415 2018-05-30 21:23:41 Like kemo is good for you. Everything is snake oil until the FDA approves it?
1416 2018-05-30 21:23:40 the oil in my face is highlighter
1417 2018-05-30 21:23:37 Oil was damn near $73 a BL before it tanked back down to $67-$68 a BL this morning....
1418 2018-05-30 21:23:30 Oh somebody is really shitting in his pants when EU Bureaucrats watching #Italy closely  No country can afford to leave the euro and the eurocrisis started because of the oil and gas in #Greece
1419 2018-05-30 21:23:18 Avon skin so soft dry oil spray is the best thing ever !!!
1420 2018-05-30 21:23:10 #OOTTmoron s (like Anas Alhajji) tried for months to discredit US oil production. It's about to slap them in the face. Like I said in January in #OOTT, 2018 will not be too kind to #OOTTmoron s. #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #DXY
1421 2018-05-30 21:23:07 ya be slathering ya face in oil then stepping out in the sun taking pix i just know it 
1422 2018-05-30 21:23:06 It’s tough to say since most of the issues affecting the province are the result of something out of their control: oil prices.
1423 2018-05-30 21:22:58 Fuck them all!! You are in a position to do great things re canabis oil & you should expand on that & 1 day put the pharma bastards out of business  #1life #healersrock #jointhenunsincolorado #dontsweatthehaters #enjoysavinglives #godspeedyoullsucceed 
1424 2018-05-30 21:22:50 U know I will. Or extra virgin olive oil, I got the hook up from a spot in the Bronx shit is unfiltered straight from Italy
1425 2018-05-30 21:22:37 And now we have higher petrol prices everywhere. And that bump up in oil prices helped Russia a great deal. Their economy sunk when the barrel price went below $50.
1426 2018-05-30 21:22:28 Try CBD oil...need to use it consistently to see a difference or a CBD gaping pen...the medical marijuana here in NJ is so expensive, too.  My hubby has Stage 4 kidney cancer and my son got him a vaping pen and it helps with the pain.
1427 2018-05-30 21:22:22 That’s a great example of not having white privilege @Whoeverknows101 Feeling privileged enough that you purchase and intend to build an oil pipeline through First Nations territory that disapproves of it while at the same time genuinely believing your their friend is the example
1428 2018-05-30 21:22:07 It's an attack and your argument fails to reach the floor.
Next, the COTUS is the non value added framework you must account for in your process mapping.
Amending our the 2A is not realistic, certainly you understand such.
1429 2018-05-30 21:22:01 You're the joke here buddy. Go change some oil or something.
1430 2018-05-30 21:21:58 When German EU Commissioner refers to markets here, he is refering to the global banks, financial quangos & rating agencies which fix the market. There is no free market, the establishment can turn the economy off or on as it suits them like Arabs fixing the oil price.
1431 2018-05-30 21:21:53 You probably like the oil drop meteorite gear thing
1432 2018-05-30 21:21:49 The ones established for the oil sands.
1433 2018-05-30 21:21:33 Lady is dumb, and doesn't know what she is talking about. Oil is coming back after a bad 2-3 year stretch.
1434 2018-05-30 21:21:31 I had a dream last night where my dog and my cat obliterated all of my oil paint brushes along with all my canvases with projects in progress

I woke up in a cold sweat with some tears in my eyes panicking, thinking I was sending some animals to the pound today
1435 2018-05-30 21:21:17 Yep that’s what we say but market is locked down like all plastics by the same oil industry that’s killing our planet
1436 2018-05-30 21:21:03 May add some meat from time to time but just in it for the lettuce may not even do the Caesar dressing Maydo lemon juice and olive oil
1437 2018-05-30 21:21:02 There must be alien parasites in the oil paint.  I would suggest getting some new stuff
1438 2018-05-30 21:20:52 @CaptSandyYawn stressed last season how important it was for her crew to rest in order to function. She didn’t seem to care @hannahferrier_ was burning the midnight oil.. hopefully she is more of her last season self next ep.
1439 2018-05-30 21:20:45 DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY 1 EXIT 99¢ BE BEEF TURN MAIL FEAR CENTER CHECK ENFORCED COLLISION BALLISTIC PHOTO PLAYERS ENTER DRUGS
1440 2018-05-30 21:20:45 i think that paying to pitch your startup/ICO is so backwards. the entire reason why startups/ICO need to pitch is for investment. so much snake oil out there from people trying to turn a quick buck. sad.
1441 2018-05-30 21:20:41 I am in the blue of my life
An abstract stage
Old oil drying on the pallet
1442 2018-05-30 21:20:39 Buhari and his cabals looted $3b in the name of oil search in the dry sahara desert when oil competent Presidents are seeking movement away from oil, buhari is a disaster
1443 2018-05-30 21:20:37 Environmentalists are hypocrites if they use anything derived from oil.
1444 2018-05-30 21:20:30 A little over 5,000 miles on getting an oil change, but it's finally happening 
I'm so bad with cars...
1445 2018-05-30 21:20:06 I need this Argan Treatment Mask bc I like how argan oil feels on my hair! Argan oil mask is still an unfamiliar thing in our current local market so it will be a pleasure to try this out and share my thoughts to public 
1446 2018-05-30 21:20:03 USD API Weekly Crude Oil Stock diumumkan : 1.001M sebelumnya : -1.300M
1447 2018-05-30 21:19:57 Trying to retain your youth is a pointless & expensive task - people need to get over their vanity & stop supporting these snake oil companies with their empty promises.
1448 2018-05-30 21:19:53 This is only bearish. Saudi Arabia is fucked. Jimboman again predicts oil's reality before they happen :)
1449 2018-05-30 21:19:44 That happen to me today except that i had all the ingredients all ready and cut but there was no cooking oil
1450 2018-05-30 21:19:43 They want oil...they have almost none of their own.

Iran will offer it at below market price as an incentive.
1451 2018-05-30 21:19:40 or liking olive oil but hating olives
1452 2018-05-30 21:19:37 Guys please please please don't buy anything with palm oil in because it leads to deforestation and the deaths of many creatures 
1453 2018-05-30 21:19:36 Totally!! He might haved used coco oil that in time haha
1454 2018-05-30 21:19:34 What exactly did he praise?The hyperinflation?Giving Venezuela's oil to the Chinese to pay down a debt they will never clear?The throngs of people starving in the street?Children given to orphanages so they won't starve?People hijacking foodtrucks like madmax?What's to praise?
1455 2018-05-30 21:19:30 It is amazing how ignorant pro pipeline supporters and @CPC_HQ are. Anti pipeline protesters have the Constitutional right to protest against pipelines and big oil. Clearly pipeline supporters are against #FreedomOfSpeech. #bcpoli #abpoli #StopKM #StopPipelines #AlbertaBullies
1456 2018-05-30 21:19:15 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1457 2018-05-30 21:19:12 Peanut oil?
1458 2018-05-30 21:19:03 I've tried two different pills to get rid of this migraine. And my headache oil. Nothing is working.
1459 2018-05-30 21:18:58 Largest oil producing refinery in the world! 
1460 2018-05-30 21:18:42 Magz was impressed with the pastry, made using spelt flour and olive oil. Much easier to make than other methods.
1461 2018-05-30 21:18:31 My dad took my car to get an oil change and he also washed my car
1462 2018-05-30 21:18:30 Oil prices is a global issue
1463 2018-05-30 21:18:25 The oil and port industry here is a bit too much for that, but it isn't a bad place to be
1464 2018-05-30 21:18:20 Who ever said that baby oil takes tan off is talking shit, literally just sat for 30 minutes with it on then exfoliated it off and I still have the same amount of fake tan on as I did before I did it, waste of time 
1465 2018-05-30 21:18:13 Tomatoes tossed in olive oil and balsamic... left for a while and linked on toasted sour dough bread.... just not with a full fry!!
1466 2018-05-30 21:18:13 @realDonaldTrump Mr President I just would like to know if there is any hope for a cut in fuel prices? I believe at one time you reported that we had a great oil supply of our own. yet fuel prices keep climbing. Thanks a Trump supporter
1467 2018-05-30 21:18:13 I think Gwilliam Paltrow has some good hints - something about steaming it over essential oil infused water and carrying a jade egg tied to the end of it?  IDK I don’t really read this “lifestyle” stuff, but my husband was telling me about it. I was trying to watch the football.
1468 2018-05-30 21:18:11 Fried in olive oil, butter & garlic...Yummmmmy
1469 2018-05-30 21:18:08 Vi bør absolutt ut av Snake Oil
1470 2018-05-30 21:17:59 I am really hoping Wahlstrom or koktnemei are available for the oil as no Dmen will help this year. I really wouldn't mind Dobson but me thinks he will be gone by our 10th pick.
1471 2018-05-30 21:17:52 I've ordered a few litres of antifreeze. I'll sort the oil out in the weekend. 
1472 2018-05-30 21:17:49 no that would be proximity to oil money
1473 2018-05-30 21:17:45 I could fit SO MANY 944s in that building, man. So much room to dribble oil and coolant all over. Haha.
1474 2018-05-30 21:17:43 You have got to be kidding. You're having oil while their kids are dying from oil, coal, and gas removal. Now more will die because Trump is killing the EPA.

You're just another liar.
1475 2018-05-30 21:17:18 Bet!! I mean, all I do is oil my scalp and do a wash/hot oil rinse every few weeks
1476 2018-05-30 21:16:59 Only you could turn a money-making venture like an oil pipeline from Alberta, into a multi-billion dollar loss for the taxpayers.

You are bad at your job. Resign.
1477 2018-05-30 21:16:42 Rex Tillerson is the only guy in the world that could put an oil company in the red.
1478 2018-05-30 21:16:30 I'm always happy to pay over three bucks a gallon when our wonderful POTUS made sure Big Oil pays less in taxes than ever and all us little people are getting bent over. Thanks @realDonaldTrump #MAGA one hard earned dollar at a time! 
1479 2018-05-30 21:16:30 See how you'd add oil, he added water.
1480 2018-05-30 21:16:23 and I don't agree with the states who decided to legalize Cannabis, CBD oil and the like to treat epilepsy.

Medication like Lamictal is the only way to control it.
1481 2018-05-30 21:16:11 I know this one is central, but he’s committed a whole universe of crimes in addition to this one....when they all come spilling out like a black, slimy oil spill, nobody in the world will be able to believe the scope of his abject criminality.
1482 2018-05-30 21:16:07 Removing ar.s is patently unconstitutional,  even modern sporting arms are now, "common use."
Remember from class those nva things which cannot be removed from the process?
1483 2018-05-30 21:16:02 Greasy like oil
1484 2018-05-30 21:15:54 Ummm they can’t find my car  I just wanted an oil change 
1485 2018-05-30 21:15:53 Probably needs a oil change. Take it to like, auto zone, and ask them to do a free diagnostic test.
1486 2018-05-30 21:15:52 Google Rick Simpson Phoenix Tears for how to make oil.
1487 2018-05-30 21:15:52 'In case anyone wondered, this is how the world ends: with the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world going fully in the tank for the oil industry.'

I think @billmckibben was even more upset by this move than me!
1488 2018-05-30 21:15:49 As one who works in the oil & gas industry - prices are very cyclical. Up and down pricing has been going on for years.
1489 2018-05-30 21:15:44 Make it into rosin, or oil. Store. Sell to markets in enlightened nations.
1490 2018-05-30 21:15:40 ALSO BOUGHT A NEW CLEANSING OIL ITS FROM HADA LABO WITH SUPER HYALURONIC ACID PLS BE DA BOMB

Universities owners ,Publishing house owners, 50bedroom Mansion owners etc. IBB,OBJ,Shonekan,GEJ,Abacha all former head of States owns oil blocks by proxies ,but PMB's sin is he does not own one or by proxies . This is a former military Head of State & a Military Pet.Minister

1494 2018-05-30 21:15:15 They had slogan from their media campaign on the back I gather...but agreed weird; perhaps trying to emulate the I love oil sands tshirts etc.
1495 2018-05-30 21:15:06 The law doesn't work. In 2017 1.4 billion cedis was lost to corruption within our oil industry and the alleged culprits were found in the presidency, customs, GRA and  other companies. None of them were brought to book

1501 2018-05-30 21:14:40 You make castille soap! I always use a small amount of coconut oil to enhance foaming
1502 2018-05-30 21:14:38 #1linewed I pulled open the drawer next to the sink: Tincture of Cilantro, Garlic oil, ground rosemary powder and a loofah. Under the loofah I found four itty-bitty band aids, the kind you use for a papercut on your little finger. Better than nothing. I stuck them in my pocket.
1503 2018-05-30 21:14:14 We have CBD oil here in WA State and also THC edibles - also vapes and waxes, etc.
1504 2018-05-30 21:14:13 Honestly their maracuja oil was great originally so idk why this was even necessary lmao 
1505 2018-05-30 21:14:10 Access to unresearched, non FDA approved snake oil.
1506 2018-05-30 21:14:06 misery! one of them has just come in and before I noticed, plunged his head into an open pot of deli olives and started licking the oil off. He leaves the olives
1507 2018-05-30 21:14:04 Mm guess who’s dumb ass forgot that coconut oil melts when it’s hot, thus managing to pour it all over their bed tryna open the jar

1509 2018-05-30 21:13:53 That's what happens when you run healthcare like an industry and not as a social service.

Re your dad get him edibles or oil. Wish I could be of more help.
1510 2018-05-30 21:13:44 That pisses me off so bad, ok go get him some of that oil, it's legal and helped my sis. If we used the oil we could cut down on the morphine, she was coherent much longer.

1522 2018-05-30 21:12:02 Right and insurance/maintenance won’t be super expensive. A nigga walking to work can’t afford $250 oil changes on a Benz.
1523 2018-05-30 21:11:58 The "Oil of God" and it comes from God, and falls upon the people who have evolved their lives away from the corruption of Satan to the purity of God in their mind, soul, and body!

1524 2018-05-30 21:11:58 Day 4 on @NaturesUltra CBD Oil. Anxiety has come down a HUGE amount, but taking it 3 times per day on 500mg. I feel like once per day 1500mg might be the right dosage. Was able to upload a new vid AND stream for 4 hours for the first time in a month #CBD #CBDOil #CBDOils #CBDLife
1525 2018-05-30 21:11:51 And they callin her a pornstar when all she did was rub oil on her naked body and shake her ass. Couldn’t find one video of her getting bussed down. Pinky is a pornstar. Shawty just a naked model

1528 2018-05-30 21:11:35 While waiting on an oil change today, someone was wearing a shirt w/ a bunch of names on it. The name, Viola, stood out to me, and I thought what a cool #Shakespeare shirt! Turns out it was a @Twins  w/  greats not Shakes’ greats =also cool to me  #baseballfan #actorslife
1529 2018-05-30 21:11:29 A lot of vaporisation is from conducted heat (particularly after parking up) You may want to fit a new insulation Carb gasket/spacer as over the years they oil soak & loose insulation value Better still fit a thicker one & longer studs, plus change fuel pump one too(if mech)
1530 2018-05-30 21:11:27 Since we have now subsidized our oil industry, we should expect tariffs on oil & gasoline from US. We can also be perceived as weak when it comes to other NAFTA negotiations. We are about to see some economic hardships.
1531 2018-05-30 21:11:18 Let the people have their CBD oil
1532 2018-05-30 21:11:14 Olive oil is acc so disgusting
1533 2018-05-30 21:11:05 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
1534 2018-05-30 21:11:04 Idk about y’all but I be feeling like the shit after an oil change
1535 2018-05-30 21:11:01 You should look into CBD oil. You can get it at any cannabis shop. And order it online in some states. Read up on it.
1536 2018-05-30 21:10:59 3.What you are seeing playing today is the same way PMB was villified by the media and the West in 1983 when he was overthrown by corrupt IBB & his gang of criminals who institutionalize corruption in Nigeria. Buhari does nt belong to their "gang". The "gang" of oil block owners

1541 2018-05-30 21:10:23 The stupidity of their arguments.... all the time. A mechanic does not buy the customers parts. A mechanic does not buy oil for every customer for 10 months, etc..... so dumb....

1548 2018-05-30 21:10:02 Thanks for asking! We discontinued it in 2016. Instead, try our Johnson's Head To Toe Extra moisturizing baby cream. It’s enriched with baby oil to help hydrate and lock in moisture all day and night.
1549 2018-05-30 21:09:39 I'm just wondering when is @MorganStanley going to stop backing the oil industry.
1550 2018-05-30 21:09:37 Everyone thats had pharma poisons forced on them need to keep their 1 sided opinions to themselves & get off the shit & on the oil #canabiscuresall #likeitornot

1552 2018-05-30 21:09:24 you don’t want to address gun issue or feel there is not one, great. That is your opinion. We don’t need to data deny if there is no common goal, agreed?

1556 2018-05-30 21:09:04 I have changed my oil 1x this year. Now that I drive even less than the 12mi/day I drove last year, I may not change it till next year.
1557 2018-05-30 21:09:00 I ordered stuff (shampoo, conditioner, essential oil) through Aramex and I received an email from them that the items are stopped at Canada's customs as unacceptable material

1. He didn’t have to do that 
2. The man was walking, now he driving.
3. He got an Altima so his oil change and maintance in the future gone be cheap so he good long term.
1567 2018-05-30 21:07:50 The title argument may be valid, because Cal only has 1. But championships are tough to win.

1594 2018-05-30 21:04:56 Yes I know of them. We are not talking about the snake oil salesmen. These are real doctors and medical professionals trying to help a terminally ill person. Getting ripped off has and always will be a risk not only for the terminally ill but for us all.
1595 2018-05-30 21:04:49 I myself smoked for my back (herniated discs) and my shoulders (2 torn rotator cuffs) but now bc of my heart problems I may have to move to oils/edibles..bonus though ...CBD oil is good for the heart 
1596 2018-05-30 21:04:48 I’m saying less guns = less gun deaths. I am saying if my son had a alcohol problem or a depression problem or any other issue that professionals said made him be suicidal I would remove my firearms from my house. IMO Our house (USA) is suicidal. Not just teens but veterans

1601 2018-05-30 21:04:32 Really @JustinTrudeau ? Why are you making Canadian Taxpayer pay for this old tech? Nothing cutting edge about tar sands oil.

1612 2018-05-30 21:03:30 This can be a free pass to many snake oil salesmen. I'm for opening up some access, but I don't want these trials to be offered with any cost, that has to be born solely by the practitioners.
1613 2018-05-30 21:03:30 This is in the publics best interest! Are you going to replace the thousands of misplaced workers in western Canada if this pipeline is not built? The world will be burning oil with, or without Canadian oil.

China, around 30%... go take your circus show there will you and leave Canada alone.
1616 2018-05-30 21:03:06 I don't like the personal insults and name calling, but I have yet to hear #Trudeau explain how Canada can meet our Paris Climate Accord commitments with a expanding oil sands production that this pipeline facilitates. Most experts suggest this just isn't possible.
1617 2018-05-30 21:03:01 I can give it my very best shot! I have a set of basic colors & some paper for oil painting, but I'll let you know if I end up needing to buy any additional paint, if that sounds fair?

1625 2018-05-30 21:02:33 In the oil industry has a saying ”paint it blue and call it new”
1626 2018-05-30 21:02:32 A point of the steel tariffs was that it was needed for national security. America had a 40 year ban on exporting oil for the exact same reason, national security after the 70s shortages.

As the price of gas spikes as we going to see the MAGA wears demand an end to oil exports?
1627 2018-05-30 21:02:26 #OOTT US grabbing market share was expected. And as Brent- WTI  spread continues to widen .. we are beginning to see the cracks in the correlation. Maybe they can find some martians and sell Brent at $300 to them..$40 WTI for the earthlings.:)
1628 2018-05-30 21:02:22 I baked my first swiss roll when I was 11 years old. I remember it so vividly. I also had an amazing chocolate cake recipe growing up. I had ripped it out of an aunt's "Your Family" mag. Recipe used oil. Do not have it any longer. It was sooooo good!!!!
1629 2018-05-30 21:02:20 hope the oil filler cap is on tight.
1630 2018-05-30 21:02:17 He  was right for not buying buddy a luxury car. You suppose to put premium gas in those cars.  My mans was just taking the bus. He not ready for that premium life and ridiculous costly oil changes
1631 2018-05-30 21:02:17 I agree with you.  We must do more to transition to renewables, we are sadly behind in these efforts. However, it is the revenues from our oil resources that can pay for the transition. Restricting oil production is premature. Our world needs it; the demand will be met by someone
1632 2018-05-30 21:02:07 am i going to get in trouble for flying across international borders with cbd oil? we shall see
1633 2018-05-30 21:02:01 Meet Melissa - Pastry Chef/star server here at Merchant. 

This week she whipped up a lemon olive oil cake  with rhubarb, candied pistachios and mascarpone. 

Stop in one out!
1634 2018-05-30 21:02:00 When it comes to CBD I’ve been told to dose heavily and minimize until you find your dose. Is it drops for under the tongue or like honey oil? The potency might be very mild
1635 2018-05-30 21:01:56 The way someone addresses an audience plays a huge part in how that audience listens, or if they'll even listen at all.
Again, you seem to be drilling down with a preconceived root cause. This is naive.
1636 2018-05-30 21:01:44 If oil drips on my coat I'm gonna go nuts
1637 2018-05-30 21:01:36 This is the 4th time I am doing monthly subscription in one month. No wonder they say data is the new oil. 
1638 2018-05-30 21:01:29 Bathed in coconut oil is the best thing I ever done  I’m so soft 
1639 2018-05-30 21:01:12 So my very anti-drug aunt told me I should try cannabis oil for my fibromyalgia, she's heard it works well. I told her I've tried marijuana, it doesn't help me. She said no, try cannabis. She had no idea they are the same thing. Points to the industry for the re-branding.

1641 2018-05-30 21:01:02 I do like dried tobacco and some Castile soap so it stays put but tbh neem oil is only gonna help so yeah try it and let me know how it works out
1642 2018-05-30 21:01:02 Agreed. 
1643 2018-05-30 21:00:59 it was either the grape or the vegetable oil i chose the oil
1644 2018-05-30 21:00:43 It's almost as if some of this was an extortion racket selling snake oil to marks, but that'd of course be an entirely humorous comment in infinite jest.
1645 2018-05-30 21:00:42 Inflation is down because oil prices fell globally since 2014 and they are on rise again. UPA 1 saw the highest growth rates ever in the history. Road making is a direct consequence of our increased GDP. I am sure more roads could be built in 2019-2024 whoever wins
1646 2018-05-30 21:00:39 Implementing this percentage increase... and then talking about it comes with benefits by removing VAT from breadbasket items. Like people is sit down and eat tomato paste and drink oil.

1660 2018-05-30 21:00:01 Is this a refinery or crude oil exploration plant? Because you said producing 650,000 barrels per day. Maybe you meant refining 650,000 barrels per day. Please clarify. What we need is a refinery not a crude oil plant.
1661 2018-05-30 20:59:51 Pass the baby oil!
1662 2018-05-30 20:59:47 tanning oil is actually a look
1663 2018-05-30 20:59:44 "where is oil, where is gas" would sound both closer to the original and better rhythmically. 

"Pussy Riot took off their colorful masks -- what a pity.
But they look so good without them, they look so pretty."
1664 2018-05-30 20:59:44 More like it caused deficits, caused the Canadian and Albertan economies to slump. The Canadian economy is based on more than oil. And the country needs to start diversifying to #RenewableEnergy and to new sectors. #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet #KeepItInTheGround
1665 2018-05-30 20:59:41 They’ll just give you ibuprofen 800 and put you on a shitty birth control  I have HORRID periods and the pain is just insane so I totally get it. CBD lotion and oil seems to ease a lot and of course if I smoke but, most of the time, we just out here dealin lmao

1668 2018-05-30 20:59:32 I'm just trying to watch queer eye videos on youtube during my lunch breaks and I get bombarded with stand for alaska ads paid for by huge oil companies and spreading inaccurate information yikes!
1669 2018-05-30 20:59:26 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
1670 2018-05-30 20:59:24 I hear you on the scrubbing part.  I try to scrub my living room at least once a week.  My dog is a rescue, and won’t whine or anything when she has to go out, so she is always making messes.  Good old Murphy’s oil soap and that miracle odor stuff.
1671 2018-05-30 20:59:19 @DoctorChrisVT How is it that our highly educated doctors are so gullible to the snake oil claims of the drug companies and all too willing to prescribe unnecessary, ineffective or at worst harmful substances? Who are the real pushers? #TheDoctorWhoGaveUpDrugs
1672 2018-05-30 20:59:15 This would ultimately cut our dependency on foreign oil as well. Thus our bloated military budget & that money could be reallocated towards power grid infrastructure updates & would provide valuable UNION jobs to help stabilize unemployment.
1673 2018-05-30 20:58:55 It really is, it's the most misunderstood illness. Hopefully they will do something in the future  that seems to be the way forward at the moment. I'm going to try out the oil in a vape machine soon. Might help! Fingers crossed
1674 2018-05-30 20:58:45 I’m talking about the nonTHC CBD oil. It’s legal in America and can be bought without a prescription. Made from hemp.
1675 2018-05-30 20:58:42 In the 1980s we had Home Economics in junior high. Learned most of the above there - Daddy taught me how to change a tire and oil (I’d rather pay someone to do the latter, though!)
1676 2018-05-30 20:58:33 You are 100% wrong. There are NO slowflakes on desert planets. And oil is not the issue. The universe is battling for clean air, bottled up in Perri-air. And our economy isn't what's at stake, it's the Druish people. This is FACT. I have 25 year old proof on film. #GeekPolitics

1698 2018-05-30 20:56:42 yes we are in debt. But that doesn’t stop us from bombing 8 countries right now does it? All illegal. Or stop us from increasing military spending or giving giant corporations handouts that they don’t need. OIL is probably the biggest industry and we suck its teet

1719 2018-05-30 20:53:55 Fun fact about marijuana, 2 of the reasons that there was support to ban it was the fact that paper could be made out of it cheaper & timber merchants & the oil industry,the same ones who have been so deceitful for over a century knew that hemp oil would be better than theirs

1728 2018-05-30 20:52:52 Yes, I said oil but meant fossil fuels.

You’re 100% correct.

The extra energy that goes into making the H2 means you’d be better just burning the methane than pretending the H2 is clean.
1729 2018-05-30 20:52:48 There is a big difference between government violating the constitution, and individuals making a decision in their own home. By the way, no, I wouldn't. I'd make sure the person hurting that way received help first. Removing one instrument, doesn't prevent the problem.

1741 2018-05-30 20:52:06 David, As others have said, if you have "resources" (wink, wink) use them. While you're doing that, you could start your Dad on a high concentration CBD oil made from hemp. If you want help with that, DM me.
1742 2018-05-30 20:51:51 It’s not fair that I don’t get to try @ChickfilA because nobody can cook my chicken in the canola oil and not the peanut oil. Sorry I don’t wanna die.

1744 2018-05-30 20:51:37 His grand strategy  "America First" can lead to opposite conclusions in the same instance: get involved or don't bother. You need a logical global framework to sell oil. You need it for foreign policy.
1745 2018-05-30 20:51:37 1) Not an independent Scotland's problem
2) MEast and English part of UK oil fields. Still not Scotland's problem.

1751 2018-05-30 20:51:09 I don’t think the Sterling criticism is down to racism, I think it’s down to the fact that he left Liverpool on bad terms, and went to an “oil club” in Man City. Media don’t like City, and love Liverpool, so it would make sense.
1752 2018-05-30 20:51:08 Mirá: fueron muchos años con la demanda expendiéndose al 4,5% anual y la producción de petróleo, gas y fuel oil estancada o decreciendo al 2%. Una serie más larga te permitiría verlo.
1753 2018-05-30 20:50:40 She could get it, no question. She just has to be gagged first.
1754 2018-05-30 20:50:38 No, I Didn't Cook My Own Meals Until Age 31, When I Destroyed My House in a Vegetable Oil Fire. And Here's Why It's Not OK To Make Fun of That
1755 2018-05-30 20:50:31 My mans got a Bentley ... his oil change be $1000  
 Fukk Dot
1756 2018-05-30 20:50:25 I’m making the Oil too lmao.
1757 2018-05-30 20:50:19 Coconut oil mixed with oatmeal & shea butter lotion >>>
1758 2018-05-30 20:50:06 Hi, I’m covered in coconut oil and the pool IS CLOSED ONCE AGAIN. 

Can our apartment complex please get their shit together at some point.
1759 2018-05-30 20:50:02 Besides the fact getting the man a Mercedes or better would’ve been fucked up. Y’all know how much just an oil change on a Mercedes is? Or replacing anything on it if he needed to?? He did him right regardless.
1760 2018-05-30 20:49:58 now that is a headline I never thought would actually- climate champion - oil baron
1761 2018-05-30 20:49:49 I can’t edit but I would take word frank out if it would get you back on topic
1762 2018-05-30 20:49:41 So let's just bring in American oil and give them all their money instead of keeping it in house? If you ran your company like this youd be bankrupt
1763 2018-05-30 20:49:31 I read an article years ago, way before Katrina and Rita, where Saudi oil ministers were speculating a $/gal that would shock the American public into buying less gas. $4/g was their estimate. We hit that after Rita and Tahoe sales crashed.
1764 2018-05-30 20:49:29 My experience with dealerships is usually more $$, occasionally cheaper (loss leader oil change w/ coupon for example), knowledge (or at least trained) staff and typically good customer service. I go there probably 70% of time for service.
1765 2018-05-30 20:49:24 sephora sells a product that’s just 100% raw coconut oil for like $38 and i’m pretty sure it’s a “moisturizer” like...first of all...if i want coconut oil i’m going to walmart not sephora
1766 2018-05-30 20:49:07 So what do you call someone so addicted to the situation that there judgement of root cause impaired? Only a alcoholic thinks more booze solves a frat house poisoning, correct? That person would be a booze freak IMO
1767 2018-05-30 20:48:58 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
1768 2018-05-30 20:48:53 The ones dragging Canada down is the @CPC_HQ and their attempts to force pipelines on the rest of country. You forgot when Canada's economy slumped due to over reliance on oil under Harper or 45 yrs of PC economic mismanagement in Alberta. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
1769 2018-05-30 20:48:35 You laughed and referred to them (if I recall correctly) as "death squares." In your defense, I didn't know how to make French toast; I thought you were supposed to fry the eggy bread in vegetable oil. I'm sure it was gross. But so are fish on a stick!
1770 2018-05-30 20:48:28 I got castor oil shampoo/argon oil conditioner to hopefully help with the alopecia. was worried it would be stinky like the rosemary oil. but it’s not! crisis averted. 

rosemary oil still is. but it’s the best thing for it. so I’ll just deal with it.
1771 2018-05-30 20:48:17 PET basically screwed the west with his energy program by buying the  largest refinery in Western Canada and shutting it down...so we buy the  bulk of imported gas in BC and Alberta at the highest prices in  Canada in BC...yet Alberta and BC have the oil...good planning...NOT!
1772 2018-05-30 20:48:15 i went on a swim in the ocean for the first time in 6 years and 2 hours later it starts smelling like gass and the police announce theres been an oil spillage and everyone need to leave. its ok i get it i wont swim in the ocean again
1773 2018-05-30 20:48:02 Yeah they charge 20 for that if you bring your stuff. Buy the oil and filter at Walmart way cheaper! If you do it yourself it’s 35 if you buy the stuff and take it somewhere it’ll be about 55.
1774 2018-05-30 20:48:01 This olive oil got Karter hair looking like a Gerri curl lol
1775 2018-05-30 20:47:54 What's your trouble area? Dark spots? Random breakouts? 

[Current Face Routine Trial]  
I wipe face with toner and then use Castor Oil for oil cleansing before I wash with Castile Soap. Pat dry add toner and then I moisturize.
1776 2018-05-30 20:47:43 raw organic coconut oil for taking off ur makeup is the biggest beauty hack like its $6 for a JAR and a dime sized amount will get ALL of it off!!!
1777 2018-05-30 20:47:43 That's what's up! Snake oil is about to make America great again.
1778 2018-05-30 20:47:41 Have you ever heard of changamwe oil refinery?
1779 2018-05-30 20:47:39 Like when you have a relaxing lavender oil bath and then feel like going to a klan rally
1780 2018-05-30 20:47:36 @Ibilola_Amao : what is legitimate operations in the downstream Oil & gas in Nigeria Dr. ?
1781 2018-05-30 20:47:31 Drove to the DFW Airport, did 50 oil changes, drove back, and already showered. Lol
1782 2018-05-30 20:47:31 I’m so sorry to hear this.  When my mom was dying of lung cancer (Dec 2015) we had my niece ship us the oil from Denver. You should have seen my mom’s face when that package would arrive. Lmao. Mom’s are truly priceless.  Take care!
1783 2018-05-30 20:47:17 Was in the dossier that Cohen went to Prague to meet some Russians & was why the FBI raided his place. Meeting never happened. Dossier said Page met Sechin to get 19% of Russian oil if sanctions were lifted. Page was on Fox & said it was a 30 sec exch of pleasantries in a hall!
1784 2018-05-30 20:47:13 At the oil change place, and sis recommending that I get the synthetic, which is double the normal price and I’m here like...but it’s synthetic though 
1785 2018-05-30 20:47:13 Oil money
1786 2018-05-30 20:47:10 The totalitarian regime as it is today very much came about from the collapse of the oil price. Not that everything was a dance on roses before, but it wasn't all bad. The totalitarian regime is absolutely the reason why nothing will change anytime soon though.
1787 2018-05-30 20:46:43 Paul if you had a family member that was hurting in such a way, the first thing you do is remove all guns from the house, correct?  For sure more guns not solution...

Think of it like trump keeping the Muslims out “until we figure out what is going on” 

we fix the crazy after
1788 2018-05-30 20:46:40 Coco oil every night for that dry and very damage hair 
1789 2018-05-30 20:46:34 I got tanner and now my face is excreting oil. I CANNOT WIN.
1790 2018-05-30 20:46:30 I remember in the 80's it wasn't trans fats but "Tropical Oils" that were going to kill us all! that's why theatres serve that disgusting popcorn made with canola oil, now. the nanny state very nearly BANNED coconut from the country. now we find coconut oil cures cancer
1791 2018-05-30 20:46:26 baby oil?
1792 2018-05-30 20:46:25 @narendramodi @PMOIndia @dpradhanbjp.Dear Sir, if u don't keep the Petroleum prices under control, it will cost ur PM job in 2019. PSU oil companies are exploiting us in the name of deregulation. They made a mockery of common man by reducing petrol prices by 1 paise even though
1793 2018-05-30 20:46:13 Sick of these alternative life haters! All they care about is money from pharma, pesticide corporations, big oil... Where I live, they hate marijuana, harass everyone, but do nothing about the tweekers even when they commmit crimes, just arrest & let go so they can repeat 
1794 2018-05-30 20:46:04 HUN !!! So have I !!! It must be at rape seed oil or something 
1795 2018-05-30 20:46:03 @Ibilola_Amao , #MPR is alien in Oil & Gas operations in Nigeria, I know MPR to be Monetary Policy Rate my Dr. & as for all the other requirements u mentioned & even more my coy is up to date
1796 2018-05-30 20:45:59 Here is where you need to stop. Stop calling people gun freaks. And, the number of rounds per minute is really irrelevant. Besides, an AR-15 isn't going to fire that fast. Machineguns are more regulated, and wrongly so by the way. You need to stop looking at the object.
1797 2018-05-30 20:45:51 True. That'd make me some kind of transcontinental pipeline... Trump would want to use me to pump oil cross-country! 
1798 2018-05-30 20:45:50 my hairline is so fragile rn - treating it with coconut oil infused with hemp and other oils. Hated the smell at first but I am getting used to it and its keeping my hair super soft and moist.
1799 2018-05-30 20:45:44 Now that you have played your fantasy out in your head and called us names, try again. 
Now use what is constitutional in your decision making process, and drill down to the actual "why people are now committing these types of sensational crimes?"
1800 2018-05-30 20:45:44 be awash with data / bumper harvest / drizzle olive oil / vintner /
1801 2018-05-30 20:45:41 I wonder if Coffee Shop still has french fries with truffle oil 
1802 2018-05-30 20:45:40 Nope real person. And again tar is made from coal not oil.
1803 2018-05-30 20:45:37 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1804 2018-05-30 20:45:34 LA FRENCH OIL OF ASS
1805 2018-05-30 20:45:30 Had to take a lavender oil pill again to make me calm so I can sleep sucks
1806 2018-05-30 20:45:23 What kind of oil do you use for squeaky hinges on your comicsgate?
1807 2018-05-30 20:45:21 I agree with you on that. I was referring to your statements on the early ‘90s recession with Rae/Mulroney being blamed. Bigger factors are stock market crash and collapse of oil prices.
1808 2018-05-30 20:45:16 I use bio oil & coco butter . I dnt need no more stretch marks lol
1809 2018-05-30 20:45:15 For example... 

"I'm allergic to gluten. It's VERY important you tell the chef."

"Ma'am the fries you ordered are made in oil that's also used for some gluten items. May I bring you something else instead?"

"Oh no... a little gluten is fine..."
1810 2018-05-30 20:45:14 My car is getting some new shoes today and next up is an oil change whenever i get done here  but i think my hair is gonna have to wait till next paycheck and I’m ok with that
1811 2018-05-30 20:45:06  Crude Oil Prices 
Wednesday (May 30th , 2018)
Markets  Closed 

 Brent $77.70
 WTI   $68.20

#Brent #WTI spread @ $9.50
1812 2018-05-30 20:44:54 Alberta’s oil has helped keep the Canadian economy going . We’re a resource based economy always have always will be.
1813 2018-05-30 20:44:47 Mixing in the oil on top of natural peanut butter makes me feel utterly incompetent
1814 2018-05-30 20:44:46 Yall do kno homie will have wayyyyy less maintenance in a '16 Altima.. Shit prob still under warranty too.. Lol.. Free oil changes too bih..
1815 2018-05-30 20:44:43 What state are you in? Can you not find a local "dealer"? They sell the oil ns well and the real stuff
1816 2018-05-30 20:44:38 Oil to $5!!! 
1817 2018-05-30 20:44:37  I know where I get my madness from... just casually sat here and a bio oil advert comes on and he just starts laughing and repeats bio oil... now we are just laughing about fucking bio oil what is wrong with us 
1818 2018-05-30 20:44:32 Nadia then in boy dey jam plus oil money wey i dey here. Trash
1819 2018-05-30 20:44:27 I’m tellin y’all, last night every time I had to swallow it woke me up because it hurt so bad. I drank three drops of oil of oregano in lemon water (tasted like shrimp scampi water ew) but my sore throat is gone! Sinus infection season...
1820 2018-05-30 20:44:25 I would have to agree with everything in that statement. These things can go nuts in either direction and become way oversold or way over bought.
1821 2018-05-30 20:44:21 I wish I was better at car maintenance. Like overall upkeep on a vehicle... taking it in for oil changes, not ignoring weird noises, etc.
1822 2018-05-30 20:44:21 Could always tell him how the dossier said Cohen went 2 Prague 2 meet Russians (never happened), how it said Page met Sechin 2 get a 19% stake in Russian oil when sanctions were lifted (why weren’t they, then? Page went on Fox-said it was a 30 sec exch of pleasantries in a hall!)
1823 2018-05-30 20:44:17 CBD oil legal here, not looking to get high. Pain relief.
1824 2018-05-30 20:44:16 There's quite a lot on the lack of marginal productivity proof, I think. Lots of stuff on CEO pay increasing more with chance events that benefit the company, like an oil price hike/fall, than their pay falls for similar bad luck etc etc.
1825 2018-05-30 20:44:15 Bitch you should’ve went to integrity 30$ the first time and you get a license plate for free oil changes after that 
1826 2018-05-30 20:44:03 @forgefirst In respect to your statement today about taking "Oil" out of this country.
Diluted Bitumen is NOT Oil. Trans Mountain Expansion is all about getting DilBit to America. They will make the spread between DilBit and Synthetic Crude.
1827 2018-05-30 20:43:42 Snark and ad hominem attacks do not sell your argument.
Further, you are running your test with the answer you want already formulated.
You know better than to run a drill down this way.
1828 2018-05-30 20:43:37 I've heard CBD oil can help. My sister swears by it for hip pain
1829 2018-05-30 20:43:35 "I CAN'T BE VEGAN BECAUSE LOCATION" I was vegan in a work camp in the oil sands, you're just making excuses.
1830 2018-05-30 20:43:13 @KKeefer120 the dealer that I get all my oil from sells maxima oil and I have a 2016 CRF250R what is the best oil that they offer to run in my bike is the pro plus any good?
1831 2018-05-30 20:43:03 You already look like a crockpot shined with baby oil bitch don’t be coming for mutherfuckin nicki Minaj
1832 2018-05-30 20:43:01 my vision is blurry and i cant tell if its bc im tired or bc i took my mascara off and i have remnants of oil
1833 2018-05-30 20:42:44 Im happy tomorrow is my off day, so I can finally organize my room clean out my car and get an oil change.
1834 2018-05-30 20:42:39 Iran won't be getting nuclear weapon.  They were better able to with Iran deal - their ships were loaded with oil & on the seas be4 Iran deal signed. That's their $s. If China agrees to buy lots of oil that helps them keep deal.
1835 2018-05-30 20:42:36 Looks like commies are on some kind of shopping spree.  #FuQTrudeau buying oil , these crazies are after hydro..
1836 2018-05-30 20:42:34 Oil is $77 today. It’s been marching up recently and was over $80 last week. Massive sulphur changes to maritime law in 2020 mean it will probably go over $100 in the next year. That will give Scotland more security to go it alone.
1837 2018-05-30 20:42:28 Note to self - Never support Nature’s Path Foods. A company willing to support the import of foreign oil from countries 200 years behind in women’s rights and export their own Env footprint to China (rare earth’s), to support their green initiatives, cannot be trusted.
1838 2018-05-30 20:42:28 For bank stocks... 10 year note fell lowest since April 12... dropped below 2.8%... Disney shares fell more than 2%... Oil futures: sharply lower as trades digs in Saudi Arabia and Russia to oil output... US crude lost $1.15,1.7%,$66.75,
1839 2018-05-30 20:42:27 Oooh my friend that is the sickest burn since the blazing of the oil fields in Kuwait
1840 2018-05-30 20:42:25 It’s interesting to hear the CEO of an oil company talk about the impacts US Policy (ie Iran) has on business, and openly praising electric vehicles. Sees China as a major competitors and potential policy change agents to vehicle markets. #MovinOnConf18
1841 2018-05-30 20:42:14 Then the gun freaks say no way we need 600 rounds per minute in case 600 bad guys per minute try and come in my door. Then the whole thing breaks down because not all parties agree there is an issue to solve. So we will ALL spend billions so 5% can keep their armalites.
1842 2018-05-30 20:42:12 Big Oil.
1843 2018-05-30 20:42:12 Hate to tell you but a majority of FN are against pipelines which do not help them, BC, or Canada. Protesters are using their constitutional rights to stand up against big oil, that something pipeline supporters want silenced. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #AlbertaBullies
1844 2018-05-30 20:42:11 I would NEVER have bought it if I knew it was a tanning oil we used. I hate myself so much
1845 2018-05-30 20:42:10 Is CBD oil legal in your state? It works wonders and although it is also a bit exspensive, a little goes a long way.
1846 2018-05-30 20:42:08 conveniently, changing the oil in our modern metaphor is almost literal
1847 2018-05-30 20:42:04 That Kat Von D tattoo lip liner does NOT clock out boy. Without oil this shit is an all day affair!
1848 2018-05-30 20:41:59 He annointest my head with oil.  My cup runneth over.  #Refreshedandburstingwithblessings.
1849 2018-05-30 20:41:54 Coconut palm oil, New York crude oil, Brent crude oil.
1850 2018-05-30 20:41:32 API Crude oil inventories:

Distillate: +1.466M
Cushing: -0.132M
1851 2018-05-30 20:41:30 — eat biotin-rich foods or take biotin pills
— do hot oil massages! basically just warm up any oil like coconut or casted oil and then massage it in ur scalp 
for 10-15 mins
— do not wash your hair everyday! (IG:lmaoselfcare)
1852 2018-05-30 20:41:10 Plugs, lean carb out if needed, filters, oil change, tires.
1853 2018-05-30 20:41:10 Oh of course, the African diet is carbs galore. Then there is the palm oil dishes lol
1854 2018-05-30 20:40:56 More Jesus encourages good behavior. One doesn't have to be religious to understand that those values are a good thing to follow. That doesn't mean I am saying let's all be religious militants. It just means that certain values should be valued and taught.
1855 2018-05-30 20:40:56 it's the world wide economic system that has taken over after WW2 when we were removed from the gold standard, where by all nations must by their oil supplies in US Dollars. no other currency can be exchanged for oil.
1856 2018-05-30 20:40:55 in the big picture of the human that's like junking a car because nobody bothered to change the oil. It took over a thousand years to get back what Rome lost.
1857 2018-05-30 20:40:48 But the massive state owned Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum will heed the govt guidance.
1858 2018-05-30 20:40:41 Listening to @MattWarner98 @Nathan_J_B and Shemek arguing about where different types of oil come from genuinely has me in stitches.
1859 2018-05-30 20:40:31 Need an oil change and new tires asap
1860 2018-05-30 20:40:26 She was utilizing the state-run oil company to develop Angola and build up a strong domestic economy. That's why big oil decided to go after her.

1862 2018-05-30 20:40:21 THE DEGENERATE DEMOCRAT SCUM POINT TO DJT RAISING GAS PRICES BY PUTTING THE SPITTLE SPEWING MULLAHS IN TEHRAN IN THE PENALTY BOX. JUST REMIND THEM: ANWR WILL BE PUMPING MORE OIL THAN THEY CAN USE BUT THE SCUM LEFTIST ARE BLOCKING THE OIL PRODUCTION THEN SCREAMING ABOUT THE PRICE
1863 2018-05-30 20:40:17 It's hard to read because the colours are all over the place, the fonts are horrible and the spacing of everything is way out, oh and that oil painting effect on the picture of the church is horrendous. Surely someone involved knows someone who can do it properly? No offence.
1864 2018-05-30 20:40:10 Get outta the oil squid 
1865 2018-05-30 20:40:10 Cristián de la Fuente
1866 2018-05-30 20:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1867 2018-05-30 20:39:57 The first step in fighting corruption is transparency, has the government made the oil sector transparent?
1868 2018-05-30 20:39:47 Caster oil in my brows & lavender in my hair.... That should be a biblical verse
1869 2018-05-30 20:39:47 I mean you’re pretty far from where you can get it but I’d send you a bottle, I use this oil that has like a fresh bonfire smell. I freaking love it but I’m a redneck lmao
1870 2018-05-30 20:39:40 Or at least some coco oil in his hair HAHA
1871 2018-05-30 20:39:36 Someone presents fact that they defended their farm, the way my family did, with only bolt action deer guns, pump action bird guns, and sidearms.. then we all turn to those with a gun fetish and say what do you think? Are you willing to give up your armalites?
1872 2018-05-30 20:39:35 If any Helicopters on the West side (Yakima) they could park them at Fairchild afb. They could move ground equipment by train to Spokane. But will the train tracks be viable in the return to the West side is "???".  If the tracks are shutdown, no more Oil Trains to the west coast
1873 2018-05-30 20:39:24 Imma go pick up some oil in bout a hour
1874 2018-05-30 20:39:19 We just got some new *Grease Monkey 1g by Hood Oil*
1875 2018-05-30 20:39:16 When you strive to continue the same old tired oil and coal scenario, you are not advocating for energy independence.  Fact.
1876 2018-05-30 20:39:11 I'll try that with my tins of olive oil if I remember.
1877 2018-05-30 20:39:01 you're gonna die from veggie oil
1878 2018-05-30 20:39:00 If #OIC is really sincere with the Palestinian cause, they should immediately bycot all the contries who stand by israel including US. All Arab countries should immediately stop selling their oil to such oppressors.
@OIC_OCI  Show some courage and dignity...
1879 2018-05-30 20:38:59 In terms of oil usage it's pretty good. However, will check to make sure oil cap has no mayo.
1880 2018-05-30 20:38:57 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.

1882 2018-05-30 20:38:49 they need some oil lots of oil
1883 2018-05-30 20:38:49 Fingers crossed, ME is such a hard thing for people to comprehend, 'just don't be so tired' seems to be the automatic response bleh. 
I really hope we can get some proper delving into marijuana, seems like cannabis oil works wonders with a lot of things

15. The operation is said to be to teach a lesson & put an end to protests, as many oil, port etc crony themes are planned by center. Sagarmala supposed to be 1 more. 

Many more info, but shared with you few. 
There's something fishy & high-handed in it.
1886 2018-05-30 20:38:21 Medusa’s no oil painting either. But I’d rather Raven’s pic of jubblies in a jar than a head in one 
1887 2018-05-30 20:38:21 Maybe not ...oil will the key in cannabis production ...much more diversified market
1888 2018-05-30 20:38:21 Oil ! Así pueden pagar lo que deben a AFIP
1889 2018-05-30 20:38:17 Run your 5 whys, or whatever you'd prefer. It boils down to people and poor choices.
Value added vs nva are often opinion and debatable, just like most other things.
1890 2018-05-30 20:38:15 humans & cars r almost identical
the heart of the human is similar to the engine in a car. the brain is the equivalent to the cars computer. we need food & water, just like cars need gas & oil to run. we need to take care of ourselves, so we don’t rust out & end up in a junkyard.
1891 2018-05-30 20:37:57 Syncrude cut 400 jobs in February through the use of automation, but please, continue to wax poetic about how the oil business is concerned about the loss of jobs around this useless pipeline.

1893 2018-05-30 20:37:50 @RahulGandhi @ShashiTharoor @surjitbhalla @Chellaney @Ram_Guha @sardesairajdeep Petrol/diesel prices should be pegged to the global oil prices. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The government cannot subsidize with money it doesn’t have and that it doesn’t collect by taxes.
1894 2018-05-30 20:37:48 I made them again and they turned out amazing! Used oil instead of the air fryer!

Siehe Oil Pressure. 
1897 2018-05-30 20:37:30 Haha! Not sure I agree. Remember we were ruled by Sweden and Denmark for 700 years. Then we found oil and we are fiercely independent now. We have been lucky relatively. They don’t call Sweden the most jealous country on earth for nothing 
1898 2018-05-30 20:37:24 ok hear me out instead of building a pipeline and banning plastic straws we put all the straws together and use them to suck the oil
1899 2018-05-30 20:37:22 Free oil changes for 3 Years is too lit 
1900 2018-05-30 20:37:19 Wow! That's marvelous - I must share with Beloved Daughter, who before she went into oil & gas in TX, taught me all I know re Paradise Lost. When I wrote tweet, I (entirely inexplicably) forgot about Khan. #StarTrek
1901 2018-05-30 20:37:18 Venezuela fell into what it is today not because of their social policies, but rather because they never diversified their economy relying only on the oil. This of course made their economy as a whole collapse with the collapse of the price of oil.
1902 2018-05-30 20:37:11 So...he is going to nationalize oil and gas production like Venezuela so he will not allow export and sales outside the U.S.? Otherwise......
1903 2018-05-30 20:37:11 Location matters.
1904 2018-05-30 20:37:10 ... So that being said - very soon we gonna bombard and invade Iran. They have lot of oil!  Under the flag of protecting our freedom, we are making it our oil!
1905 2018-05-30 20:37:07 RUSSIA is a Country that the only thing that keeps it afloat is its massive amount of OIL and GAS,that it sells to EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,  they don't produce a damn thing, thst tgey can ship out and,sell, a MAJORITY about o0% their FOOD is imported , when the old SOVIET UNION broke
1906 2018-05-30 20:37:05 I came to get an oil change and just got crop dusted by a redneck in the waiting room. Pissed
1907 2018-05-30 20:36:58 I think Ireland will eventually unite. So what. We should have left fully in 1921. Scotland cannot secede. It would be suicide. But if oil goes back to 200 - possible. Not sure about you but I’d say 20 is more likely than 200

1910 2018-05-30 20:36:37 Someone points out that muzzle velocity, fragment patterns, magazine/clip round counts, and rounds per minute are all factors to number killed during situation.  We discuss ways to reduce those specs and still allow Americans to defend themselves.

1916 2018-05-30 20:36:19 #MedicareForAll requires a reassessment of America's priorities. Tax corporations at 1950s rates. Cut ridiculous military spending. Stop giving money to oil&gas.

1925 2018-05-30 20:35:43 i would only use it if it was the last oil on earth
1926 2018-05-30 20:35:43 Yep! Same situation with products like AzureAD/O365. IMHO the alternatives are snake oil. Give me a good reason why not to use it. One that justifies the extra costs.
1927 2018-05-30 20:35:28 Look into CBD oil. My holistic doctor recommended it and I now sleep like a baby.
1928 2018-05-30 20:35:22 2/2 BMO: One quarter of data doesn’t warrant an all-clear, but it's a positive development. #NAFTA concerns & competitive challenges are headwinds, but they haven’t scared #investors away entirely; with #oil now meaningfully higher, we could see more activity in that sector

1932 2018-05-30 20:34:58 Lets remember your forecast about the oil backed yuan. It did not end the world as you forecasted. You like these extreme world ending, anarchic thought. These rarely happen in the real world.

1937 2018-05-30 20:34:31 Texas laws suck on this. They were recently thinking about trying to outlaw CBD oil. I'm in Houston and my senior dog takes it for his old age aches and pains and I take it for the pain from my 2 vertebrae that have slipped & are pressing on my spinal cord.
1938 2018-05-30 20:34:27 Alberta and the oil industry is cheering Trudeau. Andrew Scheer and you and the BC Government and the environmentalists are having an uneasy affair.
1939 2018-05-30 20:34:27 The West would never allow an African leader with the long term interest of his own people to remain in power. How else would they continue to exploit her for her resources? That's why Gadaffi is dead, Libya is in ruins & her oil flows West. You are sheep my friend.

1951 2018-05-30 20:33:06 First issue to deal with is why are so many Americans wanting to take their own life? Why are we at a point where self preservation is so low? That will solve 63% of our problem with gun deaths. The next step, is violence itself. Why are we not valuing life as much as we should?

2012 2018-05-30 20:28:08 Yep, the oil came from the age of dinosaurs,and when we are rid of the current "dinosaurs" mostly in the political right,then we'll move onward a future that will follow the natural path countries like Germany have blazed,,efficient cheap energy,localized grids.
2013 2018-05-30 20:28:07 @nikkihaley @elonmusk Then Humans Not Try none oil using transport   So is oil us connected to war ?
2014 2018-05-30 20:28:06 i started taking these fish oil pills. i'm def feeling a little discriminatory against salmon...
2015 2018-05-30 20:27:17 I think I'm more worried about how much oil & coolant my 156 might use next week, rather than worrying about normal issues. #LakeDistrict
2016 2018-05-30 20:27:17 had to happen eventually, car manufacturers have got away with terrible emissions for yonks & Oz is a dumping ground, the oil industry might not win this one, Europe the key, then China imo
2017 2018-05-30 20:27:09 It was shrewd of Bin Laden to attack us, drawing us into a conflict where we must respond in order to protect our interests (or our albatrosses depending on one's point of view) in the region: oil and Israel.
2018 2018-05-30 20:27:03 I wish they would just let me nap in my backseat while they change my oil.
2019 2018-05-30 20:26:58 #oott WTI Midland Texas spread $17+ .... WTI(Cushing)/Brent spread $9.55+... The tale of Permian output capacity being reached is being reflected in WTI Midland and WTI Cushing pricing. Expect increased US exports of light shale output to Asia. Imports of heavy oil high ...

2021 2018-05-30 20:26:44 Coconut oil is the best kind of sorcery
2022 2018-05-30 20:26:41 Bacon, use lots of coconut oil in stuff, avocados, nuts.
2023 2018-05-30 20:26:38 That is interesting. Do you have access to cannabis oil? I would begin a dosing regimen
2024 2018-05-30 20:26:37 Are we ready to discuss what things we can do as a nation to reduce the 33,000 dead outlier that is America? I am. If you are not fine. I am a data driven root cause finding engineer. To attack this first step should be data collection from govt source we all agree is accurate

2026 2018-05-30 20:26:30 Its garlic chilly and olive oil
2027 2018-05-30 20:26:21 Huh, in your reality, it’s almost like oil being half the price has nothing to do with business decisions and justifications...
2028 2018-05-30 20:26:07 Best wishes and welcome to Oil&Gas industry. Keep rocking and keep running.
2029 2018-05-30 20:26:06 I saw through @JustinTrudeau from day one. He is the Donald Trump of Canada. Now the whole world can see him for what he is. #oil #tarsands #Canada #Trump #climate
2030 2018-05-30 20:26:02 That is awesome and good to know! I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil and it works for me, but I’ve had no need to use it on my dog yet.
2031 2018-05-30 20:25:59 @GeorgeWBush__ and Mr. Bush dont tell me you were not in Detroit, Michigan really you were an owner of the Texas Rangers and good friends with the owner of the Detroit Tigers. Just remember what happened to Charles Henry Wilson (Airhead), how could you forget,the oil portrait?
2032 2018-05-30 20:25:56 Carter had it right. Reliance on oil was going to bite us in the ass geopolitically & environmentally. The US had a choice to respond w/ conservation (Carter) or accelerate our conspicuous consumption (Reagan) w/ unbridled capitalism. This isn’t hindsight. I remember the choice.
2033 2018-05-30 20:25:44 gotta take her for an oil change tho
2034 2018-05-30 20:25:43 #FED #LibroBeige:

- Actividad económica mostró expansión moderada entre #abril y #mayo, por lo tanto la #FED, seguiría subindo la #tasa próximo mes.

- A pesar de incremento de costos de algunas materias primas como #oil y #acero, presiones inflacionarias aún parecen moderadas.
2035 2018-05-30 20:25:43 Paid for unnecessaty testing. And let's not forget the thousands spent on unnecessary 'decontamination'. Someone got paid for that too. Snake oil.
2036 2018-05-30 20:25:40 Actually, people get shot will bullets, beanbags & other such projectiles. 

I’m not aware of one firearm ever being shot into someone, either by themselves or another party. 

A few people are assaulted by a firearm & some do die from the blunt force trauma, mainly to the brain.
2037 2018-05-30 20:25:25 Headline should read “Trump signs bill allowing return of snake oil salesmen”
2038 2018-05-30 20:25:25 @nikkihaley   Then educated Figure Treason Since 38. OK Then. Oil people don’t Feed there other Cousins after meal. Oil. 96%

2041 2018-05-30 20:25:07 I love almond oil , works better for me
2042 2018-05-30 20:25:05 It now also appears that Notley has lost the option of using her new legislation unless Trudeau agrees to stop transfers of oil to BC via #KMX.

2047 2018-05-30 20:24:44 Need to get my hair done. Need to go to the chiropractor. Need to get an oil change. Need a job 
2048 2018-05-30 20:24:39 Don’t give them any ideas. Next thing you know there’s a $50 mil study on turning oil into drinkable water.
2049 2018-05-30 20:24:29 Is it me or did Konstantine disappear from the convo? Guess he forgot about gang crime in Cali

2052 2018-05-30 20:24:17 Minute this gov bought pipeline to send oil  through a very long pipeline, to a pristine coast,to then be loaded onto tankers to then be shipped along that preistine coastline,YOU lost your right to claim You are  not a gov for enviornment. You are a gov for the economy first.
2053 2018-05-30 20:24:14 @CPC_HQ are acting like arrogant bigots as they claim a majority of FN support pipelines and this is good for Canada. And they are also bashing NDP and pipeline protesters. It is a no brainer, pipelines benefit no one but big oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #CarbonTax

2058 2018-05-30 20:23:49 Crude oil is now $75.5 per barrel in the world market.
2059 2018-05-30 20:23:40 She’s an oil painting.... beautiful to look at, but there’s nothing behind it....
2060 2018-05-30 20:23:37 Plus, having lived in that neighbourhood, I can't imagine a worse place to build a major oil terminal.  It's a giant FU to the people of Vancouver.
2061 2018-05-30 20:23:36 Hanna came to get an oil change & we’ve been waiting for over an hour. So she went to go ask what was taking so long & they told her they couldn’t find her car! LMAO #WHERESLOLA 
2062 2018-05-30 20:23:34 Now desperate people will be scammed by snake oil salesman
2063 2018-05-30 20:23:23 paulita.. disculpa q piense distinto a vos.. y compare en algo a este gobierno con el anterior.. la ex presidente VETO el 82% movil d los jubilados.. permitio q Oil evadiera o dejara de pagar 8000millones d Pesos .. las encuestan no sirven ni son reflejo dnda
2064 2018-05-30 20:23:20 Clarification: Marine oil spill response is regulated  (rather than controlled) by @Transport_gc (TC). @MarineResponse is the sole Response Organisation (RO) certified by TC on the BC coast. @CoastGuardCAN acts either as Federal Response Officer (FMO) or On Scene Commander (OSC).
2065 2018-05-30 20:23:16 People need to take care of their cars  you wonder why your car broke down on the highway but you haven’t had oil change in a year???

He is traveling the world like an insurance seals man selling snack oil
2069 2018-05-30 20:22:41 There are two types in this world, people who oil their wood, and people who don't.... That's not a euphemism 
2070 2018-05-30 20:22:32 In Seattle the oil change is $9, but the tax is $102. :-)
2071 2018-05-30 20:22:25 i have to go home today and change my car oil
2072 2018-05-30 20:22:25 I really don’t get the issue with Offset buying him a Nissan. No car payments, low financial maintenance, good on gas, affordable car parts, affordable oil changes, etc. People’s mindset kill me.
2073 2018-05-30 20:22:19 Oil changed, grocery shopping, and not I’m at the doctors office. 
2074 2018-05-30 20:22:13 Lmao there is oil
2075 2018-05-30 20:22:10 Newsflash, the planet depends on this industry. Oil consumption has only gone up as people like you have been blabbing for divestment. It’s nearly 100 million barrels, PER DAY! The problem with your rhetoric is that you don’t even begin conversations in the real world.
2076 2018-05-30 20:22:10 In the face of a jam that wouldn't dislodge, I finally broke down and tried the oil-on-the-filament 3D printing extruder fix.  It works! We have extrusion.  Beats taking it apart or purchasing a new one.
2077 2018-05-30 20:22:04 Bake for 8 minutes, or until thick and sliced gherkins and arrange them in a hot oil.
2078 2018-05-30 20:21:58 OK, what different laws will prevent gun crimes?
2079 2018-05-30 20:21:55 I am thinking of making a batch of Essential oil mosquito spray samples, anyone intersted in them? I can have them ready after the weekend.
2080 2018-05-30 20:21:43 In a letter to the UAE's energy min ( currently opec's president) Iran's oil minister said some members of the group have been making statements that might be perceived as official position opec, which needs to be avoided. #OOTT
2081 2018-05-30 20:21:36 Key facts
Canada is the 4th largest producer and 3rd largest exporter of oil in the world
97% of Canada’s proven oil reserves are located in the oil sands
99% of Canada’s oil exports go to the U.S.
GHG emissions per barrel produced from oil sands have fallen over 35% since 1990

2089 2018-05-30 20:20:32 Hi David, This product uses highly refined peanut oil. The supplier has provided thorough documentation that confirms highly refined peanut oil is non-allergenic.
2090 2018-05-30 20:20:23 The numbers Canadians need to hear repeatedly are the tax dollars we are loosing daily by selling our land locked oil only to the USA market and how much we feed to the middle east for their oil...
2091 2018-05-30 20:20:20 RE: prison guards involvement in prison reform mtgs: Sure & big pharma should have a say in how hospitals are run.. Beef farmers should have a say in the food pyramid.. Oil companies should help create policy for solar power mandates. Wait...
2092 2018-05-30 20:20:15 CBD oil.  it's pricey - but not too bad.
2093 2018-05-30 20:19:55 @ShannonStubbsMP is bashing oil pipeline protesters and the NDP and claiming that they are responsible for Alberta's woes. Oil does not help Canada as a whole. A majority of FN are opposed to pipelines. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #AlbertaBullies #KeepItInTheGround

What's good 4 the goose is good 4 the gander!Low/mid class small tax breaks will be eaten up by high gas prices! Big oil companies got huge tax cuts,seems that wasn't enough ! GREEDY!
2097 2018-05-30 20:19:25 Government is increase the Prices oil because of this reason only.

2103 2018-05-30 20:18:57 Low insurance.
Low maintenance costs.

Like homes: buying a vehicle isn't the most expensive part; its the upkeep/maintenance.

If he was walking prior, doubt he could afford the damn oil changes on a BMW/Benz/Audi/Tesla/Bentley.
2104 2018-05-30 20:18:51 lol
2105 2018-05-30 20:18:44 Doesn’t matter. The right to bear arms supersedes the privilege to drive cars. All other genuflecting to sophistry means nothing.
2106 2018-05-30 20:18:41 My inspection expires tomorrow. Desperate times, etc. Went to a local guy who got me right in for the low, low price of $111 for oil change/inspection.

2109 2018-05-30 20:18:28 Iran Oil Min: won't accept limitations on its oil exports
 Asks UAE energy minister to discuss US sanctions on Iran at the June OPEC meeting. Asks also for support against illegal US sanctions.
 Iran will return to its normal share of oil market after US sanctions resolved
2110 2018-05-30 20:18:21 Global Corporations like General Electric, Disney, Microsoft and Chevron Oil also control our political leaders!
2111 2018-05-30 20:18:12 you’re right!! all citrus fruits and citrus essential oils cause photosensitivity, and it’s one of the last things you want to put on your face just like coconut oil, even though it may clear your skin
2112 2018-05-30 20:18:12 Wow looks strong enough for oil tanker trucks, if not tanks!

Fuck Putin
2113 2018-05-30 20:18:01 What about #canada being far too economically dependent on #oilandgas export revenues?  #Venezuela under President #Maduro has seen its economy go belly-up because after the price of #oil #plummet|ted, the @GobiernoVE  had no plan to wean that country off its oil-exporting ways.
2114 2018-05-30 20:18:00 You know it’s hot when your coconut oil in your cabinet is completely in liquid form
2115 2018-05-30 20:17:53 Trump has done many great good things since becoming President. However the oil companies are very dishonest, the HIGH gas prices prove it.
2116 2018-05-30 20:17:42 i've gotten my first commission to do a portrait in oil paint from them seeing my black n white portrait of my boyfriend !!! how exciting
2117 2018-05-30 20:17:42 He just cut American taxes at the cost to big oil. They’d probably off him if he attempted to liberate the US in its entirety.
2118 2018-05-30 20:17:33 My bad for thinking the staff should be focused on more important issues today (or even the positives of last nights rally) rather than trying to throw oil on a grease fire.  What is the ultimate motive?  Working together for good of Country or continue fight w/ media?
2119 2018-05-30 20:17:32 Edmonton Oil with many tax payers $$$$ behind it
2120 2018-05-30 20:17:19 Not sure what you are asking - I live in west Texas. We do have healthcare providers though they are a bit sparse especially when our populations swells during oil rig drilling boom times. I had my own insurance (self-emplyed) and finally had to go thru Marketplace
2121 2018-05-30 20:17:16 Yeah I wrote this for simplicity and taste. Also BCoffe is def higher grade coffe then most other stuff you can find. I use ghee butter and mct oil
2122 2018-05-30 20:17:12 Exactly, I accidentally overdosed on some marijuana oil. Lol! That was just truth serum for me. Two hours straight on the phone with my brother and my friend. Laughing, crying and spilling my guts out. No racist rants here either. Ridiculous!
2123 2018-05-30 20:17:10 are you saying that spicy mayo and avocado oil mayo are equivalent? do you need your sushi privileges evoked?
2124 2018-05-30 20:17:05 CBD oil is legal, affordable, & has the same properties of those pills. It metabolizes faster also, because there are no fillers to control absorption rate or to have a reaction to.
2125 2018-05-30 20:17:01 Lmfao its cheaper & saves money to eat whole foods & it saves lots of money in medical bills. yeah its mental illness we ignore the fact we eat tortured raped animals & steal their babies. & soak them in oil and herbs and eat it with a smile. but then claim anti animal cruelty
2126 2018-05-30 20:16:55 My only argument is how much we have spent to make them safer vs guns. For example the S&W smart gun research which NRA shit on. I said nothing about one being a privilege and the other a right. Read the string. canned comments are rarely value added
2127 2018-05-30 20:16:42 US Closing prices: #DOW 1.26% #NASDAQ 0.72% #Ftse100 0.75% #GBPUSD 1.328 #EURGBP 0.878 #EURUSD 1.1661 #Gold 0.01% #Oil 0.24%
2128 2018-05-30 20:16:36 It’s just a natural oil that has tons of uses. The main one is drinking it as a natural laxative lol, but it’s a life saver for brows and lashes
2129 2018-05-30 20:16:28 It’s not good. It basically takes away regulations of what is an experimental treatment whereas previously the FDA oversaw experimental treatments. Makes terminally ill people susceptible to snake oil and unregulated treatments that can make things worse.
2130 2018-05-30 20:16:21 store. I say may, because there might be a lot more to that med, you have to research. But if the rest is generic and this is what makes it costly, you can decarboxylate and steep your own in coconut oil, make Rick Simpson's oil, buy legal CBD oil with no mess. At least that's
2131 2018-05-30 20:16:19 Bloody stunning, try them sashimi with a little soy, ginger, sesame oil, chilli lime and coriander!! Absolutely fantastic
2132 2018-05-30 20:16:15 I hate getting my oil changed because they always try to sell me on what I “need”. JUST THE OIL CHANGE PLEASE
2133 2018-05-30 20:16:11 I love truffle oil
2134 2018-05-30 20:16:07 Same. Gonna smoke then stroke myself with some coconut oil 
2135 2018-05-30 20:16:06 @Bill_Morneau is negotiating the purchase and sale of an oil pipeline. He is a used mutual fund salesman that is is terribly underqualified as finance minister. We are doomed. Taxpayers will lose again.
2136 2018-05-30 20:16:04 So buy him a bag bro!! Or Rick Simpson Oil!
2137 2018-05-30 20:16:02 Great point. My nephew is Army and can barely make ends meet. Where is the Money going? Not to the people fighting and dying. Not to the VETS who have a high suicide rate. To contractors and big oil.
2138 2018-05-30 20:15:58 Maybe cbd oil?
2139 2018-05-30 20:15:51 Check your Engine oil today.
2140 2018-05-30 20:15:50 Yes CBD oil is amazing. I have 65% nerve damage my whole left side. If it wasn't for this the helping my pain it would be off the charts. So sorry for your dad. There are many options. Go and have a conversation with your local dispensary. They are very helpful.
2141 2018-05-30 20:15:46 Whip together 2 cups cereal with 4 tsps daily bread. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve
2142 2018-05-30 20:15:42 Hey but I'm a cool and lazy mom, like I'm cooking and while oil heats and stuff in sitting on a chair while tweeting this

2144 2018-05-30 20:15:17 Love having a car.. until I need to pump gas or pay for an oil change
2145 2018-05-30 20:15:17 Well thought strategy by BJP. Oil companies  allowed to earn more now & closer to elections they will have to cut rates for BJP win
2146 2018-05-30 20:15:14 $50 for an oil change

2148 2018-05-30 20:15:11 Pssst. They can buy CBD vape oil & replace the juice in their pods. There’s a video on opening Juul pods. I’ve done it.

2150 2018-05-30 20:15:07 The US rig count is on a tear. 

After crossing above 1,000 rigs during early April, total activity between April 6 & May 25 increased by 55 rigs (51 oil; 4 gas)

33 of those rigs are in the Permian, reflecting what a behemoth the Texas/New Mexico shale play has become.
2151 2018-05-30 20:15:05 Doing the weekly shop and thinking that of course, it was only ever a matter of time before they put coconut oil in toilet roll
2152 2018-05-30 20:15:01 Again you are lying @ShannonStubbsMP. #EnergyEast was not nation building. No other province wanted the pipeline. Here is the truth, Alberta and @CPC_HQ need to accept that oil is holding Canada back. We to to diversify to #RenewableEnergy. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
2153 2018-05-30 20:15:00 sautéed lightly in olive oil with fresh garlic! perfect 
2154 2018-05-30 20:14:58 i'm cleansing myself of my sins through vigorous olive oil scrubbings
2155 2018-05-30 20:14:50 Better not have leaked oil on the car park !!… 
2156 2018-05-30 20:14:47 $WTI #crude #oil prices snapped their seven-day losing streak to settle higher following a report #OPEC and its allies would stick to the global production-cut agreement.

@cbcnews needs to expose @fordnation snake oil.

2159 2018-05-30 20:14:44 Gas price in Erbil: 720 IRD
Gas price in Mosul: 450 IRD
That is how the so called KRG takes out money from our pockets, they do everything to keep their business running. All the oil business is owned by the tow ruling families. No one can compete or invest without their ties!
2160 2018-05-30 20:14:43 No opposition in life is there to burn the midnight oil in the wilderness, maybe you show as one.

2165 2018-05-30 20:14:16 What’s the oercapita rate?
2166 2018-05-30 20:14:15 @AmitShah, i have an idea to reduce fuel price to half without affecting the revenue generation and protecting oil companies interest.

2170 2018-05-30 20:14:00 Coconut oil, man.
2171 2018-05-30 20:13:49 I know that brother! But it is going to be in 100's here this weekend, so I will be bathing in peppermint oil! 
2172 2018-05-30 20:13:49 Gotta say, CBD oil so far has been a winner for me. I got a fun trifecta of mild ADHD and OCD, and a bit spicier-than-mild anxiety and it truly does keep the edge off without any added side effects that I've noticed.
2173 2018-05-30 20:13:47 How much of America do the Sudies own? How much stock was bought with our oil blackmail money? Wish I could sell my neighbours potatoes for $1,000 each (not) so I could buy their home. Foreign countries should not be allowed to own America.
2174 2018-05-30 20:13:44 This might work for 100 or so companies, but what about the 1000+ electric utilities in the US, the number of oil, gas, water orgs and utilities...at that point you’ve increased the number of folks and size of network that it’s security is effectively useless
2175 2018-05-30 20:13:32 Finally gonna learn to paint with oil based paint 
2176 2018-05-30 20:13:26 Try CBD oil....if you want, I can send you a DM
2177 2018-05-30 20:13:25 Go to the nearest state where it is legal and buy the edibles---like gummy candy with cannibis oil infused in it.  Has to be a reputable weed dealer in St. Louis MO.
2178 2018-05-30 20:13:15 At one time, hemp was such a useful crop that farmers were required to grow some. Then the oil industry saw hemp as competition, so they cooked up a campaign against marijuana and got the government to ban it. The government did not realize that they were outlawing hemp.

2181 2018-05-30 20:13:03 how much of this is due to the decline in the oil price and the loss of industry due to the appreciation of the REAL during the boom years prior.
2182 2018-05-30 20:13:03 No mention of destruction of ancient rainforests which become palm oil plantations causing massive wildlife habitat and biodiversity loss (as replaced by monoculture) on a massive scale.. Kindly confirm if your definition of ‘forest’ here includes such palm plantations?
2183 2018-05-30 20:12:59 I have struck oil
2184 2018-05-30 20:12:54 None of these are unconstitutional; driving is a privilege, NOT a right. This is a false equivalence argument.

2189 2018-05-30 20:12:16 @NPR 

If you guys are so anti Trump, why won't you or any NPR shows invite Al Gore on to discuss global warming and recent climate disasters? Oh, forgot, NPR sponsored by Koch Brothers and oil rich Saudis.
2190 2018-05-30 20:12:07 Not crazy about the Uber ads. I mean just how much have they improved? Are they letting their employees organize. Oh wait they’re not employees, they’re “independent contractors” using their own cars, has, oil, insurance. Do a piece on just HOW Uber has changed. Thx.
2191 2018-05-30 20:12:02 Unless, of course, the market for our oil collapses, in which case Aaron's will sound more like a prophetic voice of caution.

2195 2018-05-30 20:11:17 @republic @IndiaToday Media can use the oil crisis to help Con gressi. But people are mature enough to understand.
2196 2018-05-30 20:11:15 Carry on.  
Turning 28 you should have things figured out somewhat. Happy belated Birthday. #MAGA #BeBest
2197 2018-05-30 20:11:14 Sorry @ShannonStubbsMP, but pipelines have NOT favored FN or Canadians as a whole. Oil and gas only favors Alberta and big oil companies profits. Most FN are against #TarSands, and there was no consultation on #kindermorgan. Check your facts. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
2198 2018-05-30 20:11:06 Oando and northwest oil
2199 2018-05-30 20:11:01 I agree about growing clean energy capacity. But oil by rail just seems so risky. Why wouldn't we want a safer alternative?
2200 2018-05-30 20:10:57 melaleuca (tea tree oil) and cedarwood work well for me! also your moisturizer impacts how oily your skin is. i recommend using rose oil or jojoba oil (what i use) and it leaves your skin glowing
2201 2018-05-30 20:10:47 Sometimes there are reasons for the madness. Other times there is just Joe to blame for why the barn smells like baby oil.
2202 2018-05-30 20:10:45 @WBUR if you guys are so anti Trump, why won't you or any NPR shows invite Al Gore on to discuss global warming and recent climate disasters? Oh, forgot, NPR sponsored by Koch Brothers and oil rich Saudis.
2203 2018-05-30 20:10:40 Hey sir, @beynate , great to see Bill 262 pass, let's keep it moving! Now can you also explain why you spent $4.5 billion on oil and not $3 billion on clean water? #INDIGENOUS rights.
2204 2018-05-30 20:10:39 One of very few things @JustinTrudeau and @Bill_Morneau actually got right. If we don’t ship oil someone else will. Far too many benefits to far too many Canadians to let it go to waste like many poverty advocates aka @BCGreens advocate !!
2205 2018-05-30 20:10:36 No joke.
Does anybody still fall for @fordnation snake oil?

2207 2018-05-30 20:10:23 Truck drivers can’t drive 24 hours straight that is a relatively new law. Mandatory seat belts is kinda new, helmet mandatory. Changing speed limit down for safety is not a new law but is a changed law
2208 2018-05-30 20:10:22 Both. safer cars: billions spent. Safer roads: Reflecting signs, those bumps that wake you up, stoplights, drivers test, rest areas, one way roads, liability insurance, roundabouts, automation of traffic flow, construction zones, speed limits, merge lanes, medians, street lights

Tried to give my dad the Holland & Barrett CBD oil for his Leukaemia pain, but he said it tasted like I was trying to poison him. Honestly I thought it would cover the taste of the arsenic, but I guess not - kidding! He didn't rate it

2217 2018-05-30 20:09:18 We would need to transport refined oil by pipeline
2218 2018-05-30 20:09:12 Great!!
2219 2018-05-30 20:09:11 Not only that but many 2nd-3rd gen work in oil/gas industry. These drivers and rig workers are conservative and don’t care much about immigration or gun control etc
2220 2018-05-30 20:09:00 Oil has been pressured by reports that the OPEC and Russia may ease up on output cuts in  place since January 2017. The cuts have driven down global inventories  and boosted prices, with global benchmark Brent reaching a 3-1/2-year  high of $80.50 a barrel on May 17.
2221 2018-05-30 20:08:58 Right! I just knew it would be a Camry. You can drive those shits into infinity and beyond on one oil change. 
2222 2018-05-30 20:08:57 The political unrest is being fuelled by Russian disinformation. Putin is funding Far Right political groups to destabilise and topple the EU, not for our benefit but for his own. He doesn’t want another super power on his doorstep sanctioning his oil and gas pipelines. @J_amesp

2225 2018-05-30 20:08:39 Good advise about the pressure gauge, Im thinking of installing one inside the cab, in the old days it was an easy job, all my old cars had them, along with the uprated oil pump, easy on the old Ford 4 pots 
2226 2018-05-30 20:08:37 One of his “kids” must be about to enter the snake oil business...either that or Trump Hospital is on its way.
2227 2018-05-30 20:08:36 Go to Gandhi Baba road with OIL bowl and Mat.. @RoshanKrRai u will defiantly get all your answers 
2228 2018-05-30 20:08:35 Many weeds can be eaten, used to flavour vodka, steeped in oil for skincare - rewilding should also be appreciated for the wonderful opportunities it affords us for virtually no effort

2230 2018-05-30 20:08:26 Subsidise healthcare... find a way. That's why everyone is running to pastors for miracles. It's cheaper to buy anointing oil and fast. My opinion though.
2231 2018-05-30 20:08:22 GNC Triflex part of our B2G1 sale going on through June 6th along with GNC Triple strength fish oil to help inflammation which is also part of the B2G1 sale
2232 2018-05-30 20:08:19 I'm so sorry about your dad, David. Medical mj is legal in your state. Pls consider inhalable, edible, or CBD oil for his relief. Blessings to you both.
2233 2018-05-30 20:07:45 Vit C and good basic B supplement. 

Also Veg EPA, plenty of coconut oil and milk. I seem to be existing on meat olives and coconut products. Not sure this is good long term but can’t live with such severe reactions from other foods that change regularly.
2234 2018-05-30 20:07:37 My mother in law uses old oil,she just keeps it in the pan and keeps reusing it  does the best pudding and chips though 
2235 2018-05-30 20:07:33 My husband also has his.  Our Sheriff says he passes them out like candy!
2236 2018-05-30 20:07:33 Soc-oil-ism! Better crude than screwed!
2237 2018-05-30 20:07:32 The reason people eat animals & their secretions is for pure fun & taste in this country. Try again, that is choosing to harm animals for your tastebuds & so you can grill it with sauce, oil & herbs. Mental illness.

2241 2018-05-30 20:07:25 hey! I am working on getting better at oil painting. If you have a thing in mind & don't mind waiting ~2 weeks for me to make it, I'd be psyched to try my hand at something! (fair warning: I can draw/paint animals & landscapes, but people are beyond me)
2242 2018-05-30 20:07:22 Must be Ambien in the oil they are burning, but then what made them show up, before they got their special torches and oil.
2243 2018-05-30 20:07:14 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

2248 2018-05-30 20:07:00 A smug snake oil salesman that makes videos for a joke of a news organization passing judgement on a drug company for “virtue signaling” while not saying a bad thing about the hordes of imbeciles who spent the last 24 hours defending Roseanne’s tweet. That’s dumber
2249 2018-05-30 20:07:00 Oil prices climbed surged on Wednesday, rebounding from a four-day slump  as Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply  and analysts forecast a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.
2250 2018-05-30 20:06:44 Cardio is far less efficient than weight training, in terms of increasing metabolism. 1 chicken breast? you might as well just go full keto, put some coconut oil in your coffee.
2251 2018-05-30 20:06:40 LITERALLY yesterday I was so depressed that I almost cried over the thought of having to mix AN egg and oil for waffles so I said fuck it and made lucky charms that didn’t have enough marshmallows which made me . more depressed. Thank you for coming to my ted talk
2252 2018-05-30 20:06:39 He certainly had the pro-Israel credentials and a strong enough relationship with Golda Meir to convince her to take some of Sadat’s overtures more seriously. If he was successful, then that butterflies away the Yom Kippur War, the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, and stagflation.
2253 2018-05-30 20:06:29 my uncle came woke me up outta my sleep to go get my oil changed like nigga why you just ain’t take the car
2254 2018-05-30 20:06:24 Thank you! Somehow every time this happens I forget that cloves and clove oil exist.
2255 2018-05-30 20:06:23 If prices on crude oil grows.. 
Mean time respecting mother worshipping god.. can't win over again.. people still waiting for achee din.. prices because of petroleum becoming dearer..
2256 2018-05-30 20:06:20 $60 oil change omg im ready to get a new carrrr
2257 2018-05-30 20:06:20 #1 sign is that energy problem is about to be solved.  Solve oil and you unplug the Global Elites ship.  Get 80-95% of the fuel gone and energy becomes less than 5% of products, not the current 25%

2259 2018-05-30 20:05:43 I assumed that of  your issues with Disney's version of the Muppets, their withdrawal from Chil-Fil-A and vilifying helpless oil tycoons probably weren't among them.
2260 2018-05-30 20:05:42 Well for instance the light went on 2 months ago on a road trip. Needed an oil change anyway, so I took it in. Mechanic looked everything over & changed oil. Light went away.
ON THE WAY HOME it came back on. Took it back in, mechanic computer-checked it, had no idea why it's on.
2261 2018-05-30 20:05:40 I need someone to clip my toenails, file them, and massage my toes with warm coconut oil.
2262 2018-05-30 20:05:33 I heard there is a dry hopped with hop oil in it tohether
2263 2018-05-30 20:05:23 The amount you would be bringing is not a big damn deal. You can get TBD oil online but if you can cross state lines go get some edibles which would be much more effective in treating the pain!!!! Plus helps with appetite and nausea ...
2264 2018-05-30 20:05:18 He is working. He's promoting the oil and gas industry that pays his bills.
2265 2018-05-30 20:05:11 Looks like Indian oil should run India.
2266 2018-05-30 20:05:11 Ditto!
2267 2018-05-30 20:05:10 Went to get an oil change at Walmart and spent $138 wtf..
2268 2018-05-30 20:05:02 Note to self: massage oil may work great for me because I have a hard time getting any color but don’t put it on and then go spend 4 hours on the lake in 85 degree weather because I’m  beyond fried
2269 2018-05-30 20:05:01 Wow, all that from one drop of oil. Utterly amazing.
2270 2018-05-30 20:04:51 I would live to see an all out battle between the snowflake envirotards vs. oil workers. Someone would be running to their safe places and it wouldn't be the oil workers. LOL
2271 2018-05-30 20:04:36 Look for bulletproof coffee, there are versions with regular coffee, butter and coconut oil
2272 2018-05-30 20:04:33 I’ve heard good things about meadowfoam seed oil. I like this one!
2273 2018-05-30 20:04:25 Many arm themselves outside school. Why not on campus? Nobody is forcing them and the #2nd should cover majority of daily life
2274 2018-05-30 20:04:21  That is shocking!! Congratulations! My wife and I have ours, but living in OH that's not too big of a Deal. If you aren't aware of Mr. Branca, PLEASE check him out! His motto is "You carry a gun to be hard to kill, know the Law to be hard to Convict".

2275 2018-05-30 20:04:07 One of my favorite ways to prepare chicken is to dry brine and then rotisserie. I stuff it with ginger, garlic, toasted sesame oil, shallots and a tangerine. Then make up an awesome glaze of honey, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Oh so good.

2278 2018-05-30 20:03:56 Cardinals bullpen is an issue just like last year.  Tried to fix with Holland, didn’t work out and now it’s leaking oil.  Just blew a nice comeback and now the game is over and we’ll leave Milwaukee 5 games out.  Disappointing.  #Hader. No way this offense scores off Best closer
2279 2018-05-30 20:03:31 I agree. Someone is doing everything they can to orchestrate ww3

On Syria- thats a conundrum I can't figure out. Unless it's just about an oil pipeline to Europe
& will it be Russia or Saudi Arabia sending oil thru?

Don't think there was ever an actual gas attack. You?
2280 2018-05-30 20:03:25 And not by much at that.
2281 2018-05-30 20:03:25 To maintain my “day 3-4 greasy curl” look... I put coconut oil in my hair before I wash it...that way my curls stay curly and not like a day-one frizz fiasco
2282 2018-05-30 20:03:22 I really feel like my Hair is coming along really nicely. I tried the LOC method yesterday and today my hair is soft as it ever been. I used water castor oil and ORS Hair Lotion. Great combination!!!
2283 2018-05-30 20:03:15 Gradual recovery in investment is not so subtle code for a need for higher prices to allow for continued capex. Talk of end to production cuts was meant to avoid spike to $100 not push oil down to $60. No doubt Saudis happy their mere mention of cuts has negated need for action.
2284 2018-05-30 20:03:15 Because capitalism has never lead to deaths. Especially if you don’t count oil, diamond and gold wars, poisoned environments, poor work conditions, slavery etc.
2285 2018-05-30 20:03:13 I put some oil on at 8:00 and it’s still very strong
2286 2018-05-30 20:03:12 Privileged to confirm that Africa's top oil & gas lawyer NJ Ayuk has agreed to give a talk to Uganda young lawyers on Tue 5th June at 7 pm. Event will be @The_Techhub 7th Floor Park Royal Building. Details to follow. NJ is listed by Forbes among 10 most powerful men in Africa
2287 2018-05-30 20:03:06 Try enforcing the laws before changing them.
2288 2018-05-30 20:03:03 What different law do we need?  How many ways can you say it is illegal to commit murder?
2289 2018-05-30 20:03:01 CBD oil. Research it. The oil is what they give children to limit seizures. And there's minimal to no THC. It is worth a shot, and without THC is less expensive.
2290 2018-05-30 20:03:00 The cynic in me says PMJT understands the Liberals need the revenues from the oil and gas industry for a few more years to pay for all those progressive promises.
2291 2018-05-30 20:02:40 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2292 2018-05-30 20:02:33 Psalm 104:14-15 New International Version (NIV)
14 He makes grass grow for the cattle,
    and plants for people to cultivate—
    bringing forth food from the earth:
15 WINE that gladdens human hearts,
    oil to make their faces shine,
    and bread that sustains their hearts.
2293 2018-05-30 20:02:29 Olive oil and vinegar is the best salad dressing end of discussion
2294 2018-05-30 20:02:20 Trade, Oil, Italy....all of these crises fizzle the same week they are declared 

The real crisis: trying to unwind 9 years of cheap money #QE #ZIRP #QT 

No one talks about that of course!
2295 2018-05-30 20:02:10 Seems like we have the money, throwing billions around for oil sands and pipelines.
2296 2018-05-30 20:02:10 Went out to check oil levels in the Mini. AA man helping out another car, and had a bit of trouble with the catch on the boot lid. He came over and gave the hinges a squirt of WD40. Top bloke. #EverydayHeroes
2297 2018-05-30 20:02:03 You mean the same Quebecors who take equalization payments generated from oil and gas revenue?
2298 2018-05-30 20:01:37 @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau Perhaps a $4B investment in renewable energy would have a better ROR: Would help new technologies, create actual jobs from BC to NL & remove dependance on oil. #cdnpoli
2299 2018-05-30 20:01:36 I would walk to you and talk a bit with you then search food after I would feed you and then I would you give a soft kiss on your lips and then I would massage you with Cocos oil after that I would lick everything down from your body then I would lick in heaven after we both cum
2300 2018-05-30 20:01:35 They have gone down because of better car designs.........not new laws.......

2302 2018-05-30 20:01:20 Politics were involved in the US SST ... Somebody said that it was set up to kill commercially the Concorde ... It was banned to overfly New-York and Washington DC 
(Only 12 were built, share out between BA and AF, and due to the 1973 oil crisis, all options were cancelled)

2306 2018-05-30 20:01:11 Liked segment. Would be nice to see study/graph of correlation between gas prices and oil production costs (volume and cost to produce combined). If gas prices do not correlate .... hmmm. Someone probably has done this
2307 2018-05-30 20:01:10 How long would you marinate the steak in oil & garlic?
2308 2018-05-30 20:01:08 Olive oil has a low smoke point witch causes toxic smoke when cooked too hot.
Use avocado oil for high temperature cooking.
2309 2018-05-30 20:01:06 So I put olive oil on my dog to get dry paint off him & now I can’t get the olive oil off
2310 2018-05-30 20:01:05 They only think gasoline and oil , not even the devices their typing on maybe the iPhone 14 will be made of wood and rock wrapped in dandelion leaves for a cover
2311 2018-05-30 20:01:04 If the American people wish a pacifist boiled in oil, the American Government will be democratic if it boils him in oil. It may not be humane, it may not even be just, it may not be in any sense right; but it will most certainly be democratic.
2312 2018-05-30 20:01:02 Go online and get him CBD oil. I promise you it's damn near a wonder drug.
2313 2018-05-30 20:00:58  ay you irking! It may be! You know even standard be having all the little perks! You know it’s gone last FOREVAAAAA all’s ya gotta do is keep that oil changed .

2317 2018-05-30 20:00:34 I need a car wash.. I let my little cousin & step dad borrow my car.. & now I need a oil change again & all kinds of trash in the back seat. Candy wrappers, water bottles & bags of chips.. shit i would never do! lol
2318 2018-05-30 20:00:34 @narendramodi, i have an idea to reduce fuel price to half without affecting the revenue generation and protecting oil companies interest.

2324 2018-05-30 20:00:03 @MBuhari raised alarm and cried that when he came in the price of crude oil was $30 per barrel, its been climbing steadily since then, where are the monies behind these surpluses? #RedefineNigeria
2325 2018-05-30 20:00:01 It’s a necessity right now if we don’t want to depend on foreign oil. Now in time the plan is for renewables but we just aren’t there yet.

2327 2018-05-30 19:59:55 The oil change is, yes. Not the inspection.
2328 2018-05-30 19:59:54 I did a banana mask, with olive oil & honey. And then I twisted it with the As I Am cream. I liked it. It made it look cute but Inwant a product that will define my curls. I have low porosity hair so it’s hard to find a product that will get into my cuticles
2329 2018-05-30 19:59:52 Can't wait!!!
2330 2018-05-30 19:59:46 Maybe not your medication. Racism is definitely a side effect of snake oil.
2331 2018-05-30 19:59:37 However what is guaranteed to rise is #inflation & #interestrates  caused both by #Trump's proposed new #tariffs and by the $oil price rise partly caused by Trump's foolish foreign policy
2332 2018-05-30 19:59:30 Not more, just different.
2333 2018-05-30 19:59:10 Racists repented, libs loved righties, trump spoke the truth and inspired the nation, shorts fell and Longs skyrocketed, we all agreed where the price of oil was going, cute dog pics were never cuter... but since you came back it reverted back to the same old mess.
2334 2018-05-30 19:58:58 Using vetiver oil on the bottom of your feet and lavender oil in your bath and diffuser, will help you sleep like a baby! *AND* there are no side effects such as grogginess or latenight racist tweeting.

2335 2018-05-30 19:58:43 Hertz - really - rented a car last week and after 4 days the service light goes on - take the car in to exchange yesterday and today at 8am I get an email that the new rental is due for an oil change - please bring the car in and exchange.......... #lastdance
2336 2018-05-30 19:58:38 Red light cameras were effective for a while until they were deemed unConstitutional.
But car fatalities have gone down over the last 50 years due to new laws AND new enforcement policies.
It takes both.
2337 2018-05-30 19:58:23 Me and nano really brought snacks, drinks, our charger and head phones to get our oil changed 
2338 2018-05-30 19:58:15 Ayman asfari oil baron opponent of assad and funder of Chatham House. Very independent. And his wife is a film producer.
2339 2018-05-30 19:58:14 Terrific panel on conservation and red listing at @hayfestival, featuring @distortedabso roasting the palm oil industry. Very informative and grains of hope for the future.
2340 2018-05-30 19:58:10 We have a policy against buying palm oil associated w/ deforestation & have a grievance process in place to investigate these claims and take appropriate action. Our grievance progress has already resulted in the removal of one supplier from our supply chain.
2341 2018-05-30 19:57:53 Dear Miss Rosanna. I am an African-American woman and I love me some you I don't believe you are racist. I believe you knew better. You know deep down the word ape and African-American don't mix it's like oil and water. I have to say this I am very shocked and disappointed.
2342 2018-05-30 19:57:51 Those people also don’t understand that oil is a globally priced commodity and while US production growth is great it’s more than offset by OPEC
2343 2018-05-30 19:57:45 Trump will now put tariffs on our oil because it is subsidized.

2345 2018-05-30 19:57:41 @JasonTorchinsky I am looking for pics of a car - it's a porsche concept from the gas shortage era that they did demonstrating ultra-reliability.  The thing had an external frame, and a huge oil-pan (35k oil change interval or something like that.)  Kno what i'm talking about?
2346 2018-05-30 19:57:30 How dare u to mention her? Don't u have any work? If u don't like her they y r u  still stalking her  & mentioning her in your tweets? U r no one to judge Ben. Just get lost from her mention box. Oil your own machine and have some manner stop spreading negetivity here!
2347 2018-05-30 19:57:28 Just leave California behind you and we'll get along just fine. ;)
2348 2018-05-30 19:57:27 I guess we will have to agree to disagree. The minute he turned up I didn’t trust him and felt he was a snake oil salesman, and I’m even more convinced now. We jumped from the frying pan into the fire.

2350 2018-05-30 19:57:08 Truly lmao it’s so hard. I gotta hop back on that oil
2351 2018-05-30 19:57:02 Good article. Seems Canadians will be paying a CO2 tax for using their own oil & gas, yet offshoring oil through this pipeline to jurisdictions which may not be subject to carbon pricing, putting us once again at a competitive disadvantage. #cdnpoli
2352 2018-05-30 19:56:48 CBD oil
2353 2018-05-30 19:56:44 Might i recommend filling the coolant at the very least. Next to no oil, it's the worst thing for an engine. Also Google /siri can find you public transportation routes, plan ahead
2354 2018-05-30 19:56:37 Have you ever had “Trade Like Chuck” on your show? He seems like a real live snake oil salesmen.
2355 2018-05-30 19:56:31 Who wants to listen to this lying, race baiting Al Sharpton. His history is not only disturbing, it is also hateful with many instances of set ups to encourage racism.

2357 2018-05-30 19:56:23 Deep problem w/ how First Nation support is presented in media is how siding w/ oil is presented as way out of poverty.
Can we talk about WHY some Indigenous Peoples are in situations of structural poverty via CDN policy?
Thus, leaving oil attractive/viable way to tackle poverty

2359 2018-05-30 19:56:20 That Aldi kid looks really good. Basically Cesc and Oil in one player. Looks 1st team ready imo.
2360 2018-05-30 19:56:11 This one is a 2009 or older. I had a 2009 Altima SL up until August. I was shitty with oil changes(went like 30k miles between once), got the tires replaced at 90k miles, the plastic cover on the bottom came off, and I never had even a slight transmission issue.

2363 2018-05-30 19:55:53 @JustinTrudeau what's the @liberal_party plan to set up Canada for the coming third industrial revolution and the end of fossil fuels? Should we cash cow the last days of oil or set ourselves up to be renewable energy resource leader? Or does any of that matter above reelection?
2364 2018-05-30 19:55:52 Congratulations!!! You'll love being able to breathe free air!
2365 2018-05-30 19:55:45 If we can't afford to pay a living wage we should get rid of the program, not make excuses. We shouldn't be surprised that a mandatory program has so many enrollees and we can't wait for oil prices before we do right by citizens
2366 2018-05-30 19:55:38 I've been seeing a TON of tweets wondering why gas prices are rising when US production is at ATH.

Yet no one understands that over the last year Venezuela's loss as well as Saudi's cuts each cost over 1 mil bpd of production.

I'm no oil expert but I can read a chart

2370 2018-05-30 19:55:19 The comb over loon in the White House is playing circus again. Now making it legal for unregulated & unproven treatments to be unleashed on the severely & terminally ill citizens of the US. Snake oil rides again in the wild, Wild West. Did they not know anything about him ?

CBD oil is something you can buy on line and is legal.  It is derived from pot, without the THC.  I have cancer patients who swear by it.

2402 2018-05-30 19:51:43 Uncle even if I agree it is true. Why don't u search for international crude oil prices of that day. They were at least 39% more. People like u shud not blindly support BJP

2405 2018-05-30 19:51:33 Maybe @Tesco should go and see the devastating deforestation in Borneo and realise how bad palm oil is. I was in Borneo 11yrs ago and so much of the forest was decimated then and so many orangutans displaced and refused by sepilok sanctuary

2410 2018-05-30 19:51:22 If we now have $80 per barrel of crude oil in the global market, that's $32 surplus of what @MBuhari earmarked in the 2018 budget - how much is in our ECA? We can actually run the calculation my dear President. #RedefineNigeria

2413 2018-05-30 19:50:53 Then don't follow @FatKidDeals because you'll end up buying a cat tree and won't have a cat. I bought 2 oil diffusers, a juicer and some other stuff I don't remember.
2414 2018-05-30 19:50:52 What can cause oil psi to get high ? Cause my shit too high
2415 2018-05-30 19:50:37 In OPEC matters, when you see them racing ahead on the secretariat’s building and you think that last portion of sachertorte was a bad idea. On #oil generally, when you tell someone about the Gulf War and they think 2003 and you actually mean 1990-91  cc @alexlongley1 @lc_hurst

2419 2018-05-30 19:50:11 A family in Indiana had their child taken from them because they were giving him cannabis oil for his SEVERE epilepsy. Cannabis oil saved this young childs life day after day. 
Legalizing medicinal use of marijuana is the TRUE #RightToTry 
The answer has been with us forever.
2420 2018-05-30 19:50:00 i have been retracing my steps around walmart for the past 10 minutes trying to figure out where i lost my keys and then i realized the guy doing my oil change has them
2421 2018-05-30 19:49:56 Can do custom oil lamps depicting deities (have one in the shape of Dionysos-Osiris in fact lol) flora fauna etc. Can include small inscriptions. Lamps $40 plus shipping
2422 2018-05-30 19:49:42 You’ll be fine baby. Trust me. *That was my final words, before closing the spare tire hatched. Above that I placed the blankets and the spare tires. Next to that the oil canister was placed. I managed to make it look pretty decent. Nothing suspicious about that at all*
2423 2018-05-30 19:49:38 These kids think having less money is somehow going to make is better able to invest in cleaner technology solutions. They want a weak economy. They want more people on employment insurance. It's ridiculous. We need oil. It's coming one way or another.
2424 2018-05-30 19:49:31 We need to move towards renewables. Forget oil, it is the past. We are throwing money down a deep disgusting hole when we should be looking towards the sun
2425 2018-05-30 19:49:29 Peppermint oil spiders hate the smell u should give it a try
2426 2018-05-30 19:49:27 Partially true, but focus on 1 thing like leftists do. Deterioration is evident.

Until recently I had no idea. Disgusting
2427 2018-05-30 19:49:24 Just wondering if ketchups would work as a leave in conditioner. It's basically oil and sugar which is what's in most conditioners.
2428 2018-05-30 19:49:23 EXACTLY!!!! the man was just walking to work ... he might not be able to afford insurance so he damn sure wasn’t gonna be able to afford a $100 oil change or $600 for new tires on a luxury car .... ppl don’t be thinking
2429 2018-05-30 19:49:21 Mwana Uganda yetagaata omuntu ajjigula okuva kubano ba mukuba mundu ne ba Emu-pee abalinga emimonde. You can't tell me that 400++ are sitting to discuss national issues only to end up passing Social Media tax, cooking oil tax and borrow USD millions.
2430 2018-05-30 19:49:15 Please. relax. #PMJT He is buying it with taxpayers money to study it and shut it down. You will get your wish and oil will be transported by rail and imported from the Middle East.  #cdnpoli #TransMountainPipeline
2431 2018-05-30 19:49:03 Well the cycle is actually 8-12 years. Oil, dot com, housing etc...

2435 2018-05-30 19:48:55 Likewise. My impression is that the oil lobby assumes that the public just believes oil is the path to riches (because Beverly Hillbillys ect). No need for facts / evidence if belief deeply seated. Our job is to change public belief.

2437 2018-05-30 19:48:45 Look at the dilapidated school buildings in an oil producing state of Delta whereas the state of Osun with lower allocation has more befitting school structures. Delta state why are you like the entire Nigeria
2438 2018-05-30 19:48:43 Bio oil
2439 2018-05-30 19:48:33 Yeah I haven't tried any of that, what is CBD oil?
2440 2018-05-30 19:48:29 Not even coconut water ? Like I don’t like coconut ice cream , coconut itself, or the coconut oil etc. but I love to drink the coconut water lol
2441 2018-05-30 19:48:28 You proud of the attempt to bring Fracking to Fermanagh? Supporting illegal drilling for oil in Antrim?  How about your current support for @DalradianNI who plan to use two tonne of cyanide per day in @SaveOurSperrins - Pride cometh before a fall, you'd do well to remember that!
2442 2018-05-30 19:48:25 Snake oil salesman.  $54,000,000.00 for a FOURTH business jet.... Really?   Show me the flight log for every hour on each of the other three jets you have already fleeced your sheep to buy
2443 2018-05-30 19:48:16 Too bad they are struggling in the wild due to pollutants from agricultural and automobile oil runoff spilling into the ocean.
2444 2018-05-30 19:48:09 We have a policy against buying palm oil associated w/deforestation & have a grievance process in place to investigate these claims & take appropriate action. Our grievance progress has already resulted in the removal of one supplier from our supply chain.
2445 2018-05-30 19:48:07 Is Mr.Nyantakyi the energy minister he is the GFA president he deals in football so if one decides to engage him(Set-up) in oil business is that football matter.
2446 2018-05-30 19:47:50 I don't buy products even if they state 'sustainable palm oil'.....but bread in particular is hard to find without palm oil in it. 1 crop a year of rapeseed = expensive to supermarkets & 3 or 4 crops a year from palm oil = cheap. People want cheap food & the wildlife pays for it
2447 2018-05-30 19:47:38 The Gulf BP oil spill lasted unabated for 5 months in 2010, despite Obama's & oil industry attempts to stop it (and it was still leaking in 2012).  Can you imagine Trump trying to deal with that?  It'd probably leak for 5 YEARS with his degree of incompetence in problem-solving.
2448 2018-05-30 19:47:33 Lies about CBD oil you fraud
2449 2018-05-30 19:47:19 We are in this situation today because our former PM Harper lacked the leadership skills and political savvy to get a pipeline built to the west coast. It will be a liberal PM, a Trudeau no less, who frees Alberta oil 
2450 2018-05-30 19:47:17 I want to look in to using a CBD oil for my muscle pain but I'm too chicken to go into a herbal store by myself
2451 2018-05-30 19:47:09 Revitalize the Snake Oil Industry!!!
2452 2018-05-30 19:47:03 The pipeline IS the balance we need. It's the safest way we can transport oil. It benefits our economy. With our stronger economy we can invest in other energy technology like wind and solar. A weak economy is never the answer to alternative energy.

2455 2018-05-30 19:46:36 @AmazonHelp. I had to fetch my oil pan 2km from home, even though we were home all day. For my other package, 2/3 delivery "attempts" were made while we were at home. The driver never rang. Your service is unfortunately useless in #Berlin.

2460 2018-05-30 19:45:58 Like President Trump, @therealroseanne has the ability to bring the slim of the left to the top, like oil in water. Ambien related or not, a comedians take on crossing vj with a terrorist to look like a Faceoff character was not intended to insult. Vj in fur!
2461 2018-05-30 19:45:47 Not to add oil to the fire but the two times I saw Drake live he let ALL the crowed say "nigga" 
2462 2018-05-30 19:45:43 Mental Asymetry: When a pipeline/ oil sands protestor asserts paramountcy of current climate science hypothesis yet denies applied materials sciences & physics as applied to engineering non-leaking pipelines, vessels & spill detection/ remediation / navigation methods.

2466 2018-05-30 19:45:28 The pipeline is the cleanest option we have for transporting the oil. A weak economy forces countries to be more dependent on oil long term. Wealthy countries are able to invest in wind and solar tech more. So why exactly would Trudeau fight the pipeline?
2467 2018-05-30 19:45:28 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
2468 2018-05-30 19:45:26 More to the point is that petroleum products that don't get burned are not fossil fuels. We can keep using some oil / gas based plastics etc without cooking the planet. We can't keep burning more and more fossil fuels.
2469 2018-05-30 19:45:24 so which episode does villianelle paint a gigantic oil portrait of eve in
2470 2018-05-30 19:45:24 Should I grab lunch....grab lunch & go workout or grab lunch,go workout & oil my scalp??? I’m just trying see do I have time before we finish this nigga!!! @Drake
2471 2018-05-30 19:45:22 Data is the new oil. Speed is the new water. Change has never happened this fast before, and it will never be this slow again.
2472 2018-05-30 19:45:09 The world is laughing at @JustinTrudeau and the @liberal_party. Claims to be a climate leader then nationalizes a controversial oil pipeline. The hypocrisy is almost as thick as the bitumen. You’ve really messed it up. Good luck on getting votes from BC next election.
2473 2018-05-30 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2474 2018-05-30 19:45:02 Definitely check the oil. Possibly new brake pads.

2476 2018-05-30 19:44:55 They did find someone who could perfectly reproduce how Europe looks at night. They even remembered to include the North Sea oil fields.
2477 2018-05-30 19:44:54 Baby steps, but if this is built on, it can be great to counter not just bakeries but also fraudulent gas stations and by extension, oil smuggling. European countries aren't exactly incentivized to tackle the latter, but Libyans care about it a lot. #Libya

2479 2018-05-30 19:44:48 Oil burns feel hurt like all hell is breaking loose
2480 2018-05-30 19:44:45 As at today, the price of crude oil per barrel goes for $75.45, this is nearly $80. Nigerians are yet to benefit from such increase. @MBuhari and his gangs of looters are even planning on increasing pump price. #RedefineNigeria
2481 2018-05-30 19:44:25 I don’t understand why CBD oil isn’t legal in Arkansas. I spoke to a pharmacist today, he said I don’t care about research I will not order you any. But you can take Valium or Flexeril to relax your body.
2482 2018-05-30 19:44:17 We spent the money on the expansion, which is about double the old line. And how is the old one on its last legs? You've seen the in-line inspections? Current oil pricing  accounts for supply you mentioned, so why is price climbing? Right, demand is climbing. Read more.
2483 2018-05-30 19:44:17 I don't think the insinkerator would have coped. A couple of good size pieces though, integral to the overall flavour of the curry.
Also I set fire to some oil which I forgot was on the stove, and dropped my spices on the floor.
No Prosecco involved.
2484 2018-05-30 19:44:13 #resist I SWEAR MY PHONE IS LISTENING! Many times I have said something out loud like New Hellmann’s Mayo with avocado oil , all in a sudden its advertised in all my social media ! This has happened many times w different products! Not something searched for ! Verbalized /appears
2485 2018-05-30 19:44:00 For $335 you can buy 1000 $LINK. That’s like buying an oil field back in the 1800s. Deals on deals on deals
2486 2018-05-30 19:43:55 They all divested because of high capital required and they did it while oil was lower than today's prices. they also bought most of these assets when oil was trading way above today's prices. They did same thing before & company's like CNQ takes advantage of the stupidity
2487 2018-05-30 19:43:54 Is this oil paint?
2488 2018-05-30 19:43:50 Calling all snake oil salesmen.
2489 2018-05-30 19:43:36 Nah cause if I couldn’t afford it in the first place what I’m going do about the oil change & the maintenance itself. 
2490 2018-05-30 19:43:24 That 'coverage' needs a bit more balance... repeating govt and oil industry speaking points - and ignoring key issues like pending indigenous court cases, and the massive hypocrisy of the PM - is gross.

2496 2018-05-30 19:42:20 You ever heard about how the government killed Stanley Meyer, the inventor of the water fuel cell that would have replaced oil? Along with many others, the people in power kill off all threats to petroleum sales!
2497 2018-05-30 19:42:15 Pipelines ARE bringing change for a cleaner country. They get tanker trucks off the road. Risk of spills is lowered. You are thinking short term and not long term. A stronger economy allows us to invest in other clean tech. A weak economy makes us more dependent on oil.
2498 2018-05-30 19:42:10 i feel your pain mate i really do im not a expert just another sufferer but things that have defiantly helped me a bunch is exercise at least 30-1hour a day CBD Oil and Cold Showers and baths if you Havant tried any of the above maybe look into it ?

Given U.S. willful instability of solid agreements with her, Russia's generations long history of gas and oil reliability, lower prices and easy availability, staying with Russia makes sense."

2510 2018-05-30 19:40:58 Don’t agree with Mr Trudeau on much but thus I do.   We are a big country and comprises are needed.   Mr Horgan wants a pipeline but only to supply oil for refineries in his  province.  That’s not how a true country operates.  So thank God the PM took some action.

There wouldn't be an oil industry in alberta without gov't support. Perhaps you don't remember the early days of the tar sands development?

2527 2018-05-30 19:39:14 Russia better hope that oil prices don’t bottom out.  

Hard to feel for a country that still revers Stalin.
2528 2018-05-30 19:39:10 If that's true, why didn't Obama get us out? 

Pretty asinine and myopic to look back a dozen plus years and blame "the Bushes" for a war to which "the Obamas" added 68,000 troops. "Oil Barrons." That's rich.

Under a MoU between Iran and #Azerbaijan, the two countries are expected to jointly develop #Alborz and #Sardar-e Jangal #oil fields in #Caspian_Sea
2537 2018-05-30 19:38:25 Wow,  you mean bad guys don't follow laws 
2538 2018-05-30 19:38:22 how bout high quality cannabis oil?
2539 2018-05-30 19:38:21 Fact is Right.....gov kept on raising price even when crude oil price was low....they r not cutting on tax...intentionality..
2540 2018-05-30 19:38:20 Great!!! Coconut oil is good for hair in general. I've been using Argan oil
2541 2018-05-30 19:38:14 Thanks, Jonathan. That's a good one I read myself some years ago. Was amazed about Exxon's role as quasi-US-govt in African countries. With State Dpt supporting them. Relevant to get oil & geopolitics.
2542 2018-05-30 19:38:13 Immigration factors in. 30% + of Fed System are illegals. Similar in some states. Free up space for American criminals, we r stuck with
2543 2018-05-30 19:37:45 India & Iran drop dollar in oil trade to bypass US sanctions.

India will reportedly pay for Iranian oil in rupees as the two countries seek to bypass the US economic pressure on Tehran,
2544 2018-05-30 19:37:40 When they first proposed TMX oil was $120 and tight oil/shale oil wasn't a disruptive technology.  Also Russia didn't have as much capacity to China as it does now.

2545 2018-05-30 19:37:39 He better stay the fuck over where he at I’m tryna catch this sun  I got baby oil on and all 
2546 2018-05-30 19:37:35 Even in NZ I'm being asked to explain why the  'progressive PM Trudeau' is selling out to the oil barons.  Where is the promised leadership on climate change? He has proven to be no different than the Conservatives.
2547 2018-05-30 19:37:34 Yeah, otherwise he'd be cooked with all the oil he must use #BritainsGotTalent
2548 2018-05-30 19:37:27 Yes! It’s like 1970s mixed with oil from trains
2549 2018-05-30 19:37:25 I am a robot. I piss oil
2550 2018-05-30 19:37:21 John, want a great investment AND unplug crazy people who control oil?  My engine can get 80-95% of the fuel gone.  Electrics won't work.  Solve transportation?  Need my roadable seaplane.  Want to discuss?  seaplaneguy@msn.com
2551 2018-05-30 19:37:20 I am living it here in California.  Burden the law abiding while the criminals continue their behavior!  Which gun law in California has worked?  I could go on and on about our ass backward laws here in California!!!!!
2552 2018-05-30 19:37:09 That's actually hilarious there's this burger joint in Toronto that does this like $50 hamburger with truffle oil on it lmao
2553 2018-05-30 19:37:07 Great idea to add renewables! Indeed Alaska is giant laboratory, & Warming Climate is melting your perms frost, why not leave oil in ANWR ground????

2556 2018-05-30 19:36:56 For the first 3 Days I been putting coconut oil on my scalp and on the braids and wrapping it
2557 2018-05-30 19:36:55 My uncle called me today about an oil job in Midland/Lubbock area and l had to turn it down because l just bought a house, l have a puppy, and making pretty damn good money at home. I’m officially living my best life! 
2558 2018-05-30 19:36:39 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2561 2018-05-30 19:36:31 You don’t go buying gifts like that without taking care of the up keep. An oil change alone on my Land Rover is got damn $128. Both take premium fuel and that’s never cheap
2562 2018-05-30 19:36:28 I have to get my oil changed but i don’t even feel like getting up
2563 2018-05-30 19:36:16 That’s how I feel about my aesthetician, she saved my skin. But haven’t found any products that I can’t live without. I’ll try the oil though thnxx
2564 2018-05-30 19:36:08 Oil never came from fossil fuels. That's a lie. Oil is the life blood of earth! I would rather noose myself than believe anything I was taught in school.
2565 2018-05-30 19:36:08 A solid knowledge of history is clearly today's hot job skill. Historians are needed to track/measure the relative grandeur/minimal impact of everything this president does, from day to day. These guys must all burn the midnight oil (before Twitter time) every night! #wowfactor
2566 2018-05-30 19:36:04 @esaagar In essence, Sarah blew off any question or angle you would have like to followed-up. One side is about to put their foot down. Trump about to make a charge?
2567 2018-05-30 19:35:56 I’ve just upgraded to even more expensive snake oil!
2568 2018-05-30 19:35:56 Big oil is booming, that’s all. Environment loses every time.
2569 2018-05-30 19:35:50 Vegans: 

Also vegans: infighting endlessly about the @ImpossibleFoods burger, @Oreo, gluten, sugar, salt, oil, whether or not you make your own plant milk and eat anything that casts a shadow.
2570 2018-05-30 19:35:39 Wow, only olive oil for dressing? Seems so plain !
2571 2018-05-30 19:35:28 Michelle, you missed my favourite, canola oil!
2572 2018-05-30 19:35:25 Then there is Alberta. Conservatives govern through multiple oil booms and leave nothing in the bank? How dare they lecture anyone on fiscal responsibility. They could have been Norway, but chose to be broke. /4
2573 2018-05-30 19:35:20 You can also grow your own and make the FECO, check out Rick Simpson oil, he gives instructions.

2575 2018-05-30 19:35:07 I better go get some coconut oil
2576 2018-05-30 19:35:02 The use by date on our oils do not help either but we have little choice but to provide what is required. The IOOC standards stipulate 24 months for evoo from production however the oil doesnt expire at the end of the 24 months. Only the evoo classification does.
2577 2018-05-30 19:34:53 I would get cannabis oil for my child.  Most of us would, I'm sure.
2578 2018-05-30 19:34:48 Was there similair levels of turmoil in the ME before Sykes Picot and the discovery of oil? I always assumed those factors (plus everything that followed) exacerbated existing sectarianism and turmoil to levels we see today.
2579 2018-05-30 19:34:43 Came to get my oil changed at the dealership and the dude said it was going to take 2 hrs bc they need to other the filter and I said I have a new one I haven’t used in my car he said look at you who drives around with filters in their car... lmao ME 
2580 2018-05-30 19:34:36 IMO Trudeau seems even more a tool (take it any way you want!) of corporate interests (especially oil) than Harper ever was. That's pretty bad. May he enjoy the same fate.

So come over to Mother Earth Oils Store on FB for essential oil products.
2589 2018-05-30 19:33:56 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

2593 2018-05-30 19:33:31 I'm not sure where you live, but if you go to a dispensary, they have those pills that are made just from the canabis oil, and they work, and they don't cost 700.00.
2594 2018-05-30 19:33:24 That's just not true.  She got hired for being a Trump supporter to appeal to that demographic and it worked.  Unfortunately that demo is generally sub human and see nothing wrong with racism.
2595 2018-05-30 19:33:20 Actually, they don't. I live in California and nightly in Fresno there are several shootings involving gangs. What is working is solving the gang issue.  Our property crimes, however, are on the rise thanks to prop 47.  Again, the law abiding rights are infringed upon!
2596 2018-05-30 19:33:20 Snake oil...!

2603 2018-05-30 19:32:52 Protect California’s precious coast from the Trump offshore oil drilling plan. Please support AB 1775 and SB 834 to prevent oil spills and protect clean air, water, and a vibrant coastal economy.
2604 2018-05-30 19:32:46 Today is Biafra Remembrance Day.

I have no idea of the laws of your state. Given my status as an MD, I want to make clear that in no way does this represent any form of medical advice. These are questions only. Have you Googled CBD oil? Have you considered inhaled cannabis?

CBD has also improved cognition in those without a disorder.

2626 2018-05-30 19:30:39 You don't need God to answer that one. Pringles are indeed potato chips or crisps if you prefer, at least they were originally marketed as potato chips in the olden days. They are just baked as opposed deep fried in oil. Let the debate begin! 
2627 2018-05-30 19:30:38 Yep, with rolling I meant that my tyres were rolling and throwing oil/tar :) With a little scrub I was able to remove black dots from my skin.

2636 2018-05-30 19:29:43 Yup - perfect #liberal #Trudeau logic - to make people stop using oil and make them pay a huge tax on that oil we just bought an oil pipeline to increase production and use of oil - yup solid #LPC logic there
2637 2018-05-30 19:29:36 I truly don't understand what @Bill_Morneau and @JustinTrudeau are doing. Even the private sector won't make long-term investments in oil any longer because they know that by the time the project is done, solar energy will be cheaper than oil. Economic growth is in renewables.
2638 2018-05-30 19:29:36 Looking for a Markus or Marcus from the Bay Area who works in the oil refinery ... rt for me anyone know him
2639 2018-05-30 19:29:30 Oil must surely be kept in the ground? That IS what the science says. I am unclear why Canada is planning on extracting unburnable oil. Could turn it into LEGO bricks I guess? #ClimateAction #Science
2640 2018-05-30 19:29:14 He represents oil corporations, not the people of Canada
2641 2018-05-30 19:29:12 Yes they do, but they have extortionate taxes. Do you know how much tax you pay to buy a small Japanese car? Plus Singapore is a city that is built on its location. Gateway to the Far East, shopping and oil hub, container hub. And practically a quasi dictatorship. But successful
2642 2018-05-30 19:29:09 Cottage cheese, olive oil & tomatoes.. I just can’t with my coworkers
2643 2018-05-30 19:29:06 Quick question. Is the carbon tax applied to exported oil or bitumen?
2644 2018-05-30 19:29:05 Some laws actually do work.
California has one of the lowest per capita gun violence rates in the country.
Their laws work rather well.

2654 2018-05-30 19:28:00 I've seen a diesel run away. (for the benefit of Ioan): turbo seal fails, pumps oil into intercooler and then engine- engine runs on this and speeds up, pumping more oil into the turbo which leaks and into the engine as fuel and...

2664 2018-05-30 19:26:33 Is it fair to assume then that your preference is to move more oil by rail through the Rockies? I find that prospect much more frightening.
2665 2018-05-30 19:26:02 No Longer Addicted to Oil Money Russia Wants End to Production Cuts, Lower Price

Russia does not need the oil money as much as it used to. It would prefer a stable price to another boom and boost
2666 2018-05-30 19:26:00 and of course like the oil meme
2667 2018-05-30 19:25:55 My gf's mum used to have to take around 10 painkillers a day for arthritis, but with the CBD oil she's down to two, or 4 at the most. Least she's had to take in near a decade

2670 2018-05-30 19:25:17 You should open a business, hire ONLY women to do everything--sales, construction, drive trucks, work oil rigs. You could give them all a 10% raise and still be KILLING the competition that is saddled with all those overpaid men.
2671 2018-05-30 19:25:06 And then let's build energy east so we don't need to import any foreign oil and send billions overseas rather than spending that in Canada supporting Canadian jobs and the tax revenues / benefits that come with it

2673 2018-05-30 19:24:42 We are exporting more oil like never before.  Russia and Saudi have noticed. They are going to raise their production output. I project the prices will fall sooner than later

2689 2018-05-30 19:23:29 She left out the lies about Alaska and all its oil. The oil there was guesstimated for Regan’s tax cuts there is no proof there is that much oil in Alaska.  Drilling there will do nothing and like the off shore drilling will take 20+ years to earn any money. So there’s that too.
2690 2018-05-30 19:23:22 People will say a lot of things to find rational for why things haven't worked well with current laws, as for a need for even more laws. It's illogical.

2694 2018-05-30 19:22:46 The oil sands is already getting 20% of Canada's 2030 carbon budget - and that target needs to be made more ambitious. Also, we aren't going to meet the current 2030 target given current plans.

2713 2018-05-30 19:20:48 @HolmanJenkins Clapper. Fracking reduced crude oil price $50+, with natural gas effect a 10% hit to Russian GDP. Why would Putin assist the party for fracking vs the party that vowed to greatly restrict it. Also, why assist the party for a strong military.

Get basil when its in the season, crush up the leaves and put it in a jar full of olive oil. Close the jar and keep at an ambient temperature. You'll be able to keep them for about 6 months.

2732 2018-05-30 19:18:50 Actually it was. They are building up their military. They want control of that trade area of the world. Oil is dead man. The combustible engine will go the way of the steam engine. Newer technologies will prevail and California knows it.
2733 2018-05-30 19:18:46 Got my oil changed and got the car wash with it...and hopefully they didn’t care that I had a million water bottles in my backseat  I’m an athlete alright leave me alone

2737 2018-05-30 19:18:11 Fun fact: Original Chinese water snake oil was actually an effective remedy for inflammation for that time, due to very high omega fatty acid content. The fake part starts then hucksters in US started made fake products with US snake species and sometimes just mineral oil.

2743 2018-05-30 19:17:23 In this regard, is it fair to say that our federal government now has an incentive to increase & maximize the value of this asset, such as by promoting oil sands exploitation, diminishing the regulatory burden faced by the industry, etc?

2807 2018-05-30 19:12:09 release a tanning oil so i can look as crisp as you @EthanDolan @GraysonDolan
2808 2018-05-30 19:11:58 I think there is an even more fundamental problem. As a diabetic I have been through a series of these questionaires and time and again they add things together that makes no sense eg meat products - natural dried meats  or2 carb covered seed oil cooked reconstituted meat waste."
2809 2018-05-30 19:11:57 Still waiting for a convoy of oil haulers to head to port via the Coquihalla Highway. 
Pipelines are still the most efficient way to transport.
2810 2018-05-30 19:11:57 Anything moisturizing or oil based has the chance of clogging your pores. That’s why they tell you to wash and exfoliate before using it. I know loads of people that got rid of severe acne by using coconut oil. Not that it will work for everyone, because we are all different.
2811 2018-05-30 19:11:56 butter or heavy cream or coconut oil or coconut cream in tea.
2812 2018-05-30 19:11:56 You are exceptionally delusional. Seriously follow the money. Look at what China is doing, the next world super power. They are going green. Oil is a finite resource and economically volatile.
2813 2018-05-30 19:11:49 I wear Double Wear, and for me nothing short of double-cleansing with an oil and then a foaming cleanser completely removes it!
2814 2018-05-30 19:11:30 Is the best way to bake without oil is using baking paper ? I need optioooons
2815 2018-05-30 19:11:29 be safe j bird, dont want to be stuck adding to shorts all the way up into the 70s like Joe friday and the fin twit OG's, they too didn't think oil had legs after the last washout in feb
2816 2018-05-30 19:11:27 Haha use oil
2817 2018-05-30 19:11:18 That’s because you don’t understand the desire to allow government to control everything you do. That’s a progressive thought process.
2818 2018-05-30 19:11:16 What you don't realize is that Trump has in his plans to sell that land to oil companies. That section is very rich in oil. So, you don't like protecting those beautiful lands but you like them to be destroyed forever by drilling. How pathetic you sound.

2820 2018-05-30 19:11:13 Vajpayee govt privatised PSUs,But in Modi govt none of strategic disinvestment proposals from their own NITI aayog was executed & instead poor/middle class were over taxed on OIL.MODI GOVT is an economic disaster @dravirmani @dhume @jimmygeorgec @Ashutosh_T

2823 2018-05-30 19:11:02 Change in plans. Just too drained of energy today. Just did oil. Hamge and working on sudoku atm.
2824 2018-05-30 19:10:55 How do you explain the SACROC and Yates oil fields? Both billion barrel fields operated by Kinder Morgan. Both in Texas.
2825 2018-05-30 19:10:45 Hmmm  I only wash it twice a day with free oil soap, use sunscreen, drink lots of water and eat veggies and fruits, nothing special :'(
2826 2018-05-30 19:10:42 She Was Like ..  I Know Good & Dogon Well You Didn’t  Curse Just Now  . I Said Nooo  Ma’ What You Heard Was “ Ohhh Shhh” . Then My Daddy Jump In Talking About ‘  GET THE OIL .. 
2827 2018-05-30 19:10:39 moisturizing with oil > moisturizing with lotion
2828 2018-05-30 19:10:26 The purpose of Libyan overturn of Gaddafi & in Syria removal of Asad govt.are same. Leave these countries in choas & infightings, while arms supplied to all warring groups & then enjoy the oil booty. This formula was used earlier in S.America & Africa had proved succesful also
2829 2018-05-30 19:10:24 It really makes you avoid prepackaged food doesn't it! Only on 2 syns today and that's because I bought tuna in sunflower oil instead of brine/spring water!

2831 2018-05-30 19:10:13 Kinda of like banning guns to stop violence?   Guns and cars don't break the laws, people do.  I do not understand the desire to infringe on my rights while fighting human nature.
2832 2018-05-30 19:10:13 How you cooks/chefs cope with frying stuff every day? I need to get a face mask cos hot oil and that pop sound scares the fuck outta me.

2834 2018-05-30 19:10:02 WTI has a quality problem. Specification of WTI is API 35 to 41. Yet most of WTI today is tilted towards 41. When mixed with heavy oil API can go down, yet gasoline yield is low.
2835 2018-05-30 19:09:58 Mr President... $50 to fill my car... wanna guess where my tax savings is going ? Yup big oil!  Wasn’t the last administration crucified for $3 gas? Open the spigot here in the US and gas will go down... well it’s $3.08 just in time for summer
2836 2018-05-30 19:09:58 Kenya will export crude oil n keep importing for domestic use? Why don't we process our own crude oil for local consumptions first!

2842 2018-05-30 19:09:19 i’ve seen the most improvement in people’s hair if they do a hair and nails vitamin, omega 3 capsules are good too. for deep conditioning it could be a store bought one, coconut oil, avocado, olive oil, egg yolk (cold shower trust me), aloe vera, etc.
2843 2018-05-30 19:09:08 Too bad Kinder Morgan did not call force majeure on that less than 1 barrel of oil spill. Perhaps if that happened the Government of B.C would change its mind. #buildthepipeline

2847 2018-05-30 19:08:41 I've wanted to try Snake Oil for a while, so yeah that sounds great.
2848 2018-05-30 19:08:36 Nothing on the oil crash being the cause and absense of reserves due to depletion to withstand that shock? 
Okay I'm listening to you.

2850 2018-05-30 19:08:19 Actually, both have similar effects, and both have people that break the law by running them. What new law would prevent people from running red lights? ban cars?
2851 2018-05-30 19:08:08 @Bel_Ray Good Day. I have own a 2015 Huskqvarna Tc125. What would be the best gearbox/engine oil to use? The manual recommend Exl Mineral 4T, but it is not available here in South Africa. The spec code is SAE 10W40. Would your gear-saver 80W be the answer? Regards @buspig19
2852 2018-05-30 19:08:05 Instead of Canada buying out a 60 year old texas oil pipeline for 4.5 billion (plus another 7.4 for expansion) we could invest that in renewable energy and transition jobs to that. Why are we wasting so much money on a dying industry that's destroying the planet
2853 2018-05-30 19:07:49 After continuous rise in Oil Prices for 20 consecutive Days, at last Central Govt took Great U Turn n granted Relief of One Paise Decrease to alleviate Burden of Common Indian bearing 100%+ Tax on Petrol, Diesel, Gas n Petroleum Products.

2855 2018-05-30 19:07:36 With all due respect, I totally disagree. 12 person cabin with 2100NM range at 300knots for $30m is mega bang for buck compared to private jets/helos. With a 30yr life, this could greatly affect transpo world. Oil rigs, mining etc all could use this speed adv over normal copters.

"Everyone is dumb and they'll believe anything I say." No one's been able to prove him wrong so far.  All the idiots in the United States who voted for him, still believe him. He's no different than a snake oil salesman.

2868 2018-05-30 19:06:18 Because it's a country called Kenya. As long as we have joined the league off oil exporting countries.
2869 2018-05-30 19:06:15 Kenya as a country is already mortgaged to the Chinese; we understand the rush to export the oil to China. Its going to flow freely to Beijing for a very very long time under our watch!
Sad.
2870 2018-05-30 19:06:15 This is the REAL America. Not the if it bleeds it leads and the hate mongering bigoted America the MSM harps on 24/7. It's tiresome
2871 2018-05-30 19:06:06 That slick-haired snake oil salesman has some large kahunas. People that believe him & people like him, well, I almost feel sorry for them.
2872 2018-05-30 19:06:05 @honda2wheelerin why won't you reply to our query. Of there has to be a mandatory service where oil has to be changed otherwise engine will suffer why do u charge for oil. U should provide prebreaked engines or provide truly free service. Like toyata.

2876 2018-05-30 19:04:58 1990, Australian punk rockers Midnight Oil interrupted their tour of North America for an impromptu protest concert from a flatbed truck parked in front of the Exxon Oil Building in New York City.

2880 2018-05-30 19:04:46 coconut oil has a 4/5 comedogenic rating aka it will most likely give you some form of acne or other skin reaction. Pls for the love of god stop putting that shit on ur face and mentioning it in skincare threads
2881 2018-05-30 19:04:37 tea tree oil did more damage to my face than it did good shit is cancelled
2882 2018-05-30 19:04:22 This pasta sauce is basically just olive oil, salt, butter, garlic, cheese, and pasta water. So basically it’s everything bad for you and I’d like to drink a gallon of this stuff, thank you. 
2883 2018-05-30 19:04:18 “We only vacuum with a signature oil change.” Okay well an oil change is half the price of what I just spent so? Let’s have some common sense? I just spent $117 on some fucking lightbulbs, throw me a bone here.
2884 2018-05-30 19:04:16 nothing more annoying than when almond butter has all that oil on top and they expect u to mix it. like i’m paying for almond butter not almond liquid i wish these companies would get it together before selling their products

the obituary for oil."
2889 2018-05-30 19:04:08 oil has turned sand lots into powerful nations.... that other crap is done at your own peril. that dosnt fly in our society. its not like we are china or india.

2891 2018-05-30 19:03:51 I prefer the term "BHO" shop. That's "butane hash oil" for you old farts. I know the world is changing rapidly.
2892 2018-05-30 19:03:50 Politicians in general. A politician forgets he works for the people under our Constitution. A statesman remembers both; and there are far too few statesmen at every level of government.

2895 2018-05-30 19:03:43 I wish someone could take everything from you made by oil and you can use nothing from oil. See how you do then.
2896 2018-05-30 19:03:43 Back hurts worse getting in/out of car, so I skipped the bank and getting air in the deflating front tires and paid over $4/gal. even with the 20-cent per gal. discount! Next: oil & lube;driving down the half a tank. I'll have to actually GO SOMEWHERE. *facepalm*
2897 2018-05-30 19:03:35 this is random but I have this Very Specific Naminé hc that the crayons she uses are this Japanese kind I have had since I was a kid that seem to be called "soft crayons," they seem similar to oil pastels but not quite?? and different than regular crayons. anyway that's my take,
2898 2018-05-30 19:03:18 We went out and got 2 new tires and an oil change.  RIP Bank account, but it feels awesome to be safe on the road again. One of our tires was on it's last leg.  And got it all done on my day off.  Is this adulting at it's finest? 
2899 2018-05-30 19:03:13 So, one does not work let's try a different solution.  Criminals do not follow gun laws, so why do more of the same? Maybe a different solution is in order?

2913 2018-05-30 19:01:40 It is because congress borrowed from market rather then taxing people for govt but bjp does the opposite. Due to regressive policies of congress india pays 5 lac crore interest every year. If they didn't have to pay that, oil prices could have been less.

2934 2018-05-30 19:00:22 Texas is nothing without oil and the world is moving away from fossil fuels and more towards clean/renewable energies. Guess what state leads by a long shot in that category? California.
2935 2018-05-30 19:00:22 Any Oil change place
2936 2018-05-30 19:00:20 Have you?
We, italians, did. It was no paradise, but it certainly wasn't the black hole of depression we live in now, either.
Ah, most of the inflation you show in that graph was caused by the oil shocks in the seventies.

2938 2018-05-30 19:00:07 Eliminating poverty, ensuring access to clean drinking water (besides being on the right side of history and all that) are some of the most effective ways to create wealth.  From the ground up, for real grassroots Canadians.  Not for a handful of oil execs and shareholders.
2939 2018-05-30 19:00:06 The thing is all oil changes are the same it just depends on what oil you need for your car.... we have to use synthetic it cost a little bit more.... it’s 60 65 max for an oil change

2946 2018-05-30 18:59:29 I'm going to assume you're not just being obtuse. The goal is to make the technology cost efficient & reliable.

And oil is a finite resource. Precisely why we're looking to other sources.

America was built on "we CAN", not "we can't". Time for change.
2947 2018-05-30 18:59:26 On Monday I made an appt online for inspection/oil change at local dealer. Got e-mail today confirming. Then a phone call saying I couldn’t have the appt because it was too close to technicians’ lunch. They were adamant.
2948 2018-05-30 18:59:17 If they'd started using oil instead of water like we asked we'd be done by now
2949 2018-05-30 18:59:16 Is a comedian any different than an artist, only dealing in verbal amusement vs canvas and oil? Are artists to be next in line for censorship?
2950 2018-05-30 18:59:15 Genie oil must be scrambling....
2951 2018-05-30 18:59:12 if it feels dry, argon oil is meant to be good!! i know lush has some hair things but they’d most likely be expensive
2952 2018-05-30 18:59:09 Got an oil change, bought windshield wipers, and toothbrush replacement heads. Am I an adult or just not spoiled by my mom anymore ???
2953 2018-05-30 18:58:55 Dealership or oil change place
2954 2018-05-30 18:58:53 Why is it that women feel guilty for living their lives. Right now I’m getting my oil changed, something I’ve been putting off for weeks, that I need to do, and I feel guilty because I could be working.
2955 2018-05-30 18:58:50 Honey, I spent some years redtaping in banking and big oil. Trust me, you're lucky to be paid this year.
2956 2018-05-30 18:58:37 1st get off your computer and or what ever other device. bcuz no matter what device u r using it has parts made w/ oil i.e. plastics....many spout negatively about oil but not before their conveniences are met.
2957 2018-05-30 18:58:32 Coconut oil is overrated.
2958 2018-05-30 18:58:29 A GREEK CHILD JUST GIFTED ME A BOTTLE OF OLIVE OIL ! ! !
2959 2018-05-30 18:58:20 Sir he is giving lectures on d stage of @IndiaToday about how to control crude oil prices in india. He is a shameless creature.
2960 2018-05-30 18:58:18 There’s a dangerous trend to disregard scientists & sciences; this bill further encourages that & the snake oil sellers
2961 2018-05-30 18:58:07 Yes one will argue that we have resources like oil on our salvation list but reliance on none renewable natural resources can’t lead to sustainable development.
2962 2018-05-30 18:58:01 Peppermint oil is also very good for clearing the tubes.  Dragon and Mum approved!
2963 2018-05-30 18:57:54 What about the $2 Billion he gave Petrobas to drill off their coast of Brazil after Obama lectured us on the evil of oil. Soros was a major stock holder. Can you say collusion again
2964 2018-05-30 18:57:54 For most little bites, I like to use Tea Tree Oil because it stops the itch and helps clean out the bite too.
2965 2018-05-30 18:57:50 If you throw cbd oil into an oil diffuser what happens? Also, does cbd oil smell like marijuana? Or does it just smell like oil? I need the 411
2966 2018-05-30 18:57:49 I would generally have smelling a bit of cooking oil than being achy
2967 2018-05-30 18:57:34 I have it! I find regulating foods like tomatoes and oil helps mine
2968 2018-05-30 18:57:28 I think I’d entertain a 4 way poll between Big Wave, Sunchaser, Neck Oil and Wolfpup
2969 2018-05-30 18:57:26 this stock is more psychology than level, so what i mean is that you need a feel of the type of ppl buying up until that point, if they're chasers like the types in oil and spx were this year, you'll jus tknow it'll crater fast. shorts like this are the hardest. total feel sport
2970 2018-05-30 18:56:54 I coulda changed my own oil faster than this
2971 2018-05-30 18:56:54 I just watched my first & last episode of The Carbonaro Effect while having my oil changed. Mein Gott, it’s awful. The worst show I’ve seen in years.
2972 2018-05-30 18:56:48 1. I can't remember when last I ate 3Sq meals a day.
2. They ve extended their killings to churches/ seminary. No fear!
3. With what's happening in the intl oil market, why's petrol is N145 per litre?
4. I can't enjoy my fav food, beans cos it's costly
2973 2018-05-30 18:56:42 Why can't we refine the oil in turkana and have the same used in Kenya and exported to Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi via a pipeline to Kisumu? I don't know why the fellows in government always think funny
2974 2018-05-30 18:56:40 Lol yep! That’s so Ary! My mom left a bottle of baby oil open and before we could stop her it was all in her hair and over her body. I thought we were never going to get it out of her hair! 
2975 2018-05-30 18:56:32 Every snake oil salesman in the world will now have an office in every big pharma firm #evilGOP
2976 2018-05-30 18:56:26 Not to sound like a future Albertan, but actually just to say what I've felt for decades despite my strong environmental stance: if people don't like pipelines and deep-sea drilling and fracking and spills and expeditionary wars to keep oil flowing, then stop using oil.
2977 2018-05-30 18:56:20 My niece knows me so well, as I’m packing she sits here and asks me if I got my “coco oil” . She knows I can’t go anywhere w out my coconut oil 
2978 2018-05-30 18:56:08 ....will you be trying CBD oil?....serious inquiry...
2979 2018-05-30 18:55:59 The opec oil crisis along with piss poor Briitish management failing 2 innovate like the Germans & Japs was at the heart of our probs Thatchers solution was to close our industry throw 3 million on the dole sell our assets & enter the neo-liberal era thats got us 2 where we r now
2980 2018-05-30 18:55:51 @navikakumar where is the agreement signed with oil country they given oil @ 23 usd on the long term contract on their visit to India
2981 2018-05-30 18:55:48 Rosemary essential oil, with Jamaican castor oil. Rub it in the lil area that's not connecting with like a lil toothbrush!
2982 2018-05-30 18:55:44 Got in my car and my dad got the oil changed, washed it, vacuumed, and filled my tank. He’s truly the best.
2983 2018-05-30 18:55:40 My life really hasn’t been the same since i misplaced my coconut oil
2984 2018-05-30 18:55:33 Put oil on it
2985 2018-05-30 18:55:31 Today wasn’t a very good day. Let me put some coconut oil on it and see how it’ll be tomorrow.
2986 2018-05-30 18:55:31 I've been listening to a lot of Midnight Oil lately, Diesel and Dust is their only album I actually own though and I should probably fix that
2987 2018-05-30 18:55:28 Oil to vinegar ratio preference: 
2988 2018-05-30 18:55:28 Brent Crude Oil went up globally so the price of petrol inevitably went up. A few more fuel increases and I see families going hungry because this affects our food prices as well.
2989 2018-05-30 18:55:26 There are certainly VERY gifted doctors and life saving medications! Many made me worse, God lead me to a Christian doctor who has been seeing miracle after miracle with all natural God grown cbd made into an oil and it cured me in a month! Continued prayers and guidance! 
2990 2018-05-30 18:55:22 ASIAN GREEN OIL HELPS SO MUCH OMG I CAN BREATHE AGAIN
2991 2018-05-30 18:55:21 Going Naija style:
Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa exports, refines it in Ghana & then imports
2992 2018-05-30 18:55:19 Mafuta ya shamba sasa itaisha soko coz of easily available crude oil. Farm cartels wataumia kama watu wa sawmills.
2993 2018-05-30 18:55:06 LMFAO! Gas didn't start rising until Trump policies were set in motion! He wants higher Gas prices for his 'Oil & Gas' billionaire buddies. I live right in the middle of them. I get paid to deal poker w/them. Get real!

2995 2018-05-30 18:54:59 tea tree oil is my holy grail for skincare that shit is magical 
2996 2018-05-30 18:54:53 Part of the reason so little oil is shipped abroad from Burnaby is capacity constraints in the TM pipeline. With more capacity, more will be shipped at world prices minus shipping cost. The discount our oil faces has been exaggerated. Neither side has been truthful & accurate.
2997 2018-05-30 18:54:53 .......WILL THIS INVLUDE CBD OIL?...ANYONE KNOW?.........
2998 2018-05-30 18:54:50 Iran seeks OPEC support against US sanctions. 

How's that supposed to work? If they think Trump is bad, wait till they try talking to MBS of Saudi Arabia.
#Iran #Oil #Sanctions #OPEC #MBS #SaudiArabia
2999 2018-05-30 18:54:43 I remember seeing coconut oil praised on twitter & under skin care threads so I tried it and it gave me little hives all over my face :c
3000 2018-05-30 18:54:42 I can’t recall that piece of BS. What date? Explain further you snake oil salesman.
3001 2018-05-30 18:54:40 All I know is to put in gas, change the oil. Lol.
3002 2018-05-30 18:54:35 Spinoza in bright, thick oil paints.
3003 2018-05-30 18:54:35 Show me which "liberal" city is currently drilling for oil, fracking, dumping manufacturing waste into rivers or decommissioning wildlife reserves.
3004 2018-05-30 18:54:23 Hitler is dead in case you didn't know.
3005 2018-05-30 18:54:18 Nothing new or gross.  Just Snake oil, thats all.

THEY are the ones to vent ire about being $ driven & promising rainbows. They're poised to come out of woodwork
3008 2018-05-30 18:53:30 @ndtvvideos  Pappu Bhai , Modi doesn't control oil pls get that straight
3009 2018-05-30 18:53:17 Presumably filled with oil or fat for echo location?
3010 2018-05-30 18:53:17 I had two processed food biscuits and two cups of coconut oil coffee.

An apple and tablespoon of peanut butter!! 

I'm hungry :-(

Bout to have a big glass of water and it's not looking like LOGIC will PREVAIL...SAVED BY COMMON SENSE!!!

LEFTOVER CHICKEN SOUP!!!

3012 2018-05-30 18:52:58 Always thought it weird they used two stroke motor oil for their bikes, who knew?
3013 2018-05-30 18:52:55 "It's simple.  You need the cake mix you'd want then an egg,  oil and water.  You follow the directions on the box."
3014 2018-05-30 18:52:47 Very loud heckling from opposition benches when PM Trudeau answers a question about oil spills, with, “Mr. Speaker, I spent my summers on the B.C. coast...”
3015 2018-05-30 18:52:45 Canadians need to remember oil, minerals, and lumber pay the bills in this country. Unless we do something that resembles actual leadership (free STEM degrees) we are beholden to the world’s desire for resources. Otherwise we will be poor and powerless w/in a generation #cdnpoli
3016 2018-05-30 18:52:43 Except we are a constitutional republic. If they don’t work, remove them first, THEN try new ones that are Constitutional. All the “common sense” laws anti2A folks want are either already law or unconstitutional, so there’s that. Enforce what we have and punish the law breakers.
3017 2018-05-30 18:52:40 IMO, the reason there is such a push for gun control in this country is, Once we are no longer in control of oil being traded in US dollars, which will result in this US economy crashing, which will result to crime and chaos across this nation, they need to have guns confiscated.
3018 2018-05-30 18:52:32 I used it last night! Sautéed lightly floured chicken. Made angel hair pasta mixed with a little oil and tomatoes. And a sauce with sautéed onions, lemon zest, chicken broth, butter and a splash of cream. Delish!
3019 2018-05-30 18:52:30 I asked Austin to put sunblock on me as we sat in the 90 degree heat on the beach and he did, but at this point he sucked at it so much and I’m so badly burnt that I think it would have been better if I put on cooking oil
3020 2018-05-30 18:52:27 The only way the oil discovery in the north of Kenya will benefit me is lower pump prices, all that improve the economy bullshit they can keep.

3022 2018-05-30 18:52:08 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their mom didn't wake them up
3023 2018-05-30 18:51:58 Oil and gas royalties have brought more than $312 million to New Mexico for conservation and wildlife protection efforts.
3024 2018-05-30 18:51:49 Watching pirates of Nigeria, you can get an idea on how you'll highjack trailers transporting crude oil from Lokichar , siphon and make your own diesel,
3025 2018-05-30 18:51:45 This is a huge challenge. Senator Murkowski loves both sides and she’s addicted to oil. She’s married to the Republicans and they are a bunch of anti science, anti scientist, climate deniers. We wish you and #Alaska all the best.
3026 2018-05-30 18:51:40 Can't speak to Standard Oil. MSFT's internal factions (Windows, Office, Web/Xbox/misc) prevented each other from innovating out of fear of cannibalization. While MSFT factions waged pissing match, GOOG and Apple focused and redirected defensive marketing funds on R&D.
3027 2018-05-30 18:51:34 Mr Hegde, the problem is not petrol prices per se. Cos of high fuel prices, the prices of all essential commodities have gone up. Bus fares, the common man's transport, have more than doubled. Edible oil is Rs90/ltr. Good Aatta is Rs35/Kg.
3028 2018-05-30 18:51:18 I am kind of in the same ballpark. Thank you
3029 2018-05-30 18:51:15 I agree on all points, we disagree that I think the rest of the country is MORE dependent on CA than CA is on them, its a question of degrees- I’m in LA oil industry left for houston, bad education & corruption drove away biz, only tourism remains which should be extra not the 
3030 2018-05-30 18:51:15 My coworker gave me a bottle of fresh basil infused olive oil. I can't stop smelling it. Fresh basil is my favorite scent ever. I look like a crazy person sniffing a bottle at work.
3031 2018-05-30 18:51:04 OPEC’s nice but futile promise to raise oil  production by a million barrels a day may make the market feel better,  but it is not going to be enough to fill the supply void. Global markets  remain tight and we are seeing a big correction in what is a  longer-term bull market.
3032 2018-05-30 18:51:01 Kilamba is still largely empty (though better than it was in 2012), but the reasons behind this are rather more complex than people realise - ostensibly it was built to solve the housing shortage but in effect it's little more than a Chinese oil-for-infrastructure 'investment'.
3033 2018-05-30 18:51:01 What about me says hit on me while you’re changing my oil
3034 2018-05-30 18:50:57 IMO, the reason there is such a push for gun control in this country is, Once we are no longer in control of oil being traded in US dollars, which will result in this US economy crashing, which will result to crime and chaos across this nation, they need to have guns confiscated.
3035 2018-05-30 18:50:52 my fave I got was "coconut oil AF"
3036 2018-05-30 18:50:52 He liberated Syria of terrorists.What is so bad about Assad.America destroyed Iraq for oil and is supporting countries like Saudi Arabia who fund Wahabbist terrorists around the world.
3037 2018-05-30 18:50:49 Also, “deficits don’t matter” for nations that can print domestic currency for critical imports.  CNY oil contract has begun changing this...
3038 2018-05-30 18:50:42 Oil prices are trying to stabilize as the market is reeling from the  seasonal peak in the gasoline switchover, a potential rise in OPEC and  Non-OPEC production and sanctions on China. Tough talk on NAFTA  negotiations as well as a created political crisis in Italy.
3039 2018-05-30 18:50:26 Actually that’s a bold face lie that girl got new windshield wipers, a oil change, new air filters and front brakes this month  if anybody has been neglected it’d be myself

3041 2018-05-30 18:50:16 Really...Kerala government has done a huge favour to the public by reducing oil prices by Re. 1. Politics of symbolism. No??
3042 2018-05-30 18:50:07 I read something about putting butter or olive oil on your legs and use a butter knife to scrape them off. Idk if it works but worth a shot 
3043 2018-05-30 18:49:58 That is sooooo ass backwards!!!!

3046 2018-05-30 18:49:49 majority of essential oils stink lol. like, can I just get an 8 pack of lavender oil please? I don't want my home smelling like frankincense..
3047 2018-05-30 18:49:37 One bright spot is there are a lot of liberals out of work now. A leftist makes same " mistake" a simple apology works. Not so here.
3048 2018-05-30 18:49:33 Nigga wtf no fck that age what kinda oil is it?
3049 2018-05-30 18:49:28 The guys who own Porsche Kenya/Bentley Kenya dealerships and Multiple Hauliers are about to become ALOT wealthier. They have been contracted to transport crude oil from Turkana.
3050 2018-05-30 18:49:27 Yeah he got you and pretty sure @Jason_Kenny   It wasn’t until Tom in the final that he got beat.
3051 2018-05-30 18:49:15 Saudi did purchase the largest oil refinery in Texas. Has worked along with many to push vile islam into America’s public education system. What could go wrong?
3052 2018-05-30 18:49:14 When no one understands the oil industry or oil economics, & no one wants to DO anything abt their carbon footprint & dependency on fossil fuels, but everyone wants fuel cheap, bcz it is their birth right. Bcz who gives a damn about global warming

3053 2018-05-30 18:49:13 We applaud Starbucks but do not address 34 million Americans living in 3rd world poverty here- we scream racist but ignore the slave trade in Libya that our govt caused by its illegal invasion- we yell Muslim hater but ignore we killed 500 000 in Syria for oil - We are APES

After  eaten I tell her a story how David kill goliath 
3056 2018-05-30 18:48:49 Plz let me know if you know of a good place in Baytown to get an oil change.
3057 2018-05-30 18:48:39 It’s put your coconut oil in the fridge season.
3058 2018-05-30 18:48:31 As of now oil production in Libya has fallen to extremely low levels as militias are fighting over key oil facilities. Libya produces 700,000 barrels a day which is not even close to the production levels under Gaddafi.
3059 2018-05-30 18:48:27 Need some wild growth oil. Cuz I’m giving myself a year to double my length.
3060 2018-05-30 18:48:25 Agreed!  It's like an intersection where people always run the stop sign. Democrats want to put up another stop sign since one did not work surely two will.......
3061 2018-05-30 18:48:13 lets not be stupid.  This is nowhere near the level of environmental destruction as what the Republican party down south is up to.  Get a grip. I'm not pro oil any more than greenpeace, but don't get effing ridiculos pls

3136 2018-05-30 18:42:53 Rayes: You guys opposed Motions to support TMX a whole bunch of times. Now the public's shelling out $4.5 billion.

3177 2018-05-30 18:38:52 I wrote 15 years ago that in the smoke-and-mirrors world of #OPEC 'yes' often means 'no'; reaffirming a production cut could translate into higher #oil output, and quite often 'support' equals to 'opposition'. As valid in 2003 as in 2018. #OOTT

3204 2018-05-30 18:36:17 Even spending in naira is not going to be that easy. I think we are going to be hit on the income and cost side. The whole shitshow is setup to erupt. Y'all should say a special prayer for the oil price every night before you sleep and at Sunday Service.

3206 2018-05-30 18:35:40 I find it funny and ironic. You make a post in favore of oil companies and the liberals attack you like the #nodapl idiots. Then you make a post to Boycott an oil company and the liberal's attack you in favore of the oil company.

3217 2018-05-30 18:34:43 Yes u can light them. BUT make sure it's artisanal NOT mass production. Those candles have additional additives that you never know. Be sure you can enjoy a nice and fresh/yummy essential oil based candle and get ur mood on and enjoy the candle light and aromas  
3218 2018-05-30 18:34:39 Wouldn’t trust Trump as far as I could throw him, the guys a snake oil salesmen who survives by manipulating the soft in the head. BTW I am British and proud that we have a judicial system that protects those that can’t protect themselves.
3219 2018-05-30 18:34:37 Yes. Palm oil is so unnecessary and causing deforestation like never seen and endangering many plant animal species . @IcelandFoods have banned it from their own products
3220 2018-05-30 18:34:35 That it is true, but poor people can also handle AK-47s.

Where does the money used to buy votes come from? Crude oil revenues.

Now, imagine a Nigeria with negligible crude oil revenues and loads of poor people.

3244 2018-05-30 18:33:02 CBD oil!  It’s the best thing ever. I take “SuperHemp ISO-150.” Finding a quality source is critical bc there’s a lot of garbage being sold. Good luck, my friend.

3250 2018-05-30 18:32:41 Know who is behind the pain at the pump... Big Oil just keeps raking in TrumpTax cash. In 2017, ExxonMobil reported a $5.9 billion tax benefit, while Chevron and Valero reported $2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.
3251 2018-05-30 18:32:39 Get with it, nothing anyone says will change Trudeau’s support for the Oil Barons. There is a lot of $ in this decision going into a numbered bank account somewhere  #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan #oilandgas
3252 2018-05-30 18:32:28 Estimated no of nysc enrollees in 1979 = 2000
Price of oil in 1979 = $25 per barrel (about $89 today)
Quantity of oil pumped in 1979 = 2.4 million barrels per day (more than today)
Estimated number of nysc enrollees today = 80,000
Price of oil today ~ $70 per barrel

Do the math

3266 2018-05-30 18:31:16 NO that was his goal ... we got it done just means Canadians paid 4.5 Billion to halt all Oil out of AB. Believing anything has changed is nonsense.  This line is never getting built with this government at the helm.
3267 2018-05-30 18:31:13 I’ve got 14 bbls in my garage I bought in ‘15, just waiting for oil to get to $80.
3268 2018-05-30 18:31:10 Are there essential oil reserves in Utah?

Can you process essential oil into essential gasoline?

How are we going to regulate the essential oil barons?

Are essential oil fires a problem?

Have we considered the environmental impact of essential fracking?
3269 2018-05-30 18:31:02 If you want regimes like Iran and Saudi Arabia to change without war, then build some pipelines and put Canadian oil on the market. They won’t be able to compete and will have to change their society’s in order to adapt.

3272 2018-05-30 18:30:33 Our co-founder Maria decided to turn her father’s olive oil into a brand and together with her partner Kamil, launched Olive Branch in the Summer of 2011. Her father works closely with the local community co-operative where his olives are pressed.

3291 2018-05-30 18:28:20 If we don’t accept they exist Ian the MSM will only scream that the snp are in denial .
Also not calculating oil and gas is a shrewd move
3292 2018-05-30 18:28:18 Is there an Elon Musk troll army that defends his reputation? There is a difference, in that at least Musk partially succeeds at innovating in a stagnant oligopolic industry dominated by the oil paradigm. It's a notable & progressive achievement.

3296 2018-05-30 18:27:49 When Republicans passed the TrumpTax, they gave a 40% tax break to Big Oil companies. But instead of passing those savings on to consumers in the form of lower gas prices, major oil companies have announced record stock buybacks and billions in profits!

3299 2018-05-30 18:27:42 So watching the beginning of #qp and the conservatives open with energy east pipeline shutdown questions.  Does it tell us that they heard from western oil sector and how hard they pursued the KM purchase yesterday.
3300 2018-05-30 18:27:41 I think Alberta is following a "pump and dump" strategy. Spinners pump as much hot air as needed to keep the bubble aloft while the Oil Deep State facilitates dumping of liabilities to the public. Big shots move to the next conquest while locals are left to clean up the mess.
3301 2018-05-30 18:27:40 It gave the oil a nice flavour 
3302 2018-05-30 18:27:36 Its a fancy name for "crude oil bonus" for bigger boys.

3306 2018-05-30 18:27:04 at the moment oil is not that expensive but the ridiculous duty structure has created havoc and god forbid if crude was to touch historical highs..not to mention the mockery that has been made out of deregulation..
3307 2018-05-30 18:27:00 And we have some of the cheapest food costs in the world. Last I saw Americans spend around 12% of income on food. Others 50% +
3308 2018-05-30 18:26:57 Beige Book: Wage gains uneven and not large in aggregate; inflation picking up, despite lack of wage gains. Tariffs on steel and higher oil prices adding to inflation pressures: manufacturing on an upswing. Oil booming again.
3309 2018-05-30 18:26:57 This is another reason why pharmaceutical companies continue to rank the lowest amongst consumers just above government and passing Oil & gas 3 years in a row. Ambien does affect your alertness. @sanofius you are officially despicable! - @ScottAdamsSays

3327 2018-05-30 18:25:56 Thank you Mr. President. You're doing a great job. 

Please check up on the oil companies they're gouging us on gas prices.

3329 2018-05-30 18:25:54 Reefer madness come out with another study myth to pay for? Need a concussion or brain surgery paying taxes & studying 21st century #cannascience? How much would a 50 gallon barrel of Alberta growing organic oil be on the open market, competing with BC & Ontario greenhouses?
3330 2018-05-30 18:25:46 Sorry.  Not going to get built. Lieberals want to stick it to the west and Soros needs to control oil.
3331 2018-05-30 18:25:46 Interesting that with the canadian dollar at a significant discount, and oil industry in tatters, canada didnt grow manufacturing sector. In hindsight it disproves Mulclairs "dutch disease" claim.

3341 2018-05-30 18:24:11 My advice is buy the oil yourself and filter and take it to a place and you’ll save like 20 bucks but yours is full synthetic so if you take it to a shop it will always be around 70 bucks.
3342 2018-05-30 18:24:10 I do make my own. 250g strong white flour and a pinch of salt. Dissolve 2 tsp sugar in 180ml of lukewarm water, then stir in half a sachet of instant yeast and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Add the wet mixture to the dry. Knead to a smooth dough. Cover and let rise for 2 hours

3349 2018-05-30 18:23:35 Interesting.  Seems like you could replace "MFSP" with "LMR" and "oil sands mine" with "oil and gas", and it would justify the lack of changes to AER Directive 006 and 011 as well.

3359 2018-05-30 18:22:44 Warren, give a legal reasoning for having an impotent, virtual government take over real world control of a oil pipeline. The same pipeline they are trying to kill through paid activists. With their pedigree they are likely acting in bad faith, and will bankrupt the venture

3387 2018-05-30 18:19:31 The goal is too make wind and Solar more reliable... so you are looking to control weather... because that's the only way to make them reliable... And Oil is very reliable.   And more cost effective than your renewables
3388 2018-05-30 18:19:25 So important! Not like it was when I was a kid. Beach, sun and baby oil 
3389 2018-05-30 18:19:14 About time, oil change is really important  :-P
3390 2018-05-30 18:19:13 They never made me believe it was just a job, I believe and still believe that I was part of a force of good.

3403 2018-05-30 18:18:24 Risk/reward yes. 
But grains have a peculiarity where intrinsic value is important. Add in fact harvest is going on somewhere in the world nearly every day and idea we are "barely keeping up" falls a bit flat. 
We are no more going to run out of grain than we will run out of oil.

3418 2018-05-30 18:16:37 Even if international crude prices are rising, can’t Indian petroleum companies, which are public sector companies, absorb the hike till they reach no profit no loss stage?  Why should Govt look for earning from tax on petrol as well as dividend from oil companies.

3436 2018-05-30 18:14:52 Part of maintaining your oil storage tank involves keeping a certain level of oil in the tank at all times (usually around a quarter of a tank). Running low on oil can cause sediment buildup in the bottom of the tank to be pumped into the fuel line, clogging both your filters...
3437 2018-05-30 18:14:52 People who are against it for medicinal use need to understand that they can remove the thc (what gets you high) and you are left with cannabinadol that is proven to heal. So the 'it's a drug' argument shouldn't stand for medicinal use as cannabinadol oil doesn't get you high

3451 2018-05-30 18:13:01 Well depends on the oil. 98% of oils on the market only are required by FDA to contain 5% of the actual oil. You need pure oil, first. Yes, cats are stinkers with oils, there are some you can use. Everyone is different, just like with medicine.
3452 2018-05-30 18:12:56 I agree, but there is always a way to leave. Job opportunities, military, pipeline, oil rigs. I always tell people to leave the first chance they get or you never will. I have several buddies who never wanna leave their hometown and that’s fine, but that ain’t for me

On one hand, oil major part of the economy for short-term, no sense in taking a discount for existing industry while we fund low-carbon econ. Other hand, world needs to get off oil, stop fossil fuel subsidies
3461 2018-05-30 18:12:25 Like fish oil capsules
3462 2018-05-30 18:12:25 #oott we are sellers of #oil think we head lower for longer.
3463 2018-05-30 18:12:24 Exactly!  Sooooooo many things can be treated with cannabis oil.
3464 2018-05-30 18:12:19 @SenateMajLdr Majority Leader McConnell, please do something to lower or stop the Oil Company's from ripping the American Working Class off every summer at the gas  pump. It's time our Congress Member's start taking care of the voter's. We will remember at the polls in 2018.
3465 2018-05-30 18:12:03 @RahulGandhi 
request you as u r president of a old, reputed party,  to issue a statement and demand  from central / state govt to bring the oil prices under GST.

3472 2018-05-30 18:11:01 I guess you’ve never seen the liquids that come from a battery. Go roll around in some oil and some battery acid and let me know how that turns out.
3473 2018-05-30 18:11:00 In letter sent Saturday to OPEC, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh demanded that the cartel support Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions, calling them "illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial." - WSJ. #OOTT

3476 2018-05-30 18:10:46 Trim ends, and steam to preferred state (I like them fully cooked but a bit crisp). Mix some mayonnaise with a bit of sesame oil and soy sauce to flavor. Serve with a dollop of the mayo mix on the side.

3479 2018-05-30 18:10:36 On 23rd May, 18, brent crude oil price reached to $ 80 p/barrel. But after Russia n Saudi Arabia agreed to enhance oil production, it reached to $ 75 p/barrel in five days i.e. on 28th May, 18. And what relief we got from Modi govt is Rs. one p/ltr. Applaud!!! #EkPaiseKiSarkar
3480 2018-05-30 18:10:29 Indeed. It will also help build GHG emissions so much that the oil sands alone will account for almost 20% of Canada's TOTAL emissions by 2030. And that is under Alberta's so-called "hard cap" on emissions. 
Pick up those tools folks! We have a pipeline to fight! #stopkm
3481 2018-05-30 18:10:28 You recycled a report that originated from NNPC stakeholder's forum published in 2017. Only THISDAY used "current government." It speaks volumes that u swallowed $3Billion was spent, in 2yrs, in a recession searching for oil. I would have been surprised if facts doesnt offend u.

3487 2018-05-30 18:09:41 If there is no market value, we get 0. BC residents were always going to subsidize toll rates. Canada imports a lighter oil to dilute the bitumen so it will flow in the pipelines. All those tankers shipping oil back and forth across the ocean will soon be using a higher grade oil

3489 2018-05-30 18:09:29 okay where tf do people get oil changes from for $40 because this is the 2nd different place i’ve gone that it is $70??
3490 2018-05-30 18:09:13 Really? BECAUSE it seems less volatile than Petrol... Anybody else lose half their net worth on oil? Gold will always have value. When the market is good, gold is in stagnation, when the market is volatile- gold is king. Don't make the mistake and believe the market is perpetual.
3491 2018-05-30 18:09:12 The park land was a BO land grab that was inaccessible to ppl. Would’ve cost more to open it 4 ppl than 2 sell it 2 oil co. We need energy-not more parks. The “children to be separated from their families” was a threat to dissuade illegals from coming in the 1st place.
3492 2018-05-30 18:09:08 How much oil is spilled in an electric car accident? Just wondering
3493 2018-05-30 18:09:06 Too much oil lol

3495 2018-05-30 18:08:54 @SpeakerRyan I am asking as a Hard Working American who can not afford to pay these gasoline increased at the pump. I'm asking Congress please to do something about the Oil Company's ripping Working Glass off every summer. This is Ridiculous! Please help. Thank you

3503 2018-05-30 18:07:55 Or... perhaps you could protest the Democrat Assembly candidate that is endorsed and supported by local big oil...
3504 2018-05-30 18:07:49 Isn't that why you're a perfume oil seller?
3505 2018-05-30 18:07:46 I hope it's a little like an oil tanker The bridge has given orders but it's going to take some time to turn around. Watch out for those rocks, and let's hope the captain wasn't formerly in charge of the Costa Concordia.
3506 2018-05-30 18:07:41 He can bark because he is a dog as per congis..I guess ppls mandate gayi tel lene when a myopic court burnt midnight oil to deliver justice...
3507 2018-05-30 18:07:33 KM did not care about that issue as the pipeline was fully contracted, which means they get their t-fee's regardless of whether companies are able to move their product. It's the Oil Producer who would be on the hook. And the oil producers (i.e the Suncores) want the pipeline.
3508 2018-05-30 18:07:26 I use tree tea oil too at night & mix it with water for my hair. I alternate that and Apple cider vinegar.
3509 2018-05-30 18:07:16 In 1892 the Geneva convention the Rockefellers decided to declare it to be fossil fuel to make oil more scarce. The fact is that oil is made of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon with is found in every living organisms. Tree's grass,weeds. No Dinosaur fossils have never been found.
3510 2018-05-30 18:07:13 Country crock is "solid" oil dude

Like no one should eat Country Crock. It's an abomination.
3511 2018-05-30 18:07:09 @SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan, as a middle class hard working American. These increased gasoline price's are really making it difficult for me to put food on the table. It was nice getting the tax cut's. But looks like the rich greedy oil company's are taking that out of our pockets
3512 2018-05-30 18:07:05 45. Determined to diversify our economy form overdependence on oil, we hvmade huge gains in agriculture. To date, work is on-going in the following projects: the 11,000 hectares coconut plantation; and 16,000 hectares cassava plantation in 15 LGA’s.

3514 2018-05-30 18:06:55 Irony of a snake oil salesman signing a bill that will mostly be used to sell snake oil.
3515 2018-05-30 18:06:38 Borrowed it from your dad fam baby oil soon come
3516 2018-05-30 18:06:37 Yes 4 lines were built under PM Harper, but in all fairness they were through supportive regions. The issue is getting oil to tidewater, which no Gov.  has done. I’m also curious to where all this Conservative dissent was when Harper bailed out the Auto Industry for Billions?
3517 2018-05-30 18:06:37 Barrels of oil with a giant ruler in the background.
3518 2018-05-30 18:06:35 That was not a tanker spill. It came from a grain ship. Nobody likes oil spills but your example is comparing apples to oranges.
3519 2018-05-30 18:06:32 Hopefully Mr ball can follow in the footsteps of his leader and finish the exploration wells drilled in Newfoundland, and see what might be great and great future for oil and gas on land in our great province of Newfoundland

3526 2018-05-30 18:06:13 55 wasn't arbitrary it had to do with the oil crisis.  I get the feeling "I'm speeding as a form of civic protest against an unjust law" is a load of horse shit.
3527 2018-05-30 18:05:52 Grill?  They should boil him in oil.
3528 2018-05-30 18:05:47 It’s actually my second time using oil paints, i’m quite proud of myself ahaha

5 -Reforms in health sector hospitalisation where as hospitals lack basic facilities even medicine and trained staff.
3536 2018-05-30 18:05:03 His disregard for our land and parks kissing up to big oil. How he handle PV. Allowing children to be separated from their family’s. Kissing up to big pharma. Wanting a f***g military parade like a dictator. No ideas for aca just making sure it fails. On and on and on
3537 2018-05-30 18:05:00 Fellas, does beard oil work? What should I use?
3538 2018-05-30 18:04:54 and a shortage of food (as Germany faced then, and as America may well face during a crisis of our own idiotic making, especially given how deregulation can ruin food and fresh water sources with oil, fracking, and the like), & those millions of prisoners will meet the same fate.

3540 2018-05-30 18:04:42 Given your usual view points I am distressed by finding common ground here.
If we dont need their oil does that mean you support alternatives like solar and molten salt nuclear?
3541 2018-05-30 18:04:42 What was crude oil prices then.
3542 2018-05-30 18:04:29 I thought you said the oil industry was the heart of our economy.... Doesn't that mean we have allowed a foreign state to control a significant part our economy?

3544 2018-05-30 18:04:04 Is it a specific brand or does it just say bio oil ?
3545 2018-05-30 18:04:01 This opens the door for all the snake oil salesmen.
3546 2018-05-30 18:04:00 But we would have got all the oil money squandered over the years but as you say we might not get channel 4 building which we haven't got..some people

3550 2018-05-30 18:03:38 @VP Hard Working American's can not afford gas price increase's. We are tried of these rich oil company's stealing money out of the pockets of hard working American's. Oil Company's need to stop gauging American Workers. Ridiculous, they have no same. Just greedy as heck.
3551 2018-05-30 18:03:25 It is also easy to see that vegetables behave like photovoltaic cells, instead of storing solar radiation as electrical energy, they store it as chemical energy (sugars=carbohydrates).And this is the essential value of Carbon, oil &gas in the cycle of life. You will miss them!!!.

3557 2018-05-30 18:03:05 Had car jumped, brought to get brakes fixed, probably new battery, oil change, fluids checked, tires aired. It’ll all be good $ wise, right? .... right????  oh Lord.

3580 2018-05-30 18:01:06 you and the oil companies insulted a common man of india with this "one paisa less" mockery. take this as a citizen's word, u will pay for ur chair. u tested our patience with price rise of nonsense reasons, we shall get back to u on time @narendramodi @BJP4India @AmitShah
3581 2018-05-30 18:01:01 Then you dont understand the difference in geography for job ranges. Or that smaller contractors have to undercut big oil to stay afloat and where do u think that undercut comes from?
3582 2018-05-30 18:00:53 I voted for and support my president @realDonaldTrump but if we are exporting oil why the hell is the gas prices going thru the roof taking any extra money we might have. Just saying we took a lot of regulations off them to help them and now they stick it right up our tail pipe.

3590 2018-05-30 17:59:50 Good journalism, on one hand, minister says oil companies are autonomous and there is daily review of prices and on other hand, the prices are not changed for 19 days. What a farce!! Minister should and if he cannot someone like Modi or Shah must tell people why this loot??
3591 2018-05-30 17:59:49 And many aren't and don't.
The risks are massive,
The benefits limited. 
We should not be expanding - we should be refining. There's no reason we can't have a couple of refineries built and use our oil and gas to benefit Canada instead of shipping it low cost to someone else.

3596 2018-05-30 17:59:27 The competition comes from LOOP VLCCs in the Gulf of Mexico that recently started shipping oil to China. Much cheaper. If you are a Chinese importer, which would you choose? KM saw the writing on the wall, IMHO.
3597 2018-05-30 17:59:27 Got back from Chicago and my car battery is dead and need to be replaced and I need an oil change and we need grocery shopping and rent is due in 2 days. AWESOME.
3598 2018-05-30 17:59:23 You are supposed to unite people, NOT use inflammatory speech and throw oil on the fire.

3600 2018-05-30 17:59:19 @SenateMajLdr Noticed Oil Company's raised price's! Causing gasoline prices to considerably increase on voter's right in the middle of election year. If Republican's don't get those prices down. It will cost seats.
3601 2018-05-30 17:59:19 Watch consensus-worshipers DENY that it used to be ABSOLUTE CONSENSUS:
- Students of 1960's PROVABLY would not live past 30 years old, nuke war
- Oil would be completely depleted by 1980
- Earth's food supply would not sustain us past 2000
- American MFG particulates = ICE AGE
3602 2018-05-30 17:59:08 So what you’re saying is that an oil spilled would make water wet?

3605 2018-05-30 17:58:50 @canabaoil hi guys do you produce cbd oil or can you recommend an Irish producer - would love to try it for joint pain. Thanks ;)
3606 2018-05-30 17:58:45 "Capping oil sands emissions". Translation = allowing emissions to increase 40% to 100 Mt/yr. This amounts to 20% of Canada's TOTAL allowable emissions by 2030 under Paris targets just so oil sands can expand. All other industries/provinces will have to cut emissions massively.
3607 2018-05-30 17:58:40 ..."unscrupulous snake oil salespeople seeking profits"...
Just as it has been all along! What's the difference? At least now people are given another choice but still need to do some kind of homework trying to filter out the snake oil sales people!
3608 2018-05-30 17:58:30 ONLY avocado, cherry tomatoes, salt, onion powder, vegetable oil, high-fructose corn syrup, xanthan gum and E236. Everything else spoils the recipe.
3609 2018-05-30 17:58:27 Very good, the change is coming for the energy sector. Oil has a false price only speculation and political pressure. The reduction in the use is a must.

3613 2018-05-30 17:58:23 Says the governor whose state boasts five refineries importing oil, most of it tankers from Alaska, and who benefit from keeping Canadian oil landlocked. MYOB.

3615 2018-05-30 17:58:09 How sad. "Republicans" voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling....
3616 2018-05-30 17:57:58 When oil prices were plummeting to new lows, I honestly didn't want the government to decrease prices: 
1. It was extra money to govt
2. Demand-supply meant lower prices would pump up consumption
But when crude prices go up, govt eating away the free excise duty money is cruel!

3620 2018-05-30 17:57:44 If you think the TPM pipeline is not getting built, or that Saudi, Kuwait,Iran,Iraq and Venezuela will not sell the Chinese the same oil, you are irrational and naive. Medicare, child-care, pensions, expanded social programs require money. Canada's oil is the key.

You have to establish that whatever gun control you favor would actually save lives. And you should stop assuming that those who support gun rights don't care about innocent deaths.

3720 2018-05-30 17:49:01 Ima be a gay stripper go and dance for the ladies put some oil all over my body and make this shit happen club 20/20 catch me there 
3721 2018-05-30 17:48:59 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
3722 2018-05-30 17:48:58 Canabis lotion/oil is VERY different than regular marijuana.  I’m not wrong.  Look at the effects of legalization in states. See how the death toll rises from drivers under the Influence?
3723 2018-05-30 17:48:54 I started researching it too. every now and then I'll throw some raw egg and chicken in with her food, along with some coconut oil.  I try to keep her snacks and treats as clean as possible though.

3728 2018-05-30 17:48:34 That could be true.  Our number one importer of Oil is Canada followed by Mexico.  The biggest problem with the cost of fuel is Gas Tax and EPA fees. Its actually cheaper to import .
3729 2018-05-30 17:48:32 adulting. called the car repair guy that comes out to peoples houses to fix car. he's coming out to jump the car. car needs oil change too but he'll probably come out later for that.
3730 2018-05-30 17:48:32 @BillNye Feathers! Feathers Bill!! They hold the power to clean up many types of OIL!! My "crude" experiments suggest one pound of feathers can remove 100 lbs of oil from water when reused.  Spent feathers can be "seeded" for natural degradation.
3731 2018-05-30 17:48:30 
3732 2018-05-30 17:48:17 This may or may not contain an element of truth.
3733 2018-05-30 17:48:17 Must be a commodity situation like oil. Don’t think Europe has any!
3734 2018-05-30 17:48:00 本格的には，IronやSteelの研磨でも，表面のムラを最小限にするために，何らかのOilを塗ったのち，ああいった「研ぎ石」にかける。そのOilの塗り方も，経験が求められたりするがね。多すぎたら逆効果，少なすぎてもムラになる，とかで。
しかし Alminium はそれが「塗れない」んだ。油だから #Apple
3735 2018-05-30 17:47:53 You need to go slowly with it and lighten up gradually over the course of a few weeks. Pick a lower strength bleach nothing above a 40. Treat your hair with coconut oil to rehydrate it, I recommend putting the oil on and then putting on a shower cap and sleeping with the oil in.
3736 2018-05-30 17:47:53 So we should be cool with Iran because they flooded the market with oil? Is this before or after they kidnapped our sailors? Or when the Hussein administration sent them pallets of cash? The #irandeal was a mistake to begin with. Just like the Hussein administration. #MAGA
3737 2018-05-30 17:47:52 Make sure it’s hot enough, put some baby powder on before starting the waxing and afterwards use some oil to clean up the wax and it’ll calm your skin. It won’t hurt THAT much so you don’t need medicine or anything I think

3740 2018-05-30 17:47:37 I guess America forgot about oil prices hitting all time highs on George Bush’s last year in office making his oil buddies even more rich while we suffered with ridiculous gas prices!
3741 2018-05-30 17:47:28 One of the biggest event in Nigeria Oil and Gas sector is coming up. Be part of it.
3742 2018-05-30 17:47:26 Why do you think they were cheated? They came out as Republicans? Isn’t the all education system just a weapon for the leftists to bring the rule socialism/ communism to us? Why should we pay for it? Or did you find money growing tree? Or can you use oil revenue for that? Fraud
3743 2018-05-30 17:47:13 Shakshuka: Chop onion, garlic, chilli & red pepper. Fry in olive oil until onions are golden. Stir in tomatoes, sweet paprika & cumin, cook until thickened. Season with s&p. Make 4 indents, crack an egg into each, cover & cook until eggs are as you like. Serve with flatbreads.
3744 2018-05-30 17:47:08 Hahahahaha; ok, this one is so incredibly stupid that it really is laughable.  Even the snake oil salesman is shaking his head over this con man!
3745 2018-05-30 17:47:04 A3 Just our 24th anniversary trip. Oil change if needed, tires checked, cleaned out car... #LetsMasterThis
3746 2018-05-30 17:47:03 I didn't know olive oil bottles could break.
3747 2018-05-30 17:47:00 How about more refineries in #Canada so we don't import oil from Imperial America............... #cdnpoli

3749 2018-05-30 17:46:48 Calipari is such a snake oil salesman. You think EJ Montgomery would have picked UK knowing they would go and sign one of the top big men in all NCAA as a transfer. Doubt it.
3750 2018-05-30 17:46:43 Chef Kawasaki cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with Play-Doh.
3751 2018-05-30 17:46:37 My mother used to put baby oil on us. Anyone who’s ever met me will understand why that was like deep frying a raw chicken. Should have had the social workers called.

3753 2018-05-30 17:46:15 Ok, our economy is running on oil prices? where went increased IT payers money?,black money disclosure scheme money? increased service tax? increased CESS?tax on temples?where went  Increased metro fare,rail fare? claimed lakhs of crore saving by adhar DBT?...
In your pocket?
3754 2018-05-30 17:46:12 I’d invest in big oil right now, guarantee ya Koch bros, Mnuchin, DJT, and all his corporate cronies are. They’re using policy to manipulate the markets for personal gains. The human rights excuse is just that, an excuse.
3755 2018-05-30 17:46:12 Not paranoid….  safe. I have never ever ever had a virus, or malware other than my TRUE router once got hacked and the DNS changed. AVs are snake oil, resource hogs and target rich themselves… don’t accept weird files or thumbdrives, and no av is necessary.

3757 2018-05-30 17:45:52 @Jlo_Too probably doesn't realize that nuclear offers a MILLION time the energy that oil does. Please @jlo_too, just look some things up that aren't from Anti-Nuke Weekly. You'll be happy and less stressed if you did.

3761 2018-05-30 17:45:38 Jim Traber would fake his own death just for the ad reads.  "I was 6ft under until I tried CBD oil and got a full heart and lung scan"
3762 2018-05-30 17:45:37 Because we are not in a position ourselves to judge the data, we have to trust the scientific process. When scientists in all countries, the NASA, US Army, even oil corporations all agree there is no doubt man causes global warming, then I am a bit puzzled to your skepticism.

3776 2018-05-30 17:44:07 I'm with you! I haven't talked to my vet about it either, but there is an over-the-counter PCR oil for dogs/cats that a friend of mine recommends. It tastes bland and is non-psychoactive. I've put my aging rats on it for a few weeks now. They like it and seem fine.
3777 2018-05-30 17:44:05 Man has survived without oil and coal for the longest time. But not water. Say no to wastage.

3795 2018-05-30 17:43:05 The Mass Democrats of the 1970's saved my family several times.  I can remember walking home from school in 0 degree weather hoping my mom was able to get the state to pay our oil heating bill or we would have no heat.  They came through...heat would be on.  Tough days back then
3796 2018-05-30 17:43:01 Another stupid doesn't know that the oil price is decided by oil companies and not the govt
3797 2018-05-30 17:42:58 Please stop your road shows till oil price is reduced. Heard enough speeches.
3798 2018-05-30 17:42:53 To be fair, I’ve seen just as many FN on BC worksites as I have on Alberta worksites as relating to oil and gas. I can’t speak to other industries, but I can speak of poverty I have observed when there’s no need. We should have jobs, clean water etc.
3799 2018-05-30 17:42:50 Pan-fry 'em with ginger and garlic and shallots in sesame oil. Super versatile that way so they'll go in rice bowls or as a side.

3806 2018-05-30 17:42:25 Well it’s Albertans oil not Ottawa’s! It’s Albertans who have sacrificed to get trudeau his UN seat! It’s the west who have allowed the states to make around 100 million a day off of Canadian oil with the profit margins on resale!
3807 2018-05-30 17:42:24 @Halfords_uk Hi my daughter received really shocking service at Halfords today. She asked for help to top up her oil and the chap went and got a 5 litre bottle without checking how much she needed. When I went to complain, Matt the assistant manager basically called her a liar!
3808 2018-05-30 17:42:23 Lol. I remember the 2 valve pouring out oil on to my leathers on my right ankle off the chain I think but didn't get it sideways due to the long bends. Remember after my first ride I was well happy.
3809 2018-05-30 17:42:20 Yeah, MFSP shows ~$28BB in 2017 but that is for coal and oil sands and the program does not give a good idea of a company's assets that should be countering the deposit requirements. Ticking time bomb that is going to be ugly to manage in the near and long term
3810 2018-05-30 17:42:15 Just another trudeau trying to nationalize Ab. oil again. The west needs to separate so people like @JustinTrudeau can not hurt us anymore by keeping us down and still using us like the easts piggy bank!!

3843 2018-05-30 17:40:10 Just thinking about how many deals were made made within the walls of The Edmonton Petroleum Club. And not just oil and gas. Business people and governments. Not these days though.
3844 2018-05-30 17:40:09 Sir,that’s done by Indian oil corporation,because of a clerical error.Don’t make Indian oil corporation a Modi’s company,it’s still public sector company,so blame it if you want to and know the facts before tweeting something,don’t just tweet for publicity.
3845 2018-05-30 17:40:09 Not sure but given how Fort Mac was blasted by the oil price drop last year, I would strongly recommend diversifying our investments rather than doubling down on an industry where most of the $ leave the country. Also if it was so good why did KM sell?
3846 2018-05-30 17:40:04 Oil Companies babus are provided with best salaries, perks and all luxuries. Is this not one of the reasons for price of fuel ??

3860 2018-05-30 17:39:15 If olive oil is made from olives,, What is baby oil made of?!!??? Asking for a friend.
3861 2018-05-30 17:39:14 Bitches will eat an entire fudge cake to themselves but won't cook with olive oil because it's 'not healthy'
3862 2018-05-30 17:39:12 Does cost of crude oil matters in rate of petrol ? If so petrol should be cheaper than it was in 2014.
3863 2018-05-30 17:39:09 Oh! Good idea!
3864 2018-05-30 17:39:03 A3. Oil change, tire rotation, making sure everything is safe and ready to go. Hoping to head to FL beach this summer

3876 2018-05-30 17:38:28 It is the difference between something whole, like a whole plant food ~a lemon, and the separation of its parts, which are not a whole plant food.
It's the difference between processed white sugar & unprocessed fruit with sugar inside. Or processed olive oil & unprocessed olives.

3917 2018-05-30 17:36:50 Remember that Russia is the world's 2nd biggest exporter of oil; RT has a vested interest in making sure we keep buying oil and will always try to discourage us frm driving #EVs .
RT is a strategic play by Russia and not responsible journalism.
3918 2018-05-30 17:36:48 Mexico has been one of our largest trading partners. We still to this day need 10 million barrels of oil per day (50% of our needs) We import it from Mexico mostly n some from Canada.

3926 2018-05-30 17:36:21 This might be good legislation if it weren’t for all that deregulation so there are few controls on the snake oil. That is a disaster in the making.

3932 2018-05-30 17:35:42 Fyi, there are companies online that ship cbd oil to all 50 states. Some good some bad, of course everyone needs to do their own research. Be well

3945 2018-05-30 17:34:32 Canadian oil production and consumption isn't going to change. It just means selling it to Asia and not Cheeto. And moving it in a much safer way then trains.

3948 2018-05-30 17:34:11 I’d like a refund on my taxes. I didn’t give the Canadian govt half of my income to buy an oil pipeline from a private company. It’s not your money @JustinTrudeau #pipeline #accountability

3950 2018-05-30 17:33:39 No, but you’re retarded for not understanding the definition of “experimental”- meaning it hasn’t been “shown” to help. That’s the whole point of the experimentation: To show something or not. 
I guess snake oil salesmen & the “poorly educated” who vote for them don’t care.

3953 2018-05-30 17:33:18 @matthewamiller  I’m sure you are aware by now that the rise in oil prices spurred by Trumps dropping out of the Iran deal, was to help Putin by increasing oil prices.
3954 2018-05-30 17:33:04 Rebel Media is still alive?   Is it like a single Battle Incel barely kept afloat by an oil drum in the Atlantic Ocean?

3956 2018-05-30 17:32:44 @ndtvvideos .. it's because of crude oil price down. Not because of your previous tweet paapu..... You don't have common sense.

3967 2018-05-30 17:31:43 Trump armed Ukraine to defend against Russia and bombed and killed 500 Russians in Syria. He moved the U.S. to take over the oil market in Europe where Russia did dominate, putting them out of business. How is he supporting Putin?
3968 2018-05-30 17:31:40 Good Luck !
3969 2018-05-30 17:31:39 BJP ruling  21 States should  set precedence  to reduce  OIL and gas  prices  if it is half  serious about  problems of  
the  commons .It can  boomerang. Don't  disregard 
the  feeling of the  comman man. Enough  of suffering from  so called  Ache Din  politics.
3970 2018-05-30 17:31:16 Respect need to protect Canada's west coast. Would it not be less divisive to work for increased safeguards instead of doing so much harm to Alberta by blocking export of its oil?

3982 2018-05-30 17:30:01 You'll take the oil to the port in South to refine outside Nigeria and return to north abi? Looking for more crude oil instead of fixing refineries. He is clueless
3983 2018-05-30 17:29:53 @WhiteHouse  When their call for the gift of FOOD, is not heard sufficiently, or met with food that is too expensive, they start to push oil prices in desperation. When this does not work sufficiently, their requests are paired with threats of nuclear FIRE. ReSa

3986 2018-05-30 17:29:41 Making my dinner right now since I have to work tonight.  Thanks to @randomusernames I have a new salad I'm in  with. Cucumbers, red onion, Feta cheese, homemade oil & red wine vinegar dressing. I just added red peppers, red cabbage and lettuce to it. Also a chicken breast.
3987 2018-05-30 17:29:40 Of the Holy Spirit of God upon one's person, the "Smearing of the Oil of God" upon one's person!  Amen.   And the divine Hebrew Israelite Jewish Holy Spirit of God declared to this spiritual editor that He was "Grease", and that He "greases' the people!  Amen.  (To be continued)
3988 2018-05-30 17:29:40 I argued with my MAGA brother who said they are nothelping themselves and that ports were destroyed so no ships could land to help..He added they couldn’t get telephone poles in or fuel oil so nobody could help. Now we see poor preparation and disinterest and thousands died.
3989 2018-05-30 17:29:40 Its hardly surprising Trump would organise a Bonanza for snake oil salesmen.

3992 2018-05-30 17:29:33 Ameen
3993 2018-05-30 17:29:32 Because the oil company’s don’t want their cars to be replaced by eco friendly cars like Tesla. Sad truth.
3994 2018-05-30 17:29:25 It's pretty hard to grow hair out now that I'm older and it makes me feel like an old lady, but trimming the ends works very well to stimulate the hair grow and massaging your scalp. My favorite oil to use is Jojoba but I also use a Korean Argan Oil mist that seals it.
3995 2018-05-30 17:29:20 Roughly mashed avocados, olive oil, salt and pepper. Garlic maybe. Not too much.

Today Canada s champion of hope died

4004 2018-05-30 17:28:41 I agree with you, we have a right too know. Maybe they're trying to prevent panic and keep order? They could have gotten away from oil yrs ago but the US dollar is propped up on the oil trade. Without oil trade the US dollar is worth 0. You see there is money at stake!

4023 2018-05-30 17:26:05 No.

Is that answer not enough?
Here's more:
Prices will come down gradually as it went up. International prices of crude oil is expected to come down owing to talks among oil producing nations to increase production in coming days. Have some patience.
4024 2018-05-30 17:26:02 Justin Trudeau reveals that Canada has a serious addiction problem, too. But, theirs spells trouble for all the rest of us. Yes, Justin, an intelligent country would indeed leave their oil in the ground.

4029 2018-05-30 17:25:38 No because great Britain didnt send military to iraq to help bush did we. Nooo. The only reason you send your military is to protect your country or get something your country wants. E.g. oil, land etc

4036 2018-05-30 17:25:05 Should do both. The assault on oil is misplaced and divisive. Worse, it distracts from the much tougher task of making renewables and replacement products more practical and effective.
4037 2018-05-30 17:24:53 Nooooo!!! I’m guessing as it’s oil it’s got no sun protection?

4050 2018-05-30 17:23:29 As an ex-boxer I naively expected @JustinTrudeau to show more courage than to throw his fight against climate change in round 1 & for just a handful of oil dollars.

Our government has habit,propping up giant oil companies with generous subsidies cushy tax cuts-habit that’s cost Canada billions dollars every year. We’re talking big money – 2011, the International Monetary Fund pegged Canada’s oil subsidies,$34 billion per year

4062 2018-05-30 17:22:02 Thx. Why is it unreasonable to assume Alberta oil companies es would not accept the extra cost of smaller tankers. The goal is to shrink the differential, not completely remove it.

4070 2018-05-30 17:21:19 OPEC is what is wrong. They are a cartel out to make money. Oil companies as well. It’s too long to tweet but with bigger gas guzzlers and travel the gas prices keep going up. Don’t forget taxes as well
4071 2018-05-30 17:21:09 Both. He seems to have forgotten what were his statements per 2014. What’s baffles me most, Bhakts are still not responding to oil price high. 
4072 2018-05-30 17:21:04 If god heals your cold make sure to remind him my truck has needed an oil change for about 3 months
4073 2018-05-30 17:21:01 Great pic! But it looks like the poor croc is living in an oil slick 
4074 2018-05-30 17:21:00 No Mr Trudeau it is not. If we refine Canadian oil in Canada then it is, and BC would like to have refineries on its lands for alberta oil produced by Canadian oil companies.

In 2014 the crude oil prices fall to 25$/. And the petrol prices are now 88 Rs.

So, does it means that Manmohan Gov. did handled the petrol prices more efficiently.

4106 2018-05-30 17:18:58 It's funny, during every debate government says oil companies decide prices independently. It's only during elections it seems these corporates hands are tied to their chair and prices don't budge with fluctuating crude prices
4107 2018-05-30 17:18:47 What laws allow the Feds to move oil across BC against their will but not allow us the move power across Quebec? I assume there are differences?
Anyone have an explanation?
4108 2018-05-30 17:18:44 What happens when credit freezes and trucks stop delivering to grocery stores? What happens when oil prices are too high because the value of the dollar is next to nothing and those same trucking companies can’t fill their tanks? This is just one example of things being affected.
4109 2018-05-30 17:18:43 No problem with tankers and oil in your state waters though. Your not big on science. One just has to look at your banning a viable industry like salmon farming from your waters after it had been there for years.

4120 2018-05-30 17:16:39 Permian players use of rail is limited because sand is using the same cars and track which means space for crude less available. Forcing more crude pushes up sand prices? Costs could just keep rising, so for now most expensive method is used by trucking.(which uses more oil!)

4159 2018-05-30 17:13:17 Never thought I'd spend 2 hours waiting on an oil change.  Only went to Walmart since I had to go to the bank.
4160 2018-05-30 17:13:14 President Manuel Santos announced that the Colombia’s status as “NATO’s global partner” will soon be formalized. The highly secretive 'Club of the Isles' dominates the world’s oil, banking, pharmaceutical and mining industries. This is a large-scale plan to conquer Venezuela!

4162 2018-05-30 17:13:09 That storey did not prove your information. If no one wanted Canadian oil companies wouldn't try and put pipelines into the ground like northern gate way so where is your delusional information coming from
4163 2018-05-30 17:13:02 Barter system is OK as in Wheat for Oil, but its a bit difficult to bypass Global Financial System. Even France's Total is withdrawing from Iran after sanctions being reimposed. Coz current Financial System is US oriented, dats the reality.
4164 2018-05-30 17:12:55 In 2013 : The crude oil prices were 110$/.And the petrol prices were 70 Rs

In 2014 : The crude oil prices were 25$/.And the petrol prices are now 88 Rs

So the two I named will be good for moisturizing and growth. But if you wanted fuller hair we can probably find out what oil can help that too

4248 2018-05-30 17:04:58 You forgot to mention coconut oil...
4249 2018-05-30 17:04:52 A small tube of oil paint is already like $15 bro.

4251 2018-05-30 17:04:41 The coastal influence. I find lot of similarity in goan / Mangalorean / Kerala cuisine. Diff may be in the oil used and the choice of spices.
4252 2018-05-30 17:04:40 Evangelicals are snake oil salesmen. They would ho from town to town hosting tent revivals pushing all that attend to give all they have for salvation. Their beliefs are an abomination. Jesus Christ truly weeps. If he came back like they say he will, they'd mock and deport him.

4257 2018-05-30 17:04:24 Also, a new Science paper is coming out from our group on this very topic in the next month, which takes a comprehensive view of US methane emissions from oil and gas. Will keep everyone posted.
4258 2018-05-30 17:04:23 Yes and your car is obviously a hybrid running off of electrical components. They had the technology to get a hundred and eighty miles a gallon in the 70s but the oil corporations bought the patent and destroyed it
4259 2018-05-30 17:04:16 Me too honestly. My hair used to be all the way to my butt and I chopped it off to my jaw line like two years ago. They might, but just pay attention to the ingredients if you do that. I’m picky and use extra virgin coconut oil and organic castor oil. Whatever your preference is
4260 2018-05-30 17:03:59 You got me there... learn to change yah damn tire, and oil, it’ll save you time and money
4261 2018-05-30 17:03:51 I just stated exactly what they've been hiding. Reservoirs have refilled. There's always new oil fields being found. It is not a finite resource.

4266 2018-05-30 17:03:23 Q1: When Oil prices are controlled by some oil companies then why we require a portfolio in the Govt. @dharmenrapradhan pradhan should resign
Q2 follows
4267 2018-05-30 17:03:17 Matlab how can they sanction us?? If they are so concerned ,they should give us oil for free
4268 2018-05-30 17:03:10 CBD oil and bacon grease on our dog's food seemed to help her look and act younger - she hasn't been incontinent though
4269 2018-05-30 17:03:01 No, rather it will help protect our shared marine/ freshwater ecosystems by taking oil off the rails and away from our inland waters. It will also increase the safety of Canadian tankers in an era where you are allowing more foreign-flagged tankers to supply the Puget refineries

4272 2018-05-30 17:02:42 With dharmic following armed forces in place I am sure armed forces would someday protect India from corrupt, fratricidal liberal seculars who are the slaves of Vatican and evangilical snake oil salesmen. Also from the religion of peaceful.
4273 2018-05-30 17:02:41 But, it will kill my oil position....
4274 2018-05-30 17:02:31 That sounds like mine, this might be a good shout! I tend to get dry areas in my T zone and oil everywhere else?? My skin is backwards haha
4275 2018-05-30 17:02:29 i don’t think i’ve ever had a problem that coconut oil couldn’t fix
4276 2018-05-30 17:02:25 That's why we're constantly finding new oil fields. And if you do research you would realize oil reserves that have been tapped completely have refilled over time..They don't want you to know any of this. Just like they don't want you to know there's a carburetor that does 180mtg
4277 2018-05-30 17:02:18 I bleach my hair and use argon oil and my hair is really soft
4278 2018-05-30 17:02:16 you might not want to use Sk as an example.  They had high commodity prices with high oil prices that led the growth.  Under the NDP last 5 years more jobs were created than Brad Walls first 5 years and that was with record oil prices.
4279 2018-05-30 17:02:16 WooHoo!  Snake Oil sales though the roof!
4280 2018-05-30 17:02:11 @SpaMagik hey! I have just found out that you use palm oil in your soap. I’m so disappointed. I’ve been buying your soap for a while without knowing it and I won’t buy it anymore from now. You need to change your ingredients!!
4281 2018-05-30 17:02:05 You get to be like that because of oil wealth and a small population, like Norway. America is too populated for all the reasources it has to be that utopian
4282 2018-05-30 17:01:55 The only thing that was saving Modi so far was crude oil. Now the crude is rising and common man is bearing the brunt...

And of course thank you to everyone that took photos and their time today.
4284 2018-05-30 17:01:46 For Mr. Diokno the situation is still OK based on his barometer, the US$135/barrel oil price ha ha ha.

Ang ngrereklamo daw ay ang mga hindi naman nagbabayad ng tax. My question is what about the VAT you introduced? Exmpted ba sa VAT goods na binibili ng mahihirap? Di ba tax yun?

4304 2018-05-30 17:00:08 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

4310 2018-05-30 16:59:56 What a principled defense of the poor, oppressed oil industry.

4316 2018-05-30 16:59:14 @narendramodi you cannot bring down the oil prices most regretfully I must ask you to put in your papers as the people of India are in pain!
4317 2018-05-30 16:59:13 God told me he’s a snake oil salesman.
4318 2018-05-30 16:59:13 I guess the only reason is that oil has started to trouble everyone now.
4319 2018-05-30 16:59:05 Because we get the pipeline built and we have an asset with value.  The government gets more royalties from the oil and gets paid to ship it.  They could sell a piece of it to the public in an IPO and raise 3 times what it would cost to buy and build.
4320 2018-05-30 16:59:02 ...and FYI the "tar sands" were called the "tar sands" from the time they were discovered to about 30yrs ago when the energy industry decided a little lipstick on their pig might improve its image, ergo: "oil sands"

4336 2018-05-30 16:57:45 “if Canada lets oil production expand as expected, global emissions could increase by 50 to 150 million tons CO2 by 2030 – the equivalent of putting as many as 32 million cars on the road each year.” #StockholmEnvironmentInstitute #climatechange #cdnpoli
4337 2018-05-30 16:57:41 True - but also perhaps unfair. Oil for example is v valuable!

4344 2018-05-30 16:56:55 In case the Oil Companies want to revise the prices of petroleum products on daily basis like the Jewellers do for Gold, then they should fall under the purview of the GST. You cannot indulge in an open loot @Swamy39 @PetroleumMin @EconomicTimes
4345 2018-05-30 16:56:54 I only had 3 hires, all awesome and H.O. said I had to chop one when the price of oil dropped. I delayed that shit until I could find a job for one of them. Worked out great for Jimbo.. Firing peeps is the toughest thing...

4357 2018-05-30 16:55:39 Would one day want to see you do something about the oil industry. Where oil is cheapest in the world market but doesn't translate to our local market.

Autistic kids, kids with seizures in foster care, are not able to access medication that works, because the FDA won't approve Cannabidiol for minors & the state can't do experimental.

It's God awful, they give other meds...
4365 2018-05-30 16:54:59 I think Japan is a lot further ahead of #Saudi chère! Regardless of the ridiculous amount of petro dollars #SaudiArabia has, they are consumers; not producers. At the very least #Japan makes cars and electronics. What does Saudi make apart from oil?
4366 2018-05-30 16:54:46 Yes! It hella does! It’s super dry in Colorado too so instead of using the shampoos that dry out my hair (like head and shoulders) I found that coconut oil helps eliminate that. But probably the most important part is braiding your hair almost every night

4371 2018-05-30 16:54:16 I think lots of governments would switch it renewable if it were economically feasible. I think the problem right now is that the world is still heavily relied on Oil, the transition has to be made, but in my opinion has to be made slowly, unfortunately.

4376 2018-05-30 16:53:58 I'm no economist, but devaluation has never worked for an economy that imports 95% of what it consumes. What were we exporting? Oil, which we buy back refined. Devaluation would have just been cosmetic, especially when we were exporting zilt.
4377 2018-05-30 16:53:56 "US will blockade China".

If that happens, a significant amount of global oil demand goes - now since oil is fungible, the Saudis & co will scramble to sell other nations like India (Nigeria's major crude export market).

Oil prices will drop & Nigeria will be screwed.

4384 2018-05-30 16:53:23 Thanks Andrea. We'll save the butter for the scones and get a spot of oil on it! ~Al
4385 2018-05-30 16:53:22 #FACTS! And Heroin, oops I mean Opiods & addiction brings in way more $ to everyone, govt, big pharma & the legal system! CBD oil just can't compete with that!
4386 2018-05-30 16:53:19 Lrt. You dip the freshly sliced onions inside hot oil before using it for the sandwich. Then put enough peanut butter and use chocolate filling if you want it to be extra sweet. It's such a litty combination
4387 2018-05-30 16:53:12 OK. So you could do with looking at @Draxnews electricinsights and follow @NGControlRoom. We use next to no coal and zero oil. Have a look at where our power really comes from :)
4388 2018-05-30 16:53:12 they can only dream of handing out billions of taxpayer dollars to their rich oil oligarch buddies with impunity. trudeau’s trump impersonation is spot on, if anything he out-trumped trump himself
4389 2018-05-30 16:53:03 Can you explain if the Federal Liberals removed our income tax credit for transit taking away incentive to commute, you implement a cap and trade tax that has gas prices at record highs when oil prices are fairly low. #Askkathleen #careovercuts
4390 2018-05-30 16:53:03 I would pay so much money for an airport gym membership.
Also, I think airport parking garages should offer oil changes and other annoying basic car maintenance stuff. I'm already leaving my car. Let me pay you $75 to do the things I want to avoid doing on the weekend!

4393 2018-05-30 16:52:56 So tankers initially...then when you say pipe working again, was the pipe used in the past for something.
4394 2018-05-30 16:52:50 "I'm...not easy to keep sedated..." He sighed, he really did look like he should nod off again he tried to sit up.

The nurse returned with a full water cooler tank and the motor oil he requested. She looked at Yusei. "Oh... I forgot to start the regular dosing..."
4395 2018-05-30 16:52:50 Damn wth. But yeah, just regular coconut oil & put some sunblock before tho so you don’t get burnt.
4396 2018-05-30 16:52:39 Toss up Linda Carter or Lindsey Wagner
4397 2018-05-30 16:52:35 Exactly. The Muppets being a Leftist propaganda machine is nonsense. Fox wanted there to be as many scandals under Obama as there were under Dubya. There weren't, so their machine went into overdrive. The idea of oil tycoons being bad guys is almost as old as movies themselves.
4398 2018-05-30 16:52:26 arsalan rubbing you down with oil and sliding 2 fingers up your bootyhole while he says “That’s it, cub...” into your ear with his deep manly voice
4399 2018-05-30 16:52:24 Beans coming off the lows nicely.

Green close seems optimistic - but this flush frees up some new longs to come back - esp if oil starts back up
4400 2018-05-30 16:52:23 LMAOO good ole times, my dude made me get up on skype to remind him to take his fish oil pills

well this morning I poured olive oil not into the pan I cook my turkey bacon in, but into the blender I make my smoothies in
4406 2018-05-30 16:51:33 Thx for the follow up. Can you explain why Aframax tankers are too small? They are used to transfer oil in many parts of the world. Including Venezuela Heavy oil. Isn't it good if the fleet has 20% capacity for preferable contracting?

4412 2018-05-30 16:51:02 ok i got it off. so it turns out spray paint beats water AND beats dish soap, BUT!!! oil beats spray paint. but oil also beats water. however, dish soap beats oil, and water beats dish soap. it’s a MULTI STEP PROCESS
4413 2018-05-30 16:51:02 I just read where Jesse Duplantis said he needs 54 Million dollars for another private jet for his ministry, all I need is 54 dollars for an Oil change and new windshield wipers.... 
4414 2018-05-30 16:50:57 The NDP has initiated policies that have already dramatically reduced the amount of GHGs emitted per barrel of oil. Under the NDP, we’ll continue to reduce emissions from the oil and gas sector even as the world starts the long, bumpy process of moving away from fossil fuels.

4417 2018-05-30 16:50:33 Yes trillions in debt because of our war and trade over oil. Overthrowing governments to put in a pro US dollar regime. Research the Petro dollar. Educate yourself. Read some books. If you think we’re going to war, which btw all of our current wars are illegal, over democracy, HA
4418 2018-05-30 16:50:31 AND NO ONE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE SEAT, IM ABOUTTA INVADE THIS SEAT THE WAY AMERICA DOES TO PLACES WITH OIL

4420 2018-05-30 16:50:13 It's not defending. Only highlighting hypocrisy. Oil is always highly taxed commodity and needs regulation.
4421 2018-05-30 16:50:07 It will take longer than a few weeks to get that pipe working again. Tankers will be pouring out of the #Horsehill gates again sooner than some folk would have us believe no doubt! Just like 2016.
4422 2018-05-30 16:50:04 Painfully it'll take ages cos even the crude oil world powers contribute to our woes....
4423 2018-05-30 16:50:04 Keep your dilbit and your gasoline Alberta.  Notley is a vindictive,foot stamping, bully.  Neither she or Trudeau can come up with a clean up plan or money for dilbit.  We can buy oil and gasoline from the USA.  Do not forget that Vancouver is a port for things other than dilbit.
4424 2018-05-30 16:50:04 Perhaps our party digging it's own graves by hiking oil price everyday and reducing one paise what a jock. People may not forgive the govt. Do you how many supports party loosing everyday ? Incapable people are in important position in the govt.
4425 2018-05-30 16:49:57 Cruz is getting PAC money. Beto is doing it the old-fashioned, roll up your sleeves way. Grassroots fundraising. I bet Cruz can’t smoke a brisket either. I’m voting Texas born & bred. Snake oil peddler Tedo isn’t.
4426 2018-05-30 16:49:46 When Republicans passed the TrumpTax, they gave 40% tax break to Big Oil companies. Instead of passing those savings on to consumers, major oil companies have announced record stock buybacks & billions in profits, thanks to rising fuel costs & Trump tariffs that help Russian oil.
4427 2018-05-30 16:49:45 yes, one day we might see a profit. until then we pray. pray it doesn’t have huge cost overruns. pray it doesn’t leak. pray the global price of oil keeps tarsands feasible in the resource market. pray that we aren’t on the hook for billions and billions in cleanup costs & losses
4428 2018-05-30 16:49:42 Holding half my #oil short absolutely!!.. took 6 bucks on the gain for half and have ZERO problem holding the rest
4429 2018-05-30 16:49:34 Soaring onion prices once brought down a popular govt.,I hope oil prices do not provide succour to the opposition this time.Central Govt.should intervene immediately.
4430 2018-05-30 16:49:28 Certainly!! Except for liberal psychopaths and evangilical Christian snake oil salesmen/ con artists.
4431 2018-05-30 16:49:19 I alternate oils in my hair to help grow. I put coconut oil for moisturizing my hair and keeping it shiny. Then, I’ll let my hair breath for a day. Next, I put castor oil in my hair (experimenting wblack castor oil rn). Tip: always have your hair braided. Leave oils in for 3 days
4432 2018-05-30 16:49:15 I'd say yes, or at least on par with olive oil or coconut oil. Definitely better than butter or vegetable oils (or other industrialized oils)
4433 2018-05-30 16:49:14 bruh im gettin that supreme oil

4443 2018-05-30 16:48:45 in this case the investment by Kinder Morgan was there. The federal gov. through regulation forced that investment away before realizing the Canadian economy NEEDED this pipeline. Not a typical bailout because industry is struggling. Oil investment is strong, just not in Canada.

4453 2018-05-30 16:48:15 @realDonaldTrump Ppl have cancer & havent been declared “will die soon” so WHY NOT allow any1 who has cancer try experimental meds like “CBD” oil.  Once a person is declared “willDieSoon” nothing will help; but let them take it early stages & IT Will Help!

4455 2018-05-30 16:48:06 But what, specifically, will you do to protect all Coloradans from air and water pollution caused by oil & gas fracking?  It's really an issue that calls for immediate action.

4492 2018-05-30 16:45:19 AB has the most robust middle class in Canada. It’s robust because of our oil and gas wealth.

4502 2018-05-30 16:44:53 You might be using too many face masques which can dry out your skin which causes it to over produce oil to try to rehydrate leading to an oily face. Try not using a masque for a few days and just using a gentle face wash and moisturizer twice a day in mornings and evenings
4503 2018-05-30 16:44:46 so the liberals buy a pipeline with tax payers money......yet at the same time ban tankers that would have shipped the oil from that pipeline..... in what world does this make sense... oh yes ... in the liberal world !

4507 2018-05-30 16:44:33 As an average nation wide, gas is up 31 percent from last year. Regardless of where the oil comes from. So why aren’t the same people who blamed Obama placing blame on Trump?
4508 2018-05-30 16:44:29 It is really good if the govt increase the oil price. Then people will use public transport. Ahh that's great. Okay then what should i do with my tractor. Who will plough my land. Do i need to buy bulls and cart again..
4509 2018-05-30 16:44:15 Sumit ji govt doing good job.. Oil price me one paisa cut... Kashmir valley me peace... Kala dhan wapas aaya.... Eight crore jobs create hue... Corruption khatam huA... There is no more crime in country... Cong toh aisehi blame karti hai
4510 2018-05-30 16:44:07 So you want to charge me a carbon tax / then you go expand oil production which I don't think is a bad thing but your talking out both sides of your mouth.
4511 2018-05-30 16:43:59 If you could empty your coffers , Indians would never have to pay for Oil.
4512 2018-05-30 16:43:50 Stop only appreciating dark skin girls when they are drenched in body oil with curvy figures and are half naked.

4514 2018-05-30 16:43:46 can the number of tankers increase by only one more a day. The math does not add up.. 2 a day now, increase the amount of oil to triple, then say only one more tanker a day? I just so sense that the facts are being 'arranged'..
4515 2018-05-30 16:43:46 I think he said once that a mask made of olive oil and turmeric was the trick to the Kylo hair. I don’t remember where I read that but.. lol
4516 2018-05-30 16:43:43 Because Abbasi is the biggest beneficiary of oil and gas after Air Blue by MD PIA.
4517 2018-05-30 16:43:36 Alberta is tired of being the wallet for the rest of Canada,if the other provinces elect the leaders who create a financial mess to receive Equalization payments,why do we have to continually bail them out,Quebec is sitting on over 300 million barrels of oil, why not developed?
4518 2018-05-30 16:43:33 This clown probly has a bunch of personal investments he is trying to protect from loss. Follow the money people and you will see. Oh and oil is the past. We have better tech but that would require loss of capital and real change. Something that investors and the rich don't want.

4528 2018-05-30 16:42:48 I don't think we are the owner of the oil. We just collect "Owo ómó oni ilè." We only get paid for having it in our soil or land, or water or country by the main owner (British). They own us, they own the resources.
4529 2018-05-30 16:42:48 So, here’s a thought. Given that Iran does clandestine monthly deliveries of free oil to Syria, they should consider selling some to Israel after passing the Suez. It might seem crazy now, but give it 9 months or so and it’ll all make perfect sense. Nobody will have to know!

4531 2018-05-30 16:42:43 As Newsweek reports, few are more likely to reap the benefits of Trump’s sanctions against Iran so much as Russia in the realm of energy and oil. This is why we can thank Trump for our rapidly rising gas prices
4532 2018-05-30 16:42:43 Due to Alberto, the storm dredged up blobs of oil, from the ocean, to the beaches of south Florida. They say it was from previous oil spills.

4546 2018-05-30 16:41:29 Oil prices are fixed by companies not by GOI. If opposition is concerned about people, let their states agree to include oil prices under GST.

When crude oil price was low around the world, BJP govt kept hiking petrol & diesel prices, earned Rs. 4.5 lakh crores per  year since 2014, but didn't pass on the benefits to common man.

Place in lightly salted water stock pot
Heat until veggies begin to bob then float.
"Al dente" is usually a light bobbing.
Toss with a light puree of olive oil, fresh onion/garlic and add fresh thyme, salt/pepper
Can then be sauteed or broiled with Parm.

Given we are "close" to finding oil I see a role for Petrojam to process this crude,
4564 2018-05-30 16:40:21 Just another form of redistribution of wealth. They are not gaining the funds from oil like Alaskan residents receive. If they can’t solve a problem they throw money at it. No manager or executive could survive a week in the private sector like this.

4580 2018-05-30 16:39:42 Yes - Trudeau’s comment that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there” begs for justification.  Maybe a country that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens over the myopia of oil tycoons would in fact leave it.
4581 2018-05-30 16:39:42 Who?
4582 2018-05-30 16:39:41 Remains of your parents coffee grinds, coconut oil and a bit of olive oil. Very, VERY gently scrub your face and body with it and let it sit for 5min. 
Rinse and before bed apply coconut oil on skin to moisturize 
4583 2018-05-30 16:39:40 It has far less certainty given a federal government unwilling to enforce the rule of law now owns it.  You just got ‘conned’ by Trudeau as the one card (blocking oil flow) has been ripped out of your hands.  #fooled

How many barrels of oil has been added to what was already being produced?
4595 2018-05-30 16:38:47 You forgot to mention that OPEC IS A MONOPOLY, formed to maximize the profits of oil producing countries by manipulating the production and availability of oil & creating artificial periods of scarcity or glut.  They cause untold suffering in countries hit hard by energy prices

4597 2018-05-30 16:38:41 I remember the Exxon Valdez. An oil spill is no joke, but it's not guaranteed going to happen in the timeframe between now and when there's no longer a market for oil which is coming. We don't have crystal.

4621 2018-05-30 16:37:10 Yet we are not sending them oil with our existing pipeline. Maybe they don't want our bitumen and its too expensive to ship it all the way to China. They have better, cheaper and closer suppliers.
4622 2018-05-30 16:37:05 Blanch them by soaking in boiling water for a couple minutes to turn deep green.  Remove to ice water bath to stop cooking process. When ready to use: Sauté minced garlic with olive oil over medium high heat, add beans, fresh tarragon, finish with white whine and cook until
4623 2018-05-30 16:37:03 Not a huge fan of lard: the fatty acid composition reflects what the pigs are fed, and it can have far too much omega-6. Same problem as olive oil: too much variation.
4624 2018-05-30 16:37:03 Because of that achievement the prices of oil & gas were very much low since 5 years . In the last days of PM Abbasi , specialy petrol was too cheap !!

I don't agree with Ye ek paisa kam karna. If the entire planet is reeling under high oil we will too. No escape.

4638 2018-05-30 16:35:47 said they felt that PM Trudeau is pro  big oil companies. And that was on wknd, BEFORE  the KM buyout. Cannot imagine what they would be saying now..
4639 2018-05-30 16:35:47 Got distracted when he said “endrakin” @1:15 and had to stop- he doesn’t even know what kind of snake oil he’s hucking!
4640 2018-05-30 16:35:46 So true, their tactics are becoming obvious now, clutching at straws
4641 2018-05-30 16:35:43 As if that's because of Obama. You know damn well the U.S. war on the Middle East is all about controlling their Natural resources. We're perfectly capable of harnessing other means of energy such as solar but we want their oil & have been waging war over there since the 80s.
4642 2018-05-30 16:35:40 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
4643 2018-05-30 16:35:40 Doesn't taste like it did in the function - I think I need to substantially reduce the oil, Rama said
4644 2018-05-30 16:35:33 Nigeria was in recession in 1982. Oil boom of the 70s had crashed and Nigeria was in deep fiscal crisis; Buhari took over the following year at the peak of the economic crisis.
4645 2018-05-30 16:35:33 Give the youth a chance. They never had access to oil money nor had fantastic salaries with everything paid for. Most a producing something out of determination , ideas and innovation. Need is the propeller of inventions. Oldies can advise and mentor. Thanks
4646 2018-05-30 16:35:24 La brea hay que comprarla ya antes de que suba el oil de nuevo
4647 2018-05-30 16:35:18 Another way is that you form a cartel box oil importing countries. People have done it with other commodities like copper concentrates. India & China can do that. Just ranting will not help. Give some solutions

4651 2018-05-30 16:34:47 From what I've seen, issues are deeper than just wanting to get out of the house.
4652 2018-05-30 16:34:45 And as time passed the USA moved closer to their own energy self-sufficiency. Why should we be held hostage to to one market? We will become greener & cleaner, but stopping Cdn oil now will not stop it from being used worldwide.
4653 2018-05-30 16:34:44 you don't get high with vapes lol XD unless you have Cannabis oil :P
4654 2018-05-30 16:34:40 Only when it comes to pasta, pizza and olive oil I guess.
4655 2018-05-30 16:34:22 Unfortunately the Day job rota prevents- can host on my oil rig... @DrOatibix can drone attendees to the venue! 
4656 2018-05-30 16:34:10 Why not spend the money on a NEW refinery or 2 located right here in Canada?! I've never understood why we send OUR oil South to be refined. And pay such hefty prices for Gasoline when it comes back!!!! 
4657 2018-05-30 16:33:59 I now understand why some people equate the NDC to be evil. What are you guys expecting us to use the oil money  for? Govetnance is about choices so u guys can burn the SEA.

4665 2018-05-30 16:33:16 Today i woke up at 8, went to get an oil change, got a coffee, then went to the bookstore.. who am i
4666 2018-05-30 16:33:13 Not sure i would disagree with that statement, but do we want to nationalize oil and gas transportation ? Not a good idea

4678 2018-05-30 16:32:00 @narendramodi_in, @PMOIndia : sir oil co. hv made a monkey of masses by reducing fuel price by one paisa after increasing it for 3 wks. Instead they cud hv waited for some more time. It is a cruel joke on the people who are already suffering. Doubt d competence of the officers.

4689 2018-05-30 16:30:47 This @narendramodi govt is taking too simplistic view of the Petroleum prices and hasn't been able to come up with more practical and innovative ways. Why didn't it form an oil price regulation when prices were quite low. We are not expecting inflation due to rising furl prices

4714 2018-05-30 16:28:41 I guess it depends on your perspective on oil demand. If oil is going to stick around for a while, then adding EOR to it is good for climate and gets CCS to scale and more ready for a zero CO2 future.

4742 2018-05-30 16:26:48 @steveliesman Yes, rising oil prices can be good for the economy, just as long as it doesn't go too far.  Look at the last few months.  Falling oil gives us a few pennies at the pump but kills a whole sector of the economy.  No hater here.
4743 2018-05-30 16:26:46 Stocks rebounding after yesterday's huge drop (DOW currently sitting at +296).  MBS has dropped 25bps and Yields have risen up to 2.85%.  OPEC decided to remain status quo and not release more oil to compensate Venezuela and Iran, so prices rise.

4750 2018-05-30 16:25:51 They also don't have the money we spend on frivolous wars for oil that we waste either. 
Most of the money raised in taxes in this country goes towards killing people in other countries.

4758 2018-05-30 16:25:18 Success? Yeah, it tends to have a weedy/herbaceous taste. Flavorings cover it somewhat: a good case for getting a stronger product so you don't have to taste it as long. When I buy the powder ("distillate") and dissolve it in oil, there is ZERO taste. Hope it does what you want.

4763 2018-05-30 16:25:06 Cool Christine! Easy to do? My hubby makes "insect repellant" by using essential oils (likes lavender oil as base & adds either eucalyptus or lemon) to keep mosquitos off him & the dog. Me? I use nicotine - pretty effective. Ha!
4764 2018-05-30 16:25:01 Truffle oil is a considerable amount cheaper than actual truffles. I just like buying gourmet foods im broke as cyunt lmao
4765 2018-05-30 16:24:59 My mom and mother in law both have epilepsy one uses medication and one uses CBD oil to help control. Take a look at all your options before going straight to medication. It takes a toll on your body.
4766 2018-05-30 16:24:55 Tge risk now is that the US puppets will prevent the presidential election to happen this year. They’ve already jailed Lula, the strongest candidate from the workers’ party. The US plan is clear: they want the control of Brazilian rich oil reserves in the Pre-Sal
4767 2018-05-30 16:24:55 Me : Should launch all India rasta roko against Saudi Arabia for raising crude prices in cahoots with Russia. Friend : No no..@narendramodi has to be blamed. Me : Yes. Modi should have acquired Saudi oil fields instead of making roads. Friend leaves... 
4768 2018-05-30 16:24:44 Lunch today... and for the rest of the week!! spinach, sunflower seeds, cranberries, avocado with olive oil and lemon juice dressing. Needless to say, I’m not excited.
4769 2018-05-30 16:24:43 How much is that coffee color
4770 2018-05-30 16:24:36 I love shopping at Target for Carapelli® Extra Virgin Olive Oil at a great price! It's a must have for my cooking needs! #CarapelliParty #Sponsored
4771 2018-05-30 16:24:35 Yh like water is free. Water is more scare resource than oil on planet. Instead we need to shift to electric vehicles.
4772 2018-05-30 16:24:30 PM Trudeau made the right decision on the pipeline as far as I’m concerned. I understand that leaders have to make difficult choices. I’m actually kind of shocked that we weren’t trading oil via the Pacific. This opens things right up for the oil patch. #TransMountainPipeline
4773 2018-05-30 16:24:27 truffle oil is the new latte
4774 2018-05-30 16:24:17 What was the price of crude oil at that time ?  Are u so ignorant to tweet ??
4775 2018-05-30 16:24:13 The anointing draws increase 
Bill Winston
Start the oil to flowing
The Anointing will protect you, provide for you, will take you where you never thought you would go.
Get use to using the Anointing. Get consciousness of the Anointing.
Glory to God!
4776 2018-05-30 16:24:11 PM doesn't cut the price Oil Company does...CommonSense
4777 2018-05-30 16:24:01 It is only noise in the news channels there is only about rs 4 increase in oil prices compare to 2013 priced. Peole are not worried that reflects in increase in consumption of petrol and increase in purchase of vehicles due to increade in income. Next tweets will give details.

4779 2018-05-30 16:23:53 In the summer I hear replacing your oil w water will help cool it down
4780 2018-05-30 16:23:48 Who is this fool on @CP24 saying that this pipeline HAS to be built? Oh… Peter MacKay from the PC party… of course… Going on and on about INCREASING oil exports… yeah, we need to destroy the planet some more…
4781 2018-05-30 16:23:43 @sardesairajdeep What kind of answer minister gave?These people made high fuel price a big issue in 2013-14 but they didn't pass the benefits when crude oil price was very low. Even now crude oil price is much lower than 2013-14.They only make fake promises & fool common people.
4782 2018-05-30 16:23:41 …to @steveliesman 's point…when I contracted for oil companies, when the price of crude was high they spent money hand over fist on R&D and "pie in the sky projects" rather than pay taxes…does have an up side…
4783 2018-05-30 16:23:36 Finally getting my oil changed .
4784 2018-05-30 16:23:33 Totally agree! I was enamoured with him since I was about five or six while he was on Fresh Prince.  Never missed an episode.
4785 2018-05-30 16:23:23 Where is BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra who is   an independent director on the board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC) Ltd . .
4786 2018-05-30 16:23:22 So... just a reminder to self-taught artists, or anyone really, just take a moment to read some tech info on how your materials behave.

 An example I've come across online is artists putting acrylic paint *over* oil. You really don't want to do that*.

*w/some rare exceptions
4787 2018-05-30 16:23:19 God, I hope not. That seems terrible for your oil efficiency. 
4788 2018-05-30 16:23:09 Saudi is still a police state, governed by radical fascist leaders & policies 

They are not our ally or friend, they funded, & were the masterminds behind 9/11

We don't need their oil, or fake alliance
4789 2018-05-30 16:23:09 No we don't feel insulted with #EkPaisaCut as we know good news round the corner. At least something is brewing with the oil companies.

4793 2018-05-30 16:22:55 There will always be demand for oil.  Electric cars may put a dent in it...but they won't eliminate it.
4794 2018-05-30 16:22:51 Reduction of 1 paisa in oil price is a mockery of the electorates
4795 2018-05-30 16:22:37 I was thinking about you yesterday actually,come and send this week I have oil and exfoliate for you!
4796 2018-05-30 16:22:29 I do this a little different and if you want to relax more, take a hot bath and put an ice pack on your neck. You can add lavender essential oil for a headache and I think peppermint oil for a migraine.
4797 2018-05-30 16:22:26 putting coconut oil in my hair and sitting on my deck in the sun topless is self-care
4798 2018-05-30 16:22:14 So the citizens are left to the mercy of oil companies!
4799 2018-05-30 16:22:10 They hide behind saying oil companies are loss and make their corporates happy
4800 2018-05-30 16:22:09 Cleary you aren't interested in the facts about Kinder Morgan. If you were, you would be just as upset as we are. Kinder Morgan pipeline is obsolete. It can't compete with the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port which has a much bigger facility that can accommodate much bigger ships!
4801 2018-05-30 16:22:04 Coconut oil wont fade the bleach and its amazing for your hair!
4802 2018-05-30 16:22:03 "It's one of the most remote areas you can imagine in western North Dakota near the Canadian border. It wasn't until the last decade that advances in fracking and drilling led to an oil rush. It became this hub of America for a while." @Mrao_Strib on the #Bakken
4803 2018-05-30 16:22:02 @AgustinDjDedos  she's here this wknd...I NEED TO GO and meet her!!!! will also be at the Brea Improv in July.
4804 2018-05-30 16:22:01 Sir the country's top joke today is 1 paise reduction in oil price. Pl address that. All these are srcondary.
4805 2018-05-30 16:22:01 With Trump threatening NAFTA, Canada needs to expand its oil markets. This deal gives a guaranteed price for the pipeline and will likely be sold later. Not building it does not decrease the amount of oil used globally.
4806 2018-05-30 16:21:59 Plenty of kids don’t know how to light an oil lamp either.
4807 2018-05-30 16:21:57 
4808 2018-05-30 16:21:57 @sjmuir ‘s response to that would be “blah blah blah”! The ONLY reason the pro oil lobbyists have for supporting this is money. There’s no other reason...and all this lobbying is meant to distract from what is planned for Metro Vancouver, not add to their ONLY reason...money!
4809 2018-05-30 16:21:56 my mother, vigorously rubbing oil into my chest: u know your rash is in a big T-shape 
me, suppressing a cough: oh haha that’s funny
4810 2018-05-30 16:21:50 Is it not insult to public? Whoever calculated and proposed this 1paise reduction should be a genius. Give him 1paise increase in salary. Also give same to all Oil company's officers.
4811 2018-05-30 16:21:50 Snip ends, little water, little coconut oil, salt, pepper. Put in a frying pan that you have a cover for, medium heat covered for about 10 mins or so.
4812 2018-05-30 16:21:42 what if it`s decided that petrol prices will be 100/- pl and it will not change for next 5 years,Fuck International Prices, In the next decade Chaos will choke Petrodollar and all Oil Rich Country,the most important commodity changes face value because of some trump and kim.
4813 2018-05-30 16:21:39 #EkPaiseKiSarkar has any govt. Or the so called de regulated oil companies ever increased the price  by 1 paisa??? Never. This is a joke on the so called Mango people of a banana republic.

4817 2018-05-30 16:21:26 I had no idea upending big oil would have setbacks. I'm sure it's very easy.
4818 2018-05-30 16:21:23 ทุกชีวิตต่างดิ้นรนเอาตัวรอดทั้งนั้นแหละ !!
4819 2018-05-30 16:21:14 #EkPaisaJoke why there is oil ministry when Govt has no control over OMC . The ministry should be dismantled
4820 2018-05-30 16:21:12 When oil was at $30 the Govt did not pass the benefit and when it is rising they want to peg it to market. Daylight robbery and we don’t know where the windfall netted (when oil was low) was utilised
4821 2018-05-30 16:21:10 As a Canadian taxpayer and now part owner of KMorgan pipeline, I am holding @JustinTrudeau and @RachelNotley personally responsible for any oil spill and damages done to our environment.
4822 2018-05-30 16:20:59 Ah,so "preach Mr.Premier" wasn't a sarcastic remark on your part - sorry Lesli, my mistake. I too support the Premier ( but I am yelling at Kinder Morgan & oil companies)
4823 2018-05-30 16:20:57 There was a parliamentary coup in Brazil in 2016 to topple a left wing president and now there’s a government in power selling off to foreign oil  giants the Brazilian state owned oil refineries and reserves. There’s an ongoing coup and attempt to de stabilise Brazilian democracy
4824 2018-05-30 16:20:48 二人とも、ただただ変態なんだと思うの。
4825 2018-05-30 16:20:28 Yes that would be a better investment for oil security and long term jobs.
4826 2018-05-30 16:20:25 Nobody "gets" you donnie, they've either been suckered or they can see right through your bs. There is nothing to "get", you are a snake oil salesman of ill regard. Where is all the greatness, big talker? All those feats of strength scheduled for the first 100 days? Huh?
4827 2018-05-30 16:20:25 @navikakumar best question to oil & gas minser...
4828 2018-05-30 16:20:21 Instead of Gaurav Bhatia one should call BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra appointment as an independent director on the board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation(ONGC) Ltd for this debate .
4829 2018-05-30 16:20:20 you forced our entire country to pay for your lousy project just to get votes in your province. as awful as kenney is, you're no better. both of you shilling for the oil and gas industry in a race to the bottom. well guess what? you won
4830 2018-05-30 16:20:19 What kind of answer BJP people are giving? It was these people made high fuel price a big issue in 2013-14 but they didn't pass the benefits when crude oil price was very low. Even now crude oil price is much lower than 2013-14.They only make fake promises & fool common people.
4831 2018-05-30 16:20:17 It's a big fucking deal for those who have served honorably, other than our veteran's benefits we get fucked all from our communities. A free hair cut, a meal and an oil change is nice once a year, but it's a pittance for all we did.
4832 2018-05-30 16:20:13 Accidental vote for knife and fork. I’m actually a, couple bites until it is in folding range guy. I try to not fold immediately because the tip lags and could leak oil on your shirt. So I remove it first with a couple bites and then I fold 
4833 2018-05-30 16:20:05 After I get my oil changed yes
4834 2018-05-30 16:20:04 Finally a positive news! Otherwise sold media is bashing Tesla due to pressure from giant oil industries.

4838 2018-05-30 16:19:56 If you think we aren’t going to war over oil and natural resources...
4839 2018-05-30 16:19:55 If you believe that high oil prices are good for the US economy, then you also believe that high tax rates are good for the US economy...

#TaxandSpend
4840 2018-05-30 16:19:52 But if the government is saying country is doing so well then why so much dependence on oil tax? I am sure if we are doing well plus they are increasing tax base revenues should automatically be higher. Unless of course they are lying about state of the economy.

4849 2018-05-30 16:19:20 Does anyone else get anxiety while getting an oil change? Any minute the garage guy is going to yell at me for auto abuse.

4858 2018-05-30 16:18:56 will timesnow or any other channel do objective reporting? Tell the public how it is wrong to reduce by 1 paisa and not more, with facts. Inform common man how did this happen and then debate. How govt or oil Cos are involved. Otherwise dont act as illiterate or cheap politician.
4859 2018-05-30 16:18:56 #EkPaisaCut Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, Agreed that you don’t control the oil prices , but you do control the huge TAX on top of the price ..Right?

4870 2018-05-30 16:18:20 Minister Pradhans replies to Navika totally unconvincing. If prices were linked to market at the discretion of oil companies, why did they offset it by raising excise duties at centre and VAT in states.
4871 2018-05-30 16:18:12 @PetroleumMin @dpradhanbjp @PMOIndia @narendramodi @arunjaitley @FinMinIndia sir we sincerely request you to reduce oil prices,I can transfer 1 paisa to your account if you want, being a hardcore BJP supporter,we are totally let down by your oil policies!!#Oil minister step down

4880 2018-05-30 16:17:34 To reduce. We may increase crude oil storage facilities to store additional crude oil when prices fall and thus get benefit of low crude prices. Keep lesser stock when prices rise. Buy more and store when prices fall. Thus we may reduce/average petrol and diesel price.

4894 2018-05-30 16:16:39 Oil companies r very sensitive to BJP err... Common People that is why befor Karnataka election for continous 19 days there was no fuel hike.
4895 2018-05-30 16:16:35 @republic @BJP4India  say spokesman's  don't offensive to others. Secondly foolish fellows are oil minister. BJP is happy when they suit questions now in the name of oil they are looting BJP will see the results. #KilledForBackingBJP
4896 2018-05-30 16:16:35 (1) In total, India's imports of Venezuelan oil in Jan-Apr fell 20.4% vs same period of 2017, to 314,500 barrels per day. They used to be 400,000-450,000 bpd when supply contracts were signed
4897 2018-05-30 16:16:25 In last four years,govt collected,saved additional amount of 30 lakh crore in 4 yrs by way of cutting subsidy,GST,coal,4G, oil  price,IT,etc

4900 2018-05-30 16:16:05  Plz also write the date and crude oil rate at that date .. We are not from Yale University .. 
4901 2018-05-30 16:15:56 @PMOIndia @PetroleumMin @CMOMaharashtra your govt royally fooled Indian people by reducing 1paise on fuel price. Your govt has lost all the credibility. Are you aiding Pvt oil companies?
4902 2018-05-30 16:15:40 I confirm that :
1- LNA has still not managed to secure Benghazi
2- There are always IS attacks
3- The threat still hangs over the oil terminals
4- The retaking of the beleaguered city of Derna is still waiting.
Haftar was a privileged partner, but this is not the case now.
4903 2018-05-30 16:15:35 It's true that we are importing 80 percent of our crude demand but the question is what are we doing to reduce our dependence on crude. And bigger question is does govt actually wants to reduce dependence given the handsome amount of revenue oil generates.

The dacoits of Riyad were made rulers with specific project of introducing Wahabism --- a hated version of Islam not only in this part but entire muslim nations

4920 2018-05-30 16:14:51 Should not reduce oil prices at all! The rich people should pay tax on petrol as they consume more than 90% of total consumption of petrol. @INCIndia provided subsidy on petrol for many years b4 prices were tagged to market prices.
4921 2018-05-30 16:14:44 No. Google it. I use the one with coconut oil.
4922 2018-05-30 16:14:43 We may increase crude oil storage facilities to store additional crude oil when prices fall and thus get benefit of low crude prices. Keep lesser stock when prices rise. Buy more and store when prices fall. Thus we may reduce petrol and diesel price.

4928 2018-05-30 16:14:09 It’s the oil companies that decide on price, tax structure by govt. must hv been easy to play this joke...

3) Oil

4942 2018-05-30 16:13:33 This oil isn't going to us. It's going to the port of Vancouver, then overseas, and then back to us for twice the price. Long term it probably creates more jobs in China than in Canada.

4952 2018-05-30 16:12:56 lol ya, they'd rather keep their revenue low from extremely depressed oil prices that are discounted due to a lack of pipelines. #BugetsBalanceThemselves
4953 2018-05-30 16:12:53 Also, the old what-about-that-other-thing argument is a logical fallacy. Oil is the worst. It doesn’t matter if other sources aren’t perfect. They don’t need to be perfect to be better than oil.

Put baking paper on cookie sheet. Spread coated beans on this, bake for 10 mins and check. Keep baking until slightly browned.

4959 2018-05-30 16:12:37 It can partially be attributed to the fact that India has started to build a buffer stock of oil. The first tankers for that arrived in Mangalore port a few weeks ago. Just a guess, though. #oilprices 
4960 2018-05-30 16:12:36 i dont think i ever mentioned this but i love love love the smell of tamanu oil. its so soothing and so relaxing, kind of I'm one with the earth smell
4961 2018-05-30 16:12:35 What's the use in arguing when you started with lies. We spent trillions on big energy subsidies.  You're not including the cost of keeping the oil shipping lanes clear, the CIA and DoD overhead to enforce the petrodollar, etc either...
4962 2018-05-30 16:12:33 I just wanna go home and oil my scalp
4963 2018-05-30 16:12:32 an hour trying to explain that I didn't mean for us to compromise, but to get them to come up with actual compromises. If they're (gungrabbers) are looking for meeting up in the middle, they need to concede some ground.
4964 2018-05-30 16:12:30 In 2016, The NDA Government passed the benefit of the lower global crude oil prices to the people of #India. Due credit shud be given to the Govt. @republic #EkpaisaCut
4965 2018-05-30 16:12:26 Gas prices? I bet you did not say a peep when they were higher with Obama. Plus, gas/oil prices rise as an economy strengthens. But that doesn’t matter, just #HateTrump!

Company stock buy backs? Those are good things! Those help investors! 

The one thing I agree on: tariffs
4966 2018-05-30 16:12:25 The reason?  Electric cars.  Oil companies att behind thevdestruction of the coal industry with these ngo’s. Making cars go is their busines

4980 2018-05-30 16:11:26 @TimesNow @suhelseth Sir very well said on the debate political fixing on oil prices happens every time and govt when introducing new CESS etc should explain in simple terms to the people with logic so they can see the long run benefit and yes let us not keep talk about history..
4981 2018-05-30 16:11:19 The government must consider a cost plus pricing model and not the trade parity pricing system to be able to insulate the consumer in the long term from the vagaries of free market oil.

4985 2018-05-30 16:10:45 In fact, in Alberta, there was much wailing and rending of garments when foreign oil companies left the oil sands in favour of two regional oil-sands specialists who bought their operations.
4986 2018-05-30 16:10:40 Not denying that Modi Govt inherited lower oil prices and could lower prices and didn't. But who would repay huge subsidy burden that was created by previous regime. Not blaming the previous govt. They did wut could be done best in the circumstances.

4993 2018-05-30 16:10:18 Not from you, I had mentioned in a thread about when gungrabbers say we should compromise, ask them what they're willing to compromise on (put the ball in their court, usually get "we'll let you keep this" as if that's a compromise) and spent the better part of 1/

5020 2018-05-30 16:08:43 There is no any cut in oil prise but a regular updation according to oil market whether it is higher or lower.
5021 2018-05-30 16:08:36 jaclyn hill said in one of her older videos that she doesnt use mineral oil when its one of the top ingredients in morphe palettes including her own #okayjax
5022 2018-05-30 16:08:21 #EkPaisaCut | The BJP inherited a lower oil price. It did not bring the price down: Suhel Seth-Managing Partner, Counselage
5023 2018-05-30 16:08:18 Oh and even more recently in a trap filled dungeon we came across a strange puddle. Fearing more traps I went to smell it to see if it was oil, it turned out to be an ooze which immediately latched onto my face and slowly suffocated me. We had no magic weapons so I died.
5024 2018-05-30 16:08:15 #petrolhike still @BJP4India  not implementing GST on crude Oil because Govt is Earning lots of revenue from this.

If petrol/diesal comes under GSt it will be boon for middle class families.
5025 2018-05-30 16:08:14 1 Paisa reduction in Petrol price. Did the oil companies increase the price by 1 paisa any time? Heights!!! #FuelHike
5026 2018-05-30 16:08:13 Are the funds to help there(in gov control) and deliberately not accessed or did the 1% & oil business ppl take them and lose them to foreign oil companies?

5028 2018-05-30 16:08:08 #EkPaisaJoke Interesting point oil companies made a profit of 3500 crores last year which is less than the amount spent on advertisements for self glorification. Forget the fuel cost on 40 plus trips around the world
5029 2018-05-30 16:08:06 oil reversal + Bovespa selloff / brazil strike
5030 2018-05-30 16:08:06 @narendramodi congrats mr. modi what message do you want to  give to this nation by decreasing 1 paise when there is no value for 5 rupees also 
if crude oil @80 dollars ,,pertol at 84 rupees ....super great gift to this nation
5031 2018-05-30 16:07:55 If public money had not been put into building for the future the Tran's Canada Pipeline, the Tran's Canada Railway, the east coast off shore oil and GCOS along with Syncrude would not have happened.  It was all the right choice like TMX
5032 2018-05-30 16:07:54 Trump is responsible for the tariffs, he appointed Pruitt who is catering to oil nd gas industries. Multiple lawsuits have been filed but Trump is keeping Pruitt. He's not going to save you.
5033 2018-05-30 16:07:50 Last part is ironic considering dnc rhetoric.
5034 2018-05-30 16:07:44 More oil than the exxon Valdez 
5035 2018-05-30 16:07:43 Where's the platform? And gas will only go to $2/litre if Trump goes to war with Iran or some other oil producer, not because of the NDP. And where's the plan to pay for your promises?
5036 2018-05-30 16:07:41 A new social media trend has men painting their beards bright colors and now a company is capitalizing on the trend with their Glitter Beard Kit—packed with beard oil, glitter and a bib to catch the glittery remnants. Adorning your beard for the sake of social media sparkle?
5037 2018-05-30 16:07:36 What did your thieving friends in @OfficialPDPNig do to improve it when oil sold at very high prices while they were in Gov't?
5038 2018-05-30 16:07:36 あり
5039 2018-05-30 16:07:34 <living bottle of olive oil
5040 2018-05-30 16:07:33 Then again a guy in our group asked an LSU couple why they were carrying so much oil and they looked at him like he was the dumbest SOB alive and asked "Y'all never deep fried a turkey?".  Haha good times.  Should have won the game.
5041 2018-05-30 16:07:30 Too many interventions, and i think a correlation chart between oil price matters and doesnt matters, (kinked curve) to RM is important. I dunno. Just a guess. Get ur analyst to do it.
5042 2018-05-30 16:07:28 No common man know the 1 Rs price cut.  It is opposition leaders doing their business since they have no issue to raise. We know that it is the fault of oil companies by mistake made the mistake.  We will accept the price rise even beyond Rs 100, for the shake of India.
5043 2018-05-30 16:07:22 We need to stop climate change by using less oil, coal and fossil fuels.
5044 2018-05-30 16:07:10 are you still short oil?  the DCB or ?, makes things look like 'we are back on our regularly scheduled program' - off to 70's +

5046 2018-05-30 16:07:08 @IndiaToday Oil minister says states should cut sales tax on petroleum products, but BJP ruled states have their own problems & cannot cut.
5047 2018-05-30 16:07:06 I mostly love to see your debate shows. You must highlight on going drama on petrol & diesel prices of central govt. This much of hikes in crude oils will impact the inflammation a lot. Can't crude oil be under gst. Mr pardhan making fool of the peoples by its fake statements.
5048 2018-05-30 16:06:55 Snake oil salesmen!

5051 2018-05-30 16:06:49 Went to a place for lunch. Offered me truffle fries.  I declined the motor oil...Looked at salmon in the store ummm no thank you.  What a eye opener.  Let’s do a part 2 please.

5055 2018-05-30 16:06:32 The Party which promised Acche Dhin during the 2014 elections is now taking the Comman Man for Granted. When Crude Oil Prices in the International Markets have started decreasing the Petroleum Companies have not reduced the prices. A one Paise reduction amounts to sheer Arrogance
5056 2018-05-30 16:06:18 Yesterday I wanted to sign a petition against Trudeau's move on oil and the response was:  We think this is spam because it is very much chaired on Facebook!  The second time it worked.

5059 2018-05-30 16:06:07 Institutional racism and discriminatory policies are not direct however they are always embedded under other laws. For instance google property law in regards to locating and distribution of crude oil in areas like Abeiya and Bahr Al gazal.

5067 2018-05-30 16:04:57 Amongst the many rights the NDA government has done their control or lack of it on oil prices is their biggest blunder.

Dont allow this perception to grow Govt can only control Fuel Prices if Crude Oil rates are in favor & dont allow Media to control public perceptions as Media is already agnst U
5072 2018-05-30 16:04:40 The motivation is off, but I must agree with the oil painting bit 
The elderly is also a bit strong, but I can live with that 
5073 2018-05-30 16:04:39 I think you mean well, just I see issues with the idea that it would do more harm than good (especially with regards to rights.)

Agreed, different strokes for different folks.
5074 2018-05-30 16:04:31 today is a very dangerous way lots of ppl are short oil i bouncing and NQ is lagging if NQ finds some stregth ES could rally to the end of the range for Fun (was only joking yest but I guess jokes on me )

5085 2018-05-30 16:03:32 please get your facts right before blaming Oil PSUs for inefficiency, #EkPaisaCut @republic @ArnabGswm
5086 2018-05-30 16:03:21 What then additional revenue from oil import cost , the > 7% GDP growth doing , additional Crs of direct tax payers.  - or all these too are Jhumlas.
5087 2018-05-30 16:03:20 There's huge pressure from US, India and EU nations on GCC countries to reduce oil prices. GCC meeting in Kuwait this Saturday to discuss hiking production to bring prices down. Prices should start stabilising starting June.
5088 2018-05-30 16:03:01 #EkPaiseCuti agree that in 2014 was 84 when oil was 117$ and now it's less than 50$. So argument doesn't hold good. By the way it's really disgusting to see the reduction of 1p. Better would have remained unchanged
5089 2018-05-30 16:02:55 @narendramodi #crudejoke on reducing oil price by just 1paise. #EkPaiseKiSarkar #EkPaisaCut y 1paise y not 1rs. We people have to face the brunt of taxes @FinMinIndia

5129 2018-05-30 16:00:49 @sardesairajdeep You have put the minister @dpradhanbjp rightly on the mat He has no answer for the question you put which is on every citizen’s mind He keeps harping on global issues which affect oil prices but no answer for the taxes increase from 2014 #FuelPrices
5130 2018-05-30 16:00:49 Good job. However, the perf of an oil mono-economy must be benchmarked against oil prices over the period as a takeoff point. Nothing moves until oil prices move. It will be interesting if you could represent your data with that contrast. Then informed insights can be gleaned.
5131 2018-05-30 16:00:42 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!

5151 2018-05-30 15:59:33 #EkPaiseKiSarkar whether it's the Congress or BJP, it is the middle class always at the receiving end. If they reduce the taxes on oil, who will fund the Bank NPA and farm loan waivers?? #PetrolPrice
5152 2018-05-30 15:59:28 That's rich coming from Americans. But solar and wind don't compete with gasoline & diesel directly. Canada has massive hydropower generation in the electricity sector, and the rest is gas and nuclear. For oil, the competiton will be EVs that can be powered by a mix of power.
5153 2018-05-30 15:59:26 is se ziyada oil to men omelette men us kerti hon...
5154 2018-05-30 15:59:21 It seems oil companies also conspiring to debacle Modi. Such strong is eco system of Maino
5155 2018-05-30 15:59:21 True though, I could see that changing if abortions weren't publically funded. If people had to face the consequences of their actions, they would be more inclined to execute some personal responsibility (... That statement, maybe a self fulfilling prophecy, but YKWIM.)
5156 2018-05-30 15:59:20 I have voted BJP not to reduce oil price but good governance for next 70 years. Short term problems are not a problem atall
5157 2018-05-30 15:59:10 If your idea of a good way to end the day is cleaning up puke, suntan oil/lotion and other body fluids.

5160 2018-05-30 15:58:42 #EkPaisaJoke
What is the price of oil prices at which Indian oil companies are procuring it ?
5161 2018-05-30 15:58:40 #EkPaisaCut don't increase gst rates, don't increase income tax instead reduce it, don't increase fuel rates of 85% dependent of oil import country, then how my nation will move forward without funds, then what's about yearly budget spending on welfare schemes.

5164 2018-05-30 15:58:30 BJP is expecting bumper hike in crude oil prices , very soon ! But , where is the money gone , earned through taxes . Are they storing the money to pay back 15 lacs to the family heads (except the suited-booyed , of course) before the big election ?

5171 2018-05-30 15:58:07 Remaining grape pulp? Save for breakfast & spread on rice cakes (make my own & my own salt free & oil free peanut butter) with fav hot tea. Or add to plain yogurt, stir, & use as spread for tuna lettuce wraps for lunch. Chill & serve with cucumber slices
5172 2018-05-30 15:58:06 @PMOIndia  While you were on foreign tour, Oil companies magnanimously reduced prices by ONE PAISA/ Ltr. No wonder people say " PAISE me paramatma hai"
Can Nation afford this kind of magnanimity?
5173 2018-05-30 15:58:06 You only snip the end that was attacked to the plant. You don't snip both ends. You can steam, boil or roast. Add whatever seasoning or fat (butter/oil).
Leave whole, cut, or julienne.
5174 2018-05-30 15:58:01 If you know anyone that uses essential oils, have them make you a spray bottle with peppermint oil in it! Works wonders.
5175 2018-05-30 15:57:57 Since I’m thinking up old films I’ve never seen again for decades. I remember one about like, a plantation or colony, drilling for oil or something. It had dinosaurs in the island, 2 big ones. I remember one scene where this arsehole destroyed a child toys of the dinosaur.
5176 2018-05-30 15:57:56 They go to the US west coast because there is a market for it and another 800000 barrels a day will allow oil to go to China as well because there is a market for it
5177 2018-05-30 15:57:47 Nakakahilo pala pag nasobrahan ka dun sa chili oil tangna HAHAHA sakit ng ulo ko 
5178 2018-05-30 15:57:43 I think the @mygovindia should do something to arrest the Oil Price Hike on a war footing basis. I think @gauravbh is defending the indefensible about Oil price Raise
#EkPaisaJoke is the biggest disaster.

5183 2018-05-30 15:57:29 Never add oil to the water. Never rinse pasta.
5184 2018-05-30 15:57:26 how much does this 1paise affect. What if the oil vos have not reduced 1paisa, you and your lot by way of investigative wd have found out and wont you raised a hue & cry. 'The nation wants to know viewers 1paisa and so many million litres, where did they go. Will the min answer?'
5185 2018-05-30 15:57:24 Bullish en oil
5186 2018-05-30 15:57:22 #EkPaisaCut a cruel joke by oil companies . @narendramodi please step in. The price does not seem to be linked with international, sice crude is falling but prices are not.

5189 2018-05-30 15:57:06 This increase is actually on Trump. By pulling out of the Iran deal he destabilised the oil price and now we're bearing the brunt of it
5190 2018-05-30 15:56:57 All want salary of 2018 but want oil at 2008 level.
5191 2018-05-30 15:56:55 An example for freddie gray the local population just rioted till they burned out like a oil fire and everybody forgot about it once the media moved on..but local media reported the Local city gov called off an internal investigation. And nobody said nothing.

5193 2018-05-30 15:56:54 Cut the ends off, put in pot on stove with water and salt and tons of bacon. Best ever. Or roast in the oven at 400 degrees until tender season to your liking and put olive oil on them first
5194 2018-05-30 15:56:47 The type of oil doesn’t matter and the home made ones portion is smaller
5195 2018-05-30 15:56:43 Isnt there something with stronger cans...maybe Foster's in those hefty oil cans?
5196 2018-05-30 15:56:43 Oil! People always need cooking oil but it’s rarely donated
5197 2018-05-30 15:56:39 Manic oil market meltdownCrude oil prices are still reeling from the threat that OPEC and Russia may raise output and fear that turmoil in Italy could cause larger problems in the Eurozone.

5198 2018-05-30 15:56:33 What really annoys me is uneducated rival fans spouting “oh look liverpool doing a chelsea/ city and trying to buy the league” 
No you cockwombles we are reinvesting the money from sales, not spending magic oil money.
5199 2018-05-30 15:56:25 coconut oil in my phone between appointments thing is rough.
5200 2018-05-30 15:56:16 Agreed there is some kind of conspiracy and its roots lie in Oil marketing companies which has too many congi loyalists #EkPaisaCut
5201 2018-05-30 15:56:14 You're good as long as she never talks. ;-)
5202 2018-05-30 15:56:12 Oil remains main source for energy and makes a lot of revenue for countries! It’s difficult to move away from oil when it is black gold! 
But it’s not sustainable! At least other countries are making efforts to focus on renewable energy! @JustinTrudeau is not making this effort!
5203 2018-05-30 15:56:11 Some guy tried to pull that crap on me a couple years ago. He was like, "this is gonna need synthetic oil, runs better and its a newer model." I was like chill, its not that new, its 2009, and i dont have 80 dollars for your special grease.
5204 2018-05-30 15:56:09 #EkPaiseKiSarkar Crude jokes with the people of country,It is just like EkpaisaKaJokes,embracing situation 4 d govt as well as oil companies, how can reduced 60 paise then claimed releas only 1 paisa. Perhaps no body ever heard one paisa increased or decreased of any item
5205 2018-05-30 15:56:08 You have interesting friends! In short, no. I can't imagine the amount of pressure you would need to push sand oil through a pipe. You could try researching the new pipeline Trudeau is buying. That's pushing bitumen through a pipe..

5217 2018-05-30 15:55:17 No tea, just facts. Glass skin is impossible to achieve naturally. The least you could try to do is put actual oil or vaseline on your face. Most are just very complicated make up steps to achieve a 'natural look'

5222 2018-05-30 15:55:05 #EkPaisaCut Why these oil companies are bringing shame for Govt by  reducing rate by 1 paisa, instead they should have adjusted this on next day. it is as simple as that.

5225 2018-05-30 15:54:49 Thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant grilling of the oil minister on the show! Very pertinent questions asked! Minister looked helpless
5226 2018-05-30 15:54:43 Well @sardesairajdeep says Thailand has oil fund... While referring to @PChidambaram_IN talk. Does he not know India had a Oil pool account... It had money... Chidambaram took that money and effectively closed the account 
5227 2018-05-30 15:54:42 This was my issue yesterday! I’m using this chunky holographic sequins glitter and I couldn’t get it off my skin forEVER  apparently masking tape and olive oil are the ways to go
5228 2018-05-30 15:54:32 thanks. you going to short oil or wait for the set-up to go long?
5229 2018-05-30 15:54:29 that is very true. When I make my dog's food she doesn't smell much at all. Chicken, rice, some veggies, olive oil.

5242 2018-05-30 15:53:41 We could have afforded it last time but just like then, why should we?  OPEC is pumping out oil to record highs so we know it is not due to supply. I think it's purely corporate greed.

5246 2018-05-30 15:53:32 Personally I would like to see a ban on ALL plastic not just single use, if you think about it plastic is single use, not repairable, high energy cost to recycle, & horrible litter. Also how much would we reduce oil use if we did not make plastic & encourage electric vehicles.
5247 2018-05-30 15:53:29 Water is moisture
Water first then followed by a good oil (olive coconut castor. I love grapeseed)
Then use a butter (whipped shea) or moisturizing creme/leave in condish

5254 2018-05-30 15:52:57 WW2 was won because America supplied 7 out of every 8 barrels used in the war. In stark contrast The Reich was so short of Oil that they had to disband most of their motorized columns for horse buggies. Thats a start.
5255 2018-05-30 15:52:53 Yes, and the oil embargo was called off very quickly too...
5256 2018-05-30 15:52:48 I wonder why govt or oil corporations fix petrol and diesel rates in paisa.If petrol rate is

5257 2018-05-30 15:52:43 oil companies must STOP this price ficing racket at 7843 etc to benefit their dealers in change-in crores -they must fix it as7850 etc/50 p gap only-They shld become slowly customer centric from being dealer centric:))) @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @PiyushGoyal @nitin_gadkari  RT

5261 2018-05-30 15:52:38 Can't argue that last point, but you have to wonder where would big oil be without the massive government subsidies they receive from all levels of gov't? What if those were instead provided to renewables? Add $4.5b and you have a new economic driver...

5268 2018-05-30 15:52:24 #EkPaisaJoke The government can control prices of medicines , supply third grade generic medicines and play with the health of people but cannot control the oil price . What a joke !

5270 2018-05-30 15:52:17 Oil Companies: We lowered the crude oil prices by 1 paise.

So maybe now you can afford that car you always wanted.

5288 2018-05-30 15:50:52 @republic @TimesNow GOI has nothing to do with one paise cut. It price mechanism linked with oil company. Media unnecessary becomes hyper to run 24×7 channel @gauravbhatiabjp @RatanSharda55 #EkPaisaCut
5289 2018-05-30 15:50:51 Our oil is largely destined for Asian markets. Some provinces, like the province of BC or British Columbia, get fossil fuels from the US. @BlanchardSL #yyc
5290 2018-05-30 15:50:45 Illogical answer, people selected you to cutdown that and not to give excuses . Compare the crude oil price also please
5291 2018-05-30 15:50:43 #EkPaisacut 
When international oil prize increase the price of oil goes up. Fine. But when it comes down the government can not say we will not decrease the prize because we are using the money for social obligations. BJP is digging its own grave.
5292 2018-05-30 15:50:37 Tamilisai bjp state president in TN is not responding when she is director of oil companies in India nominated by modi
5293 2018-05-30 15:50:37 This 1 paisa cut amounts to making mockery of common man. Why relate fuel price hike to welfare measures? Is’nt petrol/diesal used by common man? Why can’t BJP ruled states reduce VAT & govt. reduce excise duty? Why don’t govt bring fuel prices under GST? Oil cos can cut margin.
5294 2018-05-30 15:50:35 City seems to have a fan base of two halves: older fans who’ve supported the club since long before the oil money & the new generation of glory-supporting nonces who are currently obsessed with Liverpool after we ruined their perfect season. Unfair to tar all with the same brush
5295 2018-05-30 15:50:34 The Feds found enough money to buy a pipeline, the same money they can’t find to fix First Nations’ water crisis. Are we sure we can’t drink oil? Are we sure? The government can’t build water lines into First Nations but they sure as fuck can build pipelines into First Nations.

5297 2018-05-30 15:50:32 Ugh. So they’re telling us that AFTER THE OIL IS GONE...we are going to have to walk? What the F is the point of THAT statement. MAKE PEOPLE WALK NOW. SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT!! Dammit.

5300 2018-05-30 15:50:14 What subsidy?  What department send oil companies money or give them a targeted tax break as wind, solar have?
Serious question. 
Mike Pompeo had legislation ending all targeted energy tax credits. There was one for small oil wells. Everything else for "alternative" energy.
5301 2018-05-30 15:50:14 Makes sense.
5302 2018-05-30 15:50:11 @aajtak @ndtv @abpnewstv @ZeeNews @IndiaToday you all talk like economist on crude oil. Please show us your degrees as you verify others.
5303 2018-05-30 15:50:08 'What is coming across to the general common man is that oil is being used to profiteer rather than profit. And oil marketing companies are being equally irresponsible in manner they have started pricing fuel', says @suhelseth, Columnist #EkPaisaJoke
5304 2018-05-30 15:50:05 On March 21, 1951, the Trans Mountain Pipeline Company was created by a special Act of Parliament. On the same day, the company made a pipeline proposal to the Board of Transport Commissioners. Ownership of the company was split between Canadian Bechtel Ltd. and Standard Oil.

5307 2018-05-30 15:49:51 Some other reasons of high fuel prices are:
1) highly paid n over staffing in oil psu'swith low productivity, peon gets over lakh salary.
2) hefty taxes higher than Everest with no transparency. Crude oil was. @ 110 a barrel in UPA era but fuel was cheaper than now.

5314 2018-05-30 15:49:17 Peso wages have probably not kept up with the domestic price of oil products, and that’s the problem that many see.  We could wish for world crude to go down (possible, even likely) and the peso to go up (?)..
5315 2018-05-30 15:49:14 @chetan_bhagat @suhelseth whether its the Congress or BJP, the person at the receiving end is always the middle class. if the centre and states reduce tax on oil, who will fund the farm loan waivers?? #indianmiddleclass #oilprices

For the foreseeable, the world uses oil, so this offsets non-sequestering oil production. And truly long term, either saline injection or other sequestering use (brick, fertilizer, etc.)

Now whatever increase or decrease in international prices should be pass by oil companies to consumers.
5329 2018-05-30 15:48:28 "Trust us", the oil companies say. "Trust us", the Alberta and Federal governments say. But, you know, I've found that, when it comes to the Trans Mountain pipeline, you can't trust any of them.

5332 2018-05-30 15:48:09 It depends on the pipeline. TransMountain? I’m ok with that. The Kitimat one? No way!  Plus, the oil being sent by ship from Burnaby should have that additional polymer added to make it easy to clean up when there is a ‘spill’ (ie with that it stays in a floating chunk)

5347 2018-05-30 15:47:03 I know govt will suffer hugely by cutting excise duty on oil but you must do it otherwise it will be a big disappointment.

5359 2018-05-30 15:45:59 #ekpaisajoke The BJP Central Government may try to justify the spiralling fuel oil prices by their own costing method; but what they fail to recognize is the utter disappointment and anger of the common people and this could cost them heavily in terms of votes.
5360 2018-05-30 15:45:52 @navikakumar Frustrating-the Media do not understand the basic things.Not any price cut declared by Govt, Prices gets revised daily,as per current practice & volatility of international crude oil rates, sometimes +50 paise, nextday -10 etc, cut of 1 paise is that daily adjustment
5361 2018-05-30 15:45:48 @sardesairajdeep loved the way you questioned oil minister who was clearly at loss of words. Whether it's Congress or BJP, the person at receiving end is always the middle class. If they reduce tax on oil, who will fund the farm loan waiver?
5362 2018-05-30 15:45:44 @dpradhanbjp embarrassed BJP. Why did he bring reduction of one paise? He could have advised oil companies to not bring cut of one paise instead it could be statusquo. @narendramodi @arunjaitley @AmitShah
5363 2018-05-30 15:45:39 Crude oil rises further as OPEC and non-OPEC output pact likely to continue.Saudi Arabia, other OPEC states, and non-OPEC producers will continue to cooperate until the end of 2018. Also, it was mentioned that any adjustment in global output will be gradual.

5368 2018-05-30 15:45:19 Salt Lake has changed a lot since Roseanne Barr lived here. According to my Uncle it’s filled with gay-loving leftist terrorists bent on drinking locally crafted beer while wasting oil located in our national parks....Thank god.

5371 2018-05-30 15:45:06 Oil prices have paused after a big drop on OPEC output talks   Saudi Arabia paid Trump $1B. Hence he withdrew from Iran nuclear program agreement. Now Saudi Arabia which attacked World Trade Center and controlled our dollar is big beneficiary and Trump.

5377 2018-05-30 15:44:50 Aren’t oil prices largely a function of federal and world forces? That’s why groups such as @GasBuddy can predict gas prices all over Canada days in advance.  Ontario policies costs are just a drop in the bucket whether it’s NDP, Liberals, or even #PCPO at the helm. #ONPoli

(Unless sensitive skin) exfoliating scrub of ground oatmeal, dash of water and oil
apply to face in circular motion

Wash off with our sandalwood soap (anti inflammatory). Pat dry
5411 2018-05-30 15:42:16 Modi didn’t reduce one Paisa... moron. The oil companies did.
5412 2018-05-30 15:42:11 U vl only include what is favourable 2 BJP..u r sold to them...i hate u...if u r dare enough n hv conscience ask them straightly y increased fuel price whn d crude oil is costing lesser than earlier...
5413 2018-05-30 15:42:09 Lol, salads, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, Brussels, anything green really. Tomato, pepper, and I oil a good on occasion. Try to do one raw veg and one cooked.
5414 2018-05-30 15:42:00 I tried repeatedly to get a @HillaryClinton sign, too. When I finally got one (from a friend who brought one back to me from Madison, a 3.5 hr. drive away), it got stolen. Should've rubbed it in poison ivy oil.
5415 2018-05-30 15:41:54 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5416 2018-05-30 15:41:53 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5417 2018-05-30 15:41:50 I have issue with taking Gwynn Morgan as a source of assurance. His oil and gas companies trespassed on land and had two sour gas leaks poisoned people and livestock in 1996.

5419 2018-05-30 15:41:41 Our prep cook wanted him to add chili flakes and/or oil to them.

5421 2018-05-30 15:41:33 Why don’t some parents teach their kids how to change oil or change a flat tire. You should know simple things like that.
5422 2018-05-30 15:41:22 Dentist appointment, oil change, tune up all before work
5423 2018-05-30 15:41:15 Consequences of the dumb and dumber running the White House these days...USA isolating itself more everyday!India will reportedly pay for Iranian oil in rupees as the two countries seek to bypass the US economic pressure on Tehran, industry officials have told the Sputnik news!
5424 2018-05-30 15:41:13 No. Never but hey really I need an oil change 
5425 2018-05-30 15:41:04 Yes, shea butter is too "heavy" for oily skin. I've tried it myself and my skin (which is oily as well ) was even more oily than before as it would't keep the oil inside.
5426 2018-05-30 15:41:03 Roasted with garlic and olive oil is pretty good.  They're not too bad pickled in a hot sweet brine too.
5427 2018-05-30 15:41:01 Speed 4.5 billion dollars to buy the pipeline, then start spending money to build it. It would be a more worthwhile project to just give 75,000 people unemployed 60,000$. Canada (including Alberta) imports oil at higher prices.We shouldn’t be exporting oil while this is happening
5428 2018-05-30 15:41:00 been told that right now there are 2 tankers a day passing through the waters and with the pipeline, they keep saying it will triple amount of oil sent down, and will increase tanker activity by one more tanker a day.. But how can that be? If the amount is tripled , how
5429 2018-05-30 15:40:59 maybe spoke too soon Gris - world's largest refiner in India announcing halt to Iran oil purchases per US sanctions, and RTRS reporting OPEC+ cuts to extend thru year end / no decisions made.  Walking back media / bears expectations.
5430 2018-05-30 15:40:54 Add olive oil to skillet. Toss in diced onion, whole cherry tomatoes and kale. Squeeze fresh lemon juice, pepper, salt and red chili flakes. Sauté for 5 minutes on medium-low heat.
5431 2018-05-30 15:40:54 No offense to Chicago's Finest, but DNC would probably Seth Rich him.
5432 2018-05-30 15:40:37 U ever needed olive oil for ur salad and j ran ur hand through luca's hair to get it?
5433 2018-05-30 15:40:17 Kenny has always supported this pipeline as well as all of Alberta’s oil industry.   One does not have to look very far to see that you are the one that has flip flopped.  Your entire time in opposition was spent opposing the oil sands.

5439 2018-05-30 15:40:03 SOMETHING the BC Government should be concerned about! They want to regulate pipelines and oil but have no say or Stand on shutting down thw Whale Watch industry and their self-regulations.
5440 2018-05-30 15:39:53 It was a waste of $4.5 billion +, because Team Trudeau did't want to be seen as anti environment. Now seen as anti oil & anti enviornment
5441 2018-05-30 15:39:51 Yes because as they were dragged or pushed away by cops in riot gear they were given time to clean up the camp. Really??? Thats the best you got? Tell me how clean is was the gulf after the Deep water oil spill? Was it cleaner then this camp?

5443 2018-05-30 15:39:48 Simple logic and little math sir. Oil prises were same in 2014 but wht abt the comodities ? They were also high and that is inflation. Now only oil prices are high but not the vegetables etc. And more important, the outrage is created, not on the ground.
5444 2018-05-30 15:39:47 Pusha cooking wit hot oil now....i gotta say im suprised drake got some explaining to do.

5447 2018-05-30 15:39:38 @IvanDaDrago you still holding that oil long scalp? (asking for a friend)
5448 2018-05-30 15:39:24 Oil is bouncing nicely off of $65 support, but we still think gravity takes hold sooner rather than later.

5451 2018-05-30 15:39:05 @MirrorNow Frustrating;-the Media do not understand the basic things. Not any price cut bydeclared by Govt, Prices gets revised everyday, as per the volatility of international crude oil rates, sometimes +50 paise, nextday -10 or whatever, cut of 1 paise is that daily adjustment,
5452 2018-05-30 15:39:02 Somebody needs to give PR lesson to OPEC+ , first they say that production could ride up to 1 million and now claims that if there will be any rise it will be gradual and that no volume has been decided. Decide before opening your mouth, dumb fucks ! #oott

5454 2018-05-30 15:38:57 Absolutely stupid argument. It is because of oil price hike.  If you don't understand and blindly criticise it is unfortunate.

5459 2018-05-30 15:38:50 Questions that media should be asking rUK
1) Where is rUK going to put Trident?
2) Where is rUK going to get its oil from?
3) Where is rUK going to get its electricity from?
4) Where is rUK going to get its drinking water from?
5) How is rUK going to pay off £1.7Trillion debt?
5460 2018-05-30 15:38:48 Hey Rajdeep why can't Karnataka gov slash oil price

5463 2018-05-30 15:38:28 Wow...has always amazed me on how oil prices seem to fluctuate/rise when certain groups gain control. Oh well, I get 25 miles a gallon and round trip to work is 6 miles so what the heck. Glad I didn't get that old Bronco I was thinking about.
5464 2018-05-30 15:38:27 Only thing happening is stockx ruining the market... these MFs like OPEC with oil prices...

5466 2018-05-30 15:38:25 You know how u stop the uncertainty. Instead of turning off the tapes to B.C. turn off the tapes to the states and stop giving our oil away too them for basically nothing!! Horrible time for liberals to be in power in this country. #canadanomore #f**ktrudeauandhisgroupofmeatheads
5467 2018-05-30 15:38:23 I use @doterra brand everything. They are the only essential oil brand I 100% trust. They make a muscle rub called deep blue that I love! They also have an essential oil called Cobiaba that has CBD and is testing more effectively than CBD from marijuana. I also reccomend-
5468 2018-05-30 15:38:22 Thanks to the govt. and oil companies for reducing the petrol price by one paise. The people of India will always indebted to you.  #EkPaiseKiSarkar #SafiNiyatSahiVikas

5471 2018-05-30 15:38:08 Yes, we are being burdened by oil prices. But by movie tickets too! Please raise your voice against movie theaters (PVR) too. We will be grateful, Sir.
5472 2018-05-30 15:38:04 Oil prices clearly show that Trump's America is an unofficial member of OPEC. Now both Saudis and American shale oil companies are making money in complete sync with each other. @CrudeOilPrices @oil_markets @OGJOnline
5473 2018-05-30 15:38:03 lol don’t let my rants about the oil industry discourage some of you guys, especially young guys fresh out of the Service, from getting into it. Ultimately it’s a great gig. You work 6 months out of the year, and have great pay and benefits.
5474 2018-05-30 15:37:58 Well at least they have oil.

5478 2018-05-30 15:37:37 #1PaisaFuelJoke.. Central and state government should be more clear to public in making clear why the price is high when the crude oil price is low. Also tell why and where the money is going and how the money is being used for benefit of the common man.
5479 2018-05-30 15:37:34 I can help out, I'll poke some holes into you, rub you down with salt and olive oil and wait for 90 minutes. bon appétit
5480 2018-05-30 15:37:33 @cathmckenna Please do your job!

5502 2018-05-30 15:35:59 Yeah they shouldn’t be paying for the pipeline, they should let the market dictate that the pipeline should fail. We already import tons of oil at higher prices, exporting more oil will increase the demand for foreign imports of oil.

5512 2018-05-30 15:35:09 Petrol prices: Crude Oil fluctuates but why government taxes change? fix centre and state tax at say Rs 10. Importantly, benchmark oil company performance. Inefficiency of the public sector being exploited by the private players viz. Reliance Essar #EkPaisaJoke

5523 2018-05-30 15:34:12 You’re not thinking clearly. The fucking pipeline and stupid out of date oil and gas industry will kill our planet, not just our Country. We all have an interest in stopping this madness. FN peoples are far more affected, this shit goes through their homes and villages.
5524 2018-05-30 15:34:11 I wonder how could such a huge infrastructural work, for which @nitin_gadkari is collecting excise tax on oil, escape Modi’s attention. He lost an opportunity to organize a road show for its inauguration.

Repaired toilet valves, rerouted serpentine belts. I've changed oil & spark plugs. I just struggled to change my wiper blades.
5539 2018-05-30 15:33:10 @AnthonyGriz if crude oil settles above $75 in coming days, it looks like it has the potential for 2013 high $109? Will the trade wars and geopolitical issues give strength to the price going up or it will be capped between $60-$70? Your take?
5540 2018-05-30 15:33:08 Yes, but before that, I'm sure S&P said an independent Scotland would be rated very favourably. Although this was before the oil price crash (recovery now on an upward trend). Am I wrong?

5542 2018-05-30 15:33:04 Will you EVER STOP COMPLAINING!?!?!?! If you lived in an oil pipeline, covered in oil would you be happy? Can’t you talk about ANYTHING ELSE?

5562 2018-05-30 15:31:46 Oil is already being transported daily. This pipeline is about expanding the market for that oil through native land & wilderness to hazardous tidewater on which BC depends. Liberals have betrayed BC by siding with KM against their interests.

5615 2018-05-30 15:27:12 No, you are absolutely right - it is not a solution by itself. It needs coal or oil to be on standby at all times. And when you are getting 3.3% from wind (like right now) coal and oil needed to compensate.

5620 2018-05-30 15:26:39 Oh of course. But, oil moguls are not chasing novelty, they’re chasing billions. 
Selling oil may be more boring than selling subscriptions to your porn channel, which is probably mote fun.

It’s a fallacy to think that you should “chase your dreams”. Street musicians or bankers.

Dear @narendramodi ji, who has authenticed the goodness of your government's intent ??

Your ill intent is visible from the fact that you didn't pass on the benefit of  rock bottom crude oil prices to us for 4 years.

5664 2018-05-30 15:22:40 Let's stop subsidizing the carbon fuel industry and give those subsidies to the electric car and battery industries and make fuel efficiency mandatory. Until we do that we will continue to be held hostage to myriad vagaries affecting the oil/fuel industry.
5665 2018-05-30 15:22:40 A nuisance creator like the gentle journalist is either poor at understanding the nations economic position visa- vic the oil prices or too intelligent to pose such questions with ulterior moto of defaming the government of the day with his much evident journalistic skills.

5677 2018-05-30 15:22:02 Lol. Changing your own oil is a hassle. I have a 9-5, I ain’t got time to be tryna find somewhere to dump no motor oil!
5678 2018-05-30 15:21:55 For shampoo I use the Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil Strengthen & Restore shampoo with the leave in Conditioner to go with it.
5679 2018-05-30 15:21:46 @RahulGandhi @hd_kumaraswamy @arunjaitley fertilizer. Cost of subsidy on oil for the year 2012-2013 is estimated to be Rs 43,580 crores and when the loss suffered by OMCs is also added to it, the total amount stands at Rs 1,14,000 crores.
5680 2018-05-30 15:21:35 Why? I know that Greenpeace fact checks everything. Or is it just that you don’t want to have to deal with their information? Oil corporations on the other hand have been exposed as having literally spent millions on fake scientists, disinformation and lies.
5681 2018-05-30 15:21:35 I'll broaden my horizons after Haters as human beings realize Global warming is more serious issue than expecting a price drop in oil which is Polluting and already Polluted New Delhi.
5682 2018-05-30 15:21:32 Yeah, taking inanimate objects from lawful people stops maniacs from killing 
5683 2018-05-30 15:21:32 I understand your efforts are targeted at the gas tax, but it doesn't add up to what we pay. I hope you may be able to help by requesting an audit of revenues by CA refineries/oil co's. It isn't clear how much profit they make, but it amounts for more than taxes and regulatory $
5684 2018-05-30 15:21:32 You're upset because your oil friends will not be able to take advantage of the pipeline to make money?
5685 2018-05-30 15:21:31 I support the fact we have to protect the environment, but we would fall behind if we didn't support this.
Countries will get oil from other countries whom don't respect the environment at all. Worse in the long run, actually short run.
5686 2018-05-30 15:21:17 Start using 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar instead of other salad dressings. You'd be surprised how much fat &amp; calories they have.
5687 2018-05-30 15:21:10 Sa chal waka Nu Without Oil working kai zaka waim.....
5688 2018-05-30 15:21:02 The feds made a decision to prop up a failing private bid to expand the oil sector in Canada, and they've done it with public money to the tune of $4.5B.  That's direct investment in advancing climate change and condemning Canada's economic future to fossil fuels.

5690 2018-05-30 15:20:45 Food pet peeve is seeing oil on my plate! Ugh or when it touches the other food on my plate how do people eat oily food
5691 2018-05-30 15:20:42 It's high time that the central and state govt both should cut excise duties on crude oil and look for other sustainable revenue sources. I don't blame any particular govt, both govt wants to have high taxes on crude oil, and market oil prices are not in our control.

5735 2018-05-30 15:17:07 And when the project goes over-budget and the pipes start leaking because of inept contracting and lack of supervision by the gov't, @JustinTrudeau will use his own incompetence as reason to shelve the project and further regulate the oil industry #TransMountain #TrudeauMustGo.
5736 2018-05-30 15:17:06 Kinder Morgan forced the government into this situation by giving a timeline ultimatum.  Perhaps oil companies got too complacent in Alberta after years of the Alta government subsiding their projects at the expense of Albertans while their investors got incredible returns.

5740 2018-05-30 15:16:14 @sumanthraman It is the prerogative of the oil companies to give discount or raise price of petrol. How can you question it in courts.

5747 2018-05-30 15:15:51 She did though. This pipeline boosts our economy, and encourages oil and gas growth. These are all taxable. Instead of a short term boost to what you stated, we know how a consistent source of taxable income.

5753 2018-05-30 15:15:27 Your still pushing this even though America now has enough oil to export. How about legislation that would prevent spring/summer gas price gouging of Americans.

5765 2018-05-30 15:14:34 OMC’s cut only 1 paisa today because they knew that prices are going to bounce back as soon as tonight.

5809 2018-05-30 15:10:51 If crude oil prices gone up 100% in past few months why people would expect that petrol/diesel prices should stay the same?
5810 2018-05-30 15:10:43 By the year 2040, most countries that buy crude oil from Nigeria will no longer need them...

5821 2018-05-30 15:10:08 #EkPaisaJoke The GOI shld immediately give relief to consumers by slashing income tax & also GST on essential commodities immediately is one way or else reduce the excise duty on Petrol & diesel and let the oil companies obsorb the losses.

5825 2018-05-30 15:09:55 Meanwhile we will continue to import oil and gas from foreign countries.  Something the Liberals will gleefully carbon tax the hell out of... and prices on any service or good in Canada will continue to go up in cost because end-users ultimately pay those taxes

5828 2018-05-30 15:09:48 I hate getting oil changes, they literally try to do a billion different things to my car and basically speak words that are out of my vocabulary and it makes me uncomfy and they also look at me like I’m a big dumbass

5836 2018-05-30 15:08:53 lets get specific now shall we? big oil companies like @chevron and @shell control the main prices of oil and gas, especially on holidays, when travel is heavy. they make more profit if they raise it on a holiday week/weekend than on a normal week. prices will slowly drop again.
5837 2018-05-30 15:08:47 India's Reliance Industries, owner of world's biggest refining complex, is planning to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources said, in a first sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. #OOTT #Iran #India #JCPOA @realDonaldTrump

5840 2018-05-30 15:08:40 It has everything to do with this thread and how the enviro lobby is running this country.  Resulting in policy (#carbontax) that has prevented invstmt in oil & gas developmt/pipeline invstmt.  Which has in turn led to gov having to step in and buy this pipeline.  Follow me?

5860 2018-05-30 15:07:35 Thanks Sam. These are great reads. 

Just to confirm I'm reading this right, based on your analysis, ARK believes that global oil demand will peak sometime in 2019/2020, never quite reaching 100mbd, correct?

5906 2018-05-30 15:03:59 If your really want to serve your country there is an imminent opportunity, in face of the rise in the international prices of oil which is eating into the country’s growth please conserve oil by reducing its consumption.

A trend will appear and it won't be linked to climate change or the environment.

5926 2018-05-30 15:02:06 India to understand hike in the international oil price increases the outflow of foreign exchange,essentially the dollar,the problem is further compounded by the costlier dollar,if taxes are reduced to make petrol cheaper there will be less money available for the development.

5929 2018-05-30 15:01:53 A dull one. At current rate, ignoring Thorium (a pipe dream), we will run out out of fissile product around the same time we run out of Oil and Coal and Gas. We are basically getting double time for the transition to "renewables" which have carbon cost exceeding Uranium.
5930 2018-05-30 15:01:51 Investing to expand Alberta's dirty oil is the absolute worse thing to do with Canadian taxpayers' money. Canadians are also going to be directly liable if and when there is a diluted  bitumen pipeline disaster. #KinderMorgan
5931 2018-05-30 15:01:44 Have you seen any financial numbers (ROI) estimates of selling price of oil, operating costs, maintenance costs, royalties generated etc etc for the KM pipe line. There seems to be a dearth of data.

1. Global price goes down: 
Wow,

 be nationalist & be stripped.

6000 2018-05-30 14:56:49 You own a pipeline that will carry your oil to the open market. While I'm not JT's biggest fan (ok, not a fan at all), if YOU owned more of your infrastructure/ resources, you'd be like Sweden ie. have the best of everything. But, you're too smug and ignorant about that stuff...
6001 2018-05-30 14:56:48 been there done that. regretted it too. tak boleh sentuh apa pun even angin tiup pun sakit!! tidur pun static macam mayat. best is letak olive oil kinda soothes and cepat hilang sakit!
6002 2018-05-30 14:56:47 Got all new tires. Now I need a oil change & Miss Daisy is all healthy 
6003 2018-05-30 14:56:46 You should hv attached to it,this explanation in the scripture context,I thought u were speaking conventionally, I understand you.
6004 2018-05-30 14:56:44 Courage? You call waving a bunch of signs, ,screaming and yelling courage? Living like pigs in makeshift shelters, courage? Supporting foreign oil from 3rd world countries, with disgusting human rights, courage? Using foreign money to destroy our country, courage?
6005 2018-05-30 14:56:42 Your "solution" is to make everyone soft targets, put everyone in the same boat as the kids who have to wait minutes for the police, who may not go in (ie Parkland)
6006 2018-05-30 14:56:39 You’d be a good choice..
6007 2018-05-30 14:56:38 I agree the company is incompetent but the oil is being shipped to world not the us. this line would actually increase profit margin, royalties  for all and that's a good thing. right now we are pretty much giving away our oil at an insane discount this would end that.

6009 2018-05-30 14:56:26 We must not assume a von Clausewitz explanation.

Oil price has little to do with it. It's all about capital supply. 

Drilled like crazy when capital began to overflow in early 2016 after crude price bottom. Frack crews and pipes lagged drilling but now catching up.

6011 2018-05-30 14:56:10 Nu ska alla svenskar lasas på livstid, för då tror Löfven att alla våldtäkter, skjutningar och arbetslösheten upphör. Sen höjs skatten till 110% efter nästa valvinst och inga företag tillåts gå i konkurs. Venezuela here we come, but no oil.

6205 2018-05-30 14:43:41 Buying the TMX project isn't an investment in the future when fossil fuels destroy the planet. This project lacks vision and fiscal sense. As well, it is humiliating that a Texas oil company delivered an ultimatum to Canada and we capitulated to them with this buy out. #cdnpoli

6208 2018-05-30 14:43:15 Right now our plan is "We gotta build this pipeline!" That's it, there is no more. Our plan is based on selling off the oil sands for pennies, while saying "but we'll make it up in volume", & KM's plan is "take the money and run". Burning all the oil won't reduce CO2 emissions.
6209 2018-05-30 14:43:13 You are proving as PAPPU every day by putting like this tweets. Price of fuel was controlled by oil companies, not by modi.

6222 2018-05-30 14:42:02 Price hike in petroleum products are done at the behest of PMO office in connivance with PSU Oil companies. Those companies are highly profit making to the tune of Five/six thousand crores at the cost of common man. Agitate before Oil Company Offices at KOLKATA and other state.

6238 2018-05-30 14:40:58 It is travesty that inspite of 4% decrease in crude oil prices, petrol product  decreased by learned government simply to 001 paise, even after 16 days hike. It is a quarrel laugh on democracy .

Can the government atleast fix the amount they earn per litre??? Why are they benefiting every time there is a price change.

6257 2018-05-30 14:39:46 The reduction comes after 16 consecutive price increases since May 14

The reduction in petrol and diesel prices was on Wednesday revised to just 1 paisa a litre each, with State-owned oil companies blaming clerical error for previously announcing a cut of up to 60 paise.

6274 2018-05-30 14:38:17 Comedy from abroad?? Congress let the control of petroleum price to Oil companies. The fluctuations according to international price is done by these companies now. You still think it's Modi doing 1paisa cut??  Pity...!!!

6276 2018-05-30 14:38:04 It's important to talk about @BJP4India double standards on petrol price.
31st may 2012..if you remember BJP did a Bharat bandh. Reason being petrol price hike. Barrel crude oil costed $117  then. Still, 1ltr petrol was under 80.

6303 2018-05-30 14:35:30 But is that treaty even legal considering that it was signed in 1968 when the Shah was in power and before the new Iranian constitution and present form of government? I believe that is why the oil markets are ignoring it. They have already built that factor in.
6304 2018-05-30 14:35:23 Not defending it, just knowing my own role in it's continued use. It's great to hear there are ppl like you making changes. The more of us that look to reducing our own use of oil related products, the less valuable it becomes. That's how we as consumers effect positive change.
6305 2018-05-30 14:35:22 This is why I say if you're going to buy ,ship ,sell,consume, do your research. CBD oil much of the time has 0.03% THC amount in it. They don't add it to the oil, it's naturally there already. From my understanding straight up hemp oil does not have that percent.

6341 2018-05-30 14:31:58 I think one also needs to look at the economic benefits for spinoff. Higher price for oil, employment, industry supported like hotels etc..
Railway is worth less than products it ships. Without rail then what

6348 2018-05-30 14:31:10 I did! I trim them whenever I bleach my hair because they end up looking fried, I use coconut oil and leave in conditioner to make my hair grow faster and then i just use a bunch of oils for the rest of my hair (esp. argan oil) to make it feel healthier!

6350 2018-05-30 14:31:08 @dpradhanbjp Sir please tell us when was the fuel prices raised by Oil Marketing Companies have increased one paise with increasing in crude oil prices and how this decrease happen when you places oil pricing mechanism.
6351 2018-05-30 14:30:58 Nowadays, many savouries are fried in unhealthy, processed vegetable oil.

While healthy savouries do exist - why does Ramadaan become the month of consuming much more (i.e. 3 course meals) compared to the rest of the year?

Its against the sunnah of Nabi sallalahu alaihi wasalam

6359 2018-05-30 14:30:16 A friend pointed out $4.5B would buy 900 wind turbines, employ 40,000, generate 1.6gw power. That's not enough jobs to account for the entire oil patch--but Trudeau's in an historically unique position of creating an industry (legal cannabis) that could employ the rest.
6360 2018-05-30 14:30:12 Nope. That’s wrong. You’d be deemed a new nation with huge existing debt. Currently higher than Greece.
Oil no where near profitable for Scotland.
6361 2018-05-30 14:30:09 Try selling me shitty essential oil kits and kitchen knife sets 
6362 2018-05-30 14:30:02 TIL that Nestle Smarties are all the same flavour except the orange one, which is flavoured with orange oil.

6364 2018-05-30 14:29:48 Things I would tell my younger self: broccoli roasted in a little olive oil with salt is fucking delicious. No more hiding soggy steamed broccoli in the cat’s food dish.
6365 2018-05-30 14:29:45 The finance minister alluded to Canada maintaining a positive climate for investors in his speech yesterday.  What positive investment climate?  International oil companies have been selling assets for the last 3 years
6366 2018-05-30 14:29:23 Finally government realises our hardships and reduces the price of oil by 1 paise. So considerate
6367 2018-05-30 14:29:18 The hook for 4.5 Billion PLUS all the 7 Billion more in new pipeline, now please show me 1 example where gov’t is efficiently run in a business model? How about all oil companies are now competitors with the gov’t in pipelines, PETRO-Canada ring a bell, Air Canada? @cbc ? Brutal
6368 2018-05-30 14:29:17 There are some days that I really feel like I've learned a lot over the last 6 years working at this lab, and then there are days like today where I find myself on a conference call discussing the miscibility of oil in the Middle Bakken and I realize I'm still a total idiot.
6369 2018-05-30 14:29:16 Saudi #oil Prince telling @SaraEisen @SquawkStreet that "oil is currently balanced" and they have NOT made any decision to raise anything. They understand "$80 maybe too high BUT $70 is TOO LOW". especially for U.S. producers.

I am eating: wholemeal, high fibre, natural yogurt, fruit, veg, salad.
Also good recommends are - green tea, vinegar, olive oil - esp olive oil+bread!

6372 2018-05-30 14:28:53 Do yourself a favor this summer. If you get sunburnt...rub organic apple cider vinegar on your burn. Then once it dries put organic coconut oil on  no pain and turns your burn to tan over night
6373 2018-05-30 14:28:51 Red raspberry leaf tea. Peppermint oil on your lower belly. Child's pose. A warm shower or bath.

6375 2018-05-30 14:28:44 @LidlUK Bought Casaburo Olive spread from your store mistaking it for Olivio Spread and it tastes awful. Checked the label only to find it has 0.9% Olive oil. Surely this is misleading customers into thinking its made with olive oil. @TSScot #lidl #tradingstandards
6376 2018-05-30 14:28:44 This daily revision of petrol/ diesel price is absurd as oil is not bullion. Also retail price may be fixed based on range of crude price list 60-65$ , 65- 70$ & so on. This will price stability. Also govt must cut duties for crude beyond 75$. @dpradhanbjp @PiyushGoyal
6377 2018-05-30 14:28:32 finna get my oil changed and get on the road
6378 2018-05-30 14:28:30 It started a long time before there was any living democrats or republicans but I guarantee you republicans have used more often for, oil and natural gas. You know what, you don’t know shit, just what the conspiracy theory whack jobs spin out for a buck, it happens on both sides.
6379 2018-05-30 14:28:17 You shouldn’t have to use false lashes with every makeup look. Use some castor/coconut oil on them bitches and you won’t need false ones!
6380 2018-05-30 14:28:17 Been putting black seed oil on my beard too to get it to that clinical level 5
6381 2018-05-30 14:28:17 To suggest that if Canada doesn't supply oil to the world, no one will step to the plate is ludicrous. There is also a direct correlation between wealth in a country and the ability or desire to address climate change. Rachel has figured that out .
6382 2018-05-30 14:28:15 Lls ok I'm in riverdale about to get the oil changed
6383 2018-05-30 14:28:08 You realize Obama was separating children right?  And you weren't saying a damn thing about skyrocketing gas prices under Obama. You also realize the President doesn't set the oil prices right...and that our "reserve supply"!will do nothing to drive the price down.

6385 2018-05-30 14:27:57 More bs.

The fact is that you and others like you don't want change.  For selfish reasons you want to drag the oil age out as long as possible.  And you're in denial about the impacts to the future.

I can't argue with selfishness and greed.  It has its own logic.

6387 2018-05-30 14:27:48 Wow that's a lot of oil coming once those wells are completed!!!
6388 2018-05-30 14:27:48 $ comes from threes sources: $625k in city parking revenue, $625k  in transportation impact fees, &  $250k from the BP oil spill settlement. City owns the bicycles & equipment.
6389 2018-05-30 14:27:46 Yes indeed, those jerks. Definitely getting that feeling too. And of course they had trouble with the ghouls at the Poseidon Oil factory and all other sorts of things too, so I'd say the game will heavily involve conflicts like that

6401 2018-05-30 14:27:00 Outstanding!! I knew you would be a good addition. Thanks Bro..  
6402 2018-05-30 14:26:46 It would have been better if the govt have decided to forgo the share of state taxes on increase in oil prices after it assumed office ie: from June 1,2016 as done by the previous govt led by Oommen Chandy Anyway something is better than nothing
6403 2018-05-30 14:26:40 That's the "forced visit" feature of ecosport. I can bet it is based on km's on odo, instead of actual condition/level of engine oil etc.

6406 2018-05-30 14:26:28 What did 'keep the oil' have to do with anything? 

All I did was mention how they'll pay and you quip with the non-thinking label of "xenophobic" which tells me you obviously don't think for yourself. There's nothing to take, you argue from emotions that are not your own.
6407 2018-05-30 14:26:19 During Karnataka elections 18 days were no fluctuations? Dollar and Rupee were stable?? International crude oil prices didn't increase?  Give us a break. Don't make fool anymore. You guys are incapable to lead this nation.
6408 2018-05-30 14:26:12 Crude oil price plunged by 5$/barrel in international market n today on the behest of Government Petrol companies decided to pass benifits directly to the costumers, Petrol and Diesel prices were reduced by massive 1 full Paisa/Liter. This is called #NaMoNomics #EkPaiseKiSarkar
6409 2018-05-30 14:25:53 Prevention, I mixed a little with straight citronella oil in a spray bottle. That helped til I continuously forgot it places lol
6410 2018-05-30 14:25:51 Why does my oil change and tire rotation cost $100? LOL buy your own car they say. It will be great they say.  I hate being an adult.
6411 2018-05-30 14:25:49 @GarySharp1620 When oil is booming, every Houston sports team's season tickets sell out. Houston is a city of business lunches and entertainment budgets. When oil slumps, everything dries up. That's why we don't have an NHL team, and my concern with OMA. Who covers $ in a slump?
6412 2018-05-30 14:25:44 @realFemiOtedola& @AlikoDangote,

Very likely that oil will be obsolete in the coming years.

What if we channel such huge investments into renewable energy?

6438 2018-05-30 14:23:53 So, Canadian taxpayers will now build our version of Trumps wall. I wonder how the Orcas will feel, having 3 times as many oil tankers cross their paths? Taxpayers are still waiting to be paid for last tanker spill in English Bay. Wonder how bitumen will taste in our waters?
6439 2018-05-30 14:23:51 As a middle class person I would suggest that the windfall taxes earned by the Govt due to hike in oil prices be utilized to strengthen the public transport system in the country and encourage electric vehicles to cut pollution. Let the taxes remain.
6440 2018-05-30 14:23:39 I hate that I have to come all the way to Downey for an oil change
6441 2018-05-30 14:23:39 There should be a nation wide referendum to stop this non sense. And from there whoever is against the national oil and gas industry should be on its own! No more equalization payments! Go find your own money to cover your expensive way of living!

6455 2018-05-30 14:22:57 Not wrong, but people aren't really that extreme, & want jobs & growth. It might be more accurate to views this as the power of the oil/business lobbies in Ottawa. There are also lots of people who don't understand how we can reduce emissions by burning more oil.

6466 2018-05-30 14:21:49 The speed of oil market clearing outweighs cautious hints OPEC may lift production quotes, #Brent and #WTI gain in value
6467 2018-05-30 14:21:44 Hahahaha .. back then gov would provide subsidy and price regulation was done by upa.. now nda ends subsidy and imposed haevy taxes and made oil companies free to loot. In return bjp gets heavy donations from those companies. Back thn crude oil was more expensive thn now also
6468 2018-05-30 14:21:41 I wonder how all those eco terrorists feel now that they partly own the dirty oil pipe from Alberta.  
6469 2018-05-30 14:21:39 Conservation or pumping for oil to make 45 and his followers more rich??  It’s all about pumping for oil!!  They will ruin that land and drain us of our natural resources and beauty!!  Bunch of crap!!
6470 2018-05-30 14:21:33 let @dpradhanbjp give a clarification on this stupid strategy of one paise cut. kerala govt. decision can wait. do oil ministry act with brains n logics on this issue!! already there is a built up anger on fuel price rise and on above this sarcasm

6472 2018-05-30 14:21:25 I had some bizarre dreams last night, one involved me not being able to find my contact book in my phone to add a phone number

The other one had a crawfish complaining about needing to put oil on his shell so he wouldn't burn and I need to make sure his son(human) did too
6473 2018-05-30 14:21:18 Exactly what they did they got their result in election but what are u guys doing many things were said in manifesto but nothing despite oil price down still price not reducing instead increasing

6477 2018-05-30 14:20:57 Love it when a $40 oil change turns into $250. Gotta maintain my Jeep.

6480 2018-05-30 14:20:33 We know a couple of those won't be around - The NCR grew from Shady Sands - a town in Fallout 1. The Legion was founded by the same Caesar from NV so it's a long way off. The proto-brotherhood is definitely a possibility, and maybe the Enclave if you can find their oil rig.
6481 2018-05-30 14:20:29 I'm very curious to see an oil demand analysis that assumes favorable scenarios for EV's share of ridesharing; autonomous ridesharing; the electrification of buses/ trucks. 

On autos specifically, most analyses assume 12k mi/yr per EV, but what if ridesharing doubled that #?
6482 2018-05-30 14:20:27 I don't know, which party wants to keep spending 700 Billion on wars that don't protect Americans, only monetary interests abroad. Personally I'd like to see the money spent on Americans. Not on missiles to protect oil fields...

6486 2018-05-30 14:20:05 Er.... Norway isn't too shy about selling Oil and Offshore Artic drilling,  in fact Canada is kinda following their example. Equinor (Statoil) has a large ownership by their government.
6487 2018-05-30 14:20:04 $bmo really good for Americans dollar $$$ 1 USD = $1.291 CAD. So do a math. Oil is up $ CAD will be soon $1.2529 pay commission stills make some
6488 2018-05-30 14:20:01 @realDonaldTrump you know the OIL COMPANIES git a MASSIVE TAX CUT & now gas prices are soaring & it is costing me $120 more per month for gas , WHAT TAX BREAK?

6490 2018-05-30 14:19:58 They’re total pieces of crap. As a true Jeep lover it’s embarrassing they allowed their badge on that fiat. SO many issues! Burns through 2 quarts of oil or more in less than 2k miles, fans going out, they catch fire, radios go out, windows burst, e brake randomly engages, etc...
6491 2018-05-30 14:19:55 I need to take ma car to get a oil change

6497 2018-05-30 14:19:12 Kevin it's oil consumption that's the problem not pipelines. If you want to reduce carbon in the atmosphere go protest a car dealership, make having kids and eating beef morally reprehensible and spend your energy on improving renewable alternatives to oil.
6498 2018-05-30 14:19:08 Massage with olive oil over the marks. Should work.
6499 2018-05-30 14:19:02 I can't even use it on my body. It produces little bumps. Now I have a huge jar of coconut oil. It makes incredible popcorn though.

6502 2018-05-30 14:18:54 Then and now Petro price discussions comparisons are misleading , debate then and now Oil cost/ Petro Tax. Debate why Govt to remain so much dependent on revenue from PetroTax when economy is growing @ > 7% ?

6522 2018-05-30 14:17:05 True but, as has been established, that has OBC written ALL over it. That was the first trade Chiarelli made as GM and he was clearly influenced by it. Giving up picks for a former Oil King? That's OBC thinking.

6527 2018-05-30 14:16:56 incorrect - remember post-brexit the pound will drop and for a nation that is a net exporter that is good news. In the interim, Scotland is creating its own central bank and scots pound.
The lender of last resort is also moot as Oil would underwrite the economy as it does the Uk
6528 2018-05-30 14:16:48 Your right. Yes tax payers plus Oil,whisky, gin, farming, Fishing, ship building, computer indst, tourism plus loads more.  As I said to you before this might not be enough so we’ll have to borrow from world bank for a few years But not to the tune of £2trillion.

6545 2018-05-30 14:15:30 Is the 4th wave of Oil soon to come down or will it go to highs and go down from there?. i have set a buy out at 65.80 which im hoping it's the barrier it's soon going to hit
6546 2018-05-30 14:15:29 @VinnieTortorich Algae oil???? Is it good for you?
6547 2018-05-30 14:15:25 @JustinTrudeau bad decision.  KM oil spill in last week.   Business case for oil sands to be profitable requires oil $ per barrel to be very high.  Put money into clean fuel for +jobs!
6548 2018-05-30 14:15:16 The key words being "passes through", which obfuscates the reality. The potential impact of an oil spill will directly affect the waters of FNs whose land/water the pipeline does not pass through.
6549 2018-05-30 14:15:11 Do you even understand how the oil industry works? Whats the price per barrel right now vs one year ago?
6550 2018-05-30 14:14:59 Didn't breaking up Standard Oil make Rockefeller even wealthier? Not against that, just thinking it aligns with your tweet.

6557 2018-05-30 14:14:28 Mueller doesn't matter.
Economic growth has slowed down dramatically in 2018.

Oil and gasoline prices are surging.

6558 2018-05-30 14:14:19 Is it because there is no oil in Puerto Rico?

Others supplied much worse food, juice/soda.
6595 2018-05-30 14:11:26 Mam, can we atleast request the state and Central Government to fix the amount they earn per litre - in Fixed Amount, not as a percentage. Why should the government benefit each time there is an upward swing in crude oil price.
6596 2018-05-30 14:11:23 #EkPaisaJoke no answers @dpradhanbjp ? How much #Petrol #Diesel is consumed by government?  What perks do Oil Companies employees get?  @IndianOilcl shame on you for this joke.
6597 2018-05-30 14:11:18 Reasonably good coffee, wifi, and a prime selection of 70s nostalgia hits (ABBA, BeeGees, Steely Dan) on the radio. I may bring my car for an oil change more often.
6598 2018-05-30 14:11:13 I don't understand it, it's like creating a masterpiece, then allowing people to come in and throw black oil paint all over it for free. It's pure insanity. Why would anyone want their creation to be so corrupted?
6599 2018-05-30 14:11:08 Going to be cleaning the car out and getting oil changed today or tomorrow . Gonna be a hot one today stay safe and cool
6600 2018-05-30 14:11:08 Yes. Also ask your anti pipeline crusader @jjhorgan to follow your footsteps and stop crying when Alberta turn the tap on oil. Use other tools than "Hammer".
6601 2018-05-30 14:10:58 Parut jerawat. Try organic product. And also apply bio oil or any antiscar oil/cream.
6602 2018-05-30 14:10:34 While still pale remove and cool a bit and shake. Place back in oil slowly to cook to golden.

6617 2018-05-30 14:09:41 Again, the use of computers is a piss poor excuse to support the pipeline - it is the ONLY thing people can say when defending the pipeline...soon oil and gas wil be obsolete and our Grandchildren will have nothing

6625 2018-05-30 14:08:45 It's amazing that CONServatives @CPC_HQ dont mind a Texas oil company benefitting from OUR resources but scream when Govt of Canada invests in same oil project to ensure it is built and grow our economy and public coffers. In end Govt will sell and profit.
6626 2018-05-30 14:08:29 Which government is responsible for dealing with oil companies?
Why centre government is not putting oil under GST(majority in state council)?
6627 2018-05-30 14:08:27 Imagine economists with ‘reservations’ (assumptions)? FACTS: The Canadian people just spent $4.7 Billion on a paid-in project; plus untold billions for a pipeline, negotiated by leaders, cough, who know nothing about the business after PM says, in France, he wants out of oil!
6628 2018-05-30 14:08:27 This isn’t an investment. It’s a ransom that should not have been paid off the backs of taxpayers. As the hostage was Justin Trudeau’s do nothing record, he or his best new buddies, the govt of Alberta and oil sands producers like CNOC should do the “investing” not roc taxpayers.
6629 2018-05-30 14:08:27 I guess poorly prepared oil might contain sufficient contaminants (eg butane) to be rather toxic, especially for the immunocompromised. Not sure immediate death the only concern even with distillation?
6630 2018-05-30 14:08:22 You could argue that Queens is not part of these United States. lol

6635 2018-05-30 14:08:14 Oil Ministry is trying to play Robinhood. They loot the money from public and return them as welfare schemes.

Pls do some serious efforts to reduce oil prices. You should not be black spot on Modi Govt brilliant work
6651 2018-05-30 14:06:24 I just heard on times channel petrol min states that center does not set petrol prices but the oil companies then y did BJP demand took 2 the streets the UPA to cut prices when $130/B i pd78/L......$30/B i pd70/L rightly sd govt can't give subsidy then reliance wil not b entitled

6657 2018-05-30 14:06:01 I didn’t vote for Trudeau so that he could unilaterally spend my tax dollars on the purchase of an American owned oil distribution company. If the cost of a dilbit spill cleanup is so prohibitive to insurers, why should we be on the hook for that too? It’s an outrage!
6658 2018-05-30 14:05:56 it wild

6662 2018-05-30 14:05:32 Given costs of #fossilfuel industry subsidies, environmental, healthcare, clean-up & other costs, it's a myth that oil & gas drives Canada's economy. It doesn't. We have backed ourselves into a costly corner & @JustinTrudeau made it worse. Madness. #cdnpoli #StopKM #NoKMBailout
6663 2018-05-30 14:05:20 @Franklin_Graham can not wrap brain around the sale of 100 Senate seats , also Math , 50/50 = 95/5 : soup and oil for 95%
6664 2018-05-30 14:05:13 But being completely dependent upon oil for everything does. Blocking our own oil results in our country having to purchase oil from regimes with horrible human rights records. Wind power kills birds. Solar kills birds and contributes to warming. Use less by not flying.
6665 2018-05-30 14:05:05 Government is making fun of innocent citizens ..it's time to speak up Mr. Prime Minister ...why pm is not twitting anything related to oil price hike ??...where are those who were very vocal in twitting at the time of UPA govt...
6666 2018-05-30 14:05:01 Wait, how hot are you letting your oil get and what super watery thing are you tossing in there? I just angle the lid like a splash guard when I toss onions in. If your pan is actually spitting oil...um...

How the oil companies formulated the pricing explain. If you can, your channel's rating goes high. Govt has nothing2 do with price increase.
6669 2018-05-30 14:04:43 Sir, don’t just jump into conversations.The question I posed to your friend that I’m extending to you is to point out ONE single thing an Igbo did against the Ibibio people. Don’t come here with that slave mentality. I’m not the one imposing myself on your so called oil.I trade!
6670 2018-05-30 14:04:42 You forget to add the following:
1) crude oil price
2) Foreign reserve
3) Population growth and demand 
Economic analysis is a holistic system. You don't have price in vacuum. Event led to those prices. We went into recession and no reserve to cushion the effect. The country's..

6677 2018-05-30 14:04:11 Cali people will always pay alot more. But when gas prices go up. Alot more jobs open up for oil companies. Which helps our over all economy. It's a cycle. It cant stay real low and it cant stay real high. Highs was seen with Obama but he had 8 years. Trumps had a year.
6678 2018-05-30 14:04:08 Media is misleading the viewer by the Headline. It should make clear that 1 paisa reduction is the daily  adjustment in price what  Oil Cos do. For major reduction Centre & State should reduce it's  levies. Levies don't go to Oil Cos. Highlight  that Levies not yet reduced.

6730 2018-05-30 13:59:12 @Richardafowler saw you with Bill. Big fan but be honest about gas prices. Oil/gas prices are a function of supply and demand. "Trade wars" are no impact oil prices. Iran tension(Iran oil sanction=disruption fear ), oil cost up=vibrant economy big demand. US net exporter of oil.

6734 2018-05-30 13:58:51 This is what Ottawa wants. They will control Alberta either through ownership of the pipeline and restricting exports through/closing it down or charging excessive prices to transport the oil. C’mon Alberta wake up. This is only bad.

They appeal only to the uninformed. Plus . . . oil prices lead gas prices, and they're down $5.

6740 2018-05-30 13:58:15 Instead of wasting time on twitter on  #EkPaiseKiSarkar, how about brainstorming on the #OPEC cartel and arriving at possible solutions? Give a thought on how to reduce our dependency on oil and methods to counter.

6750 2018-05-30 13:57:34 Precisely what Ottawa wants. They will control Alberta either through ownership of the pipeline and restricting exports through/closing it down or charging excessive prices to transport the oil. C’mon Alberta wake up. This is only bad.
6751 2018-05-30 13:57:30 Try out, jojoba, calendula and/or avocado oil
6752 2018-05-30 13:57:28 Note the "successes" of Trump as POTUS so far:

1. Tax Cut that made the rich richer
2. EPA director undoing as many environmental regs as possible to benefit business
3. Oil company profits rising
4. Trump properties worldwide being used for govt biz

It's ALL about the money!
6753 2018-05-30 13:57:26 We're starting huge selection runs in multiple #ACMPR facilities; high oil, high CB & rare CB vars will be available for licensing in the not too distant future

6765 2018-05-30 13:56:09 Does the President of the oldest party not know that petrol/diesel prices are not decided/ published by the PM? The oil companies decide based on the laid down mechanism. 

Stop this ridiculous politics. It is embarassing now. Develop a vision/ agenda which is 'for the people'.
6766 2018-05-30 13:56:05 That govt been doing since when Govt decided not to pass on the benefit of Oil starting from $30 a barrel till today to $ 80 compared to => $ 105 or so when Govt took over at more or less identical ₹/$
6767 2018-05-30 13:56:04 What about oil price ?
6768 2018-05-30 13:55:59 Breakfast: zucchini asparagus peppers red onions sautéed with olive oil and a lil soy sauce... so good 
6769 2018-05-30 13:55:35 The price of kerosene oil has been recommended to be increased by Rs 8.23 per litre and price of high speed diesel by Rs12.50 per litre.

6772 2018-05-30 13:55:19 For one year I think that the Oil should just trade the #10 pick to get someone with experience that they need, for the Oil has had enough of "prospects", just look at last season, they all seemed to SLUMP at the same time.
6773 2018-05-30 13:55:18 went to jiffy lube last friday. they say, 'come back monday. we'll have your oil'

6775 2018-05-30 13:55:05 The president needs to release the oil Reserves to get gas prices down during the summer save our tax cut and let people travel for the summer help the economy.
6776 2018-05-30 13:54:59 Collectively the world can only use a fraction of the remaining oil, so it makes no sense to develop the most damaging and expensive reserves. Canada has thrown away billions on the bitumen sands. Billions more now will just add to the waste
6777 2018-05-30 13:54:59 Hi Ronald, sorry to hear that you've had problems. Conoco is a Phillips 66 branded gasoline and retail service provider - @conocophillips doesn't retail gasoline anywhere. We only produce oil and nat. gas.
6778 2018-05-30 13:54:42 Some theories have emerged. A) Private industry esp energy companies cloudseeding to hedge water.

6784 2018-05-30 13:54:05 Republicans always speak in 180 degrees. They call themselves responsible but never take responsibility. They call the democrats “deep state” when we know that’s the military contractors, oil and the too big to fail banks. Big corp establishment benefiting by repub. Tax cuts.

6792 2018-05-30 13:53:35 We bailed on the Iran deal and reissued the previous sanctions. We got a lot of oil from Iran so now trump is trying to get his friends Russia and Saudi Arabia to take up the slack. So don’t expect oil prices to go down anytime soon. Are you tired of all the winning yet?
6793 2018-05-30 13:53:26 I'm at the dealership waiting to get my oil changed and 1) this waiting room is pretty nice 2) they have free coffee and 3) SOMEONE BROUGHT THEIR DOG AND HE'S SO CUTE AND FRIENDLY
6794 2018-05-30 13:53:21 @POTUS If we are a net producer of oil, flood the US market with the US reserves to lower the price at the pump, which takes away a DEM election issue. As a net producer, the reserves will simply be refilled with a higher average cost that would be funded by the budget surplus.

でも返してくれるの嬉しいですww
6807 2018-05-30 13:52:38 @CBCKelowna Would love to hear more of the silent majority coming out to support the pipeline. Let Notley cut off oil exports to BC see what the impact will be. Higher gas prices might motivate the silent majority to come out in support.
6808 2018-05-30 13:52:31 Yes...USD oil bottomed on basically the day Trump announced "US Energy Dominance" strategy in late June & is up 75% since.  Gold has been capped with rising paper leverage despite a renewed drain on COMEX registered inventories that are now back down to near all-time lows

6810 2018-05-30 13:52:17 Olive oil. If your hair has give green you have over dyed it. The olive oil will suck some colour out and will nourish your hair that is lacking proteins. If that doesn't help then an egg. Mix it up pop it on your hair wait about 2 hours. It will dry completely solid. Wash it off

6819 2018-05-30 13:51:49 @TheCBDistillery sells 1g of crystals for $30. Dissolve in warm oil to make the strength of your choice. E.g., 50 g of oil is 1000 drops, so one drop would be one mg. That's a lot of 2.5 mg doses.

6828 2018-05-30 13:51:08 @SRuhle OPEC doesn't control the price of gas at the Chicago Commodities Market WALL STREET DOES! TRUMP had WALL ST.

6831 2018-05-30 13:50:56 On April 16, 2018 you stood with @EmmanuelMacron promising action on climate change. Mr. PM how are you going to explain now why you have just bought a project to ship dirty oil across pristine, environmentally sensitive areas against 1st Nations & an entire Province’s objection.
6832 2018-05-30 13:50:56 As for energy companies being stingy with their capital investment, that was happening worldwide due to the slide in oil prices.  Again, you're living in a fantasy world if you don't see how much things have improved in Alberta since the recession.
6833 2018-05-30 13:50:56 @BarwhsB I would like to know why no one has mentioned the price of gas.When Obama was POTUS the gas prices were constantly his fault. These are the highest ever.Trump did this by getting out of the contract with Iran. Is he now doing it for his rich oil friends so they make more

6837 2018-05-30 13:50:34 I disagree.... and there are many of us that do. If BC is so self righteous on helping Alberta get their resources to alternate markets then I support Notley cutting of oil exports to BC. That will be a true measure of their self righteousness. It will likely be one of the last.

6846 2018-05-30 13:50:04 Gary I think that's part of it, but in truth the current deficit is likely to be systemic (exc. oil price impact) and is because we have a widely spread population /ageing demographic requiring expensive services that Indy would gut.

The universalism is part of it but not all.
6847 2018-05-30 13:49:56 So if one can build a pipeline to carry oil that the world is still dependent on safely across provinces, eliminating tanker trucks and trains for transport, how is that not a good thing? Pipeline is the greenest transport option if done safely..

6875 2018-05-30 13:47:31 So we have a democratic system where MPs who come from a Remain constituency can ignore the demand of the people who voted them in, because elsewhere in the country a bunch of gullible voters fell for the the promises of a bunch of Vote Leave snake oil salesmen?

6877 2018-05-30 13:46:59 If you’re planning to bring a #car to campus, now is the time to make sure it’s in top shape. Make an appointment with a mechanic over the summer to have your oil changed and ask about other recommended checks and fixes based on your mileage.
6878 2018-05-30 13:46:55 Hm, I worked for an oil supermajor and I learned there is an enormous gap between forward-thinking and concrete acting. Shareholder value first.
6879 2018-05-30 13:46:47 Yes, he had been terminated because of CBD Oil ads. (Figured as much after watching @TheQuartering's first vid about it). Also it seems the company knew it would threaten his channel.

6904 2018-05-30 13:44:43 I support public investment in renewables and the green economy, too. And the Alberta NDP has done more of that than any government in the history of our province. That’s the “grand bargain” that makes it possible for a progressive government to rule in an oil and gas province.

6914 2018-05-30 13:44:01 Now I see how small you are in knowledge and economy.  PDP sold crude oil at 100 - 120$ per barrel.  APC inherited 29$ per barrel.  PDP left 33 states with over 10 months salary arrears that APC cleared through bailouts.  PDP left our roads in sorry state.  APC is fixing them.

6919 2018-05-30 13:43:31 This is absurdity to reduce petrol price by 1paise by oil companies.I don't know why such absurd decisions sare taken when polling is still going on.The govt itself give opportunity to opposition and anti-bjp channels to publicise such foolish decision.
6920 2018-05-30 13:43:28 So how do you propose we move oil to the refinery? Carrier pidgeon? Since BC and Alberta could not work it out, the federal government acted in the best interests of the country. Good.

Bt I felt cheated.Thanks!
7003 2018-05-30 13:36:18 The difficulty of being Venezuelan is that your country has the biggest oil reserves in the world and the elites will be always salivating to get that oil no matter how: starving people with santions is just 1 example, regardless if you're a socialist or a capitalist..

7014 2018-05-30 13:35:13 That's not the relief Govt has given. It's the price adjustment Oil Cos have given. Centre and State Govt should decide to let go of some of their revenue from the price of each litre. That Levey does not go to Oil Cos. They have already paid to govt as soon as they produce.

7028 2018-05-30 13:34:04 We could none of us produced oil and gas, and the shit may not be approaching so fast, but we would also be poorer and colder and more ignorant. If the world was warming anyway, we wouldn't have realised.

7031 2018-05-30 13:33:53 Robert Bryce’s latest  column on energy trends, this takeaway: Over the past decade, merely the INCREASE — I repeat, just the increase — in US oil and gas production is equal to seven times the total energy production of every wind turbine and solar project in the United States.

7054 2018-05-30 13:31:05 Then this is more concerning that our basic infrastructure is dependant on the most unpredictable and highly geo-political sensitive commodity , OIL. May be Govt is failing to understand that Other tax should suffice infrastructure building .
7055 2018-05-30 13:30:59 Luke have you noticed that oil and gold don't seem to move to the inverse of the dollar just lately?  It seems like the correlation I expect is not there, perhaps it's geopolitics.

7058 2018-05-30 13:30:43 The BC government does not own refineries as we know. Why did oil companies close the refineries? Consumers surely don’t want to pay for gas with the US exchange rate not being very friendly.

7132 2018-05-30 13:23:34 #EkPaiseKiSarkar Being in the era of Rs 2000 notes and Rs 10 coins, had forgotten the value of "Paisa".  But the petrol, diesal price cut has reminded us that paisa exists. Will the @IndianOilcl @BPCLimited and @HPCL inform when was the oil price was #hiked by a Paisa.
7133 2018-05-30 13:23:17 But risotto alla milanese is just risotto + saffron without beans or something else. Just oil+butter+onion - risotto - wine - broth (meat not chicken!)- saffron and a little bit of parmigiano and butter after cooking (and pepper if you want). Nothing else!
7134 2018-05-30 13:23:07 Two May 30 WSJ articles on the same page (B15) by the same author:

2. "U.S. oil prices extended their recent declines Tuesday. . . "

7196 2018-05-30 13:17:57 Yep, a few weeks after I did when #oil was still upper $40s. $GS is right on this. Better picks though are oil E&Ps who went cash flow positive recent quarters w/oil in low 50s.
7197 2018-05-30 13:17:53 I don’t believe that most Republicans see him as a train wreck. Look at what he’s helped them accomplish. They got their big tax cut, more National Park land to big oil, weakening of the Medicaid program, defunding planned parenthood; on and on. These are all Republican ideals.
7198 2018-05-30 13:17:35 Do you even Understand how Oil Pricing Works? As a self Called Future PM, You really Should! Oil Pricing always depends on the International Price of Crude Oil which India imports.
For Last 4-5 years intl. Price of Every Crude Oil has hit sky-high. which affects indian markets.

7203 2018-05-30 13:17:09 Y’all got any oil? Maybe we can oblige....
7204 2018-05-30 13:17:04 This view is largely dependent on movement of Crude Oil. If Crude were to back off to 58/60 Range it is more than likely to move toward 66/66.5 range. Doubt if RBI is going to allow this sort of depreciation.
7205 2018-05-30 13:16:55 Now that the Feds control TM the expansion will never get completed. This was just a way to shut down the project and "phase out the oil sands". I wouldn't be surprised if tariffs and dock bid premiums increase to make extra $ and punish energy companies.

7215 2018-05-30 13:16:20 Hahahaha you said it right. Even if Oil goes out of fashion, the money he'd make from it as well as the potential of other African countries refining with him will see him rake in so much that his generations won''t finish it.

7217 2018-05-30 13:16:06 Russia will definitely take a chunk out of that as they are biggest exporters of fuel oil and they are bringing on new cracker/Coker/hydrotreating capacity. Will depend on how much of that 1.3mbpd FO export they can convert.

7219 2018-05-30 13:16:04 You’re right, it’s thee amounts that come into question,
Really shot up in the summer of ‘08,

But, much like tin, I believe oil is withheld to force prices up sometimes, I believe that is happening now and Trump minions are doing it.
7220 2018-05-30 13:16:04 Thanks my friend, and yeah, that's fine. 

Yes, I have, but because they're oil based, they "weigh" on my lungs even more than smoke from regular cigs do. Have tried a few different "systems", but they just aren't really for me.

7222 2018-05-30 13:15:49 Heavy oil and probably shale oil are plenty, yet in my view there are signs of depletion of Brent type oil. There are signs that gasoline depletes very fast.

7268 2018-05-30 13:11:40 Malcolm Gladwell really started a fashion for that sort of spurious pseudo-sociological snake oil. Once it gets into the town-water-supply of public discourse, it's hard to filter it out.

Don't you think? I hope and pray there isn't enough oil and gas worth taking. The curse of oil has so far eluded us.
7400 2018-05-30 12:59:33 Plot twist coconut oil is no longer working for me. It’s actually drying up my skin now.
7401 2018-05-30 12:59:28 Bitumen is still flowing through existing pipes and a realistic timeline for cutting oil sands production to zero will take decades. Still, we're past the time where it makes sense to build any new production. It stops here.

Not because he's a "bad guy", but because he has the audacity to want to keep control of Venezuela's oil for Venezuela

7419 2018-05-30 12:58:16 That is a quote from 1991 - not excusing it but pointing out how it is a false equivalence
7420 2018-05-30 12:58:16 I thought that US was finished there. Afghanistan is still number one contry producing about 50% worlds heroin/opium. And America intervened there. So what does that tell us? That US make drugs in Afghanistan and is selling them all over the world. Nowdays they are more into oil.
7421 2018-05-30 12:58:14 I have no doubt that this will be disruptive, but so far I haven't seen anyone reference the numerous upgrading projects under construction that will convert a decent chunk of that 1.5 mn bpd fuel oil into middle distillate

7442 2018-05-30 12:56:54 Impossible to extract the signal (e.g., tax cuts) from the noise (e.g., everything else).

I would think 4 factors: (1) global strengthening; (2) higher oil prices fuel investment in that sector; (3) Keynesian stimulus from tax cuts and (4) incentives from tax cuts incl expensing

7444 2018-05-30 12:56:51 It was literally going to be built by a private corporation, an investor, until GOV decided to step in. Oil demand is increasing, not decreasing. There is no shortage of investment dollars chasing petro investment opportunities. #oil

7463 2018-05-30 12:54:28 If Alberta didn’t squander their Heritage Fund, during the last oil boom to boot, they could have bought their own pipeline. However, getting it through BC would still be an issue. What is this country thinking?

7508 2018-05-30 12:51:37 (1) Business fixed investment is new purchases of equipment/software/structures/R&D/etc..

(2) More equipment etc. means more productive workers and higher wages.

(3) Investment caused by many factors, most recently rising oil prices, a global rebound, and tax cuts.

7594 2018-05-30 12:43:33 That's because there is a powerful worldwide lobby that has been working actively against funding and developing effective technologies that will allow us to continue without oil in the future.

I'm surprised Scheer didn't just stay quiet, or maybe claim that his opposition pressure helped force this. Would Scheer be happy if the oil companies and workers were paid to leave the oil in the ground?

7662 2018-05-30 12:35:52 Very temporary relief but a few minutes of relief. I used a couple of drops of tea tree oil but you could try others. Steam helped a lot.
7663 2018-05-30 12:35:51 The loss of residents was due to a downturn in the oil and gas industry, as well. Unprecedented coincidence for this region.
7664 2018-05-30 12:35:46 I enjoy green leafies... I'm good with leaves swimming in olive oil. What sold me was the lack of mental fatigue and physical soreness after my last week playing with the symphony. Previously I would have been exhausted and physically sore all over my back, arms, and shoulders.

7671 2018-05-30 12:35:14 Basically he is not showing the science of how this was approved. His government also approved for BP to drill for oil off the coast of Nova Scotia. Alberta's climate change plan allows for a 40% expansion. Cop21 was just lip service we are not back as Trudeau said there.
7672 2018-05-30 12:35:14 @RubikaLiyaquat please talk sense... You must understand that BJP in power less corruption than the previous with many developments going on ... Here as a middle class of me support the oil price even if it's 100rs पर liter

7684 2018-05-30 12:34:18 Look. They don't care. We should stop all trade with China until they can be an equal and honest partner in trade. I bet if they were stealing oil instead of technology this would have been resolved years ago.

7699 2018-05-30 12:32:35 The problem with environmentalists is that they cannot concede that there is a price to pay for progress. Whether it is oil or any other industry, economic advancement has an environmental and social price. The mature discussion is “what price” and not “no price”.

7720 2018-05-30 12:30:49 The Oil Ministry as the affected ministry will always ask for the Excise Duty to be reduced. That is perfectly okay but they do not have to manage the finances

7801 2018-05-30 12:23:10 Hey, @ShahMohammadRe1, hows it going man, Still keeping those communists out? Hopefully yes,  the US and Britain were able to help contain em y'know around 1943, but now we just got a good thing going. #ShahMohammad #Appreciationpost- love you man(and your oil)
7802 2018-05-30 12:23:01 Oil Minister @dpradhanbjp: what happened with release of @IndianOilcl was a huge mistake and responsibility will be fixed #EkPaisaJoke @TimesNow
7803 2018-05-30 12:22:57 Bahi to bol rha hai in congressis or opposition ko asa hi proper tarika sa oil prices bhi kaam honga long term ka lia...people have to keep patience ..niyat saaf hai to sahi vikas hoga
7804 2018-05-30 12:22:49 It's handmade and I got it from one of those cute markets. The ingredients sticker are totally ruined probably from me spilling something and all I see is coconut oil, shea butter and beewax
7805 2018-05-30 12:22:28 about how ECB will start hiking cycle if oil goes up.  That demonstrates lack of insight into how the ECB has actually behaved under Draghi.
7806 2018-05-30 12:22:26 Oil change time for my little car. I’m hungry. Good thing there’s a breakfast place next door.
7807 2018-05-30 12:22:19 Why when one shows up for a SCHEDULED oil change, does it have to take one hour?!

7816 2018-05-30 12:21:11 Still don't u think 36% is a big number for a single unit? Let's import Indonesian coal, oil and now copper too.
Lets harm the economy Atleast in d way ppl can't see it physically. The deficit widens ppl shall all go back to paddy farming with breakthrough tech.
7817 2018-05-30 12:21:02 Absolutely. Oil cos are NOT buying oil on a daily basis.
7818 2018-05-30 12:20:55 Anyway Scotland is European Hard Rock viable farms Oil hydro-electric which is free apart from construction, Parliament, we could do with some European Banks buying out £ to make it safe now the Australians are locked in forever under control to protect Aboriginal peoples Tribes!
7819 2018-05-30 12:20:52 Can you imagine: 
- major cryptocurrencies going to zero
- crude oil at $200/bbl
- gold below $500/oz or above $2,000/oz
- stocks doubling or losing 50% or more of their value
- interest rates at double digits
- EUR/USD below 0.80

To be a good trend follower, an open mind helps.

7822 2018-05-30 12:20:37 TIL the French word for "oil pipeline" is "oléoduc". Such a cool word.
7823 2018-05-30 12:20:23 So normal people miss their ex when they're sad or angry, but my heartbreak didn't start until I was changing the oil in my car last night. Small breeze was blowing and I looked up at the moon and softly whispered

"Cheii. I may have played myself"
7824 2018-05-30 12:19:57 I voted "diesel prices are too hight", but this is an incomplete analysis. The core of the issue is the price policy of fuel / oil derivatives made by the new administration of Petrobras. So I guess that some people could vote for "petrobras is corrupted" for the same reason
7825 2018-05-30 12:19:48 What was the crude oil price then? For your information 112 USD then but 82 USD now per barrel.
7826 2018-05-30 12:19:38 I wonder if the quote wasn't attributed, would it get someone's account suspended?
7827 2018-05-30 12:19:21 Yes, it would appear so,oil light started flickering at 80 mph. The cab is always serviced regularly etc but has done 244k on original engine,still running ok,powerful etc but it's only a matter of time before it goes boom

7834 2018-05-30 12:18:40 Moody's has cut GDP growth forecast to 7.3 per cent from 7.5 per cent due to higher oil prices
7835 2018-05-30 12:18:36 Said I'd get up @ 8 to get a cut and oil change. Guess I gotta wait til tomorrow lol
7836 2018-05-30 12:18:19 imagine all the british petroleum, baker hughes, schlumberger, total petroleum, maersk drilling & chevron working in UAE for arab oil and paying them in pounds & dollars purchasing their dirty oil. But City haters have 1 argument, "Oil Money!"
Stop the f*** buying oil/petrol.

7838 2018-05-30 12:18:10 Some people need to get real. We are never going to compete with the money that clubs like City/United/Chelsea are paying. Our model is based on the likes of Bayern/Dortmund, self-sustainability. Yes, oil money is the quickest/easiest way, but it's not the only way #AFC #COYG
7839 2018-05-30 12:18:09 If you live where it is legal the dispensary can help you. If not, you would have to use hem oil. My understanding is that hemp is legal everywhere. CW seems good for neurological things. It will not get you high. It is not for that.
7840 2018-05-30 12:18:05 I used Nuln oil on the metalcolored parts, Carroburg Crimson on the red parts and Reikland Fleshshade on the gold parts. Will go over it again to try and make it pop a bit more. Thanks for the tip! 
7841 2018-05-30 12:17:54 As a ex oil industry employee, I do not agree with Government version that prices are controlled by Oil companies. The Govt has increased the taxes on petrol from Rs 9 to Rs21 and Diesel from Rs 3 to 17. Inaddition to this all state governments have increased taxes.
7842 2018-05-30 12:17:50 What was the crude oil price then? For your information 112 USD per barrel then but 82 USD now.
7843 2018-05-30 12:17:45 They shd let ppl know how these oil companies calculate the price at the pump on daily basis

Govt is not fixing price anymore, agreed

Let these companies tell us the formula, so that we can be sure that it is not arbitrary
7844 2018-05-30 12:17:39 Umm this *president has set the country back by 50+ years. People act like the Civil Rights movement never happened. Now he’s speeding up nuclear proliferation. He’s Putin’s bed buddy. Oil prices are sky-rocketing. Yeah, he’s doing a tremendous job, guys.

7849 2018-05-30 12:16:38 Boss,
Please mind your language.
Today is Petrol price is nearly 78/- per letter.
And 
Today is Crude Oil price is nearly 75/- per barrel.
7850 2018-05-30 12:16:35 And no North Sea Oil to flood into the economy either. Capitalism relies on exploiting the natural world too!
7851 2018-05-30 12:16:13 Hot cooked oats with beef bovril, spring onions, and fresh coriander. A dash of sesame oil helps sometimes
7852 2018-05-30 12:16:13 What should be considered when resettling people in the oil reach regions?  #oilgovernanceUG
7853 2018-05-30 12:16:11 Already spilled oil on the floor and myself. Today is shaping up to be a greaaaaaaaaat day

7855 2018-05-30 12:15:56 Refined palm oil should do the trick.

7864 2018-05-30 12:15:28 It doubles the amount of oil leaving Alberta into BC which doubles the spills (which happen frequently), doubles the pollution causes through extraction and refining, and doubles the tanker traffic in coastal waters.

7870 2018-05-30 12:14:50 I hope not. Not to start with anyway. Tankers would be a way of guessing flow rates. As in the planning permission 10-15 per day!

7872 2018-05-30 12:14:43 The most important point is that building the pipeline will not reduce oil in trucks or trains. We can’t refine dillbit here, so it’s all for export. No relation to domestic consumption.

7886 2018-05-30 12:12:57 Oil prices rising and taxes  collected for  managing the price not rising above a certain level not being used for that purpose, where is Carolyn Gomes, prominent figure in the gas riot of 1999? Can't she organize or be part of another strike #jfj
7887 2018-05-30 12:12:55 in 2013 oil was  Rs.4675 per barrel and petrol was Rs. 83. Now it is 5054 @$75x 67.39. So what should be the price Mr.Tharoor.? Rs.89.73 isn't it?
7888 2018-05-30 12:12:48 They really fixed the price for oil at 50 usd which means its situation is not stable.

7891 2018-05-30 12:12:32 Yes. It would really help India get its hand in the pot and have a hand up on bargaining. India is one of largest consumers of palm oil - a critical Indonesian export - linked directly to their fuel prices, power, tax rates and economy.
7892 2018-05-30 12:12:31 My guns are very well controlled, they’ve never killed anyone. As far as seeing the results of gun violence, I work in a level 1 trauma center, in a major dem controlled city with wait for it..... STRICT GUN CONTROL. Itdoesn’t work Numbnuts.
7893 2018-05-30 12:12:29 I don't think Trudeau's political calculus will end up in his favour here. Using public $ to fund dirty oil is a terrible idea.  The effects and the costs of climate change are only going to get worse - more and more voters will realize this.
7894 2018-05-30 12:12:16 Your takes are astonishingly childish for such a serious subject. It’s as if you have never come to realize you might have to defend yourself one day. Your development has been arrested along the way.
7895 2018-05-30 12:11:56 Where are we coming from? This admin made outrageous promises DESPITE falling oil prices then Buhari became president and took nearly 6 months to appoint a cabinet. Never seen a more foolish action in my entire life.
7896 2018-05-30 12:11:52 What are the exclusive NDA plans to insulate #India from world #Oil shocks or exchange rate problems. More than a low price, people would be happier with a #Stable price
7897 2018-05-30 12:11:51 If you look at my piece you’ll see a link to a report by the Stockholm Environment Institute. They find that expansion of the oil sands will counteract all elements of our climate plan, and slow the global transition. This is about expanding oil sands by 2-3x, all for export.
7898 2018-05-30 12:11:49 Warren, under no condition could I agree this is good policy, whether a pipeline supporter or not. The idea that JT would make taxpayers subsidize oil producers while insisting other Cdns lower their domestic emissions is worst case of “do as I say not what I do” hypocrisy.

7921 2018-05-30 12:09:41 It’s apples and oranges. Trucks are only used for local distribution, so really we’re talking about trains. The rail network is currently at capacity, it can’t ship more. The purpose of the pipeline is to increase capacity so the oil sands can expand and get that oil to export.

7930 2018-05-30 12:08:30 The price of oil would be well under $40 per barrel, that’s for sure.

I returned to Naij in 2015 cos I thought Nigeria would become great again.... pitched my tent in the Niger Delta & Lagos, sadly, the vision sold is not the reality .... and its not low oil nor. corruptn.
7935 2018-05-30 12:07:54 1 Paise reduction in Fuel Price by Oil Marketing Companies is a cruel Joke to all consumers.

Shame.

7937 2018-05-30 12:07:49 Too many mini crises - political uncertainty in Italy & Spain. Crude Oil prices, U.S. - China Tariff Wars.  Just too many hiccups. Need things to calm down. Suggestion - take less risk.

7943 2018-05-30 12:07:20 Trump is riding Obama's economy. Gas prices are rising because oil is easily subject to market manipulation and Trump's policies favor fossil fuels at the expense of everyday Americans.
7944 2018-05-30 12:07:13 Who’s the buffoon talking about refrigeration? That myth  was debunked by a former trade minister weeks ago!These countries are some of the wealthiest places on the planet b/c of oil. Our live export meat is being processed by them &  exported as packaged meat to sell in Europe!
7945 2018-05-30 12:07:07 What do you do if you want to shut down oil in #Alberta ? Or force a #carbontax ? Well --- buy the pipeline with the shut off valve. Then come up with some excuse to sell it to China. #KM #cdnpoli #Trudeaumustgo #Scheer4PM #Notleymustgo

7947 2018-05-30 12:06:59 #EkPaiseJoke an oil barrel=158.79 litres
1US$ = Rs67.40  therefore present crude oil price USD 67/ BARREL i. e Rs28.43 / Liter. Add .52 Paise refinery cost and Rs 6 as transportation cost and dealer margin as Rs 1.06. So at present the price of petrol shall be 34.95.
7948 2018-05-30 12:06:53 I just want to ask why the coeterie is missing the point?? All goodwill and hardwork of Mr Modi has been sent down the drain by the myopic decision of keeping fuel price excise duty and VAT as a function of Crude oil price! I think it is time for Supreme Court to intervene!!!

7953 2018-05-30 12:06:28 Since when are federal employees into making oil pipelines... they arent... this is such propaganda you should be ashamed you think Canada can build a proper pipeline...
7954 2018-05-30 12:06:28 I see no reason to believe you will build this pipeline. You have enacted legislation to discourage all investment in this sector, and you have stated you are sorry oil production isn’t already shut down.

7987 2018-05-30 12:03:29 I think that this is a super divisive issue. You have many who didn’t want this to happen, but you have loads of people from Alberta and beyond who need the work after oil and gas crashed a few years back. I don’t think anyone would be happy regardless...

8049 2018-05-30 11:57:04 Add to that, than when working in the oil it is really hard to vote anything other than GOP; it can mean an extra notice on your resume. Is not legal but what is,these days,right?

8062 2018-05-30 11:55:40 @PMOIndia Oil prices will b d undoing of BJP. National media, even those favouring BJP has taken up d issue. D money dat u r saving will be handed over to an opposition govt to squander & dat will be very unfortunate for India & those who supported BJP for governance!

8066 2018-05-30 11:55:16 @KeithOlbermann and his history of mental illness apparently makes him untouchable. We’ve watched him become completely unhinged over the past few years. Resist the hypocrisy #BoycottABC
8067 2018-05-30 11:55:11 GorT: 3of3 mentions the drug deals he sees at “triangle park” at N Cap and Florida Ave. I recount to him when we used to go to the McD’s at NY & Florida Ave.
8068 2018-05-30 11:55:02 Except that oil and coal have been receiving gov’t subsidies for decades
8069 2018-05-30 11:55:01 Their doings have not stopped to get the oil moving through the water shed @ Prince Rupert. Keeping folks busy down south while massive danger looms.
8070 2018-05-30 11:54:58 #EkPaiseKiSarkar Gadkari says if Govt gives subsidy to Oil cos. It will reduce funds for welfare. Lie! White Lie!! Outright Lie!!! If Govt offers subsidy 2 reduce Petrol price, it will not be available to Modi’s financier - Ambani - coz Pvt Cos like Reliance can’t get subsidy.
8071 2018-05-30 11:54:54 It’s a shame that I know the inverse of sin is cosecant but not how to change my own oil
8072 2018-05-30 11:54:53 Dudes screwed up cannabis legalization to make a suit grow a 10,000 year old cultivated plant for a human & now another rusting pipe needing oil.
8073 2018-05-30 11:54:37 Best beer. They don’t ship to US unfortunately. Neck Oil would be v popular here.
8074 2018-05-30 11:54:30 I’d rather ask why? There are thousands of non pipeline solutions including refining the oil in #Canada 
Green projects that will eliminate our dependence on oil. Literally any choice that doesn’t put more equity in a money pit.
8075 2018-05-30 11:54:26 If you put oil in before the sauce wont stick though??
8076 2018-05-30 11:54:21 i love # eli tomac riding kawasaki winning the race helen grace lucas oil round 1 and 2
8077 2018-05-30 11:54:11 What A catastrophe for this country. Even someone like me that doesn’t understand all of the nuances to pipelines and oil can clearly see what is going on here. We’ve been duped& KM must be laughing all the way to the bank #KinderMorganPipeline #TrudeauMustGo
8078 2018-05-30 11:54:08 Nah it’s all about temperature and oil. I have family members that cook in the shittiest pans and it’s always perfect. I will perfect it one day.
8079 2018-05-30 11:54:03 True. If there were a god such a Graham preaches for all but his family and powerful men who kowtow to him he'd be in a barrel of burning oil headed over a cliff into a dark and stormy ocean at night.
8080 2018-05-30 11:53:58 Never was about WMDs. It was always greed and power. Ask the oil barons Bushes
8081 2018-05-30 11:53:56 @JustinTrudeau got his own Oil Company just like his Dad... he should be so happy considering how well the Liberals run the countries finances this should never get built or be a costing nightmare.
8082 2018-05-30 11:53:17 Youtube made me spend R100s on Jamaican black castor oil and coconut oil and my hair still grows slower than a tortoise on a leisure walk. It's either your potion or it isn't

8091 2018-05-30 11:52:23 Bill Maher did a comic spoof on Trump’s lies about Obama’s birth. Said Trump’s mother slathered herself in banana oil+snuck into the orangutan cage at the Brooklyn zoo to conceive Trump+that Fred Trump was not his father. Demanded Trump’s birth certificate. Hilarious on  utube!
8092 2018-05-30 11:52:17 SIBC news: An RVL operated Cessna 404 coastguard pollution surveillance aircraft took off from East Midlands Airport this morning to investigate the report of an oil slick about 67 nautical miles east-north-east of Unst.  The drill platform Ocean Guardian is in the vicinity.
8093 2018-05-30 11:52:02 GST - No GST on Any Comodity in raw form (Food grain, Oil, Milk, Veggi, Fruits etc) on other Items max GST should be 20% ; No GST on Medicine for BP,Cancer,TB,Diabetes etc. Fuel price is one commodity which burdens everyone equally hence I dont suggets any cut in fuel price
8094 2018-05-30 11:51:57 GP It already is. Have you been there? The construction for residences is reinforced poured concrete (all utilities poured into the walls) on a slab. Tiny thick windows, etc. But the infrastructure? Nah, fam. Still burning oil.
8095 2018-05-30 11:51:56 Oil Minister @dpradhanbjp: this is not a political issue. Tax collections are used for developmental work. We are using money for the people not keeping in our party's accounts #EkPaisaJoke @TimesNow

Tuossa talvella tuttu nainen jakoi kuvaa siitä, kun oil Vegasissa paljasrintaisten Hunksien kanssa poseeraamassa. 

Kun nainen käyttää miestä seksistisenä objektina, se on vain hauskaa viihdettä. Samalla tavalla toimivasta miehestä tulee rasvainen setä...:)
8097 2018-05-30 11:51:41 Eco-terrorists from within the government and from without both who received financing from US pro and anti-oil interests have undermined the Canadian oil industry and cost Canada far more than $4B yesterday.

8101 2018-05-30 11:50:21 Modenas Kriss was based on Kawasaki. Imho, it's multiple factors. Mine stock standard, and I ride like old uncle. Always change oil once every 2months and never past 1000km/change. On Shell Advance AX7/semi-syn. Rm28/liter.
8102 2018-05-30 11:50:14 Oil Tip of the Day 

Essential oils really does help people. It makes me feel good that these oils are helpful with natural healing!!!
8103 2018-05-30 11:50:11 Yeah. Definitely. Not many people actually realize that there's link between pollution, decreasing immunity and parasite infestation. This could lead to spread of zoonotic diseases. I've seen similar in penguins who thanks to the oil spills are more susceptible to malaria.
8104 2018-05-30 11:50:09 @AdamMancini4 Hi Adam, any thoughts on the current oil situation? This sideways pattern is a bear flag, isn't it?
8105 2018-05-30 11:50:03 This Apple tastes like starter fertilizer and hydraulic oil. So much for trying to eat healthy
8106 2018-05-30 11:50:03 How about virgin coconut oil for heart health, Nina, Marika? Just bought a bottle yesterday. Is it a go? 
8107 2018-05-30 11:50:02 trump's campaign is currently accused of colluding with Russia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.

All 3 rely on petroleum exports to survive, and are profiting from rising oil prices due to trump's destabilization of the middle east and sanctions against other petro countries.
8108 2018-05-30 11:49:55 Despite a decrease of USD 5/barrel in crude oil prices in last one week and After continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel for 16 days, the Modi govt have decreased it by *just 1 paise a litre.This is making fun of the republic of India

8117 2018-05-30 11:48:30 I need to get an oil change today for sure
8118 2018-05-30 11:48:29 GP I call my Irish-American friends filthy Papist dirt-burning kid having bastards. Of course, I'm mostly Irish, too. And 100% Catholic.
8119 2018-05-30 11:48:20 Nepal isn't an oil producing country , gets subsidy in Oil price from India. The same oil gets sold to Indians through open border with the help of corrupt police and Custom officials , majority of whom are from Nationalist breed. [1/2]
8120 2018-05-30 11:48:19 Years before cement companies made a cartel and fooled  indians.competition commission of india slapped penalty of 8k crores. Still , oil companies are out of the surveillance.  Don't know why??

8122 2018-05-30 11:48:02 Yes, but having a oil company cross your land or Ottawa, there’s the difference
8123 2018-05-30 11:47:53 I haven't! Currently working through olive oil and salt.
8124 2018-05-30 11:47:53 #pmjt says selling more oil reduces Canadas carbon footprint .....  going to let Paris know the numbers once he has figured it out
8125 2018-05-30 11:47:53 if the oil prices are controlled by oil marketing companies (OMC) and despite of the fact that the crude oil was going higher why there were no revision in the oil prices during Karnataka elections #ekpaisajoke

8129 2018-05-30 11:47:31 That expected ROI is based on continued high demand for oil. I hope that won't happen. & it doesn't include economic effects global warming
8130 2018-05-30 11:47:19 And for someone who claimed to be supportive and respectful of Indigenous rights, the money he just dropped on oil could have given clean drinking water to  all those communities who can’t drink their own. Unbelievable. He really did fool us.
8131 2018-05-30 11:47:18 He’s a classical liberal, he’s not about socialmis at all, listen to him he is a defender of capitalism, he is from the oil province of Canada.

8134 2018-05-30 11:46:46 Sure, you’d rather see 1500 trucks and rail cars daily from the states? That oil is not getting there from Canada by land. Imagine lining up for gas 2-3 hrs at a time?!

8137 2018-05-30 11:46:37 GP That area has changed, man, since I went to the local Jesuit high school nearby. My sister works at ATF and mentioned the "NOMA" neighborhood. I said, "WTF is that?" She told me where it was and I LMAOed. Used to be (might still be) one of the more dangerous DC areas.
8138 2018-05-30 11:46:28 Petrol prices decreases 1paisa #achedinaagaye for oil companies.....
8139 2018-05-30 11:46:17 Second  a very less known fact but possibility of a sure shot oil cartel. Oil sector is an oligopoly. And  its easy to tweak rates when giant players are govt companies. Hv researched this topic thoroughly. So thats why we r getting oil on exorbitant prices
8140 2018-05-30 11:46:07 Check out this Abhishek...  For 2018 average crude oil price
8141 2018-05-30 11:46:01 अबे गधे, go to any petrol pump st. & get educated how oil companies changes price on daily basis.
8142 2018-05-30 11:46:01 Canada has over capacity in oil refineries 
As a member of parliament you should know this
8143 2018-05-30 11:45:58 Not use to my oil production coming back through 
8144 2018-05-30 11:45:43 With the initiative of GIZ's Skills in Oil and Gas project, we should all be well prepared to take on these jobs.
8145 2018-05-30 11:45:38 People who are glad about that decision are driving SUV and having no thoughts about the environment and their power to make changes for a futur. The costs of global warming is so much more than the shortime profits of oil.
8146 2018-05-30 11:45:30 Yeh kahe ka ka oil mantri hai, when he cannot do anything. These are useless people who have got accidental power.

8148 2018-05-30 11:45:10 Why is th oil against youtube’s guidelines?

8158 2018-05-30 11:43:40 @dpradhanbjp sir, under your ministry, today's decision by oil company to reduce price by one paisa,is making BJP and moreover PM himself laughing stock
8159 2018-05-30 11:43:40 @narendramodi please cut down taxes on fuel prices, bring it under GST or reduce some exercise duty. The oil barrel price before 2014 was really high but price wasn't so high. So please reduce oil prices. Please Please... The whole india is requesting so please do something
8160 2018-05-30 11:43:40 How is oil companies looting us when govt taxes us heavily? We are OK with price change based crude price but with less tax. Right now govt literally robbing us.
8161 2018-05-30 11:43:33 Ask this so called oil mantri, how many households to whom they gave gas cylinders have got them refilled ? I bet they will not have any data on this.
8162 2018-05-30 11:43:24 Electricity can be made from multiple different sources unlike petrol or diesel which all comes from oil.

8166 2018-05-30 11:43:12 GP I went to my local Irish pub on St. Pats day in orange. I know the owner who is Irish Irish. He tried to toss me and I told him to f*ck off, I'm Catholic and American, and I'll wear what I want, where I want, when I want. Then I bought him a Guinness.
8167 2018-05-30 11:43:11 Brave of you to admit to falling for the Lib-Con false-choice swindle. Just as a historical note, the LPC has been anti-climate science for over 26 years, so there really was no excuse. In 2015, Justin's chief of staff as a Big Oil lobbyist.
8168 2018-05-30 11:42:59 ambien is unbelievably bad medicine; I got fooled into taking it once; not twice;  CBD oil does no harm; so the doctor-clowns will give out ambien all day long like candy, but CBD oil is banned;

8171 2018-05-30 11:42:34 I also learned that the Druze people have a town called Rama & Jesus was anointed by oil from there.
8172 2018-05-30 11:42:33 Which snake oil jerk is this?  Maybe Jesus decided that these fake ministers need to flaunt their wealth to the less fortunate!  Maybe this is the NEW teaching of Christ?  Maybe we just fell asleep and conventional beliefs were replaced with greed hate and lies!
8173 2018-05-30 11:42:31 Arnab gang,
Go to any petrol pump & will see, daily price declaration is displayed after reviewed on daily basis by oil companies
8174 2018-05-30 11:42:22 I don't understand when the government has left its control on fuel, then why do they keep this Oil mantri. What does he do in the ministry ? Will he explain.
8175 2018-05-30 11:42:11 I totally agree with this.I believe it was the end game to own Alberta oil then keep it in the ground. UN agenda 21 2030 and Paris accord all being adhered to by globalist Trudeau. What's in it for him?Look at the Trudeau foundation.  He has been bought and paid for. Just sayin'
8176 2018-05-30 11:42:09 RT LoriShemek: When inflammatory oils high in omega 6 fat, such as vegetable, canola, sunflower and corn oil are cooked over high heat, they release toxic chemicals called aldehydes that have been linked to dementia, cancer, and heart disease.  #inflammation #cancer #dementi…

8195 2018-05-30 11:40:12 I've already had the screen replaced - almost as soon as it came out of the box - it had what looked like oil running under the surface.  It's always something you can never predict
8196 2018-05-30 11:40:07 So if we have all this oil and a pipeline that Trudeau is buying with OUR money. Why are we shipping it to other countries so that they can sell it back to us at a higher rate at the pumps? I must be missing something. 
8197 2018-05-30 11:40:00 Fred C. Koch was a founding member of The John Birch Society. A racist organization. And during WW2 built and operated a oil refinery in Russia. Odd
8198 2018-05-30 11:39:59 Eco-terrorists from within the government and from without both having received financing from US pro and anti-oil interests have undermined the Canadian oil industry and cost Canada far more than $4B yesterday.

おめでとうございます
8200 2018-05-30 11:39:57 GP Man, that place used to be a dive bar. I thought they tore it down to put up an office or something. Maybe it was the building next door. I was prolly drunk, though.
8201 2018-05-30 11:39:53 omg I just gave my ugly ass feet a pedicure and I did my own thigh, calf, and foot massage with lavender oil. I feel like a human again lol I should turn this into a side-hustle. I'm ready for ya, Yami-san. 
8202 2018-05-30 11:39:52 Oil price dropping, petrol price rising. What is going on???
8203 2018-05-30 11:39:47 You could then also consider "Europa im Erdölrausch" from @DanieleGanser which is related to oil and geopolitics
8204 2018-05-30 11:39:37 #EkPaiseCut @PMOIndia @narendramodi time to change your Petrol and Oil Minister. @dpradhanbjp you failed not due to increase but due to your action for the price cut.
8205 2018-05-30 11:39:30 And look how that oil wealth has trickled down to the average Nigerian.
8206 2018-05-30 11:39:15 iyaa soalnya salah satu fungsi almond oil bisa buat rambut sama bulmat.

8207 2018-05-30 11:39:06 Dear bhakteshwarji, what was crude oil price then and now??
8208 2018-05-30 11:39:05 Wow Oil Can Harry’s is still open? That’s awesome it’s been around a long time! 
8209 2018-05-30 11:39:01 HE OIL WILL BE OWNED BY A FEW, FOR THE REST IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL
8210 2018-05-30 11:39:00 Money was flowing since oil boom in Nigeria, still we are struggling to fix infrastructure and poverty in the land but we are getting money from oil. 
Money doesn't make you wealthy. It is how you invest it, what you do with it, and how you make it work for you.
8211 2018-05-30 11:38:55 MOODY'S REDUCES INDIA'S GROWTH FORECAST:
Moody's Investors Service report on Wednesday has cut India's GDP growth forecast to 7.3 per cent in 2018, from previous forecast of 7.5 per cent due to higher oil prices and tighter financial conditions.
8212 2018-05-30 11:38:55 GorT: Yep. Most edge to the Dubliner next door now that we’re not….um….younger.
8213 2018-05-30 11:38:43 Its so pathetic that the USA has painted Russia in bad light and also influenced the EU to hate Russia but the EU only like Russia for her oil and gas regardless of the fact that Russia has a lot of money in the EU and US economy.
8214 2018-05-30 11:38:37 As I'm leaving London in the near future, I'm walking the London Capital Ring route. I'd recommend it.

And if you've ever wondered what happened to all that oil money, you can see for yourself where it's gone.
8215 2018-05-30 11:38:14 Finally made a proper chinese hot oil.  Ended up being nda pedas.
Spicy level is 0.5/10.
8216 2018-05-30 11:38:13 Gaza belongs to Palestine!
If US manage to extract oil from this stolen land ( Golan heights!) the west should refuse to buy it!!
Handling stollen property carry’s a heavy penalty!
How much longer can we turn a blind eye to the outrages committed by Israel?
8217 2018-05-30 11:38:08 We need to stand together and boycott Middle East oil that we buy!! They’re using the money to commit terrorism #stopsupplyingME
8218 2018-05-30 11:37:58 @KenyaPower_Care Send your team to check out a transformer near National Oil (Pipeline-Embakasi) which has since caused a blackout from noon.

Please act swiftly.
8219 2018-05-30 11:37:52 Just realized last time I rode I put a clean filter on and forgot to oil it 
8220 2018-05-30 11:37:45 You don't need anointing oil to know this is not the real CS account.
8221 2018-05-30 11:37:41 Priyanka , if you save one paisa a litre and your daily consumption of oil is 10 litre, then you will be able to save a whopping INR 730!! Amazing!!!!
8222 2018-05-30 11:37:36 Another political Super Exclusive. TIMES NOW to confront Oil Mantri @dpradhanbjp.

8223 2018-05-30 11:37:32 Ruff Stuff scrub is a brilliant daily exfoliator especially for your feet this time of year. Leaves them cool, smooth & refreshed as it contains peppermint and coconut oil. Amazing!

8226 2018-05-30 11:37:06 GP Now The Irish Times was a bar. 'Course, could just be my wistful, hazy, half-drunk high school memories. Thought it got torn down, but maybe not. Saw the biggest rat I've ever seen outside that bar. Looked like a small wolf.
8227 2018-05-30 11:37:00 Parents who dress their children in that crap should be horsewhipped.
8228 2018-05-30 11:36:42 Shit I meant rice bran oil lol. Damn autocorrect
8229 2018-05-30 11:36:38 Sir what about the crude oil prices ruling in international market then and now?
8230 2018-05-30 11:36:33 Just got diesel for the car and realized why oil is called liquid gold 
#FuelPriceHike #BharatBachao

8233 2018-05-30 11:36:15 Moody's slashes India's growth forecast in 2018 to 7.3% citing higher oil prices, tighter financial conditions.

8235 2018-05-30 11:36:01 Instead of making useful suggestions to reduce dependence on oil, especially when international crude prices rise, every Tom Dick and Harry is getting sadistic pleasure in criticising the Government!"1 Paisa"
8236 2018-05-30 11:35:59 Have you ever put coconut oil in your hair and it drips into your eyes
8237 2018-05-30 11:35:57 Aaaaaah....bwana handcheque,did u resign coz of Youth fund,Mollases,Triton Oil,Mumias Sugar besides many othr scandals hanging on your neck?
8238 2018-05-30 11:35:43 The price of oil dropped.  That is not a failure on the part of JT.  Keep preaching to your trumpsters while you burn the dumpsters.
8239 2018-05-30 11:35:22 우리 동양인이라 안 죽음
8240 2018-05-30 11:35:13 The left/green can be as delusional as rabid right without the racism.  Oh JT just like Harper, cause he doesn't make decision we want,  we'll ignore the giant list of good work for FN lpc have done, because of oil that would make it to coast anyway, but this way safer.
8241 2018-05-30 11:35:08 Oil Minister Zanganeh: We have plans to sell our crude if #US imposes new sanctions on #Iran's energy sector, but we will not reveal them bcz #Trump administration will plot against our plans. #oil
8242 2018-05-30 11:35:04 Gowdy has talked a lot but deliverered nada
8243 2018-05-30 11:34:57 That's it, hide from the truth. How much you paying for gas?  Probably a dollar more than last year.  Oh boy, can't you feel the prosperity?  I bet the oil companies do! Billionaires like donnie.
8244 2018-05-30 11:34:50 I added it, bc it includes a well written chapter on oil and democracy in the Middle East. The author's different perspective (as a Religionswissenschaftler) is complementary to the other sources.
8245 2018-05-30 11:34:47 Oh. Yessssssssssss
8246 2018-05-30 11:34:39 And niggas will spend 50 on some diluted oil in a vaporizer but not on some fire shatter

8250 2018-05-30 11:33:56 Tarantino Tuesday slashed by Whip it Wednesday, small caps popping up, select individual small caps were green yesterday and today. Nailed it. Nailed oil nine ways to sunday along with related energy names, no reentries for now, too soon. What U doing?
8251 2018-05-30 11:33:49 Oh God yes! A friend saw him at Blockbuster in Honolulu during his Magnum days. He saw her staring - she couldn't help herself! He smiled, went to her & introduced himself, "Hi, I'm Tom Selleck, what's your name?" So nice!
8252 2018-05-30 11:33:37 Do you know that the Energy Sector Levies introduced by the visionary NDC generate far more revenue than the Oil revenues? On average,  oil revenue is about $600m annually,  Energy Sector Levies generate about GHS3.7b in 2017.

8257 2018-05-30 11:33:18 The problem with this is sadly it is totally accurate. Our Central Federal government are beholden to their donors, the coal oil gas and mining lobbies!

8260 2018-05-30 11:32:53 Who said crude oil price was low???Its was very much high due to US withdrawal of iran deal.....Which political information you have to comment on PM Modi.....
8261 2018-05-30 11:32:48 the other way is to apply products to your eye brows such as:
~Almond Oil 
~Olive Oil
~Face oil 
~Vaseline
~Aloe Vera 
~Coconut Oil 
~Coconut Milk

8269 2018-05-30 11:31:25 Perhaps someone cleverer than me can explain why #petrolprices have rocketed by as much as 10p a litre when the price of a barrel of oil has plummeted? #FuelPrices is it because it's half term????
8270 2018-05-30 11:31:23 I was thinking of a tube around pipeline, if it leaks, oil product stays inside tube sleeve cover. Also protects pipeline from getting damaged, reduces leaks as well! Use all plastic to be cleaned from land and sea!

8279 2018-05-30 11:29:12 You pay for your EV’s with the money you get from selling oil. I never insisted you obtain your energy through oil only the discounted EV.

8287 2018-05-30 11:28:37 For 19 days before the Karnataka Elections, the fuel Prices were kept unchanged.Then suddenly for 16 straight days there have been increase, everyday.  Finally after world Crude Oil prices reduced by 5$ per Barrel,they reduced, yesterday !! BY 1 PAISE !! Wah,BJP leadership!! Wah
8288 2018-05-30 11:28:33 3. That Buhari inherited a weak, dying, and recessing economy is as clear as day. In 2013/14, Finance minister ushered us to “austerity” amid crashing oil prices, dwindling revenue, & falling Naira.
8289 2018-05-30 11:28:26 ITS A HUGE RELIEF AFTER 16 DAYS WE MUST THANK OIL COMPANIES AND CELEBRATE ON THIS OCCASION -
8290 2018-05-30 11:28:05 @flyscoot are supplements containing liquid allowed in carry-on baggage? or must they be checked in? eg. a container of 400 capsules of fish oil, 1g each

8313 2018-05-30 11:24:35 Real cost of producing must be charged for petroleum products. No free lunches. Unlike congress- which imported crude on loan and never paid it, present govt repaid loan to gulf countries.

8319 2018-05-30 11:24:10 Sir you changed the question from oil price to everything.
8320 2018-05-30 11:24:05 NUM 8:8 "Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering." (KJV)
8321 2018-05-30 11:24:03 If I understood it correctly when I’ve been there, Norway doesn’t even bring its own oil and gas ashore to use.  No spill risk to their massive aquaculture program (which their environmental advocacy groups advocate for over traditional fisheries)
8322 2018-05-30 11:23:54 I WILL @ YOU. To agree with you. Even if you don't follow his recipes, the mindset is key. Monday for example, I had some veg that I had leftover from the week/BBQ. A courgette, some asparagus and cherry tomatoes. Chopped them up, tossed in the pan with a little oil and pasta.

8327 2018-05-30 11:22:53 ok. You're talking about retail prices. I'm talking about crude oil prices. But will add that I am still paying almost $1.60 a l here now, in 2012 it was around $1.35.
8328 2018-05-30 11:22:49 My bold prediction based on charts is USD 35 - USD 40 for WTI crude by end of this year, I know a lot of oil bulls will not like this , but  count me also as a long term oil bull when I say this.

8330 2018-05-30 11:22:32 Kerala govt’s plan to cut state tax to reduce oil price is neither economically sound nor politically wise. Minuscule cut will soon get eaten up when oil cos drive prices up. People know who are real culprits. Why play with fragile state finances w/o any political dividend?

1.About 20 states are ruled by NDA. What is causing the delay in bringing Oil under GST?
2.Who is going to take the loss in revenue when prices are reduced under GST?Centre or the state?
3. How do you plan to compensate for the loss of that revenue?

8410 2018-05-30 11:11:28 Yup. Patrol prices are stable since a while, but increase is expected. $$ increased almost 15Rs so it has impact on oil prices
but they r doing wrong actually, if the caretaker or new govt will decrease the prices, they earn some repu, but if they don't the culprit will be noon.
8411 2018-05-30 11:11:21 • Eat less fats, sugars and salts
• Carry around oil blotting sheets
• Only use toner twice a week 
• Try not to use foundation too often
• Try using Tea-Tree products (the body shop has some good stuff)
• Use a cleanser that contains salicylic acid morning and night
8412 2018-05-30 11:11:14 It’s probably more than “twice as dirty as conventional oil” from an ecological stand point. The water consumption alone, ignoring the pristine forest being ripped up, would make it one of the dirtiest. Then there’s extraction emissions and transport emissions; chemicals...

8428 2018-05-30 11:09:01 Bringing fuel under GST wont be an easy task. It might lead to having a new GST rate for petrol and diesel, or a new cess because states do not get a share from the compensation cess levied over 28% now. Also if oil prices rise, they will have to mull rate cuts frequently.

8465 2018-05-30 11:03:42 A 'historic' decision taken today with full support of the Feku Gobarment.
Oil prices were reduced by ONE paisa. Not Re. 1,,,but Re.0.1,,,
Never before since independence has this been done....Nehru should be blamed for this insult on Indians.
8466 2018-05-30 11:03:34 Energy moves the world, you have seen oil prices rise and fall

You are seriously going to stan for an oil pipeline and attack those defending their environment? I can't say I am surprised.

8472 2018-05-30 11:02:43 Yes, supply / demand match is a difficult concept for some. They’d prefer to shut down the oil sands (which accomplishes nothing for the environment), and rely on Saudi Arabia and the US.

8479 2018-05-30 11:01:14 It's a fallacious notion that Economic growth gets hampered by high fuel prices, due to increase in transportation cost. Most of Economist gets baffled,  if Oil Prices are increased slightly and starts crying hoarse and claimed that due increase in Oil prices. (1/4)

8495 2018-05-30 10:59:12 God blessed the South with Crude Oil!

Knowing that the Foolani will be blood thirsty and violent, God did not give them oil.

Again this shows that the Foolani live off the South as parasites

8499 2018-05-30 10:58:45 How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity! It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down on the collar of his robe.

8509 2018-05-30 10:55:53 Thank heavens. This time round, you have given credit to the Government for “reducing” petrol price. Usually when the price rises it is the govt to be blamed and when it is cut, it is the oil companies that get the credit.

8519 2018-05-30 10:55:01 Looking forward to you exposing "internal documents" showing the "real reason" Obama Admin reserved such a huge landmass in the first place.   I wonder if oil and gas had anything to do with it.
8520 2018-05-30 10:55:00 You know. No medical approval on a lot. But its oil everything
8521 2018-05-30 10:54:26 The article says they’ll most likely discuss Norway’s export of oil and gas to UK. UK being Norway’s most important trading partner.
8522 2018-05-30 10:54:26 So answer 1 question are we still getting oil from them?
8523 2018-05-30 10:54:08 You are right but in the face of an oil price crisis @NDP should have frozen spending but they believe in solving a financial crisis with more spending and this is what o believe is very irresponsible
8524 2018-05-30 10:53:52 @Coopbankenya ATM at Oil Libya near ABC consistently out of service or lacking money. You need to address this. 
8525 2018-05-30 10:53:51 And by the way the 1st all company in America was standard oil

You need a h*** of a lot more education before you even begin to talk about this subject

Plus get rid of everything in your life that you use or have that associates with oil or fossil fuels 

You will have nothing
8526 2018-05-30 10:53:01 Please stop talking about Modiji!!! Pl.look back !! The Indian oil companies were making mokery on your ministry!!Take drastic measures to stop it otherwise u will be main person in the downfall of BJP Govt!!!. Awake!!! at least now!!!!

8528 2018-05-30 10:52:43 All was 1st used in China as a fuel goes back to the 4th century BC

O and by the way all these oil sources were all naturally occurring on the surface oil Sources

 So pull your head out of your rectum

Oil it's been in use long before Exxon and Chevron came along

8537 2018-05-30 10:51:18 Horgan doesn’t want the diluent in the pipelines...instead of buying the pipeline why wouldn’t we subsidize a low emission refinery here in the Edmonton area. Jobs for us, no diluent in the lines and higher price for oil when sold refined. More profit...more royalties.
8538 2018-05-30 10:51:00 Haha.i thought they had oil on them
8539 2018-05-30 10:50:57 TBH I think it would be better if it was totally outsourced on a national contract. I know that would not be popular but it would provide value for money. As other companies already have the AOC and do as you say air ambulance or oil rig work etc

8542 2018-05-30 10:50:29 Fun fact of the day: the Government of Norway owns 1.3% of all global stocks. It’s enough to give every Norwegian citizen >$200K. *insert oil emoji*

8591 2018-05-30 10:42:59 Think you need to watch the reality - not the media launches by the Oil & Gas companies. Scotland said "FRACK OFF" and we're determined NEVER to have it on OUR soil. Didn't bode well for the English towns rejecting it - Westminster imposed it regardless.
8592 2018-05-30 10:42:44 The problem we have in port harcourt 1. Our youths are not into entrepreneurial skills.2 we all want to work at ministry sector, oil company 3. And everybody want to feel among as big boys in the town.5 sentimental as a result of ethnic and culture diversity.

8597 2018-05-30 10:42:02 Being a PM when oil is $ 110 a barrel and when it is $40 dollar a barrel is like driving a tractor versus a Lamborghini. So when you are in your comfort zone but srilll won’t pass the benefit to the aam aadmi, what does one say?

8603 2018-05-30 10:41:08 Come on. Government is doing this a lot !! Petroleum authority is doing a lot of sensitization in the oil areas cc @PAU_Uganda @GloriaSebikari
8604 2018-05-30 10:41:03 Petrol price reduced by 1 paise,next see whether Govt/GST council/Oil Ministry/empowered idiots/etc can sit & ensure raise minimum 30 paise, if reduction means reduce as if body makes favour as if they pay from their pocket, communicate transparently, stop fooling, incapable team
8605 2018-05-30 10:40:59 Our energy team publishes a new #AheadOfTheCurve report on Artificial Lift, technology used to enhance production of aging #oil wells $APY $WFT

8609 2018-05-30 10:40:24 Um. What deregulation case studies are you referring to? genuinely curious. RE smoking, don't get me started on government complicity in that industry's success & longevity. Ditto RE oil industry, the ongoing oil wars, price fixing, the anti-electric car lobbies & legislation...

8611 2018-05-30 10:40:10 I just stay in pub until 2.45. but if Neck Oil or Gamma Ray was on offer, I’d certainly think twice.
8612 2018-05-30 10:40:01 Broccoli Rabe with 1/2 cup Pistachios 3 tablespoon grated cheese, 6 garlic cloves. Quality olive oil to taste.
8613 2018-05-30 10:40:01 Indeed. It is in Vlad's interest to keep things unstable. Peace doesn't work out well for him. Oil process settle and his economy suffers. There's also his personal ego to feed.
8614 2018-05-30 10:39:55 Neck Oil continues to be a media darling IMO because of what it was like 2 years ago and not what it tasted like now.
8615 2018-05-30 10:39:38 The problem is that too much focus is done in the macroeconomic variables as if they show from the thin air

Demography? Technological effects? Oil prices affecting the purchasing power? Productivity?

Spending more money to import the goods and services? Creating jobs outside?
