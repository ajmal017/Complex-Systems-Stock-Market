3 2018-05-08 23:59:40 Yeah maybe. Time will tell but unless oil goes back up drastically they are in tough at those prices.
4 2018-05-08 23:59:39 You obviously live in an alternate reality where the oil supply never runs out. Hard to believe that dinosaurs once roamed the earth.

48 2018-05-08 23:57:31 when weakened, they have to win the population by giving in to the demands and give rights and so on.. when oil gets them filthy rich, their priorities becomes supporting their militias in Syria, Lebonan, ...

It's hard to draw a good picture of how non-democratic Iran is.

52 2018-05-08 23:57:06 Totally willing to pay MORE for gas to get rid of the #OneSided #Iran deal - and in reality the cheap oil has hurt the US more than helped us!  For a family who depends on off shore drilling and American oil for our livelihood, I am thrilled with this!  #NoDeal

54 2018-05-08 23:56:57 Who would that be ... the biggest recipients of Iranian oil are in Asia - the biggest by far is China? You'd do better tracking imports into China - the EU w the biggest stake is Germany (#3 exporter to Iran), who have been nabbed selling nuclear technology throughout the ME.

57 2018-05-08 23:56:45 Iran can still sell oil to our FVEY partners, China and other countries around the world.  The US walked away but they didn’t.  Oil is a fungible commodity...hard to determine origin
58 2018-05-08 23:56:36 I don't know why people try to take their kids to actual decent restaurants. It's hell.
59 2018-05-08 23:56:34 OMG Yes please!! More of this!!
60 2018-05-08 23:56:27 Also Arabian countries are upset because we are producing so much it's dropped the cost of oil so they have reduced their output to force the prices up again

62 2018-05-08 23:56:12 actually.gas prices have been down. oil just went to 70 a barrel. it has to be at least 60 when they start drilling. the added tax your home state places on your gas is the problem not feds. balance your budget.
63 2018-05-08 23:56:10 イケメンだからね
64 2018-05-08 23:56:07 Russia doesn’t need their oil.

66 2018-05-08 23:55:53 Iran is the only oil producing country without a refinery to produce gasoline. So they pump oil, export oil and then import gasoline. Let that sink in. Now explain why I should fear these mud hut dwelling cave men.
67 2018-05-08 23:55:46 Tapered Marker, Oil paint but when in doubt Wire Brush
68 2018-05-08 23:55:44 Pretty much. Pushes greater incentive for Iran to start selling oil in yuan denominated contracts. 

@LukeGromen is probably going to have a lot to say about it over the next few days. Worth a follow if you’re curious.

75 2018-05-08 23:54:03 Hope the USA does not expect anyone to help them, he screwed his allies and wants Iran oil
76 2018-05-08 23:53:59 Iran's JCPOA by Obama and P5+1 to lighten sanction on regime. Iran was able to regain asset worth $100,000 billion frozen abroad while sell oil for goods. During sanction Iran lost more than $100,000 billion can't sell oil. Theocracy Iran flawed splurging money on terrorists.
77 2018-05-08 23:53:59 Your best bet for foundation matching is to go to a store like sephora or a department store counter. The phrases you want are “Light coverage” “can be applied with fingers” and either “oil based” or “water based”. IF you have super sensitive skin, CoverFX is your best bet.
78 2018-05-08 23:53:52 #wti guess some wanted cheap oil to scoop hence the fake news.
79 2018-05-08 23:53:35 Iran was capabale of making nuclear weapons in 2004. If they wanted to today they absolutely could. The deal we had was stopping them from accomplishing that. Now they could start tomorrow, what will sanctions do? They’ll just sell the oil to Russia

81 2018-05-08 23:53:12 so the entire world alrdy knew trump was gon' pull the deal and it wouldn't have much impact on iran's output yet still deeply believe this oil + story?
82 2018-05-08 23:53:08 Obama’s plan load of cash was small compared to all the other cash released to them, along with money their getting from oil and other goods. And there are still locations we cannot get into.  #IranDeal
83 2018-05-08 23:53:07 US talks to oil producers about increasing output...
84 2018-05-08 23:53:05 A couple of things I see happening with 45s latest decision:

1. Gas prices fluctuate pretty terribly 
2. US invasion of Iran for oil, or potential secret deal
3. War is provoked because Iran's economy is hurt and can't sell oil.

Either way, that was a dumb decision

90 2018-05-08 23:52:07 I would gather that Trump did this for Russia.  He puts a big wedge between America and our European applies, increases the oil price for Russia, and gives Russia more leverage and influence in the Middle East.  He sold out this country for a few million  dollars from Russia.

94 2018-05-08 23:51:50 Interesting that no one has commented on EU reliance on Iranian oil as factor to keep “the deal” going.
95 2018-05-08 23:51:44 Absurd. Would the US force a domestic prod cut to support global oil prices, to benefit KSA/RU, or any other oil prod economy? Aw hellllll no! This is political cover. If you can name the deal, you can name the players. Don't name the players, means there is no deal. Get real.

avocado oil vs olive oil —

106 2018-05-08 23:50:26 Perth is best value in the country. Lots of projects in next 5 years will rise house prices. Oil and Gas and mining. Mining will be big again.
107 2018-05-08 23:50:19 I think it has something to do with where they placed the oil and flavoring in the bag
108 2018-05-08 23:50:15 Anybody notice that oil prices are rising?
109 2018-05-08 23:49:59 We should send him some cuticle oil. 
110 2018-05-08 23:49:53 Hmmm, destabilize the middle east and drive up oil prices and oil company profits. Right out of the Dick Cheney playbook.
111 2018-05-08 23:49:50 maybe their plan is putin’s plan to invade & overtake iran.

putin doesn’t just want to rebuild russia—he wants to build a russian empire. he’s willing to murder his own people for power.

he invaded georgia, now armenia politically.

putin wants iran’s  ports, oil & pipeline.

121 2018-05-08 23:48:25 You just helped your buddy putin sell more oil to the EU- assuming of course the EU complies with your sanctions-perhaps you’ll be begging to get back in the “deal” when the other countries negotiate a new deal with Iran - just like you tried to do with the TPP - how’d that go ?
122 2018-05-08 23:48:23 All the money seized was from iranian oil sales, maybe they would have used the funds to fund shady organizations, but it was theirs. So the correct action would have been, not to buy their oil.

126 2018-05-08 23:47:53 While your making up lies our oil prices will hit the roof...such a moron in my opinion
127 2018-05-08 23:47:47 Thanks Mr. President... exiting the Iran deal and putting huge sanctions on them is going to push oil, and therefore gas prices at the pump, higher. And they're already going up since OPEC pulled back production. And yet you and the GOP don't want to get off of oil.
128 2018-05-08 23:47:46 Okay you are an idiot Russia is profiting from Iran deal, they are in oil business and Russia selling arms to them . They are partners in Syria . Duh

130 2018-05-08 23:47:09 STEP 1: ECONOMIC--> 
The Saudi economy is reliant on it's oil. In order to strengthen the economy, Saudi Arabic must begin to invest in some of their other natural resources, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, chromium, manganese, tungsten, lead, tin, aluminum, and iron.

141 2018-05-08 23:45:53 A part from maintaining strategic oil reserves, India may pursue crude oil  diplomacy with Iran. Energy independence is more important. Right time to trade crude oil with #Indian #Rupee ...can help at sudden crude oil price shocks.

144 2018-05-08 23:45:15 I need an oil change

146 2018-05-08 23:45:04 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
147 2018-05-08 23:44:57 With sanctions on Iran’s oil, Russian oil just became much more valuable!  @realDonaldTrump is that why you violated the agreement?
148 2018-05-08 23:44:50 Ms Joan, you have to try them tossed in olive oil and garlic roasted the taste is amazing. You must have ate them plain?
149 2018-05-08 23:44:48 I have been saying this for months. Oil is up because it makesPutin money andit kills the middle/ lower incomes
150 2018-05-08 23:44:46 They aren’t oil heavy, OPEC subsidizes everything pretty much. Petroleum-dollar and all that jazz.

I’m for a new approach.
151 2018-05-08 23:44:45 Bankers who funded shale dropped it -- that may have a political tinge. China printing $1T in 1H2016 and buying oil with some of it raised the price. I think China was just stocking up on a bargain. I would be happy to know better than these guesses.
152 2018-05-08 23:44:43 Sorry Breaking the treaty today without any plan only succeeded in splitting our alliances and strengthen Russia who will benefit from higher oil prices.  Russia wins big time while Trump diminishes USA!  Who will trust Trump!  Only fools!  Trump assist to Putin today who won big
153 2018-05-08 23:44:35 Lavender oil.
154 2018-05-08 23:44:34 Facts written by the oil companies and their underwriters for their own use.  Keep fooling yourself and pretending that rejecting science and engineering makes you an economic conservative.  That's what Energy in Depth is for.
155 2018-05-08 23:44:32 Bad business idea #523: start a cbd oil line called “CBDBs”, market it to aging punks.
156 2018-05-08 23:44:16 Iran only provides 1000 b/d in oil production.  Don’t believe the hype and the fear that the left is peddling about the strategic oil reserves running low or running completely out.
157 2018-05-08 23:43:55 Current level of laziness: I ran out of olive oil so I'm cooking dinner with butter.
158 2018-05-08 23:43:45 While #Australia, #GovernedByIdiots continues to let multinationals SELL OUR resources, like #oil and #gas, for THEIR profit, overseas, while STILL shifting THEIR #debts here, to avoid paying #tax, AND our #Government hunts US for income!

163 2018-05-08 23:43:28 I just smelled coconut oil for the first time and somehow I’m shocked by how much it smells like coconuts..... like obviously????
164 2018-05-08 23:43:23 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
165 2018-05-08 23:43:23 Netanyahu is a liar.  He would fight iran to the last drop of American blood.  This is about oil and defense contracts.  How much did lobbyists pay you?
166 2018-05-08 23:43:11 Like pancakes or a waffle maybe. But anything with hot oil? NAHHHHH
167 2018-05-08 23:42:53 Trumps withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal is a multi-billion dollar gift to the oil companies, resulting in higher gas prices. The avg American gets screwed again.
168 2018-05-08 23:42:50 Our 1st cat got into some motor oil once, it got all over her, and in her, nearly killed her. Thanks to vet she survived & recovered fully, but she lost all the fur on her belly & legs. Quite the sight, a naked cat. It took months to grow back.

These Separatists are the same snake oil salesmen who got found out, resulting in them winning just over 1,600,000 of the near 4,300,000 votes available on 18\9\14.
173 2018-05-08 23:42:06 So destabilizing the region and hanging our allies out to dry is ok as long as it is good for the oil industry
174 2018-05-08 23:41:58 Remember how leaving the Iran deal would crash markets and send oil higher? Well, oil fell $2 and stocks were flat.

Liberals were wrong AGAIN
175 2018-05-08 23:41:57 I say margarine, it's technically a low fat vegetable oil based spread. Still, it's butter substitute.
176 2018-05-08 23:41:55 @repbobBishop This is one American who demands you have a hearing for HR 731!  We don’t want any new oil lease sales off the coast of beautiful Santa Barbara, CA.  #HR731
177 2018-05-08 23:41:41 May be good for oil companies (higher oil prices) but bad for consumers (higher gas prices).  Are you more concerned about oil companies or consumers?  I’ll wait!

182 2018-05-08 23:41:16 This is so scathingly accurate, I need ointment on the burns. Some snake oil balm ought to do...
183 2018-05-08 23:41:04 Ight so boom, deep condition weekly with heat for at least 30 mins and you can even dc over night & for daily moisture pick a method that works for you like the L.C.O method (liquid, cream, and oil) liquid = water, cream = leave in conditioner, and oil = seal in all the moisture.
184 2018-05-08 23:40:58 This is rubbish. The threat to world peace centres in Saudi Arabia who funded & helped Sisi Coup in Egypt & continue to fund terror grps in the interest of oil pipelined thru Syria. Then there's Turkey to add. Then USA then Israel. Way b4 "world peace" being threatened by #Iran.

190 2018-05-08 23:40:29 Big hip on commodities trading prices! But since the EPA is virtually nonexistent we will just tap into our oil reserves, drill off shore more, and drill in Alaska! Donald’s approval rating cannot withstand any economic turmoil.
191 2018-05-08 23:40:27 I think I’m older than you, and I grew up with spreadable margarine, which is why I use only butter or olive oil now.
192 2018-05-08 23:40:25 Crude Oil remains a long $CL_F. Buying dips like today should continue to 80 in WTI
193 2018-05-08 23:40:23 I remember not that long ago hearing we would never see oil above $40 a barrel. It’s been over $60 for a while now.

200 2018-05-08 23:39:43 Not only bec of Obama but DT wants to help Russia with their economy; higher oil prices; DT wants to go to war with Iran to take the oil and help the UEA to be the only ones to produce oil in the region after the wars devastated Syria and Iraq; DT helps Israel to expand; zionism.

202 2018-05-08 23:39:21 I’m happy. Price of oil will boom; you’re well aware of this. This chess move helps us in Canada, also Saudi & Russia.
203 2018-05-08 23:39:19 2/2. Neither can I! I have epilepsy and could legally obtain and possess CBD oil instead of the expensive and toxic drugs I take, but what’s the point? I can’t buy it in GA thanks to you and the back-woods GA legislature. Stop patting yourselves on the back until it’s fixed.
204 2018-05-08 23:39:11 @Blestxcellence where’s ya oil? My paper needs a touch 
205 2018-05-08 23:38:58 Yeah where do you get off using your right to free choice to remove your personal transportation expenses from the gross oil spend? Oil sellers only ever jack up the prices when they absolutely have to and you're forcing their hand, freeloader!

207 2018-05-08 23:38:43 Thanks for the link but I am aware of how politically motivated decisions could affect crude oil prices. After all, my spouse and I had worked in Shell for a while and in one of the biggest engineering companies in the world. So we have an idea. But I appreciate it!

209 2018-05-08 23:38:23 Oil prices fell as Trump  announced the U.S. would exit the Iran nuke deal and reimpose sanctions.
West Texas Intermediate Crude fell 1.6 percent on the Brent Crude, the international standard, fell 0.71 percent. In the futures market, oil for June delivery declined 1.43 percent.

211 2018-05-08 23:38:12 And if you really think you were fighting defending what our country stands for you are being deluded. You were fighting for oil and the banking systems and all sorts of things that have nothing to do with our values! Believe what you want, doesn't make it true!

213 2018-05-08 23:38:09 Coming out of this deal will not help us or keep us safer. The price of oil will go up.
214 2018-05-08 23:38:05 Sad to see someone intelligent enough to obtain a Ph.D and still remain narrow-minded. I don't know about Magic Water but I know that I've had no pain from arthritis in my wrist & foot for years and the orthopedist acknowledges the Sweet Birch oil I use actually fucking works.
215 2018-05-08 23:38:02 Putin: Deals of give us back Alaska. It's not fair. We didn't know about the oil

Live in OK but currently on an oil platform in ocean or in western Africa. I love giving them geography quizzes as soon as I know they're not from the US. 
223 2018-05-08 23:36:34 I forgot to get my oil changed
224 2018-05-08 23:36:28 I think Trump promised Exxon and other oil companies he'd have gas past $4.00 a gallon asap. Iran stupidity may result in way higher gasoline prices-just like Iraq war helped Bush/Chaney keep their pledge to reward oil companies.#NOWAR

226 2018-05-08 23:36:17 And Mossadegh's greatest crime?  Taking back the Iranian oil fields from British control (since 1913).  What maniac thinks ppl should control their own country's natural resources?  Wow! (5)
227 2018-05-08 23:36:17 Add $oil to that list
228 2018-05-08 23:36:11 The oil revenue must be spent for the people by genuine Iranian leaders not few chosen by Guardian Council.
229 2018-05-08 23:36:08 Sen Flake..u r right. Not a wise move 
To pull the U S out of Iran.  Oil. War. Nuclear. Other countries. He doesn’t care as It’s all about T ‘s hate for Blacks. Mostly Obama.
230 2018-05-08 23:36:05 Well you will be rememberd as the worst american president of all ,you are leading the world and the middle east to an unnesessary war just to get their mony and oil , but aaah wharever , arabs are beyond stupid they follows you , so they deserve this anyways .
231 2018-05-08 23:36:04 A century from now when the Earth runs out of oil future generations will ask “did they really need so many Funko Pop figures in 2018?”
232 2018-05-08 23:36:01 Agree. Sad it could throw the region to another civil war. Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran had nothing to do with Sep 11. The real sancturies of Salafi fanaticism and global terror ideologues in Saudi Arabia continue to flourish as west has done dirty deals with them for oil security
233 2018-05-08 23:35:56 If gas prices go up due to an "artificial gas crisis" due to the awesome withdrawal of the Iran Deal. President Trump should freeze gas prices. We have an abundance of oil in the US & our allies. We don't need Iran & never did. Democrats are creating fake news to drive prices up.

238 2018-05-08 23:35:39 Even war for oil is better than this.

240 2018-05-08 23:35:32 Still don't like policies that can indirectly help the oil cartel and their killing machine of well financed proxy wars (or private mercenaries).
241 2018-05-08 23:35:28 Drop dead @PPFA #Scheiderman
242 2018-05-08 23:35:23 Projections of sharp oil price increases are likely overblown. Iran sold its oil during the prior run of sanctions at a discount to many willing buyers.  Evidence: world oil price barely budged when sanctions were lifted.
243 2018-05-08 23:35:15 When Americans start paying much higher prices for gas, they can than dumb ass donny. Other countries should continue to buy Iranian oil.
244 2018-05-08 23:35:10  just used #WholeBlends Coconut Oil shampoo and conditioner for the first time last night, and I love it! My hair is so soft and no frizz in sight #miracle  @GarnierCAN
245 2018-05-08 23:34:58 Absolutely, plus it keeps oil costs down for them. They're pretty fast and loose with sending American dollars to Iran....
246 2018-05-08 23:34:34 “Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have between 90-180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The oil sanctions will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran.”

WTF 
247 2018-05-08 23:34:29 How about the coal companies, oil companies and gas companies....and everything that results from their usage
248 2018-05-08 23:34:18 Yes Fuck the Obama era weakness
249 2018-05-08 23:34:06 “If you stay to close with me I’ll do your oil change” well Fuc victor jokes on you cause I know how to do my own oil change lol
250 2018-05-08 23:34:06 Nah, the price will be tempered by increased US oil production. Drill baby drill!
251 2018-05-08 23:33:58 Aligned with Putin and Qatar and Saudis. (Higher oil prices.)
Hankers to use nukes.
252 2018-05-08 23:33:57 Also as a bonus to the reversion to the 2015 sanctions, Iranian oil goes off the free market making Putin/Russian oil worth more $$. #Cult45 #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
253 2018-05-08 23:33:56 Cleaned out my fryer and the bottle of oil i had wasn't enough soooo i guess no fries for me 
254 2018-05-08 23:33:54 #1 Another Obama policy reversed. #2 Once Iran is eliminated from the global oil market, amerikkka's oil barons can get the price of a barrel of sweet, crude back above  $100.00. Pretty simple, actually.
255 2018-05-08 23:33:54 Is it ok to dump my used oil in the ditch? #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
256 2018-05-08 23:33:39 definitely i usually use sugar and coconut oil its pretty good but i think ill try the toothbrush
257 2018-05-08 23:33:32 Omg when I get home I’m going to send you this coconut oil that works wonders it’s not even funny...
258 2018-05-08 23:33:20 Oil price spiking costing US citizens $$$ and Boeing orders impacted costing US jobs.

259 2018-05-08 23:33:16 I’m going to try the Ocrevus in a month or 2 IF  approved.I’ve been using CBD oil for the past year and I’m getting worse by the second. I hope that you get your ms meds back. 5 months or 5 days, with ms it’s all the same unfortunately.#FuckMS
260 2018-05-08 23:33:14 see one country bullying all these countries...wow! no steel talk no more, now it’s iran perhaps the only oil competition in the mid-east. R.Mueller’s interview coming that’s why all these.
261 2018-05-08 23:33:09 hfgfdgg tbh the elf bb cream is actually pretty nice with concealer as long as u set it w a powder; ive also been applying pure avocado oil i think its been helping!!
262 2018-05-08 23:33:08 also i get to see my grandad tomorrow and he started using cbd oil so i get to see if it works for his parkinsons and im so excited
263 2018-05-08 23:33:03 Oil is 68$ / bbl + increasing federal/provincial tax & carbon tax = expensive gas.. #nocarbontax #KillTheCarbonTax
264 2018-05-08 23:33:00 So how are you personally making money from this?  What’s the angle? Paid off by big oil somehow for restricting the supply from Iran to the US and driving up the price perhaps?
265 2018-05-08 23:32:59 Californians are already taxed to death on gas. They know most CA Democrats and the CA students from K-12, even higher ed, don't understand math. California steals money at the pump from sales tax to excise taxes and most Californians think it's the oil companies overcharging.
266 2018-05-08 23:32:53 If you’re in pain, clove oil will help a LOT. I had double dry sockets after mine and they packed the holes with crushed cloves. Instant relief.
267 2018-05-08 23:32:30 Is it pronounced oil or oil?
268 2018-05-08 23:32:30 Couple issues.  They weren't really a liberal economy like north america or europe. and everything in the country was backed by petro.  The problems that occurred weren't because of Socialism, it was because of the economy. When oil tanked, so did the country.
269 2018-05-08 23:32:20 It's convenient that America/Trump only started caring about what's going on in Iran the moment Iran start thinking about trading oil in currencies that aren't the dollar. Happened several times in US history now.
270 2018-05-08 23:32:13 If it isn’t sanctioned in any way, shape, or form, there must be some reason for that. Possibly because most oil comes from Saudi Arabia, and such sanctions might damage economies. I try not to take things at face value lol, I don’t like either country, however
271 2018-05-08 23:32:12 So let's see, we cut a deal with allies to not buy oil from Iran, but then we send them billions in cash?  Staying in this deal helps who, how?  If your ideas made reasonable sense to me, perhaps I could find some reason to support you, but THEY NEVER MAKE SENSE!!!
272 2018-05-08 23:32:11 I’m afraid so, to do it correctly. If you don’t want to drop some coin on it now, may I suggest you do a temp solution. You could match stain and put down that along with oil base poly, the goal here is to protect that raw oak from further soiling.
273 2018-05-08 23:32:09 Gas & oil  prices way up @realDonaldTrump Bad Job.
274 2018-05-08 23:32:05 Russia is overjoyed. Oil prices up. Maybe you don't know much about Russia.
275 2018-05-08 23:31:55 Iran will still deal with China, doesn’t most of Iran’s oil go there, meaning no bearing to oil market?
276 2018-05-08 23:31:52 I saw my first and today. Try using peppermint essential oil or cinnamon essential oil as a deterent. #rentawife #lifehacks
277 2018-05-08 23:31:49 What was the late President John Evans Atta Mills’ contribution to Ghana’s oil discovery for the 
Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel (FPSO), to be named after him ? Mercies
278 2018-05-08 23:31:48 Unbelievable. By the time  we we build the pipelines, if we ever do, oil will be selling at $10 a barrel, alternative energy will be the norm and Canada will be in a debt spiral
279 2018-05-08 23:31:24 Get more money from his oil exec cronies.  With that tax cut they can funnel more his way......

282 2018-05-08 23:31:18 Tillerson has Trump on speed dial so up goes the price of oil.
283 2018-05-08 23:31:09 Iran's exports of oil to China, Europe and other countries will  decline later this year and into 2019 if the United States can enforce  President Donald Trump's decision to reimpose the "highest level" of  economic sanctions targeting oil trade with Iran.
284 2018-05-08 23:31:07 Oil companies and traders Beware; Getting ready to file an anti trust and price fixing law suit.
285 2018-05-08 23:31:06 Great @envirorundc with @AmyAHarder of @Axios. Need to have uncomfortable convos eg talk climate with oil co’s- if it’s not uncomfortable, why bother?
286 2018-05-08 23:30:57 That’s not body oil. It’s the slime he always secretes from every pore on his body.
287 2018-05-08 23:30:47 Worst kitchen splash:  hot oil. Second worst, scalding tomato sauce.  I'm 2/2 today.
288 2018-05-08 23:30:46 The oil patch is starting to take off again. ...70$ a barrel almost. Try to get your foot in the door of the oil industry, plumbing or electrical those last 2 are badly in need of helpers/apprentice
289 2018-05-08 23:30:33 Not cripple Iran create a regime who can handle the riches from oil and invest it correctly in the people.

292 2018-05-08 23:30:25 Trump's disastrous dissolution of the Iran deal does two things-- it weakens NATO, and it will drive up oil prices. Now, let's see, what Russian despot would love to see both these things happen? Here's another clue -- this Russian has a puppet in the White House.
293 2018-05-08 23:30:23 first time getting an oil change at @Honda of Escondido
294 2018-05-08 23:30:06 bout to start drillin for oil in my backyard 
295 2018-05-08 23:30:06 Ah, the easiest way to get the usual Republican chaos to run up the price of oil for the lobbyists and the Middle East allies.
296 2018-05-08 23:30:04 Meanwhile, we continue to pour money into Saudi Arabian oil, from which most of the 9/11 attackers originated...
297 2018-05-08 23:30:03 Russia relies on oil- that’s the whole deal.

299 2018-05-08 23:30:01 I got a blister from hot oil that popped while cooking yesterday
300 2018-05-08 23:29:50 In view of the instability of the #US at the moment, how big a job would it be for the world to stop trading oil in US$, or could it even be done?
301 2018-05-08 23:29:49 But Dutch/BP already own Persian oil. Right? 

Trump prob gets on fine w House of Orange 
302 2018-05-08 23:29:39 There was some leftover cake in the fridge but I really wanted some cream to go with it but there was no butter to make cream so I just continuously stirred a cup of milk with coconut oil in it hoping it would thicken, I gave up and just poured it on the cake... never again...
303 2018-05-08 23:29:24 it does nothing to our pocket the oil is controlled by opec not Iran.

306 2018-05-08 23:29:01 If Trudeau cared about our oil or energy sector at all he wouldn't be paying anti oil groups and protesters to shut down our pipelines! Report on that!
307 2018-05-08 23:28:57 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
308 2018-05-08 23:28:55 すきだわ
309 2018-05-08 23:28:53 Ok...thanks
310 2018-05-08 23:28:53 Making dinner and I just got mad that I had to use butter because I ran out of olive oil... but then after I scooped the butter I automatically licked the spoon... I felt like Marchand with no damn self control.
311 2018-05-08 23:28:49 US, CANADA, ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND, IRELAND AND SWEDEN!! COMING TO YOU!! JOIN THE CBD OIL INDUSTRY FOR FREE!! LET ME KNOW IF I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT!!
312 2018-05-08 23:28:45 This is horrifying. The destruction of the natural world, just to satisfy our insatiable appetite for cheap oil is a price we simply cannot pay.

These beautiful creatures are already paying a horrific price and so are indigenous peoples. We too will pay the price if we continue.
313 2018-05-08 23:28:40 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

316 2018-05-08 23:28:30 I average $0.00 per year on body oil.  Might spend more if I had a different body.
317 2018-05-08 23:28:28 Gotta go get a dam oil change early af tomorrow morning 
318 2018-05-08 23:28:25 As oil prices rise and the AMERICAN economy feels the effect of the tax cut you “gave” dissipate.  What other sleeve are you going to “give” me from your vest.
319 2018-05-08 23:28:24 Money and oil
320 2018-05-08 23:28:22 Annnnnd there go the oil prices... Up Up and Awaaaay
321 2018-05-08 23:28:22 @realDonaldTrump so 80 oil is our future?  MAKE EXXON MOBIL GREAT AGAIN??...please help America and get prices back to where they were when you took office.

324 2018-05-08 23:28:12 America gets $0 of Iranian oil. Ironically most goes to Russia, then sold off to China. Remember how you screamed about war with NK during “little rocket man”? How did that turn out? Funny, he might get a peace prize... 
325 2018-05-08 23:28:11 引くほど眠い。何だ今日
326 2018-05-08 23:28:09 Yeah I like oil but short term might be quite rough...
327 2018-05-08 23:28:03 Recall we're talking about a guy who used his charity's money to buy a 6 foot oil painting of himself.
328 2018-05-08 23:28:00 I think that was just a bonus. Russia survives in oil and higher prices help them/hurt us. Destabilizing the mid East is just a bonus for Vladdy.
329 2018-05-08 23:27:54 Vitarah oil dripping 
330 2018-05-08 23:27:51 @CNN @MSNBC @nytimes @latimes @washingtonpost @HuffPost @guardian @BuzzFeedNews make no mistake, withdrawing the Iran nuclear deal will drive up oil prices,Putin is smiling all the way 2 the bank,don't 4get the Arabs ; 4 Trump this is about oil,money 4 him and his friends !
331 2018-05-08 23:27:48 The Iranian issue is all about oil, not nuclear threats. Give me a break. We're not all stupid! It's all about money!
332 2018-05-08 23:27:48 #US#companies#n#theDeal "In the wake of the Iran deal, Schlumberger, the Houston-based oil driller, reached preliminary agreements to reënter Iran, which is among the world’s largest oil producers. So did General Electric,& Boeing @JohnCassidy
333 2018-05-08 23:27:47 Cut in halves Sautéed in olive oil with bacon bits & crushed pepper is yummmmm, BUT time consuming to make
334 2018-05-08 23:27:46 Any bets The Trump family and their cronies bought oil futures before today. Follow the money.
335 2018-05-08 23:27:38 I paid to get an oil change twice last year at jiffy lube without knowing my car warranty gives me 2 free oil changes per year at Chevrolet. I’m so stupid. 
336 2018-05-08 23:27:35 I'm not bearish, and I like oil services here for sure.
337 2018-05-08 23:27:34 We’re appeasing Russia. Did you note the spike in oil prices? We also went back on our word.
338 2018-05-08 23:27:34 Yea I put oil, beans, meat, and sofrito cook it up a little then add your rice and water and taste the water make sure it has flavor to your liking then let it cook and put it on low when all the water is almost gone.  That’s it.  I really do 1 1/2 cup of water to 1 cup rice
339 2018-05-08 23:27:28 I wouldn’t put channel stuffing past them, but the only question is where, maybe an oil sheik bro in the Middle East is sitting on a bunch of cars?
340 2018-05-08 23:26:57 still bullish oil?
341 2018-05-08 23:26:53 Seasoned it. Added seasoning to the hot oil in saucepan. Then sauteed 
342 2018-05-08 23:26:50 I need to stop thinking that my essential oil spray is equivalent of washing my clothes.
343 2018-05-08 23:26:40 Not that it's the best indicator of disease, but one of my patients lowered her total cholesterol from 275 to 187 and lost 17.5 lbs since January 25 just with diet and exercise and some basic supplements--multi, vit D, and fish oil
344 2018-05-08 23:26:36 Oil  reserves won’t make any difference. With the price of a barrel of oil U.S. producers and Canada will have the oil drills working 24/7
345 2018-05-08 23:26:29 Putin is also wanting the price of oil to sky rocket, since the vast majority of the Russian economy is based on revenue from oil sales.
346 2018-05-08 23:26:26 US/Israeli government provoking Iran by quitting the deal and attacking Syrian bases. Their hand is weak, however, if Iran plays his right he might end up with S-300 systems in Syria and a bigger economic relationship with Europe to compensate for the oil sanctions. #IranDeal
347 2018-05-08 23:26:16 AND unless your Jeep uses synthetic oil, dealerships usually have an up charge on an oil change!!
348 2018-05-08 23:26:09 Trump keeps making decisions that push up the cost of oil.  One, that makes the profits on US oil better. Since their extraction cost is pretty high.  Two, it makes Russian oil exploration viable for the first time in a few years at least.
349 2018-05-08 23:25:59 No one is talking about climate change on Capitol Hill but in our company it’s all we talk about said an oil exec, says @AmyAHarder at #envirorun
350 2018-05-08 23:25:58 Iran has infilitrated Iraq. Iranian troops are in Syria.  Russia keeps em supplied with weapons. China buys their black market oil.  Tough sanctions is the only option to not kick the can down the road like Obama did.
351 2018-05-08 23:25:46 we got to the oil glut when they used nukes to frack. 
that's how they opened up the Permian Basin again.
but hey, oil companies wouldn't do that right? 
lol
352 2018-05-08 23:25:43 I think my followers are, somehow, influenced by the price of oil.. very worrying and very volatile trend.
353 2018-05-08 23:25:25 Im trying to get into better shape...if I may ask...do you workout for strength or aesthetics?
354 2018-05-08 23:25:25 WOOHOO! HOME BEFORE DARK,  now i can change my oil. And hope all is ok.
355 2018-05-08 23:25:24 Not about oil at all
356 2018-05-08 23:25:23 Dno why I’m expecting bio oil to work overnight
357 2018-05-08 23:25:07 Thank you @herbalclinic for making it easy to get beauty products in refillable containers. I'm so happy that I can refill my Rosehip oil here and not have to buy it for double the price and in a new container each time. Plus no packaging!
358 2018-05-08 23:25:06 I get palm oil is a real and serious issue but it’s in so many things that it would be even more difficult to find food if I started boycotting everything with it. Some vegans just like to pick at everything others do.

361 2018-05-08 23:24:51 Cut the tax scam instead.  Trump and other billionaires and millionaires don't have to pay income taxes.  imagine a Billionaire that does not have to pay income taxes.  He is a snake oil salesman. Wake up Republicans you are being ripped off by the GOP and Trump.

364 2018-05-08 23:24:40 Destabilize the oil market without proof of a violation by Iran.  Who benefits?  Not us, the price of gas will go up.  It will, however, benefit a major Republican donor---the Koch brothers...and Russia.
365 2018-05-08 23:24:29 @FoxNews I hope gas prices go to  $10 a gallon, because nothing want change that Trump is doing unless it hurt white people pockets! Black people used to the struggle and rarely live off credit! Iran going to charge the shit out us for oil. Trump dumb as hell!
366 2018-05-08 23:24:28 My Zelda just had a cancerous tumor removed & its a good chance her other lumps are cancerous too.  CBDs are really helping our furbabies. Its all natural. Just something to think about instead of chemo. This video "Cannabis Oil Works Period!' On Y.T explains alot.
367 2018-05-08 23:24:24 So you believe allowing Iran to send oil money to fund terrorism all over the world is a smart move?
368 2018-05-08 23:24:21 LOL...good one. You may not know this but from 2001 to 2009, the Great Bush/Cheney leadership (you know two guys DEEP in oil) led to a drop from 5.8 million barrels per day being produced to 5 million bpd
. By the time Obama was in office seven years we were at 9.4 bpd.

375 2018-05-08 23:23:51 You know, those KEY allies funding Head chopping Jihadists. Those allies? It's not about allies anyway. It's about money, oil, and greed. Always has been, always will be. These allies were responsible for funding 9/11 attacks. They Sound like a bunch of real pals.
376 2018-05-08 23:23:51 oil rice......all you need is red oil, pepper,crayfish,fish and onion won't cost up to 800 naira
377 2018-05-08 23:23:44 Great. Have you told the big oil lobby and the Trump administration? Great job on China tariffs. When Pruitt’s done spending money I’m sure he’ll look at it.
378 2018-05-08 23:23:28 sorry, i woke up in a bad mood.
and watching a climate scientist make fun of Trump
when I have been accurately using the Sun to predict

Trump is a Mcguffin. He is there to distract EVERYONE.
oil goes from $46 to $76 on supply glut.

381 2018-05-08 23:23:21 So what's the deal in the Iran Nuclear Deal?
382 2018-05-08 23:23:11 The Indian Crude oil major resistance between 4800-5020. so prices will be few weeks to months pause there.
 Live price is-4749.
383 2018-05-08 23:22:54 Try cutting them in half and roasting them in olive oil and salt. Almost makes them kale-chip like.
384 2018-05-08 23:22:45 I use neutrogena oil free cleanser st Ives pink pomegranate exfoliating scrub and any toner tee tree oil and  clean and clear acne spot treatment and put castor oil on my lashes at night 
385 2018-05-08 23:22:44 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
386 2018-05-08 23:22:42 The Iran deal withdrawal- based on oil- not International safety? Do some reading people!
387 2018-05-08 23:22:37 FYI... I live in Oklahoma,  and though I have to pay higher gas prices, along with everyone else, I  also understand that, it's because of the higher oil prices that America is becoming energy independent. When oil price come down, do do drilling rigs.

389 2018-05-08 23:22:33 BS. Israel is big oil? GTFO.
390 2018-05-08 23:22:16 I agree Iran had a hard time figuring out what to do with all of the cash from oil.
391 2018-05-08 23:22:13 BC sacrafises our lands and coast for third grade, shit oil to pass through it.
There is NO FINACIAL BENNEFIT ONLY RISK TO BC.
STOP THE OIL TRANSPORT OVER OUR LANDS AND ALONG OUR COAST!
USE A TRUCK ASSHOLE.
392 2018-05-08 23:22:11 And today @realDonaldTrump gave a hugh GIFT to Putin!  Higher oil prices which helps Russia greatly!  it’s not about Terrorism.  Yes Trump can stick it to Obama he thinks but Russia benefits.
393 2018-05-08 23:22:08 I should break even on my oil stocks this week after two years. Sorry it took pushing the world to the brink of extinction , but I gotta do what I gotta do

397 2018-05-08 23:21:44 @realDonaldTrump lying about Iran. He wants the oil
398 2018-05-08 23:21:39 Which means oil goes up?
399 2018-05-08 23:21:32 Oh? Well maybe the USA will give us a reduced rate for oil purchases
400 2018-05-08 23:21:26 No, your warranty covers factory parts. As long as it’s JUST an oil change (no check engine light diagnostic, etc), you’re fine

404 2018-05-08 23:21:15 Could it be the main reason of the rising price of oil bc of the current political issues rising here?
405 2018-05-08 23:21:15 Cramer is stuck in a CAT-ruined-the-market rut:
1. Major utilities were down 4%. So were REITS. Guess why? Rates NOT $CAT 
2. Iran oil was sold to India and SoKo DURING sanctions. And now EU China shall not join. Oil going down was not incoherent. You are.

408 2018-05-08 23:20:55 Yup! Got the oil changed, mechanic left a rag in the engine compartment so stuff in the engine caught on fire lol everyone's safe
409 2018-05-08 23:20:54 I know there’s steps missing! Some people use oil too????
410 2018-05-08 23:20:50 Don't believe a word this snake oil salesmen is selling!
411 2018-05-08 23:20:47 Online checking the election numbers rolling in and telling everyone on Facebook, "Hold on a minute...am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?"
412 2018-05-08 23:20:20 I enjoy your choice to include my "libertarian" title which is a political perspective while my choice of saying "oil problem " was not wrong. The UK had a BP problem in Iran. 

And I give Zero fucks if u or anyone else "hates Americans".
413 2018-05-08 23:20:19 lol, anyone that doesn't understand the folks that camp out and protest for #cleanenergy #Water #Health #Land etc. are part of the problem, they support the #Oil Corporations and don't give a damn about our lives and what their #oilgreed Is doing to our #Planet #bcpoli #StopKM
414 2018-05-08 23:20:19 It's George W Bush Iraq War all over again.
Trump,Bolton,Giuliani and the ISRAELIS all want War/Regime Change and Iran's 4th largest oil reserves in the world
Trump has said we win Wars but we don't keep the oil Billionaires are going to WIN. American lives will be LOST AGAIN !
415 2018-05-08 23:20:04 Watch oil per barrel prices surge with every buck going to Putin's pocket...complete swindle....
416 2018-05-08 23:20:00 "Oil comes from dinosaur bones 
& the James Webb Space Telescope 
will launch in 2006." = #science
417 2018-05-08 23:20:00 Contrary to what you self appointed experts say, oil has already started going DOWN. Research before you open your big traps.
418 2018-05-08 23:19:52 Get cannabis oil it stops seizures most instantly
419 2018-05-08 23:19:50 Oil is sold on a global market. Any spike anywhere drives up prices everywhere
420 2018-05-08 23:19:25 I put aloe, witch hazel, and a little lavender essential oil on a pad and then froze them! It helped SOOO much!
421 2018-05-08 23:19:19 Broccoli with mushrooms, onions,peppers and garlic in sesame oil
422 2018-05-08 23:19:17 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
423 2018-05-08 23:19:16 I’m also hearing, although I have not confirmed a source as of yet that Trump is getting ready to open the US oil reserves so we won’t have to get our oil overseas anymore. That would be yuge in a bigly way
424 2018-05-08 23:19:03 if you buy olive oil in the plastic container i low key judge you
425 2018-05-08 23:19:03 Then you have no idea of what you speak. Trump not only cut funding to then today-he reinstated strict economic sanctions. No more money! They can’t sell they oil now
426 2018-05-08 23:18:58 This bitch really said “if i put coconut oil on my butthole boom you got a almond joy” lmfaoo 
427 2018-05-08 23:18:29 Oil prices will skyrocket which in term gives gas companies ‘reason’ to raise gas prices (not like they already weren’t increasing) right before summer (when gas typically increases anyway) to record high levels which impacts airlines, trucking for Produce etc! All = Volatility!
428 2018-05-08 23:17:53 He needs a war to seem like a patriot.
America has to have a enemy, in his eyes. He (they) (Russia) (republicans) want the oil.
429 2018-05-08 23:17:45 Of course they would. Iran is their rival.
I'm wondering if this is why the price of oil went down after the announcement?
If so, I guess we can call it the "Art of the Deal".
430 2018-05-08 23:17:42 I totally agree that the Pens managed the cap piece way better than the Hawks.  I remember how dominant the Isles and Oil were in the 80s. I know nada about you, except you love hockey, but I suspect you weren't alive back then.
431 2018-05-08 23:17:39 that's not even what happens when you blend a whole lemon why does this make me so mad (blending a lemon with a lil olive oil makes a lovely sauce)
432 2018-05-08 23:17:17 I wonder how many scientists actually realize that Earth's core naturally produces petroleum and science has always been an employee of Standard Oil?
433 2018-05-08 23:17:16 Nothing improves the price of oil like war.
434 2018-05-08 23:16:54 @steeletalk To be fair,  Global News does have the reputation of being oil friendly and BC Liberal friendly. The protester does have a point.
435 2018-05-08 23:16:41 "baby oil cross" y'all are hilarious
436 2018-05-08 23:16:31 You obviously have way too many claims. $400 labor and materials to install oil pan and paid $200 for new oil pan. Fuck you guys. Obviously treat people like shit.
437 2018-05-08 23:16:29 If your ilk are such financial wizards, where’s all the riches from decades of high oil revenues? You left us with nothing but debt and an infrastructure deficit.
438 2018-05-08 23:16:26 Oh heck. That's much more common that often accepted too - dd1 got immeasurably better when we took her off the steroid creams... that also contained peanut oil. Never did get her consultant to accept it was this issue...
439 2018-05-08 23:16:24 Some say Iranian sanctions will cause the price of oil to go up and help the Koch brothers. That’s not U.S. security, but Trump/GOP security.
440 2018-05-08 23:16:20 US said, lets us operate your oil well & rig
441 2018-05-08 23:16:19 “Oreos aren’t vegan because of the deforestation caused by palm oil production!”

Fuck, I guess I better stop eating fruit, vegetables, grains, legumes, and shit, should probably stop living in my house since animals lived on this land before I was here, too.
442 2018-05-08 23:16:04 Break even for most shale companies in the $50 range, lot of them are going to start there rigs by winter oil will be back to $55 to $65 range
443 2018-05-08 23:15:40 Oh dear their goes the peace prize his screaming regime change or uprising by addressing the Iranian people,oooh unlike Libya and Syria they have shed loads of oil boots on the ground anyone make America great again ??axis of evil to tick off ??
444 2018-05-08 23:15:23 Okay well then you know that the wars in the Middle East were profit driven oil grabs, so not qualifying the deaths involved as inherent deaths caused by capitalism would be stupid. As would the genocides of Native people and slaves in every single colony in the history of humans
445 2018-05-08 23:15:22 Cook that bitch up with some lemon, pepper,salt  and coconut oil. Then hit it with a rice and veggie you like. That shit is slappin!
446 2018-05-08 23:15:20 I hope that I live to see the day when gas , oil , and all fossil fuels are worthless!

450 2018-05-08 23:15:11 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
451 2018-05-08 23:15:08 I dont think it matters much France, Germany and UK said they will still honor it. Russia, Iran and others can use China's new oil exchange and payment system.
452 2018-05-08 23:15:06 @chefsymon I want to make your Mostarda recipe. All brands of mustard oil I look at are not recommended for consumption.  What brand do you use?
453 2018-05-08 23:15:00 Yes, Mr Putin will have one less competitor in the overpriced oil market. Promise kept.

458 2018-05-08 23:14:33 Because both had/have big oil in their pockets
459 2018-05-08 23:14:28 And it's good fats from the peanut oil as well.
460 2018-05-08 23:14:19 I think Russia wants high oil prices while at the same time preserving strategic equidistance between Iran and MBS. China and EU want low oil prices while preserving the same. DJT wants middling oil prices while being in bed with MBS.
461 2018-05-08 23:14:08 So now there’s no deal because Saudi Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen and the states and Israel needed an excuse to get involved. Now there’s a reason for war that will drive up the cost of oil and make a bunch of money for rich people who don’t care about you 
462 2018-05-08 23:13:57 I want people to keep they job but the room smell like murphys oil ass
463 2018-05-08 23:13:45 HAHAH IM GETTING MY CAR OIL CHANGED AND ONE OF THE WORKERS HERE IS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ASKED IF I WANTED TO BE HIS PROM DATE OMG
464 2018-05-08 23:13:36 The left wing Govt & their much further left wing Green partners are responsible for KM needing the rest of Canada to step up provide financial assurances. The world uses more oil every year. The demand doesn’t even FLATTEN until almost 2050. Build it now!!
465 2018-05-08 23:13:24 Who benefits from a new nuclear threat to the U.S. Who would gain from rising oil/gas prices?

#TrumpWorld of course:
1. Russia & its oil reliant economy
2. Saudi Arabia & ironically Iran and all the middle east oil regimes
3. Coal and Oil businesses

Who loses? Everyone else.
466 2018-05-08 23:13:20 NO way! You look like a model!! 'Woman with gorgeous face and features usually seen only in expensive oil paintings stands beside happy youngster who had braces for many years' more like.
467 2018-05-08 23:13:18 Seeing how a lot of people at the Met Gala are just adding a halo or cross to their plain outfits is like the equivalent of girls wearing cat ear headbands and eyeliner whiskers during Halloween.
468 2018-05-08 23:13:13 1) @realDonaldTrump hasn't thought through ending the Iran Nuclear deal.
- He plans sanctions on all countries that don't leave the deal-further isolating the US
- Russia/China benefit because they get increased access to Iran's oil & trade . . .

471 2018-05-08 23:12:35 They don't know Putin and American oil company owners make more money as we pay more for gas.
472 2018-05-08 23:12:32 Starting to miss Saddam yet? Iraq was the perfect foil to Iran before the greedy Neocons tried to steal all the oil. Now Iran is powerful and threatening Israel. So do Americans have to die once again to save the collapsing Petrodollar and Israel's behind?
473 2018-05-08 23:12:23 Who else benefits from Trump breaking the deal?  Russia an ally of Iran!  Oil prices rise which helps Russia and Putin economy.   Also Exxon and oil companies.  it’s not about terrorism it’s about oil prices and Russia!

483 2018-05-08 23:10:29 Because the idiot in chief has decided to pull out the Iranian nuclear deal we should see the price of crude oil spike higher & that means an increase at the pump! That’s the downside, the upside is this may spark a renewed interest in more people wanting to buy electric cars!

486 2018-05-08 23:10:17 He has an idea that pulling out will raise prices of oil barrels. And that benefits Putin and Trumps family.

491 2018-05-08 23:09:47 Yah, it's already more than $70 a barrel. F'ing Republicans always raise oil prices.
492 2018-05-08 23:09:41 Todays been an interesting day. Got my oil changed and seatbelts installed in the back of my old Mustang since it didnt have them originally
493 2018-05-08 23:09:38 They only want to negotiate better plans for oil That’s why they are selling their souls
494 2018-05-08 23:09:18 Probably also raises oil price.
495 2018-05-08 23:09:12 No it doesn't it, sticks it to American Consumers who are now paying much more at the pump enriching the Oil companies
496 2018-05-08 23:09:11 Is it true if I dump used oil on the lakes and rivers, it will slow down evaporation, so our water crisis will be finally be over? #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
497 2018-05-08 23:09:11 You jackass! Once again, you have SNUBBED our ALLIES. YOU abandoned the Peace Treaty with Iran, while our Allies will probably keep it in force. THEY will continue to buy Iranian Oil. YOU, by this move, will not harm Iran's economy, but OURS. Gasoline prices will rise....
498 2018-05-08 23:09:08 Oh sure, more threats. Tell you what Grand Ayatollah, make your move. It will be YOUR assured destruction.

Tehran will glow in the dark for a thousand years. Russia won't back your play, and they won't do sh*t when your gone,  we'll give them your oil for cleaning up the mess.

500 2018-05-08 23:09:07 Sooo, we pull out of the Iran deal and gas jumps .30 a gallon. Exactly how much oil did we buy from Iran? Oh yeah, none, same as before. Way to fuck us oil companies
501 2018-05-08 23:09:02 Y’all provide oil soak for oil wells? They seem to spill more oil than a midsize sedan. IJS!  #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA

506 2018-05-08 23:08:41 Lol I'm an independence supporter but that's not a good point to make when the white paper report suggested oil would be at $110 a barrel, not gonna win anyone over to our side whilst talking about it being nearly $80 a barrel
507 2018-05-08 23:08:40 I appreciate Iran saying they will continue to honor the current deal many other countries still support. #DipshitInChief thinks he can negotiate a better deal. @realDonaldTrump is dumb enough not to realize Iran has NO reason to negotiate NONE. so I expect we wont get oil from

530 2018-05-08 23:06:04 As an energy economist I can confirm your intuition.  Besides the fact crude oil has been rising,  gas prices usually rise going into Memorial Day.

532 2018-05-08 23:05:59 Colombia’s economy depends heavily on the exportation of fossil fuels (oil & coal) and is hampered by inadequate infrastructure, poverty, narcotrafficking and ever-growing external debt. 1 out of 3 Colombians live below the poverty line & many are fleeing the country.
533 2018-05-08 23:05:54 Russians Econ is smaller than Italy and Canada. Oil & gas are important but the big money maker is running a global organized crime syndicate.

544 2018-05-08 23:04:54 Guess who benefits from breaking the Iran deal?  Russia.  Russia is Iran’s ally and supporter. AND oil prices will rise?  Did TRUMP do this as an olive branch to Putin who will make billions from higher oil prices?  Watch the red ball.
545 2018-05-08 23:04:33 Ok, I'll bet a million Canadians would March in the streets for joy if Trudeau announced billions intended for Texas oil company will build thousands of wind and solar generators instead.
Oh hell let's March anyway.
546 2018-05-08 23:04:16 petroleum extraction = magma instability 
attempt to replace the oil in your car with water

547 2018-05-08 23:04:11 Lipstick formulas do vary, but we've found extra virgin olive oil works quite well for removing pout prints on our lids (provided the surface isn't scuffed). Hope that helps!
548 2018-05-08 23:04:09 It doesn’t. The Saudis are facing troubled economic times. They need oil to trade around $100/barrel to stay afloat. Iran cuts capacity under sanctions and US shale and Saudis prosper.

550 2018-05-08 23:03:38 Four monthly wires of $50k each

It’s endlessly surprising to me just how cheap it is for corporations to bribe individuals, compared to their likely reward for doing so.
Big Oil Co can pay half a million to some civil servant and presto a billion dollar project is approved.
551 2018-05-08 23:03:29 To answer you question NO  NO NO! it's not.....it's CDC doing the hide and seek and peek game......Lawsuit's got them shreddin' paper and runnin' for the hills...Hey did their Grapefruit Oil excuse ever work out? LMAO
552 2018-05-08 23:03:13 When I used to be able to eat pork, I’d go to this amazing sub place and get capricola (spicy) ham, lots of mayo, mustard, piles of chopped white onion, oil, vinegar, and Italian spices, all on a hard Italian roll.  So. Damn. Good.

556 2018-05-08 23:02:57 my housemate eats fruit salad with olive oil and sea salt and says I'm foolish for not believing it's good
557 2018-05-08 23:02:56 The pipeline to nowhere. Just like keystonexl, AB and the cons cried about how they needed approval, Trudeau approved and trump approved. What happened? Nothing, they never had enough customers, EVER!!!
Same with this, Asia doesn't want dirt oil.
Just a political con game.
558 2018-05-08 23:02:53 Crude Oil, Gold Prices Look to Powell and Trump for Direction: Crude oil and gold prices are looking to a speech from Fed Chair Powell and President Trump’s decision on participating in Iranian disarmament for direction cues.
559 2018-05-08 23:02:42 It's all oil and gas. If Iran's oil fields are opened up, Russia loses its grip on supplies to Europe. That's why the Iranian oil and gas companies are sanctioned.
560 2018-05-08 23:02:40 Know anyone familiar with oil furnaces or furnaces in general?
561 2018-05-08 23:02:38 We didn’t get dick bro. They got $400M, sanctions lifted to trade TRILLIONS in oil, and a free handjob from BO. So yes you remembered correctly

567 2018-05-08 23:02:12 True. If the USA is the only nation backing out. Then that isn't gonna hurt Iran. Things from USA gets funneled through the other 5 nations can funnel things. Just think if China buys Iran oil with yen instead of Petro dollar. Down fall of dollar.
568 2018-05-08 23:02:06 The Crude oil next 6 months cant able to move beyond 89 or 99. 
 Live price is-76.
569 2018-05-08 23:01:55 U.S. does not benefit from Iran petro wealth (china/India gets bulk of oil produced) & Trump see Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism vs humanity hence the embargo.
570 2018-05-08 23:01:53 Wins for Putin, and Russian and American oil interests. All Trump's pals.

575 2018-05-08 23:01:10 What did Lenin say - who benefits?
Who benefits from this?
Possibly China - moves into vacuum left by US becoming isolationist?
Russia - price of oil goes up
Israel/Saudi - they want to take out the Iranian regime

578 2018-05-08 23:01:01 Oil. It’s all about oil. They want a return to the days of record breaking profits for oil companies. #Iran is all part of the plan to ensure that happens. I filled up for $20 under Obama. Already at $35 under dipshit Trump.

582 2018-05-08 23:00:33 I wonder what position Carl Icahn has on crude oil for June. 
This Iran debacle has an element outside of international relations - its going to make billions for the speculators, those corrupt individuals tangential to Trump.
And Saudi Arabia.

591 2018-05-08 22:59:38 I hope all the rest of the world will tell cheeto his attempt to impose sanctions on Iran will fail because they will take Iranian oil and good.  it is time the world stands together as one again oppression by this administration.

596 2018-05-08 22:59:14 Oh, did you miss the part where the US has always been a Saudi ally? And that this development was partially for the benefit of their oil prices?

600 2018-05-08 22:59:02 Dear @BarackObama

Isn't CHIMERA your LEGACY?: As US now TOP oil producer/exporter while counterweight RU is EU's, if for "UNFORESEEN" reason, markets crash BIG, it's very CONVENIENT that OPEN CHIMERAS exist in Middle East as both OIL+MIC *ASSUMED* as HEDGES against such markets.
601 2018-05-08 22:59:01 Netanyahu will now create a pretext for starting a war they can’t win. The US will be drawn into it. This is not Iran of 1980. It will not go well but oil prices will spike again. Money will be made. Americans will die.
602 2018-05-08 22:58:54 what If you did nt marry an Oil and gas man?
603 2018-05-08 22:58:53 Russian oil prices are going to skyrocket and all of us will be paying $4/gallon for gas in a month. That's the beginning. Trump can't sanction Europe. We're in this alone. Russia and China will clean up. Why don't you know this?
604 2018-05-08 22:58:32 Have you heard of the religious oil company? Yeah they had 4 dry wells. That's a lot for recent times.
605 2018-05-08 22:58:29 Do you think it's the same stategy as the oil companies? If "they claim" there's a shortage, they can charge more $$$$.

628 2018-05-08 22:56:15 It’s not like they are a major oil producer but we understand
629 2018-05-08 22:56:12 Well, my initial thinking is that it is a decision not well thought out. I may be wrong, for whatever its worth, lifting of the sanctions have had some positive effects, though arguable. But taking us all the way back is not going to be helpful either. So, it's all about oil?
630 2018-05-08 22:56:07 Love trump

633 2018-05-08 22:55:49 Iran's biggest export is oil. If we slow down their exports then Russia will get to sell more oil and you think Russia is unhappy about this deal. Remember these words. Trump laundered BILLIONS for Russia. It'll all come out very soon.
634 2018-05-08 22:55:46 Save your breath. If quitting the Iran deal triggers regional destabilization (never mind if we stumble into war) and the entire imported oil market (not just from Iran) jumps back to $60/gallon or more, we'll see if domestic reserves are enough to keep gas prices down.
635 2018-05-08 22:55:43 外されてな…い！？

638 2018-05-08 22:55:35 How much oil are we getting from Irak?? , can you tell us?
639 2018-05-08 22:55:31 Given trump thinks he is a deal maker, i believe he has made some sort of oil deal with the Saudi's that was contingent on this Iran deal pull-out. That and his hatred for the former Pres, a man of integrity, peace, morals and care for humanity - all that 45 is not.

And Oh yeah, Oil Prices!  #Russia #Syria
649 2018-05-08 22:54:37 Maybe you can bring up “peak oil” too. That’s another one off your hit list right? Your a sick person that sees the boogeyman around every corner and you need to get some help... quick before you hurt yourself little boy.
650 2018-05-08 22:54:33 Bt u knw...tht can be any kind of oil or serum...u knw Whenever we get some oil or something on our nails...they shine.. tht also might be the case.
651 2018-05-08 22:54:22 Then we pushed the green independent movement. BUT, More expensive to extract oil in the USA. Deeper.
652 2018-05-08 22:54:21 The US doesn’t need Iranian oil. Europe does, but I guess you hadn’t heard.
653 2018-05-08 22:54:08 That’s not even the cost of an oil change on that car...

659 2018-05-08 22:52:49 112 crude was a result . prior to Iraq, oil stayed under 40$ a barrel.
660 2018-05-08 22:52:35 Not for money. Not for oil!
661 2018-05-08 22:52:24 Cannibus infused oil will kick that up a notch!
662 2018-05-08 22:52:24 Thank you Mr. President!

Made a grand on oil in a couple of minutes due to the quit spike of the $UCO ETF transiently surging above 
32/share.
663 2018-05-08 22:52:23 Honestly I love oil changes at the dealership cause it's cheap and they wash ny car. Plus, today they VACUUMED MY FLOORBOARDS.

 God bless them
664 2018-05-08 22:52:23 Not sure I get the question. Seems to me the value of oil - and thus it's production -  is at least partly a function of the ability to get it from where the supply is to where the demand is.
665 2018-05-08 22:52:22 GaymerBoi, you do realize, don't you, that none of the oil/gas companies with which Western govts do business are upstanding, peace-loving, earth-respecting corporations?
But if it makes you feel better, try going without any petroleum products, yourself.
666 2018-05-08 22:52:19 In 2012, Iran, was the 2nd largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries

Iran's annual oil and gas revenues may have reach $250 billion in 2015

However, the industry was disrupted by an international embargo from July 2012 through January 2016.
667 2018-05-08 22:52:17 Like oil and vinegar
668 2018-05-08 22:52:11 Yay, Moscow gets high oil prices to fill their offshore bank accounts m.
669 2018-05-08 22:51:37 Good for Russia as oil prices go up
670 2018-05-08 22:51:36 Talk to your vet about Tea Tree Oil for MRSA.  It can be very effective.  Prayers up for you and Sydney!
671 2018-05-08 22:51:32 There’s more. China will also miss out on coveted oil credits when people open accounts in Baghdad Warka Bank & deposit dinar... think I read Warka Bank has multicurrency accounts for dinar & Dollar & a card that pays in either. Guess Iraq win wins #Pip money in the bank.
672 2018-05-08 22:51:27 Because Obama isnt willing to bend over for Putin like you are!! Iran has not viilated the agreement n you just wabt their oil, so looking for an excuse to war, have your kids joined up?? We have had enough of sending ours!!
673 2018-05-08 22:51:26 Why would Obama break with Saudis and let them get closer to Russia? Wouldnt it make more sense to stay closer to Saudi ?
Cheap oil benefits Europe, but does not benefit shale...
674 2018-05-08 22:51:08 Laughing my ass off at the tears, the whining, the outright sobbing that the left was displaying that night.  In fact, I'm getting happy all over again right now just thinking about it.
675 2018-05-08 22:51:05 Grimmett: When people think energy, they think of oil and natural gas. But Kansas also has wind, solar and nuclear.
676 2018-05-08 22:51:01 The only work I did today was change someone’s oil, the rest of the day consisted of making ribs and drinking beer
677 2018-05-08 22:50:59 olive oil
678 2018-05-08 22:50:54 Ahhhh so like a Hanukkah story....but instead of oil it was toilet paper.  I don't know...but it has the potential to be a rather crappy story.
679 2018-05-08 22:50:46 We'll find out soon enough.  Venezuela, a socialist dream, is open to China and Russia; as is Syria, Yemen, Iran.  Russia will use arms for oil to manipulate.  We do need to watch China as they flex economic power. Israel would bomb the Nuclear Plants at first whiff of nukes.
680 2018-05-08 22:50:45 we're gonna go to war to destabilize the oil markets and make the US petro industry billions. We'll use lots of expensive weapons too so the Military Industrial Complex will make billions. We'll send young Americans to die for America's real God the $$$$
681 2018-05-08 22:50:37 I filmed @DrBirute and she gave such a wonderful interview on this dire ape ecocide...COME ON, no PALM OIL....omg
682 2018-05-08 22:50:28 @C_3C_3 @POTUS / NYS had loads of both oil and Natural Gas #Marcellus Shale #Utica Shale
As The rock band the Police once sang..." We're Sending out an S.O.S "
683 2018-05-08 22:50:21 Meglio per gli altri, tra cui le shale oil companies
684 2018-05-08 22:50:09 Another use for Lemon oil....

It took less than one minute to remove the price tag! 

Exhale indeed.
685 2018-05-08 22:50:04 Get some eucalyptus oil
686 2018-05-08 22:49:55 .@rich_goldberg sees Russia as the most likely candidate to try to skirt sanctions by trying to prop up the Iranian regime as a way to confront the U.S. China really does not care about Iran except for its oil @FDD
687 2018-05-08 22:49:49 さかたさん〜！
うれし。。♡ありがとうね〜！
688 2018-05-08 22:49:41 Also oil production !
689 2018-05-08 22:49:38 So should I send my higher gas bill to you at the white house or at Mir a Lago?? Thanks for the tax cut to feed big oil. I really appreciate it! #maga! #godblesstrump #donaldchrist! #GodsGreatestCreation
690 2018-05-08 22:49:23 Next time, cut them in half, pan fry in a small amount of olive oil, with sea salt and sprinkle vegan parm on them! Delish.
691 2018-05-08 22:49:18 Trump is just happy to undo an Obama era accomplishment.  He has no clue what he's done other than raise oil prices. The real "winners" are John Bolton, Steven Miller, and the other deplorable minions roaming around the White House.
692 2018-05-08 22:49:12 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
693 2018-05-08 22:49:05 Will US be willing to reimburse the countries for the shortfalls of the new sanctions going to be causing? TR is getting great prices for oil&nat. gas from Iran and is also shorted by US with new trade quotas put in place by Trump??
694 2018-05-08 22:48:56 haha future roomate oil payments under near future climate change scenarios? that'll get everyone to listen
695 2018-05-08 22:48:52 Trump follows the Saudis rather than Russia on Iran. I guess oil is thicker than urine
696 2018-05-08 22:48:44 In 2004 Iran produced 5.1 percent of the world’s total crude oil (3.9 million barrels (620,000 m3) per day), which generated revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion and was the country’s primary source of foreign currency.
697 2018-05-08 22:48:43 Wrong.  We are net exporters of oil now.  2018.  Brah.
698 2018-05-08 22:48:34 Where is the money coming from?......Stolen oil from Hebrew Biafra. Shame.
699 2018-05-08 22:48:14 Well, this is a win for Russia, high oil prices, and loss of any respect from our allies across the globe. say goodbye to your NK deal.
700 2018-05-08 22:48:09 Hij heeft het nu ook niet goed. Trump's buitenlandbeleid is gericht op veiligstellen van de kwetsbare oliedollar. Dat zie je aan alles (wapendeal Saudi Arabië, Qatar boycot en nu Iran met o.a. hun oil-for-goods deal met Rusland).
701 2018-05-08 22:48:09 1950 something - when Iran had a fucking DEMOCRACY and the US helped organize a coup to destabilize our perfectly stable government in order to install a monarchy, thus gaining control of our oil. the US has REPEATEDLY fucked Iran over.
702 2018-05-08 22:48:08 Mine came up with beastiality, chicken parmesan, and how to change your oil
703 2018-05-08 22:48:04 US imposed sanctions on Iran by the current administration may have very little effect on Iran &its trading partners, especially Europe, China, &India. The latter two have mastered the art of oil imports from Iran during the previous sanctions, thx to the inviscible Russian hand.
704 2018-05-08 22:48:01 Frack baby frack! Energy independence...We are a net exporter now. Don’t need Iran’s oil!
705 2018-05-08 22:47:59 I think palm oil is more an environmental problem than an animal exploitation problem and it’s still the most sustainable oil. If we want to be 100% environmentally conscious in the case of oils, we have to ditch all oils
706 2018-05-08 22:47:54 El chico este que fue a cargar nafta sin auto jajajajjaja poneme gas oil ahora dijo
707 2018-05-08 22:47:46 Hehehehe!
708 2018-05-08 22:47:40 Higher oil prices for SA.
709 2018-05-08 22:47:35 Eh, he blew peace in middle East for $ and oil, and now he'll blow NK unless Russia forces NK to agree to put their future in the tiny hands of a flip flopper with no long term vision and ignorant of well... pretty much everything.
710 2018-05-08 22:47:33 Wait me,I am khadijah too ohh.Amin.
711 2018-05-08 22:47:29 Also, ALL of last year: “Trump is going to start a war with North Korea with his provocations!”

Reality today: peace talks for the first time since the war 

Classic case of “The Liberal Media who Cried War”
712 2018-05-08 22:47:26 Just put a motor in the Evo with 40k miles and it’s burning oil  hoping it’s the turbo or I’m about to be pissed.
713 2018-05-08 22:47:18 Moose near the oil tanks on Mt. Bernard Ave. in #CornerBrook is attracting a bit of attention right now. I didn’t stop for a photo. Oops. #nlwildlife
714 2018-05-08 22:47:07 Iran's exports of oil to China, Europe and other countries will decline later this year and into 2019 if the United States can enforce President Donald Trump's decision to reimpose the "highest level" of economic sanctions targeting oil trade with...
715 2018-05-08 22:47:05 Trump ran for prez to work off his debts to the Chinese & the Russians! He pulled us out of the TPP to pay back the Chinese & is pulling us out of the Iran Nuclear deal to pay back the Russians! Oil prices will now spike! Which helps Putin & the other gangsters that run Russia!
716 2018-05-08 22:47:04 palm oil is v bad for environment
717 2018-05-08 22:47:01 Linda + The Village Bike (Penelope Skinner), Freak (Anna Jordan), Lela & Co (Cordelia Lynn), Oil (Ella Hickson, Phaedra's Love (Sarah Kane), Fabric (Abi Zakarian) :)
718 2018-05-08 22:46:59 Apparently the US is the only country in the world that buys oil. Interesting.
719 2018-05-08 22:46:55 Fracking is a viable way to retrieve oil - more power to them.  Love our own oil.  Nothing but a disease infested swamp anyway.
720 2018-05-08 22:46:47 Price of oil went down almost immediately after this was announced
721 2018-05-08 22:46:38 Those greedy oil folks aren't going to be satisfied until they completely destroy the earth and evironment. The ROOT of ALL EVIL is the LOVE of Money.
722 2018-05-08 22:46:35 Trump’s dismissal of the Iran Treaty shows his utter disregard for the danger of nuclear proliferation nor the fact the he has unleashed an arms race in the Middle East! Moreover here at home the price of oil will go up leading to a hit at our pocket books!
723 2018-05-08 22:46:26 If Iran realises that Trump is laying a trap for them, they will NOT restart nuclear weapon production. This is possible if Europe, Canada, Aus etc don’t re-apply sanctions & can counter effectiveness of USA sanctions. Iran should stop oil exports to USA & do deals with others.
724 2018-05-08 22:46:25 Watch out for Pruitt and Zinke then, they are ready to set up oil rigs along both coasts of the country with the exception of FL, he has properly there...
725 2018-05-08 22:46:21 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with Play-Doh.

727 2018-05-08 22:46:14 Can u put down outside the door instead? Another choice would be a line of cinnamon, chalk, vinegar or peppermint oil if u have those things around! I don’t know about ant powder but I know parrots’ respiratory systems are delicate 2 many things (candles, air freshener etc)
728 2018-05-08 22:46:09 It's eerie to see the US isolate themselves more and more on the world's stage.

Europe shares most values with the United States, yet Trump puts them in jeopardy with this move. 

Like a baboon steering an oil rig.

733 2018-05-08 22:45:54 Here’s to Oil Belt (post a picture of you with the tickets).
734 2018-05-08 22:45:40 What does peppermint oil do
735 2018-05-08 22:45:33 That does not seem to be an absolute reality. when the interests of an opening to the ownership of Venezuelan oil and the opening to gas stations of the American chains are hidden under the fabric of international politics.
736 2018-05-08 22:45:28 Aliens are welcome to take oil, coal, all tpes of gas. I prefer solar/wind power, would help earth. REPUBLICANs are to lazy to run hampster wheels they would hire/hide illegal Immigrants to do it.
737 2018-05-08 22:45:20 I *don't* moisturize my face, but it's because of the long-running breakout issues. However, I do like using the tea tree cleanser from Trader Joe's every morning (and the oil itself in dire spot emergencies)
738 2018-05-08 22:45:18 Good way to change the oil.

741 2018-05-08 22:44:57 Just a passing of pen and phone.
We all knew this or should have.
In a hurry to get "a deal" before end of term.

744 2018-05-08 22:44:42 Hold up Dumb Donald. The price of everything could go up because transportation costs could go up because the price of oil could go up! On top of that, there could be nuclear war in the Middle East! I just don't understand you!
745 2018-05-08 22:44:39 Olive oil and some salt
746 2018-05-08 22:44:34 The CIA is already down there.   They are fucking with the Venezuelan system, creating propaganda streams and inflaming citizens and urging them to revolt.  Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, 296 Billion barrels.
747 2018-05-08 22:44:29 my skin feels sooo bomb, thank you jojoba oil 
748 2018-05-08 22:44:26 It was millions not billions and it was their money. UN,State and IC all said Iran was in total compliance. You just screwed the reformists amd gave ammo to the hardliners to start an arms race. Oil prices will affect you indirectly. War in ME now more probable.
749 2018-05-08 22:44:14 what are you expecting will happen, exactly? Lay it out here so we can compare it against what does happen. At as much length as you need. Iran, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, oil prices, US security, nuclear proliferation. One tweet or more for each.
750 2018-05-08 22:44:14 Yeah, we totally could. We use it because it’s cheap, cheerful and yields loads of oil. Sustainable (ideally) should mean no new forward areas are cut down for the plantations. It also should be traceable throughout its production.
751 2018-05-08 22:44:12 We don't get our oil from them
752 2018-05-08 22:44:09 Boo Hoo, the pen didn’t work!!! The snake oil con artist is losing what little phony legacy he had!!!
753 2018-05-08 22:44:06 I dropped an oil drum on my elbow today /:
754 2018-05-08 22:44:04 India paid  $6.5 billion arrears in 2016 to Iran for oil imports during UPA ll 
Congress imported oil without paying..those arrears payments are being 
Offset with them. State Govts should reduce taxes as in Goa and Union territories..
@narendramodi @PMOIndia
755 2018-05-08 22:43:55 Here we go. 
The drums of war. 
Another middle east war, yet more regional destabilisation and global recession caused by oil price spikes.
Millions of refugees and displaced populations.

Brought to you once again but the USA.
756 2018-05-08 22:43:48 More lies. This is another break for your boy, Putin, and his oil prices. FU #TraitorTrump
757 2018-05-08 22:43:44 The Iran Nuclear deal has dually been the example of a successful diplomatic solution that kept the world safe from war and nukes w Iran AND is a large part of why oil & gas prices have stayed low. Something $7T dollars and 1.5M+ killed in Iraq couldn't do.

760 2018-05-08 22:43:38 I wonder how many of trumps cronies bought oil related stocks going back to yesterday or previous days.
761 2018-05-08 22:43:29 I don't doubt that, but I'm critical of your input, especially considering your financial capabilities. Oil sheiks !
762 2018-05-08 22:43:28 Tans coming along nicely thanks to coconut  oil

769 2018-05-08 22:42:59 If Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE boost oil production, what happens to the OPEC/Non OPEC output deal. Will others simply boost production, and the entire deal falls apart?
770 2018-05-08 22:42:54 You are SO right. Although given the number of Hits of the Eighties rock concerts they hold at Hanging Rock, what will happen if Midnight Oil falls into  18th C Scotland?
771 2018-05-08 22:42:54 So basically you are just a new born glory hunter...supporting a team that is on the up and might change your loyalities once the oil money is gone ?
772 2018-05-08 22:42:41 Whatchu know about being gay and waiting until you’re 2000 miles over to get an oil change
773 2018-05-08 22:42:33 Russia's entire economy is based on price of oil. Since the election, the price of oil has gone up 55%. This means that Russia's economy (ruled by Putin and his oligarchs) has seen trillions in value created. Same is true for the Kochs and Saudi Arabia. He enriched his friends.
774 2018-05-08 22:42:19 If they understand the diff between a treaty and presidential order they won't have a problem.
775 2018-05-08 22:42:13 @Pinterest Someone has stolen a personal photograph from me...and has added it as their own. I asked them to remove it...they added an effect and a signature (apparently oil on board, not for sale!). Have reported. How long before it's removed?
776 2018-05-08 22:42:12 Well i think the oil wont kill the squirrels as they get into much worse then oil but getting into the feeder can cause them to die when getting stuck.
777 2018-05-08 22:42:09 I jus slathered myself in coconut oil and I feel amazing 
778 2018-05-08 22:42:05 I'm interested in seeing how Iran will respond to Trump pulling out of the #IranNuclearDeal low key excited. Will they take a NK approach by submitting or hit back with tariffs/oil prices like China?
779 2018-05-08 22:41:58 and we often discuss "data is the new oil". there needs a better story created. i get it, that people want to opt out. i personally dont see it as a problem. as long as the government doesnt get it into their hand, right?
780 2018-05-08 22:41:56 Iran future is going to be unrest for a long time
the military industrial complex has taken their decision to seize oil in the region in order to establish their new monetary system and start a new era with a zero debt
i donno how they are going to do but this is what will happen
781 2018-05-08 22:41:52 If trump caved to this deal the left would have accused him of protect oil.. that’s what they did to Bush . At least there was no monetary considerations made here
782 2018-05-08 22:41:49 Lifting weights and still laughing at liberals .
783 2018-05-08 22:41:45 If you’re looking for longer, thicker eyelashes, castor oil will be your best friend!
784 2018-05-08 22:41:30 Once again president of united states will deal people of iran like (obama)with more money and oil and weapons for arabs!! Why not? Iran regime have  more benefits for usa and uk!!yes or not? Will see..
We just born to watch how you and you’re compatriot spend our oil &money
785 2018-05-08 22:41:29 So will Koch Brothers if Iran oil sanctions cause the price of oil to go up and they make more money.
786 2018-05-08 22:41:29 Keep your eye on oil prices.
787 2018-05-08 22:41:24 DHC deep cleansing oil. Perfect for filthy post-barn skin but also gentle

Josie Maran spf 47 argan moisturiser, but that might be better for dry skin?
788 2018-05-08 22:41:19 Iran is a major producer in the OPEC oil cartel and renewed sanctions could impact its exports, potentially driving up oil prices.
789 2018-05-08 22:41:14 But oil prices will rise and Trump, the Saudis and Russians’ plaything, can pay them back now
790 2018-05-08 22:41:01 Ok. Tossing that script. How about Aliens land and steal all our Oil, Coal, Natural Gas, and Uranium and the Earth is forced to use Solar, Wind Power. Plus Republicans are forced to run on huge hampster wheels to generate power to fulfill our sustainable energy needs, forever? 
791 2018-05-08 22:40:48 Trump confirms US to leave Iran deal, sanctions to be reimposed on Iran after 90-180 day wind downs. Will also apply to eg EU companies dealing with Iran. Looks like another negotiating tactic to get better deal... 0.7mbd oil affected out of global prod around 100mbd

795 2018-05-08 22:40:19 When it comes to Iran, Republicans have wanted to invade since before John McCain screwed up and said we would invade them if he was elected. 

All about oil folks. Nuclear is competing with oil and our petro dollar based economy is shitting Trumps.
796 2018-05-08 22:40:13 Women like you are why most people see 3rd wave feminism as cancer. I’m sure you preach feminism but still expect the guy to buy you dinner, open the door for you and go do the dirty jobs like coal mining, oil rigs and rubbish collection so you don’t have to do it.

801 2018-05-08 22:39:55 Alberta and Saskatchewan should be booming in the oil industry but due to the constraints of poor government in Ottawa and environmentalist with no clue on real policies these two provinces are in a recession due to incompetent leadership
802 2018-05-08 22:39:53 But he's doing Russia a favor. Threats of war will cause OPEC to raise gas prices which means Russia can sell their oil competitively. Now that they have Crimeas seaport and the oil, they stand to make trillions.
803 2018-05-08 22:39:53 "Yeah, no kidding. I managed to find a foot scented essential oil and I don't even wanna know." *He says, grabbing a bag of green apple rings as well before hitting up the cashier.* "You find everything, Shy?"

808 2018-05-08 22:39:30 This is the theory... Putin is having Trump launder money he steals from Ukrainian oil.
809 2018-05-08 22:39:20 In for the follows! #MAGA
810 2018-05-08 22:39:18 So Trump pulling out of the JCPOA (Iran deal) will raise the price of oil. Petroleum represents ~70% of Russia’s exports. Am I coloring outside the lines here?
811 2018-05-08 22:39:03 And, for the record, at least one BC-based marine oil spill expert who  specialises in the prevention of, and response to, tanker spills around the world.
812 2018-05-08 22:39:01 #EU vows to uphold Iran Nuclear Accord despite Trump decision
#EU says it will protect its economic investments in Iran
#US #Iran #IranNuclearDeal #Oil
813 2018-05-08 22:39:01 It’s so infuriating to know that there is benefit for *everyone* with renewables like solar, wind, water, algae. Everyone profits and the environment benefits.

But Citizens United enables oil, gas, coal lobbies to buy our representatives. 

We are not #winning
814 2018-05-08 22:39:01 what's up with old punks supporting oil and gas? supporting big industry is unpunk guys
815 2018-05-08 22:38:59 No Iran deal, oil goes to 80 for Saudi's target number.
816 2018-05-08 22:38:56 Cut them into halves or if they’re large thirds. Then cook them on low-medium heat in a bit of olive oil with salt, pepper, and a smidge of garlic salt. Rotate them until both sides are nicely browned and you can easily cut through them with a fork. :)
817 2018-05-08 22:38:48 as a veteran, one can take the position that the US can rank with any nation as a sponsor of terrorism - simply ask Iranian students and family of the democratically elected PM Muhammed Mossadegh victim of the Iranian Coup de tat based on BP Oil... I yet believe we can be better
818 2018-05-08 22:38:45 The USA sponsors terrorism , supports rogue regimes . Enforces regime change fir oil companies, corrupts and kills innocent people , you are nowt but the Israeli patsie, May god give you a horrible death
819 2018-05-08 22:38:36 Trump has just thrown a match in a pool of oil..the oil we won’t get that will jack up our gas prices. Please get this xenophobic moron out of that office!
820 2018-05-08 22:38:34 @RichardEngel @NBCNews how much oil does Iran export, could this really impact US gas prices like some news outlets are reporting?
821 2018-05-08 22:38:33 Just look up “Peak Oil” and there you will find that they hit that in the 60’s.

823 2018-05-08 22:38:16 US oil closed down 2.36% to $69.06 today, but it is up 14.3% YTD. Global benchmark Brent up 12% YTD.

826 2018-05-08 22:38:10 Thanks for your reply. What do you think about the use of vegetable oils such as EVOO or macadamia nut oil (they seem healthier compared with a lot of others) in cooking, dressings etc?
827 2018-05-08 22:38:05 Mf I had brothers that died over the government cover up of 9/11 why don’t u come out with the truth of that on how there was no hijackers it was all a set up to get control over oil

@FoxNews
@POTUS

I assume that OPEC will get some abuse from Trumpy Dumpty because the oil price goes up?

#SoStatesmanlike
834 2018-05-08 22:37:39 Yep. Oil companies will be able to pay a penny for RINs and not blend anything at all. They get their market share back, corn plummets to $2
835 2018-05-08 22:37:35 No fall back to retain constraints? Like billions of dollars cash delivered in the middle of the night. Dude take a lap
836 2018-05-08 22:37:34 I don't knoooow.  I mean Iran's self inspections said they were all good!   Yeesh.
837 2018-05-08 22:37:23 And China and the UK.  You're left with just Saudi Arabia, Israel and the UAE on your side. Enjoy your oil prices sky rocketing and you becoming less important on the world stage.  This is just what China and Russia wanted.  Well done
838 2018-05-08 22:37:22 Pulling out of the Iran deal will create uneasiness in the oil market and drive up prices giving Putin a gift of billions of $’s in needed cash from oil exports. I guess it pays to be a friend of Trump.... Sanctions?  What sanctions?
839 2018-05-08 22:37:21 That really won't work and it is not a good thing to be spreading misinformation like that. The ONLY repellents that work are ones with ingredients DEET, Icaridin, Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (not lemon oil or essential oil) and IR3535
840 2018-05-08 22:37:13 some lady was looking at the oil burners and said “omg I need to get out of here before I buy everything in here .” 
I’m not supposed to judge but ew
841 2018-05-08 22:37:13 How many times have you met with the so called International Oil companies to address the issues regarding THE WORST OIL SPILLS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION in the whole world that is happening in Nigeria?  Which by the way, are caused by this same people. #OilIsNotTheSolution.
842 2018-05-08 22:37:11 So you think oil prices will only be going up in Russia? 

You people are so gullible you believe everything you read.
843 2018-05-08 22:36:59 Cheaper oil.
844 2018-05-08 22:36:58 Oligarchy wants to control oil prices too!  They need oil to go up since investing big money in oil funded by illegal banking/loans that are due soon.  They will lose big $$ if oil stays where it is.  Wars/global instability keep oil up.  Putin/Oligarchy are very happy today!
845 2018-05-08 22:36:49 
846 2018-05-08 22:36:49 Ha. Forgot I had an oil leak and some hot oil just dropped on my face
847 2018-05-08 22:36:47 Interesting understanding of water law in Texas.  Do droughts create shortages or does government regulation? Would we have more oil in Texas if we regulated oil like groundwater, and would it cost more,or less?
848 2018-05-08 22:36:39 @realDonaldTrump 
You should read “The Real Reason Trump Abandoned the Iran Deal” an article in Palmer Report. He’s got it in one. U r so desperate & so jealous of PRESIDENT Obama u risk the U.S. economy ( Iran will retaliate by not selling u oil/ price rise).  Sick man!
849 2018-05-08 22:36:38 The U.N. is controlled by Arab oil. Israel is a defensive country and never ever the aggressor.
850 2018-05-08 22:36:32 Go away @JohnKerry 
You had your chance
Iran has been behaving badly for a long time
Nice guy treatment is over
Europe needs their money & oil 
Too bad
851 2018-05-08 22:36:30 How much do you stand to gain when the price of oil skyrockets genius?
852 2018-05-08 22:36:21 you know your dad's moroccan when he tells you to drink some olive oil to heal your allergies
853 2018-05-08 22:36:05 Things are starting to happen. We'll see if the Ayatollahs' opposition at home can capitalize. Oil prices falling was not an effect I had thought likely. That's very interesting.
854 2018-05-08 22:36:02 Hmmm, now that Iran can pursue nuclear weapons, I wonder where they can get some on the cheap. I wonder if there are any countries - maybe in the north - that need oil and have nuclear weapons to trade. Like maybe a country that loves kimchi & bulgogi. Nope, can't think of any.
855 2018-05-08 22:35:57 Right I understand chemistry and biology and my great aunt worked on the Manhattan project as a lead chemist, you want to sell me what kind of snake oil as being perfectly safe, when I know for fact it mimics glocyo molecules which the human body cannot detect when causes DNA err
856 2018-05-08 22:35:52 I suspect this would make China the sole buyer of Iranian oil. This helps China obtain supply and greatly increases their bargaining position.
857 2018-05-08 22:35:51 And russia will now be able to sell more oil at higher prices.  Isn't that a nice fit?
858 2018-05-08 22:35:45 Have you tried the Estée Lauder double wear ? What primer do you use? Try using an oil, like the tarte one

861 2018-05-08 22:35:34 I also learned that coconut oil naturally kills the bacteria that acne has and I was breaking out on my forehead and it's pretty much all clear now 
862 2018-05-08 22:35:28 When being cute gets you a free cabin and air filter plus a discount on an oil change  god bless my face
863 2018-05-08 22:35:24 After I shower I basically bathe in coconut oil.
864 2018-05-08 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
865 2018-05-08 22:35:08 It is really embarrassing that Alberta squandered years of oil windfall money on a flat tax that only helped the rich.
866 2018-05-08 22:35:05 Yes, the Bush Administration increased the Federal excise tax on gasoline for California in retaliation for its near shore oil drilling policies. That’s why California pays so much more than the rest of the country.

869 2018-05-08 22:34:52 I'll typically eat like almost a pound of brocolli, cauliflower, spinach, onions, asparagus, etc in a day.  Lots of olive oil and macadmia nuts, etc.  I guess you could say my diet is 'plant-based' in that regard but I'll eat the fuck out of grassfed meat and butter too

872 2018-05-08 22:34:30 Did you do any research as to why Najib implemented GST ? So now its a good time to rely on Oil & Gas like during Tun’s time, while the price is unstable ? Maybe I’m missing something, maybe I’m not smart enough, please enlighten me
873 2018-05-08 22:34:27 I read it the 1st time. I disagree that the move today Will. displease Putin.  If causes uncertainty in the ME it will mean higher oil prices and there is nothing Trump can do that hurts put in that offsets the benefits to him of higher oil prices.

877 2018-05-08 22:34:13 how does olive oil fix all my inner ear problems djdkkd
878 2018-05-08 22:34:09 I mixed coconut oil and salt to do an exfoliating scrub 2 days ago (I had a lot of dead skin) and then last night I literally just massaged coconut oil on my face and then washed it off and all my blemishes are much smaller and my skin is nice and hydrated but not oily!!
879 2018-05-08 22:34:03 My brain, while making dinner: Mayonnaise is emulsified eggs, oil, and acid (vinegar, lemon juice... etc.). So egg salad is just crumbled eggs in egg sauce with a little seasoning.

You're welcome.
880 2018-05-08 22:33:57 Sanction should also apply to oil, banking and technology. Some Iranians channel their money through Turkey and then, wiring to foreign countries!
881 2018-05-08 22:33:39 No they dont. Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus is NOT the essential oil, which as always are one step away from being snake oil.
882 2018-05-08 22:33:29 My boyfriend is so sweet was gonna fry some chicken and he didn’t want the oil to hit me that he said that he’ll do it for me. My baby is so sweet. 
883 2018-05-08 22:33:22 And Russia gets to sell more oil at inflated prices! Win-win!
884 2018-05-08 22:33:18 or maybe a scented oil of some sort. you can find a variety of fragrances online these days.
885 2018-05-08 22:33:16 Ian please help a confused Brit to understand the Iran situation.  Can you assume I'm an idiot who knows little other than about the 1953 coup to overthrow leader and basically nab all the rights to all of the oil spawning BP.  What has been the real situation there?
886 2018-05-08 22:33:15 Like Trumpet never lies..lol!! #USPolitics actually the Nuclear Commission confirmed 10 times that Iran complied with the deal...this is about selling your oil, US oil should be banned in all countries.
887 2018-05-08 22:33:11 His whole purpose being placed as President is to get oil prices up. Oligarchy wants to control our resources.  Investments need to make money before those loans are due.  Putin is very happy right now!  Why the mainstream media isn't covering this is beyond me!
888 2018-05-08 22:33:09 So oil prices will go up thus gas prices will go up. And there we have the reason to end deal. All the rest is .
889 2018-05-08 22:33:09 @Enlarged_Muffin and I can do an oil change, rotate, and inspection in 7 minutes so that cool

891 2018-05-08 22:33:03 My method: put all ingredients in Cuisinart except the water. Turn it on. Slowly pour the water in until the dough comes together. Sometimes it needs more water than others, depending. Knead for a few seconds, remove and place dough in bowl rubbed with olive oil.
892 2018-05-08 22:33:00 Garlic pesto sauce, chicken, mozzarella, feta, spinach, tomatoes roasted garlic, oregano, and olive oil.
893 2018-05-08 22:32:50 They have done that since at least 15 years ago; mines, gold, oil storage, housing, land in Africa and Ukraina are examples.
894 2018-05-08 22:32:47 No expert on that area, but I don't think SA exterminates Yemen because they have oil. More likely because they are simply allied with their enemy, Iran. And US and UK fuel the massacre.
895 2018-05-08 22:32:42 We export oil now and there is plenty of gas - if prices jump it is bogus opportunism and state taxes

901 2018-05-08 22:32:07 They were going to nationalise their oil pushing out American & British oil companies. So Churchill & Truman conspired against the Iranian gov't & installed the Shah of Iran, a dictator. I wonder why they don't like us ?
902 2018-05-08 22:32:04 Smell the money as my wife would say smelling the oil?

905 2018-05-08 22:31:15 Oil prices are up!
906 2018-05-08 22:31:14 I don't know what to make of the morality of this Iran deal thing ... just expect oil and petrol prices to spike! .. easy to join the bandwagon and attack Trump but I honestly don't know and not well informed enough to have a fair opinion
907 2018-05-08 22:31:12 They been working an oil for food deal like with saddam or something? #journalism
908 2018-05-08 22:31:12 Oh yeah too true. I meant to put Trump's oil buds in there as well but spaced on it.
909 2018-05-08 22:30:55 Trump ran for prez to work off his debts to the Chinese & the Russians! He pulled us out of the TPP to pay back the Chinese & is pulling us out of the Iran Nuclear deal to pay back the Russians! Oil prices will now spike! Which helps put in & the other gangsters that run Russia!
910 2018-05-08 22:30:53 On top of wars and global instability keeping oil prices up.  Russia has oil fields waiting to supply US with oil.  Think Lithuanian pipelines too.  These oil investments were funded with illegal bank loans that are due soon.  Timing is interesting on this.
911 2018-05-08 22:30:50 He's been told time and again, do not have that pipeline built. Obama stopped it, but naturally Trump pulled an in-your-face move and had it done. Almost immediately, there was an accident and millions of gallons of oil were spilled. His silly tax scam only served to make...
912 2018-05-08 22:30:39 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

918 2018-05-08 22:30:04 Question is more:

Will #Russia stand for their allies?
Will they run from #Syria - giving up their assurance of a multipolar world, the oil market, their only Mediterranean base?

All that bloodshed for naught?

921 2018-05-08 22:29:48 I just don't get it the president is too worried about himself and nothing but himself let the prices of oil go up he has all the money in the world no worries for him I bet he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal because it was Obama's plan and he just wants to dismantle it
922 2018-05-08 22:29:38 If you need help I got some good hot oil 
923 2018-05-08 22:29:37 Followed by @BarackObama and blocked by @DonaldJTrumpJr is his claim to fame. Claims to understand macroeconomics, stating US gas prices will increase now because of the pull out. BTW, US decreased buying Iranian Oil in 1980 to almost zero and ended buying it completely in 1992
924 2018-05-08 22:29:37 Here we go...how much money do you all think Isreal is giving to Kushie and the crime  kushie fly business.. and how much to trump crime fly.....? To pay for Criminal trump to step out of Iran deal so Isreal could attack! Also Putin is going to get more oil money now .

936 2018-05-08 22:28:45 I do of course but let’s not pretend like the reason we’re in Iran and the Mid East in general is for anything but the petrol dollar. It’s about the oil. It’s always been about the oil.
937 2018-05-08 22:28:43 Great job driving up the price of oil/gasoline, which will kill the economy.  50 cents a gallon in the past week.  Stupidty has consequences.
938 2018-05-08 22:28:41 I have been using Oil of Olay daily since I was 23 and I look pretty fucking good. Currently I use Oil of Olay Complete Unscented (the box is yellow) during the day under makeup and it has 15 SPF. My face hasn't burned when I'm using it.
939 2018-05-08 22:28:37 CBD oil. Ask the Dr about it.
940 2018-05-08 22:28:34 Oligarchy trying to control resources and derivative markets. Banks/oil firms invested in oil funded by loans that are due soon.  They expect 2x/3x return on their investment.  Will lose big $$$ if oil doesn't stay up.  Wars/global instability keep oil $$ up!! Illegal banking too
941 2018-05-08 22:28:30 It’s nothing more than a ploy to increase the price of oil.  They’ll do it every time!
942 2018-05-08 22:28:22 Last few days to snatch up this Mothers Day deal! Includes the HY+5 skin care regimen PLUS a free XO lip oil PLUS a super cute exclusive cactus pouch!!!
943 2018-05-08 22:28:17 Henry Ford, Father Coughlin, tons of oil billionaires & elites, tons of British aristocrats & bourgeoisie & many french nationalists & bourgeoisie had been supporting the fascists since day 1, as their govts turned a blind eye. Almost none of these ppl were ever held to account.
944 2018-05-08 22:28:03 You need baby oil too. That's where the saying "It takes two" comes from.
945 2018-05-08 22:27:49 Because even with supportive family, there is only so much that can be done, and only the squeaky wheel gets the oil. It’s hard when others squeak back either to tell me not to squeak, squeak a little quieter, or squeak in a more sensitive tone. It’s a real headache…
946 2018-05-08 22:27:48 Or crude oil futures!
947 2018-05-08 22:27:32 Twice now I’ve started my Corolla only for the Bluetooth system to find and play @drivebytruckers “Hell No, I Ain’t Happy” from my phone. 

You’re at a half tank and have an oil change scheduled for next week. Chill out.
948 2018-05-08 22:27:31 Benefits Russia, whose economy is based on oil prices.
949 2018-05-08 22:27:28 why would you believe that? they lied last time sanctions were put on about this and over tightened the market didnt that?
950 2018-05-08 22:27:22 CBGB Oil
951 2018-05-08 22:27:01 病院
952 2018-05-08 22:26:55 Is there any way to remove hard oil stains throughout time? I’m starting to notice mine has them. I got my keyboard a month ago
953 2018-05-08 22:26:55 This may trigger a war just for oil money. Syrian intervention didn't stop Iranian oil, so Trump proceeds to ignore Proxy in Syria and go straight to Iran.
954 2018-05-08 22:26:48 Oil and gold will never save your soul.... well played Bill... love you!
955 2018-05-08 22:26:28 No worries. The UN is on US soil and it funds most of it. If it becomes a joke. It will just shut it down and you can start your own. All of the gulf states and all that oil Europe needs is with the US as well.  Guess Europe can defend itself too. There goes your free college.
956 2018-05-08 22:26:18 @maddow Was wondering is Trump getting kickbacks from Sauds and Russians for driving up oil prices.
957 2018-05-08 22:26:12 So, we won't buy Iranian oil, which reduces our silly, which increases our prices, which benefits....?
958 2018-05-08 22:26:12 Didn’t we destabilize Iran’s Democratic government in the 50s because we wanted.... oil? #TYTLive
959 2018-05-08 22:26:08 It’s not just Donald Trump it’s what Republicans do Oil under George W. Bush went from $32 a barrel to over $100 So he and his cronies could make money for the rich welfare class.
960 2018-05-08 22:26:02 The head of the corruption is in #Tripolitania,  for gas in particular the head is in Zawia. Militias control the oil refinery and send the containers to #Tunisie and #Libya borders. None in #Barqah
961 2018-05-08 22:25:33 Oil prices actually dropped after the Iran news 
962 2018-05-08 22:25:33 Please help sending my message to president.
Mr. president,what you prefer more , Kirkuk oil was under Kurdish control helped destroying terrorists and strengthen peace , while your representative in Iraq supported Iranian groups to take it  from Kurds and give it to Iran militia
963 2018-05-08 22:25:03 EZ shares -0.2%, US shares flat (after being -0.7% as Trump confirmed US to leave Iran deal). US 10 yr yld +3bp to 2.98%. Oil -1.1% to $69.9 (buy on rumour sell on fact). Gold flat, iron ore -1.7%. ASX futures +0.1%. $A 0.7451 as not much boost from Budget & $US +0.4%
964 2018-05-08 22:24:59 I agree Marijuana has a place in medicine and its CBD oil. The problem is control of the trade started with gov and its monies have infested everything from manufacturing to pharmacy. Its a bout a power ring that needs to be busted,  The prez took the biggest first step w opiods
965 2018-05-08 22:24:55 because Hillary & Obama made excuses about preserving our land, & environmental excuses. President Trump started the process of clean coal, & natural oil & gas drilling in certain states. Some Dems still opposing, but we will get there.
966 2018-05-08 22:24:51 You sir, single-handedly just doubled gas prices at the pump. 

I wonder if this has anything to do with your Russian Oligarch friends having billion-dollar interests in gas and oil.
967 2018-05-08 22:24:43 There are more oil reserves than you can possibly imagine
968 2018-05-08 22:24:36 Oil changed  car washed  car cleaned out  gas on full 
969 2018-05-08 22:24:33 @MayorGregor- Just watched your BNN interview sad to hear the complete ignorance spewing out of your highly educated mouth, your welcome for the transfer payments over the years. I’m thrilled your happy with the volume of oil and gas you have and that you don’t need anymore....
970 2018-05-08 22:24:32 So much for the tax break. Those struggling are now giving their small raise to the oil and gas people.
971 2018-05-08 22:24:21 US: Sanctions Iran and takes their money. Blackmailed them with their money to get rid of nuclear weapons. Proceeds to break deal (Based on Misinformation from Israel)= Profits from more sanctions to oil from Iran (Russia's Ally). Benefit oil from Saudi Arabia (US Ally).
972 2018-05-08 22:24:13 Scrambled eggs. Don’t use oil. Just plain. Or hard boil it and mush it up with a fork  it’s my dogs favorite
973 2018-05-08 22:24:09 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
974 2018-05-08 22:24:08 PENSIONERS & THE BUDGET: The LNP Government's answer to pensioners living on the smell of an oil rag......get a job #auspol
975 2018-05-08 22:24:04 Hardly the Fed as a monetary power, as you imply. Perhaps as a less destructive regulatory one, but FDIC et al loom large, as well as Chapter 11, less rigid labour markets, frontier spirit in the oil patch.
976 2018-05-08 22:24:04 Dow 24,360.21, +2.89, +0.01%

977 2018-05-08 22:23:56 Good luck trying to steal oil and gas cause u will never bij 
978 2018-05-08 22:23:53 Remove money from politics is a start. Here in Canada our government is still trying to build pipelines to facilitate better access of tar sands oil to a world that needs and wants it less by the day.
979 2018-05-08 22:23:52 Correction - Bonham Quay hasn’t happened yet. The developer is attempting to get planning permission on what is a derelict contaminated oil depot. As you say, it’s one of the first (and only) planning application in 10 years in a city centre area devoid of any regeneration.
980 2018-05-08 22:23:50 I hope America is ready for their sons and daughters to go to war so that oil prices go up!  Oligarchy is trying to control resources, derivative markets.  They expect big returns on their oil investments funded by loans which are due soon.  Global instability keep oil prices up!
981 2018-05-08 22:23:49 America, Israel and Saudi Arabia needs a Big Bad Bully so they can go to War to make Money and for Oil Prices to go Up! They don't want peace..
982 2018-05-08 22:23:48 Have you seen #Sumatra lately? Can you with 100% certainty say your supply chain is not part of the #deforestation and hundreds of thousands of acres of palm oil plantations that have been planted in the #Leuser ecosystem?
983 2018-05-08 22:23:45 Amin
984 2018-05-08 22:23:44 There is no difference between 'creating' infographics, apps and logo designs, and 'producing' oil, rice and steel... other than the fact that the latter are far more crucial to the global economy
985 2018-05-08 22:23:39 America which is run by Zionist israel is now lying about iran  just like it lied about Iraq & Libya both country’s did not posses any chemical or nuclear weapons.zionists want to attack Iran to control its oil supplies similar to Iraq & Libya
986 2018-05-08 22:23:37 Plus the price of oil is tearing up the market - it's raining heavy in Putinlandia. Beautiful puppy Donny, stir up the trouble, stir it up. Soon so much shit will be flying, they'll forget all about that underling accountant Mueller.
987 2018-05-08 22:23:36 The beach is overrated. I went to Galveston a few times as a kid, and I mostly remember balls of oil in the sand.
988 2018-05-08 22:23:28 Sure, US companies will benefit. But the Russian govt directly benefits, they own the oil in Russia. I never said anything about collusion, I just said Russia benefits from higher oil prices.
989 2018-05-08 22:23:25 While you're at it @MichaelAvenatti let us know when you have proof Carter Page received 19.5% of the Russian state owned oil company worth billions.
990 2018-05-08 22:23:24 FlavOR - formerly FlavRx. New look, new package - same great taste, same great oil!!
991 2018-05-08 22:23:22 Don't like you don't want to like you  ( BUT ) good job that's a bad deal  never could figure out why someone would be ok with 3 week notice before an inspection.... hope you're friends profit on oil prices because that's what this is really about
992 2018-05-08 22:23:19 ‘I use rapeseed oil aswell, im not a lunatic’
993 2018-05-08 22:23:15 Wait. I've read about operation Ajax and have actually wrote a paper about it. Like what.. and yeah British Intelligence was basically begging the CIA to help them keep their oil fields in Iran.
994 2018-05-08 22:22:58 Russia has a shrinking populace, an economy based on oil, and an aging leader whose leadership is based on a cult of personality. Russia is a decrepit has-been trying desperately to remain relevant.
995 2018-05-08 22:22:54 Babyyyyyyy you a winna for this info  I got mine from Carmax and they changed oil before I got it but not the sticker 
996 2018-05-08 22:22:53 Sounds like Bush when they were singing WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION in order to get IRAQ OIL.
997 2018-05-08 22:22:40 With the US exiting Iran's deal, Oil prices will go up and our Naira will appreciate more!
998 2018-05-08 22:22:34 Donald: “We’ll see what happens.” 

Oil prices going up or down. In another Republican administration, they can only fool stupid people.
999 2018-05-08 22:22:33 Bihhh that’s how I practiced it like KOBE
1000 2018-05-08 22:22:28 And I have explained that none of that would result from such a small amount of oil as would be found on that post. Unless someone was out there with a bucket of oil ready to pour it on whatever came near the bird feeder, the animals are pretty safe.
1001 2018-05-08 22:22:20 everything on my car fixed .. buttt ima need a damn oil change next week 
1002 2018-05-08 22:22:17 Mr. president Trump; what you prefer more , Kirkuk oil was under Kurdish control helped destroying terrorists and strengthen peace , while your representative in Iraq supported Iranian groups to take it  from Kurds and give it to Iran militias in Iraq to spread terrorism ?
1003 2018-05-08 22:22:11 Self portrait with a cowboy hat
Oil on canvas
1004 2018-05-08 22:22:10 @EkstensiveTX so you cut the oil pan on a Cadillac. And just what VOLUNE of oil is required for the engine size to both provide adequate supply while running and a reserve for that oil when shut off? Once again I see you "modifying" without adequate engineering.
1005 2018-05-08 22:22:07 “The nice part about workin on your truck is it’s a dodge so there’s no rust to fall in my eyes, just petroleum products Bc everything is covered in freaking oil”
1006 2018-05-08 22:22:06 This country was recovering nicely from Obama policies after the scare of 2008. Wages are still behind. Now inflation is going to really heat up because of oil prices and still no wage increases. Trump is running our country off a damn cliff like his bankrupted companies.
1007 2018-05-08 22:21:45 it's all about the oil, the oil, the oil
#tytlive
1008 2018-05-08 22:21:42 I look forward to things now like getting my oil changed and paying my bills on time
1009 2018-05-08 22:21:34 2. or 3 school leavers can discuss Scottish self-determination in relation to their highly individual studies of Macbeth, Dunsinane and The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black Black Oil. Which discussion is more likely to be transformative?
1010 2018-05-08 22:21:32 It was a real eye opener. I really resent that we have no oil fund. That in itself is a valid enough reason to tear up the treaty. Pure financial mismanagement, and a disregard for our country’s resources and people. ALL SCOTS, GET OFF YOUR KNEES.
1011 2018-05-08 22:21:31 I've been telling myself I'll go and buy oil since 7  looked up to check time at the corner of my screen now and it's past 11. Mogbe 
1012 2018-05-08 22:21:26 Net exporters of oil like Russia we're counting on your dad destabilizing their competition.

The promise he kept wasn't to America.
1013 2018-05-08 22:21:22 WE THE PEOPLE don't answer to "European leaders" who are BOUGHT OFF DAILY, are SOCIALISTS, and are ONLY INTERESTED IN OIL FROM IRAN and will allow Iran to do whatever they want to as long as the oil flows.

Cowards liked the "deal". 

INTELLIGENT PEOPLE KNEW IT WAS A LIE!!!!!!!!
1014 2018-05-08 22:21:13 Good afternoon. Missed the morning oil.....mean roll call. Thank you
1015 2018-05-08 22:21:05 We now have proof on why Russia and GOP wanted Trump in office.  They need unrest in Middle East to keep oil prices high.  These oil investments funded by loans are due soon.  They need big returns on their investments or they lose big $$$. Russia has oil--Lithuania pipelines.
1016 2018-05-08 22:21:01 I bang with the product line. Idk what the beard detangler is for, but the wash, balm and oil are the truth.
1017 2018-05-08 22:20:58 Sounds like the Chickenhawks in Washington want another Gulf War. Bet you can't wait for the Oil money too roll in.
1018 2018-05-08 22:20:56 this is to push oil prices high ! 

Even Iran wanted it to happen you fool , every oil producing nation wants it ! watch oil prices
1019 2018-05-08 22:20:53 The way his begging China after he  started trade war. 9ija will be "balling" see crude oil price reaching  100usd/bbl before July.
1020 2018-05-08 22:20:52 He's doing it to shift oil dominance to US. 

US Energy stocks got a boost. Soon we will be world's largest energy producer.

This was done to enrich himself & his buddies. It is consistent w exit from Paris agreement, EPA regulation cuts, & sale of Federal land for mining.
1021 2018-05-08 22:20:46 Idk if it’s just me, but when I sit and study for long periods of time I start to feel dirty. Like I’ve literally done nothing but sit and my hair feels like I put oil in it.
1022 2018-05-08 22:20:46 To be fair to @oldmanebro NKorea/Skorea good thing.  Syria bombing is some more of that NeoCon Full Spectrum warfare all about the oil stuff.  Our allies...the same allies who said that agreed there mass weapons of destruction in Iraq and applauded our decision to go in?
1023 2018-05-08 22:20:45 I try to avoid buying anything with palm oil in it but it's getting harder by the day. What did we use before?
1024 2018-05-08 22:20:35 it's not Real Coffee unless you're drinking caffinated motor oil
1025 2018-05-08 22:20:27 Honestly, how did I survive without an oil diffuser... 
1026 2018-05-08 22:20:25 LOL! "Power moves"? Bwahahahaha!!! 

Like what? He just caused oil prices to spike, imports and exports to go down, the US is now obligated to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran, including our allies. 

But yeah, you keep thinking he has some "power move".
1027 2018-05-08 22:20:13 The Iran deal funded Islamic terrorism. Iran supported Islamic terror world wide, and we paid them money for oil and to not build an A-Bomb. We stopped funding terrorists
1028 2018-05-08 22:20:12 Now watch the oil prices hit the sky, you idiot!!
1029 2018-05-08 22:20:12 That's not what u do tho....
1030 2018-05-08 22:20:07 Uhm, the KM pipeline exports oil overseas, none of it is used and refined here.

So... do you have a point?

I wish my car depended on oil from Canada too, but foreign corporate interests are more invested in exporting and selling garbage to the highest bidder than benefitting us
1031 2018-05-08 22:20:05 nothings going well & that proves that you dont know anything were in bad shape oil prices suck right now we as a country are not safe
1032 2018-05-08 22:20:03 I can’t stand these two oil stains. They remind me of a couple of caca  nuggets that won’t flush . What’s there names... Zirconia & Burlap?
1033 2018-05-08 22:19:48 Quit trying to control Iranian oil. Didn't backing the Shah show you anything.? We have built our country upon the backs of many countries
Puting our wants and riches above theirs. It's time to correct our wrongs upon the world. Time to own up.
1034 2018-05-08 22:19:24 Re-listening to 'Pedestrian Verse' by @FRabbits and loving it. It's been a long time especially you Oil Slick.
1035 2018-05-08 22:19:24 This has been the #Oligarch's plan all along. 1st to increase demand by curtailing renewable energy incentives and backing out of the #ParisAccords. Then destabilize the ME to drive prices up. All so #Putin, the Saudi's, and American big oil can rake in the profit #PutinsPuppet
1036 2018-05-08 22:19:21 Yes oil vl go up for sure
1037 2018-05-08 22:19:09 someone's 1000% trolling u. tell them to use ky jelly instead of oil. have some fun
1038 2018-05-08 22:19:06 And they couldn't have done that if the USA didn't make them all rich by buying oil from them YOU SIMPLY DON'T FUND ENEMIES.
1039 2018-05-08 22:19:01 I thought the leading state sponsor of terror(ism) are the USA. After all the regime currently ruling Iran is there thanks to CIA fighting for d̶e̶m̶o̶c̶r̶a̶c̶y̶ oil.
1040 2018-05-08 22:18:59 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
1041 2018-05-08 22:18:50 Unrest and war in the Middle East keep oil prices up.  Banks/oil firms invest in oil funded by loans.  They expect big returns before the loans are due.  If not, they lose big $$.  Russia has oil.  Think Lithuania pipelines.
1042 2018-05-08 22:18:49 How do I start learning how to do oil paintings
1043 2018-05-08 22:18:46 i forget...we want to do something but are worried about oil but then the saudis day oh no dont worry about oil it will not go up we will produce more and then we are america first?
1044 2018-05-08 22:18:28 I care more about iur air quality than refineries in my state, Senator.  Oil is a dying industry.  Look to the future
1045 2018-05-08 22:18:18 you cannot drink or eat oil
1046 2018-05-08 22:18:14 That should not cause our oil prices to go up.  USA produces enough oil for its citizens plus a substantial surplus.
1047 2018-05-08 22:18:08 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
1048 2018-05-08 22:18:05 All I can say is if oil start going down kiss the RV bye  bye..... Unless the do it before prices start dropping they will be broke by 2019..just my opinion  feel free to share
1049 2018-05-08 22:18:01 Trump to place economic sanctions on one of the worlds largest oil producing Countries. How long before gas prices go above $4.00/gal?
1050 2018-05-08 22:17:58 Mullahs have the EU supporting them as well, look at who's resisting Trumps decision.
And we supported the Mullahs' behind the scene so to speak if cash by the pallet is any measure.
Trump has hurt them in reinstating oil sanctions, that's whats pissing off the Mullahs, the $.
1051 2018-05-08 22:17:56 Just got off extra early.....gotta wait 45mins before they can START my oil change..... They already took my keys...bored out my mind
1052 2018-05-08 22:17:51 Provolone in thick slices w/oregano, olive oil done that way, then plenty of fresh ground black pepper, delish.
1053 2018-05-08 22:17:46 Oil prices jump for the first time in a while and of course I have to start using 93
1054 2018-05-08 22:17:40 You the USA are the worlds leading terror sponsor you tool. You have gone after virtually every oil rich country murdering and bombing children and innocent civilians. Stay in your own country and fix that leave the rest of the world alone.
1055 2018-05-08 22:17:39 all i do is think about bread and olive oil
1056 2018-05-08 22:17:37 All about oil Ann, all about oil. And corporate greed.
1057 2018-05-08 22:17:31 Did you get the chilli oil though
1058 2018-05-08 22:17:18 Maybe he could spend some time looking at all the oil money coming from foreign sources to fight the idea that #fossilfuels have anything to do with #climatechange or anything of social benefit.  #abpoli
1059 2018-05-08 22:17:18 Used one of those oil absorbent pads on my face and.....YIKES
1060 2018-05-08 22:16:57 oil cleanser!!
1061 2018-05-08 22:16:47 What about your unquestioned loyalty to an American traitor in the white house? This broken system as you call it also props up an unnatural demand for coal and oil. Reduce their uses, remove #lyingkeith from office, and you will see more renewables.
1062 2018-05-08 22:16:44 I'm sure your big oil buddies love this move .. I see Saudi Arabia is loving it
1063 2018-05-08 22:16:29 Chef Skinner cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Play-Doh.

1067 2018-05-08 22:16:26 Don’t ever fart in the same room while your oil diffuser is going....got my room smelling like LemongrASS.
1068 2018-05-08 22:16:19 Disagree. I know nothing about the price of oil.
1069 2018-05-08 22:16:15 China and India are Iran's biggest importer of oil.  I doubt they are going to stop importing their oil from Iran. What will happen if Russia and Iran come together on some sort of military agreement? This situation could have an ugly ending. @NBCNews, @CBSNews, @ABC, @nytimes
1070 2018-05-08 22:16:08 Israel bombing Iranian military that is helping Syria get rid of ISIS and Al Nusra shows what their intention is. And it's to attack Syria and build that oil pipeline #IsraeliCrimes #israel #iran #syria #bomb

1072 2018-05-08 22:15:58 How does a 200,000 barrel a day impact increase gas prices by 10% everywhere??? 200k barrels a day isnt even .01% of oil production per day in the USA! 
1073 2018-05-08 22:15:57 This is great for oil prices and those who own oil who may also have disagreements with Iran.

1075 2018-05-08 22:15:56 I’m so mad. I need to go mediate or take an essential oil bath. Maybe both.

1077 2018-05-08 22:15:51 Trump needs unrest in the Middle East so oil $$ go up.  Oligarchy want to control derivative markets.  Banks/oil firms invest in oil funded by loans that are due soon.  No big returns on these investments, and they lose A LOT of money.  See Russian oil fields/Lithuania pipelines!
1078 2018-05-08 22:15:46 Giiiuuurl I changed out my moisturizer for Jojoba oil. Fucking amazing. I’m radiating. It doesn’t make you break out and it makes allll the difference.

1082 2018-05-08 22:15:17 @HurdOnTheHill Looks like MMEX is supposed to announce Financing for the 1st Oil Refinery in 40 years in your district. What say you about that?
1083 2018-05-08 22:15:15 Honestly oil pulling has been the most affective and least painful for me.
1084 2018-05-08 22:15:13 it’s a dramatisation of the worst oil spill in american history that happened in 2010! i’m not a huge fan of action movies but it was super good i loved it!! i’m not sure if you can watch it online tho
1085 2018-05-08 22:15:05 ok.. if I read the eia data correctly,and that's a big if,  we export 71% of our imported oil as products. Right?
1086 2018-05-08 22:14:57 Wrong! The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gas. Ethanol replaced toxic additives like MTBE as an octane booster and oxygenate! It’s also cheap octane, so it keeps gas prices down.

1088 2018-05-08 22:14:42 The insane alliance of #Trump and #Netanyahou is like oil in the fire of #Iran. 
Personally, I think that Iran will not start an aggressive strike, but USA is about to ruin and weaken a further MidEast country. After Iraq and Syria is now Iran in the eye of an insane #POTUS.
1089 2018-05-08 22:14:38 Two strokes are getting rarer, and hence more valuable, by the day. They take up less garage space, don’t need expensive oil filters or valve shims and are are lighter to push around, so the RGV is the only practical, sensible, responsible decision!

1094 2018-05-08 22:14:33 Especially considering the madness of scare tactic , oil market manipulation , that will see oil prices through the roof once again.

1096 2018-05-08 22:14:29 Consider oil workers, unionized plumbers & electricians, contractors—even truck drivers & taxi drivers if they own their own vehicles. These are basically small entrepreneurs with guaranteed rates & rents by restricting entry thru government policy, among other things.
1097 2018-05-08 22:14:28 Americans will love it once they realize the tax breaks that got are going to the oil companies profits. @realDonaldTrump
1098 2018-05-08 22:14:25 BREITBART: Often use a massage oil.
1099 2018-05-08 22:14:16 I wonder if it's not the other way round.  Netanyahu's regime actually does what the Western powers want, hence the 'intelligence' on Iran.  The West needs constant conflict & chaos, so it can 'intervene', & thus control oil supplies.
1100 2018-05-08 22:14:10 They will bring Saudi into another war & instead of spending their oil money on developing the kingdom, the Saudis will have to burn $ Billions to keep three wars on fire & the only real benefierey is Israel; a rogue state Trump & his hawkish administration love to keep happy
1101 2018-05-08 22:14:05 The Shah is big gay
Restore the elected government that got coup'd for refusing to sell oil to Britain
1102 2018-05-08 22:14:02 Imagine thinking that US foreign policy, regarding the development of nuclear weapons by a country whose leadership has called for the death of all Americans, to be dictated by the price of oil.
1103 2018-05-08 22:14:00 If the oil prices goes up and I cannot buy a truck then it’s on new for me not buying a truck
1104 2018-05-08 22:13:58 Vlad Putin will be very pleased. 

* Chaos,
* Possible war
* Destroy relationship with allies
* Destroy U.S. reputation

Most of all:

* Jack up the price of oil (all he's got)
1105 2018-05-08 22:13:54 Yeah, but the all important outcome – Putin getting huge profits from rising oil prices – is about to be be fulfilled. Even if Trump does nothing else, Putin's investment in his puppet is going to pay off in mega-rubles. 

The rest of the world loses.
1106 2018-05-08 22:13:47 WTF? Russia is the World's 2nd largest oil exporter.
1107 2018-05-08 22:13:46 150$ oil and a movie of Bradley Cooper laying cunts out. Not bad really.
1108 2018-05-08 22:13:45 I know this seems gross but please rip the legs off and then cook it in hot oil so you don't get sick or rip up your esophagus. My dad was a survival instructor so I can double to make sure in not missing any other details, but he said those two things for cock roaches.
1109 2018-05-08 22:13:41 I just use essential oil. Seems like a more controllable option.

1116 2018-05-08 22:12:56 And Bank of China loaned the family I think $30M in 2015. So they have recent experience loaning unlimited funds to both oil & gas sector generally & to McConnell-Chao family directly.
1117 2018-05-08 22:12:49 Actually the Obama boom in drilling and increased mileage standards just did top imports. 

Still thanks Obama. We did not dramatically increase oil drilling in a one year spurt.
1118 2018-05-08 22:12:43 My dad likes to remind me what kind of oil my truck takes as if I haven’t been driving it for six years.
1119 2018-05-08 22:12:41 1931: Anglo-Persian Oil Company had a monopoly on Iranian oil.

1121 2018-05-08 22:12:40 DT has little to lose and lots to gain in an Iran war. Higher oil prices keeps Putin happy maybe even provides excuse to lift sanctions. Evangelicals will love it. Rally around flag helps in midterms. Takes focus off his legal issues. We’re going to war.
1122 2018-05-08 22:12:38 Not bad. Fortunately, there is not much oil over here.
1123 2018-05-08 22:12:38 If you keep your car in good nick (regular service, check oil/water often, look after it) then you have nothing to fear. New MOT will be better as it will show how bad any faults are. Besides most MOT fails are tyres and lights - that won’t change!!

1133 2018-05-08 22:11:56 What money? The only thing that will change is we'll buy our oil & other goods from a different country, likely at higher prices. There won't be any extra cash lying around because of this. We'll lose money.

1147 2018-05-08 22:11:12 I am pretty clueless about Middle East geopolitics.. all I can figure out is that Iran and Saudi Arabia have a Cold War on and proxy wars across the region and the  seems to be picking a side cos oil. Which is short sighted cos #carbonbubble #irandeal

Btw, gas price is going skyrocket , along w inflation. 

You think his buddies at oil industry are going keep oil price low?

1159 2018-05-08 22:09:53 We do not export more than we use, but US oil production hit all time highs under President Obama. Some is exported but we import more. 

Coupled with his increase in mileage standards Obama got us to lowest imports since 1950s

Thanks Obama!

1163 2018-05-08 22:09:14 Now that Trump has loosened our natural energy regulations, America is in league to supersede them in oil production within 5 years. 5 YEARS!
1164 2018-05-08 22:09:14 "choke Iran's oil exports" The gig used to be that everyone had to sanction Iran to make them end their nuclear energy program (cause more brown people possibly having nukes is unacceptable) but a deal was made. But we're still supposed to sanction them. Just because.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1176 2018-05-08 22:07:47 I have a question. Does the government in your countries give big oil companies billions in tax deferrals the way the U.S. does? I'm thinking that has something to do with our comparatively low prices.

Of course, everything costs more in Hawaii. Sorry B.

5th- Illegally bombed Laos (and Cambodia as mentioned)

6th - Encouraged the use of radical Islam to destabilize Afghanistan 

Policy/actions also caused over reliance on Saudi oil, genocides in Africa, coups in Latin America.
1179 2018-05-08 22:07:27 Lawyers will burn the night oil to figure out how the reinstated US sanctions on  Iran will affect shipping.

1180 2018-05-08 22:07:21 Except it wasnt iranian gold or paper it was US dollars which iran doesnt like to even use! So obviously it was given to them so they keep using dollars when trading oil. Thanks for callig me a moron though...

1182 2018-05-08 22:06:54 #OOTT | For the world economy and markets it is important whether this step will affect Iran’s oil exports. Here it is worth noting that US does not import oil from Iran. Iran’s main export markets are the EU, India, China, Japan and South Korea. @Danske_Research #Iran
1183 2018-05-08 22:06:51 Trumps going for it. He wants the big dirty. Denuclearize NK and straighten out them Iranians. A war wouldn't do anything but benefit the west anyways so if it happens it happens. Sanction their oil export at the very least hopefully.
1184 2018-05-08 22:06:48 An excuse to go to war based on untrue intel just like GWB's weapons of mass destruction int- there were none. Enriching oil companies ( and shareholders) and arms dealers -think NRA funders. A phony pretext pushed by John Bolton once again. Like a recurrent nightmare.
1185 2018-05-08 22:06:46 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1186 2018-05-08 22:06:42 Please then, tell me WHY IRAN needs to produce nuclear energy when it has the largest oil reserves & vast deserts that could hold millions of energy producing solar panels and wind turbines to sustain its energy needs for decades? #IranDeal
1187 2018-05-08 22:06:41 Wrong! Ethanol keeps gas prices down. E0/no ethanol gas is around 35 cents a gallon more in our area then E/10 reg. Oil companies refine 83-85 octane gas. Ethanol is a cheap, nontoxic octane booster and oxygenate. No loss in MPG in blends up to E30 as well!
1188 2018-05-08 22:06:39 They are also dependent on oil money and this raises prices

1196 2018-05-08 22:05:53 Vlad is thrilled. It will jack up the price of oil and that's all he's got.
1197 2018-05-08 22:05:48 Says the oil driller. What a sicko.
1198 2018-05-08 22:05:41 Oil spill in clean up, roadway reduced to one lane in #Jefferson on I-76 EB at I-25, stopped traffic back to Federal Blvd, delay of 19 mins
1199 2018-05-08 22:05:40 Yeah- the way nevitable rise in Oil price won’t be a big win for Russia at all. Definitely not. #ohdear
1200 2018-05-08 22:05:30 @realDonaldTrump... I challenge you to freeze all US oil exports and keep the oil here at home and keep prices down.

But, where's the profit to be found in such a smart move?

So, I'm sure again you will only think of yourself and to hell with America. trump's america in action.
1201 2018-05-08 22:05:24 Doesn't take much to know Iran's $s exporting oil - Iran deal signed, Iran shipping the oil & $s rolling in to fund terrorism & bldg. their missiles.
1202 2018-05-08 22:05:22 Russia loves higher oil prices
1203 2018-05-08 22:05:22 Absolutely. I saw them first when I was 9 (thanks, parents) and again at their return show last year at Selina’s. It was as though they’d never left. Such power. I was watching the new doco Midnight Oil 1984 last night - have you seen it? Will get you fired up! 
1204 2018-05-08 22:05:21 Alternatives are not economically feasible for transport, agriculture and home heating until co2 tax levels reach 200-500 dollars per ton. Meanwhile, big oil recieved 3.3 billion per year in fed subsidies. These rebates will not last and will in fact become general revenue.
1205 2018-05-08 22:05:15 There is a Huge oil reserve  in the Golan Heights.  Israel wants it. So naturally Assad must go.
1206 2018-05-08 22:05:05 As a Kuwaiti, I apologise on such individual act which does not represent our country. We respect all nationalities and will never forget how India helped Kuwait before the discovery of oil.
1207 2018-05-08 22:05:01 Just like skin care people that put coconut oil n lemon in your face scrubs.
1208 2018-05-08 22:04:54 Oil white pencils on inked toned paper 
1209 2018-05-08 22:04:49 Pick your shop wisely. This car came in with a noisy engine and metal in the oil pan. Never had an oil light on. Another shop had cut the oil pressure wire and grounded it so the light wouldn't come on. This engine could have been saved.
1210 2018-05-08 22:04:38 Ugly Blondes - Oil and Wine
1211 2018-05-08 22:04:37 Sounds like Little Donny is flexing his mouth muscle again. You don't even give a shit about the people of your own country. Of course there's no oil beneath Puerto Rico or Flint Michigan so...
1212 2018-05-08 22:04:36 Business News : Oil pares sharp losses after @POTUS announces US exit from Iran nuclear deal.
1213 2018-05-08 22:04:32 Gas is about where it needs to be. Any cheaper and the oil field suffers for it.
1214 2018-05-08 22:04:23 These clowns know what there doing, he’s following hitlers play book to the t, this facist is detrimental to world peace. If he can get a war going, a good long lasting war! Fuel prices will skyrocket an make these oil slime billions an billions, at the price of brainwashed troop
1215 2018-05-08 22:04:23 King Jaja of Opobo (1821–1891) founded Opobo city (now in Nigeria) in 1867 and shipped palm oil to Britain independently.
1216 2018-05-08 22:04:18 I use Dr Bronners peppermint/hemp liquid soap and hemp seed oil as skin conditioner. The hemp seed oil draws out acne so it can make it worse before it gets better but I think it should work. I wish I'd started much younger though!
1217 2018-05-08 22:04:16 Pulling out of the Iran Deal will see an increase in gas prices and Republicans will blame the increase on Democratic taxes, while the hike profits Big Oil CEOs.
1218 2018-05-08 22:04:15 Thursday price changes: Heating/stove oil to increase by 7/10ths of a cent a litre. Diesel to add 3/10ths and Gasoline to drop by 3/10ths of a cent. Thanks Trump for screwing up the trading week! #oilprices #gaspricesnl
1219 2018-05-08 22:04:04 Higher oil prices, alienating our allies, allowing Iran to pursue nukes, endangering the US & Middle East into horrific war with Iran (3X times bigger than Iraq), no Plan B, making Putin happy, telling World US is #Trumpistan... yeah... great. @LeahVukmir is a #TrumpCult bot.
1220 2018-05-08 22:04:01 Your skin is beautiful!!! Can you post a pic of the exact oil you use? I use jojoba oil & this one sounds interesting
1221 2018-05-08 22:03:56 Of course I have to convince Kiel to wake up and do the frying. I can handle grills but hot oil is still scary.
1222 2018-05-08 22:03:54 Auckland twitter!! What can I buy here today in AKL for my hair? My hair is curly (about 3b - 3c). I need a leave-in conditioner, some type of serum/oil, & edge control. Help me. My cousin in the US stopped sending me products & now I’m lost. Help ya Black Polynesian sis out
1223 2018-05-08 22:03:53 It’s great this was resolved quickly. 
It’s a shame the government wasn’t as compassionate towards oil & gas employees/contractors and dairy farmers.
1224 2018-05-08 22:03:48 Except all he did was put sanctions on American oil and force us to import oil
1225 2018-05-08 22:03:46 Gracias added to the weekly preview - busy times in oil land :)
1226 2018-05-08 22:03:39 Putin and Kim can help them build back up. Then we can look forward to a big oil war in the ME.
1227 2018-05-08 22:03:36 Really?  You don’t give a shit about how we’re ruining the planet, starting a trade war that will bankrupt farmers, end a nuclear arms deal that will push up the price of oil and line the pockets of V.Putin, and you are okay with all of that because ‘he kept his word?’  Deluded.
1228 2018-05-08 22:03:30 So true - Iran had those oil tanker ships ready to go as soon as Obama signed the Iran Deal - All Obama's deal d was fund terrorism -
1229 2018-05-08 22:03:27 #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA Is Olive Oil a natural resource.
1230 2018-05-08 22:03:25 If only we could get THE MONEY BACK!
We should all hope Iran acts in a civil manner, if not this time I bet WE DO TAKE THE OIL - to offset the cost of dealing with them.
1231 2018-05-08 22:03:22 Will you please let us know how to purify crude oil so it is safe to drink?

1233 2018-05-08 22:03:19 More charts coming later had a very busy day today and working on some other stuff. What a bounce in a $OIL we caught the move was awesome. More charts coming you guys have suggestions please post below which charts you would like. Thank you.
1234 2018-05-08 22:03:19 Jeremy, this is abject nonsense.

“Works for some people” = placebo

The real issue here is the charlatans and snake oil salesmen that prey of desperate and very lberavle people to sell them things PROVEN NOT TO WORK

Seriously, you need to sort this out.
Stop pandering to idiots

1237 2018-05-08 22:03:11 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1238 2018-05-08 22:03:06 I bet Michael Avennati spends more on body oil than the average lawyer.
1239 2018-05-08 22:03:05 And thereby take yet another step towards a war in the mideast involving Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq, Syria, and Israel.

Think of the profits! And the increasing oil prices for Putin!

1242 2018-05-08 22:02:36 That said 2007 was similarly caused—the over extension of credit, the rise of land rents as a proportion of GDP, perpetual war, deregulation, oil shocks (ish), the reverberations of 2001 tech crisis
1243 2018-05-08 22:02:29 @realDonaldTrump Against the advice of the rest of the world, except maybe Israel, as well as your own people, you have now made the single worst decision of your so called presidency so that you and your cronies can profit.
As the largest oil exporter in the world...
1244 2018-05-08 22:02:19 Tea tree oil!! My life
1245 2018-05-08 22:02:18 Banner day for American oil companies who benefit as much as Putin from expensive oil.  Republican senators from the oil patch, like Cruz and Inhofe are delighted with Trump's decision.
1246 2018-05-08 22:02:15 fwiw I heard that for all it’s oil reserves, the Iran economy is the size of Maryland’s.
1247 2018-05-08 22:02:13 and that is the same reasoning behind the Golan Heights, defense against rocket launches. Syria had the high ground. Unfortunately, there is a big oil reserve under Golan Heights and the greedy Americans and greedy Israelies, wanted it. See Genie Oil
1248 2018-05-08 22:02:06 For those of us who are out of work in the oil fields and supporting businesses, I am willing to pay a little more for gasoline.

1252 2018-05-08 22:01:12 We are not too far off from the whole “higher oil is bad for the markets” theme...higher oil is not what the Jones’s need IMHO
1253 2018-05-08 22:01:05 Seems like @POTUS NEEDS to Keep USING it.s WORDS to MANIPULATE MARKETS...already TARRIFS,TECH, OIL buy it.s soul.ish back from PUTIN..POtuS must OWE EVERYTHING TO PUTIN#POtuSENEMYWITHIN#RESIGNNOW#IMPEACHNOW
1254 2018-05-08 22:01:01 The passage of the #PIGB bill will block some leakages in the oil industry and as well as creating direct and indirect employment for Nigerians.
1255 2018-05-08 22:00:50 Who cares what Obama says, oil prices went up, that means all has worked
1256 2018-05-08 22:00:49 it is a long way to be on the break even price for Russian  oil prices of 120 per barrel... it is now only 70 usd per barrel
1257 2018-05-08 22:00:43 I fear they only care about the oil.
1258 2018-05-08 22:00:36 JCPOA inked by Obama & P5 + 1 countries that are USA, UK, Russia, China & France plus Germany & EU in 2015 made Iran regain its asset worth more than $100,000 billion that was frozen abroad besides selling oil. Seems it too sold oil on oil-for-goods basis without using greenback.
1259 2018-05-08 22:00:34 MNUCHIN SAYS HE DOESN'T EXPECT OIL PRICES TO GO HIGHER Vía zerohedge
1260 2018-05-08 22:00:31 thank you I love an oil I'll try it

1265 2018-05-08 22:00:17 Quick summer reminder for my pale peeps: if you think you can mix coconut oil and essential oil and call it a homemade sunscreen because Pinterest told you it was a healthy alternative, you’re an idiot and lifestyle bloggers thank you for your sunburn
1266 2018-05-08 22:00:14 We have oil. It's the resource curse. Less now but it destroyed our middle level manufacturing. A bias towards The City (strong currency) atherosclerosis than industry didn't help. And the losers were North of the Watford gap and West of Bristol.
1267 2018-05-08 22:00:09 If markets (Wall St) 'd react as it should to a move inspired just to gain votes & Saudi cash. it'd be easier to see stupidity of it all. But looks like Nasdaq, etc fine w/ conflict, pushing oil price
1268 2018-05-08 22:00:07 What did they win before the oil money apart from league 1 play offs. Small club and will always be 1.
1269 2018-05-08 22:00:05 Don't kid yourself, we Republicans are very much responsible for this debt as well.
1270 2018-05-08 22:00:03 In Arizona you don't even have to warm up your car. Your oil is already got by the time you turn it on

1272 2018-05-08 21:59:40 That’s what Islamic world is being humiliated politically,socially,economicaly & religiously,God give sense to these oil rich Arab Sheikhs.
1273 2018-05-08 21:59:38 @peanutfarmers Let’s try this again from someone who is so allergic he can’t even eat @Chickfilatupelo because I trigger out on their “highly refined” peanut oil. That one peanut a day won’t kill them junk doesn’t work but if they are highly allergic like myself it WILL kill them
1274 2018-05-08 21:59:37 Trump pulls out of the Iran deal.
Oil prices go up.
Russia reaps the benefits.

See how that works?
1275 2018-05-08 21:59:31 We're in an economic war with the EU. Theyre a huge economy. They used to threaten us with using the euro to settle oil contracts (huge $) until euro collapsed. Why do you think we've always pushed for Turkey to be in EU... Cos WE know it would be disruptive to them.
1276 2018-05-08 21:59:26 somebody told me that if you use coconut oil on your skin you're not supposed to use it on your hair 
1277 2018-05-08 21:59:26 Well, don't omit the uber-wealthy weapons, oil, and war barons, both US and international.
1278 2018-05-08 21:59:25 American oil companies, who share the same interest in high energy prices as Putin, also benefit.  Senators Cruz and Cornyn are delighted that Trump withdrew from the agreements.
1279 2018-05-08 21:59:23 He meant to say it will help big oil charge more
1280 2018-05-08 21:59:20 History? I just know Trump did these anti-Russian things:
-Tomahawked Syria/Russian Airbase
-Killed 200+ Russian Mercenaries
-Increased oil exports to hurt Russian grip on EU market
-Joint strikes on Syria chem weapons
-Ended Iran Deal Russia supported

Ur history is revisionist
1281 2018-05-08 21:59:10 Chop they heads off take the Gold take oil and let Gina torture the rest for information 
1282 2018-05-08 21:58:56 And made Russian oil exports much more valuable ...
1283 2018-05-08 21:58:51 No you haven't...I saw too.. pathetic..would rather have boiled my head in hot oil 
1284 2018-05-08 21:58:35 Everyone knows it was all about oil not for the people
1285 2018-05-08 21:58:24 This is a whole other can of magats.
Israel and US morons wants Iran gone.
Russia and Turkey do not.
=stalemate.

The joker is how early the Saudi realize they are about to be next. Interesting things might start to happen when they do. How much do you need Saudi oil..?
1286 2018-05-08 21:58:19 This is very exciting if you love Nuclear War. Finally the Military Industrial Complex gets carte blanche. If you don't have military stocks, it is time to buy them. Saudis and Israelis open up those bottles of Champagne.  Oil Industry? Look for oil prices to scream.
1287 2018-05-08 21:58:15 Got an oil change and my tires rotated and balanced 
1288 2018-05-08 21:58:14 US withdrawal from #JCPA benefits US oil producers & #SaudiAramco through supply pressure. If #Iran doesn't recognize the practical risks from #nuclear ambitions, #BalanceOfPower logistics & adversarial surveillance of #nuclear & missile testing allow knowledge waste enforcement.
1289 2018-05-08 21:58:11 Follow the oil money!
1290 2018-05-08 21:58:07 Oil prices have risen since #TheRealDonaldTrump speech today. Being as selfish as he is, could this have been his motivation? Help make rich he and his cronies? @maddow @HardballChris @chrislhayes @Lawrence
1291 2018-05-08 21:58:04 In New York gas is $3.99 in some places and heating oil is $2.92.
1292 2018-05-08 21:57:51 But Vlad was expecting the price of oil to go up!
1293 2018-05-08 21:57:48 Oil and gas prices on the rise, tariffs, inflation on the rise negatively impacting the stock market, runaway debt...so a few bucks in my paycheck doesn’t balance all that.
1294 2018-05-08 21:57:46 No, but my friend said it was Burnett oil in the Everglades too. Guess they must be pretty big donors.
1295 2018-05-08 21:57:43 First, I wouldn’t classify myself as liberal. Second, I work in oil & gas industry, I want gas prices as high as possible. Third, Iran and OPEC are different as most OPEC execs are Saudi’s (Trump’s ally)
1296 2018-05-08 21:57:42 Please, how do we relate this to last night's incident?
1297 2018-05-08 21:57:38 So I better understand your position, would you be for creating buffer zones around other protests, such as with oil and gas facilities, even if their on public land?
1298 2018-05-08 21:57:35 The oil industry apparently agrees
1299 2018-05-08 21:57:34 China has oil future contract denominated in yuan and I think oil purchases by China are denominated in yuan as well.  What you say is absolutely doable - how much political will there is on the EU side is the big question.
1300 2018-05-08 21:57:20 I bet oil prices will raise ten dollars a barrel real soon.
1301 2018-05-08 21:57:19 send me oil in the mail
1302 2018-05-08 21:57:11 Coconut oil while you clean the house or something one day. Do it when your hair is already greasy af. Leave it in for like 2 hours, wash it, and sooo soft.
1303 2018-05-08 21:57:07 毎度お馴染みの咳払いうるせーおっさんが隣に来てしまった
1304 2018-05-08 21:57:05 The Texas Oil billionaires who provided oil & credit to Franco, Mussolini & Hitler during the war have largely escaped notice & frankly I think they’re some among the most evil. They remained power players in both the GOP & Dems.
1305 2018-05-08 21:56:59 Yep! I just need an oil change and go get a new exhaust. I just wanna pay off a couple debts and get a new one 
1306 2018-05-08 21:56:45 Since Big Oil & BIG Money are more important than the environment, do you have any good recipes for a fistful of dollars? 
#StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
1307 2018-05-08 21:56:26 I need a oil change
1308 2018-05-08 21:56:26 Not everybody can afford the high prices of oil. Duh! Duh!
1309 2018-05-08 21:56:25 Thank you for sharing this. I will watch from computer later to enjoy more detail. 
1310 2018-05-08 21:56:18 It would be cool to schedule an oil change online, drive up, have robots do your oil change while you’re in the car, pay and drive off.
1311 2018-05-08 21:56:14 Oil is worthless if you can’t service your debt.
1312 2018-05-08 21:56:13 Wait until someone looks at all those Islamists who attacked oil fields back in 2008.  It was a good time to be in the business of selling oil.
1313 2018-05-08 21:56:13 WHAT ARE YOU INSANE??? coconut oil is not meant for hair or skin get you some aunt jackie’s multicultural curls n you’ll be ok to go it’s not expensive but having hair comes with a cost
1314 2018-05-08 21:56:11 I'm holding out for my car being able to drive itself to the shop to get the oil changed.
1315 2018-05-08 21:56:07 Trump said from the start he wanted their oil well here we go
1316 2018-05-08 21:56:07 @FiveGuysUK are both types of fries cooked in peanut oil 
1317 2018-05-08 21:55:57 And Iran will be feted by Europe in their thirst for Iranian oil.
1318 2018-05-08 21:55:50 Or that buses don't require oil...
1319 2018-05-08 21:55:48 Michelle, the strategy is economically squeeze Iran, create civil turmoil for a regime chg, make Putin oil markets a bigger share, say Iran is renuking, invade and fight proxy war on behalf of Israel. Maybe Colin Powell will do a slide show.
1320 2018-05-08 21:55:46 Same idea as currently between CN and PdVSA.  I would think the biggest issue will be specific oil production infrastructure items, which CN does not manufacture, but RU does, as well as OSC expertise. CN will operate as a black-market go between, undoubtedly, as it does with NK.
1321 2018-05-08 21:55:46 Let's see when oil hits $ 100 / barrel
1322 2018-05-08 21:55:44 I kid you not I get mine from the dollar tree. ANY vitamin e oil will work fine. Don’t pay too much attention to brands
1323 2018-05-08 21:55:43 "As for our oil, it was given away to America. It is true that it paid for supplies, but that money was spent buying arms and establishing military bases for America. In other words, first we gave them our oil, and then we established military bases for them."
--Imam Khomeini (ق)
1324 2018-05-08 21:55:37 Today was not just Trump pissing on Obama's accomplishment. It also raised the price of oil, which makes Putin & Oligarchs richer at huge cost to US consumers. Isolates US further from long time allies, making us more vulnerable for years to come. IOW, Trump works for Putin.
1325 2018-05-08 21:55:35 Trump’s oil and military buddies will reap immediate rewards.
1326 2018-05-08 21:55:26 Don’t forget all of the people living in Iran, living in fear that their country is the next stop on the America-Neo-Imperialist-We-Will-Bomb-Invade-And-Destroy-For-Oil-No-Matter-How-Many-Die World Tour.

I know my family is.
1327 2018-05-08 21:55:25 ((Because it wasn't about stopping Iran from getting nukes. It was about being nice to Iran in the hope that Iran will be nice back and give Europe oil cheap.

It was a foolish thing to sign on so many levels I cannot enumerate them all.

TRY USING COCONUT OIL and then lay out for about 30-45 minutes front & back
1331 2018-05-08 21:55:10 And oil prices have risen pretty dramatically since Trump took office. Even though US production is at record levels
1332 2018-05-08 21:55:04 Invade that shit take all they oil 
1333 2018-05-08 21:55:02 I feel like crying lmao they charged me that for oil filter, and 2 filters, and tire rotation and I’m sure my dad could’ve done that

1337 2018-05-08 21:54:32 Then they look like they don't even know how to put oil in their hair. Whole struggles out here. Idc who I was dating in highschool you wasn't coming out with me looking wild and dusty
1338 2018-05-08 21:54:30 Girl take black seed oil.
1339 2018-05-08 21:54:29 You need to be checked.Might be the oil on the fries though
1340 2018-05-08 21:54:29 So This is where you will try to take the oil... oil prices will be through the roof
1341 2018-05-08 21:54:28 Sanctions on Iran will be good gfor Nigeria sha.
Oil price go rise.
1342 2018-05-08 21:54:24 (Turn your analysis to the oil and gas sector and ask if it still holds. Or gun manufacturers. Or opioid producers.)
1343 2018-05-08 21:54:24 Iran’s now selling its oil on the Euro instead of the Dollar... 
Probably the real reason your Pres is so against the deal (that was working) from going ahead.
1344 2018-05-08 21:54:13 Trump is not only taking care of Iran nuclear deal but with economy of Iran free falling, he is taking care of the regime.
People of oil country are suppose to be poor.
1345 2018-05-08 21:54:10 #NoIranDeal - Leftists are [憨笑], Rightists are , centrists buying Oil stocks. Go figure!
1346 2018-05-08 21:54:10 It's about oil and Trump trying to erase Obama's legacy.
1347 2018-05-08 21:54:05 Stir in eight grams of olive oil then raise the temperature.
1348 2018-05-08 21:54:03 Tax cuts that were supposed to help Americans now are going to be spend for high oil prices. Good Job.

1350 2018-05-08 21:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

1355 2018-05-08 21:53:46 Hey @scentuals the dropper for my rosehip oil arrived broken in @mycausebox and is almost completely inoperable. I'd love to be able to keep using the oil without needing to pour it into my hand. Can you help?
1356 2018-05-08 21:53:46 Maybe you should hire an English tutor?  He clearly states “in terms of oil”
1357 2018-05-08 21:53:42 Because sanctions on iran would help saudi oil industry .especiakky in a time when saudi was targeting 80 dollar a barell now with iran out of the picture they could acccomplish this .iran was a competitir and was offering cheaper  deals to countries as it was a smalker player
1358 2018-05-08 21:53:41 US withdrew from Iran nuclear deal.
Economic growth expected for Kurdistan since this decision raises oil price.

Can @MelissaLeeCNBC save the last ten minutes of the bad show and focus on what REALLY happened in stocks today.
Not bitcoin not Iran oil. It was INTEREST RATES. MAJOR UTILITIES DOWN 4%. And big REITS too.
1361 2018-05-08 21:53:27 You really don't want to give plutocrats this much power as has happened now. And specifically, big oil is the one running trump .... With or without big russia oil. Ran Bush, too. Lot of clean up ahead.

But we'd be in really big trouble if Trump was as smart as he thinks he is.
1362 2018-05-08 21:53:19 Actually gas prices were higher less than a year ago!! And if you watched anyour business news channels you would have seen that oil on the open market dropped!! Imagine that!!
1363 2018-05-08 21:53:11 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1364 2018-05-08 21:53:10 First of, oil and gas are finite resources, by definition unsustainable. More importantly, global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, weather changes and the ecological disruption as a consequence are all due to the industry that Skansi Offshore serves.
1365 2018-05-08 21:52:59 Y’all slapping so much oil and grease on y’all face for this #clearskintwiter  I can’t tell the difference
1366 2018-05-08 21:52:56 Yeah, because being allignef with Sunni Arab states was working out so well. We bought their oil and they funded al queda and isis
1367 2018-05-08 21:52:55 I tried to use my broken mirror and it ended up falling and I spilled my face oil AGAIN

1372 2018-05-08 21:52:31 Sad to say, but Putin had nothing against the Iran deal. This is on Trump and the GOP 100%. Russia has more gas than oil anyway.
1373 2018-05-08 21:52:25 Tea tree oil helps
1374 2018-05-08 21:52:23 What is Iran's biggest export? If we stop them from flooding the market with their huge oil reserves guess who gets to export more oil? #research
1375 2018-05-08 21:52:23 The price of oil is only going to get worse now. Inflation here we come.
1376 2018-05-08 21:52:22 Cut off of 2 million bbls of oil from Iran should make no shortage to world oil supplies. Saudis has got available additional capacuty of pumping up to 2 mlns bbls. Why create hype to raise oil prices.
1377 2018-05-08 21:52:10 Israel and Saudi arabia say it. The Europeans want Iranian oil since relations with russia are not good so Britain, Germany and France will say anything. It was a bad deal
1378 2018-05-08 21:52:00 Thank you Mr Senate President Sir,

 Meeting with the relevant stakeholders in the oil industry will go a long way in proffer permanent solutions to the problems facing the sector in Nigeria.
1379 2018-05-08 21:51:59 But also security is not just nuke worry. europe loses out with any ME instability. Oil but also refugee flow, trade,terror threat. US may see Iran as big threat. Europe fears will just feed Saudi-Iran Cold War and lead to more conflict/tension. So nukes aside, security matters.
1380 2018-05-08 21:51:35 really, Who cares what U support. As a regime who owns so much debt of America I am not surprised that u both work  together. As a country that follows one of harshest Islamic law  discriminate other religion and people I really wish that all Oil that We pay u for disappear
1381 2018-05-08 21:51:32 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
1382 2018-05-08 21:51:24 ....you''ll be riding a bike, too, when oil prices skyrocket due to numbskulls recent move. Could you explain the benefits of this decision, or are you just another nodding minion?
1383 2018-05-08 21:51:17 This meeting is wonderful because as it address the passage of #PIGB which will strengthening the oil sector when fully implemented.

Thank you.
1384 2018-05-08 21:51:14 We(or should I say 30%of us+Russian hackers) abdicated our world leadership position on 11/8/16 w/“selection”of DT-he can’t even run a biz w/out Russian mob help!Now Russia&China will take over Middle East&we will HAVE TO use renewables-we will be priced out of oil #MoronInChief
1385 2018-05-08 21:51:12 Let’s watch the price of oil now. This ought to be interesting.
1386 2018-05-08 21:51:01 ya bitch bought oil paints today my bank's gonna kill me
1387 2018-05-08 21:50:58 Not if you sand them down properly. Rub in a few coats of oil and....
.
(oh, dear. That's going to be trouble. I just know it.) 
1388 2018-05-08 21:50:54 Nigeria spends $36.3bn on fuel importation in 5 years: CBN. - Nigeria must start to gradually put all her oil refinaries to full production.
1389 2018-05-08 21:50:52 At the very least this throws the world oil markets into chaos. Putin and he's crew are so heavy into oil that has to be good for their bottom line.  Anything Trump does I first think how will it help his handler Putin.
1390 2018-05-08 21:50:47 Saudi save in foreign currency because they export oil. Oil is priced in $ and they peg their currency to the $ in order to have a more stable and predictable flow of income from oil sales,
1391 2018-05-08 21:50:27 How do you know he isn't?  You guys are unreal, Russias main export is oil, they export it everywhere. Trump is trying to produce enough to stop russia from that much control. He has actually started exporting it to countries who use to buy Russian. Research
1392 2018-05-08 21:50:25 $AMID is risky for sure, but their infrastructure (esp offshore pipes & Delta House) are significant and GoM oil production is going to grow a lot which helps AMID. FYI I have a position and will average down if it drops
1393 2018-05-08 21:50:16 Anything except baby pooh mostly. In fact, what they can remove means I didn’t use them on newborn skin and opted for Cheeky Wipes. Saved the industrial strength disposable wipes for clothes stains, household cleaning, waterproof mascara, engine oil etc etc
1394 2018-05-08 21:50:06 European capitols are in range of CURRANT Iranian missles, Europe needs their oil & gas, Middle-East refugees impact Europe first, Hezbollah <50km from Israel. Donald has zilch "skin in the game"; why help Putin with higher oil cost?
1395 2018-05-08 21:50:06 You're still living in the 1970's. The USA is a net exporter of oil now and the biggest producer on the planet. Iran can go pound sand.
1396 2018-05-08 21:50:02 Aubergines + oil 
1397 2018-05-08 21:50:02 The Gang of three [Trump, McConnell & Ryan] throw away USA credibility of keeping our agreements, to wit: By breaking Iran Nuclear Deal to  raise oil prices back up for the Oil Corporations to make big bucks at the risk of more Middle East conflict. Vote Dems in 2018 & 2020!@CNN
1398 2018-05-08 21:49:49 What was Iran’s oil output before the deal?  How about after?  When you look at the overall economic impact, perhaps you’d understand why this is a foolish move. Use logic and please explain why this deal was worth exiting?
1399 2018-05-08 21:49:45 Our allies have already demonstrated that they are not as dumb as this #cult45 GOP and this racist @realDonaldTrump regime! I have a car that burns oil but it gets me around. Would like to have better one but don't yet. I'll get rid of it and have nothing #STUPIDGOP
1400 2018-05-08 21:49:42 You named issues that have been going on for centuries,the only real countries that America has gone into has been oil rich countries claiming to be helping them,when really it was for the oil,it's in the books so I'm not making it up.why is he pulling out of the United nations.
1401 2018-05-08 21:49:35 Only I would lose my tanning oil .. How am I supposed to get snatched for graduation?!?
1402 2018-05-08 21:49:33 How are sanctions that you say will reinstate help the Irani citizens that you suddenly care to help? Is this all to drive up the oil prices? Russia oligarchs and the Saudis should be very happy. Who wins in your inner circle? Why Bibi, why?

1405 2018-05-08 21:49:14 Miners are no different than commodity miners. They don’t switch because they can find something else to mine. Oil miners don’t switch to gold when the going gets tough. This is one reason ETH is centralized. Developers are in charge. Not just Vitalik
1406 2018-05-08 21:49:08 Neem oil works wonders. I camp a lot so I never go without it
1407 2018-05-08 21:48:53 She's just doing her part to #MAGA   

Good luck, wherever you land, Bill and Hillary. Just please take the snake oil, the snakes, and the swamp along with you.
1408 2018-05-08 21:48:45 Yes there's plenty of fish in the sea, but don't forget about the sharks, seaweed, oil spills, toxic waste and the Somali pirates.
1409 2018-05-08 21:48:37 Trump and his cronies just want oil prices to go up -- they most likely also don't care if war breaks out, or who it hurts.  Oil prices up? Their work is done.
1410 2018-05-08 21:48:37 Made a big batch of my growth oil today with a few new goodies added. I'm excited to see the results!
1411 2018-05-08 21:48:34 Margaritaville is for real one of my favorite songs - all of those tourists covered in oil. Somepeople claim... but Buffett KNOWS it's his own damn fault!! Thats a REALman right there!!!!
1412 2018-05-08 21:48:33 Stupid cultists won’t snap out of their trance until they get hit in the pocketbook (or their kids get shipped out).  Iran is a major oil producer, and the price is already headed up.  Maybe tRump and his insider buddies will benefit from this?
1413 2018-05-08 21:48:31 He did it right before summer travel season too. High gas prices will hit, then a news report about “Travel is down” will hit. Then he will announce he wants to drill for more oil in the rural areas that voted for him. This will benefit his oil friends and take a swipe at Obama.
1414 2018-05-08 21:48:30 Oil slick coming out of a roundabout by the park. On the on hand, slid about 10 feet. On the other, the oil somewhat ameliorated the road rash.
1415 2018-05-08 21:48:24 Kurdistan Region must stop providing oil for "Israel". That revenue is financing further Israeli Bombing of the Region. Sell that oil to other allies.. You'll easily find new clients with Korea..

1418 2018-05-08 21:48:10 Kindly do educate, been trying to understand it for a while. Thought it was gas and oil but other countries are tops.
1419 2018-05-08 21:47:59 Don't confuse digital crypto with all this bitcoin and bitcoin derivative cryptocurrencies. Yes, Russia, Iran, Venezuela work on digital crypto but have little but name in common with bitcoin. They are usually backed by fiat, oil or gold.
1420 2018-05-08 21:47:53 Latest comments from Mnuchin's briefing are very important: "Without commenting on specifics, we have had various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset this." #OOTT #IranDeal #oil
1421 2018-05-08 21:47:47 اى أمثله زى ال depression ,essential oil  المميزات والعيوب والاستخدامات كدا يعنى المهم الكلام العام مش شرط الشرح الل تحت العناوين
1422 2018-05-08 21:47:32 Lol idk about that I could see you doing oil changes 
1423 2018-05-08 21:47:29 Excuse me who do you think controls gass prices?  Those oil companies are owned and operated by REPUBLICANS I understand trumpets believe all Democrats are to blame for everything from childbirth to death but think again! They raise the prices because they are allowed to.
1424 2018-05-08 21:47:28 we will start from there. you got oil?
1425 2018-05-08 21:47:14 Keep checking those oil prices they will go up stocks will tank
1426 2018-05-08 21:47:13 Of course they are anti USA! It goes back to the CIA leading a coupe d’etat in 1953, when you overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh because he nationalized Iran’s oil. The USA then put the Shah in charge as a brutal dictator. Your simple mind needs an education!
1427 2018-05-08 21:46:58 I think they usually use oil but whatever gets you relaxed my good dude
1428 2018-05-08 21:46:45 Oil spill in clean up, roadway reduced to one lane in #Adams on I-76 EB at I-25, stopped traffic back to Pecos St, delay of 11 mins
1429 2018-05-08 21:46:37 Any recipe that calls for oil i replace it with butter when baking. It comes out wayyy better..
1430 2018-05-08 21:46:37 Sounds like oil wrestling 
1431 2018-05-08 21:46:23 Yes, we hope so too. We also hope that the CEO of Skansi Offshore can see the tragic irony of calling for #sustainability whilst specialising in supplying offshore oil and gas platforms, likely the most unsustainable and polluting industry in the world. #takethefirststep
1432 2018-05-08 21:46:23 Do not ignore this. 1/3 of Borneo's beautiful wild orangutans, as pictured here, will be wiped out by 2020. Human's are the reason. Read ingredients & Ban all products with palm oil, you don't need it-Orangutans do #banpalmoil #bannutella #banpepsi #bannestle
1433 2018-05-08 21:46:22 And meat does not. Neither does red sauce. Only olive oil sauce, cheese, fruit, and veggies forever. Unless it's dessert pizza and then cinnamon and icing and sugar are allowed too.
1434 2018-05-08 21:46:21 If I was Japan and I watched America totally against war even add their allies are crushed I'd think perhaps destroying Pearl would be all that was needed. Can't say for sure though but the oil embargo was a big reason they bombed us and they were overconfident. Lots of evil then
1435 2018-05-08 21:46:18 Why isn't Trump investing in Solar if he truly wants us to be independent? Also, why would he change fuel standards if we wants us off foreign oil? That makes zero sense.
1436 2018-05-08 21:46:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, and back to work in their own country.
1437 2018-05-08 21:46:00 The pull out from the Paris Climate Accord is part of it, an intentional kick in the face to all who see the necessity of a clean environment & for their self $ gain: oil, gas. Debbie
1438 2018-05-08 21:46:00 Trump should not be allowed to leave the Iran deal until he describes what the deal is, how it benefits us, and how it has been working since it was implemented. He also should have to explain how leaving the deal will increased oil price & effect our economy. Bet you he can’t.
1439 2018-05-08 21:45:56 @JaredLeto Now thinking : ok, ok, Earth is fucked up, let's go to space or Mars. But in the case of fossil fuel crisis *soon ?*, will it be still possible to build rockets, and send them to space ? Can we even make/built anything without oil and its derivatives ? (＾_・)
1440 2018-05-08 21:45:55 It actually goes back to 1951, when mossadegh nationalized the oil company. British tried coup for two years, until US completed with the assistance of @CIA
1441 2018-05-08 21:45:47 1 question, why in the HELL would a son think about his mom’s nipples. Let alone rubbing oil on them. I mean hey, #oedipuscomplex much.  seriously though, there is a huge double standard that’s #gottogo #asap
1442 2018-05-08 21:45:41 We don't need their oil. He's that stupid.

1444 2018-05-08 21:45:27 I am way too proud of myself for getting an oil change for somebody who was supposed to get an oil change 6 months ago
1445 2018-05-08 21:45:24 Sprinkle them with spices of your choice and a little oil chuck em in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400.
1446 2018-05-08 21:45:14 It was the Obama administration that encouraged the Europeans to impose the sanctions that placed the oil embargo on Iran in the first place (against their economic interests). The Europeans agreed to the sanctions to fulfil an objective which the JCPOA successfully achieved.
1447 2018-05-08 21:45:11 If they are real scientists, I’m not sure what kind of math they’re doing, but to fill the huge role that fossil fuels provide to society now, renewables are minuscule in the whole. I’m talking transportation alone is 99.5% oil based, let alone electric.
1448 2018-05-08 21:45:09 Trump's decision will inflate oil and gas prices, experts say
1449 2018-05-08 21:45:06 I have to get another oil change?? Why is life so expensive 
1450 2018-05-08 21:45:05 @realDonaldTrump Dickwad only wants to make himself great. He always talked about the oil in Iran. He always talks about money. I feel the main reason he pulled out of the Iran deal is because Dickwad was not making money for himself on the oil. period. punto.
1451 2018-05-08 21:45:05 Price of oil rises to highest level in 4 years. Our pea-brained assclown @POTUS strikes again!
1452 2018-05-08 21:45:05 Fantasmas. Colectivistas, cabezas de fiérro. Liquidar la OIL Ya. Empresa Fantasma con trabajadóres mas fantásmas aún. Cooperativa. Vayan hacerse dar por el traste a Cuba, Venezuela o Vietnam.
1453 2018-05-08 21:44:49 Without the U.S., the deal now involves Iran, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and the European Union.

We were important tot he negotiations and this will cause those countries months or years of renegotiating but they are the most affected by Iranian Oil
1454 2018-05-08 21:44:48 I don't really know much about Iran, but it seems to me the Trump is just trying to manipulate oil prices higher.
1455 2018-05-08 21:44:29 Lol you mean you hooked up your boys for a high oil spike well played but let’s see what happens in two months how many voters start to flip because of your Iran deal... ps I would be surprised if Iran starts rebuilding
1456 2018-05-08 21:44:24 Bura math Mano Sir..u are taking up a lot of mind space with th 1M views on the video..they will make you a rapist, anti-national cause of poverty/high oil price.ignore them..great job
1457 2018-05-08 21:44:24 Well we know you’re not big on science but there’s no scientific evidence that CBD oil can be extracted from hops. The AG’s asinine statements are simply due to asinine laws that have kept CBD oil illegal in most cases.
1458 2018-05-08 21:44:22 No again

The best chance to save the United Kingdom is stopping Brexit.

Scots will vote for independence.

Without London’s financial sector, Tech & Aerospace, probably car industry. Add in no access to Scottish oil, clean energy and water. How long before even Wales says tata

1463 2018-05-08 21:43:43 Trump's campaign spiel "we should of took the oil" is coming to fruition. Between Bolton's cry of a regime change, Netanyahu's 2001 WMD PowerPoint, & Trump dropping the Iran deal, the foundation has been laid for war. 

Someone call Susan Sarandon, let her know she fucked us.
1464 2018-05-08 21:43:38 Israel's going to bomb the crap out of Iran and Russia's going to take them over, and their oil. Hundreds of thousands of Iranian people will die and 45 will blame it all on President Obama and Hillary.
1465 2018-05-08 21:43:37 .@WSMV When you’re teasing a piece about hemp oil why are you showing a pot pipe and marijuana being lit? That’s completely misleading. Hemp ≠ marijuana.
1466 2018-05-08 21:43:35 They were very big bois (tm)

They were really, really good fried with some flour and sunflower oil!
1467 2018-05-08 21:43:34 Oil
1468 2018-05-08 21:43:24 Maybe not so much Saudi Arabia tho they seem interested in being a part of China's new oil futures market that is designed to exclude the USA
1469 2018-05-08 21:43:17 Also, the price of oil will go up. Another big win.
1470 2018-05-08 21:43:17 Lower taxes
Stronger military 
Higher wages
Korean war ended
Tough on illegal aliens 
Record low unemployment 
Manufacturering returning
Domestic oil production 
#Winning
1471 2018-05-08 21:43:12 This will do one thing oil prices will go up which will good for saudis make Israel happy they hate Iran and make Iran fall in the lap of China. Fox News lies destroy America sadly.
1472 2018-05-08 21:43:10 So that oil price which plumitted during the PC government years because of OPEC over production is the NDP fault then... That's a pretty amazing spin you tried there
1473 2018-05-08 21:42:48 Hi have you ever thought off trying nut oil to make the crisps x
1474 2018-05-08 21:42:46 Now more than ever we need to start drilling for oil and natural resources in our own backyard then be held hostage by the middle East.
1475 2018-05-08 21:42:44 If today's fluctuations in the price of oil don't convince you big players have an agenda best check yourself.
After hours trading reveals a lot
1476 2018-05-08 21:42:17 Russia absolutely has a lot to gain. More conflict->more oil consumption->more money.
1477 2018-05-08 21:42:17 So #Trump ends #NuclearDeal w #Iran. Oil (& gasoline) princes jupm. Who benefits? Could it be... oil companies? That donate to who? #followthemoney  @cnnhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-says-u-s-leaving-horrible-iran-nuclear-accord-1.3919848 @CTVNews
1478 2018-05-08 21:42:16 Thanks for the information @AO1379  But  FYI, Oil can never finish. If you doubt me watch the "origin of oil" on youtube. Waiting!!!

1480 2018-05-08 21:42:07 Being an adult is getting 30 bucks as a late birthday gift and immediately using it for an oil change
1481 2018-05-08 21:41:53 Newcastle are no different to any other club that makes up the numbers. Appreciate you don't like to hear that. @ManCity  & @ChelseaFC were no different either until oil / gas rich owners came along.
1482 2018-05-08 21:41:52 The very sad bit is that, that is true of all big industries. Oil, precious metals, finance etc. Apart from an incredible select few, almost all of the major players in these sectors are + 100 years old. Apart from tech new massive corps don't spawn.
1483 2018-05-08 21:41:50 'A deficit in the oil market' #skypapers. What the fuck is she talking about? OPEC is still trying to run the glut down and US shale is on the uptick again. #IranDeal. Dozy mare.
1484 2018-05-08 21:41:50 Trump's decision will inflate oil and gas prices, experts say
1485 2018-05-08 21:41:47 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
1486 2018-05-08 21:41:47 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1487 2018-05-08 21:41:39 Bet you he's lying to you. Big oil is his buddies. Watch it happen Joni Baloney.
1488 2018-05-08 21:41:38 If Obumer would have went to congress for treaty with Iran that was legitimate, Trump wouldn’t be cleaning up this crap “Deal” The EU will stay in for the oil. The US gets “0” oil from these terroists
1489 2018-05-08 21:41:36 Trim and use beard oil/balm.
1490 2018-05-08 21:41:35 I don't think it's so much the oil as the idea that Putin wants to step into the vacuum that will be created when and as, 45 continues to remove the United States as the stabilizing power in the world..45 is Putin's puppet, Putin's hand is so far up 45s ass he can work the mouth
1491 2018-05-08 21:41:30 Sad too...we have enough oil stored and available in this country to last a very long time
1492 2018-05-08 21:41:25 Not only that but America can just stop exporting oil of we really want. We been drilling and exporting oil like crazy here. Also if Iran tried that ha god bless them because it's over for them
1493 2018-05-08 21:41:25 Hi Kim Larsen. Your pizza with mushrooms and motor oil will be delivered in 29 min via truck.
1494 2018-05-08 21:41:23 Just think about a sudden and immediate shutdown of international oil markets for a few days, that would be insanely bad for our massive bubble economy
1495 2018-05-08 21:41:14 I make my own hair oil with .. sesame oil, olive oil, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, avocado oil, vitamin E oil, moroccan oil, and black castor oil
1496 2018-05-08 21:41:13 My argan oil will be arriving this evening. Thank you for your attention.
1497 2018-05-08 21:41:08 Agreed & the consequences are far reaching & potentially dangerous.
Just to spite Obama, Trump has alienated our allies, given Russia more power in Middle East, disrupted the flow of oil to Europe and proven to the world that the
U.S. can't be trusted to fulfill our agreements.
1498 2018-05-08 21:41:03 Walking away will isolate the US, not the Iranians. Pressure on the Iranians has always been most effective when the US was joined by others. In fact, it was only when the EU decided to impose a boycott on Iranian oil that Iran  truly felt squeezed.
1499 2018-05-08 21:40:52 Russia is going to isolate US, get US to fight a war for them, and then sell and buy oil with the rest of the world.
1500 2018-05-08 21:40:49 Olive oil is good ... I make my own hair oil with .. sesame oil, olive oil, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, avocado oil, vitamin E oil, moroccan oil, and black castor oil

1503 2018-05-08 21:40:30 For my new car the oil change went up a good 40$ 
1504 2018-05-08 21:40:29 It’s about oil prices.
1505 2018-05-08 21:40:28 “At 17 per cent of Alberta’s economy, the oil and gas sector remains the largest industry in the province, but its size relative to the overall economy has shrunk by more than 25 per cent since 1986. The oilsands only account for two per cent of Canada’s economy.”
1506 2018-05-08 21:40:27 Haven’t touched my system in 7 months

1507 2018-05-08 21:40:27 No iraq was destabilized even more
Literally the majority of Iraqis hate America now and their oil was stolen they were better off with Saddam heck look at Libya they got a slave trade
1508 2018-05-08 21:40:16 Higher oil prices, and a closer relationship with Iran, who can now negotiate a new deal that doesn't include us.
1509 2018-05-08 21:40:15 Idk what China would do, but it wouldn't be good. Iran is vv close to Russia tho. And yeah, a war with Iran would be the opposite of a cakewalk since they've got a large set of backers internationally and would shut down intl oil lanes for a few days at the straits of Hormuz

1512 2018-05-08 21:40:08 That and he also needs to impress Putin and help Russia however possible - even if it means higher oil prices in the US (which help Russia).
1513 2018-05-08 21:40:06 Rest assured Russia orchestrated much of what we are seeing, including the US’ diminishing as a world power. It’s not paranoia. There are trillions of dollars in oil at stake, not to mention power.
1514 2018-05-08 21:40:05 No, he said the war was a mistake repeatedly but since we were there take the oil to pay for the war.

1525 2018-05-08 21:39:21 Just to sum up the, the Iran Deal
- Let us export commercial goods to Iran for profit
- Let us purchase cheep oil from Iran
- Forced Iran to undergo surveillance of any/all nuclear sites
- Forced Iran to cease nuclear enrichment (needed for bombs)

1528 2018-05-08 21:39:17 I believe that at the core of the Coup Feb 2012 was MDP govts investigation of Yaameen AG role in the Burma Oil scandal. One of the first things  @DrWaheedH did after removing @MohamedNasheed was paying Grant&Thornton $6m to halt that investigation.
1529 2018-05-08 21:39:10 Who do higher oil prices help?   
Russia.
1530 2018-05-08 21:39:01 Oil prices dropped.
1531 2018-05-08 21:38:59 Water is oil.
1532 2018-05-08 21:38:57 interesting signaling with the US leaving the Iran nuclear deal, and recent Syrian airstrikes from the US and Israel. More oil games?
1533 2018-05-08 21:38:54 Confusion & disappointment of the #markets following the WH announcement appears as if people would rather appreciate a declaration of war, so that #oil prices would jettison along with energy #etfs leaving behind a world torn apart. #Dow #Trading $DJI $SPY $AAPL $FB $C $XLK $XLE
1534 2018-05-08 21:38:53 Imposing sanctions on Iran will drive up the price of oil and then lifting sanctions on Russia will allow them to open their gas station and make a lot of money.
1535 2018-05-08 21:38:52 I understand but was not stated.  The key element in the OPEC agreement is capex return to the oil fields.  This comes from KSA and is moving goal posts.  Very unlikely they can sustain over a 0.5mbd increase.
1536 2018-05-08 21:38:51 How can this idiot say someone has palm oil instead of csf in their brain 
1537 2018-05-08 21:38:50 No Lisa, there is plenty of oil in the world the more you sell the cheaper it gets
1538 2018-05-08 21:38:47 she needs an oil blotting sheet so bad
1539 2018-05-08 21:38:38 Land? Who wants land? Iran's oil isn't needed that's why it can be included in sanctions.  Why doesn't Nigeria suffer sanctions? It has oil and land.
1540 2018-05-08 21:38:36 selling water, via pipeline, to the US South West would be a winner too, water we got, water is safe, (as are pipelines), the need for water down there is greater than that of oil. location I hear you say? 200 metres offshore using welded rubber flex pipe, no digging, easy yes?

1542 2018-05-08 21:38:33 Hence why he wants western countries to lose control of Middle Eastern oil 

So Russia can compete

1544 2018-05-08 21:38:28 Heavy industry is way up..so demand for oil is up. You’re not a thinker

1550 2018-05-08 21:37:53 This is about the price of oil, nothing more nothing less. 
Who Benefits ? ... follow the money.
1551 2018-05-08 21:37:40 The sanctions are only gonna hurt the normal people of Iran 

There is no nuclear weapon in Iran 

It’s about OIL
1552 2018-05-08 21:37:39 #DonaldTrump "Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran. The people of America stand with you."

Not like in 1953, when we overthrew your elected leader, installed our own preferred one and grabbed  your oil.

We're better than that, now...
1553 2018-05-08 21:37:38 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts grape seed oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part almond butter. Add blue cheese crumbles and molasses to taste.
1554 2018-05-08 21:37:38 Can we start dumping our spent motor oil on the ground too? for being happy about trashing the Earth!
1555 2018-05-08 21:37:36 @realDonaldTrump has proven that you can’t trust any deal with the US. Not worth the paper it’s written on. Trump will sell out his nearest partners for oil dollars. US as any type of partner is not on. Can’t be trusted. North Korea be warned. #IranDeal #NorthKorea

1558 2018-05-08 21:37:15 Sam Elliott likes to be vocal with politics... “I thought about voting republican once. Then decided to buy book of Mormon, dump oil in a national park, and give all my money to a billionaire. Figured I’d cut out the middle man”...

1560 2018-05-08 21:37:13 Of course, I call it putting fire on oil and blaming the oil, people can live together in peace, it's politicians sold to lobbies arms and on who are playing the war games, unfortunately most people don't care about what happen behind their garden until it will cross towards them
1561 2018-05-08 21:37:12 @JeffFlake in case you haven’t heard #trump is following a deviant plan to further his $ and #Putin is the strategic master. The Saudi’s & #Qatar learned you must pay #TrumpCrimeFamily to stay in the oil business NOT country 1st! He does for his pocket #dictator to quote..1/2
1562 2018-05-08 21:37:10 AAA Oklahoma says reimposing sanctions on Iran likely to drive gas prices up. Speculation has already pushed crude oil up to $70/bbl. Gas prices are already up 45 cents over a year ago...national average could range between $2.80 to $3 by summer. @NEWS9
1563 2018-05-08 21:37:04 "I use plastics less and less"

So you use plastics.  Ergo you use oil. 

Cool story.  Does your hypocrisy know no bounds?
1564 2018-05-08 21:37:03 try getting some lavender oil and making a spray from it? ive been using that on all my windows and doors and potential entrances and so far no real signs of new ones
1565 2018-05-08 21:36:52 US and UK sacked Prime Minister Mosaddegh, who had nationalized oil industries to benefit Iran’s citizens, and propped up Shah Pahlavi, seen mostly as an oppressive imposter. Today’s Middle East mess is largely of our own making.
1566 2018-05-08 21:36:41 this is trumps way of tossing oil biz to his American buddies. and yes the price will go up, but his friends will be making the $ this time.
1567 2018-05-08 21:36:34 We don't buy any oil from Iran.
1568 2018-05-08 21:36:23 ... except that we do, by all measures, actually know that. Yes they could be hiding it somehow, but dropping our end of that bargain doesn't improve the situation in any way and only makes it worse for everyone.. except other oil producing nation's.
1569 2018-05-08 21:36:22 #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA is Dawn dishwashing liquid the official sponsors for the animal cleanups during oil spills?
1570 2018-05-08 21:36:17 I'm not a huge fan of the look as it, IMHO, appears irresponsible. Now, I've taken pictures of my guns surrounded by all the booze in my house to prove a point about stupid laws, but generally speaking I avoid carrying & drinking.
1571 2018-05-08 21:36:16 Don't like skyrocketing oil prices? Thank the ahole in the DC. Hurts lower income the most, basically a tax increase because gas is such a necessity. This then takes away from consumer spending on goods Terrible for the retail & grocery sectors. I analyze retail data for a living
1572 2018-05-08 21:36:16 Iran sits on a sea of oil and gas but needs Nuclear power plants. Right...ok..sure. #Morons
1573 2018-05-08 21:36:09 I was wondering if he is applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle here... Either way, this is a dangerous precedent. A future US administration unfriendly to oil & gas can also exercise its right to "correct a past mistake" and revoke all LNG export permits, for example.
1574 2018-05-08 21:35:49 Lol
What if she comes out and says the two of you never had a thing.
Who would we now believe? 
1575 2018-05-08 21:35:43 BS  Israel does not need American men to protect it. If the U.S. Gets involved it will be to protect the big oil  countries,  which is ALWAYS the reason we get ourselves involved.
1576 2018-05-08 21:35:18 Trump will have gas over $3.50 a gallon by July. GOP will push pipelines, fracking, Arctic drilling...everything on Big Oil's agenda. Meanwhile, average Americans will see anything they gained in short term from #GOPTaxScam disappear.

We WILL find out !!
1581 2018-05-08 21:35:05 #OOTT Also note going forward in the coming weeks Iran will heavily discount its oil to India and China and trade in rupees and yuan...so that it will undercut and harm US exports .. The persians did that in the previous sanctions.

1583 2018-05-08 21:34:57 It’s war generation parents that has been passed down. They would get American cheese from army surplus. Unsure if it was to supplement nutrition but it makes sense they would do that. I grew up with American cheese on rice with soy sauce and sesame oil.

1585 2018-05-08 21:34:43 I've no issue with fracking as an extraction process, but the oil needs to stay in the ground for the climate's sake.
1586 2018-05-08 21:34:29 So, we mop up our own oil spills until the next administration, huh? #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
1587 2018-05-08 21:34:26 Your percentages do not matter since the rethuglicon party supports BIG OIL.
1588 2018-05-08 21:34:25 Old man, you should invest your silver dollars on New York Railroad Company and Standard Oil  that’s more of your pace
1589 2018-05-08 21:34:25 thank you will call other African leaders on the Iran deal Oil prices go up a win win not for the people but for our pockets
1590 2018-05-08 21:34:23 But large part of world does get oil from iran, who will have to get it else where, which will make your oil cost more. Economics not trump or his 
supporters strong subject.

1592 2018-05-08 21:34:11 Houston's population of older wealthy fat white oil guys are obstinate to change. They may not be the majority of the population (probably close though), but they have the money to influence, & are ALSO some of the politicians that give zero fucks about your bike.
1593 2018-05-08 21:33:58 Crude Oil, Gold Prices Look to Powell and Trump for Direction
1594 2018-05-08 21:33:53 Fuel Prices will go up !. Once the Europeans, Russians and China show that they will continue to but oil from Iran, It would be very, very foolish to try and prevent countries to buying oil form Iran. Had you though about that Ditto ?
1595 2018-05-08 21:33:52 If given the chance your father would approve oil pipes there too like most national parks here too
1596 2018-05-08 21:33:49 Will a side effect be that the price of oil goes up? Hmm
1597 2018-05-08 21:33:43 I take shots for my oil painting. Sometimes I get lucky! Follow me on Instagram at                                  @artandarchaeology
1598 2018-05-08 21:33:41 An interesting aside: Neocon war drums are beating for War with Iran, just as they were a decade-and-a-half ago for Iraq.... but this time, the oil price spike accompanying another oil war is bound to finally force even resolute fossil fuel users into renewable energy sources.
1599 2018-05-08 21:33:36 And want to provide big oil profits to Russia when Iran sanctioned again.
1600 2018-05-08 21:33:28 The Tucson Sunrise Rotary Club would like to thank Barrio Bread, Kneaders Bakery and Cafe and Alfonso Gourmet Olive Oil and Balsamics for supporting "The Nights of a Thousand Stars" fundraiser.
1601 2018-05-08 21:33:22 Iran needed NUCLEAR energy because they didn’t have any OTHER energy source like, say,......oil.
If it looks like a skunk, walks like a skunk, and smells like a skunk, uh,  guess what?
1602 2018-05-08 21:33:20 Oil, cash, Israel, proximity and influence on Europe. Yep, the Middle East.
1603 2018-05-08 21:33:18 Why is it we condem countries like Iran who's citizens don't pay tax.. free health care.. where do they get there money. Ooo federal owned oil... If only we had a way of taxing companies in Australia
1604 2018-05-08 21:33:16 Watch the #StockMarket today! #POTUS withdrawing from the #IranNukeDeal probably caused stocks to react negatively. In addition, watch #oilprices sky rocket. Once oil prices are high, oil companies want to sell more of their oil. High demand and high profit potential drive it.
1605 2018-05-08 21:33:09 Oh please! Addiction to oil or opiates is human behavior with consequences we aren't paying for directly. There is direct correlation.
1606 2018-05-08 21:33:04 Oil price has spiked quite nicely as well which should stop Putin having to scratch around down the back of the sofa for some loose change.
1607 2018-05-08 21:33:01 CEO'S that have already moved their investments to cheaper jurisdictions. And its better for them to support a carbon tax to shut us down rather than have discount cdn oil on the world market. Only cdns are that dumb to believe this crap.

#frackoff
1611 2018-05-08 21:32:35 People at least acknowledge the crimes of Saudi, but BiBi has been taking the piss for years and it goes completely unchecked because he hides behind Israel. I reckon he pushed this to cut off funding to Assad so he can move in on the Golan Heights and exploit the oil/water
1612 2018-05-08 21:32:31 I’m seeing 5% of world oil comes from Iran.
1613 2018-05-08 21:32:27 Apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and honey mustard the bestttttttttttttt salad dressing omg
1614 2018-05-08 21:32:23 It's also about oil. Gas prices are up and will skyrocket now. Trump and his cronies are raping America right now. Oil tycoons and investors are and will make mega billions if not trillions of dollars. Trump is getting hella kickbacks. He does nothing if it's not about
1615 2018-05-08 21:32:21 Okay. I’m right at 3k and didn’t know what to do lol I read the owners manual and it said something like oil change at 3k for some and 5k for others. So I’ve been wondering ... am I an other? 
1616 2018-05-08 21:32:20 So the internships that he is giving to the top 4 dont matter? Plus he is buying artwork from another contestant who did an oil painting of him. Non of the designers are complaining. But all that dont matter lets bash AKA
1617 2018-05-08 21:32:12 It's all well and good if you're sat in the boozer on a hot day but if you're working in the blazing heat covered in engine oil and the strong smell of cow shit passing by it just puts a negative perspective on the British weather
1618 2018-05-08 21:32:09 it just wasn't affordable for me , I have an oil heater I uses sparingly but gas heaters chew up gas like nothing on earth
1619 2018-05-08 21:32:09 these twitter snake oil salesman are hilarious. you dont honestly believe a career CBOE finance professional of nearly 3 decades was paying $100/month to a twitter stranger who sold "insider information" do you???
1620 2018-05-08 21:32:02 .....but this isn’t subverting democracy. It would be if the Lord Chancellor, or another oil on the wool sack, decided to bomb Syria.
But do you think there should be a red line drawn against chemical attacks on your own citizens or not. That is a debate.
1621 2018-05-08 21:32:01 Trump has never paid for his own gas. He doesnt care. It doesn't apply or affect him in anyway. So he doesn't care or he'll look at it as an excuse to go bomb Iran to take their oil. Either way, we're screwed
1622 2018-05-08 21:31:59 Esso oil industry.
1623 2018-05-08 21:31:50 You are all complicit in murders of innocent people for oil!
1624 2018-05-08 21:31:46 You sound like the dips that thought we could just take Iraq's oil after we invaded. The world doesn't work that way it's against the law. Laws we agreed to and expect others to as well.
1625 2018-05-08 21:31:45 Valid point.
1626 2018-05-08 21:31:35 How much did you invest in oil and gasoline stocks, this week or months past, @LindseyGrahamSC ?

1630 2018-05-08 21:31:08 Perhaps you are concerned about an increase in oil prices, president Trump and I am concerned about Iran developing nuclear capabilities.

1651 2018-05-08 21:29:21 Too bad for Pence-Trump that Europe and China will honor the agreement, buy Iranian oil, and continue to ensuring that Iran abide by the deal.  The only ones rejoicing are the Islamic dictatorship in Saudi Arabia and the Israelis.

1657 2018-05-08 21:28:50 Quit making up fake stories. Russia LOVES that we're pulling out of the Iran deal. They make their money off oil, if Iran can't trade oil it means Russia can sell more of their oil. Gee, who benefits in that situation? Oh right, RUSSIA! But please, keep making up fake narratives.
1658 2018-05-08 21:28:46 somewhere right now..  negotiations for that oil in exchange for Uranium are been made....  congratulations America You played yourselves.

1664 2018-05-08 21:28:27 what are the criterions of an ideal world? is it preventing other countries to develop their technologies or to lay claim to protect their oil or to object  usa to stay independent  ? iran has certainly right to develop its own nuclear technology just like usa does.
1665 2018-05-08 21:28:24 Alberta’s economy is heavily tied to oil prices. When oil prices go down, as they previously have, the economy suffers. Not hard to figure that out.
1666 2018-05-08 21:28:22 Worst Russian agent ever. America has also boosted oil and gas production which Russia hates because their economy is completely dependent on exporting it.
1667 2018-05-08 21:28:22 Yep! Look at oil stocks since he announced it! SMH
1668 2018-05-08 21:28:18 Oil prices will go up & Iran could go back to being a nuclear state  do they care? nope. Not to mention N Korea is seeing this and they just saw what happen to Iran I will not be surprise that right now they're having 2nd thoughts, cause the US has a Pres that can't be trusted.

1676 2018-05-08 21:27:52 and last years report says Alberta got close to %2 in royalties on their oil resources. The USA oil companies got %98 for free with tax breaks as well.
1677 2018-05-08 21:27:46 It leaves America isolated, weakens Europe, and drives up the price of oil. Can't see why Putin would mind any of those things.

~J. Paul Getty
1680 2018-05-08 21:27:42 There is no evidence that Iran supports any terror groups, however Saudi Arabia seems to fund all of them. Including the 911 terrorists. The price of oil will increase, so you have that

1682 2018-05-08 21:27:38 1. Glad we agree not to listen to pelosi. 
2. Stick market was down, and unemployment was at 10%. Gas prices are going up not because of trump, but because obama decided rather than america producing for herself, theyd buy saudi oil. Ontop of shitty carbon taxes.
1683 2018-05-08 21:27:31 TFW you don't realize higher crude helps out American oil and gas companies...

1687 2018-05-08 21:27:09 Israelis seem worried that hostilities will increase between them & Iranian proxies in Syria. More war can up the oil price.
1688 2018-05-08 21:27:03 Not necessarily iran deal isn't a huge deal to russia it increases oil prices so its a mixed bag and forces Iran to build even closer relations with russia to avoid impact and remember Trump helping Iran/russia in Syria and Iraq are a bigger deal
1689 2018-05-08 21:26:55 U probably killed the most amount of innocents as well. Destroyed countries like Iraq just for their oil. Drop a nuclear bomb on innocents, (a record only country to use a nine in combat)  and now u dont want anyone else to have nukes cus ur scared?
1690 2018-05-08 21:26:50 … but you know, oil prices will go up because of this so campaign funding (and possibly other of @realDonaldTrump’s investments) will also go up.
1691 2018-05-08 21:26:33 Ooh pumpkin seed oil is really tasty. It's a dark almost brownish green, strongly flavoured. I don't cook with it but it's good on salads and for vinaigrette.
1692 2018-05-08 21:26:31 I actually avoid ALL palm oil and support charities replanting forests. Way to go to put the ass into assumption though...
1693 2018-05-08 21:26:30 yes, but it’s more than ego.

1711 2018-05-08 21:24:30 Trump is just doing what the Kochs and the industrial war machine tell him to do. The Kochs want all public land opened to oil companies and the other wants a war. If Trump does as they say, the GOP congress they control will continue covering up Trumps corruption.
1712 2018-05-08 21:24:26 Oh god the oil slick is that digesting goop that lived on that lake right? That shit gave me nightmares.
1713 2018-05-08 21:24:26 Tech is making oil cheaper n that’s a problem for countries who are overly dependent on oil for revenue. That’s why they need the price above $100/barrel. i.e (cough) war (cough).
1714 2018-05-08 21:24:19 Why isn’t he working on the pipeline dispute..... oh forgot..... he doesn’t want it built , stall tactic. Would rather buy dirty oil from countries that exploit women and no environmental standards. What a disgrace he is to Canada 
1715 2018-05-08 21:24:13 All we need is an oil embargo and an American embassy in Iran.

1720 2018-05-08 21:23:38 Let's wait and see. I think API got products wrong.
1721 2018-05-08 21:23:28 Don't know but there would be some increase as the oil prices are already on the rise. Around $78 right now
1722 2018-05-08 21:23:28 Is and it has always been about OIL not Nukes! Read your history there Sparky! Israel is incidental since 1948 when they became the parasite of the MiddleEast due to a UK screw up and now on the US dime and scared as fuck of KSA Syria and IRAN.
1723 2018-05-08 21:23:28 Forget About Oil. Alberta is Poised to Become the Province of Marijuana -
1724 2018-05-08 21:23:07 So this means everyone will pump more oil right?
1725 2018-05-08 21:22:56 Most likely Saudi Arabia OPEC and USA will make up the difference that Iran no longer pumps into the market. And most likely that Iran oil will still go to China. Only Europe with Russia will have major issues.
1726 2018-05-08 21:22:54 I'm nothing but an erring human...
May Alan 4give me
1727 2018-05-08 21:22:51 This the same US that used the CIA to overthrow the democraticly elected Iran government and replace it with a nutjob dictator in exchange for access to Iranian oil?How about this meesage for the people, im sorry we screwed up your country to try to make ourselves even richer
1728 2018-05-08 21:22:49 If the other nations stay in the Iran deal and Iran stays in it won’t the US be the only country that can’t do inspections?
Won’t US cos. lose markets for their products?
Won’t US gas prices go up because we can’t use Iranian oil ? Oh that’s right we’ll buy Putin oil?
1729 2018-05-08 21:22:48 A wise women once told me squeakiest wheel gets most "oil" remember that Everton fans always remember that. @Evertonvmad
1730 2018-05-08 21:22:47 ...we can continue this logic.A crisis in the Middle East does not only cut off Iran from oil markets,but reduces global oil supply and therefore increases oil prices across the board-helping US oil production that needs high prices to be profitable.America first!
1731 2018-05-08 21:22:43 Good news is the Iranian oil crisis wasn't a thing that lead to full and total collapse of the Middle East. So there's that.
1732 2018-05-08 21:22:41 @CNBCFastMoney oil goes up when gop is in office.
1733 2018-05-08 21:22:40 that might be a good point.  since the highest earners are from the east (oil patch workers) or live on site months of the time, much of their income might be spent on travelling to get away from the job.
1734 2018-05-08 21:22:39 What oil are you using?
1735 2018-05-08 21:22:39 Mmm, coconut oil & lavender would smell lovely 
1736 2018-05-08 21:22:37 I remember the Oil Embargo against the United States & it's impact. We are not immune from economic sanctions being imposed on us by China & other economic leaders. We need them, their industry, labor, stability & investments more than they need us or @realdonaldtrump.
1737 2018-05-08 21:22:18 I wear so much peppermint oil I can’t even smell it anymore.
1738 2018-05-08 21:22:16 Suddenly, gun oil on the nipples is unattractive?
1739 2018-05-08 21:22:15 I'm sure the 500,000 barrels PER DAY of Iranian oil that Europe relies on has nothing to do with it. #conflictofinterests
1740 2018-05-08 21:22:13 Not only will greater instability ensue, which this administration is not well positioned to deal with as they have dismantled 35% of the State Department, oil prices will rise. On the bright side, green initiatives will become more realistic to pursue. Melania likes the Obamas.,
1741 2018-05-08 21:22:11 There goes the #Iran deal !
oil prices jump through the roof and all war hawks in the US are so happy!
1742 2018-05-08 21:21:57 @badassbeardcare I a huge baseball fan and I love how a baseball smells. What do you think about making a leather sent oil and balm?
1743 2018-05-08 21:21:54 It really does have the elements of 1973--big deficits, foreign oil crises, interest rates too low--and we're not in a good spot to reverse it.
1744 2018-05-08 21:21:50 Watch the price of oil go up!

#IranDeal
1745 2018-05-08 21:21:48 Teatree oil everyday!
1746 2018-05-08 21:21:42 API has always been a toss and it's numbers are basically useless.  It is good for a day and forgotten unlike the EIA. Not sure why would the Saudis reduce imports at such higher prices..:)
1747 2018-05-08 21:21:36 So thanks to @realDonaldTrump I can expect to be paying over 3$ a gallon heading into the summer! That’s what real diplomacy looks like. Giving an oil exporting nation higher oil prices... Iran must be thrilled.
1748 2018-05-08 21:21:35 Love working on my motorcycle, it’s so relaxing. Even something simple like changing the oil or installing a new battery. Motorcycles are just so cool man 
1749 2018-05-08 21:21:31 You're making the mistake of thinking there is only ever one reason for doing things. You seem to forget North Africa through to Persia is also a major oil bearing region. If successful the Germans would have connected up their two targets.
1750 2018-05-08 21:21:26 XBSKNDDKFNKDBD cover me with OIL
1751 2018-05-08 21:21:23 Who likes higher oil prices?
1752 2018-05-08 21:21:18 @COPLinvestor I can see NNPC approval before the end of H1 2018; therefore something’s gotta give in the next 8 weeks; tick tock  oil at $75; makes OPL226 a company transformer!
1753 2018-05-08 21:21:16 It’s super safe lol I think he just like the taste of the peppermint oil
1754 2018-05-08 21:21:12 Oil?
1755 2018-05-08 21:21:12 Yup oil rich Iran needs nuclear power. You’re not really that naive are you?
1756 2018-05-08 21:21:08 Mix it with a tiny little bit of coconut or olive oil in lieu of petroleum products and you should be good to go. :)
1757 2018-05-08 21:21:07 Start war. Take oil.

I feel like he has been REALLY specific on this point.
1758 2018-05-08 21:21:02 That's what I'm saying. The Saudis did that on purpose knowing this is the week of Trump's stupid Iran Deal nonsense. The Saudis want 80 to be the norm. They'll do any dirty trick to get it. Watch some stupid no-substance "omg SA geopolitical risk" thing happen before June.
1759 2018-05-08 21:21:01 I just find it amusing that 20 years ago, and until the US had an actual terrorist attack on their doorstep they were happy to ignore their allies problems. But are happy to wade into Middle East problems. Can't think why...*cough* oil *cough*
1760 2018-05-08 21:21:00 I buy Reynolds wrap but it is coconut oil Pam.
1761 2018-05-08 21:20:54 It’s weird, the Koch brothers announce they’re going to spend $400 million on the 2018 primaries and then Trump makes a policy decision that will guarantee oil prices rise and the Koch brothers make at least that $400 million back. Super weird how things happen.
1762 2018-05-08 21:20:39 Could be a alternative. We have been procrastinating about oil from Angola for a long time nothing practical/ physical yet to bee seen.
1763 2018-05-08 21:20:28 At Putin’s inauguration, Putin said this term will be focused on building Russia’s economy: oil prices closely linked & they will rise. He also hopes sanctions will be eased - this will help economy

1767 2018-05-08 21:20:19 New stadium will be a gamechanger. The atmosphere will be more intense and it will coincide with the town being busier due to the oil industry getting busier.
1768 2018-05-08 21:20:19 [5/8 5:20 pm] Went into Walmart today to pick up some motor oil and was quickly reminded why I don't go into Walmart except when I REALLY need to.
1769 2018-05-08 21:20:15 Nikiforuk blames end consumers for being energy hogs when that's all there is. I follow many other world gvm'ts and they are powering up in troves alternatives and have set long term goals. Misplaced tirade. Sloppy slug easy oil.
1770 2018-05-08 21:20:14 ... because they stopped selling oil in dollars, or at least they’d planned to. It is the pattern.
1771 2018-05-08 21:19:52 for a kid raised by oil money you would think....oh wait no. nevermind.
1772 2018-05-08 21:19:50 Did Michelle have her head checked?...... did they change the oil? Made sure the fluids were topped off?....inquiring minds want to know.......
1773 2018-05-08 21:19:48 According to Israeli intelligence that @benshapiro cited, in 2015 Iran was beginning a nuclear weapons program. The JCPOA stopped that. US IC confirmed Iran has been in compliance. But Robert Mercer benefits from war and Putin from expensive oil, so Ben is against the JCPOA too.
1774 2018-05-08 21:19:48 Just a way to start a war with Iran and go after their Oil. Same lie as Bush. He hates Obama and just don't care about whats right
1775 2018-05-08 21:19:43 equities?  oil?  nude art?

1778 2018-05-08 21:19:34 America invaded Iraq to gain oil on the sly now watch Donald Trump invade Iran for the same thing as he’s withdrawn from the nuclear agreement bet they’re running out of that Iraqi oil #fuellightson
1779 2018-05-08 21:19:26 But America and China is powered by oil. America especially. 

Anyway, you want to look at it, it's more political than it is about actual climate change
1780 2018-05-08 21:19:23 “Bro go get yo oil changed”
1781 2018-05-08 21:19:22 USA withdrew from #IranDeal but the sanctions will take time to be imposed and executed on oil supplied from Iran, so the impact will take some time, agreed with you @KElmufti on this point !
1782 2018-05-08 21:19:21 Trump want to attack to Iran . It won't be for truth or justice. It will be to complete the great oil pipeline.
1783 2018-05-08 21:19:15 There’s no doubt Trump, his family, & friends are all heavily invested in oil! Actually add Putin to that mix, he’s made billions off of Russian oil until prices dropped, now they’re back because of #Dotard & that bonus he claims people got from #GOPTaxScam will be paying for gas
1784 2018-05-08 21:19:14 Allies warn oil prices will surge if Trump leaves Iran nuke deal. Trump is LONG on big ideas, but SHORT on details.
1785 2018-05-08 21:19:12 France has a big oil deal with them. Suddenly America doesn’t need allies. I hope they all boycott the USA. The GOP needs to have their Emperical desires put to rest wants and for all.

1790 2018-05-08 21:18:47 “Around the world, countries investing in renewable energies show that job growth in the sector far outstrips that of future oil, gas and mining sector opportunities”.
1791 2018-05-08 21:18:43 I was being sarcastic. Wasn't Treble in Oreo also supposed to speed up updates? They keep selling this snake oil.
1792 2018-05-08 21:18:38 Yeah.  They needed a NUCLEAR energy program because they didn’t have anything ELSE for energy, like.......uh, oil.
You actually CAN fool some of the people ALL of the time.
1793 2018-05-08 21:18:35 I hate when they say they have got nothing from this, they have lotted the all resources they have take all the gold from middle east they attacked they have taken over all oil reserves they have taken over nation bu nations made them slaves all because saudis on their back
1794 2018-05-08 21:18:34 That is a pressing issue, but you're making it seem like the person bought a lifetime supply of Oreos which would be more drastic than eating a couple that was purchased and presented by the professor. Save your energy for people who purchase and consume items containing palm oil
1795 2018-05-08 21:18:28 Keep thinking Iran effects Americas oil prices
1796 2018-05-08 21:18:18 Tried to go all in with my 401k stocks on oil/fuel today. They laughed and said no! #MAGA #comeswithaprice
1797 2018-05-08 21:17:59 Is there non stick aluminum foil? I use Coconut oil Pam.
1798 2018-05-08 21:17:53 Who is the immediate beneficiary of threatening the nation that controls 25% of world oil reserves?
1799 2018-05-08 21:17:51 Think about why Russia wanted him to win election. The single biggest threat to Putin,  and his minions was the Iran deal. It flooded the market with oil, and drained their pockets. Thanks big d better hope thats not all they wanted from ya.
1800 2018-05-08 21:17:48 So what does withdrawing from Iran deal mean?  Higher gas prices (oil lobby happy).  America isolated from the world (Trump supporters happy).  Possible Armaggedon in the Middle East (Christian fundamentalists happy).  Nice how things work out for the "best."
1801 2018-05-08 21:17:39 All these Oil Rich Countries and all of Africa needs to ditch the US dollar.
1802 2018-05-08 21:17:38 Every time i get an oil change they be shook @ how low my mileage is. Sis i don’t go nowhere  lmao
1803 2018-05-08 21:17:38 Bibi Netanyahu has a major influence over Drumpf & Jared on this decision. Russia benefits greatly in the fact that oil prices are rising so are their profits. Pretty much circumventing any sanctions on them. Win-win for the war mongers. Total loss for people who want peace.
1804 2018-05-08 21:17:36 Oil
1805 2018-05-08 21:17:35 I am guessing there was a huge drop in imports w/w.
1806 2018-05-08 21:17:34 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1807 2018-05-08 21:17:32 I went on a tour to Gokana LGA in Ogoni and the Rainfall was purely black, the community name is Bera which house alot of Oil Well.
1808 2018-05-08 21:17:28 BTW, oil is up $2 since your president made his stupid announcement. He’s really taking care of you.
1809 2018-05-08 21:17:26 Can someone explain to me why I’m craving Italian bread dipped in olive oil 
1810 2018-05-08 21:17:21 Or the price of oil is about to rise along with Russia's petroleum sales.
1811 2018-05-08 21:17:20 Plus the Saudi’s have clearly stated they want oil prices to hover right around $80 per barrel!
1812 2018-05-08 21:17:11 It's all about the oil. He just wants to steal the rights for his buddies
1813 2018-05-08 21:17:07 That creep, Murphy, just comes across as a snake oil salesman 

1814 2018-05-08 21:17:03 Yes he wants endless war; that will create more jobs at Boeing, Lockheed Martin etc and we'll need more oil for Big Oil top execs' salaries. So he'll be a hero for creating jobs & more wealth for top 1% execs. Also he's doing what Putin tells him to do
1815 2018-05-08 21:16:54 Oil price are up.  There is nothing that helps Putin more....
1816 2018-05-08 21:16:51 I’ve been making the most bomb oil mixes for my diffuser . Definitely been underutilizing my pine needle and ylang ylang oils .
1817 2018-05-08 21:16:41 Oil prices. He's businessman and can smell money.
1818 2018-05-08 21:16:40 You use Bio oil instead of a body cream
1819 2018-05-08 21:16:36 It's really all about the oil. US Energy companies are going to rake in on this.

US is set to become the top energy producer in the world now.
1820 2018-05-08 21:16:31 A muted response so far from markets. I guess Ben Netanyahu telegraphed Trump's intention last week. Either the dollar or oil are due for reversal
1821 2018-05-08 21:16:30 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to supporting the stability of oil markets after the U.S. decision to withdraw from Iran nuclear deal, state-run SPA reports, citing a statement issued by an official in the energy ministry.

1822 2018-05-08 21:16:26 Fair enough, Europe being full electric is a half truth as most of their laws and industries still run on oil, select few nations have actually made any effort towards electric industrialisation let alone making the switch to electric in urban areas. Climate change goes...
1823 2018-05-08 21:16:24 I think that is part of the plan, to raise fuel prices, and for America to get their hands on some of Iran’s oil.
1824 2018-05-08 21:16:13 Great leggings made at Sunday's workshop along with some lovely oil cloth bags today. We still have a couple of places left on our beginners patchwork throw workshop starting on Tuesday!
1825 2018-05-08 21:16:09 Bebe is an a-hole, Trump is a dotard
I'm sick & tired of our American soldiers being puppets in Middle East wars without a Constitutionally required war authorization AND when the "wars" are profit makers 4 oil companies & billionaire KOCH Mercer investors of military/war mfg.
1826 2018-05-08 21:16:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet then never left.
1827 2018-05-08 21:15:58 Yes I agree WTI reacted quickly.. Iran should’ve stuck to the Asians it makes a lot more sense anyways just put pipelines and push your oil and gas that way.. if only life was that simple 
1828 2018-05-08 21:15:50 That would require planning and imagination. Sorry, that is not in this president’s toolkit. But if it raises oil prices to boost the Russian economy, hey it must be great!
1829 2018-05-08 21:15:49 So I get home late and I have to get up early and study tomorrow so let’s take a quick shower no? No actually I’ll soak my hair in olive oil and make this a an h 15 mins bath
1830 2018-05-08 21:15:45 Those wings without the fries... Though most wing sauce has all kinds of hidden stuff... Canola oil, maltodextrin, sugars... No bueno...
1831 2018-05-08 21:15:44 Keep dreaming and don't look for a man to build that oil and gas company together
1832 2018-05-08 21:15:44 Peppermint oil on after heat is amazing
1833 2018-05-08 21:15:25 No leadership over in the states. The constant lying, even on mundane things, makes me not believe ANYTHING that comes out of that WH. History has had many snake oil salesmen.
1834 2018-05-08 21:15:12 The oil change guy might have lied to me in order to get me to pay more but I don’t know enough to contradict him. There is so much in this scenario of which I am ashamed.
1835 2018-05-08 21:15:08 Yes, gas prices will go up. It's pretty much guaranteed! But there's no real good reason for it. Congress and the media will blame Trump as usual! But most of our oil comes from Canada. #ThingsYouLearnFromYourCanadianFriends
1836 2018-05-08 21:15:05 So interesting to see the US out for Iran not so long after they said they wouldn't use the US dollar for oil payments.
1837 2018-05-08 21:14:54 got oil all over my shorts
1838 2018-05-08 21:14:50 When the war comes and oil prices skyrocket, remember you wanted this.
1839 2018-05-08 21:14:47 If the United States puts sanctions on Iranian oil exports, it won’t be as effective as back in 2012, simply because there is not an agreement between the major powers — the U.S. and the EU — over implementing sanctions on Iran because of its nuclear program
1840 2018-05-08 21:14:46 Saudi ARAMCO wants to IPO this year, consumption is up c1.5 million barrels per day, IRAN deal now upended and sanctions to resume...sounds bullish for oil to me.
1841 2018-05-08 21:14:43 My freedom isn't in Iraq, oil is
1842 2018-05-08 21:14:42 Is Iran decided to be dicks about this. Trump should cut off access to the straight for oil delivery. Maybe we declare it contraband and take it until will reach the equal amount of $ Dumbass Obama gave them
1843 2018-05-08 21:14:40 US cannot stand it when an energy rich nations refuses to allow US companies to drain the profits from their oil/gas resources & uses like Libya, uses the profits to raise the living standards for their own people.

1845 2018-05-08 21:14:34 Yes, but the point is: why is a businessman at the forefront of this state ceremony? As far as I know, Gerhard Schroeder is chairman of an oil & gas company, I think Nordstrom. I'd say, too close for comfort.
1846 2018-05-08 21:14:24 API bullish. Distillate draw will be pump more premium into oil on water, if US can't supply others need to process. Tomorrow's open maybe look like Apr 18. Funds are shorter now. Bought more long dated MRO,HES,SN calls #OOTT #Crude
1847 2018-05-08 21:14:17 Sure, It is OK. All the money which they get from selling oil doesn't go for people but in the pocket of Hezbollah or Assad's regime to kill innocent people. To tell the truth, the Mollah's regime is a true monster.
1848 2018-05-08 21:14:13 Not gonna happen. ( I know you know) . The've been F'ck'd up for 5000 years ain't nothing we or anyone can do to change that. Unfortunately their region sits on the richest oil reserve on earth. A colossal monkey wrench for civilized western nations.
1849 2018-05-08 21:14:03 @eNCA  so the USA has decided to pull out of the #IranDeal. There are obviously so many concerns, the main one is the global economy.... we might see oil prices soaring leading to higher fuel prices. So much happening
1850 2018-05-08 21:14:01 And Putin scores another win as Trump pulls out of Iran Deal
1. puts another crack in NATO alliance
2. increases oil prices
3. weakens US influence in Middle East
I wish Trump's daddy had pulled out.
1851 2018-05-08 21:14:00 Bad News for India. Oil will go up again. We need some backchanneling with US for giving us exemption.
1852 2018-05-08 21:14:00 "Carthage must be destroyed."  

This dude is unhinged.  War at any cost.  I don't even think he is in it for the bankers or the oil.  A true believer in the rightness of his cause, like the Scottish Terrier on the other side of the fence who objects to me being in my own yard.
1853 2018-05-08 21:13:54 @POTUS I thought you wanted cheaper oil, but now thanks to you and your decisions we will all have to pay more for something that is left over everywhere.
1854 2018-05-08 21:13:53 The roundtable will definitely address many challenges facing oil sector in Nigeria.

God bless you @SPNigeria , @bukolasaraki .
1855 2018-05-08 21:13:52 Why increase the chance of nukes in the Middle East? Oh right, it raises the price of oil to help his buddies in Russia.
1856 2018-05-08 21:13:33 It will raise oil prices dramatically. Mission Accomplished. Plus the distraction factor.
1857 2018-05-08 21:13:33 Are we all excited to see Putin making billions of extra $$ from rising oil prices?
1858 2018-05-08 21:13:27 Well poor oil Burke’s come full circle  #nffc
1859 2018-05-08 21:13:27 Think about what will happen if oil prices rise to $200 a barrel. Think of the ramifications of that for a minute.
1860 2018-05-08 21:13:21 I watched a video earlier,  maybe conspiracy theory crap idk, linking it to the decision by Iran to deal oil in euros instead of dollars 

Wouldn't massively surprise me
1861 2018-05-08 21:13:14 And oil producers
1862 2018-05-08 21:13:09 If you remove #Iranian oil production, do you believe oil price can increase enough for US shale gas producers and Saoudie Arabia Aramco to share a BIG pie? #IranianNuclearDeal
1863 2018-05-08 21:13:08 Earth's climate changes every 25 years. And Europe has gone full electric while the rest of the world still depends on oil. 
They want want selective industrialization while hiding behind a systemic change. Hence, political
1864 2018-05-08 21:13:03 And since he has arranged for Russia to get a great big economic boost with their oil, encourage everyone to go electric, solar, wind and geothermal.  It's time to kick fossil fuels to the curb followed ASAP by @realDonaldTrump
1865 2018-05-08 21:13:00 The Iran Deal was NOT an Obama deal but the 2 year joint effort of our Allies.
But with nothing to show for all the "withdrawals " besides higher oil prices and higher healthcare cost.....
Using Obama's name seems to be the only wildcard to rile up the base.
1866 2018-05-08 21:12:58 #BREAKING Emirates & Saudi voice ready to up oil output if #Iran is forced out of market, #US Treasury Secretary says

1868 2018-05-08 21:12:28 You like $80 barrel oil, eh?
1869 2018-05-08 21:12:25 What’s his leverage now?   Dumbest strategy ever. Unless all he wants is:  increased oil prices, destabilization of NATO and the creation of annexation opportunities for Russia.  Wait a second...
1870 2018-05-08 21:12:23 I can't think of many dishes that Sunny and I don't add some sort of hot sauce or hot oil to.

My favourite would probably be a dallop of szechuan chili oil on top of a meaty rice dish. Just skim some of the chili oil for each bite I want more heat.
1871 2018-05-08 21:12:21 Russia exports more oil than any country other than Saudi Arabia. Destabilizing the Middle East is a gift from tRump to Putin.
1872 2018-05-08 21:12:21 Iran has control  of 1/5 of the world's oil...we might not get it directly but it will affect the world supplies.

1875 2018-05-08 21:12:18 Russian economy is dependent on oil sales. If Iran can’t sell oil, Russia benefits. Well done, Putin.
1876 2018-05-08 21:12:18 I call it "lose your big toe night"
1877 2018-05-08 21:12:17 I bet we find out that this Iran pull-out situation was because drumpf owed some oil tycoons a shit ton of money and an equal amount of favors - the USA is simply collateral damage.

1880 2018-05-08 21:12:04 What are you talking about?
Russia hopes the deal dies so they can stoke the fire and also earn more with their oil and gas. China wants peace so that oil would flow. And NATO is not a political party of it’s own.
1881 2018-05-08 21:11:50 API 1.7 million draw. How in god's good name it gets a draw? Unless we get a build in EIA tomorrow, a draw makes no sense. API has been decent in predicting draws/builds. I hope they're wrong :)

So if I like dump car oil in my backyard I could possibly get in trouble?
1883 2018-05-08 21:11:46 Trump want to fight a war with Iran.  It won't be for true or justice. It will be to complete the oil pipeline.
1884 2018-05-08 21:11:45 Bleach burns are the worst. Coconut oil helped with my scabbing.
1885 2018-05-08 21:11:45 John Kerry owns stock in 94 oil and gas companies @ the time he struck the deal. So with the deal, Iran is still building nukes and John Kerry and his oil buddies got rich. Doesn't sound too much like a deal does it. Screw the oil. I don't want to be killed by a nuke #pt2-2
1886 2018-05-08 21:11:39 Did you know #CHINA is the biggest importer of US oil? You would if you listen to @880thebiz right now for #TradingAfterHours
1887 2018-05-08 21:11:36 Tritek oil or some bifenthrin would work
1888 2018-05-08 21:11:32 Oh good, Tom. The Israelis took the bribe (more warplanes and $$) and the 9/11 perpetrators get a huge spike in oil prices. Meanwhile, we turn our backs on our NATO partners. Your boy has no plan beyond unwinding all things Obama.
1889 2018-05-08 21:11:26 .....the market. With the price of oil hovering around $70, it's not going to be long before they turn the faucet back on. That idiot saying Putin benefits is just wrong. We're selling oil and LNG to Europe now, which cuts his profit. He's getting pinched out and he knows it.
1890 2018-05-08 21:11:24 The Iranian oil industry will continue to develop even if the United States pulls out of the 2015 nuclear deal, and Tehran would see the accord as operational as long as it can sell oil, the Oil Ministry’s news service quoted senior officials as saying  @Reuters

1900 2018-05-08 21:10:59 This is not the same old world where islamofascism held Jimmy Carter hostage over oil! We are now a net exporter of oil not a Hostage to foreign oil!
1901 2018-05-08 21:10:56 Funny. Israel is in the war with Syria. It occupied Golan , use its water and oil.

1903 2018-05-08 21:10:39 The history of America interference in Iran goes back decades..America has always sought to get control of Iranian oil. Fuck @realDonaldTrump for escalating tension you are certifiable, a danger to world peace.

1929 2018-05-08 21:09:04 Um yeah I don't get the problem. The deal that was made was for Iran not to produce uranium for Nuclear weapons. The same deal was made with NOKO. Neither of them held up their word. 2nd another part of it was to release Millions of gallons of oil to the U.S....#pt1-2

1941 2018-05-08 21:08:13 Sorry I wasn't clear.  The U.S. dollar is traditionally used for buying and selling oil.  The process is called Petro-Dollar.  If the U.S. dollar isn't used to trade oil, then there will be less demand for U.S. dollars worldwide.  This makes the worth of the U.S. dollar go down.
1942 2018-05-08 21:08:06 The U.S. buys no oil from Iran, so we have no leverage there. The EU, India, Japan, China, Russia ... those are the major buyers of Iranian oil. What leverage do we have over them?
1943 2018-05-08 21:08:05 Was Iran the first "Middle Eastern" country to free itself from the yoke of Western Imperialism? The oil should have bought something for the OPEC countries, but has it bought independence?

1949 2018-05-08 21:07:53 Iran has reason to be concerned -
Trump re-instating sanctions could trigger renewed US sanctions on Iran’s oil sales & Central Bank, potentially disrupting Iran's global financial transactions & puts more pressure on its volatile economy. It's banks that will hurt Iran most.
1950 2018-05-08 21:07:43 Guess they will have to get the oil from somewhere else.
1951 2018-05-08 21:07:40 Our US cousins are more than happy with a UK wide fracking ban. That way the keep the fracking jobs there and export the oil to everybody else.

1959 2018-05-08 21:07:09 So gas and oil prices have jumped wiping out supposed benefits of your tax cut @SpeakerRyan
1960 2018-05-08 21:07:03 Eisenhower helped British Petroleum steal their oil by installing the Shah. 20 some years later they took revenge and also became a theocracy. Just one of our many screw ups in Middle East.

1964 2018-05-08 21:06:57 I read that one of the main reasons for the 1st gulf war was Saddam's decision to change from pricing Iraqi oil in US$ to Euro. Iran announced recently it will begin pricing their oil in Euros and not US$. The US know if global oil isnt priced in US $'s their economy will tank.

1973 2018-05-08 21:06:11 It’s a precursor to military action in Iran by the US. Just give it a few years and the US will have totally surrounded the Arabian gulf and have control of most of the worlds oil. Is it any wonder Iran is pissed off?
1974 2018-05-08 21:06:10 Oil actually dropped today after the President pulled out of the Iran debacle. I hope that we can turn all of our oil spigots on full blast and make Iran and Russia cry for mercy.
1975 2018-05-08 21:06:00 Russia/Putin not only benefit from oil price increase, but Trump also signals undermining support for European Union and allies and promotes destabilization of ME. ALL to Putin’s benefit.  Trump is playing into Putin’s hand.
1976 2018-05-08 21:05:58 Don’t forget it benefits Russia. Buy lessening the likelyhood of Iran joining the global market of oil sales, increases the need for Russian oil on the market and it helps by raising the price of oil which also helps Russia. Falling prices are crippling Putin
1977 2018-05-08 21:05:50 Watch the wholesale crude oil and LNG gas prices over the next week or so (you may also see US frackers rubbing their hands) and then have a guess as to who could have  instigated this Middle-East / Iran witch-hunt...

1980 2018-05-08 21:05:38 Coconut oil
1981 2018-05-08 21:05:35 You're spreading false information and im not shaming you I totally respect you and what you do but I think its rather ignorant of you to ignore the palm oil industry. Its pretty crazy you dont care about the orangutans lol
1982 2018-05-08 21:05:34 Could it be more about oil prices. Rewarding his friends in Arabia and Russia. Plus his other pals in the oild industry.
1983 2018-05-08 21:05:18 Oil prices plunge after of Trump's Iran decision
1984 2018-05-08 21:05:16 Sure hope so. Your tax cuts help no one but your donors and Egyptian oil concerns. #OrascamStrikesAgain
1985 2018-05-08 21:05:12 Why a oil change gotta take up half my day tho 
1986 2018-05-08 21:05:12 A big vote for more ISDS contracts being imposed on us. Branson has sued the NHS, other state held resources will now also be under threat. Not to mention Frackers, Oil Companies etc. Thank you EU and supporters. Your desire for a corporate ubermenschen society is noted.
1987 2018-05-08 21:05:12 Australia losing oil its time for the empire to come back except Canada we don’t want you
1988 2018-05-08 21:05:09 Oil. Over throw Iran. Install a puppet, take the oil. Oil = spoils of war = TOC.
1989 2018-05-08 21:05:03 1. An increase in oil prices, with oil exports being the biggest part of their economy.
2. Reduced American influence in the world.
3. Additional strain on US relationships with our allies.
1990 2018-05-08 21:05:01 John Kerry owns stock in 94+ oil and gas companies at the time of the Iran deal. Part of that deal was the release of Millions of gallons of oil to United States oil companies he has stock in. Of course it's a bad deal for him.
1991 2018-05-08 21:05:01 It's quite simple he/they want to control Gulf oil supplies along with the Saudis.
1992 2018-05-08 21:04:59 So it’s Iran the deep state will try & push now.  Trump another puppet.  USA = an oil company with an army.

1994 2018-05-08 21:04:49 and to make gas prices go up? darn that big oil !!!!
1995 2018-05-08 21:04:49 Following #Trump's decision to re-impose nuclear-related sanctions, the #Iranian economy is likely to contract in 2019, with some importers of the country's oil paring back purchases. Expect economically driven protests to re-emerge.
1996 2018-05-08 21:04:39 Put them both on an oil rig!
1997 2018-05-08 21:04:27 Is oil healthy for the sea life? That’s why there’s oil rigs out in the ocean right?  #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
1998 2018-05-08 21:04:12 Next oil spill in the gulf , why not  dump a tanker full of Dawn?
#StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
1999 2018-05-08 21:04:12 Imagine if Canada had some oil somewhere to sell
2000 2018-05-08 21:04:10 And ALL the business of an oil rich nation that needs everything after nearly 40 years of isolation goes to China, France, Germany. 

Guess that $26bn Boeing deal is done.
2001 2018-05-08 21:04:08 What you on tomorrow? I love seasame oil, it’s the best thing when cooking Thai and Chinese food I think, it’s great with a stir fry, get your noodles covered in it once cooked!
2002 2018-05-08 21:04:06 I think your main agenda/goal is to somehow get me to say Oreos aren’t vegan, and I’m not. I’ve already stated that if you would like to stop consuming palm oil, that’s a fantastic decision. I’m not going to sit here and argue w/ you any further on this subject. Have a good day.

2004 2018-05-08 21:03:59 Going back to 2015 sanctions lowers the price of Iranian oil. Which makes Putin/Russia oil worth more $. This was planned years ago and spoken publicly by stone, manafort. Its not rocket science why Trump did this. #Cult45
2005 2018-05-08 21:03:51 Let's see what happens in Iran.. Israeli missile strikes, backed by USA, followed by an invasion "to stabilize ME", the US oil companies move in. Massive civilian casualties. Invest in RE and EVs.
2006 2018-05-08 21:03:49 It's not about the oil or price of oil.  Its complicated.  Traditionally oil is traded in U.S dollars (called Petro-Dollars).  If oil is traded in Euros, then less U.S. dollars will be used worldwide, which makes the value of the U.S. Dollar go down.
2007 2018-05-08 21:03:38 Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. It was verified by Carter Page during house testimony.
2008 2018-05-08 21:03:35 Not considering the fluidity of expected oil revenue, benchmarks are designed to allow for maximum benefits to the political establishment. When the actual falls below budgeted, the country sinks deeper into debts & finding alternative sources of income is none of their concern.
2009 2018-05-08 21:03:32 MNUCHIN SAYS HE DOESN'T EXPECT OIL PRICES TO GO HIGHER
2010 2018-05-08 21:03:31 Putin/Russia are the beneficiaries when oil price goes up. Also US pulling out of IND will benefit Russia geographically (access to Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf) and China on economic level (Belt and Road initiative). The US is on the losing end of this short-sighted act.
2011 2018-05-08 21:03:29 Hey @ThePainReport how much longer do you think till China and Europe will realise that playing to Trump on Iran is not in their interests and move towards undermining it? #oil
2012 2018-05-08 21:03:27 Since when did shielding corporations who pollute and drilling for oil become legitimate forms protecting the environment? #StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
2013 2018-05-08 21:03:12 Oh wow. You should use jojoba and Jamaican black castor oil
2014 2018-05-08 21:02:51 Putin loves this because oil prices  goes UP and Russia gets more money from oil export #notsmart #PutinsPuppet
2015 2018-05-08 21:02:45 How would that work Dean? He couldn’t get out to put the frozen pizza in the oven - unless the holy oil fire is gonna cook it #SupernaturalUK
2016 2018-05-08 21:02:41 Increasing the price of Russian oil. The Geopolitical weakening of the US. The US has now pulled out of the environmental accords, the Pacific trade agreement meant to challenge China, and now Iran. US's word is longer credible. US led sanctions easier to ignore. Good for Oligs
2017 2018-05-08 21:02:41 BREAKING: a transcript of tRUmp's reasoning has leaked:

"Obama bad. tRUmp hate Obama. 

Bibi good. Says nice things about tRUmp. Also friend of Putin. tRUmp like Bibi. 

Putin wants oil to cost much. When Putin pulls strings, tRUmp dance."

The only thing I can add is: #Sad
2018 2018-05-08 21:02:41 I am rather find of Olbas oil
2019 2018-05-08 21:02:39 Shale oil prod has had limited impact on Iran's oil exports. Case in point, Iran's oil export to EU increased by 800% despite US shale oil reaching everywhere. 

However, execs at Boeing will be shitting themselves. Iran has to buy some 300 aircrafts. Airbus will open Champagne.
2020 2018-05-08 21:02:38 How do you clean the coal? Do you use that dish soap they use to get oil out of the feathers of birds caught in oil spills?

#StupidQuestionsForTheEPA
2021 2018-05-08 21:02:32 1. Since the election, price of oil is up 55%. That's 55% more $$ for Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kochs, etc. (Trillions!)
2. N. Korea is normalized now, so what's Iran go to lose? Nothing. In fact, they can just buy everything FROM N. KOREA! Cash to spare.
3. Trump = Moron.
2022 2018-05-08 21:02:29 And Bibi in this case. Good for Putin as it reduces US standing, increases oil prices, gives RU room to take out place. Good for Bibi, war is always a good distraction from corruption/indictments.
2023 2018-05-08 21:02:23 Yeah will be interesting. It’s oil btw. I’m so fundamentally bearish bc of price pressure up here, but damn this trend.
2024 2018-05-08 21:02:22 I played mid cap stocks today and it reacted similarly.  The #POTUS's wording was very severe which is why I replied with wording that indicated fact.  I play midcap oil/gas so I've been following the news side of things for awhile and it seems to work.
2025 2018-05-08 21:02:16 Still doesn’t come from an animal and the land we use for our vegetable and fruits was once a home for an animal. Also, the meds I use contain gelatin but I still need them and not every forest is cut down for palm oil.
2026 2018-05-08 21:02:15 Talk to the smart workers in the oil and gas sector. They know that oil jobs aren’t coming back, and that Kenney’s agenda of crossing our fingers hoping for another boom will ruin this province #ableg
2027 2018-05-08 21:02:12 Little Kenny’s “trickle down” economics are actually “vacuum up” for the 1%ers. Don’t buy this snake oil! It’s been around for a long time and cures nothing.

2030 2018-05-08 21:02:05 Each $1 rise in gas prices is an extra $530/year in an ave family's annual gas expenses.

#Oil prices r now up 50% under Trump.

Gas prices up 50% = +$1.19: $3.57/gallon. Which is a $700/yr increase/family due to Trump, erasing ALL ave family savings under the #TaxCutsandJobsAct!
2031 2018-05-08 21:02:02 You mean when America buys oil from Saudi Arabia?
2032 2018-05-08 21:01:57 I was wrong, we’re not number 2 in production we’re number 1. Now with Alaskan crude on the rise we will soon be producing more than we consume. Unless you have a problem with increasing the production of oil in the US.
2033 2018-05-08 21:01:51 Russian economy is dependent on oil exports. If Iran can’t sell oil, Russia benefits. Well done, Putin!
2034 2018-05-08 21:01:51 All about Russia, oil, and continued goal of destroying anything Obama did.
2035 2018-05-08 21:01:49 I’ve wrapped up at Trader Joe’s getting my Coconut Oil, now off to Nothing Bundt Cake to fix this craving of mine and to enjoy this discount!
2036 2018-05-08 21:01:45 When he said she put "oil" on the pole I assumed he meant vegetable oil or olive oil or something like that which is completely different than Vaseline or "grease."
2037 2018-05-08 21:01:28 The mid-East burns. And a WWIII breaks out over who goes in and controls all that oil.
2038 2018-05-08 21:01:27 Maybe Trump,  will go find the oil well in the Gulf and unplug that to.
2039 2018-05-08 21:01:25 WTF is a solidarity strategy? That transitioning to Democracy thing has been a historic abject failure. What Trump really wants is control of the Iranian oil fields. The solidarity strategy is between Trump, Iranian oil and lots and lots of money.
2040 2018-05-08 21:01:25 The palm oil industry is cutting down rainforests, homes of billions of ANIMALS for the high demand in palm oil. The same reason we stopped eating meat. Amazing how dense and how you pick to be vegan sometimes but not other times
2041 2018-05-08 21:01:22 Obviously. It was the wrong chess move for trump today, however I’m excited to see the price of oil boom.
2042 2018-05-08 21:01:21 Too bad. Pour palm oil inside

2047 2018-05-08 21:01:10 Off course crud oil was $125 per gallon! Oil is $68 now. Wait till the idiot start the war ad you will see!

2051 2018-05-08 21:00:54 U.S. sanctions against Iran will not hurt much as 60% of Iran's oil Production goes to China & India
2052 2018-05-08 21:00:52 If tomorrow’s EIA inventory report shows unexpected drop in crude oil /gasoline Brent could approach $78/barrel! So much uncertainty, we could see above $80 by the summer!
2053 2018-05-08 21:00:49 Putin likes Assad. Wants Syria’s port for oil transport. Putin also controls Trump. Gonna get interesting.
2054 2018-05-08 21:00:49 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this May? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
2055 2018-05-08 21:00:46 Russia’s oil is worth a lot more without Iran’s on the market. And Russia definitely gains a lot from America being sidelined from the international stage.
2056 2018-05-08 21:00:45 the same man fought the cabals in the banking industry in NIGERIA...i saw a video last year where Sanusi advocated for a youthful NIGERIA who can highlight how he or she would disrupt the cabals in oil industry, economy, power and many more ...
2057 2018-05-08 21:00:45 Looking forward to those $4 gas prices. Vlad's probably happy though. He likes expensive oil

2072 2018-05-08 21:00:09 I agree buying anything with suspect palm oil isn’t best practices, but it can still be vegan. All food production involves disrupting animal habitats to some degree. The palm oil industry is particularly bad in this respect, but it’s not an inherently evil product like meat.
2073 2018-05-08 21:00:07 May 08, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
2074 2018-05-08 21:00:07 To even imply that DJT is making the Iran sanctions decision based on how the price of oil going up could help Russia, that is some twisted thinking. And probably as right as any other reason.
2075 2018-05-08 21:00:03 How Vanilla Ice refuses to talk about an oil rig
2076 2018-05-08 20:59:59 All eyes tomorrow on the EIA’s Weekly Pretorlem Status Report. If API numbers are anywhere near correct, with gasoline and crude stockpiles down, oil and  prices could be on their way up for the week ahead
2077 2018-05-08 20:59:57 Under @realDonaldTrump we now EXPORT oil. But, nice try. If you'd flip the channel from CNN you'd have known that.
2078 2018-05-08 20:59:55 It’s about driving up the price of Crude Oil to benefit Russian interests.
2079 2018-05-08 20:59:52 Instead of worrying about oil spills that might happen and Carbon in the air maybe, the government should advocate to stop the oil, asbestos, lead, and PCBs that wash into the oceans from the ship breaking yards in India and Pakistan.
2080 2018-05-08 20:59:46 The palm oil industry is cutting down rainforests, homes of billions of ANIMALS for the high demand in palm oil YOU DENSE
2081 2018-05-08 20:59:38 LOL. Yemen has no oil.  That's why they're the poorest country in the region.
2082 2018-05-08 20:59:30 He obviously meant 1953, where the Iranian prime minister who had rigged multiple elections, indefinitely suspended parliament and gave himself sole power, was legally removed by the Shah under pressure from the US & UK due to stealing oil refineries without compensation.
2083 2018-05-08 20:59:29 Not questioning trump's racist obsession with Obama, but I think this was more about serving his other masters. By destabilizing the middle east, trump continues to drive the price of oil up. Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Kochs have made trillions because of this.
2084 2018-05-08 20:59:28 You could always look at sectors where gans are being made instead of looking at a sector where they are not, damn near every oil play has ran, banks etc etc and some pot plays had nice moves, not sure how making money is sugar coating things
2085 2018-05-08 20:59:21 Or was it just an FU to Obama, or because Russia told you too? They have immediately stepped into the void you left, as well as China. We know Russia needs oil to be at 100 a barrel for their economy, and China wants to be seen as a legitimate player in the world. Fuckin traitor
2086 2018-05-08 20:59:20 Brent crude oil price has hit $76 last time ERB increased Fuel pump prices Brent crude was at $64 plus the Kwacha pressure in last few days. Won't be long before the next increase.

2099 2018-05-08 20:58:50 So what do you think-
1.Saber rattling, oil prices skyrocket 
2.Something Gulf of Tonkin-esque happens, Strait of Hormuz gets blocked, Oil prices skyrocket even more
3.Throw US military under the Asymmetric warfare bus (again) to appease hawks/Bibi? 
4.Distraction for November?
2100 2018-05-08 20:58:46 $oxy beats by $.21, pays 1% dividend and midstream and chemical margins increase with oil prices.
2101 2018-05-08 20:58:45 Gas prices would rise regardless because it deals on several factors war, production, investment, travel, and Crude oil accidents this all adds up to supply and demand otherwise gas should still be near pennies that are parent's or grandparents paid.

2103 2018-05-08 20:58:37 Let me guess you’re still operating on the ridiculous conspiracy that Obama is secretly a Muslim born in Kenya?
And btw the money returned to Iran as part of the deal was Iran’s own money held frozen by the U.S.
We know Trump is a thief who suggested we steal Iraqi oil & keep $
2104 2018-05-08 20:58:22 Dude I'm not a Democrat. My disgust with TRUMP is watching 30 years of lies, multiple bankruptcies , unchecked and irrational immoral snake oil salesman behavior. But hey keep rolling in bullshit.

2106 2018-05-08 20:58:10 @cnnbrk How can you put out FAKE news stating Trump staying in Iran deal.    Oil plummets.  People, investors lose millions.  Your organization should be fined for dead wrong info or better shut down.   Which county college did your reporters go too.....
2107 2018-05-08 20:58:10 The rest of the world doesn't appreciate F**KFace Von Clown Stick creating a distraction from his never ending legal problems By the way interesting to see how many bots like the post Guess Russia will benefit from the raise in the oil prices & moving in to vacuum in the MiddleE
2108 2018-05-08 20:58:08 One always got messy ass dry weave and the other looks like vinegar and oil on a sub roll lol
2109 2018-05-08 20:58:02 for oil
2110 2018-05-08 20:57:56 As for "bias" and Obama love, this is a fairly clinical story on how much Iranian oil can reasonably be expected to be sidelined. It seems pretty practical that sanctions with international support will tend to be more impactful than those without international support, right?
2111 2018-05-08 20:57:50 “Russia, stands to benefit – the European Union now imports roughly 5 percent of its oil from Iran, and if Iranian oil is off the table, it will increase European dependence on Russian energy.”
2112 2018-05-08 20:57:48 How does staying in a terrible deal that does not prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon make us more secure? Europeans were looking as gas/oil deals more so than Niclear weapons.
2113 2018-05-08 20:57:48 No matter how much water, gel or oil I put in my hair I can never achieve that polished look with my ponytails
2114 2018-05-08 20:57:39 Netanyahu lies. Trump lies. We are in Syria to steal their oil, trump said it before the election. We are there to take the oil and bring in our Big Oil companies... bullshit. They dont care about people.
2115 2018-05-08 20:57:27 But hey, this will tighten the oil market more and drive up prices. That'll make Putin some extra cash.  That was the goal here, right?
2116 2018-05-08 20:57:24 You know who understood the delicate and nuanced complexities of the global oil markets and their effects on international power dynamics? 

I'll give you a clue: her name rhymes with Skillary. Another clue: she put America's interests first.
2117 2018-05-08 20:57:23 To be fair we had a lot of things then that we don't have now. Ringworm, rickets, cod liver oil, scarlet fever, spam, 78 rpm records and an empire.
2118 2018-05-08 20:57:18 Anyone know what eucalyptus oil is good for?
2119 2018-05-08 20:57:16 Trump just wants oil prices to increase to help Russia.
2120 2018-05-08 20:57:13 There is but one insult. A singular insular remark. It's keys are well hidden in the divine.  Take you down on a piece of paper. Diagnosing rugrat or maybe mom. Description fit the horse with bridle and chain saw bit with rat tail file. Red oil or sometimes even green. Chop chop.
2121 2018-05-08 20:57:10 Until they cut off oil to the US and prices jump higher then ever seen. #iran
2122 2018-05-08 20:57:01 Iran ISN'T a threat. The US is a threat. The US has been at war in the ME for decennia and it is always about oil, not religion or the people in the ME. Dictators are overthrown to be replaced by one supporting the US, still dictators though.
2123 2018-05-08 20:57:00 If #Ripple are pushing hard to get RippleNet up and working with @SAMA_GOV, this could only mean that the dollar is going to be replaced for international trade of Oil to begin with. Saudi Arabia is the biggest player in the @OPECSecretariat. $589+ eoy? lol #xrp #xrpthestandard
2124 2018-05-08 20:56:54 Neil maybe you need to sell those oil stocks you have bought into companies with contracts in Iran as you continue want this " deal " to stay so your pockets can get full.
2125 2018-05-08 20:56:45 Let's not pretend that India and China wouldn't have been happy to buy all of that sanctioned Iranian oil.
2126 2018-05-08 20:56:36 Kojo Annan - nine bob note -bent as. Oil 4 food. Remember when this reared its ugly head b4. Nasty piece of goods.
2127 2018-05-08 20:56:34 Rising oil prices are a result of Jerry Brown's gas taxes, not Trump backing out of a bad deal with Iran. News flash America's oil doesn't come from Iran
2128 2018-05-08 20:56:26 I don't know what they think they'll find. Florida is, basically, a highly eroded limestone shelf. There are no oil or gas deposits there that I know of.
2129 2018-05-08 20:56:26 @realDonaldTrump Trump is wanting to create a nuclear stand-off and eventually a war with Iran to justify taking their oil.
2130 2018-05-08 20:56:24 Oh, I know that well. However, oil producers tend to have a disproportionate number of such folks. I worked with Amec from 2009-2012 and recall that the Calgary office, which designs & constructs these operations, was easily 90% deniers around that time.
2131 2018-05-08 20:56:11 $atls 10k out reduces debt by over 21 mil, oil prices rebounding and this company is doing the same.
2132 2018-05-08 20:56:08 U goofy boy get back to work. Your going to the oil bowl game with us Father’s Day weekend to see your cousin @_colton_waters
2133 2018-05-08 20:56:06 And his "promises". Mainly to those who fund him to ensure a steep hike in energy/oil prices, but PROMISES!!!!
2134 2018-05-08 20:56:06 They have been telegraphing this since Day 0. Commit to destabilizing the Middle East. Back Israeli. Provoke Iran. Start war. Take the oil.
2135 2018-05-08 20:56:05 Russia will be laughing all the way to the bank.  This has all to do with oil trade and Trump did exactly what Putin wanted.

2139 2018-05-08 20:55:52 They will be pretty one sided now because European nations that are part of the accord will continue to support the deal and not invoke sanctions leaving the U.S. almost toothless. The oil will still flow.
2140 2018-05-08 20:55:39 Remember when France said Iraq had no WMDs & GOP responded by renaming french fries freedom fries then 4400 US military man and women died fighting over oil?
pepperidge farm remembers
2141 2018-05-08 20:55:38 @TeamCavuto you keep touting the billion dollar deals made by US companies with Iran, a company that yells DEATH TO AMERICA every day.  If those business's ( oil ) like them so much, move over there and set up shop.
2142 2018-05-08 20:55:37 Oil is a motive.
Having a motive doesn't stop war being pointless.
You're not much good at this.
2143 2018-05-08 20:55:36 US definitely has Iran's veins in its hands. Plus ,with the booming shale gas industry and crude oil imports, it has given a perfect substitute of Iran's economy.

2146 2018-05-08 20:55:27 #Oil a caminho de novos máximos anuais?! #EUA avançam com sanções ao #IranDeal
2147 2018-05-08 20:55:25 Trudeau and his cronies have tanked our economy.  Oil is one of Canada's biggest resources but the Liberal government knows squat about anything. Hitting us with carbon taxes which makes our cost of living go up considerably but they won't tell us by how much. Ruining Canada!
2148 2018-05-08 20:55:20 What about the oil they are going to Resume buying from Iran is that on your list I would venture a guess NO nice job hot shot
2149 2018-05-08 20:55:16 good close for oil today tho
2150 2018-05-08 20:55:10 It’s true. They are sacrificing themselves for oil, power, resources and destabilizing other countries. I don’t feel bad for them.
2151 2018-05-08 20:54:59 EU wanted the oil from Iran now they have to buy elsewhere because there are oil sanctions.  tough on them.  a lot of the EU doesn't spend money on military, so they are screwed.  Germany is #1 of those who is screwed.
2152 2018-05-08 20:54:57 Heat some oil, add a clove of gently crushed garlic to it. When the oil is just warm, add 2-3 drops to ear.
2153 2018-05-08 20:54:57 Hot oil is even better 
I dey fear acid pass
2154 2018-05-08 20:54:54 Snake oil salesman
2155 2018-05-08 20:54:46 If you were not a #zionist_idiot I will let you now that #tomorrow #oil_barrel is 80$ hahah, that means #Iran and #Russia economically more stable than you many times and the oil will reach 100$ soon - make #Zionism lead you to #hell #big_ass hahahah
2156 2018-05-08 20:54:43 That sucks for the globalists that exploit Iran's oil money out of their greed...
2157 2018-05-08 20:54:41 You forgot that he’s taking their oil
2158 2018-05-08 20:54:40 Oil closes lower after Trump pulls US out of Iran deal but this won't last in the long term.
2159 2018-05-08 20:54:27 And where does all that oil come from? If you guessed Crimea, you would be 100% correct.

Putin couldn't figure out how to get the oil out of Siberia without it being prohibitively cost effective, so he stole Crimea for the oil and the handy dandy sea port.
2160 2018-05-08 20:54:23 Ok, so you mean OIL was the convincing argument? Because Iran is denying our USD and petrodollar, and is the essentially the only middle eastern country to do so? Conflict with Iran needs to be justified so we can spread some more democracy and all that jazz.
2161 2018-05-08 20:54:13 Yeah! Really liked the sesame oil, tasty  looking forward to tomorrow’s cookathon...
2162 2018-05-08 20:54:00 Both of the above, me thinks there's a 3rd player, Putin. US leaves the accord & Putin comes in & takes over, saves the day. Russia is becoming world leader as Trump & his isolationism minions give up leadership. Putin also wins, de-stabilizing region, means his oil prices go up.
2163 2018-05-08 20:54:00 India & Trump's decision to abandon the Iran Deal:
Iran was India's third largest oil supplier in 2017
India expressed support for JCPOA during Pres. Rouhani visit in Feb.2018
India's commitment to invest $500mill in Iran's Chabahar port
Iran critical to India's regional policy
2164 2018-05-08 20:53:56 No, this helps Putin. Drives Iran closer to him and drives up oil prices.
2165 2018-05-08 20:53:54 That will piss off Putin. He wants high oil prices.
2166 2018-05-08 20:53:49 Well done Trump, keep the Saudi’s happy, as they’ve lots of money and oil. Pity there might not be a planet left to spend any of it but that’s just a small oversight.
2167 2018-05-08 20:53:49 i reaaaaally for a second thought this was about my eating ass tweet and was so confused!

yes! i do the marinade, but i always like to do a batch where it's just smoking hot oil and toasted tandoori and blacken the chicken strips
2168 2018-05-08 20:53:36 The theory is: Trump is the bravest and most powerful. Never mind the country. But you of course know this. There must be something of a personal nature to come out. And if oil prices going up, his bff is happy.
2169 2018-05-08 20:53:35 Crude Oil is at $76 per Barrel. Knew the Iran howler from Trump will come good for Nigeria and other OPEC members. Let's get to the $100+ pb levels, shall we? 
2170 2018-05-08 20:53:31 But it will put money in the pockets of the oil companies, which is the point, right?
2171 2018-05-08 20:53:31 of course he doesn't. also he loves iran actually, well iranian oil. also referred to as "our oil" by some Americans.
2172 2018-05-08 20:53:28 Other countries who signed the deal said Iran kept it's side of the deal.  President Trump never even said Iran didn't keep it's side.  Trump just didn't like the deal.  But this is really about Iran trading oil for Euros instead of Dollars.  It's about the Petro-Dollar.
2173 2018-05-08 20:53:28 I'm getting"so full but I'm not done" is a profound intervention
of the spirit to the soul (s)
2174 2018-05-08 20:53:27 OFAC will be busy...potential inflation? Maybe not...Canada & SA will most likely increase the oil supply...

2176 2018-05-08 20:53:23 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
2177 2018-05-08 20:53:19 It should be mandatory for Trump voters to get to be on the front lines of the lastest right wing war for oil.
2178 2018-05-08 20:53:14 I did   they're made with lye and oil.  It takes that to be safe for the skin and hard enough to last
2179 2018-05-08 20:53:13 Mmmm now bring out the coconut oil and I'll bring a shine to ur gorgeous body and a smile to ur face xox
2180 2018-05-08 20:53:11 If by dims you mean world oil markets then sure. Republicans own all of this mess. This was almost and Iraq war sized mistake.
2181 2018-05-08 20:53:05 Each $1 rise in gas prices is an extra $530/year in an ave family's annual gas expenses.

#Oil prices r now up 50% under Trump.

Gas prices up 50% = +$1.19: $3.57/gallon. Which is a $700/yr increase/family due to Trump, erasing ALL ave family savings under the #TaxCutsandJobsAct!
2182 2018-05-08 20:53:05 Then why cut a deal that allows for Iran to pursue nuclear weapons after first cashing in on its oil? 
2183 2018-05-08 20:53:05 I hope he cuts tax on gas & oil to dampen the spike in gas price induced inflation
2184 2018-05-08 20:52:58 Oil price going up..on a Tuesday 
2185 2018-05-08 20:52:58 If the US pulls out of the Iran deal. I've herd, the middle east plans to sanction the US oil supply.
2186 2018-05-08 20:52:53 Only reason to put sanctions on Iran is to enrich oil companies
2187 2018-05-08 20:52:51 Wahhabism, a extremely radical form of Islam that the Saudi's export around the world. Are you seriously trying to defend one of the most repressive and fundamentalist countries in the Middle East? If you think Iran is bad...they are worse.  The only reason we support them is oil
2188 2018-05-08 20:52:51 Oil prices will climb now.
2189 2018-05-08 20:52:44 We don't get oil from Iran.
2190 2018-05-08 20:52:42 This peppermint castor oil is bomb asf 
2191 2018-05-08 20:52:40 My oil change cost $165 and I'm still heated about it
2192 2018-05-08 20:52:39 my aunt was the worst she used to sit on the backporch for hours absolutely slathered in baby oil to the point where she has scars from burns all over her hands/arms/legs. I have no clue how she managed to evade skin cancer but that shit made me so nervous when I was little
2193 2018-05-08 20:52:30 Trump gon send all these poor souls to die over 1.99 oil prices.
2194 2018-05-08 20:52:27 So as gas and oil prices potentially sky rocket, anyone happy about EPA rolling back fuel efficiency standards?
Yay for increased gas prices!!
2195 2018-05-08 20:52:17 On a net basis we are now an exporter of oil.
2196 2018-05-08 20:52:16 LOL 1. Your retirement account was growing faster under Obama.

2. Your minuscule tax cut becomes a tax HIKE in the next 2 years (actually READ it). 

3. Oil prices are now going to skyrocket (by design) to the benefit of Russian oligarchs, the GOP donor class and NOT YOU.
2197 2018-05-08 20:52:14 This is about oil. It has always been about oil between SA with US and Iran with Russia. China will now join Russia and Iran. Possibly both Korea. Trump wants a war over oil to make the wealthy richer. If you think that's great, you are crazy. This isn't about Gods.
2198 2018-05-08 20:52:13 You using beard oil?
2199 2018-05-08 20:52:12 Was thinking the same thing. Every five years it's, "gas is cheap and will never get expensive again because the world's oil supply is so very secure."

2201 2018-05-08 20:52:00 Russia’s economy is dependent on oil exports. If Iran can’t sell oil, Russia benefits. Well done, Putin!
2202 2018-05-08 20:51:53 How are we depriving them of cash?  They are still in the agreement with all the other nations that signed on.  How is this helpful?  If the rest of the world is buying their oil and we aren’t, the price of gas will go up here.  Good job, you sure you’re not a rocket scientist?

2204 2018-05-08 20:51:53 President #Trump 's  decision to pull out of the #IranNuclearDeal , may probably cause #oil prices to spike.

2205 2018-05-08 20:51:44 NO PUTIN needs higher oil prices, and everything Trump does leads to higher oil prices. Leave the Iran deal, we blockade the oil sales of Iran, so Iran has to sell Oil discounted to Russia, who sells it for a profit.. check oil prices when Obama left to today!!!
2206 2018-05-08 20:51:28 Just got back from court drove 11hrs, I just might need another oil change

2209 2018-05-08 20:51:16 I think Netanyahu exaggerated with the revelations but I must say it is a bold move by Trump; a move that may see oil prices soar as high as $80/barrel. The question here is what happens to our ECA afterwards? With foresight, herein lies a huge gain for us; only if we can see it.
2210 2018-05-08 20:51:16 Nothing guarantees damage to the economy like a spike in oil prices.
2211 2018-05-08 20:51:13 Trump: No more Iran deal.
Gas stations of America and oil companies: Raise prices.
2212 2018-05-08 20:51:13 every time i get my oil changed they tell me the same things over again and i just look at them and say okay and never listen to them
2213 2018-05-08 20:51:12 @DrAseemMalhotra Is cold pressed rapeseed oil OK?
I'm a bit confused as there's contrary information around.
2214 2018-05-08 20:51:08 Oil exports. 
2215 2018-05-08 20:50:58 A lovely Mediterranean salad with a drizzle of olive oil 
2216 2018-05-08 20:50:57 Higher oil prices for his Russian pals.
Distraction from his problems with justice. 
The bastard is ready to start a war to fend off this!
2217 2018-05-08 20:50:55 So Iran will stay in the agreement with the Europeans, but our leaving will result in a possibly extended spike in US oil prices, this is a hell of a MAGA self-own
2218 2018-05-08 20:50:50 Invest in a bottle of sesame oil. :-)
2219 2018-05-08 20:50:48 “We are lying about the oil reserves”!
Check the OPEC website to see by yourself the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. FYI, Yemen is not an OPEC member. They do not have that much oil. We in KSA had enough to build our country and now we have the solar power which is our new oil!
2220 2018-05-08 20:50:44 No, that's the fact that oil prices have gone way up such that Putin is now raking in more money.  Plus now he can sell nuclear equipment to Iran. 

What did we get?   Nothing.
2221 2018-05-08 20:50:39 You should hire her, she is an expert in energy: wind energy and petroleum. She made a great deal buying oil refineries for Brazil. She is also expert in agriculture, specially manioc. Brazilians will be delighted with Dilma living and working abroad!
2222 2018-05-08 20:50:32 Waiting for a Trumper to tell me how leaving the Iran deal isn't better for Russia than it is for the US. Russia pumps and sells oil and gas. Gas and oil well you can see what has been going on with those prices since Trump came to office..What does Russia live off of??OIL&GAS
2223 2018-05-08 20:50:32 Excellent. It'd be as great as the oil tanker in Waterworld!
2224 2018-05-08 20:50:16 The reason losses were cut is due to expectations that Iran's oil production will be cut and will kick-start oil production in the US.  I think that is faulty logic not thinking that other oil-producing countries will do the same.  Could be a lose-lose
2225 2018-05-08 20:50:13 Do you think Trump left the Iran deal on the demand of Putin? So oil prices would go up and Russian oligarchs would recover some of their wealth?
2226 2018-05-08 20:50:03 Meanwhile they have no importing oil and using oil from countries/areas with zero or little human rights and no accountability to the environment.  
Hypocrites!
2227 2018-05-08 20:49:55 Except for the fact that this is driving up the price of oil, which Russia LOVES.....but nobody seems to be reporting on that.
2228 2018-05-08 20:49:50 All of this Iran Deal nonsense is about the USA trying to get Iranian oil

It has nothing to do with the regime
2229 2018-05-08 20:49:50 Not to mention the further contradiction with a domestic marque production mix that seems to have swung substantially towards larger and less fuel efficient vehicles driven largely by low oil prices, higher profitability on them (and very hopes of a Trump EPA reprieve).
2230 2018-05-08 20:49:49 Oil prices at noon were down slightly. June futures. WTI $68, Brent,$74.58 So, it depends on what the other nations negotiate with Iran.
2231 2018-05-08 20:49:42 you mean the miracle of U.S. Money for Oil & American Technology.
2232 2018-05-08 20:49:42 I read your "Tourism and Oil" book and was impressed at your research. Surely, some researchers were aware of this some time ago. If world tourism accounts for 10% of GDP and tourism isn't all local hiking and camping then it was clear something was amiss?
2233 2018-05-08 20:49:37 The oil goons are frothing at the mouth since Trump's announcement.
2234 2018-05-08 20:49:26 PENCIL NECK, LIBERAL HEBREW, WHY ARE YOU ANTI ISRAEL..IRAN WILL MAKE NUKES UNDER ALI BAMA  DEAL..MATTER OF TIME....THIS WAY, WE STOP..TRUMP WILL NUKE THEM, IF THEY TEST, OR  SENT ICBMS..AS HAVE... NOT FOR PEACEFUL  NUKE ENERGY, WHEN THEY HAVE  GAS, OIL AND NO  NEED  NUKE ENERGY.
2235 2018-05-08 20:49:25 Also, capitalism has indeed killed enough people - if you look at all the war waged for oil, directly or indirectly, and the conflict incited to create the demand for weapons! It's just not as perceptible..
2236 2018-05-08 20:49:25 People will profit off cancelling this deal. Follow the money.

Oil money. For starters.
2237 2018-05-08 20:49:16 your channel your community your choice. However we still need to have a smoke off i take dabs of oil all day can you keep up? ;)
2238 2018-05-08 20:49:14 Overregulated? We produce more pollution than our competitors. We have one of the dirtiest oil industries, with some of the weakest enforcement. 
If we were as regulated as you pretend we are the opposition to the oil industry wouldn't be nearly as strong.

why is it so easy to copy other people?
I guess because that's what we watch

me, well said
2241 2018-05-08 20:49:02 We sort of did screw up libya .. for a lot less oil..
2242 2018-05-08 20:48:59 Under deal, China and Russia couldn’t buy or sell oil to Iran or buy from it. Now they can. Iran makes bank.
2243 2018-05-08 20:48:59 So did jojoba oil and it’s distressing
2244 2018-05-08 20:48:57 putting hair in your oil is so therapeutic
2245 2018-05-08 20:48:54 My understanding of the Iran Nuclear Deal is we reduced sanctions on Iran and allow them international trade of oil in exchange for them reducing their nuclear program. But now we're now going to impose sanctions and allow them to develop a nuclear program? Or am I totally off?
2246 2018-05-08 20:48:52 TRUMP IS A GREAT BUSINESSMAN!

Since trump was elected president, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia's have seen the value of their number one export (oil) go up 55%. That's trillions of dollars. This dwarfs all those pesky sanctions. 

He's a great businessman (for foreign powers).
2247 2018-05-08 20:48:51 Obama had united the whole world into sanctioning Iran and as a result Iran's money got devalued by half and coupled with low oil prices, their oil output also was cut in half. Meanwhile the republicans continually undercut Obama's negotiations,
2248 2018-05-08 20:48:46 McConnell is trying to do great things for Kentucky and the nation by passing a farm bill that includes eliminating hemp oil and products (not marijuana, hemp and CBD only) from the controlled substances list to open up markets and create great opportunities.

2251 2018-05-08 20:48:27 This guy has no diplomacy whatsoever if he's such a great deal maker why does he make a deal with Iran. Now saudi arabia is happy now..less oil competition.. they're fingerprints are all over trump getting out.
2252 2018-05-08 20:48:23 Free oil change?! My mechanic really is THAT NIGGA
2253 2018-05-08 20:48:17 Who stands to benefit the most with the increase in oil prices? 

Russia and Saudi Arabia. 

Which are the two countries Trump has, inexplicably for an American President, sided with till now? 

Russia and Saudi Arabia.
2254 2018-05-08 20:48:12 I think its more tied to Russia and Saudi Arabia, Iranian sanctions increase the prices for oil. Its a big win for the poeple that are buying trump.
2255 2018-05-08 20:48:08 Remember kids, any kind of electrodermal biofeedback scan is a scam, and is the electrical equivalent of snake oil :3
2256 2018-05-08 20:48:08 Come on #oil lets get that news to push $USO over $14.50 #API
2257 2018-05-08 20:48:00 Because Trump‘s withdraw of the #IranDeal, oil prices surged to their highest levels since November 2014. Good for: RUSSIA. Oil and gas are responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provide more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
2258 2018-05-08 20:47:57 Crude oil still the most bullish space to be in this year, while the past few weeks EURUSD has become the most bearish. ES is stuck below mid year.
2259 2018-05-08 20:47:55 Louise, do you think this is a backdoor to getting around the Magnitsky Act? Oil prices go up and Trump says he has to do away with Russian sanctions to help the American people.
2260 2018-05-08 20:47:55 Well now that trump walked away from that Iran deal might as well give that money to the oil companies.... Might get you enough fuel to drive out of the servo
2261 2018-05-08 20:47:51 Can’t quite remember - I bought cheap flannels and reused them hundreds of times. So for two kids I probably spent about £10- £15 for flannels and oil. And then washed them with nappies. Much less than disposable wipes I imagine??

2266 2018-05-08 20:47:43 Iran won't starve. Russia, China, & Europe, are still in the deal. Oil is fungible, so they can sell less of it to US Western allies susceptible to US pressure, & more of it to Russia & China, which aren't. Also, Iran knows Mueller's investigation is going full-steam ahead.
2267 2018-05-08 20:47:38 EU is not crazy they are not going to push the price of oil up for themselves bc Putin's puppet says so.
2268 2018-05-08 20:47:36 Let's wait and find out. We are pressuring North Korea so hard that they have no choice. They need oil.
2269 2018-05-08 20:47:35 Iranian government gains strength with Trump’s move. It can sell/buy oil with anyone. Putin got rich today. See skyrocketing oil prices today.
2270 2018-05-08 20:47:27 Message from someone asking, "HOW CAN you make profit shorting crude??!", after being baffled by how I have ONLY shorted crude for the last 3 months.

Well, by capitalizing on volatility, you can make money off anything. 
Stop letting the price play you. it is all relative.
#oil
2271 2018-05-08 20:47:25 John Bolton got it wrong a decades ago. If you need to confront Shia Iran, you would have left Sunni Saddam alone (for a few more years at least). If Iran is attacked now, the Middle East will be on fire, and this includes the much cherished Saudi oil fields.
2272 2018-05-08 20:47:24 He sold US out to China and Russian, UAE oil interests, whose kidding who. This isn't misguided its all about the money.
2273 2018-05-08 20:47:24 America Oil Fields can increase Production, and take-up the "slack" that Iran will leave, in Oil Production.  This is a WIN, WIN-America makes the money, and gets the hundreds of thousands of Oil Field Jobs, & Refinery Jobs. @eaglefordshale #MAGA @POTUS
2274 2018-05-08 20:47:15 #Gas has been going nuts since #Trump got in. Now leaving the Iran deal is going to crank up global oil prices even further. Way to watch out for the little guy @realDonaldTrump
2275 2018-05-08 20:47:12 You bet! Exxon will move ahead with getting that 500 million dollars worth of oil now! Well none of us will be able to afford gas now so Rex can keep his oil!
2276 2018-05-08 20:47:04 i am ill & huffing this ecualyptus oil like a popper
2277 2018-05-08 20:47:01 “How’s your day going?” 
I put essential oil in my vape instead of juice...
2278 2018-05-08 20:46:51 Oh, I think there was an all over nuln oil wash in there too. You can play fast and loose with the layers of washes and the mojave though, just helps create depth.
2279 2018-05-08 20:46:48 Sanctions on Iran --> rise in global oil prices --> increase in oil bill of Pakistan --> increase in trade deficit --> probable drop in value of PKR --> new surge of inflation -->  economic challenges for new govt after elections

2281 2018-05-08 20:46:41 Oil is dropping. Better luck next time
2282 2018-05-08 20:46:41 I'm sure the 500,000 barrels of oil PER DAY that Europe relies on from Iran has nothing to do with it. Fun fact. #conflictofinterests
2283 2018-05-08 20:46:31 I wonder if the mom rubs gun oil on her nipples?
2284 2018-05-08 20:46:31 Watch the price of oil per barrel skyrocket because we'll be buying it from Russia, just what Putin wanted.
2285 2018-05-08 20:46:29 We're out
Out of touch
Out of step with key allies
Out of lower oil prices
Out of 1/4 of the Presidency at Trump property.

Oh and your out of your house.....is that correct?

Can't wait to watch you all fall

2292 2018-05-08 20:45:59 If #Iran cannot market their #oil freely they won't really have much of an incentive to stick with the #JCPOA. The ball on your court #Europe... #tobeseen
2293 2018-05-08 20:45:59 Yes I am now incredibly fast 
But it’s oil/lube. Should never have fiddled with the chain

2295 2018-05-08 20:45:42 Ever tried oil washing? I’ve had several oily ppl say that oiliness sometimes comes from the body thinking it needs to overcompensate so by putting oil on their faces at night for cleansing it made them less oily...
2296 2018-05-08 20:45:41 From your own article "It’s still not clear whether the refinery will have access to more oil from the Trans Mountain pipeline"

Nothing is clear.
2297 2018-05-08 20:45:39 Free oil change  I love being a gator!  #Perks
2298 2018-05-08 20:45:38 Okay folks stop driving so much push down demand for oil, drive the insensitive to rely on oil down.

2303 2018-05-08 20:45:22 With oil going down right now?   Hmmmmmmm.  Market genius here
2304 2018-05-08 20:45:15 Oh good. One of the ultimate snake oil salesman of all times is now a health advisor. And what's this? We're pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal? Awesome. 
2305 2018-05-08 20:45:15 Trumps is a lap dog for saudi arabia lobbyist and big oil.. gouging customers at the pump.
2306 2018-05-08 20:44:53 Iran has been centre stage and crucial for the AngloZionist Empire since the moment oil was found.
Mossadeq was removed by the CIA and replace by the Sjah who became cocky in late seventies. Khomeini a mullah carefully vetted by Mossad in Paris.
Every empire needs enemies.
2307 2018-05-08 20:44:53 You know they want their oil.
2308 2018-05-08 20:44:50 Yes, petroleum does need reinvigorating.

I know this is a first-hand fact, because I live in the oil patch, literally.

You were the one Speaking from willful ignorance, devoid of facts, because the facts do not fit your emotionally based worldview.
2309 2018-05-08 20:44:46 Imperialism is theft. War for oil is theft. Externalized costs are theft. 

Taxes are only a fraction of the problem.
2310 2018-05-08 20:44:46 Listen to get castor oil for the rush!
2311 2018-05-08 20:44:40 Big salam & lot of prayers for the CJP by the millions of HUNGRY & THIRSTY taxpayers for action against the oil MAFIA, the OGRA, who loot & steal the billions & billions of their money regularly  on monthly basis, let their looted money be returned to them in months not in  YEARS

2316 2018-05-08 20:44:13 Why is it our allies would plead with Trump to keep current sanctions on Iran, but he want to have it his way and screw everyone else. Nothing more than a power play which will hurt you and me on , higher oil prices, more world tension. Let's not forget hawks on his cabinet.
2317 2018-05-08 20:44:11 If every vehicle was an EV, not refining oil for fuel would save more electricity than the EVs require. Mixed with smart, grid controlled, V2G charging, EVs become a storage solution & peak demand resource for the grid, rather than a problem. OVO are already offering managed V2G.
2318 2018-05-08 20:44:11 Stop $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas,as promised. 
Empower Entrepreneurship.

2319 2018-05-08 20:44:10 Um Legacies are good things so you are basically admitting this was a good deal and Trump took it away to hurt Obama.  The rest of the world will still honor the deal.  This just allows Russia tosell more oil
2320 2018-05-08 20:44:09 Olive oil!!! 
2321 2018-05-08 20:44:07 Spike in natural gas exports benefits Russia; spike in crude oil benefits Saudis.
2322 2018-05-08 20:44:05 3 faces of losers. EU is spineless, kowtow to rogue Iran regime in exchange for oil and biz. Knowing that #IranDeal was flaw and one-sided, they went on and signed it. Iran continues to make nuclear bomb at secret location. @realDonaldTrump  is saving America and the world
2323 2018-05-08 20:44:04 i would love to know who made the bottle of olive oil so fucking hard to open i'm about to split my hand trying to get the cap off
2324 2018-05-08 20:44:03 ..I just deleted my tweet because I have an explanation, so, extra-virgin olive oil is a higher quality but smokes and burns at a lower temperature, you should be dipping bread in this, making sauces, putting it on your salad, using the cheaper/lower quality stuff for cooking.

2326 2018-05-08 20:43:50 Oil prices go up and Trump says he needs to remove all Russian sanctions so the American people can drive. That this was Obama's deal is icing for Trump on Russia's cake.
2327 2018-05-08 20:43:50 He literally bathed in oil
2328 2018-05-08 20:43:49 And that's a sad sad thing. little trump has done this to first drive oil prices high, making quick money for his leeching friends and second to bring a war to the middle East that will likely turn nuclear. He's certifiable. A draft dodging coward will never understand war.
2329 2018-05-08 20:43:41 Serious question, do you think Russia truly sees this action as a negative? If they remain in JCPOA and continue trading with Iran while US sanctions push oil price up, it doubly benefits Russia doesn’t it?

2332 2018-05-08 20:43:27 we did this in Iraq and look what happened? Wasn't oil supposed to pay for the war, and weren't they suppose to embrace democracy? No kids to worry about but if I were a parent I would be concerned about the shit we are leaving behind.
2333 2018-05-08 20:43:22 It wasn’t that painful for me but it’s just annoying cause I went back to the surgeon and now I have gauze covered in clove oil in the hole

2337 2018-05-08 20:43:05 Congrats. Americans will pay more at the pump while you line your pockets from investing in oil and war. I can see why your wife left you, Sir.
2338 2018-05-08 20:43:02 You are not smart. Very little understanding of how the world works. #MAGA watch price of oil rise, watch your health care costs rise, watch rural America take an economic hit in the teeth (thank you tariffs)-All because Trump obsessed with work accomplished by 1st Black POTUS.
2339 2018-05-08 20:42:55 Good news for Big Oil & Russia! As Trump rips up the Six Nation Accord with Iran, prices of petroleum products will shoot up, and his Russian pals get to pump and dump more oil _and_ renew their waning influence in Iran, who were drifting West.
2340 2018-05-08 20:42:49 and toxic genocidal US shale oil producers...
2341 2018-05-08 20:42:48 I feel very bad for Iran. They are being bullied all because they refused years ago for their nations policy to be dictated by demons and mostly because they didn't want their oil to be stolen by Americans. Very unjust
2342 2018-05-08 20:42:44 We don't need their oil, Trumps plan is to produce all we need here. Money stays here more Americans have good jobs win win  #MAGA
2343 2018-05-08 20:42:44 I don't think so at all. #AgentOrange has driven a wedge between the EU and US, given a green light to Iran nuclear restart and kicked oil price uncertainty into the next gear.... for what?
2344 2018-05-08 20:42:38 Stocks end little changed. Crude oil cuts losses after Iran decision. Comcast sinks six percent. BU-92TU
2345 2018-05-08 20:42:38 @DrSueDVM  Well said! How soon they forget the US Hostages + Oil Embargo of the 70's! Or all the IEDS Iran sent to Iraq..
2346 2018-05-08 20:42:34 Obama had united the whole world into sanctioning Iran, devaluing Iran's money and oil production by half while the republicans continually undercut Obama's negotiations, But now with oil prices up and only America having sanctions, the radicals in Iran must be laughing
2347 2018-05-08 20:42:28 So was the lack of a sell out home crowd? Fall in oil industry linked?
2348 2018-05-08 20:42:27 Oh god, you’re  not going to try to free them are you? 
 “freeing” another Middle East country at a cost of millions of lives and trillions of dollars
Not to mention, you telegraphed your position on “freeing people” you’ll do it if you get their oil. No?
2349 2018-05-08 20:42:27 I had such a successful day off. I cleaned my dirty ass room, washed and put up all my clothes, voted, got an oil change, got my Mothers Day gifts, went to lunch, got my brothers graduation gift, and paid off my bills for the month of June.
2350 2018-05-08 20:42:20 Hi Kim. Please email us for info. on why we use canola oil. socialmedia@tendergreens.com
2351 2018-05-08 20:42:20 and..I would like to see the price of oil today and tomorrow.
2352 2018-05-08 20:42:20 It's like President Bush all over again. Fake information, eventual war, and a crashing economy. GOP owned by the military industrial complex, NRA, and Big Oil.  Iran might be bad and funding terrorists, but now this will escalate back to our home shores again thanks to Trump.
2353 2018-05-08 20:42:14 Because heavy industry will gear up and the price of oil will climb? Mmm..
2354 2018-05-08 20:42:13 Trump's just dying to grab that oil! Gee, I wonder what those meetings with Saudi Arabia were all about.
2355 2018-05-08 20:42:03 The wealth was just redistributed with the Tax scam, The massive funding for weapons and war. Who profits the super rich and corporations, who suffers? The working class, the poor. And certainly the victims of our proxy wars for wealth and control of oil. Succeed and compete BS

2362 2018-05-08 20:41:29 tfw you do things out of order because your curious about what it's like
2363 2018-05-08 20:41:25 I GUARANTEE HE HAS INVESTMENTS IN OIL, WHICH WILL COST MORE AND MORE WHILE TRUMP IS IN THE WH, RUSSIAS NUMBER ONE EXPORT IS OIL, TRUMP HAS MILLKIONS INVESTED IN OIL AND GAS HAS GONE UP 50% SINCE TRUMP TOOK OVER, MAKING HIM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WHILE REPLACING THE TAXES HE CUT!
2364 2018-05-08 20:41:24 Because sanctions against Iran worked in the past, of course. 
Plus, NK has no oil nor gas. 
And there is no deranged Netanyahu constantly demanding US to attack Tehran.
Any way, I hope you are right, but Trump is a fraud regardless.
2365 2018-05-08 20:41:16 The Kochs grab for higher oil prices can be seriously stunted if the remaining signatory countries allow Iran to sell oil.
2366 2018-05-08 20:41:15 Its all about oil... same old story! #iraq #iran
2367 2018-05-08 20:41:12 What world leader benefits the most from higher oil prices?

Vladimir Putin
2368 2018-05-08 20:41:10 Asian aisle of hot sauce, sesame oil, and bubbly.
2369 2018-05-08 20:41:09 Watch as oil and gas prices sky rocket.... Trump u got a motor mouth
2370 2018-05-08 20:41:05 I bet that Trump and his rich buddies bought oil stocks and then announce the Iran deal.
2371 2018-05-08 20:41:04 No, he obviously wants a massive war. Great for defense contractors, then when it's over it's great for western oil companies who will reap the profits. I'm surprised you haven't learned how this works over the last several decades.
2372 2018-05-08 20:41:00 Putin already told Trump to 32nd the deal so we can over pay for Russian oil. $46 per barrel in Nov. 2016. It will be double in months.
2373 2018-05-08 20:40:59 I imagine  Saudi Arabia will be producing more oil to keep prices level... as a favor to the Us for tanking the iran deal.
2374 2018-05-08 20:40:55 GASOLINE PRICES-LYING TRUMP IS GOUGING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WITH HIGH GASOLINE PRICES--TO PAY BACK THE OIL COS FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT
2375 2018-05-08 20:40:47 Anywhere that has oil america just wants to have control of Iran has oil and that all America really want cause of the $$$$ signs
2376 2018-05-08 20:40:31 How would YOUR life change if you stopped using oil for good (directly and indirectly)?
2377 2018-05-08 20:40:27 Easy for European "allies", Russia and China to want to keep the Iran nuke deal. They're drooling for the oil deals and know it will be US resources and our blood that will have to step up to deal with a nuclear armed Iran.
2378 2018-05-08 20:40:24 We don't get our oil from Iran.
2379 2018-05-08 20:40:24 History has taught u fools nothing> G.W. Bush was last Repub who flexed his BALLS & how did that fair us? Iran is 2,500 years to our 240 & unlike spoiled americans they know real pain>let the oil prices go sky high 4 truckers again & Repub party will bite the dusk again~
2380 2018-05-08 20:40:22 Why not just declare war already and start dropping nukes on Iran? That would surely get the gas prices rising for your Big Oil friends.
2381 2018-05-08 20:40:17 What are oil futures at now?
2382 2018-05-08 20:40:10 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
2383 2018-05-08 20:39:58 They are ONLY getting screwed because they refuse to capitulate to #Petrodollars to sell their oil. Nukes are a lame excuse. Iraq didn't need nukes, neither did Venezuela, Libya or Syria. What they all have in common is petrodollar-phobia.
2384 2018-05-08 20:39:56 Oil smoil who cares lol what a mistake
2385 2018-05-08 20:39:47 Fuel prices increases driven by carbon tax and increased HST.. If oil goes up truly and stays up very few will weather storm
2386 2018-05-08 20:39:46 don't tell me some of the leaks are 're/ylo is real' or soem bullshit because then it can burn in an oil fire 
2387 2018-05-08 20:39:45 Use extra virgin oil cause you're fed man
2388 2018-05-08 20:39:43 It is literally far cheaper to buy the oil than it is to steal it.
2389 2018-05-08 20:39:41 pulling out of the Iran Deal by @realDonaldTrump will cost @Boeing about $20b. It will also remove western energy companies from Iranian oil and gas fields.... places where Russia has expressed interest in investing up to $50b and can now do so without any western competition.
2390 2018-05-08 20:39:40 With all that oil, Issa mess.
2391 2018-05-08 20:39:37 Wow,Iranian oil for sale in the world markets in Euro's instead of US dollars.Trump is nuts for sure.Petro Euro's,bye bye Petro dollars,how will USA adjust to being a Pariah State?Putin and China must be having a hard time keeping the smirks off their faces. Mission Accomplished
2392 2018-05-08 20:39:33 No, not necessarily, Iran can sell oil for Euros, Chinese Yuan and Indian rupee, lots it can buy in Europe, from China and from India…and with £s in the UK.  Iraq and Russia might follow?
2393 2018-05-08 20:39:32 And gas prices are up now...so a big thank you from the oil industry to Donald Trump for getting those gasoline prices back to 3 dollar a gallon again. 4 dollar next year!!!
2394 2018-05-08 20:39:30 Went to change the oil on the challenger turns out the only way to change the oil is if you take off the shaker part of the hood if you don’t have a special funnel that fits underneath it  no oil for me.
2395 2018-05-08 20:39:28 Trump is "pulling out" of the JCPOA/Iran agreement. Watch the price of oil go through the roof. Hope you all enjoyed $4/gallon gasoline in 2008. It will return.
2396 2018-05-08 20:39:27 By increasing the price of oil, wouldn’t that help the Iranian oil companies and the American ones? In fact, it would help any country that have a lot of barrels on the ships right now.
2397 2018-05-08 20:39:03 and now Iran has to cut back oil production.  who will cover that demand?  oh right..Russia
2398 2018-05-08 20:38:58 1. "Its about the oil, dummy".  He just wants Iran's natural resources and I am sure "a" Trump will get a piece of the action. 
2. Trump is a contrarian for the sake of his ego. NOTHING anyone else has done has merit. He destroys for the sake of destruction.
2399 2018-05-08 20:38:56 The dimwits do not get it. Iran oil shall continue to be purchased by India and South Korea, which NEVER joined sanctions. And now EU China and Russia shall do the same. All that happens is Airbus wins, Boeing loses. Aka America is the cow at the Kushner family sacrifice.

2405 2018-05-08 20:38:37 Not at all. Demand for Iranian oil will drop, causing its price to follow. China & Russia will buy from Iran instead of other sources. Supply will remain stable.
2406 2018-05-08 20:38:36 I hear Trump has slapped Venezuela with sanctions also... another oil rich country who refuses to go to bed with the US being hit with sanctions that US allies whether they like it or not will be forced to abide by.
2407 2018-05-08 20:38:22 We got baby oil and elbows at the crib...
2408 2018-05-08 20:38:13 Because the North Korea “summit” is a scam designed to re-elect Trump. Russian oil money at work!
2409 2018-05-08 20:38:11 The orange Dotard is trying to drive up the barrel price of oil for his boss poutine...
2410 2018-05-08 20:38:09 Good, maybe they could ramp up oil production then?
2411 2018-05-08 20:38:06 Oil is up, Putin is happy. Sanctions are back, some friends make money.
2412 2018-05-08 20:38:03 Kevin, Did you know we now have an embassy in Iraq larger than Vatican City? We are occupiers.

2414 2018-05-08 20:37:47 First, America screwed Iran by replacing a duly elected government, installing a puppet (1953, Shah of Iran anyone?). Now a cretinous, pompus asshat, DJT, screws them again. It does help Russia though, by inflating oil prices.
2415 2018-05-08 20:37:46 When oil prices go up, Trump will use that as an excuse to drop sanctions on Russia. Everything is about sanctions (IMO).
2416 2018-05-08 20:37:46 Iran routinely beat the Iraqi army in battle.  But they won't go to war. They'll just trade with Europe, China, South America, Russia instead of us. Ban oil to the US, dump a few million more a month into Hezbollah. Only an idiot at strategy thinks this is a good strategy.
2417 2018-05-08 20:37:46 As predicted no comment in @cbcnl Here & Now story on coming changes to Marine Protected Areas from those calling for stronger MPAs. Just more industry rhetoric repetition. Here & Now continues to wave the offshore oil industry pom poms. @AnthonyGermain

2420 2018-05-08 20:37:40 They absolutely are.Which one of his cronies will profit the most and how will that funnel into Trump Inc., for his enrichment at the expense of military heroes, both men and  women's lives? How incredibly sickening! Oil, oil, oil!
2421 2018-05-08 20:37:39 Irving Oil employees 3200 Canadians directly and 12 000 people indirectly --- Oil is part of our lives (unless you are willing to give up your computer and cellphone as well as FOOD) --- Payment was proportional to the amount the Corp could manage given current oil price losses.

2423 2018-05-08 20:37:27 Putin is gonna sell a lot more oil now, that's why Trump pulled out

2425 2018-05-08 20:37:12 And for Russian economy. Oil is going up.
2426 2018-05-08 20:37:12 trump didn't like this deal because as long as Iran kept to the deal made by the Obama administration and our allies he would have no reason to attack them. trump wants a reason to attack them and take their OIL.

2428 2018-05-08 20:37:02 There's nothing wrong with pension plans investing wisely to get the best return for the plan. The gotcha is the hypocrisy of Horgan preaching oil and bitumen is bad, yet investing in those same technologies.
2429 2018-05-08 20:36:58 If someone could convince @realDonaldTrump that @BarackObama hated the poor and sick, loved coal and oil, and wanted to make sure the rich pay $0 in taxes, his infantile ego would make him the best President ever.
2430 2018-05-08 20:36:50 Funny thing is that California still imports middle East oil because they refuse to build a pipeline to Texas.
2431 2018-05-08 20:36:48 Only ones that benefit are the Saudis and bibi... Iran should just flood the oil markets to bring everyone to the table....

2434 2018-05-08 20:36:44 Clearly Russian oil profits over Mideast stability.

2436 2018-05-08 20:36:43 We got all the oil we want ,try again
2437 2018-05-08 20:36:40 Then why are oil and gas prices getting higher?
2438 2018-05-08 20:36:39 THe price of oil per barrel was $46 in November 2016. It's almost doubled, now Trump ending the Iran deal means oil will be over $100 per barrel. Just what Putin wanted, since Russia will now be the beneficiary of us paying too much for oil.
2439 2018-05-08 20:36:31 Thanks to #TrumpIran, oil prices now over $75. Ho does it feel now that it's coming out of your pocket?
2440 2018-05-08 20:36:26 Looks like the Saudis manipulated imports again. They want 80, and knew when to do this.
2441 2018-05-08 20:36:22 China and Russia can buy Iranian oil now. Iran makes bank.

2451 2018-05-08 20:35:39 Now this dumb ass @realDonaldTrump  just fucked it all up. So now oil prices are going to going to increase up to $70+ a barrel.
2452 2018-05-08 20:35:37 All about oil and gas. The US and Israel need to back off.
2453 2018-05-08 20:35:35 Inhibit Mideast oil production through war and increase Russian oil profit?
2454 2018-05-08 20:35:31 Exactly. And now that oil prices will rise steeply due to Trump breaking the agreement with Iran, Scott will state that drilling offshore is essential.

2467 2018-05-08 20:35:06 It's already a win for Putin.
Climbing global oil prices are beneficial to Putin & Russia.
2468 2018-05-08 20:35:03 Can you say oil? How about “Let me do what I can to restore Putin’s greatest wish”
2469 2018-05-08 20:35:02 Well Iran (again get him a fucking map!) can screw with the Strait that oil must go through.

Oh yah...trade with Iran means we were buying cheap Iran oil.  Oil that we will now buy from #Russia...

#Putin always benefits from the decision made by #PutinsPuppet
2473 2018-05-08 20:34:44 Exactly. So oil companies will err on the side of expensive.
2474 2018-05-08 20:34:42 .@realDonaldTrump Now invade and take the oil! You promised!
2475 2018-05-08 20:34:38 Stay within your borders and mind your own business, most of the mess of the middle east has been created by America, blow up countries, train and sell arms to them, topple regimes that dont agree with you, send in companies to rebuild the destruction and take there oil, yep

2482 2018-05-08 20:34:09 There’s no denying, Alberta’s debt is the direct result of PCs fiscal management, from late 1980 and forward. They never gave a thought to the day oil royalty income would drastically shrink, despite the inevitability.
2483 2018-05-08 20:34:00 Actually Putin wants a war to distract from Trump Russia...and to bolster his oil interests
2484 2018-05-08 20:33:56 Trump uses sham rhetoric - for example apples & oranges- Iran’s miltary up 5% but economy “bad”  5% vs bad can’t be compared.  Americans need to develop critical thinking as P. T Trump is selling snake oil
2485 2018-05-08 20:33:53 What Trump doesn't realize is that in his desire to rescind everything you did, he's put Israel at risk for nuclear attack from Iran, and put Saudi Arabia back in charge of oil supply.  Gas prices are about to skyrocket again while Israel is under the gun.
2486 2018-05-08 20:33:53 Trump breaks Iran deal. Expect $100 oil in time for summer driving season, price of gas and airflights up, economic downtick, and oh, Bibi sucking the US into a war with Iran that could easily expand from Syria to the region writ large. Brilliant strategy. Sun Tzu would be proud.
2487 2018-05-08 20:33:47 I guess the fact the Kentucky wouldn’t let him EE wasn’t a sign and not just that Slick Willie was being a snake oil salesmen
2488 2018-05-08 20:33:47 He’s angling for the oil in that region. If he destabilizes he oil prices heans his friends get paid.
2489 2018-05-08 20:33:46 UNO is such a useless organization... we let saudi arabia kill those children, just because this disgusting country has got oil...

2492 2018-05-08 20:33:30 War with Iran you say? 90 days and we would have all the oil we would ever need

2498 2018-05-08 20:32:32 i think the most significant tell here is that oil was down today. i think that now there was the big hoop dee doo today about the iran deal, the admin will slow-walk sanctions and iranian oil will go to china and europe. watch oil.
2499 2018-05-08 20:32:31 Once the Mossad & Isral know Iran has Nuke capabilities, as they did with Iraq, will destroy  Iran.!
Our Navy will block The Straights of Hormuz. No Oil out. No refined products in. Iran citizens over throw the mullahs. Freedom!!
2500 2018-05-08 20:32:27 Higher oil prices put more money in Putin's pocket. I'm sure that's just a coincidence. But that's not your issue. Is it?
2501 2018-05-08 20:32:24 Yeah...I know this issue very well.

A problem arises in the world and if the USA acts, we’re imperialist or “just in it for the oil.” If we don’t act we are isolationist and “ignoring our global responsibilities.”

2504 2018-05-08 20:32:20 I have a genius idea. Mani/pedi while waiting for oil change. Men are happy. Women are happy. Nobody wastes time. Brilliant.
2505 2018-05-08 20:32:15 CBC receives 100 percent of its funds from Govt - there is no difference - Oil sands in Canada are dead - resulting in 200 000 high paying jobs and 100 000 yet to come.  Oil Sands is a vital part of the Canadian economy which has been willfully destroyed by the Liberal Govt.
2506 2018-05-08 20:32:15 Sad that Cruz was too lazy to listen and read reports. Our Sec. Of Defense said Iran was complying. Now Iran can sell its oil and do whatever it wants. Trump has no plan.
2507 2018-05-08 20:32:07 A little oil a day will work wonders!
2508 2018-05-08 20:32:06 Soap and coconut oil is all you need.
2509 2018-05-08 20:32:04 This is an act of treason by the POTUS.  He just jump started the Iranian nuclear weapons program which had been on hold for at least the next 15 years.  This is against the best interests of America, except those who own shares in domestic oil reserves.
2510 2018-05-08 20:31:56 Western scientists saying there’s “no evidence of benefit” when talking about ancient health practices like yoga, acupuncture, and oil pulling makes me so mad. Western medicine has only been around for like 200 years. You’re being illogical, condescending, and #racist 
2511 2018-05-08 20:31:50 Pathetic.  You need China and Russia approval to implement strong UN sanctions.   They are not gong to give it and China will likely continue to buy Iran oil.  The president’s ignorance is appalling.
2512 2018-05-08 20:31:23 The Chinese will eat and consume anything. Palm oil,   Rhino horn, Ivory, abalone, monkeys, tiger bones/bile - you name it they eat and allegedly abuse it.

2517 2018-05-08 20:30:38 Cause it will exacerbate Middle East instability and increase oil prices. And who do you think benefits most for an increase in oil prices?
2518 2018-05-08 20:30:37 Just chase your meds with vodka it might help or if you still babble after that try CBD oil
2519 2018-05-08 20:30:35 So Iranian oil goes to Europe and enters the world market that way.  They have no need to negotiate anything.  Unclear what you've accomplished.

2522 2018-05-08 20:30:27 If we start using cars that won’t be using fuel, a lot of oil companies will close up.
2523 2018-05-08 20:30:17 @potus should release oil from oil reserve to keep prices at the pump in check.  Important for election. Use iran as excuse. @DonaldJTrumpJr 's not running but his impeachment process is.  @EricTrump @BretBaier @seanhannity @laurenfritts
2524 2018-05-08 20:30:16 Higher ST but as Rickards pointed out, during the Iraq War oil fell to $6 a barrel because instead of supply disruptions, everyone in the Middle East pumped MOAR. This likely means lower oil in the weeks / months ahead if this escalates further.
2525 2018-05-08 20:30:12 Really? it seemed like it was bringing peace, I don’t remember having a war with Iran? Now we will soon and you love it cause republicans love war and oil stocks which are gonna go way up now too . Hmmmm seems suspiciously like this is to benefit yourselves while endangering us
2526 2018-05-08 20:30:12 Saudi Arabia was responsible for 9/11, not Iran. 15 of the hijackers were Saudi. Saudi spread Wahhabi madrases (IE Islamic Terror Schools) across the middle east, not Iran. All Trump wants is to lift sanctions for Putin & Russia and Exxon to raise oil prices. What's your plan Sen
2527 2018-05-08 20:30:00 The Saudis absolutely hated this deal . Oil won't be going up because we left it.  This deal did nothing but further divide the middle east along  Sunni Shia lines and increase the chances of widespread conflict.
2528 2018-05-08 20:29:50 This is good for single mothers trying to get to work AND feed/clothe/house their families.  Bad for 45’s oil baron cronies.
2529 2018-05-08 20:29:45 Dude: What kind of oil do you want?
Me: I have absolutely no clue
Dude: We got synthetic and ???
Me: I’ll take whatever’s cheaper
This is how I adult.
2530 2018-05-08 20:29:37 Are you suggesting that the State of Alaska should be fiscally responsible have a diversified revenue stream? Good luck pushing that past the Oil Barons... er... I mean the State Senate.
2531 2018-05-08 20:29:34 I thought about vaping but with natural herbs and oil if possible.
2532 2018-05-08 20:29:29 @POTUS probably wants to raise oil prices for his Russian besties.
2533 2018-05-08 20:29:27 Remember when Liberals said the cost of using the internet would explode if Net Neutrality ended? 

Gas prices don’t explode up in one day, “Tomorrow” without a gigantic move up in oil, 1st. These people can only regurgitate what the #MSM says-can’t think for themselves.
2534 2018-05-08 20:29:15 As Gerald Celente has been saying for awhile Iran is where 2 focus. War drums r beating US, Saudi Arabia n Israel with great tension 2 Iran. Saudi's need that oil barrel price much higher 4 their economy. Is war looming,I hope not but things r pointing 2it.
2535 2018-05-08 20:29:15 Europe doesn't have many oil reserves.
2536 2018-05-08 20:29:07 Grate and add toasted sesame seeds, white wine vinegar and pumpkin oil.
2537 2018-05-08 20:29:06 And America can install someone like the Shah again. That worked out great. You think Trump wouldnt take their oil? He alresdy said he would.
2538 2018-05-08 20:29:03 And he is a board member of Genie Oil Company drilling oil in the Golan Heights.
2539 2018-05-08 20:29:00 So buy cheap oil from Iran and support terrorism, is that what is happening?
2540 2018-05-08 20:28:58 Yeah, Putin gets higher oil prices for their oil exports and the opportunity to sell nuclear equipment to Iran. 

I still can't figure out what we gain though.  Anyone know?

2542 2018-05-08 20:28:48 How about NBC airing views of several “oil experts” to give us a broader view of the “opinions” out there. NBC is worthless as a news provider
2543 2018-05-08 20:28:40 Eastern Europe too today too not give free extra 10 billion euros to usa film productions, to usa mexico middle east Africa English oil gas products too, 
usa broadcasting corporations too, usa observatory locations too hotels too
2544 2018-05-08 20:28:29 The rate that my skin produces oil is actually unbelievable... like chill hun it’s not need 
2545 2018-05-08 20:28:26 Oil prices went down.
2546 2018-05-08 20:28:23 @Lawrence Chump iran debacle, is all about OIL ! Prices will double in Europe!. Rest of world, prices will follow!.
2547 2018-05-08 20:28:21 I’ll bet you thought that was a clever, poignant, funny tweet. Why would oil prices spike ? We are less reliant on foreign oil than ever before.

2550 2018-05-08 20:27:56 Oil prices (& thus gasoline) may go up short term, but I think it will be favorable for economy & markets, over time perhaps VERY much so ;)
2551 2018-05-08 20:27:55 This would be great - it would also be a failed attempt by Putin to raise oil prices.
2552 2018-05-08 20:27:42 I stopped being an artist. I did one piece for octyinboots i redid her pen and ink onto oil and just said no i am done with the amount of competition.

2554 2018-05-08 20:27:33 the latex maybe representing an oil spill was genius... it was so vogue Italia editorial I loved it
2555 2018-05-08 20:27:30 Uk-france oil war vs weak italy, migrants only an excuse
2556 2018-05-08 20:27:24 Yes. If Iran cuts oil exports that lowers the supply worldwide. The demand will stay the same. So that makes oil more scarce and drives up the price.

The real short term threat is expanded political uncertainty in the Middle East. What is the next shoe to drop?
2557 2018-05-08 20:27:21 #SaudiArabia now basically siding with Natenyahu against a Muslim nation just to protect their imperial oil interests. I hope all who base their Islamic theology on the petrodollar are watching. I know they been told that Jews are closer to us than shiites. Lol
2558 2018-05-08 20:27:20 Me 30min ago: "I only need a tiny bit of orange zest. If I'm careful I don't need gloves." Me now: scratching as my contact dermatitis kicks in on my right wrist where unbeknownst to me a bit of citrus oil must have landed.
2559 2018-05-08 20:27:20 You aren’t. Miguel just didn’t change your sticker last time we changed oil.
2560 2018-05-08 20:27:19 It isabout controlling ME oil with Saudi. They want Iran’s I am thinking.
2561 2018-05-08 20:27:19 Coconut oil, or another mild cooking oil.
2562 2018-05-08 20:27:16 From Indian point of view, New Delhi is likely to cut oil import from Iran for time being, work slowly on Chabahar while intensify the understanding to engage with Afghan Taliban for securities to its economic projects in Afg. It won't ne surprising if a minister visits Iran soon

You guys need to approve the use of Cannabidiol (CBD oil/extract) for patients of all ages.

It is literally the magic cure for insomnia and pain.

Please legalize medicinal cannabis products and destigmatize them.

2571 2018-05-08 20:26:48 What...what are you looking for specifically?! As in, what purpose are you looking for out of your oil?
2572 2018-05-08 20:26:46 i wrote my governor a couple weeks ago inquiring why PTSD wasn’t on the approved list of conditions for medical cannabis oil in Georgia

2584 2018-05-08 20:26:00 Hey
let’s freeze all of Iran’s trades and take money away from them in oil profit. 
Blame them for terrorism and start an illegal war in their own country.
End the war then give them back their own money.
Then tell them they’re the bad guys and start war with them again.
2585 2018-05-08 20:25:53 I keep going back to that first speech. Among the babble a drumbeat of war. 
...’if we kept the oil you probably wouldn’t have ISIS because that’s where they made their money in the first place.  So we should have kept the oil...Maybe you’ll have another chance.’
2586 2018-05-08 20:25:43 @GunnChevrolet Have a 2017 GMC Denali. Went in for oil change, brought in my own Mobile One 5W30. Confused the hell out of service written! At the end he tried to charge me $45.00 for a free service on a new vehicle! Then, then, find out at home my tires are over inflated. Wow!
2587 2018-05-08 20:25:41 Tbis is all about driving up the price of oil boys !!!!  Trump and cronies, Netinyahu,Dick Cheney, own oil drilling company in the mid east. Iran will screw Europe by driving up oil prices. Rest of world to follow. Oil, campi aign contributions ! Follow the money !
2588 2018-05-08 20:25:33 With the US now out of the Iran deal, we could sure use Energy East to get oil to the east coast refineries rather than subject eastern Canada to higher oil prices, which will eventually hit them at the pumps. Thanks Coderre and Trudeau!!
2589 2018-05-08 20:25:24 It’s uk govts choice how they prioritise their spending. 
Do we need/want trident, being involved in America’s wars for oil or regime change, bombing/ missiles other countries without evidence, crazy system for getting people off disability/ benefits costs more than they save ect

Folks, it's always about the money with Republicans.
2592 2018-05-08 20:25:21 Higher gas prices as Saudi Arabia want? $80 barrel of oil days all over again!
2593 2018-05-08 20:25:11 I wonder if Trump hates the Iran deal b/c Russia is dependent on oil sales.
2594 2018-05-08 20:25:11 Thanks to fracking, we can make plenty of gasoline.  The only reason for a price rise is feckin GREED.  We don't need oil from Iran.

2602 2018-05-08 20:24:49 The saudis and Iranians hate each other, now trump has done this the price of oil will score and who do you think will be the main beneficiary financially from that Israel is running things in Washington now and trump is his puppet.Guy knows more about the M/E than trump does!

2614 2018-05-08 20:24:06 so we need more revenue from oil and gas
2615 2018-05-08 20:24:04 Even cooking oil? Like olive oil?
2616 2018-05-08 20:24:02 @TenderGreens I love your food but limit it due to your use of canola oil! Plllllzzz switch to all olive oil use!
2617 2018-05-08 20:24:01 So, you deny that NoKorea got billions from the EU, and billions more in fuel oil and credits from US and SoKorea, while they continued to to cheat? 

And you deny that NoKorea now has nuclear weapons?  

Thanks for _your_ report from Fantasyland.
2618 2018-05-08 20:24:00 We are looking like we headed towards another War, accept this time it's for that oil that he promised to take in the event we win... Iran is the war that Bolton and Pompeo along with Netanyahu have been aching for... I think Donald believes he is Thanos...
2619 2018-05-08 20:23:53 I bought this bar of Shea moisture soap it’s like green , and so far I like it I also use vitamin E oil on my face . So it helps with the unevenness but the scaliness.....no

2622 2018-05-08 20:23:48 “This time we’ll take the oil” #MAGMA
2623 2018-05-08 20:23:47 I agree with everything you said Senator Casey... but the immediate concern for those who work is the price at the pump.. it’s already over $3 in parts of PA... and rescinding the Iran deal isn’t gonna make it go down... once again the GOP caters to Big Oil over working people 
2624 2018-05-08 20:23:41 This Wild Growth Oil Has My Lashes Flourishinggg
2625 2018-05-08 20:23:36 This doesn’t account for Russian oil.
2626 2018-05-08 20:23:32 China is in an awkward position now.  They depend on Iran oil but they also want to play an active role in Korea talks. The time has arrived where they will have to establish the 3rd pole or side with Russia
2627 2018-05-08 20:23:30 むくり
2628 2018-05-08 20:23:26 Yes. Imposing sanctions on Iran will drive up the price of oil and then lifting sanctions on Russia will allow them to open their gas station and make a lot of money.

2630 2018-05-08 20:23:24 Oil prices go up during a republican administration-historical fact-Don't worry though, if you listen to FOX for a while they will be able to tell you that Obama did it! & you tRumpers are then off the hook. How much was gas in 2016 and what is it now, didn't go down did it?
2631 2018-05-08 20:23:24 What a display of pandering. Anyone who looks at your voting record while Shell Oil had a rig in Puget Sound, what's going on at Hanford, pipelines and fracking would see what a farce this is.
2632 2018-05-08 20:23:24 I feel like if they were lying there’d be literally any support for this move by anyone except Israel (who benefits in an obvious way short term) and Saudi Arabia (oil prices are going to spike and they’re Iran’s rival)
2633 2018-05-08 20:23:20 Trump literally said US "should have taken their oil."
2634 2018-05-08 20:23:07 Oil prices go up even higher. China continues to buy gas from Iran. EU entities without significant US exposure continue to deal with Iran with EU blessing. NK summit blows up. Trump meets with Rouhani.

2637 2018-05-08 20:22:58 This is, frankly, a crock of shit: the 'govt. of Canada' stole the land, so they have no legal title; now they are advocating for a Texas oil company & denying any rights to Indigenous or others. The 'rule of law' is out-of-order & a complete & utter fraud.

President United Slaves of Israel has just given another Chance to Iran to make its Nukes. This time it should be fast and in time.
So that Middle East may not be stable and peaceful till oil ends there and they buy weapons of their total wealth. 
GBA..
2643 2018-05-08 20:22:47 I doubt it, the US is the largest exporter of oil, they are self-insufficient.
2644 2018-05-08 20:22:35 Trump removed us from Iran agreement.  Solid proof of Collusion with Russia.  The price of oil will surge (probably $20/barrel).  We will all loose - except of Russia who needs this money now.  They win with and without the Iran Nuclear Agreement in place. @maddow @AliVelshi

2649 2018-05-08 20:22:16 Gas prices hit near 5 dollars a gallon during Obamas war on oil. I didnt hear you whining then.
2650 2018-05-08 20:22:15 This was a huge mistake. Iran got its money, free to enrich uranium and more than likely Israel is going to bomb that plant. Welcome another middle East War. Oh yeah Oil prices are sure to rise. So much for our tax break. Russia loves this. They make money on Oil.
2651 2018-05-08 20:22:12 It will have zero impact on oil prices over the long term...the market may move up today, but it will normalize once it is clear that the EU will not follow the US in reinstating sanctions and will not be curbing Iran's access to the international banking system.
2652 2018-05-08 20:22:10 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
2653 2018-05-08 20:21:55 Trump want another war so Saudi Arabia  can benefit from the rise of oil prices
2654 2018-05-08 20:21:51 Classic photo of old school drilling. 1. The guy has lost a finger 2. He hasn’t learnt his lesson and has no gloves with hand covered in oil.
2655 2018-05-08 20:21:46 Crappy promise made; crappy promise kept.  Trump did Russia a huge favor because oil prices will rise and that is Russia's primary source of hard revenue.
2656 2018-05-08 20:21:46 It is that and more.  Putin wants higher oil prices.  Sanctioning Iran gives Russia more oil revenue.  Collusion.
2657 2018-05-08 20:21:41 We overthrew their democratic government for oil and you think a minor hostage situation (where all were released unharmed) is worth starting a war? Grow up.

2663 2018-05-08 20:21:23 I smell like  tea tree oil . No regrets.
2664 2018-05-08 20:21:22 If heard of it but still don't see why its going up since we dont get our oil from Iran. Can you make sense of it?
2665 2018-05-08 20:21:22 What does #Trump's Iran nuclear decision mean for #SA @DIRCO_ZA. We have huge oil deals with them?
2666 2018-05-08 20:21:17 Best part about the warmer weather...I’m no longer rapidly depleting my coconut oil. No longer ashy as hell!!!!
2667 2018-05-08 20:21:15 Bad news for india. Decision would lead to higher crude oil price and higher fiscal deficit
2668 2018-05-08 20:21:11 War mongers are out for blood & oil
2669 2018-05-08 20:21:09 Yes, because he's an idiot. BUT....he has kept his whispered promises to those who fund him to ensure a massive hike in oil prices. Nuclear, schmuclear! Wars make money!....winning! Utter, utter thunderercunt that he is!

2673 2018-05-08 20:20:44 WILL they? They've been trending up steadily for weeks simply based on the speculation of pulling out of the deal, so it's pretty much a certainty we'll soon be paying well over $3/gallon after today's news (similar to how oil and gas prices spiked before and during the Iraq war)
2674 2018-05-08 20:20:42 Was it the US/CIA that illegally overthrew the Iranian government in 1953 or the other way around? All because they wanted to nationalize their oil industry.
2675 2018-05-08 20:20:36 As a country we are aligned with allies that have a vested interest in higher oil prices via conflict
2676 2018-05-08 20:20:35 State oil and gas regulators, who've been pushing for years to speed up permitting on federal land, say they're getting closer to that goal after a group of governors mounted a full-court press @Interior. Watch @EENewsUpdates for the story.
2677 2018-05-08 20:20:33 Trump just pushed oil prices higher by withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal, the real game here is trimming OPEC's market share so US Shale gets a bigger hold on global energy markets. Well played commercially but reckless geopolitically. #trump #iran #Oil

2680 2018-05-08 20:20:27 That's how I feel living in Houston. Every time someone says that oil execs knew for decades about global warming, I'm like "oh shit, those people live HERE!'
2681 2018-05-08 20:20:25 Ehhh come on.

The oil rich Moolas needed the cash more than the homeless and starving in this country.

Bush was just as good at taking care of everyone else but our own.
It's infuriating.
2682 2018-05-08 20:20:23 Real reason for pulling out of the deal: get oil prices back up to benefit Putin/Russia and Trump’s wealthy donors. It’s already working. Who will it hurt? The rest of us. Get ready to pay more for gas, goods, etc. 
2683 2018-05-08 20:20:21 War in the Middle East destabilizes oil markets, allowing Putin, Saudi, and many of our GOP members paid by big oil companies to profit massively. We need to keep a close eye on the ME and Europe during this time because that's where the shit will hit the fan first.

2687 2018-05-08 20:20:18 I started watching wild wild country and that was my exact fear. We need an artists union in the building with the musicians and the oil painter
2688 2018-05-08 20:20:17 Spike in oil prices benefit Russia directly. They need to be around $100/barrel to climb out of the red. In other words, Putin would trade a non-nuclear Iran for high-priced oil.

2697 2018-05-08 20:20:00 US has more oil than Iran. End of story.
2698 2018-05-08 20:19:59 Canada needs Eastern pipeline so we limit amount of oil we import. 
Canada needs Western pipeline so we can export more of our oil ... and free up rail cars for other commodities.
2699 2018-05-08 20:19:55 Remember, Trump just wants the crude Oil in the Middle East, doesn't care how he gets it.
2700 2018-05-08 20:19:55 Why!!! Syria is almost free of these terrorists, the biggest terrorist Israel wants slaughter and blood... And control of Syrian oil pipe line.

2702 2018-05-08 20:19:52 So oil prices will rise now. Just remember, oil is the #1 revenue source for Russia.
2703 2018-05-08 20:19:41 Right look what they did 7 countries in 5 years starting with Afghan  and still killing in Afghan every country these Zionists invaded is run by terrorists except Syria why they are trying desperately to put Assad out ti take the land oil and genocide !

2715 2018-05-08 20:19:00 The cost of oil futures went up $2.02 per barrel today after Trump's announcement on Iran.

This translates into a higher US consumer cost of about 17 cents per gallon of gasoline and about a 4% increase in heating oil costs, with additional increases likely in the near future.

2750 2018-05-08 20:17:03 I'm just going to go out on a limb here...Trump seems to be an active Russian asset. This "undoing" does nothing but give Russia access to the oil market.
2751 2018-05-08 20:16:55 Surely we need fracking, despite North Sea Oil, which won't last for ever.  Don't tell me we've got wind power.  Don't insult my intelligence please.
2752 2018-05-08 20:16:53 Under the sanctions imposed in 2015?. If a foreign country buys oil from Iran with out our permission. We can impose sanctions on them. It explains it in the article
2753 2018-05-08 20:16:39 US Closing prices: #DOW 0.02% #NASDAQ -0.09% #Ftse100 -0.02% #GBPUSD 1.3546 #EURGBP 0.8756 #EURUSD 1.1862 #Gold 0.10% #Oil 0.93%
2754 2018-05-08 20:16:39 Peppermint oil does wonders
2755 2018-05-08 20:16:33 It’s not all about Iran. It’s more about how Iran having a nuke benefits Russia. One of the only things Russia exports is oil. They need Iran. Without international inspectors walking around Iran Russia can speed up their nuke program.
2756 2018-05-08 20:16:33 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2757 2018-05-08 20:16:33 Big arms dealers make megabucks. Oil companies make megabucks People are afraid  Russia restores its Iranian nuclear program and biochemical programs. Or the WH is populated by village idiot
2758 2018-05-08 20:16:28 Once his base starts clamoring about the high cost of oil, he will offer relief by buying Putin’s Russian Oil.
2759 2018-05-08 20:16:26 My attitude would be - keep missiles for defense, rather than use them to attack other countries. None of the countries that we have bombed have ever bombed us or even threatened to. I think there is dirty politics going on for oil,gas & dominance.
2760 2018-05-08 20:16:17 The oil prices o 
2761 2018-05-08 20:16:13 Mahathir is lucky to be in power during the world economy is not as hard and bad as during Najib’s. And oil price is unstable. And people expect Malaysia to survive and live on oil and gas income like during Mahathir’s time. Lol what a joke
2762 2018-05-08 20:16:08 I see. Thank you. So what do you think the US wants with Iran? More oil? What needs to happen for peace?
2763 2018-05-08 20:16:07 @equado11 Your handle should be @atukpa (Yoruba) meaning oil lamp going by your avatar 
2764 2018-05-08 20:16:02 So, my work table fell apart. In the middle of work. Literally, fell apart. There's turpentine and linseed oil on fucking everything. Yeah, it was a cheap, temporary replacement for my old one, but come on. Fuck this week with a magma squirting dildo wrapped in barbed wire
2765 2018-05-08 20:16:02 What the hell... do we need Iran's oil or something?

2768 2018-05-08 20:15:46 AFTERNOON MARKET WATCH: Stocks end little changed after choppy trading. Crude oil falls 1.5%, but cuts losses following President Trump’s decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal.
2769 2018-05-08 20:15:36 If you’re dumb enough to believe that Trump is doing this over nuclear weapons I have a bridge to sell you he’s getting his fat cat friends more money because oil is about to go up
2770 2018-05-08 20:15:28 1. 5th paragraph
2. The intent of the post is to show the failing support for oil. Sorry if I wasn't successful.
2771 2018-05-08 20:15:27 Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran Nuclear Deal is a huge mistake and he doesn't even comprehend that...oil prices will soar, not to mention bringing us closer to war in the Middle East. By doing this the president had destroyed America's word and credibility in the world
2772 2018-05-08 20:15:27 So I didn’t do my coffe and coconut oil routine for like 3 days. And holy shit is that shit cleaning me out today 
2773 2018-05-08 20:15:25 Wish I was smart enough to not work in oil and gas where the temperature ranges from -30 to 110 Fahrenheit. #itsalreadytoohot
2774 2018-05-08 20:15:25 Like oil from water people who don’t belong in your life will eventual drift away from you, as you rise!!!
2775 2018-05-08 20:15:21 Utter silence, with no transcendent authority The Room 302 from the emergence of that everything Oil as key is telling you
2776 2018-05-08 20:15:20 Twitter, which of you was it that wanted Bio Oil? I promised to send my surplus to someone, but I can’t find it in my DM’s (I’m sorry, I have been hopeless at sending it)...
2777 2018-05-08 20:15:15 I called Honda to schedule an oil change & my friend was like “You just got one?” Bitch! I said what I said!
I got Zeppelin in January & this fucker & I have already been to;
Palm Springs & Santa Barbara once & San Diego three times. Vroom vroom.
2778 2018-05-08 20:15:14 The pullout was a directive from Putin to give him a monopoly on Iranian oil and weaken our ties with the Eu and Germany
2779 2018-05-08 20:15:14 Bingo! I read some time ago that Putin needs $100 a barrel oil to keep the Russian army fed and mobile, and the oligarchs tamed.

2781 2018-05-08 20:15:06 My niece did the dishes earlier. I just made myself a cup of tea and realised there's a tiny bit of oil floating in my cup. I just...now I have to make another cup.
2782 2018-05-08 20:15:03 Honey usa dosent love your country ,,he love your oil
2783 2018-05-08 20:15:02 To Europe, we don’t need their oil.
2784 2018-05-08 20:14:58 My claim is based on economic forecasts (in the article) made by people who are more qualified than you or I on the subject. And I never said his post didn't matter, I'm saying today's market doesn't disprove the fact that oil could continue to rise in cost.
2785 2018-05-08 20:14:53 Stocks are ending little changed and oil prices fell after President Donald Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and would reimpose sanctions on the country.

2789 2018-05-08 20:14:44 Very nice of $45* to give his buddy Putin all that extra oil money.  Hey who doesn't want to pay $5 a gallon for gas this summer???  This administration is an absolute joke and anybody who voted trumplethinskin in should be ashamed of themselves.
2790 2018-05-08 20:14:43 Love it in the small image.  Click on it and it pixilates. I'm guessing it's oil on canvas or?
2791 2018-05-08 20:14:43 Hubbo chubbo wubbo oiled up wrestling. The sound of the oil schlick as you two rub against each other for a good grip in glorious combat.
2792 2018-05-08 20:14:38 Ending #IranNuclearDeal is Trump’s gift to Putin.. coming; record breaking oil prices to enrich Russian economy. War that Bolton can’t wait to have and a big FuckU to Americans
2793 2018-05-08 20:14:32 No security interest - No Iraq Oil, gas prices go up, US Oil men make a load more money.  That's all it is.

2796 2018-05-08 20:14:23 Better use public transport bcoz the need for car(Resultant need for oil from Jihadis) would be reduced plus you don't have to do the hard work of cancelling any peacefool driver through Ola/Uber app, claim it on Twitter only to be chided by LW/RW & you can contribute good to Env
2797 2018-05-08 20:14:09 This was all a play to profit Putin massively. Along with his oil allies and our GOP takes a lot of money from those Russian allies, so they sit back and cash in while we all get metaphorically raped.
2798 2018-05-08 20:14:08 LYING TRUMP ALLOWS OIL COS. TO GOUGE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS- TO PAY OIL COS BACK F.  OR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT--GAS PRICES RISING TO PAY OIL COS
2799 2018-05-08 20:14:04 Ouuuchhh! Usually if im off out with my legs out, I moisturise, use a lil bit of bio oil all over then talcum powder between your thighs/where you rub the most!! Works perfect for me x
2800 2018-05-08 20:14:01 Pulling out of the Iran deal, is a serious mistake !  Trump is trying to drive up the price of oil, for his cronies. Netenyahu, Chaney, own an oil drilling COMPANY IN ISREAL. When European prices rise, so will oil everywhere!
2801 2018-05-08 20:14:00 Did RSA restore its import of Iranian oil after #JCPOA came into effect? If sp to what extent?
2802 2018-05-08 20:13:51 Still, this doesn’t distract from the current situation in Myanmar, just a shame they done have oil or gas. 2/2
2803 2018-05-08 20:13:49 Of course they do, it provides them more power/control on gas/oil prices...
2804 2018-05-08 20:13:49 @santiagoqr1 just opted out of buying something because it had palm oil AND was in insane plastic packaging and my heart exploded with happiness
2805 2018-05-08 20:13:42 On my standard “crowd watch” Aberdeen are consistently unable to sell out, even for games that really matter. Has the oil money really dried up??
2806 2018-05-08 20:13:36 I’ve worked in the oil industry for the past 10 years supplying pipe products and trust me this price rising is nothing but bullshit greed period. There is tons of oil ready to be produced but the big oil companies are greedy
2807 2018-05-08 20:13:35 Is that an old Humble Oil A&M sticker from 1960 on the other side.  I've got the whole SWC versions of those framed in my office. Nice touch.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2809 2018-05-08 20:13:27 Oil prices will go up. Will suit the Russians. Funny how it works out.
2810 2018-05-08 20:13:26 No reason for this when we don't get oil from Iran. We pump enough oil here in the U.S.
2811 2018-05-08 20:13:22 Put some avacado oil on em hoe
2812 2018-05-08 20:13:14 We've been rising for 3 quarters now in oil. The equities are finally moving in kind.
2813 2018-05-08 20:13:07 Bad... if for no other reason... its based on fake news, specially made and targetted at Trump, for this reason. Netanyahu played Trump like a fiddle. Pics of old plans and old research, presented as "new" threats, its the same fake WMD line Bush Jr. used...

No nukes, just oil..
2814 2018-05-08 20:13:06 Terrible decision from #DonaldTrump regarding the #IranNuclearDeal to quit the agreement made in 2015. Of course #israel applaud that as they financed #trump campaign along with the @NRA and both want an US confrontation against Iran for their oil and gas.
2815 2018-05-08 20:13:01 Now that we've left the deal, Iran is free to pursue nuclear weapons, and it destabilizes the ME, and gives Putin more authority due to a tarnished US reputation. Destabilizing the ME increases Putin and Saudi Arabia's oil profits and takes heat off of Israel.
2816 2018-05-08 20:12:56 Iran backs out and starts developing nuclear weapons again. Oil prices will go up and God help us, who knows what else?
2817 2018-05-08 20:12:52 Stock indexes bounce around but end flat as Trump sets potential destruction of Iranian regime. Dow +0.01%, Nasdaq +0.02%, S&P -0.03%
Oil off as some traders who bought the rumor (end of Iranian oil imports) sold on the news. Crude -$1.03 to $69.70 but up from day's low of $67.63
2818 2018-05-08 20:12:44 He just bottomed out their economy. This is in service of the Saudis, keeping oil prices high and fracking going. Pure selfishness.  War serves oil, oil serves war
2819 2018-05-08 20:12:43 Drives up the price of oil. Russia is a petrol state. Allows Russia to maneuver its influence in the wake of reduced international credibility.
2820 2018-05-08 20:12:37 Did all that grocery shopping and forgot oil
2821 2018-05-08 20:12:36 Only thing thats determining that is flower vs oil, wax etc
2822 2018-05-08 20:12:35 Today I learned our "rat" problem is actually a "family of rats" problem. What I know:
1. They're outside.
2. Because bird feeders.
3. Spraying oil on the poles = can't climb them.
4. Chopped garlic cloves: so far, they have not ventured out since.
2823 2018-05-08 20:12:34 You know if you really look at it the Iran deal was all about putting more oil on the market to depress the cost of oil and gasoline that means cheap fuel not so much for us but our allies but just its principal they're Bad actors they don't deserve our money
2824 2018-05-08 20:12:33 Please tell me you are taking Bayley a bottle of fish oil.
2825 2018-05-08 20:12:27 Russia will profit for sure, oil is one of their biggest exports.

2827 2018-05-08 20:12:21 Is #Trump indirectly destroying indian ambitions

Chabahar port unuseable

CAATSA ordeal. Castle of Indian armoury will now become castle of junk armoury

India is one of the largest foreign investors in Iran's oil and gas industry. Sanction on Iran
2828 2018-05-08 20:12:10 He can hardly wait to go to war and for oil prices to careen out of control.
2829 2018-05-08 20:12:06 Now that Israel has forced US to renege on Iran deal Zionists will just want war with Syria to get hold of its oil and water.
2830 2018-05-08 20:12:06 What an ignorant Ph.D holder!

Is oil now a commodity you take to market and sell immediately??
2831 2018-05-08 20:12:05 Or, yknow, the fact that they are oil rich again due to the Nuclear deal and the business opportunities it opened them up to. Or that they continue to be the largest state sponsor/donor to terrorism in the world
2832 2018-05-08 20:12:04 I think we will see that the sanction will bring out a hand in hand working agreement between NK-Iran in the Nuke program. They are working together , I understand that sanctions do not always work but it weakens the country that has poor resources they have oil , so it is tough
2833 2018-05-08 20:11:47 And now Putin can continue to sell nuclear technology to Iran, while waiting for oil to climb to the $100 per barrel— the price needed to get him out of the red.
2834 2018-05-08 20:11:46 . Trump pulls out of Iran deal

2. Israel attacking Syria

3. Oil prices will rise, good for Nigeria 

4. Petrol Import prices will rise 

5. So its either NNPC uses part of  the profits from oil sales to import more expensive fuel and pay subsidies or expect fuel lines again.
2835 2018-05-08 20:11:45 Dear readers of our public articles, public oil and natural gas articles this week will be limited due to traveling schedule.

We will return with our usual write-ups next week.

Thank you,

2836 2018-05-08 20:11:44 The people talking about the fallout of the oil following this Iran Deal pullout are forgetting that in the last year and a half, America has ramped up exports of oil
2837 2018-05-08 20:11:44 Mxm tissue oil e bereke go dirang mara ye? Weitsi re rekisetswa nonsense
2838 2018-05-08 20:11:42 The north Korean deal just got more expensive to say the least, certainly our nation does not benifit, so who does? What happens to oil prices?
2839 2018-05-08 20:11:39 I’m bout to stop putting Jamaican castor oil on my edges because now they are longgg af and I can’t even do the baby hairs now smh
2840 2018-05-08 20:11:32 Ok here i think is Putin's master plan: split all our allies away (almost done) scrap the nuclear deal (winner) get Iran and Europe and other OPEC parties to come together and agree to buy and sell oil in Rubles or Yuan ONLY and watch as America dies promptly

2843 2018-05-08 20:11:26 Taylor Swift's silence on Oil Crashes Ahead Of Trump is deafening
2844 2018-05-08 20:11:24 Perfect! South Korea and India never joined sanctions. Iranian oil has never gone offline anyway. And now EU Russia and China shall not. #NeoCONDon is a Kushner puppet.
2845 2018-05-08 20:11:19 Gold, oil, and drugs. What does it spell out with the beginning letters.
2846 2018-05-08 20:11:19 Plus driving the oil price up is also good news for Putin
2847 2018-05-08 20:11:17 Iran is a sovereign nation, we don't have the right to dictate anything to them, though we can influence with sanctions. With the deal, we had oversight, allies, & cheaper oil. Their quality of life improved dramatically in the 3 years & were slowly shaking off radicalism.
2848 2018-05-08 20:11:13 I gotta Black 2006 BMW 325ci with 194k on it for sale for $4500 obo. Car A1 just need an oil change. Come drive it.
2849 2018-05-08 20:11:12 Presumably the deal with Iran, and potentially with N. Korea, involve the US handing over many dollars. Iran is using this to buy military equipment as the Gulf States are increasing their military spending. The US is a key ally of Saudi Arabia and needs to keep oil flowing.
2850 2018-05-08 20:11:08 Oil change turned into very expensive brake replacement. Weh
2851 2018-05-08 20:11:07 Hey, psst! You know the Saudis? Our "allies" that sell us oil? They're just as bad as the Iranians.
2852 2018-05-08 20:11:06 Is he wrong nope oil prices will be increased the middle east will get worse then it already is the Iranians have been following the deal pointless to end it. I didn't agree with all of Obama's policies but this a great deal Iran could go back to being nuclear due to this.
2853 2018-05-08 20:11:04 My guess is he probably has a few people in his ear that have lots of oil interests. They just made a fortune off of this decision...and Putin is happy
2854 2018-05-08 20:10:58 Had to get a oil change for ocean city. And gotta bring lele birthday stuff. You at work ?
2855 2018-05-08 20:10:55 Lady sitting here trying to get a discount on an oil change.. but got a Louis Vuitton purse..  Chile please.
2856 2018-05-08 20:10:54 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
2857 2018-05-08 20:10:52 Let’s paint the picture for you, you do not effect Iran, they will lean more and more on Russia and China, Europe wants oil and they want
2858 2018-05-08 20:10:51 Did you consider that Russia is an oil state, and that their economy is in the shitter? Rising oil prices would be a big help to them. In addition, Russian influence in the area will grow stronger.

So, 2 birds...anti Obama, pro Putin.
2859 2018-05-08 20:10:49 You’re as much of a fool. What is it? Oil?
2860 2018-05-08 20:10:48 It is a Shia Muslim country (only major Shia country) fighting with Sunni muslims countries. If it loses to Sunnis, it removes the pressure point from Islam which is kepping it busy in an internecine feud. Why should we glad about increase in oil prices? Or destruction of Iran?
2861 2018-05-08 20:10:47 Such weirdness in Peters it’d be easy to make a case that rather than being for the regions/underbelly of NZ, he’s all for the active destruction of our economy and social wellness.  Nearly 1 billion for MFAT/money to the Islands, 5.5 million to the Clintons/ruining Oil&Gas #WTF
2862 2018-05-08 20:10:40 Oh ok RT @Msjanalove2: I just oomf to pour some oil on me like this is big oily bubble butts volume 74
2863 2018-05-08 20:10:39 How did a $50 oil change turn into $193  and a 2 hour wait with appointment
2864 2018-05-08 20:10:37 HIGH GAS PRICES-CORRUPTION - HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN YEARS- FAKE TRUMP ALLOW OIL COS TO RAISE GAS PRICES TO PAY OIL COS BACK FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT--COLLUSION OF TRUMP & OIL COS.-AMERICAN WORKERS WILL SUFFER
2865 2018-05-08 20:10:32 It all makes me wonder if this is about oil wealth for him and his rich cronies.
2866 2018-05-08 20:10:23 You struggle to represent the interests of the American people how dare you assume to represent the people of another nation.
This looks like control of oil and the Middle East for reasons of power nothing to do with the Iranian people. How many more people will die?
2867 2018-05-08 20:10:21 Yeah, but what about the big business interests in Germany and France that want to buy Iranian oil? Who is looking out for them?
2868 2018-05-08 20:10:20 Ok here i think is Putin's master plan: split all our allies away (almost done) scrap the nuclear deal (winner) get Iran and Europe and other OPEC parties to come together and agree to buy and sell oil in Rubles or Yuan ONLY and watch as America dies promptly
2869 2018-05-08 20:10:20 The oil price is shooting up, bastard!
2870 2018-05-08 20:10:19 America destroyed Iraq and took their countries money, killed the president and took control of the countries oil supply and left the Iraq citizens homeless and they still over in Iraq destroying the people and their minds, smh.
2871 2018-05-08 20:10:09 On the upside oil prices about to go up
2872 2018-05-08 20:10:08 @DeadlineWH "Why not" the Nobel Peace Prize? For a war-mongering, lying, sexual predator crime boss con artist who wants to "take the oil" and torture the families and has the bigger button??! WHY NOT? Maybe b/c Kim Jong-Un SUPPORTED HIS CANDIDACY & now his PRESIDENCY! omg
2873 2018-05-08 20:10:07 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2874 2018-05-08 20:10:05 Yeah sometimes there were better reasons. But make no mistake, first concern was always the oil and weaponry.
2875 2018-05-08 20:10:05 lco method :leave in conditioner, cream, oil works best for me and Jamaican black castor oil is the best oil ! So great
2876 2018-05-08 20:10:04 No one is a bigger winner from this than Russia they need higher oil prices before they go bankrupt. Trump is still the best investment Luton ever made
2877 2018-05-08 20:10:00 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
2878 2018-05-08 20:09:50 He has as much policy knowledge as a 3 year old.. trade war with China..hits the south... Oil making bank on the stock market as gas goes up everyday..  food more expensive.. evicting poor people from affordable housing.. and ACA premiums will go up 90% in some places
2879 2018-05-08 20:09:48 When we pollute the atmosphere by using dirty energy sources like oil, coal, and gas, we end up with dirty weather.-@ClimateReality
2880 2018-05-08 20:09:45 There is nothing shocking about this Administration anymore Cruz and Big Oil for the win
2881 2018-05-08 20:09:42  naye Richie u need a 100 litre of anointing oil
2882 2018-05-08 20:09:41 Lately, each time the U.S sanctions commodity based countries they find a way around the sanctions: Russia & China local currencies, Iran & Turkey oil for gold. Have they not realized that sanctions force countries to find system alternatives
2883 2018-05-08 20:09:34 Not only do they work, they are well loved in the automotive industry.

You take it out and wash it, and then reseal it with oil lubricant.

In most applications it's even worth a few horsepower.
2884 2018-05-08 20:09:31 I just oomf to pour some oil on me like this is big oily bubble butts volume 74
2885 2018-05-08 20:09:31 Muy buena esa Payo!!..Aunque suene a #Utopía, la historia registrará tu lucha como Senador activo. Ya la historia registra la lucha del Senador Huey Pierce Long (Jr.) contra el poderoso J.D.Rockefeller y la Standard oil, financista del ejército Boliviano, para la guerra del chaco
2886 2018-05-08 20:09:30 Agree. Always seems to be about who controls the oil.
2887 2018-05-08 20:09:27 i would like to know who takes half a liter of olive oil for lunch
2888 2018-05-08 20:09:24 You do know that the US has its own oil reserves, correct?
We just need to open a valve and gas price go down.
2889 2018-05-08 20:09:12 As for allowing RIN exports: "...ethanol producers and farmers would bear the brunt of any retaliatory tariffs; they would be subsidizing highly profitable oil companies, who would benefit from the reduced RINs costs."
2890 2018-05-08 20:09:10 I've got some white spirit I was supposed to use for oil painting? Too broke to have weed for like two weeks aswell so it's not like the taste is gonna effect me
2891 2018-05-08 20:09:08 in service of the Saudis and oil
2892 2018-05-08 20:09:03 No, oil prices go up. He's making money for Putin, his boss.
2893 2018-05-08 20:09:01 You forgot the "deficit of doom"

And oil is worthless. ...


2894 2018-05-08 20:09:00 Thought they'd got all their money plus a ready market for oil in China and NK.
2895 2018-05-08 20:08:54 Did you vote for NRA, FDA, big insurance companies, oil companies, banks, arms dealers, financial dealers. But they get their opinion heard.
2896 2018-05-08 20:08:53 Boko haram runs wild thru North Africa and no one gives a shit, why? They ain't got no oil!
2897 2018-05-08 20:08:49 Energy101!
Where Does Energy Come From?
Energy Sources
Coal Source
Natural Gas Source
Oil Source!
2898 2018-05-08 20:08:49 Whatever you guys do in this life, DO NOT get oil of oregano in your eyes. I’d say my life flashed before me, but I legit have been blind for the past five minutes...
2899 2018-05-08 20:08:46 Winners: coal tycoons, oil tycoons, gun tycoons. 

Charlie Kirk is a paid lobbyist for them.

Other Americans, and the rest of the world? We lost this one, but don't lose heart yet, for justice is coming.
2900 2018-05-08 20:08:44 Expensive day. Eye exam. Bike oil change & tire. And then hubs hitting the doctor for something for his chest congestion. Omph.
2901 2018-05-08 20:08:35 olive oil is meant to be amazing for hair...yeah if you wanna fry eggs on it
2902 2018-05-08 20:08:31 Because of the Iran nuclear deal decision by the president, we are now entering in a period of great uncertainty. One of the immediate consequenses will be the rising price of oil which will bring malaise to the american people. Oil affects so many things, and businesses.
2903 2018-05-08 20:08:30 oil and vinegar, you absolute monster
2904 2018-05-08 20:08:24 People again @BarackObama...warn us elections have consequences!!! We depend on our allies for imports such as oil guess Iran has that oil so we will feel the hurt in lower & middle America...get ready for sky rocketing gas prices!!!
2905 2018-05-08 20:08:22 Agree!! Beautiful car, too!! #thankyou
2906 2018-05-08 20:08:16 PIB: Don’t induce lawmakers, Saraki tells oil firms
2907 2018-05-08 20:08:15 >US reinstates oil sanctions on Iran
>OPEC, following a surge in production which priced US fracking companies out of the market, cuts production
>usa is about to implement tariffs on imported raw material

Do you want hyperinflation? Because that's how you get hyperinflation.
2908 2018-05-08 20:08:10 Couple of drops of coconut oil on the creases of her legs should help clear the visible eczema 
2909 2018-05-08 20:08:04 This problem started when the US decided to arm Bin Laden back in the 1980s to help them not get invaded by the USSR. The only real solution is to get ALL the Middle East leaders together and let them solve it amongst themselves. Also this is all about oil.
2910 2018-05-08 20:08:04 Skin care oil that is affordable
2911 2018-05-08 20:07:59 My bad misread that last comment. I think they can sanction oil transactions (not 100% sure) but I doubt they would be pulling out if they didn’t have a strong sanction in place. It’s the only way to get Iran back to the table / deter them
2912 2018-05-08 20:07:54 Non-political in what sense? That the goal of members is just money? Or that OPEC members won’t use oil money to buy armaments? Or to fund political proxies? Or that they won’t use money from oil on Washington lobbyists? Or non- political in some other way?
2913 2018-05-08 20:07:52 You know it’s hot when the raw coconut oil becomes liquid
2914 2018-05-08 20:07:48 Lately I been on this water, witch hazel, moisturizer and MUVA skin glow  with a lil bio oil here and there
2915 2018-05-08 20:07:40 That is very true. I was speaking more to Palm oil and cheap plastic crap in general as oppose to the strange and unfounded medicinal cures...
2916 2018-05-08 20:07:36 No be only oil and gas. Palm oil join too
2917 2018-05-08 20:07:36 Sure, it diversifies their portfolio a bit, but oil producers don't want to be stuck with either Yuan-denominated debt or Gold for more than 10-20% of their portfolios.  Petroeuro failed for the same reason - and now US treasuries are yielding 3%, about the same as china!
2918 2018-05-08 20:07:33 The equities with the most juice to higher oil prices right now are: $SN, $WLL, $CRC, $WPX and $SM
2919 2018-05-08 20:07:27 Energy independence huge now Iran oil sanctions back on. Trump genius.  #MAGA
2920 2018-05-08 20:07:20 #trump pulls US out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposes sanctions as oil fluctuates near its highs. Indices straddle the 50 day moving average with little net movement.
2921 2018-05-08 20:07:16 Wait, so Trump gives Netanyahu a reacharound for the purposes of helping Russia get more money for oil, & war, obv, but the UK don’t & refuse to violate the agreement - so, presumably, Corbyn will get the blame for endangering Israel, or something? 
#ThatsHowThisWorksIsntIt

2923 2018-05-08 20:07:09 People ask why I care about American politics. Here’s why: Trump pulls out of Iran deal. Oil prices rise. Gas prices rise. Petroleum companies get richer. Everyone else gets poorer. QED!
2924 2018-05-08 20:07:08 Oil change. Hate doing car stuff. Hope this doesn't take forever. Then home to take care of Trinity. Then car wash. Then grocery store.
2925 2018-05-08 20:07:03 And now there will be a stage drama attack on Golan Heights blaming Iran and then retaliatory Air Strikes using Saudi and Iraqi Airfields. Oil prices to jump over $100 and poor countries screwed!Like attack on twin towers fm cave in Afghanistan!
2926 2018-05-08 20:07:02 All with @SenateMajLdr seal of approval.. West Virginia and Kentucky are poor labor states, kept that way to please the coal industry, oil companies, big pharma...
2927 2018-05-08 20:07:02 Whaaat? My skin is really oily. I need stuff to dry my skin out a little tbh. I have to wear oil control makeup, my hair soaks it up so even if I go less than 24 hours without washing it and it looks like I haven't washed it in a month!
2928 2018-05-08 20:07:01 Chief Justice is going to intervine in the intrests of Corporate Culture like Telocome Companies, as he said he'll be going to poke oil companies believe me he'll be no more CJ of Pakistan.

2931 2018-05-08 20:06:55 60% of voters oppose the Interior Department's plan to expand oil and gas drilling off coastal states. 70% of respondents supported state's rights to request a drilling exemption through a waiver. (The Hill)
2932 2018-05-08 20:06:53 news is on while i get an oil change... smh. cue "SCREWED" #dirtycomputer
2933 2018-05-08 20:06:53 I guess your boss wanted oil prices to go up, US movement away from its allies, chaos in the middle east and a #shithow in the US. #TheKremlinDon #PutinPuppet #TheTyrannyOfEvilMen
2934 2018-05-08 20:06:52 Hopefully you were long oil
2935 2018-05-08 20:06:50 Oil rallied on news. Good for equities. Good for $DBC (large position). Consider $TBF also, Ramp. Yields going UP from here..
2936 2018-05-08 20:06:45 I saw all of your profile pics. I'm definitely touching myself with oil tonight.
2937 2018-05-08 20:06:43 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2939 2018-05-08 20:06:34 Trump just made the US economy to collapse oil prices will go up the price of gasoline will rise in the US
2940 2018-05-08 20:06:29 Your true friends?
Those that only text you on your birthday and stay the fuck away from you until the next
2941 2018-05-08 20:06:17 Good bless @jkenney  What has Rachel Notely done to fight with BC. Stop a little wine being sold in Alberta. OUCH!!! That hurt those West Coast turds. Close the valves! No more Oil & Gas for BC! Unions for Unions, NDP for NDP'ers. Alberta never had a chance with the Leftwing Nuts
2942 2018-05-08 20:06:12 It sounds that is a lame excuse for him to kill the Iranian nuclear deal. The Russians and the Chinese benefit from this they'll get cheaper oil and the rest of the world will have to pay. Show Trump is doing what Putin wanted him to do in the first place. More treason !!
2943 2018-05-08 20:06:09 "The morning after saying a teary goodbye to his campaign staff, he was in the classroom at 8 a.m. listening to CSU students debate the merits of the Keystone oil pipeline and of a cap-and-trade approach to reducing carbon emissions." Bringing politics into the classroom.
2944 2018-05-08 20:06:05 It's had so many benefits for your government :)) Iran was a very powerful country back then! When the monarch decided to strengthen the country more than before, using his leverage on oil price, they started that stupid revolution and happened what happened!
2945 2018-05-08 20:06:04 OPEC nations are full of corruption economic disparity and human rights abuses

Unless OPEC commits to supporting #religiousfreedom and #dueprocess the #US might as well embargo them and tariff their oil
I don't want their oil
2946 2018-05-08 20:06:04 I don’t do anything special. I do add a little oil to keep them from foaming up, that’s about it. Make sure you’re using enough water — around 2-2.5:1.
2947 2018-05-08 20:06:02 a lottttt a lottttt of sunscreen & then tanning oil!!!!!
2948 2018-05-08 20:05:56 or even a civilian nuclear program which literally every major oil state has a hedge! They're not doing anything dozens of countries aren't already doing.

2950 2018-05-08 20:05:46 This is all bullish for gold. Seasonally a bit early, but there will be accumulation into what will be an uptick in middle-east war risk or just plain tensions. Crude oil could still travel to those targets.
2951 2018-05-08 20:05:43 What is behind amerikkka's withdrawal from Iranian nuke deal? 
Could it all be about sanctioning the Iranian "Oil surge." Iran has the 2nd largest reserves In the region and 4th overall Amerikkka and its cronies enjoy a certain privilege when Iranian Oil is sidelined
#SerialLiar
2952 2018-05-08 20:05:43 When oil prices go up because of this idiot, I will not be kind to any trump supporter. In fact, I'm ready to explode now!
2953 2018-05-08 20:05:35 “Be thy hands anointed with holy oil. Be thy breast anointed with holy oil. Be thy head anointed with holy oil: as kings, priests and prophets were anointed."
2954 2018-05-08 20:05:33 Increased middle east turmoil will cause the price of oil to rise. A key export of Russia is oil and will now be perceived to be the regional stabilizing force, putting them in a stronger partnership with OPEC states.
Following the dollars, how does Trump benefit?
2955 2018-05-08 20:05:25 Oil prices are rising due to increased demand... i shouldn’t expect a doctor to actually know simple economic theories and rules
2956 2018-05-08 20:05:22 Trump's withdrawal from the pact would accelerate regional insecurity, cause a dip in global oil supplies and plunge the Iranian economy into recession.

Iran will negotiate nuclear deal with other countries
2957 2018-05-08 20:05:16 Why would you back outta a nuke agreement ??? U just opened up oil lines --- I'm missing something
2958 2018-05-08 20:05:12 Unilateral sanctions from US may hurt only US. Most of Iran's oil buyers are in Europe and Asia. Trump will once again be left out in the cold.
2959 2018-05-08 20:05:10 and it directly puts money into Putin's pocket as oil prices inevitably rise... Putin got a bargian in tRump...
2960 2018-05-08 20:05:04 The #IranNuclearDeal was a bad deal; however, corporations (including American Oil and Gas) didn't waste time after the deal to start business days #Iran.  A lot of nervous #Israelis tonight. Look at it from their perspective. #Israel
2961 2018-05-08 20:05:03 These are the people rocking the oil money, whether they perform well or not, they still earn fat salaries. They do little or nothing to improve the sector but their fat salaries are guarantee.
2962 2018-05-08 20:04:53 Ah that’ll be our readers who chose Oil&Water as a Fresh Fave. The public have spoken :-)
2963 2018-05-08 20:04:53 Maybe he is helping his BFF Vlad with $100 oil?
2964 2018-05-08 20:04:53 "Oil problem" is a nice paraphrasing for violent regime change because you don't want to pay market prices. This gives an interesting insight into the mind of a libertarian.

And some americans still wonder "why so many people hate us".
2965 2018-05-08 20:04:51 (1) Russia said it will continue to provide weapons (including S400) to Iran/Syria in to make sure that Russia preserves  a critical middle eastern zone of influence in Iran and Syria. (2) Oil gets high, good for Russia.
2966 2018-05-08 20:04:51 Probably a case of Israel's tail wagging the American poodle - Zionists want war with Syria to get full control of its oil and water. Israel already occupies the Golan heights illegally as it does the West Bank and Jerusalem.
2967 2018-05-08 20:04:50 Lots of energy bears trying to short this oil rally. Remember when the original rally happened during the hurricanes and experts said it was temporary? That was the bottom and we have been rallying ever since. #OOTT
2968 2018-05-08 20:04:46 @realDonaldTrump messes with #IranDeal and #oil and #gasprices prices up 18 percent since March. #thanksasshole.  I am sure Putin and the Saudis are happy.   #puppet

2973 2018-05-08 20:04:27 No this is going to help Russia by driving up oil prices.Thats whats important.

2975 2018-05-08 20:04:21 FYI #Iran has :
 $27.3 trillion in natural resources
10% of the world's oil supply
16% of the world's natural gas supply.
#untr_US_table
2976 2018-05-08 20:04:19 It's neat and "we" are probably going to drill it for oil.
2977 2018-05-08 20:04:19 It’s a shame terrorism exploded during Clinton’s two terms and Bush inherited the attacks. The Saudis should have been held accountable and weren’t.  But now that we have our own oil they aren’t nearly as important except as an emerging counterweight to Iran.
2978 2018-05-08 20:04:10 putin certainly likes the effects of further empowering Iran's hardliners & raising the price of #oil. #IranNuclearDeal
2979 2018-05-08 20:04:01 Agent orange says he has proof Iran violated the agreement. I don't believe his lying ass. Especially since he is the only one saying it. I hope his cult enjoys the higher gas prices that are coming. We must help mother Russia after all. They need oil at $100 a barrel for profit
2980 2018-05-08 20:03:53 They are trying to start a war with Iran, to take the pressure of two loads who are under corruption (Bibi) and treason (Trump) investigations. All to benefit the oil gods, and Putin.
2981 2018-05-08 20:03:50 This has nothing to do with the deal.  Iran was keeping it's part.  And another deal could have covered ballistic missles, without scrapping this deal.  But Iran dared to trade oil for Euros instead of Dollars.
2982 2018-05-08 20:03:50 What is behind amerikkka's withdrawal from Iranian nuke deal? 
Could it all be about sanctioning the Iranian "Oil surge." Iran has the 2nd largest reserves In the region and 4th overall Amerikkka and its cronies enjoy a certain privilege when Iranian Oil is sidelined
#SerialLiar
2983 2018-05-08 20:03:50 The deal was working, Trump was just following what Israel, the Gulf countries and the arms lobbies were trying for many yrs, put fire on oil and blame the oil, conclusion more turmoil more wars & on, peace will never be reach with those war mongers

2987 2018-05-08 20:03:28 Oh, and those rising gas prices? Expect them to skyrocket if Iranian oil is suddenly cut off from world markets. Kiss your tax cut goodbye.
2988 2018-05-08 20:03:27 For Shale to kick back in, crude prices need to rise back to $65 per barrel. Taking out a supplier would reduce supply in market thus increasing prices. The increasing oil prices may help EV cars, but before that happens, prices actually need to increase.
2989 2018-05-08 20:03:22 Tbh Olive Oil is a perfect moisturizer and perfect hair mask
2990 2018-05-08 20:03:20 With the impending knowledge of oil depleting, alternative resources are a solution and something that need to be looked at as soon as possible. We have ideas of what we could do, but we just need to find a way to implement them smoothly into society.

3000 2018-05-08 20:02:52 Oil prices are already rising....Not to mention the North Koreans who are a tyrant as are Trump. He's  a silly little boy ,his vocabulary, nor his behavior is no more extensive than his twelve yr old.

3002 2018-05-08 20:02:39 Yes. That’s the plan. Russia and Trump’s wealthy donors (in oil) are the ones profiting from the pullout. Trump is helping Russia. No question. Now, let’s help Donnie into his orange jumpsuit and shackles...
3003 2018-05-08 20:02:39 Trump withdraws from Iran deal, Israel purportedly attacks Iranian sites in Syria, Oil down 1.5% and stocks unch'd-ish.
3004 2018-05-08 20:02:36 Not only is it about hating Obama, it’s about increasing the cost of oil. Be prepared for the return of $3.50/gallon of gas, if not more. So much winning.
3005 2018-05-08 20:02:35 Now you can corner the oil.....
3006 2018-05-08 20:02:16 America has been duped yet again! It’s all about the OIL & MONEY, folks...and let’s keep destroying Obama’s legacy while we are at it...
THE IDIOT just made the World an even more dangerous place...
3007 2018-05-08 20:02:14 It’s health & safety gone *mad*. Distinct lack of baby oil too. Very disappointed. I give this semi-final 2/5 so far.
3008 2018-05-08 20:02:14 I worked out the 6 outta 8 days and now I feel like the tin man before the oil.
3009 2018-05-08 20:02:13 Back in my day, we called it hash oil, and the puke was orange juice and vodka. Ah, the seventies.
3010 2018-05-08 20:02:12 Is anyone going to check if anyone in Trump's circle bought oil futures ahead of todays announcement? @maddow
3011 2018-05-08 20:02:04 Putin should be thrilled... just like the Middle Eastern oil dictators who also stand to profit from this.

Expect oil futures to rise, due to potential embargoes and fears of conflict.
3012 2018-05-08 20:01:58 What is behind amerikkka's withdrawal from Iranian nuke deal? 
Could it all be about sanctioning the Iranian "Oil surge." Iran has the 2nd largest reserves In the region and 4th overall Amerikkka and its cronies enjoy a certain privilege when Iranian Oil is sidelined

3014 2018-05-08 20:01:56 Good thing we filled the oil tank today. My nephew is in Quatar-@POTUS if a hair on his head is harmed you will be personally responsible. #Shame on #PutinsPuppet for throwing a match at a powder keg.
3015 2018-05-08 20:01:56 Just like I said you have no idea what's going on here...Iran is the 3rd  largest supplier of Oil in the world...you guys are on the wrong side of history....again!
3016 2018-05-08 20:01:52 Can someone recommend me a light weight oil that I can use for dry scalp ?
3017 2018-05-08 20:01:45 For Iranian economy, how serious are European adherence to US decision to reimpose sanctions or is bigger play of Chinese and Indian decisions to buy massive amounts of oil from Iran with oil at$70 per barrel?

3021 2018-05-08 20:01:38 Yeah but I think it was still leaking oil when he tested it but maybe he fixed it. Either way it’s been there for years now
3022 2018-05-08 20:01:30 No, it's Putin's plan to make oil more expensive, Russia needs the moneeeeee
3023 2018-05-08 20:01:29 First and foremost it's about oil. Putin didn't invade Crimea because he wanted a beach house. US sanctions on Iran will likely reduce Iranian oil exports by 1,000,000 barrels a day.
3024 2018-05-08 20:01:29 $USO oil going up? Buy $IBB
3025 2018-05-08 20:01:26 Is he standing atop one of those car inspection ramps? That's lucky, my Focus could do with a quick oil change #AUT #Eurovision
3026 2018-05-08 20:01:25 Try natural peppermint oil they don't like the smell also if you want to catch him peanut butter in a cage or by hand with thick gloves they bit and can carry rabies be careful.
3027 2018-05-08 20:01:25 I'm sure Russia will also enjoy the higher oil prices.

3030 2018-05-08 20:01:22 That is always the risk with allowing an open market of ideas. There will always be the snake oil salesmen, the scoundrels, but it's better, in my opinion, to take that risk rather than to throttle the flow in order to protect naive, credulous people.

3032 2018-05-08 20:01:17 Just what Trump Russian bosses want...besides their mob money is to increase the oil income and solidify their hold on Trump
3033 2018-05-08 20:01:15 Not at all. Boiling oil is only useful in very limited situations. I'm all about flexibility.
3034 2018-05-08 20:01:15 Is he trying to provoke a war with Iran? Is @realDonaldTrump trying to please the military industrial complex and big oil? Or is it to bring on Armageddon to please right wing-nut Zionist evangelicals? Or is he just totally insane?
3035 2018-05-08 20:01:14 Coconut oil is that kind of oil that can literally save your life on a regular day to day. Quite regular and so so essential 
3036 2018-05-08 20:01:13 The country would be bankrupt already if we'd voted for it last time. Or am I the only one who remembers that Scotland's oil was going to pay for everything?

3046 2018-05-08 20:00:44 The deal was written with that in mind. Everyone assumed they’d try to cheat so inspections were frequent. Sanctions depended on the deal too. Break deal, no trade with US, EU and China. Iran is going to get rich selling oil again.

3052 2018-05-08 20:00:33 If we put one tenth of the resources into solar energy that we spend on oil pipelines, all our homes and cars would run on sunshine.
Of course, big oil will spend whatever they have to, buying legislators to make sure that doesn't happen!
3053 2018-05-08 20:00:26 Seeing as it was our fault that Iran is the way it is today? As a matter of fact, I wish America would make amends to Iran. Our enemy is not Iran, but the oil companies that want conflict and strife so that their oil prices can be high so that they can make profit off our backs.
3054 2018-05-08 20:00:26 When sanctions were lifted Iran could again sell their oil on the world markets.  Which cause the price of oil to go down, more oil, more gas created, more supply, lower cost to move the product.  It’s called capitalism, you know, Republicans go to for anything / everything.
3055 2018-05-08 20:00:25 #EU should realize that @POTUS was serious about sanctions upon withdrawal from flawed nuclear deal with #Iran.  He could not have been more clear. Are they waiting for “Death to EU” chants? Follow $ & oil when listening to squeals. @VDHanson @DanielPipes @ianbremmer @PressSec
3056 2018-05-08 20:00:21 Ha! It’s a comprehensive profit sharing plan for your globalist cronies to get their hands on Iranian oil reserves. Stop with your crazy ranting, the jig is up, it’s o-ver.
3057 2018-05-08 20:00:18 And the biggest point?
Russia's Petrodollar market will substantially increase, with the oil price index...
3058 2018-05-08 20:00:14 In the meantime, Saudi Arabia (the biggest terrorist financiers in the world) and Israel are raking in our money and jumping for joy because there is no backup plan and they are free to hit Iran for more oil.

3060 2018-05-08 20:00:03 per Israel spokesman on BBC tv today it's all about war & regime change in Iran.
Seems Saudi, UAE, others want it too. And just like with Bush & Iraq fiasco, for Trump's "donors" it's all about making money from increased oil/gasoline and war/military mfg profits

3. Create volatility for oil prices to rebound

3064 2018-05-08 19:59:48 Ack! paleo ginger snaps.
1 c tiger nut flour
3/4 c arrow root flour
2 tbsp oil
1/4 c maple syrup 
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ginger
1 egg
1/4 tsp turmeric (for color)

mix, bake on parchment at 350 for 12minutes
3065 2018-05-08 19:59:45 Oil.
3066 2018-05-08 19:59:44 And Iran will either severely restrict our access to oil or stop trading with us altogether. Hang on to your gas caps; @realDonaldTrump F#%ked up again. #Moron
3067 2018-05-08 19:59:40 USA has a close relationship Saudi (spelled oil), sworen enemies of Iran. Saudi spend thousands of billions to by US military products. It doesn't matter that all but one that attacked the twin towers were saudis. Cash (and oil) rules. As always.
3068 2018-05-08 19:59:38 Doesn't Donald Trump realise that Iran needs a civil nuclear power programme because of the difficulty Iran has in obtaining sources of energy? Apart from the oil, what have they got?
3069 2018-05-08 19:59:38 I would have thought a medievalist like you would favor boiling oil.
3070 2018-05-08 19:59:34 Your comment is over the top I think but they deserve it. I wonder what we're doing with our North Sea oil revenues?

3074 2018-05-08 19:59:21 Your dangerous. Iran has a good reason to protect itself with Trump around. America just want the oil. Why be a puppet to Israel.
3075 2018-05-08 19:59:20 All you bible thumping trumptards are the worse. Trump & being Christian is about as good as oil and water mixing. Grab that pussy, racism, cheating on his wife, oh yeah that’s totally ok in the Bible right?

3078 2018-05-08 19:59:09 but the sanctions on iran will benefit putin by raising the price of oil
3079 2018-05-08 19:59:04 Vitamin E oil
3080 2018-05-08 19:59:02 If the oil price increase substantially it will make fracking more profitable. Let's see what happens.
3081 2018-05-08 19:59:00 As for the animosity with Iran, let me tell you that Iran owns 19% of the world’s proven Natural Gas resources and 9% of the proven oil reserves. This huge chunk of res. is what the US has no control on / benefit of, hence openly advertising and trying for a regime change.
3082 2018-05-08 19:58:55 Trumpsters who think getting out of the deal is a great idea don’t know what was in that deal. Under the deal, China and Russia had agreed not to buy Iranian oil. Now Iran gets richer and can do whatever it wants.
3083 2018-05-08 19:58:47 the sun and oil are calling my name 
3084 2018-05-08 19:58:46 So someone put oil in the up stairs halls and I’ve seen 3 people fall already. 
3085 2018-05-08 19:58:45 Yes. So, they'll ignore the US sanctions, then, will they?? Still (let them) sell oil via Iran's central bank and all that?
Please remember Iran made it very clear that IF the US would pull out, they would too. Don't think they care for IAEA controls.. Too late! :-(
3086 2018-05-08 19:58:40 Praying this oil change is no less than 30 dollars 
3087 2018-05-08 19:58:37 Those are long run results (i.e.- a persistent change in oil prices, long enough to allow capital investment to adjust) based on a highly detailed simulation model. (i.e.- not statistical estimation).
3088 2018-05-08 19:58:36 so are the oligarchs rejoicing..........the price of oil
3089 2018-05-08 19:58:32 Trouble is there's a President who doesn't know or care what convuluted means.
China might swallow some US tariffs if US doesn't like China trading with Iran in return for cheap oil & gas knowing the US might have to reverse such tariffs as unsustainable.
3090 2018-05-08 19:58:32 actually the military complex & ELITES WERE ALL IN N THE OBAMA DEAL/ BOEING & OIL CO /EUROPENA CORP/ AIRLINES BANKS/ THEY WERE ALL PRAT OF THE COLUSION/
3091 2018-05-08 19:58:25 the child out of his office, the chairs wheels squeaking loudly as they went. 

“...Adding ‘asking Frank to oil this chair’ on my to do list...” He mumbled to himself, glaring in the direction of the annoying sound.
3092 2018-05-08 19:58:24 This is NOT about a new deal. More than likely it's a * FIRE SALE * of U.S./Western interests along with * MIDDLE-EAST OIL* to the Russians in exchange for TRUMP'S failed attempt to lift U.S./RUSSIAN sanctions.
3093 2018-05-08 19:58:20 No, she said it's the term they use because the bituminous sands will eventually produce oil. It's no more accurate than tar sands which describes what the bitumen looks like.
3094 2018-05-08 19:58:15 Do you realize the price of oil and were its going to go?
3095 2018-05-08 19:58:15 Will bring up inflation. Rumour is interest rates won't rise cause of govt interference hence even more inflation. And rising oil makes your import bill go up
3096 2018-05-08 19:58:15 This also helps the Russian oil oligarchs because this will most likely cause oil prices to skyrocket.
3097 2018-05-08 19:58:11 Back in 2015, I was at oil field, ran to cabin watching #IranDeal news on CNN. Got messages from Iranian friends happy that they finally can hv their tuitions wired to them. They were very positive. Strange how 3 yrs can change everything. Ultimately, ppl will suffer most.
3098 2018-05-08 19:58:04 This is about oil...like Iraq.  Hope everyone likes paying more than $4 a gallon at the pump.  If they mine the straits of Hormuz,  I guarantee it won’t be DT’s kids fighting the war.  Just stupid.
3099 2018-05-08 19:58:02 $USO Remember Trump unlike Obama is stock market friendly so stop whining about oil prices going up
3100 2018-05-08 19:58:01 Only thing is I don't trust Putin as far as I can throw him. His is a disinformation war! He must be pulling Trump's strings even on this one ... call it gut feeling. I mean Putin was still supplying NK with oil and stuff when we were all supposed to have sanctioned NK!
3101 2018-05-08 19:57:52 It doesnt matter if they were compluong with the terms.  The terms were terrible. Now we can start the process of conquering them and claiming their oil as an american resource.
3102 2018-05-08 19:57:51 That is unpopular? Seems very reasonable to me. Anyone realistic knows Iranians will only defend not take outwardly agressive action. Oil spike helps him, US and KSA too. But how far will "ziowahhabi" axis take / make this thing?
3103 2018-05-08 19:57:49 They like this because Iran vies with them for regional power  . . . And the price of oil is likely to go up.  Win/win.

3107 2018-05-08 19:57:42 Also, it's hilarious that you selectively post the current price of oil today, when it's the highest it's been in four years.

3110 2018-05-08 19:57:36 1. Russia if it was not for it's nukes would be any other eastern european country that no one would pay attention to(yes I know they have oil, but its really the nukes, the oil makes them a saudi arabia) 2. China will split into parts just like the Soviet Union did, give it time
3111 2018-05-08 19:57:34 Did Trump back out of the Iran nuclear deal to drive up oil prices, so that Russia would make more money? #GeneralStrike #ImpeachTrump
3112 2018-05-08 19:57:34 Well done UK, France & Germany...let's hope this is the start of UK Govt distancing itself from #USA's #Neocon strategy which is almost certainly designed to reshape #ME in favour of #Israel & #SaudiArabia and enable West to further plunder the Oil & Gas assets of the region.

3115 2018-05-08 19:57:19 You do realize that Iran has been turned loose to sell its oil again, remove all inspectors and basically do whatever it wants, right? Iran pays zero penalty for this. Iran Win.

Ace: Fish oil sir   — feeling crazy
3117 2018-05-08 19:57:13 Probably not good but it depends on the picture, some could be ok.
3118 2018-05-08 19:57:12 They were allowed to sell oil.
3119 2018-05-08 19:57:05 Oil prices will grow as i read due to that, and this will open a little window, even though it will be dangerous as u mentioned
3120 2018-05-08 19:56:55 Historical blunder. dictating entire world with such drastic decision which will cause trouble to Many Nations specifically to India since we buy oil from them and number of ongoing  industrial projects will be affected due  to such whimsical decision. Entire world will  hate you
3121 2018-05-08 19:56:53 Putin needs high oil prices to survive, & the Koch brothers need $4 gas to make their tar sands boondoggle pay off.
3122 2018-05-08 19:56:52 I think it's more about getting, and keeping, oil prices much higher. $100+ per barrel oil would make Exxon very happy. A happy Exxon donates lots of money to @GOP candidates. Just how the world works.
3123 2018-05-08 19:56:52 countries under the thumb of ai , shit you all have no ide how thay are gonna rain in all this greed . whats a computer need oil for it has renewable energy , it doesnt want diamonds . but will want to conserve the planet ,with or with out our species x
3124 2018-05-08 19:56:46 We are indirectly fucked by oil prices
3125 2018-05-08 19:56:41 So true its sickening. He also wants war, an excuse to take over Iran/Iraq oil fields & an arms race. For a start.
3126 2018-05-08 19:56:41 Bit of a wild night in #oil! all the way back down to $68 down about -3%! now sitting $69.70. So far down -1.5%
3127 2018-05-08 19:56:37 So this is the issue: the US Treasury says “v. Sanctions on the provision of underwriting services, insurance, or reinsurance;”
Does this mean that if a European co provides insurance to a tanker of Iranian oil that US companies can’t do biz with this insurance company?
3128 2018-05-08 19:56:36 Its ALL about oil. Russia, Saudi, and Israel are all working together to dominate the oil market and stop progress on researching forms of fuel that could replace oil.
3129 2018-05-08 19:56:35 Sparkling mineral water with 1 Tbsp delicious good quality vinegar. For example I get a cara-cara orange/vanilla vinegar from an oil and vinegar shop put it in a glass of fizzy water. So good! And healthy! Good call on taking care of yourself tho
3130 2018-05-08 19:56:34 Nuclear blackmail? Right petrodollars need to be kicked out. Wmd blackmailed by Iraq but nothing found. Right oil and resources needed to be grabbed to satisfy big belly..

3131 2018-05-08 19:56:24 Lob some bergamot oil int the Japaese bread for the Earl Grey effect.. #topoftheshop
3132 2018-05-08 19:56:23 Don't worry in next few years the @GOP will have another "Iraq War" but this time with Iran because they allowed Iran to have Weapons of Mass Destruction. But umm I m not sure their will be oil.
3133 2018-05-08 19:56:19 Moody’s Sees #Oil Prices Stay at $45-$65/Barrel in Medium Term - BBG
3134 2018-05-08 19:56:08 Really good to visit @HillfarmOils. Glorious sunshine, great cold pressed rapeseed oil
3135 2018-05-08 19:56:05 Iran's oil is sold mostly to Asian countries little effect on the price Americans pay
3136 2018-05-08 19:56:03 I think it's funny how much people rag on America for always going for oil but the one time we don't people don't like that
3137 2018-05-08 19:55:59 Fair enough.
3138 2018-05-08 19:55:57 Well let me tell you as an Iranian. We are able to block the oil so easily and ruin your alies and military bases in asia and africa in minutes. 
Also no one trust American again. You have north korea yet.
3139 2018-05-08 19:55:54 Iranian sanctions make Russian oil more in demand. Hope #Mueller is watching Trump’s offshore accounts for Russian oil payouts. #TrumpRussia #IranDeal
3140 2018-05-08 19:55:51 No joke oil Charley
3141 2018-05-08 19:55:45 USA to South America he gives religion, music, movies, fast food .. to Africa Ebola, yellow fever, Aids and "humanitarian" planes take precious stones. Pro Middle East they sponsor terrorists erab the oil. and for China and Russia he wants to be friends because they are heavy
3142 2018-05-08 19:55:45 Ist mir schleierhaft, wie man dann noch so was tweeten kann. Brauchen Sie vielleich selbst einen präventiven Tritt in die Eier oder reicht ein kleiner Hinweis zum Völkerrecht, UN-Charta und Iran Oil, aka BP?
3143 2018-05-08 19:55:36 Mark, what should we make of FAQ 2.2? Hypothetical: If I want to sign a new contract tomorrow to buy oil from Iran until November 3, is that allowed or not? The answer seems like a total dodge.
3144 2018-05-08 19:55:35 That is right. Scream. That is what liberals do when they don’t have any facts to support their position. The squeakiest wheel get the oil.
3145 2018-05-08 19:55:31 So Iran kept it's part of the deal.  And instead of getting another deal to cover development of missiles, the entire thing is scrapped, allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons? Bull. This is about the Petro-Dollar.  Iran dared to trade oil in Euros instead of Dollars.
3146 2018-05-08 19:55:28 Expect, Iran will increase oil production or output. 
OPEC will remain the same.
3147 2018-05-08 19:55:26 #sbswinnershour I'll try that Nikki ,slapped some olive oil on my slaphead
3148 2018-05-08 19:55:18 I’m drowning in coconut oil. I am aliveeee
3149 2018-05-08 19:55:13 hi

I just had seen a preacher selling hemp oil to pay for his air time on tv

All oil is a concentrate of the original item

Concentrates are seen as toxins to the body...they inflame the body

All Cancer and most diseases are caused by inflammation of the cells

DO NOT EAT OIL
3150 2018-05-08 19:55:11 Just when you think they can't go any lower they still suprise you by unpacking shovels. Let the digging start! Find me that nice sweet Oil baby! Drill Baby Drill.
3151 2018-05-08 19:55:06 This time last year I was crying in benidorm from sun burn for putting carrot oil on my first holiday how time flys when your life’s falling apart 
3152 2018-05-08 19:55:04 Well while Trump continues his obsession with Presidents Obama. Every American suffers for it. Wonder no one talks about oil prices Keeps going up, those in Trump country don’t seem to care how hi prices go.
3153 2018-05-08 19:55:02 Please bring facts we will read them. So far even the USA intelligence agencies say Iran has done mouthing wrong! President Trump had oil stocks and gas had and will continue to increase until whatever tax break you got will be spent at the Gas station along with even more$$
3154 2018-05-08 19:54:58 When Newfoundland hit oil and made a deal . They could run everything on oil revenues.
3155 2018-05-08 19:54:54 @NLTherapies Thanks for the RT! We are a Cornish company (like you!) who sell essential oil infused necklace! We'd love you to follow us.
3156 2018-05-08 19:54:50 My fatass dog ate the coconut oil & sugar exfoliator I made last night
3157 2018-05-08 19:54:47 No coincidence that 180 days takes us to the #midterms - US does not want a spike in $oil before then
3158 2018-05-08 19:54:42 Russia/Putin benefits from oil price increase and Trump signals undermining support for European Union and allies, promotes destabilization in Middle East. ALL to Putin’s benefit.  Trump is playing into Putin’s hand.
3159 2018-05-08 19:54:36 We give you oil in exchange we send Muftis to build Qoran schools (madreses), business as susual. Sudan in talks with Saudi Arabia for five-year oil aid agreement -minister
3160 2018-05-08 19:54:36 Irans oil goes mostly to Asian countries
3161 2018-05-08 19:54:33 This is a part of Syria that Israel occupy illegally! wonder if this is to do with Genie Energy having sole drilling rights for Gas and Oil. What a surprise
3162 2018-05-08 19:54:23 Oil will rise. Gold will rise. Markets will fall. And Trump will remain a clown.
3163 2018-05-08 19:54:20 $110 barrel oil...welcome back#1
3164 2018-05-08 19:54:19 This is not rocket science. Putin wants the world price of oil up. Especially in Europe.
3165 2018-05-08 19:54:19 sometimes, you just have to put something somewhere, a d know that you're not Done with it yet, but you're done with it Now
3166 2018-05-08 19:54:18 ...with cold water. Pat dry, part hair n' apply oil to scalp, slather in ur leave in conditioner( to hair), moisturize n' seal with any...
3167 2018-05-08 19:54:07 And if I asked one more question, I'd say Trump just violated the JCPOA.  This will diminish US status in the world, increase the likelihood of war and, of course, drive up oil prices.  What will you do in Congr. to make Trump live up to US agreements?
3168 2018-05-08 19:54:07 Is Trump trying to obliterate Obama's work or drive up oil prices? It's a toss up.
3169 2018-05-08 19:54:05 No Iran deal. It's another money grab for 45. Watch oil prices. More land opened up for drilling. Killing the environment. You dont think Rex's time at the WH didn't put 45 in bed with oil companies your naive. Prices are there highest since 2014 "FACT". Follow the money.
3170 2018-05-08 19:53:57 and soon usa will find out they are loosing all allies and stand alone in the world . they loose all grip and will pay high prices for oil , products and inflation will destroy the country. the deficit will be the final killer and trump ? i will blame obama like always
3171 2018-05-08 19:53:52 gotta to change my oil today before i go home
3172 2018-05-08 19:53:49 I will never "go" since I was invited in.  I have every right to my opinion too....along with millions of others who have a similar opinions.  No one in our area wants a dispensary and unnecessary drug use.  The suggested "dispensary" for snake oil was sent elsewhere.
3173 2018-05-08 19:53:49 So far we've cubed it and roasted in olive oil to eat with meat and fish. Good in soup as well though yes.
3174 2018-05-08 19:53:45 For lack of my knowledge, do we spot buy oil or the govt buys oil for certain period in future to avoid exposure to high prices? Thx
3175 2018-05-08 19:53:42 I love love love the smell of tanning oil
3176 2018-05-08 19:53:40 Fainted at work today and honestly was more stressed about the fact that I was laying on the kitchen floor that was covered in oil and lettuce 
3177 2018-05-08 19:53:34 WAR  #Bullish  NOIRANDEAL #bullish #shortthewholedamnthing @QTRResearch $TSLA bonds crashibng #bullish OIL CRUSHED #bullish $SPY #bullish  Rising Rates #BULLISH
3178 2018-05-08 19:53:33 to be specific, the corp tax rate there is 27%, but for oil extraction there's another 51% on top of it, for a hefty 78% total. Surely there's nuance, but that's the basic deal.
3179 2018-05-08 19:53:33 Because they are scare of oil shortages and ISIS....both of which we can deal with.
3180 2018-05-08 19:53:29 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever 

Psalms 23:5-6
3181 2018-05-08 19:53:28 Definitely! Maybe there’s a higher oil content?
3182 2018-05-08 19:53:28 Russia “will be making more bank” off of surging oil prices, thanks to #CadetBoneSpurs and the his belligerent fan club. This guy just told a lie 10x worse than “Iraq WMD” with a straight face to the American people. And you love it.
3183 2018-05-08 19:53:25 And as a bonus the price of oil goes up.
3184 2018-05-08 19:53:21 Wtf I don’t put coconut oil on my lips for two days and my lips get chapped :(
3185 2018-05-08 19:53:17 And don't forget the Chinese. They went along w/scaling back their oil purchases from Iran during Obama admin. Will they do so again now?
3186 2018-05-08 19:53:13 Fun fact: EU buys 500,000 barrels of oil PER DAY from Iran. When we gauge the EU reaction to JCPOA this should always be brought up. Shocking that it almost never is.
3187 2018-05-08 19:53:12 Did Marathon Oil conspire with DNC to take over helium rich lands from unsuspecting poor people in Zimbabwe, before I purchased it?
3188 2018-05-08 19:53:03 Wrong - trump is going to lower cafe standards and gas will be less plus US is oil independent now
3189 2018-05-08 19:52:58 Hmmmm I think I will pass on your generous offer of dick ripping in Lou of a generous application of baby oil to my purple headed crown and enjoy a vid of yours
3190 2018-05-08 19:52:50 Putin gets rich from the rise in oil prices going up. He wants to take over that whole region, and so does Trump, for the OIL. $$
3191 2018-05-08 19:52:41 watch the price of oil and you’ll have the answer to your first question, which is “yes.” the answer to the second is, “many many people are and they’ve tried to warn everyone.
3192 2018-05-08 19:52:41 Thanking God right now that I am no longer active duty and won't have to fight in another bullshit war for oil. Kiss my a$$
3193 2018-05-08 19:52:30 No company will make significant capex investments in the Oil Patch as long there is a risk the #LPC can form gov't - we need to reassess #Confederation as it is currently constituted - let #Ont do #Ont, #BC do #BC and the #West do the #West...best region wins...
3194 2018-05-08 19:52:27 What is the European country most reliant on Iranian oil, the one that should be working the hardest to reduce reliance and secure waivers for its companies? You guessed it, the one with no viable government on the horizon
#italy
3195 2018-05-08 19:52:20 More loss of US prestige worldwide.  Loss of treasure and sky high oil prices if war with Iran occurs.  Opens a door further for Russia and China in the ME.
3196 2018-05-08 19:52:18 Might not have occurred if we hadn't supported/installed the murderous Shah. We have to learn there consequences for screwing up the lives of people in other countries, especially for the sake of oil.
3197 2018-05-08 19:52:16 Great shots of Sam!!
3198 2018-05-08 19:52:08 Russia wants oil prices to increase .... in their best interest to have an unstable Iran
3199 2018-05-08 19:52:08 Well that was a surprise when I saw his speech. Shock horror. When he started it with "Irani Regime" I though it was going to go swimmingly.

Notice the word regime being used when it suits.

"Got oil we want? You're a regime". 

"Saudi? Oh no you're an ally".
3200 2018-05-08 19:52:08 He also forgets conveniently who actually developed the oil sands...
3201 2018-05-08 19:52:06 @ramogifm Charlie iwacho adier,aneno ka joma Tiyo tich lwedo odongore molyo joma olal e boma ni rito ni ibiro luong  e tij office,locked from national oil Oyugis
3202 2018-05-08 19:52:05 I didn't say otherwise. Corporate taxes also vary by industry, eg my oil example.
3203 2018-05-08 19:51:58 Paying my car registration & need an alignment & new brakes & an oil change & I just got all 4 new tires!!!! Being an adult is so fun!!!!!!
3204 2018-05-08 19:51:46 Laughing all the way to the bank. How much are oil prices going to go up?
3205 2018-05-08 19:51:44 So what is the betting that the USA pulling out of the Iran deal forces fuel prices up. Who’s economy is based around oil and benefits from a price hike? 



3206 2018-05-08 19:51:37 OTOH, the insurance issue is a big one. Do you really want to bring a tanker of Iranian oil into a port in China without insurance after the massive tanker fire earlier this year? Sanctions on insurance of Iranian oil return in Nov
3207 2018-05-08 19:51:32 The phrase "extra-virgin olive oil" makes me laugh every time.
3208 2018-05-08 19:51:31 Europe hasn't changed their oil buying based on Trump. Trump has done nothing with Armenia. Trump praises ruthless dictators. Wont impose the sanctions on Russia. Try coming up with some actual true praise for this guy.
3209 2018-05-08 19:51:30 Price of oil goes up, the West splinters, Putin does well
3210 2018-05-08 19:51:23 And Russia will move in more forces and heavy equipment. WW111 has began.Gulf of Hormuz will close.Saudi oil and Iraq output shutdown. US economy crashes!
3211 2018-05-08 19:51:16 You're right I was too light on the chili oil
3212 2018-05-08 19:51:15 Just for context...

The countries most desperate for oil prices to go up:

Venezuela
Russia
3213 2018-05-08 19:51:15 It's no about oil, its about arms.
3214 2018-05-08 19:51:03 Tangent: from an angel or demon perspective, humans have supernatural powers. They can withstand salt and cross salt lines, pentagrams and burning holy oil circles. They’re not affected by angel warding and can’t be summoned like angels and demons.
3215 2018-05-08 19:51:02 #Summer2018

Just put tanning oil on my back and let me roast you consistently...
3216 2018-05-08 19:50:46 note to self: take oil of oregano, black tea, and raw organic honey for a few days
3217 2018-05-08 19:50:42 Saudi Arabia is one match away from being burned to the ground. There are many factions in the country who want to get rid of the royal family. If oil ever drops too low for too long of a time, the regime will fall.
3218 2018-05-08 19:50:38 Trump just wanted to get rid of the Iran deal BECAUSE President Obama sign it into law NOTHING MORE, I am so Disgusted with this ignorant Racist Drooling idiot, he can do nothing for America except PLUNDER it for funds for his greedy self & family, he also want war FOR OIL
3219 2018-05-08 19:50:38 Sulfur stinks to say the least, it also clogs up copper pipes which you have to use for its flow. Fox Business needs to stop lying to Americans, we know a lot you think we do not know about. You think NYC wants smog that bad, ask China how they got rid of the severe oil smog?
3220 2018-05-08 19:50:37 Ok you have your pyrrhic victory and u feel good...now what? Russia and China are not on board and can circumvent any sanctions..and u just raised oil prices which benefit Russia. What’s the end game?
3221 2018-05-08 19:50:32 Salute
 जय हिन्द,
जय हिन्द की सेना
3222 2018-05-08 19:50:30 …oil?
3223 2018-05-08 19:50:24 Putin's pocket has been dinged by Iranian oil exports. Oil is always the reason. Always.
3224 2018-05-08 19:50:21 It looked terrible on me by itself, but after playing around with different primers & adding 2 drops of @derma_e oil to it, it looks amazing! Not everything is for everyone, but sometimes you can figure out a concoction that works for your own skin!
3225 2018-05-08 19:50:19 “That’s a mans job”

Girl if you don’t let me cut the grass, check my oil, change a fuse & do whatever else i need to do in peace man 
3226 2018-05-08 19:50:16 We need  energy Independents period,
We have 1 of the largest oil reserve in Alaska let's get busy.
Obama policy literally destroyed AMERICANS
Economic engine
Let's rebuild now
Never let it happen again.    Vote Republican 
3227 2018-05-08 19:50:15 wht a dope u r/ Obama deliberately avoided Syria/Iraq actions after he fucked up wth the USA pull out/ GUTLESS COWARD which then culminated into ISIS/as the world was terrorized when ISIS had a homeland to train & plot/plan. THEN AFTER THY TOOK OIL FIELDS thy exported thr terror
3228 2018-05-08 19:50:08 Somebody wants the price of oil up. Any guesses who? And it is not Trump specifically.
3229 2018-05-08 19:50:05 Hmmmm well, It happen in all sexes. How would you feel when you state you want a beautiful girl, great shape, dimples, brains and all and you get the same response you’ve given?  everyone has his own taste and opinion so be it. Plus I can’t ignore it, it popped on my TL
3230 2018-05-08 19:49:58 You mean Israel and the oil companies? Trump has never made one good point in his life. Unless he resigns then that’s a good idea
3231 2018-05-08 19:49:55 The lady that did my nails put this dumb cuticle oil all over my nails and all I’ve done since is pick it off.
3232 2018-05-08 19:49:52 No...I used it to change my oil. 
3233 2018-05-08 19:49:51 Honestly that's America's wahala. Make I face my country. Oil prices will keep on the up and up and hopefully our govt will not squander this season. And if their country descends into handmaid's tale na OYO be that.
3234 2018-05-08 19:49:38 @realDonaldTrump  THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! For getting us out of the Iran Deal!!!  Order all the oil wells reopened and fire up those derricks across this great nation and PUMP THAT OIL!!!! Let's make Americans wealthy again!
3235 2018-05-08 19:49:36 US will import Russian oil next, the plan all along
3236 2018-05-08 19:49:21 Most of Iran's oil goes to Asian countries will have little effect in the United States
3237 2018-05-08 19:49:20 Trump's foolish & potentially lethal decision to exit the Iran Deal benefits Putin/Russia as oil prices now rise, as well as Trump-buddy Erik Prince (brother of Betsy DeVos) who'll now sell arms to both Iran & its neighboring nations. #JCPOA #IranNuclearDeal #Trump #PutinsPuppet
3238 2018-05-08 19:49:18 Just a reminder that Saudi Arabia is the one that sponsored and supported 911..but then again they have oil and lots of money
3239 2018-05-08 19:49:18 My hair hates coconut oil. I can never even try nje
3240 2018-05-08 19:49:16 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
3241 2018-05-08 19:49:15 :) they support every increase  of oil price
3242 2018-05-08 19:49:11 Standing on the Golan Heights one can understand why Israel can't allow Syria to occupy them and, conversely, why Syria doesn't want Israel there. And then there is the oil and gas that has recently been found there.
This needs a truly imaginative solution, not a military one.
3243 2018-05-08 19:49:08 Would you be proud of him when we block the oil all over the world?
3244 2018-05-08 19:49:04 *oil* prices
3245 2018-05-08 19:49:02 Donald Trump AND his micropenis can fuck off. Go spill your own blood for oil
3246 2018-05-08 19:49:01 How do you crush America you create chaos in the Middle East so they drive the price of oil to a hundred and fifty a barrel that will create another Financial collapse.
3247 2018-05-08 19:48:57 Pushed Africans in Zimbabwe off their land. I returned their property to them. Then, Oil companies discovered helium on it. What happened next?
3248 2018-05-08 19:48:50 make sure the broth is 20% chili oil minimum then you good
3249 2018-05-08 19:48:50 Mark agreed with your twt, big oil will not return to Canada until these eco-fanatics are gone.
3250 2018-05-08 19:48:48 Probably something to do with oil supply and money in the end, and backing Israel to the hilt.  Same old same old
3251 2018-05-08 19:48:43 US gets attacked, no one comes to help
Countries refuse to import to the US, prices skyrocket & products become unavailable
No one will import oil, gas prices skyrocket
Media becomes state run, call us N Korea, we are only told what they want us to hear.

How is this winning?
3252 2018-05-08 19:48:42 New girl: skipping merrily "well I get to leave at 3:30!!"

Me: why you test me like this, God?

Me: Ok then, why don't you throw some lavendar oil on that then?
NG: What?
Me: GREAT ! See you tomorrow!
3253 2018-05-08 19:48:42 Sold $EPE for 14% profit. Hoping for a dip to get back in. We will see soon $oil $stocks
3254 2018-05-08 19:48:29 Oil price is going back to $100. I hope Buhari can get to work now. But this is election year. They will loot everything.
3255 2018-05-08 19:48:25 The Saudis are going to sit back and laugh their ass off when oil hits  150  a barrel  again because the American economy will collapse again do you get it?
3256 2018-05-08 19:48:22 Now that the US is out of the Iran deal, Iranian oil is about to get more expensive. Gee, wouldn't it be nice if we had a pipeline to the east coast so we wouldn't have to rely on terrorist Iranian oil? Oh yeah, we had one until LIBERALS Coderre and Trudeau killed Energy East!!
3257 2018-05-08 19:48:22 Does anyone believe that Russia or Iran or Syria would Attack the USA ? If so why have they not done anything in all these years ? If you left them alone there would be no issues but they have oil don't they.
3258 2018-05-08 19:48:19 has anyone used rose hip oil? does it work?

3260 2018-05-08 19:48:18 Good evening @exxonmobil_jobs ,..well my name is @Chettah_Hamza and I'm Sr Gas Lab Technician From Algeria and I would like asking your Excellency if you will investing in Algerian Oil and Gas Markets soon or not ?!  Thanks !
3261 2018-05-08 19:48:16 US pulls out from #JCPOA....
Oil prices will be soaring like rocket....
Let's See
What measures will be taken by Govt of India to contain the situation....
3262 2018-05-08 19:48:09 You said that you have prove regarding the nuclear program of Iran ! So Citizens are waiting your prove because by your sanctions the oil will rise and the citizens will pay more ! As you promised to be honest, show us your prove, if not we will consider that your are a liar 
3263 2018-05-08 19:48:08 Guys, my best food is Plantain with engine oil.....
what about you???
3264 2018-05-08 19:48:07 Lets have some fun and bomb another Oil Rich country on WMDs allegations, if Korea agreed to make peace
3265 2018-05-08 19:48:06 @Are_weCanceled Yoo y’all niggas needa oil then chairs man
3266 2018-05-08 19:48:01 I don't care what it's called.  Iran is now free to pursue nuclear weapons.  Since the U.S. wanted to prevent that, why scrap an agreement Iran was keeping?  Iran was going to trade oil in Euros instead of Dollars.  This is about the Petro-Dollar.
3267 2018-05-08 19:47:59 I think trump benefits from the oil too.
3268 2018-05-08 19:47:53 When John Bolton says 'regime change' make no mistake, these are code words for war. They want our kids to go and die on the fields of Iran. A distraction from the scandals, and big $ for war profiteers and big oil. #SHAME
3269 2018-05-08 19:47:48  Nigeria gets something out of it. Oil prices go up.

This world is a crazy place.
3270 2018-05-08 19:47:46 That’s tea done & 5 mins of Yorkshire vet or lama drama as it’s now known in our house now I best go put oil back in front axle & hubs it’s service time 
3271 2018-05-08 19:47:44 -Μήπως έχετε baby oil??
-Έχω στο κομοδίνο, δίπλα στα χαρτομάντιλα και τη φοντανιέρα με τις καπότες! #GameOfLoveGR
3272 2018-05-08 19:47:41 i bought an oil diffuser and i blame @kylekuhns and his boujee ass insta stories.
3273 2018-05-08 19:47:34 Am sick and don't have chicken noodle soup but I found chicken gumbo soup and I added chili oil so hopefully that's the same???
3274 2018-05-08 19:47:31 Are you aware of the word propaganda? The shah was a puppet leader that was put in place so western countries could continue stealing all their oil at very low. The revolution broke the 100 year oil contract and stopped allowing BRITISH PETROLEUM take there oil.
3275 2018-05-08 19:47:27 Thank all that is good this witch only has 6 more months to 'serve'. But I have little hope the people of OK will return to a blue state.....too much oil and gas money there.
3276 2018-05-08 19:47:26 So #45 is dumping the Iran nuclear deal. In doing so, he is also dumping most of his European allies. Israel is very pleased.
Well, there's a lot of oil in the Middle East. Not much in Europe.
3277 2018-05-08 19:47:23 Brian, do you think President Shitstain's base will stay with him, once they see oil prices rise to 5 bucks a gallon and sees all the money going to Putin's oil companies?
3278 2018-05-08 19:47:22 Then maybe we get into another Middle East war and the price of oil quadruples. Then all the American oil barons, the war-mongering Repubs and Russian oligarchs win!
3279 2018-05-08 19:47:21 What are the Israelis doing building shelter in land they illegally occupy - or stealing oil from foreign territory too for that matter.
3280 2018-05-08 19:47:20 DT first needs war authorization.
KOCHs, Tx oil boys just got increased oil/gas at the pump money.
BIg investors KOCHs, Mercers in military weapons mfg will now be making even more money.
Enough of these stupid, insane wars for oil and money.

Bob - SERVE THAT DAMN SUBPOENA NOW.
3281 2018-05-08 19:47:20 Breaking (3:21 PM EDT): Oil closes down 2.4% on extreme volume after Trump pulls US out of Iran deal... -- CNBC
3282 2018-05-08 19:47:16 พุงจะแตกอยู่ละ
3283 2018-05-08 19:47:12 Offer China a cheaper alternative to Iranian oil. Hard to do since Saudi raised its OSPs to China and US doesn’t export enough oil yet.
3284 2018-05-08 19:47:10 Raise prices on oil. And he hates Obama.
3285 2018-05-08 19:47:09 Where is my oil dollars? #ThankYouTrump
3286 2018-05-08 19:47:07 trump  just wants a war in iran so he can sends soldier to steal the oil that is what america had always done with countries that have oil
3287 2018-05-08 19:47:06 จะเป็นพ่อค้า แต่หนูว์ยังพิมพ์ # ผิดยุเลยผัวกวูร์ ไม่เปนงี้หว่าาาาาาา #แชร์เลย์แชร์เลย
3288 2018-05-08 19:47:04 Defined: Irans oil exports were hurting Putin's bottom line and something had to be done
3289 2018-05-08 19:47:01 Put peppermint oil in my diffuser and it’s amazing for my sinuses! 
3290 2018-05-08 19:47:00 Yah .. this guy is always saying "oh refineries are down" .. "oh oil prices are up" so we have to pay more. Highly suspicious about his links to industry. When oil was over $100/barrel gas prices weren't this high. It's all BS .. rigged.
3291 2018-05-08 19:46:52 We're so happy to hear that diffusing a soothing blend is a staple in your bedtime routine, Olivia! Do you have a favourite oil evening?
3292 2018-05-08 19:46:50 My head is swimming from all this insanity. DJT pulls out of Iran deal. Saudi Arabia & Israel praise him. Bibi is as corrupt as Donnie. DJT sold $115 billion to the Saudis last year. Oil prices have been going up & DJT is pissing off our NATO allies which makes Putin happy. FUK!
3293 2018-05-08 19:46:50 Norway, one of the richest countries in the world, has in total sold 5% less oil than Scotland, just saying 
3294 2018-05-08 19:46:41 Anwar just happy oil prices will go up.
3295 2018-05-08 19:46:40 I wonder what will happen to the price of oil and the value of shares in defense companies as a result of this decision? Hmmmmmmm  I am sure this didn’t affect your decision 
3296 2018-05-08 19:46:38 So did Trump. Moreover he wanted to steal thier oil in a naked act of theft. Trump views America as a nation of pirates who are always out to scam the world when they need us.
3297 2018-05-08 19:46:35 Military weapons manufacturers' stock prices are all UP on today's news.
NATO alliance suffers another crack.
Rising oil prices will wipe out tax cut gains by middle income Americans.
Congress continues to shirk Constitutional responsibility.
I could go on...but twitter.
3298 2018-05-08 19:46:34 Trump has certainly shown himself to be a proponent of the oil industry.  If it's good for the oil industry, it's good for Trump.
3299 2018-05-08 19:46:27 This going to be another Bush presidency again?  Weapons of mass destruction being said to scare us, higher gas and oil prices, easy lending and in a few years another recession the tax payers will have to fix?
3300 2018-05-08 19:46:26 @serenawilliams all you have to do is heat up some oil, get some store bought biscuits, ideally the small ones, cut them in half, drop them in the hot oil. Get some powdered sugar. Apply to them after you pull them out the oil when they are golden brown.  Hot, fresh, beignets.
3301 2018-05-08 19:46:24 LOL..I didn't. I knew this was nothing. Iran is not that big of a world player in oil anymore & the U.S. produces more of its own oil than ever before!
3302 2018-05-08 19:46:20 Students were introduced to the Roaring 20's today! They thought my slang today was banana oil, but they quickly learned I was just the Bee's knees ;)
3303 2018-05-08 19:46:16 Trump is right, Iran is rotten to the core, it’s supported by Russia and the Chinese. Trump has balls doing this and he is right, it’s just everyone is shit scared. It’s about Russian gas and middle eastern oil,  the Germans, French,  British have vast amounts of money in!
3304 2018-05-08 19:46:15 The deep oil 
3305 2018-05-08 19:46:01 4 días después  pero está cagada la imagen 
3306 2018-05-08 19:45:58 Just combine a package of vegan marshmallows (I used @MyDandies), rice crispies cereal, and 4 tablespoons of coconut oil or vegan butter and put it in the fridge!
3307 2018-05-08 19:45:57 Will be difficult for EU to go around US sanctions, firms that does not deal with US can be used to buy and sell Iranian oil. A major rift between EU and US created by Trump
3308 2018-05-08 19:45:53 As long as they produce oil and they are Muslims it is gonna be #meddleeast & not MiddleEast #Iran.
3309 2018-05-08 19:45:52 Curent gas prices equal to last year - when oil was TWICE the price it is now. Sheer profit taking by producers etc. And huge shareholder profits when huge taxpayer subsidies. AND we should be getting off the carbon chain anyway
3310 2018-05-08 19:45:52 ยิ่งกินเบียร์ ก็ยิ่งอ้วน กินไปทำไมวะ
3311 2018-05-08 19:45:51 So now you have proved that the USA cannot be trusted to keep its side of any deal and that you are just a bully, you have just bowed down to the Israelies and to the other middle eastern countries to tighten their control on the production and prices of oil.
3312 2018-05-08 19:45:50 I love Design Essentials Honey Creme and Oat Protein and Henna shampoos, Silicon Mix Bambu and Aphogee 2 Minute Reconstructor, and Vigorol Olive Oil mousse because its super thick but not flaky
3313 2018-05-08 19:45:48 President Trump withdraws from the Iran nuclear deal--what does that mean for oil?
For more information contact me by DM.
3314 2018-05-08 19:45:40 Funny because all began 40 years ago, with rezah shah fighting for a good oil price whereas a pacific bearded guru named Khomeini promised a lower one ! But clearly USA is innocent as a lamb (vietnam, iraq, syria, lybia...) and can decide for everyone ! #IranDeal
3315 2018-05-08 19:45:39 I would venture to say that worlds leading sponsor of terrorism is Saudi Arabia but we don’t say that because of ties to their oil.
3316 2018-05-08 19:45:39 This is an event that can be influenced and will bring in revenue and PR. +ve news. Crime is being fought but like and oil tanker it takes time. I don’t doubt his commitment to the cause. Why don’t you focus on achieving something before criticizing others efforts ?
3317 2018-05-08 19:45:34 WTI crude oil price down 1.46 percent right this minute, but pump prices rising.
3318 2018-05-08 19:45:30 How are you, Bolton, Pompeo, and Haley going to stop India, China,  North Korea, Russia, Turkey, UK, Germany and others from trading Iranian oil for gold (bypassing the Petrodollar) same as they were doing before the current deal was setup?
3319 2018-05-08 19:45:28 You have to grease it up with Pearson's oil after each phase.
3320 2018-05-08 19:45:25 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
3321 2018-05-08 19:45:22 With the U.S withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the price of crude oil in the international market will go up. This ought to be an advantage in Nigeria, but the corruption/shenanigans of the @MBuhari govt will not make the Nigeria masses to feel the impacts. SMH
3322 2018-05-08 19:45:16 So..does this mean gas and oil prices will be going up? Backing out of Iran deal..good move!
3323 2018-05-08 19:45:08 KOCHs & Tx oil boys just got increased oil/gas at the pump money.
KOCHs, Mercers etc donors as huge investors in military weapons mfg will now be making even more money.
We have had enough stupid, insane wars for oil and money.  

Bob - SERVE THAT DAMN SUBPOENA NOW.
3324 2018-05-08 19:45:02 Pep, hate saying it being a red but what he's achieved at the emptihad is pretty much unprecedented, even considering all the oil money theyve poured in
3325 2018-05-08 19:45:00 E' Francesco Novelli di @DLA_Piper_Italy il professionista dell'anno per #Energia Oil&Gas, i nostri complimenti!
3326 2018-05-08 19:45:00 Of course other states are collecting massive offshore oil revenue but Louisiana isn't even close #ChangeTheGame
3327 2018-05-08 19:44:52 Or....I think even MORE likely: Iran maintains commitment to the treaty with remaining participants, Russia and China. The price of oil soars. Iran sells oil to Russia and China and is able to ignore American sanctions altogether.
3328 2018-05-08 19:44:51 Aww yeah, here comes our bomb-diggity Diesel-Style Sauteed Chipped Beef Faygo Senior Dinner- that's right, it's bathed in Honeycomb Tripe Shrimp Paste Oil and prepared to order!
3329 2018-05-08 19:44:50 Every major decision regarding the Middle East has been about just that: oil and weapons.
3330 2018-05-08 19:44:46 My car is in dire need of oil. But I don’t wanna change it, cause I don’t know how. Do I take it to autozone and ask one of the dudes to do it? Since my dad is still in NY till Thursday. UGH. The struggle
3331 2018-05-08 19:44:44 What happens to oil prices now and how will India be affected? Achhe Din or just more noise, din ahead? #IranDeal
3332 2018-05-08 19:44:34 Nobody is going to be so stupid.
Rohani/Merkel/Macron will keep the deal & to ‚nuke‘ the ‚middle east‘ - all that oil? Never ever.  
Before Trump nukes anything, his Generals will ‚nuke‘ him, with a pretzel or such. 
3333 2018-05-08 19:44:30 Rush to embarrass yourself you should take a que from @FLOTUS and #BeBest ....my tweet never mentioned oil from Iran....you just wanted to say something to the beautiful black woman huh....sit down and be humble
3334 2018-05-08 19:44:21 I hate paying for oil changes 
3335 2018-05-08 19:44:16 Now let go in and grab all the oil.
3336 2018-05-08 19:44:09 If you don’t get an oil change & you really need one will your car still work right? #askingformyself because I don’t feel like going and waiting 
3337 2018-05-08 19:44:05 he’s trying to get oil to a $100 a barrel to help Russia’s economy
3338 2018-05-08 19:44:00 National Interest

Just mere political tools...

The coups:
Against Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran > For Oil.
Against Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala> For Land.

Yes

3339 2018-05-08 19:43:58 You used olive oil and then put it in the oven? Or something new I need to learn? It looks 
3340 2018-05-08 19:43:48 Maybe #Trump's stirring of the world oil market's pot can have some positive effects. Maybe clean energy will boom in America upon the upcoming rising cost of petroleum. Just saying.

3342 2018-05-08 19:43:42 DJIA @GottaLaff and @nicolesandler dropped 150 on Iran news but Apple doing very well, recovered... Oil prices all over the place.
3343 2018-05-08 19:43:40 We know he never read the Iran deal or the ACA or the TPP. He hears stuff from guys who boost his ego & pretends he's making wise choices. The real question is, who benefits from this latest fiasco? Weapons dealers? Oil producers? Trump in any obscure way?
3344 2018-05-08 19:43:40 The Military-Industrial Complex, Bolton and his neocons, big oil, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China all win. America and the EU lose.
3345 2018-05-08 19:43:39 Of course Iran can ship to Central & South Africa and sell their oil if they got no one sanctioning them to keep their vessels away, those people would simply cook with it like in the early 50's & 60's in America where barrels on stands fed the stove & the heater esp Mobile Homes
3346 2018-05-08 19:43:38 I chose to speak my mind,I'm fed up with the mediocrity bn displayed,if it hurts u,kindly ignore it.
3347 2018-05-08 19:43:34 Lol. The only thing China wants from them is oil. Without the military back up (we provided up til today) China could go in and take It. They're not going to help them if anything they will take them out. China will not do that because then they would have everyone on their butt.
3348 2018-05-08 19:43:34 Sanctions Iran oar Russia par oar mara giya India

3352 2018-05-08 19:43:17 That’s optimistic but not realistic. I just finished working on a $17 billion project with a 40 year life span. No one will walk away from that investment with demand rising and a world thirsty for oil.
3353 2018-05-08 19:43:16 With the rising gas prices that will ensue, he is working in the interest of the monetary security of his oil tycoon buddies.
3354 2018-05-08 19:43:13 Oil almost all the way back up from its morning lows...
3355 2018-05-08 19:43:10 Oil dude love your vids
3356 2018-05-08 19:43:07 Super easy! Steam the cauliflower, then sautee and toss with olive oil, curry powder, salt, pepper, and whatever seasonings you fancy.  I used a little garlic powder and cumin as well.  Easy and good!
3357 2018-05-08 19:43:05 You mean the US now, right? If not, your post is incredibly inaccurate.
The US hides behinds suits and mainstream media, but the US is the party with army bases in 100+ countries and the party waging war on all countries not accepting the dollar for oil/without a central bank.
3358 2018-05-08 19:43:02 One way the US can show North Korea that it’s serious about denuclearization (so Kim doesn’t get the wrong message about the Iran Deal withdrawal) is to get China to cut oil imports from #Iran
#OOTT
3359 2018-05-08 19:42:59 OK, that's along the lines of what I was thinking.
It's obvious to me that the post I saw was aiming for lots of likes. To me, it's just wrong.
3360 2018-05-08 19:42:59 There’s a small chain in Maryland that are great. Wouldn’t go anywhere else unless I’m getting major work done @ just add on the oil change.
3361 2018-05-08 19:42:47 And it's a lovely distraction from all things Russia. And the rise in oil prices will make his Russian bosses very happy. It's a win-win for @realDonaldTrump and all of the #RussianRepublicans.
3362 2018-05-08 19:42:46 But it raise the price of oil and gold so rejoice
3363 2018-05-08 19:42:43 Less. The US loses allies. Iran builds nukes. Oil and gas prices spike. More money funneling into oil and gas dictatorships like Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
3364 2018-05-08 19:42:43 My Iraqi friend who’s watching tonight’s speeches about #IranDeal : “Hah...We’ve seen this movie before. During Oil-For-Food programme only ordinary people like my mom & dad who were teacher became poorer not Saddam. Saddam is gone but we remained poor and still suffering” #JCPOA
3365 2018-05-08 19:42:42 What happens next? The influence of Iran and Russia in the region grow, the influence and reputation of the U.S. in the region declines, our relationship with historic allies is severely damaged, oil prices go up and the possibility of regional conflict grows. Way to go, POTUS.
3366 2018-05-08 19:42:40 Let's watch how we are affected by violating the Iran Deal. I'm curious to see if oil prices start to rise. Also if we are closer to war in the Middle East.
3367 2018-05-08 19:42:37 ZIONIST ISRAELI HAS 400 FUCKING NUKES YET YOUR MAD AT IRAN AND YOU JUST WANT IRAN'S 175 BILLION BARRALS OF OIL RESERVES
3368 2018-05-08 19:42:36 Yes. And bad for Kafirs too. Saudis were being squeezed quite badly due to glut in oil market, which had partially resulted from Iranian crude entering the market, and were expected to run out of cash by 2021. Though one more thing should be kept in mind.
3369 2018-05-08 19:42:22 @realDonaldTrump message - "I have failed at business before. Go ahead & enrich your uranium, mine the strait, spike oil prices & increase tensions." Why renegotiate w/o nixing the existing agreement but, wait, that wouldn't align with your ego.
3370 2018-05-08 19:42:22 Oh and yes... the truffle oil.. that was sort of exotic...  #SialCanada #TBINChat
3371 2018-05-08 19:42:19 It’s all about the oil and oil companies.
3372 2018-05-08 19:42:19 Abiotic Oil infinity le supply of oil , oil can crash below 5 dollars and lower historic selloff
3373 2018-05-08 19:42:14 Oil industry puts a lot of great ideas (and data) out there, but take a look at the Miall paper “An event for every occasion” to get an idea where things can go wrong.
3374 2018-05-08 19:42:11 Iranian oil? Well the Saudis will be so happy, & you think that the Trump US are able to call themselve mediators? No, I call that putting fire on oil and blame the oil
3375 2018-05-08 19:42:10 To oil yourself
3376 2018-05-08 19:42:06 Yep oil prices are about to skyrocket which is the only way Russia's economy recovers.
3377 2018-05-08 19:41:54 not to mention the money that Putin will receive from the oil that America will now have to pay double for.  Do you think the base will stick with President Shitstain when gas is five bucks a gallon?
3378 2018-05-08 19:41:51 Wouldn’t it be interesting if Iran started dumping oil and gas on the market?  Good for our allies and bad for us.
3379 2018-05-08 19:41:49 Can't say I've ever stayed in my car for an oil change either. Of course I don't think I've ever had one I would call "quick".
3380 2018-05-08 19:41:39 nothing better than the smell of tanning oil  hellooo summer
3381 2018-05-08 19:41:38 @seanhannity    Dr Sadat Al Husseini, Saudi’s Oil Minister, called Trumps decision a very brave move on CNBC today
3382 2018-05-08 19:41:36 Trump's withdrawal from the #IranDeal is a next step against China (and for Israel and Saudi Arabia). World disarray is continuing and USA are the major reason. Oil prices will be going up.
3383 2018-05-08 19:41:34 Though Russia does stand to benefit if oil prices spike.
3384 2018-05-08 19:41:30 Oil going up. What a surprise. I'm sure that has nothing to do with the decision, either.
3385 2018-05-08 19:41:28 Was funny is when we use to be on that oil
3386 2018-05-08 19:41:24 Cool, he’s working on an oil platform.
3387 2018-05-08 19:41:19 I think all-cause mortality is the best metric, and in this study it was the same in both groups.  Higher cancer deaths in the vegetable oil group were offset by lower cardiovascular deaths.
3388 2018-05-08 19:41:18 People are justifiably well compensated to be out there. They are transported by helicopter. Being on a derelict oil rig by way of a helicopter... they're equally frightening to me. I wouldnt be  capable of writing my own name.
3389 2018-05-08 19:41:03 True. Vlad gets to look "good" compared to Trump, and gets his oil prices spiked. It's almost like he comes out the big winner in this. 
3390 2018-05-08 19:40:59 You have got that right...the only ally America's 45 will have is Russia...now that their oil just got more valuable...
3391 2018-05-08 19:40:53 To my last reply, I will add, it significantly benefits Saudi Arabia, with their upcoming IPO, by removing Iranian Oil from the market.  We know Trump loves Saudi’s Arabia.
3392 2018-05-08 19:40:51 I was thinking maybe they just a set up that auto-deletes anything with the word "sex" in it, but there were some undeleted comments in there before it all went down.

Down like a burning ship in an oil spill.
3393 2018-05-08 19:40:50 Trump will never dare to put his hands on iran . 
What is bizzare is that why americans dont protest against all the bloodshed their governments have led to in d middle east just to sell arms&steal those countries'oil  to keep its economy.what u feed on is blood.#luciferincarnate
3394 2018-05-08 19:40:48 The winner of today’s withdrawal of the Iran nuclear deal is Putin and Russia as all things Trump does. Russian oil prices go up and European leader no longer trust America to keep promises.
3395 2018-05-08 19:40:48 Are you referring to natural gas or oil?
3396 2018-05-08 19:40:47 I believe the real purpose of this is twofold. 
1. Appeal to less educated voters who think all Muslims are terrorists 
2. Drive up oil prices, helping the economy in GOP states like Texas and Oklahoma.
3397 2018-05-08 19:40:44 Thread: Another hot take on pulling out of the Iran deal.  So Iran supplies the 3rd most oil of all the countries in OPEC. We now can't get oil from Iran anymore.  What happens when supply decreases and demand stays the same or increases? Prices increase. What does that mean?
3398 2018-05-08 19:40:44 I am not putting on baby oil no fucking more
3399 2018-05-08 19:40:43 Oh, because Canada forces 17 oil and gas pipelines through the United States to sell Canadian oil from US ports to China. Canada defiles US environments for their own vulgar profit. USA should Ban Canadian Oil Pipelines. Shove em back up your own creek. #CanadaPipelinesOutOfUS
3400 2018-05-08 19:40:40 DT stated during the campaign that he wants war with Iran and that after the war he will take the oil of Iran in its possession. Success with that!
3401 2018-05-08 19:40:38 He lied to get votes just like HiLIARy. He knew deep in his heart he wanted oil & mostly he knew he must please Netanyahu his family business partner. Don’t worry they have to pay their consequences.

3403 2018-05-08 19:40:31 D’oh!  lesson learned. 
Don’t use sesame oil to stir fry. Sometimes to season at the end of cooking, but not during high heat.
3404 2018-05-08 19:40:28 Who is being manipulated by multiple foreign powers into diminishing America's role in the world.  Which also has our defense contractors stocks on the rise, with the price of oil soon to follow.  The second of which happening to be a major export of at least one of said powers.
3405 2018-05-08 19:40:23 Interactions I've had with my brother in law today:
Me, handing him a bottle of vegetable oil: Good luck with your brownies.
Me, taking a bottle of vegetable oil back: That was fast
Him: Yeah it was
3406 2018-05-08 19:40:22 Please. Go oil your barrel.
3407 2018-05-08 19:40:20 The country in shambles financially, protests for unemployment, cost of living, they spent all the money on ballistic missiles, we stop their oil, bam.....I predict Trump will once again be right!!
3408 2018-05-08 19:40:20 Why would the price of oil go up? US now produces more crude than the Middle East!
3409 2018-05-08 19:40:19 And keeps another one of his campaign promises; to raise the price of oil.
3410 2018-05-08 19:40:15 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
3411 2018-05-08 19:40:11 Family Nutrition: #Kraft Italian Dressing this May? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
3412 2018-05-08 19:40:10 Well, now that he’s done it he’s increased oil and gas prices (Saudi Arabia will be happy for that), but unless the former allies of the US can keep the deal alive Iran will follow NoKo’s path and build nukes before coming back to the table.
3413 2018-05-08 19:40:08 Why is it out of the oil industry? And even if it were, what’s the problem with that...?
3414 2018-05-08 19:40:08 Neoconservative nation building to own the libs.

I can't wait until we encircle Iran and take their oil.
3415 2018-05-08 19:40:03 If market was solemnly regulated we wouldn't have unnecessary conflicts over oil and sugar, currently the citizens are suffering the costs of sugar and edible oil simply because of few nitwits. #ChangeTanzania
3416 2018-05-08 19:40:02 หิว
3417 2018-05-08 19:40:02 Hidalgo County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
3418 2018-05-08 19:40:01 This will get “big oil” legislators worshipping $4.00 per gallon gas again! Yes sir, Mr. Trump is screwing his base again.  His followers are going to have to choose between gas for their trucks or bullets for their guns. What a great President!
3419 2018-05-08 19:39:59 Gold Oil and Dollars (GOD)
3420 2018-05-08 19:39:59 So shocking they turned him into Admiral Andrew "Peter Peachfuzz" Cuomo, a big, tough Italian.  Someday the Cuomo Navy will be as big a deal as the Kentucky Colonels and people will join in droves; right now, not so much.  Go get those oil platforms, Andy.
3421 2018-05-08 19:39:56 Getting it done at a quick oil change place so was already just sitting here for that. Didn’t think about getting out when I took them up on the rotation offer.
3422 2018-05-08 19:39:55 The oligarchs will be pleased. Oil prices should soar over fears of war/supply disruption. Isn't that the primary goal of domestic & foreign policy now?
3423 2018-05-08 19:39:47 Domestic oil production is at a all time high. The sanctions are going to lessen Iran’s impact on world oil prices. It’s the damn EPA and their summer blend driving up the price at the pump.
3424 2018-05-08 19:39:40 So my guess is that your buddies have oil futures. It's always about the money.
3425 2018-05-08 19:39:37 That's not real leadership that's real caving into the Israeli lobby and Saudi Oil Cartel. Simple as that. Don't try to make it into anything other than that, because it's not.
3426 2018-05-08 19:39:30 It also gets the price of oil up by removing approx 2 million barrels of Iranian oil per day from the market, significantly enriching his oil-based benefactors.
3427 2018-05-08 19:39:24 We are pleased to announce a new range of oil and transmission pans for Japanese, Korean and European vehicles. Email info@mtcparts.com for more info #autoparts #oilpans #transmission #repair #aftermarket #mtc #mtcparts
3428 2018-05-08 19:39:22 Strategy Nixon used. Book title mebbe 'US strategy re OPEC', by a think tank; lavender & thin. 1974. GOAL: use up the others' oil. US as Last Man Standing.

So, 2018: we SELL little brown nations weapons/reactors to kill each other, so we're free of them, wheeeee

Gotterdammerung
3429 2018-05-08 19:39:15 Shouldn't this send oil prices tumbling down?
3430 2018-05-08 19:39:12 Which precursers an economic crash. When oil prices rise, so do shipping costs, farming costs, medical costs. Welcome to the country's downward economic spiral
3431 2018-05-08 19:39:04 They can shove their "regret and concern"! Outrage and disgust at a blatant ploy to push up US oil prices to appease his cronies is what they should be expressing. That's BEFORE we get to undermining stability in the middle East and upping the chances that he gets his war! 
3432 2018-05-08 19:39:00 Studio dell'anno per il settore #Energia Oil&Gas è Gianni Origoni Grippo Cappelli! Congratulazioni!
3433 2018-05-08 19:38:59 selenas makeup artist did my girl DIRTY she was lookin too tan with too light of lipstick annnnd my girl looked like an oil slick wtf
3434 2018-05-08 19:38:57 Yes because they are shit scared to go against Iran, Russia and China who are making massive headway in the Middle East, it’s appalling, it’s about oil and gas, and guess what folks are government are backing the wrong side again! Along of course with the EU!
3435 2018-05-08 19:38:56 Maybe temporarily because the democrats fought against oil drilling, but the other option was allowing the “ Iran’s death to America cult” to continue building nukes so they could kill us all.
3436 2018-05-08 19:38:55 They don't deserve to provide electricity to a big city like Karachi they're unprofessional people with only one moto to send extra bill, they're charging units rates as per to furnace oil but using gas instead. 
Total corruption 
3437 2018-05-08 19:38:55 @tomwfranck He made it clear why he pulled out of the Iran deal. That country was using the money they received to sponsor terrorism and you're worried about what this does to the price of oil? Get your priorities straight, sir. That starts by pulling your head out of your ass.
3438 2018-05-08 19:38:55 No just Trump, Russia maybe China..oil...prices..
3439 2018-05-08 19:38:52 Oil prices surged to their highest levels since November 2014. That‘s good for:
RUSSIA. 

When oil prices drop, Russia suffers greatly. Oil and gas are responsible for more than 60% of Russia's exports and provide more than 30% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
3440 2018-05-08 19:38:42 You're looking too hard. It was to drive up oil prices for Russia and Saudi Arabia as well as stick to Obama. (not necessarily in that order)
3441 2018-05-08 19:38:41 The Saudis and Israelis will be pleased but Iran always sell oil & gas to China in exchange for dollars that China has plenty of from US trade and loans.
 
Who will Iran use as a third party country for imports of goods & invest it's money out of reach of US sanctions?
 
Russia.
3442 2018-05-08 19:38:40 Putin needs that $100 a barrel oil to keep the Russian military fed and mobile. Thanks @realDonaldTrump, you fool!
3443 2018-05-08 19:38:37 Yes. It is provocative at a time that it provides no value.
3444 2018-05-08 19:38:36 I'm happy to see @AltNatSecAgency is liking your statement.  Provides more insight into who they are.  
As for your statement, yes the UK had a oil problem which meant we would too and we stupidly helped.
3445 2018-05-08 19:38:35  I follow this cause my first car was a clunky, dented, oil smoking, 1976 Saab 99 GLE. One day I’ll buy another and fix it up. Until then, it’s for dreamin
3446 2018-05-08 19:38:25 The American people are in for a price shock for gas, and a way to relieve that shock will be lifting sanctions on Russia to help the world with oil abundance. Enough oil to shake the power of Saudi Arabia and OPEC.
3447 2018-05-08 19:38:24 hope they changed the engine oil, because it's usually where the fault is from
3448 2018-05-08 19:38:24 #Eurovision @bbceurovision #AllAboard Alekseev did a wonderful job of dripping oil from his tip and certainly got a hold of his handle firmly and give it a good crank! Impressive cog, too x x x #BLR
3449 2018-05-08 19:38:20 If you're too stupid to understand whatTrump just did and gas prices I'll try to explain it to you first Iran is one of the largest contributors of oil in the Middle East & when U stop that oil the law of supply and demand will kick in & you will see gasoline go up 10% in price *
3450 2018-05-08 19:38:15 @ManaosAR debo confesarles que mi mucama compró y probé la variedad citrus. Me gustó mucho!!! es cierto que no le pagan a la Afip??? Una pena, así no pueden ser una empresa seria, parecen Oil. Si se ponen en regla... vamos Manaos! A dúo con mi querido @martinpalermo07
3451 2018-05-08 19:38:13 As well as Russia & Saudi Arabia, with new sanctions on Iran, they will be who the US looks to for oil.
3452 2018-05-08 19:38:08 What if it isn't reckless, senseless and immoral(?). Those things happened when the deal was make. America First means we will not supply terrorist(Iran). This will not affect us and they will deal or not.  Oil we have, could increase the price in Europe but not ours much.
3453 2018-05-08 19:38:05 My primary follow list on the unraveling of the JCPOA and its oil market impact:

#OOTT
3454 2018-05-08 19:38:02 Trump your the worst president I have ever seen, Iran has got all the benefits of the deal and now we pull out, Trump your the worst negotiator in the world, just stupid, what’s the up side for the USA, higher oil prices, and all our allies think we don’t
3455 2018-05-08 19:38:01 From what I know about Iran Oil is that its full of sulfur content and only South America would purchase it not even the Chinese and they are truly hard up for oil esp North Korea, its polluted content. @POTUS who they got spelling out a wrecked future on Fox Business? Raise what
3456 2018-05-08 19:37:55 POTUS is already isolating them. Europe now gets majority of oil from USA, & our oil production is booming; Armenian pres resigned. Swamp-draining all over the world but media won’t talk about it cause you know, it’s Trump.
3457 2018-05-08 19:37:51 A large proportion of oil production in Canada is foreign funded as well. Are you opposed to foreign funding or are you selective on who and what gets funded? #cdnpoli
3458 2018-05-08 19:37:51 Eventual increase in oil prices to benefit Trump cronies, inc Russia and Saudi; payback to Saudi
3459 2018-05-08 19:37:45 #IranDeal. US credibility destroyed, Saudis get more power, Netanyahu gets his war, China gets discount oil, NATO allies get screwed, Putin gets higher oil prices, Trump and Kushner get huge bribes from MBS. Just another day in #TraitorTrump land.
3460 2018-05-08 19:37:43 63% of the country wanted to STAY in the deal. But you're only interested in paying back your massive debt to Putin by enabling Russia to sell more oil. Your announcement was full of lies and you insulted our closest allies. You're SUCH a fool Can't wait until you're in prison.
3461 2018-05-08 19:37:36 A great time to start investing in AMERICAN oil! #MAGA #MyPresident
3462 2018-05-08 19:37:33 Where you get an oil change?
3463 2018-05-08 19:37:32 Remove all sugar, booze and needless stresses. Turmeric soup is pretty magical. Elixir of echinacea is great for an immune boost. Gargle with diluted tea tree oil.  See you at RAH!
3464 2018-05-08 19:37:27 It can physically move the oil but any firm caught dealing with it would no longer be able to access US markets and/or face punitive fines, which rules out most institutions. It's the most effective foreign policy tool they've got.
3465 2018-05-08 19:37:25 BP getting scared of a country nationalizing their oil business is tyrannical communism? Not couping a democratically elected government? I've actually never heard a neocon defend their fuck up of Iran as "containment" lol.
3466 2018-05-08 19:37:22 To tie this back to Turkey: US sanctions looming on Brunson, potential S-400 sanctions/consequences, arms embargo written into the House draft of the NDAA, and now we are going to ask Treasury to convince Ankara to decrease Iranian oil imports, or force Ankara to get a waiver
3467 2018-05-08 19:37:22 Question for gun owners: Do you think a pic of an attractive woman holding a gun *and* a liquor bottle gives a bad message for gun ownership?
Serious question.

@Oil_Guns_Merica @ItsRobbAllen @RobProvince
3468 2018-05-08 19:37:21 One thing is certain, trumps action will lead to higher oil prices

So as you scratch your head looking for the big rebate from the #GOPTaxScam console yourself that the money you didn't get would have gone to the higher gas prices you are now paying
3469 2018-05-08 19:37:19 You need to increase oil production so the Iranian Regime gets totally bankrupt!

#RegimeChange by Iranisn & it’s Organized resistance led by MEK

Victory within reach for Iranian & let’s hope for peace in Middel East
3470 2018-05-08 19:37:19 Really? A oil gets you aroused?
3471 2018-05-08 19:37:14 Buy up old oil tankers, moor them on the Thames, convert to small metal rooms, no visitors, no tv, gym, etc. Make them hate every stinking day they are in there...and every do gooder that complains put them in there too. Sorted 
3472 2018-05-08 19:37:11 It’s ridiculous they don’t allow players to at least use CBD oil as an alternative to pills.
3473 2018-05-08 19:37:07 Dear Federica. The next free Iran will be more profitable for Europe than the pennies of oil that Khamenei pays you right now, I promise!
3474 2018-05-08 19:37:04 As a matter of fact I'm going to buy me a kerosene lamp and kerosene oil just in case  my lights was to go off just for back up y'all to
3475 2018-05-08 19:36:59 China and Russia do and oil..he selling US OUT..
3476 2018-05-08 19:36:53 InfoChip's rugged #RFID tag carriers can withstand extreme temperatures, exposure to #oil, chemicals, water, dust & other contaminants.
3477 2018-05-08 19:36:52 Putin has BILLIONS in this deal. 100’s of Billions. Oil at 80- hes in biz. Oil at 30-Russia totally screwed. Vlad wins with trump. Bibi blah
3478 2018-05-08 19:36:51 I can't draw but my idea for a Pokémon gym would be a steel type gym based around a garage and there would be oil slide puzzles and lifts. HM strength or equivalent is required to move tires as well.
3479 2018-05-08 19:36:49 Everything. Sad to say, I’m happy that the price of oil will boom. Economically, this benefits us here in Canada, and Russia, Saudi.
3480 2018-05-08 19:36:46 People who reading Trumps tweets: Under stand this! This blows up the Oil Agreement we had with Iran to keep their oil price's Reasonable! It wasn't only about the Nuclear Deal the U.N Nuclear Commission who went to Iran an said they were "IN COMPLIANCE" of our Agreements!
3481 2018-05-08 19:36:41 You know who else has oil?
Russia.

Everybody wins!
3482 2018-05-08 19:36:38 When do we get the check from Mexico. How bout repeal of Obamacare. When you taking the oil from ISIS. How is coal doing in West Virginia. What promises you talking about.The ones he made to his wife.
3483 2018-05-08 19:36:36 Literally I’d be so pissed if Marv forgot to get oil on my sub.
3484 2018-05-08 19:36:36 And to the U.S. as well as to all free countries. The reason, the ONLY reason the EU likes it is oil.
3485 2018-05-08 19:36:34 it might help to do an ice cube and then do your toner (witch hazel was my go to when i was really oily). you should also find a serum that helps with oil control, pores, and texture and make sure to use it twice a day (pressing it in, not rubbing) along with a good moisturizer
3486 2018-05-08 19:36:34 we have a very good business plan regarding crude oil for this month. so join us and avail this opportunity to earn in crude oil through online trading.
3487 2018-05-08 19:36:26 Someone needs to examine mar-a-lago members with long positions in US oil funds,  stocks and other investment vehicles
3488 2018-05-08 19:36:21 Republicans push oil n coal!!!
3489 2018-05-08 19:36:18 I’m Arab carat , have no oil guys I only have my precious heartbeat to svt lol 
3490 2018-05-08 19:36:16 what? China is the world's largest oil buyer. KSA has been losing Chinese market share to Iran and they want Iranian production taken off the world market. Your commodity markets lecture is beside the point.
3491 2018-05-08 19:36:05 Pole dancing squirrels! :) As long as it's Sunflower Oil.
3492 2018-05-08 19:35:58 Well that’s not a nice thing for you to say!
3493 2018-05-08 19:35:58 U r wrong. All this is valid for gaining and controlling power. Utopia exist only in books.
3494 2018-05-08 19:35:56 It seems likely we’re going to war with Iran. I guess we can afford more wars for oil & money but people not having drinkable water is too expensive.
3495 2018-05-08 19:35:56 Oil companies
Putin
Israel

(Ding) "What are three things that benefit from America starting a war with Iran, Alex?"

Trebek "Correct."

#IranDeal
3496 2018-05-08 19:35:54 Trump will get all the nations who don't like Iran and boycott their oil and goods they sell on the market. We'll stop any tourists and ban any of their tourists from entering our countries.
3497 2018-05-08 19:35:54 These are the people who were flown first class out of the US after 9/11. Saudi Arabia has close ties to the GOP and rich white America. They also have oil, a sanctioned Iran works for them.
3498 2018-05-08 19:35:44 @dvorakoelling The only reason that the Dow didn’t tank was because oil stocks went up in response to the possibility of cutting Iran out of the equation.
3499 2018-05-08 19:35:38 fucking oil money. that’s ALL this is about. Big oil death throes
3500 2018-05-08 19:35:34 And it’s not lost as much as deferred to when the resource is eventually extracted.  If we assume oil prices will rise then extracting it right now creates the opportunity cost.
3501 2018-05-08 19:35:33 Bunu çok düşündün mü we are oil
3502 2018-05-08 19:35:19 dolf fr scared me into getting my oil changed rn 
3503 2018-05-08 19:35:16 #Oil falls as @realDonaldTrump pulls out of #IranNuclearDeal - declines 2.4% #energy #markets
3504 2018-05-08 19:35:13 Oil companies plan to make the 1-person taxi much cheaper than the Drone Perplex, in the World.
3505 2018-05-08 19:35:13 We need to start upholding the laws and right we agree everyone has when we joined/created the league of nation's, I don't care if oil prices go up, we need to start doing the right thing, not the easy
3506 2018-05-08 19:35:09 Yeah that oil flow report has to be coming soon and borrow cost is down $ZN
3507 2018-05-08 19:35:09 When you go in for an oil change and they tell you there’s things that need to get done on the car 
3508 2018-05-08 19:34:56 ...now are fearing for their job as the company they are employees for appears to be collapsing from the top down.  (In unrelated news, oil prices increase more)
3509 2018-05-08 19:34:54 Money to friends that make war toys. This is a set up to invade & take their oil. He’s said he would do that before.
3510 2018-05-08 19:34:52 Keep reading.  The notion of "same enemies" is dying quickly as China builds the first ever oil futures market that doesn't use American dollars.  If the Saudis wish to be included in this new market, they too will have to sell their oil in yuan.
3511 2018-05-08 19:34:52 I don't cry over oil.  I use it every single day. As do you.
3512 2018-05-08 19:34:50 Sure it saves Bibi temporarily but Vlad NEEDS:

Much HIGHER oil prices.

The ability to sell weapons to Iran.

He’s playing Trump BIGLY.
3513 2018-05-08 19:34:48 oil price badega?
3514 2018-05-08 19:34:48 you didn't even know what coconut oil was until last week...
3515 2018-05-08 19:34:46 She for just stand rub oil for body, take picture. Smh 
3516 2018-05-08 19:34:46 Oil exports is not the main thing. Iran desperately needs western technology, spare parts for the airplanes, improving oil industry infrastructure etc. etc. If the US stops dealing with companies/countries doing business with Iran, there will be full embargo.
3517 2018-05-08 19:34:40 @AliVelshi @SRuhle can u explain: w Trump pulling out of Iran deal shouldn’t oil prices go up? Won’t access to Mideast oil change? It seems to defy the supply demand principle.
3518 2018-05-08 19:34:31 Sanctions on an oil producer.
3519 2018-05-08 19:34:24 US politicians are literally war-profiteers.

They invest millions & millions into weapons manufacturers & oil conglomerates.

They then extract the profits from their invasions on the Middle East, and they'll certainly bend over backwards to make those sales possible.
3520 2018-05-08 19:34:22 Be assured the Saudis will fill up the shortfall in oil post Iranian sanctions.
3521 2018-05-08 19:34:19 Uff,  oil going up. Not for  me.  I stopped taking tests and I don´t  have moneyñ.
3522 2018-05-08 19:34:19 No it's oil on canvas Geoff, I painted it in 1984 so it's quite an old one.
3523 2018-05-08 19:34:15 Oil prices already going up.  Russia will benefit.  Thanks Trump.
3524 2018-05-08 19:34:13 And yet Crude Oil prices remain down for the day!  And they tell us that the markets are not manipulated..lol
3525 2018-05-08 19:34:12 Also I'll add that the fact that this didn't really to 73-75 like it was looking like yesterday TELLS me that even the dumb dumbs aren't taking this Trump Iran crap seriously. This doesn't bode well for oil.
3526 2018-05-08 19:34:07 Not sure about the 2nd..never heard that idea before, but 1 and 3 HAVE to be done to get back the power from the elite few. I know unions had their place, but now their leaders are the only beneficiaries.
3527 2018-05-08 19:34:05 Ain’t nothing like oil’n up yah girls booty at the beach 
3528 2018-05-08 19:34:01 People need to stop coming to get their oil changed 
3529 2018-05-08 19:33:58 Iran's economy based on oil exports, their 5 biggest customers, China, India, Japan, South Korea & Turkey.  Wonder if US has any sway with those countries sans Turkey these days?  #USpoli
3530 2018-05-08 19:33:55 Hey Dumbshit, oil futures go up and gas prices follow sheesh
3531 2018-05-08 19:33:55 So we now know why Fat-45 got to rub the "Pleasure Dome" in Saudi last year: As part of his deal with Putin to win the Presidency, he promised to kill the Iran nuke deal; destabilizing the region & driving up oil prices upon which Putin & Saudis are nearly completely reliant.
3532 2018-05-08 19:33:53 Jeezus, Dollar Diplomacy gets a re-do 100 years later. Never thought about the oil angle until now.
3533 2018-05-08 19:33:53 Yep . Iran a leading supplier to US will a) lower or b) raise? Oil prices to US as result of Trumpniks racist based hatred abandonment of the OBama Iran agreement .  Iran is remaining in the agreement with the other rational countries.
3534 2018-05-08 19:33:53 I have issues with too much erasing and smudging. I have sweaty hands so if they smudge anything it just ruins the whole drawing because the oil from my skin is absorbed. Trying to erase it just makes it worse!
3535 2018-05-08 19:33:49 Doesn't Russia want higher oil prices, though?
3536 2018-05-08 19:33:45 Oil exports won't be effected. They just won't be in the public records.
3537 2018-05-08 19:33:43 Trump actions. Next:MiddleEast & other countries do away with Petrodollar & flood the market 2 force shale oil margins down.Inflation in USA
3538 2018-05-08 19:33:40 And the US actually produces more oil than Iran now - even if it is probably being sold at a loss.
3539 2018-05-08 19:33:40 Oil prices now skyrocket and President Putin is a very happy man. Puppet.
3540 2018-05-08 19:33:39 Gas/oil always goes up in the summer. I’d rather pay more for gas than give my money away
3541 2018-05-08 19:33:38 True but physically can it realistically do this? It would have to block the 'Strait of Hormuz'. You are an economist, so maybe you can tell me. Surely Iran can just transport oil via the caucasus through Russia?
3542 2018-05-08 19:33:36 Trump is just incredible. His draft "negotiation" asks China to buy 70% more real goods from US *next year*. He's scuppering a deal with Iran for - I can't work out why, to keep oil prices up? And the tax cuts. Is he terrified he'll have a US recession on his watch?
3543 2018-05-08 19:33:36 He has the money ,now you Trump show us the oil.
3544 2018-05-08 19:33:36 Our European allies are making money off of Iran, or buying it's oil. They will react differently.
3545 2018-05-08 19:33:34 So Trump wants a civil war so he can get their oil
3546 2018-05-08 19:33:33 Oil prices sure to rise too.  Good for Putin and Saudi.
3547 2018-05-08 19:33:32 It’s symbolic to a calm and relaxed state lol. But yes it’s an essential oil.
3548 2018-05-08 19:33:27 Ah so you don’t understand economics. Ok. So when the US sanctions someone that includes allies sanctioning as well. This means that allies have to purchase oil from other sources which reduces supply and increases demand thus spurring increasing prices.
3549 2018-05-08 19:33:26 Consider this, was this done to, appeal to the base but more importantly impose sanctions to stop the flow of Iranian oil and what it will do to increase oil profits of POTUS Mid East and American oil companies?
3550 2018-05-08 19:33:24 Turkey may officially follow then buy oil at discount unofficially
3551 2018-05-08 19:33:23 Also oil has been over extended imo since push over 67. Let the market forces dictate the price, not OPEC.
3552 2018-05-08 19:33:19 It’s “Open Season” on World peace & security...let’s start with the Iran nuclear deal...
And hey, let’s make some money while we are at it and hike up oil prices...
Furthermore, let’s continue destroying Obama’s legacy...
3553 2018-05-08 19:33:09 My 2c on Oil:  90 and 180 day benchmarks for putting sanctions back on, while likely negotiate.  Gives oil market “a Trump put” #OOTT
3554 2018-05-08 19:33:08 This was a huge mistake. Iran got its money, free to enrich uranium and more than likely Israel is going to bomb that plant. Welcome another middle East War. Oh yeah Oil prices are sure to rise. So much for our tax break. Russia loves this. They make money on Oil.
3555 2018-05-08 19:33:06 Check the price of oil; this morning when the rumor Trump might not back out was a window to cover shorts and buy when it hit bottom. They dint care about what’s gonna happen; nothing beats chaos for oil and gold; nothing
3556 2018-05-08 19:33:04 Peppermint oil is lit.
3557 2018-05-08 19:33:04 #abpoli #ableg #abndp  Why is it that gas was cheaper when a barrel of oil was $130, than now where a barrel is <$70 and gas is over $1.30??
3558 2018-05-08 19:33:03 I guess he scraps the deal and then goes in for the oil.
3559 2018-05-08 19:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
3560 2018-05-08 19:33:01 Undoubtedly the best trade today was from the cnn fake news this morning. #oil #oott
3561 2018-05-08 19:33:01 Oil man passed on the name of his watch maker.
3562 2018-05-08 19:32:58 Cui Bono? How about Exxon? "The price of West Texas Intermediate crude topped $70 a barrel Monday for the first time since 2014 amid fears that renewed U.S. sanctions would require international companies to buy less Iranian oil or face stiff penalties."
3563 2018-05-08 19:32:54 I knows!! I wants you to have all mines! I played all weekends and made my ears a huuuuuge mess so HooMum has put nice  oil on dems, den when dey brushed out I have to go bags 
3564 2018-05-08 19:32:43 It won't do you any good when the door is buried 20 foot deep with ruble. Modern day snake oil salesman.
3565 2018-05-08 19:32:43 If only I bled oil...
3566 2018-05-08 19:32:34 this is also about Iran wanting to sell it's oil in currencies other than petro-dollar.
3567 2018-05-08 19:32:33 Hahaha Trump will never invade or bomb a country that distributes over a million barrels of oil a day.  Never.  Guarantee.
3568 2018-05-08 19:32:30 Nymex Settles 5/8/18 - CL Jun18: 69.06 (-1.67) (+2.7% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
3569 2018-05-08 19:32:29 In order for Russia to get out of the red fiscally, oil would need to be around $100 a barrel. How do you get the price of oil to rise? Oh, wait...Iran...
3570 2018-05-08 19:32:26 War is big business, and the business of America is war. Their foreign policy in the Middle East has always been to create instability and profit from it in terms of oil. The military-industrial complex machine must be fed at all costs
3571 2018-05-08 19:32:22 If Iran is invaded like Iraq 2003. Israel, USA, Saudi Arabia will take Iran 's oil for cheap energy like when the Shah of Iran used to give cheap oil to Israel
3572 2018-05-08 19:32:15 Rising oil, makes for rising gas and all energies & raisings prices to everything else too and the CB's always want more inflation by default.
3573 2018-05-08 19:32:15 big *oil change
3574 2018-05-08 19:32:14 all products: crude oil and refined petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, etc...)
3575 2018-05-08 19:32:07 Cbd oil & a vegan diet should do the trick. Feel better, Beautiful!
3576 2018-05-08 19:32:05 Sorta. Again, I favor the Nordic model, which essentially allows for free enterprise while taxing it heavily. If I have it right, they tax natural resources even higher. I am VERY in favor of that. I don't see how it's just that USA oil companies pay so little in taxes.
3577 2018-05-08 19:32:02 When the price of oil skyrockets, Trump supporters will not be as happy as Trump's fatcat fossil fuel industry friends. Will his supporters ever wake up to how self-serving he is or will they continue to believe his ridiculous lies?
3578 2018-05-08 19:31:57 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
3579 2018-05-08 19:31:53 Once Saudi Arabia gets their tankers full from offshore transfer do you really think the price is going to remain cheap, hey they git oil up at $70 a barrel right now, how much you think this is going to add to the price cause taxing fuel costs passes to consumers like $5/gallon.
3580 2018-05-08 19:31:49 Israel Saudi Arabia Qatar United Arab Emirates these are just a few of the countries that are very happy that President Trump cancelled the Iran nuclear deal. They are happy because the more fear they can drive on your TV the more they can jack the price of oil up screwing you.
3581 2018-05-08 19:31:49 Just completing his part of the bargain for Putin, oil prices must rise.
3582 2018-05-08 19:31:48 Whose celebrating today? Oil Companies, Gas station owners, Companies that make military weapons, war hardliners, Iranian hardliners, Pro-Israel crowd
3583 2018-05-08 19:31:46 The $ was relief from sanctions and freed up $$ that was held from oil exports to stop the nuclear proliferation. The fact remains that Iran is a state supporter of terror and actively destabilizes that part of the glove.
3584 2018-05-08 19:31:46 I’m assuming it’s not engine oil 
3585 2018-05-08 19:31:46 The only reason he would give notice to anyone to leave the area is because he wants A war so he can "take the oil".

Why else?

45 and Pootie will turn Iran into a
 $$$$$$$$ scheme, already began.
3586 2018-05-08 19:31:42 @realDonaldTrump Iran: 1953-CIA and PB oil took down elected Prime Minister and installed puppet Shah with Secret Police 1979: Iranians rebelled against his human rights violations that U.S. was ignoring. What next?? and why??
3587 2018-05-08 19:31:33 I sometime wonder how many barrels of oil @tesla @elonmusk has saved for future generation in last two years?
3588 2018-05-08 19:31:29 Dear Alex, maybe look a bit further to the backgrounds. The Akadamik Lomonosov is to be the first of a series of floating nuclear power plants to increase oil, gas and coal extraction in the Arctic region. This is introducing unnecessary nuclear risk to exacerbate climate risk.
3589 2018-05-08 19:31:28 Of course, @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump the the @GOP want War. Get ready to send Donny Jr & Eric & all the Republicans pushing for this into uniform. THEY ARE EVIL WARMONGERING THUGS ALL FOR $$ & OIL.
3590 2018-05-08 19:31:19 Just for shits & giggles let’s screw over our NATO allies, do Russia a solid, disrupt world oil market and cause a big old distraction from the mounting scandals of the most corrupt admin possibly ever. Oh, and that pesky Russian  “Witch Hunt” can be swept under the rug of war.
3591 2018-05-08 19:31:14 US and British intelligence started the whole midfle east mess in the
50 ies with the dismission of mossadegh.
Since almost 70 year american and big oil interests destroy continously the middle east.
It was the US war against Saddam
3592 2018-05-08 19:31:14 They cut off all oil to japan 1940s and  they  were "wondered"  why they got attacked ...    
Iran got oil and gas enough to survive any embargo for many decades ,it wont be good for living standards but nobody will be starving if got supply wheat from russia
3593 2018-05-08 19:31:11 Yup! As it’s hardening. I also added highlighters to lotion and baby oil and I can say the Shea butter gives the best glow. The baby oil is trash and the lotion is okay
3594 2018-05-08 19:31:10 Trump screwed the deal that no other President could do. Now America is alienated with European allies in doubt. Now Iran has the nuclear program back. Gas and oil will sky rocket in America now. Trump fixes nothing for America and I mean NOTHING!
3595 2018-05-08 19:31:04 No, and they won’t care. Trump wants to appeal to his base and serve Putin’s oil interests. WH staff is paralyzed by the chaos and the upcoming midterms. They can’t recognize the geopolitical implications.
3596 2018-05-08 19:31:02 The country that will profit from breaking the Iran nuclear deal will be Russia, oil prices will go up like they have already started to do since Trump announced he was breaking the deal.
3597 2018-05-08 19:30:59 One should never use the words intelligence & Trump in he same sentence.  Like oil & water, they don’t go together.
3598 2018-05-08 19:30:59 El oil baja 1,5%. El mkt venia "priceando" esto...todavia no hay alcances claros de sanciones pero por ahora nadie supone q el resto se baje del acuerdo.  Mas importante sera el encuentro Putin Bibi para ver el panorama. O sea, un liderazgo devaluado.
3599 2018-05-08 19:30:54 I’d think oil would go up but what I don’t understand with this market could fill a warehouse.
3600 2018-05-08 19:30:53 Yes! Just ASKING what would help is so much better than being all, "try this pill," or "have you tried doing this diet?" or "my depression got all better with this essential oil." That's great and all, but I have a treatment plan. I just need support!
3601 2018-05-08 19:30:52 Oil futures suspended (delayed)... That's the reason... Seems we had a massive sell-off in oil and to calm down markets and crush vix they turned it off?
3602 2018-05-08 19:30:47 Hay una razón, y muy pesada, para no invertir 1€ más, la aceptación del peak oil.. lo otro igual es más consecuencia que el desplazamiento por sí sólo... porque ahí está el gran problema: la mejora de la eficiencia, sin olvidar temas sociales, geopolíticos, etc...
3603 2018-05-08 19:30:43 Sources confirm that an oil rig is in the works to be put in its place.
3604 2018-05-08 19:30:43 You know who the first person to gas the Kurds was? Not saddam. Churchill, in the 1920s, because they didn't want the brits to extract oil from their land. Admit that the empire is at best a mixed scorecard.
3605 2018-05-08 19:30:34 How many oil barrels did Iran sell into European + Turkish ports last month? 797k b/d to be precise, @Kpler data shows. This is more than OPEC member Qatar’s production.

3607 2018-05-08 19:30:33 Her we go oil prices are going to go through the rough, this economy is going to crash worse harder then it did in 2008. Thanks too this moron! Watch and see more Americans will be out of jobs. Just ask the poor farmers of their situation right now thanks to your dumb ass Trump!
3608 2018-05-08 19:30:31 @Carl_C_Icahn’s response to ending the #JCPOA:

So excited that @realDonaldTrump is withdrawing from the #IranDeal... 

I’ll make lotsa bank from all my oil wells & refineries.

NB: the fact @EPAScottPruitt just gave my refinery a hardship exemption... means I’ll make even more!

3611 2018-05-08 19:30:16 Trump has broken deals his entire adult life.  Marriages, business arrangements and promises.  He's a liar, cheater, con man.  He doesn't care about anything except for when he gets to go play golf again.  Those fools that drank his snake oil....shame on you.

3619 2018-05-08 19:30:03 Oil sanctions will raise gas and heating oil sanctions, and Iran will start enriching uranium again. Ummm, what did we win again?
3620 2018-05-08 19:29:54 I READ BIBLE, EZEKIEL 38 39, DANIEL , MATTHEW 24 LUKE 21  JESUS WARNED OF ENDTIMES..DOES MENTION PERSIA..IRAN?  KING OF N. NOW CONTROLS OIL RICH AREAS OF IRAQ,TO SYRIA, NEAR LEBANNON.. YEMEN, N. AFRICA, EGYPT,PLO HAMAS, HEZEBELAH..ETC.. EVIL TERRORISM.  OIL, OR  THEY NO CASH,WAR.
3621 2018-05-08 19:29:48 Because sanctions have worked so well in the past?

What do we do with allies who buy oil from Iran - bomb them?

Are you saying the way we're going to ensure that they don't develop nuclear is to go to war?
3622 2018-05-08 19:29:46 "Take the oil. We should have taken the oil."

Oil prices will skyrocket thereby making him & @arunjaitley look helpless, adversely impacting the outcome of 4 crucial assembly & Loksabha elections

@PChidambaram_IN @divyaspandana
3626 2018-05-08 19:29:37 If the Saudis are applauding, you know you’re in trouble. Not to mention, they’re probably counting the money they’ll make with the price of oil spiking.
3627 2018-05-08 19:29:36 Yep. This is all about Shartnado swinging his tool around like a big shot. 

Bonus: pisses people off. Double Bonus: oil prices increase so Vlad will be in sweet loving mood
3628 2018-05-08 19:29:27 He wouldn't be able to pick out Iran on a map. It's ALL about Obama. Get ready for gas rationing like 1973 & be prepared for oil drilling everywhere possible in the US.
3629 2018-05-08 19:29:23 How come this could be a catalyst if huge majority of Iran’s oil exports go to Asia???
3630 2018-05-08 19:29:22 You are a liar...  you are enjoying making crisis in oil market and economic pressure on Europe and China ... and probably recicibg some cash from so called friends in middle East... the cash that you love ...You are disgusting...
3631 2018-05-08 19:29:12 But a nice war surge is a great distraction from what's going on in the WH and Congress. And Vlad really needs the price of oil up. @ birds with one dumbass decision #RussianRepublicans
3632 2018-05-08 19:29:10 An oil shop that features valvoline products
3633 2018-05-08 19:29:06 I'm guessing rising oil prices will make Vlad very happy! We see right through you!!!

3635 2018-05-08 19:29:03 ...sell it, that’s why he led the complaint about Jesus being anointed with expensive oil.  I’m not sure what you’re trying to convey: yes, Jesus encouraged generosity but He also demanded lawful obedience. He didn’t set up feeding stations for all the poor, he fed believers.
3636 2018-05-08 19:29:01 Great decision for world peace. Bad decision for French oil company Total. Glad to see you stood up for yourself today regarding appeasing another dictatorship, namely the EU.
3637 2018-05-08 19:28:59 That’s exactly it with one more caveat big oil donates heavily to republicans and they stand to make out real wellehen prices skyrocket this summer
3638 2018-05-08 19:28:54 Never made reference to any of that. Just that China is the world's largest oil market and that the KSA motivation is to have Iran locked out of that market.
3639 2018-05-08 19:28:53 Netanyahu plan underway Provocations sanctions and waiting how Iran react
They forgot Iran a key piece for the China's oil and gaz supply and he has a defense agreement with Russia
3640 2018-05-08 19:28:50 Same as Saudi regime. Is Saudi regime using oil revenues on the welfare of its citizens or to raise the standards of living!!!!
Actually it’s the other way round. Regime spent a lot to maintain people hungry.
جوع كلبك يتبعك
3641 2018-05-08 19:28:46 Josh "Oil Tot" Middleton the beautiful photographer! Yet again you captured the best of nature and I'm loving what your seeing behind the camera! Hugs for "Oil Tot"!
3642 2018-05-08 19:28:45 Withdrawing from the Iran deal will have a much bigger effect on oil prices than Pruitt could ever hope to have. Today’s actions would be sufficient to line the pockets of the donor class. Pruitt is no longer necessary.
3643 2018-05-08 19:28:38 You don't think Russia won t buy Irans oil,won t sell them weapons won t support them in any endeaver to harm us.
3644 2018-05-08 19:28:36 US just withdrew from Iran nuclear deal and is imposing sanctions on Iran. Oil is expected to cross $100/- per barrel again.
3645 2018-05-08 19:28:25 Let's see if these oil prices go up....
3646 2018-05-08 19:28:22 @EKOELECTRICITY pls what is happening in Ilasan by World Oil! Totally loosing my mind... almost one week of no power! What is the issue?!!?
3647 2018-05-08 19:28:19 Trump needs low domestic US oil prices. That blunts Russia's advantage. And much of Russia's energy infrastructure is in such bad shape there are also questions about how much it can export
3648 2018-05-08 19:28:15 from my #life experiences in the #Oil and #Gas Services I realized one thing very #Important When you #love your #job, everything seems easy in front of You !
3649 2018-05-08 19:28:13 One of my mam’s students from the Middle East sent a present to her office for me and the note said

“For Dr. Moore’s daughter so that she may marry a nice man”

It’s just lip balm and cuticle oil?? I’m so,??
3650 2018-05-08 19:28:11 @MSignorile i feel like I'm in the sixties and seventies again where the rich are going to make money off of the oil restrictions and it's a good way to get rid of all the younger kids by sending them to war and letting them die? War seems like a win-win for the Republicans.
3651 2018-05-08 19:28:09 Russia talks and talks and talks.  Yet, they don't deliver the needed systems to Iran or Syria.  In an odd way I think Russia wants the USA to attack Iran.  They know it would be a total failure that would send oil to the moon and destroy AngloZionism.
3652 2018-05-08 19:27:54 Oil down on news of the pullout
3653 2018-05-08 19:27:53 Alberta should just stop the flow of oil to BC what are you going to do then. Remember even toys require oil, anything that has plastic. As far as emissions until the huge pollutants cut back in Russia, India and China our cuts are in significant.
3654 2018-05-08 19:27:51 Thanks to @ssmshah for helping one of my growers understand that my approach to flea beetle control in oil Seed rape could work!
3655 2018-05-08 19:27:49 Iran Ships 95% of Its Oil to Asia, Turkey and Europe.

None of their client nations will follow the U.S. cancellation of the Iran deal
3656 2018-05-08 19:27:47 Israel is dragging US to go after Iran and being successful in doing so! #sad Remember sanctions never hurt Iran’s economy cuz it can sustain itself, but this kind of involvement will have big prices to pay! #oil #energy
3657 2018-05-08 19:27:46 I disagree.  There was one other reason for doing it.  It will raise worldwide oil prices, which will provide a shot in the arm to Russian regime he has been unable to undo sanctions on.
Vlad's investment paying off.
3658 2018-05-08 19:27:44 can you imagine the drama they’d make actually departing taking all the oil with them
3659 2018-05-08 19:27:41 What's happening is Sanction on Iran puts strangle hold on their Oil Production!? Steps in Russia Putin will now try to service those markets! Hence Trumps withdrawal 
3660 2018-05-08 19:27:37 Saudi Arabia owns the big oil refinery in America, there is a stock pile occurring of oil on oil tankers held offshore in many countries & slack in movement of oil, really who is Iran to sell at a discount when no one can do business with them in the USA, crazy misleading verses.
3661 2018-05-08 19:27:37 Your daddy just told the world, we don't keep our word. He could have kept that agreement in place & started new talks regarding ballistic missiles etc. Of course Russia will be happy. They need the price of crude oil to rise to $100 a barrel. This is a big win for them.
3662 2018-05-08 19:27:35 Iran has 100 billion worth of oil to sell. Russia has 10 trillion in oil it can't  reach without American oil technology.  #PayAttention
3663 2018-05-08 19:27:34 War mongers are out for blood & oil
3664 2018-05-08 19:27:32 Oil is Earths Melanin
3665 2018-05-08 19:27:26 Americans regrets the GENOCIDE and Continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West for EU stolen oil.#MAGA
3666 2018-05-08 19:27:16 Gonna piss Tillerson off - he was hoping to be loaned the USMC to go to Venezuela and repatriate his oil that lies beneath the country.  Can't see the orange shitgibbon ok'ing that now ........
3667 2018-05-08 19:27:13 You are playing down the other key factor. Pretend to stop is not good enough for Israel - The eternal () Ally of US.

For them, oil can go to blazes - cripple Tehran's capabilities. Dazaal
3668 2018-05-08 19:27:12 WHY IS #BRITISHGOVT  SO WICKED & EVIL AGAINST HUMANITY ??? IN 1967_7O BRITISH GOVT SUPPORTED THEIR OWN CREATION IN AFRICA CALLED ONE NIGERIA TO KILLED 3.5 MILLION #BIAFRANS BECAUSE OF BIAFRA OIL & GAS
3669 2018-05-08 19:27:07 Prediction: just as gas prices reach unprecedented highs and people are about to take to the golf courses hunting fat, white guys in polos. Donnie 2-scoops will hammer out a deal with Vlad the Saviour to forever leave the US dependent on Russian oil. (For a modest cut, of course)
3670 2018-05-08 19:27:02 They can’t do shit the only thing this means is trumps base w b happy bc it was obamas deal and they hate him bc he’s black and big oil wil b happy who btw contributes to republicans and trump
3671 2018-05-08 19:26:59 The silver lining Is that it will be easier to drill and steal the oil.
3672 2018-05-08 19:26:59 Not necessarily for oil but for trade in general.  Currency swap agreement was signed late last year and this year already local currency LCs have been issued.  So, that's a positive thing.  Politically and economically Mr. Erdogan's continuation seems to be the best for Iran.
3673 2018-05-08 19:26:44 Ba dole ai
3674 2018-05-08 19:26:41 I was raving to my coworker about how much I loved her chakra bracelet and today she surprised me with my own along with stress ease essential oil to put on it   I’m so blessed. This oil is already working its magic 
3675 2018-05-08 19:26:36 do you think the base will stick with President Shitstain when they see Putin raking in the cash from the oil that America will have to pay double for?
3676 2018-05-08 19:26:33 Israel will provoke Iran into war. U.S. & Saudi Arabia will join in.  Russia will back Iran.  Koch Bros & Putin will get richer with higher oil prices. The U.S. Military Industrial Complex will get richer.  The big losers?  The American people.
3677 2018-05-08 19:26:33 It's George W Bush Iraq War all over again.
Trump,Bolton,Giuliani and the ISRAELIS all want War/Regime Change and Iran's 4th largest oil reserves in the world
Trump has said we win Wars but we don't keep the oil Billionaires are going to WIN. American lives will be LOST AGAIN !
3678 2018-05-08 19:26:32 Profit from higher oil prices.
3679 2018-05-08 19:26:31 Exactly. War is a necessity to get rid of excess population and keep control of means of production and make money for the elites.
Oil spike will do wonders for Saudi and American oil sales alone now. 

Ought to be a better way.
3680 2018-05-08 19:26:21 Time to Primary your corrupt, Big Ag Rice Corp Puppet, behind. Thanks, Oil is starting to spike as I tweet. The winners here are your profit hungry buddies domestic Big Oil and the Military Industrial Complex. The losers , WE THE PEOPLE.  RESIST LAMALFA, DONT VOTE FOR A HATER
3681 2018-05-08 19:26:15 use toothpaste or tea tree oil 
3682 2018-05-08 19:26:08 What the hell are you talking about?  Do you not think Iran won't "sanction" us by canning the $19 billion dollar deal with Boeing, or big $ gas field development deals.  Do you not think they'll slow oil production which will mean YOU will pay more at the pump? Use your brain.
3683 2018-05-08 19:26:07 Ya sheikh   
3684 2018-05-08 19:26:06 WTF is oil falling on this news? No deal = instability. #OOTT
3685 2018-05-08 19:26:05 I'm sure that's part of the calculation but they know that much of the world won't be on board for new sanctions after the US broke the current deal. A war that destroyed Iran's oil production on the other hand...
3686 2018-05-08 19:25:59 Watch the cost of oil go up. Ask who benefits and how this connects to and benefits President Trump.
3687 2018-05-08 19:25:56 Yesssss for real , I feel like a lot of people who tan hell’s dark with tanning oil and beds, deep down want to feel like a minority .
3688 2018-05-08 19:25:54 Hey now you can complete the greater Israeli project bush started 6 down 1 to Go! Our sons and daughters fighting for land oil and regime change for Israel! This has to be the most treasonist act in history! Making evil look good and good look evil!
3689 2018-05-08 19:25:52 I wonder how much oil money Trump and his crooked Posse are going to make from this deal.
3690 2018-05-08 19:25:50 @CNBCJou @RonnieChopra1 @afneil @truemagic68
oil clicking up 

Saudi happy 

Usa exports -- even Russia beneficial
3691 2018-05-08 19:25:44 It makes them crispier than butter or oil because the bread doesn't saturate with the oil.
3692 2018-05-08 19:25:41 They want Putin’s oil to be more valuable.  The end.
3693 2018-05-08 19:25:39 Literally gonna butter my skin with virgin coconut oil every night bc wow the condition it's heading to.
3694 2018-05-08 19:25:31 Of course Putin's happy.  Have you seen what's happened to the price of a barrel of oil since Trump opened his maw?  I'm not going to be able to afford to start my car, let alone drive it if it keeps going.
3695 2018-05-08 19:25:28 Much of the narrative is historical and pre-deal based.
How much of this is based on oil pipeline race between pro-US and pro-Russian interests?
3696 2018-05-08 19:25:27 Don't forget the British, was us whining about nationalised oil that convinced CIA.
3697 2018-05-08 19:25:20 A reason to go to war & has visions of invading & taking their oil. He harped on that all during his campaign.
3698 2018-05-08 19:25:17 Yes. I know. But Jesus is speaking of spirituality, not material things here. The eye of the needle is where this began, and Jesus’ warning to people not to continue their (Jewish) doctrine that God favors the rich. It is likely Judas was thinking he could steal the oil and...
3699 2018-05-08 19:24:51 A lot of folks who don't like being called, "Big Ag" sure like injecting a little emotional knee jerk into their own fighting words with "Big Oil" these days.
3700 2018-05-08 19:24:44 PMB all d way.  When crude oil was abt $170 per barrel,  dey couldn't buy 1. Here @ less than $70, PMB bought 12 tucano without using CAN private jet to move cash to South Africa.
3701 2018-05-08 19:24:44 Better fill your tanks up now, top oil executives expect gas prices to start having a steady rise because of this deal.
3702 2018-05-08 19:24:41 What will PM Narendra Modi do now?
Will Modi stop importing Oil & Gas from Iran now?
Will Modi scrap the Chabahar port deal signed btw Iran & India?
Trump has said he will sanction any country doing business with Iran.
3703 2018-05-08 19:24:38 The market was so sure that @POTUS is dumb enough to cancel the Iran deal that oil prices had already gone up to 70. Not going further as its not a big impact. Let's see what EU does next.
3704 2018-05-08 19:24:36 Ur so right! Dr. Sadad Al Husseini has HIS own agenda that mirrors Saudia Arabia's: OIL, MONEY, POWER. Then 2, the USA deserves a better government then we have n let's add Israel deserves a better gov than Netanyahu, who is a war criminal that expects USA 2 fight/pay 4 his wars
3705 2018-05-08 19:24:33 Internet is first to go in WW3. I would buy gold, it’s easier to store than oil.
3706 2018-05-08 19:24:33 I’m I this only person that follows politics to know about trumps oil obsession!
3707 2018-05-08 19:24:19 Don't know where to leave this but Iran Deal failure means oil prices will most likely skyrocket, which won't do any good to Ukraine but a lot of good to Russia, especially right at the start of Putin's next term.
3708 2018-05-08 19:24:16 #TRCM: Benjamin Dachis of @CDHoweInstitute "the oil sands are a
critical part of the Canadian economy. When it comes to the economic costs of
not building pipelines, they’re numerous." #S245 #SenCA #cdnpoli
3709 2018-05-08 19:24:14 Will Ouyahia be the first victim in #Algeria of rising oil prices ?
3710 2018-05-08 19:24:10 This press conference brought to you by Big Oil.
3711 2018-05-08 19:24:09 Israel and USA are same.
Both dont keep their trust.
And politically hypocrites.
USA is always afta oil stuffs.
I dont believe USA Israel dont av hidden agenda.
Vry soon they will trigger war in iran
3712 2018-05-08 19:24:06 @MSNBC The money that some Americans received in the Tax Cut will now go into the gas tank due to increasing costs of oil.
3713 2018-05-08 19:23:57 WITH THE ENDING OF THE IRAN NUKE DEAL TWO THINGS WILL NOW HAPPEN ONE OIL PRICES WILL RISE AND TWO AMERICA WILL BE CLOSER TO WAR THAN EVER
3714 2018-05-08 19:23:55 This was a huge mistake. Iran got its money, free to enrich uranium and more than likely Israel is going to bomb that plant. Welcome another middle East War. Oh yeah Oil prices are sure to rise. So much for our tax break. Russia loves this. They make money on Oil.
3715 2018-05-08 19:23:55 true i usually just make veg fried rice but i add so much oil
3716 2018-05-08 19:23:54 ANYWAY let's focus on the positive. This has made Russia's influence in the middle east SOLID. Iran will now have to side with them. Russian oil will also now become *suspiciously* cheap (they're already building a $30bn pipleline to Iran..funny that!)
3717 2018-05-08 19:23:54 Iranians very strong, even in the most difficult conditions, despite the oil, they have experienced a harder life than this
3718 2018-05-08 19:23:53 Xrp and oil will start growing
3719 2018-05-08 19:23:49 Russian golden showers, Saudi oil and most importantly general arrogance and ignorance. Rex was certainly correct calling Trump on what he is!
3720 2018-05-08 19:23:46 Long Crude oil
3721 2018-05-08 19:23:44 yes, that's why we're still in Iceland too, all their oil

you have an axe to grind and I'm not the guy. go bother someone else with it
3722 2018-05-08 19:23:44 i've got a 'house brand' of essential oil that i've been slinging if you catch my drift
3723 2018-05-08 19:23:40 Hey #Maga crowd, your boy just gave Putin a ton of oil money!  Winning!
3724 2018-05-08 19:23:39 No, Dolt 45 hasn't even begun in his attempts to give Iran nukes, raise oil prices, and do everything possible to create numerous global conflicts. Try pulling your head out of his orange-hued rectum long enough to get a grip on reality for a change.
3725 2018-05-08 19:23:37 The Untied States will seek to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil - Treasury Dept.
3726 2018-05-08 19:23:37 Witch hazel, palmers fade cream, Shea butter, then tea tree oil or castor oil
3727 2018-05-08 19:23:35 Seems  Trump is backing out of the Iran deal...

The two most obvious reasons I see he would do this are;

1) Further destroy Obama's Legacy...

2) Would reenact the Embargo on Iranian oil &/w Libya compromised this leaves Russia as sole majority supplier...


Another payoff...
3728 2018-05-08 19:23:33 I swear I can’t learn through YouTube only cause of how distracted I get. I just watched how to get rid of a tree stump with vegetable oil and cook dinner at the same time
3729 2018-05-08 19:23:33 Cod liver oil every morning. The end.
3730 2018-05-08 19:23:31 Maybe.  But explain to me how walking away fro this deal gives the US any leverage?  We already dont import oil from Iran.  They will continue to do business without the US.
3731 2018-05-08 19:23:30 came for an oil change, spent $135. &  that’s w/ $20 off 
3732 2018-05-08 19:23:30 They buy it from us at a 40% discount.  Most are holding their oil rather than selling it at this discount.
3733 2018-05-08 19:23:26 When Putin starts raking in the cash from the oil that America will now have to pay double for, do you think President Shitstain will hold on to his base?

3736 2018-05-08 19:23:02 Iran brave people left the dollar , staying with the agreement , owns its central bank and not under the rotchilds control , controls its own oil supplies , and not under control of American oil companies,
3737 2018-05-08 19:23:01 Oil falls as US pulls out of Iran deal. Japan's Takeda strikes massive pharma deal for Shire. And will Disney earnings be overshadowed by Comcast trying to win Fox? I'll discuss with @biannagolodryga on @cnni at 4:10 ET.
3738 2018-05-08 19:22:57 You should be getting 60,000 miles out of a set of pads. Does the oil change place tell you you need new pads? Or you hear the brake pad indicator squeal? Lastly, have you checked the brake fluid level? If that's low the pedal can get mushy.
3739 2018-05-08 19:22:56 Buying $PEY before earnings, orders placed for $MTU at .09 , $MNR .185, $ATU .37, need a dip to add otherwise will hold. Likely will fill $MTU manually if it doesn't happen. $BGM at 50% retrace tempting along with $VII, mostly a gas play with 30% oil weighted, but 58% liquids.
3740 2018-05-08 19:22:55 Plus they also get high oil prices. It’s political malpractice that Democrats aren’t pointing this out.
3741 2018-05-08 19:22:50 Israel took the Golan Heights from Syria during the 6 Day War. Israel talked about trading it back to Syria for a peace deal but US oil interests from Genie Energy have been lobbying the Israeli government that they might extract billions in oil from the mostly pristine area.
3742 2018-05-08 19:22:48 And Putin wins on two counts:
- higher oil prices
- A weakened NATO
3743 2018-05-08 19:22:47 I really wanna be a part time mechanic
I fucking love the feeling of oil and popping up a good to see the engine and shit 
Help I love cars
3744 2018-05-08 19:22:41 So many great memories it's hard to choose one.
But one thing my sister and I always talk about was my mom's "mommy smell". She smelled like Oil of Olay, fabric softener, and Chanel °5.  #FavoriteMomMemory
3745 2018-05-08 19:22:40 The Iranians were following the deal all world leaders say don't terminate this deal now oil prices will go up Iran could possibly go back to nuclear weapons, the middle east will be getting worse. Allies are putting America in a different place but hey #AmericaFirst right.
3746 2018-05-08 19:22:37 Just get a odorless wax oil pen
3747 2018-05-08 19:22:37 This is what Putin told tRUmp to do. Putin wants his oil profits to soar. Get ready for $5+ a gallon. Thanks tRUmptards.
3748 2018-05-08 19:22:37 Worked out how to adjust the bass treble and mid range on my new car today. I’ll do the minor things like oil, water and air pressure eventually. #priorities
3749 2018-05-08 19:22:27 The "con" will consist of a slight delay in oil price fluctuations, Russia wins in the short term, Iran gets to blame their future actions on the West and the UK loses. 
The World just became most dangerous.  #SaudiArabia #IranNuclearDeal #Iran @cspanwj
3750 2018-05-08 19:22:25 Been loading up on oil stock options contracts.
3751 2018-05-08 19:22:24 I remember the articles about “peak oil” and some faux rhetoric about shortages, but somehow that magically disappeared and we all forgot, and by “we” I meant the media.
3752 2018-05-08 19:22:22 Yeah, your taxes killing a 100,000 village folk so someone else can loot the oil... 

Never nice that much blood on you conscience, Jeremy
3753 2018-05-08 19:22:21 But, oil imports from Iran are minute. Majority of our oil imports are from the UAE.
3754 2018-05-08 19:22:20 So Trump just pulled out of Iran nuclear deal...economic sanctions for Iran..oil prices to skyrocket over the next months...Naija bout to be richer....2019 on ma mind..#getyourpvc
3755 2018-05-08 19:22:13 @AliVelshiOT: The price of oil was already going up due to investors buying oil stock! They had to put that CASH GRAB tax cut money somewhere,why bot screw working Americans further be inflating oil causing gas prices to rise 50 to 75 cents w gallon!
Thanks gop:(
3756 2018-05-08 19:22:12 CBD oil works really well alongside ADHD meds. I’ve tried & tested it myself.
3757 2018-05-08 19:22:08 When gas prices go up higher then they are already and they surely will, cost of groceries, every day goods maybe some of his supporters will get it. All the Saudi oil comes through straight of Hormuz good luck with getting it through. All this is built on a Effing lie like Don!
3758 2018-05-08 19:22:06 On the ongoing #Opec+ deal, #Iran's deputy oil minister Zamaninia said this yesterday: 

"Under normal circumstances, we always support the decisions Opec takes. But we will always prioritize our oil sales." #oott 

Safe to say, these are no longer normal circumstances.
3759 2018-05-08 19:22:04 I am sure he went and bout some shares of oil before he made the announcement. It’s going to jack up all of the middle class with oil prices rising and him and his partners making money. It’s all a scam
3760 2018-05-08 19:22:03 Russian oil?
3761 2018-05-08 19:22:00 They want to piss on anything Obama did and raise oil prices
3762 2018-05-08 19:21:59 At least, when the world burns once more, the end of oil will come pretty rapidly. Pump and dump.
3763 2018-05-08 19:21:57 Oil price through the roof on global tension escalation, Trump tries to flog US Oil to help bring the deficit down. Saudi's nominate him for the Nobel Prize on Economics.........
3764 2018-05-08 19:21:57 Now the price of oil will rise, Iran can get back to building nuclear weapons and no rational state should ever sign a treaty with the unreliable USA. A good day for oil barons, weapons merchants and Alexander Dugin.
3765 2018-05-08 19:21:55 RUSSIAN OIL is the deal here. #fakeMAGA
3766 2018-05-08 19:21:54 His oil buddies probably put him up to it ... he'd do anything for a dime!!!
3767 2018-05-08 19:21:54 #joke  After learning Trump nixed the deal letting Iran sell oil to fund more nukes & ICBMs,

one Iranian said to another,

“What tipped off Trump? The truckloads of info on our nuke program that those damned Israelis stole?

“Or our ‘death to Israel & America’ chants?” #jokes
3768 2018-05-08 19:21:53 Why is the US taking sides in the Saudi-Iran, Sunni-Shia conflict? This region has been at war for thousands of years. Can't we ever learn? We don't need the oil anymore. It's time to disengage.
3769 2018-05-08 19:21:42 40% of German manufacturing is exported but the US exports about 7%. Germany needs to develop 1000's of nuclear missiles, get a crazy president, threaten everyone around the world, steal oil resources and then apply MMT and run massive trade deficits at everyone else's expense.
3770 2018-05-08 19:21:42 So why stay involved then. Oh yes, military contracts and oil.
3771 2018-05-08 19:21:40 The oil @its_sheed uses @luke_lib
3772 2018-05-08 19:21:37 So we're out of the Iran deal,
No Iranian oil for us
No oil from Venezuela bc they're a mess
Where will we get oil? I know, how about Russia?
Oh, there's the Koch bros pipeline, off shore drilling and fracking in our National Parks - GOP pockets will bulge!
Watch those gas prices
3773 2018-05-08 19:21:36 God bless Donald Trump Only Hope for people of Iran whole world trying to keep iranian government in the power because they need money  oil .what about the people of Iran  being tortured abused and execute just wake up and help Iranian people not government
3774 2018-05-08 19:21:33 And attempting to calculate how richer he'll be with the inevitable higher oil prices...
3775 2018-05-08 19:21:32 Oh the McCrone Report is far more than just about oil.
3776 2018-05-08 19:21:31 Let’s spike oil prices! What’s good for Russia is good for Trump.
3777 2018-05-08 19:21:31 Agreed. Ricardo's Law of Rent is kicking in wrt shale well depletion. That's why oil prices are rising IMO.
3778 2018-05-08 19:21:28 "NUCLEAR or SUGAR/CRUDE OIL deal!"?
3779 2018-05-08 19:21:27 One protester has a bad day, meanwhile the avalanch of sexist, racist and violent tweets from the pro oil side continues.
3780 2018-05-08 19:21:23 do you think his supporters will still be cheering as Putin rakes in the money from the oil that the American people will now have to pay more for? They say president's don't control gas prices, but they do when they pull this kind of crap. President Shitstain is an embarrassment
3781 2018-05-08 19:21:23 $uso highest volume in a long while; collapse here is inevitable; Iran has nada to do with it; world awash in oil; especially here; $gs gunning futures in last three months; directly and through many dummy companies it controls along with the CIA!
3782 2018-05-08 19:21:17 @JayPhilips1075 how many of us work on our own car? I bet less than 1/2 of millennial males know how to change their own oil. The car isn't as much of our culture as it was 20 30 or 50 years ago
3783 2018-05-08 19:21:14 Same conditions for North Korea are in order if Trumps does a deal. 

Saudi's must pay their way for protection.  Not by spiking oil prices by limiting production! 

Peace through strength!
3784 2018-05-08 19:21:10 eating alone at restaurants? totally fine. eating alone when they’ve seated you at a very small four-person table with a couple, and the couple keep glaring???? sure, okay. but soon I need to use the chilli oil. and it’s on THEIR SIDE OF THE TABLE
3785 2018-05-08 19:21:08 I did an adult thing and got an oil change but not only did I have to ask the lady to take my key off because I couldn't get it off but she had to also put it on because I couldn't do it.
3786 2018-05-08 19:21:08 Classic pump and dump scheme, @realDonaldTrump rejects multilateral Iran nuclear deal, oil prices climb $80+/barrel, Saudi Aramco goes public, new bromance Macron+Trump announce new #IranNuclearDeal Trump claims victory, Saudi's have billions, nothing changes.
3787 2018-05-08 19:21:06 Europe needs the oil. Luckily they have the alternative of buying from us.
3788 2018-05-08 19:20:54 @FTMDaily Real reason Trump is puling out of Iran deal?
"Iran and Russia Just Revealed How They'll Upend the Petrodollar. Like Caracas announced, Moscow and Tehran are looking into cryptocurrencies as a means of upending the U.S. petrodollar's reign over the global oil market"
3789 2018-05-08 19:20:52 You know why? because of oil. By your metric, all the gulf arab states are socialist as well because gov enterprises (read state-owned oil extraction) represents substantial part of GDP
3790 2018-05-08 19:20:52 Iran deal  - Oil production & sales  - trump   & putin
3791 2018-05-08 19:20:48 Iran is sitting on one of the richest, if not THE richest, oil/gas resources in the world. Their wanting nuclear power for energy is a ruse. #gaslighting. The ONLY reason Iran would want nuclear power is to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. That's a no brainer. #KAG
3792 2018-05-08 19:20:48 The U.S. is importing less oil all the time! Canada could be a huge plus in selling our oil to the States satisfying problems caused by the far east!!!
3793 2018-05-08 19:20:45 Okay, doesn't destabilizing the oil market constitute some sort of "Now. Now it's time to stop him!" reaction among people with some, you know, power?!? @MSNBC #Inners #Maddow

3798 2018-05-08 19:20:25 yes...however, oil fracking is not a panacea.
3799 2018-05-08 19:20:20 An all-out multistate war in the world’s most critical oil producing region? 

What could go wrong?
3800 2018-05-08 19:20:17 The biggest winner in Trump killing the #IranDeal is Russia, a petrol state economy that is dependent on high oil prices caused by political instability in the Middle East. It will allow the Russian military to rebuild and have her nuclear subs roaming the oceans again.
3801 2018-05-08 19:20:17 How many countries does the US destroy before it realizes their mistakes! your opinion is baseless! Facts are that he kept the peace, you will now have to send your children to another useless war like Iraq and Afghanistan. Another republican massacre on brown people for oil!
3802 2018-05-08 19:20:13 Actually OPEC was tamed in the deal. We were producing more oil than ever.  I guarantee your gas prices will go up in next 2 weeks
3803 2018-05-08 19:20:10 Not to mention trumps pet peeve OIL?
3804 2018-05-08 19:20:07 Think positive! That's what Trump's new adminstration, Nathanyahue & Saudi's Prince, being all against Obama's work, wish 2 happen, but there r enough sane leaders around the globe who won't allow their wishes 2 come through! Incentive: rise in oil price too!
3805 2018-05-08 19:19:57 So we're out of the Iran deal,
No Iranian oil for us
No oil from Venezuela bc they're a mess
Where will we get oil? I know, how about Russia?
Oh, there's the Koch bros pipeline, off shore drilling and fracking in our National Parks - GOP pockets will bulge!
Watch those gas prices
3806 2018-05-08 19:19:56 Don't fall into the trap of defending the #IranDeal #JCPOA intellectually.  It was a bargained for deal, not a comprehensive policy. Focus on our future credibility with adversaries, oil prices, and the new Mid East arms race about to kick off. #Iran #IranNuclearDeal #trump

3808 2018-05-08 19:19:50 China will be a part of deal that allows Iran to do business with China.. and China will keep a blind eye on Iran's nuclear activity. Iran can get all its money from its oil export to China and US can no longer do any inspection in Iran.
3809 2018-05-08 19:19:47 The problem with the Iran deal is that it would not allow us to invade and start a war with them, and thus to again try and help Big Oil drive up their profits. So it’s done. It’s all so plain as day the ongoing con that is this iteration of the GOP. One endless con.
3810 2018-05-08 19:19:47 Sabes lo que es una promocion ??? Che Oil que onda ???
3811 2018-05-08 19:19:46 This is Putin's puppet only helping Russia by raising the price of oil. That's the only country that will benefit.
3812 2018-05-08 19:19:46 Expect crude oil prices to rise... Nigeria may yet profit #IranNuclearDeal
3813 2018-05-08 19:19:42 Am I being simplistic? Withdrawal from Iran Deal is a US/European showdown? Russia and China will not enforce sanctions... Are you willing to cut off the banks? And Trump base, do you really think the oil is getting cut off? Umh? My Portfolio is asking?
3814 2018-05-08 19:19:40 Iran deal had 0 effect on oil price.

Walking out of the deal will have 0 effect on oil price.

Why?

Because the deal never existed
3815 2018-05-08 19:19:35 For us, oil prices will go up. They are already up sef. Let's hope our leaders can use this season well. As for them let's just hope that their "envangelicals" will not drive them to a place where the handmaid's tale is their reality.
3816 2018-05-08 19:19:35 The real reason is the Oil Barns are desperate to get into Iran, Looks like another Iraq war  in the making. Trump is an arsehole
3817 2018-05-08 19:19:34 the scent of peppermint oil smells so good.
3818 2018-05-08 19:19:33 Lots of mosturing with Italian Olive Oil was needed to keep them from burning ...
3819 2018-05-08 19:19:32 I don't pretend I know the complexities of the middle East, but what I heard today is that pulling out of the Iran deal the cost of oil will go up. It will have a knock on effect on the cost of living.  I also saw Pompeo say April 12th Iran had not violated the nuclear agreement.
3820 2018-05-08 19:19:30 Why isn't anyone mentioning, the fact that Sanctioning IRAN's ability to Produce and sell, Oil/Gas, will allow American Oil & Gas Companies, to Produce more, creating many good paying jobs, in America? @AmericanOilAndGas ##MAGA @POTUS
3821 2018-05-08 19:19:29 Seriously, I thank God for CBD oil. She gave us everything we need to heal ourselves.
3822 2018-05-08 19:19:27 Oh but we have Israel! ?  God help us nothing like a blatant oil grab huh??
3823 2018-05-08 19:19:19 Sorry I don't understand your line of reasoning "Iran and KSA go broke either way." Iran is currently increasing its share of the huge Chinese oil market. KSA wants that stopped.
3824 2018-05-08 19:19:15 Yeah, it's not about oil prices. 
Americans (other than #MAGAts) aren't idiots, you know.
3825 2018-05-08 19:19:15 Trump decided to make a small present to his friend Vladimir and pull out of Iran nuclear deal. Say hello to high oil prices once again!
3826 2018-05-08 19:19:13 Oh that oil pipeline
3827 2018-05-08 19:19:08 Anybody ever used wild growth hair oil ?
3828 2018-05-08 19:19:05 I want to get better at understanding the politics behind oil.

I love trading it, but I haven't in awhile just based off fact a trump tweet can screw you.

3831 2018-05-08 19:19:00 Bet that orange orangutan is playing the short game on oil futures.

3834 2018-05-08 19:18:56 And ultimately, this is a great move for the US oil industry. Let Iran keep their oil. As for us, Jobs!! Jobs!! Jobs!!
3835 2018-05-08 19:18:56 So I’m making sausages and I’m trynna pour the oil out the pan so the sausages can cook better and my fuccing sausage fell in the garage disposer  god like you ain’t need that

3841 2018-05-08 19:18:45 What motivated trump to get out of the Iran deal, could it be oil and raising the prices of crude for Saudi Arabia and the rest of fossil fuel giants.  Oil prices are going up now and will go up further!
3842 2018-05-08 19:18:38 The question is how does it make Big Oil more money, allow neocons to drop fire on brown people and undue a major achievement of President Obama? That's why this happened.
3843 2018-05-08 19:18:35 Iranians have no reason to trust the USA. We and the Brits overthrew their democratically elected government in 1953 and installed a brutal torturing dictator, the Shah, so British Petroleum could keep stealing Iran's oil. We are as responsible for their revolution as anyone.
3844 2018-05-08 19:18:34 @chahn01 I don't think anyone is listening... so you can keep chewing on that bone.  As long as you don't have any solid info to back up your "snake oil" claim, no one cares
3845 2018-05-08 19:18:18 Who paid an enormous amount of money to Iran..so what about their huge income from oil money??
3846 2018-05-08 19:18:15 Not sure why people are buying $MRO these high oil prices are gonna kill their margins, worth $14 a share
3847 2018-05-08 19:18:15 True. Coal gets pushed to zero much more quickly. Natural gas interests still don't make carbon price a top priority. Never have. Never will. In part because a lot of gas is owned by dominant oil interests.
3848 2018-05-08 19:18:14 Say goodbye to President Obama's "Peace Dividend". The deal with Iran helped drive down and stabilize oil and gas prices for years and I'm sure helped average citizen's finances much more than the peanuts most now see in their paychecks from the Republican's tilted tax cut sham.
3849 2018-05-08 19:18:11 This was a huge mistake. Iran got its money, free to enrich uranium and more than likely Israel is going to bomb that plant. Welcome another middle East War. Oh yeah Oil prices are sure to rise. So much for our tax break. Russia loves this. They make money on Oil.

3852 2018-05-08 19:18:07 Would this increase oil prices
3853 2018-05-08 19:18:04 You are a peddler, probably funded by a hedge fund. Like so many others in #OOTT, you peddle stories and narratives. You are not a real trader, nor are you a real oil journalist. No go back and shine your fund managers shoes #WTI #CrudeOil #Oil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
3854 2018-05-08 19:18:03 The strength of the dollar drives gas prices more than any other single variable... The weaker it is, the more oil costs. This is because oil suppliers want .0607 ounces of gold for one barrel produced. Weak dollar means High gold prices... Connect the dots
3855 2018-05-08 19:18:00 #MAGAs jubilance is ignorant!! Instead of celebrating , they need to start setting up bomb shelters and prepare for turning over any tax cuts they received to the oil companies!

3857 2018-05-08 19:17:57 Anybody watching the price of oil?
3858 2018-05-08 19:17:53 If that happens, the price of oil and gas and gasoline will take off for new heights.
3859 2018-05-08 19:17:44 The latest MSM hand wringing and whining involves the higher oil prices Iran will use to hold us hostage.....Seriously???? Their main crops are sand and oil. That makes for a great diet. So let that sink in.
3860 2018-05-08 19:17:43 India continued to import oil from Iran despite sanctions previously. We have invested huge in Chabahar, can't  pull out now.
3861 2018-05-08 19:17:42 @realDonaldTrump Let's get oil below $60. / bbl!! Keep the (Middle Class) economy growing!!! You've done a good job so far,,, let's continue to get the middle class back to where it should be!!!
3862 2018-05-08 19:17:39 I had a dream last night - the air was heavily scented with lemongrass and there was a amethyst orb reflecting the moonlight. I know what I plan on doing today: oil pulling! Namaste.
3863 2018-05-08 19:17:36 Formatting part descriptions of about a hundred different valves on a spreadsheet... individually. I used to want to build renewable energy solutions. I woke up to find myself working for a company that sells to big oil.
3864 2018-05-08 19:17:35 Same as every year: beards, baby oil & big hair #eurovison
3865 2018-05-08 19:17:33 War or a threat of war in the Middle East is the best way to make Russia Great Again by virtue of skyrocketing oil and gas prices. Trump once tweeted that Russia needed help to rebuild its economy and this is a good way to do just that.

3868 2018-05-08 19:17:27 So we are gone sanctions back in place which means higher Oil prices a loss of our European Allies all in the favor of protectionism. Iran can now go ahead with their Nuclear program unchecked but you kept your promise what an Idiot.
3869 2018-05-08 19:17:25 The u s will never win ,the United States put a embargo an my country  50 plus we are still here and we have no oil  the United States gavermen are nothing but liers mentally retarded wormanger peace of shit you Nazi jwe lover.
3870 2018-05-08 19:17:24 Good luck with that. Is he going to try to sanction Europe? LMAO. He is starting a war and driving up oil prices. As all conservatives do.
3871 2018-05-08 19:17:24 @realDonaldTrump With the US pulling out, Russia is free to sell weapons to Iran (which they want) and Russia's oil becomes more valuable. How odd it is that Russia's interests somehow align with US policy.
3872 2018-05-08 19:17:19 Of course Ed this is about the price of oil.  May Macron and Merkel are not stupid they know what Trump and Russia are trying to pull. Americans seem slow to figure it out.
3873 2018-05-08 19:17:18  my MX5 was 25yrs old and had an ECU etc but it still needed a cuddle every now and then. Its nice to tinker but equally as nice just to let the thing run!
Oil changes will always be needed, unless you go long life. Depends if you get someone to do it for you or not!

3875 2018-05-08 19:17:15 In 14 mins I’m going to get a milkshake and head to Walmart for an oil change and meet up with my mother and idk what’s she’s doing but something.

3886 2018-05-08 19:16:25 Prices of oil expected to go up.
3887 2018-05-08 19:16:24 Yes I meant the oil & shipping sanctions. Some of lesser sanctions snap back quicker. Big question: if EU+2 convince Iran to stay in deal if oil sales financed through major/central bank will US actually impose sanctions. US has been hesitant to sanction big PRC banks for DPRK
3888 2018-05-08 19:16:20 Guys this breach of the #IranDeal was never about them violating the deal....it's about lifting Saudi with their resources (oil) rather than having Iran flood the markets with their resources...It puts a lock on the markets that favor Saudi, beneficial to American interest also.
3889 2018-05-08 19:16:19 Yes.  This is beginning to look as if it could fracture the global USD oil market into 2 markets...China would seem to be unlikely to care about this, & US sanctions swing the bargaining leverage to China v. Iran, & BBG said in 2014 all Iranian sales to China are in CNY.
3890 2018-05-08 19:16:18 Remind me of Piper bravo oil rig disaster in which safety inspectors forget to replace a valve.  This deal was a valve. May the blast don't happen. #IranNuclearDeal

3892 2018-05-08 19:16:10 At 3;15pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.
3893 2018-05-08 19:16:10 UK has oil too!
3894 2018-05-08 19:16:09 Iran deal is less of a geopolitical nuclear issue and more of a macroeconomic issue as it relates to oil prices. Iran (major OPEC supplier) is likely to dump inventory ahead of sanctions (reflected in dip today), but will create upward price pressure from tightened inventory.
3895 2018-05-08 19:16:09 This was a huge mistake. Iran got its money, free to enrich uranium and more than likely Israel is going to bomb that plant. Welcome another middle East War. Oh yeah Oil prices are sure to rise. So much for our tax break. Russia loves this. They make money on Oil.
3896 2018-05-08 19:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and residing in our country with dignity.
3897 2018-05-08 19:16:06 Coconut oil the best thing to tan with yes yes yes yes yessssss
3898 2018-05-08 19:16:05 @RealDonad_Trump Trump could care less about the Iran deal.  He just wanted to change the news cycle from all the corruption plaguing his campaign or he wants to go war to steal their oil.
3899 2018-05-08 19:16:02 You guys see high oil prices. All I see is $$$$$$
3900 2018-05-08 19:15:52 Can we have our cash back? Any oil on the sea we can confiscate???

3903 2018-05-08 19:15:43 Whoever investing in oil right now making hella bank!
3904 2018-05-08 19:15:41 Pompeo himself said Iran hadn't voilated the agreement. Trump lies again. Continues to lie to the American people on a pathological level. This will affect oil prices and trade world wide. There goes the pennies from the big GOP tax cut. Recession coming by the end of the year.
3905 2018-05-08 19:15:40 Big Oil is probably pretty happy with their boy
3906 2018-05-08 19:15:39 trump just wants an excuse to run in and take the oil
3907 2018-05-08 19:15:36 Bio Oil
3908 2018-05-08 19:15:29 no he likes relying on oil to rub on Steph’s ankle at the altar of a church. can’t trust those numbers or medicine, dawg!
3909 2018-05-08 19:15:27 Plenty of other considerations factor into it. Plenty of capitalists argue for public good healthcare, because in their mind, the benefit outweighs the cost. Some companies do the same for strategic economic sectors (oil usually). Heck, I'd guess that it's your primary reason.
3910 2018-05-08 19:15:24 Guess one might say we are surely fucked. Trump is a danger to our lives, our Country and the world. 
Time to dig the rosary beads out and start praying.
Watch oil/gas prices increase tremendously.
3911 2018-05-08 19:15:23 pretty likely US fossil fuel extractors need the price of oil to go up...it justifies their industry.  pretty likely fossil fuels and their infrastructure is primary force in US policy #banalityOfevil #roguenation

3914 2018-05-08 19:15:06 Fixing up work on The RhinoAg Judge. We head to Memphis International Raceway for Bluff City Nationals, first event of the 2018 Lucas Oil Pro Pulling League season. #pulllikeapro #borntolead
3915 2018-05-08 19:15:02 We are the closest to a nuclear Armageddon... #WW3 is upon us. @CNN @FoxNews $ES_F #oil
3916 2018-05-08 19:15:02 That is perfect what type of oil did she use
3917 2018-05-08 19:14:52 It makes perfect sense if you are Russia... send oil prices skyrocketing and sell russian arms to iran.
3918 2018-05-08 19:14:51 I agree. It is about oil.  The oil companies will make more money and our gas prices will rise. Are you happy you're right?
3919 2018-05-08 19:14:51 When you see the spike in oil prices, you will all blame Trump, right?
3920 2018-05-08 19:14:41 Would u like a an oil massage...or oil n then tongue ...full body..every inch...;)
3921 2018-05-08 19:14:40 Me laughing in Swahili... Nigeria welcome to the oil boom era....
3922 2018-05-08 19:14:27 Most of the Iranian oil exports go to China, India, some to Korea. Not much impact on oil price from US sanctions according to Saudi minister #Oil #Sanctions #Iran #Trump
3923 2018-05-08 19:14:27 How much money do you have in oil futures?
3924 2018-05-08 19:14:23 ITs not about oil , its about indy , and all you have to do is look at where Norway was at time of writing , and is today.

Lets not forget we have no heavy industry now neither , its like a manual for scottish destruction.
3925 2018-05-08 19:14:16 いつもRTAみたいに帰って原稿とかしてたのでなやむ 家にも帰りたい
3926 2018-05-08 19:14:16 You’re twisted I’ll tell you that. the last doctor anyone would want, with priorities that twisted... buy a damn Tesla. Or don’t whine about increased oil production here in the US, that you liberals like to whine about, since that will soon result in energy independence
3927 2018-05-08 19:14:16 Which? Iran took our people hostage and J Carter tried to solve the problem peacefully. But ayatolla sold out for weapons from reagan who in turn armed mujadeen reagan brought the wars because oil barons welcomed him and they are Muslim. Then w bush came with cheney and war
3928 2018-05-08 19:14:09 May I ask a silly question, @trevortombe? (one of my specialties)

Are higher oil prices actually good for the Cdn economy? We import a lot of crude and higher energy costs are a burden on consumers and industry. 

Just wondering if you've seen or done any work on this? 

Thanks
3929 2018-05-08 19:14:08 That's exactly what I said. I did not say that the US wanted to keep Iranian oil off the market. I said the Saudis wanted to keep Iranian oil off the market.
3930 2018-05-08 19:13:54 How long until Trump puts the navy in the Persian Sea to block oil shipments from Iran? And how long after that will it take for oil to hit $150/barrel? And how long after that until Russia becomes solvent? And how long after that until the US is in a deep depression?
3931 2018-05-08 19:13:49 @MMMNightShift We can make synthetic lubricants (not much natural oil in them, i think), why can't we make synthetic fuels?
3932 2018-05-08 19:13:48 Maybe, maybe not. There are all kinds of trade deals and swaps between Iran and Russia, which means Iranian oil can be "laundered". Plus, it's not clear the EU will succumb to US pressure not to buy Iranian oil.
3933 2018-05-08 19:13:46 Chili oil and garlic on anything lol
3934 2018-05-08 19:13:38 Do you plan on imposing sanctions on our allies who continue to buy oil from Iran? Do you even have a plan?
3935 2018-05-08 19:13:32 What kind of deal did the King make with Trump to slow down oil production?
3936 2018-05-08 19:13:32 i just realized i needed an oil change 14,000 miles ago. how bad is that for my car 
3937 2018-05-08 19:13:30 Is that a 'Castor Oil' Plant?
3938 2018-05-08 19:13:24 I have no idea. I also don’t know how modern I could make myself go! They aren’t a needy pair at all really, it’s just that nothing is ever straightforward and even changing the oil is something I have to do. I just want to drive them! Lol!
3939 2018-05-08 19:13:24 #NBSInvestigates  Please investigate on why Oil and Gas contracts are given to foreign companies for services ring fenced for Ugandan Companies. PAU, UNOC, TOTAL E&P and CNOOC should be answerable.
3940 2018-05-08 19:13:20 Damn, man, I eat salmon and sardines/whole eggs/oil in my cooking to ever not get at least 50 gs a day. 7 grams? Wow...
3941 2018-05-08 19:13:06 Bio oil is the real MVP! Scar is looking a lot less scary as the days go on
3942 2018-05-08 19:13:03 Isn't that cute .. an oil country praising increased oil prices .. huh
3943 2018-05-08 19:13:03 No dear, it just CUTS OFF regime cronies from OIL DOLLARS~!
3944 2018-05-08 19:12:55 ;)..
3945 2018-05-08 19:12:53 Iran's leader sounds way more reasonable than Trump, saying they will remain in the deal with other nations that are in it. Meanwhile, Trump's war mongers are drooling over a potential war that big oil craves. #Patheticc
3946 2018-05-08 19:12:52 That wild hair growth oil some shit ! Omm I’ll go buy 10 more bottles 
3947 2018-05-08 19:12:48 It’s like Martin Freeman has dowsed himself in Oil of Olay every day for the last 20 years #Eurovision
3948 2018-05-08 19:12:44 Juh micoud pan pyes gou
3949 2018-05-08 19:12:43 Really?!! Higher gas prices? Funny when Iran couldn’t sell their oil, the prices were down....now Iran couldn’t use oil money to finance their terrorism!
3950 2018-05-08 19:12:42 US consumes 44% of total oil consumption per year. 19.5m barrels consumed every day. But yeah, you're right, China is to blame for US air pollution.
3951 2018-05-08 19:12:41 @realDonaldTrump @cnnbrk if I remember correctly wasn’t there some communication between a Russia oil company and the trump campaign? Now no more oil from Iran . Is this painting a larger picture. We should step back and examine. Money motivates Donny nothing else!!!
3952 2018-05-08 19:12:38 Your periodic reminder that the Eurozone imports as much oil as China does. Where's that Brent contract in EUR?
3953 2018-05-08 19:12:34 Will China stop buying Iranian oil? If not, do the Americans put sanctions on China?
3954 2018-05-08 19:12:31 Thanks. But can I clarify, please? The grammar is ambiguous. Are you saying that only sustainable palm oil is used in all your products? And that you make no use of palm oil which is not certified as sustainable in any of your products? If so, you should advertise it widely!
3955 2018-05-08 19:12:25 Chemically reproduced butter? Its canola oil whipped into a spread. Butter is more chemically treated than your average margerine.
3956 2018-05-08 19:12:23 Yes bby love to be your oil boy
3957 2018-05-08 19:12:18 I assume same applies to French oil companies?
3958 2018-05-08 19:12:14 Also the money was from South Korea , India and China for purchasing Iran’s oil . So the money was theirs all along .
3959 2018-05-08 19:12:13 Are you kidding, You took the US out of the US/Iran deal because you do like President Obama. You have not thought this through, now what is your pal. You have worked to dismantle everything that President Obama did for America. Your true racism come through. This is about oil.
3960 2018-05-08 19:12:11 You can almost taste that good Iranian Oil cant you....
3961 2018-05-08 19:12:08 My Eddie just laughed !!!
3962 2018-05-08 19:12:07 ยาตัวนี้มันจะเป็น ครีมๆผสมoil จะไม่เจ็บมากเวลาใส่-ถอดต่างหู ด้วย
3963 2018-05-08 19:12:06 So do you plan on sanctioning our allies who continue to buy oil from Iran? The deal had many flaws but leaving the deal will have many unintended consequences. You announced to the world the US doesn’t honor commitments. Resign.
3964 2018-05-08 19:12:04 they will get $100 oil by end of year 

israel will attack hezbollah - the reaction Iranian support 

Refugees in Lebanon become human shields / plus poeple in villiages 
where hezbollah have built up their munitions
3965 2018-05-08 19:12:00 If you enjoy using a facial mist on your face while flying, be sure to immediately follow with a cream or skin oil to seal in the moisture. #rr1
3966 2018-05-08 19:11:59 Coriander essential oil mixed with coconut oil just rubbed directly on my stomach. It helps SO much.
3967 2018-05-08 19:11:52 I'm currently as annoyed at the whole Harris and company fame as I ever have been about the cult following of David Avacado Wolfe. 

Their snake oil is of a different kind and is much more palatable to the right. It's hard to truly measure which is more harmful but it's all bad.
3968 2018-05-08 19:11:52 Again, what are you going to do about it? Everyone with a brain knows all this - morally all you can really do is work less, buy nothing, get off the grid and don't use oil. find you're ilk , walk away. We're way past spreading information.
3969 2018-05-08 19:11:49 มีเวลาแต่ไม่มีเงิน กะ มีเงินแต่ไม่มีเวลา
3970 2018-05-08 19:11:49 By the time this reality hit such oil producing country like Nigeria, the would be too late.. Our leader needs to set a target of diversifying the economy and stop the lazy dependence on oil exportation.
3971 2018-05-08 19:11:48 Put phrases! Like “Barbra” and “where’s the bear” 
Pretty much just your catch phrases
3972 2018-05-08 19:11:44 Great, the threat of war just increased, we will pay big bucks for oil and gas...and what else....feel free to add
3973 2018-05-08 19:11:44 Pulling out of the Iran deal? Watch oil stock prices...
3974 2018-05-08 19:11:40 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3975 2018-05-08 19:11:40 Can someone explain to me why would oil prices go down after #Trump pulled out of the Iran deal?!  Aren't they supposed to rise?!
3976 2018-05-08 19:11:40 U.s exiting the Iran deal,I wonder the impact on oil prices
3977 2018-05-08 19:11:38 Working collaboratively with our partners, our joint efforts to rebalance the oil market and bring investment back into our industry are progressing well. Collectively, we will continue to focus on these goals.
3978 2018-05-08 19:11:37 You forgot: 

4.) Gas prices are about to go through the roof
5.) This benefits every oil person on the WH staff. 
6.) NK will NEVER trust a deal from us after this.
3979 2018-05-08 19:11:35 All the while sending oil back towards $100/bbl and staving off economic collapse. Impressive.
3980 2018-05-08 19:11:29 It is quite a miracle that the oil price is not above $150 in today's political climate. I guess we can thank renewables (apart from shale etc).
3981 2018-05-08 19:11:27 United States gets to pump more oil because of the ripping up the #irandeal and provides our country with even more money and reduced trade deficit.  Well done Sir.  #obama and # Kerry almost written off the record books.  Great day indeed.
3982 2018-05-08 19:11:25 So the want Iran's oil
3983 2018-05-08 19:11:18 #US sanctions against #Iran will include: 
- oil embargo 
- sanctions against banks
- sanctions against shipping companies and airlines
3984 2018-05-08 19:11:02 US is always at War where they can grab the oil, wealth... Unfortunately, they don't have anything as such in Afghanistan.... Bad choice to invade...
3985 2018-05-08 19:11:01 Gonna be funny when iran is pressed and decides saudi oil fields are more attractive targets than settlements. Why not zag when everyone is expects a zig?
3986 2018-05-08 19:11:00 Sure looks like today was a good ol' fashion shake out by the big boys to grab panicking oil and gas stocks this morning. What a bounce off those panic lows. 
3987 2018-05-08 19:10:59 It’s always distraction. Whenever you get into the grit of solving these complex problems it always turns personal. Big oil dumps money into politics too but young people aren’t showing up for that. We want homes!
3988 2018-05-08 19:10:58 You realize why the hostage crisis occurred? The USA deposed their democratically elected leader in 1959. So, imagine China coming into D.C. with helicopters and stealing our President. The USA did that to Iran in 1959 because Iran wanted to keep their oil money. You're dumb.
3989 2018-05-08 19:10:56 หนักละผัวกรู
3990 2018-05-08 19:10:54 WIll impact us negatively,oil prices will shoot up
3991 2018-05-08 19:10:52 Putin will be thrilled! Russia/Putin not only benefit from resulting oil price increase, but Trump signals undermining support for European Union and allies. ALL to Putin’s benefit. Trump is playing into Putin’s hand. #IranNuclearDeal
3992 2018-05-08 19:10:50 I suspect that it will lead to a spike in gas and oil prices for many.
3993 2018-05-08 19:10:50 Trump is such a tragedy to US, the world and all the good secured by Obama years in WH. 
See what he’s shot down just in over a year:
- Paris Climate Agreement
- Trans-Pacific Trade Deal
- DACA
- Obamacare 
- Low oil prices 

and just now.... #IranDeal
3994 2018-05-08 19:10:38 You got me, why does he do anything?  Maybe to drive oil prices up for Vlad and his boys?
3995 2018-05-08 19:10:33 How much you want to bet that Russian oil companies will benefit?
3996 2018-05-08 19:10:33 Oil Prices are going to rise because of this. I guess the Saudis will be happy.
We are paying almost $4 a gallon. I am filling the car up before the increase.
3997 2018-05-08 19:10:31 Your “foresight” that you posted couldn’t be further from the truth if you tried. As an example, Iran has ZERO affect on gas prices in the U.S., Saudi Arabia is the main comptroller. We do not buy oil from Iran.
3998 2018-05-08 19:10:30 The decision to remove the  from the deal will skyrocket oil prices, Iranian & Israeli forces in Siria are moving now... this is a clusterfuck.

The sad thing is you know it’s a fuckover & you lick 45’s boots...

Why? 
3999 2018-05-08 19:10:29 Lol i know gotta do an oil change on the bmw for a road trip and put studs on my Z so i can move it off the driveway for the first time in 2 years
4000 2018-05-08 19:10:28 Haha. Nobody cares. We imported Oil despite sanctions, that too at a favourable price. EU, China and India would not get along with US on this decision.
4001 2018-05-08 19:10:25 OPEC is a non-political organisation. Our goal is to ensure the stability of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry
4002 2018-05-08 19:10:22 At the lease the, this has raised tensions. It'll be interesting how this affects Japan, Korea, and China. Sanctions will hurt them based on their oil imports.
4003 2018-05-08 19:10:19 Liz you sound really stupid right now. The markets like this move. Oil going up. Dollar down. Positive for us businesses. Just what the Dr. Ordered. Maybe you should come in earlier and do full research not just get briefed.
4004 2018-05-08 19:10:18 does anyone know what this means for the price of oil?
4005 2018-05-08 19:10:16 Oil and water do not mix
4006 2018-05-08 19:10:06 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
4007 2018-05-08 19:10:05 He could always go back to putting oil company messaging on government letterhead, that seemed to be working just fine
4008 2018-05-08 19:10:03 DT thinks that after a war with Iran he can take the oil from Iran. Success with that!
4009 2018-05-08 19:10:02 For as much as the average Joe hates big oil they seem to hate agriculture even more
4010 2018-05-08 19:10:02 Wars everywhere almost never end. History of the middle east is rich, it is also a birth place for almost all abrahamic religions today. Current conflicts could have festered post oil discoveries, but the west. Bringing the kingdom of Saud to power. History is important.
4011 2018-05-08 19:10:00 Yes it is.
@realDonaldTrump wants their oil to share with Russia and others.
4012 2018-05-08 19:09:56 It’s aboutoil, natural gas. For Kerry,Biden it’s abt their sons ties to Burisma Holdings-Cypress Ukraine Co (SorosCarlyleCo) who want to expand to region

@realDonaldTrump wants to De-Nuke De-Chem Iran while expanding US natural gas exports to region helping US companies first
4013 2018-05-08 19:09:56 You go in for oil change ... and a hr later you find out they’re doing a tune up replacing all these parts without even asking you...
4014 2018-05-08 19:09:52 We all are. He puts Putin, oil and corporate above all else. I was just giving you my opinion on what he's going to do.
4015 2018-05-08 19:09:51 @MSNBC  Godfather trump said during campaign that he wanted Iran’s oil & now he’s going to end up sending our ppl to war to get It - not for us but for himself thru buddies! OUR GAS PRICES ARE GOING EVEN HIGHER! Why doesn’t media play that part from rally?
4016 2018-05-08 19:09:50 He doesn't know what the F he is doing! He's listening to warmongers with oil interests. Putin will be happy.
4017 2018-05-08 19:09:50 just jaw dropping moves in oil today wow.
4018 2018-05-08 19:09:46  well I wash my face in the morning bc if not I got enough oil to fry some chicken, but I see where you coming from king 
4019 2018-05-08 19:09:43 Lol it was embarrassing, 4 Yoruba girls against one Hausa girl,on parade ground
4020 2018-05-08 19:09:41 Oooh Calisi love to be your oil boy getting that hot inked bod ready for fun
4021 2018-05-08 19:09:39 We are yet to harness tourism in Nigeria. Each state of the federation has one or two tourist sites but unfortunately we are tied to oil money which is milked and drained by our political leaders
4022 2018-05-08 19:09:37 Dude your country is going broke. Everyone knows you are pumping water and your oil is almost gone. That’s why no exchange wants to host the Aramco IPO because they know you are lying about the reserves. Yemen has oil and you are slant drilling at the border to steal theirs....
4023 2018-05-08 19:09:37 Oil investors moving the money over to bitcoin to hedge against the impending war?
4024 2018-05-08 19:09:32 He's just doing what his boss, Putin, ordered.  Need more regional conflict to get that price of oil up so Russia can start making money again.
4025 2018-05-08 19:09:30 @LeonardFiddler you must not be a very bright fella huh? Looks like @JustinTrudeau has brainwashed you too. It is a fact that at least 40% of Canada’s economy is oil related across the nation.
4026 2018-05-08 19:09:30 There goes up the oil prices
4027 2018-05-08 19:09:27 Rebecca Jarvis: Iran is OPEC’s third largest oil producer. Sanctions will likely mean a disruption to Iranian oil, and hence to the worldwide supply of oil. Historically, less supply means higher prices.
4028 2018-05-08 19:09:27 I bet Russia starts buying all of Irans's oil and their gas prices will go way down! BASTARD #TRUMP!
4029 2018-05-08 19:09:26 And of course, the part that concerns Nigeria.. How does this affect oil prices 
4030 2018-05-08 19:09:20 @kbsalsaud With the rise in oil prices, Venezuela, Iran, China and Russia will probably form an alliance and use Renminbi oil derivatives to pay for oil, which will crush the dollar. Russia has LNG, Venezuela and Iran together all the oil, China has the new oil futures market.
4031 2018-05-08 19:09:16 BeBe and Trump are fucking crooks that want ALL the oil in the middle east. They need to be brought up on treason and war crimes charges immediately. Our fucktard president lied in front of America by saying that Iran was building nukes TODAY. Not true. Lies. #ImpeachNOW
4032 2018-05-08 19:09:14 Thank you Eddie and Heid. I accept the award with Honour and convey my sincere thanks to that plank Gerry65 for making my choice so easy today. I look forward to more of Gerry's misleading Bullshit Tomorrow :)
4033 2018-05-08 19:09:07 EK are you short again oil?
4034 2018-05-08 19:09:06 Tis the season of tanning lotion and coconut oil
4035 2018-05-08 19:09:03 #USA to exit Iran Nuclear deal...sanctions on Iran will be imposed..
Impact on India (Negative)
1) High Crude oil price likely
2) High Inflation
3) FIIs outflow
Positive Impact
1) Rice, Tea & Sugar export to rise to Iran as happened before 2015 (Sanction period)
4036 2018-05-08 19:09:03 I've seen this at the Louvre: "Sentient robot drinks water", Oil painting, 2018, artist: 01001101110
4037 2018-05-08 19:09:03 #DonaldTrump announceed USA's withdrawal from  #Iran #NuclearDeal.The decision is likely to raise the risk of conflict in the #MiddleEast, upset America's #European allies & disrupt global #Oil supplies.Iran has ruled out renegotiating the agreement and threatened to retaliate
4038 2018-05-08 19:08:59 Now the mullahs can eat their oil.
4039 2018-05-08 19:08:56 Do we see buy the rumour and sell the fact in Oil after Trumps sanctions? #brent #crude #oil @ForexLive
4040 2018-05-08 19:08:51 So, I guess the meager increase I got from the tax deal will now go to the oil companies...
4041 2018-05-08 19:08:45 I got some thc oil blessssss
4042 2018-05-08 19:08:37 Fill your gas tanks. Price of oil will go up even more.
4043 2018-05-08 19:08:37 Russia is rich in oil.. higher oil prices is good for Russia.. this is why trump pullled from the Iran deal #russiantraitor
4044 2018-05-08 19:08:37 BREAKING: UK's Theresa May just coming in w/ a statement on @realDonaldTrump exiting #IranNuclearDeal Folks, oil settled DOWN not UP. WATCH @FoxBusiness now, news coming in fast and furious
4045 2018-05-08 19:08:36 ชั่งมันเถอะเนาะ นอนเตอะอิ๊
4046 2018-05-08 19:08:35 Recklessness, fecklessness, trouble, and toil.
Sometimes cuz communists. Sometimes cuz oil.
Sometimes cuz who cares if the skies stay blue?
Or cuz we forget "they" are humans, too.
Whatever the reasons, we still seem to make
No good, very bad, foreign policy mistakes. #IranDeal
4047 2018-05-08 19:08:33 It’s all a smoke screen to sell more arms, Trump and Putin playing the Middle East like puppets. Who needs high oil prices and to sell more weapons  that’s all USA and Russia have
4048 2018-05-08 19:08:30 O/N Wrap:
Trump nukes the nukes deal with Iran - US pulling out of accord; market broadly positioned for that news ahead of time, so knee-jerks minimised; oil and equities lower, USD higher; NZD pushes further below 0.7000, hitting a new 2018 low.
4049 2018-05-08 19:08:26 The Asian continent is a neo-colonial ticking time bomb that continues to be exploited post discovery of oil in 1908. Seaway nations along Gulf to Ocean emanating at Suez canal has been exploited and manipulated . . . THAT doesn't even address Pakistan and India let alone Israel
4050 2018-05-08 19:08:24 Now what do we do with Iran. We are isolated and the value of our opinions have plumeted. The hatred of everything Obama did is going to ruin any chance that President Trump has to get anything done.

I got to put some money in oil stocks...lol
4051 2018-05-08 19:08:23 Here is a quote from Markets Section, Wall Street Journal, "Higher Oil Prices are NOT necessarily bad for the ECONOMY" said by Risk Manager but same Risk Manager said, "prices would have to reach $80-$100 to have an EFFECT"!
4052 2018-05-08 19:08:23 Joale she made it worse with the oil she has on!! 
4053 2018-05-08 19:08:22 Pen and a Phone. Remember that?
4054 2018-05-08 19:08:22 So maybe I don't have a PhD in political science, but.....Russia's economy is based on its oil industry, yes? And with Trump's cancelling the Iran agreement, this will result in increased oil prices, yes? And would not increased oil prices benefit Russia?
Am I missing something?
4055 2018-05-08 19:08:16 What? Oil prices are going to rise. So you don't care?
4056 2018-05-08 19:08:15 They want the land for cattle and oil.
4057 2018-05-08 19:08:08 Trump has really said what's been needed for ages!

Hit the Oil rich nations where they hurt the most...their money.

They value their money way above the nuclear deal ideology.

A man being used by God at present..
4058 2018-05-08 19:08:06 Jesses, is he drunk. John looks like an oil painting compared to #NewDawnCR. Looks like a wanted poster.
4059 2018-05-08 19:08:02 You sound pretty stupid to me. You clearly have no understanding of how the oil industry works or the market constraints that apply to it, yet you feel you can comment with misinformation. Hint: depletion is not an allowance, it's an expense. Same for any resource extraction co.
4060 2018-05-08 19:07:56 Will the Trump, Bolton, Pompeo, pence, and aipac sons be in uniform when the missles start flying
So when gas goes to 4 and 5 dollars a gallon who benefits? In effect it's another tax increase on the middle class .
Who benefits are the oil companies, just as planned.
4061 2018-05-08 19:07:55 Saudi oil price to increase as well if production remains the same.
4062 2018-05-08 19:07:52 Trump's Iran decision will probably put further upward pressure on oil prices as the threat of (more) conflict rises. Not what the UK needs right now.
4063 2018-05-08 19:07:47 They cant finish potatoes worth 400 use rest to buy groundnut oil n salt to taste shekinna
4064 2018-05-08 19:07:44 High oil prices (cost at the pump) is the best thing that will happen to the electric vehicles market, along with the fact that big cars have been dominating the consumer choices.

4065 2018-05-08 19:07:42 A leader who wants more war for oil.
4066 2018-05-08 19:07:42 Russian oil?
4067 2018-05-08 19:07:40 Higher oil prices, higher inflation worldwide. American US oil-industry and Putin happy. At the same time a smack to the much hated, energy-poor tradebloc EU.  What's the next step? Most likely a trade war with Europe. Divide et empera.
4068 2018-05-08 19:07:33 You think he's studied the issues. Vlad.  Get rid of sanctions. Can't do. I'll get oil prices increased. Just stay out of Iran. Vlad sure thing. Hey Vlad where is Iran getting $ and arms. Beats me.
4069 2018-05-08 19:07:32 Impeach this madman, he's going to get all of us killed. The price of oil is going to shoot up to $200 a barrel now and will completely paralyze this country. This is shear madness!!
4070 2018-05-08 19:07:31 I wore the perfect outfit to get my oil changed 
4071 2018-05-08 19:07:31 STOP!!!  THIS IS INSANE! You want a war in the Middle East? You want oil prices to skyrocket? You want us to lose all credibility in the world? You want everyone to mistrust us? You do not know what you are doing.  Stop.  Just stop.  #ResignTrump
4072 2018-05-08 19:07:30 Nothing but higher oil prices
4073 2018-05-08 19:07:30 This whole withdrawing from the Iran deal isn't gonna go down the way they think.

We are not gonna carpet bomb & take the oil. The 80's are over.

Economic Vietnam.
4074 2018-05-08 19:07:29 The day I meet some1 selling snake oil, who gives a  abt the ‘democratic legitimacy’ underpinning their marketing ploy,  I’ll die instantly
4075 2018-05-08 19:07:26 As in prognoses. Oil will go up, i think. But "local" indexesmay to go down. DJI, and another after it.
4076 2018-05-08 19:07:24 All the oil money is being used to develop nigeria while the real owners that land sleeps in abject poverty. Is there any major city in #Biafra Land developed or about to develop by the Central government?none! #oduduwa south easterners should wake because northerners are evil!
4077 2018-05-08 19:07:13 Too ripe. E don even soak for oil. 
4078 2018-05-08 19:07:06 Oil prices bout to spike, thank God I have a 4 cylinder.
4079 2018-05-08 19:07:05 Hes buying, I'm not complaining. 
4080 2018-05-08 19:07:04 Hella bummer.  Is that oil or coolant on the floor?
4081 2018-05-08 19:07:04 @maddow please tell me that this pullout of the Iran deal is not about oil???
4082 2018-05-08 19:06:44 It's George W Bush Iraq War all over again.
Trump,Bolton,Giuliani and the ISRAELIS all want War/Regime Change and Iran's 4th largest oil reserves in the world
Trump has said we win Wars but we don't keep the oil Billionaires are going to WIN. American lives will be LOST AGAIN !
4083 2018-05-08 19:06:42 The division between EU and the US on Iran Nuclear deal will spur a new development in OPEC oil price. Some countries will gains massively while some will lose.
4084 2018-05-08 19:06:40 @Honda if your going to do oil changes first come first serve, then u need to have a special center for oil changes or a department specificically for it at the dealer. I’ve waited for 2 hrs. For a oil change. Simply ridiculous.
4085 2018-05-08 19:06:35 I love how when I get stressed I don’t get stress acne I stress oil and my skin gets all oily
4086 2018-05-08 19:06:34 Wait for oil prices to tear you apart now. Trump MKL.
4087 2018-05-08 19:06:33 Who gives a shit. We can get our oil from Alaska.
4088 2018-05-08 19:06:29 It's raising oil prices.
4089 2018-05-08 19:06:29 Perhaps the current version with 51% sugar, 13.7% saturated fat and palm oil may have something to do with it. Also it use to be crisp wafers covered in Chocolate. Trouble with marketing jobs, is they have a finite life. Changing a product to improve its margin is futile.
4090 2018-05-08 19:06:28 Did you forget bp oil spill, polluted water, polluted air from gas companies, happened under Obama?
4091 2018-05-08 19:06:24 Well done David....you are on the ball !
4092 2018-05-08 19:06:20 ???? We only get 14 percent of our oil from the Middle East. The majority comes from the US, Canada and Latin America.
4093 2018-05-08 19:06:20 If we wanted the oil, we would have been better off just buying it from the terrorists, but we don't want oil, we want peace. This war in the ME has been going on for a long time and it's a constant irritation for us. You start a war, we'll finish it.
4094 2018-05-08 19:06:18 But we don't need $100 a barrel oil. All that is going to cause is what happened 3 years ago, a glut.  which caused oil prices to slump and drilling slowed down to a crawl. It was a rough 3 years for 10s of thousands of workers.
4095 2018-05-08 19:06:18 I guess next week is a good time to hedge oil. Get it on the low after the Trump's decision to back out of the Iran deal. Well that's if there's still an earth next week, things are changing fast.
4096 2018-05-08 19:06:15 Yeah i shouldn't do that again...i wanted to see if truly tomato are a bad trigger for my stomach...had a small bit with some fresh mozzarella cheese and a lil olive oil..10 minutes later got mega sick. So i have any intolerance or "allergy" to tomatoes and most products included
4097 2018-05-08 19:06:14 So Trump quit the #IranDeal. I laugh in crude oil prices 
4098 2018-05-08 19:06:14 @realDonaldTrump just wants oil prices to go up, use that as an excuse to take over National Park lands, stealing more land from Native Americans to hand them over to corporations and get his cut of the deal. #BeBest to keep the Iran deal as it is
#liarinchief #resistance #resist
4099 2018-05-08 19:06:12 Thread on Iran nuclear deal!

In 1953, the CIA engineered a coup of Iran’s democratically elected president, who planned to nationalize oil. After decades of US backed dictatorship, an anti-America theocracy rose to power in Iran.
4100 2018-05-08 19:06:07 anyone have a spot price for 5 oil?
#oott
4101 2018-05-08 19:06:04 I wish I knew why my car keeps reving....  I haven't been able to drive it...worst part is all levels are good when I check the oil and transmission fluid....I just wish someone will help me get it fix...
4102 2018-05-08 19:05:56 He has repeatedly said “Next time we go in there, we should take their oil.” With #Bolton in his ear, it’s only a matter of WHEN, not IF.
4103 2018-05-08 19:05:54 Through UN creates programmes like Food for oil(run by cos like Shell, Texaco and Aramco) to support the economy that they have destroyed.. pilferage all the oil through these programs back to US.. All this only sell their arms and increase their stores of oil. 2/2
4104 2018-05-08 19:05:53 My husband tells me turmeric oil will do the trick with midges and ticks. Might work on mozzies?
I rub tansy all over me... Just for the enjoyment of it, though.

4106 2018-05-08 19:05:52 and remember DJT said we should have kept the oil --- and Iran is the single state-owned oil nation the GOP and BIG OIL has wanted for generations....danger.
4107 2018-05-08 19:05:52 Had a chat too with this lady on her pony so took a few as she rode up through the oil seed
4108 2018-05-08 19:05:49 Does oil have to be above sixty  dollars for fracking to be profitable  ?
Some reason that figure sticks in my head
4109 2018-05-08 19:05:46 Do you realize what oil prices are going to do now?
4110 2018-05-08 19:05:36 $TSLA Higher Oil $USO Higher goes $TSLA!
4111 2018-05-08 19:05:33 Israel wants war--and so does Trump, who wants the oil.
4112 2018-05-08 19:05:29 Funniest comment award from Eddie and Heid goes to Adrian

4114 2018-05-08 19:05:17 Wars make them Money, hence why he wants to start one Oil Barons are desperate to get into Iran for the oil.
4115 2018-05-08 19:05:17 They don’t have the technical knowledge to put a nuke in a suitcase, if they could buy one, russia would be the one selling it. Maybe we should bomb russia then? Read up on Iran, they’ve had US made fighters since the Sha, and they had 100Bn in seized capital from oil exports.
4116 2018-05-08 19:05:13 Okay so Plans on the agenda for today: 
-Change my car oil 
-Pay my car 
-Wash my car 
Yea and this girl doing it by herself nobody spoil her baby like I do
4117 2018-05-08 19:05:08 Ending Iran Nuclear Deal will help Russia and big oil bc it will raise gas prices. It will hurt Americans. #IranNuclearDeal
4118 2018-05-08 19:04:58 You can't understand cuz you dont have the data he had access to. in iran most people hate this regime most people dont want islam and are not okey with what revolutionary guards and their proxies doing with their money. 
he cut the regime incomes of oil export at the best time.
4119 2018-05-08 19:04:52 Where do you get yours from? I can never find pure vitamin E oil! 
4120 2018-05-08 19:04:48 Oh great. The price of oil just went up which will benefit some of your friends. And we the taxpayers foot the bill again with higher gas prices. Please resign or drop dead ASAP

4122 2018-05-08 19:04:47 The house of saud, the number one terrorists in the world and supporters of destabilizing the entire region because your dictator regime won’t survive once the demand for oil falls 
4123 2018-05-08 19:04:47 I predicted Donald Ducks  pull out of nuclear deal " lSRAEL and Saudis " have Trump and the Neo-cons in their pockets " Oil and " now watch Macron and May jump ship  but Russia and the remaining players will stay in deal check mate 
4124 2018-05-08 19:04:44 Putin and the Koch brothers own massive oil interests. Driving up the price of oil by say, pulling America out of the Iran Deal, benefits their wallets. It also, however, drives up gas prices for Joe #Maga and insures his little Magats will die fighting in another Mid-East War.

4126 2018-05-08 19:04:44 My own view is that the US (and Canada and UK) should produce lots of gas/oil of their own and get out of mid-east politics/pipelines/arms deals/wars altogether.
4127 2018-05-08 19:04:40 And it drives up oil prices, which helps guess who?  RUSSIA

4132 2018-05-08 19:04:29 Trump violating Iran deal benefits Putin:
Higher oil prices AND will give Russia more control of mid east oil. Russia will supply them with nukes & ICBMs (just like they do w/ North Korea) & control a Persian Gulf naval base to interfere with oil shipments, further raising prices
4133 2018-05-08 19:04:29 I like to use castor oil soap with essential oils. I have also found a plant based cleaner that I really trust and smells amazing! If you want more information on it let me know!  :)
4134 2018-05-08 19:04:27 It was only after @IKEAUK had left that I found oil all over my brand new staircarpet, landing and bedroom. Despite many many phone calls e-mails, tears, anger! Still nothing has been done.
4135 2018-05-08 19:04:25 it will never cease to amaze me how little thought Americans give to the  lives our foreign policy choices have destroyed. The damage we cause rarely directly impacts us beyond how much we pay for oil but our shitty geopolitical choices affect people on a global scale.

4140 2018-05-08 19:04:19 Departure from Iran Deal Good For GM Lordstown. Higher gas prices push new car buyers away from lower MPG SUV and Truck purchases which could push gas to $4.00 plus once again as oil from Iran comes off world markets. The Saudi And Russia Markets Still have room to increase

1. Russia: US$23.7 billion (14.6% of China’s total crude oil imports)
2. Saudi Arabia: $20.5 billion (12.6%)
3. Angola: $19.8 billion (12.2%)
4. Iraq: $13.8 billion (8.5%)
5. Oman: $12.2 billion (7.5%)
6. Iran: $11.9 billion (7.3%)
4149 2018-05-08 19:03:56 um no he didnt. not even figuratively. it was Iran's money, even though the concept of rightful ownership may be strange to you. like Iran's oil belonging also to Iran. and Iran has as much WMD plans as Iraq did. how many times can you fall for this?

4153 2018-05-08 19:03:36 Thanks for sharing! So far I bought camphor oil so we’ll see how that goes.
4154 2018-05-08 19:03:32 Looking at it selfishly, the cons of the deal do not offset the hit my pocket book is going to take due to the increase cost of oil.
4155 2018-05-08 19:03:32 Nah, we only have two more years of regressive policy.

Electric vehicles won’t be stopped, and that will be the end of the oil cartels....after that who cares what the Middle East does.
4156 2018-05-08 19:03:27 still waiting for contract to get cleared by big oil
4157 2018-05-08 19:03:26 Iran is now free to kick out inspectors and work on developing nuclear weapons.  This is really about Iran changing from trading oil in Dollars to trading oil for Euros.  This is about the Petro-Dollar.
4158 2018-05-08 19:03:22 Big winner in all of this?  Has to be Russia.  Their economy rises & falls mostly on oil prices.  Uncertainty in the ME = higher oil prices.    Putin just needed an econ. win and got it.  Also big win for US oil.  Big loser, US consumers.  There go some of the tax plan crumbs.
4159 2018-05-08 19:03:21 Now Oil prices are probably gonna hike & that’s bad.
4160 2018-05-08 19:03:20 @MCaruso_Cabrera even though you love the news this Iran deal has nothing to do with stocks maybe oil that’s it. Everyone needs to remember that. Zero implications for equities. We don’t do business with them barely. Buy on the dip
4161 2018-05-08 19:03:18 finna oil my scalp & throw this durag on.
4162 2018-05-08 19:03:18 It'll raise oil prices. Russian economy is oil dependant.  Better prices for Putin means more buildings for Donny too launder money through.
4163 2018-05-08 19:03:17 Waaaaiiiit #Iran has oil nowww?

USA being USA under any fucken party, any fucken leader.
4164 2018-05-08 19:03:16 Inzwai zvenyu VP pihwai anointing oil from Prophet you will be healed
4165 2018-05-08 19:03:15 Make oil go down the Saudi don't need 80$ they can settle on 68-72$. Will they fill the Iran void? Will they snatch up higher supply possibilities and capitalize with out exploiting American at the gas pump??
4166 2018-05-08 19:03:11 it’s just my vitamin e oil tbh lmfaoooo imma fraud 
4167 2018-05-08 19:03:10 #Crude #oil breaches $70 as markets await #Trump call on Iran sanction
4168 2018-05-08 19:03:10 With the #usa pulling out of the #IranDeal , The American people lose, supply and demand economics will increase the price of gas, and the big oil will win. Less supply of oil means, higher price. The only Americans that win are in the oil industry.
4169 2018-05-08 19:03:09 Oil prices will go through the roof! Russia is a major exporter of oil, this news will make Putin very happy!
4170 2018-05-08 19:03:06 I was blessed today by the hospital's Chaplain and he put a really good essential oil on my hand and I can't stop smelling it. 
4171 2018-05-08 19:03:04 It will not last - spiking interest rates, soaring oil prices, $21 trillion record breaking debt on which interest exceeds the Defense Budget - stock market,  job creation and wages stagnating. 18 months to recession.

4173 2018-05-08 19:03:02 Maybe the idea is to piss Iran off enough that SA gets convinced the only way to secure oil exports is to assimilate Yemen & gain the port of Aden.

英文：Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!
4175 2018-05-08 19:02:56 So if i have most of the world's energy producing resource, (oil) and i decide to use another energy producing resource, (nuclear) then i could sell my oil at 100% profit  
Real reason they backed out of the #Iran deal?. Oil & Money woth a tad of jealousy smfh
4176 2018-05-08 19:02:52 #Oil is set to boil as Trump said he'll begin reinstating sanctions on #Iran.The potential for renewed sanctions drove crude at the highest level since 2014. Sanction will stop Iranian Oil supply to the markets & may push prices towards $80 a barrel in the short term #IranDeal
4177 2018-05-08 19:02:51 Breaking: In a final blow to Naseebwala PM Jumla (my luck brought Crude Oil Prices down -but never consumer prices) Trump pulls US out of Iran Deal, is set to reimpose Sanctions!  Brace up for skyrocketing of prices and a big jolt to economy already hit by Note Ban & Bank Loot.
4178 2018-05-08 19:02:40 But the price of oil is over all pegged to the USD. Unless Iran wants to sell it for less?
4179 2018-05-08 19:02:39 What an embarrassing day,4 girls fighting over u against one,as if ur dating them  haduwar camp,rabuwar camp
4180 2018-05-08 19:02:38 I have to get another dang on oil change 
4181 2018-05-08 19:02:37 Today this idiotic Racist moron withdrew from the IRAN deal further isolated the U.S & oil prices are going soar& first he withdrew from the Paris agreement all on account of envyJealousy of President Obama & he's trying to erase everything Obama did !
4182 2018-05-08 19:02:32 Iran cease trading oil in dollars, USA invades. How unexpected.
4183 2018-05-08 19:02:27 America has "never" taken oil all we have ask for is land to bury our hero's. Let that sink in asshole. @WayneLogan12
4184 2018-05-08 19:02:25 What if it was all an act to raise the price of oil? That's something that Vladimir would certainly approve of.
4185 2018-05-08 19:02:24 Yep. And now sit back and watch the economy fall apart. High gas/oil prices, higher cost of food, job growth is down. Soon unemployment will be up. Sounds like 2008 again.
4186 2018-05-08 19:02:21 20/04/17 Obama bizi kandırdı

- DACA
- Obamacare 
- Low oil prices 

and today: Iran deal
4187 2018-05-08 19:02:21 How does fighting wars for Saudi Arabia do that?  I say invade them and take the oil
4188 2018-05-08 19:02:21 Based on WTI fluctuations today, it is clear the oil pros do not have a clue
4189 2018-05-08 19:02:19 The first thing I did when I got to work today was splash 350 degree oil on my face and arms. Fuck yes.
4190 2018-05-08 19:02:18 also Russian needs oil prices to go up
4191 2018-05-08 19:02:13 Higher $$$ oil is good for renewable solar & wind technologies. Good for reducing miles driven. #SilverLining
4192 2018-05-08 19:02:11 Beginning of the end for the US era. China and Russia will now trade oil in various currencies..Turkey will pull out of Nato.. and in 20 years , Americans will wonder why the US dollar is a second B- currency.
4193 2018-05-08 19:02:10 President Traitor continues to do pee-tape puppet master Putin's bidding, dividing us from our allies and driving up the price of oil to make Putin and the Saudis richer. I hope his supporters enjoy their increased gas prices!
4194 2018-05-08 19:02:10 This lady sitting next to me while I get my oil changed won’t stop smacking her lips or gums I can’t tell and it’s driving me crazy.
4195 2018-05-08 19:02:06 RT oilpriceupdates "Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 75.73 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent"
4196 2018-05-08 19:02:03 I'm just wondering as to how long will Trump wait before he starts claiming that Iran has weapons of mass destruction? After all, Oil is so much more important than world peace.
4197 2018-05-08 19:02:01 #Saudi got to love this #oil price spike. In reality besides commodity prices the only thing that has changed is explicit hatred being directed towards #Iran whereas it was slightly veiled before. Most of the world could not be bothered with US' sanctions. #US making itself rogue
4198 2018-05-08 19:01:54 You might want to fill up the car tonight. Just saying #WTI #Oil
4199 2018-05-08 19:01:52 One of those things, I didn't jump for joy over Trump's backing out of the Iran deal, but it wasn't a deal to begin with. Democrats and establishment republicans sold it like snake oil.
4200 2018-05-08 19:01:40 America is a horrible country! They will make any excuse for war. But what the elites want is control of Iranian oil & their central bank.
4201 2018-05-08 19:01:39 GOP strategist Mike Murphy says "Iran deal was imperfect but by unilaterally ditching it we abandon US leadership yet again. EU and China will buy oil, so pain to Iran will be minimal. We gain nothing and increase PRC’s geopolitical strength."
4202 2018-05-08 19:01:38 The fact that your big oil donors will benefit from massive oil futures has nothing to do with your support of the President on this painfully reckless move, I’m sure. You’re every bit as transparent as @GOP leadership, Governor.
4203 2018-05-08 19:01:37 Let me know what you think. Am always looking to cut out palm oil.
4204 2018-05-08 19:01:36 Oil starts to climb in 3... 2... 1... Biggest oil play since Bush/Cheney. Good times ahead!
4205 2018-05-08 19:01:35 I don’t know what to believe, but my gut says it comes down to controlling oil prices.
4206 2018-05-08 19:01:32 But it raises oil prices, such as for Russian oil (should someone have an interest in doing such a thing...).
4207 2018-05-08 19:01:32 It's all about raising oil prices to help Russia. #TrumpRussia #IranDeal
4208 2018-05-08 19:01:31 After Trump's decision today, why would North Korea ever agree to an agreement with the US? Frankly, why would any of our allies agree to any new agreements with US? You know benefits today? Russians and KSA. Oil prices are going up.

4215 2018-05-08 19:01:17 What sanctions, they will put sanctions on us. Back during Obama Iranians had money in our banks which we froze to encourage them to negotiate. Now the $ was returned to them as they agree to agree w/negotiations. Now they have nothing in the USA but we still need their oil. LOL
4216 2018-05-08 19:01:13 Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 75.73 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent
4217 2018-05-08 19:01:11 Not the most important issue. Trump denounces 7-nation Iran nuclear accord, insulting allies & vastly increasing danger of MiddleEast war-Move is sure to raise oil & gasoline prices negating Don’s much-hyped America First to please Netanyahu & MBS-US drivers get shafted-No MAGA!
4218 2018-05-08 19:01:04 Renewing sanctions would make it much harder for Iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system.
4219 2018-05-08 19:01:02 Since the US imports no oil from Iran we should be ok dropping an accord that one side wasn't adhering to anyway.
4220 2018-05-08 19:00:59 I think everybody's missing a good point here Donald Trump said in the Iraq War seize the oil fields and keep the oil I wonder if he's thinking the same thing about Iran
4221 2018-05-08 19:00:57 is it true higher oil prices help Russia?  I mean if so, that would be too funny (hollow laugh followed by deep sigh kind of funny)
4222 2018-05-08 19:00:53 Cue in increase in the price of oil & instantly higher prices at the pumps. I despair.

4234 2018-05-08 19:00:37 yes!! Amazon has good ones. I'm obsessed. Put it in the oil diffuser and it's EVERYWHERE
4235 2018-05-08 19:00:35 @GOP has been selling weapons for oil going on 50yrs. The $$ made funding ‘military weapons’ and wars in exchange for oil is their only way of staying in power. GOP benefits from oil prices increase. They can sell more weapons to the middle east again.
4236 2018-05-08 19:00:34 From an energy trading desk: "This could give a boost to Chinese oil exchange.  If sanctions are re-imposed you can bypass US banking system by trading in Yuan for oil & settling offshore Yuan for gold.  Iran/India/China may be interested in exploiting this opportunity."

4242 2018-05-08 19:00:17 One option is to move away from the US$ as the global oil currency. Another is to defy US sanctions and see if US retaliates. 

But Iran’s internal politics will matter, too: this strengthens hardliners vs Rouhani, and hardliners want to get the nuke prog back up and running.

4257 2018-05-08 18:59:46 If @realDonaldTrump follows through on "highest level of economic sanctions" talk, foreign companies will have to decide whether they want access to Iranian oil or US capital markets.

4259 2018-05-08 18:59:23 Mr Trump - we know this is about the price of oil and your Saudi friend's.... Withdraw from deal, impose sanctions and OPEC can raise the price due to reduced supply !  Nothing what so ever to do with a Nuclear threat...

It is a crying shame !

4263 2018-05-08 18:59:08 raising oil prices is also a big win for Putin/Russia
4264 2018-05-08 18:59:03 They require plenty of oil. And I will admit that an eggplant done properly is still a texture some can never enjoy (perhaps you are one of them). Thinly slice them, dust with flour or cornstarch, shallow fry them until golden, drain, salt and drizzle with honey - HEAVEN.
4265 2018-05-08 18:59:02 DT got played by Benny Netanyahu  and the Saudi's.  Both have an interest in Saudi Aramco ipo.  I think oil goes higher.

4271 2018-05-08 18:58:45 With the middle East destabilized, deals were made behind closed doors to make American oil company's money
4272 2018-05-08 18:58:44 Iran now has the US' blessing to go ahead to create nuclear weapons. I can almost guarantee 45's Iran sanctions will decrease the world supply of oil.Gas prices go up even more. 
So much for winning.
4273 2018-05-08 18:58:44 No we just sell them weapons for oil...
4274 2018-05-08 18:58:42 US purposely interferes in the working of countries of Middle East by creating unrest by supplying arms to religious fanatics, then sells arms to defend the country from terrorists, then destroys their oil wells under the garb of protecting them. 1/2
4275 2018-05-08 18:58:40 I’m not defending it.  Stating Oil missed or discounted it.  Which is irrelevant to premise that 1 yr ELC space is a godsend that can be spun into high quality for that one final ELC season.
4276 2018-05-08 18:58:40 And the remaining countries will try to make up for the differences except for oil, which is going to cause gas prices to soar in the US and Canada.
4277 2018-05-08 18:58:40 This is only lose-lose for US corn farmers.  RINS will have no value, allows Big Oil to blend less ethanol.  In the real world, we all know Big Oil only blends ethanol when forced by mandate or huge price differential.
4278 2018-05-08 18:58:39 Can I take my vote back and say oil?
4279 2018-05-08 18:58:38 Yep, and there is a big difference between crayolas and oil. #MAGA
4280 2018-05-08 18:58:33 Low oil prices I thought that had to do with US fracking and OPEC
4281 2018-05-08 18:58:28 Follow the oil profiteers, especially Putin.
4282 2018-05-08 18:58:27 Pulling out of the Iran deal pushes up oil prices, which must make Trump friends like Koch and Hamm very happy.
4283 2018-05-08 18:58:25 It may take a few months to get sanctions back in place, but from this I can see further support for oil prices. Consumers might want to "brace" that is, if Trump's just bluffing.. #oilprices
4284 2018-05-08 18:58:18 It's in part why we caused a drop in global oil prices - further cripple Russia.

4288 2018-05-08 18:58:10 Rosneft (Putin) will rake in higher profits when oil prices go up as a result of Trump pulling out of the #IranDeal.

It also empowers hardliners in Iran and pushes that country even closer to Russia while further reducing US influence on the world stage (another Putin desire).

4290 2018-05-08 18:58:03 Let them know oil exist on Mars
4291 2018-05-08 18:58:02 Same old story. War and oil.
4292 2018-05-08 18:58:00 There goes are oil/gas prices and all goods & services. Inflation's a comin. trump is cutting us off from all our allies. He'll soon be isolating the U.S. from the free world, except for the Authoritarian Dictators. Do you see what's coming? I do. @JohnBrennan @SenateDems
4293 2018-05-08 18:58:00 Interesting! I did some p/way work down there in the mid- 90s and all I saw were oil trains! Nasty part of town, the kids used to throw rocks off bridges.
4294 2018-05-08 18:57:59 But they aren’t the bad guys because the US sells them weapons to steal oil from Yemen.
4295 2018-05-08 18:57:59 The price is manipulated by the west.
 And heavily hedged regardless of where price is...

Why not take thier oil reserves at a cheap rate in a flooded market?
4296 2018-05-08 18:57:57 Russia wants higher oil prices and a fractured Western alliance. They are getting their wish. Their wish is your command? I know you are unwitting, just a plaything for his allies to manipulate.
4297 2018-05-08 18:57:57 So glad that Oil prices will go up :-)))) we could be at risk of nuclear attack :-)))) risk of conflict has gone up too :-))))) we basically are on risk of destroying our own economic system and the US as a whole by being a**holes and not wanting involvement in other countries +
4298 2018-05-08 18:57:50 Achhe din for a few in Oil extraction industry have come and India pays for the corporate wealth creation.
4299 2018-05-08 18:57:48 Is fish oil healthy? Or is it just a prank all dads play on their families?
4300 2018-05-08 18:57:47 You're a damn fool. Not only will instability in the Middle East become worse, you will raise the prices of gas and oil. You're a racist who's jealous of Obama's success.
4301 2018-05-08 18:57:47 Trump is wagging war so as American can make money, war is a big business after drugs and oil + gold + iron combined. Americans got greedy I see 
4302 2018-05-08 18:57:44 Sanctions reimposed on Iran. Iran likely to act disorderly again. Israel will ask for help to deal with Iranian threat. Tensions. Oil prices rise. R20 a litre easy.
4303 2018-05-08 18:57:43 Steve, why would Iran need nuclear energy when it is sitting on so much oil?
4304 2018-05-08 18:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4305 2018-05-08 18:57:34 Them forrins put garlic in it. And sometimes *whisper it* olive oil. That stuff is for unblocking your ears.
4306 2018-05-08 18:57:34 Because Israel and Iran are going to war. Israel wants US assistance. They intend to make Iran kneel. Russia gets increased oil prices, Iran gets obliterated.
4307 2018-05-08 18:57:33 Snake oil salesmen Obama tried to convinced the world "Islam was the religion of peace." Europe bought it. Now Sweden, Germany,& the UK are experiencing that peace in the form of rape,murder, & the supplanting your culture for there's. That's Islamic Peace. That's Islam.
4308 2018-05-08 18:57:30 Killed #Iran deal stopping them from developing nuclear weapons for 10 years!
What a WIN for #America!
Likely to cause Iran to develop nukes, makes Middle East war more likely, already making oil & gas prices SOAR!
Why? Makes me look TOUGH & distracts from #MuellerInvestigation!
4309 2018-05-08 18:57:30 Agriculture is our both federal government and state next target apart from crude oil to eradicate unemployment in Nigeria...this is one of the agric product that you can farming or buy and resell to big company.
4310 2018-05-08 18:57:29 Woow! #Trump anuncia que retira a #EEUU del tratado de irán y restablecerá las sanciones,,,, Vix +3% Oil -2% SP500 sólo -0.3%
4311 2018-05-08 18:57:24 One good economic impact of Obama sanctions on Iran was a drop in the global price of oil as Saudi Arabia and others stepped up production. Now days after we hear that the Saudis are trying to RAISE the price of oil we have POTUS threatening sanctions. Will oil respond?
4312 2018-05-08 18:57:20 I’ve been paying 80+ for oil changes and i go to the dealer today and it’s only 40 
4313 2018-05-08 18:57:17 we are less safe today.  Iran will likely develop nuke weapons as will Saudi Arabia — and the 70-year effort to stop nuclear proliferation is over. Then there’s spiking oil prices. We have also surrendered U.S. leverage in the Middle East.
4314 2018-05-08 18:57:16 I put this cocoa butter oil on & I’m shiny as hell  everything I touch gets glossy  my phone slipping out my hands & shit 
4315 2018-05-08 18:57:15 1.Term limits 
2. Spread gov out across the country. Dismantle the central nerve center. 
3. Bust the Unions
3 things would go a long way
4316 2018-05-08 18:57:14 No oil price is going down. Don't buy.
4317 2018-05-08 18:57:03 HE DID DEAL WITH IRAN. He stopped their nuclear weapons program AND reduced the oil price...Now you're content with Middle East policy driven by Saudi Arabia
4318 2018-05-08 18:57:02 I had to google Eileen from Corrie, and Porky was right she’s no oil painting
4319 2018-05-08 18:57:00 China could cause some real damage to the price of oil

4324 2018-05-08 18:56:45 $USO the oil market is in full effect!
4325 2018-05-08 18:56:37 Why y’all didn’t tell me it’s A LOT cheaper to get an oil change at the dealership vs the other places  I’ve wasted so much money ....
4326 2018-05-08 18:56:36 5% of Iran’s crude oil exports too...
4327 2018-05-08 18:56:32 US pulling out of Iran nuclear deal will have an affect on oil prices.. of course we'll see cpc blaming PMJT for the rising gas prices
4328 2018-05-08 18:56:31 Iran didn't pull out. If they did we could easily sanction any nation who didn't help us bring them under US oversight. But, since the US pulled out, nations may stay with Iran for the oil. Then when we sanction them (our allies), we Will be just short of declaring war,on allies.
4329 2018-05-08 18:56:26 BREAKING NEWS: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says he has ordered foreign minister to negotiate with other countries in nuclear deal.

IN RELATED NEWS: GAS TO GO UP UNLESS WE GET RUSSIAN OIL LOL
4330 2018-05-08 18:56:24 #Trump has killed the #Iran deal plunging world into another form of darkness. #Gold reversed from down to up (but only a little). #Oil surprisingly off while #stockmarkets steady. Positive for #gold.
4331 2018-05-08 18:56:21 I’m sure Putin approves of all the turmoil and spiking oil costs - it’s but a small price to pay to get a few hotels in Moscow with “Trump” plastered across them
4332 2018-05-08 18:56:19 Yea? Well, he did tax cuts, pulled out of the TPP, Iran Deal, Paris CA, stock markets up, oil prices up (good for me), illegal immigration down, Black unemployment down, manufacturing jobs up, Supreme Court justice — yea the “resistance is doing good lmfao.

4336 2018-05-08 18:56:07 listen, put jojoba oil & avocado oil in the hair dye. Mix it. When you’re done deep conditioner with a treatment to moisturize & color hair. Maui moisture has a hair mask for color hair. You will be good. Trust me. I dye my hair often & my hair is good
4337 2018-05-08 18:56:05 Creating a 90-180 lag time on #IranSanctions opens door to negotiation...

 one reason why oil is down
 also #sanctions expected

Korea peace moving fwd matters a lot more now than Iran (esp since Saudis and Israel support sanctions)
4338 2018-05-08 18:56:05 USA doesn't need Iran's oil.  Europe does.
4339 2018-05-08 18:56:05 & don't forget, I don't know, Russia? Will benefit from the enevitible bump in oil prices. Why don't the other signatures just ignore the US & refuse to implement any sanctions?
4340 2018-05-08 18:56:02 It's good for the US to lose foreign contracts? Withdrawing from step one to a permament peace is good? So now with sanctions back on Iran can't sell oil to the USA, ( or anywhere) they can't buy foreign goods (from anyone) and you think they'll feel safe and happy?
4341 2018-05-08 18:55:57 Just remember when listening to all this handwringing about our European allies. The EU just wants to sell Iran stuff and buy their oil.
4342 2018-05-08 18:55:55 Russia want oil price to go up and Netanyahu wants us to bomb Iran. @GOP just wants to piss of liberals.
4343 2018-05-08 18:55:51 @narendramodi being a very common person like many others, I don't understand why petroleum products prices are hiking only in India while i'national crude oil prices are stable and steady? Are we adding any saffron technology to it??
4344 2018-05-08 18:55:51 I guess oil prices are going to skyrocket, & Wall Street is going to start shaking right about now. #IranDeal
4345 2018-05-08 18:55:49 I don’t understand why is oil red today
4346 2018-05-08 18:55:46 An Ailing man that wants to recontest another 4-yr term in office as the "chief benefactor" of Nigeria's oil money.
There is nothing MIXED not to talk of it REACTING.
4347 2018-05-08 18:55:45 He does not care about Middle East only cares about business deals and himself ag
price of oil will hit the roof and instability can Middle East have a bteak really
4348 2018-05-08 18:55:39 Gas would be pretty cheap if oil was $4 per barrel 
4349 2018-05-08 18:55:36 I'd like to thank the President for the highest oil prices since 2014.  Well done sir; now for increases in health insurance. Some deal.
4350 2018-05-08 18:55:28 #veganhour no one needs to eat bacon butties, just quickly fry some @Tofurky Hickory Smoked Deli Slices (I use a smidge coconut oil) & whack it on a roll/barmcake/bap where ever you are from. It's amazing!!!!!
4351 2018-05-08 18:55:17 Oil prices are going up. Selling more to international militaries. Follow the money.
4352 2018-05-08 18:55:13 Guess who benefits from the rising oil prices this is gonna cause? If you guessed Russia, you’re right.
4353 2018-05-08 18:55:13 Now oil prices will go up Iran will pretty much go back to their nuclear weapon program, & the middle east i don't even want to imagine.
4354 2018-05-08 18:55:08 Russia exports oil! Putin must very happy today!
4355 2018-05-08 18:55:08 A big thank you from the Oil stocks sir!
4356 2018-05-08 18:55:06 The President just aligned the USA with Saudi Arabia and Israel and against the UK, Germany, and France.

Looks like we’re going oil hunting boys.
4357 2018-05-08 18:55:06 I freakin love camphor oil its such a good smell
4358 2018-05-08 18:55:03 Unless it's nuclear and we're all wiped off the face of the Earth, I'd say oil as war machines run on oil...
4359 2018-05-08 18:55:01 You can already sell your oil in Houston. Oh but we can get a higher price in Asi with TMX. GREED.
4360 2018-05-08 18:54:55 Oil has hardly rebounded  It had been trading near decade lows for almost all of the last 2 years.  The recovery has nothing to do with the price of oil.  You forget just 3 years ago, oil was trading routinely at $90-100 a barrel.
4361 2018-05-08 18:54:55 The man is an ass.  And, riding oil prices is s boon to Putin and Russia. This is why he is doing it!
4362 2018-05-08 18:54:54 My son in Calgary almost lost all his lillies a couple of years ago but he was ruthless and did defeat them. Constant vigilance dawn and dusk . He used neem oil as well. Good luck in your battle

4365 2018-05-08 18:54:50 Oh they absolutely do.

General Wesley Clark admitted that was in the plans back in early 2002.

Nothing to do with “terrorism” (or else we’d stop supporting Israel & Saudi)

Has everything to do with maintaining the #PetroDollar Standard.

Iran wanted to trade in Gold for oil.
4366 2018-05-08 18:54:49 So, the energy lobbying industry, promoting oh, say, oil drilling in the gulf of mexico, is not evil?
4367 2018-05-08 18:54:44 Su inflazione anni 70 la pensiamo diversamente, per me la politica monetaria e fiscale hanno avuto ruolo cruciale. Oil shock ha colpito anche Germania ma inflazione è stata molto diversa
4368 2018-05-08 18:54:43 The so called experts & insiders ALWAYS say that exponential disruption is impossible Then wave after wave of innovation happens Just recently Mercedes stated the Tesla Semi was impossible all while customers are verifying its real world performance Old Auto-Big Oil are doomed
4369 2018-05-08 18:54:24 Yep, then him & Putin go in and take all the oil. They are the fourth largest reserve in the world...... #IranOilGrab
4370 2018-05-08 18:54:24 Trump did it he has screwed all that want peace in the middle east it quite apparent that he wsnts to own the middle east because who controls the oil will control the world..also Iran and Iraq were the beginning of civilization and this area will be the end of civilization

4373 2018-05-08 18:54:17 The U.S. is now a rogue nation, distrusted by everyone, whether ally or enemy.  Putin is winning in every possible way, including higher oil prices.
4374 2018-05-08 18:54:15 @RepLeeZeldin Listening to your spin to justify Trump's irresponsible decision to withdraw from Iran deal sickens me.  He further divides us from our allies; increases probability of Iran getting nukes & risk of war & assures increasing gas and oil prices.

4379 2018-05-08 18:54:05 Then again oil is probably reaching the peak so...
4380 2018-05-08 18:54:05 Then US will threaten sanctions...Anyways we are now importing US oil

@realDonaldTrump will Never make a Nuclear Deal with Iran.

Trump will make Nuclear Deal with Natanyahoo not Iran.
4386 2018-05-08 18:53:51 we will import Russian oil next, it’s been the plan all along
4387 2018-05-08 18:53:47 Time to start budgeting for gas and oil again.
Fuck you #trump
4388 2018-05-08 18:53:46 I gently await the price of oil, if the price of oil shoot up. Will it affect our FX?
4389 2018-05-08 18:53:46 Yeah because it will allow them to charge more for oil since this will take a supplier out of the occasion and reduce competition.
4390 2018-05-08 18:53:45 Trump only wants it gone to raise the price of oil.  He is filling the swamp
4391 2018-05-08 18:53:42 Twatty Trump McTrumpface. Following his ‘TV’ announcement for WW3, and oh yes helping the oil barons.
4392 2018-05-08 18:53:40 I'm sure they do support our reneging on the JCPOA, given the decrease in Saudi oil revenue...
4393 2018-05-08 18:53:37 If they can trade with the EU, the US means nothing. We don’t import anywhere near as much oil as before, most is domestic and obtained from fracking.
4394 2018-05-08 18:53:36 I’ll be surprised if he succeeds at bringing back a unified sanctions regime. I’d guess Iranian oil will continue to flow.
4395 2018-05-08 18:53:27 Are u actually bragging about Trump weakening relationships w Europe helping Russia w high oil prices and America and our allies literally gaining nothing? WTF is wrong w you?
4396 2018-05-08 18:53:27 Iran has the 4th largest oil reserves in the world. 
They have a population 1/4 the size of the US. 
They get our money through oil sales and have their energy supply with oil. 
This was a no brainer.
4397 2018-05-08 18:53:23 .@davidgregory You have a job that supports the family. 100 miles away. No bus or train. And a crappy car. Motor runs rough. Burn gas and oil like crazy. Bad paint job. Do you fix your car, work to get a new one, or just dump it and walk to work?

4398 2018-05-08 18:53:23 So all the touchy, feelly, kissey, hugging, with Macron was for show. Same with everyone else. Trump actually thinks he can go in and get their oil. Remember during the debates and campaigning, that was his intention. IDIOT.

4403 2018-05-08 18:53:04 @realDonaldTrump is really out here risking peace in the Middle East for rising oil prices and the possibility to sell more weapons #IranDeal
4404 2018-05-08 18:53:02 pulling out of the iran deal does make sense for his oil buddies (both saudi and north american), anything to stop that cheap iraninan oil
it won't hurt him either if he can sell a few guns
4405 2018-05-08 18:53:02 I know that, Iran will never be diplomatic + its a #EU deal, but i look at it from the Russian perspective,  will really hurt Russian weaponry and nuclear energy sales, but curious of consumer of oil prices in the US.

4420 2018-05-08 18:52:33 This only benefits Russia you know. Iran will go to them to sell their oil and America will be shut it. But you’re a Russian so you should be happy about it.
4421 2018-05-08 18:52:30 If you don’t think this decision impacts you as an American, get ready to pay $5 to $7 a gallon for gas. They supply a lot of oil that we turn into fuel.  This best case senecio.

4424 2018-05-08 18:52:08 Except the Oil Sands
4425 2018-05-08 18:52:02 we r going to import russian oil next...
4426 2018-05-08 18:51:58 Oil prices still hovering around 70.00.  I expected a bigger swing after Iran pullout was announced.
4427 2018-05-08 18:51:56 By the way, you do know the price of oil will rise now and hurt poor and middle America - right? Of course you don't care because Russia will reap the profits. Why is Russia behind every door and around every corner whenever Daddy does something?
4428 2018-05-08 18:51:55 it’s to help the oil companies and put in.
4429 2018-05-08 18:51:55 Got to love it!!  It’s too bad that we aren’t self sufficient in our oil consumption - we just keep sponsoring terrorism with our oil purchases.
4430 2018-05-08 18:51:53 Trump withdrawal from the the Iran nuclear deal is a big favour for Saudi Arabia (which wants to keep Iran's oil off the market) and Israel (which has illegal nuclear warheads) - and nothing to do with the interests of the USA.
4431 2018-05-08 18:51:49 Congratulations to President Donald Trump. Iran has long been funding Syrian and Palestinian regimes with its oil. Iran has betrayed and betrayed its own people with a dictatorial regime and no opportunity for its people.
4432 2018-05-08 18:51:47 I finally have a Tuesday off after like two months and got an oil change. my dad has the nerve to tell me I should change my own oil for my car to save money.

WITH WHAT TIME?! 

If I had all the time in the damn world maybe, but not if I got stuff to do and placed to be at.
4433 2018-05-08 18:51:46 GAS PRICES WILL BE HIKED UP SO FILL YOUR TANKS, CAN OR BARRELS.  WE DO NOT RECEIVE OIL FROM SYRIA BUT AS U KNOW GAS COMPANIES WILL TAKE EVERY ADVANTAGE THEY CAN TO RAISE GAS PRICES.

FILL UP NOW !
4434 2018-05-08 18:51:46 It is priced in , Oil went up in the last few weeks on presumption that the deal will fail
4435 2018-05-08 18:51:45 He pushed the Iranians and their oil toward the Russian sphere of influence. Putin picked well, for himself.
4436 2018-05-08 18:51:43 Money. Oil prices rising. Power Lies told to make America Afraid again.

4438 2018-05-08 18:51:41 Just another reason for the NY oil speculators to raise the price. It has nothing to do with supply and demand. #pricefixing
4439 2018-05-08 18:51:38 Just poured white wine into the frying pan instead of oil.

It's been a long day, folks....
4440 2018-05-08 18:51:35 Congratulations to President Donald Trump. Iran has long been funding Syrian and Palestinian regimes with its oil. Iran has betrayed and betrayed its own people with a dictatorial regime and no opportunity for its people.
4441 2018-05-08 18:51:35 The Golan Heights is about oil. Israel sold the rights to the oil there to Genie Energy.
4442 2018-05-08 18:51:18 《オリーブ油豆知識》

4443 2018-05-08 18:51:18 Tightening face masks, reiki naps, rosehip oil serum. How I self care on a Wednesday.
4444 2018-05-08 18:51:17 So we're out of the Iran deal,
No Iranian oil for us
No oil from Venezuela bc they're a mess
Where will we get oil? I know, how about Russia?
Watch those gas prices
4445 2018-05-08 18:51:12 Of course, Trumpster breaks the Iran deal. It's all about the following:

1) Getting back at Obama.
2) The End Times.
3) Greater Israel.
4) Oil pipeline access to the Middle East.
5) Covering his ass from impeachment with endless war.

#ThanksHillary
4446 2018-05-08 18:51:05 I'd buy a Citra-infused Oil of Olbas.
4447 2018-05-08 18:51:03 @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP 
Now will you out check and balances on this DOTARD OF A PRESIDENT? If not...you will go down with him! Gas and oil prices are going to soar now so won't everything else...tgis will hurt @realDonaldTrump base more than anyone else...THIS IS THE END 4 HIM
4448 2018-05-08 18:50:54 to give you an idea, my oil payment scenarios are more detailed than some of my simulation scenarios in my dissertation and ive definitely spent an equivalent time on it now
4449 2018-05-08 18:50:53 So Iran has a GDP about the size of New York State but its mostly oil, so if you put a squeeze on the oil ... Who really gives a crap?
4450 2018-05-08 18:50:52 Here comes $100 oil barrels! Good job super Mr smart businessman!
4451 2018-05-08 18:50:49 use coconut oil on them (and get a pedicure), but seriously it is the best for feet.
4452 2018-05-08 18:50:47 Congratulations to President Donald Trump. Iran has long been funding Syrian and Palestinian regimes with its oil. Iran has betrayed and betrayed its own people with a dictatorial regime and no opportunity for its people.
4453 2018-05-08 18:50:39 I'm only concerned about the Crude Oil Price
4454 2018-05-08 18:50:38 Shell oil company
4455 2018-05-08 18:50:37 I dont trust any oil companies. They was subsidized production with depletion allowances for profitable companies. How stupid are we. I could not care less if Canada has an oil industry or not.
4456 2018-05-08 18:50:36 Of course the President didn't mention the fact that oil prices per barrel will go up a lot since Iran is a large part of OPAC which sets the prices on oil, even US oil. Which means higher gas prices at the pumps. Est approx over $4 per gal for the consumer.
4457 2018-05-08 18:50:35 #IranNuclearDeal US decides to withdraw from the deal. Imme. fallout: high oil prices why US wants it ?? #whitewednesdays are on rise in #iran and this'll be followed by a series of sanctions. US hoping to bring down  Ayatollah's rule by Iranians resentment.
4458 2018-05-08 18:50:33 Haha cheaper oil in Iran or Canada, it ain't just the oil.
4459 2018-05-08 18:50:31 $XOIL Oil sanctions begin November 4, 2018. #Iran faces other restrictions on Aug. 6th. $XLE $OIH see pr link
4460 2018-05-08 18:50:24 somebody call me in an hour and remind me to get an oil change
4461 2018-05-08 18:50:19 Bolton says companies that do business in Iran  (like French oil giant Total) could face US sanction in six months time.
4462 2018-05-08 18:50:16 Change the oil!! What do you think he's a mechanic or something? How about something reasonable like...fill the wiper fluid (be prepared to have your engine explode when he's done)
4463 2018-05-08 18:50:15 But it got the price of oil up, that's what matters, especially to Putin.
4464 2018-05-08 18:50:15 Only good (in relative terms) effect of the demise of the Iran nuclear deal for Nigeria will be the temporary spike in oil prices.

But that is beside the point.
4465 2018-05-08 18:50:02 The fuel oil price rising is prob reason #1. Putin and the oligarchs can't afford to lose the billions they've got in oil futures.
4466 2018-05-08 18:50:02 Now that Trump has pulled out, IF the P4+1 stay on, I think Iran will only consolidate further across Syria, Lebanon, Iraq. Also, they just opened a new oil field; they may find folks happy to do non $ denominated trade

4468 2018-05-08 18:49:50 How does that work if the rest of world doesn’t join in? Higher oil prices in the US? Oh wait you don’t buy from Venezuela and now not Iran. Jeepers that’s gonna hurt!!
4469 2018-05-08 18:49:49 After 1 1/2 commercial meeting, I have to take something is easily digestible, this is my new dish - Kale salad mixed with mini sweet pepper, dressing with olive oil, apple cider vinegar, chia seed, black pepper and salt. Taste good!
4470 2018-05-08 18:49:49 Read your own article - this is a slap on the wrist - not STRONG sanctions.  Where are the sanctions against oil?
"The Trump admin is unleashing additional sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs w/ties to President Vladimir Putin along with 12 companies they own or control."
4471 2018-05-08 18:49:48 45 and Iran..lets review..Syria has oil and gas..Iran has oil and gas..Saudi's want their oil and gas..Putin wants their oil and gas..Give Iran an excuse to be stupid..BOOM the war is on..Putie fills pockets..Saudi's fill pockets..its not about Nukes..its' about oil
4472 2018-05-08 18:49:47 I pioneered the double sweatsuit technique on the other cat which jumped onto an oil pan and needed to be aggressively de oiled.

She was under a deck trying to clean her own fur we didn't want her ingesting oil
4473 2018-05-08 18:49:43 Always felt the exchange of money (which, of course, was the return of frozen assets, a fact Trump ignored) is what really infuriated him. After repeating that we should have taken Iraq's oil, he clearly thinks the resources of non-Europeans is ours to take.
4474 2018-05-08 18:49:37 Iran deal also about oil. This will raise the price of oil for his friends in the US oil industry.
4475 2018-05-08 18:49:33 @KatyTurNBC 
we r going to war with Iran and he’s going to attempt to import Russian Oil
4476 2018-05-08 18:49:32 Your funny.  Both sides are guilty but each one only thinks the other is. 
Your statement is most common. 
Why we will eventually implode
4477 2018-05-08 18:49:24 That said, I definitely want the price to drop faster, and it should, especially with what is possible with battery reclamation. The main challenge is whether or not enough companies can find enough profit to go for it. Big oil $ will be attractive for a long time, I'm sure.
4478 2018-05-08 18:49:22 They are not humans! They don't have conscience, they want to ruin everyone. That's the only way they can be happy! First ibeto, then capital oil, Innoson...now emzor! Funny thing is, theyve support from south west, same people emzor helped in generating revenue and taxes! Hate!
4479 2018-05-08 18:49:22 Wonder would Jamie Oliver feel the same if he was intolerant to artificial sweetners? Also from watching his 15/30 minute meals would he be so involved if there was added tax on butter, oil etc. (Suppose he's not worried about money - just growing his brand)
4480 2018-05-08 18:49:21 Are you stupid? We have reneged on a deal and left our allies hanging. Iran can now begin testing again and if any nation tries to follow the original deal it violates US sanctions.

Putin is humping a pillow with excitement.
Oil is going up.
4481 2018-05-08 18:49:19 We are not energy independent. As Iran's ability to sell into the world oil market is curtailed, supply will fall and prices will go up. Increased domestic production may curtail some of the price increase, but gas was already $3.09/gal near Chicago this weekend.
4482 2018-05-08 18:49:15 Rouhani:

"Iranian people should not have FEAR"
"We have a nuclear agreement WITHOUT AMERICA"

4483 2018-05-08 18:49:14 Blza, mas da maneira como você colocou, parece que somente após ele decidir é que o Oil explodiu. 

Sei que isso atrai mais clicks, massss...Fabio Alves nunca foi fake news. hehe

Grande abraço.
4484 2018-05-08 18:49:14 I wonder how much Putin will make off increased oil prices.
4485 2018-05-08 18:49:12 What the hell does the USA have? Iran has a large reserve of oil waiting to be exported.
4486 2018-05-08 18:49:11 Oil prices set to rise
4487 2018-05-08 18:49:11 Also causes huge loss to European Oil Cos, American Aviation Cos who had struck deals with Iran as with sanctions now in place it wud be difficult to deal with Iran after its blocked out financially.

4491 2018-05-08 18:48:56 All the Nigerian looters are from the northern part of nigeria that's why they can fund all the #evil going on against #Biafrans and they threatened to kill if anybody touches Bayelsa oil(#Biafraland ).that's madness. @#BiafraReferendum!
4492 2018-05-08 18:48:53 Pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal cuts the funds off to the Globalist in the Middle East. Now they will funnel money through the oil futures market and jacking up oil prices. Two problems, China backed oil contracts. And.... Petrocoin. Here we go! #shitjustgotreal
4493 2018-05-08 18:48:50 All you have is hearsay. You can show me hard numbers by 45 and I'll show you the same by 44. Job growth is down with 45. Those tax cuts are bogus. We know bc we're middle class. Gas/oil prices are up. Yeah 45 is doing SO much. 
4494 2018-05-08 18:48:48 Nobody is more annoying than the guys that work at oil change places I swear
4495 2018-05-08 18:48:42 Plenty of oil in the US and plenty of capacity in Saudi Arabia to make up any lost from Iran
4496 2018-05-08 18:48:31 I’ll pay a little more for oil if it means getting out of that #IranDeal
4497 2018-05-08 18:48:29 I stopped to smell every lilac tree on my walk to the nail salon  I need to find a lilac scented perfume.  Maybe just lilac essential oil?

4499 2018-05-08 18:48:28 @realDonaldTrump Let me get this straight. Iran agreed not to develop nuclear weapons. We agreed to do business with them. Now you're lighting fire to the parchment so the world will have more nuclear weapons? How is oil going to solve this one? #PeeBrain #FakeLyingPresident
4500 2018-05-08 18:48:20 How do you explain to your mechanic that you're 10,000 miles over due for an oil change....... Asking for a friend
4501 2018-05-08 18:48:18 you know the answer to that. oil.
4502 2018-05-08 18:48:16 #Trump #lies. Believing him is #naive and a mistake. #Oil companies benefit as well #defense companies More #money donations to #Trump Our president is #corrupt. He wants focus off #Mueller . This is one way to do it. Again #Trump is a
4503 2018-05-08 18:48:16 Iran was producing around 3.3M barrels of oil a day in the last round of Sanctions
4504 2018-05-08 18:48:15 @DanaPerino certainly hope @POTUS #Trump has a plan to put 800 thousand barrels of #Oil in the market to keep #gas prices reasonable
4505 2018-05-08 18:48:11 Still working like that covered with oil or fat ?
4506 2018-05-08 18:48:11 Oil as bulk.
4507 2018-05-08 18:48:11 #IranDeal, oil prices, etc. But also real Persian people will also continue to suffer as their economy tanks because of this. Persian people, also known as people, got a BIT of help from the nuclear deal. But its gone now. So if yall wanted starving brown people, ya got it.
4508 2018-05-08 18:48:09 Standard payoff playbook. That and selling oil reserves in ground
4509 2018-05-08 18:48:07 to all my savannah ppl, DO NOT GO GET YOUR OIL CHANGED AT THE JIFFY LUBE RIGHT BESIDE COOKOUT ON ABERCORN ST. most of the oil leaked out my car because they forgot to put the washer back in place!
4510 2018-05-08 18:48:02 Getting my oil changed and they came and said “did you realize you have a major oil leak cause there’s oil everywhere under the hood” and my dumbass had to explain i left the cap off the last time I put oil in my car 
4511 2018-05-08 18:47:59 @POTUS Mr President,  you have to control the price of oil.  The commodities exchange can do that.  Talk to them.  They commodity investors will accept a fair profit.
4512 2018-05-08 18:47:59 Higher oil prices so Master Vladdy can make more cash.
4513 2018-05-08 18:47:57 He’s thinking that Russia will get more oil sales...
4514 2018-05-08 18:47:56 Trump: Iran NoDeal  = Oil prices should 
4515 2018-05-08 18:47:55 Yes lets just destroy an international deal that keep Iran from attaining nuclear weaponry for the vain reason that Trump and his associates hate Barack Obama. He just effectively threw a match to a gasoline soaked hay stack next to an oil field.
4516 2018-05-08 18:47:51 Giving how addictive rising oil prices have been for the Nigerian economy (its citizens, really), shouldn’t we be proscribing oil companies?
4517 2018-05-08 18:47:50 We will be brining the Shah of Iran back from the dead and will be returning the Peacock Throne to it's rightful owner...the oil companies
4518 2018-05-08 18:47:49 *Mineral oil* not spirits lol got work on my mind
4519 2018-05-08 18:47:47 Are we going to lay out terms to which we can agree? Are we just waiting for the Iranian prime Minister to come gravelling at Trump's feet? Our allies are pissed. North Korea probably won't trust us to make a deal. The sanctions raise our oil prices and hinder our own businesses
4520 2018-05-08 18:47:45 Ahhh love the insta world reaction... let’s wait and see what  a new deal looks like... my biggest concern is what will happen with OPEC & oil prices here in Ca we are getting killed. 
Hopefully this isn’t a precursor to Iran US rising tensions... leading to a big issue
4521 2018-05-08 18:47:44 Rouhani:

"Iranian FM will negotiate wth Europe, Russia, China"

=> the deal against the deal

#Oil $SPY $SPX $DAX #EURUSD #IranDeal
4522 2018-05-08 18:47:44 Actually the motivation is much more simple than that. They want Iran's oil off the global market, which will drive the prices up even more for 's oil buddies here and in Saudi Arabia.
4523 2018-05-08 18:47:43 Face scrub (2-3x a week) and then a regular facial cleanser, tea tree oil or witch hazel, moisturizer for your skin type, DON’T touch your face so often throughout the day, switch/ wash pillow case once a week, wash your face atleast once a day.
4524 2018-05-08 18:47:43 I want Arsene to take over at PSG. I want to see what he will achieve in Europe with oil money.
4525 2018-05-08 18:47:42 "Iran threatens U.S. & says it will block oil route around "Straight of the Whore Moose"! (lol that's an example why NDN's like me don't regularly report the news).

4527 2018-05-08 18:47:39 These are some VERY corrupt ppl, I don't trust them ANY more than I do Iran.
My answer - well for a VERY long time  - but extremely determinedly since 9/11, is to completely remove need for ME oil from US life!
Trying to prevent nuclear proliferation is then our only ME priority!
4528 2018-05-08 18:47:37 Yes, WAR with Iran is the goal... well, the money made in the stock market by going to war is their true goal. This is why Republicans go to war.... PROFIT. They already bought the stocks they know will increase... like oil. Bastards.
4529 2018-05-08 18:47:37 Iran technology funded by Russian arms wampum too. Will our Russian enabled Pres use Russian sanctions? Now Europe must buy Russian oil in this deal.
South Africa w Israeli funds (odd bedfellows) was providing cheap planned obsolete nuclear technology (slows Iran).

4531 2018-05-08 18:47:36 I’ve always suspected this was mostly based on oil
4532 2018-05-08 18:47:35 Gas prices are down silly. Due to America producing more oil. Iran used money to develop bombs and  financially support terrorism.

4534 2018-05-08 18:47:32 Well, what a surprise - oil prices up since Trump's announcement on Iran.
So it was nothing to do with nuclear, but all to do with oil. Yet again.
4535 2018-05-08 18:47:32 Looks like oil prices are gonna spike now. 
4536 2018-05-08 18:47:31 My daughter’s #eczema is really bad throughout the yr  her pediatrician is prescribing her a topical oil that sounds really promisingI hope insurance will cover because it’s over $100 and it’s something she really needs  I’ve tried all kinds of lotions, ointments, etc.
4537 2018-05-08 18:47:27 I was not the one who started it....although I won't "let it go" until people realize the snake oil it is.  I will always speak out on drugs.  Prescription drugs are over used too.  Everyone is always searching for the magic pill, magic week, the quick answer to problems.
4538 2018-05-08 18:47:27 man wtf is our relationship with Iran? is it really just fucked because we need oil? iranian people are cool
4539 2018-05-08 18:47:24 Who was the @CNBC analyst that said we'd never see $100.00 barrel of oil again? #ReclaimYourTime
4540 2018-05-08 18:47:21 DT thinks that he can go to war with Iran and take the oil.
4541 2018-05-08 18:47:19 That's clever lol but I think it's least likely thing to happen. Pulls outta Iran deal, more sanctions, oil prices go up, punish Iran for supporting Syrian govt., make gains in Syria, renegotiate to original deal to ensure Iran won't get nukes. Saudi/Israel happy.
4542 2018-05-08 18:47:18 Pulled out of the Iran deal. So now those of you who drive, the price per gallon will go even higher cuz Iran now will cut production of oil.
4543 2018-05-08 18:47:18 So watching MSNBC and senile Andrea Mitchell is on spouting "facts". Iran is the third largest oil producer. Not even close old lady.
4544 2018-05-08 18:47:18 I’ve been putting castor oil on my brows to help them grow and right now I started stress pulling them and sooo many came out 
4545 2018-05-08 18:47:15 Oil light, calling 999, and card part of fraudently activity ... other than that a bloody marvellous day
4546 2018-05-08 18:47:14 I know some people are going to say that this is going to cause oil and gas prices to rise but you know what we can't allow what's going on in Iran to continue they promise promise to annihilate Israel we can't stand by and do nothing
4547 2018-05-08 18:47:11 @jimcramer $THO is down 8% today on heavy volume. What’s going on?
Oil prices scaring the RV buyers?
4548 2018-05-08 18:47:09 Iran can always sell it's oil to China in exchange for dollars that China has plenty of from US trade and loans.
 
Who will Iran use as a third party country for imports of goods and to invest it's money out of reach of US sanctions?
 
Russia.

4549 2018-05-08 18:47:09 If I was Iran I would have secretly made a tactical nuclear arsenal (small barium based nuke) , just to keep the savage oil junkies from attacking you
4550 2018-05-08 18:47:07 and all but ignorant trump base rejoices for the chance to get our country back and stop the destruction REpublican's always do before we end up in Mid East at War with Iran so trump get's his oil and American kids get dead destroyed over there or back her some more by Rethugs.
4551 2018-05-08 18:47:07 So watching MSNBC and senile Andrea Mitchell is on spouting "facts". Iran is the third largest oil producer. Not even close old lady.
4552 2018-05-08 18:47:02 There are two reasons I can see why Trump would lie about Iran and force potential war.  1. Prices of Oil and 2. Existing deal was negotiated by the Obama administration.

4554 2018-05-08 18:47:00 If  you mean militarily , would be crazy since US  govt already 21 TRILLION in debt.  think this is words for fall election.  Of course oil sanctiions will FAIL. China will buy oil (as do now)
4555 2018-05-08 18:46:56 Almost 100% whether R or D. That’s why they won’t allow term limits. Spend most of their time working to be re-elected.
4556 2018-05-08 18:46:54 Screw you. We can already hear the war drums beating. Democrat or Republican, American kids are going to have to pay The price for a narcissistic presidents arrogance. Big win for the oil companies, though; you’ve earned your paycheck from the Koch brothers.
4557 2018-05-08 18:46:54 Trump withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. See what oil does right now. So far, it's paring its losses from earlier...
4558 2018-05-08 18:46:50 Its only oil bought by western nations that have lifted some Arab countries out ot the 12th Century, though their thinking and ideology has not changed
4559 2018-05-08 18:46:50 My dad just filled my tank up, got my oil changed, and adjustment done I’m lit 
4560 2018-05-08 18:46:48 @realDonaldTrump Since the Media is going crazy and already Speculating on Oil an Gas Prices can you lock in Fuel Prices so Americans will not suffer due to Obama’s Failed Deal?! #CheapGas
4561 2018-05-08 18:46:42 Says one snake oil salesman to another.
4562 2018-05-08 18:46:39 no settlement on oil yet
4563 2018-05-08 18:46:38 @realDonaldTrump just turn the world toward the Euro instead of the US Dollar... For Oil Industry Standard  and Europe as Leader of Free World
4564 2018-05-08 18:46:32 Would b an interesting thread to second guess the memes that will be used to propagandise + con the public into deciding that Iran is the root of all evil and must be hastily destroyed. Except for their oil supplies. I reckon the old ‘mad mullahs’ will be dusted down #Iranwheeze

4572 2018-05-08 18:46:12 Yes! Also remember Tide Water Oil yet to do 11000!
4573 2018-05-08 18:46:10 Gotta love @realDonaldTrump bangs on about high oil price then decided to pull out of Iran deal wtf does he expects to happen to oil price now, clearly everyone has forgotten his shale oil pals so obviously they want a high oil price people always thinks he's honest what a joke
4574 2018-05-08 18:46:09 Get rid of your entire phone bro
4575 2018-05-08 18:46:04 don't forget Netanyahu in all this throw a little Saudi oil and we will have a fire
4576 2018-05-08 18:46:02 We're back to neoconservative policy in the Middle East again like we were under G.W. Bush.  As long as Israel and Netanyahu set the US agenda for the Middle East we will never have the promised #AmericaFirst policy! This escalates things again w/ economic consequences on oil.
4577 2018-05-08 18:46:01 Oil as in gas or no
4578 2018-05-08 18:45:59 Wailers will start complaining about the amount it will gulp... Even when their Hero (@GEJonathan) government earned billions of dollars from Nigerias' major source of income (oil) and did nothing..
4579 2018-05-08 18:45:55 Drill baby, drill! (Snake oil is strong with this one.) Of all the costs that have gone up, medical, (now gas), could you folks do a break down of whether those $10 to $30/month raises are still legit? Or have we evened out now?

4582 2018-05-08 18:45:43 Trumps move today was totally about lining the pockets of big oil companies. Watch oil and gas prices.  Every political move he makes is designed to shift the markets to favor himself or his buddies.
4583 2018-05-08 18:45:42 How damn long does it take to get an oil change son ... I been here like a hour 
4584 2018-05-08 18:45:42 Remember though it’s absolutely nothing to do with trying to drive up the price of oil
4585 2018-05-08 18:45:42 All a ploy to raise the oil price; even this morning word that he wouldn’t back out gave cover for shorts it’s a scam s fucking scam
4586 2018-05-08 18:45:42 Iran is our next target in the resource wars. Currency choices and oil mostly.
4587 2018-05-08 18:45:41 No there were not. But you repeat it enough it becomes true.
4588 2018-05-08 18:45:41 Now Americans push Saudi Arabia to fight with Iran, Oil prices will be on hike, more uncertainty in ME, in the name of peace the Americans are promoting hatred and terrorism, they are leading the world to more proxies, more wars,
4589 2018-05-08 18:45:39 @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr how will you look your constituents in the face asking for votes in midterms when you cant even stand up to trump AMERICANS WILL PAY HIGH GAS PRICES WE WILL NOT BENIFIT FROM #iranPullOut but trump will you will if you own oil stocks #VoteBlue2018
4590 2018-05-08 18:45:37 Wall Street has alreadyshorted oil prices earlier this wk. So wealthy investors are ready to take advantage.

It'll be the average American that will get hurt in their wallets.

Trump will then try to get Saudi Arabia to help. Saudi Arabia will have to weigh the cost of helping.

4597 2018-05-08 18:45:17 I don’t think China is going along with Trump. China and India are the biggest consumers of Iranian Oil. Trump pulled out our sanction teeth when he pissed China off. I think the price won’t go up as much as you might think. India may be most vulnerable to sanctions.

4605 2018-05-08 18:44:57 IRAN third largest oil producer in the world; rest assured gas prices will go up here in US because of what Trump just did by pulling out of Iran nuclear deal and reinstating strongest sanction on Iran. Trumpsters  hope you enjoy being gouged at gas pump. @wsmv @Tennessean @NC5
4606 2018-05-08 18:44:55 common sense tip from a colleague at @CeresNews ..
BYOB. Bring your own bag! Each year the US uses 30 billion plastic bags requiring approximately 12 million barrels of oil. Each high quality reusable bag has the potential to eliminate approx. 1,000 plastic bags over its lifetime
4607 2018-05-08 18:44:54 $XOIL There is a PDF on that Treasury page that says OIL sanctions are part of the 180 day wind-down (delay) sanctions. $XLE $OIH

4609 2018-05-08 18:44:52 IMO, Alberta can't risk our fragile recovery on suddenly shifting to the UCP's austerity.  Given the strength of the recovery even though oil hasn't improved that much from it's lows, it's madness to pull the rug out now by laying off hundreds and slashing services.
4610 2018-05-08 18:44:51 It gets worse. The only viable invasion route into Iran is through southern Iraq. Iraq is not keen on 500K American troops in it's borders.

Donald "Take the oil" Trump is teeing up the invasion of two oil rich nations at once.
4611 2018-05-08 18:44:51 Deals for pending UFA don’t happen until trade deadline, which was Oil plan but irrelevant at that point.
4612 2018-05-08 18:44:51 What deal was it really we can surprise you with a visit to inspect what your doing meanwhile you can sell your massive stockpile of oil create billions for your economy to help build more missiles while telling the world death to America and Israel will be wiped out

4627 2018-05-08 18:44:13 So what you're saying is they have oil?
4628 2018-05-08 18:44:10 And to continue to repay Russia for its help by raising oil prices.
4629 2018-05-08 18:44:08 what did djt say about iraq? we should have kept the oil...is he going to try again?...this is getting scarier by the day....we ALL know that his driving purpose in life is to be as rich, or richer, than anyone else...

4656 2018-05-08 18:43:05 So we buy oil from Iran?

4660 2018-05-08 18:42:58 Saudi Arabia are the worlds biggest sponsor of terror, but they price oil in the dollar.
4661 2018-05-08 18:42:54 Get ready for Oil prices to skyrocket in the U.S.
4662 2018-05-08 18:42:52 Was already priced into the market. Also won't matter much since its just the US and Israel and oil is a global commodity. Crude oil futures are down ~2.5% on the news.
4663 2018-05-08 18:42:49 Iran isn’t even near the top for oil exports to US...Saudi Arabia is top in the Middle East and we are on good terms with them and probably more now that he got rid of this horrible “deal”
4664 2018-05-08 18:42:46 It also will raise oil prices, which benefits Russia.
4665 2018-05-08 18:42:45 me: we backed out of the Iran deal

my uncle: good, did you know Obama paid them off with cash stuffed in oil drums?

Fuck you, @FoxNews, you vampires.

4669 2018-05-08 18:42:39 one thing i ALWAYS check in my car is oil, like some of y’all really drive around with no oil and wonder why your car breaks down 
4670 2018-05-08 18:42:35 and May will join in to make a few more profits for the Arms Dealers, it is all about MONEY and OIL>.. can.t let USA and Israel take all the oil.
4671 2018-05-08 18:42:33 Yes it does actually, when more oil is exported by this country.
4672 2018-05-08 18:42:24 The deal was the only thing preventing a full scale nuclear ramp up. Also now oil prices are going to rise.
4673 2018-05-08 18:42:23 I made some coconut oil,olive oil and some honey.
The honey is unbelievably goood
4674 2018-05-08 18:42:21 It's back to #sanctions on #Iran and all who dare to do business with that republic. Are we likely to see a hike in #oil prices in Kenya and its neighbourhood? #Iran
4675 2018-05-08 18:42:17 So oil has dropped a whole lot and the spike in higher gas is now happening in the US #Iran
4676 2018-05-08 18:42:13 Some good points from Jacques Rousseau of Clearview Energy on Iran exports:

"If you take a look at what’s going on now, Iran ships about 2.2 million barrels per day to Asia. And that oil is unlikely to get changed at all. "

#OOTT #Iran #Irandeal #OPEC
4677 2018-05-08 18:42:12 Let’s see: Bring back Iran sanctions and take their oil off the market = Saudi’s Happy = US Producers Happy.  Not sure I can figure out the old mastermind on this one......
4678 2018-05-08 18:42:09 And with Bolton in place because @seanhannity wanted it we can assume we will push Iran around and possibly start a war...
How long before Iran starts screwing around with the oil that moves through 
The Strait of Hormuz ...
Did Trump offer his alternative plan?
4679 2018-05-08 18:42:09 It seems like he used Israel's "evidence" that was re-cycled from the early 2000s in his speech. My guess is that it's just a show. There should be a new deal in the summer. This bill shit could keep going though because now the peddlers can use it. Meanwhile, oil is oversupplied
4680 2018-05-08 18:42:06 Trump's target is to create a civil war in Iran like they did in Iraq and Syria and Lıbya to control Middle East and Oil and gas productions and to be sure the rate for trading of them will be USD
4681 2018-05-08 18:42:04 @trish_regan Was gas prices much higher before the bad Iran deal. How do you justify a bad Iran deal because of oil prices?
4682 2018-05-08 18:41:57 #we better all go fill up everything with gas you can after @realDonaldTrump just killed the Iran deal. Oil prices just went up. Stock market is going to climb we should have bought stock in oil yesterday. #$5.00 per gallon coming soon. Thanks trump.
4683 2018-05-08 18:41:56 We are doomed. The world is choking on plastic and our president is trying to drill all over for oil. Looking like he's going to get his way. The ignorance of the American people will be the downfall. But I will continue to fight the good fight and try to educate the people!
4684 2018-05-08 18:41:55 And oil will go up, making Putin happy so he doesn't spanky spank Dotard, the slurring moron.
4685 2018-05-08 18:41:54 Ahhh I can’t wait to be on South Beach next week rubbin tannin oil on my wife’s booty
4686 2018-05-08 18:41:53 Putin needs the price of oil to go up BIGLY to Make Russia Great Again. 

Comrade Trump is happy to do his part.
4687 2018-05-08 18:41:53 This is a naïve stab. Tensions in the Mideast rise. Oil prices go up. Putin benefits. Wars in the region expand. Flood of refugees puts right-ward pressure on European governments.
4688 2018-05-08 18:41:51 Didn't a glut of oil on the market cause the price to drop and hurt Putin's cash flow? Or am I remembering some alternate reality?
4689 2018-05-08 18:41:51 It's about driving up the price of Crude Oil to benefit Russian interests. He did this on orders from his man-crush.
4690 2018-05-08 18:41:47 Look for NKorea and Iran to be best buddies and trade on oil for nuclear materials
4691 2018-05-08 18:41:46 What if the European erhm 'partners' do not want to block Iran's oil sales via its central bank!?
"Under the most likely scenario, Trump would allow sanctions on Iran’s central bank — intended to target oil exports — to kick back in, rather than waiving them once again on Sat..

4695 2018-05-08 18:41:28 The problem with that (besides the problems for us internally) is that George Bush's rich oil friends are in direct competition with Mr. Putin for the distribution of this oil. Trump is trying to serve two masters and that always ends badly.
4696 2018-05-08 18:41:22 expect oil prices to jump and you know who also benefits from high oil prices right? yeahhhhhhhhhhh Russia
4697 2018-05-08 18:41:21 what you going to do with any of that?  it also depends where the fighting is.  gold and oil price will spike.  that will not be what i invest in though
4698 2018-05-08 18:41:18 seems like oil mattered more for EDs than the news itself

4700 2018-05-08 18:41:15 Pulling out of the Iran deal and slapping on sanctions is a MASSIVE handout to the Saudis; it stops Iranian oil reducing the price they can charge for their oil.
4701 2018-05-08 18:41:09 That guac is the best guac i have ever made, i took three cloves of garlic, minced it fine, then put it into a mortar and pestle with some seasoned olive oil, mashed it almost to a paste, then added that, salt, pepper, cumin and some rotel diced tomatoes (chipotle flavor) to it.

4703 2018-05-08 18:40:47 Things from the under-ground should stay under ground. Uranium, Oil, Natural Gas, and others. The under ground things don't belong with the people. 
4704 2018-05-08 18:40:45 Just to add the only reason he is scrapping the deal is at the behest of the Saudi's who do not want Iranian oil on the market and weakening the price (they are not in opec) ! Jack all to do with Nukes just money .....
4705 2018-05-08 18:40:34 Cut the avo in half, remove the pit, cut the ends off like you are making a thick slice. Olive oil medium high skillet maybe a few minutes then flip it. Put a egg in the center and it cools
4706 2018-05-08 18:40:31 And higher oil prices

4712 2018-05-08 18:40:20 I don’t understand Israel and America strategy when it comes to Iran ! Why pulling out of the deal instead of renegotiating?! They want to invade Iran?! Increase oil prices ?!
4713 2018-05-08 18:40:20 This should be good news for Nigeria, crude oil price to rise
4714 2018-05-08 18:40:20 Like I said, I am not for re-imposing sanctions. But more from an economic view than a geopolitical view. My issue with your tweet is that oil prices going up is all-bad for America, and it's not.
4715 2018-05-08 18:40:17 BBC: Trump signs a memorandum to immediately begin re-imposing sanctions targeting Iran's economy. 
what implications for oil prices?
4716 2018-05-08 18:40:16 Genius foods include extra virgin olive oil, avocados, blueberries, dark chocolate, eggs, grass-fed beef, dark leafy greens, broccoli, wild salmon, and almonds.

4728 2018-05-08 18:39:45 Let's not forget that Iran has the fourth largest crude oil reserves in the world and claims nearly one-fifth of the planet’s natural gas. Trump's new sanctions on Iranian oil exports will put a dent in global supply and cause prices to spike even higher than the $75 a barrel
4729 2018-05-08 18:39:45 It will further raise the prices of crude oil.

4745 2018-05-08 18:38:59 Just wait till Trump's pulling out from under the Iran Deal proves to tangentially jack up the price of oil - and our gas prices - vis a vis Mid East stability.  IT'S ALREADY GOING UP.
4746 2018-05-08 18:38:58 Iran deal cancellation will affect oil price in India?

4754 2018-05-08 18:38:38 So that wasn’t exactly making any kind of deal by Trump was it...now watch how Iran raises their oil prices with the countries that they trade with.
4755 2018-05-08 18:38:34 Well, and Vlad wants higher oil prices.

4758 2018-05-08 18:38:31 It will be interesting to watch if @realDonaldTrump sanctions European Allies if they continue to buy oil from Iran. If so, I bet they start buying their other items from other countries than the US. 

That means less exports and less income for the people here! #ImpeachTrump
4759 2018-05-08 18:38:29 I know the left all think the #IranDeal was so great bc other ppl said it was. If you read it thoroughly you r thankful for @POTUS today.

4764 2018-05-08 18:38:01 Doesn't it drive up the price of oil which will make Russia happy.. With oil so low I think I read somewhere it was costing Putin's economy billions...

4777 2018-05-08 18:37:41 Oil. Iran and Russia want Syrian oil. And who started it? America, after WW2. History shows Syria was on track for a democracy. US wanted the oil. Sent in newly formed CIA to destabilize region. And the prez was a Repub then also.
4778 2018-05-08 18:37:38 Well, I think most people can take the wild guess of much higher oil prices.  US credibility is decreased, and it will be much harder in the future to bring Europe to the table to discuss world issues (even though we tend to think they're on our side).
4779 2018-05-08 18:37:34 Look at the short term effects. Oil prices will skyrocket. Auto manufacturers who were looking towards cheap prices to sell gas guzzlers with loosened EPA regs are now facing a hesistant customer base. The economy will nosedive on this. Dems will take office as a reaction to it.
4780 2018-05-08 18:37:32 Russia is entirely reliant on its oil industry.

4789 2018-05-08 18:37:15 The new reality is the United States v. the World. To put pressure on Iran, e.g. to prohibit oil sales, the U.S. would have to sanction its own allies' firms. This fantasy from Trump supporters that a "bigger and better" deal is on the way is hot air. Only a fool would think so.
4790 2018-05-08 18:37:15 Obama Globalists will no doubt go crazy. They believe the #IranDeal brought security to America but all it really brought was the illusion of Iran giving up its Nuclear Ambitions. The Iran Regime is pursuing THE BOMB at all costs. Why buy their oil to further its cause? #Sanction
4791 2018-05-08 18:37:13 US pulling out of Iran deal is bullish for oil prices. But in the short term, this move may be bearish for Oil as Iran can be expected  to start dumping crude before the sanctions take effect. Will buy $DWT (1/3) if it drops to 7.77 again

4798 2018-05-08 18:36:45 Sounds like the made up facts for Iraq.  Trump wants to make Israel happy plus Trump wants to undo everything that Obama did because he is jealous of him.

4801 2018-05-08 18:36:43 Is the goal to undo everything Obama did and pushing oil prices up to benefit Russia only the side benefit, or vice versa?
4802 2018-05-08 18:36:42 Anyone have an essential oil question that you'd like to have answered during this Thursday's class?
4803 2018-05-08 18:36:42 Almost 4500 Americans died(31,000+ injured) in the Iraq war for Oil, those numbers would dwarf what would happen in a war with #Iran , Which @realDonaldTrump just threatened!! He is trying to distract from the #Mueller investigation #TrumpRussia #IranDeal
4804 2018-05-08 18:36:40 Putin makes billions, literally, from higher oil prices.
4805 2018-05-08 18:36:38 45 and Putin want the oil, 45’s been talking about it ford years. Also except gas prices to go even higher now
4806 2018-05-08 18:36:37 holy shit my dad offered to just give me a 100 dollar bottle of cbd oil bc it didn't help his pain. he either feels guilty for threatening me 2 yrs ago or is trying to buy my affection but either way hell yea gimme that shit.
4807 2018-05-08 18:36:36 US oil companies need Americans to pay higher gas prices. Pulling out of the deal achieves that. The Oil companies thank Trump
4808 2018-05-08 18:36:35 i know nothing but sure that Iran deal suspension will end up with 140$  per barrel prices of oil, probably a weak later,
4809 2018-05-08 18:36:33 Good to see the oil hungry bell ends from across the Atlantic are doing bits in the interest of world peace


4810 2018-05-08 18:36:32 Hahaha by letting Russia and SA sell a barrel of oil at twice the price of Iran's? Yes he phucked you.
4811 2018-05-08 18:36:31 Lets see I don't see oil breaching USD 100 in long term, it will pull back again because Saudi's don't want to lose market share to US shell oil which becomes profitable for export above USD 70. May be short term oil rally on the cards.
4812 2018-05-08 18:36:24 Now that Trump has withdrawn from the Iranian deal, I’m wondering what the outlook for Oil prices will be. In the long term, higher prices. Short term?
4813 2018-05-08 18:36:18 ONLY reason we're out is because your sperm donor daddy is pissed he didn't make any money on the oil.  When we go to war, you & your even fooler brother better be prepared to be foot soldiers in the Army.
4814 2018-05-08 18:36:16 Why does your party continually make it sound as though "money is leaving?" In order to be a seller, there has to be a buyer. The oil is STILL in the ground. It didn't magically disappear.
4815 2018-05-08 18:36:11 Always thankful
4816 2018-05-08 18:36:05 It’s barely even a film- it’s a TV pilot about 30 years of Star Wars pop culture and it’s as visually imaginative as an average episode of Dr Who. Abrams is little more than a snake oil salesman.
4817 2018-05-08 18:36:03 a la mierda el oil
4818 2018-05-08 18:36:00 Our national security interests must be the oil Iran has right?
4819 2018-05-08 18:35:58 Time to test the limits on the “complimentary snacks and beverages” while waiting for my oil change. #runnerprobs #alwayshungry #ultrachat
4820 2018-05-08 18:35:53 Trump withdrew Iran US nuclear deal. Oil price will shoot up
4821 2018-05-08 18:35:52 Imagine when oil is no longer relevant and these issues cease to exist
4822 2018-05-08 18:35:40 Oil prices will go up just as the #Saudis wanted, but the irony is, it will benefit #Iran and #Russia equally. #IranDeal
4823 2018-05-08 18:35:37 Domestic oil will hold the line. Rather pay a little more then see a nuclear bomb land somewhere in the world  let alone the USA 
4824 2018-05-08 18:35:29 And we remember the drug comment he made as well. Trump is a snake oil salesman. At least with a snake oil sale, you get some snake oil. With Trump all we get is poison!
4825 2018-05-08 18:35:28 Ergonomic keybrd, voice typing w/ headset, stretch wrists & forearms, relax fingers, massage in essential oil 4 inflammatn, stress mngment.
4826 2018-05-08 18:35:27 Reimposing sanctions on #Iran, who has remained in compliance with the #IranDeal, for the #USA violating the #IranDeal makes us look like great good faith partners. Oh, Russia also gets to sell more oil to us with these sanctions being reimposed on Iran.
4827 2018-05-08 18:35:26 Oil prices will go up more then ever & Iran will go back to creating nuclear weapons due to this deal being terminated.
4828 2018-05-08 18:35:25 Plus, when the price of oil goes up (it will), Russia will be in much better shape. #PutinsPuppet #PutinsMonkey
4829 2018-05-08 18:35:24 Hmm rwcovery, Oil is near 70 bucks a barrel.  You have contributed nothing
4830 2018-05-08 18:35:24 Trump just endangered entire world, helped Putin, will cause price of oil to skyrocket.  Always makes the worst possible decision.  Threatens all other countries if they don't sanction as well.  Time to sanction the US by the rest of the world.
4831 2018-05-08 18:35:23 His cronies probably bought oil futures and will make a killing. Insider information. He probably decided at the low point of oil prices.And dramatically decided today.
4832 2018-05-08 18:35:21 trump thinks he needs a war to save his presidency and high oil prices to further enrich himself, his friends and PUTIN
4833 2018-05-08 18:35:13 You guys realize our allies buy oil from Iran and Trump just told our allies we will go after them.
4834 2018-05-08 18:35:11 My Take:  Speech on #IranDeal 

- Not restrictive enough as is
- Opens door to renegotiating
- Honors Iranian people 
- Mentions cooperation w/#Europe 
- Pivots to peace w/#NorthKorea
Oil -$1.70 
Stocks -0.3%
Dollar +0.3%
4835 2018-05-08 18:35:10 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
4836 2018-05-08 18:35:07 US end deal with Iran, expect hike in oil prices......  Difficult time for Pak
4837 2018-05-08 18:35:03 The #oil market seems taking Trump's statement as meaning something like 'I'm opening the negotiations; would see what it comes from here'. WTI back to $69 a barrel. Brent is below $75 a barrel. #OOTT #oil #OPEC
4838 2018-05-08 18:34:54 So the objective with all of that is to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb. They will just take all the data from North Korea. Oil ain't going down....the Dow seems confused...do I go up or do I stay down...
4839 2018-05-08 18:34:52 You guys want CBD oil for a product line?  Get at me
4840 2018-05-08 18:34:52 Umust b happy about current situation in BC.Good 4U, ruin the economy &associated jobs in the industry.pls let us know if u support Cda getting 650,000 barrels of oil from dictators using cargo ships?I'm guessing these dictators don't have a great human rights/climate plan?
4841 2018-05-08 18:34:51 Hmmm....how many of drumpf's friends in the oil industry will profit from the inevitable hike in oil prices, I wonder? And how much of that profit will be "funnelled" into trump coffers? Fucking criminal!
4842 2018-05-08 18:34:49 ladies n gentlemen we have officially broke up Iran deal complements of Mr 45 here we go with oil n wars on rise , funny I seen mr45exting thej u seen Bolton by the door eating with him wow!
4843 2018-05-08 18:34:46 If you have an Extended Warranty and need repairs done we will provide you with a FREE OIL CHANGE. Offer only valid with a qualifying extended warranty policy. Pay little to nothing with us at Prestige Collections.
4844 2018-05-08 18:34:44 US oil further narrowing losses on Trump officially announcing pulling out of #IranDeal. oil down 1.6% vs more than 3% earlier.
4845 2018-05-08 18:34:37 Killing the Iran deal will make Iran feel less safe, they will return to the global arms race to acquire nuclear missiles, and they in return will stop shipping oil to America. So is the goal to find CIA reports of WMD there, another gulf war and then have oil contracts?
4846 2018-05-08 18:34:33 the problem is that no one knows how Iranians think, and how they are. They have oil they have money, they are not like North Korea. How many of people in administration knows about Iran? And this president is so stupid.
4847 2018-05-08 18:34:33 Short oil 69.04 TP 68.30
4848 2018-05-08 18:34:32 Not even answering the important question. America how can you continue to tolerate this man who makes his decisions on how much people will pay him. NRA, Israel, Putin, Koch brothers, oil corps, Qatar. To name a few.
4849 2018-05-08 18:34:29 That’s too far fetched an idea. But, nothing is certain these days. I guess we’ll be back to clearing the outstanding oil payments through escrow accounts as the best option available. What are the other major concerns for New Delhi except the oil import?
4850 2018-05-08 18:34:27 Tax cuts for all citizens, record number of jobs and lowest unemployment in several decades, ISIS defeated from Obama's pull out of leaving 1000s of US Humvees and weapons for them to collect along with oil to make millions, Obama's rules of engagement gone leading to less deaths
4851 2018-05-08 18:34:24 And guess who wants us alienated from our former friends, preferably while driving up global oil prices? Rhymes with Bladimir Scootin.
4852 2018-05-08 18:34:22 A fact which HELPS Putin: the Russian economy is increasingly depending on rising worth their oil reserves to counter the effects with US-imposed sanctions (under BO).
4853 2018-05-08 18:34:21 Yes.. Brace up for a Oil shock if not war !!
4854 2018-05-08 18:34:13 Sounds like iranians would like to be like Syrians or irakians?? Once Americans enter your home....they only come for oil, gold and Gus....!
4855 2018-05-08 18:34:08 How does this help America at all? Russia is now the go-to in the area for their oil. This only helps Russia.
4856 2018-05-08 18:34:07 Trump's Iran announcement pleases:
1) Oil producers in Texas
2) Oil producers in Saudi Arabia
3) GOP core supporters
4) Netanyahu
5) Arms producers
6) Putin, most of all Putin
7) Foes of NATO
8) Foes of European Union
9) Koch Boys
10) NRA
4857 2018-05-08 18:34:05 Germany - Oil consumption

1997:  2.9 million barrels per day
2002: 2.7 million barrels per day
2015: 2.3 million barrels per day

(BP) #0urWorld #Oil #Germany
4858 2018-05-08 18:34:04 Yes they are licking their lips at the prospect of money both from weapons of war & taking their oil + personal business expansion in Israel.
4859 2018-05-08 18:34:02 Baby oil. Cool or warmed.
4860 2018-05-08 18:34:00 @realDonaldTrump has got to be the most crooked and most stupid person to ever be potus. Everything he does helps Putin. Withdrawing from the Iran deal divides us from our allies. It makes oil more expensive. It empowers Putin and makes him very happy. #TheKremlinDon
4861 2018-05-08 18:34:00 Israel thanks @POTUS for his actions against Iran! Not surprising... Oil now down almost 1% #USA #oilprices
4862 2018-05-08 18:33:58 Actually, this one I think is completely about the oil.
4863 2018-05-08 18:33:54 I just discovered we have public option MCT oil at the office (for now).
4864 2018-05-08 18:33:51 Why is oil dropping Chaz ? I thought it will be up as Iran deal is cancelled
4865 2018-05-08 18:33:51 Last time we had $70 oil, where was the CAD
4866 2018-05-08 18:33:47 Sanctions on Iranian oil sales. Nuclear weapon building. Idk Just don’t let this gas skyrocket.
4867 2018-05-08 18:33:46 You do know that the US exports over 2 million barrels of crude oil every day and still imports 1 million a day from the Saudis, right?
4868 2018-05-08 18:33:46 Won’t this spike oil prices? Who benefits from that? Putin
4869 2018-05-08 18:33:44 Open agitation to create a civil war in Iran supported by USA and KSA , Why? Reason 1- Iran is supporting Iraq and Syria against Isıs,Nusra,Al-Queda which are founded by USA , Israel and KSA , 2-Iran decided to sell its Oil and Natural gas with Euro instead of USD as Saddam did.
4870 2018-05-08 18:33:44 Price of oil will go up. You still going to be able to slick your hair?
4871 2018-05-08 18:33:38 — So let use off be octo while oil bike the bil and wheel whang till wabblin befoul you but mere and mire trullopes will knaver mate a game
4872 2018-05-08 18:33:37 Oh, come on, Ben. What could giving billions of dollars and opening the world's marketplaces for them to sell their oil for hard currency and buy anything they want possibly do to advance terrorism? Their terrorism goal was just to could get 4K TVs. Pixelation begets violence.
4873 2018-05-08 18:33:36 Trump ya salio a carajear a los iranies.... Que espera el $OIL para subir???
4874 2018-05-08 18:33:28 My dad ripped the shit out of me because I don’t know how to put oil in my car  do I look like a mechanic
4875 2018-05-08 18:33:25 I discovered an artist who has created some amazing mermaid oil paintings and now I want to buy ALL THE MERMAID ART! 
4876 2018-05-08 18:33:25 And again @realDonaldTrump it is all about the dark #gold named #oil .
Now Iran will start to enrich uranium. Hope the #world stays safe, I would love to see my #children someday.
4877 2018-05-08 18:33:22 Iranian Oil will be shut out of market... And crude will jump once sanctions are in place.
4878 2018-05-08 18:33:18 It has to do with Israel & if they can get us into a declared war, stopping the midterm election. Also helping to raise oil prices. Oil & $$
4879 2018-05-08 18:33:17 I would suck on some toes covered in oil!☻ #ORIGINPCLIVE
4880 2018-05-08 18:33:05 Expect Oil To Go Camping While We Get Some Others War Suckers....#breaking #GodBlessTheMotherLand
4881 2018-05-08 18:33:00 How much more proof do people need to see that tRump is working FOR Putin and AGAINST the United States?!! He went against our Allies and did EXACTLY what Putin wanted him to do! We'll be at war with Iran in less than 6 months - watch! Oil & Gas is about to skyrocket! #Screwed
4882 2018-05-08 18:32:56 Peppermint oil is the best for beauty. You could use coarse sea salt and  rinse it off for deep cleansing and to get rid of dead skin cells. Then  use crushed rose petals. You could try aloe vera. I don't know how any  of this would interact with retin-A or ostomy medications.
4883 2018-05-08 18:32:55 US has pulled out of Iran deal. It's reimposing sanctions. Which means Iranian Oil is now off the market. Oil prices will shoot up, and Exxon and other cronies will make more money.
4884 2018-05-08 18:32:50 Oil traders and defence players
4885 2018-05-08 18:32:49 Trump decided to walk out of Iran deal. Expect oil price surge. Expect paradigm change in gulf politics.

Focus shifting from North Korea to Iran now. Brace for war or words, unlikely a happy ending. 

Nobel peace prize a bigger joke now!

#IranNuclearDeal
4886 2018-05-08 18:32:47 Keep an eye, bet we'll be importing more oil from Russia soon.
4887 2018-05-08 18:32:45 I use some lush products , and for my moisturizer aloe Vera gel mixed with vitamin e oil.
4888 2018-05-08 18:32:44 I couldn’t listen anymore to him, my ears started bleeding
4889 2018-05-08 18:32:40 My first reading of the White House document - US is pulling out and reimposing not just oil sanctions but will target Irans economy and everyone who does business with Iran
4890 2018-05-08 18:32:36 Thank you for your reply , please tell us where " sustainable sources" of palm oil are from ?
4891 2018-05-08 18:32:29 It's a good thing I don't trade oil. This just confuses me.
4892 2018-05-08 18:32:26 This is good, #PIGB was passed as to bring ease to all stakeholders in the oil industry and at the same time a good service to the Nigerians, the priority given to the host community who have lacked proper consideration by the oil sector should also be welcome by all.
4893 2018-05-08 18:32:25 Trump to impose economic sanctions on Iran and anyone that uses their oil. They own over 5% of the world's oil supply, I'm sure someone will do business with them. Trump going to sanction the world? Good luck! U.S is isolating itself....
4894 2018-05-08 18:32:23 North Korea just got a call from Iran, they said hey need some oil?
4895 2018-05-08 18:32:22 Oil has lost $1/barrel during the last 10 minutes.....
4896 2018-05-08 18:32:21 Our Flowery Earl Grey is amazing for shortbread as it has the highest concentration of Bergamot Oil. Matcha would also be a great choice!
4897 2018-05-08 18:32:21 this is the setup to start importing russian oil and start a war with Iran
4898 2018-05-08 18:32:21 They need to push Iran out of global oil markets any way they can.  The Saudis need $88 a barrel oil.
4899 2018-05-08 18:32:09 In addition to dividing us from our most reliable allies & totally destroying our credibility to comply with negotiated deals we will see much higher oil and gas prices. Why would any nation or nations negotiate anything with our country?
4900 2018-05-08 18:32:08 Oil applied or stone is carved that way?
4901 2018-05-08 18:32:07 @realDonaldTrump Any country or group that makes a deal with this idiot is stupid. Dump is a lying piece of . More lying to the American people again. When oil prices go through the roof it's your fault.
4902 2018-05-08 18:32:00 It’s official: President Trump is pulling the United States 
out of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump’s decision was announced in a Tuesday afternoon White House address, he announced that he would reimpose sanctions on Iran’s oil sector that had been lifted as part of the agreement
4903 2018-05-08 18:32:00 U.S withdrawal from Iran deal. Now oil prices touching $80p/b is in sight.
4904 2018-05-08 18:31:57 But moment Iran switched from $ to € for Oil Trade well that was when fate of this deal was sealed. Its over.. !!
4905 2018-05-08 18:31:54 Dear @VodafoneIN what the fuck is wrong with you. Why is your 4G slower than that of a snail. I got stuck twice 
Location one : Prime focus,  Royal Palms
Location two : Marol Naka, indian oil petrol pump. Couldn't make payment thru @Paytm Even after wasting 10 mins amd 3 refresh
4906 2018-05-08 18:31:50 Bad days ahead for India if breaches USD 80 mark but that brings US shell oil back into business which put pressure of Saudi's & other OPEC nation to withdraw their oil deal.
4907 2018-05-08 18:31:50 And the cost of gas and oil will rise and rise. Thanks, Trump.
4908 2018-05-08 18:31:49 Watch the oil prices rise
4909 2018-05-08 18:31:47 @MSNBC  Do all you trump folks like the fact that he is selling off our national parks to the oil ppl?  Wait till he gets to your state!
4910 2018-05-08 18:31:46 Just a reminder......in 1987, the U.S. bombed an Iranian oil platform the weekend before the Crash.
4911 2018-05-08 18:31:40 If he resinstates sanctions, including those that restrict Iranian oil exports, it is a potentially crippling blow to world economies. And Saudi Arabia is withholding exports from the US as well.
4912 2018-05-08 18:31:35 Back to fundamentals for Oil again. Tomorrow’s EIA report should be more important then usual
4913 2018-05-08 18:31:35 Just use natural herbs stuff , the chemical made things don’t clear your skin, they hide the bumps that will eventually return. Shea butter, coconut nut oil, and black soap does miracles
4914 2018-05-08 18:31:29 am i the only one that likes the smell of olive oil
4915 2018-05-08 18:31:28 He's trying to raise the price of oil for his oil-baron friends.
4916 2018-05-08 18:31:23 That was the plan oil and gas always booms (money wise) in the US when a repulican is in office.  They get major contributions from oil and gas companies to make sure they make a ton of money
4917 2018-05-08 18:31:21 Coal mines and oil/gas fields vs cattlemen. Most of the strife is government level though.

The real war is between oil rig hands on leave in town and normal human beings.
4918 2018-05-08 18:31:20 Now that good news for the United State economy Since U.S can now export oil . You really need do research or at least  listen to the nees,
4919 2018-05-08 18:31:19 Until either all the oil is gone, or we don't need it anymore.
4920 2018-05-08 18:31:17 The real consequences will be: raise of oil barrel; slowdown the economy growth; an excuse to start selling more weapons! The Bush-Cheney strategy!
4921 2018-05-08 18:31:14 Oil cost gonna high now?
4922 2018-05-08 18:31:12 This fucker catering to his fucking base is going to get us all killed. Whether it is from war, climate change or EPA allowing pesticides in our food or polluting our water due to oil leaks and shit getting into them. #BlueWave2018 #GOPComplicit #FireproofMueller.
4923 2018-05-08 18:31:12 At this point him and DefRozen are like oil & water....,Don't mix!
4924 2018-05-08 18:31:12 What will happen to the oil price? #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
4925 2018-05-08 18:31:08 good job I've been storing these 1,000 barrels of noxious crude oil in my basement.
4926 2018-05-08 18:31:06 Sad you don't like olives, though glad you cook with olive oil.
4927 2018-05-08 18:31:05 PURE Spearmint Essential Oil,
Smells so good.
4928 2018-05-08 18:31:03 Temizleyici olarak mac cleanse off oil kullanıyorum
4929 2018-05-08 18:31:02 I don't mean oil smears from my hands  I mean actual paint or pencil swipes on the art because it registered my hand movements on the screen and made the app write.
4930 2018-05-08 18:31:01 Forgot I need an oil change
4931 2018-05-08 18:30:59 #BREAKING: Oil prices recoup losses after Trump quits #Irandeal and pledges 'highest level' of economic sanctions #WTI #BrentOil #OOTT #OPEC
4932 2018-05-08 18:30:57 it seems like the Trump adminstration is doing everything in their power to spike oil prices higher over the course of this adminstration. I wonder how the consumer feels about a depressed dollar & soaring commodity prices? #OOTT
4933 2018-05-08 18:30:56 Getting an oil change done on my own for once #NotAnIndependentWoman #IMissMyDad
4934 2018-05-08 18:30:56 Just spent 30 quid on a hair product. If it turns out to be snake oil I will be furious.
4935 2018-05-08 18:30:56 Iran can also rally its people around hating the US and moves us further from peace in the Middle East. Not that that has ever happened. Defense and oil stocks higher. $NOC $EOG
4936 2018-05-08 18:30:56 also: he's destroying the case for using sanctions as foreign policy. Entire goal of sanctions is to secure deals. If we don't get deals, we might as well eat all the pistachios and burn all the oil Iran is willing to send us.
4937 2018-05-08 18:30:52 Up and down..which is why I’m confused cuz he market clearly said last night via #news if he withdraws the #dow will be hurting due to the oilBut whatever on that..his reasons make NO SENSE
4938 2018-05-08 18:30:49 Lmao I’ll be on after this oil change an car wash
4939 2018-05-08 18:30:43 Yeah. & you can give her some gas drops right afterwards. It should flush her.  But not too much olive oil you don’t wanna clogg her even more. Get a syringe use a dose of 0.3
4940 2018-05-08 18:30:42 Why not become a rich oil and gas woman...instead of waiting for a male economic messiah
4941 2018-05-08 18:30:42 Pretty sure this Trump Iran shxt got something to do with oil
4942 2018-05-08 18:30:41 Make no mistake - if @realDonaldTrump backs out of Iran Deal, it is to serve his Russian master's interests. Sanctioning flow of Iranian oil increases the price and flow of Russian oil significantly. #IranDeal
4943 2018-05-08 18:30:40 A lot of interest and credibility on that fine since the 60's...Bernie will always be the People's champ. Unlike your corporatist neolibleral war monger who pretends she has a heart while taking billions from big oil, big pharma, the prison industrial complex and corporate donors
4944 2018-05-08 18:30:37 Do you know the function of transmission fluid? This fluid not only provides a similar service to the transmission as motor oil does to the engine, it acts as a hydraulic fluid to acid in shifting transmission gears.
4945 2018-05-08 18:30:37 Never forget that the last time Netanyahu provided "evidence" of WMDs to the US it led to the Iraq War. Trump promised to end US interference abroad, but has surrounded himself with warmongers for his greater goal of driving up the price of oil for his boss, thru a war with Iran.
4946 2018-05-08 18:30:36 .@Ka012414 $4+ gas has happened before, had nothing to do with Iran.  We essentially have oil independence now, blame Wall Street for price gouging.
4947 2018-05-08 18:30:29 How much oil is in Iran?  Our Money grubbing president I think is on the sent of oil!  Watch his dogs!

4953 2018-05-08 18:30:23 Oil cuts losses as Trump announces withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal
4954 2018-05-08 18:30:23 Hey I'm a liberal and the only thing coming out of my mouth is stupidity . Gas prices is controlled by OPEC and Russia , dummy. DEMS taxing the hell out of it . How to insulate drill for your own oil . Liberals oppose .
4955 2018-05-08 18:30:23 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

4957 2018-05-08 18:30:18 Will The announcement of withdrawal from Iran Nuclear Deal make negative impact on global economy especially Oil and Gas economy ?
RT if your answer is 'Yes' .
4958 2018-05-08 18:30:17 .@Valvoline - not sure why I can buy a Groupon for an oil change only to have your store inform me that I can't use it today. Bad customer service.
4959 2018-05-08 18:30:13 Dude oil
4960 2018-05-08 18:30:11 Need To Get A Oil Change But I Hate Doing That
4961 2018-05-08 18:30:10 Angel Trumpets (Datura) v hallucinogenic.  Ricin (Castor Oil Plant) also deadly. Happy plant hunting!
4962 2018-05-08 18:30:07 Only in America do gas prices go up when a Republican is in the White House!  We are told “shortages” and oil companies make ungodly profits!
4963 2018-05-08 18:30:06 Dear Lord, please send me a client for the kind of brief I’ve been getting. Sometimes I’m scared to call the amount. Where will I see someone that wants to buy a $15m oil and gas company? 
Jesus pa idigi by jiri o!
4964 2018-05-08 18:30:05 If only we hadn’t toppled Mossadegh over oil profits, we wouldn’t be having all these problems. #IranDeal
4965 2018-05-08 18:30:04 Looks like we're going o be collecting oil in rubber suits.
4966 2018-05-08 18:30:02 Killing millions by doing the work of oil corporations, bankers, defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and Israel. Now maybe you can tell me how this is making America great again?
4967 2018-05-08 18:29:57 Nice!  Missed the re-entry, annoyed.  I was out and just got back when it started to run.
Its ok - I killed another $USO weekly 14C trade.  Oil didn't move initially yet from 3 words in you knew the outcome
4968 2018-05-08 18:29:56 @Edenny Sectors, #Transportation, # Oil & Gas, #Structures & Housing, #Urban & Rural Development, # Water & Sanitation, #Economic Studies.
4969 2018-05-08 18:29:53 It's not straight forward like that. several contracts entered into in recent months have been tampered with and oil demand which was rising steadily may have taken a little nudge downwards.
4970 2018-05-08 18:29:52 the oil bounce lasted about 3 minutes.
4971 2018-05-08 18:29:52 Oil prices go up, and so does the dollar. In the short run, everything becomes even more volatile.
4972 2018-05-08 18:29:51 $SPY $SPX $USO and markets and oil reversing lower again
4973 2018-05-08 18:29:50 Save the Bays chairman warns on oil &#39;dark ages&#39;...
4974 2018-05-08 18:29:45 Still say sell the news:oil
4975 2018-05-08 18:29:40 It is also to throw Irans oil prodn out of whack, which will raise the price of oil worldwide and benefit Putinovski, who basically depends on oil/gas for real money.
4976 2018-05-08 18:29:39 Yes, he also knows if oil goes up, putin gets richer. And his share of Rosneft goes up.
4977 2018-05-08 18:29:39 Is there money in it for him or his oil cronies?  There usually is money at the root of all his decisions.
4978 2018-05-08 18:29:33 Avocado oil, organic ghee or extra virgin olive oil
4979 2018-05-08 18:29:31 As long as they are runny/snotty. Then you add a few rashers...well it ends up like a full English on 4 slices of toast. Bang goes the waistline. Fried eggs in olive oil are ok.
4980 2018-05-08 18:29:28 @NicolleDWallace @maddow Russian oil benefits from the sanctions on Iranian oil. This is apparent right???
4981 2018-05-08 18:29:27 Un poco volatil el OIL hoy .....@chigrl
4982 2018-05-08 18:29:26 Dude changing my oil said “please just hit it one time when you get out of here. I love your car” 
4983 2018-05-08 18:29:24 Like everything else today, this announcement has me confused. 
Why is it bearish/bullish oil?  
The U.S. doesn't import oil from Iran (if I recall correctly). 
Other than declaring war, how does the U.S. stop Iran from exporting oil? 
Maybe it has something to do with RINS.
4984 2018-05-08 18:29:24 Dowced myself in coconut oil so we’ll see if it helps me tan or burn ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4985 2018-05-08 18:29:22 Scums want to kill more innocent people for OIL
4986 2018-05-08 18:29:18 @maritimedabs Went from down 160, now up now in oil fund.
4987 2018-05-08 18:29:17 Bio Oil is under rated.
4988 2018-05-08 18:29:16 So that he can impose sanctions raising the price of oil...This summer, expect gas to hit $5/gallon.
4989 2018-05-08 18:29:14 They will say thanks but Iran just called and said they have some oil for us
4990 2018-05-08 18:29:13 Trump clearly doesn't like fact US isn't involved  in the oil deals in Iran and so wants to 're negotiate..   so much for being against nuclear weapons !
4991 2018-05-08 18:29:08 Ahhh shit there goes Oil
4992 2018-05-08 18:29:07 That oil spike might be short lived.
4993 2018-05-08 18:29:06 So oil price is not decided by oil companies but at the direction of centre government oil companies are deciding it. Centre government does it in the favors of oil companies except rogue bjp action like in k’nataka election time. BJPigs
4994 2018-05-08 18:29:05 #irandeal Hey Trump ;  do whatever it takes to help my oil stocks,  thats the most important thing.
4995 2018-05-08 18:29:04 Oil prices are making a comeback as President Trump announces the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.

In volatile trading, US crude is down about 1% for the day. It was down as much as 4.4% earlier.
4996 2018-05-08 18:29:04 sitting here waiting while my oil is getting changed and this couple next to me are fighting bc she won’t give him his phone lmao all she keeps sayin is “foo don’t play with me”
4997 2018-05-08 18:29:01 Ok going back to oil markets, don't expect the impact on Iranian oil exports to be immediate or for #saudi Arabia to start making up for the loss right away #OOTT #sanctions #trump
4998 2018-05-08 18:28:52 Hmm....tell me about the oil prices after the Americans withdraw from the Iranian deal  tomorrow is a good green day for oil market 
4999 2018-05-08 18:28:52 Great connection to make there w/#ParisAgreement, with the added link between the two of what expiration of #Iran deal will mean for #oil & #energy markets
5000 2018-05-08 18:28:51 Iran deal scrapped. Now Tehran and OPEC can raise oil prices sky high.
5001 2018-05-08 18:28:48 Conversation #1 - slimy looking business guy is making a pitch to someone who looks like Chevy Chase (socks and teva sandals!) to invest in a GE windfarm by the oil sands and encouraging him to do so before the slimy business man himself can snap it up.
5002 2018-05-08 18:28:47 No prob! Add some olive oil too!
5003 2018-05-08 18:28:45 The fireworks in the market happened today well before President Trump made #IranDeal announcement...now that it's done, it's being digested relatively well, with oil prices steady & stocks pretty flat
5004 2018-05-08 18:28:44 How far do you think oil prices will jump now? #Trump #IranNuclearDeal
5005 2018-05-08 18:28:42 Good News China and Russia,
You just got a screaming deal on Iranian oil.
5006 2018-05-08 18:28:42 Trump pulling out of Iran deal and oil is down lol. First and second order thinking no longer applies in markets. Old people out of the way.
5007 2018-05-08 18:28:40 Go big on oil and cobalt
5008 2018-05-08 18:28:36 There's your answer.  Fake-out breakdown.  As to the over 70 break out.  I imagine most big players are pumping for higher oil prices for Aramco
5009 2018-05-08 18:28:31 It hurts my ego to pay someone to change my oil but it’s so hard to lift my stupid car up high enough to change it myself 
5010 2018-05-08 18:28:29 Trump won't respond to "How does this make America safer?" Just points finger: "This will make America safer." Bottom line: US gov policy makes US people less safe, but is great for expansionist Israel, imperial impulses, military contractors, Saudi authoritarians & some oil cos.
5011 2018-05-08 18:28:25 #WALL STREET BAND BOYS DON'T PLAY WITH THE MATH! #OIL WORKS ON OLD SCHOOL MATH! IT'S JUST LIKE #KITCHEN TABLE MATH! IT WORKS!
5012 2018-05-08 18:28:23 It’s American shale oil that needs higher prices
5013 2018-05-08 18:28:21 Their glycolic acid toner, squalane oil, and granactive retinoid 2% emulsion are my holy grail products
5014 2018-05-08 18:28:19 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 70.38. #forex #CRUDEOIL
5015 2018-05-08 18:28:15 And an imp question, how will US withdrael followed up by Economic Sanctions effect India??? 3 areas of concern in order of priority -1) Chabahar 2) Import of crude oil and 3) export of basmati rice amongst others.
5016 2018-05-08 18:28:10 So what you are saying is, you bought into Russian oil futures.
5017 2018-05-08 18:28:09 This is wonderful,

We must resolve the problems in the oil sectors, this meeting with the key players in oil industry should enhance the performance of small companies and refineries that are also capable of turning around the petroleum industry to an active one.
5018 2018-05-08 18:28:07 That's why @realDonaldTrump will talk tough on Iran sanctions and then actually do nothing. Meanwhile, if Israel starts bombing Iranian Nuke facilities, price of oil gores up, Putin benefits.
5019 2018-05-08 18:28:05 Trump announces US will leave Iran nuclear agreement.
#ICM #Economy #Politics #US #Iran #Trump #Oil
5020 2018-05-08 18:28:03 I know it’s a nuclear deal but I’m SURE oil is somewhere up in there. Please stop.
5021 2018-05-08 18:28:01 Oil will go up...helping the Russians.  Hmmmmmm
5022 2018-05-08 18:28:00 Trump pulls the US from Iranian deal, expect a spike in crude oil prices within the next 24hrs.... Temporary or Longterm price? Time will tell!
5023 2018-05-08 18:28:00 Went for an oil change and an inspection and ended up with a new serpentine thingy majiggy in my car today. Go car!
5024 2018-05-08 18:27:58 Well at least now Putin can sell his oil at a higher price.
5025 2018-05-08 18:27:57 Expect oil price rise
5026 2018-05-08 18:27:56 The phrase "Our friends across the isle" is truth. 
They keep us fighting while the pendulum of power swings. Either way they win
5027 2018-05-08 18:27:55 So does everyone have to do what the US wants or get sanctioned too? Can countries or non-US firms opt-out? What happens next? Is oil going to spike? What about Saudi?
5028 2018-05-08 18:27:51 Oil: buy
5029 2018-05-08 18:27:43 And the crumbs given to the masses in the tax plan will now be passed along to the oil companies...
5030 2018-05-08 18:27:43 #Oil trims earlier losses after President Trump @realDonaldTrump announces US exit from #IranNuclearDeal -$1.35 to $69.38/brl #Dow turns positive +14, SP500 -1, #NASDAQ -1 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
5031 2018-05-08 18:27:42 The previous dictatorship of the Shah having been put in power by the US when we overthrew their democratically elected leader to serve Anglo-American oil interests. Never ending blowback.
5032 2018-05-08 18:27:41 The Federal Reserve was a device of Wall Street.
It created unlimited new paper money in crises. 
The money was turned over to Big Banks which loaned it to Big Business.
When a panic hit,
the big fellows were saved,
but the little fellows went to the wall.

5033 2018-05-08 18:27:39 Things are about to get interesting then. 
They have several oil field licences that they cant develop or produce if they are under sanction again.
So much for maximum economic recovery. Tax payers about to get screwed again.
5034 2018-05-08 18:27:36 So the tally comes in, NI on the lowest state pension, waspi, stripping the NHS & bus passes, dementia tax, shut banks plus low interest, and probably suffered directly or indirectly by the oil wealth of Scotland being stolen that enabled yerd closures.

Sell me again on union.
5035 2018-05-08 18:27:35 Not sure of that either though would likely make oil prices rise. Probably what they want is a war

5039 2018-05-08 18:27:31 It's done , US is out . Oil is gonna touch 100 soon . Then it's IPO time . 
5040 2018-05-08 18:27:30 Welp, guarantee oil and gas prices are going to skyrocket now.

5051 2018-05-08 18:27:11 After your pristine call on buying commodities at bottom, shouldn’t the next logical step be to buy Emerging Markets today on Iran/oil news?
5052 2018-05-08 18:27:10 His primary purpose is to drive up oil prices, divide our allies and start a war.
5053 2018-05-08 18:27:03 Gee, sir, I wonder if the mining of the Strait of Hormuz would increase Russian oil prices?
5054 2018-05-08 18:26:58 (One is a big bottle of Sunday Riley Luna oil. Whoever got my single caviar stick instead of that is pissed.)

5057 2018-05-08 18:26:43 "Highest level of economic sanctions"  - if it means oil sales, banks, the works, and 3rd parties like European businesses - leaves Iran not much choice. They'll have to say something harsh now.

5059 2018-05-08 18:26:26 Decades of yo-yo funding tends to do that. We've cut funding because oil prices dropped then panicked and tossed a bunch of money at the system when oil went up and service was hurt, without thought and repeated the cycle with the swings in oil prices.
5060 2018-05-08 18:26:22 I'd like to thank Agent @realDonaldTrump for raising the oil price and saving the Russian economy.
5061 2018-05-08 18:26:22 Donald Trump pulls out of #IranNuclearDeal. Price of oil to increase. Corrupt and pot bellied Nigeria politicians happy as enough oil money to be stolen
5062 2018-05-08 18:26:21 That's ridiculous. The oil is probably better than the meds.
5063 2018-05-08 18:26:20 Watch what happens to oil prices in just a moment #MAGA
5064 2018-05-08 18:26:13 "The oil will pay for the war"
5065 2018-05-08 18:26:11 Oil. It's all about oil. They can lie, and they have. But the truth will come out.
5066 2018-05-08 18:26:11 I just want to know what gel, custard, cream and oil @chadwickboseman  used in his hair last night?  Also, which sponge or style technique.  This is a need in my life. #MetGala
5067 2018-05-08 18:26:03 Oh fuck, it's as I predicted 3 weeks ago, the Iranians better start stocking up on dried and canned goods, the Yanks are coming for their oil !

Bets the Brits join in with gusto !
5068 2018-05-08 18:26:01 Now we know why they jammed those tax cuts through. Here comes higher oil prices folks. Stand by!
5069 2018-05-08 18:25:55 If anyone was wondering how much I drive for work- I’m 300 miles short of my next oil change... that’s dated for August 20th
5070 2018-05-08 18:25:53 Hope ya’ll missed them Bush era gas prices. Cheers to OPEC for exporting more oil to offset the massive spike the world is about to feel in oil and gas prices. Maybe? #MAGA 

If we’re lucky maybe we’re dodge fire and fury rhetoric that encourages armed conflict. So much winning.
5071 2018-05-08 18:25:53 Ok. One more war for OIL soon.
5072 2018-05-08 18:25:52 Dear #MAGA price of oil has increased over $1 under this president and this is just the beginning #IranDeal
5073 2018-05-08 18:25:52 now we need to get the money back in cash or oil
5074 2018-05-08 18:25:48 Are Da Vinci, yacht and chateau futures exhibiting their usual positive #oil correlations?
5075 2018-05-08 18:25:46 It’s all about the oil. Trump just put us all in danger.
5076 2018-05-08 18:25:46 I need to go get an oil change but idk what I’m doing. What if they over charge me? What if they try to do some extra shit idk about?

5083 2018-05-08 18:25:13 Time to go long on oil!
5084 2018-05-08 18:25:12 Oil prices were above $3 for much of Obama's tenure.
Why did Obama just sit back & let Putin get more money? 
5085 2018-05-08 18:25:11 oil price bouncing around like a bb in a boxcar.
5086 2018-05-08 18:25:10 trump is already talking about sanctions on Irans' oil. But no, it has nothing to do with oil.

Your home is full of oil products known as plastics.  There is literally no part of our lives not touched by oil or FF
5091 2018-05-08 18:25:05 Heavily invested in oil. Part of the reason there is such a push back on alternative fuels.
5092 2018-05-08 18:25:05 *sprinkles anointing oil*

5094 2018-05-08 18:25:01 War is wishful thinking on his part.
Remember how he famously thought US could go into Middle East countries "and keep the oil next time"?
Thinks in terms of spoils and riches, not diplomacy.

5100 2018-05-08 18:24:45 for the record, I don't support the decision today, but I also don't see $2.80 gas as a bad thing. It's not so high that it'll cripple retail/consumers, but it's high enough to help revitalize domestic oil exploration/production.
5101 2018-05-08 18:24:45 Another Republican in WH another unnecessary war in the Mid East. More American's lives lost or destroyed for some personal reason by the GOP for trump its oil. Ain't no one going to trump trump from anywhere in world.
5102 2018-05-08 18:24:43 Yay for $100 oil again. I mean, I was feeling pretty rich only paying $2.75/gl at the Mobile. I would much rather pay $5.
5103 2018-05-08 18:24:39 It's official! President Trump finally withdraws the United States from the Iran deal. 

Expect your gas and oil price to skyrocket than ever before.

No threat from #Iran has been implemented recently! An excuse to attack to gain more oil! @BarackObama wouldn't of let this happen @realDonaldTrump has

5114 2018-05-08 18:24:23 Trump move will now allow for major increase in oil price. Few weeks ago said it was too low
5115 2018-05-08 18:24:23 @BBC_HaveYourSay When are Muslims and Media going to realise that the whole story in the Middle East has always been about Oil and Gas and not Religion?
5116 2018-05-08 18:24:20 No it will not be government that changes the energy economy but it is government that is propping up the oil industry.

5123 2018-05-08 18:24:12 Trumps decision to sanction Iran will definitely affect global oil prices... Nigeria stands to gain from this I guess
5124 2018-05-08 18:24:12 And who benefits from oil not coming from Iran??? Well oddly enough, wait for it... Russia and the ogliarch’s
5125 2018-05-08 18:24:11 Any word on negotiations or extensions?
5126 2018-05-08 18:24:11 @chigrl Does reimposing sanctions on Iran include the amount of oil they can export?
5127 2018-05-08 18:24:08 Breaking news

Oil prices are going up therefore its time to buy some oil shares fir quick profit
5128 2018-05-08 18:24:05 You in your stupid obsession with undoing everything OBAMA has done, JUST PULLED OUT OF THE US'S ONLY MEANS TO VERIFY & CHECK IRAN'S WEAPONRY. YOU HAVE JUST SCREWED THE WORLD & SKY ROCKETED OIL PRICES!! GOD FREE US FROM THIS STUPID CORRUPT TYRRANT!

5133 2018-05-08 18:23:53 Thanks to trump, Oil prices are about to shoot up even further. #IranNuclearDeal
5134 2018-05-08 18:23:52 #oott is india allowed to buy iranian oil or is that considered assisting iran to acquire nuclear weapons ?
5135 2018-05-08 18:23:45 Yep, and that’s exactly what the US is pushing for. To isolate Iran & appease Israel whilst helping their “allies” Saudi Arabia in the process. 

Iran is struggling massively as it is and sanctions on oil exports would probably bring it to ruin within months, I reckon.
5136 2018-05-08 18:23:41 Shale oil needs those prices
5137 2018-05-08 18:23:37 Impact: Brent Oil comes back to $75+ levels. Risk of spike in oil price now is more real.
5138 2018-05-08 18:23:28 Are tanning oil and cooking spray the same thing?? Please advise.
5139 2018-05-08 18:23:25 "Powerful sanctions will go into full effect." Presumably on oil sales - but all the other stuff too? Banks etc?
5140 2018-05-08 18:23:20 Laao maal crude oil

5143 2018-05-08 18:23:10 First off, what he said was false.
Second off, the gas and oil prices will skyrocket.

So really, as usual, you're wrong.

5150 2018-05-08 18:23:04 What did I say last night about trumps decision on the Iran deal?  Part of the proposed sanctions include an embargo on their oil.  You think 3.00 gas is expensive.  Wait a month.  It will double.  Thanks POTUS.
5151 2018-05-08 18:23:03 It is kinda funny that Russia is going to benefit from Iran oil coming offline.  @cnn will be all over this

5153 2018-05-08 18:23:02 No I don’t, I think it’s stranger as the more people use it, the more we see the effects from thc metabolites. What’s the neem oil mechanism for its cause of cyclical vomiting? Just another reason to avoid daily abuse of this drug.
5154 2018-05-08 18:23:02 Trump will withdraw from the Iran deal! Sanctions back on! Oil up almost 1% #trump #Oil #usa #IranNuclearDeal
5155 2018-05-08 18:23:00 Nothing was going to change his mind.. this is about other things like driving up the price of oil
5156 2018-05-08 18:22:58 Saddam gassed the Kurds, probably under orders from Washington, because the Kurds at that time were calling for the removal of American oil companies from Iraq. There was no complaint from the U.S. until Saddam stopped attacking Iran. When he would no longer wage war, he was out.

5160 2018-05-08 18:22:47 Israel (a Middle East Nuclear State and enemy of Iran) relying on 10 year old ‘intelligence’ persuades clownstick Trump that #IranDeal is bad allowing Saudi Arabia (Iran’s enemy and economic competitor) to raise price of oil
5161 2018-05-08 18:22:45 It's good for oil.
5162 2018-05-08 18:22:41 We're already at a 3 yr high on gas & oil prices, get ready for another jump in prices! But hey, all Drumph's buddy's are in the oil biz, so it's cool...

5170 2018-05-08 18:22:24 Very vague term there. "Any nation who helps Iran" so if France and UK do not pull out and continue buying oil do we sanction them now? This go it alone mentality is extremely stupid. No replacement for JCPOA is very stupid.
5171 2018-05-08 18:22:16 USA withdraws from Iran deal. Now Iran would have some logic to mess around. OIL prices wud be effected.

This need not be said: But it's SO dangerous having a toddler as leader of the free world.
5182 2018-05-08 18:22:00 Don't make light of oil being a major factor in this. Oil is needed to make every piece of machinery work & w/o it you will see a catastrophe unfold around the world.  Wars have been fought over it and areas of the world deliberately destabilized b/c of it.
5183 2018-05-08 18:21:58 YES!!!!!!!!! We are out of the Iran Nuclear Deal!!!  Thank you @realDonaldTrump. Next up...oil prices need to plummet! #QAnon #IranDeal

5189 2018-05-08 18:21:37 And there it is. Trump says what the whole world apparently knew. US withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal. Market not really reacting though. Oil had already fallen.

5218 2018-05-08 18:20:37 Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal

Trump laundered money for the Iranian Rev Guard thru Trump International Hotel Baku. Hardliners win in Iran.

Russia's economy is in ruins. Russia wins when oil prices are higher allowing Putin to get more money.

It's all about money!
5219 2018-05-08 18:20:33 The entire goal is to drive up the price of oil benefiting Russia, SA, and R donors. The oil price increase is already netting Russia almost $90B a year...

Follow the money. This needs to be reported on. This is the quid pro quo.

5229 2018-05-08 18:20:09 One real life example on how the enemy works through fear is Sachangwan. After all the prayers, pouring oil, pouring salty water accidents still happen. Whilst driving and the car nears that place passengers and drivers start having fear of accidents. Conversations become sombre
5230 2018-05-08 18:20:08 Trump on Iran : more American lies on weapons of mass destruction.
What he really wants is to stop Iran selling its oil.
5231 2018-05-08 18:20:07 Well, Iran is selling oil since the sanctions were lifted to EU countries, so they have a vested interest in maintaining the present deal.
5232 2018-05-08 18:20:05 How effective will new US #sanctions be on #Iran? Depends on whether European buyers abide. If they don't cut Iranian imports, impact on markets will be minimal. Europe will have to choose between Iranian oil & US capital markets. What will EU companies like #Total & #ENI do?
5233 2018-05-08 18:20:04 Always good to be cautious but Saudi's oil is running dry. You won't hear that on MSM. America will be the powerhouse. Gas will go up for a bit but everyone needs to stay positive about the temporary pains.
5234 2018-05-08 18:19:57 Trump just cited Israel's presentation as definitive proof, the same presentation that provided NO PROOF, and NO EVIDENCE that wasn't already known as his reason for pulling out of the #IranDeal.

This is a disaster, unless you're a fan of war and people dying in the name of oil.
5235 2018-05-08 18:19:48 Trump, you will be hurting America if you don’t sign the Iran deal. Oil will go up and we will pay a very high price for gasoline and heating oil. Don’t undo it just because Obama placed it. Think of the millions of people you will be hurting. Think of your base.
5236 2018-05-08 18:19:42 Yes, we don’t need to fund Iran’s nuclear program or terrorist organizations that they support. There are plenty of oil producing countries who we are still allies with, so gas prices shouldn’t change too much because of this.
5237 2018-05-08 18:19:41 I have a dream that in the future the oil will stay in the ground and we will mine the air for CO2 because in the end, all we really  need is carbon, says @richnorthcote @The_GC3
5238 2018-05-08 18:19:39 I’d love to see him win the champs league with PSG but I’m not sure now his philosophy will match up with the oil money. He’s not gonna wanna go to a club just for the sake of it and not compete for the biggest honours
5239 2018-05-08 18:19:35 And when #oil prices rise as a result of sanctions and everyday Americans feel the economic crunch, his tweet last month has already set the stage for #OPEC to be the scapegoat
5240 2018-05-08 18:19:29 The #US is now a rogue state, #EU #UN must now distance themselves from #TheTrumpRegime and support #Iran. 
We must stop buying oil in #USDollars, move to either #Euro, #UKPound  or #Yen
This is war mongering at the highest level, not for the good of people anywhere.
5241 2018-05-08 18:19:24 Oil jumps higher as Trump steps out of Iran nuclear deal based on "definitive proof Iran lied about its nuclear program".

5244 2018-05-08 18:19:19 I am aware. Rising oil prices affects a whole host of other areas. We'll have to see what happens.
5245 2018-05-08 18:19:12 So, when we're done invading Iran, are we going to take their oil?
5246 2018-05-08 18:19:07 Oil pops!  Wonder why?

5249 2018-05-08 18:18:58 Gold and oil price jumping as Trump currently speaks on Iran.
5250 2018-05-08 18:18:56 Although there is a regulator in oil as pointed out...but do you mean there is no cartel if there is regulator ???...
5251 2018-05-08 18:18:56 Oil back in green/black during Trump speach. #oil #iran #trump
5252 2018-05-08 18:18:55 Say hullo to raised oil prices, as Saudi Arabia & Russia want, and a US president has made possible! Wonder what his cut is! Not to forget, bringing us closer to another war - a GOP wet dream #IranDeal #unitedstates #donaldtrump #stupidity #rightwing

Watching Trump, live (Is spam alive? Discuss.) indicating chimps are aspirational.

Contrasts, huh?
5254 2018-05-08 18:18:39 Not really. He just had no econ policy and leading from behind not inspirational. 
The econ recovered just bcse that's what it does.

5256 2018-05-08 18:18:34 E15 is not bad for engines 2001 and newer. Actually not bad for any engine. You must work for the oil industry? Gas from fossil fuels- More costly, not clean burning which pollutes the air.
5257 2018-05-08 18:18:32 Iran is going to raise the price of OIL
5258 2018-05-08 18:18:30 Let’s be honest, the only reason why Trump is pulling us out of the Iran Nuclear deal is so his oil friends can keep making more money. That’s why gas is skyrocketing in price once again.
5259 2018-05-08 18:18:27 Exactly and interference with UK Post ww2 to do oil deals that pretty much screwed Iran and benefited UK and USA companies

5265 2018-05-08 18:18:11 Ending the Iran Nuclear Deal doesn't increase our national security. It does eliminate another part of Obama's legacy, divides our allies for Putin, and makes a war with Iran more likely, helping drive up the price of oil, as I've always predicted would be a priority for Trump.
5266 2018-05-08 18:18:10 Trump, you will be hurting America if you don’t sign the Iran deal. Oil will go up and we will pay a very high price for gasoline and heating oil. Don’t undo it just because Obama placed it. Think of the millions of people you will be hurting. Think of your base.
5267 2018-05-08 18:18:07 We coming for your oil. #Trump
5268 2018-05-08 18:18:05 But, also helps Russia >pressure on oil supply, increases prices...good for Russia & moves Iran closer to Russian sphere of influence. Bibi already coordinating w/Putin, perhaps helping to create this tension-remember his Iraq WMD helped get into this sorry mess to start.
5269 2018-05-08 18:18:04 The absolute state of the Russian puppet. Is he spray painted orange? He’s doing exactly what Putin tells him. Oil price surge.
5270 2018-05-08 18:17:51 @ perfect skin twitter, what do you guys use as a spot treatment? My skin doesn’t like tea tree oil anymore
5271 2018-05-08 18:17:48 W/today's technology fossil fuels are not needed for energy production. Other sources do more, are cheaper & cleaner. However, fossil fuels are the basis for the economies of middle east oil producers & Russia. This is the basis of Trump's climate change denial & foreign policy
5272 2018-05-08 18:17:45 Gold n Oil

5273 2018-05-08 18:17:42 so Putin can make more profits on oil
5274 2018-05-08 18:17:41 Stocks are going to plummet, Gold and oil up ... lol this is so much fun.
5275 2018-05-08 18:17:34 If my daddy don’t hurry up and change my oil while he sitting in here on this damn phone 
5276 2018-05-08 18:17:34 Benjamin Netanyahu is calling shots here in alliance with Saudi oil barons who stand to lose out to Iranian oil & gas. Iran no longer threatens Israel & even has Jewish members of parliament. This is about US/Israeli power #C4News
5277 2018-05-08 18:17:30 Best thing for Iran to do is pump as much oil as possible to hurt the Saudis. Kick the masters dog to send him a message
5278 2018-05-08 18:17:29 Let’s be honest less than 20 years ago you weren’t even in the PL and then oil money cane in and your recent history began

5281 2018-05-08 18:17:20 He waits until the start of the summer driving season. He imposes sanctions on Venezuela on Monday, reimposes Sanctions on Iran on Tuesday. This is after we bomb Syria which already sent oil skyrocketing. WTF?
5282 2018-05-08 18:17:20 A Dangerous Game being played right now...... #OIL IMO
5283 2018-05-08 18:17:15 This asshole really is trying to kill us now. With the decision to leave the Iran deal gas will skyrocket beyond affordable for regular citizens. Oil hit a whopping $70 a barrel today. And Iran will develope weapons once again. This could cause war. Stock
5284 2018-05-08 18:17:13 Hi! You can also use banana or 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I hope this helps! Thank you!-Cheri

5287 2018-05-08 18:16:51 @realDonaldTrump Your decision to pull out of the Iran deal will raise gas prices across America & hit hard working citizens in their wallets, all the while as your Russian sugar daddy rakes in billions in higher oil prices. Fuck you! #IranDeal #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussia #Resist

5289 2018-05-08 18:16:46 Price of oil will be going up. Benefits Russia.
5290 2018-05-08 18:16:39 Putin likes (and influenced @POTUS ) withdrawal fm Iran Treaty. 

Drive up oil prices, inc instability. 

That $ goes to the Russians & their oligarchy & US Oil&Gas #ComplicitGOP.  

Weaken Europe & US. Russia uses that $ to strengthen selves & continue WAR on West.

5291 2018-05-08 18:16:32 Oil prices will be going up.  So gas prices will likely be $3.00 or over this summer.   Thanks Donald
5292 2018-05-08 18:16:23 The tangerine retard wants oil. Pipeline through Syria... Nom nom nom, tasty oil
5293 2018-05-08 18:16:17 The only war it may cause is oil price hikes.

Then I want McCain to have a Come To JESUS moment, switch parties, & tell the GOP to go covfefe themselves.  #ICanDream 
5300 2018-05-08 18:16:02 Oil itself is down 3%. So consumers will pay more because the price of crude dropped?
5301 2018-05-08 18:15:58 Absolutely correct. If oil continues to rise to 100$ will we go back to APM. Stick to the dismantled APM regime. Will payoff longer term
5302 2018-05-08 18:15:57 Damn oil changes really be breaking the bank 
5303 2018-05-08 18:15:56 If I was the German Chancellor I'd have nuclear bombs. Leave NATO. Do a De Gaulle & kick the Americans out. Seek better relations with the Kremlin (the Americans are bigger criminals), buy Russian oil/gas. Export to Russia. Require gold for exports to USA/UK. Threaten Trump with

5309 2018-05-08 18:15:47 Here goes #Trump speaking at the camera about #IranDeal and the way it sounds..he’s gonna fuck it up on another day..TODAY 

He has no clue how much we will loose in Iran with American companies there and 800,000 barrels of oil..watch the #dowjones after this
5310 2018-05-08 18:15:45 Fuckk, clean it with sea salt & water and put tea tree oil once it stops bleeding  take care
5311 2018-05-08 18:15:45 And drive up oil prices, which helps Russia (& Saudis, etc.)
5312 2018-05-08 18:15:43 But you still use palm oil, and it is generally known what devastating consequences that has not just for animals but the environment.
5313 2018-05-08 18:15:42 Expect CBI and oil not waived today. More waivers on Iran’s economy due in July.
5314 2018-05-08 18:15:40 Putin is advising him on this. Main way to make Russian economy great again is withdraw from Iran deal, fuel instability in the region and let oil prices rise. Then, if Israel / Iran war erupts possibly involving SA, Russia will be only stable large oil exporter for 3 continents.
5315 2018-05-08 18:15:38 Republicans want war with Iran for oil so badly.
5316 2018-05-08 18:15:38 @realDonaldTrump ALL of that 'small' tax cut you gave the average worker is now GONE due to the high oil prices. And the rich get richer... And us working class are still struggling to get to and from work, feed our families, and afford health insurance... #LIES
5317 2018-05-08 18:15:37 You understand this creates a giant arms race where companies make billions of dollars and will sky rockets oil prices
5318 2018-05-08 18:15:34 @RahulGandhi @ravishndtv @ppbajpai  it's proved whenever govt wants then only petrol and diesel prices increased at present due to election no price increase although crude oil prices increased to 75$ and it effects dollar strengthen against rupee all time high in last one year
5319 2018-05-08 18:15:30 Is gonna be a hot summer for oil. Wondering the change we making off $WTI would be good enough to afford gas this summer. #Trump is live1

5326 2018-05-08 18:15:11 Iran is not North Korea , unlike NK , Iran has vast amounts of oil and sanctions may not work like they did with NK .
If anything this is going to accelerate a confrontation between Iran and Israel .
5327 2018-05-08 18:15:06 my scalp is dry why has tea tree oil abandoned me like this?
5328 2018-05-08 18:15:02 OIL prices are about to go up after Donald Trump speech about Iran deal.

5335 2018-05-08 18:14:27 they don't understand technology and they focus on cash flow but cash is almost free right now real 10y us bond rate is 0.8%. So it's not a problem if $TSLA need cash that will be easy to find.
They can't go see Saudi or Norway they need to hedge oil exposure.
5336 2018-05-08 18:14:26 Oil!!
5337 2018-05-08 18:14:25 It depends on the cannabis extraction method used. I only use oil made from the CO2 extraction process.

5340 2018-05-08 18:14:12 PBR says its average global oil price during Q1 rose to $60.18/bbl from an average $54.04/bbl in Q4 2017.

5346 2018-05-08 18:13:31 After moving money to take advantage of oil prices.
5347 2018-05-08 18:13:30 but things like privatizing the oil or auctioning state landholdings or giving favorable terms to private-sector investors for power grid upgrades, while not great, are probably going to be the short-term solutions.

total auto-gol for the left, but that's the deal.
5348 2018-05-08 18:13:24 On a similar page. Went to the gym got an oil change and cut the grass.

5351 2018-05-08 18:13:19 My first girlfriend when I came back from flight school introduced me to Bio Oil. It's 8 years already and I've been using it since then. It's the best oil for my skin.

If that relationship hasn't added anything to your life, no matter how little, it's time to rethink it. Grow!
5352 2018-05-08 18:13:18 Just follow the money! at the end of the day, it's all about profit. #CancelledIranDeal >> Rising oil price >> benefits Oil Companies + Saudi Arabia !
5353 2018-05-08 18:13:18 And if we’re able to look into and unravel all the shell companies held by trump and his cronies we’d probably find a bunch of foreign investments in oil and arms that are set for record gains if this goes south...
5354 2018-05-08 18:13:14 Being suspicious of these things I wonder if Donnie Boy or any of his cohorts bought oil futures ahead of the announcement.
5355 2018-05-08 18:13:10 #Oil have prices dived as much as 4% after a @CNN report raised doubts about whether @realDonaldTrump would impose sanctions as quickly as the market had expected, a decision that would reduce global supplies of crude. @i24NEWS_EN
5356 2018-05-08 18:13:08 Why do you care about Oil prices? I thought all libtards would be driving EVs by now.
5357 2018-05-08 18:13:07 Here's a clue o checkers players! There won't be any disruption in Oil! USA is Awash in oil, nat gas! Also Israel! @realdonaldtrump has already made deals got Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, etc to keep pumping and join against Iran! So you oil  speculators drop dead
5358 2018-05-08 18:13:06 We don’t agree. I appreciate the conversation, especially, unlike many others; you never got personal and kept this to a civil exchange of opinions. I totally respect your right to have far different opinions than I do. Thanks!

5362 2018-05-08 18:12:56 Of course SA and Russia will make a lot of money selling America a barrel of oil at twice the price of Iran's.
5363 2018-05-08 18:12:56 Oil price ; more difficulty in paying for it and funding of Chabahar port. There won’t be international sanctions as US can’t get UNSC to undo deal. But US starts targeting companies that trade.

5367 2018-05-08 18:12:47 Trump doing Saudi Arabia’s bidding. Putin and KSA want oil prices to go up to continue giving cash to the Trump organization. Bastards.
5368 2018-05-08 18:12:40 Trump to announce the stance of US on Iran deal in a while. Stage is set to see if oil crosses $100

5371 2018-05-08 18:12:34 He doesn't care. The move will drive up oil prices (profits) & remove competition (Iran) from the US market.

Aren't sanctions useful for grifters?
5372 2018-05-08 18:12:29 So #Trump withdraws from #IranNuclearDeal  !!
This will help USA, Saudi and even Russia... thanks to increase in Oil prices.

5377 2018-05-08 18:12:05 And the EPA says it’s safe for any motor made after 2001. Check who is backing studies, big oil says it’s bad. Not surprising, EPA says it’s good (cleaner burning). Not surprising. So go with big oil if you want, but no matter what, all motors after 2012 are safe for E15.

5383 2018-05-08 18:11:30 Yes, since the times when the US financed and armed Saddam to use chem weapons against the Iranians in the '80s. If not when the US and the UK overthrew their democratically-elected Prime Minister for nationalizing oil back in '53.
5384 2018-05-08 18:11:30 Anything that gets oil over $120/bbl is their goal.
5385 2018-05-08 18:11:24 I don’t share the “doom and gloom” outlook. I think Trump is systematically destroying our freedoms and disgracing our country but you probably thought the same, incorrectly I might add; about Obama
5386 2018-05-08 18:11:23 Sandals touch the sand

I can sell oil like Afghanistan
5387 2018-05-08 18:11:23 Yea, we'll see if you're as tough on Wall and big oil as #Schneiderman was
5388 2018-05-08 18:11:19 This is the real struggle. Socialism over capitalism. Likely one belt one road, China 2025 will propel them ahead. Just a larger population

5396 2018-05-08 18:10:54 who's profiting off the oil spike this time?  Pence isn't an oilman that I know of.  Putin of course, but there has to be a domestic player too.  I'm sure halliburton already has the mopup contracts setup if we go to armed conflict
5397 2018-05-08 18:10:53 No. The documents collected proves they breached it all. And the Intel communities agree. Also the sanctions that obama lifted, allowed them to go from selling 1m barrels of oil a day to almost 2.5m. That supplies their war machine.

get wrekt world,
watch out
5400 2018-05-08 18:10:37 You make an excellent point there. This is about Oil, the only commodity Russia has. Under the #IranDeal stability oil prices came down & Russia's economy suffered. Under Trump & increased instability & fear of War, prices are going up. It's all about Petro dollars
5401 2018-05-08 18:10:36 when cooking meat, am i supposed to pour out the oil/fat that comes out? 
cause this is very oily and im thinking i shoulda dumped the oil and made my own sauce
5402 2018-05-08 18:10:29 I’m thinking this is more to do with oil than anything else
5403 2018-05-08 18:10:29 He definitely needs higher oil prices to fuel his economy.
5404 2018-05-08 18:10:28 Exactly he and Netanyahu want war so Israel gets more land Russia gets oil
5405 2018-05-08 18:10:27 ねむいー。ねよー
5406 2018-05-08 18:10:24 Now he can make a new deal as they are spent their funds. It didn’t go to their people but to war in Syria, Houtis,Hezbollah and Hamas. Russia has no money so they need to sell oil. If we put pressure on EU they might think twice who is more $$ to them Iran or US
5407 2018-05-08 18:10:20 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
5408 2018-05-08 18:10:19 Theater. Nothing more, nothing less. Iranian oil will make its way to markets one way or another. I don't expect a war.
5409 2018-05-08 18:10:16 Oil has never "traded" on supply and demand. Technically, it still is supply/demand, just not the underlying commodity.
5410 2018-05-08 18:10:15 Just got a brief; 

An oil and gas company in trans Amadi port Harcourt is up for sale with existing contracts, a club house and guest house and it belongs to a white man.

5412 2018-05-08 18:10:05 Crude oil only down 3%. Not too impressive
5413 2018-05-08 18:09:51 And don’t forget about the American companies that stand to make $$$ off the killing of the nuclear deal. I imagine our oil companies are happy today.

5417 2018-05-08 18:09:40 Nada. He will make money by rescinding. Oil
5418 2018-05-08 18:09:39 it's amazing, we're not even one generation removed from the last major oil spike due to foreign-policy idiocy causing a supply shock to a global commodity with inelastic demand.   What's that definition of #insanity again ?
5419 2018-05-08 18:09:26 They can't really afford to do that so they'll probably follow the sanctions regime (even if they don't want to).

This will reduce oil on international markets....thus $4/gasoline may come again. 

Wheeeeee!
5420 2018-05-08 18:09:23 Sweet. Three hours of uninterrupted play remaining.  Oil bee weighting...
5421 2018-05-08 18:09:21 @Oil_Tradr @oilfractals Well.....the dirty bastards are still trying. A minute after the Trump crap.
5422 2018-05-08 18:09:21 And the Republicans along with Trump will lead us into a war. Check who is padding their pockets with money from the price of oil going up.
5423 2018-05-08 18:09:19 Bipartisanship worked. But both parties are now to blame as they have abdicated the center. That’s why the American People so vehemently disapprove of Congress. It’s not the Dems or Republicans, it’s both. I’d say Republicans are more to blame, marching lock step; but I’m a Dem!
5424 2018-05-08 18:09:16 There are also suggestions that it will increase oil prices = good for Russia.
5425 2018-05-08 18:09:03 When @realDonaldTrump pulls the US out of the Iran deal we need to decimate @GOP in the midterms. This utter stupidity for his pride needs to be repaid in full. When our 401ks tumble and oil prices careen out of control, who to BLAME?but @GOP #Iran
5426 2018-05-08 18:09:00 and you spend your time protesting the pipeline.  Plastic is the worlds problem not oil
5427 2018-05-08 18:08:59 I suspect eventually takers will overwhelm the makers. It inevitable. Socialism will prevail. Just by sheer number China will overtake us

5431 2018-05-08 18:08:44 @DanaPerino So why are we exporting oil, and worrying about Iran’s gas prices!  More  meaningless nonsense and political mishmosh, with no way to fix stupid!
5432 2018-05-08 18:08:41 I'm wondering if more acres will go to corn based on higher oil prices (ethanol demand may increase) and away from beans because of the China trade uncertainty.

I don't trade commodities any more, so I haven't been paying close attention.
5433 2018-05-08 18:08:38 These comments are fucking brilliant, I never liked Jamie Oliver and his false sincerity and hypocrisy, especially when it came to food...high quantities sugar and a shit ton of olive oil in most things, healthy my arse 
5434 2018-05-08 18:08:37 Oil prices kept check in view of Karnataka elections. Nothing more nothing less. 
5435 2018-05-08 18:08:27 They include fragrance and carrier oil. The main goal is to give you an idea of how it would smell in a product base.
5436 2018-05-08 18:08:15 IMMINENT: @realDonaldTrump about to reveal his decision on Iran Nuke deal: we're watching the markets, oil, USD$, VIX. Now hitting the Reuters tape:   ISRAEL SAYS SPOTS IRANIAN MILITARY MOVEMENT IN SYRIA, ORDERS READYING OF BOMB SHELTERS ON ISRAELI-HELD GOLAN
5437 2018-05-08 18:08:14 I think this could be one of the trickiest bits - so hard to see how travel per se (unlike oil) can be replaced by something else: & there are enough postindustrial places in UK that are saved by tourism. Short of miraculously carbon neutral planes though, it must happen...
5438 2018-05-08 18:08:07 Not kidding. You asked a question, I answered. You are simply sowing division with your suppositions and inferences that have little basis. Has nothing to do with brown people vs "white christians". Dont be a bigot. It's about oil and financial usery.
5439 2018-05-08 18:08:05 But let's be real. This Iran deal is not about iran or nukes. It's about oil futures.  Sanctions against Iran means good things for other countries oil exports and oil futures in general.
5440 2018-05-08 18:08:05 You can solve that by finding a straightforward cookery book or just bake in oven with olive oil and whatever else you like to eat. Yum!
5441 2018-05-08 18:07:59 I see Trump is behaving like a toddler again, fucking moron. Negotiations done multilaterally tossed aside because the orange shit gibbon would love to start a war, so he can steal the oil presumably

5450 2018-05-08 18:07:24 Price of oil will soar, just what Putin wants.
5451 2018-05-08 18:07:20 We won't drive gasoline prices lower unless we simultaneously invest in more refineries as more oil is extracted.
5452 2018-05-08 18:07:17 Great now Saudi will have monopoly over oil, oil will sell at 100 dollars a barrel and I guess I'll buy a bicycle get shredded and look great.
5453 2018-05-08 18:07:14 More of a potential embarrassment, the rest of the countries that signed the deal just ignores the Trump. Russia will be VERY happy with the spike in crude oil prices.
5454 2018-05-08 18:07:08 Russia, MidEast, will increasingly trade with the world's largest oil importer in RMB, its already beginning and China is very deliberate about it. Of course, internationalization of RMB has a long way to go but the US is feeding other countries' incentives to make the shift.
5455 2018-05-08 18:07:02 If you want to put pressure on Russia you lower the price of oil not increase it.

Fuck Tre45on, Bolton, Bibi, etc getting us out of the #IranDeal it wasn't perfect but it could have been tweaked. Instead they want to trigger a war with Iran & raise oil prices.
5476 2018-05-08 18:06:04 How long until trump invades Iran in order to “take the oil”? The guy seems to be a fan of war crimes, after all.
5477 2018-05-08 18:06:03 Further instability in the Middle East will drive up oil prices and revitalize Russia’s economy.  In other words, “Mission Accomplished”.  Trump has kept yet another campaign promise - to Putin.

5479 2018-05-08 18:05:58 @Clack_Sam excellent stuff. I'm going to put oil on our bird feeder tomorrow. Will post a vid if successful.
5480 2018-05-08 18:05:49 Trumps oil and gas buddies want the price of oil to go sky high so they can make a shitload of money and it all be tax-free. That’s why he is pulling out of Iran deal
5481 2018-05-08 18:05:40 If history has taught us anything, its that all hell breaks loose whenever there is a surge in oil prices. Polarizing Iran today will only make it STRONGER.

5483 2018-05-08 18:05:33 having a fine art background is really helpful as a designer because I can produce a stronger argument of why a certain color should be used based on color theory and the elements & principles of art.

yet another way oil painting has helped me in the digital environment.
5484 2018-05-08 18:05:30 So, you’re getting all the money back, right? Otherwise, it’s an insult to us all, to get nothing for the millions we gave. Way to back door higher oil prices.
5485 2018-05-08 18:05:26 Lots of reasons for Trump to stick with Iran deal ( low oil prices, no plan B, risk of military conflict,slap in face of US allies) Convincing N Korea to denuclearize which they've no intention of doing, isn't one of them
5486 2018-05-08 18:05:18 The DNC: “Those crafty Republicans just want cheap oil!”
5487 2018-05-08 18:05:08 yeah i’ve seen a few people say this, there’s this primer oil that goes with it, maybe it works a bit better if you use this or a different oil?
5488 2018-05-08 18:05:08 In the longer run, major trade and financial powers will increasingly shift out of the dollar towards the RMB transactions. Think about the long-term implications of the Chinese opening new oil trading market. Beginning of oil trade shift toward RMB long-term.

5501 2018-05-08 18:03:48 If @realDonaldTrump decides to pull out of the nuclear deal, there will be an instant 200-300mil barrel deficit in the oil market (Iran’s cut). The only country willing to make up for it will be Saudi Arabia, if & only if it jacks up prices.

5512 2018-05-08 18:02:35 Oil prices have started to fall and world markets are beginning to react in anticipation of Trump backing out of the Iranian nuclear deal #JoytvNews
5513 2018-05-08 18:02:26 should have bought oil futures a few min ago..... I have a feeling they're about to spike.
5514 2018-05-08 18:02:15 Oil prices up 20% this year. My god..how is someone as dumb as you a teacher?
5515 2018-05-08 18:02:08 If Trump brings back the Iran sanctions, this would create yet another crisis with Turkey. 

Turkey has substantial trade with Iran, gas and oil. 

Going back to pre-nuclear deal would be very problematic for Ankara

5518 2018-05-08 18:01:57 If any of you are sick, they should call for the elders of the church, and the elders should pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.  Prayer that comes from faith will heal the sick, for the Lord will restore them to health.

5526 2018-05-08 18:01:29 They could at least cover how this Iran deal talk is designed to cause oil prices to rise benefiting Russia, SA, and R donors.

Follow the money....

5529 2018-05-08 18:01:11 Under President Trump:

The United States is set to become the World’s LARGEST oil producer in 2018.

Iran and the Middle East can no longer use oil as leverage.

If you think this is a coincidence you haven’t been paying attention.

We are witnessing a genius.

5540 2018-05-08 18:00:09 Trump is blowing up the Iran deal to help Russia with much higher oil prices.
Your phony tax cuts just got erased at least 10 times over.

Question is, how long before Bibi starts a war with Iran and 45 has to join in?

But when we consider other factors like high oil price of 2013 and low exports in 2018 i.e. where weak rupee is bad.

5549 2018-05-08 17:59:46 Most of his plans to support the oil & gas industry mimic what Harper did; combing social media for "lies" to counter and making environmentalists the "enemy".
Didn't work so well for Harper and another open war from the Cons will likely animate more anti pipeline protests.

5556 2018-05-08 17:58:53 The real argument is someone wants the world price of oil to rise so they can get more money out of Europe, All the other arguments are window dressing to make this happen.
5557 2018-05-08 17:58:52 Sorry its nothing to do with you its due to oil prices which has fallen all over the world but you are busy imposing heavy fuel prices to common people.
5558 2018-05-08 17:58:50 what is squalene and how do you use those oils?! i’m at weleda cream cleanser, jojoba oil w a drop of tea tree for night time, and andalou naturals rose day cream w spf. i’ll do a honey mask every couple weeks. should i be fucking w retinols, c serums?
5559 2018-05-08 17:58:40 We haven't forgotten that it were the US and the UK who together  committed a coup in 1954 against the democratically elected PM of Iran to put the Shah in place to get grab of its oil.
5560 2018-05-08 17:58:40 Socialist Venezuela's oil output has halved in less than 2 decades to 1.5 million barrels a day after it failed to invest enough in its oil industry.  The cost of Corbyn's admired Socialist government!
5561 2018-05-08 17:58:32 @realDonaldTrump YOU ARE A GOD DAMNED IDIOT! PULLING OUT OF IRAN DEAL DOES NOTHING EXCEPT RAISE COST OF OIL, DESTABILIZE REGION, MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A LIAR TO NORTH KOREA AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY LOOK LIKE IT CAN'T BE TRUSTED!!!!

FUCKING IDIOTIC MOVE!

5568 2018-05-08 17:58:11 Not all natural resources are finite. Trees, fruits and vegetables replace themselves with seeds and become new plants. Oil is constantly being made and is being found in new places all the time.  I can go on with this. 

Resources aren't the problem. Consumption is.
5569 2018-05-08 17:58:10 So you will advocate Full Fiscal Powers , inc oil gas electricity, water , businesses , and every other taxable income generated in Scotland. All to be devolved to Holyrood instead of being robbed from us by Westmonster ?
5570 2018-05-08 17:58:10 Hard to develop new export markets when China, Brazil and EU have a tariff on us.  Oh and India won't take automotive just industrial. And hard to compete with big oil when they own pipelines, terminals and retail.
5571 2018-05-08 17:58:09 Russia exports almost 8 million barrels per day already (2nd largest exporter in the world). Threatening sanctions on Iran has driven oil up almost $30 a barrel already. This is $90B a year with no increase in Russian exports needed...

It is always about money with these people.
5572 2018-05-08 17:58:07 i was committing on his toilet seat wearing "mascot" the other day. Also looks like he's sweating black sweat. Not sure if that's motor oil or what.
5573 2018-05-08 17:58:02 Please understand...not every person working in the oil industry benefits from any of this. Yes, the companies get richer but they do not let the money trickle down to it's employees. Married for over 30  years to an oil field worker and we are barely surviving.
5574 2018-05-08 17:58:01 We will buy #Iranian oil.... Hahahha my plan is successful 10$ Iranian crude

--Instability in Middle East, war likely
--Zionists, Bibi ecstatic

5583 2018-05-08 17:57:31 Note that I didn't include or exclude any specific countries, but all the replies were about gas and oil prices rising, when that will be the least of the fallout of any impending (additional) war in the Middle East.

5593 2018-05-08 17:56:39 BREAKING: Trump administration officials informing Congress leaders that US will withdraw from Iran nuclear deal. How this decision can effect the American-iran relations and also world oil markets?
5594 2018-05-08 17:56:38 F++k you.  Have you ever heard of trying?  Trying to save the planet?  Trying to limit oil.  Trying to learn about the negative effects of fossil fuel useage.  TRYING to improve.  Are you TRYING?  Trying is better than not.  IN a generation or two it might be enough.
5595 2018-05-08 17:56:28 War with Iran, grap the oil. This is the plan.
5596 2018-05-08 17:56:24 #IranDeal was for Obama's Wall Street buddies. Trump isn't owned by Oil and Gas multinationals.
5597 2018-05-08 17:56:18 Trump is pulling out of Iran deal so the price of gasoline can be at least $4.00 a gallon. Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign - one of those had to be to the oil companies to maximize their profits, just like the two oil guys Bush/Chaney.#NoWarWithIran
5598 2018-05-08 17:56:17 Now about ur question do u know how much oil on credit india have taken from iran between 2004 to 2014 which UPA did not paid off? How much amount is dues? What is gonna happen if government will not pay that? How oil companies will survive?
5599 2018-05-08 17:56:16 2/2 This nuclear agreement was negotiated by President @BarackObama to restrict Iran’s nuclear program. President #Trump’s alternative to administering sanctions would destabilize the agreement and cause further turmoil to the oil industry.
5600 2018-05-08 17:56:14 And if the price of oil drops and Iran gives in  to the TRUMP impossed sanctions...CNBC and CNN. will credit OBAMA....HAHAHAHAHA

5609 2018-05-08 17:55:19 Worse even than helping Russia is the cost and negative impact on every single American citizen. Oil prices drive a large part of inflation and with wages flat more people are hurting and those who were hurting before are teetering on the edge of homelessness.

5612 2018-05-08 17:54:56 We used a net over our bed and cotton balls sprayed with lavender oil around the netting while in Africa.
5613 2018-05-08 17:54:52 Thank you both for that.  So it's all about oil?  And if we can't get oil from Iran, Russia will sell it to us?   Is that right?
5614 2018-05-08 17:54:46 Who wants to make a bet that trump has gone long on oil?
5615 2018-05-08 17:54:42 On a per capita basis we Canadians consume energy at more than five times the world average. We even consume more energy than oil hungry Americans and twice as much as the average citizen in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
5616 2018-05-08 17:54:41 Oil price drop today is indication insiders know he is staying in for now .
5617 2018-05-08 17:54:38 Pulling out of the Iran deal will substantially raise the price of gas and oil. Who benefits greatly from that? Putin and Russia of course.
5618 2018-05-08 17:54:30 Absolutely not, it’s time we really start moving towards alternate energy sources and away from oil! Where are your facts proving the impact to seniors??
5619 2018-05-08 17:54:30 Naw, more like Putin's orders...needs the price of oil to move up.  Enjoy the feature.  Also, vote these folks out, PLEASE.

5621 2018-05-08 17:54:26 OK so if President Trump pulls out of the Iran "deal" (GOOD !!!)
now what ?

Demand that the news and financial people
STOP THE NONSENSE !   Never mind war, the price of Oil and all the rest of the FEAR MONGERING, WAR MONGERING, Fear !!!

Just stop with the DEFEATIST CRAP.
5622 2018-05-08 17:54:22 Not really. We protect that oil because if China doesn't get their oil, they will kill for it.
5623 2018-05-08 17:54:21 I think USA /UK and France and the the ones who responsible for the chaos in the middle East in the first place. Iraq, Libya Syria and Yemen are rubbles now. No freedom has come to the dead or the living. Only coperate businesses and oil companies in Western countries gained!
5624 2018-05-08 17:54:20 $USD lower, energy higher, also fits my Oil narrative.

5626 2018-05-08 17:54:10 Bit hypocritical, we are destroying the US hinterland to get INEOS/PetroChina shale gas into Grangemouth. We must stop the importation of shale oil as well
5627 2018-05-08 17:54:05 Some natural resources are finite and others are not. Some resources are not longer used due to technology. We used to use whale blubber to make oil to light the streets. We don't anymore. We are now moving away from oil to other forms of energy to power our homes and cars.

5630 2018-05-08 17:53:54 Analysts said recession in Venezuela, a major oil exporter, had kept prices high because its output was slowing.  Growth in production in the USA is counterbalanced by the simultaneous decline in Venezuela.
5631 2018-05-08 17:53:48 you have made a good point...but Dr Swamy is raising concern on weakening of our currency and obviously increase in crude oil price has a major impact on inflation and overall economy...

What part doesn't?
5635 2018-05-08 17:53:11 And skyrocketing oil prices will be just a side benefit for Putin.
5636 2018-05-08 17:53:10 Iran has shown little inclination to tamper with FON in the Straight of Hormuz (and Saudi oil can simply be diverted through pipes to the Red Sea) that even that is a debatable core interest. It truly is baffling to me, I've been pushing these arguments since my undergrad thesis.
5637 2018-05-08 17:53:08 Huh? Try turning on your spell check Jethro.
Hypocrites because look at the 'camp' Everything there is created with oil.
Why aren't they opposed to tankers on the east coast?
Every band that the pipeline crosses is on board with the project.
5638 2018-05-08 17:53:08 #harper never once worked to benefit the real working class O&G industry is as a result of his ten year leadership us a disaster NO pipeline to create work for the average worker guy oil prices collapsed during his regime “deal must benefit real people” is only a cute sound bite
5639 2018-05-08 17:52:50 @RepPeteKing what the heck is going on?  Do you care about your constituents ? This country is crumbling and you’re trying to halt the Mueller investigation.And now oil will sky rocket with trump pulling out of Iran deal? We need help in NY to stay here. You’re an embarrassment
5640 2018-05-08 17:52:49 We have a bottle of Peopermint oil on hand. You can drop it over the tick and it will make it back itself out so you don’t risk leaving the head behind.
5641 2018-05-08 17:52:45 Every time I go in @AdvanceAuto the workers assume I don’t know anything at all just because I’m a female. Just so y’all know I know how to put oil in my car.

5643 2018-05-08 17:52:23 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

5645 2018-05-08 17:52:11 How many oil paints have been victim to ppl not knowing how to use them
5646 2018-05-08 17:51:50 Exactly, leave it to real socialists to allow oil exploration and processing companies to dominate their economy for two decades. No nuance here, just cut and dry socialism ruining lives.
5647 2018-05-08 17:51:48 @realDonaldTrump  pulling us out of the Iran Agreement is f$%!ing moronic. YOU ACTUALLY ARE  a fu#^ing idiot. One outcome will be to screw the middle class with higher gas prices which is from oil prices rising. THANK YOU A-HOLE
5648 2018-05-08 17:51:45 Castor oil and vitamin E oil
5649 2018-05-08 17:51:42 Feeling scammed and bamboozled every time I buy olive oil or honey at the supermarket. Would be nice if every product were accompanied by a video that shows its life from plant/animal to shelved bottle...
5650 2018-05-08 17:51:41 Oil scalpers have had quite the day already...
5651 2018-05-08 17:51:27 Fill your cars up, the price of oil is going to go up quick. Great for Trump’s oil friends, not so for us. Next we’ll hear them push for more domestic oil drilling. It’s all about the money.
5652 2018-05-08 17:51:22 why am i such an absolute unit. im not calling myself fat but i am calling myself a cylindrical ass bitch. why do my legs have to be so fucking meaty? ontop of that ive got a torso like a damn oil drum smh

5654 2018-05-08 17:51:09 The conservatives always look to health care and the public sector as the first place to cut as if those jobs are less important. It's like they think we'll all stay healthy while they balance their budgets and fail to plan for a future that's no dependent on one commodity: oil.
5655 2018-05-08 17:51:08 Grease, still not understanding? Animal fat/grease, engine oil/grease?
5656 2018-05-08 17:50:59 im no economist but wouldn't an expected oil shortage drive prices up?

5661 2018-05-08 17:50:44 Best to End the deal as they have only lied - hidden agenda - death to America - terrible especially after we gave them cargo planes full of cash which America could have used for the wall / military shameful - need a refund or take their oil as a refund.
5662 2018-05-08 17:50:41 And why should we have let oil and natural resources in the hands of a genocidal and evil dictator?
5663 2018-05-08 17:50:41 At oil changers they taking years I'm just ready to go get dressed
5664 2018-05-08 17:50:35 Oh yay, oil prices are going up. #IranDeal
5665 2018-05-08 17:50:26 Breaking Iran deal makes no sense whatsoever, except to Putin, who benefits enormously from higher oil prices.
5666 2018-05-08 17:50:26 ...but hitting the jackpot with big oil.
5667 2018-05-08 17:50:24 @realDonaldTrump 
Iran has arguably the world's largest proven oil and gas reserves.   
Access to this resource is important for the world. 
We cannot allow them to develop a nuclear weapon, as they are very likely to use them to further threaten the Arab world, Europe, and USA
5668 2018-05-08 17:50:16 I came a few weeks ago to get my oil change @GalpinHonda and I’m here again because they can’t screw anything right and my bumper has been scrapping all week and this happened twice already I shouldn’t  even be here waiting an hour for their screw up once again – bij Galpin Honda
5669 2018-05-08 17:50:11 Oil prices plunge ahead of Trump's Iran decision
5670 2018-05-08 17:50:11 I wish y’all would learn about cars so y’all can stop crying when ya shit fucked up because you ignored the oil change light!
5671 2018-05-08 17:50:07 Thank goodness most people disagree. Billionaire bankers and oil companies would be dancing in their boardrooms

5679 2018-05-08 17:49:43 Einstein - OIL MARKETS ARE TIGHTENING meaning they expect a shortage when iran sanctions return
5680 2018-05-08 17:49:41 Tonights spiced (oil baked) sweet potato wedges with veggies and white fish was an all round success - feeling very pleased right now after such a stressful day.
5681 2018-05-08 17:49:36 They have the largest oil reserves in the world, Socialism means they are only the sixth largest producer.
5682 2018-05-08 17:49:27 If he doesn't create a war, he's determined to make us suffer from an economic disaster. Look at oil prices right now.. Watch how they clime now. There goes a those cuts. Little ol me, didn't even see an increase so, I'm going to lose more money 
5683 2018-05-08 17:49:22 And the federal Gov't should PUSH the Eastern line through.  Or put a tax on importing of oil.
5684 2018-05-08 17:49:20 Does it really matter? UK, Germany, France and the rest of the world will continue to support the deal and will continue to buy oil and trade with Iran. The world is bigger than the US and the world no longer cares what Trump's US says or does
5685 2018-05-08 17:49:19 Like free oil changes 
5686 2018-05-08 17:49:19 He probably had the worst job in the world... Corruption, destruction, isis, more corruption, low oil prices. I dont envy Abadi at all but what he achieved is remarkable. I think he should win the Noble Peace Prize
5687 2018-05-08 17:49:17 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5688 2018-05-08 17:49:16 A joint collaboration effort between Trump, Saudi Arabia and Oil Companies!
5689 2018-05-08 17:49:14 So I got a oil change yesterday I keep driving around smelling burnt oil I lift  the damn hood up and oil cap is fucking missing 
5690 2018-05-08 17:49:13 Sprinkle some lavender oil on her
5691 2018-05-08 17:49:13 Putin wants one thing more than anything else and that is the price of oil to go up. So how is tRump behaving? Accordingly.
5692 2018-05-08 17:49:08 Swap out a few words and see if your opinion changes for the same behaviour in a different location.  RMTs are HCPs, so let's go with...

"Jacks off in dentist's chair"
"Jacks off in ER waiting area"
"Jacks off during annual check up"

What about
"Jack's off during oil change"?
5693 2018-05-08 17:49:04 why did they die?  of course for oil 
5694 2018-05-08 17:49:02 If I was Iran I would have scuttled some oil tankers in an important strait years ago. "If we can't buy stuff, nobody can buy stuff." It's not hard.
5695 2018-05-08 17:48:59 I Never Believed Nigeria Was That Hard..Until i Saw a guy Eating Bread With "Anointing Oil" This Hot  afternoon
5696 2018-05-08 17:48:57 When oil is cheaper than it was years ago yet gas prices are twice as high! Something seriously wrong here.
5697 2018-05-08 17:48:57 In my experience it wasn't a fridge.
More likely a few cannabis farms bypassing the electrics and maybe a few drums off cannabis oil.
5698 2018-05-08 17:48:52 Trump is not going to let them get a nuke. And the US is upping its production of oil and gas, selling to EU to undercut Putin. 

He is no friend of Putin. But carry on, it’s entertaining!
5699 2018-05-08 17:48:43 I think all oil exporters have scored tonight including Iran. 
the question is:  will the EU stay in the deal or exit?.
5700 2018-05-08 17:48:43 Btw you might want to clean the pieces with dishwashing soap to remove the oil from the pieces then sand it so the paint will stick better ^^
5701 2018-05-08 17:48:40 Anything that ratchets up uncertainty in the ME and spikes oil prices is okay with the Donald, and his handler, Vlad.
5702 2018-05-08 17:48:40 Nutiva Organic hemp oil is cold expeller pressed without use of chemicals, preservatives or additives from whole, raw hemp seed. It is not a cannabis extract; but rather a vegetable oil pressed from the seed. For this reason, hemp oil & hemp foods are not a source of CBD or THC.
5703 2018-05-08 17:48:36 Very true. Oil is fungible.
5704 2018-05-08 17:48:30 Right?? Oil prices will boom!!
5705 2018-05-08 17:48:28 How long before Trumpers blame the rising oil costs from the #IranDeal on Obama and Hillary? 

I give it a week.
5706 2018-05-08 17:48:26 You might read and watch the oil analysts they all apparently disagree with you.
5707 2018-05-08 17:48:25 The only bang he'll hear is that of electorate  slamming shut the door in his face next time around. People are starting to wake up to Corbyns six form politics of protest and realise he's a seller of political snake oil.

5709 2018-05-08 17:48:18 City & Finance. Price of oil soars to highest in 4 years thanks to Venezuela's economic crisis. Corbyn's socialist friends bring Venezuela to its knees, and the world pays the price!

5713 2018-05-08 17:47:58 Yes they are...but depends. Tech boiz who own their businesses will dwarf oil boys money in Lagos
5714 2018-05-08 17:47:52 @BarclaysUKHelp  -  why are you funding Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline project.  It transport the dirtiest, most destructive from of oil.  Tar Sands.  You are directly responsible for environmental destruction. (thought i may get an answer through your customer helpline)
5715 2018-05-08 17:47:47 It's noted that when oil price was at 114 dollars a barrel the GEJ administration didn't build Lagos-Ibadan expressway, they ate the money and they want to come back. To do what abeg? All these looters, there's God ooo. @APCUKingdom @OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg@Harrisdoug

5719 2018-05-08 17:47:30 As Trump's decision on #Iran approaches, a good time to follow the always terrific @catkngai, who has just joined our #oil team in New York  #OOTT
5720 2018-05-08 17:47:29 On a per capita basis we in Canada consume energy at more than five times the world average. We even consume more energy than oil hungry Americans and twice as much as the average citizen in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
5721 2018-05-08 17:47:19 Cheaper oil prices? Leverage over Iran? Control of inspections? European allies?
5722 2018-05-08 17:47:19 NOW: @HPMZinn talks with composer Ellen Reid and librettist Sarah LaBrie about their upcoming premiere by @LAMasterChorale, featuring a piece partially inspired by #Houston and the #oil industry.
5723 2018-05-08 17:47:18 Yes Iran, Russia and China, want to run the Middle East. Trump is right, it’s about oil and gas....The EU/Britain wants to keep in Iran deal due to the above. It’s going to come down to US or Russia, China and Iran. Hope we go with US are best Allies!
5724 2018-05-08 17:47:16 Oil prices have already increased! The cost of food has been steadily increasing as well. We're being robbed right before our eyes and no one is doing anything about it. It hasn't been mentioned or addressed by anyone. How do we stop this? Is it just me?
5725 2018-05-08 17:47:11 Trump pulling out of Iran deal will make oil prices go up. Count on it. Grocery prices already going up. @Tennessean @ChriswithaTIAN @JumboHart @Fred_Kirsch @maddow
5726 2018-05-08 17:47:10 I hear Trump wants to buy Russian oil....who would've figured that!
5727 2018-05-08 17:47:00 Fascinating take. He did run his mouth about his oil prices last week. You are correct if he ignores the next wave up to, say, $80. His blue collar base would like the inevitable attacks on OPEC and the call to drill more in the U.S.
5728 2018-05-08 17:46:56 Everything they said about coconut oil....IS TRUE
5729 2018-05-08 17:46:56 Standard oil was cheap too.
How many small and large bussines have to go under while Amazon expanding. The only thing that keeps prices down is competition. Monopolies are harmful for the free market.
5730 2018-05-08 17:46:55 At last. We are back on top and in a position to control of oil production and sale around the world and making us oil independent.
5731 2018-05-08 17:46:52 I work at a ford dealer, I have not found one valvoline oil filter that I didn't have to use a huge channel locks to remove,  everyone severely overtorqued.
5732 2018-05-08 17:46:47 @Vscrt001  I have not seen any links on how to purchase some of your oil. Are you to that point of distribution?

5735 2018-05-08 17:46:42 Not entirely true. He is great at boosting fossil fuel and oil prices. In which rival country, run by a dictator, does oil makes up 70% of their GDP?

Russia of course! This is great for Putin.

5740 2018-05-08 17:46:26 Pulling out of the Iran deal is about 2 things:

1: Oil prices skyrocketing (as they absolutely will) helps the GOP donor class and Russia (and harms the average American). 

2: Obama did it to protect America, so it has to be destroyed.
5741 2018-05-08 17:46:23 Higher oil prices for the oil barons!!!
5742 2018-05-08 17:46:16 The problem is that Chiarelli will be in “preserve his job mode”.  He knows if the Oil don’t greatly improve this season he will be fired.  So no way is Chiarelli thinking beyond next season
5743 2018-05-08 17:46:16 I’m happy lol. Oil will go through the roof!!!!

5746 2018-05-08 17:45:53 he's adding sanctions to Iran, who's backed by Russia, who's on sanctions and on sanctions has been dealing business, oil guns & sh.t, with Iran
5747 2018-05-08 17:45:46 Price of oil will go up and that makes a lot of investors happy.
5748 2018-05-08 17:45:40 If Trump scraps Iran deal, oil prices go up so Saudi & Russia benefit. 

China, the biggest importer of Iran's oil, can still buy it using a bank already under US sanctions. 

Israel will be pleased.

EU suffers but can take comfort from their 'special relationship' with US.....
5749 2018-05-08 17:45:39 The way my legs look with baby oil on them>>>>>>>>
5750 2018-05-08 17:45:38 Trump and his cronies need oil to be $75-$100+ per barrel. It's the only way they can profit off their filthy pipelines. Thus, they must always pick fights with Iran. Good job Maggots. Hope your $15 tax cuts cover the price of gas for your pickups. #MAGA #cnn #msnbc #IranDeal

5752 2018-05-08 17:45:28 This is meaningless legislation and has been since 2015. It's STILL illegal to grow it.  Illegal to buy it.  Illegal to bring it into the state. You may possess less than 20 ounces of low-THC (less than 5 percent) cannabis oil. But there's no legal way to access it.

5759 2018-05-08 17:45:02 Be sure & tell us your oil analysis
5760 2018-05-08 17:45:02 Yes, it has. Gave u how it has been just based on current evts! If there’s 1 lie, it’s all lies-bc it proves it wasn’t fact-chkd. So 1 more: Carter Page meeting & promise of lifting sanctions for 19% of Russian oil. Page went on TV-said meeting was 30 secs & exch of pleasantries!
5761 2018-05-08 17:44:52 Gas/oil eating up wages like the last recession
5762 2018-05-08 17:44:52 Trump taking advantage of OPEC dependence on Oil,they have put production cuts to maintain the price.
Trump creates uncertainties around the world  to keep the oil price artificially high there by even after high oil production and inventory by US shale,the price remains high.
5763 2018-05-08 17:44:52 Nx deal and oil process increase due to tension on the Strait of Hormuz. China is going to hate oil prices going up. They really need their economy to be stable right now.
5764 2018-05-08 17:44:47 Less than 10% of the oil we extract globally is used in manufacturing.

The rest is fuel.
They aren't trying to close the existing pipeline, they're saying "Don't do more"

How is this hard to understand?
5765 2018-05-08 17:44:47 Pam. Her daddy does oil and all that that implies.

5767 2018-05-08 17:44:45 Frankly it is nauseating to see illiterate Muslims going to Dubai and then coming back with money which our top grade Engineers will envy. Just because Gulf Nations did some gestures means nothing. Without oil wealth Islam would have had no soft power in modern world.
5768 2018-05-08 17:44:34 Have you tried wild growth oil?
5769 2018-05-08 17:44:30 Trump's pulling out of the deal. There goes oil prices and the start of a nuclear arms race in the volatile Middle East, amature hour. Dems have just locked up House and Senate majorities today. Bless you Donnie.

He’s in fact using #Putin as template!

5776 2018-05-08 17:44:05 @Thom_Hartmann Saddam Hussein ignored OPEC .  Carlyle (BushCo) invaded Iraq to block the pipe lines, burn the oil fields and regain control of the price of Saudi Arabian and Russian oil to bankrupt America and the world to make our conquest of Life effortless.
5777 2018-05-08 17:44:02 Trump's leadership is going to leave the US and Israel against the rest of the world.  Even the Sadis are moving away from US policies and leaning towards direct oil sales with China using Chinese currency.  #ThinkForYourself

5781 2018-05-08 17:43:35 You, concerned citizen: I worry that withdrawing from the Iran deal undermines US foreign policy and indicates an abrogation of international leadership and trustworthiness. 
Me, Houstonian: Oh boy, higher oil prices! 
5782 2018-05-08 17:43:25 The destabilization this causes in the Middle East will effect global oil prices. Higher crude oil prices benefit Russia.
5783 2018-05-08 17:43:22 Indeed. Something that (as far as I can discern) cannot happen without sanctions. Deal or no deal, the oil factor is just too strong. It creates economic stability, funds internal security against opposition groups and makes the EU dependent. It's a real pickle.

There was a Shaw and his people overthru his regime because they didn't like the oil mogels from the US running the place. We don't need to change the politics in Iran because Exxon wants the oilfield. Peace
5792 2018-05-08 17:42:56 Here is a President wired to undo everything his predecessor accomplished as an international success.

Iran is a country with formidable civilisational strengths; Americans do not seem to factor this in contemporary politics. 

Expect surge in oil prices and Putin smiling away!
5793 2018-05-08 17:42:54 Kill the deal and oil prices go up helping oil companies make money and those of us with oil option investments.
5794 2018-05-08 17:42:51 Do not carry heavy overnight positions as there can be gap up or gap down in Crude oil tomorrow due to U.S. decision on Iran deal.
5795 2018-05-08 17:42:48 Honestly I haven’t gotten an oil change in so long I’m surprised I haven’t blown up

5798 2018-05-08 17:42:43 I disagree. I think it is about Russia wanting the sanctions re+imposed on Iranian oil, so Russia can dominate the oil market at a higher price.

The deal is being torn up on Russia’s command.
5799 2018-05-08 17:42:37 I like leaving kisses! It is Israel that is the problem. Those country`s that feel they can hypocritically police the world but not follow the same rules that they try to impose..... this is why so many country`s are turning their back on the $US for oil purchasing!

5803 2018-05-08 17:42:19 The US has enough oil reserves that we don’t need Middle East oil. After all the US is second in oil exports
5804 2018-05-08 17:42:17 No, just expect the price of gas to sky rocket and oil to heat our homes unaffordable.
5805 2018-05-08 17:42:14 According to Mr Trump we are more energy independent now. And if we were never buying oil from Iran. Seems this shouldn’t impact our gas prices. If it does- then it’s just more prove that those prices are rigged.

5809 2018-05-08 17:42:01 @robreiner The person with the most to gain from the US exiting the Iran deal is Vladimir Putin. His relationship with Assad & oil interests in the arctic just became gold mines. DT will argue we have to remove sanctions against Russia to lower oil prices. #IranDeal
5810 2018-05-08 17:41:58 All I wanted was an oil change and Walmart couldn’t even do that for me when nobody else was in line. Cool. I’ll just do it myself then. 
5811 2018-05-08 17:41:57 That’s been a fact for a long time. This only benefits Russia, China, DPRK, Iran, Russian & SA oil prices, & arms dealers

5814 2018-05-08 17:41:35 Nah, only thing I’ll be screaming about is gas & oil price that are sky rocketing as I type.
5815 2018-05-08 17:41:34 Pinpricks? Shells? What is this blasted faff? PAN OIL EGG CRACK SCOFF
5816 2018-05-08 17:41:34 Think of oil prices skyrocketing, which Putin craves to rescue his tanked economy. There’s the answer.
5817 2018-05-08 17:41:31 The Brits had no plan. 
Once they discovered oil in Iran,  they had no more interest in India's spices and troubles.
5818 2018-05-08 17:41:25 Lunatic at the White House continuing to wreak havoc in the Middle East all the time while oil surpluses get used up.
5819 2018-05-08 17:41:18 Did you see that the US is producing 10 million gallons of oil a day now? and that oil hit $70 a barrel, the first time since 2014? it's almost like a major economy woke back up and went back to work or something.
5820 2018-05-08 17:41:16 I'm hopeful the price of oil goes up, that is good news for my local embittered economy.
5821 2018-05-08 17:41:07 Another remove anything Obama did. Why when Iran complying? Soon oil shortages and trumps fossil fuel friends gain. Give peace a chance.
5822 2018-05-08 17:41:03 Being a scientist, to figure out what I'm dealing with, I shook the table! . I think about 5 of them.  I put some peppermint oil near the holes and so far, they quit going in and out.
5823 2018-05-08 17:40:58 Next stop war with Iran and steal the oil. That what Bolton came aboard for
5824 2018-05-08 17:40:57 I've read that braking this deal will bring oil prices really up, and that what Putin wants. Plus, some friends make money on sanctions.
5825 2018-05-08 17:40:55 Just threatening that the USA will default on the Iran deal has driven oil up almost $30 per barrel. 

That is a ~$90BILLION a YEAR gift to Putin and the Oligarchs.
5826 2018-05-08 17:40:55 So Spanky ended Iran deal which will bring back sanctions-US will not buy Iranian oil. Oil will then go up, gas will go up, people will bitch & moan & then it will be worth it(to bankers, car, & oil people) to drill our coasts for oil. #NoLie
5827 2018-05-08 17:40:33 Everything is meant to distract from the real goals of profiting from oil for Trump mob & Putin mob.

The Iran sanctions get rid of an oil competitor & drive up barrel prices.

Venezuela already sanctioned.

Tariffs on solar.

Subsidies to oil.

EPA deregs = more oil use ...
5828 2018-05-08 17:40:31 I like chickpeas. Fresh coriander and garlic mashed to your chosen density with olive oil and a tiny amount of white wine vinegar is an easy and rewarding accompaniment to all sorts of things.
5829 2018-05-08 17:40:31 Sorry that you think that “four tours” means patriotism when his “four tours” involved killing innocent civilians. The Iraq invasion was a war for oil and Chris Kyle killed because he was as a psychopath.

5831 2018-05-08 17:40:28 I don't think Middle East countries are being "raped", they are actually enjoying vast profits, also there is just as much oil yet to be drilled just off the Falkland Islands, so no shortage, plenty of time to sort out the battery problem for EV's
5832 2018-05-08 17:40:27 He has to wait 180 days before targeting banks of nations that fail to cut their purchases of Iranian oil.

So could not impose all even if wanted to.

5837 2018-05-08 17:40:07 United States government pays oil companies to do research even as they make record-breaking profits. United States also doesn't charge rent or lease on the land that they use. And remember we're one of largest oil producers, we have reserves, & exporting oil. But our costs 
5838 2018-05-08 17:40:07 Fill up your tank! Thanks to that idiot #Trump & his warmongering  against the tolerable Iran deal, WTI oil prices have risen to over $70 - the highest in 4 years. As #Trump gets loonier, prices are likely to rise further!
5839 2018-05-08 17:40:03 Lets not forget the Saudis like Donald Trump, hate Syria and Iran, and the Houthis, Hezzbollah, and Hamas, and just told Palestinians to either come to the peace table with Israel or shut up and stop whining. If we need cheaper oil they control OPEC and prices will come down.
5840 2018-05-08 17:40:03 Interestingly, even with high oil prices and the threat of the demise of the Iran agreement, oil stocks are down.
5841 2018-05-08 17:40:02 Holy hell. What a coward. Just an absolute puppet to so many bad actors. Putin gets oil, Bolton et. al. maybe get war... this can't be good.

5844 2018-05-08 17:39:59 Obama brought peace and oil prices went down. Russia can't stand for this as it needs high oil prices. Guess what marching orders tRump has from Putin? We are seeing it in action with the resulting prices going up. 62 million people fleeced, good times huh?
5845 2018-05-08 17:39:58 Oil is ~20% Iran's $350b GDP
5846 2018-05-08 17:39:57 Oil hit its low 2 years ago..it’s been rising ever since
5847 2018-05-08 17:39:57 If Trump bails on the Iran deal he not only further destabilizes the ME, possibly invoking war, raising oil prices, separating us from allies etc. Just as with NAFTA, climate accord, TPP- we are no longer true to our word. U.S. is now about as trustworthy as North Korea. Shameful

5852 2018-05-08 17:39:46 That’s the whole point of pulling out. Big Oil has been planning to steal the Caspian Sea oil fields for 50 years and they gotta go through Iran and Russia to get it. Where is the US antiwar movement now? Still fixated on anti-Trumpism rather than anti-imperialism.
5853 2018-05-08 17:39:45 Exactly what sanctions can we impose on Iran if we are the only country that backs out of the deal? I didn't think that Iran did much business with us to begin with. Just wondering? We do not buy Iranian oil. "Iran Nuclear Deal"
5854 2018-05-08 17:39:43 I disagree it is their duty to support. If you think it is wrong, don’t support it. You can place robots there if the leaders can just push a button and all fit in lock step. That’s a reason Democrats can’t get things done when in control. Too many factions within the party.

5857 2018-05-08 17:39:30 Shredding the Iran Nuclear Treaty will cause further destabilization in the Middle East which will result in skyrocketing oil prices.
Immediate effect: It just became more expensive to travel.
5858 2018-05-08 17:39:30 If it's true that Trump received shares in Rosneft for betraying America he will personally profit as will big oil. This will benefit them for years to come. Trump doesn't care about America or its future. #Traitor #PutinsPuppet #Mobster

5872 2018-05-08 17:37:59 No one can figure out why @realDonaldTrump would pull out of the deal. .....Middle East instability will raise oil prices. Russia has an oil based economy and wants oil to rise.

5874 2018-05-08 17:37:41 I remember when @nytimes published an article in 2011 citing a so-called geologist claiming that Shale was a myth and that oil companies were exaggerating the “productivity of their wells and the size of their reserves”....
5875 2018-05-08 17:37:40 Has anyone seen the FULL process of turning alleged million-year-old oil into fuel for your car? Have you seen it pumped from the ground, then transformed into gasoline? If so, please send link to check it out. No Discovery Channel/CGI bullshit pls. I'm talking real footage here.

5879 2018-05-08 17:37:32 "Imposing sanctions on Iran is really just a way to drive up oil futures. It's what happens when your cabinet is full of bankers and oil executives. This isn't about Iran or nukes. It's about profit." <- That & a nuke by Christmas, so @POTUS can start a war by the New Years #MAGA

5883 2018-05-08 17:37:18 It would be disasterous for us. If they wanna kill each other, I don't really care, just leave us out of it. Better yet, let us capitalize on the destruction by drilling more oil.
5884 2018-05-08 17:37:17 100% of Russian oil oligarchs favor withdrawal and imposition of the sanctions on Iran's sale of oil, cutting global supply and increasing the price and thus their profits.
5885 2018-05-08 17:37:16 This article is 5 years old. Canadian oil companies continue to use the latest technology to prevent, detect and clean up spills. Enough is enough of you twisting irrelevant information to make the canadian oil industry look bad.

5888 2018-05-08 17:37:14 Yup Vlad wins again when oil prices skyrocket. And now the U.S. will succeed in not only turning the Sunni Muslim world against it (Iraq), but now the Shiite one as well. He's going to get many of us killed.
5889 2018-05-08 17:37:09 the place i get my oil changed at in Murfreesboro gives me 10 dollars off every time if i bring Benz for them to play with  
5890 2018-05-08 17:36:56 Don’t kid yourself. He’s being led by Putin counting his money as oil prices rise.
5891 2018-05-08 17:36:48 Meanwhile you live in a country that goes around the world bombing civilians in other countries on a whim. Rather conveniently those countries often have oil reserves or other resources the US is keen on... You should be ashamed!
5892 2018-05-08 17:36:43 Yes this administration sells American land to oil companies & lets climate change destroy us for profit, they are the biggest national security risk we have ever had. Nothing will be done about it why? Because dump people voted?

5894 2018-05-08 17:36:38 Guy 1: Hey bro we gotta pull over. The cars low on oil. 
Guy 2: Good idea. Better put some coolant in it. Low oil causes friction and extra heat and might seize the motor.
Guy 1: Ya. It’s too bad putting more oil in it oppresses the motor or we could just solve the problem.
5895 2018-05-08 17:36:37 How to destroy democracy and enrich your boss:

Step 1: pull out of Iran nuke deal
Step 2: Fire Mueller
Step 3: Iran War
Step 4: Rosneft oil price skyrockets

Trump feels safer with Mueller gone and hopes war is enough to distract public, Putin gets richer.
5896 2018-05-08 17:36:35 Iranian oil will be compensated. Sunni Arabs would not possibly be happier.
5897 2018-05-08 17:36:34 Amazon is a monopoly just like standard oil and AT&T was..... and  they were broken up. Amazon should be broken up as well.
5898 2018-05-08 17:36:32 You forgot, it will help Putins oil industry!
5899 2018-05-08 17:36:29 It's like both deepika and priyanka bought one bottle of coconut oil.. and said.. hojae champi.. 
5900 2018-05-08 17:36:29 When I blink I can smell Jamaican black caster oil , I smell good
5901 2018-05-08 17:36:26 and all to keep a few industries fat and happy

Security-Military-OIL
5902 2018-05-08 17:36:26 Keepin this! Tryin to add only natural things from zero. Currently on cold water and black seed oil. Obviously room to grow
5903 2018-05-08 17:36:19 This boy has me all distracted I almost used oil to make bacon wrapped hotdogs 
5904 2018-05-08 17:36:19 I started using the ogx argan oil brand of dry shampoo and it actually keeps my hair looking presentable for a couple days from one spray, better than any I've tried so far
5905 2018-05-08 17:36:11 I wonder if somebody named Rex Tillerson would gain from oil prices increasing, along wigh everyone else who has a whitehouse seat.
5906 2018-05-08 17:36:09 Since 1953 Iranians lived under a tyrannical ruler who was only there because the US overthrew the guy who didn't care for outside govts taking oil from them and not compensating fairly
5907 2018-05-08 17:36:04 Retweeted John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang):

Trump confirms Putin's plan to pull out of #IranDeal

Cue oil prices rising and Vlad chuckling softly.
5908 2018-05-08 17:35:52 Oh, but the price of a barrel of oil will go up enough for profits & moving forward with the Rosneft pipeline AND Mogilevich has some nuclear material he wants to sell to Russia's buddy, Iran.  So it's all good! <sarcasm>

Russian mob is playing military games now.
5909 2018-05-08 17:35:42 Breaking, the price of oil is plunging, you don’t have a clue what you are talking about.
5910 2018-05-08 17:35:37 Id try folex to clean it! Ive used it on motor oil on my suit and it came off.
5911 2018-05-08 17:35:36 Castor oil bath is highly rejuvenating.
5912 2018-05-08 17:35:35 @realDonald This could be a further boost on gas prices if Iran Oil is excluded from world market
5913 2018-05-08 17:35:34 Crude oil falls ...California will hike prices more
5914 2018-05-08 17:35:22 A4: Pan seared scalloped with pea pura 
Just blend peas in the blender and sear the scallops with butter and oil
5915 2018-05-08 17:35:21 Conventional wisdom says that shit canning the Iran nuclear deal is likely to cause soaring oil prices. Guess what Russia’s number one export is? A sanctions workaround? #IranNukeDeal
5916 2018-05-08 17:35:18 always follow the money....
what happens to the price of oil if sanctions are imposed and which companies and countries stand to benefit the most?
5917 2018-05-08 17:35:18 Trump is bending over backwards to knock Kim out of contention so he can sell war with Iran to American public. N.K. has NO oil, wealth, strategic value
POTUS is a bidniz man operating U.S. policy as his bidniz
5918 2018-05-08 17:35:12 Let’s see how the spike in oil prices caused by our Iran decision helps Putin by 2024.
5919 2018-05-08 17:34:56 How about oil and vinegar?
5920 2018-05-08 17:34:51 Good news for Canada. Oil prices will go through the roof!!! I’d bet over $100 a barrel or more. Our economy will boom. Unfortunately for you, the US dollar will tank and you’ll have no allies
5921 2018-05-08 17:34:51 The point of this tweet is not to say whether or not it okay to party. The point is Pakistan claims to be "Islam ka qila" and Pakistanis love to install Islamic regimes in other countries but here at home this is what they are doing.
5922 2018-05-08 17:34:50 Oil company profits will increase from $100,000,000/day to $125,000,000/day.
5923 2018-05-08 17:34:46 Gas Prices, Oil Prices will sky rocket...
5924 2018-05-08 17:34:42 Cuz coconut oil is a beautiful thing
5925 2018-05-08 17:34:42 Just sitting here waiting on an oil change, and The Pioneer Woman is on TV. Why is this show so bad?  #cringe
5926 2018-05-08 17:34:40 Weren’t they involved in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and etc before the agreement?  The issue now is what happens next? Consequences.  Do we bail out and simply not reinstate be full sanctions; or not enforce.  Do we hit oil only? In their a strategy here?
5927 2018-05-08 17:34:36 Have you ever tried Peppermint essential oil for headaches? It really helps me.
5928 2018-05-08 17:34:35 #MomKnowsTheBest 

My mom believes in natural beauty. She always tell me to use natural products that makes skin glowing for years & years. She suggests me to drink lot of water. For glowing face, scrub with "malaai" & for glowing skin use "besan, haldi, coconut oil" mixed paste.
5929 2018-05-08 17:34:28 Not going to say war or increased global oil prices and subsequent inflation, don't know enough to say that.
5930 2018-05-08 17:34:27 Simple-personally, do you invest all your money in oil stocks? Assuming “no” because that would be high risk.  That is what our economy is-high risk, volatile.  Like a good portfolio-we need diversification-it’s really that simple. #ableg #LakeOfFireParty #ABPoli #neverkenney
5931 2018-05-08 17:34:26 It’s a crude oil scalping kind of day.
5932 2018-05-08 17:34:25 You still have to rape a Middle Eastern country to get oil, transport it halfway around the world using "sump oil" powered ships, spend a fortune refining it, wasting electricity that could be used for motive power & deliver it by lorry to the local fuel dump. Or frack.
5933 2018-05-08 17:34:24 OIL  86$ 
في حالة خروج ترامب من الاتفاق النووي الإيراني 

يا كريم
5934 2018-05-08 17:34:20 And Russia will get rich. Their now irrelevant economy based on oil will bounce back immediately, then the unavoidable conflict between Iran and Israel will destabilise the whole region even more, making Russia the only stable large oil exporter for 3 continents.
5935 2018-05-08 17:34:19 Oil prices and Ca's CAFE standaeds took away the middle classes luxury cars like the big Buicks and Crown Vics. SUVs was what were left. My Tahoe is 16 yrs old and still going great. I plan to keep till it's at least 20.

5938 2018-05-08 17:34:10 Want to know how we get inflation higher than expected? Higher oil prices.
5939 2018-05-08 17:34:10 I’m glad the oil & gas commission meets only 4 times/yr. we’re already in the weeds @NCPolicyWatch #ncpol
5940 2018-05-08 17:34:10 At this point in time rising tension on some key regions will raise oil prices, Any economy based on this commodity will profit from it. Especially one in high déficit like Russia
5941 2018-05-08 17:34:01 They already had them . However he helped make them the number 1 oil producer in the Middle East.  And a lot of money went to terror outlets . I seriously doubt if this Iran deal slowed down there center fuze manufacturing.
5942 2018-05-08 17:33:59 He is a disgraceful human, he cares for nothing but money, he would let the entire world die if he could have everything. He is selling American land to oil companies, & letting climate change destroy us for profit. He’s the biggest national security risk we have ever had.
5943 2018-05-08 17:33:54 Hey #TRUMP lovers,First place you will see your lord's Iran withdraw results-At the pump!!!! & wouldn't ya know who benefits most from higher oil prices in this situation? yep #Rusher .
5944 2018-05-08 17:33:53 Ironically, the nation that w/benefit most from US pulling out of Iran deal is China.  Cheaper oil to fuel their economy and done in their local currency.  A win win.   Too Much Winning...
5945 2018-05-08 17:33:46 MeRi Ami bhi bht oil lagati thi hair's me mujhy

5946 2018-05-08 17:33:40 So you'll nix the treating, allowing Iran to enrich uranium, spiking oil prices and increasing global tensions. You're proving to be a failure at every turn.
5947 2018-05-08 17:33:20 Got some time to kill while getting an oil change. Ask me some questions about our shows coming up on 5/26 & 5/27, our exploding YouTube numbers, #Americanrana18, or anything else! #AskBeyond #AMA #QandA
5948 2018-05-08 17:33:17 Sure, they all want regional instability, higher oil prices, and to scuttle anything with North Korea.
5949 2018-05-08 17:33:06 And how is low oil prices bad ?
5950 2018-05-08 17:33:00 iba ngayon skincare ko kasi acne prone ako pag preggy. i use micellar water or cleansing oil, tapos aztec clay with apple cider vinegar, tapos facial foam. i do this 3 times a week para ma control ang acne. in between i use prosource soap and my skin pore no more :)
5951 2018-05-08 17:32:51 to buy catastrophic policy IF they could. They can't. They don't want day to day insurance, just the kind that keeps you out of bankruptcy
5952 2018-05-08 17:32:41 Trump and the GOP won't be happy until our sons and daughters lay dying on the fields of Iraq in a needless war that would only benefit big oil and war profiteers. #IranDeal
5953 2018-05-08 17:32:34 He supports big oil. The big oil that’s ripping you and all the citizens of the US off. Making billions at the expense of their customer
5954 2018-05-08 17:32:27 Oil sanctions don't work. It is a fungible commodity.  See Iraq and how well those sanctions worked out.
5955 2018-05-08 17:32:27 Two days of celebrations for Putin. This is infuriating, we are watching powerless the capitulation of US and rise of a Russian dictator. Oil will immediately rise, Israel / Iran war will then make Russia become the only large and stable oil exporter for 3 continents.
5956 2018-05-08 17:32:25 I wonder why the oil market is tanking (no pun intended) now that #Drumpf is nuking the Iran agreement. After all, oil imports from Iran will be restricted, causing a major increase in prices, and that should be fabulous news for Putin and his oil-rich oligarchs.

5957 2018-05-08 17:32:18 I just made some rockin' vinigarette. I put vinegar, canola oil, raspberries, parsley, and red pepper flakes into a blender. It's sweet, sour, and spicey! Put it on a veggie salad and BAM!
5958 2018-05-08 17:32:17 Oil #stocks have still not caught up to the increase in oil prices which creates a buying opportunity for investors. #oil sentiment has been so bad for so long that any increase in oil brings a slow increase in stock price but any oil price decrease causes a stock price plummet
5959 2018-05-08 17:32:16 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.

5961 2018-05-08 17:32:07 3/3  The more fracked wells, the gassier the sites—meaning there’s more natural gas but less & less oil for future wells.

What is the plan when USA is bankrupt & dependent on Middle East & China for what’ll be far, far-higher priced oil?
5962 2018-05-08 17:32:04 Listen. Iran was out of the deal for 4 years and the oil was trading at $30. May be the oil price will go down. US producers will pump up more oil #IranDeal $USDCAD #Oil
5963 2018-05-08 17:32:02 Govt should take stand .I know they would not but this is govt s authority .Oil is cheap in Pakistan compare to other countries
5964 2018-05-08 17:31:51 Watch oil prices...
5965 2018-05-08 17:31:46 2/3 USA is repeating same mistakes—exporting US energy to benefit Big Oil &, especially, foreign companies & govs—as our 1940s’ mistakes that led to 40-year oil embargo which Obama lifted in Jan 2016.

Oil & NG are nonrenewable resources. And fracked wells have short lives.
5966 2018-05-08 17:31:40 So when you go to get gas to put in your car b/c you can't afford an electric & shout, "WTH, $5 a gallon," it's because your moron "president" #Spanky nixed #IranDeal b/c he hates Obama and wants 1. war, 2. profits from Oil prices going up. #FreeDUMB #worldwar3countdown #IranWar

My son breaks out in an even nastier blistering rash. Goes back to the clinic and they say: stop treatment and use coconut oil. -_-

5971 2018-05-08 17:31:23 Not only that oil will go high, coal will be one competitive again and the winner is : tadaaaa Russia. Great for their economy
5972 2018-05-08 17:31:23 Thank you!! I’m nearly drowning in Castor oil every night trying to get them to grow back :( I look like a freak
5973 2018-05-08 17:31:21 Moisturizing is still really important!! Just find one suited for oily skin! Cetaphil has an oil control moisturizer and their entire skincare line is nice and isn’t too expensive. Plus they’re cruelty free! 
5974 2018-05-08 17:31:19 hes catering to the oil interests of Russia and greasin the pockets of the traitors in the Republican party who are proud to stuff their pockets and screw the nation in the process -
5975 2018-05-08 17:31:18 All those oppressed oil executives will finally get to do some more profit-taking & buy their next private islands, don't forget them! Where else will they land their new helicopter?
5976 2018-05-08 17:31:09 If the price of oil rises as predicted, *everything* will become more expensive. The US economy is entirely dependent on oil as a raw manufacturing source, fuel for raw and finished goods transportation, energy grid fuel etc.

It's going to get ugly real fast.
5977 2018-05-08 17:31:08 Higher oil prices also will benefit #Spanky’s Russian buddy Putin, whose entire economy is dependent on energy sales, both natural gas and crude.
5978 2018-05-08 17:31:07 But then this is all the math that Doug Ford ever needed...

If Douggie has $20K, and hash oil costs $20 per gram, and can be re-sold for $50 per gram, how much profit will Douggie make?
5979 2018-05-08 17:31:06 One day, I won't have to worry about it I'll be like that ain't shit change the oil in all these mf'ers 
5980 2018-05-08 17:30:55 Russia sure would benefit from a hike in oil prices
5981 2018-05-08 17:30:51 I don't like it but was stunned he prevented ANY debate on fixes from being had. I know ppl that can't afford it, but could afford
5982 2018-05-08 17:30:49 Oil is above $70, for the first time since 2014, and this is supporting the Canadian TSX stock index, which has risen to its highest level in 13 weeks. Suncor is trading near its highest level in more than a decade.
5983 2018-05-08 17:30:48 [6:28PM] @iikonacltd: from Ifako  to Anthony  is currently Bern taken over by  Rano oil tanker trucks. #TrafficChief
5984 2018-05-08 17:30:48 He wants their oil don't you remember we messed up in Iraq we didn't take their oil besides the oil companies are playing us they're going to increase their prices we're going to have to pay for it and they are going to enjoy their bonuses.
5985 2018-05-08 17:30:45 @mrvintageestate Not sure how I am being intolerant of other peoples’ opinions? Just stating that the majority of exports go to other countries so the effect on US oil prices would likely be more minimal than the 25% increase that you are suggesting.
5986 2018-05-08 17:30:44 I love how matte I've been all day! Does anyone know why I would want to moisturizer with vitamin e oil this summer? Is it comedogenic?
5987 2018-05-08 17:30:43 So it's about cooking oil, not Arab oil
5988 2018-05-08 17:30:41 the collusion/conspiracy with Russia - on going
Trump removes the sanctions on indicted Russians;
imposes old sanctions & adds new ones on Iran;
Results:
more oil revenue for Russia;
higher gas/crude prices for US & EU;
Losers - US/Iran/EU
Winner - Russia
5989 2018-05-08 17:30:39 Lot of #oil news flow as it corrects almost 2% before Trump’s announcement on #irandeal...those not wanting to play a pure crude trade..short #usdcad and short #usdnok remain a good play for higher crude prices as well as fading the recent short covering rally in #usd
5990 2018-05-08 17:30:36 Since ~2008, Big Oil promised:  USA w/be energy independent when oil production is 10 MBPD.

Big Oil reached that goal.

But USA still imports 7.5 MBPD of >priced foreign oil. And exports ~2.3 MBPD oil + Saudi oil products&tankers of gasoline&whatever China et al. don’t report.
5991 2018-05-08 17:30:34 What does AAA know. You need educated on the facts. Why doesn’t anyone complain about oil subsidies?
5992 2018-05-08 17:30:32 And the price of oil goes up as a result to the benefit of Trumps oilmen buddies.

5997 2018-05-08 17:30:18 Things I don't understand: confirmation that Iran deal is going to be scuttled, but oil is down 3% today. Maybe people know that this is a delay rather than a full pull-out?
5998 2018-05-08 17:30:16 What about the fact we are choking out life on earth with unnecessary hydrocarbon energy, and increasing the amount of oil infrastructure digs our hole deeper.
5999 2018-05-08 17:30:16 And they know this, how?
Trump is now expected to restore sanctions on Iran's oil exportsWITHOUT OFFERING EVIDENCE  that Iran has violated the nuclear deal.
6000 2018-05-08 17:30:15 The USA controls the trade of oil as it is almost exclusively traded in dollars through US banks. This is part of the design to break the US petrodollar by Russia (why trump was aided). I have this from OCTOBER 2016 from one of the Russian trolls...

6002 2018-05-08 17:30:14 The oil price had a bit to do with it in the 80s as well, similar to every recession. We don’t control the oil price and we can’t have oil companies pay no taxes. Where do you suggest our future revenue comes from?  We need diversification not double down. #ableg #LakeOfFireParty

6006 2018-05-08 17:29:49 I bet you that Trump has a financial interest in increasing the price of oil. He'd take the world to the edge of destruction if he can make a buck on it. #IranDeal

6008 2018-05-08 17:29:42 Government run food markets where food is left to spoil in warehouses. All companies in sectors deemed strategic in Venezuela were seized and nationalized. Ironically, those are the industries in Venezuela that cause the most issues. Oil, electricity, food etc.
6009 2018-05-08 17:29:37 Not at all. I ditched the telly back in 2005 a week after I found myself looking in the mirror one a.m. "I wonder if it would actually delay my first wrinkle?" It had been an Oil of Olay ad planting that on my mind. Talk about making other people's your problems. I'm only 42 now.
6010 2018-05-08 17:29:35 That's interesting growth in GDP...  With a period of ten years, Indonesia did a great amount of work to add $ 975 billion to their GDP.  

What constitutes Indonesia's GPD?  Is oil part of it?
6011 2018-05-08 17:29:30 It's been nice recently and I've run out of rosehip so I've been using vitamin e oil instead.
6012 2018-05-08 17:29:29 Weaponized with decades of experience with developing warfare and economic resilience, #Iran will probably absorb the withdrawal's intial impacts, if the #EU continues to import oil. #Iran is already de facto disconnected from the SWIFT system and FDI is weak #JCPOA

6016 2018-05-08 17:29:14 Oil was $71 a barrel 2 days ago..today it’s $68...pull out of the Iran deal and it’s headed to $62. Watch and learn boy
6017 2018-05-08 17:29:14 Time to take a break from oil tweeting and go outside. The market will be f’d up for days if not weeks.

6023 2018-05-08 17:29:00 Getting your oil changed at your manufacturers suggested intervals is one of the BEST things you can do for the longevity of your vehicle.
6024 2018-05-08 17:28:55 It's important to have your brakes checked AT LEAST once every six months, but it is better to have them looked at each time you get an oil change to make sure everything is in working order. Keep your vehicle in tip-top shape with a call to us today - (512) 292-6969
6025 2018-05-08 17:28:42 The US produces 10.6 million barrels per day of oil. Same amount as Russia so your conspiracy theory kind of falls apart.
6026 2018-05-08 17:28:41 ถ้าเป็นอย่างนั้น 
6027 2018-05-08 17:28:38 Um, I don’t read it that way? It says Malaysian diplomats threatened the sale due to EU palm oil proposals and Brit diplomats reported that?
6028 2018-05-08 17:28:30 The thing was it wasn't a repeal. Simply a vote to open debate to fix it. They never could have repealed anyway lacking 60 votes

6032 2018-05-08 17:28:18 And its true. He got caught in a RICO Collusion scam trying to shake down oil companies.  He and his buddy AGs sued to see all corproate emails....they sued back to see all AG communications.....turns out Schneiderman was the RICO scammer. Judge threw them out.

6034 2018-05-08 17:28:15 Oil prices to go up $5-$10.

Two thirds of Americans want to stay in the deal.

His own cabinet wants to stay in the deal.

Our allies want us to stay in the deal.

HE has confirmed the deal is working.

...and yet, because it was an Obama deal

#MAGA? No f'ing way
6035 2018-05-08 17:28:12 Oil prices will continue plummet under this administration
6036 2018-05-08 17:28:12 Yes, cancel the Iran deal. Thank you trumpet we Asians need the cheap oil to sell you cheap stuff, there ya boy Donny
6037 2018-05-08 17:28:12 This helps Russia by increasing oil prices.
6038 2018-05-08 17:28:06 @MikeSmythNews Ha ha Mike, that pension plan was constructed by Liberals.  Also I made 15% on my RRSP last year. Index funds.  Far better than oil and gas long term.
6039 2018-05-08 17:28:01 Had a coupon for an oil change, but Honda wouldn't change my oil at 15%.

6043 2018-05-08 17:27:23 Great insight today from Laura Speake of @CaterpillarInc about construction and oil markets at the @MSCITweets annual conference in Atlanta!
6044 2018-05-08 17:27:21 I know this is minor in the scheme of things but for the moment it will be devastating to many middle class and poor Americans. Watch the oil prices now go through the roof.
6045 2018-05-08 17:27:20 Relax, Operation Iranian Liberation (OIL) coming soon

6047 2018-05-08 17:27:07 That sounds ideal, but is that just another PR scheme? And what over-sight/accountability is there? Do these ethically minded palm oil companies work w/ animal rescue, environmental rescue ppl to ensure no-harm policies are effective? 4GIVE me my cynic 
6048 2018-05-08 17:27:05 Hey I’m sorry to tell you this but our oil actually barely even comes from Iran. In the 1940’s FDR signed a trade deal with the saudis that is still used today. And considering that the saudis and Iranians are enemies, this might actually help oil prices go down.

6051 2018-05-08 17:26:51 We haven't forgotten that it were the US and the UK who together  committed a coup against a democratically elected PM of Iran in 1954 to put the Shah in place so you could seize its oil.

6055 2018-05-08 17:26:43 YFC- We Invaded a country just to take it over for it's oil and natural resources. That's the game. Read Yellow Fringe.

6061 2018-05-08 17:26:27 Trump you are the one hurting our country!I guess you want Iran to have nuclear weapons and raise oil prices in our country!So much for #MAGA.The only thing you are doing is  making China great!
6062 2018-05-08 17:26:21 Or how about the fact that killing it will result in higher oil prices. Whose economy is struggling mightily now? Putin’s. Who would benefit immensely from higher oil prices? Putin. Who can create that scenario? Trump. Who takes his commands from Putin? Again, Trump. Do the math.

6070 2018-05-08 17:26:03 Come in to get an oil change, apparently I need a lot more  my poor little car
6071 2018-05-08 17:25:57 Or is @POTUS determined to void the #IranDeal to initiate skyrocketing #oil prices making fracking and other destructive #mining activities more cost effective in the US? Bears Ears National Monument will be a starting point for his #corruption.
6072 2018-05-08 17:25:48 idk how people wait an hour for an oil change I have no patience .. gave that nigga the keys like call me when it’s over 
6073 2018-05-08 17:25:46 Does it even matter what the final decision on Iran will be anymore?

By even considering a withdrawal from Iran's deal, US has demonstrated that it it's word is worthless. Any oil producing country, no matter how much they dislike China, can no longer ignore the PetroYuanGold.
6074 2018-05-08 17:25:43 Rosneft (Putin) will rake in higher profits when oil prices go up as a result of Trump pulling out of the #IranDeal.

It also empowers hardliners in Iran and pushes that country even closer to Russia while further reducing US influence on the world stage (another Putin desire).
6075 2018-05-08 17:25:42 Is extra virgin olive oil safe?
6076 2018-05-08 17:25:38 Saudia Arabia is hurting over a low oil price.
Israel has done a deal with Saudi Arabia and is now saying Iran has reneged on it's nuclear program.
Trump needs Israeli, SA support and the distractions of a Gulf standoff.
6077 2018-05-08 17:25:34 Venezuelas economy collapsed due to issued with oil. Just so you know

6079 2018-05-08 17:25:27 It's really very similar to how a similarly sized sudden drop in oil prices crippled Venezuela
6080 2018-05-08 17:25:26 It makes sense because oil has no business being here. Of course people like you are just peddlers so.....
6081 2018-05-08 17:25:25 Yes i want that event maybe we will get that next time,we will have to wait for collecting some oil 
6082 2018-05-08 17:25:17 BREAKING: Final hr of trade might get very volatile due to pending news @realDonaldTrump will exit the #IranNuclearDeal. Stox falling, oil down 3%, folks, this could all change, we are MUST SEE biz t.v. 3pET @ClamanCountdown
6083 2018-05-08 17:25:15 I'm sure they're going to be thrilled once Iran resumes their nuclear weapons program, buys air defense weapons from Israel, and oil prices skyrocket to the massive benefit of Russia.

But you're too fucking stupid to see beyond "OBAMA BAD!"
6084 2018-05-08 17:25:14 Why would it not be so? When there's the free oil money to throw around.
6085 2018-05-08 17:25:02 #PETROYUAN is a solid narrative that supplants petroeuro & other precedents-will be true if you believe in it. Buy why would non-US oil buyers want to be forced to purchase Chinese debt?  Also, isn't the value of the petroyuan purchases offset by the growth in US exports?
6086 2018-05-08 17:24:52 4) The price of crude oil will skyrocket immediately.

6107 2018-05-08 17:23:02 So much for #GOPTaxScam & all those tax “cuts” 4 lower/middle income families when gas prices soar with withdrawal. Total wash. But oil & gas industry who benefitted from tax scam will b laughing all the way to the bank with higher prices. Let’s see @GOP @GOPChairwoman spin this!
6108 2018-05-08 17:22:58 I think the renewable fuels industry should copy the oil industry and just fabricate bargaining chips similar to RINs for export... counter with ethanol produced in Iowa only counts as a half a RIN
6109 2018-05-08 17:22:56 You can’t be that stupid.. how much oil do you think we actually get from Iran? Damn you people spreading lies just because you don’t like the president.. please take a long walk of a short pier
6110 2018-05-08 17:22:50 Taking advantage of having the 3rd most oil reserves on the planet would create a lot of jobs as well. But we seem to be too dumb to make money from things we have and the world needs.
6111 2018-05-08 17:22:48 Actually, Russian Oil will benefit.

6115 2018-05-08 17:22:27 the #ethanol industry has been working on #e15 for at least 7 years.  

e15 is a cleaner and cheaper fuel.

Yet, market penetration is low because of YUGE barriers to entry caused by merchant refiners and big oil.

Please explain this "Free market" principle to me again.
6116 2018-05-08 17:22:21 Oil india assam is doing project and is taking hell lot of time.govt organization hence least bothered contractors are suffering. Don't talk lies
6117 2018-05-08 17:22:19 Owned it over a year now. First repairs we've done on it besides oil changes, so it's not terrible but still. That's like the last of my credit ..
6118 2018-05-08 17:22:17 Why is the price of American Crude falling on news Trump is pulling out of Iran? Shouldn't oil prices increase?
6119 2018-05-08 17:22:15 Also remember him standing on border promosing to build a wall in ads. He went back on that also. The ppl decided electing Trump as party
6120 2018-05-08 17:22:10 Putin promises Russians might, prosperity and glory. In fact he presides over a small economy dependent on oil, gas and minerals. Civil liberties are very restricted.The poor are very poor indeed. Cynics have called it ‘Africa with snow’ or ‘Chad with nuclear weapons’.
6121 2018-05-08 17:21:50 So edgy man! The Nazi hipster beard oil ads must generate some revenue over there. Is that where Southern buys her beard oil?
6122 2018-05-08 17:21:44 So we can buy Saudi oil at twice the price, let Iran build a Nuke, and please Putin and SA. While screwing Americans at the pump?
6123 2018-05-08 17:21:43 Today I stopped by the Holiday Oil on South Mountain and the guy working there said, "howdy champ" as I walked in. Boy, did I feel special.
6124 2018-05-08 17:21:35 Looks like the #IranDeal is going to be abrogated.

Thank goodness.  Europeans will defend because they love selling expensive high tech to rogue regimes, oil-for-food, etc.
6125 2018-05-08 17:21:26 No, marching lock-step with the Republicans. That’s their way. Right or wrong they are forced to vote together. Obamacare has its faults for sure. Simply repealing it is stupid and not what The American People want. He was right there, as required; in the “Make Obama Fail” plan
6126 2018-05-08 17:21:19 Metals and oil are NOT currencies though! Your point makes no sense.
6127 2018-05-08 17:21:19 I’m like a kid on christmas, and will do most deffff it’ll be at my house Saturday, I will blow down some oil properly 
6128 2018-05-08 17:21:12 We all knew @realDonaldTrump was leaving the #IranDeal because:

1) He's racist against Muslims
2) He wants further instability in the Middle East
3) His oil/gas/@GOP friends want the price of gas to go up
5) #Putin/#Russia's economy is dependent on the barrel price of oil!
6129 2018-05-08 17:21:05 I thought increasing oil prices was your goal on the progressive left? Increasing costs will lower demand & use, right? Lower use suppresses climate damage, right? So, applying the left's rules, @realDonaldTrump pulling out of #IranNuclearDeal stops global warming and cooling.
6130 2018-05-08 17:21:04 Helps with the itchy too. Plus if u have a pet with the itchies add some olive oil to the rice. Or any healthier oil.
6131 2018-05-08 17:20:55 Any destabilization of the middle east will increase the price of oil. This is an important goal of the Russians (to ensure long term, high-priced need for their fossil fuel reserves), and seems consistent with the expressed ideals of the Trump administration.

Remember you are actually a communist; not a congress clone.
And no I can assure you hell will not breakout; oil prices have been fluctuating wildly since 1973; nobody died due to it.
So don't be scared, don't wet .......!

6147 2018-05-08 17:19:24 Netanyahu and Kushner are behind this Fiasco. Oil Prices are going to rise.
6148 2018-05-08 17:19:23 You’re an idiot. Pulling out of Iran deal sends a message to North Korea that we can’t keep a deal; It allows Iran to go back to creating WWMDs; It puts us on a path to war w/Iran; & gas/oil prices will go through the roof. All this b/c Trump is jealous of a former black POTUS.
6149 2018-05-08 17:19:02 its been eating up the news since oil trading at 60$..moreover even if sanctions on it takes half year to impact. & euro still in the deal ..nothing changes for Iran.
6150 2018-05-08 17:19:01 it was all fine for Trump until Pruitt started to fuck with the guy who's opening national parks to oil drilling

6159 2018-05-08 17:18:28 John Kerry was smart enough to negotiate this deal.  The US knows what’s up. You are killing this deal to drive up the price of oil so your Russian allies can cash in and justify drilling in new deep water.  Too bad this strategy will backfire and renewables will look cheap
6160 2018-05-08 17:18:17 Directions:
Blend the avocado then add the milk and the oil. Massage the mixture on the scalp, from the roots to the hair ends. Cover your hair with a plastic shower cup and let it sit for 15 minutes. Wash with warm water and a normal shampoo without using conditioner.

6163 2018-05-08 17:18:04 I wonder....maybe when Russia offers to sell us some of their oil, for cheaper....

6166 2018-05-08 17:17:53 You mean virgin olive oil?
6167 2018-05-08 17:17:51 @wolfblitzer IRAN deal is ONLY a money deal. Those who are worry about @realDonaldTrump breaking it are only worry for their business and investments they have in IRAN. Oil prices
6168 2018-05-08 17:17:43 I am grateful for the financial and quality of life benefits the oil and gas industry brings to all Canadians and the world. The world needs more Canada.

6169 2018-05-08 17:17:35 Do u use oil?  Oil companies have made human existence far better than if they never existed.  Human suffering is at its lowest point in our existence and much is to do with cheap and plentiful energy from fossil fuel.  Name a measurement where humans are worse off today?
6170 2018-05-08 17:17:30 Meanwhile, they cite once largely white nations with access to oil and a formerly long history of commerce/capitalism as successful examples of socialism, even though crime and many other outcomes have been getting worse since the inception of it.

6174 2018-05-08 17:17:25 Dollar (67.07) च्या तुलनेत रुपया घसरला याचा परिणाम आंतराष्ट्रीय बाजारात कच्च्या तेलाच्या ( Crude oil ) किंमतीत वाढ होत आहे...पेट्रोल, डिझेल च्या किंमतीत वाढ होण्याची शक्यता
6175 2018-05-08 17:17:25 Look oil... dead rigid catering 
6176 2018-05-08 17:17:17 well it's sorrowful for you not to think the way I do, am not that kind and can never be, to me he supposed to busy finding solution to the people's killing.
6177 2018-05-08 17:17:07 I know the feeling! I haven’t oil painted in over a year and it’s like being dick deprived. I need it NOW!lol...I’m ok. Just in the middle of moving houses. What brings you back to LA?
6178 2018-05-08 17:17:06 Wow, watch oil shares rocket tomorrow!!!
6179 2018-05-08 17:16:56 姿勢が45°傾いてませんか？
6180 2018-05-08 17:16:52 Believe the memes! Jet-fuel can’t melt steel beams! Nuclear power is making dolphins violent! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
6181 2018-05-08 17:16:49 I heard on CBC last week that American oil refiners need Canada bitumen to add to their thinner oil produced cause the refinery was constructed to handle a thicker fluid. America needs bitumen Frazier Institute left that out. @CKNW
6182 2018-05-08 17:16:38 what do you do for the 10+ minutes after your bath/shower that it takes for the coconut oil you’ve slathered all over yourself to dry
6183 2018-05-08 17:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
6184 2018-05-08 17:16:27 Anything with glycerin sets my skin off because it's oily. Oil+oil never works. Have you tried it though?
6185 2018-05-08 17:16:25 Hey Dummy, Americas the ones that negotiated this deal. We are in this up to our elbows. Dotard Donny is the one that wants to get out so his oil company buddies can make some money off of it and his defense industry buddies to make money off the impending war
6186 2018-05-08 17:16:18 Let's see if gas prices go up.  Funny, if we don't buy Iranian oil, we will probably buy more from Russia.  It all comes down to $ for Trump, and Americans will deal with the fallout.
6187 2018-05-08 17:16:13 Says the Ndp shill when @jjhorgan invests millions in oil companies for public sector pensions LMAO
6188 2018-05-08 17:16:05 Its always about money with trump.  Looks like the Saudis&putin will be big winners with less Iranian oil. And who is he in bed with???? Hmm
6189 2018-05-08 17:15:57 And up, up, up goes the price of oil which should make Papa Putin and Russia's faltering economy - basically reliant on oil - very, very happy.
6190 2018-05-08 17:15:51 Hey #MAGA Devotees & Trump Enthusiasts ... don't you find it ironic that the primary beneficiaries of nuking the #IranDeal are #DeepState All-Stars like Big Oil, The Military-Industrial Complex & their longtime partners in Saudi Arabia? #ProfiteersOfDoom #DeepStateOfDenial #Rubes
6191 2018-05-08 17:15:44 Gold plated oil?
6192 2018-05-08 17:15:37 今年の夏に会う予定はない！
6193 2018-05-08 17:15:37 It makes no sense that oil is selling off--If he exits deal --u think he allows them to sell oil? doubtful --Tensions increased #oott
6194 2018-05-08 17:15:35 I need a extra good oil treatment  can’t wait til I get one
6195 2018-05-08 17:15:21 Oil and Oli companies are best these days. But, don't worry. They're seeking alternatives.
6196 2018-05-08 17:15:16 Bloody mindedness helps too! @lynneahpd provided strategic leadership and permission and @Slb70B and others professional leadership which helped to oil the wheels significantly. All worth it in the end!
6197 2018-05-08 17:15:05 Foreign direct investment in Canada is at lowest since 2010. Can't get products, any of them, to mkt efficiently. CN CP Trains R loaded with Oil Tanker cars but Canola, Wheat, Lumber, minerals R stalled.  This is price we pay for eco-zealots dictating policy
6198 2018-05-08 17:15:01 Oil change 
6199 2018-05-08 17:14:52 And don't get me started about baby oil!
6200 2018-05-08 17:14:49 It is good for higher Oil prices, that makes it good for Russia, part of Trumps America second approach.

6205 2018-05-08 17:14:05 Right now we're using a lot of foreign oil. I would like to see us stop that. If it means pipelines then I'm ok with that. I totally agree that finding ways to throttle the usage will benefit our grandchildren. Tankers in our waterways are not the answer
6206 2018-05-08 17:13:54 Government has failed in its duty in serviliamce of its servants who are public servant and are paid by the citizens of india. The @narendramodi should take serious steps in checking completely all public servants and bring in accountability and responsibilities in open domain.
6207 2018-05-08 17:13:48 Increase of oil prices would benefit Russia’s economy
6208 2018-05-08 17:13:47 @realDonaldTrump Supreme Court ruled in OIL STATES.  America is over.  Send all your best ideas to SCOTUS, DC.  They own them even if you have not thought of them yet.  The shame of it is using a plant pedophile to write the doctrine of the destruction of America.  Wow.  Rome V
6209 2018-05-08 17:13:43 Phew! Big day of teeth cleaning, oil changing, grocery getting, and (SOON) splicer killing! Part two of my Bioshock run around 1:30CST.
6210 2018-05-08 17:13:34 She blocked me for laughing when she snapped on someone for suggesting coconut oil for a toothache.
6211 2018-05-08 17:13:28 And Russia. Isn't oil one of the major Russian exports?
6212 2018-05-08 17:13:26 Somebody most be profiting! His whole *agenda* is a pay-to-play scam for corporations, oil moguls, and the ultra-ultra rich, period!
6213 2018-05-08 17:13:24 weird to see the oil at - with the sanction being resumed

6217 2018-05-08 17:13:06 Putin’s Russia would benefit from rising oil prices created by more instability in the Middle Rast.
6218 2018-05-08 17:12:59 Shredder oil. Last suggestion to clear the jammed blasted shredder. 
Reverse, grinding squealing gears, forward, the same.
Tried the tweezers, thin pointed pliers. A darning needle to loosen the paper, and break it up. 
Didn't obey the 3 minute operating suggestion. Bastard.
6219 2018-05-08 17:12:58 My name at Firestone is Cyssani. I literally give that name when I go to change my oil because I don’t feel like explaining/correcting anyone lmao.
6220 2018-05-08 17:12:54 got hair oil in my eye . fml
6221 2018-05-08 17:12:54 this is about pushing up the price of oil as requested by a close friend of his...........any guesses.......he could care less about the deal
6222 2018-05-08 17:12:52 cbd oil is legal and might help this. (straight up vaping weed is what i use but i understand it's a different calculation for everyone)
6223 2018-05-08 17:12:47 idk what’s worse, hair flying into your lipgloss or little bugs flying into your tanning oil 
6224 2018-05-08 17:12:41 Was just going to whine about that but glad you did.  Oil is already going up in anticipation of this AHoles withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal.  This nightmare can’t end soon enough.
6225 2018-05-08 17:12:39 So trump will also add new sanctions on top of leaving the deal ...see crude oil price better fly like a fresh angry rocket
6226 2018-05-08 17:12:38 Why not just bathe in oil then? It's probably slightly more healthy.
6227 2018-05-08 17:12:37 Please tell THE PEOPLE what other parks will you be giving away to the oil boys ot better yet how about you tell us how clean our water, air & land really is with all the pipeline breaks, coal fired smokestacks & toxic chemicals pumped into the land for gas extraction

6230 2018-05-08 17:12:31 Possibly the best thing is how often people whom I don't know at all tell me that CBD oil will save me.

Keep telling me that.
6231 2018-05-08 17:12:25 "Benefits" of Trump pulling out of #IranDeal:
Eventual war with Iran killing millions
Skyrocketing oil prices
Alienating US Allies
More US soldiers casualties of neocon war
Iran gets nukes
Middle East war starts WWIII
US diplomacy destroyed
* Iran is 3X the size of Iraq
6232 2018-05-08 17:12:21 Isolating the US from its allies and raising the price of oil. All this winning is exhausting
6233 2018-05-08 17:12:20 As the #crypto market matures, crypto investors can’t afford to ignore the geopolitical events which tend to have big impacts on markets

Take #IranDeal which’s causing swings today in future, FX and oil market.. investors in such case flies to safe haven assets as dig-gold $BTC

6239 2018-05-08 17:11:56 Where are the solar panels coming from ? Shipped through oil guzzling ships from China ? :-)
6240 2018-05-08 17:11:51 The most brutal terrorists use missiles and MOABS. WAR is the name used to kill millions for land and oil and get away with it.
6241 2018-05-08 17:11:46 The most dishonest ever???? Your sure about that? Have you forgotten about the bush and son oil brigade that left hundreds of thousands of families with loved ones dead or with severe PTSD? Yeah your right her doing this is way worse. #sosmart
6242 2018-05-08 17:11:36 Spray or wipe down cords with something distasteful to the cat. Hot sauce; lavender oil; a homemade citrus or vinegar paste; garlic, cayenne pepper, Vicks, dish soap, lime juice, chili oil or paste. Or use a light coating of sports ointments (the really strong menthol sort).

6244 2018-05-08 17:11:26 Like North Korea? Oh wait. They just used fake currency and starved their people. Iran has fucking OIL. Sanctions only go so far especially when the rest of the world is in the deal.
6245 2018-05-08 17:11:16 If you have good names that will perform well with oil at 65+ you are in good shape
6246 2018-05-08 17:11:13 i oil the barrel before use
6247 2018-05-08 17:11:08 Cost of oil increases, paying more at the pump, Iran not selling oil due to sanctions. Trump's friends get richer. Israel at more risk, US & allies must go help Israel = 3rd gulf war
6248 2018-05-08 17:11:08 いや。うん。そりゃ高いよ…。
6249 2018-05-08 17:11:08 @realDonaldTrump Not backing out of the Iran deal is trading security for cheaper oil. The right thing to do is back-out of the Iran deal.
6250 2018-05-08 17:11:05 Trump exits Iran deal
This causes price oil to increase
This helps #Russia and it’s economy 
Putin likes and needs this. 
Clear?
6251 2018-05-08 17:10:53 How will the cost of gas double? We get very little oil from Iran or the Middle East at all for that matter. There’s more oil in the US than Iran

6260 2018-05-08 17:10:18 Maybe it’s time to build a pipeline from Dubai threw U.A.E. or become less dependent on oil !
6261 2018-05-08 17:10:16 Dow down 71 points.  Oil prices volatile on expected Iran Nuclear Deal news, price down $3 dollars crude barrel. Trump expected to announce US will no longer suspend sanctions aimed at Iran's oil exports effectively exiting the deal. Is it a stunt for negotiating? #IranDeal
6262 2018-05-08 17:10:13 also can you please add that oil has gone up because opec is price fixing and that impacts dollar demand as well #rs
6263 2018-05-08 17:10:13 @Nissan @NissanUSA needs new service reps and better ppl online.....they gave me a coupon that didn't even work for my car and tried to charge $100 for my oil change

6267 2018-05-08 17:10:02 Why are oil prices dropping today?
6268 2018-05-08 17:09:57 I’m sure it’s just a coincidence, but does anyone care that pulling out of Iran deal will boost wealth of oil companies and oil countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia (at consumers’ expense, of course)?
6269 2018-05-08 17:09:55 Big cheers and hugs from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. oil companies.

6272 2018-05-08 17:09:29 Oil prices falling ahead of Trump announcing likely end of Iran deal.
6273 2018-05-08 17:09:28 Not oil fuelled? Refreshing for citeh.
6274 2018-05-08 17:09:26 Only due to investors betting #Trump will lesson or phase the sanctions and Iran will continue foreign sale of their oil. If not, oil and gasoline prices will rise.
6275 2018-05-08 17:09:26 Don’t dash my hopes ok? I for one wanna see 120bbl oil prices! Lmao

6279 2018-05-08 17:09:12 ...and will raise oil prices. Vladimir Putin thanks you, mr. president.
6280 2018-05-08 17:09:07 I have tried like 10 times now Fish Oil + Roc Tounge
I get anything but Courage Tonic :/
6281 2018-05-08 17:09:05 Coincidentally? Higher oil prices aren’t just a good thing for Vlad Putin, they’re actually crucial to his very survival at this point 
6282 2018-05-08 17:09:01 It comes with elevation, man. I worked too hard for that oil! 
6283 2018-05-08 17:08:58 On Election Day November 2016 the price of oil was $46 per barrel. This was crippling Russia since 90% of their economy derives from oil. 

Today the price is $70 and climbing, conflict with Iran will send it to $130 or higher.

Still wonder why Putin voted for Trump?
6284 2018-05-08 17:08:56 Oil prices will go up
Putin will make$$
Other Middle East countries will make$$
Due to sanctions Iran will turn to Russia and China
We are even more isolated from our European allies
This doesn't benefit the US at all but I think it's very important to look at who it does benefit
6285 2018-05-08 17:08:47 Oil is awesome. Glad he pisses you off.

6287 2018-05-08 17:08:34 You.. mr art of the deal, is about to give up a deal that bars Iran from a nuclear weapon. And the return for walking away? Nothing.

Worse than nothing, it frees Iran to return to their nuclear weapon development and we aid that by the end of the agreement pushing up oil costs.
6288 2018-05-08 17:08:28 One I don't even watch any more. Safe as houses. Time in the market will pay off handsomely. Oil in a powerful uptrend. They need to snap up those other wells now.
6289 2018-05-08 17:08:27 So what's your plan????? Oh that's right! You don't have one or do you. How much money are you going to make on Oil because it's going to skyrocket! $$$$$$$ Scammer in Chief!
6290 2018-05-08 17:08:27 So here is another scenario, Big oil wants more of the pool, they want their 10% back, if the rins get cheap enough, they will just buy 1 cent to not blend, sell more 87 full conv, less bob.
6291 2018-05-08 17:08:22 And US will just up its own oil production barrel for barrel. EU needs our energy AND DEFENSE more than they need Iran's BRIBES
6292 2018-05-08 17:08:22 Yes I remember and very well. But there was the fried dumplings and saltfish cooked down in fresh coconut oil and lots of tomatoes. Coming home from school and soaking wet. U smelled that chocolate and a boy went to bed contented

6297 2018-05-08 17:07:58 Y’all watch out @ Cumberland. They back at it with the roll on oil perfume.
6298 2018-05-08 17:07:53 Why not cut subsidies to Big Oil and other wealthy corporations that we subsidize.  CONS are disgusting.
6299 2018-05-08 17:07:44 1- IMPORTANT/ In the last three months I have come to realize that key government and #oil industry officials have held meetings to come up with a number of scenarios to help face all eventualities should the US leave the #JCPOA. #OOTT #IranDeal
6300 2018-05-08 17:07:34 Not possible Alan, far too much in the way of money/vested interests at stake. Best way to hit back - stop buying products that contain palm oil - which, today, is a vast number of products. Hit back, don't buy.
6301 2018-05-08 17:07:32 Nothing really, just went in for an oil change and turns out I desperately need an alignment because my tires are almost bald. So all that, plus new tires on the horizon. 
6302 2018-05-08 17:07:30 Have they discovered oil?
6303 2018-05-08 17:07:27 Almost all bars have oil and BS ,, good to find a “No BS” product atlast. They are so good !
6304 2018-05-08 17:07:26 It's about the impossibility of tracking cash. Does anyone believe that the mullahs who govern Iran take vows of poverty? The don't make investments? Have zero net worth. Short Iranian oil? What % of cash went to Obama Swiss accounts? Kerry's? HRC? Brennan's? etc.

6307 2018-05-08 17:07:20 Trump puts the interests of Israel & Saudi Arabia ahead of America's national interest and & interests of our allies. 

A reduction in Iranian oil on the world market will lead to an increase in the price of oil, which will be immensely beneficial to the Russians and the Saudis.
6308 2018-05-08 17:07:10 One day, they’ll pour oil into a lake just to show they don’t care about the environment.
6309 2018-05-08 17:07:04 $100 dollar oil
6310 2018-05-08 17:07:03 Why is it that since your election the price of light sweet crude oil has jumped from $45 a barrel to $70 a barrel, representing a 50% increase? Oh, I know why, because Russia's biggest export is oil!! How does a 50% increase in oil help the downtrodden MAGA heads you represent?
6311 2018-05-08 17:07:01 Yeah I saw a study from a few years ago that broke it out by sector, and basically all the output increases were in electronics and manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.
6312 2018-05-08 17:06:49 And US will just up its own oil production barrel for barrel. EU needs our energy AND DEFENSE more than they need Iran's BRIBES
6313 2018-05-08 17:06:40 Yea, the oil investors will make bundles.
6314 2018-05-08 17:06:37 I reported the opinion of a scientist who works with bitumen, she says oil sands is the correct term and explained why. Whatever. Call it what you want.
6315 2018-05-08 17:06:36 We applaud the #innovators behind the technology selected thru the ERA Oil Sands Innovation Challenge. Project leaders are from: Heavy Oil Solutions, Enlighten Innovations (formerly Field Upgrading), @MEGEnergy, @ImperialOil, @Suncor, @cenovus, @conocophillips and @CNRLCorporate.
6316 2018-05-08 17:06:34 Yeah, cause everybody wants less protection! Tell Scott Pruitt we like more pollution too! And forget clean energy, we like dirty coal and messy oil spills! Are we great yet?
6317 2018-05-08 17:06:28 just what I’d want after getting t-boned by a drunk driver and seeing my femur sticking out of my leg, think a little lavender oil would be nice, SMH
6318 2018-05-08 17:06:27 I honestly think it's to make oil prices go up. Oil & gas are his patrons. But good for Tesla long term.
6319 2018-05-08 17:06:24 In 1953 the CIA orchestrated a coup to depose Iran's democratically elected PM Mossadegh, who dared to nationalise Iran's oil industry. Remember this when the world talks about US - Iran relations, and when the media casts one or other as the villain. #Trump #NuclearDeal
6320 2018-05-08 17:06:05 Iran wins this round AND they keep the $billions. Also, Oil is up .... Russia and Saudi’s win. America first ?
6321 2018-05-08 17:05:57 The oil would still be deep down too.
6322 2018-05-08 17:05:52 Saying ‘Russia’ every time Trump Snr does an international move feels like a cliche, yet here I am born out by the facts.
Footnote: oil price also helps out the Saudis...
6323 2018-05-08 17:05:49 I guess it’s true the USA word means nothing.  Get ready for oil wars.
6324 2018-05-08 17:05:44 But seriously, WTF does the Iran deal or no deal have to do w/ markets? Oil maybe. It seems like it's a gross abuse of the magic 8 ball to infer all that other sinister shite.

•a plastic shower cap.
6326 2018-05-08 17:05:38 Gave Spike an oil massage. You can’t imagine how hard it is because his main aim during the oil massage is to lap up the coconut oil from the bowl. 
6327 2018-05-08 17:05:34 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
6328 2018-05-08 17:05:31 Oil prices plunge ahead of Trump's Iran decision
6329 2018-05-08 17:05:30 He's doing it to destabilize oil markets, drive up price, and make Putin happy.
6330 2018-05-08 17:05:28 I’m mad b/c straight niggas work at the 5 minute oil change on bluebonnet lmao
6331 2018-05-08 17:05:24 Palm oil or crude oil
6332 2018-05-08 17:05:23 * Isis decimated    * The eve of peace in N Korea
* oil prices dropping * lowest unemployment in 20 years.
6333 2018-05-08 17:05:17 I TOLD YOU THIS WAS ABOUT THE  "OIL" THE NUCLEAR DEAL, NOW ALL OF AMERICA'S POOR & MIDDLE CLASS WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR GAS, WHILE THE GOP GO  TO THEIR MANY HOME WITH $1.5TRILLION WAITING FOR THEM & THEIR FRIEND IN THEIR BANKS.
6334 2018-05-08 17:05:17 While higher oil prices benefit Russia.
6335 2018-05-08 17:05:12 You know most of the oil exported from Iran goes to China and India right?
6336 2018-05-08 17:05:11 how can iran pay to support all of those military excursions if oil money dries up again?
6337 2018-05-08 17:05:09 Apparently magnolia oil from pep sis.
6338 2018-05-08 17:05:09 แจมหยุดโตทีง
6339 2018-05-08 17:05:06 If @realDonaldTrump pulls out of the Iran Nuclear Deal the price of oil will go UP, the stock market will go further DOWN, and North Korea will have no reason to kraft a deal @realDonaldTrump won’t honor! Please #ImpeachTrump soon!!
6340 2018-05-08 17:05:03 And drives the price of oil up, which is massively profitable for Vladimir.

6342 2018-05-08 17:04:56 Is #POTUS #Trump about to prop up #oil prices for his #Russian creditors and buddy #Putin ?
6343 2018-05-08 17:04:54 My grandmother has a super creepy giant oil painting of Palliacchi in her living room. I have no fucking clue why.
6344 2018-05-08 17:04:43 Both really worthwhile cars.  I was at a conference yesterday where several speakers thought $100/bl oil was certainly possible.  You have to wonder if Ford won't ultimately regret this...
6345 2018-05-08 17:04:39 If they claim to be patriots. There will be less money in their patriotic pockets when oil prices skyrocket. Fuckin idiots.
6346 2018-05-08 17:04:39 Rosneft (Putin) will rake in higher profits when oil prices go up as a result of Trump pulling out of the #IranDeal.

It also empowers hardliners in Iran and pushes that country even closer to Russia while further reducing US influence on the world stage (another Putin desire).
6347 2018-05-08 17:04:38 Potential upheavals the crude oil market likely as @realDonaldTrump set to announce decision on America-Iran nuclear deal.

If he scraps the deal and restores sanctions against Iran, then Oil producing countries could witness a boon from rise in prices caused by lower supply
6348 2018-05-08 17:04:37 The president doesn’t have a clue what he is doing. He couldn’t find his way out of the proverbial paper bag. But he is going to open Pandora’s box to raise oil prices, foment hatred, promote arms sales and give an excuse for martial law. His goal is an American oligarchy.
6349 2018-05-08 17:04:34 One oil spill will take care of that .. @JustinTrudeau @bcndp @wildernews @BowinnMa @JonathanWNV @pgoldsmithjones @Schtaunkhauser @mtnbvan
6350 2018-05-08 17:04:27 I just accidentally sprayed tanning oil straight into my eye 
6351 2018-05-08 17:04:11 US $oil down more than 3%, back below $70. conflicting reports on whether Trump would pull out of #IranNuclearDeal caused wild swings and put oil traders on edge.
6352 2018-05-08 17:04:08 Oil prices down 3% today. Go figure.
6353 2018-05-08 17:04:03 So how much #TrumpCrimeFamily money is invested in oil futures?
#IranDeal #MiddleEast
6354 2018-05-08 17:03:59 Trump is working for @KremlinRussia_E. Have you heard anything from Russia about killing the Iran deal? Of course not. Putin gets higher oil prices and nuclear armed Iran. Trump is a traitor but now Mueller will have concrete proof of aid and comfort. Go ahead @realDonaldTrump.

6356 2018-05-08 17:03:57 So now the Russians can begin trade in oil and nuclear materials to Iran again? Tsk, tsk, tsk!
6357 2018-05-08 17:03:54 $XOM Trump taking down the Iran deal. Bullish signal for Oil stocks.
6358 2018-05-08 17:03:54 Rosneft (Putin) will rake in higher profits when oil prices go up as a result of Trump pulling out of the #IranDeal.

It also empowers hardliners in Iran and pushes that country even closer to Russia while further reducing US influence on the world stage (another Putin desire).
6359 2018-05-08 17:03:48 My friend dead ass just said “ I dropped my car off for an oil change, hopefully they get the rat out” 
6360 2018-05-08 17:03:45 like Iraq was accused of having nuclear weapons?
What happened to innocent until proven guilty?
I'm sure the fact it's a country with virtually untapped oil and gas fields is purely coincidental.
6361 2018-05-08 17:03:45 I'm a oil rich prince don't you know?
6362 2018-05-08 17:03:37 This war that is coming will greatly befit Putin and to some degree DJT and Bibi.  It will be a nice distraction so they can continue to rape America.  Also, SA will greatly benefit.  Oil prices will go very high again.  Anyone who has been following the media for the last few 1/
6363 2018-05-08 17:03:34 It's been for 2 yrs Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin plays an influential role in the KRG politics & oil sector, which isn't a good news for the US & EU, not for the people either as the KRG-US relations r vital for the Kurdish successes in Iraq.
6364 2018-05-08 17:03:27 I beg to differ. A country that recorded remarkable development in the past two regimes has its legislative body discussing cooking oil and sugar shortages cheerfully. That country must have wronged God somewhere sometimes.
6365 2018-05-08 17:03:25 *Breaking - Trump won't immediately withdraw from Iran deal but will apply sanctions
President Donald Trump is expected to announce he'll allow sanctions to go forward on Iran, in what CNN said is a "first step" toward withdrawing from the nuclear agr

6368 2018-05-08 17:03:03 Higher oil price. One man’s lose is another man’s gain. Oil is going to surge. Trump taking drastic decisions. Iran must be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons. We can’t have another Hitler’s Germany on our hands.
6369 2018-05-08 17:03:03 The oil portrait is still in the making @AlexandraPring, this one is a study in pastels. (My shoulder has really managed to slow me down..)

6375 2018-05-08 17:02:19 A classic example of a failed state. Oil industry destroyed, now is gold. Every facet of the economy is destroyed.

6383 2018-05-08 17:01:39 Oil Price obviously helps. Buys Assets cheap cos Big Oil wants Shale underneath and can't be bothered with Conventional Gas at surface. #DGOC proven operator. Cost of Barrel $7 so clearly no issue  !!! It's old fashioned Nodding Donkeys.

6385 2018-05-08 17:01:27 Well he just sent oil prices skyrocketing. By pulling out of the Iran deal. So ExxonMobil  and Gazprom and Rosneft and Lukoil are happy.
6386 2018-05-08 17:01:25 America is the worlds largest exporter of oil. Russians would like the price of natural gas to go up.
6387 2018-05-08 17:01:19 cc @benrhodes I agree, @LizMair ... Evangelicals get a big theological win and Deep State all-stars like Big Oil, the Defense Industry, the Saudis and the UAE get a huge financial win. Neocons and Netanyahu get a policy win. Many constituencies being served by Trump's move.

6414 2018-05-08 16:59:53 They're complying, and have cheaper oil.

We kill SA and russia's economy with one deal, as well as stop Iran from developing a Nuke.

It's a win win to stay in. The EU knows.
6415 2018-05-08 16:59:51 Waiting for this Iran announcement and watching the oil price. It kinda feels like Louis, Billy Ray, Randolph, and Mortimer waiting on the FCOJ crop report!
6416 2018-05-08 16:59:49 Yet, we don't see people defecting to save their lives here. Look at Venezuela all that oil and prosperous, now broke and a shell of what it once was
6417 2018-05-08 16:59:49 When he pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal, with NOTHING to replace it (as if he could replace a deal signed by US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China unilaterally), watch oil and gasoline prices to go way up.

6424 2018-05-08 16:59:19 80 oil sure would be nice to my portfolio. Yet Trump wants low oil prices... conundrum
6425 2018-05-08 16:59:14 Trump’s rationale: 1)  threat of sanctions reduces US companies’ desire to trade w/Iran, decreasing competition for Russian oil interests; 2) higher oil prices help Russian economy (30% of GDP); 3) inevitable war distracts from Mueller subpoenas. #IranDeal #TrumpRussia

6432 2018-05-08 16:58:36 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
6433 2018-05-08 16:58:33 Wow oil is a wild trade today
6434 2018-05-08 16:58:29 Best news for Putin because oil prices will go up. Our President betrayed American people again to do his master's bidding.
6435 2018-05-08 16:58:22 I use to put a couple drops of each in a water spray bottle when ds was little
I think the recipe I used was 6 drops each of lemongrass and citronella essential oil in 12 ounces distilled water. Sometimes added 2-4 drops of lavender as well
6436 2018-05-08 16:58:21 Running errands during lunch. Home Depot first. Couldn't find 40 grit discs for my sander. Now at Lube It All for overdue oil change. After this Chipotle for lunch
6437 2018-05-08 16:58:21 Like a self-fulfilling prophecy.Kill JCPOA,further weaken economy and thus Rohani,strengthen hardliners (instead of democratic opposition-whoever that is supposed to be),then play military card for self-defense.Nice side-effect:oil price goes up and US oil more competitive.Scary!
6438 2018-05-08 16:58:20 No we get what it meant to give Iran and Hezbollah 3 planes of cash barrels in unregistered notes. As we are on the verge of being number one oil exporters I believe that Trump know about oil don’t you?
6439 2018-05-08 16:58:20 Oh no people getting salty because Venezuela uses its oil (oil being another story) to help not its people but corporations get rich.
6440 2018-05-08 16:58:19 8 large Oil Tankers in Washington State between Port Angeles & Ferndale. No spills. All these ships transited Juan de Fuca close to Victoria.

Never chew fish oil capsules.

I'm not kidding there's fish oil inside.
IT'S FUCKING FISH OIL!!
6442 2018-05-08 16:57:59 Fixed the truck. And last week had to change the oil pressure censor on the wife's jeep because it was bad and losing oil pressure at the oil pressure censor, the irony
6443 2018-05-08 16:57:53 Dosa came with oil. LOL

IDIOTS
6444 2018-05-08 16:57:53 Duly noted. This is easily adopted to a pure veggie dish though. Just think olive oil scented garlic tater mash with a white wine garlic thyme sauce. The non vegetarian parts are not essential at all :)
6445 2018-05-08 16:57:49 Sir it's ok, what about oil prices day by day increasing, due to demonization half of the ATMs not working through out India,what about BLACK Money going...
6446 2018-05-08 16:57:43 IS BS WE HAVE PLENTY OF CRUDE THE $75 BARREL PHONY CREATED BY BIG OIL PRICE AT PUMP IS ALSO A LIE BY GREEDY LIEING BIG OIL IT’S ABOUT THE BIG FAT LIEING CORPORATE MONEY DEAL THAT OBAMA WALL STREET KERRY CONGRESS CORKER RYAN MCCONNELL GLOBALIST EUROPE MADE WITH IRANIAN CRIMINALS
6447 2018-05-08 16:57:40 On August 8, 1944, the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement was signed, dividing Middle Eastern oil between the US and the UK. Roosevelt said, "Persian oil... is yours. We share the oil of Iraq and Kuwait. As for Saudi Arabian oil, it's ours."
6448 2018-05-08 16:57:40 @GrandMarshalKimJongUn imho Iran won't impact stocks much economically. has temp effect on oil prices and that's it.
6449 2018-05-08 16:57:36 jdjss i just stopped tying my hair back....also massaging it w/ castor + vit e oil helps and i used 2 wash my hair everyday so i stopped doing that 
6450 2018-05-08 16:57:34 Yes. The EU are the snake oil peddlers.
6451 2018-05-08 16:57:16 Hopefully they start seriously researching the effects of CBD oil on arthritis.

6458 2018-05-08 16:56:41 He’s announcing that we are pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. Somewhat tongue in cheek comment but watch oil pricing after that.
6459 2018-05-08 16:56:40 All celebrities look like they’ve been waxed and covered in baby oil.
6460 2018-05-08 16:56:32 Came to work and forgot my debit card at home and I have to get an oil change after work  fml now I gotta go home first 
6461 2018-05-08 16:56:28 Crude oil prices are market controlled. Petrol prices are marked with high state taxes
6462 2018-05-08 16:56:27 Why has oil fallen?
6463 2018-05-08 16:56:26 そろそろ優勝できてもいいんですけどねー流行との兼ね合いが難しいです…！
6464 2018-05-08 16:56:09 Put too much oil on my dick in haste
6465 2018-05-08 16:55:54 IOTA's tangle is "best suited for IoT applications involving high-volume and high-frequency data -- from smart cities, energy, oil and gas, aerospace, and automotive," she pointed out.
6466 2018-05-08 16:55:52 I paid my bills and got my oil changed. 10/10 on the adulthood meter
6467 2018-05-08 16:55:45 Not to mention what this empowers OPEC to do with oil pricing on the sheer possibility of supply issues. $90/barrel in the next 60 days will do a lot to fill GOP mid-term coffers with petro-soft money. Can’t wait to be paying $5/gal next year. Oh and then that whole nuke thing...
6468 2018-05-08 16:55:35 What's your solution asshat? Invade Iran? Make Bolton's wet dreams a reality? I hate knowing that I'm living in a new age of crusades against Islam. Holy wars perpetrated for the sake of oil and money in the name of god and country. You are proof there is no god @realDonaldTrump

6471 2018-05-08 16:55:25 This time DT and Israel will go it alone in a war with Iran which is already prepared for war. Only the innocent lives which are going to be lost in a senseless war again like  Iraq. DT thinks he can win this war and take the oil from Iran as his own as if Iran will let him do it

6474 2018-05-08 16:55:08 When you go to get an oil change and they take your info down.. they take your car keys too. So they most likely have your house keys along with your address. Not a bad way to have someone else drive to your house as you don’t have a car and rob you 
6475 2018-05-08 16:55:07 Yeah, you are right. Literally every pro sports team on earth in a multi-billion dollar industry around sport science and prep are just throwing it away. Man City would've won before the oil money if they just got their head's right and mentality right.

6479 2018-05-08 16:54:45 DT pulls out of #IranDeal bc it wasn't good enough
Didn't include terrorizing 80M Iranians
Wasn't part of racist agenda of attacking everything a black Prez who was actually elected accomplished
Oil still wasn't high enough for Putin
Didn't yet include illegal bribes from Israel
6480 2018-05-08 16:54:26 Which benefits the world's largest crude oil producer (Russia)
6481 2018-05-08 16:54:25 Dari yang awal make itu nggak berasa sakit emangan? Iya begitu aja dulu pakein baby oil biar mendingan
6482 2018-05-08 16:54:25 Iran about to make a load of money on the Oil market. I like low gas prices coming
6483 2018-05-08 16:54:24 @geography_411 However, Russia has adopted a western style management for their oil industry that has helped them expand since the early twenty first century
6484 2018-05-08 16:54:20 2 PM US time...oil and shares will react post that
6485 2018-05-08 16:54:19 Perhaps all he can think of is how happy Vlad will be when the price of oil rises.
6486 2018-05-08 16:54:12 I see oil prices are fluctuating wildly today as Trump's decision on the #IranDeal is clouded in mystery.

That must be great for those in the know, in his circle, that can make a tidy fortune today from the uncertainty.

#CronyCapitalism
6487 2018-05-08 16:54:11 It's about more than gasoline and diesel isn't it? Everything from clothes to plastics uses oil in some form. Pipelines are safer in my opinion than using rail or trucks.

6490 2018-05-08 16:53:22 เด้วก็คงลืมแหละ
6491 2018-05-08 16:53:17 He is pulling out because Russia will benefit with more oil sales.  Saudi Arabia and Israel will benefit because if there is a war to break out or if Iran becomes weakened than they will become more powerful in the region.
6492 2018-05-08 16:53:15 Buy oil now

6512 2018-05-08 16:51:10 It's not just about reversing everything Obama did. Putin wants the Iran deal killed so Russian oil can be more competitive, among other things.
6513 2018-05-08 16:51:06 Trump's “accomplishment” is propping up oil prices with the threat of global instability and undermining collective global actions. Not really in the majority of American's best interest but it sure helps Moscow.
6514 2018-05-08 16:51:05 Grow it put the Jamaican castor oil and flourish

6517 2018-05-08 16:50:57 Yes, you're right, this government is too busy trying to help America get the oil from Syria that they have forgotten about their own people, I thought charity begins at home, I suppose Tories think that money is more important.
6518 2018-05-08 16:50:46 This just more deconstruction Bannon continues to direct. It’s not just about Obama. It’s about war. Trump wants a war. He also wants oil. It will be interesting to see the extent to which Russia’s oil industry (in other words, Putin) will benefit from sanctions on Iran.

6522 2018-05-08 16:50:39 Buy stocks in oil? This seems like another CON from @realDonaldTrump to help his rich buddies and himself. #twump probably just told his broker to buy low, sell high. #FakePresidentREALCONMAN
6523 2018-05-08 16:50:39 So will #US sanction #China for buying oil from #Iran?
6524 2018-05-08 16:50:37 This explanation does not address key issues such as the huge amounts of foreign money being used to keep our oil landlocked or the fact that the vast majority of FN's enroute have approved and are benefiting from agreements from KM. Why does the MSM ignore these facts?
6525 2018-05-08 16:50:34 No need to shout with CAPS. I'd be very concerned about long term oil price trends if I shared your view. Big move to renewables in Europe as well as market volatility leaves Scotland v exposed if that is the anchor for state income. Eggs and baskets...
6526 2018-05-08 16:50:30 Those who are worry about your decision are ONLY worry for their own business they have in IRAN and the oil prices. Money drives their minds.

6534 2018-05-08 16:49:56 A spike in oil prices this summer and/or a war no one wants should really help the GOP hang onto Congress.

6537 2018-05-08 16:49:41 Well maintained cars are safer cars, so it’s important to make sure you change your oil on a regular basis. Regular inspections are also important to make sure that all the parts of your car (engine to tires) are working properly.

6539 2018-05-08 16:49:34 If Trump pulls out of the #IranDeal, the price of oil will go up instantly. 
Hey, MAGA, folks! Please tell your President to not pull out of the Iran deal? 
Oh, Nevermind! You guys don't get what impact it would have on the nation.

6551 2018-05-08 16:49:00 @chrislhayes Consider this: if Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, oil supplies will substantially diminish, prices will skyrocket and Trump’s Russian and American “friends” will make boatloads of money.

6555 2018-05-08 16:48:45 Trump hated the deal because it was Obama's, and getting out gives him his best chance to wage some kind of war.  You don't bring in Bolton and make Pompeo SoS because peace is your priority.  Oh, and don't forget: "take the oil."
6556 2018-05-08 16:48:23 Trump pulling out of the #IranDeal shouldn't surprise nobody now the oil prices will increased dramatically due to this.

Who wants CHAOS in the Middle East????

EVERY NATION SITTING ON OIL RESERVES!!!!!

They want YOU to pay $100 barrel for oil or more because they get rich! 

HELLO WAKE UP AMERICA YOU ARE BEING PLAYED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!!
6561 2018-05-08 16:47:55 So many of you here don’t care if Iran gets its nukes, as long as the price of oil is low, correct?
6562 2018-05-08 16:47:53 If your goal is to undermine your upcoming talks with NK by showing yourself to be an untrustworthy party, then it makes complete sense.  If the goal is to drive the price of oil up, which is a key Russian goal, then it makes complete sense. 

Stop assuming you know the why.
6563 2018-05-08 16:47:44 why so cruel? 

I like eating shit. They're so delicious and have a lot of protein and oil. I like them fried, or dried, or better yet grilled.
6564 2018-05-08 16:47:40 He bombed Syria for using chemical weapons while rejecting any of them as refugees trying to escape that regime and the chemical weapon attacks. And the other 3 you listed are bullshit talking points anyways. God do trumpsters love buying snake oil.

6566 2018-05-08 16:47:22 We're currently at $1.30 / L . Gotta love a country with loads of oil ships it to the states to refine and buy back . Lol
6567 2018-05-08 16:47:22 If oil can stay mid 60s to low 70s we will be in good shape. We dont need oil really high for these energy names to unlock their value.

6569 2018-05-08 16:47:19 Lmao - I know a lot smarter people than you or trump ,in many countries , decided this was the best option . Trump just wants to act tough and hand out profits to oil and defense companies
6570 2018-05-08 16:47:10 ATTENTION CONSUMERS:  Fill your gas tank right now.  Speculators on Wall Street are going to use Trump's actions on the Iran deal to spike oil futures.  Of course the price of fuel 6 mos. down the road, will be reflected today!
6571 2018-05-08 16:47:09 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, here is Spiritual advice: We the people doesn't need to Import oil from the Middle East, when the United States of America can Drill Our Own Oil in the Gulf of Mexico, it would be Much Cheaper and Less Expensive! In God We Trust!
6572 2018-05-08 16:47:07 I think it’s super important you’re telling your story. You probably know about this already but have you checked into CBD oil?  One called Charlotte’s web NFL guys are using. It’s legal to ship b/c it’s classified as hemp oil. It’s used for different illnesses/pain/headaches too
6573 2018-05-08 16:47:06 On a car that's front wheel drive, the front wheels accelerate, steer and help brake. Front tires tend to wear down quicker than rear. Make sure you get them rotated with every oil change!
6574 2018-05-08 16:47:03 Placing an oil trade on a CNN headline sounds like a horrible idea to me!
6575 2018-05-08 16:47:00 or you can melt the coconut oil, add some tumeric and you will have whitened your teeth.  It's messy but it works. Use glass container & old shirt b/c tumeric stains everything except your teeth. It does work.

6577 2018-05-08 16:46:58 I also sometimes put Frankinsence oil directly but only 2 or three batches then wait a bit . Frankinsence can give you a rash if you use directly for too long. Essential oils are very underrated but Im finding them to be the most powerful.
6578 2018-05-08 16:46:41 get her some baby oil
6579 2018-05-08 16:46:36 Just ordered another bottle of @SlicksJohnny Beard Oil. It smells great, it makes my beard softer. If you have a beard you NEED this product. I'll never use a different brand again.
6580 2018-05-08 16:46:36 Fuck gas. Invest in alternative energy research and development.  Most our oil comes from the US anyway. We're tearing up our country for it.  Focus on what really matters.
6581 2018-05-08 16:46:24 Today's perfume oil includes Teakwood, Bamboo, Sweet Orange, Peppermint, Rosemary and Magnolia. I'm going to call the combo "Wood Sprite."
6582 2018-05-08 16:46:19 Twin cam engine upgrade.  58mm throttle body, gear drive easy start cams, new lifters, pushrods, oil pump and cam support plate. All followed up with a remap on our rolling road.
6583 2018-05-08 16:46:15 Lol remember a year or two years ago wey beard oil they move for market, cos babes swear say na bearded niggas them love
6584 2018-05-08 16:46:04 Does this mean that we won't be destroying their and other wildlife habitats by opening protected lands for mining and oil drilling as planned by Trump and the Republican Congress? Hmm???

6587 2018-05-08 16:45:55 Trump tearing up Iran nuclear agreement

Isn't about tearing up the agreement
It's reinstating sanctions against Iran

Now let your mind wander through the attendant benefits to Russia (oligarchs) & US oil Corps

Ignore the nuclear angle for a sec

AND ALL is suddenly explained
6588 2018-05-08 16:45:52 Fresh haircut, fresh oil change, fresh outta school, my boi finna be pullin all the hoes lol
6589 2018-05-08 16:45:48 Trump promised the oil oligarchs (and Putin) he'd do this.
6590 2018-05-08 16:45:48 We're seeing companies consider these things as they operate their businesses. This morning, Royal Duch Shell announced a sale of their stake in oil sands operations, in line with an effort to cut emissions. Shell will keep its stake in bitumen upgrader Syncrude.

6593 2018-05-08 16:45:25 Olive oil caresses the soul
6594 2018-05-08 16:45:23 It also benefits the Russians, who need oil above $55 in order to make a profit.
6595 2018-05-08 16:45:19 Interior is now of the oil, by the oil, for the oil. Just saying. #SaveKansas

6598 2018-05-08 16:45:11 There are many layers to this deal... Economically, we pull out oil could potentially rise, and this could threaten the NK deal which Trump has harped on if he goes through with it. You'd essentially be back where you started several years ago. No reason to pull out really...
6599 2018-05-08 16:45:09 In a time when gas prices have hit a 3 year high... and look to go much higher after Trump reneges on the #IranDeal... it is insanity to oppose better fuel efficiency standards (unless you are in the pocket of big oil).

6600 2018-05-08 16:45:07 There are things that are well spelt out in the Constitution for the president to enjoy a luxurious life but some people r against it because they want PMB to be fanning or changing his car's engine oil himself at the Villa because someone in Keffi or Sapele will get mad!.Issokay
6601 2018-05-08 16:44:45 The christian woman most probably has family in the army who drove the muslim womans family into poverty through war. Oil was the goal and now the muslim women is a warrior because her way of life was stripped from her. Two extremes. One is ignorant. One is tired of oppression.

6603 2018-05-08 16:44:27 #IranDeal trump gonna pull out if the deal and gas prices will jump to $4 dollars a gallon because we buy oil from Iran because it's a big  oil producing state ...oh wait nevermind
6604 2018-05-08 16:44:18 Thats fine - agree to disagree. But I feel I laid it out for u pretty clear

No other CME market is used as the main source of revenue for an individual except the Ag space 

Banks use Treasuries. Oil corporations use WTI. Joe the farmer uses Corn. 

Hence the difference
6605 2018-05-08 16:44:10 If u could go back in time 30 years & protect all the areas offshore NL where there has be oil development, would you do it?
6606 2018-05-08 16:44:04 And as oil prices surge, Putin wins, as always.
6607 2018-05-08 16:44:03 The Saudis are far worse but then we buy their oil and they buy our military hardware...

6609 2018-05-08 16:43:37 @realDonaldTrump Please stay with Iran deal so Oil prices don't go up. Gas is at all time high and will go higher is you stop it. OPEC is holding back barrels so price will go up.
Thank you.
6610 2018-05-08 16:43:35 Well, no matter how badly daddy screws up with his completely irresponsible leaving of the Iran deal he doesn't understand, we still have Jr.'s hair to use for oil reserves when we can't afford gas anymore.
6611 2018-05-08 16:43:33 Biggest benefit, once again, may go to Russia. They get to look like the good guy while benefiting hugely from a) higher oil prices b) competitors for Iranian market bound by sanctions and c) Iran becomes more of a Russian ally.
6612 2018-05-08 16:43:30 Oil especially with the vq35, I have to check my 350z oil regularly and it’s just my daily. I add oil usually every other week

6625 2018-05-08 16:42:14 Would love to. What ever happened to those high speed rail projects Obama was pushing for? Oh yeah, R congress killed them out of spite and to keep the oil barons donating.
6626 2018-05-08 16:42:06 Well, it looks like we'll have a period of $4.00 per gallon gas between now and the election. The price will come down before the election, but hopefully the oil companies are greedy enough to keep it up long enough for people to remember.
6627 2018-05-08 16:41:59 I know , I keep hearing, that we have enough natural gas,, and oil under our feet, that we could be #1 in production, Why aren't we ??
6628 2018-05-08 16:41:51 Zero mention of what I consider to be the most important issue: the impact on climate change from increased carbon emissions from burning exported Tar Sands oil (which Canada's emissions targets do NOT include)
6629 2018-05-08 16:41:40 So we're giving Iran nukes for oil, which should be an outdated source of energy if they properly funded and supported science?
6630 2018-05-08 16:41:36 ERA is committing more than $70 million to these nine projects from the ERA #OilSands Innovation Challenge, and the projects are valued at more than $720 million. These technologies will help #Alberta meet the provincial climate leadership oil sands emissions limit.

6635 2018-05-08 16:41:21 Probably will also make his pal Putin a lot of money when oil prices go up.
6636 2018-05-08 16:41:16 It wasn't enough, and it only targeted the oil industry.

6644 2018-05-08 16:40:40 Imposing sanctions and getting out of the deal supports & aids our enemies.  Now there is nothing.  And they said that they will not renegotiate.  What this does is bring division along European allies which benefits Russia.  Oil prices will now go up which benefits the Saudis.

6651 2018-05-08 16:40:17 #irandeal I wonder how much Money Traitor Trump is receiving from Russia over this deal? Russian Oil will be making Billions!
6652 2018-05-08 16:40:12 1/ The maturity date of 05/12 is only a small bit of the #Irandeal as set by the Congress in 2011 (sanctions against foreign oil importers). So, it leaves a bit of discretion to save the Iran deal. As a result, there are two types of scenarios:

6654 2018-05-08 16:40:10 They will, because the EU wants the cheaper oil. Meanwhile trump will help his buddies in Saudi Arabia screw at twice the price. Its all about the 
6655 2018-05-08 16:40:06 Been using oils for some years now. I don’t buy face moisturizer anymore. Im a raw shea butter, coconut oil, castor oil, jojoba oil mixed all in one type of girl.
6656 2018-05-08 16:40:06 Will oil spike to $100 plus if Trump overturns the Iran nuclear deal
6657 2018-05-08 16:39:59 Pres Trump- Why don't face the TV & tell World what this is all about.  All about money... World is going to Gold Standard & US may collapse, the need for world power drives America to tap into Syrian oil...the last oil reserve on Earth & the biggest... God says Need before Greed
6658 2018-05-08 16:39:58 that's why we need to get off oil.  No other country can impact our energy source
6659 2018-05-08 16:39:50 No it wont you silly man, Iran only supply's a very small amount of oil to the states lol
6660 2018-05-08 16:39:44 Appreciate the sentiment behind your statement however...In all honesty...Gas should never be this expensive regardless. The United States, due to Pres Obama's efforts, is less dependent on foreign oil than ever before in history of our country...the price gouging is domestic!!!
6661 2018-05-08 16:39:43 Because Big Oil has never ruined any governments or countries right? Any.
6662 2018-05-08 16:39:41 Well that’s you though lol. just like how women oil themselves up to make themselves look edible or more attractive? it’s more of a fetish honestly. but that’s my opinion.
6663 2018-05-08 16:39:28 The sanctions shall only add insult to injury: Iran was able to trade with European companies and Boeing as a part of the deal. Trump's withdrawal and imposing of sanctions could begin a tit-for-tat scenario wherein Iran reduces its oil exports...
6664 2018-05-08 16:39:12 Wouldn't it be neat if Iran said that they'll continue to abide by the agreement because they believe the current  American government is illegitimate and also batshit crazy. But alas, there are economic consequences that they must respond to. Good bye low oil prices. Hello war.
6665 2018-05-08 16:39:07 Agreed :)  I was giving Mr. Crosby a hard time.   Music is the oil that keeps the world turning!

6666 2018-05-08 16:38:44 The phase out plan is to squash the Canadian Oil industry which produces oil at the highest ethical and environmental standards in the world? Sounds like a terrible plan to me.
6667 2018-05-08 16:38:35 Biggest benefit, once again, may go to Russia. They get to look like the good guy while benefiting hugely from a) higher oil prices b) competitors for Iranian market bound by sanctions and c) Iran becomes more of a Russian ally.
6668 2018-05-08 16:38:30 All about Russia and oil! trump doesn’t care about the fallout as long as he and his Oligarch buddies continue to make money!
6669 2018-05-08 16:38:28 High oil prices mean a lot of money for the upper 10% in America , but kills the middle class and small business by depleating their budgets on fuel
6670 2018-05-08 16:38:27 This moron knows nothing and doesn’t care. How does this benefit us?  It just creates another crisis and will make oil prices skyrocket.  This is beyond comprehension.
6671 2018-05-08 16:38:20 Sharp fall in the price of oil suggests Trump's decision on Trump already leaked. Oil price over $2 lower currently. #oilprice
6672 2018-05-08 16:38:13 Syria...oil. if the US would pivot to green energy, we wouldn't need to be involved over these fossil fuel transport issues. Sigh...

6674 2018-05-08 16:37:53 someone replied to "some men should give their jobs up for women" with "yes they should give up all those oil rig jobs"

and like, apparently they reduced oil rig deaths by teach men how to fucking communicate their feelings, so maybe???
6675 2018-05-08 16:37:48 Macri ajusta y en el 2020 con oil a 120 y commodities arriba agarran los peronchos. No salimos más de este ciclo de mierda.
6676 2018-05-08 16:37:46 Driving up oil prices would also help Russia, I believe.
6677 2018-05-08 16:37:44 But Vova Putin needs more cash for his oil and gas so the US #MAGA crew just have to suck up $5.00 per gallon gas.  They knew they were just being used. Now they get to pay for it.
6678 2018-05-08 16:37:43 It's always the details that matter isn't it?

Was it his oil drilling policies that brought us back?  Wait no that just happened in spite of him

Was it shoveling things of money to solar companies that failed? Nope

How about containing ISIS, NK? Nope 

It was dead cat bounce

6686 2018-05-08 16:36:48 What will now happen to the majority of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck and gas prices spike because of cancellation of the #IranDeal . Is @realDonaldTrump going to call for oil price freezes and gas price freezes? Every action has consequences.
6687 2018-05-08 16:36:47 re: Iran Nuke capability. Forget France and Germany who have no oil and facing an eventual civil war due to the rabbit like Muslim birthrate. Trump should pull out of the one sided Iran BS and then pile on some really nasty financial sanctions till they wise up. @Varneyco
6688 2018-05-08 16:36:35 putin runs a mafia regime (according to the anti mafia unit of italy and european secret services).
their interest is survival. and part of that is to destabalize the west. and oil prices above 80 dollars.

6693 2018-05-08 16:36:15 It's important to have your brakes checked AT LEAST once every six months, but it is better to have them looked at each time you get an oil change to make sure everything is in working order. Keep your vehicle in tip-top shape with a call to us today - (843) 293-5551
6694 2018-05-08 16:35:52 Would it be far fetched to see oil price drops reflecting at the gas pump anytime soon..?

6698 2018-05-08 16:35:43 Couldn't agree more. It's come to the point where he's making decisions based on his own lies, endangering not just Americans but people all over the world. And he's driving up the price of oil in the process.
6699 2018-05-08 16:35:33 A record number of longs in crude futures set-up for a wild day in Oil.  Expect Trump to effectively end the Iran deal but not practically.  Don't expect much action in Treasuries, but expect a rebound by the end of the day. #loanlogics @loanlogics
6700 2018-05-08 16:35:32 Will pulling out of this deal cause oil prices to soar?
6701 2018-05-08 16:35:30 Did people suddenly get very stupid this year?

The South Carolina John Crouch is getting an oil change. The New York John Crouch is getting a new Weber Grill. The Colorado John Crouch is getting a new mattress. The New Mexico John Crouch retired and put my email in his farewell
6702 2018-05-08 16:35:27 "PEAK" meme speak trending 14 Yrs cycle! What happened to "regime change?" Do you like what they teach do like what they preach? Buzz Words! What are they selling? PEAK OIL? #InsanityReigns

On a liter  your bridge reminds me of the drive in movies! What picture are we showing?
6703 2018-05-08 16:35:25 We dont trust oil companies or conservatives to be part of the phase out solution.
6704 2018-05-08 16:35:25 @JohnKingCNN Sowing doubt about & withdrawing from the Iran agreement raises oil prices. Is there any chance that @realDonaldTrump is to doing a favor for US & Russian oil producers?
6705 2018-05-08 16:35:21 It’s wrong that being a girl is so easy bc I’ve never had to pay for an oil change at my car dealer when it should be at least $40 each time but this guy always hooks me up
6706 2018-05-08 16:35:20 I went to the UPS store at 3945 Forbes Ave in Pittsburgh, PA to ship a 24" x 26" oil painting to my brother in Los Angeles. The clerk somehow dropped a glob of black ink on the painting and then wouldn't help me clean it. Now it is stained permanently. Painting was worth $800.
6707 2018-05-08 16:35:13 WTI oil at $70/barrel, -0.71.

6709 2018-05-08 16:35:06 Letting the professionals at Wetzone Car Wash clean your car is a more environmentally friendly option. Home car washing pollutes the environment as soap, oil, tar, and dirt end up in storm sewers that flow into lakes, streams, and rivers.
6710 2018-05-08 16:35:06 @RepRooney Term limits definitely needed! Natural gas and oil moves for Europe and to check Russia also logical moves. I hope you will gain support for both of these moves
6711 2018-05-08 16:34:57 Plus, by raising the Price of Oil he makes Putin and Trump's friends in the Middle East richer. Follow the $$$
6712 2018-05-08 16:34:57 #Netanyahu says #Iran deploying arms in #Syria to threaten #Israel - 2 - Netanyahu, you make yourself suspicious as your utter comes hours before #Trump's decision announcement. You are throwing oil on a fire you have ignited.
6713 2018-05-08 16:34:55 Desperately seeking huge canvas, affordable, oil paintings of Bowie portraits/album covers to put the finishing touches on my new home. Sources?
6714 2018-05-08 16:34:52 Market Trading Hours Summary: Oil prices slip ahead of looming Iran nuclear decision 
Bond yields rose, pushing  US 10yr towards 3% after the JOLTS data hit another all-time high.
6715 2018-05-08 16:34:39 #Russian President has invited KRG PM Barzani through the chief executive of Russia's oil giant #Rosneft, Barzani will meet President #Putin today. KRG has already received loans from Rosneft & Rosneft has started huge investment in KRG oil sector, controlling KRG oil pipeline.
6716 2018-05-08 16:34:32 Like your work @chartsmarter.  I asked about one of my favorite oil exploration companies @CRZO some time ago.  Would you have a look since earnings are out?
6717 2018-05-08 16:34:30 Seems nearly impossible to stop a nation with will & resources from acquiring nukes. DPRK did despite near-global isolation. Can't help thinking Trump's move is intended to oil slippery slope to conflict. He's giving Iran option to stay in w/Europe & score good guy points.
6718 2018-05-08 16:34:15 Her Motor Gone seize Up If She Don’t Put Some oil in That shit lol
6719 2018-05-08 16:34:12 โคตรชอบเลยพี่มันส์สุดดด ร๊ากกกกกเลย!!!!!!
6720 2018-05-08 16:34:07 So you are also saying the U.S should stop propping up Oil and Coal as well? And the big 3 should not have been bailed out in 2008?
6721 2018-05-08 16:34:06 Last time we did a regime change, we deposed a democratic leader and put in the Shah. He was a tyrant! Revolution deposed him and made Iran our enemy. All because we wanted to control their oil!
6722 2018-05-08 16:33:59 My sister these guys are going to hell fire certainly. My friend mum just died of dm ketoacidosis. She was relatively stable on her drugs before they con her to by anointing oil. For good 3mths she abandon her drug & DM clinic. The havoc this man of devil is doing is much.
6723 2018-05-08 16:33:54 @dailypriceaction  further room to grow from the bottom there

6724 2018-05-08 16:33:39 5 You prepare a table before me

You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
forever.
6725 2018-05-08 16:33:36 VPD = snake oil you mean?

6731 2018-05-08 16:32:49 Oil is hovering around $70 a barrel now .:.was at about $40 a barrel when the Obama regime was in .. so plunging?
6732 2018-05-08 16:32:28 Thank you @SecretarySonny for your work to defend corn farmers and the RFS against attacks from Big Oil. Farm income is declining. Rural America can’t afford to lose ethanol markets. #RFSworks
6733 2018-05-08 16:32:26 The US government is an Oil/Arms company with an army of mercenaries. You can predict their actions based in this premise.

6735 2018-05-08 16:32:06 Need to film a new video for mynaughtyselfies, but also waiting for a delivery.. don’t think opening the door mid video covered in oil will be the best idea  video will have to wait!
6736 2018-05-08 16:32:06 Everything improving aerodynamic is welcome...hope there won't be any objections even this time (mirrors, oil, etc...)
Yes, the logo is very very nice!
6737 2018-05-08 16:31:58 Oil prices will go up instantly if trump pulls out of the deal.
#IranDeal
6738 2018-05-08 16:31:56 So oil & gas companies raise prices because of something that may or may not happen then slowly lower prices when the imagined disaster passes since $billions in annual profits isn't enough for them.
6739 2018-05-08 16:31:56 15yrs of growing pains. LOL who's myopic here?

DREAM ON on the promises of FAIL. just a little more time (and money).... 

my thinking is way beyond snake oil shit e-cars that are about to be taken out by profitable automakers.
6740 2018-05-08 16:31:55 Tell me how social programs in Venezuela led to oil price collapse. Or what on earth Greece has to do with anything  Cuba has actually done pretty well, so considering the blockade as well, for a developing nation it's done good
6741 2018-05-08 16:31:43 Just saw a #Tesla with the license plate "LOL OIL".
6742 2018-05-08 16:31:41 Have to wonder if our EU allies will see Trump as another REpublican leader taking America's kids back into another Mid East war to finally get his oil based on lies like Iraq as a huge NO Way Not Again. & American Mothers seeing this same way too. Trump/GOP will own this killing
6743 2018-05-08 16:31:39 ชอบพี่ผมยาวๆ
6744 2018-05-08 16:31:36 That extra $8 a pay check will go real far at the pump. Oil companies got billion dollar tax breaks and now they're gonna get your $8 too.
6745 2018-05-08 16:31:30 LOL! I just copped Cooper tone sport...hopefully it doesn’t do that to me bc I needs the oil! I got the spray kind tho
6746 2018-05-08 16:31:27 I know you need an export license for artifacts and wood carvings (eg Federal Palace Hotel Tourist Stall will give you) but not for prints, ink drawings, drawings or oil paintings purchased in Nigeria.
6747 2018-05-08 16:31:19 Ok. Something got lost in the translation! My apologies. I completely agree. Ran my own painting business, albeit on the side, as did my dad. He used to boil linseed oil and mixed in lead and pigment—all without protection. Overreach by government and exaggerated danger.
6748 2018-05-08 16:31:18 Dumb money going long while smart money going short oil
6749 2018-05-08 16:31:16 Iran is a major oil producer.  Imposing sanctions on them limits world supply, thereby forcing up prices.  Oil prices have already gone up in anticipation of him reimposing sanctions.
6750 2018-05-08 16:31:15 Of course 2 wrongs and all that but Lab/Con should be like oil and water. Labour in Scotland are giving the sticks for the snp to beat them with continually. It alienated a lot of folk like me from the party I should be voting for
6751 2018-05-08 16:31:07 Oh!  A rise in crude oil prices.  Yet another benefit for Putin and the Oligarchs.
Good Donnie!  Who’s a good boy?  Donnie’s a good boy!!
6752 2018-05-08 16:31:06 Rib eye, arugula, piave, salt, pepper, top quality olive oil on Italian bread with a splash of aged balsamic.
6753 2018-05-08 16:31:02 Yesterday I figured out how to change my oil on my own for the first time so TAKE THAT DAD
6754 2018-05-08 16:30:59 I can totally cook cannabis butter or oil but I’m too lazy and it takes forever.
6755 2018-05-08 16:30:57 Sobre o acordo nuclear com Irã. Seguinte... Pedra Preta está comprada em futuros de Oil. O que irá sair do acordo não sei, mas a tensão está elevada.
6756 2018-05-08 16:30:57 You forgot the Radiation since the 1st Atomic Bomb,  The Ozone Layer, The Pesticides in ground, water and food,   Fukushima, The Oil spills, The Plastic Island in the Ocean, yes we are acting like parasites, but Agenda 21 will solve that unless we chose to change.
6757 2018-05-08 16:30:54 we are warned in the bible that only half of the church prepared for the Groom to be late in His coming. not just a spiritual call to cleanup. virgins were already clean. oil and supplies. things to live on. only gonna get darker. lots and lots of oil.
6758 2018-05-08 16:30:46 We know it was their money!
That's not the point.
They don't get to choose to "re-start" a NUCLEAR weapons program on the sly when they've proven all they do is yell death to America and send ppl to kill us.
 We pay Big bucks on oil ANYWAY at the whim of the big wigs. So what?
6759 2018-05-08 16:30:45 ไม่รู้เลย ว่าควรรสยังไง
6760 2018-05-08 16:30:37 China wins. They get cheaper oil and will partner on the future of Iran.
6761 2018-05-08 16:30:34 I think oil is animal since it’s mostly zooplankton. It’s also got algae in it - neither plant nor animal. Def not mineral tho petroleum means rock oil.

6763 2018-05-08 16:30:20 The US pulling out of the Iran deal would be a major win for Putin on two levels. First, it drives a wedge between the US and Europe, which is a major policy goal. Second, it raises the price of oil, which is huge for a major petro-state. A true win-win.
6764 2018-05-08 16:30:12 The @EIAgov's forecast for 2019 US crude oil production in today's just-released STEO of 11.86 million b/d is 1.01 million b/d higher than its forecast in the January STEO #OOTT
6765 2018-05-08 16:30:08 So will Texas and Oklahoma's oil industry, as well as the Koch's refinery business. Tremendous bonanza for Republican donor class.  Funny, isn't it, how often their interests and values align with those of Putin, isn't it?
6766 2018-05-08 16:30:08 Sent my pops pics I took yesterday he's called me asking why I'm skin lightening (bleaching) I told him I'm using filters. Old man legit told me, '' I've heard people who have died by applying filter ''  he thinks it's some type of oil.

Oil algos paralyzed amid barrage of fake news.
6769 2018-05-08 16:29:59 Why? If everyone else stays in it likely has little to no effect on Iran. The only thing that might happen is an increase oil prices. Conservatives are so far up their ass on this one it literally boggles the mind
6770 2018-05-08 16:29:53 Indeed we have. Crazy what this has done to the oil market, too.
6771 2018-05-08 16:29:49 I always avoid buying framed paintings. I just buy oil on canvas and it is easy to roll up and fit into a suitcase.
6772 2018-05-08 16:29:47 Im just saying thats how Iran fucks with USA & everyone else is by threatening to shut down the Straight of Hormuz! & if things got really bad! All they really have to do if blow up a huge Oil Tanker & it would be months b4 anything could be transported through there!
6773 2018-05-08 16:29:26 Essential oil‘s is not a bath.
6774 2018-05-08 16:29:26 I cannot believe
that meaness
was me-ness this whole time
but with too many letters
6775 2018-05-08 16:29:23 The next step by Iran will be to stop pricing Oil in US $

You read it here first.
6776 2018-05-08 16:28:58 Conference call was some what positive. All hedges off by 2019 & are reduced each 1/4 going forward. Billion in revenues coming in annually and profitable soon. As long as oil stays up the next few 1/4’s their situation will improve.
6777 2018-05-08 16:28:48 #IfRahulBecomesPM Youth will get jobs, farmers will get their loans waived, Indian people will get cheap oil Business, Small Industry, traders will flourish common man bank accounts will have balance to live respectable lives.
6778 2018-05-08 16:28:47 #irandeal Fuck Russian oil and fuck Comrade Donald Trump!
6779 2018-05-08 16:28:35 Isn't this a bit like giving a child extra pocket money for not tormenting the cat and hitting baby sister? Conservatives will find ANY excuse to give oil companies taxpayers' money. I'd tell Erin O'Toole this but he #ConBlocked me for criticising Harper's policies re: veterans.
6780 2018-05-08 16:28:34 Castor oil. Rub it in every day, or multiple times a day. Look it up, it's fantastic. Yes, very oily unfortunately. But it really helps....I have a serious pain disorder called CRPS & Fibromyalgia. Also, peppermint oil. Topically.
6781 2018-05-08 16:28:26 Just got out the Drs office, it's my thyroid and my triglycerides are very high. Have to take fish oil and synthroid. Thanks to all for prayers!
6782 2018-05-08 16:28:17 Putin and Trump make deal to get Trump elected, Trump receives large cut of Russian-owned oil company, Trump gets elected, dismantles EPA and takes out the competition in other oil-rich nations. 2020 Trump retires with his fat Cayman Islands account. ... How close am I?
6783 2018-05-08 16:27:59 A cautionary tale, My wife has a friend who is also an #ICUNurse who was  fired, for testing positive for #Marijuana,the problem is she doesn't ingest or smoke #Marijuana,however she does take hemp oil supplements! Which are not supposed to test +,second test was -! Still fired!
6784 2018-05-08 16:27:45 Well that pretty much nails it square on the head! Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal will drive oil sky high, resulting in tremendous profit for Russia!
6785 2018-05-08 16:27:45 Money. Especially when oil is involved. Plus, the added bonus of wagging the dog.
6786 2018-05-08 16:27:42 For Oil & Gas, just read 3 books 
(1) Oil 101 by Morgan (Basics)
(2) Deutsche Bank Primer on Oil (2013) - Equity research perspective
(3) Energy Markets by Vincent Kempinski (Bible about Energy)
6787 2018-05-08 16:27:41 @wef any forums related to Kenya oil exploration and its impact to the youths in the coming few years ? @TullowOilplc @moscakenya @TurkanaCountyKE #OilExploration
6788 2018-05-08 16:27:39 for sure they love the higher oil prices, the overall chaos and the alienation between the us and europe.
6789 2018-05-08 16:27:29 I need a deep tissue massage. Just massaged my boobs with baby oil and it felt amazing. I just need someone to repeat the routine all over my body 
6790 2018-05-08 16:27:23 I happen to have been bullish oil, but damn, everything mentioned here is eyeroll-worthy.

Commodities twitter is another area filled with "Right for the wrong reasons"

Oil over black pencil, and graph paper
6792 2018-05-08 16:27:20 I fully expect @realDonaldTrump to blow the Iran deal. The reason is oil. Iran has huge quantities of reserves which will be released to the market which would bring down the price of oil should we honor the terms of the agreement. Putin doesn't want that.
6793 2018-05-08 16:27:18 “We’re going to need something sharper if we want to reach that oil before the event starts.”
6794 2018-05-08 16:27:18 I am sure they meant 165 odd crores and not the number of crores they have quoted :) BTW, a static surveillance post stopped me and checked my car. The only thing they got was an engine oil can.
6795 2018-05-08 16:27:11 Also a breathtaking financial windfall for Russia as their oil becomes more competitive due to sanctions being placed back on Iran. Banner day for Putin.

6801 2018-05-08 16:26:57 I would like to believe that since he could vote his conscience and is now apolitical; he did the right thing
6802 2018-05-08 16:26:55 i almost just put my eggs into the pan without heating up the pan at all or putting olive oil
6803 2018-05-08 16:26:54 Pulling out of #IranDeal will drive up oil prices... which benefits who? Billionaire Texans & Saudis.

And if that scuttles any nuclear deal w/ North Korea, who benefits? Billionaire arms dealers, that's who.

Nice going, billionaire nihilists! Your GOP investment's paying off!
6804 2018-05-08 16:26:52 Oil prices & Gas way up and @realDonaldTrump wants to fight Iran.
6805 2018-05-08 16:26:51 *points at car*
"this is janis. she runs on sunflower oil and good vibes"
6806 2018-05-08 16:26:44 Never listen to what Trump says.  Just watch what he does and its predictable results: Iran gets a bomb. Russia gets higher oil prices. Arab states & Turkey get basis for building their own bombs supplied by TrumpFamily/Putin joint venture. 
That was Flynn's plan. @FBIWFO @WHNSC
6807 2018-05-08 16:26:36 Its not just about our Oil coming through the Straight of Hormuz its everyones! Its not just about the price of USA oil prices! Again anytime they threaten to shut it down our carrier fleet is on the way!
6808 2018-05-08 16:26:31 Russia is an oil state most people still are very poor. Higher oil prices help Putin and the oligarchs.
6809 2018-05-08 16:26:29 For womb healing, Naree's products are amazing. @KushFruit I'll use the yoni oil, then the next day have a breakthrough. Shadow work is no joke either. And I go thru phases of feeling like a real piece of shit because of it. My mental health issues specifically. That's the mud.
6810 2018-05-08 16:26:26 We're the highest exporter of oil currently, also they're developing nuclear arms... Sooo
6811 2018-05-08 16:26:23 Portobello mushrooms are great grilled or broiled with olive oil, garlic, oregano, sea salt, sweet basil, pepper, and a bit of parmesan.

6812 2018-05-08 16:26:23 #irandeal Traitor in Chief Donald Trump is pulling out to boost Russian oil! Russia is strapped for cash. This will help them Bigly! Vote Blue today to say ENOUGH!
6813 2018-05-08 16:26:18 The affected sanctions, imposed by Congress in 2012, require other countries to reduce Iranian oil imports or risk U.S. sanctions on their _banks and their ability to conduct Iran-

6815 2018-05-08 16:26:09 Bet trumps got a little riding on an oil spike- mid seventies a barrel and rising.
6816 2018-05-08 16:26:03 What about some fresh lemon juice and olive oil?

6819 2018-05-08 16:25:50 I feel the same way about that video with the squirrel trying to climb up the pole to the bird feeder, but the owner has covered it in oil. It just keeps slipping back down but it never gives up.
6820 2018-05-08 16:25:48 As I said, where were you exporting to and from and what were you exporting? Artwork or artifacts? Paintings? Framed or Unframed? I have bought oil paintings from Lekki Market in Lagos and no export license was required.
6821 2018-05-08 16:25:38 And what do we get out of the deal?  Maybe the gratitude of a loathsome terrorist state. Maybe some of the proceeds of stolen oil of Golan Heights. Maybe more tech that is "battle tested" on civilians.  Not a good deal.
6822 2018-05-08 16:25:24 Trump's decision could be bad for Iran in terms of interntnl trade if the EU decided to join the sanction. 

Winners: Oil producing nations will see a surge in oil prices
Losers: Consumers of oil worldwide. People who use petrol, diesel, engine oil, petrochemical, plastic etc.
6823 2018-05-08 16:25:22 $tsla moving downward as traders think Iran will flood market with oil, thereby lowering the need for electric vehicles.

6828 2018-05-08 16:25:08 With the price of oil increasing, how will this effect some US  auto manufacturers’ sales?  Some manufacturers, such as @Ford, are reported to stop make most cars in favor of bigger vehicles, such as SUVs. #3$gallongastax
6829 2018-05-08 16:24:51 You seem a bit narrow minded. Did you know it's the US that has always been hostile towards Iran, because of their oil?

6844 2018-05-08 16:23:55 @EmmanuelMacron I believe Trump wants to cancel the Iran deal because he wants to bring up fossil fuel costs , which will benefit Putin, he also tried to get the crown prince to stop refining oil.  He is a snake only looking out for himself.
6845 2018-05-08 16:23:51 Well, Trump doesn't care if the sanctions place on Iran, he doesn't have to pay to fill up at the pump. If we were to use the oil we produce the price we'd be  be paying  $2.25 per gallon

6874 2018-05-08 16:21:42 It will force the price the of oil to go up due to the instability of the region. So if you are a country like Russia that survives on selling oil, then watching the pice go up will benefit them greatly.

6899 2018-05-08 16:20:08 @realDonaldTrump you fool no one with withdrawing from the Iran deal. It is all about undoing something Obama did, appeasing Israel, bowing down to big oil and greasing the war machine.  Your policies are bad for the world
6900 2018-05-08 16:19:59 Thanks lovely. They always give me petroleum jelly to put on until the stitches come out. Feels disgusting to touch them  I prefer not to use petroleum-based products, so I might try something more natural this time. Lavender oil would be a lot nicer x
6901 2018-05-08 16:19:59 That and anything to drive the price of oil through the roof again.  High oil prices mean a lot of money for Putin and the oligarchs of Russia.  You can bet this is a dual favor being done, for Russia and Israel.

6907 2018-05-08 16:19:40 As I said the other day, when Obama left office on January 20, 2017, I was paying $2.67 a gallon, in SoCal. It's now pennies away from $4.00 a gallon. Now, with Donnie likely pulling the US out of the #IranDeal, oil prices will soar. Imagine what the gas prices will then be... 
6908 2018-05-08 16:19:35 The fact that environmentalists use some petroleum products has zero credibility.  We need far less plastic. One by one plastic will be reduced, straws, plastic bags, oil will be around for a long time. The ISSUE is burning fossil fuel for heat or energy. That must be phased out.

6937 2018-05-08 16:18:03 Tearing up the #IranDeal is a huge mistake, done out of spite, with no backup plan other than bumbling towards war. Netanyahu, arms manufacturers, oil producers, and Putin will be thrilled.
6938 2018-05-08 16:18:01 No, Trump, you are creating havoc.  End our agreement w/Iran will cause oil to cost more & isolate US.  Iran won’t renegotiate.  Why should they?  Because you want them too?
6939 2018-05-08 16:18:00 Proverbs 27:9 (Passion Translation NT)
Sweet friendships refresh the soul and awaken our hearts with joy, for good friends are like the anointing oil
that yields the fragrant incense of God’s presence.
6940 2018-05-08 16:17:54 Palm oil production is a kind of plague that infects valuable habitats & causes environmental havac. It's import should be banned totally.

6943 2018-05-08 16:17:35 I’ve been using apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil - seems to help! The vinegar is supposed to pull out the toxins.
6944 2018-05-08 16:17:23 Idiot,  the US has been the villain here, committing crimes, such as organizing the coup in 1954 against the democratically elected PM, for the sake of oil.
6945 2018-05-08 16:17:19 without EU / Russia / China support. Will it have much effect on Iran oil sales?
6946 2018-05-08 16:17:18 @Daniyar78734153 you're a bot too. But oil fundamentals are going to hit ultra oil bills hard.
6947 2018-05-08 16:17:17 Ohh also shoutout to that Earthquake today. First one I’ve ever felt that wasn’t necessarily caused by fracking for oil #earthquake #frackoff #stopusingoil #please #ffs

Any how US want crude price up...and dont forget US who also start oil export
6950 2018-05-08 16:16:52 @CNNLIVE_ I Was right. Those who are worry that @realDonaldTrump breaks the IRAN deal they are ONLY worry for their business, oil prices and own interests in IRAN. Only Money drives their Speculations and concerns
6951 2018-05-08 16:16:51 My manager was trying to tell me about oil pulling and when I remained skeptical she told me to google it but the first thing that popped up was that it doesnt work
6952 2018-05-08 16:16:49 ไม่อ่านละโว้ยยยยย
6953 2018-05-08 16:16:43 Ok, he pulls out the deal,  the other folks won't.  Oil prices go up, you'll hear a ton of drill baby drill stuff from the gop. McConnell put energy policies on the floor to divide our party. 

We fight as red state dems go with the gop on drilling and fracking.

Trump skates.

6956 2018-05-08 16:16:34 As soon as Bolton came on, everyone knew we were headed for war with Iran... it’s a game for the Republicans oh and the oil is a bonus...God knows how high gas prices will go though...I’m thinking $4-$5 a gallon...#trumpwantsawar
6957 2018-05-08 16:16:34 I’m about to start making that dirty oil field money. People keep saying I can’t do it but fuck that I can.
6958 2018-05-08 16:16:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
6959 2018-05-08 16:16:29 Y'know when vegetable oil and apple juice are in similar bottles and you use apple juice to stir fry the veg.... that 
6960 2018-05-08 16:16:27 I wish I was at the met gala to give Selena Gomez an oil blotting sheet last night
6961 2018-05-08 16:16:18 just think about this

make monster from iran=buy oil in low price=sell weapon in high price

and just answer why all terrorists and attckers in america or europe have arab nationality not irani???
6962 2018-05-08 16:16:12 He's basically helping Russia as the oil price increases.
6963 2018-05-08 16:15:52 @FoxBusiness Shouldn’t we be getting about a 2 billion dollar oil credit from Iran or they could just return all the cash we have given them because of this “deal “?!
6964 2018-05-08 16:15:47 US stock market is now in red but with minor losses, crude oil is down 2.6% and 10-year bond yield again approaching the 3% level. #stocks #equities #finance #investing

International oil prices contracted by 67% but in India these rates went up by 110%

That is why deflecting attention?

Is it not the duty of responsible media to expose lies being spreaded ?
6967 2018-05-08 16:15:30 The CO2 narrative is entirely about Liberals attacking Alberta’s key industry.  Does anyone really think that excluding New Brunswick coal plants, foreign oil going to Quebec from carbon taxes, looks like they are sincere about reducing CO2?  #trudeaumustgo

6969 2018-05-08 16:15:18 @GOP Good to know another Republican Leader in WH will cause another war in Mid East to sent another over 4500 American Kids to die and if not die be destroyed over there or by gop in congress here.  While trump takes oil and runs. Katie BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WILL BE ON TRUMP SOLEY
6970 2018-05-08 16:15:12 Take their oil would be awesome
6971 2018-05-08 16:15:03 No juice, just oil?
6972 2018-05-08 16:15:02 Trump wants an oil price hike after Iran gets sanctioned. A win-win for Don and Vlad.
6973 2018-05-08 16:14:56 really wish I had more oil.... it is also gonna take a long time to get enough upgrade plans to max out these ships.
6974 2018-05-08 16:14:53 Look at that oil, a bounce,  it is here and now.
6975 2018-05-08 16:14:48 Hopefully I can get these brakes and the oil changed before it gets to 100 degrees
6976 2018-05-08 16:14:46 おやすみん～
6977 2018-05-08 16:14:40 what is the rationale? to keep the price of oil high to justify extractionism in the US and hasten the apocalypse?
6978 2018-05-08 16:14:37 You're correct, Scotland doesnt have an oil wealth fund of £150,000 per person because #Westminster pissed Scotlands wealth up against a wall. 

#indyref2 #scotref
6979 2018-05-08 16:14:30 There was never a motive for Russians to favor Trump. Trump energy independence stance was grave threat to Russia lucrative oil economy. Trump military update plans grave threat to Russian global expansion.
6980 2018-05-08 16:14:26 Ditching of Iran Deal by US will further boost Oil prices..world economy will suffer for sure but Russia n Saudia will make money with higher oil prices..wirkd economics n geopolitics has gone very very complex
6981 2018-05-08 16:14:23 People back home are asking questions about the oil field and acting like it’s horrible.
6982 2018-05-08 16:14:15 What if there was a cheaper option would you break up with Mobile A1 oil?

6984 2018-05-08 16:14:06 Thats what talking about all the time. Oil price has nothing with real oil supply and demand with mbd. Institutions big money and small hedge funds set the price by manipulating futures. Supply and demand in futures. How they interpret news.

6986 2018-05-08 16:14:00 Headlines are funny today:  Oil (bounces/falls) on report Trump to (stay in/wthdraw from) the Iran Deal.  #FakeNews
6987 2018-05-08 16:13:55 @realDonaldTrump 
Trump is likely to cancel Iran deal today. This may be a quid pro quo deal wherein Trump targets Iran to raise oil prices to 80 dollars per barrel and Saudi Arabia lists Aramco on Nasdaq or Dow Jones.

6992 2018-05-08 16:13:28 Keep buying more oil trusts and commodities...I don't think Trump has the ability to reason and make a decision thats good for the country...
6993 2018-05-08 16:13:12 Given the recent increase in oil prices, I wouldn't be surprised if we found out that Donald Trump had a lot of futures and options in oil stocks.

6995 2018-05-08 16:13:00 War with Iran is, and has been, a goal for neocon hawks like Pence, Bolton, and Pompeo for decades. It’s about oil. It’s been the goal since Mossadegh nationalized Iran’s oil in 1951, which brought on Operation Ajax & the Shah, then the Islamic Revolution & US hostage-taking.
6996 2018-05-08 16:12:58 Now confused, In the Big Fat Fix Aseem Malhotra wax’s lyrical about the health Benefits of Extra Virgin olive oil, do you disagree with him ?
6997 2018-05-08 16:12:51 Possible reprucussions of leaving #JCPOA:
-Iranian oil embargo to U.S. allies
-Outright blocking of oil through Persian Gulf
-ME Arms Race where Saudis and Iranian gain nuclear weapons (poss. through North Korea or Pakistan)
-Direct war between Israel and Iran
6998 2018-05-08 16:12:42 Oil and gas  money is still oil and gas money please.
6999 2018-05-08 16:12:41 Quote from my testimony made yesterday "There is simply no scientific rationale that could explain why oil & gas activities could be done safely in a marine protected area, but not in the middle of the Gros Morne National Park" - dual standards in conservation...
7000 2018-05-08 16:12:34 Crazy policy, driven by the #Neocon ,  #Netanyahu's racist, expansionist administration, and oil exporting Arab dictators, who fear their own people and want YOU to pay higher prices at the pumps.

Higher oil prices is also good for #Russia and #Putin too, of course...

7007 2018-05-08 16:12:00 The hope was for better integration into the world economic system and the young people coming more to the fore resulting in a less aggressive Iran. There is still that Sunni-Shiite thing though and the influence over the oil countries and oil pricing. What a World!
7008 2018-05-08 16:11:57 ขอบคุณค่ะ
7009 2018-05-08 16:11:52 Ag customers are different. 

Exxon doesn't lose money if 500 lot of crude oil trades 2c higher than the settlement after markets. 

Whereas the rice farmer with working orders at 13.14 last week wasn't filled even though 35% of that day's volume traded there in secret.
7010 2018-05-08 16:11:49 Will China and India go along with reimposition of oil sanctions? European oil companies might be cowed into compliance.
7011 2018-05-08 16:11:39 Russian oil interests benefit from sanctions on Iranian oil. The Saudis benefit from sanctions on Iranian oil...oh yeah and the American oil industry, specifically hydrofracking oil drilling, will benefit from oil prices going up as result too.  Basically big oil.

7014 2018-05-08 16:11:30 Sounds like oil exporting countries will do well, especially those far from the potential Mideast conflict zone. I’m trying to remember the name of the world’s 2nd largest oil exporting country. I know it starts with “R” and ends with “a” but I can’t put my finger on it.
7015 2018-05-08 16:11:29 your mcm pays someone to change their oil
7016 2018-05-08 16:11:25 But what Iran will go back to doing which I can guarantee is will they will threaten to shut down the Straight of Hormuz where most of the oil is transported through! Anytime they even threaten to close it, Gas Prices go through the roof!
7017 2018-05-08 16:11:16 So here's what's next with withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. We will immediately see higher gas prices. Is this the REAL intent from Trump, to boost Oil profits? I put nothing past this Mafioso @realDonaldTrump. He will do anything to line his and his supporter's pockets
7018 2018-05-08 16:11:14 After a full session on confectionery fats, it's very interesting to now learn on fat/oil from #insects. Will this be the future? #AOCS2018 @aocs
7019 2018-05-08 16:11:13 Crazy week this week at Hunter Oil. We have three new locations come on board and are firing on all cylinders. It’s great to be busy!
7020 2018-05-08 16:10:47 @realDonaldTrump will withdraw from the deal for two reasons. It will drive up the price of oil which will enable his buddies to make billions and he will remove another Obama accomplishment. He hates Obama.

7023 2018-05-08 16:10:34 Why do a do stupid things like sit in the sun for 6 hours with baby oil on
7024 2018-05-08 16:10:28 If Europe says that they are going ahead with the deal then Iran will not really care if the US backs out as they have the rest of the world to trade with and the US will lose a lot of investment and many US oil companies will lose also. Dumb!
7025 2018-05-08 16:10:25 Now question is, is the US planning to instigate some eish again with Iran as they did with Olympic games...And maybe kick off a nuke or two for the oil
7026 2018-05-08 16:10:24 It is! Pensioners money has already been taxed all the way to hell - while earned, spent, & as relatives died etc etc. Furthermore, the baby boom was a working & paying tax boom for decades. If governments have 'lost' that (& all those oil grillions) it doesn't = us paying again.

7038 2018-05-08 16:09:54 I believe this will raise the cost of a barrel of oil...that will benefit those who have been suffering from depressed oil prices...Russia being one.
7039 2018-05-08 16:09:53 Well...that was interesting. Oil was up, down, all over the place. We're still down, as it appears - per the NYT - that Trump is indeed withdrawing from the #Irandeal and will also impose new sanctions, too. 

From an oil mkts perspective, full magnitude hard to see yet. #OOTT
7040 2018-05-08 16:09:49 #irandeal Wake up People! Trump is pulling out of Iran deal to boost Russian oil plain and simple. Open your eyes! Trump has continued to do everything in his power to hurt the United states while helping Russia! Vote blue today to say ENOUGH! is ENOUGH!
7041 2018-05-08 16:09:44 I humbly disagree. You defended oil interests and others benefitting and profiting from war. But I suppose there was a fringe benefit from you showing other militarys our power. Not trying to insult you, just defending myself and my point of ciew.

7043 2018-05-08 16:09:28 That's a bit silly actually. Why don't you campaign to leave the USS pension fund since it invests in weapons, tobacco and oil? Do you? Gesture politics is stupid.
7044 2018-05-08 16:09:27 That’s not the way it works. Jesus.   There have been a number of women who said they didn’t like him groping.  But no...a man cannot just grab a woman by the pussy without consent before.  It’s sexual assault.  And yes...he also said we should have stolen oil from Iraq.

7046 2018-05-08 16:09:19 Okay, okay you have more and bigger guns than me. Happy now? Go oil them up and whisper sweet nothings in their barrels. Geez. Guns are tools not fetishes. I have hammers and screwdrivers too. Want to know what kind?
7047 2018-05-08 16:09:16 The Old saying comes to mind, "The Squeaky Wheel gets the Oil!"The Opposing group should get together and have a Debate in the school about whatever this one person is complaining about. MAGA "In God We Trust"
7048 2018-05-08 16:09:15 Baking soda, coconut oil, and other thicker vegetable oils are natural antipersperants, but yea crystal deoderants are definitely a good middle ground for much stronger anti perspirant action!
7049 2018-05-08 16:09:13 I believe what you say. 
But there is  going  to be monumental global changes. Saudi Arabia and Russia former relies on oil which is not now wanted, and latter Russia's riots against Putin could lead to destabilise trade.But not like the Tories lead on this.

7061 2018-05-08 16:08:09 This is the stupidest, most short-sighted decision in the history of the world, since the immediate negative consequences can be seen clearly even by a blind person. I guess you want to start a war and try to get their oil. Victor, spoils, and all that (whch you said about Iraq).

7072 2018-05-08 16:07:33 He's going to withdraw from the the deal in order to drive up the price of oil.  Not only does he not give a shit about the deal, he has no idea of what it does. Money for big oil, that's the bottom line.
7073 2018-05-08 16:07:29 Just got new tires and now gotta get oil change man cars expensive Ima just start walking
7074 2018-05-08 16:07:18 Crude: A day of reckoningCrude oil prices face a day of reckoning as the United States decides whether it will remain in the Iranian nuclear accord, as well as the realization is that due to underinvestment in oil, it might be difficult to replace Iranian oil if it is taken of...
7075 2018-05-08 16:07:17 Iran sits on the world's 2nd largest natural gas & 4th largest crude oil reserves. Why should Iran ever "get poorer!? Becuz the Islamists in Iran have stolen the country's wealth, and EVERYONE knows this!

7077 2018-05-08 16:07:01 On @YahooFinance right now we’re telling you oil markets may be guessing wrong on Trumps’s Iran decision
7078 2018-05-08 16:06:57 ATTENTION PRESIDENT TRUMP....OIL PRICES HIT...$70.00 Per Barrel.
Refinery's At Full Cap. Oil Tankers Floating Up And Down East Coast..No Where To Put Oil..Should Be $40.00 Per. Barrel...HELP..!!!
7079 2018-05-08 16:06:54 you don’t need oil for that. air would do
7080 2018-05-08 16:06:51 Those oil barrels are blocking your path!
7081 2018-05-08 16:06:46 I respectfully disagree about this being a distraction. War with Iran is, and has been, a goal for neocon hawks like Pence, Bolton, and Pompeo for decades. It’s about oil. It’s been the goal since Mossadegh nationalized Iran’s oil in 1951.
7082 2018-05-08 16:06:43 So, with this withdrawal from JCPOA, EU firms will be forced to pull out of Iran (or scuttle plans to enter) to avoid US banking sanctions. Russia/China/India may still buy oil, but what stops Iran from resuming nuclear program, other than war? Is that really better?
7083 2018-05-08 16:06:38 Oil or Gas the USA does not give a damn Doug they think all these assets belong to the USA no matter what country there in

7086 2018-05-08 16:06:28 Several times in my career I've encountered oil shocks. Airlines simply cut routes / axe flights / reduce services ... despite all the hype the PR people have said earlier (before the oil price hikes).

7089 2018-05-08 16:06:17 the price of oil will go up in the long run if US can enforce real oil sanctions on Iran

7094 2018-05-08 16:06:06 The positive correlation between oil prices and Nifty brings out a conflict between an #investor and an #Economist. Given the rising oil prices, investor enjoy the rise, while an economist is worried about #macrostability. #Economics #Statistics

7096 2018-05-08 16:06:03 Thinking that we all lose spending power. Nothing much from the tax cut, gas prices up and all goods related to oil. What a deal for us!!!
7097 2018-05-08 16:05:59 They’re clearly just spoofing oil prices. #jeenyus

7099 2018-05-08 16:05:48 Oil prices and gas prices are always higher under Republican administrations. Weird. Must be a coincidence.
7100 2018-05-08 16:05:46 How else is russia going to make money from oil sales! They’re going to rake it in, #theorangeking is handing it to them. This with removed sanctions means putin can get the boat out of drydock in europe!
7101 2018-05-08 16:05:43 He is planning to let gas prices go up and hand over more National Parks Land to corporations digging for oil. Taking more land from Native Americans as if they have not being robbed enough already

7104 2018-05-08 16:05:33 I'm not sure about the rest of you, but I'm okay with Crude Oil fluctuating $5/barrel if that means sanctions and real nuclear deterrents in Iran.

They are State Sponsors of Terrorism. 

We do not base our strategy around extortion and blackmail from Ayatollahs.
7105 2018-05-08 16:05:33 Comparing yourself to 2 years of negative growth and just getting positive is not booming. Haven't even equaled the 2014 gdp yet with oil at +$70

7122 2018-05-08 16:04:47 Based on Don's previous insults, tariffs and lies that have resulted in other world crisis and stock tumbles, it looks like don is heavily invested in oil from OPEC nations. Piss off Iran, Saudi's will crank up the price again, we pay more, investors giggle with glee.
7123 2018-05-08 16:04:45 Mas o oil não está subindo ...

Pelo contrário, cai quase 2%
7124 2018-05-08 16:04:41 You're absolutely correct, and then they'll throw for more oil in the US and destroy our environment . We will also have more earthquakes due to fracking.
7125 2018-05-08 16:04:37 You are being too kind. He is a blood sucking parasite. A vampire. His contribution has been absolutely zero. He has lived comfortably from selling snake oil. Credibility zero.

7130 2018-05-08 16:04:18 You heard it here first. 

If Trump pulls out of the #IranDeal, expect a huge increase in the price of oil nearly instantly and the price of gas shortly thereafter. 

Trumpettes, that OK with you?

7133 2018-05-08 16:03:59 Gas prices are in part set by speculators who try to foresee future oil prices.  That is why there can be a lag between oil barrel price drops and gas prices in the US.

7135 2018-05-08 16:03:54 Agree, I just mean the larger swings in my view are primarily dollar driven. Even now the rising oil piece is less the story in my view.
7136 2018-05-08 16:03:51 Just another day at the Office. Great session with Cognite, MindXtract, Sund Energy and FourICT, about datacollection, sharing information and improving the Oil & Gas Business.
7137 2018-05-08 16:03:43 I'm thinking, "an interesting view into human behavior". It was "amazing" a couple years ago when we were tipping each other $DOGE for fun. Last year when the amount of money to be made skyrocketed, a lot of unknown "experts" and noob "OG's" started selling snake oil en masse.
7138 2018-05-08 16:03:41 Iran has long been the end game for Israel/US/Britain/Saudi's + allies.

Iran became 'evil' once it nationalised its oil in 79.

Everything flows from that.
7139 2018-05-08 16:03:36 Natapos ko rin ang Oil Record Book.   makakatulog na
7140 2018-05-08 16:03:31 Is that primarily because of expected Eurozone and MidEast/Oil chaos? 

As I see that, but I also try to balance it in my head against the Sino-Russian economic alignment and the pressure that #petroyuan will bring against the western world’s #petrodollar reserve.
7141 2018-05-08 16:03:28 Hint: Measure the flour, THEN sift
I was in high school before I ever made anything that called for sifted flour. I had one of those oil-can-lookin' sifters with the crank, and I tried sifting into a measuring cup and my culinary teacher smacked me with a dish towel.

7171 2018-05-08 16:01:33 Russians benefit from an increase in oil price per barrell; it is unprofitable for Russia to produce their oil when the price falls to around $40/barrell. Trump's delivering a benefit to Putin, and possibly himself, as he may have been given a %  of Rosneft via Carter Paige

cause instability in the Middle East
exacerbate sectarian tensions
undermine diplomacy with North Korea
alienate our allies
show the U.S. to be untrustworthy 
lead to higher oil prices

In the long run, even Israel loses.
7200 2018-05-08 15:59:37 Only thing i hate about getting color in my hair is this joint be feeling so dry and i be putting endless oil in it 
7201 2018-05-08 15:59:21 This is beyond the March of Folly.  This is the Reign of Stupidity. War is coming, just like Net-yahoo wants. And astronomical oil prices. And Trump thinks a conflagration in the Gulf will throw off Mueller and the Democratic resurgence in the midterms.  He's is one evil man.
7202 2018-05-08 15:59:07 Indeed they are.  And not necessarily just the first-order ones we are discussing re: the deal.  While Russia, for example, might benefit from rising oil prices...China and NK will both be deeply hurt by them.
7203 2018-05-08 15:58:59 More electricity used per mile refining oil for fossil cars than EVs use per mile. As EVs replace fossils, less electricity will be required as refining of oil decreases. EVs will get cleaner as electricity gets cleaner, unlike fossil car toxic exhaust emissions & oil production.
7204 2018-05-08 15:58:55 This has little to do with the deal. The real deal is to starve allies of Iran and cripple economic progress derived from energy.

7205 2018-05-08 15:58:47 Cnn fakenews outburst caused oil to go down today . Anything that I see with cnn I automatically know it’s #fakenews
7206 2018-05-08 15:58:45 House warming gift?? I replace the oil with unsweetened apple sauce so they're halfway healthy 
7207 2018-05-08 15:58:41 Nah but this is unedited. After landing from a 6 hour flight. After a week of only getting 4 hours of sleep cause i was working a conference. No foundation on. Jus a little concealer and powder. Praise Jah for good genes and rosehip oil. My God is good.
7208 2018-05-08 15:58:37 I need an oil change so bad I’m about to dig a hole an just see what happens
7209 2018-05-08 15:58:37 I think Sudan has to withdraw forces from Yemen. Obviously this allegiance with Saudi Arabia is not worth its trouble! 

We be dying for them and they wouldn’t even give us their oil leftouts!
7210 2018-05-08 15:58:33 Absolutely CHEERING listening to @NunatsiavutGov Director of Environment call out #nlpoli for prioritizing oil over the fish industry w/ new targets & the deaf consultation process. We need this kind of critical thinking in our own govt! @TheBroadcastCBC

7212 2018-05-08 15:58:28 @jiffylube Jiffy Lube is great and I've always had excellent service, but I can't bear that ten minutes of "up-selling" you have to endure every visit. All I want is an oil change!!
7213 2018-05-08 15:58:10 My entire drive down the highway involved a ratty, slow, obnoxious EF hatch trying to race me.
I think he burned all his oil along the way.

THEME; SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT,SAVE LIFE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF NIGER DELTA
Due to the lingering environment issues (Oil Spillage, Gas flaring etc.) in the Niger Delta Region due to Oil and Gas exploration
7215 2018-05-08 15:57:57 my neighborhood wash & fold left oil stains all over my everlane pants grrrrr
7216 2018-05-08 15:57:49 It's always been about the oil.
7217 2018-05-08 15:57:47 They are secretly accumulating crypto as they speak....  Oil companies don’t like electric cars either.  If they hate it, I love it.
7218 2018-05-08 15:57:44 Who wins?  Gas companies and Russia who gets to see 100$ per barrel oil!  #GOPTaxScam
7219 2018-05-08 15:57:43 Personality, is like a water and an oil, its not compatible.
7220 2018-05-08 15:57:40 koi kisi ko v laye but why crude oil being refined by private company n sold to goverment?r we ppl idiot tht we will pay more for all petroleum products?
7221 2018-05-08 15:57:35 Let's face it: The Obamas could have planted a garden that spelled out, "we love Trump," when it blossomed, and Donald would still trample it and change his golf cart's oil there, because "they" planted it. @Mespared
7222 2018-05-08 15:57:23 Anyone that knows Sukhi knows how much she loves Italy & Kohli!! She is cricket / football mad  and yes Hun 3 days! Ontop of that I had 2 days worth of oil in my hair that I wasn’t allowed to wash till my wedding day!! Maybe round 2 can be a Bollywood destination wedding! 
7223 2018-05-08 15:57:23 I can imagine reason (4) being given by early oil traders who "trade in barrels, think in barrels and designed carts for barrels"...where are we today? still thinking and trading in barrels, but there aren't any damn barrels.
7224 2018-05-08 15:57:20 And then look at Norway , which is now the brexiteers plus model , which was so bad an idea for indy in 2014.

Next year 40 years of oil theft , Norway's wealth fund only started in 90s , and is worth over 1 Trillion dollars.

Are we "Too Wee" or just too institutionalized?
7225 2018-05-08 15:57:17 .@realDonaldTrump OIL PRICES WILL GO UP IF YOU BACK OUT OF IRAN DEAL! DON'T DO IT!!
7226 2018-05-08 15:57:13 dream on..... the future is a snake oil salesman like Musk cash burning taxpayer and investor money on FALSE PROMISES (& shitty cars soon to be put out of biz by automakers that actually make profits). 

but it gets better...... LOL
7227 2018-05-08 15:57:00 Time to buy oil futures because 4 dollar gas is coming
7228 2018-05-08 15:57:00 I am guessing his oil buddies sold their stocks yesterday???
7229 2018-05-08 15:57:00 I’ll bring the baby oil
7230 2018-05-08 15:56:57 Trump is pulling out of Iran because he wants to increase the price of fossil fuels which will help Putin, that's why he talked to the Middle Eastern prince to try to get him off Oil.  Trump is all for increasing our gas prices.
7231 2018-05-08 15:56:34 You fucking #OOTTmoron s are desperate to pump this back. Nothing about Trump or Iran will affect oil supply and demand. We are getting oil builds. What the fuck are you buying? #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Forex
7232 2018-05-08 15:56:27 I only cook with olive oil
7233 2018-05-08 15:56:27 เหนื่อย
7234 2018-05-08 15:56:03 Rumor is they are still sitting on some of the Shah's bullion reserves, and there is always illegal oil trading. Just saying some American companies will be anti sanctions.
7235 2018-05-08 15:55:55 Texas oil companies are foreign funded special interest groups too and they dont care about what is best for Albertans either.  Albertans care about the economy and the environment. It is not one or the other.  It is both. Change your message to talk about both.
7236 2018-05-08 15:55:38 I’m at Walmart & tell the lady I wanna get my oil changed & she said the wait is over 3 hrs.. HOW MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR OIL CHANGED AT NOON ON A TUESDAY
7237 2018-05-08 15:55:35 Probably to make Gartman to short oil. Nice tag team going
7238 2018-05-08 15:55:25 Price of oil is plunging over the Iran crap..so when will gas prices fall?  They rise instantaneously.

7243 2018-05-08 15:55:05 うおおおおおっっっlんn
7244 2018-05-08 15:54:53 Trump wants control of the oil. The higher gas prices go the more those invested in oil, like Trump and Pruitt, make.
7245 2018-05-08 15:54:50 Thx.. - look at the 3 year chart - can't call this a 'crowded short'.  But if #Trump pulls out, Iran will issue threats and that should keep oil bubbling
7246 2018-05-08 15:54:50 We finally got essential oil diffuser and last night was first night in a week I didn’t turn it on.. today I can’t breath & I’m sneezing all over the place!
7247 2018-05-08 15:54:26 Anyone know how Sean Hannity's trading account is positioned on #oil?  #iran
7248 2018-05-08 15:54:19 One would expect oil price to go up with the possibility of deterioration in the region as a result of withdrawal
7249 2018-05-08 15:54:11 We will find out 6 months later CNN executives shorted 1000's of oil contracts before the story, then went long 1000's of contracts minutes later and made millions in 20 minutes
7250 2018-05-08 15:54:11 間違いなく胃が小さくなってる
7251 2018-05-08 15:54:07 .@TuckerCarlson I agree that there's a problem with men not being men these days. Can you come over and help me change my oil, without looking up how to do it on YouTube first?
7252 2018-05-08 15:54:01 I'm waiting to get my oil changed and if the other woman in this waiting room keeps humming every song that comes on for the next hour I'll be in jail by 3.
7253 2018-05-08 15:53:49 Method:
Sweat onions, Beetroot and Garlic in large Pot with 50ml Olive Oil. Add your herbs. Then add your stock. Cook till beetroot is soft. Blend. Season and serve.
7254 2018-05-08 15:53:43 You don't oil balls!
7255 2018-05-08 15:53:43 The #oil bounce is coming #bulls just wait for that 1pm candle on $WTI $GNPX at it again?
7256 2018-05-08 15:53:35 High oil prices?
7257 2018-05-08 15:53:30 The money needs to be followed on this.   What members of congress, the Trump org. And Russians had a heads up this was coming and made or will make a fortune with rising oil prices.  The SEC should be looking into suspicious trading activity across the board here.
7258 2018-05-08 15:53:28 Hemp CBD oil is NOT for me, would prefer actual cannabis - but thanks
7259 2018-05-08 15:53:28 Ahead of the President's Iran announcement polls find 2/3 of the public believe we should stay in the deal. Oil prices are also tumbling ahead of announcement. President has made no secret he things deals like this are bad for the US.
7260 2018-05-08 15:53:20 This afternoon I got a new eye prosthesis, a tasty carrot cake and a nice beard oil.
7261 2018-05-08 15:53:14 Yeah, but gas prices won't go down. The oil companies will come up with some "Fake" reason to raise them even more.
7262 2018-05-08 15:53:11 If oil runs, everything runs

7266 2018-05-08 15:52:36 Good job brother. 

Am proud to here this from you and indeed you became good person.
As I refer the way you were very concerned to train us to be good moderator in 2015 in CgD and REPOA project concerning oil and gas in Tanzania.

7268 2018-05-08 15:52:30 Let's see re oil prices and UST yields . Given speculative positioning, "buy the rumour sell the fact" seems ripe.
7269 2018-05-08 15:52:28 the US is the biggest oil exporter on earth, so if it makes oil prices go up that's actually a net positive for us
7270 2018-05-08 15:52:28 same here hahaha...most products don't work on my hair. i just put a small amount of coconut oil after a shower and let it air dry or wear a cap to at least tame it. works every time 
7271 2018-05-08 15:52:27 You live in a Legal District.  Any health food store will have CBD oil.  CBD WILL ease your pain with no psychoactive effects.  Ten drops in your morning coffee, tea in the afternoon & evening and you will feel the difference.
7272 2018-05-08 15:52:27 It's like the Iraq War all over again. 

Why?  Why go to war?

Oh yeah!  Profits!...starting with oil companies.
7273 2018-05-08 15:52:24 This will likely subside soon. While a pain right now we could see oil prices ease in the coming months which would likely bring gas prices a little lower.
7274 2018-05-08 15:52:18 Aside from oil, $XLE, maybe intermediate inflation does Iran deal affect $QQQ and $SPY performance? Not really I would guess.
7275 2018-05-08 15:52:16 I could be wrong, but I don't think the oil people necessarily benefit here.
7276 2018-05-08 15:52:13 oil  higher and bid and usd ars   lot lower  looking to sell this usd mex rally

7283 2018-05-08 15:51:50 As of now it's being reported that Trump will back out of the Iranian Deal but will reinstate sanctions. Crude Oil dropped below $70 a barrel but inching back. Stay tuned for the actual sanction details. Press conference at 2 PM.

7285 2018-05-08 15:51:35 Playoffs. Oil were done by Xmas.
7286 2018-05-08 15:51:34 I’m not sure of this but It appears like those on pro Canadian oil industry side don’t have issue being identified but anti Canadian Oil side - not transparent - Hiding within layers of charitable orgs originating in US.
7287 2018-05-08 15:51:33 Be careful what you wish for.  This will cause gas prices to soar and they are already high in Canada.  This initself makes big $$$ for Russia and even trump as he has share in oil from Russia.  You guy will not be involved in world political issues and will drop in world stands.
7288 2018-05-08 15:51:31 the power to drop the price of crude oil every time he farts is what @realDonaldTrump has been longing for all these years
7289 2018-05-08 15:51:23 Gas up your car today.  Wall Street believes NYT article that Trump will Hard Exit the Iran deal; oil prices are going up as I type.

Already gas went up 8% in April in my neighborhood.

White Pepper (to taste, I personally like it peppery)
Olive Oil

7294 2018-05-08 15:51:08 Why is the price of oil plunging?
7295 2018-05-08 15:51:07 The reason Obama made the Iran deal is because his coalition on sanctions was falling apart. Both the Europeans and the Chinese wanted access to Iranian oil. This has been forgotten by Trump and his supporters.
7296 2018-05-08 15:51:01 เดย์จ้าาา
7297 2018-05-08 15:50:59 Saving on the Gatorade. Must have went long oil and got fucked by CNN. Again. Hahaha

7301 2018-05-08 15:50:33 Oil prices WILL spike. If policy is capable of damaging and penalizing people and sound judgment, domestically and particularly globally, Donald Trump is on board.
7302 2018-05-08 15:50:31 Crude oil tank 2%, wild swings on Iran nuclear deal.

Brent 74.8
7303 2018-05-08 15:50:23 #Bibi is happy. @realDonaldTrump  is happy. #MBS  is happy. Oil is over $70, on the way to $88.
7304 2018-05-08 15:50:21 Not sure who the FOOL in oil market is. Iran oil was NEVER stopped, as India and South Korea did not join sanctions. And now Russia EU and China shall not join. So this is Saudi hype to drive up oil prices.
7305 2018-05-08 15:50:21 Castor oil still undefeated in its battle with my dress shirt collars
7306 2018-05-08 15:50:20 Trump told Macron that the US will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal according to the New York Times, new sanctions on top of old ones will target oil and mineral exports.
7307 2018-05-08 15:50:17 Your article appears to be against the IPO. 
The IPO of Aramco is definitely a shrewd decision and will make Saudi Arabia much richer in the future. 
Waiting until oil is depleted or even substituted is a grave mistake.

7315 2018-05-08 15:49:44 Sure Brexit isnt about Scottish Independence?

It is commonplace that the discovery of oil and entry to the EEC are factors of major economic significance for Scotland. Already both issues, especially the former, feature widely in the SNP’s election material.

7316 2018-05-08 15:49:33 Big swing in Crude OIL prices ahead of "IRAN Nuclear deal" issue.....

Oil pares losses after NYT report that Trump told Macron US will leave Iran nuclear deal.
7317 2018-05-08 15:49:33 ...then why are oil prices dropping?
7318 2018-05-08 15:49:33 This MPA panel is just latest perfect example. Cover the Premier's pro oil message and run off the minute a scientist starts to speak. Media have been unwittingly or otherwise doing yeoman's work for offshore oil sector/govt for years. Boosting the signal on their talking points
7319 2018-05-08 15:49:32 low THC oil....only

7325 2018-05-08 15:49:04 Just wait until he pulls out of the Iran deal. Prices will soar and his oil friends will make money.
7326 2018-05-08 15:49:04 Do not generalize smh. I’m a blink but also a fan of idle. When bp makes a cb i’ll still support idle. It’s just this kind of tweets usually starts the loathe between fandoms. Please stop it. You’re just putting an oil to the gas. AND ALSO, this is the start of idle, dnt ruin it
7327 2018-05-08 15:48:58 Oil and defense stocks should rally. We should be seeing that start soon. Defense already up.  Gas prices going higher. Oh ya. Great for Enron as Americans pay higher and higher energy prices. $ene $noc $eog

7330 2018-05-08 15:48:44 Cui bono? If oil prices spike due to the Iran situation, can you think of a country - and recently re-elected President, who benefit? It’s almost like our President does his bidding...
7331 2018-05-08 15:48:41 Trump said he was in favor of lower oil prices because they usually mean lower prices at the pumps.  But that aint gonna happen if only American oil producers set the local prices.  Nationalism has its costs.

7333 2018-05-08 15:48:34 In this neck of the US, higher oil prices mean drilling activity goes up in the Gulf of Mexico.  So.  Halliburton paid for the Israeli black ops ?  Exxon-Mobil ?

7336 2018-05-08 15:48:11 Wonder if China is going to buy all the Iranian oil?  That probably won't go over real well with Trump and the trade war.
7337 2018-05-08 15:48:08 Told you, trump is long oil

7340 2018-05-08 15:47:38 Yip - North Sea oil costs about $60+ a barrel to extract. The Middle East can be as low as €7.  The oil price will increase anyway - the orange idiot just speeds it up...
7341 2018-05-08 15:47:34 You fucking #OOTTmoron s pushing "OMG Iran Deal!" or "OMG geopolitical risk!" are looking extra stupid right now. No amount of "professionalism" can save you from you being wrong. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #DXY
7342 2018-05-08 15:47:33 It cost the Canadian tax payers 11 million $ the last time the oil companies were investigated for price fixing.. Non was found .. WTF.

7350 2018-05-08 15:46:53 Nobody knows if Trump has or will pull out of Iran deal. Official announcement later today. Oil down about 3%
7351 2018-05-08 15:46:46 This administration can afford oil prices to skyrocket first trade War tariff Tax and now ripping up the Iran deal . Nuclear winter... I'm sure.. thanks.
7352 2018-05-08 15:46:45 I can not support any candidate who just switched sides to become Dem/ Blue. They do not understand our issues. And taking Oil and Gas $$$ Oh my.. Check your candidates well. Your vote is important. Lets pay attention Folks
7353 2018-05-08 15:46:44 Market is a fool. Iran oil was NEVER stopped. India and South Korea continued to buy Iran oil. And now Russia EU and China shall not join. So this is Saudi hype to drive up oil prices.
7354 2018-05-08 15:46:42 @nytimes reports that @realDonaldTrump is getting out of #IranNukeDeal. Stocks not reacting; oil down big...shows that markets guessed right. I bet @jedbabbin is happy. @JohnKerry and @BarackObama not as much. @KOANewsRadio @630khow

7356 2018-05-08 15:46:35 We've seen it all before. I can recall the first oil shock in the 1970s (worked in the travel biz in those days) when airlines axed / merged routes overnight and imposed the first fuel surcharges.  @TheSanjivKapoor
7357 2018-05-08 15:46:33 Yeah man, the first two weeks were tough because my carbs were super high. Once you get passed that stage though it’s amazing the transformation you go through. Energy, better sleep, and of course the weight loss . Did you pick up some MCT oil and Keto strips?
7358 2018-05-08 15:46:26 Today’s move by WH on Iran will restore some sanctions on Iran quickly, Oil will have a few months to wind down. Room will remain for EU to fix flaws in initial JCPOA. Pressure on Iran’s weak economy is first part of wider regional strategy to roll back Iran w/ US EU India Japan

Available in two strengths of CBD Oil and Capsules, their RAW products use an untouched extract from the plant, so it contains a much higher amount of CBDa than other CBD Oils. #rawcbd
7360 2018-05-08 15:46:15 @realDonaldTrump Reimposing sanctions on Iran is what Russia wants since it will raise oil prices, bringing Russia a lot of money.  It will look like you are working for Russia.  Be careful.
7361 2018-05-08 15:46:14 why is the republican lead congress blocking every attempt at getting to the bottom of this scandal. That’s the biggest crime in all of this. Congress is doing everything to keep trump in office because he signs their bills that cut taxes to KOCH BROS. and Big oil and the NRA
7362 2018-05-08 15:46:13 @IbeKachikwu is once again blazing the trail. For years, figures of our crude oil production have been more or less hearsay. With this, we can be sure of accuracy of the data from the oil sector. @nigerianstat @sgyemikale, this must be pertinent for your work.

7367 2018-05-08 15:45:55 I respect all the local media outlets and the journalists but the preference for the oil jobs & prosperity narrative across all outlets when it comes to all things ocean and offshore related is persistent and unmistakable. Environmental concerns always take a backseat.

Hey everyone!  Not only is low energy senile old Donald going to escalate nuclear war with Iran today, our gas prices are going to soar more than they already have under his Inept watch. Hooray! 

Trump is big oil‘s bitch! Get ready to pay more at the pump 
7380 2018-05-08 15:45:20 It’s a relief to finally get an oil change.
7381 2018-05-08 15:45:19 So the Kochs who chiefly benefited from the tax breaks will chiefly benefit from higher oil prices. Is this the United States of Koch?

7386 2018-05-08 15:44:58 We are def fighting a war. For Israel and not for us! We have sent our sons and daughters to die for Israeli land oil and regime change. Iraq is in worse shape.

7391 2018-05-08 15:44:41 And in 2001, a South African petroleum company Engen – which later
became a major oil retailer in Kenya – almost pulled out of the country after
being bombarded with requests for harambee contributions from senior
members of the government in the form of bribes
7392 2018-05-08 15:44:39 American shale rigs are still only at 1/2 the count that were in place last time we were at $70 oil- plenty of supply - and more to come into play if it gets too far above $50
7393 2018-05-08 15:44:37 Thanks for ur reply. There's not much to understand I guess. I asked a simple question, isn't Palm Oil considered inferior? Especially when this product is loved by kids. If u want, DM me, I'll provide my number.
7394 2018-05-08 15:44:35 I stay beside Aberdeen - so it'd boost the economy here too.  As you'll know, the area was hit hard by the big fall in oil prices - as was Houston and other oil towns...
7395 2018-05-08 15:44:30 We spend much of our lives looking in mirrors, taking selfies etc that we don't seem to really know what we look like to others. So I downloaded an app that shows your "true self" and really wish I didn't! Always known I'm no oil painting but I didn't realise I'm THAT ugly!
7396 2018-05-08 15:44:29 It's a oil industry shake down.. he's trying 2 get more $$ out of them 2 fail the deal. Lots of $ getting made on wall street..

7400 2018-05-08 15:44:18 Dhampur's ethanol producing capacity is 3 lakh KLPD.. I'm guessing that's the highest among sugar mills in India. With oil prices inching higher, makes sense to buy Dhampur.

7431 2018-05-08 15:42:01 Please. I am fully aware of the details of this pipeline, the impacts and risks of what’s in the pipe, and where it comes from, and where it’s going.

I live on the route, where more than 30km of new (not twinned) line will be built.

Climate leaders don’t build oil pipelines.
7432 2018-05-08 15:41:57 Can someone tell me why an oil change just cost me $45 ... I would have just googled how to do it, and taken the risk for this price.
7433 2018-05-08 15:41:53 At minimum, Trump's 2PM speech will include plenty of badgering and aggressive rhetoric towards Iran. Would not want to be short crude oil ahead of this speech regardless.
7434 2018-05-08 15:41:53 Ok oil that makes sense, however still think there needs to be a stand off.  Wind farms have a kilometer standoff for the full diameter for safety with land use for the power transmition conduit and grid.  We have that along with solar

7460 2018-05-08 15:40:38 The question that's plaguing the oil market at the moment is the timeline. Are the sanctions going to be right away or is Trump going to leave a grace period for negotiations, as the CNN report suggests?

7468 2018-05-08 15:40:12 And even then, the only reason the West gives any shits about Iran is because of oil interests and Israel. That's really it imo.
7469 2018-05-08 15:40:11 Makes sense. I would like to see oil prices come down for the simple reason that low gas prices are always good on the consumer. Hope to see it in the near future but they say prices will spike if Trump pulls out of the Iran deal. Who knows though, they love to speculate.
7470 2018-05-08 15:40:08 oh man.... just when the entire market went short oil...

7483 2018-05-08 15:38:56 Canada has Shallow Water and vast Horizon. Leave Shell Oil to their Deepwater Horizon. Gulf of Mexico is forever Indebted.

7485 2018-05-08 15:38:49 Same as BC where aquaculture industry killing coastal indigenous species and health of waters. No bad science there. Norway banned such activities but Cda going full on oil and industry anything other that concern over ocean health/resilience.

7487 2018-05-08 15:38:44 Interesting oil futures action on news Trump is not exiting Iran deal after all
$CL_F
7488 2018-05-08 15:38:43 tbh ours was already pretty thick but i’m gonna thicken it up with a bit more flour and also coconut oil which is solid at room temp then chill/nearly freeze it and roll it into balls
7489 2018-05-08 15:38:42 $CL_F I know WTI prices just plummeted after CNN report that Trump will stay in the Iran deal, do you really want to be short crude oil ahead of the 2PM Trump speech? At minimum we can expect plenty of badgering, aggressive rhetoric against Iran during the speech. $UCO $UWT $XLE

7491 2018-05-08 15:38:33 Iran is at risk Why? The world has other resourced for energy . We use less oil . What will they do for Food and Medicine ?If they do not want to work together on this issue . There at risk with the  not use .The U.S.A. Keep our promise with them in the past it there turn now.
7492 2018-05-08 15:38:28 I think he's a true believer in protecting Big Oil from environmental regulation and has no concept of public service, so no understanding of just how corrupt all this is. If it keeps him from accomplishing his agenda at EPA, I'm grateful.

“Behold, I am sending to you

7494 2018-05-08 15:38:16 An oil rich country. Talk about corruption
7495 2018-05-08 15:38:06 So sketchy but oil prices are so low there 
7496 2018-05-08 15:37:50 If my Acura dealer calls me after my service and tells me that if I rate them 10’s on the upcoming Corp survey, he will give me a free oil change - is that kosher? I think not ... @Acura ...

7506 2018-05-08 15:36:58 If Trump pulls out of the #IranDeal, the price of oil will go up instantly. 

Hey, MAGA, folks! Please tell your President to not pull out of the Iran deal? 

Oh, Nevermind! You guys don't get what impact it would have on the nation.
7507 2018-05-08 15:36:57 I gotta go do an oil change 
7508 2018-05-08 15:36:52 @SquawkAlley @carlquintanilla @MorganLBrennan @jonfortt @JackieDeAngelis Initial #wti selloff from #Trump's #IranDeal decision will be shortlive if you consider the geopolitical situation post decision, #wti #oil will drift up & the longer the tension lasts the higher the price
7509 2018-05-08 15:36:48 Well it is one of those things the free market handles itself.

It is all about supply and demand.  What knocked the oil prices down is the supply from the frackers and such.

If the govt tries to regulate it to handle it, it'd just go up, just like everything regulations touch.
7510 2018-05-08 15:36:44 #TRUMP Trump does not care about the hard-working Americans who will be hurt by higher oil and gas prices, he's just a Salesman and he sold us a bill of goods that he cares name one thing he has done that did not help the RICH but only hard working Amer.

7512 2018-05-08 15:36:42 Pharma was started by the Rockefellers.  Oil barons trying to squeeze more profits out of oil derivatives. The elites also brought us the hollowed AMA, the org that single handedly suppressed, bought out or eliminated (killed) homeopathic doctors with real cures. It's all a farce
7513 2018-05-08 15:36:41 おや…？
7514 2018-05-08 15:36:36 So I’m getting my oil changed, right? And my phone keeps connecting to my car Bluetooth... I clicked on one of those sex clips on my tl and was wondering why I couldn’t hear it... y’all know the rest. I’m so embarrassed.

7527 2018-05-08 15:35:36 Who cares... the only reason Iran is a problem is because many of our allies are so financially tied into Iranian oil.  The minute we get confrontational, the allies will fall in line   Iran is a flee and we are the dog, sometimes you need a good bath and the problem is over
7528 2018-05-08 15:35:28 Just look at what oil did a few minutes ago. Continuity is on the table.
7529 2018-05-08 15:35:27 Ahead of President Trump @realDonaldTrump announcement on #Iran #Oil slides from nearly 4 year high -$2.48 to $68.25 #stocks turn mixed #Dow +6, #NASDAQ -3, #SP500 -1 Wake up to the latest @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
7530 2018-05-08 15:35:26 Cannabis oil over chemo any day. I’d much rather have a plant based oil circulate around my body than something derived from mustard gas. People should be more worried about the effects of cancer than a plant
7531 2018-05-08 15:35:18 Iran sells its oil under Iraqi paperwork(so sanctions are a joke), IRGC exports military advisors to Yemen/Central America/Lebanon, Iran does ICBM work for North Korea with Russian/Pakistani assistance.... so again.. .what did charade do functionally besides weaken US position?
7532 2018-05-08 15:35:10 They could have done if they’d decided it was philosophically and economically smart about 30 years ago. We could have bought half of infrastructure in D and Fr with our North Sea oil revenues. Blew it instead
7533 2018-05-08 15:35:01 ■CNN速報(米版)：The price of oil is plunging ahead of President Trump’s announcement on the Iran nuclear deal.
7534 2018-05-08 15:35:00 @thespybrief And cold feet among European and U.S. investors could herald a new boom for some Chinese companies, already major investors in Iran, where they have signed multi-billion dollar agreements in the oil, industrial and transportation sectors. /end
7535 2018-05-08 15:34:57 Thanks for a little oil lesson. I honestly don’t know much on that. Makes sense though.

7543 2018-05-08 15:34:25 I’m sorry, I know the previous scar bothers you; I’ll be holding good thoughts for speedy, healthy healing. Have you ever tried Lavender essential oil?

Yeah, maybe it's time I should get the oil changed...
7545 2018-05-08 15:34:18 Definitely out , they need the oil price high before the Saudi oil IPO.
7546 2018-05-08 15:34:17 either way they’re killing the orangutans harvesting all that palm oil

7554 2018-05-08 15:33:33 But how would oil companies giving consumers an indirect rebate on oil help reduce oil consumption?
7555 2018-05-08 15:33:27 Your calculations based on draft figure on @marinetraffic. First of all it is roughly figure of tanker and it is not %100 true. This size of tanker can carry 50 000 mt ballast when she is empty. At least 50 000 mt crude oil can be discharge on same draft.

7563 2018-05-08 15:31:57 the real is America makes a monster from iran to buy arabs oil in low price and sell them weapons in high price,

iranians are very kind, they invite any foreigner with out knowing u to their home, and feed u free or gift u from their shops
7564 2018-05-08 15:31:51 Oil prices dropped by 3% in MINUTES in anticipation of a smooth Iran deal withdrawal !
7565 2018-05-08 15:31:51 If you are oil bull you don’t want Iran to remove 3m/day supply.  Panic would ensue & OPEC supply deal would rightly break.  You want this steady depletion of inv and lack of investment.  Imho #OOTT.
7566 2018-05-08 15:31:51 In my opinion. @realDonaldTrump  is going to Say no deal to Iran, and so the oil prices will sky rocket. So what is he getting out of this?  Follow the money on who will profit from this on the Right?

7597 2018-05-08 15:29:41 It’s pretty mercenary but if Trump withdraws from the Iran deal and oil prices go up, at least people will stop buying stupid fucking gas guzzlers.
7598 2018-05-08 15:29:30 Hate getting my oil changed 
7599 2018-05-08 15:29:15 I don't see it ever getting to that point, with our current production levels, I think oil companies are pushing their luck at $70/barrel because I think it will push more production, which will load up supply, and again drive the price right back down.

7608 2018-05-08 15:28:28 Maybe I'm cynical, but I think Iran basically will undersell their oil to the Mark Rich's of the world, who will change a flag on a ship and not a lot is affected.  I think Trump huffs and puffs, so price ran up, then price will come off when we see it was mostly posturing.

7646 2018-05-08 15:24:54 Don't disagree with you there, also media reliant on oil advertising. Aim high is good, but practicalities need discussing too, so those sympathetic can be persuaded. Terraced house charging (& flats etc) a significant practical impediment.
7647 2018-05-08 15:24:52 IMO it's all surrounding central bank policy. If oil goes up, inflation goes up. Markets expect tighter policy so the dollar bids.

We've seen this thought the last couple years.

We'll see the dollar sell off when inflation drops because markets expect fed to hold.

7676 2018-05-08 15:22:54 @tdichristopher “Oil prices plunge after report that Trump will not withdraw from Iran nuclear deal”. Your article says nothing to support that claim. In fact, some parts say the exact opposite! Care to substantiate your headline for us here? You failed to do so in the article.
7677 2018-05-08 15:22:53 This gap in the PRice of Oil has as much to do with the landlocked nature of the tar sands ( pipeline capacity) as it does with the extra refining necessary to make it useful to the Chinese who are the ones wanting to buy  it at this discount.

7729 2018-05-08 15:19:37 What’s the point of not dumping oil in the gutter? What’s the point of not littering?

That is a sad, defeated excuse. Nothing would ever get accomplished with that thinking.
7730 2018-05-08 15:19:35 @realDonaldTrump, who favors nativist arguments and protectionism, doesn't need non-compliance w/ #IranDeal to support reimposing sanctions. ~500K BPD reduction in Iranian oil exports and corresponding increase in US shale production is reason enough for him to do it.
7731 2018-05-08 15:19:20 I alerted yesterday to going short oil. No brainer max move when it crossed $70/bbl. Love this market!
7732 2018-05-08 15:19:13 No lie I never felt better with my car going for an oil change and actually only needing an oil change.
7733 2018-05-08 15:19:13 @SenSanders so once again the market is being manipulated. Oil is dropping only for the 1% to buy cheap-like the last four weeks of the stock market. The administration causes unrest, prices fall, and then prices go back up because the wealthy have bought low. It’s just a con.
7734 2018-05-08 15:19:13 Not sure who that’s a dig at? But do you think it means teams which didn’t exist before oil money?
7735 2018-05-08 15:19:11 When oil was selling at $110/barrel for good 5 years you didn't demand for a "world class" healthcare. You were enjoying the looting then. Is it with empty treasury that you build a world class hospital?

7742 2018-05-08 15:18:54 Gas and oil prices at 4 year high.  Increasing tensions on Iran will raise then further.   Good thing our country implemented higher EPA efficiency standards.  Oh, wait... oops.
7743 2018-05-08 15:18:46 Iran has probably spent all my money the Kenyan gave them so they’re gonna need to keep selling the oil that’s getting pumped out from under their soil to cover “expenses.”

7760 2018-05-08 15:17:50 TRUMP TO MOVE ON SANCTIONS TO TARGET #IRAN'S OIL EXPORTS: CNN. #OOTT.  Isn't that kind of bullish?  lol
7761 2018-05-08 15:17:47 @AliVelshi Velchi&Rhuel  Don't we still owe Iran billions of dollars that is actually their money? I think he is trying to find a way to keep whatever money we owe them. You know money blinds him to common sense. Get the oil, and keep the money!!!
7762 2018-05-08 15:17:39 For instance, Trump is set to give his plans for Iran today.  If he chooses the neocon road, he'll rescind the nuclear deal and oil prices will spike, if he chooses to continue working with Iran, oil prices will drop.  This will have a profound effect on american consumers.

7767 2018-05-08 15:17:22 Reality is asserting itself. There was no reason for oil to be here to begin with. None of the Iran peddling has anything to do with supply and demand. The world is swimming in oil.

7787 2018-05-08 15:16:31 TRUMP Has Got To Find a Way To SKYROCKET OIL PRICES To $120 Dollars A Barrel Again.??
7788 2018-05-08 15:16:30 Oil down & defense up, makes sense. If we pull out of the Iran deal, oil has already priced this in (i.e. no material upside near term) & defense is WAY too cheap. If we stay in it, oil is probably too expensive & defense is STILL too cheap following the selling we saw last week.
7789 2018-05-08 15:16:23 Nothing that abstract. Russia wants higher oil prices. The JPCOA plus sanctions sent their economy into a tailspin
7790 2018-05-08 15:16:15 oil lower great for #turkey and USA not pulling totally out of deal good for Middle east and Turkey
7791 2018-05-08 15:16:12 Woah crude oil #BCO
7792 2018-05-08 15:16:08 This confuses me...If Iran is sanctioned, along with Trump's expected decertification today, part of Iran's oil may be taken off line. So why wouldn't that cause oil to rise, not fall???

7809 2018-05-08 15:14:41 What’s the worry? The only problem I foresee is the oil will go up. Hopefully, this will be timed with Bahrain getting online with their Khalij-al Bahrain new find (80 bln barrels, the size of all Russia’s oil reserves). The cheaper the oil the less money for dictators.
7810 2018-05-08 15:14:39 The collapse in Oil/XLE didn’t even matter
7811 2018-05-08 15:14:37 It's more than just oil changes. You have to think of preventative maintenance. Transmission, power steering, brakes. Grease your door joints and window seals. Do this at least once a year and your car and it's components will last a long time

7814 2018-05-08 15:14:32 #TRUMP this is how it works, the less oil you allow on the market the more you can charge$$ when sanctions were lifted on Iran by Obama they were allowed to sell their oil on the market which lowered the oil prices and gas prices at the pump! Good thing!

7820 2018-05-08 15:14:05 I don’t know. The national parks and monuments can be traced back to oil and mineral rights, for one example. Zinke moved immediately to peddle them, but last I heard, that was tied up in court. Same with the Dakota pipeline.

7823 2018-05-08 15:13:47 @MSNBC Hey Trump supporters his threat to pull out of the Iran deal has raised the price of oil and completely erased your tax cut and then some!

7825 2018-05-08 15:13:41 Mobbed up Presidency; no question GOP members involved. U.S. bailing on Iran nuclear deal means more Russian oil profit - Trump merely following orders from Putin. So obvious what's happening. GOP are complicit pigs.

7895 2018-05-08 15:09:03 The war on the Iran Deal is led by the Kochs and their oil industry pals who want the cost of importing  oil to go so high that the US government opens every inch of public land to drilling. We pay more at the pump while the Kochs rake it in.
7896 2018-05-08 15:09:03 $CL_F dying here. so someone knows something? Trump not leaving Iran deal? $USO vs $SPY imo. what's bad for oil is good for stocks.
7897 2018-05-08 15:09:01 While the original sin of the Constitution is enshrining slavery in the text, what allowed the acceptance of slavery is capitalism. Capitalism with its puffery (Breaking News!) accepted blindly is what tarnishes the free press and allows T to keep selling his snake oil.

7900 2018-05-08 15:08:43 It’s nothin to do with Modi, was stupid of you to imply that some how rupee will go up with Modi..its fluctuation in crude oil prices that devalues INR..stable or low oil in last 4-5 yrs untill recently hence u see petrol price rise& depreciation of RS. dont overvalue Modi ji

7908 2018-05-08 15:08:26 So , the professionals determined that oil and gas are a much better investment than renewables .... imagine that . This is hypicracy of the highest order ... but continue on with your spin .
7909 2018-05-08 15:08:23 now would be a good time for Gartman to reiterate his  "never see $44 oil in my lifetime" call
7910 2018-05-08 15:07:58 N producing oil..
7911 2018-05-08 15:07:50 ทำไงดีหนงเลือกไม่ได้
7912 2018-05-08 15:07:47 OIL PRICES  Already Up! When #Obama left Office GAS was under $3 per gallon...Now almost $4. @GOP Lobbyst for Big Oil Want to Break #IranDeal so they can raise prices more. WAKE UP @FoxBusiness Smell The SMOKE Tell the BASE Watch the PUMP  GO UP
7913 2018-05-08 15:07:45 Some one down the road has some working being done on there yard and the tractor needs oil badly and they are not fixing it and ever one in the neighborhood hates the sound.

7917 2018-05-08 15:07:17 Yeah you’re right about that. I don’t want to see gas hit $3/per gallon because of the optics but I do agree with you. I was reading about Russia pulling back on their crude oil production and the US producing most in over 40 years.
7918 2018-05-08 15:07:15 Going to attempt oil less Okro today.
7919 2018-05-08 15:07:13 so goes oil, so goes the market
7920 2018-05-08 15:07:12 Today is going to be long. Two shifts at work, an oil change, trip to the laundromat and don't forget Costco. Needless to say no stream tonight sorry guys.
7921 2018-05-08 15:07:12 2/but let's not forget that Shell's US$50 billion purchase of BG Group Plc and its 2016 pledge to divest of $36B of assets to pay for that purchase. Shell selling oil sands assets is a strategic corporate move, not a vote against Alberta.
7922 2018-05-08 15:07:09 Markets, especially oil, waiting on Trumps decision on the Iran deal.
7923 2018-05-08 15:07:05 Watch oil prices skyrocket after 2:00pm
7924 2018-05-08 15:06:58 @AOTtrades $ERY interesting..  Can oil just keep going up?
7925 2018-05-08 15:06:57 look out. #oil
7926 2018-05-08 15:06:56 It will push up the price of oil and the Russian mob government will like that.
7927 2018-05-08 15:06:54 Maybe his goal is to drive up oil prices to give Putin additional revenue
7928 2018-05-08 15:06:38 And yet, we’ve redoubled our efforts under Trump to rape and pillage our planet. 

If we focused on technologies based on these energy sources, we’d have little need for oil and natural gas, and we could let earth heal.
7929 2018-05-08 15:06:38 Have you tried coconut oil? I know it sounds redundant to apply oil when oily skin is the problem, but it generally kills germs and heals the skin very well. Exfoliating a lot triggers the skin to produce more oil, right after you do it apply the coconut oil.

7937 2018-05-08 15:06:02 1.

Nigeria under NOI obtained the highest revenue from oil sources, spent almost all revenues earned under GEJ, spent alot of the revenue saved from his predecessors, increased govt spending year on year, and its highest GDP per year growth equaled the worst GDP per growth .....
7938 2018-05-08 15:05:57 Rethread spool, rethread bobbin, check both tensions, dust & oil, make sure feed dogs are up. I've had similar problems magically fix themselves by trying all of that.
7939 2018-05-08 15:05:57 Trump will announce a decision on Iran today. 
1/2 

Let’s remember what the Iran deal really does for American interest. Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter rivals. Both boarder the Persian gulf and struggle for control of the strait of Hormuz (30% of global oil’s choke point).
7940 2018-05-08 15:05:50 NYC has made serious effort to clean up its air; moving to cleaner burning diesel buses in the early 2000s; restricting the use of the dirtiest fuel oil for space and water heating.  It has a long way to go, but it was much worse not too long ago.

7944 2018-05-08 15:05:23 And guess what? A $900 billion oil and natural gas well was discovered here not too long ago. We're only bound to become richer.
7945 2018-05-08 15:05:13 Trump has until Saturday to sign Iran deal. They're saying if he doesn't sign it there's going to be sanctions on the oil and prices are going to go Sky High.
7946 2018-05-08 15:05:05 Trump and the Iran deal: the key questions for the oil market
 
Concern about disruption to supply from Iran has helped drive crude prices higher

7948 2018-05-08 15:05:00 Canada will lose $15.8 Billion in potential revenue this year because of lack of pipelines according to latest study by @FraserInstitute.

7951 2018-05-08 15:04:50 oil will be fine.  I'm very sure that trump will give the middle finger to Iran and that oil will be 71 into the close.
7952 2018-05-08 15:04:43 Oil prices will rise, Iran will go back to a vigorous nuclear bomb program. Doofus turns a blind eye to Russia and China w a fixation on Iran simply because he wants to undo everything that Obama has negotiated. When Trump is gone will go back to the table again, oh well
7953 2018-05-08 15:04:31 Trouble for oil and gas when u start losing the buses and big rigs. There's always asphalt shingles...for a short time.
7954 2018-05-08 15:04:27 Oil prices will spike to 80 a barrel oh god!
7955 2018-05-08 15:04:20 Well unlike during Obama, the economy can actually handle $3/Gal, but at the same time if oil stays around $65-70/barrel that kicks in even more US production, which I think will get us back down to that $60 mark.

8030 2018-05-08 14:56:57 They've got oil, we don't.
8031 2018-05-08 14:56:55 It always starts with lies and fear tactics. Stifling development through sanctions, fomenting domestic racism, and applying military force allows the US and UK to profit through arms sales and oil, and Israel can continue its expansion into land owned by Palestinians.
8032 2018-05-08 14:56:46 Not at all, again so long as it is based on truth and reality of what Scotland will get/look like in independence then fine. (as opposed to the rather iffy projections of vast oil revenue)
8033 2018-05-08 14:56:42 Whaling would be good. Maybe you can sell the oil or something. I’d also like to see more sea monsters like the Kraken. A ghost ship would be highly welcome. Where if you defeat it, maybe you can steal the ship, and THAT ship is actually stronger than other ships. Until it sinks.

8036 2018-05-08 14:56:37 The oil futures market is the tool that central banks use to funnel money to the OPEC. The OPEC are a collective of deep state actors who then fund deep state groups like the #WhiteHelmets . The white hats create the illusion of terrorism using false flag events then MSM run it!
8037 2018-05-08 14:56:15 Good thing your pension plan doesn't invest in oil. Right John?

There, that oughtta calm those evangelical morons. Ghosts will save us! they aren't black!
8040 2018-05-08 14:56:01 There was so much hype and many people here to listen to oil and gas ministers at the National MPA Standards panel. Everyone was asking for sound scientific advise. As a scientist enters the room is empty.

8045 2018-05-08 14:55:26 Sanctions in Iran since 2004 have decimated the private sector. For all young people especially men, bread on table became tied to baton in hand. Sanctions created that space and enabled revolutionary guard to take over clothing, telecoms, oil and gas industries #SthlmForum

8069 2018-05-08 14:52:58 Exactly. But as happened here, that will, I am sure, change! But for now you are right! Oil prices are rising too. We pay $3.20 per gallon. In january I was in the UK and the petrol prices were 3 times more than I pay here! You have got a few 'whammy's' there!

8078 2018-05-08 14:52:27 @realDonaldTrump Sack IRAN deal oil prices crush Americans they crush GOP. For every reactionary their is an opposite counter reaction.
8079 2018-05-08 14:52:24 Oil should be a major consideration considering the recent rise at the pumps.
8080 2018-05-08 14:52:11 Venezuela would still be struggling if international sanctions were lifted. I don't think the fall in the price of oil is due to America.

Have you ever heard of OPEC?

And as far as I know, the US isn't bombing my native Venezuela.

8082 2018-05-08 14:51:58 @realDonaldTrump Fears saw oil prices climb above $70/barrel Monday for the first time since late 2014. Anticipation that the U.S. could reinstate sanctions on the country, which has become a major oil exporter since they were lifted in 2016, is worrying the global oil market.

8099 2018-05-08 14:50:45 The prize for crude oil was higher than 100 $ per barrel in 2014 then decreased to nearly 50 $ per barrel and the prizes never went down why? Now it's in 70$ range and they are increasing oil price . Do these people only know to increase the price?

8101 2018-05-08 14:50:44 We lose trust of all the other parties who were, in some cases, reluctantly pulled into the agreement. Russia and China gain strength in mid-east. Our oil prices go higher and stay higher. We gain nothing but trump gives Russia what they want. Also weakened in Korea talks.
8102 2018-05-08 14:50:42 I such a waste of oil!!!!
8103 2018-05-08 14:50:27 Agreed. The real rent seekers are those coal, oil and gas interests who use their huge influence within GOP to keep carbon price at zero and who also attack alternatives like ZECs and RECs as "subsidies." Orwellian

8110 2018-05-08 14:49:32 Originally USA long before ww2 had mostly all electric cars and trams, but oil companies bought up and destroyed trams and oil was cheaper for cars than electricity so people went from almost full electric to oil motors since it gave more range and faster/cheaper to refill.

8128 2018-05-08 14:47:21 Interesting convo with my Uncle who is a big shot in oil industry. I asked was it BPs fault for the Deep Water Horizon spill? He said BP and Shell are some of the most safest operating companies he worked with, they just unfortunately  had a disastrous blowout on the rig.

8147 2018-05-08 14:45:20 Iran news today matters to the avg person/business because if Trump chooses to exit nuclear deal (expected), sanctions would be reimposed, taking around 2MM barrels per day of Iranian oil off international markets, creating upward price pressure on oil and thus, gasoline prices.

8150 2018-05-08 14:44:49 I care. Guaranteed you're in some way a consumer of petroleum products. You should care too. By selling ethically produced CDN oil for more we can use the royalty revenue to invest in technologies that will save Planet A. Green energy isn't going to happen without investment.

8158 2018-05-08 14:44:02 Note to self: when someone tells you clove oil can help numb your skin tissue if you have to, for example, extract a deep, painful splinter, what they REALLY mean is OMG that part of you is not going to have ANY sensation in it whatsoever for a good, long while. #naturalmedicine
8159 2018-05-08 14:43:45 Stay course w Iran.We need oil.The Saudis want high prices.

8162 2018-05-08 14:43:34 Poor larxy. Coconut oil and aloe will help it fade and not peel as much
8163 2018-05-08 14:43:19 I'm gonna need the Arabs to pump the market with their oil again so prices can fall. 
8164 2018-05-08 14:43:12 put olive oil on a piece of cotton and keep it in your ear for some time
8165 2018-05-08 14:43:07 I’ve been here for an hour and a half for an oil change and free wash, b. Wtf is taking so long
8166 2018-05-08 14:43:06 Israel is ok having nuclear weapons as it supports US foreign policy, it’s enabling oil extraction in the Golan Heights (the oil is sold for US$ petrodollars). Iran sells it’s oil for € : US will find a reason to ‘intervene’. Renewable energy can end this conflict.
8167 2018-05-08 14:42:56 Damn tj max lines long as hell, but im gonna wait need some more beard oil, and they have it on sale
8168 2018-05-08 14:42:47 #Trump could open the door for posible future sanctions. Meanwhile he would have earned some time to negotiate with the rest of the world a new deal. It wont be the first time...   
#OOTT #Iran_Deal #Oil
8169 2018-05-08 14:42:28 Trump just wants oil prices to climb ..more corporate welfare at the cost of Americans
8170 2018-05-08 14:41:58 Pipe, y la reacción en el oil q????......sell the news?.......leo muchos q dicen q lo de iran lo sobrevaloro el mercado?....q opinas???
8171 2018-05-08 14:41:54 Speaking about diesel, sometimes it dawns on me that my Pops is married to an Arab. What a G.

Question is, how do we expropriate the oil?!!!!
8172 2018-05-08 14:41:51 “Next”? What did they invade for before? Middle East and Ottomans had spice trade control - which they exploited to the hilt - until Europeans developed ability to bypass them. You’re going to say oil but there was no invasion for that. As strategic commodity West had an interest
8173 2018-05-08 14:41:47 Females wit  in their twitter name squirt crude oil
8174 2018-05-08 14:41:25 I go to Canadian Tire for a couple hours in the weekend for a tire and oil change, now my phone's @Google app won't stop sending me notifications about deals and return policies and stuff for Canadian Tire... why?
8175 2018-05-08 14:41:24 #USD rallied while #oil dropped as traders braced themselves for #President #Donald #Trump's decision on the #Iran nuclear deal. #Stocks edged lower in the #US and Europe!

8177 2018-05-08 14:41:15 The Nuclear Treaty is keeping Iran from developing a Nuke. 
We see through your plan. Lower CAFE standards, so we use  more gas. Put sanctions back on Iranian oil so gas goes to $5.00 a gal. 
A win for the Koch bros and all your petro billionaire buddies.

8186 2018-05-08 14:40:31 This cod liver oil pill making me feel sick
8187 2018-05-08 14:40:29 The biggest thing is that the clutch is being replaced, but they're also replacing my serpentine belt, smoothing out my flywheel, and a whole bunch of normal things like oil and inspection.
8188 2018-05-08 14:40:28 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames. Bye spiders!
8189 2018-05-08 14:40:28 These Republicans always make the price of oil skyrocket. I hate how they fawn over big business and don't give a flying f*ck about how much we have to pay to keep their business friends happy. Nixon, Ford, Reagan, both Bushes and now Trump = expensive oil.
8190 2018-05-08 14:40:28 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー

8193 2018-05-08 14:40:07 Potential US decision to waive sanctions on Iran poses significant upside risk to the oil price. SA headline inflation would average 5.0% in 2018 if oil averages US$80/bbl, prompting the SARB to act if a prolonged period of above-target inflation results.
8194 2018-05-08 14:39:51 I use Crisco (& other brands) which has cottonseed oil in it. Never have sticking problem. I use cottonseed oil in my brownies too. Also cook with olive oil.
8195 2018-05-08 14:39:42 Rockefeller didn't find oil
sitting on his ass so 
get off your's
8196 2018-05-08 14:39:36 #BursaNews:  @Pemex y otras compañías, como Sierra Oil & Gas, firmaron contratos con la Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos, que las acredita como dueñas de los bloques subastados por las autoridades mexicanas @CNH_MX
8197 2018-05-08 14:39:32 I love them as nuts. Anything remotely flavoured with oil, powder or the milk. Foul beyond belief.
8198 2018-05-08 14:39:19 Buy oil now! #WTI
8199 2018-05-08 14:39:15 I assume NTV will be including interview with @seamap about need for stronger MPA rules, to balance pro oil message coming from Premier and his ministers seeking to undermine new MPAs. Didn't see any NTV tweets about the other presentations arguing for stronger MPAs yesterday

8201 2018-05-08 14:39:06 Beware ! Oil is nearly $70 a barrel! This airline could be in trouble soon !
8202 2018-05-08 14:39:04 Which is exactly my point, the invasion wasn’t wrong the sticking around after was.  Should of planned elections and gotten the hell out. Unfortunately the securing of oil fields was too high of a priority.
8203 2018-05-08 14:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
8204 2018-05-08 14:38:59 Thanks ! In the case of Venezuela, sad to see we don't have leaders smart enough to find solutions so Venezuela People can build a smart Future, instead of Crisis that benefits only the usual Vulture Hedge Funds,Oil speculators, #OPEC & War Profiteers. No talent available ?
8205 2018-05-08 14:38:58 Actually from what is being reported, investors were very nervous regarding oil prices so....
8206 2018-05-08 14:38:57 We haven’t matched yet!  But I know I can provide a stable home. I will have 6 of these man’s babies, then have 6 more. I’ll delete my Twitter and change my name. I’ll rub oil through his beard. I’ll cook, clean, and wash.

8210 2018-05-08 14:38:41 Little shocked the markets dont seem to care that trump is pulling out of Iran deal.  This could have huge consequences on oil and overall mid east stability.

8214 2018-05-08 14:37:27 Conditions for exit via IPO are improving.  By my count more than 10 or so oil & gas companies are lined up to IPO in the next 5 mos.  Too much focus on backwardation given way to the thought that prices have stabilized, impacting E&P, OFS, andMidstream players in a positive way.

8216 2018-05-08 14:37:20 This is all about oil. To do that the USA needs a war. Can't have war if you got a nuclear deal.

8218 2018-05-08 14:37:10 this isn't supposed to be an indictment of religion, btw. 

you can believe in whatever god(s) you want, rather i think it's an insult to plenty of religious people to tell them god spoke to you to tell you to vote on a bill about oil or some dumb shit.
8219 2018-05-08 14:37:07 *Excepting oil produced in #Scotland where it is worthless as *everybody* knows. It's only of value when it reaches London,
8220 2018-05-08 14:36:55 Cole and Thug on tour. That’s like oil and water.
8221 2018-05-08 14:36:49 ... I have given numbers from the AB gov financials to back my position, that is, Alberta has historically invested nearly total of its economy into oil...
8222 2018-05-08 14:36:43 i honestly do not understand hardcore solo stans. yes you can praise about your idol but don’t bring others down. they are human too yeah? you don’t see oil coming out of their ears. we love who we love, don’t hate.
8223 2018-05-08 14:36:39 The episode description starts with “VICE News gained access”, oh, was this difficult. did u have to burn the midnight oil to elbow your way in there. Because there are so many other people knocking down the door. Give me a break
8224 2018-05-08 14:36:35 You keep doing you. Clearly you have some reflecting to do. 

But I’m not here for your conspiracy theories and parroting of Rich’s snake oil.
8225 2018-05-08 14:36:28 Yes because of international crude oil price and not the (8)pm effect
8226 2018-05-08 14:36:08 Just noticed something... Interesting. Why does coconut oil have more calories than butter. I would have expected it to be the other way around

8233 2018-05-08 14:35:21 I'm bad at talking today. I'm pretty sure the oil change guys think I'm high. Spoiler alert: I'm not.

8235 2018-05-08 14:35:16 @KellyannePolls  tell president  he is doing a great job. Proud of you. May make a suggestion please remain in the agreement but apply harsh sanctions on central bank  some officials,oil export. $ is 7300 Tomans today. It would get people out easier and love you too. Thank you
8236 2018-05-08 14:35:16 Thanks @Dawny_Aguele for coming. The message says you have a Free diagnostic with repair. For example for an oil change service, we do a free diagnostic service and you don't have to pay for that. Only diagnostic service attracts a fee. Thanks for your understanding.
8237 2018-05-08 14:35:01 The Saudis have already vowed to slow production to raise prices. Sanctioning Iranian oil will only raise prices more. No I don’t whine and cry over Trump but this deal puts the brakes on ME war and if the deal is broken by Iran, then we have a legitimate reason for action.
8238 2018-05-08 14:34:52 Why is the price of oil and gas skyrocketing? It's higher than it's been in 3 years. Why did it reach new low prices under President Obama, but once you got into office it started going up again? Is that winning? Maybe for Big Oil, but not for the American people!
8239 2018-05-08 14:34:51 At this point it doesn't matter what Venezuela, Trump or ARAMCO do. the prices will keep going up. when was the last big field discovery ? my point is oil cost is higher for both, buyers and sellers.
8240 2018-05-08 14:34:42 That’s true. I’m a bit irritated about that. It’s because the first minister is Scottish National Party. She wants independance. But the oil prices have dropped and Scotland can’t afford independence now.
8241 2018-05-08 14:34:29 Iran deal is about oil not Nukes, A year ago oil was $42 today $70 The US and the world have a balanced supply of oil, risk of conflict in the mideast has a direct impact on oil prices!  The Saudi's  want oil at $100  Trump's first overseas trip was to Saudi Arabia! Deal?
8242 2018-05-08 14:34:12 @SpeakerRyan Mr. speaker you are doing a great job. Proud of you. May make a suggestion please remain in the agreement but apply harsh sanctions on central bank  some officials,oil export. $ is 7300 Tomans today. It would get people out easier and love you too. Thank you

Thank you
8245 2018-05-08 14:33:38 Guns, Guns Guns is that all you have to talk about? Hillary took money from the polluting oil companies poisoning our air and water while Senator Sanders has fought them all his career. Climate Change threatens us all and Hillary was on the side of the polluters.
8246 2018-05-08 14:33:35 Please reflect on the fact you’re buying the snake oil that Rich is selling and spewing baseless accusations. 

Some of Rich’s positions are nothing more than the bare minimum for any rational human being right now. Others are straight out of GOP handbook.
8247 2018-05-08 14:33:33 More important for provincial state revenue and big oil interests than direct employment, old path dependencies persist.
8248 2018-05-08 14:33:21 On the world market and lower prices at the pump. When OPEC tactics didn’t crush US production (we are now exporting) OPEC agreed A YEAR AGO to limit production to stabilize oil prices (higher prices) it took a little over a year for the gasoline excess to be used and prices rise
8249 2018-05-08 14:33:14 $100 oil is 'stable market' for Saudi Arabia.

8252 2018-05-08 14:32:41 Mais um que devia falar que petróleo iria a “zero”. Em

8255 2018-05-08 14:32:38 #WR Analysis: Oil prices continue high! @Reuters: “Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday, a day after hitting 3-1/2 year highs, as investors braced for the D. Trump’s decision on whether to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could disrupt global oil supply.”
8256 2018-05-08 14:32:37 finally switched to my summer face oil I forgot how amazing grapeseed oil is. It's so light and helps get rid of acne and scars.

8259 2018-05-08 14:31:17 I need to do dishes, do laundry, do a meet and greet, get an oil change, and try not to die all before Friday! With three 8-12 hour work shifts!!!
8260 2018-05-08 14:31:07 Just started a new variation of the Clinique toner because of you increase accumulation of oil as it gets warmer so I’m testing to see which variation is better for me.

8264 2018-05-08 14:30:36 You, along with most Americans have no understanding of economics or world trade. Gas prices fell when OPEC (mainly Saudi Arabia) refused to limit production and drive prices down to put US oil production out of business (specifically fracking) this led to a glut of gasoline
8265 2018-05-08 14:30:35 @SquawkStreet @carlquintanilla I disagree w/ur energy "experts" who DO NOT UNDERSTAND TRUMP.  I expect @realDonaldTrump TO ALREADY HAVE ENERGY PRODUCERS/SHALE/ALLIES LINED UP to make up for loss of Iran oil. IRAN SHUDNT ABLE TO SELL OIL WHILE THEY PROMOTE TERROR/KILL US SOLDIERS

8268 2018-05-08 14:30:20 Right?! This is ridiculous...next time, I’m at least doing the oil change myself, lol.
8269 2018-05-08 14:30:18 Our country's revenue which used to heavily depended on oil. Tax such as personal income and corporate. All of these are not sufficient to allow us afford those Scandinavian model.
8270 2018-05-08 14:30:14 Same! But I was at my parents house and they have a convection cook top so there's no risk of fire if you splash the oil. That helped me relax a LOT!
8271 2018-05-08 14:30:09 Inexpensive alternative; sugar & any carrier oil in your house (olive, coconut, castor etc). 
8) Mask, once or twice for the week, I use glam glow travel set masks (greatttt but pricey), check out the Freeman line, $35.95 at Pennywise
9) Invest in an acne spot control cream...
8272 2018-05-08 14:30:09 Oil -1.5%
8273 2018-05-08 14:30:07 Do you know people that are always looking for great coconut oil.. like are people always in need of it?
8274 2018-05-08 14:30:05 @seamap were @TRobertst and @daniellebarron there to cover your presentation to the MPA panel yesterday or only reporting the pro oil drilling presentation by the Premier and his entourage of ministers trying to undermine stronger MPA rules?
8275 2018-05-08 14:30:02 Where was the dollar at when oil was that price and what about the additional taxes? Agree the oil companies are taking advantage but Wynne was warned about applying the carbon tax. But she did not listen.

8278 2018-05-08 14:29:50 Plastic will decompose in 400-1000 years. Probably decomposes back to oil. So future paleontologists might find cavities (molds and casts) of our plastic objects.

8280 2018-05-08 14:29:31 It will close but you will re open it again,but it wouldn't really hurt..just oil it well before you do
8281 2018-05-08 14:29:20 Keep in mind with Iran, US imports 0 oil and products from Iran.  Unless other countries follow US and impose more oil related sanctions, then this Iran thing is a nonevent.

8286 2018-05-08 14:28:35 Shell oil wants the carbon tax because carbon tax distributes the externalized cost of their business across all of Canada, instead of having the profiting party (Shell) pay.

8288 2018-05-08 14:28:26 So now you don’t want oil revenue?

8293 2018-05-08 14:28:00 I agree. If it is pure (and the fillers and binders used to make up tablets of it not either toxic or problematic), ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is just ascorbic acid. If one could make the stuff out of crude oil or vegemite, as long as it was pure when the consumer gets it, fine.
8294 2018-05-08 14:27:50 Lol yes! Been sitting here at the tire shop for 2 1/2 hours for new tires and an oil change.
8295 2018-05-08 14:27:43 Everyone knows that oil tycoon passwords should include a reference to the Beverly Hillbillys.
8296 2018-05-08 14:27:37 @SenateGOP Trump move on IRAN will send oil prices in a shock wave.
8297 2018-05-08 14:27:37 Horrible situation, that adds to same circumstances in other countries, not only Venezuela. See Peru, Bresil, where indigenous people suffer persecution or die because of oil companies' activities or big hidroelectric projects, which destroy environment. That must be signaled too

8301 2018-05-08 14:27:22 I mean, the entire sane culture living in modernity thinks theyre a bunch of ignorant rubes and cynical snake oil salesmen, to a one. Maybe that's what they mean, is that their ridiculous beliefs are freely ridiculed.

8304 2018-05-08 14:27:16 Ask for the cash back which Obama gave? or Have Iran ship some crude oil to California at a great deal.
8305 2018-05-08 14:27:15 Anyone in anticipation of Trump's decision on #IranDeal just follow the market (crude oil, ...) and follow the money to find the true reason for eventual withdrawal. Oh, and BiBi, of course... #IranNuclearDeal
8306 2018-05-08 14:27:13 @DJ_SEBAS Yeah the battle is intense. I see ppl calling for $1500 gold are bullish on Oil. Thats one good sign for bears 
8307 2018-05-08 14:27:07 OILの行く末
8308 2018-05-08 14:27:01 In 2018, dollar is killing EMs. Oil is killing some EMs--Turkey, India. But dollar is the big story. Even India and Turkey can handle rising oil if the dollar is contained.
8309 2018-05-08 14:26:59 Putin's puppet will pull us out of the deal today, because that's what Putin wants.  Oil prices will go up and our allies will be pissed we discarded the agreement.

8313 2018-05-08 14:26:40 I don't. I've thought about getting one, but I pan fried it. My parents get Plated every week and I go over and cook with them and they had schnitzel on the menu. I had never fried anything before with actual hot oil
8314 2018-05-08 14:26:38 The KM Expansion (Yes, it's a twinning for a 50+ y/o pipeline) fails to go through. That will leave us reliant on the refined products from Washington State, still made from Albetta oil, but shipped back via barge.

Like I said, it's complex.
8315 2018-05-08 14:26:28 @SenateDems Trump slams IRAN, oil prices sky rocket. You better have an ad charging what (GOP) can't deny.
8316 2018-05-08 14:26:19 Epsom Salt And Olive Oil flush dat right out dawg
8317 2018-05-08 14:26:14 New sanctions by trump will drive up oil prices. That is trump's true goal.
8318 2018-05-08 14:26:10 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
8319 2018-05-08 14:26:10 I think oil companies are taking a temporary hit on their margins. They will make up their losses after elections.

8321 2018-05-08 14:26:00 This heat wave got my face producing 1 liter of oil a day
8322 2018-05-08 14:25:58 If Trump pulls out if Iran Deal the cost of Oil will skyrocket. A war in the Middle East may ensue. Trump is doing this out of hatred for Obama and love of Israel. Never mind the security of the American people.

8332 2018-05-08 14:24:34 Venezuela’s loss of production is one of the major factors helping to push oil prices to the highest levels in three years. As I indicated in Barring Major Reforms, Venezuela’s Oil Industry Is Finished, it doesn’t look like the situation is going to improve anytime soon.

8336 2018-05-08 14:24:06 If Trump pulls out of Iran deal, oil prices go up so Saudi & Russia benefit. 

China, the biggest importer of Iran's oil, can still buy it using a Chinese bank already under US sanctions. 

EU suffers most but will take comfort from having a 'special relationship' with US...
8337 2018-05-08 14:24:05 Another HUGE weekend at the #newboernedodge !  We are very thankful you chose our dealership.  Remember we have a great Service Department!  See you all for your first free oil change!

8339 2018-05-08 14:23:59 In MY NKJV Mark 14 someone complained about the cost of the anointing oil a woman poured over Jesus’ head. verse 7: “For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me.” Read it again, you’re conflating scripture.
8340 2018-05-08 14:23:58 The U.S. firm ConocoPhillips targeted facilities on the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of Venezuela’s oil exports last year. The three play key roles in processing, storing and blending PDVSA’s oil for export

8345 2018-05-08 14:23:15 U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to three sources familiar with its actions.

8358 2018-05-08 14:21:54 Come on guys. I guess the oil companies have not told you that North America is self sufficient in oil? I guess they must have a motive for hiding that fact. Wonder what it is??
8359 2018-05-08 14:21:51 So does anybody else see Trump causing oil and gas prices to skyrocket over the Iran deal which hurts the US but helps Russia? This is no coincidence but of course the dotards don't care cause MAGA!!

8367 2018-05-08 14:21:15 And it was stunningly clear he was out of his depth in the discussion. Maybe that was the point? Shined a light on the logical thought process and lack of historical knowledge that is driving the anti-Iran sentiment. Death of Iran deal = more expensive oil.

8388 2018-05-08 14:19:38 You are terribly misinformed to the point where it’s obvious another war in the ME is unavoidable as well as another recession because our economy and the rest of the world relies on oil. This pull out of the deal will surely get Saudi Arabia’s wishes of 80+$ a barrel of oil.
8389 2018-05-08 14:19:23 Oil pulls the dollar up and that makes the rupee cheap which is good for exports and overall dollar reciepts which is good for purchasing oil and out security. Economics 101 . #nowyouknow

8395 2018-05-08 14:18:29 Please cancel it so the oil prices skyrocket and then your typical supporter won't be able to afford to drive to the polls in November.
8396 2018-05-08 14:18:23 And that is mostly the result of low oil prices, and major companies acknowledging the market is changing and they want in on that change. Had the PCAA focussed on divesting our economy, we’d already be leaders in other industries. #ableg

8414 2018-05-08 14:16:36 But, you know ,oil prices will jump and some friends will make money on sanctions. Lots of money, lots of money! No planet to spend it on , but - lots of money!

8419 2018-05-08 14:16:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and left to bleed to death in his home.
8420 2018-05-08 14:16:05 Remember when everyone got all excited about the few extra bucks in their pocket...well that's gone now with oil prices.

8431 2018-05-08 14:14:41 Ja polecam. Szczególnie płyny micelarne i żele do twarzy, szczególnie z serii green, najlepszy jest ten oil, chociaż powstałe też są spoko. Miałam też krem pod oczy i do twarzy, ale nie zauważyłam jakiegoś szczególnego działania

8437 2018-05-08 14:14:15 ...is it?? I thought people cooked with olive oil v. like canola oil bc it's "healthier" but I didn't realize there was an evoo/non-evoo "health" based argument. evoo is for salad applications, regular oo is for sauteing, other oil is for high heat

8450 2018-05-08 14:13:20 Putin’s a pretty-big fan of communism: without it, he couldn’t have doled out the previously-collectivized RU assets (land/real estate/oil/minerals/etc.) of the collapsed USSR, handing them over to the elite oligarchic members of the “United Russia” Party.
8451 2018-05-08 14:13:19 Is there a chance he's walking away from the deal to make oil prices go up and make Putin happy by doing so? I can't really think of any other reason he could have.

8486 2018-05-08 14:10:53 Why cant we just keep  doing what we have been doing  without the pipelines and exclude foreign oil from oir donestic markets and focus on trans american trade and employlots of train and truck drivers?

8527 2018-05-08 14:06:47 @realDonaldTrump The sanctions coming up for continued waivers this week are key. If they were reimposed, they would penalize countries or companies buying oil from Iran by making it hard for them to do business with U.S. banks and markets.
8528 2018-05-08 14:06:43 What can we expect from the price of oil after Trump's Iran decision? We'll discuss that to open today's show. #oilprices
8529 2018-05-08 14:06:38 You're going to have to define what perfect socialism is before anyone should agree with you. Also, it's pretty clear that the dramatic fall in oil prices triggered the decline in Venezuela. That and a cult of personality around the leader...ahem ahem.

8539 2018-05-08 14:05:35 That marine environmental stewardship is viewed as an "industry" and, there is a question of its compatibility with the offshore oil & gas industry speaks volumes to the core problem we have. On both sides of the narrative.
8540 2018-05-08 14:05:16 Point of correction. The price of oil as of today is $78 Per barrel. Stop misinforming people. GEJ inherited economic mess that has been in place for over 40 years and managed to turn it around within three years. Under GEJ Nigeria became the fastest growing economy in The world.

Having diarrhea and vomiting is normal.  As long as they're coming out the right holes. If things get crossed, call a plumber.

In case of pea soup, call an exorcist & eat him. They're very calming for the tummy, especially smudged in sage oil.

8558 2018-05-08 14:03:47 Yes I have heard about miso and soya sauce. I do like soya sauce. Pickled vegetables seem to be quite different from here..how do you make it there? Its usually with oil here. Like mustard oil along with salt & spices

8566 2018-05-08 14:03:03 1) We sell arms to Saudi Arabia and Israel which negates your first point. 
2) That sanction relief lets more oil into the market keeping prices down.        3) Why not revisit the deal in when it sunsets seeing as its working.

8584 2018-05-08 14:01:49 You are an idiot. The international community will rightly never trust us again. What oil companies have paid you to raise oil prices?

8600 2018-05-08 14:00:42 @POTUS one thing Obama knew - keep oil prices low.
8601 2018-05-08 14:00:40 EPA rules were meant to save the planet and cure our nasty habit of consuming middle eastern oil that funds terrorism. Pruitt took that all away & was likely paid handsomely by fossil fuel companies. Now we’re having SUV’s shoved down our throat & gas prices are rising quickly

8604 2018-05-08 14:00:26 OKAY SO I JUST CALLED THAT @jiffylube AND THEY LITERALLY DID TAKE MY OIL. Literally how does someone confuse a brand new, full, sealed bottle of oil with remainder oil? Absolutely ridiculous. Never going there again. 
8605 2018-05-08 14:00:25 Yes.. can’t be falling asleep behind the wheel .. you have that beautiful baby to be taking care of .. rest and vitamins .. soak in epson salt and stuff to relax the body.. eucalyptus and lavender oil .. lemme get you right one time !
8606 2018-05-08 14:00:22 It remains to be seen if NK dis-arms. China agreed to stop selling them oil and we found out China is giving NK oil. This proves NK and China are allies and consider us the enemy.

8615 2018-05-08 13:59:26 you need something oil based for it to count as vinaigrette. This recipe is just wrong

8617 2018-05-08 13:59:17 Remember re today’s Iran announcement: 180-day “significant reduction” period under CBI’s oil import sanctions. Required under law & good idea in helping stabilize oil markets. 180-day period put into original law at a time of high oil prices to reassure the market.

8622 2018-05-08 13:58:29 You have President Dump that will more than likely cut the Iran deal as Obama made it. Gas and oil will sky rocket. Air flights will be much higher over the gas. Does Dump even think? I don't believe so. Yeah Dump a great leader HA! He's a fucking idiot
8623 2018-05-08 13:58:28 I'm craving one I discovered at a deli in NJ years ago: roast beef, fresh mozzarella slices, roasted red peppers, arugula, Italian bread. Very simple. Sometimes I do a shot of olive oil and red wine vinegar, sometimes not.

8628 2018-05-08 13:57:53 Do understand the dynamics of international market on crude oil. 60+ years still no proper oil reserve to tackle these kind of hostage situation. The present government is in talks with other developing economies to start massive oil reserve.

8636 2018-05-08 13:56:45 CBD oil isn't a cure all for everything, I still have to use the same drugs as before for my symptoms, but less of them.  But it helps with sleep, which helps with everything.  It helps with anxiety and seizures.

8638 2018-05-08 13:56:43 If the US pulls out of the Iran nuke deal oil prices will rise but that isn't the sole or even the most important reason for withdrawing. Israel, KSA and the US formed an alliance in May 2017 in Riyahd against Iran, Hezbollah and Syria. Some may have noticed Israel's bellicosity

8641 2018-05-08 13:56:35 Still don't know or understand why we are getting so much oil from Iran, we have been told repeatedly that the U.S. has been or will soon be one of the largest oil producers in the world so why can we just not use our own oil?

8643 2018-05-08 13:56:27 Also There was a time where you could not drill for oil in the Everglades but oil companies put in legislation 30 years ago where  they can drill in 5 years
8644 2018-05-08 13:56:16 Is it my imagination or is @redbox raising prices faster than the oil industry?

8670 2018-05-08 13:53:24 The problem is politicians don't care. Oil may be a diminishing resource. But, it's not diminishing enough that it can't provide politicians with generational wealth, stashed in offshore accounts. When oil finishes, we move to solid minerals, then agric commodities.
8671 2018-05-08 13:53:23 Gas prices headed up.   Works out well for the US who have become number one oil producer / exporter

8697 2018-05-08 13:50:40 I Run to the gas station to stock up on fuel since oil prices hit $70 a barrel. Price per gallon dropped 15 cents after I filled my car and 3 gas cans. What can you do

8699 2018-05-08 13:50:19 You sure like to attack people, let’s look at your performance:
Jobs 1st 12 months down 13k per month on average
March /April 2018 missed the forecast by 120k Jobs
Tax break gave away over trillion $
Deficit went from $500B to over a Trillion
Health care cost soaring
Oil up 120%
8700 2018-05-08 13:50:18 Rant of the day: any Native person against oil - maybe don't show your status card and pay 21.7 cents per litre less to fill your Mercedes 250 SL than I do to fill my 4 Cyl GMC Terrain.
8701 2018-05-08 13:50:17 Coconut oil! Every night before you sleep for a week. Your hair will be nasty and greasy af, but extra soft when you're done. Also maybe just cut half an inch off or less. That way you don't lose length, but can still help your hair be a little healthier
8702 2018-05-08 13:50:12 Hmmmm. Being served when? Goat Cheese, Asparagus, Fennel + Rosemary please! Truffle oil or balsamic drizzle. Dry white wine w/ friends. Cheers! #fresh #pizza
8703 2018-05-08 13:50:09 So the dirty oil we get from the middle east that has no regulations and is brought here through waterways is a better alternative ???  We are 100 years away from being off Fossil Fuels so in the meantime the pipeling IS the responsible thing to do. Trains and tankers not safe

8706 2018-05-08 13:49:50 It begs the question, will countries who continue business with Iran be punished by Trump? If sanctions are re-imposed against Iranian oil exports, pressure will mount on the supply and price of oil. 2/4

8719 2018-05-08 13:48:53 The price of oil has been going up ever since Trump got in office the price of gas going higher and higher every time you stop to fill up all thanks to Trump.

8832 2018-05-08 13:37:11 Apparently the rising price of oil will more than offset all the money saved in #TaxCuts for our lowest income earners.  #NPR.  SAD. @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump

8834 2018-05-08 13:36:59 ou não ...

dependendo do que for, oil vai nos $72 e ela explode !
8835 2018-05-08 13:36:50 This is a short-sighted view. Stability is good for the economy and oil prices and stability is the most effective anti-terror tool there is. Terrorists thrive on instability.
8836 2018-05-08 13:36:47 I hope you are correct of course. But it's not just 9% of revenues (although 9% seems big enough), it is (already) rising prices for fuel and the potential for populations to wonder if the #oil money was squandered (even if it can be argued it wasn't). #Mexico #energy
8837 2018-05-08 13:36:45 1. power usage has NEVER gone down with population INCREASE.
2. Oil Lobbyists LOVE to have public hydro be shut down for oil/gas pipelines anyday
3. 110k foreign students, not including normal immigration comes here PER YEAR.

8840 2018-05-08 13:36:17 US export growth in 17 lagged China -- manufactured exports no longer falling v GDP, but not rising either.

Better to a positive than a negative no doubt, but think recovery in US manufacturing more tied to recovery in oil cap ex, which tends to make heavy use of US equipment
8841 2018-05-08 13:36:15 I’m looking at 68.5/69 then early 70s. Then some decent downside. Iran is over baked into oil price now

8856 2018-05-08 13:34:58 Oil just hit a 4 year high! Currently retail gas prices have gone up about 35 cents per gallon. If you drive 18000 miles per year that is an additional $250 per year in expense if your car gets 20 mpg. For many, that eats up their couple extra bucks from the #GOPTaxScam . #MAGA
8857 2018-05-08 13:34:52 Oh god...I feel for your daughter. Must be driving her crazy. Make sure the peppermint essential oil is the deal real. Also look into stinging nettle. Very effective. I'm lucky enough to have a neighbour who's into fleur bach and essential oils.

8885 2018-05-08 13:31:56 I think before Canadians make a judgment on Us politics, the should look at there Politics. Your dollar is .77 to our dollar. It was  Trump that got the oil pipeline going through the US.
8886 2018-05-08 13:31:53 If he withdraws and reimposes restrictions on Iran’s oil exports he will create leverage that Kerry gave up at beginning. That leverage can be used to negotiate a better deal. We are here because they made an unconscionably bad deal.

8897 2018-05-08 13:31:16 Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems that the little individual tax cut had been undermined the the rise in gas, which is causing food prices to go up.  The only one who wins are those corporations, and the Russians,  who economy largely depends on oil.

8953 2018-05-08 13:25:45 The Win Win scenario for Trump cancelling Iran deal= 
1. While US exports oil, US oil companies who already got bigly tax breaks will make obscene profits raising prices at the pumps.
2. Higher prices at gas pumps= more tax $.
There goes your tax break!

8965 2018-05-08 13:24:36 @SRuhle In the larger context of the Sunni/Shia struggle, one could see U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal as part of an effort to aid Saudi Arabia by causing oil prices to rise to levels required to sustain the Saudi Arabian economy.

8969 2018-05-08 13:23:49 Trump definitely work n for a very big PUSH on Crude Oil Supply Decline forcing prices up threatening to cut Iran Treaty. Trump wants a war in Middle-East & Geopolitical APPLICATIONS! Trump Supporters WANT to pay more for GASOLINE!
8970 2018-05-08 13:23:46 Some men prefer an unscented oil so it doesn't clash with they're aftershave.
8971 2018-05-08 13:23:46 The price of oil, already going up because of the impending sanctions deadline, would rise further, increasing gasoline prices and cancelling out the benefits of the Trump tax cuts for middle and lower-income Americans.

8974 2018-05-08 13:23:28 That's what Putin wants, instability to raise oil prices.
8975 2018-05-08 13:23:26 That’s exactly what I said I read a report after the vote was lost stating that they have found the potential for double the oil we have already sold still lies under the North Sea that’s exactly why they started the no campaign to keep us wi disinformation and lies!
8976 2018-05-08 13:23:25 So Trump and cronies will profit greatly since they are heavily invested in oil. To hell with the rest of us and the world as long as his family and friends profit greatly.
8977 2018-05-08 13:23:21 @saidykhan08 Research shows Dioxin is an active chemical used in Fish oil extraction which has adverse effects on the environment and humans, what your take on this?

8978 2018-05-08 13:23:18 Assad? Elected president of Syria. Is it strange that the US has a pattern of going after 'bad guy dictators' in oil rich regions? Is Libya better off? Iraq? Afghanistan? Stop drinkin that Koolaid Donna! Truth is most Syrians believe Assad to the best option for a stable Syria.

8980 2018-05-08 13:23:07 We lose on more levels than oil. We lose in the international arena; we lose when the region becomes even more destabalized; we lose b/c we can't keep our word.  WE LOSE!
8981 2018-05-08 13:22:55 rough ride but last forever. have a 9400t and never had any issues just top up the oil thats it. even our challenger. has been great only 2000hrs tho

Who would benefit from higher oil prices?

8985 2018-05-08 13:22:39 I don’t think Mexico is a good example @robert__gibbons . Oil revenues are less than 9% of total revenues and I won’t say that it is an “unstable economy”.

8988 2018-05-08 13:22:29 However we will suffer the consequences. Islam and Christianity are like oil and water with different cultures, ideologies and their disregard for the laws of the countries they enter, polar opposite to the way we are expected to follow those of muslim countries

8990 2018-05-08 13:22:18 Considering Trump owns 19.5% of Rosneft Oil, a reward from Putin & Russia for colluding ( per the dossier), he too will be making billions.
8991 2018-05-08 13:22:01 Australia is too lazy to put an effort on extracting it’s own oil! We have plenty but that’s not how big boys get rich and stay rich, need to make things more in demand and less accessible in order to keep that money rolling in!

8997 2018-05-08 13:21:22 But you can't really articulate the "damage" anyway.  What's damaging about Iran no longer having a nuclear program? Bad for oil companies?
8998 2018-05-08 13:21:18 I had an oil painting drying in the art room and I went to go grab it just to find that someone had swiped their finger through it... thanks for ruining my piece and now I have one less painting for my portfolio... thank you so much...
8999 2018-05-08 13:21:15 The problem with Venezuela is that it was a petroleum based economy which collapsed when the oil prices dropped.

9010 2018-05-08 13:20:02 @realDonaldTrump The EPA and @EPAScottPruitt have been handing oil refiners plenty of wins.  How about a win for the ethanol industry and corn farmers across this great nation? #RFSWorks

No more Kichri Sarkar please. There is no one leader or party who can perform better at this stage. Spare us.
9013 2018-05-08 13:19:43 Russia is entirely reliant on its oil industry.

Any action Trump takes which increases the price of oil, helps Russia. 

Watch oil prices after Trump scuttles the Iran deal.

9019 2018-05-08 13:18:50 #IranDeal If you want higher oil prices, then let's hope the deal this canceled since it'll shut off Iran's spigots and give Saudi Arabia the upper hand. #FollowTheMoney
9020 2018-05-08 13:18:47 I recognize that but I believe gas will be higher than that. It's beneficial to the oil barons in America and the oligarchs in Russia. Now watch a war gets declared and who benefits the most for it. Eric Prince and the like will be dancing in the streets.

9027 2018-05-08 13:18:04 Ending the #IranDeal doesn't "Make America Great Again" in fact it works against the best interests of America and in favor of our seriously problematic "regional allies" in the Middle East and other oil magnates who think they can control everybody's oil indefinitely

9030 2018-05-08 13:17:59 Even worse. They have also decided to punish Venezuela at the same time. Venezuela is the 11th largest producer of oil in the world..
9031 2018-05-08 13:17:50 Trump pulling out of Iran deal is going to raise oil prices, which is going to be an effective tax on the middle class American people. Once again, the middle class gets screwed by Trump.

9043 2018-05-08 13:16:46 100% agree. Conservatives gave considerable tax breaks, oil prices were above 100. a barrel, there was plenty of money for responsible reinvestment. Instead the money got banked  so much for trickle down.

9083 2018-05-08 13:13:06 $WTIC - Iran oil never leaves the market, regardless of policy.  Worst case, Iran oil goes to China, and oil that going to China will come to the US.  The transportation webs might be a little less efficient taking cost up a little, but it's not a total loss of supply.

9104 2018-05-08 13:10:58 Trump you are a total idiot, you fuck up the Iran deal, since you came into office 
The price of Gas and oil has gone up 
You fuck up this deal, oil will go up 
That fucks the People of our country 
They will pay higher price for gas
9105 2018-05-08 13:10:50 Trump shot JR, then stole oil rights, shares rights with Russia, then bought more real estate in Timbuckrio.

9107 2018-05-08 13:10:41 Why do Rs like $100 oil, $4 gas and American recessions so much?
9108 2018-05-08 13:10:37 It is Iran's money it is disturbing in 2018 to have thinkers like you ,just like your pres ,take their oil and their money and land, those days should be past already, repent of your wicked thoughts
9109 2018-05-08 13:10:37 If the price of oil goes up they may have enough money to survive and stretch this missery out for years like Cuba.
9110 2018-05-08 13:10:35 Oil prices were not reduced then and the government should be blamed for any rise as they continue to be “refined” by reliance and other Modi-friends

9118 2018-05-08 13:09:49 It’s terrible that the people who this really impacts rarely have access to Twitter and are not able to properly advocate for themselves.

9120 2018-05-08 13:09:31 They WANT the price up, I think.  They are doing a lot of “supporting” oil and gas, and I think somewhere there is money being invested (or already invested) by high government officials and donors.  That is, in this area, I have become a “conspiracy theorist”...1/2

9124 2018-05-08 13:09:13 1. We have a deal in place that many, including Israeli intel, say the Iranians are complying with.
2. Why trade that for NOTHING?

Won't be surprised you pull out (like your father SHOULD HAVE) and send oil prices up offsetting any tax gains working class saw. Of course, the wealthy will continue to profit simply by shares of stock.

9173 2018-05-08 13:02:56 Why I'm sure Trump will leave the Ian deal: 1) it destabilizes the oil supply 2) raising oil prices, 3) putting money in Putin's pocket 4) where Trump has a closer view of it.
9174 2018-05-08 13:02:53 si, ma oil pubblico non lo ha fatto, e continua a costare da 5 a 6 volte di più: pensa che Musk ci guadagna pure e riesce a stare così basso...

9177 2018-05-08 13:02:45 Interesting that Shoalhaven was built in 1977, during a period of relatively high and uncertain oil prices and then scaled back in the 80s. If oil spikes in the next 24 months, very possible, more pumped hydro schemes will emerge. But they are capital intensive and take time.

9196 2018-05-08 13:01:11 The high oil price is one reason why most Americans feel no benefit from the "yooge" tax cuts. They spend more than the little they got in tax cuts on higher gas (and health costs.)

9217 2018-05-08 12:59:05 I’m so sorry . This happens to me sometimes and it usually only gets worse from there. If you don’t already have a regimen, I find that BC powder, a caffeinated beverage (cokes are common), and peppermint oil and/or white flower oil
9218 2018-05-08 12:59:04 Tourism alone can earn us much more than crude oil if we can open our eyes and celebrate what we have. Nigeria is a beautiful and blessed nation but we’ve been misruled and misguided. May God help us.

9227 2018-05-08 12:58:42 Such High Oil Prices and Prices 
I am Surprised People aren't asking questions to Govt. They are actually Justifying 

They are happy paying so high oil prices. 
Why? In the Name of Modi-God? 
I guess we have a new God Now.

9230 2018-05-08 12:58:37 えー 、すごーい！
9231 2018-05-08 12:58:34 If the President withdraws from the Iran deal today, it will be bad news for most but good news for his oil and gas buddies with gasoline prices soaring! Hmmm.
9232 2018-05-08 12:58:33 I really enjoy them. Was it with coconut oil or actual MCT oil? I find them filling!
9233 2018-05-08 12:58:31 Oil just hit a 4 year high! Currently retail gas prices have gone up about 35 cents per gallon. If you drive 18000 miles per year that is an additional $250 per year in expense if your car gets 20 mpg. For many, that eats up their couple extra bucks from the #faketaxcut. #MAGA
9234 2018-05-08 12:58:30 We all know it is ill advised to back out of #JCPOA. This is a sound deal. Why create more tension in the world. To appease a few core allies at the cost of your major allies? Then the US president complains about oil cost increase?

9237 2018-05-08 12:58:20 It’s all very disturbing and irreversible. What dialogue I would start is Iran is complying with dealby all UN inspections. Trump pulls out of deal. Prices of oil “ie” gasoline go up. Helps all those oil companies supporting him. Hurts us.

9241 2018-05-08 12:58:12 Leaving Iran deal=global instability=spiking oil prices.  Already yesterday oil is up to $70/barrel.  Is this what you call #MAGA?
9242 2018-05-08 12:58:08 Oil prices are the highest in 4 years and will jump higher if you pull us out of the Iran deal! Don't do it! You will be responsible for higher prices at the gas pump if you do! It will slow our economy! Stay with our allies continuing oversight the Iran Nuclear Deal!!
9243 2018-05-08 12:58:04 Joel, The oil companies generates maximum revenue. There is a hidden monitoring income, very confidential.
9244 2018-05-08 12:57:57 Facts: pull oil ( mass) to burn in cars ( energy- mass) then planet is losing mass by shitloads in burned gas, trapped CO2.
As Sun ages it Grows, it will encompass Earth in billion years or so as it gains mass.
Earth loses mass gets pulled closer to the Sun!
9245 2018-05-08 12:57:46 While tinkering with the #IranDeal gas prices are already rising. Pulling out of the deal mean Iran oil goes off the market, means higher gas prices. Higher prices & less oil on the market makes Russian oil more valuable. @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews @samstein @LOLGOP
9246 2018-05-08 12:57:46 Put a lil tea tree oil & they will be gone overnight 
9247 2018-05-08 12:57:43 @realDonaldTrump It stands to reason that Jared's trip to Saudia Arabia was to ensure them that when YOU pull out of the Iranian Deal, they will profit in Oil Prices and clue you in. Drive prices up here for the Koch Brothers...

9261 2018-05-08 12:56:35 US Oil Companies make huge gains as oil prices rise.  We, the people, lose because gas prices rise.
9262 2018-05-08 12:56:28 At least there won’t be gas rationing during the traditional peak summer period. Let’s not forget the 1970s when Americans were held hostage by our oil producing “friends” from the Middle East.

9266 2018-05-08 12:56:09 Because it's a lie.  Note that we produce oil, and we also have our own refineries here in Canada, and could in theory be completely independent of other countries, yet we some how always have much higher gas prices than the US even after adjusting for exchange and metric conv.
9267 2018-05-08 12:55:57 All you need is an oven and 30mn. The "trickiest" part perhaps is that you need a lot of different kinds of stuff to make it tasty, such as cereal flakes (oat), nuts, oil, syrup...
9268 2018-05-08 12:55:49 Maybe you don't, but all the Wolves in the  District of Criminals want the oil and the land for Israels' expansion. Get a job in D.C with the wolves  maybe you could sell them your opinion.??
9269 2018-05-08 12:55:43 The tax reform helped everyone. Corporations are the number one employer in the US. do you like having a job? No corporations mean no jobs for millions. As for the oil prices, How is he in anyway shape or form responsible? That is totally controlled by OPEC and the market
9270 2018-05-08 12:55:43 The price of oil is about to explode and this will allow more offshore drilling ,less restrictions and more catastrophe.

Pruitt and Zinke are about to get rich through oil exploration ...

The threat of US Sanctions on China? lol, you have to admit, that's ridiculous @newday
9278 2018-05-08 12:54:12 @Morning_Joe More oil hysteria. Saudis would increase production just to stick it to Iran.

9281 2018-05-08 12:54:09 I think nothing changes. Maybe oil price relaxes and everthing goes back to normal. Maybe I am wrong but it's very unlikely to see high fluctuation in market
9282 2018-05-08 12:54:04 Oil speculation at it's finest. The real threat to America is the oil traders.
9283 2018-05-08 12:54:04 I suspect you have some insider trader deals going on with oil prices.

9285 2018-05-08 12:53:50 Pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal is about raising Russian oil prices.
9286 2018-05-08 12:53:41 That’s a big if. You’re talking about 160,000,000,000 known barrels of oil reserves. (That doesn’t count the stuff we haven’t found yet.) The market isn’t going anywhere soon, either. Global demand keeps increasing.

Have you noticed that the price of oil has more then doubled since 2014 but the stock prices of the big oil companies do not reflect this. Plus today it was noted that this increase of oil prices  are going to hurt the bottom lines of many companies. Scam

9298 2018-05-08 12:52:35 @GreenoreCG could you confirm oil spill on Lough yesterday & if clean up was required? 
9299 2018-05-08 12:52:28 Actually, the protests have pushed this issue into the front of the public, media and politics in this country.  The fact that "everything is made from oil" is the problem and needs addressing because we have a climate crisis.

9315 2018-05-08 12:51:18 I have to disagree slightly. Despite fighting in Iraq for almost a decade, the USA got no oil out of the conflict. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry at the end of the war

The question os how long USA will be managed by the evil talmudists, who want to overcontrol all the region which is rich In oil? Why American citizens have to pay?
9352 2018-05-08 12:47:27 Thank you @SecretarySonny for your work to defend corn farmers and the RFS against attacks from Big Oil. Farm income is declining. Rural America can’t afford to lose ethanol markets. #RFSworks

9356 2018-05-08 12:46:43 But take heart - The amount of CO2 in the air at Mauna Loa (weekly value) has only increased 0.61 ppmv in the last year, showing that crude oil production and atmospheric CO2 do not correlate with each other.

9358 2018-05-08 12:46:30 So we turn to the God of science? I have lived with PTSD all of my life until I was 50. It was trauma caused by having a mother who was evil. I have dealt with vets who have PTSD caused by war. I can help them to stop it with Extreme oil and Holy oil and I already have.
9359 2018-05-08 12:46:28 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

9378 2018-05-08 12:45:12 The likelihood that President Trump reneges the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions on Iran, plus the collapse of Venezuela’s crude production have pushed the price of oil over $70 per barrel —the highest in three years.

9400 2018-05-08 12:42:34 I expect oil prices to keep rising for a while especially after Trumps announcement today. I expect the USA to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal which was negotiated by Obama and the Europeans. Trump campaigned on that. More meat for his base. Smh

9406 2018-05-08 12:41:54 OMG @ianbremmer I cant believe you said that on #oil and that Americans dont care about #Israel and Obama gave us cheap oil with the #Irandeal. 1stly U.S. producers NEED $65 oil and the Saudi oil war in 2014 HURT us not helped.

@MorningsMaria @dagenmcdowell @Varneyco @potus
9407 2018-05-08 12:41:53 This could spark a trade war unless we carve out Iranian oil consumers from US sanctions which defeats a lot of their purpose right @amoshochstein ?

9436 2018-05-08 12:38:57 Indexing the gas tax to inflation is the fairest way to pay to  fix our roads. Many tourists travel in WI & that ensures they pay fair share. The minimum markup is designed to prevent monopoly oil companies from driving out smaller competitors & jacking up prices even higher.

9458 2018-05-08 12:37:10 As for the oil issue, I think that the trade is not restricted to only oil, there are other EU investments there in other spheres as well. Iran is a big market after all, being a nation of some 80 million people.
9459 2018-05-08 12:36:56 The root of most Islamic terrorism today is cultural rather than religious, and pushed by many forces external to religion, in particular weapons dealers and oil powers.

9483 2018-05-08 12:33:31 Well they are getting several billion $s or more from Cdn taxpayers (the help-a-private-oil-giant fund) so I'm assuming their AGM will be a huge success. #cdnpoli

9486 2018-05-08 12:32:54 All that oil and yet the people have nothing in there stores.   How stupid is that.  They need to eliminate there government and get back to doing right.
9487 2018-05-08 12:32:53 I used to do this but the maintenance and oil costs became prohibitive. Using vaseline is inhumane. I finally just got the small “Squirrel Buster” feeder, solved the problem. #Unsolicited Endorsement

Denuclearization of Korea

Tax cuts
Consumer confidence way up
Biggest exporter of oil
9489 2018-05-08 12:32:35 Absolutely. Our governments response is appalling! Also unsurprising with republicans in office. Texas got the most aid because they have all the oil production. Where I live in central FL there are still apartment complexes and homes with tarps on their roofs from slow aid
9490 2018-05-08 12:32:24 @PutinRF_Eng drop the oil to $20 a barrel and halve the price of gas #Gasprom
9491 2018-05-08 12:32:22 With Trump's announcement on Iran later today, expect some volatility in oil throughout the day. You saw a glimpse of it yesterday, simply off of Trump's tweet about his 2pm announcement today. 

Be careful out there today. $xle
9492 2018-05-08 12:32:20 Terrible el agua. Fui a Oncativo a llevar gas oil pero imposible entrar al campo!!
9493 2018-05-08 12:32:17 I'm against pipelines too. But in general, individuals, businesses, and small companies collectively emit more than oil & gas. We need to do more to reduce *all* sources of GH gasses.

9496 2018-05-08 12:31:08 .@Jim_M_Keating from @NalcorEnergy suggests to the national MPA panel standards that oil&gas activities would be less acceptable in an actual MPA (vs marine refuge). Good news for the Laurentian Channel? @CNLOPB @scotttessier

9518 2018-05-08 12:29:38 $OIL Oil futures retreated from 3.5-year highs this morning ahead of Trump's afternoon announcement on whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran. Concerns about Iranian crude coming off the market pushed prices up on Monday.
9519 2018-05-08 12:29:30 Iran President Hassan Rouhani said in a meeting with oil ministry officials on Tuesday, “Basis of our foreign policy is constructive ties with outside world. Whether or not sanctions are re-imposed, we should stand on our own feet. We should proceed with economic development.”
9520 2018-05-08 12:29:28 Drop oil to $10 a barrel
9521 2018-05-08 12:29:14  Oil prices surrendered gains on worries the United States may be set to pull out of a key nuclear accord with Iran. Futures for Canada’s main stock index were little changed as investors remained on the sidelines as they tracked U.S. President

9529 2018-05-08 12:27:57 In case you haven’t connected the dots: Trump dismantling the Iran Deal is all about increasing the price of Russian oil.

9546 2018-05-08 12:25:35 This is an attempt to put the genie back into the bottle.
The UK Nationalists are desperately trying to undermine any notion that there are legitimate socio-political reasons for an independent Scotland. They want to fight on the "blood & (s)oil" front as that's where they win.

9550 2018-05-08 12:25:18 Kremlin is probably secretly rooting for Trump to scrap Iran deal as Iran has resisted oil production cuts and generally wants to make trouble for Russian customers....
9551 2018-05-08 12:25:15 Why you’re paying more at the gas pump .  So why is Canada not stepping up supplying oil from the Alberta sands to combat shortages. Liberals as usual bumbling along not sure of what to do.  Why not get the trains bring supply from Alberta as it did for the last few years.

9565 2018-05-08 12:23:13 Most likely Iran outcome today seems to be:

Trump kills deal, reimposes oil sanctions. 

BUT

Waits on other sanctions (banking, insurance, shipping...) until renewal is due in July. 

Keeping small window for Europe to get “better deal” by then.

9566 2018-05-08 12:23:07 That seems a bit unfair to me - they're only going to reform Europe in the same way you 'reformed' Iraq, and as for them being unrepresentative, your oil war in Iraq was believed in by no-one but you and our Tony...

9575 2018-05-08 12:21:52 The oil industry is also concerned about electric cars (new tech) which will eventually make them obsolete at least for most things...70 dollars per barrel is usually a good price good for us and the oil industry especially Venezuela who counts on oil as income

9590 2018-05-08 12:20:00 Look former governments have been seeking for destabilization to get low oil prices and that is not what we the people voted for, right? The countries that we destabilized have been destroyed by us and extremists, which were founded also because of our interventions...

9612 2018-05-08 12:17:57 It's supply and demand- oil companies don't set prices, the market does. #gasprices are higher in summer, because like you, many travel in warm months. Demand rises, prices follow.
9613 2018-05-08 12:17:43 Farmers who happily voted for Trump are now frantically tweeting at him not to blow up the ethanol market in favor of oil companies. WHAT DID YOU THINK HE WAS GOING TO DO. 

Sigh. 

Okay, back to planting corn. Most of which will go to the ethanol market. So far.

9618 2018-05-08 12:16:57 Today the good Lord has come again as he does every 2 years to oil the wheels of democracy as we move towards primary elections in 4 states: WV, OH, IN, NC. It’s great to live in a country where a President isn’t sworn into office 4 times to serve over 20 years  #ElectionDay
9619 2018-05-08 12:16:45 Lots of reasons for Trump to stick with Iran deal (low oil prices, no Plan B, risk of military conflict, slap in face to US allies...).

Convincing N Korea to denuclearize, which they’ve no intention of doing, isn’t one of them.
9620 2018-05-08 12:16:43 yes, I contend that both Obama & Trump have to do pretty much what the Military & Oil Industrial Complex tell them to do. That's been my stance for a long time.  JFK was the last President we had.
9621 2018-05-08 12:16:43 And keep in mind - reimposing US sanctions on Iran and it’s central bank ( for no reason ) could spark a trade war. Are we going to let the rest of the world keep buying oil from Iran through the Central Bank or sanction them too?
9622 2018-05-08 12:16:33 @harshal_dj crude oil prices are likely to go up or down?

9626 2018-05-08 12:15:29 Indonesia does not have oil. 
And with those alternative source of energy, oil is not interesting anymore.

Apparently, the right political leaders want to be rich fast and the people want to have 72 virgins. 

So, they are right now so eager to turn the country into khilafah.

9640 2018-05-08 12:14:23 Here is the problem I have with it. Iran has oil. If Iran pursues nukes again which seems likely if we renig on the deal, then that gives US reason again for conflict with active bases surrounding iran in iraq, afghanistan and qatar etc. Oil wars 4.0

9663 2018-05-08 12:10:55 I don't think @senatorials grasps that all our "fuel" (oil, coal, natural gas) was once CO2 in the atmosphere that 400 million years of photosynthesis removed. Which worked out well for us for several thousand years till we figured out how much heat was released when lit on fire
9664 2018-05-08 12:10:54 Hahahaha. What's the name of the oil.
9665 2018-05-08 12:10:51 Just a small historical note. President GW Bush literally ordered the ships carrying heavy oil to N. Korea, as a part of the Clinton arrangement to stop their nuclear projects, to turn around mid-Pacific. NK restarted their nuclear program in 3 months.

9668 2018-05-08 12:10:33 Some of impacts oil yes but also The rebound in oil prices can be attributed to OPEC’s efforts to limit production globally and to a decision by the United States to start exporting its own supply

obviously USA should pay their fair price for oil rather than steal it, but otherwise it should strike a balance between

9767 2018-05-08 11:57:53 One side effect the typical #Trump bot will fail to mention about leaving the Iran Deal is the likelihood that #Iran will cut oil production which will lead to higher oil/gas prices. That would then raise prices on goods transported by truck, and so on and so on.

9776 2018-05-08 11:56:31 Why the F**K are you calling this a record high? 5-10 years ago price of oil per barrel was about $120. Saying it’s hitting $70 is NOT A RECORD HIGH!!!
9777 2018-05-08 11:56:22 It’s as if he’s truly trying to collect flies with vinegar anymore. Like he’s fully giving up even having a shred of decency to sell his snake oil. I’m over it.

9780 2018-05-08 11:55:42 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 1) Oil is up to $70 barrel, Speculators are ready to push it to $90-100 levels, combined w/ no practical solutions w/ Venezuela for lack of talent , in 4-8 weeks we area at $ 4 gallon. Hedge Funds & Oil sheiks celebrating. Iran Crisis will cost $1 Trillions
9781 2018-05-08 11:55:34 it's the rumsfeld era all over again.

9786 2018-05-08 11:55:06 @HayekAndKeynes had a quick question if you can help. Higher crude oil prices mean countries need to buy more dollars to pay for same quantity of oil? Or the movement also has to do with financial flows into 3% yielding Treasury securities...
9787 2018-05-08 11:55:06 I only poke fun because it is a fantastic indicator...that doesn’t work when we’re chugging through oil at a ferocious pace.
9788 2018-05-08 11:54:45 It seems that the US/Iran decision is coming today, so I'm thinking that could be a driver for some assets. USD/CAD in particular seems highly responsive to the news flow on it (probably due to oil)

9798 2018-05-08 11:53:12 My kids used to be on the local swim team so they were in the pool constantly. Warm up a bit of coconut oil (so it's liquid) and use it like lotion (can also use in hair) after shower. It will help with dry, chlorine skin and helps with the smell.

9805 2018-05-08 11:52:11 At 20h00 SA time Pres Trump will announce his decision on whether the US stays in the Iran/Nuclear deal. If it stays you can expect oil prices to drop and we’d pay less for petrol/diesel. If he pulls out we may well get uncomfortably close to R20/liter. #IranDeal
9806 2018-05-08 11:52:10 If the Trump administration scraps the nuclear deal, Iranian hardliners will be emboldened to resume uranium enrichment. Iran needs nuclear power once its vast oil supply is exhausted in several decades.
9807 2018-05-08 11:52:03 I think you should take a trip to Iran this summer. See what is going on there and be sure to criticize the deal in public. Bring back some oil after they stop exporting it. Oh and test those missle defense systems because they will use their new nukes.

9819 2018-05-08 11:51:05 The price of oil, already going up because of the impending sanctions deadline, would rise further, increasing gasoline prices and cancelling out the benefits of the Trump tax cuts for middle and lower-income Americans.
9820 2018-05-08 11:50:51 If Iran, China, Russia, Turkey use gold, those deals cannot happen at the current gold/oil ratio; gold must be revalued higher for those transactions, in effect creating a 2-tier gold mkt.  If USD gold is not allowed to rise, USD should rise while oil and EM currencies fall.

9822 2018-05-08 11:50:46 My take: it will depend i) on external factors ($, oil) ii) market confidence iii) luck (one Turkish blue chip collapse may create panic) iv) govt coming to its senses

9830 2018-05-08 11:50:14 @Morning_Joe folks, you are overthinking it, trump supporters are simpletons like him.  They can only digest tiny bits of info and are very transactional.  They are incapable of seeing long term issues, so they are never going to care about future “oil paintings”!

9851 2018-05-08 11:47:26 Despite the other factors, it still doesn't really make sense that if the record high was $1.42/litre in 2008 when the price of a barrel of oil was $147, why we're now paying $1.30/litre when the price of a barrel of oil is only $70?
9852 2018-05-08 11:47:23 I used the jet wash, worked a treat. Left it over night to dry out in that heat then stuck a fence brush on a pole and applied the oil...piece of cake it was :)

For all his genocidal scummyness, Hitler knew the Royal Navy would starve him of resources.
In 1940 over 90% of the world's oil came from the US and Venezuela.
He got some oil from Romania, but that was insignificant.
What remained was in the USSR
