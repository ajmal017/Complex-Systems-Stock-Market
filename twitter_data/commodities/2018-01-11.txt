28 2018-01-11 22:20:17 One of the sources of human trafficking is that human beings lose their essential value and become commodities for other purposes, one of such which ISIS excels in is the selling of anything for the purchase of weaponary to continue shedding blood of innocents for power expansion
29 2018-01-11 22:12:03 Fair question! Presumably I'd end up overweight in oil, commodities and FANGS. Mainly though it wouldn't be much fun! Do agree that Buffett probably has it right on trackers.

32 2018-01-11 22:01:11 They rely on US military hegemony to secure (and enforce) access to markets to export commodities and capital. I don't mean to make it sound like the evil US is oppressing noble Norwegian capitalists though it would be fairer to say the US both enables them and holds them hostage

38 2018-01-11 21:26:03 Mr Trudeau: as a former executive, now retired, you need to have something (US) wants and we have it. Water and Natural gas. Tell the US if they scrub NAFTA we will charge a 50% premium for both of these commodities and also all US defense contractors will be penalized 35%.
39 2018-01-11 21:25:10 Why not give subsidies to all businesses for insurance and commodities? Big Ag is way, way, way out of line. It is all corn and beans and we have mountains of corn that cannot be sold. After the blue wave, you'll see fairness and the land will thank us.

45 2018-01-11 21:11:45 I mean, banks invest most of it, right? Into companies, commodities and such. But companies don't keep cash on hand, they keep it in banks! There has to be a printed dollar for every electronic dollar out there, but so much of commerce is digital.

50 2018-01-11 20:32:55 A federal sales tax (instead of income tax) would be the fairest way to handle tax bracket. Exempt necessary commodities like food and medicines, moderate taxes on "nice to have" things, and heavy taxes on things like super expensive cars, mansions, and private jets.

54 2018-01-11 20:24:30 If my memory serves me right, the basic commodities (16) were placed under PRICING & availability monitoring to normalise macro-economic indicators.

55 2018-01-11 20:24:12 I would say deval. is necessary & LT bullish, but the adjustment will create a bear market. 42-51 was the end of WW2, & the Marshal Plan, very different. China gets it with OBOR. I am bullish non-industrial commodities, that’s about it.  I pray you are correct, & i am wrong.

57 2018-01-11 20:14:16 En 2001 sectores agropecuarios en crisis se movilizaron. Se gritaba "Rentabilidad o muerte". Precios bajos y alto endeudamiento. La hectárea valía 300 dólares. Vino la devaluación, subieron los precios de commodities y la hectárea pasó a valer entre 3 y 8 mil dólares.
58 2018-01-11 20:09:09 If I feel so much pain over th price of body lotion (Nivea) that I buy once evry 2/3 mnths. Hw should I react towards th basic commodities that I need & buy almost everyday.

59 2018-01-11 20:07:28 Ever consider that reason why USD weakened was that China produced a mother load of stimulus in 2016, which aided recovery across commodities, EM, Europe & that ECB was going to taper +Euro was cheap. +rally in the Dollar late 2016, was an overbuying of Trump trade and tax plans?
60 2018-01-11 19:56:25 Bruh, you would be surprised how ignorant  most people are to this nation's dark history. In most cases it is either diminished or completely removed. Hopefully this movie can use well known commodities (Mrs. Henson) to motivate a new generation.
61 2018-01-11 19:54:19 Ummm military intervention in price control. Im afraid it will not worsen the situation by causing scarcity of the basic commodities
62 2018-01-11 19:48:57 @DaveHcontrarian WTI oil continuing to creep up, now $64. Any changes to your view that top is right around here? I tend to agree with your call though wonder whether this typical late-cycle commodities blow-off might extend more due to hot money chasing it (like early 2008).
63 2018-01-11 19:46:51 makes sense- collectibles perhaps have better perception gravity & chances + confiscation/ban safety I guess, perhaps commodities that serve human needs would work better (although they decay, except things like Cigar Liquor, Dry fruits/seeds etc).. always love picking ur brains.
64 2018-01-11 19:40:12  Gaming desk or super desk? I’m not saying you gotta put your PC inside of it (although that’d be sweet), but it’d be designed w/specific commodities for R Blades/PCs, R Chroma Hardware, LED placements, headset, etc. Varients similar to BW X? I just had trouble choosing a desk.

82 2018-01-11 18:38:54 The problem Starts from the source. Warehouses owners and farmers monopolized the commodities, raw mats of all kinda including flour, they're afraid of sudden rise of dollar price and some are too greedy so they sewed up the food raw mats to sell 'em in ridiculously high price

93 2018-01-11 17:50:57 I hear @PRESIDENT_ED has tasked Coupwenga  to lead an ad-hoc committee to deal with wanton price increases of basic commodities. Does he think that such can be dealt with by deploying tanks? Its a different scenario this time arround.
94 2018-01-11 17:49:46 Makes sense #commodities are going to be the trade of 2018. Surprised it’s not increasing even more...
95 2018-01-11 17:48:27 Can I call them virtual commodities (or even cryptocommodity) until it matures greatly or becomes ubiquitous as a trade unit for many things big and small? 

That said, volatile goods are fun to trade because of risk and reward

They wouldn't--so there has to be something else going on.  We have 3 proven commodities in Russ, PG and Melo--and one unproven in coach.
102 2018-01-11 17:28:35 Nice piece....there are certainly some important divergences forming underneath this momentum rally....utilities pricing in much higher rates, not a good sign for the overall mkt with the recent move in the 10yt, and commodities across the board starting to come off multi yr bttm

125 2018-01-11 16:36:37 Given the 3 combined asset classes implied within #Bitcoin (FX, commodities, private equity), its price action should be more volatile.  However, there is no doubt that #volatility being sucked out of the system have forced some vol seeking investors into this asset class.

135 2018-01-11 16:11:28 Other currencies, metals, commodities (remember oil and grains in 2007?) If you remember, Trump actually said he will be doing this. He thinks this is the way to boost economy. He doesn't get currency plays are zero-sum minus opportunity cost and friction.
136 2018-01-11 16:10:23 This is one thing of many I just can’t stand when socialists/communists talk economics and policy, they talk about declaring things like housing, healthcare, and other commodities as rights without understanding the ramifications of doing such a thing...
137 2018-01-11 16:07:16 This is very useful information to track. I have a working hypothesis that btc will regress in price to its marginal cost to obtain at some point  and that will be the buy point after a bear market. This is also true for most mined commodities.

177 2018-01-11 14:07:23 Alternatively the commodities of a specific region or clime might be seen as providential compensations for its particular shortcomings/"incommodities". (which might not be an argument for trade, per se, though a justification of exploration and colonization).

192 2018-01-11 13:18:28 just so odd, the brexit argument - in so far as it exists at all - is we can move our exports up value chain and import commodities cheaper on world markets. Now where exactly does PG Tips fit into that?

258 2018-01-11 08:32:38 If it’s measured by weight I’d suggest more likely to be either of the other 2 commodities suggested in @OED: inferior sort of cloth or sugar refined from first dripping through.
259 2018-01-11 08:31:57 In 2016, despite a P14 inc in diesel oil prices from P18.25 to P32.10, inflation still remained low and stable. Prices of food, transportation, electricity, gas, housing, and water inc only by 2% to 3%. Basic commodities did not inc in prices despite the 75% inc in diesel price.
260 2018-01-11 08:26:58 And do you really think all products have been kept at the same rates as existing prior to GST?? You're living in an imaginary world. Govt has taken a policy call, and reduced prices of a lot of essential commodities, rates on which were higher in the old regime.
261 2018-01-11 08:05:54 I said this at an event in 2000, i.e whilst the value of our investments in property, commodities, stocks etc may go up or down; any investment in a fellow human can never go down - even if they choose not to use the skills, knowledge etc invested.
