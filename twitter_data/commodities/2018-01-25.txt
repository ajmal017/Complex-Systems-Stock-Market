35 2018-01-25 22:59:56 Q pasó en el 2do gob de La Señora de Kirchner? Commodities baratos q no alcanzan para pagar el enorme gasto público creado por ellos mismos. Q hacemos? Imprimir papeles, cepo y ocultar la inflación. No podés gastar más de lo que ganás, me imagino que vos no lo hacés en tu casa.
36 2018-01-25 22:47:51 The CRB Index has made a big move (+8.5%) since mid Dec due to weaker US$...could see some profit taking in commodities in the short-term but we expect it to move higher over next 3-5 years.

44 2018-01-25 22:22:58 What do you mean by crypto is “traded like commodities” vs. fiat? We trade in currency pairs, but the volatility is much higher because everyone is figuring out where value is really being created by this new tech.
45 2018-01-25 22:20:08 Dollar needs to stay on the low end of range, for stocks, commodities and real estate to keep rallying. As long as it is at the low end of present range, daily fluctuations don’t mean much Tyler.

57 2018-01-25 21:45:05 I'd even argue that crypto isn't being traded like most commodities because most commodity futures are also traded by producers and users for hedging purposes and have value driven by production and usage. Right now crypto is being driven purely by speculation.

Outro dado importante: Governo Lula começou com contas em dia e dinheiro em caixa via empréstimo do FMI(o terceiro desde o Plano Real), isto somado ao grande fluxo das commodities permitiram o gov. gastar em demasia
66 2018-01-25 21:03:34 Porque houve mudança no cenário externo com queda do preço dos commodities, por exemplo. Além disso, houve erros na condução da economia. Mas os governos petistas têm muitas realizações.
67 2018-01-25 21:01:04 You don't know anything special troll. This week's rise was purely on the whole dollar fiasco. ALL commodities are following the DXY right now. The rise had nothing to do with oil fundamentals and you know it. You're a fraud whose time is running out.

104 2018-01-25 19:19:25 Back to my tortured analogy of farming: a society with markets and a medium of exchange can commodities food. many people never need to think about farming again. Different from one that merely has developed efficient  ploughs, but everyone still farms their food.
105 2018-01-25 19:17:34 Is that why Oil and all the commodities we use daily keep going up in price as it relates to the Dollar? Am I missing something? Somebody better tell China and Russia.

110 2018-01-25 19:05:59 Acredito que existe espaço para os dois tipos de cultivo, o Brasil é um dos países que mais exporta commodities sendo assim não fossem os agrotóxicos isso não seria possível. Por outro lado, o cultivo orgânico possibilita um consumo mais saudável com toda a certeza...
111 2018-01-25 19:05:42 Empecé diciendo de acuerdo. De hecho, nosotros hacemos un índice e informe enfocado en TCRM hace años (desde 1998), antes que el BCRA lo hiciera. Segundo, una cosa no quita la otra. La mayoría de los precios internacionales de nuestros commodities están denominados en USD.
112 2018-01-25 19:01:29 Pero commodities en USD está influido por USD vs terceros. Ergo si hay que elegir algo siempre es mejor multilateral. No importa tanto cuál sea la moneda en que cotice el commodity sino cómo se comporta.

143 2018-01-25 17:01:39 This rally has largely been about a shift of money flow into commodities, supported by a breaking dollar amid a strengthening global economy. Commodity supplies may be turning the corner, but this isn't a panic-driven Midwest drought rally. #OATT

191 2018-01-25 14:58:10 Stability is important for any country looking for a currency...and I don't see any evidence that any cryptocurrency can be described as stable. Wild increases OR decreases in value are EXTREMELY bad things for currency. Stocks and commodities traders like that behavior.
192 2018-01-25 14:56:01 Actually, it’s not debatable, it’s fact.  ..a week before the referendum the £ traded at $1.4064
A week after it was $1.3429
The average for June 2016 was $1.4209
Since pretty much all commodities are traded in $, it’s important. 
The current rate is $1.4295
193 2018-01-25 14:54:34 What if you are worried commodities create inflation central banks overreact to?
194 2018-01-25 14:51:31 Draghi's final reply was to the question on the pricing of commodities in dollar. Was this not an opportunity for him to say something about euro Freegold? No, Draghi implicitly agreed with the journo that gold is still being priced in dollar. What a waste of energy.

200 2018-01-25 14:33:54 Going back a little further than 10 years catches the 2002-07 bear market and pessimism did not work well at all as a contrary indicator. Bear mkts in commodities/currencies tend to act differently than those in stocks/bonds.

205 2018-01-25 14:29:25 - Labourers need to be paid or they die, so from the money made from selling the commodities, the owners pay them as little as they can. Minimise expenses while maintaining productivity and all that
- What's left over is the "profit" made, which the owners keep
206 2018-01-25 14:29:17 It is very clear that BJP failed to provide employment to youngsters ,poverty alleviation, control rising price of essential commodities, farmers apathy, provide facilities to senior citizens, backtrack small traders, petrol- diesal prices as promised
207 2018-01-25 14:26:17 That's not what surplus value is. This is what it is:

- capital needs labour to produce commodities
- labourers do labour for those who own the capital, producing commodities, commodities are sold at whatever price it goes for, obviously aiming to render the business profitable

241 2018-01-25 13:11:45 I think these tax cuts definitely spur inflation in commodities like oil, and food. I think they leader to faster growth in the next 18 months but it’s filling forward growth from the 24 - 36 month period. I don’t see much impact to wages, but temporary windfalls from bonuses
242 2018-01-25 13:09:26 IMO Because athletes are conditioned to believe they are disposable commodities and treated as such by those who wield power over them.  And this seems to be across the board - from Olympic athletes to the student athlete model, to the pros.
243 2018-01-25 13:04:38 Agree on the Trump move. It basically shut us out a huge part of the worlds economy (estimated at 40%). China may not be a member yet, but it is the defacto largest economy, so the TPP members will sell most of their commodities to China. Large growing population and proximity

Please donate to him as he has to take care of his mother sister brother in-law and their children.poor people of poor India.
251 2018-01-25 12:22:45 At the moment #schools and #families rely on outdated way to discover the lates #innovations for #schools. Come to #WonderHub.. Time and Cost are precious commodities. We are at the bett futures corner -stand P38 @Bett_show #Bett2018
252 2018-01-25 12:22:33 Can't predict one year out in commodities. Sense is it would continue on high till Q1 2019. But beyond that if earnings peaked in next quarters I would sell major portion and keep small.
253 2018-01-25 12:19:09 Human beings are not commodities that can be put into a box and neatly packaged.  We are messy and complex and so very interesting.
254 2018-01-25 12:17:57 access is by air. In this event the shipment of perishable commodities is dependant on space available on the aircraft. The subsequent...
255 2018-01-25 12:16:32 Not to worry. Bloxo/HSBC recon its all sweet... we're surfing post GFC wave. The Economist just upped its China/ commodities protection. Let the games ... continue!
256 2018-01-25 12:13:26 Early commodities cycle signs 

1. Max Inventories stat
2. Commodity Price
3. P/E ration don't mistake low P/E for cheap, it could mean peak earning. At best flat P/E over 5, 10 years
4. Supply side constrains, Mine closures, environmental concerns, strike
257 2018-01-25 12:09:09 The jump from 'should diversify' (yes!) to '..through benefaction of commodities' (really?!) often seems based on belief in hidden/easy margins in value chains. Basis of internationally competitive jewellery or confectionary biz not based on where raw material is @stephen_yeboah
258 2018-01-25 12:02:04 Prices of commodities going up rising slowly & swiftly with 10, 20 and 30 shillings. in short its costing you more to buy less. Be vigilant 
259 2018-01-25 11:58:53 Looking at my own trades: it's kind of funny but if everybody talks about stocks easiest trades are done in commodities and currencies.
260 2018-01-25 11:56:38 In growth companies, the pe usually get bigger and reach absurd dimensions but in cyclic/commodities the P/E ratio gets smaller near the end.

Watch out for that change in P/E in #commodities
261 2018-01-25 11:53:22 I feel like HODL 10 is the right direction. But I think right now HODL 10 is like having stocks, bonds and commodities in the same benchmark. I think splitting up by category (/industry/problem) would make sense. But the lines seem very blurry right now.
262 2018-01-25 11:46:04 Thank You for letting us know.We were unaware.Oh yea is Bitcoin all speculation that needs to be tied to commodities?You have never mentioned that either.
263 2018-01-25 11:44:13 $USDX is having incomplete swings sequences in the cycle from the January peak. With bearish Dollar commodities and commodity pairs should stay supported.  #USDX #GOLD #SILVER #OIL #tradingsignals
264 2018-01-25 11:42:43 from my viewpoint we are at the cusp of a big move down in stocks and commodities and up in the dollar. Not seeing much in rates
265 2018-01-25 11:41:17 So basically, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren't backed by physical commodities, so they use a blockchain is a method of verifying transactions with math. It's something like a set of equations that are hard to solve, but have easily verifiable answers, which creates scarcity.
266 2018-01-25 11:38:54 The #PresidentsClub scandal raises wider questions about how women are exploited & abused under capitalism where they are marginalised economically, politically & socially and men are socialised to see women & girls as commodities for their consumption.
267 2018-01-25 11:37:41 Without figure we knew. Prices of all commodities Skyrocketed even d dollar became doubled almost hitting #500 to a $. Dey only use statistic to deceive us in Nigeria. Nigeria had the best economy in Africa it showed on paper.. things re worst than it used to be
268 2018-01-25 11:33:28 Lula surfou no primeiro mandato com a explosão das commodities, perdeu a grande chance de estruturar o Brasil. Em vez disso, deu crédito pra todo mundo e começou o projeto corrupto de poder do PT no Mensalão. Nem era pra ter chegado no segundo mandato.
269 2018-01-25 11:22:40 Weaker dollar usualllly implies, impart, a greater supply of money, at least the expectation of that in the future. Money gotta go somewhere and less and less on the sidelines and I don’t think it is being dumped into bonds or commodities. $SPY $QQQ $DIA $IBB $VIX
270 2018-01-25 11:19:36 Greneral crowd behaviours = guessing markets
Demand = more commodities 
Company racing to discover and produce = no change in visions
271 2018-01-25 11:18:08 The present value of an equity is derived from a discounted value of its future cash flows... its discounted dividend value, a multiple of earnings..   You cant compare a stock valuation based on future earnings to writen down cost of asset values to commodities.
272 2018-01-25 11:16:18 Yes . It’s part of mine. The inflation will keep on increasing till there is stable government and stable economic policies.The country is going through lot of commodities shortage with no food or medicines or essentials. It’s sad to see such things .
273 2018-01-25 11:12:16 El Brazil de Lula se benefició del precio de ciertos commodities (no solo petróleo), y de crear una plataforma de emprendimiento a través de prog como Bolsa Familia.
274 2018-01-25 11:06:27 What I think is that humans creating ANYTHING that resembles humans to be used as commodities is a very bad direction to go because it tricks our own brains into bad or dysfunctional behavior. Point blank.
275 2018-01-25 11:06:05 It seems a weaker dollar is good for America but bad for the world. It is responsible for much of the rise in oil and other commodities. It makes US goods cheaper and devalues our debt. That means debt holders, especially forgiegners, lose wealth.
276 2018-01-25 11:04:57 oh yeah... @MBuhari met naira at 180/$ and drove it up to 360/$ today.
Convert the reserves and tell us the difference too. 
Do we also talk about the purchasing power for ordinary commodities?
277 2018-01-25 11:03:57 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
278 2018-01-25 11:03:53 Could be a very nice turn around story. A weak dollar (new US trade policy?) means hard assets; commodities such as Gold / Copper / Cobalt are priced higher. #ABM also has the Ferensola Gold project: 21m of 3.65g/t (avg) intersected with hot spots upto 15.9g/t in recent drilling
279 2018-01-25 11:00:28 TBH, I had hope in CC as a currency up to the point that the community started to measure its success in terms of dollars/CC or "Market Capitalization".

Those are commodities/investments ratings.

A currency must be stable first and foremost. Too high/Too low/Volatility is bad.
280 2018-01-25 10:58:30 @MamataOfficial Respectable Ma'am, as a commoner , I find NO control / blind eye of the STATE GOVERNMENT, ADMINISTRATION, towards the dishonest traders on their deliberate price rise of season vegetables, green chillies, other commodities as COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. @CPKolkata

284 2018-01-25 10:44:40 You have to also consider how it affects the rest of society - especially women. Prostitution industry treats women as commodities. Just look at all their ads in Germany and elsewhere where it's legal. Is it safe to live in an environment where your body is treated as a product?
285 2018-01-25 10:43:21 It's whether you've been paying attention, I think. But auctioning a character name for a children's book at and event where women are commodities is pretty inappropriate.
286 2018-01-25 10:42:12 ...and that implication that people are merely commodities tells you all you need to know on the matter.
287 2018-01-25 10:32:12 I have only studies=d COCUD and US Cotton. US Cotton Still lot of work is left . Will be working on US Cotton study this weekend. Baaki commodities no idea. But Most of them work on simple rules. Trend is your friend . Foundation for me is support and resistance areas.
288 2018-01-25 10:30:28 Yes when did I say he didn't?! Even though Cinema is non-essential commodity Government unnecessarily fixes Max Ticket Price like it does for Essential Commodity .. so then GST of 28% cannot be  fixed for it like they do it for luxurious commodities.. got the point?!

298 2018-01-25 09:41:51 What is popular is not the same as what is right.  I actually respect the people, farmers included.  For me it's not about respecting people, it's about challenging inherited beliefs and respecting the rights of animals to not be used as commodities.  It's about animals, not you.
299 2018-01-25 09:36:20 #PresidentsClub what's wrong with it? As well as treating women as sexual commodities it's yet another example of women being excluded from a network that shares business, jobs and contracts. Glass ceiling in action.

364 2018-01-25 04:20:45 Agree Doug - once Trade agreements move beyond commodities to movement of labour and dispute settlement - we lose.
365 2018-01-25 04:20:31 Guess all those people thought girls didn’t matter. Just commodities. #timesup
366 2018-01-25 04:17:40 Crude is on Fire. Traded currently at $66.26. Back to this rate almost after 3 years. Technically bullish & aiming $70+..But question is weather it will sustain at higher levels ??? US will try to ramp up production #crudeoil #crude #Commodities #Diesel #Petrol #mcx
367 2018-01-25 04:17:36 US dollar index at fresh 3 and half years lows........
positive for emerging markets and commodities..
fund flows to continue from DMs to EMs.....
thought it is wise to lock profits as EUPHORIA may end soon.

369 2018-01-25 04:02:59 Soft white wheat production has been on the decline in the Palouse for years now, there’s been little to no market with high dockage. Growers are switch commodities that attract better buyers. The American farmer will be just fine.
370 2018-01-25 03:51:32 i agree as well ... with the continued weaken of the USD inflation will start to creep up and that is good for commodities.
371 2018-01-25 03:40:17 Y nos ganó por goleada.. hasta Perú creció y redujo la pobreza. En cambio nosotros, con precios de commodities por las nubes.. logramas reducir el pbi.. que lindo el estado presente.
372 2018-01-25 03:33:32 Of course a weak dollar drives up imports & commodities prices, like Crude Oil, Precious & Base Metals. Makes exports cheaper.
373 2018-01-25 03:31:54 The nature of these countries mostly very low or minimal human resources for health, lack of constant power supply and inadequate health care financing.
These two commodities has good tolerance to our tropical environment.

376 2018-01-25 03:09:29 You may also be interested to know that imported commodities are rocketing in price. OH is joiner- birch ply sheets were c£300 in December now c£400 for same quantity.
377 2018-01-25 03:07:09 The trouble is people will starve before they will default on rent. Sure the market if left will set the price but unlike commodities people will not just give up their shelter. By the time tenants become homeless the problem Is too big to fix.
378 2018-01-25 03:00:36 I dont think someone in his right senses can actually wake up one day and cease to use the commodities hes been using for the rest of their life simply because someone somewhere guided by foreskin said boycott..
379 2018-01-25 02:46:28 Obnoxious...women treated as commodities in 2018...that too in a so-called developed nation

381 2018-01-25 02:41:29 Trade policy 072 prioritise 26 commodities as export potential commodities. #Agrifact
382 2018-01-25 02:34:08 In modern  #democracy money from #taxes work #contracts #production #sales of commodities  all are handed over to companies.
383 2018-01-25 02:33:10 Lol omg. I could be wrong but I believe this will be a great year for commodities barring a black swan. If this is what CBA thinks, no wonder they have a $500 Bill mortgage book filled with IO loans, rising bond yields and they think everything is fine.
384 2018-01-25 02:26:15 If you think a out  shorting 
commodities, check direction of the dollar first.
385 2018-01-25 02:24:27 Never listen to a President from either side taking credit for price reductions.
It's purely controlled by the commodities market.
386 2018-01-25 02:24:24 Very nice!!! Time and money...the most precious commodities....and it’s totally worth it!!!
387 2018-01-25 02:22:58 I believe our criminals have some of the most brilliant minds. But guess what? They weren’t challenged enough and opportunities are still very scarce commodities for some.
388 2018-01-25 02:16:45 Couldn’t you say the same about a number of commodities? #Gold was $2300 in 1980 ($7000) inflation adjusted. Now about half that. Now that is a REAL loss
389 2018-01-25 02:16:43 Exactly. They are commodities. It's only the benevolence of the electorate that provides food stamps. Speech and religion are rights because I can exorcist them without imposing a financial burden on other.
390 2018-01-25 02:14:47 Negativo. A farra de crédito na praça começou no governo dele, a diferença é que ele surfou na onda das commodities.

O crédito artificial na praça viciou o mercado criando bolhas e distorções em tudo que é lado.

É só pesquisar quantos bi de crédito podre a caixa já vendeu
391 2018-01-25 02:09:58 I mperial Ambitions and the two commodities whose identity of quality is amazing.
392 2018-01-25 02:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
393 2018-01-25 02:03:59 BITRACE INVESTMENTS LTD has gained to finalize a deal with BDSwiss Holding PLC, to allow its investors (BITRACE Buyers) to Trade Shares, Indices, FOREX, Commodities and Cryptocurrencies with CFDs, using BITRACE Tokens. #BITRACE

395 2018-01-25 01:54:10 *me meeting another person in finance* Hey wow! You're pretty cool. Let's talk
*me finding out they're in equities not commodities* Oh yeah, I guess that counts too. I mean, not everyone can make the varsity team, right?
396 2018-01-25 01:50:53 Services include delivery of

services. At the end of 2000,
397 2018-01-25 01:50:14 Enron purchases, markets and delivers natural gas,
electricity and other commodities in North America.
398 2018-01-25 01:48:06 You mean labor/wages are subject to the rules of supply and demand (you have to bid more for an item that is in demand) as other commodities? Do they teach this in Biz Schools? They should.
399 2018-01-25 01:46:55 Greenback plummet pushed mainland commodities higher, higher & higher.
SHFE Nickel +5% last night, DCE Coke/Coking Coal are catching up today...
400 2018-01-25 01:46:46 Enron's wholesale business ("Wholesale Services")
includes its worldwide wholesale energy and other
commodities businesses.
401 2018-01-25 01:44:26 End the Fed?  And, replace it with what?  We use currency as a bartering tool.  How much increase? What would that be tied to?  The standard of living? The average home income? The price of commodities?  Given some consideration, perhaps, that will aid in one's case.
402 2018-01-25 01:42:02 Ele ou o contexto economico? Boom das commodities, crescimento da China e etc. Havia um contexto bem diferente do atual e o 1 mandato dele seguiu a cartilha bem tradicional com Palocci na Fazenda e Meirelles, esse ai, no BC
403 2018-01-25 01:40:40 Crude oil prices hit new 3 year high #WTI at $64, #Brent at $70. US weekly inventories decline for 10th week to 411.6 mln Speculative longs at record highs in #crudeoil #crude #Commodities #Diesel #PetrolPrice #Petrol #energy
404 2018-01-25 01:31:50 Não percebes a ponta de um corno de commodities, nem como o preço do petróleo é determinante, está-se a ver.
405 2018-01-25 01:21:53 Las ideas por ahí no se, pero se supo aprovechar los mejores precios de los commodities de la historia!!
406 2018-01-25 01:19:37 Jack Wilshere says commodities prices hurt, needs to be 'far fitter'
407 2018-01-25 01:17:34 Mas se deixa de comprar, lucra bilhões. E o preço do barril de petróleo influi nos preços de praticamente todas as commodities. Para de falar besteira, Cauê!!
408 2018-01-25 01:14:12 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
409 2018-01-25 01:06:48 I wonder what will happen after this term or if this will end. Grabe ang mahal na ng gasolina. In our area umabot kami ng 30 pesos/L dati ngayon it is nearing 50/L. We know naman na pagtumaas gasolina, tataas na ang price ng commodities.
410 2018-01-25 00:59:21 Well,I grew up on and off food stamps(they were called commodities back then)in a poor rural area.Still taught morals,got into college cause of act score and borrowed all the money(50k+)at that time for my education. Just paid it off I'm 41.making excuses for people doesn't help.
411 2018-01-25 00:53:50 The dollar keeps getting slammed and interest rates keep spiking. Bonds looking weaker as the debt looks less desirable with a weaker dollar to foreign countries. Rising interest rates are allowing the financials and even commodities to rally.

418 2018-01-25 00:41:48 El único que ha avanzado de manera sostenida es Chile y Costa Rica, los demás, incluyendo a Perú, han crecido por coyunturas y commodities, minerales, hidrocarburos.
Los países con más libertades comerciales son los que más han crecido.
419 2018-01-25 00:27:51 No subestimemos la manito de los commodities.
420 2018-01-25 00:27:34 @lbc capitalism works from exploiting earth's commodities and human labour 2 make stuff, producing pollution and poverty as by products

422 2018-01-25 00:07:28 Commodities? When I've met strangers at parties or whatever, almost invariably, the first question is, what do you do for a living? And where do you work?
