1 2018-03-14 23:58:19 Whether you agree or disagree with the NRA, it's blantanlty obvious how much money, power, & influence they actually have when after just one lunch date, banning bump stocks & raising purchase age to 21 were both immediately pulled off of the table.
2 2018-03-14 23:57:50 I’m sorry but if guns were controlled we wouldn’t have 20+ school shootings this year alone. And bump stocks (which make semi automatic guns completely automatic) are still leagal. So as you can see guns are not “controlled”.

12 2018-03-14 23:50:44 To paraphrase you - you are all afraid of the NRA. While these steps are positive when are you going to urge them to pass a ban on the AR-15, bump stocks, and make it as hard to buy a gun as it is to get a drivers license? How many more people have to die for you to stand up?

14 2018-03-14 23:49:29 Too bad this STOP Act doesn’t have any concrete measures in it. Does nothing to ban assault weapons or increase the purchasing age to 21 or ban bump stocks. Basically a piece of crap.

37 2018-03-14 23:47:28 The NRA is suing the state of Florida over its minor and reasonable response to Lakeland. Raising the age to purchase firearms to 21 and banning bump-fire stocks. The problem isn't NRA members, it's the NRA itself.
38 2018-03-14 23:46:43 How about enforcing existing laws, prosecuting the criminals and leaving law abiding citizens alone? Why take bump stocks and AR-15’s away from good people? #bumpstocks #AK47 #NRA #libertyforall

44 2018-03-14 23:41:52 Oh cool. Did the house pass the necessary + highly popular ban on distribution/sale of assault/automatic weapons?  That would be a great step forward.  Of course if the focus is simply to arm teachers and ban bump stocks, nothing will actually be accomplished, as you know.

47 2018-03-14 23:40:22 This bill won't do much to help. All that will help is banning semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.

49 2018-03-14 23:39:58 Step one. Now, how about age limits, assault rifles and bump stocks? There is more to be done.

51 2018-03-14 23:39:16 Gov not an advocate for bump stocks but u do understand that they do not turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic rifle if they did that rifle would already be illegal. If u want an open discussion please learn about guns or invite those of us who do to the conversation

57 2018-03-14 23:38:32 Robert this comes right out of your link, "Banning bump stocks and raising the age of purchase for assault rifles from 18 to 21 are good ideas, and may lead to a decrease in overall gun violence." I think those are great ideas. Let's do that.
58 2018-03-14 23:38:09 It's not the strongest law, but it's a start. 

I have no problem with prohibiting the sale of semi automatic and bump stocks. 

How would you remove those guns that are on the streets now?

Ban on assault weapons and bump stocks
Universal background checks
Age 21 to buy assault weapons
Barring dangerous individuals from having guns

87 2018-03-14 23:27:27 We need an assault weapon ban to start with. Bump stocks, silencers, large magazines need to go. Rifles and handguns should be locked in gun cabinets if underaged kids unattended. Stiff punishment to gun owner if kids get caught with a gun unsupervised.
88 2018-03-14 23:27:25 He is a real douche bag.  November 6,2018 should be his last day of employment.  Make America Safe Again.  Ban semi-automatic weapons, extended magazines, bump stocks, raise age limit to 21. Extensive background checks for new and existing gun owners. Annul license and insurance
89 2018-03-14 23:27:07 The 2nd is NOT about hunting.  Private citizens can and DO own automatic weapons.   "Bump stocks" are little more than toys and aren't even needed to bump fire a weapon.  Virtually all firearms  transactions involve background checks.  Stop regurgitating the lies told to you.
90 2018-03-14 23:26:58 Amazing, with all the blood on the hands of the NRA through advocacy of bump stocks, semi-auto guns, high capacity clips, etc etc...AND THEY SEEM DAMN PROUD OF IT! Blood of innocent people, of children, babies :-(   SICK FUCKERS, no 'nice' way to say it !!!
91 2018-03-14 23:26:38 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… their purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible, as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen the deaths already…
92 2018-03-14 23:26:14 1) If the 2nd is no longer required, repeal it.
2) What kinds of weapons are militias supposed to use to fight modern armies?
3) Bump stocks are a joke. They make the gun shoot fast, but extremely inaccurately. In the case of Vegas, I believe that bumpstock saved lives.
93 2018-03-14 23:25:23 This was a sham.  We want #CommonSenseGunReform now.  
We want bump stocks, AR-15 and armour piercing bullets banned, now.
94 2018-03-14 23:24:20 Maybe if they hadn’t given an overwhelming majority of the money to themselves, their patrons & wealthy foreigners who own US stocks, it would’ve had more effect.

96 2018-03-14 23:22:09 1) It does happen all the time. Sellers have little incentive to follow the law. 
2) We agree about bump stocks. Ban them. Your reply is a non sequitor. 
3) An AR is a weapon of war that has nothing to do with hunting and everything to do with the small penis of the owner.

98 2018-03-14 23:21:44 Not only DOES the #NRA/#GOP make it easy for even the mentally ill to purchase semi-automatic weapons, large magazines for more ammo and bump stocks that increase their fire rate, the #NRA feeds them fear and hate dogma, inciting violence, working AGAINST #GunControl.
99 2018-03-14 23:21:27 @DLoesch can you be the NRA CEO please!! Lapierre always gave an inch to these lefties and now bump stocks are being banned, we must never give them an inch

101 2018-03-14 23:19:46 Some charge more for less. I look at amount of hours spent, and quality. Hand drawing obviously takes more hours than putting stocks together with a border around or color over it with lower opacity, and putting text over it. So it should cost more

103 2018-03-14 23:18:45 Honestly no one needs a military style weapon but that's about all I agree with, changing the age accomplishes nothing, ban bump stocks only thing that causes is a lot of charges people will get because you would have to ban 3D printers for that matter. See where this goes.
104 2018-03-14 23:18:44 Great great plan  I agree a tragedy like this should not be allowed to happen again but you putting guns and extra law enforcement which will increase taxes on the lower and middle class well you and all your rich buddies keep your money invested into gun stocks and just

107 2018-03-14 23:17:37 We release the sample pack stocks in smaller sequential batches just so we can keep an eye on the inventory. Otherwise we get rushes of orders and could miscount.
108 2018-03-14 23:16:56 Perfect timing! The space continues to grow for decentralized technology to expand.. Sooner than later both facebook and Google will be replaced. Thank you facebook and Google for showing us your fear. Time to sell stocks in both companies if you still have some.
109 2018-03-14 23:16:54 Thank him for what? These tax cuts are temporary, while corporations (who are using their permanent breaks to buy back stocks and lay people off) are creating a trillion+ dollar debt.... that we will eventually have to pay by forfeiting SS and/or medicaire. Our future is bleak.
110 2018-03-14 23:16:42 Again the NRA is spinning this as you will lose your gun if you listen that’s not true Stricter gun laws and outlying bump stocks is what people are wanting the NRA is making you pick between guns and people. Because they are about money not lives

113 2018-03-14 23:14:01 he made steps to banning bump stocks used in the California shooting

it's progress at least.
114 2018-03-14 23:13:14 ok, I'll unpack that one at a time

1) background checks are universal and tight. want proof? go try to buy a gun

2) why bump stocks? to the average owner it doesn't effect anything

3) define assult weapons.
115 2018-03-14 23:13:11 A lack of available military grade weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines would be an honest start.
116 2018-03-14 23:13:11 School safety would be better served by getting rid of Betsy DeVos......and bump stocks and AR-15 in the hands of civilians.
117 2018-03-14 23:13:10 Reasonable gun control to include purchase of firearms limited to over age 21, ban bump stocks, ban automatic weapons. I don’t want to take legal rifles, or handguns. Tell me, who needs a military style weapon?
118 2018-03-14 23:12:43 Crazy thing is I probably wouldn’t have any investments right now if it wasn’t for my bf pushing me.... stocks, 401k, ROTH IRA these are thing early 20 year olds don’t talk about
119 2018-03-14 23:12:25 Your plan is an NRA agenda - majority of Americans want to ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, require mandatory background checks, close gun show loopholes, raise minimum age to 21
120 2018-03-14 23:12:14 How is it dark?

More jobs?
Bonuses?
Raise in pay?
Lower taxes?
Stocks up?
Pedos being arrested?
Corrupt politicians exposed?
The Kenyan caught?
Hillary caught? 

Pray tell, what's dark?
121 2018-03-14 23:10:39 Expanded background checks, ban of bump stocks and assault weapons. But your side only hears ‘total confiscation’. It’s tiring.

124 2018-03-14 23:09:40 Just sold the wheels now back to the stocks 
125 2018-03-14 23:09:31 I disagree, now is the time to accumulate while its quiet and stocks are trading tighter with less volatility.
126 2018-03-14 23:09:23 Why don’t YOU ban assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, strengthen background checks, end the gun show loophole, & create a national gun refectory system? This will do more than arming teachers. 

Stand up for what’s right, and against the NRA. Stop being cowardly
127 2018-03-14 23:09:00 @WallStPlayboys Just finished triangle investing, contains solid, ACTIONABLE advice, no BS. Had good info on how to value real estate and stocks, but there was nothing about valuing crypto or did I miss something? Or is the area too new to be able to make a meaningful valuation?
128 2018-03-14 23:08:45 so how do you explain target walmart and bestbuy that are all are doing great with their stocks all hitting all time highs? Online purchases aren't the problem, toysrus overpriced BS and outdated website is the problem.

132 2018-03-14 23:08:17 Roughly 1,300,000 people each year are killed by cars.

Roughly 1,600 people each year are killed by knives.

Roughly 400 people each year are killed by [ALL] rifles.

And you want to ban bump stocks?

REALLY???
133 2018-03-14 23:05:41 I like that, sensible gun control. Like banning large magazines in assault rifles, and banning the stocks that recoil to basically make a gun fully auto. Limit the number of guns a person can own? Limit the amount of ammo that can be purchased each year? Many things can change.

135 2018-03-14 23:04:06 Some ideas being discussed here and nationally: Preventing convicted domestic abusers from owning guns, expanded background checks, banning bump stocks and raising the age on rifle purchases from 18 to 21.
136 2018-03-14 23:04:01 Bullshit! Another band-aid on a sucking chest wound. The next school mass shooting is on YOUR HEADS @GOP @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN DO NOT let this discussion die like it did after Vegas. 0 WAS DONE about bump stocks after Vegas, we are PISSED WE WANT ACTION NOW
137 2018-03-14 23:03:52 Thanks for the warning. I’ll be transferring my 401k out of stocks and more into bonds. 2007 here we come.
138 2018-03-14 23:03:41 No problem. ToysRUs stocks a wider variety of Lego sets than Target. Also high-end transformers are usually exclusive to TRU. I'd like to see Target pick up the slack when TRU is gone.
139 2018-03-14 23:03:32 Technically that doesn't make it an assualt weapon but but does make it more assualt like.  I have no problem with outlawing bump stocks.

145 2018-03-14 23:00:31 We both know what weapons we' re talking about! Semi automatic, high capacity weapons! Bump stocks! What's really confounding is your fixation with a single type of weapon! Not all weapons! Seem to dance on the graves of these students, and its telling about your character!
146 2018-03-14 22:59:45 Bump stocks have the lowest sales in the market. They have to be specially ordered. Extended mags are also made for multiple target shooting for competitions. They literally are barely ever bought tho. My dad is a gun and archery dealer

No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows

150 2018-03-14 22:57:57 What about your statements about raising the age to 21 & bump stocks & banning AR 15. Guess the NRA got to you at the meeting. SMH
151 2018-03-14 22:56:51 So you have stocks? Must be nice to be rich.

154 2018-03-14 22:55:19 99.5% of crypto is ponzi schemes. At best 5 coins are going to survive, BTC, LTC, ETH, and you can plug in 2 here (xrp?Neo?). The rest of the coins are no different than pinksheet stocks on the stock market, made for day traders for pump and dump. Blockchain is the real value.
155 2018-03-14 22:55:08 Where is the ban on assault weapons of mass murder?  Where is the ban on bump stocks? Age limits? #banyoderinnovember

157 2018-03-14 22:54:18 I hope SA banks know better this time around then to be involved in unsavoury US stocks.
158 2018-03-14 22:53:50 Then listen to the kids and support the ban on bump stocks, assault weapons, magazines, instead of being a chickenshit and bowing down to the NRA

163 2018-03-14 22:52:10 Sure, no problem asking. I buy BTC to hold throughout my life and give to my children and grandchildren. Totally different than stocks, real estate, etc. When BTC goes to $100k+ I'll re-balance into other assets a bit, but only minimally.
164 2018-03-14 22:52:09 There is a third option. Britain keeps stocks of this chemical at their Porton Down laboratory...

170 2018-03-14 22:49:29 GREAT to ban bump stocks and raise age from 18-21 to buy guns. NOT ENOUGH. Citizens do NOT need military weapons of mass murder for ANY reason. BAN assault weapons period. Doing so WILL save lives

173 2018-03-14 22:48:44 But Obama had super majority did nothing; Congress not President passes laws; Obama Amin legalized Bump Stocks over NRA objections. This is just pathetic and shows their lack of sincerity

184 2018-03-14 22:43:14 Yeah, I wouldn't recommend anyone to do this, this is a very high-risk strategy & leveraging weed stocks is crazy if you can't afford to lose the money. But the best part is that the interest payments are tax-deductible :D

194 2018-03-14 22:38:30 Yes. And a well regulated militia is no longer REQUIRED for the security of the US and it was not written in a context covering assault rifles or bump stocks. Neither of which are required unless your intent is to kill as many people as fast as possible.
195 2018-03-14 22:38:06 Really? How about getting rid of assault weapons, bump stocks, large amounts of ammo, raising the age to purchase a gun to 21, a three day waiting period, following Massachusetts gun laws.

205 2018-03-14 22:33:03 Nobody wants your guns. What we want is enhanced background checks (to make sure criminals and mentally challenged don’t get them), close gun show loopholes, ban bump stocks, and ban military style weapons.
206 2018-03-14 22:32:43 And you STILL haven't signed the EO banning bump stocks that you said was "coming soon". I guess "coming soon" means at least two weeks. Come on, show the NRA that you aren't afraid of them. Chicken shit.

208 2018-03-14 22:31:29 Ha. Yes. I used to own it. But, to be honest, I thought management really dropped the ball so I sold in 2016. I basically broke even on my investment. I don't feel bad that I "missed" out as I put the money into other great stocks. I never look back.
209 2018-03-14 22:31:26 I’m not taking any action myself, Robert - mostly in debt anyway - but certainly wouldn’t be actively looking to buy stocks. Prefer to buy in a crisis.

214 2018-03-14 22:30:33 You’re right. Bump stocks make AR-15 virtually automatics.

237 2018-03-14 22:22:34 If Cramer doesn’t realize buybacks, M&A and Reaganomics do nothing for real growth, he should revisit ECON 101.  Zero economic growth plus insane fiscal policy equals recession and the tanking of stocks.

241 2018-03-14 22:21:06 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
242 2018-03-14 22:20:45 agree with this

245 2018-03-14 22:19:20 No, Trump is killing jobs in St. Louis. Get some facts. The absurd steel tariff already has caused job loses and stocks diving at Boeing - you know, that major employer that bought StL-based McDonnell Douglas abt 20 yrs ago, so controls those jobs.

247 2018-03-14 22:18:19 @realDonaldTrump if you do this, if you fire Mueller, you will succeed in energizing the biggest protest in American history. The world will watch, stocks will fall, market will spiral downward - and Mueller will obtain an injunction to stop your nonsense.
248 2018-03-14 22:18:17 Well I think you know I was referring to semi automatic assault rifles. There was a way forward had government and the gun industry acted responsibly but politicians took money and the gun industry made extra large magazines and bump stocks a message needs to sent

250 2018-03-14 22:16:45 Rex still had to sell all his Exxon stocks TAX FREE to take the job. So, don't feel sorry for him.
251 2018-03-14 22:16:38 Stocks
252 2018-03-14 22:15:20 If you make it shine the price will raise... when Facebook gave you stocks because they couldn’t afford fiat money in the beginning I guess you will pass huh?
253 2018-03-14 22:15:01 Universal background checks for every gun purchase 

Universal 3 day waiting period

No one under 21 allowed to have a seminauto 

Universal ban on bump stocks and silencers

Semi auto owners must have liability insurance 

They can pick one and start there
254 2018-03-14 22:15:00 So I have this other guy I follow and he says, that looking at bond market, it looks like someone's buying a lot of bonds (fed?) lowering yield, making the money flow to the stocks.  What do you think of it?  Is that bs?
255 2018-03-14 22:14:57 Go to stocks
256 2018-03-14 22:13:49 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines, first thing tomorrow morning
257 2018-03-14 22:13:17 Does 2A dictate that we must allow mentally ill to possess a firearm? Does it state an appropriate age for purchase of a rifle? Is it an "infringement" to deny an 18 year old, mentally unstable person from purchasing an assortment of ammo, bump stocks, and high-capacity mags??
258 2018-03-14 22:13:10 Quorn eaters in the UK, which supermarket stocks the biggest range of Quorn?
259 2018-03-14 22:13:06 @seanhannity I just researched #freedomchecks Dude, it sounds like a chop for penny stocks. Have you ever seen #boilerroom
260 2018-03-14 22:13:03 The GOVERNOR OF NC HEARD OUR CALL. MORE RESTRICTIONS ON GUNS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE RN and more extensive background checks!! He said they’re closing all loopholes in the background check process AND that bump stocks will not be available.
261 2018-03-14 22:12:43 $AYTU can’t ignore the volume today. Beaten down stocks like to try for rebounds and volume is always the clue. Watching this one in the morning.
262 2018-03-14 22:12:26 So anyone can still buy assault rifles and bump stocks? Weak. What about concert goers having bullets rained down on them from a high rise hotel room? Or people in church. Or the mall etc etc? Stop taking money from the NRA! #VoteThemOut #BoycottTheNRA #BoycottNRA
263 2018-03-14 22:11:58 Facts are not his strong suit.   He would rather call the student protests hitler youth like he did on another thread.   This guys in love with his bump stocks.
264 2018-03-14 22:11:28 Assault weapons. Bump stocks. Metal detectors. TSA caliber security. We’re looking for your solutions. Like real ones. Got any?
265 2018-03-14 22:11:22 Right on Marius, they are tinkering with us, trying to confuse us... playing stocks up yesterday and then continuing the tank today. Good call!
266 2018-03-14 22:11:14 I’m sorry. After this long, rambling series of tweets, which is obviously coming from your heart, the one unique solution you offer up is getting rid of collapsible/detachable stocks. Why? I just don’t get it.
267 2018-03-14 22:11:03 You might want to hire new researchers or find legitimate channels of information. This is exhausting, but, no one is asking you to disarm, stop panicking, we’d like our kids to be safe at school, maniacs not get bump stocks & reasonable checks like to drive a goddamn car.
268 2018-03-14 22:11:00 The common denominator in every mass shooting is the......weapon. Ban assault weapons, high capacity clips and bump stocks.
269 2018-03-14 22:10:42 Stocks going higher on big volume is bullish? Without follow through it's signaling there's more sell interest than buy interest ex $AMD

272 2018-03-14 22:09:06 You can do that by banning assault weapons, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, universal background checks.
273 2018-03-14 22:08:41 A friend picked one off ebay just a couple of weeks back: "The Richard D. Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks" (2 volumes)

276 2018-03-14 22:07:57 I don’t remember hearing that you were busy when president anyways? 10trillion in debt, gender issues, black unemployment didn’t improve as well as my stocks.
277 2018-03-14 22:07:32 Their stocks are tumbling also.
278 2018-03-14 22:07:30 all stocks r pump and dumps
279 2018-03-14 22:07:28 I thought you stated that your corporate tax cuts would generate jobs.  Now I here is that corporations are really not investing , but are buying up stocks.  Lied again!!! Fake Donald trump
280 2018-03-14 22:07:01 @GOP What about taking action on the gun side of the ledger, like banning bump stocks and AR-15s?
281 2018-03-14 22:06:54 There's really nothing left to ban, except bump stocks. But, that's not actually a gun, but a modification.
282 2018-03-14 22:06:28 Really sorry about that, Stacey. The team were working hard on getting it resolved as soon as possible, and with 2 full screens the sweets were only available whilst stocks lasted.
283 2018-03-14 22:05:18 Thanks for contributing to the decimation of the ocean's fish stocks and promoting cruelity to fish
284 2018-03-14 22:05:15 Boeing stocks took a crap today because of YOUR tariffs.
285 2018-03-14 22:04:53 Cars are made transport people
Rifles are made for hunting 
Handguns are for self defense 
But assult weapons with bumps stocks and extended magazines are for killing as many people as possible
286 2018-03-14 22:04:02 Hey @CalSTRS & @CalPERS! We support @CalTreasurer's initiative to divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks and similar dangerous accessories that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one! #DivestForOurLives #DefundGuns #DrainTheNRA
287 2018-03-14 22:03:42 Luckily I’m not at a loss yet. I was thinking buy back at the bottom, $6,000. Oh and yea, my stocks are sucking bad as well. Lol.
288 2018-03-14 22:02:46 The largest marijuana companies will see their stocks rise 10 fold in 10 years.  The S&P 500 will see a recession in 2019/2020 but will double in 10 years.  Bitcoin might see a 5-10 fold in 5-7 years before falling again.
289 2018-03-14 22:02:25 Wow.
My Boeing stocks got hammered today because of Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs.
Thank you Trump.
290 2018-03-14 22:02:00 The Dow has closed beneath the previous day's low for 2 days in a row. The run last extended to 3 days on 30 December 2016, 302 trading days ago #stocks
291 2018-03-14 22:01:53 Sovereign bonds around the world gained ground while stocks suffered fresh losses, with industrials leading the way lower as the latest upheaval in the Trump administration fed into concerns over the possibility of a global trade war.  FT
292 2018-03-14 22:00:58 Don't you think it was kinda... LACKING? As in any meaningful change. Not only didn't it include the age 21 restriction, it doesn't include "Bump Stocks" either. SOMEONE needs to protect us, and it clearly isn't going to be you!
293 2018-03-14 22:00:37 Maybe not Larry's very best work but you're making it sound as if his point was go to war because war helps stocks. That was NOT his point at all. His point was that fear of terrorism was restraining US economic activity. Might not have been right, but u are mischaracterizing.
294 2018-03-14 22:00:15 I like the assault weapon ban; no more than a 10 round clip & no bumper stocks. Tracer rounds, armor piercing, cop killer bullets banned. Too often, I see law enforcement outgunned. I am for background checks, over 21, & loss of weapons for mental disability or domestic assaults.
295 2018-03-14 22:00:13 How is 3M 180k? it's not a salary so it's not PAYE. It would be like tax free stocks or something
296 2018-03-14 21:59:51 Wouldn't that apply ONLY to critics that own stocks?

Then fully auto 3 we get 2 modes safety and semi auto
299 2018-03-14 21:59:02 He leaders willing to accept ITS politicization and instead of consulting and reasonably like...one accessory capable of restriction is detachable stocks or collapsing under 30”, I think that’s not outrageous and 21+, 3 day wait and background checks and YES school security ad so
300 2018-03-14 21:58:41 Nice to know you are going to give the UK a response
Mr Putin. 
Advise us how Military Grade Nerve Gas produced only
by Russia and supposedly banned from production and
all stocks destroyed in the 1990s found its way to the UK.
The UK looks forward to your response.
301 2018-03-14 21:57:59 Increasing tax on billionaire's does not hurt them they just put the money in  stocks bonds and other assets which is impossible to tax. You are only hurting the middle class with these regulations making it difficult for small businesses to start and one day rival large business
302 2018-03-14 21:56:58 You are doing nothing. We had a ban on assault style weapons before in 1984-2004. Why not do it again and add mega magazines,bump stocks,age limit to 21,stricter background regulations and close gun show loopholes.
303 2018-03-14 21:56:46 Who was it who said ,  I'll raise age from 18 to 21, I'll ban bump stocks and famously stated You guys are scared of the NRA?  We all know who. We also know what happened after that same person had 2 meetings that same week with the NRA. Why should anyone be surprised anymore?
304 2018-03-14 21:56:31 Troy Vincent is in the discussion
305 2018-03-14 21:55:49 Been a lifetime member since I was 10 yrs old. I can agree with no bump stocks as to banning a legal firearm is just the first step towards disarming our country. There are also other avenues to commit mass killings other than guns.

311 2018-03-14 21:54:42 All these so called smart analysts only recommend stocks that have already shot up. By the time we know, they are already in it and waiting to come out.

314 2018-03-14 21:54:13 What the hell is the Stop School Violence Act. Sounds like a nothing burger. What happened to your commitment to raise the age to 21 and banning bump stocks. Oh yea, you lied. Only this time to a bunch of victimized kids.  Well the jokes on you Trump. 2020 voters coming right up.

318 2018-03-14 21:52:48 STOP supporting NRA - No silencers, no bump stocks, no cop killer rounds, no super shooter magazines, comprehensive background checks, and NO countrywide concealed carry reciprocity!!!!!!!
319 2018-03-14 21:52:35 Yes you can't say we didn't try, we're working hard here, depleting our Good-Vibe stocks and generally keeping our fingers crossed!
320 2018-03-14 21:52:07 We have stocks of many nerve agents
321 2018-03-14 21:51:44 Both make enough to have more fiat and more crypto. That’s how it’s worked so far. I have held stocks and it’s so slow to make good money if possible. What would you suggest as an investment? If it’s gold don’t bother held some for years with a tiny profit.
322 2018-03-14 21:51:38 buy buy buy!  Tell all the fellow Trump supporters to help build Trump's economy and buy all the stocks you can!  buy buy buy!!  get the word out! #SupportTrumpBuyStocks
323 2018-03-14 21:51:21 @darksecretplace Why do you keep talking about the 2nd amend. every other sentence? It's about sensible gun legislation that's supported by most Americans and used to be supported by the NRA. Universal bckgrnd checks, Banning bump stocks and military grade ammunition and weapons

325 2018-03-14 21:51:13 If Obama wasn't in the pocket of NRA why didn't he do anything? Obama allowed Bump Stocks even. Dems could have come forward with a bill on Daca and Guns. Nope nothing
326 2018-03-14 21:50:07 People don’t want a repeal of the second amendment.

They do want some or all of the following:
Ban on military grade guns
Ban high capacity clips
Ban bump stocks
Stricter background checks
Require gun handling and safety training
327 2018-03-14 21:50:04 Damn stocks really beat me up today
328 2018-03-14 21:49:53 @UGG can you help me find Ugg Bonham in Grey, in womens 8.5?  hear they run wide so will order true to size but can't find any website that stocks them.  My hopes are held high...
329 2018-03-14 21:49:48 The same way Stocks are not allowed to advertise.
330 2018-03-14 21:49:30 I'm delighted to *announce* that my publisher Alba has ordered a second print run of 'Elsewhere', since stocks are very low! Numbers are never huge in poetry sales but it's still very heartening to sell out just 15 weeks after the launch! (1/2)
331 2018-03-14 21:49:20 imo the question should be "should bump stocks/conversion kits be legal at all?" (I don't think they should), not "can we sue someone for making a legal product that was functioning as intended?" (albeit used to break the law).
332 2018-03-14 21:49:05 stocks recap from todays watchlist (under $5) $DPW ↑ $0.01 $WIN ↑ $0.03 $MYSZ ↓ $0.10 $PLUG ↓ $0.03 $MARA ↓ $0.19 $VEON ↓ $0.02 $AVP ↑ $0.02 $CHK ↓ $0.09 $ZNGA ↑ $0.07 $HMNY ↓ $0.07

334 2018-03-14 21:48:50 Unfortunately,  you're in the pocket of the NRA, so you propose exactly the wrong steps! Instead:
-ban semi-automatic weapons; 
-ban bump stocks;
-automate gun registrations and background checks; 
-allow the CDC to study gun violence.

338 2018-03-14 21:47:04 We must make safety a priority Everywhere. Not just in schools. The only way to accomplish this is gun regulations. Increase Age/Waiting periods. More intense background checks. Ban Bump Stocks and All Assault type weapons. Limit ammo purchases.
339 2018-03-14 21:46:50 Julian Bossange: buy Boss Stocks low NOW, price/share will Quadruple + 20% by 5pm PST

341 2018-03-14 21:46:26 Twitter drama. Keep me out of it please. Ill say stocks how i see it. If you dont like it block me or dont listen but keep me out of drama please! if I think its a short ill say. If I think its a long ill say! i am a fair SHORT TERM day trader so take it for what it is! :)
342 2018-03-14 21:46:19 I love you guys, my Depends Stock just keeps going up and up... Every time you all start spewing your idiotic comments about there is going to be problems if they come for my guns... Keep stocking up and my stocks keep going up...
343 2018-03-14 21:46:14 @Stocktwits Super bullish for the energy stocks. Most get out at the bottom. That's when they throw in the towel because its too painful.

My local Tesco stocks 4 monthly Linux user magazines. I always wonder how many they actually sell.
346 2018-03-14 21:45:43 Unfortunately are kids are being used as media and political pawns. Until schools are treated like airports, stadiums, court houses and city halls, the kids will not be safe.

Stop fooling yourself if you think it’s about bump stocks, AR-15’s or 18 year olds with guns.
347 2018-03-14 21:45:40 I usually get on Twitter for stocks news & such but all this week I've been on for the NFL free agency/trades
348 2018-03-14 21:45:00 I don’t think purely high beta stocks make sense in IRAs because you miss out on harvesting losses when you lose. You’re better off putting your high dividend stocks in IRAs to avoid the cap gains
349 2018-03-14 21:44:59 Have you read it?  It does not speak of guns, bump stocks, age , etc. it will be flooded with pork belly projects. Only passed to get budget through. It’s a waste, like you.
350 2018-03-14 21:44:48 Common sense would tell you that fewer assault weapons result in fewer massacres. Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
351 2018-03-14 21:44:29 Didn't Trump say something about banning bump stocks, and raising the age to buy assault type weapons to 21? Is that in this bill or was Trump just blowing out wind?
352 2018-03-14 21:44:27 Wth does this mean ? Stocks are up 35% in a YEAR!!!!
353 2018-03-14 21:43:18 Thanks for all of these! I think the gun control one should say "a ban on bump stocks" instead, but I'm sure people will know what to say on the phone. ;)
354 2018-03-14 21:43:12 Right migrants took them off the air to manipulate stocks that never existed in first place! ©®Ponzu public schools no longer allowed! Count migrants! Same for all being fooled by addicts addictions practices. Not religious either and those are also outlawed. Validation day
355 2018-03-14 21:42:38 @GovMurphy @njassemblydems @NJSenDems @FrankPallone @SenBooker @SenatorMenendez I call on NJ lawmakers to divest from gun & ammo stocks in public pensions & reinvest in solar, wind, EVs & cannabis stocks like BLOZF!!!
356 2018-03-14 21:42:32 A good opportunity to short stocks.

358 2018-03-14 21:42:23 Because the upper class own the stocks of weapon manufacturers!
359 2018-03-14 21:40:46 @henrymcmaster you are on the wrong side of history. These students raised their voices to stop violence in their schools.  They're asking for sensible gun laws that 89% of Americans support like stricter background checks, banning bump stocks & raising the minimum age. #Enough
360 2018-03-14 21:39:32 Do SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY STOP THE KILLING!! Universal background checks,  longer waiting period, raise age limit to 21 years, BAN assault style weapons except for military,  BAN bump stocks, BAN domestic ABUSERS from getting weapons. DO SOMETHING ABOUT gun control
361 2018-03-14 21:39:32 Yea, sure...nothing you say can be trusted. 

The Republicans are all bought and paid for by the NRA. 

Raise the age to 21!
30 day wait period!
Extremely vetted applications!
Ban military style weapons!
Ban bump stocks!

#NeverAgain

A teacher in CA had his gun go off today!
362 2018-03-14 21:39:08 What's happening is corporations are just using the vast majority of the money for stock buy backs - which helps investors but no one else. We are borrowing $1.5 TRILLION and 30% of stocks are owned by foreigners. Just bad economics.
363 2018-03-14 21:39:01 how the volatility love it mice and windy! SYSTEM BOUGHT 100 CONTRACTS OF COPPER TODAY SHORT 10 YR 30 YR RATES ON THE MOVE STOCKS WILL PLUMMET! IT'S A FACT YOU CANNOT EARN YOUR WAY OUT OF OBAMA'S STUPID MONETARY POLICIES THE HIT IN THE FACE IS COMING AND BIG! @damianpinto
364 2018-03-14 21:38:47 Put your big boy pants on and defy the NRA.  Ban AR 15’s and bump stocks, beef up background checks and wait times, disallow the mentally ill and younger than 21 set from gun purchase. You want to be a disrupter? Here’s your chance.
365 2018-03-14 21:38:10 I literally don’t even know what your talking about. Are you talking about bump stocks? You know the argument is about more extensive background checks and raising the age to buy a gun... right?
366 2018-03-14 21:37:32 i thought you said raise the age to 21! bump stocks - GONE- great background checks - oh that's right - THAT IS THE TRUMP BULLSHIT - that is all for show -he's on the phone again PHONEY - you could care less - RE- JECT-ED!! hey exclamation points!
367 2018-03-14 21:37:31 Ban AR15s and bump stocks and get back to raising the age to 21. You know that's the right to do. They got to you in one day ~sad~.
368 2018-03-14 21:36:39 Bump stocks were held accountable. They weren't used at Parkland but got banned in Florida. #thefive
369 2018-03-14 21:35:48 U.S stocks had come under pressure as investors worried that U.S tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt firms use the metals on manufacturer goods
370 2018-03-14 21:35:40 They are desperate for you not to succeed. Jobs, lower taxes, stocks, economy better than ever. I don't get it??

372 2018-03-14 21:34:42 And what part of universal background checks, no bump stocks, and closing the gun show loophole equals disarmament? Grow up.

380 2018-03-14 21:33:27 Yer we are all rich because we are on the pension,(Not),
Maybe if your an x politician or x ceo, not everyone knows how to play with stocks.and there are not that many rich pensioners. Yes tax the rich they had it good most of there lives. Why not tax them
381 2018-03-14 21:33:17 #HeySmartGuy. Do your duty and ban assault rifles, bump stocks and strengthen background checks. Otherwise you will forever be known as the NRA’s puppet. Get a spine and do the right thing for once. Maybe everyone won’t hate you as much.
382 2018-03-14 21:33:12 Did it increase the age to buy assault weapons to 21, get rid of bump stocks, get rid of high-capacity magazines, require universal background checks, Increased funding for mental health and counseling at schools?
383 2018-03-14 21:32:39 Stocks and Bonds....stocks and Bonds
384 2018-03-14 21:32:37 End Planned Parenthood lobbying. Ban abortion. Re-institute prayer in school. You can keep the bump stocks. #2A
385 2018-03-14 21:32:35 The kids and 97% of the US want stronger gun control, age limit 21, no bump stocks....
386 2018-03-14 21:32:25 you see, I'm old school. the way I learned it is that it's a market of stocks
387 2018-03-14 21:32:14 Background checks...at local gun shows?? Bump stocks...can do the same with a rubber band but I know you don't watch YouTube. The latest trained teacher in CA just misfired a weapon and injured a student...in a training class not an emergency.
388 2018-03-14 21:32:11 Diversify your #investments that include a broad mix of stocks and bonds. Have an exit strategy to manage your risk.
389 2018-03-14 21:31:48 Its not just #crypto,  #stocks are getting #hammered too! People calm down!  #btcprivate #BTCP #BTC
390 2018-03-14 21:31:44 Insider trading on breaches is stupid. Track record for stocks falling over mid term is actually pretty low.
391 2018-03-14 21:31:29 What happened to changing the age requirements?  Where are you on bump stocks?  #NRABloodMoney got you by the balls?
392 2018-03-14 21:30:01 Raise age to 21, ban assault rifles and bumb stocks. That will help.
393 2018-03-14 21:29:58 Couldn’t agree more, get the bump stocks and AR-15’s off thexsteeet and get us universal background checks, oh right, you’re afraid of the NRA, sorry I asked
394 2018-03-14 21:29:41 That’s why their stocks are down.
395 2018-03-14 21:29:25 So do something about the guns ya meathead. Eliminate assault style rifles. Bam bump stocks. Make mandatory 14 day wait periods for gun purchases. Raise the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21. Do something that actually helps!
396 2018-03-14 21:29:18 did they? i thought they just bought stocks
397 2018-03-14 21:29:00 Texas is also the State that gets the most @NRA blood money, where felons can buy AR-15s undetected at gun shows, bump stocks are legal, assault weapons unregistered and 26 church folk murdered by a psycho with an AR-15 and TX Republicans did nothing
398 2018-03-14 21:28:59 “The reason insider trading is illegal is because it gives the insider an unfair advantage in the market, puts the interests of the insider above those to whom he or she owes a fiduciary duty, and allows an insider to artificially influence the value of a company's stocks.”
399 2018-03-14 21:28:59 So universal background checks, minimum age for purchase of assault rifles and banning bump stocks are ALL in that bill right?  Those are the things you said you wanted on live TV when you said you were not afraid of the #NRA.  But then they got you alone .... #papertiger
400 2018-03-14 21:28:53 Great then should be easy to ban bump stocks.
401 2018-03-14 21:28:53 So my stocks don’t vest til May. I’m pissed.
402 2018-03-14 21:27:17 You want to give some room below support to allow the stock to trade. That can vary among stocks depending upon how volatile they are. ATR allows you to vary it by the stock's normal volatility
403 2018-03-14 21:26:54 No shit: "MLP stocks face 'quagmire,' lag rest of energy sector"
404 2018-03-14 21:24:46 What about bump stocks?

406 2018-03-14 21:23:27 It was based on her owning 50% shares of a company valued at $9 billion then they revalued it to $800 million and realized her stocks were worthless
407 2018-03-14 21:22:55 I've had friends with bump stocks and third gun would jam at 5 rounds. Others would be 15. Most of the LV shooters guns we're found to be jammed as well.

413 2018-03-14 21:19:57 A Brain Genius: "AR-15s aren't machine guns. Don't call them that. Machine guns are banned, so nobody has one."
Me: okay.
Brain Genius: "But also we can't ban AR-15s or bump stocks because it won't make a difference; people get hold of banned things all the time."
Me: 
414 2018-03-14 21:19:51 Someone who is a rookie at this would be way behind what Keanu Reeves is at any point in that video. Someone with a bump stock will not be able to do what he does. Again bump stocks damage a gun. What counts is the person and their training.
415 2018-03-14 21:19:50 I’m going to enjoy watching United writhe in agony as their PR goes even further down the shitter and their stocks plummet.
416 2018-03-14 21:19:01 Do US listed Chinese stocks have the same track record as UK listed Chinese stocks ? Camkids, BNN, Naibu etc in the UK suggest that you should be v circumspect of the “value” they offer. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.
417 2018-03-14 21:17:12 Also automatic weapons are ALREADY illegal except for police and military, so what’s all the BS about bump stocks? They are already illegal. My God, dosn’t anybody have any common sense at all? When you pass a bill BE SPECIFIC.
418 2018-03-14 21:16:37 I'm not sold on an outright ban of AR-15's, but I do think high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. need to be banned. I also feel that if you want to own an AR type gun, you should have to go through the same processes as you would for owning a fully automatic firearm.

420 2018-03-14 21:15:21 BlockChain stocks will be affected indeed, but, doesn't have much to do with $SX. only if $SX would be working on mining itself or mining technology---right?
421 2018-03-14 21:15:04 Unconscious need to put blame on certain stocks on down days vs. universal glowing euphoria on up days is an unbalanced approach. Cheerleading 101.

425 2018-03-14 21:12:44 I live in the damned county w/ nothing but a county sheriff. I know the pain. Not saying all guns should go. I'm saying deep police entry level background checks. I'm saying bump stocks & YouTube vids showing how to shave the firing pins can't be legal.

430 2018-03-14 21:11:04 The movement is not saying to ban all guns, even if deep down it is what they want.  They want a middle ground. Stronger backgrounds, waiting periods, elimination of bump stocks, etc.  why can’t we all just find a middle ground instead of attacking each other!?!

462 2018-03-14 20:59:09 This doesn’t do shit.  How about close the gun show loophole , mandatory background checks, bump stocks made illegal, more money for mental illness, raise minimum age for assault weapon to 21, no fly list ban, domestic abuse ban on weapons purchase. You’re such a dipshit.
463 2018-03-14 20:58:29 Pot over s&p. Got pot stocks.
464 2018-03-14 20:58:11 as far as i know there are no bump stocks for pistols
465 2018-03-14 20:57:26 Getting rid of bump stocks and “assault rifles” won’t help with anything.  There’s still a human behind each shooting.
466 2018-03-14 20:57:21 Ban all assault weapons!
They have one purpose. 
Kill lots of people quickly.

No cop killing armor piecing bullets
Banana clips
No bump stocks 
Age 21
Keep all guns out of schools

Amen to common sense!
467 2018-03-14 20:57:07 I never heard anyone dictating -Take all the guns from the people, JUST military rifles, and bump stocks-Your watching to much FOX--!!

Try assault weapon ban, no-fly list means no gun purchases, ban bump stocks & those kind of common sense things
472 2018-03-14 20:56:27 Heavy hitters starting to sell their stocks (and bonds) and going to cash. Looks like the Trump Depression has begun. Good luck to us all. ETTD
473 2018-03-14 20:56:10 Also, online buying. Gun show loopholes. Bump stocks. Not taking away guns. Thorough back ground checks.  I can’t say it enough. I don’t care if you have a damn gun. I don’t want to take it away. Unless you can’t pass the above requirements.
474 2018-03-14 20:55:44 LOL! If this assessment is as good as your ‘stocks will crash if Trump elected’ prediction, then @realDonaldTrump nailed this selection.

478 2018-03-14 20:53:49 Banning bump stocks is such low hanging fruit. Obviously they should be banned. Now how about something with more substance, like all semi-automatic rifles?
479 2018-03-14 20:53:26 It really sux when your making a profit trading stocks but you can't sell your shares to bank on it because it's after hours and your account is too small for after hours trading!! Please hold this price (or higher) at market open!! Ugh!

482 2018-03-14 20:51:59 That's helping the wrong end of the problem.  It's time to stand up to the NRA and pass something meaningful.  Repeal Dickey so the CDC can study gun violence, ban bump stocks, make it harder to get military style weapons.  You know things that will actually help.

484 2018-03-14 20:50:46 @RobinhoodApp Why would you choose to prioritize the cryptocurrency watchlist above owned stocks? If you're not planning to provide an option to reorder sections in the app, at least put anything on a watchlist below anything you own...seems way more practical.
485 2018-03-14 20:50:31 @kodyevans21  Those stocks sure look like they’d hold you in place no matter how ticklish you are!
486 2018-03-14 20:50:23 You nailed it once again big time! Just one thing that I don’t understand: if they want stocks up and cryptos down, isn’t that  going to be tricky with regards to the correlation of the two assets?
487 2018-03-14 20:49:34 If truly in charge, I'd begin by accessing best possible information and consulting those with deep understanding. With info I have as a citizen: improve background check system, age 21 to purchase, not sell bump stocks or the military-style weapons.
488 2018-03-14 20:47:58 What ever happened to banning bump stocks? Did you actually follow through with that?

491 2018-03-14 20:46:52 Market Update: stocks closed lower amid ongoing concerns of a China trade war as S&P looks to confirm support.
492 2018-03-14 20:46:46 Porton Down is a world renowned facility - often samples from Syria are tested there - we don't have stocks, we have the top experts and scientists.
493 2018-03-14 20:46:45 PD must have synthesised it (is my understanding) but I am not suggesting they are responsible.  I simply mention it in response to the idea that only the Russian Govt has access to it. If PD can do it so can others. What is the evidence that Russia has stocks?
494 2018-03-14 20:45:18 I’m new to the realm, and it’s crazy cuz Im to the point now where I can scan for these stocks. Build a nice watchlist. analyze these stocks, and understand the patterns.. but my timing is just off still. But hey, who said progression was quick n easy. #LearnedFromESP
495 2018-03-14 20:45:15 Of CW stocks
496 2018-03-14 20:44:41 @TrueGritTree the colour of the water perfect for bass. 3 weeks to go before I prove there is nothing wrong with our local stocks.
497 2018-03-14 20:44:24 What about ARs? What about bump stocks?
498 2018-03-14 20:44:14 No gun show loophole, no concealed carry reciprocity, no bump stocks, for starters
499 2018-03-14 20:43:59 Hey Jessica, I'm sorry about this. I can confirm our Bolton store does stock Rankin Selection Brown Soda Bread which is due for a fresh delivery. Unfortunately the Bolton store no longer stocks Tayto crisps...1/2
500 2018-03-14 20:43:45 I see stocks breaking out from consolidations, not breaking down from massive tops. What do you see?
501 2018-03-14 20:42:43 If this doesn’t raise the age to buy a weapon, increase time for background checks, ban assault type weapons and bump stocks then YOU HAVE FAILED US...the children, their families, the American value system AND the constitution ! Shame on you!
502 2018-03-14 20:42:34 I wonder if he's going to unload stocks and $$ into her account in case assets are frozen
503 2018-03-14 20:42:04 Don't they know Obama legalized bump stocks?
504 2018-03-14 20:41:32 Any multi shot device?   No
Anything thats SCARY looking?  Please

You want to outlaw bump stocks?  Great... they're stupid AND dangerous

You want to keep arms out of the hands of the deranged... great... enforce NICS

Beyond that... you need to be VERY specific
505 2018-03-14 20:41:20 All Russian stocks of which were verified destroyed by the OPCW. 

So the evidence that currently is available does not lead to undeniable proof of culpability.
506 2018-03-14 20:40:30 What freedom is really being sacrificed if gun owners are asked to do lengthier background checks, go through stricter licensing phases and gun extras like bump stocks are outlawed? You have to do that for a license to drive, why not to buy a gun? That’s not a lack of freedom.
507 2018-03-14 20:40:17 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
508 2018-03-14 20:39:58 Slippery slope will be argued ad nauseam, it’s nonsense. The boogeyman can’t change the constitution, including 2nd amedt. and has no desire to. Butt stocks, really? AR15, AK47, really? Armageddon, zombie attacks? Coming to take your guns? Love the neighbor!
509 2018-03-14 20:38:46 Another #dividend increase in the books!! $WSM increased its dividend by 10%! #passiveincome #retirementplanning #stocks #StockMarketToday #StockMarketInsights
510 2018-03-14 20:38:11 Yea i been playing with these penny stocks. I think I’m good at it. Still don’t know shit lmaaaooooo
511 2018-03-14 20:37:55 I’m mostly invested in stocks that pay dividends. And I sold ~50% of my holdings back in Jan. Trump supporters are gonna have to realize he is not helping the economy or the market.
512 2018-03-14 20:37:20 Same here. My original $REZ position was in at 0.40, then bought up all the way up into the low 0.50s and bought all the way back down into the 0.30s Not worried seeing as most lithium stocks declined 40 to 60 percent bogus on supply scare news. Turnaround seems underway now 
513 2018-03-14 20:37:05 while I'm no fan whatsoever of the odious Putin regime in Russia, I do wonder what other states have access to or have developed stocks of novichok, as well as private intel work done by Skripal in recent years
514 2018-03-14 20:36:44 Maker-taker pilot might improve liquidity for Nasdaq/NYSE stocks trading under a buck, as they were never eligible for ECN rebates, and the fees really add up.
515 2018-03-14 20:36:37 No stocks of what?

Isn’t submission of evidence to an independent body an appropriate way to deal with disputes? If UK govt has evidence to justify its accusations shouldn’t May be chomping at the bit to offer this evidence up to scrutiny? Should it not be required to do so?
516 2018-03-14 20:36:10 Let’s have a look at what you could have won..
517 2018-03-14 20:34:09 THEY ARE OUT OF STOCKS CRIES
518 2018-03-14 20:33:42 THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND WILL NOT HELP. 
1. Age increase for purchasing 
2.Increased background checks and annual licensing 
3. Reduce magazine size/ get rid of automatics or bump stocks 

Giving more people guns is what the NRA WANTS. You’re so bought and paid for.
519 2018-03-14 20:33:26 Yes me too, will be lovely to catch up ... I need at least 3 of the Original, stocks are down to one in use & one in cupboard, makes me nervous, don't want to run out @popeyeuk1 wants some of the spreadable too 
520 2018-03-14 20:33:10 gift books or other knowledge imparting stuffs rather than a perfume or a photo frame..

gift mutual funds bonds stocks gold silver (if not books)
521 2018-03-14 20:31:52 @FBIMemphis #GaryNandwani had caused $100,000 to my cousine brother #Ajay by threatening his professor who was advising him in #Stocks, so my parent don't get monthly payment & that's why I received only $2,000 from him when I went back home in 1999-2000.
522 2018-03-14 20:31:51 You look at project and the team and token economy and if makes sense then you  jump. Doesn't matter stocks or crypto
523 2018-03-14 20:31:18 try not to be so puritanical about stocks all the time.  for some (me) a small percentage of my $ is in stocks that i "slow" trade on news. i've made substantial pile doing that smartly over the years. Cue --> our normal caveats
524 2018-03-14 20:31:10 $SPX -0.6%
China accelerates
US Retail Sales slow
Bonds UP, Banks break down
WH talks tough China trade
and US Industrial stocks fall
525 2018-03-14 20:31:05 1. 1st it is age limits , bump stocks .
2. then it will be AR-15's 
3. later it will be magazines that carry 10 bullets or more. 
4. Then it will be automatic pistols 
5. then it will be rifles all together. 
6. shotguns and revolvers 
7. nothing 
8. 2nd amendment has imploded
526 2018-03-14 20:30:48 I have everything else from Apple. Time to get some for their stocks 
527 2018-03-14 20:30:47 Not good enough  Remember this date November 6, 2018.  The day GOP members will be voted into oblivion.  Make America Safe Again.  Ban semi-automatic weapons, extended magazines and bump stocks.
528 2018-03-14 20:30:36 I own a few marijuana stocks and as of yet they haven't done much.  Crypto currency seems to be the way of the future.
529 2018-03-14 20:30:21 I'd be down for that
Like 2 stocks at STR or something
530 2018-03-14 20:30:09 If @netflix makes this deal; I will be cancelling our subscription and selling all my stocks
531 2018-03-14 20:29:49 Why do I get so much joy when stocks drop oh I know the republicans lose millions
532 2018-03-14 20:28:37 Yasss! @ASOS now stocks @MACcosmetics 
533 2018-03-14 20:28:01 $DOW down 700 points from Monday’s highs, and everyone yawns... because after the last 9 years everyone has learned; when it comes to stocks, there is absolutely nothing to worry about. 
$ES $SPY
534 2018-03-14 20:27:46 So the House passed the #StopSchoolViolenceAct but it WON’T 
•Solve gun prob
•Improve the background process 
•Ban bump stocks 
•Raise the age to 21
It will help troubled students who need help get help and it got approval from the @NRA so it’s all good. #GunReformNow
535 2018-03-14 20:26:52 Someone really has to teach me how to read these stocks.
536 2018-03-14 20:26:40 The human hunting rifle. No, we don't want all your flipping guns. Just AR15s, bump stocks, ammo limits, mentally ill unable to buy guns. DV and felons unable to get guns.
What a nauseating, inappropriate ad. 17 dead students and teachers remembered. No words 4 insane cruelty.
537 2018-03-14 20:25:51 Yea they banned semi-automatic weapons, extended magazines and bump stocks.  What a bunch of spineless b-tards.  November 2018......

541 2018-03-14 20:25:03 Well petition government and the EU in regard to fishing and managing fish stocks. It’s going to need a combined effort. Or more cormorants will come inland the same as gulls have.
542 2018-03-14 20:24:21 If you really cared  you get rid of bump stocks and assault weapons   We pay a well armed Militia!   So if folks want the second amendment  they can have thier 1 BULLET  Guns  we agree  From aburned out  shell of a PA  voter
543 2018-03-14 20:23:44 Dow falls 249 as Trump trade fears weigh on stocks
544 2018-03-14 20:23:39 the economy. You have a bucket of money in stocks or are you excited about $1.50 per week while the Koch bros get $1billion?
545 2018-03-14 20:22:41 I'm sorry, Rep Rutherford, but I agree w citizen above. This is not what we want. End #NRA rule & political payoffs. Military-style assault weapons should stay w the military. Outlaw bump stocks. Limit magazine capacity. And please put an end to the "ghost gun" industry.
546 2018-03-14 20:22:39 Stocks down.    Trade war w/China.
547 2018-03-14 20:22:06 "No stocks left" Obviously, I'm no chemist but if there are any on twitter can they explain if no stocks why would they need a sample for cross comparisons with past batches?
548 2018-03-14 20:22:03 Thank you for your plan to introduce bill to ban bump stocks, limit ammo, and raise the age. My friends and I are behind you! @KlughGregory
549 2018-03-14 20:21:52 I've been relying on the Stocks app that came w m iPhone, but it could use a little more functionality. I'll def give the Yahoo app a try.
550 2018-03-14 20:21:33 This awful incident is incredibly complex. If Russia sponsored it they won't admit it. If they have missing stocks of the chemical they won't admit it because they will look incompetent. Hard proof should be sought but also needed to rattle the cage. Messy world we live in.

552 2018-03-14 20:21:09 how about: No fly list=no gun buys / banning bump stocks/ background check for all gun buys/ raising age for semi's to 21/ Not allow mentally challenged to buy weapons/ have statea share information for background checks....There's 6 ideas. I'll take 2 of them.
553 2018-03-14 20:20:47 World stocks continue decline: US -.6%; Europe -.2%. Trade war fear rose as both US & European leaders made remarks that stirred the pot. Count on short-term volatility with the potential for another 1-2 day sharp drop. Longer-term still looks O.K for a single digit 2018 increase
554 2018-03-14 20:20:16 Women are better than men at picking stocks for trading.
555 2018-03-14 20:20:15 What’s the weather like?   An for next week?   Please check the stocks for me!!   Check with me later , I know I will need some other things done.   lol

573 2018-03-14 20:17:22 .@RussiaUN: Russia has destroyed all existing stocks of #ChemicalWeapons, verified by @OPCW (by the way, US hasn't destroyed its stock). If UK experts are convinced that it is #novochok, then they have samples, sources & can make it. What is the best kind of proof? Suspicion.
574 2018-03-14 20:16:45 Faith lost in Paul Ryan after Las Vegas ...said he didn't have knowledge of bump stocks. Why the h@ll not?  how can you make informed legislation if you don't do your homework?
575 2018-03-14 20:16:13 Congress is literally doing EVERYTHING to prevent people from getting abortions in the US by putting restriction upon restriction and regulation upon regulation on abortion clinincs while at the same time not even managing to get bump stocks banned

You're a laughingstock
576 2018-03-14 20:15:51 Well...Stocks up, Unemployment down, taxes cut, large company's investing money back in the USA. Possible speaking terms with NK. Not too bad for one year in office. More then what Obumma did in 8 years. Now to get the Dems out of office in Connecticut.

581 2018-03-14 20:13:23 They are protesting the ease and speed of gun ownership. There is no real way a thorough background check can be completed and there is the gun show/private sale loophole. They are also protesting the “need” of an 18 - 21 yr old to own an AR 15 and bump stocks 1/
582 2018-03-14 20:12:58 Is it similar for Avaiation stocks?

Your “good news” should have read, 

“By a vote of 417 to ZERO, the House just banned Assault Weapons and Bump Stocks.  Effective immediately.”

Reads a whole lot better.

591 2018-03-14 20:08:02 You’re wrong sadsafrass Mass shooting are done with assault weapons, AR-15, bump stocks... so, you’re wrong Sassafrass
592 2018-03-14 20:07:42 Do they come with Bump Stocks, 100 round magazines, and Cop Killer Armor Piercing bullets as well?
593 2018-03-14 20:07:30 I actually struggle with how best to invest a lump-sum of cash. Statistically, the best option is to invest it all now since stocks generally rise. But emotionally, dollar cost averaging is easier to stomach and reduces the risk of picking the wrong day to invest it all.
594 2018-03-14 20:07:10 #stocks  Your best strategy as a conservative investor is take stocks off the table, raise cash, and start looking for battered high quality DOW stocks and proven dividend payersl, but not HIGH YIELD stock or stock funds. You want companies paying 2 to 5% and not much more..
595 2018-03-14 20:06:42 Compares an AR15 with a BB gun but is probably the first guy to point out an AR15 isn't an assault rifle, while simultaneously ignoring bump stocks exist. You are rooting for school shootings in a moronic way, my dude.
596 2018-03-14 20:06:36 There is no reason a civilian needs an AR-15. There's no reason bump stocks should be legal. The 2nd amendment proponents conveniently forget the phrase  "well regulated." Keep your handgun, have a shotgun to go hunting, with proper training and after passing background check.

598 2018-03-14 20:05:46 There are many closed for entrance cities in Russia. There is absolutely no any possibility to check their words and declared stocks
599 2018-03-14 20:05:25 You know what would really protect our schools? BANNING AR15 TYPE WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL ALLOW A GUN TO FIRE RAPIDLY AND INDISCRIMINATELY.

603 2018-03-14 20:04:00 That’s definitely a fact but then it’d just be an EXTRA $500 bucks a day.  I’m sure I could use that to play with stocks or start a small business or even fund my education for the traits I acquire.

606 2018-03-14 20:03:19 A protest that doesn’t even have any clearly articulated goal. What is it that they want, exactly? “Safety”? No one can guarantee safety. How do they think that safety will be provided to them? By a ban on guns? By raising the age to 21? By banning bump stocks? Get real.
607 2018-03-14 20:03:11 Is there a ban on bump stocks? How about on high capacity magazines? Universal background checks?  Did you close the gun show loophole? Or ban private sales without a universal background check? Did you repeal the Dickey amendment? No?  What a surprise! #NRABloodMoney
608 2018-03-14 20:01:51 can we just get REAL BACKGROUND CHECKS and no long non just basic hunting rifles until 21? No Bump stocks. That seems simple to start from, close the open air guns loop hole and no crossing state lines with Federal mandates to keep gun laws uniform within States to save lives etc
609 2018-03-14 20:01:49 @DavidTurley4 @BarackObama  could not reach across the isle and come up that bipartisan gun laws. decreasing clip sizes? bump stocks? these are things that Trump is trying to get the republicans to understand, but most of them are bought by the NRA. Trump is going to do something
610 2018-03-14 20:01:25 Putin said his stocks were destroyed & witnessed by international observers. They also asked for samples which he is entitled to. So what happens when he tests it & it's not Russian? I remember Blair's WMD, but the Gov said it has "proof", so they had better be correct on this!
611 2018-03-14 20:01:18 Maybe this isn’t “Republicanish” but idc. Why can’t Trump deactivate, tell world, stocks plunge...message sent. . I just checked my impressions. Now I’m down to 10. Every one. From 100’s
612 2018-03-14 20:01:06 3 months sober, my stocks looking great, got a promotion, and bank account looking A1  Damn life is good!
613 2018-03-14 20:00:40 Anyone know if killmonger target exlcsuive ever gets re stocks?
614 2018-03-14 20:00:30 Read the article. She doesn't have that kind of money and her stocks are practically worthless at this time.
615 2018-03-14 20:00:11 PM is going to call for a ban on imported Russian vodka once they are sure that the bars in WM have sufficient stocks.
616 2018-03-14 19:59:50 You need a new PR Firm. You dipshits just don’t get it do you. Don’t want to take away guns just want you to control your house, lobbying efforts, gun shows, bump stocks etc.  we don’t want to give people more guns just want the right people to own them #Clueless #GunReformNow
617 2018-03-14 19:59:33 Composing a love ballad to low float stocks!! Gonna go platinum in 2018 baby!!!
618 2018-03-14 19:59:28 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
619 2018-03-14 19:59:27 Some black dude that plays guitar and stocks
620 2018-03-14 19:59:14 @GOP you control all 3 branches of govt. You could pass universal background checks, ban bump stocks, and raise the buying age tomorrow. You would be heroes to millions of kids who will soon vote. Only ones disappointed will be NRA, Fox News, abusers, & gun mfrs. #NeverAgainMSD
621 2018-03-14 19:58:55 But let me guess how you're going to move the goal-posts now - "Well did they ACTUALLY FIND IT in his hotel room?"

WHAT DOES IT MATTER? If he didn't use it it means that he got enough automatic use out of semi-automatic weapons outfitted with bump-stocks

So he didn't need it
622 2018-03-14 19:58:52 I really believe there is a match between certain stocks and you. As long as you don't force trades, you usually come up win.
623 2018-03-14 19:57:45 $DPW Still kicking STRONG with all other crypto stocks going down today.
624 2018-03-14 19:57:45 $KCPC $2.65 + 400% nice run on the Appointment of John McAfee as Senior Strategic Advisor! but why keycapitalgroup $KCPC  issue this PR not CryptoSecure? SMH I guess they want the credit to go to their stock lol
625 2018-03-14 19:57:34 I’m sure 99% of it is political posturing but Trump’s on here talking about banning bump stocks, raising the age requirement of buying a gun, confiscate first, ask questions later, etc. These Parkland kids should be stroking his ego, not hanging up on phone calls from him
626 2018-03-14 19:57:26 Because I do not option trade. I buy and hold stocks for their dividends.
627 2018-03-14 19:57:12 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks, there needs to be no loopholes in universal background checks. Lastly no teacher I know wants the responsibility of having a gun in their classroom.
628 2018-03-14 19:56:45 @bobbyscar Could I get your opinion on something? If Character's percentage carried over during a crew battle along with stocks, how drastic would this change the Meta of Crew Battles?
629 2018-03-14 19:56:44 finally got my money out them stocks 
630 2018-03-14 19:56:07 Cant teach me - sorry - Stocks make everything unreliable - maybe 2-10-12 would hit target - by target I mean a large garden shed
631 2018-03-14 19:56:00 I agree that culture could fix/change alot. But violence will never end, so just because we can't end it, doesn't mean we should give up on making things safer. The gov shouldn't, and won't go confiscate guns, but banning bump stocks, and having background checks wont hurt anyone
632 2018-03-14 19:55:57 Hi Paul. Yes, our Towcester branch stocks this. If you have any trouble finding it please give one of our Partners the line number which is 710235. Thanks
633 2018-03-14 19:55:53 And I really think this quote by Kudlow sums it all up (for the entirety of the GOP) ...

645 2018-03-14 19:52:48 @NicolaSturgeon @AST_Salmon when is the govt going to clamp down on salmon farms and the devastation caused to wild stocks and sea trout on the west coast. If the public knew half of what’s going on they wouldn’t touch the stuff!
646 2018-03-14 19:52:25 They are a sea bird that have been forced inland due to commercial fishing. As a result of this imbalance they are now causing a threat to native freshwater fish they predate on, cause and effect. To maintain those fish stocks they must be controlled.

649 2018-03-14 19:51:36 Modern symbiotic relationship. say stocks became like cryptos & $$ then they fall under the purvue of the cftc as well. As it stands each regulator defines the instruments respectively. We have a new instrument. IMO smartest crypto minds should self regulate using cryptoplatforms

-Constantly updating live quotes for a list of stocks
-Graphs with volume and easily toggleable time frames (all while still seeing the live quotes)

665 2018-03-14 19:46:54 Thank god they didn't seize the bump-stocks from the illegals hiding out in Sanctuary cities.
666 2018-03-14 19:46:49 #stocks  More conservative investors should remain in a good cash position to take advantage of some real bargains coming as Trump's rosy scenario stock market crumbles. Buy blue chips on dips and don't resort to options trading.

669 2018-03-14 19:46:07 Like, the background checks system fix would be a good thing, bump stocks can go, Stop School Violence Act should pass. I wish the whole activist crew would team up with the NRA crowd (maybe make it a condition that they stop being so pro sales).
It would be a great team.

673 2018-03-14 19:45:50 That's all well and good.  Do you feel any of you need military assault style weapons with high capacity magazines and bump stocks?  All we're saying is some weapons and accessories are inappropriate for public use. The NRA only cares about profits for gun mfrs.

683 2018-03-14 19:42:56 I would like to know-1) What countries apart from Russia hold stocks of this nerve agent? 2) How did Porton Down identify it, if they don't have any? 3) If the composition is known, why can't any country with nerve agent facilities make it? 4) Why is nobody asking these questions

#1 raise age requirement to 21
#2 Ban assault weapons
#3 Ban bump stocks
Need only to legislate 
Can take effect immediately

691 2018-03-14 19:39:31 Buy it while stocks last 
692 2018-03-14 19:39:28 It’s not proprietary. Its components were published in the 1980s and Porton Down must have synthesised it to be able to test for it. There is no evidence that Russia have any stocks - the whole point of this stuff is supposed to be that it doesn’t need to be stockpiled.
693 2018-03-14 19:39:20 Russia should be more honest. They should say it wasn’t them but that some of their ‘stocks’ have gone missing. But they won’t admit that - They’d rather we believed it was them than admit they’ve lost control of it! Like TM said, they are playing games and being disrespectful!

695 2018-03-14 19:37:38 Yes

AR-15s are used for hunting

Not opposed to bump stocks being banned, as the #NRA points out.

There should be penalties for:
Failure to update background check databases
Law enforcement not taking warnings serious
(Supervisory position especially)

698 2018-03-14 19:35:54 I completely agree. I, personally, don't support bump stocks. And most modifications are illegal... which I'm also ok with.

705 2018-03-14 19:33:48 Now, pass gun laws to stop  the sale of bump stocks, assault rifles.  We have too many guns in this country. If this happened to your child you would pass the laws quickly.  Stop all the gun violence. We are the laughing stock of the world.
706 2018-03-14 19:33:41 Universal background checks. Ban assault-style weapons. Outlaw bump stocks. Limit magazine capacity to 10 rounds. End NRA lobbying and money. This is what we demand. If you can’t do it, we’ll find someone who can. #PA18

759 2018-03-14 19:20:30 How about ban automatic rifles? Bump Stocks? Better background checks?  This new act does nothing new.  Can't wait for November #BlueWave2018 You are history, along with your GOP buddies.

764 2018-03-14 19:19:52 They can't purchase it fully automatic off the shelf, but thanks to the bump stocks they can purchase a semi-automatic and an attachment that effectively makes it fully automatic.  Most of the restrictions currently in place have loopholes you can drive a truck through.

766 2018-03-14 19:19:38 Raising the age wouldnt work since most of the shooters have been over 21, only the Vegas shooter used bump stocks, shootings happen in states that require registration,and background checks,removing the Dickey Amendment would waste money on promoting gun control that doesnt work

768 2018-03-14 19:18:34 @RickSantorum @CNNPolitics Rick, you are wrong. Changing the gun  laws incrementally by banning AR rifles, increased background checks, no bump stocks and hi capacity magazines MAY help keep kids safe. We don’t know because Congress has not done anything. #worstcongressever

800 2018-03-14 19:08:00 I'm honestly not even against the banning of bump stocks. They don't serve a necessary purpose. I question some people's concept of what merits "high-capacity" though. But people seem incapable, overall, with having a rational discussion about a complicated issue.
801 2018-03-14 19:07:51 I support thorough background checks, necessary gun training, and a full ban on bump stocks. I also support special protocol for assault rifles.
802 2018-03-14 19:07:51 Agreed, but they don't always "crash" -- lots of markets, just go dead for years... just like certain stocks do sometimes

Clearly another Trump pal placeholder. Absurd. Pull your money from stocks,away from Wall Street.
806 2018-03-14 19:06:20 Self defense with a gun is fine. Hunting is fine. Sporting is fine

Assault weapons are not fine. Bump stocks are not fine. These two kill many more people than they save

Why are we against stricter background checks or registration so we can solve more crimes, limit killings
807 2018-03-14 19:06:06 $RKDA $50, what an epic squeeze.  So disappointed that I sold under $10.  Another lesson learned:  Got to hold those beaten down low floater reverse split stocks a little longer and be more patient with them.
808 2018-03-14 19:05:42 Trump could well preside over the death of trickle-down. When stocks get hammered & a socialist beats him in 2020. The socialist probably won't continue to led the Fed blow up bubbles that most don't benefit from. Stocks could take 15-20years to get back to highs.

823 2018-03-14 19:00:36 A number of things should happen that are reasonable. To list a few...
• Raise age to purchase assault rifles to 21
• Ban bump stocks
• Expanding background checks 
• Repealing Dickey Amendment 
• Gun registration

826 2018-03-14 18:59:03 I agree, including mental health checks. i also think there should be regular renewals of a gun license that includes mental health checks by a professional bc some issues develop later on. i was thinking mostly ARs & bump stocks.

833 2018-03-14 18:56:43 Then ban bump stocks, but you can't ban a weapon that is semi-automatic. So, your first statement was ignorant. I really wish u non gun owners knew about this before you speak.

Im not too proud of a man to admit what I dont know because it only helps you grow, who on here knows how to properly invest in stocks or crypto curreny because Im trying to gain some capital. All help is appreciated and if you talk shit go fuck yourself 
869 2018-03-14 18:45:02 With shifting strategies to a more conservative portfolio, I'm getting a better understanding of how difficult it is (actually almost impossible) to time the market.  Even rock solid picks might not move up in a straight line. Gotta believe in what you buy. #investing #stocks

871 2018-03-14 18:44:17 Correct me if I am wrong but as far as I am aware, the OPCW concluded that sarin or a sarin-like substance had been used in Khan Sheikhoun.  The media conclusion was that Assad was behind it.  Re Novichok, the OPCW verified the destruction of all stocks.

884 2018-03-14 18:37:34 @realDonaldTrump FYI: 3 trained teachers accidentally fired weapons in schools this week. Don't let the NRA bully you. Find a way to raise age limits, ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, & close gun show loopholes. These are requests supported by the majority.

889 2018-03-14 18:36:57 These guns also often have detachable magazines.  And bump stocks should also be banned.  Typically used in many/ most mass murders in America. if you are not sure, you can look it up.
890 2018-03-14 18:36:53 Most people from the left just want to make it a little harder for people to get guns that for sure damn sure should never have access to them not an outright ban. The only bans people really want are to AR-15s and bump stocks.
891 2018-03-14 18:36:18 How many more restrictions can we place that hasn't already been implimented? Are regulating or banning bump stocks, high capacity mags ect going to make a gun/rifle less deadly? Stop guns from getting in the hands of that FL shooter? What good is changing the legal purchase age
892 2018-03-14 18:35:04 When stocks are rising, #ValueTrading should be used to gain value. When stocks are falling, #GrowthTrading should be used to increase portfolio size. Unfortunately, most people only use the first style and know nothing about the second. Fear takes over on down trends.
893 2018-03-14 18:34:24 AR-15s are totally unnecessary for hunting. Bump stocks? Same thing.

*doubtless all will now go up +/or be taken over...
896 2018-03-14 18:32:59 Paul, Did you ban bump stocks? Did you ban ARs? Did you ban large capacity magazines? Did you require background checks on ALL gun applicants? Did you create experts groups to assess actual issue around poor gun laws? Or did you put more guns in our communities?

905 2018-03-14 18:31:09 What is #GrowthTrading in the markets? It is a trading style to generate growth in a portfolio. Stocks that you own get sold on a downtrend and bought back at a lower price. The money saved from loss is then used to buy more shares of the same stock. Used for long term holdings.

Are you against smaller magazines? 
Are you against banning bump stocks? 
Are you against a 5 day waiting period?

913 2018-03-14 18:28:34 Toasting is one way. Another is to saute the rice with seasoning, onions, and/or herbs for infused goodness. Stocks/broths in lieu of water can also add depth and flavor. Butter and oil during boiling creates softer and fluffier rice.

921 2018-03-14 18:25:57 Almost 4 decades of mass shootings, deadlier weapons every day (weapons of war + bump stocks = mass destruction), access getting easier, traumatized daily by news of more shootings and active shooter drills.

946 2018-03-14 18:20:11 Don't get me wrong, I'm pro gun. I believe its necessary for people to be allowed to keep 2nd Amendment. I do think, however, that bump stocks need to be banned, and background checks stricter in some instances, but people should be allowed to own weapons in general.
947 2018-03-14 18:18:38 This is why No prep Drag racing is so popular, it’s time the pro stocks go turbo. Makes for Better racing
948 2018-03-14 18:18:09 I have shot weapons before, and I completely understand how recoil works. Bump-stocks allow for a faster fire rate with minimal effort, and can essentially can turn a semi-auto weapon into an automatic weapon.
949 2018-03-14 18:18:06 So the "fast and furious" wasn't true? Mental health not in ACA isn't true?, what about Obama's administration saying bump stocks weren't a threat, he had 8 years to do something with the gun laws and failed

956 2018-03-14 18:16:08 It's not a hunting rifle either. It's built to kill humans, and nothing else.

Also, a bump stock makes it an assault rifle, and those are legal and cheap. Why is the NRA fighting against banning bump stocks?

961 2018-03-14 18:14:51 This fraud legislation addresses none of the issues in the present arena.  This is only a front by republicans for more guns.  No more machine gun type weapons (that's why bump stocks exist) is beyond them.  They seem to prefer massacres and payoffs and thoughts and prayers.

973 2018-03-14 18:11:58 There is pretty much one argument for gun control that I support, and that is the banning of bump-stocks. I currently preside in Illinois, where our gun control laws are stricter than up north, say in Wisconsin. I think the issue is a people problem, not a gun problem.
974 2018-03-14 18:11:50 I looked good today, only thing that was kinda holding me back was my dead-ish trim ... but i still looked good. Oh yea.. i can now say I’ve pitched stocks for a Managed Fund now 
975 2018-03-14 18:10:59 It isn't made anywhere but Russia. (In fact is was in the USSR but they still have stocks and the ability)
976 2018-03-14 18:09:53 The opcw is fair convinced the Russians destroyed their CW stocks. Ukraine, on the other hand, may well still have stocks of nerve agents. Not to mention the near certainty that the nerve agent was reverse developed in other counties, to test lethality and develop defence.
977 2018-03-14 18:09:35 You're mistaken.  Buying stocks now would be purchasing them from people who bet on buybacks.  That ship sailed.
978 2018-03-14 18:09:25 It has three stocks about 1/2 inch across.  Starting to show little green shoots.  Can't plant outdoors since ground is still frozen and have a little snow yet.  Keeping it cool on floor for now w/morning sun.
979 2018-03-14 18:08:51 It does not to have to always turn out fine. Many stocks have gone to under 1 or zero in these situations. $RAD mgt is clearly inept and still keeps jobs, that is absurd. Called crony capitalism which virtually never rewards s'holders.
980 2018-03-14 18:08:43 Also, stocks have intrinsic value in that they are both income generating & provide ownership of the means of production (capital). The value of BTC =/= the value of blockchain tech. The current bubble is another in a long string of well documented bubbles over several centuries.
981 2018-03-14 18:08:43 21 with background check on every purchase. Training required. M/O ban semiautomatics, modifiers, bump stocks to general public.
982 2018-03-14 18:08:38 Mixed feelings on the kids walking out but there needs to be change.  What’s being asked is not unreasonable ant quite frankly if Trump was such the leader he claims he could have just signed a bill banning assault rifles, bump stocks and extensive background checks.  Stay safe
983 2018-03-14 18:08:12 Ban bump stocks. No accessories that can modify a semiautomatic firearm to go full auto. The general populace does *not* have the constitutional right to bear whatever it wants. No man-portable nukes. No VX. No Miniguns. No automatic weapons.
984 2018-03-14 18:08:12 I could do this for hours, John, but I think you get the point. The fact is that EVERYONE in the middle wants universal background checks, an end to loopholes, an end to bump stocks, etc. You do, and I do.
985 2018-03-14 18:08:01 I call bullshit!
Gun control. Ban assault type weapons, ammo and bump stocks.
Increase age to buy, waiting period and universal background checks. Ban those on No Fly list from buying guns.

991 2018-03-14 18:05:56 Larry Kudlow is one of the worst economic pundits ever. Keep telling people to buy stocks in 2007 and 2008. Stocks dropped 80% if you followed that moron's advice.
992 2018-03-14 18:05:32 AR-15s do far less damage than many other guns available. Would you ban those too? What do bump stocks do to make them more dangerous? The beginning? What else do you propose?

996 2018-03-14 18:04:06 I heard a nasty rumor that people are sometimes emotional about stocks.
997 2018-03-14 18:03:56 Limit it to sane people with massive amounts of gun training and safety.  Get rid of AR-15s. More background checks.  Get rid of bump stocks.  That is just the beginning.
998 2018-03-14 18:03:45 What did Obama do? After Sandy Hook he stood up there with tears in his eyes and did NOTHING. Oh wait he passed legislation that allowed bump stocks!
999 2018-03-14 18:03:23 Who said anything about disarming everyone, or making all guns illegal ? We are talking about common sense gun control. Universal background checks. Bans on bump stocks. Registration and licensing.

1001 2018-03-14 18:02:42 Raoul: bump stocks and trigger cranks should be kept out of the hands of those who would do harm. It isn't just these items though, it's handguns that are trafficked: referring to the governor's veto of gun dealer licensing.

1003 2018-03-14 18:01:33 Much as the lunatic right wing keeps insisting, we don't want to ban all guns. We want universal background checks and an end to the gun show loophole. We also want to ban high clip mags, bump stocks and the like along with kevlar piercing bullets. There's no need for them.

1006 2018-03-14 17:58:54 AR-15s and Bump Stocks did NOT exist when the 2nd Amendment was written.  If they did, I can honestly say that amendment would not exist as it is today.  

Words and their meanings need to be modified and adjusted for the time we live in now.

1028 2018-03-14 17:50:52 Did the Vegas shooter need dozens of high powered semi automatic weapons and bump stocks to defend his property and family? Do you see how absurd this argument is? It’s like saying you need an F1 race car because you have a long commute.

1109 2018-03-14 17:21:07 Is this perhaps for stock manipulation? If you can present enough of a facade that you impact publicly traded stocks & then buy during the dip you create you might be able to reap a profit on the surge side of Intel stock and the recovery sick of AMD. Just speculation.
1110 2018-03-14 17:20:58 Other than a bump stock everything else is ILLEGAL. Also with numb stocks it makes the gun your shooting very hard to control and not accurate at all. Plus aren’t lawmakers working on outlawing bump stocks I’m talking lawmakers on both sides
1111 2018-03-14 17:20:57 What a difference 2 days make......stocks way down today as your name comes up to replace Cohn in the administration of IQ45. Remember, Larry, everything trump touches dies. Credit to @TheRickWilson .

1118 2018-03-14 17:18:12 Lack of action has brought us to this point.  Why are bump stocks legal?  Why is the NRA (or ANY special interest group) allowed to give money to politicians, when the politicians should be representing their constituents?  Trump caved to the NRA...millennials will vote
1119 2018-03-14 17:18:07 Who does have stocks of it outside Russia?
1120 2018-03-14 17:17:27 You probably left out crucial components: 1) Ban all assault style semi-automatic weapons, 2) bump stocks, 3) high capacity magazines, and 4) broaden background checks for all purchases of fire arms including gun show sales. Immediately!
1121 2018-03-14 17:17:17 Double standard. He was too smart for his own good, and was deemed a threat. Right before he went to jail he started a YouTube series, analyzing stocks, showing his complete portfolio, every week, many of his predictions (including Axovant’s impending tumble) turning out true.
1122 2018-03-14 17:16:59 "King Dollar!" might not be so hot for my foreign commodity stocks like VALE
1123 2018-03-14 17:16:58 Arming teachers is NOT THE ANSWER. Sensible gun reform is: ban assault weapons, bump stocks, stricter background checks, waiting periods, 21, close ALL loopholes. Spend $$ on providing certified psychologist in EVERY SCHOOL.
1124 2018-03-14 17:16:53 AI could play a role in detecting unusual buying patterns, eg Las Vegas shooter buying 30 guns, thousands of rounds, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. But sales are not tracked & background check info is not kept. NRA opposes any tracking or registration.
1125 2018-03-14 17:16:48 You're being naive here. This nerve agent was uniquely produced by the Russians! Proudly! They said they destroyed all stocks, obviously not! Fundamental difference between assassinations  and T Shirts. Don't forget, Putin declared foreign assassinations as legal on foreign soil
1126 2018-03-14 17:16:41 Banning bump stocks, increasing waiting/cool off periods, insisting on use training and insurance.  Lots of things that don't interfere with 2 A if you weren't groveling to @NRA bribery.

1144 2018-03-14 17:12:49 What an absurd response.
Please explain why semi-automatic weapons (with bump stocks) are a-okay, but bazookas, rocket launchers, and machine guns are illegal? Based on the NRA's insane rhetoric Americans have a civil right to ANY weapon they want in order to protect themselves.
1145 2018-03-14 17:12:23 What about bump stocks? Who needs those? What about mentally unstables having access to guns?
1146 2018-03-14 17:12:07 The children can see how stupid it is to allow free access to semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Learn from your children!
1147 2018-03-14 17:12:06 They do not promote pure unadulterated gun rights the way freedom was designed. They supported banning bump stocks. Last time I looked the words banning and freedom were not the same.
1148 2018-03-14 17:11:50 I will stand with the NRA & not kids on this. The NRA does not sell guns, they teach people how to use them properly. That picture...that's not an automatic, it's a semi-automatic & shoots only as many times as the trigger is pulled. I can see bump stocks outlawed with no problem

1162 2018-03-14 17:07:36 It’s National Walkout Day. I guess they want to wait until the iron is nice and cold, before a mass demonstration. The public moved on. The news moved on. Good luck even discussing bump stocks now. Ya blew it.

1165 2018-03-14 17:05:58 But the NRA does support tyranny. The supported banning bump stocks. That is not on the side of freedom.
1166 2018-03-14 17:05:38 Me personally?  Age restriction on some guns like we have for alcohol and voting.  Ban of bump stocks, ban of magazines over 10, domestic violence and mental health restrictions for purchases.

1180 2018-03-14 17:01:05 The solution is simple.  As we’ve been told, laws work.  All we have to do is pass a law that specifically bans people from using a semi automatic weapon to kill another person.  Add bump stocks & full auto too.  Problem solved.  Just like with drugs.

1191 2018-03-14 16:58:00 The @NRA has repeatedly supported a ban on bump stocks and has also fought for the federal government and states to legally require the reporting of felons to the NICS database so they can be classified as prohibited Possessors.

1225 2018-03-14 16:43:06 It does not matter which asset class, neither the direction. You don't want to make predictions, you want to follow the money. #tradebehaviour #quant #algo #stocks #indices $ES_F $SPY #BTC $DAX_F $XAU #trading
1226 2018-03-14 16:42:36 Ou d anciens stocks n auraient pas pu etre volés  en particulier pendant l époque sovietique ou ds les periodes difficiles ceux qui pouvaient vendaient n importe quoi...
1227 2018-03-14 16:42:34 Illinois Senate passes HB1467 in a 37-16 vote. That bill bans bump stocks in the state.
1228 2018-03-14 16:41:43 It doesn't matter where a stock has been.. it doesn't matter if you lost your ass, it doesn't matter if you made a mill

What matters is where stocks are going!  It's a rotation, I better get used to it, or i will be lost in the fray.
1229 2018-03-14 16:41:03 I have followed the Banking Index ETF for a while as a leading indication of what stocks might do going forward. You should check it out. Look at where is 2-3 weeks or months and where the US stock indices are and what follows.
1230 2018-03-14 16:41:00 If the second amendment comes without restrictions, then why don’t private citizens have fully automatic weapons or RPGs?

Hunters do not need assault rifles, or bump stocks, or high capacity magazines, or armor-piercing rounds, or to buy guns without background checks.
1231 2018-03-14 16:40:56 HB-1467 the local gun ban and bump stocks passed 37-16--3

1233 2018-03-14 16:40:36 Yup. This is why Obama was good for gun stocks. I never realized how deep the undercurrent of racism still runs in this country.
1234 2018-03-14 16:40:34 I’ve tried to buy a certain micro cap stock now for 3 week without success. I see that people try to get me to increase the price by offering a few stocks just a bit higher..... all the time.
Very frustrating! For some reason I can’t see more than the highest bidder. Ideas?
1235 2018-03-14 16:40:33 Keeping all good stocks to yourself!

1244 2018-03-14 16:38:45 I agree...but the powers that be don’t want to ban bump stocks, or assault rifles. As a civilian, why would one need either.
1245 2018-03-14 16:38:40 Some people are just lazy slobs. Leaving litter on beach or elsewhere matters not one iota to them. Bring back the stocks. Strap them in there and we can throw rotten tomatoes at them.
1246 2018-03-14 16:37:49 Issue with these stocks is they need news to  create buyers. It's not sustainable! Need results and $$$$!!
1247 2018-03-14 16:37:47 Democrats don't have "an agenda to disarm the nation." We have an agenda to help keep people safe & reduce senseless deaths by gun violence. Law abiding gun owners aren't going to have all their guns taken away.
Ban bump stocks
Raise purchase age to 21
Stricter background checks
1248 2018-03-14 16:37:29 I am right thanks. Nerve agents degrade..fact. The answer, they were made where Porton Down said they were made, it was a soviet designed nerve agent not made by anyone else and contrary to international law. Unless Russia admit that they have lost stocks the guilt is with them.
1249 2018-03-14 16:37:27 If you are not a felon,  sane, 21 to purchase military style rifle,pass the Mandatory background checks at all points of sale,figure in the 5 day waiting period to purchace a gun with a magazine of 10 or less rounds, with no bump stocks or other items that will modify said gun
1250 2018-03-14 16:37:15 Yo es que también pienso que Puff tiene un punto a favor importante sobre Kirby, y es como counterpick, MVL, Fatality y otros jugadores lo has usado como counterpick para ciertas situaciones, ya que con solo dos stocks en este juego, es relativamente viable colar dos rests y win.
1251 2018-03-14 16:35:43 Haha ya . Sometimes I am in just to many stocks and stay focused on others I just forget sometimes to be honest . Other times I just look at the long term picture . $ime is cheap just saying 
1252 2018-03-14 16:35:08 Ironic part is that the NRA doesn't care about bump stocks. It's an accessory. One of many.

We need to take out semi autos and extended high cal ammo clips or it's just more token gestures.
1253 2018-03-14 16:34:07 Senate begins debate on first of a trio of gun bills. HB1467 would ban the sale of bump stocks and trigger cranks. #twill

1256 2018-03-14 16:33:17 First of all no one should be owning an AR 15 or bump stocks and second young people should be supervised with weapons because their minds are not fully developed and accidents happen with firearms all the time not to mention people killing for other reasons
1257 2018-03-14 16:33:03 The Illinois Senate is taking up various gun control bills, first up is a bill to ban bump stocks. It has been amended to allow home rule governments to regulate assault weapons.
1258 2018-03-14 16:32:46 Lol, stock was 195 in early January, and 320 now.  I wish ALL my stocks would tank this badly

1260 2018-03-14 16:32:35 Senate beginning to take up gun control bills. First up is a ban on bump stocks and local regulation of assault weapons.
1261 2018-03-14 16:32:12 This has been a long time coming. I could never understand why $FB and $AAPL were classified as technology stocks. Indices and their classifications should change with the times as businesses morph.
1262 2018-03-14 16:31:35 Senate lawmakers are back on the floor. Now taking up various gun control bills, first up is a bill to ban bump stocks. It was amended to allow home rule governments to regulate assault weapons.

1274 2018-03-14 16:29:26 OK, so stocks declined dramatically right after President #Trump again pointed out unfair trade practices against #America.  Are the Wall street globalists so wicked that they prefer the #USA being screwed over?  What say you?
1275 2018-03-14 16:29:20 This man is ignoring the fact that Russia sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons  on their Destruction in 1997. Russia has since destroyed all left over stocks from the Soviet Union chemical weapon program.
1276 2018-03-14 16:28:22 We cannot keep a blind eye to rampant unfair gun selling practices in our Country! Ban bumps stocks. Ban military style weapons, limit magazine purchases. Stricter background checks. Raise the age for purchase to 21. Stand up to the NRA or YOU are the coward.

1279 2018-03-14 16:27:27 @UBS So, the speed of #Fed tightening still looks  unlikely to exceed one rate rise per quarter this year. So we believe  the 10-year US Treasury is attractive versus cash. And a gradualist Fed  is also positive for global stocks. #FOMC #interestrates #USeconomy #forex #fx

1295 2018-03-14 16:21:08 "In stocks, it's the only place where, when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonald's ( MCD ) reduces the price of hamburgers, I think it's great."  - Charlie Munger

1306 2018-03-14 16:19:22 Thanks VOX,
But no, we will never meet eroupeon control levels.
We will have to settle for storage and carry requirements.
We can ban the sale of assult rifles and Bump Stocks and offer buy back plans.
Don't inflame the 2nd ammendmenters with
 "We need to take away guns"

1319 2018-03-14 16:15:16 It was manufactured in Uzbekistan back in the Soviet era, in fact. 
Uzbekistan is not Russia. It's another country. 
Stocks weren't properly accounted for either in the chaos of Soviet breakup. 
Some Novichok stocks may have been sold for cash.
Too easy to just say Putin did it.
1320 2018-03-14 16:15:07 don't you think this cash comes to bond for protection and is park on the notes it generates, so thats the reason stocks price decrease for same cash go back to the market?
1321 2018-03-14 16:14:20 I agree with you except don’t tell me bump stocks aren’t but just a little slower than automatic. That’s just not a truthful depiction and as gun owners we both know that.
1322 2018-03-14 16:14:03 yeah, I trade some OTC, mostly sell option premium on high flyer big board stocks. The only thing I am holding as an "investment" is $AMLH. That's the only thing I believe in going forward. Once the CEO get's it together, it's going to be a good company, especially at this PPS.
1323 2018-03-14 16:13:43 Essentially no concealed in NJ, N.Y. or CA. Don't care about bump stocks, never did. All bullets cause trauma, hollow points are a better SD round, FMJs for the range and water jugs. Shotgun is a great home gun for some, but not all. Great if that's good for you.

1329 2018-03-14 16:11:41 Nope. Still all-in and loving the returns. Fortunately I'm smart enough to realize that presidents have very little short term effect on stocks and that a nation's "success" isn't defined by the 15-month returns on my investments.
1330 2018-03-14 16:11:11 Since I'm doing the 2 jobs thing to build up trading capital I can only watch 1-3 stocks a week. This is actually helping me choose the ones I think will perform the best... Pressure creates diamonds.

1339 2018-03-14 16:09:29 @NRA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP  “The shooter at our school obtained weapons he used on us legally. Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain semiautomatic weapons and the modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic, like bump stocks?” González asked.
1340 2018-03-14 16:09:16 That wouldn’t make sense to sell your stocks to lock up your cash for 10 years @2.8%. It’s the fed buying up bonds so stocks don’t sell off, but it’s not working.
1341 2018-03-14 16:09:11 Let’s get the right laws on the books. Outlawing bump stocks would be a good start.

1349 2018-03-14 16:07:13 I'm all for citizen gun ownership, but we need to do it right. Close the private sale loophole for background checks, upgrade the ATF and NICS databases, ban bump stocks, let the CDC study gun violence, and stop letting a fringe minority set the tone for the gun debate.
1350 2018-03-14 16:06:38 Stocks not happy with tariff talk on Chinese electronics.  That's another reason for bond and note rally, but BE CAREFUL!  If China decides to unload some U.S. Treasuries here, June bonds could REALLY CRASH.  That's what happened when Trump was elected.  Look at that chart!

1360 2018-03-14 16:03:27 You do realize the second amendment didn’t incorporate assault weapons or bump stocks but it did include a well regulated militia which is the national guard. Each state has a national guard to protect that state and its citizens.

1402 2018-03-14 15:50:45 Senator you need to take action. You have sold your soul to the NRA. Proect our children and all citizens of this country. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks, raise the age for buying guns, close loopholes for gun shows! Stop the madness! #Enough

1405 2018-03-14 15:49:47 A ban on bump stocks is an infringement of the Second Amendment. So very disappointed in your attack on the Second Amendment.

1418 2018-03-14 15:45:22 Patience may be rewarded by holding back. USA markets. Dow had been up and is now trending down.

USA stocks listed on the main market are universally expensive. However, foreign stocks listed in USA can often offer growth at a reasonable value particularly Chinese stocks.
1419 2018-03-14 15:45:21 Intelligence services (East and West) are typically in 'permanent war mode' and think assassinations 'acts of war', a mark of how much above the law they all are. Chemical weapon stocks--esp used for such purposes--are tightly controlled due to diplomatic implications, BTW.

Ban semi-automatic weapons
Ban bump stocks
Universal background checks
No guns for domestic violence perps
Take away NRA not-profit status
Fed money for CDC to research gun violence
Law enforcement to report gun incidents
= good start
1442 2018-03-14 15:38:48 Well if we look at things like bump stocks, they were made for one purpose. And if we look at things like AR-15’s then we know they were originally made and designed to sell to the US Army during the Vietnam War.

1471 2018-03-14 15:29:09 Acting ATF head acknowledges he's been told by some attorneys that banning bump stocks through regulation would lead to court challenges that would delay the implementation of a ban. Also says a ban via legislation would be “clearly the best route.”
1472 2018-03-14 15:29:00 But yes, ban bump stocks. That’s the lowest hanging fruit and something that should still be done after the mass shooting in Las Vegas. But universal background checks for all gun purchases needs to happen now.

1474 2018-03-14 15:27:43 & assault -style weapons, ban bump stocks, strengthen background checks, close gun show & private sale loopholes, stop sabotaging the ACA & its provisions that require all insurance plans to cover mental health. There are VERY SPECIFIC things people want & are marching for

1476 2018-03-14 15:26:51 Agreed @JoeyMagz, hence me saying stricter background checks. It’s a much larger issue than just Parkland however. Vegas shooter has no warning signs, His access to bump stocks helped make that shooting the deadliest in American history
1477 2018-03-14 15:26:42 I’ll be owning a percentage of @McDonalds @McDonaldsCorp stocks soon  Also.. planning to franchise one
1478 2018-03-14 15:26:20 SPX odds are slightly higher that it retests 2533 by going lower than 2600 in coming weeks. Higher projections of 2873-2915-2950 are on hold for now. Price action is extremely weak many big stocks have reversed their gains from yesterday eg AMZN, AAPL, BKNG, GOOGL, NFLX etc.etc.
1479 2018-03-14 15:26:16 Corbyn did condemn this attack last week - There is not any good reason not to pass a sample to the Independent Inspectors that confirmed Russia deleted their stocks last year - They can prove if Russian Government were responsible
1480 2018-03-14 15:26:15 BTW, my position is not one of not wanting to do something.  However, other than limiting magazine size and bump stocks, you have to classify all semi-auto the same.  That is every gun produced today except muskets.
1481 2018-03-14 15:26:08 You aren't fooling U.S.
Ban the damn gun! Raise the age. Ban Bump stocks.

1483 2018-03-14 15:25:51 Hanging your hat on an NRA backed solution to add guns to schools without raising the age to 21, banning bump stocks, improving background checks and help to fund mental illness only sells more guns and sells us out. Help us win. Thats why you are there Paul.

1500 2018-03-14 15:21:50 Stocks are antiquated. The rules that work for stocks need to be revisited because the volatility in crypto is quite unpredictable
1501 2018-03-14 15:21:47 They already passed in Florida the buying of guns to 21 y. And bump stocks to convert into automatic firing. But the objective here is the push of confiscation of guns don’t make no mistake about it ! This is all organized by the lefties rats !

1510 2018-03-14 15:17:58 Here is how to improve the situation in the US......

Introduce extensive training for all gun owners

Ban bump stocks

Confiscate weapons from all felons and those who are found mentally unfit to possess a firearm.

Protect schools the same way we protect banks.

1531 2018-03-14 15:10:19 I think they mostly want sensible gun laws. Like not allowing anyone under 21 to buy a gun, eliminating bump stocks, etc. Not a total elimination of the amendment, but a revised one with safer regulations
1532 2018-03-14 15:10:17 Investors willing to diversify their source of risk are much better off quitting their PASSIVE longs SPX NQ, moving somewhere else to increase diversification (i.e. reducing idiosincratic risk and increasing market risk) or building their own ACTIVE single stocks portfolio 2/2
1533 2018-03-14 15:09:58 Like you said it's so restrictive to get one hasn't been the issue like certain types of weapons.. Mag capacity.. firing rate.. bump stocks etc..  Don't see a lot of opposition to banning those altogether

1553 2018-03-14 15:02:48 And frankly, I'm seriously getting tired of making that argument. Nobody but the stupid NRA is talking about people taking guns.

We're talking age requirements, waiting periods, and restricting SALES of AR-15s, bump stocks, and high capacity mags. Did you see the word "take"? No
1554 2018-03-14 15:01:27 #Ethanol Data for the week shows production dipping slightly to 1.025 million BPD from 1.057 million BPD previously while stocks grow much more than anticipated to 24.3 million barrels from 23.1 million barrels last week
1555 2018-03-14 15:01:24 Repubs bought & paid for by NRA! Pass sensible gun legislation...Universal background checks, raise min. age to own gun to 25 (just like car rental co.), mandatory gun training, no bump stocks, ban semi automatics, no guns for mentally ill / domestic violence
1556 2018-03-14 15:01:00 Like raising the age limit or banning bump stocks or...What? Arming teachers? Oh. Nevermind.
1557 2018-03-14 15:00:45 Turns out they are all secretly pouring all their money into gun manufacturer stocks.  All this anti-gun protesting is a secret plot to scare people into buying more guns while they still can.   These kids are way smarter than we think!!

1559 2018-03-14 15:00:18 Majority of gun owners are extremely responsible and would follow any laws that make sense - like closing loopholes in gun show and private party sales, banning bump stocks, and waiting periods. You would be happy to abide, correct? No one wants to take your 2nd amendment away
1560 2018-03-14 15:00:08 I suppose there's a chance these are old stocks from Soviet times. Surely the new stuff would have killed?
1561 2018-03-14 14:59:54 Ryan, you will never stand up to the NRA in a meaningful way — banning bump stocks and AR-14/15s, raising the age at which you can get a gun to 21, and closing the gun show loopholes.
1562 2018-03-14 14:59:43 Tragic violence has no place anywhere in our society. The only way to stop it is to ban assault weapons, all high capacity magazines &"bump stocks" & enact strict penalties for anyone who possesses any of these. Enact mandatory background checks for every gun purchase. Act now!
1563 2018-03-14 14:59:20 The NRA makes it easy for EVERYONE to get a gun. 

High-capacity weapons are the choice of mass killers. The NRA doesn't believe in limiting guns to smaller capacities. 

They only grudgingly mumbled something about regulating bump stocks after 1 man killed 58 people injured 851

1571 2018-03-14 14:58:02 1. The NRA supports policy that allows people to buy bump stocks and assault weapons. Therefore, they are part of the problem. 
2. If you think that kids having a political opinion is propaganda, then you obviously don't know anything about politics or freedom of speech.

1577 2018-03-14 14:55:27 You are doing nothing. We had a ban on assault style weapons before in 1984-2004. Why not do it again and add mega magazines,bump stocks,age limit to 21,stricter background regulations and close gun show loopholes. Semper Fi

1584 2018-03-14 14:53:36 A ban on bump-stocks is already in motion and 45-60 rounds can also be achieved with handguns. Rifles are also only used in less than 5% of all murders.

1587 2018-03-14 14:53:06 To remove Bump Stocks is still an infringement on the 2nd Amendment. What part of “Shall not be infringed “ are you people not understanding?

1589 2018-03-14 14:51:51 Before bump stocks were threatened, it was snowflake this snowflake that.  No they want to know why we don’t do enough about bullying...
1590 2018-03-14 14:51:47 Hand guns are just as deadly as Virgina Tech will prove.  If you want to ban ALL guns at least make that argument, banning a specific rifle is just not going to do anything.  I do agree Bump stocks are BS and need to be banned.
1591 2018-03-14 14:51:43 Trend Following is applicable to trading anything, while the other two are geared more towards stocks.
1592 2018-03-14 14:51:23 You guys are horrible at investigations.Too many soft questions & no actions. Ban assault rifles, expand background checks, ban bump stocks, reverse the ban on studying gun violence, 10 day waiting period to buy a weapon.

1595 2018-03-14 14:50:38 Never, ever play stocks like $RKDA on the short side unless you can buy puts. Way too many people are getting blown out on this one. If puts aren't available, play something else. Have to be able to set your max risk

1607 2018-03-14 14:47:47 Ah - so the unavoidable admission that Novichok was indeed the compound, and that Novichok had been a nerve agent developed by the Soviets, tested and stocked in Russia - is pivoted to "...but we stopped making it, and YOU saw we destroyed stocks, so we're innocent..."

1608 2018-03-14 14:47:45 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!

1611 2018-03-14 14:46:49 @SenDeanHeller Hey trump puppet. You think bump stocks are the problem? Not being able to purchase an assault rifle at the age of 18? Keep taking that money from the NRA. No balls! #NoHeller2018
1612 2018-03-14 14:46:19 How about we try it and see what happens.  AR15s and large capacity magazines, bump stocks gone for a couple of years and let’s look at the results.

1622 2018-03-14 14:42:08 We have an automatic weapon ban and that works. We used to have an assault weapons ban. I think keeping bump stocks, silencers, rifle and shotgun magazines at 3.. Maybe 5 round for civilian use needs to return. Particularly for non-game rounds. 5.56s kill humans, not deer.
1623 2018-03-14 14:42:04 Vast majority of them are using their billions of $$ in tax breaks to buy back their own stocks, thus lining their investors' (i.e., richy-rich people) pockets.
1624 2018-03-14 14:42:00 Anxious to get those juicy contracts for your building buddies? How about that executive order to BAN BUMP STOCKS? Did your friends at the NRA talk you out of it? Are you afraid of them?

In January I wanted to buy Mario Odyssey as a 2nd game (Zelda after it) but it was out of stocks..

Bump stocks? Sure, get rid of em'.

If the laws on the books would've been enforced properly, this tragedy could've been avoided. 

That + armed guards (service members in their last year) at schools is the solution, IMO.
1714 2018-03-14 14:13:21 Feinstein Curbelo didn’t pass. There’s a DOJ push 2 include bump stocks in 26 USC 5845(b)’s definition of machine guns. ATF cites this statute 4 why it lacks authority 2 enforce a bump stock ban. IMO, the statute already includes bump stocks, albeit not by name.

1720 2018-03-14 14:10:49 If it doesn't include banning AR-15's, AK-47's, and bump stocks, than it is pointless and worthless.  Do something that has some teeth.  November 6th will be here before you know it. I believe your retirement will be here sooner than you think.

1788 2018-03-14 13:53:13 Exactly. The issue here isn't really pro-gun or anti-gun. It's pro-common sense and anti-common sense. You can be pro-gun in the sense that you're a gun-owner and support an individual right to own a gun, but also pro-common sense gun legislation, like a ban on bump stocks.

1858 2018-03-14 13:21:04 Def. could be? Wonder if they exclude financials? My initial graph did and was skewed by Fannie, Freddie, and big banks. Rerunning now. Obviously, I'm looking at flows, not stocks, since I'm trying to see the relation with repos and cash.
1859 2018-03-14 13:20:42 Why are we banning bump stocks? That’s ridiculous sir. Bump stocks in the hands of LAW ABIDING CITIZENS are never involved in crimes. Why can’t we punish those who break the law instead?

1907 2018-03-14 12:59:41 I agree but there needs to be some common sense applied to exactly who can get a gun. As someone that works with teens and young adults....I really like the idea of raising the age to 21 and eliminating the high capacity magazines and bump stocks.

1954 2018-03-14 12:34:39 There was also weakness in energy stocks as crude oil prices tumbled -1.06%. Stocks found some support on the U.S Feb core CPI report of +1.8% y/y, right on expectations & below the Fed's 2.0% target, which eased concern the Fed may need to speed up the interest rate hikes.

1980 2018-03-14 12:23:57 I agree with age, mental health, disallow bump stocks and training...no checks (think Nazi- Germany). But we have to also demand judges apply maximum sentences, schools lock their doors and remove the “gun-free zone” signs and leave law abiding gun owners alone.
1981 2018-03-14 12:22:52 Let's hope Russia can confirm the whereabouts of all stocks of this agent

1991 2018-03-14 12:18:49 What part of it allows you to have 30 round clips , full auto and bump stocks? None of it. I have the right to travel freely but that doesn’t mean I can travel 120 mph on the freeway
1992 2018-03-14 12:18:44 Right! Imagine if a bunch of stores suddenly announced they were going to accepts physical silver and gold. Do people think that gold and silverbugs would suddenly flock to them to buy stocks and burritos?
1993 2018-03-14 12:18:31 Of all the drowned kids they’ve pulled out of pools . So I can completely understand and agree with a person not wanting to own a gun. But I’ll never tell someone they can’t. Except full auto or bump stocks. No one can convince me why those are necessary.
1994 2018-03-14 12:16:17 I’ve grown this really bad habit of waking up to watch stocks pre-market and idk what to do with myself

2038 2018-03-14 11:47:43 There are often several valid alternative ways of counting corrective price action, I try and narrow it to the highest probable path or where the most different counts overlap with each-other, and also look for clues from the ind sectors and stocks.

2044 2018-03-14 11:43:33 ETFs are a GREAT vehicle for investors.  But they've gotten huge yet rely on market makers to keep the ETF price in line with the value of the basket of stocks represented.

2068 2018-03-14 11:19:57 The difference is with stocks and forex, the system exists to facilitate trading so that investors can make a profit. With betting the system exists to make a profit and the "investors" win as an incentive to keep investing.

I started to notice they did on Monday, so I just kept very tight SLs on longs.

2088 2018-03-14 11:07:34 Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday:
1. Stocks keeping tabs on Trump tariffs, Washington turmoil
2. Focus on retail sales data
3. Oil trades higher ahead of input on U.S. supply
4. ECB needs more evidence on inflation dynamics
5. Google to ban crypto ads
2089 2018-03-14 11:07:25 But one thing I have tried to do a lot more is constantly revaluate the market, key sectors (i.e. financials, tech, defense), and key stocks (both large cap and growth stocks - i.e. AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MU, TWTR, BA, JPM, GS, etc) at the end of the day.

2109 2018-03-14 10:52:59 It's undoubtedly a lot of people making money for themselves by stoking up fears in the population.

2110 2018-03-14 10:52:49 The biggest plus to follow & trade few stocks is you just get familiar with them & their Price Action.
But you must review the list over the certain time period;
with factors like Volatility, Price Ranges, Key Moving Averages, Sectorial Behaviour wrt to Over All Market Condition.

We must not require the impossible.

2514 2018-03-14 04:54:15 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks because they increase the firing rate of a rifle is like banning cars that travel faster than the speed limit and banning all parts that make that possible. Makes as much sense. Leave them alone.

2588 2018-03-14 03:55:19 Mr President,
Although I could care less about bump stocks if you truly feel this will help the situation you are ill informed or foolish. One can bump fire a weapon from hooking their thumb in their belt loop, will those be outlawed next?

2597 2018-03-14 03:49:03 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!

2640 2018-03-14 03:12:35 Since SM is out there buying everything can they buy YG stocks so we can have @RVsmtown and #Blackpink collab
2641 2018-03-14 03:12:31 first, sment compared nct's success to bts.
and now, they bought keyeast stocks, w/c is the mngt. that handles bts in japan, making them the largest stockholder.  (correct me if im wrong)
2642 2018-03-14 03:11:11 Stock holders are definitely not liking the fact that SM became the largest shareholders by the way FNC Ad Culture stocks are plummeting right now
2643 2018-03-14 03:10:22 The way ppl are acting to this news of SM buying stocks in other companies and acting as if your faves are all under SM now - practically other than music distribution, nothing is really different? It's like the house you're living in is now not solely under your name.

2658 2018-03-14 03:00:16 Perhaps, but I don’t think it’s an argument people take seriously on either side. I also don’t think this is an area of law that anyone will not pay attention to ever again.

I addressed bump stocks already. They should be regulated like full auto weapons under the NFA.

2717 2018-03-14 02:29:35 The S&P/#ASX 200 dipped 0.8% to 5,928 points. #Telecom sector led the fall while gold stocks were one of the few bright spotsAll the major #banks were down between 0.7% to 1.3%.
2718 2018-03-14 02:29:31 Let’s get THIS done:                      Universal background checks. Ban assault-style rifles. Outlaw bump stocks. Limit magazine capacity to ten rounds. That’s a good start. More to come.
2719 2018-03-14 02:29:21 I'm still around because I DIDNT follow any of your "picks" and actually learned to trade real stocks and learned to read financial statements, accounting, market behavior, etc. You're one of those guys that are the reason most beginning traders fail.

MJ's showed 16 up 37 down on my list.
2724 2018-03-14 02:24:37 Wow, reviewing @AjAwesomecalls 's recent swings & they have been on point. I'm bad at swinging stocks as I typically go too much size & can't add but I'm going to start nibbling on the next few. $ESPR low 70's to 80's, $PTI $3's to $7's, $RVNC $31 to $34 all w/in days

2760 2018-03-14 01:56:29 #NRA gave him this "weapon of war" or something... Eventhough no armory on any military base stocks AR-15's and they're never used in combat, but #LiberalLogic dictates that they're #WeaponsOfWar (because #AssaultWeapons wasn't quite strong enough terminology).
2761 2018-03-14 01:56:25 idk shit about m&a but the article mentioned sm buying bae yong joon's (who's a major shareholder & cso) share in keyeast and its an acquisition but bae yong joon also bought sm's stocks so he's now a major shareholder of sm and they're friendly and working tgt in the same group
2762 2018-03-14 01:55:48 Caller asks about raising the age limit to buy guns.  @SenDeanHeller discusses Fix NICS, bump stocks, conceal carry reciprocity, does not answer her question in any way.  Closes with "I support the 2A."
2763 2018-03-14 01:54:55 Why do you say so? We take stocks that are in focus (price move, news or brokerage) and ask our guests about their view.
2764 2018-03-14 01:54:29 FNC Add Culture’s stocks dropped tho....
2765 2018-03-14 01:54:10 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now. @KamalaHarris #GunControlNow #AR15 #ArmingTeachers is stupid
2766 2018-03-14 01:53:40 Yes that means that we would like to not have classification of firearms not based on colour of and exclusion of wooden stocks to go from non restricted to restricted.... This is pure propaganda...RCMP did not have control during Harper. Was there an increase in firearms & crime?
2767 2018-03-14 01:53:11 What does the biz expect. Devalue brands! Reduce the cost to move overproduced merchandise and further dig a hole by discounting at historic levels. Buying any of these companies stocks without some serious guidance is not prudent until they realize it is Not a race to the bottom
2768 2018-03-14 01:52:55 It would cause a major shift in investment for some people. Selling up bank shares and Telstra and alike and move into growth stocks or more overseas funds/ETFs

2776 2018-03-14 01:47:00 That’s not the rifle - that’s the magazine (from my understanding). Totally agree - ban magazines that hold more than x bullets. Ban bump stocks. Ban triggers that fire on pull and release. Implement a waiting period, background and mental health checks and repeat them annually.
2777 2018-03-14 01:45:38 SM busy taking care their stocks not their artists 
2778 2018-03-14 01:45:04 With some patience you can buy less liquid stocks.

2780 2018-03-14 01:44:01 Absolutely unacceptable that Congressvwill not ban bump stocks and military style assault weapons, tighten background checks, close gun show loopholes n show and online loopholes, and raise the age to 31 immediately!
2781 2018-03-14 01:43:38 I would hope we can agree on banning military-style assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks, at least.  Ordinary civilians don’t need them.
2782 2018-03-14 01:43:31 Soon as I get where I need to be I’m putting a lot of my money in stocks getting a nice job and going off the grid until I’m rich in that order
2783 2018-03-14 01:42:24 He threw out options and his bosses at the NRA told him no. He was for the 21 year old age limit, banning bump stocks, better background checks. NRA opposed them all. Now we're at the ridiculous idea of arming teachers. The opposite of a solution.
2784 2018-03-14 01:39:49 Regarding tax cut.  Less than 50% of Americans have stocks, including retirement accounts.  Heller claims the over $170 Billion in stock buybacks are good for "the majority" of Americans and retirees.  What do you think NV voters?

2788 2018-03-14 01:38:24 For the record I’m not rooting against $trtc I hate seeing OTC stocks reverse split. I really wish $trtc would up-list to Nasdaq. Would be happy for everyone in it. Unfortunately that isn’t going to happen. I do think after they dilute 40 million USD at 70% of PPS it will bounce.

2796 2018-03-14 01:33:33 I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin with that. I understand technical analysis and basic fundamental analysis but the fundamental analytics that for into stocks and options is beyond my capability.

2824 2018-03-14 01:20:12 @simonahac Rather than super fund managers dicking around with stocks, why don't governments give those fund mangers incentives to invest in bonds for housing construction and sustainable energy hardware.
2825 2018-03-14 01:20:12 This is ridiculous.   All stocks fluctuate, looking at the 50 day and 200 day moving average and the stock is way up.  If it drops slightly over 2 days big deal.  Before making dumb statements wait awhile it’s the stock market for crying out load.

2828 2018-03-14 01:17:17 My objection to the NRA is they fight against better background checks, stopping the sale of bump stocks & large magazines.  Truth be told we need a gun registry so we know who owns what. Not to take them away.  No one wants to take your guns away from you.
2829 2018-03-14 01:17:04 Not a new idea but would address a lot of problems. Still, when all is said and done AR-15 (and comparable guns), high-capacity magazines and bump stocks have to go.

2847 2018-03-14 01:04:22 I joined you and am disappointed in bothe format and the content.  For gun control should I focus on: 1 mental illness 2 for bump stocks or 3 for raising the age or 4 leave it.  What the heck senator!  Let’s talk about school murdering in person.

2851 2018-03-14 01:01:32 John your NICS work is resectable but it’s a band aid for a trauma victim. Felons can buy assault weapons from private sellers, bump stocks are legal, if there was ever a time for you to show your allegiance to Texas and not the @NRA now is a good time

2856 2018-03-14 00:58:37 SM acquires KeyEast?!?!?!? and largest stocks in FNC Ad?!??! aren't those two doing well or did SM give up a limb for both?? But knowing SM, they won't acquire something they won't profit from. At this point they've boxed out all  sides of the industry.

I need some replies on why we should not ban semi-automatic firearms, bump stocks, etc. I genuinely just want to know people's reasoning(s). Not only that, but I want some help as to wonder why...

2869 2018-03-14 00:45:47 Erik Paulsen trying to sound moderate on gun control. Ban bump stocks, blah blah. Nothing about closing the gun show loophole or universal background checks.  #MN03

2871 2018-03-14 00:44:10 @ClayTrader25 pays me @McDonalds #bigmac to bash stocks.
2872 2018-03-14 00:42:36 a matter of seconds, or have access to bump stocks and high-capacity magazines that would enable them to do so more easily. Because no minor or person who is danger to themselves or others should ever, ever be able to buy a gun with such ease...

2874 2018-03-14 00:40:33 She is 100% tosser alright. Farking touched 4.3 like million times, it’s like someone’s play toy. I shoulda traded the swings instead of holding all stocks tight like a muppet
2875 2018-03-14 00:40:06 I think theres a war coming. Theres a bear market in front of us por stocks. They wont be going public in the middle of this mess that is about to start. If they need some kind of financing they would make lot of money selling  crude.

2879 2018-03-14 00:38:14 SM Entertainment buying stocks from agencies out there. Acquired 2 so far. What?!

2880 2018-03-14 00:38:02 Problem is, it's rarely so clean for most stocks. Nothing easy about trading.
2881 2018-03-14 00:37:31 Had a close 12cb with @NYid07. Lost by 4 stocks. I'm taking it next time. ggs
2882 2018-03-14 00:37:00 The biggest structural advantage to investing in small illiquid microcaps is "bigger smarter" money can't buy them until their stocks are higher and more liquid.
2883 2018-03-14 00:36:50 In these maniac´s minds the industrial complex needs to be perpetuated no matter what. They will arm themselves to the teeth even if no enemy exists. Defense stocks may well actually be the quintessential form of utilities.
2884 2018-03-14 00:36:00 Whats with SM buying major stocks of other agencies. Their monopoly game is strong.
2885 2018-03-14 00:34:41 @TraderJoesList what happened to the Miami store? Stocks low employees on the floor complaining about the bathroom dog in store cashier too busy chatting with Co worker to greet me. Wow. So disappointed.
2886 2018-03-14 00:34:39 Hallelujah! The trouble is, property investment is seen as a no-brainer to average working families who have no trusting access to, nor understanding of stocks and bonds. Your employer Ross,  is just as guilty of talking up talking up the market like background auctioneers.
2887 2018-03-14 00:34:18 I am generally curious what is your stance on the second amendment? I hear you talk a lot about banning bump stocks. What else are you wanting to ban? What is you opinion on the new bills about raising the legal age to 21 to buy a firearm?
2888 2018-03-14 00:33:51 I am the captain of the police and Colin Powell wanted me to arrest 5 men that he said was threaten him they all are liars and backstabbers.911 was to kill and take over other people business and stocks was Donald Trump and. All the generals. FBI, CIA.

2897 2018-03-14 00:23:53 Well, he TRIED to spray 100 rounds at a time. He stupidly used bump stocks and caused several of his rifles to jam from the high rate of fire, since semi-auto AR-15's aren't made to sustain that kind of rate of fire.

2900 2018-03-14 00:22:01 Watching Alex Gibney’s “Dirty Money” series on Netflix and @RebeccaLurye explains shortselling stocks in terms of the worth of a single cow.

Except at the end she concedes: “But the cow says, ‘But I’m worth everything to you.’”

2902 2018-03-14 00:20:53 As she is a former military person, please ask Jeanne will she continue to allow the @nra to control the legal purchase of ar15 guns with bump stocks to hunt humans in mass shootings in schools, churches, concerts, malls,  work, and every other place people exist.

2912 2018-03-14 00:11:42 Forming a school safety commission under hapless Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is like consigning the issue to a gaggle of geese. Slightly toughening background checks and banning bump stocks hardly amount to incremental progress. Sorry, students. Trump has wimped out
2913 2018-03-14 00:11:10 I was screening for stocks the other day with high ROE and low P/E and CAPC come up in the list of 23 stocks. So it is definitely showing up on screens. $CAPC

2915 2018-03-14 00:10:47 Yo trade penny stocks you should have about 10k in your trading account. I recommend 30k in general for trading. Most my teasing is penny stocks as they are most profitable. But with those rewards comes greater risk

2918 2018-03-14 00:08:47 Norway is a capitalist system with redistributionist tendencies, despite others calling it Socialist

Also tiny+homogenous - 5m or so people

Statoil is 2/3 owned by the state but invests profits in a sovereign wealth fund which is 67% overseas stocks - all Capitalist profits 
2919 2018-03-14 00:08:00 I voted to ban bump stocks. @chicagotonight @wttw #ChicagoTonight #ILRevolution
2920 2018-03-14 00:07:39 Mr. Wictor,

Are you familiar with how bump stocks work?
Have you seen videos of them being fired on you tube.
Are you aware that all the evidence indicates that a bump stock was not used?
Are you familiar with the “health Rangers acoustical analysis that indicates more shooters?
2921 2018-03-14 00:07:38 @JeanneIves says she has voted to ban bump stocks, and says she's not a member of the NRA, nor has she accepted contributions. But has an A rating with them
2922 2018-03-14 00:05:55 Passing laws that increase school security through the arming of teachers is controversial at best and is a poor substitute for responsible gun control. No one needs assault rifles, bump stocks or high capacity magazines.
2923 2018-03-14 00:05:18 Asia stocks open negative following the losses on Wall St after another high-profile departure in which President Trump sacked Secretary of State Tillerson, and with trade war concerns stoked as the US eyes tariffs on China
2924 2018-03-14 00:00:54 @michaelsantoli  I like Kuow but Kevin Warsh would be great Cohn replacement. Wish you would give more personal views on stocks but assume you aren’t allowed.
