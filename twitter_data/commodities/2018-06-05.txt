Se o BC usar spot para intervir tem que neutralizar o efeito nos juros, por isso swaps

108 2018-06-05 15:49:46 I wasn't commenting on your sobriety. 

The ease of obtaining or possessing ANY item ought to be inversely proportionate to how hazardous that item is. This is the case for MOST commodities, and ought to be the same for deadly weapons.
109 2018-06-05 15:47:12 Couldn't China resell these commodities?  They would lose some money in transaction/transport costs.  But they would also book this as imports from the U.S.  The U.S. would then see lower demand from other nations.

116 2018-06-05 15:24:12 This used to happen in CLE in the late 1990s (bills of lading re-marked to avoid US steel tariffs.)  This was a very good time to be buying steel stocks, commodities, etc.
117 2018-06-05 15:22:30 That could also be the case. I don't follow the microeconomic factors as much as the macro, but with world GDP now over potential, it should boost demand for commodities. What's the situation with the Escondida mine?

Can you also recognize other kinds of commodities which inherently fail in a free market system for other kinds of follies of human nature and short sightedness? Like the environment and health care?

149 2018-06-05 13:29:38 This is why what China is doing w/the CNY oil contract (& gaining the ability to print CNY for commodity imports more broadly) is so important.  If China can print CNY for commodities, given your chts, 1) Can China have a classic BoP crisis?  2) Why does China need USD reserves?

169 2018-06-05 12:32:23 Yeah, crime was surprisingly low during 2008 recession, & studies found that it's a result of there not being anything to steal, less money&commodities in circulation etc. Ppl are at home more,harder to steal. But in general,poverty breeds crime&studies support that fact.

177 2018-06-05 12:00:27 Proposed amendments to the Value Added (VAT) Act seek to change zero-rated commodities including pesticides & food items like flour to  exempt, which means that manufacturers will not recoup the 16% VAT cost and thus pass it on to consumers.

227 2018-06-05 08:17:58 How about we amend the Labor Code to include certain commodities as among a minimum wage earners' mandatory employment benefits? This way, minimum wage earners will not have to buy these commodities in sachets which end up polluting our waters.
228 2018-06-05 08:16:40 Obama's sactions on Russia caused a global glut of oil. Russia buys a lot of oil. More supply means lower prices. Foreign policy does indeed effect the price of commodities.

262 2018-06-05 04:01:49 I agree that chains can compete and pretty much every chain can compete for transactions. But what is actually competing for sound money in your opinion?

263 2018-06-05 03:48:20 Deer camp too?  This law is stupid. Commerce is theoretically effected by everything so theoretically they can control everything. You don’t have a right to force someone to make a cake. Buying commodities sure. But creating...nope.

269 2018-06-05 03:03:33 its painfully simple. all stuff people make is made by people. otherwise it's varied but this is common to all this stuff. commodities are chunks of people 's labor.  so considering labour Abrtractly as fungible: say it was rice. five grains of rice = 5 x 1 grain of rice.
270 2018-06-05 02:55:08 what are you even saying, obviously abstract labour is an abstraction from concrete labour. the amount of actual labour in all forms, considers fungibke, socially necessary (not actually performed)  to make commodities determines their relations in exchanges, i.e. value. what is

281 2018-06-05 02:09:05 The *value of the commodity is its relation to all other commodities in systems of generalized exchange.
282 2018-06-05 02:05:17 Further, we presumably agree that the only quantifiable material quality all the commodities have in common - thus the quantifiable quality that value must measure - is that they are products of labor.

284 2018-06-05 01:48:03 its not a measurement of any kind. value is the relation between commodities.tge value if a commodity is the set of every other commodity it will exchange fi
or as equivalent. the value if the bootpolish is some linen etc

304 2018-06-05 00:06:05 I have trouble agreeing with you there.  For example, saying "value of commodities is determined by labor time" you have introduced a category of "determination" that I don't think is found in Capital and have dropped a key abstraction about labor time.
