2 2019-03-20 23:58:23 I wonder what would happen if nobody voted? How do we transition to anarchy? Cos no1 worth voting for in SA. We r sold everyday like stocks. Even churches r taking advantage of d ppl, no single institution can b trusted. Why should we then vote? Somebody make me understand

4 2019-03-20 23:57:36 Trudeau is going to win again. Suckers. Get stoned man. Buy Cannabis stocks,... buy buy buy, Lambo soon.
5 2019-03-20 23:57:27 I learned TA in equities... Anyway, I'm bearish equities because the macro environment is UGLY right now, and we've just had the longest bull run since WW2, and stocks are historically overpriced. It's more a question of how much TA works at all with central banks intervening.

Luckily I found by chance a small shop on Gatsu Timor that actually stocks spare parts for water pumps - a rarity here.
11 2019-03-20 23:51:23 I was with e*trade for over 12 years, stock trading, banking, and even mortgages three houses through them. They fired me 5 years ago.  Said my account was too risky (I had 100% of my IRA in three Bio Stocks).  Been with Fidelity since and I’m up about 425% 5 years at Fidelity.
12 2019-03-20 23:51:02 Sure that’s a possibility.  I’ve witnessed a td trader do the exact same thing always roughly 1 month to free trading on the pp.  I’m not certain it’s same guy because the other guy does it on mining stocks.
13 2019-03-20 23:50:05 Learning about stocks and investments is so fascinating
14 2019-03-20 23:49:53 I am just very glad that insulin manufacturers have prepared stocks far in advance of what the government asked for. Wasn't relishing the prospect of having to flee the country with my partner so they didn't die.
15 2019-03-20 23:47:25 We are long on precious metals and miners, short on stocks.
