1 2018-03-08 23:59:37 Dude, I'm wondering why I missed out on the fact that coconut oil has laxative like effects.  I clearly won't be having coconut oil coffee while heading out the door.

3 2018-03-08 23:59:20 I stressed myself out so I dipped myself in some lavender essential oil and just passed out from the fumes so it technically worked
4 2018-03-08 23:58:48 Oh I have that! I have a little tin with cedar essential oil in it for that purpose.
5 2018-03-08 23:58:47 Does anyone use CBD oil for pain/chronic illness? My mom needs something bad but I dont wanna waste money if it doesnt work.
6 2018-03-08 23:58:46 Yuck. Try slicing in half, scooping out and dicing the flesh, rinsing/wringing to rid bitter flavor, combine w diced romas and mozarella, lots of xv olive oil and garlic cloves to please your palate, and roasting until the kitchen smells divine.

9 2018-03-08 23:58:27 Whats your preference, Baby Oil or Scented Oil?
10 2018-03-08 23:58:25 There is a lot of conflicting info-the compound-Cannabidiol is what gives CBD oil it's pain relieving properties.
The reason CBD oil is made from hemp is no THC.
Cannabis sativa and Indica both have high THC levels.
11 2018-03-08 23:58:23 You're talking like the oil industry is the only industry in Canada, and the only source of tax revenue. If we stopped subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, whether through direct subsidies or constant EI payments for contract workers, the financials would be considerable
12 2018-03-08 23:58:15 Love youuu 
13 2018-03-08 23:58:12 ขอบคุณมากๆนะคะ เราเข้าใจ มันทนไม่ไหวเนอะ  เวลาเจอสิ่งที่คนอื่นว่าแล้วมันไม่ใช่เลย  คือทำไมต้องมาทำร้ายคนดีๆที่ไม่เคยทำไรให้คุณ
14 2018-03-08 23:57:43 This oil change taking too long.. I’m starving
15 2018-03-08 23:57:38 Private or national makes no difference if the only guy you can sell to DOESN'T NEED YOUR PRODUCT.
If we can't get it to tidewater we can't sell at world pricing. Why can't people understand that.
The US has a surplus and only buys our oil at HUGE discounts.
16 2018-03-08 23:57:21 all we eat is bread and drink wine. and moisturize our bodies with holy oil, for only the clean and pure.
17 2018-03-08 23:57:15 No alternative to good cheap aluminum. Certain things in the oil industry require certain metals. Good on em if they can find better materials, but those materials don’t exist today. @MichaelBerrySho

37 2018-03-08 23:57:06 neanderthal thinking...and lots of money in oil stocks
38 2018-03-08 23:56:55 I finally bought coconut oil. Bless.
39 2018-03-08 23:56:54 Government funding and private investment, the same way every other forward-thinking country is doing it. We don't seem to mind running a deficit when it comes to military action or subsidizing the oil industry, but when it comes to renewable energy, folks become deficit hawks.
40 2018-03-08 23:56:42 People ask me what foundation i use bitch coconut oil tf  barely know wtf foundation is miss me with the makeup shit fr.
41 2018-03-08 23:56:34 Need to throttle back on equalization payments to the East AND oil supplies to BC
42 2018-03-08 23:56:33 Nuts to that. I'll just stay here using up all Alberta's oil

47 2018-03-08 23:56:07 Perhaps remote Aberdeen should stop delivering oil to London then..
48 2018-03-08 23:55:53 @Cyril_Matvech Alberta has OIL...
49 2018-03-08 23:55:51 First item he took NIKKI COOKED IN HER LOFT ROOM AREA WERE WE TOOK IT OBER CAUSE I WAS CLOSTER FOB AT THE TIME HE TOOK MY DEEP FRYER TAKING NEED BROOW FOR FISH FRY THEN LATER IT HIT ME BUT NE BRING IN MY CHICKEN OIL CAUSE WE DONT KNOW WHO PLAYS IN FOOD
50 2018-03-08 23:55:50 Alberta has to assume 100% responsibility of any accidents in the pipeline. Leaks, cleanup, and other problems have to be their inheritance. B. C. Should impose maximum taxes to all exported oil out of B.C.
51 2018-03-08 23:55:44 I didn’t understand that either... BUT... like I said that bakery got sued over not making a cake for a gay couple (I’m all for marry whoever you want BtW, they can enjoy divorce like the rest of us lol). Serious, I would think that Case alone would set ‘precedent’.
52 2018-03-08 23:55:35 good ideal after all they keep complaining how bad oil is  for the environment
53 2018-03-08 23:55:20 Hypothetically, if Kenney is lying to his followers and he can’t stop the oil flow to B.C. then didn’t notley lie to her followers in the throne speech by advocating the same thing?  Your logic is contradicts itself Byers!
54 2018-03-08 23:55:19 Scotland needs to sit up and take notice of this particular quote, it is 100% on the money. The elitests want to pick a fight for oil, let them also fight it. I'll keep my kids home that day.
55 2018-03-08 23:55:00 don’t put anything on them. no castor oil or coconut oil. nothing! mine grew out faster when I didn’t apply anything because the pores weren’t blocked. leave them be !

58 2018-03-08 23:54:40 As any spaniard knows a diet of olive oil and trains keeps you healthy.

But yeah there's a lot of public services striking during Women's Day here in Spain.
59 2018-03-08 23:54:36 On top of all of this, if Canada wasn't willing to sell its resources to the lowest bidder and stack our regulatory bodies with industry insiders, people might be more supportive. Norway was at least smart enough to nationalize its oil industry, but that's just crazy talk.
60 2018-03-08 23:54:32 I think I made it clear that I am in favour of the NEW. I also understand that it takes HUGE investment in technology and education to be able to replace what we are doing now. No-one seems to be able to tell me how we pay for that, without selling our oil.
61 2018-03-08 23:54:31 -racial divide
-police hate
-medical insurance tax
-increased unemployment 
-Never protected our boarders
-protected killary
-did nothing for 100 days during the oil spill
-closed White house to the public
- bowed to world leaders

Good gosh so many thing.

68 2018-03-08 23:52:47 please let the news be that trump & kim are gonna oil wrestle 
69 2018-03-08 23:52:25 I have absolutely nothing against the British. But these tweets requesting our #POTUS get involved in South Africa trip me out. We foolishly helped in the 50’s to control oil that only belonged to Iran. Look at how that disaster turned out, and bites only us in the ass. PASS!
70 2018-03-08 23:51:55 I now have a heating pad and essential oil diffuser at my desk. It's like I aged 40 years and live in a spa.
71 2018-03-08 23:51:25 U deserve trashing

80 2018-03-08 23:49:52 I'm not mechanic but I can change oil, a tire, breaks, shocks and air filter. Feels good knowing some basic shit.
81 2018-03-08 23:49:52 Why does freaking palm oil have to be so environmentally unfriendly yet help make such lovely bars of soap?
82 2018-03-08 23:49:52 Gotta admit, I thought that was a bottle of body oil at first and the whole "moist" thing suddenly made a whole lotta sense 
83 2018-03-08 23:49:48 i know its a reach but if bts ever wins a grammy years from now I WILL PRINT THIS TWEET OUT AND HAVE IT OIL PAINTED AND ILL HANG IT ON MY WALL again I know its a reach but man let me dream ya know
84 2018-03-08 23:49:35 I will admit that solar panel production isn't the most eco friendly thing but the long term effects of clean energy heavily out weigh the risks of oil spills, possible people getting killed in oil drilling accidents, and the environmental concerns of fossil fuels
85 2018-03-08 23:49:25 It’s not a scam. It’s a defection. He would be on a Russian oil tanker headed for Vladivostok in 30 minutes flat.

87 2018-03-08 23:49:04 I actually got some writing done. It took a bowl of nacho chips, two extra coffees, an avocado oil drenched salad, and some incense, but there is more text on my pseudo steampunk/ancient alien novel. It helped too that I locked myself in the craft room...
88 2018-03-08 23:48:50 Not to mention all of the oil used as a bonding agent in asphalt. How much of that gets into the watershed? Don’t presume yourself entitled to lecture me on the environment. Or how intelligently you do it in CA, because I laugh at your derision.
89 2018-03-08 23:48:50 朝の家事が一段落したので、今日も１日ツムツムのイベントにどっぷりはまりたいと思います。おはようございます。
90 2018-03-08 23:48:39 Yes, the oil industry is all about the little guy. I understand the end employees are stuck in the middle on this, but we can't continue to blindly support a dying industry and pollute our environment.
91 2018-03-08 23:48:12 You gotta try this gummy bears oil I got.. it’s truly amazing.. 93.3% thc.. I’ll dm you a picture

94 2018-03-08 23:47:49 @tristan_mc97 once drank a whole bottle of wine before realizing it was extra virgin olive oil
95 2018-03-08 23:47:41 You would need oil to wiggle out of this one.
96 2018-03-08 23:47:15 Maybe you should try canning? But there they use too much oil!
97 2018-03-08 23:47:13 I remember one time I accidentally spilt tea tree oil all over my binder and backpack then the next day I was in lecture and someone yelled out, “who the HELL smells like that.”
98 2018-03-08 23:47:10 In truth, save the “good” (i.e. expensive and really tasty) olive oil for drizzling on finished dishes - because it’s raw. When cooking, ya don’t have to be as fussy, IMHO.  But God I love that Ina.
99 2018-03-08 23:47:09 Went in Our Pleasures one time and asked for lube and oil for chain saw, missus said they don’t carry that. I said false advertising, says the best lube and oil in town. Then I bust!! Missus said you are Victoria’s aunt. 
100 2018-03-08 23:47:00 If AB, through actions of Notley or Kenny looks increasingly like a bully, will be hard to promote oil pipelines as nation-building.
101 2018-03-08 23:46:56 im going to learn to cure mrsa with tea tree oil and rubbing alcohol when the grid falls im going to be the macgyver apocalypse doctor!!!!!
102 2018-03-08 23:46:51 You got it. Oil, money, taking over countries, puppet government, just like trump. Trump is Russian puppet president.

110 2018-03-08 23:45:33 No, it's made from industrial hemp...whole plant. Hemp seed oil, made from pressed hemp seeds contains ZERO Cannabidiol (CBD). Please don't confuse the two if you ate looking for CBD rich products.

114 2018-03-08 23:45:20 Considering that Russia has been supplying NK with oil and uranium. ..it's a no-brainer.

123 2018-03-08 23:43:42 The notion that a tax regime for one industry at variance with other industries is a subsidy as u suggest for the oil industry is ridiculous. It is far more complicated unless a country wants to cede all activity in certain industries entirely to other countries. #cdnpoli

126 2018-03-08 23:43:16 You're right, but most people aren't informed & can't add up. Everybody knows there's oil in CND Arctic, coz Putin's been drilling on his side for years, so Russia revendicates CND Arctic. Trump opened Alaska's Wildlife Refuge to drilling, so Cons would open CND Arctic too.

145 2018-03-08 23:41:01 Rise up! Stop this POS @SecretaryZinke. He refuses to do his job. The only damn thing he does is steal the taxpayers money & give our land to the toxic extractive industry, oil/gas & timber industry to clear cut our forests.
146 2018-03-08 23:40:50 *hobby drone crashes, starts fire razing half a square mile of forest*
we have to do something, this "hobby" is out of control, we need new laws

*oil rigs and tankers routinely leak/spill destroying whole ecosystems*
uhh join the cleanup effort, what an unavoidable tragedy :(
147 2018-03-08 23:40:43 I always assumed peanut oil.

150 2018-03-08 23:40:24 Ginger is amazing for nausea. If you have access to it CBD oil will also knock it right out. If it is acid related, crackers are always good.

153 2018-03-08 23:40:14 @pippaliciousj  have you tried cbd Oil?  It has helped me and many others greatly
154 2018-03-08 23:40:02 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
155 2018-03-08 23:39:58 I got some new oil paint thinner and WHOA I may be seeing new colors soon
156 2018-03-08 23:39:51 I’m starting an oil cult. Hit me up if you want to join and find out about every amazing oil for hair and skin benefits 
157 2018-03-08 23:39:43 Hope this makes us look inwards. There are many things that can generate greater income to Nigeria than oil. How I wish they stop buying it completely. We must develop our agriculture and solid minerals potential. Wake up Nigeria
158 2018-03-08 23:39:24 Where are these US paid supporters marching against oil coming into the east coast ports and the numerous new ports being built in the US. gets oil from Saudi, which just allowed women to DRIVE.  oil and gas is cleaner and has better Human rights than our importers.
159 2018-03-08 23:39:23 Got an oil change today & they vacuumed my car out too!!  way to come in clutch Mr. Brake & Lube, I fw y’all tough!

162 2018-03-08 23:38:26 The construction of a hydro electric dam creates DIFFERENT jobs. The skills in the oil/gas industry are highly skilled positions. The pipeline will allow the sale of our product at GLOBAL prices instead of a discounted price to the US. That translates into BILLIONS $$$.

168 2018-03-08 23:37:45 No no it will benefit the US that north America will finally have people in charge that want to better our economies and no line their own pockets. But no more oil, gas, and power for cheap for the US though

171 2018-03-08 23:37:20 If people had any imagination, they would be fighting back against trade agreements that have decimated Canada's manufacturing industry, and left us as little more than a resource base for countries such as China. But no, let's cut down our forests to run a pipe to sell them oil.
172 2018-03-08 23:37:09 man, listen, caffeine is ALL I need.  You throw coconut oil in there too?   Look out! lol

174 2018-03-08 23:37:06 Bottom line. Lard and coconut oil in moderation. Kind of a no brainer.
175 2018-03-08 23:37:02 Russians must have succeeded ..Who is Sec .of State? Oh yea, the guy who has oil deal with Putin.
176 2018-03-08 23:37:00 I would really love for that door to hit @SecretaryZinke on the way out.

185 2018-03-08 23:35:48 #TYTLive Cenk, I'm pretty sure Exxon wouldn't back off oil deal so fast just bc oil prices went down if they went to THIS much cost &effort. If it wasn't original goal-they've still gone all in on Trump. Q: Does tariffs on steel raise oil prices by raising the cost of drilling?
186 2018-03-08 23:35:34 InshaAllah

188 2018-03-08 23:35:31 Can we talk about how oil and gas are two main components of American economy. The pursuit and consumption of which are both destabilizing the socio/political framework of Middle Eastern countries as well as submerging climate of the globe into turmoil with Global Warming.

190 2018-03-08 23:34:56 The companies that suffer are not the BIG OIL guys. It is the small support businesses and contractors that are dying off. Mom and pop storefronts that can't keep the doors open.
People are losing their homes because you can't see the big picture.
191 2018-03-08 23:34:49 I really hate getting a damn oil change
192 2018-03-08 23:34:44 Use a Misto oil spray! You use way less EVOO. or I just use a little water on the skillet!
193 2018-03-08 23:34:36 They have a strong Mom to teach them....My baby girl is a VP at Shell Oil ,super wife, and Mom of 2 boys...did it all on her own!  Women can do and be whatever they want. Better than in this Vintage lady's youth! #InternationalWomensDay

195 2018-03-08 23:34:21 OIL BRENT US$63.85/bbl -1.16%. Oil retreats on flat demand and rising dollar.
196 2018-03-08 23:34:20 Ok but actually how do I get rid of the flu??? (I’m taking oil of oregano, Tylenol, drinking echinacea tea, sucking on echinacea cough drops, drinking orange juice).

I don’t wanna be sick anymore!!!!!! My to-do list is just getting longer 
197 2018-03-08 23:33:48 Students were learning about sustainability. They used oil and chalk pastels to create past and future landscapes and played theatre games focused on sustainability.
198 2018-03-08 23:33:46 Coconut oil is always my favorite makeup remover until I use a little too much and become blind
199 2018-03-08 23:33:39 Oil pipelines, trucks, skyscrapers, tunnels, football stadiums and power turbines among others were built using American Steel only, when George Washington was president. Trump’s a genius

204 2018-03-08 23:32:34 What’s this woman’s purpose? To get the workforce on picket lines behind oil drums with pit fires keeping them warm. What a dinosaur #bbcqt
205 2018-03-08 23:32:30 It’s all about Yuan oil
206 2018-03-08 23:32:28 This is where your lack of understanding shines through.
Hundreds of people in NE BC are out of work because the pipeline construction companies that employed them have gone out of business. Local businesses rely on the success of the SMALL PRIVATE oil/gas businesses.
207 2018-03-08 23:32:20 ...and then weasels more concessions out of us (food, oil, ...)
208 2018-03-08 23:32:18 My methods of A&P revision are definitely something, the reason I remember that the sebaceous gland produces oil because Seb off Coronation Street has greasy hair 
209 2018-03-08 23:32:11 Wow!! I’m not sure I believe that!!! Do they have to take the engine out to change the oil and filter???? If you’re right. What a waste!!! I’ll stick with my 2017 Ford Escape

224 2018-03-08 23:29:34 And raised the price of food, gas, oil, and steel. You will need the extra money. Oh did I mention decreasing demand for other US made goods by starting a trade war? Great job.
225 2018-03-08 23:29:19 Really?
Everything north of the valley is reliant on resource extraction.
Mining.
Oil.
Natural Gas.
Lumber.

Ever been to central BC where the softwood collapse left numerous towns as near ghost towns?
Just because Vancouver is booming doesn't mean others in the province are.

232 2018-03-08 23:28:16 @bbcquestiontime #bbcqt needs to talk about the end of oil economy by 2060 and how industry, commerce and government are planning for an 87% loss of power generation and 99% collapse of private transportation by 2050.

Construction will collapse...
233 2018-03-08 23:27:52 Scientists hate him
234 2018-03-08 23:27:19 If you're so against foreign involvement in Canadian resources, it must keep you up at night to hear that Nexen, Royal Shell, BP, Qatar and Motiva are all involved in the Canadian oil industry.
235 2018-03-08 23:27:12 Also don’t say some s*** about white people had money for hundreds of years. Jerry Jones is rich because his dad struck an oil field. Just how others are rich from inventions or companies. McDonald’s, Wal Mart, Amazon is not hundreds of years old.
236 2018-03-08 23:27:03 The waiting game for an Oil Change..

239 2018-03-08 23:26:48 The doors are wallpapered with hides from endangered species covered by dollar bills and dabbed with oil.
240 2018-03-08 23:26:39 Alberta has threatened to decrease the amount of oil shipped to the lower mainland. Keep it up.... if Alberta turns the tap off, you guys are screwed.
241 2018-03-08 23:26:37 Good lucks with your oil, Gas, Fish. But don't forget about reality check. Most likely you will be playing the puppet to many masters for the forseable future. Hopefully we can cross check reality in 6 months. I like to see how the mind of folks like yourself progress with time.

245 2018-03-08 23:26:15 FDA ain’t perfect but the standard to approve something that actually shows evidence that it works isn’t flawed. If someone can show, through research then the trial stages that an essential oil will kill cancer IN A PERSON (not just cells in a dish) it would be approved

251 2018-03-08 23:25:25 I use grapeseed oil as an acne treatment and to prevent it, to moisturize and control oil, moisturize my lips and under eye area and it's also as an anti aging preventative treatment

 it's honestly the best thing ever
252 2018-03-08 23:25:19 Yes you're comparing main street (socialism) 2 Wall Street (capitalism or corporations) Best is an equal balance! Occurs in many countries! Called the Middle Road! Had it during LBJ's Great Society 64-68. LBJ  powerful oil man had been Sen maj leader created many social programs!
253 2018-03-08 23:25:02 In North America we are subjugated by oil corporations and their bought politicians.

257 2018-03-08 23:24:48 I paid $60 for an oil change today, it’s about time i learn how to change my own oil
258 2018-03-08 23:24:35 I used to work for the executive sector of the oil/gas Fortune 500 businesses... think Haliburton, BP, etc.  Boy I hated pretending like I was a Republican who hated tree huggers so much that I literally would hug the trees in my yard just to say "sorry" every once in a while.
259 2018-03-08 23:24:32 V2.0 is a nice upgrade
260 2018-03-08 23:24:24 ... and is going to get severely worse approaching 2075 because oil supplies are running out.
261 2018-03-08 23:24:21 When #Iran was a kingdom, and king of oil (and technology & workmanship in the region) we didn’t have such rampant poverty. 

Whoever composed this meme, wrongly associates the poverty to timeless kingdom instead of Islamists that Western idiocracy installed.

269 2018-03-08 23:22:37 Norway, as an EFTA member never signed over fishing rights to its waters. As such it is likely the largest fishing nation in Europe and I believe is a large part of their exports! Probably relatively low value in gdp terms, because of oil I would guess. It is a strong card to use

290 2018-03-08 23:19:42 Then why wasn't everyone all up in arms when the Energy East pipeline was kiboshed? No threats to ban anything to/from Quebec?  Instead refineries in the eastern Canada puchase billions of Nigerian and Saudi oil instead of using Canadian oil.
291 2018-03-08 23:19:36 Thanks Greg, but I, my friends & neighbours aren't anybody's paid protestors. We are citizens who live here, work here, have retired here & contribute to our communities in ways you seem incapable of appreciating. We will not let you & your big oil pals destroy #BC #bcpoli @bcndp

299 2018-03-08 23:19:12 You know why oil and gas are a third of Russia's budget?  They didn't give corporations a giant tax cut #tytlive

305 2018-03-08 23:18:34 Ethanol is snake oil. And it does ruin engines & increases parts & maintenance costs, which offset any incremental fuel gains. And don't get me started on the Tier 4 diesel engine nonsense.
306 2018-03-08 23:18:31 That is what he does, he passes laws that he knows will not be popular on the sly, like killing off wild horses,wolves,bears & their cubs in their dens, letting oil companies drill in your National Parks the man is scum.

311 2018-03-08 23:18:05 So... what kind of oil is that fella?
312 2018-03-08 23:17:44 Lol nope ,I get meeting with God later,I need to sleep now,I need God in my life bro
313 2018-03-08 23:17:42 The end of oil economy is an even greater threat to global life, nevermind jobs. #BiotropicDesignSolutions
314 2018-03-08 23:17:38 1. Acting like Notley wasn’t always considering when/how oil shipments could be a bargaining tool in the KM debate is ridiculous. Condescending even.
2. Kenney wouldn’t have the chance to implement his threats because there’d be no climate plan and no pipeline approval. #ableg

317 2018-03-08 23:16:55 This summer I’m going to drink lots of water, soak up as much sun as my skin allows, coconut oil my skin, and continue to ignore boys.

322 2018-03-08 23:16:42 Just one more reason why no oil drilling should be allowed off of our coast.
323 2018-03-08 23:16:39 How long is it supposed to take for a damn oil change? 
324 2018-03-08 23:16:38 In fact, not only does it not help us, but the fact that you are saying we are currently so heavily dependent on oil means we should not be exporting oil to these markets. Thanks for making the point for me, however.
325 2018-03-08 23:16:30 So does Black Seed Oil actually help with hair growth ?
326 2018-03-08 23:16:25 We need wine and they need oil .. everybody just calm down @sjn1818

331 2018-03-08 23:15:08 Classic Zinke/Trump move - selling off taxpayer owned property to generate profits for oil companies/shareholders and campaign contributions for politicians while simultaneously socializing the damage costs to all other Americans.
332 2018-03-08 23:15:03 Local shares kick off Friday only slightly firmer. #ASX 200 +3pts or +0.05% to 5947. Mining & energy stocks under pressure (iron ore -4.3% & oil -1.7% overnight). Most other sectors up #ausbiz
333 2018-03-08 23:14:54 I’m getting my oil changed at a dealer/repair store and the guy was like “all right, which car is yours” and I got exasperated and said “what do you mean?! It’s the most gorgeous car in the lot!”

pointing to my old and rusting Honda
& he shook his head and tried not to laugh
334 2018-03-08 23:14:53 russia is not a capitalist system, you're an oligarchy ruled by a tyrant that run on oil production.
also they were speaking about the third world such as africa where prices are much much cheaper.
russia is more second world then third.
335 2018-03-08 23:14:42 He's not woke. He's trying to use discredited economic techniques from the 1920s to bring back industries that already had their day. What's next, whale oil, buggy construction? He should be focusing on what we're great at: tech, solar energy, medicine, space.
336 2018-03-08 23:14:34 maybe try double cleansing? basically you use an oil-based cleanser then follow up with a water-based cleanser. the oil cleanser removes sebum/blackheads then the water cleanser takes everything off. it drastically helps with my skin texture & acne. (also exfoliate!!)
337 2018-03-08 23:14:19 #RafaelCruz dirtied his hands while grabbing money from Big Oil pockets, we need #BetoForTexas, not bought and paid for. #VoteBlue
338 2018-03-08 23:14:15 I am 100% behind alternative/renewable energy but it will require a robust economy, flush with revenue to lead the way to that magic moment. Between then and now, we still need to pay the bills. Put your energy into alternatives to replace oil/gas.

344 2018-03-08 23:13:45 Make sure you oil it and moisturise the skin underneath it to keep it in tip top shape .
345 2018-03-08 23:13:33  ok Mongolian "turk" who sells oil to #Israel we believe you.
346 2018-03-08 23:13:28 u right. i use salicylic acid face wash. and have been prescribed 2 different medications to fuck up my oil glands and immune system just so i can have clear skin. but i do drink water also :)
347 2018-03-08 23:13:24 Wy hasn't voted blue since 1964.  No surprise.  Coal, gas, oil, you name a dirty energy, Wyoming has it.
348 2018-03-08 23:13:18 I'm old enough to remember when everyone said deep red Alabama would elect an alleged Republican child molester over a Democrat. 

You think steel tariffs are going to play well in an oil and gas state?  Regardless of it hurts our industry, you and Rafael will do nothing.
349 2018-03-08 23:13:16 for those who think pineapples on pizza is the worst thing ever... have you ever accidentally bit into a fish oil tablet? lmao
350 2018-03-08 23:13:00 He already has commemorative flags and coins. Have to wonder if he had a big Zinke seal emblazoned on this new door.
Maybe he can get the $$ from the mining and oil barons he's opening our public lands to to pay for that door.

353 2018-03-08 23:12:31 One thing I'm doing this month and probably the next is cutting out sugar and also I've been taking evening primrose and safflower oil twice a day.. not had enough time to see any effects yet but both things are supposed to be great!

355 2018-03-08 23:11:58 CBD is miraculous! We haven't been able to keep the CBD products in stock in our office. We just got this CBD oil and this is the first time I've done a full hour session and it's pretty amazing
356 2018-03-08 23:11:50 Like the English minority in Iran who began to suffer a loss of capital when democracy voted to nationalize oil. We fixed that for them real quick and nothing bad ever happened again.
357 2018-03-08 23:11:37 Was in a tiny store picking up some sage & lavender incense. For $5 got little rollerball bottle filled with an oil really loved smell of called "Bedroom Eyes."
358 2018-03-08 23:11:22 @WaddleandSilvy @TWaddle87 The claim of muscle memory and bowling it true but also false. As the game progresses. The oil pattern spreads and changes the spin of the ball. You might have the same "stroke" but the surface changes every throw.
359 2018-03-08 23:11:13 Sleep with coconut oil on your hair once a week
360 2018-03-08 23:10:53 But women get maternity leave, or how about they don’t work nearly any of the dangerous jobs men work, like coal mining, or oil rigs. Take those type of jobs out of the equation and women may actually make more.

367 2018-03-08 23:10:16 it's good, but it would be so much more interesting if they were stacked in order of carbon intensity. I see oil growing a lot.
368 2018-03-08 23:10:03 Any friends wanna some oil slicks? Would prefer to sell them all together
369 2018-03-08 23:10:02 It's about hegemony of a clique of ambitious mercenaries our to impose a satrap in AP so this clique can loot has from Godavari basin in AP which will change world equations. US is largest oil producer today! New realities, new power politics, new ambitions & no regard for law
370 2018-03-08 23:09:58 Second - shipping oil to to Asian markets in order to fuel the over-production of wasteful consumer goods that are contributing to mountains of garbage and reducing the North American economy to little more than a buying base for goods produced in Asia helps us how, exactly?
371 2018-03-08 23:09:42 We were going to buy a new car this year. Now we won't if the price goes up. Trump's the biggest hypocrite, using Chinese steel for years & Russian steel for his oil pipelines in 2017, not to mention family factories in China, Egypt, etc.

374 2018-03-08 23:09:23 Koch brothers are involved in Alberta oil. NRA's probably backing NFA & Russia channeling money to NRA. Cons won't open their books, about where their funding comes from. No, doesn't seem farfetched. Only bugger's Trudeau, since he stopped opening CND Arctic to drilling.
375 2018-03-08 23:09:17 Jimin probably posted it
376 2018-03-08 23:09:03 Hey @HiltonHotels, blocking entire floors of hotels and creating MAJOR accessibility issues for a private oil and energy conference is SUPER cute. Thanks.
377 2018-03-08 23:08:45 Acrylic & oil. Sometimes must charcoal sketches. I like painting portraits of people, but will paint animals for commissions sometimes. There always seems to be a high demand for that.
378 2018-03-08 23:08:39 OF COURSE the day I wear coveralls is the day I have to get my oil changed. I am walking into coverall territory here.
379 2018-03-08 23:08:19 Transformers of the oil-filled type can be put out of commission if you pour water, salt water, machine-tool coolant, or kerosene into the oil tank.
380 2018-03-08 23:07:49 Jamal, the ball is in my court, and there is no carte blanche.  International Community wants my oil, Gas, and Fish, so I'll dictate, whatever I want period.
381 2018-03-08 23:07:34 Why do you have to insult ruskikungfu? I wish Incursions would be even half of what snake oil style is. His hands are ultrafast and super tactical, like in 1:02 when the other hand distracts and the other hand hits enemy with speed of lightning. Ruskikungfu = martial art of kings
382 2018-03-08 23:07:33 I have olive oil in my ear rn lol
383 2018-03-08 23:07:28 Yes. What are you talking about. I jump on thread and see something about oregano oil burns.
384 2018-03-08 23:07:26 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
385 2018-03-08 23:07:26 First off, the proposed pipelines are for exporting oil to foreign markets. With that stated, the plan should be to continue to use existing infrastructure and routes while plans are made to shift away from fossil fuels, not invest in new infrastructure. It isn't complicated.
386 2018-03-08 23:07:04 I always got along better with girls than guys. I never grew up learning guy stuff. I can’t change the oil in my car. I can’t fix stuff (besides computers).

I grew up watching Bob Ross with my mom and cooking shows.  She read epic fantasy novels to me as a kid.

390 2018-03-08 23:06:25 Depends on what precautions they took ... my knowledge in this area is a bit patchy to say the least, but if it was more oil based than aerosol might have been easier to work with?
391 2018-03-08 23:06:25 Getting your "oil changed" huh.... 
392 2018-03-08 23:05:40 Sure, it's dirty. I think of oil production as being like mining (another Cdn resource industry): it's dirty, but we need metals. Same with oil: the reason AB produces it is that people still want it. Even in Vancouver we have a huge fleet of gas-burning vehicles.
393 2018-03-08 23:05:38 I love the Venezuela argument, once it's not socialists as it's run by in essence a dictator, secondly Venezuela has 1 export that counts accounts for 95%+ of it's total exports. If the only export in America was oil, and it was run by oil comps the collapse would happen still.
394 2018-03-08 23:05:32 McCrone report 1974 It's 2018! Where's the up to date compelling economic argument? No point trading questions. You'll take the line it's oor oil, all tories evil. Take that as a victory if you like since you didn't get one at the ballot box. Speak GermanAssumed Gaelic.

399 2018-03-08 23:04:55 CBD oil is not made from cannabis-it's from from commercial hemp seeds.
CBD stands for  cannabidiol oil. cannabidiol is one of the cannbinoid compounds found in hemp and both cannabis sativa and cannabis indica-only the latter two contain THC- which gets you high from cannabis.

405 2018-03-08 23:03:57 Guess what other countries are actively trying to trade oil for gold instead of dollars? Russia, Iran, & Syria. coincidence?

Why are the Saudi’s never targeted by US for human rights violations? Because hey uphold the petrodollar standard, despite murdering gays and dissidents
406 2018-03-08 23:03:56 !! if you know you're gonna wear lipstick the next day (or just a tip in general??) before you go to bed, put a small amount of argan/coconut oil on your lips! in the morning, when you wash it off, it should keep you moisturized enough for the day to withstand matte lipstick!!
407 2018-03-08 23:03:41 Hi ladies does anyone know why my face turns completely red like I have sunburn when I put rosehip oil on
408 2018-03-08 23:03:29 They always speak like Alberta "owns" the oil. Both the pipeline and the products in it are all owned by multinational companies.

This isn't Venezuela! Its literally impossible for her to carry through. the threat couldn't be more stupid.
409 2018-03-08 23:03:28 Remember when I used to put coconut oil on my face.

411 2018-03-08 23:03:06 I would agree, its similar to a blind cultish, charlatan approach like Trump, believe me, don't look anything up, I want to be the epicenter of all your information, so I'm your unquestionable astute leader that you follow  blindly. Resonates like Snake oil..just a thought

Why did we topple him and not the Saudi’s? Because Gaddafi’s crimes had nothing to do with the treatment of his people. He was creating a gold backed African currency. He wanted to trade oil for gold, not USD.

425 2018-03-08 23:01:26 1. There was big support outright in 2011/2012 in big numbers for 1) An outright ban as central demand of politicians and 2) Non engagement with the EPA on the basis that it's process was tainted by Aberdeen oil funded academics. We were called 'aggressive', 'intimidating' for .

428 2018-03-08 23:01:10 Good time to remind people that the oklahoma Dems voted against a 5k teacher raise and an 100% oil and gas tax raise
429 2018-03-08 23:01:07 Tanya, Obama put in place Russian sanctions. Trump never lifted them, what are you talking about? Trump opening our oil fields is destroying Russia Oil & gas industry bc putin can't sell as low as we can now we are exporting oil... more effective. The DNC talking pts are wrong.

443 2018-03-08 22:58:24 FWIW my friend's husband is a petroleum engineer-his firm is paying for him to go to law school to do oil & gas law and he says it's harder than his grad school. But he's naturally very laid back. Also, he's not used to all the writing. Everyone has different stress thresholds.

453 2018-03-08 22:57:14 #bbcqt We have no influence over Russia, their oligarchs seem to own large parts of London, so their money in our banks will mean no action taken. Europe needs Russian oil and gas more than Russia needs us.

463 2018-03-08 22:55:32 Sanders long time belief is he ultimately wants the govt to own main sectors like energy, oil, steel, healthcare. He's just been wussy about saying it publicly.
464 2018-03-08 22:55:08 Got a sore throat & stuffy nose, so last night made sure to put olbas oil into the little humidifier lamp thingy we have (I love that thing!). Also today I've been topping up on tea & honey. Still feel a bit worn out, but at least it's calmed the fuck down a lot :D
465 2018-03-08 22:55:07 I have a couple of modifications in mind. May chuck in some finely cut garlic in there next time. Or mix some mustard in olive oil before adding it to the mix.

471 2018-03-08 22:54:15 Regarding cold winter - yes in North America, but Europe had a mild spell until the late spell in Feb-March, so those have offset when we look at the global picture for oil demand. I do agree that current estimates for oil demand growth are on the high side.

487 2018-03-08 22:51:45 British Petroleum oil spill did cause issues in 1993.  However, that was temporary issue 4 some Gulf creatures.  This is why they were fined millions.  However, today, 2018, our Gulf shrimp, fish R not appearing in TX stores/ instead we are getting Vietnam, Cambodian farmed chit

493 2018-03-08 22:51:24 Is that why he held up refineries and the Keystone Pipeline?
When was the last time a refinery was built in the US?
He still restricted production on Public Lands every chance he got.
The vast majority, 90% of oil production was on Private Lands.
494 2018-03-08 22:51:07 Al Gore has a conflict of interest. If we shut down the oil sands tomorrow his country's shale oil industry will gladly take it's place. How much greenhouse gas do they produce? We don't have Facebook or Google. We have resource extraction. #onpoli #canpoli
495 2018-03-08 22:51:04 Clearly not, without question. Am about to tell a friend I won't buy his company's food products anymore having discovered they contain palm oil! 
496 2018-03-08 22:50:51 If she sees more moves to delay construction, they want to pass legislation to restrict the flow of oil & natural gas? I’m confused. We have a bottleneck so to make  a point you want to increase that bottleneck by restricting flow? 
497 2018-03-08 22:50:38 Johnny and Paul, do I need to save my $50 bucks each month so I can give it back to the government next April when the tax increases kick in? You lying snake oil politicians.

647 2018-03-08 22:31:22 That was all due to legislation that should not have been enacted. We have more oil and gas than anyone.  About 250 years worth according to most estimates. We should be selling what we have to the whole world.

654 2018-03-08 22:30:23 Being preventive is important, especially when it comes to your vehicle's engine. There is a lot of attention on oil changing schedule, but another aspect that you shouldn't overlook is the cooling system. Your radiators, thermostat, and coolant will also need attention.

680 2018-03-08 22:27:52 I think the point they are making is that the new rates are reasonable, but the Government has to use the funds properly. This is my view too. We are used to free things , being left alone , fiscally undemanding Government that we also allow to eat oil incomes in peace.
681 2018-03-08 22:27:26 JUST IN: Alberta Premier @RachelNotley is threatening to expand a fight with BC over the Trans Mountain pipeline by reducing the amount of oil her province ships. Notley won't say if she would cut off BC or the rest of Canada -- or both.
682 2018-03-08 22:27:20 They all live in the same oil-dependent world as you Tau and nobody is saying stop using or even drilling for oil right now. But we HAVE to stop looking for new oil. The science shows clearly that we cannot afford to burn even known reserves, search for more is madness.

704 2018-03-08 22:24:15 FYI, in 1980, Lougheed passed a regulation that restricted the amount of oil that could leave the province. Also stopped permits for natural gas exports. That was in response to the National Energy Plan. #ableg #bcpoli

713 2018-03-08 22:23:12 She means California olive oil. You're welcome.
714 2018-03-08 22:22:59 Hydrocortisone; bandaids; tea tree oil
715 2018-03-08 22:22:57 The pmo had to issue a statement yesterday afternoon saying that Nye came pro bono. As in: he's so hates Canadian Oil and Gas that he would come for free from California to bash it
716 2018-03-08 22:22:54 I'm a man tooso equation remains
717 2018-03-08 22:22:40 The West is taking Iraqs oil,while the Turks and Kurds fight over it,& anything else they could find to fight over,??
718 2018-03-08 22:22:33 Can only imagine Angel Di Maria feels he left MUFC prematurely. Is there a way back? Not likely. Anyway, PSG has become a symbol for everything what's wrong with the modern game. The negative effects of oil&gas found in the Middle East now even seen in European football, amazing!
719 2018-03-08 22:22:28 A revolving door big enough to fit his head along with the heads of every oil exec, foreign and domestic... why are we surprised?
720 2018-03-08 22:22:26 There are entirely synthetic engine oils already available, and  engine oils aren’t burnt anyway, so can be largely recycled. You  can also manufacture crude oil from algae.

Technically feasible is only a few years and investment away from production.
721 2018-03-08 22:22:25 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's government lays out plan for dealing with BC in the future over pipeline saying that blocking oil and gas shipments to BC are on the table in the Trans Mountain dispute. #bcpoli #abpoli
722 2018-03-08 22:22:13 #HappySugaDay #GeniusYoongiDay HAPPY BIRTHDAY! THE BEST HAS YET TO COME. REMEMBER BTS should already start taking nutrition seriously, health proteins + healthy fats, some strength training to protect joints, Fish Oil for joints!, Get Chiropractic treatment regularly and massage!
723 2018-03-08 22:22:08 Constantly drinking water, hot lemon and manuka honey tea, sanitize everything, keep pillow cases/sheets clean, humidifier with eucalyptus and lavender oil. And i know you’re Virgo so it’s hard lol but sleep.
724 2018-03-08 22:22:02 Of course you would, she sold off every thing of value had trillions from North Sea oil. Had thatcher been a truly visionary politician, she would have established a wealth fund for the oil windfall, not squandered it on tax cuts and current spending.
725 2018-03-08 22:21:50 ALBERTA THRONE SPEECH: Remember that threat Kenney made to restrict BC's oil supply if there's more pipeline opposition, the threat Rachel Notley largely laughed at? 
Heh, it's more or less repeated in the throne speech, and in legislation Notley said is coming. #ableg
726 2018-03-08 22:21:35 This white chocolate glazed dried fruit kinda smells of oil? Paint thinner? When you bite it, on the inside. And leaves an aftertaste that makes me feel like I'm back at my prep courses in the Grekov art college, with all the oil paint scent out of every workshop.

728 2018-03-08 22:21:22 Well the Antarctica thing was meant to be a joke, as all of humanity owns it (until oil is confirmed to be found in the Antarctic archipelago). Liechtenstein is because, well uh... *dives through widow to avoid admitting to my mistakes*

742 2018-03-08 22:18:39 Pretty sure I’m getting scammed by @jiffylube $90+ for an oil change on my tundra. My normal shop only charges around $50. #ripoff
743 2018-03-08 22:18:28 Ugh I cannot stand coming to car shops. Sir, can I have my oil change and go?

745 2018-03-08 22:18:18 Throne speech says Alberta government will "do whatever it takes" to get the Trans Mountain pipeline built, including limiting the flow of oil and gas to British Columbia.
746 2018-03-08 22:18:16 @WeWantEbie hi sissy . You ever get your oil ?
747 2018-03-08 22:18:06 Dreams and Nightmares with this Tahoe Og oil & the Weather 
748 2018-03-08 22:18:04 Previous BC Govt had negotiated to receive Billions of dollars from the pipeline for BC but NDP said no! - 90’/, of Vanc area oil/gas comes from Alberta who just cancelled building a new refinery due to lack of demand. Only 1 refinery in Vanc area. Only Ab oil customer is USA.
749 2018-03-08 22:17:59 So @acitrano got a nostril full of weird, went to investigate, HYPERinvestigated and found the equivalent of a mastodon skeleton from picking up a pebble. Read his timeline, its pretty rad. This place was all oil fields (cause we are living over oil)

754 2018-03-08 22:17:35 Shame on you for support terorism regime money by  our oil dollar
755 2018-03-08 22:17:25 @OGXBeauty It’s a shame most of your conditioners have silicone in! The whole point of using a brand like yours is to not have the silicone! All silicones leave build up & aren’t biodegradable! The best natural alternatives to dimethicone are Broccoli Seed Oil and Meadowfoam oil.

758 2018-03-08 22:17:01 @RyanZinke Was it all taxpayer money that paid for your $140K door or did you use the oil company slush fund?
759 2018-03-08 22:16:48 Rex Tillerson should just go back to selling oil and gas. His African trip is political landmines and he keeps marching on and setting them off.
760 2018-03-08 22:16:41 Qaddafi was not killed for humanitarian purposes but for the oil and for money. His ideas of an African gold-backed currency were his major undoing !
761 2018-03-08 22:16:40 Has anyone heard that CBD oil helps IBS?  The more I read about neuroimmune disease the more it seems to always go back to the gut and antibiotic resistant infections.
762 2018-03-08 22:16:39 We balanced the budget on $13 oil in 1995.

769 2018-03-08 22:15:56 So anyway good job, me, for keeping the car insured and legal. Now I just need to get an oil change, lol.
770 2018-03-08 22:15:47 It was fine. This was in Canada, with a couple of seriously big V8s. Cheaper, of course, cleaner burn, so oil doesn't get dirty, really easy to tune. I suspect over here on small engines the much cheapness factor will be less, but still worth it if you do high miles. Probably...
771 2018-03-08 22:15:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps banana with 2 tablespoons eggplant. Mix into  Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve

783 2018-03-08 22:14:05 @walmarthelp one of your stores did my car wrong today!  High reving a car right after a oil change and then saying that’s standard procedure?  Are you kidding me!?!
784 2018-03-08 22:13:56 They can't contend with oil money backed behemoths like goats and alpacas
785 2018-03-08 22:13:47 water and coconut oil
786 2018-03-08 22:13:35 You have the temerity to post this, while you attack our oil industry? #hypocrite
787 2018-03-08 22:13:34 We already saw the first one - I believe it was the Presidents retweet of the Drudge comment on American Oil - I don't think all the booms represent arrests or judicial matters.  North Korea is a huge.  Sessions having an outside prosecutor looking into FISA abuse is a another.
788 2018-03-08 22:13:13 You can get a firmer grip, and it is easier to oil up
789 2018-03-08 22:13:07 When you get an oil change they’re supposed to do it if needed or have a boy do it 
790 2018-03-08 22:13:07 I’m coated up in lavender oil so I’m hoping I sleep better tonight! Does anyone have any other Natural tricks for a good night sleep??
791 2018-03-08 22:12:56 You’re going to have a hard time selling your pain to Albertans our oil also has one of the Lowest carbon footprints & you don’t give a shit
792 2018-03-08 22:12:43 @EdVoylesHonda really disappointed. Called yesterday for an appt for an oil change at 4:45 today. Was told by someone I definitely didn’t need an appt and I’d be in and out. Not the case. Who specifically do I need to talk to to ensure I can get what I need?
793 2018-03-08 22:12:25 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, #mining, aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
794 2018-03-08 22:12:16 Man, the post-chemo alchemy I had to perform to get mine to grow in AT ALL was hella time consuming. Castor oil, minoxidil and a shrine to Brook Shields. Kinda wish 1920s pencil thin brows would make a comeback.
795 2018-03-08 22:11:55 My perspective is that as long as consumption creates demand, a business will exist to fill it. Anti-pipeline lobbyists are attempting to scuttle the oil businesses meeting demand *while global oil demand rises*. The demand is simply fulfilled by another source.
796 2018-03-08 22:11:47 Haa if my Mummy should catch you ehn
You better call it anointing oil
797 2018-03-08 22:11:43 I wish I could do my own oil change lmao

805 2018-03-08 22:10:34 If they were you’d see pipelines carrying oil. They also donated to Hitlery’s campaign.
806 2018-03-08 22:10:32 People underestimate the value of these fishing ground, they are a national asset and must not be traded away again. We can rebuild fish stocks and the industry again. Think of it as a oil well that never runs out if you look after it.

821 2018-03-08 22:08:19 In five years we will be the leader of oil exports.  Why not drill offshore Sen Harris?  My opinion the more middle class jobs we create, the less people we have in the underclass.

Take people out of the underclass and liberal elite's like you Senator are no longer needed.  MAGA
822 2018-03-08 22:08:16 there was mct oil in my coffee today, and i low key thought I could take on the world up until about 3:30pm.

824 2018-03-08 22:08:01 I got a car on PCP because I wanted something "low hassle" but because the local dealers couldn't find their arse with both hands I have to drive all the way to nottingham to pay £200 for a YTS lad to change the oil.

857 2018-03-08 22:03:51 The UK had their first coal free day a few months ago, and are now going to phase out oil in exchange for wind and solar power, but america still makes charcoal like you're in the early 60s

859 2018-03-08 22:03:44 I've been telling my gf, I don't understand why I crave pizza all the time! I just burped and had an epiphany. I've been taking oregano oil caps during cold and flu season. 
860 2018-03-08 22:03:40 I provide motivation to the black community in much the same way that an oil spill provides motivation to sea otters.

865 2018-03-08 22:02:59 When it comes to using oil in your hair, there's a one drop difference between red carpet ready and oh sweet god it's 7th grade all over again.

877 2018-03-08 22:02:02 It’s due to price of oil/gas in the market. Notice how we’ve got more money now that the price has been up over $60 for extended period. NDP stated they would start paying down debt in next budget if prices stay the same. What will your reason be when Kenney can’t lay down debt?
878 2018-03-08 22:01:44 I wanna say it’s the black seed oil girl. But i don’t eat half as much as i used to
879 2018-03-08 22:01:36 Lurvvv how I look like a cherry tomato  take my advice, don’t put watermelon oil on your face in the sun 
880 2018-03-08 22:01:29 You are saying LA, MS and AL don't have resources? Almost nobody drills more oil and have more related jobs than they do. But their priorities are corporations and not it's people
881 2018-03-08 22:01:15 to all the marvelous LADIES who COOK   here's a tip....try grape seed oil
to cook with instead of always using OLIVE OIL   - great tasting
happy ladies day
882 2018-03-08 22:01:14 Is there any evidence AT ALL that the sun is moving to a Grand Solar Minimum like Dalton or Maunder minimum Paul? Snake oil sellers are saying it is and some are spending money they cannot afford in preparing for a “mini ice age.”

891 2018-03-08 22:00:20 We need @Hinchtown and @robertwickens to give us a FaceBook Live tour of it....
892 2018-03-08 22:00:08 Since it's #InternationalWomensDay @Kia gave me 10% and $10 off of my oil change and tire rotation 
893 2018-03-08 22:00:06 So the fact that those countries were already deserts before oil was being extracted has no relevance, ok
894 2018-03-08 21:59:59 Nah. Every oil on the planet irritates yo head!
895 2018-03-08 21:59:58 صح ولله ،، والاسعار أيه؟ لا انزله بكره مخصوص
896 2018-03-08 21:59:56 I think these days are definitely drawing us closer to God. There's too much hate and negativity around us. It makes me feel like a duck that landed in an oil spill. We need God to wash all the muck off of us. Our joy and peace comes from Him.
897 2018-03-08 21:59:42 Even the oil I have isn’t as bad tasting as that
898 2018-03-08 21:59:40 A month and a half. All I applied was castor oil every night before bed.
899 2018-03-08 21:59:32 Yes. I must agree. The shelled fishes are dubbed roaches of the sea to some. They eat everything that falls to the bottom (rotten flesh, poop, oil) where they live. The book of Leviticus warns about shelled fish. Highly cancerous eating fish that eat mercury and oil.
900 2018-03-08 21:59:27 Tony your facial construction looks like the way that the word olive oil sounds
901 2018-03-08 21:59:23 my fav essential oil these days is Gasolina
902 2018-03-08 21:59:21 Trump: We will go to Narnia and take the oil.
903 2018-03-08 21:59:19 Replace “vodka” with “oil” and I fully agree
904 2018-03-08 21:59:14 Yea I know I’m saying they bought into all that DARE shit. The real reason it’s illegal is that it’s a cure for a lot. And it’s not as profitable as say, chemotherapy to cure cancer. CBD oil is proven to help children w seizures. But it’s highly illegal for NO REASON.
905 2018-03-08 21:59:01 i dont know how but all the people i follow who attend GW have some poetic tweets and those make my day
906 2018-03-08 21:58:56 Whatever Obama did, didn't have much an affect on Russia.
You what would hurt Putin? Remember when Putin threatened to turn off Russian gas and oil to Europe? That was when Obama should have turned our spigots on for them to get them out of trouble. He did no such thing.
907 2018-03-08 21:58:55 Lavender oil is your best friend for calmness too, girlfriend!

909 2018-03-08 21:58:20 How? if it’s oil?
910 2018-03-08 21:58:01 Banning offshore oil drilling isn’t really a conservative issue. 
911 2018-03-08 21:57:52 You mean I don't have to oil up?
912 2018-03-08 21:57:43 Paano mo alam lasa ng efficascent oil bro 
913 2018-03-08 21:57:21 Turn off the taps for oil & gas & see how fast things change for the energy industry
914 2018-03-08 21:57:17 Catherine...do not include me in anything that AL Gore is involved with! He is a hypocrite thief that lobby's against Canada's Oil and Gas Industry...an industry that millions of Canadians are proud of.
915 2018-03-08 21:57:10 As some companies isolate constituents from the whole herb or only deliver a certain fraction, New Chapter differentiates by extracting the whole herb. Full-Spectrum means that we deliver both the water & oil soluble constituents of the whole herb. Feel free to call: 888-874-4461
916 2018-03-08 21:56:52 Duh.  It's not just the oil change obviously I stated I was tired of a car.
917 2018-03-08 21:56:41 Pictures don’t make facts. No idea why you’re showing me this picture when it comes without any factual support. 

I would also like to see evidence that the Koch Bros. have stopped buying Canadian oil (if in fact they are buying it).
918 2018-03-08 21:56:41 Beard food and castor oil!
919 2018-03-08 21:56:36 He hasn't grown up since he was governor; still owned by the oil people.
920 2018-03-08 21:56:34 Oil
921 2018-03-08 21:56:20 I wanna say it’s the black seed oil but what if it isn’t 
922 2018-03-08 21:56:20 Blasphemy!
This is anointing oil. No controversy

924 2018-03-08 21:56:06 I gotta stop going out to dinner with white folks ... this the third time where someone has said the olive oil is spicy! They legit warned me y'all that it "sneaks up on ya"
925 2018-03-08 21:56:04 Get some eucalyptus oil, pour some into a bowl of bowling water and stick your face over it with your head covered with a towel! It helps!
926 2018-03-08 21:56:03 Watch out w coconut oil around your eyes I know people get dry eye reactions
927 2018-03-08 21:55:57 if you have wood floors in your home YOU NEED MURPHY OIL SOAP GO GET IT NOWWWWW
928 2018-03-08 21:55:40 I’ve been waiting to get my oil changed for a hour 
929 2018-03-08 21:55:35 Engine oil and gummy bears!
930 2018-03-08 21:55:33 Zinke is a waste of time to tweet to. He's in Trumps pockets too deep. As much of a crook as the others, and he's all into oil & export oil. Would be interesting to find out how he might be tied to the N. Arctic oil drilling and the exporting oil battle (to take place in future)
931 2018-03-08 21:55:21 I had to pay for a new car battery and oil change instead of new running shoes 

Is this growing up? Because I don’t wanna anymore
932 2018-03-08 21:55:16 Castor Oil 
933 2018-03-08 21:55:13 Oil is a curse!
934 2018-03-08 21:55:11 Never forget sophmore year of college I was moving in and my dad prayed an anointed me with holy oil outside Heathman in front of everyone
935 2018-03-08 21:55:01 Cadillac grills Cadillac mill's, check out the oil my Cadillac spills
936 2018-03-08 21:54:59 What do you expect when It’s made from ground elephant tusks, blood from deported undocumented people and oil extracted from national monuments.
937 2018-03-08 21:54:32 My daughter's!!! She makes the best popcorn!! Salt and olive oil!!

939 2018-03-08 21:54:26 I accidentally packed the cord for my electronic oil diffuser instead of my phone charger guess ill just fuck myself then
940 2018-03-08 21:54:12 i just switched back from oil pens!! i missed the actual feelingof smoking something i rolled if that makes sense
941 2018-03-08 21:54:02 @kenjilopezalt  so let's say I accidentally didn't label canola oil that I'm pretty sure has been used to fry...something...   AND then it gets used in baking to make cookies... Okay, or... not...? haha
942 2018-03-08 21:53:52 He wanted to get out of oil, but apparently still wanted the roller coaster of raw commodity markets.
943 2018-03-08 21:53:48 Hola! Acabo de comprar este aceite seco pero quisiera saber si sirve para el rostro, me puede dar resultados iguales al Skin Therapy Oil (rostro) . Mil gracias espero le puedan responder!

946 2018-03-08 21:53:11 No, and I am not a Creighton fan either.....not till they fire the coach who recruited this jackass.
947 2018-03-08 21:53:07 Yes we have a homemade column for our synthetic crude oil which collects  the fractions simultaneously. Tech is loathed to put that mix in quickfit as difficult to clean the column, but we might give it a go
948 2018-03-08 21:52:58 Just wait, in our house we use pure chili flakes in oil to spice our food haha

950 2018-03-08 21:52:55 Maunder Minimum brought 0.3°C cooling. Wow—that is almost nothing! Solar activity was not that low, in  other words. Jeez, if you have to quote JoNova you must be desperate for content Dave!

Pure snake oil.
951 2018-03-08 21:52:52 What most don't realize, and it's not getting any news coverage, is there's a battle over oil exports between N. Arctic countries, which includes Russia who is ahead of USA. I didn't realize Canada joined in. I'll research this next. This oil export is Trumps retirement fund.
952 2018-03-08 21:52:52 FYI Dog owners- if your dog gets duck tape stuck on their paw... pour olive oil over it and it's comes off pain free!
953 2018-03-08 21:52:46 I need an oil change .

I want my jeep.
954 2018-03-08 21:52:35 An address, light pole number or GPS coordinate will do just fine with that breadfruit oil down thanks.
955 2018-03-08 21:52:20 A decent white truffle oil will do. It'll save me snuffling about out of town for bottle 
956 2018-03-08 21:52:20 look at who gains
Israel has possession of the Syrian gholin heights oil reserves
it refuses to return them/thus it needs Russia helping Syria to look bad
so send the mossad 6 to uk to make rusia look bad 
think about it
957 2018-03-08 21:52:12 Add 5 quarts of motor oil and a midget and we’ve got a fetish flick!!!
958 2018-03-08 21:52:09 Yeah, that one looks punchy, although I wouldn’t bank on too much discipline if your oil price forecast turns out to be right
959 2018-03-08 21:52:04 I just bought castor oil!!!! Being bald ?? I don't know that bitch !!
960 2018-03-08 21:51:53 Creighton Marcus Foster must have fixed this game.  Nobody in Div 1 can be that bad.  Truly sucks.  Horrible.  Pathetic.  I mean he is really really bad.  Who is the jackass who recruited him?  They should be fired.  Providence Friars

962 2018-03-08 21:51:39 Those folks won’t number enough to stop the extension, but the ones concerned about the sea will. If this becomes about oil tankers and oil spills the extension will never be built. If it’s about keeping it here in North America there’s hope!

971 2018-03-08 21:50:29 Your country would collapse into chaos if the arabs decided to not sell oil to you anymore

989 2018-03-08 21:48:06 In winter my skin gets dry and products marketed to men don't help. I switched to the fancy shower oil marketed to women and it just works. The weird part is, no matter how flowery it smells, I still have a traditionally masculine smell when I get out. Clean, but masculine. Odd.

1004 2018-03-08 21:46:25 did I just get an oil change AND smog check for $30 bux?... ahhh yeah, bitches... #Hendo Nevada FTW.. 
1005 2018-03-08 21:46:21 Oil helps it break down. So, lotion. Facial creams etc.
1006 2018-03-08 21:46:16 Sigh...

And debate gets childish. 

Alberta is unique in the fact that it’s economy has powered this nation for over 50 years. If that truth bothers you, then that’s your problem, not mine. 

Follow the price of oil, and compare it to the value of CAN$.
1007 2018-03-08 21:46:05 I keep finding grams of oil everywhere. In my pocket. In my makeup. Outside on the bannister. Anyone else have luck like this?
1008 2018-03-08 21:46:01 i don’t have oil on mine or alcohol BC I HAVE OILY SKIN
1009 2018-03-08 21:45:48 There is no GSM so how can it intensify? A GSM might, at worst, cause 0.3°C cooling. Wheat harvests have been fine, Australian wheat harvest last year, despite WARM winter, was 2% above average.

Pure snake oil.
1010 2018-03-08 21:45:25 I’f you stomak hurts just put hot oil on it
1011 2018-03-08 21:45:22 You comments are false and miss leading designer to provide foreign and countries organizations to benefit at Canada’s expense. Exporting Canadian oil is about economic benefit to Canada and its families.
1012 2018-03-08 21:45:19 Listening to 50 Cent. This is how you burn the midnight oil.
1013 2018-03-08 21:45:09 ARAMCO  is rescheduling its IPO into 2019. I think they are anticipating lower Oil prices for some time.
1014 2018-03-08 21:45:07 Wow nice!  
1015 2018-03-08 21:45:05 If we want action on climate change, not more endless delays, we should have a position that can be supported by a broad coalition, including the AB NDP and the federal Liberals. To me, that means the rising carbon price floor, while continuing to ship AB oil.
1016 2018-03-08 21:44:44 Catherine: I want to know, do you really believe this climate change snake oil you’re selling or are you just saying what your puppet masters tell you to?
1017 2018-03-08 21:44:41 It is the reason that the US will never be serious about alternative energy.  It is the reason both parties kiss ass to the Saudis.  It is the reason that any country that threatens to use another currency to trade oil (the largest commodity trade in play) gets attacked.
1018 2018-03-08 21:44:40 I bought and selected a sachet of indomie yesterday to cook and there was no seasoning in it. I selected another one randomly tonight to cook, no seasoning again. Are u people sure ur Q.C manager hasn't secured an oil company job? @IndomieNigeria
1019 2018-03-08 21:44:25 He looks like a tumble weed who went thru an oil spill
1020 2018-03-08 21:44:09 “Where you from?” 

“Saudi Arabia ” 

"Oo from the Middle East" 

"Well yeah , technically western Asia"

“Cool... so do you like it here, living in the city and the lights? It's pretty different huh?” 

“Desert ! I live in the desert with camels and drink oil when thirsty"
1021 2018-03-08 21:43:21 Hmmm. But I found an easier that keeps it like new.
Boil hot water and liquid or powdered soap, removes oil and smells fresh
1022 2018-03-08 21:43:20 There is no GSM in the offing. IF we did have a GSM temperatures would cool by 0.3°C compared to 1.2°C of warming.

Pure snake oil.

1025 2018-03-08 21:43:11 @CaseyCagle, saw where all the coastal states sent a "hell no" when trump said Fla would be exempt from oil drilling. I noticed Georgia doesn't care about its coastline. Not a word about the danger offshore drilling is. Do you even care about tourism?

1030 2018-03-08 21:42:30 @davisjsn that’s said, The biggest problem I have with the new logo is that it Looks like the logo of an oil company.

1032 2018-03-08 21:42:22 Just a minor point, if all the rats are eating is lard (non hydrogenated) and coconut oil they likely wont gain any weight at all. They may end up with a better muscle/fat ratio.

1057 2018-03-08 21:38:55 4) They BS ppl with hoaxes abt global warming, dirty coal & oil, etc, but in reality they want to keep USA from thriving by killing those industries & jobs.  What was the purpose of Obama using Obamacare to tax employers & turn 40-hr work week into 30 hrs? Who was helped by that?
1058 2018-03-08 21:38:42 Thanks for the comments.  On backing; I say that is bad because in the regime PR they constantly say the Petro is "backed by oil" but when you dig in to the few official docs available, it becomes clear that it is not actually backed by oil - so lying is bad.
1059 2018-03-08 21:38:37 What exactly do you do with the oil? I've fibro and I've tried the vape oil but  I find it very strong on my throat so I don't smoke it all the time. Would love to give the oil a try.

1146 2018-03-08 21:24:39 Clearly you've never been a soldier, worked on a North Sea oil rig, spent your working days down a mine, worked in the building trade in winter, motorway maintenance is a pretty dangerous job......trust me, being a parent is not the hardest job in the world.

1153 2018-03-08 21:23:28 Perhaps he's decided he doesn't really want a 2nd term, but instead of bowing out wants @GOP to promote another to run in 2020 so he can blame them. All that USA oil will be ready to export by 2020 - his retirement fund.

1162 2018-03-08 21:22:30 No, the eco crowd is concerned with increased oil tanker traffic and increased spill risk. Clearly there’s a greater demand here, addressing high prices and supply issues without risking the coast or putting any of the extra supply in oil tankers for export to Asia.

1175 2018-03-08 21:20:00 Venezuela got into trouble because the socialists put all their eggs into oil and gas - 50% of GDP. Canada is only 9% (including mining and quarrying). Who wanted to make Canada a petrostate? Harper. It's not the socialists you should worry about.

1203 2018-03-08 21:16:28 As I can not speak as a layman I can not understand. She goes after big pharma which I agree with but helps many snake oil sellers or gives them credibility when they deserve none. The healthcare system in the USA is a disgrace on that I totally agree. So does Bernie.
1204 2018-03-08 21:16:18 But financially we’re there now, and it took a long a time. I’m saying spurs won’t have that calibre post new stadium, especially when you look at their current wage model. No sponsorship changes that, to get around that you need oil money.
1205 2018-03-08 21:16:10 The price of oil falling as the US imposed sanctions together scared investors and hurt the ruble. There's not really a housing crisis, but due to the resulting financial crisis many people don't have money to spend, or are unwilling to spend it, and the cost of food has risen.
1206 2018-03-08 21:16:08 Also where did you get this big oil idea? He came out against fracking very early. When he was union organizing. Huh?
1207 2018-03-08 21:16:01 She's certainly overdue for an oil change and a tire rotation.

1284 2018-03-08 21:06:11 The economy is booming and unemployment in 2018 is projected to hit the lowest rate in history! With POTUS at the helm, America is projected to be the largest oil EXPORTER by 2023. His accomplishments are amazing. He will need 8 years to drain the swamp and MAGA.

They just Need a Good Spanking and Caster Oil.
1286 2018-03-08 21:06:00 much better, now I must ask, would you like some of my special snake oil?

100% pure, straight from the source, the snake
1287 2018-03-08 21:05:25 Sounds like a study for effects lard and coconut oil has on feminist.

1290 2018-03-08 21:05:11 Nigeria's saving grace its the Niger Delta oil. 
The Niger Delta is the only reason why a Nigeria still exists. #NigeriaIsAShithole
1291 2018-03-08 21:04:58 Pretty simple, time consuming but if you get everything prepped ahead of time, makes things a lot easier. The hardest part I'd say is cooking. You have to make sure your oil isn't too hot/hot enough. They only take about a minute to cook. I 100% recommend the use of a thermometer
1292 2018-03-08 21:04:43 This @BenefitBeauty pore-fessional primer is the BOMB! I thought I'd never find a primer that would hold my oil at Bay but I finally found it 
1293 2018-03-08 21:04:31 It's not about the oil. It's the New North Pole. The illuminati were a conspiracy theory how long ago?
1294 2018-03-08 21:04:25 Seal oil (from boiling seal fat)
1295 2018-03-08 21:03:35 @SecretaryZinke is off his fucking rocker wanting the @Interior to partner with oil companies. That defeats the entire purpose of the Interior.

1296 2018-03-08 21:03:32 Coconut oil
1297 2018-03-08 21:03:29 Nah, it's just fine off the plate (although I did think about pulling the tortillas out of the fridge too). Red pepper in the frying oil turned up the spice plenty, although some good salsa on top would have been money.
1298 2018-03-08 21:03:29 Syria has hardly any oil. Before the war, it was like the 50th top producer in the world. The USA has been in Syria since 2014 -- it began during the Kobani siege -- to fight ISIS in an alliance with the YPG. Why? Because Turkey did nothing to help fight ISIS.
1299 2018-03-08 21:03:26 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and look like a Slate pitch: critics say Trump will be a terrible president, here's how
1300 2018-03-08 21:03:24 Love how good my hair feels using Moroccanoil Moroccan Oil Treatment...
1301 2018-03-08 21:03:21 Another win for gas and oil.
1302 2018-03-08 21:03:20 So what you're saying is there are car accidents each year, so increasing the traffic of oil tankers off the coast of BC is fine? That's a child's argument. 

(ps - it's spelled incident..)
1303 2018-03-08 21:03:19 I realized today that I only own 1 (one) pair of pants without oil stains on them.
1304 2018-03-08 21:03:16 Criminal con-man Trump's steel and aluminum tariff charade is the exact same kind of scam he pulled on the poor souls who work in the coal industry. Like a carnival barking snake oil salesman, Trump preys upon desperation and ignorance — he always has and he always will.
1305 2018-03-08 21:03:13 I think I use more baby oil and baby lotion on myself than anyone does on their kid lmao

1307 2018-03-08 21:02:57 Let’s see what happens this year.  Might be just what the United States needs, and have fair trade. US oil companies are selling the heck out of their oil to other countries, but we have test to see our gas prices go down. No outcry from you or others.
1308 2018-03-08 21:02:38 They will but as I’ve been saying Angola and Brazzaville enjoyed huge fiscal revenue growth when oil was booming for almost a decade did it help them? It actually hurt those countries fiscal position as they borrowed and wasted lots of $$$
1309 2018-03-08 21:02:31 I don't know the area at work too well and not at home. I don't have olive oil or panko, do I'm not making it. Maybe I'll get frozen stuff and save myself money, time and trouble! Should just go to Costco.
1310 2018-03-08 21:02:30 The Earth's core naturally produces Petroleum. 
Oil's actual price per barrel should be less than $10.
The Derivatives Market is set to EXPLODE if itdrops below $46
LockheedMartin could WTF crush NK, ISIS, TALIBAN
if it was actually directed to do so.
The Truth is a lonely place
1311 2018-03-08 21:02:16 The Con Man In Chief is at it again with his snake oil salesman routine what a complete Joke!  Quick photo op to fool the gullible wow sad!!
1312 2018-03-08 21:02:15 So his line is I don’t get it my meeting in some far off place with a sanctioned Russian after the election has nothing to do with aiding the con in the very thing Russia wants  oil and other sanctions related to oil/ mining operations he really is not too bright
1313 2018-03-08 21:02:11 Russian agriculture what a joke. The funny thing is we’re going to be the largest supplier of oil that really hurts Russia do some investigating on that

1317 2018-03-08 21:01:37 It’s super simple all you need is a good infused oil and a blender and you’re set
1318 2018-03-08 21:01:36 So what was #Daesh stealing and selling , fresh air?
Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region
1319 2018-03-08 21:01:31 Had they recommended eating raw paper or drinking castor oil? 

Or maybe jumping?
1320 2018-03-08 21:01:28 Of course, this extends to people’s livelihoods affected by not being able to get the oil to world market. Your view wouldn’t  be a one dimensional viewpoint, would it?
1321 2018-03-08 21:01:27 @KatyTurNBC its ridiculous that steel industry, oil industry or coal industry gets all this special attention. these people who cant find work cuz the company shut down.. go back to school, do what everyone else has to do when they lose their job, retrain or re-educate urself
1322 2018-03-08 21:01:11 It’s 1928. A lady is always above reproach, she knows her place. But things can change. Pasadena Rose Queen/oil heiress Violet Conrad learns that it isn’t always easy to recognize the good guys. So many secrets, someone could die. #PitMad #A #WF

1334 2018-03-08 21:00:25 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1335 2018-03-08 21:00:21 i get heartburn (and worse) from shitty garbage seed oils -- like canola and soybean.

don't assume your pizza (unless from a great place) was made with olive oil.

1340 2018-03-08 20:59:48 He already did. Paid back in interest. Now let’s ask the oil & gas giants, along with the bailed out auto companies to do the same.

1347 2018-03-08 20:58:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1348 2018-03-08 20:58:26 In the pot of oil??  Like frying it!?!  Isn’t that still a hard shell taco?
1349 2018-03-08 20:58:23 It's really good for boils, acne, cysts and the like. It encourages drainage and is a strong disinfectant, antiviral, anti inflammatory agent. But it's really dangerous. Google "oregano oil burns".
1350 2018-03-08 20:58:12 several yrs back was a vote on ending the $300,000,000 subsidy CO gave to oil companies (that's $ out of our paychecks btw).  Oil co ran ads saying ending it was a "tax", & it lost.  Cities also passed regs against fracking & CO state sued the cities. GOP owned in CO by oil & Nra

"Trump and his administration want to repeal the Obama-era ban on offshore drilling, opening more than 90% of the U.S. coastline to oil and gas leasing, including the remote Arctic." @DAILYKOS
1360 2018-03-08 20:56:53 The silence of your colleagues across the aisle is deafening right now. The oil overlords keeping them safe and sheltered? 7% is where it should be.
1361 2018-03-08 20:56:47 Rosehip oil! It has vitamins A and C and it’s supposed to promote skin cell renewal, lighten sun spots, acne scars and reduce appearance of wrinkles
1362 2018-03-08 20:56:39 You brain would be better with ketogenic fats like olive oil coconut oil fish oils . Carbs don't help the brain  like you think .
1363 2018-03-08 20:56:33 Russia is fighting & defeating Western funded terrorist groups in Syria
West sanctions them, as they want to oust Assad for the oil & a pipeline

So whilst we self-destruct because of our Governments actions, Russia has no need to help as it did in WW2 as we are an island

1368 2018-03-08 20:56:03 I spilled olive oil on myself, had to uber downtown for a work call on my off day, learned that I got waitlisted for both programs I applied to, and I have to consider finding work for the next year bc it’s not likely I’ll get into either of those programs

Ecclesiastes 9:8 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.
1372 2018-03-08 20:55:29 It's not bad olive oil. It's not fancy pants, artesianal olive oil but it's totally serviceable. It's way better than a lot of the other oils at that price point.
1373 2018-03-08 20:55:20 Yeah but i blew out the engine forgot to do oil changes 
1374 2018-03-08 20:55:19 I’m about to take a nap while I’m sitting here waiting on my oil change.

1379 2018-03-08 20:54:48 How? Ask yourself why your country has to buy Steel and soft lumber and oil from other countries...because you don't have enough of your own natural resources any more. Not enough for 330 million people.
1380 2018-03-08 20:54:36 I'll gladly show how oil companies will use crooked lawyers, (even family),  and crooked tactics to steal land and mineral rights.  Colorado's future water in obsolete areas is being sacrificed for fracking.

1382 2018-03-08 20:54:30 48: Try switching your washer from "Hot" to "Warm." If everyone in the US did this, it could save ~100,000 barrels of oil a day!
1383 2018-03-08 20:54:28 If you can't get good olive oil, fly to Tuscany, buy your self a villa in the Lazio region near Rome, raise your own olive groves. Harvest them.  Cure them. Press them in an antique olive press.  Voila. Isn't that easy.  Good olive oil.
1384 2018-03-08 20:54:08 From a Flames fan...Edm's press is brutal...they were too hard on Hall, Eberle & Shultz...too much negative in the name of selling papers. Each of these guys is doing fine no thx to Oil mgmt.
1385 2018-03-08 20:54:03 Longest oil change ever.....
1386 2018-03-08 20:53:59 Probably I should write a book on: The seven of everything in oil!  Like the seven wise men and the seven technologies and the seven oil basins.. and the seven oil states.. 
1387 2018-03-08 20:53:59 Sign #358024 that I'm getting old: Ripe tomatoes with salt, pepper and a tiny dab of Greek olive oil leftover from summer is about the best thing I've eaten all year.
1388 2018-03-08 20:53:58 I don't like the diarrhea that comes from the oil they use...
1389 2018-03-08 20:53:53 Reasons for Pueblo’s Steel industry troubles decline:

- Cheap imported steel
- Oil and gas production decline
- Automation (produce more with less workers)
1390 2018-03-08 20:53:46 @AmbJohnBolton ~In any conflict w/Asia, imports from China stop. US mil complex is kaput w/out a US steel industry. US loses conflicts w/ no planes, ships, etc being built. No one likes tarrif issues w/Asia, BUT US steel/oil industry is a military backbone. Talk about that on TV!
1391 2018-03-08 20:53:34 It is! A lot of the characters have oil company name tie-ins. You've reminded me that I need to sit down and watch Dinosaurs as an adult.
1392 2018-03-08 20:53:26 It was about to happen when some oil junkie tries to tell you that he believes in global warming but he has a better way to fixing it  #cdnpoli #climatechange
1393 2018-03-08 20:53:24 it sounds like something she might say when she's surprised--not "goodness gracious!" but "good olive oil, jeffrey! the belt slipped off your bathrobe!"
1394 2018-03-08 20:53:13 But the pendulum swung too far and we need to keep capacity here as well. It isn't like oil where we stop drilling and then when we decide to go back at it we become one of the  largest producers of oil and not dependent. Metal industry not that easy to ramp back up
1395 2018-03-08 20:53:10 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1396 2018-03-08 20:53:02 Oh hello Troye, I see you in those oil slick pants 
1397 2018-03-08 20:53:00 We won tonight coz @Arsenal won its not like we r like u guys @ChelseaFC who'd support @LCFC  right after #EPL winning season jus coz ur shit team wasn't performing like u losers wanted to that particular year. We r beyond that we have more class than ur Russian oil money can buy
1398 2018-03-08 20:52:59 And, on top of tax cuts, look at how ISIS has been decimated in Iraq and Syria. Look at how the US is on its way to being the #1 oil producer in the world.
1399 2018-03-08 20:52:47 Same why The Netherlands did it: unsubstantiated feeling of guilt. And fear of being cut off the oil supply from Saudi Arabia.
1400 2018-03-08 20:52:46 Lol beard oil
1401 2018-03-08 20:52:44 i like how they specify EXACTLY three lines of caramel. 

like if it arrives with four lines i'll be like "YOU INCOMPETENT FOOLS! FIRE THE SOUS-CHEF AND HAVE THE HEAD PATISSIERE DEEP-FRIED IN PEANUT OIL! I'LL DEMOLISH THE RESTAURANT LATER!"
1402 2018-03-08 20:52:40 US oil companies like Kinder Morgan lol
1403 2018-03-08 20:52:39 Read your history. A voluntary tanker exclusion zone has existed in CDN waters for nearly 3 decades. It's 100km from the coast. There are no tankers passing through the inside passage from Alaska to Washington state. 30 years ago we recognized the risk of an oil spill.
1404 2018-03-08 20:52:35 El de Cadiz pierde oil #firstdates580
1405 2018-03-08 20:52:32 Use red oil
1406 2018-03-08 20:52:30 How much?
1407 2018-03-08 20:52:26 Can I get tea tree oil in shop rite
1408 2018-03-08 20:52:26 great tip! I'm under a lot of pressure here to give nutella so if I cave in - I can add coconut oil. Brilliant thanks #sugarchat
1409 2018-03-08 20:52:16 From what I understand the old lines are being kept. The new lines are for oil transport to Westridge Marine Terminal, where ships will have to navigate narrow Burrard Inlet to go to Asia. That's asking for accidents on land and sea
1410 2018-03-08 20:52:16 Got an oil change yesterday and the dudes were cracking on me like “you got that single woman oil” and “I can tell you ain’t got no man” lmaoooo  okay fuck y’all
1411 2018-03-08 20:52:06 One day I wanna be as chill and independently wealthy as Ina Garten. I will have all the dinner parties and serve the most delicious food made with good olive oil and homemade stocks lol
1412 2018-03-08 20:52:03 What's oregano oil supposed to do, in general?

1414 2018-03-08 20:51:56 The last time a middle eastern guy cut my hair he also put beard oil in my beard and I smelled vibrant for hours.
1415 2018-03-08 20:51:39 When I find the cheapest bottle of olive oil at Walmart, I exclaim “Oh, good!” and put it in my cart.

I assume that’s what she meant.
1416 2018-03-08 20:51:19 Tara ands has always been used up until ~10yrs ago when CAPP,  foreign owned oil producers and CONs spent 100’s of millions in their “oil sands” rebranding campaign.
1417 2018-03-08 20:50:36 Not oil tankers.

1420 2018-03-08 20:49:54 I just walked in on my dad drunk make brownies in his boxers so I checked them and he put 1 1/2 cups of oil not just a 1/2 cup 
1421 2018-03-08 20:49:53 Alex didn’t tell me I had pomegranate juice on my face so I called him out on it. He denied seeing it and then less than 20 seconds later the egg he was frying spat oil into his face. His reaction was “don’t you thank your mother for that”. #HappyInternationalWomansDay
1422 2018-03-08 20:49:47 And that's the news from East Hampton, where all the pancetta is diced, all the thyme leaves are fresh, and all the olive oil is above average. 
1423 2018-03-08 20:49:47 She likes olive oil from California
1424 2018-03-08 20:49:39 We try to stick to rice crispies only for cereal and not every day. My son loves Nutella on toast too. I add coconut oil first so I can just add a little slither. Makes it much easier to spread so less used #sugarchat

1436 2018-03-08 20:48:36 So vague that both "drunk" and "reading mind altering books by the light of the midnight oil" would have fit.
1437 2018-03-08 20:48:32 You and I know it, but that ain't the narrative. Bottom line is Hezbolla is being cored out by the GCC and there will be peace in the ME in 2 years. SA will be a recognized world power for their technology sector rather than oil reserves. The world is changing for the better.

1442 2018-03-08 20:48:00 Not to mention  oil and LNG would help Climate change because our product is produced better than the market it’s going to.  Climate change is world wide. If ours go up a bit and another county goes way down, then I would except that. 200 new coal mines firing up in Asia soon
1443 2018-03-08 20:47:50 “For it sayeth in the book of J’oil, the black guck in the ground, be it wet or dry, hot or cold, smelly or sweet is the divine guck of our Lord, he didst shoot it out of his nose into the earth and it is holy. Though it maketh you sick too bad, Exxon needeth more profits, Amen”.
1444 2018-03-08 20:47:48 He threatens us  whom you trade for most of your imported Steel. Guess we'll just send our steel to other countries that want it, plus all our soft lumber & our electricity, our oil too. Don't piss on Canada, you need our natural resouces.

1448 2018-03-08 20:47:27 Smoking Ferrari engines, from the photos I’ve seen definitely more smoke than how much has been seen from Mercedes at getaway in the past from their oil burning
1449 2018-03-08 20:47:26 Just started watching 'Occupied' on Netflix. From Norway. Climate change forces Norway to stop fossil fuel production. EU and Russia says not so fast, we need oil. Russia turns the spigot back on after Occupying. @expatina @SCJoson @PaintsNature

1453 2018-03-08 20:47:10 #الكوميدي_كلوب we have no oil any more
1454 2018-03-08 20:47:08 Yam and palm oil 
1455 2018-03-08 20:46:59 The public has clearly indicated that they don't want the tax burden placed on them. We want oil and gas to pay their fair share!!
1456 2018-03-08 20:46:51 eggs scrambled in olive oil + salt and pepper + medium chunky salsa + dairy free mozzarella cheese. fucking lunch of champions. I’d take a pic but I already demolished it
1457 2018-03-08 20:46:39 And they have a lot of oil
1458 2018-03-08 20:46:35 That's because of all the Montanans in ND working in the oil fields.
1459 2018-03-08 20:46:25 Oil, gas industry secures tariff request to be able to apply for "exclusion of specific products" not met by domestic production. The US Department of Commerce will manage.
1460 2018-03-08 20:46:24 your dad was clearly a superhero. Snake oil vendors and woo merchants drive me insane for the sheer disrespect they show to people like your dad.

1465 2018-03-08 20:46:01 This Articles must be read. Tides Foundation helped Trudeau win. Tides Foundation is anti-Canadian oil.
1466 2018-03-08 20:45:52 We subsidize Farms. We subsidize Oil. Why not SUBSIDIZE steel @realDonaldTrump ?

1468 2018-03-08 20:45:50 @realDonaldTrump puts tariffs on steel and aluminum. 

Texans get hurt. 

Drilling equipment costs more.
Cattle equipment costs more.
Aircraft manufacturing costs more.
Oil and NG production costs more.

1469 2018-03-08 20:45:42 Because governments subsidise the big oil agenda to extend oil infrastructure, even at a time when alternatives are available.

1472 2018-03-08 20:45:11 Why didnt trump specify American steel in the oil pipeline? @AliVelshi
1473 2018-03-08 20:45:04 The fact that the Venezuelan government resorts to it as a source of financing at a time when its income has fallen due to low production and the reduction of oil prices, the main and almost only source of foreign currency to the country.
1474 2018-03-08 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1475 2018-03-08 20:44:46 Financial incentives need to be restructured. Your research confirms liars make more ad money today. Also social network companies make more money enabling liars lie lies. All social network companies should be held responsible for raking profits from snake oil sales. All of them
1476 2018-03-08 20:44:43 If companies can make more money selling their product abroad, that money can be used for new technology to make it more Enviro Friendly. The company I work for postponed a research project due to the low dollar for our oil going to the US (OUR ONLY MARKET).

1501 2018-03-08 20:41:45 Heartbreaking. The GOP has been eliminating ALL science from every branch of government. What hope do we have when they’re willing to destroy National Parks for oil?

1505 2018-03-08 20:41:10 I find this article somewhat disturbing because it focusses mostly on the marketing appeal of a food.  Coconut oil should be out of favour because it's just not that good for you, not because it's had it's 15 mins of fame.
1506 2018-03-08 20:41:08 not these they tasted like old fry oil and shattered dreams. For a second I was like “maybe she’s one of us?” because of just HOW bad they were but then she negged on paczki so nah

1509 2018-03-08 20:40:56 Absolutely, I've thought the same thing. It's something I hope that interviews with folks who saw Dinoland can get at--how did affection for oil/oil culture (via dinosaurs) evolve/persist during oil crisis? Especially b/c these kids would be getting their licenses during the 70s.

For the cough mix liquorice powder (you can get from an Indian grocery) with warm water and honey works a treat. My mum also massaged my joints with warm mustard oil mixed with cloves. Indian remedies work 
1519 2018-03-08 20:39:48 Peep me wearing it in my verification vid. It’s my favorite because I can eat whatever I want and not worry about losing product (I can’t be like drinking oil tho lmaoo) and (for me at least) it does not crack once dried

1532 2018-03-08 20:38:29 Good practice maybe, but using an ethically uncleared questionnaire to discover patient preference is a de facto crime against humanity FFS. Ethics panels don't make snake oil, secrecy and unethical behaviour do.

•Fuel prices r same as dat in 2014 wen cost of crude oil was thrice?
•Fuel & Liquor exepted from GST?
•4 GST slabs while u opposed it on highest of 18%?

1554 2018-03-08 20:35:02 My all time favourite book is Lightsource by Bari Wood. It's about a female physicist, with no social skills, who finds a way to make cheap fusion energy. So of course, the oil companies want her dead!  #InternationalWomensDay
1555 2018-03-08 20:34:55 Ethics, we need stronger ethics - Check @bengoldacre Bad Pharma, all trials, etc. Strong ethics make for effective clinical research, poor ethics and ethical lapses give you snake oil, as is happening with loosened rules in US
1556 2018-03-08 20:34:41 Hybrids been my thing since Volkswagen put that BlueMotion technology out. Ya'll keep thinking making oil companies rich is cool, I'm over here thinking where the hydro-electric cars at?
1557 2018-03-08 20:34:41 Looking for someone to produce some packaging for my beard oil bottles.   Get in touch. #printers #packaging
1558 2018-03-08 20:34:39 Really miss using organic coconut oil in my hair 
1559 2018-03-08 20:34:12 Because people hate everything #oil.

$etp should be at $27
1560 2018-03-08 20:34:11 @ChessTrades Like the looks of VLO here.. has consolidated big run, trying to recapture 50dma.. can be independent of oil price.
1561 2018-03-08 20:34:05 My thoughts, ideas & solutions on social issues were my true from the heart beliefs, not some sort of fantasy dreamland. I was very fair with all of my thoughts & I applied common sense to each issue. I didn't agree with all Liberal views. I'm for transporting oil via pipelines.
1562 2018-03-08 20:33:54 Name calling? 300 years old union and we are doing ok. We don't speak German and thanks to no voters Scotland is not bankrupt (remember that £8bn oil revenue Salmond said we'd get?) As for straight answers where are yours on currency? EU membership? Hard border? Nope just more 
1563 2018-03-08 20:33:49 Awe hell na, it was Evening Prime Rose oil she was supposed to take! I actually did just that with my second child! Lol and it worked for me!
1564 2018-03-08 20:33:30 Lol, u need enough oil so the Amara can swim in it..
1565 2018-03-08 20:33:14 This would set the table for Middle East nuclear power plant program (built & overseen by US & Russian entities) to flourish, at a time when ME wealth thru oil is waning. Russia+Syria would contain Iran.  But then Russia gamed Trump w/ new US destabilization & spying efforts-Evil
1566 2018-03-08 20:32:53 You're spot on sir. We cannot compete with places like China who pay their workers rock bottom salaries. We need to start reviving our steel industry. We tried it their way and it doesnt benefit America or our workers. Just like oil, we need to become self reliant again.
1567 2018-03-08 20:32:51 It's #InternationalWomensDay
Rub her down in baby oil and drip hot wax along her spine just to show you appreciate her....
1568 2018-03-08 20:32:37 the other day it was cannabis oil; today it's how your body is too acid if you've got cancer *throws things*
1569 2018-03-08 20:32:34 Interesting... Would like to see the euro correlation to gold and to oil as well.
1570 2018-03-08 20:32:27 fresh oil change and 2 new tires from the other day. gotta keep the whip in shape 
1571 2018-03-08 20:32:09 Albertans should be pressing their govt and oil companies to build more refineries not pipelines. Feed our own.
1572 2018-03-08 20:32:08 Looked at an apartment, got my oil changed and got to see my boo thang. Today’s been productive 
1573 2018-03-08 20:31:58 I know clove is a good antiseptic for cuts and serves as an anti-fungal. I've had some nightmare situations with essential oils (looking at you, oregano oil), but never had a problem with clove on my skin. Sometimes I use hemp oil as a carrier, which is very soothing.
1574 2018-03-08 20:31:43 because oil spills don't kill birds?
1575 2018-03-08 20:31:32 see him shilling “Fake News” against ANY study (which he ALREADY DOES for a myriad of more important issues) and what made you think video games would be excluded? He’s a snake oil salesman & a politician, his business are all in disputes or failures, he has a million lawsuits-
1576 2018-03-08 20:31:26 Yeah I like that Bc I don't like being dewy af so it was the perf amount for me. It just looked like natural radiance your skin would naturally have Idk but I definitely wouldn't suggest it for oily skin unless MAYBE there's an oil controlling primer under it
1577 2018-03-08 20:31:23 $DNR 50 dollar $oil was the catalyst that sent this over 4.00 last. Funny is all. Profitable company
1578 2018-03-08 20:31:18 virgin coconut oil !!!!!
1579 2018-03-08 20:31:04 You know you're getting old when you REALLY want an oil diffuser for your birthday 
1580 2018-03-08 20:30:52 Tell all those people that tot Niger delta was a war zone that I am laughing at them, the oil companies brought along their problems with them to lagos. Tell the Yoruba and it's itsekiri allies that it is in the pigment not in Niger delta.#singingbobmarley
1581 2018-03-08 20:30:49 OIL DIFF: 3.66 -> 3.69
1582 2018-03-08 20:30:31 So Adamu Tsadu is your class mate
1583 2018-03-08 20:30:28 Regularly remove and clean chokes, lightly grease or oil thread before refitting and tightening. The same holds for rifle moderators.
1584 2018-03-08 20:30:25 Highlight of my day: Waiting to get my oil changed at the dealer bc I met the cutest couple... married for 63 years!! She said when she saw him she said “That’s my man! And I got him!”

1586 2018-03-08 20:30:11 Another nice take from @JKempEnergy on #Aramco #OOTT #OPEC #OIL 

"The parallels between the last shale boom and the current surge are uncomfortably close, and the bad news for OPEC does not stop there." 

He suggests Aramco IPO situation is getting in the way of OPEC outlook.
1587 2018-03-08 20:29:55 Oil firm ceasing operations, leaving thousands of untended Alberta wells
1588 2018-03-08 20:29:55 lord i need a oil change before I not have a car I’ve never took this long
1589 2018-03-08 20:29:43 I’ll oil u up n drop u DOWN *down, down, down*
1590 2018-03-08 20:29:40 Uh huh. You mean train folks on how to mine coal, build off shore oil rigs and manufacture guns right?
1591 2018-03-08 20:29:40 That's the crazy part, even many of them think it's real, and suggest things like raising oil platform levels to prepare for rising sea levels. A conspiracy that implicates >90% of the academic community and even oil company scientists is too big to be believable for me.
1592 2018-03-08 20:29:34 A pompous bully is what he was. Atwal would have been more credible without the snake oil salesman.
1593 2018-03-08 20:29:20 Yeah, it is a bit of a double-edged sword, isn't it? Novelty is good, but running out of a finite resource is bad.  It's too bad in a way that it ends before the 70s oil crisis because it would have been interesting to see how Sinclair handled it.
1594 2018-03-08 20:29:00 Rest, chicken soup, lots of vitamins, oregano oil, and (trust me on this one) a good saline nasal rinse. Squeeze bottle one is best.
1595 2018-03-08 20:28:43 Coconut oil is the answer to all my problems
1596 2018-03-08 20:28:39 ไม่เคยไม่เจอหน้ากันนานขนาดนี้เลย

3. Salicylic-mehhh
1598 2018-03-08 20:28:29 water based? 
looks like it paints like water but the colors are thick like oil

a dream  !!
1599 2018-03-08 20:28:17 Have not heard 1 mention anywhere of Obama steel tariffs. What happened to them?
1600 2018-03-08 20:27:58 Light Cycle Oil (LCO) as half the fuel blend? You'd want to check the metals content of that, its just been through an FCC unit a few times. Biofuels, batteries, and hydrogen-based fuels only game in town that can get us to net zero CO2 emissions as we need to
1601 2018-03-08 20:27:53 my oil changes really be $70+ cause my car only takes synthetic oil
1602 2018-03-08 20:27:42 My client want me to fry her chicken with butter  why girl ? .. can I just use oil 
1603 2018-03-08 20:27:37 I do! I did oil remover first,  then liquid remover @Elemis @influenstervox #FeedYourSkin #contest
1604 2018-03-08 20:27:35 #AfricaFacts: Equatorial Guinea, with a population of only 1.221 million, is Africa's fourth largest producer of oil, yet 75% of its citizens live in poverty. It has been ran by President Obiang (who overthrew his uncle) since 1979, whose son, Teodoro is his Vice President.
1605 2018-03-08 20:27:26 Killing people for oil ? Why not just understand that the future is renewable ? Expecting foreign aids ? Why not foster relationship with other african nations? Abusing little girls and making child soldiers ? Why not build a real education (coding, etc) for the future ? #africa
1606 2018-03-08 20:27:25 ไม่น่าทิ้งเค้าให้อยู่กันสองคนเลย
1607 2018-03-08 20:27:20 It can’t, but AB needs  to support renewables so we’re not caught in the oil market price game OPEC plays.
1608 2018-03-08 20:27:20 . Sure you did. I have noticed that all your "paintings" has diamond pattern shape texture which is impossible with oil paintings. But enjoy your little FAME, I mean app
1609 2018-03-08 20:27:15 Yeah and there’s zero chance I believe anything said by the oil company “scientists”.
1610 2018-03-08 20:27:15 A cat that does eat oranges?! You are a special girl!! My sister eat appels, but I don't do that eater, blergghh!! Keesje would probably eat coconut oil, but you can't trick me into doing that. I only like the cheapest, unhealthy, full with horrible ingredients cat food 
1611 2018-03-08 20:27:13 Bet when he was a baby his mom put oil crude in his bottle in place of milk. #TXdrinkofchoice
1612 2018-03-08 20:27:02 Nobody was more profitable for private sector oil producers than Mr. Trump's predecessor.  
1613 2018-03-08 20:27:01 call me stupid and you’d be right bc every time I get an oil change idk how to pop my hood and I have to ask the car guy so happy #InternationalWomensDay to me
1614 2018-03-08 20:26:44 I need about 3 days of sleep, a bronzed tan, the finest coconut oil & sun 
1615 2018-03-08 20:26:40 มีกันอยู่แค่นี้เอง
1616 2018-03-08 20:26:38 When the oil filter arrives before the head gasket kit.
1617 2018-03-08 20:26:30 Perhaps when one one can trust their counterparty, the China-Texas spread in oil will be 80%. But today is not that day.
1618 2018-03-08 20:26:23 It says he's lived there 29 years, so foreigner. Japan has strict naming rules, so Gunter would be impossible. Actually not even accurately representable in Japanese phonology.

It's the notion of a Japanese oil magnate that has me laughing the hardest.
1619 2018-03-08 20:25:57 You know who may know alot of info on palm oil @righttospeak3 They speak up & know alot about everything corrupted!
1620 2018-03-08 20:25:49 Rub oil on the yam... Then eat
1621 2018-03-08 20:25:37 to the Premier, a fundraiser for the Premier said that by signing on to oil and gas from the B.C. Liberal record. The member for West 3/4
1622 2018-03-08 20:25:29 This is very different from your usual stuff. Did you get a check from big oil?
1623 2018-03-08 20:25:13 I've been thinking about Venezuela this week. It's hard to imagine how bad things are there - and @TheEconomist recently reported that oil workers are passing out from lack of calories, which means it's going to get even worse.

And there are some noteworthy parallels to the U.S.
1624 2018-03-08 20:24:51 I’m big on oil pulling too. First thing in the morning. Spit in the bin.
1625 2018-03-08 20:24:42 อยากจะขอโทษเป็นหมื่นครั้งที่ทำให้เหงา
1626 2018-03-08 20:24:36 New technologies need a supply of refined crude oil.  
We are now exporting LNG and crude oil to the countries that are ahead of us.
Not bad for cavemen.  #MAGA
1627 2018-03-08 20:24:27 ima cry if i don’t find it before the oil spill
1628 2018-03-08 20:24:08 The thing is, we’re not meant to eat much of it in any great quantity anyway. The food industry encourages us to eat the same ingredients all the time, because it’s better for their profits - hence prevalence of wheat, sugar, veg oil & dairy.
1629 2018-03-08 20:24:05 Yes, Calif represents the Future; question is "What type of future?". If one looks at cost of repairing highways, cost of water for coming drought, cost of govt litigation to stop oil drilling in Calif so other states can continue destroying their lands,
1630 2018-03-08 20:24:03 I've been reading on this oil for a while now and it's horrible. I've experienced some of the side effects of it such as anemia. Luckily and by the grace of God nothing to drastic. My thing is if canola oil was so great and healthy, it wouldn't be in everything!
1631 2018-03-08 20:24:03 sesame oil is so good tbh
1632 2018-03-08 20:23:35 Can hear the glugging oil now,if you got it right you can refill mini oil by quickly turning can upside down and it fills itself,just right amount for A-series 
1633 2018-03-08 20:23:30 Are you selling like badam oil , chillax JK
1634 2018-03-08 20:23:30 Equatorial Guinea, with a population of only 1.221 million, is Africa's fourth largest producer of oil, yet 75% of its citizens live in poverty. It has been ran by President Obiang (who overthrew his uncle) since 1979, whose son, Teodoro is his Vice President.

1636 2018-03-08 20:23:22 I’d call theft the privatisation of common land via the Enclosure Acts in England. I’d call theft Argentinian waters being granted exclusively to Spanish fishing boats. I’d call theft oil companies historically being given a monopoly on oil extraction. In every instance...
1637 2018-03-08 20:23:21 Thank you! With butter or oil or not at all?
1638 2018-03-08 20:23:17 Chairman

1647 2018-03-08 20:21:25 Meanwhile, the #LiarInChief ordered removal protection of federal lands so his cabal of oligarchs can mine riches like uranium, oil.  How far would @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenMajLdr go to enrich themselves & bankrupt America, making like Russia? Vast right-wing conspiracy, 'eh?
1648 2018-03-08 20:21:21 1) Cernovich retweeted Weinstein’s tweet, which in this case implies endorsement of its message

2) Cernovich is an Alt-Right charlatan & snake oil salesman incapable of any original, critical thought

3) There is zero “common ground” to be had with the Alt-Right

4) You’re incel

1655 2018-03-08 20:20:08 I was contacted by this imposter too, Steve.  Told me he was Martin Hansen - an oil and mineral investor who was all alone in the world.  I was suspicious right from the off when he claimed to be 58!
1656 2018-03-08 20:19:53 There isn't one really but basically roast squash & cherry tomatoes, heat some garlic & chilli in a little olive oil, toss it together w/ spaghetti then crumble in the feta with basil leaves spinach is a good addition too
1657 2018-03-08 20:19:52 Any fiscal model that depends on the price of oil or natural gas to keep our provincial finances in order isn’t sustainable. The day will come when nobody will want or need those resources - we should be preparing for that day now.
1658 2018-03-08 20:19:47 Well it's not that simple, they also go there for oil, for ego, for cash, some are psychopathic, some defend the country, or women or children, but it mostly starts for religion or assets.
1659 2018-03-08 20:19:45 Ooooohh!!  Will you be stocking decent truffle oil?  :D
1660 2018-03-08 20:19:38 #Oil exports from #Angola are slumping & #IEA says aging fields + lack of interest from foreign investors mean the worst is yet to come. Shipments from the #OPEC state will average 1.52 MMbopd in the January-April period.
1661 2018-03-08 20:19:13 I remember the round tins with the removable foil strip and two holes, as well. The oil glopped out in a very satisfactory way, although if you weren’t using a funnel, the first glop was hit and miss 
1662 2018-03-08 20:19:06 tfw you see someone you used to work with and liked a lot constantly posting the worst kind of snake oil and bollocks about cancer on Facebook *sigh*
1663 2018-03-08 20:19:04 OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo asserts that the oil cartel’s ongoing efforts to limit global crude production, along w/ 11 non- #OPEC countries, could serve as a long-term strategy to reduce boom-and-bust #oil prices

1666 2018-03-08 20:18:57 British Govt is ti build prison in Nigeria so as to deport and imprison thousands of Nigerians from Britain. #CrimeOfBritish. British created Nigeria just for interest of oil not the people. They said the amalgamation is like oil and water. Shame to them.
@crimesofbrits
1667 2018-03-08 20:18:56 Even if I believed that was a thing, which I don't, where does climate change factor into this? How does exporting oil to foreign markets help the average citizen who is forced to live with the risk of these pipelines and shipping traffic?

1670 2018-03-08 20:18:31 @RichardEngel 2/ Lorenzo's oil,  StemEnhance & Willard's Water. Deeply read thoroughly about each to open your mind to the nontraditional answers. Your answer may or may not be there, it is to open your mind to a YES you can defeat doctors horrible diagnosis.
1671 2018-03-08 20:18:30 you might prefer less raw seeds, but it gives the salad beautiful texture and taste. if you're doing seeds, you don't necessarily want or need any oil since youre getting the full fat from the raw seeds. up to you lovelies!
1672 2018-03-08 20:18:20 (2/...who IMHO make no pretence of not having an "America first" agenda, even if they are Americans, which obviously is not always the case.

I've probably called OPEC a globalist oil cartel, for example, which is hardly Jewish, nor do I believe they're controlled by Jews.
1673 2018-03-08 20:18:08 I can’t wait for the Patreon #WYATR After Dark specials exposing the seedy underbelly of Bach-podcasting, where @ArdenMyrin and @erinfoleycomic have Letterman/Leno style beef, Rob and Paget are trapped in the studio basement, and Anna is an evil oil heiress pulling the strings
1674 2018-03-08 20:17:52 Productive week! Just sent off revised article w/ colleague from @Arctic_Centre on #oil #pollution and #wastedumping in the #Arctic #Ocean.
1675 2018-03-08 20:17:49 I have no vested intrest in the oil sands. 
I do have a vested intrest in our provincial economy,  as those of us that all work and live here. 
No, I do not have a job in the oil and gas industry.
1676 2018-03-08 20:17:47 I can never just get a simple oil change and service. Something always is wrong with my car and I end up paying 300 plus dollars and sitting around for hours
1677 2018-03-08 20:17:35 FWIW I've always had problems with dry scalp/greasy hair until recently - swapped to Herbal Essences Golden Moringa Oil S+C. IDK if that helps but yeah.

1683 2018-03-08 20:17:00 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for BDSPs (bee-derived skincare products), and put some benzene essential oil in my diffuser.

1686 2018-03-08 20:16:36 The important thing here, is to shock people who don’t realize how many ash oil shooting have been this year and to get action on gun control. Not sure why, of all things, people want to harp on terminology.
1687 2018-03-08 20:16:35 Only reasons to put those anywhere in a garage would be: 

A.) Throw darts at  

B.) Change the oil over (concrete protection) her face could scare a drip in the pan!

1703 2018-03-08 20:15:02 I sing in the car on the way to gigs. For vocal care I just drink tons of water, chamomille tea, oregano oil, and a mix of vitamins. But for me the best practice is songs. Plan your setlist as well. I try not to start with anything too vocally demanding.

OIL！
1714 2018-03-08 20:13:24 the Murumuru Butter & Rose one sounds lovely but Argan Oil & Lavender would be better for my hair type. I would love to try any of them tho!
1715 2018-03-08 20:13:23 So so aggetiated, would like my face clear up and bio oil to stop seeping into my eye balls
1716 2018-03-08 20:13:18 Noooo, no clove oil on skin!  Lavender oil in a carrier oil for skin.
1717 2018-03-08 20:13:16 Can we sub the oil for something else with liquid/moisture content? Maybe mashed sweet potato or similar?
1718 2018-03-08 20:13:14 If your governments, whether Labour or Conservative, would spend less taxpayer or borrowed money on destroying other nations to serve private oil and arms interests, they could invest more in creating a fair society with better education and opportunities.
1719 2018-03-08 20:13:13 How can I tan my legs without them ending up looking red/orange? This is a serious question y’all, give me some advice, I’ve already try tanning oil and stuff like that cause my legs are white y’all, like Casper white 
1720 2018-03-08 20:13:05 My dog is 13 yrs old and has arthritis. I give her Charlotte’s Web CBD oil and it helps her out tremendously. It calms her, she rest better, and it helps her get around a lot easier. I also buy their products for myself and they are amazing....an overall feeling of wellbeing!!
1721 2018-03-08 20:13:00 oil change time!
1722 2018-03-08 20:12:50 You could be right. I would rather pay more for foods with good ingredients & maybe have less of it. I would also love to know when palm oil started to be put into our foods.
1723 2018-03-08 20:12:46 so should I put tea tree oil on my face?
1724 2018-03-08 20:12:45 Come to handa for an oil change and find out someone scrapped the front of my car  #fuckyou #whoeveryouare

1728 2018-03-08 20:12:19 You won’t ever buy oil again save money and taste great great investment
1729 2018-03-08 20:12:14 Wage freeze isn't real wage roll-back. Yes, perhaps won't keep up with inflation, but if we keep expecting oil to shoot up to $100 again to balance the books, we're deluded. It isn't happening. Without serious fiscal attention, we're going to end up in an interest expense spiral
1730 2018-03-08 20:12:01 So much shit happened that weekend bro  we literally lived in the parking lot of Lucas oil stadium for a few days
1731 2018-03-08 20:11:57 This also doesn't address the impacts of expanding oil sands operations on climate change, or increased shipping traffic and the likelihood of an offshore spill. Unless you have a vested and personal financial interest in the oil industry, how are any of these factors acceptable?

1737 2018-03-08 20:11:10 Ladies would you recommend magnolia oil?
1738 2018-03-08 20:10:58 No. It’s up when women go down a coal mine, or work on an oil rig. Playing 5 sets at Wimbledon, doesn’t cut it!
1739 2018-03-08 20:10:38 Also, we don't have good evidence of the health of ancient humans, so it's maybe not a good benchmark.

I'd describe the SAD diet as a high fat one, although it also does have lots of refined carbs. The oil and animal products makes it lean more towards high fat in my opinion.
1740 2018-03-08 20:10:33 Let me create the Tweet for Oil and Gas.
1741 2018-03-08 20:10:30 Transport oil by rail and BC wouldn't bat an eyelash
1742 2018-03-08 20:10:28 I think you're missing my point, but ultimately what you're saying is that as long as oil spills anywhere other than BC, it's fine? These companies have a proven track record of negligence and cutting corners whenever possible.
1743 2018-03-08 20:10:23 R. Kelly notices his gardener is having trouble starting the lawnmower, so he decides to go help the guy out.... He comes fresh out the kitchen, hands the guy a can of motor oil, and says you've got to premix for ignition.

1750 2018-03-08 20:09:16 @realDonaldTrump  We need the infrastructure fixed more than we need oil  Stop offshore and National parks drilling and fix our roads.

1755 2018-03-08 20:08:42 According the dentist that first told me about the magic of cloves, the best was to use them for toothaches is to make a little pouch out of gauze filled with them, and stick that on the ouching area. I wonder if the oil is useful on skin and stuff.

1800 2018-03-08 20:03:51 Oh indeed! Essentially the message went--oil is older than these dinosaurs & that makes it good. I'm not aware of other co's using extinct animals to sell petroleum (as brand/logo differentiation was extremely important) but companies did use dynamic animals, eg Esso/Exxon tiger

1802 2018-03-08 20:03:30 No, destroying the earth, contaminating our water sources, forcefully removing Native Americans from their sacred lands, running oil pipelines in the arctic, polluting our oceans, seizing power of oil rich countries, and allowing frmr head of EXXON as Sec of State.

1809 2018-03-08 20:02:56 “Ahhh. My mistake.”

Artoria no. Read the box. No don’t oil the pan. Why.
1810 2018-03-08 20:02:40 Sounds familiar. Off shore oil drilling authorized - unless states negotiate exclusions.
1811 2018-03-08 20:02:38 Avocado, eggs, coconut oil, olive oil, nuts in moderate quantity, bacon, coconut flour and flaxseed flour to bake things that have crunch to them(what I missed most from the carb zone), cheeses, cauliflower can be made to resemble rice. Keto diet was a big help when I had cancer.
1812 2018-03-08 20:02:28 Because laying waste to the planet  for oil is so Godly
1813 2018-03-08 20:02:28 Now you are talking I remember over filling the dif on the vitesse. The oil ran down my arm,I couldn't get rid of the smell for days. 
1814 2018-03-08 20:02:16 Cbd shouldn’t make you feel high honey. You most likely bought an oil that has some thc in it. Always have to read the bottles

1830 2018-03-08 20:00:20 There’s a certain amount of palm oil I’ll see in a dish and I just won’t eat it. 
1831 2018-03-08 20:00:14 @liamdenning Just me, or isn't there also a bit of a disconnect between the narrative about new levels of capital discipline for the frackers, and raising US tight oil growth forecast to 2 mb/d for 2018?
1832 2018-03-08 20:00:14 OIL DIFF: 3.63 -> 3.66
1833 2018-03-08 20:00:08 One day when I’m married it’s gonna be hubby’s job to get the oil changed in my car bc dang it every time I go they ask me questions I have no clue what they’re talking about and I look like an idiot every time 
1834 2018-03-08 19:59:56 The power that Big Oil has; they turn jibbering fools into even bigger jibbering fools.
1835 2018-03-08 19:59:52 So, I’m sitting and waiting for my car’s oil to be changed and this lady next to me is eating her homemade lunch while doing crossroads, talk about multitasking and making the best of your time at car service. #HappyInternationalWomensDay 
1836 2018-03-08 19:59:49 No oooo, use palm oil
1837 2018-03-08 19:59:42 Lmao first he tried hitting on me and then told me about his life and then told me that you would marry me and then we talked about social issues and then finally gave me the damn essential oil I wanted  at least he was smart tho
1838 2018-03-08 19:59:27 Right but some of these others are just the same. Selling snake oil which has no therapeutic benefit over medicine which has been proved to help. When you work in a free healthcare system as I do, you see what a scam both are.
1839 2018-03-08 19:59:20 Do u think oil is in the same scenario? Trapping shorts?

1844 2018-03-08 19:58:54 Chop it for a salad then massage w hemp seed or olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder and pink salt to taste. I add bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and celery periodically as well. It’s especially good w avocado 
1845 2018-03-08 19:58:47 Getting my oil changed before I leave. When I come back I’m going to the beach 
1846 2018-03-08 19:58:33 Now i gotta get baby dove lotion , shampoo , oil EVERYTHING 
1847 2018-03-08 19:58:20 Amend that to say worldwide rights and you have me. For years they gave a pass to Japan over women's rights, the same with Saudi Arabia. Worlds premier supplier of oil!
1848 2018-03-08 19:58:11 is not commanded from Ankara(Turkey), the orders and decisions come from Incirlik(Turkey) where the NATO base is. Even countrys like Saudi Arabia and UAE were in that base and "fought" against ISIS. In reallity they traded oil from ISIS against weapons to overthrow Assad.
1849 2018-03-08 19:58:02 To start with BC doesn't buy that much Alberta beef. Easy to offset that. Secondly people can easily cope with no steak, they can't cope with no gas to get anywhere. Big difference. Oil is the lifeblood of society. As of now there's no way people survive without it.
1850 2018-03-08 19:57:52 Without historical oil/gas revenues, there is no credible economic case for independence. The hardcore who want Indy at ANY cost have always been there - the informed 'converts' who know the game's a bogey are, as you say, in denial & reliant on fake news.
1851 2018-03-08 19:57:30 What has this got to do with NDP. It all started under Tories who were in bed with big and small oil!
1852 2018-03-08 19:57:24 Oil is not gonna save Economy. Good luck thinking that.
1853 2018-03-08 19:57:15 Going to get my oil change is a really big anxiety inducing activity for me, but every time I go to 5 minute oil the guys are always SO nice and my anxiety ends up going away.
1854 2018-03-08 19:56:52 Well class fields were made to work with ASI, but the problem is that adding new syntax increasingly has higher risks of adding ASI hazards. Kind of like using up natural resources such as oil, we are using up grammar productions. Even have blurbs about significant whitespace
1855 2018-03-08 19:56:46 all i have used on my skin for a week now is pure jojoba oil and all of my issues caused by Cerave have almost cleared!
1856 2018-03-08 19:56:45 This guy really just told me not to wear this oil around my boyfriend or else he’s gonna wanna get me pregnant...good businessman? Lol? 

I bought it.
1857 2018-03-08 19:56:37 1. The budget consists of 69.2% recurrent and 30.8% capital expenditure with far less than 50% implementation 2. "Foreign reserves" figure partly consists $5.5b borrowed Eurobond and capital importation by speculative portfolio investors 3. Crude oil price has doubled since 2015.
1858 2018-03-08 19:56:33 Bout to finish mine but find it only good when its damp my hair. Have you used the miracle olive oil leave in before?
1859 2018-03-08 19:56:27 Fine then Rick, you do not expect to profit when you give to a church so sell the oil at cost, better yet sell at a loss and make it up with taxes.
1860 2018-03-08 19:56:19 Travel routes make no sense on a glove, but are almost straight lines on a flat polar protection map. I grew up around the oil fields, they don't give two shakes about any "curvature." Navigation is only accurate with flat charts, they don't plot courses around any "curvature."
1861 2018-03-08 19:56:18 Made this spinach leaf and arugula salad with olive oil,salt & pepper dressing + chicken. I feel like a million bucks now, so good
1862 2018-03-08 19:56:13 Right, because god wants you to drill for oil.
1863 2018-03-08 19:56:11 Has the oil started generating revenues or it is still work in progress
1864 2018-03-08 19:56:07 And much too much recycled motor oil.
1865 2018-03-08 19:56:07 What does it take to get a oil change n Peoria gessshh
1866 2018-03-08 19:56:01 Your award is very well deserved. You provide an excellent British product and avoid many food miles in the process.
In addition to other functions I regularly use your oil to make mayonnaise. It raises this and its derivative sauces to new heights. Excellent flavour and colour.
1867 2018-03-08 19:55:50 Well oil beef hooked!!
1868 2018-03-08 19:55:16 When your man tells you the weed oil came  bisshhhhhh I’m too excited for this.
1869 2018-03-08 19:55:01 I have postponed my Dad changing my oil 5 times now Bc I simply just don’t feel like driving all the way to Harlem 
1870 2018-03-08 19:54:58 Like i said i'm not here to answer to all your theories you got from blogs and social media. Come with facts and i will change my mind. I'm not turkish but kurdish and able to speak turkish. To the oil transport from ISIS to NATO thorugh Turkey.

1872 2018-03-08 19:54:17 just checked All commodity food prices...sugar...corn..wheat..etc  are down..Oil soft..Big employers only allocating 15% of tax savings to employees. Conclusion..jobs up but inflation in check
1873 2018-03-08 19:53:55 And I assume Sinclair was connecting the prehistoric character of oil with dinosaurs? Did any other oil companies attempt this kind of marketing?
1874 2018-03-08 19:53:14 Oil closed and $SPX ripped higher
1875 2018-03-08 19:53:13 We were a basket case up until the 80's despite membership of the EU. The game changer was Thatcher's reforms financed by North Sea oil revenues. We never looked back
1876 2018-03-08 19:53:12 Have you also tried coconut oil?  I take coconut oil to help absorb turmeric, brain function, hold off Alzheimer's/dementia etc.

1879 2018-03-08 19:52:09 True hope & true peace is the original that copies & false versions can never match.
They're called to bring enough oil for light & be diligent in search for truth & make themselves blemishless & let God do the rest. That takes action not laziness.
1880 2018-03-08 19:52:04 I don't quite understand how you want to try and remove the wool over people's eyes by hanging up new wool. You don't know the future price of anything and neither do I really. Tell me what's a barrel of oil going to be worth in 5 years.
1881 2018-03-08 19:51:45 ngl $14.99 is actually a great deal for an oil change
1882 2018-03-08 19:51:30 ISIS-Propaganda can be bought UP TO TODAY in TURKEY!
Do you get it NOW?

And the supply routes were cut by SDF, by the Russians, and finaly by SAA.
Bilal erdogan made BILLIONS with cheap syrian oil, stolen by isis.
1883 2018-03-08 19:51:23 I feel so bad for the girls that come to school or just go out in general with their hair all crusty. Dead ends looking all dry or all gross and oily. Homegirl trim your hair, put some argon oil ! Something!
1884 2018-03-08 19:51:22 i’ve been waiting 3 hours for an oil change, i could have learned how to change my oil during this time !!!!
1885 2018-03-08 19:51:18 アクション久し振りにやったけど、以外と良くできた！剣の残像は色々試してみたけど、しっくりきたのが剣は実線でその上にブラシ重ねるのがリアルに見えてよかった、残像風に見せるのはコツが分からなくて失敗した( ;´･ω･`)
1886 2018-03-08 19:51:17 Ironies of life in the so called "largest non conventional #oil reserve in the world, #Venezuela, lack of cars on the main national roads and highways due to lack of motor oil and the high prices of them if you get to find them... #oott
1887 2018-03-08 19:51:14 If we're going to time travel back to the paleolithic, they also didn't have avocados, olive oil, cream, butter, ghee, chocolate, coconut oil, or modern bacon ... to name just a few.
1888 2018-03-08 19:51:11 Oil change  car wash  pedicure  full tank 
1889 2018-03-08 19:51:10 Whoops! How did they let that happen? Pruitt let some renewable energy sources into OKLAHOMA.  Big oil companies are going to be upset. Gas companies will frack away. Baby steps.

1891 2018-03-08 19:51:08 Thanks Karen, our support group is extra vigilant (as is @spelfabet) and wants to make sure parents don’t waste their hard earned $ in unscientific, ineffective methods. So much snake oil out there!
1892 2018-03-08 19:51:07 bought really nice olive oil from italy and I love it so much! Get excited just opening the bottle, using small amounts of it on bread and stuff
1893 2018-03-08 19:51:05 Aw thank you love I really appreciate it  I’ve been trying to sell these oil paintings for a while so I’m just at a loss and am beyond ready to part with them

1897 2018-03-08 19:50:20 Oil prices settle at a more than 3-week low
1898 2018-03-08 19:50:02 国内のみの名称のようなのでその線なのかなぁ？と自分も思っていました。ただ日本専売のようなイメージをつけるのはMOBIL1的にどうなんだろ、という感じも。
あと単なる名称の付加かと思ったら0w-40が無印とJの2つになるというリプも貰いましたので、そうなると何かよく分かんないですね。

1902 2018-03-08 19:49:29 Oh no! Ignore me if not helpful but when I had this and painkillers weren’t enough, clove bud oil from a health shop was great. Tastes so gross and bitter but numbs it really quickly

1908 2018-03-08 19:49:01 Yep, scared. That’s why he armed Ukraine. That’s why Tomahawks response in Syria. That’s why killing Russian mercs in Syria. That’s why fostering US as #1 oil producer. That’s why reinvigorating NATO defense spending / posture. That’s why building smaller tactical nukes. Scared.
1909 2018-03-08 19:48:41 Lol. You know gas tax doesn’t pay for healthcare, right? It’s not just taxes, it’s also the way we let oil companies price gauge us that’s not possible in US.
1910 2018-03-08 19:48:40 But do they really cook in ghee ? Their sports and fitness may not allow them to consume much ghee and oil.
1911 2018-03-08 19:48:03 If that's not enough, even though it was a new pipeline built by a Canadian-based company, what of the Saskatchewan pipeline spill that spilled 200,000L of oil last year?

1916 2018-03-08 19:47:17 have we all just decided that prior to iphones we went around doing oil portraits?
1917 2018-03-08 19:47:14 I got $10 off my oil change / car wash because the guy doing my oil change said I was a dime. 
1918 2018-03-08 19:46:56 Who knew drive through mechanics were a real thing? Like I got my oil changed in 10 minutes
1919 2018-03-08 19:46:49 And lest we forget OH WHAT VULNS SO MUCH FAIL - their software is basically trash, snake oil - should be considered harmful...
1920 2018-03-08 19:46:46 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1921 2018-03-08 19:46:45 means longs exiting their positions in loss. Buyers would be in panic , I think open loses control of keeping oil above 60. We gonna see sub 55 in a month.

1923 2018-03-08 19:46:27 What a pile of bs it’s our oil.

The high reached $61.40
The low reached $59.95
1925 2018-03-08 19:46:14 Don’t forget The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Blackwater Security, Science Applications International Co, Halliburton, Boeing, Northrop-Grumman, Lake City Ammunition, & basically any private defense/banking/oil company. The list of direct profiteers goes on forever.
1926 2018-03-08 19:46:14 FACT: Lip biting is a verb that refers to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.

1931 2018-03-08 19:45:04 #OOTT | Economic optimism and oil consumption go hand-in-hand, therefore, any adverse impact on the health of the global economy will dampen oil demand growth prospects. A trade war would be a recipe for lower oil prices. cc. @PVMonline #WTI $DJIA $SPX
1932 2018-03-08 19:44:50 In CBB live gramercy show 4 of 6 you described it having the thinnest crust in the world but also somehow having the most amount of oil in the world. But that wasn't you that was sam elliot i guess!
1933 2018-03-08 19:44:27 Saving for reference what all I just put into these amazing eggs: milk, salt, greek yogurt, cheddar, gorgonzola, soy sauce, sesame oil, small handful of jasmine rice, sausage, pepper. These are the best eggs I've ever had in my life.
1934 2018-03-08 19:44:22 The 3% of scientists who trade research and data for funding from oil companies, to then produce as much misinformation as the carbon emissions that are killing our biosphere, are a disgrace to Life and Truth.

1948 2018-03-08 19:42:31 Mexico’s oil exports to USA are higher since Russia investigation began & Congress passed Sanctions Bill—as are exports of US oil & natural gas by foreign companies in USA. 

Mexico & China have far more influence than Russia on US elections/pols/media/economy/energy/food, etc.

1950 2018-03-08 19:42:18 Catholics are quite primitive. They still believe in a god for the answers that science gives them. They attempt to persecute anyone who doesn't agree with them, and even some that do (Muslims & Jews) Now you're saying that the oil under the Persian Gulf was given to the natives?
1951 2018-03-08 19:42:08 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
1952 2018-03-08 19:42:07 So oil and gas shouldn’t have received subsidies all these decades?? Good to know, but since they have received them it’s now time to help renewables in their R&D.
1953 2018-03-08 19:42:02 Finally got my damn oil changed 
1954 2018-03-08 19:41:57 IF Alberta turns off oil and gas on BC, chances are Alberta beef will be banned in British Columbia as well.

1957 2018-03-08 19:41:43 Second time this week the @jerseymikes in Richardson has screwed up my #8 sandwich. I ask for it Mike's Way plus pickles and it gets returned without oil/vinegar and no pickles or bacon. Now I have a sad sandwich :(
1958 2018-03-08 19:41:41 AC-DC - Cover You In Oil
1959 2018-03-08 19:41:39 A hundred fifty thousand work in steel-producing industries in US. Millions work in steel consuming industries. Tariffs on steel are like tariffs on oil.
1960 2018-03-08 19:41:19 heres the problem with IPO only on Tadawul - even at 1-2% it will dominate the Saudi stock exchange to such an extent that if the price of oil drops it could decimate the exchange. doesn't help with the goal of diversifying the economy away from oil
1961 2018-03-08 19:41:17 They won’t lift a finger except how to put an oil well there
1962 2018-03-08 19:41:08 流通等の関係で一時併売とかではなく、レギュラーで0w-40を2つラインナップするんですか？もしそうならちょっと不思議な感じですねぇ。
現行の0w-40とJは規格仕様は同じ様に思えますし、Jと無印が同じ関係なら差別化が…
Jが現行の後継で無印の方が何か変わるならわからなくはないんですが。
1963 2018-03-08 19:40:57 Geez, @GrowthEnergy on Udall-Welch #RFS bill: "When oil companies try to ghost write legislation for environmental front groups, you end up with some pretty backwards ideas, and that’s exactly what this appears to be"
1964 2018-03-08 19:40:23 Do you think the whole yes movement have answered the questions many Scots believe they hadn’t in ‘14? What currency we would use, oil depleted, all things that still get threw in our face.

1967 2018-03-08 19:40:11 So hold up. God only gave us coal and oil? What about the sun? I'm so confused.
1968 2018-03-08 19:40:10 I think it's leaking oil. 기름이 새는 것 같아요.
1969 2018-03-08 19:40:07 Why do they keep falling over is there oil in the water they spray the pitch with.
1970 2018-03-08 19:39:57 The state of Wyoming is awesome most everyone owns a gun and a very low crime rate and lots of coal miners and oil field workers that’s my kind of place
1971 2018-03-08 19:39:46 Yeah boo coconut oil doesn’t work for everyone and can be tough to handle for melanated folks because it clogs your pores so your skin isn’t actually getting what it jeesa

They want to build millions of machines, so oil will be less needed. Wynne + Trudeau say they want no carbon, but no reply ??
1975 2018-03-08 19:38:49 Thanks for the tip - got clove oil this pm and it is absolutely marvellous. Never tried before but really effective.

1980 2018-03-08 19:38:19 As afraid as I am, I believe in this relationship.
It is strong because it's built on trust.
You may be an Aries, but I'm a Taurus and dammit I will not let go without a fight. We are not oil and water. I was meant to find you and you me. I can feel it.

esfoliar com a borra do café é bom, mas sobre o óleo eu não sei.
1991 2018-03-08 19:35:39 The biggest question for me is why are Madame O's "friends" snake oil salespeople? Oz, Phil, Iyanla...
1992 2018-03-08 19:35:35 Nah nah nah. Don't let them go out there and do that crap. They'll screw up everything. I remember the Santa Barbara spill back in the 60s. It was horrible. Seals, birds, tide pools...everything got slimed. The oil people don't clean up their messes. It's gonna happen again. Damn
1993 2018-03-08 19:35:28 59.95 and go!! Wti...tomorrow its friday ....party oil ...

1995 2018-03-08 19:34:58 Cinnamon essential oil. It burns those assholes. I was trying to remember what I used last year and it just came to me.
1996 2018-03-08 19:34:50 Overheard in Julia’s: “I’m bringing baby oil to the beach... I don’t think I need sunscreen. I really need to get burnt.”  GIRL. If skin cancer doesn’t scare u enough at LEAST try to prevent early-aging?!
1997 2018-03-08 19:34:37 While the base sarcasm is appreciated and understood, I think that the oil would come from elsewhere, can you be more specific as to how this would affect BC market?

2005 2018-03-08 19:33:51 You’re not fooling anyone Tyler. These lying “think tanks” like the heartland Institute publish financial records that SHOW they are funded by oil

All you are doing is proving yourself a liar
2006 2018-03-08 19:33:36 @axios "HOUSTON-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told thousands of mostly oil and natural gas executives at an energy conference here Tuesday that wind turbines kill as many as 750,000 birds a year." @SecretaryZinke BS is an environmental disaster

After all @jacindaarden says & after her meeting Al Gore she still continues to take unreasonable action & declines acknowledgement of harmful exploration. GREENPEACE is SPEAKING UP no mention from Greens?
2011 2018-03-08 19:32:45 "I actually wrestle with him" (mostly in oil)
"I don't just go there to kiss the ring" (I suck on the toes too)
"We have arguments" (But his apologies are soooooo good)
And I usually get a little bauble delivered the next day.
2012 2018-03-08 19:32:33 Really?  I’ve been using so much coconut oil and I guess this is why it’s soooo bad  I have dark dry patches all over my face
2013 2018-03-08 19:32:29 Oh believe me, I feel you. I've seen Yesi and a few my other girlfriends go IN on just (what's considered typical) make up. It's staggering how much that shit costs. Meanwhile, I just have to pay for beardwash, beard oil, hair tonic and a haircut every other month.

2032 2018-03-08 19:30:40 I'm starting to think these companies are just jumping on the bandwagon. Bit like everything has to be about coconut oil now.

2042 2018-03-08 19:29:33 Do NOT put coconut oil on your face. Try a water based cleanser and moisturizer like something by Cetaphil because they’re hydrating but not heavy

2044 2018-03-08 19:29:26 Can't wait to see the EU/China tariffs imposed in response.  Steel and aluminum imports account for only 2% of total US imports, but are heavily replied upon by manufacturers...particularly in the Rust Belt and state economies that rely on automotive/oil industries.

2050 2018-03-08 19:28:55 So much for road car technology. For years European cars have had to consume their own vapours (inc fuel) to meet EEC-IV let alone EEC-VI emmisions standards.

2052 2018-03-08 19:28:43 I agree. It’s ridiculous. The Oklahoma government is gross and they put their money in all the wrong places. What happened to the tax revenue that the lottery was supposed to bring in? Handed right back to the oil business

2071 2018-03-08 19:26:10 My point was that claiming fracking causes crude oil spills is bs. That is a pic of refined oil. 6 oil by the looks of it. Fracking reduces the amount of crude oil and coal used.

2101 2018-03-08 19:21:22 Sort of. I did one on oil leaks but not the job.
2102 2018-03-08 19:21:17 I did sriracha, soy sauce, sesame oil but did avocado base since I like a creamier consistency and I’m an ugly American
2103 2018-03-08 19:21:14 You know you’re an adult when you schedule your car for an oil change AND an inspection for the same day

2106 2018-03-08 19:21:04 Oil and gas companies are doing just that. Lobbyists to stop movements from oil and gas to a renewable source happens all the time everywhere. Just so they can keep capitalizing on that black gold. They would be retarded NOT to lobby even if it is destroying the planet.
2107 2018-03-08 19:20:57 Lmao your oil change should've been around 30 bucks  he definitely finessed you
2108 2018-03-08 19:20:50 Phoenix Tears... Cannabis Oil.  Just a little drop before going to bed gets people to sleep their 8 hours.
2109 2018-03-08 19:20:50 you guys only be tryna get on bout brushing for the sake of waving not hair health in general but as far as moisturizer go that has always been a different conversation lol you olive oil was cool but I never knew it wasn’t really as much as I thought I was
2110 2018-03-08 19:20:40 @bamabroker Oil made a new low, SPX went red for a millisecond and BOOM, 10yr yield goes up 0.04 and then markets go green again. I understand USDJPY and how it is used as a backstop for liquidity. I can't make the correlation with yields and liquidity. Can anyone enlighten me.
2111 2018-03-08 19:20:39 no offense but i finally unboxed my hair products and used my argan oil shampoo and my hair has never been this soft

2118 2018-03-08 19:20:04 Yeah, though I can't blame him for having a hard time talking off-script, the issue is that he tries to make these weird "Edgy" points and it just makes him sound like he's mumblingly defending Hitler? He's basically the perfect foil for oil snakesmen like Comfort.
2119 2018-03-08 19:20:01 Are we even still bombing the shit out of the middle east? I assume we are because we fucking love war and oil but ive not seen a report in weeks. Its all trade tariffs and legislation and i get enough of that at sailor school.

2137 2018-03-08 19:17:31 I have my suspicions that something more sinister is happening. I suspect palm oil has an effect at the neurotransmitter level to enhance the desire to consume more. Our health doesn't concern me as much as the welfare of that little one up there.

2153 2018-03-08 19:15:32 @cydi2k
the very first awareness that I gained in oil exploitation and destruction of international societies was reading the story of Ken Saro-Wiwa.  So this touches me more deeply
2154 2018-03-08 19:15:24 Bi Oil ist halt auch nur besseres Babyöl. Kokosöl gab ich auf das tattoo nach dem ersten Tagen. Verheilte auch. Aber erstgenanntes ist schon „next Level“, die anderen Öle halten eher nur feucht und geschmeidig. Was auch gut sein kann. Aber reicht eventuell nicht.

2157 2018-03-08 19:15:14 In case you didn't see our post earlier today, President Trump's radical offshore drilling plan puts oil industry priorities ahead of people, ignoring widespread local and state opposition. Together, we protected much of the Atlantic and Arctic from dirty new drilling,-

2160 2018-03-08 19:14:58 I think there important, and should be expanded however  more emphasis should be placed by the Oil on researching their draft picks, in past years I think it’s been scouts whim, nepotism, and hear say.

2164 2018-03-08 19:14:42 Yam head-2. If crude oil inflows are cut to less than half, government should shut down, abi? Take some nutrients to increase your brain power, bros. This isn't rocket science.
2165 2018-03-08 19:14:40 Seems like Mr Pump doesn't want oil to break below 60. He does what he can. We really need to take him out back and put him down.
2166 2018-03-08 19:14:37 Norway oil profits not turnover was 18b last year. Assuming underlying figure in Scot is similar that means whisky and fish and everything else are less than 10m. An explanation of oil revenues is needed not some creative accountancy putting Scot exports into UK figures.
2167 2018-03-08 19:14:22 There is NO Oil ....

2171 2018-03-08 19:14:02 @adamvaughan_uk Good evening sir I was reading your recent article on The Guardian "Plastic bans worldwide will dent oil demand growth, says BP"  and i have a small question : what did you mean by "of one form of another" ? thanks in advance
2172 2018-03-08 19:13:38 Actually, Mr. Musk you are exactly right. I commend your efforts.  The government has I feel too much control on this matter.  They need to change regulations, before they risk enormous debts over oil. Oil will be a problem as long as we depend on it.
2173 2018-03-08 19:13:04 The 3 day down movement in Oil was for the last repayment of physical to the strategic reserve.,

2175 2018-03-08 19:12:49 the biggest difference me and a friend could find was in the oil business, but the factor was again that men has less at home to care for and can stay for way longer at a time +++ and the difference was merely 10%. women need to get tougher at negotiation and sacrifice.
2176 2018-03-08 19:12:42 ISIS was created to break up the Middle East without it being obvious that the big oil companies were taking control of the middle east's oil and most importantly - natural gas. Now the battle is perceived as "about freedom" and anti-terror...when its actually an invasion & theft

2178 2018-03-08 19:12:35 That sucks! My skin is oily too, but more combination so I can rock with them. Plus for that I mixed a BB cream with a drop of facial oil and an illuminating moisturizer so it was pretty sheer coverage anyway
2179 2018-03-08 19:12:23 "protect the oceans" meanwhile the federal liberals prefer saudi oil shipped across the Atlantic daily for consumption on the whole east-coast.   this rhetoric has no ground and actions behind it @cathmckenna

Trump doesn’t care about the arctic or California or the beautiful San Juan islands and all the whales and wildlife. No, he’s got to satisfy Putin. After all, he’s a killer

2248 2018-03-08 19:04:33 I need an oil change like yesterday.
2249 2018-03-08 19:04:32 BC tourism contributes as much to BCs revenues as oil and gas. We need to know that #BCTourismMatters
2250 2018-03-08 19:04:31 @billtu very touching to hear your story on SU2C GBBO. My dad had cancer and passed away in 2010. I wish I'd known about CBD oil, if you haven't already have a look into it, - can help symptoms and progression of disease, it truly is worth trying. Stay strong and positive x
2251 2018-03-08 19:04:22 It's exactly the same as mayonnaise but they actually put seasoning and flavor in it so it's notjust a big ol glob of eggy oil, it's like spicy mayonnaise it's hard to explain but you should actually try it sometime, it's a good alternative I used to like Mayo but I converted be-

2258 2018-03-08 19:03:26 There are other potential products from the hemp plant, such as paper, rope, textiles, ethanol, and hemp oil (can be used in Diesel engines). The plant grows at a fast rate as well.
2259 2018-03-08 19:03:26 I agree with you, but a pipeline is the only way to move oil....sure I know accidents happen and pipelines screw up...but the other ways to move oil are by rail or by truck and we all know how much they screw up,so TIL we don’t need oil a pipeline is the safest way to move it...

2268 2018-03-08 19:01:58 Money can buy you wins and CL. Chelsea won it by Russian oil money. Real Madrid won it last season buy buying expensive players Ronaldo, bale, etc. Madrid didn’t win last season with a free squad. PSG need an elite manager, Unai Emery Is a good manager but not world class

2271 2018-03-08 19:01:22 Thatcher and her heirs should have at least been more honest about it like the Russian oil oligarchs - it's the pretence that privatisation and outsourcing is something other than theft and corruption that really riles me

2276 2018-03-08 19:01:09 You can hear the hissing of oil industry snakes and see their forked tongues darting in and out. This is a taste of the satanic, slithering propaganda that the oil industry is capable of. The only things big oil has given to poor countries is war, corruption, and extreme weather.
2277 2018-03-08 19:01:06 I'm all for the pipeline but i doubt it's going to make any difference. Those responsible somehow manage to creep prices up slowly. One only has to look at the price of oil currently in relation to the price of gas.

2294 2018-03-08 18:59:20 Meanwhile oil production is at record high levels.

I guess oil companies found a way to operate without employing Albertans.

Maybe they aren't the great corporate citizens you think they are?

2380 2018-03-08 18:48:39 To him, having electricity and burning fossil fuels are one and the same. Conservatives think of oil not so much as a commodity, but more as an essential element of capitalism. They see oil as the factor that magnifies human potential. Therein lies the problem.
2381 2018-03-08 18:48:39 He fails, from all arguments I have seen him make, to make the distinction between e.g. governments subsidizing solar energy to make them competitive against oil companies with the government selectively helping one solar/oil company against another in the same sector.
2382 2018-03-08 18:48:32 In a traditional American administration, yes. But filling the slot presupposes we have a functioning State Department with a real Secretary of State. In reality we have clueless oil peddler Tillerson posing as SoS while “Foreign Minister” Kushner does international shakedowns.
2383 2018-03-08 18:48:24 This is exactly what my hair looks like after. And then I put on coconut oil and it makes it stay pretty much like that all day

2392 2018-03-08 18:47:35 I'll send you the statement I released before the vote, but Step Up didn't provide any money for the classroom or support personnel, and asked low and middle income folks to pay the lion's share of the revenue while asking very little of oil & gas and those at the top.
2393 2018-03-08 18:47:34 And by "immoral" he means "less profitable for my big oil friends".
2394 2018-03-08 18:47:28 Wasn't any Trumsters listening to him while he was campaigning?  He was a snake oil saleman.
2395 2018-03-08 18:47:27 They have their own oil money! And what about all the shirts sales they had from Pogba, Ibrahimovic and Sanchez??? 
2396 2018-03-08 18:46:52 A friend  of mine saw #TheSaudiPrince chauffeur driven while the #Police ushered him. Why do we have cuts to vital #PoliceServices but there's money wasted for this #Royal? Arms & oil go hand in hand.

2418 2018-03-08 18:45:00 If you dine out....you unfortunately eat soy. Vegetable oil is derived from soy and every restaurant pretty much uses it

2425 2018-03-08 18:44:35 The Saudi regime might be detestable but they own half of London and are a primary oil supplier to the West so I see why we have to entertain them. Iran, on the other hand DOESN’T and ISN’T so why would any politician indulge that vile regime, unless of course he is sympathetic?
2426 2018-03-08 18:44:30 Ugh shouts to these brows transforming , & Jamaican castor oil for powering them up

2429 2018-03-08 18:44:01 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2444 2018-03-08 18:42:33 Simplification but: Saudi Arabia started out as a client state of the British Empire. Then they made a deal with Roosevelt to keep the oil flowing in return for no interference. Now the UK is a client state of Saudi Arabia, and it is a bulwark against Iran for the US.
2445 2018-03-08 18:42:22 lemme bless u with this lil mix I do. I get a blender cup &pour my coffe in it, then fill the rest with vanilla almond milk (I use the sweetened 1 for more flav) then a few pinches of cinnamon and about 1/2 tbsp of coconut oil and I blend it.
2446 2018-03-08 18:42:18 A7: Usually face wash does the trick unless I'm wearing any waterproof makeup. That usually requires a cleansing oil.  #WetNWildxWalgreens

2452 2018-03-08 18:41:45 Maybe we should donate some of our oil money to the Samaritans to help them out.
2453 2018-03-08 18:41:40 But it also points towards #oil not rising in 2018.

2455 2018-03-08 18:41:01 Yet, Trump’s involvement with Russian Mafia/oligarchs demands investigation, as does any foreign influence on any public official or his associates, whether FDR/Stalin, Bushes/Saudis/Big Oil, or Clintons/Russia/China, all US officials/Israel, etc. Foreign meddling is rampant.
2456 2018-03-08 18:40:54 I’ll try, it’s sounds like my type of party lol
2457 2018-03-08 18:40:53 If there is cold in your area and that substance is only on the cap, that may be normal. If the issue is in the gasket, then all oil in the motor will look like this.

2459 2018-03-08 18:40:47 a really good way to wake yourself up is to put 5 drops of peppermint essential oil on your wrists, accidentally pour out half the bottle, and embrace the burn for the next hour
2460 2018-03-08 18:40:40 Investment and jewelry is what I would call social constructs. In other words, a sentiment change could diminish its value severely. Compare to something like oil or gas, which is also scarce but has its value derived by utility first. But you're right, it's a subjective view.
2461 2018-03-08 18:40:32 The same bunch of incredible ppl who never allowed school to pass through them keeps ranting nonsense about this government.  Bcos  they lack the human common sense that a country whose only source of income depend on oil can't do any magic to turn the country around ova nyt.
2462 2018-03-08 18:40:31 It causes destruction of the rain forest in exactly the same way that consuming palm sugars do. Forest is cleared to plant oil palm. Forest is cleared for cattle ranches. The issues are the same. Without demand for either, neither would happen.

2477 2018-03-08 18:39:10 VERY simple! The eggplant only took a few minutes per side and the frozen veggies were lightly sauteéd in coconut oil so also only took a few minutes! 
2478 2018-03-08 18:39:06 No need to give any money from centre. Give every drop of oil to our state. The central government is simply looting us. Our diamond mines gave kohinoor to the world. Our wealth is looted by British and then by center.

2483 2018-03-08 18:38:50 I tried something a few years ago and it was really really helpful! I think it's called "primrose oil" in English (?) I'm not very sure though >< They are some natural pills. You just have to take one every day and when your period comes... there's no pain at all :)
2484 2018-03-08 18:38:47 I swear, if I don’t get an oil change today bc they’re too busy I’m gonna be livid lmaoooo
2485 2018-03-08 18:38:43 Excuse me Smucker's but vegetable oil is already expensive enough and I like the way homemade cookies taste over store bought but I also prefer not to spend way more money just to make them from scratch

2502 2018-03-08 18:36:57 I’d be perfectly happy with a pepperoni pizza that just had pepperoni oil and no actual slices.
2503 2018-03-08 18:36:55 The deregulation in financial and other areas, the tariffs, the push for industries that the US is evolving away from (oil, coal), housing prices rising, etc. It's all sounding a lot like the environment that created the recession in 2008.
2504 2018-03-08 18:36:54 We are, yes. Seeing the national parks before they get turned into oil fields
2505 2018-03-08 18:36:47 Have you looked into Simpson Oil? I've heard great things about it.
2506 2018-03-08 18:36:26 The moment Kenya discovered oil is when kleptocracy consolidated. 
Kenyatta, the Americans and other looters will never leave it to the natives to rule themselves.

A possible way out is to form a different cartel. Mortgage the same oil at a worse price to the Russians.
2507 2018-03-08 18:36:15 One more thing about natural resources. We have great oil reserves in krishna godavari basin . Surprising thing that center is not giving any royalty for our state but looting our oil. Where as gujarat is getting royalty for oil reserves.

2512 2018-03-08 18:35:34 Canada gets a reprieve but not on landlock discount on its oil exports (30%). Rockefeller and Ford Foundation along with Tom Steyer have weaponized abos and helped elect Trudeau to cockblock any new pipelines shipping goo to the BC coast.
2513 2018-03-08 18:35:32 I'm not blaming anyone.  We should stand or fall on our own so should EU or the individual European countries.  Much of the pro EU British media has been highlighting how EU fisherman decimated our resources and put fishermen out of jobs. 11 billion barrels of oil left too :-)

2523 2018-03-08 18:34:05 Why is it that when I’m on the way to get an oil change it’s the slowest drive ever
2524 2018-03-08 18:33:58 Ok so Oklahoma is a big player in oil and gas and yet their teachers are the lowest paid in the country. They are a republican state and a perfect example of corporate welfare and irresponsible government. Time for voters to wake up he hell up! 
 
2525 2018-03-08 18:33:55 When you say "whale oil beef hooked" fast it'll sound like "well I'll be fucked" in an Irish accent.
2526 2018-03-08 18:33:52 Any Western leader caught on film doing that would be boiled in oil. Like yesterday.
2527 2018-03-08 18:33:43 Those oil spills of our coasts will suit you well then.  MAGA, better with pollution.  Idiot.  #blocked
2528 2018-03-08 18:33:39 That will do it But be careful with your calcium and high blood pressure from all of salt and oil
2529 2018-03-08 18:33:28 WEIRD FANTASY. A gravekeeper hunts his missing corpse in a clockwork city without streets. Whispers of oil & honey, oneiric architecture & a drowned oracle. CLAY rises to change everything, and the abandoned factory awaits at the city's beating heart. #pitmad #A #F
2530 2018-03-08 18:33:26 Very Islamic of you, brother. Masalam
2531 2018-03-08 18:33:12 You can say that all you want but its not true. Dems didnt want the pipeline, trump allows it and it spills.. thats on republicans. Just because obama was pres when the gulf oil spill occurred doesnt mean hes to blame. Trump appointed a fmr oil exec to secretary of state!! Cmon!
2532 2018-03-08 18:33:06 That would leave a big mess, if there were'd to be any oil rigging near the shores of New England. If any, I'd be 10 miles off shores.

2536 2018-03-08 18:32:38 I know precisely what he’s doing. He has had his scheduled meetings with oil and gas industry leaders. Despite renewables being the fastest growing energy sector, those leaders have told him to target evangelicals, you know, the people who believe only in myths.
2537 2018-03-08 18:32:35 Does he high five the closest oil executive every time he makes one of these stupid comments??#oldguyenergy #getoffthepipe
2538 2018-03-08 18:32:25 I just watched the video and the conclusion is.. I'm going to the store to buy baby oil.  Thank you for the amazing videos. 
2539 2018-03-08 18:32:20 Someone please tell them they look ridiculous.
2540 2018-03-08 18:32:18 What's the essence of going public when you're highly endowed?... If not the most endowed oil company in the world

2543 2018-03-08 18:32:06 It's okay our Premier will just use taxpayers money to reclaim the abandoned gas Wells
So that the big oil companies can keep their billions of dollars

2545 2018-03-08 18:31:46 So then why do you support a president who praises dictators and autocrats (Putin, Erdogan, Jinping, etc)?? One who props up outdated industries like coal and oil drilling and who welcomes trade wars? That is not capitalism, that is fascism. #LessonOfTheDay
2546 2018-03-08 18:31:35 Nah that’s fish oil moet
2547 2018-03-08 18:31:22 I now that last tweet was out of order. But oil paintings take it out of you.
2548 2018-03-08 18:31:20 I just watched my wife cook bacon in olive oil and I’m scared and confused.
2549 2018-03-08 18:31:17 That money never comes from big oil or the big corporations you claim go after, costs are passed 2 consumers- it's your scheme to make people (who are ignorant) support it!  You make me sick.

2556 2018-03-08 18:30:22 @SecretaryPerry I think your pro- refugee, pro-drowned cities, pro-death and disease, anti-science, anti-renewable agenda is pretty fucking immoral and downright obscene.

2560 2018-03-08 18:30:05 So here I am. I had risen to the heights of power within the world of direct sales essential oil products and fallen hard when I had to stand up for what I believe in. Now who wants order some DoTerra?!?
2561 2018-03-08 18:29:52 Jerry Brown and family own all the oil in CA so it’s a moot point.
2562 2018-03-08 18:29:15 Obummer was in charge when we had the big oil blowout in the Gulf.
2563 2018-03-08 18:29:03 Sadly, you might be right. Oil is the only commodity keeping this marriage from breaking.

2565 2018-03-08 18:28:55 OIL rolling over, again, stays below 20MA 15M chart. WATCH confirm lower.
NATGAS also holding below 20MA 15M chart, should "dip" one more time to set up properly to go bullish. 
USD continues higher, GOLD breaks sync and holds neutral.
2566 2018-03-08 18:28:36 Agree. People are ridiculous. 

It’s really to be considered for intractable seizure. There is a cannabinoid oil available so smoking is not necessary. Unfortunately there is such a separation b/t this & conventional medicine. Parents are largely on their own.
2567 2018-03-08 18:28:36 ya know what grinds my gears? Not keeping my oil topped up.
2568 2018-03-08 18:28:32 She always did the right thing-until she didn’t. It’s the 1920's & Violet Conrad, former Rose Queen/oil heiress has it all-until she's thrust into a world of lust, drugs & rum runners. How many secrets can she keep before someone dies? #PitMad #A #WF

2580 2018-03-08 18:26:45 Oil nhi thuk laga k
2581 2018-03-08 18:26:39 Actually, income tax revenues are higher today than they were before that tax cut. And spending went up a lot in those years--oil and gas prices were high, and there was temporary federal bailout cash. But you said 8 years of cuts; I just wondered if that was true.
2582 2018-03-08 18:26:38 And Jacob Wohl has moved down to the third in the ass kissing league, behind Charlie 'Cheeto lips' Kirk and Joey 'I'll be your Twink' Mann. Donald Trump's demanding that these 3 toadying sycophants, battle it out naked in a paddling pool of baby oil. Let the games begin!

2585 2018-03-08 18:25:47 Did he drink the old oil or something?
2586 2018-03-08 18:25:40 But only too, if it's doused in good olive oil. Nom!
2587 2018-03-08 18:25:25 Nope. But Oil gonna Oil

2590 2018-03-08 18:25:06 Yep, give a woman-become-object $130,000 of what could be used for something useful. Or hand an Einstein visa to another object-of-a-woman to come to America support fascism from a plutocrat.
2591 2018-03-08 18:25:05 That oil 
2592 2018-03-08 18:24:58 Its a shame to waste such a tendril-rich infrastructure. Got to believe, just like the NRA, there are plenty of oil bucks “greasing” political coffers.
2593 2018-03-08 18:24:58 You can sell April silver 1700 call and 1600 put at combined 15 cents or better with 15 days left 'til expiration. Should stay in a trading range, all things being equal.  Check out crude oil tankers in transit to U.S.  This looks like it could come under pressure.  Nothing else.
2594 2018-03-08 18:24:43 Right. So for you North which has 25% of Syrian population keeps all the oil while the 75% others get nothing because US decided they don’t like the president they chose. With US airforce to enforce the rip off. You’re right, sounds fantastic!
2595 2018-03-08 18:24:21 Coconut oil will solve all your problems
2596 2018-03-08 18:24:15 If you work at an auto parts store and cannot tell the difference between used coolant and used transmission oil (not gear oil), you should reevaluate your job until you educate yourself.

2603 2018-03-08 18:23:04 A4 coconut oil to remove makeup, blotting lipstick tricks& using lipstick as blush! #WetNWildxWalgreens
2604 2018-03-08 18:22:59 it depends on how thick you lay down the paint and if you mixed water in there too how long it’ll take to separate, but overall mixing oil and water based media is never a good idea
2605 2018-03-08 18:22:52 He blames video guns and not real guns. Brilliant.
2606 2018-03-08 18:22:47 U.S. oil production reached a record high in November as the shale boom puts the nation among the world's biggest suppliers and upends global markets.
2607 2018-03-08 18:22:37 It won't be a bad idea if you used engine oil.
2608 2018-03-08 18:22:24 Apparently The Yemen government wanted help but we both know that’s a fib at best, this meeting was about increasing arms sales for more oil, that’s how we’re going to pay off Brexit it’s a stain on all of us that our government is doing this 
2609 2018-03-08 18:22:17 #GirlTalkZA #GirlsTalkZa If you have on matte lipstick or foundation and you find it difficult to wipe off , coconut oil is a good makeup remover

2616 2018-03-08 18:21:14 Finally, it was time to distill the last oil. We had gathered all the proper components; damask rose from the funeral of a Virgo born with Sagittarius in Midheaven, gentian flower anointed in the tears of the mother of a dead Capricorn born with Neptune in Aries
2617 2018-03-08 18:21:10 Reminds me of the time I went to the Petroleum museum (don’t ask) and the guide was SO proud of how environmentally sound they were for using solar power to pump the crude oil through their environmentally destructive pipeline
2618 2018-03-08 18:20:59 I don't know - I'm asking. Clearly, rising U.S. crude - mostly shale - 2010-2015 (plus soft demand) caused the oil price crash. Seems shale is keeping lid on prices now. How is that if you're saying the demand for shale oil isn't there? I'm just curious what you think will happen
2619 2018-03-08 18:20:58 Coconut oil as a facial moisturizer is probably one of the biggest lies that circulated beauty tips twitter

2630 2018-03-08 18:19:09 Guyana already have its option, the world court. There is nothing to negotiate after 28 years negotiations. Maybe venezuela would like to drag it out another 50years. Oil concessions are within internationally recognise borders. Venezuela could send their navy....

2638 2018-03-08 18:17:39 I covered them in olive oil, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and pepper and baked them then fried them and tossed them in a siracha lime sauce. They had a kick, but not overwhelming.
2639 2018-03-08 18:17:38 Commandeering bible quotes is tacky and uncouth. Stop it. You pass legislation for money, not for taxpayers. What kind of job do you think you’ll try after this November? Snake oil salesman?

2648 2018-03-08 18:15:41 My computer fan suddenly started running really loud. I hope it's something a simple cleaning and some oil can fix. Otherwise I think it may need to be replaced.
2649 2018-03-08 18:15:41 M1 velocity of USD (GDP/M1 quantity) is 1/2 of what it was in 2008. The last time it was this low was 1973. It's keeping inflation low. It will probably start rising at the same time oil prices rise, so inflation could be on the way.

2707 2018-03-08 18:09:12 The research is there to support it. CBD is legal in every state. It's basically the oil left after the good stuff is extracted. And it does work. My mother, who's 87, uses the salve for her polymyalgia. I think soon, the country will legalize it.

2724 2018-03-08 18:06:33 But again, Mexico is going to be an oil producer for vastly longer than the length of any possible futures contract. So it's not at all clear what such hedging accomplishes for them.

2791 2018-03-08 17:58:35 I don’t understand the big deal about this. I can get what is essentially heroine prescribed to me by a doctor for aches and pains but they’re fighting over who gets to buy non-THC containing CBD oil? This whole thing is just so dumb.
2792 2018-03-08 17:58:26 Coconut oil!!!!!
2793 2018-03-08 17:58:14 Oh no that’s not good! The only makeup remover I use is the Neutrogena oil free eye makeup remover. It has the layer of liquid and oil and you shake it together. It does leave an oily residue but I always wash my face anyway. Time for ABH to release a makeup remover.

2807 2018-03-08 17:56:57 There is a difference in refined coal and raw coal, much like crude oil and unleaded gas.  Problem is refined coal will be cheaper per BTU than most everything else so moneyed interests need to stop it.  A lot of rice bowls to protect.

2826 2018-03-08 17:54:38 در انگلیسی الان snake oil عملا برای اشاره به جنس تقلبی و بی اثر استفاده میشه. در فارسی هم شاید چند سال زمان و کلی پول و انرژی از دست رفته بطلبه تا همچین مفهومی پیدا کنه.

2931 2018-03-08 17:40:40 NO is not independent. Also, they don't need their inner market to sell as much oil as they want, and oil will be an essential product even when it is not used as fuel anymore. It has way too many uses.

2943 2018-03-08 17:39:04 The moisturizer I have has tea tree oil in it, and my face doesn’t react good to that at all  useless info I know, but my face feels sunburnt so I though I’d share 
2944 2018-03-08 17:39:01 Interesting read. Did not know that about all the water consumption etc. Easy swaps (not sold on Millet, but might try it) don’t start me on palm oil as I won’t stop!!!!
2945 2018-03-08 17:39:00 Just had a conversation about the 70's Castrol oil ad where it ran down the can & into the spanner 'liquid engineering' because that's how we roll in this house!
2946 2018-03-08 17:38:45 I put my groceries away, made 'dinner' and stuffed my face with it + kept left overs for on the train. I'm changing the oil of my frying pan now, washing dishes and then getting my behind on a train to my parents :)
2947 2018-03-08 17:38:39 Oil heat creates so much damn dust
2948 2018-03-08 17:38:34 It is ponderous but can the oil tanker be turned to calmer seas as technology and innovation whip up the waves ?
2949 2018-03-08 17:38:26 Oil control ba talaga to? HAHAHA

2952 2018-03-08 17:37:28 To do it properly use all oil instead of water. If you're hurrying you cut start a flash fire right in the face. I've seen it happen, not pretty
2953 2018-03-08 17:37:27 OPEC appear to fixing the price of oil!
2954 2018-03-08 17:37:22 peppermint oil on temples & weed
2955 2018-03-08 17:37:10 I feel like some folks may be confusing BRIK barrels, which the Alberta government is responsible for through APMC, with the commercial contracts that make up the overwhelming majority of oil and gas that is shipped from Alberta.
2956 2018-03-08 17:37:00 I guess  2014-15 and 2015-16 are fresher in my memory.

2963 2018-03-08 17:36:20 Relative to some aka Erie schools maybe Sharon. Isnt exactly close to Oil City, Franklin, Warren. And you know what else is nice? Florida for baseball but no one taking PA Championships there. As long as PA taxpayers are funding it should be in PA. - Chris

2966 2018-03-08 17:35:55 Apparently Holland and Barrett now do the oil but when I looked for myself it’s nowhere near the percentage it needs to be to make a difference. More needs to be done. We are so behind.
2967 2018-03-08 17:35:48 تغيير ايه بس صل ع النبي
2968 2018-03-08 17:35:34 Since NO has no electric car factories, NO is...er, what exactly?

The country has taken a stand - despite it's riches coming from an abundance of oil and global investments - NO owns approx 1.3% of all stocks - it knows the future is not oil.
Doing the opposite would be so easy.
2969 2018-03-08 17:35:19 I found this new body oil and I’m really feeling it. A bitch smell like the rainforests of the amazon and my skin feels like liquid. Blessings.
2970 2018-03-08 17:35:09 According to Reuters, with higher oil prices in January, more global oil and gas companies expect to increase capital spending

2976 2018-03-08 17:34:29 It was SO GOOD. The Leftovers was like an oil painting that got more textured the more layers were painted. I thought season 3 and the ending were p much perfect
2977 2018-03-08 17:34:20 Oil is money
We love oil, you buy petrol
Money buys players

2983 2018-03-08 17:32:51 Spent 8 minutes tossing it, sprinkling seasoning on it, and adding oil so the seasoning sticks 
It shows in the taste

2990 2018-03-08 17:31:24 who is Big Ag? And what makes you think that agricultural interests aren't already making advances in fueling infrastructure? But who holds the majority of the fuel inventory? And there is no assumption on Oil's monopoly/oligopoly.
2991 2018-03-08 17:31:13 Redknapp sides were always for the short term. Some argued and still do that we underachieved with the players we had back then. Bit cruel to suggest that as all we can do is overachieve thanks to the oil money we're up against.
2992 2018-03-08 17:31:06 Full tank of gas now oil change 
2993 2018-03-08 17:31:04 There's still sand from the last beach I went to in the small vial of lavender oil I always keep in my pocket. I've also eaten arbys twice this week so I guess make of this what you will

Russian steel used in Keystone XL Pipeline, Russian Oil Deal with Exxon (Rex Tillerson) and Russian Trolls and hackers running elections !!
2995 2018-03-08 17:31:01 Look at it this way, if I owns a oil drilling company I will be locking in my profits at $65-$62. No excuse or what if?!

3000 2018-03-08 17:30:30 Yes, but this reminded me of the recent trips he's been taking and the waste of money it is. I think he should be focusing on domestic issues first (regardless) like helping out local export industries (steel, aluminum, oil, asbestos, etc)

3006 2018-03-08 17:30:01 Fascinated to see the Cdn govt going medieval on ocean plastic pollution when you can’t make all that cheap plastic without a world market awash in oil and natural gas
3007 2018-03-08 17:30:00 Teacey! Well done you for outing them. I find it despicable that it's disguised in this way. If I can make it at home then there is absolutely no reason to use palm oil in peanut butter.
3008 2018-03-08 17:29:44 Larry Hagman apparently once had a 90 minute convo on a plane with an oil investor, as JR
3009 2018-03-08 17:29:28 How much oil drilling and mining will be allowed here?

3020 2018-03-08 17:27:47 @POTUS PLEASE legalize NonTHC CBD oil
3021 2018-03-08 17:27:46 But that's not true male dominated jobs are more profitable because they are harder and more dangerous how many women are miners/oil industry/construction sites etc zero to none
3022 2018-03-08 17:27:44 There might be some oil underneath. Let's open it up for some drilling.
3023 2018-03-08 17:27:39 Ugh, oil and gas has so many subsidies, stop trying to say that renewables are so advantaged by subsidies.

分かりました...!!私も少しはうまく返せるように頑張りたいと思います
3027 2018-03-08 17:27:04 interesting. I have no strong view on oil over the medium term. However, with liquidity being an issue & record longs #oil looks very vulnerable in the ST even after the initial correction
3028 2018-03-08 17:27:04 I'll be making candles and essential oil infused bath bombs for sale
3029 2018-03-08 17:26:57 Oh I don’t know if I could do cinnamon  I usually take the oil with a big glass of water!
3030 2018-03-08 17:26:46 Nothing about Stormy Daniels & all the women accusing him of sexual assault or harassment? Racism? Bullying? But oil drilling?
3031 2018-03-08 17:26:22 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3032 2018-03-08 17:26:16 I do need an oil change.
3033 2018-03-08 17:26:14 You absolutely can cut carbon without pricing .  Consumers need choices in the market when all we have is carbon base choices. Plus oil is big money for government there is no way your in a hurry to get rid of it. Carbon is a tax on everything you did it
3034 2018-03-08 17:25:59 You said the Chevy was a good starter vehicle. I addressed that. All that oil your Mopar is leakin must be gettin in your water supply.

US could trade internally happily - market huge. Soon to be biggest oil/energy producer. What's Australia's problem? Where's the innovation?

3040 2018-03-08 17:25:19 Hi @CertasBusiness we ordered heating oil last week and were assured we would have our delivery by Wednesday. We still haven't had it and noone has been answering the phone. We are running on fumes now!
3041 2018-03-08 17:24:52 He did mention a slide in bitcoin could lead the stocks down . He was bullish on oil at the time . And if inflation continues to be the theme ,  I wonder if he’s still got the same view on crude
3042 2018-03-08 17:24:50 Glad I took a 3rd day off this week, this oil change is taking foreverrrr
3043 2018-03-08 17:24:48 I’ve been using the Aloe Vera gel from the plant mix w/ vitamin E oil, lavender, peppermint, and Tea tree oil every night. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments and I noticed a glow. Might try the Aztec clay mask again since I have it.
3044 2018-03-08 17:24:39 For far too long, California has provided this country with organic produce, good wine, olive oil, some great ( some not so great) movies, more than it’s fair share of federal tax monies , and.....I could go on, but should I ? I live in Indiana, so, like Pence, what do I know?
3045 2018-03-08 17:24:38 my car drives so much better after an oil change
3046 2018-03-08 17:24:29 I don't mind Cindy garb in FFXV, but as a former mechanic, trying to get rid of oil and gasoline smell from your hands is fucking hard and your skin stains and cracks. Now imagine that all over your body.

3050 2018-03-08 17:24:06 Measure five ounces of olive oil and set aside.
3051 2018-03-08 17:23:54 My first snarky reply in this thread was to the motherfucking Oil Council tweeting "Shell 1 Musk 0" which sure as hell sounds like it.
3052 2018-03-08 17:23:53 Folks: does anyone know a reputable source for CBD oil that I can use to help my sick kitter? Maybe you know a site I can buy from@rileecoyote?

3058 2018-03-08 17:23:14 Bunch of NONSENSE other that what was already public knowledge about Page giving a lecture in Russia. (Btw - same University that Obama gave lecture) 
Ridiculous nonsense like Putin was personally gonna give Carter Page 19% of the Nat'l Oil Company Gazprom worth like $30 Billion
3059 2018-03-08 17:23:04 Police shooting more people (many Black) was Obama’s FAULT because? Native Americans and others not wanting a possible deadly oil spill on their land (the original Caucasian city refused it) is Obama’s fault because? Trump’s involvement in Russia is HIS doing as is the AFFAIR.
3060 2018-03-08 17:22:57 I'm a watchtower in the morning

3069 2018-03-08 17:21:44 Funny..I’m currently waiting on an oil change. 
3070 2018-03-08 17:21:42 @mattyglesias Just read you article on trade. I disagree with you on the oil issue. If we were to stop importing oil and oil sold for say $65/bbl there would be more jobs created here in the O&G industry as were are now at the point where we are able to be exporters of O&G. cost
3071 2018-03-08 17:21:36 Lier lier pants on fire! There is no justification for her lying! Lying never bothered her Dad! It's a family affair! When can we get this new lying GOP out! Vote GOP OUT no line to long! Rain nor snow can stop our BLUE WAVE!  to save America from the GREEDY oil industry!
3072 2018-03-08 17:21:32 True, they do not know the implications of what they are doing, I saw another applying Vaseline,coconut oil and something else, the baby's scalp can't breath

3074 2018-03-08 17:20:57 Being an Arsenal and Lyon fan is kinda funny because they both peaked in early 2000s and now oil money killed both of them
3075 2018-03-08 17:20:54 Rick Simpson made his directly from the plant. Didnt seperate THC from CBD. So are these companies making 'snake oil' and giving people false hope. @Shackviral
3076 2018-03-08 17:20:51 I think I'm moving on from drawing in an #anime or #manga art style since I can't draw basic human anatomy correctly.

So instead I'm just going to focus on doing more oil and acrylic #paintings, since I've been enjoying that lately

3086 2018-03-08 17:19:51 That was before 'We r going 2 dismantle Western democracies thru cyber warfare, help Syrian dictators slaughter their own, & attack neighboring countries 4 oil' Putin came into the picture.
3087 2018-03-08 17:19:47 Oh my goodness the guy with vegetable oil.
3088 2018-03-08 17:19:46 @RashmiAhuja31 Hi. Are there any health benefits in using canola oil? How diff. is it from other cooking oils.? I see a lot of articles on internet with -ve views on canola oil whereas the companies marketing it claim of huge health benefits. Pls help make the right choice. Thx.
3089 2018-03-08 17:19:30 but be careful with tea tree oil if you have animals!!! it’s extremely toxic
3090 2018-03-08 17:19:13 My friend use tea tree oil 
3091 2018-03-08 17:19:11 Merci! 
3092 2018-03-08 17:19:01 The (slightly annoying) YouTuber Simply Nailogical has a video on how to grow nice strong nails that I recommend. You gotta oil those lil dry puppies.
3093 2018-03-08 17:18:59 oh!イル
3094 2018-03-08 17:18:59 That's the reason why its suppressed. Imagine if everyone ran their cars on water? The gas and oil companys wpuld go out of business lol
3095 2018-03-08 17:18:55 @LondonLogCo Thank you so much for being my knight in shiny armour! I owe you! The lovely local oil people I mentioned are @Eliaoliveoil
3096 2018-03-08 17:18:54 What's the link?? I just said that the reason he's here so we can get oil
3097 2018-03-08 17:18:35 That moment when you realize thr fish oil your mom bought for you isn't burpless. Grooossssss. *weeps* *belches*
3098 2018-03-08 17:18:23 @chigrl all thanks go to you for sharing your views so openly and helping me know more abt oil .

3103 2018-03-08 17:17:53 There was an essential oil rep at the career fair & of course I made a mess. I’m going to be smelling this peppermint mix all day now.
3104 2018-03-08 17:17:42 What oil do you use!? I totally have to keep mine up most days because the frizz curl is outta control.
3105 2018-03-08 17:17:39 Tea tree oil helps
3106 2018-03-08 17:17:27 I hope they succeed. Most of Saudi's current electricity generation is from burning oil, which is horrible for the climate. It sucks that it apparently takes rampant corruption to get what should be a transparently good policy to possibly come to fruition.
3107 2018-03-08 17:17:26 Almond oil, rose water, cumcumber
3108 2018-03-08 17:17:25 clove oil is pretty helpful. thanks again for the suggestion. still in intense pain. absent from work... again.
3109 2018-03-08 17:17:25 Also happy to help. I'll change your oil, top up the water and back it into that tight space as well if you like. I'd hate for you to get your hands dirty or break a nail.
3110 2018-03-08 17:17:21 where does he think oil comes from ....he is a moron looks like both of them swallowed the global warming koolaid.....im surprised they didnt roll out govt funded david suzuki to join the dumbfest

3114 2018-03-08 17:16:57 I successfully put CBD oil in my juul! first time trying cbd let’s see how it helps!
3115 2018-03-08 17:16:50 I disagree.  Ever seen the smarmy self righteous Ron Reagan ads for Atheism?  Fine line between that and an evangelical.  Plenty of snake oil to go around.
3116 2018-03-08 17:16:47 pro tip: Don't use your Pet Hair Eraser vacuum on spilled protein powder. Because the powder is all fluffy, and the pet hair has wee bits of dander and oil, and they mix to make A PET HAIR STICKY POWDER GLUE. And they don't make A PET HAIR STICKY POWDER GLUE vacuum.
3117 2018-03-08 17:16:41 Tea tree oil it dries it out
3118 2018-03-08 17:16:41 It's a great day to play fetch. Yes I'm trying to make fetch happen! Come down to @ScentedStudio  and fetch an awesome scent! From body oil to a super moisturizing body whip. Oooh a ball.... #perfumes #Customs4U #bodyoil #beardoil #soap #lipscrub #FABULOUS
3119 2018-03-08 17:16:40 Where oil and spices go?
3120 2018-03-08 17:16:36 But look to pinterest or google for good oil combinations because even though that worked for me, other oils or even oil combinations may be better for you.
3121 2018-03-08 17:16:27 Send that numbskull back to Texas. Give him an oil well to play with.

3125 2018-03-08 17:16:23 Which countries benefit the most from high oil & diminishing dollar?

Not us...
3126 2018-03-08 17:16:19 I guess u rather have train loads of oil going thru your province and trucks filled with oil. If that make sense to u so be it. Or maybe no oil to BC. Let's see how that works.

3129 2018-03-08 17:16:00 Snake oil 
3130 2018-03-08 17:16:00 Highly related to oil over the past 3 and half years, although not exclusively.
3131 2018-03-08 17:15:57 @KELLYOUBREJR try cbd oil Kelly, a few drops under the tongue twice a day.
3132 2018-03-08 17:15:42 Oil down 1.5% and Crude testing $60
3133 2018-03-08 17:15:29 Numerous people have made cars that run off water, but do you really think the car/oil  companies will allow this... no way
3134 2018-03-08 17:15:28 Oil down 1.5% and Crude testing $60
3135 2018-03-08 17:15:22 This essential oil craze is just more useless woo.  You wouldn't believe how many of my friends have suddenly taken up selling that crap!

3140 2018-03-08 17:14:57 when will i start to schedule oil changes before i’m over due instead of after
3141 2018-03-08 17:14:23 I tried to put peppermint oil on my forehead to lessen the headache. Now I have a headache and cold temples.

Moral of the story:
Just get high. It works way better.
3142 2018-03-08 17:14:21 Ya beard need some coconut oil, ya lips need some chapstick, and sometimes ya look like ya bathed in grease.
3143 2018-03-08 17:14:21 Need to go get my oil changed 
3144 2018-03-08 17:14:13 I heard it was really popular with oil rich Saudi families and leads to scores dying in horrible conditions
3145 2018-03-08 17:14:07 The oil cleanser, serum and toner. I’ve always been afraid of oil cleansers, but i thought why not try yours. I’m using it once a week to see how my skin reacts. But the toner? Amazing. Serum? Divine. Now, i want the night cream and the other cleanser. Can’t wait for restock.
3146 2018-03-08 17:14:01 Water and oil will never mix. Even if you mix oil and water together they will still separate.
3147 2018-03-08 17:13:46 Oil pastels are basically just grown up crayons and I’m here for it
3148 2018-03-08 17:13:42 Not so, oil still makes lots of money
3149 2018-03-08 17:13:33 And that's a PPV I'd pay for!
3150 2018-03-08 17:13:25 There is no moral division between Blood Diamonds, Unethical oil or Slave steel. 

All produced to gain financial advantages, at the cost of death and misery.
3151 2018-03-08 17:13:18 Who wants to go to California & see the oil rigs? Thats what Trump had planned
3152 2018-03-08 17:13:04 benzoyl peroxide works wonders and tea tree oil works great to dry them out
3153 2018-03-08 17:12:57 Pretty bearish curve move in #oil, further underscoring that a deeper downside is imminent
3154 2018-03-08 17:12:35 As Long As U Have A Pussy, U Should Never Be Begging For Ride Food Money Etc. U Shouldn't Be Struggling Yo Bills Shouldn't Be Behind Car Should Be Gased Tuned Up Oil Changed Etc. I Ain't Saying Sell Yo Pussy. I'm Just Saying It's Too Much Free Pussy Being Giving To Niggas
3155 2018-03-08 17:12:12 Do they actually produce oil?  Think I did mean to put a 'most' in there ;-)

3158 2018-03-08 17:11:41 Its a magical thing cream coffe when the oil mixes with anti freeze or coolant etc etc
3159 2018-03-08 17:11:19 @GenevieveNnaji1 does your hair smell like hot oil
3160 2018-03-08 17:11:01 Also lots of Oil ,Scotland rich country with a thief as a neighbour and also con artists who convince a large number of Scots they are too poor
3161 2018-03-08 17:11:00 They are posted outside this black females door, threatening, cursing, saying they hate blacks! 

She should of boiled some oil, water, and an onion and dumped it all of them!

3164 2018-03-08 17:10:39 What always amazes me is what little that neighbourhood has offered to the modern world. With their wealth through oil reserves they could have educated their people to be the best & brightest. Yet they’ve focused so much of their energy on violence & wars.
3165 2018-03-08 17:10:39 That being said @EPAScottPruitt has made the @EPA a total sham and nothing more than a corporate shill to protect his oil and gas buddies. I sure hope that Children’s Climate lawsuit keeps going.
3166 2018-03-08 17:10:35 Yes! Know your worth. And your car’s worth!  And rotate your tires. And get your oil changed. And... come to think of it this may just be a Jiffy Lube commercial.
3167 2018-03-08 17:10:33 Art materials and equipment: brushes = pinceles, brochas; palette = paleta; easel = caballete; palette knife = espátula; varnish = varniz; oils = óleos; acrylics = acrílicos; watercolors = acuarelas; pastels = pasteles; oil pastels = pasteles de aceite; ink = tinta.
3168 2018-03-08 17:10:33 This is your daily reminder that GLOBAL WARMING EXISTS  and is cooking our planet. WE HAVE NO OTHER HOME!!! Make laws to protect the environment now before we need to take horribly drastic measures. There will be war over fresh water, food, oil, and safe living environments.
3169 2018-03-08 17:10:25 That’s how i feel with these houses and then they keep sending me shit with oil no no no

3174 2018-03-08 17:09:57 Wow, corrupted and pathetic! Look, I'm all for any new tech that will get us off fossil fuels, and it's true liquid H2 still has an edge on energy density by volume, but for a giant oil company to try to toot their horn on this is absurd on the face of it.
3175 2018-03-08 17:09:40 Adrienne I do not support adding phlegm to tea but it's still a better idea than oil of bergamot
3176 2018-03-08 17:09:31 There are hidden costs involved with cars as well. Steel isn't just structural, it's used in the molds to make all the plastic parts. Also, canned goods, new housing framing, gas and oil pipelines, medical equipment... the list goes on and on.
3177 2018-03-08 17:09:28 I’m working on getting back into art and exploring new media’s that I haven’t before. Might try oil paints or oil crayons.
3178 2018-03-08 17:09:28 No, on second thought, let farmers process oil from avocado seeds to save on transport and maximize profits
3179 2018-03-08 17:09:20 The main difference is that Petro is backed up by commodities such as oil.

3182 2018-03-08 17:09:11 Hilarious. America nationalized Venezuela's oil industry & filled it with incompetent cronies? America stripped the Venezuelan Congress of legislative powers? America stole $4.2BN and gave it to Maria Gabriela Chavez?

3198 2018-03-08 17:07:02 Por favor interveni, por la continuidad de oil, son más de 4000 familias que se quedan en la calle, es mucha gente la que está sufriendo por esta situación,
3199 2018-03-08 17:06:52 Or don’t repeal the second amendment if you’re gonna re-classify it as a “right” because it already is.
3200 2018-03-08 17:06:34 Interesting. We always focus on physical resources like oil, land & #waterwars but I often wonder if it’s more the spiritual sig of sites that #cabal are after. #Africa, #SouthAmerica, #Hawaii, #JekyllIsland #Arizona San Carlos Rez #Apache #Geronimo Skull & Bones
3201 2018-03-08 17:06:25 In conclusion, Chavez was a master politician. The perfect maquiavelian monster. He used all oil money to further his political project and now Venezuela is bankrupt. He established a perfect dictatorship, so much so that there is no mechanism to vote out unpopular Maduro.
3202 2018-03-08 17:06:23 Seen this kind of snow fall in 1971 in Johnson County Kansas. Walked to school to only find out it was closed. Wonder why my parents sent my sisters and I to school. I remember my dad lighting a glass lantern with kerosene. Yes that's right kerosene. I keep lanterns with lamp oil
3203 2018-03-08 17:06:16 Yeah my homeboy said if you throw the oil first then mollys it'll fuck him up
3204 2018-03-08 17:06:14 $oil crude is at triple support area & 50% fubo. Very important point here. Might go back to $62 or down to $58.80

3206 2018-03-08 17:05:59 You're obsessed with this white thing. What does that have to do with oil and gas?

And how am I making anything personal? I am asking you questions.

You're very thin skinned for someone who claims to be so tough.
3207 2018-03-08 17:05:46 Dinosaurs lived for 200 million years in a 1600-6000ppm C02 environment.  Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a 1/2 mile of ice.  We have to stop squandering the oil Mother Earth gave us. And curb Pollution. Forget Climate Change its a Globalists scam.
3208 2018-03-08 17:05:34 Yeah and that oil shit xD
3209 2018-03-08 17:05:25 Norway, the third global oil exporter
The metropolitan area of Oslo, its capital city, has 1/3 population of Melbourne.

Low population density in an oil-producer country. It would be one of the last countries of the world to incentivate the electrical cars, but it's the first.

3213 2018-03-08 17:04:44 Every time I jump in and start doing an oil change my boss takes pictures for some article or something. Its a little weird.
3214 2018-03-08 17:04:28 The answer is for people too fund Hydrogen Steam Turbine-generator and Hydrogen production on board the EV this will stem the need for Oil for petrol and diesel. plus Oil for central heating Fracking becomes too expensive and Oil will have stranded assets saves a lot of arguement
3215 2018-03-08 17:04:26 I need to get my rotors & brake pads changed, get an oil change, & take an emissions test all before the end of the month...

3217 2018-03-08 17:04:15 I’ve never seen fake outrage over anything like this. Liberals want use to be voluntary slaves to Islamic Middle East oil and communist China steel. Why don’t we just shut down all Hollywood studios, get movies, tv shipped in from other countries if ya cheaper 
3218 2018-03-08 17:04:03 India's immense agro-diversity ensures that all most all kind of oilseed crops can be cultivated in our country itself. Imposition of higher duty on cooking oil will promote local cultivation of #oilseeds. #FoodSecurity #Sustainability
3219 2018-03-08 17:04:01 6. He used all of Venezuela's oil riches to further his political project while keeping the poor poor and bringing everyone down to depend on the State. Surrounded himself with narco military men invested in sustaining the government to shield themselves from prosecution.

3227 2018-03-08 17:03:20 Warned by who? A fat frog man who sells snake oil and is too insane to have his children even visit with him? Im sure they’re TERRIFIED (that you might eat them with mayo)
3228 2018-03-08 17:03:15 The Wolf Administration has entered into a questionable snake oil unsecured loan, that will cost $375 million instead of using the existing funds in special funds. They perverted the authority in the legislation.
3229 2018-03-08 17:03:12 Absolutely agree. These are stupid people relying on their own hubris and confidence to baffle their incurious followers. Like snake oil salesmen wandering through small towns at the turn of the 19th century.
3230 2018-03-08 17:03:08 My in laws just recently had two deaths from cancer. One obtained the oil (illegally ofc) and it helped stay her terminal illness for a couple years... the other refused and went through traditional treatments even though it could have potentially cured her... sooo many benefits

3237 2018-03-08 17:02:29 Oh, yea. Sesame oil rules. But if sesame seeds had a face, I would call them an Uber to drive them back home and tell them they're no longer welcome around here.
3238 2018-03-08 17:02:12 time to stock up on korean snacks and cup noodles cos I foresee myself burning tons of midnight oil for my assignments and sorts :’) 

I didn’t choose the fat night life. The fat night life chose me :’) ㅠㅠ
3239 2018-03-08 17:02:02 2. I have worked in the industry. I still do. For almost twenty years. Three continents. 5 countries. Onshore. Offshore. Drilling. Completions. Workovers. Production. Decommissioning. 

Never been SAGD or oil sands, no comment there.

3250 2018-03-08 17:00:40 It’s treasonous that all of these Republican Trump shills are apparently willing to jeopardize our nation’s safety and our democratic institutions in their paranoid frenzy to defend a despotic misanthropic snake oil pusher.

3256 2018-03-08 17:00:23 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
3257 2018-03-08 17:00:23 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!

3265 2018-03-08 17:00:01 Good for you, if that's true. Sincerely. You're now saying that that ALL oil is bad. At least that's a real argument. I get the alternative energy dream, but - again, if it's true - you're making adjustments that the majority aren't making. Do you even know why you're pissed off?

3268 2018-03-08 16:59:56 Trump's repeal of the offshore drilling ban would: 
1) lead to more oil spills; 
2) disrupt coastal ecosystems, fisheries, lives and livelihoods;
3) counter the transition to clean energy and bring on more climate havoc.
Solution: Keep coal, oil and gas reserves in the ground.

3271 2018-03-08 16:59:31 They say God blessed Texas? Lmao I say no he didn't. You need to travel if you believe this. Hell parts of new Mexico are more beautiful. No mountains just trees and desert oil. I say no I disagree.

3281 2018-03-08 16:58:27 1. So I'll take that as a no. You *do not* work in oil and gas. So, by extension, your understanding of the industry might not be the same as someone who works within the industry. It's fine, it's not for everyone.
3282 2018-03-08 16:58:23 bye i bought argan oil hairspray but it smells like dog food
3283 2018-03-08 16:58:10 I haven’t tried but if you feel how the oil feels idk if you’d want to double up on it. At least for me it’s just not comfortable since it’s sticky

3295 2018-03-08 16:56:10 There were 7 headlines this week that should bring #OIL to its knees. 

Will they? Still remains to be seen.
3296 2018-03-08 16:56:01 I learned that gasoline and oil came from the ground, so I thought all gas stations were built over places where the gas was found and it was just pumped right up. I thought it was really convenient that so many gas reserves were located right where people needed them.

3305 2018-03-08 16:55:18 Tessa’s Car Tips:
Don’t drive your car if it don’t have oil in it 
3306 2018-03-08 16:55:13 As an alternative to eye primer, try dusting powder on your eyelids twice to help makeup stay.  Try sweeping on a shadow brush of loose powder before and after you start your eye makeup. It doesn't alter the colors at all, but soaks up any oil #beautytips

3312 2018-03-08 16:54:18 There is no N11trn anywhere. 1. Check DMO 2. You don't calculate debt from external reserve bros. 3. D debt is tied down to projects& d debts were inherited. 4. At low oil price, we know d figure of external reserve and at a higher oil price, we know d figure too. Dancing time oo
3313 2018-03-08 16:54:15 Paid by... well oil.
3314 2018-03-08 16:53:46 I don't deal in 'the truth' - historians are foolish if they do. But this I know: iScotland would be in deep eco/financial doo-doo. The figures show that unequivocally. Oil doesn't save you now.
3315 2018-03-08 16:53:38 Apparently I failed to tell Irving that we sold the house & don't need oil delivery any more. "It's been a year since you got oil, dont you need some?" Wonder what the owners would have said to a random oil delivery?

3322 2018-03-08 16:53:11 Alberta can not on one hand claim BC can not constitutionally stop Oil flow to the coast and then on the other hand self righteously threaten to stop that very same Oil flow to BC.  Let the Western Bastards freeze!

3341 2018-03-08 16:51:33 Norway is a very rich country due to oil exports.
Despite that, it also runs on principles.
That's why it's not a member of OPEC nor EU.
And why so many buy electric cars.
Because it makes sense.
It's the right thing to do.
Plain & simple.
Money isn't everything. Independence is.

Now: have you worked in the oil and gas industry? Yes or no?

2) buffalo mozzarella with a generous dash of salt and pepper
3) a light sprinkle of shaved reggiano parmeggiano

3362 2018-03-08 16:49:11 For a personal carry weapon I love the M&P compact. Very accurate for a compact and easy to conceal. I had to sell all my crap during the oil bust though so I don't have it any more

3367 2018-03-08 16:48:27 i have pretty great hair though so.... it's a little dry but with a bit of hair oil.. good as gold
3368 2018-03-08 16:48:26 And I never said anything about EPA administrators, so you're just strawmanning me. But all these "competent" oil executives and weapons companies executives, and the banks and networks did push us into the Iraq War...again, so many of the cosmopolitans you deemed competent
3369 2018-03-08 16:48:19 Didn't the archbishop use to work for an oil company...they're probaby best mates behind the scenes
3370 2018-03-08 16:48:16 o ya, they still have to test the well, based on oil & gas shows/kicks all the way through the horizontal leg, this should preform very well.

3387 2018-03-08 16:46:25 Not a rigger, but I care for our rope, and I like almond oil and sometimes a mixture of it and beeswax.  I have experimented with shea butter, but the risk of it going rancid was pointed out to me, so I am sticking to the tried and true.

3392 2018-03-08 16:45:42 3. Chavez opposed Bush in public and made a lot of fuss about this. However, he continued selling oil to the US, fueling the war machine that invaded Middle Easter countries. Chavez masterfully fooled a lot of people in the process, but he and Bush were great business partners.
3393 2018-03-08 16:45:35 not really watching this garbage, getting oil changed and asked them to change the channel Fake TV!

3418 2018-03-08 16:43:12 Because foreign funding for oil is because they own the companies and have invested money in Canadian economy. Hardly the same thing as importing paid environmentalists to destroy Canadian resource based industry.

3421 2018-03-08 16:42:50 Put it in a pot, add water and little salt then allow to cook till it’s soft. Bring out your red oil, put in a plate, add salt, add onions, add pepper then your good for the evening

3434 2018-03-08 16:41:20 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

3447 2018-03-08 16:40:01 If anything, the article shines light on the real opportunity here for Alberta and makes no mention of the contemptuous issue for BC, oil tankers and oil spills. Clearly there's a greater need to build a safer more reliable delivery system for the Pacific region long before Asia.
3448 2018-03-08 16:40:00 Against drilling oil also

3451 2018-03-08 16:39:08 But you have no problem putting 10s of thousands of jobs at risk in the oil and gas industry.

3457 2018-03-08 16:37:48 Venezuela fell because they put all their eggs in one basket with oil. When the oil money dried up they hadn't yet diversified their economy. So they crashed. Have whatever qualms you want with socialism, but they're a failed petro state, not a failed socialist state.
3458 2018-03-08 16:37:36 He’s not the one backed by foreign money to stop pipelines getting our oil to tidewater...the true traitors are CDN’s in foreign employ who never say a word about who employs them or why. Same entities suppress our future while enabling their own oil and gas industry to flourish
3459 2018-03-08 16:37:34 My husband was laid off at the end of the year from an oil and gas company, still no job. Hundreds of applicants for a few jobs, the disastrous NDP is killing our once great industry. Looking forward to Kenney making Alberta Great Again.

3470 2018-03-08 16:36:05 Indeed, you cannot and at no point would i ever suggest that, but the people of Aberdeen have protested in the past.  The Brexit impact on Aberdeen, along with the Oil crash will have a huge impact on ordinary people yet the elected officals support it.

3472 2018-03-08 16:35:49 @Lowetide  I am fascinated with the shifting sands on this draft class. Some like Simon Boisvert see high skill players at 8-12 with small gaps with tier above. I am wondering if the Oil should be looking at moving a pick that isn't top 2/3 to move back to collect more assets
3473 2018-03-08 16:35:47 
3474 2018-03-08 16:35:35 What do oil companies do to pollute? They just sell oil - you’re the one who burns it in your car.

3491 2018-03-08 16:33:49 I've been vegan for the last few years, was vegetarian before. I don't even have salt or oil or sugar. But I definitely don't trust tap and bottled water. I'd do anything to give my body health, I used to be very toxic, cigarettes and poor food etc and I'm completely opposite now
3492 2018-03-08 16:33:42 I think it is.  That's the problem with fast food. Oil. This is definitely forcing you to cook at home. Meal prep might help so you won't have to do it daily.  I just ate a piece of cake not too long ago and I'm kicking myself because I'm def gonna be hurting.

3495 2018-03-08 16:33:26 No, this is fancy. When you go to an expensive restaurant, they normally give you oil with your bread. This is the same thing. Just chunky.
3496 2018-03-08 16:33:23 Dem don come. Free oil money lovers. Make God punish all of una
3497 2018-03-08 16:33:04 متخافش وراك رجاله
3498 2018-03-08 16:33:01 It’s a shame! A country that has so much oil should charge less to its people.
3499 2018-03-08 16:32:57 Min Wang, Executive Vice President, State Grid Corporation of China talks about new green electrification concept  to increase share of power in final energy consumption, moving off coal & oil and using clean power. Renewables will be dominate trend for replacing fossil fuels
3500 2018-03-08 16:32:52 Just had a fresh tomatoes and onion salad with olive oil Cuban style.  Sorry in advance to seat 13B on Delta.
3501 2018-03-08 16:32:46 maybe within EU it works trying pricing anything else commodities, oil, FFAs etc in anything other than USD.
3502 2018-03-08 16:32:42 Just because our Alaska politicians @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan and @repdonyoung are bought off by Big Oil doesn’t mean Alaskans are in favor of Ocean habitat destruction. By saving the ocean, the environment and our fisheries - we save ourselves.
3503 2018-03-08 16:32:41 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it’s royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation
3504 2018-03-08 16:32:28 That’s oil money right there
3505 2018-03-08 16:32:28 I need my oil changed.. car detailed!! Ion have no time to do shit
3506 2018-03-08 16:32:26 For the barmer oil refinery in Rajasthan the state govt has been getting a royalty of 4000cr per annum.AP asked for the same in case of  oil refinery in KG basin but the central govt is deliberately keeping the issue mum.AP should get around 3500cr as royalty per year since 2011.

3510 2018-03-08 16:31:55 Use hot red oil
3511 2018-03-08 16:31:46 @JustinTrudeau @ec_minister why are you allowing the US to kill our natural resources production? Was this the deal you made in exchange for Soros money in your campaign? Does anyone recall what Obama did after he killed Kinder Morgan? I do he opened up oil production in 1
3512 2018-03-08 16:31:41 Did you ask them if the Veterans knew they served to protect oil & grow the military industrial complex?
3513 2018-03-08 16:31:21 هههههههه
3514 2018-03-08 16:31:17 I get so frustrated when people think coconut oil is the cure for everything. Ugh. Thank you, though! I’m gonna check it out! 
3515 2018-03-08 16:31:11 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3516 2018-03-08 16:31:09 they do absolutely, i have many friends in the @BLMNational and @forestservice to be sure. i am grateful for what they do. they tweet about the sale of mineral and oil leases. it these "conservatives" who want the fame without the truth.
3517 2018-03-08 16:31:02 yup welcome to my world; literally only 5 places i can eat that won't make me sick. too many places cook w/ too much oil; now i cant be lazy w cooking at home anymore but prob for the better
3518 2018-03-08 16:30:59 @mikemahler hey mike! I recently purchased your recovery oil and was wondering if you could answer a few questions I have regarding it.
3519 2018-03-08 16:30:51 OIL DIFF: 3.58 -> 3.58
3520 2018-03-08 16:30:39 This whole time the secret to hair growth is oiling your scalp with black castor oil. I almost to year 4 since the big chop and oiling my scalp every week or so has me back at an inch+ per month as if I just shaved my head 
3521 2018-03-08 16:30:36 Agree, I think crude oil has been signaling a move higher in the $
3522 2018-03-08 16:30:33 oil change & hair cut soons i get off  it’s only right 
3523 2018-03-08 16:30:23 Got the Cabin Blues? We understand, that's why we made a scent for this occasion. Come try 'Take Me to the Cabin' made from Pine Oil with hints of Orange and Lemon Essential Oils. As a bonus you will get 10% OFF!

3527 2018-03-08 16:30:02 OIL DIFF: 3.52 -> 3.62
3528 2018-03-08 16:29:57 Oil is bad for you!
3529 2018-03-08 16:29:54 Yep..it is. Because it provides more jobs and better pay. I'm in the oil & gas industry. I like the gas pump prices rising. Job security.
3530 2018-03-08 16:29:38 The Koch’s father built oil refineries for Stalin. It seems possible that part of the fortune the Koch’s inherited was made by their father dealing with the Russians. If Koch’s do have any affection for Russians this might be the reason.
3531 2018-03-08 16:29:31 did close my oil long on the pop, didnt have time to post
3532 2018-03-08 16:29:28 Its such a joke. What do each of us spend on subsidizing the oil/energy industry, $860 a year in taxes? Leaves me to believe some people only feel safe in a cage.
3533 2018-03-08 16:29:22 I just washed my beauty blender anddddd it took almost 20 pumps of my cleansing liquid to properly wash it off  (it's 99.9% clean so I cried a river while proud of myself lol)
Maybe I should buy a baby oil and baby shampoo so I won't overuse my cleansing liquid.
3534 2018-03-08 16:29:20 Come on, really?  Many of us knew this YEARS ago.  Snake oil salesmen, all of them.
3535 2018-03-08 16:29:01 I feel a little sorry for guys who have no quads. Until I try to go buy pants and none of them fit because they’re cut for guys who don’t have quads. Then I curse them.
3536 2018-03-08 16:28:21 recommendations: something better than Murphy's oil soap for hardwood floors?
3537 2018-03-08 16:27:57 @PurpulHair hairline oil is now R200?
3538 2018-03-08 16:27:50 I use organic coconut oil
3539 2018-03-08 16:27:38 Most evangelicals are just like most repuliCONs in Gov it's all about being in power with their hand out for your $$$ to pocket and don't pay taxes.
 Like trump they all are snake oil salesman for the weak.
3540 2018-03-08 16:27:21 Probably because they know the US gov't will never do anything about it because of their longstanding oil for guns agreements. Saudi Arabia is at least as dangerous as Iran, but US will never acknowledge it.

3543 2018-03-08 16:27:00 You *should* be skeptical: Bcz not everything is as it seems when it comes to these evil corporations who deal in Oil & Energy.

But if I had the spare funds I could replace the engine in any vehicle for less than $5k.

The keys to keeping it good are lower maintenance costs.
3544 2018-03-08 16:26:58 Isaiah 61:3....
"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified."
3545 2018-03-08 16:26:38 It is very important as traders to have versatility and agility. 2 days ago it was Canadian #Marijuanastocks, yesterday #crypto oversold bounce, today #UWT #DWT oil leveraged #ETFs. If you are comfortable in every market there is always opportunity somewhere. No forced trades.

3550 2018-03-08 16:26:04 Yam and oil never came to my mind, didn't know you could get a tuber for less than 500
3551 2018-03-08 16:26:03 Trying to save time & money for your business in the #oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
3552 2018-03-08 16:26:02 I wanna know more about this CBD oil
3553 2018-03-08 16:26:01 Rachel, no matter what you do, oil worshippers will never support you. May as well go pro environment and kill the pipeline with the little time you have left in office
3554 2018-03-08 16:25:59 But... how? Wizards?
3555 2018-03-08 16:25:41 Well I'll have to now! I do quite like the smell of oil (except gearbox and axle!) but not as much as petrol, thinners and new tyres.
3556 2018-03-08 16:25:24 Ah, so it's a legal limitation instead of a technical impossibility.
The situation in the Antarctic might change drastically if the ices starts melting and oil runs out in more accessible places.
3557 2018-03-08 16:25:06 いやいやいやそんなｯｯｯ
私の方こそ気を使わせてしまいすみません
惚れただなんてそんなふうに言って頂けて本当に嬉しいです!
あぁ～もう本当私の方こそごめんなさい泣
初めて話す方との距離感が難しくて...oilさんは全く悪くないんです
3558 2018-03-08 16:25:00 I'm sure no birds are harmed in mountain top removal, coal ash deposits, vented methane from drilling rigs, oil slicks from offshore drilling, spills from pipelines, tanker ruptures and CO2 from power plants.
3559 2018-03-08 16:24:24 Help @Boilerjuice - I'm out of oil and the order I placed two weeks ago has not arrived. I cannot get through to the supplier! #heatingoil #heating #noheating
3560 2018-03-08 16:24:18 This nigga done gave me some oil lol
3561 2018-03-08 16:24:07 As it happens I'd be planning to use it in marine seismic oil exploration control systems but that's another story :)
3562 2018-03-08 16:23:34 I drink my vitamin c out of a stemless wine glass everyday and the fuel oil delivery guy is probably wondering why I’m drinking before noon on a Thursday 
3563 2018-03-08 16:23:34 Used some of my cbd oil earlier to calm myself, it did help.
3564 2018-03-08 16:23:31 Peppermint oil.
3565 2018-03-08 16:23:26 Hubby read it somewhere now he won’t take it. I use Evening Primrose oil and papaya enzymes. Don’t use Prilosec unless I have to. So hardly ever. I’m sticking to natural as much as possible. Seems like pharma creates these drugs, don’t report all side effects, then create another
3566 2018-03-08 16:23:13 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
3567 2018-03-08 16:23:09 i don't agree with all his stuff but it sure turned on a dime when it looked like sh*t. All at lows now/then: Russ, cooper, crypto & oil than they turned on a dime as the S&P and DOW spiked up hard again. $ chasing just a few stocks and the magic happens
3568 2018-03-08 16:23:08 Mostly just caught up with everything else in the market. The sharp pullback early Feb took everything down. Oil topping out and pulling back didn't help, dollar bottoming a bit didn't help, rates moving up definitely didn't help energy stocks. They are just out of favor for now

3571 2018-03-08 16:22:33 Neutrogena has an oil free eye makeup remover, it works wonders. Walmart has an off brand version of it, it works just as good. But it leaves your eyes soft and hydrated and you won’t breakout. I breakout with oily stuff. The amount of make I used to wear, it took it all off.
3572 2018-03-08 16:22:31 For those people it is and always has been primarily a business. Their "faith" is merely a commodity to be traded like cattle futures to the highest bidder. They are nothing more than snake oil salesmen peddling misery and hate.
3573 2018-03-08 16:22:11 @what_is_style We hear you there. Have you taken care of the oil change?
3574 2018-03-08 16:21:58 My mum drank a 2ltr bottle of water each day, I'll never the forget the day she was cooking and sat the bottle beside a bottle of vegetable oil. As she was cooking she went to take a glug of water only to have downed a hefty amount of oil. #IWD2018
3575 2018-03-08 16:21:57 Again.. oil 

273.5 IMO will be ceiling here with everything else factored in 

Look for small cheap puts for a scalp 
IMO
3576 2018-03-08 16:21:51 I have supplies and I really want to attempt painting (like oil painting, though I would LOVE to learn digital painting) but I'm half terrified of it, XD
3577 2018-03-08 16:21:36 Oil falls with U.S. output climb pushing prices toward a 3-week low. #SUACCS18
3578 2018-03-08 16:21:21 "Oil money" petty 
3579 2018-03-08 16:21:15 Doo grow hair oil.
3580 2018-03-08 16:21:13 Luke: I said oil cannot be *SIMULTANEOUSLY* 1/13 and 1/30. You offer me the fact that market prices move (over 4 months). Agreed, market prices move over time. For my next trick, I am going to be in two places at once...
3581 2018-03-08 16:20:49 I need to get an oil change today but I feel like crap and the weather jake
3582 2018-03-08 16:20:17 @CaptAbhimanyu This time oil depo/ station in village Daata, hoping in your next tenure in 2019 you will bring refinery to #Narnaund Constituency. More power to you
3583 2018-03-08 16:20:04 You got that right. When all the cheap money and tax cuts finally run out, it is going to be a disaster. What I really can't wait to see is which oil stock has to borrow money to pay their dividend first. Should be a nice short LOL
3584 2018-03-08 16:19:55 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
3585 2018-03-08 16:19:51 I just took HC so won't take cbd oil, better to vape it as it won't require immediate filtering by the liver
3586 2018-03-08 16:19:51 I had a similar experience. “These people are nuts. I don’t want anything to do with whatever they’re smoking.”
3587 2018-03-08 16:19:38 @SullyCNBC You need to see Helima Crofts piece on Phantom Liquidity in Oil Market. Btw congrats on WWE move
3588 2018-03-08 16:19:37 i want pecho unli rice and chicken oil rn 
3589 2018-03-08 16:19:36 an essential oil infused bolt of lightning
3590 2018-03-08 16:19:34 I just need that Oil block.
3591 2018-03-08 16:19:27 City don't charge f mascot experiences. So all our oil money can't be blamed for other clubs charging mascots, or will the likes of @MirrorSport blame that on us as well? Like the fact Barca won't play Dennis Suarez because they don't want to pay his fee per game contract?
3592 2018-03-08 16:19:14 Not only that, they also stole all the money required for investments an maintenance of the oil industry therefore causing a sharp reduction in oil products at the same time prices dropped plus cash loans to pay with oil making everything worst
3593 2018-03-08 16:19:00 Did you know the Koch brothers’ father was a co-founder of the John Birch Society?

Did you know he brought Soviet engineers to US for training?

Did you know he built an oil refinery for Adolph Hitler?

3595 2018-03-08 16:18:42 I'm here for an oil change but waiting for them to come out and tell me after inspection my car has been totalled for 2 weeks 
3596 2018-03-08 16:18:35 yeah i read about the castor oil thing & debated it for about 2-3 days but decided not to for the same reasons.
3597 2018-03-08 16:18:32 I think Anas is saying: it is short term oversupplied which has led/leading  to a non sustainable investment model which in the long term,  will result in an energy crisis because of lack of investment due to his two points.  It is what guides the cyclical nature of oil prices!
3598 2018-03-08 16:18:13 Your so called Nazi leader is creating jobs for the US and raising its dollar where we can barely afford gas. 
Our PMs solution, ram a pipleline to China to give our oil away.
3599 2018-03-08 16:18:10 Oil was 1/13 oz on Sept 18, 2014.  SGEI opened Sept 19, 2014.  Less than 4 mths later oil was nearly 1/30 oz, as gold continued flowing to China in large amounts.  These are the facts - I am open to alternative explanations.
3600 2018-03-08 16:18:08 Oil isn't doing u any favors.  Or Dxy 
But spx don't care today
3601 2018-03-08 16:17:57 Tell the #SaudiArabia lot to G.T.F and stay away from Scotland's oil .
3602 2018-03-08 16:17:51 #IfIHadASuperpower #hepaticman We only use our liver to 10% of its capacity. What if we unleashed its full power. As Hepatic-Man, I could drink oil spills or Pabst Blue Ribbon and pee out fresh drinking water. My weakness. . . 
3603 2018-03-08 16:17:51 Need $WTI to crack $60 (close now) & sell down hard. Still holding $DWT & want to add to $BP from lower after a big fall in oil prices. We'll see how it plays out
3604 2018-03-08 16:17:41 Liverpool vs Manchester United....no game is bigger than this one in EPL ....they spend as much oil money they want..but still this game is . 
3605 2018-03-08 16:17:36 scan flagging oil names... starter position on $USO May 12 calls  @ 0.62
3606 2018-03-08 16:17:27 I don’t know if they actually worked but I was praying they did!  the only thing I didn’t do was the castor oil or whatever because I heard it could harm the baby or some shit.
3607 2018-03-08 16:17:16 You know they only support "states' rights" when it is about guns, oil, or bigotry.
3608 2018-03-08 16:17:06 Isn’t oil on the track dangerous?
3609 2018-03-08 16:17:05 The ESEIA report was swept under the carpet. Not implemented. Actually Thange community demonstrated today against KPC oil spill mishaps. #KpcThangeOilspill

3612 2018-03-08 16:16:37 Nonono, when I say risk I mean to the arbitrager. Ex: simultaneously buy oil in TX at $13 and sell a contract to deliver in China $62 (not realistic but bear with me). What if the Chinese buyer doesn't pay? What if they change the price? What if ships are blockaded? Im bankrupt.

3617 2018-03-08 16:16:24 While we may be set to be a grand oil producer it doesn't seem to effect domestic cost.  Ripping up the country cost to cost is what it's costing us now.  Also, I thought we were going to hold onto our reserves.  You are costing the future generations of this country.
3618 2018-03-08 16:16:03 Russia is a wealthy country (in terms of natural resources), has a fully developed industrial base and has a talented, educated and industrious people. Economic improvement during record high oil prices was inevitable, Putin tries to take credit for everything

3625 2018-03-08 16:15:08 And oil was the WW2 commodity making Rockefeller the 'richest man' [Not richer than @RoyalFamily or Rothschilds of course]. For WW3 (which is already on0 data is the new oil. That's why @BillGates @JeffBezos are top of the 'richest man' race.

Makers do ensure quality, consistency, and take pride in their work.
Makers don't do well in a factory.
Makers thrive on shaping their craft while burning the midnight oil.
We're made, not produced.

3652 2018-03-08 16:11:19 1/2, that's like saying if a steel meter stick is 3 rubber bands in length in one place, and 4 rubber bands in another. Meter sticks are not measured in rubber bands, and gold is not measured in oil.
3653 2018-03-08 16:11:15 WTI crude is testing support ahead of a three-week low Watch for a break in oil
Just a quick heads-up. WTI crude has come under steady pressure today, partly because of the strength in the US dollar.
WTI crude is down $85 cents to $60.28. A break below last week's low of $60…
3654 2018-03-08 16:11:15 Oil is finite. Oligarchs and DJ launder money for access to oil. Renewables are our weapon. Shame on you.
3655 2018-03-08 16:11:12 Dems, like GOP, have bigspecial interests, also known as SuperPacs which are funded by big banks, big oil, Rx co, health ins companies, etc. & they donate hundreds of thousands of  to their campaigns.  That’s called an ‘investment’, now they want a return on their investment.
3656 2018-03-08 16:11:10 Pf. Go to Hungary and see what poverty is. But I Think the US should care about Venezuela because is an oil type. Don't you guess that?

3665 2018-03-08 16:09:28 How ironic that the oil and gas sector uses the tag line of "Tomorrow's energy explained". Fossil fuels aren't tomorrow's energy, they're yesterday's. Tomorrow's energy will be from solar, wind, tidal, and other #RenewableEnergy sources. Step up and lead Canada to renewables!
3666 2018-03-08 16:09:12 there's a Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shiv Pal Yadav, Laluu Yadav in every rogue state, you gotta keep them greased, with oil, butter & honey 
3667 2018-03-08 16:09:02 The two main differences are that is the first currency launched by a government and the second one is that is backed up by commodities (such as oil, for example)
3668 2018-03-08 16:08:48 Check out some #MAGA accounts, there are oil paintings, outsider art type stuff, of Jesus behind Trump guiding his hands in signing government documents, with radiant light coming into the Oval Office. Very creepy.
3669 2018-03-08 16:08:48 European countries that voted against the US and Israel @ UNGA over Jerusalem as the capital of Israel their OIL companies would be expelled from the Rep of Biafra namely Shell UK, Agip of Italy,Total of France to be replaced with US Oil companies led by Exxon Mobil

3672 2018-03-08 16:08:20 Just look at Jim Justice in West Virginia--the people voted in a Democrat for governor. Immediately after being elected he flipped to Republican and started giving huge handouts to big oil at taxpayer expense. In many places throughout the country we have no real voting options.
3673 2018-03-08 16:08:16 I need to be tryna get my oil changed 
3674 2018-03-08 16:08:15 Wait my man don’t eat fruit? His nut probably taste like motor oil.
3675 2018-03-08 16:08:14 No oil mess, no soggy oven wings, nice little puddle of grease in the drip pan tricking me into thinking they were healthy. Not quite as good as getting oil fried wings out somewhere, but for the ease and cost of homemade wings I give a 10/10

3682 2018-03-08 16:07:49 I’m waiting to get my oil changed & surrounded by a dozen construction worker men who smell like cigarettes & grease & i couldn’t feel more out of place as i sit here wearing red lipstick, drinking out of my weiner dog bottle & eating a bowl of Rice Krispies
3683 2018-03-08 16:07:49 I really want an essential oil diffuser.
3684 2018-03-08 16:07:46 Liberals seem to have no problem living in a world where we are dependent on someone else for basic materials and resources.   Does no one see that we are no longer dependent on foreign oil and what that means to our security and prosperity?
3685 2018-03-08 16:07:46 like i cooked it in corn oil
3686 2018-03-08 16:07:39 put on some calming essential oil and my body is actually rejecting it and now I’m sweating and stressed about how much I’m sweating

3704 2018-03-08 16:04:28 You're so right, Shawna. They also did nothing to prepare Alberta for the days when the price of oil would shrink and sales would drop. That's what Premier Notley is now trying to make up for and Albertans should get behind her. Happy International Women's Day!
3705 2018-03-08 16:04:27 never going to happen. Dallas is the hub of too many backroom handshakes, deals made by #NewMoneyWannabes trying to abolish the poorest areas and be the NYC of the South, but lean towards the @GOP. you can mix oil and vinegar all day long, but it'll always separate. #John Chase
3706 2018-03-08 16:04:27 #oil drives large parts of inflation -many weak hands in $wti 60-65 range, and have essentially come off.

3713 2018-03-08 16:03:11 that’s what I did & it worked! I was dilated to a 5 1/2-6 when I got to the hospital & they asked what I’ve been doing and I told them I soaked in the damn bath and cried while eating bdubs.  I got so desperate I even took primrose oil pills.

3732 2018-03-08 16:00:54 On top of that Tillerson was well liked in Russia for Exxons' work with Rosneft. Was he hand picked? Russia needs the oil in Crimea. Someone who would work to lift sanctions too.

3745 2018-03-08 15:59:02 When I was 21 back in the early 90's I worked my butt off at Cargill a seed oil processing plant and I bought a $40k sports car.  That car got me pulled over prob at least 50 times.  Cops would accuse me of being a drug dealer and question why I had a nice car.  I'm white.

3754 2018-03-08 15:57:25 Genocide,  regardless of victim is NOT okay. 

Dunno if you're old enough to remember boycotts of Shell Oil regarding their support of the Dutch minority and apartheid. Btw,  when the roles WERE reversed,  "we" didn't care.  Look it up.. Why do we care now?
3755 2018-03-08 15:57:18 these reefs and trees aint meant to be destroyed the way we did. the ocean aint suppose to be plastic & oil. the air aint suppsed to be toxic. we have strived far from harmony bruh. ya it can be divine plan but this aint how we suppse to treat our mama.

3762 2018-03-08 15:56:19 Do Americans not care what Trump is doing to the US and the world? He's taking away protected land for money, he's promoting oil for money, and allowing guns to be in the wrong hands for money! He's not a leader, he's a crooked business man, Only thinks about himself & his wallet
3763 2018-03-08 15:56:13 We can wean ourselves off Oil JT. I think it's a good long-term plan. Gotta be mindful of how we're altering the plantery climate you know. Although I have read that global warming will actually prevent the next Ice Age from happening, which is definitely a good thing.
3764 2018-03-08 15:56:07 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.

3766 2018-03-08 15:56:03 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

3769 2018-03-08 15:55:15 So if California can do this, does that mean the rest of the states can start making new laws that Trump federal law? I bet the gas & oil co’s would love that! I guess the Dems in D.C. are setting a bad example for the Dems in Cali about not following the rule of law! Sad

I pulled in to get my oil changed and I didn’t need to do anything besides tell them my last name. Plus its FREE.
3772 2018-03-08 15:55:13 I'm personally fine and now living abroad...but I tend to detest and want to fight the brexit lies and deliberate misinformation from JRM/IDS/Redwood like snake oil salespeople that will hurt those least able to afford it.
3773 2018-03-08 15:54:47 Why did I agree to get this oil change at 8:00 am smh 
3774 2018-03-08 15:54:41 If you told me rosehip seed oil was specially extracted from an angel’s teet I would totally believe you.

3778 2018-03-08 15:54:17 @SecretarySonny  Please continue your support of biofuels; utilizing a fuel that takes a year or less to be produced vs oil, which has taken hundreds of years makes sense to me and hopefully to you.
3779 2018-03-08 15:54:17 For start-ups in the oil industry, it's an uphill task. A lot of statutory/regulatory certifiates to be procured before you start business. It is quite suffocating.
3780 2018-03-08 15:54:14 That’s the gods honest truth right there.
3781 2018-03-08 15:54:11 Governments have and still do subsidize the conventional (fossile) energies far more than renewables. Fukushima (not only) was mostly handed over to the tax payers. The costs for wars for oil/gas as well, not to speak about the costs of environmental damages and climate change.
3782 2018-03-08 15:54:07 @FoodBizNews Our NEW Fryer Fuel Advantage is the most advanced frying oil! It has an oil profile that is similar to heart-healthy olive oil & fills the void in the industry for a healthier, more cost-efficient way to fry. Your readers would want to know about this!
3783 2018-03-08 15:54:04 3) Why Sevak visited Pak without invitation & thereafter Pathankot & many more attack..
4) Why Doklam back off?
5) Why we're paying double price for LPG & highest price of oil when International market falls?
I'll provide more but first u answer these 5 Question.
3784 2018-03-08 15:54:00 off of coins not it Bitcoin is in my hot oil for long-term and will be other than that I do not watch it
3785 2018-03-08 15:53:55 Yes!!  I just got some CBD oil for my kitties!!  And they don’t seem to mind it. Calmed down the anxiety level and I’m going to try it for travel!
3786 2018-03-08 15:53:55 So you are in an eco bubble. That is same argument oil industry makes.....
3787 2018-03-08 15:53:37 The EU is not a dictatorship. The EU needs to become more democratized, but even democracies do things that locals don't like, like building prisons or garbage dumps or oil rigs. Mr. Trump, for example, has changed rules about dumping waste from coal-mining operations.

3789 2018-03-08 15:53:30 My sister gave me a bottle of Balance essential oil bc she knows I love that blend & when I got home I told Parker about how it's good for anxiety and depression & he was like "have you been feeling okay literally" he was so concerned & genuine it was so sweet 
3790 2018-03-08 15:53:10 Today cauvery river is flowing. Who knows ? Due to climatic change it may dry too? We should solve it scientifically. We shd learn from middle East countries. Their oil is going down too. But Dubai other countries r promoting tourism in big scale.
3791 2018-03-08 15:53:08 Trade it to Canada for Alberta, we got lots of oil just sitting around doing nothing.

3799 2018-03-08 15:51:47 Speaking of "pipelines", if an oil pipeline in MN burst causing $100M damage to clean up, would #mndfl pursue criminal charges? Of course. So why will they give a free pass to $100M fraud that is MNLARS?

Also re: pipes, when will #mngop see that legal cannabis spells "liberty"?
3800 2018-03-08 15:51:39 Take some peppermint oil or something to rub under your nose. The NYC summer is beautiful but the trash is RIPE 
3801 2018-03-08 15:51:31 勢いある会話って凄く素敵だと思いますよ

3802 2018-03-08 15:51:27 I try to avoid artificial sweeteners and after a while I just leaned to Lindt 90% chocolate bars. Sometimes I’ll coat macadamia nuts and once I did mix unsweetened coconut with coconut oil and peppermint in candy molds and cover them in chocolate. They were pretty good.
3803 2018-03-08 15:51:26 The other way to look at this is that ~85% of a barrel of oil winds up as gasoline, diesel, and tar, which means we either burn it or put in on roads. That ~85% of the volume is only ~15% of the value.
3804 2018-03-08 15:51:18 I made a whole batch of oil and have done nothing with it smh
3805 2018-03-08 15:51:14 I’ll finish your tweet. “Oil and gas are great, when left in the ground for future generations  to access if needed, which they most likely won’t have to do because of cleaner, cheaper alternatives.”
3806 2018-03-08 15:51:09 Oh, not to mention what working in the oil sands has done to them physically. It’s really sad.
3807 2018-03-08 15:50:50 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.
3808 2018-03-08 15:50:45 Said Jennifer’s great great uncle, swilling down case after case of snake oil
3809 2018-03-08 15:50:37 Watching the emerging crap surrounding MoviePass and I keep hearing ‘Data Is The New Oil’. It is not a new phrase, but it struck me that if true (it isn’t) then corporations obviously view people as vessels, silos, containers … whatever, but certainly not as people. #PeopleFirst
3810 2018-03-08 15:50:34 EVERY time I come to get an oil change they always tryin to make a bihh spend extra money
3811 2018-03-08 15:50:15 Oil + weak USD =

3813 2018-03-08 15:50:09 1. you cant get palm oil 100 ANYWHERE
2. 200 beef would be like two pieces of meat 
3814 2018-03-08 15:50:01 Make us more energy self sufficient? There's me thinking it was used to manipulate oil prices 
Check out how it works in the States. It's got nothing to do with self sufficiency
3815 2018-03-08 15:49:49 So you don't have a girlfriend then? Who was the last girl who called you who wasn't your mum? Or does even your mum think you are a nob? Just cover yourself in oil and talk to men about your throbbing engine. That will make you feel better. Brum brum.
3816 2018-03-08 15:49:47 Out and about finna get an oil change. The ladies in the itty bitty tittie committee mad as hell at you on today! huh
3817 2018-03-08 15:49:41 Except the republicans are only representing big money,big oil, not the average person.
3818 2018-03-08 15:49:37 I have, but I mostly went with "dump devastating information out there early, make sure my death draws too much attention to data that's deadly in itself."

Also, being the apparent 6/23/14 catalyst of the oil peak & collapse starting 6/24/14, I was already committed by Nov 2016.
3819 2018-03-08 15:49:35 Agreed! Also, the answer is clearly avocado oil.

3822 2018-03-08 15:49:06 Why wld I pay a non authorized dealer to change my oil for 200 dollars  I might as well go to the dealer
3823 2018-03-08 15:48:57 I think it’s many ‘progress cultists’ saying otherwise. Whether it’s oil, meat, cars etc., some people need something to believe, something to be, and something to do.
3824 2018-03-08 15:48:47 I had my first butter and mct oil coffee today and yeeessssssssssss
3825 2018-03-08 15:48:41 Estimates for the Argentine soybean crop in the market have fallen well below the 54m tonnes currently seen by the USDA, with some figures reportedly as low as 40m tonnes, and the lowest that Agrimoney has seen from a well-respected analyst the 42m-tonne figure from Oil World
3826 2018-03-08 15:48:39 Descending triangle, oil and spy diverged.  Trump tweets have kept away a solid dip by scaring herd IMO.

Soon down, just look at wti.  Crushing record longs
3827 2018-03-08 15:48:28 So I dropped my car off for an oil change they asked when do you need it - I said in time to drive to the #LAKings game of course!!!!!

3829 2018-03-08 15:48:22 Trying something different today.....diffusing lime with red Mandarin oil today. Smells fruityyyyyy
3830 2018-03-08 15:48:20 My family are greatly affected by this. Two of my brothers are journeyman electricians, another a journeyman welder. They’ve been working oil & gas about 20 years. Years ago I urged them to take courses related to solar energy or anything other than oil. They didn’t listen. 
3831 2018-03-08 15:48:13 When I first cut it, I used Sportin’ Waves and coconut oil; I wash my hair on Wed & Sat and now that I have them, I only use coconut oil and EcoStyle Argan Oil Gel. I don’t brush 24/7 and I only sleep with a wave cap.

3834 2018-03-08 15:47:31 I just hope that a) they give it to a country that is suitable for hosting a summer tournament b) it isn't an oil rich nation/a country that has appalling human rights record. Is that too much to ask? Probably.

3843 2018-03-08 15:46:29 I'm no expert but my first thought is why would an oil rich country like Saudi Arabia be interested in sustainable energy?
3844 2018-03-08 15:46:29 I deliberately didn’t leave so that if it did that and they had questions they could ask but no one asked. My car is in the oil change bay now but two people that came after me were put there first
3845 2018-03-08 15:46:25 yes! 

Or a huckster at a carnival, selling snake oil.

Oh wait, he became that too.
3846 2018-03-08 15:46:19 I think most the oilers will, betcha if 10 bounces went our way instead of against us in the early season we’d have had a different season, bad bounces led to lack of confidence imo
3847 2018-03-08 15:46:10 Yes, not to mention Exxon has ($500 billion dollar) oil drilling rights in Russia that they can’t use until the sanctions are lifted! Hmmm, seems like draining the State Dept and installing ExxonRex was a great idea!!

3876 2018-03-08 15:43:12 @chicksonright You can get CBD at fresh thyme.  (Greenwood) Been using it for migraines and knee pain for a couple months.  Get the peppermint. Tastes good. Put a dropper full of oil under your tongue. Pain relief felt in a couple minutes.  Works best on empty stomach. Good luck.

3887 2018-03-08 15:41:45  I have dry skin so foam cleansers are best for me cos others are too drying. I’m using coconut oil to remove my makeup, then a cheap foam cleanser from the Mr Price of the UK (Primark), and Neutrogena’s deep cleanse in the shower. 

it depends on your skin type.

3893 2018-03-08 15:41:29 No, no. I've been assured by many a Britbong these past 3 weeks that there aren't shootings in Britainistan.  Someone tell the chap to get up and stop fooling about.
3894 2018-03-08 15:41:26 California...stands against him on oil rigs.
Oregon...first state to pass a gun control law after school murders.
Washington...fuck Trump and his bigoted immigration bs!
Yep. Proud to be on this side of history.

3898 2018-03-08 15:40:37 Citizens United is the reason Congress rarely does what we the people want. Companies, industries, organizations, and super wealty buy the politicians, and in turn, demands are met. NRA pays = no gun laws. Oil pays = squash solar. Koch Bros pay = big tax cut. This must end.

3903 2018-03-08 15:40:25 Babe, clean it with non iodized salt and water every night and put tea tree oil every morning. It’ll dry the bump off and it’ll make it smaller. Trust me it works. Try using hoop for that one too. You’re less likely to get the bump again.

3908 2018-03-08 15:39:55 Wouldn't be the first time that's happened. The most productive oil field in Norway was once Danish territory. The fisheries minister redrew the border for a good bottle of scotch, giving it to Norway. Obvs. before oil was found.

3911 2018-03-08 15:39:03 if you are feeling nauseous, lightheaded, or have a headache :

The medium of story telling via oil painting every frame in the style of Van Gogh was inspired.

4036 2018-03-08 15:25:27 I absolutely agree.  We need to get rid of NRA, Oil Corps., and Big Pharma puppets - that’s Cruz all the way.  I also have no respect for his antics.  I have been very impressed with Beto though and am hopeful the wave will get bigger in November.
4037 2018-03-08 15:25:19 Timing and targets don't lie. After Raqqa was reduced to a parking lot, US solely focused on 'liberating oil fields'... Most of them through agreements with tribes loyal to ISIS than through fighting. Not so much interest for Syrian populations in villages..

4040 2018-03-08 15:24:47 Trumpster better watch they are coming for your land next.  Even just passed law said you have no rights to land When it comes to oil and gas leases
4041 2018-03-08 15:24:40 Shout out to @juneroughead on #InternationalWomenDay who once checked the oil in the car by licking the dip stick ... what a woman!
4042 2018-03-08 15:24:31 Feel like Trump and his tweets has delayed the rugpull making herd bearish last weekend.
  No matter it comes soon enough, oil weak and decoupled from spx
4043 2018-03-08 15:24:29 @CBSThisMorning @GayleKing @NorahODonnell @jdickerson I know you all get paid well (rightfully so). Do NOT exaggerate the impact of $75 monthly from GOP so-called tax break. It's enough to help pay bills, buy groceries or get an oil change. Not enough to do something "great."
4044 2018-03-08 15:24:21 @realDonaldTrump If the PETRO DOLLAR AHOLES give u any trouble, create a Gasoline card for all americans, that they have to pay all gas and oil bills with. Also the stock holders have 2 use this card to buy gas and oil stocks. and their GAINS to be paid out on the same debit card
4045 2018-03-08 15:24:06 Measure seven grams of olive oil then set timer for 3 minutes.
4046 2018-03-08 15:24:02 @DanielBoulud Our NEW Fryer Fuel Advantage is the most advanced frying oil! It has an oil profile that is similar to heart-healthy olive oil & fills the void in the industry for a healthier, more cost-efficient way to fry. It would be great for your restaurants!
4047 2018-03-08 15:23:58 Because oil
4048 2018-03-08 15:23:50 probably the worst person to ask. I have no feel for this market all year. The Eur i think collapses to 1.18 in coming days /weeks. But oil , no clue
4049 2018-03-08 15:23:47 Something is wrong in Texas. Maybe it's in the oil i can't call it.
4050 2018-03-08 15:23:43 Hey oil cons. You don’t need extra help you got trump for that. So good luck suckers lol

4052 2018-03-08 15:23:29 As well, I love how he says talk on oil remains bullish, yet all of the "related headlines" at the bottom of the article are bearish.  Media has been nuetral to bearish, at best, same with EIA, IEA.

4065 2018-03-08 15:21:49 If it were up to you and your theories, we would have no coal, no steel, no aluminum, no oil, no natural gas because other countries can produce it cheaper. All we have left are waiters and professors in transgender studies.
4066 2018-03-08 15:21:46 One step further. After that one weirdo beats egg whites and oil into something, how do they convince everyone else to do it? Without YouTube‽

4072 2018-03-08 15:20:57 We can't currently compete with the big spenders (neither can the Gooners for that matter). Better that we adopt an approach where the coach brings young players through to learn a system that will see us continue to compete with the oil rich countries who own these teams.
4073 2018-03-08 15:20:34 Too bad Oil is a dying industry. China is the leader of the future in regards to energy.
4074 2018-03-08 15:20:33 Atheism doesn't require advertising. There's no snake oil to sell. Religion on the other hand loves advertising & appeals greatly to the hard of thinking. There's your crossover with populist Trumpism.
4075 2018-03-08 15:20:24 Last month, Zinke announced a proposal to eliminate several protection and safety requirements intended to protect communities from methane pollution by oil and gas drilling on public lands.

4087 2018-03-08 15:19:20 At the start of 2018, Zinke announced the Trump administration's plan to open most of America's coastal waters to offshore drilling for oil and gas.
In September, Zinke changed regulations to allow seismic testing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

4091 2018-03-08 15:18:53 That's a liberal talking point, do your research before you flap your lips about nonsense.
Trust me. solar can't do it yet. Wind energy needs to be created by oil use, in addition the steel utilized is made from coal as well. All of the "dirty resources" are actually necessary

4097 2018-03-08 15:18:08 Good time to remind people that the dems in the legislature voted against a 5k teacher raise and an 100% oil and gas tax increase
4098 2018-03-08 15:17:56 Ever State that hinders or prevents oil exploration & development should pay a subsidy to those States that provide them with petroleum products. The mentality of "Not in my backyard" should have consequences.

4145 2018-03-08 15:12:41 Oil is a crowded trade waiting to get kicked in the teeth. Same for bonds. The same players are short bonds & Long oil. Unwind will be ugly. Equity positioning has already unwound. Positioning in other assets held steady as Vol stayed low. I expect equities to sit this one out

4156 2018-03-08 15:11:51 both - its irrelevant though as oil products have different codes in different countries and different duty rates - Germany code for my product is different to UK code - there is no single market in practise - its a myth - CHIEF and ECMS - all electronic - no checks - no delays

4164 2018-03-08 15:11:14 Excellent. I’m traveling from Texas to Toronto soon: what kind of oil repels polar bears and...are snow snakes a thing?

Seriously though, have a margarita, some Tex-Mex, and some BBQ while you’re here. I hope you enjoy your time in the Lone Star State.

4173 2018-03-08 15:10:07 Still reliant on oil in the 21st century. Going forward in reverse.

Olive oil.

Who says that? 
4175 2018-03-08 15:09:59 Been on a mission since 7:30.. got an appointment to get my phone fixed at 11:30... another appointment  to order a new oil cover thingy since the snow was nutty and literally cut through my shit ...  but if I don’t do anything else today I’m getting that iPhone X
4176 2018-03-08 15:09:47 How long does it take for an oil change 
4177 2018-03-08 15:09:46 Might be a collection of grease from all the potato waffles? I don't know, it dripped oil. Sad toaster.

4180 2018-03-08 15:09:23 The seemingly rich proceedings from crude oil, who is mismanaging this resource?

Let's get down to specifics that are being mismanaged by the citizens, sir. I've mentioned the Ajaokuta Steel, you are yet to state who mismanaged that resource.
4181 2018-03-08 15:09:16 markets about to turn hard. Look at oil and bonds

4190 2018-03-08 15:08:18 The Romans used to clean themselves with olive oil since they did not have any soap. They would pour the oil on their bodies, and then use a strigil, which is type of blade, to scrape off any dirt along with the oil
4191 2018-03-08 15:08:16 i just slathered my hair in coconut oil and now i’ve got a four hour trip to take yeet my hair better be the softest
4192 2018-03-08 15:08:02 Not much really... maybe when you use some of the fresh dough, flatten it and fry in oil till golden... top with icing sugar.  Home made beavertails. . Essentially still fresh bread.  Lol
4193 2018-03-08 15:07:58 Financial crisis is not a cycle. Another way to look at it: It's hedging my huge oil position..

4196 2018-03-08 15:07:52 I think you need a break from the Kool-Aid they're giving you, as everyone knows billions of taxpayer corporate welfare goes to the oil companies, plus the KPMG help to hide their illicit gains overseas! Time to cut off the public funds, as they're need elsewhere like schools etc
4197 2018-03-08 15:07:50 You are aiding the US and all countries who import oil to the US!

4203 2018-03-08 15:06:59 No I didn't. That was your interpretation & I clarified regardless. U implied that the prediction was a hit on current GDP. U still don't understand. GDP WILL NOT CONTRACT BY 5% OVER 15 YEARS. IT WILL GROW BY 20%.  5% is a $20 rise in price of oil. Next to nothing. Stop trolling.
4204 2018-03-08 15:06:50 Which is Russia’s end game.  Other than nukes and oil they don’t have a whole lot to bargain with.

4208 2018-03-08 15:06:07 It's not their fault.  They filled a hole left by people looking down on these trade careers preaching college.  Now we can't afford college and no one knows how to change their own oil or work on their own house.

Of course, and rightfully so. But when state wastes $100M on MNLARS asks for $40M more... Give them a pass? @reprickhansen @JimNashMN
4224 2018-03-08 15:03:29 If your gold-to-$50,000 theory leads you to think that oil can be simultaneously $62 and $12, you should rethink your theory! :P

4230 2018-03-08 15:02:44 True, oil bloc owners in Nigeria (I don't know how many) might have gotten theirs through illegal means and there's no moral justification for that. 

And Rev Sister Alakija said that because most churches/mosques celebrate her and invite her to their high table.

4297 2018-03-08 14:57:09 Look, this is silly. If oil sells for $12 in one place and $62 in another, then anyone who can buy in one market and ship to the other will do so. Until the price gap closes to a level just above shipping cost.
4298 2018-03-08 14:57:07 Stop making sense, and peddling your practical and sensible ideas. This is America, we have antiquated coal jobs, and oil Barron wallets to protect.  #GreenEnergy

No

4326 2018-03-08 14:53:40 I remember I went to get a $20 oil change for the first time and they changed my filter and I didn’t know that was extra - my shit came to $70 I wanted to cry man

4328 2018-03-08 14:53:36 "They all"? You mean all politicians? Of course all federal politicians are all about the oil, it's a matter of national security. Our currency is based on oil, if big oil goes down, so does our currency and way of life.

Dressings are probably the biggest culprit. Simple oil & vinegar dressings, with not a lot of sugar are your best bet. Or buy yourself a bottle of yogurt-based creamy dressing at the grocery.

4360 2018-03-08 14:50:10 They want to invade Syria and the Middle East. HRC proclaimed what great business opportunities are there. Syria was also for running oil pipelines thru, this would hurt Russia. These people are sick. They more than likely have sinister plans for Africa as well.
4361 2018-03-08 14:49:50 I did see that Exxon has written off that big oil deal with Russia since they've recognized the reality that the sanctions aren't going away anytime soon....so yes, they made a ton of money, but not as much as they thought Tillerson would bring in.
4362 2018-03-08 14:49:48 BTW Syria really blew up after the government wouldn't let pipeline to be built that moved oil to Turkish oil refineries.

4417 2018-03-08 14:43:13 Saudis are doing a lot more of late to clean up their act, because they know we won't need the oil much longer. So yes, Iran remains the greatest exporter, both in terms of men, materiel and direct financial support. Keep laughing, though. It's good for you!

You cannot have oil for $62 and $13 at the same time, or if you prefer 0.01 and 0.05oz gold. It is a fantasy. A silly notion concocted to justify some cockamamie idea...

Don't forget to check those tires for wear & tear, have your mechanic change the oil, and tune up the motor with a hotter burning sparkplug for your return trip, reducing time between Rocky Point and the border.

4484 2018-03-08 14:35:25 Tillerson pledges "new aid to Africa" and gives "speech" to donors in Virginia.

I agree completely, and this is one area where I differ sharply with some of my esteemed colleagues in sustainable asset management who continue to hold shares in oil supermajors for purposes of engagement. Wondering if you or 350 have an opinion re divest vs engage.

4495 2018-03-08 14:34:00 I’m eating a piece (or two) for breakfast. I used oil instead of melted butter because I didn’t have the energy for more steps. The top crust is definitely yummy.  The insides taste good but have an unfinished mouth feel. I’ll make this again.
4496 2018-03-08 14:33:56 Going to Louisiana in May to fish the oil rigs is probably going to be the highlight of my year
4497 2018-03-08 14:33:50 Bro best bet is to invest in a oil pan and do it yourself. A lot of places over charge for how easy it really is, I payed once and after that I just learned to do it on my own.
4498 2018-03-08 14:33:48 B/c in this admin's worldview, *business people* should rule the world. These are the people who believe that wealth s/ be distributed to ppl through corporations, Cabinet posts s/ go to rich ppl, that overturning the elected Mosaddegh govt to "take the oil" was a good idea, etc.

4592 2018-03-08 14:23:46 I am an admitted meliorist but I do think a lot of Randian ideas are on their way out (for now). Lots of power entrenched with oil there. Very limited future.
4593 2018-03-08 14:23:44 6/23/14 "someone" mentions that algae can produce unlimited natural gas from biodigesters, & oil thus has a cap of $25/barrel w/conventional GTL tech.

Oil peaks the next day & begins collapse.

5004 2018-03-08 13:31:53 This might be rightly termed as a threat to national security. But what can a common mwanachi say @FauzKhalid when kleptocrats are in power? Soon Kenyans will know what it means what a country enters 'State capture' by Kleptocrats, just wait until that first barrel of oil is out

5007 2018-03-08 13:31:23 Very interesting your comment on recent @Saudi_Aramco take on #strandedassets: "It is the private investors that own companies such as @Shell , @BP_plc and @exxonmobil that are most at risk. These investors are exposed to 88% of the spending on unneeded oil and gas projects."

5015 2018-03-08 13:30:20 To keep global temp rises below 34.7 F: “Global emissions would need to peak soon, then fall to zero around 2060. Coal must be killed off by 2050; oil sooner. Renewables must account for 60-80 percent of power, and carbon-capture remove 30 years of CO2 by 2100” and I thought

You aussies really live life on the edge.
5019 2018-03-08 13:29:23 Oil supplies have a limited life span while growing corn is sustaining. The complete transition to corn biofuels must start at some point. Surely oil  can be used for more important projects? Unless the photo has been doctored the sky behind the Valero sign is remarkably clean.
5020 2018-03-08 13:29:22 Whole SouthEast suffered , mainly due to decline in oil prices..probably by beginning of summer it should reverse
5021 2018-03-08 13:29:17 I believe the penalty for a driver that does not the run a Particular series (Woo or Lucas oil) are different then if you run there series, the  Sanctioning body's at times show   Favoritism to the driver that run there series, just my opinion
5022 2018-03-08 13:29:13 Dwindling oil revenue yet this govt spending huge money to search for oil in d desert.. Does that makes sense.. Regionalism it is... We have many governors that are lazy mentally.. If we have slim federal govt then states can develop and federal focus on more important thing

5076 2018-03-08 13:21:30 We need some form of check and balance though. Unless we are going back to regional govt. Which is what I truly wish for. Maybe the west can focus more on agriculture rather than dwindling oil

Remember that even if you've created a product or service that's legit and adds to or advances "the game" it doesn't make everything else that came before irrelevant.

5145 2018-03-08 13:12:57 Norwegian primeminister Solberg is struggling. Oil minister Terje Søviknes from the right-wing Frp is in search of sexual assault year back. Her president in the Norwegian parliament, Olemic Thommesen, has been fired from his post due to outrageous financial management #hardday
5146 2018-03-08 13:12:55 BASTARD--flying flags over their headquarters to signal they are in charge while turning over public lands to oil drillers excepting his home state of Montana (Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke)
5147 2018-03-08 13:12:41 America is in great need of blue-collar jobs in case some have not noticed. The original states were the first in steel, railroads and the oil that built this country. 1000's of small downs devastated from closures. Good job Mr. President. Please continue rebuilding America.

5156 2018-03-08 13:11:38 Without risk capital, skill (know-how) and labor...the oil is nothing more than buried treasure. The average Venezuelan has lost 28lbs in the last 12 months.

5165 2018-03-08 13:09:48 Yeah, the oil companies might be forced to clean up the mad max disaster they left behind.

5176 2018-03-08 13:08:32 Trudeaus have been oil people for generations! Liberals are always for their own interest. Giving  taxpayers dollars to the UN under the guise of charity and donations, just to claim it back for themselves. Certainly none of it  has reached those suffering worldwide #laundering

5185 2018-03-08 13:07:31 Jenn said that the oils didn't work that way. Apparently  I needed to have an essential oil lifestyle, which seemed odd because as I understood, "lifestyle" is a word you use when you need to treat queer experiences like just a hobby. And I already had a hobby-- doing poppers!

5197 2018-03-08 13:05:18 and even when you have the above it might still be not worthy: in the case of shale oil, it takes a lot of energy to extract a little bit of surplus energy (EROI of shale is very small) so in the end it becomes pointless.

5207 2018-03-08 13:04:16 No mention of palm oil! Also too little about the vital role grazing livestock will have in rebuilding/maintaining soils used for plant-based foods. It is about manures & composts and it is about grazing in rotations. Maybe they should attend the Oxford Real Farming Conference!

5210 2018-03-08 13:03:48 I agree. There are oil & gas majors increasingly engaging with the transition. Ed's point is that is always going to be easier culturally not to confront the enormity of the change coming.

5229 2018-03-08 13:00:58 Well with our increased oil production DTs bankrupting Russia. How’d you feel about Obama’s concessions to Russia
5230 2018-03-08 13:00:50 Then don’t be surprised when Canada shuts off your oil that you get from Alberta, shuts off your electricity that you get from Ontario and Quebec and refuses to sell you the raw materials you need to make steel.

Must have 2-3 years in the oil & gas environment.

Deadline is 12th of March.

5255 2018-03-08 12:57:04 Just to maintain balance, let’s not forget that there are even more amazing and incredible women fighting to protect oil, gas, and coal companies, and block the commitments made in Paris. @RachelNotley, @lraitt, @TGranicAllen among them.
5256 2018-03-08 12:56:56 If you had studied it, you'd know about words like theory, law, and hypothesis.  High horse, indeed - that's like claiming you studied fine art while claiming oil on canvas refers to subway graffiti, then telling van Gogh to get off his high horse.

5283 2018-03-08 12:52:44 Get comfortable with the fact that you’re gonna be there for long. Make playlists, bring a coloring book. Bring a little “wake up kit” face wash, lotion, scented oil (I recommend lavender it puts you to sleep) lol I know random but it’ll help when you’re about to land

5285 2018-03-08 12:52:13 I’ve seen this in my research in Tharaka Nithi county. So much produce is going to waste. New markets, maybe new ways to process produce (mango juice? Avocado oil?) would be transformational for those communities. Sharing economy apps for mobilising these assets?
5286 2018-03-08 12:51:56 I have faith in Talbot. Montoya, not so much. Not sure if Arizona will resign him or what type of contract he’d want but Rannta would be a great 1b for Talbot.

5292 2018-03-08 12:51:07 Has anyone noticed the Oil Companies love to keep raising the price of gas. In the Spring its for the "More costly Summer Blend" and in the Fall, "Its the more costly Winter blend", which is it?

5294 2018-03-08 12:50:27 Right. But with oil companies running the world those won’t be made in high numbers
5295 2018-03-08 12:50:14 Any chance we'll see water or some other kind of liquids/fluids added? Possibly oil? Which is of course flammable.
5296 2018-03-08 12:50:03 Frankly we need to embrace more quickly home grown non oil based energy and develop alternatives to arms dealing so we don't have to double standard cosying up to such regimes.

5319 2018-03-08 12:46:33 The possible deposit of vast oil on Gambia’s offshore is stale news. We were told about this discovery during the Jawara era. It was said then that it’s too expensive to exploit the oil reserve.I say the sooner the better for the ailing economy!

5322 2018-03-08 12:46:27 All you have to do is drop your car off at the shop and they will do the oil change and inspection for you. You need to take your insurance card in to show them you have insurance or they will not do the inspection. If you renew registration online they will mail you the sticker
5323 2018-03-08 12:46:23 Yup not a good source of stable oil supply
5324 2018-03-08 12:46:18 fox news YES!! Oil Independence ..Thanks to a well calculated plan by President Obama, we have reached independence where we need not buy any foreign oil to exist... As a matter of fact we can now export and sell on the open market...

5414 2018-03-08 12:29:55 USA has closed 55,000 factories. We built China & paved the streets with gold in the Middle East. Do you remember President Jimmy Carters famous speech about the earth will have no oil left by the year 2000. Liberal idiots believed that garbage & they still are.

5418 2018-03-08 12:29:28 @Sarahetodd I wonder if you could offer some advice. I am a geophysicist working in the oil and gas sector for best part of 15 years. I have a background in non-linear optimisation problems. I'm looking to broaden into data science. Recommend any MSc courses in UK? Thanks

5429 2018-03-08 12:26:54 I am so embarrassed about our American society. All they seem to care about are their guns, oil and big truck. One of these days they will realize they have destroyed the only planet we live on by saving endangered species and saving the land.
5430 2018-03-08 12:26:46 I don't need a knight in shining armour. I've got coconut oil. 
5431 2018-03-08 12:26:42 One of my new favourites is butter beans a fried in olive oil, salt, pepper, and chilli flakes - I happily eat them cold as a snack; same goes for chickpeas when roasted in the oven. Or fry butter beans + add to creamy garlic mushroom + spinach, which is also nice at room temp.

He's a wolf for the oil, coal, & gas industry. He's probably rated well with the #NRABloodMoney. We need real liberals. Take Nancy too

5445 2018-03-08 12:24:28 Umm follow up question: if the US only produces about half the oil it consumes (US EIA), how does keep its economy going with skyrocketing gas prices?
5446 2018-03-08 12:24:27 Oil is back 'cause we're drilling again, fracking, and the PIPELINE your beloved Obama BS'd his way to killing. Coal plants roaring again to make electricity AFFORDABLE! Mfg. lost to no investment, regulations,and bad trade deals- but it's coming back!
5447 2018-03-08 12:24:02 Oh, and the socialised allocation of oil wealth.

so, indeed next time, no official reason to bomb #SAA when taking Omar oil fields.

5467 2018-03-08 12:20:11 Today's schedule: car repair, oil change, wash last round of dishes and clothes, close my PO box, finalize packing, call three different utilities, write a book. Not an entire book, I'm a little tight on time.
5468 2018-03-08 12:20:10 I'll say it.  If it were sensible policy it would easily remove the BM.  As it stands it is a dismal shade of legalization that will not achieve the stated goal of removing profit incentive from BM.
How's the BM doing in corn and corn oil?

5518 2018-03-08 12:12:37 Terry, profit and environmental concern do co-exist in the development of oil in few place on the planet. Canada is one of these places.

5555 2018-03-08 12:07:12 Would love to listen to an episode of @Trade__Talks that feature the ongoing spat between the EU and Malaysia (+other palm oil exporting
5556 2018-03-08 12:06:52 I just bought a cool new Alienware PC Most people actually have eleven toes, not ten! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Dogs all have chips in their brain and spy for the government!
5557 2018-03-08 12:06:38 Oh.. I am in the oil and gas field.

5559 2018-03-08 12:06:24 1. Make sure the oil is very hot before putting it in
2. Make sure the pase is thick (not too thick) but not watery either
3. Use a small spoon (eating spoon) for now to do the scoop you're putting in the oil till you get the hang of it
5560 2018-03-08 12:06:23 Fell asleep watching blue planet...
And all I could think about is how we are destroying the worlds most beautiful and fragile ecosystem with the pollution of plastic, oil, and overfishing...it makes me quite sad honestly.
5561 2018-03-08 12:06:20 Oily skin try African black soap. Now that stuff STINGS but it works so don’t cuss me out if you try it. And you can mix it with some tea tree oil because that helps with acne and dark spots too. Then a little witch hazel to tone and a moisturizer
5562 2018-03-08 12:06:15 Oh i see.  Sorry  so you're lucky cause ur face boleh tolerate dgn mineral oil.  Mostly olive oil atau baby oil mesti ada mineral.  Kalau you pakai okay,  just keep on pakai. Kulit orang berbeza2. I ingat you tanya je,  rupanya you dah pakai 
5563 2018-03-08 12:05:57 Makes complete sense. Interesting time for aviation globally. One can just hope oil does not play spoilsport.
5564 2018-03-08 12:05:50 yeah yeah oil de ur head my dear

5569 2018-03-08 12:05:06 Backed by an oil field, the Ayacucho, which hasn’t been drilled yet. Oh, and guess what. Their rig equipment is breaking down due to lack of maintenance. Skilled drillers mostly fled. I’d say it’s differentiated as being ghost crypto.
5570 2018-03-08 12:04:58 Was kidding, mostly. I really dislike coconut oil (flavour doesn't agree with me). Kale is great in a salad with fried tofu and peanut dressing.
5571 2018-03-08 12:04:47 hehehe ka mahal sa oil painting d ko afford :)
5572 2018-03-08 12:04:46 Using that barometer, how then would you judge Guardiola, whose spent a small fortune allegedly building the Premiership’s ‘greatest team’, in comparison with someone like Burnley’s Sean Dyche, who has operated on the sniff of an oil rag?

5580 2018-03-08 12:03:23 We never know when the economic cycle is going to end.  Because cycles are difficult to time, commodities typically outperform during the latter stages of the cycle.  2007 was no different. Front month crude oil futures went up 130% in '07 just when the economy was about to crash

5614 2018-03-08 11:56:41 Blocking of Canada’s oil is about Global competition for oil including the US government. It does not matter if Canadian oil is produced by Boy and Girl Scouts. Canadians who care have to get involved and fight back against eco-terrorist such as Bill who are payed to mislead.

5637 2018-03-08 11:53:04 It always baffles me that Spurs are so unpopular. Maybe it's because we play attractive football? Because we aren't backed by oil money or ludicrous riches?

5666 2018-03-08 11:48:29 10GW of electricity will be produced onsite by 2023, saving 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Great milestone to pursue for.

5678 2018-03-08 11:46:44 Interesting story! Those numbers of doctors that can give it are crazy! The drugs I take are the same as those w epilepsy which I read CBD oil works well with. It’s similar to the way my condition works too. I would prefer a natural product than chemically made medication anyday.

5680 2018-03-08 11:45:31 It’s too cold to practically have no heat. We have been without oil since the end of January. Just using a heater in the kitchen and running the furnace on a cycle and then turning it off. Conserving oil. It’s past the E mark
5681 2018-03-08 11:45:24 Or even engine oil
5682 2018-03-08 11:45:22 Ok Ted

5684 2018-03-08 11:44:00 I had to turn back too Mike. I think the A59 was closed prior to the snow due to an oil spill yesterday. The snow just got in the way then around the diversion!

5688 2018-03-08 11:43:34 I think we still have time to correct our mistakes. Before we go the way of Nigeria where states spend all the money on salaries while saddled with debt. At least they have a revenue source(oil) and a huge economy. What does Kenya have?
5689 2018-03-08 11:43:32 Has he styled his hair with the todays oil leak?
5690 2018-03-08 11:43:22 The borehole is fixed! Hurray.

5889 2018-03-08 11:11:33 Do you seriously believe Sunrise oil and gas will ever be developed in East Timor? It’s a pipe dream. Creates unrealistic expectations for the people of East Timor. And diverts much needed energy away from building a sustainable economy. Australia’s deceit separate issue.

It just isn’t right  and she doesn’t even do anything special

6002 2018-03-08 10:43:31 There is a problem because the middle distillate market is already tight. All the fuel oil cannot be converted to diesel and with the only new crude feedstock coming into the being shale which is low middle distillate, the middle distillate market could become very tight

If they hadn't seen rain by week's end, fee was refunded.
6008 2018-03-08 10:42:33 Well she is the Minister of Finance and that involves looking for ways to finance and raise money for the government to execute projects and implement their plans and policies. With the fall in the price of oil, tax is the next option since we are a mono-economy.

6012 2018-03-08 10:40:57 I am not saying there isn't a problem, just that the IMO side of it is not a big deal. Until a few months back, the market for fuel oil was extremely tight, now there seems to be plenty

6035 2018-03-08 10:36:50 these new units are doing is allowing russia to convert material they already sold to other refiners. These refineries will mean russia reducing export of crude/residue/fuel oil and increasing export of products. It is just shuffling where the products are produced.

6037 2018-03-08 10:36:04 Nigeria operates almost a mono economy which is dependant on oil export, and by 2030 crude oil would be obsolete as many countries are keying into clean n renewable energy. We are not even making plans of diversifying our economy.

6121 2018-03-08 10:21:47 That's 50 years away. Big oil will not give the pipelines away. Bill Gates and Warren Buffets have to much invested in oil now. Their lobbiests will hold it up for 20 years alone. These are just studies. The existing pipelines can not handle C02.

6177 2018-03-08 10:10:54 Amol Rajan, 'Data is not the new oil because it is superabundant, it's more like sunlight than oil, and it can be reused.' #ipgsc But what metaphor do we use, is it capital or labour, or something else? Important as the data economy is our new reality. #ipgsc

6203 2018-03-08 10:05:57 Looks like the only cake we'll get to eat is fish cakes. Brexit Britain apparently has an economy based entirely on fish. Fish cars and planes, running on fish oil. Fish money. Fish hospitals staffed by ex-rays. Cod philosophers. Mullet hairstyles. Racing from Haddock.
6204 2018-03-08 10:05:37 Natural resources? LOL. Have U ever read about KG Basin nd obulapuram? KG basin is the largest oil resource for India. South India do have natural resources which r enough to develop our region. Don’t bark like a dimwit

6207 2018-03-08 10:05:02 That was what got us into the recession in the first place. We were dependent on oil and the savings were stolen by the thieves that were in charge as you've seen. The present government is really trying to revamp other sectors with agric being a low hanging fruit

6212 2018-03-08 10:03:18 I would recommend you try to keep all the brains you can in your own country.

As for exports, diversified exports are the best idea. Venezuela is in trouble as it exports practically only oil, and has nothing to fall back on when oil prices go down.

6223 2018-03-08 10:02:31 You were talking about 1973. A lot happened in 1973 that was nothing to do with the common market. Large tax cuts in 1972 and low interest rates led to a consumer boom and inflation. In 1973 the price of oil quadrupled adding to the inflation.

6292 2018-03-08 09:48:23 Oh, what a relief :) We thought it was something more serious than that. We understand how one might not like broccoli but it's so good for you  If you don't like it steamed, have it roasted, with a bit of salt, vinegar and olive oil. Just a friendly suggestion 
6293 2018-03-08 09:48:04 W Bush's administration was low life RHINO's that formed STOP TRUMP... after they finished their 1997 plan, to invade Iraq for the oil. oh yeah... they also predicted 911??
6294 2018-03-08 09:47:27 Definitely the Dischem brand Tea Tree Oil. It worked really well to clear my scars and even out my skin tone. It's about R60 for a bottle that lasts about a month if you use it wisely. 

I also used Cuticura to moisturise and it's not more than R30.
6295 2018-03-08 09:47:27 I still have Seoul stationary residue from 2001. But South Africa? Who would've known? I found a good bookshop in J'burg, an ok pen in a grocery story come Post Office in Kalk Bay, LPs in Muizenberg and recycled oil can guitars in Cape Town.

6312 2018-03-08 09:42:11 No big economic fallouts. but hiccups, yes.if PAK's blacklisted the procedure is disarm nukes by IAEA. Countries generally put sanctions, but Iran is also on the list as of now but India & Iran have strong oil for arms ties. So no doomsday scenario but not a smooth road either.
6313 2018-03-08 09:42:00 If you are aging, you should take good care of your cognitive health. One good way to do is by replacing butter with a few tablespoons of extraction virgin olive oil. Doing so every day will greatly reduce your risks of developing Alzheimer's.

6353 2018-03-08 09:31:38 This statist ideology towards business in Nig. has to be killed. You want the country to Mill rice, produce oil etc.

& somehow still regulate them. 
MADNESS!
6354 2018-03-08 09:31:37 Aside from the minor mistake of describing Iran as an 'Arab terror regime', it's kind of coherent: we want the money and oil and we don't care about the human rights abuses and war crimes.

6402 2018-03-08 09:20:06 It's a bit of confusion between brand and ingredient.

Eg: UK doesn't grow coconuts but you can buy UK brand of coconut oil from supermarkets.

Oman doesn't grow Tea, but Mumtaz tea is still known as an Omani brand or product.

6464 2018-03-08 09:09:56 You can run all the fuel oil you don’t use through crackers etc but you will never convert it all to diesel. You maybe lucky to acheive 40-50%. Therefore you still need more middle distillate production from crude. Also cokers need vacuum residue which far heavier than fuel oil.

6820 2018-03-08 07:51:34 As a Canadian I laugh at this. Canada is the largest oil importer of oil into the US and the largest trading partner period. Go deal with the middle east for oil. China and India are begging us for our oil....and minerals and lumber and meat.

6829 2018-03-08 07:48:36 The diesel for IMO will come from cracking residual fuel oil, demand for which is falling due to IMO. Masses of coker projects around the world right now.
6830 2018-03-08 07:48:23 Thank you for responding. I have been tweeting about this for the better part of two months. They will say that. It's Al Jazeera and no one wants to believe the brutality going on in Libya and Yemen against African refugees. The int'l bodies of justice.. all talk no action. Oil $
6831 2018-03-08 07:48:04 My understanding is that refineries require huge amounts of capital. I do think fossil fuels are on their way out (first coal, then oil, finally gas); I'm dubious that it makes sense for us to build new refineries.

6846 2018-03-08 07:42:47 As crazy as it sounds trying to dry out your oily skin makes you overproduce oil because you’re pretty much stripping your skin of natural oils in your face. Using an oil (certain oils) on your face can help balance the production of sebum to make you less oily
6847 2018-03-08 07:42:28 Just approve oil exploration and mining permits...Get back the money they Wasted
6848 2018-03-08 07:42:19 they’re actually called Montgomery glands! n they secrete oil to help make breastfeeding and cleaning easier
6849 2018-03-08 07:42:05 I sympathize (I have friends who live on Burnaby Mtn) - but I think it's still true that our ability to clean up an oil spill, even if limited, far exceeds our ability to deal with climate change. If we don't throttle back our demand for fossil fuels, we're facing a bleak future.

6862 2018-03-08 07:39:31 If i may, all oi/gas is used to rebuild, in country. US has more than it needs produced, at home. Exports home fuel being more. Where older policies were likl=ely the case to capture oil. We have gone 'green' and need less and less fossil fuel. We are cleaning up a mess we left.

6872 2018-03-08 07:38:18 SA's role in OPEC remains pivotal, but at bottom the USA produces enough of its own oil for its domestic purposes.  The politics of oil and Islam are very complex.
6873 2018-03-08 07:37:43 Butter is tasty when you eat it with bread. 

Butter is delicious when you eat with rice. 

Oil is strong when you eat only with butter. be careful.

6875 2018-03-08 07:36:57 Good. More than 160,000 olive Ridleys were slaughtered on the Odisha coast during last 16 years due to lack of sea patrolling ! Indian Oil Corp gave Rs. 1 crore for turtle protection 18 years ago! Money spent first to buy a Maruti Esteem for PCCF in 2003 not patrol boats.
6876 2018-03-08 07:36:57 After what was supposed to just be an oil change became an emergency repair AND oil change, I got to thinking-Where's the @GoodRx for auto repairs? I wish I could've pulled up a card that would've given me a % off my repair service instantly, ya know? #SoMuch4MyWeekend

That is cool. You have to live with that.

6888 2018-03-08 07:34:30 I think oil is still a big part of the answer but I agree there must be other factors at play.

6891 2018-03-08 07:33:50 I agree. Once England has paid back Scotland for all the oil revenues Scotland graciously lent England over the years Scotland should be set free.

6897 2018-03-08 07:32:52 There's a reason for that and I'm still not 100% sure what it is, because it's been a while since 'oil' was the auto-answer to that question.  My current theory is 'Mecca".

6935 2018-03-08 07:22:10 And America and Britain and their love child, Israel, are destroying the middle east.

6954 2018-03-08 07:17:13 Venezuela finds itself in the situation their in because of  American sanctions and embargos,US gov wants to cripple the state in order for US companies to come in and drill for oil (they can't do that on state owned land)
6955 2018-03-08 07:16:57 I would recommend using the body shop. The tea tree oil sets. Work wonders fer me
6956 2018-03-08 07:16:54 It's now 6 days and we have no electricity in meyrick park. They say transformer oil was stolen. I wonder why zesa take so long to respond to such faults. Does this mean they do not have oil in their stocks or they are now accustomed to poor service delivery

6960 2018-03-08 07:16:23 Also the most important thing to any physical crude oil seller is that they have a lot of repeat buyers. It stops their crude being under the control of buyers. Shale has very few repeat buyers. Exxon to their refineries in UK, Italy, France, Germany, Holland an d Thailand.

6963 2018-03-08 07:15:31 I reckon they would have 2 change ALOT if Africa was self sufficient. The gold, oil and diamonds alone would put them way above most.

6967 2018-03-08 07:15:10 Not much energy is generated with oil. Speeding up the ICE vehicle to EV transition and finding alternatives for plastics would make more impact on our oil consumption. 
6968 2018-03-08 07:14:59 Why would the same potato be less calorific and more satisfying ?  @ianringrose posted a similar result from frying in beef fat compared to frying in oil. British fish & chips has been a staple for decades only in the 70 "s did the chillies convert to "healthy " oils

6988 2018-03-08 07:09:38 Can we stop referring to them as skeptics? They intentionally deny scientific fact and prioritize policy that enriches their friends and donors in the oil and gas industries. They enable the destruction of the planet for $$.
6989 2018-03-08 07:09:37 I am not opposed to renewables. I have no interests in oil and gas or coal. But I need to know renewables can replace fossil fuels on a large scale under all circumstances in order to abandon fossil fuels. I will not jump off a cliff, hoping to grow wings on the way down.

7031 2018-03-08 06:58:42 This is reassuring. But doesn't mean that it can't happen. The liability coverage should be major to ensure we're not paying for the clean up. As for the other problem, the oil industry needs to pony up cash and long term jobs to FN folks cuz this is the way to get agreement.

7045 2018-03-08 06:55:50 So I doubt they do the recall legislation. They won't repeal the Carbon tax. They should repeal REDA but won't.

7227 2018-03-08 06:15:33 Wonder if these companies will be back in AB when Kenney ascends the bitumen throne? It's curious that the AB government seems to be aligned with specific oil and gas companies (the chosen) and not all of them. Or am I just imagining that some are in and others out? Feels like it

7233 2018-03-08 06:14:58 What the public fails to remember is that during the worst economic crisis in 2008, it was the strength and royalties of the oil patch in conjunction with sounder banking principles which carried Canada through said crisis.

7235 2018-03-08 06:14:31 Just one question to expose this deceitful write up... Largest economy is determined by GDP...the biggest contributor to Nig's GDP is oil... What became of oil price when Buhari stepped in?.... Can Nig determine global oil price to its advantage?...

7247 2018-03-08 06:12:14 I'll bet the oil sands were targeted b/c they're visually dramatic (easy call to action), reserves are big, it's foreign (less blowback than targeting California's far-dirtier Kern Valley), and nearby (Venezuela's also-dirtier oil is too far away & abstract). My $0.02. :)

7255 2018-03-08 06:11:07 KM has clearly stated once oil is loaded put onto an oil tanker at Vancouver or Prince Rupert Port, it will no longer be their responsibility.  Taxpayer bail outs are inevitable if shipping companies are not legit or upstanding in their industry.

7367 2018-03-08 05:48:30 Maybe I should go to IHOP or Denny's to get some hash browns while getting my car's oil change...
7368 2018-03-08 05:48:04 Why there are no catch cans? Are crankcase breathers not allowed to connect to the intake plenum after filtering oil?

7376 2018-03-08 05:46:04 You mean i have no right to heal? But i have a right to kill. That seems twisted. And germans are only not free because we have no oil. ... the last statement was just a joke. Sorry. Couldn't help myself.

7379 2018-03-08 05:45:34 I think I am a typical fan.  I don’t have anything against Spurs.  Why?  Because they don’t win anything.  Maybe I am a bit annoyed by the Poch-love, the “Kane is uniquely great” stuff & the diving is acceptable Argentine tactic, but Spurs are a proper team, no oil. #mufc =hated

7397 2018-03-08 05:43:16 So could try some bell peppers sauteed in olive oil with some garlic and pine nuts (just a few minutes so it doesn't lose its flavor or texture), seasoned with a bit of sea salt, basil and balsamic vinegar.

7399 2018-03-08 05:42:47 Now, I've been trying to figure out if the flax oil I've started taking has caused some tightness/heaviness in my brain w/ increased depression.

Maybe it's not working along w/ my antidepressant for some reason.

But I think it's better now, actually.

Maybe on to cod liver oil
7400 2018-03-08 05:42:28 Both Israel and Erdogans were trade partners in selling ISIS' oil
7401 2018-03-08 05:42:21 Most environmental problems are local, so the politics isn't difficult; we know how to clean up an oil spill. Climate change is way more difficult. We (BCers concerned about climate change) should not lightly discard a once-in-a-generation chance to get AB on board.
7402 2018-03-08 05:42:18 for tahini: you can probably replace it with any nonsweet sesame paste as long as you add lots of oil so it has a liquid/honey consistency

Obviously, guys aren't happy with their current predicament nor is the coach. That said, I don't see a team that's quit on the coach, not even close
7406 2018-03-08 05:41:37 True for US needing #ISIS, not for #SAA. Everytime US battled ISIS in DeZ was to counter SAA advance.
1. Raqqa after Aleppo liberation and Tigers moving towards the Euphrate.
2. The Oil fields campain when SAA liberated DeZ city
3. Abu Kamal race
7407 2018-03-08 05:41:04 got to read the scientific facts  first before jumping to conclusion but we do understand you're mistaken us with palm oil . no harm done
7408 2018-03-08 05:40:54 It's not, it's actually rather common. Mining is limited by the controlling cartel to keep the prices up. Sort of like what OPEC used to do with oil.
7409 2018-03-08 05:40:52 Perhaps we should ditch our pretensions of global power? We can I'll afford them and they often just cause more problems (Iraq...). We certainly should've followed Norway's example in using our NS oil/gas money to create a SWF. We just squandered it instead.

7509 2018-03-08 05:19:18 Sorry but this guy is a stooge... his actual ownership in the Bears Den was minimal and for some odd the reason the 4 Oil execs that did own it are no where to heard from or seen.  It's a Wag the Dog UCP version

7514 2018-03-08 05:18:48 Not sure. There is some US oil protest. Maybe it’s as simple as traditional drilling OK, mining for oil, no OK.

7517 2018-03-08 05:18:24 Hair oil ga bikin lepek asal ga dipakai tiap hari dan tiap habis keramas aja (kalau misalnya keramasnya 2 hari sekali). Kalau rambut pendek n keramas tiap hari, pakai 1 pump cukup.

7522 2018-03-08 05:17:59 New Zealand is primarily an agricultural-commodity producing economy, meat & dairy products in particular, as opposed to the metals & energy commodities of Canada & Australia. Thus NZD plays a weaker relationship than CAD & AUD to the prices of gold, silver, & oil.

7530 2018-03-08 05:16:16 That angle is a stretch, yes. But why aren’t they protesting their oil? Usa now an oil super power. We have enough enviro horsepower here. Why ignore their own back yard?

7535 2018-03-08 05:15:22 A great strategic play. Food producers can learn from this. Collude, make your product scarce for a year or so, and then increase prices. Voila a new price point. Oil does it. Why not food and water? 
7536 2018-03-08 05:15:15 I experienced some #neuropathy today. I take cbd oil to help with it. I try to avoid coffee. You're supposed to also avoid alcohol & gluten in most cases. But I drink gluten free beer sometimes or a highly fermented Kombucho:) I manage it well also with meditation.

7548 2018-03-08 05:13:38 Yes, just think how much better off we'd all be if people without an education were in charge of the markets, oil tankers and public health. Good thinking.

7580 2018-03-08 05:08:34 I use coconut oil instead of butter
7581 2018-03-08 05:08:18 Ga juga kok.. wanginya tetep enak2 aja. Conditioner wanginya lebih tahan lama dibanding shampoo. Jadi ga terlalu nabrak sih menurut saya. Terus kalau pakai hair oil, wangi hair oilnya yang lebih awet drpd conditioner.
7582 2018-03-08 05:08:16 Transformers of the oil-filled type can be put out of commission if you pour water, salt water, machine-tool coolant, or kerosene into the oil tank.
7583 2018-03-08 05:08:10 As an exporting nation, it is critical that our products are transported to markets in a timely and reliable manner.  This will preserve our reputation with other countries as a preferred supplier. #potash #crops #oil @SKGov @CanadaTrade @TransportCan
7584 2018-03-08 05:07:52 There's one problem with all of this. Most of the dilbut carried through TMx will go to Washington & Calif refineries, no discount relief. That's,  in part, why KM bought 18 Jones Act oil tankers over the last few years.
7585 2018-03-08 05:07:45 Haha that oil money. I think money is not an issue at this point we just want more leisure time 
7586 2018-03-08 05:07:41 Been sleeping on that coconut oil but not noooo more
7587 2018-03-08 05:07:36 Obama killed coal, oil, manufacturing, even immigration...face it ALL WEALTH comes from the ground.
7588 2018-03-08 05:07:23 ·...Mr. Minister (Again in Vancouver) ...Are you concerned about the amount of debt that is held by Canadians? – “very much so, interest rates will likely be going up and given oil prices the Canadian economy may slowdown”... See all the obvious Inconsistencies???

7590 2018-03-08 05:07:12 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
7591 2018-03-08 05:07:06 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7592 2018-03-08 05:06:41 Dtfl take the off with coconut oil
7593 2018-03-08 05:06:15 CBD oil Biggs. My husband and I and our little boy will begin to pray for you Joe. Stand strong solider!
7594 2018-03-08 05:05:29 I gotta put coconut oil on my face, do my nails, and watch Netflix while I sit & wait 
7595 2018-03-08 05:05:24 Most if not all oil is shipped by rail car. I suspect lots of meal is as well.
7596 2018-03-08 05:04:30 How is canola oil shipped after crushing?  Im assuming that some of the tankers we see have prairie canola oil in them too but, I don’t really know.  Does anyone know if canola oil mostly goes east or west or south?
7597 2018-03-08 05:03:28 PSA if you ever need to unstick a mouse from a glue trap, just pour vegetable oil around them and it will help them unstick. Then they can be put back in the wild. 
7598 2018-03-08 05:03:28 Again Pierre - time to take a break from Twitter. Let’s see a link detailing the “billions of corporate welfare” funding the oil sands?  Last time we checked these were public companies investing their own capital?
7599 2018-03-08 05:02:54 Got my diffuser on with my stress oils. Tranquil oil on my spine. A couple hits from my pen... bout to sleep like a baby.

7610 2018-03-08 05:00:20 We may never get our lands back if they're already being developed by coal and fracking for oil. Trump is undoing every regulation and protection as well as trying to get rid of our rights  too.

7628 2018-03-08 04:57:07 I preached to my entire sorority the importance of wearing sunscreen over spring break, but my smart self thought it was a good idea to go straight to 0 SPF tanning oil. 

Needless to say Im a hypocrite & my white Wisco snow skin is now looking like a coca cola can.
7629 2018-03-08 04:56:57 So thoughtful that he waits to unroll this the year he's up for re-election. Who knew oil prices and production were on the decline? Oh yeah, that was all of us for a few years now.

7632 2018-03-08 04:56:09 Man I got a bunch of oil all over me :(
7633 2018-03-08 04:56:08 
7634 2018-03-08 04:55:54 Caster oil, work your magic on my hair please
7635 2018-03-08 04:55:54 honestly at this point I’m pretty sure my blood content is 20% olive oil
7636 2018-03-08 04:55:24 But, the steel industry is based in vote-rich Ontario.  Oil is AB, SK and NEBC.  Districts where PM Dressup has no chance of winning. 

If oil was in Ontario, there’d be pipelines spraying it all over the world.
7637 2018-03-08 04:54:34 The Kessel analogy is a good one and says a lot about both markets. The need for a scapegoat is always a necessity when things don't go well in Edmonton or Toronto.
7638 2018-03-08 04:54:08 Same thing, but use cherry tomatoes, and put a block of feta with some olive oil on it in the middle of a glass pie plate with the tomatoes all around. The feta sort of semi-melts and makes an amazing spread for bread or crackers. Try it tomorrow, then thank me publicly. ;-)
7639 2018-03-08 04:53:47 Agreed. The issue is the teams Dzone effort and play as a whole. This team could make a Vezina winner look like Racicot!

He also wanted to stop new CIA head daddy Bush n others from doing a FF attack on Cuba so they can get at their oil wells in cuba
7647 2018-03-08 04:53:27 That probably requires a fair amount of oil.

7662 2018-03-08 04:50:02 Tossed 2 flasks of oil into a safe with a goblin in it, waited for it to get big flames and the shut it on the Goblin. Sorry Clap Grumble tried to kill your goblin Monk Mr DM. He was bloodied in one hit and needed to sleep and also it was funny.

7671 2018-03-08 04:48:54 That’s the negligence I’m talking about. A drawer is unacceptable. My guns need padding... and humidity control, and frog oil.

7680 2018-03-08 04:47:22 I'd argue it was 50/50. Hall's attitude was shit before he was traded. You can't blame the guy either. It is what it is and PC didn't want to put up with it. He wanted Larsson to deal with the Pacific's giants.

Now, that's all I'll say on that. I know me and Rob disagree and so
7681 2018-03-08 04:47:00 Throw some hot oil on him, STANLEY
7682 2018-03-08 04:46:22  yes imagine if the oil in your car could not be changed. Or the brake pads. Ridiculous.
7683 2018-03-08 04:46:03 What if I said, when center gov gave us rights to govern oil and gas mining, is because the mine is already emptied.

7708 2018-03-08 04:43:02 Said it the moment the trade was confirmed. It had less to do w/ Hall & everything to do w/ Chiarelli wanting Larsson.
7709 2018-03-08 04:42:47 I guess if men don't pose like bodybuilders, and in one hand hold an AK47 and in the other hand an axe, whilst being covered in dirt, oil, blood and naked women, then it's effeminate.

•1 brush in the shower while conditioning
•certain shampoo & conditioner
•2 brushes & a comb after shower & while hair is still wet
•a mask+argon oil+lots of mousse 
•3 hour dry time- bc it can’t blow dry

7734 2018-03-08 04:37:50 You know coal, oil and gas are just old solar batteries. No need for them. Save on extraction, processing, transmission and transport. Say goodbye to the steam age.
7735 2018-03-08 04:37:22 CBD oil has been studied to be an alternative and great benefit for many health conditions- seizures, migraines, pain, insomnia. It's not a "miracle" but I want to say that it's still a good treatment alternative. And the CBD oil your cousin is referencing isn't >>
7736 2018-03-08 04:37:20 Congress pass a veto proof bill. Look it up. Some of it has to do with Russian oligarchs and visa and the oil and gas industry. But the King is resisting the will of the people. He thinks he can ignore Congress and has that BECAUSE ITS PUTIN.

7740 2018-03-08 04:36:36 Yes. Actually the recipe is 1 cup self-rising flour, 1 cup self-rising corneal, 2 eggs, 1 Tbsp sugar, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1/3 cup water, 1/4 cup veg oil, 1 cup grated cheddar, and 1/4 diced pickled jalapenos.
7741 2018-03-08 04:36:35 I realized I had a problem while doing a coconut oil hair treatment tonight, when all I could think about was how I smelt like a Samoa girlscout cookie.

7745 2018-03-08 04:36:18 Okay everyone I need some good hair care products/tips. Pls don’t recommend coconut oil, bc it does nothing for my hair and it turns it mad rough and frizzy. Tysm.
7746 2018-03-08 04:36:04 I need to get my oil changed by Friday but I don’t feel like waiting 
7747 2018-03-08 04:35:52 Don't really care, as re-signing him after his current deal expires was never part of the plan and still isn't.
7748 2018-03-08 04:35:50 No I bought this other stuff it’s like oil. I should try that though, I heard it works really good! 
7749 2018-03-08 04:35:43 Yeah was thinking it would be closer to $500 avg price, so something like -$60/t from Goondi would still end up at $460 + Oil

7755 2018-03-08 04:35:01 China has been allowed to come here and buy companies such as husky oil etc. they come here and buy we dont buy there as much. We have given them way too much of our technology.
7756 2018-03-08 04:34:46 Also need pipelines so we can move oil safely which frees up countless trains for grain
7757 2018-03-08 04:34:45 And it broke?  Oil based?  Weird.

7798 2018-03-08 04:26:31 Microgrid is another offender - people assume it means clean. The oil & gas, mining and other industries have had microgrids (some not so micro) all around the world for decades...none of them clean.

7810 2018-03-08 04:24:18 It's not about oil n your economy, it's about saving what's best about Canada. You said it. The coast, the wildlife. Go ahead, destroy it all to make a buck like the US does, the US your thick headed Canadians are so envious of. Open their eyes. They don't see what CANADA IS!
7811 2018-03-08 04:24:06 I soaked that paper in oil, fucking wrecked! But let's roll another one just to be sure.
7812 2018-03-08 04:23:51 I do love how many are running w/ the Taylor Hall needed a change of scenery to become the player he's been this season in New Jersey angle. Yet, he essentially did same thing throughout much of his Oilers career. Paying attention helps.
7813 2018-03-08 04:23:24 An old boss had a fav: "listening to that person felt like eating an overripe banana dipped in castor oil!"

When enunciated slowly in Tamil that always elicited roars of laughter
7814 2018-03-08 04:23:15 and this was on a back to back. ;)

7819 2018-03-08 04:22:33 How to dish:

• chop garlic as finely as you can without fucking murdering yourself

• get other ingredients ready separately

• cook sausage in pot (olive oil somewhat heated, but it'll scorch the pot anyway, oh well deal with it)

• throw in chopped garlic, let it cook some

7821 2018-03-08 04:22:02 .@WKYT Trump and the GOP have slashed the National Parks budget by billions. Their goal is to sell them off to oil, mineral interests. Stop ignoring how this administration is destroying our lands and resources.
7822 2018-03-08 04:21:50 The petro is the first cryptocurrency regulated by the state while other cryptocurrencies operate outside the global financial system and Central Banks. Moreover, mineral resources such as reserves of Venezuelan wealth like oil, gold, gas, and diamond will back the petro.
7823 2018-03-08 04:21:44 I'm not into twinks, but the appeal as I understand it isn't in any sort of weakness or beta-ness, it's in their youth and, consequently, their perceived innocence. Plus they're typically thin, which these guys aren't, and have attractive faces, which these guys don't.

7828 2018-03-08 04:20:55 I know, I’m probably naive but had  just read that oil pulling with coconut oil could fix the issue but I’m thinking that’s bunk. Am gonna try to get in on Friday.
7829 2018-03-08 04:20:41 He is the handsome one.  Plus, in Texas, the land commissioner is key power position. Oil is key- oil royalties to the state for land owned by it. One of the reasons we don’t have income tax.

7852 2018-03-08 04:16:59 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Russia allowed oil drilling in a beautiful uninsured American.
7853 2018-03-08 04:16:58 hey twitter - here goes my first cbd oil experience. 8666666666 SOS BYEEEEEEEEE
7854 2018-03-08 04:16:54 nope.. it was a flawed process @JustinTrudeau said it himself incomplete in regards to consulting coastal FN and in the end a blatant trade off to Alberta for adopting a carbon tax that the government could impose regardless. bending over for big oil and china. #ShowustheScience
7855 2018-03-08 04:16:51 Clog those streams, smudge that air, and oil those oceans. Damn it all for the money grubbers.
7856 2018-03-08 04:16:45 Nvm, I’m burning the midnight oil 
7857 2018-03-08 04:16:44 I said it before. I'll say it again. #Russia, the #EU, and the #USA should all cooperate with one another for mutual happiness, pleasure, etc. Think about increased access to resources and access to coastline you didn't have before. Also no more oil trade dependent economies.
7858 2018-03-08 04:16:29 Ditto. But I guess with prosecution you need to keep digging even after you strike oil. Fingers crossed.
7859 2018-03-08 04:16:18 Bearish Catalyst 8/3/2018

1) Prospects of cancelled shipment to India
2) Traders squared positions as a safety measure ahead of USDA
3) Higher crude oil due to higher inventories and output  data
4) Fear of trade war against graIns in U.S

7865 2018-03-08 04:15:41 the remarkable aspects are that Petro is the first cryptocurrency distributed and regulated by the state, as well as it is supported by Venezuelan mineral resources like the oil, which they have the largest reserves, and as a result, the price will not fluctuate on the economy.

7892 2018-03-08 04:10:51 Wait a minute. With USA border stations selling at about C$0.70 a litre and our gas taxes about $.10 a litre more than WA, it is not taxes that are making the huge difference in what we pay at the pump. It is the oil companies. #bcpoli #vanpoli
7893 2018-03-08 04:10:50 Interesting that the Raptors changed their style of play with the same coach and no real major overhaul of their roster. They're practically 10 deep and consequently guys like DeRozan and Lowry look.fresh this late in the season.

7931 2018-03-08 04:03:55 Most commodities don't have the range of variation that oil has seen over past 5 years. Most commodities won't see global change based on one ruling family in Saudi Arabia.

7932 2018-03-08 04:03:49 Sprinkle some baking soda over it to soak up the oil then vacuum it up! I do that because it happens to me all the time
7933 2018-03-08 04:03:47 The moment the producers find all them clips of you online talking about "oil up and hit the gym with me" youre gonna get banned from the auditions. Besides, after doing such amazing work on the Tetris doc, how could you run off to do something non-game related?
7934 2018-03-08 04:03:44 There is only prob, you have a judiciary responsibility to those who pay you, that’s how the law works. However this is not up with the times, this case is complicated but I still think winnable...just my opinion though. That net neutrality had something to do with this...

7941 2018-03-08 04:02:13 What I do is flatten it, mix up a blend of whatever spices/seasonings you want in a bowl, then place the chicken in it so it covers both sides.

7947 2018-03-08 04:01:41 sorry, I don't promote dictators or oil.

oil is on it's way out

you'll have to find other things to be "Gay" friendly about
7948 2018-03-08 04:01:33 The salads have more calories because of all the oil and such supposedly.
7949 2018-03-08 04:01:31 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
7950 2018-03-08 04:01:16 If you don’t own coconut oil what r u doing
7951 2018-03-08 04:01:08 Think of commodity price movements (e.g. that of oil, gold, silver) as just one factor that may affect or correlate with the commodity currencies like AUD, NZD, and CAD.
7952 2018-03-08 04:00:40 U.S. oil production is
storming ahead and the world’s largest economy is now set to also become the world’s
largest oil producer!
7953 2018-03-08 04:00:38 I love love love my oil diffuser!!
7954 2018-03-08 04:00:37 OIL DIFF: 3.31 -> 3.32
7955 2018-03-08 04:00:32 プリズムストーン行きたいなー
7956 2018-03-08 04:00:26 That's fine and dandy... but Canada shud try and model after other advanced nations, using alternate sources of energy(wind, solar)-instead of destroying our land with extracting unclean oil.
7957 2018-03-08 04:00:26 I agree and I just looked them up, I don’t think they are privately owned...
7958 2018-03-08 04:00:18 Yes lets keep selling our oil cheap to Americans so they can export for a huge profit. At least that will fund American schools and hospitals.
7959 2018-03-08 04:00:16 oil on canvas. artist: God themself
7960 2018-03-08 04:00:09 Add oil brother 
7961 2018-03-08 04:00:07 ابشري
7962 2018-03-08 03:59:54 Risky move. Best to distract with a nice lather, of massage oil of course (anything else would be silly). This satisfies her without subjecting oneself to commitment one is not yet ready to verbally agree to
7963 2018-03-08 03:59:29 Not take legal bribes from NRA, Wall Street, Big Pharma, Oil Industry, or ISP’s
7964 2018-03-08 03:59:11 Actually, the correct term is bitumen sands. However, oil is extracted from bitumen, tar is a product of oil, so oil sands is more accurate than tar sands.
7965 2018-03-08 03:59:03 حسبي الله عليك عرض السموات والأرض ايش تبغى فينا وفي حكامنا يانكره تحط راسك براس دوله وأقوى دوله وترى أن دعيت أو سبيت ماظلمت الا نفسك. نحن مبسوطين ونحب ملكنا وولد سلمان ونفداه بارواحنا الوطن غالي يافاسد ويافاقد العقل والدين الحنيف
7966 2018-03-08 03:58:58 Why hasn’t anyone told me about rosehip oil for my face?! I’m in loveee
7967 2018-03-08 03:58:31 Oil demand is increasing every year. You seem fine promoting dictator oil. Your choice. I prefer Canada’s Gay friendly Oil. @uvicpride
7968 2018-03-08 03:58:17 I'll oil my chest up if you send me $30
7969 2018-03-08 03:58:07 I appreciate the idea but the proposed land that’ll be shut off to industry contains Billions$ in natural resources like oil + gas, timber, and farm land. Hunting fishing trapping will be null, which was 1of biggest tourist draws in the area Tough to replace with caribou tourists
7970 2018-03-08 03:58:05 No. Not the snake oil salesmen. FFS. So? If any 10 year old can fact check anything does that make you, 8?
7971 2018-03-08 03:58:03 اشوى
7972 2018-03-08 03:57:57 im stressed and so i was putting lavender oil in my diffuser bc lavender calms me down but i spilt the bottle on my carpet 
7973 2018-03-08 03:57:54 face mask, hot oil treatment in my hair, detox tea. i fake love myself tonight.
7974 2018-03-08 03:57:16 Mike. Stop. You seem to be fine buying Gay killing dictator oil. And Vivian Krause is Canada’s greatest investigative journalist!!
7975 2018-03-08 03:57:08 Camarada las tapas de alcantarillas y tanquillas de sericios, requieren una atención especial. Las aceras son usadas de estacionamiento, van destruyendo las tapas de estas tanquillas, ocasionan múltiples molestias y lesiones a los peatones.
7976 2018-03-08 03:57:00 My oil diffuser is my favorite thing. Get you the good sleep blend oil knocks out you out in an hourrrr

7980 2018-03-08 03:56:40 essential oil ni guna dia macam mana eh?
7981 2018-03-08 03:56:26 Murpheys oil soap is often used to wash elephants.
7982 2018-03-08 03:56:16 The best food for the soul is to wash your napkins with fish oil

7986 2018-03-08 03:55:42 The very phone in his hand smh needs oil
7987 2018-03-08 03:55:36 the more i hear about things like this the more i think that we are reliving the dinosaur period with degradable plastics into oil and i am actually the key to unlocking a future. ????

7989 2018-03-08 03:55:03 John Linder one of the Lane gang was the one who joined the Marines when he was told Viet Nam war was all about oil "I'll fight to keep my car on the road ' Before that he wouldn't go 

Cobalt blue water fleet ?  Caribbean blue ?
7990 2018-03-08 03:54:31 Mike, You make your choice. My family prefers buying Gay friendly oil. Sad, that you prefer the Gay killing type. @uvicpride
7991 2018-03-08 03:54:27 And it’s got a big oil cooler I guess, and oil lines, and the filter holds like half a quart so idk maybe it’s not as crazy as I thought.
7992 2018-03-08 03:54:26 It ain't only about what the world needs - Australia may export gas, but imports oil, petrol, AvGas and diesel.
7993 2018-03-08 03:54:25 #TSDPaghaharap Mayumi and Isabelat are like oil and water. Isabelle’s late mom had so much influence on her. She’s been a nightmare to Isabelle. @mikaeldaez @meganbata @katrina_halili

7995 2018-03-08 03:54:15 Mad  respect to all oil painters
7996 2018-03-08 03:54:03 ถ้ามันเลยจุดคำว่าคิดถึงมากๆๆไปได้แล้ว มันจะกลายเป็นไม่คิดถึง ได้ไหม
7997 2018-03-08 03:54:00 ★★★★★ Bought the Lavender Essential Oil (40/42), check out my review!
7998 2018-03-08 03:53:55 I don’t find them jobs to be honeydos they are just fun to do like changing oil in the vehicles and polishing my alloys and such it’s also very relaxing.
7999 2018-03-08 03:53:51 Who folded? You fuck-ups were in power for nine years.
Your big plan was just to sell the wheat board so the trains could be available for oil
8000 2018-03-08 03:53:47 Dear Tom Cruise, there are a lot of things going on in UAE and there is a bright outlook for UAE growing due to recent oil price recovery, international trade assists a driver for its growth. Human animal rights are big topics there as well if you inscribe them in your theme. wow
8001 2018-03-08 03:53:42 They won’t.  Your skin isn’t even bad. And it’s dry, not oily. Accutane just dries up all of your oil. 

(And causes digestive problems, depression, anxiety, birth defects, other skin problems) 

Not worth it unless your acne is out of control. And yours isn’t. 
8002 2018-03-08 03:53:24 What a bunch of fake propaganda!  No facts, you oil boys will say anything.
8003 2018-03-08 03:53:07 When people say "CBD doesn't work" Check the source/ingredients. Not all CBD IS CREATED EQUAL. Fact: CBD DOES WORK, dont be fooled. Hemp oil companies lack credibility when they say their CBD comes from hemp seed and stalk." Seeds do NOT have CBD, a bare minimal from stalk/stem.

8005 2018-03-08 03:52:50 Not at all. I understand oil demand increases every year. Canada’s Gay friendly and environmentaly friendly should be purchased instead of Gay killing dictator oil. Simple. Why do you prefer buying dictator oil? @vancouverpride
8006 2018-03-08 03:52:33 I’m guessing my aftermarket case holds more than the stock cases did. I thought I had a 1.5 quart extra sump but maybe it’s a two quart sump and 4 quart case  idk it’s got 6 quarts of oil in it 
8007 2018-03-08 03:52:28 So, should I drop anything else *crazy* re: #KremlinGate?

In case the #cryptocurrency+ global map of crime/subversion, the cascading #FARA option, Russian intel leaders teaching CI from Federal supermax, biodigesters wiping out oil & China's supply-chain issues weren't enough?
8008 2018-03-08 03:52:21 ほんとキジネコ飼いが多いですw

8009 2018-03-08 03:52:03 A week, oops after a couple months time for an oil change, you do it yourself still costs ya $20 bucks, a couple weeks later head gasket blows, $800 dollar fix, which is more than the car is worth, uh oh you already spent all your savings,  well you’ll just have to walk to work

8013 2018-03-08 03:51:45 Crude oil inventories could fall coming weeks, as recent colder weather rips the northeast in March,,instead of warmer weather, late winter blast. More colder weather expected next week. February warmest month and march could be coldest month, than expected.
8014 2018-03-08 03:51:35 If anyone out there is wanting to get my attention... lavender oil. That’s it. I love lavender oil! So good for my soul and of course skin
8015 2018-03-08 03:51:28 Fun fact: I'm not a fan of truffle oil.
8016 2018-03-08 03:51:01 Wow. But with all things trump, it's not very helpful to try to use logic or reason with him or his followers. It's like trying to figure out if his 90% snake oil tonic is a better product than his 50% snake oil and 50% armadillo extract.
8017 2018-03-08 03:50:56 One wonders the percentage of men as nurses, primary school teachers and day care staff.
And the percentage of women as miners, oil rig workers, front-line soldiers, etc.
Gender inequality can exist through individuals' choices.

8018 2018-03-08 03:50:45 I havent tried their moisturizer but I mix a drop or two of the rosehip oil in my mario badescu aha+ceramide moisturizer.
8019 2018-03-08 03:50:43 China bringing their Oil settled in juan, exchanged for gold, should speed up the $$ demise...less than a month to go.
8020 2018-03-08 03:50:38 My job involves food packaging and people ask this about rice and oil

8028 2018-03-08 03:49:38 It's going to take so much more, Barack, it means standing up to the NRA, that freakish gun club which has become a lobby even more powerful than oil. You had 8 years to slap them down, but didn't.
8029 2018-03-08 03:49:35 Is there any way you could possibly help me out! We are trying to run the Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Series? Plus in August we have the #OurDirtMillion please DM me and let me know?
8030 2018-03-08 03:49:31 YES WHY REX? WHY? OIL INTEREST PERHAPS???
8031 2018-03-08 03:49:22 (Devos bro) is the most euphamistic description of this villain imaginable.

He's a
- Mercenary industrialist
- War Criminal
- Domestic terrorist of native water protectors in collaboration with corrupt oil men and law ebforcement at Standing Rock

Give him a just description!
8032 2018-03-08 03:49:21 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
8033 2018-03-08 03:49:17 Need a oil change asap
8034 2018-03-08 03:49:15 Too bad oil is last century and that's not the future. Perhaps you should have read something about fuel and energy
8035 2018-03-08 03:49:02 Jaguar must have worked for years to get their EV to leak oil.
8036 2018-03-08 03:48:34 No I havent but like a month or two ago I started using their stuff and I LOVE IT. I use their niacinimide+zinc when I have acne, rosehip oil when my skin is dry, I mix that with the hylaronic acid if my skin is REALLY dry, caffeine solution for under eye
8037 2018-03-08 03:48:32 True, you’d jump through the roof of Lucas Oil if given the chance
8038 2018-03-08 03:48:18 And DeRozan continues to do it all...takes on 4 Pistons and finds the open man with the game on the line. These Raptors are a different team...the playoffs will be fun.
8039 2018-03-08 03:48:14 You might need to go to the dermatologist
In the mean time try to put a carrier oil on your face
Grapeseed oil is great for calming down inflammation (it's also my holy grail and love of my life)
8040 2018-03-08 03:48:12 oh you lit your mommas house on fire? Wanna know what I was 13 years old? I would inflate an inflatable pool and fill it up with Sherm and oil myself butt naked. WELCOME TO MY LIFE.
8041 2018-03-08 03:47:59 Eberle for Strome would still be available this summer. Oil got rid of Eberle a year early for no reason whatsoever.
8042 2018-03-08 03:47:57 I shaved with baby oil and exfoliated and I feel like a Star
8043 2018-03-08 03:47:46 Decadence No. 4.
When did Russian crude oil output reach its 1989 level (which was lower than 1985 level).
In 2015.

8052 2018-03-08 03:45:42 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

8055 2018-03-08 03:45:33 Totally crazy. Haven't folks seen what's going on in Venezuela, largest oil reserves on earth? The history of the USSR? Seen the abject failure of such economies globally? Inane that it's being presented as optimal economic/social policy in colleges these days in the West. Wth..
8056 2018-03-08 03:45:09 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
8057 2018-03-08 03:45:04 I see a lot of cleansers get bad reviews for not being able to take off a pound of makeup. Oil that ish off before you use the cleanser, peach.

8073 2018-03-08 03:42:47 but they’re naturally so thin so i’m trying to grow them with castor oil so they get thicker or at least more dense but that shit is taking forever
8074 2018-03-08 03:42:43 How many KGs of Oil are we going to consume? That part of the market is going to be huge growth. Maybe CDN's will only smoke 800K but I bet we can ingest another 800K. The CBD is going to be a monster.

8077 2018-03-08 03:42:20 Went out playing games with friends and had a lovely time. We played Snake Oil (one of our favourite party games) and my stomach hurts from laughing. Good evening. <3

8080 2018-03-08 03:42:07 jan-feb surplus is ~ 50b this year v ~ $40b last year, so i basically agree.  but Chinese export growth has been strong for real (setting aside seasonal complexity).  china clearly paying more for oil yet no obvious fall in y/y surplus
8081 2018-03-08 03:42:06 Tell your mother that I have tried casting lavender oil on @tedcruz but it is not effective.

8092 2018-03-08 03:40:52 Last time i checked antibiotics saved over 200 million lives last year. How much did essential oil save?
8093 2018-03-08 03:40:39 I’ve been using oil pulling but I don’t see any miracle other than a bit of whitening.

8096 2018-03-08 03:40:18 How that horse guy keeps his backhair from matting up with the oil is beyond me. I can barely manage the argyle chest hair.
8097 2018-03-08 03:40:17 Soon... Renewable-Sustainable energy will overtake oil/coal energy, as well as "War of Current", when Tesla's AC overtook Edison's DC.

8099 2018-03-08 03:40:14 I hope they prove the oil company was not in compliance with OSHA regulations and sue them into bankruptcy.

8101 2018-03-08 03:39:54 Profit motive:  
Hundreds of billion$$$ in undeveloped Russian oil and gas shale plays and petroleum deposit fields stood to make all these players wealthy beyond measure.
8102 2018-03-08 03:39:30 Oil on panel :)
8103 2018-03-08 03:39:28 How is asparagus so good?  All crispy tips all Himalayan pink and that fresh cracked pepper all tossed in oil all getting real crunchy  for you just thanks guys
8104 2018-03-08 03:39:17 A nice hot shower and then some Rosemary mint oil after....man LISTEN, makes me feel at peace !
8105 2018-03-08 03:39:16 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
8106 2018-03-08 03:39:10 I got mine at the one in Dover. They had really good deals at the time i went. Its a little bit further away but they threw in like free tire rotations and some oil changes with it. They were really nice and helpful

8108 2018-03-08 03:38:56 I don't understand.... How do you paint with oil?
8109 2018-03-08 03:38:49 I'm gonna start using oil paints soon and I'm so excited
8110 2018-03-08 03:38:48 had a clear plastic bottle of water next to a clear plastic bottle of baby oil and went to grab a drink out of my peripheral vision - things almost went very badly very quickly
8111 2018-03-08 03:38:45 Doubt you could find a real oil subsidy.  Petroleum is the most taxed industry when you count production taxes & gas taxes.  Number one source of US govt nontax revenue is Gulf of Mexico fees.
8112 2018-03-08 03:38:26 I'm so curious about why the melting point of the coconut oil changed on the TPE toys! Do you think it has to do with the mineral oil being a plasticizer?
8113 2018-03-08 03:38:12 I personally use 10-20 drops of a high grade Ylang Ylang into a carrier oil of my choice. Argan, Jojoba, etc. 
8114 2018-03-08 03:38:07 They were looking for a map with giant cartoon oil wells all over it. Kind of like finding a bag with a giant dollar sign on it. #TCMParty

8123 2018-03-08 03:36:46 I just used coconut oil on my legs after shaving for the first time and i feel like a GODDESS
8124 2018-03-08 03:36:31 Y’all should keep that same $19.99 energy with synthetic oil. For the one time one one time.
8125 2018-03-08 03:36:12 Let’s not blame the oil and gas companies at all for that.
8126 2018-03-08 03:36:10 ADD OIL BRI!!!!
8127 2018-03-08 03:35:55 It was needlessly taxed away by the Alberta PC's pissing away oil revenue, but you go right ahead and mistake me for being a tree hugger, if that's your gig.
8128 2018-03-08 03:35:52 I put undiluted peppermint oil on my skin because I only have one functional brain cell
8129 2018-03-08 03:35:38 We've been talking about oil money ever since it started making y'all "dominate"
8130 2018-03-08 03:35:02 Legalization of hemp is a key piece of my agenda. This small change, would recreate jobs that have been shipped overseas, like the Carolina textile industry, & New England paper mills. Seeds could be fed to chickens & cattle, making healthier meat & eggs, & oil for fuel #Adam2020
8131 2018-03-08 03:34:29 Simply blaming the Oil companies will not help !!!
8132 2018-03-08 03:34:13 Wasn't Mohamed El-Erian the guy who were calling for $200 oil when it when to the bottom pit?
8133 2018-03-08 03:34:01 I guess it wasn’t just the rusty bolts that needed oil...
8134 2018-03-08 03:33:56 Can we build a new highway east?

Tube shaped?

To carry little cars made completely out of oil?
8135 2018-03-08 03:33:39 Beard oil is good stuff
8136 2018-03-08 03:33:38 Grilled portobello mushrooms! Marinate them for like half an hour in olive oil, vinegar, and whatever spices you want. Add crumbled cheese and it’s amazing!
8137 2018-03-08 03:33:27 These ones are sushi rice, red pepper, carrot, avo, cucumber, green onion, sesame seeds, shrimp, sesame oil and spicy mayo (vegan mayo mixed with siraracha).
8138 2018-03-08 03:33:21 You can fix a messy watercolor with the right filter and a tissue... [dead inside but enthusiastic voice] BUT THAT OIL PAINTING IS FOREVER AND FIXING REQUIRES OVERLAPPING MORE PAINT!
8139 2018-03-08 03:33:15 This Trump, Tilleron Rusaia & UEA tghis is all abnout making money & controling OIL.
8140 2018-03-08 03:33:04 Autumn advances. Branches that once were lush now are bare and dry, ready to feed flames. The season for buying oil is now almost past.
8141 2018-03-08 03:32:55 Well, they use the same oil that was used with the chicken. They don’t change the oil out.
8142 2018-03-08 03:32:55 Haitian black castor oil is underrated asf it stank tho
8143 2018-03-08 03:32:48 So I hate thee process of putting coconut oil in your hair, & washing it out. But after you wash it out and your hair dries, your hair is so soft & feels amazing. Can’t complain! Lol
8144 2018-03-08 03:32:48 I guess the problem with Trump is that he isn't giving blow jobs to Vicente Fox or allowing thousands of America's youth to be killed for the oil wells in Afghanistan - so that he can be a millionaire ten times over, huh?

8147 2018-03-08 03:32:12 Respectfully Robert, I have kids younger than you so I am concerned beyond “your” generation. I want a 100% renewable future as quickly as you do but know it will take a couple of decades for us to get there. As we strive to get there replace oil w/ nat gas.
8148 2018-03-08 03:32:05 update on my hair journey: SO i went my to hairdresser and she informed me that i apparently developed ECZEMA ON MY SCALP, but she said to use shampoo with tea tree oil in it and it’s working so far so

8150 2018-03-08 03:31:46 I’m a big fan of a team dropping 263 million of Qatari oil money on 1 player only to have that player go out with injury right before the crucial match against Madrid in the tournament you bought him to help win. That’s why I wear the Neymar PSG jersey!
8151 2018-03-08 03:31:42 it's not dude
think about it if you put water on water you just get more water 
water itself isn't inherently wet, but it can be wet. If you put, say, oil or gasoline on the water, then the water would be wet with oil/gasoline
8152 2018-03-08 03:31:36 In the span of a week I have some how misplaced my coconut oil, my prestos, a purse, and my medicine. Idk what I’m doing

8172 2018-03-08 03:28:30 It isn't fair to compare Shake Shack to the others tbh. They are much more expensive and use much better ingredients for the burger. It isn't really the same thing as the others. 

At Smash, I get the mushroom and swiss with truffle oil mayo. It's sublime.

8179 2018-03-08 03:28:02 The Seven Pillars of Wisdom is still a must-read . Lawerence made some assertions that time has proved right. There are others of the period who believed in Empire, but were realists about self-determination. If we didn't need oil in WW1 and 2, Saudi would still be a tented city

8185 2018-03-08 03:27:15 It’s true that Russia makes anti-fracking propaganda though, which only makes sense considering they would prefer we didn’t have so much of our own oil and gas. Fracking is still bad though.

8195 2018-03-08 03:25:29 I let some oil and a little butter get hot in the pan. Dry the scallops completely, salt and pepper, put the scallops in the pan and don’t move them for 2 min, flip and cook 2 more min. Done. Put on cooked orzo & dinner is ready. 15 min tops
8196 2018-03-08 03:25:26 I am in BC the my house is powered by hydro. And all of this oil is being exported off of the west coast. Not doing anything for Canadas own energy production or for canadians use. He is a moron

8219 2018-03-08 03:22:13 It's very sensible to measure how effective a cancer treatment is.  Grifters and faith healers object to measuring effectiveness because it usually shows their favorite remedy is ineffective.

8240 2018-03-08 03:19:14 I’m using Aiken. Just any 100% tea tree oil I could find. Then dilute it with a little bit of toner before applying.
8241 2018-03-08 03:19:11 Who else will be at the #NoDrilling demonstration in #HuntingtonBeach tomorrow at the pier? I am looking forward to demanding @DanaRohrabacher stand with his district and not his corporate big oil donors. Together, we will hold him accountable!

8246 2018-03-08 03:18:40 tea tree oil fixes everything. get u some!
8247 2018-03-08 03:18:39 Yeah, all those Greens dragged before ICAC and going to work for oil and gas companies when they retire.  Oh wait, that is the full of integrity corporate shill parties.
8248 2018-03-08 03:18:34 @Morning_Joe So, let me get this straight. Putin told Trump who he wanted for Secretary of State! I wonder why he wanted Rex? Maybe Oil! Our President is taking orders from Vladimir Putin! Everyone must learn to play chess!
8249 2018-03-08 03:18:20 @POTUS time to levy import duties on foreign oil into US.  We have more than abundant supply. #OOTT #WTI #Brent

8251 2018-03-08 03:17:59 I’ve actually got a beautiful essential oil balm from a Canadian company that is great for that! Sadly it’s not restoring my voice (but I can breathe!)
8252 2018-03-08 03:17:46 @VinnieTortorich  would popcorn with coconut oil and salt kick me out of ketosis? Haven’t had popcorn in over a year...kinda miss it#dumbquestion?
8253 2018-03-08 03:17:41 That’s a cigar box.  Mine is an oil can.
8254 2018-03-08 03:17:02 Turkey created ISIS to kill Kurds and export stolen Syrian oil to Turkey.

8256 2018-03-08 03:16:59 I finish prompt, won't happen sooner, to me, though, in the names of laughing as oil and go and no names.

8261 2018-03-08 03:16:28 Guy I went to high school with: FF7 is an allegory for real life reliance on oil we're killing the planet burning so much.

FF7 lore: "So we can use this oil stuff instead of mako and it won't kill the Planet? *&@$!"
8262 2018-03-08 03:16:25 Prime example of what drinking "Idiot Oil" does to the brain.

8273 2018-03-08 03:14:43 I want a hot bath with candles and body oil 
8274 2018-03-08 03:14:28 I think she’ll stick to the oil pastels 
8275 2018-03-08 03:14:05 OMG THAT'S TERRIFYING. Before oils were a mlm thing, I had a witchy/herbal teas/make yr own cosmetics phase. EVERYTHING I read said to never ingest or apply an oil undiluted to your skin, and as far as I can tell, the MLMs suggest this all the time.
8276 2018-03-08 03:13:57 these fries taste like chewy oil
8277 2018-03-08 03:13:43 Why is anyone surprised? DPA and a lawsuit in Italy! Its clear that giant oil companies have a false-screen Compliance program to cover the actual deals that make them big.
8278 2018-03-08 03:13:35 Just keep it clean & dry most of the time. Some people add ointment occasionally like Vitamin E oil, Bag Balm, or Neosporin.
8279 2018-03-08 03:13:29 Olive oil, diced garlic, red pepper, oregano, diced yellow onion. Cook to aroma. Add can of San Marzano tomato and basil. Slow boil for at least an hour. Thicken with 2tps of butter. Season to finish. #perfectredsauce
8280 2018-03-08 03:13:01 Just zipped through the game. Gutted. 2nd goal terrible. Davies doesn't keep the line. And then the goal line header late by Kane (though he was offside). And Juve definitely deserved a pena in the 1st half. Young team lost to a filthy group of pros. Deja Vu (Oil/Ducks last yr)
8281 2018-03-08 03:12:49 And allowing offshore oil drilling off the coast of Long Island really takes the cake.
8282 2018-03-08 03:12:46 Petro differs from other cryptocurrencies because it is backed by mineral resources such as: oil, gold, diamonds and gas. In addition, it is the first cryptocurrency regulated by a State and its price will not fluctuate, it will vary according to the Venezuelan crude oil basket.

8286 2018-03-08 03:11:51 Has anyone ever considered other means to protect our schools? Dedicated service animals would protect our schools better than anything. Imagine a trained school dog as a mascot that can smell gunpowder or gun oil and protect our children as well as show them affection.
8287 2018-03-08 03:11:28 MOISTURE. IS. IMPORTANT. 
if you don’t moisturize, you’re body thinks you need oil/more moisture which causes an oily face
8288 2018-03-08 03:11:24 Snake oil salesmen count on it. He’s definitely one.
8289 2018-03-08 03:11:20 It's a crime to fry steak in olive oil
8290 2018-03-08 03:11:07 Not pure castor oil. Probably only has one drop of castor oil in it. Castor oil should be the only ingredient
8291 2018-03-08 03:10:34 Lip liner. Eye liner is a given just to create some drama but not always needed. For you I’d do a beard oil and slight trim, bold lip with a subtle liner blended, contours and a simple thin eye

8294 2018-03-08 03:10:08 Me too. Essential oil MLMs are the worst of all IMO. They encourage dangerous topical and internal use of EOs (even for infants, kids and pets) plus diffusing them into the air. Too many people think EOs are natural and not harmful but they're wrong.
8295 2018-03-08 03:09:59 me hablas de los 90 com el calo? 3 mangos el kilo de asado? 10 centavos el kgr de papas.....17 centavos el.litro de gas oil.. o de cuando me hablas?

8300 2018-03-08 03:09:14 Don't forget oil! Also we can create our own little stars on Earth - thermo-nuclear reactors!
8301 2018-03-08 03:09:09 Morton is not a registered biologist. She is not even a biologist. Well paid by American ENGO's to slag salmon farming. Funny for an environmentalist so alledgedly protective of salmon and whales she says nothing about oil pipelines or oil tankers. Because of Pew or Uncle Louis ?

8305 2018-03-08 03:08:32 I’ve burned oil before, didn’t even get anything in the pan before my kitchen was full of smoke. You’re not alone in your suffering.

8310 2018-03-08 03:07:30 Essential oil promoter: we have oils for when you’re tired, stressed, have a headache, can’t sleep, are emotional, have a stomach ache, and if you have breakouts!
Me: yes but what if I need to use those all at once?

8315 2018-03-08 03:07:01 How does my sandrail hold more oil than my truck...
8316 2018-03-08 03:06:59 i hate using olive oil on my hair but my hair loves it 
8317 2018-03-08 03:06:45 So it should be 150 cups of olive oil?
8318 2018-03-08 03:06:13 It's not $KGKG being referenced in that article.  It's close , but they aren't into the CBD oil and we are not down that 200% from it's high two weeks ago.  Anyhow , tomorrow will be interesting now lol
8319 2018-03-08 03:05:59 A war can be economic you dolt. You don't think sanctions are act of war? You don't think the United States cutting off oil to Japan in WWII was an act of war?

8323 2018-03-08 03:05:32 Audit all the Emoluments Trump receives from businesses he has not divested on. Golf trips, amounting to nearly 5 MONTHS since he’s been in office. The interior dept giving our land to oil and gas companies. You call yourself a fiscal conservative? #KLEPTOCRAT
8324 2018-03-08 03:05:21 I don't think the promotion required @Hinchtown to play center, that may have been the problem for the @Pacers
8325 2018-03-08 03:05:05 well, for you, yes. for me, it was pretty relaxing. note to self: don’t get an oil change when there is a nor’easter

8330 2018-03-08 03:04:34 I was shunned from the age of 4 till I was 6 years old for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
8331 2018-03-08 03:04:32 Honestly, probably a lot of oil drilling equipment

8336 2018-03-08 03:03:13  is it pure castor oil?
8337 2018-03-08 03:02:46 Get Shell out of Nigeria they have committed crimes of corruption not to mention the devastation caused to the farmers land oil spills everywhere not fixed. Nigerian officials have been corrupted for decades. Not much is being done with the huge wealth
8338 2018-03-08 03:02:28 Energy companies are assuming oil at $65 even tho there hasn't been a bullish catalyst other than hurricanes.  Bank underwriting should suffer as no need for trillions in corp. issuance. AUM should also suffer as markets soften. deposit slowdown.

8354 2018-03-08 03:00:23 So yesterday I bought an oil cleanser. Going full on with this whole double cleansing ish.
8355 2018-03-08 03:00:22 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
8356 2018-03-08 03:00:17 IIRC mainly. But there are a lot of impacts. For example, the BP oil spill alone killed 2-3 times as many birds as wind does annually
8357 2018-03-08 03:00:16 Use baking soda and coconut oil and mix it together and put it on your face for 10 mins then wash t off
8358 2018-03-08 03:00:10 i just started crying because my mom made me an essential oil mix she’s so sweet

8360 2018-03-08 03:00:03 How do we get all the corruption out of the govt? A Dem win in 2018 helps, but the Dark Money, GOP corruption, RU money ties, Big Oil, Citz United, Gerrymandering, it's all still in place. The Dems have had opportunities, & done at least not enuf.
8361 2018-03-08 02:59:48 Boscia Makeup Breakup Cleansing oil, Milk beauty primer stick, Urban Decay 24hr eyeliner, mini-Laura Mercier powder. You can guess how much that cost
8362 2018-03-08 02:59:41 Those Oil King three stars aren't gonna write themselves.
8363 2018-03-08 02:59:33 look at long term charts of apa, do, ns, wft, oas; basically these are uninvestable at the moment unless oil becomes $80-100 a barrel again
8364 2018-03-08 02:59:32 i always found the import of oil over using cdn so ironic/hypocritical.... support regimes that are anti-feminist and anti-LGBT all while claiming you are pro-both!
8365 2018-03-08 02:59:18 I love #AmericanHousewife more than Cooper B loves truffle oil
8366 2018-03-08 02:59:16 I’m a go pick up some oil
8367 2018-03-08 02:59:05 I saved my sister's infected toe, using tea tree oil.  Doctor said it worked better than the prescription.

If it starts to ooze or fester?  Try tea tree oil.  
8368 2018-03-08 02:58:58 What about non-literal oil?
8369 2018-03-08 02:58:57 I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow and I have my lavender essential oil in my diffuser. Good night
8370 2018-03-08 02:58:46 You mean, drill more oil and use the revenue to spend more on various govt programs? Sounds pretty neoliberal tbh.
8371 2018-03-08 02:58:43 Been fiddling with the D70 today and I am diggin' it. A LOT more than my Sony semi-SLR. Spring Break for me is next week. Thinking of doing the Indy canal walk and Lucas Oil Stadium Rd. 2 to get better shots, and the place is cool anyway, sooo!
8372 2018-03-08 02:58:41 Such a stupid headline. It was a fantastic movie and critical story in an amazing franchise. You won’t get Infinity War if you don’t see it.

8413 2018-03-08 02:52:25 Every Iranian is very well aware of it. Their first beloved elected leader, using the oil wealth for the people, & US & UK spy agencies organise a coup, & install a puppet ruler who hands the oil to the US, enriches his family, & runs a terrifying secret police/torture regime.
8414 2018-03-08 02:52:25 India looks terrible...agriculture responsible there...and yes...S.E.Asia sadly full of palm oil and rubber tree plantations...
8415 2018-03-08 02:52:14 This new way I found of brewing coffee with butter and coconut oil really makes @Pringles chips taste even better! I drank a cup and once I popped, I couldn’t stop until the can was empty.

8426 2018-03-08 02:50:33 The differences are: “Petro” is the first cryptocurrency launched by a government, it will be backed up by mineral resources (crude oil).

8433 2018-03-08 02:50:03 She already got it when y’all cheated and she shoulda put sugar where oil goes
8434 2018-03-08 02:49:58 I’m pretty good with the herbal cures. Manuka honey and colloidal silver, with oregano oil, mixed in hot tea with lemon, has cleared up any infections w/o antibiotics. And a LOT faster than meds!
8435 2018-03-08 02:49:44 shaving your legs with coconut oil is not a life hack. i repeat it’s not a hack.
8436 2018-03-08 02:49:41 I bought cbd oil for my anxiety today and it’s literally amazing. I haven’t felt this relaxed in years
8437 2018-03-08 02:49:30 Brother,  think freely. The foreign funded enviro radicals don’t care about . They only care about making US/Trump richer. This makes Canada poorer. And allows Gay killing dictators to sell their oil. Canada has gay friendly and environmentally friendly Oil. #LGBTQ

8440 2018-03-08 02:49:18 PS Warren Buffett, did @POTUS allowing building the Canadian oil pipeline (opposing Obama blockage) mean that you are no longer the ONLY person being paid to transport all oil from Canada (with your train lines)??
Was that why you were Obama's biggest contributor??
Or Visa versa!
8441 2018-03-08 02:49:15 I thought coconut oil was supposed to fix my problems but ITS NOT !

8445 2018-03-08 02:48:44 Everybody needs our oil. BC and the US have Canada cornered to sell to them. Tarrifs will be applied, taps turned back and no Canadian equalization payment. So now we have Trudeau, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and the US capitalizing at Canadian tax payers expense. Stupid Canadians!

8455 2018-03-08 02:46:56 We extract oil because it is is used in 95%  (rough guess) of the things we use everyday. Eliminate oil, you forage like a chinp  and you SJW’s cant even tweet about how bad it is.

8466 2018-03-08 02:45:51 All I keep hearing about is gas prices. "Gas prices going up! Prepare for higher gas prices! The price at the pump are going to get higher!" We get it. Oil companies like profit. Quit pretending it's anything other than that.

8538 2018-03-08 02:33:09 It's a tough choice. Does the world want to be dependent on oil from Saudi Arabia or Russia? Can we please speed up alternative energy sources before humanity self destructs?

They gave it the name of reducing INDIA's imports.  India is also deficit in OIL.  Why dont we STOP DRIVING and using OIL?  The Misfortune of HINDUISM is that these TRUTHS were long SUPPRESSED.

If an oil pipeline caused $100M in environmental damage, would #mndfl pursue criminal charges of negligence? Absolutely.

So... how much damage is MNLARS causing? $100M spent + $40M fix + $80M in future roadmap dev + $_B economic damage. Accountability? "No."

8594 2018-03-08 02:25:21 No. You’d need to hit it with enzymes to get a good yield and it’d still end cloudy from tahini and oil. The pick might be really good though.

8675 2018-03-08 02:12:24 you have not made any points. this has not been a conversation. all you have done is be a sad troll being sad and demonstrated a cultist like devotion to defending a delusional snake oil peddler that takes advantage of gullible young men.
8676 2018-03-08 02:12:24 As long as the children is not theirs And as long as there is no oil in Ghouta they will continue their act like; oh we do care but sry we can do nothing. I don’t know, does any one still believe in UN and the security council ?

Worth considering mentioned comment on Fukushima, an exmple of well engineered project & how failure can occur due to natural disaster causing massive harm!
I’ve heard no meaningful new safety designs for TMP.

8685 2018-03-08 02:11:22 Sadly, the trigger for the US enviro movement’s unholy fixation on our oil sands may’ve been the ‘06 AB Govt publicity stunt to park a giant yellow o.s. truck on Washington DC’s National Mall during a Smithsonian folklife festival. Nothing spontaneous about the opposition since.
8686 2018-03-08 02:11:19 I am covered in coconut oil from head to toe rn
8687 2018-03-08 02:11:11 Ancient wisdom: "Those who lie make sure their proof is far away". Who controls fake Muslim Farakhan to say Jews control the CIA w/o proof, and for how much oil $?
8688 2018-03-08 02:11:04 he have a vision of increasing the trading level and less dependency on oil
8689 2018-03-08 02:11:03 Tell that to the warmongers who kill in the name of the Lord and claim that God gave the the oil under foreign ground.

8695 2018-03-08 02:09:52 Ironic. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil Company back in 1870 and turned same into most valuable company (fossil fuel to boot) of all time. At the height of his wealth, Rockefeller was worth $392 billion in 2016 dollars - 2% of the US’s GDP!

8697 2018-03-08 02:09:47 OMG  Thank you so much for clarifying this! Coz some brands, like The Body Shop, claim that they’re ethical coz they only use sustainable palm oil. Glad to know I should avoid them as well.

8700 2018-03-08 02:08:00 I’m thinking that “proud” is really the wrong word here. Air pollution, water pollution, oil spills are definitely not things to be proud of.
8701 2018-03-08 02:07:49 おいしく調理しないとね・・・料理がんばろ
8702 2018-03-08 02:07:45 Just goes to show that Mr. Jim “The Snake Oil Salesmen” Cramer finally shows that he doesn’t know shit about the sector.  Odds are good, he has some flunkie doing the research for him because he’s way too important to pull away from his dressing room mirror!
8703 2018-03-08 02:07:26 Unfollow HRW because of their ironic, profoundly tahded support of anarchistic terrorist 'rebel' bomb and gun violence in Syria. Their propaganda support helps to pave the way to more U.S. oil wars in M.E., each of which takes hundreds of thousands of lives and displaces millions
8704 2018-03-08 02:07:23 Do you need a styling mousse or a hair treatment bc I use Aussie mousse and shae moisture castor oil leave in conditioner for a hair treatment
8705 2018-03-08 02:07:19 I just drank coconut oil, I think Alyssa needs to sleep
8706 2018-03-08 02:07:17 Best way to get rid of fleas and keep pets off your animals and plants is neem oil, it stinks but it repels all the bugs. And it isn’t expensive so you can just buy some to help him out and rub it on him
8707 2018-03-08 02:06:44 Is cream spinach healthy or is this one of those situations where something is delicious and I pretend the oil has nothing to do with it
8708 2018-03-08 02:06:25 And I love eating adobo with shredded cabbage on the side. MMMM. Next time I'll try adding some more sesame oil to season & maybe a bit of soy sauce. Plus a couple banchan on the side -- maybe eggplant or bean sprouts & kimchi.

8710 2018-03-08 02:06:01 Tar is a product of distillation from petroleum or plant products. Bitumen forms naturally along with coal and oil
People call bitumen tar for the same reason people call concrete cement. Doesn't make it not bitumen
8711 2018-03-08 02:05:49 The fact was it was simply cheaper.  Not a statement on Williamson County's belief in climate science.  And there ain't no oil in these parts.  Just retirees.
8712 2018-03-08 02:05:36 You'd think an oil and gas industry body could afford to spring for helvetica #justsaying
8713 2018-03-08 02:05:08 Because Putin makes money from oil exports.

8721 2018-03-08 02:03:42 Manafort was a lobbyist for a pro-Russian Ukranian politician. Don’t know about $30M to NRA, but Russia paid that much to the Clinton Foundation and $0.5M to Bill Clinton. No need for Russian arctic oil, US is no longer dependent on foreign oil.
8722 2018-03-08 02:03:27 It absorbs excess oil and dirt. GReat to use on days you don't wash your hair! You could also use baby powder applied with a brush and it does the same thing :)
8723 2018-03-08 02:03:23 @TuckerCarlson  Low testosterone in men is due to soy baby formula, soybean oil, soy food products which are estrogenic and in EVERYTHING. Check stats, correlate rise of low T with intro of soy baby formula a few decades ago.
8724 2018-03-08 02:03:03 Right  just covered my head in baby powder so the oil isn’t as bad tomorrow lol

8727 2018-03-08 02:02:55 I love how Carter was basically deposed by the oil industry and Reagan tore the fucking solar panels off the white house and ended US investment in renewables and then we started waging aggressive war against oil rich nations nonstop. good country we live in

8743 2018-03-08 02:00:13 Respectfully disagree. You gotta remember, per recent tweets, you are currently sober; I am currently hammered. Wawa and hammered are peanut butter and jelly. Wawa and sober are oil and napalm.

8745 2018-03-08 02:00:06 They'd probably like burning the extra oil, because it's anti-the-environmental-b*****ks that the EU has been forcing on us?

8760 2018-03-08 01:57:54 you should stop using oil
8761 2018-03-08 01:57:51 Your words read oddly similar to an oil company ‘apologizing’ for a spill with no clue as to how to clean it up.
8762 2018-03-08 01:57:47 There's actually ppl that don't lotion/oil they body after they hop out the shower. My skin be feeling so damn dry and itchy.
8763 2018-03-08 01:57:33 @TuckerCarlson TUCKER, what is causing lower testosterone is #SOY!  Almost all restaurants cook food in GMO soybean oil.  Almost all process food has added the poison seed known as SOY.

8819 2018-03-08 01:50:08 I know that at times cargo ships travel below max speed to conserve fuel when oil is expensive. There is an "optimal" speed for profit and it's not always full speed.

8821 2018-03-08 01:50:04 Keep saturated and trans fat low by choosing less deep-fried food, baked goods, fatty meat, full-fat dairy and fast food. Choose unsaturated fats such as oil or non-hydrogenated margarine instead of butter #NutritionMonth
8822 2018-03-08 01:49:47 If you don’t manufacture then you have to buy from someone else at what price they decide. What are you going to do when they choose to stop selling to you. For example: Why do you think oil prices are so low. Our production went up. It’s pretty simple really.

8840 2018-03-08 01:46:47 This time I used oil instead of butter, brown sugar instead of white and let them get all disgusting before mixing everything. Last time my bread came out all brown, gummy and sad.  :(

8849 2018-03-08 01:45:27 also Alberta was losing that much daily when oil was $100/barrel...it was being lost to energy corporation pockets as conservative governments were falling all over themselves to give money away to their business friends who would in turn enrich the politicians.

8877 2018-03-08 01:41:56 I was wrong, one brand does tell you not to use oil, @Epiphora just told me @funfactoryusa states it because the oil causes cracks in the plastic handles/the control buttons. On a personal level I haven't had any problems but will go update my post to reflect this.

8966 2018-03-08 01:28:19 =awesome have fantastic fabulous time of racing
8967 2018-03-08 01:28:05 As always, it's all about the #oil , 'bout the #oil, no #Trouble 
8968 2018-03-08 01:27:38 I had a neighbour that did the same thing. Double driveway, but he'd park on the street. He told another neighbour that his car leaked oil and he didn't want to stain the interlock bricks. Grr. Get you car fixed! 
8969 2018-03-08 01:27:24 The oil just never washes off! 
8970 2018-03-08 01:26:42 Precisely, which is why I stand corrected. I am guilty of kink shaming. I shall be made to boil in the oil provided by those I've wronged. Seriously though it's a valid point. And like I said I accept I was brash but that's me. #SorryNotSorry
8971 2018-03-08 01:26:25 One suspects that he’d rather be living on a repurposed oil derrick in international waters, if only he could pull together just a few 100k more in gold bullion.
8972 2018-03-08 01:26:18 Oil and because of the war
8973 2018-03-08 01:26:16 Listen to me, Scott. Broccoli florets. Olive oil. Chopped fresh garlic. Salt. 400 degree oven. 20-25 minutes. Put the garlic in halfway through after you toss it around a bit. Shave some Parmesan over the top when you take it out. Thank me later.
8974 2018-03-08 01:26:16 I get some sort of weird automotive stage fright when I get my oil changed. During the turn signal check, I somehow hit the wipers ... forget how to work the high beams, etc. Then I zoom off and don’t think twice about how to operate any of those things.
8975 2018-03-08 01:26:11 Except it's not tar. As a scientist explained to me in an interview, tar is manufactured, bitumen is oil mixed with clay, etc. Pro tip: try interviewing real scientists instead of watching TV interviews with celebrities.
8976 2018-03-08 01:25:59 I still don’t get why our gap is widening so much.  Seems like it should be getting smaller with the oil exports growing.  Last months estimate for gdp had one of the highest import factors in a long time.
8977 2018-03-08 01:25:46 I put coconut oil in my hair but it's cold enough in here that it hardened 
8978 2018-03-08 01:25:43 I want to make my own everyday  coconut oil spray for my hair
8979 2018-03-08 01:25:34 "And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty." ~Luke 16:6 #Bible
8980 2018-03-08 01:25:30 Me: We have to go to the store.
Kid: I bet mommy would love some flowers.
Me, married 9 years: I bet mommy would really love some paper towels and olive oil
8981 2018-03-08 01:25:30 Hot oil treatment for the curls, face mask on, candles lit while I relax and pack. 2 days away from Spring Break
8982 2018-03-08 01:25:27 Organic Coconut Oil
8983 2018-03-08 01:25:22 Republicans are owned by NRA, oil & gas, and Russia. No suprise.
8984 2018-03-08 01:25:03 the bottom oil price graph priced in C$ indicates otherwise but definitely many other factors at play...
8985 2018-03-08 01:25:00 Until all Oil blocks are revoked, Salaries/Allowances of NG lawmakers slash by a third just know fighting corruption is a joke. Corruption today is fought on paper and media. We've lost it people
8986 2018-03-08 01:24:46 I only enjoy Turkish oil wrestling
8987 2018-03-08 01:24:34 Came in from shoveling and immediately took a hot shower, put on some coconut oil, a heating pad on my back and ate some arroz con pollo. This day is done
8988 2018-03-08 01:23:34 Google heard me talking about getting an oil change on my phone mic and started giving me ads on youtube for oreily auto parts after i got the oil change. Isnt technology great?
8989 2018-03-08 01:23:34 I’d like to figure out how we could get that Slavin in a Oil Jersey
8990 2018-03-08 01:23:27 A little bacon, Parmesan and olive oil. Delicious
8991 2018-03-08 01:23:23 Maybe when 1/8th of the Mexican population is in the US and remittances are #2 in Mexican GDP behind auto production and ahead of oil...
8992 2018-03-08 01:23:14 They always take advantage of women lol thats why when they ask and give you some bs saying your air filter is old, just be firm that you only want an oil change and you’ll replace it later lol
8993 2018-03-08 01:23:03 I’m preparing for my trip to Texas and asked my mom what to do if I get bitten by a snake. So she packed lavender oil for me... 
8994 2018-03-08 01:23:01 If you want to see market destabilization; wait until other nations beging to trade oil in other currency other than the dollar. Then the market shit will hit the fan
8995 2018-03-08 01:22:50 Hopefully it stays in London.  Wow, a circle.  They are really burning the midnight oil in Berea.
8996 2018-03-08 01:22:50 I need my car detailed & a oil change asap.
8997 2018-03-08 01:22:13 Like an oil painting that got too hot
8998 2018-03-08 01:22:09 #cdnpoli Canada needs to put tariffs on WATER, SOFT WOOD and OIL. We don't need USA, they sure need us. MAKE THEM PAY, UPFRONT!!!!
8999 2018-03-08 01:22:08 Yeah... Thunder organization is ran like an oil company, it's their way or else, KD was scared of them, 4 good reason!
9000 2018-03-08 01:22:04 the oil on my face is enough to cover hojung's body for his next body building competition
9001 2018-03-08 01:21:30 A4 #SpoonieChat I would need an essential oil diffuser, a jacuzzi & fun things to do that won't aggravate my symptoms.

9011 2018-03-08 01:19:44 what about that beauty oil does it work

OMG it does work

i felt too greasy
9012 2018-03-08 01:19:44 I’m going to rub in the ponds for a few minutes. And then I’m going to do a foaming cleanser just as a last step so I don’t leave the oil based cleanser on my skin. After that I’m going to apply a moisturizer to keep my face from getting dry while I introduce all the new products
9013 2018-03-08 01:19:34 First thing I need a oil change bad
9014 2018-03-08 01:19:33 Wish I could go back to work. Miss the smell of burnt oil and getting greasy. Have fun.

9018 2018-03-08 01:18:51 It's irrelevant. If we care about the climate and the planet we cannot afford to have any new oil & gas drilling. Plenty of evidence for this stance. We are sitting on a major climate disaster. Or are @abcnews & @RNBreakfast climate change denialist now, with the Guthrie regime.?

9021 2018-03-08 01:18:05 After the clay mask is when I’m going to do the oil based cleanser. This is what’s supposed to really help draw out/unclog the sebaceous filaments. I got the ponds cold cream cleanser because it is literally the only oil based cleaner Walmart had, so I might order one from amazon

9024 2018-03-08 01:17:06 They Do know and theyre ignoring the problem. Vegan Outreach and Humane Legue, you can post about yummy foods to get people to go Vegan without promoting palm oil! Sometimes i wonder if Nabisco is paying them or something. 
9025 2018-03-08 01:17:02 Need to move oil because no room in the pipelines
9026 2018-03-08 01:16:40 AND TEA TREE OIL.
9027 2018-03-08 01:16:31 cocoa butter, jojoba oil, and just a whollllleeeee lotta moisturizer, babe.
9028 2018-03-08 01:16:30 Yes, we export our oil and get oil elsewhere with the highest gas prices, get taxed to death so that we can support the politicians agenda of illegal criminal immigrants, and keeping many dependent upon them for the vote. Cali is becoming too liberal & thiis is ruining the state.
9029 2018-03-08 01:16:15 ...or changing your oil before the light comes on
9030 2018-03-08 01:16:14 I don't buy "expert's" opinions. Coconut oil all the way  Don't be blind to the fact that medical opinions are swayed by big businesses.
9031 2018-03-08 01:15:54 After almost 73k miles, my car got its first tire change this morning. I waited longer than I should have to get new tires, but I made the originals last quite a while. This is why I get them rotated every oil change, they last longer than intended. :3
9032 2018-03-08 01:15:46 Things Ive seen today about Lizzie Fletcher...She is anti labor, she is a corporate lawyer in oil and gas (that was a different candidate), she wins cases for fracking rights and “she’s fucking her married boss”. None of that is true. It’s the way Berners operate.

9039 2018-03-08 01:14:59 So I have a couple break outs so I’m using tea tree oil as a spot treatment. I’ll see how my skin looks in the am and give an update
9040 2018-03-08 01:14:52 I feel like if everyone used coconut oil like I did then maybe you’d finally understand. As we speak I’m looking up that coconut oil treatments are essential to keeping dogs from getting bad skin/allergies so you bet my future pup will know more than u all do.
9041 2018-03-08 01:14:51 I keep thinking it’s Russian oil. They all want a piece. Sanctions are making it impossible.
9042 2018-03-08 01:14:50 in hs we had an assignment about human skin where we were shrunken down onto human skin and it described all the sweat and oil and sebum glands on the surface in excrutiating detail and it was one of the only anatomy things that made me actually uncomfortable and nauseous
9043 2018-03-08 01:14:49 bush is the dumbest president we have ever seen. Who sent our brave men and women into the longest war in our history? ignored warnings for 911, lied about the Iraq oil, border fence and bank bailout? Dumb Dumber. And he is the smartest bush.
9044 2018-03-08 01:14:36 The oil in Venezuela is completely nationalised.
Considering their is only one money making industry left in Venezuela and that it’s nationalised, I would say it’s a perfect example of socialism.
9045 2018-03-08 01:14:34 ROFL I WAS JUST REMEMBERING THE COCONUT OIL AND WHISPERING IN MY EAR
9046 2018-03-08 01:14:20 And you have Sherry’s Oil Life Page 
9047 2018-03-08 01:14:00 It's really weird that Guillermo Del Toro made a movie where a giant robot uses an oil tanker like a baseball bat to smack a giant monster in the head and yet that's not what he won an Oscar for.
9048 2018-03-08 01:13:41 Peppermint essential oil is life 
9049 2018-03-08 01:13:36 Idk if anyone mentioned it bc I just started listening but “There Will Be Blood” is based upon Upton Sinclair’s “Oil”. The milkshake metaphor in the flim~ has been used prior to it to describe oil & mineral rights in the US...
9050 2018-03-08 01:13:33 Fact is, it will never stop changing. We are only able to dream of a pollution free world and clean energy because of the awkward phase we went through using coal, oil, gas, etc to get ourselves to this point. Don't hate it, it was necessary. The thing you want will come.

9055 2018-03-08 01:12:37 why does everyone say that reptiles are 'slimy'
mammalian skin is the only one that sweats and secretes oil and sebum and musk and has massive amounts of glands that just pump out gross sticky things all day
mammals are slimy mammalian skin is vile it's MAMMALS
9056 2018-03-08 01:12:35 Ive heard of adding dimethicone too. Similar to how mineral oil is in TPE/ TPR
9057 2018-03-08 01:12:34 Zeroora and he, for Madrid, and at night two were now well in the sequence in contact seemed to oil the town for anything,

9060 2018-03-08 01:11:47 So been allergic to sunflower seeds and oil is one thing but it been set off by foods that apparently don't contain it, this is painful
9061 2018-03-08 01:11:40 The irony as it relates to the free flow of goods across borders is rather thick John.  Oil pun intentional
9062 2018-03-08 01:11:28 ...I’ll go get the olive oil and the Barry White albums. Hope you don’t have anywhere to be for a while. *cracks neck, begins stretches*
9063 2018-03-08 01:11:13 But the ENERGY! If it could be harnessed, we wouldn’t need to be concerned with coal and oil.
9064 2018-03-08 01:11:05 Was there not enough oil there for the US to intervene?
9065 2018-03-08 01:11:00 Agreed! And not soon enough! The damage he has done to our civil rights, our Constitutional rights, our lands and waters- giving oil magnates carte blanche, disregarding our healthcare needs as well as safety nets. My God there's no end to his implosion of norms!
9066 2018-03-08 01:10:56 Now that would be a first! It could only someone from one of the big banks you do deals with or the oil industry or the anti-environmental core or even Disneyland knowing you. #locktrumpup
9067 2018-03-08 01:10:52 @RepSonnenberg if you don’t allow us to say #explosions in a committee hearing because you think it doesn’t pertain to the bill, then WHY would you let Oil & Gas say “finances” and tell everyone lies like they couldn’t afford to elevate health & safety? #copolitics @VickiMarble

9074 2018-03-08 01:09:45 I hope so  I've also recently added a few things to my skincare routine like weekly exfoliating and a face oil  maybe i should get aloe vera to help with acne scars
9075 2018-03-08 01:09:34 Israel wants its own oil.....IN SYRIA
9076 2018-03-08 01:09:33 Each state earns a royalty on oil through the pipeline.  US oil also uses the XL.  
Our oil surplus sells into world markets.  That helps ease the trade Imbalance.

9083 2018-03-08 01:08:22 I truly believe the way an accident is handled, determines how you deal with it. That being said, I took my Jeep to @TiresPlus to get an oil change.

9086 2018-03-08 01:07:39 Alright Boys keep it going. Go Oil Kings Go
9087 2018-03-08 01:07:37 So Scott Wheeler at The Athletic says Oilers are one of half a dozen NHL teams interested in English forward Liam Kirk for draft. The fast Kirk plays for Sheffield in British Elite League at 18. He wants to play in CHL next season. How about Oil Kings draft him?
9088 2018-03-08 01:07:19 Getting oil changed, last car of night. BIG green recycle  sign on wall to explain: “Why disposal fees?” hangs next to U.S. flag. And now watching nice front desk guy empty paper in recycle bins into trash can & take trash out for night. Just real life.
9089 2018-03-08 01:07:11 If you find yourself grieving something such as a former self, person or relationship that ended. Rosemary is excellent in helping to soothe and ease grief. You can eat more rosemary in your meals, or buy rosemary essential oil and dab gently behind your ears.
9090 2018-03-08 01:06:58 why is the government able to build oil pipeline from Mombasa to the west yet unable to build water pipeline from l Victoria to N Eastern?
9091 2018-03-08 01:06:56 depending on what time i wake up tomorrow i might go get my oil changed and tires rotated and balanced

9094 2018-03-08 01:06:47 So they are promoting Oreos without caring that palm oil is involved? Surely, they must know. I'm going to save a pic if that lost little soul on the boat as it has future use to drive this point home. We owe her. A pic most certainly is worth a million words in this case

9098 2018-03-08 01:05:13 So looking on line I see MLAs make $127,000 plus perks now I also see the average household income is $93,000 which is high because of families with oil $ income. So a single MLA should make more than an average household?

9102 2018-03-08 01:03:49 @Oprah tons of billionaires will give you money to run even arab sheiks oil companies,you need promise lower taxes for everyone even companies,college debts paid off by government program,folks poor can apply get HUD HOMES FREE they just pay yearly tax they can move in..

9104 2018-03-08 01:02:55 My hair is covered in castor and coconut oil and it’s formed an outer hardened shell  SOS
9105 2018-03-08 01:02:46 My car says it needs an oil change so I get to drop $75 tomorrow wow I'm so excited
9106 2018-03-08 01:02:42 Having a luxury car is nice till you have to pay for car insurance, premium gas, synthetic oil, registration renewal and minor fixes here and there. Fml. Bittersweet  Idk how I’m doing it 
9107 2018-03-08 01:02:41 Dear whoever created olive oil ice cream,
#thank you!

9109 2018-03-08 01:02:31 Obsessed w my @mydrunkelephant nightly skin routine of Protini & Marula oil  feels so good! #takecareofyourself #skincareroutine
9110 2018-03-08 01:02:28 Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
9111 2018-03-08 01:02:08 Looks good, although it does mask the misery that oil palm has inflicted across the region.
9112 2018-03-08 01:02:04 Achei protetor solar da loreal facial oil- free 45 reias na nossa drogaria vou comprar
9113 2018-03-08 01:01:42 it's about dropping the sanctions .. that's my bet on it ... always about oil and money
9114 2018-03-08 01:01:40 Do you know for sure the fuel pump is the problem? Does it have electrical power? Check fuse & relay. If the pump is energized check fuel filter-Google how to videos for the make/model. If its the pump spray penetrating oil,  then tap each tab all around w/ a flat screwdriver
9115 2018-03-08 01:01:37 Dont compare to Oil money clubs, that’s unrealistic. Compare to pre-ozil era. Since then, sanchez, mustafi, xhaka, lacazette were not cheap. Take into account the club’s wage structure as well.
9116 2018-03-08 01:01:28 the federal government should give back all the land it has stolen to each state for them to decide what to do. Some states could mine or some would drill for oil, some may let it do nothing but it is each states decision

9118 2018-03-08 01:00:55 I have work at 3 so I gotta make it quick and I gotta get my oil changed in this one before I can trade 
9119 2018-03-08 01:00:42 these line drawings with markers (and maybe oil pastels) are fucking everywhere
9120 2018-03-08 01:00:35 IndyRef2 is closer than u think.
When they start tellin u the oil will run out tomorrow, u know it’s time.
9121 2018-03-08 01:00:16 OIL DIFF: 3.32 -> 3.37
9122 2018-03-08 01:00:03 Oil changed and everything checked a couple days ago
9123 2018-03-08 01:00:03 My favorite method to prepare these beauty's is by cutting them in half and then searing them with #infused oil.  The question is which oil.  I love using rosemary or sage oil.  What is your preferred method?
9124 2018-03-08 01:00:02 Stick with the oil. Shit smells .
9125 2018-03-08 00:59:51 #Oil prices tumbled 2.3%, leading to declines in the energy sector after government data showed that crude stockpiles increased and U.S. production reached new heights last week
9126 2018-03-08 00:59:51 Agradezco mucho a @sergioroulier su nota sobre el problema de la refinería Oil, poniendo de relieve la magnitud del tema. Un tema que llamativamente no recibe la atención mediática que amerita.
9127 2018-03-08 00:59:41 #Oil: We keep our neutral stance as we expect crude oil to trade close to its fair  value range of 45-55 USD.

9131 2018-03-08 00:59:38 Thank you Greg, I’m another one who needs opioids just to get through the day. Until three months ago I was taking 4 per day, but now that the government has started its witch hunt my Doctor has decreased my prescription to 3 a day. I’m looking into CBD oil to take up the slack.
9132 2018-03-08 00:59:36 ありがとう！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
9133 2018-03-08 00:59:34 in my history class we debated if the US was justified in covertly overthrowing Iran's gov during the cold war and when we got to discuss our own opinions on it everyone around me was like "yeah I mean we needed the oil" + genuinely tried to argue that we helped Iran...... jfc
9134 2018-03-08 00:59:26 China has a oil/gas pipeline cutting straight through Burma with a terminal at #kyaukphyu on the Rakhine coast, where the Rohingya used to live. They are building a Special Economic Zone and a naval base for PLA(N) there. Geo-Strategic stuff!
9135 2018-03-08 00:59:18 Saw another one of those pain in the ass Dawn dish soap commercials ... They always show them degreasing ducks from some oil spill , never anything about the dish soap ... So I'm thinking (not really , but it's fun to pretend) they should start washing dishes with ducks ...
9136 2018-03-08 00:59:04 Almost like a Hawaiian pizza omelette. I take my olives and mushrooms and lightly sauté them with olive oil, sea salt, and black pepper. I’ll do about 4 cups to have for all week with random stuff. So much good flavor.
9137 2018-03-08 00:58:43 witch hazel as a toner, mask of magnaminty from lush ask a mask, rose water and rose hip oil you’re welcome
9138 2018-03-08 00:58:42 Oil is about to go up! Demand will increase!

 "yeah the U.S. is probably gonna invade them soon"
9142 2018-03-08 00:57:55 Girl. Yes!!! I used the stuffy nose & cough bubble bath & the roll-on oil when I was sick last week & it smells soooo good! It's like menthol, & the orange oil made my bathroom/bedroom smell like oranges!!
9143 2018-03-08 00:57:52 I literally have every oil change receipt from when I had my Concorde (I miss that car ). I have each certificate of registration for each car that I’ve had.
9144 2018-03-08 00:57:44 GARBAGE....Israel is bombing Syria's infrastructure and regime in order to invade and steal the oil. Israel and CIA USA created ISIS
9145 2018-03-08 00:57:39 Bought an essential oil diffusing necklace to help deal with the permeating smell of cigarette smoke radiating off my coworkers
9146 2018-03-08 00:56:54 今日も雨降りなので外出しないつもりでいたんだけど、さっき旦那から用事言いつけられメールが届いたので、花びら浮かばせてこようかな・・・（自分を奮い立たせています）
9147 2018-03-08 00:56:54 So this is how sweet sleeping early is
9148 2018-03-08 00:56:44 Oil filters
9149 2018-03-08 00:56:43 I seriously smell like pure coconut oil and I'm loving it.

9152 2018-03-08 00:56:13 Congrats to Ryan and the amazing students at Mary Butterworth!

By the way, can someone tell me when our little Nugey grew up? Good God...
9153 2018-03-08 00:56:10 Looks like she was under the car changing the oil!
9154 2018-03-08 00:55:53 So your friends with the man who lived off his fathers money from Getty oil, and you are suppose to be the biggest fighter against the oil industry. Tsk Tsk
9155 2018-03-08 00:55:51 When u smell like coconut oil and black girl magic 
9156 2018-03-08 00:55:45 Agradezco al periodista Roberto Paz la nota que me realizó en su programa televisivo. Hablamos de distintos temas importantes xe la ciudad y en particular sobre el problema de la refinería Oil.
9157 2018-03-08 00:55:41 fr if I catch my cat licking the olive oil top one more time...
9158 2018-03-08 00:55:41 何年か前に水に濡れると桜の花びらの絵が浮かんでくるって傘を買ったんだけど、雨の日は極力外出しない主義なのでいまだに花びらが浮かんだところを見ることはない。
9159 2018-03-08 00:55:26 My hair doesn’t like glycerin. I have to mix blue magic olive oil and water
9160 2018-03-08 00:55:01 I recommend the Mario Badescu drying lotion too. And the cetaphil oil control face wash
9161 2018-03-08 00:55:00 I'm gonna celebrate my birthday March 11 Sunday 2pm onwards at the Fil Oil Flying V Centre in San Juan City. Free cheese burgers to the first 50 attendees.
9162 2018-03-08 00:54:45 Melania is at Mar--a-Lago trying to create a fragrance line...This would be ideal for her perfume ...Put in a little skunk oil and call it "Leave Me the Hell Alone." I love it! She can wear it around Donald!!! 
9163 2018-03-08 00:54:33 I'm exploring the differences in shine offered by body butters versus fractionated coconut oil on my skin. 
it's quite interesting.
9164 2018-03-08 00:54:31 Maypa ang coconut oil hahay
9165 2018-03-08 00:54:22 IIRC, the other Dem in the race last time was also from Compton. He was a real fighter...for his big oil and gas industry donors. I don't know Brown's positions and donors in detail, but your interest in Compton comes off as a little condescensing. 
Peace out.
9166 2018-03-08 00:53:55 You can use coconut oil for literally anything, rub a little bit of that shit in your eyes and you can see better dont bother with glasses that make you look like a nerd
9167 2018-03-08 00:53:49 Isn't it funny when they talk about allowing the free markets to fix and guide the economy, then they subsidise oil gas and coal.
9168 2018-03-08 00:53:43 Maybe it should be non-essential oil.
9169 2018-03-08 00:53:41 @Toyota my 2008 camry burns oil. Send me a new one
9170 2018-03-08 00:53:15 gently fricassee two parsnips in sink oil, serve with smashed beef and a garnish of dried menudo
9171 2018-03-08 00:52:22 @TwistedJaaay how’s that oil buuutch 
9172 2018-03-08 00:52:20 America not likely but will overtake Russia on oil and natural gas production it’s only a matter of time it’s a short time at that
9173 2018-03-08 00:52:13 Crunch! Crunch! 
And I should know, because I belong to a food co-op and they sell tons of stuff in bulk: nuts, pasta, coffee, grains, candy, kombucha, honey, olive oil, dried fruit, spices. It's wonderful. @WeaversWay
9174 2018-03-08 00:52:11 Arggghh... we found we had a hidden heating oil tank in the garden of our old house. Full of oil. We had to put money aside for new owners to do hazmat cleanup. Hated that. Somehow previous owners had not disclosed this when we bought. Good luck!
9175 2018-03-08 00:52:10 Well oil be damned
9176 2018-03-08 00:52:08 Gave Chloe a CBD oil dog treat let’s see what happens
9177 2018-03-08 00:51:49 saw those oil drilling thingies again. im still scared of them
9178 2018-03-08 00:51:48 OMG inasal overdose!!! His grammar is usually impeccable! :p note to my love: don’t tweet after consuming too much chicken oil. LEI can’t wait for gumbo niiight!  can we also throw in something creamy to the mix?
9179 2018-03-08 00:51:33 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
9180 2018-03-08 00:51:18 I like the oil painting one for it but it's hard if you're going for small spaces
9181 2018-03-08 00:51:15 Why is everyone freaking out.? @Maddow reported months ago. Is everyone just really waking up to the reality that Yes, this administration is guilty of espionage & treason.Quid pro Quo. Deal with Putin & 45.Enter Tillerson - All about lifting sanctions for OIL & world domination
9182 2018-03-08 00:50:02 ทุกมื้อเช้าหลังอาหาร...มือจะได้กลิ่นคาวปลา ทั้งที่ไม่ได้กินปลา ก็สงสัยนะว่ากลิ่นมาได้ไง สงสัยมากกกกกก จนที่สุดความจริงก็ปรากฏ...กลิ่นมาจาก Salmon fish oil. นี่เอง #กรรม
9183 2018-03-08 00:49:59 USA being the largest oil producer by 2023 is great news for America. Oil industry will add thousands of new jobs and eliminate our need to import oil. Huge boom for the economy.
9184 2018-03-08 00:49:22 40% of Alberta bitumen is upgraded to synthetic crude oil (SCO) that can be processed at simple refineries (most Canadian refineries are classed as simple). SCO is more valuable than light crude but the upgrading cost is significant.
9185 2018-03-08 00:49:18 New tires, oil change and a few other maintenance things I need to take care of tomorrow. Adulting sucks.
9186 2018-03-08 00:49:16 Your are a lier that plastic comes from Saudi or Russian oil . Prove otherwise . Find me a piece says made in Canada
9187 2018-03-08 00:49:15 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9188 2018-03-08 00:49:10 no, but i have a drink bottle, an essential oil burner and a LOT of post-it notes!
9189 2018-03-08 00:49:07 something ive always wanted to do with super sculpey bc of the fleshy color is make fake wet specimens like 'dragon fetus in a jar'
maybe in vegetable oil with some glitter or smth
9190 2018-03-08 00:48:28 I remember when it came as a powder in a bag and you still had to add oil to it.  Man how times have changed.
9191 2018-03-08 00:48:15 My friend told me to use tea tree oil on my scalp, but neglected to tell me to mix it with coconut oil, and I thus almost asphyxiated myself last night.
9192 2018-03-08 00:47:28 You're having issues with acne on your body? Back, arms,your legs? 
All you have to do is take a bath/shower using our "pickmeup" foam wash which has lemon oil,
Teatree oil and apple cider vinegar. Eliminates acne and prevents future breakouts. Balance you PH levels. Moisturize
9193 2018-03-08 00:47:27 Kristina, "privately owned" becomes pretty murky when the company takes tax dollars and meets with Congress. Also, if it is illegal for Russians to "tamper with US elections" on social media it is also illegal for the those social media platforms
9194 2018-03-08 00:47:01 He was off his rocker.  He knows once they open that investigation his Indonesian oil ties with be investigated, too.  The fleecing of CA is over.
9195 2018-03-08 00:46:54 "get the oil, get a bucket, scoop it with your FUCKING HANDS, AND JUST BRING IT BACK, BRING ME BACK A FEW HANDFULS OF OIL, I'LL PUT IT UP MY ARSE, AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO SPACE, I DONT FUCKING KNOW, WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHY ARE WE SO SHIT?"
9196 2018-03-08 00:46:53 Silicone is silicone. I own doc Johnson silicone and other cheaper brands. They are the same. It's all pure silicone. The compatibility isn't brand specific with COCONUT OIL but it is with Silicone Lube.
9197 2018-03-08 00:46:16 I always wondered: did no one ever wonder why nature saw fit to bury oil deep in the ground?  My 7 yr old self wants to know.
9198 2018-03-08 00:46:13 Kai, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. How do you rationalize harming  Gay friendly Oil while supporting regimes that toss #LGBTQ @vancouverpride @uvicpride
9199 2018-03-08 00:46:02 I wish I had somebody to oil my scalp, it’s never as satisfying when I do it 
9200 2018-03-08 00:46:00 yep everything seems to check out! might need sum oil so the  spring action will be able to hold up to my punishment sincerely @Dan_G33 #WPS
9201 2018-03-08 00:45:50 Contracts are invalid if they violate civil rights.
9202 2018-03-08 00:45:35 If it’s in the pan it’s everywhere the oil touched.
9203 2018-03-08 00:45:34 Oil pan in a weird place?
9204 2018-03-08 00:45:31 Almost 70 degrees Sunday and Monday.... you can find me lounging in the back yard in my bikini drenched in tanning oil 
9205 2018-03-08 00:45:31 Yep.  Trudeau gives this guy the floor to slam the oil industry.  How did he THINK this was going to play out???
9206 2018-03-08 00:45:27 Bill, you represent and oil state. Duh.  And as a retiree hes killing my retirement accounts.
9207 2018-03-08 00:45:14 まだまだー！真顔で迎える日が来るまでは若さを楽しんで♪
9208 2018-03-08 00:45:08 or air for that matter. But we do need coal and oil for sure. Yep you need coal and oil to live. Water and air not so much. #MAGA
9209 2018-03-08 00:44:52 Establishing a dominant position on oil at the expense of everything else citizens and other inhabitants of earth need, doesn’t make us more secure. Both of you lack vision and leadership.
9210 2018-03-08 00:44:33 I feel like I could have a world record for most distilled cannabis oil vape cartridges made by hand @GWR I'm making 10,000 a month no machines
9211 2018-03-08 00:44:08 Just asked my friend and she said that her favorite is the SM Argan Oil & Almond Milk Blow Out Cream and the Thermo-Protect Milk from the same line. If you don’t use SM she said the Cantu heat protectant, and the Cream of Nature Argan Oil Moisturizer are nice as well
9212 2018-03-08 00:44:03 Gave this man organic coconut oil when he gout out the shower, and let me tell you...its something about a chocolate man with moisturized skin.
9213 2018-03-08 00:44:01 Turkey breast is a fancy way of saying turkey titty.
Honey is a fancy way of saying bee sauce.
Gas/oil are used to differentiate two car juices.
Coffee is bean juice.
Tea is leaf juice.
Sweat is human juice.
What is life?
9214 2018-03-08 00:43:42 Aztec Clay Mask + tumeric + tea tree oil and ACV 
9215 2018-03-08 00:43:39 i shoulda grabbed some baby oil or baby oil gel
9216 2018-03-08 00:43:38 I've always found coconut oil, heavy cream, cocoa powder, and a bit of sweetener all melted together and then chilled to be very good. Also egg meringues are really good, even with fake sugar, and are pretty easy to make
9217 2018-03-08 00:43:30 For a more favorable take, roasted vegetables are a great way to go. All you need is veggies, splash of olive oil, and your favorite spices. Toss them in the oven and cooking times will vary. Haley recommends Cajun seasoning for some spice!
9218 2018-03-08 00:43:23 A laptop battery is a consumable item, like tires or oil on a car. Purposely gluing it in proves @apple considers its laptops throwaways

9221 2018-03-08 00:43:05 Every now and then a mystical and terrific Danish ENTP oil heiress, waving long and lustrous hair off her face while pulling on a turquoise pair of sweet knee-high riding boots, softly transforming her understanding of a knowingly sweet charcoal grey Norwegian Fjord Horse.
9222 2018-03-08 00:42:53 Augh I got essential oil in my EYE
9223 2018-03-08 00:42:37 Personally he mentioned that his next car will be electric. 
So at least a start. And what a start from the CEO of a oil company.
9224 2018-03-08 00:42:32 -opened up a credit union account today...got my oil and brakes changed, car detailed, dropped my clothes off to the cleaners now it’s bible study time 
9225 2018-03-08 00:42:00 Lip scrub then coconut oil
9226 2018-03-08 00:41:26 Cool!!
9227 2018-03-08 00:40:57 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
9228 2018-03-08 00:40:57 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9229 2018-03-08 00:40:49 And of course the links between US oil lobby groups and KM support are just the way business is done and not worth reporting.
9230 2018-03-08 00:40:36 The look on her little face was absolutely  heartbreaking..scared, alone and not knowing what her future holds. This palm oil issue must come to the forefront. Homes are being wiped off the planet and somehow, these innocent victims are being considered an inconvenience?
9231 2018-03-08 00:40:26 My favorite vegetables and how I like them prepared:
Potatoes - Fries
Corn - High Fruc. Corn Syrup
Vegetable Oil - Chicken fried in vegetable oil 
Leaves - Iced Tea
Bell Peppers - Taco Bell
Olives - Olive Garden
Mint Leaves - Thinmint GS Cookies
Chili Peppers - Welcome to Chili’s

9233 2018-03-08 00:39:58 My dad just said my lavender oil smells like ant piss 
9234 2018-03-08 00:39:49 a wise man once said that when the Donald tries to formulate a clear sentence, a tibetan monch wants to become politician
9235 2018-03-08 00:39:45 South Sudan officials dismissed the [Sentry] report, with presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny telling Reuters that “The oil money did not even ... buy a knife. It is being used for paying the salaries of the civil servants.”

9237 2018-03-08 00:39:34 I'm thinkin if I should draw a picture of Mitchell Trubisky then color him in with oil pastels then laminate it as a poster #10
9238 2018-03-08 00:39:25 Thats a misconception,its invested interest that prevents most of us from oil free options.
9239 2018-03-08 00:39:10 WASENT THERE A TIME WHEN TEXAS WAS FULL OF OIL DARICS AND TEXENS MADE BILLIONS OFF OIL? PEOPLE WE NEED OUR OWN STEEL,OIL,AGAIN! ITS TIME

9241 2018-03-08 00:39:01 I remamber during the Fort Mac fire some heartwarming stories of Albertans coming touther to help evacuees.

And horror stories on how the oil companies just let thier workers hanging in the wind.
9242 2018-03-08 00:38:53 Any luck with the oil? 
9243 2018-03-08 00:38:45 Bradbury and Asimov.

Also, you need 350 degree oil and a knife along with those potatoes. Some salt helps a lot too.

9252 2018-03-08 00:37:23 They did the background, oil pastel and paint in one day. Drew the fruit and painted it in another day and the third day we made the basket and glued it all together! I found plastic fun fruit at the dollar tree!

9256 2018-03-08 00:36:38 Do you know me? I started making silicone toys 20 years ago. My company is Tantus. Pjur and Tantus did tests of silicone Tantus toys in silicone Pjur lube with no effect. And there is no way silicone degrades with a plant oil. The toys are mislabeled or you assume it’s silicone

9262 2018-03-08 00:35:47 Canada has a hydro industry - Quebec is exporting to the US grid. We have a nuclear industry that used to be admired around the world. We have wind and solar industries.  Oil, gas, mining and quarrying combined are only 9% of our GDP. Why increase that instead of doing better?
9263 2018-03-08 00:35:31 @nailogical if you're going to use that essential oil thing from your stories make sure the ingredients in the oils aren't toxic to cats. Lots of them have ingredients that can hurt your babies.
9264 2018-03-08 00:35:16 The company has been seriously mis-managed in terms of shareholder value. Time for the present board to step down and get some real oil/gas people in place. The accountant and the vulture need to call time on their positions and move on.

9267 2018-03-08 00:34:49 If it wasn't a subsidy Malcolm the IMF wouldn't describe them that way. These are people eminately more qualified to make that call. "farmers" DON'T have the same arrangement. The allowable claims less than those available to Miners & Gas & Oil Producers. #BanSubsidies
9268 2018-03-08 00:34:14 Don't go adding any olive oil. That's a myth.
9269 2018-03-08 00:34:01 wow literally can’t get my oil changed anywhere bc it’s exotic
9270 2018-03-08 00:33:51 Someone needs to create an essential oil called leave me the hell alone, I’d rub that shit all over
9271 2018-03-08 00:33:35 AB Govt is now talking about billions in additional subsidies to get more upgrading capacity. Were they actually getting a significant return from the oil industry, that might make sense. Maybe we need to import a few Norwegians. #abpoli #bcpoli

9274 2018-03-08 00:33:02 Yes, the West indirectly created Radical Islamic Terrorism by injecting oil cash into an otherwise irrelevant Wahhabi clan.
9275 2018-03-08 00:32:52 Key themes @CERAWeek Day 3: @OXY_Petroleum and @Chevron climate risk reports; the friction between simplicity sought by #TCFD and complexity of oil and gas; risk of climate-led investor flight from hydrocarbon economy; @VaclavSmil and the organic evolution of energy systems.
9276 2018-03-08 00:32:30 And an excuse for America to be involved in the middle East, not for terrorism like they say, But for the oil and drugs there. So much evidence leading towards government involvement and it shows that my government is a bunch of selfish oligarchs falling for the human condition.

9279 2018-03-08 00:32:13 So they aren't out to cripple our energy industry. They seek to alter it so it focusses on sources that we hope won'tbkill the planet. And you are campaigning against that. How many oil&gas lobbyists have talked to you?

9287 2018-03-08 00:31:13 You interpret "energy" as being oil and gas. That shows how warped your view is. Protesters tend to be quote vocal in their support of other forms of energy. You misrepresent them as anti-energy. Canada has hydro, a nuclear energy industry that needs a boost, and other options.

9292 2018-03-08 00:30:33 Yes. Now industry can dump mining waste directly into the rivers and streams, oil spills are in again, big banks can gamble with our assets, consumers will depend on themselves without govt intereference, etc. Why, it’s like old times.

$BHP is happening NOW, looks at $USD, Iron Ore, & OIL imports into China

9307 2018-03-08 00:28:13 So true! Here's the most recent:

- Allows country to be raped for oil
- Ignores opioid epidemic
- Guts Medicaid & Medicare to pay for tax scam
- Allows sick fuck trophy hunters to bring severed heads into U.S. 
- Kicks out Dreamers
- Allows Russia to run our country

Thx Donnie!
9308 2018-03-08 00:28:05 So you have to check the oil in the generator, too?
9309 2018-03-08 00:27:47 Let them go through a full winter with no oil..... wait to talk with them until June of 2019
9310 2018-03-08 00:27:45 @realDonaldTrump  (aka David Dennison) - A true President for the 20th Century because he will bring back the Steel Industry and the Coal Industry along with Oil  Drilling and eventually Gas Guzzling Car, etc., etc.
9311 2018-03-08 00:27:36 you are entitled to your opinion. But please tell us how it feels to be doing the bidding of US oil companies' interests in the name of environmentalism at the same time affecting the income of Canadians & the ability of us to pay for heath & education?
9312 2018-03-08 00:27:07 that's a very positive reading article for pipeline supporters : / in other news Oil sands = Tar. Oilsands sounds lovely for Alberta and TAR sounds nasty for the environment.
so from now on call it what it is. it is TAR ask @BillNye :)
9313 2018-03-08 00:27:06 There's always been cross-border smuggling, but C&E don't stop people at the border. Fireworks are banned in Ireland, as are fake cigarette brands, which mostly enter the EU via UK ports. Adulterated petrol is another issue as is red diesel and home heating oil in diesel cars.
9314 2018-03-08 00:27:02 @nailogical  with the essential oil diffuser you have, be careful with some of the oils you use because certain ones can be harmful to animals.
9315 2018-03-08 00:26:59 Heavy oil is not comparable to light. However, when bitumen is upgraded to synthetic oil, as it is in 4 AB plants, it is more valuable. It is not BC's opposition to a pipeline that prevents AB from realizing value. It is the reluctance of AB industry to invest. #abpoli #bcpoli

9318 2018-03-08 00:26:23 In summary, just how fucked are we? Can we turn this around? Of course the @gop are doing nothing. I swear there is a conspiracy involving all of them. Money from a huge oil deal coming. Something totally underhanded. Their inaction speaks loudly.

9323 2018-03-08 00:25:18 @AAACares Lavista Rd. in ATL put my life in danger. What was supposed to be a simple oil change turned into engine light on AND a car that accelerates when you're NOT touching the gas pedal. Their response at cust serv... 5-7 days for someone to be in touch. #unacceptable
9324 2018-03-08 00:25:08 You do not really believe that @realDonaldTrump cares what we want? Big oil corporations are people too just with more money and power. The only reason they had these hearings is because they had to.
9325 2018-03-08 00:25:06 There is no incentive for the oil companies to build a refinery because they would not get so much more for dirty oil to offset the investment in a refinery.

9331 2018-03-08 00:23:46 None of these properties is "damaged by oil". It wouldn't be in gaskets, spark plug wiring, cooking tools, food storage, medical implants, or plastic mold making if that were the case.

9335 2018-03-08 00:23:11 Do you drive a car? How do you heat your house? You couldn't live without oil !- Canada will be nothing without oil revenue (what else do you have?)- and now you won't have steel either. But you're in good hands with Mr. Bollywood. LOL!
9336 2018-03-08 00:23:05 $60 is normal if it’s good oil. any kind of lower end oil would be around $40 - $50
9337 2018-03-08 00:22:52 Alberta also believes they’ll get more for their oil in China. This is ludicrous because it’ll still be dilbit and added to the cost of extracting those chemicals there will also be the cost of transport over the Pacific. I think they’ll get much less than they do now.
9338 2018-03-08 00:22:47 Will there be enough spent oil for dirty visors or maybe front wheel slippage? Seems silly not to collect it in a pot.
9339 2018-03-08 00:22:43 I suspect there is a lot more veg/seed oil today than 50 years ago, and people likely enter service with more metabolic derangement due to pre-enlistment diet
9340 2018-03-08 00:22:35 I bet Alvin Kamara eats nightshade vegetables sautéed in olive oil.
9341 2018-03-08 00:22:15 He still owns at least $5 million in company stock and keeps at least $1 million in a personal account at First Western. Among his other varied investments are at least $250,000 in mineral rights and oil wells in his home state.

9349 2018-03-08 00:20:38 According to Wikipedia, dilbit also contains as much as 25% naptha and Benzene. Alberta would have you believe that they get less for their oil because the US is crooked, when in reality they get less for their oil because there’s less oil in a barrel of bitumen.

9371 2018-03-08 00:18:36 First, the petro is different with other cryptocurrencies. because it's lead by Venezuela. 
second, Petro is used in fixed prices for crude oil produced in Venezuela.
9372 2018-03-08 00:18:35 Notice that bit about being tested in oil? If someone made a platinum silicone spatula and platinum silicone broke down in oil, there wouldn't be silicone spatulae. But there are.

Reminder: platinum isn't a grade of silicone. It's the catalyst used in the crosslinking reaction.
9373 2018-03-08 00:18:34 Their hellfire - bloody lord of the underworld slathered in whale oil (from a lamp) wedged into their love pocket
9374 2018-03-08 00:18:02 Conservatives were content for 25 years to watch our oil resources be controlled from Houston,so the lame promise of keystone was enough for their lame minds,never accepting we might have to ship oil west.
9375 2018-03-08 00:17:42 Yeah. My biggest concern is, where is the oil going? Is it leaking? Is it burning? It doesn't just disappear.

Nevertheless, if you want to buy a Nissan car, it's their written opinion that leaving a veritable oil slick behind is normal.
9376 2018-03-08 00:17:24 Binge watching Broad City and eating Naan with olive oil could life get any better??
9377 2018-03-08 00:17:15 Still up... still doing assignments. Burning the midnight oil Anyone else up? Need someone to keep me alive.
9378 2018-03-08 00:17:12 Thanks for the condescension. It isn't warranted. I started studying the petroleum economies of southeast Asia as part of my first degree decades ago and have continued to watch the oil producing countries with interest. You are wrong about the long-term.

9380 2018-03-08 00:16:22 Why did you ask, then, if you know that it's being paid back? Scotland at least provides revenue from things like North Sea gas & oil. Britain has no "selfish, strategic, or economic interest" in the North.
9381 2018-03-08 00:16:06 idk if it's like onions and garlic, but w those rubbing your hands on steel (like your kitchen faucet, a spoon, w/e) will fix those. other suggestion from The InterWeb: coat w olive oil & wash after a few mins, rub w unbrewed coffee grounds, or rubbing alcohol/vodka.
9382 2018-03-08 00:15:46 Lockheed Martin spends millions each year lobbying the US congress to oil the military machine with more funding.
9383 2018-03-08 00:15:33 I'd change your oil, write a Haiku, and warm your bath, what's it take sugar, oh not butt stuff,,
9384 2018-03-08 00:15:19 He has rolled back almost all EPA regulations regarding air,water and noise pollution, have multiple oil leaks into streams in the West, he has rolled back rules regarding important food safety regulations, threatening our food supply, the list goes on ad nauseum. Try reading.
9385 2018-03-08 00:15:09 Oil is the problem.    Canadians are ready right now to go electric.

Only thing preventing this is Alberta and their compliant politicians like Trudeau.
9386 2018-03-08 00:15:08 Peppermint, Wild Orange & Lavender oh my!  Last month we had such an incredible & successful essential oil study with over 80 people that we decided to do it again. We are switching things up a bit and focusing specifically on digestion, sleep and stress! Want to join? PM me!

9389 2018-03-08 00:15:03 I'm officially pissed off. I just spilled half a bottle of 30 dollar skin oil. 
9390 2018-03-08 00:14:34 Food grade silicone is platinum silicone which has been immersed in acetone, ethyl alcohol, oil, and water, and not leached anything out in harmful amounts. Medical grade undergoes different testing depending on intended purpose.
9391 2018-03-08 00:13:52 fucking yourself with a banana and pouring hot oil over your toad is good practice
9392 2018-03-08 00:13:35 Canada needs to make world market price for Canadian oil a requirement of NAFTA. Then there would be no excuse for Americans blockading a Canadian pipeline to tidewater.
9393 2018-03-08 00:13:17 You can add my name to the long list that do not want our oceans ruined by oil.
9394 2018-03-08 00:12:55 Thanks for the research. What effect do you think would a major stock market correction have on oil prices even if your comparative inventory thesis were true? Thanks so much.
9395 2018-03-08 00:12:44 Not an 'oil FIRM! Oil soft! Man made entity having marginal legal status doesn't get 2 screw the health of thousands 2 please idiot shareholders. So up theirs! They R not the bosses!

9412 2018-03-08 00:09:49 Bush deciding bin laden didn’t matter was the biggest slap in the face. 3000+ dead on 9/11 and he’s like “oh well, I don’t think about him much. Where’s my oil money from iraq?”  Weaponized the govt? Bush started all the spying. Typical conservative projection.

9417 2018-03-08 00:09:38 A quick healthy cooking fact. If you sauté your kale in olive oil it makes it easier to scrape out of the pan into the garbage.
9418 2018-03-08 00:09:32 new hair oil
pros: hair looking less like hay and more like hair
cons: applying so much oil you look like shit 
9419 2018-03-08 00:09:26 Hii kuya @JustinKiness! Have you tried human nature’s cleansing oil? Is it good? Would you recommend it esp. for people who dont have the budget?
9420 2018-03-08 00:08:58 Attempts to control the weather was fully operational more than 40 oil, railroad, steel and other “trusts” that were wielding their rapacious monopoly power to gouge consumers and interfere with the efficient functioning of the American flag. Gee, I wonder why the Oscars disabled
9421 2018-03-08 00:08:26 ...& why did President Trump approve pipelines/reduce regs on oil production, etc. Look at the Mideast recently?

Putin never preferred Trump.
9422 2018-03-08 00:08:25 First oil commission is DONE! Can't post yet bc it's to be a gift.  Now I wait for it to dry... 
9423 2018-03-08 00:07:23 Hi, I've worked with silicone for over two years. While some oils can inhibit the curing of platinum silicone, once cured, there isn't really any interaction to speak of. The polydimethylsiloxane chains simply don't react with oil.
9424 2018-03-08 00:07:22 My own lived experience mirrors reality. Same with many other people who've chimed in on Twitter or the blog. I've used mostly coconut oil  for years. Again, look at all the silicone kitchen items which come into a lot of contact with oil.
9425 2018-03-08 00:07:20 I’m gonna start doing my own oil changes fuck the wait
9426 2018-03-08 00:07:08 Looks like a beautiful oil painting.
9427 2018-03-08 00:06:48 @SebastianComedy some guy in Subway just asked for 25 percent oil and 75 percent Vinegar on his sandwich. What!!!!!

9429 2018-03-08 00:06:35 Id like to rub oil all over that ass.
9430 2018-03-08 00:06:29 The IMF describe them as "Subsidies" Malcolm.  Unavailable to all but a select few.  Oil, Gas & Coal are essentially the only beneficiaries.  Allowable claims to farmers. A fraction of what's afforded to fossil fuel industry. End Fossil Fuel #Subsidies
9431 2018-03-08 00:06:24 I bet if I asked a Chik-fil-A employee to check my oil, and tire pressure they would.

9432 2018-03-08 00:06:20 Carbon tax is very small part of gas price.  High prices due to inadequate domestic supply.  Unless we solve supply end, we might as well resign ourselves to paying the highest price for gas and oil products in N. America.
9433 2018-03-08 00:06:01 Just spent $25 on a oil change , & got it right back on a scratch off 
9434 2018-03-08 00:05:25 I will be anointing folks with oil tonight in a service of healing. There’s a small part of me that scoffs, but the truest part of me aches for these physical reminders of God making all things new— even us, even, or especially, in pain and brokenness.
9435 2018-03-08 00:05:16 If tariffs are so great, and we have a huge trade deficit, why not put them on everything? Why not bananas? And cars? And oil? Rubber? Why not apply tariffs on everything we operate in a deficit over?
9436 2018-03-08 00:05:14 I love how my sister cook w coconut oil shit be smelling so good

Worth 470 mil in 2015, Cut millions in education funding, and etc.@RobdotThom let me know when the strike is I’ll be there.
9441 2018-03-08 00:04:06 The oil and gas field in Deir Ez Zor - Russians Wagner's mercenaries  assault of SDF - Tillerson will never ask for a #NoFlyZone4Afrin
9442 2018-03-08 00:03:42 Also amazing: that a city with thousands of oil wells & countless miles of underground pipeline has no clear protocol for citizen reporting of possible spills / leaks. I called @CalConservation's DOGGR, City 311, and @MikeBoninLA's office. No one knew.
9443 2018-03-08 00:03:41 Ok CBD oil just kicked in and so much is happening lol but I’m about to watch a women’s soccer game get ready for some heated tweets
9444 2018-03-08 00:03:41 Wet chemical extinguishers are the only ones to use on cooking oil & deep fat fryer fires but can also be used on class A & class B fires.
9445 2018-03-08 00:03:33 Oil, oil... Thanks @hhp !
9446 2018-03-08 00:03:22 I didn't think it was possible, but a couple weeks back I saw it happen. We're talking about a SHITLOAD of garlic and olive oil here, mind you.

9457 2018-03-08 00:01:56 I... Never said anything about silicone lube. THAT is the one some manufacturers will tell you not to use. Coconut oil and other plant based oils are not at all the same. You're conflating the two.
9458 2018-03-08 00:01:48 Canada needs to stop subsidizing oil shipped to the USA You should be paying current market rates. Works both ways asshole.
9459 2018-03-08 00:01:33 That’s great that your focus is on moving BLM headquarters versus just straight up protecting land that has been protected for generations from corporate interests like oil and gas. Way to fight the good fight...#2020byebye
9460 2018-03-08 00:01:13 I would suggest that if you dared be so sloppy and shallow in criticizing (rather than bolstering) the oilpatch, you would soon find yourself without a position at the think tank established with oil money and with a dubious record of such disingenuous research...
