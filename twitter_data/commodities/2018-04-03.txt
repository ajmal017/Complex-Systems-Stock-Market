3 2018-04-03 23:30:22 Drugs, children, money, all sorts of commodities. Time to lean on the governments of Central America.
4 2018-04-03 23:16:17 Trump is destroying the World Economic Order that took long time to establish and has been benefitting citizens of the world. Consumers will end up paying a whole lot more for their daily needed commodities!
5 2018-04-03 23:06:58 Oil shorts maybe :-) commodities never fare well in these scenarios
6 2018-04-03 23:01:55 The variances of love alone would be hot commodities.
7 2018-04-03 23:01:35 Ok well, yeah, the patriots generally dont like the value of drafting wr and rb early. Bust rate on wr is too high (so they get vets) and they view rb as commodities like most smart teams in the league.
8 2018-04-03 22:53:58 And I get that trust me. But 1. you cant change when you’re born  2. People seem romanticize the time when there were plenty of things wrong with it. And 3. If they truly wanted to be in that time they would reject at least SOME of the commodities we have today.

41 2018-04-03 20:51:23 In a free market, this exists in agricultural commodities.
42 2018-04-03 20:36:24 yes, although commodities have inherent value (e.g. ornamental and industrial for gold), and securities are underpinned by the cash flows of the issuer.
43 2018-04-03 20:35:07 Listed under commodities indeed
44 2018-04-03 20:22:20 This is fuel Grammer u r talking about which never ever changes. But prices do. And look at the current prices of most of these commodities.

52 2018-04-03 19:30:22 they haven't spelled it out--

oil and LNG to a degree sell themselves (commodities) but selling more to China is an easy way to move the needle on the bilateral balance.  energy exports drove much of the '17 increase in US exports to China
53 2018-04-03 19:15:26 Stop trading with China, and the US debt will skyrocket from high commodities costs and huge layoffs, which causes less consumer confidence and less money being pumped into the US economy, which results in less money to offset past and future debt. The economy will collapse.

56 2018-04-03 18:44:38 there's a lot to say, but one point is that these calculations equate market value with material welfare. In terms of actual commodities, there's more than enough for everyone - food is the archetypal example

59 2018-04-03 18:31:53 Agreed. Business is vastly important to the US. Statecraft requires more than intrntl business skills. When states are run as businesses, people become commodities, & states become inhumane. This notion of conservatives that a businessman as Pres can solve everything is strange.

79 2018-04-03 17:03:38 Our media exists for consumption's sake. Facts and a stringent adherence to truthfulness are less valued commodities than hyperbole and partisan alliances.

117 2018-04-03 15:17:16 Sadly, this proves the point that whether crypto-assets are “securities” or “commodities” both irrational investment demand or fraud can create boom/bust events;  the lesson is to focus on APPROPRIATE disclosures and basic principles of investor protection in regulation whichever

122 2018-04-03 15:10:40 We don’t know if they are shorting these stocks for their benefit. Carl Icahn for example made a bundle of $$ selling steel stocks before Trump announced tariffs. Maybe his buddies are doing the same with other stocks and commodities.

130 2018-04-03 14:50:16 I understand your point, but even though we animals eat other animals there are ways to raise and butcher what we eat that are not cruel. Not on an industrial scale in which animals are mere commodities though. Nevertheless, cruelty is not why the dairy industry is suffering.

232 2018-04-03 06:47:17 Because people don't misutilise petrol and diesel that's y it's kept out of GST .
If these commodities become cheap then india will be boiling with rising temperatures

234 2018-04-03 06:25:45 That is the triumph of advertising in the culture industry: the compulsive imitation by consumers of cultural commodities which, at the same time, they recognise as false.
235 2018-04-03 06:17:44 Tbh - I don't think there will be one solution as there isn't at the moment. Different companies use different amounts of commodities. It's still evolving.

I'm curious about your opinion of where the crash happens and how deep it goes.

That said, when the shit really hits the fan, it's all about gold and silver. And if it's a bad enough crash, 1/

257 2018-04-03 03:06:08 Sorry - honestly can't. As you likely know, food commodities have a lot of very specific inputs. Day traded DBA briefly, but just too much more to follow!

I was saying we shouldn't tax to fund govt commodities, subsidies, and bail-outs.
You know the difference. You're a smart guy.
271 2018-04-03 01:34:56 It's a mixed economy. It taxes to fund commodities the free market can provide. 
It should just be taxing for goods the free market cannot provide.
272 2018-04-03 01:31:50 Taxing private income to fund public goods the free market can't provide is taxation. 

Taxing private income to fund govt commodities the free market can provide is legalized theft.

274 2018-04-03 01:26:03 Damn I said goods, not commodities.
