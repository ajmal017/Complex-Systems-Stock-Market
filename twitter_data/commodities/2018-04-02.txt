Socialism is an immoral method of funding commodities. 
It's also a proven in-road for full nationalization, and fascism.
2 2018-04-02 23:53:57 The free market system is the most moral one.
Governments don't take private income from citizens to fund public commodities in a true free market system.
3 2018-04-02 23:49:20 Even the historian you're using as proof said the Nazi's used the established socialist policies to fund their efforts.
Socialism is immoral enough when it's used to fund public commodities. It's even more immoral when used to fund what became a genocidal Fascist dictatorship.

If the U.S. govt. is nationalizing companies, or keeping them alive with subsidies and bail-outs, that is because it forces taxpayers to foot the bill for commodities.

39 2018-04-02 22:07:36 China’s government said on Sunday that it would immediately impose tariffs on 128 U.S. commodities it imports in retaliation for President Trump’s levies on steel and aluminum. The tax on U.S. goods could include pork, soybeans and fruit as well as aircraft. #magaFail #Moron

41 2018-04-02 22:05:24 Let ME break this down for YOU

China sells their shit to EVERYONE. They have a lot of money to lose, but it's just a fraction of their total earnings.

 AMERICA buys ALL of its commodities from china. We outsource all of our industry to them. Without them, we have NOTHING

50 2018-04-02 21:19:52 “Real estate can still be a good investment, according to Johnson, but not necessarily living in the home you own. Being a landlord or investing in real estate-related stocks and commodities can be more lucrative than keeping all your capital in the nest.“

54 2018-04-02 21:05:02 3233: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
55 2018-04-02 20:53:12 Incorrect. My argument is that the allocation of funds is not what it should be. We're paying for services, not commodities. The Ferrari comparison doesn't work because we aren't making a one time purchase. It's like paying for internet, the more you pay the higher the bandwidth.

60 2018-04-02 20:23:45 That's exactly my point. Here the museum tells THEIR story using artefacts of protest that, by being displayed without dialectical analysis, become reified... commodities, literally. Yet the real dialectic is why should museums be seen as guardians & tellers of our stories?

67 2018-04-02 19:47:37 Furthermore, the farming industry will nearly be ruined. On top of that, prices of certain commodities will skyrocket. NAFTA may not be great, but you cannot get rid of it without a better option. Hence, negotiations currently taking place.
68 2018-04-02 19:30:19 To be honest higher ed is also slashing majors if they aren't cost effective. Higher Ed is a bottom line business with students looked at as commodities.
69 2018-04-02 19:28:57 Maybe people would save or invest more if they didn’t confuse cash with wealth, and they were educated on other forms of value storage like metals, commodities, currencies, bonds and stocks. Also, on the imminence of inflation and depreciation of fiat money.
70 2018-04-02 19:28:56 I'd have to see a lot more evidence before I agree with that. We currently devote a far lower proportion of our people, land and time to producing food than we used to, and even producing commodities. It seems likely that trend will continue, even with growing population.

75 2018-04-02 19:05:04 MISLEADING!!! The pre-Trump tariff on these commodities into China for pork- 20%+VAT and most others 10%+VAT. This move is mostly symbolic.
76 2018-04-02 19:04:47 FOX News commercials say a lot about their viewership. Investments in alternative commodities (for the paranoid types), shameless displays of the cross (for the evangelical types) and reverse mortgages (for the not-so-bright type).
77 2018-04-02 19:02:50 The US owes $121T+.  If commodities are only priced in USD's globally when we print that (as Greenspan notes), we'll inflate the world tremendously.  If we don't print that much, the US will rip itself apart politically & elect someone that will print it...

79 2018-04-02 19:02:02 Also , this is totally applicable to commodities and services. Women are neither. Gender issues don’t neatly fit this model and are subject to other forces, primarily the way men and women treat and value each other ( #complicated) and also law making etc must be based

115 2018-04-02 16:37:07 Flipping through an interior design catalogue while listening to an audio book of about Marxist "fetishism of commodities" is queer culture.
116 2018-04-02 16:36:27 Govt is fooling us ...They should know this type of hike directly effects the growth of people .....govt should work on reducing the transportation charges .....As most of the commodities are transported inter state...
117 2018-04-02 16:33:55 Sure, as long as we're including defense, public works, national intelligence, law enforcement, consumer protection, etc. as commodities.
118 2018-04-02 16:29:51 Regulated private ownership is taxation. It's being used to fund government commodities on top of goods that have no private competitor.
Nationalization of commodities requires autocratic enforcement should the private citizens refuse to participate.
119 2018-04-02 16:24:17 Kind of hypocritical. China can cherry pick commodities they want to tax. They will impede the import of products for domestic consumption but are they going to apply tariffs to the products processed by Chinese labor and shipped back to the US?
120 2018-04-02 16:18:20 We may evolve the policy a bit in the future since not all platforms are created equal despite some of these commodities being the same (XPS is superior in ways well beyond the commodities) so get your requests in ASAP while it still reads as-is.  TY for your patience on this.
121 2018-04-02 16:09:45 Please just rename the ABC becoming more like commodities.
122 2018-04-02 16:09:13 China imposed tariffs on a range of U.S. goods. including a 25% penalty on American pork and 15% penalty on fruit and 120 types of commodities

137 2018-04-02 15:12:57 In Facebook's business model, humans are commodities. As we remembered just weeks ago when the Cambridge Analytica story broke, they play w our information w little (if any) regard for its use.

139 2018-04-02 15:06:11 the banks dont trust eachother - they specifically mention that, but  they do trust the market and market structures, like commodities, oil,  gold, real estate. They trust in those, so a crypto that is said to have  a value based on retail value (and FI, and companies) is perfect
140 2018-04-02 15:05:52 I think this is where we need to focus! I’ve always been a fan of glass, but any packaging that has similar reuse qualities!
I’m also in favour of using your own containers, perhaps there’s scope for more door to door sales of commonly used commodities (milk, cereal etc.)?

161 2018-04-02 13:30:38 Sounds about right, and with pork in particular, but also apples, citrus, and other fruits, it targets commodities that have shown good growth and have strong growth prospects as China's consumers become more affluent.
162 2018-04-02 13:29:33 Yes Diesel prices are at 4 years high. But why essential commodities of common people are at 4 years low. For the common people essential commodities are Onion, Tomato, Potato,Banana, Tur Dal, Urad Dal, Masoor Dal etc etc.
163 2018-04-02 13:24:44 Okay one caution here.

E o crescimento foi por conta do preço das commodities e o endividamento facil.

255 2018-04-02 04:11:14 Because China will be charging 25% more for pork products, apples and almonds our farmers sell to China.  I believe China is a sizable market for US farmers and as the price raises for US commodities, demand will decrease.
256 2018-04-02 04:05:13 And there goes a significant number of red state voters. Farmers are going to get killed by this. Bacon is going to get cheaper for awhile. And wheat, corn. The commodities market could tank as well... so much winning.
257 2018-04-02 03:55:14 Yes yes congress had taken India to great height.They were reducing the price of commodities periodically. But after all these good things they couldn't win the election and they continue to loose state elections.And you babies are crying price rise price rice.lets see in 2019

274 2018-04-02 02:41:22 A crise começa em setembro de 2013, com a desaceleração da China e a redução das cotações das commodities no mercado. A balança comercial bate recordes negativos na sequência e durante 2014, dos 4 trimestres,  em 3 o governo federal tem déficit primário. Mas a eleição foi mais

278 2018-04-02 02:04:05 Sometime hard decisions require sacrifice.  Commodities are not plentiful in China.  We can wait them them out. Besides it maybe better served to route it to those in need within our own boarders.

282 2018-04-02 01:42:27 De acuerdo contigo en que no hay lealtad actualmente y es algo que sucede en todas las industrias, con todos los potenciales clientes se invierte tiempo y se hacen cosas gratis, y en publicidad los clientes estan convirtiendo a las agencias en commodities
283 2018-04-02 01:42:00 Personally I hate GDT always have but u might be right a lot less risk involved.if you ask any European farmer NZ have been dumping cheap commodities on their market for 50 years 
284 2018-04-02 01:40:48 Interest Rates are Still Very Low. As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—The Dollar & Bond Yields will Also—As Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Oil, Corn Etc.) Fall.  Just a Matter Of Time.  #EconomicCycle
285 2018-04-02 01:15:35 2. Im not sure why you mean by this, prices exist under systems which include money or other form of commodities eg thr gold standard. Socialist ones have a higher oppurtinity cost due to a lack on insentives to produce at thr lowest cost possible relative to competators.
286 2018-04-02 01:04:24 #China is increasing the tariff on pork & aluminium scrap by 25% It's also imposing 15% tariff on 120 other #USA commodities, just remember #Trump loves & thinks trade wars are great & easy to win.

288 2018-04-02 00:59:01 Es una estupidez los precios garantizados. Los commodities deben fluctuar a libre oferta-demanda. Así es en los mercados internacionales!
289 2018-04-02 00:57:51 Durante esse período de “bonança” não se sabia que o comportamento das commodities é cíclico? O que fez o país para minimizar o impacto do período de baixa? Ou fomos pegos de surpresa?
