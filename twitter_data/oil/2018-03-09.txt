2 2018-03-10 23:59:17 Yes, my business practices were fair. I worked hard enough to make the oil industry in this country the most efficient that it ever was. For me, it is called, as Herbert coined it, survival of the fittest and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Business is business.
3 2018-03-10 23:59:12 Algeria 1.5 million in Iraq and Syria Lbia 2 million killed..This 8s what you have supported. Also %7 of Kurds Syrian population invaded %30 of Syrian Arab soil. Why? For oil and gas pipes from Qatar Iraq Syria to establish kurdistan and greater Israel well it is over.
4 2018-03-10 23:59:10 Who are you protecting us from? You have become the axis of evil.
We fought in Afghanistan.
We knew you were full of shit about Iraq. You protect no one unless they have oil.
The world needs protection from you. We want a wall.
Guns are the problem. Too many and too easy to get.

32 2018-03-10 23:54:14 So update to this story.  Got an oil change this morning and they cleaning my windows.  Now it's raining.

34 2018-03-10 23:54:04 Yes, for real. Don’t want you to overheat or loose pressures or water or oil.  Keeping an eye on your gauges, even in a streetcar prevents problems.
35 2018-03-10 23:54:01 Yup.  Swapping in a new (rebuilt) 4.0.  Old was leaking oil like crazy and I think the bearings were pretty worn.
36 2018-03-10 23:53:44 Except the pharmaceutical industry develops "medicines" that are just snake oil, over charges people to use them, for problems they don't really have or even address if they did, and subsidized themselves, that way, also.

It's a racket & we don't have a system that prevents it.

39 2018-03-10 23:53:10 coconut oil or shea butter could help.
40 2018-03-10 23:53:04 Yes, you are probably correct.  And I am sure the NRA would be out there spraying that slope with gun oil.

44 2018-03-10 23:52:44 FED began rate rise the Euro Dollar was 1.42 and by late January 2016 it had dropped to 1.06 on the intraday.
Price of oil had dropped from plus $85 in Summer 2014 to $26 in January 2016.
During same time period demand remained at near constant arc.
It was all FED, not demand.

50 2018-03-10 23:51:25 I use powder to keep the oil at bay and it's normally okay but if I get super warm then nothing seems to control it 
51 2018-03-10 23:51:08 We’ve been screwed on oil once we decided we would buy our oil from elsewhere. thank goodness that has turned around! This year, US is expected to surpass Saudi Arabia & to rival Russia as the world’s leader, with record output of over 10 mil barrels a day!!

55 2018-03-10 23:50:39 Then why do you think the koch brothers, pharma, health-insurance, oil/gas, spend so much money on campaigns. Pharma spends the most on campaigns/lobbyist & some how Americans spend the most on prescription drug prices, how does that happen.

61 2018-03-10 23:50:00 This used to happen to me... try a over night sleeping mask, I think I used the Fresh brand at Sephora. You just need a lot of moisture! Or you can exfoliate but super lightly to get the dead skin off then put an oil on at night ( I swear by the Pixi rose oil blend)

67 2018-03-10 23:48:54 Is oil not purchased on future options most of the time? If so, what is the maturity date of these futures.  I feel we are just feeling the compounded effects from years past still.  It should be the Government's responsibility to monitor and regulate, but why they reap the taxs
68 2018-03-10 23:48:16 Asked Bae if he seen my oil he like nah and then walks in wit a fresh new bottle 
69 2018-03-10 23:48:07 Interestingly this feedback cycle apparently wasn't started by market demand but by extensive lobbying and distortion from the car and oil industries.
70 2018-03-10 23:48:05 And thank God that our forefathers had the foresight to see what could happen in the future if someone like tRump became potus and there wasn’t something in place( the constitution)to keep this country from becoming a dictatorship. Mr Mueller, keep burning the midnight oil!!!!!!!

76 2018-03-10 23:47:37 No, no, no.  CEPA must be denial ed if this palm oil is to be encouraged.  Indonesia do not regulate palm oil production effectively and have a terrible record of killing orangutans when they return to the palm trees. They are not to be trusted n environmental matters.
77 2018-03-10 23:47:33 End our dependants on oil
78 2018-03-10 23:47:32 It’s getting built....it needs to get built...it makes sense unless you want Canada to continue to be a single purchaser oil exporter which means we sell for 30% less than we should and as a result we have less to reinvest in other perhaps greener technologies...get over it

82 2018-03-10 23:46:02 This gets me mad. If they weren’t so obsessed with pleasing putin by drilling for oil and gas, we could be forging ahead with renewables and really doing amazing things with advanced technology. We could clean the oceans. I’d like an initiative to get jobs going here in renewable
83 2018-03-10 23:45:54 Does it have truffle oil on it? If it does... probably...
84 2018-03-10 23:45:54 just sweat all my coconut oil off
85 2018-03-10 23:45:29 Also Lil’ Marco, the 2nd Amendment uses the phrase “...to KEEP and bear arms...”. KEEP means you can “preserve and maintain” not “own”. So I guess you can fondle, break down, clean and oil your guns - you just don’t have a constitutional right to OWN them?
86 2018-03-10 23:45:05 ขอบคุณมากๆนะคะ ตอนแรกคิดว่าตัวเองผิวมันเลยไม่กล้าใช้ oil เลยค่ะ แต่มาถึงจุดนี้ลอกเบอร์นี้ เดี๋ยวจะลองหันหน้าหา oil ดูค่ะ
87 2018-03-10 23:44:46 Read, for example, Michael Kidron on Foreign Investments in India.  Initially, Western firms were invited to drill for oil in India. They dug  a little & gave up. Then came the Nehruvian push on oil. Such  examples can be multiplied.@rafi17 @Dhume
88 2018-03-10 23:44:41 Remember in the 70s when the elitists caused a gas shortage saying we were running out of oil. Somebody is always manipulating & ppl believe everything they want you to believe. Humanity does tend to be 
89 2018-03-10 23:44:36 Telesur tv lmao. Thats the venezuelan version of rt or presstv. The current crisis is result of economic mismanagement and corruption. Few years ago chavez was going around the world sharing out venezuelan oil money.

93 2018-03-10 23:44:23 Bae bought the pets some CBD oil so they can chill out during the day while we’re at work - esp remy cuz he has anxiety. I put some in his water before bed and Rem slept in til 2pm 
94 2018-03-10 23:44:13 whenever my car asks for an oil change or even gas i really sit there and think... what about the bus...
95 2018-03-10 23:43:59 Nothing causes me more anxiety than when the oil popping out of the frying pan

104 2018-03-10 23:43:03 I've put the dashboard back together, replaced the filters and changed the oil, so I thought the car would be ready to roll again. But then I've found a really nasty place in the circuitry, so I'll spend the Sunday afternoon soldering swedish wires... There is no end. ;)
105 2018-03-10 23:42:58 The fall off in rig count in Canada would be focused on Natural Gas and liquids and not oil. Totally two different markets.
106 2018-03-10 23:42:25 make an oil painting of sidlink you coward
107 2018-03-10 23:42:15 I do not. Looks like a neat product - but I'd be worried about some branch or debris flipping the little handle and there goes my oil. Might be good on a show car... but I wouldn't put it on a daily driver.

114 2018-03-10 23:40:30 Honestly haven't tried them with anything other than a tablet. But I assume they would work since it's basically blocking off any sort of oil or sweat which is a main cause of smearing in the first place. So I'd say yeah
115 2018-03-10 23:40:26 Just lathered my whole body in coconut oil I’m glowing from head to toe

117 2018-03-10 23:40:16 I'm also a BCer who supports Alberta oil. These hypocrites rely on fossil fuels for transportation, the manufactured goods in their daily lives, including their computers, their clothing and the food they eat. Worse, they're the puppets of foreign interests that wish Canada harm.

134 2018-03-10 23:37:31 Have you tried CBD Oil to manage your symptoms?  Many people have had positive results with it.
135 2018-03-10 23:37:29 Dr Mercola put me on Cold Press Virgin Coconut Oil, avocado, free range egg, lots of home grown greens, Turmeric, Cayenne pepper, ginger..
136 2018-03-10 23:37:26 Oil is best. The important thing is to keep the hairs moisturized.

138 2018-03-10 23:36:30 I've been doing this for about a week it is challenging because I put the intermittent fasting into the equation I eat from 12-6 That is a short time to get in you calories. I also found mct oil helps add good fat it is tasteless and adds a nice amount of fat.
139 2018-03-10 23:36:08 In regards to the beard products there are a few options:

1. A customized oil based on your personal needs (patchiness/increased growth, frizziness or dry beards, irritated skin, and post-shave remedies) daily use

2. A beard shampoo for daily use

3. A beard balm for daily use
140 2018-03-10 23:35:46 Ppl complain that oil will run out and drive the country to oblivion. But forget that as a supply of a good goes down therell be excess demand which will drive up the price and thus itll become so costly ppl will look for cheaper alternatives.

Also, reading ingredients in processed food only gets you so far: eg. "vegetable oil" is usually a random mixture of whatever happened to be cheapest that month, and almost certainly includes corn oil as a major component.

didn't just create a refugee and refuge processing market for ex child solgers+isis allies of the Israel usa house of saud war monger machines for oil and arms sales
238 2018-03-10 23:20:22 Twitterers from Alberta seem to think BC can’t use any oil unless we accept ALL THE OIL. I’m going to go ahead and continue practicing moderation, thanks.
239 2018-03-10 23:19:46 Well - in West Africa, (where I lived for 5 years) each village has a dozen oil palms they process & add like a condiment to their cooking. Its a bit of an allergen. but its one of the few sources they have in their diet of Vitamin A. Its given to kids as a preventative medicine.

246 2018-03-10 23:18:39 We are selling our oil at a massive discount because of the pipemine backlog. Translation: we are subsidizing U.S. energy costs at a detriment to our economy while they ramp up in preparation of being the largest eneegy producer in the world. And those are facts.

248 2018-03-10 23:18:27 They’ve also managed their resources well, such as in Norway by not letting oil companies keep all the money.

252 2018-03-10 23:17:59 I'm old enough to remember the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, when gas prices rose sharply.  People traded in their gas-guzzlers for compact cars, and started carpooling, taking public transit, or walking.
253 2018-03-10 23:17:47 As long as greed and laziness prevails then so will fossil fuels. Do you really think dirty energy is smart? Is oil cutting edge technology? #dinosaurbrain you want to rid the earth of clean air and water? Then keep doing what youre doing. I choose hard work and bravery. #cowards

256 2018-03-10 23:17:17 You’ve hit the nail on the head by stating it’s according to the papers. That means it’s absolute bollocks and there is just as much chance of me getting a oil rubbed tit wank from Kelly Brook

260 2018-03-10 23:16:54 Without combing or brushing, oil stays at your scalp and needs to be washed away. Wash regularly w/ dread soap & scrub your scalp.

262 2018-03-10 23:16:53 Coming from Alberta we tend to have a different perspective which is that he’s not doing ENOUGH for oil. So either way he’s gonna lose on that front lol. It’s a no win situation.

266 2018-03-10 23:16:38 Just tend to bung a whole loaf into a roasting tray with olive oil, and add to rice/quinoa/couscous once cooked. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice will help to bring the flavours together

291 2018-03-10 23:12:25 So what you're saying is; that oil & water do not mix?
You're saying, the marxist multicultural experiment is not working?

297 2018-03-10 23:10:37 Technology and industrial revolution, automation are all because of human ingenuity. If we didnt not have fossil fuels all things we have today would still be possible. Oil cartels surpressed cleaner, renewable energy because it affected their projected profits. #greed

311 2018-03-10 23:08:55 well at least the solar way or wind way of getting power doesn't make sink holes from pulling oil out of the ground

313 2018-03-10 23:08:29 State Auto & Tire on Rt. 9 is straight up trash. Don’t ever go there if you need anything done on your car. Charged me $130 for an oil change and told me I needed $2k worth of shit done to my car which I absolutely did not need AT ALL. FUCK THEM

318 2018-03-10 23:07:55 LOL! Blood oil? H'okay then. Blood oil is what Quebec imports on a daily basis. Nobody was murdered in the production of or extraction of AB oil people.
319 2018-03-10 23:07:51 A simple job of oil changes and brake pads turned into a days long job of dropping a oil pan to get a snapped bolt

323 2018-03-10 23:07:17 Went to get an oil change for my dads truck. Though I was closest to the register and door an employee came through, completely ignored me (who was closer to him) and asked my boyfriend how he could help him. How. Fucking. Annoying.
324 2018-03-10 23:06:46 Yall using coconut oil as lube I have no time. Its 2018 we know better than to use comedogenic products

326 2018-03-10 23:06:06 Had a homemade frittata before going on a long walk/hike through Forest Park this morning. Just mixed a new batch of my beard oil, and now I’m drinking a double dry hopped IPA with lactose. 

I’m fully living up to my stereotype today.
327 2018-03-10 23:05:36 You fell for it!  The American oil industry is laughing at your gullible ignorance as investment and jobs leave Canada and head south of the border. This is your legacy.
328 2018-03-10 23:04:45 Just voted...season 4.  The Oil Crisis 
329 2018-03-10 23:04:45 Putin is orchestrating all of this. Just read any article re the Russia pipeline to SK and the gain of control of oil supply to the whole peninsula. Russia is one of the only countries that trades with NK so he has power there. Trump is window dressing.
330 2018-03-10 23:04:45 #beauty #cosmetics
best under eye highlighter? 
& 
best oil control powder or primer?
331 2018-03-10 23:04:40 Nope. Chavez created the nations wealth by nationalising the oil fields. He died. Now the oil companies want it back. The US have been manipulating politics in central/South America since panama and you think all the issues are socialist? You’re a fool!
332 2018-03-10 23:04:25 ...sanctions He signed into law and won't enforce because he let's Putin have his way; just like he let's Russia get away with giving NK oil
333 2018-03-10 23:04:18 We should have a radio debate to discuss the attack against Canada’s natural resources and why environmental groups ignore oil imports to North America.

Lots to chat about, how about it?
334 2018-03-10 23:04:18 لا خير ظبط وضعه لا تجحفلونا
335 2018-03-10 23:04:07 Lemming, it’s exactly what you are.  I bet you use oil products, so that makes you a hypocrite too.  Nice to see your ilk are so easily controlled.  One day it will catch up with you my simple friend.
336 2018-03-10 23:03:49 If you mean Joolz at The Little Potting Shed Café,  then yes.
337 2018-03-10 23:03:12 1. It's not a proven fact that it was murder. That's just something opinionated people are asserting.

2. "Free to the uninsured" doesn't mean much when A) we all pay for the insurance collectively, and B) it's illegal to be uninsured in the US
338 2018-03-10 23:03:09 pumpkin seed oil is doing amazing things for my hair rn
339 2018-03-10 23:03:00 They are probably against the east west pipeline as well which would use canadian oil in the eastern refineries rather saudi arabian oil brough in by tankers to the east coast
340 2018-03-10 23:02:53 God help Venezuela.  And yes, we should rescue them, take their oil (as opposed to giving it to someone else... ala Iraq)  Then help Venezuela reset and give them their oil back.
341 2018-03-10 23:02:46 Damn girl, are you oil? 

Because I would like to pipe you down on foreign land and start a war over materialstic item. In which we lose thousands of American lives and Foreign Lives over greedy men and companies profit gain.
342 2018-03-10 23:02:41 So once you stop the pipeline any thoughts to what your next step would be. Perhaps shutting down all industries in B.C. And Canada because there isn’t any that don’t rely on oil and gas.
343 2018-03-10 23:02:19 Like I said, there's one in the making. Just difficult to fine 10 producers willing to sign up.

352 2018-03-10 23:00:56 They need to hurry up and change my oil
353 2018-03-10 23:00:50 I scramble 'em with a little oil, salt, and pepper and pour the mix into muffin tins, then wrap them in tinfoil and pop 'em in the toaster with some grated cheese on work mornings: instant breakfast!

360 2018-03-10 22:59:11 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
361 2018-03-10 22:59:00 We possibly did. Perhaps in the same room.

368 2018-03-10 22:57:19 The article talks about exactly that point... I'm not saying I'm convinced - land use is still a massive problem in any attempt to replace hydrocarbons with plants - but the massive increases in oil yields they discuss are a fine step in the right direction

371 2018-03-10 22:56:27 It’s Venezuela’s crypto currency that is backed by oil & mineral reserve.
372 2018-03-10 22:56:09 #Helima #Croft your statement about rapprochement between Putin and Saudi Arabia is a proof that you don't know Putin and Russia sorry Russia is behind Iran 40 years and is trying to create oil monopoly but there is much more.
373 2018-03-10 22:55:50 So, basically, you’re blaming the press for your naive blunder, since you can’t admit you made a mistake. If you only had actual professionals in the State Department instead of one old geezer who only wants a big oil deal with Russia. But you haven’t hired any.
374 2018-03-10 22:55:43 Yeah...let the Chinese, French or Russians sell them arms. We should stop buying this oil use coal instead.  #Dumbassery
375 2018-03-10 22:55:41 Its like you and @Madame_Flowy watched it together
376 2018-03-10 22:55:34 Accepting superdelegates in a party named the "Democratic" party reminds me of when someone defended "BP" after the big oil leak because they were an "American" company. It's just wrong.
377 2018-03-10 22:55:30 What is Android P? Anti freeze or oil?
378 2018-03-10 22:55:19 Beard oil, flat paddle brush (will keep it neat n smooth without feeling like you're ripping pubes out), bit of balm to style and shape! Done. Just experiment with different oils n balms/butters till you find what you like!

386 2018-03-10 22:54:24 I understand it but until there is a very large source of renewable energy, the oil and gas still needs to flow. Do these people not drive? Do they not heat their houses?  Where do they think this comes from?
387 2018-03-10 22:54:22 Baby oil sleep ova  !!! Lol. 
388 2018-03-10 22:54:18 Cheap, indeed. I already feel it going to my head... You can be glad that not even the strongest oil can wipe you from your feet. *giggles and sucks on the straw again, whispers* ...oh boy... If that gets worse, you might have to carry me home.
389 2018-03-10 22:54:12 For fuck's sake, Ken. This is why you need to take your oil.
390 2018-03-10 22:54:09 Coconut oil soaks

399 2018-03-10 22:51:53 So President Jimmy Carter tried to restore balance back to Iran, he helped return Iran's exiled leader Ayatollah Khomeini back to Iran. The karmic debt was simply too high and even then Iranians utterly hated what the USA Gov, Texas Oil Barons and the CIA did to them.

403 2018-03-10 22:50:51 It s sad some self claimed Syrian nationalist are pouring oil on SDF while they could praise their fellow Syrian brothers and call for *positive and safe* reintegration into Assad Syria.

Due to this climate, Afrin SDF was reluctant to get back, now bombed, Syria infra destroyed.
404 2018-03-10 22:50:46 Carter, the raging failure. A few things we remember, painfully are: destroyed our preeminent global Nuclear energy leadership (today it’s EDF,France), oil/refining capacity, forked over the Panama Canal, allowed for the rise of radical Iran & many remember 17-22% mortgage rates!

407 2018-03-10 22:50:19 That is not the reason. It's about greed and oil and control.
408 2018-03-10 22:49:38 How do you work that out? Scotland is self sufficient in energy, food, water, has an educated workforce and all kinds of produce and natural resources, like whisky and oil. How does that compare to England and Wales?

411 2018-03-10 22:49:34 Yes President Jimmy Carter learned of the filthy,disgusting dirty tricks the Texas Oil Barons in collusion with the USA Gov CIA had played on Iran, collapsing the Iranian Gov, planting a Shah Stooge to steal Iranian Oil and torture the hell out of protesters with the Savak.
412 2018-03-10 22:49:33 I was just wondering what happened to Grover Norquist and suddenly there he is on @cnn being the same garbage human I remember, and I didn’t even say his name three times in the oil slicked puddle on my street.

414 2018-03-10 22:49:23 If you support environmental-friendly products then you should be very much against regulations because regulations keep these coal companies and oil companies they keep them on top

423 2018-03-10 22:48:14 Obama lifting 50 year oil export ban sure helped USA.  Definitely wanted Canada out of his markets.
424 2018-03-10 22:48:02 Brought my car to get an oil change and the guys keep looking at it and taking pictures lol 
425 2018-03-10 22:47:48 I’ve been wrestling between the benefits of fish oil and the hazards of elevated mercury levels and I’m just glad it’s over.

427 2018-03-10 22:47:43 The "Petro" differs from other cryptocurrencies because it is backed with a commodity ( barrels of oil)  and it is the first cryptocurrency made by a government.   Isabella Pérez Ruiz
428 2018-03-10 22:47:32 Fair points @ianbremmer. But geopolitical and geographical situation is decidedly different. To the north it’s unlikely China would ever invade or allow US to invade. To the south it’s complicated. And unlike Khaddafi or Hussein Kim doesn’t have oil reserves that are of interest.

430 2018-03-10 22:47:00 Why did Robert Gates assume Tillerson would be a great SofSt -enough to recommend him to Trump?Gates knew Till through the Boy Scouts and from Gates's time as president at TAMU, the top petrol engineering school in the world. Gates knew Till's history with oil in Russia.

432 2018-03-10 22:46:48 Then build pipelines because right now oil has the railways all jammed up and prairie farmers can’t move any of their grain
433 2018-03-10 22:46:18 Funny how Obama lifted 50 year ban on oil exports right before he left.  So much for the green warrior.  Shipping CO2 all over planet

464 2018-03-10 22:42:04 SO 

I have a really good way of cooking fish that everyone here likes. I’ve been doing that with a huge pan of veggies cooked in butter/olive oil with some seasonings. It’s turned out great every single time.

466 2018-03-10 22:41:50 Hi there! Talc occurs naturally as a mineral deposit and is valued for its softness, and is generally used in cosmetics as it is great at absorbing moisture and oil to help the skin feel soft, fresh and dry.

528 2018-03-10 22:32:48 Anyone living in the western world who hates oil must live in an animal skin hut with absolutely nothing man made in their possession in order to be free of guilt. Im all for conservation of a resource but lets be honest about how the world got to this point
529 2018-03-10 22:32:47 Example: let’s say oil rig is burning. Supervisor is supposed to do “x” as per protocol and call control centre to receive instructions. However, he knows from experience things are going to go “boom” - he chucks everyone into the ocean. Things really do go “boom”

537 2018-03-10 22:31:52 The NDP have changed over the decades in Ontario just as the PCs have (from Davis to Harris to Ford, yikes).

The pipeline we really needed was to the east. And I think we need to get our oil from our own country & shld refine it here too.

540 2018-03-10 22:31:16 It may be time to recognize that Alberta's cash cow has been milked dry, the world is weaning itself off oil, and that the resource base of the province can no longer support the current population without a radical rethinking of its basic economy model.

547 2018-03-10 22:30:18 You say that like he actually aimed to shoot her.
The gun went off in his hand and ricocheted off the groud before hitting her hundreds of feet away.  This was scientifically proven by the defense at his trial.

554 2018-03-10 22:29:13 I really wonder if the world understands that everything in our world and i mean everything at this point has some relation to oil ( plastics, medicine, heating, lighting infrastructure) its more than just automobiles. Without oil we die or at least 6billion or so
555 2018-03-10 22:29:03 Power to the people protecting what truly matters -- not lost revenue -- lost resources, lost ecosystem, lost climate, lost sustainability, lost life, lost humanity. We don't need oil to exist, we need water, air, food, and love. #StopKM #stopkindermorgan #RallyinVancouver

558 2018-03-10 22:28:10 Actually we do own the oil. Anyway. .... don't you have a joint to go smoke?
559 2018-03-10 22:28:06 Just not using oil is not a feasible option for the middle class. You need a vehicle to get a decent job, and because oil companies own the patents to good electric car batteries, they can charge insane royalty fees for the product. This is why Teslas are in the $100,000 range.
560 2018-03-10 22:28:03 When Randall on This Is Us said “I wake up every morning next to a headscarf and coconut oil; I’m married to a Black Queen,”
561 2018-03-10 22:27:31 Yes. I do. Where I see the entire gas/oil usage being use for rebuilding, and not for profit. In that case, Most definitely.  If i saw re-direction of assets, I would completely agree
562 2018-03-10 22:27:00 I've got the coconut oil in as we speak, and there's a charcoal facemask in my near future.
563 2018-03-10 22:26:50 i’m getting my oil changed and I feel horrible cause my mechanic is saying he sold his first gen cards for super nice bedsheets 4 his ex like I’m so sorry
564 2018-03-10 22:26:32 You mean a dangerous view from a disgraced snake oil peddler? You're right. I forget we should air their views unchallenged.
565 2018-03-10 22:26:22 Except that electing NDP was anathema to Albertans since forever until they did. We also still need oil for many things beyond (and in addition to fuel). And until we support a non-resource economy, our dollar will remain Petro-dependent.
566 2018-03-10 22:26:19 Yea, corper ko, a cooperate affairs?
567 2018-03-10 22:26:13 Lol

.no, the pittance of royalties. We dont even own the oil! My industry alone brought in over 2 billion in BC last year. Legal cannabis will double that. We have tourists who want to see our pristine environment. You maybe need to help NFLD, NB, PEI, NWT, YUK but not BC.sorry!
568 2018-03-10 22:26:09 Of course: only EPIGENETIC snake oil works!

573 2018-03-10 22:25:14 Hahahah! Just so we're clear, is it all 10 of you will get the permanent positions that are sure to materialize from building oil dependent infrastructure?
574 2018-03-10 22:25:10 Twitter friends, I am trying to figure out how to make a good omelet. My biggest issue is that the bottom is getting dark and the middle is a bit runny. I’m using oil and butter, starting on high heat for 30 seconds then moving to medium. Any tips?
575 2018-03-10 22:24:34 Arabs are now being punished for waging 1970s era Oil Shock. an Arab led Opec oil embargo that could have dismantled Israel.
576 2018-03-10 22:24:29 money will put oil out of business if we would allow capitalism to be unregulated
577 2018-03-10 22:24:13 Me: I'm interested in over-acted steaming hot messes
BBC: perhaps we can interest you in #TroyFallOfACity - it's all that plus baby oil
578 2018-03-10 22:24:07 I don’t have to use my oil and breakout control face mask anymore. I finally found a cleanser that does that and makes my face super soft without drying me out. I’m so happy y’all 
579 2018-03-10 22:24:02 That facial expression does. You look very East Tennessee right now. I don’t know whether to run or ask you how much you charge for an oil change.
580 2018-03-10 22:23:45 NRA not paying you enough Marco? Attempting to fill the snake oil salesman vacancy when the huckster Billy Graham died?
581 2018-03-10 22:23:32 Kina ganin Hadiyya kenan,MD musa's daughter
582 2018-03-10 22:23:26 oh shit. that reminds me that I still haven't done my taxes. bleh. I had to get the front brakes replaced, plus a rotor? and the heating had to be fixed. so almost $600 when I went in for an oil change. yay.
583 2018-03-10 22:23:12 This is so irresponsible! We don’t NEED this oil!
584 2018-03-10 22:23:08 Does anyone use primer oil and do you like it?
585 2018-03-10 22:23:02 If City win - “Oil Money”

If City lose - “All this oil money and you still can’t win”

What do they have in common? - Oil Money. 

Do we care what rival fans think? - Do we fuck 

Why’s this funny? - Coz rival fans would take our owners in a heartbeat.
586 2018-03-10 22:22:56 I wonder.
If you use olive oil as a vaginal cream, will it change the VVC to VVM? You know vulvovaginal Malassezia.
587 2018-03-10 22:22:50 So concrete blocks and plywood . What's the oil output creating those again? *headsmackingwall*
588 2018-03-10 22:22:49 That case is different, but I'll ask Sani ma y he decided to talk,lemme WhatsApp him naji from d horse mouth.
589 2018-03-10 22:22:36 I could take my whip to the dealership and get a free oil change. Or i can drive a short 3 miles to take 5 and not have to leave my car
590 2018-03-10 22:22:33 Who out there believe it is a good idea for the Federal government of Canada to  reopen the constitution to allow it to govern the non renewable rescources such as oil and mines and allow the Provinces continued control of renewable rescources such as forests and fisheries?
591 2018-03-10 22:22:32 Ok, I'm at the headquarters... Civil and building dept, drawing room.
592 2018-03-10 22:22:21 This place did oil changes on my truck and car in record time
593 2018-03-10 22:22:07 Oil OLI oli oli
594 2018-03-10 22:21:56 this restaurant really advertises vegan options but admitted that their fries are fried in the same oil as chicken and their veggie burger is grilled on the same surface as beef soooo y’all lying lmao
595 2018-03-10 22:21:49 A big reason I’m a fan of olive oil is how it tastes nothing like olives.
596 2018-03-10 22:21:41 Lol
597 2018-03-10 22:21:23 so do you use oil? like do you use anything that requires oil? if you do your aiding the problem and they produce what you want, so stop wanting it.
598 2018-03-10 22:21:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
599 2018-03-10 22:21:12 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
600 2018-03-10 22:20:47 the bottom right hand photo actually looks like an oil painting - how did you achieve that in your shot?
601 2018-03-10 22:20:44 European Union doesn't have free trade within the Euro Zone, never mind with US. If we put tariffs on car & electronic companies, Euro Zone will collapse. It's been long enough that USA pays for European security from Russia. We help by driving down oil & gas prices.
602 2018-03-10 22:20:38 well we dont live in those countries if they allow oil dumping thats on them.
603 2018-03-10 22:20:38 Not at that level
604 2018-03-10 22:20:30 I didnt see u ai,neither did I know the dept u were posted

606 2018-03-10 22:20:20 Never said away games..making a declaration not an answer to a stupid/rhetorical question. So lame the arguments for pro oil. #weaksauce history will put your place. Your children will be disappointed you sold them out for shirt term gain and laziness to change. #nomoralcurrency
607 2018-03-10 22:20:13 Oil diffuser for the car... 
608 2018-03-10 22:20:03 なるほどいさわさんが言うならそれが良いに違いない(:3[___]
609 2018-03-10 22:19:55 Yes!!! I'll have to snag them after then, maybe another oil slick decal for my new comp case...
610 2018-03-10 22:19:49 If your going to shampoo with a harsh shampoo, pre-poo before (drench hair in some type of oil or moisturizer)
611 2018-03-10 22:19:40 See there the difference. .. I don't suport the oil and gas industry to be "cool". I support the resource industries because they are the economic engine of our Nation.
612 2018-03-10 22:19:34 No toxic food chain? Herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, corp mine,oil contamination?
613 2018-03-10 22:19:22 The other obvious thing is that pregnancy is so different depending on circumstances. The things I could do at 20 with my first do not compare with my abilities at 40 with my ninth. 

Do wish I'd known about the oil though! 
614 2018-03-10 22:19:11 Black stockings and oil please ^^
615 2018-03-10 22:19:10 Red diesel is the same as normal diesel except for the dye. It’s dkdonthe same as “ 35 second” heating oil, though that has even less tax. But it’s legal to use red diesel  as heating oil. ( some oil heaters use “ 25 second” oil, which is a different viscosity)
616 2018-03-10 22:19:05 the other day my car exploded while driving. the cop who stopped told me i needed oil. yeah ok jackass, let me just go dig up a fucking oil well! some people
617 2018-03-10 22:18:55 Shine you cant even come to my side ko, ba damuwa nasan zamana da kai.
618 2018-03-10 22:18:54 Girl! I got my hair cut then went to the nail place next door to get my eyebrows waxed and the bitch dropped wax in my freshly cut/washed hair.... and then I went back next door and they helped me get the wax out but used oil so they said to go home and wash it again and omy home
619 2018-03-10 22:18:47 Eucalyptus + Peppermint oil.. thank me later
620 2018-03-10 22:18:37 We seriously have a illegitimate president installed by Russia. We must work together to flip blue in nov and get his racist, oil loving admin out. This is #resistwithstyle. Now carry on with the party. 
621 2018-03-10 22:18:27 just spent my last two cents on an oil diffuser and chick fil a fries
622 2018-03-10 22:18:19 What? Exxon was dumping oil in South America 10 years ago because it was cheaper than disposing of it properly. There is no room for ethics in capitalism. It's simply not profitable.
623 2018-03-10 22:18:09 Update on coconut oil use: using it for my ends after I wash my hair. A fucking P L U S
624 2018-03-10 22:18:05 It's goin to sound weird but it works ivory soap water/ cold water rinse Listerine cold water rinse warm water rinse and jergens healing lotion  (yellow label) as a moisturizer....i see you have a beard the Listerine and tea tree oil helps with hair bumps...good luck king
625 2018-03-10 22:18:02 My dad changed my oil for me,
Got to spend time with my family, and then had a yummy lunch with hubs. Annnnddd it’s nap time 
626 2018-03-10 22:17:45 No it's VC you are bringing not CV, you no serious self, I dey think about my own fate
627 2018-03-10 22:17:35 These men of God will one day have to answer to God.
Jesus saves people who are tired of their evil ways, not snake oil salesmen.  Lord have mercy we have really lost it.
628 2018-03-10 22:17:34 I'm amazed. My dad had a premonition in his dreams a few nights ago that my car's oil was low and when we checked it actually was. How did he know?!?
629 2018-03-10 22:17:29 dont forget all the oil lobbyists
630 2018-03-10 22:17:21 Ghosty is one happy car rn. I vacuumed her, washed her, gave her a full tank of gas and checked her oil. I also went shopping at my favorite store and am going out tonight. What a great Saturday

633 2018-03-10 22:17:01 I like to roast them in [insert your preferred cooking fat/oil], salt and pepper. They’ll taste like the best roasted carrot you’ve ever had.
634 2018-03-10 22:16:59 After 

We drinkin straight up car oil 
635 2018-03-10 22:16:59 Don't worry dear, I will tell @Ebuka and even pour vegetable oil in your dm for easy passage. Ojoro master like you, wait till tomorrow jare 
636 2018-03-10 22:16:40 @lakembra @kendollinhide that’s missing the point. When you do so much shit for someone and in return they only reluctantly accept the buttsex, it’s demoralizing. Be enthusiastic FFS.  I didn’t really care to change the oil earlier either but I did it goddammit
637 2018-03-10 22:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

Brown is in his late 70's, CA's Tax Collection Agency is engulfed in Scandal, & even Brown took huge sums of money from "Big Oil!!" The legal tax paying residents of CA deserve much better! Vote Brown into HISTORY!

645 2018-03-10 22:15:19 Coconut oil sucks lol im so glad i switched to castor oil
646 2018-03-10 22:15:14 Every curly hair type needs some type of oil! You hair will be dry and brittle I don’t care if it looks good it’s not good. I suggest macadamia nut oil, castor oil, and coconut (sometimes)

649 2018-03-10 22:14:48 That table has a great story. Bought in York in 1962 by a couple who owned it til they died recently, both in their mid-90s. They still had the receipt for it! A family friend who looked after things since they died sold it to me. He works on an oil rig and lives in East Riding.

652 2018-03-10 22:14:42 Heard at #sxsw, “data is the new oil”
653 2018-03-10 22:14:39 Please stay on your side of the Rockies. Dont care what an oil loving American wanna be thinks of me. Not sharing pleasantries. This is a war for my kids future, test me! You will fail ethically, morally, spiritually and ideally. I am not a lemming following others off a cliff
654 2018-03-10 22:14:34 If it was North American oil I wouldn't agree with the tactics but could make a case for consistency. Right now the whole thing screams collusion.
655 2018-03-10 22:14:25 I saw you around Arik some weeks ago. Wanted to call ya but I didn't have your number.
656 2018-03-10 22:14:24 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
657 2018-03-10 22:13:48 Experience uno. For me pellers is the third best coach we've had in this "oil money" era

659 2018-03-10 22:13:34 There is enough holes in the EARTH,and enough OIL in the  Tanks,and enough $$$ in the  poket of the  Oilers.

661 2018-03-10 22:13:20 Reforestation sounds like code for banning oil and gas drilling in areas like Alberta's foothills.
662 2018-03-10 22:13:18 Do Help Afrika and This is right and do not give Europe Oil and Benzin do not Meet them and God told right is This

667 2018-03-10 22:12:35 Palm oil, in most every processed food product on every shelf, anywhere. But with ever-increasing obesity levels crippling #NHS budgets it seems a little counter-productive to be demanding cheap/cheaper supplies of #PalmOil
Whats the story @GOVUK ?
668 2018-03-10 22:12:24 Daily and 3 yrs on I'm as fit as you can get at 62. Coconut oil has Lauric Acid, found in breast milk.. why should it be dangerous?
669 2018-03-10 22:12:21 What does Turkey, Afrin, Hasake, Omar oil fields or the U.S. have to do with kids writing on a school wall anti-Assad slogans in Daraa, South of Syria? Wars are notoriously hard to model or predict once they start
670 2018-03-10 22:12:10 @realDonaldTrump "Keystone Pipeline leaks 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota"
GOOD JOB!!!
671 2018-03-10 22:12:06 It looks like Putin may be getting worried about his America Asset @realDonaldTrump. I think Putin set this meeting up by putting pressure on Kim Jong un. Russia has still been sending oil to North Korea  even though there is an embargo.
672 2018-03-10 22:11:55 10 gallons of oil!!!!
673 2018-03-10 22:11:51 With baby oil?
674 2018-03-10 22:11:49 We avoid palm oil in foods. Grow most of fruit, vegetables and nuts  ourselves (organically) on land we manage and community allotment I run. Palm oil is a major problem, hence why |I as a vegan avoid it. Do you?
675 2018-03-10 22:11:29 @el_cjr pathetic, slow.   if we cant get people to stand up ,call government  reps. make them act on all animal torture extinction, then humans are  lost.  if people could tomorrow walk into store ask manager, ''what palm  oil do you sell  i will put you on YouTube and twitter.''
676 2018-03-10 22:11:16 Nope. I’m still “Vet Poor” & had to buy heating oil again. Spent my tooth money on heating oil.
677 2018-03-10 22:11:14 Wearing gloves so hands don't get too dirty. Take off gloves and wipe hands with an oil soaked rag. Cool.
678 2018-03-10 22:10:58 Some of you Profess to be so oily but your oil is Murky. #Strangefire
679 2018-03-10 22:10:58 Actually I don’t give a rats ass how it gets done or what BC thinks, I just want to see the granola munching Vancouver hypocrites have to pay $5+ per litre for gas made from that nasty Alberta oil they despise so much. 

Then watch them change their tune
680 2018-03-10 22:10:44 In effect we are supporting industry employing ppl for sake of employment. Same time artificially inflating overall GDP of China.

684 2018-03-10 22:10:08 Because this is where Syria’s resources are and where you are bringing up a second state that is an enemy of the legitimate gvt. Syria’s oil in ex ISIS hands rebranded SDF with US air support. Do you expect peace?

692 2018-03-10 22:09:28 I just scared myself so bad tonight. Someone left a light on and the wind rattled the door so I convinced myself we were being robbed. Of course, my dumb self then went out to investigate armed with a spray bottle of tea tree oil.

706 2018-03-10 22:07:15 Ethanol was mandated before we had the oil shale revolution, it's un-needed now and shouldn't have to rely on gov't to survive anymore. Trump will see this and farmers will hate it, but it's just good business.

708 2018-03-10 22:06:52 How’s Libya? Is it a land of milk and honey now that Gaddafi is gone? Any new foreign companies siphoning Libyan oil since Gaddafi was taken out of the picture? Who’s the next 3rd world leader to be killed by Western troops?
709 2018-03-10 22:06:45 Yes. I think the @ilsr score is weighted towards distributed projects at the community / individual scale, and so gives less weight to utility-scale wind. (Iowa has a major wind sector, and they don't score well either.)

To your point, turbine next to oil rig is a thing in Texas
710 2018-03-10 22:06:31 tea tree oil smells so bad

713 2018-03-10 22:05:37 homeowning is so funny. Just stepped into the carport and was just smitten with the beauty of my new oil tank. I mean the old one was easily 50 years old this new one just looks sublimely pristine by contrast.
714 2018-03-10 22:05:28 I know they are doing this weird crime, but why? Is this really about the government supporting oil companies this much? Do they really think we can’t see them?
715 2018-03-10 22:05:16 
716 2018-03-10 22:05:13 THIS is why the ENTIRE East Coast is against off-shore drilling for oil. Lax regulations and no accountability when the inevitable disasters, and even basic leaks, occur.
717 2018-03-10 22:05:11 Please get me some vitamins next time, they’re so expensive. Multi vitamins without iron, fish oil, and D3
718 2018-03-10 22:05:11 That's the oil I like too!!!
719 2018-03-10 22:05:10 People to consume more olive oil have less wrinkles. Aka I’m going to be a plump little tamale forever
720 2018-03-10 22:05:09 senka works fine with my oily skin, gak bikin kering but emang ngurangin minyak. terus itu rajin bersihin muka. saran aku pake micellar aja gitu, pake oil base removernya diganti pake cetaphil heheh
721 2018-03-10 22:05:07 Big Ass Salads for lunch! Lemon and olive oil is the dressing. #Idontliketobehungry!
722 2018-03-10 22:05:02 I mixed cream and tea tree oil under my nose too! I have a huge irritation and I'm trying everything, even if it burns sigh
723 2018-03-10 22:04:52 That’s exactly why I had to give mine up. 250+k miles and an oil leak that would have cost more than the car was worth. It was the car of my 20s, but it was time to go. Guess you’ll have to look into safety ratings and all that for little bean!
724 2018-03-10 22:04:45 @TheAishaJibril It won't be mined they are waiting for 'salary' from Abuja every month end from crude oil sale. MADNESS.
725 2018-03-10 22:04:35 K
726 2018-03-10 22:04:31 And with sweet oil
costly
you anointed yourself

and on a soft bed
delicate
you would let loose your longing
727 2018-03-10 22:04:30 Have you tried coconut oil? It's pretty cheap and works really well. Also Dr. Bronner's Castille Soap is pretty great. I've got a friend who's a landscaper and snow plower in the winter. I'll ask him too :-)
728 2018-03-10 22:04:15 But that girl deserves to do thread na,her condition worse
729 2018-03-10 22:04:12 Oh I been there too. Did you know they still pump out out all over L.A. some buildings that are unmarked are oil pumps inside those buildings. Before L.A. became a mega city, it was oil fields everywhere.
730 2018-03-10 22:04:05 How’s Iraq doing? Have they been liberated from oppression yet? At least Americans and her allies can better control oil prices now that Saddam is out of the picture and foreign companies are running the oil wells.
731 2018-03-10 22:03:49 Well supporters better start showing up if there are so many! Thought lot of oil patch workers collecting unemployment so they do go out and support pipeline!
732 2018-03-10 22:03:34 I guess youre referring to the Strait of Hormuz,or the whole Persion gulf?
You are protecting your oil. 
Also: Noone asked you to, the US just parked ships with a SHITLOAD (i guess thats the technical term) of firepower there.
733 2018-03-10 22:03:30 Agave hash oil with chamomile tea and rose water will feel and taste better than any lean I have or will ever sip in my life
734 2018-03-10 22:03:23 I have a BMW M-3. It’s now 23 years old. Still looks great and runs great. Just get usual oil changes and, except for new AC, that’s been it
735 2018-03-10 22:03:23 #Original sin is removed by the waters of baptism, 
#daily sin by the sacrifice of a mass, 
#forgivable sin by the oil of extreme unction, 
and #other sins by the fires of Purgatory.

That according to the sacramental system of  salvation.
736 2018-03-10 22:03:23 nope
737 2018-03-10 22:03:21 Do you know that adults smoke cigarettes
Deny climate change
Pour oil from their car down the city gutter
Drink Mountain dew and give it to their kids
and keep guns in their houses that increases the probability that their family and self will be shot?

739 2018-03-10 22:02:38 Se puder músicas em inglês sugiro Nina Simone, Donovan, Bob Dylan, midnight oil, Bad Religion... 
Bob Dylan - The Times They Are A-Changin' é emblemática há décadas. 
Do Brasil, Plebe Rude, Karnak e titãs são bandas com músicas falando sobre os temas que tu citou.
Bom trabalho!

746 2018-03-10 22:00:55 My father used to own a Jaguar and it was like $500 just for an oil change!
747 2018-03-10 22:00:48 Chevron Says Climate Change Fallout No Quick Threat to Oil
748 2018-03-10 22:00:33 fun fact: put fake lashes into hot water mixed with a bit of hand soap & oil let them soak in then wash them and you got brand new fake lashes !!!

756 2018-03-10 21:59:39 Man, as time goes on, we're gonna lose all the freaky stories of being a kid in the 50s, when "home remedies" involved swallowing an inordinate amount of oil, vinegar & Vaseline.
757 2018-03-10 21:59:17 Butter/Oil or lotion is SERIOUSLY a MUST after a shower. I don’t know how I used to shower and just put my clothes on when I was younger. I can’t do dry, ashy skin. No, no, no.
758 2018-03-10 21:59:17 Once you use Perk Up by @love_amika, you will never try another dry shampoo again! A super cute bottle of the next best thing to freshly washed hair. Absorbs oil without leaving ANY residue and has amazing fragrance! @sljdavis @LikeUhBoz #NationalDryShampooDay
759 2018-03-10 21:58:59 I fill a tiny spray bottle with an oil cleanser. I can dab it directly onto my face & wipe off or do a double wash with whatever soap is on hand.
760 2018-03-10 21:58:56 People like me? I'm in small business, she& many others helped chase away our big oil companies and it will take a decade to bring them back. I don't know what kind of business you in  but it can't have any relevant connection to the real world, unless it's cannabis or bit coin
761 2018-03-10 21:58:49 2 egg yolks 1/2 avacodo and 1/2 cup olive oil I was kinda grossed out at first but I’ve been using it for about 6 months and my hair had grown almost 6 inches. It’s super healthy now too

763 2018-03-10 21:58:29 I wish I still had some eye dropper bottles cuz I have this amazing holographic mica powder that would be amazing for a shimmer oil
764 2018-03-10 21:57:57 You were told wrong! Almost 30 years later, they are still finding oil along the shores of the Valdez spill. "Oil breaks up over time"?! That is the biggest load of shit! You actually believe this?!? This doesn't even address the impact on wildlife and biodiversity. #stayignorant
765 2018-03-10 21:57:38 My mom is an essential oil enthusiast
766 2018-03-10 21:57:25 Did you know in #opec countries women require husbands permission. This is where much of USA #Oil comes from, when sold to you?  #Cdn Oil Supports #clean Oil laws.
767 2018-03-10 21:56:57 Butter ? More like olive oil
768 2018-03-10 21:56:38 Unfortunatly...governments are shit...  In Brazil...the florests have been rip out without any regret. Cows have been shipped ALIVE to europe..to be killed in Hallal slaugher way.. Big oil companies have received big government money.. Hell
769 2018-03-10 21:56:34 woke up and decided it's a good day to smoke a gram or two of oil and watch some planet earth. We wildin out here.
770 2018-03-10 21:56:28 The best question I got from a student after my #SETC2018 playwriting workshop this morning was about whether or not I use beard oil.
771 2018-03-10 21:56:06 My #Canada buys its #oil on shore, it promotes #women being able to work without having to ask husbands or clergy for permission. #Alberta #oil = #Goldstandard!!
772 2018-03-10 21:56:05 Linda Black Elk from Standing Rock up now. “The oil industry will not stop unto they’ve committed genocide. You cannot get tired. When I feel I’m getting discouraged I will remember you all here, cutting off the head of the black snake.” #kindermorgan #bcpoli #cdnpoli #stopkm
773 2018-03-10 21:56:03 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
774 2018-03-10 21:56:01 With a bullet hole for every lie he's told, #Trump's charred Escalade careens at high speed, chased by cops, jilted girlfriends & wives, the Russian mob, taciturn G-men and Interpol. He's used up his smokescreen, oil slick & thumbtacks & now he fires a minicannon at #California.
775 2018-03-10 21:56:01 I feel like i wanna painting by oil colors but they’re all finished ):
776 2018-03-10 21:55:57 A good first step would be clear labelling of palm oil in all its various forms. It's so widespread it's hard for the average consumer to make an ethical choice. It's deliberately anon or vague in most ingredients listings #PalmOilKills
777 2018-03-10 21:55:56 Is the West satisfied with the wars they have created in Middle East or do they wanna create more wars & drop more bombs. I’m sure they’re happy that Arabs are fighting each other whilst Western companies siphon oil. Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi are rolling in their graves.
778 2018-03-10 21:55:37 nah aberdeen is in it, i just didn't mention it

the Gym there is like this big oil rig and the leader is a Poison-type trainer called Kelvin
779 2018-03-10 21:55:26 He's in it to lift sanctions, get his oil  payoff.
780 2018-03-10 21:55:13 Same thing for me but with stuffed animals
781 2018-03-10 21:55:10 I love food that's like 99% oil and vinegar and sugar and apparently expires a week after you open it.

786 2018-03-10 21:54:50 idk how anyone who drives can call themselves a vegan when gas is made of oil which is made of DEAD ANIMAL REMAINS
787 2018-03-10 21:54:36 My home at the shore is not underwater as Al Gore predicted many years ago. So having lost ALL credibility he is just another ‘snake oil salesman’ to be ignored! #MAGA #AmericaFirst @realDonaldTrump
788 2018-03-10 21:54:31 Like an oil painting. Beautiful edit!
789 2018-03-10 21:54:20 Might do a acrylic painting over break since I didn’t bring my oil paint home
790 2018-03-10 21:54:18 I’m confused on how girls let their friends walk out with mad weave. At least put some oil in it. Comb it ...
791 2018-03-10 21:54:05 هههههههههههههههههه 
792 2018-03-10 21:54:01 @GregaHorvatFX Grega Horvat, what do you think of the future of OIL?
793 2018-03-10 21:53:56 FYI: This tragedy was only 8 years ago. I live in Texas.  I've eaten Gulf Coast oysters twice in the last year  a h& a half. They are quite small. I was afraid to eat them for a LONG time. I order Pacific Ocean fish if it's available.  If you don't know what oil did, check it out

796 2018-03-10 21:53:23 my fave moment from the conference today was when a very angry old water scientist dude said “I don’t know why no one is talking about reparations from the oil companies” and half the room started clapping
797 2018-03-10 21:53:09 So much #luv! #selfaccountability #hmu I've got an essential oil for that!
798 2018-03-10 21:52:55 Didn't Giada make this Rosemary Parmesan olive oil mix for popcorn on her show at one time? #TheKitchen
799 2018-03-10 21:52:49 Tax return came in so I can finally get a black bear from midnight oil
800 2018-03-10 21:52:41 And he BETTER have on the uniform- fur coat and coconut oil 
801 2018-03-10 21:52:37 Anytime I switch my skin care routine I have to dive into this stuff or tea tree oil suitable for skin. But it’s just because I have really bad skin, which I was hoping Halo Beauty would improve . I’m sending prayers for your skin!! 
802 2018-03-10 21:52:16 What’s nitro? Sounds like a oil you put in your car 
803 2018-03-10 21:52:14 Es con fuel oil hoyyyyy, olvidate 
804 2018-03-10 21:51:45 *goes in for an oil change*

mechanic: so it looks like you actual have several problems with your car and if you don’t get them fixed your car is going to blow up and you’re going to die 

me: just change the damn oil, thanks.
805 2018-03-10 21:51:39 Uggh! Feel better. Put some Oregano oil on bottom of your feet and Eucalyptus oil on your chest. B sure to mix with olive oil or coconut oil so it lasts
806 2018-03-10 21:51:38 I like it better than the current destroy the environment clowns but these two would not  get the American people Medicare for all.

We'd still be in oil wars!
We would still go bankrupt if one of our loved ones got sick.
 
Let's focus on 2018
807 2018-03-10 21:50:53 Oil GPT 6+%.  Stop comparing apples to.....
808 2018-03-10 21:50:43 ????? Last I heard R's are against "spoiling" the view by placing wind farms in the ocean. But, think nothing of putting oil rigs out there!
809 2018-03-10 21:50:37 Geez, I guess @NRA gig isn't enough to pay the bills so she's hawking beet flavored snake oil too.
810 2018-03-10 21:50:07 I’m that way with silverware in general. I’ve a,so been known to boil pasta, drain it, toss it in a little bit of olive oil or melted butter then eat it with my fingers...because I’m weird that way.
811 2018-03-10 21:50:04 North Koreans daily income 4$ .....venezuelans basic  income a MONTH  3.75$ in other words 0.124 cents a day ... Amazing the level of poverty in a nation rich on oil
812 2018-03-10 21:49:52 Punkin butt teething oil on amazon works wonders and is all natural!
813 2018-03-10 21:49:46 Note to self:
Remember to get oil change tomorrow!
814 2018-03-10 21:49:13 It's so hard to avoid palm oil, as a consumer.  Nearly every product you pick up in the stores has it in the list of ingredients.
815 2018-03-10 21:48:59 How much essential oil do I smoke on accident? 
816 2018-03-10 21:48:55 Or peel, chop into cubes, olive oil ‘em, and bake @400 for 45.  There’s your salad topping for the week.
817 2018-03-10 21:48:45 QOTD: "Apparently you can use that for massaging oil too but we've never tried that." #brunchtalk
818 2018-03-10 21:48:43 Oh dear, some just can’t see the facts before their eyes, that the SNP are the most divisive Snake Oil sellers in politics today and it going to take a few generations for the damage they have done to Scotland to be anywhere near healed...
819 2018-03-10 21:48:35 I'd  like to be able to buy CBD oil for my dog.
Research has proven it to be very beneficial, but it seems even animals must suffer human ignorance.
820 2018-03-10 21:48:31 To be fair, he looks like a push over, and Bold Films'/Saban Films ' could have a sequel to Shot Caller...what better way to garner interest than if you could base it on a true life story.
821 2018-03-10 21:48:23 Let me know if u think my theory is far fetched. I haven’t really researched the tariff issue until today. I have an article at top of TL re tariffs causing cost of oil production to increase
822 2018-03-10 21:48:18 I use a hair mask with avacado, olive oil and egg yolks. It makes your hair super soft shiny and strong

826 2018-03-10 21:47:43 Alaskans own 844,607 shares of GALP ENERGIA SGPS SA, worth $12,850,145. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in PORTUGAL.
827 2018-03-10 21:47:41 Your point would hold up... if this wasn't about mass exportation of Canadian oil. These tankers are bound for foreign markets. You don't triple output of a product to reduce our reliance on it.
828 2018-03-10 21:47:28 Ah Mike, nothing like supporting American interests. Your hypocrisy is unbearable. Keep supporting American American Oil and Gas Interests, Saudi Oil interests. I can keep going.

832 2018-03-10 21:47:02 Oil & Vinegar based Potato Salad (German-style) w/ onion and chives is THE BEST
833 2018-03-10 21:46:58 Tune in tomorrow night at 8:00 will lead but if good for them keep oil--and that what!
834 2018-03-10 21:46:36 Non sequiter, anyone?  Are they suggesting suicide in lieu of CBD oil to ease pain?  WTF?!?!
835 2018-03-10 21:46:31 1964 to 1970 labour 1979 to 1990 conservative which decade was wrong I was there as well 3.5 million unemployed 17% interest rates. Where did the oil money go?
836 2018-03-10 21:46:27 Perhaps. Proper calculation is increase in price production cost/goods + margin to producer + margin to seller on increased wholesale cost.
837 2018-03-10 21:46:26 NAFLD study:"The omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids consumption was approx. 0.5% E for omega-3 and 4% E for omega-6." That ratio resembles the one in a typical Finnish diet. Lyon used margarine, olive &canola oil (includes n-3 11% and n-6 22%), just like Finnish guidelines recommend
838 2018-03-10 21:46:25 Got my oil changed. The bill says 
“Oil filter disposal fee”
I paid someone to throw something in a garbage. 
Capitalism at its finest
839 2018-03-10 21:46:08 Average annual OPEC crude oil price by year:  1990 US$ 22.26 ... 2000 US$ 27.60 ... 2010 US$ 77.38 ... 2012 US$ 109.45 ... 2014 US$ 96.29 ... 2016 US$ 40.68 ... 2018 US$ 66.85
840 2018-03-10 21:46:05 It’s a seasoning base in Haitian cooking. Green onion, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper, salt, black pepper and or maggi and sazon with a small bit of oil, mashed together in a mortar and pestle. 

Epis is to Haitians what sofrito or recaito is to Latin cooking
841 2018-03-10 21:45:28 You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
Ps 23
842 2018-03-10 21:45:24 My wife is so cool. She lets me clean the guns on the kitchen table and the only thing she said was, “ooo that oil smells good”. 
843 2018-03-10 21:45:23 The #Koch Brothers are also oil tycoons and it seems the steel tariffs will cause the cost of domestic oil production to go up, which may benefit ... Russia. The #Kochs have always wanted the rich to own America; they just didn’t expect to be competing with Putin.
844 2018-03-10 21:45:11 And there is zero evidence of cannabis oil ever curing anyone of cancer.
Hearsay does not count as "evidence".
845 2018-03-10 21:45:02 When the price of oil crashed, given the sheer weight of the industry's footprint in Calgary, the city was hammered. Hammered.

Big time.  No doubt about it.  The government has not "over-regulated" or "taxed to death" these businesses.  I'm busy laughing at #pcpo. Good day.
846 2018-03-10 21:44:41 A project I might wanna do in the future is fixing up that old typewriter with some new ribbon, clean and oil it. I could do that probably on the desk again :P Hope you can still buy those ribbons. Inb4 they are a rare antique nowadays and you get them on ebay for 50€ ;)
847 2018-03-10 21:44:39 Why didn’t he go to Burnaby today to defend the oil industry?

849 2018-03-10 21:44:19 I've got a related #toptip: if you go to the world food aisle in Asda, they do chargrilled, deskinned aubergine in jars - combine with tahini, olive oil & garlic and Bob's your uncle - easy baba ghanoush without the aubergine flame torture
850 2018-03-10 21:44:15 That oil change took way longer than I wanted. Shoutout to my dad for dropping his screw driver in my engine bay 
851 2018-03-10 21:44:07 even more unbelievable is that a 17 year old teenager can be sent off to war and use a gun and either kill or be killed for the benefit of the same warmongers who profit off selling the guns to all sides. evil colonial banker corp gov big oil criminals = war is a racket.
852 2018-03-10 21:44:06 Chlo has made this oil change fly by
853 2018-03-10 21:44:02 Getting my oil changed and one of the mechanics walks in and asks if I’m wearing lotion. I tell him yeah and he says “you smell good af. You just brightened my day!” Uh, okay?

867 2018-03-10 21:42:04 @DelaineEastin has made her position clear from the start.

"find a funding source, before it becomes a train to no-where for no-one" -- she suggested a tax on oil extraction
868 2018-03-10 21:42:02 So ...Let's counter it.
We don't want USA to drill for more oil, do we ?
More expensive oil will make green resources less expensive.
Trump & Russia are doing a good thing !

Let's start 'Go Fund Me's for green energy projects, that Obama wanted to lead the world.
-> Best for USA
869 2018-03-10 21:41:59 Looting of Nagaland to resume under the same old hands. A close watch on oil extraction policy is a must, since all resources there belong to Naga tribals according to the law.
870 2018-03-10 21:41:55 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
871 2018-03-10 21:41:55 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
872 2018-03-10 21:41:49 Do you think any fossil fuel was uses to make you phone?

Should we try for less reliance? Sure.   Meanwhile use Canadian oil.  It will save all the exhaust from the Venezuela ships.
873 2018-03-10 21:41:49 The Oil Industry has paid lobbyists, advertisers, twitter posters, gov't influence and deeper pockets, all foreign Oil company $ I dont see you complaining about that!

881 2018-03-10 21:40:50 Yes you nuked them cause you are murderous people, but not only that, you are stealing oil from other nations, so you are murderers and thief. BTW 911 was an inside job.
882 2018-03-10 21:40:35 Oil imports were half the trade deficit last decade . . .

884 2018-03-10 21:40:31 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
885 2018-03-10 21:40:27 That is not true. The West Coast has supply issues that are leaving us with gas pric spikes and Washington and California importing oil by rail which is much riskier
886 2018-03-10 21:40:19 this spurt of motivation I’ve had to get shit done is nice! oil changed, new windshield wipers and new trimming in the bathroom done in one weekend. hoping to get my license changed this week and my next target is getting my shower doors painted & put in!
887 2018-03-10 21:40:15 With oil on its arse, you would think they would embrace the opportunities an English parl would present. 
An Eng parl, Eng brexit and England out of the rebranded celt union.

889 2018-03-10 21:40:11 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
890 2018-03-10 21:40:11 Mf sun come out. Everybody out & about. I been waiting for this oil change for like 30 mins
891 2018-03-10 21:40:05 Whoever finally addresses this travesty has my vote.
892 2018-03-10 21:40:04 I'd be okay if the Oil just kept trading all my favourite players to 1 specific team out east. Load up NJ, make it easy for me to keep cheering for someone come april.
893 2018-03-10 21:39:58 Happy birthday! I just got my first order of shampoo, conditioner, and oil and I love it!!!

897 2018-03-10 21:39:19 The NRA does not give two shits what Canada's gun laws are. Good lord.  Americans messing with Canada are the ones who make cash off of mining and oil. The stricter gun control in Canada the easier for the US to invade if needed.
898 2018-03-10 21:39:07 We send more money to Mexico than they get from oil sales in EIC for kids that don't live in our country.
899 2018-03-10 21:39:02 But na small money I go pay
900 2018-03-10 21:38:54 Speaking of pipelines, Marsha Blackburn voted:

@PhilBredesen founded a solar company & supports renewable energy &  heating assistance 

#LIHEAP #SolarEnergy
901 2018-03-10 21:38:40 No it didn't. And look what happened when Carter removed the price controls which Nixon put in place. A sudden supposed oil shortage, which was nothing more than the petroleum companies gouging the hell out of the people. There was no oil shortage. That was greed, pure & simple.
902 2018-03-10 21:38:17 I did have the oil and water checked. But there was a prob with the rad recently. I need to get to the garage Monday. I know my poor old motor is on her last legs.

918 2018-03-10 21:36:18 The caliber of these people is not even in the same ballpark.

921 2018-03-10 21:35:36 Increase of 6 cents per six pack, adding 5% margin to that hardly amounts to $2
922 2018-03-10 21:35:32 Tahini is the weirdest thing I have ever cooked with. It's a non-Newtonian fluid with eldritch properties. It started off as runny as oil and with a bit of whisking it turned into cement.
923 2018-03-10 21:35:10 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
924 2018-03-10 21:34:48 When fossil fuels are eventually more expensive than cleaner sources of energy, the resources pouring into them will make them comparatively cheaper than oil ever was. Distant future, but it'll happen. Once energy cost isn't a huge concern, enter the transportation drones.
925 2018-03-10 21:34:38 After each horrific gun massacre, the NRA pours more oil on the waters. Why? It serves their marketing purpose...sales of guns go up.

931 2018-03-10 21:34:09 A potent poisonous mix of xenophobia & dogma combined with the snake oil selling of simplistic cure all solutions led the hard Brexit brigade down this wilfully blind alley.

963 2018-03-10 21:29:40 The epitome of a ruthless, hypocritical, parasitic charlatan. 

Unfortunately there are still enough fools to buy his snake oil, which keeps him going.

988 2018-03-10 21:24:24 You've been buttering your bread with Scotland's oil for years.
989 2018-03-10 21:24:12 That coconut oil for your skin/olive lol for your hair wave is undefeated out here
990 2018-03-10 21:24:05 Oil me up and shut me down
991 2018-03-10 21:23:47 It's seems to me Exxon are the oil company with the most integrity. They did the research, they didn't go along with the obvious scam. The rest are pretty sickening and would jump on any bandwagon to line their pockets.
992 2018-03-10 21:23:28 I like the original in the orange container and olive oil Ima try Castor oil

997 2018-03-10 21:22:03 #BeautyTip #CoconutOilBenefits : Coconut oil as a conditioner. You can add unrefined coconut oil straight from the jar to your in-shower hair care routine, but you may want to look out for a conditioner that lists it as an ingredient to avoid weighing down your strands. #CPRSales
998 2018-03-10 21:21:59 Sucks went to get oil change and they couldn't do it, they said I have an oil leak. I just took it to a garage and now they say I have an oil leak and antifreeze leak  Keep my finger  that they don't find anything else wrong with it.

1006 2018-03-10 21:21:19 #BeautyTip #CoconutOilBenefits : Coconut oil as a frizz-tamer. The jarred stuff is also an excellent styling agent. Use it to tame frizz by adding a small amount to the ends of your hair. #CPRSales #DIY #beauty #skincare #haircare #makeup #bbloggers #personalcare #spa #skin
1007 2018-03-10 21:21:08 Ima have to try that one cause I hate the coconut oil one
1008 2018-03-10 21:20:37 He’s not there as SOS. He’s there to lobby to deregulate oil biz & create heretofore unimaginable ways to exploit resources from our planet.
1009 2018-03-10 21:20:18 Question: Is 15-40 considered essential or non-essential oil? #bossbabe
1010 2018-03-10 21:20:14 You also had a song called Johnny football bro and you aren't the person to tell anyone what to do. Oil money must be nice. Money manziel

Simply apply it before bed and wash it out in the morning for a more intense treatment. Doing this will give you the "maximum benefits" of coconut oil #CPRSales #beauty #skin #hair #personalcare #DIY

1017 2018-03-10 21:18:32 Hemp, Canvas was an original polymer but it wasn't developed because you can grow it anywhere...  They don't want that, you have to buy it from us from our oil well.

Water is bottled to compartmentalise it, and because you'll buy from 1000mile away if it is a funny shape 
1018 2018-03-10 21:18:27 Data is frequently compared to oil, which suggest a privatizable commodity. Instead, it's better compared to time - which used to be fragmented and "owned" by railroads but we can't even imagine a world without public and transparent timekeeping.
1019 2018-03-10 21:18:18 This woman getting her oil changed has a sticker that reads, “White-ish Montana” wrapped around a snowflake. I need an opportunity to ask what it means
1020 2018-03-10 21:18:12 #BeautyTip #CoconutOilBenefits : Coconut oil as a pre-wash treatment.

1021 2018-03-10 21:18:06 OK.
1022 2018-03-10 21:17:50 I'm getting an oil change since I bought a Groupon for one for like $24. They keep up-selling shit. I know my pos car needs a lot. It is a 2000 Durango, duh. 

Also, you stay in the car the whole time. So, they can't make fun of you while you're out of earshot. That's not fair.
1023 2018-03-10 21:17:42 @350canada are nothing more than dishonest and self righteous Facists ignoring Canadian law to the benefit of US and foreign oil producers at expense of Canadian economy and sovereignty.
1024 2018-03-10 21:17:38 This is way too much responsibility for me. I wanted to legally drink and vote, not possibly maim myself via coconut oil soaked QTip

They’ve shown us their priorities by continuing to vote over &over again for oil&gas companies.

1131 2018-03-10 21:00:49 Make many sales of your snake oil??
1132 2018-03-10 21:00:47 As a colourblind man, it looks amazing to me.  I draw, I paint, I do lots with colour. My parents just told me to do it. Although my partner did ask me why I was doing a self portrait with green skin. He labels all my oil pastels and paints for me now.

1135 2018-03-10 21:00:29 This is not new - was known many years ago that coconut oil is fairly benign concerning LDL-C.  But good to see they confirmed research from 60 years ago
1136 2018-03-10 20:59:51 Expecting to get berated by the Jiffy Lube guys for going too long between oil changes carries with it a particular sense of dread
1137 2018-03-10 20:59:50 I'm still holding my longs until 66.66. I'll reassess and accumulate more to my longs under 59.78, I'll re-evaluate if we drop under 57.48. My outlook is still bullish/hold on oil and metals.

1147 2018-03-10 20:58:30 43 per cent of mining jobs went in the 1960s under Wilson, 80 per cent were lost under Thatcher. Unem was consid higher through the 1980s than the 60s, and the affects were not so great. She had billions of £s oil rev and wasted it on cutting taxes instead of infrastructure.

1156 2018-03-10 20:56:52 We have projects on the shelf to do this. But the relative prices of oil and sugar don’t make it economic. And we don’t see enough premium for biodegradable. But that may change...
1157 2018-03-10 20:56:48 買うなら今かOlive Oilの作品。

1160 2018-03-10 20:56:20 It makes it drier and crunchier! I did it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. I seasoned with olive oil, turmeric, hot paprika, and chile flakes (same seasonings going in the thing I'm cooking later)

1165 2018-03-10 20:55:27 Changed the oil in the cars, watched UK get a dub, and @Tpancake22 is coming tonight. Today's shaping up to be a baller day
1166 2018-03-10 20:55:24 And it not just shell saying this, every oil producer has projected the peak.

1176 2018-03-10 20:53:35 I think Putin will negotiate peace after the Islamists are defeated. He'll drop Assad, push Iran out, and install a proxy so he can grab oil contracts. Trump wants to keep the yellow Kurdish bits + oil. Erdogan wants the North West for Turkey

1183 2018-03-10 20:52:16 I have no fucking idea how soldiers/oil workers/traveling jobs can stay away from their wives and families for so long without going ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.
1184 2018-03-10 20:52:09 1, Big money comes from oil, weapons, drugs, healthcare, etc. They spend some of it on politicians, in exchange they hardly get regulated.

1201 2018-03-10 20:50:06 recent buzz that much of the imported stuff was fake....mostly rapeseed oil with a splash of olive for flavor. That would make a big difference!   I switched to California grown US produced olive oil from my food coop...but I eat much more bacon fat & butter than olive oil.
1202 2018-03-10 20:49:51 They're so good... I drizzle them with oil and lemon juice, then add a lil garlic, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and cumin and toss em in the oven. if only my parents had seasoned anything ever :/ I hated them as a kid

1274 2018-03-10 20:39:53 Crocodile oil is a great moisturizer and gets rid of acne and blemishes. Black soap for exfoliating three times a week & Aloe Vera facials once a week work well too.
1275 2018-03-10 20:39:49 I'm confused.

I always thought this worked to US advantage?

Example buying oil they only had to worry about oil price in USD rising
If changed then they could get double hit if the US dollar is weak compared to gold

Would Gold standard mean dumping central banks, or unrelated?

1278 2018-03-10 20:39:04 JANE-IHILATION was good. Gina Rodriguez is so terrific, the standout in a mega qualified cast. Music great, visuals lovely (another movie that owes Tobe Hooper a debt of gratitude - it has his oil slick colour pallet). Subtle in the right places.
1279 2018-03-10 20:39:01 But my sister can go like 6 months without a oil change
1280 2018-03-10 20:38:53 i just got baby oil on my uggs  and these my favorite pairrrrr!
1281 2018-03-10 20:38:48 Oil has done more for the advancement of mankind and HEALTH of the planet than all of your virtue signaling combined.
1282 2018-03-10 20:38:43 I’m getting quite good at oily cock massages  maybe I should start doing a service?  anyone fancy one?  M #oil #cock #massage
1283 2018-03-10 20:38:39 Sounds like a no-brainer to go that route, but everything in ship design is a matter of trade offs. Previous hybrids ( coal/oil, diesel/steam ) have been hampered by complex bunkerage issues .
1284 2018-03-10 20:38:37 Gym session 
Healthy rice based meal 
Bath run 
Beard oil 
Moisturiser 
My idea of a cracking Saturday evening!
1285 2018-03-10 20:38:24 Take (once a day) 1500mg vit C with a zinc tablet ..... and a oregano oil capsule - you’ll be ok in no time...! All available at Holland & Barratt or a health food shop
1286 2018-03-10 20:38:16 *Every auto person I ever talk to in life* “wow ur car has a lot of miles....”

No shit can’t you see I’m running it to the ground? provide the oil change pls and thank you 
1287 2018-03-10 20:38:04 Why Do Oil Changes Cost So Much 
1288 2018-03-10 20:38:03 I'm glad we're up the with the leaders in oil production. We're not doing big gulf wars now. We probably do oil safer. And prices should come down further I hope.
1289 2018-03-10 20:37:38 good,well there’s something else I could use to help rub in that oil
1290 2018-03-10 20:37:36 where can i get castor oil from
1291 2018-03-10 20:37:35 I’m beginning to that olive oil is not doing any real service to what we’re talking about as well. Thoughts ?
1292 2018-03-10 20:37:32 His agenda is oil. Every decision he makes is to further this agenda. Should we be surprised that he lies about an energy source that threatens oil?
1293 2018-03-10 20:36:53 There is a sucker (fool) born every minute! P.T. Barnum  On full display on the streets of Burnaby! It is really hard to believe that there are so many dummies around! No oil and gas = no life!
1294 2018-03-10 20:36:47 Wait till you get to Australia the chocolate has oil in so it doesn’t melt & it’s rank 
1295 2018-03-10 20:36:47 The world is awash in plastic killing us all, and your promoting plastic flowers? Strange brand of activism.
1296 2018-03-10 20:36:45 BC will find a way even if Alberta shuts off oil flow
1297 2018-03-10 20:36:37 I need to get an oil change
1298 2018-03-10 20:36:34 Danish oil
1299 2018-03-10 20:36:21 Can’t remember the @ of the auntie that sells beard oil in Abuja. 
1300 2018-03-10 20:36:14 Decades of Scottish/British oil wealth pissed away by successive Westminster governments. To whom? More public wealth stolen by the 5%, by the 'establishment'. Where has the money gone? Boris Johnson can't say where the garden bridge £46Million went, what about the oil £Billions?
1301 2018-03-10 20:36:10 Also thinking of reviewing CBD oil
1302 2018-03-10 20:36:05 ... when you inevitably fill a pot with oil to do this and then realize you have so much leftover you need to fry more things...

Don’t fry a pop tart. I speak from fire-alarm-blaring experience.
1303 2018-03-10 20:35:53 My new car now has new breaks, new rotors, new calipers, New air filter, fresh oil 
1304 2018-03-10 20:35:49 how was I paying 80$ for an oil change lol good year got me for the low this the plug
1305 2018-03-10 20:35:48 I remember the oil crisis and gas rationing of the 1970's.  I remember all of my relatives being kind of shocked since "rationing" hadn't happened since WWII.
1306 2018-03-10 20:35:14 I ran out of vape oil! 
1307 2018-03-10 20:35:00 Don’t you realize the benifits that our Oilsands have been for  All of Canada.  India wants Oil and Canada has more than enough to supply Canada and export to other countries.  The $$$ loss for Canada has been ridiculous because we can’t export.
1308 2018-03-10 20:34:43 @realDonaldTrump Re: Keystone pipeline -In April 2016, there was a 400-barrel release -- or 16,800 gallons -- with the majority of the oil cleanup completed in two months, Walsh said. About 5,000 barrels of oil spilled Thursday.
1309 2018-03-10 20:34:42 Please respect your automobile and only use full synthetic motor oil
1310 2018-03-10 20:34:38 My BF made it through back surgery recovery on cannabis oil we made into capsules with appropriate dosage.. he got some opioid meds but only used 10 pills in 60 days.. left two refills unused.. I was amazed how well it worked.. and I'm an activist..
1311 2018-03-10 20:34:31 I FOUND MY TRUE IDENTITY THANKS TO THE EGGSLS I DISCOVERED WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT OIL AND WIRES  #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY @BTS_twt
1312 2018-03-10 20:34:21 Have u tried applying castor oil to your scalp??? It worked wonders in my case
1313 2018-03-10 20:34:14 use grammarly maybe it will help you? We don't pay $1.57 a litre fuel, we approve oil pipelines to help build jobs #BC #Ab
1314 2018-03-10 20:33:57 Charcoal peel off masks take away all and any dirt and oil from your skin (mix activated charcoal with non toxic glue)
1315 2018-03-10 20:33:56 When they spray eucalyptus oil in the steam rooms at the Russian spa. 
1316 2018-03-10 20:33:54 Don't be inbearist The Koch Brothers have been working on this decades! Now they enlisted Putin & other Oil & billionaires to their party! They now own outright the Republican Party! Now they all must go! @tommytomtracy
1317 2018-03-10 20:33:50 Maybe this is the push we need to focus more on green energy and rely less on oil
1318 2018-03-10 20:33:40 Because I can’t act right on the oil 
1319 2018-03-10 20:33:33 Wendell! You touch that painting and I'll kill u where u stand! John Ross this is Ewing Oil, not some building. -1987
1320 2018-03-10 20:33:33 Would you like a hand rubbing the baby oil in!!
1321 2018-03-10 20:32:57 Hi Deepanjan. Yes it is an oil painting. And I thank you again for your encouragement. Wishing you all the best too.
1322 2018-03-10 20:32:53 Redirect our scientific community to instead study and develop artificial photosynthesis to make “green” hydrocarbons. Plant oils are ubiquitous! Olive oil is the ancient elixir of life, oft mentioned in the Bible - old and new testiment. Olive oil is produced daily worldwide.
1323 2018-03-10 20:32:48 Not quite tar oil in the toilet and waking up in your sisters jammies
1324 2018-03-10 20:32:47 and yet they still back the dolor against the OIL Reserves Why because the world has plenty of it and much easer to steel than gold
1325 2018-03-10 20:32:45 Self evident. No explaination needed.
1326 2018-03-10 20:32:41 Have you ever changed the oil?
1327 2018-03-10 20:32:36 If John McCain was in office over Obama, think about all the oil we’d have
1328 2018-03-10 20:32:34 Interesting, in the 7+ years since my diagnosis my doctors have had a few suggestions but not one, in 2 countries and 4 states have suggested hemp oil or mj, legal in 3 of the states. I guess my death won’t matter, there’s always another Pt to take my place.
1329 2018-03-10 20:32:30 Oil my nigga. What makes them delicious. You wouldn't want a 100% poh-ta-to crisp. As Walkers Sun Crisps show time and time again.
1330 2018-03-10 20:32:23 o.O wow cool. I once met a customer at taco bell who did oil pipleline inspections, but he traveled the world doing it and I was just like "What is that like for him? Like I'm just one more guy at a random TBell in another city"
1331 2018-03-10 20:32:09 you’d think after splattering hot oil on my stomach enough times i’d learn to stop cooking shirtless but here we are
1332 2018-03-10 20:32:08 Coconut oil
1333 2018-03-10 20:32:03 He’s given up any pretense that he cares one bit about what happened at Parkland.
1334 2018-03-10 20:32:01 The US has worked hard to develop the offshore oil resouces in 1980s, then the Shale revolution & now in offshore wind electricity very soon USA will be no1. Hats off to US scientists, engineers & hard working technicians for enabling US citizen living a comfortable life.
1335 2018-03-10 20:31:44 he found me out :(
i'm MELTING.  Thanks, oil companies!
1336 2018-03-10 20:31:12 Deal with Russia Billions lost if sanctions remain. OIL EXXON

1339 2018-03-10 20:30:52 @devonxxx I can’t stop thinking about you and baby oil  Sexiest Woman I’ve Ever Seen Dream Luv 
1340 2018-03-10 20:30:43 Not all football teams can be owned by corrupt oil rich countries. Some have to find other ways to grow the club.
1341 2018-03-10 20:30:26 Please shut the valves Ms. Notley. They don't want your oil.
1342 2018-03-10 20:30:23 My bestie just told me lemon oil helps get rid of dye—-if you have some, I think you’ve said you’re in the middle of nowhere.
1343 2018-03-10 20:30:05 It needs to happen! Not embarrassment, that’s been established already. The argument. The bash over the head of the deniers not realizing their being manipulated only for the interest of oil industry who cares only about $$. Way more jobs in clean energy & US is being left behind
1344 2018-03-10 20:29:46 Even if this turns out to be the oil cooler ( £100 part ) it's going to be around 6-8 hundos for labour. I'll let you know the quote Monday. And loaded? I fucking wish. Pink lint mate 
1345 2018-03-10 20:29:42 does bio oil help with acne scars?? i just ordered it online
1346 2018-03-10 20:29:40 my momma i was having a convo then she just stops & says "let me pray for you" then pulled out some oil and put it on my forehead & idk how to feel rn
1347 2018-03-10 20:29:37 2 hour wait for a  oil change at Wal-Mart. Wow. "Mind as well" (@mar1087 ) get some lunch! – bij Wendy's
1348 2018-03-10 20:29:35 Might have to watch Oil City Confidential again now
1349 2018-03-10 20:29:31 @realDonaldTrump If Virtual Soviet Union comprised of the regimes of Putin Iran Hezbollah ISIS Qaeda J-Nura Muslim Brhod Wikileaks & other terrorist orgs is able 2 erase Sunnis from Iraq Syria zen gates of Arabia are opened & Pute will have monopoly on oil (so much 4 USA to lose)
1350 2018-03-10 20:29:24 The leader is leaking oil
1351 2018-03-10 20:29:23 A nigga I work with really clocked in and came back 3 hours later meanwhile I’ve worked on 13 cars he still on doing an oil change on the same fucking truck
1352 2018-03-10 20:29:22 We have to put coconut oil on my grandpa Head sometimes
1353 2018-03-10 20:29:15 Also coconut oil is a saturated fat. It’s not a “good” fat. Just because it’s natural, doesn’t mean your body can recognize that. Your body still just sees a saturated fat which is not good.
1354 2018-03-10 20:28:56 North Korea is in need of Heating oil its people are cold and hungry Kim Jung Un knows a French Revolution is coming if he doesn't help his people reason he has come to the table is his country is dying and NK's leader knows it.
1355 2018-03-10 20:28:37 I do hope they/you are right. Your team are a lot of fun to watch and I want you to take down City with their oil money and their own subsidised former athletics stadium!
1356 2018-03-10 20:28:28 I have seen peppermint oil used. Maybe it works because it's dissolved in alcohol.
1357 2018-03-10 20:28:25 Karachi: F.B Area Samanabad Mein Dacoiti Muzahimat Pr Firing Se Oil Depot Ka Maalik Janbahaq, Awaam Ka Gulberg Chowrangi Pr Ehtijaj
1358 2018-03-10 20:28:09 Ah mine is neither, its oil central
1359 2018-03-10 20:27:54 The tweet that set you off included a link to a webinar to explain CBD status and the text suggested the confusion has “opened the door to snake oil salesmen” based on your reaction can only assume you are one. Or a shill for one.
1360 2018-03-10 20:27:50 im so fucking annoyed with my mom she took my car for hrs and i had an oil change appointment 30min ago and todays the only day i can do it ugh im PISSED DNEKEKSM and i have work in two hrs
1361 2018-03-10 20:27:47 Went to jiffy lube for an oil change(20,000 km over due) got roasted the entire time I was there about how poorly I take care of my car 
1362 2018-03-10 20:27:29 "Mmm... Fuck... Gettin' tired.

Whelp. I guess a nap is in order~ Which means I get to test that oil!*
1363 2018-03-10 20:27:27 So disappointing.. When denied heating oil from the oligarchs.  His father Joe stood up to the both parties by going to Citgo for Oil & received it. US Oil btched but did nothing. His company Citizen's Energy supplied winter heating oil for ten's of thousands in the North East.
1364 2018-03-10 20:26:41 re: Oil Pulling.  Disgusting Hoax or the Real Deal?
1365 2018-03-10 20:26:30 gun manufacturers don't care about deaths as long as they make $ pharmaceutical companies don't care about the opioid epidemic  $ oil companies don't care about the environment  $ agricultural companies don't care about the affects of pesticides $ so who cares about the people?
1366 2018-03-10 20:26:28 I fucking hate aquaphor cuz it’s so thick & it peels my tats.. the jojoba oil with keep it moisturized and make the tattoo heal better TRUST ME
1367 2018-03-10 20:26:18 Boosting EXXON oil stock prices along the way.
1368 2018-03-10 20:26:04 #Petro ICO is an oxymoron paradox. A socialist govt using an extreme tool of #capitalism to raise $ for a corrupt system by promising lay people huge returns on something that has NIL value, backed by physical oil reserves where the #token has no physical form @maxkeiser wetdream
1369 2018-03-10 20:25:52 I lost my coconut oil
1370 2018-03-10 20:25:36 We won’t stop pumping oil in the Gulf until years after all sea life in the Gulf has been extinguished. The oil industry and its lackeys in Congress will then be tried for Crimes Against Humanity.
1371 2018-03-10 20:25:22 Sooooo randomly got 200 more dollars in my account, got a 20$ off coupon on my oil change from a cute old lady, and found out I don't got to pay gas this whole trip... Seriously, God is so goood
1372 2018-03-10 20:25:12 just bought an essential oil AND a diffuser somebody save me from myself
1373 2018-03-10 20:25:03 Lush tea tree oil and magaminty face mask have actually improved my skin so muc wtf
1374 2018-03-10 20:25:00 Yes.  Drill for oil in the grand canyon. jobs, jobs, jobs
1375 2018-03-10 20:24:57 Bingo. Lack of refinement is Canada's biggest but least talked about Achilles heel.We would be completely self reliant and our reserves would ensure Canadian's pay significantly less, and consequently not at the mercy of US refineries who buy our oil at a basement bargain price.
1376 2018-03-10 20:24:54 Omo that's my next wave, mixing lemon oil and almond oil nightly
1377 2018-03-10 20:24:53 Recommendations for beard oil?
1378 2018-03-10 20:24:43 Don’t use aquaphor or lubriderm, go to sprouts or Whole Foods and get JoJoba oil and it’ll heal your tattoo within a week
1379 2018-03-10 20:24:38 If you didn't use cooking oil as body lotion, you don't know the struggle...
1380 2018-03-10 20:23:48 O.o bolts for Diapers?! Is that the oil pan?
1381 2018-03-10 20:23:41 I'm slathered in leave in conditioner and olive oil. If I can't get it undone by tonight I'll buy detangler tomorrow.
1382 2018-03-10 20:23:37  vitamin e oil be working miracles  thank you baby
1383 2018-03-10 20:23:26 It's not the oil companies, it's the f**ing government with their nonsense taxes!!!!!!

1387 2018-03-10 20:22:19 heck of a lot easier to clean than a tanker spill. now you guys get back to your oil sands, we'll get back to our pristine beaches and mountains. tah-tah.
1388 2018-03-10 20:22:17 so I went to get a oil change and them dick heads took my gum.
1389 2018-03-10 20:22:11 They need to be more concerned abt his and his buddy putin’s plans for their oil
1390 2018-03-10 20:22:03 Alfie Kohn likens homework to cod liver oil, asking why teachers and parents continue to administer it in absence of any proven benefits.
1391 2018-03-10 20:22:02 Re: Trump & NK meeting - Putin is still sending supplies to NK. Putin is also looking for a way to unlock oil drilling deal with Rex T. Putin helps with NK for Trump to remove sanctions. That's how I see it from here. All about 
1392 2018-03-10 20:21:55 Not really feeling this new oil .. My burner has to be on low
1393 2018-03-10 20:21:45 drži, je. Definicija: "process of extracting chemical compounds or flavors from plant material in a solvent such as water, oil or alcohol." Čaj je vedno poparek, poparek pa ni nujno čaj, ker to, da je nekaj čaj, je potrebno izpolniti določene predpostavke 1/2
1394 2018-03-10 20:21:42 All of these right wing weidos have some kind of snake oil they are selling.
1395 2018-03-10 20:21:39 So interesting to see all the signs, clothes, boots, pipes for sign handles, cell phones, public address systems, and motor vehicles that brought them there. All byproducts of the oil industry they desperately protest against.
1396 2018-03-10 20:21:24 Nice quiet rainy day in the shop. TIme to build them CV AXLES with our Lucas Oil G3 Racing grease
1397 2018-03-10 20:21:14 Christine Elliott says "we need to look at innovation".

Yet she wants to eliminate green policy.  I wonder what innovation is in store for the world to innovate themselves off of oil dependence.

#PCLeadership debate.
1398 2018-03-10 20:21:07 We got #KushFamilyOriginals in.
BEST OIL IN THE STATE. COME SEE WHAT THE HYPE IS ABOUT. 
1399 2018-03-10 20:21:04 My dad has been taking fish oil pills since the 90's. He's going to be heart broken to hear.
1400 2018-03-10 20:21:02 " palm oil soup" water, palm oil, knorr, nutmeg, cinammon and salt & extras
EPIC FAIL
1401 2018-03-10 20:20:59 make a habit of using castor oil on your lashes & brows before bed and watch how your life changes
1402 2018-03-10 20:20:48 You bet most don't even live in BC, funny how everything NG they are wearing and using have oil products in it,
1403 2018-03-10 20:20:37 India wants to import oil.  A perfect situation for Canada but of course we can’t ship it to them so they will buy from other counties.
1404 2018-03-10 20:20:29 No ones mad were legalizing cannabis all pretty happy. While your president terrorizes his people daily our is a free spirit fancy sock wearing feminist. The @CCHempMill crafts hemp oil from locally grown hemp and doesn’t export outside of southern Alberta. Why so threatened?
1405 2018-03-10 20:20:23 there's like, differing opinions on if coconut oil is okay to use with silicone toys tho
1406 2018-03-10 20:20:10 When enterprises use "collaboration and creativity" or governments use "patriotism"…
You should work creatively (die) for your (our) company (country (corrupted government)) soldier (piece of meat)! You're protecting our citizens (we need a war there (no it's just about oil)).
1407 2018-03-10 20:19:54 This ICO is an oxymoron paradox. A socialist government using the most extreme tool of capitalism to raise $ for a corrupt system by promising lay people huge returns on something that has no value, backed by physical oil reserves where the token not even exist in physical form.
1408 2018-03-10 20:19:49 I wish oil blotting sheets were much bigger
1409 2018-03-10 20:19:48 Y’all, her next birthday, I’m giving her pamphlets/links to sex toys and a jar of pure coconut oil. It’s important
1410 2018-03-10 20:19:47 You & a whole lot of others would be profoundly shocked with what a week without oil would look like.
1411 2018-03-10 20:19:38 We're in the interval now, everyone's getting an idea of his diet. 'I have a handful of nuts. Now, you have to be careful. Buy the big bags because the smaller ones are a swizz. But a handful of nuts and two tins of mackeral. Not the ones in sunflower oil, they do nothing for me'
1412 2018-03-10 20:19:37 Sesame oil is great for lubing up.
1413 2018-03-10 20:19:30 I would love to WIN for Yvonne Martin....b-OIL-utiful skin  #FreebieFriday
1414 2018-03-10 20:19:30 I was thinking, that's almost as much as subsidies to oil companies, but they're kind of the same thing.
1415 2018-03-10 20:19:16 tip: apply a thin layer of coconut oil or vaseline before putting on highlight
1416 2018-03-10 20:19:14 The essential oil smells hide the weed smell in my car lol
1417 2018-03-10 20:19:01 So much for th old saying, “Oil’s well that ends well.”
1418 2018-03-10 20:18:58 Agreed! It would be great to see renewable energy companies devise strategies to attract oil workers, offering jobs. Humans' fossil fuel addiction is near-killing our only viable home, earth. Now is the time for clean energy, but jobs strategy is key.
1419 2018-03-10 20:18:43 Getting my car’s oil changed like a GROWN UP,,,,,,,,I maybe be 3 months late and a good 10,000 miles over the recommended check up BUT STILL
1420 2018-03-10 20:18:31 UK govt is after Saudi Arabia money and their oil and careless on any human rights abuses going on in Yemen. #you are a disgrace prime minister Teresa May.
1421 2018-03-10 20:18:25 Nah it’s not crazy, one of my mutual with fibromyalgia relies a lot on alternative medicine and some of that essential oil stuff really does have at least some sort of factual beneficial properties
1422 2018-03-10 20:18:24 They should be marching naked, no cell phones, hats, sunglasses etc. if they really are anti oil! Hypocritical dumbells of the highest order! When they have to pay double for gas and oil they might get it!

1426 2018-03-10 20:17:53 Its an outrage that this pristine national wildlife preserve and home to caribou hers may be opened to oil and gas drilling. it is not something to be proud of.
1427 2018-03-10 20:17:34 I need to do a hot oil treatment... fuck am I waiting on 
1428 2018-03-10 20:17:20 @realmikecolter did they spray you with oil before every one of your shots in “Jessica jones” or are you naturally that gloriously shiny <3
1429 2018-03-10 20:17:11 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1430 2018-03-10 20:17:01 My thoughts exactly. And all these years in the booth you don’t think Grudog hasn’t been burning the midn oil for a return. Thank God Chucky is back....
1431 2018-03-10 20:16:58 If oil running through a pipe can eat a hole in it, you got a problem.

1433 2018-03-10 20:16:50 You ain’t talking nothing slick to a can of oil .
1434 2018-03-10 20:16:40 So stupid, you fight CDN exports and do nothing to stop Saudi oil coming to Canada.  And stop spewing your sewage into the Ocean... oh yeah, no more barges of gasoline to the Island )this is your biggest risk) ... be consistent with your so called principles”.

1439 2018-03-10 20:15:28 Y’all. This juice infused lip oil from @ultabeauty is just.... omg. I can’t deal. My lips.. soft as hell. 
1440 2018-03-10 20:15:26 Aseem, there’s also no evidence that saturated fat helps. The only foods which have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of heart disease are fruits, vegetables, nuts, extra virgin olive oil/rapeseed oil and oily fish. Why are you encouraging people to eat butter?
1441 2018-03-10 20:15:23 If Obasanjo is a sincere sympathiser he has to pay similar visits to Odi(Rivers State) where he wiped an entire village because of their oil.And Umulolo Okigwe(Imo State) where he gunned down 88 members of MASSOB.And to Gen.Victor Malu(fmr COAS)whom he exhumed his father's grave.

1444 2018-03-10 20:14:51 Well were not giving them ,food , oil, or billions of dollars  ! Like past presidents , over and over again ....
1445 2018-03-10 20:14:28 Korean Steel pipe. 
Brand new facility 2 leaks within 2 yrs due to thin wall in 3" pipe. Pretty common problem, but it's cheap.
1446 2018-03-10 20:14:27 Says the moron riding a DIESEL POWERED FERRY TO AN OIL PROTEST.  You are ridiculous.
1447 2018-03-10 20:14:14 BC doesn’t want our oil so Alberta threatened to cut them off, believe thats part of the issue here. But yeah, funny how gas prices in Sask reflect prices seen across the country, such as in Hamilton when its refined within the province. It makes no difference.
1448 2018-03-10 20:14:05 I never have known love but as a kiss

1457 2018-03-10 20:12:34 To be fair shouldn’t you be protesting unethical countries that ship oil to Canada.  Or why not in the Strait of Hormuz..
1458 2018-03-10 20:12:29 Those pesky pesky sanctions. And oil drilling rights.
1459 2018-03-10 20:11:56 Go back to what started this exercise. I said Alberta put all its eggs in the oil basket. You said private sector better at deciding where to put eggs. This argument is just demonstrating that public & private sector are entwined in this.
1460 2018-03-10 20:11:34 Yeah, I live in Chicago. I know. I love my Great Lakes. Now read about the underwater  old (still in use) oil pipeline near the Mackinac Bridge. And the moron the EPA appointed for the GL region.
1461 2018-03-10 20:11:30 So we need to goad Rachel Notley into stopping oil through the existing Alberta pipeline. If she does that and if she has the legal right to do that then we have the legal right to stop the Kinder Morgan pipeline forever. The best possible proof .@jjhorgan is within BC’s rights.
1462 2018-03-10 20:11:17 Did you know that CBD oil doesn't have to be expensive?
1463 2018-03-10 20:11:16 Sounds tempting but i need a good ass job lol. Might take my ass to the oil rigs

1467 2018-03-10 20:10:11 Fact: Omega-3 fish oil capsules reduced my triglycerides, which had been high for years, to normal levels. Did a controlled experiment and - yes - they were what did it.
1468 2018-03-10 20:10:09 Yeah they say the use oil based products before  or after on open pores is what causes the break out so use witch hazel or aloe.

1488 2018-03-10 20:07:48 No, the rivers that oil gets dumped in are collectively owned. I would suggest we privatize rivers, lakes, streams, and also the ocean
1489 2018-03-10 20:07:23 I’m surprised everyone didn’t see this from day one. Remember when he was just plain MIA forever?? He’s reeked of oil and money from the get go. Pun definitely intended.

We WILL get our ressources to tide water and if B.C. obstruct we will shut the current tap of oil going to BC. 2-3$/L after that in BC!
1500 2018-03-10 20:06:08 I don't know but if you've ever been hunting through an oil field you know there's nothing live there anyway and if you shoot your weapon you might cause a fire. And when they frack. forces gases into the water table which causes people to turn on their faucets and get flames

1506 2018-03-10 20:04:54 Read the article, a different CBD oil bill likely to pass, extra one being changed into lifetime free gun registration & take your gun to church bill. Indiana churches must be a scary place to visit- my take home point.

1515 2018-03-10 20:03:18 Because Norway is one of the world’s largest oil producering countries, the Norwegian krone NOK tends to trade as a petro-cutrency, similar to CAD. It strengthens as oil prices rise and vice versa.

1555 2018-03-10 19:56:19 Do you guys put the terpenes back in to your oil pens?
1556 2018-03-10 19:56:19 I need to lay on the beach with pizza and chili oil  by my side. 
1557 2018-03-10 19:56:09 lol good try oil companies. "truth in politics"
1558 2018-03-10 19:55:35 CNN: "Keystone Pipeline leaks 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota". This is why Real President Obama refused to authorize the pipeline!
1559 2018-03-10 19:55:24 Im crying oil tysm love q.q
1560 2018-03-10 19:55:16 If you think any of those descriptors is inaccurate, I encourage you to do some research on what all is in the bitumen that you would like to ship through BC forests and waters.  And by its nature, once oil is spilled nature , it is virtually impossible to clean it up.
1561 2018-03-10 19:55:06 Everytime (all two of them) I ride in an Uber pool I quickly remember why I pay that oil extra to be TF alone. This bitch talking on the phone saying she tired of everyone naming their baby Amir and not everyone looks like an Amir. Bitch your name is Xykeria SHUT TF UP.
1562 2018-03-10 19:55:05 I hate coming to this oil change place they always trying to get you to spend more money than you suppose to spend

1564 2018-03-10 19:54:41 Lead us from temptation, make us royalty. All the things we're facing', make us question it. Lead us to salvation, put that oil, please. That's how we'll become kings and queens.
1565 2018-03-10 19:54:39 Remind me how blocking a pipeline cuts global oil demand. Tell me how perpetuating status quo of shipping AB oil by rail, & by pipe to the Koch brothers, is better for climate. Tell me how we build on #ClimateAction by kneecapping our most climate-progressive leaders. #cdnpoli
1566 2018-03-10 19:54:35 I take a C-3PO style oil bath every night to ward that off, so I'm hoping I'll adjust well when the time comes.
1567 2018-03-10 19:54:30 I have the oil I just been oss because how now after 7 long months they just popping up!!
1568 2018-03-10 19:54:30 The protesters drive to the protest and sit in kayaks made of oil. That tells me even the radicals don’t have a viable alternative. If oil is consumed, make it Canadian oil.
1569 2018-03-10 19:53:31 Wendy's has the oiliest burgers. They suck. When I got home and opened the tinfoil wrap, my hands were literally soaked in oil.
1570 2018-03-10 19:53:26 I’m getting an oil change and he told me to pop my hood but I popped my gas tank open.
1571 2018-03-10 19:53:24 Unpopular opinion but absolutely hate neckin pints of olive oil
1572 2018-03-10 19:53:20 Take your fake ones off with oil rub it into them and let them peel off by them selves don’t rip em off and use castor oil for growth
1573 2018-03-10 19:53:13 You may lose 15 more but gain 1500...and would it kill you to use more oil?
1574 2018-03-10 19:53:12 I have made my own lip butter with beeswax, Shea butter, coconut oil, castor oil, and a few essential oils.  Works fantastic.
1575 2018-03-10 19:53:03 Top challenge is corrupt judges, prosecutors, IAS, IRS, PCS, IFS, journalists etc. @narendramodi need to hang these guys.
1576 2018-03-10 19:52:25 Like the oil from the movie lorenzo's oil?
1577 2018-03-10 19:52:17 Thank you love! Do I just buy a jug of virgin coconut oil and slab it on while I’m showering or do they sell them as hair masks?
1578 2018-03-10 19:52:13 Our roads are a mess because our politicians are getting plowed by Oil/GAS, Car & Insurance companies...and every other special interest that believes private cars should be how we get around!! Did I mention traffic & parking fines, etc...NO Practical way to Logan by Pub Trans!
1579 2018-03-10 19:52:11 Not to forget that the Kansas-based billionaire alt-right Koch Brothers are major players in Alberta oil and gas. One reason, I am sure, why Alberta gets far less than other oil-producing states for its resources.   #stopKM
1580 2018-03-10 19:52:05 These are the same personalities that show up on your doorstep unwanted to tell you how their religion is superior to yours and the only 'true' religion, they're just in different bodies hawking different snake oil.
1581 2018-03-10 19:51:51 I need to get my pocket trumpet out, oil the valves and start practising The Last Post for my next gig in Raglan.
1582 2018-03-10 19:51:40 The guy at the nail salon said that the oil they use is a Chinese potion to make black people’s ash go away 
1583 2018-03-10 19:51:38 I don rub anointing oil for my television. 
1584 2018-03-10 19:51:14 I knew all those curb checks were going to come a bite me on the butt eventually. Hello, oil leak~
1585 2018-03-10 19:51:03 WHEN YOU FACE SICKNESS

14 Are any among you sick? They should send for the church elders, who will pray for them and rub olive oil on them in the name of the Lord. 15 This prayer made in faith will heal the sick; the Lord will restore them to health, and the sins...James5:14-15
1586 2018-03-10 19:51:02 I’ve been high for like 3 days off this sour diesel oil. #VapesBro
1587 2018-03-10 19:50:40 Coconut oil hair masks! Leave it in for 20-30 min before the shower and not only does it makes you hair grow, it also improves your scalp health, adds volume and shine 
1588 2018-03-10 19:50:35 What. An. Idiot. They think we don't see they're just shills for the dirty coal and oil industries?

1590 2018-03-10 19:50:29 so apparently i have an oil leak in my car that leaked oil into all kinds of hoses and coolant reservoir and radiator and shit.

1591 2018-03-10 19:50:09 Lugged out 8 patio chairs & long table ready to oil them as per instructions. Got my lint free cloths. Got my wood oil. Got my protective clothing. Could not get top off can of oil. Hate #DIY.
1592 2018-03-10 19:50:05 @realDonaldTrump Please substitute Olive Oil and Coconut oil in all that you eat and have prepared.  This will make a life and death difference in health! Coconut Oil is "Anti-Microbial (anti-microbes/germs) and just keeping it moving around in the mouth and between Teeth is GR8
1593 2018-03-10 19:50:04 Because Putin put him in the job, it's not done yet.  I always ask myself why would he take on this job?  Well that oil deal he had with Putin got spoiled by sanctions.
1594 2018-03-10 19:49:32 Really? Taking away healthcare, women’s reproductive rights, land from our precious national parks, raising the price to visit these beautiful places.  Opening up our beautiful coastlines so that the old school oil industry can drill again. 1/
1595 2018-03-10 19:49:23 Reports from financial sector do not report substantial wage growth or permanent job growth; and oil markets and wall street are bouncing all over like cats on acid because of the manipulation by this administration.
1596 2018-03-10 19:49:01 It's a truly beautiful painting, I loved the brush strokes, the imagination behind the subject . Probably it's oil painting, I usually do poster colors and oil pastels.

1598 2018-03-10 19:48:40 When you have a discussion in your local kebab takeaway on the merits or otherwise of the Galatasaay vs Fenherbache rivalry. You realise football is bigger than EPL money grabbing snake oil salesmen

1601 2018-03-10 19:48:27 I am specifically citing what it says in the constitution about immigration and national security and who has the reigning vote and responsibility... I don’t think the epa or oil is in the constitution...
1602 2018-03-10 19:48:18 Try Olive oil or Africa's best
1603 2018-03-10 19:48:18 It's a strawberry shake. They're not allowed to call it a milk-shake. Some sort of edible oil and chemical stew.
1604 2018-03-10 19:48:04 Oh no! And wonderful cafe run by ex @scarthinbooks staff up in hill - is that still there?
1605 2018-03-10 19:48:03 Tell oil companies you may set up under Republican administration but the Democratic’s tear down oil platforms and can’t wait to get them.
1606 2018-03-10 19:47:57 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
1607 2018-03-10 19:47:55 They gon try to run his name in the mud or kill him. Oil not a billion dollar industry, it's a trillion dollar industry. They want him dead
1608 2018-03-10 19:47:36 For example, using your example of auto plants: they can and do make vehicles powered by methods other than oil; they will continue this adaptation and gas-powered cars will be phased out.
1609 2018-03-10 19:47:27 #OilMoneyOut #PeoplePowerIn  I just submitted a comment to Culver City Draft EIR that would allow the city to extend their portion of the Inglewood Oil Field by 30 new oil wells. Tell Culver City Officials: No New Oil Wells In Culver City! Submit your comment here: ht

1611 2018-03-10 19:47:24 DEMs spent last 35 years embracing GOP causes: Wall St rule, War, Union busting, racist policing, criminalizIng the poor, & bailing out banks & oil corps.

1616 2018-03-10 19:46:42 I totally agree no offshore oil drilling allowed on the Calif. Coast.
1617 2018-03-10 19:46:32 What a beautiful cold day! Going to try and hit a trail today and just be with nature and kids. And a little bit of oil.
1618 2018-03-10 19:46:29 So the existing pipeline that has transported dilbit for 60 years already. But now all of a sudden it’s impending disaster. Does BC bank the oil tankers from Alaska as they wave to you on their way by to Washington.
1619 2018-03-10 19:46:13 The national security argument is just dumb. Just like oil and gas, since these resources aren't nationalized, domestic production is sold to whoever in the world pays the most. Those arguments are just a front to cover for the govt making policies that only benefit corporations

1626 2018-03-10 19:45:30 Did KFC start a trend where companies run out of the one product they sell? The usually efficient folks at VIOC in Ann Arbor are out of oil filters for 4-5 days.
1627 2018-03-10 19:45:27 Norway isn’t even the population of the Bay Area. And they are a top 20 oil exporter. They are rich.
1628 2018-03-10 19:45:26 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1629 2018-03-10 19:45:20 Exactly right. When we remove the oil and auto maker lobby from Washington, a renewable fuel might have a more level playing field that would not require an RFS.
1630 2018-03-10 19:45:15 PS - I'm a former oil & gas contract analyst from Calgary who worked at AEC/EnCana and CNRL!!
1631 2018-03-10 19:44:55 Alberta's out-dated refusal to see what's coming and adapt is a problem that it needs to address ASAP. The world is changing and the oil basket is not a good place to keep one's eggs.

1639 2018-03-10 19:44:16 ALSO STOP LABELING OILS AS SERUMS UGH. a serum should normally go on BEFORE your moisturizer and an oil AFTER. LABELING AN OIL AS A SERUM IS VERY CONFLICTING. FUCK YOU.

1647 2018-03-10 19:42:59 I'm impressed it's never been welded! Helluva find. 

Mine was once dark green but the previous owner's wife decided she didn't like that so they had it painted white in '81 or so. It also got a brand-new engine in '88 when the local MB dealer didn't tighten the oil drain plug.

The Emirates have been splattered with cake on their faces and are running -450$million on a fake deal they've signed 

All that oil and not a single smart guy..

Is there such thing as an Emirati anyways?

1696 2018-03-10 19:36:54 Yes,jobs are increasing as FuckFace trump dumps all environmental regs to promote business.More jobs in exchange for unbreathable air, toxic land dumps & oil spills in the ocean is NOT A WIN.

1700 2018-03-10 19:36:40 You’ll need a box of cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup oil, and if you’re using yellow cake, a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix it all in a bowl and spoon the dough on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes on 350. You can ice them when they’re cool if you want

1711 2018-03-10 19:34:42 Air popped, no butter, they’re totally fine, super low cal, even with a bit of sugar. So yeah, go for it. Even the buttered kind or oil popped isn’t horrendously calorific but obviously without is better.
1712 2018-03-10 19:34:35 @SocializedG What chance does an honest, well meaning PSU Oil Company officer have? Few years ago an officer working for India's largest PSU lost his life tackling the adulteration mafia
1713 2018-03-10 19:34:20 @JohnRHarrell @JeffRabjohns Any chance, assuming NA makes the state finals, that they move it to Lucas Oil? I think they'd easily sell out BLF.

1720 2018-03-10 19:33:01 We also need to become independent of Saudi oil and return the UN to Western hands or we will have no choice. Terrible powers are allied against us.

1722 2018-03-10 19:32:45 Electricity is a secondary energy source. You need to use primary energy sources such as coal. oil, gas, water, sun, etc to generate electricity. The private sector need high prices to get a return on their investment! State electricity companies have been an absolute failure!

1729 2018-03-10 19:31:54 It spreads like purée once cooked. You can drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt for flavor.
1730 2018-03-10 19:31:50 @PnPCBC Mike Harris is sounding more and more like snake oil. His beliefs in private sector over all else is shuddering.
1731 2018-03-10 19:31:40 It’s about arms manufacturers profit margin so it makes dollars and cents for them. Don’t be blind to the corpratocracy that is America Ms. N. Try reading @economic_hitman for starters. See what happens when politicians oppose the oil depletion allowances for follow up

1735 2018-03-10 19:31:24 Ok- I IF on M-F and don't eat until 10:30-Noon. My coffee has MCT oil, grass fed butter, powdered collagen, and Lions Mane in it. Is th collagen interfering with the intermittent fasting since it has protein in it? I have DD, so that's why I added it.
1736 2018-03-10 19:31:08 So if (petro)  is not backed by oil,  then it is simply same as any other crypto currency like bitcoin, or?

1739 2018-03-10 19:30:34 Yes - I consider U.S.A. energy independence to include Canada - simply because we work so closely with Canadian drillers - quality partners - structure - also love the Athabaskan oil fields - this resource has the most exciting reserves and we are catching on fast how to extract

1744 2018-03-10 19:30:00 Very "low info" comment. Existing TMP typically over-subscribed between 60% - 70% monthly. IOW refined products compete with various oil grades for access. Hell, Burnaby refinery went to NEB to have guaranteed access to no avail. Now ship in via 110-unit BNSF oil tanker trains.
1745 2018-03-10 19:29:49 Put bit of Vicks on a piece of newspaper and burn it ..... It may work as Vicks has Mint, Eucalyptus oil in it, it troubles mosquitos.... Good Luck

1771 2018-03-10 19:27:24 Good use of Wikipedia there mike, unfortunately EVs have to be charged using fossil fuels to generated the electricity. Unless you believe food has a higher calorific value than coal or oil, EVs aren't as CO2 efficient as a person on a bike

1830 2018-03-10 19:19:53 Yes is was certainly safe then and also nutritious.. largely because our ancestors knew how to grow the crop and extract the oil. Modern day methods are tainted. The seeds & crops  are probably GM & riddled with pesticides.  Find a reputable source...

1833 2018-03-10 19:19:35 Why are we arguing about something that's almost obsolete. Nobody sees #oil backed anything is dying? How long do you guys think economies/countries or whatever, will continue to rely on oil?
1834 2018-03-10 19:19:35 Tambrahms are very clever! They never involve directly! Beggars indirectly create violence between two castes and enjoy! Without caste violence Brahminism will be wiped out of southern states! So they keep add oil to caste based hatereds! Saffron Dalit does not know anything
1835 2018-03-10 19:19:30 My sainted mother taught me that. :-). By the way, her vinaigrette is vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, Dijon mustard, and a slice of fresh onion to taste. (A garlic clove might be nice.) Even better when allowed to sit a day.
1836 2018-03-10 19:19:04 Ahh mate that’s the fucking worst - steam and eucalyptus oil will help between sudafed et al  feel better
1837 2018-03-10 19:18:50 I absolutely agree with you, Kari. I'm also astute enough to realise that oil and water never mix, and somethings can never be no matter how much we will or want them.. 
1838 2018-03-10 19:18:32 I find tea tree oil works really well but most people don't just have that around like toothpaste. Vinegar is amazing for so many things.

1930 2018-03-10 19:06:19 Correct.  US can print USD for critical imports.  If China becomes 2nd nation able to settle oil in own currency (CNY), how many of the USD's making up FX reserves of 26% of GDP will it need going forward?

1990 2018-03-10 18:59:51 USD is not an oil derivative. I am not interested in debating concept of currency backing (I've written thousands of words on that topic), nor "derivative". USD isn't oil derived, oil backed, etc.

The US govt enjoy an exorbitant privilege? Yes, but that is not the same question.

1997 2018-03-10 18:59:25 I also tried tea tree oil and it didn't work, the soap also smells but its better. You don't have to use tea tree just find a soap that isn't drying. Do you have oily skin?
1998 2018-03-10 18:59:16 Yeah she drizzles olive oil and sea salt on them and roasts them. They taste like manure.

2009 2018-03-10 18:57:35 I am punjabi & they apparently used a type of mustard oil - sarson oil extracted from a type of mustard seeds apparently for generations too. Is that safe? Trend has been the old generation were right!

2017 2018-03-10 18:56:28 Wuuii the flavour eve coconut oil gives your food is truly maddening 
2018 2018-03-10 18:56:23 Anytime! There’s a lot of snake oil out there but ol’ Dorothy is made of much stronger compounds
2019 2018-03-10 18:56:10 It is startling sometimes just how impaired they are.
2020 2018-03-10 18:56:08 Oil change .. clean a little ... need to go to gym
2021 2018-03-10 18:55:52 Yup. My 66yr old retired kindergarten teacher mother uses CBD oil for her arthritis. She's not ripping bong hits for Christ's sake. Sessions represents true ignorance.

2026 2018-03-10 18:54:56 I recommend to wash your hands, dry them then put a layer of coconut oil and massage your face with it gently! Then wet your face with a little bit of warm water, at this point put a little bit a soap in your hands and RUB IT IN YOUR HANDS so that the cleansing is more gentle!!
2027 2018-03-10 18:54:52 Would happily reclaim her kitchen window web. We never broke her original web so she only ever patched it up but one day fumes leaked from our oil fired cooker & it took her over a month to be able to spin a decent repair after it happened :)
2028 2018-03-10 18:54:49 The US is the most corrupt country in the world. The lobbyists system legitimizes bribing by allowing the corrupt to get bills passed in their favor. The bribes by the arms, pharma, oil & auto industries is no match for any other country in pure dollar terms.
2029 2018-03-10 18:54:48 I need my oil changed.....uhhhh
2030 2018-03-10 18:54:43 What is wrong with wanting to do something about citizens United? It was backed the top 2 Democratic presidential candidates in 2016
2031 2018-03-10 18:54:26 Better reporting would have included how many barrels of oil the US and Canada use per day right next to how many these pipelines would 'produce'
2032 2018-03-10 18:54:24 Took my car to the shop this morning for an oil change and all the mechanic wanted to talk about was all his complaints with @metrolosangeles. What’s that they say about journalists getting story ideas everywhere?
2033 2018-03-10 18:54:22 Free oil changes and lawn care! Sign me up!!!
If you are referring to government programs, that tax dollars go towards, then get the GOP to engage in a conversation on welfare reform.

2063 2018-03-10 18:50:24 Because ExxonRex is trying to drop sanctions on Russia so Exxon can use their oil drilling rights that they already paid $500 billion for but can’t use with sanctions in place. Ever wonder why he left CEO job at Exxon to work for Don? It’s the quid pro quo for Putie!
2064 2018-03-10 18:50:23 How much oil changes cost?

2073 2018-03-10 18:48:49 "Pay me $1000 and I will teach you how to make $10000  per month on automated mode."said the digital age snake oil salesman 
2074 2018-03-10 18:48:40 Questions remain: who is going to pay for it and where is the CO2 going to go? Current demand is 80 MTpa, and this would have to increase ~1000x by 2050 to 80 GTpa. Recall that current oil production is 5 GTpa.
2075 2018-03-10 18:48:38 Progression of narrative:

2095 2018-03-10 18:46:14 If immigration policy is to be “federal and at the discretion of the president”, do you say same of Sheriff Arpaio’s actions  as rationalized  by the next president? Of red states rights in suing EPA in 2016 over oil? Btw, you can skip the numb nuts stuff. It’s kind of childish.
2096 2018-03-10 18:46:09 There's a lot of dog shampoo with tea tree oil in it, as it helps yeasty skin and repels fleas. It is probably toxic to eat, 100% concentrated tea tree oil. But in shampoo its highly diluted and safe.

2110 2018-03-10 18:44:34 Richer no way, Norway has a lot of oil and they know what to do with it. I agree with you, I also see the argument used here. We cannot affort that as Norway does... I think Chile should try harder!
2111 2018-03-10 18:44:33 In my experience a lot of oil is required
2112 2018-03-10 18:44:31 It's like my village people have decided to visit today..how can oil finish in the gen 15mins into having a haircut ehn. 
2113 2018-03-10 18:44:16 We are butter-lite (just need a tiny bit) but if you are zero-butter, then I'd probably not do the taco seasoning either.  
BTW:  For zero butter days, I sometimes use coconut oil.  So good.
2114 2018-03-10 18:44:14 - chewing, I spoke. "I'd still like to see you working. It's pretty hot when you're wearing those coveralls with oil or whatever all over you." I winked at him and ate a couple of fries. "How often are you working these days?"
2115 2018-03-10 18:44:14 That’s it. We need to stop lighting it on fire . There is enough plastic in existence to recycle into new plastics, but we will need some oil for medicine and lenses and etc.
2116 2018-03-10 18:44:07 I’ve already decided to go electric.  Big Oil.
2117 2018-03-10 18:43:48 yeah, those low oil prices are just horrible things.....
2118 2018-03-10 18:43:46 Understand completely. My father has dementia now from be checked in the face with a chain while working an oil rig in Oklahoma. My name is Derek..... bc of his line of work when I was born.

2124 2018-03-10 18:43:31 The small entrepreneurs hire helpless jobseekers & use them without pay, same way the bigger firms absolve youth corps members & get almost-free services refreshed every 7months, paid for with oil rents.

2146 2018-03-10 18:41:41 Funny how people think a pipeline protest is as one-dimensional as “ridding life of all oil”.  People protest for energy diversity, for the right to make better energy choices, for the government to focus on sustainable research and development... many, many reasons to protest.

And oil will flood the sea.
2185 2018-03-10 18:36:15 The only problem this pipeline solves is getting tarsands (yes I use that term meaningfully) oil out of the ground and into the atmosphere faster than the climate can absorb. Keep selling buggy whips, Blair.
2186 2018-03-10 18:36:15 The mountain of gold is not oil it is water you can't drink oil
2187 2018-03-10 18:36:09 In terms of moisture I stay away from anything too heavy. So shea butter and coconut oil avoid it just weighs my hair down.

2274 2018-03-10 18:25:50 In that 16 years no bailout was paid, in between oil was selling at an all time high...you don't expect PDP to borrow what it didn't need. 
Don't even compare two failures, failure is failure whether it is covered with an umbrella or swept under carpet with a broom.

2278 2018-03-10 18:25:28 She finished off what mass manufacturing industry we had and wasted the oil revenues, you can think whatever you like but they are the facts. I remember 15% mortgage rates under a conservative government and mass unemployment

2288 2018-03-10 18:24:39 Preening is an important skill that albie chicks learn very young.  Adult birds preen to clean themselves, realign  feathers & transfer oil from the preen gland at the base of their tail to their feathers making them waterproof
2289 2018-03-10 18:24:33 Thank you son for using up all of my face oil cleanser while I was asleep. Toddlers are evil. You thought them being infants was hard?

2292 2018-03-10 18:24:05 You can only join USA. That is your only hope. But to just go it alone AB is doomed. The oil is not needed for the rest of Canada. It was a nice to have...but not needed enough that AB can think they have any leverage at all.
2293 2018-03-10 18:23:55 i have to take my car to get an oil change and i hate doing it bc what if they find something else wrong with the car!?

2298 2018-03-10 18:23:15 LMAO new essential oil stuff  not that exciting to people but I’m so excited 
2299 2018-03-10 18:23:06 Some people consider oil to be an engine lubricant but I like to think of it more as an engine lubrican.
2300 2018-03-10 18:22:57 My castor oil came today brows and lashes gone be lit !
2301 2018-03-10 18:22:50 And of course people will pass it off like, "oh of course you got sick eating all that FAT" but like, no, I can eat half a block of butter and feel fine, it's the oil that's fucked up.

2305 2018-03-10 18:21:32 I did this Wednesday and had to sign a waiver saying they taught me how to check my oil bc of how dangerous it is wooooops
2306 2018-03-10 18:21:28 Queer thing. I've been stealing my girlfriend's Oil of Olay, but my balls still look like a Shar Pei puppy.
2307 2018-03-10 18:21:28 Like I feel like I’ve seen wayyyy to many variations of the same concept. An extremely curvy black woman drenched in baby oil with a very muted background. Typical 
2308 2018-03-10 18:21:27 Soooo...is this oil money going to go to pay off our national debt, pay back Social Security, and get us insurance?   I bet that they have other plans with what to do with the money the make by stealing OUR natural resources 
2309 2018-03-10 18:21:07 I got some argan oil for my damaged hair y’all
2310 2018-03-10 18:21:03 Yes but the pattern was already set from low prices and people still needed to get to work etc. All I’m saying is we won’t wean ourselves off oil if we keep doing things to make it cheaper.

2312 2018-03-10 18:20:52 Agreed not there yet, huge quickening in process will be CNY oil contract under which CNY is convertible.  Will massively accelerate this process.  Multi-currency oil/commodity pricing in context of scale of twin deficits of incumbent reserve ccy (USD) means it won't take long
2313 2018-03-10 18:20:50 those are different than & additional to the Obama sanctions, which are the Crimea, Ukraine ones & they are being enforced still since Exxon cannot move forward with the RU-Arctic oil drilling plans. Congress needs to impeach .45 to get the new sanctions enforced.

2322 2018-03-10 18:19:13 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

2354 2018-03-10 18:15:03 Also, one manufacturer may use fresh canola oil, another may use rancid canola oil. There's no real standard for the "freshness" of oil.

And canola oil sensitivity, especially when it's rancid, is way more common that celiac.

2364 2018-03-10 18:13:48 In order to actually be "losing $20 Million a day in oil revenue" world oil prices would have to be significantly higher. The UCP and CPC seem to think that the world price of oil is tied to which party is in government.

2374 2018-03-10 18:12:52 Wow. So the only reason people would oppose a dangerous polluting pipeline is Russian influence? Let's consider the possibility that people not owned by the oil industry have a different opinion from those who are.
2375 2018-03-10 18:12:50 Without incident?  Look up your history. Burnaby already had an oil spill, we just had two other fuel spills in the last year, and don’t forget the Exxon Valdez!  #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

2380 2018-03-10 18:11:18 my advice tho is get a good skin care routine and stick w it (tea tree oil works wonders on cysts) and as much as u might wanna cover it up w makeup, don’t. it was super embarrassing at first but letting my skin breathe helped so much! and don’t let anyone bring ya down bc of it.

2392 2018-03-10 18:09:49 That is the strategy move the paid traumatised ptsd lost the plot mercenaries along, to next theatre of action until 'their' strategic goals are met. Destruction of ME and all people starving broken and on their knees. Much easier to steal/suck oil, gas, water, minerals &gold
2393 2018-03-10 18:09:38 Oil is still in demand - its way too simple to blame it all on the price of oil. Other economies also rely on oil & it hasnt dented them... Look at Saudi Arabia, finding another £10 bilion for fighters...
Difference is, Saudi didnt borrow ridiculous unsustainable amounts...
2394 2018-03-10 18:09:36 Thatcher did nothing but give tax breaks and squander the North Sea oil revenues on unemployment
2395 2018-03-10 18:09:35 If it's being an ideologue to want to end homelessness & foodbank use, stop selling arms to despots, stop involvement in needless oil wars, stop multinationals avoiding tax & a fully functioning public sector then I'll have that please
2396 2018-03-10 18:09:33 No country can be at peace without giving in to the Empire. Every country that has tried controlling their own oil and money supply has been destroyed by the Empire, unless they have nuclear weapons. Everyone I know says NK is playing a game and will not give up nukes.
2397 2018-03-10 18:09:29 Remember 1945 !! Like what happened ? Some how Texas oil ran out. Developers with Nikola Tesla free energy technology had no deal against oil. International Illuminati running things since with no charges against making Hitler and the Nazis after developing Tesla technology.

2406 2018-03-10 18:08:26 Alberta has had port access via terminals for a 150 years via rail and road. Think . How have goods come in and out of AB this whole time. You fly oil out? Use ur head
2407 2018-03-10 18:08:25 Live without oil then. Just try it. You will be naked and freezing.
2408 2018-03-10 18:08:25 During the global energy shortage which you predicted, do you foresee some countries (Europeans/Japanese) drilling for oil in Antarctica?
2409 2018-03-10 18:08:18 Limiting BC oil from us. After a while they will get their oil elsewhere. Permanently. We will lose business. You are not thinking of the bigger picture. Nor past your ego. @RachelNotley

2413 2018-03-10 18:07:52 Wasn't the gov using oil as its main source of income for the country? It's a variable rate commodity, not a stead source to base an entire economy on, or large portions of it anyways, unless you are very wealthy to begin with and can suffer the downturns in price.

2415 2018-03-10 18:07:46 The outdoor industry generates plenty of $$, creates employment, health & joy. But those in the oil/mining industry aren't getting much of the profit.What I see?

I can wait.
2432 2018-03-10 18:03:14 And if look at the dynamics of stocks since begining of February (total of oil+gasoline+disel) it would be inline with 2017 nonetheless much lesser net import
2433 2018-03-10 18:02:44 I don’t know how to answer your questions! If you check my tweets, my family is TEXAS & LOUISIANA! BIGLY Oil & Gas! If I can be totally honest, we’ve seen BIG benefits even before Trump was ‘Officially’ in office! So, that’s the explanation for 
And does THAT answer the?
2434 2018-03-10 18:02:13 Not at all what happened. But he’s muted me again I suspect, so that he can straw man me in peace. Y’all are right about the snake oil. I would never presume to criticize fields I didn’t first explore, and I’d be willing to defend those criticisms with reason.
2435 2018-03-10 18:02:07 Rubbish.  It was a political calculation.  @JustinTrudeau couldnt approve energy east because he needs votes in Quebec.  Now he wants to make it up to oil companies & Alberta and he's willing to sacrifice BC.

2446 2018-03-10 18:01:03 Just get the Liquitex Grey Gesso from Michael’s. Cover your mini in it. It dries on perfectly. Then use Citadel Nuln Oil wash on it straight from the bottle making sure it pools in the crevices and shadow areas. That’s it.

2452 2018-03-10 18:00:27 I don't often lose my composure, but when you forget to put the cap back on the engine of my car after you change the oil, you get what's coming to you. I'm lucky I checked.
2453 2018-03-10 18:00:27 Not all hate America. Many held memorials after 9/11 to honor the victims. Many young Iranians are now secular.

Why do you think they hate America? Did you know we toppled their government in the 50s and put up a puppet dictator so they we could get their oil?
2454 2018-03-10 18:00:17 @jjhorgan this pipeline doesn’t need to be built. People before profit. Logic before oil and gas propaganda. Why put BC jobs, that rely on a clean cost, at risk? For only 50 long term pipeline jobs. There needs to be long term thinking here Not thinking for only an election cycle
2455 2018-03-10 18:00:16 Thank you but I’m just hoping my oil burner doesn’t break down completely and leaves use with no heat or hot water before this extremely important part arrives hopefully Tuesday

2463 2018-03-10 17:58:51 The mistake AB makes is thinking there oil is needed. Its not. It requires heavy dilution via import light sweet for refining to fuel otherwise its roofing tar. AB would destroy itself without any port access. 1 way in out for goods U be best to join USA as a state. Alone ur done
2464 2018-03-10 17:58:48 Seriously these guys need to understand that the pipeline is a way to secure the future for our next generation. The pipeline is a more viable option to move our crude. It will help generate prosperity for citizens of BC & Alberta.Pipelines are safer way to ship oil then rail.
2465 2018-03-10 17:58:46 That uses lots of oil.

2468 2018-03-10 17:58:38 You’re so right. I get so many emails from people who have developed reactions to coconut oil. It’s one of those “totally natural but tread lightly” products.
2469 2018-03-10 17:58:13 Natural lol I use bentonite clay (it’s extremely messy) to wash.

2475 2018-03-10 17:57:27 BS. Snake oil. They’re just out to make a quick buck off of upper-middle class women who think this is healthier than actual medication reviewed and approved by the FDA.
2476 2018-03-10 17:57:25 About that. Spent a while in the UAE. Yes. They have lots of cheap oil.  So there a few yank cars here...but..  not as many as Japanese, Korean and others.

2493 2018-03-10 17:56:16 This remind me of peak oil story
It was the end of the resource until fraking and now they have no place to store it...

Be careful with future predictions ...
2494 2018-03-10 17:56:10 Well that's not a very intelligent answer for someone in charge. If he ran his oil company and was bleeding staff he'd care.

2499 2018-03-10 17:55:02 How? AB being landlocked will loose large. need to beg USA to buy the bitumen at even more reduced cost. And truck it all down. Alberta does not supply gasoline to canada outside of jet & diesel. Oil is imported to east coast refineries for gasoline and refined gas from usa.

2526 2018-03-10 17:52:06 @maplewoodlexus is 2 hours standard procedure for a oil change? This is ridiculous
2527 2018-03-10 17:51:45 Like energy/oil, this shouldn’t come as a shock. To put the US in a position that it has to outsource the very basics of national defense, as @BarackObama was doing, is shocking. Future politicians should never allow that situation to occur.
2528 2018-03-10 17:51:42 >.< The USA has been at war 93% of it's existence. In fact 214 out of her 237 calendar years of existence....

Who would of thought we'd still have oil left in the world xD

2537 2018-03-10 17:50:39 Wrong. Over supply drives down wages and under supply drives up wages. It’s the same with shop prices, oil prices, gold, in fact practically anything. It’s basic economics. Workers over supplying the labour market is no different.
2538 2018-03-10 17:50:36 Nope.
2539 2018-03-10 17:50:34 As for oil prices, easy for you to say perhaps, but in America people drive long distances to and from work so they appreciate very much the low oil prices. Until electric cars catch up that is the way it is. Of course electric cars will be charged by fossil fuel plants. :)

2545 2018-03-10 17:50:21 Thought scaled down, original target was to hit 100% EV by 2030. With huge Oil import bill, India has excellent reasons to go electric. Except for @TataMotors and @MahindraElctrc most multinational auto makers did not contribute much to effort.
2546 2018-03-10 17:50:21 The one thing I hate about my car is that it has the special “eco” engine, so oil changes cost me a small fortune 
2547 2018-03-10 17:50:20 Of course they are comparable. They are both Sovereign nations with their own currency & with great wealth - Venezuela has huge oil reserves & Zimbabwe Diamonds, Gold & Coal. Didnt stop either of them turning into basket cases in no time flat, did it?
2548 2018-03-10 17:50:17 Hope prediction comes to fruition. Pleasure meeting you plus family at soccer game few weeks back. I agree with your assessment that Russia scandal all about the oil deal with Exxon. Pipeline would run through eastern Ukraine ending at Crimea ports, so clearly why Putin took it.

2584 2018-03-10 17:45:01 I largely agree, oil will be around for a while yet and nuclear energy plays a part too. But US has greatly expanded solar and has pitential for a lot more. Encouraging oil use theough low prices only makes disasters inevitable

AS far as polluting the atmosphere via oil buddies, that statement indicates you have limited knowledge of the benefits of carbon based fuels.  Imagine how hungry you would be without them.

2597 2018-03-10 17:43:46 they are and I think what’s going on is I accidentally got cedarwood essential oil on my shirt collar which is the happiest accident

2605 2018-03-10 17:42:41 i poured the oil in the hole because i thought that made the most sense
then i googled it and it was like 'DO NOT POUR OIL IN HOLE' 
n now it doesn't make vapour and just sounds like a straw lmaoo
2606 2018-03-10 17:42:22 Oil money needed asap.
2607 2018-03-10 17:42:20 I don't. I just use a cream and oil. If you want your hair big, stretch it first. Then, knot it. If size doesn't matter, do it on freshly washer hair. I twist my small sections, then knot them
2608 2018-03-10 17:42:19 money and oil do that to you.

2611 2018-03-10 17:42:07 @realDonaldTrump Why is Interior Dept. safety official Scott Angele telling oil drillers in the Gulf to call him on issues instead of writing or emails? No public record for calls so no accountability for his decisions to allow unsafe operations in our waters. Slimy operator.
2612 2018-03-10 17:42:05 If you find a do it once and leave it, do share. We've just had to oil, re-oil and oil some more...!
2613 2018-03-10 17:42:00 As I’m older I really do believe in certain biblical sanctions I grew up knowing. Like cursing and blessings are like oil and water. I make it a huge deal to not curse. It’s really evil if you think about it.
2614 2018-03-10 17:41:46 Yeah, MCT oil doesn’t taste like coconut at all. But I don’t drink coffee without it anymore. Gives me a huge rush of energy.

I can’t believe conservatives are letting this fly. Why are they? The above statements?
2623 2018-03-10 17:40:39 No, that's really not of interest, because all what's happening since a long time, is only driven by economy, even WWI and WWII, economy, patents, inventions, and US-wars today are only fight for G.O.D. -Gold Oil Drugs.
2624 2018-03-10 17:40:36 I’m tempted by yacht varnish. Know I won’t remember to oil regularly so prefer a once and forever solution. Wondered if there’s a marketed yacht varnish style product for worktops. Maybe too much to hope for!

2687 2018-03-10 17:32:19 All Obama did was continue the machine that bush created, screaming WOMD so we the people would be ok with them secretly stealing oil.
Hillary was supposed to keep the same ugle machine until my president Trump threw a wrench in the gears.
2688 2018-03-10 17:32:09 Mix organic coconut oil, olive oil, Ghana castor oil, conditioner and water in a spray bottle. Spray dailyinfact any oil of your choice
2689 2018-03-10 17:32:08 The only supplement I take is Omega Rx fish oil from Dr Sears. Hopefully, that one is on your approved list.
2690 2018-03-10 17:32:04 I've been using a tsp of coconut oil in my coffee and a splash of half and half and it is soooo perfect
2691 2018-03-10 17:31:55 Trump may have avoided such scorn had he softened his approach. He lives in a glass house. Two examples his wife's immigrant status and accent makes a perfect target & Florida excluded from off shore oil and gas drilling with his Mira Lago resort location.
2692 2018-03-10 17:31:33 This face oil fully said 'not greasy' uno
2693 2018-03-10 17:31:29 By not giving our oil away to corporations.
2694 2018-03-10 17:31:27 @AtomsksSanakan France and Germany and Netherlands have been using solar and wind for how long?
Seems odd they would be still building coal plants.
Where is the progress there. If they had the oil resources we have, they wouldn't be pushing the green scam.
2695 2018-03-10 17:31:25 กูผิดหรืออ 555
2696 2018-03-10 17:31:19 Correct.  Note we did NOT take much of Iraq's oil after 2003...we only changed pricing of it back to USD.
2697 2018-03-10 17:31:09 Would suggest that by the time we approach March 2019, the sense of grievance and betrayal will be towards the snake oil merchants that persuaded people into voting to leave, rather than foreign powers or people calling for a ref. that's wanted by a 16% margin
2698 2018-03-10 17:31:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but American futures.
2699 2018-03-10 17:30:49 This is an anti US oil Protest homey, we protesting Kinder Morgan, a large american oil company. My goodness you'd think if Big Oil was going to buy astroturf it would be a bit more educated about Kinder Morgan.
2700 2018-03-10 17:30:48 10 Corporates earning big bucks, "data is the new oil." Hello, unsolicited emails, phone calls, and targeted advertising to sat the LEAST.
2701 2018-03-10 17:30:47 Uhmmmm.....made an appointment for 10 am oil change and got here at 9:52 am. It is now 11:30 am and I am still here waiting. Not really feeling it. #anconaisslowwww
2702 2018-03-10 17:30:44 Just found out I have to call ahead to dispose of the oil.  May require more investigation
2703 2018-03-10 17:30:39 My Saturday morning tip:

I've had a cold all week, if you want to help with your breathing, sniffles and scratchy throat then you should try a diffuser. I have been putting in Eucalyptus oil all week, I swear by the diffuers and holistic oils.
2704 2018-03-10 17:30:35 Don’t oil changes usually take 15 mins? I’ve been here for an hour. I’m ready for my cheat meal 
2705 2018-03-10 17:30:22 U forgot to add red oil
2706 2018-03-10 17:30:20 Zero point exists. Why else would he give China direct access to middle east oil,I believe this is why they keep talking about the importance of property rights,so everyone can't pirate our technology like they have been.
2707 2018-03-10 17:30:20 Secular/atheism has the deadliest track record. They invade countries, bomb indiscriminately for oil & resources. Their mega-corps are consuming resources and making the planet unsustainable, just for short term quarterly profit.
2708 2018-03-10 17:30:17 Heard they killed innocent people. It was a likely reprisal attack but they just killed people who are were on their own.
2709 2018-03-10 17:30:03 No.  I'm saying US foreign policy bc USD is an oil derivative.  If you disagree, I would be intensely interested to hear your version of geopolitics of the past 40+ yrs.
2710 2018-03-10 17:30:00 Perhaps because Russia could retaliate by raising prices or even cut our oil supply? Or in the worst case  scenario of war, would wipe us out within weeks.
2711 2018-03-10 17:29:40 Sorry meant to write oil not gas
2712 2018-03-10 17:29:23 Russian oil.
2713 2018-03-10 17:29:20 Did they have oil wells in their back yards? No? Well then, what did they expect?
2714 2018-03-10 17:29:18 We tried it & Mom didn't like it as much as the cooking oil with THC. I have a few other things I can use 2 help her through some of the tough days. I think we're in good shape 4 the 1st round & can adjust as we need 2.
2715 2018-03-10 17:28:49 Or move to clean, renewable alternatives? End our dependency on oil?

2726 2018-03-10 17:28:01 Yeah tbh I hardly use it on my face ever, just the rest of my body, sometimes I use a salve that has the same oils but organic beeswax instead of Shea butter. Overall creams are harsh on skin membranes, maybe try just the olive oil?
2727 2018-03-10 17:27:44 COCONUT OIL IS SOMETHING ELSE Y'ALL OMG, i'm marrying coconut oil
2728 2018-03-10 17:27:40 I am currently living in the gulf coast of Texas and it is so disappointing to see all the oil rigs/refineries and their emissions  all around an area that could be so beautiful.
2729 2018-03-10 17:27:36 Anyone from oil company
2730 2018-03-10 17:27:04 I get into Ubers to have stimulating conversations about how Tesla, Amazon, and big oil companies will be going under soon. To these guys $150-$200B revenue companies can fold overnight.

2733 2018-03-10 17:26:40 That might almost seem worse, but this is the idiot who increased the price of a life saving drug 5000%. How many died b/c of him?
2734 2018-03-10 17:26:37 He needs to step down for putting us all and our animal friends in serious jeopardy with his dirty & secret ideas, catering to his oil cronies friends, those who wants to destroy everything. No more secrets or behind doors hushed secret meetings. Enough is enough.

2738 2018-03-10 17:25:30 Omega-6 soy, corn, and canola oil are PRO INFLAMMATORY oils. Not quackery. Truth. Go find a “snack” or chip or granola bar that doesn’t contain these. Inflammation equals disease.
2739 2018-03-10 17:25:11 Friends & money.... oil & water
2740 2018-03-10 17:25:03 No biggie I spose it was only $19 million dollars! We had a bit of oil money left sure so we thought it was ok, so why not just let bygones  be bygones and forget it all went on.
2741 2018-03-10 17:24:55 The more oil we use the more Nikola Tesla energy suppression. Jet Fuel consumption will go to a trickle to power a Tesla Turbine and High Voltage Generator for a flight taking minuets around the world lifting any weight.
2742 2018-03-10 17:24:48 Olive oil. The coconut oil one didn’t hold my hair down and it flaked up.

2744 2018-03-10 17:24:23 /settles in for a two-hour wait for an oil change since I guess appointments don't matter? 
2745 2018-03-10 17:24:22 How about Nigeria government who have been taken crude oil their for many years
2746 2018-03-10 17:24:21 Think we can all agree the Saudis are cunts and we should have nothing to do with them. Won't even need their oil soon anyway. Hopefully the world will improve when their money and influence run out.
2747 2018-03-10 17:24:12 That goes to the core of "no blood for oil" and the boast "we turn on the oil spigot like a tap."
2748 2018-03-10 17:23:56 Y’all CJ has the baby oil in the bathtub, he has no shame
2749 2018-03-10 17:23:34 I got the money for everything but no damn ride n I need a oil change so I’m not getting on no highway in my shit 
2750 2018-03-10 17:23:34 Then I'll go get my oil changed,car washed & hit up Sallys.
2751 2018-03-10 17:23:33 You have lambasted me over your presumptions. I do live in the east, but many, many friends & family west. Many suffered under Harper, difference was the oil boom was just ending, wasn’t as severe. Things do gradually get worse. You have presumed I adore all of Trudeau policies,
2752 2018-03-10 17:23:19 Actually it's 4.5 years more.

2763 2018-03-10 17:22:02 He stays on because there is oil in them, their countries.
2764 2018-03-10 17:21:59 Fortunately these batshit self promoters are running in true #blue California. Only in parts of the inland empire and the northeast corner of the state would they find an audience for their brand of snake oil.

2774 2018-03-10 17:20:53 It also doesn't work for everyone. I've had some serious reactions to coconut oil (acne, dryness) and have to avoid it in products.
2775 2018-03-10 17:20:53 For real... one time I was thinking (not even talking) about taking my car into Larry’s for an oil change. Guess what showed up in my FB ads.... LARRYS FRIGGEN SHOP dude.
2776 2018-03-10 17:20:52 @atiyeahthoughts we kinda need oil to live everyday..

2783 2018-03-10 17:20:28 I’ve reached the point in my diet where to clean up a spilled bottle of olive oil I seriously considered “spilling” some oregano and “cleaning it up” with a loaf of bread.
2784 2018-03-10 17:20:26 How much is there in the Scottish Oil Fund? My guess is £000000000000
2785 2018-03-10 17:20:19 The errors are so easily avoided by doing any amount of research into the subject. But by all means, Tim, be a smug asshole about it.

2788 2018-03-10 17:20:03 Woowww. This is good spot to see mix. of wealth and ignorance. My wife is an Arab she is proud of being an arab but she is ashamed of you. Your ignorance competes with your oil reserves.

2790 2018-03-10 17:19:45 Thank you love! I’ll definitely look into it. I just bought a new facial moisturizer to pair with the oil. I’ll try it out! 
2791 2018-03-10 17:19:41 @DLoesch Ms. Loesch, I saw your flippant comment regarding how some parents choose to protect their children. I assume,by your logic, you do not vaccinate your children, animals, or change the oil in your car.I would encourage you to witness an autopsy of a teen slain by an AR-15
2792 2018-03-10 17:19:33 He's just a strange guy.  I work with creative-types like him, and they can be brilliant, but weird.  (I count myself as the latter.)  Odd obsessions.  Though usually things like beard oil or artisanal unicycles.
2793 2018-03-10 17:19:24 Have you tried CBD oil? Works on headaches for some folks.

2796 2018-03-10 17:19:01 Getting my oil changed and having to listen to Joy Reid on MSNBC for half an hour. 

Holy shit. 
2797 2018-03-10 17:18:57 It’s immoral to take all those profits from the oil execs, doncha know?
2798 2018-03-10 17:18:53 You cited Trump saying that every president promised to move to capital of Israel to Jerusalem
Also that all presidents since Reagan promised to open ANWR to oil drilling 
Both of those statements are demonstrably false
Don't you owe it to your listeners to say they are false???
2799 2018-03-10 17:18:47 With that Johnson's baby oil smell.
2800 2018-03-10 17:18:44 Are you dense??! The Senator said exactly what happened back then during @GEJonathan 
The US in their usual treachery, stopped buying our Oil and actually didn’t want Nig to have a friend in China. Cos they knew that Nig with China behind them, they don’t need US

2802 2018-03-10 17:18:30 @ClimateAudit suggested that it is perfectly fine to force people in Europe to buy air conditioners so that his oil buddies can keep on polluting the atmosphere. #NotVeryLibertarian

2817 2018-03-10 17:16:20 They seem quite happy to move the morality goal posts to wherever it suits their agenda. The ultra mega evangelical preachers to any lay person looking in are nothing more than Snake Oil Salesmen. Just like Trump who is the Grandaddy of all con men

2822 2018-03-10 17:16:04 In india, everything from deodorants to tiles to tires to oil to flasks etc is sold in the name of army and nationalism. They day is not far when contraceptives join this trend.

Some olive oil on your ice cream?
2825 2018-03-10 17:15:32 It is indeed.  And it's not all about oil either,  It's been genuinely nice talking with you, but I have to go and tend to the animals now.  I'm very pro EU and very Pro Indy.  I think that iScotland would manage fine in the EU - their diverse economy & smaller pop. an advantage

2832 2018-03-10 17:14:31 The FDA and FTC don't want Mom & Pop stores selling coconut oil by promoting its health benefits backed by actual studies, but they're overjoyed allowing huge corporations to sell soda pop with the label DIET when every study shows that people who drink that crap gain weight.

2844 2018-03-10 17:13:29 That’s like saying the war on obesity is incompatible with expanding food production. Why the focus on producers, when consumers slurp down more and more oil every single year?

2891 2018-03-10 17:06:58 (3 of 3) I also get that some Tesla advocates react disproportionately to any  criticism.

2978 2018-03-10 16:57:40 What differentiates the Venezuelan Cryptocurrency from the other is that this currency will be backed by the national reserves of gold, oil, diamond and gas. also, it is the first cryptocurrency officially launched by a government.
2979 2018-03-10 16:57:36 They’re not happy with how the clubs being run.... easy for a chelsea fan to talk after your club was injected by oil money
2980 2018-03-10 16:57:35 I made my own avocado oil..I finally have good moisture in my hair 
2981 2018-03-10 16:57:35 They were very confident going into today’s game too I’d say. They just can’t take their oil. @toobanlad was at the game too, hope he’s drowning his sorrows in a good bar now in Manchester to soften the blow

2983 2018-03-10 16:57:20 @elonmusk how do we overcome the demand for circuitry?. Once plastics/rubber/oil reserves dwindle what things are we making to maintain sustainable energy without the need for renewables to create sustainable technology?.
2984 2018-03-10 16:56:59 An occasional grilled lamb chop probably won’t hurt and the flavor is so incredible! I marinate them in olive oil, garlic, mint, rosemary, lemon zest and lemon juice the grill quickly over high heat. Yum!
2985 2018-03-10 16:56:54 Please no. Palm oil
2986 2018-03-10 16:56:54 dah salah beli  nak beli cleansing oil bukan cleansing water mashaallah dahlah mahal

2988 2018-03-10 16:56:05 The fryer belched up a bunch of oil onto the floor. Coworker's response? "I ain't dealin with it!" And walking away.
2989 2018-03-10 16:56:00 Fingers crossed I'll be able to get my car registered , my brakes and oil change and I'll be good to go

2994 2018-03-10 16:55:32 Yeah, Trump would've let the oil remain in the water the same way he's making the people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands wait for FEMA relief and approved building off-shore drilling rigs up and down our coasts to support the oil industry.
2995 2018-03-10 16:55:32 I'm asking YOU why .@SenSanders Is not asked to GO AWAY since he lost the primary by a large margin-you seem to be all to eager to have @HillaryClinton sit down-this snake oil salesman should not only sit down, but GO AWAY FOREVER...just a reminder Bernie..YOU ARE NOT A DEMOCRAT
2996 2018-03-10 16:55:31 But necessary. They've destroyed the clubs history, they've destroyed the foundation of west ham, and they've destroyed this current squad by somehow managing to make them worse in January. They have nothing but snake oil.
2997 2018-03-10 16:55:26 Awesome I'll keep an eye out my wife wants them more then me we are both cat and sprint car lovers and harli fans keep at it!

3000 2018-03-10 16:54:46 I start with crushed garlic in olive oil. I use at least 6 cloves, but YMMV. After that cooks a few minutes, add sliced onions. Add a little more olive oil if needed. Let them carmelize slightly. While that’s happening, blender time!
3001 2018-03-10 16:54:40 Yup. And they've transmitted that hatred (there was some before Mcdavid and there is some general Alberta hatred) to the refs. Evidence: for instance Ducks series. Now with Oil out of playoffs Mcdavid given a penalty shot.

3004 2018-03-10 16:54:11 For Tillerson, it's Arctic oil deal. The rest? Fame and fortune (if they stay out of jail). Just like why so-called normal people go on regular #RealityTV shows. These people will ALL be in the history books, while the rest if the world gets f*cked @BeschlossDC @JoyAnnReid

3031 2018-03-10 16:50:59 Saturday late morning/afternoon plan: take a nap 

Saturday late morning/afternoon reality: sit at Walmart and wait for an oil change.
3032 2018-03-10 16:50:49 Hypocrisy at its best. You are a snake oil salesman leading fools.
3033 2018-03-10 16:50:34 Why should taxpayers be on the hook for any spill response?  Shouldn’t the companies that move the oil be 100% responsible for clean up?

3037 2018-03-10 16:49:50 This Honda dealership blows my phone up about service, to the extent I blocked their number. Here for oil change, took 5 minutes (and counting) before someone came to see what I needed. *waits on customer survey*
3038 2018-03-10 16:49:24 Cbd oil?
3039 2018-03-10 16:49:23 Why must you use words like numbskull while having a. conversation? Is that how you are in person? What an unpleasant sort. You, personally, use oil daily but vilify it, blaming society instead. That position appears rather hypocritical but then many eco-zealots are.
3040 2018-03-10 16:49:10 Happy Weekend @jimcramer   You don't seem to like oil stocks, but you've made pos. comments on  $EOG and  $SLB.   I'm a Long Term investor.  Are these good to hold?  Thanks   Happy Saturday!

3058 2018-03-10 16:47:29 hm I didn’t know that, but I’ve never even used coconut oil for my face. I only use it for my body and my hair

3074 2018-03-10 16:45:46 I know it sucks but I would like to make a suggestion. It is fairly warm today. Break out the grill and cook your favorite grill food. Be creative with it. Sliced potatoes put them on a sheet with some oil and seasoning. With no power it could be fun. :) Pulling for you guys.

3081 2018-03-10 16:45:15 Except that this is an unsustainable pointless #greenwashing gesture, only made possible by heavy subsidies of our tax money (most of which was generated, ironically, by oil extraction).

Still giving environmentalism a bad name, I see.
3082 2018-03-10 16:45:15 A recall on my steering wheel  all I came for was a oil change and a wash! Almost three hours of my morning

3129 2018-03-10 16:40:10 Argon Oil // no flaking
3130 2018-03-10 16:40:08 My most complete beauty routine that only happens on weekends: double cleanse-exfoliate-mask+pore pack-tone-serum-oil-moisturiser. Most days it's: forget-to-even-wash-my-makeup-and-sleep-with-it
3131 2018-03-10 16:40:03 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3132 2018-03-10 16:39:52 Na vit E oil ah hair ku use panni irukan ka ,nala  irukum
3133 2018-03-10 16:39:48 That’s a bit of a weak dose. Get some clove oil - the taste is vile but it’s really good for helping with infection & oral pain. Warm water & salt mouth wash too: gargle it and spit it out. It’ll all help with pain
3134 2018-03-10 16:39:32 Hot oil treatment
3135 2018-03-10 16:39:26 分かり過ぎて首ガクガクです笑
堪りませんね…歴代の推し並べて自分って好みブレてないなって納得しちゃいますもん
ブレてない上に減る事なく増え続けるのがまた嬉しい悲鳴なんですけど
3136 2018-03-10 16:39:11 Why do oil changes take forever 
3137 2018-03-10 16:38:57 Secretary Tillerson worked all his life with one of the largest oil firms in the World (Exxon).The Horn of Africa has oil deposits possibly exceeding that of Saudi Arabia.Kenya is strategically placed to partner in business
3138 2018-03-10 16:38:53 I bet he's spending big for pictures of the national parks to and piped in national park air too.  Then connected folks can go in and see what they were once like before they were turned over to the oil  and entertainment industries.
3139 2018-03-10 16:38:46 Flaxseed is lower in linoleic acid (pro-inflammatory omega-6) than many other seeds and contains some ALA. I still see no reason to include flaxseeds or flax oil in the human diet...
3140 2018-03-10 16:38:20 Yes! Popcorn is made with canola oil and salt.
3141 2018-03-10 16:38:15 Ran my errands, planned my pay off strategy for my laptop, got an oil change to get done, then I'm gonna sit on my ass and play the sims 3 until the wee hours of the morn.
3142 2018-03-10 16:38:11 Oil & Filter check/change $29.99
3143 2018-03-10 16:37:41 My new Minecraft server is going to have an oil industry, and it will be privatised because I can’t be bothered to learn the Immersive Petroleum mod 
3144 2018-03-10 16:37:32 Why the unrest? It’s all about power & money.  In this case the money is natural resources (gold, diamonds, uranium, oil).

Globalists want to replace government in South Africa w/ a global Marxist regime. It’s easier to control people to do their bidding once in power.
3145 2018-03-10 16:37:27 And as long as they invest in their people and infrastructure they won’t be left in the dust when oil runs out or prices decline
3146 2018-03-10 16:37:24 Avoiding cliches is cool but the whole way none techies talk about AI is ridiculous... algorithms and machine learning have been around forever, if you or they don't talk about #AI as an upgrade to these facts then they are just selling snake oil... yes, an oil reference 
3147 2018-03-10 16:36:47 @asyouuuwiiish you are most likely Chinese, and that is just awesome. I want to learn about life from you. While you are as beautiful as a cleaned up oil spill in another dimension, I don't want to date you. I just want the world to know that you make air collide with magic.
3148 2018-03-10 16:36:25 Our candidates are 3 women; one is highly knowledgeable & qualified in all areas, specifically rural econ, one is extremely exciting & making a connection w/ young voters that we’ll need to flip #CA01, and one is an oil lawyer that answers to tech companies on the coast.
3149 2018-03-10 16:36:20 บางทีก็คิดนะ จะมีเงินเก็บมั้ยวะ ถ้าเมนจะมีเรื่องให้เปย์ตลอดแบบนี้ 5555
3150 2018-03-10 16:36:16 Dubai discovered oil in 1971. Nigeria discovered it in 1959. Within the next 20 years Dubai underwent a transformation unrivaled in the history of this world while we were groveling in slum because of greed. I was angry with Nigeria, Nigerians and myself.
3151 2018-03-10 16:36:05 Probably by constantly dumping waste into our ocean as well as like the atomic bombs we’ve set off... trash, oil, radiation... I feel like it can reach places even we can’t and leave a good amount of our ocean fucked
3152 2018-03-10 16:35:52 Money  oil buddies   Keep tabs on POTUS
3153 2018-03-10 16:35:45 Also I got terrible burns at McDonald's. I had the criss-cross pattern of the fry basket burned into my arm for weeks because someone turned too fast during a rush and hit me on the arm with a basket that had just come out of the oil.
3154 2018-03-10 16:35:41 In Gambia everywhere you go you see brand new trucks broken down at the side of the road, run until they run out of oil or water then seize up. Nothing said by anyone can get these people to look after anything.
3155 2018-03-10 16:35:38 A little bit of CA in FL.  Like oil and vinegar.
3156 2018-03-10 16:35:34 I'm positive. That and the CBD oil was the whole reason Joy hates me in the first place. It was written in sharpie. She may have back tracked but the initial video djd. Regardless when is she done with me? Contacting my companies and sponsors? When is enough because of opinions?
3157 2018-03-10 16:35:28 ช่วงนี้จะทำตัวเป็นเด็กดีของพ่อกับแม่ แววมาว่าจะต้องขอเงินพ่อมาเปย์ผู้ งื้ออออออ !!
3158 2018-03-10 16:35:10 Even better: Guy talking to her about her oil change, her response about hearing about her Ecoboost engine: "What's a turbocharger?"
3159 2018-03-10 16:34:51 To impose to world islamaphhobi and again oil and they were gone like in a couple month. Well if this was that easy why didn’t you wipe them before. Tools come and go but Imperialism is always in the Middle East. THERE IS A WAR FOR POWER. Only innocents die. Open ur eyes.
3160 2018-03-10 16:34:47 Inplay Oil Corp. (IPO) Analysts See $0.01 E...
3161 2018-03-10 16:34:38 Olive Oil. Didn’t like the flaxseed or coconut oil ones
3162 2018-03-10 16:34:27 Either Tillerson still wants that Exxon oil deal with Putin or Putin has something on him too.
3163 2018-03-10 16:34:24 @Drjeffress is just a grifter “Christian”. Supports @realDonaldTrump policies of ruining families and hurting the poor. Can’t imagine what he’s hiding based on the bullshit he preaches. They both sell their own version of snake oil like carnival barkers. Sad that people buy it.
3164 2018-03-10 16:34:22 He just cares about his oil deals.
3165 2018-03-10 16:34:20 Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh abdullah change your oil hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
3166 2018-03-10 16:34:17 This will make you Hmmm. I'm in Edmonton AB. The province with the dreaded oil sands. We treat all sewage & nothing goes into the river & also home of world class waste management & recycling facility. Other world cities visit to see how we do it.
3167 2018-03-10 16:33:57 i be at the shop with my car getting a routine oil change praying they don’t tell me something else is wrong with my car  cause it’s always something with Storm 
3168 2018-03-10 16:33:57 I love @VitaCoco coconut oil
3169 2018-03-10 16:33:49 So, no fuel sat in your chainsaw and ethanol somehow destroyed it!?! Never heard that one before.  
You mean the oil industry wouldn’t continue to use a replacement product & give up more precious market share? Guess that is why we have an RFS...
3170 2018-03-10 16:33:13 Putin sells oil to Kim in spite of sanctions.  Kim owes Putin.  Kim sends invitation at Putin's instructions.  Trump answers immediately because he knew invitation was coming.  Putin makes Trump look strong.  Meeting in May, middle of primaries.  Putin meddles again in elections.

3172 2018-03-10 16:32:34 มีโครงการเงินกู้เพื่อติ่งมั้นคะะะะะ หมุนไม่ทัน

3174 2018-03-10 16:32:15 i was just thinking the same thing!! i’m at the ford dealership getting my oil changed and i kid you not, there was an ad for ford on instagram when swiping through the stories
3175 2018-03-10 16:32:13 People are free to self select. That doesn't mean that gov't shouldn't worry about the vast gender discrepancy in the STEM fields. Gov'ts also provide benefits to oil and gas and mining companies - that does mean they are dictating that you work for one.
3176 2018-03-10 16:32:08 I remember a profession explaining to me that drops must be matched or will make dry eyes worse. For instance MDG dry eye needs high oil content drops, as high water would dry them out more, tear deficiencies need more water less oil, Allergics need more ectoin, combos need mix
3177 2018-03-10 16:32:07 Oil change, lights changed and car wash all before noon. I just want to be lazy on a Saturday. 
3178 2018-03-10 16:32:00 Pruitt is one of the top schills for the oil, gas, and chem industries.  Spent his time as AG of OK fighting for them.  If he wants to be a lobbyist, that's fine.  Quit the EPA and get registered.  I do not accept that he gets to run the EPA and act as an unregistered lobbyist.
3179 2018-03-10 16:31:46 Yes. And a hint of motor oil. I'm growing chest hair just looking at it tbh
3180 2018-03-10 16:31:45 ผลิตตังค์ไม่ทันแล้วววว
3181 2018-03-10 16:31:16 919 if you need brake, alternators, oil change hmp or comment below. I am certified to work on cars
3182 2018-03-10 16:31:14 It is apparent you don’t have a grasp on the oil/gas situation economically. Not easy to build another refinery. The cost would bankrupt a company. That’s why the switch from that mindset to pipelines. But as you make Alberta suffer so shall you, the bullshit you foist upon us.
3183 2018-03-10 16:30:37 "Interior Dept official used oil industry agit-prop to promote reality-denying bullsh*t." There; fixed it for you.
3184 2018-03-10 16:30:25 The oil makes a lot more money than that m8 it pays for the Westminster government to run the UK. There should never be any food banks in this country.
3185 2018-03-10 16:30:23 oil
3186 2018-03-10 16:30:19 Oil se nahi greese se r@pe ho ga
3187 2018-03-10 16:30:15 The Deep Cleansing Oil is a must have! Adore it!
3188 2018-03-10 16:30:10 なんか…こう…あるじゃないですか好みのキャラとかCP傾向っていうのが…　この人たちも化物とか暴走とか運命とか言ってましたから…世界観的にはフィットするものがあるような気がしますね…
3189 2018-03-10 16:30:02 Rick Perry Sec’ty of “making things easier for oil and gas companies” is so bought and paid for he probably gets an envelope of cash every time he says things like moving away from fossil fuels is immoral. I foresee Justice 4him after death imprisoned in a smokestack 4eternity
3190 2018-03-10 16:30:00 Notley does not have the ability to stop Oil coming to BC, as she has said repeatedly it's trans provincial oils shipments are in Federal Jurisdiction, not in the vindictive hands Alberta politicians.  Let the eastern now western bastards freeze.
3191 2018-03-10 16:29:56 Hogg has become a shill for all of the left’s talking points as if he somehow has acquired the knowledge to opine ona variety of issues, but he is too young to purchase a gun. I suspect he is too young to purchase a gun or opine as his young mind is easily manipulated.
3192 2018-03-10 16:29:45 bio oil, bioplacenton, vaseline potreleum jelly
3193 2018-03-10 16:29:44 The first evos would purge out the oil. Come back in morning and a puddle of oil wth. After that, I never had an oil sick left behind.
3194 2018-03-10 16:29:33 Tea and tv followed by coffee date and shopping. I got a pair of shorts and new beard oil and now I’m at the gym and Jason is off for more shopping
3195 2018-03-10 16:29:20 @IndianOilcl it is ugly test of Indian Oil to focus and adv words ''Phele Indian later Indian Oil" why such a stupid ad
3196 2018-03-10 16:29:00 And you don't think it would be advantageous for a country that has depended solely on oil for years to begin to move away as an intelligent move.  Nuclear energy for energy, peaceful purposes, is NOT a bad thing. POTUS has been fighting proliferation, why would he want more...??
3197 2018-03-10 16:28:52 yeah lmfao. got that shit on lock, coconut oil always on deck. thanks for asking 
3198 2018-03-10 16:28:26 I use Gun oil and bathe in their tears
3199 2018-03-10 16:28:04 I'm in the steel buisness...a lot of cheap steel sold from Mx and Canada comes from China.
China can build and sell steel cheaper than most counties can manuf !
Look..all I'm saying is America is making a change and self reliance like on oil is a great thing for America!
3200 2018-03-10 16:28:01 O'Shea slower turning circle than an oil tanker there.
3201 2018-03-10 16:27:30 Dropped the car off for an oil change. Service tech: Are you waiting or dropping off? Me: How Long is the wait? Tech: There’s seven cars ahead of you. Me: how long is the wait? Tech: About an hour and a half. #communicationproblems #repeatthequestion #letstrythisagain
3202 2018-03-10 16:27:26 Gala seller or groundnut oil seller?
3203 2018-03-10 16:27:23 Happy to be part of the ROC-EV initiative to have EV charging station available at our office this Year. The time to buy or lease an Electric Vehicle is NOW. Say Good Bye to Oil and Gas.
3204 2018-03-10 16:27:12 懐かしいけど今でも色褪せないですよね！リヴァイさんもエレンも衣装似合ってて違和感仕事しなさ過ぎて最初普通に見ちゃいました笑
3205 2018-03-10 16:26:54 They kept drilling until they struck oil.
3206 2018-03-10 16:26:40 I do wonder about the climate change component especially considering shipping oil products by rail or trucks, the impact and dangers?.
3207 2018-03-10 16:26:29 I just spent 5 minutes trying to explain to Odin what an oil change is in terms he would understand...
3208 2018-03-10 16:26:28 I’ve owned the @NyxCosmetics lip oil for less than a day and I’m already obsessed
3209 2018-03-10 16:26:24 That's fantastic and we thank you but I would like to remind you that our urgent health crises will not slow down until we remove the elements that are responsible for causing the diseases and cancers. Stop Monsanto, Dow Chemicals, Oil companies, factory animal farming. 
Thanks
3210 2018-03-10 16:26:18 u just reminded me that i desperately need an oil change but I DONT HAvE EnOUGH mONEY

3215 2018-03-10 16:25:44 Actually, we managed to avoid cliché. No mention of #Asimov no claims that "data is the new oil"  #AI

3217 2018-03-10 16:25:11 Yeah, I think I'm gunna go change my oil soon.
Good luck man!
3218 2018-03-10 16:25:05 Go see a dentist you mentalist!  Clove oil & ibuprofen will help with pain though! Cracked teeth sounds like you’ve probably worn away the enamel & they are quite weak anyway!  I hear crowns or veneers calling you 
3219 2018-03-10 16:25:03 @Valvoline the worst customer service ever!! Do not go there unless you want your car screwed up.   My car was a mess after they changed the oil.  Beware!!
3220 2018-03-10 16:25:01 OOO for sure Dennis is way wrong.  He wants a weakened NATO, sactions, and oil deals.
3221 2018-03-10 16:24:59 Oil money???? Does that mean your dad works at a Shell station?

3227 2018-03-10 16:24:25 I just got it at ECCC from Hal (I mentioned you, btw). I pledged for one on KS and he just gave me the one he had on hand (which had been handled). He mentioned to clean it up use ferric chloride, glycerine soap, and oil to protect it and I said “easy!”

3233 2018-03-10 16:23:57 But they are being tossed. No need to protect air or water or land Sell it to the oil and uranium mining companies. They’ve never degraded the environment or hurt people’s health? Maybe we make solar panels? But steel tariffs? Shouldn’t be using steel if we wanna save the planet
3234 2018-03-10 16:23:53 Just be wary that there's further research underway restricting claims that are being made left right & centre about medicinal benefits of cannabidiol. I legally sell pure CBD oil at work but currently can't make claims about it until the study is complete and evidence available.
3235 2018-03-10 16:23:53 Who has an oil rig in austin!??

3242 2018-03-10 16:23:14 Things I want to spend my day doing: watching hockey in bed with coffee. 
Things I’m forced to spend my day doing because life is dumb: patching giant ass holes in a wall and repainting areas of water damage, oil painting late into the night despite feeling no drive to do that.
3243 2018-03-10 16:23:06 امبارح عملت hot oil masks و حطيت صفار بيض علي مايونيز و زيت چوچوبا و لاڤندر و حطيتهم علي شعري ك-deep conditioning treatment و بعدين جربت الشامبو و الconditioner بتوع elixir و بتاع مريب كده من عبد الصمد القرشي، هو شعري قمر فشخ بس المشكلة إني مش عارفة ده بسبب انهي حاجة بظبط
3244 2018-03-10 16:23:01 So where will you put the oil well?
3245 2018-03-10 16:22:52 Check the replies. Gerrymandering is apparently a massive concern as well lol
3246 2018-03-10 16:22:46 Coconut oil is probably the cure to cancer and we don't even know it
3247 2018-03-10 16:22:39 They are heroes because they protected your oil companies in the middle east? 
It had bugger all to do with democracy that's for sure.
3248 2018-03-10 16:22:31 I'm getting my oil changed and the waiting room they have here is full of middle aged dudes all trying to ignore everyone else.
3249 2018-03-10 16:22:25 GAL YOU GOT OWNED  apply burn oil to affected area 
3250 2018-03-10 16:22:23 Every Car needs oil change for it to work optimum so it give better milage. Once it get repaired it worked perfectly fine and give better average/gallon. Consider Demonitization as a oil change so old dirty corrosive Congress can not damage INDIAN economy.

3256 2018-03-10 16:21:41 One easy method to identify a US-based eco-activist (without viewing all their flashy protest gear): They use the term "Tar-Sands"...Canada doesn't have tar sands, we have oil sands. #vanpoli #burnaby #bcpoli #ableg #abpoli
3257 2018-03-10 16:21:38 I'm gonna try being healthy again. Maybe stop eating so much fast food, stop cooking with oil, drink less soda, make smoothies again every morning, etc. I just need to feel better again, physically and mentally.
3258 2018-03-10 16:21:30 ขอบคุณมากๆนะค่ะ ที่มีซีรี่ย์ดีๆแบบนี้ให้ดู
3259 2018-03-10 16:21:27 How would you handle the Breitbart people when they demand to be part of writing the Constitution? The lawyers for huge businesses? The oil, tobacco, and gambling executives? The libertarian techbros or the 40% who support Trump?
3260 2018-03-10 16:21:26 ขอบคุณที่สร้างตัวละครต่างๆมาทำให้มีความสุขขนาดนี้:)
3261 2018-03-10 16:21:06 Many thanks. If I'm reading this right we have an oil not a gas infrastructure challenge.
3262 2018-03-10 16:20:49 I hate getting my oil changed

3264 2018-03-10 16:20:22 "Olives must be crushed for the oil to be produced."
3265 2018-03-10 16:20:17 but oil is not underlying dollar. One error in this (there are many) is that the currency a thing is priced in != the currency preference to hold. (another is that oil is priced in USD as effect, not cause).
3266 2018-03-10 16:20:14 Coconut oil? Or neem oil? Will help to dry it up. Or hve you taken it off already?
3267 2018-03-10 16:20:04 Right now, my go-to is Elevation Burger - organic beef, fries done in Olive oil.
3268 2018-03-10 16:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

3270 2018-03-10 16:19:35 "Did you have eyelash extensions?"
"Are those your real lashes??"

Castor oil lang po 
3271 2018-03-10 16:19:04 YES, Putin we did impose sanctions- you invaded Ukraine that stopped a 500b land/oil deal between Rosneft & Exxon! You wanted 45 in charge so you could continue corruption at all cost!  Then the audacity to go deep into corrupting our elections, its citizens, process, v-machines
3272 2018-03-10 16:18:39 Coconut Oil got me smelling & feeling like an almond joy!
3273 2018-03-10 16:17:48 I have a new sore on my nose and one on my ballsack. Looks like mom's special olive oil to kill the mites plan didn't work. I'm still oily.
3274 2018-03-10 16:17:32 เค้าจะทำอะไรแก้เหงากันอ่ะ แอร้ยยย #sotusStheseries
3275 2018-03-10 16:17:30 Snake oil....
3276 2018-03-10 16:17:30 Bought a pair of convex mirrors online, and it fell apart on the first day I stuck it to my car's side mirrors zzzz. #sibeicui

Well, now I learnt that olive oil is good for removing tape stains from a mirrored surface.
3277 2018-03-10 16:17:27 sesame fresh rolls and dumplings. . .11

3279 2018-03-10 16:17:13 Natapon yung LAVANDER essential oil ko! Ang mahal mo pa man din. Tinitipid na nga kita, para di ka maubos agad 
3280 2018-03-10 16:16:55 Like Jerry Brown's family oil monopoly in CA.
3281 2018-03-10 16:16:46 Yes, Shkreli rounded up all the people with the rare disease and executed them in death camps. He certainly didn't intentionally improve their access to the drug and try to develop new, healthier drugs with less side effects. What a villain.
3282 2018-03-10 16:16:35 Getting this oil change real quick
3283 2018-03-10 16:16:31 i hope Lt clean the inside of my car after he change my oil
3284 2018-03-10 16:16:30 Literally all of that got fried in olive oil in the same pan. First the potatoes. Then the ham and mushrooms and tomatoes. Then the eggs and bagel  it didn't take long but I kept the first parts in the oven until the eggs were done.
3285 2018-03-10 16:16:00 I have been, Black Jamaican castor oil. Maybe I need to be more consistent with using it I guess
3286 2018-03-10 16:15:56 I love my car then I get free oil changes.
3287 2018-03-10 16:15:45 มาแล้วค่า แพ้คส่งแย้วน๊าาาาาา เช็คเลขได้ในฟอมเยยจ้าาาา
3288 2018-03-10 16:15:42 In light of the Barnett news I will now step up my drinking efforts and include motor oil.
3289 2018-03-10 16:15:25 You know you’ve reached adulthood when you were excited about an oil change and now feel like you can drive anywhere.
3290 2018-03-10 16:15:21 Use castor oil
3291 2018-03-10 16:15:21 What was the prob with Telus???  I went from the evil MTS to Fido and never regretted it.  I had a bell phone when I worked the oil patch.  They were pretty good to.  No complaints.

3293 2018-03-10 16:15:18 Raised awareness of illness in the same way Hitler raised awareness of anti-Semitism. This is veering into personal attacks for you so I'm going to quit now.
3294 2018-03-10 16:15:13 Zinke has ONE job and that's to preserve public land and wildlife. 

Instead, he's selling as much land as possible to oil and mining companies, opening the coast to oil/mineral drilling, and rolling back federal protections on land.
3295 2018-03-10 16:15:05 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it’s royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation
3296 2018-03-10 16:15:01 For HONDA clone generators:
1. Start every month from now on.
2. To each GALLON of non-ethanol rec gas add:
1/2 Oz Sta Bil
1/2 Oz Marvel Mystery Oil (top valve train)
1 Oz Sea Foam (stabilizer plus top valve train)
3. Any surging n test run is pilot jet.

Drain after test.
3297 2018-03-10 16:14:53 For the barmer oil refinery in Rajasthan the state govt has been getting a royalty of 4000cr per annum.AP asked for the same in case of  oil refinery in KG basin but the central govt is deliberately keeping the issue mum.AP should get around 3500cr as royalty per year since 2011.
3298 2018-03-10 16:14:41 ขอบเรามารึยังหรอคะ
3299 2018-03-10 16:14:35 I believe the original purpose was to save lamp oil. I can't imagine what purpose it serves now. Every state doesn't even have it.

3303 2018-03-10 16:14:03 You realize normal coffee is a flavor but a bad one, that I used to disguise with coconut oil butter heavy cream. Now with Vinnie's coffee I only use heavy cream it enhances the flavor. #NSNG
3304 2018-03-10 16:13:59 i am not mad and i am very happy that we started killing terrorist like you. 
you will not trick people with your lies .. usa will not help you when they take their share from the oil and you will be abonded like dogs then we will see..
3305 2018-03-10 16:13:37 The newest trend in skincare: river mud-infused hair oil
3306 2018-03-10 16:13:36 Not sure this is legit. Rare Earth Minerals deposits in Kenya was declared "National Security Threat" years ago. 2013?... Recent "regime" change is probably a CIA move and Rex is there to secure oil and R.E.M. for MIC tech, electric cars, strengthen steel, advanced electric tech.

3308 2018-03-10 16:13:28 The cycling season has only just begun, but I’m already fed up of hearing @carltonkirby making comments about Aru’s looks. Hardly an oil painting yourself are you Carlton.
3309 2018-03-10 16:13:19 Maybe a little kush smoke or cbd oil

3314 2018-03-10 16:12:50 And BTW, What does @EPAScottPruitt require a soundproof phone booth for?  

I mean other than being able to cover up his secret negotiations with his Big Oil Overlords to discuss which Air, Water, and Land Protections, that they want gone... as the "Administrator" of the @EPA

3316 2018-03-10 16:12:14 The futures have been steady for a long time on oil. The issue is taxation.
3317 2018-03-10 16:12:10 “Coconut oil works for everything “ THATS A LIE!!
3318 2018-03-10 16:12:08 Oil money. Exxon Mobil he never left

3320 2018-03-10 16:12:00 Coconut oil is a life saver
3321 2018-03-10 16:11:58 About time for allowing cannabis oil and other plant materials available to those who need them
3322 2018-03-10 16:11:49 Might go to firehouse after this oil change
3323 2018-03-10 16:11:32 Doh...course it does...swap your sunflower/veg oil for desi ghee 
3324 2018-03-10 16:11:31 We don't only want raw fossile oil, we want whale oil as well.
3325 2018-03-10 16:11:21 Think of your product like an organism—growing, shifting, decaying—not an oil painting; a "finished" masterpiece.
3326 2018-03-10 16:11:20 Try @PAMCookingSpray non-aerosol to avoid extra calories from cooking with too much butter and oil.
3327 2018-03-10 16:11:17 I am so impatient that i literally want to leave because I’m waiting to get an oil change 
3328 2018-03-10 16:11:10 Bio oil, aku jg lagi on process nih
3329 2018-03-10 16:11:10 He did nothing of the sort.
He buried this country in debt, remember the BP oil spill that he gladly paid for?

3332 2018-03-10 16:10:59 This new Nigerian made Kellogg cornflakes takes like saw dust mixed in corn oil...Rubbish
3333 2018-03-10 16:10:49 It is all about the oil and money.

3340 2018-03-11 23:59:48 Easier solution than civil war in the west: If AB must produce more from the tarsands, upgrade or refine it in AB. More AB jobs & no dilbit shipped thru dangerous pipelines and polluting tankers. Prices realized for AB oil go up hugely. #abpoli #cdnpoli #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM

3343 2018-03-11 23:59:36 So can I seal in the humectant with an oil like jojoba or rose Hip?
3344 2018-03-11 23:59:17 WORTHLESS INFO: I think Argon / Moroccan oil is hilarious. When I see people put it on themselves or cook with it I find that even more hilarious. #goats
3345 2018-03-11 23:59:04 I completely agree with your last statement. We truly are at the end of our extinction. Ideally we would have an alternative solution by now and there isn't. But the research and development for alternatives require significant oil (ie cobalt & lithium). It's a bad cycle.
3346 2018-03-11 23:58:56 roast it w some salt & olive oil

3382 2018-03-11 23:55:04 Doubt anything is going to change. The oil companies have more power and bought politicians. If you really wanted change vote them out of Congress but some posters aren't going to defeat multi billionaire company.

3387 2018-03-11 23:54:04 Same old scare tactics from the Republicans. Voodo politics & snake oil politicians.

Pres. Obama said he feels he curses too much
3390 2018-03-11 23:53:11 If anybody in the Baltimore area suddenly smells Blueberries, it's coming from my house.

Turns out 2-3 drops per 100ml of water in an oil infuser doesn't mean "just dump some in until it looks good".
3391 2018-03-11 23:53:10 When people ask me "what's that?" In the hot tub, I'm like "oh that's sunscreen oil residue" but I REALLY want to tell them it's actually several billion dead skin cells that have been boiled off gym members sweaty bodies all day 
3392 2018-03-11 23:52:36 @PavilionCorp Dear Sirs,

You are welcome to check personally
3393 2018-03-11 23:52:35 There is nothing cheap about oil extraction in Alberta. Also, I pay taxes so don't worry, I am.

3396 2018-03-11 23:52:08 Grease/oil burns are the fucking worse
3397 2018-03-11 23:52:03 As I said to @maggieNYT , there’s covering the event, and airing it in its entirety. One is the purpose of the media, the other is giving free air time to the snake oil sales guy.
3398 2018-03-11 23:51:59 Remember Peak Oil in the seventies and then the nineties? That had a consensus .
3399 2018-03-11 23:51:42 Hey If Any enough of Bernie bashing or Hillary bashing because only Russian trolls or Bots are pushing this crap! We are under attack by Oil Industries which includes Putin so let's get real! @les_ifany90m

3404 2018-03-11 23:51:05 Dems had the same argument about oil industry!
The truth is now we are oil independent and for the first time in decades we are exporting.
We can produce our own steel.

3418 2018-03-11 23:48:22 Greedy polluting corporations won’t give up until they figure a way to monopolize the clean energy industry. Hence why oil is still the main resource... even after dozens of clean energy inventions - which were all seized by government officials, including their patents

3449 2018-03-11 23:43:16 Landowners, obviously. People who own massive tracts of land. Oil fields. Mines. That's where money comes from. Wall Street is where it goes. Silicon Valley is a relative outlier, because computing tech is the new oilfield.

You are welcome to check personally
3474 2018-03-11 23:39:30 It shouldn't be shipped at all. Besides those problems, the sites processing that mess are damaging the health of those in the area. 

As to the rail problems, that is caused by oil companies taking shortcuts at the shipping points.

3478 2018-03-11 23:38:29 Oh, I forgot to include extra virgin olive oil/rapeseed oil in my list. How silly of me!
3479 2018-03-11 23:38:28 That was because of public debt and the rise of the price of oil. To think that tax cuts had something to do with it is absurd.
3480 2018-03-11 23:37:59 Lots of big oil cheerleaders getting very nervous.

3500 2018-03-11 23:34:09 They came to rally for the oil industry, while breathing our fresh air, taking in the pristine views of our clean harbour, and enjoying the mild seasonal weather that is all in serious jeopardy should they have their way. Hippocrates. 
3501 2018-03-11 23:34:03 Waiting could result in much higher valuation if USD is overvalued vis a vis gold/oil/yuan. Increased oil trade with #China to support #BeltandRoad could also increase strategic value of Aramco as an asset to SA.

3545 2018-03-11 23:25:15 You said that "without their influence the industry would not have survived." So, in your own words, without de Beers this murderous industry - which is STILL killing people - would be dead. Whataboutery is not relevant here; we aren't discussing gold or oil.

3551 2018-03-11 23:24:33 Don't vote stay home like in Alberta @RachelNotley decided to run a conservative attack policy against BC and pipelines for the environment. Voting NDP or UCP the same thing staying home or going green completely turned off lost all faith in AB politics one big con oil collusion

3555 2018-03-11 23:24:09 Well i think if oil are not keeping some ahl guys they should be looking at swapping them. No point in Laleggia etc walking when you can give a look to a player in a similar spot elsewhere.

3566 2018-03-11 23:22:36 It seems logical, but where is this hidden Goliath? Sure AF not in small town BC, where cannabis taste is highly evolved. Ontario towns? Love good weed. Alberta oil patch? Only wants the primo. Quebec? Beautiful flower, good hash, or bust. The alcohol analogy is not perfect.

*single tear*
3598 2018-03-11 23:17:55 Well one is purposely trying to throw litter down one is the opposite... they want as much oil as possible so an oil spill not only fucks up their PR but also hits them on the balance sheet and with fines (referencing BP)

3600 2018-03-11 23:17:34 #SXSW Wellness Expo was half pre-workout and half CBD oil. A good balance I guess?
3601 2018-03-11 23:17:24 I usually just oil all over. I tried growing the tash to wax it but no joy. The Mrs wasn't having it.

3606 2018-03-11 23:16:36 I would wager that any honey oil I saw in my youth was made on the same continent.
Avg to poor quality weed was easy to come by and cheap, and there were groups of people with the resources and know how to make large batches.
3607 2018-03-11 23:16:32 bought some very expensive and award-winning vanilla ice cream for lunch today. still wasn’t a patch on @DianaHenryFood’s olive oil ice cream which sets the standard to which i hold all ice creams.

3611 2018-03-11 23:15:40 I know right down to the gallon. It’s kind of essential to safely reaching destinations. 

What’s your point? That there’s a moral equivalence between private pilots and multinational oil conglomerates who have undermined and lobbied against climate science for 40 years?
3612 2018-03-11 23:15:31 My baby sister gave me some rose oil and my gawddd it’s worked wonders for my face in just two days.

3614 2018-03-11 23:15:23 The feeling you get when both vehicles have new oil and the air in the tires are on point:)
3615 2018-03-11 23:15:20 When conservatives talk about all of the death and destruction communism has caused, why is it that they never acknowledge the destructive results of global colonization, the Atlantic slave trade, or wars fought for oil? You know, the wonderful things capitalism has brought us?

3623 2018-03-11 23:14:37 Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil pretty solid.
3624 2018-03-11 23:14:33 The most important difference is that the "Petro" would become the first cryptocurrency approved by a government for its use as a national currency. It will also be the first cryptocurrency to take as reference the country's assets in this case the oil tankers.
3625 2018-03-11 23:14:28 Both are in his Shadow cabinet.  I don't really think I was being dramatic. If you look on YouTube there is lots of videos where he praises a country which dispite having the largest oil and minerals resources, its citizens are literally eating zoo animals and pets.
3626 2018-03-11 23:14:26 The fact that you checked your own oil, I give you respect.

3629 2018-03-11 23:14:06 Trudeau has no fucking  idea about many many things . He has never worked a full job in his life; knows nothing about guns, oil field, farm,ranch,reserves,small business,women,economics, budgets, middle/lower class and knows nothing about women.

3631 2018-03-11 23:13:49 So... Business analysts for the entire oil industry are wrong?
3632 2018-03-11 23:13:44 Britain civilized them Somalia also gave them Aid, then guess what happended Saudi shithole found Oil and spread it cancerous wahabism There's a reason that country is hated by everyone
3633 2018-03-11 23:13:43 This article is a demonstration of what a foul distrust I've and court place the United states is. Financing snake oil medicine so their lobbyists can make money through fraudulent actions. A nation well beyond any goodness.

3635 2018-03-11 23:13:41 Stunting oil production and increasing clean alternatives would be a positive.
3636 2018-03-11 23:13:35 How long before i should get a oil change ?
3637 2018-03-11 23:13:29 Prayers, lavender oil, and powdered magnesium.
3638 2018-03-11 23:13:26 Trump has had a 14 months to make good on his snake oil to these folks. The racists, homophobes, klan, etc. are all with him until the end of time. The rest are now looking for something more substantial. The new democratic paradigm rests with representing working people.
3639 2018-03-11 23:13:19 I marinated zucchini this morning and now I'm at uni and my hands will smell like garlic all day. It's a constant reminder what treasures I have waiting for me at home... thank you zucchini, thank you olive oil, thank you garlic, thank you.

3649 2018-03-11 23:10:53 Another point to consider: The IEA estimates that fuel efficiency standards are best way to reduce oil consumption between now and 2040. Also, tech advances like ignitionless ICE which raises thermal dynamic efficiency from 15% to 45%. Work the demand side, not the supply side.
3650 2018-03-11 23:10:49 I know you cannot do anything about what is happening, only the full strength of the US Military branches could, maybe, but that will mean WWWIII, and then no one wins... so we have to sit back and let Putin win by stealing the arctics vast oil and gas resources, etc.
3651 2018-03-11 23:10:41 Sounds weird but use oil. Vitamin E oil is one but search the others, put a few drops on your face after you tone it with Witch Hazel and moisturize

3662 2018-03-11 23:09:19 No, what I said was that by originally controlling supply and marketing they have kept the value in the stones. The violent history of the industry is no different than that of gold or even oil in the same time fame.

3667 2018-03-11 23:08:47 When they drive to protests and use kayaks(made from oil products) to complain about pipelines ... well, they’re doing it wrong.
3668 2018-03-11 23:08:46 It's what happens when you have no oil to offer the "free world"
3669 2018-03-11 23:08:45 no its definitely not by choice in many cases - its often just to get a job - and some were working for the British government - they took the case to court to try and get a vote - they are UK citizens - many folk working in Engineering & oil etc spend all their careers abroad
3670 2018-03-11 23:08:34 Even if we go green for energy (cars/homes), oil will still be extracted from the Earth. Perhaps in lesser quantities but prices for crude products will soar. Successful business dictates that costs/overhead needs to be covered (and more) by sales prices to stay in operation.
3671 2018-03-11 23:08:27 The IPO of Saudi Arabia's massive oil company could be delayed until 2019 at the earliest.
3672 2018-03-11 23:08:25 Ha...sounds like a cult member trying to talk a runaway back to the compound.

And gotta love he can't make it through one tweet without revealing himself...damn right not giving a snake oil salesman another chance to scam says something about ppl. That they're not fools.

3679 2018-03-11 23:07:30 Actually that’s smart . If oil isn’t hot enough when you deep fry then dough becomes oil soaked rather than crunchy fried goodness skin . A soggy churro is saddest thing in the world and limp despair even #bakingwithsarita #churrosmedtwitter

3688 2018-03-11 23:05:31 It’s a good thing we have oil and gas!!  Otherwise these morons could not have banners made. Talk about a waste of energy. Plus I don’t think many videos are made without oil and gas. #KinderMorgan

3691 2018-03-11 23:05:22 Stones glasshouse Clearly you have an agenda with @ChelseaFC this is not a club issue. I couldn’t care a less who they played for. This is completely disgusting from such a high profile person towards a young girl.

3694 2018-03-11 23:04:49 Oil?
3695 2018-03-11 23:04:45 finally got my hands on some rose hip oil
3696 2018-03-11 23:04:42 Chives and the green bits of spring onion for onion. Garlic infused oil instead of garlic. That's what I used when my daughter was on FODMAP diet.
3697 2018-03-11 23:04:26 Great! Now much needed CBD Oil won't cost an arm and a leg, crippling parents and patients financially! Here's hoping @nzgov FINALLY understands #Science aka cannabinoid receptors CB1 & CB2!!!
3698 2018-03-11 23:04:25 When you’re cooking and the oil pops out at you and burns you like damn I’m just tryna cook not get burned man bye
3699 2018-03-11 23:04:07 Oregano oil. Huff a couple drops in light steam 3 times a day for the next few days and you'll be good as new. And congratulations on the endorsement. We're rooting for you here in FL.
3700 2018-03-11 23:04:01 Literally: to sell oil
3701 2018-03-11 23:03:33 Mad #mothersday props to @FrancoMancaPizz #Dulwich today, great service and a present to leave with too - cupboard now has great sourdough, flour, chilli oil and more...
3702 2018-03-11 23:03:31 Opportunity cost of being left behind...oil will be displaced by electricity and EV technology. Are you suggesting Canada should become EV tech mfgers and that will compensate us for shutting down oil production?
3703 2018-03-11 23:03:11 Changing the oil in these damn fryers is so draining.

3705 2018-03-11 23:03:04 Pffft, it's not like #thejasonskenney demanded Notley shut off the flow of oil, or like Big D had a vague rambling press conference where he talked about how many other parties want him to join, THAT would be mayh-- 

Oh. 

I see.

3706 2018-03-11 23:02:59 So far so good. Chicken wings- excellent- dry rub only- no added oil at all. Earlier today I made french fries for me wife- She said they were good. I want to try salmon next time i have time to cook.
3707 2018-03-11 23:02:48 So gutted for you guys! More good things to come from @robertwickens without a doubt
3708 2018-03-11 23:02:44 I really want to get a oil painting of myself done.

3714 2018-03-11 23:01:41 Criticizing Alberta for producing its oil is the same as criticizing BC for producing lumber or Quebec for producing hydro power. Canada is a resource rich nation. It's what we do. And for better or for worse we've chosen private capital to exploit those resources.
3715 2018-03-11 23:01:33 It's a resource. Just like oil or minerals or metals.

He was proud of the both of them.

3725 2018-03-11 23:00:02 See, I disagree with the supply-side approach. Stopping a pipeline here will only mean a pipeline will pop up somewhere else to meet the demand Canada doesn't fill. Oil is with us for a long time yet.

3727 2018-03-11 22:59:40 Military, particularly Marines, are better with rifles (only w/in combat jobs). Pistols were in short supply and not valued as anything other than not-rifles until recently.

3734 2018-03-11 22:58:55 No other country is voluntarily reducing oil production. Any reduction of heavy oil production by Canada will simply be backfilled by a competitor. And there is no other heavy oil jurisdiction working as hard to de-carbonize as Alberta. Why penalize the good guys?

3774 2018-03-11 22:53:10 Natural Beauty Tip for Face Scrubber:- 

This is a great homemade scrub especially for tanned skin.

Pour honey and sugar in orange juice.

You can also add a few drops of olive oil.

Mix these ingredients well.

Apply all over the face and scrub in circular strokes.
3775 2018-03-11 22:52:55 friendly reminder that sugar snaps peas + olive oil + bit o garlic + med high heat + 4 minutes = extremely nutritious, nice iron, respectable chunk o protein
3776 2018-03-11 22:52:54 Lordt did I just rub lemon grass oil on my face cuz my face toner ran out?
3777 2018-03-11 22:52:47 I don't disagree with that premise but building new infrastructure to increase the export of carbon intensive oil at exactly the time we need to the opposite is not a path the kind of changes needed in the timeline required.
3778 2018-03-11 22:52:39 3/While EV tech progresses, the focus should be on de-carbonizing the oil economy as much as possible. That's why I support @RachelNotley climate policies and the efforts of the Alberta  industry to lower carbon-intensity of oil and gas.

3792 2018-03-11 22:50:27 2/We're already making good progress on de-carbonizing the power sector. Next focus should be buildings and energy efficiency. Mature, cost-effective technology already exists. Displacing oil requires electrification of transportation, and the tech is waaay too immature.
3793 2018-03-11 22:50:23 America has enough oil, but most don't even know it, yet.

3808 2018-03-11 22:47:57 Sick of hearing about supply & demand as reason for ludicrous gas prices.  They’re set high because Big Oil can & they stay high because of collusion (which is supposed to be illegal).  If Costco can sell gas 10c/L cheaper, everyone could. Don’t call it anything but greed.

3811 2018-03-11 22:47:22 We started an energy transition 10-15 years ago. We will be reducing our FF consumption over time. But the power sector will the first to de-carbonize. and transportation (70% of oil use) will be last. IMO, the emphasis should be on coal, then buildings and industry.

Look at total U.S. storage--close to 5 YA but stalled & may increase. Still, no evidence for a price collapse if that's what you're saying.
3815 2018-03-11 22:46:56 I'd argue you are as oil soaked as pipeline supporters. How do you think the clothes on your back and signs were made? I'm willing to bed you drove your vehicle but if you didn't, then did you ride your bike? Well that's made with oil too.

3835 2018-03-11 22:43:05 My team aspires to grow top shelf cannabis acknowledging that it is a small and discerning subset of the market. That said, in <3 years even price sensitive consumers will expect AAA. I am searching exhaustively, and cannot find a market for mids outside of oil feedstock.
3836 2018-03-11 22:41:55 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
3837 2018-03-11 22:41:41 I have a question, @DawnDish, you're telling me that you can make a product that can get oil off of a dainty baby duck, but you can't make a product to allow me to get the red out of my mommas Tupperware that I put spaghetti in?
3838 2018-03-11 22:41:38 Cbd oil would have you feeling better in no time seriously
3839 2018-03-11 22:41:35 You know @sjmuir if you start comparing you may regret it since safety regulations for oil and gas transport and restrictions are far more rigorous

3846 2018-03-11 22:40:46 Adrian from the point oil is sold, it takes 3-5 weeks to sale to an oil refinery, then has to be refined and then shipped as product to be sold. The benefit of oil prices in the last few weeks won’t hit the pumps for some time. This only part of the story as well

3850 2018-03-11 22:39:58 That's not entirely wrong. Everything is dependant on oil in one form or another. We aren't even close to an alternative yet. Electrical vehicle manufacturing for example still requires an extreme amount of oil. We can't go back because we still need oil to get away from oil.
3851 2018-03-11 22:39:57 Try baby oil!

3864 2018-03-11 22:38:12 It's not rocket science, it's economics. Please explain how shutting down TMX will not result in another heavy oil producing country filling the market left vacant by Canada? What if that country's heavy crude is far more carbon-intense than Alberta oil sands crude?

3874 2018-03-11 22:36:23 B) Trump is focused on coal, oil, & manufacturing. The rest of the world is looking to renewable energy, robotics, & education. Manufacturing jobs will continue to disappear with technology.  2/

    Renly wasn't eating that much.
Not only because he wasn't that hungry in general but also because he didn't want to know how old the oil was the fish and chips were made in.
    And also the ale. It was just kind hard to drink it.

3884 2018-03-11 22:33:32 Multiple tablespoons of coconut oil was my main fat source outside of that coming from protein. Tried to stick to around 50-80 grams protein per day. Carbs in the form of dark greens. Kale and spinach.  Carbs were around 10 to 15 grams. Occasionally a refeed to reset metabolism.
3885 2018-03-11 22:33:29 I smell like dry super glue, shredder oil, and magnetic tape. I think that vhs recorder is just going to have to be my tape ruining tool. Maybe dropping it from six inches up on the kitchen table will fix it? It might shake things loose enough to catch and run. Got 2 vcrs anyway.

3898 2018-03-11 22:31:39 How is your boxer “insane”, like uncontrollable hyper? I ask because my sister’s min pin goes crazy outside then comes in and has a seizure.  She asked her vet about CBD oil and the vet lost her mind.   I say if the vet can not diagnose or treat then why not try?

3901 2018-03-11 22:30:37 He's right, but is anyone going to care? Or do anything about it? Who is left in the GOP who gives a damn about anything but keeping power? Maybe 3 or 4 guys beyond the hustlers and snake oil salesmen making a buck before it all comes crashing down.

3947 2018-03-11 22:23:08 The main difference is that “petro” is a Venezuelan currency regulated by the state, this means that is the first cryptocurrency that works inside a central bank. Also is backed by minerals resources, such as oil, gas, diamond and gold.
3948 2018-03-11 22:23:06 Been on break and im reminded why i am glad i dont do cable tv anymore. There was a 15 minute long infomercial on a magical skin cream that supposedly gets rid of wrinkles. 15 minutes of unskippable snake oil! And advertisers wonder why ad block is so popular.
3949 2018-03-11 22:22:58 I just put on my tea tree oil. Whew
3950 2018-03-11 22:22:36 Really bad decision on their part, how will they keep oil prices this high for the next two years

3954 2018-03-11 22:21:55 Gas wasn’t even available in lots of areas in Portland, and electricity was absurdly cheap because of our salmon-killing “free” hydropower.

3961 2018-03-11 22:20:53 @walmarthelp three times in a row now I've gone to get my oil changed, left, and immediately had my check engine light on because my air hose is disconnected. It's getting really old, and I don't appreciate having to go back every time to get it fixed.

3964 2018-03-11 22:20:31 I’m in my shop making essential carrot oil. Well, the crockpot will make it over the next 48 hours but  moral of the story is I don’t have a social life 
3965 2018-03-11 22:20:16 Seize #uk ppl assets in #russia would be also great. Be sure to take over those #uk sharks in the oil ...
3966 2018-03-11 22:20:12 ok I'm gonna go wash all this oil out of my hair now and possibly cry a bunch in the bathtub (but in a good way, I mean because I'm really sad but because expressing emotions is apparently good for you)
3967 2018-03-11 22:20:06 I still checked the oil, cleared the auger, and topped up the gas.
3968 2018-03-11 22:20:02 Heat up olive oil over medium-low heat and add garlic and saute until aromatic. Add tomato paste and saute and stir and mix over heat until it becomes dark brick red in color (this sweetens it up and creates more complex flavor).
3969 2018-03-11 22:19:59 Looks like it might rain and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
3970 2018-03-11 22:19:46 Let me save u from the amount of oil u'll take in
3971 2018-03-11 22:19:45 Kinda makes you wonder how baby oil is made ... ewww
3972 2018-03-11 22:19:40 Prebiotics are good too, like bananas. Make a banana kefir shake. And add something like chia seeds or something with omega 3. You can also try seasoning food with sesame oil which has omega 3. And walks in nature. Tree therapy works.

3976 2018-03-11 22:18:50 I’ve always wanted to try nars but never have! I’ve got a mix of dry and more oil prone areas 
3977 2018-03-11 22:18:46 Another filthy lie! Little badly treated terriers are shoved into the boxes. Stuck inside all day long. Over rough terrain at high speeds. They only get dragged out to be shoved into the setts & entrances that the thick thugs have forgot or missed blocking with oil drums etc.
3978 2018-03-11 22:18:45 I’ve made myself some (legal) cbd balm using paste and coconut oil. Structurally workable, but I wish I’d paid better attention in science and not copied someone
3979 2018-03-11 22:18:19 Just got an obnoxious amount of hot oil on my arm and now I’m just don’t with this whole cooking thing for today.
3980 2018-03-11 22:18:07 The reason of first and second oil shock was Iran, how a country far from US can have such a impact on interest rate and economy.
3981 2018-03-11 22:18:03 i put my lash oil on before i dried my hair why am i like this
3982 2018-03-11 22:17:55 I need to take pictures and post my creations. Today I'm going to fry large breaded shrimp, hush puppies. tartar and cocktail sauce to dip into. Then. Saute' some organic mushrooms,green peas, with olive oil for a side.
3983 2018-03-11 22:17:41 Let me use my perfume oil and got to bed sniffing myself.

3986 2018-03-11 22:16:57 Steve Mnuchin on Meet the Press right now being asked about Trump calling Maxine Waters "low IQ" and other moments from his recent rally. Hard to watch as he tries to explain/condone this behavior.  Says the sanctions are working in NK. Really? Putin is ferrying oil, coal,

3988 2018-03-11 22:16:36 thought it was a motor oil
3989 2018-03-11 22:16:30 As much as I like Corbyn's ideals it's still a silly comparison....at least as a long term comparison. After all short term (before their economy crashed due to massive drop in oil prices) Venezuela did very well under Chavez
3990 2018-03-11 22:16:27 I got more baby oil on  
3991 2018-03-11 22:16:15 Ah shit i just got my oil changed ! I’m so broke i can’t even pay attention

3997 2018-03-11 22:15:34 No Venezuela is pegged to $ as it’s only industry is crude oil. Imports everything. Debts in dollars which it can’t print obvs. Zimbabwe was policy mis management : they destroyed a thriving agri economy entirely unrelated to fiat .
3998 2018-03-11 22:15:21 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
3999 2018-03-11 22:15:19 The essential oil candles from bath and body are amazing
4000 2018-03-11 22:15:18 Can report : you can sneak contact solution and valve oil through TSA but not Coca Cola. They took apart my backpack to find a book on chess, tampons, and a coke.
4001 2018-03-11 22:15:04 Trump fsmily doesnt understand ethics probe because they have no ethics. One is as exclusive of the other as oil and water. Just as they are incapable of moral values.  Very poor role models for young people to emulate. Disgusting.
4002 2018-03-11 22:14:59 Apparently  Chad has oil and more !!!!
4003 2018-03-11 22:14:50 Yeah.... Why not
4004 2018-03-11 22:14:50 You agents would know a lot about disgusting behaviour
4005 2018-03-11 22:14:45 ‘beard oil’ is such a repulsive phrase to me it’s probably gonna be my next safe word
4006 2018-03-11 22:14:43 Dave, AN needs leadership. The only leader standing up for AB Gay friendly Oil is JK. Notley has been ordered by her head office to stop the pipeline. Kent Hehr has abandoned AB. Dave, we need a leader. Fly to the front line and get onto the fight.
4007 2018-03-11 22:14:31 This speech was the ramblings of a madman an unstable man in on secure man hey snake oil salesman somebody that can’t be trusted just listening to him reminds me of somebody that is totally off their medicine
4008 2018-03-11 22:14:20 Saying "Institutional order flow" is just the biggest orders means you either don't know what it is or you are a snake oil salesman pretending you have insider secrets, not a pro.  It's just supply and demand, same as the chart patterns show.
4009 2018-03-11 22:14:12 Allah cire mana son rai amin
4010 2018-03-11 22:13:49 Depends on the brand, also check ingredients for crappy oil as well as sugar.
4011 2018-03-11 22:13:36 Not at all.  It's more like the history teacher using a book when she doesn't know the intricate details of how the pages are printed or how the covers are produced.  Or the mechanic who doesn't know every ingredient or property by memory in the engine oil they're changing.
4012 2018-03-11 22:13:35 Where did you buy mist of your food? Grass fed beef, oil free dressing, etc...
4013 2018-03-11 22:13:11 No Fightin' Irish, but Oklahoma, who has been leaking oil for a month in a half did. Hmm. #SelectionSunday
4014 2018-03-11 22:13:06 Afrin may be more peaceful than Cizre or other cantons but that isn't the Turkish thinking itis their strategic defense. An example?See Japans attack on Perl on 1941 on the USA the attack was made cause due tothe US embargo had oil reserves for about a year left..Defensive attack
4015 2018-03-11 22:12:59 No worries. I'd rather that instead of coal pollution in the air, dredging The Great Barrier Reef to transport coal, oil spills etc etc etc
4016 2018-03-11 22:12:55 Preach sister 
4017 2018-03-11 22:12:52 I only use heat in my hair from November to May. Unless I'm under the dryer deep conditioning/hot oil treatment.
4018 2018-03-11 22:12:51 Went to get my oil changed and they told me I need all this other stuff done. Now I don’t even want the car.
4019 2018-03-11 22:12:29 Curry was bought by big oil and then released from Ga Tech for taking a Pruitt attitude towards #AGW

4021 2018-03-11 22:12:02 Even with the help of British ‘advisers and bombs’ MBS can’t get that pesky war to steal the Yemeni oil finished on schedule, looks like he was in London to ‘drum up’ extra support, expect more ‘private military contractors’ and ‘specialty weapons’.

4025 2018-03-11 22:11:19 You can relate ba
4026 2018-03-11 22:10:47 There is such a thing as OMG TOO MUCH TEA TREE OIL to use in your homemade floor cleaner. I've discovered it. I can TASTE this smell.
4027 2018-03-11 22:10:40 
4028 2018-03-11 22:10:30 James, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
4029 2018-03-11 22:10:27 Oil too
4030 2018-03-11 22:10:14 HD mgmt plus his own obsession with repeating the same formula and never letting go of the oil-in-frame, peripheral rotor etc...

4032 2018-03-11 22:10:06 I mixed bee pollen in an avacodo oil+ protein face mask i used yesterday and man ive never had such a natural glow.
4033 2018-03-11 22:10:03 Ghost blowjob is now henceforth slang for masturbating with peppermint oil
4034 2018-03-11 22:09:56 So stupid. That's why Trump allowed sale of offensive weapons to Ukraine, killed hundreds of Russians in Syria, opened more land to gas&oil exploitation reducing Russia's influence in the oil market &its profits? Obama hadn't done it. Perhaps Obama was Russian asset?
4035 2018-03-11 22:09:56 my hairdresser replied btw and basically said its normal after a big process and its good that there's no bad breakage. she recommended i start using hair masks, but she was happy i was using argan oil for the dryness :o
im just gonna try not to stress about my hair uhfjdsklmf
4036 2018-03-11 22:09:55 I saw that...snake oil in human form.
4037 2018-03-11 22:09:47 All I have is maple and brown sugar oatmeal atm but maybe I should try to pick up some plain oats tomorrow.
I used a tea tree oil soap so hopefully that will help dry it up a bit. We'll see.
4038 2018-03-11 22:09:42 Deep condition it a lot!! Wash it every other day and wear LOTS of coconut oil it’ll get better! Lol

4040 2018-03-11 22:09:33 If by star you mean corrupt and endangering millions of lives in favor of oil & gas company profits then yes that’s your man - the most infamous EPA administrator in history - a man so evil some coal companies are embarrassed to meet with him

4042 2018-03-11 22:09:18 Warm water to wet your face, almond oil to remove makeup, wipe off with cotton pads, use your final gentle cleanser of choice (I like 9-5 from lush). Use a washcloth if you like gentle physical exfoliation.
4043 2018-03-11 22:09:12 i would rather drink canola oil than do any of my homework right now
4044 2018-03-11 22:09:09 I'm certainly not using lines from oil lobbyists. And I am informed. 
Still waiting for you to answer my question.
4045 2018-03-11 22:09:09 Translation: No way we are making our finances public because we know there are plenty of idiots in the oil market who'll buy if we jawbone. Why would we lose that? Plus we are playing the oil market for fools anyway so no way we are going public.....
4046 2018-03-11 22:09:07 He spat disgustingly, aggressively towards a 14 yr old Girl. It’s disgraceful behaviour towards a child from anyone, especially from such a public figure #Disgusting #YourFired
4047 2018-03-11 22:08:20 Yet they never seem to question the SNP about anything; during #indyref they never questioned YeSNP on currency, fiscal planning, oil revenues, pensions, EU membership—it was almost as if they were too scared to question anything.
4048 2018-03-11 22:08:20 Actually the salve works great as do the oils.  If you get Hemp CBD oil, very little THC.   I know how she feels about pot.   In the 1970's in Austin, I got some laced with something!  It was awful.
4049 2018-03-11 22:08:03 I lived through the one time during the Oil Crisis of 1973 when Michigan extended DST through December. On west edge of East zone. Went to school in the dark past 9 am. There were accidents with kids waiting for buses. Switched back next year

4051 2018-03-11 22:07:55 Hopefully it would teach him that our #military no longer fights noble wars. Those days have been over for decades. We don't "fight for freedom." We fight for oil, money, and war contractors, under the guise of #freedom. It's sad that they are brainwashing/killing so many kids.

4054 2018-03-11 22:07:37 Sounds very Southern.... almost east Texas draw?

I will catch myself doing the same.

4057 2018-03-11 22:06:58 I use it as a shaving cream, Luv it , tip * mixed with rose hip oil then shave beard / hair , rinse with lukewarm water  & use it in shower mixed with Pai exfoliator , follow up with tonic & moisturizer 
4058 2018-03-11 22:06:56 Thanks, I’ve been feeling lately I’m going extra mad! 
We’ve still to get the defence scare, the oil part2 scare, 
The ‘you’re too thick’ scare, the currency scare etc.

4060 2018-03-11 22:06:27 Sundays are honestly for full body oil massages and strokes while Ringo plays in the background.
4061 2018-03-11 22:06:13 Because perv-stench still covers Bill Clinton like an oil slick, the Dems find him too toxic to campaign in midterms.

Need #MeToo women VS Trump.  Don't want Clinton anywhere near the mids.
4062 2018-03-11 22:06:13 There is nothing I hate more on this green Earth than the feeling of oil on my face. Not to be dramatic or anything but I could give my car an oil change with the amount of oil on my face

4071 2018-03-11 22:05:13 So no president has met with North Korea’s Dictator, how has that worked out for us.  They received food, oil, billions of dollars and time to develop nuclear weapons.  All of the other POTUS didn’t legitimize NK.  I’m impressed.

4075 2018-03-11 22:05:00 Any oil based makeup remover is the best. Banilaco do one that's available on Hikoco and cliniques take the day off balm is lovely, but pricey. Both rinse clean and don't leave an oily film. I still follow up with another cleanser to get remnants tho.
4076 2018-03-11 22:04:58 random thought: 5-10 years from now i hope to have a husband that wants to put oil on my scalp. 
4077 2018-03-11 22:04:37 The most underrated, underutilized oil is #sesameoil. Such powerful flavor! Do you use it in home cooking? Regular or toasted sesame oil? 
4078 2018-03-11 22:04:27 brought him a six pack of beer and some chainsaw bar oil... 'cause, well, what do you buy the guy who kills everything?

She holds it out for him, one in each hand, the beer in a carrying case and the bar oil still in the packaging. "Hey, thought I'd drop by annnnnnnd...." (c)

4082 2018-03-11 22:03:48 So you're ok with the oil going in a tanker, just not in "your" ocean (i.e. Your shoreline) . The NIMBYism of your argument is shining through.

4084 2018-03-11 22:03:27 Too early to tell- they "cherry pick" examples- at this point in history/evolution regardless of who is, will be in office - the Era of Growth is over- Population, Energy/resources, peak oil, Trillions in debt (can't be repaid), Ecological issues- a New Normal/Paradigm upon us
4085 2018-03-11 22:03:11 Patrick, what is your choice?  Please tell @vancouverpride that you wish to enrich dictators from regimes that toss  off Buildings instead of selling Canada’s Gay friendly Oil.

4111 2018-03-11 21:59:54 Need input about THC!! Has anyone made butter/oil? If so I need suggestions.. The Yes and No's...
Asking for a friend!
4112 2018-03-11 21:59:50 Just in:
Exxon plans to build an oil drilling bridge between Boston and Dunquin, Dingle Peninsula, Ireland. "It will make logistics easier and tolls will pay for the bridge in five years."
4113 2018-03-11 21:59:37 อย่าสร้างภาพ จนรู้สึกว่าตัวเองลำบาก
4114 2018-03-11 21:59:32 1. Things are only worth what people will pay for them. As the article says, nobody wants Alberta Bitumen now that cleaner Oil is available from fracking. So, right now, bitumen has little value. Alberta will now have to wait until all of the possible fracking has been done.
4115 2018-03-11 21:59:28 เนาะ
4116 2018-03-11 21:59:09 OK ma'am
4117 2018-03-11 21:59:02 If u ever go to jiffy lube get an oil change. Just an oil change, ya car will thank u
4118 2018-03-11 21:58:54 Canada has little influence on the price of oil. We import half of the oil we consume. Gas prices don’t affect me in the least—I drive an electric vehicle.
4119 2018-03-11 21:58:31  My bf can't beat my friend na, he knows I have male friends. So next time I'll be expecting ya.
4120 2018-03-11 21:58:21 Two things happening with his base. They were sold a bad bill of goods from a mob friendly snake oil salesman. They are either embarassed & won’t admit it OR too dumb to see they were used as marks to elect a puppet of some nefarious.
4121 2018-03-11 21:57:58 I wonder if Gabe Kapler is going to be absent from the game tonight and spotted in the locker room bathroom with an industrial sized vat of coconut oil after the Arrieta signing.
4122 2018-03-11 21:57:54 Got oil in my eye and I feel like I’m goin blind
4123 2018-03-11 21:57:52 We think it’s the same oil they cook the french toast sticks in. The cheese sauce was weird.
4124 2018-03-11 21:57:36 I just had a cereal bar, a cupcake, hard candy, gummies, a drink and an a shot of oil all with weed in it. Good luck to me
4125 2018-03-11 21:57:33 I was thinking about what would happen if another country developed solar so Good they didn’t need oil or coal.  Gas prices would go down and we would prosper, catching up over following 5-20 years.   I like your thought of us being a leader though.

4129 2018-03-11 21:56:41 $HPNN  rating for the @cedarbrands oil verified purchase. That’s awesome!!! #cedarbrands #amazon
4130 2018-03-11 21:56:41 Ginsters..proud to use local or British ingredients ?  How about Palm oil ?  Why on earth would anyone use that crap..especially in a " Cornish "  Pasty ?
4131 2018-03-11 21:56:32 LETS PLAY A GAME!! take a shot every time you’re blocked by a snowrat/oil city/or dp stan you’ve never heard of 
4132 2018-03-11 21:56:22 Oil not having content?! Unheard of!
4133 2018-03-11 21:56:21 Here's an unpopular opinion:
I hate, hate Luce. Their crust is so bad that it can never justify their various topping stunts. Had Parkway just once and got a bit ill from the extra oil, but tasted good.
4134 2018-03-11 21:56:19 Probably the same photographer who was lucky enough to catch the San Juan mayor hand distributing relief supplies from a boat.
4135 2018-03-11 21:56:15 and your rally paid for by @OilsandsAction funded by oil companies
4136 2018-03-11 21:56:12 Oil demand does not increase every year. Evidence that it is levelling off in part due to China’s massive investment in high speed rail. Many people are tired of breathing the deadly air pollution caused by burning oil and are demanding clean solutions.
4137 2018-03-11 21:56:06 Tell you what John. We will just keep all of our oil and you keep your £70bn. Deal?
4138 2018-03-11 21:56:03 Lol ,so that ur bf will beat me abi
4139 2018-03-11 21:56:01 The royalties from my book paid for an oil change. True story.
4140 2018-03-11 21:55:43 I'm trying to convince my mother that she should try cannabis oil or something that won't make her high but will make her have energy and feel better. She won't listen to me either.
4141 2018-03-11 21:55:35 But we haven’t necessarily seen that trend. As oil prices have remained low, gas prices have trended upward. The question is how do we move away from being so damn dependent on fossil fuels?
4142 2018-03-11 21:55:25 I got to know him when he was MT AG and I was US Attorney working on crime and environmental issues coming out of Bakken Oil Boom.  He has governed well as a D in a Red State.  A lot to like there!
4143 2018-03-11 21:55:21 #4 SPOT TREATMENT

Witch hazel - (soak cotton pad and apply to problematic areas)

Tea tree oil - wet cotton pad with water and add 2-3 drops, apply

Apple cider vinegar - Wer cotton pad with water, add 1-2 drops, apply.
4144 2018-03-11 21:55:18 I want some CBD Oil. I think it will help my bipolar. 

No chance here in nanny state Australia though.
4145 2018-03-11 21:55:16 this hot oil treatment 
4146 2018-03-11 21:55:16 Google knows best sometimes. If I were you I'd check my oil next time before starting my car....
4147 2018-03-11 21:55:13 Peppermint oil!  I usually just rub peppermint oil on any muscles that are sore
4148 2018-03-11 21:55:09 When Lizzo said "I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some COCONUT OIL " I really felt that.
4149 2018-03-11 21:55:06 You think oil is the future? Oh dear. Why do you think Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its economy? And do you really believe the UK economy is built on oil?
4150 2018-03-11 21:54:52 Yessss, you didn't take me along wen u wanted to watch yours.
4151 2018-03-11 21:54:40 1. The important role Proctors play in college entrance exams.
2. The legacy of the discovery of crude oil in regard to its positive and negative effects on society and the environment.

4155 2018-03-11 21:53:35 I will be redoing shortly - I guess after that I can decide if  I need to up or down sat fats ! :)   The sugar/ flour/ seed oil/ processed food combo is long banished - my worst being the occasional  bowl of rice or a bit of mashed potato!
4156 2018-03-11 21:53:30 about your budget , where did the money come from ?  citizens or  oil companies , foreign?
4157 2018-03-11 21:53:16 My mom is now in a nursing home but she did the low thc Cannabis oil and it helped her a lot. And she is a tea drinking straight lace. Keep at her.
4158 2018-03-11 21:53:15 the news is in and it's good: i will soon run out of all my facemasks, hand cream, hair oil and shower stuff, which means i will HAVE to make a trip to bodyshop to restock >:)
4159 2018-03-11 21:53:10 Yo u need better oil if u need more than 1 drop for a single sacrament cup
4160 2018-03-11 21:53:02 El nuevo Fiscal tendrâ un arduo trabajo. Correa y su gallada pusieron a Ivonne Fabara, como Directora de Hidrocarburos; pero antes, trabajó en Worley Parsons y Azúl. Les entregó a Gente Oil, El campo SINGUE, manejada por hija de W. Pàstor.@Lenin
4161 2018-03-11 21:52:56 They realised they'll need to tell us how little oil they both actually have left
4162 2018-03-11 21:52:50 I love that shit! The in shower body oil is amazing too.
4163 2018-03-11 21:52:49 I don't say perfume, as it genders the issue. And also b/c almost everyone wears some sort of fragrance or scent due to grooming products.  

In addition to my meds(rescue& regular), find that eucalyptus oil helps to counteract most fragrances & me breathe. I negotiate this also.
4164 2018-03-11 21:52:34 I like that term Snake oil demagogue. Can I use it?
4165 2018-03-11 21:52:18 Just wanna moisturize my life with coconut oil.
4166 2018-03-11 21:51:51 You gotta love these hypocritical ‘green’ pricks that live off the benefits of oil Monday to Friday, and protest on weekends....there is nothing noble about undermining Canada......
4167 2018-03-11 21:51:49 @WhatsGabyCookin Hi! Did you recently do a “crack” sauce with garlic and olive oil? Or am I dreaming? I can’t find it. Thank you!!!
4168 2018-03-11 21:51:18 @oil_shaeikh a ina take?
4169 2018-03-11 21:51:12 also oil
4170 2018-03-11 21:51:01 Big Oil and Big Money Lobbyists in Pharmaceutical, Oil, Insurance etc gives big to the candidates that are going to do their bidding. If we don't learn from history your condemned to repeat it.
4171 2018-03-11 21:50:54  I know! And I just ran out of heating oil!  (It'll be delivered tomorrow) 
4172 2018-03-11 21:50:51 Listening to old oil field stories over a brew with the Old Man cant be beat
4173 2018-03-11 21:50:48 Coconut oil for all!
4174 2018-03-11 21:50:48 Dats wat happens wen one tries to mix water n oil
4175 2018-03-11 21:50:45 Buying an essential oil diffuser, coffee mugs, face masks, fake succulents, and almond milk at Target. I literally cannot white girl any harder 
4176 2018-03-11 21:50:45 There's no reason to ever believe a word out of your mouth. The fact that millions do anyway is a tribute to your skill as a snake oil salesman. That is your one and only true talent.
4177 2018-03-11 21:50:41 It’s SOOO good and it doesn’t give workers cancer. When I finally just give up I’ll use palm oil every time
4178 2018-03-11 21:50:23 Lol kaidai bari
4179 2018-03-11 21:50:21 I'm that guy. I was in Home Depot and asked where the car parts were. He said this is Home Depot. I said so where is the oil? I left with no oil
4180 2018-03-11 21:50:08 The biggest difference it that Petro is launched by the government, and it's also backed up by commodities as oil or gas, so if we analyze it, it would be easier to manipulate than other cryptocurrencies because it will be centralized by the government of Venezuela (intermediary)
4181 2018-03-11 21:49:56 Man I love snacking on raw broccoli and maybe sardines covered in olive oil - perfect road trip food
4182 2018-03-11 21:49:55 Also I drank cooking oil thinking it was juice...
4183 2018-03-11 21:49:48 go straight past the coal mine to the church teaching school and then take a right at the whale oil processing plant
4184 2018-03-11 21:49:48 TMP will be transporting oil sands oil. If they are against Tar Sand oil, they should be protesting California Tar Sands  extraction and transporting of it. Oh wait. The Americans don’t want you to protest there oil, just Canadian oil. 1-TMP 2-Northern Gateway 3-Keystone
4185 2018-03-11 21:49:29 Makes sense that me.  But I believe we need to educate people on the difference between the 70’s pot and 2010’s pot.  Also between CBD oil and THC chemicals.  One is good, the other is not.  We need to change laws to outlaw harmful uses!!
4186 2018-03-11 21:49:19 Your head get oil. #BBNaija
4187 2018-03-11 21:48:50 Me and trains are like water and oil
4188 2018-03-11 21:48:37 Not only oil $. The UN sucks up to 1.5 billion Muslims. Think about how many Muslim countries need UN help compared to Christian or Jewish countries. Besides the UN is still POed that Jerusalem & Bethlehem were not internationalized for UN control.

4191 2018-03-11 21:48:18 Done right, distributed ledgers can help keep our identities private & secure. #Blockchain will be the replay of the crypto wars. "Data is the new oil, but also the new oil spill." @brianbehlendorf @AmberBaldet #SXSW2018

4193 2018-03-11 21:48:07 大丈夫だよ◎
4194 2018-03-11 21:48:05 That’s not oil tho. That’s maple syrup.
4195 2018-03-11 21:47:52 The way I usually look at a refurb is like this. It was broken and they fixed the issue. A used car may have an oil leak and then that oil leak may have been fixed, but how long was that person driving it with the leak for? How many other issues did the car have due to the leak?
4196 2018-03-11 21:47:52 Doesn't matter. Russia has been supplying North Korea w/ missile technology ass well as oil. Putin probably told Kim to placate Trump for a couple of years, until he's kicked out of office, before he decides to blow up the planet --just to see what an atomic blast is like.
4197 2018-03-11 21:47:51 .@ConnieJ4OK I think we're at a pivotal spot in history where we can revolutionize our energy needs and power grid. For the 1st time even coming from an oil family. I see more potential to make more money in #GreenEnergy do you see an avenue to push for green energy?

4208 2018-03-11 21:45:34 Now that is really beautiful - oil rigs in the Pacific Ocean are not. Hands off Shitler
4209 2018-03-11 21:45:31 Nothing beats a long hot shower && then a good skin oiling with sleep oil and the lotion 
4210 2018-03-11 21:45:29 and if you were to replace the existing Oil, Gas, Coal based electricity supply by nuclear, you’d be mobilising 335mt of concrete (a minor part of the total emissions) => massive CO2 footprint for new plants => time to look for alternatives, no?
4211 2018-03-11 21:45:27 Don't disagree, however, smartest countries will move beyond oil as quickly as they can.
4212 2018-03-11 21:45:26 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4213 2018-03-11 21:45:26 I’m supposed to be getting an oil change but I’m at apple bees drinking margaritas 
4214 2018-03-11 21:45:26 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4215 2018-03-11 21:45:15 I need an oil change
4216 2018-03-11 21:44:16 lol I haven’t found any that last through grease/oil 
4217 2018-03-11 21:44:06 I wonder if it's Canadian oil..or that Saudi stuff...if it's Saudi it would explain why we didn't hear about it or why #greenpeace isn't out there saying look at us

4219 2018-03-11 21:43:45 Personally I feel like I was baptized in coronas & instead of tracing a cross with oil they just squeezed a fucking lime on my head
4220 2018-03-11 21:43:44 why electric? Are you against gun turrets or boiling oil? The Rio Grand used to be enough until someone went down to border and gave swimming lessons

4230 2018-03-11 21:42:38 Please, she yells IMPEACH! every time Trump farts. Can you imagine when dementia sets in?
 Grandkid: Gramma, would you like some  peaches w/lunch?
Maxine: What? Oh yes, IMPEACH HIM!! IMPEACH HIM!!
Grandkid: Damnit, I should've offered her pears.
4231 2018-03-11 21:42:33 Bring it! The oil B.C. gets from Alberta is now a mere trickle. Kinder Morgan exports over 80% to the U.S. The big losers, if Alberta WERE able to turn off the taps: 1) Kinder Morgan, 2) Alberta.  #Ain’tGonnaHappen
4232 2018-03-11 21:42:24 Most definitely - trade skills cannot be done by robots - we will always need humans skilled to put water systems into homes, install well pumps, engineer septic systems, window installation, plumbing and heating repair & installation, not to mention propane and oil truck drivers
4233 2018-03-11 21:42:17 @SchaefferOil Hello, do you offer 2cyl mixing oil?

4238 2018-03-11 21:41:49 many themes are constant from last week. Waiting for clear sign of $ bottom (although may have seen that in the yen already). Equities to fall over, bonds to rally hard, a deflation leg is under way & risk assets look to get crushed. Oil  gonna get beat & natgas looking tasty
4239 2018-03-11 21:41:41 The learning curve is too long for some ppl @sunfolk -they are listening to @FairQuestions and other oil industry shills

4241 2018-03-11 21:41:18 It's not really a secret that servicemembers - and even police - are for the most part not proficient with pistols. The best shooters out there, especially from concealed carry, are civilian enthusiasts. This isn't hard.
4242 2018-03-11 21:40:58 What is the difference between refunded coconut oil and unrefined coconut oil help meeee
4243 2018-03-11 21:40:55 I normally use olive oil on my blenders but I totally didn’t think to use my DHC cleansing oil
4244 2018-03-11 21:40:41 Well abadi did a really cool thing, he set up a state oil company with every iraqi citizen having a share in it, that way we all have a share in the oil
4245 2018-03-11 21:40:39 This morning: god I'm tired. I'm taking it easy today.

3 loads of laundry, 1 pot pie, a pancake breakfast, a dozen apple cinnamon scones, oil change, food shopping, two sinks of dishes cleaned and one trip to the bookstore later...

All I got is dinner to be made.
4246 2018-03-11 21:40:22 You are right! I burn too much #fossilfuels and want options not to. I do some things that cost me and am willing to pay more to protect the planet. We can't kill all oil, but will kill the planet soon at current rate.
4247 2018-03-11 21:40:15 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。

4250 2018-03-11 21:39:55 @DanRDimicco For all those willing to write off our American steel & aluminum industries, think about oil & gas. Had we decided to  import all our oil and gas, we would now be at the mercy of Russia, Venezuela, & OPEC. Greenhouse gasses much reduced now due to clean natural gas.
4251 2018-03-11 21:39:48 I recommend coconut oil slip-n-slides
4252 2018-03-11 21:39:34 Which is why supertankers or increased tanker traffic mean an oil spill in BC would be inevitable!#NoTankers @JustinTrudeau
4253 2018-03-11 21:39:17 you have to mobilize on both sides you do not want the Mexicans there we want to get our oil and our water back that they stole from us and I'm sure we'll be good neighbors
4254 2018-03-11 21:38:59 Mass adoption is the last thing we need to happen right now. The huge oil industry would collapse causing untold economic damage to jobs and quite frankly the EV infrastructure would explode. It needs to be a gradual change over organically, not a huge transfer overnight.

4256 2018-03-11 21:38:49 my transmission fluid is leaking into my oil (:
4257 2018-03-11 21:38:30 Why is it every Anthropologie employee looks like they’re about to try to convince my wife and I to start selling YoungLiving oils and tell me how they have the perfect essential oil to cure my stress. BTW, these rugs would look really good in my Yurt. #yurtlife #essentialoils
4258 2018-03-11 21:38:28 @Walmart three times in a row now I've gotten my oil changed at your tire and lube and three times in a row I leave and my check engine light comes on because my air hose is disconnected. Is there no system in place to check this? I'm paying almost $70 for the service...

4268 2018-03-11 21:36:57 Let me tell you how I know tsa is full of shit. How was I allowed to travel out of FLL with body oil in my purse but when I’m leaving IAD all of a sudden y’all gotta pull me out the line over the same bottle of oil

4271 2018-03-11 21:35:59 Really glad I converted from an oil furnace to a heat pump for my Depression Bungalow.
4272 2018-03-11 21:35:56 You mean buy super delegates, deregulate banks and build oil pipelines don't you?
4273 2018-03-11 21:35:53 Light sesame oil eh? I wanna drip this over a nice young lady’s backside. Yup.
4274 2018-03-11 21:35:35 Between 2003 and 2008, alot of the money was also used to recruit locals in anbar to fight off alqaeda since we had no money to spend, remember oil prices were like $170 pb, yet, we had no money so america dipped into that trillion to recruit anbaries

4278 2018-03-11 21:35:30 Safaree's writing skills suck, he now sells coconut oil. Delete this
4279 2018-03-11 21:35:24 I have super dry skin so I use aveeno makeup wipes to make sure I remove all eye makeup just be gentle and for my actual face I use coconut oil rub it everywhere then wet the hands and rub the oil until it's milky and rinse pat dry it helps with the dryness it works wonders
4280 2018-03-11 21:34:59 MCT oil makes my brain happy
4281 2018-03-11 21:34:44 Corrupt governments to start with.
4282 2018-03-11 21:34:41 mas isso qualquer outro óleo faz, né? E C acaba pagando mais caro no bio oil
4283 2018-03-11 21:34:37 Nah, just being lazy. Besides, I have to get my oil changed tomorrow so it doesn't really matter at the moment
4284 2018-03-11 21:34:35 As if my day could get any worse...... we've ran out of oil 
4285 2018-03-11 21:34:26 Who is briefing @donnabrazile on inner workings?
4286 2018-03-11 21:33:49 Castor oil! They’ll grow back in no time
4287 2018-03-11 21:33:47 Just had to sit in the tire/oil change place for 2 hours and pay $300. #adulting 
4288 2018-03-11 21:33:36 and it beats heating up oil...

4290 2018-03-11 21:33:14 You know Canada and USA have to refine Venezuelan oil because Canada can’t export its oil right?  So your pro Venezuela?  Congrats on that.
4291 2018-03-11 21:32:46 I have to write a 4 page paper on olive oil. Wtffff

4293 2018-03-11 21:32:28 Wait, what are those bottles of vegetable oil for?
4294 2018-03-11 21:32:21 Part is the 'negative' economy of the pursuits. Oil cleanup, landslides from erosion due to clearcutting and their cleanup. Water/creek cleanup.
4295 2018-03-11 21:32:18 It really is. Went in for an oil change and left with 4 new tires and a few other things done. Not cheap. Hope you’re doing well, Lyanne!
4296 2018-03-11 21:31:56 This tea tree oil got my skin looking good
4297 2018-03-11 21:31:53 Walmart takes forever to do an oil change. I just wanna get back to school before all the parking spots are gone

4302 2018-03-11 21:31:09 Oil? Boycott that.
4303 2018-03-11 21:31:08 Oh, I think I do.
Even ones much newer do.
Oil leaks, whether in pipelines or backyard tanks.
4304 2018-03-11 21:30:37 The industrialized world to include the EU and China is committing to renewable energy to include solar meanwhile @realdonaldtrump is committing our nation to coal. What's next, whale oil?

4314 2018-03-11 21:29:38 Years ago he complained the price still high when oil prices were lower and I believe the airlines just disregarded the issue:they control the air.

4318 2018-03-11 21:28:53 While humanity worries about AI, wars, oil, selfie sticks, organic kale,

Yellowstone volcano is due for an eruption and turn the climate into a nuclear winter.

Last time it erupted, 85% of land species & 95% of ocean species were killed.

#YellowStone
4319 2018-03-11 21:28:39 Yep! And like, if they ever even did that they'd see that, even for its faults, its a more ecologically sustainable model than the Nordic one of "lets pump oil and sell weapons"

4322 2018-03-11 21:28:04 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
4323 2018-03-11 21:27:49 And usually before I wash I put a bunch of coconut oil in my hair and leave it in overnight, wash and dry/style in he morning.
4324 2018-03-11 21:27:44 88 dollars?????????? i’d just use jamaican castor oil and keep it pushing 
4325 2018-03-11 21:27:27 
4326 2018-03-11 21:27:20 Agree with all of the thread, but in my opinion oils economical and geopolitical importance will be overtaken by Quantum Computing, whoever gets there first will make monumental oil revenues and political leverage look tiny, Russia and China are up there with the US in the race!
4327 2018-03-11 21:27:08 Bernie's a fraud. I really do wish his supporters would look behind the curtain to see that their emporer is just a snake oil salesman.
4328 2018-03-11 21:27:01 Really? It seems that using more gas and oil will lead to less peace on earth.
4329 2018-03-11 21:26:50 Amazing. No wonder Trump called for an IQ test.

4336 2018-03-11 21:25:32 Planning on doing my tan tonight but I’ve just remembered that we’ve no oil in our house so no heating. It’ll be cold endurance tanning then so.
4337 2018-03-11 21:25:08 it will look like an oil slick

4344 2018-03-11 21:24:45 Okay so as a fellow bright haired friend, here is the T: wash your hair no more often than once every five days, load yourself with leave in conditioner when you get out and touch up with Argon oil every couple of days as your hair starts to look dry again.
4345 2018-03-11 21:24:37 Apparently evening primrose oil is good
4346 2018-03-11 21:24:21 I think having the ref will in itself change the mood. #indyref 2014, was a needed step on the road, now Scotland does understand, currency, oil, gers, more - so there are 1.6 million willing to debate, rather than a couple of thousand before
4347 2018-03-11 21:24:18 Can someone please remind me tomorrow that I need to buy cooking oil, I keep forgetting
4348 2018-03-11 21:24:13 Anyone know which essential oil will help with the three papers I have due this week?
4349 2018-03-11 21:23:48 Oil got me sleepy
4350 2018-03-11 21:23:40 Yes, lets take a look at Texas. Dallas is blue and Houston is blue. Two oil business cities. Whose got what for brain again?
4351 2018-03-11 21:23:21 Because government estimates are that demand for oil will increase for several more decades before tapering. Accelerate renewables absolutely, but solar and wind don't replace oil. Better cleaner American energy (our oil and gas production is cleaner too) than Russian imports.
4352 2018-03-11 21:23:12 The new furnace is in.
The oil tank is a leftover, but might still need a Bobcat job.
4353 2018-03-11 21:23:07 The very fact that you didn't accept any of my sources and say they were biased, even when it didn't make sense. Bruce Anderson's daughter being in Trudeau's govt, when Trudeau has been saying over and over again he supports Alberta oil exports makes you stubborn.

4356 2018-03-11 21:22:56 Please open your eyes. Trump is the same Trump he was 15- 20 years ago. A snake oil salesman. Unfortunately most people heard of him for the first time on the Apprentice. Sadly that tough persona is just a part he plays.
4357 2018-03-11 21:22:55 Honey is the best conditioner I've ever used!! I mix it with normal conditioner and/or olive oil, leave it in for a few hours, wash it out in the shower and my hair is sooo soft.

4366 2018-03-11 21:21:10 He demonstrates every day that he's not his father. Justin is too beholden to his "1%" buddies. His father could have given a shit what they thought. His father would let BC discover just how dependent on Oil our society is. That's what he did to Ontario.
4367 2018-03-11 21:21:05 Getting a haircut is the equivalent of going to the spa and getting some warm oil body message. I’m relaxed and ready for bed. Am I weird? 
4368 2018-03-11 21:21:01 And ppl in many places associate fracking w earthquakes. Fracked oil is harder to clean up when spilled. Uses a LOT of water, and the waste is not monitored.
4369 2018-03-11 21:20:58 That was also my biggest pet peeve of the 2016 election cycle! I was absolutely disgusted by the way the press treated Trump. The squeaky wheel does get the grease, but the press was giving Trump the entire refinery and oil fields! They were like deer in the headlights and Trump
4370 2018-03-11 21:20:55 The Tory Party has sold its soul to the snake oil salesman that is nationalism.

Scrap it, install a heat pump.
4372 2018-03-11 21:20:46 Do you get a kick out of telling falsehoods you lying rat. Venezuelans are starving because of dodgy leadership, artificially low oil prices and tough sanctions imposed. If you want a look at benefits of socialism without oil interference look at Bolivia

4375 2018-03-11 21:20:10 You have no idea dude.  Like do you even understand how much safer pipeline transportation of oil is than trains and trucks?  It’s getting there anyways!
4376 2018-03-11 21:20:07 So Katz just said we’re “leaking oil” and suggested America picks whatever higher seed we face. 

Ok... let’s do this!
4377 2018-03-11 21:20:02 It’s gotta be pretty bad. Everything else has slid off like oil, so I don’t know what they can be afraid of.
4378 2018-03-11 21:20:01 Azam orders oil from Hakan for own purposes from Rashid's acc
4379 2018-03-11 21:19:54 taeyong isn't scared of the oil when you deep fry stuff so he is definitely not a human
4380 2018-03-11 21:19:53 Look at Mr. Fussy Eater over here, not happy with cod liver oil marshmallows.
4381 2018-03-11 21:19:51 I wouldn’t say dismantling for oil. Every country we invaded in the past 10 years virtually had no oil economy. Either because of sanctions or simply wasn’t a major player of oil. War made it more harder actually for oil prices. So it’s counter productive to go to war for oil.
4382 2018-03-11 21:19:50 tea tree oil  I get this a lot because I have a habit of resting my hand on my face 
4383 2018-03-11 21:19:30 Went to get a simple oil change ended up spending $130 on a radiator flush and all kind of shit
4384 2018-03-11 21:18:51 Larsson is only a top pair dman on the Oil.  That's not perspective that's a fact
4385 2018-03-11 21:18:49 Lets gather together a few (very often hazily factual) negative points into a little pile and say 'change can never happen, we just have to keep burning oil.)
LOL, or possibly yawn.
4386 2018-03-11 21:18:44 If the governments would ban these items, they can easily be made from corn starch products that dissolve in water. Styrofoam peanuts are already being substituted for cornstarch peanuts but oil is still too cheap for it to be competive. The gov is dragging it's heels.

4393 2018-03-11 21:17:24 Glad we’ve established those. If politians just said we are in the Middle East dismantling countries for oil then the American people wouldn’t go to war so easy. As long as they are honest as to why we are there and not saying “spreading freedom and democracy”
4394 2018-03-11 21:17:22 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC & signed permits for big oil to drill in the Arctic!
4395 2018-03-11 21:17:21 Oya my wife cover your eyes n live this place bfr they spoil u fr me
4396 2018-03-11 21:17:17 Trudeau defended the oil sands in this exchange and Nye accepted his points. Your campaign is so driven by emotion that you can rely on the willful ignorance of your base.
4397 2018-03-11 21:17:07 Yes but loser protesters are somehow Ok with oil and gas being shipped by truck and rail, going right by lakes and rivers. Where drinking water actually comes from. This proves they are being paid and mislead so Canadian oil doesn’t get to market. 
4398 2018-03-11 21:17:06 So Brit Gov.
Tell us when from these powers you're Keeping from Scotland.
When will you decide it's ok to Frack for Oil in Scotland.
4399 2018-03-11 21:16:42 The environmental movement means expansion of our economy by introducing new businessess & opportunities, products, more choices, while reducing negative economy (cleaning up oil spills,etc)
4400 2018-03-11 21:16:35 Those who would give up essential Postminimalism, to purchase a little temporary Instant hot water dispenser, deserve neither Sesame oil nor Athena.
4401 2018-03-11 21:16:33 Oh the hew and cry that will begin now.  100's of thou lost in oil patch, MSM briefly discusses.  But one bureaucratic postion lost through attrition will be a job cut! FAKE NEWS.
4402 2018-03-11 21:16:23 Isn’t that the same thing to Liberals?
4403 2018-03-11 21:15:42 8 points off Chelsea i smell oil
4404 2018-03-11 21:15:21 Mushrooms need to be done right.  olive oil wine and brown sugar carmalizes the shit out of them, it is amazing. I also really love them stuffed or as a burger topping
4405 2018-03-11 21:14:58 Lovely weekend at @lowsizerghbarn. Fuelled with a raw milk turmeric, coconut oil and maple syrup latte YUM! I grafted my very own Ribston Pippin apple and Green Chisel Pear under the fantastic guidance of Andy and Ian from South Lakes Orchard Group.

4409 2018-03-11 21:14:05 Exchanging wisdom is always something I'm up for, had a good random talk with this 60 year old man while we're getting our oil changed.
4410 2018-03-11 21:14:03 But for real like even with Psilocybin back in college I need extracted oil in a fuckload of sugary tea. I couldn’t hide them in chocolate, nacho cheese, pizza, anything. 
4411 2018-03-11 21:13:48 Thoughts on Coconut Oil, Costa?
4412 2018-03-11 21:13:46 My neighbor suggested essential oil diffuser with tea tree oil. I just need to find money somehow to get a diffuser. I have the oil.

4414 2018-03-11 21:13:34 How does lamp oil taste?

4418 2018-03-11 21:13:15 So I want to bless my new place and I’ve heard of the sage/olive oil but are there any other ways?

4422 2018-03-11 21:12:58 Some cleansers for oily/spot prone skin and how to get rid of the excess oil! Remeber this may not work on everyone
4423 2018-03-11 21:12:35 It’s called collusion and the fed govt doesn’t give a shyt 

When oil was at 100$ per barrel we had the same prices now that it’s 58$ per barrel 

Wtf
4424 2018-03-11 21:12:30 Sir jee @FawadNaeemRana pls award Lendl Simmons a lifetime supply of Qalco engine oil for his yaadgaar Super Over performance. 
4425 2018-03-11 21:12:29 Our kids are a better investment than Saudi oil. Why don’t the politicians get that? Invest in our future. Protect and support our kids!!!!

4427 2018-03-11 21:12:00 Just missing the snake oil sign
4428 2018-03-11 21:12:00 Back in the day, in Greece, at a taverna, I could order k'thopodi, short for okthopodi, 8 legs. But on the plate you only see one leg at a time, and chopped up, at that. Charred. Squeezed lemon. Salt. Olive Oil. Emily, congrats on the book!
4429 2018-03-11 21:11:46 Love experimenting with more organic products. Organic coconut oil in you hair. Makes your hair very soft. Lol
4430 2018-03-11 21:11:44 Made oil for the first time in 2011. Took my first dab after that initial run. Haven’t looked back since lol
4431 2018-03-11 21:11:41 Kano - Katsina road expansion &Kano Western Bypass was awarded during oil boom in 2013. Moved to d site in 2014 but FG did not pay so he stopped work. Oil price was still in Quilox range price in 2014 but Fashola paid. Work is going on at low oil price &terminates at Niger border

4433 2018-03-11 21:10:44 Alguém já usou bio oil e a parada foi realmente eficaz? (não acredito em blogueirinhas)
4434 2018-03-11 21:10:16 And it's still being done today. When the country as a whole needs the land for the benefit of the whole country, it's the country that comes first. Oil pipelines are a good example. Just the way of the world. In any case, concessions are always made to appease for the ill will.
4435 2018-03-11 21:10:09 Took these idiots 3 and a half hours to figure out that it was a bad oil filter
4436 2018-03-11 21:10:08 My mom got hypnotized over Skype this morning and is now at an essential oil party lmao why doesn’t she have her own tv show yet
4437 2018-03-11 21:10:08 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
4438 2018-03-11 21:09:47 I don’t really agree with arming Israel to the teeth and continuing bombing campaigns relentlessly. And reason for us being in the Middle East other than for control of oil is a fallacy 
4439 2018-03-11 21:09:39 It takes a lot of repair to total the cost of a new vehicle. We’ve been lucky with the Escape. Haven’t had to spend a ton of cash on repairs, but it’s had regular oil changes and maintenance as long as I’ve had it.

4442 2018-03-11 21:09:09 Mais c'est cette chère Olive Oil qui attend son Poppeye?
4443 2018-03-11 21:08:40 It sees you changed the issue here from guns to why the US is a super power. It has nothing to do with being allowed to carry a gun around. Did carrying a gun around find oil or contribute to agriculture Did it produce steel to sell to the world. No it didn't stop talking shit.
4444 2018-03-11 21:08:31 Yup. I’d like to see him on the 3rd paring for next year though with 2nd unit PP. a healthy Sekera, Nurse, Russel, D addition, Larsson and Bear would be a very good and well balanced D that also doesn’t break the bank & allows the oil to retain its centre depth.
4445 2018-03-11 21:08:12 @kelticdrumer Glad your Oil won. Can we change the channel now? 
… You said you didn't give a fuck about hockey 
And I never saw someone say that before

Just as we don’t use coal oil to light lamps anymore, coal will not be the way electricity is generating
4450 2018-03-11 21:07:11 Wow! I think crude oil is "brut" in French; "brut" means "raw" but "brute" is, well, a brute. So not sweet. Ahhhhhh *runs around in circles while clutching a dictionary* :D
4451 2018-03-11 21:07:08 you know when lorde went on a rant about how bad her skin is and how she’s tired of people telling her to wash her face, use coconut oil etc? I felt that

4454 2018-03-11 21:06:34 American Gov. Should stay in their Capitalist lane and stop wanting to control the decisions made by other Communist nations like the(N.Korea). Water & oil can never be a complilation but a recipe of destruction.
4455 2018-03-11 21:06:24 I cut them in half, and mix them in a bowl w/olive oil, bit of tumeric, seasoning pepper, and a tiny bit of salt. I do them in the oven on 350 for a little over 10 minutes or until they're sizzling with the oil / start browning
4456 2018-03-11 21:06:10 @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR @TRobinsonNewEra We should be ashamed of ourselves as Cristian country. We let Islamic hate preachers run around our streets , mosques and Universities. #FreeSpeech #Democracy God Bless

4462 2018-03-11 21:05:22 Also @LouCadle’s oil apocalypse series is really enjoyable.
4463 2018-03-11 21:05:16 And its so stupid, we have the most efficient way to move grain and we are using it to ship oil in the least efficient way

4468 2018-03-11 21:04:48 I'd love to see LA boycott oil. Imagine that if you can. Cars, electricity, plastics. LA goes Amish.

4472 2018-03-11 21:03:40 I just followed the two sessions meeting's and some policies are very interesting like the global development project, could you help  Timor develop their new oil and gas field form the new Maritime borderline and invest on Indonesia and military cooperation?

4477 2018-03-11 21:02:42 By certain climates scientists I mean those who fudge data to account for their wildly inaccurate computer models. And alarmists like Al Gore who claim Florida will be underwater in 50 years if we don't purchase carbon offsets.

Wouldn't trust the oil companies, either.

4486 2018-03-11 21:00:41 I'm guessing very few
4487 2018-03-11 21:00:38 also you accidentally deleted a single piece of track at around the 20 minute mark thus ensuring that the oil train will never get through, i'm gonna guess that there'll be an argument about that in a few episodes
4488 2018-03-11 21:00:23 fun fact if you put castor oil on your eyebrows and then exhale while drinking a cup of something hot the steam blows over your eyebrows and it tingles weirdly in like waves. it feels odd af bc the tingle remains for a second after the steam is gone

4507 2018-03-11 20:57:11 Rural economies depend on demand for #soybean oil for biodiesel and corn for ethanol. RIN caps will destroy biofuels demand. @realDonaldTrump, please support rural America & oppose RIN caps. #RFSworks

4511 2018-03-11 20:56:53 Last month, the California State Lands Commission put a massive roadblock in Trump’s plan to open the Pacific coast to new oil and gas drilling. The commission, which controls the state’s entire coastline, said it will not not issue the pipeline permits drillers would need.
4512 2018-03-11 20:56:48 This oil diffuser was the best $50 I've ever spent
4513 2018-03-11 20:56:35 //Why do I imagine the ‘yo drink this vodka down the hatch’ vine but it’s Ouma with the cooking oil
4514 2018-03-11 20:56:20 America's wealth is based entirely on the petrodollar, when oil runs out in the next 100 years your currency is gonna become worthless and America will go through hyperinflation
4515 2018-03-11 20:56:03 HE PROBABLY IS UNAWARE THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IS SUING THE USA FOR BREECH OF CONTRACT.  WE CAN VERY SUDDENLY STOP ALL OIL IMPORTS. WATER FRESH WATER THAT IS. WOOD. FORESTRY. WHEAT.  AND WE CAN REMOVE SOME 200 AMERICAN COMPANIES FROM OUR COUNTRY IN A HEART BEAT.

4517 2018-03-11 20:55:40 If it makes you feel better I actually typed “oil derrick” and almost tweeted that and was like “Wait wait, I’ve been corrected about this before…what is it again?"

4522 2018-03-11 20:54:57 I put aloe vera plant on my face once a day, tone with apple cider vinegar, wash daily with just a gentle face wash and exfoliate with apricot scrub 2-3 times a week. I also moisturize with an oil free moisturizer.
4523 2018-03-11 20:54:29 @cliftonartsclub  I have an oil painting by Kathy Luders. She does beautiful work. Sure would be nice to meet her some day. My husband and I live in Iowa, USA. We are Jim and Cathy Luders.
4524 2018-03-11 20:54:24 Gdp rates have nothing to do with real income, wtf are you talking about. All these gdp benefits go to politicians. Before 2008 with these oil prices we could have Skyscrapers all over European part of Russia, but still got only 3-4 decent cities

4528 2018-03-11 20:53:42 Yes. And until we fix this, they'll continue to. Too many guns, no decent healthcare, too broke to buy food, or oil for the furnace or even for a roof over their heads. Yes.
4529 2018-03-11 20:53:42 Coconut oil or shea butter ?
4530 2018-03-11 20:53:32 dont trust the snake oil salesman.. this land assembly selling is diminishing the single family houses causing them to triple in value, closing out any chances for regular B.C. Vancouverites to buy, but hey this government says live in the basements of the immigrants houses
4531 2018-03-11 20:52:53 And acting ? Asia Cooking Oil
4532 2018-03-11 20:52:49 I add cayenne and chilli oil to just about everything. #spicy

4536 2018-03-11 20:51:50 This almond oil been good to me 
4537 2018-03-11 20:51:47 It’s not a proper challah, bc it’s got both eggs and butter in it... and I threw in some other flavors- olive oil, thyme, Parmesan
4538 2018-03-11 20:51:47 The worlds largest hotel company Airbnb, doesn't own a single piece of real estate.

4539 2018-03-11 20:51:32 Put half a bottle of argan oil on my hair and now it feels like I’ve put a chip pan on me head 
4540 2018-03-11 20:51:31 Use red oil
4541 2018-03-11 20:51:15 Coconut milk and coconut oil is great.
4542 2018-03-11 20:51:12 I use Trader Joe’s vitamin e oil. No marks yet and it’s week 22.
4543 2018-03-11 20:51:10 Coconut oil and Shea butter are no real moisturizes tbh! Water based leave in is your go to source of moisture, continuous use of those two you use would just seal your scalp and no real moisture would get there
4544 2018-03-11 20:50:16 The goddesses of natural hair have seen fit to bless my curls today. In the name of shea butter, coconut and castor oil, amen 
4545 2018-03-11 20:50:07 They can oil her up in jail lol
4546 2018-03-11 20:49:58 $60 WTI is normal that’s $28 Canadian Select. $26 WTI was Canadian Oil giving our resources away as they got rid of labour. Most profits were made over seas as railways were utilized but the pipeline threat was PR crap
4547 2018-03-11 20:49:50 I wish my dad showed me how to do masculine things, like riding a dirt bike, or learn how to do an oil change
4548 2018-03-11 20:49:43 America playing the devil role for Global peace , you will see America every where in the world destabilizing the world peace especially in Muslims world to occupy their natural resources like oil and promoting their arms sales . America is going to destroy the world peace .

4551 2018-03-11 20:48:53 Gone but not forgotten! Amazing aircraft. “Yarmouth Coastguard this is R125 inbound with oil coming down the windscreen”. “Is that an issue?”  “Only if it stops!!”
4552 2018-03-11 20:48:48 A 10 acre compound/mosque will house a lot of Muslims. Are they coming to work in Alberta oil patch? If not then why Ft McMurray?
4553 2018-03-11 20:48:32 @Gladwell THANK YOU! Since listening to Revisionist History, we switched all our fryers to Beef Tallow. We were already using beef fat, but blanching in vegetable oil. The difference has been a game changer! Literally. We now cook our chicken and fries 100% in Beef Fat! THANK YOU
4554 2018-03-11 20:47:50 Oh my god, I'm exhausted. I did trampling, spanking, sounding, got my dildo sucked, then finished it with getting a hot oil massage. ONE NIGHT, ONE FEMDOM PARTY.  Ya'll kinky people need to come to UTAH.
4555 2018-03-11 20:47:28 also today i went to buy more parev chicken soup powder and the kosher section had been turned over for pesach with the shelves lined with brown paper (cute but extremely confusing! it was literally in a sainsbury's) and all they had were 2 varieties of matzah, grape juice, & oil
4556 2018-03-11 20:47:24 I need to pop by for some more olive oil next time you're there!
4557 2018-03-11 20:47:20 Conflict of interest, or lack thereof. Is the solar panel lobby really trying to bring down big oil? What’s the sinister self-serving motive from the climate  change camp? It exists in all other examples
4558 2018-03-11 20:47:18 How do you revive say Olivine Industries if you don't create jobs through projects that will give pple disposal income to spend on luxuries like margarine, cooking oil bath soap (some of Olivine industies products)
4559 2018-03-11 20:47:18 Haha Ive got lessons planned to be specifically on those ideas so oil, conflict etc but wanted a bit of an overall... But I will get my head around it this evening - will be grateful for anything you have though - running out of ideas 
4560 2018-03-11 20:46:56 Where's Jack or Olive Oil?
4561 2018-03-11 20:46:10 Growth in our 'foreign reserves' is driven by;
1. Foreign Portfolio Investment of $7.3b...volatile and very refundable
2. Declining Foreign Direct Investment of $982m
3. Crude Oil Price doubling since 2015.Hence, any decline in either Oil Price or Production will expose d reality
4562 2018-03-11 20:46:10 And you do know Trudeau is in favor of oil sands and pipelines, right? You're seeing conspiracy everywhere, pal! Abacus Data is a serious research and polling firm. Come on! You're seeing bias everywhere, even though in this case the bias should be in Trudeau's favor. It isn't.
4563 2018-03-11 20:46:09 Damn Scandanavians...
4564 2018-03-11 20:45:48 How is Bernie a commie? Does he want the US to total take control over the oil and corn industries? Does he want the government to own the internet instead of private companies?

Do you even know what a mixed market economy is? Sorry to be condescending, but I doubt y'all do
4565 2018-03-11 20:45:47 My job be testing my gangsta like I won’t burn they ass with that hot ass oil
4566 2018-03-11 20:45:37 Your profile pic is someone (you?) at the controls of an aircraft. Any idea how much gas/oil those things burn?

4570 2018-03-11 20:44:03 Thanks @jiffylube for over torquing my oil drain plug and stripping it bare. Can’t get it to open anymore. See you soon #yyc #rant #Calgary
4571 2018-03-11 20:43:57 And the pipelines make billions of dollars per year.  7 years more of oil wont be the end of the world.  Lets tap it while we can and invest in infastructure and solar farms and wind farms.  Science the shit out of it for 7 years.
4572 2018-03-11 20:43:48 Olive Oil ain't gon' be able to name the mayor like Nancy Grace will.
4573 2018-03-11 20:43:42 The real kicker of the example I’m thinking of, is that they were relying on no one clicking through to read the paper linked.
People accepted the logical equivalent of “The engine will seize if you start it” when it’s “the engine will seize if you start it without oil.”
4574 2018-03-11 20:43:23 اللهم امين
4575 2018-03-11 20:43:13 Check the strategy in energy polls towards rhe end of the report. Most canadians think we should invest in clean energy as they believe demand for oil will decrease.

4578 2018-03-11 20:42:54 Oh yes, we have more options that you can imagine! Are you a vegan and cbd consumer? Well we have peanut butter, different jellies, honey, caramel, coconut oil, candies and gummies of every variety! If we don't have it, we'll find it!
4579 2018-03-11 20:42:43 You idiot. India was imperialised by the British so it served British interest & not Indian interest. The US has a lot of commodities such as oil which make it rich. However India now has the largest growth followed by China.
4580 2018-03-11 20:42:40 Thats season two just finished, looking back on it, Trish should have tried to find some Nature Max Supplements Fish Oil haha  #jessicajones #marvel #marvelcinematicuniverse #AgentsofSHIELD
4581 2018-03-11 20:42:36 In solubility chemistry, a pure liquid is "saturated," in a sense. But it really defines the amount of a substance (solute) dissolved in a solvent.

It's related to molecular similarity. Like dissolves like. Water & salt are more similar than water & oil even tho oil is liquid.
4582 2018-03-11 20:42:27 I work in IT and know what you need to do. Switch it off and then back on again. If that fails, immerse in boiling hot engine oil.
4583 2018-03-11 20:42:16 I'm pretty sure BMW's cost like $200 for an oil change
4584 2018-03-11 20:42:12 Funny how you left out the "sells weapons for dirt cheap" part on Obama's image, as if he just gets cheap oil for nothing.
4585 2018-03-11 20:42:06 30 drops carrier oil (sweet almond) + 10 drops sandalwood essential oil + 4 drops bergamot essential oil = a perfect blend.

I'm calling it Warm Grey.
4586 2018-03-11 20:42:03 Lets just cut off the oil supply to bc and see how they make out.. I give it about three daya
4587 2018-03-11 20:42:03  oil is fun

4592 2018-03-11 20:41:29 @GovHowardDean @AlexWitt    N Korea buys Russian oil, they're Allies. NO WAY ConMan Trump was EVER gonna stand up to N Korea, he's a FRAUD
4593 2018-03-11 20:41:20 Barron’s article on Venny today behind on their news . No way Maduro can last several years. Debt arrears getting far behond on both sovereign and pdvsa . New trump oil sanctions coming soon. Creditors still on holding pattern .
4594 2018-03-11 20:41:17 Tweeted from your phone most likely, using lithium batteries mined from a pit mine in a third world country, encased in plastic made from oil mined in the Canadian oil sands, in your home built with synthetic insulation, shingled with asphalt shingles, and warmed with gas.
4595 2018-03-11 20:41:12 thought peppermint would be a nice scent to put in the oil burner but now my room smells like a fucking polo
4596 2018-03-11 20:41:00 why is every oily skin routine about stopping oil or getting matte skin girl i need that shine otherwise my face gets ashy :/

4603 2018-03-11 20:40:00 Great desert idea! Cut a pear, peach or fruit of your choice in half, drizzle with a little olive oil and place it on the grill for a couple minutes. Remove and sprinkle with cinnamon.
4604 2018-03-11 20:39:46 Love that scene iv,y get covered with oil, one of the hottest on earth
4605 2018-03-11 20:39:40 And many many hybrids do contain oil, just small amounts so they don't list it up high.
4606 2018-03-11 20:39:38 castor oil on your scalp
4607 2018-03-11 20:39:37 Agreed. Just look at his policy positions. Look at his history literally decades of saying the same thing. And look at how he takes no money from Big Banks big Pharma Big Oil. If you say you were Progressive but you're against Bernie you need some self-examination.
4608 2018-03-11 20:39:19 Legalize Hemp then stop cutting trees biodegradable plastic bottles w/ Hemp Oil instead of crude oil. War on drugs is cause of climate change

4610 2018-03-11 20:39:06 I agree with these (we used to buy oil but now my hubby doesn’t have time for oil changes). Check out Victor Allen coffee for your Kuerig! It will save you more money, tastes great & is manufactured here in Wisconsin!

4614 2018-03-11 20:36:31 Jiffey lube changed my oil faster than Jack in the box could make some curly fries. Get your shit together Jack
4615 2018-03-11 20:36:25 Democrats are organizing those walkouts.  Part of their propaganda operation.  They don’t care if it hurts those kids.  They pretty much ruined public education anyway.
4616 2018-03-11 20:36:21 I got such a horrible burn once because I used Baby oil. I laid in the tanning bed having forgotten I put it on. Yikes!
4617 2018-03-11 20:36:21 I asked because when you moisturize your skin with oily skin it makes your skin more oily, I will suggest you change it to a cream that only hidrates and not cause more oil (an special cream). I used to moisturize my skin with any cream and it caused me a lot of oil so my skin
4618 2018-03-11 20:35:57 अबे बाकी के लोग झूठ नी फैलारे
4619 2018-03-11 20:35:54 That unnecessary socially awkward tension as a straight man walking into a beauty supply store. 

I need black soap and Jamaican castor oil like the rest of you.
4620 2018-03-11 20:35:45 My mom has one and every time I come home we use it at least once. It’s so easy and doesn’t have to preheat or anything. The one thing I will say, is because there is no oil our samosas were not golden brown. Other than that it’s awesome and healthier than a deep fryer or an oven
4621 2018-03-11 20:35:26 The state of Israel IS a U.S. imperialist foreign policy strategy. Israel is key to all of U.S. elite interests in middle east. Iraq was conquered for same reasons, much more important than just oil there are many other strategic/economic reasons for the military invasion of Iraq
4622 2018-03-11 20:35:17 Nope. The oil in the Middle East is drying up. They need our oil.
4623 2018-03-11 20:34:54 I work in the oil industry. Even though it's my only way can earn enough to feed my family it needs to change. I see untouched forest turned to a muddy swampy mess everyday. Take guys like me and retrain us in clean energy....I'm not the only one who wants out. #retraintheworkers
4624 2018-03-11 20:34:36 2. Russia been on long game

Including Rosneft oil Deal
4625 2018-03-11 20:34:10 Hummmmmm how about 60/20/20 And I'll bring the oil.
4626 2018-03-11 20:34:10 But they occupy oil fields on East bank of Eufrat for their allies from #US #DeepState. Maybe it is enough for Kurds 
4627 2018-03-11 20:34:02 Coconut oil is the answer to everything basically 
4628 2018-03-11 20:33:49 If so that explains why his policies and lack of pipelines is driving out current oil sands developers. 
When the shares are nickels on the dollar he'll sell them off to his Muslim friends and/or Saud family.
Then pipelines will get built
4629 2018-03-11 20:33:45 i got so many jars of raw coconut oil.
4630 2018-03-11 20:33:44 They'll lose funding!!!!!  BRACE!!!!
4631 2018-03-11 20:33:40 My friend please try some baby oil. @JNJCares  not the supermarket own brand for a smooth action throughout. Let me know how you get on.
4632 2018-03-11 20:33:18 Yea. Soldiers may give protection to the Oil cars but it's impossible to protect all and on the entire parts of the streets. If they were traveling through Oromia, it will be difficult to protect them. ከየት መጣ ሳይባል ነው አንድ ጩጬ ወጥቶ የሚለኩሰው :)

4639 2018-03-11 20:31:44 @cchukudebelu @APCNigeria @OfficialPDPNig @benmurraybruce @MBuhari @bukolasaraki @ProfOsinbajo @atiku Absolutely. Outside of sharing of oil money amongst loud mouth and no good politicians, I don’t know what in the world we have Government in Nigeria for.
4640 2018-03-11 20:31:44 No amount of OIL is worth this much life Please no more @realDonaldTrump remeber the man up stairs is watching Please no more money for WARS ENOUGH is ENOUGH
4641 2018-03-11 20:31:24 Don't use any materials that require oil then. You're only increasing global demand for in doing so. Start growing materials for your clothes, your food, get off the internet and don't use ant tech devices, go buy a horse and build your own cart by cutting your own trees, etc.
4642 2018-03-11 20:31:22 Gah! Are Prime and Oil Slick still available?
4643 2018-03-11 20:31:06 Just imagine if nigeria never had oil, with our level of corruption, we will be anything below a third world country.
4644 2018-03-11 20:31:02 I really want to try oil painting, my friend did a Bob Ross tutorial the other day with actual supplies and am did a great job and I'm SO INSPIRED

4652 2018-03-11 20:30:02 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
4653 2018-03-11 20:29:59 Are you aware that a good faith argument involves back and forth dialog. It isn't a dissertation designed to anticipate all possible objections to a particular point of view. Given this would you care to elaborate about oil or NATO as it relates to Norway's version of socialism?
4654 2018-03-11 20:29:54 Isn't ABM connected to BMD.. and of course C Oil..?
4655 2018-03-11 20:29:20 Pros to LUSH baths:
- You smell v tasty. 
- The water is pretty. 

Cons: 
- You can’t get out of the bath for the amount of oil in bath melts. 
- The glitter takes about five years to remove. 

So you end up stuck in the bath looking like the morning aftermath of Parklife.
4656 2018-03-11 20:29:06 Is it the saturated fat, the protein? Or...

4657 2018-03-11 20:28:58 Leave it to Indiana to take a passable CBD oil bill and turn it into gun legislation!
4658 2018-03-11 20:28:22 "we hate oil because it ruins our lands and ocean. But please ignore all the materials we use on a daily basis that depend on oil". Lol
4659 2018-03-11 20:28:21 I used to do eyelashes and my advice was never rub your eyes and yes you can wash your face just don’t use any oily based products. Oil breaks up the glue compound and the fall off and start to turn white. No need to curl them or add mascara.
4660 2018-03-11 20:28:07 The petro will be backed by oil, gold, and mineral reserves and that is a good strategy but Maduro’s Government suffers from corruption and a lack of transparency. The problem the petro faces is that the international community does not trust Venezuela’s Government.
4661 2018-03-11 20:27:53 *slides into your house covered in body oil*

can't stand that Bubsy boy!
4662 2018-03-11 20:27:41 FML can't get oil drain plug out
4663 2018-03-11 20:27:35 It’ll feel super gross at first because your hair is used to producing that extra oil to compensate for the shampoo stripping it but after a couple weeks your hair should adjust. Also try using shampoos designed for oily hairs if you can’t stand it, & don’t touch your hair a lot
4664 2018-03-11 20:27:33 I need to be a false lashes girl because this oil your lashes to make them grow thing is long
4665 2018-03-11 20:27:30 Get in. Will be bringing the leftovers in tomorrow. In my defence I used chorizo that way to make an oil.
4666 2018-03-11 20:27:26 And now I'm starting to understand you're from Alberta. Listen, most canadians agree on something, oil sands are dirty and we must invest in clean energy. Sorry man, but canadians strongly oppose new pipelines...
4667 2018-03-11 20:27:21 All i know is add water and conditioner and oil
4668 2018-03-11 20:27:19 my car smells like straight oil

4674 2018-03-11 20:25:12 @thisoldplumber Is there an on demand hot water heater that can work on oil as the fuel?
4675 2018-03-11 20:24:46 Lol Dave Suzuki - the man that's been considered and proven to be the biggest fraud? Should he be covered in homemade hemp clothing - or the like - that he's grown in his backyard, instead of from a manufacturer that uses oil to create products?
4676 2018-03-11 20:24:46 ما يسمى (oil in place وفقا لرسالتي للدكتوراه عام 1988 قبل 30 سنة هو 530 مليار برميل وان نسبة الاستخراج تتراوح ما بين 30 % و50%  أما الآن فغالبا ان oil in place حوالي 700 مليار برميل وقد ترتفع نسبة الاستخراج حسب ارتفاع السعر الى 65 %
4677 2018-03-11 20:24:35  no I was bored & waiting to get my oil changed

4679 2018-03-11 20:24:31 Oily Moily. A had a big oil scam in his name. Tell him to make his face correct. Seems like a sick person who has run from ICU.
4680 2018-03-11 20:24:29 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.

4681 2018-03-11 20:24:25 Drunk elephant marula oil, farsali oil unicorn tears and tatcha silk cream  I use all three before I put my makeup on and its fucking amazingggggg! My skin is dry as fuck though so I’d change up the tatcha cream depending on your skin type 
4682 2018-03-11 20:23:57 Wow I am done waiting for the last minute to get my oil changed 
4683 2018-03-11 20:23:55 For a while I struggled trying to decide between oil and butter #naturahairproblems
4684 2018-03-11 20:23:50 Air pollution from oil has a deadly impact on people. And those with less money often face the brunt of air pollution as those with money can afford to live in areas with less pollution. Plus those with less will likely be impacted the most by climate change. Sigh.
4685 2018-03-11 20:23:44 Drank castor oil, eggplant Parmesan in the oven. Come on baby E 
4686 2018-03-11 20:23:44 Standard Oil and IG Farben had an exclusive patent licensing agreement whereby IG Farben could use Standard's patented technology to make synthetic fuel from coal.
4687 2018-03-11 20:23:37 Micellar water or oil cleansers are the best 
4688 2018-03-11 20:23:03 No no I be moses I d show ppl like u the way to promise land ...
4689 2018-03-11 20:22:32 A nice if very brief and very cold #motorcycle ride around the neighborhood. Mostly I wanted to get gas, put air in the tires and slosh the oil around. End of this season it's definitely going to be due for a big tuneup / oil change. It's starting to ride wonkier than usual.

4694 2018-03-11 20:21:39 But it is,everything about Trump screams snake oil salesman,carnival barker,two-bit sleight of hand huckster and con man. He was that when he was in real estate, even prouder of it when he was on TV,now he is the grand marshal of the biggest medicine show, 3-ring circus of all!

4700 2018-03-11 20:20:35 Actually, we went after Iraq's oil, despite actual evidence & facts re: who carried out 9/11.
4701 2018-03-11 20:20:28 Actually, people who sell you snake oil have at least taken the time to create a product.
4702 2018-03-11 20:20:24 All of the materials used to build this building relied on oil in one form or another. How ironic.
4703 2018-03-11 20:20:06 Electric cars are usually powered by coal, oil or nuclear power. Unless your electricity comes from wind or solar power.
4704 2018-03-11 20:20:06 I thought all Black people knew not to put oil down the drain you take that shit outside 
4705 2018-03-11 20:19:54 Olive oil in the ol coffee.

4710 2018-03-11 20:19:01 Yes, I am getting “exactly what I deserved” - an extra $200/month on my paycheck and a city that is now booming after an 8 year slump. (I’m in Houston, our economy is dramatically affected by oil and gas). I am on cloud 9!
4711 2018-03-11 20:18:56 Service has some oil to it this morning. 
4712 2018-03-11 20:18:39 But I promise if you put lotion on 3 times a day or more it gets so much better in less than 24 hours! Or coconut oil!!!!!!

4717 2018-03-11 20:17:28 The gatekeeper of pain? What nonsense. I claim nothing more than offering one perspective. Re:comments; I've received several hateful emails, and several thanking me for raising the issue of what excessive fear oil an unlikely risk is doing to our school kids.

4720 2018-03-11 20:16:40 Olive Oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and sesame oil are so essential for cooking! Gives food such good flavors!
4721 2018-03-11 20:16:22 That little creep who has never had a real job but calls himself a labour MP @johnmcdonnellMP says if we vote for him he will give us £70billion If scots vote for INDEPENDENCE we can keep £hundreds of billions of  all our Scottish oil money and he can fuk off
4722 2018-03-11 20:16:14 No she was Italian and also made meatballs. She like poached onions in a shit load of oil and added canned tomatoes to it
4723 2018-03-11 20:16:10 Not only do those buses use oil but let's also look at what else requires oil for manufacturing and/or transportation: clothes, signs, the wood for signs, backpacks, coffee mugs, the bridge, the building, the glass, the scissors/razors to cut hair off all those heads, etc.
4724 2018-03-11 20:16:08 You guys love that one example of failed socialism, even though it's a corrupt authoritarian dictatorship and that bet everything on oil and lost, with our government's help through sanctions.
4725 2018-03-11 20:16:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet revisit them.
4726 2018-03-11 20:16:06 Mad Maxine is one of the dumbest people ever to hold a congressional seat. Remember when she threatened to nationalize oil companies. She also happens to be one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington.

4734 2018-03-11 20:13:56 Oh yeah, they can pack a punch in their dishes! This is a Korean ramen, and boy do they love their chili peppers. This has a smoked chili oil flavor, it's so good.
4735 2018-03-11 20:13:48 The grandma anecdote just slayed me. I have experimented with coconut oil and really liked it, and now I definitely will go back to it. I like cutting it with a light face cream (like Cetaphil’s) to intensify the hydration without getting that oily feeling!
4736 2018-03-11 20:13:16 Agree! Dati sunflower oil na pangprito lang alam ko eh! Hahaha
4737 2018-03-11 20:13:07 Sounds amazing, drinks more oil than a Chevy? Say it with me, rotary!
4738 2018-03-11 20:12:48 That’s what I would suggest, or we once took coconut oil into the shower and slathered her head in it and combed it out that way. It was time consuming and I was soaked by the end :/

4744 2018-03-11 20:11:55 My own view economy wise is they are not reliant on mass imports (?) apart from maybe oil/gas. In fact, they are s Big exported (nuclear, auto, wine, aviation etc).They are more self-sufficient as an economy, they even holiday at home!! That book showed there is a social contract
4745 2018-03-11 20:11:54 They should be charging people of middle eastern appearance more, as they are all oil tycoons.

4748 2018-03-11 20:11:15 You know how there is beard oil? Do they have that for eyebrows? Because they need to stay juicy.
4749 2018-03-11 20:11:14 lmaoooo my girl said the oil must be fresh for the color to look like that but it looks like no seasoning at all. 
4750 2018-03-11 20:11:02 And you are happy? Do you know how much bill gate is worth? An individual without oil.
4751 2018-03-11 20:10:50 It messes up vagina pH because it's made for anal. Also any hybrid lube will be unsafe with condoms the same way coconut oil is, not just this one, just a safety tip.
4752 2018-03-11 20:10:40 Haha, we swabbed used motor oil on the spots. Seemed to work-ish??

4765 2018-03-11 20:09:21 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed and given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC & signed permits 4 big oil to drill in the Arctic!
4766 2018-03-11 20:08:57 Look forward to seeing you free the world from this peak oil Nazi moment. Add Permaculture and integrate with me bio char, aquaponics, for circular economy demonstration. Showcase regenerative leisure.

4768 2018-03-11 20:08:32 What’s an example of a carrier oil
4769 2018-03-11 20:08:24 The bad news is when he took it apart the gun left some oil on the couch and his wife kicked his ass.

4773 2018-03-11 20:07:40 What did Russia do to deserve sanctions? Really, their country is just an oil field in the whole scheme of the world.

4777 2018-03-11 20:07:28 It's not just the majority position, it's what the Smith Commission promised, that Scotland should lead when it has the “predominant policy interest”, yet is being completely run roughshod over by the UK gov.
Predominant policy interests, like fisheries, farming, whisky, Oil etc.
4778 2018-03-11 20:07:28 okay I don't care what anyone thinks of my @AldiUK obsession I tried the Lacura foundation and concealer pen today and they're bloody fab!!! I also use the Lacura day and night cream, the hot cleanser and i really want to find the treatment oil

4784 2018-03-11 20:06:53 My current thermostat is WiFi linked so does those "input" and "output" bits already. It had occurred that if it can respond to weather, it could in theory respond to grid prices without a smart meter being needed. But I'm on oil so it's irrelevant until I get that sorted!
4785 2018-03-11 20:06:45 Grape seed oil next time
4786 2018-03-11 20:06:26 I got my oil changed. Finally. This weekend is automatically a successful weekend #SmallWin :)
4787 2018-03-11 20:05:13 I've a chemical burn on my face from hair removal cream. 
I should just get beard oil and embrace who I am..
4788 2018-03-11 20:04:58 Tape works. The worst part is I bought a $3 extention cord for the headphones that didn't even work at walmart. Well at least I didn't buy $7 burnt sesame oil that's not being used...
4789 2018-03-11 20:04:57 Looking for oil to finish a move down towards 58. Russell to take a nice punch by end of the week. $usoil $WTIC $dwt $srty $RUT $RTY
4790 2018-03-11 20:04:38 If it's beautiful, they want to leak on it. It wasn't an accident that they hired a drunk captain for that tanker. The oil industry is just plain evil.
4791 2018-03-11 20:04:31 An essential oil diffuser is so necessary
4792 2018-03-11 20:04:21 making brownies with raspberry filling with bananas instead of using oil. #Healthy @EightBitDylan @Delphron @desmond_amazing
4793 2018-03-11 20:04:21 Not what's going on here.  You're comparing Twinkies, apples, motor oil, cleaning services, and horse shoes (in another country). Trade deficits arise from aggregates of trade, not Twinkies, and not retail. Subsidized grossly net-exports based on slave labor is not "free trade."
4794 2018-03-11 20:04:08 I forgot how much I loved coconut oil because I haven't had any for a few months
4795 2018-03-11 20:04:03 How ridiculous and stupid it is! Vegan menswear? Are you kidding? Colors and dyers for fabrics requires a huge chemical industry. Cotton requires fertilizers otherwise it would cost a lot of money to grow! Plastics require oil sub-products.
4796 2018-03-11 20:03:53 People always wanna just talk about gas .... like nooooooo, it’s about the miles, wear & tear of my tires, running my engine, running my oil out, when it comes down to getting that inspection, registration.. all that is why I ride alone at all times now.
4797 2018-03-11 20:03:42 It’s Trudeau’s master plan to not allow oil production to be shipped via pipeline thus setting up conditions where the economics of producing oil from the Athabaskan basin are cost prohibitive.Coupled with high taxes and environmental constraints the oil companies will shut down.
4798 2018-03-11 20:03:21 let state tv fox do that-the rest of the population does NOT want to hear anything the Insane OLD MAN on the STAGE selling SNAKE OIL has to Say-he is a snake start reporting how much of snake not putting him on prime tv - we can't even have our children watch.. how sad is that...
4799 2018-03-11 20:03:14 Looks almost like an oil hose fitting came loose
4800 2018-03-11 20:03:12 I keep hearing that since NOV 16. All I see is winning. ISIS dead. Tax cut passed. Jobs coming back. US will dominate oil which will ruin the Mideast Despots and put Putin on his heels. But keep saying disaster...and pray for Bernies health
4801 2018-03-11 20:02:54 D has tried some type of oil but not olive. Will suggest that.
4802 2018-03-11 20:02:49 Mexican Crude Oil Basket returns to the top with a profit of $1.21 USD this way the Mexican Crude Oil Basket recovers its level against the WTI and  Brent after suffering two reductions in the price due to the increased production in USA.
4803 2018-03-11 20:02:35 Whew that’s impressive.  You guys should live without any oil and gas, or their byproducts.  I’d totally follow a blog about that.
4804 2018-03-11 20:02:31 I did try some tea tree oil. We’ll see.
4805 2018-03-11 20:02:27 I highly recommend coconut oil baths. 

Just be careful, it gets slippery!
4806 2018-03-11 20:02:22 Zionists don't like faithful, religious Jews. But they have always pretended to be religious Jews to win the argument about their "right of return". The reality is, they abandoned God long ago. Today they are more interested in exploiting Syria's Golan Heights oil reserves.
4807 2018-03-11 20:02:21 Dems are too classy to have rallies.   We know they are the stuff of fascists and fakes - political snake oil salesmen
4808 2018-03-11 20:02:01 my gf has so many types of fish oil its like damn yea lemme get uhhhhhhhhh that eastern humpback oil im tryna grow some mf gills
4809 2018-03-11 20:01:59 Paraguay importa el 100% de sus combustibles, paga más flete y así el gas oil cuesta $ 23 y ganan plata, háblame de eficiencia!!! Sin vergüenzas
4810 2018-03-11 20:01:58 Do the senators mean Kim might play dt the way big oil pharma nra the Koch bros play them every day?
4811 2018-03-11 20:01:50 Give big hand of clap to @LegitLawson for win entry to Marlie battle tomorrow at Maple Leaf battle stations! Thanks to all komrades who play, more prize in future. Remember for drink motors oil and eat raw meats for stay mule! #TMLtalk
4812 2018-03-11 20:01:41 I had Chunky Monkey and they use almonds and coconut oil.
4813 2018-03-11 20:01:41 Corey put oil all over pit road, slippery.
4814 2018-03-11 20:01:36 Pray that the 10% Lifu voters don't prefer Lolu next time. In fact, you already know the answer to that one. Miracle and Leo are water and oil.

4817 2018-03-11 20:01:15 Shipping Oil by train is not only the least efficient way but also the most dangerous. Yet they protest against pipelines and a great industry.
4818 2018-03-11 20:01:07 We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
4819 2018-03-11 20:00:49 You can't bitch about oil rich clubs when being reliant on the results of American football clubs from Florida yourself. Self-caused dilemma. So Chelski & City were 'smarter' (not really) in picking their owners. That whole concept stinks top to bottom.
4820 2018-03-11 20:00:42 Put a few drops of vinegar on a piece of oil.
4821 2018-03-11 20:00:27 I only grade learning in the grade book, not behaviors. Formative work is chronicled, but for No Credit. We have lunch detentions, but this does not impact skipping. What works at other schools? Skipping French to get your oil changed at Walmart?
4822 2018-03-11 20:00:18 You're correct, energy conservation was the main motive in the past (around the time of US oil embargo in the 70's I think?), and energy conservation is still a benefit we experience today for keeping it implemented. But seriously the Halloween thing is real.
4823 2018-03-11 20:00:14 After you’ve cooked let the oil cool then carefully remove the foil by creating a little “container” out of it and dispose how you like. You won’t have a mess and no pan to clean.
4824 2018-03-11 20:00:05 The arrival of #DaylightSavingsTime means the beginning of #SpringCleaning in our house. Work from the top down: clean ceiling fans, dust walls and doors, and oil hinges to begin. Looks better already!
4825 2018-03-11 19:59:56 Bear is having a good start. Yamamoto looks like a great passer/playmaker. Benson could be an NHLer.  We’re still waiting on Puljujarvi to gain a bigger role. The top pick this summer could impact the team in 2 years or less if the pick is higher than expected. 2 yr wait for oil.
4826 2018-03-11 19:59:32 'It's a bit like starting a war in the Middle East under the pretence of stopping terrorism and then showing Tony Blair how much oil you've drilled, d'ya know what I mean?'
4827 2018-03-11 19:59:26 I hope, in the UK (and elsewhere), we'll recognise in time that to not force ourselves to rely on oil and gas would be prudent, and not just for the sake of the environment!..?
4828 2018-03-11 19:59:25 All this dry air is acting up my eczema. Looked into aromatherapy. Conclusion: 10 drops of tea tree oil to every 7.5 oz of cocoa butter Vaseline applied to eczema area twice a day restores skin. #holistic medicine ftw
4829 2018-03-11 19:59:20 I bought a travel essential oil diffuser and it works in my car I'm thriving
4830 2018-03-11 19:58:58 Lol. No kidding.  It’s not a Hot topic to jump on trains carrying oil...
4831 2018-03-11 19:58:50 .@CoreyLaJoie dead silent on radio as he heads to garage and who can blame him, if not an oil line, that's two engine failures in his two starts
4832 2018-03-11 19:58:48 You should ban oil and oil based products in the state of NY.  See how that works for you.
4833 2018-03-11 19:58:31 Well done. I wasn't feeling brave enough to go there without Evening Primrose Oil.
4834 2018-03-11 19:58:22 Hopefully no oil spills on green haha.What a collection of stunning bikes,look even better in the sunlight,what a cracking job you have.
4835 2018-03-11 19:58:02 Lmfao! Mine was beans two weeks back. Thanks goodness it was soft and I already added salt. I just ate the beans like that, no need for oil. 
4836 2018-03-11 19:57:34 Omg it’s literally some cheap packet one!! Argan oil mud. I don’t know the brand. Smells so good though
4837 2018-03-11 19:57:33 HARISSA EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL HOLY SHIT
4838 2018-03-11 19:57:25 Castor oil!!!
4839 2018-03-11 19:57:03 Olive oil fur our Yorkshires today. 
4840 2018-03-11 19:56:54 Ya barber don't respect you if he don't allow you to use all the olive oil  sheen and alcohol you want after your cut done
4841 2018-03-11 19:56:49 The @SearsAuto in Braintree @SouthShorePlaza is terrible. 2.5 hours for an oil change that was scheduled and everyone at the desk ignored us and were rude when they finally spoke @sears #sears #Braintree
4842 2018-03-11 19:56:34 Dear Nina, please add permaculture, circular economies, micro grids, green energy conversion expeditions like @OTEcorporation, for humanity to escape the peak oil Nazis who’ve come to bring destruction in scarcity with automation. When we could become the leisure party.
4843 2018-03-11 19:56:30 I want to know why no one has pursued the use of veg oil
4844 2018-03-11 19:56:22 The last major oil reserves are in the Middle East - both Russia & the US are deciding which puppet regime would best serve their needs..

Return pork to dutch oven. Add liquid 2/3rds up. Cook 2-3 hrs at 350F. Remove and shred (not shown). Brown in oven 'til crisp.
4852 2018-03-11 19:55:20 @cbdbro - are you available for a PM? I have a few questions about your products, type of CBD oil you’re currently using, carrier oil & extraction process. Please let me know the best way to contact you
4853 2018-03-11 19:55:12 Bought some loo roll earlier, made with extracts of coconut oil. 
My bum smells like a Pina Colada.
4854 2018-03-11 19:55:06 oil flowin thru my veins
4855 2018-03-11 19:54:26 sure, he needs to get food for the desperate population, who controls the food controls the people, that is why Russia is there, same as why we fight in the Middle East, who controls the oil controls the world.
4856 2018-03-11 19:54:15 Of course ! Always keep the orange bus of magic fairly clean ! Not bad mate , burning the midnight oil again but happy it's warmed up !

4858 2018-03-11 19:54:02 We usually buy the boneless chicken breast. I toss with oil and seasonings then…
4859 2018-03-11 19:53:54 We were going from the crematorium to have a service at Warwick Bridge for my uncle and on the A69 out of Carlisle the traffic slowed right down. All of a sudden a bull, which had escaped from the nearby auction mart, ran in front of the hearse containing my uncle
4860 2018-03-11 19:53:45 Customer: How much is this fish oil?

Me: $15.99 

Customer: oh wow that’s more expensive than in Davenport. Why is it so high? 

Inner me:  fucking capitalism 

Me: yeah I don’t know who sets the prices
4861 2018-03-11 19:53:44 That land was mostly malarial swamp and desolate desert. No oil! Don't talk unhistorical nonsense. It was considered a desolate land by all who visited it. Even Al Aqsa is a relatively recent site, built literally on top of the Jewish Temple site on Har Ha'Beit
4862 2018-03-11 19:53:38 Mike Birbiglia's (@birbigs) new hour takes a familiar comedy topic and evolves it into something special through personal stories and perfectly delivered punchlines.  Thanks for stopping by at our airport hanger/educational oil space in Calgary! #TheNewOne
4863 2018-03-11 19:53:34 Very humble. I respect your point of view. If the Oilers were in a playoff spot, he would be in the conversation. Due to the rough season for the Oil, other players deserve it more because of the impact they have had on their PLAYOFF bound teams. #Kucherov #McDavid #Hall #NHL
4864 2018-03-11 19:53:26 By a certain climate scientist you mean the overwhelming majority of climate scientists?

The idea that it’s scientists who are lying for profit and not oil companies is so absurd that it boggles the mind.
4865 2018-03-11 19:53:21 Huh? You're making less and less sense.Hydro is *not* carbon-based and *is* renewable but you don't want to count it because it's uninterrupted? This only makes sense if you're a pathetic hack for the Oil and Gas lobby. What a joke. #copolitics
4866 2018-03-11 19:53:13 You can’t get in to Saudi, no tourist visas & you can’t protest anything there but you can protest within Canada against importing their oil.
4867 2018-03-11 19:52:53 Ha-ha, Albera oil will end approximately in 300 years. Eat shit and die MF.

4871 2018-03-11 19:51:50 Most likely full of oil from the North Dakota oil fields, the most flammable crude in North America.
4872 2018-03-11 19:51:35 Actual Foreign Direct Investment (in physical assets) DECLINED by 6% to $982m. Foreign Portfolio Investment which grew 305% is speculative & volatile in nature, now accounts for much of d foreign reserves growth (along with d $5.5b Eurobond loan and oil price doubling since 2015)
4873 2018-03-11 19:51:34 How can one speak so many words and not say anything that makes any sense? Fast talking snake oil salesman! Grifter! Self indulgent pig!!!
4874 2018-03-11 19:51:30 This summer I will be injecting cement, mineral oil and flat-tire sealant into my buttocks to make them curvier. Do not objectify me.

4877 2018-03-11 19:51:08 We are a nation of laws, civility, freedoms, & yet a snake-oil-salesman, whose only claims-to-fame are molesting women, committing Conspiracy, & declaring bankruptcy, somehow slithered his way into the WH, & is in the process of destroying Democracy & stomping on the Constitution
4878 2018-03-11 19:51:07 He, like every soldier before him, is a American hero.

The Vietnam War was a continuation of The Korean War. These wars were against China over controlling Asian coastline, oil and heroin.

Tell your husband. THANK YOU for YOUR SERVICE!
4879 2018-03-11 19:51:07 Volunteering in public schools, I have seen how much teachers have to juggle - understanding and supporting kids, grading homework, mastering subject matter, technology, discipline and more. Adding “using a gun against an active shooter” is like adding oil to water
4880 2018-03-11 19:51:05 Jealousy of a successful business man is one of your problems & will get you nowhere. You are an Obama admirer the worst, most corrupt president to ever hold that office. You are mesmerized by his cool manner but that is a characteristic of someone fooled by a snake oil salesman!
4881 2018-03-11 19:51:03 also heard stories from those working in the gulf oil industry offshore in late 70s  being towed along behind choppers by ex nam pilots
4882 2018-03-11 19:50:59 Oil worked OK too. I’m not great at floor level things.
4883 2018-03-11 19:50:58 "quantum" is thrown around far too much by purveyors of snake oil
4884 2018-03-11 19:50:41 Antioxidant found in oil palm leaf extract more potent than that of green tea. Journal of food processing & technology.
4885 2018-03-11 19:50:32 Miso butter thighs.  Miso paste, butter, honey, sesame oil.  Roasted on a sheet pan.  Perfect.
4886 2018-03-11 19:50:31 And now they are not shipping other products to try and clear the grain backlog. Oil belongs in pipelines, grain, potash, and other products belong on trains
4887 2018-03-11 19:50:25 Nowadays i just enjoy staying up (doing nothing) till 4am to teman my rumet burning the midnite oil
4888 2018-03-11 19:50:08 Judas said Mary’s oil from Alabaster box could be sold for 300 denari.  
That was 1 entire years’ wage.  

Yet he sold Jesus out for 30pcs of silver-the price of a slave.  

What is Jesus worth to you?  Is he worth everything, or is he just “your” slave for what “you” want?
4889 2018-03-11 19:50:04 Not only did IG-88 not find the Millennium Falcon, he also leaked oil all over the bridge floor.
4890 2018-03-11 19:50:02 Whoa, that was fast.

No wonder so many don’t want “America The Beautiful” as national anthem.

“For purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain!”
“Confirm thy soul in self-control.”

Nah, the oil & mining worth too much money. Never mind if all is destroyed in the process.
4891 2018-03-11 19:49:49 Madoda kanti @Mandylisous12_  mtana kabani? Lmao tjooo certified fish oil
4892 2018-03-11 19:49:47 But you have no problem with 42years of PC rule ending with Frank Miller or 40+yrs of PC rule in Alberta. Protect oil interests in the west & status quo here.
4893 2018-03-11 19:49:41 If so then the argument is a technical one well outside Doug's intellectual purview or understanding. No climate scientist accepts that over the past 100 years that Anthropogenic sources are not the dominant causative agent in climate change. Not even scientists at oil companies.
4894 2018-03-11 19:49:20 1. But the oil still are bad with him even if less bad its hard to calculate
2. BUT calculating it...team save pct is near identical w him on ice, so he's just offering points 
3. Other candidates are 60+% of scoring - with more tying AND GWG/assists
4895 2018-03-11 19:49:13 Yes, they will use cheaper steel. They won't spend if they don't have to. There is nothing to suggest that oil companies give a damn about the environment.
4896 2018-03-11 19:49:11 My mum: “I’ll just get another bottle of wine.”
*comes back with a bottle of olive oil*
“Oh.”
4897 2018-03-11 19:48:54 It's because they've sold out to the oil rich Arabs who don't like the hypocrisy of Islam to be uncovered!
4898 2018-03-11 19:48:53 Wowie! My skin feels so soft Nd the tone doesn’t look as uneven??? + the coconut oil I left in my hair over night made my hair so niceeeeee
4899 2018-03-11 19:48:52 A very good snake oil salesman- c u Monday morning
4900 2018-03-11 19:48:51 My coat is lovely and soft now. Perfect for all those vet nurses to stroke me. *coconut and neem oil shampoo* 
4901 2018-03-11 19:48:39 If you ever need a quick lip scrub, combine slightly melted coconut oil & brown sugar 
4902 2018-03-11 19:48:30 This was a classic Trump performance. Selling snake oil to the rubes. Kind of funny that he hardly mentioned the candidate he was supposed to be supporting. I have to admit he is entertaining though.
4903 2018-03-11 19:48:22 Predicting his numbers will mirror John Kasich.
4904 2018-03-11 19:48:13 That’s why I was so frustrated with Starke’s (Lloyd AB and west MLA) epiphany to ship oil via train. 1) backlog of goods 2) Lac Megantic
4905 2018-03-11 19:47:36 #CadetBoneSpurs is starting a trade war ,how many of you remember filling up your cars when the last BILLIONAIRE started a OIL war. This POTUS must be stopped!
4906 2018-03-11 19:47:21 Without this demand from consumers, brands will not be incentivised to highlight the use of sustainable palm oil or use the Trademark 2/2
4907 2018-03-11 19:47:16 Hello, whilst the RSPO advocates for use of the Trademark on pack, displaying this is optional. Consumers can help ensure clearer labeling by letting brands know that there is interest and appetite for the use of sustainable palm oil in products. 1/2
4908 2018-03-11 19:47:15 Drink lots of water, clean off ur makeup with coconut oil. Wash with a face wash for ur skin type, then use a mixture of like 2 drops of tea tree oil and witch hazel , then moisturize. I get the worst breakouts and this has helped me clear up my skin so much
4909 2018-03-11 19:47:00 Getting my oil changed is one of my least favorite activities. Ever. 
4910 2018-03-11 19:46:55 shout out to castor oil
4911 2018-03-11 19:46:51 ((cooking oil. Instead of motor oil

4913 2018-03-11 19:45:52 just drink soybean oil instead.
4914 2018-03-11 19:45:52 #Kurangani #KuranganiForestFire #TheniForestFire Incoming news. Few of the students/people trapped in forest fire sustained more than 80% burns. Poor management of Oil spill issues, Flood disaster, Cyclone disaster and now the legend continues with forest fire too.
4915 2018-03-11 19:45:50 @kyle8edmund Overrated player. Bet you win 1.35, still lost. FFS
4916 2018-03-11 19:45:31 At this rate the environment will be destroyed as quickly as your brain cells. Reviewing your posts, I'd hope you realize all of your medication and material items such as purses use oil. Not to mention the internet and computer you're using. #lookinthemirror
4917 2018-03-11 19:45:30 Keep on reading the express, if we are so subsidised then why do the unionist want to keep us? Maybe all that useless oil, whisky, gin etc?
4918 2018-03-11 19:45:23 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4919 2018-03-11 19:45:23 More evidence Bernie is losing touch with reality.
4920 2018-03-11 19:45:18 It’s lovely though. The olive oil one. And shifts mud. Get some for Mrs D as a Mother’s Day and then keep it.
4921 2018-03-11 19:45:05 It’s basically just receipt paper that zaps all the excess oil from your face. I could make French fries with how oily my skin is so I need them 
4922 2018-03-11 19:45:02 Skylar just called me from the grocery store and asked if I have 2 quarts of vegetable oil because he wants to cook something so now I’m changing my locks.
4923 2018-03-11 19:44:52 One reason is that they count on Big Oil for those full-page ads.  The other is the concentrated ownership.  So little independent reporting.  They are allied with corporations.
4924 2018-03-11 19:44:39 Today I gave my hair some real love and I can see the difference already. I detangled with coconut oil and left it in overnight. I cowashed, deep conditioned and used the LOC method to moisurize. I can't wait to see how this wash n go turns out. I hope it lasts all week!
4925 2018-03-11 19:44:21 No one capable for pm in China.they all live Chinese oil sex massage.look china going down soon.

4929 2018-03-11 19:43:04 There is nothing honorable about you. Moreover, in maligning Jews, you forget that Jesus was a Jew and in doing so you malign him. So much for your claims of being a minister. You're merely another charlatan hiding under the cloak of religion to sell your vituperative snake oil
4930 2018-03-11 19:42:59 Always moisturise never wear a shoe with ashy feet, keep a hand cream in your bag. In that aspirin, lemon juice paste (mentioned by the other lady) add baking powder & olive oil.
4931 2018-03-11 19:42:47 I just used baby oil, my fingers and a lot of Kleenex. #context
4932 2018-03-11 19:42:42 Our roads are so bad it can bend your front end and you're behind in. The roads were paved in front of my house less than 2 years it is already cracking they did not put fresh oil down before they put the asphalt I give it another year and they will be patching our road potholes
4933 2018-03-11 19:42:31 being outside your wisdom

I was the oil and lavender 
but never for you
4934 2018-03-11 19:42:16 Join the club. I suggest an aromatherapy oil massage with lavender essential oil and then curl up with the doggies and sleep lol
4935 2018-03-11 19:41:17 If it is then Big data is the new snake oil.
4936 2018-03-11 19:41:12 When he gets in the car the Check Oil light comes on.
4937 2018-03-11 19:41:11 Love your weeks, it's like Carry on up the Am at times
4938 2018-03-11 19:40:54 It would be more competitive if you weren't chronically underperforming. Then maybe there'd be more than 4 Champions since 2004. Of which two are oil pimps.
4939 2018-03-11 19:40:47 Dry brushed- in the Sun
Now applying the finest Waleda Pomegranate Oil
Bliss! KM
4940 2018-03-11 19:40:45 There absolutely does. Vinegar, water and essential oil mixed into spray bottle cleans brilliantly. There also needs to be more awareness of DIY eco-culture for progressive boycotting of these products.
4941 2018-03-11 19:40:36 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
4942 2018-03-11 19:40:35 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
4943 2018-03-11 19:40:31 I think she has lost any semblance of being unbiased.
4944 2018-03-11 19:40:22 @liamgallagher LG I have some beard oil and beard balm for you, if you every want too spruce up your beard, kents grooming company free for you
4945 2018-03-11 19:40:17 Funerals should be affectionate and not dismal, at most in my family there's usually something to giggle about, like when my dad forgot his grandchildren's names
4946 2018-03-11 19:40:16 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
4947 2018-03-11 19:40:08 You know what, for about a year I've been using raw coconut oil from the local health food store ($11.99) over a retinol from The Ordinary and I like this combo better than anything else I've ever used, including the La Mer I stole from my grandma a few years ago.
4948 2018-03-11 19:39:32 Add candles and some essential oil to the diffuser to take it over the top.
4949 2018-03-11 19:39:10 Lol. In 2008 in a speech to oil execs: “Guess what this liberal would be all about? This liberal would be all about socializing...uh,umm...Would be about, basically, taking over, and the government running all of your companies.”  Yikes  #VeryLowIQ
4950 2018-03-11 19:39:07 Me desperte con unas ganas terribles de tomar licuado de oil
4951 2018-03-11 19:39:01 okay okay. I'm seeing it for cheap on amazon, but everywhere else is charging 20-60 for one ounce. I thought it must be some type of miracle oil.
4952 2018-03-11 19:38:41 Estoy mas despresiva por mañana que las canciones de jesse y joy
4953 2018-03-11 19:38:29 I have a collection of two 100mg CBD oil vape pens, and one single 25mg CBD peach gummy ring and I'm a very relaxed person rn yall.
4954 2018-03-11 19:38:29 Baby oil? What? No no, you use non-ammonia window cleaner!
4955 2018-03-11 19:38:23 Oh! Mostly people now just use hot oil not beef dripping for Yorkshires!!
4956 2018-03-11 19:38:20 Renewable energy creates more job and more energy than all the oil in the world!  Invest in solar and wind fields
4957 2018-03-11 19:38:16 Ok. So far in the migraine battle I have hydrated, put a weird minty oil concoction on the back of my neck, taken a variety of pain relievers,soaked in a hot tub and shaved my legs (that was not for the headache, just regular maintenance). 
I smell good now so that's a plus.
4958 2018-03-11 19:38:13 A) No we don't need oil that long. 
B) Renewable energy is already replacing fossil fuels
C) Fossil fuel industry creates fake wars to get more resources. (WMD)
D) Vaguely mentioning conspiracy theories to try to win
#InvestedInFossilFuels #YouKnowIWon #ThanksForTheEasyWin
4959 2018-03-11 19:38:09 I’m not pro pipeline but I’m not against it either. The oil is going to move either way to the coast. Either rail, truck and or pipeline
4960 2018-03-11 19:37:51 And yet they just hid oil train cars up in the Adirondack national parks on your go ahead.......
4961 2018-03-11 19:37:44 In Saskatchewan we are experiencing massive grain backups  because we are still shipping oil by train, the least efficient way to ship oil, leaving little room for our grain
4962 2018-03-11 19:37:21 I’m fine still working part-time in cake bakery. Still got same cat, Chilli nearly 15 yrs old. You have a cat now, aww! Painting watercolours or oil?
4963 2018-03-11 19:36:57 Feel free to apply that same logic to our political environment, your workplace, just about anywhere… Common sense is not so common as it turns out
4964 2018-03-11 19:36:55 Im just slicker than niggas like olive oil
4965 2018-03-11 19:36:45 And after the people are victorious at stopping the pipeline. A train hauling 40 rail cars of crude oil derails along the Fraser river and dumps thousands of litres into the fast moving river contaminating miles and miles of water into the ocean.
4966 2018-03-11 19:36:16 Awww good  yeah I'd maybe look at getting an oil diffuser? I have a couple and I love them. Makes a world of a difference. Lavender induces relaxation to help sleep!! Maybe rain or relaxing sounds could soothe her as well??
4967 2018-03-11 19:36:12 Yam and oil plus pepper soup, Urhobo man style...
4968 2018-03-11 19:36:07 No quiero que sea lunes.
No quiero volver a la misma rutina aburrida por 9 meses.
No quiero mas materias nuevas.
No quiero comprar libros que vamos a usar solamente tres meses haciendo que tire 400 pe a la basura.
No quiero ver a pendejos que no saben la existencia de un jabon.
4969 2018-03-11 19:36:07 Innit, factor zero oil or go home
4970 2018-03-11 19:36:06 Caulking is extremely not fun. Would have gone completely mad if not for @CubeApril’s baby oil tip.

Caulk sticks to *everything.*
4971 2018-03-11 19:35:57 Turkey and cheese w/ lettuce, tomatoes, salt, pepper & oil/vinegar 
4972 2018-03-11 19:35:54 I used to find that citrus oil was pretty good. Squeeze orange peel. Light it if you're in the mood. Ventilate. That was in the 80s 
4973 2018-03-11 19:35:45 I need to go get some more chi oil
4974 2018-03-11 19:35:23 Does that include oil filled or just battery operated? Asking for a friend.
4975 2018-03-11 19:35:22 Tariff won’t solve it…will just shift costs.  If really wanted to fix it..make China abide by intellectual property and import more oil/gas
4976 2018-03-11 19:35:20 If our entire oil and gas industry was nationalized and owned by the Canadian tax payer instead of foreign companys, would it change your support for pipelines and LNG on the west coast? 

Retweet around.

4978 2018-03-11 19:34:58 keep em long and rub olive oil on them!!
4979 2018-03-11 19:34:20 80% of CBD oil's don't have the amount that the labels/shops put on them.That show on VICE with the Indian looking guy went to many shops in CA,& bought a bunch of differents samples of CBD oil.They took it to a place that tests the samples&none had what they proclaimed to.
4980 2018-03-11 19:34:18 But the UK Gov't tells us: "3. How do you break the rock, does it involve explosives?
There are no explosives used in fracking operations.
The process of preparing any oil or gas well for production involve the use of small shaped charges to “perforate” the steel tubing" 
4981 2018-03-11 19:34:06 get some laxatives Brook luxor castor oil .
4982 2018-03-11 19:34:03 Saya nampak baby oil tuuuu
4983 2018-03-11 19:33:52 actually the only thing i use is tea tree oil from lush and a cheap moisturizer JDHDMDJDK
4984 2018-03-11 19:33:41 It used to be for  oil. How times have changed.
4985 2018-03-11 19:33:39 Kinda depressing don't you think?  How did our country get this way to accept such language?  Snake oil salesman mentality but even more depressing is that he believes what he says and our legislators  go forth with their tails between their legs.
4986 2018-03-11 19:33:23 @G313_ No that Henry Ford Downtown Lol tell oil bro keep Grinding though
4987 2018-03-11 19:33:22 Last coat of Tung Oil done on side one of desk. I'll show a comparison tomorrow.
4988 2018-03-11 19:33:04 not only are climate solutions not bipartisan, the GOP loves climate change. It: 
kills poor people
kills non-whites most
opens more oil drilling
cements wealth inequality
will increase military spending
fuels draconian immigration laws
CC is their ideal candidate
4989 2018-03-11 19:33:02 What quantity of oil was lost in 1996, and at what rate, and how does it compare to this year? Without these numbers this tweet is meaningless.
4990 2018-03-11 19:32:59 vitamin e oil gets rid of scars and stretch marks. research it 
4991 2018-03-11 19:32:54 Not a guru, but a little dab of coconut oil works wonders for me when I get winter skin. If that doesn't work, I'll put straight vitamin e on the really dry spots. I like a cheap aloe vera sheet mask now and again too.
4992 2018-03-11 19:32:53 And the US does NOT get involved simply for other nations political/social injustices it gets involved always because the benefit is always more significant than the loss. One example, do you have any idea how much oil the US has drilled from the Middle East. No? I didnt think so
4993 2018-03-11 19:32:52 just drove a few miles without my oil cap...
4994 2018-03-11 19:32:34 I’ll check it out thank you! I can pretty much only use silicone too, even coconut oil fucks with my ph hella bad :(
4995 2018-03-11 19:31:44 Turkey just supported the Syrian people who wanted freedom , democracy . Usa just wanted oil in southeast Syria and establish a Kurdish state to use it for  strategic plans .
4996 2018-03-11 19:31:37 Well I'd read your blog about pastels, app, oil painting but as you feel offended, I unfollow your Twitter and IG for good.
4997 2018-03-11 19:31:22 Most essential oils u buy at stores are fake and not actual essential oil but lavender does help!! Just make sure it's bought from a credited place 
4998 2018-03-11 19:31:13 Lemon and coconut oil is definitely doing my skin justice by keeping it clean , lightening any blemishes, moisturizing and keeping it glowing 
4999 2018-03-11 19:31:02 I was freakin out bc I was going to send you a pic of my dry oil!!
5000 2018-03-11 19:30:55 I’ve been at Walmart almost 4 hours for an oil change and tire patch up. 
5001 2018-03-11 19:30:40 Has anyone changed oil in something and not made a complete mess?
5002 2018-03-11 19:30:31 Electric.
Hydrogen cell is polluting because it has to burn oil.
Deisel is worse than smoking.
Petrol is polluting & scarfs up the planet.

5006 2018-03-11 19:29:38 Hope you don't mind  little oil on the beach. Oil is cheap. Time to use up other country's reserves, not our own. Leave it the ground until there is a shortage.
5007 2018-03-11 19:29:37 Need a ridiculous amount of Magnesium oil! My back is in bits 
5008 2018-03-11 19:29:36 No African-American will ever win this race. Obama was a wealthy, Hawaiian. Lolo Soetoro, his Indonesian oil exec stepfather was worth more than Trump is now. Obama's high school tuition cost $95K a year.,and Obama, by choice, has never lived in a black neighborhood...
5009 2018-03-11 19:29:31 So I wanna try Rick Simpson oil for my anxiety aches and pains what do you think?
5010 2018-03-11 19:29:20 I refuse to vote for someone who has ever profited from big tobacco or big oil. I also refuse to vote for someone who still hasn’t released their full tax returns.
5011 2018-03-11 19:29:06 I got me some coconut oil  I just showered so it just itches way more

Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
5013 2018-03-11 19:28:30 Ph is the worst. An oil city that has no evidence of oil boom yet plagued with the highest level of thuggery, hooliganism, cultism, environmental pollution and the biggest threat to lives and properties.
5014 2018-03-11 19:28:08 I have talked to some that protest the KM pipeline. They said the next target is rail tankers. They want to shut down ALL oil movement
5015 2018-03-11 19:27:51 Vitamin E oil works wonders
5016 2018-03-11 19:27:43 Snake oil salesman who won't even take a dose of their own poison.

5018 2018-03-11 19:27:39 I lost my oil pen last night 
5019 2018-03-11 19:27:37 You mean being the snake oil salesman that he is.
5020 2018-03-11 19:27:36 Riiiight

Sell off national parks to oil companies

Reduce safety rules of off shore wells

Reduce environment rules on oil & gas wells

Reduce protection for clean air & water

Promote coal that fouls our air & water

And when our resources are gone 
CHINA WILL RULE THE WORLD

5024 2018-03-11 19:27:07 The United States just went from an oil importer to an oil producer, which the Left has been telling me, for the last 30 years, would never happen.

NEVER.

Play the hand you got, not the one you're assuming. It'll go a long way.
5025 2018-03-11 19:26:57 ndhdjssj it's so funny Chloe I eat it all the time but I have never made it myself! Anyway it's currently marinating in some tamari and maple syrup and rice vinegar and sesame oil
5026 2018-03-11 19:26:37 Does anyone know where I can find a list of companies/products that use/have palm oil?

5030 2018-03-11 19:25:16 My point is there r much worse thing than oil. If the environmentalist & SJW are so concerned about the environment&rights they should educate themselves on where is getting its imports from. They should be worried about what is going on globally. They are paid hypocrites
5031 2018-03-11 19:25:16 Ese momento en q te pones a pensar que las vacaciones se pasaron volando y que mañana volves a la rutina de siempre de estar sentadx en un banco sucio teniendo alrededor personas que no conocen el jabon

5036 2018-03-11 19:24:38 You’ll never convince me that French fries are unhealthy. Potatoes, some oil, a little bit of salt. You could do way, way worse
5037 2018-03-11 19:24:26 Seems like u haven't used data sir..

That is why we use averages. UPA had to deal with a global recession & crippling oil prices. NDA had astonishingly low oil prices & no global crisis to deal with. Not to mention the gift of 1.5 - 2 % that came with changing GDP methodology!
5038 2018-03-11 19:24:24 Slice them about 1/2 inch.  Some olive oil spray, salt and pepper.  Grill if you can, roast if you can’t grill.

5044 2018-03-11 19:23:06 Man I can't wait for the day we'll run out of oil.
Solar panels everywhere, more people riding bikes, fresh breathable air, a lot less work, spending time with your family, grow your own food, no idiotic consumerism, less wars...
This list could go on forever. A new renaissance

5055 2018-03-11 19:21:40 One player to consider that has not been mentioned is the State of Washington. They too, are none to pleased about the increased risks of oil spills. Also, I wouldn't rule out the Koch Bro's from secretly funding the environmentalists in order to maintain their discounted pricing
5056 2018-03-11 19:21:38 I hate working on my own car. Honestly takes me a while to finally decide to change my oil or my brakes...

Why though?

5066 2018-03-11 19:19:59 Read the WHO study adopted by UNSCEAR.  There has NEVER been a radiation-related death in a western style nuclear reactor.  Does your funding come from oil companies, be honest, where does your funding come from?
5067 2018-03-11 19:19:46 It's very Bipartisan and therefore Uplifting.  Obama was forced, kicking and screaming, to appoint him.  Same with Rahm.  He had no choice.  His hands were tied.  This was after he "reached across the aisle."  #teachablemoment

5074 2018-03-11 19:18:52 @PierceBrosnan Your portrayal or Eli in @TheSonAMC is phenomenal--engaging, and fierce.  This show should be required viewing for all high school American History students!  To understand the first son, oil baron of Texas,  is to understand our current economic divide in the US!
5075 2018-03-11 19:18:48 no he hasnt but i have not deceived masses by selling them snake oil..and try to fraud their aspirations

5083 2018-03-11 19:16:26 Imagine the futulity of trying to structure a lucky outcome into a series if replicable steps anyone can take to achieve an objective. That is the snake oil 99% of FinTwit is trying to sell you.

5093 2018-03-11 19:15:10 I had an arepa with house made ricotta, duck confit, salsa verde and poached eggs. Gonna post a pic and say it’s an oxtail sope with a jerk egg and parsley oil.

5099 2018-03-11 19:14:17 Every area that the oil and gas industry moves into you see a lot of houses go up for sale. Damn shame the locals have to sell and move.Big corporate greed doesn't care. After all the industry destroys the area they come into so can't blame everyone for moving out.

5105 2018-03-11 19:12:22 There is no sacrifice to economy. Renewable energy would bring more jobs than coal mining and oil rig work. Safer jobs, as well. Also, no hit to your quality of life with battery technology improving. I guess not being selfish, uninformed and shortsighted is “virtue signaling”.
5106 2018-03-11 19:12:00 Recommendation, when purchasing CBD oil do not spend on anything less than 1,000MG. You just don't feel the effects on anything less than 750 and the price difference is worth the upgrade. #cbdheals

5120 2018-03-11 19:09:43 I think perhaps your understanding of what people are protesting isn’t well understood. Not everyone who is protesting is against ALL oil & gas use. Many of us are protesting the approval methods that pipelines go through & the lack of balance in Canada’s energy policy.

5132 2018-03-11 19:07:22 What if we already had the technology for free-energy; but the powers-that-be keep it hidden?  Do some research on this.  IMO We already have the means to be living in a fossil-free energy world but those benefitting from oil production have made sure it hasn’t  happened.

5139 2018-03-11 19:06:04 I’m running low on caster oil. Omg
5140 2018-03-11 19:05:43 For me it's the smell of hot oil. I find it nauseating.
5141 2018-03-11 19:05:41 Lmao. So basically he suggested doing it as a leave in treatment after showering. Or buying the oil product and really massaging it into both the scalp & the ends bc it’ll be less heavy on finer hair.
5142 2018-03-11 19:05:40 Heyy, I’ve made an omelette with olive oil, seasoned with salt and cumin. Then now, I’m frying some tomatoes, with salt, pepper, lemon juice and honey; divine!!! 
5143 2018-03-11 19:05:38 and you call yourself heaven-bound? angels that will give you koboko for your hypocrisy are doing hot press-ups. People should be reminded of their callousness

5145 2018-03-11 19:05:06 My favorite part of the treatment was Jenna’s massage, which she did with a mixture of Alchimie Forever Kantic Brightening moisture mask and Naturopathica Carrot oil. The massage will soften the skin and make it more malleable, hence the extractions easier to perform.
5146 2018-03-11 19:05:06 i’ve been here two hours for an oil change 
5147 2018-03-11 19:05:04 NO!!! You use the gas nozzle. youre car doesnt actually need oil.
5148 2018-03-11 19:05:03 I’m going to get some samples from them and try it out. They sell them in forms of creams and oils. They said oil might be easier for finer hair.

5154 2018-03-11 19:03:50 Right I walked in there to buy oil and they were like is that cash or debit and I was like what did you just ask me?

5157 2018-03-11 19:03:33 Nah. We are the oil companies. Know anyone that owns a 3 barrel per day oil well? I do. It's Alberta.
5158 2018-03-11 19:03:33 They can agree or disagree but OPEC doesn’t get to set the price of oil anymore!  They’re a toothless tiger.  The US is a mega-producer once again.  F’k OPEC!  They’re a criminal cartel made up of bigots.  MAGA!

5167 2018-03-11 19:02:02 USA dollars funding Cdn protestors is foreign interference in Cdn resource development and Cdn politics.  Foreign dollars in oil corporation is a business agreement that does not have any effect on Cdn political decisions.  If you fail to see the difference, I feel sorry for you.

5178 2018-03-11 19:00:53 cbd oil? since when?
5179 2018-03-11 19:00:25 This is how the enviros (Warren Buffets best friends a.k.a usefull idiots) want the oil industry to transport oil. In all my years working in the industry, we know, absolutely know this is not a safe way to transport oil.

5183 2018-03-11 19:00:14 I need some weed, or an oil cartridge..
5184 2018-03-11 19:00:08 Nothin worse than waking up with no intentions to spend p , then boom £40 to change your front tyre  and engine coolant is  low and more oil needed 
5185 2018-03-11 18:59:51 Emen. Be on watch, on Guard. Don't be caught unawares like them five non wise maidens who didn't have oil in their lamps.
5186 2018-03-11 18:59:46 My mom bike her arm very badly a few months back. Her Dr. recommend CBD oil, which is a derivative of marijuana but, does not have THC in it. It has helped significantly with bone growth. She also has dementia & the CBD oil helps her relax when she becomes confused. So beneficial
5187 2018-03-11 18:59:31 ahhhh maybe that’s what I need to so bc I tend to oil last
5188 2018-03-11 18:59:27 So if an oil executive drives a hybrid vehicle, should that discredit him from his ability to run a business? Your logic is very black and white. A protest is not a trade show to showcase emerging technologies, it’s a way for average citizens to express their views.
5189 2018-03-11 18:59:22 Definitely try color remover first? Then if there's color left, try the coconut oil.
5190 2018-03-11 18:59:22 Add oil bae
5191 2018-03-11 18:59:17 Yes I agree, both processes are dirty. I certainly will not advocate that the other option is good either. At this point though, ev could not be manufactured without the use of oil.
5192 2018-03-11 18:59:15 I have ditched Magnolia tissue oil and bought Portia M morula oil. Maaaan I’m very happy!! It’s been 2 weeks and I can see difference. I didn’t mix it with my body lotion I want it to work on it’s own  #GirlTalkZA
5193 2018-03-11 18:59:00 Me and @BridgetYassme also decided that’s a lie too sis lol I been using peppermint and tea tree oil for yearSS. These homeopathic hair methods are a scam and I’m ova it !

5195 2018-03-11 18:58:45 From my own experience anti acids made my reflux worse, I've had IBS all my life. Anti spasmodics and peppermint oil are the only things that have really helped but everyone is different.
5196 2018-03-11 18:58:35 I agree. Also without its use as  fuel, oil is heavily intertwined in our everyday day life.

5199 2018-03-11 18:58:01 ok, yeah i've used the banding method too. i do like that also. Oil, Cream, Gel is the order i go in. i think it does make a difference the order u put the products. putting oil on last makes my hair frizz. it's all trial and error.

5202 2018-03-11 18:57:38 Melt some coconut oil, dip a qtip in it and coat the insides of your nostrils.  Seems gross but is helpful and of course HUMIDIFIER.

Divergences like spx and oil last week have a funny way of convergening to the Bulls favor.  Is this not one of those times since volume cannot be faked or manipulated?
However fomo will happen if we rip

5212 2018-03-11 18:55:20 Incase any one suffers from crappy migraines like I do if you take a shower and mix peppermint oil in with your shampoo and conditioner it works wonders.

5217 2018-03-11 18:54:19 In his defense, net neutrality is only a few years old. He can't envision what the world was like before then, but let's trust him on the wisdom of the founders.
5218 2018-03-11 18:54:03 Well my hair’s too tough to comb all at once and parting it with a comb is painful. So I use a detangler by Shea Moisture to make it a bit soft and then I part it with my fingers. Then I wet that bit with a mix of water and coconut oil and I add a bit more of the detangler.
5219 2018-03-11 18:53:58 I put so much oil on,you could fry an egg on my legs lmaoo
5220 2018-03-11 18:53:07 I also heard about oil trading. But russians served this news to all over world. How reliable I dont know. By the way I’m not an erdogan supporter.
5221 2018-03-11 18:52:59 portishead and clove oil
5222 2018-03-11 18:52:51 You won’t have to get it changed as often as regular oil either.
5223 2018-03-11 18:52:49 I cook mine With garlic and olive oil
5224 2018-03-11 18:52:35 I don't know if my tea tree oil blemish stick works, but I know that the pain makes me feel better about the ugliness. Cosmetics at their most Catholic.
5225 2018-03-11 18:52:11 What do you mean, isn't that how you change oil? Just sprinkle it on.
5226 2018-03-11 18:52:00 @OfficeOfRG @narendramodi Rahul g jra ye oil use karo...shayad dil ka dard dur ho jayega aur modi-modi nhi karoge.
5227 2018-03-11 18:51:53 Oil changed!
5228 2018-03-11 18:51:40 When Pres Trump calls for the execution of drug dealers does he realize that is unconstitutional?
Or is he just selling snake oil to the masses?
5229 2018-03-11 18:51:36 HeilHogg.
5230 2018-03-11 18:51:34 I think me half cut and hot oil is probably a bad idea
5231 2018-03-11 18:51:28 Yes... oil your scalp too
5232 2018-03-11 18:51:26 That looked like blood dripping and not syrup or motor oil. #Bruins have to finish short-handed
5233 2018-03-11 18:51:19 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む

5234 2018-03-11 18:51:03 Yea it is. You gotta stuck with one oil lol. You can’t be be switching it up. Go synthetic from now on.  It’s better anyway.
5235 2018-03-11 18:51:00 2 pipelines, one for oil and one for grain...the grain one was talked about 10 years ago
5236 2018-03-11 18:50:56 from now on? i'm using butter and coconut oil to fry and extra virgin olive oil for low heat cooking. just gotta wait for my pufa vegetable oil bottle to finish

5238 2018-03-11 18:50:39 Sometimes when you are too generous some people would want to take you as a fool #oil and gas friends
5239 2018-03-11 18:50:37 @FiberOne Please stop using Palm Oil! You can use other ingredients that won't result in the death of animals! Please!
5240 2018-03-11 18:50:37 Right After Iran announce to ease oil production to handicap Us shale oil production, America can’t have that, can’t beat’em then kill’em , that’s our real motto in America.
5241 2018-03-11 18:50:30 I make beard oil upon request!
5242 2018-03-11 18:50:29 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
5243 2018-03-11 18:50:17 The revenue has to come from oil/gas industry! Iv lives in Duncan for 20 years. This town has had its dealings with Halliburton.
5244 2018-03-11 18:49:42 Tell All. On (Easter Sunday). A 1 of A Kind Never Seen Before In History. Oil On Canvas Masterpiece of "Jesus Christ" Will Be Unveiled.
5245 2018-03-11 18:49:39 What’s the best product for dry, brittle 4C hair ? It feels like no matter how much i oil my scalp it’s still dry and brittle 
5246 2018-03-11 18:49:38 Fuck oil and gas companies. This is our earth. Not theirs. Simple as that. Keep up the good fight.
5247 2018-03-11 18:49:29 My hair is braided on singles. Can I put leave in conditioner and coconut oil in my braids 
5248 2018-03-11 18:49:27 WHAT YOU HEAR PRESIDENT ABOUT THE COMMUNIST MADURO IN VENEZUELA ARE NO FAKE NEWS SIR,PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO HELP US LIKE FOR EXAMPLE STOP BUYING OIL FROM HIM,THANKS!
5249 2018-03-11 18:49:16  What is the jab jab uniform. Ole oil and a dirty thong #Soca #SocaIsLife
Take me back to #SpiceMas2017
I so wish I was going for #SpiceMas2018 
5250 2018-03-11 18:48:43 which eco style gel is better?
I’ve been using the olive oil one & the Castor oil/flaxseed (which i dont really like), but there’s like 10 others and i’m about to go buy another jar.
5251 2018-03-11 18:48:38 Worse, yes. 

A LOT worse, not sure. 

Domestically it may not seem as bad but globally.... same people backing Obama drove oil projects in Canada - arguably worse for the planet - and abroad.
5252 2018-03-11 18:48:25 2 months of patience and coconut oil 
5253 2018-03-11 18:48:03 I'm using Portia M marula skin oil. It's so much better for my skin
5254 2018-03-11 18:47:58 I use a combination of Sea Salt and Olive Oil. You have to rub it in. If you go to Munich when you are working Aumeister has the best Schweinekrustenbraten I have ever had. All their food is great.
5255 2018-03-11 18:47:54 No excuse lol all you need is a drip pan, old oil spills out, close it, add new oil, boom. And if you need a filter change that’s 2-7 minutes Max lol
5256 2018-03-11 18:47:42 my body adjusted to the oil in the T
5257 2018-03-11 18:47:41 Kaio you know, oil

5259 2018-03-11 18:47:11 .@paulrust Bertie birthday episode of @love was stellar. We have a couple notes:
1. The crab legs joke is killer.
2. Whoever made the creative decision to have the hairy Viking wrestler oil up in the background...give them a raise. It was a bold choice that paid off.
3. Thank you
5260 2018-03-11 18:46:39 The plot thickens....like sewage in an oil spill.
5261 2018-03-11 18:46:37 It’s a pretentious thing personal I love cathartic feeling of wracking with the back of the knife and using salt to chop it up but the truth is the garlic press releases oil in a better fashion without leaving so much on the board. Use what works for you, ignore the rest.
5262 2018-03-11 18:46:29 Honestly thank god for CBD oil... no better way to come down from an anxiety attack #MedicalMarijuana
5263 2018-03-11 18:46:26 Truffle oil will change the way you eat pizza
5264 2018-03-11 18:46:21 If any of my friends haven’t tried Oil Spill Restaurant in Madill y’all are missing out. It’s the best little café located in the town square!
5265 2018-03-11 18:46:18 Mushrooms (garlic, oil and parsley), polenta (some slices cooked with mozzarella and mushrooms on top) and mashed potatoes cooked with onions and herbs is all I ate today
A beer goes well with all that
5266 2018-03-11 18:46:17 It’s something about that oil ling ling put on my face after she do my eyebrows, always clear my face up in minutes. Ima have to holla at her about that. 
5267 2018-03-11 18:45:46 Combine 2 tablespoons ice cream with 2 1/2 pints halibut. Blend with Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve in 3 inch slices
5268 2018-03-11 18:45:18 Indeed. But even when the Roman Empire collapsed, it didn't take China or the Mayans down with it, & technology dependence was far lower. Remove oil supplies & electricity generation from our society today & we have a huge distance to fall.
5269 2018-03-11 18:45:15 Wonder how many more off days it'll take before your fanbase goes back to the 10 fans that were there before the oil money
5270 2018-03-11 18:44:36 When he says: " btw mhi a come fi come kill u and the pussy cause mhi oil a turn butter "
5271 2018-03-11 18:44:35 Brandy wanted to show me the gift her dad got her because she’s been going thru a lot of shit lately and I was expecting it to be flowers or something like that but she just fucking whips out a bottle of CBD oil shdhchddhshsh
5272 2018-03-11 18:44:31 I need some fish oil
5273 2018-03-11 18:44:25 Some advocate heating the oil up - prob not a bad idea to hit 80C for safety, but it seems to work pretty well for me so far (not much proof of anything I suppose).
5274 2018-03-11 18:44:25 RT @NicolasMaduro: The art of revolutionary politics is to keep the balance in all circumstances and to know how to go forward. The oil price is stable, and the Petro has hit hard. In the pre-sale of the Petro, we already have 5 billion dollars, we are on course to prosperity.
5275 2018-03-11 18:44:15 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
5276 2018-03-11 18:44:15 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5277 2018-03-11 18:44:03 i know i'm not a car mechanic but in NO WORLD should it take two hours to change the oil in my car, right? 
5278 2018-03-11 18:43:52 Charcoal was always more efficient than oil and coal though. It's only gotten moreso. 

And we've had industrial level solar power generation since like the late 1800s.

5280 2018-03-11 18:43:13 Answer... Selling "snake oil" in South Central LA for 25 years.  Same way Charlie Rangel got rich in Harlem.  Sheila J-Lee down in Houston...
5281 2018-03-11 18:42:32 Business is like Water and Pleasure is like Oil. Dem nuh bbc mix!
5282 2018-03-11 18:42:29 I remember the campaign in costal Mississippi “Keep our coast beautiful.” So dumb. Would of added 1000’s of local jobs other than the oil jobs themselves to the local area. Mississippis economy would of had a jump it has needed (still needs) for decades.
5283 2018-03-11 18:42:15 Plus more people every day are driving electric or hybrid cars, using mass transit, installing solar panels on their homes, converting to natural gas from oil, etc. etc.
5284 2018-03-11 18:42:14 Jerk chicken x agave and ginger oil fried rice x sautéed carrots x roasted plantain puree...good Sunday
5285 2018-03-11 18:41:57 @Resource_Works Even if all vehicles are electric, Vancouver still needs oil for its airports
5286 2018-03-11 18:41:42 Just got a new face oil and I'm in love 
5287 2018-03-11 18:41:18 a wise man once said that when DonaldTrump cries about #CNN being unfair, a russian bot whispers #covfefe
5288 2018-03-11 18:41:15 Fammmm

Yoruba mom go just bring out anointing oil from God knows where.
5289 2018-03-11 18:40:52 I use coconut oil and shea butter. I moisturize my hair twice a week. I haven’t had my hair made for over a month now, I’ve just had them in two cornrows.
5290 2018-03-11 18:40:50 Not sure what meds you are on but try peppermint oil capsules (200mg if possible) as for meds Omeprazole and Mebeverine if you've not been prescribed yet. Charcoal capsules might also help.
5291 2018-03-11 18:40:42 Yep, he pissed off a lot of people in the oil business last week.
5292 2018-03-11 18:40:40 Anyone who is successful stole it. Any one who has anything in life is corrupt. These are the people who are selling snake oil, and they sell it because they fail in their own lives. Sad!
5293 2018-03-11 18:40:26 But on a bright note, my whole room is scented evenly ever since I started burning perfume oil instead of incense.
5294 2018-03-11 18:40:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
5295 2018-03-11 18:40:02 Oh, and oil, of course. You need something to cook the Big Macs in.
5296 2018-03-11 18:39:56 Quick sell your car and everything you own that’s plastic!! Then we won’t need oil anymore!!

5299 2018-03-11 18:39:49 INsurance should be catastrophic and normal visits and checkups cash pay. You free loaders want EVERYTHING to be paid for AND for insurance to be cheap.  Imagine if car insurance paid for every oil change.  Get your act together and think!
5300 2018-03-11 18:39:36 Okay, this country is so sick!  How can water look like used oil? @nemaug has really failed this nation. #NTVPanorama

5303 2018-03-11 18:39:15 In the long run, they need to invest in domestic value/job creation once the oil runs out but long-term fx hedges &/or long-tear, foreign currency denominated debt issuance wld help
5304 2018-03-11 18:39:12 pero es que si Maduro no ganase en Mayo (jejeje), igual gobernaría hasta diciembre- enero ¿no?
5305 2018-03-11 18:38:56 Dr. Jessica Jewell to me in an interview: Electrical gen/distribution will be first to de-carbonize, transportation will be last. Until there is a cost-competitive alternative to gasoline, oil consumption will continue to grow. One expert's take on the Energy Transition...

5308 2018-03-11 18:37:51 Thanks bud 80 % of oil fans are delusional
5309 2018-03-11 18:37:46 So, when flaming hot oil spits onto your arm as you are carrying a heavy pan with both hands, it's still - it turns out - dumb to quickly lick the oil off with your tongue.
5310 2018-03-11 18:37:45 Need to go get a oil change
5311 2018-03-11 18:37:32 In the meantime, there's enough conventional oil in the world.
5312 2018-03-11 18:37:25 Cooking oil
5313 2018-03-11 18:37:22 Well, have you heard the one about a peaceful underground nuclear explosion used in oil exploration causing an earthquake in Haiti?  No?  Well, you really should get out more.  Or take a break from vid games & read.
5314 2018-03-11 18:37:12 Skipped my caster oil treatment .. already i feel like njoko is about to RKO me
5315 2018-03-11 18:37:10 The oil was also used to destroy the miners & unions.
5316 2018-03-11 18:37:05 I bought the Jamaican Black Castor Oil deep conditioner since I already have the shampoo/conditioner and the olive&green tea soap.
5317 2018-03-11 18:36:44 Well Alberta should shut down their oil supply and they can go back to the dark ages they wish for.
5318 2018-03-11 18:36:24 For me it's not just the astoundingly insane things, it's that mainstream media ignores them, and we're expected to take her seriously.
5319 2018-03-11 18:36:16 Jordan Called Me Just To Show Me How To Change Oil & Honestly I Just Fell In Love With Him All Over Again 
5320 2018-03-11 18:36:13 What are you a Luddite? Whale oil heats your home, candles for light, wood for the steam locomotives. #Efficientenergy
5321 2018-03-11 18:36:10 Don’t forget the oil 
5322 2018-03-11 18:36:08 Not only for the oil...''In the year 2000 there were 7 countries without a Rothchild owned or controls central bank: Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, Iran. In 2011 only 3 left: Cuba, North Korea and Iran.'' And look whats happening in those countries now!
5323 2018-03-11 18:36:04 The Oil & Gas industry’s misinformation campaign, 100s of lobbyists at #okleg, & legions of paid off public officials (perfectly legal & disturbing) combine to obfuscate its mind-blowing hypocrisy on taxes, incentives & education funding. Its attacks on #renewables are absurd.

5334 2018-03-11 18:34:34 got a pen with 90% thc oil in it from someone at work. hoooooooked UP.
5335 2018-03-11 18:34:28 A quick reminder that refining gasoline from crude oil is often an energy negative process.

There is a myth that we need fossil fuels for an industrial and post-industrial society. It's a myth perpetrated by people who like to own long energy supply chains.
5336 2018-03-11 18:34:22 my hair is especially soft today thank you olive oil
5337 2018-03-11 18:34:21 Far left mob? Or people who remember what was once a pro labor pro farmer pro middle class anti war left of center Democrat- before hijacking by southern ‘democrats’ infused with oil $ to preserve the colonial imperialists global profiteering?
5338 2018-03-11 18:34:15 Living next to the CN mainline, believe me, we are acutely aware of the thundering high speed oil trains. 

It a matter of when not if they come off the rails.

5344 2018-03-11 18:33:56 4/6

... science advances like other countries did with an exception of having oil to sell and more money to buy new technologies faster.

A kingdom fall cost trillions of dollars. A Republic system refreshes every 4 years and costs less blood and money to fall.

5353 2018-03-11 18:32:55 According to some German dudes and then Arroyo, it can reveal the presence of rum oil by destroying other congeners, a sort of aroma subtraction.
5354 2018-03-11 18:32:49 Maris Piper only. Keep them boiling for 15 mins in heavily salted water. Lightly ruffle.  Oven at 200, heat oil for 10 mins(sunflower or veg is fine) baste when first in pan, turn after 20 mins and baste again. Should be done after another 20-25 mins. Nowt fancy
5355 2018-03-11 18:32:48 I love beets. Roasted with a little olive oil, S&P. Or pickled. Saw some other recipes I’m gonna try on the other thread too. So good, but I respect your tastes, friend.

5357 2018-03-11 18:32:43 Edamame, fresh pineapple, sushi ginger, purple onion, green onion, dried chilies, broiled salmon ... melange. Dressing: fresh ginger, blossom honey, rice wine vinegar, black sesame oil, juice from pineapple

5358 2018-03-11 18:32:12 Complete with links to the early massacres perpetrated by the Assad regime.  He answered his own question with "there's no oil in Syria!".  When eventually Obama vaguely went "that's quite enough of war crimes in Syria", this geezer changed his tune *overnight* to... (2)
5359 2018-03-11 18:31:48 Im missing the mountains of Scotland, Wales has some lovely beaches, and a lot of oil refineries!
5360 2018-03-11 18:31:42 alright i need feedback on jamaican black castor oil.. i've heard it works wonders for lash growth. anyone on my TL tried it? is it worth the price?
5361 2018-03-11 18:31:35 Following the money has never been wrong either and when it comes to money laundering and oil Trump's prints are all over it I don't need Wikileaks to tell me that
5362 2018-03-11 18:31:21 Does any oner know if city water is safe to drink due to oil spill on GE Property thanks
5363 2018-03-11 18:31:19 Oh!! Thank you!! I have lemon ginger tea! And I’ve heard good things about lavender oil, I think i’m going to pick some up
5364 2018-03-11 18:31:18 I like the oil up version, but if I'm the pan, that means I'm hot as heck :D
Right? ...
5365 2018-03-11 18:31:08 If it's anything like the UK. There are hydrogen fuel cell cars available. All that's needed is someone to build the infrastructure of refuelling stations. It's a risk that big business especially big oil seems averse to taking.
5366 2018-03-11 18:31:05 Gotta take this oil pan off a fucking gain
5367 2018-03-11 18:30:46 Funniest thing in DC this week?  @SecretaryPerry going to a conference on "future energy innovations." Would have been better suited if he went to a "Back to Whale Blubber Lamp Oil" confab.
5368 2018-03-11 18:30:17 Thank you very much. Would coconut oil also work
5369 2018-03-11 18:30:12 When the LORD ask us to judge their fruit we think of amount of fruit, true but there is what kind of fruit are they, apple, fig, grape, oil or cedars what? Judging it to know what your calling is by YOUR type of fruit. Just a thought.

5371 2018-03-11 18:30:09 What a complete dweeb lets put thousands of lives at risk millions more at risk of loss of livlihood an entire aquatic water system at risk for a few oil patch jobs not the sharpest pencil are you
5372 2018-03-11 18:30:00 Ok, so how do you get the crackling to crisp up? Is it salt or oil that you rub into the skin?
5373 2018-03-11 18:29:58 Everyday essential oil kits 10% off ends today. Let me help you get a start on your oily journey!!
5374 2018-03-11 18:29:54 Yeah, I've been looking for a replacement for Aveda's Blue Oil since they replaced it with a crappier version. This one has beeswax and safflower oil. I'd use Tiger Balm if it didn't burn my skin.
5375 2018-03-11 18:29:52 And?  He's developing green technology & infrastructure that's weaning us off our addiction to oil.

Unlike most big corporations, @Tesla actually deserves it.
5376 2018-03-11 18:29:50 Re: Protect the planet sign - yet all those clothes, signs, chairs, etc were made and transported with oil. Hmm lol
5377 2018-03-11 18:29:43 making swords out of people seem more plausible than using them as a power source (except if you pretend to turn them into animal oil to burn)
5378 2018-03-11 18:29:29 Lavender essential oil is rlly helpful for my anxiety. I rub some on my temples. Also a tea with lemon and ginger can soothe stomach aches
5379 2018-03-11 18:29:25 Yeh I agree about the face masks... I make my own using yr bentonite clay and tea tree oil with a bit of ACV.
I lovely I have moringa oil already, I will pick up the other suggestions.
Do u jus apply them to the skin as moisturiser or make up a mask...?
5380 2018-03-11 18:29:20 Olive oil & 2 eggs leave it for at least half hour. Coconut oil and avocado, do the same. Castor oil is also good if u mix it with honey
5381 2018-03-11 18:29:14 So @ctoverdrive, where is our Canada Provincial Political Rankings this week?! #OntarioPC Leadership going against #Alberta shutting off oil Tap?!
Bloc Québécois could get in there too I’m sure - thanks #Quebec!
5382 2018-03-11 18:29:12 I love the way sesame oil smells
5383 2018-03-11 18:29:01 @DeliliaOMalley He's not a politician. He's a snake oil salesman who uses slithery skins of cronies. No wonder we're sick.
5384 2018-03-11 18:28:31 Yaaaasssss! That Black Castor and Flaxseed Oil Gel is so Bae 
5385 2018-03-11 18:28:25 Putting on baby oil fresh out the  >>>>
5386 2018-03-11 18:28:17 "Don't change your oil"
5387 2018-03-11 18:28:16 Interesting article, I have my disagreements w/ @POTUS especially his catering to special interests as the gas/oil & mining industries, also he needs to weigh his words b/4 speaking out & his lack of interest in protecting our natural resources, parks, & monuments.
5388 2018-03-11 18:28:15 Not sure you can call the automobile market "free" when oil is heavily subsidized and road is are free.
Governments have been running pump and dump scams with fiat for over a century without going to jail too. How do you think banks own the biggest buildings in every city?
5389 2018-03-11 18:27:58 It helps with weight loss. It’s super duper coconut oil.
5390 2018-03-11 18:27:55 Your hair is still short, I suggest you buy castor oil for now mix with water and spray everyday. Do braids then after you can decide on products. Black pearl is good and affordable. Try Native Child products very cheap from Jetmart stores 
5391 2018-03-11 18:27:55 In the near future, alternative energy will be the new oil.
5392 2018-03-11 18:27:25 What’s in my SprayLeave in Bottle?

What products are you going to be using to moisturize this week?
5393 2018-03-11 18:27:25 and I just woke up to check my email and see he made the both of us oil change appointments  I DO NOT DESERVE THIS MAN
5394 2018-03-11 18:27:09 No he's not he's a snake oil salesmen. Intellectuals can be some of the greatest liars and Bullshit artists out there. And Peterson is one of them.
5395 2018-03-11 18:26:55 I thought it was to save the whales by not using so much whale oil in lamps
5396 2018-03-11 18:26:53 It’s not proven that they lied. It could’ve been faulty intelligence. Or it could’ve been Bush who lied about the intelligence.

But assuming they lied, they would’ve done it for the oil. What benefit would there be going to war with a nuclear capable Russia?
5397 2018-03-11 18:26:50 I'm sitting here watching an oil train go west to BC #yeg #yyc #yql #yvr #bcpoli #ableg
5398 2018-03-11 18:26:35 Have you ever tried CBD Oil? 
1)yes 
2)no 
3) Interested, want more info!
5399 2018-03-11 18:26:33 so either the frying pan is trying to tell you "ITS TIME TO OIL UP YEENBOY" or the kitchen has rearranged its rules and you are now the pan!
5400 2018-03-11 18:26:22 Five Points Pale on tap kept me happy, also had Beavertown Neck Oil
5401 2018-03-11 18:26:19 91.3FM The Edge is playing "Oil And Water [Album Version]" by Incubus.
5402 2018-03-11 18:26:17 #Afrin shows the clear limits of American support to #Kurds. It is entirely about Kurds serving American masters. The American regime will itself start killing the Kurds once it makes up a new fake faction to support its conquest of oil in Syria.
5403 2018-03-11 18:26:15 Oh so oil is only OK when it's convenient for you then? If the argument is about the environment then how come nolobody is speaking about the deforestation from bc orgs that are raping the Athabasca forests? Or the sewage dumping in the coast? Want me to continue?
5404 2018-03-11 18:26:07 หุหุๆ
5405 2018-03-11 18:26:05 I believe, but am possibly incorrect, that the US is now producing a massive amount of oil, and doesn’t actually need our “oil” but since we are willing to sell it to them at a steep discount they take it. I’d love to know how much oil produced in Canada is used in Canada.
5406 2018-03-11 18:25:37 @POTUS - will never address this as his pockets are lined by coal, oil and gas lobbies
5407 2018-03-11 18:25:24 Why do the guys at autozone gotta know if my truck is 2 or 4 wheel drive. All i needed was an oil filter. I could ask for a cabin light and still get asked what drivetrain i have

5412 2018-03-11 18:24:50 Oh, you Brussel sprouts haters!!! Cut them in half, lay in a roasting pan, dice onion and bacon, drizzle w/olive oil, some S & P, then bake at 350 for about 45 min, flipping them once 1/2 way through cooking time. YUM! They come out of oven tasting mild and sweet.
5413 2018-03-11 18:24:46 So the castor oil with also help with untangling my heir
5414 2018-03-11 18:24:43 You can put some old motor oil (black stuff) on it, paint it on with an old paint brush.  Seems to have worked for us in the past ands it cheap
5415 2018-03-11 18:24:40 @JenniferPerillo Have you tested/used @Costco organic butter? That is what I use almost exclusively. Curious as to how it compares to others. My favorite trick is to whip 2 sticks of softened butter with 1/3 cup avocado oil to make a spreadable butter.
5416 2018-03-11 18:24:38 Joan mcalpine on bbc scotland news, she is no oil painting
5417 2018-03-11 18:24:31 And UPA did what it did when oil prices all time high and the world economy is derail mode. Check ur facts also sir. And here 4 yrs the oil was at its lowest and we were looted with no benefits
5418 2018-03-11 18:24:20 He knows it all@andrewrawnsley as he prepares the way (Observer) for the cobra attack of Nick Cohen. He sees Corbyn and other so-called populists as ' peddlers of snake oil' 
Is he fearful of losing his boring status of having to promote his boring status.?
5419 2018-03-11 18:24:13 แอดคนนี้ไม้กุ้งจ่ะ คริ
5420 2018-03-11 18:24:07 To prevent an American company from profiting off Canadian oil? Where is your logic? That doesn't make sense.
5421 2018-03-11 18:24:03 Sigh.  Oil has. built a big part of our water infrastructure.  And is desperately needed by impoverished countries to help build their infrastructure. But political elitists don’t care about the billions of energy impoverished alive today.
5422 2018-03-11 18:24:02 Ain’t this the same guy who poured hot oil on his junk n shoved a banana up his ass

5426 2018-03-11 18:23:00 Acquisition culture is prevalent in the oil and gas industry - new and junior companies seek only to get acquired.

5428 2018-03-11 18:22:45 Fellow Nigerians, especially journalists who determine the headlines we see; distributing vegetable oil, small bags of rice and some cash to women or youth is not EMPOWERMENT! It is SLAVERY! Empowerment is teaching them to fish, not giving them fish.Let's get the headlines right!

5436 2018-03-11 18:21:26 This should be proof to people how much big oil influences our politicians no other companies seem to have that power over them you don't hear Walmart trying to get Rachel notley to go to war for them

5450 2018-03-11 18:19:53 Zinke wants oil/gas drilling on all coasts...except Florida, ‘cause tourists, like no other coastal state has beaches that draw tourists...and Mar-a-Lago. Then he goes on to lie about Obama, the Repubs favorite hobby and whipping boy.
5451 2018-03-11 18:19:31 Low prices cause lower prices. But to speculate:
1. Abundance of cheap natural gas
2. USA, the undisputed no. 1 market influencer, doesn’t have a strategic advantage with U as opposed to oil
3. Thorium threat lurking
4. No demand outside of existing 10yr old future contracts
5452 2018-03-11 18:19:13 Great article! Interesting how he's going for reform in both domestic and trade issues. And the shift doesn't seem to be in favour of local industries (like oil or asbestos), I'm worries our economy won't be able to handle it, a lot of people rely on these jobs
5453 2018-03-11 18:19:10 So you took a ferry - which was manufactured and heavily uses oil to function - to stop the flow oil? Then you used a computer and internet which also heavily relies on oil to brag about it? LOL WHAT?
5454 2018-03-11 18:19:00 Just one more thing for the US to Lag Behind the rest of the world in! Ignorance is No Excuse! RENEWABLES EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE THAN OIL OR GAS! WE NEED TO DO MORE!
5455 2018-03-11 18:18:48 Nobody wants pipelines or oil trains but everyone want to fill their vehicles with gasoline or diesel fuel. Go figure.  $1.50 a litre :)
5456 2018-03-11 18:18:24 If you go to businesses repetitively with the sole intention of accusing innocent workers and an entire establishment for racial profiling with the end goal being to shut them down and all they did was ask for ID you should be sucking the shit your full of through an oil funnel.

5459 2018-03-11 18:17:56 This is what small manufacturers face. We have 50 employees that depend on their jobs and we can’t compete with aluminum Chinese Radiators, air coolers and oil coolers. Too cheap!! It was bad before, now worse!! Raw materials going up!! We need fair trade!!
5460 2018-03-11 18:17:53 Yup most of these have silicone so can't be used with toys and the other one is oil based.

He's probably to frightened of change to go back to school & get work in renewable energy. 
Instead he screams at people on the
5467 2018-03-11 18:17:02 If you get like a good moisturizer, your oil production would calm down a lot
5468 2018-03-11 18:16:56 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about a paleo-keto-raw diet and vaginal jade eggs. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.
5469 2018-03-11 18:16:37 It is better to burn the midnight oil now rather than delaying things until you have piles of work to do which stressing you out.
5470 2018-03-11 18:16:32 LITERALLY my mentality!!! also last night i put coconut oil and a hair mask and castol oil all over my hair n slept in it in hopes that today it'll be easier to continue to detangle. i havent tried yet but wil let u kno. also my neck is broken out bc im allergic to coconut oil

He also fries bacon in oil. 

I could go on but I'm only ranting bc he's frying in the kitchen and I can't get food yet.

Informed the people about how we have burnt midnight oil to serve them, day in and day out. Politics means service to the people on the ground & change is about delivering.
5486 2018-03-11 18:14:29 Oh like these gems. If you like your Dr you can keep your Dr. If you like your plan you can keep your plan. No scandal with the IRS. I didn’t know about Hillary E-Mail server. I didn’t call Islamic State a JV team. The Keystone pipeline is for oil bypassing the US. Many too list!
5487 2018-03-11 18:14:17 This poor Conners fellow is 3 shots into his final round and already leaking massive amounts of oil. Tiger factor not ideal when trying to win your first ever event.
5488 2018-03-11 18:14:14 Lol, you're posting an article from an oil corporation. That's convincing.
5489 2018-03-11 18:13:58 "He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil —the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you"

5490 2018-03-11 18:13:47 Nukes and weapons stores under the hills by Loch Long, troop training by NATO in the Highlands, percentage of Scots in their army's, land for shooting game, whisky and oil to bring up the trade balance, oil to tax at Corp and fuel levy, fishing to sell out, wind energy...
5491 2018-03-11 18:13:44 MY BROTHER THREW SO MUCH CANNABIS OIL AWAY IM SO SALTY RN FUCK
5492 2018-03-11 18:13:36 He's an oil man, look at his bio.
He doesn't understand/ care that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground for the sake of his kids and grandkids he claims he has has & cares about
Probably doesn't believe you can get sick from water contaminated by an oil pipeline leak, or that
5493 2018-03-11 18:13:10 Karatbars has more than just Gold....
They have a luxrious body oil that's made with 23k gold flakes.

5494 2018-03-11 18:13:01 You don't need to workout as long as you can stick your finger through medu wada without getting oil on it
5495 2018-03-11 18:12:57 nah its fish sauce, honey, garlic, and a little bit of peppers. they usually cook it in peanut oil but i have a friend who asks for it to be cooked in a differnt oil with no peanuts/
5496 2018-03-11 18:12:28 Waylaid by a post-Arizona spiritual flu. Been hopped up on oil of oregano and citrus fruit.
5497 2018-03-11 18:12:11 it's just oil, omg, it's inferior to whipped cream in every way
5498 2018-03-11 18:12:11 They ignite oil so it burns off instead of pooling while they prepare to cap the blowout. These are Kuwait fields set on fire by retreating Iraq soldiers 1991.
5499 2018-03-11 18:11:51 For a while, there was a low-calory American brand of potato chips which were fried in mineral oil. It didn't last, maybe because they were forced to include the warning "may cause rectal leakage".
5500 2018-03-11 18:11:48 Will it work with avacado oil?
5501 2018-03-11 18:11:39 Oh, I know. I’m just saying that now that the market is defined, we should all be selling snake oil to them. I have a magic onion that protects from radiation. Only $10,000.
5502 2018-03-11 18:11:27 i wanna try oil carts again but like??? that's more money and honestly I just prefer bud am i really that boring
5503 2018-03-11 18:11:17 From an engineering point of view, trains are a much more dangerous/unstable way to transport oil than pipelines. Many more variables. 
5504 2018-03-11 18:11:13 Argan oil
5505 2018-03-11 18:11:09 Oil industry saw to it we have no choice.  There were electric cars & charging stations in NYC in early 1900's. Gone. Since WW2, oil industry caused most products to be made & wrapped in plastic. Soft drinks were in refundable glass bottles, now 1 use & end up in whales.
5506 2018-03-11 18:11:07 sana may magbigay ng tea tree oil or tea tree facial wash saken hahahaha thanks chz
5507 2018-03-11 18:11:00 Lavender oil: the smell is proven to help with sleep. Lush has an amazing cream (it has sleep in the title) and it has lavender in it: should do the trick. Hope you have better luck sleeping dear!

5511 2018-03-11 18:10:38 Have you ever tried oil pulling? It’s super good for your teeth as far as cavities and stuff go. It pulls out toxins. Maybe it would help the dark spots?? I’ve also heard that it can whiten teeth as well! Coconut oil is supposed to be the best I think?

5517 2018-03-11 18:09:37 That should read:  the oil COATS the surface of your eye
5518 2018-03-11 18:09:37 Use Rose hip oil & vitamin e for that
5519 2018-03-11 18:09:16 @hsr Bus 0808 seems to have an emissions problem. Lots of smoke. Burning oil?
5520 2018-03-11 18:09:08 From Mukwano oil to Sunseed oil. Won't He do it!!
5521 2018-03-11 18:08:50 I think it is because YPG is acting as an US ally against Russia and Syria in Deir Zor/Raqqa. Russia wants  YPG to leave oil fields and Arab cities by forcing it to defend their Kurdish home towns. It is not realistic both serving US interests and expecting Russian protection
5522 2018-03-11 18:08:47 Gas and oil are the same resource. But I'm mean we humans need to progress. Make errors sure. But eventually make our world better.

5527 2018-03-11 18:07:46 Because he got shit value back when he traded away the entire 2nd line of the Islanders and NJ’s franchise player? Btw, claiming the Oil wouldn’t have picked Barzal is a hilarious self-own that doesn’t make that trade any better.
5528 2018-03-11 18:07:35 I must go out be yes, national unity, federalism, centralized army under Damascus leadership are *official* long term policy of SDF.
Need time to negociate safety.
And to negociate this, they keep land and oil, but when united military is back oil will obviously get back to Syria
5529 2018-03-11 18:07:30 So u got coconut oil up in you

5533 2018-03-11 18:06:46 @bigmayun sounds like a pharma post: ‘snake oil elixir promises to cure the world of cancer!’ Without reading the research behind it.
5534 2018-03-11 18:06:35 I can’t help it. You’ve turned me into an elitist. If it isn’t WoO, WoOLM, Lucas Oil, USAC or the All-Stars I pretty much have zero interest 
5535 2018-03-11 18:06:32 LOL.. Trump is not stopping any war. I don't defend what happened under Obama at Standing Rock.. but Trump is the one who gave it back to the oil industry. Not to mention Bears Ears. He's EXACTLY the same.if not worse.

5540 2018-03-11 18:06:13 Marge's goal today is to prove that Green Energy is not the answer & trump is brilliant for pushing coal & oil.

5545 2018-03-11 18:05:49 That's interesting - that photo looks more like a sampling of items made and transported with oil.
5546 2018-03-11 18:05:48 What ever dude! Those people literally brought oil to an “anti oil pipeline” rally! Zero credibility in my books! If there are all about using alternative energy sources (which I highly doubt) The rally is the perfect platform to display that! #Fail
5547 2018-03-11 18:05:17 Oil
5548 2018-03-11 18:05:13 You really like to repeat your unresearched, un backed up dismissal of the truth don’t you?  Let’s be honest.  You haven’t paid any attention until Trump and he’s such a snake oil salesman you believe his bombastic claims. The statistics are there, research when he makes a claim.

5560 2018-03-11 18:02:56 @PaulBegala I remember you outrage over the damage to your state by the BP oil spill. Speak up and speak out before it happens again. Silence is not acceptable!
5561 2018-03-11 18:02:49 And coconut oil.
5562 2018-03-11 18:02:46 Licking my fingers w oil paint on em oops
5563 2018-03-11 18:02:40 That’s still far less coal than we are currently burning. I’d rather we keep limited resources like coal and oil for producing plastics and metals, rather than burning them like there’s no tomorrow.
5564 2018-03-11 18:02:37 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

5573 2018-03-11 18:01:44 Yeah I tried this a recent while back but it didn’t work mostly cause sth like coconut oil is super great for my hair but destroys my skin kabisa. I tried with some really good butter but it never worked well :/

5577 2018-03-11 18:01:33 When you live in an oil based culture where many of the ONLY affordable options are oil based products, it’s misguided to say that someone’s opinion has zero credibility because they’re forced to use the only products available.
5578 2018-03-11 18:01:33 The Man Who Knew Too Little. It is interesting that no one wants a coal mine, oil well around them, or even power lines close by, but they all seem to have used the products to enhance their own lives.  Piss in someone else's back yard and not in theirs is the motto.

5586 2018-03-11 18:00:15 I understand that. But with hybrid cars for example used 3 different resources which was gas oil and electric when a regular car just used 2.
5587 2018-03-11 18:00:03 Iran: OPEC could agree in June to start easing oil output cuts in 2019 - WSJ: DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC could agree in June to begin easing current oil production curbs in 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
5588 2018-03-11 17:59:53 Don’t worry the USA and allies will rebuild at a cost. If you don’t have money just sign this oil contract. Don’t worry no more Isis.... we have them a safe corridor and shipped them to Syria to continue helping gaining contracts
5589 2018-03-11 17:59:47 I had a cold a month or so ago and never used it but I took it at the onset for a few days and I didn’t think it worked but my cold def went away fast. I also ingested 20 hot drinks with manuka too   OH and oil of oregano!!
5590 2018-03-11 17:59:44 I've been drivin my truck for 10,000 miles and haven't changed the oil is that a problem? @elonmusk

5593 2018-03-11 17:59:32 Not the same at all.  How many garment options does a person have to keep warm?  How many fuel and engine options are available?  Also, fur is much more expensive than cotton or other fabrics, whereas oil and gas are practically the cheapest options.
5594 2018-03-11 17:59:27 Fast forward to GWB.  He brought his dad's warhawks into his administration, men who were bitter over GHWB's refusal to go to Baghdad.  Propped up by oil money, they determined to "finish the job."  All they needed was an excuse that the American people would buy.  Hence, 9/11.

5596 2018-03-11 17:59:18 There’s something beautifully simple about this recipe. Reminds me of holidays in Greece with my great uncle’s family in a little house near the Corinth Canal. They had a lemon tree in the garden & grew most of their own veg. Olive oil from the local cooperative in a wine bottle.

5621 2018-03-11 17:56:16 You mean like they did with @BillClinton in the 90s, with #Bush and @BarackObama after that?
They surely enjoyed heating oil, stuff for the peasants and #nuclear technologies. So why not now? #DrainTheSwamp

5623 2018-03-11 17:55:44 What about all these folk? What about them? Largely, more opportunities for your mates to make some dosh, I'd say. Look at the PCSK9 "vaccines" (ha!) they're working on. And all the money made by scaring ApoE4 folk. And all the gut biome snake oil merchants. What about them?
5624 2018-03-11 17:55:41 McClure is responsible for discovering Ida Minerva Tarbell, investigative journalist whose dogged reporting broke up J.D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly.
5625 2018-03-11 17:55:14 Combine the fact that manufacturing is coming back plus the ANWR deal then we begin to understand why China and Russia stand behind the North Korea meeting. China must maintain double digit growth or go into deep recession and Russia depends on high oil prices. POTUS IS A GENIUS
5626 2018-03-11 17:55:07 Yes that would be us lol, how cool is that though  San Miguel is some good oil lol

5629 2018-03-11 17:54:28 Is that in the @TheOklahoman today? I might have to pick up that rag just to read the @OERBOK propaganda. Ya know because oil & gas industry good. Teachers & state employees are bad — according to the OERB and others.
5630 2018-03-11 17:54:20 lmaoooo  bro hell naw you don’t. Yo junk patchy lol you could use some oil

5633 2018-03-11 17:53:48 #America #Americans Roll back of Obama-era regulation in the Gulf and in the oil industry along with dysfunctional @EPA & Dir @EPAScottPruitt who is fiscally irresponsible are a danger to enviromental health of nation and #Americans
5634 2018-03-11 17:53:42 I think that looking how our governments now cosy up to dictators, despots and oligarchs as long as there is money involved, that our current tories would cosy with that Nazi's as long as they were buying our state assets and providing oil!
5635 2018-03-11 17:53:29 Changing the oil in these winds was a fucking terrible idea.
5636 2018-03-11 17:53:23 スプラッター映画はそう見ないですね……スプラッターしてるところ見るのが目的ではないので……
5637 2018-03-11 17:53:02 damn I’m sad I don’t have Oil lmfaoo
5638 2018-03-11 17:53:00 Word on the street there’s a team there that needs a player than can run sub  it’s been a couple CODs but I can attempt to oil off some rust and see what’s up
5639 2018-03-11 17:52:53 You could try using peppermint oil? Apparently they hate it! Or use some sort of live trap—I think there’s some you can make yourself!
5640 2018-03-11 17:52:39 Today has already been pretty productive!! Went and got an oil change on the alero, washed all the guest bedding, washing our bedding and we still have to sweep the basement and get it ready for Friday when we have company come stay!!

5642 2018-03-11 17:52:36 Stop wasting money on things like oil exploration in lake Chad basin and just maybe you FG guys won’t have to tax us to death!
5643 2018-03-11 17:52:26 No mayo just oil and vinegar 
5644 2018-03-11 17:52:21 You have a concept error.  The money for these 2 entities aren't coming from the same source.

The fossil fuel industry doesn't give a shit, we will be using fossil fuels in one form or another until they are gone.  Oil alone is in so much day to day shit it can't be stopped.
5645 2018-03-11 17:52:20 Coal mines employ 100% more people than the 2.8 billion dollar failures of renewable energy companies the last 9 years. We have more oil than we know what to do with. I’m for ALL energy sources. The free market will create alternative solutions when tech becomes available
5646 2018-03-11 17:52:01 Don't want to shock you... but maybe Hogg and Rubin are the same person. 
5647 2018-03-11 17:51:43 Damn that’s some next level shit honestly. I can see the olive oil on dem beans.
5648 2018-03-11 17:51:31 I am in favor. Until we have alternatives for oil and gas let’s transport  it safely
5649 2018-03-11 17:51:29 Whaaa? I thought 'libtard' was a slur that a #Republican slung against a #Libertarian, when they disagreed on topics like legal pot, interventionist wars for oil, political meddling by the church, & gay marriage. #TheMoreYouKnow

5654 2018-03-11 17:50:57 The recent episode on Grey's Anatomy had a 14 year old that was given the oil so she could eat instead of having a feeding tube put in.
5655 2018-03-11 17:50:50 Yep!  Trump’s energy policy is sure helping Putin.  $60 per barrel oil and our fracking industry doesn’t make the Russian economy hum!
5656 2018-03-11 17:50:47 Your parents are hypocrites. They oppose oil yet they likely traveled to the rally by car. They wore clothes that were made and transported by oil. They wrote on signs that were manufactured using oil. You're using the computer and on the internet that was used with oil. Hmm.
5657 2018-03-11 17:50:44 Those “ oil saturated sands “ as you call them ... is the second largest oil deposit... on. the. Planet....
5658 2018-03-11 17:50:40 In that case! My advice would be: 

Mix olive oil with a defanging product like Knot On My Watch or Knot Today

 Apply throughout hair, put on plastic cap, blow dry on medium (or sit under hooded drier) for 30mins 

Try to detangle by hand, strand by strand
5659 2018-03-11 17:50:17 Bush & Cheney stole 3 Trilliondollars in oil in their Iraq war.Trump wants some !
5660 2018-03-11 17:49:49 If you love me send me 30 for my oil change 
5661 2018-03-11 17:49:43 Yeah but I think it has to be handmade and smell like patchouli oil and is worn by someone telling you about their band.
5662 2018-03-11 17:49:41 reddit can be so nice sometimes. i'm researching CBD oil for fibroid pain and there are multiple posts like "my gf has very bad cramps, can anyone recommend CBD oil for her? thanks "
5663 2018-03-11 17:49:36 The aroma of efficascent oil
5664 2018-03-11 17:49:35 you frigging hypocrite how about all the oil tanker traffic on the east coast oh wait there's no American money in that protest is there
5665 2018-03-11 17:49:24 But you don't wanna use too much because coconut oil can also eat your hair
5666 2018-03-11 17:49:21 Take biotin. Also silica is good for hair. Castor oil and coconut oils are good for hair strength and thickness
5667 2018-03-11 17:49:00 My hair smells like weed and coconut oil 
5668 2018-03-11 17:48:43 Amazing athiest is back in the news and this time it's not for pouring hot oil on his nuts
5669 2018-03-11 17:48:38 Oil ISN'T sustainable; neither is coal. Coal mines employ a miniscule percentage of Americans, and the rest of the world is moving forward instead of 50 years backward. I want to leave a clean, livable planet for my son. Progress and education are GOOD THINGS for everyone!
5670 2018-03-11 17:48:12 I got d hair spray n d oil. I hope to get good results thou.
5671 2018-03-11 17:47:35 He already does. It's his WHOLE GIG. Make people scared of shit, then sell them the "solution." He's a snake oil salesman. That's it.
5672 2018-03-11 17:47:30 Trump allows coal mines to pollute streams, oil offshore exploration, etc etc too many bad harmful deregulations to mention
5673 2018-03-11 17:47:25 He tasted oil.
5674 2018-03-11 17:47:07 Vegetables are prepared in stews or salads.Ful,a dish of broad beans cooked in oil, is common, as are cassavas and sweet potatoes. Nomads in the north rely on dairy products and meat from camels.

5675 2018-03-11 17:46:55 Stick to something you understand, like oil. Leave Liverpool to people from round Liverpool, cheers
5676 2018-03-11 17:46:48 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5677 2018-03-11 17:46:47 that’s a chemical reaction, it basically burnt you skin. stop using it and put aloe vera, vaseline or coconut oil on your face to soothe it and get rid of the redness
5678 2018-03-11 17:46:21 But lobbies for solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewables aren’t nearly as well funded as oil, gas and coal. It’s not hard to figure out why there is so much pushback. It’s not about jobs, it’s about profits and deep pockets. :/
5679 2018-03-11 17:46:02 Water , hair pills , and castor oil.  
5680 2018-03-11 17:45:49 Put some Johnson & Johnson baby oil on them to ease the pain
5681 2018-03-11 17:45:42 Check your Engine oil this morning.
5682 2018-03-11 17:45:33 I had ordered an engine oil from amazon . They provided the wrong oil as the information on the website and their app was incorrect and misguiding only to be finally told that it is non retrunable product. ORDER # 407-5621670-7879563
5683 2018-03-11 17:45:27 Thanks! I cheated a bit - for the poached eggs lightly oil some cling film over a cup and drop the egg in then tie the top up, removing all the air and boil for 5-10mins (runny to hard). Need to cut the plastic open carefully as it gets very hot. Saw that on Masterchef Au 
5684 2018-03-11 17:45:23 sekarang kena guna everything!! oil cleanser, cleanser, scrub, moisturizer, masks, oil etc. but it takes forever to clear up my skin lol
5685 2018-03-11 17:44:46 Starlight Traveler yeah they were on Spotify but can I wonder if you go rip to get castor oil for the rush!

5687 2018-03-11 17:44:12 I mix coconut oil with my dog's kibble and he just ends up licking the coconut off the food and not eating.
5688 2018-03-11 17:44:03 M soo miffed I could not buy any products last month that oil and the lemon brightening serum are the best for my skin
5689 2018-03-11 17:44:03 Female swear they slicker then baby oil .

5691 2018-03-11 17:43:51 maple syrup? It's like olive oil of how you sometimes get so used to the fake stuff that you don't recognize the real deal. Speaking of fake stuff... "You also need to start cleaning your tits better. Or did the doctors say you can't get water on them for a couple weeks?"-

5697 2018-03-11 17:42:30 okay bet. I wash my face with raw african black soap and use dr bronners hemp rose soap and dilute it with water. then I occasionally use acv (also diluted with water) to tone my face. then I use jojoba oil, rosehip oil, and kate blanc vitamin c serum.
5698 2018-03-11 17:42:24 @DesiPerkins I had a dream you and I were hanging out talking about your best glow products video and you were telling me I NEED the nars body oil and we were fangirling over @iluvsarahii together lmao

5701 2018-03-11 17:42:05 Supposedly the first hydrogen powered vehicle was developed in the 70s and promptly shut down by Big Oil and the Big 3. It is all about money and power. Change will come at a cost and the people who will pay the most want it the least because they will be paying the most.
5702 2018-03-11 17:41:57 In a state with oil billionaires....
5703 2018-03-11 17:41:47 Well.....coal mines are opening back up, USA will the world leader in oil production in a few years and manufacturing jobs are coming back.

5707 2018-03-11 17:41:02 I'd been under the impression that the could not survive at the low price of oil today.

5709 2018-03-11 17:40:50 Umm...I do not think Tillerson is in the loop of immediate news. He is just waiting to fulfill the Russian promise after Trump, Pence and Ryan...right? I mean, this is still about the oil and diamonds, not healthcare and cars.
5710 2018-03-11 17:40:20 Any economic improvement is due to oil and despite Putin and his cronys. Putin enriches himself at the expense of Russia and its people. It's hard to imagine a worse leader if you're interested in the welfare of the people.

5718 2018-03-11 17:39:34 Unfortunately countries need substantial manufacturing and oil industries to be a world power. Even in this high tech world because the basics will still need steel, aluminum and oil to build. Approximately 1100 products come from oil, including plastic.

“Your car had no oil in the engine.”

“I did. I moved it to the trunk.”

5760 2018-03-11 17:32:42 Please go fight another issue - Why does local Sasol who produces petrol from coal mined in South Africa charge the citizens of this country International oil prices? What does it cost them per litre. We shouldn't tolerate this abuse & thieving
5761 2018-03-11 17:32:37 Nice. So When Putin is getting oil from Asad, no wonder he his backing Asad's regime. Not smart on his part. I guess we will continue to return fire on his mercenaries that are nothing more than Russian soldiers in civilian clothes.

5763 2018-03-11 17:32:34 Definitely it is the time for America to be educated informed taught on the arithmetic of how trade and our economy work! It was time in 2015 when Trump announced he would tank trade agreements to make white workers think coal, steel, offshore oil was going to make a Big Comeback
5764 2018-03-11 17:31:52 (1/2) Visited a friend in the hospital unable to ingest food, and noticed his IV bag contained dextrose. Researching further, standard TPN (total nutrition) solution is mostly sugar and soybean oil and gives people NAFLD over the long term.

5766 2018-03-11 17:31:23 I’m a diehard Oiler fan but McDavid shouldn’t be in on the Hart vote. If the Hart was for the most valuable player in the league than yes I think he would be nominated & probably win but that is what the art ross is typically for. If oil were playoff bound he would win for sure.

5769 2018-03-11 17:31:10 Vancouver has a problem and yes it needs to be delt with. But oil in a pipeline does not create smog.
Vancouver should have higher carbon taxes than the rest of BC. Should be law that if you live in Vancouver you must drive an EV if you own a vehicle as well.

5786 2018-03-11 17:28:12 With warm baby oil ok! Put it in the microwave real quick shit was hot poured it all over my body we was young and horny
5787 2018-03-11 17:27:59 The art of revolutionary politics is to keep the balance in all circumstances and to know how to go forward. The oil price is stable, and the Petro has hit hard. In the pre-sale of the Petro we already have 5 billion dollars, we are on course to prosperity.
5788 2018-03-11 17:27:59 Applied a mixture of tea tree and coconut oil to my face last night in a scientific experiment to see if it would help my acne scars fade over time with continual use and I honeslty see a difference already.

5805 2018-03-11 17:25:20 I did some work for a Japanese car co in the 90s. They had a hydrogen fuel cell that could run off water & were looking at how to market it. They spiked it under pressure from US interests: oil, gov & Detroit.
It's now 2018.

Hope you are keeping well.
May I recommend papaya oil/moringa oil/toulouccouna oil

I find scented face mask a bit strong as most clay masks are self heating.
Our new range of masks will soon be available and I have 1 in mind for you  x
5823 2018-03-11 17:22:10 High prices and some demand, sure, but there is not enough demand to make up what we are losing out on not getting our oil to world markets. And we’d still need a pipeline to get the added product there, whether refined in AB or BC.
5824 2018-03-11 17:21:53 “The state humiliates toll violators by listing their names and amounts owed on a website. Some owe as much as $153,000” (Texas the state that brings in the most amount of money from oil, but never would think to use that $ for infrastructure..)
5825 2018-03-11 17:21:50 Your idea of giving socialism a try is a reflection of your lack of history knowledge. I’m so sorry that you believed El Che and Castro and Chavez. Please ask Venezuelans in the richest oil in the world how they are doing w 21st century socialism ?
5826 2018-03-11 17:21:47 Americans: "Let's spend a few $ trillion on a war for oil, that's cool."

5833 2018-03-11 17:20:58 How does it feel to be a pawn in a game, so that the US gets unfettered access to Canadian oil at a 50% discount, so they can sell it back to you at maximum profits? Do you feel used? Violated? Naive?
5834 2018-03-11 17:20:54 But what about all that gop money in oil and coal??
5835 2018-03-11 17:20:50 Or we could build new small modular and molten salt nuclear reactors.

Cut air pollution, lower our CO2 output, end energy poverty, and kneecap oil dictatorships. Sounds fun!
5836 2018-03-11 17:20:43 What ? Like we have for New Zealand lamb, Australian wine, South African fruit, South Korean electronics, US computers, Middle East oil ? The list goes on and on.....Where are the hold ups and queues ?
5837 2018-03-11 17:20:31 Just as bad as the Alberta conservatives, but there’s no oil flowing here to cover up their bullshit.

5839 2018-03-11 17:20:04 Wow! So perceptive! This proves what? That i am right. Not self righteous! Pollution is climbing and waiting too long will be too late. I want more choices not an oil monopoly over every aspect of my life. History will judge those who were slow and lazy. Or history will end.
5840 2018-03-11 17:19:53 Honestly try it. They are so delicious. I’d recommend boiling your potatoes for 5 mins and then putting them in a bowl and adding a tablespoon of oil and a tablespoon of marmite. It makes it much easier to coat the potatoes. Then bake in the oven on baking paper 
5841 2018-03-11 17:19:52 This poor kid can barely spell and has no knowledge of history, political philosophy or how our government is structured, but he sure has a firm grip on all the latest Commie/Lib/DemonRat platitudes.
5842 2018-03-11 17:19:49 I can throw my parts in the dishwasher and it does the trick. The only other thing I do is wipe it in case anything leaks but since it’s no oil so usually don’t have much to clean
5843 2018-03-11 17:19:35 Not really. Oil companies that have branched out into fracking natural gas LOVE renewables like solar and wind because their product is the backup when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.
5844 2018-03-11 17:19:21 The way left does it is impractical, inorganic, and disastrous. Dont cut off the oil tap, have a gentle transition while the oil is there. Otherwise u have high energy costs, like in Europe and stalled industry. Ever try to cut off welfare like this? Isnt it a similar principle?
5845 2018-03-11 17:19:18 It's all about Temporary power for the individual slum Lord!  Always has been!  They care nothing about the future or the nation that feeds their selfish greed!

5846 2018-03-11 17:19:09 The idea that protesting oil pipelines has to mean that you can’t buy or use oil products is misguided. People are protesting the fact that governments refuse to diversify and supply consumers with affordable energy choices. We currently live in an inescapable oil based culture.

5850 2018-03-11 17:18:34 There's so much fear mongering involved that it's difficult to have good, solid dialog with people. Plus who would we go to war with if we didn't have oil to fight over?
5851 2018-03-11 17:18:29 big potential for #GSHPs in Norway - to catch up with Sweden. (Norwegians had way too much oil compared to Sweden!).
5852 2018-03-11 17:18:19 Sure thing. FYI, we've been fighting Dominion, pipelines, coal-fired power plants, fracking, offshore oil drilling, etc. etc, for many years (e.g., since 2005, ,going back to the Raising Kaine days), not just "recently."

5895 2018-03-11 17:12:19 No history. No youth policy. Oil money. Owners gonna run away. Pep won’t stay. Dele, dier play a couple of games, England cap. Toxin, Foden zip.
5896 2018-03-11 17:12:16 Vitamin C oil, y’all.

If you aren’t using one you need to seriously consider looking into it!
5897 2018-03-11 17:12:16 And Russia, Saudi Arabia and a dozen more economies for whom oil is their lifeblood.
5898 2018-03-11 17:12:12 A bit of olive oil

5900 2018-03-11 17:11:57 Mr Pompey first Trump begged for a meeting this is not a negotiation. Second Kim holds the cards on how the meeting will happen. Third Trump’s Trade War on China may be met with them providing food oil etc to North Korea in retaliation and threaten to protect North Korea
5901 2018-03-11 17:11:52 I’m on my second bottle of Sunday Riley ufo oil (after being without it for like a month) & it’s safe to say that is my skins savior. It always takes care of my acne so quick. I love it so much

5904 2018-03-11 17:11:30 i was looking for sesame oil too bih! the closest asian market is like hours away lmfaoooo, but i'll deff try that
5905 2018-03-11 17:11:29 They don't have to do it NOW. I know you're thick as fuck but try to understand you're not their boss.  Also, it might have something to do with appointments like DeVos, who knows fuck-all about education and Zinke, who is more interested in oil.
Suck it, bonespurs.
5906 2018-03-11 17:11:16 We are already making huge carbon reduction progress.  An (almost) all electric economy is within a twenty year touching distance but it needs legislation to make it happen.  Only planes and ships should need oil now.
5907 2018-03-11 17:11:11 @iam_Davido does your nose smell like hot oil
5908 2018-03-11 17:11:08 I use full synthetic for my GTI but I’ve never been able to go that long  without an oil change, then again I drive a lot more than the average person lol
5909 2018-03-11 17:10:59 Obama signed enough oil pipeline permits to more than circle the equator! Obama approved drilling in the Arctic, environmentally the most dangerous spot on earth to drill. He only talked green! Oil production grew 88% under obama.
5910 2018-03-11 17:10:55 I use it only at night. I put it on first (after double cleansing) and then put a vitamin c serum on top, then moisturizer, and finally maracuja or argan oil.
5911 2018-03-11 17:10:46 It will be seen that way in many oil and gas producing nations until food shortages from unpredictable season cycles cause hunger crises. Then, suddenly, EVERYONE will be scrambling.
5912 2018-03-11 17:10:44 because you have moved from gas to electric you have to adjust your cooking time...add in extra oil and update to nonstick pan as well
5913 2018-03-11 17:10:39 Do you realize how much @FranksRedHot is used in Buffalo? Apparently, your marketing team doesn't know chicken wings (not Buffalo wings)&blue cheese go together like oil n vinegar! Maybe you should send them here to do some research!#Ridiculousness
5914 2018-03-11 17:10:28 Do you realize what that Iran deal did & how it trapped our enemy’s income and made them all compete over oil. Hurt Russia in a big way. Seriously, if you don’t look at the long term plan, research. When did the price of gasoline go down?  Happy to have a calm discussion. Best2u
5915 2018-03-11 17:10:25 Be sure to check the oil.
5916 2018-03-11 17:10:23 You would never get a visa to poke around Cabinda province. . Only us oil sluts get visas, as you are aware of the tribal/oil money/justice issues. I never felt unsafe, but the white guys weren’t hassled by govt. It is very beautiful but I don’t miss it!.

5920 2018-03-11 17:10:07 Savages??? They have sacrificed thousands of their young men and women in the fight against Isis. It was Turkey who was arming Isis (arrested editor of Turkish newspaper for reporting it) and funding it by buying oil from it on the cheap.
5921 2018-03-11 17:09:52 Made chicken teriyaki without sesame oil and seeds because I can 
5922 2018-03-11 17:09:19 Maybe it’s the cap then the material on ur edges try to find a silk cap & get some Jamaican castor oil
5923 2018-03-11 17:09:17 OMG sis u gotta make fried rice w that. dump cooked rice and kimchi into a pan w some sesame oil and fry that shit!!!
5924 2018-03-11 17:09:12 That’s the truth! Hollywood and the WH threw him out. He’ll keep pushing the snake oil as long as someone is buying it.
5925 2018-03-11 17:09:07 I’d call this place “The Scrub Zone” because those poor trees do nothing but scrub the CO2 with which oil companies like yours have saturated our atmosphere.

Have a nice day
5926 2018-03-11 17:08:45 He has a good point. Everyone protesting oil pipelines didn't get to that protest by walking. They didn't write their twitter rants on a piece of paper. And the clothing they wear likely came from as many petroleum products as natural fibers.
5927 2018-03-11 17:08:41 หวานขนาดนี้ ไม่ดีแน่ๆๆๆ
5928 2018-03-11 17:08:06 I need to get some beard wash and beard oil ASAP!
5929 2018-03-11 17:07:57 We had blunts, joints, bongs, dab rigs, and oil pens in rotation at the crib last night. Niggas were high AF.
5930 2018-03-11 17:07:55 Well For the oil and the filter it’s around 18 but I’ll be damned if I pay somebody to do it. It’s so easy.
5931 2018-03-11 17:07:38 They are doing so already and will continue to do so by employing scientists, technogists, manufacturers, material suppliers and regulators who have significantly reduce pollution for the production and burning of oil products.
5932 2018-03-11 17:07:30 With politics not all animals are equal, u choose yo audience carefully u cannot be talking of macroeconomics in a deep rural area. The reason why ZANU Pf go ther with a 750ml of cooking oil and a packet of sugar and claim popularity
5933 2018-03-11 17:07:25 I knew the Fox show, "America's Heartland" was inaccurate when it said we have a growing dependence on foreign oil.  But then it projected ethanol growth in the coming years, with a major share of the market "by 2012."  Hmmm.
5934 2018-03-11 17:07:07 Why's Nigeria building Rail line to Niger and Chad and why an oil refinery at a Border town up North
5935 2018-03-11 17:06:45 My dumbass was trying to catch a hash brown and dropped my entire hand in the burning oil.
5936 2018-03-11 17:06:01 1 ounce of flaxseed oil contains nearly 15,000mg of heart healthy omega 3 fatty acids.
5937 2018-03-11 17:05:53 I think they're Iraqis setting the oil fields on fire. Fire fighters would usually use high explosives to put the fire out.
5938 2018-03-11 17:05:53 Sementara ada harga yg okay, beli dulu. HA, Lactic, Argan oil, Caffeine, Niacinamide, Vit C, AHA + BHA, Glycolic Acid antara yang quite okay juga harga dia kat Hermo. Lain, mmg mahal. Haha. MASALAHNYA NIACINAMIDE DAH OOS APA KES, NYAH?
5939 2018-03-11 17:05:47 The pundits are lying if they say somewhat. It's really low... and you are the liar. Gosh I've never believed such an evil snake oil salesmen would become president. SAD!

5941 2018-03-11 17:05:30 Pipelines provide safe reliable environmentally effective means of transporting large bulk liquids such as water, sewage, oil gas and refined products. We have millions of miles in place in North A.The eco-terrorists are about killing a Canadian industry in favour of theirs.
5942 2018-03-11 17:05:28 Omega 3’s found in fish oil (DHA &amp; EPA) can help reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, improve
cognitive function, shunt breast cancer development, relieve depression, and increase muscle protein
synthesis.
5943 2018-03-11 17:05:24 “Big tent” is the phrase corporate Democrats use so they sound inclusive instead of like sellouts. The tent’s not big enough to include hawkishness, coziness with Wall Street, or handjobs for the oil industry, big pharma, health insurance, military industrial complex, etc.

5948 2018-03-11 17:04:23 A mechanic missing a front tooth & smoking a cigarette next to my gas tank is lecturing me about how unsafe it was to drive 500 miles over my oil change due date
5949 2018-03-11 17:03:55 It’s really a traveling “snake-oil salesman” show.  But he’s not selling oil, he’s selling your souls.
5950 2018-03-11 17:03:37 I need make appointment to get a hot oil treatment
5951 2018-03-11 17:03:27 life can't be viewed from one angle alone.
5952 2018-03-11 17:03:26 this isn’t for sure i but i think doges can have small doses of CBD oil and stuff to help with that kind of thing!! check with your vet!
5953 2018-03-11 17:03:22 And the  MSM in UK has no mention of Erdogans threats against Cyprus or the Italian ship attempting exploratory drilling for oil in Cypriot territorial waters! Two EU member states threatened by Turkish warships and the silence is deafening
5954 2018-03-11 17:03:11 In my lifetime, they have delivered Thatcher, Iraq War, PFI, lied to the Scottish nation re oil, tuition fees, Scottish Labour have supported Tories denying their party power, cheered the election of UKIP MEP, and are now enabling  xenophobic Brexit. Not a great record.

5957 2018-03-11 17:02:47 You can add peppermint oil when you take a warm relaxing bath, or 3/5 drops to rub on the temples as needed and as usual, every other day, drops in the vaporizer of the radiator or burning incense.

5960 2018-03-11 17:02:29 The question is, why are they shitholes, at this point in modern history?  Especially when Africa holds some of the richest and most sought after resources. It’s slavery on a mass scale. It doesn’t need to be that way.

5965 2018-03-11 17:01:50 I'm 100% sure this oil change is gonna end in "we need to fix ALL these things or you'll die" bc 1) that happens 99% of the time and 2) he asked me what kind of oil I'd been using and I said "the regular kind?" w very audible questions marks

5976 2018-03-11 17:00:17 Marula oil is marula oil but the key difference in DE and other brands is the way they process their oil. Theirs is more nutrient dense, last longer, and more stable. Lasting 3 years opposed to The Oridinary’s 1 year.

6016 2018-03-11 16:54:19 Or support the science of it so it can be created? Which it would have been brilliant if oil/gas had done cause they could have profited off that. But no, the greedy, short sighted bastards  didn't. Also, Electric cars exist so...
6017 2018-03-11 16:54:09 Zvogobatsirei if we are importing raw materials. In Mutare Cairns is import raw beans from Malawi for their baked beans and the same is happening to cooking oil industry.

We want production supported by a value chain.

6030 2018-03-11 16:51:33 In my area nothing is legal, legislators are still trying to make CBD oil legal in state (really backwards) So, if you have a dealer here they may have many other products that they would entice you with. Madison, Indiana is a perfect example.

6039 2018-03-11 16:50:26 Do you use oil or butter?
6040 2018-03-11 16:50:21 Thanks sisssssssss. Btw betul ke i have to avoid oil and cream and use mainly water-based?
6041 2018-03-11 16:50:09 they said they were waiting for an event
that would justify occupying Iraq and taking the oil.
6042 2018-03-11 16:50:04 While farmers struggle with declining farm income & a poor ag economy, most oil refiners are experiencing a boom. The #RFSworks for agriculture & our entire nation. Growth has slowed in the face of past gov't policies & oil industry opposition. We need your support @POTUS
6043 2018-03-11 16:49:58 That moment you realise you can use your own shit as a fuel resource. But the secret handshake gang keep the oil flowing.

6054 2018-03-11 16:49:23 (2/2) The oil industry itself was predicting an oil boom hence its investment in North Sea was a record high. UK Gov also boasted about an oil boom in a press release in 2014. Scot Gov was providing info about an independent Scotland -  that was its duty and Britnats wanted more.

6057 2018-03-11 16:49:12 Yes but Hollywood doesn't NEED to fly private planes and sail in huge gas guzzling yaughts. Instead of preaching perhaps you people can make some reasonable changes in your own lives which leave a bigger carbon footprint than regular people who actually work in the oil field.

Do you have evidence that Alex Salmond got the late Gordon Wilson "to take the fall for his claims about oil", or was that just an honest mistake that you made as well?

You might want to reflect on the definition of 'honest'.

6074 2018-03-11 16:47:13 You people need to get a grip.  When you lose cheap steel from China, you increase our productivity and out OWN steel industry increases.  It is the same with oil.  We have oil in Texas and Alaska.  We don't need foreign oil.  Enough oil in Texas for next 100 years for all.

6087 2018-03-11 16:45:25 It’s really the oil and gas companies that are going to see an immediate difference. They use by far the most pipe and steel. It could increase the cost of gas temporarily. It will also increase dividends

6111 2018-03-11 16:43:00 No really, nuclear energy is totally safe. Oil drilling is also good for the environment. The media just doesn't cover the long term effects of the solar panel meltdowns that contaminate the land for 100s of years or the wind spills that pollute our water supplies...

6127 2018-03-11 16:41:23 the response to this chart will be to ramp up the near-condensate light oil production as fast as possible and then look surprised at shareholder meetings when describing the "unforeseeable" disconnect between WTI and ultralight Permian production.

6132 2018-03-11 16:40:19 Human societies existed long before fossil fuels were discovered. And if it turned out that Earth didn't have any fossil fuels, then I think we would have adapted. No clean land, water or air = no food = no society, either. Why is it oil or nothing?
6133 2018-03-11 16:40:19 Let's put this into context. After we caught Saddam, Qaddafi gave up nuke program w/o a shoot fired. He helped us with rendition & was working on his chem/bio program when the Arab Spring hit. obama didn't like GW methods on Iraq & was talking into a war by France for cheaper oil
6134 2018-03-11 16:40:16 I couldn’t agree more with this rationale. No more Oil, Gasoline, Natural Gas, Plastics or any machinery made products for them. Good luck with that.

6148 2018-03-11 16:37:53 Pres. Akufo-Addo "has pledged to heed that advice, and to funnel oil revenues into education, agriculture and manufacturing, to diversify the economy." 

A pledge is nothing more than lip service until acted upon, but at least he's singing the right tune.

6152 2018-03-11 16:37:23 Change, for this particular issue, doesn’t happen at the market level. People can’t just stop using gasoline to make it clear that they want cars that don’t depend on oil. And oil and car companies all know it.

6168 2018-03-11 16:35:40 Pour your mothers anointing oil all over your face,stand in the sun ,take a picture with a filter and come and lie that your skin is glowing
6169 2018-03-11 16:35:39 mentiroso
6170 2018-03-11 16:35:24 A decent part of it is bc of the oil & gas industry. Over last 10 yrs they've brought in guys from Arkansas, Oklahoma, etc. for long term jobs... many of them bring their families & are drawn 2 rural areas that are similar to home.  All of a sudden, boom. Pennsyltucky. 
6171 2018-03-11 16:35:22 Kle mangolia oil how many bottles am i meant to use for it to also change my life? #GirlTalkZA
6172 2018-03-11 16:35:17 yeah, i usually go straight for the rice cooker if it's up to me, but my mom likes to make it on the stove so she fries it just a little beforehand. (and we use vegetable oil instead of coconut so it's not EXACTLY the same).

we do wash it as well. otherwise bugs get in.

6176 2018-03-11 16:34:52 Yes they do and people remember the spill that spewed oil all over a residential area in Burnaby?
6177 2018-03-11 16:34:39 I need an oil change anyone one knows of a place open today ?

6184 2018-03-11 16:33:31 In the past, olive oil was stored on the beach and loaded into the gondola harbor  farm.
6185 2018-03-11 16:33:31 So you have devised a clean power system to get goods carried by Train, Plane, Truck, or van? Face it we will never go clean energy as long as oil companies hold politicians in their pockets.

6187 2018-03-11 16:33:19 And no one will be flying into Vancouver once there is an oil spill and an Environmental Disaster, so the air pollution should lessen a lot
6188 2018-03-11 16:33:17 Obviously this is destabilizing the worldwide oil market
6189 2018-03-11 16:33:17 Hit the ground running.we need the govt to do something that will bring the prices down.for heavens sake we are exploring oil goddammit.
6190 2018-03-11 16:33:15 People like this piss me the fuck off. It's not the general population's fault that we're forced to use an energy source we hate, because the powers-that-be gut research everywhere else, and make sure their friends in the oil industry profit.

6201 2018-03-11 16:31:54 Wrong.  With apologies.  Cleaner power systems are out there, under lock and patent.  Until the oil is used up, those systems will remain inaccessible, which is awful.
6202 2018-03-11 16:31:54 Trouble is, the supposed foreign buyers seem to like US Mars and Green Canyon quite a lot and Light Tight #Oil not so much.

6210 2018-03-11 16:30:40 Eric Prince's meeting with Russia, UAE & China. Billions in Nuclear reactors, Private army for stealing oil from UAE neighbors. Trump gutting the State Department, pulling Ambassadors out & allowing China, Russia & the UAE to fill the void. We are already destroying democracy.
6211 2018-03-11 16:30:39 Jb profits from oil pipelines that oppress our nations first people and destroy our planet. He has spent more in this primary than dodnald trump did during the entire presidential primary countrywide. You should be ashamed to support such a corrupt and horrible person

6213 2018-03-11 16:30:09 Why is oil a non-sequitur?
6214 2018-03-11 16:30:03 Cook it twice! Use it to make cheese grits, then cool leftovers, cut into cubes, toss with spices and a bit of oil, and bake cheesy grit bites

6220 2018-03-11 16:29:40 the small players in oil market where bought out during this over supply, big companies in full control
6221 2018-03-11 16:29:21 Hey Seth... when you have a goldmine underneath your you USE it.  Nothing says we can’t strive towards green energy while becoming largest exporter of oil.  It brings in money from a natural resource because guess what... lot of the world is not going to be renewable energy.
6222 2018-03-11 16:29:05 Funny how the chel is complaining about goalie interference now while the oil have been complaining since last years playoffs
6223 2018-03-11 16:29:00 @MirandaKerr @KORAORGANICS can you please make a sunscreen for oil that doesn't make my face feel disgusting  can't seem to find one and your products are the best
6224 2018-03-11 16:28:57 And how did Isis get the oil? Assad the president of Syria who claims he's fighting Isis
6225 2018-03-11 16:28:50 Now putin and his friends are the richest people in Russia and the people have seen little benefit from the oil boom. Corruption at work.
6226 2018-03-11 16:28:37 Bring some oil guys
6227 2018-03-11 16:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
6228 2018-03-11 16:28:28 Slicker than oil while you ashy
6229 2018-03-11 16:28:19 Firstly, it’s mostly Wall Street. They speculate on oil futures and that speculation drives prices. Also, oil companies do it - just because they can. We drive big honkin’ trucks and SUVs and complain about prices. We’re junkies...and we’re complaining to the pusher.
6230 2018-03-11 16:28:08 I was actually coming back to this tweet to recommend coconut oil  maybe change your shampoo and conditioner and buy some hair masks?
6231 2018-03-11 16:28:06 buy a new car they said, it’ll be fun they said. until my oil change is damn near $50 because I have full synthetic oil
6232 2018-03-11 16:28:01 gas prices use to be tied to oil, but that has been broke with over supply last couple years
6233 2018-03-11 16:27:18 We use mint oil mixed w/o coconut oil on feet & chest. Same principal, it seems.
6234 2018-03-11 16:27:18 If I already have virgin coconut oil in bulk, is the flavor going to transfer significantly that I should also get refined?
6235 2018-03-11 16:26:52 Is manhood where I actively seek out beard oil?
6236 2018-03-11 16:26:29 I love it when arguments are "really, really dumb idea". Very intelligent. Start with the basic problem at hand. Produce an alternative that is affordable to the normal people, instead of products that are ~50% more expensive. Most people will stick with oil based products.
6237 2018-03-11 16:26:29 Why did I think oil diffuser was a car part

6240 2018-03-11 16:25:58 Depends. But the persistent ones are like motor oil. They evaporate very slowly.

6252 2018-03-11 16:23:55 Starting a war half way across the world to secure oil is not protecting the US. The US military are being used as an arm of corporations who are lining their pockets with foreign oil money. You think there won't be a backlash if you invade another country?

6260 2018-03-11 16:22:58 Not wanting more pipelines to get oil to market isn't abt preferring oil produced unethically or not wanting plastic or clothes. It's abt not wanting to worsen #ClimateChange & release pollution. Keeping more Saudi oil in ground is a good idea too & let's move to #sustainability.
6261 2018-03-11 16:22:53 The Scots have a parliament which tries to stand up...
Making sure the door of social mobility is open & that the old are respected... even when drowning in oil and the dead wait of english austerity

Wales has a half arsed #WelshLabour council.
SENEDD NEEDS OUR EURO POWERS BACK
6262 2018-03-11 16:22:38 But if he wants a realistic answer... redefine the electric grid to phase out oil and coal, retool the homes for electric heating, add in solar panels to reinforce the grid's power usage, and bring all homes into the 21st century where they belong.
6263 2018-03-11 16:22:29 I guess the thrust of my question is whether this explosion of tight oil in those apis was a problem in the short term due to refining mismatch that fades in mt when refineries adapts, or whether it was a lt problem due to what you get out of the crack in terms of useful products

6266 2018-03-11 16:22:08 Takes a lot of oil to heat all those mansions in the northeast.

6269 2018-03-11 16:21:46 Our church drummer, Brandon? That’s where the oil is. The singing is cute, but he controls the groove (and/or atmosphere for my saved folks).
6270 2018-03-11 16:21:41 You can make a lame joke about a typo, but it still takes a lot of oil to heat all those mansions in the northeast.
6271 2018-03-11 16:21:35 When anxiety strikes outta nowhere id distract myself doing anything to avoid overthinking. So today i did black out poetry, reading, painting (acrylics, oil pastel, water colour) and sketching for so manyyyyy pages. My mind is exploded, crushingly so.
6272 2018-03-11 16:21:31 Not much logically points to that assumption. Trump is hitting the Russians in their pockets with his oil and steel policies and arming Ukraine with weapons including missiles doesn’t suggest anything to hide.

6278 2018-03-11 16:21:07 Man like you is on the water and biscuits then? Virtue signalling snake oil salesman
6279 2018-03-11 16:21:01 So basically you can’t find anything in the interview that is incorrect or that you disagree with but? Therefore he is a snake oil salesman. Makes sense.
6280 2018-03-11 16:21:00 Well, there’s quite a lot of evidence that Turkey bought oil from ISIS. Financing terrorism etc

6288 2018-03-11 16:19:27 Why not apply import taxes on all American products! Also reduce oil exports to the U.S.! 
If #Trump wants to play silly trade war games, he will lose in the end. He’s travelling down a very slippery path. #Tariffs
6289 2018-03-11 16:19:27 I've started wrapping Denso Tape on fertilizer equipment fittings as well.  It's for direct burial corrosion protection on pipelines.  Guys in the oil patch say it keeps saline ground from seizing flange bolts, so I figure I'll try it.

6298 2018-03-11 16:17:53 How many times have we heard the oil companies tell us they have to drill deeper and further off shore to find new reserves.  That alone should be a red flag that it's going to run out eventually.  Time to invest in renewable energy now, not when it's too late.

6302 2018-03-11 16:17:24 How does shipping oil via train or truck safer then a pipeline. Because that's what's going to happen if the Kinder Morgan pipeline is successfully stopped. #KinderMorgan

6312 2018-03-11 16:16:24 Mmmm. Looking good. Get out the oil and balsamic.
6313 2018-03-11 16:16:23 Water plant was supposed to have a scheduled maintenance check; ended up having a burst pipe that looked like an oil well overflow and crippled water supply...
6314 2018-03-11 16:16:12 Lmao girls weave there stinks like palm oil and desperation
6315 2018-03-11 16:16:07 I remember putting palm oil inside the rice the first time I tried cooking jollof rice. I thought that was what was responsible for the red colour.

6319 2018-03-11 16:15:48 The cloth is unwound into a machine with a printing press. It's an oil by-product that helps bind everything together.
6320 2018-03-11 16:15:42 I'm going to have an art exhibit and it'll be nothing but oil and acrylic paintings of dicks.
6321 2018-03-11 16:15:41 Bam bam for comot the onion wey dey burn for the oil before she pure the peeper naa...#BBNaija 
6322 2018-03-11 16:15:34 Why do you keep using oil, and all the products and services that it enables, if you are so against it?  Perhaps not using any petroleum-enabled products would carry a more profound message than taking a nap on a railroad track?
6323 2018-03-11 16:15:28 Sprayed the aubergines for the moussaka with olive oil and put them in the oven instead of frying them, because I'm a rebel.
6324 2018-03-11 16:15:24 petrodollar deal was: US secures SA oil supply, SA takes dollar revenues and invests them im USTs and US helps SA build up country, protect saud family etc.
6325 2018-03-11 16:15:05 Damn is that gravy I'm seeing in that pot with that oil oozing on top? Damn this kids will die young #BBNaija
6326 2018-03-11 16:14:37 yup. most common oil leaks on the 642 V6 is oil cooler, and occasionally a rear main, neither need the engine too come out, just a pain
6327 2018-03-11 16:14:37 I gotta go get an oil change tho
6328 2018-03-11 16:14:31 I'd be wary too but they weaned down to 0.25mg of Xanax, took CBD oil one night & forgot the Xanax. Now benzo free & without wd symptoms.

6338 2018-03-11 16:13:22 When I was younger, I was playin outside & was like “I’m thirsty”. So I went inside & drank olive oil bc I deadass thought it was apple juice.
6339 2018-03-11 16:13:18 vitamin E oil helped me alot and don’t forget to use sunscreen because the sun only makes the spots worse.
6340 2018-03-11 16:13:07 The concerns expressed in these discussions are:
1. Availability of heavy oil may become a problem/higher cost with "explosive" growth of tight oil forecast by IEA/EIA.
2. Poor quality of tight oil--can't make diesel & it makes lousy gasoline. What will we do with so much more?
6341 2018-03-11 16:12:54 鯖さん…(さまよう両手
6342 2018-03-11 16:12:35 Yep, and the fields that grow flowers could be used to farm crops.  The fields that grow palm oil to support the junk food industry could be used for a different purpose.  This is why it's not a hot topic particularly because the problem is bigger than farmed livestock.
6343 2018-03-11 16:12:29 A car oil kink
6344 2018-03-11 16:12:17 It's also, in relative terms, irrelevant compared to where our heavy crude oil will go (only suitable refinery is in Rotterdam).
6345 2018-03-11 16:12:10 Aku pernah beli mba, dicoba dibibir (dengan bodohnya) trus mulut ga bisa dibuka. Lengket parah sampe akhirnya dihapus pake baby oil dan olive oil gantian berkali2

6347 2018-03-11 16:11:54 I want something that doesn't take long in the morning. Something quick and easy. How should I have it? Need help. Will blow it out. Use sum coconut oil. On it.  Then go from then. Am so shy I mean. Really shy. Sometimes am like lol. Really? That's embarrassing.
6348 2018-03-11 16:11:52 Exactly.  The collapse of oil prices from $100+ means Canadian oilsands are not always profitable.  Add in more natural gas from fracking and Canadian oil investment collapsed, leaving a mark. 
The collapse in foreign investment is resource price driven.
6349 2018-03-11 16:11:44 Why is there no such thing as “a quick ride out” when it comes to a motorbike  So I charged the battery. Topped up the oil. Lubricated the moving parts. And then thought “I’ll just pop out and get the tyre pressure done”. 26 miles later 
6350 2018-03-11 16:11:32 9-5 is how you survive, I ain’t trynna survive/ I’m trynna put my mama in rise, imma provide for the seeds I’m the soil/ teach em bout loyalty. teach em that their skin black like oil,that’s from royalty!
6351 2018-03-11 16:11:27 thank you! i haven't washed my hair in three days and it's greasy with argan oil lmao can u believe
6352 2018-03-11 16:11:21 It balances your skin and the honey is a humectant so it adds moisture without producing oil. It’s also a makeup remover. 

Pro-tip: apply to a dry face and use a hot, wet washcloth to remove. 

One of the most ethical companies you’ll find. They donate a ton of $ to charities.
6353 2018-03-11 16:11:14 "I'm going to cook up these tomatoes and garlic and such that you found. Maybe it's not a sauce as we'd think of it, but it works really well for spaghetti."

Nothing too fancy, as it turned out, as she soon put a little oil in the pan before adding the tomatoes to sizzle.
6354 2018-03-11 16:11:06 Meeting market demand with a product is wrong? When an arsonist burns down a house do you blame the oil companies because he used kerosene?

6364 2018-03-11 16:10:02 Try just trying to find a fat ass that is loyal enough to have rub baby oil on it before I get to work and clap them cheeks

It can be so simple. 


6365 2018-03-11 16:09:50 The whole time change thing is a waste of time. I spend the whole winter going to bed an hour early and waking up an hour early. Today I am back on track. We don't farm or live with oil lanterns anymore. Time to leave the damn clocks alone!
6366 2018-03-11 16:09:49 Buy new tires or buy a new car? Get an oil change or buy new car? Ugh decisions
6367 2018-03-11 16:09:43 You can eat it raw and cold. In a salad. But dry it out on paper towels before you do anything.
Soak up all the water in pt you can by pressing on it after cutting it into semi thin rectangles.
Medium heat skillet, coconut oil. Lay all the pieces you can on there and sautée
6368 2018-03-11 16:09:26 なるほど……
6369 2018-03-11 16:09:23 wow I was checking my oil and the oil dripped on my scarf & now I want to fight.
6370 2018-03-11 16:09:21 Aye and when we are independent and can borrow in our own right it will be treble  that. Thanks to renewables, oil, whisky etc. Bye bye labour. My old party. Never to be trusted again.
6371 2018-03-11 16:09:15 Nothing, NOTHING compares to the level of paranoia/feeling like a fraud that all men feel when getting their oil changed.  We. Do. Not. Know. How. Cars. Work. Either.
6372 2018-03-11 16:09:08 We are still in the stone age using oil and nuclear. All the clean alternatives are kept hush hush.
6373 2018-03-11 16:09:00 i need to go get a oil change

6375 2018-03-11 16:08:14 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

6383 2018-03-11 16:07:03 It’s not very healthy for your engine to just start it and go especially if you live in a cold place, or if you don’t use your car that much, & even more if you be flooring the poor thing you gotta let it warm up a little so the oil spreads & lubricates everywhere it needs to go

6387 2018-03-11 16:06:23 ya...but i believe they saw good in the guy that why they voted to end such...venezuela just need to revisit their foreign trade policies of oil and such..."venezuela first" lol..that will boost them...everything is not about capitol and socialism or communism..

6389 2018-03-11 16:06:03 What's that got to do with the price of cheese?  Right to Buy was not wrong.  What happened to the money, and the failure to build a house for everyone sold was absolutely tragic in management.  But heh, it't the UK - the only oil rich western country with no backup fund...
6390 2018-03-11 16:06:01 I already presented a solution. Cut off the flow of refined oil & gas products for a few weeks and these people will quickly broaden their views on the matter and start seeing sense

Pretty clear who funds his PAC, and he is in #Ontario to tell #pcpo that U.S. big oil will fund their PACs too. #ableg #cdnpoli #ucp #pcpoldr #cpc
6396 2018-03-11 16:05:40 @BigJoeBastardi Hi Joe, I like watching your forecasts, have for years. However you are too anti warming and it makes me concerned you have a oil companies agenda. I just watched a program on coral die caused by ocean warming and sea rise. More than just weather patterns eh!!!
6397 2018-03-11 16:05:34 After hours of waiting for the oil like faaaaaak
Sana effective pls 
6398 2018-03-11 16:05:28 ladies make sure you oil and massage your scalp at least twice a week, it reduces stress and reduces the sight or dandruff.
6399 2018-03-11 16:05:22 SERIOUSLY..BOTH OF YOU..GO ASK REAL HARD WORKING AMERICAN'S, LOGGERS, FISHERMEN, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, COAL MINERS, OIL PATCH WORKERS OR BORDER AGENTS..ABOUT BROKAW OR TODD OR FAKE NEWS..THE MAN'S IN A STREET FIGHT EVERYDAY BECAUSE FROM MINUTE ONE HE'S BEEN ATTACKED BY THE MEDIA.
6400 2018-03-11 16:05:17 We can't walk and chew gum at the same time, it seems. I'm tired of their excuses. "Oil is $50/bbl". Eh hehn?! When it was $140, what did y'all do? Chop and clean mouth. The rest of the continent is passing us. Our insecurity & instability doesn't help, either.

6403 2018-03-11 16:04:58 "Did you burn yourself?"

"No, the hot oil did."
6404 2018-03-11 16:04:37 Finally seen #BlackPanther and my take is that it’s Nigeria in a alternate universe where crude oil is vibranium and our leaders have the common sense to unite the tribes and use the crude oil to advance them collectively. #Imagine
6405 2018-03-11 16:04:36 I'd generally add more pesto or vusa it on the stove with olive oil
6406 2018-03-11 16:04:14 The US government does not sell oil. It's US-based companies. Why do you think they want USD in payment?
6407 2018-03-11 16:03:52 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it

6409 2018-03-11 16:03:43 You can use micellar water but can’t be rough on your skin. Best is cleansing oil or balm then double cleanse with normal cleanser. Using wipes while traveling is understandable, but don’t use it everyday.

6418 2018-03-11 16:02:37 My brother and I have been having this discussion for months, and my major points for the lack of innovation and invention (particularly in STEM) are corruption and oil resources. People feel they can make a quick buck in these country by just tapping into a corrupt system.
6419 2018-03-11 16:02:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*

6422 2018-03-11 16:02:07 lol....1) it is actually better managed 2) we have crude oil rents to collect so there will be enough to service debts....(for now)
6423 2018-03-11 16:01:57 Crude oil is natural too.  And organic.
And radiation.
And....
Anthropogenic impacts have to be seen in the context of Nature's own attempts to kill us. Many supposed issues are just rhe Natural Fallacy. But climate change is a real issue thats gonna mess us up if we dont fix it.

6431 2018-03-11 16:01:07 EVs are continually displacing the demand for oil worldwide. With the widespread adoption of EVs increasing, it is estimated that approximately 18 million barrels a day of fossil fuels could be saved by 2040.
6432 2018-03-11 16:01:00 Champagne objectives, beer budget. To be a superpower, you must also be a financial power. So long as oil prices are low, Russia will be a marginal power. You want to bring them to their knees? Start an arms race.

6434 2018-03-11 16:00:53 That's your fantasy, not facts
1- Yes we do need oil, for the next 50 to 100 yrs
2- Renewable energy cannot replace oil at this point
3- the oil industry adjusts production to match demand
4- Your eco-lunacy conspiracy theories don't exist

6435 2018-03-11 16:00:47 Love adding pineapple to all my pizzas. So sweet and tangy and amazing. Tortilla wraps filled with black beans (cooked with garlic and loads of olive oil then mixed with cooked rice) and toast pineapple is EVERYTHING.

6437 2018-03-11 16:00:32 This is something im researching. Have a brother w mental problems and they want to keep him medded up, not working. A pharmaceutical rep told me to get him started on the oil
6438 2018-03-11 16:00:30 I love Walden farms chocolate sauce!  I think I have almost all the same stuff minus the blueberry sauce. My fave snack right now is mini peppers with Spike seasoning and a spray of olive oil, but those peppers are sweet probably not keto friendly.

6445 2018-03-11 16:00:04 Ifs and buts means hips n butts. Likewise, 'If' opposition was united in 2014, a 31% vote majority govt would not have come into existence to ruin the economy that was on recovery path thanks to low oil prices. If wishes were horses...

6450 2018-03-11 15:59:51 UPA had to deal with a global recession & crippling oil prices. NDA had astonishingly low oil prices & no global crisis. Not to mention the gift of 1.5 - 2 % given by new GDP methodology! Ghosh's report utterly misleading. Otherwise we wouldn't be talking about Pakoda jobs!

6476 2018-03-11 15:56:27 Wake up Canada /these are protestors paid by Us to keep Canada’s oil in the ground so they can buy it cheap & sell theirs at high prices.  Think about it- there are no protestors in Texas are there?
6477 2018-03-11 15:56:25 I recently discovered my local fish and chip shop use palm oil.....I wonder how widespread this is?
6478 2018-03-11 15:56:17 Father, take houses, cars and land, but please don’t take Your oil from me!  

GLORYYYYY to GOD!

6480 2018-03-11 15:56:10 Costs are quite reasonable we are setting up service centres around London area at taxi garages and bosh service centres servicing every 12500 miles oil change , every 25000 miles air and fuel filter then every 50000 miles new spark plugs

What are y'all having for Passover???
6482 2018-03-11 15:56:08 —Mr van Beurden raised the possibility that demand for oil could peak 2025 if the world make a determined effort to fulfill the commitments they made in the Paris climate agreement. Mr Nasser, conversely, said he was “not losing any sleep over ‘peak oil demandʼ”.

6496 2018-03-11 15:53:59 Daddy wouldn't let me get my drivers license until I could change the oil, change a flat tire, jumo start or replace a battery and whatever else he could think of so he wouldn't have to do it.
6497 2018-03-11 15:53:58 He’s a “snake oil salesman”.
6498 2018-03-11 15:53:52 I'm thinking  it is to do with how the palm leaves may get spoilt with exposure to oil

6503 2018-03-11 15:52:50 From the guy that is paid to tell the oil and gas companies where to drill 
He's one of 5 peeps in the World employed to do this
6504 2018-03-11 15:52:35 No resistance demonstrated with sulfur or oil contact sprays, so it's not a problem to be dealt with. It's a few synthetic systemics that have encountered resistance.
6505 2018-03-11 15:52:33 It's just a little essential oil witchcraft that makes me feel less stuffed up. 
6506 2018-03-11 15:52:24 98 % people dont wan't more democracy. They want a mythical simpler world of prosperity & happiness . They'll vote for any snake oil saler promising  them this myth they crave for. I harbour no illusions about politics, give me cold technocrats above dream dealers anytime.

6512 2018-03-11 15:51:51 Uhh most of Venezuela's industry js private enterprise, so it is still a capitalist country... A country doesn't just turn socialist when the government nationalises a few things. Also I suspect the embargo and drop in oil prices had more of an effect on their economy than that.
6513 2018-03-11 15:51:40 I had a time I was obsessed with coconut oil I was making my white rice with it 
6514 2018-03-11 15:51:40 That is precisely why we use averages - to compare across periods. UPA had to deal with a global recession & crippling oil prices. NDA had astonishingly low oil prices & no global crisis to deal with. Not to mention the gift of 1.5 - 2 % that came with changing GDP methodology!
6515 2018-03-11 15:51:24 There is a reason oil is priced in USD. Why cannot the biggest buyers like Japan, India, China, Korea etc pay in their own currencies? Because Saudi won’t accept it! Why? Because there is a deal with US. That deal is about to fall apart. That’s the point.

6593 2018-03-11 15:42:30 There are really only two seasons:

Solid coconut oil
Liquid coconut oil

COCONUT OIL
6594 2018-03-11 15:42:28 My life with #iPhoneX for almost 4 months I feel like blessed with the display which resembles like an Oil painting   Thank You @Apple @tim_cook
6595 2018-03-11 15:42:23 Oh.. so we are back to the subsidy junkies routine.. well ask why JC is not in favour of casting the Scots adrift... could it possibly be that the Nukes moving to Portsmouth would be to much of a health hazard as the MOD stated... don't mention Oil revenues
6596 2018-03-11 15:42:23 Afghanistan’s major export is opium. We’re just protecting Big Pharma’s supply chain, just like with Big Oil’s supply in Iraq. #freedom
6597 2018-03-11 15:42:08 Try that with someone who is NOT familiar with it, INCLUDING... all the FORCED GOP amendments TO ObamaCare to make it not work. You are like a consumer blaming a car manufacture when your car fails because you did not provide basic maintenance: oil, brakes, radiator, etc...
6598 2018-03-11 15:42:01 boil chickpeas and garlic and salt/pepper, strain and reserve the water, blend with tahini and olive oil, add some of the reserved water to make your preferred thickness, add a squeeze of lemon juice and voila! delicious home made hummus! will get you actual measurements later 
6599 2018-03-11 15:41:57 funniest thing to ever happen on here was when twitter jawns was telling people to put coconut oil on ur face if u have acne and everyone pretended like it was good
6600 2018-03-11 15:41:10 "Training up" ???  Is that when a bunch of Barbies all sit around a table all talking about rainbow unicorns dancing in a meadow?  Wake up, the meadow is rehabilitated land from the oil sands.  #climateBarbie
6601 2018-03-11 15:41:09 Burning the midnight oil while missing you :')
6602 2018-03-11 15:41:04 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
6603 2018-03-11 15:41:03 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6604 2018-03-11 15:40:56 can’t believe it took me spending a long ass winter in central upstate ny with a partially bald ass head to realize....putting coconut oil on the shaved parts of ur scalp is a godsend

6611 2018-03-11 15:40:24 Saying liberals want America to be like Venezuela is just dumb. 

The problem with Venezuela is that government has control over the oil industry, their ONLY resource. After the price of oil fell in 2015, the Veneuzuelan government could no longer afford food for their citizens.
6612 2018-03-11 15:40:24 Aje Oil fields now make Lagos an oil producing state with huge returns. What's the sense in hiking Landuse charge instead of building modern landfills for trash?

6616 2018-03-11 15:39:48 Pretty sure the trillion dollar  banks will not allow that to happen.....they would rather buy them and shelve them,  just like how the car/ oil industry shelved electric cars back in the 70's.

6621 2018-03-11 15:39:32 If this meeting were to happen, Vlad will control it. Traitor Trump willingly obeys him. 
Kim probably has to be threatened that Vlad will stop sending him oil if he misbehaves.

6623 2018-03-11 15:39:13 The influence of the private sector over the public sector is especially stark at the EPA.

6624 2018-03-11 15:39:13 Jimson, it’s more about finding middle ground. The world is still using fossil fuels, Canada has the most stringent and safety guidelines in the world. Pipelines are the safest means of transporting oil and or gas. I don’t see you protesting on the ports of the St Lawrence.

6631 2018-03-11 15:38:24 Koch Admin, R's, and their rubber stamp are willing to add to the toxic mix, of the hurricane vulnerable red states along the Gulf of Mexico. Shouldn't Florida and Texas have been sufficient warning? Also add Canadian Tar Sands Oil to Houston. Whose going to pay to clean it up?
6632 2018-03-11 15:38:21 やはり抑止力が働いているのか！？！？！？(愕然)
6633 2018-03-11 15:38:16 Trump's not smart enough to be JR Ewing. If he's anything on the show Dallas, it's an oil well: Spewing toxic filth and making lots of money for rich people.
6634 2018-03-11 15:38:12 Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 happened less than 30 years ago. They wanted an un-corrupt Communist Party. Yet they just game this guy unlimited power. China is not Venezuela yet. Venezuela is rich with oil, gold, diamonds, but Chavez won the people, then took over the govt.
6635 2018-03-11 15:38:11 Mfks really think i wear make up . Babyyy nooo just lashes, lipgloss & coconut oil . I don’t shame whoever wear it cause if i could beat my own face i would . It’s just not my thing.. I’m pretty af without that shit .
6636 2018-03-11 15:38:10 Soon, if Trump has his way, the pristine American landscape of The Night Highway will be no more and will be only immortalized in fiction. There will be oil and gas drilling, etc. No more wide open wilderness and landscapes, no forest sunsets, no more "eerie lonely fog". I am mad
6637 2018-03-11 15:38:10 Not sure what to make of this since those of us following Ashton know the brain heals best without introducing GABA enhancers. I have been thinking of trying CBD oil but am wary of worsening my side effects during taper.  Did this person ct off xanax or was there a taper?

6654 2018-03-11 15:35:41 What happens is the Puget Sound imports fuel by less safe tankers and rail both of which put our aquatic environment at increased risk and we get more oil by rail which puts our environment at increased risk and Alberta drops its carbon fight a lose-lose-lose scenario

6664 2018-03-11 15:34:48 I worked on an oil project in Africa for a Chinese engineering and procurement firm. In their specifications there was a clause that steel and pipe manufactured in China was NOT to be utilized on the project. I guess they knew the quality of junk they were dumping in Canada.

6674 2018-03-11 15:33:19 And the other thing is that it took higher cost oil to bring usa oil industry back to where we are energy independant and will be #1 producer in a few years. Keeping steel in the .40 lb range instead of the low .30 will allow usa steel industry to rebuild too

6686 2018-03-11 15:31:59 My take home pay went up over $2k per year, yet I’ve lost thousands in my 401k due to oil stocks being down. Is there any way the treasury can replace my lost retirement money? By the way, most Trump voters begging for those low skill jobs back don’t own a nickel of stock.
6687 2018-03-11 15:31:55 drop oil on a chit of printed paper..it's finished..gets transparent...& you can't wash it with soap

Maybe one scented with a masculine scent and one scented with perfume I usually wear. What do you think?
6734 2018-03-09 23:53:59 Ooo, have you tried avocado oil? I have not, but I’ve read that its’ high smoke point works great for frying, & the best kind of frying is french frying. It’s just a suggestion, but please report back if you try it.
6735 2018-03-09 23:53:57 This S/B interesting.  
How much oil revenue will Alberta forego by shutting down the PL?
When gas prices rise, should the BC gov't subsidize gas prices while that happens? 
6736 2018-03-09 23:53:26 He is a fairly decent snake oil salesman, he has however said extremely sexist and islamaphobic trash
6737 2018-03-09 23:53:20 I don't presume that at all. Iraqs problem was all it's oil. NK isn't at risk of annexation because of resources
6738 2018-03-09 23:53:05 But $14k off of an even cheaper car makes less sense and will probably trigger more oil folks 
6739 2018-03-09 23:52:34 The snake oil element of what he's selling is that this is somehow his idea... which incidentally he's packaged in such a way as to cast doubt on whether it's worth taking your prescribed antidepressants.

It isn't his idea in the slightest, and he's profiting on misery.
6740 2018-03-09 23:52:30 I bought a new bottle of peppermint oil and made all of my coworkers put it on their temples and 5 minutes later they all started burning and breaking out. Double checked the bottle: “do not put on skin”. Today is cancelled. #pleasedontsueme

6780 2018-03-09 23:45:44 I have two types, i have a spray one which acts as the oil one, that doesn’t, but it gives it a nice juice. And i have a thicker syrup one which does! That goes better with something like halloumi :) x
6781 2018-03-09 23:45:36 Yea it was for the Bush's,BinLadens and all those who were invited to invest in the CarlisleGroup.That would have been everyone in the Bush administration,bankers,high up military psnl,oil execs,armament mfrs.That $4t+of borrowed $'s,is in their pockets to be repaid by taxpayers
6782 2018-03-09 23:45:32 As long as you dilute it with like coconut oil or almond oil you’re fine. The only risk is skin sensitivity, off the top of my head I can’t think of the oils you should avoid but I know clary sage is one of them
6783 2018-03-09 23:45:25 The Browns have turned the Friday dump into the Friday oil spill.

6793 2018-03-09 23:43:36 Perhaps for the holidays I can ship you these world famous banana maple pecan muffins I make. No oil, sugar or salt.
6794 2018-03-09 23:43:31 Easy question then. Yes or no. Does the city of Airdrie deem it appropriate to shame it's citizens that are having trouble making ends meet by hanging bright door hangers and charging them 25 dollars to do it? Maybe the Mayor won't mind answering either? @MayorPeterBrown
6795 2018-03-09 23:43:31 No, I'm afraid that you are 100% wrong. Norway's "oil fund" is invested in stocks, shares, bonds etc etc etc. They are the biggest stock holder in Europe. They take income from this "fund" worth over $1 Trillion, they use this you fund their benefits .... pensions etc

6800 2018-03-09 23:42:57 The burning of oil and coal releases sulfur dioxide which mixes with water droplets to create acid rain. This acidic rainfall has lowered the pH of mountain lakes in some places such that all aquatic life has died.
6801 2018-03-09 23:42:56 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
6802 2018-03-09 23:42:38 this bitch den left my oil cap off that’s why tf this car was smoking  ohhh im bout to bust them back windows TODAY
6803 2018-03-09 23:42:38 Those of us in the UK do not want war in Europe. Unlike those living overseas and supporting countries who do want war with Russia because she stands in the way of their intended aggrandisement of land, oil and pipelines. So please stop blaming Russia because it suits ur agenda.

6808 2018-03-09 23:42:04 Yes this kid wont see millions of acres of Fed Parks sold, Sold our east and west cost waiting for the spill to destroy our coast and billions from tourist, opened the Gulf coast to more oil, rammed pipe lines and destroyed your nation. yep thanks for nothing
6809 2018-03-09 23:42:04 Maybe because the Kurds were smuggling the oil?
6810 2018-03-09 23:41:21 Sent @POTUS a letter asking him to preserve our coasts/not allow coastal drilling. Rec'd a generic response talking about how Americans needed energy independence.

Why the tariffs on solar then? Oh yeah, and under Obama our reliance on foreign oil was at a 30 year low.
6811 2018-03-09 23:41:14 Here’s a thought, if you people didn’t force the oil platforms to drill in water a mile or more deep, maybe it would be a lot easier to inspect or fix possible leaks. But that would involve common sense so....
6812 2018-03-09 23:41:12 Yep, everyone East were welfare bums... until crude oil price went crashing down.

6821 2018-03-09 23:40:01 Exactly. If we produce more than we need, then export the rest. Sadly, now, we export raw dil bit, and import oil. That seems wrong headed.
6822 2018-03-09 23:39:51 I bet everybody is giving you million things to try. I was desperate and I refused to put corticosteroids on me. I tried Emu oil and it was magic!!! Also aloe vera for immediate relief. Hope you feel better

6828 2018-03-09 23:38:31 I mean, COAL? It's not even the go-to fossil fuel of choice. If you want a cheap modern carboniferous source, then all that fracking in Texas is where the money's at.

Thousands are employed, billions are being made, the USA is the biggest oil producer.

Naaah doesn't FEEL right.

6835 2018-03-09 23:36:55 Your part of the problem. If you just going to criticize Assad, and then say there is no better option, what do you think will happen? It is simply chaos. Look at Libya now, it's a disaster, the west still getting their oil though.

6843 2018-03-09 23:34:59 Not all Albertans agree with this pipeline; some want a govt that stands up for the interests that aren't oil companies. Are you saying you think the govt should ignore interests you don't personally agree with?

I supported EE, but not KXL. Torn on TransMountain.
6844 2018-03-09 23:34:43 For the oil

So we can cook things.  Really
6845 2018-03-09 23:34:19 Your president just put a tariff on solar panels. Solar employs around 200,000 people in the US. A school near me just went totally solar. No electric bills for approx. 30 years. Oil money speaks louder than common sense.

6850 2018-03-09 23:33:51 We know current Alberta oil activity is a source of $$ for BC suppliers and Canadian taxes. As gas consumers do we see a benefit? Is Burnaby's refinery promised any more supply? Does KM avoid taxes? Are we redrawing Provincial Park boundaries for them?

6860 2018-03-09 23:32:26 Will have a think about it because of two days of bad weather I will probably need that for extra oil as the sods have taken 2 weeks so far with no delivery. Pay day 25th. Ha maybe the wife will do an extra overtime shift

6863 2018-03-09 23:32:04 Straw-man argument. As an avid diver, I'm adimately opposed to that. It's not justification for a 7x increase in oil tanker traffic. That's a fools logic.

6878 2018-03-09 23:29:36 I’ll comment! Thank you! On a side note, spent the day rendering organic, grass-fed beef leaf fat to use for sautéing rather than vegetable oil! It’s AMAZING and much healthier than heated vegetable oil.

6881 2018-03-09 23:29:08 I'm horrified that people still put coconut oil on their face
6882 2018-03-09 23:28:57 One of the perks of buying a brand new car is free oil changes 
6883 2018-03-09 23:28:41 *me watching a food video*
“That’s a shit ton of olive oil! Whole milk? Heavy cream? AND cheese?! Oh yeah, might as well add some damn bacon. Why don’t you just put the whole stick of butter in there while you’re at it? MORE CHEESE?!” 
*would probably still eat anyway*
6884 2018-03-09 23:28:26 hehe :) cannabis helps... finish work, roll yourself a nice one... eat some oil... start the weekend :) don't worry about the shit that you shouldn't be worrying :)

6889 2018-03-09 23:27:43 #Warcraft Felwood also has an abundance of Flasks of Oil, Hearts of Fire,  and Silk/Mageweave cloth as well. Gems from my previous post (expanded) include Star Ruby, Living Essence, Lesser Moonstone, Black Vitriol, and Citrine. Overall, not a lot of reagents - but a nice variety.

6891 2018-03-09 23:26:56 Kemkaran-Humble makes it closer. 4-2 Tigers. Still in the 2nd.
6892 2018-03-09 23:26:54 Asian demand, getting oil out of the Midwest is harder than to it since pipelines run to it and not away from it, worries that Cushing storage space was running out, imports from Canada, etc etc.
6893 2018-03-09 23:26:45 Pathetic how the @BCLIberals support tar sands and dirty oil over the people of BC. That is how it was under Christy Clark, big corporations first including #Kindermorgan. #BCLIbs are Shameful and do not represent BC. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
6894 2018-03-09 23:26:43 You. Would have to be an idiot not to understand that the amount of petrol driven vehicles alone on this planet wernt causing some kind of damage and yeh theres other factors like deforistation on mass also and of course coal only 140 years of oil left nothing lasts forever
6895 2018-03-09 23:26:10 Add oil to a fire.
6896 2018-03-09 23:25:43 Yep, and All Texas has to do is shut down the oil & gas pipeline and NY will come to screeching halt. Remember the '70's!
6897 2018-03-09 23:25:28 go get the oil!

6901 2018-03-09 23:24:39 A seven year sentence isn't that long of a time, but what if was stipulated that he spent that time in, say, an oil drum? #shkreli
6902 2018-03-09 23:24:24 Weird satisfying things:
- soft ice
- sound of crunchy leaves
- sound of crunchy snow
- watching pimples being popped
- watching eyebrows being waxed
- the sound of slime
- mixing oil colors
- the sound of my back cracking 
- putting on chapstick in windy weather
6903 2018-03-09 23:23:31 Highly suggest looking into CBD oil
6904 2018-03-09 23:22:55 Deadbeats always expect "someone else" to provide the oil which gases up their car and puts their planes in the air.

6906 2018-03-09 23:22:35 African black soap, saint Ives peach scrub, mask of mcminty I think that’s how you spell it, it’s at lush, tea tree oil, not to much or your skin will over produce its natural oils, then use Burt’s bee toner, and go in with a really good moisturizer. I use this Hawaiian brand.
6907 2018-03-09 23:22:27 UK is a poor country wiyh huge debt & interest with no oil or mineral assets to offset this 2nd when Labout spent 13 years in power far fewer homes buily 3rd prioritising on need mean single people have 0 chance of housing whilst foreign families who left their homes get priority

6914 2018-03-09 23:21:49 bi oil c'est la vie
6915 2018-03-09 23:21:28 If Syria had oil we would have been in years ago - but they have nothing we want . It’s that simple . Have you made this point ?
6916 2018-03-09 23:21:23 That should be in the 25-40 range.
An oil change should only cost $100 if you own a Maserati lol
6917 2018-03-09 23:21:21 omg sorry i forgot to reply! i usually just exfoliate w anything really  and use pearlessence radiance perfecting serum + valjean labs glow mist + argan oil + vivo moisturizer 
6918 2018-03-09 23:21:20 can’t just pretend that nothing has happened. My next question or two in the oil and gas. 4/4
6919 2018-03-09 23:21:17 I am 24 years old and i have been masturbating for the last 11 years. Recently I started using coconut oil as lubricant during masturbation. Is it safe? Also I would to have oral sex with myself. Is it possible by any yoga position?
6920 2018-03-09 23:21:14 Oil or No Oil.
I need a whole haircut
6921 2018-03-09 23:21:09 What was it? My friend Darren recommends French fries -- salt, oil, so on.
6922 2018-03-09 23:20:07 This is insane!! An oil spill and a generational hurricane all at once.  Why not throw in a few tornados and an attack by China while you’re at it.
6923 2018-03-09 23:19:55 Just did my oil change and breaks on the evo now time to relax and eat hot Cheetos and watch initial D
6924 2018-03-09 23:19:50 My skin is starting to clear up a little. I stopped using coconut oil on my face and switch to almond.
6925 2018-03-09 23:19:34 It makes lots of cents & lots of Yuan. It is nuts to let a unified tyrannical nation compete in the world economy. Its like Standard Oil on a much scale; lower prices, dump product on market, drive competition out of business, become a monopoly. It is folly 4 US to lose metal mfg
6926 2018-03-09 23:19:34 Oh, that is so right. So now. Me? - full baguette with olive oil/salt/balsamic followed by bowl of Golden Grahams for dessert. BANG BANG.
6927 2018-03-09 23:19:31 Put coconut oil in my hair tonight n now I smell like a bounty
6928 2018-03-09 23:19:12 It was olive oil, garlic, mozzarella, bacon, scallions, and globs of mashed potato. Crust was good! Mashed potatoes tasted fine but was a little gritty

6943 2018-03-09 23:16:15 VANCOUVER gas prices.
Supply is short, prices are high... This shouldn't be happening in Canada. When will BC realize that ALBERTA oil is good for all of Canada.
6944 2018-03-09 23:16:14 Nice use of the oil money from papa
6945 2018-03-09 23:16:13 Greasing your scalp with tea tree & argan oil, while subsequently rubbing down your feet with Palmers cocoa butter lotion is my #LoveLanguage 
6946 2018-03-09 23:15:54 Change is hard but if you cannot change, or as I like to say "adapt", you will surely be left behind. My son worked as an artist & carpenter & when those jobs dried up, he went to work in the oil fields. When oil went to less than $50/bbl, he found another blue-collar "career".
6947 2018-03-09 23:15:53 Iraq is all about the Oil.   Worked there & saw it
6948 2018-03-09 23:15:51 If made correctly you can't really tell. You can get away with less oil though. Just depends on what you're looking for taste and texture wise.

6954 2018-03-09 23:13:13 The DOW closes Friday up 441 points as jobs growth vastly exceeds expectations. Crude oil, meanwhile, jumps a buck and 92 cents on the day. Have a great weekend, everyone! #GoodToLiveInAGreatNation
6955 2018-03-09 23:13:11 Just don't think I've forgotten about when you were all doing oil pulling. Because I haven't.
6956 2018-03-09 23:13:05 Sure, in your mind that's every 'gun owners' dream .. isn't it?  But, in my 'gun oil fueled dream', the 'bad guys' would be leaving in the body bags..

6963 2018-03-09 23:12:09 I’m surprised it’s mostly oil!!
6964 2018-03-09 23:12:08 is oil turned into a lone wolf trade or is this coming dollar rally finally going to start it moving lower??

6986 2018-03-09 23:09:45 Yup! Coconut oil.
6987 2018-03-09 23:09:35 What’s wrong with drilling? I think it’s good that we may no longer have to rely on foreign oil
6988 2018-03-09 23:09:22 Your 'feels' aren't worth much.  Evidence works far better.
6989 2018-03-09 23:09:13 Wow! Fancy olive oil. What a wonderful gift. I rarely buy olive oil anymore. Yes a very good neighbor, I'm sure you are a good neighbor, too.
6990 2018-03-09 23:09:09 I was working at some oil chemical plants when i we made that team
6991 2018-03-09 23:08:53 I been on that oil again lately 
6992 2018-03-09 23:08:36 I usually start with olive oil. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes. Throw about 4oz if water in. Throw a lid on and blanch for about 3 minutes. The remove the lit. Throw on some balsamic, turn the heat up and flash off the liquid which caramelizes the vinegar just a touch.
6993 2018-03-09 23:08:20 Weird I looked up car oil now Twitter got ads for it

7006 2018-03-09 23:06:18 pretty much. Happens when you've got a delusional GM/Owner/Pres that has a huge stake in the oil business, on top of everything else.
7007 2018-03-09 23:05:50 Or baby oil and just grab a fold
7008 2018-03-09 23:05:39 I was working in some chemical oil plants with a big huge flame flare and upgrading firefighting when that team was made J of my name
7009 2018-03-09 23:05:36 @aphriainc  Please tweet a recipe for Greek potatoes infused with oil
7010 2018-03-09 23:05:20 Yeah I really like it, I'll only get it in the oil cans though lol
7011 2018-03-09 23:05:20 Here in New England, they're fighting new hydropower from Quebec, insisting on 100% conservation to meet needs.  Which really means, more fossil power, more people staying with oil heated homes.
7012 2018-03-09 23:05:15 Veganizing your favorite recipes is actually super easy. For instance, I made cookies the other day, and all I had to do was replace the exploitation and slaughter with coconut oil and oat milk

7022 2018-03-09 23:03:44 Anyway I have applied herb infused coconut oil I made for the skin. Chamomile, lavender, and marigold. That will work a treat.
7023 2018-03-09 23:03:23 A lil nap after those two oil changes sounds fresh
7024 2018-03-09 23:03:09 Is grapeseed oil better than Olive Oil ?
7025 2018-03-09 23:02:51 I toss them in a tad of Olive oil, a tad of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper and roast them in a hot oven. Love!
7026 2018-03-09 23:02:49 Did a wash n go with the Flaxseed Black Castor oil Eco styler gel what have i been doing this whole time?! This is the plug!

7030 2018-03-09 23:02:02 Wish I knew how to change my own oil for my car 
7031 2018-03-09 23:01:54 While others groan, you will grow & like Asher dip ur feet in oil for grace & prosperity. Ur feet shall be as iron to crush Satan's head
7032 2018-03-09 23:01:33 This traditional extraction process preserves the nutty aroma and all the benefits of the golden oil. It takes a whole argan tree which grows only in Morocco to make 2 litres of argan oil per year.
7033 2018-03-09 23:01:30 Scalp scratch and a baby oil massage.... is all i want!
7034 2018-03-09 23:01:24 Charles—It’s gifs (like ‘g’ in gift). “Jifs” are peanut butter jars and “Jiffy” is where you get a cheap oil change. #MTPDaily
7035 2018-03-09 23:01:12 Coastal California is full of Trumpsters. What a great gift a huge noisy stinking oil rig will be to their 20 million plus homes. Oh and an accident? Yeah that’s a good one when the entire coast is covered in oil.
7036 2018-03-09 23:01:06 That's a big question to answer over social media, can you call our utilities department to talk with a person about this? 403-948-8859.
7037 2018-03-09 23:01:06 There were several times the mayor was able to speak to the reality that the need for oil will remain for years to come, and a pipeline is the safest, most efficient and least carbon emission creating vehicle to get our product to the world market.
7038 2018-03-09 23:01:04 j'esperais que le coconut oil apaise mes démangeaisons de piqûres de puces de sable, mais nope 
7039 2018-03-09 23:00:58 Also CBD oil is now legal everywhere. No longer scheduled in US for the last couple years.
7040 2018-03-09 23:00:57 Craig!!! Look up the crude oil price!! Then ask yourself why they are different. Maybe they are not misleading but they are talking about apples, not pears. Or maybe like most multi-nationals and politicians they just lie through their teeth. Follow the money, check the facts
7041 2018-03-09 23:00:57 and massage the oil into your scalp real good lol

7044 2018-03-09 23:00:43 Too many lives, all precious, lost to make evil men rich?  e.g. Genie Energy oil co in occupied #Syria #Golan? You accept that you are being used, but how much?
Trump rips up trade deals, nuclear treaties, how much you trust him? His motives?
7045 2018-03-09 23:00:19 To give your skin a sexy sheen in seconds, fill a spray bottle with a dry body oil and mist it all over right after you shower #skincaretip #beautytip
7046 2018-03-09 23:00:19 yes, i do exactly that.
last night, my next door neighbor came by and gave me a new, fancy bottle of olive oil. he said he'd had extras at his job, so he brought his neighbors some.
nice guy, huh :))
7047 2018-03-09 23:00:09 Señor Chilli is back!

7048 2018-03-09 22:59:50 Singapore doesn't have vast oil reserves/petrodollars to my knowledge... Unless they vassalised Malaysia or Indonesia without me noticing 
7049 2018-03-09 22:59:49 So, while we still have to rely upon oil, maybe we can use our own, is my thought.
7050 2018-03-09 22:59:44 You know it’s a good day when you discover an oil leak in your car! :)
7051 2018-03-09 22:59:38 Using baby oil in or after my shower is sooo Much better than any moisturiser #silkysmoothskin #babyoilisthewaytogo

7056 2018-03-09 22:59:05 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
7057 2018-03-09 22:59:03 The oil change guy pulled out the air filter and now can't figure out how to put it back in. I went to help but he kicked me out.
7058 2018-03-09 22:59:00 My 17yo son-in-law has a P reg Micra 1.0 nothing (no rear wiper, no cig lighter), he bought it for £200 with 43k miles on it. He’s done 16k this year with nothing more than 2 oil changes.
His insurance is £2800...

7067 2018-03-09 22:56:40 Truth is Governor, wind, you little fanasy is as destructive as oil drilling, but your warped sense of our reallity shows you care nothing about the environment.
7068 2018-03-09 22:56:27 castor oil, hot oil treatments, wash once a week, i condition my hair more than i shampoo it tho. cornrows are a must. & almond oil.
7069 2018-03-09 22:56:22 None of the above. I just said I wouldn't invest in snake oil. That's my choice. And your kind harms public health.
7070 2018-03-09 22:55:51 I want to start oil painting so bad but I’m so broke right now

7079 2018-03-09 22:53:25 There still are such kind ppl in this world and I’d like to thank the 2 men that didn’t charge me for an oil change bc I had a bad day.. means a lot
7080 2018-03-09 22:53:25 This is around the time of year I start craving a nice glowy tan and the smell of tanning oil.
7081 2018-03-09 22:53:15 And that’s how the engineering side of the oil industry has been set up - people engaged through agencies. Other industries caught on (e.g. the NHS) using supposedly temporary staff but the reality is many are as permanent as corporate staff. Easier to dispose of through...
7082 2018-03-09 22:53:00 I hate when I’m at the dealership and they tell me everything that’s wrong with my car. I know..I just want my oil changed though.
7083 2018-03-09 22:52:17 Oil and water don’t mix well so they naturally separate themselves
7084 2018-03-09 22:51:57 You need to shut it. Why is it so bad to use our own oil? It will cut the cost at the pump. We won’t be paying for foreign oil, but using our own and putting many to work.
7085 2018-03-09 22:51:46 Don't forget carbon 60 in olive oil.
7086 2018-03-09 22:51:43 @Fergo__ need to Amazon Prime ship that oil he has to me real rap. You need to hold one for me fam

7088 2018-03-09 22:51:34 I see Frank stocked up on his oil and edibles... 
7089 2018-03-09 22:51:15 I don't need oil as a fuel. I'm buying an EV in the next couple months. I had to tackle the hurdle of installing a charge station first. There is a difference between wanting action and taking action. Oil will always be around, I know this. Oil as a fuel for burning is a waste.
7090 2018-03-09 22:51:11 
7091 2018-03-09 22:51:06 those 5 would take my a lot of time to finish :) would have to skip the oil and clear my lungs :)

7096 2018-03-09 22:49:47 Sometimes if you see a specialist or go to a nicer mechanic it’ll be expensive, or they’ll do extra shit like vacuum and that can cost extra? But $75 is -a lot-. Find a Pennysaver and get yourself a 19.99 oil change.
7097 2018-03-09 22:49:37 I see the problem, they've got an oil leak........
7098 2018-03-09 22:49:37 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and Putin can frame Trump as well as his  sourcing, I think they probably just want to give trump the finger.

7122 2018-03-09 22:45:27 It’s the employer that controls the agency situation. I went to an interview in 1979 to be told the job was an agency position - I had been misled by them (an oil company). It’s a means of recruiting when the employer hasn’t  got the confidence and commitment to their business.

7128 2018-03-09 22:45:01 Is $75-100 normal for just an oil change in the bay area? Or is that insane? because it feels insane. 

I totally admit when this guy asked what kind of oil I’d want I said “idunno” but uh, no: I’m not /THAT/ dumb about cars, dude.

7132 2018-03-09 22:44:47 Is Canada poor?

This oil battle only makes sense if Canada is seriously poor. We simply cannot survive unless we trample on civil liberties and destroy the nation itself (physically) in the name of a cash grab. How poor is Alberta that this is the only option?
7133 2018-03-09 22:44:19 Only where there is oil.  Duh.
7134 2018-03-09 22:44:16 I just get it off amazon girl, any virgin coconut oil will do the work really. I put it on an hour before taking shower or you can put it on the night before and leave it. It’s amazing it makes your hair super soft

7154 2018-03-09 22:41:48 Holy shit!  I wouldn't have noticed (or expected!). Was it made with truffle oil of something?!  For pete's sake...
7155 2018-03-09 22:41:47 Agreed. Do they give world wide demand and supply predictions for oil in 2025 and do they price it based on that analysis or is it only for lithium?

7164 2018-03-09 22:39:50 I like to to rub olive oil on me and sit out in the sun as I pretend to be a French fry
7165 2018-03-09 22:39:42 I think visited Toysrus more as an adult killing time while my oil was getting changed more than I ever saw one as a kid.
7166 2018-03-09 22:39:37 That just means that thousands of ppl for whom u think u are better than will have good jobs & a way to feed their families but i guess youd rather continue to buy oil from countries who use the money to kill ppl! U should probably worry about all the rapist hollywood produces!!!
7167 2018-03-09 22:39:01 Oilers respond 2 mins later with a PP goal of their own. 1-1. Semeniuk with the goal.
7168 2018-03-09 22:38:50 Then quit being obtuse. The oil sands are not "controlled" by foreign entities. Yes, they have a significant presence, which is good for the Canadian market.
7169 2018-03-09 22:38:47 From TN, eh? No pic so let’s see if I can describe you. MAGA hat on top of your mullet, tobacco spit stains down your Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirt, sleeves ripped off, barely covering your Busch beer gut, oil stained jeans. BTW, the pics you posted are hilarious...thanks for sharing!
7170 2018-03-09 22:38:39 Ok can someone just tell me because I’m confused and I don’t know where else to look. Is CBD oil legal in Ohio? #MedicalMarijuana #anxiety
7171 2018-03-09 22:38:33 They're about to find oil in the Bida basin any day now? I'm a little sceptical but is this likely or possible?
7172 2018-03-09 22:38:27 Are you willing to give up sanitation, health care, longevity, medicine, wealth, prosperity, equality, education, science, freedom, geopolitical stability, stable grid, peace for some falsified models? Think again! Folks in NE would have been slaughtered if it wasn’t for big oil.
7173 2018-03-09 22:38:19 If you have it, put a few drops lavender essential oil in the water.
7174 2018-03-09 22:38:18 We already ship oil through pipelines through BC. We aren't cutting it off, we oppose expansion at BC's expense

7176 2018-03-09 22:38:10 Those are the only points you actually have mostly correct. The oil can go to any market, including PADD 5 refineries capable of running high TAN heavy.
7177 2018-03-09 22:38:09 1/ When you clean leather, you're removing the fats and oils that were originally added during the tanning process. After your leather is clean and dry, you add thin coats of oil to replace them. However, that doesn't make the leather soft or shiny.

7179 2018-03-09 22:37:32 Heres to hoping my job gets me a discount so I can finally invest in oil paint and cry over the cost at not-full price
7180 2018-03-09 22:37:12 Thank you NY AG Eric Schneiderman, for standing ready to fight against oil pollution along the NY coast if Trump’s plans to allow oil drilling to go forward. Protecting our environment and economy matters. If Florida got an exemption from offshore drilling, so, too, should NY.
7181 2018-03-09 22:37:02 if it were for the global control of oil - why is it that the US has had to exploit shale oil etc and become its own supplier
7182 2018-03-09 22:36:56 @Audi had a recall for oil consumption got the level 2 repair. Pistons and rings.  Tech somehow allowed my timing chain guide to wear in to my timing cover. Also leaking valve cover.  Not a happy customer
7183 2018-03-09 22:36:43 My F150 is 20 yrs old. I change oil every 3K miles, new brakes/rotors when necessary, repair any leaks (like differential) etc., Truck is GREAT. Best vehicle ever. Hope it lasts another 20 years.

7192 2018-03-09 22:35:04 Senator, there is no oil and gas reserves off the coast of RI. 

How much time and effort is you state spending on this. Soon you will be complaining about attempts to destroy RI palm trees.
7193 2018-03-09 22:34:56 I can’t wait to get started! I’m still a little confused about the difference between the saddle oil and the conditioner, but I’m going to follow your directions to the letter!!
7194 2018-03-09 22:34:38 Here's a point ... I told you that Norway had a $1 Trillion oil fund, you did not say "where did they get that" why ... because it's obvious
7195 2018-03-09 22:34:35 everyone thinks these oilfield men are pervs or whateva, yet me and @kaylee_matta just witnessed an oil field guy park in the middle off the road and help two little kids cross cedar street 
7196 2018-03-09 22:34:25 Put peppermint oil on my pillows so I can breathe it works! But after a while is like it a burn up my nasal passage.

7204 2018-03-09 22:33:47 Any time I go to get my oil changed I can feel the workers judging me for not changing my own oil
7205 2018-03-09 22:33:41 This morning I overheard two men speaking in the library. One of them had googled the amount of oil a train car would carry. His conclusion, "way better to have the ‘spill' in the water where the oil would disappear." Yikes!
7206 2018-03-09 22:33:37 Guess there was enough liquidity to juice the indexes and oil today.  What decides this indicator?

7213 2018-03-09 22:32:53 You want existing North Sea Oil to provide a trillion dollar fund while not producing petrol or any fossil fuel energy. You have no argument.
7214 2018-03-09 22:32:43 You have absolutely no clue. I would never invest in any homeopathy snake oil that hurts public health. You have no credibility, nor knowledge, nor any care for the world.

7217 2018-03-09 22:31:39 Yep! The US will be energy independent and the biggest producer of oil on the planet! Winning!!
7218 2018-03-09 22:31:38 Try tea tree oil!! That helped me the most this last time, I got my piercings like 5 years apart and  it happened w both of them. I’ve also heard that healing w hoops can irritate it but I think that’s debatable
7219 2018-03-09 22:31:34 I bought a $1.50 tea tree oil and mint hair mask at Wal-Mart and my hair has never felt better but I know my stylist would have a cow
7220 2018-03-09 22:31:30 I change my own car oil can't pay no one for that 
7221 2018-03-09 22:31:06 Changed my oil...in the cold. Can’t feel anything #fuckoffwinter
7222 2018-03-09 22:30:41 I've followed mine across three different salons. It's seriously like therapy when she does my hair--and sometimes she, like, massages my scalp with 'soothing peppermint oil' after. 
7223 2018-03-09 22:30:39 But you don’t need to make it worse - one major oil spill can destroy way more than just the California coastline, it has a global effect - marine habitats and marine life are already endangered

7227 2018-03-09 22:30:27 Attitude found among Canadian elites. People & organizations who think themselves most important believe they deserve largest shares of national wealth (the cake). So, we subsidize massive international oil companies and deny assistance to people most in need. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
7228 2018-03-09 22:30:19 Come on The 2nd invasion was never justifiable & it was done to control oil supply in the middle east & world oil prices, nothing more.

7234 2018-03-09 22:29:19 We have gone from booze to oil funds to electric cars to polymer and bitumens, I think that Brucie is a zoomer
7235 2018-03-09 22:29:18 This is real... there was even a maple syrup heist once in Quebec that offset global market prices of maple syrup since it’s more expensive than oil per barrel

7241 2018-03-09 22:28:00 this rosehip oil thing i’m doing for my face is really saving my life
7242 2018-03-09 22:27:54 Apparently you can't. But no worries, I have no doubt that we will see a video clip soon of about 30+ times where @jkenney says that if BC keeps blocking KM #TMX we need to cut off their oil, diesel & jet fuel deliveries to smarten them up.
7243 2018-03-09 22:27:46 Sat at Chevy getting my oil changed for 2 hours today and now I just popped my tire and my rim is fucked. I can’t catch a break 
7244 2018-03-09 22:27:44 Why do so many governments suck up to the Saudi regime? Oil isn’t the future and the money will run out eventually.

7248 2018-03-09 22:27:07 There is no positive to Ethanol,  burns dirty, low horse power, gums up engines - America is becoming the leader in oil production & will be self sufficient in a few years the blending is not needed - especially on tax payer $$ - maybe we will ship more corn to N. Korea for food
7249 2018-03-09 22:27:01 It's super easy to make at home. You just need a blender and a butt load of garlic, some lemon, salt and oil. 

It's amazing on almost anything
7250 2018-03-09 22:26:55 I understand why international oil companies are not developing refining capacity in NA. I understand that it costs a lot of money to build and operate refineries in NA. There’s little return on massive investment. Exporting bitumen is easier money for oil companies.

7273 2018-03-09 22:24:20 The spill in Vancouver harbour mentioned in the article took almost a day to be responded too. A spill in Howe Sound recently took a similar amount of time for response. Our world class oil spill response has trouble responding to minor diesel spills in a timely manner.
7274 2018-03-09 22:24:14 wasn't just loud, it sounded awful, very screechy, the oil pressure was also super high, and our engineer friend who has had Diesel engines and generators for 30+ years also said it needed service :P
7275 2018-03-09 22:24:13 Hmmm... the 1941 oil cut-off surely helped precipitate Pearl Harbor. In turn, Pearl Harbor did unify and motivate the American people. Downside risk is much more grave...hmmmm...

7297 2018-03-09 22:20:44 Is there no limit to where they have to drill for oil? When it is all sucked out of the ground we can have massive earthquakes.
7298 2018-03-09 22:20:42 NHS was ww2 x party concept implemented by Labour post war coz they won election. Labour abstained on Tory austerity which SNP tries to mitigate with reduced funds. SNP have kept nurses bursary. Scot has given £480b in oil revs to WM why winter fuel allowance? McCrone.Iraq. 'Vow'
7299 2018-03-09 22:20:41 Do you think that oil only makes petrol ...... really?????

7311 2018-03-09 22:19:39 Let's not give away our oil like we give away everything else.  Let's use our oil to help rebuild America.
7312 2018-03-09 22:19:39 Oh right, you think that oil only makes petrol ! ! ! ! ye Gods, are you for real Bruce??
7313 2018-03-09 22:19:37 I find it remarkable that in almost 12 years of ownership, (with regular maint at 5k intervals), I've never ONCE had to add oil to my Camry V6. It's to the point where I stopped checking years ago b/c why bother.
7314 2018-03-09 22:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
7315 2018-03-09 22:19:25 tryna decide if I want to clean my room, study, wash clothes, go workout, take a nap, go get an oil change or do the dishes :)
7316 2018-03-09 22:19:15 Green energy is the future. Make the infrastructure. Any logical engineer will tell you anything is possible. This planet is heating up from fossil fuels. One oil spill off the east coast will disrupt huge economies in every state along the coast.
7317 2018-03-09 22:19:00 まだ10才だから焦ることはないよ
7318 2018-03-09 22:18:58 Until the time when everyone is running around in a electric vehicle then the need for fossil fuel remains a necessity. We currently pull 10.1 million barrels a day in five years up to 15.  Not only will we be totally independent of foreign influence for oil we will be better off
7319 2018-03-09 22:18:48 Congrats on joining our PT Oil of the Month family, @VoicesChoirVan ! We sure hope you love them as much as we do!
7320 2018-03-09 22:18:46 Bikes and Segways need oil to be designed, produced, transported and serviced; so does everything else on planet Earth, I’m not saying these locations are necessary and there’s a case for them not to be developed but the world runs on oil.
7321 2018-03-09 22:18:45 Thinking of getting canabis oil for my back pain and my PTSD..... Not sure
7322 2018-03-09 22:18:44 How much is the cbd oil?
7323 2018-03-09 22:18:31 World oil/gas projects have been stagnant over this period. Recent 20% hike in oil prices may be reason for this increased productivity as projects come back online (+ fall in value of pound)
7324 2018-03-09 22:18:20 Does it kind of feel like your car is stuttering? My car has been doing the same thing lately and I’ve found that it’s either the spark plugs or lack of oil. In order to stop it, I have to add oil usually.

7326 2018-03-09 22:18:15 Now, if it's saponified coconut oil, that's different. But just straight up coconut oil, like in a moisturizer? 
7327 2018-03-09 22:18:13 Depends on the (rising) oil prices, Brent crude is doing very well thank you, but you will know that eh???

7330 2018-03-09 22:17:15 This gives economics, and economists a bad name. We need better language to differentiate objective social scientists from snake oil salesmen. At the moment in the public eye economists are the latter.
7331 2018-03-09 22:17:09 was basically a slip and slide with all that oil on the floor of the gym lmao
7332 2018-03-09 22:17:08 Yes I think oil too?

7338 2018-03-09 22:16:27 More hypocrisy from @SecretaryZinke  Open up public lands and sea costs to be plundered by big oil...but not in his state of Montana.  Let other communities, other wild life, other waterways be plundered.

7339 2018-03-09 22:16:19 Can't wait. Gives me something to watch while i wait for an oil change.
7340 2018-03-09 22:16:17 We need oil and we also have to consider when we may run out
7341 2018-03-09 22:16:08 I never believed d Economy is that hard 

Until I saw my friend eating bread with anointing oil

7342 2018-03-09 22:15:37 Oil is important to Scotland. However, it sits within a great wealth of  many natural resources available to Scotland. In terms of energy alone,  Scotland is developing an international pedigree in tidal, wave and wind
7343 2018-03-09 22:15:34 Olive oil is fruit juice: change my mind.

7352 2018-03-09 22:14:49 Nothing feels better than putting rosehip oil on my dry ass face after a long day of wearing makeup. 
7353 2018-03-09 22:14:37 Meh. Fast train SYD to MEL would be a boondoggle. Perhaps we should fix public transport and reduce then eliminate oil for transportation first.
7354 2018-03-09 22:14:36 As for the safety of my children, and all children, I am far more concerned about the risks posed by incompetent doctors, Big Pharma, Big Ag, Big Oil, Alcohol and Drug users, and the Big Intel/Data companies than I am about firearms.
7355 2018-03-09 22:14:36 SHELL OIL SPILL
7356 2018-03-09 22:14:31 How is it a compromise though? So BC has to sacrifice our coastline industries, our wildlife, and our environment so Albertans and a US oil company can make ridiculous amounts of money? BC would only get mostly temporary jobs. Less than what would be lost in tourism and fisheries
7357 2018-03-09 22:14:29 New timing chain, oil change and Daytons for feet! #StoneMountain here we come before the lunatics get ideas in their demented heads?! How come #JesseWaters won't reach over and plant a tapioca upside Juans head?! #TheFive

7360 2018-03-09 22:13:52 PLEASE remind #US that #Florida has been eliminated from the coastline list
I propose if this administration wants oil rigs on coastline, build it right off @MirALargo & then talk to #US about this ridiculous!

7362 2018-03-09 22:13:48 The Fiscal Commission Working Group, including several acclaimed  international economists and Nobel Prize winning Economists, has recommended that an independent Scotland establish an oil fund. This fund will ensure that the proceeds of oil and gas can be invested in Scotland
7363 2018-03-09 22:13:39 Yes, but no direct mention of Energy Cost to Extract 1 unity of Oil.
7364 2018-03-09 22:13:39 Played your part the day pal. Still using cooking oil to style the hair?
7365 2018-03-09 22:13:28 Brought my car to get the oil changed. Two cars ahead of me. Three service workers. I'm told it will be an hour minimum. Hard to understand. I can change my oil in 15 minutes and I don't have all the fancy shit they have here.
7366 2018-03-09 22:13:21 Every time I get an oil change they always gotta make up stuff that’s wrong with my car
7367 2018-03-09 22:13:18 We already have an over abundance of oil, technology is making it less critical for our energy needs. That’s why it hasn’t been over $100/barrel in years. The North Dakota oil fields are essentially shut down because of so much supply in the market.
7368 2018-03-09 22:13:10 Olive oil is the original finesser. She had two dudes who would do anything for her.. and she alternated between using the two to do her bidding.

We have technology that can make Alberta Bitumen the lowest CO2 emissions oil in the world, by about 40% lless CO2 emissions.  Would you or someone you know be interested in helping us to market this itechnology.
7371 2018-03-09 22:12:41 According to Dr Alex Kemp of the University of Aberdeen, over 90% of total tax revenue from oil and gas is generated in Scottish waters. This is ensured by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

7373 2018-03-09 22:12:26 so i was watching this german youtuber showing her korean skin care routine and... she doesn't use a second cleanser after her oil... why sis that must leave so many makeup residues
7374 2018-03-09 22:12:13 So no to oil rigs but yes to windmills?
7375 2018-03-09 22:12:09 Exactly. The wife wanted something from the local fish fry today. Nasty oil. I'll stick to my T-bones, thank you very much.
7376 2018-03-09 22:11:56 Cambodia do not have much natural resources and abundant only land and forest. If some Countries have oil and gas. They use their natural resources for their development, Cambodia can too. We have also commune of highlanders and commune committee which are CPP members, not your!

7378 2018-03-09 22:11:53 My mother had seizures the last year of her life and medical marijuana (CBD oil) helped: lessen the frequency of & speed of recovery between them. So you can call it a gateway drug because it was a gateway to my mom having a better quality of life.

7380 2018-03-09 22:11:46 I could supply our nation with enough oil for 25 years with how oily my face is, just right now
7381 2018-03-09 22:11:46 Despite the scare stories, there are decades worth of North Sea oil available for extraction. The UK government concedes that oil has a future “well beyond 2055” (section 5)   Dr Richard Pike, a former oil industry consultant,  who predicts a future 100 years of North Sea oil.
7382 2018-03-09 22:11:35 We also dont see any Christians around but their houses do make nice abodes dont it. And the oil and gas aint bad either..
7383 2018-03-09 22:11:32 things I’d never thought I’d hear while going through border patrol/customs: “have you tried tea tree oil for your face?”
7384 2018-03-09 22:11:32 So, wind farms = bad, but oil rigs = good?  Okay, sure.

7390 2018-03-09 22:10:35 According to government valuations – based upon current and projected markets – this oil has a total wholesale value of at least £1.5 trillion. This is influenced by soaring global demand for energy. The UK government predicts a 28% rise in demand by 2035.

7400 2018-03-09 22:09:00 Scandalous it is !!! This countries greatest natural resource that will never run out if managed correctly unlike oil/gas...could provide thousands of jobs for our coastal towns

7410 2018-03-09 22:08:16 Do you reckon that doing business with ISIS, such as buying oil from them, sounds like supporting terrorism and it should be a punishable crime? It never fails to amaze me how pro Erdogan people always cant or dont want to see the elephant in the room...
7411 2018-03-09 22:08:14 But how it increasing and therefore encouraging the use of oil, especially the crap the comes out of AB fitting in with fighting climate change?

7413 2018-03-09 22:07:54 He doubled spending on clean energy research and was successful in helping cut our dependence on foreign oil/natural resources. His administration helped protect over 260 million acres of Americas public lands and water..more than ANY other President in history.
7414 2018-03-09 22:07:51 Why should we thank them!, they been screwing over the non OPEC world oil market for 35 years
7415 2018-03-09 22:07:21 I think its just plain old commodity cycle driven. Low prices curing low prices. Peak cheap gold/oil maybe.
7416 2018-03-09 22:07:19 Oil spills in the north east waters could ultimately harm Canadian waters as well as the south east to. #BlueWaterHorizon harmed La, Ms & Al. Stop it from happening up there.
7417 2018-03-09 22:07:09 Getting my oil changed and the three people in front of me were all told that they needed transmission flushes. Then, sure enough, turns out I *needed* one, too. 

Seems...convenient.
7418 2018-03-09 22:07:06 Says the guy calling Albertans “greedy oil shills”. Look man you wanna debate who’s a meanie head you do that. All I’m saying is you wanna go fossil fuel free? Good for you. I’d give you three days before you’d come crying and begging to have it back. You need Kinder Morgan too
7419 2018-03-09 22:07:05 A little dog and a big old, well, we will choose our words wisely. Cats and kittens, mittens and gloves, if they don't fit, acquit. The bit and drilling for oil deep sea, y dew those movies seem like props agenda. Man a tea and mat in May I mother. Goose and duck goes quack.
7420 2018-03-09 22:07:01 As long as oil stays below $75/barrel it won’t be worth the cost of building extremely expensive oil rigs.
That’s why we all need to keep supporting clean energy even if the costs will rise because of this Trump douche and his ludicrous energy policies!

7422 2018-03-09 22:06:27 Ah. So from 1975 to 2017, the oil companies have not been successful at extracting oil. Did you know the Scottish Government wants to stop using fossil fuels by 2030?
7423 2018-03-09 22:06:10 Yeah yeah yeah until someone lines your pockets like your BIG OIL donors did. YOU’RE WORD IS MEANINGLESS!  #TaxScamBill
7424 2018-03-09 22:06:10 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
7425 2018-03-09 22:05:49 Big oil rigs are fine, he's just against all those ugly windmills that produce clean energy.

7431 2018-03-09 22:05:19 It is also incorrect to call this an “Oil and Gas LEASING program”:
The oil and gas extracted is not returned after the leasing period ends!

7438 2018-03-09 22:04:14 Went to dealership #1, change the oil every 3750 miles, dealer #2, 5000 miles.

Hmm

Who do you trust? 

Cars... This place has nice seats 4 TV... Everyone on a phone. 

How does anyone meet or interact anymore? 12 ppl mom and kid, all on phones.
7439 2018-03-09 22:03:59 Over an hour for an oil change... it’s like they know I have shit I need to get done
7440 2018-03-09 22:03:53 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
7441 2018-03-09 22:03:36 Like black tar oil w green slime eyes of coal they change once get wicked
7442 2018-03-09 22:03:29 Who said THAT ?? ... not me, Bruce you are making this up ..... but after Indy scotland will start an oil fund, we have at least 100 years of oil left, so better late than never
7443 2018-03-09 22:03:10 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-03-09, is 6.88.

7445 2018-03-09 22:02:58 So you want Scotland to build a $1Tr oil fund from what is left today? From the secret fields in the Clyde?

7450 2018-03-09 22:02:31 Our current wars aren't fought "for oil", but so elites in Govts and "Defense" industries can loot and control us.

7456 2018-03-09 22:01:42 I'm the only person I know who has accidentally dumped a quart of oil on their phone
7457 2018-03-09 22:01:37 Adhering to one's principles is important, but what to do when those principles conflict? Being vegan and avoiding products with palm oil are two tough yet ultimately compatible imperatives - but how can they be reconciled with my principle of eating delicious cookies every day?
7458 2018-03-09 22:01:18 Using the pipeline as an exchange for Alberta agreeing to a federally implemented carbon tax makes no sense. AB is using stromg-arm tactics to try to get the oil industry back where it once was. They need to invest in cleaner options and get on board with fighting climate change

7460 2018-03-09 22:00:57 Western countries colonize, dig for oil everywhere, destroy cultures and environments even to this day, and at the same time hypocritically have a conscience with this.
7461 2018-03-09 22:00:54 Let's ask Obama to help with the negotiating of oil for your country, he gets along with them & that will help your country finances... I will write to Obama,  maybe you can take me to visit my fathers' family (Politics); My father Fidel Castro.

7466 2018-03-09 22:00:23 If we don't deal with climate change, it's also going to have tremendous impact on wildlife and ecology - in the long run, it's a far greater threat to them than an oil spill.

7482 2018-03-09 21:58:44 Hey, I know you are busy...but could you do something about the gas companies crippling the average American? Oil at an all time low, yet national average for gasoline is still over $2/gallon. Help please @realDonaldTrump
7483 2018-03-09 21:58:22 Fair comment - for me, climate change is the highest priority, because it's a threat that's both extraordinarily dangerous (the 2003 European heat wave killed 70,000 people) and extraordinarily difficult to deal with. Oil spills are serious, but at least we know what to do.

7486 2018-03-09 21:57:59 They did not have that problem last year. I don’t understand why and how this came about. More power and less oil burning or why. Anyone has a bit more info than just guessing i am all ears.
7487 2018-03-09 21:57:34 It’s tradition to change the oil, wash, vacuum and quick wax any vehicle I’m fixing to drive on vacation.

7494 2018-03-09 21:56:46 It's a heavily subsidised sector with tight margins and a poor environmental record. Rather than swallowing the Going for Growth snouts-in-the-trough snake oil we should be winding down agricultural production to sustainable levels

7504 2018-03-09 21:55:29 Obama also put harsher sanctions on Russia when they broke international law. But that hurt poor Exxon+Putins wittle feelings bc it f'd up a multi million $ oil deal. Which is why Russia retaliated with cyber attacks 
7505 2018-03-09 21:55:17 Giving Alfie the oil would save NHS in the region of £100,000 a year, Alfie his life and Hannah a lot of stress. I stopped chemotherapy in 2013 and tried the oil, saved them thousands and I never died which was the prognosis with Chemotherapy. This should be a “no brainer “

7509 2018-03-09 21:55:02 Very serious. And if you look at it, you'll see that there is no resource control is behind the rise in this practice. The entire illegal oil bunkering and refining.

7513 2018-03-09 21:54:48 Sweet! The same locations we already have Chinese and Russian oil companies drilling. Great, glad we aren’t banned by Obama anymore to compete.
7514 2018-03-09 21:54:48 Canada's govt doesn't spend a single dollar promoting renewable energy. It does however approve oil pipelines and forces provinces to accept them against their safety concerns
7515 2018-03-09 21:54:39 That's interesting, I wonder why that is. I know homes here use gas too, but oil is very common. I'll have to do some reading on it too, now I'm intrigued.

7518 2018-03-09 21:53:53 Wow we take for granted shampoo and conditioner to make our hair nice, olive oil is too greasy coconut oil in your food gives your hair a shine, thy head and shoulders, go for a silk look 
 Not a crude oil look !
7519 2018-03-09 21:53:48 Okay I apparently have not baked a cake in forever. What kind of oil do you use? It's not vegetable oil, is it?
7520 2018-03-09 21:53:37 Unless everyone stops consuming, we will always need oil. It’s just easier for you to stomach when you don’t have to see where it comes from.
7521 2018-03-09 21:53:37 Oregon has Ocean earthquake fault lines. Not a good place for oil drilling.
7522 2018-03-09 21:53:33 Virgin olive oil comes from???

7538 2018-03-09 21:50:43 They all think Scotland contributes more than is declared, because Norway and oil and whiskey and stuff.
7539 2018-03-09 21:50:40 Does that mean the EU is going to drop all import tariffs? Those on wine, olive oil, ground coffee, Chinese steel, food from Africa, shoes from China?

7551 2018-03-09 21:48:27 Found some sources that are probably biased, but it sounds like oil actually has some interesting advantages. But less than 0.3% of CA households heat with oil so that's why I wasn't familiar with it.
7552 2018-03-09 21:48:26 Will do .....every day is a new DAY with great dispensaries in walking distance.... caviar, Distillate, hash, keif, drinks, oil, and loads of strains of flower...& stuff I overlooked 4 sure

7554 2018-03-09 21:48:18 Probably a sketchy CBD company - the industry is full of them. If you want to give legit CBD oil another shot, I'd love to send you some samples from @SabaiDeeCBD  - a transparent company dedicated to quality and giving back.

7589 2018-03-09 21:44:12 I agree whole heartily about that. However, these corporations will never do that. If we were talking about a Nationally Run energy program then maybe it would happen, much in the way Norway operates. But privately run foreign oil corporations care only about profits.

The petroleum (oil/gas) lobby is very powerful, but not as powerful if we ALL stand up. Now, the petroleum lobby is trying to stop restaurants from using less straws in Cali. #resist
7720 2018-03-09 21:29:37 We don't mine steel in this state... we buy it.  We don't mine or use coal in this state.  We have a larger hydroelectric program than we do a natural gas drilling program, and we don't drill for oil. Nobody here is excited about Trump's policies. #FuckTheRustBelt
7721 2018-03-09 21:29:31 no it doesn't

Maybe a 1p difference but 9p is profiteering

9p a litre is hundreds of pounds per barrel of crude oil

7723 2018-03-09 21:28:57 @RachelNotley How terrible it is to ignore the global climate crisis as a you advocate for big oil.  Talk about fiddling while Rome burns.  Are the futures of our grandchildren really worth sacrificing so you can win an election?  Such terrible leadership!

7727 2018-03-09 21:28:21 If I didn't have to go home and clean up oil I would've stayed today to get overtime
7728 2018-03-09 21:28:14 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SecretarySonny @WhiteHouse @EPAScottPruitt    What is imported oil cost in American lives?   #RFSWorks #DontMessWithTheRFS
7729 2018-03-09 21:28:12 You can do so many things with kale! Smoothies and soups are two possibilities but why not ry it in a frying pan with garlic, some olive oil and a lid? Leave it on a low heat for 10-15 mins and enjoy it with your main course! And if you fancy giving it some kick, add chilli, too.
7730 2018-03-09 21:27:55 why wait until people are dead think of how much bone oil is just walking around not powering shit
7731 2018-03-09 21:27:55 Nehru was k or in a 5 star jail on and off with all the luxury to write a book. Savarkar was pulling oil mill for 10 years continuously while sleeping is a tiny cubicle on a rough floor.

It was in the ScotGov report you referred me to. 
Quoted ‘90% of Oil Revenues’.
Are you saying ScotGov are lying in the report?
7745 2018-03-09 21:25:48 Would they let the amazon grow back? Or grow palm oil to earn a crust, neither argument is correct. The answer is in the middle eat less meat yes but don't think eradicating domestic farm animals is any kind of veggie heaven either
7746 2018-03-09 21:25:38 I shaved, then used Veet hair removal cream, sogqiba uthambise icoconut oil
7747 2018-03-09 21:25:35 Managed to have something healthy for tea without too much fuss from C: did him parsley butter fish with coconut rice then used the leftover butter sauce to oil my pan and do chilli and lime for me with lots of salad. Only an extra 3-4 mins cooking time and 2 happy campers.
7748 2018-03-09 21:25:18 Not us. We have our own oil
7749 2018-03-09 21:25:13 oh i am expecting major flop.... like.. BP oil spill Flop....
7750 2018-03-09 21:25:04 Hey uh, @RachelNotley ... you realize the majority of the people who work your oil sands and fields LIVE in BC, right?  You're effectively going to punish your own work force - good job, I see why they want you out of government.

7755 2018-03-09 21:24:15 My husband had oil company issues since it is owned with his family. But I nearly didn't get married over it. LOL. I was not warned I would be presented with legal paperwork of this fashion. In the end, I don't really care. But I do recall the fidelity thing I think.
7756 2018-03-09 21:24:09 I put a little bit of Tea Tree essential oil inside the toilet paper roll, so every time it spins, it releases more of the smell. Jericho freaked out like I was a mage because suddenly it always smells lovely. Hahaha

7760 2018-03-09 21:24:00 My only issue with Tristan’s take is the idea that crude oil exports only benefit Alberta. In fact, as eminent economist Patricia Mohr has often stated, they are what “pay the rent” for Canada. To overlook this is to miss the whole point of engaging in trade.
7761 2018-03-09 21:23:56 does castor oil truly work for lashes or is that a myth
7762 2018-03-09 21:23:21 @kerenswan i always use peppermint essential oil on my temples and back of my neck.
7763 2018-03-09 21:23:11 What, moonrocks? - Dank-ass weed nug dipped in hash oil then dipped in keif. As far as I know. Could be different in other locations.
7764 2018-03-09 21:23:02 Singapore’s net exports are 25% of the GDP current account surplus and that’s discussing the economy. We can never be Singapore for a plethora of reasons but mostly because the world’s oil passes through the Straits of Malcca which SG commands.
7765 2018-03-09 21:23:01 I was saddened to hear of the passing of Alirio Parra, a friend and a historic figure of the oil industry. Our condolences go to his family and friends.

7768 2018-03-09 21:22:21 So... my bottle of hair oil was almost out, I mixed water with it thinking I could get more oil out of the bottle. How simple are you?

Does govt have responsibility to provide citizens with crude oil or any mineral ?....if people are not making profits from “extracting” water, why should they pay govt for  it?

7825 2018-03-09 21:14:02 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.
7826 2018-03-09 21:13:59 How long should an oil change take?
7827 2018-03-09 21:13:57 I suggest you to do other kinds of shows, such as: oil, blowjob, shower
7828 2018-03-09 21:13:37 One of these statements is carefully phrased to be consistent with evidence and logic. One is sensationalist snake oil. Can you spot the difference?
7829 2018-03-09 21:13:34 I had an appointment at Jansens at 2 for an oil change. I’ve been here since 1:45 and they still have my car. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE.
7830 2018-03-09 21:13:29 Naa this is just like water and oil it dont mix
7831 2018-03-09 21:13:17 When you are increasing oil tanker shipments from 5 per month to 30, for starters you are clearly increasing the risk something is going to happen and with spawning steams, pacific salmon populations and the Southern Resident Orca numbers so low, one spill could wipe them out.
7832 2018-03-09 21:13:11 Me: I’m going to the dealer to get an oil change.

Meanwhile the world needs more Canadian oil for now and into the future, and to relieve the pressure on rail transport and protect environment we need pipeline. Don’t bait and switch.

7860 2018-03-09 21:09:15 Forgive me, but is that picture real.  I am no oil painting myself, but it looks like a Cameron/Thatcher clone, mind I cannot see any Blair in it.
7861 2018-03-09 21:09:14 Ford just paid for my oil change and a free car wash...god bless
7862 2018-03-09 21:09:03 It never fails for me to get ashy again. Coconut oil just isn’t for me

7868 2018-03-09 21:08:31 I just dropped some coconut oil on the kitchen floor and now it’s slippery and all I can think of is the “come get y’all juice” vine.
7869 2018-03-09 21:08:28 I don't take as long in the shower as I used to...hopefully less water use means less energy needed to heat it. I don't buy products with palm oil.
7870 2018-03-09 21:08:20 Smart and associating with Barack Obama is like saying oil and water mix well together. This woman @sam_vinograd doesn't have a clue. She was merely gossiping on OutFront with Erin Burnett.

7873 2018-03-09 21:07:46 My Dear Flaps
Russia could have executed this chap anytime on their own turf
but instead they set him free in a trade off deal,
to live in UK
Is Russia happy to see UK leaving EU
yes
Russia has no reason to pour oil on UK's already troubled waters
UK GOV are taking right approach
7874 2018-03-09 21:07:30 Like every other nation in the world - economic management including deficit and debt control. Oh except Norway same size as Scotland - less oil - extremely rich. Wonder what dead weight they didn’t have . A clue

7876 2018-03-09 21:06:44 Venezuela would be much better off if left alone to figure out how to solve their own problems. A phony economy based on drilling for oil run by foreigners is of no benefit at all to the Venezuelan people in the long run.
7877 2018-03-09 21:06:43 i heard the new tatcha primer is rly good too for oily skin?! i dunno if u can get tatcha there tho... also i find that the biore perfect face milk uv (a sunscreen) helps control oil a lot too :0
7878 2018-03-09 21:06:37 Trump accused China of delivering oil to NK while it was Russia. The intelligence of Putin and Jong-Un is far greater than Trumps. HandsDown

7887 2018-03-09 21:04:48 Next time a telco exec talks about their fears of being a "dumb pipe", ask them if they know the typical P/E ratio for an oil pipeline company, and whether they think their investors would be pleased with it...

7892 2018-03-09 21:04:11 It can easily flake if you use it with a certain type of oil or curling cream
7893 2018-03-09 21:04:06 Yeah but if we block them from exporting it what are they gonna do? They can’t eat oil, Pete
7894 2018-03-09 21:04:00 Let’s hope he never finds out proof of stake in oil doesn’t work. You have to get the stuff out of the ground for it to be useable. And he should never use a phone because it represents the work he hates so much.
7895 2018-03-09 21:03:50 You can buy fake tails for cows! When I used to show jerseys we put glitter spray on them, black hoof oil, hairspray... they had to look their best!
7896 2018-03-09 21:03:37 your members are really understanding and I imagine if you temporarily switched to doing more tease, oil play, bondage, etc etc--it will not only change things up--but may also, in the end get you going because you know you don't HAVE TO get off.
7897 2018-03-09 21:03:37 90% of the NHS is used by 90% of the population - which is England! Our NHS is not in crisis because it’s properly funded by our oil revenue and whisky bond and energy and salmon and tourism ... etc etc etc
7898 2018-03-09 21:03:22 Didn’t know I was paying for my dad’s oil change...

7900 2018-03-09 21:03:00 You know the country is for all intensive purposes a dictatorship right, and yes I will blame it on the awful management of the government in question, a country with the oil reserves of Venezuela should be able to survive that if they know how to manage an economy
7901 2018-03-09 21:02:42 Have you tried boiling the cat in oil until the claws are soft?
7902 2018-03-09 21:02:33 Yemen is now an Erik Prince, Trump, Putin, business project. It is not about Iran, Houthis or geopolitics. Those kleptocrats will divide Yemen & bring in Russia for oil contracts. Isn't it all about the billions those greedy individuals can steal, while using state power.
7903 2018-03-09 21:02:31 Notley is an absolute savage for threatening cutting oil and gas to BC if our pipeline is not accepted. Is this legal? Will I be eating steak sandwiches 3 meals a day come summer time? Travel to Dawson for fruits and vedgies? #NoFucksGivenNotley
7904 2018-03-09 21:02:24 your version of "democrats" are a bunch of out of touch dinosaurs that take payoffs from wall st., the oil lobby and the military industry. we don't need them, or you anymore.

7916 2018-03-09 21:01:02 @BlissNutButters   The lack of palm oil in your products should b highly publicized.

7931 2018-03-09 20:59:19 My brother literally almost killed us both by forgeting oil in the oven for too long. I was in my room and something started to smell funny, when I opened the door, my corridor was taken by smoke. 
When I arrived in the kitchen I almost passed out in the spot.
7932 2018-03-09 20:59:17 I would expect nothing less. Don't forget the beard oil

7952 2018-03-09 20:56:55 All of them have socialist qualities and regulated capitalism. In Norway, for example, the state owns or tightly regulates the oil industry, places profits in a sovereign fund and uses the money to fund public benefits. Classic socialism. Others similar.

7994 2018-03-09 20:51:52 Sanctions and military threat are the only reasons people can point to for what would appear to be an unlikely 360 degree change of NK stance in a few months. They aren't wallproofed.There have been several reports recently of North Korean oil smuggling to get around sanctions.
7995 2018-03-09 20:51:44 What are the chances of the age restriction part of this bill getting struck down in Fed Court!?
7996 2018-03-09 20:51:42 I use peppermint oil for nausea and to relax muscles. Lavendar is supposed to be calming, but I'm allergic, so the smell drives nuts. Is ignoring her an option? Because often when people are causing drama, they NEED an audience. Remove your attention and they often go elsewhere.

8003 2018-03-09 20:51:08 Supposedly equivalent? From a calorie point of view, 'healthy' fats are still very high.

If you drenched every meal in olive oil and were trying to lose weight you wouldn't be making it easier for yourself.
8004 2018-03-09 20:51:05 Make your cupcakes with applesauce instead of vegetable oil. Thank me later
8005 2018-03-09 20:50:35 Trump supporters are so blinded by this snake oil salesman they won’t even ask the pertinent questions regarding his obvious hypocrisy. Ask him why he and Ivanka shipped jobs overseas and have yet to bring them back to America!
8006 2018-03-09 20:50:32 You can make a simple but delicious dip with white beans, dill, olive oil, salt and some water to thin it out. Blend it up in a food processor & serve with fresh cut carrots, cucumbers, peppers, etc
8007 2018-03-09 20:50:25 Anyone know where I can get a thc oil cartridge 
8008 2018-03-09 20:50:24 It's only a big deal because you are not aware he offered the same to Clinton during his Presidency. Besides, Putin have a lot to do with it. He needs to sell his oil/gas among other things. NK is in need.

8012 2018-03-09 20:50:18 The Bayou Bridge Pipeline is the next big pipeline fight. Energy Transfer Partners (the same company behind #DAPL) is building a crude oil pipeline through Louisiana wetlands, and has spied on the protestors protecting the ecosystem, with the help of the Louisiana government.

8017 2018-03-09 20:50:09 If you believe that the oil industry gives a rats ass about anything other than profit you're a fool. Almost 70% of corp tax cuts have gone to stock buy back which makes CEO richer. The couldn't care less about a family in Bethel.#VoteThemOut2018

8026 2018-03-09 20:48:46 you eat it, make sure it's the pure stuff not mixed in too much honey or anything. and evening primrose oil is amazing, get something high quality.
8027 2018-03-09 20:48:45 Na I haven't. He's a snake oil salesman. Takes advantage of people at their lowest. Charges $2,000 for one of his 'seminars'. A total crook. Have you watched the video I shared?
8028 2018-03-09 20:48:37 When people ask me what I do, I say: "I do financial administration for an independent used oil company," because actually explaining my job will take daaaays. So I just say that and even then it's confusing.
8029 2018-03-09 20:48:29 Yes, but the trade off is when international men's day arrives and his car needs an oil change...
8030 2018-03-09 20:48:22 theyre so pretty they have an oil paintjng quality to them
8031 2018-03-09 20:48:20 Whether you blend oil and  vinegar,  stir it, or  shake it, they don't mix. They always separate. Democracy and Fascism do not mix. Trump may want a fascist regime, but true blue Americans don't. The world is trying to figure out how to survive post radiated America.

8033 2018-03-09 20:47:55 I think he is a FAILURE,  self serving , nra flunky. Thrilled with trophy hunters, & gives away unbelievable historical land to oil and gas. In no way is he an asset to our country.

8037 2018-03-09 20:47:39 We're sitting on huge oil reserves that will be useless once other energy resources are implemented. I say bring down the price of fuel in USA by 75%  while we develop alternative sources! Creates jobs too. That's a big raise for every driving American!
8038 2018-03-09 20:47:36 I just took a shower, watched the latest Junji Ito episode with the stupid oil story, and now want to take another shower. Even when poorly animated, that one makes my skin crawl.
8039 2018-03-09 20:47:35 I’m not too informed about the issue but not sure why we need an expansion when oil prices are down? Isn’t the current pipeline good enough?
8040 2018-03-09 20:47:31 Looks like a beautiful oil portrait!
8041 2018-03-09 20:47:30 But, I *like* changing my oil!

8044 2018-03-09 20:46:44 There are cycles, we're do for a recession. Heavy, indiscriminate tariffs always a horrendous idea (protectionism generally) but especially so at this juncture. Cut in legal immigration also veery problematic.
8045 2018-03-09 20:46:40 I Hate Coming To Get My Oil Cahnged Because They Take FOREVER 
8046 2018-03-09 20:46:40 i usually choose to eat a healthier meal at home but days that i’m feeling physically fatigued or if i’m depressed i’ll have a bowl of rice + coconut oil + some leftover or frozen steamable veggies. if that’s too much, chips and hummus. at worst: 1/2-whole bag of tortilla chips
8047 2018-03-09 20:46:32 When the sunlight hits the olive oil, don't hesitate...
8048 2018-03-09 20:46:22 Everyone thought it would be hard to start the process of quitting oil. Would it ever happen? Thank you Notley! You just made it easier. Money will be lost at first but new startups and green tech will replace it. EU already has great tech to license

8052 2018-03-09 20:45:55 Looks like Alberta is determined to cut off oil to B.C. I live in Alberta (40 yrs), have a daughter and grandson both born here, but I was born in B.C. Didn't think it mattered, it is all part of Canada. Lets try and remember we are Canadians first

8054 2018-03-09 20:45:31 "To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified." ~Isaiah ch61.v3
8055 2018-03-09 20:45:26 How do you feel about oil blotting sheets?
8056 2018-03-09 20:45:17 For sure, but doesn't capture the gap in potential production because of access to water for shale development in particular. But yeah, people forget that China was an  oil exporter from about 65' to 91'
8057 2018-03-09 20:45:15 That's a fair assessment. They better start tanking correctly they always strike oil when they get that #1 spot might be the only way out lol
8058 2018-03-09 20:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

8060 2018-03-09 20:44:54 2/2 Maybe he believes it is a small investment to make until he can put things in place to make the U.S. energy self sufficient.  Oil that is. Black Gold. Texas Tea.

-make the earth move like it's listening to it's favorite song
-pay my bills
-ride my jet ski
-create jobs cleaning spills
-create beautiful city fog
-help @ScottPruittOK fly first class

8125 2018-03-09 20:37:07 I was thinking of just buying gold and shoving it in a safety deposit box. A gold & diamond dealer owes me a favor so I would be looked after but I don't see much upside. I think OPEC will squeeze oil higher but u can't buy it for cash! Is it bad that I want a recession?

8129 2018-03-09 20:36:25 The lie is that it's not just oil.... it's land.. it's some organic new grain we want to consume massively like Quinoa.. it's a rare plant that cures some disease.. it's trees.. it's anything we can commoditize..

the lie is thinking it's just oil that tempts us to destroy things

8133 2018-03-09 20:36:06 China is one of the world's largest oil producers!
8134 2018-03-09 20:36:04 If @Interior intends to live up to its bio on its Twitter page, the idea of oil/gas drilling off FL's Atlantic coast will be treated like the insanity it is & shelved. It also threatens our national security by potentially crippling myriad economic sources with 1 spill.
8135 2018-03-09 20:36:01 It’s steamed and then tossed in the bacon oil like the mammy used to do it.
8136 2018-03-09 20:35:45 I get that but the oil industry has provided Canada and our citizens with tremendous prosperity. So for a lot of ppl, it feels like Nye and others are trashing us directly when they choose to use their opportunities here to take aim at the economic engine of our country
8137 2018-03-09 20:35:45 I honestly add drops of the oil to flavored water
8138 2018-03-09 20:35:42 They sent me a recipe. Basically fill a jar with leaf & bud of the type you want, cover with organic olive oil in boiling water bath for 2 hours. Preserves the healing properties bc it does not get too hot to destroy them.
8139 2018-03-09 20:35:37 Lmaoo oh well I gotta get it done smh the oil flush was the most expensive part smh

8145 2018-03-09 20:35:09 One thing I didn't read was a disclaimer that Murphy is paid by the oil industry. Woudn't want your readers to think he's unbiased.
8146 2018-03-09 20:35:07 Oh, that Black seed oil somethin’ serious.
8147 2018-03-09 20:35:05 fuck it another recipe

KingRui's Greasy Faggot Sticks aka fries

thanks for the name @Spooky_Wifi

ingredients:

olive oil (apparently peanut oil is amazing for chips so maybe use that)

baking potatoes

salt, pepper, paprika (and a strange little red japanese spice-
8148 2018-03-09 20:35:03 Nothing wrong with not being oil dependent on the Middle East while we're working on alternative energy sources

8153 2018-03-09 20:34:33 We will be better off on our own we have loads of riches without the oil that's a bonus. Did you know we supply the north of England with electric and water. We are a rich nation and would be even richer when we stop sending our tax revenues to westminster

8158 2018-03-09 20:33:44 But first, Sarah has to change your oil.
8159 2018-03-09 20:33:36 So good on little buttered baby potatoes. Thin-sliced cucumbers with dill, vinegar, a little sugar, salt, let rest for a while to meld. Mix w/blended silken tofu, lemon, etc to dip chips or veg. Steep in jojoba oil, dab on pulse points, smell like a pickle, set mouths watering.
8160 2018-03-09 20:33:19 I beat a egg & milk together then added flour. I had another dry mix of flour, pepper and slapyamama.

Dipped them in the wet mix then dry
& dropped them in hot oil.

The taste reminded me of fried chicken which is what I was going for

Hope that wasn't too detailed lol
8161 2018-03-09 20:33:12 They want Texans to hand over their guns and shut down oil? Good luck with that agenda.

8176 2018-03-09 20:30:38 I bought 1000 shares of the stock at $55 and figured it will pay my $10 per month fee for the next 3-4 generations of my family.  So far so good.  Maybe I will do same thing with oil

8179 2018-03-09 20:30:18 I'd love to be able to ask the decision makers of the past, but my hunch is the transition from coal -> heating oil -> natural gas had something to do with convenience, efficiency & cost. But if anything, each transition took a new way of thinking!
8180 2018-03-09 20:30:02 i love myself wow i smell like coco butter and shea butter mixed with argan oil thank you @TheBodyShop
8181 2018-03-09 20:29:50 You may be right about untapped oil reserves in Afghan being a consideration, if not the cause, but I read somewhere that 50% of Afghan’s GDP comes from opium - probably more a case of the CIA wanting to control the global opiate trade...
8182 2018-03-09 20:29:31 thank goodness i got my oil changed today, i was ab 20 miles from blowing up
8183 2018-03-09 20:29:14 How would you like a Saudi Oil baron coming to your country telling you to act on climate change? Kind of the same thing, just dressed up better and more white
8184 2018-03-09 20:28:56 Me, dropping my car off for an oil change: Yeah, and make sure the tech doesn't have allergies.  There's a shit-ton of peanut butter in there.

8186 2018-03-09 20:28:43 The guy doing an oil change on my boyfriend's truck just called him "boss" 21 times in 3 minutes. I'm so fascinated by how men address men.  I'm going to start calling every woman I interact with "boss lady."

8191 2018-03-09 20:28:27 Initially oil palm is a supplement/alternative to rubber on new land. Sometimes interplanted, ready to kill whichever has lowest price in 5 years. Rubber prices very volatile pre-1914, and again in mid-1920s. Post-1960 oil palm expansion is different - more state actors

8196 2018-03-09 20:27:41 So far, CBD oil makes me super mentally relaxed to the point of feeling groggy. As far as a work enhancing nootropic, it's a definite no for me. Lets me sleep like a rock though & could be good if I'm trying to chill out.
8197 2018-03-09 20:27:31 And the pay off for Sweden's government is how much again, Swed's sell grandma for how much and ship her c.o.d. Big pockets filled with oil money.

She thinks large parts of our forests and lands aren’t being used. They’re OUR LANDS, what’s with this unilateral decision making? Authoritarian?
8201 2018-03-09 20:27:00 The Turks are draining the eastern desert and the oil fields...
8202 2018-03-09 20:26:58 The worst part of being sick is having to throw out my hippie ways. Sick day one: I’ll just wear this diffuser necklace with thieves oil, drink lots of orange juice, and think positive thoughts. Sick day three: doing shots of DayQuil.
8203 2018-03-09 20:26:33 Bros, the past Government witnessed the biggest oil boom Nigeria had, yet our Reserve was drained.
With all the money we couldn't diversify.
It was also then Jamb was remitting 3 to 5million yearly. Imagine how much we could have saved if we have had 7billion yearly

8208 2018-03-09 20:25:48 Just heard a guy say “I need to buy beard oil” and now I can’t eat.
8209 2018-03-09 20:25:47 You’re right. Residents of WV don’t need more taxes; however, out-of-state oil and gas companies who take WV’s natural resources do.
8210 2018-03-09 20:25:23 love when the guys at jiffy lube explain a basic oil change to me slowly bc I’m obviously a dumb woman who knows nothing!!!!
8211 2018-03-09 20:25:23 Conditioner, water and oil does amazingly at detangling 
8212 2018-03-09 20:24:52 How does it match up vs standard oil or railroad barons of yore?
8213 2018-03-09 20:24:48 Massaged some castor oil into my hair. Man that felt like everything
8214 2018-03-09 20:24:28 So if I got this right, there was a shift from oil palms to rubber (which maybe was associated with war needs?). Did they shift back at some point (which is why we always hear about the env problems with palm oil plantations in SE Asia now)?

8216 2018-03-09 20:24:23 It’s only taken me a day in a half to finish a bag of potstickers because I keep telling myself they’re healthy as long as I fry them in olive oil
8217 2018-03-09 20:24:22 Why are you screaming about oil?
8218 2018-03-09 20:23:46 yes and no - early oil palm is on "virgin forest" (problematic term, but still...). Post-1950, there is major interest in planting on old rubber land, which does mirror Caribbean case better. Introduction of Afr. weevil is, (apparently, surprisingly!) helpful and harmless.
8219 2018-03-09 20:23:42 The rest of the country will outright sell non oil producing parts of Texas to Mexico with an “earnout” for the remainder.
8220 2018-03-09 20:23:37 When the truck comes to pick up the oil from the west, one scarred hand to the African American communities and people?
8221 2018-03-09 20:23:15 Cool, I can finally dump all these old paint cans and jugs of used motor oil down the storm sewer!
8222 2018-03-09 20:23:14 Oil is where you fix the world. Remove it. Afghanistan war was about oil. I'm sure the wars in the UAE are more than likely about oil. Remove the need for oil then there is nothing to gain. And the companies are scared now because we have a viable alternative.
8223 2018-03-09 20:22:45 Gasoline does everything you need. It’s an essential oil because it literally lowers things, I’ve never someone upset when they light fires, and gasoline actually produces heat
8224 2018-03-09 20:22:38 Many. A lot of it would be the Robert C. Atkins Foundation, Atkins Nutritionals, Virta, Keto supplement companies or those who sell books, Palm Oil Boards, etc. Sometimes the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Dairy Council, etc.
8225 2018-03-09 20:22:28 sweet almond oil and cucumbers. They did absolutely nothing lol. I tried potatoes for like two days.
8226 2018-03-09 20:22:17 @koolisamwel Oil and Gas is a new development in Kenya and more specifically to Turkana  pastoral  community. Our environment and health are paramount. As present generation let us prepare for a safe landing for our future generations. We meet there guys!

8229 2018-03-09 20:21:55 Two weeks ago, a friend’s (an MD) daughter, after 3 unsuccessful back operations could not sleep despite pain meds. The mother bought some CBD oil in desperation. First night without pain in weeks. Taken orally—there is no THC (the high) in it. Everyone was surprised. Who knows?

8242 2018-03-09 20:20:09 That’s a lot of Palm oil
8243 2018-03-09 20:20:04 We currently tax oil production at a ridiculously low rate. It's around 2% for the first 36 months. If we raised that to the average of neighboring states we'd make literally hundreds of millions more dollars per year

8247 2018-03-09 20:19:32 She could reduce production across the board, which will indiscriminately reduce our oil products shipments to energy markets across NorthAmerica & the world...which will hurt our own oil&gas industry & slash our provincial revenues much more without targeted effect we want on BC

The TLC Framboos Night serum is really great but also very expensive.

8288 2018-03-09 20:13:40 Ooph. That’s not great. We were at Formby - it was warm enough, we’re northern - and they’ve had a palm oil spillage on the beach, so we had to stay in the dunes in case he ate some. He loses his mind entirely in the sea as a rule, though.

8302 2018-03-09 20:11:10 Gummy bears have mineral oil listed as an ingredient. It's applied to the surface and tumbled in order to create shine/gloss.
8303 2018-03-09 20:11:03 Good point that I didn't even mention in the rant. With oil and natural gas doing well (booming in some cases), investment in education is ripe. Instead we get rot. Thanks.
8304 2018-03-09 20:11:03 I do it with olive oil at a push, so. It should be ok I suppose.

8328 2018-03-09 20:07:54 #kindermorgan Notley can't ask private companies to shut down $150 million/month in business for a legal spat with BC. So pipelines are private. The oil companies are private. The gas stations are private. It's a hollow threat.

8340 2018-03-09 20:04:29 off topic but, I have done a lot of research on using oil due to family illness & got in touch with a team of Italian/ Netherland docs who sent me their research papers. Much of what is sold online, including RS oil tested toxic with traces of Acetone, & other serious issues.

8343 2018-03-09 20:03:59 This is the sad reality.Nigeria went into recession because oil prices dropped internationally. Not because cattle could not graze, farmers could not farm, God was angry or people did not pay tax but bcos oil price dropped. Bayelsan suffered as Nigerians even though they are rich

8350 2018-03-09 20:02:49 @RepSchrader I see nothing wrong with exploring the coast for possibility of oil.  We need to know what resources will be available for the future.  We still buy 60% of our oil offshore.  Most of our electricity is produced by fossil fuels.  Its not free.

8411 2018-03-09 19:54:17 Just like here in Louisiana we are pumping from our golf natural gas and oil to the northern states and what kind transport tax do we get zero.. that is totally not right I could be an extreme revenue for Louisiana but they pay Louisiana nothing on transporting oil/gas
8412 2018-03-09 19:54:12 Everyday we be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say.
We be earnin' dollars turning 'cause we mind de pon we pay.

8413 2018-03-09 19:54:12 Cooking with coconut oil smells fresssshh
8414 2018-03-09 19:53:58 A dry oil is a moisturizing oil that does not make your skin oily or clog your pores! It does not dry you or oil you hence the +/- name. 
8415 2018-03-09 19:53:52 Overheard a waffle house cook "its the oil that makes the omelete rise".WOW, the oil is the anointing of His presence that raises our churches beyond just a service.
Pride is the enemy to worship.
8416 2018-03-09 19:53:42 a country that had once been one of the wealthiest Latin American countries, rich in oil reserves yet in total socioeconomic and political crisis....now is the problem truly Maduro's administration as most venezuelans claim? are continuous sanctions from US, Brazil the solution?
8417 2018-03-09 19:52:52 For 5 years, I lived in a flat, with no heating. And I mean none. Single glazed windows with rotten frames, had to clean the mould off the ceilings every spring, and had a plug in oil filled radiator. worked two jobs, sometimes over 80 hours a week, and even I knew I wasn't poor
8418 2018-03-09 19:52:51 The Scottish oil money, London fintech revs and Oxford/Cambridge Uni spin out taxes Newcastle gets in it's fiscal inflows isn't handouts...it's dues
Pooling and sharing....
8419 2018-03-09 19:52:48 Our boiler is now working. We won’t actually have heating until the oil arrives next week, though. Careless!
8420 2018-03-09 19:52:46 Coconut oil do the skin JUSTICE. 
8421 2018-03-09 19:52:36 I think less emphasis on the work & more on the gift would help her brand, especially when speaking to kids who don’t have oil blocks. Like you say, it’s relative. Hakeem Belo Osagie went to Oxford & Harvard but always says he was lucky. His pops was some 1st lady’s gynecologist
8422 2018-03-09 19:52:33 Yeah. That’s right. Revive the rust belt and oil and screw everyone else. We will move on WITHOUT YOU @realDonaldTrump

8424 2018-03-09 19:52:23 They have done things to fellow humans of terrible proportions for what? To make graveyards that they take earths oil , rather its blood , from those below us. Their literally grave robbers that we put as leaders.  One day their gonna regret how foolish they act.
8425 2018-03-09 19:52:12 Originally oil paints then reproduced and added to in digital.
8426 2018-03-09 19:52:05 She wont due that . Think about . Restrict the flow of Oil you restrict the flow of money. Alberta cant handle that now. BC will cave they have no choice and when they do cut their Royalties in half . A kick in balls is what they need

8430 2018-03-09 19:51:48 @realDonaldTrump is employing the strategic "Keep them guessing, with Oil of Olay" move, with Muppet Kim Jong Un; and yet, the fake news enemedia, GOPe, Democrats and the decomposing EU decided he was directing his anti-nuclear threats at them. STFU! This is stupid at its best.
8431 2018-03-09 19:51:28 Olive oil like say them wan fry you! 
8432 2018-03-09 19:51:23 Ah right. We treated Skye with CBD oil for her cancer.  I know you can get legal versions but I don't know how I'd stand with work as we have to have drug and alcohol tests x

8434 2018-03-09 19:50:58 you got on my ass and told me I didn't know shit simply because I prefer wax/oil over blunts, that convinced me you only smoke blunts this is the first I hear of you having pipes

8441 2018-03-09 19:50:17 Idk if you guys have sprouts, but they sell this peppermint essential oil stick. You rub it on your temples. I’ve had mirgrianes since I was 10 (22 now) and this works better than any medication
8442 2018-03-09 19:50:05 So just because they are incorporated makes them not criminals? Oil made petty tbugs billionaires...crime is crime regardless of your roots.

8451 2018-03-09 19:48:19 Huh???  Kinder Morgan doesn't operate any "open pit mines", or any other kind of mine, either.  They are not a mining company, nor are they an oil company.
8452 2018-03-09 19:48:19 The Competition Tribunal has approved with conditions a deal by Chinese state-owned oil company Sinopec to acquire a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa.

8454 2018-03-09 19:48:12 Customer service for the loss
8455 2018-03-09 19:47:51 Then they told us “ya sorry” and instead of price matching another pair of tickets that would have been like $150 to them they offered a $25 gift card. Like what a slap in the face
8456 2018-03-09 19:47:50 There is a place in SF with similar lines for fritters, Bob’s Doughnuts on Polk. I don’t think they’ve changed the oil in years, but man, it is dee-lic-ous.  #FatChat
8457 2018-03-09 19:47:50 i lost my oil pen i’m literally gonna lose my mind because i can’t remember if i took it out w me and it’s a lost cause or if it’s in my room somewhere
8458 2018-03-09 19:47:41 Presumably the #totp studio always had tons of sawdust available to absorb the oil that Simon Bates would leave behind.
8459 2018-03-09 19:47:33 They advertised tickets that were allegedly not available from the seller. We tried buying them online and we got errors. Called to buy them and were met with claims that the credit card was invalid, etc the tickets remained online for 30+ minutes while tadd was on the phone.

8461 2018-03-09 19:47:18 Oil price has doubled and Russia's GDP is up only 1.6%. It shows the incredible level of theft that Putin's circle has perpetrated on the country.
8462 2018-03-09 19:47:18 Crude oil futures are ending the week at $62.04/BBL Up $1.92 or 3.19%
The price of crude oil surged today on the back expectations of strong growth from a strong US economy. The futures contract is closing at $62.04. That is up $1.92 from yesterday's close or 3.19%.

8466 2018-03-09 19:46:48 He wasn't "awful," despite Reagan's constant script saying so. The Camp David Accords and the Department of Education were big, as was embracing human rights, decrying Middle East oil, and keeping arms from dictators. The hostage crisis was terrible, but Prez Carter wasn't.
8467 2018-03-09 19:46:40 Norway 2x as much oil as U.K. and a population the size of Scotland, there’s a thought. No wonder they’re not afraid. Oil Fund
8468 2018-03-09 19:46:36 Try 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, or 1/4 cup of applesauce. If it's a box cake, either one should be fine.

8474 2018-03-09 19:46:01 @BillKristol You must be livid that Trump's economic policies are working and that he has the guts to do what other tepid Republicans would not like: expand oil exploration, revise Dodd-Frank, defang the EPA, and now challenge the #ethanolmandate.
8475 2018-03-09 19:45:52 Can someone please tell me what coconut oil is actually used for
8476 2018-03-09 19:45:32 He dug the econ out of recession, slashed the deficit, took us out of Iraq, make us the largest oil producer, gave 39 million people health insurance, do u want more?

8485 2018-03-09 19:43:48 at some point, i'll stop to use perfumes and only rub on eucalyptus oil as it eases my breathing. it's so nostalgic, my mom used to 'drench' me in it as a baby.

8495 2018-03-09 19:42:46 Re-defining the Waters of the US to allow seismic testing and oil drilling is NOT "environmental protection". Please understand that and stop treating this like good news.

8510 2018-03-09 19:40:42 Norway is a very special case. 2x as much oil as U.K. very small population. SNP use it also without looking at numbers.
8511 2018-03-09 19:40:42 The funniest part is now he'll pay people like us to fix the chainsaw, sharpen it, or replace the chain, pay for the gas and oil it needs. They don't understand that all they are doing is changing how they pay.

8527 2018-03-09 19:38:58 Males should learn how to place it on sweat gland areas, especially behind the ears. When their lady or any lady they hug (if they single) the scent take them on a magic carpet ride. My personal made scent is an oil mixture close to a fresh baby scent and other close secrets. Ha!
8528 2018-03-09 19:38:51 It's still pretty much winter, so, throw a bunch of whatever veggies you have into a pan with olive oil and a chopped onion. Bake for 45 minutes. Put into blender and cover with water. Add a boullion cube, blend. Put back on the stove and heat through. Nom nom.
8529 2018-03-09 19:38:47 I don't think Perry is crazy or even a religious zealot.  I think he's paid well by the oil & gas lobbies and spouts their rhetoric for personal profit.  #FirePerry because he is NOT serving the American people.

8532 2018-03-09 19:38:04 The purpose of this fresh water mining by the people is for personal and domestic consumption which govt failed to provide in the first place, and not comparable with crude oil/ gas that has underlying commercial value

8545 2018-03-09 19:36:14 ok.looks like jaw boners  aim is to protect oil price in exchanges and sell physical oil at higher price.
8546 2018-03-09 19:35:58 I’m not you guys I’m one person. And I am not organization. And I don’t know, are you a bot? check your pulse… Do you have one? Do your joints ache or do they rust? Do you eat food or do you require motor oil? Your answers will determine if you’re a bot. 
8547 2018-03-09 19:35:57 In other news, I’m getting my oil changed and this girl will NOT stop staring at me.

8554 2018-03-09 19:35:10 Does it still feel like Winter?  A perfect way to warm up is with some Tomato Basil Soup. Add a drop of Basil oil in place of dried Basil in your favorite recipe for a full robust flavor that will have you coming back for more.

8556 2018-03-09 19:35:04 Lol. I think most women do. I was fortunate enough to know a spot in NYC ran by some African brothers. All they use is natural ingredients and can even mix whatever you want into an oil, incense, etc...
8557 2018-03-09 19:35:03 "Shell Oil acting as a multinational global conglomerate payed bribes to government officials in Nigeria. They payed the military to conduct raids on innocent protesters homes and hang innocent protest leaders in order to suppress the protesting against Shell."
8558 2018-03-09 19:35:03 If you live by the rule of law, then you should know that legal precedent by the BCSC has stated that oil spills encroach on the Feds power to approve interprovincial pipelines. But knowing the law is the difference here. Try again.
8559 2018-03-09 19:34:20 If you took away the oil even the democrats wouldn't care where we got it from. Their Xbox is made from oil.
8560 2018-03-09 19:34:08 I love hair masks! But maybe get a new oil? Which ones do you use?
8561 2018-03-09 19:33:52 They are finding out medical marijuana is good for a lot of conditions! It helps with autism, seizures, cancer many things. What nobody talks about is FECO oil is helping many with COPD! Relaxes the muscles around the lungs and clears up inflammation. Pain & nausea & more!

8564 2018-03-09 19:33:14 albertaatnoon I am not believing the rhetoric that this pipeline benefits all Albertans.  How about re-training people in the oil and gas industry so they can have viable employment in an industry that has a future?

8574 2018-03-09 19:32:09 Buying a house was a horrible experience for me. No seller ever wants to come down in price/fix anything. Got the owner of the house we bought to agree to replace the septic, oil tank and exposed electrical wires outside. They tore up driveway & never fixed. Tore up lawn too.
8575 2018-03-09 19:32:08 Who calls education an "industry"? Americans have it all wrong...
8576 2018-03-09 19:32:02 All this rhoetoric of the Constituion being thrown around and yet I doubt you even know the legal precedents set by the BCSC. An oil spill encroaches on the Feds power to approve. BC will win this, as they have done in the past. Political posturing doesn't beat legal precedent.

Oh wait that won’t happen as long as Quebec politicians continue to be corrupt and receive money under the table from foreign countries supplying them Oil while they also steal west money in equalization payments. F ck off already put your dress on
8582 2018-03-09 19:30:52 Yeah and they gave us atos too, illegal wars,  economic incompetence, they lied abt oil, manipulation of 70s referendum denied equal pay to Glasgow women for a decade, 
Filled their pockets with expenses,  protected paedophiles the list is endless of their corruption

8592 2018-03-09 19:29:53 My allergies have been SO horrible today, and nothing was helping, so I just stood in the shower for like 30 minutes with some eucalyptus oil and I can finally (mostly) breathe. I might be turning into one of those essential oil women.

8596 2018-03-09 19:29:13 I made a fortune in the oil field.  But it's no place for snowflakes, it's real work.
8597 2018-03-09 19:29:00 The distance is less than 200 miles, so there are rules for divvying up the area. Yes, Shetland would probably retain some oil reserves, but an awful lot would stay with Scotland. Again though, where's the evidence that Shetland has ANY desire for that?
8598 2018-03-09 19:29:00 I brought a book to read while waiting for my oil change and then I forgot the book in the car and they’ve already taken it why am I like this
8599 2018-03-09 19:28:52 because oil helps tech

8601 2018-03-09 19:28:36 The global demand for oil is increasing so we need to get our o&g to global markets. More sales = more tax revenue, more investment

8606 2018-03-09 19:27:06 @RachelNotley says there are a "multiplicity of options" other than the wine ban or cutting off oil and gas exports to BC - but won't offer detail because it's important not to show her hand at this stage.

8623 2018-03-09 19:23:58 It is very possible that Putin is behind this.  All the explosions are being set off close to the Russia's line which I am sure does not make them happy. Russia is sneaking oil to them because of the sanctions that are against N. Korea
8624 2018-03-09 19:23:53 I know you anarchists don’t like it, but we live in a nation where rule of law is paramount. Film yourself getting arrested and make yourself a name, but don’t kid yourself, freedom will win and the oil will flow.
8625 2018-03-09 19:23:48 So now both #ableg sides recognise there is an existing pipeline and can stop with the 'land-locked' bullshit

Whose fault that AB oil is too expensive?

8629 2018-03-09 19:22:41 Last few times I 've been it's ridiculous even what's happening around Aldgate...roads and roads blocked off as towers go up flats, but also overspill offices.

The idea London, or the rest of the UK is living off oil Revs is crazy bonkers....
8630 2018-03-09 19:21:48 idk if it’s just me but my go to face care product is dhc cleansing oil it’s SOOOO good
8631 2018-03-09 19:21:44 You might be right more generally, but certainly in the European oil painting tradition, great works are great works in spite of the tradition from which they arise. When it transcends being a mechanism for advertising rich people's wealth this is rare and almost miraculous.

8633 2018-03-09 19:21:31 It still costs money for gas, car payments, oil changes, tires, upkeep, depreciation to use ones own vehicle. It's not actually free. Plus if you're on the road for wrestling you can't very well work your regular day job so you're losing money hand over fist to do so.
8634 2018-03-09 19:21:28 Coconut oil has my face shining bright like a diamond and I'm here for it
8635 2018-03-09 19:21:22 2/ u can’t believe that then all your argument is moot.  To assume that oil isn’t involved is another atrocious claim.  The Crimean port that Russia took to move oil out of the Ukrainians hands and then Reestablish their only allying in the Middle East

8649 2018-03-09 19:19:54 The problem is not the pipeline, it's the oil tankers moving the product. The only way is to refine, the pipeline should include a refinery on the BC coast. Work together for a combined solution that benefits both.

8685 2018-03-09 19:14:49 I didn't say it didn't. But they are making billions pushing poisons why would they want to offer us a cure? Even CBD oil is extortionately priced. For the very same reason. Person = Walking wallet/purse. It's not rocket science! 
8686 2018-03-09 19:14:45 Awesome. Alberta Government announcing oil and gas industry diversification by turning more oil into plastics.  How ironic  Is thAt. 
8687 2018-03-09 19:14:34 最低４枚多くても８枚で充分だねｗｗｗｗｗ
8688 2018-03-09 19:14:33 Hey @EPA I liked you better when you worked to protect the environment, you know, like your name says.  Now you just really suck. Please stop being a tool (for oil/chemical co.s ) so earth doesn’t end up like beginning of Wall-E
8689 2018-03-09 19:14:08 My doc recommended fish oil, vitamins B and D and hard exercise. All of these helped keep the anxiety down to a dull roar. I am not a big fan of pills but if your anxiety is really bad, Xanax (just 1/4 of a pill) helps a lot. A whole pill puts me to sleep.
8690 2018-03-09 19:14:04 somewhat off topic... but do you guys keep your popcorn buds or you lolipop them? to me, it depends if the whole plant is going into oil then I live them, especially on smaller grows
8691 2018-03-09 19:13:55 No one said anything about banning oil. But more research and more volume will bring efficiency up and costs down, if investment continues. But if all we concentrate on is oil, that won't happen. And oil is going to run out someday. Wouldn't it be good to have alternatives?
8692 2018-03-09 19:13:53 New oil diffuser, it’s lit 
8693 2018-03-09 19:13:46 あぁ、だが一日前に１２枚手に入れたから充分なのだ。。。

8695 2018-03-09 19:13:31 My dad changed my oil, rotated my tires and cleaned my car all while having the flu... I give him such a hard time and yet he’s amazing
8696 2018-03-09 19:13:29 mega bazooka in $oil markets, thirst for #oil
8697 2018-03-09 19:13:29 Well I thought he wouldn't get elected! Looking at this & must believe that Republicans take their orders from the Koch's period!Seth if I am wrong tell me!This is Oil trying to hold the  back & keep us burning oil! Now the regulation's to keep us safe are gone too!This is BAD!
8698 2018-03-09 19:13:25 Coconut oil is good bro. Research it.
8699 2018-03-09 19:13:14 Got home after a nights drink, saw the coconut oil near the sink. Decided to bring in to my bedroom cause I didn’t want to risk it falling. Brought it in, trip on my bed & broke a glass of COCONUT OIL in my bedroom. OF ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE BROKEN IT HAS TO BE COCONUT OIL.
8700 2018-03-09 19:12:57 This ticket and party better be worth it Pinstripe! Hurts me to spend this much oil in Part 6 of #LetsPlay #Pinstripe on the #PS4Pro!
8701 2018-03-09 19:12:33 I can’t believe I’ve been living life without using @tartecosmetics ‘s maracuja oil lol. I’m in love  #staymoisturized #face #skin #hair
8702 2018-03-09 19:12:18 You can put it in the win column!!   Oilers win 8-6!!!
8703 2018-03-09 19:12:09 And just like that... oil comes back to life
8704 2018-03-09 19:11:50 Have fun walking everywhere. And all the other items that are made from oil? Have fun without those too.
8705 2018-03-09 19:11:44 Oil Gang!

8706 2018-03-09 19:11:43 Bye , Bye , " Olive Oil "  as " Pop Eye " would say !
8707 2018-03-09 19:11:18 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
8708 2018-03-09 19:11:16 I thought the Government wasn't responsible for creating jobs? That its the Private market? Why aren't they hiring? Maybe because the OIL biz is still slow?
8709 2018-03-09 19:11:10 That’s actually scary! What kind of cooking oil we are consuming!
8710 2018-03-09 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: undercooked crust with damp motor oil and chicken.
8711 2018-03-09 19:11:04 Omg!!!  It’s a jul. they make canibus oil and nicotine pods for them. None of us who weren’t on the racist tirade with them know which it was. Please for the love of baby Jesus stop arguing this asinine point
8712 2018-03-09 19:10:51 This is so kind of you to reply so extensively! So...we already have pastels, oil pastels, watercolours, acrylics and charcoal.  I’m feeling that perhaps it’s not the materials we’re lacking, but a culture of drawing/creating art.  The sketchbooks sound great idea.
8713 2018-03-09 19:10:43 Apply black seed oil
8714 2018-03-09 19:10:38 Lmao...  I equate masturbation to changin ya oil every 5,000 miles..  Keeps all the valves firing properly  
8715 2018-03-09 19:10:33 Y'all trippin, they not sitting around here as well as other places, you can't get 250 games on them, no difference then paying someone to change your oil if you don't want to change it yourself, what is with the hate????????
8716 2018-03-09 19:10:28 Having said that.. you would brighten up Sky Cricket.. @BumbleCricket @nassercricket @WardyShorts are no oil paintings
8717 2018-03-09 19:10:21 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
8718 2018-03-09 19:10:16 @KMBenedetto you can add selling of our public lands to oil and gas companies to your interests.
8719 2018-03-09 19:10:07 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
8720 2018-03-09 19:10:05 Take a look at the stock market today. It spiked too. These are the funds and algos that buy EVERYTHING blindly when there is a perception of "good news". This is not oil related at all.
8721 2018-03-09 19:09:42 I think it’s because she draws attention to it even when everyone seems to have forgotten. She rarely forgets to mention it. I would like to assume there are other women in her predicament of owning an oil block perhaps?
8722 2018-03-09 19:09:31 "burning the midnight oil" would be an understatement

"burning the oil factory" na ni nga level 
8723 2018-03-09 19:09:27 God's timing is the timing that the Holy Spirit In Me tells me that soon and very soon he will finish his promise that he made to me from the foundations of the Earth the groom is coming the groom is coming trim your lamps do you have any oil where's your love don't be entangled
8724 2018-03-09 19:09:24 Raid? My oil mix needs enhancing
8725 2018-03-09 19:09:16 Wishing I was layed up under the sun with my man rubbing oil all over my body 
8726 2018-03-09 19:09:10 .@MartinHeinrich Using $ raised from oil/gas/coal leases conceivably in our National Parks to fund Park fixes? You've got to be kidding? Who is going to fix the irreparable damage done to pour public lands by the leases?
8727 2018-03-09 19:09:06 Please and thank you. I can’t cornroll i need to learn I’m so sad about that. I can commit to wash and oil yes
8728 2018-03-09 19:09:01 Peppermint oil in my defuser and my whole house smells like our Costa Rican bungalow and I have never been happier 
8729 2018-03-09 19:09:00 مابه احلى من اللحم والرزوز 
8730 2018-03-09 19:08:47 Leon, you can keep your entitled opinion in Alberta with your oil and single based resource economy. Times are changing and the environment we leave for our children is more important than profits. KM will never happen and the courts will see to that.
8731 2018-03-09 19:08:43 I'm going to leave work once my phone charge to 100%. I'm at 95% right now. A full battery is like driving a car after a fresh oil change.
8732 2018-03-09 19:08:43 For all the ones struggling with their face try jojoba oil  I feel restored
8733 2018-03-09 19:08:35 as you know vix spot and vix futures are not mechanically linked, and you cannot BUY the VIX, unlike gas or oil where you could arb the spot vs fut.  VIX does not give that method
8734 2018-03-09 19:08:17 Hey Martin Shkreli, fuck you you Pharma Bitch. Have fun in jail. Get used to olive oil and  empty sandwich bags. You’ll see what I’m talking about.

8736 2018-03-09 19:08:04 I think if you can commit to wash/oil every 2 weeks you should be ok, can you corn row your own hair? Or maybe some raid spray will help... guess this is a project I can work on lolol
8737 2018-03-09 19:08:00 Kemkaran-Humble!!!! 8-5
8738 2018-03-09 19:07:41 No hisses, no telling him to stand down... and by her face Ezreal knew that she enjoyed this moment. He smirked but for just a second out of fear to ruin the moment, then ground his torso against her a few times. He would slide right over her, the oil now spreading onto his own -
8739 2018-03-09 19:07:30 1.Definitely what Rebekah said. Chalk pastels need fixing but oil pastels don't. Watercolours, heavy paper, like cartridge and watercolour paper (other is the paints destroy it) and DECENT brushes, fine and medium.
8740 2018-03-09 19:07:22 Hi Robin, we would definitely recommend taking a peek at our Jason And The Argan Oil Shampoo Bar! With Moroccan argan oil in a moisturizing glycerin base to leave your hair smooth, shiny and strong! 
8741 2018-03-09 19:06:54 I have had similar thoughts since 2014.. Another part of me thinks take the oil and piss off!!
8742 2018-03-09 19:06:51 Just like he helped Coal miners. His ideals to be self sufficient are helping our oil industry, too. We need to be more self reliant as a nation.
8743 2018-03-09 19:06:51 But I worked, for my oil changed, saw my beautiful woman, and now I have the rest of the day with my babies. #iamblessed
8744 2018-03-09 19:06:36 I have lost my mind ... been looking for my oil sheen all day get bck home it's in the refrigerator 
8745 2018-03-09 19:06:18 Jamaican Black Castor Oil line from Shea Moisture. Works wonders. It took like 3 months before I could tell my hair was growing but it grew 4 inches this past year.  It all depends on your preference though. I use total repair bc it helps all around but use Shea Moisture a lot.
8746 2018-03-09 19:06:09 I found someone to change my oil. Who knows how to lay tile? Lol
8747 2018-03-09 19:06:08 at night to make sure i get rid of any impurities i use raw african black soap, but it is DRYING girl, so i make sure to moisturize w the raw shea butter. In the mornings i use the burt’s bees facial cleansing oil, &moisturize w the Zoe Organics Cream!
8748 2018-03-09 19:05:32 I think a surprising amount of people are deficient in various vitamins and  minerals despite thinking they eat a decent diet. My diet is restricted atm so I take fish oil to ensure omega 3s & I've actually noticed a difference with my skin since that point.
8749 2018-03-09 19:05:20 Those trees were planted as a crop and not part of the natural ecosystem. The wind farms are just making use of the restored landscape.
It's the rainforests cut down for palm oil and cattle farming that we need to really worry about.
8750 2018-03-09 19:05:17 Let’s hope so. Would be great if we could depend less on oil and coal.
8751 2018-03-09 19:05:14 drowning cats in my school and with semi truck references. The overweight women references are associated with the name Bobby, a form of Robert and they were made today while grocery shopping. They are attached to my grandmother in New Orleans with an oil and gas reference. Bobby
8752 2018-03-09 19:05:13 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
8753 2018-03-09 19:05:07 At least it tastes pretty good.  This one was applesauce-cinnamon flavored, with some blood orange-infused olive oil playing the role of the fat. 
8754 2018-03-09 19:05:04 As more of the truth leaks out, the politicians and political pawns go into overdrive to divert attention away from the failures of a lot of groups here in Broward. I stopped listening to people who defend Sheriff Israel.
8755 2018-03-09 19:04:55 Box of oil pastels, chalk pastels, tin of watercolours would be a good start

8760 2018-03-09 19:04:12 Semeniuk!!!!!  7-5 Oilers.
8761 2018-03-09 19:04:01 Except the Oil never had a goaltender like Schneider back then. But hopefully Nurse keeps improving and Talbot rebounds. They aren’t going to have the cap space to add the talent they’re missing on the wing without some serious wheeling and dealing.
8762 2018-03-09 19:04:01 You're an idiot if you think we're there "for the oil".

8772 2018-03-09 19:02:58 The world’s second superpower is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms all over the continent.

China is constructing everything from roads and bridges to stadiums and important government buildings.
8773 2018-03-09 19:02:57 Tip #7 Need some long ass nails to dig into your guy's back during sex? First garlic on your nail beds. Second coconut oil on your cuticles. BUH BAM! Longer nails. You're welcome!
8774 2018-03-09 19:02:44 Kudos to you! Look into omega supplements, at proper dosage can be as effective as Prozac. As well as CBD oil, especially with tryptoPhan, an essential amino acid. You got this!!!
8775 2018-03-09 19:02:44 The oil companies and the pipeline operator are all US owned businesses. They’ll make easier money exporting bitumen than they would by building and operating refineries. Easy money for US and China businesses.

8781 2018-03-09 19:01:52 I want to go home and take a shower and do a coconut oil hair mask and put on my glow tanning lotion because I’m the best.
8782 2018-03-09 19:01:42 I'm not particularly enjoying having to keep my 4 year old away from the heaters I've had to put out. I don't fancy him getting burnt because we've not had any oil delivered.
8783 2018-03-09 19:01:35 That’s not true at all. Obama put harsh sanctions on Russia after they violated international laws. Which hurt a multi million dollar oil deal with Exxon and Russia and pissed off rex Tillerson and putin.

8823 2018-03-09 18:57:52 There once was a day when OPEC would call & threaten to cut off or increase the cost of oil to $140/barrel which they did and the correction was U.S. energy production. The same is needed for steel and aluminum that can be used to cripple a country & crush or oppress the economy

8842 2018-03-09 18:55:16 Within 6-months we could see sanctions on Venezuelan oil imports and also the destruction of the JCPOA deal with Iran, which subsequently could result in new oil sanctions.  Must be what they are banking on!

8850 2018-03-09 18:54:41 i got combo too, but during winter i’m dry. what could help is using a oil based soap, or cream soap, it’s superrrr soft and doesnt cause any dry patches. And it doesn’t make your oil go crazy just bc it’s helping it.

8852 2018-03-09 18:53:47 These are yummy potatoe chips, maybe the classic ones. Originally, they are made out of thinly sliced fried and salted potatoes. Conceivably, today they are made differently. The salt and oil in the frying process aren't healthy and tend to make people thick and addicted.

8858 2018-03-09 18:53:01 #KeepItInTheGround: One oil well takes an area of about 20 feet by 30 feet. To equal the DAILY BTU output from JUST ONE oil well would take an average of 35,000 ACRES of wind turbines, and 40,000 ACRES of solar panels. X that by the thousands of oil wells in operation.
8859 2018-03-09 18:53:01 In an alternate universe, @jjhorgan responded to Alberta's threat to cut off oil to BC by announcing an action plan for the complete phase-out of fossil fuels in transportation and housing within 5 years, saying "We will never let threats stop us from doing what's right."

8865 2018-03-09 18:52:09 It is more expensive and less efficient to create renewable energy than it is to create crude oil. If oil was banned worldwide, there would not be enough renewable energy in the world to supply the whole world.

8960 2018-03-09 18:40:25 Nothing worse than a washed up doctor like @drzoltanrona spreading nonsense. Worse and more embarrassing he's a Canadian. Snake oil is the only term that could describe him and what he does.
8961 2018-03-09 18:40:13 Canada is run by liberal socialists! Hiring 50,000 public servants. What a joke! Destroying the oil patch. Taxing the sh**t out of business and personal. Vote then out!
8962 2018-03-09 18:40:11 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
8963 2018-03-09 18:40:00 quesadillas are just burritos that got run over by the oil truck

8968 2018-03-09 18:39:18 Menopausal Hobbit, 4.2%. They said “For Pete’s sake, Janet, do NOT make an ale that’s 70% olive oil!”. But did she listen? Of course not. Look, I love the woman but this stuff is rancid. It’s greasy as you like and stinks of mould. Women, eh? 
8969 2018-03-09 18:39:08 People always ask me what has changed my natural/curly hair game.

JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL all the way! It’s an amazing sealant especially in the colder months, and it promotes hair growth. Get some!
8970 2018-03-09 18:39:07 Clinique Super City Block  SPF 40 has been my go to for a while. Oil free & great under makeup! 
8971 2018-03-09 18:38:53 Seriously? One 42 gallon barrel of crude oil can produce about 19 gallons of petrol.
8972 2018-03-09 18:38:51 I second the tea tree oil collection! My life saver

8977 2018-03-09 18:37:58 Morning: cleanser (use any low pH one because mine is temporarily discontinued), Snail Bee Essence, sunscreen

Evening: oil cleanser (I use Innisfree Apple), cleanser, Shark Sauce serum, Snail Bee Essence, moisturizer (sometimes Mizon Black Snail, sometimes that + Joseon Cream)
8978 2018-03-09 18:37:52 And I’m sure a few yards from this place is an oil rig pumping $b of dollars  of oil , each year, what a tragedy of wicked leadership all across our land.
8979 2018-03-09 18:37:43 Forecast says 15 degrees so pack your suntan oil!! 
8980 2018-03-09 18:37:43 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts hemp seed oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part tahini. Add parsley and maple syrup to taste.
8981 2018-03-09 18:37:32 I HATE COMING for an oil change bc they try and sell me all these extras and I feel so bad saying no  I’m sorry I’m on a budget lol!
8982 2018-03-09 18:37:23 went out to buy oil,

8984 2018-03-09 18:37:07 Improvements in job ops are not just limited to one sector like Oil& gas..POTUS is slowlyuntying the hands of the American entrepreneur!

8987 2018-03-09 18:37:04 Just figured out how to prepare tofu without oil and make it taste good AF 
8988 2018-03-09 18:36:59 You can imagine my excitement about having to take my truck for an oil change lol

8991 2018-03-09 18:36:26 He did drain the swamp, destroying a vibrant, often misunderstood ecosystem and left us with the muck and putrid stench of decay.  It’s ok, though, in a million years it’ll be oil.
8992 2018-03-09 18:36:24 Water and oil will never mix
8993 2018-03-09 18:36:15 Some great tracks on the album, snake oil, all that remains and where you sleeping are my top three 
8994 2018-03-09 18:36:13 Thankfully with the new laws I’m able to get CBD oil at certain locations now which is amazing for me. It’s helped so much with my PTSD and anxiety I’m so glad to hear it’s working for you too.
8995 2018-03-09 18:36:04 Jojoba oil be having my hair glossy as hell lol
8996 2018-03-09 18:35:44 Sheesh why would we need to drill offshore when We can just get oil by sacrificing men and women in the armed forces in BS wars that we shouldn’t be getting into?

the mixture of that combining like water and oil, just like her chances are when it comes to ever finding the one.
9000 2018-03-09 18:35:12 A bronzing facial mask, sparkling white, with Saharan hibiscus, peacock oil, and exfoliating Thai sand. It comes as a sticky gel.
9001 2018-03-09 18:35:04 That doesn't seem like very much.  I would have assumed a higher amount with the oil industry.
9002 2018-03-09 18:34:50 เบือ
9003 2018-03-09 18:34:44 There is a bigger threat to Alberta's oil at the moment and it is the American foundation funded movement to stop the pipeline. It appears it is going to get very dirty.
9004 2018-03-09 18:34:40 They may push the boundaries but they will never break the barrier that major oil and auto makers build to prevent consumers from owning a vehicle that achieves 500 mpge.
9005 2018-03-09 18:34:32 Did a skybox for an Oil Kings game and that was pretty sweet too.
9006 2018-03-09 18:34:16 then get some of the oil money flowing in the situation ,,,
9007 2018-03-09 18:34:15 "That oil rig movie was so amazing!"

Oh, you mean that piece of corporate propaganda? I'll take your word for it.
9008 2018-03-09 18:34:10 People would love to see the death glares @CornerstoneDK and I exchanged when the Oil and the Leafs played.
9009 2018-03-09 18:33:58 @Raghav_Bahl Few years ago a committee constituted by the government had reccomended that special norms should be adopted by all Oil Marketing Companies while posting officers/personnel at sensitive locations storing and distributing fuels across the country
9010 2018-03-09 18:33:58 Aw, I’m a bad boy? I’m a bad boy? Put some vegetable oil on it, that’ll make you feel better. Okay, bye sexy.

9012 2018-03-09 18:33:52 Damn I’m at the car shop and some dude been here for a cool minute and he just getting an oil change lol take that ass to spoiled only takes 10 minutes 
9013 2018-03-09 18:33:38 finally getting a damn oil change  I’m so happy my car takes conventional oil 
9014 2018-03-09 18:33:29 Just made me a nice container size of coconut oil, honey, sugar, cinnamon, apple cider vinegar, and some Jamaican castor oil for a nice exfoliating blend
9015 2018-03-09 18:33:25 What kind of oil? And can it be with bananas as well or does it have to be with plantains?
9016 2018-03-09 18:33:19 It's fairly substantial. £60/billion a year for 20-25 years. Scotland would be liable for 9% obviously, but we'd have 94% of the oil and the ability to issue more oil bonds. rUk would need to conjure £45-50bn a year from thin air. Presumably printing more money like Mugabe.

9018 2018-03-09 18:32:50 :) Needs a lot of work. Kitchen is weird and it and both bathrooms are original 1950s in bad shape. Old oil heat. Old electrical & plumbing. Probably no insulation in the walls.  Etc.

Probably $75K-150K of remodeling to make it a nice place actually worth $600K they paid. #crazy
9019 2018-03-09 18:32:49 Cue the Midnight Oil playlist
9020 2018-03-09 18:32:43 @Raghav_Bahl Sir,India's largest state owned Fortune 500 oil company still does not have any norms for posting Quality Control personnel at sensitive locations even when the adulteration mafia is a multi billion rupee business in the country
9021 2018-03-09 18:32:39 Refiners capture the price spread so who/where refiners are matters. Exported dilbit represents lost jobs and profits for Canada, but not to oil companies that own receiving refineries.
9022 2018-03-09 18:32:33 But there’s all that hugely problematic oil and gas in there, so we wouldn’t be wanting that.
9023 2018-03-09 18:32:29 Waiting for car oil change. Noticing the younger people waiting are all wearing pajamas.
9024 2018-03-09 18:32:28 You talk a lot about logic but can't seem to understand that BC coasters want coal ports gone as well. Both are a dying industry, it's time for coal and oil to go away entirely.
9025 2018-03-09 18:32:27 Hello, thanks for reaching out. The dosage for the oil is on the label bottle. Thanks!
9026 2018-03-09 18:32:19 With Sarah's "lesser" college education, she still had the good sense to pass the ACES bill that generated over $20 billion in oil profits for AK. Dumbocrat commie elitist CA politicians and some voters refuse make profits from state oil that could've easily wiped out its debt
9027 2018-03-09 18:32:13 Hot oil treatments are great it's softer now but I still can't do nothing with it. Top bun not even cute

9031 2018-03-09 18:31:00 So apparently peppermint oil helps open the pores on your scalp so moisture can settle in to you follicles. If this is a lie I’m sending out letters to cuss y’all out
9032 2018-03-09 18:30:56 So my car went in for a service last week at @PeugeotUK Suddenly I get an oil leak and where ever I parked it left a big puddle of oil. Took it back to the garage today and they said it was “residue” someone messed up but they won’t admit it!!!
9033 2018-03-09 18:30:54 OIL DIFF: 3.51 -> 3.55
9034 2018-03-09 18:30:52 I think you refuse a turmeric latte but have coconut oil on your person you may avoid being barred from a west London food emporium.
9035 2018-03-09 18:30:38 I was struggling until Black soap/ activates charcoal soap. Which hazel and grape seed oil was good for me in Nashville water. Alcohol and shea butter do the trick for me in memphis water
9036 2018-03-09 18:30:35 Look at oil spills around the world. How it impacts wildlife and environments. It's vital that steps be taken to stop pollution now. You are 7 million. Just the toxins from cars are destroying the country. Saw coastline 2day. Removal of beach huts. But hey trash heaps everywhere
9037 2018-03-09 18:30:33 That was my first thought also! Putin's fingerprints are all over this! Especially after the reported hacking of the Opening Ceremonies at the Olympics and the Oil they have been delivering to NK! Putin is helping tRump to distract from the Mueller Investigation!
9038 2018-03-09 18:30:28 No but I think its cause I eat chic fil a and they cook their things with peanut oil and that's what's making me break out.
9039 2018-03-09 18:30:17 Resources are only as valuable as what price they command on the market. The price is set externally through markets in UK/US. Oil producing countries were swimming in it with a $100 price but all it took was a collapse for them to start running budget deficits
9040 2018-03-09 18:30:15 Court 'heard'?
Who is on trial?
Which oil marketers?
Which PDP chiefs?
Is this part of 'fighting kwaraption'?
Which mumus believe this?
Nonsense.
9041 2018-03-09 18:29:53 Standard Oil, which used railroads to get across about startups, that's it.
9042 2018-03-09 18:29:43 Why is it okay for a narcissistic, rude, crude,  egomaniacal, w/ NO impulse control and has Oppositional Defiance Disorder, with NO experience in diplomacy, the speech patterns of a 3rd grader, who wants to be the biggest weapons and oil dealer in the world deal w/N. Korea?
9043 2018-03-09 18:29:42 Does NK have oil though
9044 2018-03-09 18:29:11 Use oil so it sticks!

9046 2018-03-09 18:28:50 My shimmering body oil and butter just came in and I’m ready to glow 
9047 2018-03-09 18:28:37 NOON:  @theCAODC stands behind @RachelNotley's threat to put the squeeze on oil headed to BC. Do you?

 "Tidewater access for Canadian crude products is just too important an issue to back down from," says CAODC President Mark Scholz.

9052 2018-03-09 18:27:47 Momentum continues. I am sure some teams burn mid-night oil to complete their hacking. Can't wait to see final results!
9053 2018-03-09 18:27:43 Hi Gerry my clouds here are lit up from the light pollution just behind me from streetlights, houselights and chiefly from the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal and Gas plant flare stacks which are just over the hill - the more wind there is, the stronger the orange tint on the clouds is.
9054 2018-03-09 18:27:39 In 2012, six oil and gas companies contributed a total of between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the NRA... the NRA lent its support to legislation that would open up more federal public lands to fossil-fuel extraction.
9055 2018-03-09 18:27:30 Interesting...i have been oil pulling for years and never once gagged or threw it up.

9058 2018-03-09 18:27:19 emulsifying oil cleansers are an absolute miracle

why scrub your face harshly to get excess oil off when you can emulsify your oil with just your finger tips, rinse it off, and use a super gentle cleanser instead?

9061 2018-03-09 18:27:05 Perfect! It's gonna work like an increased carbon tax combined with a regulatory reduction of oil imports, will reduce tar sand market exposure, be signal to divest, force BC to innovate in transport, put a sock in KM's gaping hole. Good job @RachelNotley #bcpoli #doingOurWork
9062 2018-03-09 18:27:01 No, because the commie CA could be bought out with china's trillions in surplus $. If that happens, a real-life Red Dawn can occur; but taxing resistors out of CA seems like the easy way. Offshore oil can wipe out CA debt, but dims refuse to sell it for profit. CA has no military
9063 2018-03-09 18:26:57 I truly didn’t until this moment, but it is clear to me that he’s harry styles if he was an oil spill that gave him the super power of brooding
9064 2018-03-09 18:26:55 black castor oil smells like cigarettes
9065 2018-03-09 18:26:54 Mindfulness has been commodified. And that's worse than the snake oil sold by "skinny yoga babes"
9066 2018-03-09 18:26:47 That’s what the oil companies paid her for ...
9067 2018-03-09 18:26:45 You could talk to someone on the phone for your own personal car. Or you could do my oil change so I can get the fuck outta here.
9068 2018-03-09 18:26:45 If you get gorilla glue on your hands, or any type of glue for that matter, wash your hands in a mixture of cooking oil and salt.
9069 2018-03-09 18:26:43 I did a Google search for CBD gummies and oil. A doctor should be able to prescribe something better though. If you can find a willing one.
9070 2018-03-09 18:26:39 You need a dry oil! And wash your face with cool water!?

9073 2018-03-09 18:25:38 We never did find out how the rUk intends to service the performance bonds it's issued on oil that it wouldn't own post-indy. BBC to their credit did chin the chancellor about it once. Needless to say his answer was in no way an explanation.

9076 2018-03-09 18:24:34 : I've been living my life at full speed with a partially rebuilt car. Yeah, it gets me where I need to go, but it constantly overheats, is leaking oil everywhere, gets terrible gas mileage, and is constantly in need of repairs

9079 2018-03-09 18:23:53 El problema ahora son los restos de hidrocarburos de la refinería San Lorenzo que sin control pueden significar un alto impacto ambiental para la zona, según confirmó a @radio2rosario el gerente de Seguridad y Medio Ambiente de Oil Combustibles
9080 2018-03-09 18:23:52 But with High Steel prices it will be too expensive to drill in Former Pristine Wilderness Areas that you sold out to big oil and gas.
9081 2018-03-09 18:23:44 He's not even trying to pretend he's not an oil industry puppet.
9082 2018-03-09 18:23:36 Love being spoken to like a literal child when I walk into any auto shop... sir I could do this oil change myself but it's mother loving cold out there. I skipped a waitlist due to my "helplessness" though so whatever 
9083 2018-03-09 18:23:20 this guy at wendys asked for sriracha by saying “can I get some of the hot oil” 

confusion ensued as he persisted to refer to it as hot oil
9084 2018-03-09 18:23:10 I realized I was 1,000 miles passed due for an oil change while I was driving so I drove straight to a jiffy lube instead of putting it off and that is what I like to call adulting
9085 2018-03-09 18:23:07 My waves dipping today and that coconut oil got em shining 
9086 2018-03-09 18:23:03 I've realized adulting is getting an oil change during your lunch break because there's too many responsibilities in one day that need to be taken care of 
9087 2018-03-09 18:22:58 I hope so cuz he presently leads the league in goals against

9092 2018-03-09 18:22:23 Yep, his endorsements are the kiss of death. He tries to sabotage ppl from the actual D party. He wants a legacy, cos all he's achieved so far is a poor voting record, nonsense legislative initiatives, a shite personal life, and trumpian-like snake oil for the political novices.

9102 2018-03-09 18:20:55 Oil and dope heads ; )
9103 2018-03-09 18:20:53 There's something fishy about this. Coincidence that Russia and China have been secretly providing N Korea with oil and now perhaps Putin arranges this "summit" to boost Trump's status as world leader?

9110 2018-03-09 18:20:26 if you put lotion on yo face and not an oil based moisturizer.....ion trust you.
9111 2018-03-09 18:20:25 The likelihood that oil company studies would find evidence of damage/downsides resulting from offshore drilling?  0%
9112 2018-03-09 18:20:14 Pep Boyz ain’t shit. I needed a oil pressure sensor & they quoted me 285. I told my hood mechanic & he said he could fix it. Went to Auto Zone, got the part for 13 dollars & he charged me 20 bucks to put it on. 
33 bucks vs 285 smh 
9113 2018-03-09 18:20:07 Going to listen to this either tonight or over the weekend, but when I do I’ll be sure to pop open some banana oil when I do. Now I just have to buy some banana oil & figure out what it’s used for b/c I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to be drink it.
9114 2018-03-09 18:20:07 @LBC this woman doesn’t want bp to sponsor the arts. Wonder how she gets about!!and isn’t oil used in paint?!

9121 2018-03-09 18:19:14 A couple of years ago we all loved Russians. There were TV shows about them coming to London and buying houses, becoming singers, designers etc..they were soon much fun. 
Now the powers-that-be have decided that we don't like Putin, Russia, or Russians any more. Why? Oil, Gas?

9126 2018-03-09 18:18:44 @Dove I bought Dove anti-frizz oil therapy shampoo on Amazon bc I couldn't find it in store. This bottle I just opened has a smell like it's been contaminated (like bacteria.) Is it possible this shampoo has been d/c & I am getting old bottles?
9127 2018-03-09 18:18:30 Let nature take it's course or blame it on Alberta oil.
9128 2018-03-09 18:18:17 Me
9129 2018-03-09 18:18:16 Another one! 
9130 2018-03-09 18:18:16 Fine. When Italy ends up unable to sell Ferraris,Chianti and olive oil because of your non existent potential free trade deals with the US come Italexit, like the Uk wants but won't get too, get back to me
9131 2018-03-09 18:18:06 Something like 96% of our federal revenue came from tariffs then. There was no Income Tax. I think they are a great idea. We can be self sufficient if we wanted to. Look how we are doing with oil and gas now. Just unleash the economy and it will grow.
9132 2018-03-09 18:18:03 What’s a good eyelash serum? I’ve been using castor oil and it works pretty well. I’ve always had long eyelashes but bc I also wear false ones I want to ensure that mine stay long and healthy. Any suggestions anyone?
9133 2018-03-09 18:18:02 #Adani payback your 72000 Crore, We give better education to them.

9134 2018-03-09 18:17:58 dont use nail strengtheners longterm and use jaboba oil to help them grow
9135 2018-03-09 18:17:37 You got that right! Putin is behind this. Putin is selling NK oil and dotard does/says NOTHING. If this meeting does take place, I'm sure dotard will have another secret meeting with Putin.
9136 2018-03-09 18:17:36 About the same amount that the oil industry has paid you in recent years. 8.7million$ Mr. #PublicEnemyNo2 for all these schools, are you serious?
9137 2018-03-09 18:17:34 ahh, you've discovered the delights of the east coast mainline when the oil workers are on it
9138 2018-03-09 18:17:07 Fine, let's just buy all our oil from Saudi.. Just have to wait for the tanker to show up, take that Alberta. I don't care if they bomb Yemen I don't want that dirty ab oil eww

9156 2018-03-09 18:15:10 Um, Venezuela also has oil, Sweden isn't falling apart, and what's wrong with Denmark and Finland?

9160 2018-03-09 18:14:46 Saudi Arabia’s wells and finances are about to go dry. They’ve used oil money for terrorism which will all cease 
9161 2018-03-09 18:14:38 to protect your pillowcase and to avoid getting the oil all over your face (breakouts can happen from face/hair products on an unwashed pillowcase). In the morning, rinse the oil out, then apply conditioner, massage it in like you would shampoo, and rinse out well. Air dry.
9162 2018-03-09 18:14:36 The economy is doing well. Why mess with it with tariff changes? Louisiana supported you in the election, but steel & aluminum tariffs will hurt the Louisiana economy which is already hurting from decline in oil & gas prices. Is this how you reward your friends?
9163 2018-03-09 18:14:27 Kenya is a private limited company that does business with multinationals and other foreign entities.Even Rex Tillerson visit is just part of business of oil.
9164 2018-03-09 18:14:26 Hey you, yea you. Check your ar's oil. it might be lower than you think.
9165 2018-03-09 18:14:14 Diluted bitumen is about to have secondary refinement in Canada and there is already an new refinery that does that in Alberta. The ship traffic has already increased in coal shipments, but no protests there. If Alberta turns of the tap BC has to import oil via tankers. #NoLogic
9166 2018-03-09 18:14:13 Been looking for my card all week, I go get my oil changed today and they find it on the engine. Wtf do I be doing.
9167 2018-03-09 18:14:13 My parents do this, but with coconut oil, and it's actually kinda good? If you use an immersion blender it gets super frothy and comes out like a coconut latte. Apparently the fat makes your body metabolize the caffeine more steadily so it lasts longer.
9168 2018-03-09 18:14:08 Of course the big oil companies are in favor of Trump's offshore drilling plan...more money for THEM. 
Plus, they don't give a damn about our environment. Neither does the Trump Regime. Trump figures, "hey, as long as the drilling is not in my own backyard"

9169 2018-03-09 18:14:02 Cavlo Nero, black kale so yummy roasted with a bit of olive oil.  Just like crispy seaweed
9170 2018-03-09 18:13:58 Oil burn.  That's a bad thing.  Apparently.
9171 2018-03-09 18:13:44 Oilers respond quickly. Semeniuk makes it 3-3.
9172 2018-03-09 18:13:44 im sitting in walmart about to bust out a laptop and loiter for two hours in the little restaurant type area while waiting for my oil to get changed
9173 2018-03-09 18:13:42 Let’s keep the Central Valley (they feed people and produce oil) and San Diego so we have a Pacific port. Then, yeah!
9174 2018-03-09 18:13:28 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
9175 2018-03-09 18:13:28 $70 on an oil change someone please write SUCKER across my forehead
9176 2018-03-09 18:12:49 I don't care. There's no amount of money that is going to fix our planet if we destroy it. You can't drink oil. Maybe rich people will be able to go to a new planet, but we can't. This is just fucking wrong.
9177 2018-03-09 18:12:48 @BioOilUS y’all should sponsor me since I use your product religiously lmao. Send me a lifetime supply of Bio Oil 
9178 2018-03-09 18:12:43 Rinse your hair, whatever products are in there, use conditioner to get them out, not shampoo. Rinse the conditioner out really well. Then pat it mostly dry, put the oil in your hands and rub through hair, ends first. Bun it up and wrap it with a handkerchief/wrap,
9179 2018-03-09 18:12:42 I remember Obama gave our oil rigs away, when do we get those back?
9180 2018-03-09 18:12:36 @CertasBusiness, you have yet AGAIN let us down with your shoddy customer service & planning. We have no heating oil. Second day of NO delivery. Thank you VERY much.
9181 2018-03-09 18:12:32 Banking system is of still vulnerable. 
The reasons behind Russia’s banking system troubles includes trendy of rapid expansion through acquisitions; International sanctions of US and EU sanctions; Sharp decline in oil prices; Ruble devaluation
9182 2018-03-09 18:12:31 England has enormous reserves of coal but is not going to mine them.... and oil is slowly going the same way...the most expensive to extract is going to stop being extracted first... as for wind..well England and Wales do have wind ..............
9183 2018-03-09 18:12:29 Thanks for the reminder !! Will let them know I want drilling. American energy and oil means jobs, prosperity, and freedom.
9184 2018-03-09 18:12:25 The only reason Kim is at table is Vlad told him no more oil unless he obeys and Traitor Trump will be there because he always obeys Vlad.
9185 2018-03-09 18:12:10 Reminder to Going For The 3rd  to implement the 16 point punishment imposed by the FA. The deadline is 13:30 Saturday, 10 March 2018.

9186 2018-03-09 18:12:02 If you get gorilla glue on your hands, or any type of glue for that matter, wash your hands in a mixture of cooking oil and salt.
9187 2018-03-09 18:12:01 Mix a little coconut oil into the castor oil and it's the best home hair deep conditioning mask EVER. (Leave in for an hour so with a hot towel before washing for maximum effect.)
9188 2018-03-09 18:11:52 Yes, the plug was damaged so hrs replaced that and bc I had a recent oil change just put in oil.
9189 2018-03-09 18:11:47 It also gets completely rid of dark under eye circles. Coconut oil is a true gift. 
9190 2018-03-09 18:11:39 Isn’t it “British Whisky” the supermarkets are calling it now?  You know, like the oil, the smoked salmon, Andy Murray...

I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of independence?
9191 2018-03-09 18:11:39 Bought an oil burner and I'm sleeping with aromatic candle tonight  feeling kaya

salt and pepper to simmer.
Brown lamb in olive oil, add to broth mix, add drippings, add 1 cubed large tomato.
9193 2018-03-09 18:11:33 Try making an indigo work with mustard oil!

9195 2018-03-09 18:11:25 How much will clean up of oil spills set us back? Where do we fish? What about businesses/property owners along the coasts? Why are we backtracking from renewable energy? Who makes the big money? BTW, the answer is: No drilling offshore!
9196 2018-03-09 18:11:24 I see you sell black seed oil as a supplement. No conflict of interest there! MD? What a crock!
9197 2018-03-09 18:11:20 Oil rig changes in key shale basins:

9202 2018-03-09 18:10:32 .@EPAScottPruitt @SecretaryZinke @realDonaldTrump are using the denial of climate change science to support justifing their focus on increasing coal/oil production/use and sale of taxpayer owned land to private corporations.
Their denial hurts us now and in the future.

9221 2018-03-09 18:08:06 AB has more leverage than BC.  AB may be landlocked but you think transport trucks/rail won't give them everything you mentioned???

9223 2018-03-09 18:07:56 Another inaccuracy. The slipperiness is not so much caused by oil but by the residue of tyres as they wear down. A fine dust which lifts in rain
9224 2018-03-09 18:07:53 ha like i dont know that they signed a secret treaty with big oil
9225 2018-03-09 18:07:43 Time for London to feel a sting. Turn off the oil. Declare UDI. Be prepared to fight for it.
9226 2018-03-09 18:07:41 PM Dr Keith Rowley has deferred questions in @TTParliament about new arrangements at Petrotrin, including the removal and remuneration of Senior VPs, to the Energy Minister, as soon as the board of the state oil company provides the relevant information.
9227 2018-03-09 18:07:39 Thanks for your feedback. We only use olive oil.
9228 2018-03-09 18:07:33 “We must know that the baptism of the Spirit immerses us into an intensity of zeal into the likeness of Jesus, to make us into pure, running metal, so hot for God that it travels like oil from vessel to vessel.” - Smith Wigglesworth

9230 2018-03-09 18:07:26 And the auto & oil industries continue this assault on society every chance they get (replacing electric buses with diesel and freight trains with trucking; drilling on public lands; massive suburban sprawl planned around single-occupancy vehicles instead of mass transit).
9231 2018-03-09 18:07:13 oh, well, if the oil companies say it it must be true
9232 2018-03-09 18:06:49 Alkaline water is snake oil why do people buy it???
9233 2018-03-09 18:06:49 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
9234 2018-03-09 18:06:44 Is he not looking for oil in Chad?  When i say many of these archaic men should not be ruling a country in 2018 he'll say there are old men everywhere. Oil that will lose relevance over time.

9369 2018-03-09 17:52:02 Well @Conservatives A leaked British diplomatic paper seen by the Guardian calls for a planned EU-Indonesia trade deal known as CEPA to “boost” palm oil production.
9370 2018-03-09 17:52:00 I don’t know if this is an issue to them. From the replies I have  received. They want no pipelines, no trucks, no rail the conclusion is no oil. Good luck. Kinder Morgan pipeline has been in existence since the fifties or forties.  Still the safest mode of transportation.
9371 2018-03-09 17:51:49 Oil and gas?
9372 2018-03-09 17:51:46 Jordan and I are so gay we are fighting about who is giving eachother a coconut oil backrub after work so this evening we are breaking out the tarp and the wrestling masks about it.
9373 2018-03-09 17:51:44 $900M for Research & Development for medicine Big Pharma won't touch ie, Cannabis Oil & Dichloroacetic Acid (DCA) these are medicines that aggressively fight cancer cells. I'd give it to the world for free.

9376 2018-03-09 17:51:26 You can't drill for oil if you don't have facilities on shore from which to stage. Simply put, don't give the oil companies the facilities that they need. Block them on land and at the coast. @realDonaldTrump #FirstMoron #LiarAndChief #DraftDodger #OrangeLiar #PTBarnum
9377 2018-03-09 17:51:20 to rub coconut oil on their face :p ( and I don’t mean shade! lol )

9381 2018-03-09 17:51:03 I’m from Hull. Thank u for doing this. People in Hull were lied to, made unrealizable promises by a bunch of Tory private schoolboys, & basically sold a load of snake oil. In fact, as u say, it’s ordinary working class folk from places like Hull who will suffer most from #Brexit
9382 2018-03-09 17:51:00 Now that I have completed the last oil of NY, titled 'Burger stalls’, I can now start to sort out the next work. I fancy maybe an oil of Gentleman’s Walk, Norwich and an acrylic of Ilam in Derbyshire. I will get them prepped next week

9385 2018-03-09 17:50:17 Not if you just use a hot cloth, I guess it also depends on how your skin reacts to different things. Theres pills, theres light masks, theres tools, and theres a bagillion face washes. I never understood having to moisturize if the whole point is to remove the oil and bacteria
9386 2018-03-09 17:50:10 In the B.o.B song "BoBiverse" he raps that "bones don't turn to oil". He's a flat Earth believer, right? Does this mean he also doesn't understand how oil forms over millions of years?

I'm not sure I can responsibly jam to his  anymore
9387 2018-03-09 17:50:07 coconut oil is just plant butter man why do people think it's some miracle thing this is a conspiracy and we're all sheep in it
9388 2018-03-09 17:50:07 @richardosman the steel drum as an instrument did not contain olive oil.. it's an instrument invented and developed in Trinidad and Tobago

9391 2018-03-09 17:49:41 A little more than 500 years back, European invaders invaded the North American Continent, killed thousand of its aboriginal population & took over their vast reserves of Oil, Bullion, Metals etc et . After that, they brought slaves from Africa & produced huge amounts of farm 1/2

9396 2018-03-09 17:49:17 The truth is in morning rush hour...its virtually none-existent.
Compared to when we had a full blown economy with people moving in everyday.
Now people are leaving everyday.
Nutley & cohorts are misleading everyone. 
Suddenly she's pro oil? 
Pro pipeline?
9397 2018-03-09 17:49:14 Oil in your own machine.
9398 2018-03-09 17:49:10 Organic popcorn kernels, canola oil + crushed kale chips & season to taste. Sooo good!

You wear chucks to work? We have casual Fridays.
9402 2018-03-09 17:48:59 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
9403 2018-03-09 17:48:58 Is this some kind of new collective amnesia or just wishful thinking?  The Snake Oil actually works! Praise Jesus...
9404 2018-03-09 17:48:58 Well with that being said...don’t come to the cookout looking for some chicken, oil or any of the sides. @_SimplyMei gets 2 plates since you’ve forfeited yours

Started cooking, got burned by accident 'cause my dog licked my feet and spooked me so I did the shimmy shimmy with hot oil. Now I'm done cooking and it tastes glorious. Excited.

9428 2018-03-09 17:45:34 He is a republican in most of his stances! Lets be real. Lowering taxes for rich, trying to dismantle programs aiding poor and disabled, allowing oil cos to dump toxins, obama put a ban on much of that as Gw and others were lax, the racial biases, bought of by nra! Like rubio

9437 2018-03-09 17:44:23 I'm actually starting to feel bad for Trump supporters. They were promised a first class ticket on the Trump Train, and what they got was nowhere to sit on an exploding oil car.
9438 2018-03-09 17:44:15 Agreed, time to invest aggressively in renewable energy generation. Significantly reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, strengthen infrastructure.
9439 2018-03-09 17:44:06 you can get the essential oils from dischem and the Jamaican black castor oil from clicks

9441 2018-03-09 17:44:02 again, policies today do not really mean they'll continue tomorrow, especially in weak state structures like oil producing Cs. 
All oil countries are talking abt diversification nowadays, as if it was a strategy discovered today. When prices increase nobody cares.
9442 2018-03-09 17:43:57 Deliverance starts with the victims. Pastors will pray and annoits you with 2l of anointing oil. But if your are not willing to let go of what's holding you . You will forever be a slave. Sometimes is not the deliverence that we need, but we need to separates our selves.

9444 2018-03-09 17:43:32 2014 was about jawboning Middle East violence disrupting supplies which never panned out..more like early 2017.. the 55 to 50 range  until it broke thru 50...similar approach to keep it above 60.
9445 2018-03-09 17:43:32 Since his trade to swift current he is 15-3, has a .922% sv percentage and a 2.4 gga. Which for the season puts him at 29-18, .911% sv and 2.80 gaa. Better numbers than Zach Fucale and very comparable to Eric Comrie. Button doesnt do his research before saying dumb shit.

9456 2018-03-09 17:42:04 @SecretaryPerry new energy realism?  That’s the stupidest thing I’ve heard all week and I read @realDonaldTrump tweets. The realism is that the @gop has been bought by coal and oil. You’re all sell outs.

9459 2018-03-09 17:41:36 How do I find out what kind of oil my car takes?

9472 2018-03-09 17:40:01 Actually Ian. Nukes or WMD had nothing to do with it. War was a perro currency war waged by Saddam when he started depositing his oil money (even with food for oil sanctions) into BNP in euros instead of the sacro sanctum petro dollars (4B). US had to keep hegemony.
9473 2018-03-09 17:39:59 Other than that: You do know that NK has a huge amount of rare earth elements which are required for all our modern tech? Seems like a legit reason to create nuclear deterrence. Just look how countrys with oil are being invaded. Rare earths are much more valuable in modern times
9474 2018-03-09 17:39:59 US gov intent on making US the number 1 producer & exporter of mfg/fake oil. This can only be achieved if US has complete unrestricted access to/supply of Canada's fresh water. This is why @realDonaldTrump is renegotiating NAFTA - take water for free in exchange for trade with US
9475 2018-03-09 17:39:57 Get a new cause...selling oil equates to working at a cigarette factory. Nice job selling death, pollution and cancer.

9492 2018-03-09 17:38:09 And Russia wants it’s own oil deposits to take precedent. The exact reason it annexed Crimea. Funny that.  Also. Assad and Putin are still murdering civilians. War crimes. Stop with the double standards
9493 2018-03-09 17:38:08 Wait... for all these years, I've avoided @McDonalds since NOTHING is vegan, but apparently the fries in Canada are because they phased out the beef tallow oil & milk ingredients in 2007 and now use vegetable based ingredients. Can anyone confirm???

9496 2018-03-09 17:37:49 @dstaples David I think it was you that asked whether we would still support the oil and why. here's the #1 answer on the board ..I'm glad I didn't miss a beat of it
9497 2018-03-09 17:37:43 Your skin is confused :( seriously try a facial oil! I’ve always had super dry skin, but also acne prone so I used products that stripped my skin cause I thought it would help the breakouts. It just made it worse & caused my skin to be oily, trying to compensate for moisture loss
9498 2018-03-09 17:37:42 Literally nothing unless they wanna go join the blue collar workers

9515 2018-03-09 17:34:50 3/ The NEB approval was scientifically flawed and supported by oil execs and stakeholders. There is NOTHING sophisticated about it, if anything it was fundamentally not sophisticated in any way. And no, things can not go on as normal. The phase out of oil for fuel has to happen
9516 2018-03-09 17:34:47 No gases, they haven't done fracking here yet. There is a nodding donkey oil thing about a mile away but you don't know it's there.
9517 2018-03-09 17:34:37 The answer is YES, King Faisal cut the oil back when the US and other western countries were supporting Israel against Palestine. 
What has Erdogan done to help them?????

9538 2018-03-09 17:31:58 The Boston Globe seems to think that it’s either build more pipelines and lock us into 40 more years of dirty gas or import foreign oil. I think the 2 choices really look more like this, and I want to know what do you think #RenewableEnergy #mapoli

- 2 Tbspn oil (sunflower usually tastes best, don't do olive)
- 3 Tbspn water.

Add ingredients in mug as listed, stir until consistency feels right

To get 3.5 tablespoons of coconut oil a day into your diet, you would need to take 49 softgel capsules of coconut oil.

9569 2018-03-09 17:28:27 I’m not really sure you have any idea what you are talking about. Oil prices dropped 50% in 2014 - $145 to $69 and then to $39 end of 2015 now back to $62. We are a leading producer of oil. Prices dropped cause we are producing 10M more barrels/day than in 2009.  <25% is imported

9642 2018-03-09 17:21:12 So far so good. Data played out and equities performed as expected. 

Key point is that vol is not good for oil right now. Higher Vol will lead to positioning reductions. Also the day isn’t over. Rig count comes out in 45 mins.
9643 2018-03-09 17:21:11 BHA, Good Morning cleanser, an emulsifying oil cleanser and a light moisturizer (might need another brand?)
9644 2018-03-09 17:21:11 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9645 2018-03-09 17:20:46 Normal Olive oil or extra virgin? Because kalau latter OI BAZIR T_T.

But even kalau former macam bazir sikit - olive oil not best with high temp frying sangat.

9656 2018-03-09 17:19:34 HM Revenue & Customs, showed exports contributed nearly £29 billion to Scotland’s economy in 2017. Almost half (49%) of that figure, £14.1bn, was made up of exports 2 the EU.  Globally, oil and gas was Scotland’s fastest-growing sector, rising by 46 per cent, or £2,695 million.

9708 2018-03-09 17:11:28 I suppose.

9770 2018-03-09 17:02:53 Who owns more body oil?
9771 2018-03-09 17:02:38 Good 10% correction in a structural bull market. Micros much better earning improving GST teething problems over, oil top done, good Rabi crop, valuation much reasonable , risk reward favourable, politics will trouble but Modi will hands down , more oppos unite better for Modi.
9772 2018-03-09 17:02:35 Nope, its a Canadian issue.  $2 a litre should not bother BC since they don't like oil.

9775 2018-03-09 17:02:12 water is not excuse to block oil use. Fresh water is easier to treat, but there is nothing that can get in water that cannot be purified to drink. Filtration is very old & reliable technology. You seem to be poorly educated.
9776 2018-03-09 17:01:58 iron bombs and napalm are cheaper ,this is the result of oil money extorted from the west over many years

We might also help ourselves to other resources but you’ll get a nice cut, & military support.

9784 2018-03-09 17:01:21 But bills are high because delivery is difficult.  We are at the end of the line for NG, more NG would HELP the environment - less use oil.  Your advice would lead to more coal and oil.  #Shortsighted
9785 2018-03-09 17:01:16 This is sad with a state that produces oil

9807 2018-03-09 16:58:50 I found that using a dremel tool with brass wire brush and tapmatic cutting oil was noticeably better than other things. Probably any oil would work, but it prevents brass from smearing off on the harder metal and also seems to speed gunk removal.

Also, the pipes are pressurized to prevent anything from gettin into the drinking water. Water can be purified of any kind of contaminate so the risk of oil contamination in

9815 2018-03-09 16:57:35 Lucero is the audio equivalent of craft moonshine and artisanal beard oil.  They’re a prescribed interest for people incapable of developing their own preferences.
9816 2018-03-09 16:57:34 I’m trying to heat up my spicy tolerance by using chili oil as much as I can on food. It’s... painful.

9819 2018-03-09 16:57:12 olive oil is made out of olives.
baby oil is made out of olives too.
9820 2018-03-09 16:57:01 Didn’t it kick off with Wilson devaluing the pound in 67? Admittedly we got sicker through the 70s but at the same time we joined the EEC the 1973 oil crisis hit which really didn’t help us. Come to think of it, neither did the unions after that.
9821 2018-03-09 16:57:00 I know the cheap Maruchan-type ramen has vegetable oil in the noodles for this reason. But I'm sure there have to be better options. Coconut oil was one that came to mind to me too.

But I'm only a part-time vegan (and plan on staying that way).
9822 2018-03-09 16:56:49 Coconut Oil works better than Butter for the intended effect. Moistens your lips too.
9823 2018-03-09 16:56:45 Why do you park in a driveway and drive in a parkway? Why does a ship carry cargo, and a car carry shipments? If corn oil comes from corn and olive oil comes from olives, where the heck does baby oil come from? If you choke a Smurf, what color does it turn?
9824 2018-03-09 16:56:39 So... you don't know the term "snake oil" then?
9825 2018-03-09 16:56:38 Wow - did that guy even take a breath while he was writing that? I saw a great thread on demand for heavy vs high API oil the US is exporting. Basically said the market is thin. I will find it. But so much misinformation and lack of industry knowledge on display...

9828 2018-03-09 16:56:14 So, if/WHEN you get the cans, chop up some tomatoes, jalapenos, and some yellow onion and cook them, in some oil, in a pan for a couple minutes till they look like a nice salsa. Then, add a can of the Duck Salsa, and maybe a can of water to the pan.

9908 2018-03-09 16:45:12 Rachel Dolezal is like the Buffalo Bill of blackness.

"It puts the coconut oil on it's skin..."
9909 2018-03-09 16:45:08 An oil tanker tipped over and spilt oil, you need to get up to speed with whats happening in your county...
9910 2018-03-09 16:45:03 What you’re doing here is called an appeal to authority. Like chemophobia, it is another tactic of snake oil salesmen trying to confuse people.
9911 2018-03-09 16:44:54 I’m a whole shea butter, coconut oil, black vanilla goddess, bitch.
9912 2018-03-09 16:44:45 Well interesting theory of course not because of pyramids but the Nazis  want to keep control of the Nikola Tesla UFO secrets they brought to  America 1945 by using the American Army to keep oil money flowing to aid  their free energy suppression and do casual UFO trips
9913 2018-03-09 16:44:37 I’ve been dabbing into the essential oil life.. idk if it actually works but I’m loving the smells and it’s making me happy 
9914 2018-03-09 16:44:36 Well interesting theory of course not because of pyramids but the Nazis want to keep control of the Nikola Tesla UFO secrets they brought to America 1945 by using the American Army to keep oil money flowing to aid their free energy suppression and do casual UFO trips
9915 2018-03-09 16:44:31 I wish I could leave my oil burners on when I’m not home but with my luck the whole building will be on fire 
9916 2018-03-09 16:44:28 Happy #freebiefriday!!!!  I’ve got FIVE bottles of DHC cleansing oil to give away to one lucky winner! #RT and #follow @DHCUK_Skincare to enter! #ShareTheLove
9917 2018-03-09 16:44:16 There are two pushback points on this. 1-at current production rates Saudi Arabia may very well run out of oil while MbS is King. I sure wouldn't want to be king when that happens & have done nothing about it 70 years prior when I knew it would happen. ...
9918 2018-03-09 16:43:55 duh... Moore's law perhaps also applies to oil&gas technology!
9919 2018-03-09 16:43:52  here. I think it may be in our national interest to let go of NAFTA. We have completed free trade in TPP, EU and Mexico. We are required to sell our oil(NAFTA) to US for $32/bar. US doesn’t need it, so exports it for world price. It will make things difficult, nonetheless.
9920 2018-03-09 16:43:50 Should #T1D specialist clinics move away from the car dealer model of annual inspection and oil change to a breakdown service responding rapidly to requests for help?

9927 2018-03-09 16:42:42 I need a heavy moisturizer oil for my hair now that it’s bleached blonde. It’s so dry no matter what I do. Any suggestions?
9928 2018-03-09 16:42:23 I gotta get my car inspected, get me my new sticker, also need an oil change. Wish I could do everything at one place
9929 2018-03-09 16:42:23 Boy, I hate getting my oil changed lol.
9930 2018-03-09 16:42:19 Lets take 70% of fields are discovered then. That means we have still to discover just under 50% of what we have already discovered. That untapped resource, plus what we have already have in reserves. The beauty of oil is you never really know. Good we don't rely on it
9931 2018-03-09 16:42:15 Yeah but like almond/silk milk is good and you can use it for cooking, butter that's made from vegetable oil, dark chocolate is good 
9932 2018-03-09 16:41:54 My accent is a mix of Lancashire, Yorkshire, with bits of the U S of A thrown in. ( I worked for several oil companies in the 60s), so i must offend quite a few people
9933 2018-03-09 16:41:53 Eat mostly high nutrient density and low caloric Whole Plant Foods and No added Sugar, Oil, Salt or Alcohol
9934 2018-03-09 16:41:52 Fabulous! I do love a nice body oil & a Rose scent is my favourite
9935 2018-03-09 16:41:40 Another reform #SaudiArabia fist ever Women Marathon organised today. They have realized very soon that selling oil will no more be the profitable Business. Cheers to women empowerment :)
9936 2018-03-09 16:41:40 For edibles yeah, I think to make honey oil would be difficult at home for vaping purposes and free of solvents like Isopropyl
9937 2018-03-09 16:41:20 An oil embargo plays to @RachelNotley reelection bid. 1) BC is seeking remedy thru the courts. 2) How will oil companies react to sitting on an inventory with limited pipeline & rail shipping options. 3) No discussion yet on civilian protests. Time to buy a #NissanLEAF #bcpoli
9938 2018-03-09 16:41:11 my favourite overpriced skin mist is just water, glycerin and squalane oil, shocker

9944 2018-03-09 16:40:17 Not if we only own 8% of the oil because we accept 8% of the debt as pointed out earlier in the Vienna convention.

9947 2018-03-09 16:40:10 -Shimmer/glitter is always nice. 
-to remove makeup you could use coconut oil and a makeup removing towel (it is just a microfiber towel that is reusable) 
-beware of blush (I’m not saying you shouldn’t use it, sometimes it can be PIGMENTED) 
-red lipstick rules
9948 2018-03-09 16:40:07 What a joke, oil and gas aren’t going anywhere, if we gave them up we’d be living in the 1800’s, any takers. Another delusional socialist
9949 2018-03-09 16:39:59 Living on top of DC's oil, always a cardinal sin which must be paid for!
9950 2018-03-09 16:39:43 they are gonna drill where the oil is........6.5%GPT in North Dakota Second on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s list of top crude oil-producing states
9951 2018-03-09 16:39:26 When we say every hedger and his cat are long oil, we have acknowledged something more than the average oil trader.
I feel that bias like the smell of a fart in an elevator.
9952 2018-03-09 16:39:20 Converting bae to coconut oil, FWM JUNIOR
9953 2018-03-09 16:39:19 Yeah that’s an issue you need to find someone who can process it for you once the plant has been harvested. You could buy a vacuum separator but I’m certain that they cost a ton o money. Oh the magic butter machine for 200$ makes coconut oil or butter for you no problem
9954 2018-03-09 16:39:17 Hey at least I got an oil change. Guess today wasn’t a complete waste 
9955 2018-03-09 16:39:11 Theres a girl in this class who doesnt believe that we can survive without oil and coal powered energy and the girl next to me was talking about how you can use multiple renewable resources to eventually eliminate the bad sources and the other girl rolled her eyes and I cant even
9956 2018-03-09 16:39:10 LOL! Yousimply don’t know anything! The USA crated ISIS why they destroyed Iraq and pulled out of Iraq without setting them up again! Libya was over how they were going to sell this oil!! Libya had nothing to do with terrorism. That was the most Progressive nation in Africa!

9959 2018-03-09 16:39:05 I know Ten nut taste like cod oil
9960 2018-03-09 16:38:50 You could argue lots of things, doesn't make em true, the point stands: Britain & US are the master, Saud the mere puppet. Oil wells drying up is somewhat of a distant fantasy and not really relevant to the point of contention you raised.
9961 2018-03-09 16:38:38 . That’s how taz was at one point. He used to refuse to touch his food until we put his special lil olive oil on it. Like my neega, u BEECH neega. Eat this damn food 
9962 2018-03-09 16:38:25 On behalf of mother jones, we fully support the making of oil through the usage of koala bears.
9963 2018-03-09 16:38:21 Tak tau lagi gila aku tgah shutdown ni.. wehh try lah oil n gas,,, antr resume je dulu kat klcc hahah
9964 2018-03-09 16:38:11 I can’t afford my meds to begin with, and that diluted out bullshit they sell at LPs (HC reg) is useless for anyone with any sort of tolerance let alone a high one. A typical LP bottle used for infusion at $70 is utterly useless unless I chug oil like water.
9965 2018-03-09 16:38:10 i bought lavender oil a couple of days ago and i thinkkkkk i got a little too excited with it
9966 2018-03-09 16:37:54 @RachelNotley Constrict oil supply to @Britishcolumbia. If they don't need pipelines, they don't need gasoline. Let us back our fellow Albertans the respect they deserve, while they can drive their solar powered EVs and horse carriages.
9967 2018-03-09 16:37:46 *drowns myself in eucalyptus oil*
9968 2018-03-09 16:37:44 Cute, but everyone here is discussing oil rigs and drilling all around the coasts of the US. Why? The US already supplies all they need, exports the surplus and exports all they import from Canada. Why drill? The potential for another disaster is high.

9971 2018-03-09 16:37:27 Suppressed fact: even in 2014 with Scottish oil at a peak the Scottish economy was only 15% dependent on oil - 85% on our many other assets. (Prosperous Norway was 25% dependent on oil). Now after a downturn oil prices are rising again - and Scotland still has its other assets.

I had lost all respect for Sagan ad a scientist ....  even before he predicted a global winter from the burning oil wells in Kuwait
9975 2018-03-09 16:37:06 Big shout out to the wrong number that called this morning and made sure I didn't sleep through my oil change appointment.

9977 2018-03-09 16:36:50 Look at @tulsaworld to see what happens to a city when the oil and gas industry leaves! Empty buildings, housing depressed, charitable giving down, etc... @OKStandard @okoil
9978 2018-03-09 16:36:41 I always go to this hole in the wall place in Watauga to get my oil changed bc it’s cheaper and the guy is really nice and I went today and he’s like “ooh you show up and youve got a new car and your Amex card”
I think I just got a hype man. Obviously picked the right place.
9979 2018-03-09 16:36:33 PM @JustinTrudeau asked about the latest in the BC vs Alberta dispute. Alberta threatening to shut down oil to BC. Trudeau talks about importance of the pipeline #cdnpoli

9986 2018-03-09 16:35:29 Focus on the West. I agree with Alberta turning down the oil shipments to BC. You can’t keep ignoring this situation.
9987 2018-03-09 16:34:58 @ChickfilA Is there a list of locations that do not cook in Peanut oil? (I know some stores use canola oil)

10002 2018-03-09 16:33:27 This really is a lot worse than we think.   I studied narcissism for years.  The first I heard tRump+scandal+oil I knew it was true, and bad.

10004 2018-03-09 16:33:12 Then stop buying their oil altogether. But you don't get to be taken seriously after saying that "Obama gave them pallets of cash." Because Obama didn't give them any cash, it was their money to begin with.
10005 2018-03-09 16:33:05 I think coconut oil is worth a try and you'll smell scrumptious

10023 2018-03-09 16:31:16 Grease Lightning from @lushcosmetics has worked wonders for my breakouts lately. It has tea tree oil in an aloe vera base, so it’s very calming.  You can also get a free sample at the store to try.
10024 2018-03-09 16:31:03 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
10025 2018-03-09 16:30:57 world leaders let me remind you when you are enjoying your 5 star meal some one around the world is getting killed in war and some country so poor that people eat mud chips. I dont see any policy good enough working other then going around finding oil

10031 2018-03-09 16:29:50 Yeah, depending on how the usual go (inventories, rig counts, etc.)  But we also have possible Iranian sanctions and also Venezuela oil sanctions as possibilities, all potentially coming at the same time as inventories are choked for the summer and drop like a hammer below 400!
