1 2018-08-06 23:59:40 Totally agree.If there was no need for oil, the middle east would be more of a wasteland that it is, all those people would have migrated to the west to make Agent Orange feel good . What @elonmusk has done for humanity is unprecedented. Electric cars, reusable rocket.

5 2018-08-06 23:59:26 I declare a new season of the Oil of Gods Favor is coming on you! I saw a simple vision of Fresh Oil like we read In Psalms 4:6 “ Many, LORD, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity ? “Let the light of your face shine on us.” There is New divine Fiancial favor! #Favor
6 2018-08-06 23:59:25 No they can’t.  Trudeau won’t allow our oil to be shared from west to east.  Trudeau forcing us to use Saudi blood oil as he punishes the west for voting against him.  Also, we need to ship Saudi oil by rail.  Not safe at all.
7 2018-08-06 23:59:24 Well my life is about to change. I’m finally getting in the oil field finally 
8 2018-08-06 23:59:24 You know what would be great, is if Republicans had the same anger and indignation against banks and oil companies that they do against Facebook and YouTube.
9 2018-08-06 23:59:20 Under @JustinTrudeau 's energy policy it is impossible to get any oil infrastructure built in Canada, also bakken oil by rail has already but down one Quebec town but whatevs...right Blair..?..

41 2018-08-06 23:57:41 Thousands would appreciate a job to go to but saying for example pipelines or climate protection is not necesary. The government already had the means to apply regulations on Oil companies. The more employees paying taxes the more money to be paid towards climate research.
42 2018-08-06 23:57:37 Our government doesn’t have the gonads to stop buying oil from the Saudis.
43 2018-08-06 23:57:26 Our dog was crate trained before we got her and it helps a lot with her separation anxiety. She used to cry when we would leave but she’s gotten to the point where she’s okay with it now. Sometimes I spray lavender oil on her crate too
44 2018-08-06 23:57:19 We were on our way to that same coal under Obama, then oil prices dropped due to over production.
45 2018-08-06 23:57:18 The worst oil outside of , hmm let me think. Get back to you
46 2018-08-06 23:57:15 What an idiotic nation. So lucky they got oil...
47 2018-08-06 23:57:13 So amusing. Out of the all the countries, Canada gets targeted.
48 2018-08-06 23:57:08 ん？「ちゃちゃいれマンデー」の時間帯？
49 2018-08-06 23:56:56 Yes, let's build export capacity to Asia, where refineries are not going to tool up to handle our low grade oil, to show we're mad at the people who don't sell us that much oil to begin with.

Or we could switch to electric vehicles.
50 2018-08-06 23:56:42 Um...@JustinTrudeau bought it at an over inflated price and construction of the twinning has ground to a virtual hault, also doesn't displace a single barrel of Saudi oil or meet any energy needs of eastern Canada...
51 2018-08-06 23:56:41 get some blotting sheets use em when you feel oily,, they dry up oil on your face and make you look less shiny 
52 2018-08-06 23:56:38 This is a good reason for countries to start using their own oil and no longer supporting terrorist regimes.
53 2018-08-06 23:56:38 More money than the snake oil salesman earned today. HA.
54 2018-08-06 23:56:36 Then it sounds like you're happy about the ban.

The fact of the matter is, even after a national tv interview with Megyn Kelly, Jones is still a snake oil salesman.

And the majority of the people of this country don't want that poison.

And the companies know that.
55 2018-08-06 23:56:28 Chinese skipped perhaps 50 yrs of R&D investment costs/ time by stealing U.S tech for decades. Research Universities have been infested with them. There has been a sympathy and perception of innocence for Chinese they have exploited and abused for sometime.

58 2018-08-06 23:56:21 Bombs Over Venezuela: Oil Prices Expected to RISE

Venezuela is falling apart. Two decades of socialist politics dating back to the election of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in 1998 have sent the economy into a tailspin.

61 2018-08-06 23:56:13 Cutting back substantially on the use of oil and gas would practically solve the global warming problem. Louis XIV said 'after me the big flood' (apres moi le deluge'). Yeah,  behaves like Louis XIV.
62 2018-08-06 23:56:11 Alex Jones is basically the snake oil salesman who showed up in a covered wagon to give the locals a little show before taking their money for useless patent medicines. Except now, he can reach millions of people. Who knew there were so many rubes in the modern world?

5) Take more photos buying peaches 
10) ignore real issues
75 2018-08-06 23:54:43 All PMs who avoided forced nationalism are responsible for Saudi oil hitting those refineries

79 2018-08-06 23:54:08 @stphnmaher please explain further. Trump had no issues with Canada before we responded to the US Tariffs on steel and aluminum. Canada as petroleum reserves as large as Saudi Arabia in the oil sands and is one of the largest producer of hydro-electrcity which we sell to US.
80 2018-08-06 23:54:04 Who takes black seed oil daily? What benefits have you noticed?
81 2018-08-06 23:53:50 caramel frappe, strawberry banana flavored cbd vape oil, and a blunt?? i love  spending money that i need to save
82 2018-08-06 23:53:41 Canada has proven they're not to be bought by Saudi oil. Saudi Arabia on the other hand did a stupid decision, now everybody knows about them jailing activists. They'll probably pay journals money to cover everything up.
83 2018-08-06 23:53:39 Thought businesses could discriminate against whom ever they please?

90 2018-08-06 23:53:02 That's swell, Bobby- now go find one.  Tesla is a tax-credit fraud pretending to be an auto company- hell, even THEY admit they aren't a car company!   Big Oil LOVES EV- ya know why, Bobby?  Cause electricity doesn't come from your wall.  Wake up.
91 2018-08-06 23:53:00 “1 Million people were dumb enough to subscribe to a blowhard that is only out to sell you the newest snake oil.”
92 2018-08-06 23:52:56 Those are already exist so they are straw men just like Bill Mazeroski is for baseball HOF. Yet leveraged #ETFs more likely to face more not less regulation. But underlying oil and nat gas market not questioned for manipulation.
93 2018-08-06 23:52:54 Wasn’t much oil. I was cooking on a pretty flat cast iron. I should have known. Pork chops turned out tits though

95 2018-08-06 23:52:35 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
96 2018-08-06 23:52:12 when I visited Italy the one that always drove me crazy was Acetto, which against all odds isn't oil (aceite in Spanish) but vinegar!
97 2018-08-06 23:51:54 Socialism is the best SMDH this country has more oil than any other country and still are poor except the leaders

102 2018-08-06 23:51:13 Does bio oil work on black people skin
103 2018-08-06 23:51:06 And tar sands oil needs a coker.
104 2018-08-06 23:50:50 What is very bad oil?
105 2018-08-06 23:50:36 Well this was my first time and I spent close to two hrs trying to figure it out. Had time to teach my three year old how to say oil.  Kept the bad words to a minimum.
106 2018-08-06 23:50:30 Always use oil gel , entry oil gel so good
107 2018-08-06 23:50:28 I’m p sure that me exploding an entire bottle of lavender essential oil on myself in the middle of Target today was God’s way of telling me to chill the fuck out....
108 2018-08-06 23:50:26 Only 10% of the oil imports comes from them and I’m sure the other country’s we buy from will be happy to make up the difference. Also, I’m pretty sure we don’t import sand, so I’m sure we’ll be ok. #EnergyEast
109 2018-08-06 23:50:20 My sister had advanced scoliosis and our family who at the time were poverty stricken were led astray by what i know now to basically be a snake oil salesmen. My sister almost died but luckily real doctors saved her.
110 2018-08-06 23:50:16 I think so. I usually only get better with antibiotics so if you can see a doctor I recommend it. Otherwise I bet some oil people can hook you up with stuff to sniff.

116 2018-08-06 23:48:59 Oil sands processing super expensive no? Whereas Saudi just dig the ground and stuff flow out with minimal effort haha
117 2018-08-06 23:48:59 Why, do you understand how the Iran deal works in the middle east.  LOOK up where oil needs to go to reach US refineries. Not a slam just asking for more details or are you a Trump Parrot?
118 2018-08-06 23:48:41 Saudi Arabia and Russia fund almost 100% of their expenses with crude oil.
119 2018-08-06 23:48:37 And now Irving cannot make that investment since Ottawa killed the west-east pipeline. Saudi Arabia is cancelling investment deals with Canada and we will continue buying unethical Saudi oil because Ottawa blocked Energy East. Nice work Trudeau Liberals.
120 2018-08-06 23:48:37 The egg roll I just ate was literally dripping in oil
121 2018-08-06 23:48:22 Wolves are also an important part of many ecosystems.  Oil and gas interests as well as many ranchers don't have a history of caring about those either.
122 2018-08-06 23:48:00 These kids need oil in them hips
123 2018-08-06 23:47:46 I was thinking that too. Couldn’t I just replace the 1/3 cup oil with a 1/3 cup applesauce? I usually replace it in my recipes.

126 2018-08-06 23:47:13 Don't you just like the smell of coconut oil
127 2018-08-06 23:47:06 I guess the Kingdom doesn't realize that Canada is oil self sufficient and is a much bigger economy. What a stupid leader.
128 2018-08-06 23:46:46 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
129 2018-08-06 23:46:45 Two bottles of snake oil and one water diviner thanks.
130 2018-08-06 23:46:41 Didn’t work for Bell. The US has interests in Saudi oil and protecting it, nothing else. I don’t know anything of a secret air base but the US military presence prior to Iraq invading Kuwait was very small. Should a threat happen again the US military would respond.
131 2018-08-06 23:46:40 I have lived in Canada for two years, and I have never seen any Canadian supporting the Natives, or complaining about the Dirty Oil, or Taxes, or HealthCare, or Homeless ppl. I have a mother and sisters and they have better lives than Canadians by far.
132 2018-08-06 23:46:31 If what you're doing is wrong... if you think you're above any other human being...if you think that oil gives you power...if you think money is everything...if you think a God gave you rights...YOU are an idiot! Thank you CANADA for standing up! #GoCanada
133 2018-08-06 23:46:28 @mmhui63 Michael, last thing - one of the dominant fundamental drivers of oil price over next 6-12 mos. will be if/how Iran sanctions are resolved. If Trump somehow gets Iran to chill, and in turn relieves sanctions, we could have a lot more supply on our hands.
134 2018-08-06 23:46:20 We have the oil. Build the pipelines. We don’t need this.

I can't remember if it was White Lily or Gold Medal Flour that I fried the first chicken I killed with the purple hull peas I had?

141 2018-08-06 23:45:39 “Now the oil refineries belong to me. Only me. And another thing. You’re all fired.”
142 2018-08-06 23:45:18 Saudi Arabia is ruled by one family. If you don't belong to the family or suck  dick of a family member then you're out of luck. They are rich beyond rich because of oil. And everybody bows down to them because they need oil. Canada doesn't need your oil. So fuck off.
143 2018-08-06 23:45:16 Wait until Saudia Cancels all Oil to Canada.
144 2018-08-06 23:45:14 And killing Energy East pipeline means this business decision cannot easily change as Irving Oil cannot swap unethical Saudi oil for ethical Canadian oil. Nice work Ottawa.
145 2018-08-06 23:45:12 This is so sad
Alexa, nationalize the Ploiesti oil fields
146 2018-08-06 23:45:12 When YouTube for example enhanced its machine learning sex education channels, prank channels, LGBT and even left learning channels got hit. CBD oil channels and Crypto channels.

It wasn’t a conspiracy against one political ideology.

Robots don’t care about us like that...
147 2018-08-06 23:45:11 Bruh I gotta get in shape if I’m tryna get back in the oil field
148 2018-08-06 23:45:10 You're right that most of us won't be happy about but this Tory government would sell its own grandparents for some of that said oil money

151 2018-08-06 23:44:54 i don't think i was supposed to go thru that weed oil that fast
152 2018-08-06 23:44:53 It’s almost like they don’t really have any principles. 
153 2018-08-06 23:44:53 Saudi Arabia is the top polluter..
Attacking Canadian Oil, is like picking on the smallest of the pack!

155 2018-08-06 23:44:41 Hey Amy, let me know where to send you a Crotch Guard Anti-Chafing Skin Care Oil Free sample.
156 2018-08-06 23:44:29 So I opened my hood today to check my oil levels and guess what’s just chilled there.. A MOUSE WHAT THE HELL. IM SO CONFUSED
157 2018-08-06 23:44:28 Perhaps the KSA will force us to do something that we could never do ourselves? Use our own goddamn oil.
158 2018-08-06 23:44:24 Good! As they should be.  There is no reason for oil riggers.  Push for green green.
159 2018-08-06 23:44:11 What body oil do u use sis
160 2018-08-06 23:44:07 Iran's oil reserves are larger than Saudi's. So,...kinda makes ya' wonder...don't it?!  Is that loan to Saudi going to based on 'sentiment' or 'boots on the ground' or 'fission agreements'. No matter FT's timely 'spec sheet' the people throughout the region will suffer.
161 2018-08-06 23:43:59 えー！ナゾトレの方が見たい！こうやって視聴者置いてきぼりにするのね！
162 2018-08-06 23:43:55 I wouldn't bet on oil being the reason Trump won't criticize Saudi Arabia. They are a strong arm absolute power regime carrying out a repressive action on cititizens who dared question them. Trump LOVES that! He doesn't need oil as a reason. "Toughness" is enough!
163 2018-08-06 23:43:54 my stomach hurts and idk why but I’m p sure succing CBD oil from the dropper like mother’s milk isn’t gonna help
164 2018-08-06 23:43:46 ......... i didnt realize ppl have olive oil sitting in their houses.............. wtf
165 2018-08-06 23:43:44 I read a Porsche Cayman's first oil change at the dealer was $310, and the person supplied the oil! Porsche requires them to let the oil drain for a full hour.
166 2018-08-06 23:43:43 My point, @JustinTrudeau 's energy policy makes it impossible to build oil infrastructure in Canada...just easier to support Saudi Arabia...suckers...
167 2018-08-06 23:43:30 Ate a whole pineapple, now i have my feet in clary sage oil, i have been bouncing on my gym ball, if i dont go into labour tonight im never having another baby again 
168 2018-08-06 23:43:22 Ban Saudi oil.
169 2018-08-06 23:43:15 Fuckim, snake oil salesmen should be run out of town on a rail
170 2018-08-06 23:43:10 HAIR TIP:
Back 2 School styles can be maintained by adding leave-in conditioner  or light oil to dry hair, wrapping hair with satin scarf/bonnet at night, and keeping your hands out of it.
171 2018-08-06 23:43:08 @Inspiralized Somewhere today I saw a cucumber, sesame oil salad - can't find it now but I just wanted to add fresh mint from my patio!
172 2018-08-06 23:43:06 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil •

174 2018-08-06 23:42:45 I’m getting an oil change and “Sweet Dreams” is playing @solly143. I wanna die lmfao
175 2018-08-06 23:42:42 Does anyone know what kind of oil goes in an outside home generator?
176 2018-08-06 23:42:41 I'm in charge now: let's sell the strategic oil reserve to the Iranians. I'll get a good price!
177 2018-08-06 23:42:32 @UniversalPics I "rang'?the neck,snapped it?and cut and scald or scald and cut?
tore the feathers,cleaned,laid salt and then turned on the oil on,but I can't remember if it was White Lily or Gold Medal Flour that I fried the first chicken I killed with the purple hull peas I had?
178 2018-08-06 23:42:27 There were no oil spots in the parking lot.
179 2018-08-06 23:42:23 I for one, would love to see a new all American EV Co succeed in the face of so much negativity from big auto and big oil analaysts, such as #LarryFossi at Rahr among many others. Why you are all so excited to see @elonmusk fail, is a bit mind boggling impo
180 2018-08-06 23:42:05 don't tell Marco Rubio--he's convinced that with the backing of the casino bosses, oil traffickers, evangelical prophets, private prison industry titans and used car dealers, he's going to pick up the pieces of the party when Trump goes to prison.
181 2018-08-06 23:42:03 Nice analysis by my friend Jay Hakes. Worked with us on Oil Spill Commission.
182 2018-08-06 23:42:02 All I wanted today was an oil change at 11:30 and here we are at damn near 8pm still working on it.
183 2018-08-06 23:42:02 He purposely misleads and instill fear and hate into viewers who aren’t as astute as you are. A lot of his fans are deluded and angry because of him, this not entertainment. It’s immoral to deceive the vulnerable to sell snake oil.
184 2018-08-06 23:41:43 Screw Saudi Arabia. We shouldn't be involved with them in any way. They are a terrorist nation. When dependence on oil ends they will be a poverty stricken third world country. What will drive their economy...sand?
185 2018-08-06 23:41:40 Snake oil, bee venom and spearmint, best muscle pain reliever ever.
186 2018-08-06 23:41:21 Sorry, I can't tonight, I have to ban anchoring in straits of mackinac after oil line dented
187 2018-08-06 23:41:14 Please stop sending oil too. Thanks! Much appreciated!
188 2018-08-06 23:41:08 Turned that shit to baby oil
189 2018-08-06 23:41:00 Continuing to burn coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is like rolling up car windows on a hot summer day.

191 2018-08-06 23:40:44 How'd that pied piper strategy work out for you?  What about the rigged primaries with the superdelegates?  You rigged an election towards a candidate who was so corrupt, so toxic, that you couldn't even beat a demagogue  reality TV host who used snake oil salesman tactics.

195 2018-08-06 23:40:16 Yeah, foolish of us to build infrastructure in Canada that benefits Canadians when we can import light oil from Saudi Arabia that benefits the house of Saud...
196 2018-08-06 23:40:10 And now I’m just laying here tweeting my life away because I have no energy to get up and oil my ashy ass
197 2018-08-06 23:40:03 For tar sands bitumen they would require an upgrader. Who told us that was Irving Oil.
198 2018-08-06 23:40:02 @realDonaldTrump America spends billions defending Saudis from Iran for the sake of global economy oil supply. America is spending money to loose business as they could easily make up much of any potential shortfall.

And whilst protecting human rights abusers.

202 2018-08-06 23:39:35 Which do u like better, separating kids from families, keeping them in cages, giving them drugs, or sexually molesting them?

Killing thousands by taking away health care or by removing clean water and clean air protections? 

Tax cuts for the super rich or for oil companies?
203 2018-08-06 23:39:25 Castor oil!!! @Ambuler_ can prove it too
204 2018-08-06 23:39:24 lol he's hiding lol oil imports are going dry soon. Mr Trudeau knows he's upset some people he can't exactly outspend, fight, or run from but hey lol. You guys haven't figured it out yet

tore the feathers,cleaned, laid salt and then turned the oil on, but I can't remember if it was White Lilly or Gold Medal Flour that I fried the first chicken I killed with the purple hull peas I had?
206 2018-08-06 23:38:52 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
207 2018-08-06 23:38:44 The guy is a loon...
That being said. Censorship? That is more dangerous than the loon.
If ppl aren't smart enough to recognize snake oil salesmen... It's on them.
208 2018-08-06 23:38:32 Massive game changer. It would solve our oil, energy and debt-related problems over-night, practically. It will also make Pakistan an exporter of oil, when currently 85% of Pakistan's oil is imported. I have put the country on close watch and have already shifted some funds

216 2018-08-06 23:38:02 Oil money do wonders.....don't you see they've every nation to attack Yemen in some capacity just by throwing money around.
    Their God is money so they follow it and serve it.
217 2018-08-06 23:38:00 The SA government has not been transparent regarding its oil reserves.  One would think that's because they're running low.
218 2018-08-06 23:37:58 Just think you'll do a telethon like those televangelists and the dupes who buy your lead tainted snake oil will just give you money. I mean you're a leach so you may as well just panhandle anyway.
219 2018-08-06 23:37:55 That is a pretty good flick.
220 2018-08-06 23:37:43 I could lose a leg and my mom would try to fix it by diffusing essential oil. Told me to bathe in honey today for a few mosquito bites I’m done Ma

222 2018-08-06 23:37:37 Also regarding Japan. ..

They are very innovative,  robotics,  they also produce the highest quality steel on earth. I think the USA is more focused today on micro steel plants with many robotics incorporated into design. Especially tubing 4 natural gas/oil industry ..
223 2018-08-06 23:37:34 Its no big secret whose funding the fight against Canadian Oil.
224 2018-08-06 23:37:23 Alex Jones is a modern day snake oil salesman and a liar
225 2018-08-06 23:37:21 I hate how long it takes new oil to get hot... I just wanna fry some chicken & go to bed 
226 2018-08-06 23:37:19 And if Canada were oil independent as we should be, we wouldn’t have to worry about Saudi threats now would we?
227 2018-08-06 23:37:17 Really..?..Do you think it's a level playing field when Alberta oil infrastructure is subject to up and downstream emissions consideration and Saudi oil is not..?..
228 2018-08-06 23:37:10 I would say dependency on oil. Cuba is much more diversified in its economy.
229 2018-08-06 23:37:03 What was in the tanker as gas o oil will not make this size crater??
230 2018-08-06 23:36:50 Yes, maybe Liberals will finally see reason and support Canadian oil over oil coming from the Middle East.
231 2018-08-06 23:36:21 The U.S., Russia, and China need to call a truce and join together to fuck Saudi Arabia and Qatar up. They could split the oil three ways.
232 2018-08-06 23:36:17 #SaudiArabia we don't need your oil........and we have plenty of sand, so....... we need nothing from you, bye.
233 2018-08-06 23:35:59 I just explained.. Because of the decline in price of crude world wide, this administration had to take off the oil subsidy if only it can generate what it needs to keep the country moving.
234 2018-08-06 23:35:58 Your laws are unjust, uncivilized, barbaric & inhumane! SA is a nation of elitists! It uses ppl from other nations to line the bloody pockets of Arab Sheiks! I pray that your wells run dry or a MODERN DAY PROPHET OF SCIENCE & HUMANITY comes up with a renewable source of crude oil
235 2018-08-06 23:35:45 And this "transfer money to the rest of the world" is even more nuts. That's exactly what we had been doing, importing oil. Conservation and renewable energy SAVE MONEY. But killing our solar industry lets China catch up.

242 2018-08-06 23:34:51 I spilled my hair oil everywhere. Oh I’m mad.
243 2018-08-06 23:34:43 Thanks for the feedback Tom!  Our Coconut Mouthwash is based off the ancient technique of Oil Pulling which is good for gum health & teeth whitening hence the oily texture. But totally get what you mean!

251 2018-08-06 23:33:29 We don’t import ‘Saudi oil’. We import cheapest light oil that’s already on a boat. Not dilbit because Quebec refineries can’t take it. Also, line 9 was reversed to supply those refineries, but that’s with Bakken because... not dilbit. Start building refineries in Fort Mac now.

258 2018-08-06 23:32:07 And if you factor in externalities—spill clean up, loss of hurricane-limiting wetlands etc.—I think we’re all paying much more to keep oil afloat in those states. 
Absolutely right on the electoral point, of course.

260 2018-08-06 23:31:36 as a Canadian I stand with human rights for all , for too long the Saudi government has exploited foreign workers and little to no right for woman.

285 2018-08-06 23:29:03 Canada imports 11% of its oil from SA.  Have some backbone and buy it somewhere else. The plane heading toward the CN is a veiled threat, what they really think of us. Guess all Justina's money to the Middle East was a waste.  LMAO
286 2018-08-06 23:29:01 Since they nationalised their oil industry and took control of production; 1973 or thereabouts.
287 2018-08-06 23:28:59 Use clove oil! Put some on a cotton ball and put it on the gum of the tooth that’s hurting- it tastes nasty but works!
288 2018-08-06 23:28:59 Alberta and the oil industry spreading lies again.
289 2018-08-06 23:28:47 Its not easy when climate change is at the Brink and begging for mercy from the most ruthless blood thirsty carpet baggers.There is only so much snake oil we can take anymore.
290 2018-08-06 23:28:44 The @JustinTrudeau  government required consideration of upstream and downstream co2 emissions for Energy East, Saudi oil faces no such scrutiny..will it now..?..
291 2018-08-06 23:28:43 As well as Saudi could leave Canada severe poverty and drought when oil supplies are cut off by Saudi Govt as King Faisal did with US, UK and others in 1973!
You are a real Arabian and u should be aware of this story.
292 2018-08-06 23:28:24 What’s keeping you from trying C.B.D. oil?
293 2018-08-06 23:28:24 Hence the huge $ discount on usa purchase of oil sands oil  and lack of world exports. Its tar and not easily processed
294 2018-08-06 23:28:01 Inspired by @BrowofJustice I decided to bake today and thought I’d do a play by play. But all you’d hear is-
Dammit forgot to preheat oven
Dammit dogs get out from underneath my feet
Dammit where did I put the lid to the oil
Omg brown sugar is so delish, gonna eat the whole bag
295 2018-08-06 23:27:55 I have to get an oil change without my dad taking me by the hand  I don’t like this adult stuff haha
296 2018-08-06 23:27:48 Barrel of crude was roughly $130-115 and when PMB came to power, it dropped to $39-40. Let’s not forget that at that time, our foreign reserve was not more than $45B and when the price crashed it dropped to less than $29B. Crude oil generates over 90% of our revenue

298 2018-08-06 23:27:40 The only way I can cook anything is by putting olive oil and parsley on it but tbh it hasn't led me wrong yet

5- laugh the evilest laugh I can muster as she slips away in

6-have an air bag at the bottom so I can do it all over
300 2018-08-06 23:27:31 On and off for about 2 years. It helps my hair grow fast. I cut my hair short when I get bored with it and whenever I decide to grow it back I use the oil. It even helps grow eyebrows. A guy friend even used it for his beard (all recommended usage on the bottle).
301 2018-08-06 23:27:22 Cut ties. We don’t need them or their oil.
302 2018-08-06 23:27:18 everything in nashville is covered in peanut oil.

304 2018-08-06 23:27:01 Bf did my oil change, put air in my tires, washed n vacuumed my car. I offered to help & he said “no bby, I’m your man, I’m supposed to do stuff like this. I’m here to take care of you” 
omfg yesss boo, let me take care of you in the back seat real quicklol
305 2018-08-06 23:26:55 Ah yes, the tyranny of private businesses to do whatever the hell they want. I hear some private businesses sell snake oil under the guise of supplements.
306 2018-08-06 23:26:48 So much better! Ditched most of my skincare routine for squalane oil, a Sebamed moisturizer, Micellar water, a Japanese sunscreen, and Stridex.

Most of my persistent bumps are already gone and it's getting better every day

313 2018-08-06 23:25:34 Its more than fluoride its aluminum, chlorine, pestisides, mercury, lead, poison, uranium, toxic waste, arsenic, copper, fertilizer, oil, rocket fuel, Sodium silicofluoride, Calcium hydroxide, Aluminium sulphate, Liquified chlorine, Fluorosilicic acid, Trihalomethanes and more.

315 2018-08-06 23:25:19 now you know they think a few Americans are dumb or they really are. BTW, they can just tax gasoline.
316 2018-08-06 23:25:17 Cbd oil for my anxiety is a game changer. As long as there’s little to no thc in it(for me personally) I find high thc can trigger my panic attacks so I usually opt for low dose thc/high cbd strains of medicinal marijuana and oils.
317 2018-08-06 23:25:00 I use olive oil and a little salt, pepper, and grill mates Montreal steak
318 2018-08-06 23:24:59 Only thing your capable of is terrorism. Without all that oil money,  you're absolutely nothing.  The oil will eventually be gone. Tick tick
319 2018-08-06 23:24:59 Because light sweet crude is needed for gasoline. Importing will never stop. Oil sands is good for petro chem products or diesel not gas
320 2018-08-06 23:24:53 High key so glad Yennhi bought me an oil diffuser for Christmas. Cause I can feel like my life is somewhat together
321 2018-08-06 23:24:52 Ya well we will get the money back. Canada and USA has more oil then Saudi. We are just using yours up first.

338 2018-08-06 23:22:44 I don’t see anyone thinking it would make good sense to invest billions into a pipeline so that we can replace Saudi oil with Canadian oil anytime we have a tiff with that country.

374 2018-08-06 23:18:34 Note how @RealDonad_Trump ‘s Muslim ban does not include Saudi Arabia- despite the 911 hijackers being from there and their human rights record. Their oil is too important. Proving it’s not about terrorism- just Islamophobia & pandering to Trump’s racist base.
375 2018-08-06 23:18:32 Yes it will do I normally do a marinade of olive oil, turmeric, ginger, pepper and paprika on chicken and salmon very nice. Also look out for turmeric teas. Pukka and twinning make them
376 2018-08-06 23:18:27 For the record.  I would've rather been drunk.  Just thought I would put that out there.  Oh, and I didn't take his advice about using CBD oil.
377 2018-08-06 23:18:26 I had this idea of using giant sponges to soak up the oil in the Gulf of Mexico during the BP oil spill. That wasn’t a possible solution, either.
378 2018-08-06 23:18:17 Who cares about camel riding, goat fucking bedouins.  They are protected by Trump & their oil money. Canada made the right decision.

385 2018-08-06 23:17:18 I don’t care about #obamagate. I’m telling you that renewable energy is the future. Fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas will deplete. Wind, water and sun energy is the future. Hell, for that matter we can harness energy from driving on the road. I’ve seen it.
386 2018-08-06 23:17:16 You are correct, this wouldn't happen. Dallas coaches have a tendency to "love their guys" and both Charles Tapper/Randy Gregory have massive upside potential that could be realized. Don't forget Jerry is an old oil man, he loves the discovery of a glory hole.

In context of GW, it doesn’t matter in what direction Norway produced fossil fuel’s money is going.

What does matter, in which planet they (Norway produced oil & gas) willl be burned.

Norway is #2 producer of natural gas (per capita) and #5 of oil.

398 2018-08-06 23:16:26 There’s a peppermint oil version of wasp killer (w/ the all-important jet spray) if you want to use natural chemicals. I don’t know how effective it is. If you’re worried about affecting pleasant Hymenoptera pals, it may be worth a try. But whatever you do, do it at a distance.
399 2018-08-06 23:16:17 That's because oil and gas companies make way more than middle class Americans.  You can't give a middle class American a $14,000,000,000 tax cut when they don't come anywhere close to making $14,000,000,000 to begin with.

409 2018-08-06 23:15:53 I've been accused of getting my information from Info Wars probably 100x.  The only thing I know about Info Wars is my daughter's friend's father told me in a drunken convo, I was sober only because I was sick, something about CBD oil and he coupled it with Info Wars.

415 2018-08-06 23:14:52 They have likely missed massive amounts of oil and gas. And coal.

418 2018-08-06 23:14:24 I put so much castor oil on my edges that it’s dripping onto my forehead lol
419 2018-08-06 23:14:13 All that oil money that the Saudi royalty spend on lavish opulence belongs to the people of SA. Royalty is not necessary for social order and economy.
420 2018-08-06 23:14:09 someone needs to oil that megaphone, its making a squeaking screetchy sound.
421 2018-08-06 23:14:06 Consequences you lead tainted snake oil salesman
422 2018-08-06 23:14:00 He's clearly high from all the fumes he's huffing at his oil change factory
423 2018-08-06 23:13:52 Baked salmon with olive oil, garlic, basil, parsley and lemon.  It was what I had for lunch.  Yum!!!
424 2018-08-06 23:13:52 The reef is important

But we don't know what this deal is for exactly

The big oil bods on the board aren't exactly about reducing emissions that contribute to sea temps rising. How are they going to stop the bleaching, or is that not on the agenda?

#reefgate
425 2018-08-06 23:13:32 So that you can sit on it and grease it with your oil of Israel 
426 2018-08-06 23:13:23 The @Valvoline Instant Oil Change technician said he's unable to do an oil change without me giving them PII, so I elected to take my cat elsewhere. It's not like I'm buying something dangerous like explosives or Sudafed.
427 2018-08-06 23:13:19 楽しそう(*´꒳`*)
428 2018-08-06 23:13:07 There’s nothing more frustrating than waiting for an important email and seeing: 
• Groupon
• Groupon 
• Groupon 
• Groupon
• Groupon 
• Groupon 
97 times in a row...I guess that’s what I get for wanting 78¢ off an oil change one time 3 years ago.
429 2018-08-06 23:13:01 Fresh mobile 1 oil change for the si, and regular high mileage for the wago lol
430 2018-08-06 23:12:46 Jadi semalem tuh pikiran banyak skip hal. Habis first cleansing langsung lanjut toner. 

Habis toner langsung face oil. 

Untung paginya ngga ada jerawat numbuh.
431 2018-08-06 23:12:38 Experts say that record heat waves globally is not an accident:
Yet the U.S. 45th regime must destroy public confidence and restrict government employees speech about climate change, restrict fuel efficiency policies and now artificially inflate oil prices.GREAT. #tytlive
432 2018-08-06 23:12:38 Times that I felt the best I was taking multivitamins and cod liver oil but it was in conjunction with regular exercise and a sleep schedule.
433 2018-08-06 23:12:32 Tbf. Persians used to be pretty cool. Before the Mohammedan crazies took over.
And the fall of the Ottoman Empire after WWI, oil, and the cold war fucked the ME. 

Imagine what all that tyranny and a shedload of war does to a people. Then add religion. Obvious outcome really.
434 2018-08-06 23:12:30 Oil. The universal language of power. Saudi helicopter pilots train on Sunshine Coast. What could possibly go wrong from the land that spawned Bin Laden and is now buying nuclear technology from Israel?
435 2018-08-06 23:12:27 Yes, you were clear on that point. I was only trying to look a bit past the obvious and point out the reason we are so incredibly dependent on the oil and gas industries has much less to do with need and more to do with these industries using their influence to keep us dependent.
436 2018-08-06 23:12:21 I need somebody to put some oil through these parts like right now
437 2018-08-06 23:12:18 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
438 2018-08-06 23:12:11 Um, he threatened Merkel because of US oil interests. It has nothing to do with his personal feelings about Putin. Man, people think of foreign policy as if it's fucking highschool. #tytlive
439 2018-08-06 23:12:10 Happy birthday @SimplyRisque 
Continue having sense me pretty love.
May the Lord bless you and grease your paths with His oil of richness and abundant grace... 
Have a beautiful day baby... All me love. 
440 2018-08-06 23:12:07 Rohoani no angel, but hundred times better than Wahabi double speaking Saudi regime. Why not be concerned about Saudi regime. Because oil lobby and Israeli lobby can manipulate saudis, but not Iranis
441 2018-08-06 23:11:58 Didn’t POTUS just say he asked SA if they could cut reduction recently?  was this just easy way of doing just that and perhaps but more pressure on Soy boy to use our own oil or the US. And get off his ass and get to work on a deal?? Just sayin.
442 2018-08-06 23:11:54 Frying plantain with palm oil > groundnut oil
443 2018-08-06 23:11:51 You know we live in a global world ?!
How exactly did Saudi Arabia get rich?!? From the sales of oil to the global world ...
It's okay not to have diplomatic relations with countries that threaten security.
But you do not have to curse everyone
444 2018-08-06 23:11:46 Seemed like a good random mancave type thing to have. Besides, I imagine the smell would be an awful mix of motor oil and little Cesar pizza
445 2018-08-06 23:11:37 Venezuela's economy was fucked up by the govt even before any sanction. Besides, there aren't any sanction on oil. Venezuela buys and sell oil to U.S.
Please, stop praising socialism. I'm living through this shit and i just wanna fucking die.
446 2018-08-06 23:11:36 ''You three, be quiet and come help me carry all this Oil and Cement.''
447 2018-08-06 23:11:35 I mean ideally we’d be reducing our oil consumption...but in the meantime good idea!
448 2018-08-06 23:11:28 It was  Olive oil that used a lead pipe to break the check book
449 2018-08-06 23:11:22 Saudi Arabia is also committing a genocide in Yemen, stones LGBT people  to death, flogs women for getting raped, and is the head of the UN Human Rights Committee advisory board (Oil money buys influence).  It's a monarchy in the 21st century.  One of the worst places on earth.
450 2018-08-06 23:11:06 Manafort helped the Pro-Putin leader of the Ukraine who was ousted by pro-EU & U.S. Leadership in the Ukraine. Putin needed the Crimea 4 Russia's Oil Pipeline which Manafort  & Trump R involved with.
451 2018-08-06 23:11:01 3 kids' favorite things from #GenCon2018:

Carrie: Taking part in the cosplay parade. 
Evie: Hanging out at the bar with the DCC crowd on Saturday night.
Cooper: The sword fighting tournaments in Lucas Oil Field
452 2018-08-06 23:10:54 The balance in overnight trading fell on the right side of the line. Shares and oil rose, bonds markets marked time and the US dollar strengthened @MicMcCarthy_CMC
453 2018-08-06 23:10:54 Eating healthy fats like grass fed butter, avocados and coconut oil, will keep you satisfied to help you avoid the urge to binge on sweets
454 2018-08-06 23:10:50 Boycott Shell oil.
455 2018-08-06 23:10:42 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
456 2018-08-06 23:10:33 I will bet you a gallon of motor oil and two tickets to the Dixie chicks.
457 2018-08-06 23:10:31 You want to show your support to LGBTQ2 ? Show us, Immediately cut all funds and oil transfers from Saudi Arabia into Canada. #MAKETHEMFEELTHEPAIN
458 2018-08-06 23:10:23 So,they kicked out our ambassador because he was standing up for women's rights. And,@JustinTrudeau&the ISIS @liberal_party are encouraging Islams to come to Canada &treat women as the Saudis do. Keep your oil you bunch of Neanderthals.Canadian women don't want your kind here!
459 2018-08-06 23:10:22 Consequences you lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist
460 2018-08-06 23:10:20 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
461 2018-08-06 23:10:17 I’m so excited for my chocolate MCT oil powder I cannot contain myself. I guess this is what adulthood is
462 2018-08-06 23:10:12 Knowledgeable ppl and other world leaders thought the Iran deal was just fine-much better than what we have with N. Korea (which is NOTHING). Many of us wonder what oil lobby has been persuading DJT to aggravate Iran. Did they get to you too?
463 2018-08-06 23:10:09 Time to cover oil interests in Middle East, of Rothschild/Murdoch and that ilk
464 2018-08-06 23:10:02 Or you can do what your FB readers suggest and ask her about George Soros, open borders and unimpeded illegal immigration, disrespect of law enforcement, and socialism. AKA the make-believe bogeymen that conservative snake oil salesmen are peddling to their listeners these days.
465 2018-08-06 23:09:54 Sitting at this oil change is taking forever... Holy crap.
466 2018-08-06 23:09:52 What real action can #Canada take against #KSA he is not going to stop their oil from eastern refinerys and I susoect they already have the recipe for poutine
467 2018-08-06 23:09:34 Witch hazel +  oil
468 2018-08-06 23:09:34 I guessed Russia in better position to withstand any insane neocon sanctions because unlike China she dumped all US debt, did not borrow and does not need to borrow with high oil prices economic growth of 1,5%, ruble may fall 5-15% maximum acc to Moody's or negligible effect
469 2018-08-06 23:09:29 So good. 
Needed for a true italian sandwich along with salami capicola and imported ham.
Some oil n vinegar and some pickled hot peppers n pickles.

Shit, I'm hungry.

Fuck you thread.
470 2018-08-06 23:09:29 If China doesn't want our Oil.  We have enough oil for the whole world.
471 2018-08-06 23:09:23 Venezuela was also a coffee (and cacao) exporter before the oil discoveries. So what might have been Colombia's disadvantage relative to Venezuela? Colombia's coffee regions located more inland and away from the Caribbean coast? (This would then be a simple gravity model issue?)
472 2018-08-06 23:09:20 I’m in.
473 2018-08-06 23:09:20 Agree . Never been a fan of Alex, I think he's a snake oil salesman but where does it stop! Who gets to be the judge of what's acceptable or not. It's a fine line and very dangerous. Free speech means free speech for all, period.
474 2018-08-06 23:09:18 Since when do you give a shit about the environment?
You have rolled back EPA laws that protected us from toxic poisons all so your cronies in dying energy industries will keep throwing money at the campaign you've never stopped....You're like a traveling snake oil salesman 
475 2018-08-06 23:09:09 Haha yes i have seen this document, i believe this doesn't include any oil revenue contribution either. Its just so ridiculous, some people really need to get a proper education, its embarrassing
476 2018-08-06 23:09:04 Saudi need US much more than they need Canada. No slight to Canada, just US consumption of Saudi oil is much more valuable.
477 2018-08-06 23:09:04 You are a terrorist nation. You treat women and non Arabs like dirt. When the world's reliance on oil ends in the near future you will be an insignificant 3rd world nation.
478 2018-08-06 23:09:02 Same here, and just to make a buck. Modern day snake oil salesman.

481 2018-08-06 23:08:39 Being unreligious is actually the favor of God. Fresh anointing oil is the least religious thing you'll ever encounter in your entire life! 
482 2018-08-06 23:08:27 first day trying thc oil with my food. I think this is gonna be my go-to for pain management, bc the bruise in my cheek has been bless all day, and I haven’t felt any psychoactive effects so far.
483 2018-08-06 23:08:24 this bullshit ass free vacation that isn’t even free kind of sucks but at least I don’t have to pay for oil changes anytime soon
484 2018-08-06 23:08:23 It sure as Hell isn't fueled by the snake oil supplements he and his minions shill for.....
485 2018-08-06 23:08:22 Canada can cut trade ties with Saudi Arabia and continue to do just fine. 

Canada has oil, water, wheat, minerals, skilled workers and everything else needed to be self sufficient. 

Can Saudi Arabia say the same?
486 2018-08-06 23:08:20 she went Brazy on the coconut oil init?
487 2018-08-06 23:08:17 The money supports the economies of those countries. Mexico relies on the remittances that come into their economy: it is more money than their oil industry contributes to their economy.

490 2018-08-06 23:08:09 Labor induction - where’s the essential oil for that? *inbox explodes* #butseriously #youcouldsellme
491 2018-08-06 23:08:03 Shia -Sunni hate, Islamic society ‘s inabilities to reach a consensus with modernity, west’s dirty deals for oil/ energy security ; complex Israel/Palestine issue, Wahabi fanaticism and Israeli lobby in USA make it difficult to know truth. But Iran will gain by opening up more.
492 2018-08-06 23:07:57 死んじゃう
493 2018-08-06 23:07:50 Omg with that chili pepper oil that all pizza restaurants have there
494 2018-08-06 23:07:48 If anything this is rallying the entire country around Saudi Arabia. The whole 9/11 tweet brought alot of attention and that was just an hour ago.

You have to remember the US is trying to become a major energy exporter of oil now, so be careful attacking their allies.
495 2018-08-06 23:07:46 #tytlive there is a 3rd win for oil: the trade war is driving down the Canadian dollar making the oilsands cheaper to extract.
496 2018-08-06 23:07:41 Oil money
497 2018-08-06 23:07:40 Getting multivitamins and CBD oil for marathon training
498 2018-08-06 23:07:37 Love how you hacks hate consequences, especially when you constantly beat the drum of self responsibility. He knew what he is doing, just another gross snake oil salesman and performance artist acting like he is a martyr. He knows conservatives are dupes and are easy marks.
499 2018-08-06 23:07:36 One of the biggest drivers for Putin to keep Assad in power is Russia’s Naval port and Air based in Syria.
Other ones are:
- to destabilize the are for oil price
- to make a big mess to stop any new natural gas pipeline plans from Persian Gulf to Turkey and to Europe.
500 2018-08-06 23:07:26 BUT let's sell them weapons and buy their oil. Too bad there's no pipeline from Alberta to Maritimes .
501 2018-08-06 23:07:23 Sounds to me that Oil companies have more of an influence on Trump then Mother Russia #tytlive
502 2018-08-06 23:07:22 Yeah, we do, have had for a long time. How do you propose we move it around given #CaptainCrayon has virtually shut down all domestic oil distribution?
503 2018-08-06 23:07:20 Disgrace of the western freedom&democracy.
Horrific human rights abuses in #Saudi wahhabia but the neocons don't call for "regime change".
But my guess, when their oil & gas will dry out,those Arab nomads will b thrown in a bin of garbage of Humanity.
No orher use of them,but oil

507 2018-08-06 23:06:51 Again, the original tweet was not for you but newsflash guy, most upper class city kids voted for the private prison / big pharma / corporate oil stooge, TPP / NAFTA loving, coup organizer, refugee deporter Hillary Clinton, and they still act like she is god's gift to this world.
508 2018-08-06 23:06:34 So this is what you report on ?????? Not the economy, unemployment rate, jobs added, manufacturing/oil-gas-coal resurgence, countries willing to renegotiate trade deals. What a bunch of losers .... you guys are Americans .... right??????
509 2018-08-06 23:06:26 Fun night making ESSENTIAL OIL BRACELETS.   So many choices!!  Aromatherapy and Friendtherapy!!
#wehaveanoilforthat #GQrally #craftnight #summerfun #ameo #lifestylemedicine
510 2018-08-06 23:06:06 This stupid light in in my car. It’s just an oil change. Don’t panic 
511 2018-08-06 23:06:02 He’s a snake oil salesmen of the worst kind, playing off of people’s fears
512 2018-08-06 23:06:02 Eating a lot of popcorn?  I make the best. Only use yellow Jolly Time, cover the bottom of the pan with olive oil, put 3 kernels in the pot, cover. When the 3 kernels pop, add the amount of popcorn you want & cover, no shaking. When you can count to 3 between pops its done.
513 2018-08-06 23:05:58 Punkin Butt teething oil, teething mitten, amber necklace. I was not prepared for teething to start at 2.5 months and his first teeth to pop at 4 months. Haakaa if you don’t already have one.
514 2018-08-06 23:05:38 Nothing like a 150$ oil change
515 2018-08-06 23:05:34 There ought to be a line of manly scent colognes among which would be campfire, woodshop, gasoline/motor oil, and fresh cut grass. #randomideas
516 2018-08-06 23:05:33 The Kingdom of #Saudi_Arabia granted $60 million worth of oil derivatives per month to power plants in #Yemen to operate 24/7 to alleviate the suffering caused to the Brotherly Yemeni people by Iranian-backed Houthi militias’ practices
517 2018-08-06 23:05:21 So, it turns out that students are their #1 exports.  Cause doesn’t really need their oil.
518 2018-08-06 23:05:21 When you are a miner or an oil company man ..why would you say anything different
519 2018-08-06 23:05:21 @MuskElton Mr. Musk I present you a challenge. Zero foot print, Zero waste.
 In return I hope I have awakened your grey cells, on an idea of a new (really a very old) technology that has been waiting to be implemented, without oil, gas or nuclear power plants.
520 2018-08-06 23:05:18 How slimy and sleazy is Gene Smith? Like a snake dipped in oil on a slippin slide full of gak in a thunderstorm of McDonald's grease.
521 2018-08-06 23:05:08 Thats what happens when you disrespect a secular society on social media. Freeland shoulda thought that one out more. Only good thing is now those stupid shits in E. Canada have no where else to get their oil- Energy East looking pretty good now, eh Quebec??
522 2018-08-06 23:05:04 I'm used to it now too but it still no fun haha. Have you tried cbd oil? It really works well and it doesnt have any side effects. I take mine in 15mg pills atm.

525 2018-08-06 23:04:51 Canada imports almost 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia and sell them arms. Yet the Libtards try and score cheap political points by virtue signaling and framing themselves as holier than thou defenders of human rights. Do they honestly think people are that dumb?
526 2018-08-06 23:04:46 When Russia took Crimea and Donbas, they effectively took:
- Crimean oil and huge gas fields
- Ukraine’s coal areas
- Ukraine’s viable fracking areas
- nothing else
Russia already had Sevastopol. They didn’t need to take it. All the BS about helping Russian people is just BS.
527 2018-08-06 23:04:45 With this spat with #KSA it would be a good time for #Greenpeace to jump on the unethical oil we import from them stopping the flow...yes? No?
528 2018-08-06 23:04:36 CBD oil makes your skin super soft!!!! Fucking use that shit!!!
529 2018-08-06 23:04:33 This @RealAlexJones ban is seriously going to hamper his placebo pill business. Oh well. Good riddance to this snake oil salesman.
530 2018-08-06 23:04:27 changing my oil: 

Mechanic: You don’t haul ass in this thing or rev the engine a bunch do you? 
Me: of course not, I’m a mature adult, not a child. 
Mechanic: a/c good? You don’t freeze it?
Me: I always keep it at the same temp 
Mechanic: which is? 
Me: ....69
531 2018-08-06 23:04:27 Perhaps we should reconsider buying Saudi oil and focus on Alberta oil. Canada East
532 2018-08-06 23:04:13 Blanche green beans, shave up some courgettes, add some olive oil and some sorta vinegar, and pine nuts in lieu of a bit of cheese, and voila. It’s pretty great when you’re hot and don’t really want to eat x
533 2018-08-06 23:04:05 Hahaha not after that tweet. Saudi Arabia is going to end up like egypt / afghanistan.

Torn down in the name of people's rights and freedoms as a cover to nationalize the nations oil reserves.

Plus announcing a nuclear program if Iran chases one makes it an even better target.
534 2018-08-06 23:04:00 I don't see what leverage Saudi has. Canada neither needs camels or oil..
535 2018-08-06 23:03:44 あと3日楽しみです
536 2018-08-06 23:03:42 "But I got somethin' better. Baby oil. Black Market, baby oil."
537 2018-08-06 23:03:31 Oil change. Lunch with dad. New debit card. Renewed license. Now to pamper myself with a fill. What a productive ass one day off.
538 2018-08-06 23:03:26 “It’s simple,” She snaps, flour, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and water appearing on the counter in front of her. 

“You take all of these ingredients and combine them, to make enough batter for roughly .. hm. 72 cupcakes?”
539 2018-08-06 23:03:12 Tonight I made fried potatoes and onions with nutmeg. V tasty. Cut potatoes in 1/2" pieces, 1/8" thick, onions 1/4". Season with salt and pepper, cover, cook on low in a bit of oil for ~10-15 min, turn up heat and brown everything, add nutmeg. Simple and effective.
540 2018-08-06 23:03:10 I had the mango habanero wings the day I got my membranes stripped...also bounced on a ball and had sex...she was born the next day lol. But I also took castor oil. DONT do that

545 2018-08-06 23:02:40 Canada doesn't have the geopolitical power to threaten the way the US can. But Canada can stop buying Saudi oil, freeze them out diplomatically, LOUDLY take up the cause of imprisoned Saudi dissidents, and use the expression 'Sharia dictatorship' at every opportunity.
546 2018-08-06 23:02:40 Switzerland is the ultimate Model. Every Citizen is encouraged to carry.
547 2018-08-06 23:02:32 For some insane reason, the US loves the KSA.

It's probably the oil?
548 2018-08-06 23:02:18 Come on Gronk, have you ever noticed how much oil travels by rail.  Not to worry, Trudeau will buy it from Iran.
549 2018-08-06 23:02:12 Well, with their women able to drive, Saudi Arabia will have need for their oil. Shame they are lacking in the refining end of things.
550 2018-08-06 23:02:08 Propaganda.... first off  Hardly trades with  (27 in the world)
East Gets 6-9% of oil from SA easy to cover..  Sits on the 3rd largest reserve remember..as for military deal.. meh.. drop in the GDP bucket... besides where else will SA get their wheat?
551 2018-08-06 23:02:05 Meanwhile in Europe, clean energy investments on the rise as Trump tries to push coal & oil. Coal miners lungs are black & and they die, nobody wants to buy polluting inefficient products that release toxic gases into the atmosphere and cost more. Yes Trump is winning. Puke

557 2018-08-06 23:01:48 I’m going to move to an abandoned oil rig in the ocean. Just me, a lifetime supply of soylent, and a desalinator with googly eyes on it. The desalinator will be named Oblomov.
558 2018-08-06 23:01:46 All I did today was stare at oil, walk away for a snack, miss my short entry, and then be mad at myself the rest of the day. AMA. #OOTT #CL_F $USO
559 2018-08-06 23:01:45 Hilarious. When did you become an expert Donnie? What you know about environmental issues you can write on the head of a pin and the people you appoint to the EPA are there solely to promote the coal, oil and gas industries. You suck. #FakePresident #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica
560 2018-08-06 23:01:36 I wasn't talking to you but wow, Obama created some "protected land", made toxic drilling and pipelines go anywhere else, and made an ineffective climate agreement. Yeah Clinton's assertion to give miners clean energy jobs was not going to be affected by her corporate oil donors.
561 2018-08-06 23:01:34 Will never understand everyone's hate for #oklahoma oil and gas...they #GPT tax does their fair share every year!!!! #okleg
562 2018-08-06 23:01:31 As I said last year: probably need to put away the anointing oil (as Bill Parcells said).
563 2018-08-06 23:01:23 the olive oil mayo is gas

566 2018-08-06 23:00:51 Much better for the country to sell our oil than use it ourselves. Sure, everybody wants a subsidy, but we are a trading nation that thrives on the revenue from our exports.
567 2018-08-06 23:00:51 You’re a snake oil salesman yet I’ve yet to see the government restrict your speech rights

570 2018-08-06 23:00:31 Lol good idea! I’m definitely not against cbd oil by any means but I don’t find it necessary to post videos of putting it on your tongue daily. There’s other ways to market your product and draw people’s attention.
571 2018-08-06 23:00:28 I was raised in Benghazi but that doesn’t make me an expert on the Libyan oil fields.
572 2018-08-06 23:00:24 “You” are a business that violated the terms of service of a company that you do business with. Play by the rules next time. Or get a megaphone and stand on a street corner with the other snake oil salesmen.
573 2018-08-06 23:00:20 I don't know why all this spasm against Saudi Arabia?
Is your breast in Qatar the reason?
Don't forget that 10% of the import of crude oil in Canada is from the Saudi market, and many other factors will affect Canada
574 2018-08-06 23:00:18 Coconut oil, aloe vera and tea tree oil
575 2018-08-06 23:00:08 Seeing what Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money is making me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil..

577 2018-08-06 22:59:52 I don't support racists, nazis, snake oil salesmen, hateful street preachers, people claiming that lemon juice will cure cancer, etc.  I do however like them to speak openly in the public because then you can slap their ideas down.  Debate demolishes these ideas, not censorship.

581 2018-08-06 22:59:19 I was washing my face and i got tea tree oil in my eye. I looked up at the mirror and thought rip to da gal you used to see.
582 2018-08-06 22:59:17 Also stop buying their oil!!!  That should have happened a long time ago.
583 2018-08-06 22:59:00 And we enable these Neaderthals by buying their oil
584 2018-08-06 22:58:35 Well Justin's foreign policies are going to cost Quebec big time.... Start looking to where your oil and gas is going to come from now.... Maybe Quebec will wake up now when their car gas skyrockets at the pump lol
585 2018-08-06 22:58:30 Agree completely!! Completely. Now can you get back to getting our oil to tidewater. How's that file progressing?
586 2018-08-06 22:58:11 That’s the thing. He isn’t insane, it’s a character he acts out for his simple followers in order to sell his Snake oil pills & potions. His ex wife confirmed this.

588 2018-08-06 22:58:08 @cigarbanter I broke out my box of these last week for company. The wrapper has a beautiful oil and there is a peppery taste to the blend that reminds me of some of the more intense habano blends out there yet it's more subtle and refined.
589 2018-08-06 22:58:04 There’s probably GOLD under them there trees! Or oil. Or coal. Waste of space them trees.
590 2018-08-06 22:58:01 Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. That’s how we become Kings and queens.
591 2018-08-06 22:57:57 But here is the fact, I've had good experience and bad experience during my short stay in the north. But the positives far overshadowed the negatives.

It's been a worthy sojourn here
592 2018-08-06 22:57:53 My American friends =Canada is Farmers/Oil/Gold/Silver/Resources = the mindset of "ALL OF US" = shoot 1st  & ask questions later = enter my home?  = it is all over.

You won't hear about #Yemen: 

-Hillary, media co-conspirator, sold $100B of weapons to the Saudis.
-Corporate media and arms manufacturers/dealers don't want attention upon it
-Saudis are "allies" because oil. 

Money comes first. War is money.
594 2018-08-06 22:57:34 Yet, we now produce more oil than them. Same with Canada.

597 2018-08-06 22:57:14 So I tried a new Keto hamburger recipe with baked portabella mushroom tops as the buns and it was amazing. Gonna try them fried next tike (almond flour, fried in coconut oil)
598 2018-08-06 22:57:12 Canada is self sufficient we have all necessary resources and don’t need to buy Saudi oil when we have our own.

601 2018-08-06 22:56:54 I got a turkey sub with provolone, spinach, tomatoes, banana peppers, and a little bit of mayo. The oil & vinegar set it off
602 2018-08-06 22:56:47 My summer tan strategy is to wait until August, go to the beach one time, lather in oil and end up looking like a lobster!! Quality tan right there #nolobsteremoji #someonefixthat #upsetmillenial
603 2018-08-06 22:56:41 Baby oil works wonders
604 2018-08-06 22:56:41 Descent countries and people’s should leave the corrupt #UN joke, instead of dancing to the Arab oil. #KSA is a country with the Stone Age laws, they should be shunned but we are bowing to them!

607 2018-08-06 22:56:15 As for the girls , there are too many pretty ones that everyone of them deserves miss world. However, I was told it won't be easy to marry one as non-native.
608 2018-08-06 22:55:39 Then you must be perfectly fine with the decisions of the Canadian consumers to choose to import foreign oil.
609 2018-08-06 22:55:38 Think of the children and ALL of the innocents, Then........ You don’t have to touch...... Isn’t Coconut Oil good for the hands?
610 2018-08-06 22:55:29 Certain it drives @realDonaldTrump  crazy that we have this in the USA. Certain he will do his best to make a huge difference.
611 2018-08-06 22:55:26 Foster Fritz has been Big Money donor to radical conservative agenda for a long time. Buyer Beware of this carpetbag,snake oil huckster.

613 2018-08-06 22:54:59 I've seen some people talk about using coconut oil as a replacement for sunscreen and I'm just like I can feel the sunburn already
614 2018-08-06 22:54:33 tea tree oil
615 2018-08-06 22:54:32 It’s fall so it’s time for goat’s milk soap & coconut oil.
616 2018-08-06 22:54:16 Is 20 years old too old to go to the grocery store with your mom? Bc if I don’t she’ll come home with coconut oil, some shaved almonds, garlic, lemonade mix, sliced cheese, and 5 useless seasonings. Not a single thing to make a meal out of. Shit all I need is some Mac n cheese
617 2018-08-06 22:54:04 Reading this while I heat up my oil rig was fucking hilarious. I hope you, your 55 followers, your 4 month old account, and your profile pic from google have a wonderful day
618 2018-08-06 22:54:03 Oil massage ended up by fingering that slut
619 2018-08-06 22:53:48 Also, situation re Iran is complex. Bibi and KSA both pushing Trump hard on this (as they did Obama), US keen to payback for their humiliation in Syria (tackling Russia not really an option), also US shale co could really do with a lift in oil prices...
620 2018-08-06 22:53:38 Not just China. The US as well. It's using its USD hegemony and punishing the EU for getting its oil from Iran. Look at its NOOPEC+ strategy today. the US is now a rogue nation.
621 2018-08-06 22:53:35 If I have to watch one more video of a stranger or friend dropping cbd oil under their nasty tongue I swear to god. Do what you do, but nobody cares and nobody wants to see the inside of your slimy mouth.

625 2018-08-06 22:53:06 They're trying everything they know . Thinking these giant fans strung across the continent are going to matter . That goes for both parties. Oil is into everything , buying it all up.
626 2018-08-06 22:52:55 Coconut oil is so so cursed. Stop using it. For your hair, on your skin, on your face, ESPECIALLY AS A LUBE DEAR GOD. Just stop. At BEST cook with it but even then there are better oils. Spare yourself. Wow I hate it. Disgusting
627 2018-08-06 22:52:51 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics--all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain the best conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces--the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
628 2018-08-06 22:52:35 The few northerners I've dealt with in business are really transparent and straightforward. I was sceptical before dealing with them but they cleared my doubt with positive ethic and consideration.
629 2018-08-06 22:52:25 Nope, no flue guard, annular space around flue not built up, no oil isolation at property,  no oil filter on oil line.  10mm oil pipes bent badly in boiler casing, 3mm air adjuster on airbox rounded, boiler oversized
630 2018-08-06 22:52:22 Screw Saudi Arabia ! Canada does NOT need them! If it wasn’t for their oil they would be a third world country!

640 2018-08-06 22:51:16 He’s not much different from Drumpf in terms of being a snake oil salesman. He lost all credibility when he waited as long as he could before opening his facilities for Houston flood victims last year.

644 2018-08-06 22:50:49 I would feel less bad about it if he didn't spend the majority of his show trying to sell snake oil supplements to people.
645 2018-08-06 22:50:36 Maybe you should brush up on Anti Trust laws. Ma Bell was a private company, too. Vertical integration in the oil industry is prohibited. I could go on about monopoluzation, but why. Alex Jones is a nut, IMO, but no one's targeting, and thus demonetizing, leftist nuts.
646 2018-08-06 22:50:34 Except we are in deep with Saudi oil. We don’t care about human rights. We allow for abuses as long as our pockets a lined with the liquid gold. Our foreign involvement needs to be redefined.

The same Ethiopia is also planning to export oil out of Somali Galbeed. These people need to wake up lol.
650 2018-08-06 22:50:18 I’m pro Canadian pipeline.  Importing oil is ridiculous but the economic factors of students getting ripped out of a system over tweets seems harsh and will have a negative effect on us.  I just want to make sure a move this impactful is worth it

661 2018-08-06 22:49:17 Probably not. All dependent on high oil prices.
662 2018-08-06 22:49:16 Yeah science has gotten tons wrong, but it has the ability to self correct and it's still a good idea that we rely on the latest medical research than, say, superstition or people peddling snake oil.

667 2018-08-06 22:48:30 He’s either as mad as a hatter or acting insane to sell his snake oil pills and potions, like “Brain Force” to his barmy followers. I feel it’s the latter, which is pretty shameful.
668 2018-08-06 22:48:30 So I've got an oil leak. Gonna cost $250 for the part and labor. Or $230 if I buy the part myself for $20 cheaper ( only paying 200$ in labor). i need help, im already having to put oil in twice a week now. i can get the part and have $100 saved up in about 2 weeks.

672 2018-08-06 22:47:59 @realDonaldTrump please listen to professional climate scientists - not those paid by oil companies or Koch brothers. Our climate IS changing - average temps climbing & may reach tipping point of no return.
673 2018-08-06 22:47:58 Oh believe me. We queers love to use oil too, just not the black stuff 
674 2018-08-06 22:47:55 I forgot to buy cbd oil after work and I can’t find melatonin at any of the stores by me. Fuck it, I’ll suffer.
675 2018-08-06 22:47:42 Burning the Midnight Oil here 
676 2018-08-06 22:47:40 I don't believe the sanctions against Iran are due to Iran. Trump wants a war to boost himself and perhaps help some of his oil buddies.
677 2018-08-06 22:47:39 me & traffic is like oil & water.    DONT MIX
678 2018-08-06 22:47:25 Let make lemonade out of these lemons and get our Canadian oil moving East.
679 2018-08-06 22:47:18 They also invest to get access to crude oil at source so that they can get a return on it when they sell. But they have no clue the refinery margin of my six refineries with a particular crude compared to other crudes
680 2018-08-06 22:47:14 i guess the only good thing is that it wasn't an oil tanker...but still, no excuse!
681 2018-08-06 22:47:09 Oh, geeze -- I don't have links at hand but google around two things (and let me try again if you can't find this).  Exhibit A is China making a global offer of gold for oil.  Exhibit B, probably earlier in time iirc, is Russia negotiating direct commodity swaps w/Iran.
682 2018-08-06 22:47:06 The biggest downside to the thing I told you about is the drag that it creates you know it's kind of like taking oil and spending it to mix with water perfectly
683 2018-08-06 22:47:02 Remind again to never get my oil changed at Jiffy Lube.....these guys coudn't change their clothes #twohourslater
684 2018-08-06 22:47:00 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Silly Putty.
685 2018-08-06 22:46:42 Bro... intelligence is the one thing he couldn’t buy with the oil money
686 2018-08-06 22:46:38 2nd oil change in the red truck. After the body lift- the oil filter is even more difficult to get out. I still don't get why the engineers designed it to be so difficult to change the oil filter.
687 2018-08-06 22:46:37 All to help his donors sell more oil?
688 2018-08-06 22:46:23 You're entitled to your own opinion. You can also write your version of history.  What's hurting africa more than dictatorship is the mentality of 'I will remain united if there is no oil, I will secede if there is oil'.
689 2018-08-06 22:46:21 Hey Canada..Minister #Freeland keeps standing up for 1 Saudi disident. No mention of the 800 Canadian oil workers who just lost their jobs.

691 2018-08-06 22:45:57 I'm perfectly ok with snake oil salesmen like Jones being kicked off of platforms. He's a con artist who preys on the socially vulnerable
692 2018-08-06 22:45:47 Check your Engine oil today.
693 2018-08-06 22:45:40 It's all they have... ask them for a debate and they substitute facts with ridicule, insults and quotes from Business for Scotland and Wings over Scotland! What next, hidden whisky exports and secret oil fields?
694 2018-08-06 22:45:39 Money aint everything. Plus maybe now there will be more support for our own damn oil. The day we no longer line the pockets of dictatorship regimes with Canadian money will be a good day.
695 2018-08-06 22:45:34 China will pay you gold for oil, if you've got some.
696 2018-08-06 22:45:29 As a cancer patient myself I would suggest high quality Endoca cbd oil multiple times per day and at night THC drops. It does help particularly with appetite,  nausea and quality sleep.
697 2018-08-06 22:45:25 Drizzle of the oil, then blended with tinned cherry tomatoes and fresh basil
698 2018-08-06 22:45:18 He could allows ask his friends in the oil industry if he could lend a pipeline. Also; Trump needs a majority agreement with the senate to pass anything. He is simply attacking 1 man.
699 2018-08-06 22:45:11 Spray ur house w peppermint oil, water and a lil dish soap
700 2018-08-06 22:45:03 I’m curious as to how many barrels of crude oil does it take to color his hair
701 2018-08-06 22:45:02 Did the bus have an oil leak?  Or is that diesel sludge on his face. Ew.
702 2018-08-06 22:44:59 That would be a `NO`` The Saudis have no respect for Canada`s Leader or any of his representatives!!! They`ll say and do whatever they want because `Trudeau`` depends on THEIR oil & refuses to back our rich oil Western Provinces!!! Shame on him & all his followers!!!
703 2018-08-06 22:44:58 Shout out to my bestie @RedskinVerified for taking my car to get an oil change! Next bottles are on me lol
704 2018-08-06 22:44:55 Saudis playing trump on #Canada  is so lame. Who cares if you stop trading with Canadians. After all the only thing Al Saud exports is oil and the only thing they spent their money on is to create coward suicide bombers who are brained washed by saudi made ideology "Wahabism".
705 2018-08-06 22:44:49 Fires in CA are bing magnified by climate change. Trees soak up he carbon put in the air by oil & coal pollutors. More drought less rain... and most water is diverted to the perifical canal & sent to farmers growing crops in the desert.
706 2018-08-06 22:44:48 He’s had a weird hard-on for narrow, protruding mouths since the damn 1990s. Dude’s designs have not aged well imo.

708 2018-08-06 22:44:24 424 itu yang mana fi? 10 steps termasuk 1st cleanser, 2nd cleanser, toner, pelembab, sunblock, serum, face oil, face mist, sheet mask, exfoliator, mask, etc. Banyak yah 
709 2018-08-06 22:44:22 @media_ksa you fucking Arab pussys dont want to fuck with Canada. You can't even win a war with Yemen with the help of other nations. You have oil, big fucking deal. Pull your terrorists out of our schools we gladly send them back to your pussy nation.
710 2018-08-06 22:44:09 Saudi Arabia, useless country which grew up on the power of oil n foreign workers. 
Arrogant locals who treated the foreign workers as personal slaves.
No rights for women.
711 2018-08-06 22:44:04 Pouring a gallon of tea tree oil on my pimple so let’s hope it disappears
712 2018-08-06 22:44:00 Continuing to burn coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is like rolling up car windows on a hot summer day.

713 2018-08-06 22:44:00 Gays have always been a bigger threat than global warming. We don’t need drapes and parades. We need oil.
714 2018-08-06 22:43:57 Plus $2,000 subsidies per person to Coal and Oil corporations is the real price we pay for our energy.
715 2018-08-06 22:43:56 Because they hate us, and our Government wants to be friends? It's #oil, nothing else. #qanon
716 2018-08-06 22:43:54 Everything y have is made from oil your plastic floors,house,. computer, car.
717 2018-08-06 22:43:53 The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin AbdulAziz & his Crown Prince, Mohammad Bin Salman have directed for giving $60 million worth of oil derivatives"monthly" to cover deficit in the power plants in the Yemeni Governorates, to alleviate Yemeni people’s suffering.
718 2018-08-06 22:43:48 Hes not stuck, he has a way out, hes just snake oil salesman who has bamboozled an entire civilization
719 2018-08-06 22:43:45 Sounds like/looks like an admission to me? Not very subtle. A shame we aren’t still the economic oli super power we should be. We could ramp up production, flood the market, and really get their attention. But - no oil, no military, no leadership - toothless. Pitiful. #cdnpoli
720 2018-08-06 22:43:22 Oil wars. Iran has the most pipelines
721 2018-08-06 22:43:08 I'll have to look up toxicity levels for pets and also ratios, but I do have lavender oil. Thanks Shaun! (Suggestions from you are always welcome as long as you don't think you can fix my chronic medical issues with yoga.)
722 2018-08-06 22:43:03 Wti Crude Oil
723 2018-08-06 22:43:02 And I dumped the gear oil too!   That’s even worse.
724 2018-08-06 22:42:41 We don't need Saudi oil. We have a bunch of our own. So Canada is one of a few countries that doesn't have to bow to the Saudi Crown Family.
725 2018-08-06 22:42:21 Oil traders have no idea if a refiner wants a crude or not even if it has historically bought it because it does not know the margins the refiner is getting. It asks refiners in case their is interest.
726 2018-08-06 22:42:16 SOS can anyone get me the hookup for one of those oil cartridges for dab pens tonight pls n thanks
727 2018-08-06 22:42:08 @ronaldreagan40 , Suzanne Massie, Afghanistan, The Christian Orthodox Church, Solidarnosc , falls in oil and gas revenues and perhaps to Xi’s question:

Perestroika and Glasnost
728 2018-08-06 22:41:56 Bro Cher old and ain’t the sexiest of his breed but I love maintenance days like I be getting his oil changed, tires balanced and rotated, engine checked, washed & I’m like you go honey you a whole new bihhhh today go head and stunt on the streets like you a 2018 wrangler
729 2018-08-06 22:41:52 These are conventional oil wells and they aren't fracking. Do some research.
730 2018-08-06 22:41:31 Yes, and replace it with Alberta oil, via a pipeline. Didn't we have thos debate already? As I recall, you and I were on the same side.
731 2018-08-06 22:41:27 Not sure where you’re getting your data from but US shale production is rewiring oil markets & creating geopolitical earthquakes

North America is energy independent and has sufficient reserves for something like 100 years. This is why US is now disinterested in leading the world
732 2018-08-06 22:41:26 Great start with Saudis. Now imagine if we could replace the oil we import from there from a country with great human rights and environmental standards
733 2018-08-06 22:41:09 Canada is a big customer for Saudi oil!
734 2018-08-06 22:41:04 I admit I know very little of pinterest, and I don't have much curiosity either, but isn't it a site marketed towards housewives selling jewelry and trinkets? how does that gel with a "character artist" selling snake oil and conspiracy theories to bigots and the unintelligent
735 2018-08-06 22:41:00 my lifesaviours:
1. my father
2. vaseline
3. baby oil / sweet almond oil / jojoba oil
736 2018-08-06 22:40:47 Seriously? £520 for oil change and those filters?
737 2018-08-06 22:40:45 オリィさんのツイートは、ロリと同じくらい好き。
738 2018-08-06 22:40:45 Why can people find the time to complain about gas prices, but the the time to understand how gas prices move and why. I’ll give you a hint, crude oil. Lol
739 2018-08-06 22:40:39 Saudi Arabia is used to western indifference because of their oil. Canada has a history of spreading the message of human rights. Why are they so surprised?
740 2018-08-06 22:40:35 Just to be clear... I never liked Alex Jones; I loath him. His "health & wellness" products are nothing but snake oil—as are much of his politics. While I certainly find him obnoxious, those in the Praetorian Guard media who censor him are without a doubt, TRULY abhorrent.
741 2018-08-06 22:40:28 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
742 2018-08-06 22:40:08 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
743 2018-08-06 22:39:59 Who doesn’t mate, hope they didn’t put oil on it after the meeting because that would be so silly can’t think anyone would be that stupid
744 2018-08-06 22:39:53 Nothing like a native heirloom tomato with fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced red onion, fresh basil, a pinch of dried oregano, extra virgin olive oil and a balsamic drizzle.

It’s a meal in itself!
745 2018-08-06 22:39:50 The salad I make at home at least once a week is:
Kale (massaged with olive oil), quinoa, radish, carrot, beet, avocado, apple, goat cheese, and some kind of citrus dressing. 

Deal breakers for me are onion, tomato, olives, and iceberg/romaine lettuce
746 2018-08-06 22:39:38 You use baby oil ?!? Girl if you may I want this tea pls
747 2018-08-06 22:39:31 Propaganda. Saudis would have arrested her by now and you would not see this picture. The lot of Irani women is much better than in Wahabi Saudi regime. Irani women work, drive, take decisions. Why not tweet on Saudi women? Answer: Saudis are piliable on oil and golan heights.
748 2018-08-06 22:39:23 Now everybody is a genious. Then, all of them and their mothers were calling lower for longer and forever. This analysts should be out of their jobs. Shame on them #oil #crudeoil #energy
749 2018-08-06 22:39:21 She moisture Manuka honey and Mafura oil line is bomb asf just too expensive
750 2018-08-06 22:39:19 Careful they were calling lower for longer when #oil at low 30’s.  Scary! Will Goldman be right this time ?
751 2018-08-06 22:39:18 Big Tech's encroachment into pretty much all industries makes it a far bigger problem/threat to our country than Wall Street/Bankers, Big Pharma & Big Oil could ever dream of being
752 2018-08-06 22:39:16 I'd like to see it spawn a Lava-nado
753 2018-08-06 22:39:08 My guy buy it for me and send it here 
754 2018-08-06 22:39:07 You will continue to see that number drop as America takes over as the greatest producer of oil.

We have paid for every presidents transportation and security nothing is new that's always happened.
755 2018-08-06 22:38:52 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
756 2018-08-06 22:38:48 Sadly, we NEED their oil - because the Liberal Government  refused to become energy self-sufficient! Without 
Energy East, we need to bring oil in by ship on the east coast.
757 2018-08-06 22:38:47 Membership of EU has transformed the range of foods available in UK.  Pre EU Camembert & Brie were about the only French cheeses in UK shops. Now there are loads of them. Olive oil was once sold only in small bottles in pharmacies to be used for earache.
758 2018-08-06 22:38:45 No Shit, Mr Ambassador - money and oil ... especially when it affects Trump Corporate bottom line!
759 2018-08-06 22:38:19 INJURY CASH: McCracken Co. - Eastbound I-24 @ 16 mile mark motorcycle crash. First responders have it off to the side of roadway but be alert on approach to crash scene. be alert to large oil spill on roadway.
760 2018-08-06 22:38:17 Free window clean and vacuum w my oil change.. I guess I’m satisfied
761 2018-08-06 22:38:06 @tartecosmetics after sampling I purchased 50ml maracuja oil, however the wooden part of the lid is loose, the gold top has detached and I’ve only had it two weeks ! Fantastic product and beautiful bottle but it’s an accident waiting to happen with a tiled floor and loose lid.
762 2018-08-06 22:37:58 Someone teach me how to change my own oil!!!!
763 2018-08-06 22:37:56 Alex Jones has made enough money to last several lifetimes. If you feel bad that his agitation of the general populace has stopped and he can no longer sell his "snake oil" cures then you really aren't seeing the problem with him.
764 2018-08-06 22:37:55 @neiltyson I have a question with all these wild fires, flooding etc. Why not build a water pipeline rather than these stupid oil pipelines, when a city/town/state is going to flood, has overflow of water, open the pipeline and send the water to states fighting wildfires?
765 2018-08-06 22:37:51 Then Jamaican black castor oil
766 2018-08-06 22:37:47 I hate coming to get my oil change alone...people are so awkward
767 2018-08-06 22:37:23 Stay strong with Canadian principles on human rights and garner respect.
Don't be bullied by tin-pot oil barons that run the backwards and repressive regime that is Saudi Arabia...
768 2018-08-06 22:37:21 The same has been happening against Iran for last 50 years , and you lot been supporting it and financing countries like Canada for , suddenly its something you dont like ? What a joke ! Get a life and start thinking about your life after oil
769 2018-08-06 22:37:20 Lies! Saudis were created by Britain so they could exploit oil and Saudis kept the population quiet. The Saud family depends on Wahhabi cult that is source of Al Qaeda and ISIS and US military and weapons. Tyranny is not an internal affair. Barbarism!
770 2018-08-06 22:37:18 Trudeau cripples the development of the oil and gas within Canada and now cripples the importing of oil for Canadians. Remove him from office.
771 2018-08-06 22:37:07 Went by myself for the first time to get an oil change and they lost my keys
772 2018-08-06 22:36:57 Sherry, Please burn the midnight oil! Good night Patriot Family! Jesus will watch over us while we sleep!
773 2018-08-06 22:36:54 I actually wanted to bring up how underpaid nurses are, but I didn't want to take light away from teachers.  However, there are so many vital professions that are grossly underappreciated & underpaid. It's disturbing. But if you work in the oil field you make BANK. 
774 2018-08-06 22:36:53 CBD Oil Topicals can, absolutely. A tincture of CBD Oil is better intended to be taken subglingually. Want to try some? Let us know and we’ll send you.
775 2018-08-06 22:36:47 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but the question is how bad do you want it ?
776 2018-08-06 22:36:45 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match

779 2018-08-06 22:36:35 I wonder what happens if you beard oil on eyebrows 
780 2018-08-06 22:36:29 Ever catch a Rat in a sticky trap then feel sorry for them and pour oil on them to let them go? And wake up one morning weeks later and find things chewed, food eaten and sh*t and p*ss in every corner? Antifa needs to be destroyed. Starting with the biggest Rat George Soros!
781 2018-08-06 22:36:28 If you are in the mood to slip and fall , just pour a little argan oil on the floor 
782 2018-08-06 22:36:27 excuse me while I check the oil again in my ‘99 honda accord that’s leaking oil because I can’t afford to get it fixed so I just keep putting oil in it when it’s low lol

784 2018-08-06 22:36:11 Completely love your podcasts. I was first introduced through EIS weekly email when you were reviewing The Innocents. You’ve mentioned Midnight Oil previously, are you acquainted with their excellent album (Diesel And Dust) enough to include that.
Keep up the good work!!
785 2018-08-06 22:36:08 I caint get that $25 oil change. The jo’nt won’t let me be great.
786 2018-08-06 22:35:58 Things on my mind:
- market determined FX rates 
- deregulated downstream oil sector
- identity management system 
- self funded universities
- export oriented focus

789 2018-08-06 22:35:44 Buy some peppermint oil Put it on her temples
790 2018-08-06 22:35:38 And they give you SUCH a big port to add the oil back in...
791 2018-08-06 22:35:24 Nice work, I killed about 30 pizzas before I got it down. Grill as hot as possible, dough stretched thin, brush one side completely with olive oil, oil side down then quickly brush the top completely with oil. About 90 seconds, flip, quickly sauce it and top then cheese. FWIW
792 2018-08-06 22:35:22 And FYI, don't want to pay VED @lisaj2190 then don't drive a stinking polluting oil burning machine. Plenty other ways to use the road & not pay VEHICLE EMISSION DUTY. Even ride a horse will do, even better try walking. It'll be safer for everyone else from you. @PaulCoops1984
793 2018-08-06 22:35:22 I'm currently serving on grand jury. One poor bastard charged with "destroying evidence" for throwing tiny vial of cannabis oil out car window while Clinton filth walks free. SICKENING. The time is NOW to stand up & END the lawlessness of a government corrupt to the core. #1776
794 2018-08-06 22:35:19 thanks @youtube for limiting my access to REAL NEWS & FISH OIL #FML
795 2018-08-06 22:34:58 Meditation and CBD Oil should do the trick. I'm off my anxiety meds... Good luck!
796 2018-08-06 22:34:58 Where is the UK, Australia and New Zealand on this issue, especially on relocation of foreign students? As for US, I think we know they won’t say anything as they would be quite happy about the discord between the countries.  Doesn’t Oil rule for the US and Saudi Arabia?
797 2018-08-06 22:34:53 How about using the Venezuelan Bolivar? It's at least twice as strong as the Rial. And only 1,000,000% inflation. It's also backed by oil that, like Iran, they can't seem to sell.
798 2018-08-06 22:34:49 I have been taking @USANAinc vitamins for over thirteen years and notice a difference in how I feel each day,  I take a potent anti oxidant/mineral, fish oil , and grape seed extract
799 2018-08-06 22:34:32 Those conflicting articles were terribly confusing. The newspapers rarely reported that the ice-age scientists were supported by Big Oil and other fossil fuel entities. We learned that only later. Today, it’s easy to look such details up, but in those days, we had to rely on 2/

805 2018-08-06 22:33:56 Brad, if the oil comes from Alberta and not by tanker from Saudi, how will all the Liberal Elite make money from their Tanker investments as they have the last 40+ years??
Martin, Chrétien, Trudeau, many others are heavily invested in oil tankers....
806 2018-08-06 22:33:53 And the just put Ray Lewis in the HoF, go figure.
807 2018-08-06 22:33:53 One is either perfectly fine with the market outcome or one would like it changed. Change happens by government interference.

I see no reason for any government action to change where Canadian oil is being sold and how much oil is being imported to Canada.

812 2018-08-06 22:33:19 @Target you might as well close down your store located on Lone Tree Way in Antioch CA because they never have ANYTHING who’s in charge of shipping them stuff tell them to order some PEPPERMINT OIL FUCK
813 2018-08-06 22:33:17 Saudi oil money goes a long, long way in Washington.
814 2018-08-06 22:33:11 truck that’s low on oil asmr
815 2018-08-06 22:33:01 Hm a chartered accountant is not an ecconomist. Just as a cook is not a Michelin Chef. Clearly !  and after all that 4 years study I’m horrified has failed to read snps own report that says she’s wrong !  Oh dear perhaps should be certified instead . Venezuela has more oil
816 2018-08-06 22:32:59 I don’t recommend using any heavy moisturizers in the summer like vitamin e oil or Shea butter. Use a dime size of coconut oil for your face
817 2018-08-06 22:32:50 Big Pharma and vaccines kill.... We need access to alternative medicines including CBD Oil, medical marijuana etc

821 2018-08-06 22:31:58 Sorry palm oil, you wont understand..
822 2018-08-06 22:31:32 Hey Saudi Arabia. On behalf of Canadians, suck it. We don't need you to survive. We have more oil than you and we're good for sand.
823 2018-08-06 22:31:21 Remember it further along Argylle St always smelt of patchouli or trog oil but loved the one under Stairways bought so many mostly 2nd hand records there!
824 2018-08-06 22:31:16 That's what happens when you throw water on burning oil
825 2018-08-06 22:31:10 Umm, shouldn’t we have become energy self-sufficient (like the U.S.) BEFORE we ticked off one of our top oil suppliers? Energy East, for example?
826 2018-08-06 22:31:07 Does bacon cause cancer today as l just ate some & it was gr8t?  Maybe l need some KALE cooked in olive oil so l can slide it in the trash easily!
827 2018-08-06 22:30:55 As a Canadian : Cool.  I'm happy to see us not interacting with this ass-backwards shithole that only exists because of oil.
828 2018-08-06 22:30:51 Primitive monarchical theocracies are repugnant to all. Saudi Arabia has one reason for any attention: oil! Once we end our dependence on that poison the will be shunned.
829 2018-08-06 22:30:46 I haven’t made a name for myself calling school shootings fake, calling victims crisis actors, and selling worthless snake oil supplements.....

Not that worried

831 2018-08-06 22:30:43 they all got that same smell like they just left the hospital or took a bath in hand sanitizer and olive oil
832 2018-08-06 22:30:36 Steak - Add a nice, simple rub(salt, fresh ground pepper, some garlic powder), add some fresh rosemary(cook it in some olive oil first and flash cook it on high [oil on high, throw it in for 5-10 seconds to release flavors on both sides]) and then throw it in the bag & set to 180

Makes me wonder on diesel stuff like dies was originally designed to run on peanut oil.
Enjoy the content man, keep doing what you enjoy.

836 2018-08-06 22:30:15 I understand that oil generates a lot of revenue but these car companies should’ve invested in electric vehicles 10years ago when climate change started taking effect. @Ford @Dodge @MercedesBenz @nissan @GM @Toyota @BMW @Honda
837 2018-08-06 22:30:14 Aren't you tired of using groundnut oil.
838 2018-08-06 22:30:01 Doubt it.  She can do no wrong.
839 2018-08-06 22:29:59 EV owners tend to charge at home and have green / renewable energy suppliers. By the time that everyone has an EV, oil refineries and related fossil fuel industries including electricity generators will have shut down and they are THE biggest users of electricity at the moment.
840 2018-08-06 22:29:53 Is oil money worth commiting treason to your country? I believe this is all about oil and Natural gas.
841 2018-08-06 22:29:47 The Canadian govt does not have a principled approach to foreign policy. If we did, none of this would be happening, our position would have been clears years ago. We should also be boycotting Saudi Oil, but we won’t, it’s all just words!
842 2018-08-06 22:29:47 Well, you got to put all that cheaply drilled oil to good use. Distance and flying time be damned.
843 2018-08-06 22:29:44 So what does that mean ??? Not being a sa but you in the oil industry or something like that ....
844 2018-08-06 22:29:40 not offended :)
I choose freedom over "free stuff" because some day, your oil will run out or simply not be needed, but I will still have freedom. Freedom can't be bought.
845 2018-08-06 22:29:37 Ha ha seems so. Great..it's bit overcast in S.E.Q this morning few drops of rain, praying for more. Like most #Queenslanders locked onto @jennyweather every night for the good oil. Being a former Toowoomba girl she could give you the Royal tour out there!
846 2018-08-06 22:29:34 My coworker just told me she “needs to be on that CDL oil” LOL
847 2018-08-06 22:29:31 Yeah, I'd rather just shotgun the oil.
848 2018-08-06 22:29:20 Had To Get A Oil Change At 3 And I Work At 1. Fucked Around And Let Dick Get My Car To Get It Fixed .
849 2018-08-06 22:29:15 We were without oil and in decent life  and after oil still we are in decent life, because we are following islam roles, 
Good luck when lose ethics will run away to hell..
850 2018-08-06 22:28:54 only because of their oil.........need for oil will soon be coming to an end, then Saudi Arabia will be a poor and deserted wasteland.
851 2018-08-06 22:28:51 For a decent Ragu sweat down the onion, garlic, carrot, celery in olive oil on a really low heat so it melts into the oil, brown the mince in another pan in small batches on a high heat so it doesn't cool down the pan and boil then add the meat and tomatoes (tinned or passata)
852 2018-08-06 22:28:47 Palm oil comes from the palm of your hands when they sweat?
853 2018-08-06 22:28:37 We take very little Saudi oil, just about 10% of imports and we are a net exporter. It would be very easy for the refineries in NB and NL to find another source if it came to it.
854 2018-08-06 22:28:37 Those islands beside the North Sea Oil.
855 2018-08-06 22:28:35 I would hv hooked u up in Lagos here,but I'm busy at work
856 2018-08-06 22:28:26 "Yeah!"

She called over somebody and they grabbed one of the packaged tents from the back. 

"So... then we need some oil and some sleeping bags! Oh and a cooler for our drinks!"

858 2018-08-06 22:28:13 Saudi Arabia talks about Canada #StickingOnesNoseWhereItDoesntBelong

How about the US takes their good advice and get our noses out of the Shia/Sunni culture war thats been going on in the Middle East for over a millennia and gets the he'll out of Yemen and Syria? 

Oh wait, oil
859 2018-08-06 22:28:12 CBD Oil is the truth! #CBD #CBDOIL #ANXIETY #STRESS I cannot recommend it enough
860 2018-08-06 22:28:11 I can bear witness brother. People still believe you’re one faculty president ABU never had before. 

We were having a discussion with a friend from another faculty, just of a recent, and he told me himself that he thinks you were more popular than the then SRC president.
861 2018-08-06 22:28:01 Go sell your snake oil elsewhere.
862 2018-08-06 22:28:00 Guess you didn’t use diplomatic language! Who’s going to take up the slack this winter when it comes to heating oil? The U.S.? Wait a minute! Didn’t we tick THEM off, too.
863 2018-08-06 22:27:57 The Snipeocracy has standards to maintain and many peasants to expend keeping the oil boiling.
864 2018-08-06 22:27:45 I had every intention on stopping by a store on my way home to get some washing powder... Got home and only had a slushy and a bottle of oil in my hands

866 2018-08-06 22:27:37 All of Canada's oil needs should be serviceable at least cost via Canadian pipelines. Energy East would go a long way to making this possible. Investment decisions need a quick and clear process or they will not happen.

868 2018-08-06 22:27:27 Excuse me miss, I’m looking for this new Essential Oil all the wives are talking about. I heard it’s a killer scent. It’s called arsenic. Do you have it in stock?
869 2018-08-06 22:27:27 mamma mia songs keep playing while i’m in public places and i think it’s a sign that i’m gonna strike oil and become rich.
870 2018-08-06 22:27:23 I'm all about pickles and jam too btw - the tomatoes: split and lightly salt, on oiled baking sheet in v low oven (175-200) for 5 hours or so, till moisture is gone but before they go black. Then cover in olive oil. It's a recipe for plum tomatoes but seemed to work w cherries!
871 2018-08-06 22:27:03 Dude at the garage is micro managing his oil change so hard. Bro just let her do her job.......
872 2018-08-06 22:26:59 If I’m a snowflake then you’re a... (googles opposite of ice & according to asoiaf its oil)... A barrel of oil. 

That’s right you horribly outdated, planet ruining, war starting, evil goo of greed that thinks it’s the best ever when it’s been scientifically proven otherwise.
873 2018-08-06 22:26:37 answering my uncles phone call
me: “he-“
him: “how’s that car doing? are your tires low? HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR OIL?”
874 2018-08-06 22:26:29 I think I made the best steak of my life on Saturday... The marinade was soy sauce, liquid smoke, garlic and sesame oil. Holy shit
875 2018-08-06 22:26:19 Also wonder now if they ban Saudi oil from coming here if Esstern Canada will reconsider a pipeline or maybe they’ll all go back to pedal bikes
876 2018-08-06 22:26:19 Just hospitals! Education is free up to University/College. We don't sit on a vast quantity of oil. We're also 6000 Km in length so it takes a bit of money to maintain roads, but we have freedom to think, worship, speak, marry, laugh, and learn. Money doesn't buy happiness.
877 2018-08-06 22:26:15 Fact/Spell check?  Or is it Charlotte Police Department (CPD) oil?
878 2018-08-06 22:26:04 We’re in the middle of a heat wave. Regular oil would suffice
879 2018-08-06 22:26:04 99% of my clothes are stained with oil paint, its a curse
880 2018-08-06 22:25:34 Also a PSA for back to school. Athens Target is sold out of oil blotting wipes. An apparent srat tragedy
881 2018-08-06 22:25:27 Dogshit article. Very little science actually cited. Yes their is questionable efficacy of fish oil but you barely cover it. Even less attention is paid to how fish oil harms the ecosystem. Do better.
882 2018-08-06 22:25:20 Well now I’m imaging you in a throne room receiving supplicants and when you *are* displeased they get thrown into boiling oil.
883 2018-08-06 22:25:05 US doesn't look at Iranians as humans. They are just OIL droplets. 
884 2018-08-06 22:25:00 The West’s hunger for oil made the Saudis ditch any pretense to humanist civilization back in 1970.
885 2018-08-06 22:25:00 Great are we going to quit buying their oil and import western Canadian oil into eastern Canada this is a great thing
886 2018-08-06 22:24:50 sounds a bit like cystic acne - my best weapon against it is pure tea tree oil (dilute if needed, but I use it full strength). I apply it 2x a day at least to building cystic acne and it helps shrink it
887 2018-08-06 22:24:50 you think oil spills are more problematic than life without oil would be for most of the world? Talk about living a privileged life.
888 2018-08-06 22:24:47 To be fair, the Obama administration didn’t take Canada’s side when Saudi Arabia tried to force us out of the oil market after the bust in 2014. The Saudis weren’t exactly subtle about it either. That was their stated goal.
889 2018-08-06 22:24:41 Will other NATO nations pull their embassies in protest against Saudi Arabia?
What a perfect time to say, "Let's switch to wind and solar and hydro power. Fuck Saudi oil!"
890 2018-08-06 22:24:19 neem oil smells like arthemeter
891 2018-08-06 22:23:55 Past is not past..it is now and future for us...we have been experiencing the same shit in middle east since oil became the center of attention..just look at the situation now...
#stopmeddlinginIran
892 2018-08-06 22:23:46 Canada does not need their oil. The rest of the world should boycott as well.
893 2018-08-06 22:23:36 those are great but perhaps some water maps where everyone gets there own chunk of land and a sea with oil that separates everyone and some unclaimed smaller islands
894 2018-08-06 22:23:33 aside from baby powder, what are my fellow thick girls using to combat thigh chafing. i use light oils like jojoba oil but jojoba too expensive to be lathering on like that.
895 2018-08-06 22:23:32 No one wants to put pressure on Arabia because of oil and money. Which is more important to governments than human rights!!!
896 2018-08-06 22:23:01 I cant decide if hed buy Hank beard oil to stop that or literally fluff his beard beforehand to make it worse
897 2018-08-06 22:23:00 The oil chunkies act like ruffage
898 2018-08-06 22:22:47 The day I saw someone frying egg with palm oil I was so shocked . Had to ask how life is doing the person , like Bros person offend you
899 2018-08-06 22:22:14 Yeah I first tried it in a pen form that I got from a dispensary and the first time I did it made me fall asleep. But that did have some thc in it. I just got pure CBD oil that you put under your tongue. I like that better cause I can control the dose
900 2018-08-06 22:22:07 i think us being denied access to saudi arabia is his way to win the carbon tax  battle no oil or gas then no carbon
901 2018-08-06 22:22:01 I made baked potato wedges with olive oil and Parmesan, and salmon on the grill with dill butter sauce and I feel like a CHEF. It was delicious, too. 
902 2018-08-06 22:21:50 Why all my hygiene products gotta run out at the same time smfh I gotta buy new razors, after shave, shampoo, body wash, and beard oil all at the same time 
903 2018-08-06 22:21:44 Shame on YOU.  We don't jail activists and we don't behead people.  Good luck when your oil reserves run out.
904 2018-08-06 22:21:38 Brent changed my oil at JiffyLube last week
905 2018-08-06 22:21:16 didnt you say you have zanax if you need? maybe take one or two of them and just head to sleep, if you can! Or if you dont want meds, do you have bergamont essential oil? Its v good for panic. Lavender is v good to calm you. may chang or lemon is good to bring your focus back.

913 2018-08-06 22:19:48 Yes, CBD oil is good, if you can get it. Lemon Balm capsules or tea work very well, as does Kava Kava. Good stuff!
914 2018-08-06 22:19:40 I get an oil change every month
915 2018-08-06 22:19:33 Yes I do think theres a diff - the Orvel Reddenbacker is good. I used to use the hot air popper too but got hooked on this w coconut oil. I used have my popcorn w a lot of butter before

917 2018-08-06 22:19:31 SA is a horrible nation. If it was not for oil, they would be isolated from civil societies.

919 2018-08-06 22:19:19 CBD oil? Lol!!
920 2018-08-06 22:19:18 Trader Joe’s coconut oil is sooo yummy, has you smelling like a flan de coco and shit 
921 2018-08-06 22:19:18 Thank you
922 2018-08-06 22:19:18 I am curious, could this be in any way connected to the liberal ‘environmental’ strategy?!
Have the SA oil cut off, cost of gasoline and heat shoots up, we drive less & freeze!
A backdoor carbon tax?
It’s a great diversion, and the liberals can blame SA!
I smell G Butts!
923 2018-08-06 22:19:08 Cranial oil
924 2018-08-06 22:19:06 No more conflict oil.
925 2018-08-06 22:19:02 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
926 2018-08-06 22:18:45 Right. Ok Donald here is what you have to do: 1-make peace with Iran 2- make them invade Saudi Arabia 3-get deals on oil and weapon 4- you just stop terrorism by getting rid of Saudis! And you got a deal with Iran!!!  :) please do it, pretty please topple Saudis.

929 2018-08-06 22:18:23 The guy was smoother than a oil slick on an iceberg, and about as toxic.
930 2018-08-06 22:18:23 There was no official world-wide consensus--that didn't 'officially' happen until the Bush admin, but it was known that human activity was causing the Greenhouse Effect to science, and Sagan was all over it, saying that cutting oil, for ex, is also good for political reasons...
931 2018-08-06 22:18:14 So when will @instagram crack down on scam advertisements? I’m really tired of seeing ads for snake oil
932 2018-08-06 22:18:08 Yeah it’s really good, when I was born I had open heart surgery and my mum used bio oil on me. My scars barely visible unless you’re really looking for it
933 2018-08-06 22:17:24 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH omg  plus madaming chicken oil hahaha as in gutom na ko
934 2018-08-06 22:16:54 i had to take my car to get an oil change today, and the waiting room was filled with older people on their phones, meanwhile i was playing sudoku with a pad and pencil 
935 2018-08-06 22:16:46 CIA.  Attempted oil grab. Trump.
936 2018-08-06 22:16:16 History will be as kind to you as it was to Tony Blair about Iraq if you keep on selling snake oil on WTO rules.

939 2018-08-06 22:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
940 2018-08-06 22:16:07  Scotland has more oil than Texas and based on your knowledge of maritime borders most of the oil in the gulf would belong to Mexico and Cuba
941 2018-08-06 22:16:07 If the oil deposits are discovered as expected near the Pak-Iran Border, Pak will be among top 10 oil-producing countries ahead of Kuwait in 6th posn. That’s huge! We need to reduce our fuel import bill to take care of the current Bal of payment /  current accts deficit crisis.

945 2018-08-06 22:15:35 Agreed. Stop buying their oil.
946 2018-08-06 22:15:34 Change your oil + spark plugs, check the coolant

Most of this shit is general maintenance that's super cheap and easy to fix, plus old as cars are pretty straightforward under the hood even if you don't know what you're doing

Only go to a mechanic if you need the engine out

949 2018-08-06 22:15:22 Can’t refute this argument as I do not personally know oil traders. One would hope that they would have a least some basic knowledge given their exorbitant pay and large borrowing limits from banks, but accept that hope is no guarantee.

955 2018-08-06 22:14:07 This has always contained this ingredient. A misconception is that all ingredients with the word alcohol are liquids and dry hair. In fact, the fatty alcohols SheaMoisture uses are solids, derived from coconut oil and plant sugars, are excellent conditioners for hair.
956 2018-08-06 22:13:59 MBS has finally proved that he is jaahil, immature, irrational and unfit to rule a key islamic state. These hypocrites are killing their own brothers in Yemen and do nothing when asked to suspend oil supply to Israel.

Got an oil change and full tank tho
961 2018-08-06 22:12:42 You gutted the EPA you deny climate change, you spit the th face of scientific fact, You lower EPA regulations and put more pollution into the air, You sell off out national parks to oil fracking.

968 2018-08-06 22:12:07 Good for Freeland. Someone has to inform the Saudi Government that this is the 21st century. Stop buying their oil. Then they’ll  shut up
969 2018-08-06 22:11:57 Well he's tried in Administration, only wrong in politics and politicking
970 2018-08-06 22:11:51 We have more oil than you, and within 50 years your use of oil is going to make your county inhospitable. Good luck with that.
971 2018-08-06 22:11:43 Someone teach me how to have that dewy skin makeup look without also looking like someone put oil on my face afterwards. Is this even possible??
972 2018-08-06 22:11:35 if someone could come and rub coconut oil in my hair that would be great thanks
973 2018-08-06 22:11:14 Do you think the EU will do that? Not for all the oil in Saudi Arabia! Dream on.
974 2018-08-06 22:11:06 Surely there's a way to ferment coconut oil
975 2018-08-06 22:11:04 Well said sir. Just another reason to get the pipelines built and tell Saudi Arabia to shove its oil where the sun don’t shine. Vile disgusting barbaric regime. They should face condemnation from the world. They are just as disgusting as the Iranian regime.
976 2018-08-06 22:10:53 call sunflowers mainstream and "baduy" but you cannot say no to sunflower oil as moisturizer
977 2018-08-06 22:10:48 Yes if a bad actor are controlling supply i.e railroad prices oil supply. Market failures like that can be deadly.

983 2018-08-06 22:10:18 Got the oil changed in the truck today. The mechanic tells me they’re just waiting to put my skid plate back on and I just start laughing. I’m taking a copy of @Sean_G_Murphy Off Road to him tomorrow.
984 2018-08-06 22:10:06 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
985 2018-08-06 22:09:47 Thank you for the reply.

All oils regardless of source contain no DNA.  

Besides the butterfly label and increased price there would be no way to ascertain non-gmo oil from gmo plant oil.  

This is the issue.

The label - your label spins fear where none is needed.

Thx again
986 2018-08-06 22:09:43 the reason earth will slow down and get warmer because there's not enough oil to balance earth anymore.and earth will face the sun for longer time and that's why the earth will get warmer.and that's what you have also you are going to have all kind of earthquakes and volcanoes.
987 2018-08-06 22:09:34 much talk on here about the consequences of taking in too much sun.

When oil prices are up Venezuela is vindication of Socialism and Chavez is my husbando, when the whole thing collapses Venezuela is a proof Capitalism doesn't work who's Maduro?
996 2018-08-06 22:08:05 Ahhh but these are oil people. He has never suggested any restrictions for Saudi as he has for other middle eastern travelers.
997 2018-08-06 22:07:58 This is like the oil companies colluding to set prices, which is bad enough, but also working directly with a major news organization as their propaganda arm. This cannot stand, ffs.

1003 2018-08-06 22:06:48 Kuwait is among the top ten countries in terms of largest oil reserves per country after Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Iraq, and Russia.

1010 2018-08-06 22:05:44 To dismiss the relevance of the work of the Ascended Christ, as Master Builder of "ekklesia" is tantamount to the foolish virgins who went to meet the Bridegroom with lamps and no oil: it  reflects a state of unreadiness in the Kingdom mentality.

1036 2018-08-06 22:02:47 It might also just be the change in products, I also switched to oil recently and broke out, but it has calmed down again now.

1041 2018-08-06 22:02:27 Why are y’all giving your pets essentials oil in the first place
1042 2018-08-06 22:02:20 Holistic purposes tho. Like Cannibas oil for kid's seizures. It emphasizes the healing benefits of the scheduled narcotic. That's all. I prefer to have the vivid hallucinations tho.
1043 2018-08-06 22:02:18 Looks great. Do you add olive oil and will these be processed?

1046 2018-08-06 22:02:07 Tourism is roughly 12% of GDP while oil is around 40%. Check your facts jack. Illegal booze is probably a bigger commodity than religion!
1047 2018-08-06 22:02:01 There has to be some serious oil politics going on - Canada pivoting away from USA and towards China??

1064 2018-08-06 21:59:48 Again, I don't waste my time watching if the contracts are in backwardation or contango as I think it's irrelevant. The oil price didn't fall on nothing, it fell on Rouhani's comments, which again are noise and don't change fundamentals.
1065 2018-08-06 21:59:12 He’s a snake oil sales man dealing in hate and fear. Con man.
1066 2018-08-06 21:59:12 Right. Like when we split up oil. or price collusion among railroads. Its hard to build railroads, and it extremely difficult to maintain say you tube. Theres cases where companies organize 'industry standards' and that is okay. I think the internet can liberalize w/o govt
1067 2018-08-06 21:59:10 About time.  He can go hawk his snake oil and hatred on some other platform, preferably one nobody's heard of.

1085 2018-08-06 21:57:13 Ok, how about a spreader of blatant lies and false conspiracy theories? How about guy who brings horrid trolls to harass parents of dead kids? How about snake oil salesman of numerous crap cure all products?

That work for you?

1088 2018-08-06 21:56:50 What will be left for the historias to study is the mediocrity of millions of sheep judging the elected President of a country (largest oil reserve on Earth) they know literally nothing about, apart from 24/7 war propaganda from US massively corrupted corporate media
1089 2018-08-06 21:56:38 In other words, Saudi Arabia doesn't like being called out on it's obvious suppression of human rights, and because they think they're all big and bad because they supply oil, they're kicking up a fuss and calling Canada a big meanie.
Here's my official reply. #FuckYOU

1091 2018-08-06 21:56:36 “That’ll really hurt us.” said nobody in Canada, ever. Hoping the next step will be an embargo on crude oil imports to Canada. #cdnpoli
1092 2018-08-06 21:56:36 @ledamalekina senator just like oil, the truth does come up in the end and with the piece #OnFootInMau, you have been vindicated sir... 
Keep fighting and keep standing on the side of the truth, no matter what it takes...

You truly are an inspiration sir...
1093 2018-08-06 21:56:34 My first job out of school was for a company that "logged" oil wells. We'd show up when the driller hit the target depth. We'd send probes downhole to see if it would be a good well or a dud, and what depth they could find the most oil. We used radiation sources in the probes...
1094 2018-08-06 21:56:27 @alisoneroman OMG!  Grilled pork shoulder steaks!  I often schnitzel very thin pork chops with the bone in them; I wonder if I could cut this thin and schnitzel them.  Wondra Flour, beaten and strained eggs, panko.  Cooking in peanut oil.  YUM.  Any thoughts?

1096 2018-08-06 21:55:59 what could possibly go wrong. Should be entertaining to watch JT try to skate through this. Hint: Right thing to say but should have been done long ago before they took over our ports, grain and way before we jumped into bed with them with weapons. They can bury our oil industry
1097 2018-08-06 21:55:49 Dealership waiting for an oil change 
1098 2018-08-06 21:55:44 Can't say av ever had this problem funny tho as I ain't an oil painting yano
1099 2018-08-06 21:55:38 Was it imported Saudi or Iranian oil? There is a solution right here in Canada.

1107 2018-08-06 21:54:32 The doctor we are trying to get into is an oncologist,  it apparently they ship the oil from somewhere else. I have a friend that uses it for shoulder pain and he said it’s amazing,
1108 2018-08-06 21:54:24 So update: classes are registered & paid for. Don’t have to worry about that now. 
For sure more Rayman tomorrow(after I get my car oil changed)

1113 2018-08-06 21:53:53 For someone who takes a couple thousand mg of acetaminophen a day for pain (I know), I haven’t had to take any in two days because of CBD oil!!!! 
1114 2018-08-06 21:53:51 Welcome to Texas
1115 2018-08-06 21:53:49 Wieso sieht "Oil Pastel" mehr nach Bleistift aus als "Pencil"? Das ergibt keinen Sinn.
1116 2018-08-06 21:53:45 if they listen to what i'm saying we will be just fine. stop taking oil out of the ground it is the floater and the balancer of earth.oil keeps earth above water and keeps earth balanced by moving under earth where is needed.if you don't stop earth will slow down and get warm .
1117 2018-08-06 21:53:40 I personally don’t believe in banning snake oil salesmen like Alex Jones, it simply makes him a martyr in the deluded eyes of his followers and will no doubt be used to silence more voices on the left than actual fascists
1118 2018-08-06 21:53:26 “I know how to change the oil, I know how to mix the gas” 
1119 2018-08-06 21:53:18 Trump, you are so deranged.  So much smoke and mirrors!  Your the original snake oil salesman.
1120 2018-08-06 21:53:15 I take CBD ( oil ) for my anxiety & depression. After 18years of Meds ( Xanax, valium, and co.) I've stop all of them ( and coffee ans tobacco) in 3 month. Strengh to ur son ( sorry for my english, I'm french and don't speak too much english everyday^^ )
1121 2018-08-06 21:53:10 --  the leather-bound handles tattered and stained with sweat and oil.

His hands moved in a blur and time became a meaningless, abstract construct as he worked, all the hunger or exhaustion that always seemed to plague him simply gone, shoved away as the task at hand --
1122 2018-08-06 21:53:02 Sigh. Used to work so well for me! The past few years it only increases my anxiety to the point of full-blown panic attacks. Tried all the strains, oil, edibles. I miss the ganja!!
1123 2018-08-06 21:52:57 my hair really grew with these braids, keepin them moisturized & this black castor oil is AMAZING. 
1124 2018-08-06 21:52:44 And those hardworking Koch brothers...  And the football team owners...  And oil men, an Sheldon Adelson and aot of other rich people who get the economically down trodden fired up against their own interests.  But I get your point.

1126 2018-08-06 21:52:20 What’s best thing to do is to stop importing Saudi’s oil and gas and start using our own in the province of Alberta. @jkenney warned stupid liberals about this issue a long time ago. I don’t think Canada needs Saudi Arabia for anything 
1127 2018-08-06 21:52:06 Where were your voices in the past 60 years???
You like how we went to fight wars we had no business in??
You like how innocent people died for oil? Plastic? Rubber?
Is a synthetic material worth lives? WHERE WAS YOUR WEAK ASS VOICE THEN?
You need to check your loyalty soldier.
1128 2018-08-06 21:51:57 Y’all, Body Shop’s Tea Tree oil line is the business
1129 2018-08-06 21:51:55 The reason is they sell oil....
1130 2018-08-06 21:51:44 Gutom na rin ako eh,  pengeng cooking oil jan HAHAHAHA
1131 2018-08-06 21:51:36 You again? Stick to selling the snake oil
1132 2018-08-06 21:51:22 Saudi has the largest oil field in the world. Trump won’t act or say a word against Saudi Arabia, because he’s in their pocket, along with Russia.
1133 2018-08-06 21:50:58 Oh and don’t forget black seed oil.  That’s my holy grail
1134 2018-08-06 21:50:51 We only want to win like Denmark, wisely use our Oil revenue like Norway, and we wish our neighbour well, like 27 other EU counties.

Personally, I wish England had its own Government, and Regional Assemblies.  Instead of blaming the EU.
1135 2018-08-06 21:50:36 That went well for Oil Slick.
1136 2018-08-06 21:50:24 He cocked his head to one side, examining the ragged gash in the metal, looking at it from every angle. 

Dark oil and grease seeped from the crushed guts of the car, pooling on the ground of the garage, indistinguishable against the filthy surface. 

A wide grin split --
1137 2018-08-06 21:50:24 We can buy the oil now, but the offices are so busy.
1138 2018-08-06 21:50:22 Demola, the oil on your head is precious!
1139 2018-08-06 21:50:18 Don’t you buy all your oil from them so you can keep yours in the ground? What happens now?
1140 2018-08-06 21:50:09 ليه واطي .ده معرصيابو هاشم
1141 2018-08-06 21:50:04 My only problem is that I'd like to buy white air forces and I drive a moped and it spills oil all over my shoes so it'd sort of ruin them
1142 2018-08-06 21:50:02 Take it back to that place and tell them this is what happen after ya did an oil change and engine flush and let them figure it out
1143 2018-08-06 21:50:01 I never watched mad max, but incitement of violence in any case is bad, including when it comes from a vociferous, snake oil dealer like Jones. 

He makes his money on victimhood. This ban is probably going to make him money, because rubes eat fear up.
1144 2018-08-06 21:50:00 This is about the oil sands. Saudi Arabia sponsored the environmental groups which have hurt our exporting our oil to markets. That subterfuge worked really well. If SA wants to openly feud with us it means Canadians won't ignore or tolerate their fuckery. Win for Canada.

1152 2018-08-06 21:49:09 Casual convo with a friend of mine and I mentioned I needed to go get my tires rotated and and oil change.... then I proceed to ask about the status of her shit
1153 2018-08-06 21:49:01 This is getting beyond ridiculous. This will be our 3rd outage or maybe four in the past few days here in Oil Springs.
1154 2018-08-06 21:48:55 Read as "we want your oil since we turned off our nuclear power..." Their values are so high and transparent.
1155 2018-08-06 21:48:55 My skincare routine: slathering as much olive oil on my face as humanly possible. Multiple times a day.
1156 2018-08-06 21:48:33 - Diversification of the #economy from over over dependence on Oil to other sectors like Agric, steal,solid mineral, international trade, manufacturing etc- you can’t revolutionize an Economy without providing basic raw materials for the industries!
1157 2018-08-06 21:48:27 That’s good! Also with aubergine and onion, with olive oil. Yeah I can’t afford to get hungry now...
1158 2018-08-06 21:48:23 If Putin is Trumps boss, then you have to believe that Putin wants:
1) Ukrainian soldiers armed
2) Germany to reduce depenence on Russian oil
3) Missile defence deployed in Poland
4) Iran sanctions
5) NATO defence spending increased, and
6) Russian soldiers killed in Syria
1159 2018-08-06 21:48:20 Only problem is Joe, we have our own resources, we just would rather import dirty oil from terrorists countries like SA, Trudeau is a big hypocrite, doing all this for votes,  he’s a groper did you know? Look it up, calls himself a feminist, it’s a joke
1160 2018-08-06 21:48:13 Saudi Arabia sent many letters to the West, including the expulsion of the US ambassador in 1989 and the prevention of oil exports after the tripartite aggression against Egypt
1161 2018-08-06 21:48:02 Oh, now that is quite a genius idea. Oil and rust being good for growing trees?

1166 2018-08-06 21:47:07 Watch Exxon This Week
ExxonMobil is close to discovering huge oil reserves in Pakistan near the border with Iran, and those reserves could even be larger than the oil reserves of Kuwait, the Pakistani Minister Abdullah Hussain Haroon, said over the weekend.
1167 2018-08-06 21:47:06 Agreed! Those and metal slivers. One sliver will stop me in my tracks faster than a laceration.
1168 2018-08-06 21:46:59 I’ve heard some say they loathe  @JoeyRyanOnline for oiling and glistening himself in the ring which is just mind boggling to me! I mean a lot of wrestlers oil themselves up before their entrance, so what’s the difference if Joey Ryan does it backstage or shares it with the fans?
1169 2018-08-06 21:46:53 Save money, change your own oil.
1170 2018-08-06 21:46:48 i just got $40 off my oil change because the manager thought i was cute #happymonday
1171 2018-08-06 21:46:38 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1172 2018-08-06 21:46:26 When the company debuts on the publicly traded equities market we will be positioned to have a superior margin generator that can effectively be productized and applied to thousands of potential oil and gas operators in the US.  #invest #gas #oil #renewable #getfunded

1175 2018-08-06 21:46:21 the punchline here is that during one of our 80s superdroughts a Canadian businessman tried to sell Canadian water to California (shipped via oil tanker) but the Canadian government nixed it bc our history if water wars with Mexico SO LIKE
1176 2018-08-06 21:46:16 more oil for me
1177 2018-08-06 21:46:14 It's a question of what we can afford, and how to best spend the money. Canada is running up a deficit that our children will have to pay off. You can't be all things to all people. Well, perhaps if we had three or four pipelines and a booming oil industry. We don't. We are broke
1178 2018-08-06 21:46:09 Saudi Arabia is the greatest terror supporting regime all over the world. Caused 9/11 - supported AQ ISID and Al NUSRA - they are killing tens of thousands innocent people in Yemen - every country which has still a relationship with these morons because of cheap oil is part of it

1187 2018-08-06 21:45:05 What is becoming clear since Trump was elected is that the US oil companies are telling Netanyahu's govt what to do.  Getting rid of a UK Labour Party leader who speaks up for Palestinian rights is part of that.
1188 2018-08-06 21:45:03 I don’t know if their cbd has as much cbd in them though youd be best trying from the cbd shop Belfast they’ve a range of different products, the oil does taste rotten but you just hold your nose and take a drink after

1196 2018-08-06 21:44:09 I hope it doesn’t rain this weekend bc I really wanna get my car an oil change with a wash and detail to top it off.
1197 2018-08-06 21:44:08 Nah, thanks. Keep your oil, money and your students. Canadians will be just fine. We don't need the Saudis.
1198 2018-08-06 21:44:07 They are just running out of money. That might be the real reason.
To fund the bombings of Yemen with the oil price so low...

1201 2018-08-06 21:43:47 It was all over the press. Shall I try to find other articles on it for you? IScotland would probably have a JUNK credit rating because of its very high deficit and oil now being worth pretty much nothing. Please try to connect with reality. Not ‘SNP reality’ but the truth.

1204 2018-08-06 21:43:15 I understand the Basra oil thingy is big :)) I can tell you the modus operandi of Pax Americana in Romania: they couldn't care less if we die in our hospitals bc of lack of funding, all they care is regional security and safety of resources. But I'm ok with that!
1205 2018-08-06 21:43:14 The solution here is antitrust law, my friend, not conflating private and government entities. 

And if you don't think those in power could grow enough of a spine to go after a mega-monopoly, read Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States. The Justice Dept ... 1/2

1213 2018-08-06 21:42:19 Goodness me. Tbh some of the climate deniers and Petrolheads I have been up against recently would not surprise me in least if didn’t originate from either Russia or big oil companies.
1214 2018-08-06 21:42:17 Thanks to the extra virgin olive oil (#EVOO) from Spain you can cook an omelet in so many ways! What's your favorite for breakfast? 
1215 2018-08-06 21:42:12 JT cancelled Energy East and therefore Canada is still buying Saudi oil.
 
Mixed message ... right?
1216 2018-08-06 21:42:05 @perplexed_ustaz can bear me witness ,he was live and direct.
1217 2018-08-06 21:41:56 Did the math on that one. We only buy 63,000 barrels a day from Saudi, tops. That's nothing. We produce 3.9 Million barrels per day. We have the third largest proven oil reserves in the world and are the fourth largest producer.  So we  load up a few more trains per day.
1218 2018-08-06 21:41:50 AND oil
1219 2018-08-06 21:41:49 What about the shows that push the War for Oil lie, don’t you think that could be horribly offensive to families of fallen soldiers? Should we ban those shows too?
1220 2018-08-06 21:41:38 Our government criticized your government for arresting political activists.  Sorry if that bothers you... but we actually DO believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  The only reason you have no homeless is because you have an ungodly amount of income from oil.
1221 2018-08-06 21:41:31 Joel lives an extremely extravagant lifestyle. He is a snake oil salesman who depends on the ignorance of gullible people. Most Americans are not GOP. Whatever happened to the separation of Church and State? Trump. He found his suckers.
1222 2018-08-06 21:41:29 If @Canada can’t trade with Saudi Arabia, does that mean Canadians will actually buy, refine and use Canadian crude oil?? Of course not!!! That would make to much sense.  #cdnpoli
1223 2018-08-06 21:41:29 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1224 2018-08-06 21:41:28 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1225 2018-08-06 21:41:20 The @NGRPresident isnt criminalizing illegal artisinal miners in the north, but gave them a 5 billion fund last year but will criminalize the crude oil miners in the south-south and term them as saboteurs.
1226 2018-08-06 21:40:58 OYAAAAAA ohhhhh come and buy beard oil
1227 2018-08-06 21:40:54 But where will I get my survival seeds, Alpha Male water, anti-gay frog pills from now!? 
Free speech can go take a hike we all know this is about Globalists busting Alex's extremely profitable, not really medical, not really effective snake oil industry.
1228 2018-08-06 21:40:47 Predictable conservative about-face. Now favours Saudi oil that yesterday they asking us to build a pipeline to avoid. Hasn't go the message that it is the fossil fuel industry that has the country burning.
1229 2018-08-06 21:40:47 Its insane to think Canada imports something like $2 billion or more in Oil from Saudi Arabia.
We should be cutting off ties with this backwards murderous regime.
1230 2018-08-06 21:40:34 Got a heat advisory email from @BMW saying I should get my car checked. (Returned the car 26-July) Reminds me of when @Ford would send me coupons for oil changes. (Electric cars don't use oil)

1236 2018-08-06 21:40:03 Put the jar of coconut oil in my microwave to thaw it a little... my whole microwave just LITERALLY had flames coming out the side. & my coconut oil is still rock solid. Mondays I swear
1237 2018-08-06 21:40:02 The guy at autozone made fun of the way i said oil :(
1238 2018-08-06 21:39:54 Check again. Oil and gas subsidies are in the trillions.
1239 2018-08-06 21:39:50 This organized criminal machine has been built  before Trump was around, a lot of this well-built oil machine as you call it has been built with OLD MONEY, it can go far back as the slavery era the early 1800s and has been building up to the year of 2018 
1240 2018-08-06 21:39:48 Is it about time for Canada to rely on Canadian oil yet?  Eh folks?  . In fairness they apologized & took the plane out of the tweet.  But message received none the less.
1241 2018-08-06 21:39:45 Let's stop importing oil from them as well and up our production and refining. While we are at it Iran sponsoring terror should be called out also. Let's stop trading with these nations along with importing barbaric and oppressive cultural practices.
1242 2018-08-06 21:39:37 That is s LOT of reporters in the oil fields!
1243 2018-08-06 21:39:34 His truck is leaking mad oil
1244 2018-08-06 21:39:31 And yet, Canada enjoys a significantly higher GDP than that of Saudi Arabia, and ranks 1st in Quality of Life and overtakes Saudi Arabia in almost every global ranking.

We don't need your Oil, money and neither do we need your Foreign Students.
1245 2018-08-06 21:39:30 I’m the only one at this jiffy lube, let’s see if they really do oil changes in 15 minutes
1246 2018-08-06 21:39:29 every third full moon, when DonaldTrump has a toddler tantrum, a depressed snail cries for mama #resist
1247 2018-08-06 21:39:23 Just show them our oil proceeds. Let them do the math. We were rich in the 70's but that ship has sailed a long time ago. 
Now we're a country with potential managed by greedy, old aristocrats.
1248 2018-08-06 21:39:22 Ostrich oil or snake oil?
1249 2018-08-06 21:39:21 #VotingRightsAct The Civil Rights Act oil 1964 and The voting Rights Act of 1965 are two of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed. We The People of The United States. All of the people. We can’t slide back. Racism can’t win #TheResistance
1250 2018-08-06 21:39:18 Hahaha the funny/sad thing is that my clothes and backpack literally smell like fryer grease from work, always, and I’m sure it would be quite appealing. Hopefully the scary noises from my bike outweigh the lure of used vegetable oil 
1251 2018-08-06 21:39:16 but they will, and sell us their environmental "dirty" oil
@cathmckenna 
Your thoughts?
Like , um, ah , straws!
1252 2018-08-06 21:39:09 All trade suspended means no oil.
1253 2018-08-06 21:39:00 OMGGGGG
1254 2018-08-06 21:38:53 I mean the people who created these conflicts. They're stupid. They're preventing us from expressing ourselves. 

And you say his Tweet puts oil on the fire. So she can't express what she think because of the conflicts between some people . It's too bad.
1255 2018-08-06 21:38:53 Dark haired girls, if you've never used amla oil in your hair over night you need to get to know. Trust me on this 
1256 2018-08-06 21:38:38 Heard Vegetable oil helps 
1257 2018-08-06 21:38:29 Even anointing oil can't cleanse your sins 
1258 2018-08-06 21:38:20 Hmmmmn. 

Oya come and buy beard oil.
1259 2018-08-06 21:38:19 China is not a market economy, and the government is quick to interfere in the workings of the local commodity markets on any suspicion of a bubble coming.

To prevent such a bubble in oil the authorities mad sure the contract will trade within a set band of 5 percent either side
1260 2018-08-06 21:38:16 Yes I can. If the oil barons lose interest then its different. While they have money to burn they'll always be contenders.
1261 2018-08-06 21:38:13 Trump wants to sell more gas. Now that he owns 19.5 % Rosneft Oil, a Russian oil company that rewarded Trump shares for his "cooperation" in the 2016 US election.
1262 2018-08-06 21:38:08 I will comment when l hv my 1st degree on this cooking oil crayon challenge l min #chigumbachallenge for nw lm just reading the comments.lm still on extra lessons

1265 2018-08-06 21:37:35 Maybe the KSA just did for us what we couldn't do for ourselves? Force us to rely more on Canadian oil, @JustinTrudeau. Damn fool.
1266 2018-08-06 21:37:32 Y’all really be listening to all those skincare threads when the only thing you need is pure rosehip oil :)
1267 2018-08-06 21:37:28 Doesn't the US also have about 9 military bases still in East Syria?  Mainly to deprive Syria of oil rich areas and agricultural land in their own country???  They are the uninvited party and that should be the discussion rather than the Russians being in Syria.
1268 2018-08-06 21:37:21 So maybe now would be a great time to start using  the statement #buylocal #supportlocal for our own canadian oil industry. But I'm betting the #liberals will find it much more benifical to their narrative to just simply buy more oil from say Iran or Venezuela.

1270 2018-08-06 21:37:05 Apparently inciting violence, harassing shooting victims, selling snake oil, libel and slander are wrong think. 
1271 2018-08-06 21:36:56 I'm mad she said "change oil" like it ain't free literacy everywhere 
1272 2018-08-06 21:36:37 in 100, 200, 500 years. Coal and oil won't be here in 100 years. But who cares?
1273 2018-08-06 21:36:33 It’s time for Canada to use our own oil first...all of it
Instead of buying it from places like the Saudi
1274 2018-08-06 21:36:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
1275 2018-08-06 21:36:30 I do that a lot but one of my bros dey cook Indomie with red oil me dey reason say na Higher Killer him be
1276 2018-08-06 21:36:23 Maybe you should pressure the Saudi regime likewise...that would be fair. But this is not what the US stands for, right? Not if it comes to oil.
1277 2018-08-06 21:36:21 we’re getting johns oil changed and i can hear the employees talking to themselves abt how old the car is and that they dont know what parts to use for stuff

1280 2018-08-06 21:36:13 IBB remains my hero cone rain come shine. Which government has done even half of third mainland bridge since he left office. Built Abuja when crude oil was sold for nothing.  Today despite the billions and trillions, they end up doing nothing. IBB, posterity shall announce you.
1281 2018-08-06 21:36:11 Why does cbd oil taste like death
1282 2018-08-06 21:36:07 Who’s the journalist? If it’s Hirst, I’m pretty sure he’s on an oil bung from Citeh. Constantly peddling the anti Utd-Mourinho agenda.
1283 2018-08-06 21:36:00 I think that a democratic , oil importer full state owned energy has alot of motivation to move to a more effective energy Network. At worst corruption  /slow adoption scenario as soon as other countries have successfully adopte It , the pression from public to adopt will sufice
1284 2018-08-06 21:35:56 And the oil interests have never done anything to hold back the adaption of alternative energy.
Oh, and they haven't ever lobbied governments to keep giving oil subsidies nor have they ever discouraged governments from granting subsidies to speed the advent of clean energy...
1285 2018-08-06 21:35:53 Do you thirst for oil?
Well I have a lot and I do not need
Do you want a little? 
1286 2018-08-06 21:35:47 I've never done that before, usually I drizzle with olive oil and maybe some croutons.
1287 2018-08-06 21:35:40 We need more American oil companies. So we have a reason to fight for freedoms. #oilisfreedom #gasisgold I also rub @realDonaldTrump down with oil every day for Tanning sessions as he says his wife’s hands are too soft and cold.
1288 2018-08-06 21:35:25 Easy enough for Saudi to sell their oil elsewhere (and for us to buy elsewhere).  Much will depend upon what our liberal democratic allies do.  If they accept the students being ‘transferred’ and don’t sanction Saudi, they are setting a dangerous precedent.
1289 2018-08-06 21:35:19 Awesome recipe: Argentinian pan.  Ingredients: green fresh/chopped bean, and oil.

1293 2018-08-06 21:34:57 Melanie, if you're so worried about your tax dollars, may I direct your attention to the literal billions of dollars that is planned on being spent on buying an oil pipeline that's going directly into a private corporation's pocket.
1294 2018-08-06 21:34:56 I'm not selling snake oil so i'm good
1295 2018-08-06 21:34:54 Just a friendly reminder that the UK is a hellscape. In an independent Scotland, unicorns will roam free and drink from natural springs of whisky, and every citizen will get free oil.
1296 2018-08-06 21:34:48 China’s yuan-denominated crude oil futures launched March 26 in Shanghai with 15.4 million barrels of crude for delivery in September.

1298 2018-08-06 21:34:41 I use coconut oil, works like a charm.
1299 2018-08-06 21:34:30 Only thing about this is that if buying and trading from/with oil producing nations was premised on human rights.  Well the only other source of "clean", so to speak, oil other than Canada would be Norway.
1300 2018-08-06 21:34:21 Oil .. what do think I am a degenerate?
1301 2018-08-06 21:34:18 I used coconut oil and left it on overnight

1305 2018-08-06 21:33:07 dang i gotta try that im surprised it didnt just taste like microwaved cheese where all the oil separates out
1306 2018-08-06 21:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
1307 2018-08-06 21:32:59 Exactly. We must all speak out against the Corrupt House of Saud. One reason to move to renewables, the Fascist state of Saudi Arabia can keep its oil in the ground.  #Saudi
1308 2018-08-06 21:32:55 This is why Canada is a widely loved and admired country and Saudi Arabia is a backward and repugnant entity saved only by its oil. Go

1322 2018-08-06 21:31:23 All of my twitter ads this month have been climate denial/oil shills disguised as news, and something about 3rd world countries using block chain to trade solar power for bitcoin.

My sense of humor might be sabotaging my opsec.
1323 2018-08-06 21:31:23 Don't you have enough problems here in Canada starting with photo boy JT?  Highway of Tears?  Alienating USA and now KSA?  You had better get that Northern Gateway pipeline going before you loose the Saudi oil.  Do you know Ontario is burning?  And BC

1329 2018-08-06 21:31:06 Info Wars getting kicked off of every where is actually great. Alex Jones is a scumbag snake oil salesman who has taken part in the doxxing and harassment of several people, as well as suing the family's of the victims of Sandy Hook. I'm glad the only kid he has left is PJW.

1339 2018-08-06 21:29:55 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil 
1340 2018-08-06 21:29:54 Oil is not renewable, water is.
1341 2018-08-06 21:29:52 Angola has the world's 17th largest crude oil reserves.
1342 2018-08-06 21:29:49 Liberals pander to Islam and protect it at every turn.  A religion that is known to treat women as second class citizens. They continue to buy oil from Saudi Arabia strengthening their economy while criticizing  oil.   I just don’t get it either.

1345 2018-08-06 21:29:25 Not likely they will run out. But if we could get more of our oil to market we could compete with them as oil producers buy being sellers instead of buyers. Don't understand why people don't get that.
1346 2018-08-06 21:29:11 The problem with the NY Times Magazine piece is that it blames this on unnamed, generalized neglect and inaction rather than on the oil and gas and coal billionaire execs and the local, state, and federal government representatives who are in their pockets
1347 2018-08-06 21:29:06 Why doesn’t he change your oil for you?
1348 2018-08-06 21:29:05 And in the US Oboma tried to stop pipelines forcing more oil onto our roads.

1354 2018-08-06 21:28:20 has 2/3 kinds of olive oil in the house already 
1355 2018-08-06 21:28:17 Good grief, did all forget that the Liberals forgot to build those pipe lines from Alberta? Even Oboma had sense enough to make his country self sufficient in oil. So, kill the imports, let our east coast freeze on the dark?
1356 2018-08-06 21:28:14 The most ridiculous pro oil statement I have read every was posted today. "Less pride parades more pipeline built" 

As if they are even remotely in the same category. Smh
1357 2018-08-06 21:28:05 made some snacks using coconut oil today and let me tell you my hands smell fantastic.
1358 2018-08-06 21:28:01 Go ahead and shut off the soy....we will close the oil tap and the Steel...both of which Canada is the US’s #1 supplier.  Not to also forget the power from our hydro facilities.  You are dumber than a stump. Alienate the world and see us leave you out in the cold.
1359 2018-08-06 21:27:49 I’ll always come up when asked, but not just to do an oil change!!!
1360 2018-08-06 21:27:38 Put spinach and kale in my salad today. I’ve got Quinoa on the stove and am using avocado oil as salad dressing. This fit tummy tea money shall be all mine
1361 2018-08-06 21:27:37 CBD Oil!!! And lots of it. Ol Igor has 1st hand knowledge.  DM me anyone w/any questions Id be happy to share experiences.Good luck Pinky
1362 2018-08-06 21:27:35 lmao wasn’t expecting to pay $96 for an oil change
1363 2018-08-06 21:27:05 Just bring an oil pen in your makeup case
1364 2018-08-06 21:27:02 I really hope this doesn't affect the ability for Saudi Arabia to get deals in Europe and Africa for oil going forward. We need to keep those agreements in place so that those nations don't need to look to democracies elsewhere.
1365 2018-08-06 21:26:59 If pallm oil is now on top, it means you cannot wake up to sanity 
1366 2018-08-06 21:26:58 Coconut oil is the oneee for long thick hair 
1367 2018-08-06 21:26:53 Debts in foreign currency is.  Also, unlike Norway, Ven didn’t use its oil wealth to diversify its economy so is experiencing severe shortages of goods.  Etc....
1368 2018-08-06 21:26:41 Sitting at the shop waiting for an oil change to get done on my Jeep and suddenly my music from my headphones goes silent and starts blasting from the speakers in the jeep.... The mechanics asked if I can turn it up, they love the Foo Fighters 
1369 2018-08-06 21:26:37 The squeaky wheel gets the oil as they say
1370 2018-08-06 21:26:35 Protein, BCAA’S, Fat burner. Multi Vitamins, fish oil, vitamin D/calcium and probiotics.
1371 2018-08-06 21:26:28 Google said oil changes take less than an hour, so why have I been waiting for 66 mins
1372 2018-08-06 21:26:28 Had a shower at my mam's house last week. I used her Palmer's Baby Oil afterwards. She wouldn't let me take it. I've not stopped thinking about it. 

Just got out of bed, hired a car and drove to Asda so that I could buy it.

Follow your dreams kids.
1373 2018-08-06 21:26:28 See you at Brainerd! At 31 years old, it’ll be my 21st year of going to the Lucas Oil Nationals!  @BIRrace #nevergetsold
1374 2018-08-06 21:26:09 It's ok, we have lots of oil in Alberta. :)
1375 2018-08-06 21:26:05 Big businesses just dont know what millennials want, but thats okay, here's a list for them:
Egg flavored candy
Edible dish cloths
Soap that doubles as a healthy oil alternative 
Circular smartphones
Get to work, you capitalist monkeys
1376 2018-08-06 21:26:04 love to smear argan oil all over my deserving ass body
1377 2018-08-06 21:26:01 You should (if you haven’t already) try it with the hangover primer! I feel this is the best combo to control oil. Also, the less you use the better. One pump is just enough
1378 2018-08-06 21:25:58 The US will take many. It’s an indictment on America’s dependence on Saudi oil and the horrible state of higher education in Saudi Arabia.
1379 2018-08-06 21:25:58 Funny, no mention on the CBC National news about the $2.3 billion per year spent on Saudi oil imports.  Details on exports but no details on imports.

1382 2018-08-06 21:25:30 Nahhh! "It wasn't dinner exactly! We had small plates, ya know, tapas! And then some pupu and after we sipped a fine gun oil."
1383 2018-08-06 21:25:21 We have the most Oil .  Let's build more LNG ports all over the world
1384 2018-08-06 21:25:14 Canada imports oil from Saudi Arabia and shuns Alberta oil because Alberta is morally bad AND it gets the liberals votes.
Get a life you hypocrites!
@AndrewScheer @jkenney @PremierScottMoe @RachelNotley
1385 2018-08-06 21:25:09 I have 3 - $25 gift cards available :) Do you want to try CBD oil or Black seed oil ? Comment below 
1386 2018-08-06 21:25:03 No discount, but if you bleed all over the car you’ll get a complimentary cleaning fee. 
1387 2018-08-06 21:24:58 Venezuela has more oil per capita.  That’s part of the reason comparing Ven & Norway is a good excercise.  Good governance seems to count for a lot - whether a country leans towards socialism or capitalism.  Of course all economies are a mix.
1388 2018-08-06 21:24:57 Most of us that were into unionism at undergrad days had such experiences. But yours and a couple of others that I've heard is most serious. Praise be to Allah we're now all done!
1389 2018-08-06 21:24:45 Only @sarahjeong.
1390 2018-08-06 21:24:28 kaisha message me talking about some grow oil  love her 
1391 2018-08-06 21:24:09 There's a lot of Wisconsin flying W's out there among the high schools as well as their old standing W from the 80s.

Maybe I'll write a column about high school helmets? Have you ever seen the HS helmet display at Lucas Oil? It's pretty awesome.
1392 2018-08-06 21:24:06 Perhaps fungus might be involved too? Some fungus nurture saplings, since they need decomposing leafs to feed on, and I've noticed that for example linseed oil spilled on grass made fungus grow like crazy a year later. Don't know if old car-oil would have that effect though?
1393 2018-08-06 21:24:06 The world will find more oil, the reason you will not get more oil is because you will also get declines in older fields. So, 85 to 100 Million Barrels is about it.
1394 2018-08-06 21:23:58 When you have been conned it is hard to later admit to your self esteem that you have been fooled. It takes a major event to figure out that smooth nice guy who helps those in need is taking in big bucks from their victim(s) and selling snake oil.
1395 2018-08-06 21:23:56 Ouch!
1396 2018-08-06 21:23:24 Get me jars of coconut oil for my Birthday

1399 2018-08-06 21:23:05 They're good at English actually
1400 2018-08-06 21:23:02 You put gasoline in your car?
Do you have electricity in your home?

Making money from the production/sale of oil is far different than getting $$billions to "study" something that doesn't exist. and manipulating the public into "raising awareness" so the checks keep coming.
1401 2018-08-06 21:22:59 He is fine, rubbed some gun oil on his bruise and he is ready to go!
1402 2018-08-06 21:22:44 Oooo
1403 2018-08-06 21:22:37 Apparently no one in my office has ever caramelized onions before? Three people asked how much sugar I added? Like, no. Nothing was added to the onions except more onions. No butter, oil, salt, sugar, water - NOTHING. It is legit just several pounds of sliced onions.
1404 2018-08-06 21:22:29 He didn't decide, the people who aren't stupid enough to fall for snake oil salesmen and those peddling hate as a cure all have decided.
1405 2018-08-06 21:22:29 End oil subsidies
1406 2018-08-06 21:22:18 me: I need an oil change and an inspection
car place guy: you got it, do you got proof of insurance?

1408 2018-08-06 21:22:10 You still think twitter is a “right”?  . No one is infringing on his 1A rights. You can see all of his performances on his website for your continued amusement.  You can buy all the snake oil supplements you want from him.

1410 2018-08-06 21:21:59 He could sell some snake oil.
1411 2018-08-06 21:21:58 The other it was Palm oil and today, it is coconut oil.

1418 2018-08-06 21:20:55 Always crunchy with no added sugar and no palm oil.
1419 2018-08-06 21:20:51 Love this idea. I’ve been thinking about pulling my oil painting skills out and doing some nature / landscape pieces with my poetry on top ! X
1420 2018-08-06 21:20:48 Looks like a fun film with Classic John C comedy.  I still find myself humming Garret’s dirge version of Jonny where’s your trousers  from the Sarah Conner Chronicles. They look like the perfect oil and water pairing together.
1421 2018-08-06 21:20:47 do you know that standard oil was a real company? they owned about 95% of the oil industry and achieved that because every time a competitor popped up, they lowered prices immensely to bring all business back to them. their competition then went bankrupt.
1422 2018-08-06 21:20:45 Ahh the great Yorkshire oil and gas reserves 
1423 2018-08-06 21:20:38 You could just stay in the red states and help people change their oil in their houses
1424 2018-08-06 21:20:33 Being in Spain for almost a year really affected me because I religiously use olive oil with everything just like they do lol
1425 2018-08-06 21:20:28 Have you considered that you're actually just a snake oil salesman?
1426 2018-08-06 21:20:28 NOYB. after my years of artivism, protest and disclosure there are too many zionazicon, supremacist, banker big oil gang corp billionaire goons who want me gone. earth is where i reside.
1427 2018-08-06 21:20:28 Easy, without North Sea Oil, Norway is 3rd world.
1428 2018-08-06 21:20:18 La bi oil ! A mettre vraiment tous les jours (faut bien masser) mais surtout pas sur les boutons, vraiment que sur les tâches et tu laisses toute la nuit
1429 2018-08-06 21:20:13 I literally shaved mine off and let them regrow LOL I wouldn’t advise doing that tho. If u want them to get thicker then use castor oil. If you want them thinner just fill them in how you like them & pluck whatever hairs stand out
1430 2018-08-06 21:20:10 Ya girl tried to be domestic today and cook some dinner but spilled hot oil on her foot so it’s blistering

1435 2018-08-06 21:19:22 YouTube, Apple and Facebook are not the government.

Sorry you can't use these platforms to sell your snake oil anymore. 

Sucks to be you.
1436 2018-08-06 21:19:22 Too bad it’s tuna oil ie 0% true

1442 2018-08-06 21:18:53 Hey Texas White guy, stay out of areas you know absolutely nothing about! We don’t buy the snake oil anymore so move along, nothing for you to see here!
1443 2018-08-06 21:18:40 What a terrible burden Scotland has, having oil on its shores. Oh my, a terrible burden indeed. Too expensive to extract, too expensive to decommission etc etc ... may as well give it all to someone else to look after and take the profits then ... oh wait

1445 2018-08-06 21:18:28 .JT has enough of his own problems to solve right here, in Canada.  He better get a move on the NORTHERN PIPELINE because the east may find themselves out of oil.  I have no desire to pick a war with KSA, sacrifice Canadians for what?  Canada needs to look after her own problems.

@jeremycorbyn needs to man up and LEAD his party (that's his job). He has to stop bending and buckling and stick to his guns - normally he's very good at that.
1449 2018-08-06 21:18:17 Pake virgin oil, tapi bagus sih suntik anti scabiea
1450 2018-08-06 21:18:14 I'm in OK. Yes, CBD oil helps tremendously. I take it by edibles, under my tongue and I vape.
1451 2018-08-06 21:18:12 Efcc now investigate oil deals now?
1452 2018-08-06 21:18:06 Wish it was just an emotional outburst, but it’s not. I prefer liking Saudi than not, but it’s impossible not to consider it an enemy of humanity. Learn the facts on Yemen and Syria & research Saudi’s criminal record. One Yemeni child is worth more than your oil value.
1453 2018-08-06 21:17:54 My old roommate had a yellow lab and she was really great but oh my god he NEVER cleaned her and she was just a smelly fucking pile of grease I swear you could wring out her fur have enough oil to power a fuckin diesel car
1454 2018-08-06 21:17:46 We also have a saying in English: you’re a bunch of primitive savages with oil money and you are despised by even your Arab kin.
1455 2018-08-06 21:17:39 I am not splitting Canada over oil.

I want off it, but that bitumen has been extracted, so, sell it. Pay for the renewable energy. And build it!

1457 2018-08-06 21:17:24 Reuters said it best: Jones is a conspiracy theorist. Why buy the bullshit he’s spewing when he’s delusional at best or a snake oil salesman at worst?

1465 2018-08-06 21:17:02 The other week I heard about a oil tanker so massive it needed 5 miles of open water just to stop once it got going. I know it's cliche point to make by now but I've been thinking about that ship every time the DCCU comes up
1466 2018-08-06 21:16:40 Used to see that if the kitchen was too warm. Dough raises too fast and then air inside gets released. #flat 75-80 degrees was just right.
Donuts another story. Special Steam Tray warmers to fast rise things on racks that like Cinnamon Roll's (Deep Fried) Were submerged in oil.
1467 2018-08-06 21:16:32 I love drizzling 3 liters of olive oil over everything I eat

1477 2018-08-06 21:15:38 Ended up giving her a ginger bath oil to try because she said she loves ginger so much and bought a face mask. So I figure why not just give her a reason to use the face mask in a nice bath.
1478 2018-08-06 21:15:29 In this day & age, High prices = less customers. So if “standard oil”, would like to make a profit they’d better lower prices because a new cheaper alternative called electric hybrids will completely demolish them out of business if they ever tried to pull a fast one.

1484 2018-08-06 21:15:04 Why do we support them by buying their oil then?
1485 2018-08-06 21:14:49 And then the oil. I get sleepy when I use it so I take a little nap, then I'm good. But it really works. It's cut my need for pain meds in half.

1487 2018-08-06 21:14:26 May be true for the rich...aka normal people who haven’t gotten a raise or whose’tax cut’ givens then an extra 2 dollars a paycheck.   Oil and gas skyrocketing and you don’t give a care.  SAD!

1490 2018-08-06 21:14:05 It’s a peak day in New England: that means afternoon peak electricity demand that is 2x higher than the average day, peak electricity prices 10x higher, and lots more oil and gas on the grid. #ShaveThePeak
1491 2018-08-06 21:14:04 Oh...and no you are not about energy independence.  You're about money, money, money and we'll do any
anything to get it, by whatever means.  Someone needs to do some research on how many politicians are invested in oil.  What stocks they own & who owns those companies.
1492 2018-08-06 21:14:03 Okay I got the intake and exhaust off, the timing cover and the oil pan. Where do I begin ahah
1493 2018-08-06 21:14:01 It’s fuckin hot as hell today and I’m out here changing my own oil between jobs and jumping my coworkers car
1494 2018-08-06 21:13:54 not even man. when it comes to the gulf countries the government is buying the peoples approval rating by giving them money. but if they didnt have the oil money the gulf countries would be like northern africa and nobody there like their government lol

1498 2018-08-06 21:13:27 Canada's oil imports from SA are only 9% of the total. I'd think we could pretty easily increase exports from the US, where over 60% of our imports already comes from.
1499 2018-08-06 21:13:26 Thanks for taking the time to call out all the snake oil salespeople in the nutrition religion (I mean community). It's so exhausting to respond to all the misinformation when the purveyors of it are unencumbered by facts, evidence, or intellectual integrity.

1504 2018-08-06 21:13:11 Freedom in Canada and freedom in Saudi Arabia mean the polar opposite. Certainly it's even more pronounced in the female population. If Saudi Arabia didn't control the world oil, more countries would denounce their policies. The Western World needs oil so they turn a blind eye.

1508 2018-08-06 21:12:53 @GuyAdami why can’t China just buy oil from Russia, Iran & say screw all sanctions
1509 2018-08-06 21:12:47 Let's ditch the damn oil already
1510 2018-08-06 21:12:47 We are currently getting 100 Million barrels a day of oil worldwide and using it all. We will not be getting more. That is why prices can spike.

1513 2018-08-06 21:12:31 It’s disappointing that these snake oil salesmen we call ministers are able to change the narrative so those with less enquiring minds are accepting that the EU are bullying us. They aren’t, they have rules and principles that they have to stick to and they did say at the start.

1522 2018-08-06 21:11:39 they have nothing to lose, they are oil trillionaires. we have more to lose in terms of economic leverage and access to resources, investment. They are definitely sore losers, but they're getting away with it scott free.

1547 2018-08-06 21:09:12 Snake oil comes from 19th-century Chinese railroad workers who used medicine made from the Chinese water snake. The stuff worked; rich in Omega 3..The term took on new meaning when phony patent medicines promised to cure every disease known to man. Made up of mostly alcohol.

1559 2018-08-06 21:08:11 The pipeline east from Alberta is what should have been built.  Unfortunately a few voices in Quebec joined Denis Corderre and stopped it.  All this debate about a pipeline to the west coast is the wrong debate when we should be building east to supply Cdn provinces with Cdn oil.

1612 2018-08-06 21:02:50 Do they truly believe the rest of the world doesn't know of their complicity in terrorism? Oil has what's protected them to date. Certainly not lack of knowledge.

1615 2018-08-06 21:02:21 The Saudi’s released a bunch of oil reserves to flood the market causing oil prices to fall so this may be good for Canadian oil markets.
1616 2018-08-06 21:02:15 I’m not even joking: use electric vehicles, ride electric transport, buy electric cars...whatever we can do to make the switch. We have to start hitting them where it hurts. And our petrol needs in Canada should be refined in Alberta and used here. ZERO Saudi oil in Canada.

1633 2018-08-06 21:00:54 Maggie,
You're determined to display your bias. Why do oil companies keep bidding for the right to drill? There is plenty oil west of Shetland. Off the west coast round the Clyde is similar in nature & just as likely to contain oil & gas. Ask an expert or just Google B4 tweeting.

1643 2018-08-06 21:00:27 August 06, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1644 2018-08-06 21:00:26  Wai "Two grammar Nazis" ...Haba, be nice mana
1645 2018-08-06 21:00:26 Last time I looked, Canada was a net exporter of electricity, oil, gas. If your words are a plug for pipelines, they are off the mark. I believe in a strong, INDEPENDENT military, not one to follow US command like a puppy in NATO, NORAD. But that’s not what you mean. #cdnpoli
1646 2018-08-06 21:00:20 We have veto on things we don't like. EU don't set criminal laws just trading regs that oil the wheels of business (that then pays the taxes that provide our services). UK has shaped the direction of the EU. Far better to stay in and influence from inside than lose free trade.
1647 2018-08-06 21:00:14 Semi was following the oil tanker too close... rear ends  it and THREE semis were demolished in a huge fireball.  

PEOPLE... please, do not follow too close!!!  I'm a crash analyst and 90% of the crashes are because of this!
1648 2018-08-06 21:00:13 Apparently it’s a suspension for future trade, so the Saudi’s will continue to let us buy oil from them that we don’t need. Oil that we could replace with Canadian oil.
1649 2018-08-06 21:00:11 He should be fine to transport if he’s not crying or trembling.  Would highly suggest keeping an eye on him while in the car.  You can cover it with cloth but make sure it’s clean and the wound is dry from the coconut oil.  Your vet should recommend...
1650 2018-08-06 21:00:07 Mmm incorrect! Actually your wrong as well. Im not confused at all, im very aware of Canada’s capabilities and strength. You my friend on the other hand need to get your facts straight. Canada is the second largest country in the world with oil sand and the richest with water etc
1651 2018-08-06 21:00:02 And while you might know this, there was a major ethanol train derailment and fire in New Brighton in October 2006 and a derailment with a crude oil spill in Vandergrift in February 2014.
1652 2018-08-06 20:59:59 Must be referring to the Ogun people's struggle against pollution of their area by She'll oil company.
1653 2018-08-06 20:59:54 Here’s an idea... maybe the PM should send a tearful apology, like he’s done to every other group that we’ve pissed off over the past  couple hundred years.  And then grow some bollocks and put a quick stop to importing Middle East oil. #PoliticsSuck #PMTrudeau
1654 2018-08-06 20:59:18 Protectionist policy?
1655 2018-08-06 20:59:13 Some say when he farts it smells like oil #someSay
1656 2018-08-06 20:59:09 AH, HA! I knew coconut oil can be useful for something other than cooking!
1657 2018-08-06 20:59:06 LOL it's not that there is too much cash. It's that it is hyper inflated thru 1) blackmarket 2) oil embargo & Opec fixing 3) propaganda war & lost in faith of currency etc etc....FYI I am a capitalist who understands propaganda wars. Guess the ole Koch brothers wanted a fire sale
1658 2018-08-06 20:58:52 #EnergyEast would have curtailed our appetite for OPEC (Saudi) oil & reduced tankers on our east coast. But our #PMO only seems offended by west coast tankers.
1659 2018-08-06 20:58:44 He is so useless and stupid. Why don’t @realDonaldTrump get out there and fight some fires,  and stop deregulating everything for his oil, coal and gas donors ?  People and animals died, lives were destroyed! This will just keep happening if don’t change our way of life.
1660 2018-08-06 20:58:38 It’s 100 degrees in the shade but the crew at the Southaven, MS @Valvoline Instant Oil Change is awesome! Thanks y’all. They keep @3onyourside on the road.

1667 2018-08-06 20:57:24 Good reason to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and instead focus on our own oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We don't need oil from this country.

1670 2018-08-06 20:57:23 @BMW_UK Purchased an approved R1200GS from Williams Manchester. Faulty oil seals due to badly fitted recall repair , manifold valve stuck open, service indicator not set properly and panniers came loose on M1.  Dealer didn't call back and BMW fail to respond to mail. Never again.

1672 2018-08-06 20:57:16 Wrap a bandage around the wound to transport him. It'll keep the Coconut Oil on him longer and won't make a mess in your car.
1673 2018-08-06 20:57:14 Glad this quarter waiting for the first person to complain about and what is this person for real and I have a garage now
Not cool: using it to last more than 2 quarts of oil pooled in the pizza guy double standard.
1674 2018-08-06 20:57:03 Why does Trump want to do away with the emissions and fuel mileage regulations? I don't know a single person who would be mad if their car was getting 50 mpg.
I do know of a few oil executives who want you to buy as much fuel as humanly possible though...

1685 2018-08-06 20:56:03 Slow deep inhale - exhale. Lavender aromatherapy  oil is very calming, as is lavender candles etc 
1686 2018-08-06 20:55:48 Yes. Ask Norfolk Southern and PEMA if that’s the route for oil and ethanol trains.
1687 2018-08-06 20:55:44 Oil and water
1688 2018-08-06 20:55:41 There was a car wash included with my oil change and that lasted all of 15 mins before it started raining

1694 2018-08-06 20:55:14 I’ve been using coconut oil as deodorant and lemme tell u it is NOT working
1695 2018-08-06 20:55:13 So true why as a country are we allowing a portion of our country to import oil instead of using our resources (BC, AB, SK, Nfld). And yet these other provinces also get equalization payments which we could just offset with oil deliveries. Talk about wasting money #cdngov #change
1696 2018-08-06 20:55:08 Nope. You alone are Alex Jones, fabricator of lies, profiting off hate-filled rants and snake oil supplements. #TryHumanity #TryCompassion If you cannot muster either, try silence. Meditate on the pain you’ve  wrought on families already suffering thru their darkest hour. #Shame
1697 2018-08-06 20:54:49 All the land was taken by force. The entirety of the US was once Native land and now all they have are a few reservations that is mostly sparse land in which nothing grows. Even still the US has tried recently to take that as well for oil/gas pipelines and resources.
1698 2018-08-06 20:54:43 oil/water, sister/daughter
1699 2018-08-06 20:54:35 Then he should be grounded from the temple that is your body until he shapes up and gives you atleast ONE dinner  and technically you CAN do an oil change; all ya gotta do is take your car to Walmart and because YOU took it to get done, you get credit 
1700 2018-08-06 20:54:33 The Saudis have cut off all trade with us. So this would mean oil too I assume.
1701 2018-08-06 20:54:31 @BluewaterPower power out in Oil Springs, yet again.

1710 2018-08-06 20:53:55 Good interactive chart.   Unemployment went up under Notley but is trending down - oil prices are of course the great variable.    Would love to see private versus public sector job creation breakouts on those  stats.   Or is it available and I missed it... couldn’t find it ...
1711 2018-08-06 20:53:51 BTW- Was it .other Nature who diverted the H20 from the Colorado River to LA?! NOOO0- THAT was a manmade thing! 1st Law- NEVER take what you don't put back correctly,(is taking oil from the ground & putting it in the 02 as a danger to EVERYTHING is NOT correct!)
1712 2018-08-06 20:53:42 I’d say try the coconut oil and I’ve seen this type of thing on a dog before so just try to keep the wound clean and it’ll heal in time it’ll be okay
1713 2018-08-06 20:53:38 Piers you refused to talk about the herdsmen killing in Nigeria,also what your Country colluding with Nigeria government in killing innocent Biafrans because of oil,have you even asked where is Nnamdi Kanu British citizen,that makes you a scambag as well.
1714 2018-08-06 20:53:36 and then standard oil drops their prices massively to bankrupt their competition and buy them out. in the case of tech corporations, no one bothers with alternative services in the first place. trust-busting is the answer.
1715 2018-08-06 20:53:18 This is great. My personal favourite is the TRD oil filler cap. Nice touch.

Peanut butter, avocados, olive oil etc
1720 2018-08-06 20:52:13 Oil flowing is still not a solution. Honesty, good will & all inclusive debate without the bush divide of we are NRM you are opposition.
1721 2018-08-06 20:52:08 ffs so long.
1722 2018-08-06 20:52:08 That sounds good!!!  I wish just for once he would cook for me So I aint got to cook. He says just like you won't do an oil change I won't cook. Lol
1723 2018-08-06 20:52:04 On Nov. 4th the oil sanctions will hit the Mullahs very, very hard. Things will get even worse for them.
1724 2018-08-06 20:51:50 Canada only gets 9% of its oil from KSA.
1725 2018-08-06 20:51:42 olive oil really is magic

1727 2018-08-06 20:51:31 Well, it is true that Roosevelt's cutting off access to American oil lead to the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor.
1728 2018-08-06 20:51:26 I hope it works! It does for garlic oil. If the juice isn’t enough, you could peel the rind off of the lemon, mix it with some juice, sugar and a little cooking oil, then scrub your hands (gently) with that.

1731 2018-08-06 20:51:05 India is eager to trade with Central Asian countries, it has only 2 options: trade through Pakistan or via Iran. If India bows to US pressure and applies sanctions and stops buying Iranian oil, Iran should tell India to get on its bike and and not give it trade routes.

1737 2018-08-06 20:50:15 I had jasmine tea for the first time today. At first I liked it but then it got a bit overwhelming. I felt like I was drinking an essential oil. I also had more diet coke than I've been allowing myself lately, because I was out of the house so tap water wasn't available.
1738 2018-08-06 20:50:15 Pull the motor to fix an oil leak to figure out oil leak could be fixed without pulling? Haha

1743 2018-08-06 20:49:58 gonna be so funny when your country runs out of oil and the US backstabs you for all of the shit you guys got away with. 30 years before KSA turns into Iraq.
1744 2018-08-06 20:49:53 Yeah well I always found that a good oil makes a world of difference!  
1745 2018-08-06 20:49:33 I have done so many big boy things today.

1750 2018-08-06 20:49:08 The body was probably weak aluminium and cracked under pressure sending the oil everywhere and what ever was loose flew across the room. Can happen if it’s old/cheap materials!
1751 2018-08-06 20:49:06 Re the Highlands, do you mean the clearances or the ravages post Jacobite failure - or both? The McCrone report virtually states that excessive oil wealth would still have left West Coast - Glasgow etc. - wanting, so we're into whataboutery there.
1752 2018-08-06 20:48:53 They get 15% from canada and 30% from Saudi Arabia, everyone gets oil from the saudis, theyre basically untouchable, that’s why they have the high ground
1753 2018-08-06 20:48:25 So my 97' Civic is now leaking so much oil its leaving oil puddles everywhere. I think its the front and back main engine seals. Been advised if thats the case it wont be worth fixing. Time to start looking at car loans I guess :/
1754 2018-08-06 20:48:23 #Roadmap2019 please ask him who lead the governor to sue Gej so that they should share the oil money then?
1755 2018-08-06 20:48:20 I dont think he is being payed from the Gas and Oil industry.
1756 2018-08-06 20:48:18 Actually I think waffles have oil in the recipe where pancakes do not.
1757 2018-08-06 20:48:14 You can put any oil in an inhaler that you so choose to! However, we do not recommend putting multiple synergies in one inhaler as that is a lot of Essential oils being used at once.

1760 2018-08-06 20:48:07 Just about EVERY significant enterprise has been nationalized: banking, transportation, beverage, bakeries, mining, oil and gas, you name it. Oil and gas represents 95% of foreign income to gov't, which IS the economy  Yes, u are too stupid, or simply too lazy to do any research

1764 2018-08-06 20:47:33 Last time I did it was with oil paints and it was a disaster.  Acrylic is a lot easier and oddly very relaxing.  I had to stop myself from making too many stars because it was fun to do lol
1765 2018-08-06 20:47:24 Does Mexico have a choice? Where is the oil going to come from for the refineries he is going to build??
1766 2018-08-06 20:47:20 The Journalist being molested and beaten up. But still maximum media are not broadcasting proper news. Well let see how much oil they have and how long they do oiling.

1769 2018-08-06 20:46:54 CBD oil has been helping mine a lot! I also use natural calm (a magnesium supplement). I got that from Amazon and mix it with warm water at night. The best part is it helps me sleep!
1770 2018-08-06 20:46:45 Oil? Canada has an insane amount of oil. Last I checked the Us received roughly 30% of its oil from Canada.

1772 2018-08-06 20:46:38 You could put it with garlic, sea salt, and pepper, but you would have to cook it, or you can get some olive oil, white wine vinegar, sea salt, crushed red pepper  and a little italian seasoning. My fam at home makes this for our salads and it tastes pretty good.
1773 2018-08-06 20:46:35 He’s nothing more than a snake oil salesmen, good riddance
1774 2018-08-06 20:46:28 Better check the oil now
1775 2018-08-06 20:46:24 Apparently they don’t like mint oil? I don’t know if that’s true, but if it is one could try mint shower gel?

1778 2018-08-06 20:46:12 Sturgeon hasn’t demanded one...wonder why....oh yeah because people up here have wised up to her and her snake oil merchants.... must be why polling has been on the decline for Independence since it’s peak in 2014 eh! Numpty

1782 2018-08-06 20:45:58 #trudeau believes Canada does not need oil. If he cuts Canadians off from oil & gas the rest of the world will follow his divine leadership & the world will reach utopia. 
1783 2018-08-06 20:45:46 We Canadians live in a socialist regime. Delight in strangulation of hard risk and intitiative. See no pipelines. No oil to our own eastern region.  Lied outright to middle class. Hard workers abused.  JT rich family will go pay route for health care, kid education. Disgusting
1784 2018-08-06 20:45:45 I'm sure that as a yank you'll have heard of oil. You might also know of Scotch and Scottish food products. The pound will be used if we wish, its not England's place to say no. There are no subsidies. Come back when you actually learn something.
1785 2018-08-06 20:45:32 "Yep Yep! Tent, sleeping bags, blankets, cooking oil, non perishable food items, beverages, chairs, and bags!"

She spewed that out like nothing. The one upside to not filtering what she's thinking
1786 2018-08-06 20:45:21 Makes absolutely no sense why we buy oil from anyone
1787 2018-08-06 20:45:06 Our team excels at regular tune-ups, but we also offer a wide variety of other repair services, including brake service, oil and filter changes, and shock replacement.
1788 2018-08-06 20:45:06 #SaudiArabia angry because  #Canada has the guts to stand up for human rights. You'll note that it wasn't the #landofthefree (sic). Oil will run out and then so will your friends. The scales will miraculously fall from their eyes and they will see you for what you are.

1791 2018-08-06 20:44:41 Crisco or the stuff they use to make soybean oil candle wax would probably work too. #MyCommodityPriceSucksWorseThanYours
1792 2018-08-06 20:44:36 What is a "door closer"? Sounds like an oil pipeline which somehow had a pressure issue..
1793 2018-08-06 20:44:17 A lavender essential oil (from Now essential oils) and a diffuser necklace of your choice is the best.  It's beautiful, smells great and lasts forever! 1000% recomend 
1794 2018-08-06 20:44:16 Based oil these comments, you've never watched Maddison in your life. When you do, you'll feel like you've made a hash of this thread. Big time.
1795 2018-08-06 20:44:15 One of the differences is we may have an Energy East Pipeline started and never have to rely on Saudi imports of oil out East. Another is Harper never got us into these kinds of situations. Covering up for incompetence is not a good posture.
1796 2018-08-06 20:44:10 Here's what the Saudis have: A) Mecca, and B) A finite supply of a toxin that is killing the planet. For now, oil money buys power & influence. But soon the demand for oil will end, and with it, all that which it has enabled.

1809 2018-08-06 20:42:11 Seriously? You got pictures of The Secretary of State with Middle Eastern Men & that makes her the founder of Isis?
omg 
The Republicans started a war that killed thousands of Americans, invading a country to get their oil & destroyed many cities, it was her job to be there.
1810 2018-08-06 20:41:55 Honey........OPEC and the Saudis specifically are who lead to the price of oil tanking so hard in late 2014. They were doing all they could to crush an energy independent Iran
1811 2018-08-06 20:41:54 To those who thinks it's immoral to loot inferior "civilizations," Saudi Arabia is what happens when you don't. Take the oil.

1839 2018-08-06 20:37:30 This oil I got in my hair smells like spicy peppermint
1840 2018-08-06 20:37:28 Also great sliced/grilled with bell peppers, mushrooms, & whatever else you like (spray w/ olive oil, sprinkle w/ salt & pepper & any other seasoning you like - grill in grill basket ~20 min over M heat, stirring every 5 min or so). Serve with grilled  or . 
1841 2018-08-06 20:37:23 It may come to that - just need to play some forest/bird sound effects and sniff some pine essential oil. As writers we're good at using our imagination, I guess!
1842 2018-08-06 20:37:21 Education has nothing to do with it. Evangelicals believe god will intervene, or they will be raptured. Those in oil don’t care because their continued wealth and power during their lifetime is more important than anyone’s children. They don’t care what happens after they die.
1843 2018-08-06 20:37:18 Yeh You know what really really annoys me there is absolutely heaps of oil of the west coast of Scotland. I am an engineering doing Earth sciences at uni also the only reason we haven't tapped into it is simple the brit Government put a block on it as they wanted Nuke subs there
1844 2018-08-06 20:36:27 Alex Jones is probably happy he is getting the free publicity and the “look at how the MSM is censoring us” is making his followers buy his BS even more. He sells a bunch of snake oil to people too in their online store. Scaring ppl is making him rich.
1845 2018-08-06 20:36:20 Wonder if oil price has anything to do with it?
1846 2018-08-06 20:36:16 @Laura88Lee saying “aawwll” instead of oil is cracking me up. Also, shelter pets are the best! #AdoptDontShop
1847 2018-08-06 20:36:07 We don't need your oil.  Keep it.  Why do your students want to come here?  To get away from oppression and experience freedom, especially the women. You're effectively blocked.

Has anyone heard of this happening before, or know what might cause this?
1850 2018-08-06 20:35:56 My TWENTY SIX year old roommate told me today that her change oil light came on in her car and she had to ask her dad if it was okay If she drove around like that until payday on Thursday.

1851 2018-08-06 20:35:56 Also, being in the substance abuse and mental health field for over ten years, very rarely was there opioid AND cocaine use by the abusers. That’s why I question your “correlation” map. Obv, there’s exceptions, but the convo at hand and ur map are oil and water
1852 2018-08-06 20:35:51 When the cost of oil etc goes up: "Sorry, price increase immediately."
When the cost goes down: *crickets* "Renewal time, price is going up lots!"
Almost like it's some profiteering scam when run by private "competing" companies. 
1853 2018-08-06 20:35:50 It does wonders for dark spots & I swear it sucks up excess oil.
1854 2018-08-06 20:35:50 Allow me to curb your doubt. Trump is a treasonous liar who sold his snake oil to a large enough number of people to win the election, then installed the same people who blew out the economy to his cabinet and sold a tax break for his rich friends as a gift to snake oil owners.
1855 2018-08-06 20:35:49 Euro oil :)
1856 2018-08-06 20:35:46 There was a large scale oil exploration going on from Bahrain side, in Bahraini territorial waters toward Iran. No Americans involved. Work is being done by Bahraini locals. No exploration from Iran. probably this news is a fake. Pakistan should distance itself from Ameruicans.
1857 2018-08-06 20:35:44 Can we stop importing their oil now, please?
1858 2018-08-06 20:35:38 I'm not an expert on Venezuela (though I disagree with the U.S. supporting coup's of democratically elected leaders). One mistake I think they made was a top-down system of governance. I support distributed power. Plus an over reliance on *oil money* to fund wealth distribution.
1859 2018-08-06 20:35:24 Of course I need another oil change 
1860 2018-08-06 20:35:05 Who says they are fracking? It is for oil and will prob use acidisation instead. Further benzene and toluene are not permitted for fracking in UK. As for fish in the aquifers

1864 2018-08-06 20:34:47 When you can buy one without leaving home that comes in a box to your front door, does seem redundant. I remember the acquisition and thought this at the time.
1865 2018-08-06 20:34:39 Saudi Arabia’s involvement in 9/11 has been known for some time.  But for some odd reason, our government ignores it. If you control money and oil, you can do anything to the U.S. and get away with it.

This was their response.

End our ties with Saudi oil.
1909 2018-08-06 20:30:48 There is about 100 years of oil left. At least what we know of. There are many more undiscovered areas in which there are expected finds.
1910 2018-08-06 20:30:36 In the context of funding for new oil and gas projects, local banks with high NPLs from the sector are unwilling to lend them, hence the recourse to insurance

1914 2018-08-06 20:30:19 Gilded Door Oil and Vinegar Tap Room celebrated its grand opening yesterday and had a fantastic turnout!

1920 2018-08-06 20:29:52 But you were more than happy to kill energy East in favour of purchasing Saudi oil, what’s happened Dear?
1921 2018-08-06 20:29:45 In the Western world yes. But they're Sunni Muslim equivalent to the Vatican, if the Vatican was sitting on a sea of oil.
1922 2018-08-06 20:29:39 Pollution is bad enough even with these standards, can't imagine without them.  This just goes to show how far this administration has sold itself out to big corporations like oil companies.
1923 2018-08-06 20:29:38 Break the FAANGS Up...
Ever hear of Standard Oil...Ma Bell
1924 2018-08-06 20:29:37 Sure! Even engine oil self!

1926 2018-08-06 20:29:20 You will do nothing, because you're a tin pot state, totally dependant on the rest of the world, for everything. A virtual desert, propped up by oil, of which we are in no short supply.

1933 2018-08-06 20:28:33 can I get a beard oil that doesn't smell like I just ate treebeard's ass
1934 2018-08-06 20:28:33 In the directions we recommend 5-15 drops on the wick inside the inhaler. You just put the drops on the wick and close the lid and inhale the oil to get the benefits you are looking for.
1935 2018-08-06 20:28:22 i dont even care that it took 2 hours. i life down the street. i couldve gone the fuck home instead of that lobby for 2 hours. for some oil
1936 2018-08-06 20:28:21 ...and how much oil did you use to go collect this ocean plastic?
1937 2018-08-06 20:28:20 The crisis in Venezuela is rooted in a lot of factors: Corruption, drop in oil prices, US blocking financial transactions to ease debt, economic warfare waged by upper classes, Maduro not being as good at diplomacy as Chavez, violence on both sides.

It's a complex crisis.
1938 2018-08-06 20:28:19 Brent crude rose by US54 cents or 0.7% to US$73.75 a barrel and the US Nymex rose by US52 cents or 0.8% to US$69.01 a barrel.

1939 2018-08-06 20:28:14 Pulling strings everywhere. Out of the blue our new govt decided to stop oil and gas exploration. Doesn't take much to figure out who. It's getting old.
1940 2018-08-06 20:28:13 I’m in line to get my oil changed and the couple in the truck behind me is so cute and in love. Like wow. Gimme a love like that
1941 2018-08-06 20:28:05 Yh something about amniotic fluid having an odour that the palm oil dissolves... I think it’s quite cool there’s a reason behind seemingly weird things
1942 2018-08-06 20:27:56 Pretty obvious. Iran will turn to Trump's buddies in Russia and China and supply them with oil for military equipment and everyday supplies. Part of the Helsinki Agreement.
1943 2018-08-06 20:27:51 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1944 2018-08-06 20:27:50 Sorry but, i’m a italian male i love italian food italian are one of the most long-lived peoples after the Japanese. Italian food includes milk, meat , olive oil , a lot of kind of cheese, wine and a lot of vegetables so you can’t force me to became vegan ok?
1945 2018-08-06 20:27:50 “Cuz you was bout get ah Baby oil azz whipping” it’s on repeat and I’m n my office in tears 
1946 2018-08-06 20:27:47 The way some Ladies are attracted to cars ehn!, you will even think they were breastfed with engine oil
1947 2018-08-06 20:27:37 Pakistan tilt towards Saudi is quite restrictive for Pakistan. dependent on oil credit facility + Pakistani diaspora (remittances) coupled with aggressive Saudi behaviour, I doubt we will see any major upgrade in relations with Iran.
1948 2018-08-06 20:27:28 Looks very similar to my mother in law's Spanish prawns minus the Harrissa... Simplicity is best... Garlic, oil and parsley... I love them when we go home to Northern Spain... Like yours they are finger licking delicious

1953 2018-08-06 20:26:57 As an indian i know iran is strategic to us but once thz mullahs n maulvis need a proper lesson to be taught.India should reduce oil trade.
1954 2018-08-06 20:26:43 Vape pen or the oil?
1955 2018-08-06 20:26:38 Some of what you say is  true, although Blair's Labour could also be convicted of buying into bankers' snake oil. But not only is it overstated (on taxes, eg, what about Ireland, Lux and NL), if you REALLY believe it all, how were u ever a Tory? What drove the Damascene mo?
1956 2018-08-06 20:26:36 "how we exercise free speech?" You meant "how we peddle conspiracy theories and sell snake oil to gullible idiots.
1957 2018-08-06 20:26:35 You’ll look albino next to me when i get on the oil on wednesday
1958 2018-08-06 20:26:26 Snake oil salesman calling Pope Francis wrong.
1959 2018-08-06 20:26:24 Future wars will not be about oil. It will be water rights.

1961 2018-08-06 20:26:15 Need sum sweet oil
1962 2018-08-06 20:26:13 Ouch. Sounds like one of my previous vehicles, dubbed "The Stealth Lemon". An oil change would usually find enough else wrong to put it up to three figures, every time.
1963 2018-08-06 20:26:11 Do we have to use EVIL Alberta oil?
1964 2018-08-06 20:26:03 Will you have enough guts to cancel all oil shipments from Saudi Arabia?  We have lots of our own, in case you didn't know. Oh, sorry!  I forgot.  You killed Energy East.
1965 2018-08-06 20:25:59 It is so sad that Canada stands as the only Western Nation calling out Saudi Arabia on human rights abuse while others pamper to the country cos of their oil.
1966 2018-08-06 20:25:57 IMO if there was a wish list of Putin, clear #1 would be raising oil price, on #2 removing sanctions, then #3 destabilising NATO / EU and first then handing over Ukraine
1967 2018-08-06 20:25:42 I don’t mind topping oil up but blowing tyres up and filling washer bottles is a job the driver should be doing. Come spend a day with me and see how little spare time I have and you’d see what I mean 
1968 2018-08-06 20:25:40 No heat, no chemicals just hot oil treatment then straight backs

1973 2018-08-06 20:24:50 Major implications for the Middle East, oil through the Strait of Hormuz being one of them.  Another distraction from Trump, away from the Russia investigation.
1974 2018-08-06 20:24:26 Maybe Iran could redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol (with provisional application) in order to lift all nuclear-related economic sanctions, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets?
1975 2018-08-06 20:24:24 Yeah £60M for laporte, mendy £52M, stones £50M, walker £50M. Oil club at it's finest.
1976 2018-08-06 20:24:22 Was Tekno shouting in Pana?

1978 2018-08-06 20:24:18 If I break your heart na oil spillage
1979 2018-08-06 20:24:17 Guess u all will pay higher prices for oil bc KSA will cut off trade as well. Mind your own country's business.

1981 2018-08-06 20:23:59 Car shop always finding extra shit for me to pay for. Naw bruh, just give me my oil change so I can go. Lol.
1982 2018-08-06 20:23:47 Trudeau will bend for them, not just because he’s a pussy, which he is, but because he knows with the pipeline dispute we’re going to need that Saudi oil for a bit longer.
1983 2018-08-06 20:23:40 You do realize Ontario and Quebec get most of their oil from Saudi Arabia! Therefore it could potentially cripple the economy if they stop! So as a Canadian you should care! Not that I’m supporting the Saudis! But they hold allot of leverage at the moment!
1984 2018-08-06 20:23:39 I CALL BS!! This IS the INSANITY of an administration in the pocket of BIG OIL!! THIS MUST BE STOPPED!!
1985 2018-08-06 20:23:26 With the rate at which sardine is reducing inside the tin, I won't be shocked if I open the next tin and just see oil & a note with the words "Sardine was here" inside 
1986 2018-08-06 20:23:18 Today marks the 6th time my cars been hit while parked. This time at Toyota during an oil change. Nowhere and no one is safe. #whosnext
1987 2018-08-06 20:23:17 Maybe ask the oil companies to stop diverting and using precious water reserves for fracking!  But you wouldn’t do that to your rich billionaire friends would you?

1992 2018-08-06 20:22:36 Another reason to invest in Alberta oil for the short term and renewables for the long term, so these one horse countries can go the way of the dodo bird. #sciencetheshitoutofthis.
1993 2018-08-06 20:22:35 Literally spent over 4 hours in a dealership just for them to do my alignment & a oil change literally wtf
1994 2018-08-06 20:22:34 Ooooh I haven’t had it that way but that sounds like an interesting approach I bet it makes it nice and brown and crusty!!!!! Mayo is really just oil and egg yolk and vinegar anyways so whenever it’s used as like a “weird ingredient” (like in a cake) I’m never surprised anymore!
1995 2018-08-06 20:22:05 doTERRA is the world's most tested, most trusted essential oil company.

Because of our purity and testing standards, we know our oils are safe for all ages, and we offer a wonderful variety of support to your kiddos growing bodies.
1996 2018-08-06 20:21:45 Why does Ford have a plant in Russia? Is this what Donnie & Vlad talked about? Or was it about the sanctions on individual Russian businessmen close to Vlad? Right now oil & gas companies who haven't sold their interests are operating as usual.
1997 2018-08-06 20:21:44 Half the States on fire, 118 degree rain and of course, Donald Trump continues to spout his absolute ignorance about global warming being a hoax to help his buddies sell coal and crude oil. Completely worthless and totally corrupt.
1998 2018-08-06 20:21:36 The opposition of FLOW to reconstruction of the Line 5 Mackinac Straits crossing segment is completely irrational.  Such a project eliminates all risk of oil discharge at the Straits, means several hundred jobs for construction, maintains Line 5 needed Line 5 energy services.

2003 2018-08-06 20:21:22 heeeee that's so great! And you take such good care of you.

 My skin is adjusting and it's doing so by producing a lot of oil, I'm so dewy and shiny, but wow, the blotting is real.
2004 2018-08-06 20:21:13 BULLSHIT......... the White House wants to push the price of Oil up .....
Putin's instructions to his poodle .....increased oil prices will favour the Russian economy...
2005 2018-08-06 20:21:02 I can’t disagree with you that he is definitely some of those things, but none of that is illegal, nor is it causing physical or legitimate harm to anyone.  With the exception of Sandy Hook, which will be worked out in court.  He’s far from the only person selling snake oil.
2006 2018-08-06 20:21:02 It’s ridiculous that Richie Rich & frequent private helicopter traveler had a firmer understanding of the importance of the subway for all New Yorkers while Mayor Progressive bloviates about Climate Change and suing Big Oil while having no plans to reduce aggregate VMT.
2007 2018-08-06 20:21:01 A part of me would love to go special forces or try and the other part of me thinks it’s dumb to be in countries for only oil but claim they’re the terrorists
2008 2018-08-06 20:20:50 Baby oil or lotion is a good makeup remover.
2009 2018-08-06 20:20:44 When the recipe first called it an "aioli" I rolled my eyes. The fuck is an aioli?

I am an ignorant motherfucker because that shit is just egg and oil in a blender.

2014 2018-08-06 20:20:18 I feel sick but the hospital is too expensive so I’m just gonna drink a bottle of essential oil and call it a day
2015 2018-08-06 20:20:16 Looking forward to pumping E and doing an oil change after work
2016 2018-08-06 20:20:01 Long story short, new carburetor on the way. Stock OEM. I don't want to hot rod this engine yet. I need it to idle properly and run at factory rpms until I'm confident the valves aren't sticking, oil pressure is consistent, etc before I start bolting on upgrades.
2017 2018-08-06 20:19:49 The left magazine that everyone's constantly mad at has published a few. Basically, they say: (primarily) bad monetary policy, failure to diversify away from oil, corruption, and international sanctions.
2018 2018-08-06 20:19:48 Turkey used to be the heart of the Muslim world, it was an error by Britain to move the diplomatic clout away from Turkey to the Middle East. Saudi sells its oil to the West & buys our weapons for its wars: we have the whip hand over Saudi. Need to push for more reform is all.

2022 2018-08-06 20:19:34 Why in the hell are we importing oil to begin with we have the 3rd largest pool of oil in the world but don't tell that to Liberals who want to leave it in the ground and import instead
2023 2018-08-06 20:19:32 organic margarine is so damn tasty, it's that classic taste from the sunflower oil.
2024 2018-08-06 20:19:22 Don’t worry we can crush them down if we ban oil  they just hopeless and afraid of future, at the end their stupid GOV will apologize. They always did. 
2025 2018-08-06 20:19:13 everyine and their mom is getting their oil changed
2026 2018-08-06 20:19:12 Standard Oil only had a 70% market share when it was successful sued by the gov for monopolistic practices in violation of anti-trust law. What's FB's market share compared to Gab's?
2027 2018-08-06 20:19:04 9 billion recoverable and 227 billion  total are old #EIA estimate of shale oil in #Pakistan. The recent 100 billion barrel discovery by #Exxon is conventional #oil in #Balochistan near #Iran border

2032 2018-08-06 20:18:45 I once loved a girl, already lining her up as a potential wife, never touched her coz I’m not a fan of that normally & she even claimed she was a virgin which made it easier... 

Only for another man to be changing her engine oil monthly.

2035 2018-08-06 20:18:32 Whats the “miracle” ingredient? argan oil..? Argan oil is commonly used in cosmetics. 80% of its components are unsaturated fatty acids. Also containing traces of phenolics. So nothing fancy...dont expect to provide any “miracle”..

2047 2018-08-06 20:17:18 Is there nothing cheaper, like having a man, "man" one street, and another the next street. We have to cut the coat according the cloth...until oil flows maybe
2048 2018-08-06 20:17:18 I’ve heard differing reports with regards to police. It’s all over the board too. Lots to assess and dig thru. I suspect that investigation will be thorough and investigators will be burning midnight oil to wrap up in 14 days. 
2049 2018-08-06 20:17:14 Better than most countries true but its been on a decline from the past couple years and its like 70% of usd when it used to be so much higher. Hopefully canada can find a way to remedy all the loss of business of their oil riggs soon
2050 2018-08-06 20:17:12 So, which one of y'all cool tweeps know where I can buy some cape oil? If possible Deva
2051 2018-08-06 20:17:11 lol have you ever seen america, pal?  tell that to the banks, the farmers, oil companies, etc.

but in a way, I'm with you.  I see we nationalize everything.
2052 2018-08-06 20:16:59 You have to be a ritual killer in order to fry egg with palm oil
2053 2018-08-06 20:16:55 You should ban Saudi oil in response
2054 2018-08-06 20:16:48 To make even a hint of an attack against another nation's citizens should have every nation condemning the Saudis. Time to destroy opec and trade with responsible oil producing countries.

2057 2018-08-06 20:16:36 Guess where Iran gets most of its foreign currency from? Oil

Notice which export is missing from the list

But closing the US market to the Iranian automotive sector will surely break the will of the Iranian government

tRump's "tough talk" is, again, all bluster and BS

2058 2018-08-06 20:16:21 Ha my sons have no idea. Lots of brains in my family not much oil or brawn 
2059 2018-08-06 20:16:03 @madflavor @leesyatt A buddy makes me a full plant CBD and THC oil. I take a whole dropper a few times a day. It helps with the pain. 
2060 2018-08-06 20:15:58 I’m out of anointing oil 
2061 2018-08-06 20:15:47 Maybe with recent actions by Saudi Arabia its time Canada stopped importing their oil. @cafreeland @OilGasCanada @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer
2062 2018-08-06 20:15:45 Ethan, Great question re: energy. We found partial data on total oil & gas lease acreage --at least 150 million acres. But as most of this 150 million figure was "dual-purpose" and exploratory  (not necessarily producing) we decided to leave for a future map.
2063 2018-08-06 20:15:45 I wish we would stop buying any Middle East oil and only have a relationship with Israel. Any money we send to any other Middle East country is a waste.
2064 2018-08-06 20:15:44 I can smell the coconut oil 
2065 2018-08-06 20:15:39 @Botanygeek Hi James. Do you have any knowledge of Copaiba Oil? Claims of pain relief and much more. My bro in law looking to help dad who's experiencing pain due to nerve damage after chemo. I am skeptical. 
2066 2018-08-06 20:15:37 The project i got posted to was the new underpass at dangi
2067 2018-08-06 20:15:18 S/O @thisisherv on the beard oil Clutch
2068 2018-08-06 20:15:11 Surely some mistake. I reckon that plane was Russian. Or perhaps Iraqi. Or Iranian. Our friends in Saudi Arabia are too busy pumping our oil to get up to anything nefarious
2069 2018-08-06 20:15:04 Coconut oil works well on damp skin like after a shower. Midday moisture I use avocado oil or morrocan oil when needed.  Since coconut oil is in my body wash, I don't moisturize midday too often unless there's really dry heat.
2070 2018-08-06 20:15:02 wow I have learned that auto-tune was developed by the oil industry & I'm fucked now
2071 2018-08-06 20:14:53 Saudi's are no longer well healed. They need funds badly, lot of their projects stalled and oil future in general not very bright, since their biggest buyer US is now itself an exporter. 
SalmanWahabiEnforcer!!!
2072 2018-08-06 20:14:46 Danny O'Connor is going to show the people of Ohio that an election cannot be bought or facilitated by a president who fails to do his homework and doesn't even know who is running, a man who attends rallies and does nothing but sell his own brand of snake oil. God bless us all.
2073 2018-08-06 20:14:43 Never give up! You have to start prepping your skin for it as it starts coming in. Beard oil works wonders (even at your stage) and I wouldn't be against some conditioner in it. I have a massive beard so you have to believe me.
2074 2018-08-06 20:14:41 Diversity with oil is our strength.  We want lots of filthy Saudi oil shipped by mega tankers followed by dangerous trains.
2075 2018-08-06 20:14:35 The moment Saudi Arabia stops being convenient for the West (ie cheap oil), it’ll regress further into the complete shithole waste of a landmass filled with human rights violations that it already is. 

Be better before you complain about our practices.
2076 2018-08-06 20:14:34 Translation: inside our borders we can imprison and behead human rights activists. Look the other way. No we won’t. We will expose you for the terrorist, archaic and  barbarian little country that you are. Without oil you are nothing.

うちも前回ギリギリだったので人のこと言えないですけど、
そういう遅延は困るどころじゃないのでやめて欲しいですね…。
今回気象がヤバかったので住んでる場所によっては大変でしたでしょうけど。
2081 2018-08-06 20:13:49 But yeah it's a very common practice and modern discoveries about the benefits of palm oil
2082 2018-08-06 20:13:35 Does oil and vinegar on a sub really be hitting? I’m tryna find out
2083 2018-08-06 20:13:34 Now these minorities , are they brown or ginger , asking for some barnett parasite Scots with oil here.
2084 2018-08-06 20:13:32 Haven’t been high or felt this relaxed in about 5 years.. definitely missed this relaxed feeling. Am pretty thankful for cbd oil right now. 
2085 2018-08-06 20:13:09 Canada- sever all ties to these buggers and boycott Saudi oil!
2086 2018-08-06 20:13:07 Oh yeah we know that  your monarchy bribed the shit of you but sorry that oil money will run dry eventually.
2087 2018-08-06 20:12:57 That proletariat nonsense was marketing and spin for a USSR that didn't care about worker safety or human rights. The USSR was an oil and weapons corporation masquerading as a government. They didn't practice a lot of actual socialism at all.
2088 2018-08-06 20:12:53 When your @Nissan dealership says they rotated the tires on your 2017 car, but the chalk marks we put on the tires say otherwise.  Not to mention the attempt to charge $300 for 15k oil change. Crooks. Truly the worst dealership on the PLANET.
2089 2018-08-06 20:12:30 Give it more time. Some ppl take months for a decent beard. As for the itch, get yourself some beard balm (not oil). It’s used when growing a beard and soothes the itch. I recommend Proasso-Italian co. that’s been around forever. Good quality, price & smell. Shopper’s Drug Mart
2090 2018-08-06 20:12:16 Didn't know that! I use castor oil for inflamation (=pain) and fertility. It worked both with me! 
2091 2018-08-06 20:12:15 無事に帰れたかどうかは誰にもわからなかった...
2092 2018-08-06 20:12:05 Yup...lots of countries are buying oil from those two and after directly funding them ask for help to defend against them from NATO.
2093 2018-08-06 20:12:01 also I think about you whenever anyone brings up truffles, including truffle oil
2094 2018-08-06 20:11:59 This is what I tell ppl when they cry about Twitter shadow-banning them, etc. it’s free software. If they don’t like it, they can go somewhere else. Then these “small government” politicians want to control what the tech companies do. But not oil or financial companies.
2095 2018-08-06 20:11:51 I would have hoped instead that she was there to stage a one-woman demonstration against Arctic oil exploration. But she's just another Putin lackey. The Greens should fire that fraud and get a real climate warrior to lead them.
2096 2018-08-06 20:11:35 People really have a hard time delineating an actual free speech issue, where a civic authority is involved, from private entities deciding supporting a snake oil pedaling conspiracy theorist is not in the interest of their service.
2097 2018-08-06 20:11:28 Washes of thin haze from the rush of mechanical hay-baling in every field, under cloud-dotted blue evening sky, are making every Cambridgeshire view look like an oil painting.
2098 2018-08-06 20:11:23 @NicolasMaduro Rich in oil, poor in leadership.  Your country could be great. Dump Socialism! God can bless you and your country - just ask!
2099 2018-08-06 20:11:23 I'm  trying to picture Adam Smith on an Alex Jones-style rant about rent or the danger of regulations proposed by the merchant class.

Nope. Not woking. Jones is a peddle of snake oil and hate.
2100 2018-08-06 20:11:16 Sounds like it's a result of the complex regulations no one person could possibly understand, that you helped to pass.
2101 2018-08-06 20:11:02 It's so cold in this office, the coconut oil on my skin turned back into a solid.
2102 2018-08-06 20:11:01 I despise his oil politics, so matter how many Prides he attends to.
2103 2018-08-06 20:10:58 The fund is small now ($5B). AK has $60B in theirs. But even if there were no more oil taxes to put in the fund, if we distributed some and reinvested some it would grow forever - for the people now and for future generations as well.
2104 2018-08-06 20:10:49 Iv noticed quite a bit of palm oil from the duchess bridge heading to the mouth, does this stuff need reporting ?
2105 2018-08-06 20:10:40 Working so hard today since 8am to edit SO MANY new videos I will be releasing to @ManyVids this week. Get ready for submissive dirty talk, oil rub on tits, deepthroat drool gag/choke show, anal probe, triple penetration (DP while deepthroating), nipple pinch/suck + mirror fuck!

2108 2018-08-06 20:10:34 • apply ice cubes to your temples

2110 2018-08-06 20:10:31 Well I dropped my car off at 830 this morning to get an oil change and it’s still not ready... like wut
2111 2018-08-06 20:10:27 Omg I need to put some oil in my hair it is itching 
2112 2018-08-06 20:10:23 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
2113 2018-08-06 20:10:10 It seems the money the oil companies are spending on climate hoax propaganda is being well spent.

2115 2018-08-06 20:09:43 lol dude.... flush your engine......wth...with what??? Only thing that needs to go into your engine is OIL, thats it. Water goes in as well but would never be "dirty" enough to be called "gunk". Did they ask you to flush your transmission? If so, NEVER do that.
2116 2018-08-06 20:09:34 Big oil companies own Justin
2117 2018-08-06 20:09:32 Freedom they chose to butcher humanity at cost of lives of millions of innocent children. They are sick for money, money, fkin money. They do anything for money, holyshit devils ruling this world, they chose USA ever since puppet for gold, oil, drugs!Kennedy warned, he was killed
2118 2018-08-06 20:09:27 ....if you don’t buy your own toothpaste, or cooking oil, your too young for me
2119 2018-08-06 20:09:26 Either way, my original point was that as long as the drinks (read: oil) keep flowing, the Saudis will party it up, and there's not much the world can do about it.
2120 2018-08-06 20:09:18 Мне понравилось видео "Skull Study Oil Painting in Moleskine Sketchbook | Making mediums accessible"
2121 2018-08-06 20:09:02 I would support the idea but it is of course an absurdly empty promise. Once the oil gets to the refinery they are not keeping track of what gasoline it becomes.

I'm also certain Scheer's oil company backers (the ones that buy and trade "terror oil") would also oppose this.
2122 2018-08-06 20:08:44 Dear god a bunch of coconut oil in my hair and now I'm just trying to keep my emotions in check on it and we have it some food and water.
2123 2018-08-06 20:08:43 الله يحفظ السعوديه وحجاج بيت الله الحرام لهم معاملة خاصه .. ولا تدخل في شؤننا
2124 2018-08-06 20:08:43 Oh and of course cut up some tomatoes and throw that in it too. Drizzle it with fresh olive oil, throw some fresh garden basil on it and use some fresh (dry) Italian seasonings. Anything else I forgot? 
2125 2018-08-06 20:08:43 If there's anyway i can use coconut oil on my hair for more than a day would be great...i love how it makes my hair shine, soft, frizz free and define my wave without weighing it down...the only probs is the smell after a few hours...
2126 2018-08-06 20:08:38 Useful idiots the left doesnt even want to claim.
2127 2018-08-06 20:08:35 @MSNBC @Morning_Joe I'd like to see Joe go to the Gulf,  and tell the shrimpers and fishermen, restaurants,  small business owners,  "The Gulf Oil Spill went away."

2128 2018-08-06 20:08:35 China and Europe refused USA sanctions so oil prices will down to 56-60$ very soon
2129 2018-08-06 20:08:34 According to my friend:
The shop in dekweneh closed 2 years ago 

But there is one that sells korean raw ingredients like sesame oil seaweed and kimchi

A Mr. Park supplies them and places them at "Rita's Health Food Store" 
It's located on the street parallel to aubmc hamra
2130 2018-08-06 20:08:28 Looks like most of Canada's imported oil comes from countries with few, if any, environmental controls & terrible human rights records. Leftists prefer this to Canadian oil because...........?
2131 2018-08-06 20:08:25 People like him are why I had to do so much research to lose my weight. They sell doubt, just like the tobacco companies did. Worse than snake oil salesmen.

2134 2018-08-06 20:08:10 The same ones that fry plantain with palm oil
2135 2018-08-06 20:07:53 That's stereotypical thinking. Aside from this oil thing you r mentioning like it's a controlled substance!, Saudi Arabia is the heart of Arab land and culture in addition to the holy lands where Ibrahim and Ismeal as well as Mohammed were ... visiting or not is ur choice 
2136 2018-08-06 20:07:44 No, like who fries eggs with palm oil
2137 2018-08-06 20:07:38 Using coconut oil as an oil clenser has transformed my skin texture and completely reduced the size of my pores.
2138 2018-08-06 20:07:38 So much talk going on now about greatness of socialism. It is so great that it has never worked in any country. Average Venezuela Citizen lost 15 pounds last year for lack of food. They have larger oil and gas reserves Than the Saudis but can’t make money
2139 2018-08-06 20:07:17 Absolutely nothing of monetary or intellectual benefit. In a few decades when the oil money dries up, what then for this highly volatile region? (As an aside, check out the excellent Clooney-Damon movie "Syriana" on this very topic!).
2140 2018-08-06 20:07:07 we do not discuss Trump, we discuss KSA and silence of PM Trudeau.  Also it is Trudeau government who buys oil from Saudi Arabia having oil in Canada and does everything for Alberta oil to become uncompetitive.
2141 2018-08-06 20:06:52 Can someone lmk if the Sunday Riley UFO Clarifying Face Oil works? And if I need it??? Helpppp skin care junkiesss
2142 2018-08-06 20:06:32 That lemon pepper shit is garbage. It’s like straight oil that’s not a sauce. Bdub over the stop
2143 2018-08-06 20:06:30 We're trying to move away from using fossil fuels as weapons of shaming. I'd suggest vegetable oil, but I doubt the feathers would stick. Some sort of tree sap should work...
2144 2018-08-06 20:06:24 Prince controls on goods that forced private business to stop making them because the sale price didn't cover costs.

Expropriating foreign oil company assets, driving away private expertise necessary to keep the state oil company productive.

You know, capitalism.
2145 2018-08-06 20:06:23 apple, carrot,walnuts, raisins, 2 kinds of flour, coconut oil, brown sugar
2146 2018-08-06 20:06:21 I totally agree. We have enough of our own oil to supply 100% of our needs. We need to create our own refineries. I know it’s not PC but we can build state of the art and do it as clean as possible. Initially it would cost us, but buy backs from the US does that anyway
2147 2018-08-06 20:06:13 cannot overstate how great oil absorbing sheets are
2148 2018-08-06 20:06:07 I keep waiting for him to bring back whale oil, with his obvious love for endangered species and all...
2149 2018-08-06 20:06:04 I wish all tge world turn to clean and renewable energy , but you and I know it's something that will take a long time to be an everyday reality, meanwhile oil is the cheapest and accessible alternative and govt will always make sure they get a steady resources and don't run out.
2150 2018-08-06 20:06:03 Sis, it really is. Mix it with some Vitamin E or Avocado oil and bihhhh
2151 2018-08-06 20:05:57 The best part about getting my oil changed is when they refill my wiper fluid hehe
2152 2018-08-06 20:05:53 Literal Klansmen as cops, slavery, lynchings, Jim Crow, treatment of native Americans past and present, endorsement of Saudi Arabia past and present, oil wars, corporate warfare restoring he environment, third world conditions in states, rampant poverty, poor education
2153 2018-08-06 20:05:43 They also have Eucalyptus trees, which contain a highly flamable oil that can ignite on it's own in hot dry conditions.  Noone seems to notice that detail.

2161 2018-08-06 20:05:12 How to get that "Money Glow"

- Bath in and apply coconut oil. (It helps moisturise skin, keeping it healthy.)
- Drink lots of water, the more amount of energy you spend the more water you need. 
- Drink green tea, helps detox and flush out toxins that might be bad for the skin.

2165 2018-08-06 20:04:43 Waterboarding, but with truffle oil
2166 2018-08-06 20:04:41 Lol we will share the oil I’m planning to get 
2167 2018-08-06 20:04:33 Nope. Saudi oil is a mere 2% of Canadian import volume. Easily replaced. Other expirt trade sectors amount to little as well (arms). 

Exports to US from Canada booming despite tariffs and to the chagrin of Trump no doubt.
2168 2018-08-06 20:04:32 ゲェーッ！？
2169 2018-08-06 20:04:18 Fogwill (from interview): "Most US oil come from the Bakken. It's light oil and it's easy and cheap to refine compared to Canadian crude. In all of our scenarios, that crude coming from the United States going into Ontario didn't change."

2171 2018-08-06 20:04:12 I won't be surprised if the excess supply of furnace oil strikes again, unless all these rudimentary & old refineries continue to operate at lower utilisation rate in perpetuity.
2172 2018-08-06 20:04:11 Cocktails Heid?
2173 2018-08-06 20:04:06 Hopefully they cut off the oil to eastern Canada cuz we have pipelines,,,,,wait,,,
2174 2018-08-06 20:04:05 Everyone that complains about oil production, shipping, etc, should be forced to live with any petroleum products.  What an eye opener that would be for them!
2175 2018-08-06 20:04:05 Good stay home and shove your oil where the sun don't shine.
2176 2018-08-06 20:04:02 Mark, this one I am going to give you a bigger piece of the puzzle: Iran sells oil in euros.  Big no-no in a petro dollar based economic world.
2177 2018-08-06 20:03:45 This deep state attack on sausage headed character assassins who sell snake oil nutrition supplements must not stand.

2181 2018-08-06 20:03:26 I may have overthought this one haha. I was researching how Saturn was worshipped in Roman times, and in his cult the statue was veiled, filled with oil and feet bound with oil. My guy is scared of death, so he treats his clock in a same way hoping he'll be granted more time. 
2182 2018-08-06 20:03:18 I have been saying this same thing since the snake oil salesman ragged the press last week. He was extra horrible last week. Boycott the POS and stop giving him air time. He needs to b taught a lesson. Believe you me he is watching all news stations not just propaganda fox.
2183 2018-08-06 20:02:56 I also gotta get an oil change and I bought a 5gal so I can retire my 2.5gal my paycheck is Gone
2184 2018-08-06 20:02:40 Actually you can. That’s how they put out the oil fires in Iraq.
2185 2018-08-06 20:02:40 Try to get like eucalyptus oil or tea tree oil and like mix it with coconut or olive oil and put it on to feel more relaxed 
2186 2018-08-06 20:02:39 Bullshit!
Everything is related to their oil & oil price control by USA!
2187 2018-08-06 20:02:38 if you think there are subsidies to oil/gas, some of those countries have insane subsidies. politics/poverty it would be really hard to have good EV incentives (because how can you justify subsidy for rich peoples cars). EM EV sales will take time

2189 2018-08-06 20:02:26 @marcuslemonis commercial U said don't bring up my business. Camping world 3 encounters all negative. Was in NY needed oil change I had parts 5 hours excuse had to get parts. Wauconda Ill, Mailer sales sign on door store closed on Sunday's every item looking for could not b found
2190 2018-08-06 20:02:24 what a day oil check . travel down road and see smoke.. I didn't think much  about it until I saw oil spill. thought carb . but was a loose oil cap. But OMG  @rihanna always when in a hurry
2191 2018-08-06 20:02:24 Stop importing any oil into Canada and Energy East becomes a viable option?
2192 2018-08-06 20:02:15 Friends? Wait till the oil dries/is no longer needed.....
2193 2018-08-06 20:02:14 Trudeau owns a pipeline - KinderMorgan - too bad it moves oil to the West, instead of the East.  Welcome to Trudeau's energy policy - piss off the Saudis and end up begging Trump for oil/gas.  Do you think Trump will bail us out?  Too funny.
2194 2018-08-06 20:02:14 Interesting idea. I personally like coconut oil, lemon juice and honey.
2195 2018-08-06 20:02:13 Saudi Arabia chose the wrong country to mess with. If they were afraid of one blogger, I'm sure they will enjoy the sht show they just created w Canada. Words & silent majority are more dangerous than bombs nowadays. Careful princes: oil and money doesn't follow to the afterworld
2196 2018-08-06 20:02:07 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
2197 2018-08-06 20:02:03 Energy east always was, in my opinion, the best project for Canada. Canadian oil to a Canadian refinery for export and domestic use. What a no brainer, but... Quebec.
2198 2018-08-06 20:01:50 As result Russia is biggest importer on Earth of Palm oil (which not edible basically, it's still hard at 39 C degree) because there's shortages of cows = so shortages of milk = it's impossible to make cheap russian natural cheese. #Putin's EU blockade resulted in food surrogates
2199 2018-08-06 20:01:48 Pray for a close friend who believes in snake oil quick fixes 
2200 2018-08-06 20:01:48 More exactly UK produce OIL ( in Scotland ) but we ca easily find other providers. UK , at my opinion, was the last country that had material interest to leave UE , in fact UK has committed suicide it's sad. But as Friend what can we say excpet " Have a second look, thing again"
2201 2018-08-06 20:01:36 Peppermint oil and gum helped a lot. Didn’t make it 100% better but helped.
2202 2018-08-06 20:01:28 They don’t use oil !!
2203 2018-08-06 20:01:25 so apparently olive oil helps you tan faster... i currently feel like a marinated souvlaki
2204 2018-08-06 20:01:10 It is NOT! Not when one fandom is lashing out at the other one for some time now. Then it is called giving Oil to the Flame!
2205 2018-08-06 20:01:08 i picked up a shampoo and hot oil treatment and the ingredients lists are really “sulfate, alcohol, fragrance, [nice stuff], parabens” like people rly don’t read this

2213 2018-08-06 20:00:34 Too much oil put in & it sucked it into the cat. Car started smoking and lost power. Garage man said it may have to have engine stripped down. Then red engine light came on again and car was all juddery. It was only the coil and plugs though.

Banks, farmers, schools, pharma, steel, aluminum, gas, oil, auto, insurance, etc., etc., and etc. are all beneficiaries to government subsidies.  A bit hypocritical/ignorant to get bent re subsidies re 'local coverage'.

2228 2018-08-06 19:58:47 "Sadly it's not", what a cop out. I'll bet you campaign regularly for better public transport. Still  keep driving, keep screwing the environment, keep putting money into the big oil companies, a notably socialist enterprise.

2233 2018-08-06 19:58:25 We are on the right track with President Trump. We need to be independent with regard to energy, and trade items. Remember when the Oil Cartel realized that we were 100% dependent on them? They created a false shortage and raised prices through the ceiling.

2235 2018-08-06 19:57:48 I found it sucked up the (oil) paint, but I use refined turps so that might explain it…hang on…
2236 2018-08-06 19:57:32 Canada should be self-sufficient and not be importing any body's oil... 
2237 2018-08-06 19:57:30 Nono. Thats a myth by standard fat fearing science. Everyone knows soap emulsifies fat. To be sure your macros stay true beyond the plate you NEED MCT oil shots with your tidepod suppliments. Its part of the new #kleanketo protocol!!
2238 2018-08-06 19:57:28 Energy East was only going to bring oil to the coast to load onto tankers and ship overseas. None of it was going to be refined in Canada. Check the project - there's money to upgrade the port, none to upgrade the refinery (which can't refine oil sands crude).
2239 2018-08-06 19:57:28 Look, you don't threaten a thug with shaming. You remove yourself from all dealings with them. Canada should've weaned itself from the Saudi oil teat long ago. Don't do business with despicable tyrants! #cdnpoli
2240 2018-08-06 19:57:13 We have plenty of Oil & Petroleum. But we have demons that suck it dry and make profit out of Oppressing us

I remember Trump's words about Iraq; We should have taken all the oil, the oil was important, should have got all the oil....
Paraphrasing here, you get the gist!!

2259 2018-08-06 19:55:44 Canada doesn't buy oil. Private enterprise buys oil. And private enterprise exported 500% more oil from Canada than it imported making the entire point moot.

2320 2018-08-06 19:48:56 After Netanyahu got Trump to end the #IranDeal- Iran has been on the defensive. Trump’s sanctions on Iran take effect today. If Iran stops oil production there’s a chance of WW3.
I wonder if all those who voted for Trump and said “I don’t want to see WW3” realize the irony yet.
2321 2018-08-06 19:48:51 I ALREADY SLEEP IN COCONUT OIL
2322 2018-08-06 19:48:46 but not S/X. 3 and Y yes. also how utilities are handled in most EM is different, often times state owned. let's use mexico again as example gov owns oil and electric distribution. zero incentives to move to sustainable generation. in some other countries similar situations
2323 2018-08-06 19:48:43 Unfortunately I ordered some REALLY cheap plastic cartridges w wicks on accident and they burned the oil like, immediately (waiting for a glass wickless one in the mail) but I tasted a dab of oil on my tongue & it tastes/smells awesome
2324 2018-08-06 19:48:38 As I finish my second jar of olives in six days it occurs to me I could probably maintain my beer consumption and lose weight if I just went a little easier on those delicious green balls of salty oil.
2325 2018-08-06 19:48:35 I am curious about Exxon Mobil taking one off stake in an oil block JV, when they have no active upstream presence /operations in the country!

Why would they do that?
2326 2018-08-06 19:48:33 @trapo ay bro, ironically I need an oil change for my car.
2327 2018-08-06 19:48:26 Reminds me of how my grandfather until last year worked for a company that functionally created a machine that turns feces into oil. I do not recall if they got to patent for it, but the company i believe is defunct since the CEO screwed over tons of people in different nationa
2328 2018-08-06 19:48:18 Who will tell the world about all the frogs turning gay? Who will be there to take all the orders for the weight loss/muscle building snake oil......oh, there's the real reason
2329 2018-08-06 19:48:12 AND FOR THEIR NEXT TRICK...
THE SHRIMP WILL PERFORM THE DEATH DEFYING HIGH DIVE INTO A VAT OF BOILING OIL!!!
2330 2018-08-06 19:48:05 They are protecting the environment from our dirty oil...which is already in the ground by shipping raw sewage into the ocean. Real visionaries.
2331 2018-08-06 19:48:04 Well..This afternoon we already got a taste that probably oil will be soft this month. WTI fell almost USD 1 on nothing and the contango between the first and second contract started to be reduced.
2332 2018-08-06 19:47:58 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they do it doggy style
2333 2018-08-06 19:47:34 How can this country take the stand it does on Saudi human rights, (which is not incorrect) and yet still allow Saudi oil in to feed Quebec and Eastern Canada.
2334 2018-08-06 19:47:32 Of course. They get  from oil and gas companies.
2335 2018-08-06 19:47:26 i can't drink pepsi anymore bc when i was pregnant i mixed it w castor oil to induce labor and now that's all i taste 
2336 2018-08-06 19:47:24 So what would’ve happened to all that oil of no one every touched it? If it was never developed at all. I can tell you some things, but you won’t like it
2337 2018-08-06 19:47:22 Your knowledge exposing refining capacity based on foreign oil hints why US investment capacity remains limited as imports continue

Unfortunately US leaders continued subsidizing #fossilfuels impedes transition to #renewableenergy ignoring #market share / stranded assets issue
2338 2018-08-06 19:47:15 Is it just me or does the smell of sesame oil make you crave a salad?  lol
2339 2018-08-06 19:47:13 TIL that weird taste you can find deep down under the tangy citrus deliciousness of a glass of Sunny Delight is Pear and not motor oil. 

They simply happen to taste the same.
2340 2018-08-06 19:47:11 You won't be laughing when Iran blocks the Straight by sinking ships because that stops a quarter of the world oil supply. Iran could easily bomb Saudi's oil fields & thats your petrodollar down the tubes!
2341 2018-08-06 19:46:58 congrats Canada! there are more countries that produce oil!
2342 2018-08-06 19:46:53 Fuck Walmart! I’m doing my own oil change from now on. Independent af! 

But you know I’ll go once and while to make sure my filter and battery are in good condition lol 
2343 2018-08-06 19:46:50 Why does olive oil have to have so many calories god damn
2344 2018-08-06 19:46:25 I use coconut oil a lot for moisturizer, it works really well.
2345 2018-08-06 19:46:16 Giving a @FERC welcome today to regulators from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, here to discuss @FERC processes for certification and docketing. International meetings like this help foster collaboration on important market and regulatory matters.
2346 2018-08-06 19:46:10 If only eastern Canada could get our oil
2347 2018-08-06 19:45:44 Well it's a solid oil, nothing she needs to be eating.
2348 2018-08-06 19:45:39 There is bio oil as well :)
2349 2018-08-06 19:45:37 The Saudis. They’ve proven that. First Nations haven’t even been given the chance to fail. Or the oil under their land.
2350 2018-08-06 19:45:34 SO LAST NIGHT HULK INADVERTENTLY CREATED THE BEST SANDWICH EVER: PULLED CHICKEN LIGHTLY DRESSED IN RICE VINEGAR, OLIVE OIL, BUTTER, SALT,
2351 2018-08-06 19:45:24 I don’t know what y’all are thinking, Ngozi Iweala was a minister during the oil boom yet look at what she did, she messed up everything, Kemi came and met an empty treasury and still plunged us out of recession. She deserve some accolades.
2352 2018-08-06 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2353 2018-08-06 19:45:13 me googling "can i cook with linseed oil"
2354 2018-08-06 19:45:09 สนใจค่า
2355 2018-08-06 19:44:51 Rabbim şifalar ihsan eylesin.Uzak Doğudan(g.kore,Malezya,Endonezya) turna balığı karaciğeri yağı(tung liver oil) temin etmeye çalışın.kargoyla göndermiyolar.yemeklerine katarsanız çok iyi gelecektir.
2356 2018-08-06 19:44:25 Get a new car they said, it’ll be fun they said. Yeah until it’s damn near $60 for an oil change bc you need synthetic oil 
2357 2018-08-06 19:44:25 Just like the oil industry years ago
......
2358 2018-08-06 19:44:00 You can only eat tide pods if they dont drop you under your fat macros, best thing is chase them with a shot of mct oil
2359 2018-08-06 19:43:59 now if the Saudi's cut off oil supplies (though they have no problem with our money) there'll be a lot of Quebec regret over the opposition to Energy East!
2360 2018-08-06 19:43:58 Still, could even become worse easily...ending oil exports to HR pushing countries? For me it is time for a holiday soon....looking forward to a beach in Croatia where the only oil I am thinking of is the sun tan oil for my kids for two weeks.
2361 2018-08-06 19:43:51 Bruh @Scevex thought Aquafina was fucking oil I’m done with life
2362 2018-08-06 19:43:44 YEP im fine!! the oil got my hand once but it wasn't that bad haha
2363 2018-08-06 19:43:35 Remove the oil from Saudi Arabia & that 'nation' will descend into barbarism in a few months time. One of the most evil empires that has ever existed.

#goCanada
2364 2018-08-06 19:43:34 Stop buying Saudi Oil and stop arming them!
2365 2018-08-06 19:43:32 Where can I get CBD oil

2367 2018-08-06 19:43:15 I’ve had too much fun with mine this afternoon  filled half a bottle with oil, added lots of glitter and sequins, then added a bit of water and that’s it

2370 2018-08-06 19:42:54 Mert: only take a half a tea spoon of cannabis coconut oil 
Me: *takes one a half table spoons*
2371 2018-08-06 19:42:35 I bought solid coconut oil to use for scar massage after my surgery. My crazy cat Zoey thinks it is food and good and is fighting me trying to lick it out of the jar.
2372 2018-08-06 19:42:35 Honay wala ni kab ka hua w hai pr gndi naali ki siasat ki waja sy gas aur oil ni nikala ja raha
2373 2018-08-06 19:42:21 Kinda sad that it’s even an issue.  Where is cash supposed to come from for transfer payments? Quebec makes a killing, yet they want to strangle their free ride. AB oil and gas most highly regulated in world.. hey let’s buy less responsible oil from dictators and prop em up
2374 2018-08-06 19:42:19 Won't forget the day I used palm oil to fry egg 
2375 2018-08-06 19:42:02 It was even walmart generic cheddar cheese and I have the pack of 20 street tortlllas and cut two or 3 into fourths then fried them in veg and olive oil.
2376 2018-08-06 19:41:59 Me: “Hey dad how was your day?”
Dad: “...did you change the oil in your car?!”
2377 2018-08-06 19:41:48 I love perfumes so much  and they all masculine.. 

My body sprays are feminine. 

Oil is masculine.
2378 2018-08-06 19:41:41 My oil change and registration fell on the same week and oh my gawd it’s a drag to do those things I don’t mind paying but I hate doing car stuff 
2379 2018-08-06 19:41:36 throw them in the oven for like 20 minutes first, then the pan with lots of oil!!
2380 2018-08-06 19:41:36 You are burning more oil than gas
2381 2018-08-06 19:41:35 People that fry eggs with palm oil are kidnappers..
2382 2018-08-06 19:41:30 OPEC is flooding Canada with their rejects because they don't want Canadian oil&gas hitting the world market.OPEC is threatened by our product b/c it's humanely,environmentally,&safely produced.Also,Cdns are not buying the Islam bs that the ISIS Liberals are shoving in our faces!
2383 2018-08-06 19:41:29 At some point in the future, instead of a new air filter, the people who change the oil in your car will just offer to take all the money out of your bank account so it looks cleaner
2384 2018-08-06 19:41:12 Modern day pet Barnum snake oil salesman
2385 2018-08-06 19:41:10 Pad Thai curry paste, fish sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar and spices.
2386 2018-08-06 19:41:10 Does being so politically biased make you seem stupid or is it something you come by naturally? They buy oil from AB. Railcars you know.  They roll on. As will KSA oil. As will bad political posturing
2387 2018-08-06 19:41:00 just put a fuck ton of coconut oil in your hair
2388 2018-08-06 19:40:52 I would be happy if Canada had no relationship at all with Saudi Arabia. A brutal backward, repressive regime. I do wish we did not buy billions of dollars worth of oil from them. We have lots of oil. Build a few pipelines and stop buying their  oil.
2389 2018-08-06 19:40:51 I am making fun of the "don't bake the cake crowd" and their apparent animosity towards consistency. My constant position is that whatever doesn't break the law, should be broadcasted. Just walking around holding my oil lamp looking for consistency.
2390 2018-08-06 19:40:47 There’s no oil in that pan tho
2391 2018-08-06 19:40:46 I mixed some pesto with olive oil and lemon juice!
2392 2018-08-06 19:40:38 What about the lies about Israel-Palestine? How much oil do you get, for hiding the truth about the fact, that Israel every day kills innocent men, women and children? And what about helping the refugees, the VICTIMS, from the contries YOU are BOMBING for the taxpayers money?
2393 2018-08-06 19:40:38 The last time social and economic development was sincerely planned and Nigeria made SUSTAINABLE progress was sadly late 40s and early 50s. Ever since our leaders have plotting against & buying off each other....and throwing huge oil revenues at projects.
2394 2018-08-06 19:40:37 I mean duh..of course when I come to Jiffy Lube y’all gone find hella other stuff wrong, but I ain’t ask y’all all that. I asked y’all to change my oil. Mind y’all business.
2395 2018-08-06 19:40:35 I think I just watched a mustang and Honda race ........ the Honda is burning oil...
2396 2018-08-06 19:40:33 たらこって美味いよな！
2397 2018-08-06 19:40:29 "We" don't prefer Saudi oil. Private oil companies do. Stop trying to shame your fellow Canadians for the decisions of unethical private corporations.

Those corporations export 500% more than they import regardless, including most of the NFLD oil that could supply eastern CAN
2398 2018-08-06 19:40:22 Well good news, the LAV deal is getting cancelled because of this so halfway there. Also, agreed on the oil.
2399 2018-08-06 19:40:16 Get the pipelines going we should NOT ever be reliant on Saudi Arabia or any country for our oil and gas!
2400 2018-08-06 19:40:13 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
2401 2018-08-06 19:40:12 Watermelon seed oil, ya welcome
2402 2018-08-06 19:40:11 Good news! Now suspend oil exports!!!
2403 2018-08-06 19:39:48 you think Earl J. Ritchie is a sientist? everyone can see that he used to teach a course for the oil and gas industry. obviously a lobbyist, appearing only in the context of your forbes source... too easy to understand the background 
2404 2018-08-06 19:39:42 Lol - thanks Dmac. 
 
I just think that the CONCEPT of a ND Permanent Fund Dividend is worth thinking about and discussing. Why not share some of that oil wealth (directly) with the people of ND? No offense to my pal Roscoe, but why do the politicians have to control ALL of it?
2405 2018-08-06 19:39:37 More and more countries do not not our dirty oils sands oil. Some some of the European countries will ban purchasing our dirty oil. Nothing can stop this. We must end our reliance this dirty oil
2406 2018-08-06 19:39:28 Trans Can ads running in Quebec assure the socialists, pretty well the entire political class: doesn't mean more development of our natural resources but does mean we'll be 'less dependent' on middle eastern conflict oil? nope ... our freedom-fighting partner/ally's oil 
2407 2018-08-06 19:39:24 Saw your face book post,  the only mirror oil beer is some great stout, could be another imperial stout
2408 2018-08-06 19:39:17 Do u know that Sally Jewell, Obama's secretary of interior got her start in the oil industry? She was neither a geologist or Forester either. I'm sure u weren't complaining about her.

2411 2018-08-06 19:38:05 אז ידעת ששמן קנולה זה ראשי תיבות של CANadian Oil Low Acid?
2412 2018-08-06 19:38:00 "We" don't buy a drop of oil. Private enterprise buys oil and there are plenty of other places to buy oil from.  Frankly private enterprise should be ashamed it buys that oil at all. But capitalism has no ethics...so?
2413 2018-08-06 19:37:59 Oil derivatives are  the #Saudi  code words for bombs
2414 2018-08-06 19:37:58 Iran will cheat, China will aid them n France n other allies will continue to buy oil n gas from Iran n Russia will begging USA to protect them.

2417 2018-08-06 19:37:28 So Libs/CPC wrong to sell oil,machinery,vehicles & >to US, which recently approved torture & targeted killings, as did UK, + started war based on lies that killed >100K+ civilians? No exports to China, Russia, known human rights abusers? #hypocritical outrage,double stds, eh?
2418 2018-08-06 19:37:26 I grow really delicious ones and the only un-cooked ones I like are in salsa or heavily marinated in basil/olive oil/sea salt with burrata or mozz. I can also like certain varieties on a really good BLT. Fave is bruchetta tho, roasting makes them sweet. Never straight raw tho.
2419 2018-08-06 19:37:08 Gotta get Midnight an oil change tmr.
2420 2018-08-06 19:36:58 You have oil but no refineries,we have the refineries in the east..
2421 2018-08-06 19:36:48 I too drilled them out before..painful. The reason they won't come out is they are not really a phillips head...they are JIS #3. But hitting them with some penetrating oil and a few licks with the impact driver and I was done....(even with phillips head)
2422 2018-08-06 19:36:44 building a pipeline only puts oil into the global market which is a highly subsidized uncompetitive product. china benefits, america benefits, but us not much. building more pipelines does nothing for our energy independence but it makes a nice pitch
2423 2018-08-06 19:36:42 To drive up oil prices and increase exports from Russia and China.. not sure who's winner here.
2424 2018-08-06 19:36:24 They put Lays olive oil and citron chips in mine once took weeks to get the smell off, now I sit last
2425 2018-08-06 19:36:21 so a lady at work accused me of stealing fried chicken and when i was questioned about it i said: “I know y’all change the fryer oil every 3 days.WHY WOULD I WANT THAT CHICKEN?!” 
2426 2018-08-06 19:36:18 Can I get that beard oil too?
2427 2018-08-06 19:36:13 You misunderstand. I want Canadian oil to flow east to Canadian and foreign markets. I want it to flow west to Asia and I want it to flow south to Texas. There is no need for imported oil. Period.

2434 2018-08-06 19:35:27 The oil filter is for the single gear reduction drive. It’s not engine filter that has to be replaced every 3000 miles. Tesla is aiming for 1M mile lifetime on this new drivetrain. It’s the same one being used in the Semi truck...
2435 2018-08-06 19:35:20 from the front (near the oil pan/engine) or towards the rear like exhaust area?

Re. Oil - that was about the vast wealth of Scottish oil discovered in the 70’s and concealed for 30 years by the McCrone Report. Vast amounts of money spent on London - while Scotland was left in dire poverty. Worth a read.

2448 2018-08-06 19:34:17 “Ethical western oil” cracks me up. No such thing exists.
2449 2018-08-06 19:34:16 I never understood why the western world turns a blind eye to countries like Saudi Arabia, who stone women to death. No oil money is worth selling out our values. We are nothing alike. We have everything we need in Canada. Don't give in @JustinTrudeau and you'll keep my vote
2450 2018-08-06 19:34:05 Chain jewelry in a knot? Put olive oil on it, put it on a flat surface and pick it apart with needles. Then wash in soapy water
2451 2018-08-06 19:34:00 The Liberals got nailed virtue signalling to Saudi Arabia. They really don’t mean anything by it and aren’t serious nor would they ever take any action. Our oil industry needs to go through a gender analysis but they’re fine with Saudi oil. That’s how serious the Libs are.

2458 2018-08-06 19:33:17 On fuel efficiency requirements to cut oil dependence, RW pundits say they "take away your freedom to go anywhere". My hybrid goes Dallas-Austin-Dallas with no fuel stops and I'm still not on empty. Ever wonder why rails started adapting to fuel-electric nearly a century ago?
2459 2018-08-06 19:33:17 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

2466 2018-08-06 19:32:35 Maybe , but what we're talking about is now, not 2050 , and yoir country France attacked Libya not because you guys care and love its ppl but to access to cheap oil because you ll need it now to get to the 2050 goals.
2467 2018-08-06 19:32:34 Given the growing global
demand for vegetable oils, and the fact that oil palm
produces much more oil per area unit than other oil
crops, a shift from palm oil to other oil crops, does
not guarantee a net positive outcome for biodiversity.
2468 2018-08-06 19:32:33 Bear in mind Venezuela's economy was almost entirely dependent on oil, and as their oil production decreases alongside sanctions they're only going to do worse. You can find more in depth looks at what lead to it elsewhere, but I don't believe anyone uses Venezuala as an 1/
2469 2018-08-06 19:32:31 Don't count on this - In joint statement Mon, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini & foreign ministers of France, Germany & Britain said remaining parties to 2015 agreement will maintain "effective financial channels" with Iran- ensure its continued export of oil & gas.

2471 2018-08-06 19:32:09 Really?  Blaming Global Warming on the people who work to stop it?  Liberals and Progressives are trying to stop it, Conservatives and Oil/Coal companies would kill their grandchildren for a fast buck today.   Who is really to blame (Well, besides all of us for not doing enough.)
2472 2018-08-06 19:32:04 Your logic escapes me. On the one hand you don’t want oil imported into eastern Canada but you support a pipeline to export oil to Asia rather than one to make Canada energy self sufficient.
2473 2018-08-06 19:32:03 Well that’s a shitty then  I just wanna leave already. I pray to god I get this oil rig job 
2474 2018-08-06 19:31:58 You hold yourself an intelligent informed person.  You can't possibly believe this. 
You are an outright liar and an enemy of the truth. Utterly shameless lacking all self respect and dignity. 
Honest question, how do you live with yourself?
2475 2018-08-06 19:31:55 It ensures the the lubrication is proper for the option B which is provided in the answer section above. As if the oil is old/dirty, it can cause brake failure at any given point. A catastrophic event, so always maintain a good brake oil as braking is the most essential part.

2498 2018-08-06 19:29:20 Google also censor information about the disasters of oil leaks in the Gulf of Mexico to the citizens of United States. China isn’t the only country censoring our freedom of information. Censorship is everywhere.

2517 2018-08-06 19:27:22 I don’t know what your background is and I’m not going to be making any assumptions. That being said, you need to look ahead at the big picture, what industries are dying and why. Why invest in coal and oil? Invest in renewable energy. Train those people for those industries.
2518 2018-08-06 19:27:18 Oh no. Where is eastern Canada going to import it’s oil from now? God knows they won’t accept Alberta oil from the black sheep province. Maybe they will just buy more Venezuelan oil from their socialist sister country. Liberals!
2519 2018-08-06 19:27:07 I wonder if the Trudeau love affair in EasternCanada will last the winter?The Irving's won't be happy - they own the Maritimes.We may not be able to ship Alberta oil - but at least we got it, plus refineries when its 40 below.  There be something wicked coming down the tracks.
2520 2018-08-06 19:26:51 We should ban all Saudi oil into Canada.  They'll get message and then we could get Energy East pipeline started.
2521 2018-08-06 19:26:37 They really need to have a class on how to change your oil, check tire pressure, change your tire, pretty much do anything with your car other than putting gas in it bc I’m stuck in WV, clueless about to cry!!!!!!!
2522 2018-08-06 19:26:26 Why do you think they are entitled to my money? The trend is thievery, snake oil, theft of wages, more garbage than one could ever imagine while paying those crooks to be their product. Supply side is done. Capitalists please tell the truth, wear socks & tie your shoes!
2523 2018-08-06 19:26:17 I agree, I also believe we shouldn’t support them by buying billions worth of oil each year when we could be buying Canadian!
2524 2018-08-06 19:26:07 And when you say “our people” you mean the top 1%, right? You’re such a skeevy snake oil salesman. 
2525 2018-08-06 19:25:56 TBH, I would commission an oil painting of myself to look like this.

2540 2018-08-06 19:24:26 Of course they support Saudi Arabia.  They all share the same morals and values, or lack thereof.  Canada fucked itself by becoming reliant on their oil and by allowing them to buy up our country, including our Wheat Board.  We're screwed now.  @JustinTrudeau

2549 2018-08-06 19:23:39 I agree wholeheartedly with your point, but your estimate is a little high.  We import just under 100,000 barrels per day from Saudi, I think.  But why do we prefer Saudi, Nigerian and other oil imports over Canadian oil.  Makes zero sense.

2552 2018-08-06 19:23:17 I didn't know St John was going to receive Canadian oil via tanker ships.  Nor did I know it was not part of Canada and not accessible by land.  Thanks for the fake news Donald.

2555 2018-08-06 19:23:13 But in this case, cash inflow is diminished and all sectors including oil/gas are heavily affected. It is rather imposed than naturally selected.

2560 2018-08-06 19:22:53 ........but OK to import Saudi oil by tanker on the St Lawrence???
2561 2018-08-06 19:22:44 Canada broke diplomatic norms with their call to Saudi Arabia to release Saudi human rights campaigners. It was asked when the other Western powers will speak up. Not until the US needs more oil unfortunately.

2569 2018-08-06 19:22:09 It tends to go in cycles, anarchy is no better.

All that said, Canada has more than enough oil in the short term for out partner nations, we could fairly easily supply everyone if needed while we work on alternative energy sources.
2570 2018-08-06 19:22:09 the trees are weakened from beetles---and drought---climate change got your attention yet? You don't care about the environment, or science, you care about oil and gas companies who got you into a power job...ugh

2582 2018-08-06 19:20:02 Yes!
I use one of those pre-chopped bags (because I'm the worst) cut to bite-sized pieces. Toss in oil, garlic powder, lemon pepper, S&P, crushed red pepper. Cook on sheet at 475 for around 20 min (lightly charred), Squeeze fresh lemon over and then toss in parm. SERVE.
2583 2018-08-06 19:19:56 Well given it's the Trudeau govt. wouldn't be surprised if they tried to import mineral water from Saudi. Having the world's third largest oil reserves didn't stop them from importing oil.
2584 2018-08-06 19:19:48 We need to develop our oil industry & become self sufficient. We need to work out trade deals but should not be trading with people who export Wahabi Islam to our country & threaten us. It’s not our business to change Saudi laws but we need to stop associating with them. #cdnpoli
2585 2018-08-06 19:19:33 Totally.     They aren't happy with all the oil and water they take.  Step to far.
2586 2018-08-06 19:19:27 I agree but Trudy will run and repair the damage so his foundation is still getting contrubuted too.  Never want to use canadian Oil. That might be good for Canada

2589 2018-08-06 19:19:05 Yeah but, environuts who don’t want our oil in pipelines prefer we keep buying it from Saudis. We are making changes to stop burning fuel, but they refuse to acknowledge all of the other ways we use oil. Oil will still come out of the ground to make what those hypocrites use.

2591 2018-08-06 19:18:27 1. Trudeau signals we will be permanently dependent on Saudi illiberal oil instead of energy independent.

2. Saudi takes full advantage of its leveraged position.

3. Liberals blame “Drumpf” and the media helps them.

4. The sheeple of Canada’s support for the LPC grows.
2592 2018-08-06 19:18:26 My younger cousin moved into her dorm at AAMU and I just kno her mama aint prepare her to stay away from Omega Oil smh
2593 2018-08-06 19:18:13 Spilled Baby oil on the floor. Hilarity ensued. It was a 3 Stooges sketch. Me & a cane. I was only missing a banana peel.
2594 2018-08-06 19:18:03 Allow me to help you. Ditch the meat for beans & cheese. A whole chicken is cheaper than skinless breast. The dressing is expensive try oil, vinegar, & mustard. (Get packets from fast-food places). Veggies are cheapest, make soup. Good try.
2595 2018-08-06 19:17:46 If a liberal show harassed the parents of shooting victims, said the government was turning frogs gay & was selling bullshit suppliment snake oil, then I'm totally cool with Facebook axing them. I don't give shit who facebook or Youtube ejects, I have other ways to consume media.
2596 2018-08-06 19:17:44 You can get it in Aldi where the olive oil etc is, brilliant stuff. Xx
2597 2018-08-06 19:17:41 In all seriousness, the folks in Saudi are NOT nice people entirely. We know what happened on 9/11/01 & who did it.  And we have continued to reward and protect their economic interests. Ban Middle East oil from Canada. Period!
2598 2018-08-06 19:17:39 Keep licking the boots of Royalty, while they murder children in Yemen. Goodbye Evil man. Saudi will run out of oil and blood money and your caring government will make you a slave.
2599 2018-08-06 19:17:38 forgot i have to go get a oil change . guess i won’t be going straight home 
2600 2018-08-06 19:17:36 Just wait til@they cut off oil shipments, watch the pain hit east coast as we can’t get energy east built fast enough! Trudeau’s downfall will be that if nothing before it!

2602 2018-08-06 19:17:34 ...and stop your BS. The day western democracies stop militarily backing your country and buying your oil, Iranians will come to take over your desert. So back off and stay quiet. In Canada, this human right thing is just for internat use, dont panic like this.
2603 2018-08-06 19:17:30 Excuse me? Kuwait was stealing oil from Iraqs fields. Yanks decided to side with Kuwait, for political reasons too complicated to explain in a Tweet.
2604 2018-08-06 19:17:19 Check your Engine oil this morning.
2605 2018-08-06 19:17:14 Good way to use wilted spinach: sautée in olive oil, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The nutmeg noes some sort of magic go make it taste amazing 
2606 2018-08-06 19:17:09 @HawleyMO I need to know your stance on medical marijuana before I can vote for you. I couldn't find any answers online or on your website. I'm also wondering if you've seen the positive effects of CBD oil in children with epilepsy and your views on that. Thanks for your time.
2607 2018-08-06 19:17:06 take the protagonist and magnify it until it is allegro. if oil appears mature, mix until radioactive. flip over and repeat until direct. if possible, make sure your pot comes from munich.
2608 2018-08-06 19:17:05 You're relying on a linear forecast that has been compiled by an oil company.

If plastics can be replaced by something else, such as graphene; then expect a new industry to emerge out of that overnight. Look at the recent weed industry.
2609 2018-08-06 19:17:03 This Saudi tweet threatening Canada with a 9-11 image is making me reconsider Canada's Kinder-Morgan pipeline.  Let's use Canadian oil now, mine Nickel and Cobalt for a battery powered future, and stop dealing with these petro-States at all. 

@JustinTrudeau #SaudiArabia
2610 2018-08-06 19:16:59 It's like if you took a match to Oil Ocean in Sonic 2.
2611 2018-08-06 19:16:51 I didn't know the US stood for egalitarian principles!!! I heard about the genocide of indigenous, the slavery then the endless wars for oil, three main stages in US history. nothing about egalitarian principles.

2613 2018-08-06 19:16:42 Hey incoming IBuddies! If you lost your summer reading packet on vacation, spilled soda or suntan oil on it, or your dog ate it... come get another one or check Google Classroom tonight at 5 pm!
2614 2018-08-06 19:16:37 I met with MlA Littlewood on Friday.  No logs... doesn’t need them apparently to submit. Has a spreadsheet she keeps but didn’t feel it needed to be shared.   I think the whole mileage and gas and oil change system needs a complete overhaul.
2615 2018-08-06 19:16:34 Had to get 2 new tires, a new engine filter, and an alignment. I just brought my car in for an oil change.
2616 2018-08-06 19:16:30 I miss painting with acrylic/oil colors
2617 2018-08-06 19:16:15 Where will your Liberal friends get their oil now?  They don’t want Canadian oil but prefer to support countries with limited human rights
2618 2018-08-06 19:16:14 I have thick 4C hair & I really enjoy all the products from Creme of Nature, the ones made with Argon Oil. Maybe she can start with those
2619 2018-08-06 19:16:09 @UnionBankInn, Albertans making their living from the oil & gas industry don't want to patronise a business that associates itself with an organisation actively campaigning to end our livelihoods, like @WasteFreeYEG  -part of radical anti-energy lobbyists @ecojustice_ca
2620 2018-08-06 19:15:56 Doubtful.. When you withdraw from something that was verified compliant & have no plan... That's not safe at all.  What's wrong?  Trump figure out he can't really put Tarrifs on Iran since they mainly export oil so sanctions them instead? No wonder everyone hates us.#DotardConMan
2621 2018-08-06 19:15:46 Stir together 9 oz dandelion greens with 2 tablespoons Garlic. Blend with Olive Oil. Roast. Serve over basmati rice.
2622 2018-08-06 19:15:40 New tires, oil changed, engine and transmission checked, new spare tire w/ a cover, waxed and cleaned, and a full tank of gas..... God is good
2623 2018-08-06 19:15:36 Oil ends higher as Iran sanctions, Saudi output drop boost prices
2624 2018-08-06 19:15:29 Your olive oil turns pesto into YESto 
2625 2018-08-06 19:15:21 to clarify, for the off-shore oil rig story I wrote months ago :)
2626 2018-08-06 19:15:13 acting like he never seen a female come in for a fucking oil change
2627 2018-08-06 19:15:08 "The craziest and nastiest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2628 2018-08-06 19:15:05 I’m telling you, but ya zamuyi we have to hustle
2629 2018-08-06 19:14:52 My anxiety has been so bad lately, bro CDB oil took it away wow
2630 2018-08-06 19:14:51 We dont need your oil. We have plenty thank you!. Saudis should apologize for all their atrocities including 911!
2631 2018-08-06 19:14:47 Cant wait for my Utique Face & Hair Oil to arrive..... eeeeekkkkk!!
2632 2018-08-06 19:14:46 éste oil de Sour D ... 
2633 2018-08-06 19:14:41 *45 and his buddy Vlad would prefer for Russia to sell us oil.
2634 2018-08-06 19:14:34 Coconut oil, that will help, I swear by the stuff babe, burns, sunburn, prickly heat, cuts, even cold sores x
2635 2018-08-06 19:14:23 Well, kind of proves the point. AND their sacrifice gave us the cheap oil and gas to end ourselves off!
2636 2018-08-06 19:14:18 Tourism deff took a hit for a few years. Europeans won’t go to oil slicked beaches in Florida. Same goes for red tide. Tourism Killer. They’ll say “Why does Florida smell like New Jersey?”
2637 2018-08-06 19:14:10 if you are looking for fast decomp of woody matter, I've seen some nice work done using culinary mushroom-inoculated chainsaw bar oil. might help speed succession for you.
2638 2018-08-06 19:14:05 The Carters strike oil in the basement and Stuart declares himself Pub-Dictator, and Kat falls victim to the twin's curse and turns into a motorised hatstand #eastenders
2639 2018-08-06 19:14:03 I think Justin & Crystia are marching in parades. May be a good place for them to minimize damage. Yes we needed Energy East many years ago and still do. Canada shld ban Middle East oil and force Quebec/East to deal with it. Maybe he tune changes. Maybe not.
2640 2018-08-06 19:13:53 I miss when my coconut oil wasn’t liquid 
2641 2018-08-06 19:13:38 Sometimes. But tonight I added truffle oil instead.
2642 2018-08-06 19:13:21 The Energy East pipeline would take oil to tide water, load it on tankers and ship it abroad. There was money in the project to improve port facilities and no money to improve or build refineries.
None of the pipeline projects include refining in Canada; all are for export.
2643 2018-08-06 19:13:19 Cut off Saudi oil imports immediately
2644 2018-08-06 19:13:10 Use tumeric, flour, olive oil and yoghurt 
It's been helping me lots
2645 2018-08-06 19:13:04 Ya Seriously think Trump will dismiss the OIL GODS??  Saudi Arabia cause more disruption in Middle East than Iran!!

2648 2018-08-06 19:12:30 Is that @Jasonthekid23 ?
2649 2018-08-06 19:12:26 And his snake oil totally SUXKS
2650 2018-08-06 19:12:09 Damaging our coastline and what do we get? Oil spills on our coastline
2651 2018-08-06 19:11:55 I want to make my cake today. I have the dough. I have the molds. What I don't have is something vegan that will stay put on a non-stick surface. Maybe I can flour the molds with olive oil... shoot, won't work. Cake.
2652 2018-08-06 19:11:40 also destroyer of the oil industry oligarchy 
2653 2018-08-06 19:11:39 His "take" on Sandy Hook and this harassment of parents / survivors render his political stance obsolete. He's a snake oil salesman.
2654 2018-08-06 19:11:34 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2655 2018-08-06 19:11:24 Boring they always speak a bout code black oil spil like A shit
2656 2018-08-06 19:11:18 Eh...no. That's wrong, even before you factor in the oil.
2657 2018-08-06 19:11:17 Why .. why without Facebook, Twitter, Podcasts and Youtube how is po Alex Jones going to peddle is PRIMARY business of hocking so called herbal supplements and snake oil hormones!. Why he might have to resort to.. gawd forbid a real job!
2658 2018-08-06 19:11:15 Turned on the stove and sat down. Went to put the oil in the pan now, I turned on the wrong hob. I’m really fed up of today.
2659 2018-08-06 19:11:03 Eastern refineries can't process much of current prodction, which is bitumen.  The conventional oil is mostly gone.
2660 2018-08-06 19:10:53 It looks like an oil bottle you know for elderly users 
2661 2018-08-06 19:10:51 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2662 2018-08-06 19:10:49 Yikes. Try Avon skin so soft dry oil. Apparently midges hate it.
2663 2018-08-06 19:10:29 Nope, the standardards are all well documented in the TOS. The sboke oil salesman is just another example of how this man had always been a fraud. He was just arguing in court that everything he sis is fiction.
2664 2018-08-06 19:10:28 The government virtue signalled with a zero leverage, zero power position and got its hands slapped hard. Saudi knows Eastern Canada depends heavily on its oil and moreover that Trudeau is not disposed to change that. Ever.
2665 2018-08-06 19:10:25 Decarbing some White Nightmare wax for my oil rn
2666 2018-08-06 19:10:22 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
2667 2018-08-06 19:10:04 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
2668 2018-08-06 19:09:42 actually most US oil is homegrown
2669 2018-08-06 19:09:32 My claim is: without the oil, Venezuela and Colombia would have similar levels of GDP/capita today.

What is your claim?
2670 2018-08-06 19:09:30 Add you some cashew cream or palm oil sauce for good measure, eh?
2671 2018-08-06 19:09:20 Hey jack ass why you so worried about water being diverted into ocean . But it’s ok for the water in the standing rock Indian reservation to be polluted and sacred ground destroyed for your useless oil pipeline .#YOUREONINDIANLAND#NODAPL#WATERISLIFE
2672 2018-08-06 19:09:03 Nooo!! . My life has been a lie!  Now I have to buy canned coffee just to have a can for the oil.
2673 2018-08-06 19:08:59 wowowowowow I been sleepin TOO long on cbd oil this shit is DA BOMB DOT COM
2674 2018-08-06 19:08:57 That’s your own tangent. I said find out when UAE found oil and how many years they took to start developing then do the same with Nigeria. You’ll be able to tell if Nigeria is lagging that way. Also consider oil reserves
2675 2018-08-06 19:08:56 If you’re muslim, you definitely have to be vigilant. Places like #Bridlington & #Scarborough are full of uneducated racist people. Got told by a fish and chip shop that “We’re all traditional ere” when i asked if the food was cooked in vegetable oil.
2676 2018-08-06 19:08:52 Good for you! #PutinsPuppet is acting on behalf of #Putin wishes because #Puting does not want competition from #Iran over oil
2677 2018-08-06 19:08:43 Gummys flower oil spoil yourself lots of deals right meow
2678 2018-08-06 19:08:43 where is @JustinTrudeau to comment about this Saudi and Oil issue?
2679 2018-08-06 19:08:34 OPEC is slowly evolving with the times. A few of the ministers are now responsible for ENERGY, and not just OIL. This entails everything. The countries that are still focused on oil will end up losing in the long term. The oil should only be exported, and consumed less at home.
2680 2018-08-06 19:08:27 They said hopefully won’t be too serious or expensive errrr I can guarantee it will be more expensive than what a litre of oil would have been 
2681 2018-08-06 19:08:24 Mines tripped out when i put too thick of oil in it. It was sputterin n stuff
2682 2018-08-06 19:08:24 @ProblemWright pro I have been working on cars since I have been in diapers shoot me a dm I could help more but speed sensor and oil flush have no relation
2683 2018-08-06 19:08:17 I hope so but not knowing that from reading the label will make me boycott it, like I do all other products that say palm oil.
2684 2018-08-06 19:08:14 Darn I’m going to miss his snake oil sales pitch lol
2685 2018-08-06 19:08:12 sounds like oil, or diamonds in africa
2686 2018-08-06 19:08:12 didn’t they have those truffle oil fries?
2687 2018-08-06 19:08:09 Canada has oil.
2688 2018-08-06 19:08:07 Baffling to think most unemployed folks are not employable... But what do I know? I Know someone that failed the UBA aptitude 56 and passed a top oil firm aptitude, following week.. So Mr employable meter, kpom kpi sir
2689 2018-08-06 19:08:03 Been waiting for my work van too get an oil change for 2 hours already fml
2690 2018-08-06 19:07:46 yes they should. in france and italy i often see it on packages. so it makes me suspicious when it only says vegetable oil. i will do so indeed. lets see...
2691 2018-08-06 19:07:41 Who get money for Ransome ? When govt no serious
2692 2018-08-06 19:07:33 It's really easy, you just fill the bottle up with vitamin E oil, add in a bunch of little spoonfuls of highlighter, close the bottle tight, and shake it to mix everything together. It definitely helps to have a funnel of some sort for the highlighter, which I didn't have. 
2693 2018-08-06 19:07:32 Bruh i just did a facial mask and followed up with the aloe vera coconut oil moisturizer...
2694 2018-08-06 19:07:22 IT was an OIL TANKER TRUCK! 
2695 2018-08-06 19:07:19 That’s not to say there aren’t any problems, many of which look to me like they relate to the shift from trade surplus to trade deficit and OPEC manipulating oil prices starting in the mid-1970s and a substantial increase in immigration, which increases the labor supply.
2696 2018-08-06 19:07:09 Don’t worry Susan.  Always an #avgeek.  Plus soon we can discuss oil prices and fuel hedging.
2697 2018-08-06 19:06:53 Sad but true. But our devotion to Israel is not based on logic either. Also human rights abusers. They don't have oil, but they have the evangelicals under their thumbs.
2698 2018-08-06 19:06:48 people that use oil r not people
2699 2018-08-06 19:06:48 They go on about rig Decommissioning but it was them that sat on their arses years ago and Dundee lost out on major oil work. Chancers the lot o them.

2701 2018-08-06 19:06:28 How long we are exempt from offshore drilling is up in the air too. I don’t think any of us will forget the BP oil spill. As a gulf coast resident, I can remember blobs of oil showing up on gulf coast beaches. Not cool.
2702 2018-08-06 19:06:27 Na olive oil I go dey use for fuel if I buy that kind motor. Cuz it’s only the blood of Jesus that can save you from the mountain of problem.
2703 2018-08-06 19:06:03 A friend suggested CBD oil too so I am going to try that x
2704 2018-08-06 19:05:51 Over a pot of boiling oil?
2705 2018-08-06 19:05:39 With Canada's deteriorating relationship with Saudi Arabia, how ironic would it be if it was their refusal to sell us oil that suddenly made the Energy East pipeline in our national interest? @WorkForceDel Danielle Smith #Energy TransCanada
2706 2018-08-06 19:05:39 While at the grocery store yesterday i put a bottle of olive oil in the buggy and didn’t say anything. Olivia look and said “That’s for your hair, right?”  #naturalhairproblems
2707 2018-08-06 19:05:38 Things I can't consume on Whole30, ranked by hardest to avoid to easiest:

1) Added sugar: nearly impossible. It's in everything.
2) Grains: bread + corn-based products are also ubiquitous.
3) Legumes: peanuts / peanut oil are what'll get ya.
4) Dairy
5) Booze
2708 2018-08-06 19:05:33 @AAAauto in north riverside, Illinois on Harlem just played the hell out of me. I will never in life go back there again!!!! Went in for a “free oil change” left with my radio screen locked and they can’t fix it after they drained my battery. The con game is real out here.
2709 2018-08-06 19:05:30 I didn’t realize there were so many people out there that don’t understand what the first amendment is for. I know you’re mad the snake oil salesman is getting pulled, but this isn’t even close to being a freedom of speech issue.
2710 2018-08-06 19:05:29 Problem, Harris has so much dirt being the former AG of California, no chance it won’t be brought up during the oil spills in California and propagating the corn lobby. Terrible choice.
2711 2018-08-06 19:05:18 Don’t forget that, logically, oil producers don’t want Iran in the market for China and India. Oil producers like US, Russia, etc. Still feels to me that Russia wants to expand oil exports to goose their economy/pockets. And that’s what this is still about.

2728 2018-08-06 19:04:09 And for those unfamiliar with old aircraft piston-engines, if it isn't leaking a little oil, it probably means it's out of oil.
2729 2018-08-06 19:04:07 @chickfila02895  just got waffle fries and was a little disappointed they tasted like old oil, might wanna change it...
2730 2018-08-06 19:04:03 Because oil.
2731 2018-08-06 19:04:01 any  chance  we  can  ensure  that  next  tanker  of  oil ,  is  also  on  time  ready  to  ship
2732 2018-08-06 19:03:59 Gripe water and lavender oil to sooth fussy/colicky babies
2733 2018-08-06 19:03:57 The east could have switched to Alberta oil if the idiot running this country hadnt blocked the Energy East pipeline but he would rather have the east coast import oil from islamic dictatorships
2734 2018-08-06 19:03:43 Umm did you see the real news where the USA has taken the lead in becoming the biggest oil and natural gas supplier in the world? We conservatives are all about ENERGY INDEPENDENCE and using OUR OWN OIL dumb dumb. Can you show me how much Iraqi oil we now own?? NONE!!
2735 2018-08-06 19:03:36 Got my oil changed &this fool forgot to screw the bolt in all the way so now I got NO FUCKING OIL IN MY CAR
2736 2018-08-06 19:03:19 Filmus la nafta y el gas oil se pueden ir a $ 500 el litro. Pero verlos a Uds revolcarse,patalear y por último presos eso no tiene precio. Todo lo demás se arregla con la de débito o crédito
2737 2018-08-06 19:03:12 قابل نداشت
2738 2018-08-06 19:03:10 They produce oil lol
2739 2018-08-06 19:03:09 Raising taxes on oil and gas production could cost me my job and my family their food on the table so why does everyone think they can just take away the whole industry??? #Oklahoma is becoming such a selfish state #okleg #oklaed
2740 2018-08-06 19:03:04 Anytime! I absolutely love your olive oil and will always support small business 
2741 2018-08-06 19:03:03 The sad thing is, I was using an odorless solvent (Turpenoid) .  But my room is small with little air circulation so that doesn’t help.  Think I’ll try using walnut oil to clean my brushes during painting, seems to be a good alternative.
2742 2018-08-06 19:03:02 First they came for infowars, and I was ok with it because Jones is a snake oil salesman who caused the harassment of the Sandy Hook parents
2743 2018-08-06 19:02:49 can run it through their Irish refinery ...  the one that was going to spin all the oil sands pipeline product in the EU  ....   perhaps ....

2747 2018-08-06 19:02:15 Oh no no one said anything about stopping oil shipments Saudi will still send their oil here and we will still buy it like a bunch of schmucks. We will stamp our feet and openly condemn them for the expulsion of our diplomat but the oil will still flow.
2748 2018-08-06 19:02:15 what'd you do for the shine baby oil?
2749 2018-08-06 19:02:09 Yeah, that’s usually the tricky part x3 Try some more flour, a bit more oil and make them a bit thinner and it should be more firm :3
2750 2018-08-06 19:02:05 You Must Be Drinking That Black Seed Oil! Lol Its On Sale?

2752 2018-08-06 19:02:02 Ever had a chocolate candy with a peanut cream filling?
American peanut butter tastes like that. It's real sweet. 
My favorite peanut butter is essentially ground peanuts with some salt and oil. Maybe a bit of sugar. It's not sweet.
2753 2018-08-06 19:01:50 We've been using a c60 oil in Shea butter topically at home for a little while now. Great stuff! :)
2754 2018-08-06 19:01:33 Don’t worry Susan.  Always an #avgeek.  Soon we can discuss oil and fuel hedging.
2755 2018-08-06 19:01:30 I only smoke at night before bed, so i would do the same w/the oil. I'm not alone here, not that I'm glad y'all have issues, but we can relate to each other. When people see me park in the handicapped spot, I get dirty looks at times. They cant see what's going on in my body.
2756 2018-08-06 19:01:10 Not at all. As soon as they pay our defense budget and we can use their oil subsidies. Green light.
2757 2018-08-06 19:01:09 I dont believe anything about this Venezuela assassination fuckry.  For all I know, this is an inside job with the current administration as an attempt to get their dirty hands on the oil.

2762 2018-08-06 19:00:43 Hes been fighting elitists his whole career. Called out 9/11, shady oil deals, falsities of the Iraq War, etc BEFORE ANYONE ELSE. You're a sheep for the establishment. Hes not right 100% but hes been right enough times. He may not be right but hes not lying. Know the difference
2763 2018-08-06 19:00:42 I remember reading the great Roman historian & oracle, ALputzus GOREdouchèmus, predicting back in AD 500 that in 1500 years air conditioning & oil would cause the world to melt.

2766 2018-08-06 19:00:28 The Saudi's are under pressure from someone.  They have been raping the Canadian oil industy forever so I see no logical reason for this action although it might force Junior to get the East/West pipeline built.
2767 2018-08-06 19:00:27 Ah shit, coconut oil helps with beard tho
2768 2018-08-06 19:00:26 2. The oil industry doesn’t appear2have helped the area to date, why would that suddenly make a difference now?

2783 2018-08-06 18:59:00 Next will be the small farmers producing soybeans, dairy and pecans. This is #notmaga. Wake up America, @realDonaldTrump is a snake oil salesman!
2784 2018-08-06 18:58:50 Just try for once to be specific instead of selling snake oil generalized fear. You won't cause you can't. Sell yourself to a believer, the one in the mirror!
2785 2018-08-06 18:58:45 Offering a personal deal behind closed doors is first and foremost. Real Estate, oil, or some other deal that Trump would benefit from is the driver of his foreign policy.
2786 2018-08-06 18:58:35 You're first friends with politicians not real Americans. Your oil is covered in blood

2788 2018-08-06 18:58:34 Same could be said for gold, silver, other precious metal (or oil to some degree... thought that is ofcourse eventually used up). Essentially any resource that is desired. So i disagree that it is unique or „once“ only.
2789 2018-08-06 18:58:30 Cooking! Instead of using regular olive oil you can throw one of these in the pan to melt. I think they will be good for potatoes or meat or mushrooms!

2827 2018-08-06 18:54:47 Here’s a thought @JustinTrudeau why not focus on #CANADA and making CANADA better? Why are we so concerned about what happens on another continent? We have enough oil here to sustain us, quit selling it. I hate to say I agree with Trump by putting CANADA first we can only thrive!
2828 2018-08-06 18:54:40 One. This is not kumbya bullshit. People are in prison. Gay people are beaten. 2. He was a math teacher. 3 the govt doesn't buy oil. Cmon man, I know you love this country and province. Be better.

2830 2018-08-06 18:54:38 Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran. A move which benefits Russia and their oil exports and also one that further alienates US' European allies. Ultimately, a move which further fragments the globe. #TrumpRussia #WorldNews

I'd not wear a wimple for oil.  Britain has a role as a transformative refuge wherein people must be allowed to find their fearless self.
2842 2018-08-06 18:53:13 Wow. @CalgaryGeorge is clearly talking about approving Energy East pipeline so Canadian oil can be shipped instead of buying Saudi Oil. No mention of NEP. Twitter hurts my head most days. Wow wow wow.

2849 2018-08-06 18:52:30 Why? We have trade relations. They are kicking us out and soon that trade will be stopped. We trade with them for oil mostly (or for what I’ve heard) and with that stopping and the pipline not built yet and the USA tariffs were not doing that well
2850 2018-08-06 18:52:25 Oil is basically fossils. So in a way, fossils are found under the sea.
2851 2018-08-06 18:52:21 Yes dropping Oil prices contributed to it but wasn’t the main factor. Also if the oil had been privatized then they would have been able to compete. The Venezuela government, being a government is highly inefficient and has no idea how to run an industry.

2855 2018-08-06 18:52:12 Yes Ma'am. 
My point is that the word foodstuffs is used deliberately. 
● The issue is export and import.
● All US Allies must comply.

For example Savola Behshahr Company imports sunflower seeds to produce cooking oil. They import from the UKRAINE.   The Ukraine is a US Ally

2866 2018-08-06 18:50:51 Wouldn't be so foolish if N Korea, not S.A, had the blessing of biggest oil reserves & had a rain of money, support, & sweet support of BBC with the major West powers like the UK and the US. Then we would see our brave independent BBC spouting every day about how bad S. A is :)

2868 2018-08-06 18:50:43 The EU is also an older population than the US. Age can play a contributing factor with violent crime rates.
2869 2018-08-06 18:50:41 A lot of religious headgear use is actually fallout because certain royal families were artificially elevated to create oil trade. It gave them an undue level of hegemonic power to influence national religious tendencies.

Make sure people appreciate that is the root.
2870 2018-08-06 18:50:35 Iran needs to give oil to USA,  and  more deals to USA companies. That is just a simple password to Iran. Lol.
2871 2018-08-06 18:50:16 Sadly, that's how all HoAs are in the country.
2872 2018-08-06 18:50:01 Maintain it was all just to stifle WH threats of granting waivers, unless OPEC prod'ed more oil. In the end it only hurt the price that already hurting Permian prod'ers received, bringing in wails of protest from that quarter. WH in a constant state of ceteris paribus "strategy".
2873 2018-08-06 18:50:01 Oh I know. He is easily played by other leaders becuz he desperately wants other men to think hes "strong"(which oddly enough makes him look weak & pathetic) but he has surrounded himself w/oil barons & wall street hacks who benefit the MOST while throwing his trash family a bone
2874 2018-08-06 18:49:51 NATO is meant to protect the EU from Russia that it gives billions to in oil. Russia, in turn funnels uranium that Obama sold to them to Iran to dominate in the Middle East & annihilate Israel.
@SteveSchmidtSES wants attention.
2875 2018-08-06 18:49:51 We all noticed when it was disclosed that there would be no NEW business. I’m sure the oil is slotted into old business and eastern Canada will be saved. #thankyougeezus
2876 2018-08-06 18:49:42 I wouldn't have to worry about much besides clean water, food &coconut oil

2879 2018-08-06 18:49:33 @kaifragrance Hi do you have any oil free body lotions? x
2880 2018-08-06 18:49:30 I’m not understanding.Trump danced around w/an orb thinking he’d been given the keys to The Kingdom. Trudeau simply spoke up for the protesters. Saudi Arabia applies Sharia law, therefore, there is no penal code. Saudi’s have oil & they know no country cares if a protester dies
2881 2018-08-06 18:49:29 Oil. Change.
2882 2018-08-06 18:49:22 Dear @RealAlexJones, now that you have been shut down on several social media platforms, how will you continue to fund your Rolex habit? Do you have contingency plans in place to continue to sell your snake oil to listeners? Thanks in advance. #AlexJones #AlexJonesShow
2883 2018-08-06 18:49:21 I'm totally against creating any more "free" Muslim countries because they only end up not free, dominated by western oil companies and poor despite lucrative natural resources. #NoMoreSovereigntyMovements
2884 2018-08-06 18:49:21 first time oil painting was great
2885 2018-08-06 18:49:17 @realDonaldTrump Everything depends on the full boycott of oil, we are very sensitive to the sanctions on oil and we will never accept the exemption. The end of Iran's oil, the end of the Iranian regime
2886 2018-08-06 18:49:11 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
2887 2018-08-06 18:49:09 You know nothing about the environment orCAasyou have demonstrated repeatedly I suppose fracking doesn’t cause earthquakes and offshore oil drilling doesn’t cause oil spills (you know, the drilling you approved off our coast)! POS
2888 2018-08-06 18:48:59 The world hasn’t forgotten that the 9-11 conspirator pilots were all Saudi. One day soon the world won’t want their oil and the Saudi economy will be reliant on two things. The support of their allies and the sale of dates.
2889 2018-08-06 18:48:47 What about the oil reserves? Heard that some reserves have been discovered
2890 2018-08-06 18:48:40 Or, perhaps we have a moral imperative to free ourselves from oil purchased from countries who execute homosexuals and atheists. #canadaeast
2891 2018-08-06 18:48:39 Just how much oil do we get from Saudi?
2892 2018-08-06 18:48:32 Living in the deep south, I've had that rule for years. Doctors offices, oil change waiting rooms - if @FoxNews is on, I ask them politely to change it to @weatherchannel. If they refuse, I tell them why I'm leaving, and go.  Only once have they not complied.
2893 2018-08-06 18:48:21 Hopefully saudis will cutoff exports to oil to cda, will get the oil price highet
2894 2018-08-06 18:48:06 If we can run Thousands of miles of oil pipelines across our country, why can’t we run water pipelines from the ocean inland. Naturally filter it or desalinate it at the destination. Let’s turn the Mojave Dessert into a damn rainforest. Better idea than that stupid train.
2895 2018-08-06 18:47:53 My car says it needs an oil change but it really doesn’t 
2896 2018-08-06 18:47:40 During last 5 months license were auctioned. I was just pointing out how oil exploration halted due to N's priorities.
2897 2018-08-06 18:47:37 Lol...nice. I’m getting an oil change right now so taking a little break but, brought my stuff to do some writing from here. #winning
2898 2018-08-06 18:47:29 Love to hear a discussion about the validity of using domestic terrorist groups such as @TigerSwan to violently quell people attempting to protect their only source of clean drinking water from the oil companies.

2903 2018-08-06 18:47:18 I just ordered tamanu oil cause it’s good for everything!
2904 2018-08-06 18:47:15 Tell saudi arabia to go f&$k themselves.  We have plenty of our on oil and we tend to treat everyone with respect  Women have been voting and driving here for years and it’s worked out just fine.  Pick your battles SA. No more political prisoners...

2908 2018-08-06 18:46:52 While we are at it lets blockade our oil from reaching Eastern markets and then import oil from Saudi Arabia. That will show them we mean business.

2911 2018-08-06 18:46:36 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2912 2018-08-06 18:46:31 Is that really how you feel ? You need to read more.Maybe start with some article on the oil industry. You have no idea how oil works do you.
2913 2018-08-06 18:46:28 Fuck I hope not. Can we not buy a defender who’s turning circle is not that of an oil tanker?
2914 2018-08-06 18:46:25 Northern man calls Farage, salivating over the idea that African migrants will boost the far right in Spain. I'd like to see him fried in olive oil.

2916 2018-08-06 18:46:24 A bottle of oil fell out of the cabinet and onto our giant bowl which shattered into a million pieces and flew everywhere.

2918 2018-08-06 18:46:05 @realDonaldTrump no bank should be With the Iranian regime, the Treasury Department and the State Department are following these issues carefully and will not be exempted from any country. From now until the next three months, our only goal is to bring Iran's oil exports to zero
2919 2018-08-06 18:46:00 Yep, exactly how@I make them except no pepper for me.  I also use the olive oil mayo.
2920 2018-08-06 18:45:59 True , but Standard Oil and US Steel still around to this day . Can’t say FB can survive 20 years let alone 100
2921 2018-08-06 18:45:57 Adopt her already
2922 2018-08-06 18:45:55 But it does have an irrational goal...the same one as we had in Iraq: WAR...for the sake of regime change that we keep thinking will give us limitless oil & global dominance. We've been trying to manipulate the middle east for DECADES, and it always backfires. When will we learn?
2923 2018-08-06 18:45:41 if you appreciate the Canadian culture and community values then you would also appreciate the absolute right to speak out against any human rights abuses. #Saudi is not a special snowflake country immune from criticism because of your money and oil.
2924 2018-08-06 18:45:35 Not true.
I worked there and my ex colleagues tell me a different story I am still in contact. Total mismanagement and corruption is the cause.
They disowned billion and billions from American companies. 
They have more oil reserve than Saudia Arabia.
Stop spewing lies.
2925 2018-08-06 18:45:29 It’s not from plants or dinosaurs. Oil was place there by Odin when the earth was created 10,000 years ago.
2926 2018-08-06 18:45:27 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they do it doggy style

2929 2018-08-06 18:45:03 @safridis What do you make of these two reports? That is, the talk of an imminant oil discovery near the Iranian border and this news that the previous govt didn't auctioned any oil exploration blocks for more than 4 years?
2930 2018-08-06 18:44:57 oh i know it's cooked in it but i meant it doesn't leave everything tasting of peanuts. Just like olive oil doesn't leave things tasting like olives
2931 2018-08-06 18:44:44 Ok however under obama we became the top oil producer in the world.....
2932 2018-08-06 18:44:42 Now that Alex Jones has been effectively removed we must all hope that the sandy hook families take him for literally everything and leave him on the street selling his vitamins and supplements from a cart like the snake oil salesman he is.
2933 2018-08-06 18:44:38 Recently purchased your facial oil when it came in the set of two on QVC. I wish I'd discovered it sooner, it's luxurious and my skin feels so juicy. Wouldn't be without it now 
2934 2018-08-06 18:44:38 I love the new bottle for the face oil. So simple and clean.
2935 2018-08-06 18:44:26 Lol. The other day i took my Honda to get an oil change , when they changed the filter they added NO OIL. So when I went ape shit they said you have to “ ask” for oil its extra!!!

2937 2018-08-06 18:44:20 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
2938 2018-08-06 18:44:15 Have a look at the Czech Republic. Czechs are able to own full-auto guns with a collector's license and carry of handguns for self-defense is also legal.
2939 2018-08-06 18:44:07 A price on carbon would help us innovate and shift away from oil. And we could focus on Saudi oil.
2940 2018-08-06 18:44:03 Till you got high cholesterol, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease AND cancer  eliminate the butter all together!! We on olive oil now sis
2941 2018-08-06 18:44:01 @foundmyfitness I have been taking Algal-900 DHA and I didn't realize that it was not from fish oil. Is there a difference in the forms of supplemental DHA or is it all the same??
2942 2018-08-06 18:44:00 Strange how the world isnt getting all over this story. Does Cameroon have any oil?
2943 2018-08-06 18:43:39 i’m so genuinely content with myself. i wake up every morning and look in the mirror and believe that i’m beautiful. i’ve stopped using bio oil for stretch marks because i’ve realized they are normal, and should not have to be taken away.
2944 2018-08-06 18:43:32 Stop importing Saudi Arabia oil and build energy east pipeline. Seems to me we have plenty of our in our own country.
2945 2018-08-06 18:43:10 From our oil sands in Alberta and offshore New Foundland.
2946 2018-08-06 18:43:10 The van you drive to your meetings does more damage each day than that oil does.
2947 2018-08-06 18:43:01 best commercial stuff is Aveeno, Jergens shea moisture or Nivea. Essential oils: tea tree oil or almond oil
2948 2018-08-06 18:42:46 The EU all together is similar, and is becoming more culturally diverse as well.
2949 2018-08-06 18:42:41 Me, painting with oil paint after 10 years:  I love this!  Why did I ever quit it?

2952 2018-08-06 18:42:36 Currently getting all up in Castor Oil and other essential oils... they have so many good properties!!!  Like... oil me up!!!  haha
2953 2018-08-06 18:42:28 WHAT OIL CHANGE PLACE CAN YOU JUST PULL UP ON? I FORGOT THE NAME
2954 2018-08-06 18:42:27 Peppermint oil, tea tree or avocado oil.  You can do hot oil treatments with them. It helps with dryness/itching & shedding for me.
2955 2018-08-06 18:42:23 Everything is good but oh Jesus them cheeseeggs. Something about the butterflavor ultra-bad-for-your-ass oil they use and the cheese just makes this insane umami ass thing go off in your mouth I'd kill for it I'll die for it I'll die from it
2956 2018-08-06 18:42:07 I've five insect bites in a row on my back where I cannot reach them and they are driving me MAD with their itching! Thank god for Ibroprufen pain killing gel and copious amounts lavender oil and my family to administer them. #Day4
2957 2018-08-06 18:42:06 key word "WAS" now it is just to satisfy #Putin who does not want oil competition from #Iran

2961 2018-08-06 18:41:26 What about states with refineries? When I lived in Louisiana, the claim there was that our gasoline was cheaper because so much oil is refined there. Proximity?
2962 2018-08-06 18:41:22 Canada doesn't depend on their oil. Or at least we shouldn't. Alberta has more oil than Saudi Arabia. If we only had a pipeline ...
@jkenney
2963 2018-08-06 18:41:22 Tyler Mathisen on @CNBC says oil at $100/bbr will be a 50% increase..
It's currently l at $70/bbr ... These guys are suppose to be good with numbers..?? 
Tyler must be a #tRump republican @cspanwj

2972 2018-08-06 18:40:59 Now, about that oil we buy from them... How's Energy East going?
2973 2018-08-06 18:40:59 Basic economics: Not buying from China may hurt China, but not selling our commodities and products to China will hurt ourselves. China can easily buy "coal, oil, and gas" from many other willing countries. In terms of "timber", the US has already slapped a high tariff on Cdn 1/2

3005 2018-08-06 18:38:02 This is just Aberdeen after the oil went away.
3006 2018-08-06 18:38:00 38. Let's consider a natural example, Nigeria has oil buried in d depth of many of it's rivers what is kept in d depth cannot be accessed until exploration which is drilling & searching is done, once d location is sure a pipe is sent down & under pressure d oil comes to d surface
3007 2018-08-06 18:38:00 Mmmm, delicious snake oil.

3014 2018-08-06 18:37:06 Haha najua Mahewa ni Fuso. Eeerrrm...basi sijui. Maybe regular oil change coz of turbo
3015 2018-08-06 18:36:55 Military recruiters do not belong in our high schools. Military recruiters prey on poor and minority students with the illusion of a college education if the students participate in foreign wars for oil and repression of human rights. #OH75
3016 2018-08-06 18:36:40 Its just all about money. Without money no one would give a toss about saudis or any other arab oil country. When the oil runs out.......?
3017 2018-08-06 18:36:34 I remember I used to think that I wanted kids, then I started babysitting and all I want to do is use my uterus as a slingshot, build tunnels with my tubes, plant my ovaries in the desert, & scramble my eggs in coconut oil. The kids in my family are fucking terrible.
3018 2018-08-06 18:36:33 My pores get clogged way too easily for that hahah coconut oil makes a mess out of my skin, I don’t use it for anything anymore
3019 2018-08-06 18:36:32 The blue springs lake is not what I remembered as a teen . 
Baby oil, pack of smokes and a raft.
Now, covered in goose poop and sand nothing like the BEACH!! Kids had fun, so that's all that matters...I guess, it was gross. 
3020 2018-08-06 18:36:31 You're both crazy hot, don't fight

Unless it's a pillow fight or oil wrestling, in which case: be my guest 
3021 2018-08-06 18:36:28 to bad ontario or quebec did not have some oil... i bet that would solve all our problems...
3022 2018-08-06 18:36:27 Well, it would be inconvenient but there are other countries with oil besides US and KSA.  These other oil producers aren’t our friends and don’t represent our values, but neither does the orange menace or MBS.
3023 2018-08-06 18:36:24 Preach! Mother Jenkins and pastor Washington gonna be at your door with blessed oil. Keep it up
3024 2018-08-06 18:36:13 co-sign: zaxbys was complete trash. the fries didn’t taste like anything. the onion rings tasted only of oil.

3027 2018-08-06 18:35:55 serious question to all reading this:  isn't some of what he has done fraud?  Can't you be charged criminally for this and spend time in jail?
Even if it is just with the snake oil he sells?
3028 2018-08-06 18:35:50 The bottom line is, Saudi Arabi is not a country to do business with. The have nothing we need and their human rights record is deplorable. Yet we have, oil, natural gas, uranium, nickle, iron ore, copper, timber, abundance of fresh water, vast farm land, on and on.
3029 2018-08-06 18:35:44 Very shallow,from the construction of the choice of vocabs,after studying the letter,I came to conclusion that someone conversant with twitter wrote it .
3030 2018-08-06 18:35:43 I don’t know I didn’t make it BUT it was made with homegrown tomatoes and was yummy! I’ve logged 3 syns for olive oil and 2 for “general”
3031 2018-08-06 18:35:43 Cuz it tastes like shit 
Which is weird cuz I like eggs and I like oil so you’d think I’d like mayonnaise
3032 2018-08-06 18:35:41 Getting ready for winter  one new oil boiler fitted. One gas boiler relocated for an extension. #winteriscoming 
3033 2018-08-06 18:35:20 Toh bani akant dinka in ma wani abu da kaniya
3034 2018-08-06 18:35:14 That would probably work great for some people but my skin gets worse with tea tree oil, unfortunately 
3035 2018-08-06 18:34:57 Juzi I smelled crude oil fresh from turkana it smells like kiwi, when dry you can even think its kiwi
3036 2018-08-06 18:34:57 If they wont oil me then no 
3037 2018-08-06 18:34:52 This is the longest I’ve gone without needing an oil change since I’ve owned my car. I legitimately thought my sensor was broken. Cut back my driving so much. I’m proud of myself 
3038 2018-08-06 18:34:40 You finally got your wish, Alex. The globalists are after you. Time to drop all those fancy clothes, rollexes and other luxuries and trully go rogue, like a true guerrilla revolutionary, someone who's not a snake oil salesman, actually would.
3039 2018-08-06 18:34:30 So yea I found out that if you dab some olive oil on it’ll take away the effects! Lmao
3040 2018-08-06 18:34:20 Hey POTUS!
What about the snow pack that doesn't happen anymore? 
What about the methane escaping oil rigs in New Mexico Texas and Northern Mexico? Why is that allowed to happen? 
Where's the Fast Federal govt. approvals to capture methane?
3041 2018-08-06 18:34:19 Meh. They cook everything in peanut oil. 
3042 2018-08-06 18:34:18 Kebanyakan kan gue pakenya sama grapseed oil juga
3043 2018-08-06 18:34:11 Damn dude, how long does it take to get an oil change? I’ve been waiting for over an hour now!
3044 2018-08-06 18:34:04 feeling like a big kid  getting my oil changed by myself for the first time
3045 2018-08-06 18:33:59 334
3046 2018-08-06 18:33:56 •argan oil 
•castor oil; hair growth (get them eyebrows thiccc hun)
•coconut oil; growth (nails,hair, not height)
•African black soap; skin (dark spots, stretch marks, pimples cellulite etc.)
3047 2018-08-06 18:33:54 Them go use oil chemical eraser to do d oil cleanup
3048 2018-08-06 18:33:53 They import their oil needs.
3049 2018-08-06 18:33:48 boomer: 10000 ft lateral producing 30K barrels a month, not 1000 ft lateral disrupted by gas problem, no oil & shut in.  Maybe one day!
3050 2018-08-06 18:33:47 It's not that big of a concern. Just ya know, keep in mind how old any kind of oil you have sitting on the shelf is.
3051 2018-08-06 18:33:44 The types of trade trump want for a deal with kenya are oil & gas & other mineral resources since he is direct involve on mineral trade.
3052 2018-08-06 18:33:44 Cannabis oil for dogs who have fits...check it out on YouTube
3053 2018-08-06 18:33:42 Sorry kids I know you like food but last months Accent needed an oil change so we just got a new one.
3054 2018-08-06 18:33:40 The worst? Worse than oil companies destroying the planet, worse than rapists, worse than pedophiles, worse than the USA starting wars and interfering in other countries for corporate interests? All of which  are male invented problems but it is white women that are the worst?
3055 2018-08-06 18:33:39 The trading relationship is more in Saudi Arabia's favour and most of the Saudi oil imports could easily be replaced if it came to it. I doubt that there'd be a Canadian other than the Irvings who would much object to that. Just saying...
3056 2018-08-06 18:33:36 Back to work today with a castor oil pack treatment.
3057 2018-08-06 18:33:35 Rand Paul, in Moscow, invites Russian lawmakers to Washington:WHAT DOES THIS CROOKED LIL' SNOT RANDY DANDY POLLAY WANNA CWACKA "OIL" DADA'S BOY GUT HIS PHUK'N NOSE STUCK IN IT FOR ?? DON'T TELL ME HE'S A TREASONOUS LARDAZZ DICK-LIKKA TOO !~!!!!@!@!@#~@

3059 2018-08-06 18:33:11 Use both methods and see what works for you. Check your shampoos too..some shampoos are drying. Coconut oil dries my hair...if you using it..stop using it and see if there is a difference
3060 2018-08-06 18:32:58 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
3061 2018-08-06 18:32:48 medium chain fatty acids. They’re types of fat most often derived from coconut oil. Helps burn fat, boost energy and brain function. I've been taking it combined with a high fat diet and its helped alot
3062 2018-08-06 18:32:43  Where shall we go this week folks .....?
The BLUE MONDAY is back chipotle marinated sirloin steak and Gorgonzola DOP, garlic and truffle oil.
3063 2018-08-06 18:32:30 Very lame and it's really making Prof Hafiz a victim.

"Go back to the university, that's where you're comfortable." That's really shallow if you asked me.
3064 2018-08-06 18:32:26 >so no, I don't read reports about North Sea oil which are based on myth when I see people in my neighbourhood stressed because they have lost their jobs in the industry. my boss was retired last month due to council cuts, so I don't have hope in Yes. end
3065 2018-08-06 18:32:24 No to mention that his whole operation is to basically peddle snake oil and bone broth.
3066 2018-08-06 18:32:10 $CL_F there’s that $1 move oil loves to do... beautiful
3067 2018-08-06 18:32:10 I’m really shocked because my mom bought this essential oil stuff for allergies and it really had my hives clear up. I ran out of my medicine today so I had to sub. Benadryl never works so I’m always trying to find cheaper alternatives until I can buy more.

3069 2018-08-06 18:31:51 Tell me why we have mad canola oil luckily lol
3070 2018-08-06 18:31:48 Next time just say change the oil and I'll leave the rest to the pros
3071 2018-08-06 18:31:45 Yes! Let's live in a country where only the super rich can get medical care and educate their kids! Yay! Let's live in a country with no living wage! Let's live in a country where oil & gas companies take over all of our national monuments and wildlife preserves! #winning
3072 2018-08-06 18:31:25 The trans mountain pipeline was for oil export! Makes no sense at all when a pipeline to the east would help make Canada independent of oil imports. #cdnpoli @JustinTrudeau
3073 2018-08-06 18:31:24 So there will be opportunities for other signatories to purchase Iranian oil at reduced prices and sell them many of the products America won’t at inflated prices - capitalism in action
3074 2018-08-06 18:31:19 One thing that is clear is that Saudi Arabia understands Canada’s psychological blind spots. Its leaders know the Trudeau government is very unlikely to retaliate against their oil exports because that would mean removal of barriers to Alberta’s oil industry. #abpoli #cdnpoli
3075 2018-08-06 18:31:14 LOL! You think we can't get oil elsewhere? You're kidding yourself. We're also using less oil and more renewable resources in Canada. This will simply drive innovation.
3076 2018-08-06 18:31:08 I really need to learn how to change my own oil bc this waiting at Walmart for 2 hours is getting old.
3077 2018-08-06 18:31:06 Bro never take your car to those quick oil change places they are scams and they always destroy something
3078 2018-08-06 18:31:03 寝ろ
3079 2018-08-06 18:31:02 But, we will still purchase hundreds of thousands of BBLs of oil daily from the Saudis, because that’s still less offensive to Quebec than Alberta oil...

#EnergyEast
3080 2018-08-06 18:30:53 Actions speak louder than words, Jason. And right now Notley’s actions speak loud and clear that she and the ABNDP have the best interests of all Albertans in mind. Not just oil companies and a few religious special interests
3081 2018-08-06 18:30:40 Auntie Jackie'sLeave in conditioners..."Knot on my watch" or "quench my thirst". Apply the conditioner first, then your moisturiser/cream, then the oils. Some uses leave in conditioner, then oil, then cream/mosturiser.
3082 2018-08-06 18:30:36 There is something a little exciting about seeing your man covered in motor oil O///0
3083 2018-08-06 18:30:34 Do people really believe these tiny companies in the oil and mining sectors that claim to have revolutionary technology yet have been unable to make it profitable! Surely if they had something that was actually any good a big player would snap it up straight away!
3084 2018-08-06 18:30:32 Hey trump supporters, Iranian sanctions kicking in and experts say OIL will go up to $90 bucks a barrel. That means HIGHER pump prices! Already up .80 cents a gallon since trump took office so look for that to double! So much winning! LOL! trump supporters, he's all your's!
3085 2018-08-06 18:30:32 It might be nice too if Canada bought its oil from Alberta instead of Saudi Arabia.

3087 2018-08-06 18:30:27 So as I’m sitting in the lobby at the dealership waiting for them to finish my oil change, I realize I’m listening to I Prevail and I’m mouthing every word. Now I get why the others waiting are looking at me like I’m crazy 
3088 2018-08-06 18:30:26 Aside from the fact that oil is not mineral one can see the attempted spin

3091 2018-08-06 18:30:23 Include flaxseed in your diet , chew raw or crush and include in yogurt, sprinkle over salads etc. At least 2tsp a day. Also get flaxseed oil from a chemist, slightly warm and rub through your hair as a treatment,  twice a week. Try and include Raw honey in your diet as well.
3092 2018-08-06 18:30:09 You should drive an oil truck thats like the modern day milk man if you get my drift!!!
3093 2018-08-06 18:30:00 stuffing my chair full of oil.
3094 2018-08-06 18:29:48 You’re welcome!! You should be cool. I used a tea tree conditioner and couple drops of tea tree oil and it was so bomb.
3095 2018-08-06 18:29:40 What would these Iranians do if they didn't have oil. Less terrorism in the world.
3096 2018-08-06 18:29:39 It should say government unions. About half of Oil Sands developments' infrastructure was built by unionized labour. Electricians, gas fitters, welders, plumbers, etc. Didn't stop the NDP or the Liberals from doing everything they could to shut it down.
3097 2018-08-06 18:29:36 Hummm, where on earth could eastern Canada find an replacement supply for $2.3 billion of Saudi oil? Maybe Antarctica? It's too bad that Canada does not generate it's own oil... oh wait.
3098 2018-08-06 18:29:36 Saudi Arabia produces 3 time more oil than we do, makes sense to me, Brett but even these dumbos recognize which country is strong and which is weak (Trudeau is a weakling with no ethics about how he wins votes)
3099 2018-08-06 18:29:29 Having a new car is cool until you have to pay $100 for an oil change lol... and then people ask why it’s so expensive.... cause you drive a Honda that takes 0w20 lol ... you want a $19.99 oil change buy a 99’ Honda Civic 
3100 2018-08-06 18:29:08 Need 2 be seriously investigated Plenty info out there!
Insane greed BS PRSelling world a bill o' goods & snake oil!
So much to hide they come up downright dirty in globalist world destruction  #BillGates #Depopulation #toxic#vaccines#GMO #Ecocide #Refuge #Crisis
3101 2018-08-06 18:29:07 It's expensive but the True Botanicals face oil is pretty amazing
3102 2018-08-06 18:28:50 Clearly you do not understand the science of  pot+full+of+cooking+oil 101
3103 2018-08-06 18:28:42 By "close friends" with US... You mean a protected vassal state which exchanges valuable oil for pieces of paper.
3104 2018-08-06 18:28:39 I don’t have chapstick so my coworker gave me coconut oil. WOW.
3105 2018-08-06 18:28:37 China and Europe refused USA sanctions on Iran .so oil prices will down to 55-60$  very soon لا اعتقد الأسعار صاعده لان الصين واوربا رفضت تطبيق العقوبات وايضا روسيا  والسعوديه تضخ كميات كبيره من النفط لذلك ستنزل والله العالم
3106 2018-08-06 18:28:32 If a conspiracy theorist/snake oil salesman screams his head off on the internet and nobody is there to hear it because he's been excised from social media and streaming platforms, does he make a sound? 

We're about to find out, but at least we know it'll be a lot more peaceful.
3107 2018-08-06 18:28:29 Yeh it's not a reality now , they still need oil now the whole world still need it , it will take a lot of time till they get to tge point where they totally don't use oil a long long time ;)
3108 2018-08-06 18:28:28 South Dakota has no income tax and no oil.
3109 2018-08-06 18:28:28 What’s a “whack job” & how does one define a “whack job”? Is a whack job a Christian, acc to an atheist? Is a whack job an anti-war activist, acc to the establishment? Is a whack job an oil worker, acc to an environmentalist?

Website: It smells good too!
Me: are you joking mE?

Like what? The stuff smells horriBLE
3117 2018-08-06 18:27:53 i know eh they really hate the Conservatives and will go down  defending Trudeau to try and make him look good and it's oil not minerals
3118 2018-08-06 18:27:50 Biggest producer of terror and we fund it by buying their oil. Shame on all the so called environmentalists who take great pride in blocking pipelines in Canada. They only help Saudi!’n
3119 2018-08-06 18:27:50 Baby oil and iodine was the way to go at Tar Beach!!
3120 2018-08-06 18:27:37 Drenched in coconut oil 
3121 2018-08-06 18:27:25 It’s my personal favorite when I take my car for an oil change & they bring in my dirty ass air filter with leaves & dirt falling out of it & ask in front of everyone if you want them to change it out. Like nah. Shake that shit out & call it a day sir.
3122 2018-08-06 18:27:21 APC is Not the problem of Nigeria, leave the innocent broom alone, all these politicians using the broom and umbrellas and switching owners are the real problem! Obun is talking oil prices

3125 2018-08-06 18:27:01 How long should an oil change take when my car pulls directly into the bay @jiffylube on avg?

3127 2018-08-06 18:26:36 I'm sorry we forgot your oil and vinegar! Forgive me?
3128 2018-08-06 18:26:21 As we should. I'd rather have a more stable revenue base than simply being dependent on oil tax revenues.
3129 2018-08-06 18:26:12 To anyone who is in physical pain or know someone that is I highly recommend taking black seed oil. I’m about a month and a half into an ACL surgery and I’m already climbing mountains with no problems 
3130 2018-08-06 18:26:10 Lol wrong account that I have received payment twice
3131 2018-08-06 18:25:58 Mind you, they didn’t have any oil to take I suppose 
3132 2018-08-06 18:25:54 It’s time consuming, but slice it and dehydrate it on a rack in a 250 degee oven for about 30 minutes. Then toss in olive oil, salt and pepper and roast in a 425 degree oven until brown and crispy. So good.
3133 2018-08-06 18:25:33 I was flabbergasted actually, coming from a Doctor,and someone I so much respect, its utterly ridiculous and unbefitting, I'm sure his incompetent Sa's suggested that nursery school rejoinder .
3134 2018-08-06 18:25:29 We buy millions of barrels of Saudi oil each day.  Plus, we have lucrative arms deals with them.  We’ve been pumping aid into Palestine for as long as I can remember.  If we’re serious about human rights, maybe should step back from these arrangements, non?

3136 2018-08-06 18:25:24 China and Europe refused USA sanctions on Iran .so oil prices will down to 55-60$  very soon
3137 2018-08-06 18:25:19 When having braids , this is when I need a “at home boyfriend” so that he can oil my scalp when I don’t feel like it 
3138 2018-08-06 18:25:03 Just took it to Auto Zone. Code that is coming up says “Speed Censor No Signal”. Is this something that the people who did Oil Change/Engine Flush couldve messed up?
3139 2018-08-06 18:24:49 As oil money dries up, they just might. Except there'll be more desperate  people this time.  Sigh.
3140 2018-08-06 18:24:47 me getting my teeth cleaned: this sounds so good is this from oil of every pearl's un-insides
3141 2018-08-06 18:24:34 I agree. The oil companies would most likely look for federal dollars to get it done
3142 2018-08-06 18:24:33 How long is an oil change supposed to take cuz an hour and a half HAS to be fucking wrong bro
3143 2018-08-06 18:24:27 I was taken by surprise today when a young lady changed the oil in my car. It was pretty hot

3147 2018-08-06 18:24:09 And in case you haven't noticed, it's ALWAYS about taking some else's natural resource, particularly when it's OIL.  This is always the GOP'S M.O.  They're SO predictable. And they're gung ho to start a war over it.  SO patriotic!
3148 2018-08-06 18:24:03 Remind me again why we are buying oil from Saudi Arabia? An arrack on Canada is an attack on America
3149 2018-08-06 18:24:03 How do we stop these horrid roundups ? The BLM needs to b exposed to the public for the REAL reasons they're being removed . Making room for ranching and Oil drilling .
This will eventually come back to bite us all as the water & land are destroyed 
Forever & not from the horses
3150 2018-08-06 18:23:51 Unfortunately ,Essential Oil 101 has been cancelled for this evening. Please join us next month!
3151 2018-08-06 18:23:42 It's a French comoany, I think. I've installed them in my cars before (oil and diesel) without problem.
3152 2018-08-06 18:23:31 If Canada takes it's oil from Barry's favorite place to give planeloads of cash to, that just strengthens the cabal behind those people?
3153 2018-08-06 18:23:26 I have the tee tree oil that’s meant for a diffuser but I didn’t get the diffuser lmfao but now I might!! What’re your fav oils?
3154 2018-08-06 18:23:23 Malan how will I expect good,when fr 2 good months they've not paid me
3155 2018-08-06 18:23:19 InfoWars is NOT the press lol, it's a snake oil shopping channel, nothing more
3156 2018-08-06 18:23:10 reclaim is the way to go, especially when you're out of oil. why not? still gets me high
3157 2018-08-06 18:23:05 what happened w mine is that it would just, like… feel like it never dried completely. i don’t use a blowdryer so the underside would go from wet to oil no matter how thoroughly i washed it. disgusting
3158 2018-08-06 18:23:03 Foreign investors decry high charges in oil and gas free zones
3159 2018-08-06 18:23:03 China’s Gas Tariffs Are a Permian-Size Problem for Oil #bloomberg
3160 2018-08-06 18:22:50 if you need an oil change then new @Valvoline next to the new food city on sunset is AMAZING! I highly recommend!
3161 2018-08-06 18:22:50 It’s illegal to sell suntan oil until after noon on Sunday. (Provincetown, Massachusetts)
3162 2018-08-06 18:22:35 Good news - and it's about time, I wrote and advocated for that in Olive Oil Times some years ago.
3163 2018-08-06 18:22:33 Good. Be careful with that oil. It’s a hot oil and can burn your skin
3164 2018-08-06 18:22:17  Drilling for oil is boring.
3165 2018-08-06 18:22:15 Not for money. Not for oil!
3166 2018-08-06 18:22:09 Do your research first please, before you make these malicious allegations about #UKOG. I’m sick to death of you idiots trying to put down a company for trying to create jobs and prosperity in the Weald basin, and for us not to rely on imports of oil from other countries.
3167 2018-08-06 18:22:01 Cat Mange-Veg. Oil dip- 
Get vegetable oil and warm, use clean rag or dip cat, head to tail,thoroughly. Leave on for 1 hour. Rinse repeat up to 3 times weekly as needed.

3169 2018-08-06 18:21:52 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4 Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3170 2018-08-06 18:21:39 (By "soak" I mean sprinkle the inside of the cuff with 20 or so drops of tea tree oil, and rub it into the leather.  Add more if needed.)
3171 2018-08-06 18:21:36 Let’s see if we stop importing their oil?  @EnergyEast
3172 2018-08-06 18:21:22 Cat Mange- Home remedy- (ONLY IF CANT PAY VET) Mix Apple cider vinegar with warm water( half n half) and use clean rag, wipe all over saturating cats fur, leave on for 3-4 hours rinse. Repeat until clear. You can alternate dips between Apple cider vinegar dip ^^ and Veg oil dip

3174 2018-08-06 18:21:06 Why aren’t you asking Linklater to get fully behind Independence for Scotland? There is only 1 way immigration, Trident, Fracking, Brand Scotland, Oil Revenues SNHS etc can be solved. Independence. Why are you foutering with only 1 issue? They’re all interlinked with 1 solution.
3175 2018-08-06 18:20:52 Inadvertently, this report exposes the real problem: a US government allied with the ultra right wing in Miami and Bogota determined to impose austerity and a collapse the economy in exchange for an easy and guaranteed access to the oil resources of Venezuela.
3176 2018-08-06 18:20:48 Whoa whoa whoa...I just used waste engine oil. Lasts forever, has a very nice smell of burnt diesel.

3179 2018-08-06 18:20:25 That was Qatar and Turkey including Hizib Allah and Iran .. Saudi has oil and gas .. what the fuck does it need to take over Syria pipeline projects ? It’s business and Saudi didn’t involved ..
3180 2018-08-06 18:20:17 On Air Force One, Jared Kushner carefully explains to President Trump that the Feds are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Jeffrey Lord gets voted out.
3181 2018-08-06 18:20:08 When both numbers are small, times is a poor comparison. The most violent nations have homicide rates that are twenty to almost a hundred per hundred thousand. We are far closer to the other OECD nations.
3182 2018-08-06 18:19:57 "Sea-eagle's head. Mixed media: Oil on canvas with material collage. 2018. £6450." ?
3183 2018-08-06 18:19:57 Wait, is it even controversial that Venezuela’s Big Push ISI was financed by petrodollars? I don’t think it is. Perhaps nitpickers might say some particular political economy in Venezuela made this more likely than in Colombia if the latter had the same oil windfall.
3184 2018-08-06 18:19:54 Yeah if this should indeed show why it is needed. However most Canadian refineries in Eastern Canada would need millions of dollars of investment to be able to  refine the oil. Who pays or so we just export as was the original intent.
3185 2018-08-06 18:19:23 Are You hanging out with the human hybrids or gay frogs?

Popping Real Red Pills or mainlining the Krill Oil?
3186 2018-08-06 18:19:14 The smell of peppermint essential oil overwhelms ants and interferes with their ability to smell food, then they leave.  I put some in my kitchen and dishwasher and they are gone! #Oregon #AntAttack #winning #MicDrop
3187 2018-08-06 18:19:11 I give mine a good soak & rub with tea tree oil every so often.  A good dousing of Lysol should work, or rub it down with rubbing alcohol.  You might want to get the inside of the wallet too, the side closest to your skin.  Let it dry before you put it back on.

3190 2018-08-06 18:18:44 Name another OECD country that has the same land mass, population size, and diversity as the US. And Greg is right, many of the inter cities in the US are like 3rd world countries.
3191 2018-08-06 18:18:31 Coconut oil being claimed as use for everything is age-specific. And correlates to the YouTube rise of natural hair content. Ain’t nobody said that shit was an answer for everything back in the day.
3192 2018-08-06 18:18:23 Lmfao I Odeed on some oil and drank a whole bottle of Belaire on the same night smh woke up next morning drunk and angry thinking someone stole it 
3193 2018-08-06 18:18:19 Just got some different cbd oil that actually is tested through manufacturers and i got 300 mg and it works so much better than that that crap i bought the other day.  I got it from an actual distributor.
3194 2018-08-06 18:18:19  too bad HE didn't think more about oil than HE did scenery.
3195 2018-08-06 18:18:05 Growth

-

You should grow them out before anything (unless they're already thick) so you can have a full base to work w

-

use castor/coconut/or olive oil,vaseline,petroleum jelly,contact solution and leave on overnight/ few hours everyday.
3196 2018-08-06 18:18:04 I forwarded it to CSIS and CSIS middle east, the ontario RCMP, Canadian RCMP and to the Canadian military. Screw their threats. They have paid 0 consequences for 9/11 and feel brazen. I say cancel the contract and eat the fine regardless of amount. We don't need their oil either!
3197 2018-08-06 18:18:04 All lies bibi  money in treasury is loan one  foreign investment lowest  export lowest  foreign loans highest oil prices gone up world wide can u answer these 55 companies in Punjab what did these do how much funds used
3198 2018-08-06 18:17:58 Cannabis oil doesn’t get you high.
3199 2018-08-06 18:17:57 Kitten milk-(only if under 5 weeks and you CANNOT afford kitten R.M. ) Mix a can of evaporated milk( non sweetened), a egg yolk ( yolk only) 1 tbspn of Mayonnaise,(cod liver oil if u have it) with warm water and feed. 4 ml every 4 hours under 3 weeks. 7 ml 3 times if older.
3200 2018-08-06 18:17:45 The oil embargo 1973: OPEC countries were angry of Israel's occupation in Arabian countries, and so they decided to cut down on oil exports to USA(they were supporting Israel). This meant that Dd was high and Ss low, raising prices from $3 to about $11
3201 2018-08-06 18:17:39 As if their so called intelligence have no t briefed him. Those people with oil....

 In fact that may be the main agenda!
3202 2018-08-06 18:17:30 4-5 times higher is significant.
3203 2018-08-06 18:17:28 ok but also brocolli roasted in olive oil + salt and pepper (cumin seeds if you're feeling adventurous) will high key change your life and perception of brocolli
3204 2018-08-06 18:17:10 They are the same. How are they different? They both are owned by +represent the biggest of big money ..finance, bigpharma, silicon valley, las vegas, raytheon, boeing, GE, big oil, the israel lobby and saudi money. Do you see a difference in foreign policy? Treatment of workers?
3205 2018-08-06 18:17:00 Dear Saudi Arabia,
you can drink that fn oil for all I care.
3206 2018-08-06 18:16:57 Hey loo!

People of Iran are smart and capable enough to see the truth inside and out...including the dirty hands of meddling super powers who are thirsty for oil and war to sell their weapons killing millions of innocent middle eastern people..

3207 2018-08-06 18:16:56 that’s  why Tesla and Elon Must  is in trouble?
The oil boys are out to get it?
3208 2018-08-06 18:16:48 I think oil will stay where it is for next little while
3209 2018-08-06 18:16:44 I remember when @GoodallsIreland  Olive Oil came in little tiny bottles and was only used heated on a spoon to clear the wax from your ears! Never on a Salad!!!
3210 2018-08-06 18:16:42 "Lookin' fine, bro! Check it out, we both got scarves! Now that's stylin'!" (Oil Man, MM Powered Up)
3211 2018-08-06 18:16:41 But David is right, private companies buy oil, and federal or provincial policy really can't change that. Are you advocating for federal or provincial nationalization of oil companies?
3212 2018-08-06 18:16:31 I for one believe Nigeria would have been far better off without the discovery of oil, we would have blossomed beyond any doubt but hope is still not lost
3213 2018-08-06 18:16:17 In an obscure way it was about adoptions. The Republicans wud adopt Russian "dream list." Repeal Magnitsky Act, disband EU-NATO, and begin the "big oil" comeback,screw environment,invent a reason to start Iranian War-u know adopt the Kremlin Baby!
3214 2018-08-06 18:16:13 Ok but srly - when we're out of oil, which will likely happen in our lifetime, then what? Tyres are made of oil, plastics (i.e. car bodies) too. 

Caleches are green transport. Why ban them when you can hire better drivers?
#polmtl #mtlpoli
3215 2018-08-06 18:16:09 1- Precautions over 260 billion barrels
2- Very low production costs
3- The capacity to produce more than 12 million barrels per day
4- isn't just oil, it has natural gas, a lot of chemical industries, and soon it will take over SABIC

and a lots of other things...

it's a Giant
3216 2018-08-06 18:16:08 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3217 2018-08-06 18:16:08 Exactly my thought when I was reading the rejoinder. Where in the world did "I have appealed to them and they've obliged to drop it" comes from?

Very pathetic he could boast of his control of the HOA publicly.
3218 2018-08-06 18:15:59 In the 20 years you were a member before 1997 did that Labour Party ever win a GE? Did it lose four of them whilst Thatcher destroyed our industries, privatised our Gas, Electric, Water & squandered our social-housing stock & our oil revenues? Just wondering.
3219 2018-08-06 18:15:50 OIL --------------------------------> lost some luster when Iran said they're willing to meet w/President Trump
3220 2018-08-06 18:15:50 Why weren't you as vocal when the likes of Psg / City and all other oil tycoons manipulated the FFP rules with dodgy loan agreements, sponsorships etc?
3221 2018-08-06 18:15:45 minyak jelantah lebih sehat vi dibanding sesame oil wkwk...

3223 2018-08-06 18:15:29 RU gave $1.5 Billion to Venezuela Oil co who used Citgo as security if they default $1.5 Billion missing and laundered in Miami Real Estate from V oil co who will default Giving RU 50% of Citgo for free Senators gets paid so deal go through But FBI have diff plans LOL LOL LOL
3224 2018-08-06 18:15:26 that’s what you have to do when the saudi economy stands only on fading oil
3225 2018-08-06 18:15:23 last night when I was drunk I came home and put coconut oil in my hair & on my face (bacteria can't grow in coconut oil so it's good for skin) & now my pillow is oily & I'm a fucking moron
3226 2018-08-06 18:15:22 lmaoo anointing oil will burn you, spawn of satan
3227 2018-08-06 18:15:22 And we're not that far off from the other OECD nations. We are certainly far from the most violent countries.
3228 2018-08-06 18:15:12 We are a state that does not rely on one of you to export oil for your wishes
3229 2018-08-06 18:15:03 We need to oil our systems to continuously be on top of our game. Innovate your systems or you will be old & forgotten. #NatalieForest #revo
3230 2018-08-06 18:15:03 Maybe he can get on part time with Jim “Snake Oil” Bakker?
3231 2018-08-06 18:15:01 Did I get this right @BijanKK ? Rouhani speech
1. Only direct oil revenue at official rate (4200 toman) the rest of gov. fx revenue at open market rate. 
2. That open market was recently outlawed but is made legit again. 
3. CBI will guarantee bank deposits at xchange rate. 
1/1
3232 2018-08-06 18:14:56 I think it is time that Canada builds it's own refinneries , produce our own gas  rather then send it to the USA to be refinned ......see how Saudi swallows that one !  I think even Trump would be upset with that , considering we have the 3rd largest oil reserve in the world !
3233 2018-08-06 18:14:55 palm oil and pepper,infact things that are red

3235 2018-08-06 18:14:53 They use CBD oil not THC but it’s not even enough CBD to have an effect
3236 2018-08-06 18:14:52 Saudi has more to lose. Canada has oil. We don’t need anything from you.
3237 2018-08-06 18:14:47 Wild growth oil lol
3238 2018-08-06 18:14:45 Jamaican Castor oil is probably one of my most underrated purchases I’ve ever made. That stuff does wonders I tell you lol
3239 2018-08-06 18:14:42 The Magnitsky Act and Sanctions on Russian kleptocrats, oligarchs, banks and Industries (Oil and Gas) are two different things.

Ask @Billbrowder how much Putin hates the Magnitsky Act. It prevents him from moving all the money he steals from hard working Russians offshore.
3240 2018-08-06 18:14:33 Selling snake oil as a cure all started in the late 1800's.  Scam's are an american tradition.  Baseball, apple pies, scams and so on.
3241 2018-08-06 18:14:19 a day that included putting my first grey cannula in and spending an afternoon discussing oil:gas partition coefficients - #livingthedream #anaesthetics @ImpAnaesthesia
3242 2018-08-06 18:14:07 Our very own Prime Minister of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, was a neurosurgeon in Saudi Arabia in Dhahran. Once your country is out of oil, it's going to be a sand hole with absolutely nothing but veiled women who can't get out of their hut without a man.
3243 2018-08-06 18:14:06 I apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Argan Oil once a week, u can find them at dis-chem pharmacy's
3244 2018-08-06 18:14:06 Like someone comes in for an oil change but is leaking coolant everywhere and then try’s to say it wasn’t doing that before the oil change 
3245 2018-08-06 18:14:03 People are free to buy snake oil. People are free to sell snake oil.
People are free to listen, and do their own research. Unless someone thinks they are too stupid to have freedoms. Are you too stupid to have freedoms?
3246 2018-08-06 18:14:02 The Venezuela murder rate is much higher than the US and I didn't say it was an equal to the US. In fact, none of the OECD countries are equal to the US with land mass, population size, and diversity. On top of that, there is no correlation of murder rates and gun ownership.
3247 2018-08-06 18:13:59 And to protect oil. Hmmm, #oil. We love it, don't we.
3248 2018-08-06 18:13:53 I apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Argan Oil once a week, u can find them at dis-chem pharmacy's
3249 2018-08-06 18:13:43 Free speech is essential but deliberate abuse to belittle & demonise Muslims who own oil & gas & land which heavily armed nations want to steal, by dint of that same demonisation, is as vile as it is evil. 
Apologists for demonisation of any race/religion have no place on my tl.
3250 2018-08-06 18:13:40 Can’t retweet your tweet so here goes - we will never use our own oil because it is dirty, might soil our sewage choked rivers and because it from Alberta

3254 2018-08-06 18:13:25 Simple solution, just stop sending oil to the liberal cities. See how many hours it takes them to start crying 
3255 2018-08-06 18:13:20 Not exactly ‘local’ but there’s plenty of them. Halfords, as much as it pains me, but I do an oil change every other track day and filter every four. It’s rare you’ll find cheaper than them and they sell good quality stuff.
3256 2018-08-06 18:13:13 MCT oil and coffee always gets my bowels going
3257 2018-08-06 18:12:55 i like to spray a little bit of cooking oil on them and then season the fuck out of them with garlic powder, onion powder, and chilli powder and then i bake them until the sogginess has been evaporated and the oil helps the outside stay crispy i think idk fukken works tho lol

3261 2018-08-06 18:12:29 Jamaican black castor oil.
3262 2018-08-06 18:12:26 Maybe, but imagine the worth of the last drop of oil.  It will probably be worthless because something better has taken its place.
3263 2018-08-06 18:12:24 I understand that this everybody loves Saudi Arabia and Israel but come on seriously. Come nvmbr sanctions will be impose on other countries also,all this just to make Israelees & Saudies in charge of middle east.we hav oil,bring the boys/girls back home & get out of their
3264 2018-08-06 18:12:20 most of the hijackers saudi. 15 out of the 19 who made it onto a flight were saudi nationals. we've never punished them because...oil & $$.
3265 2018-08-06 18:12:12  what oil lol
3266 2018-08-06 18:12:06 Word? Bet. RT @crym89s: That’s a fact. I barely grew facial hair before I started using that oil lol
3267 2018-08-06 18:12:03 I know some of the paint brushes would start lagging, especially at larger sizes with a few layers. Smooth watercolor and oil, perhaps?
3268 2018-08-06 18:11:54 Brad, I’ve heard we have a lot of oil in western Canada.  

Is that true, and if so is there some way we could ship it east to displace imports from Saudi?
3269 2018-08-06 18:11:33 Coconut oil last longer on my skin than lotion do. And I be soft as hell

3271 2018-08-06 18:11:24 I want huge oil paintings with these scenarios, I want so see them in a gallery or museum hall and each shall be labled with a small plate with one of Mr. Pong's messages.
3272 2018-08-06 18:11:08 About to be a certified oil rigs guy!!!
3273 2018-08-06 18:11:01 If we are the largest oil producer then why am I paying $3.29 a gallon of gas? A year ago I paid $2.24.

3277 2018-08-06 18:10:29 It’s stupid to think that Canada get its oil from Saudi Arabia.
3278 2018-08-06 18:10:24 The notion that we can build up "alternatives" before tearing down oil supply is a form of denial common to climate scientists as well as oil company supplicants. What climate scientists have in common with oil company executives is how I differ from them.

3283 2018-08-06 18:09:50 This is an oil painting i did earlier this year. It's  a scenery of a place outside of Davis,WV at the hunting club. 

Medium: oil on canvas
Dimension: 30" x 30"
Artist: april knotts
3284 2018-08-06 18:09:49 These numbers are published online by the World Bank, SA itself, Wikipedia, etc. These were figures from 2014. SA is a country on its way to developing an economy outside of the oil rent but it is not so easy to do it so fast and without a great work experience in the population.
3285 2018-08-06 18:09:38 Truffle oil sells for 1100 gold.

3288 2018-08-06 18:09:11 Had an AgBag machine.  I checked the right angle box oil thinking it was one with the planetary because I didn't see another plug. 

$45k later it was running again.
3289 2018-08-06 18:09:01 amergeet sohi, MP from MILLWOODS ( EDMONTON ALBERTA ) VOTED IN FAVOR OF PURCHASING OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA THAT PRODUCING ALBERTA OIL NEVER VOTE FOR THIS TWO FACED NON CANDIAN IN ANY ELECTION !!!
3290 2018-08-06 18:08:59 Maybe if we had a environmentally safe pipeline we could bring oil to the east coast cheaper than offshore oil, keep investment in Canada, provide good Canadian jobs, reduce carbon from train movements...but that would make common sense which is against current thinking.
3291 2018-08-06 18:08:40 You really cannot believe that all of these things are happening. If you do, you need to start doing some serious listening to ppl in Trump’s cabinet. N. Korea is not denuked, ISIS is not defeated, if we are the world’s largest oil producer then explain high gas prices. Wake up!
3292 2018-08-06 18:08:38 Idk if it’s the castor oil or her riding my face but my goatee is flourishing
3293 2018-08-06 18:08:32 And yet, ND (with much larger oil production) still imposes a state income tax and a state sales tax on its residents.
3294 2018-08-06 18:08:26 

Couldn't pay employed civil servants for a year after employment? How much was Akwa ibom receiving from FAAC? Highest earners in Nigeria! 

@NOIweala spoke he was part of the governor's that kicked against saving money during oil boom.
3295 2018-08-06 18:08:17 Thank you  
I normally use Olive oil, this version turned out much better.

3296 2018-08-06 18:08:15 The concoction of body odours in this carriage is tremendous. My sinuses are an oil rich nation and the smell is America attempting to "liberate" it.
3297 2018-08-06 18:08:09 World's supergiant oil fields (Cantarell, Samotlor, Burgan) are in decline, Ghawar is the largest. What if the Ghawar stopped meeting the demand after next year?
3298 2018-08-06 18:08:07 Probably a good reason oil was never discovered in Pakistan till now 
#AsifAliZardairAndShareefChor
3299 2018-08-06 18:08:05 Ha! Free trade encourages long-distance shipping (more oil consumption & pollution), destroys local sustainable production by driving a “race to the bottom”, encourages pollution shifting, and privileges huge corporations over small businesses/cooperatives/communities.

3301 2018-08-06 18:08:00 It's moving in that direction.  Think of all the CA people and businesses transplanted to TX.  It has an impact.  
Go @BetoORourke ! :)
3302 2018-08-06 18:07:39 Strange that they dont mention CO2EOR or staggering cost of solar EOR. Discussion on facts mentioned are also wrong as the figures are based on non GCC oil extraction %..Is higher in Saudi or UAE..also most threats can't be countered by solar eor!
3303 2018-08-06 18:07:35 I put olive oil??? mate, im gonna see a pharmacist, you’re right
3304 2018-08-06 18:07:32 RT Followed all or Following please follow back
3305 2018-08-06 18:07:30 Pathetic Ill-informed idiots desperately and falsely making up statements with no scientific substance or basic common sense. Long live #UKOG the quicker oil is pumped out the better, and BTW it’s naturally fractured not mechanically- as Mother Nature intended.
3306 2018-08-06 18:07:27 By the way,  I've been out here flourishing in my dry body oil and gold shimmer
3307 2018-08-06 18:07:22 Same for a tax. Oil companies don't HAVE to develop a given piece of land in any particular state. If the state takes too much in taxes, they'll go somewhere else to get the oil.

3311 2018-08-06 18:06:52 Climate change will visit hell on earth but short term profits for the criminals who remove pollution controls, who fill our seas with oil and plastic, who pump carbon into the atmosphere is all that matters. These are crimes against the planet.

3313 2018-08-06 18:06:48 どぴゅにゃんこ
3314 2018-08-06 18:06:42 actually we have only recently passed Saudi Arabia & for as much as we produce we don`t use nearly half our stock cause it goes into reserve besides, before he stole the election he said he wanted Iran`s oil
3315 2018-08-06 18:06:41 Oh she also said if you take the pill form take it with a meal that has a higher fat content cause fat/oil helps the body absorb it better. The drops have something in them that help with the absorption.
3316 2018-08-06 18:06:40 Some guy just came into the shop hammered as hell and said his wife’s car needs an oil change. He was driving a Tesla. It’s 1pm on a Monday.
3317 2018-08-06 18:06:40 Policy. If you can explain how opening up the entire eastern seaboard for oil drilling, or enacting a trade war to prop up industry's because they voted for him is good policy then I'd love to hear it. But clearly your enjoying the Trump show.
3318 2018-08-06 18:06:39 wow this oil and lotion massage followed by the hot towel>>>
3319 2018-08-06 18:06:38 I’m sitting at a car place getting my oil changed and this kid is rolling around on a chair pretending he’s swimming.
3320 2018-08-06 18:06:38 .@planetmoney I'm a big fan of the show BUT I have hated the episodes on Venezuela for their simplistic take on the Venezuelan crisis. Starting episode #858 with "when oil prices tanked a couple of years ago... Venezuela ran out of money" is unacceptable.
3321 2018-08-06 18:06:15 We are net oil exporters. About 10-13% of the oil we import comes from Saudi Arabia. With the reversal of Line 9, the refineries in Quebec are less dependent on foreign oil, so we're talking just refineries in NL and NB at this point - and they would certainly have options.

3323 2018-08-06 18:05:49 keep flirting like that & you'll be checking his oil soon
3324 2018-08-06 18:05:48 Google: Bin Laden family. They have a very close relationship with the Saudi royal family. Intertwined.
Trump has a close relationship with King Salman and the royal family of Saudi Arabia. He is in cahoots with them. It's all about oil and tRumps pockets. I can't fill the Chevy.
3325 2018-08-06 18:05:48 Or maybe they can just get CBD oil,  prior to the Alzheimer's progressing and they will have improvement and NOT decline...  #CBDoil saves lives...  Just saying..  Many uses...
3326 2018-08-06 18:05:46 Malan espect good here
3327 2018-08-06 18:05:40 Because the Uk gave all their friends in oil industry tax relief that year And Norway made £15 billion that year .
3328 2018-08-06 18:05:40 I been using this argan oil shampoo which is good. But i start using this African mayonnaise stuff and it den dried her hair out. Ima goto walgreens wen im off bc i do be seeing it there on sale
3329 2018-08-06 18:05:35 ok ... so is this the same meeting as Kim and Vlad?  The one where the dictator pinky swears not to make anymore nuclear weapons and is willing to sell his oil to us for twice the market value?  Good Trade!
3330 2018-08-06 18:05:33 Girl do you air out ur room
Cause those oil toxins dont play
3331 2018-08-06 18:05:26 Ironic Saudi Arabia hasn't condemned the 9/11 twin tower attacks when 90% of the bombers were born in Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia was one of the main beneficiaries of the 9/11 attacks since Iraq oil was taken out of the world markets.

#cdnpoli #terrorist
3332 2018-08-06 18:05:24 It makes complete sense, let large areas of land be cleared free of charge and with the exponential cost of land in Cali then it can be like Mexico City, nothing but elitist allowed. They send the billions from the oil strike of the 80s and made an oppulent Jewel. Rt if you agree
3333 2018-08-06 18:05:20 Probably should have tried a Facebook body wrap or some tea tree oil.
3334 2018-08-06 18:05:20 This is not really a helpful piece of hyperbole....the entire energy sector in Canada (including electricity production and natural gas) amounts to 7% of GDP...compare that to the actual petrostate they are feuding with, Saudi Arabia, where oil production is 42% of GDP
3335 2018-08-06 18:05:19 Peppermint oil. 5-10 drops diluted in 1/2 cup water. Put in spray bottle & spritz all entrances and windows. Also helps repell ants.
3336 2018-08-06 18:05:16 We should  go further and ban all headwear especially in the oil and gas industry
3337 2018-08-06 18:05:10 I am definitely going to pick them up tomorrow so, everything I use always seems too harsh except for bio oil. Thank you so much, you’re a star!
3338 2018-08-06 18:05:07 Agree somewhat except that the value of metals is kept artificially high by controlling the amount released into use. Not unlike the diamond industry or oil industry how they slowly put new product out in a controlled way.

3340 2018-08-06 18:04:50 The first time i got an oil change on my own i deadass put it off for so long and i got there and they were like "bitch there isnt a single drop of oil in your car tf is wrong with you"
3341 2018-08-06 18:04:50 US has lots of oil they’d be happy to sell to Canada. 

I’d rather our money stays in North America than goes to the Middle East.
3342 2018-08-06 18:04:46 Believe! Faith always works. It stirs boldness, confidence, to dare the seemingly impossible. Notice Elisha’s bold faith when he ordered the widow to borrow vessels and pour oil. 2Kîngs 4. #Oil signified abundance in supply.

3345 2018-08-06 18:04:27 We all know this is because kenya is producing oil

3347 2018-08-06 18:04:24 $120 for an oil change, yeah I’m done 
3348 2018-08-06 18:04:23 Source of revenues for both = oil. ND and AK are both blessed with a lot of oil. Share our good fortune with the people. Don't just give it all to the politicians to foolishly spend.
3349 2018-08-06 18:04:12 @richardbranson Hello! You can confirm this information from - Palm Beach Research Group: "Billionaire Richard Branson announced his intention to put millions into cars powered by “Brandt Oil” technology." ???
3350 2018-08-06 18:04:07 There's no such thing as an "FPSO drill ship". There are FPSOs and drillships neither of which are relevant to the accuracy of the oil and gas related revenue allocated in GERS. 2016/17 GERS records a deficit of £13.3 billion including a geographical share of O&G revenue.
3351 2018-08-06 18:04:03 Having baked with both sour cream and mayo in the recipes, I could see this working. It’s egg and oil, so sweeting it makes it custardy maybe?
3352 2018-08-06 18:04:01 Isn't the more important issue how we get off of fossil fuels? The Permian geologic period ended in the Great Extinction, which wiped out most marine and terrestrial creatures. Our profligate burning of oil, gas and coal could lead us to the same. #KeepItInTheGround

3355 2018-08-06 18:03:53 Before you go and piss off your largest oil supplier, you might consider alternative sources. Alberta oil ain't so "dirty" when it is 40 below.
3356 2018-08-06 18:03:53 Also, Alaska doesn't produce anywhere near as much as North Dakota does in oil.  California produces more oil than Alaska does.
3357 2018-08-06 18:03:36 They're voluntary transactions, yes. Oil companies don't have to develop a given piece of land. They can if they strike the right royalty agreement with the private or public entity owning the land.
3358 2018-08-06 18:03:32 They are like the winds of hell, terrible.

3361 2018-08-06 18:03:09 Remember when you told me you couldn’t come over to my house because you were 100 miles over on getting your oil changed ? 
@fosco_dash
3362 2018-08-06 18:03:06 If it were me, I'd say that ship has sailed. No negotiations until the $150 Billion in cash is repaid (I'll take oil) and a list of all people and countries who took kickbacks to make sure the Iran deal went through. Then I'd make them recognize Israel and their right to exist.

3365 2018-08-06 18:02:37 The bright side would be that renewables would have to get cranked up and could finally show their viability to drastically reduce the use of oil and gas if supported.
3366 2018-08-06 18:02:30 Absolutely.  They are amazing people, truly.
3367 2018-08-06 18:02:29 I'm not arguing against the oil tax. I'm pointing out that the source of revenues for the Legacy Fund is fundamentally different from the source of money for the Permanent Fund.
3368 2018-08-06 18:02:23 Thinking of excuses to tell the guy why it’s been so long since I’ve got my oil changed I’m scared lol

3371 2018-08-06 18:01:45 Thats great to hear, but is no surprise.  What wonderful soldiers we have, and fantastic vets!!  Give them my thanks, please.
3372 2018-08-06 18:01:17 I love living in this age of modern technology and medicine, but a part of me really regrets never getting to dump cauldrons of boiling oil on the heads of my enemies.
3373 2018-08-06 18:01:16 Ya know when I started changing my own oil I thought I'd save money. Problem is I just end up buying more expensive oil and filters.

3391 2018-08-06 17:59:28 So ever since I anointed my son with the oil of chrism and told him that King Solomon is his patron saint he's been a charming dream.

He asked me to read him Solomon's stories from my grownup Bible and he made a rule book.

3393 2018-08-06 17:59:10 The use explosives to put out oil well fires (see Red Adair) it literally blows the fire out, so not such a mad capped idea.

3397 2018-08-06 17:58:14 Hey John, long time fan and follower of your work I had a question; I know you were helping in efforts to clean up water quality with the BP oil spill a couple years back. Did you help develope this new #DRONIC #tech that combats algae blooms with ultrasonic waves?

3399 2018-08-06 17:58:10 An energy sector veteran like @electhugh would know that the oil industry is not homogenous; some companies oppose carbon taxes, but many others want price certainty & support it. They are joined by most Canadian economists & notable Cons such as Dinning, Manning, Chong. #cdnpoli
3400 2018-08-06 17:58:10 Alex Jones and facts go together like oil and water.
3401 2018-08-06 17:57:54 I need sombdy to come oil my scalp

3404 2018-08-06 17:57:38 You’re just living off your mom and future step dad oil field money.
3405 2018-08-06 17:57:38 Am I the only disgusting freak who drinks the oil& balsamic vinegar from the bottom of an empty salad bowl??
3406 2018-08-06 17:57:37 I'm so excited to make something for my roommates hmm i think I'll make potato rings as an appetizer to warm up the oil so that I don't fuck up the pork, plus my roommates love those 
The oil has been used a few times and has a lotta stuff in it so it'll taste better too
3407 2018-08-06 17:57:20 DRY HAIR

Do hydrating hair mask

Don't wash hair with hot water

Use oils like coconut oil 

Always use conditioner
3408 2018-08-06 17:57:16 So I read extensively online about post-pill hair loss. You need to leave around 6 months for your body to adjust & start producing its own hormones needed for hair growth. Then it can take anywhere between a year-3 years to grow back fully! I started using home oil treatments...
3409 2018-08-06 17:57:03 Almost all of KSA's oil goes to Europe or Asia
3410 2018-08-06 17:57:01 Can’t see that pic blurred by all the oil  
3411 2018-08-06 17:56:58 Lots of Navy friends here.  They are all more conservative than me and great people.
3412 2018-08-06 17:56:58 Ya can’t b a gooner and a west ham. That’s like mixing water with oil
3413 2018-08-06 17:56:56 for the past year ish or so i have been removing my eye makeup with baby oil and now my lashes are thicc, strong, and healthy totally recommenddd
3414 2018-08-06 17:56:51 Isn't that just dandy.  How was this allowed to happen?   It's not like it was a big secret that the grid was vulnerable. How about ATC, gas/oil pipelines, financial institutions, stock markets?  The USA dies with a whimper? Get your shit together b4 it's too late
3415 2018-08-06 17:56:38 this is already the real life goal of coal and oil executives
3416 2018-08-06 17:56:37 There are multiple sources that describe him the same way. In this one it says "According to prosecutors, in April 2012, Sporyshev met an undercover FBI employee posing as an analyst at a New York energy firm at an oil and gas industry conference."
3417 2018-08-06 17:56:29 Not sure if this is a smoothie or not. It has the texture of soft serve ice cream. Freeze banana slices. Put them in a blender with water or almond milk, stevia (optional), flavoring. I use fair trade certified cocoa and occasionally a few drops of peppermint oil
3418 2018-08-06 17:56:26 This is why the Republican Governor doesn't support public transportation.  The pro oil administration want folks driving.
3419 2018-08-06 17:56:26 Palm oil is poison
3420 2018-08-06 17:56:17 Putin? At a rate that would be typical coming out of recession.  It was at a Much slower rate.  He told manufacturing workers there jobs were just gone never to come back.  He told coal he was shutting them down. He regulated to the detriment of steel and oil refineries
3421 2018-08-06 17:56:13 And then oil spat the dummy.
3422 2018-08-06 17:56:10 Holy hell, new units are not oil, they are water. They’re investments because they are scarce, not because they’re plentiful. To the extent there will always be demand for money-laundering, currency-arbitraging investments, NOT building things is not going REDUCE that demand.
3423 2018-08-06 17:56:08 My mom gave me cbd oil, so sorry that the world is gonna end tomorrow
3424 2018-08-06 17:56:05 Beautiful is an understatement
3425 2018-08-06 17:56:02 youre talking about the way the foresty industry or oil industry has push them from their land. pushed them out of their home.thats bullshit, and i agree with you 100%. pick which side youre talking about carefully.100% agree with you talking to me the same way about your country
3426 2018-08-06 17:55:59 Simple. Education & BJP are like oil & water. they are systematically breaking down JNU, JU & others. If this folks are reelected. we woud have only RSS education.

3429 2018-08-06 17:55:11 Okay we just got an oil pen and tried it and I really got flower to smoke too because I love flower so much. I LOVE dabs but the oil pen was so different idk if I liked it or not
3430 2018-08-06 17:55:09 Over intake of cannabis oil. Been slow all day.
3431 2018-08-06 17:55:08 Briogeo makes a charcoal revitalizing scalp treatment that works really well but it’s kinda expensive. For a cheaper option exfoliating the scalp with something like coffee grounds mixed with coconut oil for nourishment should help
3432 2018-08-06 17:55:08 So Nigeria had no oil in 1990?
3433 2018-08-06 17:55:03 Ah, but Venezuela was propped up by oil prices that went off and explored Mars in 2004-08 and then again until 2014. The net effect was certainly larger than Soviet subsidies for the equivalent years of the Cuban revolution, yet Venezuela only half-assedly Cubanized.
3434 2018-08-06 17:54:57 Oil is fungible, and the Saudis are already buying U.S. oil and reselling it to the Chinese. So, not worried so much, really.
3435 2018-08-06 17:54:53 I’m not saying Alex Jones and a few in the hatemongering right business aren’t true believers, but the vast majority of them are grifters (which is why their grift are usually propped up by tons of merch and snake oil padding).
3436 2018-08-06 17:54:53 okay i’m going to buy clove oil (everyone keeps saying that) 
and a slurpee
3437 2018-08-06 17:54:51 Congrats on the improvements. Are you seeing any changes in XOP and Oil?
3438 2018-08-06 17:54:50 Drove all around arklow with no oil cap, which is now lost. So my car is out of action and now I have to walk to the corner for milk. I deserve this.
3439 2018-08-06 17:54:45 I didn’t say any of it was tied to saving lives. Your idiot president did. Most educAted people know it’s about filling the pockets of oil companies
3440 2018-08-06 17:54:33 You do realize the US is the largest oil producer in the world?  A war is a very expensive way to "steal" oil.
3441 2018-08-06 17:54:03 @jdblum23 Nice story about offshore oil terminals, but how deep is the water?  20ft, 35ft? 60ft?  It's too muddy in the ship channel to guess.
3442 2018-08-06 17:53:37 Dude.  They have had the technology to be at 75 mpg since the 90s.    What planet are u on.   Oil companies won’t have it
3443 2018-08-06 17:53:35 Oil? The Treasury is having to pay money to compensate oil companies for tax paid. These others? What are you talking about? The rest of the U.K. has plenty of resources of its own. They certainly don’t depend on us. We depend on them for our Barnett £13 billion a year.
3444 2018-08-06 17:53:13 This is another reason Canada shouldn’t be buying oil from this country by doing so we as Canadians only support their barbaric regime.
3445 2018-08-06 17:53:11 I try to keep the oil changed, but sometimes I'm just busy or forget ya know?
3446 2018-08-06 17:53:03 知らぬ間に撮られてたｗ
3447 2018-08-06 17:52:57 Its funny. I doubt even you can call what you do a legit news outlet with a straight face. All you are is a snake oil salesman thats profits off of ignorance and fear.
3448 2018-08-06 17:52:51 i just realized i didnt fully wash off the coconut oil n sugar i rubbed onto my face and im already out lf the shower please help me
3449 2018-08-06 17:52:26 Turdface wasnt destroying our economy fast enuf by demonizing AB. oil/blocking pipe, so hes backing this&keeping KSA oil
3450 2018-08-06 17:52:24 Is it just me? Isn't that one of the things that a lot of Middle Eastern Countries & oil producers want?  A break away from the US Dollar. Saddam wanted to go with the Euro, as did Venezuela. Now Trump is helping out.
3451 2018-08-06 17:52:24 He did this to pleae Israel & to have an excuse to steal oil
3452 2018-08-06 17:52:20 stop buying saudi oil and use our own
3453 2018-08-06 17:52:17 The EU nations will be maintaining the JCPOA agreement with Iran & will ensure Iran continued its oil export

This is a huge embarrassment to Trump as he is increasingly being isolated in int relations

Expect some extreme retaliation on EU

My guess is more Tariff & Trade war
3454 2018-08-06 17:52:08 Anyone have any extra oil or acrylic paint I can cop from them? 
3455 2018-08-06 17:51:59 As Shakespeare said “ Perhaps he doth protest too much”.  Maybe a vested interest in buying oil outside of Canada?
3456 2018-08-06 17:51:56 Unfortunately, they don't care about Yemen or any other Arabic country since there is no oil there.
3457 2018-08-06 17:51:55 Three trusts fund baby’s who made their cash in russia on oil refinery’s seems its always going back to russia  destroys the usa 
3458 2018-08-06 17:51:53 Looking for 2 X Financial Analysts for a global oil service company in Nigeria. The candidate must have a degree in accounting/finance and be a chartered accountant with a recognised professional body. Previous working experience in the 'Big 4' companies is essential.
3459 2018-08-06 17:51:51 Cast iron is perfect for baking dessert in! This pan would make a great additional to my cast iron blueberry lemon scone post. It’s getting lots of action on Pinterest.  Do you prefer butter or an oil base to keep dessert from sticking?
3460 2018-08-06 17:51:46 Sadly I didn't... Not where I'm from at least, oil labor is whats hot where I live, and from what I remember lots of people were paid off, now it's different, but nah never saw it, wish I did
3461 2018-08-06 17:51:42 Oil change?
3462 2018-08-06 17:51:40 Just did a little googling, apparently some spiders are able to make non-sticky web. And confirming my misconception: “they don’t have oily legs, as they don’t have an oil gland”, but apparently they do have a glue gland. Spiders are weird. Lol.
3463 2018-08-06 17:51:40 What's wrong with it?
3464 2018-08-06 17:51:34 If we can run pipelines all over the country for oil then we can run pipelines for water.
3465 2018-08-06 17:51:33 Didn’t japan kick Stalin’s ass?  Destroyed their pacific navy, only losing three ships in the process. Took Korea and took control of Russian oil fields.  Oh yeah, they were afraid of Stalin.
3466 2018-08-06 17:51:29 I'd rather have Canadian oil than Mid East oil.  Cheaper and not dependant on the whims of the oil sheiks.  A strong Oil industry means more jobs for Canadians
3467 2018-08-06 17:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
3468 2018-08-06 17:51:04 Coconut oil..!

3470 2018-08-06 17:50:56 In one of those oil cans. Or if they really cheap...one of those large Tubberware boxes people use to stir stuff like Xmas decorations.
3471 2018-08-06 17:50:49 Especially when I know so much oil is trapped in that bun
3472 2018-08-06 17:50:49 Coffee. Burning midnight oil. Back to market analysis.
3473 2018-08-06 17:50:44 According to a state-run website known as Entekhab (Sunday 1 June 2018), the regime’s vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri, states: “#Iran’s crude oil will be offered on the domestic bourse, and for the private sector who can export it in tonnages, as required. As of now, we (1/16)
3474 2018-08-06 17:50:42 @AdeBanqie @NNPCgroup COO, Refineries and Petrochemicals said oil coys should tap into insurance sector for new funds: "Their horizon is aligned with ours in terms of obligations they have, returns they are looking for..." please enlighten me, is this realistic?
3475 2018-08-06 17:50:37 Canadian government does not buy oil from saudis. Private oil companies within Canada buy from saudis.

This is definitely not rocket science.
3476 2018-08-06 17:50:37 I think the PM was supposed to show some nuance in addressing such questions. He shouldn’t say things in manner that opens door for controversy. For the past few days, Many DDSI officials were saying ‘we won’t accept anything < 75 % of the total revenue from the oil extraction’.
3477 2018-08-06 17:50:37 It doesn't take this long to change my oil... this is hellish
3478 2018-08-06 17:50:36 It’s getting there. Check when they discovered oil in UAE and when they started developing then track when they found oil and when they started developing
3479 2018-08-06 17:50:26 Serius kok pake jojoba sama grapseed oil
3480 2018-08-06 17:50:15 Cooking oil expires????????? Wow I never noticed...
3481 2018-08-06 17:50:14 Lol at that oil field trash guy hitting my bumper intentionally.  Glad it’s widely known I don’t have insurance.  Is that standard operating procedure to discuss credit card bills with someone?  How does he know?  Keep the oil field trash out of my financial statements please
3482 2018-08-06 17:50:13 . If Russia does decide to go on with the railway TEPR linking Russia to Alaska it said that new railing network, oil & gas pipelines would be rebuilt this would cost alot of money to do & may hurt the economy unitll these new systems would be ready to use. @geography_411
3483 2018-08-06 17:50:12 stop buying saudi oil and use our own.

3485 2018-08-06 17:49:57 I love oil paintings
3486 2018-08-06 17:49:56 You are NOT a conservative “news outlet.”

You’re a race-baiting, violence-inciting, conspiracy-spreading snake oil salesman who made his riches by attacking the victims of tragedies & selling fake pills to your gullible, naive, unhinged followers.

Good riddance, traitor 
3487 2018-08-06 17:49:56 Up your sex game. It's your fault another man is helping to oil your engine
3488 2018-08-06 17:49:55 If it wasn’t an oil rich, financially poor country in political turmoil I’d think otherwise about US involvement. But because Venezuela is. It looks like the next perfect victim of the United States military industrial complex.
3489 2018-08-06 17:49:52 Yes my grandad see it all in the late 60s when we was twice European cup winners. I don't follow the oil money I'm a real fan

3491 2018-08-06 17:49:46 none that are cheaper :( you may also wanna splurge on the B-Hydra, but as for Lala, you could probably get away with just using extra T.O. marula oil as needed
3492 2018-08-06 17:49:20 Cakes made with olive oil are underrated. I'd polish that off in one go.

3495 2018-08-06 17:49:07 aside from sov and corp ext debt (public and private)?....yes, agreed. Bad habits? can lean to a SWF or something similar (a la oil exporting countries), but happy to park that. Thanks for the comments. 
3496 2018-08-06 17:49:02 Wow, you are naive dude. Big oil, OPEC etc have been "colluding" since forever! So have most big industries, like pharma...
3497 2018-08-06 17:48:48 COCONUT OIL 4 life
3498 2018-08-06 17:48:46 Extra virgin nga yung totoong pure, lesser processed variety, best for salads and similar kasi mabilis masunog. Pure is actually refined olive oil, mixed with some virgin olive oil, lower grade overall kaya mas mura, can be used for cooking over heat.
3499 2018-08-06 17:48:42 carbon tax! I see our government response to our high use of oil,coal, electricity etc is to hike the tax on it. no alternatives just tax. and fairy tail asperations about electric cars.

3503 2018-08-06 17:48:15 Met three very nice men from the Swedish Fire Department and learned there hasn't been a fire in a Swedish hotel for 20 years. Also, I shouldn't cook eggplant on such a high heat without more oil and the window open.

3505 2018-08-06 17:48:02 Pizza is bread with oil, sauce, cheese, and other toppings on top. 

Calzones are not pizzas, they are pies.
3506 2018-08-06 17:47:51 The purpose of Energy East was to export oil out of the country.  Never really made any economic or geographic sense.
3507 2018-08-06 17:47:51 get T.O.’s marula oil, CeraVe’s cleanser(s), and your choice of drugstore sunscreen (preferably mineral-only, but if you sweat you’ll need chemical screens)
3508 2018-08-06 17:47:49 This is how juiced you get when you buy his overpriced snake oil supplements.
3509 2018-08-06 17:47:48 My dating site states as a requirement you must use “fur oil” on pubic hairs...
3510 2018-08-06 17:47:47 Still its shit and when oil trade is over in couple years/decades your reserve will mean nothing lol our economy is way more diverse than yours haha
3511 2018-08-06 17:47:37 We tried that once, on behalf of an oil company no less, toppled a democratically elected Prime Minister and propped up the Shah. It is the single most reason why we are where we are today.  I bet no one in administration knows this
3512 2018-08-06 17:47:17 I don't have a seanad vote, but I would like to enter my vote for the spent cooking oil drowning thanks

3514 2018-08-06 17:47:09 @DingoDan6 hey brother received the beard oil today and all I can say is wow, this is one of the best barbershop scents I've ever smelled I absolutely love it thanks again, now all I need is a matching balm 
3515 2018-08-06 17:47:02 Here's the thing. You are one oil crisis away from complete economic collapse & civil unrest. Your country is a failed state being propped up by oil. Your government is corrupt, your military laughably incompetent and your populace decadent and soft.
3516 2018-08-06 17:47:02 Will my coconut oil ever be solid again?
3517 2018-08-06 17:46:51 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
3518 2018-08-06 17:46:44 What are they “doing” there? Drilling vertically for oil? Fracking a vertical well ? Or fracking a horizontal well ( i doubt that) for oil?
3519 2018-08-06 17:46:39 Exactly. They are good for two things

Bait and eating (most people don’t)

My grandmother would clean them, flour them and fry the crisp in olive oil. Can’t buy them in stores anymore so what are they doing with them.

Can we just put the fires out and stop the other nonsense?
3520 2018-08-06 17:46:39 I recommend checking out @ApricotRotten’s beard oil.

3522 2018-08-06 17:46:27 Alex Jones refers to himself as, "The tip of the spear of liberty and truth."

Alex Jones also says the 26 babies killed at #SandyHook were paid actors, as were their parents.

He's an infected boil on the ass of America. He's a snake oil salesman who literally sells snake oil.
3523 2018-08-06 17:46:25 @IainDale I wouldn't necessarily say   (as did Sharia) that Iran would get inferior goods from China (in exchange for oil). The latter will be keen to develop Iranian infrastructure as they have in Africa.
3524 2018-08-06 17:46:16 Of course you don't. But we do. Saudi Arabia buys weapons like crazy from US, UK, France and even Canada. In return, we buy oil like crazy. That being said, the Badawi issue is a very sensitive one in Canada. His kids are here. Just send us the guy already.
3525 2018-08-06 17:46:13 i used to spend $50 on argan oil and i feel like i wasted my money tbh
3526 2018-08-06 17:46:11 My reason is misguided? Or were you just attempting a clever response and couldn’t quite piece it together?

Trudeau has been neglecting our energy infrastructure. Now it may cost us. But I’ll be damned the day I bow to the Saudis or any other abusive regime, just for their oil.
3527 2018-08-06 17:46:04 serve our country by killing for oil good ol us of a baby
3528 2018-08-06 17:45:58 I thought Pakistan gave up oil for gas in the Iran Pakistan Border Areas. Or was it one big urban myth.
3529 2018-08-06 17:45:44 Thank goodness! You snake oil charlatan. Go away, far away.
3530 2018-08-06 17:45:42 Hi there, lane closures are necessary as the fire was severe enough to significantly damage the surface of the carriageway in lanes 2 and 3 and there was a large oil spillage in lane 1.
3531 2018-08-06 17:45:41 Oil revenue is large part of life blood supply to corrupt, ruthless Khamenei regime.Cutting it denies funds to Khamenei henchmen at home&abroad.Oil&Iran national bank sanctions are most effective US tools available to aid Iranian people’s movement to rid themselves of the regime.
3532 2018-08-06 17:45:37 I just wanted to update you all on Tess she's not showing any signs of improvement even though we are still giving her the CBD oil and her medication.please keep her in your thoughts and prayers I would be eternally grateful.
3533 2018-08-06 17:45:33 Absolutely! But oh my, wherever would we get our oil? Does anyone know of a place in Canada that produces oil???
3534 2018-08-06 17:45:20 Recommendation moisturise and reduces oil
3535 2018-08-06 17:45:06 The amount of oil on my face rn could fry 3 eggs to think that I even used oil control
3536 2018-08-06 17:45:02 [social democracy with a larger private sector than britain collapses because of falling oil prices and an embargo] ah, pure socialism fails again
3537 2018-08-06 17:44:54 #Sudan-ese president says that #SouthSudan is rich with oil, minerals, livestock, water and fertile land. #SaveTheLastTrain
3538 2018-08-06 17:44:51 Is there no diplomacy kind of thing in Saudi Arabia.What are they trying to portray to other states of world.
Oil filled minds of Sheikhs!
3539 2018-08-06 17:44:48 Hello Mo. I remember gagging on spoonfuls of cod liver oil and malt.
3540 2018-08-06 17:44:34 Agreed. Canada has plenty of their own oil, and what else... positive does Saudi Arabia export?
3541 2018-08-06 17:44:30 Loooooooool jojoba oil twitter  nah ive heard all types of names now but i dont understand why BW hair is policed so much
3542 2018-08-06 17:44:15 @IainDale Watch out for very personal benefit when it comes to safe passage of oil tankers.
3543 2018-08-06 17:44:10 Knowing that one of my favorite bands is blocked by the "godly" snake oil salesman that nearly destroyed my hometown singlehandedly makes me love them all the more.
3544 2018-08-06 17:44:01 Reminder to self, always check if oil is expired before cooking with it.
Legit threw me off for 4 days.
3545 2018-08-06 17:43:59 Seriously bruh you are right., the Kano state house of Assembly are not really doing their main primary assignments., bunch of hypocrisy fellows
3546 2018-08-06 17:43:52 Fine, but they sell it to Canada’s east coast refineries and that Saudi oil could be replaced by Canadian if Energy East was allowed to be built. However the hypocrites running Quebec and Montreal and their vote driven friends in power in Ottawa won’t allow it.
3547 2018-08-06 17:43:51 I've called you and Alex cnuts on many occasion, why are you supressing my free speech? I deserve a platform on the Snake Oil show, why are you celebrating your oppression of my free speech, you so called free speech advocates are just like the illiberals #SquealingLikeASnowflake
3548 2018-08-06 17:43:49 You haven’t even defined your basic argument and now you want me to define “exploit”? Well, since there would be no governments, who would punish an oil company for simply stealing your land, poisoning your water and killing your family?
3549 2018-08-06 17:43:48 Will all due respect to the Saudi people on this thread. The SA government is using Oil as leverage power against Canada because we called out the government on their poor human rights record. Our bad for not being energy secure so we do not depend on foreign oil.
3550 2018-08-06 17:43:42 My car driving like nas trying to find the beat on “Nasir” oil change time
3551 2018-08-06 17:43:20 I just wanna go home and oil my scalp 
3552 2018-08-06 17:43:11 Hollow out the core, make some ratatouille stuff it in the there and top with bread crumbs, olive oil, parmesan, fresh herbs etc and roast. That’s what I would do.
3553 2018-08-06 17:43:00 Hello Twitter! We can't wait to launch our first product... We're thinking a facial tonic or beard oil. What do you think? What are your needs as a man with a beard? #DanPortland #Beard #BeardOil #MensSkinCare
3554 2018-08-06 17:42:46 .@MNPDNashville has arranged police vans to block the media' view of their removal efforts of the protesters at #CoreCivic Protest - they currently have people interlocked within large concrete filled oil barrels, and a lady in a 40ft wooden tripod
3555 2018-08-06 17:42:37 Water:
Tastes like nothing
No nutritional value
Comes from dirty rivers and ponds

Canola oil:
Great taste
Full of nutrients
Comes from clean seeds

Now which one should I drink 8 cups of everyday? I think we all know the answer.
3556 2018-08-06 17:42:28 There’s a possibly apocryphal story that during the early 1970s oil embargo a grade called “Peruvian Blend” suddenly appeared on the market. Available FOB Caribbs. Assays showed that, shockingly, it wasn’t possible to distinguish Peruvian Blend from Arab Light.
3557 2018-08-06 17:42:17 Nothing . You are right it needs it but what people don’t realise is that the money is coming from Northlands budget for road upgrades . Which it will need as infrastructure to perform better economically. Also the winding down of the oil industry won’t help either.
3558 2018-08-06 17:42:04 This should have happened years ago. Why import oil? Because off a couple of idiot's in Quebec.
3559 2018-08-06 17:42:00 Uh yeah no. Pretty sure BP is still a functioning company despite tanking the entire gulf economy. Why? Because they have control of their market share. There isn’t always other choices for oil, and their business doesn’t solely involve customer facing sales
3560 2018-08-06 17:41:59 The Larry h Miller dealership took 6 hours to do my oil change. Today I went to go get it tested to see if they really did it....THEY LIED AND ACTUALLY DIDNT PREFORM AN OIL CHANGE!
3561 2018-08-06 17:41:49 Go figure!  I'm not surprised at the Arabs and Palestinians support as Saudi Arabia is an oil rich country.  They don't seem to share Canada's views of what human rights actually are. I support Canada on this one. 
3562 2018-08-06 17:41:48 FRIZZY HAIR

Use coconut oil after shower to prevent frizz

Don't brush it while it's dry

Don't add heat to your hair

Deep conditioning EVERY WEEK!
3563 2018-08-06 17:41:47 Sitting and waiting for my car.. A oil change is all I need they said 2hrs b4 your car will be ready. I should have brought my lunch.
3564 2018-08-06 17:41:43 I don't do septic tanks.
The basics: if it didn't come out of your body or come on a roll intended for next to the loo, don't flush it.
In the kitchen: no grease or oil, wipe/scrape into trash. Use a screen to minimize particulates. 1/
3565 2018-08-06 17:41:40 Coconut oil girl !! I use it for everythinggg
3566 2018-08-06 17:41:34 Eish FAM today have had like 9 eggs already thinking of making more! But u need to make it wit butter not fish oil
3567 2018-08-06 17:41:32 Hey Peter! Thanks so much for your love & support. Please note that the certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)
3568 2018-08-06 17:41:32 Yes those pipelines that could increase wealth for Canada and allow Quebec to replace importing Saudi oil with Canada oil.
3569 2018-08-06 17:41:27 Just spilled OIL BASED foundation all over my entire life it’s fine I’m fine
3570 2018-08-06 17:41:21 Sadly this nonce from Chelsea is just so dense I don’t think we can any longer take anything he says with any credibility. He’s hung up on our success and our oil money - pretty sure he’s a racist or jealous...maybe you’ll get a better idea 
3571 2018-08-06 17:41:18 Nothing has hurt my soul more than my grandma calling for my help with my papa the second I lathered up with tanning oil and got situated in my kiddie pool 
3572 2018-08-06 17:40:57 พระวัดไหนสอนหนูลูกกกก
3573 2018-08-06 17:40:51 Still using palm oil? Shame on you.The demise of the rainforest will be on your heads. But, hey, tasty chocolate!
3574 2018-08-06 17:40:47 Canada is now self sufficient in oil production yet still imports roughly 2 billions $ a year from Saudi Arabia. @Canada you want to make a statement? Put a ban on oil imports from #SaudiArabia and finish the pipelines needed.
3575 2018-08-06 17:40:45 yup exactly the same with us except all the oil was gone! I was thinking of just adding more as we had a ton of samples, but the engineer said if that pump goes and the oil gets into the Lumos, it's history. So nope we waited for a new pump!
3576 2018-08-06 17:40:41 Snake Oil has many incarnations. All should be illegal,and their salespeople, like Jones, should be prosecuted for fraud.

3580 2018-08-06 17:40:24 Went to get my oil changed in my car and i almost bought a new car. Jesus help me lol
3581 2018-08-06 17:40:19  coconut oil.
3582 2018-08-06 17:40:18 I'm sure you've attempted or had this circular conversation many times. I don't oppose education and training. I oppose the way dudes like you have obstructed bike infrastructure desired by the other 99% of the cycling community. Take your snake oil somewhere else—not interested.
3583 2018-08-06 17:40:16 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3584 2018-08-06 17:40:15 How many young men and women will die on the altar of this brutal regime? People are dying of hunger in a country where oil wealth goes into billions of dollars. Shameless rulers who have only one agenda to stick to their rule and enjoy it's privileges.
3585 2018-08-06 17:40:09 In the best traditions of the grannies of Bengal, sautéed some cubed jheenge (ridge gourd) in mustard oil tempered with a dried red chilli, a tea spoon of panch phoron (whole 5 spice), a little bit of water, a sprinkling of turmeric and salt for dinner.

‘Less is more’ anyone?
3586 2018-08-06 17:40:09 I knew the guy was a snake oil salesman, but I don't think I realised quite as much until now, how much he resembles a TV-preacher; albeit of his own particular conspiracy cult.

Except that instead of prayer cards & blessed pieces of cloth, he sells bottles of SuperMaleVitality.
3587 2018-08-06 17:40:09 I wish these folks would hurry up with this oil change
3588 2018-08-06 17:40:06 My pain clinic said their malpractice insurance carrier won't allow them to Rx opioids to patients who test positive for THC.  My Dr is not happy that he can't even let us use CBD oil because of the very small # of users do end up testing positive for THC.
3589 2018-08-06 17:40:03 For the last week I’ve been using coconut oil to remove my makeup, which works great but it’s given me breakouts despite trying to cleanse it off. I now have some Jojoba oil arriving tomorrow which I hope will be better for my skin! 
3590 2018-08-06 17:40:03 inseason beauty, essential oil (menthol lip balm) ; benev or jannson cosmetics, trial size works. (pevonia)
3591 2018-08-06 17:40:02 When they stop electing the same old snake oil salesmen time after time, I'll take them seriously. Until then it's just another handout.
3592 2018-08-06 17:39:47 If u were working at a store and someone came in and bought a big bag of walnuts, canola oil and some socks, would u be concerned?

(A discussion starter a la Pierce)
3593 2018-08-06 17:39:45 Free Rolex watches, crap parenting, snake oil selling, traumatising parents of school shootings, MEP gravy train, pension and expense grubbing, faux patriotism and BS spouting?  Seeing how little you like to turn up to work Nigel, it's probably (pro rata) a high hourly rate?
3594 2018-08-06 17:39:42 #Timing is important here. Today finished buying #oil corporates. Selling soon. Bullish on #USD and #US10Y. Short #DAX. Investment period 6 months.  Still averaging in #miners and will continue till monetary reset.
3595 2018-08-06 17:39:33 Um, nope. Irving said way back that even if EE was built they would buy Saudi oil if the price were right. It's a business decision not a patriotic one.
3596 2018-08-06 17:39:18 An NUI registration drive and proactive campaign against Mullen is an awful lot of effort when we could all just hope really hard that he drowns in spent cooking oil

3601 2018-08-06 17:38:48 This bitch learning how to change oil! I'm car savvy, art savvy,animal savvy, travel savvy, well read, good at cuddles, someone fall in love with me already. I am A+ mate material
3602 2018-08-06 17:38:43 That's it, couldn't remember the name.
3603 2018-08-06 17:38:43 No you’re thinking of Rounders. Founders is a style of French cuisine that involves dipping meats and vegetables in melted cheese and oil.
3604 2018-08-06 17:38:36 Right - BECAUSE WE JUST NEED TO SPREAD LIES AND GARBAGE FROM A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN.  Grow TF up...this is not Censorship, this is Good Stewardship and if you cannot see that you're an idiot.  EVERYONE SHOULD MAKE IT A POINT TO SILENCE UNTRUTHS AND LIARS.
3605 2018-08-06 17:38:33 Agreed, Ken. Irving said ages ago that even if there were an EE pipeline, they'd reserve the right to buy Saudi oil if the price was right.
3606 2018-08-06 17:38:27 the squeaky wheel needs the oil

3610 2018-08-06 17:38:07 Keep up the good work. Please try to lower heating oil prices. This is hearing more people. People or losing there houses or can't pay other bills like food, pills loan payments. Take all fed. taxes Off heating oil and work on getting local Gov. to do the same. Lou
3611 2018-08-06 17:38:04 Umm.? Hydo-something?
3612 2018-08-06 17:37:54 Looking for info about medicinal cannabis (weed or oil derivatives, mainly oil). Anyone got details and could point me at campaigns and such? Like to get involved.
3613 2018-08-06 17:37:50 So honey went on sand becomes oil ..Which is now giving money
3614 2018-08-06 17:37:46 Do not judge! I learned this from the Food Network show The Kitchen. A shallow microwaveable dish, splash of water, drizzle of olive oil, sprinkles of course salt, one minute in the microwave and done! It works.
3615 2018-08-06 17:37:36 Try some CBD oil.
3616 2018-08-06 17:37:35 Based on this reply I see some justification of the Deputy's claims.
3617 2018-08-06 17:37:35 Liquid African Black Soap, Tamanu oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times),Lemon brightening overnight serum (use daily at night after cleansing),Green Tea Exfoliating Scrub (use once/twice a week) and Turmeric mask (use once/twice a week
3618 2018-08-06 17:37:33 Back in the early 80s when I was a really dumb oil trader (as opposed to just dumb now) I called Marc Rich's trade desk at about 9 pm one Houston night and Marc his own self took the call.  He was very nice to a new guy like me. #OOTT
3619 2018-08-06 17:37:24 Is Trudeau still allowing Saudi Oil into Canada? Why have Canadian governments been so cozy with the Saudi's who are the main source of funding, planing, participating in Sunni Arab Terrorism against Westerners, Iraq and Syria.
3620 2018-08-06 17:36:57 Personally, what I do for homemade sauce is I'll roast the tomatoes and garlic in the oven (with a drizzle of olive oil and salt/pepper) then while that's roasting you can cut up your other veggies (peppers, onions, mushrooms etc) and start frying them and adding spices and sugar
3621 2018-08-06 17:36:51 Bcos wen d oil companies drilled one hole in warri and struck oil, dey did not stop drilling, dey went to ondo to drill, dey went to akwa ibom to drill, dey went as far as d chad basin in the north to drill but dey know d other holes can never be like warri so dey come back home
3622 2018-08-06 17:36:46 Will things heat up so much that the east will freeze this winter. To bad Trudeau has no idea of what National security is build capacity from east to west. Support your COUNTRY! Stop the blood oil!

3624 2018-08-06 17:36:38 Unfortunately the damage to the nation was already done, and his following will continue to hit his site, buy his snake oil.

Intro session for my character is over, he's alive and unharmed and apparently our DM is amazing.

Also I realised just how deceptive he is. But I'm gonna tell you the oil flask story another time.
3630 2018-08-06 17:36:01 That was a prank we played in the Navy: Say to the newbie: go to the quartermaster and get me a "long weight." -- Long "wait". And also Red Oil for the port lanterns
3631 2018-08-06 17:35:57 네네!!!! 안녕하세요 반갑습니다
3632 2018-08-06 17:35:51 Thank you. 

Is Nigerian oil divided up between Europe and US, or.....???
3633 2018-08-06 17:35:50 I know I’m turning into an LA basic bitch because I said “ My coconut oil has been liquid for at least 3 weeks now!”
3634 2018-08-06 17:35:35 Imagine if we had a President who said we are going to Break the Oil industry as Barak Hussein said about the coal industry.
3635 2018-08-06 17:35:32 Gold mining, diamond mining and oil exploration. Follow the trail of natural resource extraction.
3636 2018-08-06 17:35:19 Tbh we need an entire oil about this. #화양연화TheNotes
3637 2018-08-06 17:35:17 Close quarters on those ships and submarines. 
Besides who said a submarine had to be shaped like that?
3638 2018-08-06 17:35:16 It won't be. We should never have made deals with human rights violators in the first place. This is long overdue. The rest of the world will follow when the oil frenzy is over. Another good thing about renewable energy, dependence on your oil is dwindling, along with its power.
3639 2018-08-06 17:35:16 Number 1 oil producer*

Idan mafadi wawane to Majiyi Ba wawa bane.
3642 2018-08-06 17:35:03 It’s $25 for an oil change my guy, go enjoy your left turns and chill lmao
3643 2018-08-06 17:34:59 Agree Ken. I don't think many Canadians want to centralize oil buying to domestic or a future NEB. Access to intl markets remains challenging for producers.
3644 2018-08-06 17:34:52 Aww, are the perpetrators and funders of 9/11 angry? So cute!

The West runs the world. You just sell oil... well, not for long. Hah!
3645 2018-08-06 17:34:51 We used to play this game of squeezing orange skin to get oil sprinkled out!
3646 2018-08-06 17:34:30 If state critique is what you want, skip snake oil Jones and see @telesurenglish @RevDrBarber @AbbyMartin Prof Noam Chomsky @BlackSocialists @ChrisLynnHedges @CornelWest @profwolff @RBReich @MazzucatoM @LeeCamp @KyleKulinski @jimmy_dore @FearDept @aantonop
3647 2018-08-06 17:34:27 What the fuck ? Maggie hen who told you that?  as their talking shite. Scotland has oil , fish , spring water , soft drinks , Scottish meat which is GM crop free , whisky , gin.  Very wealthy Scotland is and that why England need Scotland in the UK
3648 2018-08-06 17:34:26 If you’ve got no hope you’ll clutch at any straw! My younger Sister has just been told that there is no more they can do for her so should she try nothing? Maybe CBD oil or Curcumin?
3649 2018-08-06 17:34:24 Ok. See you in Naya Pakistan that is top 10 oil producer in the world 
3650 2018-08-06 17:34:23 Because, you know, they incite people to engage in harmful acts. Unlike Jones, whose followers harass the families of shooting victims and who's gotten rich by selling snake oil to desperate poor people. How impoverished would the marketplace of ideas be without guys like him?
3651 2018-08-06 17:34:18 This year’s #GenCon2018 featured more than 520 game companies, more than 600 new games, 17,000 ticketed events & an increase in programming in Lucas Oil Stadium. The convention plans to continue its development of Lucas Oil Stadium as a new hub of convention growth. @Gen_Con
3652 2018-08-06 17:34:06 No!  I'm told the sailors tend to be more politically conservative and are decent folk.
3653 2018-08-06 17:34:02 Olive oil?
3654 2018-08-06 17:34:01 We shouldn't have to rely on American's to do what we can on our own for our own!! we have immense oil resources and oddly immense oil import dependency!! that's beyond ridiculous it's internationally embarrassing!!
3655 2018-08-06 17:33:56 Luigi needs to love himself and buy some gun oil
3656 2018-08-06 17:33:51 He is waiting to see if Omar Al Gharba can bring in the peace. Wonder why all the libtards are quiet now ? Don’t ask me what I can do because I don’t get paid. JT does. Besides I would start the oil taps in AB keep wealth in Canada. To hell with them.
3657 2018-08-06 17:33:31 Just for the record, Europe wants Iran's oil and money. This need makes Europe look the other way. Iran broke the "deal" the first week and every week since.

Secondly, this deal was never passed by the Senate. It was another Obama political stunt.
3658 2018-08-06 17:33:28 @maxkellerman so it’s ok to be a president of America & kill your own people ala 9/11? It’s ok to go into Iraq and steal oil etc? @stephenasmith held to a higher standard my rear end - Your presidents are most corrupt evil people in the last 600 years 
3659 2018-08-06 17:33:22 Interesting, but I'm not surprised & I've honestly been getting more & more skeptical of the entire supplements industry.

But I'll note, as the article states, there still could be benefits and probably no downside, and there are vegan sources for Omega-3s (i.e., flaxseed oil).
3660 2018-08-06 17:33:20 Thankfully the other member nations are imposing blocks. #Trumpanzee is following #Putins orders to sanction #Iran, because #Putin does not want #Iran competition for OIL. #PutinsPuppetTrump
3661 2018-08-06 17:33:15 That looks suspiciously like you’ve mistaken olive oil for scotch! I was thinking about doing a limoncello and rose petal combo; Turkish Delight shots!
3662 2018-08-06 17:33:09 Hahahaha your wrong! Sierra Pathetic Power sells people power for way more than it costs. Already Solar & battery funding companies are preparing to install solar and batteries for free. Distributed Solar and Batteries are now cheaper that all Coal, Oil, Gas etc.
3663 2018-08-06 17:33:02 PDP has secretly met with oil marketers. They are planning to cause artificial fuel scarcity in November till 2019 elections.
3664 2018-08-06 17:33:00 Analysts u/estimated demand & thought #shale #oil co's would prod at <$50/bbl indefinitely. Lasted 18 months. 

Now analysts are u/estimating L-T #lithium demand & forecasting co's will prod at <$8,500/t indefinitely. A handful of co's can survive < $8,500 - prod way below demand
3665 2018-08-06 17:32:52 SALUTE from the portfolio The Juror
Théodore Mesens
Oil over board
3666 2018-08-06 17:32:44 Could not find oil til 1945...
3667 2018-08-06 17:32:27 ROG and plea bargains are the rule here. They avoid the armed charge in most cases, then the AG crys like a baby.
3668 2018-08-06 17:32:25 Newsflash: The nation has finally had enough of your evil circus act. You’re just a few ticks of the history clock from being deposited on the scrap heap of charlatans, clowns, and forgotten snake oil salesmen. You’ll be left broke and alone as your ilk always are.
3669 2018-08-06 17:32:23 Exactly. Entire US agri is petroleum based. Mechanized from top to bottom. Also reliant on Haber process fertilizers which require oil to produce. That was why the Regime started subsidizing corn, wheat, and soy so heavy in wake of 1973 Embargo.
3670 2018-08-06 17:32:21 ยังไม่หลับสักหน่อย
3671 2018-08-06 17:32:13 Way back when, Harold Hamm was a grease monkey my dad paid to assemble my bunk bed after a house move. He started his empire by over-pumping oil & under-reporting to leaseholders & selling the stolen oil on the side. "Everybody does it". No surprise he supports crooked Trump.
3672 2018-08-06 17:32:12 Why does Canada care about Saudi oil? We're more than self-sufficient and don't need anything from them.
3673 2018-08-06 17:32:09 Gaskiya his excellency has really disappointed me,this has shown that the House of Assembly are his puppet ,he controls them when they ought to be autonomous and impartial .
The shame and mediocrity in this reply has further justified the deputy Gov claim of sidelining.
3674 2018-08-06 17:32:05 Whether some people want to grasp this or not, the shift to renewable energy is a wise business decision. Regardless if you choose to ignore a plethora of climate scientists, there Is only so much oil beneath earth's surface. Solar, geothermal, ect. are billion dollar industries
3675 2018-08-06 17:31:54 So wat were u doing digging for oil well
3676 2018-08-06 17:31:46 Perfect. We have everything we need within our borders. You have nothing but oil no one but China needs anymore, and sand (we have plenty, thanks). 

There is no international market for the garbage bags you make your women wear.
3677 2018-08-06 17:31:34 Next time, rub oil first.
3678 2018-08-06 17:31:23 Coconut oil? Yikes
3679 2018-08-06 17:31:16 Diemin lah kan face oil
3680 2018-08-06 17:31:16 what are the chances Saudi Arabia and the United States invade Canada and take the oil?
3681 2018-08-06 17:31:15 Yea they are hidden.  They found our leak during PM but the engineer couldn’t get new pumps quick enough so he hooked up the old pumps and left...  Been two weeks and half the oil leaked out already 
3682 2018-08-06 17:31:10 You cannot monopolize thoughts. ideas, and opinions like is possible with oil, steel, etc... Trying to analogize between the two doesn’t really work.  There is nothing to prevent you from building your own Facebook right now. All you need is a AWS or Azure account & some coders.
3683 2018-08-06 17:31:10 Another senseless war. Death of our kids for ur oil then a horrid vacuum w/ ceaseless battles, & ur war mongers again making $ off it?
3684 2018-08-06 17:31:08 Energy East should start next week, and no more oil from Saudi
3685 2018-08-06 17:31:02 THANK YOU
3686 2018-08-06 17:30:48 All of you middle eastern Islamic totalitarianist regimes are state sponsors of terror. Your accusations are hypocritical. 

This is why we’re making our own oil. Buying from crazies like you is bad for us. Go deal with China hah!
3687 2018-08-06 17:30:48 banyak sih ada garnier senka biore, mirip2 micellar water kali ya tp yg oil. coba ajaa kamu search cleansing oil drugstore
3688 2018-08-06 17:30:46 Blend 1/3 cup coffee with 3 pints bluefish. Add Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve on a bed of pasta
3689 2018-08-06 17:30:44 What is "correct"?  They did a review in the midst of an oil price crash. It was a huge mistake. They should have held off.

We currently generate more revenue from gambling and alcohol than we do from resource royalties. That should be alarming.
3690 2018-08-06 17:30:37 Notice: Trump STILL hasn't stopped the USA from buying Iranian Oil. That part, which *will* cause a spike in the price of gas at the pump, doesn't go into effect until *after* the midterms.
3691 2018-08-06 17:30:36 Cut off all oil improrts from SA
3692 2018-08-06 17:30:35 Eating surrounded by those final black paintings! Really, really something. The walls would have been all sooty and grimy from the oil lamps for lighting, too. Uuff.

3700 2018-08-06 17:30:01 Or stop buying their dirty oil.
3701 2018-08-06 17:29:58 They will use their billions in oil to buy all the Canadian maple syrup and force canadians to pay extra for maple syrup and still only be able to get American maple syrup.
3702 2018-08-06 17:29:54 That's what they say, they're very happy, except when you get those crazy winds.
3703 2018-08-06 17:29:49 sounds like you and your bot technically WON, but the mainstream media won’t accept that
3704 2018-08-06 17:29:46 Oil and ports among other things
3705 2018-08-06 17:29:44 Our government stands up for human rights, and don't expect to sell your oil to western countries if you won't play by the rules.
3706 2018-08-06 17:29:40 Just a nice way of saying old. We just gotta admit it and use Oil Of Olay. Lots of it.

3710 2018-08-06 17:29:00 how many oil companies are behind this?...
3711 2018-08-06 17:28:55 I read you can wrap your feet with baby oil & Saran Wrap & let it sit for like 30 mins

3715 2018-08-06 17:28:37 #CBC Why don't we make oil pipelines out of plastic straws since plastic straws last "forever"?
3716 2018-08-06 17:28:33 Plenty of oil based products in tyres, tarmac.... EVs crash as much as regular cars. Problem is driving standards and #vehicleobesity
3717 2018-08-06 17:28:30 Yup. The Internet has has seen a new proliferation in snake oil salesmen (there's one in the Whitehorse) and it's time we re-aligned and cut the crap. If it cannot be proven to work, it doesn't work.
3718 2018-08-06 17:28:24 That Duncan Mightys line in 'lover lover'... 'if I break your heart na oil spillage' .... strong line meehn

3721 2018-08-06 17:28:11 Reminder: Alex Jones doesn't believe the conspiracy theories he spouts. It's all just to get people to buy his dick pills.

He is a snake oil salesman and a conman.
3722 2018-08-06 17:28:06 All the more reason to approve the energy east pipeline and stop importing oil from repressive states.
3723 2018-08-06 17:28:06 @JustinTrudeau Just my humble opinion as a Canadian human rights activist: Canada should consider responding to Saudi Arabia "freezing all new trade" with  Canada, by freezing new overseas crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia and procuring crude oil from other countries.
3724 2018-08-06 17:28:05 You people should have had your entire country nuked and paved over after Sept. 11th.
But -- oil.

Saudi's encore will be destroying Iran and splitting the spoils of the Middle East w Israel.
3725 2018-08-06 17:28:04 At least we're moving in the right direction on that issue.
3726 2018-08-06 17:27:59 Fam, medical jobs, oil and gas, etc. Nigerians are everywhere

3728 2018-08-06 17:27:46 all farmers will be soon stop planting crops. If you steal their land they will dump fertilizer and oil all over the land.
3729 2018-08-06 17:27:41 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
3730 2018-08-06 17:27:41 For the longest time I honestly thought tea tree oil was actually spelled tetri oil
3731 2018-08-06 17:27:35 We Saudi should support all Canadians asking to implement Sharia laws in Canadian's judiciary system!! Muslims of Canada specially in Montreal are opposed by such a secular regime!! And they should have access to the oil and forest wealth of the nation!!
3732 2018-08-06 17:27:33 But doesn’t freeze selling oil to Quebec.
3733 2018-08-06 17:27:24 Oil money must be flowing.
3734 2018-08-06 17:27:09 “just put coconut oil on it” Twitter is not my fave.
3735 2018-08-06 17:27:05 i hate getting my oil changed because they ALWAYS try to upsell me some bullshit
3736 2018-08-06 17:26:50 Nop, motor oil.
3737 2018-08-06 17:26:33 coba pake baby oil masukin di dalam telinga kamu trs congkel pake korek kuping besi itu, mempan itu
3738 2018-08-06 17:26:31 That would be motor oil. I had to check that the automotive Bay at work was on process and I got oil on my pants
3739 2018-08-06 17:26:30 Cleansing oil nya yg kayak gimana ya? Belum punya nih wkwk
3740 2018-08-06 17:26:27 Yeah don’t do it especially if you’re going blonde you’ll want as much of your natural oil as ya can and they’re already washing it so eff it
3741 2018-08-06 17:26:26 They have the same effect to the oil company, no? 
 
For each barrel of oil pumped, the oil company has to give a % to the state.  And the state can do whatever it wants with that money. 
 
Maybe I'm just being dense, but I don't really see the difference.
3742 2018-08-06 17:26:26 I bet you trundl doesn’t understand the energy economy of the world, the differences between coal, natural gas, light or heavy oil, etc.
3743 2018-08-06 17:26:19 You make reference to the North American pizza. It’s ok in a pinch, and for the most part we’ve grown to accept this lesser form of pizza pie. But there is nothing like a freshly made Italian pizza. Fresh tomato sauce, fresh olive oil, fresh basil, om nom nom nom.
3744 2018-08-06 17:26:15 Gotta get a oil change and get new tires 
3745 2018-08-06 17:26:14 Pretty sure our government, regardless of party, does not “buy oil” from the Saudis. Rather it is private corps who do. Check with them perhaps?  I’m not fond of government interfering too much in private enterprise.
3746 2018-08-06 17:26:12 You’d think it would be easier with all those “lax” gun laws.
3747 2018-08-06 17:26:10 They are showing the utter contempt they have for Trudeau and this government.  Saudi Arabia just basically bitch slapped him.  Will Trudeau really bow down and kiss their keesters now by continuing to buy their oil?  My bet is yes.
3748 2018-08-06 17:26:08 Getting confused after seeing the price of vegetable oils are almost sold at the price of petrochemicals. But the formers say they can't sum up the simple math as the oil price and the the raw material price  couldn't match. Is there any conspiracy behind this
3749 2018-08-06 17:26:02 Are you studied jayant Agro, castor oil producer looks interesting
3750 2018-08-06 17:26:02 I agree :)
3751 2018-08-06 17:25:59 lol it's time to get your hands dirty like i did and it turned out pretty well tbh i made a clique flag from my old black tshirt and a Cadmium Yellow Pale Hue oil colour code 8 and holy crap doesn't it look fabulous on my wall 
3752 2018-08-06 17:25:44 Who is this Ray Ray guy yall speak of? This pastor who beat a murder charge and dyed his hairline in the same oil based paint Aubrey Graham put on his face. You say he played football? 
He was hall of fame good? 
He wore black paint around his eyes? 
3753 2018-08-06 17:25:43 We have our own oil as it happens. #UKOG
3754 2018-08-06 17:25:42  no it’s not ! It’s one of everything ! Except shampoo and oil
3755 2018-08-06 17:25:40 Cuz a bitch needs oil and I’m not paying $50 for it these niggas got me fucked all the way up
3756 2018-08-06 17:25:39 An Independent Scotland with control of its oil resources from outset, would not have been in same position during oil slump & banking crisis. They were products of the Union, not Scotland
3757 2018-08-06 17:25:37 How long until you start getting that sweet oil money?

Please eat some seal for me.
3758 2018-08-06 17:25:34 Hey @freshlyaddicted I need you to teach me how to change my own oil and tires. TYSM
3759 2018-08-06 17:25:25 Canada should immediately stop buying Saudi oil. Too bad there isn’t a eastern pipeline that could ship Alberta crude to QC and the Atlantic provinces.
3760 2018-08-06 17:25:16 Or when you get a oil change and they always recommend changing your cabin air filter even tho I did the previous visit! 
3761 2018-08-06 17:25:14 All the more reason for the West to go sustainable and decrease our oil dependency on the Middle East to nothing. Starve "the Kingdom" of their money.
3762 2018-08-06 17:25:14 Yes I don't like shorting oil due to geo-political events going on. No swing shorts for me in oil. Strictly only swings in dips on oil long. However intraday in and out moves yes I do short stop in place and take a shot. Was a 20 cent move in and out. 20 cents futures add up
3763 2018-08-06 17:25:04 "EU blocking" is a joke. Even after the #IranDeal most major companies stayed away from Iran. The EU is just giving mullahs empty promises to secure oil and gas concessions for the future. Otherwise any major company should be stupid to risk US penalties deal w/collapsing tyranny
3764 2018-08-06 17:24:54 Alex Jones is a snake oil salesman.  By his own admission, he's an entertainer.  He is not brave, he's a conman.
3765 2018-08-06 17:24:52 He's the one who built Lucas Oil Stadium, he has a hospital to his name. He's a legend in Indy, the best QB ever there. What I'm trying to say is that people can't discredit him as a Bronco just because of his time in Indy.
3766 2018-08-06 17:24:52 งั้นมาหาสิ จะได้บอกว่าดีใจแค่ไหน
3767 2018-08-06 17:24:51 Pls ask ur indian friend @narendramodi also to not buy oil from Iran, how iran has insulted India once @BarackObama allowed it to export oil to other countries and   other trade n money transfer facilities, they ask india who helped them in their bad times to pay in USD n upfront
3768 2018-08-06 17:24:47 I don’t nor have I ever smoked pot and I don’t think it should be illegal.
Set them free as long as they don’t have any gun charges!

3774 2018-08-06 17:24:03 Hey @oliveosun whatchu say about an oil change on High Ceilings? I barely understood what you said yet somehow I like that line for some reason.
3775 2018-08-06 17:24:01 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money  makes me wonder if  Ghana is selling coconut oil.
3776 2018-08-06 17:23:58 Gun oil.
3777 2018-08-06 17:23:56 He will not be Governor of Kansas. The good people of Kansas know a mafia boss/crime syndicate when they see one and they're not interested. They will elect your buddy's opponent because they're decent people who don't want any of the snake oil you're peddling.
3778 2018-08-06 17:23:55 First was after Indira Gandhi's return in early 80s & Shourie filed an expose on Kuo Oil Scam related to Sanjay Gandhi & Indian Express management shivered. Then Shourie used Parliamentary forum to expose. Later in mid 90s was related to power struggle when Goenka was unwell
3779 2018-08-06 17:23:52 About to get a oil change and get my nails done. Probably go out to eat by myself 
3780 2018-08-06 17:23:51 Is this a good thing? Probably not. 
Exxon-Mobil are bad news. 

If reserves are controlled, operational and logistically by PAK then yes, but American involvement no. 

The US just love their oil and will stop at nothing to exploit.
3781 2018-08-06 17:23:50 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia reaches
its maximum level of oil production, and after
I think there will be a problem.
3782 2018-08-06 17:23:48 Over how many decades do you propose we phase the return of Scottish oil?
3783 2018-08-06 17:23:42 Pretty immature and unprofessional for @Jelurida to comment on this don’t you have followers to defend you, probably not after that false accusation article(snake oil)
About Apollo!
3784 2018-08-06 17:23:39 The Trump administration will consider granting partial exceptions from oil sanctions for some countries as the U.S. prepares to reimpose a wave of non-oil sanctions against the nation. #USA #Iran #Sanctions #Trump
3785 2018-08-06 17:23:38 I always wonder why guns insist on traveling to places where they're not welcome to commit their mayhem. Why not just stay at home and do it?
3786 2018-08-06 17:23:24 Standard Oil was a private company. Thing is, when a private company obtains monopoly privileges, they become subject to anti-trust regulations that defend the public’s interest.

We cannot allow monopolies to censor dissident ideas.
3787 2018-08-06 17:23:15 Good riddance. We should use this opportunity to wean ourselves from this retrograde terrorist nation. It will hurt us but we will survive, them without people buying their oil not so much. Fuck Saudi Arabia in case I wasn't clear.
3788 2018-08-06 17:23:04 Got my oil changed. Been meaning to do that for a few days. Next thing to do on the car is price tires at few other places.
3789 2018-08-06 17:23:04 Tea tree oil shampoo has changed my life. 10/10 recommend!!
3790 2018-08-06 17:22:57 i’m trying to be independent and get an oil change in my car all by myself, but so far i’ve cried twice, called my dad to complain, and told myself i was gonna steal someone else’s car so i can get out of here...
3791 2018-08-06 17:22:56 Happily, member countries are introducing blocks to the US that will stop this maniac from further cosying up to #Russia. #Iran should know that #Trumpanzee is acting on #Putins request. #Putin does not want #Iran in the oil market.
3792 2018-08-06 17:22:46 Inside a storage container for gas/oil?
3793 2018-08-06 17:22:45 oilちゃん、おやすみ(^^)
早く寝ろよー！笑
3794 2018-08-06 17:22:43 Plus we have a lot of oil we could use in this country. And there are many other oild producers.
3795 2018-08-06 17:22:32 My grandmother just put oil in my hair and gave me a head massage. Fuck, this is sorcery. I'm seeing stars..
3796 2018-08-06 17:22:28 So what you saying is:you gonna stop the flow of oil?I love it when you guys joke around, we can take your oil without paying a single red penny, wake up and smell your camel this is the USA
3797 2018-08-06 17:22:20 But that’s simply not true or Illinois would have less crime gun traces in Chicago than from Indiana.
3798 2018-08-06 17:22:11 Such a martyr, that lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist. #magats
3799 2018-08-06 17:22:03 I spray lavender oil in house to control fleaa...
3800 2018-08-06 17:22:02 Two words saving lives **today** in 2018: argan oil #4C #LOC
3801 2018-08-06 17:22:00 That looks like it's a lot harder to clean up than a little mud. Is it hard to get rid of all the oil spots?
3802 2018-08-06 17:21:54 Why do I feel like getting my oil changed is a waste of money? It really ain’t but it damn sure feels like it 
3803 2018-08-06 17:21:54 I literally use coconut oil for everything, it’s life
3804 2018-08-06 17:21:39 i’m fina do a hot oil treatment.. i need one
3805 2018-08-06 17:21:37 When the oil runs out so will third egos. Arabs are some of the most uneducated and fickle people to ever walk this earth. You guys need those universities more than anyone else to bring your country into the 21st century.  #primates
3806 2018-08-06 17:21:35 Y'all ever wonder if the Greeks in like 300BCE used olive oil as lube? Like what if it was someone's job to provide it when they had an orgy at their place?
3807 2018-08-06 17:21:24 ありがとうございます…！
3808 2018-08-06 17:21:22 It's because we jail people for pot possession for decades. We need more beds in prison for those pot smokers.

3810 2018-08-06 17:20:52 Is that code for gay? 
Not that there’s anything wrong with that! 
3811 2018-08-06 17:20:37 i need more bughead fanfic lmao so hmu!! i’ve read : daddy, pieces of my heart, for a good time call betty, and oil and sugar
3812 2018-08-06 17:20:33 Look at the history of smuggling into this country. Prohibition and the War of Drugs have been total failures.
3813 2018-08-06 17:20:27 It's really hard when that country sits on 20% of the world's oil reserves. Get your point here, but somehow SA won the world geography lottery when it came to resources. Social values not so much...
3814 2018-08-06 17:20:23 Iran threatens to shut down the Strait of Hormuz. #Breaking #oil #news #bloomberg
3815 2018-08-06 17:20:21 They gotta clean up the mess in Crude Oil.   Got way to many people on 1 side of that trade too.
3816 2018-08-06 17:20:20 we have oil and the rhinos that just died need market. i wish its Korea that had invited him tujue vile ya kutengeneza missiles. uganda is becoming too much

3818 2018-08-06 17:19:45 Buy Calgary not Saudi oil!
3819 2018-08-06 17:19:44 We wouldn’t even need that if we kept violent criminals in jail.
Not sure why it’s ok to let violent people out of jail ‘just as long as they can’t buy a gun’???
3820 2018-08-06 17:19:42 have you tried some clove oil?
3821 2018-08-06 17:19:31 Everytime I get an oil change I’m always surprised by the price like why I had to get the difficult car 
3822 2018-08-06 17:19:22 Just my humble opinion as a Canadian human rights activist: Canada should consider responding to Saudi Arabia "freezing all new trade" with Canada, by freezing new overseas crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia.
3823 2018-08-06 17:19:16 ควรดีใจมั้ยครับ..
3824 2018-08-06 17:19:04 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
3825 2018-08-06 17:19:01 They'll do it right after finishing that fish oil they bought.
3826 2018-08-06 17:19:00 maybe sebab kita basuh oil tu cam tak bersih sangat. you boleh try guna microfiber cloth waktu nak cuci muka tu. dia cam lebih bersih
3827 2018-08-06 17:18:52 Can you drill for oil up there?
3828 2018-08-06 17:18:47 Good time to remind the world that Canada's GDP in 2016 was ~ 1.5 trillion USD while KSA's GDP was ~ 650 billion USD

Canada's economy is over twice the size of Saudi Arabia's and is more diversified comparatively. 

The only thing KSA sells is oil & we have plenty of that.
3829 2018-08-06 17:18:36 Osteen is one in a long line of snake oil salesmen preaching the gospel of prosperity. He convinces his followers that it is in their best interest to give him money. Start taxing churches!
3830 2018-08-06 17:18:30 Free mila manjan expire hai soyabean oil ke saath
3831 2018-08-06 17:18:28 Donald Trump will start a nuclear conflict. Oil is Iran's livelihood and Iran will get the support of Russia in any conflict against the U.S.
3832 2018-08-06 17:18:18 Perhaps.
3833 2018-08-06 17:18:14 DKW but I'm craving cucumbers so bad today. Oh, what I would do for cucumbers with oil & vinegar lol.
3834 2018-08-06 17:18:13 When scots leave UK Westminster will have to choose between taking on the chin and behaving responsibly,,or fighting tooth and nail to keep scots resources.I know already which they will choose.
They weny to Iraq for oil so wont let scots walk away with THIERS
3835 2018-08-06 17:18:11 @realDonaldTrump tweets are turning out to be mostly #fakenews. The @POTUS is turning into a fucking embarrassment around the world. North Korea is still building nukes. Price oil is not going down and US debt is still climbing and #China is not backing down.
3836 2018-08-06 17:18:10 1/2 Flashback: $WLL purchased Kodiak in 2014 for $6B when WTI was $100.
Kodiak was 167 mmboe proved, 34 mboepd, 181k net acres
$QEP Williston is 147 mmboe proved, 46.5 mboepd, 97k net acres
Assuming $50k per boepd (due to higher oil price), WLL paid $23.7k per prod adj acre
3837 2018-08-06 17:18:09 Hay we are having a bit of fun here. Don't spoil it because I tell you lots of us in England and Wales did not see any of the Massive Oil wealth that was supposed to come out of the North Sea. In fact Governments own figures show the gap between Rich & Poor is gettng ever wider.
3838 2018-08-06 17:18:01 Citronella oil. 10 drops in water plant sprayer shake well and spray. Harmless to animals.
3839 2018-08-06 17:17:58 But you know where there is oil there is a country waiting to be given freedom by the US
3840 2018-08-06 17:17:57 What will happen with oil prices, my little economist?
3841 2018-08-06 17:17:51 ....Just because Gelatin isnt vegetarian. It's made from bones, tendons etc. Of animals. There are Fish Oil omega 3 capsules which I don't even understand why people take. Plant Based Omega 3 has worked for me, and I've been Vegan for 3 years. So make sure the Omega 3 is Veggie
3842 2018-08-06 17:17:44 Yar Kano ceh ni fah
3843 2018-08-06 17:17:39 That's double speak for how to capture the new oil for my own vested crony interests and that of my pals in PN and govt. Your Aadhaar thoughts destroyed the nation. Please stop already.
3844 2018-08-06 17:17:34 Facts: Ondo state is one of the Oil Producing states in Nigeria, the Oil producing communities are Ilaje and Ese-Odo Local Government in Ondo state. Ondo State is part of the Niger Delta States.
3845 2018-08-06 17:17:30 ما انت عارف 
3846 2018-08-06 17:17:28 Since it hasn’t rained in awhile there is oil on the highways which can make it very slippery just after it starts raining. Keep at least 12 car lengths when on freeways.
3847 2018-08-06 17:17:25 idk if I should buy my sister the farsali oil for her bday or like something else

3851 2018-08-06 17:16:57 CA has become arrogant to the point that it thinks the constitution doesn’t apply to them.
3852 2018-08-06 17:16:52 I like adding coconut oil (1tbs) to dehydrated dinners.  Solid at room temp, adds flavor, adds calories.
3853 2018-08-06 17:16:46 If scots don't leave UK before Brexit Westminster will force scots to stay,,and bearing in mind HALF OF SCOTS VOTERS WANT OUT OF UK then right there is a recipe for civil unrest.WM will make enemies of scots to keep our oil
3854 2018-08-06 17:16:40 Rweminds me of Kentucky Fried Movie, Catholic High School Girls in Trouble, Spanish Inquistion scene with Midget Whipping Chick on Rack for the Masked Executioner giving Witches hot Oil Massages & Wax jobs & peels, And or Chick dress like Cavegirl slaping horses ass with a pie
3855 2018-08-06 17:16:35 I need me some jojoba oil this country better have it
3856 2018-08-06 17:16:30 Amin Otunba
3857 2018-08-06 17:16:29 Now treat our one and only EARTH with the same respect you give the gay community. Being progressive is great, but pushing for more filthy oil production and buying pipelines with OUR $ is a hypocrisy beyond belief.
3858 2018-08-06 17:16:29 It's all laughs till you have no more blood oil to heat your homes. Why does the east love Saudi oil is it the way they shown the world how to treat women or maybe it's the millions suffering from Saudi foreign policies.
3859 2018-08-06 17:16:17 @PressTV @XHNews I read now statement of EU by German Foreign affairs (Auswärtiges Amt) Total protection of companies doing legal business with Iran, include 'Oil Business'  blocking of USA sanctions. Reason, they want to stand with the #IranDeal and for own & world security.
3860 2018-08-06 17:16:15 うん。片付けってあたま使うから、しんどいときにはできない……(TT)
てかワシが言うのもアレだけど早く寝なさいよ〜(-ω-)笑

ワシは歯が痛くて眠れんのじゃ(´；ω；｀)
3861 2018-08-06 17:16:11 I been waiting on an oil change for over an hour 
3862 2018-08-06 17:16:01 I live in SD.  It's beautiful with a nice liberal-conservative mix, not too extreme on either end.
3863 2018-08-06 17:16:00 "Yaaawn"...Interest in our oil? Ama that was decided a long time ago?
3864 2018-08-06 17:15:54 Maiden were my first gig - an orgy of hammer-ons, patchouli oil and beer farts.
3865 2018-08-06 17:15:46 You think our national border is so much more difficult to cross? If the demand direction reversed, we'd have guns flowing inward. My source is the study of economics.
3866 2018-08-06 17:15:45 I wonder where all the Massive Oil wealth went? I know I did not see any in fact the Governments own figures have shown that since UK has been in the EU. The gap between Rich and poor has got ever wider.
3867 2018-08-06 17:15:38 Thanks for posting all you do. Very interesting method. In my previous readings of your posts you have mentioned never shorting oil. Does this short reflect your conviction on this trade? Thanks!!
3868 2018-08-06 17:15:32 scots need EU to protect us from all you "Its not your oil anyway" brigade.
Sad we need protecting from our 300 year union partner but that's the reality for scots.
3869 2018-08-06 17:15:29 Actually, if Canada did not have its needle stuck on #pipelines there is tremendous employment potential in #renewables. @IRONandEARTH showed this when oil prices went belly up.  Check their twitter feed.
3870 2018-08-06 17:15:21 I never understood why #iran a country fulfilled with oil and minerals is so obsessed with its #nuclear program ? @JZarif
3871 2018-08-06 17:15:12 Ahh , ponele que si , vamos a festejar y sonreír que no tengo que cargarle más gas oil a la cosechadora .
3872 2018-08-06 17:15:05 We have to get that oil somehow
3873 2018-08-06 17:15:04 Gotta go to West Philly tomorrow for an oil change. Ima ask them how much for a paint job on my trunk. Those scratches look nasty
3874 2018-08-06 17:14:48 Already answered, if you think canny scots will bet their future pensions on a volatile resource like oil then you have failed to understand the risks. Remember it was priced $10 pb in 1996?
3875 2018-08-06 17:14:45 I’ve learned to love bulletproof matcha! Used to think the oil was gross but now it’s sooo good
3876 2018-08-06 17:14:42 Takat ni aku guna safi je semua product kecuali double cleansing & serum. Sebab safi tadok oil cleanser tu and serum dia macam dok jadi nge aku. So muka mu ni bagi rest dulu kot. Meroh dia teruk ke

3878 2018-08-06 17:14:35 More Californians are waking up. Relatives in Pacifica & Livermore are voting for Conservatives now! They are fed up. Both my brother in laws in Livermore are new ccw holders.
3879 2018-08-06 17:14:14 Breadstick with olive oil, salt and pepper. Or plain breadstick? It’s important.
3880 2018-08-06 17:14:13 WOOT WOOT! 30 days ago my triglycerides were at 1195 (with 80mg Atorvastatin nightly). Switched from Bud Light 6.6g carbs to Mich Ultra 2.9g carbs, stopped eating oranges, started Carlson’s fish oil + garlic extract. Dr called today triglycerides 265!
3881 2018-08-06 17:14:13 Washed
Oil changed  
Gas tank on full  
Baby girl is good 
3882 2018-08-06 17:14:07 No barrier to moving guns from other cities & states. We know it's being done, from loose states to strict.
I don't think we have a major problem with guns being smuggled to the US.  But if you have a reference to show it is, let me know.
3883 2018-08-06 17:14:02 Private sector companies can do whatever they want to hateful conspiracy theory selling snake oil salesman.
3884 2018-08-06 17:13:58 GDP better than Saudi. Also our economy is more Diversified unlike Saudi Arabia which basically exports oil and 9/11 terrorists
3885 2018-08-06 17:13:45 I guess the InfoWars have been lost. Who would have guessed that a snake oil salesmen wouldn't be able to win the war of information against literal and observable reality?

#infowars
3886 2018-08-06 17:13:45 Too bad. The Constitution applies nationwide, and you're about to have some freedom brought to you.
3887 2018-08-06 17:13:40 It was so unnecessary...why the oil tank didn't stop in time...there was no problem to do so..tragic

3890 2018-08-06 17:13:17 What about making your own? You could control the amount of oil that goes into it better.
3891 2018-08-06 17:13:15 What's the best oil for a diesel engine?
3892 2018-08-06 17:12:57 Not sure how much of a return you'll get for weenies who go to Arthur Ave and talk about buying "spiced olive oil" like they went on a big trip
3893 2018-08-06 17:12:40 ab itna bhi budha nahi hon mein  ... ju bhi hey oil talash kar k dein ap ... sirf batain na karo waddi geologist saheba 
3894 2018-08-06 17:12:34 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3895 2018-08-06 17:12:31 Isn't coconut oil bad for vaginas in general? 
3896 2018-08-06 17:12:22 The deal ought to be implemented in action to prevail good governance  and democracy to save the young oil rich tiny republic.
3897 2018-08-06 17:12:19 the sanctions are to drive the cost of oil up so tRump and his buddies can do some more insider trading.
3898 2018-08-06 17:12:16 You've got a live one there, bet she thinks they'll be keeping the oil revenues as well !
3899 2018-08-06 17:12:09 Looking forward to it. I absolutely love oil. Thanks Saira.
3900 2018-08-06 17:12:07 Given your record on environmental issues, you have no room to criticize what is in fact the most green focused state in America.. how many parks have you reclaimed for oil drilling Donnie?
3901 2018-08-06 17:11:57 ‘Impress yourself! @Tesla’s technology is elite across the board!! Im impressed with @elonmusk’s ideas that close down those who are unwilling to turn their heads to the magnitude of evidence of Tesla’s progress!Tesla factories means more carsZero gas Zero oil & Zero emissions!
3902 2018-08-06 17:11:57 That weird feeling when 3 spanish guys whistle at you. I guess they just want some of that Oil money!
3903 2018-08-06 17:11:35 Not saying I'm a rebel but I burnt the midnight oil at 11:00pm.
3904 2018-08-06 17:11:23 Ok show me and everyone listening ukcs oil production figures for the next 20 yrs? What is it now and what will be in 20 yrs? Lifting costs in the NS are much higher than rest of world! Decommissioning liabilities £30bn. Why are oil companies planning to leave or invest elsewhere
3905 2018-08-06 17:11:19 Fort Lewis McChord is in Tacoma/Seattle....I would of thought they’d be more conservative
3906 2018-08-06 17:11:15 Just a humble Jesus disciple. - why do people follow these preacher grifters?  These  snake oil salesmen have the greatest scam ever devised    They ramble on ,quoting scripture, & in return you get to give them big $   If u don’t- you’re going to hell.  Amen
3907 2018-08-06 17:11:11 Well. Stop buying oil from them and use our own! Quit supporting their financial gains!
3908 2018-08-06 17:11:07 That's ok, I'm an old fashioned conservative, semi platform on immigration etc, makes me nuts.
3909 2018-08-06 17:11:06 Where do we stand with the Iranian people- here in the safety of our country? 
What about the Syrian people? Do they deserve our concern, too?
Get over this false caring.
It us all about OIL RIGHTS and Warm Water Ports.
3910 2018-08-06 17:11:04 It's mutual.
3911 2018-08-06 17:10:59 N that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil .
3912 2018-08-06 17:10:54 We will run out only if we use them#as if they are limitless. We're the wisest of God's creation. We're smart enough to figure out how to  live on this vast planet without plundering her. We're doing that right now. Accept that Oil isn't the future. That's a start.
3913 2018-08-06 17:10:46 Regardless of the terminology, there is one thing in common: Both ND and AK have extra $ in a fund due to oil production. 
 
In AK, they give a portion of the fund's earnings back to the people of the state each year and they reinvest the rest. 
 
I like that idea.
3914 2018-08-06 17:10:34 Why does Dan Bejar sound exactly like a tricky goblin slathered in tea tree oil who stands poised at the opening of cave demanding passersby to explain the deeper themes of 'Herzog' before letting them go
3915 2018-08-06 17:10:32 I played those 2 on my PC, pretty good. Also lol look up the Japanese version of Oil Man from powered up.
3916 2018-08-06 17:10:23 Hhhhhhhh China and Europe refused USA sanctions on Iran and oil prices will down to 55-60$
3917 2018-08-06 17:10:21 That should oil the parts! :-)

3920 2018-08-06 17:10:16 CA is more diverse than most people realize.  Although, the conservatives here are far more liberal on social issues (for the most part) than in red states.
3921 2018-08-06 17:10:11 My old employer Transocean  problem was, there wasn’t enough birds to soak up all the oil!!!

3924 2018-08-06 17:10:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
3925 2018-08-06 17:09:54 That's crazy talk, Bob. We need that Saudi oil to keep the eastern refineries going.
3926 2018-08-06 17:09:51 Someone had a breakfast this morning which my parents patronised.

I bite into a fishcake and oil runs down my chin.

Momz: Na girl, Yuh have to sap that with a tissue.

Daddy: Yuh hadda wring it to get out that oil.

Me: 
3927 2018-08-06 17:09:49 Damn bro, that’s how Jiffy gets you telling you about 6 problems but you came their just to get a oil change. Take it back they should give you some type of discount on the service

3929 2018-08-06 17:09:35 In Middle East oil is nationalised but no problem. The problem with Venezuela is the violation of human. There is no democracy there
3930 2018-08-06 17:09:30 Usualy oil !
3931 2018-08-06 17:09:29 Olbas oil in a big bowl of very hot water and inhale as much as you can take it!

3933 2018-08-06 17:09:22 @NTB just took 2 and a half hours for an oil change. Thanks for wasting half my day, who should I invoice for my wasted time? Corporate or your multiple mechanics that I could see sitting around #unbelievable
3934 2018-08-06 17:09:22 Cure? Epilepsy and cancer? From hemp oil? Fuck this devious snake oil shit I'm out.
3935 2018-08-06 17:09:21 I believe you that you've heard Democrats say that. I've also heard Hillary Clinton say that a cartoon frog is a white supremacist, so forgive me if I suspect that you are the one selling snake oil.
3936 2018-08-06 17:09:21 Waiting for an oil change is so boring
3937 2018-08-06 17:09:20 With Oil and valuable metals,  Iran can do away with US.
3938 2018-08-06 17:09:18 This weather is banging. Come home from work at 5 Speedos on at 10 past. Carrot oil on. Bang. Dale Winton. #summerholidays #britishsummertime #supermarket

3940 2018-08-06 17:09:06 @itvnews 12 earthquakes in 3 months, but lets not let that get in the way of profits by drilling for oil or fracking. We're going to have more and more of these in the coming years, but the government will never care because ££££££.
3941 2018-08-06 17:09:05 Oil is fluid.
3942 2018-08-06 17:09:05 Nm I see it. Ontario and Quebec would still much rather buy Oil from them than Alberta. Crazy
3943 2018-08-06 17:09:01 ลืมก็ได้ ออยเป็นเด็กดีเชื่อฟัง
3944 2018-08-06 17:08:53 We don’t, actually. We’re just making the decision that it’s easier to just use their oil rather than go through the trouble of finding other ways. Once the oil runs out, we’ll be forced to deal w it.
3945 2018-08-06 17:08:52 うおおんもう二時か。あとちょいー
3946 2018-08-06 17:08:51 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3947 2018-08-06 17:08:46 Snake oil salesman extraordinaire, now we have technology to ban them? Weird thought.
3948 2018-08-06 17:08:44 I have family in SD, they say its pretty much ok there. Suppose because it's a Navy town?
3949 2018-08-06 17:08:39 กูเหมือนเป็นคนที่มีความอดทนสูงมากสินะ
3950 2018-08-06 17:08:37 Lucky for him NM has made his country somewhat irrelevant and to orchestrate taking him out is probably a headache as the alternatives to him are unclear at best....while the US remains flooded with oil and weed @NicolasMaduro  can keep blabbing on.....
3951 2018-08-06 17:08:31 China and Europe refused USA sanctions on Iran and oil prices will down to 55-60$
3952 2018-08-06 17:08:26 Long hair is great until you put oil all over your body and you feel like there’s hair sticking to you constantly
3953 2018-08-06 17:08:24 I would actually do the right thing if I knew proper way to dispose used cooking oil or bacon grease I’m happy to take suggestion 
3954 2018-08-06 17:08:20 Palm Oil, no thanks.
3955 2018-08-06 17:08:20 We're at 1 week taking hemp oil twice a day. I feel mentally better than I have in years. Even if it's just placebo, I will TAKE IT.
3956 2018-08-06 17:07:59 the astigmatism is so real in those oil paintings fjfkfjfkfkf
3957 2018-08-06 17:07:58 Good Afternoon Sherry And Ladies! Oil never sleeps for Sherry! Enjoy your day all!

3960 2018-08-06 17:07:44 As the president says Putin is a good guy.... 

You are a joke Mr. Infowhores! 

You pedal pills that will make you invincible or increase dick sizes or makes you gain more muscle mass... 

You are a snake oil salesmen that also perpetuates hate and paranoia!
3961 2018-08-06 17:07:40 Still going with the Matrix memes?
He spouts nonsense (e.g. anything he’s ever said about every mass shooting is delusional idiocy). 
Plenty of places to get the garbage RW perspective on things without being fed conspiracies & snake oil supplements & brain pills
3962 2018-08-06 17:07:39 It's during that peak in the 80s that the Thatcher government dropped top rate of tax from 60p to 40p on £. That's the type of tax cut I'm saying NS oil revenue funded. And what did they do with it? They bought property, and bid up house prices.
3963 2018-08-06 17:07:39 The only law we need is a good NICS check, that's it. No complex hardware bans, no endless permitting, no registration. If I have a pistol with a barrel shroud in NJ, I could get 5 to 10, now isn't that stupid?
3964 2018-08-06 17:07:34 Did you reed the GP/Goop profile in nytmag? It made my brain hurt... then i took some b12 and fish oil and felt much better
3965 2018-08-06 17:07:26 Those back a$$ed women hating totalitarian a holes can keep their oil .we shouldnt be dealling with a country that supports terrorists
3966 2018-08-06 17:07:26 If you can find grass fed butter and mct oil it's definitely worth doing it yourself. My wife doesn't add any sweetener but I throw some liquid stevia in mine.
3967 2018-08-06 17:07:20 Even better, build the Energy East Pipeline & stop buying their oil.
3968 2018-08-06 17:07:15 10 bug bites from yesterday’s party.... ugh tea tree oil, do your magic
3969 2018-08-06 17:07:14 Actually Saudi gives oil in return for services an goods. So, even though I don't support Saudi kings and princes in general, in this case Saudis are not taking anything for free at all.
3970 2018-08-06 17:07:11 Béatrice BEDEUR paints these wonderful landscapes, all oil on canvas. :)
3971 2018-08-06 17:07:11 Talaga bang makati sa eyelids yung castor oil?
3972 2018-08-06 17:07:07 Hello! This price is for a conventional oil change.
3973 2018-08-06 17:07:03 Give it colors water colors let it bleed off the lines and not look perfect then send it to an art gallery I see some abstract art in that! Use oil paint pen and paste also you might be the next best artist
3974 2018-08-06 17:06:56 I don't care if AJ peddles his snake oil, I have the choice not to buy it. 

But I do care when he uses his various platforms to target groups he doesn't like. Those people don't end up w/ a choice when his fans feel empowered to act on their hatred.
3975 2018-08-06 17:06:42 Everyone needs to put the fucking coconut oil DOWN
3976 2018-08-06 17:06:41 They have every right to create their own app to broadcast, and they have PLENTY of money to hire a development team with all that unscientific snake oil they sell. 

They make their own app; they make their own rules; no “censorship,” (since that’s not what this is anyway)
3977 2018-08-06 17:06:41 Exactly. That’s why we need to stop buying their oil as long as they’re acting like monsters to our fellow humans. Because they need our money, they might be forced to be less atrocious. It’s up to us to take a stand-they won’t. They’re happy w the current situation.
3978 2018-08-06 17:06:36 Man, I should be @ the beach rn rubbing tanning oil on shorty cheeks. The life of a hard working man is tough but someone's gotta do it.
3979 2018-08-06 17:06:26 Quebec buy Billions of $ worth of oil from Saudis.
3980 2018-08-06 17:06:22 อันไหนแว๊ เยอะเหลือเกินช่วงนี้
3981 2018-08-06 17:06:19 We make it ourselves. We bought the bulletproof branded MCT oil though.  I don't normally drink it during the week cuz I wake up about 12 mins before I have to be out the door.
3982 2018-08-06 17:06:19 Oh, oh, oh. I know the answer to this question. The East can get oil from Alberta?!?!?!?
3983 2018-08-06 17:06:19 How does spending shit loads of money - and significantly more than all your rivals - equate to a “well-run club”? Especially when that spend has all come from sovereign wealth of an oil state & not in anyway self-generated?
3984 2018-08-06 17:06:17 Oil change & tires rotation on black beauty today. 
3985 2018-08-06 17:06:13 Blair dismisses all these behavioural changes as “insignificant”, and refuses to consider that we could dramatically reduce oil consumption by reducing *consumption* in general. It’s structural, our society is currently designed around individualism & waste, to feed capitalism.
3986 2018-08-06 17:06:10 hamaray area mein exploration tu tab hoi thee jab mein school going thaa ... kia pata ab oil taiyar ho gaiya ho zameen mein yahan bhi 
3987 2018-08-06 17:06:08 Everyone in your country wishes they were here.

Bet you guys are real excited that the US produces more oil than you. We can buy from them or make our own. 

Who will you buy your weapons from? And with what, sand?

Ahahah! What a shitty country!!
3988 2018-08-06 17:06:05 In the 1890’s The Sherman Antitrust Act broke up the big steel companies and the big oil companies. Today Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon are bigger than those companies ever were. Today isn’t the 1890’s.
3989 2018-08-06 17:05:59 Yes, like that, and more. Of course, that's .0005% of streets in the state.

3991 2018-08-06 17:05:29 PDP is just making frivolous comments and allegations to be relevant
How signing $25B DSDP Oil Contract with IOCs resulted in scam

The Minister only commented that he was not involved in d pre-arrangement not alleging that d contract/money was siphoned

Illiteracy is killing PDP
3992 2018-08-06 17:05:27 I spend my whole life covered in engine oil and grease now 
3993 2018-08-06 17:05:20 outline when writing for george soros, no outline when writing for big oil
3994 2018-08-06 17:05:13 And we need their oil
3995 2018-08-06 17:05:00 You did`nt answer my two questions.
Why is it hard for you to admit scots would be be6ter off with 100% of oil revenues?
Why is it hard for you to admit scots are right to want to run thier own country?
You hold very extreme views Christine,you are an extremeist
3996 2018-08-06 17:04:59 Someone recommend a good tanning oil! Ya gurl tryna be Ariana grande tan
3997 2018-08-06 17:04:56 Venezuela has a fascist government that has shredded constitutional law and consolidated its powers to the chief executive. It has state run oil companies that were stolen from private enterprise. That is not America, and scary enough, the only thing that is similar is Donald
3998 2018-08-06 17:04:56 We don’t need their oil. We have more than enough. I believe we’re the biggest exporter of crude oil? Can you imagine what would happen if we just up and left the M.E.? Think Taliban in Afghanistan turned up to 11 throughout the whole region.
3999 2018-08-06 17:04:54 Always suspect of ppl who advocate coconut oil for food...
4000 2018-08-06 17:04:44 I suspect that the argument being made is that unaffordable oil is a good thing for the environment.
4001 2018-08-06 17:04:41 Ladies!!!! Hair growth hacks please? What can grow the hair?

I know fixing weaves helps to grow edges, I heard weed in hair cream works and coconut oil with Shea butter? Please drop your routine
4002 2018-08-06 17:04:37 … If we want to get our economy going… Sell our oil to us at our price… Not world price… We’re giving it away for $30-40 per barrel…Drop the world price… And fire up our economy our transportation system…
4003 2018-08-06 17:04:25 I support most of them.
4004 2018-08-06 17:04:19 Actually, crony capitalism has been a hallmark of Republican Party policies for decades: tax breaks to connected companies (but not to those without connections), subsidies to coal and oil and gas companies, subsidies for farmers and agribusiness. It’s not new.
4005 2018-08-06 17:04:19 Meanwhile Russian oligarchy is probably salivating over thought of taking over US Oil
4006 2018-08-06 17:04:17 FYI, Nestor, poison Ivy, oak and sumac are all "the same" medically as they all have the same devil oil (urushiol). But diff parts of North America are infested with different plants. I'm in a nearly ivy only zone. Others have only oak, but same evil.
4007 2018-08-06 17:04:16 Oddly, my county is also very red. Doesnt help with state laws but I can wear my MAGA hat with no problem.
4008 2018-08-06 17:04:10 Gas prices today are based on "oil prices 2 years" ago or so they claim it has nothing to do with today ..... I always call bullshit
4009 2018-08-06 17:03:59 Can you compare Nigeria with UAE, Saudi Arabia or even countries with no oil like Singapore?  No

4013 2018-08-06 17:03:38 Where will Alex Jones peddle his snake oil supplements and conspiracy theories now?!?!!?!?
4014 2018-08-06 17:03:36 They’ve been interfering in our politics and economy for decades by funding the ecoNazis who have destroyed our oil industry. Our Irony Meter should be exploding right about now....
4015 2018-08-06 17:03:34 All of y’all that can get a $45 or $50 oil change... I can’t stand you.
4016 2018-08-06 17:03:27 Let's not forget that the reason for US involvement in the installation of the Shah (the most corrupt despot to ever walk the face of the earth) was the nationalization of the oil fields by the legitimately elected president.
4017 2018-08-06 17:03:18 Make sure you're wiping down your hearing aids every morning to remove any wax or oil that could build up during the day! #hearingaids #hearing #hearingloss #wax #protip
4018 2018-08-06 17:03:14 My gosh you make it sound like Mexico is all adobe huts and tumbleweeds. They're ranked 15 in GDP, 13 in exports, 8 in oil production. Perfectly capable of standing on their own two feet. But anyone will tell you their political corruption is still pervasive and cancerous.
4019 2018-08-06 17:03:03 It’s women still running off the confidence the man that cheated on them gave them. You need an oil change.
4020 2018-08-06 17:03:01 That and a few other crazy positions, like all of them.
4021 2018-08-06 17:03:00 Your desires are not welcome.
4022 2018-08-06 17:02:58 They treat their citizens like that because they’re immune from criticism from the international community which depends on theit oil.
4023 2018-08-06 17:02:48 @SecretService Then report to Ghana embassy and was told im being scamed this is my husband oil tanker no one got off their ass check out, all they did was switched me over ACS its my husband ship it no scam they were hijacked go talk GENERAL Thompson charge Port Authority Ghana
4024 2018-08-06 17:02:48 Rev. Dr. Opuni, do you know any Mosque that sells anointing oil for two hundred Ghana cedis that you are insisting they must also be taxed if government wants to tax churches?  In fact I am convinced that ALL Christians are saved from critical thinking!!!!
4025 2018-08-06 17:02:34 Challenges like poop & syringes on streets?? And don’t even tell me it isn’t so....I was in the Bay Area last week. Disgusting. But we are going to ban straws? I am glad I have my ccw and love going to the range to stay proficient.

4028 2018-08-06 17:02:28 @y_alibhai  just remind me Yasmin of a country where Islam has brought the people unbridled joy and happiness. Whilst you are at it remind me of one wealthy Islamic country that's not sat on a lake of oil
4029 2018-08-06 17:02:20 lol my dad just yelled at me for not telling him the change oil light lit up in my car, and I told him I thought it was like how he told me to ignore the check engine light and he just yelled at me some more before leaving
4030 2018-08-06 17:02:19 BEWARE of Soybean Oil! I could not have lunch with my family @noodlescompany. They ONLY use Soybean Oil in their booking!  I, like many other people, are allergic to Soy. Good thing I asked first or I would have become extremely ill! #soybeanoil #allergy
4031 2018-08-06 17:02:08 I know.  I'd rather loosen ours a bit, and tighten our neighbors.
4032 2018-08-06 17:02:07 อ่าวนึกว่าเพื่อนเห็นละ
4033 2018-08-06 17:02:03 I think the basis of your argument is correct, but running and screaming in the street to sue Exxon and all the oil companies is not the right way to get it done. It’s just as insane as going to jail for six months for giving somebody a plastic straw.
4034 2018-08-06 17:01:51 A good Black Seed oil is roughly $20 - $30 bux. You can start with that.
4035 2018-08-06 17:01:45 I agree that gasoline prices in isolation might not tell us much but you can include them with other indicators to see trends. However, economists analyze gas and crude oil prices and how they impact the economy, because they are considered indicators, piece of the puzzle.
4036 2018-08-06 17:01:42 กลับนครศรีธรรมราชคับ
4037 2018-08-06 17:01:41 So you claim, and having made the claim, you undermine your own argument, since you admit that guns can cross borders into places where they're not officially welcome.
4038 2018-08-06 17:01:39 Even then you might get it.  :/  I've heard it's best to think of the oil like an invisible grease that you need to get off your skin and tools.
4039 2018-08-06 17:01:36 They believe the #orangeElvis speaks greater truth than the Govt, FBI, NSA, or CIA
He’s a con man performer.
A snake oil seller. 
A rabid evangelistic tent preacher telling them that they can “throw away their crutches,” that up is down, that they are the “elite” & that he cares

4041 2018-08-06 17:01:25 Snake oil salesman. Sad part is half the country bought it. Only Hannity was warning us but they didn’t listen.
Still don’t.
4042 2018-08-06 17:01:24 Talk about how Kenya is corrupt? Kenya is the only country to export and import it's own coffee, to export and import it's own oil and the only country in the world to be colonised twice.

4048 2018-08-06 17:01:04 Treasury is doing good with record borrowing, N13 trillion in 3 years, where is d infrastructure? An economy that is barely coming out of recession is diversifying? Even when d growth is only oil price driven seeing that d manufacturing sector is still down. Un go dey ok las las
4049 2018-08-06 17:01:04 Oh no, how will you sell your snake oil now?
4050 2018-08-06 17:01:03 And the winner is....Arianna Thompson! Congratulations on the free oil change, Arianna! Please check your messages.
4051 2018-08-06 17:01:03 Keep selling your snake oil, that should keep the light on.  Also keep smoking.  I hear it's great for your health!

4068 2018-08-06 17:00:01 I suppose your not aware that Scotland is a major producer of oil. Or aware that we export gas and electricity to the rest of the UK and that without Scotland the lights would indeed go out in much of England. All big industries to a small independent country.

4071 2018-08-06 16:59:59 .@Colts the @IronPigs  have an off day today, and we can Lucas Oil Stadium out of the hotel window! Any chance for a tour today?!
4072 2018-08-06 16:59:58 Ok. I’ve never followed it other than the odd video. I like Ezra’s book, Ethical Oil, but I can’t get behind any radical group as I think they are all nuts. However, Rebel media is hardly an example  of the average Conservative’s beliefs.
4073 2018-08-06 16:59:56 No, the way plantain is fried but instead of regular oil, palm oil is used.

4076 2018-08-06 16:59:52 Jell-O cheesecake doesn't need cooking! I pre-mix the filling with sugar and freeze-dried fruit, and pre-mix the crust. Coconut oil packets instead of butter for crust, which I just melt in water. Works best if you're somewhere cold, so the filling will set quickly.

4088 2018-08-06 16:59:10 @DrGundry Smoke point for MCT oil is only 320 degrees. Carrot Cake Muffins recipe in the PP cookbook says 1/3 c MCT oil or avocado oil. Is it okay to use MCT oil?

4091 2018-08-06 16:58:59 That's the most effective thing I've found. The trick is to *first* ensure that all the oil is gone (and it's more stubborn than moist oils). Hot water opens the pores and allows better penatration so is horrible when first cleansing. Thereafter it is heaven for itch relief.

4094 2018-08-06 16:58:39 The energy East pipeline was to export oil out of the country. Plenty of Alberta oil makes it’s way to Quebec.

4101 2018-08-06 16:58:05 EU (Germany especially) gains from higher crude oil prices
1) they have low energy intensity so does not increase cost much
2) weakens Euro better for exports
3) countries (MENA, Russia) benefiting from higher oil are major importers of EU, German goods. see trade flows

4107 2018-08-06 16:57:38 THIS  right here is why the Saudis are the some of the most ignorant, ill-educated, and backward people in the world. She’s not lying - they really don’t care about research or studies. As long as oil money comes in and they can buy cars and make up, they’ll be happy.
4108 2018-08-06 16:57:35 He saw big oil in court and lost that one too!
4109 2018-08-06 16:57:35 Oh no, how am I going to find out about gay frogs and snake oil that makes me turn red.
4110 2018-08-06 16:57:25 Andy, clearly it is much better for our collective carbon footprint to Import the oil (make it travel further) for all Ruth's and our daily needs, such as phones, cling film, clothes, farming and the supply chain. oh and the frivolous use of cars etc.

4123 2018-08-06 16:55:57 How far back do you go?
Do they need to know which species of sea creature became the oil/gas?
4124 2018-08-06 16:55:56 how is my face both dry AND covered in acne. i thought acne was caused by excess oil. why is this my life !
4125 2018-08-06 16:55:52 I've used olive oil for the purpose on non-absorbent surfaces. Can't remember where I got that tip. I was sceptical but it worked a treat.
4126 2018-08-06 16:55:51 I cry no tears for Alex Jones but I can't say I agree with this. He may be a total buffoon who peddles in made up stories and snake oil supplements but shutting down his channel is a violation of the ideal of free speech. @YouTube should respect the #1stAmendment & undo this
4127 2018-08-06 16:55:27 2 hour wait for an oil change. Rip. :/
4128 2018-08-06 16:55:18 Dependency on oil is a given by all countries. EU nations, to different degrees, are trying to move away from strictly oil and gas energy sources.
Kind of ignorant to say 'not dependent on Russian oil' when all nations get it where they can at the lowest cost possible.
4129 2018-08-06 16:55:14 Gawd, I hope it ends on an oil rig.

4135 2018-08-06 16:54:42 My own thoughts about the #SaudiaArabia issue with Canada, is how important it is for us to get away from oil so that we never have to deal with a human rights violating regime.
4136 2018-08-06 16:54:39 Also, since crude oil is such a fungible commodity, & because Iran has such a high grade crude, purchasers & sellers will find a way to get it.

4141 2018-08-06 16:54:20 Actually, the lowering in gas prices under Obama last two years was directly due to embargo lift of Iranian oil, and the rise under trump had directly to do with the pullout out of the Iran deal and the oil no longer being available.

4149 2018-08-06 16:53:30 Borenstein links to a discussion of local environmental effects. 

I included Econ 101 information that surprised me: Europeans with high oil taxes pay producers less than the US does. Some energy economists consider fewer $ to producers good, as Borenstein mentioned
4150 2018-08-06 16:53:30 Just wanna know why @TaylorW_22 would think it’s a good idea to put extra virgin olive oil on the slip n slide last night...
4151 2018-08-06 16:53:29 It's about time ... carnival barker, snake oil salesman, purveyor of divisiveness, paranoia, distrust and fear... and Trump learns from him ... what a mess. Talk about fakes - Jones, Trump and Company.
4152 2018-08-06 16:53:28 I’m pretty sure I can change my oil myself ..... but I don’t have a drip pan and I don’t think i can handle oil possibly getting on my face or hair
4153 2018-08-06 16:53:27 Makes one wonder - do you think Saudi Arabia buys oil from any other producers or are they their own best customer?
4154 2018-08-06 16:53:24 The alternative to Carbon Tax will be to regulate the amount of oil being produced. Which will have the same result of raising prices for people but deprive govenments of the revenue required to invest in less carbon intensive alternatives.
We change, or nature will force us to.
4155 2018-08-06 16:53:24 Not far off at all. I'd be willing to bet on a p1 finish before the end of the season!!!

4166 2018-08-06 16:52:29 Sorry I forgot it’s always the rich’s fault, during the 70’s, when North Sea oil was at its highest output, income tax on the rich was over 90%.

4186 2018-08-06 16:50:40 Pakistan currently meets only 15 percent of its domestic petroleum needs with crude oil production of around 22 million tons; the other 85 percent is met through imports. If they find a multi-billion reservoir they no longer need import.
4187 2018-08-06 16:50:39 You might start by explaining where your electricity will come from after you lose the stuff we send you? I’m told it’s about 4 nuclear power stations & equal to what France sends. See also gas and oil. Whisky and food make up significant portion of U.K. exports. Replacement?
4188 2018-08-06 16:50:34 THIRD TIME I’ve seen that !

And the third time I’m going to ask, so maybe this time I’ll get an answer. 

96.5% of oil resources.  That is impressive.

So - how much did the humungeously impressive 96.5% of oil resources raise for the country in 2016-17 ?

Take yer time.

4196 2018-08-06 16:49:31 Im genuinely concerned bc u ate a box pf uncooked PASTA of course im gonna tell u how!! also!! add a pinch of oil and salt once the water is boiling before u add in the pasta. makes it taste better

4200 2018-08-06 16:49:10 Can't speak for Ezra but if Trudeau came out and said screw Saudi Arabia we are going ahead with energy east and won't buy a drop of Saudi oil, I would be quite happy. My guess is Ezra would be too.

4206 2018-08-06 16:48:36 So look for it!!! It's called Google Search. Type in Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 and realize it was the USA and Canada's #1 Cash Crop before the conglomerate families of evil deemed it Schedule 1 even though it's never killed and helps and cures 700 medical conditions.

4208 2018-08-06 16:48:26 Alex Jones is a 21st century snake oil salesman. He says outlandish stuff in order to drive clicks to his website so he can sell you marked up products that are misleading at best. Unfortunately, there are idiots out there that believe the click bait he spews 24/7.
4209 2018-08-06 16:48:26 Pot is legal here in Cali, I get mine delivered, it's cheaper then med's and I dont have a pill hang over. The pot i get is good, I smoke before I go to bed, it helps me relax me old bones. I want to try the oil too.

4213 2018-08-06 16:48:07 That’s why we moved to Texas. My home state was growing far too blue.
4214 2018-08-06 16:48:04 Those companies may decide to raise their prices at the same time based on the same event. An obvious event would be an increase of crude oil prices. Several companies may decide at the same time they do not want to be in business with Alex Jones based on the same event.
4215 2018-08-06 16:48:02 WTI oil at $69.39/barrel, +$0.91 as Saudi output shows a surprise decline.

is close to hitting huge oil reserves in the 100 billion barrels range near the Pakistan-Iran border. which make up 8.4 percent of oil reserves in the world.

4219 2018-08-06 16:47:46 Oil kam hai... 
4220 2018-08-06 16:47:41 We have never had a great feedback loop for most food or even health and beauty products we consume. Palm kernel oil, issues with “sustainable fishing”, the damage done by raising cattle...all things we don’t hear about in MSM.
4221 2018-08-06 16:47:35 *New business.  Oil will be covered under "Old".

No worries.  The East will be able to keep sending Canadian $$$ to Saudi Arabia instead of buying from Western CDN Provinces like you are implying.

Nothing like taking care of your own!
4222 2018-08-06 16:47:35 Well that oil we produce runs ur electricity and let u tweet now! Imagine what happened in 70s happens again! U will ride horses again dude!
4223 2018-08-06 16:47:32 @Colts the @IronPigs  have an off day today, and we can Lucas Oil Stadium out of the hotel window! Any chance for a tour today?!
4224 2018-08-06 16:47:31 This, at least the monitoring portion, is a job for local/oil police forces, not the army.
4225 2018-08-06 16:47:24 Seeing what Qatar, Saudi Arabia  and UAE are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil
4226 2018-08-06 16:47:20 We sell ag water to Saudi Arabia via alfalfa, in return we will buy more oil by lowering fuel efficiency standards

4228 2018-08-06 16:47:19 Obviously it's about the oil, wildlife and something little about USAID stuff
4229 2018-08-06 16:47:08 Somehow, my oil cap has come off. Do you think I can buy one in the entirety of Swansea? 

Of course I fucking can't.
4230 2018-08-06 16:47:01 watered down snake oil is way more effective than pure snake oil
4231 2018-08-06 16:46:40 @Thom_Hartmann This sounds like a lot of infiltration, but we're talking decades and decades. #Putin's MAIN ASSETS in the denuded post #USSR #Russia was oil and a #SuperPower's massive covert intelligence  infrastructure/network. He's remotely managing @GOP via the #FarRight.
4232 2018-08-06 16:46:39 "take wealth" you're so lame.  you watch too much liberal media. Do you think African tribesmen living in huts made from feces and sand were actually using uranium and oil? It made zero difference to their lives.
4233 2018-08-06 16:46:25 If you look at their coasts, they have about two and a half Californias. So, lots of potential tourism, farming, and oil further inland. Not your worst idea. Not by a long shot.
4234 2018-08-06 16:46:23 It needs to be cut open to determine what killed it before its buried. We need to know if its radiation, plastic, oil or what killed it.
4235 2018-08-06 16:46:21 Bravo.  Looks great.  My favourite dressing is olive oil n red wine vinegar with a pinch of salt n pepper.  Love salad.
4236 2018-08-06 16:46:15 A lot of canned food

Appliances . Esp electric stove and iron 
Clothes(jeans and tees)

4237 2018-08-06 16:46:14 I hate it, but yeah we gotta give up all those things and stop letting big oil strangle the life out of all clean energy research. Also, there are not too many people on this planet. There are too many wasteful, wealth hoarding, socio/psychopaths who need to fucking die off.
4238 2018-08-06 16:46:10 We already have a fine federal standard. It's the Second Amendment. Comply with it.
4239 2018-08-06 16:46:09 I had one art teacher challenge us kids an try. Another that wanted me to learn the style an history of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Back then I did airbrush work not oil painting so was a odd request.

4242 2018-08-06 16:46:00 @LaneOrganic’s Argan & Frankincense oil serum is amazing! Beautiful, organic facial moisturizer which is lovely day or night.  I am an extremely natural, ‘product’-free person, but this I can’t recommend enough :)

4245 2018-08-06 16:45:53 keith bishop is a shitty unimaginative PR entity in this field. I am intrigued how he will put a positive spin on this for Mike Ashley. Its going to be fun. Its not about shooting arrows at Rafa anymore or trying to say he cant compete with Oil Money #nufc

4250 2018-08-06 16:45:27 Anyway, I just made an appointment for an oil change and they didn't even ask for my name or anything, just said 3:45 with Alex on the 9th. I am gonna role up and ask for Alex and he is gonna be like who this???
4251 2018-08-06 16:45:27 Didn’t Saudis cut off all oil exports to Canada as part of the overall severing severing commercial ties with Canada? If not, they are hypocrites and Canada should immediately cut all ties and imports from Saudis and expel Saudi nationals from our soil.

4256 2018-08-06 16:45:01 I stained my new Phish shirt with CBD oil this morning.
4257 2018-08-06 16:44:53 Anyone got any advice on using CBD for their CH? I have some oil but not sure about dosage.@Clusterheads
4258 2018-08-06 16:44:51 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
4259 2018-08-06 16:44:50 I literally have to oil and moisturize my hair everyday. Skip a day and I definitely notice a difference.
4260 2018-08-06 16:44:46 Who called him a scholar? He’s definitely a philanthropist supporting scholars...which is way more than the oil barons do for Oklahoma schools. Also, being a scholar isn’t always formal, scholarship comes from learning and production.
4261 2018-08-06 16:44:44 That’s why we also push for better federal standards and enforcement.
And if criminals are being forced to go to states with lax laws, that indicates that stricter laws are working.  The strict laws aren’t the problem; the loose ones next door are.
4262 2018-08-06 16:44:41 Im felling good i done woke up all early and went and got a oil change  im feeling too good lmfaoo
4263 2018-08-06 16:44:40 do people just say the infowars supplement is snake oil because they hate infowars or is it really bad shit? because nootropics are very real... ?_?
4264 2018-08-06 16:44:39 'Tax' revenues vs. 'Royalty' revenues sound pretty similar to me. And I would argue that oil production in ND much more directly impacts residents than does oil production on the N Slope. Most Alaskans have never even been to the North Slope. 
 
Hammond's PFD idea was brilliant.
4265 2018-08-06 16:44:24 I say again its not Scotlands Oil at all. It belongs to all the proplr of UK at the moment. When Scotland gets its independence from London and joins the EU then it will be the EU Oil not yours.
4266 2018-08-06 16:44:09 All the evidence? Like:
-Give #JavelinMissiles 2 #Ukraine
-Bomb Russia() ally Assad 
-annihilate 100s of mercenaries N #Syria
-Increase @NATO $$
-Try2stop German/pipeline
-Export oil 2 Europe competing w/

4271 2018-08-06 16:43:48 Oh, that's not accurate. They see what he does, they hear what he says, then they turn around and distorts the truth about it all. Not long ago, people in Haiti rioted because gas & oil prices were raised. MSM said it was because Trump insulted the island.
4272 2018-08-06 16:43:23 First oil change of my cars life with me, we're making progress

4285 2018-08-06 16:41:53 And, to those who don't think all this Islamamania with the ISIS @liberal_party isn't tied to OPEC, here's your proof that it is. The protesters being arrested, the ambassador being kicked out, freezing trade w/Canada. Time to stop the flow of foreign oil and use our own.

4297 2018-08-06 16:41:03 Yes we do. Also growing our resource and curbing Canada's reliance on Saudi oil would be another good response.
4298 2018-08-06 16:40:58 If we had their level of oil we would also develop fast.
4299 2018-08-06 16:40:57 Contango is a term that descibes a point where a crude oil oversupply exists and makes storing oil for future sales more profitable than selling today.

4327 2018-08-06 16:38:38 Really u think so... I think it was more then mere oil price... But anyhow it's useless to talk past...our present and future will be critical...

Be honest did you know that?
4329 2018-08-06 16:38:35 Cannot compare your oil preserves to ours at all.. What you both have in total is considered to be a swimming pool,..  More oil more power and stability
4330 2018-08-06 16:38:33 Brent futures curve has been in a large #contango—a market structure in which front-month prices are lower than prices out in the future months—pointing to a crude oil oversupply

4336 2018-08-06 16:38:07 Who tryna teach me how to do a oil change
4337 2018-08-06 16:38:05 I used some almond oil, The lottabody, and eco gel. Still let’s you have your “crunch” but way more movement once that settles. I can flip my parts and not worry about frizz

4340 2018-08-06 16:37:48 I now see the see reason why the south south is not develop despite producing crude oil to feed the whole nation. The northerners thought dem how to exploit their own people and impoverished the region for their personal interest and political ambition,Shame on you akpkabio!!!
4341 2018-08-06 16:37:34 water and coconut oil are definitely the best things on earth, their combos really are something extraordinary.

4346 2018-08-06 16:37:07 Except it fries birds, bats and other winged beasts that accidentally fly over them. Oh, right, only oil sands have to pay for dead birds. Solar and wind get a free pass on the critter carnage they cause.

4352 2018-08-06 16:36:04 New Brunswick’s refinery, which is the largest in Canada, cannot buy oil from Alberta because the Trudeau Liberals killed the Energy East pipeline. Instead oil comes from foreign sources, like Saudi Arabia. Nice work Ottawa.

4357 2018-08-06 16:35:33 Russia now controls the field, because Trump (and Cruz) gave up on Mideast to placate Putin, drive up world oil prices & create loopholes for sanctions. But, @tedcruz doesn’t talk about that because the Christian Taliban in US would lose their shit.

4363 2018-08-06 16:35:07 Still a seed oil
4364 2018-08-06 16:35:06 I fully intend to wash and hot oil treat my hair today. If I have to sit on the shower floor to do so, so be it, cramps.

4382 2018-08-06 16:33:26 It’s about a super rich oil barren who is hell bent on destroying the world, Seagal is a chef and infiltrates the Kremlin pretending to be an ambassador then kicks arse!! You can’t write this stuff it writes itself. Lol
4383 2018-08-06 16:33:25 We also must break from oil mongering and realize free energy is available let's focus on that.
4384 2018-08-06 16:33:12 Another present for Putin and the Russian Economy. Breaking our international agreements regarding Iran & restoring sanctions will drive up the cost of oil including Russian oil exports. Just what their failing economy needs right now. Russia has no sanctions against Iran.

4401 2018-08-06 16:31:46 We aren't set up in any way to successfully tell them where to shove their oil. We couldn't even stop using fossil fuels in the next 10 or 20 years and unless we start producing our own (which we know wont happen), we will basically just stop functioning.

4406 2018-08-06 16:31:17 And fewer banks will, going forward. The US financial market is the dominant one, and all bank big enough to clear oil trades won't consider incurring US sanctions, irrespective of what the #EU will say. #OOTT

4409 2018-08-06 16:31:09 I thought applying some oil would repell the bugs, but apparently they stick on me when they land and I kill them

4410 2018-08-06 16:31:04 Like when they had that oil spill problem in New Orleans, the gusher they couldn't cap, it was just a distraction until they got all those financial laws passed, and the reason you know, is because the same exact day they passed the legislation, all of a sudden they capped it.
4411 2018-08-06 16:31:02 This is a low IQ Trump thing to deflect from reality that doesn’t make much sense. There is a written agreement in effect that the world signed—not like the North Korea fake agreement. I’m sure it’s about oil and to cause an incident so Trump, Israel, and Saudi can attack Iran.

4419 2018-08-06 16:30:24 That's exactly what's is my point, western fascist empire want to control all country oil and gas by privatization and so called OPEC. It's similar to what British scums did in Indian while they ruled India.
4420 2018-08-06 16:30:14 Greenpeace doesn't protest Saudi tankers on the way in.... just North American oil

4434 2018-08-06 16:28:55 You’re right, that makes total sense.

4458 2018-08-06 16:27:23 The antivaxx will use bleach (MMS) in an enema to detox their children from vaccines and imaginary worms and call it a cure for autism  Their snake oil does not have any humanity in it. They will sell anything for a dollar. Antivaxx and snake oil a symbiotic relationship.
4459 2018-08-06 16:27:14 I agree and think there are much better reasons to support green energy but it’s a nice side-effect if it disempowers the despotic regimes whose only economic contribution to the world is to pump oil. Their response shows the false sense of entitlement that petro-dollars provide.

4464 2018-08-06 16:26:54 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
4465 2018-08-06 16:26:50 Except we know you're wrong because oil and gas facilities do this every single day all over the planet.
4466 2018-08-06 16:26:47 You can make an order for Russian oil in good time before winter. Few tankerloads 
4467 2018-08-06 16:26:43 you mean instead of doing the exact opposite like backing out of the Paris climate accord, rolling back mileage goals for autos, blocking development of renewable energy, and decreasing emission restrictions for industry? he’s the coal and oil president, take a deep breath.
4468 2018-08-06 16:26:37 That type of lawoy punishes law abiding folks; the criminals still get guns.

4473 2018-08-06 16:26:05 My positive feelings feel like water & the negative feel like oil. For the last couple of weeks, I've been doing my best to somehow mix the two with hopes that the good vibes will shine through. But lately, it feels as though oil is showing it's true nature & keeps surfacing. 
4474 2018-08-06 16:26:02 Ya the only have 3 exports, oil, that we can buy from anyone else,sand and terrorists. I think we can do with out them thanks
4475 2018-08-06 16:25:33 You ever have an amazing meal at a restaurant but then when you go to heat up the leftovers it’s like...

DAMN this is a bowl of OIL
4476 2018-08-06 16:25:23 Foolish legislators in blue states especially follow the Bloomberg dogma without regard for opposing views. It's very stupid to have struct laws in NJ when a quick trip over the Deleware to PA can circumvent all of them.
4477 2018-08-06 16:25:22 Saudi Arabia’s #1 export is oil and terrorism (more of the latter). They also make their women dress up as ninjas 
4478 2018-08-06 16:25:22 Good question, the paper that reported that didn't say. I assume that it's uncooked olive oil
4479 2018-08-06 16:25:01 2)Biz firms hv little interest in d small economy of Iran,as it's only a small population.

IT IS d oil/gas that EU leaders need,presumed cheap for now,to keep their seats by promising its citizens low fuel costs,keep them happy enough to vote for them again.
4480 2018-08-06 16:24:52 Don't agree Aidan they will want billions if they sell, somebody will buy and leverage the club, there will be nothing for anything. The same will happen with FSG and the Arab when the oil is gone.
4481 2018-08-06 16:24:47 Global warming is real! And I fear that it’s too late to stop all the effects of it even if the whole world would stick together and reacted immediately. I’m a specialist for groundwater protection and I see future wars coming about water resources, not about oil... #HopeImWrong
4482 2018-08-06 16:24:34 The 1973 Arab Oil Embargo crippled the US economy. The US never fully recovered. And the 1978-1979 Energy Crisis had gas lines three blocks long. When there was gas. And it was your turn to buy it (Even/Odd Days, Red/Green Flag Days)
4483 2018-08-06 16:24:30 It is amazing how good $100 oil can make a socialist petrostate look... temporarily

One would be wrong.

We finally soaked it in coconut oil and left it to work off on its own, which it eventually did.
4494 2018-08-06 16:24:02 You need oil regardless
4495 2018-08-06 16:24:02 Dude, looks like you went cheap on the oil change yesterday...

4500 2018-08-06 16:23:31 Saudi Arabia is the 2nd largest supplier of crude oil in Canada (tied with Algeria), after the United States. In 2016, U.S. imports were at 54% and Saudi Arabia's were at 11%. The eastern Canadian provinces receive the majority of crude oil imports.
4501 2018-08-06 16:23:26 Dang does it make it dry or something? I only use the Moroccan Argan oil one
4502 2018-08-06 16:23:25 I also think they have an insane fantasy of taking Iran's oil.. Like he  had about Iraq.
4503 2018-08-06 16:23:18 Will they stop selling oil to Quebec and Canada? We have no Energy Est pipeline. Argument was that we can use clean energy. So where is this clean energy alternative and how much of it is being consumed?

4506 2018-08-06 16:22:49 @SecondLady we don't really think trump or yr husband will be in office very long. trump hates animals because they're in his way to gas/oil/bad environmental practices. can't u guys wake him up a little. animals are GOOD.  He's a nutcase. and you know it.
4507 2018-08-06 16:22:46 I'm glad to hear it. So you are probably not happy with Trump rolling back a lot of environmental protections either, plus drilling for oil in National Parks and such.

The amount of crude oil Nigeria exports daily is unknown

NNPC still don't open its financial books for scrutiny

Buhari, the petroleum minister, is redefining corruption!
4509 2018-08-06 16:22:38 Gun control advocates don't realize or at least won't admit that their own laws undermine their cause.  They create a differential in gun laws in the states and then deny the implications of the movement of guns to states with onerous laws.
4510 2018-08-06 16:22:32 Give me hemp oil and coconut oil any day.
4511 2018-08-06 16:22:32 Wow watching Billions season 2 and im shocked about outside pressure on the Nigerian Oil market.
4512 2018-08-06 16:22:18 lol I'm sure they already own some oil infrastructure

4516 2018-08-06 16:21:58 The King of Debt is doing everything he can to lower the price of oil by begging OPEC for more production...  and destroying export markets with trade wars. If you are in the LTO industry, with friends like that, who needs enemies?

4521 2018-08-06 16:21:23 It will have no effect on Saudi Arabia. Oil is a world commodity and it will just be sold to someone else.
4522 2018-08-06 16:21:22 We should buy more of their oil. That fixed things. Keep ours in the ground to change the weather. They seem nice.
4523 2018-08-06 16:21:19 The only trade talk that was on 1260 about this was that Brouwer would be be a downgrade for Kassian. Which I fully agree with
That being said ... this is the Oil management so who 
knows ...

4525 2018-08-06 16:21:11 Our so called allies will not be getting a kick back from Iran from the money the US gave to Iran so I am sure they will be unhappy and they are foolish to depend on Russia for their oil as Russia can turn off the spigot any time they want.
4526 2018-08-06 16:21:10 Heyooo. I get great results with a cast iron pan with vegetable oil on a maxed out stove burner, but currently trying perfect it on my Kamado grill. Gonna try to get it up to around 800 degrees next time. Reverse sear is so much better than anything I've ever had from a home cook
4527 2018-08-06 16:20:56 When you mention olive oil in your article, do you mean oil that has been taken to the smoke point?
4528 2018-08-06 16:20:50 New Jersey's strict gun laws have created a magnet for crime guns to enter the state. It's called the Iron Pipeline and been written about often.
4529 2018-08-06 16:20:48 Amazing as always! Why would we want a self sufficent country that can employ people and meet our own energy demands? Much easier to virtue signal about saving the planet while getting breast fed from the oil sands

4531 2018-08-06 16:20:41 The trade wars are a cover up for the known oil shortage of low sulphur oil.
The hard part is understanding that small refineries cannot Buy High and Sell Low. If they pay higher $ for feedstock yet can't pass cost on to customer they go broke. Making Low Sulphur oil.... 1/2

4555 2018-08-06 16:18:14 Rising transportation costs are the biggest driver here, broken into two major causes, one cyclical and one more structural -  price of oil and shortage of drivers.

4580 2018-08-06 16:15:03 Mostly agree....except for the millions of bbls of we oil we buy from Saudi annually.

If you are firm enough to tweet and chastise the Kingdom - stop buying their product.

4592 2018-08-06 16:14:36 80% of north sea oil is scottish 
20% is English apart from the 6K nile Blair stole the night scots parly opened by moving the sea border to fucking st Andrews
Did you know that was done David?
4593 2018-08-06 16:14:33 its easy when you have royal oil money
4594 2018-08-06 16:14:29 His main issue is climate change and yet he supported fracking queen and pro oil pipeline Clinton over Bernie.
4595 2018-08-06 16:14:25 You have promised lower beer prices and lower gas prices.
I suggest that both the brewers and oil co’s recognize that lowering prices increases consumption. Economics 101. Put another way,  are you encouraging an increase in drinking and driving?

4597 2018-08-06 16:14:19 About to go get an oil change 
4598 2018-08-06 16:14:13 No @CBCNews We did not import $2,3B in "mineral products" from Saudia Arabia. We imported oil. Because the enviro crowd has blocked the energy east pipeline. 
You're covering for the liberals. Again.
4599 2018-08-06 16:14:08 As I've said, one popular pistol used by Mexican gangs is made in Belgium. I can try to find a source on that, if you insist, but that's what the report I heard several years ago said.
4600 2018-08-06 16:13:47 If what you say is true, wouldn't it be better to export the oil than stagnate the industry?
4601 2018-08-06 16:13:46 I can not find my peppermint oil for nothing. I be hiding stuff from my own self. lol
4602 2018-08-06 16:13:43 Hey Colin @TheHerd NO one cares about the 2019 NBA playoffs, let's talk football. I like your "Oil Change" infomercial better than your NBA talk.
4603 2018-08-06 16:13:39 .Dude!  Do we have to teach you everything? First, the Americans have to find oil in Saudi Arabia.  Then the West has to prop up your tinpot shaky regime.  We invent Twitter so you can troll us.  Does Putin have to teach you to meddle effectively too? #Canada #SaudiArabia

4607 2018-08-06 16:13:26 Hungrily parsing through Barthes’ “A Lover’s Discourse” and dousing myself in jasmine oil is a mood
4608 2018-08-06 16:13:21 SA will need to sell oil to transform their economy to less oil dependent over next 5-10 yrs. They are losing US export market & competing w/ Iranians & Russians who are happily supplying the east. What will they do? Worse still, they will be taking haircuts on treasury holdings.
4609 2018-08-06 16:13:20 Damn!!!!!Oil will be expensive again.
4610 2018-08-06 16:13:18 Cool I’ll have a box for sale soon. It’s a monthly scented beard oil and a hatchet.
4611 2018-08-06 16:13:12 Please please try CBD oil, it is helping me and So many others with anxiety and depression!!  It's what we are missing! Message me if you want.
4612 2018-08-06 16:13:08 It's not just "frequent nonsense," there's every indication Jones and Infowars prey on the ignorant and fearful in order to sell them snake oil cures. The state needs to be critiqued, but it must done responsibly, otherwise it's just fearmongering.
4613 2018-08-06 16:13:00 Corn oil contains a natural mixture of free phytosterol, phytosterol esters, and phytostanol esters. Research has shown that phytosterols play an important role in reducing blood cholesterol by controlling its absorption from the intestines.

4614 2018-08-06 16:12:53 Great time to move away from oil anyways.

4617 2018-08-06 16:12:47 Note that phrase, traced guns. The ATF admitted that they only counted guns that could be traced. Lots of guns couldn't be traced and weren't included in the sample.
4618 2018-08-06 16:12:47 Come on what have they done decent ...in 11 years...
No using vote winning gimmicks but what have they done to benefit all Scots ...never did a thing during oil slump did they ...
4619 2018-08-06 16:12:39 @britneyspears you have a short Greek ancestry alongside with your Maltese roots, pour some olive oil to your salad Britney and say goodbye to these Jewish idiots who made you suffer...
4620 2018-08-06 16:12:33 Half of Newfoundland works in the patch and they're extremely hard working folks. Also, that oil goes a long way to pay for a lot of important things in all of Canada for all Canadians.
That said, Scheer is a moron in general, ignore him.

4624 2018-08-06 16:12:25 Where's any backing of this? She has been extremely outspoken in favor of Alberta oil. Also, your claim that I am "another brainwashed ATA member is so far off base, don't even reply to this. I'm not looking for a personal fight. I just want our politicians to be better for us.
4625 2018-08-06 16:12:18 I haven't since I was a kid. It's yucky. The oil spreads by contact.

4630 2018-08-06 16:12:01 Early indications are that the cbd oil is helping Moo return to her usual space cadet self. Complicated rescue cat behaviour + adverse effect of extreme weather = a very worrying few weeks. Hopefuly we have turned the corner.
4631 2018-08-06 16:11:57 I'm in the same boat as all of you - mod. scoliosis, arthritis everywhere, s.i. joint dysfunction, pubic symphysis separation, bad knees, etc., etc. ad nauseum.
I'm using CBD oil and still some pain meds while I wait for our legislature to calm down and write parameters for THC.
4632 2018-08-06 16:11:56 If massive gun control were imposed, that would create a demand for smuggling. It's economic forces at work, and those forces are why gun control will fail whenever there's a demand.
4633 2018-08-06 16:11:56 I eyeing a likkle small piece ah land myself.  Plenty obstacles to get through before the oil & $$ start to flow.  But it don’t hurt to start prep eh?
4634 2018-08-06 16:11:49 I stained my new Phish shirt with CBD oil this morning.
4635 2018-08-06 16:11:47 Dreaming dream
4636 2018-08-06 16:11:43 Saudi Arabia is a joke. Without oil, they are Yemen.
4637 2018-08-06 16:11:43 I need to find a suitable vitamin C oil but there's so much to take into account when getting one. 
4638 2018-08-06 16:11:29 I'll second Kyle on trimming the mustache off the lip. Eating beard is gross.

Things that have made me like my beard more:
1. Using conditioner + beard oil
2. A wooden comb (@mhartington taught me this one)
3. Having a professional barber take the bushiness out of the sides
4639 2018-08-06 16:11:25 あと何枚集めるつもりなんですか
4640 2018-08-06 16:11:24 so apparently my skin doesn’t like the new black castor oil I’ve been putting in my hair because it’s decided to breakout.
4641 2018-08-06 16:11:23 I don’t think my coffee needs soybean oil.
4642 2018-08-06 16:11:22 RT younglivingeo MarketKatie We'd hate to see you go Katie! Unfortunately, we had to put a limit on this oil and made them into 5 ml bottles since our inventory ran out way to quickly for it. This was the best way to keep the product in stock longer!
4643 2018-08-06 16:11:13 In Australia, the high eucalyptus oil content in our trees is a serious contributor to devastating bush fires. 
4644 2018-08-06 16:11:11 And if USA buys oil it is to sell you weapons to kill innocents in your country
4645 2018-08-06 16:11:00 & I been using this wild growth oil too
4646 2018-08-06 16:10:58 sounds amazing and I love olive oil, but a cup? 8 fl ounces of olive oil?! for real?
4647 2018-08-06 16:10:53 Honey that happens here in Texas too.   My ex-hubby who is a Native Texan, is one of many who do it recreationally.  He’s making good use of all that oil field income he earns.  The man started back in high school. Lots of daddy and granddaddy’s oil & gas and construction money.
4648 2018-08-06 16:10:51 Contango means nothing imo, that can change in an instant. Oil had periods where it was in contango at 40/50/60 and it still went higher.
The market is flat out wrong,  just like it was at $35.
4649 2018-08-06 16:10:48 We'd hate to see you go Katie! Unfortunately, we had to put a limit on this oil and made them into 5 ml bottles since our inventory ran out way to quickly for it. This was the best way to keep the product in stock longer!

4653 2018-08-06 16:10:43 Oil will be with us for my life time but I still expect that within 10 years most new cars will be electric - mainly as there is a push for this and most car companies are investing in that line 3/
4654 2018-08-06 16:10:40 Google, like most banks and all oil companies,  are trans-national enterprises they're no friend to the American people
4655 2018-08-06 16:10:36 That is true. Drop gun control, and work on what we should be doing.
4656 2018-08-06 16:10:35 Probably not due to being too old and worn out. If there is one near Tulsa, OK I might.
4657 2018-08-06 16:10:30 How long have we been trading with KSA? Why is it so important for #TrudeauGroper and his government to criticize them now? Another scheme to weaken Canada after putting the kibosh on the pipelines and ruining our oil industry.

4660 2018-08-06 16:10:12 BAM, you are a hypocrite. And how much government subsidy money l is going to pay for these solar panels? Your everyday life requires oil @MikeHudema , so why don’t you look in the mirror you hypocrite.
4661 2018-08-06 16:10:06 Oh wow pictures from the time before USA became self sufficient in oil (like Canada now) well too bad, we don’t need your oil since 20 years
4662 2018-08-06 16:10:06 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
4663 2018-08-06 16:10:02 Too simplistic still, since I have guns that are readily accessible to me, and yet I've done no wrong with them.

My point is that until you take other factors into account, your statement isn't valid.
4664 2018-08-06 16:09:59 Savannah: I purposely left my church pamphlet, tanning oil, and pre- workout in my front seat for him to find. 
4665 2018-08-06 16:09:52 egg stuck to the pan cus no oil

4667 2018-08-06 16:09:46 おやあり
4668 2018-08-06 16:09:35 Maybe you should be angry at the oil companies that are making far more money than what is going to Alberta or transfer payments.  Alberta has badly mismanaged their oil revenue for decades, in part because they contract for so little in royalties.
4669 2018-08-06 16:09:34 Always been snake oil sales pitches. And gullible people.
4670 2018-08-06 16:09:33 Do you use fish oil pills?
4671 2018-08-06 16:09:26 おやすみー
4672 2018-08-06 16:09:24 The petro dollar as we have come to understand it with US buying SA oil and SA recycling surpluses back into treasury’s for US security is over, for the simple reason that SA is generating significantly smaller CA surpluses via oil sales. And US export strategy will worsen this.
4673 2018-08-06 16:09:23 There is loads of oil but the big finds get smaller, current supplies run out, what is found is at a higher cost, at some stage we hit the point where alternatives esp when you include geopolitical risk outweigh, we aren't there yet but it could happen suddenly 2/
4674 2018-08-06 16:09:20 Instead of you reading it 9 times ask an adult next time!

It's irrelevant others have under/over estimates NS oil. The point ur too stupid to understand is McCrone stated Scotland would have "chronic surplus" & strongest currency in Europe based on massively low estimations!
4675 2018-08-06 16:09:20 3. Pollution from coal, oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  When are they going to pay trillions of dollars in fines?  Pollution from coal in China kills in China and then travels to West Coast of USA.
4676 2018-08-06 16:09:19 Lockheed would be in a little trouble without #oil, don't you think?  You are a pandering hypocrite...
4677 2018-08-06 16:09:15 That monster run is what first got me excited about trading

I picked up some $MMEX recently in the .003 range. A friend in the Texas oil industry has seen their plans and knows the companies they are working with. Hopefully we get a repeat whenever they get financing going

4679 2018-08-06 16:09:02 $300/barrel for oil is very good for Russian economy.
4680 2018-08-06 16:08:51 You also haven't proved that gun ownership is any part of the problem.
4681 2018-08-06 16:08:50 Killing time during an oil change, I walked into a sneaker store & didn’t buy anything. I feel like this is growth.

4687 2018-08-06 16:08:32 @Davidkat1818 saw ur post on Facebook. It made me laugh. Barnet Formula is there, because we subsidise Englandshire. In Scotland we pay more in than we get back. That's why we want rid of u. We want our oil, money etc to stay in Scotland. Get your facts right
4688 2018-08-06 16:08:31 I wondered that myself. But since EVERY SINGLE MOVE #PMJT has made on energy policy has been against Alberta oil, so I'd be shocked if he supported Energy East. And yes, I believe buying #TMX with our tax$ was to stall it. But we shall see.
4689 2018-08-06 16:08:28 It keeps your beard moisturized and shiny, as well as the skin beneath the beard. If you’re not using an oil or a balm, you’re doing your beard a disservice. I personally like BeardBrand utility balms (old money and four vices scents are the best)
4690 2018-08-06 16:08:26 Yes women can drive now but he literally made up the part of having the lowest rate of poverty and human rights abuse, I have been to Saudi and their are a lot of people living in poverty unlike other oil/gas rich Gulf states like UAE Qatar and Kuwait
4691 2018-08-06 16:08:26 Name one oil field the USA has taken control of. Just one. Ill wait.
4692 2018-08-06 16:08:25 Outside of Inuit and the fish oil thing, and maybe lactose tolerance in Europeans is there any evidence or other examples for that idea?
4693 2018-08-06 16:08:22 I am concerned that you're right about your last sentence, but the truth about America is that we're a First World and a Third World country. Conditions in our big cities and in many rural areas are much more the latter than the former.

4698 2018-08-06 16:07:59 Canada already has the world's best environmental standards and practices in the world, when it comes to oil.

4721 2018-08-06 16:06:24 Indeed and they probably should rely on independent third-party estimates rather than use their own oil price forecasts.
4722 2018-08-06 16:06:24 My local garage is fantastic. Honest about have to over should. Have been dealing with them for over 15 years. 

There are just something’s I’ll spend money on tho stimulate the local economy. Oil changes are one.

4726 2018-08-06 16:06:13 Been drinking too much coffee, need to do oil pulling today.
4727 2018-08-06 16:06:12 we are just trying to break a legally elected government, because oil.  long grudge and greed held by us oil companies from their unfair 50 leases were not renewed and they have wanted revenge and now we have the mass mob and a globally controlled government
4728 2018-08-06 16:05:54 Again, I've shown you that no new gun law there resulted in a decline in homicides. Until you can deal with that fact, your case for gun control is dead.
4729 2018-08-06 16:05:45 Saudi Arabia has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world and Canada has the 3rd largest. If these two countries go to war we better get used to riding bikes.
4730 2018-08-06 16:05:29 #XOM
#NYMEX Crude oil at 69.70 correlation with #xom pushing price to 81.50
4731 2018-08-06 16:05:28 Our transfer station takes our old oil.
4732 2018-08-06 16:05:22 Maybe now we can use our own oil. :)
4733 2018-08-06 16:05:21 The Trump administration is now working to cut off all Iranian oil exports from the U.S. and allied nations by Nov. 4. The price of crude has risen on fears the world’s oil supply will tighten without Iran’s exports
4734 2018-08-06 16:05:11 Debating whether or not I should try to change my own oil 
4735 2018-08-06 16:05:08 I do agree that in a healthy society this is so & that all voices should be heard. But. In this society, voices of hate & irrationality, bots & cult, hate mongers r being used to stir up dissent for power & money. Guns & oil cartels for instance. We have to b aware of this.
4736 2018-08-06 16:05:07 The homicide rate of California is consistently almost the same as that of Texas--the two states fluctuate, and one will take the lead, then drop back behind the other, but they stay nearly identical. And yet their gun laws are significantly different.
4737 2018-08-06 16:05:06 Yet Again someone who can't read
I never once said I just smoked. In my initial tweet I said I use CBDs. In the form of oil, edibles, and concentrates. You picked what you wanted to hear.
You obviously never had cancer
4738 2018-08-06 16:04:59 When Canada is relying on Saudi oil it would have been wise to chose a more diplomatic approach. Unless of course we have a backup plan for oil. I’m sure we have pipelines in the works. Don’t we?
4739 2018-08-06 16:04:58 Black *seed oil
4740 2018-08-06 16:04:51 It was never your Oil. It belonged to the countries that had the treaty's for that area. I suppose next you will want Calais back as it used to belong to Gt Britain. Oil will one day not be used at all. If you want money then Tourism and manufacturing is the way forward.
4741 2018-08-06 16:04:46 Canada has shown to be more humane than you. You should command human rights because Islam says so. You are a disgrace to the Holy Sites that is on your terror land. You sold your soul so you can sell oil, all while killing innocent people. Hypocrits

4743 2018-08-06 16:04:43 I almost made it to the movies, but then rain happened. Got stuck in the rain at city oil! I've suffered.
4744 2018-08-06 16:04:43 “My advice to you, Mr. President, is to avoid touching the SPR – to cool down and give up sanctioning Iranian oil,” Iranian oil official Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told the White House
4745 2018-08-06 16:04:27 We are self sufficient in oil in Canada.
But we could buy from Venezuela or Iran of course
4746 2018-08-06 16:04:18 Nuln oil or a black wash over the grey will also work wonders
4747 2018-08-06 16:04:11 Holy hell, no wonder a barrel of oil is up in price, just look at his hair.
4748 2018-08-06 16:04:08 So roommate read that you can dip cotton balls in peppermint oil and leave it in places so mice don’t go there. However, I’m reading that it can be harmful to cats if they inhale or ingest it. Not sure if that’s true? Or if he’ll be okay if it’s in places he can’t reach?
4749 2018-08-06 16:04:03 Just wondering how efficient of solvent (using hexane) extraction in palm oil extraction process, compared to other means i.e. supercritical fuild extraction.
4750 2018-08-06 16:04:00 Selling of reserve oil would stabilize or lower the price of fuel in time for midterms when Republicans are nervous rising gas prices may swing some elections for the Democrats. The SPR currently holds about 660 million barrels of crude oil.
4751 2018-08-06 16:03:39 I like cooking with olive oil more than butter now
4752 2018-08-06 16:03:38 Just an old oil canal in Tangipahoa Parish. Most of my prettier pics are in Tangi
4753 2018-08-06 16:03:38 @BioLayne Mr. Norton, I read your article and wanted to ask for your opinion.

I currently add grass-fed butter to my coffee in the morning along with MCT oil. Would that exceed the 10% that is targeted for SFA? Or am I in the safe zone.
4754 2018-08-06 16:03:36 It's not hard to change the oil, but disposing of the old oil is a PITA.
4755 2018-08-06 16:03:33 President Donald Trump is weighing the risk of selling off 5 million to 30 million barrels of crude oil from the United States’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

4757 2018-08-06 16:03:26 This doesn't surprise me. What DOES surprise me, is how much oil Canada will import from Saudi Arabia - via tanker and then by pipeline - rather than from Alberta. I still can't figure that one out.
4758 2018-08-06 16:03:26 Almost all are dry. Not much oil left for this terrorist state..
4759 2018-08-06 16:03:22 Hopefully we start using our own oil and build some pipelines now. The are stopping trade so who's gonna fill the eastern refiners now?

4761 2018-08-06 16:03:19 I wish my mom would’ve sent her man to come get her oil change. Now I’m paying for some extra junk i don’t understand and I’m going on a fucking date. I’m sick.
4762 2018-08-06 16:03:16 Westminster is more undemocratic than EU.
We voted in our EU reps didn't we.
How would EU be worse than Westminster ignoring that half of scots want indy and taking our oil and gas by force?
How would EU be worse than that?
4763 2018-08-06 16:03:12 Well after the oil price collapse the SNP finance model was bull shit within weeks of the Ref. Most Scots know they missed a bullet and the pro Union margin in Scotland now would be greater

4771 2018-08-06 16:02:04 It is one of the best things going for them. It is about time we stopped selling Saudi’s weapons and stopped buying their oil.
4772 2018-08-06 16:02:04 I think  you have me mistaken with someone else!  I am on the side of the union and I was advising that within the McCrone report it says that Scotland wouldn't stay wealthy even with the oil money thus contradicting what the person I was replying to said!
4773 2018-08-06 16:01:49 Most of my relatives live in Quebec and would gladly take AB oil. They also supported EE.
But then they are mostly welders, machinery operators and the like, not intellectuals living on Plateau Mont Royal thinking the universe revolves around them.
4774 2018-08-06 16:01:45 Shale oil. Will be damaging for our water and environment. A bitter pill that is sadly necessary
4775 2018-08-06 16:01:45 @realDonaldTrump oil prices are ramping hard on Iran sanctions.  How about tapping that SPR? #OOTT
4776 2018-08-06 16:01:43 It's nice in the summer lots of olive oil and balsamic vinegar
4777 2018-08-06 16:01:41 This would not have happened under previous US Administration. Trump could care less what KSA does to its citizens. The only weapon we have is to “Stop buying Saudi oil.” The only option that works. Canada has plenty of its own until we all go solar or wind in the distant future.
4778 2018-08-06 16:01:24 uggh this just happened to me too. sure i like the new waffle and sushi bars, but where the hell is the olive oil?
4779 2018-08-06 16:01:09 My Acura dealer takes care of me.  Don’t have to pay for any of the regular work on the car or oil changes etc... the car wash is only OK but free.
4780 2018-08-06 16:01:04 Including your dirty oil. I only fill up my car with gas made from cruelty-free Western Canada Select, refined right here. You seem to have forgotten that there are so many other oil producers out there to choose from: Mexico, Venezuela, Norway, Russia, Iraq and your fav, IRAN
4781 2018-08-06 16:01:04 Oh, I get it.
Yeah, no the fact that animal remains decay and turn into oil is not an ethical issue. We don't have a hand in that process, and we didn't kill the animals to begin with.
4782 2018-08-06 16:01:01 It’s also incredible how this video makes a delicate flower like myself want to kick some butt.
4783 2018-08-06 16:00:57 I can show ya'll how to do an oil change! Doing it yourself is way cheaper than going to dealer/service.
4784 2018-08-06 16:00:54 @Bravotv Please make a response to @iammrssamuels end credits to her husband rubbing lavender oil on her tummy. As she has stated it’s not safe and we want to get the word out before anyone tries this! Please do your research before you write things!

4788 2018-08-06 16:00:30 We don't need their oil if we diversify our energy production here in Canada, we should start now and tell the Saudis to piss off, and I hope that PM @JustinTrudeau is listening #cdnpoli
4789 2018-08-06 16:00:26 That girl said he got saved from a baby oil ass whooping! And he ain’t say a word because he knew she wasn’t playing 
4790 2018-08-06 16:00:25 When trimming pubes should you put baby oil or baby powder after to prevent itching
4791 2018-08-06 16:00:21 Also a matter of self-interest to European states wishing to keep the oil price low.
4792 2018-08-06 16:00:17 This could've been the 2016-2017 motto in the oil and gas space. I might make it into a motivational poster and stick it in my office
4793 2018-08-06 16:00:17 in order for you to cure your cancer or put it in remission you need a lot of THC that doesn't come in joint form. Also CBD isn't going to help here. By using #JBOMethod you increase your chances by ~20% compared to just the oil. But if you think you know it all, can't help you
4794 2018-08-06 16:00:09 Soon oil will run dry. Imbecility is not a ressource. And since you delagate everything including your defense. You will be erased from history, it is just the logical next step.
4795 2018-08-06 16:00:09 Exfoliation and coconut oil.
4796 2018-08-06 16:00:01 Not if #TheResistance can help it. We need to do massive investment in #Wind, #Solar, #HighSpeedRail, mass transit, and infrastructure, and get off of oil, but it can be done. And we can coin our own wealth. #MMT
4797 2018-08-06 16:00:01 #DidYouKnow warm water opens up your pores? So wash your face with warm water to cleanse it of all the oil and dirt.
4798 2018-08-06 16:00:01 Besides,,scots need the EU to protect our oil and gas from our 300 year union partner,who went to Illegal war for oil in Iraq,,and will find it hard to watch scots walk away with thiers.
EU is more indy for scots than UK is thats for sure
4799 2018-08-06 16:00:00 And the fact that we give subsidies to the producers of sugar and soybean oil and not fruits and vegetables.
4800 2018-08-06 15:59:54 Then why does Trudeau import close to 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia and shut down pipelines coming from Alberta?
4801 2018-08-06 15:59:53 Everytime I get my oil changed they always find some other service I need to do. 
4802 2018-08-06 15:59:52 Canada has plenty of oil. And a population that is quite vocal. Canada wont give in without some concession from the Saudis.
4803 2018-08-06 15:59:47 The population density in Canada is 4 (p\km)!!!
What free place are you talking about? Free places will cause high consumption of gas to move around and visit relatives and obviously the oil from Saudi 

Man you should consider your tweet before you do!
4804 2018-08-06 15:59:44 Coconut oil is key ladies
4805 2018-08-06 15:59:33 Got myself some CBD oil on the weekend. The stuff is unreal. If you suffer with bad anxiety I recommend this !!
4806 2018-08-06 15:59:31 Followed all not already following
4807 2018-08-06 15:59:27 Iran will see hyper inflation and their oil will go to the USA soon
4808 2018-08-06 15:59:22 I started taking this hemp cbd oil by Green Gorilla & it has blessed My life tremendously. It helps with the pain, inflammation, cramping, & all the anxiety that comes with chronic pain. I recommend it to everyone. 

Also, Black see oil. Rubbing on brings immediate relief.
4809 2018-08-06 15:59:14 The supply from Saudi Arabia is a small percentage of the oil that Canada imports. There are many markets that can reach the east coast by tanker. This is a molehill of a problem.

4811 2018-08-06 15:58:47 Wishing you and your husband a blessed day when your son arrives!  Will you start him first on Put/Call ratios or Oil & Catyle Futures?  :)
4812 2018-08-06 15:58:47 If the creature is still alive, use some vegetable oil on the glue. Let it soak in for a few minutes and you can free them.  Any kind of cooking oil will work.

In the UK we lose 92% of our oil revenues to westminster,despite this we are told we are too skint for indy,,and we have no democracy at westminster.
All good reasons to leave UK and stay in EU

4817 2018-08-06 15:58:13 I agree. There is way too much palm oil in products and I don’t tend to consume these so I would like to know . I do however have a question about going dairy free?
4818 2018-08-06 15:58:11 the only industry that this fuel efficiency change would benefit is the oil industry. It is determined to undermine the future which is clearly heading towards electric, and other hybrid vehicles. #Gaslighting
4819 2018-08-06 15:58:09 The guy who just got smacked down several times by the courts for contempt, and who then got outed as a snake oil grifter selling monorails to small towns?  HA HA no.

4833 2018-08-06 15:56:56 Maybe it's time we reconsider where we get our oil?

4835 2018-08-06 15:56:34 Even if Alex Jones is a disingenuous profiteering snake oil salesman, to ban him for “racism” while the left allows any and all forms of it within their ranks is absolutely satanic and they love it. These people really did sell their souls and they’re about to lose everything.

4837 2018-08-06 15:56:34 Kobach makes a living off scamming towns into adopting anti-Muslim policies and then gets paid to defend those policies from the inevitable federal lawsuits.  He's no different than the Westboro Baptists or an old-timey snake oil salesman.

We rather not buy any oil and sell you no goods with Saudi Arabia
Respect freedom of speech and human rights for  your people first
You are a archaic feudal system out of time and date in the world
4840 2018-08-06 15:56:27 I'm sure!  When I first saw the pictures I couldn't believe no one was hurt?

Can you imagine if it were one of the gas/oil trains that run through downtown seeming constantly?  It would be a Lac-Megantic situation.
4841 2018-08-06 15:56:14 Saudi Arabia has nothing to offer Canada . We only buy their oil , because our politicians have been bought off by princes to do so .

WHAT a guy! Amirite? 
4846 2018-08-06 15:55:56 He really should be a snake oil salesman.
4847 2018-08-06 15:55:38 Some in the comments are saying the diluted the strong oil with water and that helped. You can try that and see how it works.
4848 2018-08-06 15:55:28 Trump made sure oil prices went up benefiting Putin's one cash crop. Now the Ruskies will help Trumps pals get reelected. It's a symbiotic relationship.

4853 2018-08-06 15:54:55 It's kind of irrelevant - oil discoveries are in long term decline - beyond shale everything we find is small by historical standards - most shale won't be used as not commercially viable - world will move on from oil either way not if but when

4857 2018-08-06 15:54:25 One time I bought a new car because my old car needed an oil change so if you think you are irreplaceable from my life think again.

You welcome
4860 2018-08-06 15:54:12 Trudeau would resign from pride parade before he gets his oil from Alberta. We all know how he feels about being a pride parade leader!
4861 2018-08-06 15:54:07 Been working on my essential oil class. Hope to have it finished off this week or beginning of next week.Been doing the free training through Jade Bloom University. I have learned a lot of interesting things.

4863 2018-08-06 15:54:01 Canada should build a pipe from Alberta to the east....maybe call it “energy east” where we could reduce dependency on this foreign oil and support Canada... what idiot wouldn’t support this novel idea!??!
4864 2018-08-06 15:53:53 Couldnt make these people up. Talkfracking says nobody mention fracking. It's what you're call yourself. That's what you talk about fracking. You accuse convention Oil sites of fracking. Been doing it for years. Spreading fear and Fake news. Now it's earth quakes . Garbage!
4865 2018-08-06 15:53:53 Also tell everyone oil can get them off the glue traps !! I used Pam spray to get one off and freed him/her.
4866 2018-08-06 15:53:52 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease.
4867 2018-08-06 15:53:48 The KSA shills are out in full force. 
I am very much looking forward to the KSA running out of oil. The rest of the world will be better off for it.
4868 2018-08-06 15:53:46 All the main cast members have Wikipedia pages (Thomas as "Ernest Lee Thomas"). Thomas is still acting, Nelson is in oil/gas tech, and Berry died in 2003.
4869 2018-08-06 15:53:40 There's more interest to Israel/US/NATO(France, UK, etc) and their Arab sattelite states than oil, gas and other resources. There is a neverending economic, cultural and military resistance in ME by Iran-Syria-Hezbollah and Russia under Putin that they have to take care of.

4871 2018-08-06 15:53:39 The 9/11 bombers were from the KSA, but hey, they got oil, so it’s cool.
4872 2018-08-06 15:53:37 After I finish up the oil cooler and brake swap on the Exocet I’m going to park any additional car projects for a while. It feels like the Exocet has become my identity and I have forgotten how to be myself out side of that.

4874 2018-08-06 15:53:22 1)  Foreign reserves rose to $ 47 dollars under Buhari, the same reserves that fell to $34 Under GEJ at a period oil price was high. 2) It took 16 years to start Abuja metro line by pdp Govt, it took Baba 3 years to finish it. 3) Ajaokuta-itakpe rail line is being revived.
4875 2018-08-06 15:53:14 Spartan's Den Beard Oil is great and smells amazing.

4883 2018-08-06 15:52:22 Finally getting an oil change after being 2,000+ miles over 
4884 2018-08-06 15:51:59 Why should Americans give up their homes to ship Canadian Oil to Saudi Refinery in Texas so refined oil can be shipped overseas while US workers pay higher prices at the pump????  

Can you explain
4885 2018-08-06 15:51:55 
4886 2018-08-06 15:51:34 And please to the Canadian act like we do not have oil anymore and show us what you can do :)
4887 2018-08-06 15:51:03 Stop working for Putin, the oil isn't worth it.  #MoneyGrubber
4888 2018-08-06 15:51:01 the others are staying n committed partially as the EU investment bank said is too risky to invest.and oil and gas all need.
4889 2018-08-06 15:50:44 Yes! Use our surplus instead. I'd support an increase in costs over importing oil from Saudi
4890 2018-08-06 15:50:42 So I’m waiting for my oil to get changed and I hear a kid in the bathroom singing in my feelings for about 20 minutes straight and his dad had to get a master key to get him out and make him stop singing. You can’t make this stuff up
4891 2018-08-06 15:50:36 One wonders if the House of Saud trade ban will last long enough to affect oil imports to Eastern Canada. It might be time for them to have a lesson about energy dependence and what they might have done differently instead of attacking Alberta. #cdnpoli

4895 2018-08-06 15:50:06 You should have read the details.... there is production, and there is supply... supply = production + oil from storage
4896 2018-08-06 15:50:00 On the one hand, I like beard oil because my face itches at times.  On the other hand, fuck smelling like a hippie, unless of course you are trying to get with a hot hippie chick.

4898 2018-08-06 15:49:59 At the time I thought she dealt it with it quite well. That's until she started Whatsapp'ing me the spurious articles about coconut oil she'd tag me in before.
4899 2018-08-06 15:49:58 I love this oil! 
4900 2018-08-06 15:49:50 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.

ถ้าจะมาเดี๋ยวออยรอก็ได้ครับ
4902 2018-08-06 15:49:31 Next: can we get the Trans Mountain Pipeline NOW?  Canada gets 10% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. We cannot be dependent on them when we have our own.

4911 2018-08-06 15:48:25 Sorry, but you ever telling porkies or reading too much nonsense pumped out by your #SNP  eejit pals are HQ.oil revenues took a 97% drop in 2016 about £60 million income. Scotland receives all its oil revenues within its geographical area.Non to #WM You really need to check facts
4912 2018-08-06 15:48:24 Explosives only works effectively with oil well fires.
4913 2018-08-06 15:48:24 Chalk i guess. Def not oil
4914 2018-08-06 15:48:18 Add a teaspoon or two of coconut oil to your green tea for a combination of health benefits. This is particularly helpful to those of you who are new to intermittent fasting, carb cycling, or doing the latter two on and off. As well as for keto/LCHF and low carb ways of eating.

4917 2018-08-06 15:48:04 So they've always been after their oil, it now explains it. And they even tried to kill him for it.
4918 2018-08-06 15:48:03 Sure would be nice not to be reliant on Saudi oil right about now
4919 2018-08-06 15:47:56 InfoChip has been creating custom #RFID solutions for Oil & Gas fields for years. We strive to make the perfect tag for every situation.
4920 2018-08-06 15:47:44 Nothing new today. I really do not want more attention.  Those account look like they are selling snake oil. Guess, cuz they are.  However, I was thinking I would get a half dozen.
4921 2018-08-06 15:47:43 Certainly the cheap AKs are not domestic.
4922 2018-08-06 15:47:29 Ivan really woke me up at 7am to WATCH HIM CHANGE HIS OIL...
4923 2018-08-06 15:47:29 Oh like the decals men put on their video game controllers? Or the expensive rims on cheap vehicles? Or the expensive beard oil yall buy with not a stubble of beard to sit on?
4924 2018-08-06 15:47:26 Yeah the world really don’t need Saudi. About time we stop making business together.  Wahab oil is so dirty
4925 2018-08-06 15:47:23 Thank you Oomf. Plantain and palm oil it is for dinner tonight.
4926 2018-08-06 15:47:16 Yeah i had hormonal acne so the oil helped in balancing my hormones and the Zinc helps with fighting acne from within(more like assist the immune system). Would really advice that you treat acne from inside to outside
4927 2018-08-06 15:47:10 So back to Mosadeq, nationalized oil production, and democratically elected socialism? Or do you mean a return to the tyrannical puppet Shah?
4928 2018-08-06 15:46:58 Well, it wasn't Rally Chicken's oil.
4929 2018-08-06 15:46:54 Oil Prices Continue to Rise as Saudi Arabia Production Slows.

4930 2018-08-06 15:46:52 Hi there, the road isn't actually closed at the moment. We have traffic passing via the hard shoulder only. Lanes 2 and 3 have been significantly damaged by the hard shoulder and lane 1 is covered by an oil spillage so unfortunately we can't open any lanes.
4931 2018-08-06 15:46:50 Irrelevant.
Only a small percentage of oil imports to eastern Canada comes from Saudi Arabia.
4932 2018-08-06 15:46:47 To keep National Parks safe from fires, they must be strip mined and drilled to remove the flammable coal and oil. Too bad Scott Pruit isn’t around to give Secretary Ryan Zinke the green light on that. 
4933 2018-08-06 15:46:43 Until 100 years ago, Norway was basically ruled by Sweden and incredibly poor.

Norway has a lot of oil, a public oil company which everyone owns shares in and a population of 5 million people.
4934 2018-08-06 15:46:43 Time to stop selling them armored vehicles, stop buying their oil and use ours instead!
4935 2018-08-06 15:46:40 Listen little here little gooner....there are only two types of people in football who are not city fans. First there are the racists who like to point out we have Arab/oil money..is that you? Secondly there are jealous people who are salty? So which are you? Please share...

4939 2018-08-06 15:45:56 Is Saudi oil coming in to Irving Canaport by ship? How about a pipeline from Alberta to Saint John?
4940 2018-08-06 15:45:56 James philanthropy= providing education for the marginalized;
The Moron in Chief's philanthropy = used his charitable foundation to purchase an oil painting of himself for himself.
4941 2018-08-06 15:45:54 Natural oils. I use jojoba oil because it’s closest to our natural oil we produce. We don’t wash it often. I actually wash mine when i feel like it lol. Try DIY deep conditioners too. Grape seed oil, tea teee oil, and almond oil is also good for the hair
4942 2018-08-06 15:45:37 We need oil? That's why, it has nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the economy, & energy needs. Companies will work on renewable sources, but it needs to be as cost effective or moreso than oil for it to overtake it.
4943 2018-08-06 15:45:33 Oil is flying . . . $TGC past oil runner. $1.13 break is key

4946 2018-08-06 15:45:21 Any issues with “Federal Agencies”? Really?! How about in terms people actually think?! Issues such as: 1)New Iran sanctions that will increase oil to $300 a barrel and bring gas to $5 a gallon 2)How to protect voting against Russian interference 3)Tariffs so farmers can’t sell?!
4947 2018-08-06 15:45:20 Well they need to stop the geoengineering that's what's causing the drought. They are doing it on purpose. Water is the new oil. They're selling weather derivatives on Wall Street now. Just another racket. The aerosols dry out the atmosphere
4948 2018-08-06 15:45:16 A trust is illegal as well and there's precedent to prove it from Standard Oil to Ma Bell

4958 2018-08-06 15:44:24 Aye lad could spend the rest of me life putting oil on @JennaLynnMeowri 's ass for her pics an there'd be no complaints from me.  Don't need no pay I'd be homeless, clocking in with the lotion an then back to the streets. Day done.
4959 2018-08-06 15:44:20 Awesome to see you!! Thanks for ALL the support! Wish we were on podium but, not far off.
4960 2018-08-06 15:44:19 Oh great the price of oil will go up and still haven’t heard any details on why it was a bad deal? Saying it is one thing, proving it is another.

4963 2018-08-06 15:44:11 Maybe the Feds should be a little more diplomatic with their virtue signalling. Else Saudi Arabia could shut off oil delivery and then Maritimes & Quebec will come to a standstill. It’s not like we’re building Energy East to stop our reliance on Saudi imports. Your move Quebec.
4964 2018-08-06 15:44:07 Amende do problem moto cam semput2 kat rpm tinggi ni, oil filter ka
4965 2018-08-06 15:43:50 It is an outrage how cozy we are always seem to be with Saudi Arabia.  WHY? We increasingly have alternatives for oil, they are a despotic regime, and they consistently undermine human and women's rights.  What gives?

4969 2018-08-06 15:43:44 Iran holds the world's 4th largest crude oil reserves & doesn't want to use the petrodollar = threat to the hegemony of the US dollar. A war with Iran will lead to increased oil prices which benefit Saudi Arabia & Russia. Then there is the conflict between Iran & Israel.

4974 2018-08-06 15:43:10 We had an agreement with Iran. We didn't need crushing sanctions that will make oil prohibitively expensive. Trump & his usefull idiots did this. All of it.
4975 2018-08-06 15:43:03 I can live with "the @GOP committed treason for political power and oil".

It'll be the most Republican explanation for it.
4976 2018-08-06 15:42:59 All investments involve time horizons. Particularly energy infrastructure. Oil companies are perfectly capable of managing those time horizons (and people do this all the time too with saving). It's just that acting on climate screws up their ROI. So they'd rather delay.

4986 2018-08-06 15:42:17 @joerogan I think the pyramids were originally meant to contain oil that began leaking a long time ago as containment structures that got more complex over time
4987 2018-08-06 15:42:16 Honest question tho: what exactly are we to do with used oil?

4998 2018-08-06 15:41:08 You can make cucumber, onion and tomato salad with rice vinegar.  Or you could make tzatziki - cucumber, mint, strained yogurt, garlic, olive oil, and sometimes lemon or vinegar depending on your taste.  It is absolutely delicious on sandwiches and as dips or just by itself.
4999 2018-08-06 15:41:08 We actually export oil to stupid animals
5000 2018-08-06 15:41:04 Why the heck are we importing oil from the Saudis. They sponsor terrorism and endorses Wahhabism.
5001 2018-08-06 15:41:04 So, now you’re saying a Canada First oil strategy is a bad idea?
5002 2018-08-06 15:40:58 Putting baby oil in my hair was a great idea to get my extensions out but 5 washes later and it’s STILL greasy
5003 2018-08-06 15:40:40 一度思ったら頭から離れなくてw
5004 2018-08-06 15:40:39 Saudi Arabia supplies oil to the Irving refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick. 
Oil is imported into the USA as Canadian Oil but its source was Middle East.
If IRAN closes Hormuz the Irving Oil flow stops to USA and so does cheap imports to USA's East Coast.
5005 2018-08-06 15:40:32 Seeing the smoke from Borneo all the way inside Singapore from the burning forest trees to make way for the many palm oil plantations.. I could go on & on cus this person is seriously weird, but I can tell you I wont be following a certain orangutan master any more !!

5010 2018-08-06 15:39:34 Speaking of logical fallacies, state-controlled industry is quite the slippery slope. 

Oil is purchased from whomever can deliver the needed product at the cheapest cost.  And, yet, people seem mad at how the free market works and demand their government to change the outcome.
5011 2018-08-06 15:39:28 the western world stands for peace, if you ignore their support for apartheid israel, their back-door support for ISIS in the proxy war in Syria, the millions killed in Iraq for oil on the basis of fake intelligence. not to mention lybia, or yemen. bombing for peace everywhere
5012 2018-08-06 15:39:20 They use the vape with thc oil. It's not nicotine they want.

5015 2018-08-06 15:38:59 We understand your jealousy and the fire  burning inside your chest. But trust me you can do nothing else than adding more oil to it. Think about it.
5016 2018-08-06 15:38:56 We have oil we have natural gas we are a bread basket for the world we have water we have lumber....we have it all...we need nothing from you!

5021 2018-08-06 15:38:31 I know, I love it too except for the palm oil they use - so I am leaving it. :-(

I am giving Oasis general purpose liquid soap a try. Unfortunately, they don't make a bar soap. I suppose I could start making my own, lord knows there's enough waste veggie oil around at all times.
5022 2018-08-06 15:38:31 1 part vinegar + 3 parts olive oil=the perfect vinaigrette. 
5023 2018-08-06 15:38:24 Why is he using beard oil? Dont tell me he is on a fucking shaving profile.
5024 2018-08-06 15:38:19 Fela is indeed a motivational speaker who has done well. Atiku became a business man at the back of his job as a custom officer.Tinubu was an oil exec and Sowore was a Unilag student unionist.We will love to be corrected. Anyone out there on Sowore at Unilag, pls do chip in
5025 2018-08-06 15:38:14 The rules and traditions are not so clear cut. Canada was right about South Africa, and has been wrong about Israel. Most countries are inconsistent, depending on their interests. Saudi Arabia has been given a free ride because of oil.
5026 2018-08-06 15:38:13 The trade deficit in goods and services came in at $46.3 billion in June, very close to the consensus expected $46.5 billion. 
 
 Exports fell $1.5 billion, led by passenger cars and pharmaceuticals.  Imports rose $1.6 billion, led by pharmaceuticals and crude oil.

5031 2018-08-06 15:37:51 Saudi Arabia is picking and choosing what trades can be done so they receive all the shipments of the Army equipment contract. It is now upto the Cdn govt. to tell them where to go. We do not need their oil.
5032 2018-08-06 15:37:45 You mean American hypocrisy about everything, like blaming others for things that they made a million times worse and million times more. Or praising cia and muller who literally lied about Iraq and killed millions of innocent people over lies and oil
5033 2018-08-06 15:37:17 Untuk sektor kenapa sawit sekarang dah ada MSPO (Malaysia Sustainable Palm Oil) yang mandatory untuk diambil boleh semua grower Palm Oil.. Inisiatif MPOB melalui MPOCC untuk tangani company kelapa sawit yang suka gondolkan area2 macam ni.. Hehe

5036 2018-08-06 15:36:28 Oil is the easy answer. Venezuala, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait's oil production dwarfs Russia. 

Unless, the World is headed to war, and the USA has just aligned with Russia against our allies.

5050 2018-08-06 15:35:27 We really need to stop buying oil from the Saudi.  I will never understand why parts of Canada think supporting our responsibly run Canadian oil companies is worse than buying this regime #ilovecanadianenergy

Or is big oil dirty $$$ enough for you to sell out everything America stands for? Every single one of you will go down as traitors @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
5053 2018-08-06 15:35:16 Here's what I cooked today: My brother's sweet pizza.  Ingredients: coca-cola, cornstarch, worcestershire sauce, coca-cola, thinly sliced onion, oil, water, green pea, and salt.

5059 2018-08-06 15:35:05 There is so much wrong with that statement. Jones is no where comparable to say Rachel Maddow or Cooper Anderson. Jones is just a rwnj who sells snake oil (literally) to the must gullible. He is a "performance artist" not a journalist.
5060 2018-08-06 15:35:03 And they do it under the banner of tolerance and love.
5061 2018-08-06 15:35:02 い…いきてる…！
5062 2018-08-06 15:34:55 once again Kunstler is wrong (eg peak oil). there's a lot more idiocy to go in the SJW bullshit levels.
5063 2018-08-06 15:34:41 Do your part stop using oil and anything that comes from it. If you're unwilling to do this then stop complaining.

5067 2018-08-06 15:34:27 Yes breast milk having all the nutrients from water , fat/oil,protein, carbohydrates, vitamins etc in their pure state. Bond between mother and child. Highly economical. Burns fat on the mother.
5068 2018-08-06 15:34:17 You can also decant from bad bottles to cool swingtop brewing bottles and feel like a kitchen alchemist. No one but me knows how cheap my olive oil is.
5069 2018-08-06 15:34:08 Tea tree oil tbs?
5070 2018-08-06 15:34:06 One can only hope. The Saudis see the writing on the wall. The real value of oil is plummeting much faster that expected. Renewables have already made huge I roads in Europe and the technology is rapidly getting g better and cheaper. The death-knell of oil is starting to ring.
5071 2018-08-06 15:34:04 Nigga oil changes probably $7 
5072 2018-08-06 15:34:03 Do your part stop using oil and anything that comes from it. If you're unwilling to do this then stop complaining.
5073 2018-08-06 15:33:55 because they get cheap oil?

5079 2018-08-06 15:33:06 JFK was killed because of his conspiracy theory about secret societies. He saw what we see now. Skull N Bones>Bush Families Bush Sr. Was in Dallas when JFK killed. They like War because they make money. They own Oil/Gas. Look to Bush Sr Fathers story.
5080 2018-08-06 15:33:05 That would get the pipeline east built in a hurry if quebec runs out of oil
5081 2018-08-06 15:32:58 And another will come along and takes it's place. Such is the life cycle of snake oil.
5082 2018-08-06 15:32:57 Just wish the UK would too.
Obviously too big a customer for UK military hardware to risk upsetting over human rights, or is it the oil the UK Government is worried about.
HUMAN RIGHTS MATTER, I call on the UK Government to follow Canada's lead on this issue. Do the right thing
5083 2018-08-06 15:32:55 have the dept of justice

5084 2018-08-06 15:32:54 WTI oil price - already up considerably this morning - has risen about 30 cents higher since the White House announced Iran sanctions were back on.
5085 2018-08-06 15:32:27 Exactly who wants Trump to eliminate these admission rule? The automakers? the oil industry? or is it just Trump trying to dismantle everything that President Obama passed? Watch out Alaskans he'll be up there naming Mt. Denali, Mt. Trump, OMG

5090 2018-08-06 15:32:13 High oil price effects:
1) Increases transportation cost. That increases prices of goods, especially the food items where transport cost is significant component of price => Higher inflation.

2) Increases import bill. Reduces dollar holding by RBI => Weaker Rupee.
5091 2018-08-06 15:32:03 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.

5109 2018-08-06 15:30:45 Perhaps the United States should  adopt a similar law and place 2% of all oil sales from within the U.S. into the Social Security fund until it is solvent.
5110 2018-08-06 15:30:36 Maersk Container Lines sent 2 supply tugs to Turkey for scrap, and mysterious they both sank off France.

5118 2018-08-06 15:30:07 Irresponsible President Trump just paid off Russia again by breaking our Nation's agreement with Iran, without cause. The sanctions imposed will raise the cost of oil benefiting the Russian Economy at the expense of the USA economy and working American Families. Disgusting!

5126 2018-08-06 15:29:01 Sanctions against Iran at the cost of NATO ( Europe ), while China continues to purchase Iranian oil, means gain of Iran and loss of USA. America has isolated itself and strengthened the hands of Iranian regime - result of not using state dept!

5133 2018-08-06 15:28:31 I have no argument with that approach. I just challenge the implication that naturopathic/alternative treatments are little more than snake oil and quackery.
5134 2018-08-06 15:28:27 Oil Man wants to be like Sheep Man as practice for what's to come
5135 2018-08-06 15:28:13 It’s embarrassing that America led the world politically and thru Capitalism since 1945 and at the end all we did was bring the world to the edge of existence.  We sold nature for cents on the $ to greedy capitalists like oil coal etc and fought solar!
5136 2018-08-06 15:28:08 Oil company executive...however, if this refers to the list I posed. It will be a skewed representation of facts.

5142 2018-08-06 15:27:51 sanctions have been key to driving up oil prices...
5143 2018-08-06 15:27:45 In the 20th century, only Europe, the US, and Japan used great amounts of coal, oil, etc. for energy in electricity generation and and as fuels of cars and resources in industries.

In the 21st century, China and others have joined this community, raising temperature.

5145 2018-08-06 15:27:37 SAUDI ARABIA has 40% of world oil. Your info is really poor !Saudi arabia has the two holy places where muslim every year gather in it. Canada imports oil from saudis .Lets us how that will affect you in coming days.wait for More tax man
5146 2018-08-06 15:27:27 "시간이 우리를 갈라놓을 때까지."
5147 2018-08-06 15:27:20 No, we need to nationalize the oil and refine it for our people.
5148 2018-08-06 15:27:17 We gave away the gate after butch Stewart tried for yrs with that gate. If it was so viable y he needed govt help? Y did he eventually gave up? Govt sold out airJ stop trying to split air. They sold it out because we couldn't compete. Oil price skyrocketed in 2008
5149 2018-08-06 15:27:15 Ahh ok 
You take:
1 large onion
5-6 garlic cloves and some oil and heat up the pan
Then you add the meat and let it simmer till it's all brown
Then add 2 cans of shredded tomato and some oregano, salt and pebber to taste - let it simmer for a bit and it's done!
5150 2018-08-06 15:27:15 According to Cray recent improvement in the price of oil has increased capital plans confidence, which includes supercomputer and storage solutions. The #HPC vendor is optimistic about 2019-2020. #datacenter #server #supercomputing
5151 2018-08-06 15:27:14 Walmart literally wanted $60 for a tire meanwhile I came to my regular place and I’m getting a oil change and a new tire for $79 
5152 2018-08-06 15:27:13 It’s ALL for his master Putin. Putin needs oil to be a certain price/barrel to turn a profit. Reports say that is $85/barrel + . This TRAITOROUS FRAUD declared financial war on American citizens from the first day.
5153 2018-08-06 15:27:11 A senior #US official told media that Washington aims at taking #Iran oil exports to zero, working individually with different countries.
5154 2018-08-06 15:27:07 Cooking shirtless is dope and all until oil squirts on u
5155 2018-08-06 15:27:07 ...Venezuela might (big “might” here) increase oil production by taking extreme fiscal measures but will receive much less rent (much less) at the expense of its own people.
5156 2018-08-06 15:27:04 Energy products seek markets. EE or other would displace incoming Saudi oil and particularly so if combined with political backing. 

You should be able to see the downside of buying oil from a corrupt absolute monarchy opposed to human rights. Tanker loads add to the irony.

5159 2018-08-06 15:26:38 Im sorry, I love my oils but the acrylic process just seems to shit on the oil process time and time again due to dry speed and hue control 
5160 2018-08-06 15:26:30 These oil companies make a lot of profit and they still could make major profits while lowering the cost of oil and therefore lowering gas prices.
5161 2018-08-06 15:26:21 @BelindaFettke I just posted the lamb I put in the slow cooker with celery, mushroom, macadamia nut oil and herbs...it’s one of our favorites!

5163 2018-08-06 15:26:10 Where are you in that battle against these parties all supported by irani money? I haven't heard condemnation from any of u when Saudi oil tanker was attacked by Yemeni rebels supported by Iran?Or when Saudi citizens got killed from Yemeni attacks or when our capital was attacked
5164 2018-08-06 15:26:08 What If they then move to iran for oil only to be brought into war because they will go against the inbargo? Canada will be left with no defence and no energy
5165 2018-08-06 15:26:02 It's a little late in the day here for coffee... but it's never too late to get the good oil from @Hodor7777. Excuse for a double shot in the morning ;)
5166 2018-08-06 15:26:02 Takes about 35 years of economic and oil dropping from $140 to $40 ... and all it takes is one Obama to undermine decades of effort & global coordination.
5167 2018-08-06 15:26:02 US lifted a 40 year ban on US oil exports.  Now the Iran sanctions..  The US will fill the gap.. by design.

5169 2018-08-06 15:25:43 When Canada imports smaller quantities of oil from other countries than the U.S. it is purely out of strategy. It is a geopolitical move, to bond, keep or create ties in strategic regions. But Canada is not overly dependent on their oil.
5170 2018-08-06 15:25:40 Already got an oil change this morning and it’s not even 8:30
5171 2018-08-06 15:25:38 Is there any unintentional self harm more cruel than tea tree oil face wash in the eye?
5172 2018-08-06 15:25:37 Dear food industry, this is your annual reminder that sliced raw tomatoes—whether in a bowl or on toast, or decorated with sea salt, olive oil, aleppo pepper, seeds, herbs or anything else in your wide, impressive spice collection—do not constitute a f*cking recipe. Thank you.

5176 2018-08-06 15:24:55 I deep condition weekly with heat and oil my scalp every few days. I also use the LCO method when styling.
5177 2018-08-06 15:24:53 I could cover my entire body with every repellent, bracelet, and oil, and dangle citronella candles from each lobe & limb and still walk away eaten alive. #MosquitoesHateMe Little bastards.

5185 2018-08-06 15:24:08 #AMER #AmerisurResources is a mature and profitable oil company that has reached the dividend paying stage of its development. It's unlikely to be acquired for a major premium and has no need to make acquisitions. Cash distributions are in the best interests of investors.
5186 2018-08-06 15:24:06 It's not the oil sold to Canada/US, it's virtually ALL the oil sold IN THE WORLD! Among countries that have tried to escape the  #Petrodollar régime: #Iraq, #Syria, #Libya, #Iran, #NKorea & #Venezuela. 
Yes, total #coincidence. 
The US economy is totally dependent on world #Oil.
5187 2018-08-06 15:24:04 Why the hell are you promoting this snake oil salesman?
5188 2018-08-06 15:23:57 Virtue signaling is a psychological disorder. It causes people to live in a fantasy world to escape the realities of life with which they cannot cope. Compare volcanic eruptions to oil spills to get a dose of reality

5191 2018-08-06 15:23:43 Let's C. Canada has their own oil. Canada is more or less the manufacturing centre of the Western hemisphere. What does Canada need from the Saudis again? What could 'embolden' Saudis like this? Look 2Ur neighbour on Ur Southern border. They own that 'leader's soninlaw,they said.

5196 2018-08-06 15:23:06 Oil is worth even more to them. The idea the Brits or US love black Zimbabweans is crazy. Since when? Remember the 80s when 1000s died?

5201 2018-08-06 15:22:58 Here are some GREAT numbers:
- Oil prices rising (more in 90 days because of foolish Iran move by you)
- Coke raised prices
- Harley moving abroad
- White goods prices rising.
- Solar prices rising.
- Healthcare prices rising.

- WAGES stagnant! 
- Jobs being lost to tariffs.
5202 2018-08-06 15:22:53 I loved Annihilation. If they asked me for a pull quote I'd say "I watched it five days ago and I'm still arguing with my girlfriend over the meaning of a thingy that looks like someone spilled oil in a puddle."

5206 2018-08-06 15:22:41 How much oil do you use ?
5207 2018-08-06 15:22:40 All of the arguments for EE and “ethical oil” argue that Canadians should be buying oil produced in Canada. 

This implies some form of government intervention. A national programme for energy, or some other, similar moniker.
5208 2018-08-06 15:22:34 We need to demand that labels specify if they use palm oil and/or experiment on animals!!! Sadly some non-sentient beings are ruling countries.
5209 2018-08-06 15:22:32 And we’re still dependent on their oil thanks to jr.
5210 2018-08-06 15:22:27 Pake.. purivera botanica, sabun organik akuna, aloe vera, tea tree oil.... Hadeh banyak lah. Ga cocok pake masker kaya gituuu
5211 2018-08-06 15:22:23 can't we just take shots of olive oil like on the americans?
5212 2018-08-06 15:22:19 Bele oil, Nouvelle sorte huile?
5213 2018-08-06 15:22:17 You're right. Oil just powers everything used to harvest, transport, store, cook and build everything.
5214 2018-08-06 15:22:13 I walked off a job once where customer wouldn’t let me on their drive. Thought my van would drop oil.
5215 2018-08-06 15:22:05 Well it looks like it has powdery mildew, spray with horticultural oil (according to label instructions)

They were as rich as the USA before Che then the government seized the oil and the fun began. Now they outlawed calling starvation, starvation

5227 2018-08-06 15:20:57 Wages are nominal at best. Cost of oil going up which means higher prices at the pumps. Prices of goods & service going up. You’re enacting polices that hurt the common worker & line big Corp. pockets. You need to focus on wage growth & not the economy.
5228 2018-08-06 15:20:47 Must be that high octane Saudi oil.
5229 2018-08-06 15:20:47 My is on the US economy......I'm not sure why Trump is picking fights with everyone?

5243 2018-08-06 15:20:07 Looks like you won't have to alter the recipe at all. Maybe cook in oil for slightly less time since there is no skin to provide insulation. So start with a hot pan rather than cold.
5244 2018-08-06 15:20:04 Look for oil slick...

5245 2018-08-06 15:20:03 Mga kumpanya ng langis, magpapatupad ng oil price rollback
5246 2018-08-06 15:20:00 Solved our problems by selling off council houses and not building any new ones, by selling off our North Sea oil reserves instead of investing like Norway, by destroying manufacturing in the North and deregulating the City leading to growing inequality in the UK...
5247 2018-08-06 15:19:59 Overall we are growing rapidly. Whether Nigerians consume Indonesian palm oil or Japenese, it impacts Orang Utans equally. This is a global economy.

5260 2018-08-06 15:19:28 I would have to disagree, don't see these markets as being well supplied, actually the opposite. Oil is looking for 80 and that's without tension in the middle east. Shale is a lie and will exposed for what it is.
5261 2018-08-06 15:19:27 @CBDOilSolutions interested in the theory of CBD oil in Autism? How does it work? Xx
5262 2018-08-06 15:19:24 The time to have started panicking and get off our asses and start doing was long ago.But we didn’t listen to scientists but instead listened to big oil and corporations with their selfserving messages cause they reinforced that we humans didn’t need to change. Survival mode now.

5265 2018-08-06 15:19:15 the industrial need to extract bitumen from oil sands, alone, is the proof the collapse is near 
idk how we even letted that happen, and with we i mean boomers
5266 2018-08-06 15:19:15 No they don't include ethnicity or religion & that's not the point I made. Transparency exists so that there is accountability ie conflict of interesta. Eg receiving money from tobacco firms & voting in their interest, as has happened. Or Oil companies etc

5284 2018-08-06 15:18:03 If I stop moving I'm like the tin man without his oil can. Gotta keep moving. Just not too much. Lol!!

5293 2018-08-06 15:17:22 spot on, Labour and Tory made sure the #McCroneReport was buried, marked 'Top Secret' in a vault and used Scottish money for any purpose other than improvements in Scotland
it's no joke that Scotland is the only country to discover oil and get poorer as a result

5296 2018-08-06 15:17:15 It is not difficult to know that the U.S. is actually Canada’s main source of oil and to understand why. But I really can’t understand why you thought half of it is coming from KSA. It is epic.

5298 2018-08-06 15:17:08 Playing chicken with Iran  may not be smart. They need only sink a supertanker in the Strait of Hormuz to cripple global oil markets.
5299 2018-08-06 15:17:06 Imported oil. Without it we're all in darkness.
5300 2018-08-06 15:16:55 SA isn't boycotted because they have oil. Women are treated as property, jailed for driving until recently, and gay men are commonly flogged or put to death. Harper sold CDN Wheat Comm. & made an arms deal (LAV) w/ SA, so he might be orchestrating this tantrum from backstage.
5301 2018-08-06 15:16:46 Teslas need oil. Wheel bearings, transmissions, and moving parts all require petroleum products.
5302 2018-08-06 15:16:36 What will cost the economy more, a rise in oil and gas prices or global instability due to climate change? We are already seeing the impacts with stronger more regular hurricanes and wildfires and droughts. You're thinking short term gains for long term pains.
5303 2018-08-06 15:16:34 I get randomly drug tested at work (DOT required, sorta, mostly just stupid work culture choice by our nerd overlords), so hanging in places w other ppl smoking weed triggers anxiety, which I’m working on. 
But fuck yeah 1&2.
5304 2018-08-06 15:16:32 Hope it helps! It’s natural and will kill bacteria (and hopefully whatever is causing this!). Could also use coconut oil or aloe Vera as moisturizer in the meantime until it heals.

5313 2018-08-06 15:15:17 I don't know why the Russians would force the Democrats to join Trump's GOP plan for oil & gas drilling on public lands, do you?
5314 2018-08-06 15:15:12 sama sama! yang innisfree tu oil cleanser tau, dia dalam pump bottle
5315 2018-08-06 15:15:06 Honourable virtue signaling. But if the Fed Liberals aren’t more diplomatic, SA could stop selling us oil which will obviously cost Maritimes & Quebec tremendously. Another reason for Quebec to stop blocking Energy East pipeline. Canada need not rely on oil from Middle East.
5316 2018-08-06 15:15:01 If we can pipe oil halfway across the country. . . why can't we pipe water from the Midwest, where it floods every freaking year, to the West so that Cali, Nevada, Arizona can have some?
Build some storage, and Voilà.

5320 2018-08-06 15:14:44 Wonder, just how much oil does Canada need from other sources? Yes, Cda exports but most the cash goes into corporate pockets. So what if...we just turn that tap inwards while supporting more alternatives until regressive/repressive regimes such as U.S. n SA respects us again?
5321 2018-08-06 15:14:37 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified
5322 2018-08-06 15:14:36 Your information is inaccurate. You see there is a serious problem. You have to open the doors to information versus propaganda & to accept criticism. Oil imports in Canada in 2016: United-States 62%, Saudi Arabia 9%, Algeria 9%, Nigeria 8%, Norway 4%. Canada can live without KSA

5324 2018-08-06 15:14:18 Yeah man, one of Reagan's first moves was to take solar panels OFF the White House, claiming they weren't dignifying. Of course, his vice president George Bush, was an oil man, imagine that.

5331 2018-08-06 15:13:26 On energy, it’s really not about hydrocarbons or renewables, but how to transition most effectively and quickly to a low carbon future. There are many possible positions other than that adopted by a denialist oil and gas shill like Lawson père.

5339 2018-08-06 15:12:19 We don’t need their oil we could complete a small section of pipeline trough Quebec... oh wait Liberals... sheesh.

5346 2018-08-06 15:11:53 Both times we replaced the oil but then blew the engine like others before me have.  Subaru says "sorry we can't help you!" Not a very concerned responsible organization!!
5347 2018-08-06 15:11:53 Oh, I thought that THC oil worked in all E-cig.
5348 2018-08-06 15:11:49 Depends. One of the theatres here in rural TX changed to reclining fatass pleather seats w assigned seating. It also sells beer and wine. Tix cost more but we never go to the other options now
5349 2018-08-06 15:11:43 Do you have a comment on the fact that the free world is siding with Saudi Arabia over us? Dry up our oil, and blow up theirs. We'll who actually wants to play.
5350 2018-08-06 15:11:40 Which is why we should refine our own oil & use our own petro products.
5351 2018-08-06 15:11:39 Isreal is doomed we need to keep a presence there Russia will feed there hunger for weapons and capitalism on there oil.

5359 2018-08-06 15:10:50 1. That doesn't answer my question; where is the opposition to the environmentally disastrous fracking happening in BC? 2. While the article refers to a Chinese duty slapped on LNG, you are talking only about oil, and I'm not. I'm talking about natural gas/LNG from fracking.
5360 2018-08-06 15:10:45 Our media is not Reckless and irresponsible. We do not sell snake oil, we do not sell fear.
5361 2018-08-06 15:10:42 Actually, it’s about oil and money. It always is.

Problem fixed.
5377 2018-08-06 15:09:26 These are recent vehicles from 2011-15 and you can google lawsuits US and one pending in Canada.  No warning lights go on and your engine is DRY of oil.  After twice happening in 6 weeks Subaru gave me a 2 wk appt.
5378 2018-08-06 15:09:23 Until recently, women were jailed for driving a car in SA. They did it on purpose, to attract the world's attention to the fact that women were treated as property there. What was the world's response? A few criticism, some from UN last week. Mostly: we need oil, so be it. 
5379 2018-08-06 15:09:22 So all the years of success are forgotten when you win something ? Tbf you probs supported us before city got the oil money.
5380 2018-08-06 15:09:18 Mr. President, the price of oil has to fall for the strengthening of the US economy. Saudi Arabia is not reliable. You need to sit at the table with Iran. The people of Iran are expecting it. Then you will be a strong president.
5381 2018-08-06 15:09:18 I think so. But for body scars I use dermatix and bio oil (:
5382 2018-08-06 15:09:03 You can use olive oil for shaving, too. Just saying. 
5383 2018-08-06 15:09:02 I think we should also be calling out Justin Trudeau for the continuing imprisonment of Indigenous activists protesting oil pipelines— it’s good to challenge Saudi Arabia about Raif Badawi, but stop imprisoning pipeline protestors, and land & water protectors.

5416 2018-08-06 15:07:15 The whole region imports from Argentina an LATAM. Less than 30% of crude edible oil is produced in SADC. Only Zambia is close to self sufficient with 300,000mt of Soya Output per year.

5431 2018-08-06 15:05:44 That is the direction technology is heading in.  Oil is used in many products however, it is not just cars.
5432 2018-08-06 15:05:38 that's some callous bullshit, right there. can we get locals (tech or otherwise) to raise funds to lock up rights to those lands? maybe put solar on them, while keeping the oil companies out?

5441 2018-08-06 15:05:00 It would be great if like minded countries put more of a mandate to move to electric vehicles and reduce use of oil. At some point that would have to have an impact on Saudi Arabia.
5442 2018-08-06 15:04:58 Reading Beshara Doumani on salam contracts for olive oil under the Ottomans reminds me of earlier Islamic contract law; of the Parable of the Manager in Luke 16; of the gift of Athena to Athens;  and of Thales’ clever oil-press futures contracts. So much depends on olives.

 Iraq is in a state of humanitarian crisis with 10 million people in need and more than 3 million internally displaced.
In 2014, poverty reached 22.5 percent nationwide.
Iraq economy is more critically dependent on one source- oil.

5468 2018-08-06 15:02:23 I wouldn't go that far. A lot of US oil sales are domestic, and there are many foreign markets besides China. Everyone wants oil, so it tends to find buyers.
Not to take away from the seriousness of the problem. But it's more China-Iran ties than threat to US oil producers.

"Don't build houses near me" can frig right off, however
5506 2018-08-06 14:59:44 Did they put new oil in after flushing? Car jerks when low to no oil then it will over heat and shut off.

5511 2018-08-06 14:59:31 The countries don’t need each other smart ass. They both have massive Oil reserves. And it’s not racist, Saudi isn’t a race. It’s a fact that KSA funds Wahabi schools. It’s a fact that the Bin Ladens were Saudi. It’s a fact that most of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudi.

5515 2018-08-06 14:59:13 This is based on what the corrupt Mexican government reports.
When looked into they leave out many of the guns are from overseas.
5516 2018-08-06 14:59:10 Only about 10% of imported oil to Canada or the US comes from Saudi Arabia. The idea we are tolerating them because of oil is wrong. Governments make active decisions to have positive interactions with the kingdom of Saud for reasons other than oil.

5528 2018-08-06 14:58:15 Stop saying it’s affordable to live enslaved to the oil industry!  If we encourage clean air vehicles and everyone gets in board those vehicles will later become the norm and less expensive and healthier for our planet.

5550 2018-08-06 14:56:46 @Kia 2.5 hours for a pre scheduled oil change ....... don’t know why this seems to always be happening at your Burlington, MA location.  If you can’t keep up with requests then do not schedule so many appointments that you can’t keep up. #alldayoilchange #wastedsaturday
5551 2018-08-06 14:56:46 Actually we are the smallest provider of illegal guns to those countries, they get many more from overseas.
Kills your “Hawaii” argument doesn’t it.
5552 2018-08-06 14:56:40 Need help yall. We took car in for oil change yesterday. They said engine needed to be flushed cuz of bad gunk. We did that. Bee drove today and car is jerking, and she said has to put pedal to the floor to get it to go 50 MPH. Where my mechanics at? Talk to me. Im all set

He knows he's a con artist His biggest fear is his ignorant voters catching on to his snake oil sales pitches while he robs the treasury blind and works toward privatization for massive profit with pay to play, etc.and screws over the USA.

5559 2018-08-06 14:56:26 We have our own oil.  We need pipelines and refinery capacity so Canadians across the nation can profit on our oil resources.

5563 2018-08-06 14:56:11 This data is old but all I found so far:
“Traced guns come from many countries across the globe. However, 78% of guns that were traced in 1994 originated in the United States and most of the rest were from Brazil (5%) Germany (3%) China (3%) Austria (3%) Italy (2%) Spain (2%)”

5565 2018-08-06 14:56:05 It Will End When The Pipeline Is Built And The Oil Is Flowing, Don't You Worry.
5566 2018-08-06 14:56:01 Follow the money. Until the true cost of carbon is factored in (environmental damage, healthcare costs, etc.) then short-term profits for fossil fuel companies don't reflect the actual costs. IOW, oil/gas and GOP backers can continue passing off the worst impacts onto the public.

5571 2018-08-06 14:55:49 Wait, if it’s lax gun law states that are the problem, why isn’t the crime happening in the “lax gun law states”?
Also, Chicago gets most of its guns used in crime from in state, more than any other state.
You have to add up many “lax gun law” states to equal or exceed the amount

5578 2018-08-06 14:55:26 They live on public lands in the U.S. and private interests such as ranchers and the oil and mining industries want the land for businesses. Our government really doesn't care about managing the horses humanely anymore and would rather just get rid of them.

5582 2018-08-06 14:55:03 They had no allies, no oil, their war machine was annihilated. And the war had to be won by obliterating civilians instead of non combatants? It was to show then Russians some muscle.
5583 2018-08-06 14:55:03 We have been turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia for decades.  It has the worst human rights record in the Middle East and we do not need their oil.  It is also a source of extremism as we saw on 9/11. They are not a friend to Canada.
5584 2018-08-06 14:55:02 This is the kinda life some people are living, who are you deceiving?

Stop living FAKE LIFE, ORORO (palm oil ) NO BE CRUDE OIL.

But I handsome sha.....lols
5585 2018-08-06 14:54:59 So 10% of oil imports to Canada come from Saudi Arabia.   Yet we have enough of it in Canada.  Stop their imports and build the Canada East pipeline...problem solved.

5591 2018-08-06 14:54:07 China buying more Iranian oil.
1) Sanctions against Iran worked when everyone was in on them. Much less leverage now.
2) China also reducing energy purchases from US. Tariffs incentivized closer China-Iran economic ties.
3) Fighting everyone at once is dumb.
5592 2018-08-06 14:54:05 お疲れ様でした。男性キャラのコスプレの経験とかあるかと思ってたのですが。今後に期待ですね！
5593 2018-08-06 14:53:58 It has been three months since Trump pulled U.S. out of the six-nation nuclear agreement with Iran - which means new American sanctions are set to be imposed. Beginning tomorrow: industrial commodities, finance; in November (oil, shipping, port operations and more)

5599 2018-08-06 14:53:30 Good luck, people are stupid enough to listen to Andrew Wakefield and take his shit seriously. CVS is exploiting a market that doesn't trust the pharmaceutical industry by selling them snake oil... snake oil they'd buy elsewhere anyway.

5601 2018-08-06 14:53:21 @JustinTrudeau Mr. Prime Minister Sir, how are you going to stand up for Canada is light of the latest slap from Saudi Arabia?  Can we cut off their oil imports and boost our own oil production?
5602 2018-08-06 14:53:14 Dude Infowars has violated the rules on Facebook for a long ass time now, it's more surprising that the rampant lying, insinuations of violence, and snake oil supplements haven't gotten you assclowns banned before.

5611 2018-08-06 14:52:28 Yeah, you just tried to sell nothing but snake oil. No one should join an "idea" that is solely based on exposure. And trying to propose something that doesn't exist yet is the sole reason you should never be trusted. 

Next time make sure you have a working product first.
5612 2018-08-06 14:52:22 #CrudeOil is the only indicator I care for today, the rest is just noise. As long as oil keeps going higher,  #inflation will follow and take #Gold with it.

5622 2018-08-06 14:51:39 Is there a relation there?

5624 2018-08-06 14:51:08 This is an idiotic assertion. The BC NDP and the feds don't want pipelines. But it's very clear the Alberta NDP, like you, work for the oil companies. Rachel wants everything you want, but with humanity.

5636 2018-08-06 14:48:53 @1a  I agree 100% that oil companies r the sole beneficiary of rollbacks on fuel efficiency standards. Electric cars, solar and wind energy r the only way forward. We’ll always need petroleum, not at ALL the way we r currently ripping up nature though.

5642 2018-08-06 14:48:10 Do you even know the back story of Iran? Look up the Shah of Iran. He was very pro-America & did a great job modernizing Iran. Then U.S. oil barons whispered in Carter’s ear because THEY wanted Iran’s oil rights. We turned our back on the Shah & installed the terrorist nut jobs.

4. Now get a good clean razor and slowly shave your legs.

Maybe with any luck Saudi will cut off oil shipments to Canada and the  pristine Gulf of St.Lawrence will be protected.
5680 2018-08-06 14:45:23 Much better to be buying Saudi oil than Canadian tho. Wouldn't it be an interesting turn of events if eastern fuel prices spiked now? JT would probably give them a subsidy.

5688 2018-08-06 14:44:31 Yes! Those damned trees!  

We need to figure out how to stop them from being made of wood and leaves.

5694 2018-08-06 14:44:01 Loving this episode of Sawbones on CBD oil. Rachel McElroy's call for a clear-headed analysis of whether it has any actual medicinal properties outside of the placebo effect of "marijuana is medicinal therefore the technically legal byproduct must work."
5695 2018-08-06 14:43:58 The government in Norway takes 90% of the oil profit which is why they have such a high quality of life. Canadian citizens should benefit more than just a few temporary jobs
5696 2018-08-06 14:43:46 Since the EU is not following suit, and oil and money are both fungible, this only hurts US companies.

5701 2018-08-06 14:42:52 I’m pretty sure Thermo has just given up at this point.  Their new response to my service requests is “let’s find a day that’s mutually beneficial”. Um our pumps leaking oil, it would be beneficial to have it fixed ASAP  #MassSpec #Thermo #Confused
5702 2018-08-06 14:42:49 Wasn’t there some recent chest thumping against Venezuela that seemed to come out of nowhere? A graph surfaced on a Twitter yesterday showing Venezuela oil (production?) surpassing S.A.’s. I’m SURE there’s NO connection.

5721 2018-08-06 14:40:50 A lot of people get confused when I recommend avoiding seed/vegetable/nut oil. When asked I like pointing our that olive, coconut and avocado are fruits. Makes the heuristic easier for most people.

5746 2018-08-06 14:38:57 I am a novice in oil stocks....use a NPV calculator & a 10% discount rate, no terminal value, 6 yrs of production and cash flow net of decommissioning liabilities I get #RRE at 17% of its NPV. Feels very cheap to other names where I have used same assumptions.

5770 2018-08-06 14:37:09 What is happening today in the province of Ogadenia is a systematic policy and not coincidental given the importance of the Territory in terms of natural resources (oil and gas).

5848 2018-08-06 14:31:04 Mr. President, the price of oil has to fall for the strengthening of the US economy. Saudi Arabia is not reliable. You need to sit at the table with Iran. The people of Iran are expecting it. Then you will be a strong president.

5850 2018-08-06 14:30:47 I'm huge fan of socialist policies such as workers rights, living wage, free education, universal healthcare etc. But as we saw in oil rich Vanezuela, pure socialistic government may not be successful long term. I like the welafare states build in Europe after WWII.

5854 2018-08-06 14:30:33 This!

Shipping a single bottle of organic olive oil from Spain to the UK costs around 20 EUR, which is 2-3 times the value of the bottle itself :/

So now I'm having to ship a large quantity to the UK using alternative courier, and work with a local redistributor :(

5861 2018-08-06 14:29:34 While we are throwing trillions down the drain in the Middle East, the Chinese are investing.  The concern should not be on what the Chinese are doing but getting our priorities straight.  We are pumping enough oil.  Let Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and the rest go.
5862 2018-08-06 14:29:30 Today Today I going Simons and buy some valve oil for my trumpet.
I am about to take this thing to a whole other level.
5863 2018-08-06 14:29:28 If I feel like I’m coming down with something I take Airborne, and Black Seed oil. I feel so bomb afterwards.
5864 2018-08-06 14:29:18 The perfect time to stop buying Saudi oil and switch to Canadian oil as if we need an excuse  but this is the time.

5871 2018-08-06 14:28:16 First,Half of Canada used Saudi oil also there’s nothing impossible in this world and maybe Canada will achieve that, but it can’t be denied that it will be difficult and it will take s a lot of time and cost Canada a lot. 
I’m really feeling sorry about what happens !

5873 2018-08-06 14:28:11 Saudi’s expel our Diplomats, use Canadian made Military equipment on their own people yet Ont & Que buy their oil.
Venezuela’s Dictator kills his own people & arrests other politicians yet Que & Ont buy his oil.
Eastern Canadians have blood on their hands & still  nopipeline

5881 2018-08-06 14:27:22 Decided to come get my oil changed this morning and I’ve been here for almost 2 hours and I still have 2 cars in front of me.  FML
5882 2018-08-06 14:26:57 Auto fuel economy improvements are projected to have 6x the impact on oil demand than electric vehicles and have no offsetting CO2 emissions from power generation.  Yet, they get a fraction of the attention and capital investment.

5888 2018-08-06 14:26:22 since trade is also halted, I'm guessing Quebec won't be getting any Saudi oil anymore, do they turn to the US? or Alberta?  Winter is coming, what a time to be alive 
5889 2018-08-06 14:26:17 Please do your research before you come out with utter rubbish #ukog are not fracking. Oil has been found onshore in our great country, get behind it instead of trying to get in the way of it! #oilandgas #weald #Horsehill #GatwickGusher #oilbritannia

5895 2018-08-06 14:25:35 And when the war subsides in the ME,  war hardened merc return to the continent to either continue the mini wars on the continent or start new wars. The oil wealth in the Arab nations is a fuel for African wars. It's a wild circle
5896 2018-08-06 14:25:34 I propose, no insist that @cafreeland and @JustinTrudeau immediately stop allowing imported oil from Saudi Arabia #cdnpoli
5897 2018-08-06 14:25:27 I love Adam's but it's such a bitch to get the oil to go back into the sludge.
5898 2018-08-06 14:24:51 We should right the wrong our nation did to the Iranian people when we turned our back on the very pro-American Shah because oil barons thought it would get them access to Iran’s oil.
5899 2018-08-06 14:24:50 I agree with you on the demographics.  It’s the combo along with readily accessible and loosely controlled guns that makes a deadly situation.
5900 2018-08-06 14:24:46 just oil change and spark plugs for now!
5901 2018-08-06 14:24:37 Same. That’s one of the only reason I’m finishing out. Just in case I regret going into the oil field, I’ll have my teaching degree to fall back on.
5902 2018-08-06 14:24:37 The escalating war of words between Canada and Saudi Arabia suggests @JustinTrudeau has to authorize building the Canada East pipeline from Alberta so eastern provinces so we don't depend on Islamofasict Saudis for oil. #cdnpoli

5916 2018-08-06 14:23:27 Let them try...We only import 10% of our oil from Saudi. Great time to start up our refineries again. We can support our own demand. T's pissed that we are doing fine in spite of his tariffs.
5917 2018-08-06 14:23:23 Liberals will never advocate use of Canadian oil.Would anger all their friends.

5920 2018-08-06 14:23:19 To add to that...if the dilbit (not oil) was intended for domestic consumption, the pipeline would need not run past Ontario. Instead, we hear pipeline aficionados discuss getting to “tidewater,” the ocean. By the by, Facebook isn’t the best information source. Have a nice day.

The Standard Oil trust streamlined production and
5923 2018-08-06 14:23:10 But any given day you might be using Saudi oil + supporting their human rights denying gov + their private citizens that funnel millions into terrorism.

5924 2018-08-06 14:23:09 You do not need to be ignorant. Your town is asking for oil. We give it. I do not want to discuss with you. You are only four years old.
5925 2018-08-06 14:23:05 Not having any major cities helps, apparently :)

Never said gun ownership was the only criteria.  Add it to population density, lack of education, poverty... it’s a dangerous combination.

5960 2018-08-06 14:20:35 Canada can tell it's citizens that travel to Saudi is not allowed.  If you do, don't come back.  No re-entry.  Simple and effective.  We do not need to support this brutal dictatorship that denies almost all rights to half it's population - females. Its blood oil. No thanks.
5961 2018-08-06 14:20:34 If it were not for oil & Western strategic interests around it, KSA & GCC nations would be ostracized like Afghanistan (like under the rule of Taliban) & the butcher-thugs-autocrats like MBS ruling these nations would be considered as analogous to Taliban.

5964 2018-08-06 14:20:16 We should see treasury yields skyrocket now,as oil goes above100usd/barrel and onward toward 200 usd/barrel,then an invasion by USA into Venezuela,securing their oil reserves
5965 2018-08-06 14:20:15 Thanks for the great slides @whereistanya! Reminds me of an experience I had, not a technical role, but I was the "oil" (fill gaps, keep things running). Got dinged on my review and passed over for management position. So I fired them. ;-)

5978 2018-08-06 14:18:41 Correction on last. Oil was a 47 tick loss. so total is at 36 for the day. 3 ticks below target. but this is an average over the week...

5988 2018-08-06 14:18:12 I loved the reference to Molly's parents "networking" but the Jovan Musk killed me (and yes I used to buy it!  Now can't stand the smell of musk oil!)

5991 2018-08-06 14:18:07 are you for real? small earthquakes occur over most parts of the UK on a regular basis, Surrey should be any different! In fact Swansea close to me very recently had one, I felt it in Bristol. From my knowledge there is no oil/gas exploration going on there! #ukog #angs
5992 2018-08-06 14:18:06 America imposed sanctions in Venezuela yet they are still stealing it's oil, SA media is good at pointing hunger on other countries yet we are also failing with our Capitalism.
5993 2018-08-06 14:18:04 
5994 2018-08-06 14:18:01 Why do you think Venezuala is our peer?  This is nonsense.  Estonia?
Yes, Mexico should be included because it’s an OECD country.
But hey, the way we’re going, these lawless, authoritarian countries will probably be our peers in the future.
5995 2018-08-06 14:17:54 Canada is certainly entitled to pursue it's own foreign policy. However, I doubt the Saudis are taking this action based on having a very old good relationship with the US. Because of their oil they have good relations with China, Russia and India to make a few.
5996 2018-08-06 14:17:50 @segalink more oil to keep the fire on you burning , #Endsarz oluwa is involved. Go for us @segalink

6000 2018-08-06 14:17:34 Medical marijuana works! I know someone who had a dog with arthritis so bad that the dog could not even stand up. After using Emu 420 oil, the dog started back walking within 24 hours. I highly recommend trying it if you are in a state which has legalized it.
6001 2018-08-06 14:17:29 @SaudiEmbassyUSA KSA & GCC nations like UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, etc are still in "medevial" ages ruled by "thuggish Wahhabi autocrats" such as MBS. The common curse with all the GCC countries is Oil, Wahhabism & dark-age laws of Sharia.

6010 2018-08-06 14:16:04 Sixty Minutes had a great piece that said Italian olive oil is not what it is labeled to be. The industry has been hijacked by the mafia there and much of the product is a variety of oils adulterated and colored with chloroform. The American products are labeled accurately.
6011 2018-08-06 14:16:01 Did you know Spain is the largest exporter of olive oil to Israel? In 2016, Israelis consumed 21,000 tons of olive oil, of which 5,000 tons were imported.
6012 2018-08-06 14:16:00 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
6013 2018-08-06 14:15:55 You see Alda, you country may have the oil, but us Canadians know what to do with it.
6014 2018-08-06 14:15:53 I’d rather have my CBD oil though. 
6015 2018-08-06 14:15:40 Son so cool i decided to get my oil changed too and a couple little tings just so I have a reason to tip him more #TakeCareOfYourPeople

6018 2018-08-06 14:15:08 This is all nice, well and right but someone needs to have an impact on Iraq at the same time 'coz they buy tons of stuff including oil from Iran ..... the sanctions are undermined right in front of our eyes.......
6019 2018-08-06 14:15:06 The urge to bring efficascent oil is strong ahahaha

6024 2018-08-06 14:14:39 No, Hawaii is actually the worst example.  It is an isolated island chain with an economy predominantly based on tourism.  Due to the extraordinary housing costs, anyone disenfranchised quickly leave.  It is a notoriously bad comparator.

6030 2018-08-06 14:13:58 Canada is supporting Iranian terrorist yet wanna crucify the great nation of Saudi Arabia for defending Islamic values.
6031 2018-08-06 14:13:57 It is your unfounded opinion that it comes from God. 
And if you believe that "incapable of improving" is a positive... well that's going to lead to you having trouble to adapt when the oil free rent stop.

6038 2018-08-06 14:13:14 He is. But that's like the Saudis pumping more oil to make up for low prices. Devaluing means he's buying USD. Which means lower rates for the US (Trump likes that) & it will cause more dollars to come into the US, bidding up assets & even Trumps real estate
6039 2018-08-06 14:13:08 @ruthhayhurst how ironic that you’ve captured an ambulance on your main photo.... an essential service. What do you think is powering it? Oil! Deluded retard. I see you’re upping your game after fridays results! #nimby #ukog #angs #dor #solo #deluded #hypocrite

6041 2018-08-06 14:12:33 Tarik Ibn Ziyad, the Al Mohad and the Al Moravid were Amazigh, North Africans, "Berbers". 

The Arabs had Mohamed and Islam. And since 100 years or so they have UK/USA and Oil. In between they lived under a rock.

6049 2018-08-06 14:11:58 We hear this very often that #Pakistan hit largest reservoir of Gold, Coal, Gas, Aluminium etc but have never heard that Pakistan benefitted out of any of those reserves. Fingers crossed for this Oil reserve.

6051 2018-08-06 14:11:46 Snake Oil; they are sold on a product that works miracles, has little mess and interruption to there busy life, is guaranteed for years and all for a few ££££. It's the perfect storm the only way to stop it is to educate and highlight the failures that's not easy

6053 2018-08-06 14:11:39 I guess my only pt is that Iran was once #4 oil producer in the world.  Could be again.  But not this yr or next.  If political/economic issues were ever worked out in Iran/Libya/Ven, 4 mbd could be added in <5 yrs.  Another 2 mbd in the next 5 yrs.  Not likely though. #OOTT #oil

6057 2018-08-06 14:11:28 Even though Venezuela has more oil than any other country on Earth, due to 20 years of Socialism & an inflation rate of 1 million percent, a cup of coffee costs about the same as what a car cost 10 years ago

6059 2018-08-06 14:11:24 How can u steel when you stop putting money in & you keep it 4yourself, where did this money originally come from not out of the NIF but other taxation, perhaps a legacy from North Sea Oil
NIC fund was never & still is not a savings fund 4the future, it will be in the red by 2030
6060 2018-08-06 14:11:22 He’s got orange, deep red and purple down pat..... just a few more and we will have a full colour chart. You can tell his oil pressure is way up there. A brain aneurysm waiting to happen...... on national TV.... he always wanted high ratings!!!
6061 2018-08-06 14:11:22 Up yours Saudi Arabia. Time for Canada to ween itself off of all Saudi Oil. Canada has its own resources!
6062 2018-08-06 14:11:21 モヤモヤイライラが止まらん。いかんいかん。自分の機嫌は自分でとるもの！エロい夢に現実逃避だ！おやすみ！
6063 2018-08-06 14:11:14 It's about 11% of total volume. But anywhere east of Sarnia can be using Saudi oil (or any other tankered in foreign oil or US train oil) on any given day, so I called that half of Canada (It's about 55-60% of the population actually.)
6064 2018-08-06 14:11:12 You know it drops to about $16,900 if you exclude oil revenues. Which you should do really as it's a shared resource licensed out and financed by the UKGov.
6065 2018-08-06 14:11:12 I actually was agreeing with you. Jihadis do not have our best interest at heart. Sharia law is the exact opposite to our constitution. The two cannot mix it's like oil and water.
6066 2018-08-06 14:11:03 Summers secular stagnantion was in vogue back then w people debating 1% long run neutral rate and Yellen mused about 0% short run neutral rate. There were low expectations about the economy.

It was gradual steps the oil decline in 2015 fusion into a broad selloff in early 2016
6067 2018-08-06 14:11:03 Dior Blooming Bouquet for a floral scent, and organic Ambre Oil is my all time fav
6068 2018-08-06 14:11:01 It's delicious.  That redish thing is called Atchar. It's made by mixing raw and near ripe mangoes, spices and oil. It is South Africa's favourite "salad"
6069 2018-08-06 14:10:53 Marico not solvent extraction company.  It is doing fmcg.  They are processing crude oil to edible.  No solvent extraction
6070 2018-08-06 14:10:52 That’s a possibility. Iraq & Iran already have a deal for crude oil swaps in place. I think logistically it might be complicated bc how much more oil could Iraqi export infrastructure handle? 100k? 200k?
6071 2018-08-06 14:10:50 Ahmadinejad and Iranian politicians have been waffling on about trading in currencies other than USD for nearly two decades. See Iranian Oil Bourse. Nothing's ever happened. Pie in the sky IMO.
6072 2018-08-06 14:10:39 The main supplier exports their product.  Like we export illegal guns to Mexico, Latin and South America.

6084 2018-08-06 14:09:45 That is nonsense. Our connections with the M East go back to Roman times - Crusades - the age of Empire - 2WWs - oil - creation of Israel. Should have listened to TE Lawrence after WW1 & not listened to Jinner re Indian Partition. We reap what we sow.
6085 2018-08-06 14:09:42 THC oil is defooo a slow creeper because  wow

6090 2018-08-06 14:09:15 What has sewage got to do with oil contracts? As I said, the Irvine’s have no plans to spend billions on an upgrader. Regardless, there is no “we.” Oil companies make these decisions. It is less expensive for the Irvine’s to buy sweet light middle eastern crude so they do.
6091 2018-08-06 14:09:13 I was too lazy to make a sandwich for lunch this morning so instead I just put all the ingredients in my bag and i’m taking it all to work. avocado oil mayo and everything

6098 2018-08-06 14:08:38 Goals for this week (posting for accountability): Get TN license and plate, get oil changed, clean out house of things I don’t use/need/bring negativity, don’t spiral downwards and don’t bottle my emotions. Most importantly: don’t isolate myself, but don’t force it either.
6099 2018-08-06 14:08:38 Yesterday I got a butternut squash. I cubed it and browned it in a skillet with chipotle flakes. I added maple syrup and caramelized the squash. Then the squash cooked with a bit of olive oil until it was tender.
Tom loved it. Is that a good sign or a bad sign, @reluctantlyjoe?
6100 2018-08-06 14:08:35 Better than us, yes.
6101 2018-08-06 14:08:35 Cut off Saudi oil imports and move oil through energy east to eastern Canada! Oh wait, @JustinTrudeau killed energy east?!?!
6102 2018-08-06 14:08:30 Hej, här följer du aktuella oljepriset och dess utveckling #olja #oil
6103 2018-08-06 14:08:29 Oil exploration, even though we couldn't foresee all its horrible consequences was wrong from the start. The cartels took control even after just a few decades of inflated earnings and prevented the use of alternatives. Big Oil is still with us and destroying us.
6104 2018-08-06 14:08:22 Castor oil on your lashes before you go to bed!
6105 2018-08-06 14:08:11 Cost effective & good for the face. I recommend good pre-shave prep: hot water on the face, rub the hair with conditioner and rinse clean, the. oil the hair w shave oil, wait, & apply creme on top of that w a bristle brush. It’s a whole ordeal. I was 32 before I figured it out.
6106 2018-08-06 14:08:06 OLIP OIL !
6107 2018-08-06 14:08:00 Unfortunately they are blind to see the truth. they are deceived. How dare are they to compare Canada with all its economical power with ksa which is relying completely on oil
6108 2018-08-06 14:07:53 Good! So we can finally stop selling them weapons and buying their oil. I just can’t believe it was them who stopped this deal.
6109 2018-08-06 14:07:50 Butter or olive oil in a fry pan with minced garlic, salt, pepper, parm cheese, and a squeeze of lemon juice!
6110 2018-08-06 14:07:43 When you find yourself in an economic/political fight with SsudiyArabia you find yourself thinking “geez, I sure wish we had built efficient ways to move our own oil to our own markets”.
6111 2018-08-06 14:07:42 Another, Trudeau “grand standing” and the Canadian pay dearly for it. First the pipeline now the oil. What will it be next?
6112 2018-08-06 14:07:39 おかえりなさい！
6113 2018-08-06 14:07:38 おつかれ
6114 2018-08-06 14:07:29 Something like oil and water
6115 2018-08-06 14:07:25 That’s true of Chicago, but not most states with strong gun laws.
HI is the best example, because it’s an island so weapons can’t easily be driven over there.  
No barrier to driving guns to Chicago from other cities, and states with lax laws (many crime guns from out of state).

6118 2018-08-06 14:07:06 @JustinTrudeau want to make a real blow to KSA for expelling Canadian ambassador? Fast track Energy East and have ethical Canadian oil compete against Saudi blood oil.
6119 2018-08-06 14:07:00 I need my brows done and a pedi, and a oil change #rando
6120 2018-08-06 14:06:57 You should ask the devil for work or the American government. Have some dignity for the millions of people who lost their lives over your lies and greed. Not Russia not China not some  poor third war country but Americans demanding their dose of blood and oil
6121 2018-08-06 14:06:55 There must be TRILLIONS OF TONS of oil and minerals in Yemen.
6122 2018-08-06 14:06:52 Hey our spray contains vitamin e oil, coconut oil and conditioner. Those are the 3 essential ingredients we put
6123 2018-08-06 14:06:50 Rubbing alcohol or baby oil on a cotton ball and rub in circles.  Know from experience!  
6124 2018-08-06 14:06:41 Somebody bring me some anointing oil
6125 2018-08-06 14:06:24 帰宅
6126 2018-08-06 14:06:17 transmission oil?! 
6127 2018-08-06 14:06:03 i am not fit to gaze
into the clouds of a crystal ball.
into a pair of oil stained binoculars.
or a slight change of light at all
6128 2018-08-06 14:05:55 Yes it is an oil filter, but I quess you will not need to change it ever (not like on ice cars)
6129 2018-08-06 14:05:54 No, Chavez took on the debt based on the oil price on a socialist system. Which fails 100% of the time. He then chose a bus driver as his successor
6130 2018-08-06 14:05:40 And they fail to understand that everyone's business could buy oil elsewhere. Canada should hit them back, by giving a vendetta to the mutual trade partners.
6131 2018-08-06 14:05:37 雨、降って来たよ～。

あいつらには雨降って来る前に餌あげて来たよ。

6133 2018-08-06 14:05:20 I have come to terms with the fact I will never fill a #vape pen correctly...ever..I literally have no idea how any of this works and I'm just going to freebase vape oil on a tin lid by my stove because I'm dying for a cigarette..#MondayMotivation #mood
6134 2018-08-06 14:05:18 It was always rumored that Saudi Money flowed to these Oil Sands Protests (among others), You have anything on this?
6135 2018-08-06 14:05:15 why not refine the Oil in Canada and then sell it, instead of piping it out of Canada?
6136 2018-08-06 14:05:02 @JustinTrudeau time to stop importing Saudi Oil and promoting oil from Canada. #CanadaEast #keystone
6137 2018-08-06 14:04:48 VENEZUELA

THE MOST OIL RICH COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND HER PEOPLE ARE STARVING DUE TO 20 YEARS OF SOCIALISM, AND INFLATION IS UP TO 1 MILLION PER CENT 
VEN CURRENCY WORTH ZERO
MADURO LIVES IN LUXURY
6138 2018-08-06 14:04:47 If this represents anyone that actually believes things like this, I scroll down to where they keep all the oil .while on a quest for oil.
6139 2018-08-06 14:04:45 They will create a proxy out of dissatisfied Quebequois, flood them w oil money and within years Salafists will be on the rise.. wonder what the US will do, lol
6140 2018-08-06 14:04:31 Keynote to everyone, do not wake up and immediately drive. Even if your car needs to get an oil charge super badly, do not.
6141 2018-08-06 14:04:10 It also does not help that according to shell and chevron the oil sands are very labour intensive to extract compared to other areas they do business which is part of the problem with the oil sands which is big reason they left and put money in Permian basin in New Mexico
6142 2018-08-06 14:04:02 どれもこれもそれが原因で延々拗ねてるんだとしたら下らなすぎるし、謝る要素一個もないんでフォローしてやる気も起きないんだが。
6143 2018-08-06 14:03:54 It’s not even that hard lol I’m just mad my VW was shit because of the person before me. My alternator went last week, oil pressure was bad, axel broke this summer and it only had 84k on the dash.
6144 2018-08-06 14:03:34 Riiiight, Standard oil was just a benevolent company.
6145 2018-08-06 14:03:33 Love your oily mission girl! Also hope people know you cant just put any oil on a newborn! KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
6146 2018-08-06 14:03:32 It cost 21k to get an oil change for a Bugatti and takes 27 hours to do? Nah not even if I was a billionaire
6147 2018-08-06 14:03:30 My natural curly hair smelling like hibiscus flowers and coconut oil
6148 2018-08-06 14:03:17 "Libyans hate Gaddafi so we shall free them n take the oil" US.
"Iraqis hate Sadam so we shall invade them n take the oil" US. 
"Somalians hate Abdi ile so ......" Abiy Ahmed using the old US's expired claim.
6149 2018-08-06 14:03:16 The sooner we stop using oil the sooner we can ditch this dangerous fascist state.
6150 2018-08-06 14:03:11 Not that suspicious, cuz I bet this stuff isnt even pure olive oil, which is why its so cheap. When I lived in Syria I saw so many counterfeit products - from Adibas to knock-off McDonald's and KFCs, fake Rolex watches, even Bringles hahah! Syria is/was the China of the ME
6151 2018-08-06 14:03:10 Time for them to get into the modern times regarding human rights and the treatment of women. Morw countries need to put pressure on them and not kowtow to their oil... buy it from us :-)

6154 2018-08-06 14:02:33 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
6155 2018-08-06 14:02:23 I worked in IT and had to replace mainframe systems with applications that wouldn't work after 31.12.1999. Billions needed to be and WAS spent replacing or fixing systems that wouldn't work after the millennium. No doubt some snake oil peddlers cashed in like Brexiters.
6156 2018-08-06 14:02:12 #oott  wil wti / brent go sub -$10 on full iran oil sanctions ?
6157 2018-08-06 14:02:08 Why the fuck would anyone other than a stoner even make beard oil that smelled like patchouli?
6158 2018-08-06 14:02:05 Dye-Sublimation printing has many advantages when compared to Screen printing. 
It is much more eco-friendly because there isn't oil based fabric paint being washed down with gallons of water and the colours last longer, have more vibrancy there's a wider range of them!
6159 2018-08-06 14:02:02 皆さん、素晴らしい水着ですね！ｂ
6160 2018-08-06 14:02:01 This has never been just a conservative vs. liberal issue. It is always about plundering the treasury. That seems to be all that our public officials are good for any more.

6167 2018-08-06 14:01:30 I’m in my late 30s and people my age are shocked you can’t put oil down down the drain. I thought this was common knowledge growing up.
6168 2018-08-06 14:01:30 sevgili doğan, bu tür şeyleri dillendirmeyi sevmesem de eski fransızcam bildiğim öteki dillere kıyasla daha iyi.

6172 2018-08-06 14:01:16 I have oil and grease in places I didn’t know you could get oil and grease. 
6173 2018-08-06 14:01:10 What do you suggest using? I personally got stung by a honey bee on my arm, it hurt very bad and swelled! I couldn’t get anything to take the red, hurt, and swelling away! I googled what would help! Lavender oil and yes it worked!

6180 2018-08-06 14:00:34 Election time is a real thing.

Just spent 92 bucks on an oil change + car wash package. Insert rant about cost of services relative to salary increase in 3, 2, 1...
6181 2018-08-06 14:00:30 ฉันก็ประมาณ7ขวบ5555555555
6182 2018-08-06 14:00:28 That bit could easily be considered the same reasons why slavery should still exist. How about releasing nonviolent prisnors so they can live their lives. And fncking pay someone a living wage to wash and change the oil in your car!
6183 2018-08-06 14:00:20 A robust yet presentable garment which isn't made of oil, won't shed fibres into the sea, isn't sweated, and has useful sized pockets - is that too much to ask in these poor, shoddy, ruthless, sexist times?
6184 2018-08-06 14:00:18 Or in Paul/Alex case a grieving parent who they called liars?? Someone who wasted $100's on soy based placebo pills? No one is stopping the liars or snake oil salesmen speaking their crap or fleecing the gullible They just have to do it some place else.
6185 2018-08-06 14:00:09 I really don't like Jomtien Beach. The only good thing I found are the really cheap but nice massage parlours. Today I had the two best oil massages since my arrival. Now my body is prepared to return, I just have to convince my soul that going home is the right thing to do.
6186 2018-08-06 13:59:58 I played a Video on YouTube and Apparently Scientists already knew from the 1950's that Drilling for Oil made it more likely to Start Earthquakes but due to Corporate Greed the Demonic Elite and their Associates don't give a Damn as long as they can Laud it over us
6187 2018-08-06 13:59:56 なんか見てみたらPCだけみたい残念や(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)
6188 2018-08-06 13:59:54 So they can dick around in protected lands for more oil. It's pure selfishness.
6189 2018-08-06 13:59:44 I made friends with a white mom at the Honda Dealership while getting an oil change and we started talking about my cats and I opened up my phone to show her a picture and that’s how a 40 year old stranger saw my nudes.
6190 2018-08-06 13:59:24 There is still hope that the 500 Billion oil deal brokered by Tillerson can still be consummated. Many complicit GOP will be enriched by that. The traitors are still trying to get around sanctions.
6191 2018-08-06 13:59:18 結構大丈夫そうっすね
6192 2018-08-06 13:59:13 Ile ti afi ito mo, iri nio wo. Let million of them gather and use all anointing oil on him. Surely, he die.

6194 2018-08-06 13:59:07 If oil disappeared within 10-20 years. Britain would collapse. A few remember the forecourt fights that broke out just because Oil Tanker Drivers went on strike. Supermarkets shelves quickly emptied and people couldn't get to work, car, taxi or bus #pandemonium
6195 2018-08-06 13:58:51 Yo que cuidaba tanto mi campera naranja , ahora es más aceite ,nafta ,gas oil que campera

6197 2018-08-06 13:58:49 I swear how you talk to people is EVERYTHING! Just got a free oil change and getting my rotors AND brakes done for $70 instead of $200 
6198 2018-08-06 13:58:49 ㅠㅠㅠ 아프지마셔요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 
6199 2018-08-06 13:58:44 Shrimp made in olive oil and garlic cloves, seasoning of your choice + fresh lime juice. Jasmine rice made in chicken broth, rinsed black beans, cilantro, limes and add shrimp! Super quick and easy!
6200 2018-08-06 13:58:44 So you think, literally inventing the country to meet Western oil needs, is "planting seeds of liberty"? Sounds like the exact opposite, to me.
6201 2018-08-06 13:58:39 Fall in #Saudi summer #crude #oil electricity burn #prt from almost 1m b/d in 2015 to "only" about 400,000 b/d this year is likely to stem from rise in natural #gas output from 9.6n cu ft/d to about 11bn cu ft/day.
6202 2018-08-06 13:58:38 They had foreign exchange was the problem. They bombed us because of our oil embargo against them. 

But that's just me splitting hairs. It's fair to say it's almost completely impossible to achieve either ideal.

But socialism and fascism are NOT close ideally after populism
6203 2018-08-06 13:58:38 That's true for things like oil but we're trying to get past that... same people that don't understand trade = less war are fighting to keep oil in the main market.
6204 2018-08-06 13:58:33 Watch the price of oil....

It goes up rates go up...

6205 2018-08-06 13:58:32 Honestly there wouldn't be such a debate or backlash against global warming, if the countries governments would have come down hard on oil,coal&gas corporations rather than giving them subsidises to keep burning fossil fuel, & shifting the blame to Joe public.
6206 2018-08-06 13:58:25 PC？
6207 2018-08-06 13:58:23 Most of cycles are predictable by following economic trends. Economic  correction/recessions have always resulted in lower oil.

6232 2018-08-06 13:54:53 Because we don't have oil reserves they can tap into after an intervention

6244 2018-08-06 13:53:46 This dude is a sideshow snake oil salesman. Western Protestants evangelicals need to put down the pipe and pick up the bible and think about who wrote it in the first place!? 
6245 2018-08-06 13:53:38 You have effectively stopped tidal energy and reduced the installation of renewables hugely, compared with what should have been.  Why do you support nuclear to such a huge amount?  Why support the oil industry?
6246 2018-08-06 13:53:19 CBD oil; melatonin + valerian root; magnesium; lavender essential oil... just some suggestions.
6247 2018-08-06 13:53:19 I could be wrong @chhavi but most people i know need the oil to smell of coconuts. Thats how its considered to be real coconut oil

6253 2018-08-06 13:52:34 Waiting for my oil change this morning, reading a good book while listening to two idiots debating whether 9/11 happened in 1999 or 2000 
6254 2018-08-06 13:52:30 mayhaps we should cut off oil and gas exports to Quebec and BC in the dead of winter and then they will realize how important the oil and gas industry is lol
6255 2018-08-06 13:52:27 I've always loved the oil pipeline that runs right past the convention center and out through the East End

6257 2018-08-06 13:52:02 What can be done to make the bay bioluminiscent? Was told the gasoline & oil from the motor boats killed most marine life over decades.
6258 2018-08-06 13:51:53 #China deems its oil supply from #Iran as an existential requirement as it continues to increase import / consumption,Beijing is not going to heed #US warnings as Chinese officials are on the ground in Tehran negotiating huge oil reserve facility to be built in southern China.
6259 2018-08-06 13:51:41 Two questions for you
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
6260 2018-08-06 13:51:40 I can only imagine! At least it wasn’t the big Costco coconut oil! 
6261 2018-08-06 13:51:37 Last I looked ANJ were still clearing rainforest for oil palm in West Papua..... Have they stopped now?
6262 2018-08-06 13:51:34 Sad news, but a wonderful legacy. 
BTW, Yukon Golds are essential... then you don’t mind cutting down the butter a bit!
Our favorite variation:  replace some of the butter with a few tablespoons of truffle-infused extra virgin olive oil.

6264 2018-08-06 13:51:21 The majority of scientists do still believe in climate change, can I ask what would cause loss of lives? What would cause more death than the mass destruction of habitats, worker's being exposed to toxic fumes and the exploitation going on at many oil plants?

6266 2018-08-06 13:51:07 No Mark. It's not about austerity. It's about preserving our capacity to grow needed public services and not squandering the opportunity to use the benefits that a low Canadian dollar and low oil prices hadg on our economy. We have to put something away for the next rainy day.

6268 2018-08-06 13:50:51 We could keep all of Scotland’s oil in the ground and still be a wealthy healthy nation with exports galore and national resources to spare. Best national resources money can’t buy Scotland’s outward looking attitude and innovative courage.

6272 2018-08-06 13:50:19 Three decades! That's quite commendable. May the Lord fill you anew with His oil of gladness. Enjoy madam and this one more true MAN!
6273 2018-08-06 13:50:17 Unless the Irvine’s plan to build an upgrader in New Brunswick then, no there isn’t. Perhaps surprisingly the oil produced in NFLD doesn’t get refined in Canada either...it’s shipped to the states. You see, countries don’t make these decisions, companies do.
6274 2018-08-06 13:50:16 Mr. President, the price of oil has to fall for the strengthening of the US economy. Saudi Arabia is not reliable. You need to sit at the table with Iran. The people of Iran are expecting it. Then you will be a strong president.

I’m guessing: 
1) $25 oil

2) 2013, Snowden, w big help from I.C. Putin Republicans like Flynn gave away the NSA store

3) Rand Paul cleared the way.

6282 2018-08-06 13:49:40 At current consumption rates, without factoring in annual demand, we have 47 yrs of oil left, not 100s. Rare earth metals are called so because they actually are! How many tonnes are there according to you? Technology helps us exploit nature faster than we should, not create it..

I certainly wouldn't expect the totally complicit US to say anything negative.  To anyone.

Oh...and we don't need your oil.

they'll publish full production figures later Q3/4 with opex costs.

6370 2018-08-06 13:40:02 It would dump the entire oil sump out too and make the car stop, great way to save petrol because you would then walk.

6382 2018-08-06 13:38:47 A country that keeps borrowing is a servant to those nations lending her  

Debt imposes limiting obligation on the borrower as options for development are narrow.

Why not develop with oil money?

Oil money was consumed, not saved.

Save and invest, don’t borrow and spend.
6383 2018-08-06 13:38:42 Then why does Canada keep buying oil from them!!!!!

Apparently he use to apply black oil on his body and will be half naked while committing robbery.
6406 2018-08-06 13:36:32 Haah. Cleansing oil tu

6410 2018-08-06 13:35:45 Whoa,  we all know what that image may mean.  Threats of terrorism.  So let’s buy their oil.  Good plan.
6411 2018-08-06 13:35:43 Idea isn't unworkable. Possible, it would be the same as those massive oil pipeline lines.
Political will how ever
6412 2018-08-06 13:35:36 We should always praise those who stand up against governments and cultures that are genuine human rights abusers.  I am curious though if we will still import oil from such countries.  Actually, I do not need to wonder.

6417 2018-08-06 13:34:49 Saying the BP oil spill just “went away” and trying to use it to somehow explain away our current dysfunction is a really, really bad take, @JoeNBC #morningjoe

6419 2018-08-06 13:34:20 I have met many ordinary ppl like fruits seller on bicycle, oil changer, Kulfi wala ,plumber n shopkeeper n asked abt present stituation after ELECTIONS.

They are waiting for Nawaz to come under whom BUSINESS was flourishing
6420 2018-08-06 13:34:18 Has the oil price gone up or not?
Has oil been devolved,,NO so there nust still be money in it.
Are you seriously saying oil is worthless Liam?
You are telling oil rich people thier oil is worthless!
scota have heard that for 40 years
6421 2018-08-06 13:34:15 The building they bought was an old car shop and so it had a basement so they could do oil changes and such. Now they just use it as storage. But the entire store is huge and it's one of the least busy in the franchise 
6422 2018-08-06 13:34:05 Iyaaaa itu sayang! Tapi menurut aku lebih bersih pake milk atau oil sih
6423 2018-08-06 13:33:56 Kalo sensitif mending putih aja, sebenernya senka ga ngaruh banget buat oil, untuk yang oily katanya bagus, buat dry juga bagus karna ga bikin kering gituloh lembut lah/?

6426 2018-08-06 13:33:37 Yes, tapi lebih spesifik kan ya. Kalo leher keseluruhan bagian. 
Problem pengolesan oil, kl ngmg leher ntr semuanya diolesin.
6427 2018-08-06 13:33:15 Not necessarily, theres different types of textures that could be acheived with oil painting especially since there’s so many layers. If you’re blending and softening skills are good enough they can be hard to detect
6428 2018-08-06 13:33:11 Oh yummy  Momma has been brushing our hot peppers with olive oil and cooking them on the grill. They turn out really yummy

6442 2018-08-06 13:31:29 No he did not,,you are spouting what the media said again.
The EU have stated scots can stay in the seat left vacant by UK.
EU after all wants access to Europes largest oil and gas fields Liam,just as westminster has had access for 50 years to 92% of it
6443 2018-08-06 13:31:29 Ok ladies and gents I didnt think I needed to say this but if you come to get your oil changed pls be dressed in your car and not just completely naked.
6444 2018-08-06 13:31:26 Why don't you want to share the oil and gas?
6445 2018-08-06 13:31:25 :-) Dude The world of policy making is not a linear graph.When Oil decreased the end user price was kept same with more taxes.That helped in reducing Fisc & Inflation.When it increased the end usr price is always under review.If it goes beyond a point, taxes have to be reduced.
6446 2018-08-06 13:31:17 Ok the oil price is mid $70's / barrel and has gone to that level since the sanctions.
It doesn't explain the disproportionate refining costs relative to a few years ago. As I said we had 140/barrel and $1.70 at the bowser but now $70 crude 1.80 bowser. To me doesn't make sense.
6447 2018-08-06 13:31:10 Coffee + coconut oil + blender = magic bean juice
6448 2018-08-06 13:31:04 How the fuck are billion dollar investments being made into oil pipelines in 2018?? Complete abomination.
6449 2018-08-06 13:30:51 Is UK an oil producing country? These people don't know what they talk about, it's been 3 years, where are the refineries, modular or whatever? At least a cleaner can afford to buy petrol in UK, abi?
6450 2018-08-06 13:30:46 This bot is cool because you can pour coconut oil instead of having to scoop it out
6451 2018-08-06 13:30:43 LOL! You're missing the obvious. It's the oil companies that are the robbers. Even they admit to global warming. But we know longer have to discuss it as a theory, we can see it happening all around us. Or maybe you're not living on the same planet? #ClimateChange

With average of $50 per barrel of crude oil, analogue PMB has increased it to over $47B in 3yrs..What happened?

6455 2018-08-06 13:30:11 The AT&T monopoly for sure but also the Standard Oil monopoly back in the early 1900s. Which actually still contributes to your idea about connecting people in a way if the trains back then were running on oil

6457 2018-08-06 13:29:42 No you did`nt Liam but you can now
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas or the 8% we get just now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
You can answer both now Liam
6458 2018-08-06 13:29:38 I hate being an adult who has to pay for all her expensive oil changes
6459 2018-08-06 13:29:35 No they were ruined by kleptomaniac rulers who had all their eggs in the oil basket.  However all the socialist republics in Europe especially Norway, Finald & Sweden have higher quality of life and live longer than Americans...

6465 2018-08-06 13:29:01 Ugh. Garbage! What is the sense of adding MCT oil to maple syrup? (I know: make it sweet so idiots will buy it and put MCT in it to make them think it's "healthy" along with the "natural" sugar! YAYYY!!  I'm so healthy now!! )
6466 2018-08-06 13:28:53 IMHO it's the opposite; individualism is what gives you a higher GDP (unless oil etc) and more freedom. That's why I like it and love Europe. Lonliness creates an insane drive to innovate and excel.
6467 2018-08-06 13:28:51 He might have been promised to be given oil block and cover his corruption case
6468 2018-08-06 13:28:49 I don't know why we give this criminal the bandwidth he doesn't deserve. Mr Oil for food Wrangler with his boss Kofi. Man swings faster than a pendulum on speed.

6471 2018-08-06 13:28:22 Did scots have their EU vote ignored or not?
Did scots vote for WM to take 92% of our oil and gas then tell us we are skint?
Scots always outvoted at WM,is this your idea of democracy?
6472 2018-08-06 13:28:19 1. Aensible debate on fracking would reveal that it is bad option for the UK (different geology, much higher population density)
2. There is more than enough tax incentive for North Sea oil already, considering the Norway got bn£ from the same oil fields that cost UK 400 mio£

6481 2018-08-06 13:26:37 You wish you were as right or as righteous as the Pope because you're a fake Christian and nothing more than a snake oil salesman. Your support for Trump shows your extreme hypocrisy. You do have a few good traights. so should exploit them instead of judging others.
6482 2018-08-06 13:26:22 Say the dicks who cannot even extract their own oil without western knowledge and experts. Say the dicks whose rulers are puppets of the west planted there to guarantee oil supply and guarantee the security of Israel. Say the biggest traitors of the Muslim nation!

6490 2018-08-06 13:25:47 Well, 10% less oil imported from Saudi Arabia is better than importing any.

Also, who cares? The Wheat Board and all its assets are gone now. We have no, zero, zilch in the way or reasons to worry about our diplomatic status with this "Kingdom".
6491 2018-08-06 13:25:42 SNP prefer dirty, unprofitable oil to (relatively) clean, accessible, cheap and commercially needed shale gas. It shows the danger of being reliant on the green vote.

6520 2018-08-06 13:22:03 Conspiratorial News? I call it disingenuous garbage designed to suck in an audience that is open to suggestion so that he can hawk tactical perineal wipes and other snake oil.

6522 2018-08-06 13:21:48 The Scottish economy is also more integrated with the UK than the EU. In 2013, about 63% of Scottish exports (excluding oil and gas) went to the rest of the UK (pdf). Only about 17% went to the EU. The UK is arguably a healthier economy
6523 2018-08-06 13:21:35 If there's not enough oil, best to chop it instead so it's still cooked while covered in oil.

6525 2018-08-06 13:21:22 I feel like satin matte is the best because I have oily combo skin so it doesn’t dry out my skin where it’s more dry but I’m not an oil slick where I’m more oily. Lol it’s a happy medium

6529 2018-08-06 13:21:01 @JonathanHunt007 Yearly. world production of oil worldwide is 1.5 trillion gallons per year.  A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Compared to forest fires and volcanoes erupting, oil is a minor pollutant. There has been one degree of temperature rise since the year 1890...

20a: Oh, true!

Example b:
Me: Just did some work.

6561 2018-08-06 13:15:39 The issue, of course, is PRICING. The greatest examples of market manipulation can be found in the oil industry, and nothing is ever done about it.
6562 2018-08-06 13:15:37 Absolute claptrap. Oil majors have cost of recovering a barrel down to $12. Current oil price is $73

6597 2018-08-06 13:11:52 If we leave and go hands off in the Middle East, oil prices will spike and we will pay more because places like China buy their oil from those nations. If it costs them more to buy it, it'll cost us more as consumers in the end.

6657 2018-08-06 13:05:34 The EU companies are reluctant to accept the risks of secondary sanctions. 

Russia and China, however, have taken to purchasing Iranian crude oil in non-dollar contracts. Turkey has likewise openly rejected the US demands. I  not sure what India's current position is.

6659 2018-08-06 13:05:24 Norway doesn't follow that plan - how come?
Maybe because they have a state-owned stake in the industry?
Maybe because they call the shots with oil companies & make them pay.
Or maybe you have some loony-yoon explanation (that somehow ignores the shenanigans that go on in the UK)

6662 2018-08-06 13:05:18 So acc to your logic it should decrease when oil prices were at life time low ??

6665 2018-08-06 13:04:58 Government bond prices remained confined to thin band in absence of fresh triggers. Trade volumes remained lacklustre. Rise in crude oil prices today weakened risk appetite. Mood remained cautious before inflation data next week.

   and  used our oil,

  if they do not have Canadian money to spread Islam
   they are weak  then if every country do that
   they got no power.

Chinese oil company PetroChina hit $1 trillion in market cap in 2007. (It has since crashed and lost 80% of its valuation.) Privately held Aramco, the Saudi oil giant, valued at $2 trillion by investors, is not yet listed publicly.

6801 2018-08-06 12:49:52 People are out here making a gimmick of the oil.  Father, You never wasted one drop of the oil in the Bible.

6831 2018-08-06 12:47:16 Li reserves aren't the issue; it's their extraction. As with any mineral, efforts are needed to reduce water consumption and chemical leaks. Worth noting that Li-ion batteries can be recycled whilst oil, with its damaging extraction & refining process, can only be burnt once.

6847 2018-08-06 12:45:23 By normal does he mean invading other countries, murdering thousands of people for oil, supporting presidents or countries that care nothing about the human rights of their citizens, and meddling in other county's affairs? If you look at it, Iran is more normal than the US.
6848 2018-08-06 12:45:19 /rlt/ kalian yang kulit kering double cleansing pake apa aja?

6849 2018-08-06 12:45:09 I did it again. I put too much coconut oil on lastnight and now my I look like I haven't washed my hair in days.
6850 2018-08-06 12:45:01 So what you’re saying is that when I inevitably forget my hair oil, I have a backup plan.
6851 2018-08-06 12:45:01 I would also love to see this statement engage seriously with the long history of steel, oil, telecommunications etc.

Or just a hypothetical utility company.

6854 2018-08-06 12:44:48 Exactly why oil and gas is up; OPEC has banned oil in the Middle East and we are now the number 1 distributor/manufacturer of oil and gas....if we're paying more then imagine what everyone else is paying in other countries since we distribute an enormous portion of the oil

6865 2018-08-06 12:43:03 @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland it is far past time to build Energy East and stop Saudi oil from coming into Canada. NOW!!! This Saudi decision is no surprise.

6901 2018-08-06 12:39:00 Can’t speak to Shabwah but the Mukalla story was known locally. Compensation paid for loss of tax revenues from Mukalla & oil sales from Ash Shihr, blended in storage @ Fujairah. There were a few contacts on the Mahra/Hadramawt border as AQ fighters from Mukalla were turned back.
6902 2018-08-06 12:38:47 So they fought to keep Ulster in the union despite it having no oil yyyy
6903 2018-08-06 12:38:46 Silly Canada. When will you learn if the country has oil and is willing to trade there is no civil rights issue with their treatment of people.
6904 2018-08-06 12:38:41 Ooh, how about capitalist US supporting, funding and propping up the terrifying Saudi Arabian regime to guarantee a steady supply of oil so critical to Capital accumulation. This is too easy

6939 2018-08-06 12:34:21 Life hack: if you go somewhere and you tell them you’re a broke college kid, they might give you a discount. Aka I just got $10 off my oil change.
6940 2018-08-06 12:34:15 Really? World leading Renewable energy tech. Fantastic education system, World leader in IT tech. World leader in medical research, vast fishing grounds, oil, Agriculture/farming, tourism...
6941 2018-08-06 12:34:14 I don’t apply anything anymore. No day/nightcream, oil or foundation. Within seconds after applying the sweating starts and I can start taking it all of again. Waste of time and money.
6942 2018-08-06 12:34:14 I lost two full dye days!!! I thought I was dying!!! Now I have to burn the midnight oil dying for the weekend 
6943 2018-08-06 12:34:08 Just ate a falafel wrap, complete with oozing harissa, pickled purple cabbage and oil, while wearing a white dress, and didn’t spill ANY. Please clap. #soproud #FinallyAnAdult 
6944 2018-08-06 12:34:06 Presumably doesn't understand economics. All large oil producers are , in effect, Dollar dependent as this is how their most precious asset is priced. Whats Spanish for ignorant doughnut?
6945 2018-08-06 12:33:56 I like to add a few drops of myrrh oil, jojoba oil, Vit E oil, camelia oil, tea tree...
6946 2018-08-06 12:33:48 But they have oil so "we" close our eyes and let thing slide...
6947 2018-08-06 12:33:42 チャーハンとか唐揚げの下味にしたりもできる万能たれですよね！！

6949 2018-08-06 12:33:31 Well yeah. Bugatti Veyrons run a couple million bucks. The oil change is $21,000. Can't do that AND pay that living wage for clothes.
6950 2018-08-06 12:33:22 Shiny black skyscrapers slipped past one by one, until they suddenly gave way to a field of pipes running west. In the distance the monstrous oil rigs pounded a staccato rhythm, undulating black shapes against the red-orange sky  #MuseMon
6951 2018-08-06 12:33:19 I survived another day, Orac's post about Dr Funk. I think Organic Butter
+clean meat is probably ok. Organic Live Food has a good post about
Oils+Fats--Grapeseed Oil (hexane free) the best. 
NO MENTION OF FUNGUS OR AB HX?  I think Genetics is way overplayed.
OH+AB=Fungal MY.

6955 2018-08-06 12:32:58 Will Saudi cut off oil supplies to eastern Canada? Wouldn't that be ironic!
6956 2018-08-06 12:32:48 Add the cod to the pan and cover with the lid until the fish has cooked. Pan fry the samphire in a little olive oil - serve with a dollop of yoghurt and harissa paste.

6960 2018-08-06 12:32:26 What of Abba Moro that killed many Nigerians and still scammed for jobs?  What of @diezanimadueke the oil goddess and the grand witch of corruption? Not all of us have amnesia like u people.

6971 2018-08-06 12:31:01 Yes, as our population increases we need wiser management of water sources. An idea I have pondered with since 1987. We can build gas and oil pipelines from coast to coast. If we can remove salt from ocean water to make it useable. A huge water pipeline thru those desserts.
6972 2018-08-06 12:30:58 คงไม่ vipใช่ไหมถ้าวิ่งนี้ตายอีกรอบเลยนะ
6973 2018-08-06 12:30:56 Okay, bear with me. Take a 6” long potato. Peel it. Dig out a U-shaped channel lengthwise so it’s about 1/2” thick all the way around with an opening at the top of about 1”.  Soak in cold water, blanch, then deep fry in oil and season with salt. 

Bam. French fry hot dog bun.

6981 2018-08-06 12:29:45 It’s difficult to say which man made a worse deal Trump & Cruz are like oil n water...the two are miserable together. Match made in hell...so, devil is a good term to describe both
6982 2018-08-06 12:29:41 It’s the Moroccan Oil ones 
6983 2018-08-06 12:29:37 We have the third largest oil reserves in the world, the 4th largest producer. Saudi imports of oil comprise 9% of Canada's imports. This will not effect private business between corporations. IMO, this will have very little impact on Canada as a whole.
6984 2018-08-06 12:29:06 It was so smart of Trudeau to approve Energy East - to enable Canada to have the future ability to take a stand on a unethical oil producing country.  

Oops.
6985 2018-08-06 12:28:44 pake cleansing oil apa kamu?
6986 2018-08-06 12:28:33 . That means farmaajo's adminestration were  failed for the policial changes going on the #HORN 
. And #mp apiye ahmed end the war for #Eretria to concentrate all of his forces for somali region that was recentally got a oil.
6987 2018-08-06 12:28:32 The Saudi’s are no friend to Canada. 

They don’t just export oil - they also export terrorism.
6988 2018-08-06 12:28:29 These oil reserve were found in mid 60's but abandoned due to some political reasons.
6989 2018-08-06 12:28:23 Put oil
6990 2018-08-06 12:28:05 1. Det var tveklöst inte tillräckligt. 2. Någon som suttit i styrelsen för Lundin Oil bör kanske inte peka klimatfinger på andra.
6991 2018-08-06 12:28:00 This is fantastic news. I can't wait to see the empirical evidence Rhode Island will offer up to prove that 1. Man mad climate change is real and 2. Big Oil is culpable. What a waste of taxpayer money. Dopes live in RI.
6992 2018-08-06 12:27:43 Why did I think it was a good idea to schedule my oil change right after a third shift? 
6993 2018-08-06 12:27:43 스모어 이제 안 팔려서 슬픈 늅늅ㅠㅠ
6994 2018-08-06 12:27:35 Hey S Ray how is your system of thinking working un Venezuela. Complete economic collapse from a country with more oil than Suadi Arabia and more Natural Resources that goes beyond belief yet they have become a 3rd world country due to Socialism where Government runs everything.
6995 2018-08-06 12:27:29 Intel downgrade, trade war and crude oil.

6997 2018-08-06 12:26:55 There's this one that people have been wearing for the last two or three years that they call, variably, "Egyptian Musk," or "Muslim oil," or another one. I don't know what it is, but it gives me a fucking headache for HOURS.
6998 2018-08-06 12:26:55 Unsustainable socialist policies, nationalization of private assets, dictator who destroyed democracy. Basically everything the EFF want. Nice to see the ANC wish this particular dictator well after a assassination attempt. Huge oil reserves and potential wasted.
6999 2018-08-06 12:26:53 You've got that wrong. He wasn't conned...he allowed this. Russia is making money by "violating" rules & sneaking them oil & coal. #45* made this possible by pulling out of "war games", ergo no troops to see or stop it. This was ALL PLANNED between him, Putin & Kim. #Gaslighting

7011 2018-08-06 12:25:35 RT veganIife: If you peel sweet potatoes, slice them to French-fry width, coat them with olive oil and bake at 350-400° until crispy, then dust on some salt, pepper, and chili powder, you'll have something pretty darn healthy that still tastes like a fast food indulgence.

7015 2018-08-06 12:25:00 I tried this method and it didn't work well. I think there was just too much oil and it had soaked in too deep. Got another suggestion to try today, but will likely simply have to reupholster the chair. Thank you, though!
7016 2018-08-06 12:24:50 The roll is good, but the wrap needs work... a little sesame oil to help seal it?

7018 2018-08-06 12:24:41 Alright everyone, I have created my own 3 ring circus today by scheduling an oil change at a terrible time. IF I finally stream today, and I really want to, it's going to be much later than my scheduled start. May N'Zoth have mercy on my calendar and soul.
7019 2018-08-06 12:24:40 Saudi Arabia only exports two things. Oil, which you can get from lots of other countries and terroism, which I am sure you can cope without.

7021 2018-08-06 12:24:14 He cancelled energy east. A pipeline would have provided jobs and a safer way to get Canadian oil to refineries. Quebec does not want jobs they want subsidies
7022 2018-08-06 12:23:56 I’m getting an oil change and there was this older gentleman before me. The mechanic comes up to me and I tell him the man was before me. The mechanic looks at the old man who tells him what he’s getting done and the mechanic looks irritated.
7023 2018-08-06 12:23:54 Would be great they have refinery’s in the east but think its safer to let tankers travel the st Lawrence so east coast has oil tankers coming into every day from the governments kick back country’s
7024 2018-08-06 12:23:52 This is terrible news. Will the website still accept orders for snake oil?

7026 2018-08-06 12:23:41 He pours a little essential oil on his hands before rubbing them "Okay, I'll start with your lower back" placing his hands on Akashi's back, he slips down on his skin. He began to massage his lower back, leaning towards him time to time to kiss his neck and shoulders.
7027 2018-08-06 12:23:38 It is nice to know that I won't freeze to death and my pipes won't explode if the power goes out. And fans and a/c don't run on oil.

7031 2018-08-06 12:22:50 We have lots of oil, but I wonder if this could be a ploy for our govt to get the pipeline they want built! 
7032 2018-08-06 12:22:43 As best of my knowledge @exxonmobil doesn't have shares in any onshore activities in #Pakistan. News of large oil reserve found in Baluchistan in @dawn_com, which is now picked up by others including @arabnews, @ProPakistaniPK, etc is most likely a #FakeNews

7034 2018-08-06 12:22:35 No, Norway is a largely capitalist country with high degrees of economic and business freedoms and solid property rights. It also has high taxes and a large public sector. But that's possible because Norwegian capitalism is doing reasonably well (and they have a lot of oil...).

7038 2018-08-06 12:21:31 He should've curbed the power of the militia (leaders) when he had the chance; when he was popular, after Mosul & Kirkuk. Because w/ those around he can't eliminate the root cause, which is corruption, not oil prices or decentralization. He is weak. It's too late, he can't fix it

7048 2018-08-06 12:20:03 THAT WOULD BE MY POINT. I flat out said finite natural resources. There is a limited supply of them, therefore, it is zero sum. Gas and oil, no. Things like cobalt, uranium, lithium, etc, would be zero sum...

7056 2018-08-06 12:18:43 รอทุกอย่างค่ะ ดีใจหมด
7057 2018-08-06 12:18:25 Slightly misleading - the fund divested from all companies involved in NW, not singling out US. It also divests from tobacco companies, coal and companies causing "environmental damage". Ironic since the fund itself is surplus of Norway's oil revenues! 
7058 2018-08-06 12:18:12 God's biggest regret is putting all that oil underneath Islamic nations instead of Israel.

7062 2018-08-06 12:17:49 It’s true, EnergyEast would help us refine our own oil. However BCs refinery is constantly working at capacity. Advocating BCs politicians to stop pipeline obstruction of TMX won’t help us refine more oil for ourselves.

7066 2018-08-06 12:16:38 The construction of the 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day by Dangote refinery is expected to help Nigeria save over $7.5B through import substitution. This is hilarious! Why is it so difficult for government to achieve this feat all this years???

7218 2018-08-06 11:53:11 2 guys playing card. One says the other is winning because he's not serious. The other says "add am oil (money) make e serious na". They start with very little money, get used to it, lose/win and increase the stake gradually.

That's how a lot of people became chronic gamblers.

7224 2018-08-06 11:52:49 Canada has this stupid idea that somehow this will help them. Saudi Arabia will move at their own pace for human rights. Women are slowly moving to be liberated.  Canada gets 20% of its oil from Saudi Arabia.

7232 2018-08-06 11:51:25 Thank you, Ms Freeland, for showing that oil money to spend on Canadian exports can't buy Canadian silence on human rights abuses. 

That was a classy move, following the best tradition of Lester Pearson, Flora MacDonald, Joe Clark, and Lloyd Axworthy.

7237 2018-08-06 11:51:03 Dude I work in your shitty oil, it is right that you have oil and big reserve of it. BUT IT IS USELESS, it is all oilsand needs huge extraction process which costs more than importing from others.I encourage you to read more about your shitty oil sands

7243 2018-08-06 11:50:19 This is very childish! Yessers point out the UK government should have had an oil fund but someone comes along & says it’s not really any good because a country that has one does things people don’t like? Are you incapable of deciding to not do the things you don’t agree with?

and this powder is holding my oil pretty well woah
7245 2018-08-06 11:50:09 Looks like Big Oil wants to extract the gas reserves there but the PM is not playing by their rules.
Hence the sudden awareness of human rights among students and then the gassing, internet blackout, hospital shutdown, etc etc., all the classic signs of an opressive dictator.

7247 2018-08-06 11:49:54 If only someone had come up with a national programme to ensure Canadian oil consumers got their supplies from oil produced in Canada. 

I bet Albertans would praise that sort of energy programme for ever.

7253 2018-08-06 11:48:59 Day 1 of healthy eating realisation: olive oil does not like being next to an ice pack...
7254 2018-08-06 11:48:42 Buckle up for oil turmoil and supply rationing.Oil is going to 200 usd /barrel oil.

This is about big oil, isn't it?
7259 2018-08-06 11:47:53 Then he said to me, “This [continuous supply of oil] is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel [prince of Judah], saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit [of whom the oil is a symbol],’ says the Lord of hosts. — Zechariah 4:6 AMP

7261 2018-08-06 11:47:27 Yes.  If only the pipeline could have been approved & built in a few months. 

And, if only the refineries out east were designed to handle all of what EE would have carried.

And, if only there wasn’t an ocean nearby over which oil could be transported from many other places.
7262 2018-08-06 11:47:25 Canada should just freeze all trade ties with anyone that continues to trade with saudi arabia. They are, after all, oil competitors.

Fuel oil neden önemliydi; o tarihlerde doğalgaz falan yok, fuel oil kalorifer yakıtı. İşte o nedenle elektrikli ısıtıcılarla bir kaç kışı titreyerek geçirdik.
7281 2018-08-06 11:45:04 Comments made out of lack of knowledge.
Personnally, I rsther lose 1.5 billion in trades then be complicit with a regime as archaic as Saudi Arabia... without the oil, they would be one of the poorest Country in the World.

7286 2018-08-06 11:43:55 70's inflation, although largely caused by the oil price rise, was exacerbated by the imposition of EU tariffs on imported food. The EU made things worse, not better.

7292 2018-08-06 11:43:08 Typically we service gens every 250 hours, even though manufacturers like Cummins specify every 500 hours.

We do this because the engine oil we use is especially useless. It lasts 100 to 150 hours.

That is why Gens die.

7320 2018-08-06 11:39:48 When my scalp was super dry, and had a lot of dandruff Castor oil worked really good. Not the Jamaican black Castor oil but the pure Aura Cacia one from like a health food store. I would apply it once/ twice a week and within a month I was good.

7344 2018-08-06 11:34:06 You broke away and became colonizers yourself. You also invaded countries with oil. Not to forget the slaves you had build your country.

7371 2018-08-06 11:29:30 Ive no real idea but I doubt it. When buncefield went up it didn’t exactly leave a smoking crater behind. The oil refinery might worry more about nuclear weapons being nearby!
7372 2018-08-06 11:29:28 Yeah, in the end it's just symbolic (EU move). But if they manage to get their Central banks to directly do the transfers with Iran - that will make a big difference at least for oil/gas. But unlikely. For now, it's China which can make or break Iran.

7496 2018-08-06 11:10:03 Brockham Oil Watch said:

“This is yet another example of a “gold standard” regulatory regime allowing operators to self-monitor & mark their own homework. There is no central database, the regulators hold data in disconnected systems that don’t allow for easy cross-referencing.”

Remember they were the richest country in South America from 1950 up to the 1980s before the oil price booms. 

How does it go from the richest to one of the poorests, it cannot just be oil prices.

It's so glaringly obvious.

7626 2018-08-06 10:47:17 Teaming up with Mercola is the death-blow to credibility, I feel even more justified now to dismiss the whole salt-sugar hypothesis. It's a pity that today's snake oil salesmen are so adept at mixing their hyperbole with actual truths.

7642 2018-08-06 10:45:25 Great thread. Regarding the USD rise to breaking the system—I agree but I believe in a different manner. I think what is already happening is 2 separate systems—one gold/oil based one usd based. The higher the usd rises in terms of commods/gold, the less it will be desired.
7643 2018-08-06 10:45:07 There's a difference between being proud of where you came from and being arrogant and looking down on others, just because your country got oil.

7662 2018-08-06 10:41:52 Hence I said enlighten me this after I long averred to that all countries now have a hybrid version. You do realize Venezuela adopted social welfare policies after a swing in oil prices in the 80s. Yet people now colloquially refer to it as a socialist state.

7730 2018-08-06 10:26:58 Shale oil is almost always derived from sea beaches in US. No shale oil/gas extracted from land. Sea water is used in the technology and no fresh water is used. The environmental impact is substantial but the beaches used are remote which are unused by humans.

7744 2018-08-06 10:25:07 Oh the EU is now blocking Trumps sanctions against Iran, because it gets most of its oil from Iran. Oh the EU is pretty good at fucking up any trade deal isnt it. Now the bureaucrats in Brussels want a trade war with the US because he holds his fork in the wrong hand.

7872 2018-08-06 10:03:33 Hi @Woozmeister, yes our flatbreads are safe to eat straight from the packet however we highly recommend that you heat them in a dry pan if you can (or in an oven or microwave for a minute or two). This is to release the olive oil in the bread and make the taste much more lovely!

3. Stability is wonderful ( maybe our mill could learn to stop playing games to aid pol stability)

7897 2018-08-06 09:58:55 What resource? No oil. No gold. No minerals.
7898 2018-08-06 09:58:34 And oil prices will rise to $250 a barrel. I suggest you stick to drillbits, pipe dope and chiksan connections  @Rigzone @El_Spy
7899 2018-08-06 09:58:18 My class in 4th grade apparently

7923 2018-08-06 09:52:52 This is shown by how the oil price crash hurt the Dubai eceonomy even though only 6% of its economy is directly related oil nowadays. Look at all the defaulters from 2014-17, foreclosures, bounded cheques, unemployment rise, downsizing of assets like Emirates Airlines
7924 2018-08-06 09:52:29 Starvation doesn’t happen in coalition controlled areas. Houthis also lobbed 100+ rockets at Saudi including the capital and Mecca, and oil tankers. Now tell me, if this was happening to any other country in the world, how would they response? would they tolerate it?

They carry on regardless, despite extreme weather events making this folly perfectly clear.

8097 2018-08-06 09:22:41 Yeah, even less water and cutting down trees is the best way to make sure the next wildfire is even bigger and once the whole place is a desert, there are no more wildfires and you can drill for oil in the sand. Genius Trump!

8105 2018-08-06 09:21:04 6. As regard fuel supplies, it might be useful to explore the availability of specialist chemicals used in oil refining, many of which are imported from the EU. If the dedicated tanker fleet is tied up, we could experience significant shortages of refined fuels.

8121 2018-08-06 09:18:12 So oil companies can spend millions secretively disparaging climate change or tobacco companies can lobby to conceal research on tobacco and you think that’s okay. It’s a view usually held by people with investments in oil and tobacco. Intellectually bankrupt.

8277 2018-08-06 08:53:29 ちげーよ笑
8278 2018-08-06 08:53:19 Simple, because the price of oil jumped up.
8279 2018-08-06 08:53:19 Yip. We have a multitude of natural resources that can help drive a prosperous Scotland - but as oil has shown,  does not use them for our benefit. That won’t change in the present or  future - so something must - and the answer is pretty obvious.

8302 2018-08-06 08:49:23 Appealing to individual consumers’ good will to make a more expensive and inconvenient choice every day in great enough numbers to affect climate change is futile. Eg. veganism is marginal; oil and gas investments have hiked; and coal demand is up – despite media headlines.

Why not US invest in a resource like cobalt, help our economy and prepare us for switching to electric cars, because it HAS to happen!
8475 2018-08-06 08:13:38 Venezuela's shortages started before the global oil price correction. But "dependence" on trade is really the best defence you have? All humans depend on trade! How long and how much would it cost you to make a chicken sandwich from scratch on your own?

8481 2018-08-06 08:13:09 Better yet, stop buying their oil. Which Canada probably doesn't anyway as it's got plenty of its own.

8597 2018-08-06 07:58:29 This heatwave should be a wake up call for all of us as we all as an individuals have an impact on the climate change. Using non renewables ( oil , coal and natural gas ) to produce energy every day all over the world is killing this planet!#thecube
8598 2018-08-06 07:58:06 It has been a few years since I read an article containing that information, so it may as you say. But that article showed that the US too very little oil from KSA, just more than we exported elsewhere. (that export must have been oil products, not crude)
8599 2018-08-06 07:57:52 Would those be the idiots who don't understand that Venezuela has been under economic siege by the US for years, that it's economy is inextricably linked to oil price, and that it has debt in a currency it doesn't control, because they seem uniquely to the right ?

8602 2018-08-06 07:57:19 That sounds like a lot of b12, i had to lower my dose cause it was making me dizzy. But too much b12 can cause liver damage.  2 other good vitamins for females to take are fish oil & folic acid.
8603 2018-08-06 07:57:14 I'm very happy that your husband survived. The oil may have absolutely nothing to do with it. He probably also ate cheeseburgers and took medications. Who knows? That's not really clinical proof.
8604 2018-08-06 07:57:04 Back from holiday & getting stuck in with great nutrition immediately...

8611 2018-08-06 07:55:40 @scentsbybookie can I put perfume oil in my hair? Very strange question I know 
8612 2018-08-06 07:55:32 Nigeria can`t move forward with this very structure in place. 
Sir, why didn`t you create industries in NEPZA. Under your tenure in Cross River State with all the oil wells in your hands, nothing substantial took place in that state.
8613 2018-08-06 07:55:30 The region from Surrey to North Wales had a big quake in 1939. This is just locals trying to stop the area becoming an oil producer. The are happy to see other parts of the country industrialised but not their own backyards.
8614 2018-08-06 07:55:26 Doesn't matter to me the KSA has been interfering in Canada for decades bribing officials keeping Alberta oil out of the east. So anything that convinces eastern Canada to dump Saudi Oil is fine by me. I could careless about the KSA it's personal.

8617 2018-08-06 07:54:58 Germany's still buying Putin gas. 

I wanna know who the eff is buying Venezuela's oil; boycott those bastards. It's almost as bad as Hillary's Haiti.
8618 2018-08-06 07:54:28 It’s fucking sad that when we stop buying Oil from Saudi Arabia it will be their choice, not ours........
8619 2018-08-06 07:54:26 what’s rosehip oil?
8620 2018-08-06 07:53:55 We as #Saudis are so attached to 2 things:
1. Oil
2. Titles
3. Everything else
8621 2018-08-06 07:53:27 院試っていつまで続くんですか？？？
8622 2018-08-06 07:52:32 Cept the CIA has Pakistans militical elite by the balls.. and vice versa .. some sort of deathly close-dancing .. so good luck with controlling that oil by yo'selves.
8623 2018-08-06 07:52:27 “Indy” Wales? Yeah lots of coal there I guess.  Reunited Ireland? War without end - good luck with that  “Indy” Scotland? Oil only <ahem> “asset”. Addicted to welfare  Seriously - you are utterly delusional. You and the rest of you Mel Gibsons need mental help
8624 2018-08-06 07:52:21 Preachers are feeding members and members are feeding preachers. The alabaster woman poured an expensive oil on Jesus, did He refuse it? No , he didnt. Preachers, true men of God are doing more if we look deeply.
8625 2018-08-06 07:52:05 Yes. He has companies like oil corps. Everything seems normal but it’s not. So we have to act normal and condemn these corps
8626 2018-08-06 07:51:40 With your #USD view and your #OIL view, a long in #USDCAD should be good :)
8627 2018-08-06 07:51:28 Nope but they are the biggest export and we aren't the only strong economy anymore. Sadly we rely on their oil. We need another energy source badly on many levels.
8628 2018-08-06 07:51:24 First time seeing a typewriter in action and the smell of oil and ink is bad

8633 2018-08-06 07:50:37 まだ終わってないw
8634 2018-08-06 07:50:28 Eastern Canada is finding out getting oil from sand land is problematic.  Most of your oil comes from us,  sand land, yourselves and Venezuela.  
Should the Saudi Oil go by by the amount of wealth left in Canada would be huge. Now is as good of time as any to punt them.
8635 2018-08-06 07:50:06 Literally so excited for payday so I can: fill my tank that’s on E, get an oil change that’s 3,000 miles past due, get new windshield wipers, and if I’m lucky, pay a bill or two. #livingmybestlife

8639 2018-08-06 07:49:24 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
8640 2018-08-06 07:49:00 There's directional drilling tech which, within limits, might allow someone to siphon off the oil from across the border to an extent. Depends on topo- and stratigraphy, continuity etc.

8642 2018-08-06 07:48:52 Hadi's government WAS contested following austerity measures and oil price increases in 2013-2014. This is what caused the September 21st revolution. Stop being a dog for an illegitimate "president", stop whitewashing occupation and accept the facts.

8649 2018-08-06 07:47:40 Briliant response to that complete drivel by Andrew Bolt. These "terrible" migrants have changed our lives for the better. Bolt argues we should still have to buy olive oil from a pharnacy & that alfreco dining with a health hazard. Crap.
8650 2018-08-06 07:47:37 This, from the man who walked away from the Paris agreement on climate change, who appoints oil executives & climate change deniers to run EPA! Fuck off, Donald! Clearly you know as much about the environment as you do about whether collusion & treason are legal or not!
8651 2018-08-06 07:47:27 Russias economy is dependent on oil/gas sales. Approved the sale of LNG to Poland.Aggressively pursuing oil/has sales to European nations to end dependence on Russian oil. Vigorously opposing Nord Storm 2 pipeline w/Germany which will generate billions/yr in Russian oil revenue
8652 2018-08-06 07:47:27 isn't there a dispute over this drilling activity with Iran? im pretty sure they'll have some reservations over an "american" company drilling for oil on their border.

8658 2018-08-06 07:46:43 Nice chart Madam Tayo. You are blessed but please how much was oil then PDP took over power in 1999? Was the PDP blaming anyone or set out to work to ameliorate living conditions of the masses? 

Oil price is low, yet your president spends over 180 days abroad spending billions.
8659 2018-08-06 07:46:39 I just need someone to massage wild growth oil in my hair before I go to bed.

8661 2018-08-06 07:46:35 Ok eastern canada. Maybe you should rethink your need for Saudi Oil.
8662 2018-08-06 07:46:35 you what, that makes sense, as I been saying my a.i. is great. msn offered. but on linkedin I guess everyone would be recommended Saudi prince upon joining. when I seen photo of east/west/Jap looked unhappy with abe. on/vac, we saving venazequla cuidad bolivier? only seaport, oil
8663 2018-08-06 07:45:55 I think a lot of countries are pledging to get rid of certain plastics by x year kind of like what they're doing with renewables as well.

Plastic is literally made from oil and when it breaks down it produces greenhouse gases. It's thought that plastics are a big factor in
8664 2018-08-06 07:45:35 Heard olive oil was good for dry hair, which is great but it's also really hard to rinse out. Several shampoos later I'm over here smelling like a salad.
8665 2018-08-06 07:45:33 Hey guys if you don't use coconut oil on the daily you should rly try it.
8666 2018-08-06 07:45:32 You two guys are making me wonder where does all the world's oil go to which countries. I know all the gas here comes from Alaska. And Europe is the one who's getting all that Sharia oil from Iran.

I'll just ignore that the bite is on the inside of my lip, rofl! 

I still need lip balm anyway! I've been using coconut oil lately. By itself it's only so so.

8680 2018-08-06 07:42:31 With Canada and Saudi Arabia in the news, did you know that the former actually has greater oil reserves than the latter when you factor in tar sand? Which it's now economically viable to extract.

Indeed.

You might not care to know.

8696 2018-08-06 07:39:28 yea followings good:  
- plastic production by 80% world wide.
-oil drilling should be reduced for other  source of energy as well i feel would be good for environment 
- 50-60 % reduction in cold drinks as well perhaps many natural lakes are drying
8697 2018-08-06 07:39:24 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8698 2018-08-06 07:38:54 I think it is something worse! I think that this is the perverse reaction by bored, poorly paid, over worked HO functionaries who are unaccountable. We are all born with an oil can in one hand, and a big spanner in the other, and guess what?

8702 2018-08-06 07:38:01 I wish that were the case but, their economy would be perfectly fine as they have the most oil.
8703 2018-08-06 07:38:00 The FIRS has demanded evidence that General Electric International Operations Nigeria Ltd remitted the excessive tax it withheld from Arco Group Plc, a Nigerian oil servicing company, for nine years. The sums in contention are €56,577.61, $2,923,642.36  and N360,482,041.19.

8785 2018-08-06 07:22:20 One has to wonder if Saudi Arabia's treatment of Canada has anything to do with Trump's attitude toward Canada, Trump's investments in Saudi Arabia, Trump's back channel promises to Saudi Arabia, and his support for their state owned oil industry.
8786 2018-08-06 07:22:09 So the oil price made people loss there jobs or what are you saying ???
8787 2018-08-06 07:22:07 Well not quite true as Chevron are very much involved in Venezuela. But yes they miscalculated the effect of Nationalization and that is why they are busy trying to change economic policy (oil) which they say has failed, if they don't there will be no Venezuela come December.

8872 2018-08-06 07:07:26 Do not worry. When the oil market tightens there will be plenty of buyers for US oil.
8873 2018-08-06 07:07:24 Tip the balance & those people won't be able to afford all the  we need them to buy from us for the stock market & all your stocks to do well. Talk about fair? Know how much they pay for oil & gas? Know why we pay so little relatively? Know *how* advantageous cheaper oil is?

8877 2018-08-06 07:06:43 In a way, palm oil production is much worse than animal-testing. It's directly link to deforestation (which destroys habitat for many endangered species), climate change, indigenous rights abuses, AND animal cruelty. But it's very difficult to avoid as it's often hidden.

 You'd be arrested for not wearing an abaya now - it's the law. Only wives of prominent politicians get away with Western dress without an abaya now unless you live in a Saudi oil compound. Outside a compound an abaya is needed to put rubbish out.

8975 2018-08-06 06:53:11 it would only be beneficial for Alberta if other countries shut out Saudi Arabia too, creating more trade with Alberta. Otherwise, it'll just minimize trade because of demand for oil within the country.

9055 2018-08-06 06:37:40 Saudi arabias economy is entirely dependent on oil and would not survive with out it. Oil is THE SINGLE REASON that your government is in power, and its your only source of wealth.
9056 2018-08-06 06:37:36 It was a harper deal that went through after Trudeau got in power from my understanding. We should have nothing to do with this country in my opinion. Build that damn energy east pipeline to our refineries, stop all imports of oil from saudi and be done with them once and for all

9121 2018-08-06 06:23:32 No because most Muslims have been born into non believing families from the time of the prophet Muhammad pbuh which is why the rich Arabs with oil only make up about 2% of Muslims and Arabs as a whole 9% roughly.

You are being given the information and it is down to you...

9153 2018-08-06 06:19:46 I hope you feel better! That hurts so bad. I dont know how you feel about essential oils or if you have a tub, but if you take a hot bath and put about 12 drops of clove oil it helps with sore muscles.

9164 2018-08-06 06:18:27 doesn't Canada rely on a large amount of Saudi oil?

9170 2018-08-06 06:17:07 Valiantly putting on the (now undersized) wedding ring today. Just remember to use olive oil or some form of lubricant when taking it off later.
9171 2018-08-06 06:16:41 Castor oil smells like puke 
9172 2018-08-06 06:16:37 Too bad it is our fault that the islamic hard liners got into power over there. The Shah was very pro America but the oil guys whispered in Carter’s ears that we needed the oil rights over there. So we helped install the “innocent” religious guys who promptly turned on us.

9174 2018-08-06 06:16:25 Lost billions of dollars how? Don’t worry, Saudi oil is garbage anyway. Next time, tell your oil surveyors not to prop up the diminishing oil reserve numbers the KSA has. Our Canadian oil reserves will last/outlive the KSA for thousands of years. Trading with Iran is way better!

9195 2018-08-06 06:12:49 Why is it they can invent a spray to kill wasps, flies, ants, cockroaches but still nothing to kill spiders? Currently my bedroom smells like a sweet shop as I try peppermint oil as a deterrent for these horrible creatures #spiderterror

But IRT "bad environmental laws," plenty of those because of you and the @GOP administration -- harming our health and national parks. 

The big profits are in new applied-science industries that make energy w/o pollution. Not coal or oil.

9257 2018-08-06 06:03:18 Agreed. Side note- the term snake oil came from a man who traveled selling Echinacea extract. He didn't know the name of the plant, Yet it did cure many ailments! Still does! But without a proper name, it got labeled snake oil. Just thought that was interesting history.

9310 2018-08-06 05:52:58 I will need to look up the trade deficit. I suspect we buy a lot more (ie: Eastern Canada buying oil) from them than they buy from us.
9311 2018-08-06 05:52:48 You will need just two to three drops of the lemon oil. That thing is very concentrated and it burnssssss
9312 2018-08-06 05:52:41 I put oil in my hair everyday & it doesn't even matter...
9313 2018-08-06 05:52:33 including those related to Tejas-LCA by companies like 'Lockheed Martin' !
Back home, there's a whole brigade of our own journalists who have been burning midnight oil in writing articles justifying IMPORT from the same US, of Combat Aircrafts like F16 and F18 of 1970s vintage!
9314 2018-08-06 05:52:32 She reminds me of oil sitting on water

A dab, her touch upon my cheek 
Leaving a delicate impression of time.

9318 2018-08-06 05:52:07 I thought this thread was light and humorous until I read some of the comments. Scotland voted to be part of the union. The UK subsidy to Scotland has soared since the oil collapse. Don't understand this bile...

9325 2018-08-06 05:51:07 On the bright side maybe the lack of fuel oil on the East coast during winter will encourage the maritimers to drive the Saudi Arabia destined weapons to Ottawa ...

9345 2018-08-06 05:47:40 Sorry, but I failed to see what he said that’s so wrong? Multiculturalism doesn’t work because our values are too different, like oil on water. So what’s wrong with being selective about the people we allow to come to our countries? Makes sense to me...
9346 2018-08-06 05:47:40 Deceptive. Destructive. Deceitful. Duplicitous.

He's a snake oil salesman who uses conspiracy theories, doomsday fiction, homophobic rhetoric, and fallacious disinformation to sell his useless, largely-unregulated products.

An anti-vaxxer, too. 280 characters just isn't enough.
9347 2018-08-06 05:47:24 This would have happened/was beginning to happen under Chavez, too. But he’d had a decade of historically high oil prices, and he made the mistake of just spending the proceeds, not diversifying the economy, and now Maduro is paying the price. That’s your basic answer, isn’t it?

9432 2018-08-06 05:33:57 I agree with you Pauline - every human being in Australia consumes almost 7 tonnes  of oil every year for heating, cooling, transport etc. you can’t accept climate change and want more people - the 2 are “mutually exclusive”

9433 2018-08-06 05:33:56 Hey....... nothing wrong with our oil sands product..... but we might need some Texas crude. Haha
9434 2018-08-06 05:33:50 Just to be clear though, the Liberals want you to know that it's OK to commit these sorts of human rights abuses and we'll still buy your oil. Better that folks like this in Saudi Arabia get our money than those dreadful Albertans.
9435 2018-08-06 05:33:49 Ironically Brexit bringing down the value of the pound is a good thing for all the oil revenue figures, as oil is priced in $. Of course, the flip side is it may increase production costs so the companies won’t make as much profit.

9440 2018-08-06 05:32:55 I think tomorrow I’m finally gonna get my oil changed and prob see if they can patch my tire since it’s been losing air 
9441 2018-08-06 05:31:45 There are two primary value chains in Nigeria: 1. The crude oil value chain (includes a lot of govt work) 2. The consumer essentials value chain. So long income levels are where they are, those two remain where significant tech business opportunity lie.

9454 2018-08-06 05:30:06 Didn’t oil production double under obama...
9455 2018-08-06 05:29:58 In 2016, Canada imported 87,000 barrels of oil per day from the Saudi’s
9456 2018-08-06 05:29:19 The real issue to me is that since the cold war Russia has been trying to create problems for the US to get on board to be dual superpowers and with Russia being big oil and the US being pro fracking that is why Trump and Putin are seemingly close.
9457 2018-08-06 05:29:13 What was done in the 60s/70s has little relevance now. Yes the U.K. possibly should have set up an oil fund, but it didn’t happen. It’s history now, and wanting to lose the extra £1437 per person per year that we can spend on public services simply because of that is daft.

9465 2018-08-06 05:27:37 That is our part. We dont get to opt out. Oil sands Canada's biggest polluters.
9466 2018-08-06 05:27:35 We have oil, other than that you don't make anything. Is there a global market for sand?
9467 2018-08-06 05:27:26 SMDH besides Gioia's and don't know the donut place but is there such a thing as a bad piece of batter dropped in oil and covered in sugae? Check out strange donuts though.

2. If you have a yard, or any outside opportunity to make a fire (e.g. fire bowl) burn some green walnut leaves.

9477 2018-08-06 05:25:57 Turns out I cannot find any information on a rare old Joshua Reynolds oil painting I acquired, the other copy is in #scotland
9478 2018-08-06 05:25:22 Funny considering Canada is the top country when It comes to selling Oil to America.
9479 2018-08-06 05:25:22 Mmm I love a good vinaigrette. We picked up one recently that has grapefruit oil blended in and oh man, so good. Best salad I've had in a while
9480 2018-08-06 05:25:20 Funny how eastern Canada  buys their oil but we talk about their human rights violations.
9481 2018-08-06 05:25:14 it's p noisy right now for some reason
9482 2018-08-06 05:25:07 We all know when all bees die in earth we all will follow, right? Is that his agenda, kill all humans? Starve them to death? When the last deer is killed, the last fish out, the last river dry, we will see if people can eat money, gold, silver, oil.
9483 2018-08-06 05:24:44 And it further debunks the BS about Qc not buying AB oil, all at once. 9B reversal's purpose was exactly that. Your narrative that we're putting our energy supply at risk with SA issue is simply. We'll simply buy from other countries without an issue. You're far too dramatic!
9484 2018-08-06 05:24:39 Lazy coward Trudeau should stop importing oil from them and Venezuala

In 2016, Canada imported 87,000 barrels of oil per day from the Saudi’s
9485 2018-08-06 05:24:36 We control oil on the planet..and that's a fact wether u like it or not
9486 2018-08-06 05:24:28 oil shows are a beautiful PAIN
9487 2018-08-06 05:24:16 Brent Crude Oil $73.47
US$/Rs. 68.55
Propylene $1090 CFR China
Ethylene $1240 CFR SEA
Naphtha $660 CFR Japan
Styrene $1,485 CFR China
9488 2018-08-06 05:24:14 Wrong, second largest oil reserve. Venezuela has a larger one. But it was a nice attempt.

Saudis seem pretty happy to leave that country. I have met numerous Saudis who are so grateful to leave. Can you blame them? They are leaving a theocratic dictatorial state.
9489 2018-08-06 05:24:01 And yet my cardiologist recommend 3g of fish oil daily. And synthetic EPA has been approved by FDA for reduction of high triglycerides.
9490 2018-08-06 05:23:36 We don’t need it we barely get any oil from there what worries me is we are last country in North America that isn’t a dictatorship all this whille the world is on fire

9493 2018-08-06 05:23:13 Canada has the world's third-largest oil reserves. But even so we are already on the move to clean energy now. But please, ignore all the human right issues and keep working on your oils, I'm sure it's the most sustainable thing to do in the 21st century.

9496 2018-08-06 05:22:38 And Barack gave us the ACA (which strangely tripled working class payments while saddling them with $5K deductables, profiting insurance companies) while accelerating the drone and proxy war on anti-imperialist persons of color. Obama made War for Oil cool again via Libya.

9499 2018-08-06 05:22:09 What you mean by (Western Ethical Oil)?
9500 2018-08-06 05:22:05 Why would we buy oil from them ? Must be cheaper
9501 2018-08-06 05:21:36 The problem is saudi oil is the cheapest oil to extract. And they have enough to flood the market and make all our oil reliant economies crash. Hence why the usa have them the 300 billion weapons deal and we put up with wahhabists stuck in feudalism.
9502 2018-08-06 05:21:31 #Sana Oil. hahahaha
9503 2018-08-06 05:21:24 Still mainly soybean oil. You can buy or make better mayonnaise than this one.
9504 2018-08-06 05:21:24 I hope I get the job for the oil field

9513 2018-08-06 05:20:33 That is pretty much my diet, animal protein (of all kinds) roots, pumpkins, veg, fruit, and a few nuts and seeds, and of course olive oil and femented grapes
9514 2018-08-06 05:20:28 Reagan was an opportunist like @SenShelby ! Not a true Democrat. No Anti-Abortion/Anti-Women politician would be a true democrat! I know there r some but is like Oil on water! Not Compatible! Democrats are for #prochoice #prowomen ! #dnc

9516 2018-08-06 05:20:02 Haha.. Oil is still valuable dear.
9517 2018-08-06 05:19:29 Canada is in 3rd in Oil reserves. Let’s not buy anymore Oil from the desert people!

9522 2018-08-06 05:19:10 Election campaigning has started already. But, lets keep quiet about the fact Canada imports Saudi oil while banning Canadian oil.
9523 2018-08-06 05:19:05 I hope you realize both are using Saudi Arabia as a puppet for Oil, and you'll find a majority of people agreeing with that statement. You know yourself without Oil, SA is quiet useless.
9524 2018-08-06 05:19:04 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
9525 2018-08-06 05:18:55 Omg did anyone notice the banner thing at the bottom when she was talking about trump and calling him a snake oil salesman? It said "next, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton".... wowee.

@jkenney @JustinTrudeau @CPC_HQ @liberal_party @FriendsOScience
9532 2018-08-06 05:17:27 It IS true, and second at 9%-third coming in at 9% as well. Basically debunks your theory that our energy supply is at risk with the newest CANADA/SA problems. I guess you didn't even know we imported more from UK and Norway than SA. Look up May 2018 oil imports on Statscan.
9533 2018-08-06 05:17:12 I can’t sleep without my lavender in my oil diffuser  #TheLittleThings
9534 2018-08-06 05:17:10 Have you ever been to Canada? I know 34 Canadians named Tarek. It’s a multicultural nation, a concept you as a Saudi may fail to grasp.  But remember, the children of Canada will inherit a still wealthy country while Saudi children will inherit one where oil is no longer needed.
9535 2018-08-06 05:16:59 You need to slather that shit in tea tree oil and vasoline :0

9544 2018-08-06 05:16:21 some lavender essential oil pls
9545 2018-08-06 05:16:16 I love how the #CPC is keen to slam pipeline activism, but utterly silent that those activist groups are funded by American oil companies driving down the price of oil so they can buy it cheap and sell it back to us at a greatly inflated profit.

9550 2018-08-06 05:15:37 Not economically because of oil, but if we define Third World Countries in terms of political rights and civil liberties then they are in the top 17 of most repressive nations in the world.

9570 2018-08-06 05:13:39 15 % sugar isn't impt.. really 

But it is obvious that the combined load of refined grain, seed oil & sugar is more impt.
9571 2018-08-06 05:13:38 I am curious how much water is used in fracking that never returns to the water cycle. @OilGasCanada @RachelNotley @jkenney @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer  I guess water will be the rate limiting step for the oil industry in AB. Water is more important than oil.
9572 2018-08-06 05:13:32 You're too focused on environment when there is absolutely nothing we can do. Environmentalists could have supported pipelines. Canada could have prevented tons of CO2 by not needing oil imports by diesel ships and trains. While we continue to sell weapons to the Saudis

9581 2018-08-06 05:12:15 She was @HartsonForCA and one of the ideas she had was transitioning away from Fossil Fuels by offering Oil field employees first dibs and free training to green Economy jobs in Solar/Wind industries, and offering incentive through tax breaks for companies that transition.
9582 2018-08-06 05:11:48 These are not assets to sell you are describing. Defense is an expenditure.  Oil companies get tax breaks. Personally, I like a flat tax with no tax breaks for anybody, but there's still not enough in the budget to give a universal basic income.  How much does everyone get?
9583 2018-08-06 05:11:48 its funny how a plane that was 18 deep & majority oil workers conveniently crashes killing all 18 people right around the time we have a major oil problem, how phucking convenient....

9588 2018-08-06 05:10:58 Charlie Angus clearly knows that the Saudi regime is extremely wealthy (but only because of oil deposits, not because of political skill). But YOU do not seem to understand that it is still worthwhile for Canada to take a principled stand for #HumanRights. We Canadians applaud!

9598 2018-08-06 05:08:35 You sell them armoured vehicles to kill their own, and you suddenly decided this is worth the fight. How about take care of getting some trades done for Canada. Stop selling them weapons, get pipelines going use our own oil and save billions by not buying theirs! Stupid priority
9599 2018-08-06 05:08:10 Hugo Chavez was the main man despite the disdain treatment by the US and the West. He left the stage and everything tumbled on downward spiral. Nicholas Maduro is a joke. Never mind it's got the largest oil reserves in the world .

9629 2018-08-06 05:04:35 Self regulated oil companies will produce reports to influence local authorities to make decisions that are not acceptable. Furthermore insurance for the property will be precarious and housing prices will drop significantly
9630 2018-08-06 05:04:15 Hopefully this is an eye-opener for @JustinTrudeau that relying on our own oil is far superior to relying on foreign oil, regardless of the source country. Energy East, Trans Mountain & all pipeline project need to be given serious thought & approvals expedited with safety checks

9633 2018-08-06 05:04:00 This is really troubling because I do want to be cruelty-free but am shocked how many products use palm oil masked under alternative names (vegetable oil, glycerin, etc.) Will have to read the label even more carefully from now on.

9645 2018-08-06 05:03:03 Wrong: as sweet crude became more scare oil companies and car manufacturers instead started refining the much more destructive, polluting, and harder to refine tar sands, because the scarcity of sweet crude made it profitable.

9703 2018-08-06 04:54:27 Nothing wrong with Maduro's policies. The issue is USA economic sanctions have been perfected. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela cannot sell its Oil reserves. They cannot even give away the Oil free of charge because their oil tankers are deemed unfit to sail in the open seas.

9718 2018-08-06 04:52:21 From the first article i read on this it wasnt trudeau that said the thing that pised saudis off. And if they want to stop shipping oil to us i dont see a problem. Except they own our wheat board...but hat was a huge mistake in the first place

9723 2018-08-06 04:51:53 Don't forget that his self righteous journalist of a foreign minister just pissed off the preferred supplier of "Oil by Trudeau". Bet he doesn't interrupt his precious vacation to address that either.

9732 2018-08-06 04:50:43 It’s bullshit. Plain and simple. Snake oil until it works.

9734 2018-08-06 04:50:23 Do you remember tucking your right pant leg into your sock when you rode your bike, so your pant leg wouldn't get caught in the chain, but then you'd get oil on your sock?
9735 2018-08-06 04:50:17 With the reversal of Line 9, refineries in Quebec are less dependent on international imports. Refineries in NL/LB and NB (Irving) are much more dependent. My guess is that most Saudi oil is going to NL & NB refineries.
9736 2018-08-06 04:50:06 East coast tanker ban. Build energy east pipeline. No more Saudi oil in north America ever again.
9737 2018-08-06 04:49:59 Because Quebec and BC won’t let us get our oil to tidewater and no government seems to have balls to force them too. So until that happens we will forever be dependent on foreign oil.
9738 2018-08-06 04:49:42 he's also peddling a book of laughable fiction so he already knows his audience will buy anything.....essentially he's just a literary snake oil dude that only appears in safe spaces where he's never challenged.
9739 2018-08-06 04:49:26 asking lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist Alex to not be a dumbass is like asking a fish to not swim.
9740 2018-08-06 04:49:24 Why did you comment? I simply don't understand the point you're trying to make. My point is simple: We should stop buying SA oil. Period.

Going for sweet/salty, probably could use some toasted sesame oil and rice wine vinegar if I had any around

9750 2018-08-06 04:48:12 I feel you bro  I make 16$ an hour at a truck stop. Thinking about quiting after my paid vaycay to twitchcon and getting an oil field job. But that would put the stream on the back burner so idkkk

9758 2018-08-06 04:46:56 ROFL... Canada didn't import anything. Private companies imported that oil and private companies exported 500% more than they imported making the point moot anyway.

9774 2018-08-06 04:45:31 sorry Marcus, but that is not the reason... a concentrated work force, lack of diversification... top heavy... even if oil reached $100 is not going to be the same again ... all industry and commerce is changing

9780 2018-08-06 04:45:03 Will see. Saudi needs Canada as it's draining the region of potential military aged combatants. Just Shanghai has 24 million ppl, so China could pick up Canada's oil volume in a second ..  what a diversion... When bubbleboy gets back to Ottawa expect a lot of virtue...lol
9781 2018-08-06 04:45:00  Islamic radicalism in India is also coz of Saudi money flowing into madarsas and mosques. Till 70s, Islam was by and large moderate in India. After the oil boom, along with petro-dollars came Saudi funds and Wahhabi influenced Islam. Time to kick these mullahs out.

9796 2018-08-06 04:42:56 I will never be ashamed, there’s many facts and articles that back both sides, the reality is, oil isn’t going anywhere
9797 2018-08-06 04:42:41 I so agree with and appreciate all you say. Very frightening. Robert Fisk wrote an article months ago about Saudi and Russia wanting to reconfigure the Middle East so they can control the region and oil. I think they may  have sights set on Iran.
9798 2018-08-06 04:42:37 何それ気になる
9799 2018-08-06 04:42:26 Canada needs to use its own oil but it needs pipelines!

9801 2018-08-06 04:42:17 Chamisa's English is like liquid oil i bet you can spend the whole day just wanting to hear from him
9802 2018-08-06 04:42:15 Canada is so hypocritical, we don't charge a carbon tax on imported oil. If we did they would just ship to different country that don't tax them. So we are actually supporting the anti carbon tax countries. So wrong. But so is carbon tax.

Technology advances. Fact we can get energy from waves, sun, wind is a godsend. Suprised you can't see potential for reducing energy dependence on other nations.

I accept it can't replace oil, renewables can provide energy though.
9812 2018-08-06 04:41:13 Is it true that Pakistan’s shale oil and gas reserves are estimated to be 700 times of Pakistan’s entire foreign debt?
9813 2018-08-06 04:40:57 I think we are along way from a day when renewables will replace oil.
9814 2018-08-06 04:40:55 I bought some ingredients to make my own. Plus I’ve been reading about other things like coconut oil that has natural SPF. I have an indoors office job and don’t really get out much (lol) so my beach day is was unusual for me.

9833 2018-08-06 04:38:12 When will this country learn to smarten up n refine our own damn oil!!!
9834 2018-08-06 04:38:10 Yeah, Trump doesn’t care about the people of Iran. Putin doesn’t care about the people of Iran. They only care about oil and power. If America strikes Iran its purpose will be to draw attention away from Trump’s scandals.
9835 2018-08-06 04:38:05 The Trump admin is working on broad changes 2 the Endangered Species Act as well as opening federal forests 2 logging, oil & gas drilling. This tweet appears 2 tie the fires 2 both policy goals w/out any evidence that they r key factors in the state’s devastating fire season.
9836 2018-08-06 04:38:03 Wow! Ang laki naman ng rollback nila, it will be a great help to us! Kudos to the oil companies!More power!

9838 2018-08-06 04:37:49 If “Magnitsky Act” = “Russian Adoptions” maybe we should refer to Jr. being thrown under the bus as a “Russian Oil Change”.

9839 2018-08-06 04:36:57 But you're always reminded the oil one works right
9840 2018-08-06 04:36:46 You can bet Hamish is arming the troll army for an assault since it's all Trudeau's fault for buying oil from SA. Already seen that ridiculous argument.

9849 2018-08-06 04:35:44 Oh wait she's a peanut so I guess that's a peanut oil bottle #BBAD #OGNO #BB20 how nutty of me to think differently
9850 2018-08-06 04:35:26 First, tarsands are in L.A.; AB has oilsands. With Energy East gone the east depends on foreign oil via tanker
9851 2018-08-06 04:35:16 That's true but the oil and natural gas industries making things worse. Destroying our planet for a profit and paying politicians like Trump to tell them it isn't happening, plus pushing for laws that allow them to make things worse. {{-_-}}
9852 2018-08-06 04:35:02 Hey Wendy the east has done every thing they can to cripple Canadian oil from reaching tidewater they’ve stone walled every company that wanted to set up refineries thus keeping us dependent on foreign oil. Yes we have lots of oil in the ground but it’s basically useless to us.
9853 2018-08-06 04:34:51 Just sayin if this GLF oil actually gets rid of this gallstone I will forever testify for essential oils

9855 2018-08-06 04:34:49 We are using very little Saudi oil and considering where it is being used it would be very easy to change suppliers.
9856 2018-08-06 04:34:19 Have to imagine if it wasn’t Chrystia or other woman telling Saudi Arabia what to do we would still be having more dealings with that really bad place, no oil to or from you, Love always Alberta
9857 2018-08-06 04:34:12 JT 's short sighted ignorance on display. Kill EE then piss off one of the east's main oil suppliers. You couldn't make this stuff up.

9866 2018-08-06 04:33:11 Lol socialists now defending socialism by saying Vzla isnt' a socialist regime. How different socialism looks now from the Vzlan one of $100 oil. If you lefties would be humbler to admit your ideological mistake, millions of lives could be saved from historical socialism results.
9867 2018-08-06 04:33:00 Those are all great people to follow.
9868 2018-08-06 04:32:54 Get some hard foam material cut it into a tablet the size of half a coke can soak it in oil we use canola. Run it thru. Auger kleen make a kit.
9869 2018-08-06 04:32:51 It's the oil and natural gas industries polluting the atmosphere and changing the weather tying all of our hands behind our backs at gunpoint. I'm sure Trump has gotten sizable donations from them. Not about left or right. {{-_-}}
9870 2018-08-06 04:32:43 Wonder how many wells make 125,000 bbl of oil before making 1,000,000 bbl of water.

9872 2018-08-06 04:32:40 Hysterical Howard.  You hate gabe kapler.  He's managing a first place team that wasn't expected to do anything and you will not acknowledge it. I smell sour grapes. 
I'll send you some coconut oil.

9890 2018-08-06 04:30:19 I feel like I’m the only one who thinks coconut oil smells disgusting
9891 2018-08-06 04:30:09 Essential oils man. If you don’t have any, get them. And magnesium oil / spray. Especially if you have trouble sleeping.

9894 2018-08-06 04:29:38 Put some olive oil on your skin. It heals sunburn. My grandma did this for me when i was badly sunburned and even clothing stung, it turned into a beautiful deep tan soon and it helped so much <3
9895 2018-08-06 04:29:29 We import about 90,000 barrels of Saudi oil per day.
9896 2018-08-06 04:29:25 The Saudi Arabia fiasco we have going on might be a good thing. Maybe it means using Alberta oil instead of Saudi oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli

9901 2018-08-06 04:29:02 So I went downstairs, sliced the tomatoes and added basil, feta, balsamic & olive oil. And for my efforts I fried up some french fries. Followed all that with a couple of small cookies.
9902 2018-08-06 04:28:46 We could start by not buying their oil. (if only there were a way to get Alberta oil to the East)
9903 2018-08-06 04:28:33 that's what you get from this news? you have no issue doing business with a country with a horrible record on Human Rights if you are going to get cheap oil?  
if you want cheap energy concentrate on renewals, green energy.
9904 2018-08-06 04:28:30 You are the reason I started buying BubbaBurgers. They are the best burgers.
9905 2018-08-06 04:28:25 I’ve been taking cbd oil for almost a week now and I think it’s helping !!!

9909 2018-08-06 04:27:57 I touch no other oil except Coconut oil since then. Two days ago I went to the Chemist to buy strips for my Vero tester n I had the privilege talking to the Chemist who’s a strong LCHF believer n she uses it but cannot spread it to her patients as it’s not..
9910 2018-08-06 04:27:51 Floods in the east. Droughts and fires in the west. Be nice if the two could balance each other.  I’m thinking @boringcompany tunnels and @Tesla solar powered pumps moving water through pipelines instead of oil.
9911 2018-08-06 04:27:05 One of my good friends in the oil field just said to me "Money isn't everything. I just wanna be home." 

Yesssss. Money isn't everything.
9912 2018-08-06 04:26:57 We buy mostly American oil!

9914 2018-08-06 04:26:42 i always use shampoo and conditioners w coconut or coconut oil in them & i wash my hair every other day. & if i blow dry i always use a diffuser
9915 2018-08-06 04:26:42 How much Saudi oil do we actually import??
9916 2018-08-06 04:26:37 Agree that playoffs are on a different level but tonight has been just fine and this B9 has been fantastic.
9917 2018-08-06 04:26:19 You have sweet oil.  If it weren't for your oil that doesn't take as much refining as our bituminous muck I doubt there'd not be much reason to deal with you.
9918 2018-08-06 04:26:14 "engine oil attack on Vivekanand" it may be a diplomatic term used by @ShashiTharoor sahab, which has serious deep meaning, u must try to decode it, hahahaha

9921 2018-08-06 04:25:23 Left blames oil companies & wants a carbon tax. President’s measures build $ reserves for future action but are potentially adverse. Neither side is willing to sacrifice thru reduced demand - which is the most immediate, impactful and cost-effective action. So both are to blame.
9922 2018-08-06 04:25:19 We don't think humans have colonized Antarctica or the deep oceans, for instance, although we have tourists and scientists on the former and oil wells and commercial offshore divers servicing them in the latter.
9923 2018-08-06 04:25:18 I ignored her n used it.. when she saw my results 3 months later, she started using it.. Id say the researchers years ago tested the Processed refined coconut oil depleted of its Laurie Acid.. They didn’t know then!!

Side Note: I have combination skin. & I wash my face in the morning & at night.
9926 2018-08-06 04:24:41 You can order the oil online and take it straight or they have muscle balms you can rub on your muscles. I got some cbd honey from local beekeepers at a monthly market here in my town. I put it in my dad's coffee and it helps with his digestive issues too
9927 2018-08-06 04:24:33 Get your green on. Saute some kale with olive oil, garlic &amp; lemon. Amazing side dish.

9932 2018-08-06 04:23:37 Your doubts are genuining because #France and #Britain are blind allies who do not see the wrongs of each other. Maybe their meeting is about new resources and oil deals over #SouthernCameroons. Who knows what they will conspire about because the blood of people matters not.
9933 2018-08-06 04:23:30 Like I've said all along. The prize is the Golan Heights oil region. Tricky Dick and his goons.
9934 2018-08-06 04:23:27 I really doubt it. Canada has oil, lumber and water...
9935 2018-08-06 04:23:15 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
9936 2018-08-06 04:23:15 I was already on the same diet but different oil.. It was the coconut oil as I passed it on to a cousin who had high LDL, it helped her.. We have both been using Cocpnut oil ever since. At first my partner told me: please don’t use it, it’s bad for you..

9952 2018-08-06 04:20:45 Seriously? So we should cut down the trees? Maybe we should allow coal companies to dump debris into our streams or lift a freeze on new coal leases on public land or allow oil companies to continue to pollute our air. Dr. Seuss’ “The Lorax” tells your story; it doesn’t end well.
9953 2018-08-06 04:20:32 By the time Ruto gets into power, the country will be so heavily in debt and the coffers empty. His options will be to tax us heavily which won't work, beg for foreign Aid or auction our resources, oil and mau forest.
9954 2018-08-06 04:20:30 If only Saudi Arabia would cut off oil to Canada. Then we'd see how quickly that Energy East pipeline would get approved.

9957 2018-08-06 04:19:57 I use hog bristle and semi-stiff synthetic for oils, but I also like my paint super thick/buttery. I was never very picky about brushes for acrylic or oil; watercolor is where brushes have really mattered in my experience. You will want one big-ass brush, a filbert, & a round.
9958 2018-08-06 04:19:27 #EnergyEast. It wouldn't hurt to have some Canadian-based oil refineries again, either.
9959 2018-08-06 04:19:21 Oil??.. I thought it was butter 
9960 2018-08-06 04:19:15 The untapped potential of the Alberta Oil sands supply more than enough for Canadian needs. The Atlantic provinces use Saudi oil because it is cheaper. The rest of Canada use oil from Alberta.

9967 2018-08-06 04:18:05 Doubtful and beyond our control anyhow but Canada should cut off all oil from Saudi Arabia now. 

Alas, Liberals are too cowardly.

9970 2018-08-06 04:17:19 I use it with unscented lotion. It’s really potent (the oil) so 1-2 drops in each pump of lotion is good.

Stop the Energy East pipeline and leave Canadian oil in the ground. Clueless!
9983 2018-08-06 04:15:54 Spain & Portugal have had the highest Temps in history at 122F. @realDonaldTrump took U.S. out of Climate Accord to satisfy his Billionaire buddies in big oil & gas & other polluting corporations. Probably huge kick backs. The U.S. is now only Country in World not signed on.
