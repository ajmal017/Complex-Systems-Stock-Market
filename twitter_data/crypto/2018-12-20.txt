160 2018-12-20 23:37:05 This  Even worse because I'm a designer to get legitimate jobs I had to go back for a shitty piece of paper. I learnt nothing and wasted a year to get some paper that says I can do what I was already doing 
161 2018-12-20 23:36:55 Current crypto situation reminds me of the weed industry a few years back... tons of money floating around, and a lot of blurry lines in terms of what is legal/not legal.
162 2018-12-20 23:36:47 The one thing I admire about him is he's sticking to his guns. Lots of talking heads were happy to ride the crypto market while it was going up, then turn around and act like they had nothing to do with it after it crashed.
163 2018-12-20 23:36:42 Good things abounding, like the Token Taxonomy Act bill.  #crypto
164 2018-12-20 23:36:29 #Citizens of the #UK we hope  #BREXIT won’t happen, but if it does, especially #HardBREXIT protect yourself against a #RunOnThePound. Buy #Gold , #Dollars #cryptocurrency. The best #Crypto in an Economic meltdown is $XBI think of it as eXtreme Brexit Insurance. @XBIncognito

You sure do a lot of crypto law, you should consider joining Costco Law. Hours are flexible, the pay is sh!t, but the clients are.... Well they can suck too
168 2018-12-20 23:35:48 Yeah... The Trudeau Packaging Comoany.
169 2018-12-20 23:35:40 そうなんですよね。あくまでも形式の一つ。
結婚して出産して～なんて、理想ではあっても必然ではない。
でもメディアはそういう認識って美味しくないのかも(”問題”があるからこそ燃料になる)

認識を変えるには時間がかかると思いますが、凄く大事ですよね・・・
170 2018-12-20 23:35:14 Exactly. I just stack up more USD. 

I have so much to learn about TA and crypto as a whole that I don't feel comfortable not having a guaranteed source of income.
171 2018-12-20 23:35:10 Venezuela  digging a bigger hole if they use crypto.
172 2018-12-20 23:35:08 True man I feel you I work in a hospital too and im reasonably healthy but I get a dirty filthy pizza every Sunday and I love it 
Other people need help, probably mental and educational, because they're addicted to shit food but most control themselves
173 2018-12-20 23:34:44 各交通機関が優先座席みたいにアナウンスすれば、少しは理解度が増す気がしますね！
174 2018-12-20 23:34:43 college is 5 years of moving across the country away from your family and friends and going into debt, just to get educated for a job with no openings close to your family/friends. 

Monetarily it may or may not be worth it 15 years down the line. happiness wise though?

177 2018-12-20 23:33:50 Get outta muh head. I was doing the same earlier. I stopped to finish writing up an eval. Hopefully, I’ll get back at it once I’m home.
178 2018-12-20 23:33:39 Yeah he was "crypto hedge fund manager" for a while.  Probably just back to "fast money trader" now.
179 2018-12-20 23:33:38 He probably shut down his account himself.
180 2018-12-20 23:33:29 It was great @mappopk_crypto

201 2018-12-20 23:31:04 It wouldn't be so bad if people were honest about it. No harm in saying cannot predict it but don't give predictions blatantly supporting ones own agenda (A.Hayes, and Fundstrat fund manager out of that crowd). That's what crypto gamblers do - live on hope

203 2018-12-20 23:30:54 Having an education isn't wrong , what is wrong is the way we are providing it. 

Today we learn more from a youtube video tutorial but schools insist in continuing with the old teacher/blackboard/expensive/ 
 chalk/unflexible/traditional/
education/system of our grandparents.
204 2018-12-20 23:30:52 Calling everything other than your preferred crypto a "shitcoin" is not a good look, and does not make uncommitted people more likely to agree with you.

207 2018-12-20 23:30:25 Hahaha, finaly the truth. From the start it was obviously a CB trashtalk mission and Denarius just served as puppet on the string for the purpose.
208 2018-12-20 23:30:06 3 months to make that money.. i would give up trading right now and find a job ^^
209 2018-12-20 23:30:06 (実際にはVPS代がRewardを上回る現実ｗ)
210 2018-12-20 23:29:54 The hardest part about working a full-time job and doing this crypto thing is that I can literally make my entire year's salary in a span of a week (like this week).

How can I justify getting up for work 300 days out of the year, when I make that money in one week in my boxers.
211 2018-12-20 23:29:53 Umm yeah the world sort of needs doctors, nurses, scientists, accountants etc etc

216 2018-12-20 23:29:30 かっこいいこと言ってるようで言ってないw
217 2018-12-20 23:29:27 " It's too late to stop Bitcoin"- The government should understand  that. The Bitcoin doesn't have any company, organisation, or any centralised server, the network is completely distributed and decentralised, it is practically impossible to stop or hack Bitcoin network.
218 2018-12-20 23:29:05 good
219 2018-12-20 23:29:02 Crypto gives the average person an opportunity to invest in businesses at all stages that match their interests. No minimum net worth requirement to be an early seed investor. No minimum amount of shares. The utility of what you invest in determines the outcome of the economy.
220 2018-12-20 23:28:57 At last some like minded individuals in here! It seems that crypto traders are full of bias on either side and it is irritating. Thank you for your wisdom sir.

...But probly.
259 2018-12-20 23:24:45 We don't announce this ahead of time to prevent market manipulation, but once the buyback is done we will make a statement on how many XT were bought, as well as provide proof of burn.
260 2018-12-20 23:24:37 The United States will not make or break Bitcoin or Crypto...we all seem to be overly focused on this and the exchanges that are coming. I hope foreign countries buy all the Bitcoin! SEC has been dragging their feet for too long.
261 2018-12-20 23:24:30 Not a crypto currency BTW xd
262 2018-12-20 23:24:30 You know how I can tell the difference between a great crypto project and bad one just by social media?

If the account just RTs content instead of creating their own.

That alone can save you $1,000,000 in picking projects 
263 2018-12-20 23:24:29 Again, thank you sir

269 2018-12-20 23:23:39 事実婚に対しての扱いが良いですよね。結婚なんて、別に一つの形式でしかない。
そっち方面も意識変えていくの大事そうですねー。
まあ不倫が横行しているので実質的にはもう実現してるのかもしれませんが笑

なんにせよ、子供が後ろめたくないとか、そういうのが一番大事だと思うんですよね。

293 2018-12-20 23:21:18 As much as we all want this dreaded bear market to end, we need to endure it for a little while longer so all these scam coins can bleed dry.

#Crypto will be a much better and safer place if 1/2 these $alt coins die!

Sideways actions for the next 4-6 months would be best!

301 2018-12-20 23:20:18 For an average trader/crypto hoarder this could be considered a downside. Because this basically means free money every time a fork occurs. And you know how greedy people are.

305 2018-12-20 23:19:37 Central banks are reducing liquidity, which can be quite problematic when debt is so high. 

Quantitative indicators based on trend-following and relative strength are saying that it is time to protect your portfolio.

339 2018-12-20 23:14:54 You're wrong. Here's why.

All airdropped coins whom still circulate within crypto markets have a value relative to another crypto such as $btc or a fiat currency. Therefore, they have value.

I know what you are trying to say but you didn't state it right and therefore are wrong
340 2018-12-20 23:14:49 Its so funny that the DOW and other stock markets goes down today and is expected to decrease further but this whole week #bitcoin and #crypto value and trading volume been going up these hedge fund managers are moving their $$ into crypto, something bad is about happen

342 2018-12-20 23:14:13 You are seriously mistaken about the maturity and fundamentals of crypto. Finally, if charting had worked the way you imply, you would be a billionaire. Bitcoin is something very precious and should be accumulated.

348 2018-12-20 23:12:57 I think a big part of it for me was taking money out of the game. If I have enough sitting around not doing anything, I feel comfortable to make decisions in crypto without worrying about losing.

354 2018-12-20 23:11:55 ime crypto, unlike stock, moves much more in accordance w/what people are thinking. highly dependent on news, w “behind the scenes” stuff(or complex financial algorithms) rarely being the main factor unless the coin is a scam. i don’t blame u being suspicious.

366 2018-12-20 23:10:20  money isn't everything buddy. Helps to have it but then you lose sight of what actually matters.
367 2018-12-20 23:10:15 That is my assumption.Crypto to crypto would be an auto like kind exchange thus not taxable until cashed out.And that probably means once you cash it from btc to usd on an exchange rather than transferring to B account.This leads to a next question,what's it mean for stablecoins?
368 2018-12-20 23:10:13 Wouldn't it be awesome to have an anonymous withdrawal system for crypto?

371 2018-12-20 23:10:03 I totally disagree with this article completely. The smaller tick size enables more ppl to transact (and be a part of crypto trading) and it’s the experience and expertise of seasoned traders that allows them to compete with algos. *Every real-trader knows algos aren’t the enemy.
372 2018-12-20 23:10:02 Sounds like if they can hang in there for six months they won’t need to reverse. If they get a crypto or enertec miracle in the next six months they won’t need to reverse. Maybe a sale of restaurants, Coolisys etc correct?

377 2018-12-20 23:09:44 Hi Andy . You inspire me in crypto for what you have accomplished. I’ve been dollar cost averaging into Xrp and ada and a few others . How much do I honestly need in your opinion to not have to be worrying as much about money. Not financial advice thank you
378 2018-12-20 23:09:42 Alts probably a little worse, so it looks like bch is back to its proper relative valuation

380 2018-12-20 23:09:19 TD/Bakkt is a bigger deal than most expect. There will be a pre pump/front run, this may be part of it.

381 2018-12-20 23:09:16 Can one short crypto on binance?
382 2018-12-20 23:09:07 again, my entire point of this thread is to highlight that the current state of the bill is in no way equipped to provide the regulatory clarity we seek for xrp

391 2018-12-20 23:07:48 Very interesting, was at a conference with top bankers from Nigeria last month and crypto was a hot topic. Some viewed it as evil, others thought they should look into it more. Level of knowledge on it was subpar. Also their government warned against investing in it recently.
392 2018-12-20 23:07:45 I’ve been pretty ‘heads down’ workin’ on Odin at @GoThorTech : ) ... but is this possibly a trend reversal in #crypto? Market showing some strength 
393 2018-12-20 23:07:37 BTC price lost 27% since the fork date, combined BCH price lost 33%.

445 2018-12-20 23:01:14 I liked blue initially too, but there’s a lot of blue logos in crypto, and it makes BSV look like an altcoin. While it’s a professional look, I feel like it implies a weaker posture than we should have about our role in bitcoin’s hierarchy and history.

458 2018-12-20 22:59:58 Crypto networks will continue to behave irrationally, until institutional capital will come in. Then we will see maturation of the markets. Until then, expect whales to pump/dump the markets.

485 2018-12-20 22:56:15 @MelissaLeeCNBC Great interview.  Good to keep pressing on the key issues on volume etc.  The question still remains, why bother with crypto at all unless someone is a criminal or trying to hide something.  You still can not carry it with you and it has no backing by anything.

494 2018-12-20 22:54:43 Halvening isn’t a “narrative”. It never has been. Half as many bitcoin are dumped daily on the market when the block reward decreases. It’s simple supply/demand economics.
495 2018-12-20 22:54:31 We have covered many of those on the show. However we have never done a panel on what it means in the now and people’s thoughts. I would def listen to it.

585 2018-12-20 22:42:53 Like if I'm asked to say the only thing left in my mouth; Crypto is giving a urge value with the present regulations, imagine what has happened in the last few months.

People now see it has the right assets because of attention been given to it my media.

588 2018-12-20 22:42:20 Making crypto price predictions at the start of the year is a total crapshoot. Almost everyone was badly wrong with their 2018 calls.

592 2018-12-20 22:41:51 *Whistles* Those're some serious allegations. But if this curbs some general abusive behavior from exchanges, then I'm okay with that.

604 2018-12-20 22:40:21 Kudos. You can label Peter Schiff a broken clock but he immediately called this bear market in February when everyone was still praising FANGs and called the crypto bubble at the hight of the mania when everyone was thinking about the color of their lambo

620 2018-12-20 22:39:30 Hmm
621 2018-12-20 22:39:00 Made $2,400 since Sunday on my #crypto swings.  Not worth it for the fact I have to listen to more of these #elliottwave retards again
622 2018-12-20 22:38:49 " and when i take it out.... theres more money !"
623 2018-12-20 22:38:47 Yes, but only intelligent ones which are not always many do see goods in the bear market.

But the adoption of crypto this year is great
624 2018-12-20 22:38:47 その点フランスはやはり優れていると感じます。

投票というアクション自体が顧客であるアピールになるという認識が浸透してないと感じます。候補者を当選させる為ではなく。

Last year spikes the price of some coins of which are all not meant to be, but this year; the Market is more mature and actual/deserving rates of the coin are regulated

692 2018-12-20 22:30:21 ガバナンスの仕組みが問題なんだと思います。
議員は票が得られなければ活動出来ません。
個人個人の政治家の思考ではなく、インセンティブ的に圧倒的多数の高齢者という投票者＝顧客がHash powerを抑えており、現政権は常に現状維持が好都合という変化しにくいデザイン。これが一番の問題ですね

He threw out at least 10 different scenarios, multiple times, with several possible targets on each chart. I understand he used diff techniques to do the charting, but he wasn't the 1st to call the top or bottom. Basically, he called out many possibilities, like others.
698 2018-12-20 22:29:00 I think Africa will be the place where full adoption truly spawns. As economic systems begin to flourish, integration with crypto will be easier on the continent than on further developed continents.

But no matter what way you choose. Weed, game or "chill" online will litterly, only slow down you learning curve and creative thinking.
707 2018-12-20 22:27:25 #1: Definitely invest in cryptos! 
Also: Apply yourself in all aspects of life. If you’re going to go to college have a plan. The world needs engineers, doctors, lawyers, and other people that make the world go ‘round. Maybe start a business. Make sure you have fun doing it all!

714 2018-12-20 22:26:33 Dude, the only bubbles in the past 10 years have been in gold and crypto, driven in large part by by ppl afraid of imaginary bubbles in stocks. Not every bear market is a bubble.

717 2018-12-20 22:26:23 Sure, if you’re looking for #shitcoins, I know a guy...

Bt I wdn’t have an interest if KR1 was out there buying shitcoins...nobody cares right now, in the midst of a crypto-collapse, bt KR1 team actually has an excellent inv’t process & portfolio.
718 2018-12-20 22:26:01 Focusing on other shitcoins? Coinbase had like a total of 4 coins listed until a few months ago. For an exchange, that’s pretty minimal. It’s also the main onboarding platform for most US residents to get into crypto. Wtf r u even talking about. You seem bitter bro. @swedenfork

870 2018-12-20 22:04:57 Thanks Crypto Invest Summit for the follow! I´m very pleased with it.
871 2018-12-20 22:04:30 Ya gotta believe when Smart money really starts flowing into Crypto XEM/NPXS project would be a major focus.  Most complete use case with an up and running complex transaction POS(XPOS) with f(X) growing as well as partnerships.  It seems the most sure long term bet.

882 2018-12-20 22:02:30 some institutional investment will roll in. Furthermore, countries such as Iran and Venezuela will be stepping up into the crypto scene.

888 2018-12-20 22:01:50 I personally think this is a ploy from a anti drone tech company. They must have some WICKED drones to down planes for 24hours. I could get that drone down if I had your budget. Get some radio professionals in to work out it’s communications and get it jammed!

978 2018-12-20 21:50:09 Crypto Currency seems to be pulling out of the bear market right as the patreon/paypal controversy started getting a lot of attention.  Coincidence? Probably, but worth keeping an eye on nonetheless.

981 2018-12-20 21:49:55 and I know the issue goes even down to the credit card companies, which at the moment you really can't get around without going to crypto. But I never hear about processors other than PayPal and Stripe

987 2018-12-20 21:47:27 What’s great is these public officials see how it all works. You know they own crypto, and are going to advocate for their personal wealth

Where it will be, who knows BUT if they continue to develope the way they have they definitely have a chance to be one of the top crypto’ at “somepoint” especially if they are able to

1009 2018-12-20 21:44:41 That's EXACTLY what "punching themselves in the face" would be. The best thing XRP has going for it, regardless of partnerships, is it's community. It's the strongest in all of crypto. If they took such an action, everyone would bail and their remaining tokens would be worth 0.00

1110 2018-12-20 21:32:30 I like it, though issue with using cycles is markets change. Crypto does not necessarily have positive drift as produces no cash flows and has whales constantly dumping rather than buying. Markets changed when quant shops joined the fray. May not see all time highs for ten years.
1111 2018-12-20 21:32:17 The mortgage is a promise to pay USD. You cannot pay with crypto directly. The conversion service is necessary. Even if/when banks begin to "accept Bitcoin" you will likely see them do the conversion for you. Use the services. You asked how you can help.
1112 2018-12-20 21:32:10 stocks really don't have much of a effect on BTC but if we start to actually see a large scale currency crisis and capital controls that is when we BTC take flow -- just like during the 2015-2016 CNY devalution

1132 2018-12-20 21:30:30 I have heard that narrative for years -- that crypto will pump when stocks dump, I am not sold on that being a 100% correlation, BTC could act like a high flying tech stock and tank even harder, or like most of it's existence operate outside of that system.

1136 2018-12-20 21:30:20 Yeah the volume is low but from what I am reading it is used to pay for stuff like meals and provisions. It will take time but arguably a crypto’s greatest use case would be to be able to buy a loaf of bread for someone in a country like Venezuela

1140 2018-12-20 21:30:11 Check $VET. No other crypto has such partnerships.

1144 2018-12-20 21:29:11 1- there is already a law in place that makes it mandatory. 
2- the ramp mentioned is a ramp to get into a converted van to transport her child.They are extremely expensive to convert, often costing more than the cost of a regular new minivan. (so think ~$60K for a van)

1148 2018-12-20 21:28:47 It's cute isn't it?

That king of bs gets a free pass on CT everyday when it's the brow guy getting attacked.

When it's the white OGs then everyone says "not cool man, this isn't right"

1150 2018-12-20 21:28:15 idk, I think central bank is a useful loose analogy (like digital gold for btc)

- it sets interest rates
- it prints/destroys currency
- it will likely drive debt costs in the wider crypto economy
1151 2018-12-20 21:28:14 soon people will get crypto money  by the hour to help kill the boss...the mix of gaming and blockchain  will be nuclear fusion...#EOS
1152 2018-12-20 21:28:07 i do agree with you, but stocks are kinda fucked all over the world, there is decent opportunity that someone pumps this market as a whole to attract attention as btc was created at the end of the 2008-09 recession.
we are not in a pretty common overall market structure.
1153 2018-12-20 21:27:45 We agree that crypto complies very well with TA but disagree with your reason. TA was developed many years ago, before government interference in the financial markets. Crypto is the closest we've had to completely free financial markets in a very long time.
1154 2018-12-20 21:27:44 XRP will be the first ETF crypto. Just my thoughts...
1155 2018-12-20 21:27:33 Taking a break from streaming / crypto-twitter / scalp-trading.

It's an addiction, want to spend time with friends and family.

Will be back after Christmas with new plans ;) 

Enjoy yourselves lads 
1156 2018-12-20 21:27:21 No mate I didn’t buy at all. Out for now.

1164 2018-12-20 21:25:56 Traded a few bounces of TRX
1165 2018-12-20 21:25:45 @realDonaldTrump make congress pass "Token Taxonomy Act". America doesnt want to miss the boat and be behind the rest of the world in crypto. XRP will make america dominate in crypto.

1177 2018-12-20 21:24:02 How is @VentureCoinist not on this list?
1178 2018-12-20 21:23:57 probably 12-18 months of sideways/rangebound, need to establish a base for the next bull trend. We don't just suddenly go from a 1 year bear trend into a raging bull trend, price structure doesn't work that way
1179 2018-12-20 21:23:47 If Starbucks were to sell *only its coffee* using crypto - how many TPS would they require?

1183 2018-12-20 21:22:25 El Congreso de EEUU va a tener la oportunidad de aprobar una propuesta para modificar el concepto legal de “valor” de forma que excluya a las criptodivisas.

Si lo hacen, se pueden convertir en un país más que atractivo para las crypto, si la fiscalidad acompaña.

1185 2018-12-20 21:22:19 As they should!! A crypto is not a currency. If the company goes out of business, will the crypto still trade? YES. Wake up ppl!!
1186 2018-12-20 21:21:51 Just when you think you've seen it all.
1187 2018-12-20 21:21:40 Yes, yes you should lol

1199 2018-12-20 21:19:55 people don't seem to understand that fundamentals can greatly improve yet we can still continue down for a long time -- AMZN made it's ATH in 1999 with the other dot coms it was way better fundamentally in 2006 but wasn't making new ATHs, needed to wait for 11 years for new ATH

U’re tweeting about #xrp more than the entire #xrpcommunity 
1209 2018-12-20 21:18:53 Yes, 2 things - I only want to raise crypto and I don’t want to register as a charity but I do want the money (!) to be guaranteed to go to a charity. So I guess, unless the charity has a wallet (which actually they should) then I need an intemediary to oversee.
1210 2018-12-20 21:18:50 Everyone: "wow crypto pumping like crazy"

1211 2018-12-20 21:18:48 We need a platform that uses smart contracts to tip content creators. Say I have a wallet where I deposit $10, the smart contract could convert the money and issue $0.01 for every hour of content I listen to automatically, you wouldn't even have to know it's using crypto

1215 2018-12-20 21:18:04 but the technicals in this case massively massively overshadowed anything fundamental related to these projects -- a broke parabolic trend is equivalent the fundamentals of winning the poker tourney on the Titanic, you are still going to end up at the bottom of the ocean

1227 2018-12-20 21:16:17 Can’t hedge a lot into unpredictability and extreme volatility... that’s not how these conservative minds work ... some will come but most will sit on their cash and wait for an opportunity backed by fundamentals. It’s as simple as that!
1228 2018-12-20 21:16:13 
1229 2018-12-20 21:15:57 From the low yeah

1273 2018-12-20 21:10:05 Guys it’s not because I called this temporary ride and gave exact targets, eg. my last tweets just before we took off that bear market is over! Bear is here for at least 6 months + if you can’t handle this just leave Crypto! If you are still alive hold on! $btc $xrp #crypto
1274 2018-12-20 21:09:59 I always feel bad for folks who have to spend extended time around a crypto hippie. They never have anything else to talk about.

1279 2018-12-20 21:09:29 I do agree with the zombie rally/zombie bounce -- feels like a lot of what 2014 was in BTC
1280 2018-12-20 21:09:17 RT @litecoin_bull: Maybe people can compare us to cliff high, I do not know the guy or what he does. We are using blockchain, and AI, & people were laughing at me, when I locked myself in room working. Its taken years for our bots to be programmed.

1285 2018-12-20 21:08:51 none of 'fundamentals' matter -- it is all market cycle related, the only thing that needed to be known was the broken parabolic trend back in Jan, the rest of was going to play out regardless if God himself came down and said you needed BTC to get into heaven

1287 2018-12-20 21:08:44 Whether we get a nice XMAS present from the crypto gods, or not. I am not worried. do not day trade crypto. Its a good way to lose money fast. 90% of these guys are failing, as I kept warning them, manipulation is still rife.

1299 2018-12-20 21:07:10 What I was alluding to is the exchanges have more "coins" traded than they actually hold. Same as derivatives in the Fiat system. Same as money printed, no longer backed by gold. The powers that be have used derivatives to rig the Crypto market in the same way they do for Fiat.

1313 2018-12-20 21:04:45 The reason I didn't take it is because I think the overall feeling is still on the bearish side. I personally would like to get some more confirmation of trend change before I enter. Can't argue with you being right about it bouncing :)

1320 2018-12-20 21:03:56 It doesn’t. Good for crypto overall, but doesn’t answer any of the questions in the current lawsuits against Ripple.

1366 2018-12-20 20:58:55 I believe this or similar language will be interpreted as the asset XRP will not be construed as a share or security interest in Ripple the company. They go IPO, then shares are introduced to the public.

1378 2018-12-20 20:57:31 Can you short without leverage and not have a liquidation number like with longs you can hold them as long as you want.
1379 2018-12-20 20:57:30 “They” can’t crash crypto via smear campaigns and influence of public persuasion alone. 

“They” are also likely afraid of integrating into crypto with their own instruments (as done before with credit-cards) as this will have unsavory secondary effects.

1419 2018-12-20 20:52:39 Nice, I think the crypto world may be waking up. You just simply can't sleep on ETN One of the Top Crypto Currencies for sure.
1420 2018-12-20 20:52:29 This is just not right, he has been outstanding from day not one bad dish and you take him out for an average dish when some of the finalists have made many mistakes sub average dishes. @masterchef you guys got it so wrong and really not impressed sounds fixed to me
1421 2018-12-20 20:52:27 Mine would be like: 

Hi, my name is Kyle. I often get woken up in the morning before my alarm goes off, thinking about crypto moves I could make / trying to figure out why my latest masternode isn't working, etc
1422 2018-12-20 20:52:18 And pondered over the fields and dry land appeared as before. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum
1423 2018-12-20 20:51:51 BTCZ is going up!!! Long the crypto and short the wall street bankers!
1424 2018-12-20 20:51:45 I’d give all enlisted a minimum 30% raise, officer pay would need to be looked at a bit better but most enlisted with families qualify for the SNAP program when they’re deployed. Probably closer to 50%

The VA and disabled vet programs would be audited. Aggressively.
1425 2018-12-20 20:51:39 Kijk aan, de crypto gaat weer in een tijd in de groene cijfers dus het AD komt zoals altijd weer met negatief nieuws. Zucht. Enneuh, hold on for dear life? Duidelijk weinig kennis van crypto.
1426 2018-12-20 20:51:34 I think old material could remain but total running time would have to be doubled to allow for addition of a section where the schoolkid explains crypto to members of Congress.
1427 2018-12-20 20:51:21 Cool idea. A solution still needs to be built for the fiat to crypto #Otc space. Scams are still rife, unfortunately. Traditional law firms and escrow venues are too inexperienced in crypto and blockchain to facilitate larger deals.
1428 2018-12-20 20:51:08 Crypto noobs fomo into anything they dont assess the lack of intrinsic value in crypto they mainly like all crypto and will buy on news.
1429 2018-12-20 20:50:56 Plenty of veterans on crypto twitter recommending to short your $BTC and $alts. Make sure you trade with no regrets...

1454 2018-12-20 20:48:06 As long as the whole #Crypto market keeps blindly following #bitcoin we are still in crypto winter.

Bitcoin is still a speculative asset only, there is no sustainable demand and will crash again, sooner or later.

Time for #eos to break free.
1455 2018-12-20 20:48:04 Instead of starting a paid group, I'll  start a Crypto Addiction Support Group where we all hold hands and clap for eachother.

1463 2018-12-20 20:47:10 I have to chime in here. They are already the Apple of crypto. 

Giving old things to people, marketing it as new, and screwing you on the price.

Apple have not invented a goddamn thing. They release "innovation" 3 years after everyone else. So yeh they are AOL too.

1477 2018-12-20 20:44:44 Well we rebranded long before the exploit fixes, so that's incorrect, and secondly we never agreed to their terms ever, I was only ever added to their Discord chan, CB is garabage and everyone knows it, I will always stand my ground and will always talk bad about them. Scammers.
1478 2018-12-20 20:44:43 Market's too small for any real forecast., considering the ease at which the market can be manipulated. Real forecasting won't be fruitful until we see a Trillion dollar market cap!

1480 2018-12-20 20:44:39 even a sh*t company like OSTK went to $80 during the crypto craze...and their CEO is beyond bonkers...

1496 2018-12-20 20:42:42 Crypto is the partial answer. Crypto only crowdfunding sites already exist but lack the required critical mass to take of so far. Crowdfunding that supports crypto+'legacy' funding is the holy grail at the moment imo.
1497 2018-12-20 20:42:39 cookies or consequences cj
1498 2018-12-20 20:42:39 後付けです！
1499 2018-12-20 20:42:34 And you're right.  

But if you poked around, you'd find more involvement than you might expect e.g. adult sites have accepted BTC payments for long while, some have invested in crypto-infrastructure projects, other things that may reduce storage/bandwidth costs, etc.
1500 2018-12-20 20:42:24 It is

1504 2018-12-20 20:42:00 I don't know what you have against Cardano but as a person in the Crypto space that people listen to you should be embracing projects with potential, not trying to shoot them down. Maybe ADA will be better then EOS, maybe it won't, but when you talk shit you hurt the entire space
1505 2018-12-20 20:41:40 well now I am back just wanted to say its very nice to see our  UK HMRC have put some official infomation on their website regarding taxes and crypto.. me thinks crypto is going nowhere :)

1543 2018-12-20 20:37:50 Gold finally starting to break out. Very few people in the traditional markets are flowing into crypto. And that's even if they know how to purchase it. We're a long way away from crypto being a safe haven

1548 2018-12-20 20:37:27 To summarize, crypto will enable scale and transparency reducing the frequency of bank runs. However, when that fails coordination and cooperation becomes paramount to extend liquidity where needed. Hopefully @AragonProject has governance nailed by then :)

1559 2018-12-20 20:35:49 I would consider Bloomberg predictions, on Equity and Crypto market always way off, and always in perfect “timing” to affect the Crypto Assets price with the “banks-friendly” news.
1560 2018-12-20 20:35:41 he is not goldfish but  a idiot fish. No sense whatever he is talking in TG.  Common sense,  owner of a coin worth 1$ worth will not sell it for less than a cent #digscam #dig
1561 2018-12-20 20:35:38 FB honestly has a better story around E2E crypto than almost anyone else. Only maybe the walled garden of iMessage has been more consistent, but with that I still think you can't see long term keys and have to trust Apple. Oh and China iCloud... Yeahhh....
1562 2018-12-20 20:35:35 Funny, the stock market guys always make fun of crypto traders when we take losses. Most times we take it in stride & chuckle along with them. However, when the tables are reversed those dudes get salty! 

Looks like the stock market is heading the way of crypto.
1563 2018-12-20 20:35:24 Not a theory, no market climb forever, there are always a major retracing... Happen for the last 150 years in the market cycle

1569 2018-12-20 20:34:39 @JedMcCaleb Dear Jed, as part of my Masters Thesis. I would like to request your help & support in my research topic:”Blockchain - Crypto as a viable solution for Global Payments”. Would be waiting for your reply.

1572 2018-12-20 20:34:30 1b) Crypto will lead to the largest transnational "banks" the world has ever seen.
How do we know scale leads to resilience? Analyzing the frequency and severity of bank failures in the US (small unit banks) vs. Canada/Europe (large  branch banks) over the last 150 years.
1573 2018-12-20 20:34:23 I can understand this though. Even mega extroverts need a moment

1610 2018-12-20 20:30:45 I believe this area has always been ambiguous, opening loopholes for capitals gains tax or income tax avoidance so now they're noticing that crypto assets are here to stay so they take measures. This doesn't apply to security nor utility tokens btw.

1620 2018-12-20 20:30:09 Everyone who thinks crypto is tough, you should try building a global business from scratch.

1630 2018-12-20 20:29:31 I think that is where crypto can really shine. Not sure of the mechanics of it though and how they will buy and sell crypto, most lean to their banks?

1634 2018-12-20 20:28:54 SEC can have it's opinion on crypto; Congress can amend the laws relating to crypto.

Bill was drafted by one Republican (@WarrenDavidson) & one Democrat (@RepDarrenSoto), so bipartisanship is in effect.

New Congress in January, both were reelected.

May see reintroduced in 2019

1657 2018-12-20 20:27:19 I would but what I really really want to see is the ability to deposit BTC/LTC into the cash app from an external wallet.  In this way I could use my cash app debit card to spend my crypto in a fiat world.

1672 2018-12-20 20:24:51 Too bad Canadian credit cards have blocked crypto. Only a few banks still allow it.
1673 2018-12-20 20:24:48 I have to say, that was a really efficient trigger right there 

Sad part is, we also know he has no idea what he's doing, and the moment we point it out he's going to react that way, making us the attackers and he the victim.

Most predictable behavior in all CT.

1693 2018-12-20 20:23:16 うーん、自分とは考え方が逆ですね。トレンドはサイクルによって周期的なものと捉えてて、インパルスでもダイアゴナルでも推進5波が終わったら修正3波に移行すると思ってるので。Google、Apple、Amazonがいい例

1698 2018-12-20 20:22:39 Yes. It’s when the prices start going up tricking people into thinking it’s going to keep going but it crashes back down.

1702 2018-12-20 20:21:43 I used to do some work for Sport England. Don't remember going to any sports facilities funded by crypto currency!
1703 2018-12-20 20:21:37 Buying Bitcoin 
1704 2018-12-20 20:21:32 so the average tether holder made 3.5 trades in the last 24hrs.  Makes sense, crypto traders are manic and tether isn't meant to be held long term, its just a parking spot between trades
1705 2018-12-20 20:21:27 I am still in school, fortunately my last year.
It would have been 1000x better if I just started working.
1706 2018-12-20 20:21:20 I think he still looks at it like it's a stock.

1708 2018-12-20 20:21:15 Ben sattim direk :)
1709 2018-12-20 20:21:09 It’s Fear of Missing Out. When people see the prices rising and starting buying that is FOMO.
1710 2018-12-20 20:21:03 You are absolutely right Rob but I wonder in the US if many people don't take profits along the way with their crypto because of our harsh tax consequences?That may be changing but there are time that I didn't because it wasn't worth the hassle & disclosing I even had crypto yet.
1711 2018-12-20 20:20:59 They are teaching about mining by giving away a crypto you can't even mine. What?
1712 2018-12-20 20:20:57 They're all part of the same team
1713 2018-12-20 20:20:50 I don't agree they are threats. Quantum safe crypto algorithms is a solved problem, and quantum comms will be an amazing security improvement over those anyway. AI isn't a threat - it would just be exposing existing vulns that shouldn't be there in the first place.

1716 2018-12-20 20:20:26 Kids, don’t confuse “school” with “education”. Relying on the former will most certainly hold you back, but a lack of the latter will ensure a life of mediocrity. Never stop learning.

1736 2018-12-20 20:18:00 There totally is! This is less about that and more about how this is the 3rd article by the same author that has had very basic facts wrong about crypto regulation/legislation. It detracts from the credibility of the article.

1744 2018-12-20 20:17:24 thanks @CryptoMento  for this tweet, got my attention and testing that indicator as well now - simply AMAZING @CryptoNTez !!
1745 2018-12-20 20:17:20 I've been in support jobs my whole life and was excited to get my first crypto related position because I thought I would finally be dealing with a higher caliber of individual

Nope, now I get to explain quantum mechanics to someone who didnt pass 3rd grade while being yelled at
1746 2018-12-20 20:17:19 like, if shipping the private messages off to some api to be hoovered up for advertisers is happening, then it sorta doesnt matter if theres crypto involved because there are mechanisms that are just sidestepping it anyway.
1747 2018-12-20 20:17:15 I never left?
1748 2018-12-20 20:17:14 Yes is it crypto related also?
1749 2018-12-20 20:16:43 and then on top of that there's the whole permissions surface and hairball of a discussion surrounding the messenger app itself and what its capabilities are on any given phone platform.. so while there is totally crypto it seems .. circumventable?

1764 2018-12-20 20:15:39 To all my active friends in crypto, congratulations on such a successful 2018! Now you can proudly said you survived "a bear market".

1766 2018-12-20 20:15:17 We embrace gender equality and diversity, but we need to know if you're living in a sanctioned country, if you're over 18, and we can add a "rather not say" in the gender options, but we will still know about gender from your KYC that we ask to filter out scammers.
1767 2018-12-20 20:15:10 This just gives me hope (that I didn't have before) that the US is at least interested in not being in last place in the crypto race. They'd be stupid not to create an environment that encourages this technology to be developed and housed in the states.

1774 2018-12-20 20:14:11 How much you want to bet that Jay Clayton (SEC Chair) gets replaced early next year now that Mick Mulvaney is Trump's Chief of Staff? And this new bill passes? Crypto-friendly environment for USA in 2019 or lose the race.  Trump has been briefed.

1784 2018-12-20 20:12:46 I've been following you because much of what say about crypto is true and often amusing, if a bit over the top sometimes, but, again, this isn't universally true. Holo had a great 2018, and I think will have an even better 2019. Also, it requires no wasteful mining :)
1785 2018-12-20 20:12:40 #xrpthestandard #xrp #ripple has clearly got great fundamentals that will shine in the next run. Damn, in a year full of losers it's been great and shown independence. Addresses, shemeshesses. Meh

1787 2018-12-20 20:12:23 Bet at least six of those die in some horrible virus on some alien planet. Only reason for cross contamination of other copies, is because you’d loaded six of them into bodies to have an orgy with yourself.

1805 2018-12-20 20:10:22 I’ve never been more bullish on crypto. The people that can’t see how this is going to change everything we know about money and trust are the same ones that are ignorant about everything else. Myopic views will literally kill them.

1810 2018-12-20 20:10:12 That is correct, that's why i say that chart analysis in crypto doesn't help so much, specially with xrp because there's utility now and multiple factors.
1811 2018-12-20 20:10:11 So hollywood movies are real huh?!!

1813 2018-12-20 20:09:54 Yes sir, you really can’t make this stuff up. 2000 alts are the exact opposite of what’s good for bitcoin or even crypto for that matter. This is not an opinion. Falls under a fact.

1828 2018-12-20 20:08:49 CRYPTO mass adoption here we come.
1829 2018-12-20 20:08:47 Censorship is bad and everything, but crypto is the easy and obvious solution to the @patreon debacle

1834 2018-12-20 20:08:17 I was buying stocks and etfs and kept seeing ad after ad about bitcoin and crypto.  Finally decided to do some research and then I was hooked.
1835 2018-12-20 20:08:10 You'll receive an official announcement shortly
1836 2018-12-20 20:07:49 Your timeline is full of the dumbest comments I’ve read. #footprint Check yourself 
1837 2018-12-20 20:07:48 @newton_crypto thanks for the follow, Newton & have a great Thursday! Would love to know what you're working on right now?
1838 2018-12-20 20:07:27 traditional markets tanking and crypto rising. DOES IT SMELL LIKE DECORRELATION OR WHAT
1839 2018-12-20 20:07:21 Now return #bitcoin to "like-kind" status while we are at it.  Real property is included under Section 1031 of the IRS code. #Bitcoin and #altcoins were removed from this status on January 1st 2018.  Bitcoin is real digital property.  #regtech #Crypto #blockchain
1840 2018-12-20 20:07:16 Ross, you gave the first impulse to bitcoin use as currency. I believe you right now look the crypto with complety different point of view with your experience. Thanku you man for being part of all this! Respect

1842 2018-12-20 20:07:08 Unbelievable that the number 2 crypto currency is not traded on Coinbase. Might I suggest buyers use Uphold or some other site.
1843 2018-12-20 20:07:00 CBC is a reccomend subscribe for your crypto news. He works hard and is very interactive with his viewers. 
1844 2018-12-20 20:06:58 Wtf bully....
1845 2018-12-20 20:06:56 “The fox loses his hair but not his habits” he’s just masking his real self. I know he’s part of your group but too many just ignore/allow & accept trash because “this is crypto”.
1846 2018-12-20 20:06:49 Anger dissapointment and fear

1859 2018-12-20 20:05:36 XRapid adds only a false speculative or intrinsic value to holding XRP. It’s a centralized bank coin. You are missing the entire point of crypto. It states this in the white paper plainly in English. So shill on but just remember last year. All hype.
1860 2018-12-20 20:05:31 Keep doing what you love and you will be fine! And help others make sense of the crypto world

1895 2018-12-20 20:01:20 Before crypto 14% from an trade was hella sexy! Crypro profit margins in these early days can really skew how you look at returns. That said if you play crypto right 14% can look alittle underwhelming.

1908 2018-12-20 19:59:53 It's acceptance despite immaturity is what makes it truly exceptional. Once people know they can transfer goods/services/value without governments, banks or bags of gold... Then crypto is mainstream and highly valued.

1910 2018-12-20 19:59:41 @peqsereio oh you’re suddenly a victim now? You’re the one who decided race was an important factor in your initial tweet. Any idea why that is? Following my simple question you seem to be triggered as fuck.
1911 2018-12-20 19:59:33 I think it depends on the personality types. I’m in the same boat as you, I didn’t fit the cookie cutter mold of being taught the same thing, the same way as everyone else

1924 2018-12-20 19:58:45 These terms have been found to cause knee-jerk reactions in the general public. It's best to not use them.

What works best to convince the general public of the benefits of rejuvenation:

- talk to them individually
- stress the health benefits
1925 2018-12-20 19:58:38 Indeed he’s provided a great framework for thinking about base money with focus and clarity.

Terms like 'living forever' and 'immortality' are religious terms.

1953 2018-12-20 19:56:22 Only smart people should do this. Because if you’re smart and have some aspirations in life you won’t get stuck on the smoking weed and chill part. This isn’t something lazy people should do.
1954 2018-12-20 19:56:14 Every time crypto pops a bit for no reason reminds of vitaliks tweet whether we *earned* it
1955 2018-12-20 19:56:12 That's not how it works. Current attempts at finding rejuvenation are all about fixing damage, accepting that our metabolism will go on to cause more damage, then fixing it again.

There are zero people interested in reprogramming our dna to remove aging.

1977 2018-12-20 19:54:01 I hope it will be what we expect it to be.
1978 2018-12-20 19:54:00 Love @restartenergyio I was wondering when you can list the updates on #DeltaDirect on @get_delta

1983 2018-12-20 19:53:33 Well, crypto is worse than "traditional" (centralized) systems in all respects, including those.  That is the heavy price of its only goal, "be decentralized".  And in the end it did not even achieve that goal...

2013 2018-12-20 19:50:29 Was it you Koroush talking about 50% crypto and 50% fiat and constantly rebalancing? How about the same principe applied to ABC and SV during these hashwars?
2014 2018-12-20 19:50:28 It does but it’s a good thing too. 

The slate... it needs wiping clean from time to time. Because we are human and greedy twats in times of plenty.

2025 2018-12-20 19:49:21 Another bright side of bear market is that some exchanges & major crypto firms have started to use their outreach to educate more people about cryptocurrencies. If the educational material is not designed properly it may backfire and bring more speculators to the space. @Bitcoin

2027 2018-12-20 19:49:05 When the crypto personalities want you to debate with them on live stream when they have 2  years on trading experience and your sitting at 20. Rationalizing other peoples perspectives probably helps when trading too right helps cleans bias too but they avoid things that hurt ego
2028 2018-12-20 19:49:01 STOCKS;  tariffs, trade wars, geo-political problems from a divided     international community caused by trump's attacks resulted in global     decline in world wealth:  
China stocks - down 22%   
Europe - down 18%

USA - down 8%

2030 2018-12-20 19:48:38 This time last year the crypto market was on one of the biggest declines its seen in terms of value. This year it's on a bullish pattern  I wonder what 2019 had to offer crypto
2031 2018-12-20 19:48:31 If #crypto is dead, why is $STRAT up 30% today? Why is $OMG up nearly 20%? $DASH up 20%? The problem with making definitive statements is when reality doesn’t match up w/ your POV you become untrustworthy real quick...
2032 2018-12-20 19:48:29 Always wise to have #Bitcoin in one’s #crypto portfolio
2033 2018-12-20 19:48:25 The bubble already popped and the "crash" is over. Lots of catalysts upcoming including Nasdaq 2.0 futures, ETF and increased institutional investors. I sincerely encourage you to have an open mind, as the crypto valuations are now reasonable. Lots of money to be made in 2019.
2034 2018-12-20 19:48:24 Didn't get there during my trip, to my great shame

2036 2018-12-20 19:48:18 Money flowing into crypto.
2037 2018-12-20 19:48:16 I learned recently there's no point in arguing w fools. Arguments become emotional & pride-driven instead of logical. 

Coinbase is Silicon Valley's crypto play. Once broader bear market is internalized by SV + recession hits will be tougher to raise money to cover up problems.
2038 2018-12-20 19:48:15 Lmao!
2039 2018-12-20 19:48:14 I know man! This is a crime against crypto imo.
2040 2018-12-20 19:48:04 A very interesting idea! I'm sure it will be in great demand! I am sure that everything will work out as the project is very big and comfortable!

2117 2018-12-20 19:40:39 Why does the penis look like George Washington???
2118 2018-12-20 19:40:28 Crypto macht gerade spass
2119 2018-12-20 19:40:27 I blaze  , hit the gym,  run 3 miles , eat healthy,  hold a full time job with overtime,  pay all my bills,  take care of family,  and stay creative....its all about productivity ..cannabis making you lazy is just an excuse imo
2120 2018-12-20 19:40:22 Ikr? Ever since I joined twitter and started interacting with ppl here, I find ppl irl dull AF
2121 2018-12-20 19:40:21 Real
2122 2018-12-20 19:40:10 Friends and relations had done so neatly. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum
2123 2018-12-20 19:39:51 yes, exactly
2124 2018-12-20 19:39:51 I don't care about the ramifications.
2125 2018-12-20 19:39:51 It’s coming. No doubt about that. How about that tattoo? Maybe a W on eech of your bum cheeks? Then you only have to fart to comment on the crypto no.1! WOW
2126 2018-12-20 19:39:47 Yeah, right, cos I'm like afraid of crocodiles, right, so I'm going to make friends with a load of crypto-Stalinist fuckin hyenas. Stroll on, clueless.
2127 2018-12-20 19:39:36 I have that... but I also have a huge dysfunctional family that I love a lot and that I don’t want to lose... you just adapt to your circumstances
2128 2018-12-20 19:39:35 Apparently we have to step our game up. 
2129 2018-12-20 19:39:30 Oh Joy... Trying to move some crypto off my @Trezor applied the recommended firmware update and now bricked #trezor.... Merry Christmas guess wont' be giving out BTC for Christmas this year.
2130 2018-12-20 19:39:24 iv had a call with @winternomics as well and after 40 minutes of mostly him talking and dropping knowledge bombs, I was speechless he is the true master ! Value is a scarcity 
2131 2018-12-20 19:39:17 glad I'm not the only one
2132 2018-12-20 19:39:14 This year treated me good , made alittle over a thousand in profits on crypto , considering the market is down 80% from when I started , I consider that good
2133 2018-12-20 19:39:13 LOL, the standard
2134 2018-12-20 19:39:07 i can respect that

but could be a hinderance!
2135 2018-12-20 19:38:57 It was a mistake saying to smoke weed but I think most people know that too
2136 2018-12-20 19:38:56 Anyone say crypto? Haha
2137 2018-12-20 19:38:38 Most miners I know don’t use GAAP accounting so depreciation isn’t a make or break.  Cash method more critical for them as equipment cost is sunk cost.
2138 2018-12-20 19:38:37 It’s fine... do you have any good alt account ideas? Let me know... I’m not some sort of BMS gene nazi, unlike the rest of them... And I’d quite like to know it was you... you know... after the shame of this conversation has caused you to delete this account.
2139 2018-12-20 19:38:35 Scamから本物になったものこそ信用できるんだよなぁwwww
2140 2018-12-20 19:38:31 I found it interesting that the test gives you your perfect personality match too
2141 2018-12-20 19:38:30 They should also exempt gains on crypto donated for charitable causes.
2142 2018-12-20 19:38:28 yea

but you have money and independence 

(which was a point i was getting at in one of my posts)
2143 2018-12-20 19:38:27 It is
2144 2018-12-20 19:38:24 Dear @elonmusk someone predicts like this, can we send crypto to Mars, since you are the only and both expert with Paypal and SpaceX
2145 2018-12-20 19:38:09 Thank you!
2146 2018-12-20 19:38:08 Real recognise real 
2147 2018-12-20 19:38:07 Would be awesome if you had some dynamics in your reviews... It's kinda one dimensional reading pessimistic news from you guys all the time.
2148 2018-12-20 19:38:00 Largely symbolic bill for this year.  Setting stage for next House 2019.  Discussion late winter.  Pass bill in Spring.  Crypto explosion.
2149 2018-12-20 19:37:48 Unfortunately the system can be so hard to deal with sometimes. It's really heartwarming to read the pro's this woman writes. This kid is lucky to have such a great mum!
2150 2018-12-20 19:37:43 Yep. And dealing with patients means faking the extroverted AND the Assertive... it truly drains me, but I adapted well. I can’t wait to get home and be alone with my computer tho
2151 2018-12-20 19:37:41 Maybe not inversely related, but at least crypto is capable of moving independent from stocks.
2152 2018-12-20 19:37:40 How did you do it?
2153 2018-12-20 19:37:37 My now retired mother was a remedial teacher and worked with kids on all kinds of spectrums and it was so rewarding for her. She always told us great stories about her work and what had happened that day and how impressed she was with the kids.
2154 2018-12-20 19:37:33 This post just summed up my entire crypto lifespan
2155 2018-12-20 19:37:24 what's happen in the crypto market is no news but if you don't buy the dip, the price is about to sky rocket again
2156 2018-12-20 19:37:19 this 100%

need to be as truthful and raw as possible

i sometimes find answering each question as quickly as possible results in a more truthful response, since you are often just going w your gut and don't have time to overthink
2157 2018-12-20 19:37:13 I generated 1500% off my investment in crypto. Will be buying $50,000 more next week. Let's see if LPTX or my cyrpto investments do better in 2019 ;)

2170 2018-12-20 19:36:12 I don’t adapt to others. I adapt to the situation that fits me the best and let’s me achieve my goals
2171 2018-12-20 19:36:11 @mappopk_crypto bravo aelf
2172 2018-12-20 19:36:07 Of for fecks sakes
2173 2018-12-20 19:36:05 Same Q. My default is introvert, but I usually test as ENTP. (I think) I’m good at faking being an extrovert because of being forced into interactions with strangers daily.

2176 2018-12-20 19:35:56 I couldnt buy cryptos from @coinbase today. I call them and they say I’m ineligible for buying crypto from them ever again. They won’t even review my account. I’ve always had the funds to buy, bought thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of cryptos since 2017.

2186 2018-12-20 19:34:58 Fuck that.

I never adapted to others and I'm glad of it.

2188 2018-12-20 19:34:49 True. My sister thrives in a crowd. Yet she is shy. But she gets her energy from being surrounded by ppl. We are the absolute opposite
2189 2018-12-20 19:34:42 WTF?  Lol.  Once again  i see  that nobody  in the crypto  world  has any idea about it!!!

2194 2018-12-20 19:34:16 Fair enough. I gave up adapting socially when I was 14, then again I am not naturally shy so perhaps that has helped.

2210 2018-12-20 19:32:56 
2211 2018-12-20 19:32:51 You can also lie to yourself while taking the test and get a result that is not accurate, but a reflection of who you aspire to be. I would say...

2229 2018-12-20 19:31:53 Exactly! I was surprised the test nailed me. But when I showed it to those around me... even family, they said they didn’t recognize me in my result. I think since it’s us doing it it’s more accurate to our true self. I tried to go for the first thing that came to my head

2258 2018-12-20 19:28:58 First don't try to find confluence among crypto-twitter traders to enter a trade.

Second make sure you have a plan (YOUR OWN) to manage risk if it goes south so you don't bust, every trade is a risk and anybody selling it like a 'sure thing' is a scammer.

Goodluck!
2259 2018-12-20 19:28:58 In unsafe times Bitcoins and all crypto currencies are rising. Don’t trust Fiat money in time of collapse economy.

2261 2018-12-20 19:28:54 Such a great article thanks for posting what are your thoughts on what the DITN digital identity network is doing in this space? They are looking into securing multi platform data distribution by the user with Biometrics it appears it could also verify all entry’s in crypto

2275 2018-12-20 19:27:37 Yes, ever since I was a little girl. I am sooo good at faking it that everyone thinks I’m an extrovert until they get to know me well. It’s a good think to learn. I had to learn to be assertive too, even though my first instinct is turbulence

2292 2018-12-20 19:25:50 It’s the only way to be successful in my field. But I only feel myself when I’m alone. Growing up in a huge dysfunctional family, it was the only way to survive to learn to fake it tho
2293 2018-12-20 19:25:49 There is a correlation between this crypto pump and the dollar crashing hard over the past few days .

2294 2018-12-20 19:25:39 To clarify my post.. One of the Events is only limited to happen this Friday.. and this may very well be Legendary.

2295 2018-12-20 19:25:38 This could go similarly to Japan: defining crypto in it's own class.Did they call it a "crypto-asset"?

Good moves. Exciting times.
2296 2018-12-20 19:25:27 is that something you had to develop over time?

i'm decent at faking it (sociability and extroversion)  in public. if drinking, i am a pro

2329 2018-12-20 19:23:21 Same. Yet I do extremely well in public. I can even give a conference with extreme confidence and small talk for hours, fake the extrovert. But when I get home I am drained and sad and exhausted and I need some alone time
2330 2018-12-20 19:23:18 your argument that since the government currently overseas the funding of roads that there is no other way it could be accomplished is naive and ignorant. Same argument the fools in the UK have regarding healthcare and the NHS.

2349 2018-12-20 19:21:35 I believe XRP will overtake BTC for the #1 spot in 2019.  Part of the reason why BTC hit 20k is because of the base pairs to other crypto.  XRP use case is growing and has the most adoption.  BTC will always be #2 and they may even battle for #1 again as layers are built on top.

2357 2018-12-20 19:21:05 It harms innovation. The key thing the SEC is against is one of the most important things in all of crypto, replacing the government. I used to have to edit white papers to take out features. It is absurd. SEC opposes all decentralization in essence, just doesn't fit, never will.

we will see alot volatility

2369 2018-12-20 19:20:13 People need to wake up and realize the media's view the market sleaus goes up and we should buy no matter what does not describe reality.  Elliott waves do.  Top was October.  Heading to 2009 lows. People should sell all stocks, short market and by crypto and silver.  Truth

2402 2018-12-20 19:15:49 uhhhhh but its neither. Certainly not more 'magical' than, "we will just let the government do it. They will surely do it best"
2403 2018-12-20 19:15:43 You're still a scammer to the crypto community.
2404 2018-12-20 19:15:27 All in crypto!
2405 2018-12-20 19:15:13 Long on CRYPTO...short on anything valuable. Hey Braintrust...CRYPTO MEANS DEATH
2406 2018-12-20 19:14:52 Isn't that a small percent increase compared to what crypto has done the past day?
2407 2018-12-20 19:14:39 Perhaps. Local businesses and communities pool together money for things all the time. Whether local home owner associations or other orgs.

What about them? Why should anyone else have to pay for some isolated communities roads other than themselves?

2423 2018-12-20 19:12:53 This makes no sense.  The SEC has nothing to do with taxation, nor does it have the authority to do so.
2424 2018-12-20 19:12:46 Hah. Love it. Love crypto
2425 2018-12-20 19:12:35 HOLY SHIT THAT IS SO FUCKING BULLISH SIR!!!

2431 2018-12-20 19:11:46 Always check the short charts first. If you saw how much shorts were piling you would have closed them. Super obvious squeeze even when TA was bearish
2432 2018-12-20 19:11:44 Blockchain replaces @WesternUnion the banks & the Governments. Blockchain is trustless. Anyone today can download a Crypto wallet for free & start using Crypto P2P without middle men, high fees or censorship.
2433 2018-12-20 19:11:42 So joe smo can afford to pave the road all by himself? Also what about isolated small communities just have them pay for miles of road?
2434 2018-12-20 19:11:40 Well not true the border they are jumping in hundreds a day right in front of border security seems good ole ACLU is helping them sue us to stay
2435 2018-12-20 19:11:40 Das wird jetzt sehr schnell, sehr blutig.
2436 2018-12-20 19:11:06 The thing is, merchants will  want Crypto transactions because they have lower fees.  The problem now is that people like me won't spend crypto because I don't want a mountain of tax paperwork for capital gains on $5 purchases.

2438 2018-12-20 19:10:35 I agree with the spirit of this advice, if youre good at art or landscaping or cooking or you really love fashion, go do that... Not everyone has to be an accountant or an engineer.
2439 2018-12-20 19:10:29 report back
2440 2018-12-20 19:10:23 Should be aired later tonight. And for good order, this is about a drone project with #Factom that is rather on top of mind with the #GatwickDrones situation. Could not pass to make some bad jokes for my crypto friends ;)

2447 2018-12-20 19:09:56 Access to a wide network of people, to the proprietary streams of info therefrom, and to the opportunities therein. I think you're world class at this!

My view could be highly skewed by industry/location though (crypto + Asia)
2448 2018-12-20 19:09:44 Not trying to discourage you :). I'd say I agree, except in the case of people thinking that they were safe using all of this (e.g. for crypto purposes), but being mistaken, because they don't understand what you do. Think: someone who just adds the crate w/o reading README

2450 2018-12-20 19:09:32 I estimate that IDEX collected ~$3.4 million in trading fees in 2018. I pulled trading volume for the decentralized #crypto exchange YTD. IDEX charges 10bps for maker and 20bps for taker. I assumed 15bps (mid-point) for each trade tacked onto both sides.  Not bad revenue
2451 2018-12-20 19:09:32 There are some absolute psychopaths in crypto. Straight up thieving, cutthroat, crazy people.

2460 2018-12-20 19:08:20 If crypto (10 years old) can get the SEC to amend the Securities Exchange Act and definition of what a security is (72 year old law), crypto can do anything. Let’s gooooo

2551 2018-12-20 18:59:04 They are doing a lot of good things to bring crypto into the public eye
2552 2018-12-20 18:59:00 My count differs. My count has this as wave A .

2554 2018-12-20 18:58:58 We didn't seen $alts dying,people crying $BTC going to Zero, XRP going to $0, big changes in Top 10 Coins so I don't fill we seen bottom.!! All previous bottoms killed crypto totally I can still don't see any sign that all previous bottoms have so I think we should wait for $BTC
2555 2018-12-20 18:58:51 The downward trend that some crypto currencies go through is really a great opportunity to invest and see that what good projects are established with solid bases can capitalize a new and improved marketplace.
2556 2018-12-20 18:58:43 any many will change their tune if infrastructure begins to crumble. Individuals and corporations are incentivized to have decent infrastructure around their place of business and homes.
2557 2018-12-20 18:58:32 funny in the states newyork pizza is the best kind. just don't get all those ingredients on it. i don't get supreme pizza, it sucks. and plus it doesn't cook right when you cover the cheese heavily. it's gotta have little toppings on to cook properly

2567 2018-12-20 18:57:32 I think people in crypto (investors, founder et all) should spend time doing pre mortem analysis now for 2019 and beyond.
2568 2018-12-20 18:57:31 Definitely agree. Buying ETH is a major bet on "crypto" surviving. I think there is "blood in the streets", though. It comes down to how close you think the bottom is. Whenever I decide to "wait another day for cheaper", I usually get screwed.

2585 2018-12-20 18:55:30 Then who else did?
2586 2018-12-20 18:55:26 Maybe we are lucky and the tuition system will be overrun and one day settled in CMPCO. Cheaper, faster, absolutely free, transparent and without interest.
2587 2018-12-20 18:55:12 Lol that's why it will fail because many will have this thought in a city dude
2588 2018-12-20 18:55:11 Thanks for responding so quickly I’m assuming it should at least retest 3000 again being the 5th.
2589 2018-12-20 18:55:07 It was crap as well, way to much shit on it.Never ordering from newyorkpizza again. 45 min, cold, looks like shit and they screwed up the other pizza even more...

2593 2018-12-20 18:54:46 Looks like crypto is the new hedge when the stock market goes down. Stocks are going down while crypto is going up.
2594 2018-12-20 18:54:31 Yes quite... I’d show these inferior brains a thing or two... but I’m completely indifferent to any of them... sat up here, in my ivory tower.

2607 2018-12-20 18:52:10 I love the fact that today crypto isn't giving a crap about the stock market bloodbath. Of course today's market action is not a proof of no correlation, but this is a good start!

I don't believe in the theory that people will sell crypto to cover stock market losses.

2611 2018-12-20 18:51:35 #coinbundle is a wonderful initiative which can greatly assist the beginner of crypto-trading. They are offering numerous bundles out of which clients can choose, based on the type of investments they prefer to make.

2618 2018-12-20 18:50:52 With all the fiat we are printing , the mistakes of the Fed, banks and payment processors refusing tech companies , the case for cryptocurrency gets stronger. I'm not saying to buy crypto, but we're on our way to the dystopian future that makes the case for needing it.
2619 2018-12-20 18:50:46 When did I say that? I live in a city I can mooch off ppl all I want too btw
2620 2018-12-20 18:50:35 Thank you!
2621 2018-12-20 18:50:20 The ugly truth !
2622 2018-12-20 18:50:19 lol
2623 2018-12-20 18:50:18 If you want a “good job” stay in school and make good grades.

If you want to own a business and live life like the 1% you dont need school, you need financial literacy and schools dont teach that.

Its all about perspective. School teaches you how to live the rat race.
2624 2018-12-20 18:50:15 not bad at all

you should really work on pumping up the intuition though. sensing is for normies
2625 2018-12-20 18:50:11 Passive aggression is one of my least favorite traits.
2626 2018-12-20 18:50:00 The #Lucre project has been extremely well received on icobench! The overall rating is 4.6 out of 5. I think this tells us this initiative is of the highest order. #LCR #crypto, #ICO,
2627 2018-12-20 18:49:34 lol. Do you want the government to do everything for you?
2628 2018-12-20 18:49:33 intj of course!
2629 2018-12-20 18:49:28 i dont have my name on the crypto as "project lead"

plus with your logic none of the xmr users should be able to criticize monero than since they've done nothing to make it better besides a few transactions on the blocks.
2630 2018-12-20 18:49:25 Awesome colab! Love to see this.
2631 2018-12-20 18:49:25 so many TD's on Tradingview. Could you please provide the link? Thanks again!

2634 2018-12-20 18:49:14 Yea make them all lighthouse campaigns (no middlemen). Then, shrink the IRS and we'll just pay our taxes by contributing to the various campaigns in crypto. Audits now cost almost nothing, and it's far more transparent.
2635 2018-12-20 18:49:06 The features offered by this initiative are fresh,uniquely different and of an extremely high standard! I would like to wish them lots of creative inspiration in the further manifestation of their vision! #crypto, #ICO, #Lucre, #LCR

we are much too smart for everyone else & it’s rather distressing {i am also a T after all }
2638 2018-12-20 18:48:48 Thought I would check out EOS knights to see what all the hype was about. 4 wallet installs later, 2 did not work the other 2 wanted EOS to create my account (nothing is free in the EOS world) I gave up. Hearthstone never gave me these issues :0
2639 2018-12-20 18:48:44 Or you can invest in my unicorn farm. Just as profitable. Make the checks out to me directly.
2640 2018-12-20 18:48:28 If you aren't an intj 8w7.

Yes.
2641 2018-12-20 18:48:24 The Santa Claus Rally in #Crypto is in.
2642 2018-12-20 18:48:18 Same here, but is not only because I have more money, is because all I learned through crypto trading about risk management, preserving capital, market cycle, etc.
I don't wanna spend money in something knowing if I'm patient I can get it at half the price it is today.
2643 2018-12-20 18:48:11 i found a link for Nepal ~ India yeasterday

2645 2018-12-20 18:48:05 When I first saw it I couldnt laugh cause my portfolio was REKT. Good times!
2646 2018-12-20 18:48:03 This seems much more like 2000 than 2007. No systemic cracks in mkt structure, just massive hype balloons getting popped. Crypto to Pot to Cloud to bought back middling growth (AAPL). The cuts will go deeper
2647 2018-12-20 18:47:53 Amazon could be a game changer for introducing new people to crypto. It could spread like wildfire from there!
2648 2018-12-20 18:47:53 Where am I on this list?
2649 2018-12-20 18:47:51 That’s totally me tbh
2650 2018-12-20 18:47:47 of course it was the best toppings are either pepperoni and peppers or no toppings at all. personally the best pizza place i know of, i wouldn't dream of getting toppings because they know how to make it best w/out them

2657 2018-12-20 18:47:32 Unlikely, after all, that would be severely limiting tax dollars they would otherwise receive, so can’t see any reason why they’d let this slide.

2666 2018-12-20 18:46:59 Yeah everyone has counts going down so it's nice to see the counts for a bullish scenario

2676 2018-12-20 18:46:14 Oh I know I just like the history. 

The US had no robotic rovers or robotic sample returnes. Also everyone from other countries to amateur astronomers and radio operators tracked them. It's pretty conclusive the Apollo missions where crewed.
2677 2018-12-20 18:46:14 because its trash.... it needs to die for the sake of cryptocurrencies future

2693 2018-12-20 18:45:17 Nah I think I'll let some other poor sucker do it for me because I'm not obligated too do anything myself I'll keep my money because I simply can.
2694 2018-12-20 18:45:07 @Crypt0Livermore Ur profile quote "The thing that hath been, it's that which shall be; & that which is done, is that which shall be done; & there's no new thing under the sun" is one that's resonated the most these past crypto-years & should be understood by techies everywhere
2695 2018-12-20 18:45:06 The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. This, of course, is oversimplified, but TA works based on this assumption. Ironically, the whole crypto crew, yourself included, just experienced this maxim with the recent bubble burst. It was written in blood on the wall.
2696 2018-12-20 18:44:55 Каго і як я дыскрыміную? Проста не трэба слепа прыймаць усе новамодныя аблуды толькі таму, што культур-марксістам на ніх удалося накінуць флёр "прагрэсіўнасці" і "сучаснасці".
2697 2018-12-20 18:44:53 It is ! Deep retrace into 4 of one lesser degree is common but we must make new lows on this breakdown
2698 2018-12-20 18:44:52 Well, in the crypto dimension, time warps, so the diff will be negligible imo.

2700 2018-12-20 18:44:48 So for you a USD crypto coin from the gov with a fixed inflation would solve all the problems, right?
2701 2018-12-20 18:44:45 And the amount of people talking about it not to mention the low google searches for it #crypto #bitcoin #BitcoinCash
2702 2018-12-20 18:44:34 Great article! I really love your book too! It was the very first crypto/ trading book I ever read, very easy to understand, especially for noobs. Keep up the great work

2713 2018-12-20 18:43:28 The only thing hindering the bull run is the regulations to my own knowledge. The banks and smart money are already coming in.
Remember who controls regulations matters. Only time will tell.

2718 2018-12-20 18:43:01 Was just gonna mention you lol
2719 2018-12-20 18:42:59 And Crypto will SOAR 
2720 2018-12-20 18:42:53 I understand that university may not be required anymore, but everyone should finish high school at least. And if don't go to uni, have a goal and work towards it, don't waste your life working part time and smoking weed.
2721 2018-12-20 18:42:52 Happy to know my dysfunctional self shines through 
2722 2018-12-20 18:42:51 we shall see ;) I like #XMR, but imo #XRP is the best crypto out there right now. And I am so confident towards its success, I don’t have to hate on other assets that I don’t own
2723 2018-12-20 18:42:51 muh roads!... it's almost like people couldn't travel at all before the government saved us.

You live on a street yeah? I'm sure you'd be willing to pitch in ab it every so often to help maintain it. Heck, you might even go out there and help fill potholes yourself.
2724 2018-12-20 18:42:50 Agreed
2725 2018-12-20 18:42:48 Lol, don't you mean Lord Ṣẹ́gun?

Crypto is just doing like this, like this and shaking again, to the right, left, right again... 
2726 2018-12-20 18:42:48 Technologically it’s one of the worst crypto’s out there, it just has first mover advantage.

2741 2018-12-20 18:41:41 Buying BTC is NOT irresponsible
2742 2018-12-20 18:41:36 To be fair the Soviet Union had 2 robotic lunar rovers and did do a robotic sample return.

However the sample size was very small and the rovers where nowhere near the Apollo landing sites. 

Also the lunar topography in the landing footage is exactly the same as modern data.
2743 2018-12-20 18:41:29 Bitcoin is up 25% this week.  Seems like money is fleeing to crypto.  Could get interesting.

2754 2018-12-20 18:40:27 lmao imagine taking this guy's advise
2755 2018-12-20 18:40:22 In a sideways market you'll get wrecked. Markets never go straight up or down. You're likely to miss out and when you get pulled in it's likely to go sideways for a time until some random event.  That's when your stop losses trigger your $ losses. It's never as easy as it sounds.
2756 2018-12-20 18:40:20 hence "crypto": as in there are no distinguishing features between ur politics and ethnofascism but u & ur ilk are not only irony poisoned but also massively pathetic wusses who shirk every responsibility but especially the consequences of ur hatemongering
2757 2018-12-20 18:40:11 Coinbase has been a strong player in crypto bringing so much light into Bitcoin in the U.S. more so arguably than any other platform. We owe them so much for being one of the very few still standing pillars. They support forks and that’s your arguement?

2771 2018-12-20 18:39:07 Crypto bloomed when  world cut rates to zero and below and that money found its way into a new asset class.

2786 2018-12-20 18:37:07 This is terrible advice and you shouldn't listen to it.

Does the value increases? Is it still secure? It becomes a better currency 4 transactions? Does it need maintenance?

2820 2018-12-20 18:33:36 Nobody continue school, then who can maintain and develop bitcoin?
2821 2018-12-20 18:33:34 You mean they use the transaction software. That I know. But XRP as a crypto currency is not needed and no banks are using it. It's two different things.
2822 2018-12-20 18:33:31 Yeah, crypto is cryptology, but cryptocurrencies are great for the field. How at how far we come in operationalizing ZKPs thanks to cryptocurrencies.

2824 2018-12-20 18:33:03 The question isn't whether the stock money will flow into crypto. The question is when will it flow to crypto?

You guys like #XRP because you want the pump, but the whole thing is junk.  People expecting SEC to rule it a security in January, so will see what happens.

2828 2018-12-20 18:32:41 Take a look at the symbolism in all the alt coins of the crypto markets. Nobody can say "i didn't know", because you jave been given the obvious clues. Only the true original Bitcoin (SV) is free from symbolism and was designed to help us take down the Matrix.
2829 2018-12-20 18:32:24 @RampCapitalLLC you better get to your local $CMG before it goes out of business. And use your reward points at $RAD before they are exchanged for worthless #crypto.

My farm currently generates 1.45EH/s and has been functioning for a year now. I have been connecting to fellow crypto enthusiasts to mine under my sub pool to increase earnings and get returns.
2847 2018-12-20 18:31:07 Hope so!! How sure are you?
2848 2018-12-20 18:31:05 reversal of what?like the whole bear market?we r not even close,u need that ATH red candle and probably the v shape and then maybe we can talk about it
2849 2018-12-20 18:31:03 Oh, I see. I meant the general idea of pressing a button that does crypto stuff, which could be in an app, or it could be a U2F device. Hence the confusion. If all the app does is tell you a number that you then use on the phishing site, then indeed that is not very secure.

Eventually you save up to buy a house, learning years later that what society told was an asset is actually a liability.

2886 2018-12-20 18:28:12 A fine argument made in favor of crypto. But I am curious about a couple of things. Some help please.
1. Even if a currency loses value over time, what's the issue? 
2. Bitcoins are limited but the block chain can be copied. Is it not essentially inflating the currency?

2926 2018-12-20 18:24:40 you’ve implemented, but it’s definitely not what I’d expect to see when being shown something called ‘conversational programming’.

If this gets bigger and the terminology sticks, it’s be a re-hash of the ‘crypto’ means cryptography/currency clash.
2927 2018-12-20 18:24:35 When we knew in april that major targets are around 3200 IT WAS A PROBABILITY. Now we see that although it reached and spiked the suspected response (positions being covered at 3k) we didn't know that it won't look like a bottom. But again - probabilities.

We hope this will make it easier for you to get started.

First one tomorrow! Stay tuned!

2993 2018-12-20 18:16:37 すぐ復旧するものだと思ってました。
恐らくこの2,3日bf上でcrypto watch不調のアナウンス出てたのでずっとやられ続けてました。笑
2994 2018-12-20 18:16:33 $crypto has taught me about finance more than any of my classes (College or High School) up to this point in my life 

Lets learn some more!
2995 2018-12-20 18:16:32 imagine believing in star signs
2996 2018-12-20 18:16:29 Crypto hype is worse.
2997 2018-12-20 18:16:17 We're long on our way in crypto and financial freedom
2998 2018-12-20 18:16:11 Why would you need 20 indicators?

3000 2018-12-20 18:16:00 A quick voyage, and one day the firewood gave out in the hour of his sight. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum
3001 2018-12-20 18:15:57 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。
3002 2018-12-20 18:15:43 Wow  deets?
3003 2018-12-20 18:15:36 Great chance for all of you #TRONICS . #Tron #Dex offering Christmas sale on #TWX #IGG #TONE #REY. Don’t miss this chance to have great Xmas with all #Tron community. 
Great times are coming i feel this freshness in all #blockchain and #cryptomarket. This year belongs to ##TRON
3004 2018-12-20 18:15:12 One persons beer money is another’s fortune... the big thing for those ‘normal’ people invested in #crypto, is the big hold and at what price they’re prepared to cash out. 
There’s going to be a huge ‘what if’ mentality over the next few years.
3005 2018-12-20 18:15:07 I think the current economy with all the complexity of derivatives crypto options ... “financial innovation” ... is rapidly outstripping the Feds ability to control via crude measures like repos and FFR.

Not sure what will replace it but that I think is the ‘Next War’ for Fed.
3006 2018-12-20 18:15:03 and for some ETH, I will tell you when it will happen again!
3007 2018-12-20 18:15:00 For an inverse head and shoulders on $BTC we would need to hit $4400, unfortunately this doesn't look it will be the case. Stranger things have happened in crypto though
3008 2018-12-20 18:14:49 Oh
3009 2018-12-20 18:14:43 you think it will go down to 3400 usd in next days again ?
3010 2018-12-20 18:14:20 It can land at any of the projected targets and a drop to around 3600-3800$ will most likely follow, which will then be corrected to 4k$ and then the magic happens and the trend will show itself. Be patient and/or trade the opportunities.

3013 2018-12-20 18:13:44 Spent the afternoon checking one's COCO CONSTABULARY account. Investing in crypto has paid off.

A "financial adviser" called from London to talk Emerging market biz.
Actually, one was on the phone with Egyptian mummy

Hung up himself after finding out one is talking in trillions
3014 2018-12-20 18:13:38 It can but somebody with the biggest exchange volume charges too much, so i hope @binance gives  $XHV a free pass

3027 2018-12-20 18:11:31 Because most women have zero real clue about crypto, they just use their boobs or smiles to get dumb schmuck followers who like all their useless tweets pertaining to crypto.

3030 2018-12-20 18:11:08 You can watch 10,000 hours of conspiracy videos but if you don't understand very basic principles of the topic your hours of conspiracy videos can be discarded as they clearly didn't teach you anything. Just reinforced your cognitive bias.

3038 2018-12-20 18:09:20 Maybe yes, check out the crypto vid I posted yesterday!
3039 2018-12-20 18:09:18 Most moon landing hoax talking points require a lack of basic understanding of science. 

Conspiracy videos and blogs are echo chambers of misinformation and cognitive bias. You demonstrateing your lack of understanding how rockets behave in a vaccum for example.

3132 2018-12-20 17:57:56 I think you lost people on the smoke weed and play video games part. So you’re going to retire with some money, but still fundamentally a loser.
3133 2018-12-20 17:57:42 They add calcium to it.
3134 2018-12-20 17:57:37 yup, same cycle had happened before, BTC up, people sell ALTS to get into BTC and miss the train, than ALTS start moving and people sell BTC to get into ALTS......same cycle...different day,

3140 2018-12-20 17:56:42 Everybody I know that was on that crypto currency shit doesn’t talk about it anymore
3141 2018-12-20 17:56:41 You think I am joking but I am not. I cannot stand the word crypto w no discussion repurposed and the repurposing accepted for this stuff.
3142 2018-12-20 17:56:39 didn't see you say Crypto is dumping and Stock is pumping weeks ago.
3143 2018-12-20 17:56:30 All mainstream (corporate-owned) news that's negative on blockchain/crypto and also ignores volumes of positive news, is part of the propaganda campaign(s). That's how it works.
3144 2018-12-20 17:56:27 You are one of the types that doesnt know how to discuss "properly". so not gona reply to you anymore

3147 2018-12-20 17:55:38 Lol @WhalePanda you are grasping at straws here. Brian has contributed so much more to the ecosystem and adoption of crypto then you have so maybe try being a little more respectful
3148 2018-12-20 17:55:04 Yes.  If there are political topics of a technical nature that are also in my experience, I feel qualified and justified in sharing my thoughts.  Some examples would be crypto and digital privacy.  Hope that Helps.

3150 2018-12-20 17:54:59 No no, I mean in comparison. 
Even if I wanted to join such an outfit (I don't but for a while 80% of LI recruiting I got was about such efforts), everytime I see the word crypto used like this context I shut down. I just can't be part of such an outrageous semantic hijacking.

3158 2018-12-20 17:54:38 Most cloud VMs are “rented” for short amounts of time for computationally heavy tasks, and then powered down when not used. This is unlike crypto currency mining that uses numerous GPUs around the clock and does consume large amounts of energy.

3162 2018-12-20 17:54:19 I’m equally skeptical of the value of higher education as it is today; unless you’re going into a STEM field.

But I disagree with the smoke weed, game and chill; you’ll retire a loser.

How about- don’t go in debt for a worthless degree, work out & improve your life in general?

3164 2018-12-20 17:53:59 Paul, you got it right those people that happen to be Crypto adopters last year will be thinking the world is going to an end this year

If you consider numbers of ICO that boomed previous year to the current status of the market it'll be like crypto will end

But crypto is good.
3165 2018-12-20 17:53:58 the project looks promising, the idea is relatively outstanding camparing to other projects in space, their team is solid. Great!! glad that i found out it early!!
3166 2018-12-20 17:53:53 I think finding a way to have an elastic money supply *without* relying on fractional reserve lending will be one of the core hurdles to overcome in order for crypto tokens to be useful as money. And I’m not sure stable coins pegged to fiat is the answer...
3167 2018-12-20 17:53:52 Coinbase wants to reward its users for "educating" themselves about some of the lesser-known tokens. The real intention is of course to create an illusion of competence - users are more likely to buy things they think they understand & feel in control. via /r/Bitcoin …
3168 2018-12-20 17:53:50 So there is marginal profit in btc compared to the rest of crypto? Why? If btc becomes world currency is that not huge profit? Or is it that CB don’t think Btc has much profit margin left compared to other cryptos at todays valutaions?

3269 2018-12-20 17:42:05 Crypto is by far the best asset class for charting, given how immature and retail the asset class is. There is a reason nobody in say equities makes decisions based on charts to manage money. Of course the chartists should run with it in crypto until it doesn’t work anymore

The crypto markets don't give a fuck unless it's an outright scam.

If it can be accumulated cheap, some MM somewhere will pump it and dump it on people later.

Important to have clear delineation of funds you're trading w & investing with and the time horizon for both
3315 2018-12-20 17:38:03 Do you really think these guys are going to allow this Crypto market to run without them being 100% on board?? 

I don't see any ETFs, Wall Street exchanges, or their retail trading yet.

No they want allow it, and nothing major will happen until the Bull market is blessed.

3406 2018-12-20 17:29:41 @Crypto_Ed_NL @CryptOrca @TheCryptoDog Can someone please explain why Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange's $BNB token always seems to fall when BTC is climbing? I would have thought it would climb as more people trade on it?
3407 2018-12-20 17:29:37 Compassion over judgment is a sign of someone truly conscious.
3408 2018-12-20 17:29:36 If you can’t afford their fee, blindly, you shouldn’t be buying crypto to be honest. You should be applying for jobs. 
3409 2018-12-20 17:29:35 @mappopk_crypto let's go

A promising project with interesting ideas and implementation ,a good company for investment I think everyone who is involved in the crypto should take part,believe in its possibilities
3416 2018-12-20 17:29:19 yes u tellem lupe
3417 2018-12-20 17:29:16 This reminded me of the crypto projects that were trying to buy a bank to "comply" with banking regulations and get access to institutional funding
3418 2018-12-20 17:29:14 RT cryptoinsiderne: Many secure and user friendly crypto currency exchange available in the market. So why you use binance like a shit exchange?

3427 2018-12-20 17:28:31 I'm pretty sure PETA members will be buying their veggies organic, but good try! 
3428 2018-12-20 17:28:30 Not everyone cares to be a millionaire though.  If money is all that drove people, the world would be a pretty shallow place.
3429 2018-12-20 17:28:23 agreed, I think long term it will play out that way, crypto still very small and young yet
3430 2018-12-20 17:28:20 I think @Crypto_Bitlord 's math is of because he took his own advice. Would he follow his own advice if Bitcoin didn't exist? Likely not. The advice should not need to avoid school, but a call to action to improve it.
3431 2018-12-20 17:28:11 crypto twitter
3432 2018-12-20 17:28:10 Дзе ненавісць? Правы чалавека прапісаныя ва Ўсеагульнай Дэкларацыі. Дзе там пра лгбт?
3433 2018-12-20 17:28:05 Point is pros don’t even use that strategy, yet crypto “plebs” know best? Cmon now
3434 2018-12-20 17:27:59 The first guy just bailed on Twitter I guess that makes me number one 
3435 2018-12-20 17:27:55 Fly about the big box which stood in the picture. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum
3436 2018-12-20 17:27:50 I'm not certain that bitcoin is out of the bearish woods yet. With the Mt Gox civil rehab coming in summer of 2019, I hope we will see a great upward trajectory by December 2019. Just being patient. Bitcoin has many qualities; its price will fluctuate - long term matters most.

3438 2018-12-20 17:27:45 Feds raise rates, crypto goes up...hmm 
3439 2018-12-20 17:27:44 I would add that if you use @coolwallet you're using the only wallet with baked in protection from @MetaCert, to alert you when you're about to send crypto to an unverified, or worse, a phishing address.
3440 2018-12-20 17:27:39 I don’t find that to be a problem w my followers. I see that a lot with crypto (that other kind) Twitter, alt-right twitter, etc. Tech twitter can be emo and complainy, but is generally at least in good faith.

We can check back in and see tho.
3441 2018-12-20 17:27:38 Miss me with that bs marketing hype
3442 2018-12-20 17:27:20 Bonds and housing market will be next, then the dollar, the most safe haven right now is #crypto which has already bottomed. Move to #xrp
3443 2018-12-20 17:27:14 You will always be second on any list I tweet 
3444 2018-12-20 17:27:00 That’s why he believes his tomfoolery. Every landing of the module you see dust blowing away from the blast f the rocket as it lands. He clearly has never seen any videos so obviously believes like a cult member does, through sheer stupidity.
3445 2018-12-20 17:26:51 I part the order book into buy and sell walls so you can find your positions.
3446 2018-12-20 17:26:35 Hedge with #crypto
3447 2018-12-20 17:26:19 $Pal is the  of the century
3448 2018-12-20 17:26:12 Big day for emerging markets & crypto inc
3449 2018-12-20 17:26:07 It is about cycles same like on all other markets.We have bull markets and bear markets. Growing follows falling and again and again. It is absolutely normal. Do you lost some money in crypto in this year? Maybe yes and you are hating it. But it will be back in next year stronger
3450 2018-12-20 17:25:58 Crazy timing for market crash/bakkt launch... might open some eyes to crypto
3451 2018-12-20 17:25:54 He definetely is not a human
I think its a twitter crypto BOT 
3452 2018-12-20 17:25:51 Coins being pulled to cold storage. #proofofkeys
3453 2018-12-20 17:25:48 Many of the apps I use are crypto related. If I’m going to learn how to be “hoe” I’d rather be a “Crypto Hoe”.
3454 2018-12-20 17:25:40 So what's your opinion now? Has it changed based on that breakthrough?
3455 2018-12-20 17:25:27 mikeydoeswork Yes. I believe that all Crypto falls well outside the charter of the SEC.
3456 2018-12-20 17:25:25 おぉー！！！！全然行きましょ！福岡来る機会あったら連絡下さいー
3457 2018-12-20 17:25:22 A common phenomenon for any business, thanks to them, #Eth has the best infrastructure of all crypto, good luck to them
3458 2018-12-20 17:25:20 When crypto bulls, it'll break 500 and find a new resistance level around 200.
3459 2018-12-20 17:25:18 Crypto sky rocketed also
3460 2018-12-20 17:25:15 What I love is that 24% are saying store of value what value when it fluctuates 90% in a year

crypto watchで見てた数値より倍以上大きい気がするけど、crypto watchってもしかしてbuy_volumeだけとか？

なんにせよLight chartとほぼ同じvolumeになってるので今までよりは正確にはなるでしょう！
(なぜ今までやらなかった)
3465 2018-12-20 17:24:38 How do you get these insanely clean charts? That shit just looks good.
3466 2018-12-20 17:24:37 Good point, but another (less centralized) approach would be to "encourage" the creation of a private RMB backed stablecoin while allowing allowing banking relationships to facilitate the audit and fiat on-ramp.  That could be used for payments AND to trade against crypto assets
3467 2018-12-20 17:24:29 #XRP
3468 2018-12-20 17:24:29 Did a lot of research on up and coming crypto because I kept hearing about it, and found the ONE ! #XRP !!!! #xrpthestandard #XRPtheFUTURE

3473 2018-12-20 17:23:59 yeah, tethering "engagement" to the Etherium blockchain seemed like a bonkers idea even at he height of the crypto surge. it's  a bummer that a lot of great writers there and at Hmm Daily are tied to this completely insane business model and already have to resort to crowdfunding

3478 2018-12-20 17:23:38 Do you think there is any chance they just cancel Brexit entirely?
3479 2018-12-20 17:23:36 It's "I should HAVE left". 

The present perfect form of 'to leave', is 'I have left', then you add 'should' after the pronoun. 

'should of' doesn't mean anything.

Aaand this is why we stay in school kids...
3480 2018-12-20 17:23:08 If they do it properly @coinbase, aka “bank” should educate themselves out of existence. Crypto is about eliminating cumbersome and greedy middlemen
