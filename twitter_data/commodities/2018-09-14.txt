Best model is to produce storable commodities (grains, squash, nuts, melons, tomatillos) in the periphery, and fragile/quickly-decomposing produce much closer to or within the city (greens, tomatoes, etc.)

40 2018-09-16 20:33:44 I invest heavily in the oil industry and some commodities.
41 2018-09-16 20:16:01 How lovely for the IRS to simultaneously treat crypto’s as both commodities and currencies while claiming to only treat them as commodities.
42 2018-09-16 20:02:26 It could work so long as 12/13 yr olds are not viewed as commodities which I am not convinced is the case
43 2018-09-16 20:02:06 I fear that billions of dollars in loans that China offers to Africa are a trap for the future repayment of commodities. Africa could lose the bargaining power of its own natural resources due to high debt levels( Sovereignty will be lost in the process)
44 2018-09-16 19:54:39 Resolveram extrair e não comprar as commodities.
45 2018-09-16 19:54:20 Perdón la ignorancia, pero algunos de esos bienes y servicios, no se valoran el precio dólar, como las commodities. En ese caso quedaría igual, bajaría en los bienes y servicios que están en pesos.

O governo é PSDB mas práticas são petistas. 
Um amigo agrônomo disse que os silos, incubadoras de sementes, empresas de insumos e venda de commodities estão nas mãos de chineses. Sem contar com os portos, como Paranaguá.

51 2018-09-16 19:17:36 I wonder if that works for other commodities?
52 2018-09-16 19:13:30 The facts is. The world shares and commodities markets statistic’s are not being observed. Manufacture of a high tier’s national reaction was devastating to some families. That compounded by higher tariff’s and low trade shows a stalling. This is usually exploited pre Winter.
53 2018-09-16 19:10:44 crypto legally (unfortunately) is not just currency...lots of commodities, securities and currencies. It’s complicated. Regulators should provide more clear classification systems in various legal jurisdictions.
54 2018-09-16 19:06:12 Not only that, but clothes and other commodities can easily remain in the private sector while essentials like healthcare and housing should have public options.
55 2018-09-16 19:05:37 W/E Wrap:
Unlike the #AllBalcks, most stock indices managed to get across the line on Friday night; currencies and commodities mixed; trade and #Brexit made some headlines, though it was weather events, particularly in Asia and the US, that dominated news feeds.
56 2018-09-16 18:53:22 #checkpoint @murathe doesn't know that people suffering out here.. Fare has gone up ,price of essential commodities has gone up.
57 2018-09-16 18:48:24 As standard commodities, 
Wall Street has us hurded, branded, corralled & indexed. 
Our worth to value, waits to be defined.

59 2018-09-16 18:47:02 Because they are kinda commodities, as the majority of the people in western countries.

At the best, they put a sad face and say they are ‘sorry for the collateral damages’.
60 2018-09-16 18:46:18 Let me throw this into the mix

The people who plan the marketing for such commodities are completely in touch with the weaknesses of their audience and they exploit it at every opportunity

You would not see a smoking hot babe in a little red number selling a Kia Rio
61 2018-09-16 18:38:39 Harder in different ways. Training is much more intense, games are faster, injuries are more frequent pro means less time to recover even grounds are harder.  All adds up to players retiring because they are worn out commodities. Different times etc. It sure I could do it today.
62 2018-09-16 18:33:55 So succinctly put. Rational thought and the ability to apply context seem to be rare commodities these days. As you said, Trump is the epitome of this 'new' way of thinking.
63 2018-09-16 18:27:59 Which is why trying to use competition to improve education is a non-starter for me. It's not responsive to competition in the same way non-public commodities are.

Each are rare commodities.
66 2018-09-16 18:01:37 More misleading information. A kilogram of meat will feed more people than a kg of wheat and they all have to be processed before they are eaten so the comparison should be the cost of a meal that provides equivalent nutrition not commodities.
67 2018-09-16 18:00:55 Apologies. I didnt mean to offend anyone. Just wanted to express what i felt. I saw a lot of Eritreans buying a lot of commodities. Thats all.
68 2018-09-16 17:54:27 Disgusting. We have no right to treat animals as commodities for profit. 
69 2018-09-16 17:52:24 Soo very v3ry sad, poor little animals. Truly disgusting on our side for allowing these creatures to be imprisoned for all of their sad lives and then only to just abandon them as if they were nothing more than property or mere commodities or objects
70 2018-09-16 17:42:35 It makes the players soulless commodities.
71 2018-09-16 17:40:13 I am direct to GTES commodities desk with institutional buyers and sellers. Can handle large tranches, 500k+. Buyer or Seller must be willing to register with GTES (escrow service) to transact. Message me for buy/sell procedures.
72 2018-09-16 17:25:10 Why? They can always deploy the USD to buy hard assets, or long term contracts in commodities. Hell, what do you think they have been doing in the last 3 years?
73 2018-09-16 17:21:00 In the 1940s, milk and butter were such valuable commodities on my family’s farm that my grandfather and uncle slept in the barn when my mom had scarlet fever and the house was quarantined.
74 2018-09-16 16:51:13 Who owns the shops selling the basic commodities
75 2018-09-16 16:51:00 will there be a end of Price hike of essential commodities??
76 2018-09-16 16:45:23 Não vive. O agronegócio com a exportação de commodities é responsável pela maior entrada de dollar no nosso país, é a base da nossa economia. Retira-se o agronegócio o o Brasil entra em um processo de sucessivas inflações e em pouco tempo estaríamos como a Venezuela.
77 2018-09-16 16:41:57 I have a cousin whose last name is Marx and he’s a commodities trader. really makes you think
78 2018-09-16 16:36:09 NOT TRUE! Maka-mema lang nagfifeeling ng "world market" 

The commodities that spiked our inflation are not sold on the world market. Huwag kang nag-iimbento di mo naman pala alam!
79 2018-09-16 16:25:39 Exactly so. The devil is in the details. And BOT driven by commodities is always fragile. This is why manufacturing is key: industrialise, industrialise and industrialise.
80 2018-09-16 16:14:17 Desde hace años Alfredo Zaiat publica una revisión anual de los pronósticos de esos consultores, ya sea del comercio exterior, precios de los commodities, inflación o crecimiento del PIB. Son insolventes pero interesados y sus errores responden a un sesgo de intereses políticos
81 2018-09-16 16:09:55 Entiendan... Ese crédito no es como tal... Tienes crédito para comprar SOLO   mercadería productos y servicios hechos en China... Será cancelado con precio actual de commodities entregados a futuro... Los chinos siguen haciendo un negocion
82 2018-09-16 16:01:49 Tomlin has always had that strong veteran affinity- sometimes in the face of overwhelming evidence. It seems he values experience over many other commodities, including talent.
83 2018-09-16 15:59:18 I have Matt Ryan and Sam Darnold on a team. I kinda want to play Darnold. Really strongly believe the Jets offense is 1 of the most undervalued commodities in fantasy football.
84 2018-09-16 15:49:07 ..and if you think stealing elections will do some magic on the prices of basic goods and commodities then you can dream on. Your dream will soon be over.
85 2018-09-16 15:42:05 Pfee prices of basic commodities shooting up like a Banana Republic where is the Pfee government?
86 2018-09-16 15:40:57 Some misguided Zimbabweans are celebrating what they claim to be a steep rise in the prices of basic goods and commodities.If you think you will get into power just because the prices of basic goods and commodities are rising,then you can dream on.Your dream will soon be over.

89 2018-09-16 15:09:42 No difra not blame monchi destroyers team after strootman all players now without loyalty cuz They are treated like commodities if their price rises are sold
90 2018-09-16 15:02:39 Rewari RAPE: It seems media shud refrain from reporting all rape-news but only keep a record of them. Publicity of rape news serve NO purpose BUT to tarnish image of this country. Empowermnt of Women IS all moonshine. We have reduced WOMEN to commodities cheaper than vegetables
91 2018-09-16 14:47:19 Although of course there are plenty of able bodied ppl living off govt assistance and using all of the commodities and programs our society provides without investing anything into it. What say you of these leeches?
92 2018-09-16 14:43:14 ...Food/water are commodities. Clean air has a cost too. Where do you draw the line? Pursuit of happiness you've defined as material possessions. Pursuit of happiness includes reproductive rights.

93 2018-09-16 14:41:50 Delhi petrol prices today have touch Rs.81.91/Liter d highest ever.Government should immediately reduce d excise duty & Ask state governments to reduce VAT in public interest on oil prices.The only way to bring down the oil prices and have checked on d price rise of commodities.
94 2018-09-16 14:37:53 Yet you freely use the commodities of which taxes go to. You're just a selfish child then.
95 2018-09-16 14:34:59 Used to pay Fare sh.80 before 16%VAT on fuel...Now we're paying sh.100,if the VAT is reduced to 8%,most commodities,fares won't change. Wacha we deal with the situation as it is.
96 2018-09-16 14:10:22 People aren't treated as people and due to their problems they are compartmentalized as thought they are commodities that can be replaced. Like paper.

112 2018-09-16 13:17:51 This might also help explain how guys who couldn’t get a date in high school suddenly become hot commodities in middle age and start steamy affairs. I remember seeing a situation like this & saying “but he looks like my pop pop!”
113 2018-09-16 13:17:46 This behavior is why Wal Mart will erode their market share on commodities, better than world books on physical copies, and someone else will hit another category. Death by 1000 cuts
114 2018-09-16 13:17:43 And this really wrenches my heart to the extreme,why do we as nation love misappropriation of funds by diverting them to totally unwanted commodities and services. Chairman you’ve brought up a very good talking point!
115 2018-09-16 13:11:06 Economic  lessons to the world
 1. Giving licence to more exports lead to price hike of commodities home country 2. printing excess currency also creates troubles, but insufficient currency also is very dangerous. 3. prevention of black markets is important
116 2018-09-16 13:08:39 Does Minister know the impact of fuel prices are directly attributed in steep increae in price of essential commodities or his claim to be the same since minister manages to refrain  such suffering too.
117 2018-09-16 13:06:26 Everything the colonials did was for their own benefit. Our advantage is a corollary of this development.  They transported all the precious commodities earned through the system they laid in colonies to their Motherland. We are simply misguided to praise them wrongly.

121 2018-09-16 12:39:04 My take on price hike. Let the hike be there control prices of commodities that may honi fue to this hike. Higher fuel prices will mean less vehicles on the road , less pollution, less congestion
122 2018-09-16 12:36:41 But the Commodities market is oh so very REAL!!
123 2018-09-16 12:16:44 We have starving Kenyans who can barely afford a meal , not because of laziness but lack of a decent job, prices of  basic commodities are up. Tax increases on everything , latest being fuel, next will be sex . Then we have this kind of lifestyle by the so called leaders.

127 2018-09-16 11:35:46 Every time i hear about dnd spells consuming entire precious gems or other non-renewable commodities, i get weirdly concerned about the erosion of matter from the prime material plane. But also there's create water spells so like. Who knows?
128 2018-09-16 11:22:26 Nah she won't  kcon Thailand has started preparing even way before gyul got eliminated  thus the line up were submitted and organized (plane tickets + other commodities needed)  

They can't just change the format cuz the organizers will be piss  just wait alil longer
129 2018-09-16 11:08:07 No it's dominated by the social relationships of capital, commodities, and wage labour.
130 2018-09-16 10:55:26 ” In the context of this growing interest the Ministry has produced this book, aiming “to convey Japan’s unique sensibilities and values to the rest of the world as the foundation of commodities and services provided under the Cool Japan Initiative.”
131 2018-09-16 10:48:26 The conviction was clearly lacking , when asked will he protest for price rise in petrol , diesel  and essential commodities, he was having a soft approach for govt not for JANTA!!
132 2018-09-16 10:39:37 Now listening to a really interesting #podcast. The #tradewar and its effect on #Brasil #soybean market. #commodities
133 2018-09-16 10:36:47 whats the value of rials lets say breads or local commodities vegetables eggs milk
134 2018-09-16 10:28:22 @deehaslam Its not good business to throw away valuable commodities. @JOSH_GORDONXII must do commercials because he's still under rookie contract & that deal wasnt ripped up to give more of a fair value. He must feed his family. He didnt intend to get hurt. Should not give away.
135 2018-09-16 10:05:01 NIGER Republic & CHAD are some of the biggest buyers of NIGERIA's harvested farm commodities annually.
Maybe the FGN should focus more on perfecting regional trade deals (ECOWAS).

137 2018-09-16 09:57:34 @WilliamsRuto we want to congratulate you soon for ensuring that we have zero tax on fuel and other basic commodities
138 2018-09-16 09:48:28 Bcz it’s only bread most Zimbabweans can now afford, remember rice and other commodities prices shoot up, so bread only left as the options to most ordinary Zimbabweans
139 2018-09-16 09:47:07 Oche what of Chiro Akala. It's also a place of such exploits. Good read. Show's high level of transactional intelligence among our people. We can and should have a commodities exchange market
140 2018-09-16 09:42:24 U stole words from my mouth - i keep saying even when fuel prices are high how come inflation is still low. Earlier we were told that if fuel prices rise prices of other commodities too rise!!
141 2018-09-16 09:31:13 It's sold out, but beg, borrow, or steal to see The Lehman Trilogy @NationalTheatre. It was heaven for a commodities geek like me and straight up one of the best performances I've seen in years. Funny, harsh and sharp.
142 2018-09-16 09:24:54 Highlights a fundamental issue with cash transfers when many people are net consumers of key commodities.
143 2018-09-16 09:24:03 All these alternative commodities are not given required priorities and as it is, Nigeria remains vulnerable as far its economy is concerned. May God give us good leaders
144 2018-09-16 09:18:03 To every person in this thread, you are not entitled to know anything. When the time is ready, it will all come out. Until then, we need to stop treating these athletes like commodities like they owe us all something. Either way it's Gordon's life, you are owed nothing .
145 2018-09-16 09:17:21 That is besidez the fact that that argument:
-Blames women for men's faults.
-Ignores that maybe the reason that they are alone is the fact that they are psycho and not the other way around.
-It treats women as commodities to be dstributd amng men.
-Is hypocritical cmng from him.
146 2018-09-16 09:17:14 The avg. asset value of a minister in UPA govt Rs.(10.6 crore) Still everyone in Govt. was clueless..INFLATION rate was highest of all time.
Essential commodities are freaking expensive.
147 2018-09-16 09:13:09 What help is currently given by universities to students to help prevent & identify student mental health issues? Has a 'bums on seats' approach treated our children like commodities & lowered the quality & quantity of such support structures - if they exist? @SamGyimah @nusuk
148 2018-09-16 09:10:29 I guess its MDC trying to sabotage the govt through hoarding, then causing a shortage of various commodities. Just like they begged for sanctions.
149 2018-09-16 09:09:59 What about the kids? He speaks of them as $ making commodities. Start school at 8am then have them stay there & paying for extra curricular activities to raise money for the school. Children need down time. An adult's work day is far too long for kids to be in the school building
150 2018-09-16 09:03:30 EngineerMark6 Fully agree! America has opportunity to make that a reality under Trump. This would be a major gain for America & at the same time will frustrate China's African agenda. Cobalt is growing into one of the worlds hottest commodities & the DRC has 60% of it. #Priority
151 2018-09-16 08:51:29 R u happy with hike in fuel price and other commodities?
152 2018-09-16 08:49:07 The tussle between vitol and bp in the Commodities market as well.
153 2018-09-16 08:47:19 #cochrane4all plenary one: open data policies don’t make data commodities all by themselves
154 2018-09-16 08:46:49 This coilation govt reduced d ruling parties MLAs to commodities & r on sale. No governance but only transfer business.
155 2018-09-16 08:46:19 Data are not just commodities that can be exchanged. You need to invest resources to make the data usable. Data management is expensive and complex. And essential. #CochraneForAll
156 2018-09-16 08:44:12 Because VAT can either be 0 or 16%! There is nothing like 8% VAT! What’s the difference of turning a zero upside down? The regime is the most corrupt and that’s why prices of basic commodities will continue to rise despite the prices of oil being low in the global market
157 2018-09-16 08:33:15 I had the intention but with the high price of political commodities I will have to sale our family house to buy ticket

159 2018-09-16 08:03:59 Respected BSP Supremo, Hbl Mayabati ji is absolutely Wrong & PL Think before Twitting, becoz of * Thr is no Economiical Emergency across the country *. The regular grossary commodities/ Vegetables prices r totally under controlled & Very approachable for all categories of ppls.
160 2018-09-16 07:55:50 Well the cost of production here pushes the price of commodities hire. Making people opt for any other alternative... Kenyans like anything foreign though... Food.. Music.. Boyfriends.. Sponsors.. Coaches.. I could go on
161 2018-09-16 07:54:01 So is real estate, intellectual property, patents and art/jewelry. Doesnt mean they are all the same nor similar. Lotta things have cash values the closest asset class to crypto imho is commodities.  Anyways my point is crypto is more currancy than stock or any other asset class.
162 2018-09-16 07:21:41 Simple, investors like to own in perpetuity. Stop building units that can be traded like commodities. Instead build rentals, leasehold and co-ops.
163 2018-09-16 07:08:59 “Commodities” jajajaja attaboy!! Y son mejor conocidos como los tacos “aladinos” en honor al hotel que esta enfrente.
164 2018-09-16 07:01:47 @RahulGandhi India's Ruling Top Brass can do anything they wish. None can stop them . They believe and Dream that they have Power for their whole life. They are not worried about increase in prices of commodities due high cost of Petroleum products.

167 2018-09-16 06:43:26 Now the situation has come that Almost Every citizen in india wants to dethrone BJP. They are torturing on people in every aspects. whether its petrol or diesel or rising prices of commodities. Whosoever dares to speak against them, they land them in Jail. It's Jungle Raaj.
168 2018-09-16 06:42:57 I think markets are leading, not following political movements. You see a clear commodity cycle throughout history, lead by supply/demand causing cheap or expensive commodities, people's expenses, moods, political preferences, and stock market valuations follow this pattern
169 2018-09-16 06:40:23 Also if you recall other commission like customs, FRSC,  e.t.c you will collect one of their commodities present it at a check point and they tell you it's a fake.  Please let her be

171 2018-09-16 06:36:33 Proper storage system, improved supply chain management is very necessary to use our products in a very efficient manner. You see, prices of diesel are on higher side, even though the prices of essential commodities are at affordable levels. Why ?

172 2018-09-16 06:25:09 Har han selv clearet/garanteret sine handler, så der røg et lag sikkerhed. Men problemet er vel, at Nasdaqs margin krav er baseret på historiske bevægelser... Men el er blandt de mest volatile commodities... Og så er der lav likviditet, så svært at komme ud af positioner igen
173 2018-09-16 06:20:41 Sir if your govt is so good n clean y the oil prices or pick any essential commodities are so high then wht it was under UPA? I knw u dnt have any answers plz sir start working b4 it is too late...
174 2018-09-16 06:16:14 Easy to blame falling production of oil and falling value of rupee for steep rise in petrol & diesel prices but why not blame the exorbitant taxes too. Govt must reduce taxes on petroleum products to give relief to common people. Commodities of daily use getting costlier
175 2018-09-16 06:11:49 In order to curb pollution & to reduce vehicular  traffic on roads let the petrol prices increase sky high. Control diesel prices for farmers & transporters so that  the prices of commodities are under control
176 2018-09-16 05:53:48 Yeldon >>>> Lindsay. I’d play White over Lindsay too. Broncos RBs hard to figure at this point, Yeldon and White known commodities and White has a red zone role.

178 2018-09-16 05:41:43 Jeff’s right that teams view players as commodities.

179 2018-09-16 05:27:01 Land prices are different from the market for commodities, being determined by how much governments tax land values and what banks are prepared to advance on them.
180 2018-09-16 05:25:06 Imagine having to explain that "conservation" only applies to a very, very narrow range of valuable commodities
181 2018-09-16 05:16:07 Canelo fought well as well as GGG!  Now this means that there will be another much hyped re-match worth millions to promoters as well as the boxes.  These two commodities are hot!
182 2018-09-16 04:53:53 Ease of living of Indian at as low as 133 in the comity of Nations . People r suffering from soaring prices of all essential commodities and gas , petrol and diseal . Shame on this govt s jumlebaazi
183 2018-09-16 04:33:09 No!leave the price as you found it before you came to power, fuel@0105,and other basic commodities.don't "develop" this country in expense of wanjiku.
184 2018-09-16 04:26:56 You need to read up on the relationship between cost of commodities, rate of inflation and high rate of employment. Can you manage that?
185 2018-09-16 04:08:11 Yeah a contempt of poor people is a disgusting mentality among Americans. Especially them "god-fearing" conservative Christians. Family Dollar sells almost exclusively food and household/personal care items, likely they're going for food and basic commodities in a trying time.
186 2018-09-16 04:07:33 It will devlop the real financial capability of tribal people, if it is extended to district level, definitely  generate employment and reduced price of commodities.
187 2018-09-16 04:01:55 1/ In the information age where physical transportation and durability of "digital commodities" over time and space aren't barriers anymore, censorship and seizure became biggest barriers to free trade. The most censorship-resistant bearer assets will win as "medium of exchange".
188 2018-09-16 03:48:11 In 1893, the price of coal was around $1,15 per ton (in a depression year). 

Its closing price Friday on the commodities exchange was $71.55 per ton.
189 2018-09-16 03:13:26 Increase in life expectancy is surely a good news but per capita income increase isn't that straightforward if we look at prices of essential commodities then and now

Pq, meu caro @AdsumP, o sonho ACABOUpq o Portugal fechou a padocxa e voltou pra Cascais. Não tem commodities pra segurar altas ondas, bro.
197 2018-09-16 02:37:46 Sir, Definitely, PMMODIJI / BJP govt's will be Good Success to control on the price Hike on the petrol & Diesel Across D Country. The other commodities price listing r in normal Condition. Although, regular commodities prices in Up/ Dn as per mkt demand & requirements. Vote F BJP
198 2018-09-16 02:27:38 The value of that income support is conditioned by capitalists that control all commodities & every productive facet of society. Again, a brief reprieve is granted by $1k but workers are still alienated from their labor & beholden to capitalists. Capitalism *is* unfairness
199 2018-09-16 02:23:17 All hollywood movies are just commodities of the culture imdustry as invinsioned by Adorno and Horkheimer with the exception of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.
200 2018-09-16 02:20:19 Interesting concept, I think Google and Facebook most likely got out of control, and it happen on Obama's watch, so it could be a mix, quid pro quo, and they just let it ride. Right on the money about oil and gold, but be on the lookout for alternate commodities being pushed.
201 2018-09-16 02:08:15 Chi na intends to resist trade war with USA, Chi na thinks this will be short period, after Trump off the job of president, war will be over.

So, president dump needs to increase force, starts immediate the import tariffs of all n every commodities to USA, heavily

203 2018-09-16 01:12:21 questionable commodities become find themselves reinvented in good culture and we act surprised by that every single time
204 2018-09-16 01:00:51 that's historically right. I don't disagree. But higher rates for now means higher stock and commodities prices, oil to 85, etc. At one point soon, based on this chart, the outperformance could start coming from commodities as money comes out of bonds

206 2018-09-16 00:59:22 Commodities have had strong headwind from improved yields and increased globalization. But so true endowments and big funds need relative return.  Once 10 yr hits 4ish I may worry about stock values
207 2018-09-16 00:57:19 Fowler "gets it too much" and Kurbskreep only gets pumped about known commodities he can hype up.
208 2018-09-16 00:54:08 no not short CRB. Been bullish energy actually. I've kept this chart for years, so no not hindsight. When assets are in strong uptrends, they outperform their alternatives, bonds, commodities etc. that's all

210 2018-09-16 00:26:37 No no this is infact the PROBLEM. 

Bitcoins are now trading at levels that are typically reserved for commodities or top tier stocks. The average person doesn't even THINK about owning a bitcoin they cant afford it.

What they're looking for is what they CAN own.
211 2018-09-16 00:14:44 Most folks here have enough elementary economic knowledge to understand that unlike commodities property isn't a fungible asset class, and therefore is full of "micro markets". They also know this fact has absolutely zero to do with the current correction.
212 2018-09-16 00:11:44 Los que esperan que está mega deva recree las condiciones 2003-2007 se equivocan. No hay súper precios de commodities y no está en el ADN de Cambiemos redistribución e igualdad. El modelo apunta a Chile, Perú, México. No Brasil , Korea, Europa Occidental.
213 2018-09-16 00:06:09 Only if there's a + expected return over time. The same is said of commodities in "the intelligent asset allocator" but they are not recommended. I do suggest reading the book. There is insufficient history to suggest crypto is any kind of diversifier & saying it that is false.
214 2018-09-15 23:51:07 Great chart. The extent to which the S&P500 has outperformed commodities over the past eight years has been pretty incredible...as a result, the eventual reversal could potentially be equally so.

246 2018-09-15 22:00:19 ADM, the Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse, a major ethanol producer, accounted for roughly 61 percent of the 9.5 million barrels sold at the Chicago hub between November and August, according to the data reviewed by Reuters.

#ADM #ethanol
247 2018-09-15 21:54:17 I actually listened to the song wondering if it was a critique of how our capitalistic system is slave driving and changes people to commodities because I know Britney doesn't write her songs.
248 2018-09-15 21:49:41 Bosta esse país ainda respira por causa do agronegócio das commodities tem dó...
249 2018-09-15 21:48:42 A luxurious day spent revelling in words. Up at 6:30 to pen a few of my own. Then to the awesome @SCBWI_BI Masterclass on poetry with the inspiring and talented @Poetryjoe. Then Lehman Trilogy at @NationalTheatre. Insanely good. Commodities as poetry. Happy me.
250 2018-09-15 21:48:00 It also includes disrupting local politics, overthrowing local governments, putting puppet rulers in place, funding right wing militias, funding local media, taking away workers' rights so cheaper labor will produce commodities to the US, etc. Trust me, we know.
251 2018-09-15 21:47:48 Estamos de acuerdo. A mí no se me ocurre otra más q subsidiar a los productores, bajar los impuestos, y no dependencia de la economía nacional del precio de los commodities, aunque eso implique chupar dinero de otro sector. Decime si tenés algo mejor
252 2018-09-15 21:43:51 E exauriu quando a febre das commodities passou. Não enfrentou o poder dos bancos ou o do capital financeiro. Agora o capital financeiro quer botar um fascista na presidencia.
253 2018-09-15 21:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
254 2018-09-15 21:32:10 I think that rejecting the view of animals as objects, machines and commodities is a part of ethics. I guess the question is whether eating an egg from a companion hen is inherently exploitative, and necessarily signifies that the hen is a mere product to be used and consumed.
255 2018-09-15 21:30:56 Vou te dar uma dica: o Estado de SP já era líder em IDH ANTES do PSDB assumir, e de 20 anos pra cá evoluiu menos q a média. Muito fácil pegar um Estsdo já excelente pra gerir e dizer q foi vc que fez. Parece o Lula dizendo q foi ele q descobriu o Brasil pós boom de commodities.
256 2018-09-15 21:22:28 No life for the poor cows, treated like they are mere commodities to enhance human life. Heartbreaking
257 2018-09-15 21:15:42 Acredito q quando a economia vai bem a política não estremece, então foquem no ministro da fazenda dos candidatos. 

Lula surfou na alta das commodities e foi oq foi. Os tempos são outros, mas o Brasil tem potencial, só falta direção. Liberal democracia é a solução.
258 2018-09-15 21:14:04 Let's see the commodities first   
259 2018-09-15 21:12:44 How about fare and prices of basic commodities. If this will not change the return the 16%tax. Business men, mutate operators take advantage of Kenyans
260 2018-09-15 21:05:05 4466: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
261 2018-09-15 20:52:39 Disagree with the death threats but the rest’s not wrong like. You’ve treated those children like commodities, like fashion accessories, poor things!
262 2018-09-15 20:49:56 @EnriqueViale “Existe un consenso de los commodities, en donde no hay oficialismo ni oposicion: todos coinciden en que Argentina esta destinada a exportar recursos”
263 2018-09-15 20:37:04 Kenyans we have short memories...

I remember your proposal on a uniform VAT reduction across board on all commodities (which was unfortunately shut down amidst the drunken stupor and noise of Kuria)...

But, that's our Kenya, where the voice of reason never prevails...
264 2018-09-15 20:34:28 Jobs at $7.25 an hour? $8-10 p/hr. for hard labor or strenuous work in extreme elements ??? A hot kitchen is worthy more than $10 p/he. Rents up pays the same energy's up pays the same commodities are up pays the same    bull shit
265 2018-09-15 20:16:54 Yeah, I've written a lot about that. Commodities are cost inputs in the capital structure. In the aggregate and the long-term there's no reason for them to generate real returns. And they're generally correlated to equities so they're suboptimal as an uncorrelated asset.
266 2018-09-15 20:10:37 This is why I'm skeptical about commodities as a useful component of a diversified portfolio. Commodities are zero sum (-sum with storage fees) and I doubt they have much insurance characteristics.
267 2018-09-15 20:07:15 Use some good spoke person in Rajasthan who have some knowledge. Why don't he compared price of other commodities during upa and NDA. Profit goes for beneficial yojanas. @AmitShah @narendramodi @sambitswaraj . @VasundharaBJP @BJP4Rajasthan
268 2018-09-15 20:00:43 Whereas the well-doing liberals who see immigrants merely as a means of cheap and menial labour, or a source for getting commodities, are not racist at all.
269 2018-09-15 19:56:11 Le pasa lo mismo que a todos los paises que dependen de commodities, en mayor o menor medida (donde por supuesto se incluye a uruguay). Lo q si es culpa de Maduro es no generar estructuras económicas q impliquen un cierto desarrollo. Lo mismo que todo los progresismos, digamos
270 2018-09-15 19:51:03 Y no, dejando de lado las crisis 89 y 2001 la pobreza siempre ha sido en el orden del 30%. Y así se fueron en 2015. Y eso que tuvieron ciclo de commodities record por favor, en fin
271 2018-09-15 19:40:48 reparou que a campanha Petista tenta esconder o governo Dilma. Fala da prosperidade anterior, mas esquece de dar créditos ao boom das commodities, a estabilidade do tripé...e principalmente que a irresponsabidade a partir de 2010 resultou na maior recessão que o Brasil já viu
272 2018-09-15 19:40:21 We are appreciate your concern for  mwananchi, but please let this not cause inflation to the prices of basic commodities Mr president.
273 2018-09-15 19:40:00 Money is a commodity... not a useless token only good for exchanging;... It differs from other commodities in being demanded mainly as a medium of exchange. #Rothbard

275 2018-09-15 19:37:06 When the state is paying for it even coffee and tampons are unnecessary commodities. Guess they never met anyone from a communist country.
276 2018-09-15 19:26:00 42-Coin was removed from Digital Commodities and the overall UMI Digital Asset Market Index, because market/exchange data did not meet UMI Governance Standards.
277 2018-09-15 19:14:48 Then add the other multipliers such as;-

Fractional Reserve Banking;
Mortgage and Loan issuance;
10x Leasing of commodities;

Show me an economically aware head of state or politician or banker and I'll show you a hypocritical self serving liar.

My dear brother, politicians are selfish
280 2018-09-15 19:07:44 Season 1 - Rising economic growth - stocks, C bonds & commodities/gold 
Season 2 - rising inflation - commodities/gold and inflation-protected bonds
Season 3 - falling economic growth - treasury bonds and inflation-protected bonds
Season 4 - deflation - treasury bonds and stock
281 2018-09-15 19:05:56 Prices of basic commodities began to increase gradually after Pres ED was declared the winner, so all these price increases are they bcs of foreign currency shortages or it's all abt undermining his Govt so that prophets of doom regard him as a failure???
282 2018-09-15 19:05:04 3187: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
283 2018-09-15 19:03:26 Blatant lies coming frm CZI. It's misleading govt in terms of price increases. Prices of basic commodities shot through the roof overnight. Is it foreign currency shortages which we all know or just sabotage. It's the common man who is suffering.
284 2018-09-15 19:00:22 x eso,cuando los precios de los commodities bajaron se comenzo a ver todo tipo de fisuras,devaluacion,se acelero la inflacion,etc.
285 2018-09-15 18:48:59 Trump overusing sanctions/trade wars at the same time has created an environment worldwide where they are unloading bonds and dollars, replacing it with gold...and using their own currencies for trade, eliminating the dollar in commodities, ignoring sanctions. The crashing dollar
286 2018-09-15 18:48:58 Why opposition wants #MODI G wear muslim prayer cap (Topi) while visiting Muslims religious places?

While our PM is busy in making common people to wear topi with daily price rise of one or other commodities.

289 2018-09-15 18:39:04 Sugar is a different matter..we import sugar & many such commodities like pulses out of sheer stupidity of lack of forecast planning in those commodities but your argument doesn't hold good for a strategic commodity like Oil..
290 2018-09-15 18:23:17 Here’s the POINT!
As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—So Will the Dollar,  Premium Growth Stocks & Bond Yields—As Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Corn Etc.) Decline.
As the Record Tax Cuts & Deregulation Fueled By the Greatest Growth Agenda Ever Implemented—DEBT—Will Decline!
291 2018-09-15 18:16:58 Anyone that understand Bitcoin knows Futures are literally useless. Literally. Why would you take future delivery of bitcoin when it costs nothing to store today. Futures only make sense for physical commodities.
292 2018-09-15 18:10:21 Libertatia and went on the uproarious “Hear, hear!” clamorously expressed as commodities, is the thoughts of alien source,

295 2018-09-15 18:02:22 Anything you guys want me to chart now? I have some time and i'm taking requests:

Altcoins, $BTC, Forex, stocks, commodities, you name it
296 2018-09-15 17:59:13 LPG retail is 140/kg PTI take a quick and rapid action for this mean meanwhile all commodities for a common man in daily need 10 to 15% raise has been observed why it's happening ur rapid response needed
297 2018-09-15 17:58:03 meio ambiente é a peça central da economia, conduzida pelo mercado operado por empresários e políticos. tudo que consumimos é obtido na natureza, do que comemos ao que vestimos. e o brasil hoje, assim como na época da colônia, tem sua economia baseada em commodities...que é?
298 2018-09-15 17:57:11 Un efecto relativo, el crecimiento de los decenios 50-60, 60-70 era bajo comparado con Europa, pero no fue muy distinto de los decenios 80-90, 90-2000, la diferencia fue que Europa estaba estancada.

Crecimos según el auge de las commodities, y ha día de hoy, es el 1er predictor.
299 2018-09-15 17:47:43 Black people selling commodities and living essentials really is the wave. Let’s circle this dollar fr
300 2018-09-15 17:43:42 What about agriculture commodities like Black Pepper and Rubber. These are being freely smuggled and dumped in our country. Hope the govt is listening and would takes steps to avoid huge forex losses.
301 2018-09-15 17:42:29 A related question: why make these moves after salary is already guaranteed? Did something change dramatically in the past week and a half with two fairly well-known commodities, or was the loss so jarring that they're eschewing all pretense that this isn't a tank, of sorts?
302 2018-09-15 17:38:24 hmmmm...yes and no. You always have the choice to say "you know what? I'm gonna wear my thrift shop clothes". Unless you wanna show the white urban middle class that you're one of them...Clothes are symbols, not just commodities.
303 2018-09-15 17:26:24 El brexit no es casualidad, fue la última, LA ÚLTIMA BALA DE PLATA para salvar a la UK de lo que viene, un descalabro masivo de los bancos centrales de toda la EU ante darse cuenta que el socialismo nunca se sostendrá sin producción de riqueza (commodities, bienes y servicios)
304 2018-09-15 17:24:44 During the last governance there was a race between 4 commodities to get past 100. Petrol, dollar, tomato and onion . And why don't u compare the petrol price at end of Vajpayee govt, during UPA 1 and UPA 2 govt and current one. You'll get your reply. Yes, the petrol price
305 2018-09-15 17:13:37 @libdems don't try & pretend decriminalisation is helping prostitutes . You r supporting  pimps to become "managers" reducing women to the level of commodities /encouraging people trafficking. Don't go to sex lobbyists for info such as  the pimp Douglas Fox who advised @amnesty
306 2018-09-15 17:13:23 A recession is different than policies and taxation that kill jobs and investment. Commodities will have swings in pricing, but why is the industry struggling now with $70 WTI? BAD policy, governing and unclear and expensive regulatory processes.
307 2018-09-15 17:07:20 Quando falam q o PT faliu/quebrou o país só uso uma palavra,                 " commodities"
308 2018-09-15 17:06:12 Any idea what is the inflation rate? Also, outside petroleum which is not in our control, what are the comparative prices of essential commodities?
309 2018-09-15 17:05:19 And the opposition may exploit again this crisis situation to accuse the government or the Duterte's administration of inefficiency and lack of action to address economic problems, food shortages, rising prices of commodities, etc. Ito ang panahon na dapat magkaisat/magtulungan.
310 2018-09-15 17:01:50 Tm petistas falando como no governo Lula o Br fosse país de 1 mundo.E a desindustrialização avassaladora?  país de commodities pra sempre?
311 2018-09-15 16:55:51 You only pay duty if you intend to use the commodities you are Importing. If transit, duty and other taxes are Charged by your country.
312 2018-09-15 16:44:04 @narendramodi @rajnathsingh @FinMinIndia please try to control the price rise of petrol and diesel, this will affect the poor people for price rise of essential commodities.
313 2018-09-15 16:44:02 Where do you see funds flowing when the SPX party ends? EM or commodities?
314 2018-09-15 16:35:58 Fato ? kkkkkk Colheu os frutos do FHC surfou nos embalos do crescimento da economia mundial e venda de commodities, tinha tudo pra ser um bom governo! Porem em vez disso seguiu a linha do assistencialismo e da corrupção!! encheu o bolso de dinheiro para se manter no poder!
315 2018-09-15 16:30:41 cooking gas is not cheap. Introduce 3 slabs, poor (300rs which will be subsidized),middle class(500rs) and rich(1000rs). Grains (45) ,oil (277)and milk(40) are not cheaper.Development should be such that no rudimentary and daily life commodities of ppl be expensive but be cheaper
316 2018-09-15 16:27:45 Sim ambas estão corretas, ele se aproveitou das Commodities e do mercado chines que estavam todos em alta, eu diria que alem da malandragem ele teve muita sorte no primeiro governo, ai já viu né, deu tudo que o povo queria, só que sem avisar que a conta iria chegarem.
317 2018-09-15 16:21:32 MDs paid as commodities — RVU is an RVU, no matter skill of surgeon who earns it. That’s the system we have. I don’t agree with it, but market forces not so active for MD pay. They are clearly active for executive pay — as long as Board does its fiduciary duty.

319 2018-09-15 16:20:36 I'm more of a Commodity Futures and Options guy. But now am studying for Series 7 and it is very interesting. Wish I knew more about the correlation between all the different aspects of bonds, US dollar, equities, interest rates, and commodities. Thanks.
320 2018-09-15 16:06:31 Crypto assets have qualities of equity, forex, and commodities. If crypto is successful in the long term it makes sense that their total market cap would surpass the global equity market.
321 2018-09-15 16:05:45 We used to stand in line for hours if not all week for things like fuel, sugar, bread, cooking oil and other basic commodities.

Many SAs would faint in the first 5 minutes if they stood in such queues
322 2018-09-15 16:05:41 actually want is money which keeps relatively stable value against a basket of goods/commodities/whatever.
I don't think alt-coins is what prevents Bitcoin from becoming stable.
The core issue is that people treat Bitcoin as an _investment_, that's why it's so volatile. If you
323 2018-09-15 15:47:00 Ah ok sorry missed that one. Thought it was similar to the commodities financing trade deals that were happening at some point.

325 2018-09-15 15:40:06 Uranium is at historic lows as are many other commodities, I think Uranium is a good investment right about now. However I’m riding the Nickel train as the stock/supply is at all time lows and demand is increasing.
326 2018-09-15 15:35:42 He sees us as nothing more than commodities.  Literally dehumanizes us.
327 2018-09-15 15:33:19 Fashion is a multibillion dollar industry - that can fluctuate the value of hundreds of commodities. Changes in fashion trends often dictate the rise and fall of businesses in tech and agriculture. Luxury fashion includes pieces that increase in value over time. Its news.

El trabajo en negro tampoco se esmeraron mucho en controlarlo. Repito. Cada comentario tuyo o mío es refutable. Y ni vos ni yo cambiaremos

332 2018-09-15 15:19:54 Since the Chinese started the abusive relationship with Africa we have encountered a rise in fake commodities. Alcohol, soaps, phones, food stuff etc. Don't we have the means to police this pattern?
333 2018-09-15 15:18:50 Don't mislead people. Prices for essential commodities r reduced in this comparison with 2014. Inflation is reduced to 3.7, GDP increased to 8.4. You r blot on satyagrah andolan and power politics as well. You r full of negativity for your ambition to PM without merits.
334 2018-09-15 15:14:14 O Lula pegou o auge do preço das commodities e não conseguiu fazer o país crescer como deveria (vejam gráfico dos emergentes). Aproveitou esse período para dar crédito exagerado a população e não investiu no país como deveria. Crédito é importante, mas não pode ser exagerado ...

338 2018-09-15 14:39:14 The rich get to buy some asset class "without actually investing in that asset class" through trading margins and derivative products and markets. It's bullshit. They get to legally suppress the prices of actual markets trading real company valued stocks and other commodities.
339 2018-09-15 14:25:00 I would think most of the countries mentioned have no issues with substandard imports recent destruction of inferior commodities has scared importers/businessmen kenya is growing its time we embraced quality over quantity. *my opinion*
340 2018-09-15 14:22:25 The DoJ was limited as to what they could do, specifically due to a piece of legislation passed in 2000 (See who voted for it btw) called the Commodities Futures Modernization Act, which had a much higher impact on the economic collapse in 2007-8 than the demise of Glass Steagall
341 2018-09-15 14:20:53 The only silver lining to the climate change is that the scorching heat, lack of agriculture and depletion of commodities of comfort will put the kibosh on "Reading book, drinking coffee, gazing wistfully to the rain outside" sort of Tumblr brand.
342 2018-09-15 14:13:26 Most of what you said is untrue. The recession was caused by Clinton when he signed the Community Investment Act in 1995 & the Commodities Future Modernization Act. These led to the housing crash.  Global usage of oil was down as well & then 911.
343 2018-09-15 14:06:25 Control of commodities, such as entertainment, and access to commodities translates into control over people.

347 2018-09-15 13:52:31 I don't hate anyone ma'm. Just trying to educate you on cross country price comparison. Consider what other commodities can be purchased at the price of a litre of petrol in respective countries.Based on that decide where it's cheaper.
348 2018-09-15 13:41:48 Las commodities siempre fueron en USD.
349 2018-09-15 13:36:42 Why should this offend vegans? It highlights a phenomenon called #speciesism. We love some species and treat others as commodities. Take care Lana

351 2018-09-15 13:33:28 I wish that @TOINoida was a little more than advertisement sheets (of commodities and admin and police under yogi govt). Noida would have been different. Abusing it's readership to propagate marketing of favourite govt is not done. Dishonesty in print is TOI-Noida.
352 2018-09-15 13:33:19 The 16%VAT on fuel sparked off widespread price increase of all basic commodities which taxes the taxpayer up to over 500%. The ONLY cure the consequent high cost of living is to abolish 16% VAT altogether. This will compel the exploiting businessmen to restore prices.
353 2018-09-15 13:26:57 Prezados colegas petistas:

O momento de crescimento e abundância do governo Lula aconteceu por uma explosão do mercado de commodities que trouxe muito dinheiro pro Brasil e por isso valorizou tanto o real.

Vivemos outro momento. Estamos quebrados. Não se iludam.

358 2018-09-15 13:19:13 maam, also the real comparision should be petrol prices + other commodities in 2013 Vs Petrol + other coomodities in 2018, this will give clear picture.
359 2018-09-15 13:16:00 A new business in town selling commodities is immediately in a race with the big boys to the bottom, and the more the town prospers, the less the merchants prosper as more discounters show up. But sell something you can’t get just everywhere and you may be able to sustain that.
360 2018-09-15 13:09:16 Between what Krappenstain and @thomaskaine5 spew, BS commodities are a good investment.
361 2018-09-15 13:08:58 Complicado é explicar para o povão o que é commodities. As pessoas toscamente acham que o PT em um passe de mágica trouxe toda essa prosperidade, fico mais indignado porque na época qualquer presidente eleito teria roubado do mesmo jeito.
362 2018-09-15 13:03:15 And then, our commodities belong to Russia and China, gold, petroleum, our financial sistem,  we fall down to the Hispanic era, been ruled for the big nations, such a shame.
363 2018-09-15 12:51:26 As  commodities ao qual a Luiz Inácio surfava. Não seja ingênua. Além do mais, esses programas foram criados por FHC em 1999, mas o Luiz Inácio se apropriou, como se apropriou de tudo que não era para ele se apropriar, até mesmo do presentes dado a nação antes mesmo dele nascer.
364 2018-09-15 12:32:46 China is working to change settlement of commodities to their own currency (Japan never did), and the US does not provide China’s military defense (as we did and still do for China.).
365 2018-09-15 12:27:45 I’ll say the loses Serves as tuition fee for those that are really learning!... have ha real loses but I have learnt a lot of stuff. I believe I am better equipped for the future.. already using my acquired chart skills to trade commodities and forex 
366 2018-09-15 12:26:58 If it ain't backed by real commodities, preferably precious metals, it ain't money. Yes, it's convenient to have fancy encrypted warehouse receipts for trading, but without the warehouse contents, it's counterfeit.

This includes, of course, all the world's fiat currencies.

368 2018-09-15 12:05:01 Money is a commodity... not a useless token only good for exchanging;... It differs from other commodities in being demanded mainly as a medium of exchange. - Murray Rothbard
369 2018-09-15 12:00:12 Why are you talking about human beings as commodities? This is bizarre  way of thinking about things
370 2018-09-15 11:57:22 Action plan, coffee: through commodities exchange farmers will transparently engage international markets and control the trading process.
371 2018-09-15 11:54:10 Action plan: inputs&extension services, governance and legal reforms, systems automation, commodities exchange for transparent engagement.
372 2018-09-15 11:47:12 @JeromeAgbojack8 We must create peace for ourselves by production of food, put light on cheating a first born of corruption and after worship practice the scale in selling our  commodities as from the sacred or holy books. Heaven sake Allow.
373 2018-09-15 11:38:51 In the Communist Manifesto, women are commodities, and go from being owned by single members of the bourgeoisie, to being common property. This will need to be addressed ...
374 2018-09-15 11:20:31 Time to shift to real assets! Commodities too
375 2018-09-15 11:17:12 The Army says about 800 Army High Water Vehicles from Fort Stewart, Georgia, Fort Drum, New York, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky are available for ground search and rescue, commodities distribution, citizen transportation, and patient movement. #HurricaneFlorence2018
376 2018-09-15 11:13:29 Animals will be animals. Male supremacist pigs abound such areas. This has got nothing to do with BJP-RSS. For being animals forever why go about blaming BJP-RSS? Introspect why Females are treated as commodities & why no girl/woman, sister/mother is safe there since forever?
377 2018-09-15 10:59:48 Almost all the countries in the list hv currency weaker than dollar so using so $ would fit to be suitable  index and secondly it amazes me how Bhakts are obsessed with cheap Data/plan when prices of basic commodities are spiralling up
378 2018-09-15 10:44:14 "Patriarchal structures" still exist because we still live under patriarchal capitalism, because there still exists a concrete 'division of labour' between the sexes vis a vis the reproduction of humanity & the production of our means of existence, & capitalist commodities.
379 2018-09-15 10:29:58 import curbs, or engaging Govt agencies under blanket permit to import certain commodities NOT GOOD FOR THE INDIAN ECONOMY, BUREAUCRATIC NEXUS IS MORE ACUTE AND CHRONIC@ANY SPHERE OF ADMIN.
380 2018-09-15 10:26:38 1. For the 16 monitored commodities adequate foreign currency has to be availed to prevent these from being beyond reach.
2. We have to unpeg the Bond & RTGS credit balances so money flows back into the formal system.
3. ATMs should be loaded with Rands & Pula to dilute US$
381 2018-09-15 10:16:38 tataas na naman ang mga commodities ng mga gulay dahil tinamaan ng mahigpit ang agrifarms sa CAR  kuuh
382 2018-09-15 10:01:19 Repeated expenditure on natural disasters and unproductive growth may make many governments go bankrupt or debt ridden or high prices of commodities across the world
383 2018-09-15 09:45:01 My thoughts exactly. They should write that into their plan. Stealing hectares off other commodities isn’t going to happen.
384 2018-09-15 09:27:19 It is cheap in North India .How Modi is to be blamed for its low price in Tamilnadu ? The differential price of some agricultural commodities is implemented by some state governments only .
385 2018-09-15 09:23:52 The continuous price spikes of basic commodities is a  response to ED's appointment of a de facto/second/parallel cabinet of ZANU PF deadwood at the its headquarters in tandem with a de jure cabinet at Munhumutapa all eating from national TREASURY. Economics dont need deception
386 2018-09-15 09:23:20 We are struggling to live beyond  our means,  cost of commodities have gone but salaries and wages are still the same.  Mr president @UKenyatta do something  about  your government.  Call for a referendum  and reduce this unnecessary  spending  in counties and Commissions.
387 2018-09-15 09:23:18 So are you, Tammy & ppl who treat animals as "commodities" need to be locked in a room with a pack of VERY hungry dogs (wild or domesticated) it would be fun (to me) who cries for their momma first!!
388 2018-09-15 09:15:56 But this also takes us back to what the rules of engagement is with Eritrea in regards to trade. As it stands Eritreans are using USD to buy basic commodities in Tigray, including cement.
389 2018-09-15 09:15:50 Spelling was deliberate, don't digress.
2nd, classification is on daily commodities vs luxuries not essentials vs non essentials.

For 3rd point, refer my tweet once again. You haven't read properly.
390 2018-09-15 08:48:39 @PMOIndia As a citizen of India.. you will be knowing that All the commodities for daily usage gets increased due to Diesel and Petrol price increase.. Whether oil and gas are sold in India for rich people.. #NarendraModi
391 2018-09-15 08:23:45 Not so fast..Kenyans we forget so fast..wait for 2021..they will subsidize the prices of key commodities and we shall be dancingvto their tune
392 2018-09-15 08:21:37 You didn't propose that but then why can't you impose taxes on things like soda or even cigarettes instead of imposing taxes to such important commodities
393 2018-09-15 08:21:05 Your favourite Government survives of PR. 

Your favourite Govt has experience in using optics to distract you from important debate like punitive taxes and rising cost of basic commodities
394 2018-09-15 08:10:16 NOW THAT PEACE IS FINALLY SIGNED, CAN THE PRICES OF COMMODITIES BE REDUCE TO THE COMMON SOUTH SUDANESE?
395 2018-09-15 08:10:02 Don't worry about the minor nuances of investing or trading, just focus on core principles and strategies that seem timeless. This could apply to #stocks, #commodities, #bonds, #cryptocurrency, and even #forex. 

In the end markets and exchanges are all the same.
396 2018-09-15 08:02:46 And we are treated as commodities for our capitalist overlords.
397 2018-09-15 08:01:05 What money are they using to buy our commodities? If this is the usual contraband using nakfa or birr? Then they don't know what is coming to them. They MUST use dollar and exchange it in our banks before buying anything full stop.#Ethiopia #Tigray #Eritrean
398 2018-09-15 07:58:28 Cheap level politics by BJP...
No comments on rising prices of commodities, fuel and depreciation of Rupee.

People are watching you.
399 2018-09-15 07:35:16 honestly I don’t think it’s fair to point fingers at other cultures, treating animals as commodities really seems to be universal unfortunately :(
400 2018-09-15 07:32:33 Are we back in the 15th century where we consider spices as hot commodities?
401 2018-09-15 07:31:09 I've resorted to saying God you know everything.I don't know where we are heading to, got kinda disturbed yesterday seeing increases in prices of commodities. And thinking even if i want to buy from outside t's worthless cz maexchange rates acho zvaarikuita um.Salary raise dololo
402 2018-09-15 07:26:59 As Kenyans we are left to look upto heaven......and trust in Psalm 121 UK and government a big let down to Kenyans. Double high cost of living skyrocketing prices of commodities affecting the low and middle income citizens. God come through for us and deliver us.
403 2018-09-15 07:20:28 Kudos to Lagos for all that had been done so far. If other States would do a bit of what is happening in Lagos, Nigeria would be better. Lagos, don't rest yet; more grease to your elbow. Please do something on the commodities fast.
404 2018-09-15 07:20:10 @sanabucha 
Comparison can only be drawn between similar commodities not apples & oranges.
One is $ & other Rs.
405 2018-09-15 07:01:36 Good business. Increase price of all commodities and then decrease price of stents. So that people get heart attacks with expensive living and are forced to buy stents. Kudos!! 
406 2018-09-15 06:58:53 Block Commodities Limited (NEX: BLCC), the innovative commodity trader operating in Africa, has announced a strategic partnership with Pure Grow Africa Limited (Pure Grow), a leading supplier of high-quality agricultural produce based in #Uganda.

410 2018-09-15 06:10:45 Sad to say, nag weaken peso against dollar ; increased inflation rate; and now tyhoon Ompong. We can encounter shortage at times like this, prices will intend to rise because it is directly proportional to supply of commodities.
411 2018-09-15 06:08:48 @Rose4Justice Babies for Taxes!  Babies for Bribes!  Babies for Organs!  Babies for Human Tissue!  Babies are Human Commodities for Profit!   Babies in Demand!

412 2018-09-15 05:40:11 See Mr. Tyson God is good it is man that wants to place these things for commodities in the middle of mother natures Path. Not to mention all the fracking and the pollution. We are pumping out the blood of the earth you expect the earth not to respond? 2 of 2 @neiltyson

Great for newbie traders. Also, if anyone looking for passive income. Take a look at the project. You will love it.
414 2018-09-15 05:24:21 If the entire world suddenly lost the convenience of our modern transportation technology for commodities for 3 days. The entire worlds economic and governmental systems would collapse. This is because the very first thing that would disappear would be food off store shelves.
415 2018-09-15 05:24:04 Starter homes literally not a thing with our land values. All single detached homes are luxury commodities if you live in Vancouver proper
416 2018-09-15 05:19:51 People want to be seen to have congratulated the president dp or otherwise,

430 2018-09-15 03:47:44 Em qualqr discussão,sobre a crise no Brasil,esses três pontos devem estar unidos:

-Crise Econômica Mundial
-Commodities
-Oposição oportunista

O antipetismo foi criado tendo esta base
A tática da mídia e oposição é usar:

-Crise no governo Dilma
-PT quebrou o Brasil
431 2018-09-15 03:46:08 To be clear I wasn’t suggesting 6 per for Darnell just using the educated guess contracts Tambo handed out to unproven commodities
432 2018-09-15 03:37:05 But that means that train fares will be revised soon & thus freight charges also will be increased causing a net rise in price of commodities - cement etc & also electricity as coal is transported in bulk.
Inflation will again creep in.
433 2018-09-15 03:20:25 Our cell phones or land lines for that matter are not public commodities. We bought and pay for them and mine is not available to this criminal. This cannot be legal to be subjected to forced communication from an undesirable source.  I did not cast my ballot for him.

435 2018-09-15 03:02:33 Bad start for ED. Cholera outbreak - no drugs in hosp and Price hikes for basic commodities. Closures of Mining industries. Cash shortages
436 2018-09-15 03:01:33 Continue to protect sugar. Hello Byron, you take sugar money with no regret. Regardless, the best way to shut down sugar is to end the price support and cracker legislation that forces us interests to buy overpriced commodities.
437 2018-09-15 02:59:46 I think I'd rather have laws based around the idea that people are unique individuals with a divine spark, than laws based around the idea that we are soulless automatons that should be treated as commodities.
438 2018-09-15 02:30:07 @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia @ncdex @sebi @gssjodhpur @sebi India need to remove all those commodities from ncdex which are being exported. Ncdex is giving loss to Indian exporters and promoting speculation in market.  #boycottncdex

440 2018-09-15 02:01:32 i hope some people realize how disastrous the effect of inflation rate to basic commodities in times like this
441 2018-09-15 01:42:41 Exellent. White commodities speculators have their reps!

443 2018-09-15 01:39:44 De fato, as conjunturas são diferentes hoje do que quando os países absolutistas simplesmente proibiram exportações de commodities e aumentaram barreiras protecionistas. Mas o protecionismo é uma realidade hoje como era ontem.
444 2018-09-15 01:36:21 It seems weird to say this about one of the most popular commodities in music history but it is true that people claim not to like Nirvana and the only explanations I can think of are 1. closed mindedness/unwillingness to just listen 2. willful insensitivity 3. hatred of women

Freedom of movement is restricted

Nonsensical drug laws

People are literally killed in fighting and wars based around commodities (yes we mean oil)
Etc.

450 2018-09-15 00:33:56 the idea that we should not air out our concerns about the high inflation rate which causes the surge in the prices of our basic commodities because "we've been through worse" is so fucked up, twisted, and devoid of any empathy.
451 2018-09-15 00:30:24 @mark_butler obviously doesn’t know that coal exports and prices are increasing. In a trial world as apposed to the @AustralianLabor world this means that demand is increasing. why is it so? @AlanKohler on their @abc does not  report coal prices in his commodities report? 
452 2018-09-15 00:29:38 i wonder if it's easy for most kfans to drop their bias group because of whatever they deem a "scandal" ex. dating, as most of these groups aren't allowed to write or produce their own songs and are basically commodities of the industry so they mostly stan for visuals
453 2018-09-15 00:00:58 La gente aquí siempre ha comprado con descuentos en verga porque no monitorean los precios antes de que saquen los anuncios. El punto no es que los descuentos están de la fregada, es que literal todo ha subido de precio ridículamente, y la plata no alcanza, sólo para commodities

Big red flags all over the place...
461 2018-09-14 23:29:28 I have long been angry about the fact that children in other countries are often treated as commodities but hearing the personal experiences of those who have lived this just makes me even more furious.

He is dangerously deranged!
465 2018-09-14 22:29:25 Price stability is one of the core responsibilities of #centralBanks. But what does "price" here refer to: commodities or assets? (perhaps both) If the spirit of the mandate is maintaining stable living standards, then that price stability should include #assets, surely. 1/

469 2018-09-14 22:05:40 Mhmm. 

We don’t really have anything they want. Except maybe some tech or access to cheap Ag commodities. 

They just want us to not fuck with them I think.

472 2018-09-14 21:46:39 i dunno, I think "commodities" is probably actually the right sort of category for things like bitcoin. it's sort of the default category that just means "stuff you could buy by quantity".

Big red flags all over the place...
480 2018-09-14 23:29:28 I have long been angry about the fact that children in other countries are often treated as commodities but hearing the personal experiences of those who have lived this just makes me even more furious.

483 2018-09-14 22:30:24 One who has not one cell of compassion in his body. One who thrives on chaos not only in our nation but also in the lives of those closest to him. One who believes that people are commodities that can be cheated, abused, and manipulated.

He is dangerously deranged!
484 2018-09-14 22:29:25 Price stability is one of the core responsibilities of #centralBanks. But what does "price" here refer to: commodities or assets? (perhaps both) If the spirit of the mandate is maintaining stable living standards, then that price stability should include #assets, surely. 1/

488 2018-09-14 22:05:40 Mhmm. 

We don’t really have anything they want. Except maybe some tech or access to cheap Ag commodities.

491 2018-09-14 21:46:39 i dunno, I think "commodities" is probably actually the right sort of category for things like bitcoin. it's sort of the default category that just means "stuff you could buy by quantity".

492 2018-09-14 21:46:12 Expect increased prices in rice commodities. Taking into account that Cagayan Valley acts as of one of the major suppliers of grains in the country, the destruction of the region's unharvested rice farms can only guarantee an unreceding inflation rate.

573 2018-09-14 15:52:00 Interesting, Hayek's idea was a basket of commodities which had more utility value Wheat/Copper/Rubber etc. Go back again to 1650 and we had competing banks issuing their own notes, so it can happen. Although from a practical sense in 1650 most people never left their own town..
574 2018-09-14 15:47:58 You are right! There should be no commoditization arrow from Transformations (for the customer IS the product and humans cannot be commoditized), nor a customization arrow for commodities (which are fungible and cannot be changed much less customized). Good catch, Wouter.

595 2018-09-14 14:34:26 Indeed. And it should scare the cr@p out of any #brewer who makes an IPA.  Consumer perception of IPAs as interchangeable commodities start us (back) down the road to needing just a handful of breweries.  #craftbeer #beer #BeerFriday

603 2018-09-14 14:07:26 They don't need to, ALL nations need '$ dollars' to buy commodities, especially Oil.
This is why Russia, China, Iran, Brazil, Syria, India, S Africa er al, have stopped using the dollar. Pretty soon US will be flooded with dollars, what happens then? Collapse!

609 2018-09-14 13:48:34 It’s necessary to raise prices of commodities so as to lower the difference between Dollar and Rupee and that’s exactly what governments is doing now.
610 2018-09-14 13:42:35 @mrBobbyBones women’s  bodies  are  not  a  distraction   how about instead we hold men and boys accountable for treating women with respect and teach them that women and girls bodies aren’t commodities

612 2018-09-14 13:34:26 I follow financial markets but hate headlines like "Oil prices down since hurricane not as bad as expected" as if it's not good. 1) it's insensitive to those in the way 2) I invest in mutual funds, not commodities 3) Low gas prices mean we all can buy more things, helping economy

615 2018-09-14 13:28:43 Mitigating big trades and positions requires defense in depth; when at risk committe always looked at ratio of price limits and initial margin parameters; cases where former was greater than latter (some commodities) were supposed to be covered by fund
616 2018-09-14 13:24:04 The fuel prices will be increasing with 0.001% every other week and month, before we realize we will have landed on the 16% and beyond by December. Prices of the commodities will do the same, let's keep our spirit awake, and pray for Kenya.

619 2018-09-14 13:17:02 Podría ser que el camino a seguir por Argentina no sea el mismo, ya que su economía tiene otras realidades (exportador de commodities agrícolas, compitiendo con países limítrofes). Pero la experiencia ecuatoriana con el dólar "tiene más sostenidos que bemoles".
620 2018-09-14 13:16:45 @OAmollo. Parliament should reject Uhuru proposals in toto and instead increase VAT to all products by 2from 16% - 18% coz petroleum has trickle down effect on all products. Scrupulous businesses are scandalously increasing prices of commodities not relative 2fuel increment cost.
621 2018-09-14 13:13:17 Para eso existe la estadística y la economía para ver datos concretos. Cuando los políticos se dedican mirar unicamente a la gente y desatienden que tú economia se basó en un viento de cola por el precio de las commodities, ese es el resultado. Puro populismo.

623 2018-09-14 13:12:24 Really solid treasury auctions, rolling over consumer and producer prices, #commodities rollover in May and bond futures still fall.

Doubling down against the obvious isn't helpful. Didn't help #crudeoil demi-God Andy Hall in 2014-2015.
624 2018-09-14 13:05:02  traders to lower prices of commodities, never happened and never will.
625 2018-09-14 13:04:36 Whether or not the VAT is reduced to 8%,  the mwananchi will continue suffering. Bus fares and prices of basic commodities won't come down. Ours is a man eat man society. Period #UhuruAddress
626 2018-09-14 13:02:49 118 is still on the higher side compared to the 112 that was there previously ,commodities will still hike.

629 2018-09-14 12:58:58 The burden on Kenyans is too heavy.. more jobs gone, prices of basic commodities have gone up. Really Mr. President is fair for low income earners?
630 2018-09-14 12:58:44 What makes one commodity distinct from another commodity? Why is this an important distinction => “....is not about an actual individual commodity as distinct from other commodities....”?
631 2018-09-14 12:57:08 ......“an immense accumulation of commodities,” its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.”
632 2018-09-14 12:55:39 Let me say this simply. WOMEN ARE NOT COMMODITIES!  The notion of SMV is just another way for creeps like you to diminish even the most accomplished woman to mere property status.
633 2018-09-14 12:49:34 I can't work out if I find this more hilarious or horrifying? Like, for all its stupidity, its also incredibly chilling to see how they see women as habitual commodities instead of, y'know, people.
634 2018-09-14 12:48:11 Funny how that antifa kid said “we gonna do him like Gaddafi” when Gaddafi was [allegedly] just trying to set up a currency based on African commodities without government bonds/institutional credit, the most antifa thing to do ever.
635 2018-09-14 12:47:07 At present condition of India fuel price hike and asential commodities increasing brake down of faith of NDA govt. from the  democratic people of the nation. I think that people should realise of present condition with the compare  of previous government.
636 2018-09-14 12:44:32 Do that with other commodities too like food, it's becoming expensive for an ordinary wanjiku to put good food kwa meza

639 2018-09-14 12:35:59 Bco of this mh govt charged extra local charges which leads to higher prices on some commodities like fuel etc compared to other states..also govt took loan for making salaries.
640 2018-09-14 12:35:01 For @kipmurkomen William Ruto&Moses Kuria, get this: Kenyans are not opposed to 16% VAT  but because of its domino effect on other commodities and most importantly their FEAR that some of you would LOOT IT for 2022;that's why you hear @UKenyatta reassuring us #StateOfTheNation
641 2018-09-14 12:33:52 @UKenyatta Mr President make sure that the traders  also reduce the price of commodities that were hiked as a result of that 16% VAT including bud fare.
642 2018-09-14 12:33:41 Depois de sair do consulado americano, percebo que além de commodities o Brasil também exporta bastante gente feia.
643 2018-09-14 12:28:38 Appealing to social Darwinists can seem like a futile gesture...the neo-liberal dogma classes these children as commodities to make money....and that is all that matters to them.....money.
644 2018-09-14 12:26:16 By the way, now that prices of commodities and services had already gone up, will the business sector lower them in tandem with the 8% VAT proposed if it is adopted ama they will think wameangukia? #StateOfTheNation
645 2018-09-14 12:20:42 People who reduce themselves and others to commodities miss the entire point of being human. We are complex creatures and our needs change as we mature. Or they should, unless you're an emotionally immature male who thinks of women as commodities.
646 2018-09-14 12:16:59 Darshan are this guys innovating and creating devices or technologies that improve things or are they still trading the same old commodities or building platforms based on someone else’s IP?
647 2018-09-14 12:13:47 Mr president did u know that in Kenya once prices of commodities rise they never come down? Wacha tuumie na hiyo bei tumezoea

651 2018-09-14 12:01:46 #StateOfTheNation what if the Treasury increased the VAT on petrol to 25% and leave diesel the way it is? All productions and transport in the country heavily depend on diesel. The prices of almost all commodities won't be affected.
Making luxury more expensive, private cars!
652 2018-09-14 12:00:59 Follow up, I whole heartedly agree with you on "American" culture and excess marketing useless commodities. Only made Soviet comment in regards to archetype of bleat shelves in Old USSR. Light counterpoint. Kruschev Nixon kitchen debate era.
653 2018-09-14 11:59:13 Mr president you are the eye of the nation. please see how the wanjiku is suffering.Essential commodities should more cheaper as u cannot pay 50/= transport to buy a half kilo of flour at 70/=.we voted for u for a better life not an expensive life
654 2018-09-14 11:54:51 Bezos & Zuckerberg made wealth by their ability to sell a product faster on a world-wide basis regarding commodities, but unlike old money that made money a commodity they change by legacies.  More billionaires exist in this decade than ever by the speed of selling & trade.

656 2018-09-14 11:38:30 Something about producers and businessmen in this country is when fuel prices are shot up and they consequently increase prices of commodities, they never reduce on government reducing levies.

In effect of 16-8% it must be reflected on prices or else it’s criminal.
657 2018-09-14 11:36:14 Comerciais de TV vangloriam a tecnologia alemã, japonesa... afinal, mais do que a tal síndrome de vira-lata, o problema do Brasil é investir pouco em tecnologia e inovação (exceto na parte de commodities).
658 2018-09-14 11:20:25 16% to 8%..better! Everyone is feeling the heat of skyrocketing price of commodities. Here in Eldoret, scanty people on the streets, too many empty parking space..no jam. It’s just a reflection of the 16% VAT on fuel effect; sadly devastating.
659 2018-09-14 11:20:11 Now you know why these Chinese men treat their Kenyan workers with contempt and even insult our leaders. We are just buy commodities they've bought.
660 2018-09-14 11:20:03 Paresh Rawal ji what matter is not how many people or parties support the bandh.

661 2018-09-14 11:16:32 VAT on petroleum products is unpopular even with 8% still commodities will be up
662 2018-09-14 11:16:06 La convertibilidad no te hace pobre. Es una politica monetaria que como regla tr quita el resorte del tipo de cambio para amortiguar los cambios externos.

663 2018-09-14 11:14:35 PRESIDENT Uhuru Kenyatta proposes to cut VAT on petroleum products from 16 per cent to 8 per cent; says he has listened to Kenyans' concerns over rising fuel prices. Instructions to lower prices of other commodities immediately

702 2018-09-14 08:06:34 You can start but whatever comes out as profit will be so small and would be eaten up by inflation when the person tries to lead a life with what comes out. My point is you can't actually do much with that amount due to the high cost of commodities.

726 2018-09-14 06:26:14 Tax from other commodities may also reduce. Siku hizi you hear people saying they have reduced consumption of X and Y because of VAT

733 2018-09-14 06:10:17 The way forward for us as a nation is a push in women's rights. Women must not be treated as commodities waiting to be disposed off because daddy is afraid they might fall in love. Respecting a woman's choice and encouraging them to study will definitely move our country forward.
734 2018-09-14 06:07:44 This is a lil bit problematic.We're not only losing 640php out of our 10K.When inflation goes up the prices of several commodities rise too(depending on how they r produced).Im sure it's not just 640php down d drain. 

How about those familes whose 10K budget is just enough?

742 2018-09-14 05:35:51 @Apple your products are so expensive that the majority middle class who would vie to own an iPhone would feel let down. A state where essential commodities such as fuel hike is being discouraged, you come up with phones costing over a lakh?
743 2018-09-14 05:30:45 Wow, I’m so glad they were able to get their remains returned safely! This whole event got me thinking more about how museums and their counterparts reduce material culture to commodities with specific economic values. Such a shame.
744 2018-09-14 05:29:46 But the ground reality is that prices of essential commodities r soaring high into the sky . Slowly becoming out of the reach of common man
745 2018-09-14 05:26:51 It makes it easier to control people. They’re the only active political party that sees other human beings as commodities. I think Pelosi and company are cyborgs. I know Feinstein is!

764 2018-09-14 03:36:35 Ela fez tudo sozinha? Economia caiu muito mais com a instabilidade  política que no governo dela.

765 2018-09-14 03:32:04 Unfortunately, some people in social media are arguing just for the sake of arguing (or winning the argument).. Most are middle-class folks who, in reality, wouldn’t be affected much by the inflation or increased in the prices of prime commodities..
766 2018-09-14 03:30:50 U seems to be in such hatred & anger that u don't what u r saying. U said u stopped paying GST without knowing that prices of all commodities which u buy includes GST. & If u r a businessman, even than u end up paying GST. U like to screw others, I like to unscrew others.
