3 2018-03-27 23:59:26 thanks for asking! so you render the fat by cooking bacon (you can use any fat or oil really), and pour it into a mason jar with the alcohol to sit, stirring now and then. let it sit for like 4-6 hours, then freeze the jar. the fat solidifies and you strain it out
4 2018-03-27 23:59:22 How did it go with the oil?
5 2018-03-27 23:59:19 The Gov of the day thought oil would stay at $130/barrel therefore it would fund MF without a struggle 2 taxpayers.

39 2018-03-27 23:56:13 Is there more to it than Syria? I mean the Syrian thing has been going on since the Reagan years. Plus I thought the EU was dependent on Russian oil? So why? The Euros don't care about Syria do they?
40 2018-03-27 23:56:05 This is my first time ordering them. I use tea tree oil often, but haven't yet delved into making my own mixes
41 2018-03-27 23:56:00 We swapped out our 3208 for a Cummins 6BT..best thing we ever did ...picked up 2 knots and we can re wheel and pick up another 2 if we want to ...not an ounce of trouble with the engine other than the oil pressure sender which triggers the alarm all the time
42 2018-03-27 23:55:43 Cooked up the remains of my dinner just now (rice noodles with oil and soy butter fried chicken in soup with some tamari). Added some seasoning and broke an egg into it, currently enjoying it with excess broth in a mug. Might do this again.

46 2018-03-27 23:54:59 Money has corrupted the entire political process. Big pharma, military industrial complex, oil subsidies & wars for oil, insurance co's and the NRA.  Our voices don't matter. If we vote with our wallets, than some have much louder "voices." Together we can be heard #Enough

51 2018-03-27 23:52:42 Paprika and garlic. I leave steak in bag with that for a few hours or even overnight, along with some ground nut oil (due to high smoke point). I take off garlic before cooking as frying it at the such a high hear will make it go burn/bitter. I salt just before cooking. Nom nom

53 2018-03-27 23:52:35 That's one good idea. He also recently published an article on nationalizing oil companies. This is basically unrelated to where existing environmentalist organizing is focusing (opposition to fracking and pipelines). It just feels unfocused, I guess.

61 2018-03-27 23:52:00 I guess the next step will be to attempt to eliminate Russian influence in Ukraine and Syria. Install the puppets and make a grab for the oil and gas.

67 2018-03-27 23:50:36 Glad to see you tell the current Nigerian government that the true resource of the nation is the people and not the Oil or whatsoever mineral. Many thanks for all you do! Thanks for caring about Africa, especially Nigeria.
68 2018-03-27 23:50:33 Well. I spilled a little hot oil on me and my personal computer is broken and so many important things have gone wrong since break started. Trying to stay positive hoping things will change 
69 2018-03-27 23:50:14 No 
@MarleySpoon. This is our first box. They already told us they omitted the bread for another dish and they forgot the scallions for the scallion sauce tonight and used a SAT word where it wasn’t necessary and the oil got too hot (“shimmer” vs “simmer”)

78 2018-03-27 23:48:22 That time in 1998 during the Workd Cup when I almost died from food poisoning springs to mind. The culprit was mussels in oil...ended up in hospital and nearly popped me clogs...

80 2018-03-27 23:47:30 Actually tastes great! No sugar, but good sweetness from banana and coconut oil.
81 2018-03-27 23:47:28 Teeth and hockey players go together about as well as oil and water.

104 2018-03-27 23:43:20 We can’t reach our greenhouse gas omissions goals because we have a petrol buck. our whole economy is based on oil sands. it  pretty much. Pays for everything. Devils bargain.  we get to live a good life while everyone else has to deal with  climate change.
105 2018-03-27 23:43:19 dude mine grew out of NOWHERE. Don't use heat, just try to scrunch it or put it in a cute bun to style it. I've been using an Argan oil spray & heat protectant when I use heat. Do a coconut hair mask about twice a week and 10000mg biotin should do the trick in a couple mons!
106 2018-03-27 23:43:01 You make a lot of implications.

118 2018-03-27 23:41:09 Fine. The rest of Canada obviously doesn't need Alberta's oil money. Therefore, Alberta can keep all their own money. I'm good with that.
119 2018-03-27 23:40:49 except for the clensing oil i literaly use this when im in the shower so its perfect to wash off and my pores open up bc of the heat! i hope it works for you!!

128 2018-03-27 23:39:44 She's wise and knows, many are pro wahabi while it goes against our religion. How are we oppressing women while our prophet(pbuh) gave women so many rights and was pro women? KSA is not what it used to be, the kingdom has ruined it and they spread cancer when oil was found.
129 2018-03-27 23:39:44 We need to dry the source of money that goes to Assad and the source is Iran’s oil money. Iran’s oil embargo would soon cripple Mullahs and as a result Assad’s massacring Syrians.
#regime change in Iran under leadership of #RezaPahlavi is the only answer to this chaos.
130 2018-03-27 23:39:20 I get bad reactions to opioids and can only take them in cases of serious injury, but it feels nearly the same with all the other meds and methods I use. I wait until I’m in probably too much pain. CBD oil and other modalities are promising, I wish you luck and wellness

138 2018-03-27 23:38:04 i loved mine until 2-3 weeks passed by. they got really crusty and hard and itchy and i would brush them and put baby oil on every day! once the glue is like mid lash instead of lash line it sucks :( i took them out last night and i look naked

140 2018-03-27 23:37:41 Sadly muslim parents in Texas beat and poured hot oil on their daughter for refusing to enter into an arranged marriage.
141 2018-03-27 23:37:14 OU faculty, staff & students need to question the OU Board of Regents about its selection process & its final Pres decision w/out ANY OU community input. Not surprised BofR hired a Big Oil exec in place of a select, well-regarded academic administrator but truly devastated. Sick.

144 2018-03-27 23:37:06 My favorite essential oil is Wendy’s Baconator
145 2018-03-27 23:37:05 Haha.  Those pusscakes would shit their pants at the sight.
146 2018-03-27 23:36:58 Is any sick among you?  Let him call  for the elders of the church : and let them pray over him,  anointing him with oil in d name of d Lord
147 2018-03-27 23:36:45 TRUMP is about to waste money a parade! I think the public has a right to know how the military spends their money! How much republicans make including their pay under the table for special favors, like the NRA,  oil  and coal companies, etc. Money should go to veterans!
148 2018-03-27 23:36:37 Yaass that oil sweet
149 2018-03-27 23:36:28 19 years of democracy plus hundreds of billions of US dollar in oil revenue. Electricity production is still at under 7,000MW
150 2018-03-27 23:36:26 seal them with an oil.
whatever style you do, make sure not to manipulate the ends too much
151 2018-03-27 23:36:21 Atrazine and oil will cause leaf tip burn on hot humid days
152 2018-03-27 23:36:00 Tough one. In a taste test, I’m sure I’d taste the difference... but this one has no palm oil, which is good for the orangutans. But the artificial sweetener will likely kill me sooner. 
In conclusion, Nutella is very very good.
153 2018-03-27 23:35:48 Nah, I'll pass. I got my own douchebaggery to deal with. Better a meat sack than a ball sack! TTFN!
154 2018-03-27 23:35:42 in the last 24 hours ive started diffusing rosemary essential oil as my go-to instead of lemongrass and i would just like 2 say the differences are astronomical

156 2018-03-27 23:35:21 Running low on sea salt & essential oil 
157 2018-03-27 23:35:17 I'm really sick of this shit.

If we switched to renewables, we could prioritize the asia trade route and let the middle east handle itself.

Nooo... Oil giants have to have their profits.

174 2018-03-27 23:31:58 There is no other product that is used in so many delivery forms.

Press board panels, tobacco, oil's & soaps, paper, fabric, & then there is the medical field:
Pain, antiinflammatory, constipation, antioxidant, skin conditions, diabetes, constipation, etc.
175 2018-03-27 23:31:56 You don’t think Bush and the Globalist GOP weeent working together with the media and oil companies during Desert Storm On up??
176 2018-03-27 23:31:50 A hypothesis based on limited available facts is not a conclusion. But yeah, the more aesthetically pleasing hypothesis is probably that it was sabotage by Big Oil and Teh Shortz.
177 2018-03-27 23:31:34 I know I am like a billion years older than you but seriously.....?   You got out wearing track suit trousers and a fake fur man made fiber coat (made from oil scum turned into MM fabrics) and look at the colour co-ordinations have you gone colour blind? FFS
178 2018-03-27 23:31:25 Dinosaurs are apex predators even in death, as through oil pollution and wars over oil, dinosaurs are still raking up an impressive killcount despite being extinct for millions of years.

180 2018-03-27 23:30:40 Some of us have a really hard time finding sunscreens that dont irritate the skin or need constant reapplying and leave you looking like you stuck your face ina vat of oil. Point is make up isnt always for someone elses benefit and a lot of it is societal expectation and pressure
181 2018-03-27 23:30:24 Life Hack: if you stir a small amount of coconut oil into your kale, it will be easier to scrape off your plate
182 2018-03-27 23:30:08 Venezuela had a high standard of living, had a vibrant economy and produced much more than just oil.  Capitalism has brought more people out of misery and poverty than anything else ever tried.  People did not emigrate from Venezuela, they immigrated to it before socialism.

186 2018-03-27 23:29:49 And coco need an oil change 
187 2018-03-27 23:29:40 That has castor oil inside
188 2018-03-27 23:29:38 Ah, the age old dilemma - do you take it to the dealer and wait 4 hours for an oil change, or take it to jiffy lube and get it back in 30 mins with no new oil and a missing cap?
189 2018-03-27 23:29:38 I'm not holding it much hope, this is the same organisation that still hasn't cleaned up the Lea, six weeks after the drastic oil spill and has now opened the locks and removed the booms so it's spreading again.

204 2018-03-27 23:28:00 Grapes must be crushed to make wine! Diamonds form under pressure! Olives are pressed to release oil! Seeds grow in darkness! Moral of the story, when you feel crushed, under pressure, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation!

209 2018-03-27 23:27:11 Isn’t your car new? They should have to deal with it. I’m actually at Ford right now to get an oil change & haven’t had any issues with them, but I wouldn’t buy my next car from them. My friend & her husband are in the middle of a lawsuit with them!
210 2018-03-27 23:27:04 @D_Glaze does dishes, sweeping and vacuuming usually. Today he mowed the lawn, cleaned out cars, changed their oil and is making dinner but will still do dishes afterward so I can go back to cleaning. He's usually a pretty good teammate...he just hates I do this! LOL!

226 2018-03-27 23:24:39 I've been in Lucas oil in Indy and it has the same thing. I should have known I'd freak.
227 2018-03-27 23:24:35 He may not have all of it, but he has too much.

For one thing, he shouldn't be maintaining a massive state owned oil company.
228 2018-03-27 23:24:21 You use grapeseed oil?
229 2018-03-27 23:24:02 A few pictures of the tanker truck incident on KY 32 this afternoon. The truck was carrying approximately 180 barrels of crude oil at the time of the accident. Luckily no product escaped the truck during the incident.

231 2018-03-27 23:23:48 BC tourism generates more economic activity, creates more jobs and adds more to our GDP than the entire oil and gas sector.

We should be promoting clean tourism jobs not dirty fossil fuel jobs.   #bcpoli #StopKM

237 2018-03-27 23:21:32 Under the Skin (2013) is creepy because it offers a vision of an alien method of ingestion that is virtually beyond human comprehension. Half-spider web, half-black oil slick, the method is the stuff of nightmare rendered visual palpable. Its terror lingers in the imagination.
238 2018-03-27 23:21:23 I'm definitely overdue for a oil change  if it ain't one thing its another .
239 2018-03-27 23:21:22 You can dilute with a carrier oil and rub onto their feet, also behind ears and on pressure points. Be sure to dilute oils with a carrier oil (sunflower oil, almond oil etc)

245 2018-03-27 23:20:47 If you actually take car of your vehicle (yearly maintenance/regular oil changes) it’ll last for a VERY LONG TIME, but apparently some people don’t understand this 
246 2018-03-27 23:20:33 A) Not taxpayer money.  B) if giving money to a state sponsor of terrorism disqualifies one from being a Christian, then we haven’t had a Christian president since the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia.
247 2018-03-27 23:20:23 Good eating time. Forgot Not at jobing overout Energy ist as Drive a Car without oil.

248 2018-03-27 23:20:22 Venezuela remains one of the richest oil countries, but everyone there is starving or else eating their pets, thanks to hardcore socialism.
249 2018-03-27 23:20:21 You’ll be fine! Lmaooo just don’t let these oil change ppl scam you!
250 2018-03-27 23:20:16 Looks like it’s a PFI owned & run by Mitie

There will be a serious amount of negotiation & backroom deals to help oil the transfer

£s & £s, but no one will ever know because despite it being taxpayers money, everyone involved will say it’s commercially sensitive
251 2018-03-27 23:20:11 I need Chick-fil-A to stop cooking in peanut oil soon
252 2018-03-27 23:20:00 Well, it's really the money of the Russian people.  Putin steals the country's natural resource (oil, gas, etc.) lining his/oligarch's pockets.
253 2018-03-27 23:19:58 demand for one type of oil vs another could be the issue.

283 2018-03-27 23:16:03 So my mom uses Magnesium Oil as a deodorant. It’s a roller ball style thing, I use it on the bottoms of my feet after work but my mom swears it works just as well on the pits too. I need to give up the anti-perspirant life but I just hate smelling -____-
284 2018-03-27 23:16:01 It’s important to keep in mind that a well-seasoned pan is covered in polymer, not oil (ref Cantor etc). You have to work to damage the polymer, like a _long_ cook with highly acidic stuff or scraping with steel wool.
285 2018-03-27 23:15:44 There was definitely some retribution votes for the look in the mirror comment. To be fair though, that Notley post came long before the oil price collapse and subsequent recession
286 2018-03-27 23:15:43 Let punishment fit the crime. If a murderer you die. If you pour hot oil on anyone, perhaps same for you.
287 2018-03-27 23:15:24 Doing great, a bit exhausted but great, just need a drop of oil and it will be even better :) how are things at your end? Back back to 'normal'?
288 2018-03-27 23:15:11 I understand you dont set the pricing however as a Government agency surely you would have the power to see that servce stations are supplying fuel at world oil barrel stock prices and not simply price gouging Australian consumers
289 2018-03-27 23:15:00 One reason,  we're in ongoing conflicts all the time burning our national treasure, killing our young men who serve, all for oil.  That's right Iraq was about oil not WAD's. While we've been diminishing ourselves in endless wars our foes (China,Rus) have not. #Madness
290 2018-03-27 23:14:58 The Hot Chili Oil is even more coveted.
291 2018-03-27 23:14:39 No wayyy alright so imma do a test for a month with castor oil and the serum and see which works best
292 2018-03-27 23:14:23 add oil
293 2018-03-27 23:14:23 I am no expert in oil production, but my cousin in Alberta informs me that they have greatly reduced their output due to lack of demand. Again my buddy offshore here in NL says he can't see how this plan to double output here will ever work.
294 2018-03-27 23:14:18 So my grandma put this rosemary oil mixture on my scalp 
I kind of smell like an Italian restaurant but my scalp doesn’t itch
295 2018-03-27 23:14:16 I use those in there when the oil is running out lol

It's none of there  business why don't they worry about politicians getting kick backs,north Korea, kids getting shot in schools, China, oil companies in prices for charging,
298 2018-03-27 23:13:52 awesome! i usually just use it for my body  tea tree oil is good for your face too! for breakouts/moisture 
299 2018-03-27 23:13:40 @FrankHowarth and @drunkenwood   How good does danish oil finish look on redwood and walnut?
300 2018-03-27 23:13:32 It is but.....damn I miss having a $20 oil change
301 2018-03-27 23:13:27 Short sighted of any government to follow his advice but considering that WM Governments have always been in the back pocket of the oil companies not perhaps as innocently stupid as viewed today. Electrification was coming fast
302 2018-03-27 23:13:23 Guess which type of Olive Oil I am
303 2018-03-27 23:13:18 People who voted “no,” hate Muslims, and believe Dutton about African gangs and white farmers also happen to believe in miracle cancer cures, the damaging effects of canola oil on the brain, and bottled water recalls due to transparent worm infestations. Who knew?
304 2018-03-27 23:13:17 As I was born in Feb 75 in Coventry, Id have to say a Jaguar XJS with average mileage, tan seats and a slight oil leak approaching a major service and a cam belt change.

315 2018-03-27 23:11:02 You can find in youtube many recipes in “papillote”. You can also do it using foil paper; the key is using layers, don’t put much oil/butter as everything will be cooked in their own juices.

320 2018-03-27 23:10:34 I was using rosehip oil, but I ran out. Grape seed oil helps also... and one of this things I wash my face with is lemongrass soap. You have to be patient and consistent tho lol

336 2018-03-27 23:08:10 Girl I don’t believe in that crap, castor oil is literally the way to go. You know it’s legit cause my grandma called from Syria and told me to use it 
337 2018-03-27 23:08:05 Reply 1/n: Strategy! Strategy! West’s need to protect strategic oil, Israel foreign policy lobbying continues efforts to topple Assad, weaken Iran at any cost. If it uproots generations in middle east, does not matter as Americans are too far away to feel the heat.
338 2018-03-27 23:07:56 Oh my goodness I bought like eight oil paint tubes for $48 do you know how chEAP that is when each tube’s original price was like $13!!!! I got each for $3 bc they were messy but ahghhthgjg I’m so happy

342 2018-03-27 23:07:19 @LithiaMedford What is your definition of Quick Lube? Every time I come in for an oil change, it takes well over an hour. I once was here for more than three hours with no update along the way. Put a bit of hustle in your step.
343 2018-03-27 23:07:16 Given that a significant number of "polities with hereditary leaders, but (whose) monarch is not tightly constrained" would be Gulf states, have the huge benefits from the oil boom (which would have nothing to do with the nature of polity) been factored into the calculations?
344 2018-03-27 23:07:12 I reported @EnergyInDepth to @Twitter even though it was a promoted ad because the promotion was used to personally attack A politician who is trying to sue the oil companies for their 60 years of killing people with their pollution.
345 2018-03-27 23:06:56 My mother called me the other day to ask if you can put CBD oil in a juul.... Lol that is all
346 2018-03-27 23:06:49 Rest my case for now Mr. @BillGates just raised an issue that has long been in my heart. We focus too much on oil when simple quick measures can be taken with our people in focus...I return back to prayer mode

348 2018-03-27 23:06:43 Exactly, decreasing the rates two times in 2015 to help oil sector (∼ 6% of GDP) mainly resulted in the bubbly growth of Canada housing sector (∼15% to 20% of GDP) and the rapid increase of the household debts!

351 2018-03-27 23:06:23 Y'all - I can build a combustible engine off water. This is why I am forcing Mitch to legalize Hemp. If yu add 'Hemp Leaves' or any other type of wood or grass to the engine, it will weight itself like Olive Oil. It could get over 100mpg & water & a photon can produce heat. #Bell
352 2018-03-27 23:06:20 No. That money already exists and ain't tied to production. It's not dropping 4 trillion out of thin air!!! It's taking 4 trillion from oil companies and landlords and giving it to everyone. Landlords, land speculators, and people who monopolize oil fields are non-productive.
353 2018-03-27 23:06:14 I am a little skeptical about increasing the output of oil over the next number of years. A buddy of mine works offshore and he says it's not that simple.
354 2018-03-27 23:06:01 My God I haven't really talked about it yet but holy shit I am so glad Ethan is still on this planet fUCK YOU PEANUT OIL

359 2018-03-27 23:05:33 Big Oil already has disproportionate influence in Oklahoma.  This isn’t a forwards looking appointment.

Hopefully if I paint next 
Its gonna come out right
361 2018-03-27 23:05:27 Can you change the oil while you’re under there? Thanks.
362 2018-03-27 23:05:25 So you hate the 1st. Gotcha. You lead tainted snake oil salesman really like to get these gullible #maga #dupes in a frenzy. Sells more lead tainted snake oil. Fear is big business.

366 2018-03-27 23:04:53 So my dr has asked some of his most complex patients to trial CBD oil for him in secret (whoops x) but cba to actually see me, he decided to ask over e-mail so that he doesnt have to do work on the wards or in the check up unit... ffs
367 2018-03-27 23:04:52 Hell, maybe even 40. We still haven't gotten to the "We should nationalize the oil companies" stage yet.
368 2018-03-27 23:04:37 Tell me what our deficit is when we are independent. Kevin Hague admitted he didn’t know on radio. Oil price is good & profits way up as production costs more than halved. Food exports booming. What will we not be paying when we’re Indy?
369 2018-03-27 23:04:09 I am very proud of my gf who took it upon herself to understand a thing or two about cars. She’s actually getting it. We went to top her oil off and she tried to do it herself. It was so cute

406 2018-03-27 22:59:43 thinking again.  Wonder how many kids today know how to change oil, change a flat or how to check ANY fluid in their car?  A new Kia does not come with jack or donut tire unless u pay for it.  Is that because they don't know how to use them?
407 2018-03-27 22:59:40 or coconut oil

How many anointing oil did Jeff Bezos drink, you make him the world richest man?

415 2018-03-27 22:57:53 While I understand why these ingredients would work together, this sounds revolting.

I'd rather eat a pill of the oil (like having a cod liver oil pill) and just have my fucking proper coffee with a fat in my breakfast, which I need to absorb my prescribed supplements anyway
416 2018-03-27 22:57:51 Which is why all gun owners should tweet #Repeal2A.  It will kill the movement.
417 2018-03-27 22:57:38 Hormonal acne sufferer here: try squalene oil. Its a game changer.
418 2018-03-27 22:57:32 @CKAMINSKY_27, you guys doing any oval test at Lucas Oil Raceway?
419 2018-03-27 22:57:27 rationally I know my stomach only hurts because of the metric ton of olive oil I put in my pasta for dinner but I can not help but think I’m dying from some fatal disease
420 2018-03-27 22:57:09 I’ve tried Mario Badescu and my face was just oil it was bad so I stopped using it, but origins that stuff does wonders!
421 2018-03-27 22:57:02 Oil cleansing is great for makeup. I tend to use to it when I've got makeup. Otherwise it's just cleanse and tone as usual at night. :)!
422 2018-03-27 22:56:52 Yes! more middle eastern oil!
423 2018-03-27 22:56:43 Went to hobby lobby for a tube of white oil paint. $65 later...  your girl seriously needs help.
424 2018-03-27 22:56:38 I'm excited to go home, wash my hair and massage my scalp with my new lavender jamaican black castor oil. 
425 2018-03-27 22:56:32 Goes in for an oil change and comes back a right off
426 2018-03-27 22:56:25 We're doing it.  We are buying a gun. Never thought I'd say that.
427 2018-03-27 22:56:25 As a #vegan, I have to say, #tahini has become my new best friend for making creamy pasta sauces. Just add salt, pepper, garlic, cayenne pepper, and olive oil. Absolutely #delicious!
428 2018-03-27 22:56:23 Me: omg that smells so good what did you just do?
@TyCobb12 :I put oil in a pot...
429 2018-03-27 22:56:12 Oil isn't subsidized? Get educated, my friend.
430 2018-03-27 22:56:10 There was oil in Afghanistan?
431 2018-03-27 22:56:04 Dinosaurs are apex predators even in death, as through oil pollution and wars over oil, dinosaurs are still raking up an impressive killcount despite being extinct for millions of years.
432 2018-03-27 22:56:00 @APPropst Because people like trips like these, and demand them, as they cut out connecting flights, would they stop the flights if oil prices rise and they are no longer profitable?
433 2018-03-27 22:55:43 i put mayo , egg yolk , olive oil , honey , and avocado in my hair my afro looks so good right now i at first thought i'd regret using this but it truly works shout out those random ass posts i see on my tl
434 2018-03-27 22:55:43 私も昔夜中に突然木を彫りたくなり彫刻刀でカマボコの板を彫っていたら左手中指をざっくり。あと少しで指先の肉が取れるとこでしたこういうのがあると便利ですね
435 2018-03-27 22:55:38 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. And the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. #MEGA #MAGA
436 2018-03-27 22:55:23 never in an african home, we are downing 5 bottles of goya oil and back to sender prayers on that window

438 2018-03-27 22:54:36 So many saints are worried about how much money they make, or what they'll get in regards to what God has for them. 

Wealth? 

Let me remind you that God gave that woman at Zarepheth JUST ENOUGH meal and oil for a day to last the famine. 

Sometimes a lot is measure by a little.
439 2018-03-27 22:54:33 Day 1 of coconut oil pulling. I will let you know the results in a month & if you should do it! :)
440 2018-03-27 22:54:24 Yup no oil no money no worth! But u must agree that the former KGB operative (Putin) is not the innocent person he claims to be

442 2018-03-27 22:53:41 Plus Maralago could get a little oil on it and we certainly can't have that.
443 2018-03-27 22:53:35 if you are washing your makeup brushes with straight up coconut oil PLS stop
444 2018-03-27 22:53:15 I eat my white boiled yam with palm oil, salt, and pepper.
445 2018-03-27 22:53:05 I dropped my car off for a new tire and oil change at 2:30pm, and it’s still not ready. I’m literally the last one here and it’s 6:52pm. 
446 2018-03-27 22:52:58 i’m getting an oil change and fixing my tire all while having a smoke and a beer. 

this is how you adult properly.
447 2018-03-27 22:52:56 So I'm readying up on it, and a common issue .... That been oil really smells
448 2018-03-27 22:52:53 Mira el mensaje que te mande es super importante es vida o muerte
449 2018-03-27 22:52:33 Put a skillet (copper bottom or cast iron are best) with a brushed layer of olive oil on the range (gas works best) at high heat.  When the oil starts to smoke put the scallops in and sear for 90 seconds on each side.  Done.
450 2018-03-27 22:52:30 When we're riding high, we're the evil energy core who happens to help pay for the rest of the country

When we're in bust, it's our fault and how dare we feel bad because, according to plenty of people from Ontario & BC, we're all rich oil barons who just didn't plan ahead
451 2018-03-27 22:52:30 Man my coworker said he’s gonna try and get me a job with his wife it’s in oil and gas and they’re hiring for a position I’m qualified for. She started in that position and now makes over 110k a year. I would DIE if I ever made that much
452 2018-03-27 22:52:29 me too
453 2018-03-27 22:52:25 Oil paint*** not lol paint. 
454 2018-03-27 22:52:07 Okkkkkkkk! Even The Baby Oil One Still Gotta Weird Smell
455 2018-03-27 22:52:03 ปวดหัววะ
456 2018-03-27 22:51:51 Never thought me and my mother would bond over using marijuana oil as a moisturiser
457 2018-03-27 22:51:43 And she blames it on the fact that we are still driving to work. 1) The oil is headed to China, not my car. 2) Then they need to invest in effective public transit, NOT pipelines!
458 2018-03-27 22:51:42 Nope
459 2018-03-27 22:51:30 i’m boutta make some glow oil.

461 2018-03-27 22:51:16 The Oriental Market on Payne Ave. is great. Just got some free Ginger Root with the purchase of some Hoisin Sauce and Seseme Oil. Highly recommend it!
462 2018-03-27 22:51:07 Yes, Japan attacked us because we'd choked off their oil supplies. It wasn't like they just one day thought, "Hey, you know what would be fun? War with the US."
463 2018-03-27 22:50:58 I’m gonna get you some lavender oil
464 2018-03-27 22:50:52 I'd love to have it on 70 but oil, like everything else on this friggin island, costs a ton.
465 2018-03-27 22:50:47 Also worth reading The Big Rich, incredible history of Texas Oil Money including the Hunt Brothers attempt at cornering the Silver Market
466 2018-03-27 22:50:26 Good for them, bad for you lol. I just was getting my car inspected and they asked me a question about my oil
467 2018-03-27 22:50:20 If we boiled Mikey moore’s fat ass and extracted the oil, we would never again have a energy crisis !
468 2018-03-27 22:50:12 He is, actually.
469 2018-03-27 22:50:03 $45 for an oil change  Driving a foreign is too much sometimes
470 2018-03-27 22:50:01 Don’t forget the benefits of CBD oil
471 2018-03-27 22:50:00 More short term I think the Saudis are overly optimistic about the effect a war with Iran will have on their oil industry.
472 2018-03-27 22:49:37 Girl I was right there with you! Try sex and primrose oil
473 2018-03-27 22:48:44 It’s crazy what can happen in a 30 min oil change at the shop
474 2018-03-27 22:48:29 Retweeted Elizabeth Crisp (@elizabethcrisp):

@JPMorrell @sharonhewitt, who worked on an oil rig as a Shell engineer, says she doesn't think more regulation needed to close pay gap: "What we need are more women -- more women in higher paying careers." #lalege #lagov
475 2018-03-27 22:48:28 Syria obstructed the Qatar to Turkey pipeline. I think the others just started dealing oil in gold.
476 2018-03-27 22:48:28 Mick Cornett will do the exact same thing for the oil and gas industry he is the same old same do not allow this to continue do not vote for Mick Cornett.

478 2018-03-27 22:48:18 Neither of us are oil paintings are we
479 2018-03-27 22:48:09 I love finding promoted tweets for like, the oil industry, and going in to find everyone and their mother roasting them.
480 2018-03-27 22:48:05 "These people" you duped are so quick to frothing at the mouth, first this was a op/ed meaning it was an opinion piece. Second UK white nationalist, agoraphobic and snake oil salesman Paul really knows how to get you hacks in a frenzy over nothing.
481 2018-03-27 22:48:04 tea tree oil, castor oil, lemon/lemon essential oil, shea butter, apple cider vinegar, honey, tumeric - all these products could literally solve all your problems it’s great
482 2018-03-27 22:47:48 As a vegan I can’t own fish as I can’t kill them even when close to death, can’t get hold of clove oil at 23:30 and can’t face personally decapitating or pithing, put it in separate tub within tank & if nature doesn’t run its course overnight other will do the deed
483 2018-03-27 22:47:42 Peppermint oil on your temples can help a lot.
484 2018-03-27 22:47:39 Ylang Ylang essential oil always having me feeling the essence of extraterrestrial realms.
485 2018-03-27 22:47:36 Yes ginger biscuits I find help and also lavender oil in a room burner thingy
486 2018-03-27 22:47:32 For all his bluster Trump is so easy to read.

Trump never could have made it in publicly traded Corp 

He's an exceptionally poor actor.

Trump's just a  oil salesman from a bygone era.

When  gets Trump & RW out of power we can start progressing again as a country.

491 2018-03-27 22:47:09 oil pulling is disgusting, how am I supposed to do this for 20 minutes I want to gag
492 2018-03-27 22:47:06 Stick to NGL, H2 isn't a fuel.  H2 means energy distribution which they want to control, not grid connected vehicles.  Electrification is more versatile in generation sources, magnitudes more efficient, and over time won't need oil companies.  Moving Freight Without Oil (2005)
493 2018-03-27 22:46:57 My truck was 6 thousands miles overdue for an oil change. Finally had time to do it 
494 2018-03-27 22:46:51 I think so too... 
I cross people over in the weirdest places as well as sense other *energy* around me.
I was told to put Cedar Oil in my shoes to keep wandering *energy* from attaching...
495 2018-03-27 22:46:48 You do realize it would be you against the government, and not you against me? 

I don’t need beard oil to know you’d fall like autumn leaves.
496 2018-03-27 22:46:46 Not just oil changes, literally for everything 
497 2018-03-27 22:46:40 So queasy :( oil is the worst.
498 2018-03-27 22:46:37 It’s so much oil in my hair it’s crazy 
499 2018-03-27 22:46:35 Just kidding, that was hemlock, hemp is just an herbal oil.
500 2018-03-27 22:46:13 Is that ALL palm oil /  Educate me please.  And I have noticed that Palm oil is in everything.  Source of the palm oils in question ?
501 2018-03-27 22:45:46 My cousin started putting neem oil in her navel daily and her skin is glowing . A natural healer recommended
502 2018-03-27 22:45:13 Ok so I think I'm ready to say that sesame oil may be the superior oil
503 2018-03-27 22:44:40 You are so on point.
504 2018-03-27 22:44:31 Just told someone today to stop their fish oil
505 2018-03-27 22:44:30 The refineries are being used for storage and transfer but the machinery is still there I read in a 2016 report. David Black said he's been trying to get Alta gov and oil companies to reconfigure for 4 years but no movement.
506 2018-03-27 22:44:19 Amazing Cleansing oil. Love Kiehl's
507 2018-03-27 22:44:12 yeah, crying. now i have to put coconut oil on them from 1-6 months or until they grow back
508 2018-03-27 22:44:09 Go to hell. Not another war for oil. No more young men to die for republican/bolton s lies.
509 2018-03-27 22:44:08 Damn, what if I wasn't trying to be positive??? Boiled in oil by "tiger", I guess!!
510 2018-03-27 22:43:50 Kiss my Azz you tree  huggers. Got off their oil and gas 
511 2018-03-27 22:43:48 gonna go chug some lavender essential oil to calm myself down
512 2018-03-27 22:43:47 Just threw oil in my car ...
513 2018-03-27 22:43:37 Wondering if any justices make it very political to limit further administrative proceedings in other areas. I also think oil states loses and they keep the ptab abomination.

515 2018-03-27 22:43:19 Consider yourself lucky- we've been paying $1.53-1.55 for 2 weeks in Vancity with the Alberta pipeline passing oil right through our backyard & being exported to Asia.
516 2018-03-27 22:43:18 I just had a slice of goat cheese & truffle oil pizza
517 2018-03-27 22:43:14 I did an adult thing and got my oil changed in my car yesterday and they asked me what one I wanted to do semi synthetic or synthetic and I looked at them like wtf? That was a moment I needed my dad hahahahahaha
518 2018-03-27 22:43:00 $XOM is dead money here and with higher refinancing costs picking the best oil play is a tough one ... when loose monetary conditions tighten something like Exxon happens ... reality check
519 2018-03-27 22:42:50 When I was with the Oil Kings, we were always giving the media free stuff. Was I doing it wrong?
520 2018-03-27 22:42:30 I put my beauty blenders in a container with water as hot as the faucet will get, castor or anti bacterial soap, and coconut oil. Shake it for 5 mins, then rinse and repeat. Works like a charm.
521 2018-03-27 22:42:28 no because you can measure the drugs in an athlete's system and actually quantify the effects. You can't measure/quantify the effects CA's snake oil had on voters. If anything, it seems it doesn't have an effect on elections.
522 2018-03-27 22:42:18 อยากเลียให้บ้างจังอ่ะ
523 2018-03-27 22:42:14 Like  how you expect just vitamin c oil is the only form of moisturizer you gonna use and u have a whole bunch at your home. How does that make sense
524 2018-03-27 22:42:09 Yes yes, that wouldn't have anything to do with Saudi increasing production but would it? 
Oil is bonus. Tell one thing Scotland can't do out of the uk.
525 2018-03-27 22:42:05 How is the scheme for unemployed oil workers Kevin?
526 2018-03-27 22:41:39 The day hasn't been smooth, but I wore my patchouli mixed with the immitation Ed Hardy oil and it works pretty well with my chemistry <3 Love this new scent :-)
527 2018-03-27 22:41:30 If the Oil didn't have Hockey McJesus, they would likely be this year's version of the 2016/17 Avs - and it wouldn't be close. I'd be happy to see @cmcdavid97 win the Art Ross - it's a proxy 'best player in the league' trophy anyway.
528 2018-03-27 22:41:27 The notebook I used was almost lost during my chocolate olive oil cake disaster. But we both bounced back and now it smells like chocolate
529 2018-03-27 22:41:18 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
530 2018-03-27 22:41:18 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
531 2018-03-27 22:41:04 I’m cooking with coconut oil and the pan smells like hand cream. 
532 2018-03-27 22:40:55 気分を害したのならｽﾏﾇ　1/1ぬいぐるみという手もあr
533 2018-03-27 22:40:49 Waiting for when the politics of oil and gas will start among the Arctic council, since they are all powerful and industrial nations. Only US that is not a signatory to UNCLOS. 

Man will always go to “war” over resources.
534 2018-03-27 22:40:46 So, uhhh...we have an oil leak, need a new tire, and get the alignment corrected. Jerry is gunna be pissed 
535 2018-03-27 22:40:44 Oh wait that's outstanding long term debt .. Sorry but im not a fan of the $XLE ETF oil majors and mid caps have a debt burden to carry ..  nasty
536 2018-03-27 22:40:31 でもウルフってちょっとカッコいいよなーあっいや一番カッコいいのはハンターだけどな！
537 2018-03-27 22:40:23 Depends on how worn your tyres are and how much you lean on the corners, I usually find that I put in my best Strava times in the wet, almost two years ago I went for a ride in rain so heavy it washed the oil off my chain, one of my best rides :)
538 2018-03-27 22:40:13 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
539 2018-03-27 22:40:10 And hates oil.  I'll take the other side of that.
540 2018-03-27 22:40:08 Good News our CBD Oil without THC is coming out in a few weeks I will be letting you all know as soon as it is available :)
541 2018-03-27 22:39:31 Your way ahead of me buddy. Did change the oil in the boat. All my stuff is just like my last trip in late November. Thinking about moving on it though. Lol 
542 2018-03-27 22:39:09 Japan posed no threat to the United States until we decided to choke off their oil supplies. And for that matter, England and France might have avoided war with Germany if they'd said "Okay, take Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe; not our problem"
543 2018-03-27 22:39:03 Your right they are all Oil Wars
544 2018-03-27 22:38:57 Guess I'll take my baby to get a oil change and a tune up Friday morning.
545 2018-03-27 22:38:55 When will we do a audit on fuel cost in this country.few yrs  ago barrel oil cost $120 /pump price$1.30today $65/pump $1,32????? Why
546 2018-03-27 22:38:55 Lily, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
547 2018-03-27 22:38:53 @RedTRaccoon The military nor Mexico nor anybody with any common sense will. It's all a sham . Any money he gets under the guise of making America "Great" will be stolen from us.  He cares very little about America. Tried to drill oil on Publin land. Thank the Judge 4 stopping it
548 2018-03-27 22:38:52 PurClemsondue, How you feeling about turning 37 in June? Well, I think I just pulled a hip flexor saving a bottle of olive oil from falling of the counter.....so not great.
549 2018-03-27 22:38:50 God gave us the sun and wind, it is free energy, oil and gas were sealed beneath the ground by God to protect us, we broke that seal and global warming is the result, the cost of reclaiming carbon from air will be significant. Jesus gave health care to all for free, but we don't.
550 2018-03-27 22:38:49 Exactly! I could make em In any tin & in any oil .. long as oven is good & that batter mix & they get mega big & fluffy & melt in ur mouth .. Yum get in ma belly .. hungry now jeez

555 2018-03-27 22:37:38 Seriously how far are we getting hit in crypto market, are we still drilling oil?
556 2018-03-27 22:37:20 Ever heard of the cliche "Burning the midnight oil". Thats the secret of  success. 
Don't worry about thanking me. You are most welcome.
557 2018-03-27 22:37:05 The best thing about having a boyfriend that’s into mechanics is I never have to deal with taking my car to a shop and he looks so cute doing my oil changes or planning out all the things he wants to do to my car

564 2018-03-27 22:36:01 Yo sé que a las empresas de bondi le importa un orto cómo viajamos. Pero ese gas oil quemado que entra y se respira todo el viaje nos va a matar. Media pila. Todos los bondis viejos re mil queman. ¿Un arreglo ni siquiera?
565 2018-03-27 22:35:56 You should come on my fishing trip to Maine with me and have the shoestring fries one of my guides make during our shore lunch. Hand cut with a pocket knife, fried in a gallon of oil. Delicious.
566 2018-03-27 22:35:53 Our gov't takes money from SS funds to start wars, etc. They say they can't afford to pay us more yet they vote for crap like tax cuts for the wealthy and the gas/oil industry. Many disabled Americans are forced into poverty, some of them former military. This is not right!
567 2018-03-27 22:35:32 I got curious because I know them blacks, and I know them ex Confederate slaveowners, and I been a long time seeing these carpetbaggers door to door selling whatnot and panacea snake oil, and if there's anything I done study with interest, it be the whiteboy.

598 2018-03-27 22:30:07 Wrong! Its the Danish state who did this, not just a “company”. Secondly, the oil and gas is still harvested, but now by others hired by the State. Further using bio renewables just extract carbon from farmland, leaving food production in danger....

636 2018-03-27 22:24:02 Yep! At least foods with fat in them. Not foods that make you fat. Fat is zero carb whether oil or animal fat. I'd recommend more plant based fats though for healthy fats like mono and poly unsaturated fats. Also omega 3 from fish.

638 2018-03-27 22:23:48 Tear it all down. We busted coal, oil, and railroad monopolies in the 1900s, we need to do some busting again. We need a 21st century Sherman antitrust for the banks (again), telecomms, and big data. This is absurd.

I) artificial amounts of glucose were put on the ball. Your body makes loads of chemicals. For eg. EPO, but taking it is cheating
II) It wasn't just glucose that was being put on the ball. Sucrose, vegetable oil, molasses etc

680 2018-03-27 22:17:40 "i'd like to clarify. 'i'm fried' normally means that i've been dipped in egg and breadcrumbs and dropped into boiling oil. in this case, i just mean i'm beat"

682 2018-03-27 22:17:15 Balancing "wet" shimmer and natural light is interesting. I'm trying to avoid that gratuitous wet porn look. If I based my perception of people's sex life on their art I would think everyone bathes in baby oil before sex and produces high pressured lubrication.

693 2018-03-27 22:15:52 So wages t dropping (like they have 4 years now in the rest of the country). Well, that’s what happens when u have a sellers market employment wise.

707 2018-03-27 22:14:07 No I take the straight up oil under my tongue bc I’m not trying to be edgy, I’m just trying to help my bipolar disorder
708 2018-03-27 22:14:04 I’m loving my wet and coconut oil look I’m not pressed about the heat anymore lol literally
709 2018-03-27 22:13:36 You agree with Ezra on oil pipelines, Israeli apartheid, selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, keeping corporate tax rate low, TPP, increasing military spending you fraud.
710 2018-03-27 22:13:32 Gusto kong kontian yung rice ko pero may chili-garlic oil. . . So????  Deadma nalang sa gusto kong gawin. Mahirap tanggihan ang masarap na pagkain  #AndSoThere
711 2018-03-27 22:13:22 olive oil crest drips your warrior coiled
712 2018-03-27 22:13:18 no amount of money can buy back a sustainable, livable environment, but the oil and gas industry isn't about sustainability, it's about sustaining and expanding profitability for their stakeholders & investors. profits above all else
713 2018-03-27 22:13:08 The US no longer gets anything from the Middle East. We have more than enough of our own oil. We’ve been intervening there lately because of the threat of terrorism. I think most Americans would rather have nothing to do with Syria or the rest of the ME.
714 2018-03-27 22:12:53 Was Rachel part of the team? Was there any link to Whale Oil etc? I can't remember details.
715 2018-03-27 22:12:45 “It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.” Is 10:27 The anointing destroys the yoke!! #Hallelujah
716 2018-03-27 22:12:41  I don't like smoking, but those nugs look amazing  Where can I get them in oil form ? Not just CBD 
717 2018-03-27 22:12:40 You can borrow mine if you want. I just need to do an oil change on it first.
718 2018-03-27 22:12:38 So, Mexico pays taxes to the US? I did not know that!! Are they paying the highest or lowest rate? Do they contribute to FICA  and Medicare, as well? Wow, you really can't make this deal work. You knew all along it wasn't possible...go sell more snake oil!!
719 2018-03-27 22:12:37 I was trying to remember the name of this sitcom that was similar to Roseanne. It was a family and the mom had long blonde hair and I think she worked in an oil refinery or something.
720 2018-03-27 22:12:21 The US would prefer to split Syria in two, and form a submissive new state out of the part with oil fields, one suspects.

722 2018-03-27 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
723 2018-03-27 22:11:53 Add some oil to that machine bud! ^<^

725 2018-03-27 22:11:51 Love to hear your thoughts on the state's addiction to Oil Revenue and the violence that that causes to many families and Mother Earth herself?
726 2018-03-27 22:11:50 Never seen blacks do all that. Just oil. Couple ass slaps. That’s it. 

I’ve only seen white ppl do this. Usually Bang Bros.
727 2018-03-27 22:11:38 Decent crisps -- properly crispy, and not like salted cardboard mouth-razors -- have enough oil as is. You need to be looking at 500+ kcals per 100g of crisps. Under that, yeah, they need something -- a smear of butter, or a dash of vinegar, or who knows!
728 2018-03-27 22:11:22 If this government had any idea how to pay billions in debt without oil they would not have approved any pipeline . #pnpcbc
729 2018-03-27 22:11:20 まぁ、今のところ皆活躍してくれそうやが
730 2018-03-27 22:11:15 I tried that egg and olive oil treatment~ its so weird wwww but fun?
731 2018-03-27 22:10:48 Sounds delish! RT @AndyMfit: @SmashFit l do mine with sweet potato. Top with cinnamon and coconut oil. So good...
732 2018-03-27 22:10:47 it’s made of olive oil and sodium hydroxide and essential oils it’s really pure and STRONG
733 2018-03-27 22:10:40 I started exfoliating my lips in addition to using vitamin e oil and chapstick and my lips feel like a cloud wow
734 2018-03-27 22:10:31 Now I am cranky because I’ve realized I don’t really fully know what Oil of Olay cream even is

738 2018-03-27 22:10:07 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
739 2018-03-27 22:10:02 The women's @LMU_Golf team shoots a final-round 324 to conclude the regular season with a seventh-place finish at the Sunoco Campbell Oil Classic
740 2018-03-27 22:09:50 By the way that was Dick Cheney who pulled all of those strings. We went to war because of Cheney's money ties to Haliburton the Oil company and there desire to drive up the barrel price and also to rape the oil fields and steal billions of gallons of raw crude oil.

742 2018-03-27 22:09:29 I come home from work, Nate does an oil change on my car, has a plate of dinner ready for me and ice cream for dessert.... I love my life 
743 2018-03-27 22:09:26 Fun fact: White truffle oil is created when you milk a demon like a cow.
744 2018-03-27 22:09:15 I was in more pain so I took THC drops (I take both CBD and THC oil for my chronic pain) before going to school eventhough I didn't eat lunch yet and I know that ever goes  well. how that a respectable thing to do
745 2018-03-27 22:09:03 My eyelashes have to gotten to the point where they're bothering me because they're so long.....I shouldn't have used so much castor oil
746 2018-03-27 22:08:54 Maybe they could start with one that takes a gig on an oil platform to battle the wage gap. In a plot twist, she finds out there isn't one.
747 2018-03-27 22:08:28 We’ve all heard the phrase ‘data is the new oil’ but who’s using their data to its fullest effect? @fpg_tweets are for one.
748 2018-03-27 22:08:16 So hungry but at least I got my oil change and I can probably whip something up when I get home because no work (:
749 2018-03-27 22:08:07 はーい^^*
750 2018-03-27 22:07:34 Will try harder.
Supermarket products seem to have palm oil in everything everywhere.
751 2018-03-27 22:07:32 Oil (down) and the dollar (up) are the last shoes to drop in the rapidly shifting market narrative/trend change. I think risk reduction may well force an ugly liquidation event in oil longs and dollar shorts very, very soon leading to an even larger VAR shock.
752 2018-03-27 22:07:28 Nice £30 won today. That'll pay for oil and spark plugs 
753 2018-03-27 22:07:11 @iAmKiaMarie Solid plan! Did you get the oil changed yet?

757 2018-03-27 22:06:29 the only way to steady light & fuel is to remove Goodluck. And i promise you in 6 months Nigeria will be swimming in crude oil & fuel. Buhari will pay you 5,000 monthly for been jobless, our youth will be gain employed with our 3,000,000 jobs a year - Bola Ahmed Tinubu in 2014
758 2018-03-27 22:06:26 Ouch! Please heal up. Try tincture of myrrh mixed with equal parts peanut oil as a salve.
759 2018-03-27 22:06:22 You know it’s hot outside when your coconut oil is in liquid form
760 2018-03-27 22:06:21 So, How many $Millions get to flow to Mueller, unchecked, while he and his merry band of SES lawyers get to spend tax funds covering up all their prior criminal activities while threatening our President with their "insurance policy", & @jeffsessions plays controlled opposition?

765 2018-03-27 22:05:32 Proud of you for taking a stand! Young people have been brainwashed into believing that all things oil and gas are bad for the environment. Required reading should be The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels.
766 2018-03-27 22:05:18 I wonder if they expect people to actually tell the truth.
767 2018-03-27 22:05:14 True,but most at times they r kept on the two attached seats in front
768 2018-03-27 22:05:14 Better than conservatives paying to blow propane torches down hole wasting hundreds of millions of tax dollars handed off to oil companies. Bogus Harper the fool stupid as a stick. Like scheer as well. Stupid as a stick
769 2018-03-27 22:05:08 You prepare a table before me in the

770 2018-03-27 22:05:06 And it's acne, dandruff, overactive oil glands, and so many blackheads in weird places. >>

It *hurts* constantly but I can't do much since I'm always running around. I just have to hide it under clothing for now...

772 2018-03-27 22:04:58 If Garfield was an oil tycoon he'd be Tarfield
773 2018-03-27 22:04:43 SPOT ON. Not every entrepreneur in Angola have a father who simply placed in their hands an oil company, a cement factory, diamonds and large sums of money to buy companies in Portugal
774 2018-03-27 22:04:35 Maybe they should do it with oil lovers in middle East too.
775 2018-03-27 22:04:29 We'll finish too
776 2018-03-27 22:04:26 No political gain was made by invading Iraq. Just Tony Blair's political suicide. The iraq invasion was solely because Saddam Hussein no longer wanted to trade iraqs oil for US dollars
777 2018-03-27 22:04:23 Palm oil is not VEGAN
778 2018-03-27 22:04:12 Lmao other than obesity I find general uselessness to be my biggest pet peeve. Lucky for you I know how to change the oil in a car.
779 2018-03-27 22:04:07 Still and always an egotistical bastardI'm still amazed, shocked that this country elected this snake oil salesman twice....with zero political experience, very questionable associates.  Obviously NO vetting of Soros' pick in order to destroy the USA
780 2018-03-27 22:03:49 I wonder why they think the price of oil will rise soon?
781 2018-03-27 22:03:32 Tea tree oil is high vibe 'tussin. You didn't know?
782 2018-03-27 22:03:17 I have seen more than one article proving that giving dogs CBD oil can do wonders for them. Just like with humans. U just get a little dropper n drop it under his tongue when he’s having a seizure n within seconds it stopped.
783 2018-03-27 22:03:01 Oil Sykes is sooooo fit

789 2018-03-27 22:01:36 That's why l always say: Scientific Possibility is Not Economic Feasibility. Diesel is needed but the Diesel from the Jatropha is currently more expensive than the diesel from crude oil... It's just doesn't make Economic sense... Same thing with Chamisa's bullet train hogwash
790 2018-03-27 22:01:32 You try Lavender essential oil for the skin pain? I think it would help!
791 2018-03-27 22:01:28 Lathered my entire body with coconut oil over night and now I’m so silky smooth
792 2018-03-27 22:01:26 The referee and his guys in the VAR room clearly thought it was an obvious error and thats why they looked at it. No matter what, football will always be subjective and full of different opinions, thats why im not sure of VAR anymore
793 2018-03-27 22:01:23 I will follow back all Trump Supporters and true Conservative Patriots.
I will block all Trolls.
794 2018-03-27 22:01:18 Hard to put everything in context here! Cause without Big Business doing well in US jobs will leave like they have been under the Demos & past Admins! Some times you have to do a dance in the middle it seems. I work in Big Oil & Chemical Factories I have seen this in real action
795 2018-03-27 22:01:09 Is it truffle oil?
796 2018-03-27 22:01:03 Who has interest in CBD oil? Dm me. #CBDoil #CBD #CTFO
797 2018-03-27 22:01:02 When the final curtain finally falls, we might find that shale oil fracking first started as some farmer's dea of getting value out if his land given declining profits from agriculture.

801 2018-03-27 22:00:27 Of course you can! I'm glad you like it 
802 2018-03-27 22:00:25 The oil drill was planned well in advance, multiple companies involved (some with PRC nationals on staff) easy to know the date and assemble an intimidating flotilla to force Hanoi to back down.
803 2018-03-27 22:00:05 I need this lavender oil to work right this second actually.
804 2018-03-27 22:00:04 Cordelia:You're looking a little slagged. Are you just skipping foundation entirely now?
Buffy: Cordelia, I have at least three lives to contend with, none of which really mesh. It's kind of like oil and water and a...third unmeshable thing.
Cordelia: Yeah, and I can see the oil.

806 2018-03-27 21:59:58 @TweedInc hi ? Re products hybrid Blue oil  Does it not come in a safety sealed bottle like Yellow oil does??  Yellow has s safety seal you have to crack to open.  What about the blue??
807 2018-03-27 21:59:50 me and my mom love to make baked fish and roasted vegetables. i know you are a vegetarian so you might be able to substitute fish for something else but we just get our fav veggies in a bowl with olive oil & seasonings and bake them on a cookie sheet for 15-20 mins 375, 10/10!!
808 2018-03-27 21:59:43 Have you tried almond or avocado oil?
809 2018-03-27 21:59:31 I know you *think* you have to spin your tires to let everyone know you’re here, Honda Civic man, but we could tell you were comin from down the block between the exhaust leak and smell of burnt oil
810 2018-03-27 21:59:29 That was the fastest oil change I’ve gotten! 
811 2018-03-27 21:59:22 Love it that someone gets all, we sold our soul to oil money on Facebook, then you post a thing about spurs stadium getting sponsors from Saudi etc they throw a hissy fit refusing to read it. Spurs fans hey lol. Love the delete their responses button.
812 2018-03-27 21:58:48 Don’t clean them with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. It’ll kill all the good bacteria that it needs to heal and it’ll just keep it raw. Instead use like seasalt water or tea tree oil even. That’s what my piercer said to do about my dimples!
813 2018-03-27 21:58:46 Top 3 annoying things us white ladies do that needs to stop: 
1. Blogging about all the ways to use coconut oil. 
2. Calling ourselves feminists, all the while ignoring intersectionality & the systemic racism we’ve all benefited from. 
3. Referring to things as “our journey.”
814 2018-03-27 21:58:40 Joke: Middle East foreign policy is about spreading democracy

Broke: Middle East foreign policy is about getting oil and helping Israel

Woke: Middle East foreign policy is a series of proxy battles where Russia & China support any effort to dethrone petrodollar hegemony
815 2018-03-27 21:58:37 Watching @JulieBishopMP comments about fairness ant not trying to gain an unfair advantage. Wondering why she didn't use this language about the Timor Sea oil?
816 2018-03-27 21:58:33 I keep waiting for the markets in turmoil segment from @CNBC ... #OOTT #oil
817 2018-03-27 21:58:32 Body oil protection. I had similar problems for a while, and it was worse with anti-acne stuff. Too much washing doesn't help since it eliminates the natural oil, and the skin can't "breathe" properly. Feels messy at first, but most of the time you only need just a little care.
818 2018-03-27 21:58:32 Urging @SenStanislawski & all #Oklahoma senators to support & expand upon house bill funding education & teachers. Please, no more cowtowing to Oil & Gas at the expense of public education. #oklaed #okleg
819 2018-03-27 21:58:13 Is it just coincidence that Russia is about to ditch the US dollar for oil sales using gold.... EXACTLY the same thing that happened in Iraq, Lybia and Syria in recent years!
Russia are aligning with China and both have no foreign debt.
The US are TRILLIONS of dollars in debt.
820 2018-03-27 21:57:59 or your coconut oil works great. You know that's my favorite. :)
821 2018-03-27 21:57:58 Houston is oil.  PR is beautiful but poor.
822 2018-03-27 21:57:49 Bipartisan can mean different things: A Looney Leftist and A RINO or A Looney Progressive and a #NeverTrump Republican or A Looney Democrat and A Freedom Caucus Conservative which is Oil and Water and can’t see happening
823 2018-03-27 21:57:47 See you tomorrow. Think you might be on oil distribution duty supervised by moi. #FriendlyTaskMaster
824 2018-03-27 21:57:46 But if you know there’s an oil drill scheduled and you want to make an intimidating show of force to change minds in Hanoi, then you assemble a sizeable flotilla and sail it nearby.
825 2018-03-27 21:57:45 You are@following a snake oil salesman who has never prayed, gone to church or read the Bible. But please go on about forgiveness.
826 2018-03-27 21:57:43 If I were here illegally I'd never say so but let's see what happens.
827 2018-03-27 21:57:20 Water, aloe, cucumber, a facial foam instead of soap, a lovely bit of virgin olive oil
828 2018-03-27 21:57:15 Do you have any idea where Mexico gets its money? Money sent back from the US is the second largest source of revenue for the entire country. It is only surpassed by oil revenue. Plus our purchases. We can shut down the entire economy of Mexico. They will do what we tell them to.
829 2018-03-27 21:56:58 Super easy - cut in half,.place cut side down in cold pan. Drizzle with 3Tbsp olive oil, put a lid on the pan, turn on medium. Cook 5 mins, then remove lid. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir just to loosen from pan, cook another three minutes or so
830 2018-03-27 21:56:49 When you realize #Valvoline has workers underground changing your oil..... MIND BLOWN! Where have I been??
831 2018-03-27 21:56:42 i added coconut oil to my daily skin regimen and i gotta say i smell good and my skin feels a bit smoother already.
832 2018-03-27 21:56:33 I liked her but this #KinderMorgan gamble is clear even Premier, AB NDP has been bullied by big oil... at all cost. Waiting on PM to rescue her won’t cut it
833 2018-03-27 21:56:33 Our #privacy is a second rate citizen   to companies. To them our data is oil. I think it is time we #disrupt this trillion dollar industry. #entrepreneurship #startups
834 2018-03-27 21:56:26 Nope. They fill up the whole thing n r dropped off one after the other.
835 2018-03-27 21:56:21 Court I found this amazing teething oil I’ll send you the link now! You’ve only got to put it on his cheeks!
836 2018-03-27 21:55:44 To prepare, everyone should have a horse, a bike and oil lanterns with plenty of oil in reserve.
837 2018-03-27 21:55:33 would we expect anything different from an Oil & Gas Lobbyist ?
838 2018-03-27 21:55:28 All I think about is oil money
839 2018-03-27 21:55:24 Forever waiting for my fiancé (a mechanic) change my oil
840 2018-03-27 21:54:59 You watched the one on the oil rig?  Another real life one.  Wahlberg film
841 2018-03-27 21:54:45 1 bullet so much as lands on Syrian soil and your naval fleet will hit the bottom of the mediterranean faster than you can say 'muh oil'
842 2018-03-27 21:54:42 Apo Oil Well belongs to Sapetro Oil. It has 500m oil reserve with a daily production capadity of 300,000 barrel.
The company is owned by TY Danjuma.
President Buhari is the only military leader who owns no filling station talk less of oil fields.
He's a contented man.
843 2018-03-27 21:53:54 Thanks. So, labelling has to satisfy criteria that not everyone likes. And what makes sense in one country or region won’t in another. So, a traffic light system which puts eg olive oil on red won’t get through the Brussels lobby (I love olive oil btw).
844 2018-03-27 21:53:26 Well hubby & I r in oil/gas field so 24hrs/7 days a wk.
845 2018-03-27 21:53:23 In my opinion is was not a foul. A Debatable foul is not clear and Obvious that was my point. This will be a real shambles in #Russia2018 #WorldCup #VAR

847 2018-03-27 21:52:43 Been lacking in meds for migraine and have resorted to taking a toke or two of weed. It does help. Would much rather use cannibis oil or vape, but don’t have that legal option here.
848 2018-03-27 21:52:40 This seems to me the answer would involve heavy vs light crude oil & lack of refineries for the former, but if that were the case Albertans would know that, right?
849 2018-03-27 21:52:30 You have to take care of them and do all oil free face and make up products. They are expensive and if you cant get them done often i def wouldnt reccomend them because they look like shit after about the 3-4 week mark. I love them though... especially if you go to someone good
850 2018-03-27 21:52:24 Started putting coconut oil in my coffee and haven’t looked back since
851 2018-03-27 21:52:15 Less division. SNP vote went down. Not anti-Europe emotions. Balanced look at how UK had done in our 40+ yrs in EU. Unemployment rate never lower than the moment when we joined. Record national debt despite 40 yrs of North Sea Oil. Trade deficit. Loss of fishing grounds. CAP.
852 2018-03-27 21:52:07 I just have to say.. I've been using a cbd oil vape additive for the past three days and I can feel a big difference in my level of general anxiety. It's worth trying if you're considering it.
853 2018-03-27 21:52:04 OU students like this have no idea that oil is one of the only reasons OU exists.

A state that holds some of the nation’s best oil and gas assets should not divest in oil and gas. They should utilize it, research it, and become the leader in it. Which is what OU did.

854 2018-03-27 21:51:52 #TheFive Well pretty sure us in oil/gas business will be exempt. All on call 24hrs/7 days a week
855 2018-03-27 21:51:50 The best thing you can do to support steel is build pipelines for the oil and gas sector. Win win situation.
856 2018-03-27 21:51:36 It's not a drug, there is no THC in it CBD oil. Get your facts straight if you want to make knee jerk comments.
857 2018-03-27 21:51:06 The more you know the less you do in the oil field
858 2018-03-27 21:51:05 Might help if we could export our oil.. & grain.
859 2018-03-27 21:51:03 there is an oil IPO then all down hill
860 2018-03-27 21:50:43 Lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper...

862 2018-03-27 21:50:21 That's what the pump oil from a rotavap for noxious compounds that was only trapped with dry ice looks like. One pitfall of working in a large lab is sometimes people forget what their group jobs are, and nobody notices until the equipment breaks.
863 2018-03-27 21:50:08 Oil dey ur head
864 2018-03-27 21:50:08 Tea tree oil is my new fave oil to diffuse
865 2018-03-27 21:49:58 apparently it’s OIL that’ll take the surgical glue off my thumb not water like I was told and now I have to soak my thumb in baby oil and pray the stuff comes off
866 2018-03-27 21:49:53 see that oil and spy divergence bubba the iran news compounds the matter… any sort of big move in any instrument triggering any further margin calls in fact will manifest into other areas...
867 2018-03-27 21:49:48 You already got the castor oil on deck! Ready to stimulate them hair follicles lol I see you
868 2018-03-27 21:49:45 Strips can damage ur capillaries and keep ur pores enlarged! Try a charcoal mask if you rly need to remove oil and dirt
869 2018-03-27 21:49:18 i did. in olive oil.
870 2018-03-27 21:49:07 We could advertise on patchouli oil bottles as a part of our gurilla marketing campaign
871 2018-03-27 21:48:59 Yeah.. so you wont let them drink until they're 21, but you'll let them by an AR-15?  You have to let them vote though; otherwise, how can you send them to die in war at 18 for oil?
872 2018-03-27 21:48:50 @realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. WILL CLEAN THE VA SWAMP. NO VA NEEDS FBI UNDER RICO LAW.
EVERY YEAR ACCORDING TO THE OIL 6 BILLIONS DOLLARS ARE IMPROPERLY PAID. EDWARD MURRAY VA CFO, DID IT. 2017 REPORT, 5.5 BILLION. WHERE IS THE MONEY? CALL FBI. ACCOUNTABILITY?
873 2018-03-27 21:48:33 That's why my vape liquid smells like burning diesel, rancid chip truck oil and ground level ozone.
874 2018-03-27 21:48:26 just put all my life’s hope into tea tree oil
875 2018-03-27 21:47:47 Gone beyond the olbas oil eh? It's awful.

878 2018-03-27 21:47:22 See how people can be waiting on Jesus without the oil!!
Acts 19:2 he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" So they said to him, "We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."
879 2018-03-27 21:47:05 That wasnt your initial point though? Regardless of wether or not it was a clear and obvious mistake, you said it wasn’t a foul because he lost control of the ball?
880 2018-03-27 21:47:00 Looks like how Jane Fonda described the oil sands.
881 2018-03-27 21:46:19 This is awesome, I love it, can I use it?
882 2018-03-27 21:45:54 Cuz it take a lot of paperwork to convince people to buy their snake oil.

884 2018-03-27 21:45:23 I just paid more for my manicure than I did for my oil change today 
885 2018-03-27 21:45:16 It's not a micellar water, but honestly, I swear by coconut oil (ever since I got eczema recently, it's been a godsend for everything!) I use it to remove my makeup, as a cleanser and moisturiser  Really cheap and one tub lasts forever!
886 2018-03-27 21:45:03 He did not even say it is in Ogaden, bit the article says it. They are doong like it is habasha oil
887 2018-03-27 21:44:54 The war then was as disasterous with lives lost as are the wars for money we see today...war is about profit on the stock market and oil.
888 2018-03-27 21:44:35 ~the envelope in and letting the guy go. No chemicals...no explosives inside, but he can smell traces of gun oil and powder on the thick paper. Huh.
Suspicious, but curious nonetheless, he thumbs open the tabs and pulls out the weighted metal star.

And it's Healthy too 
So yeah it's a Win Win situation

892 2018-03-27 21:44:21 Rio Arriba County receives a lot in education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
893 2018-03-27 21:44:20 Um, dude, it's always been a cultural war.

895 2018-03-27 21:44:16 Agreed. But for the naval drill to take place it does not require the oil drill to be obstructed. From a cursory look at the map there seems no real operational requirement.

897 2018-03-27 21:43:59 bruuuh idk if i regret getting a hot oil treatment. my hair looks so plain and flat and straight and i can't wash or wet it for a day (so how am i going to wash my face without wetting my hair)

903 2018-03-27 21:43:04 I’m sorry Rihanna, but I can not pay $60 for a damn body oil 
904 2018-03-27 21:43:03 You have good skin too so you won’t necessarily see like a huge difference but all keeps oil away for me and makes my makeup stay on longer
905 2018-03-27 21:42:55 Said it before and I shall say it again, Data is the new 'Oil'..

908 2018-03-27 21:42:48 i must add, i have no actual opinion on the italy penalty yet as i havent seen it. but a foul is a foul whether the player has control or not
909 2018-03-27 21:42:31 5. Until and unless emissions in AB, and to lesser degree SK, are reduced, CAN is incapable of meeting its 2030 target. Oil and gas emissions growth overwhelm reductions in other provinces.
6. Targetitis - my target is bigger than yours - hampers real progress. 3/3
910 2018-03-27 21:42:28 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
911 2018-03-27 21:42:28 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
912 2018-03-27 21:42:23 Just took some (prescription! California!) cannibis oil. Better than being crazy...
913 2018-03-27 21:42:11 As the old saying goes something like " keep your friends close but Keep Your Enemies Closer", these two idiot oil drinkers are closer. Waiting for the day when .@POTUS
914 2018-03-27 21:42:07 Imagine if Somalia was stable wallahi thats what they dont want, Ethiopia and Kenya are horrible greedy neighbours that treat Somali people like shit but benefit from us and want to see us divided to loot our oil!!!
915 2018-03-27 21:42:06 The irony. 2018 and people still believe in snake oil merchants and other wizards.
916 2018-03-27 21:42:03 Watching caylin drive into Hogan’s to get my oil changed was the most entertaining thing I’ve seen in a while 
917 2018-03-27 21:41:55 Those with innovating minds are continuously working on practical and renewable solutions. We (the USA) went from steam to oil due to innovation. In retrospect, it has been to our collective detriment.
918 2018-03-27 21:41:54 Soggy chicken fingers that taste like oil? No thanks 
919 2018-03-27 21:41:53 you dont have to have control of the ball to be fouled? granted, players sometimes go down easier when they’ve lost control, but if you’re fouled, you’re fouled. by you’re logic, if ive lost control of the ball and you come in knee high on me, thats not a foul?
920 2018-03-27 21:41:44 I love smoking marijuana and it’s honestly so hard not to  

But my lungs. I need those.

And then I could make some oil but I’m like, do I really wanna drop $100 on half an oz to make some canna oil??? Naaaaahhh.

So then it’s a lot easier haha
921 2018-03-27 21:41:41 I love that tingly tea tree oil feeling! 
922 2018-03-27 21:41:41 Ight we need a nigga just to clean up the oil spills
923 2018-03-27 21:41:37 the gold has castor oil I heard

929 2018-03-27 21:40:25 @MBuhari @AsoRock over 200million person are poor in Nigeria. What is the problem? Are we no longer producing oil per day. I feel 4d country. Mr President the solution is easy, RESIGN! because u are old. Let younger person of 35 years of age come onboard. If u're in support say I
930 2018-03-27 21:40:19 How long did it take to notice a difference with the lemon juice? And I haven’t heard of rosehip! But I do already have lots of oils including tea tree oil, do you think that’s a good alternative
931 2018-03-27 21:40:15 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
932 2018-03-27 21:40:13 When I was younger I told myself I’d never go into the oil field bc I hated that lifestyle... but now that I’m older I realize what real sacrifice is & what I have to do to better myself

935 2018-03-27 21:40:05 Cannabis oil? I have lots of friends that make it now. CannaSpirit makes powerful salves and creams.
936 2018-03-27 21:40:05 The US nationalized Amtrak, and the entity loses money every year. I can't wait for the oil industry to be nationalized, and watch it incur huge losses. It'll be just like the PDVSA!
937 2018-03-27 21:39:53 Yeah you can get good olive oil here. Just so damn expensive
938 2018-03-27 21:39:37 Went in for a $50 oil change spent $160  this why I leave the car maintenance to the man
939 2018-03-27 21:39:37 Sorry to be imprecise! Oil drill - multiple companies involved. Many people knew the schedule
940 2018-03-27 21:39:35 Do media feel ethically compromised by relations with Oil+Gas?
941 2018-03-27 21:39:28 @Wilkmaster Soviet fall because of oil and US decline not just because of Boomers 'terrible decisions, but also financialization goosed by petrodollar recycling. Check out ProMarket blog of Stigler discusses some of dwnsides of financialization.

948 2018-03-27 21:38:14 @MGaletti01 your response to unacceptable contrasts in life experiences in SA seemed very similar to mine. The smell of stale urine in the nursery I went to, boiling goats heads in oil barrels and, sadly, far worse housing in the Township. So glad you raised the issues
949 2018-03-27 21:38:07 every time i come to Jiffy Lube i think about the time i came for an oil change and left with a pet mouse. 
950 2018-03-27 21:37:58 MCT oil and Macha tea powder. Ground cinnamon is glitchy too
951 2018-03-27 21:37:53 Detroit and petroleum producers have been bedmates for many decades now, so yeah, it practically is built by big oil.
952 2018-03-27 21:37:44 And the coming of Trump and Kushner, on particular, allowed them to reverse Obama's attempt to cleave the US from Saudi influence. That's part of what his fracking bonanza was about ... it killed the oil market = hammered the oil-dependent Saudis, Russians, Venezuelans...
953 2018-03-27 21:37:44 Actually - you mean drill as in the naval one or the oil drilling?

956 2018-03-27 21:37:35 We know Alex Jones is paid by the Koch Brothers and those stupid enough to buy his fake snake oil.
957 2018-03-27 21:37:17 this hurt me
958 2018-03-27 21:37:06 Someone should file a complaint against Canada with the WTO!  
A reverse GATT violation as Most Favoured Nations (MFN) treatment is given to imports but not Cdn oil!
Canada is treating a domestic product WORSE than a foreign product!
959 2018-03-27 21:36:51 That brings me to another point, why is there a massive disproportionate amount of men doing jobs like mining, oil rigs, logging etc? you don’t see queues of women lining up for those jobs. 
Or do they only want equality when it comes to cushy well paid jobs?

Comments like that is why I let your friends cover your room with Joseph Gordon-Leavetts.

963 2018-03-27 21:36:42 if Kurdish leaders have stolen money or oil then take them to Court but don't punish all Kurds. You are behaving like Saddam

969 2018-03-27 21:35:39 i’ve been informed that there are essential oil vapes, and not to be dramatic but I NEED one
970 2018-03-27 21:35:29 Nor will the LORD overlook the blood of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa being slaughtered daily so British govt and their jihadists can steal OIL. SHAME.
971 2018-03-27 21:35:19 You can start by decriminalizing marijuana. That’s if you truly care about this and the people affected. Otherwise it’s just feel good lip service. I know big pharma, oil and cotton industries fear this but they will just restructure for the good of mankind.
972 2018-03-27 21:35:17 ...this is way more about the bleak long-term prospects for oil as a source of wealth. Al-Naimi saw the handwriting on the wall a decade ago (see leaked cables). The crackdown was about cash and neutering the old guard so he could turn the KSA toward the a Gulf State model.
973 2018-03-27 21:35:16 Someone once said: "We get the Government we deserve". Flippant? No. Truth is it's in our power to stop all the purveyors of establishment mis-information and downright lies. Eg. A European public boycot of Shell Oil stopped the dumping of Brent Spar Platform in the Atlantic.
974 2018-03-27 21:35:01 What did they say the problem was? Did they say why it was eating all that oil? If the car is burning it, you definitely want to have it fixed because oil through the exhaust could end up ruining the catalytic converters and oxygen sensors. Wishing you well.hope it’s a simple fix
975 2018-03-27 21:34:59 I thought I was doing something tryna change my oil .... bye af
976 2018-03-27 21:34:55 CBD oil is the best. I don’t know how I would handle my periods now without it.
977 2018-03-27 21:34:48 Venezuela nationalized their oil industry. How's that working out for them?

The US nationalized Amtrak. How is Amtrak doing?
978 2018-03-27 21:34:31 Well it just so happens that I’m a trust fund kid. My dads an oil and gas magnate, and my mothers an heiress to the Walmart fortune so you’re in luck. Im not sure how much rupees is in US dollars so I’ll have our account look at that. Can’t help with the woman part. Lol.
979 2018-03-27 21:34:28 Also, I would subscribe to your olive oil desk. Still mourning the consequences of moving to the U.S. on my experience of European food- though I must admit that it's good to have access to okay Latino food ingredients again!
980 2018-03-27 21:34:21 You stand in a hospital waiting room, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a butler statue with a tray.
981 2018-03-27 21:34:17 Funny thing is, Oil money will be long gone before there's a chance of that, City are doing something that no City fan has or will ever see again,what we did is Unique, and I say Unique because the word should not be taken lightly. A club born, built and soaked in tradition.Fact!

989 2018-03-27 21:32:54 Be careful. Now that your president has relaxed regulations, that oil rig might explode. It doesn't belong to BP, does it?
990 2018-03-27 21:32:50 Do they have a restraining order on you?

994 2018-03-27 21:31:34 Did the price of oil per barrel go up?
995 2018-03-27 21:31:22 It’s how a former boss Dan Duncan of $epd made it through the oil crash in 1980s.  He said as much.
996 2018-03-27 21:31:17 @MikeHudema makes a good case for building pipelines to reduce tanker traffic.  Let’s get Energy East in the ground and stop importing $Billions of OPEC conflict oil by tanker on the east coast.

1001 2018-03-27 21:30:45 Didn't react well to the pain meds they'd gave her. Another thing- a lot of people don't want to SMOKE and I'd have to turn it into oil for my mom, which is a hell of a process. @GovMurphy please make tinctures and edible oils easily available instead of just bud. Please!
1002 2018-03-27 21:30:44 after driving for months with out a tach, speedo, oil pressure gauge, temp gauge , gas gauge, dome lights and windshield wipers it’s safe to say people have way to many fucking amenities these days
1003 2018-03-27 21:30:42 Thank God!  That fool will destroy this planet if you let him. He doesn’t give a shit about the environment!! Thanks to the Federal court we will still have our public lands for the people and not for the oil and gas companies!

1005 2018-03-27 21:30:27 The Refined Coconut oil product to avoid is RBD coconut oil, which stands for Refined, Bleached and Deodorized. This is one of the worst coconut oil products on the market. #HowToBeWell

1007 2018-03-27 21:30:24 Throw a bit of oil in the pot, heat it up and Then fry the rice until a bit of it is fried up. Add chopped garlic and onion and let them get that brown color a little so the flavor joins the rice. Then add half water, half stock of some kind, spices as you like and veggies.

1011 2018-03-27 21:29:49 Seen quoted today, “...oil producers marry pipelines, but they only date railways.”
1012 2018-03-27 21:29:33 I have always been a bit suspect of folk that aren't VAT. It's not hard to rack up £76k in a year on materials.  At least not for us doing oil and biomass.  A boiler and tank is not far off 3k and 2 a week is fine.
1013 2018-03-27 21:29:31 It's cause you have to pair it with their essential oil stress reducing lotion (with ginger) and the mahogany teakwood car air freshener
1014 2018-03-27 21:29:22 Same applies to all the international oil, utility and tech companies who profit from the Scottish market but only create a London HQ. They will have to create a Scottish HQ and jobs.
1015 2018-03-27 21:29:08 Bro good job I'm happy you did that will be badass hopefully you can make it last too! I just moved to Oregon so I'm gonna be coming to see you bro I wanna chill and smoke with you I know you only smoke at night , I'm Puffin on distillate oil 88% THC. In a Ccell cartidge

1017 2018-03-27 21:28:46 If I were the energy minister of #Iran or #Venezuela or #Russia or #Mexico or numerous others I'd stop selling my oil in US$ and start selling in €'s this would be an effective way to reduce the influence of #TheTrumpRegime

1020 2018-03-27 21:28:08 You are so lucky whenever I go I don't find much the best think I've found at TJ Maxx was a bobbi brown set that had an oil, an eyeliner gel and 2 long wear cream shadow sticks and all for $20.
1021 2018-03-27 21:28:07 does the platonic thing have to be mutual?
1022 2018-03-27 21:28:02 There's no logic in oil naming convention...
Almond oil
Engine oil n
Baby oil.
1023 2018-03-27 21:27:54 ..and we have the oil and the energy.  Those machines would stop working in pretty fast order.
1024 2018-03-27 21:27:53 For the umpteenth time, its the size of our deficit thats the problem. Twice the size that sent Greece bust. Did they do well out of it? I think not. And the expert said Scotland has no debt which is factually incorrect. Remember Salmond (oil economist) said oil would be $113!

1027 2018-03-27 21:27:12 You should use mama mio tummy rub oil, smells so good, I used it when pregnant, have a bottle now and the smell brings back great  memories
1028 2018-03-27 21:27:11 His "we're sorry" apology sounded so much like the BP CEO character in the @SouthPark story about the BP oil spill, surely a similar episode coming up

1035 2018-03-27 21:26:18 I love leaving work at 5pm without fail and I have made my boss so well aware of this fact that when I was still here at 5:19 he told me I was "burning the midnight oil" #its5oclocksomewhere
1036 2018-03-27 21:25:49 I saw someone somehow eject the contents of a Welch 1398 onto their face while cleaning. PPE only protects you from the oil, not the shame!
1037 2018-03-27 21:25:27 Can't have it with tanks that run a Macerator . Not enough oil flow on most tractors.
1038 2018-03-27 21:25:15 Good idea, Ventura County has some nice wineries and offshore oil deposits.

1047 2018-03-27 21:24:20 @KatyTurNBC @RepRyanCostello George W. Bush was not a moral president. It was immoral when he lied about WMDs to convince Congress to vote to invade Iran. For OIL!

1063 2018-03-27 21:22:31 In grad school, somebody once hit the oil drain tap on the pump under our glovebox with their foot, and did not notice. We were finding oil on stuff in that lab for the next year.
1064 2018-03-27 21:22:21 After having my car for 6 months I finally decided to get an oil change 
1065 2018-03-27 21:22:14 1961 here  Bein old has its advantages tho. I know front porches being used would cut down ALOT of problems kids have. VBS attendance should be mandatory for kids. Every kid should change oil & tires before they can drive
1066 2018-03-27 21:22:12 Just guessing, but probably because the oil and gas industry brings more money into Oklahoma than all other industries combined.
1067 2018-03-27 21:22:09 I dream of oil too

1082 2018-03-27 21:20:09 Agree and I suspect that most NLer’s agree as well, moderate, smart, well thought out reductions in spending over the next 2 years could make all the difference and provide us with a little more certainty should oil drop or dollar rise or more tarifs hit forestry/ fishery etc.

1128 2018-03-27 21:14:08 Try oil first, then Fresh Curl and Curl Maker. Or you can try Style Setter and Curl Maker.

1134 2018-03-27 21:13:39 They were super delicious!
So happy I found this tasy oil. Game changer with ALL food!!
1135 2018-03-27 21:13:19 @RepRyanCostello  Ask your daughter if this is the 'environment' she can live in. Is there clean water & air.Will there be Natl Parks and Monuments she can visit w/out viewing oil rigs or fracking equipment killing our land. Ask her that. Ask yourself that. Tx cuts show zero
1136 2018-03-27 21:13:15 I suffer fms and cfs and cbd oil is an amazing treatment for me. Keep up the good work for your beautiful son x
1137 2018-03-27 21:13:15 Unfortunately people pay lip service to wanting something done about climate change but then complain about the cost of gasoline. We are all to blame for GHGs but we do not want to do what is necessary. It applies to me too! I heat my home with oil.
1138 2018-03-27 21:13:05 We are talking about the guns, aren't we? We don't scrutinize car crashes or oil rig blow ups when investigating airplane crashes, do we? Why bring free press and knife attacks here? Sounds like whataboutism to me!
1139 2018-03-27 21:12:55 switch over to CBD oil
1140 2018-03-27 21:12:52 I want to know this too, does the fact he lost control of the ball not matter?
1141 2018-03-27 21:12:45 I suggest that the lady go to countries where they wear masks to breathe their air.  Filth in water. I for one am fed up being portrayed as most filthy consumers on the planet. Just STOP it. Any talk of foreign oil tankers dumping bilge in St. Lawrence?? Build a damn pipeline.
1142 2018-03-27 21:12:44 Very very healthy and tasty dinner Diet carciofi toast(I made at home with garlic+olive oil+red chilli flicks)this you can store in fridge for a weekand boiled broad bean+ a glass of red winer Cheers Now My stomach is full and heart is happy
1143 2018-03-27 21:12:44 There are plenty of caricatures about oil giants and WASP billionaires (try Google), but of course none of them provide the opportunity to smear a major political party immediately before pre-election reporting restrictions start, so you'll never hear about them....
1144 2018-03-27 21:12:42 It's meant to relax the intestine. I used to suffer from IBS and plain hot water always helped. Also peppermint oil (drinkable version) in hot water.

1147 2018-03-27 21:12:25 Ich denke, die machen eher in Digital Snake Oil (womit ich nix verharmlosen möchte).
1148 2018-03-27 21:12:04 Because they can’t move that fast. Oil tanker.
1149 2018-03-27 21:12:04 Yep! Or for under 150 degC if you're not too worried about having perfect heat transfer. We find it often works as well as an oil bath without potentially spilling hot oil everywhere if the reaction is not too sensitive.
1150 2018-03-27 21:11:57 Getting an oil changed and I just had to test drive an SUV
1151 2018-03-27 21:11:56 I dont think you qualify for the first time in my oil diffuser.
1152 2018-03-27 21:11:56 putting coconut oil in your bath water will change ya life, i feel like silk
1153 2018-03-27 21:11:45 I always put oil on my hair directly after washing it and then using a leave in conditioner or hair masque after. Doing that always leaves my hair super soft and moisturized.
1154 2018-03-27 21:11:43 New #Yuan denominated oil futures come after a long effort towards #RMB internationalization. Yet, timing is quite tricky. Washington initiated trade war with Beijing. Either ways, expect more RQFII quotas, licenses and bilateral currency swaps if successful. #OOTT
1155 2018-03-27 21:11:41 Am fine alhamdulillah
1156 2018-03-27 21:11:40 Thought to myself... “I wonder when I will need my oil changed again”.. and then I looked up on my window sticker and I was 5K over since my last oil change. GOOD ONE DARBS.

Running down on the edge of

It is like the dew of Hermon,
Descending upon the

1190 2018-03-27 21:06:21 true but on such a day, i would have expected more given the record short positioning. like oil, ppl need to really throw their economic recovery thinking out of the window, then you can really see some unwinds?!

1209 2018-03-27 21:03:13 Holy Wednesday. Jesus was having supper with his disciples. A woman - Mary anointed Jesus with a costly herb called spikenard. The disciples asked why the oil was not sold to help the poor. Judas then went to the Sanhedrin and offered to deliver Jesus to them for money.
1210 2018-03-27 21:03:11 Same. Leftover white rice fried in olive oil with green onions, bacon bits, salt, pepper, garlic powder, soya sauce and a scrambled egg. The kids prefer it to take out.
1211 2018-03-27 21:03:09 Oh, you mean a strigil! Good old Roman bathing technique. Cool! Oil pulling reduces bacteria deep in the teeth pockets, protects against cavities & decay, whitens your teeth & even boosts your immune system!

1222 2018-03-27 21:02:03 I thought the Excel pipe line would bring gas prices down, since we don’t have to import as much oil. Another bull crap lie !!

1225 2018-03-27 21:01:53 Looks like the Chinese have caught the West napping. The EU (including UK) has been obsessed with itself. The US, obsessed with Oil and the Middle East  and now themselves. So during this collective navel gazing, the Chinese have invested in resource rich Africa and elsewhere.

1227 2018-03-27 21:01:17 Port statistics are useful to people seeking truth. They also reveal that most export shipments of Alberta oil products from Westridge Terminal, including dilbit, are going to USA not to Asia, which proponents of Kinder Morgan expansion claim is its justification. #bcpoli

Russia will control production for a higher price.

1244 2018-03-27 21:00:20 Fair enough! But mayo is just egg/oil/seasoing when you make it. And you want the binding properties. Not sure how yogurt would stack up. You'd have to test it.

But I'm seriously just talking a table spoon or so for a while zucchini. Just enough to make it hold during the bake.

1248 2018-03-27 21:00:02 Putting it on Sunnybrook is no different then having the Target pharmacy down there that is full of opioids. Not like people are going to be going in and buying stuff without a script. It is oil with no THC, so not like potheads will he hanging out on the streets

1257 2018-03-27 20:57:53 Political ideologies aside, the economics don’t favour Canadian Oil. Excluding taxes, the WSJ reports production costs of $24.17/barrel (USD as of March 2016).That puts  at the 4th most expensive oil producer on the planet. Our energy independence includes going green.
1258 2018-03-27 20:57:39 I gotta thing for this new Coconut Oil it smells so good on my skin and it’s soothing  I be ready to go to sleep right out the shower Ima try it on my baby later see if it put her to sleep

1264 2018-03-27 20:56:43 apparently bio oil works well but you've probably already tried, hope you find something sis 
1265 2018-03-27 20:56:39 If the whole Thorium-reactor thing would launch worldwide, the need for oil would plummet. What a good idea!!

1290 2018-03-27 20:52:35 $XOM has been on my radar recently as well. I think there may be trouble on their books. Too much debt, energy reserves marked higher than they are likely worth, and a denial of the likely future impact of renewables and electric vehicles on their oil & gas business.
1291 2018-03-27 20:52:17 Oil prices are rising don't get excited Naira will flop again

1294 2018-03-27 20:52:06 Its not about convincing you that an oil spill is gd, it's more about convincing you that a spill won't occur from these medium size aframax vessels, there's so much mitigation in place the chances are so slim, but that slim chance is void to you, a void you'll never overcome
1295 2018-03-27 20:51:48 I wish I liked him more.

If you're in Devon, you can find this gem at @thecheeselarder South Molton, or South West Cheese, Barnstaple. Perfect with cheese!
1311 2018-03-27 20:48:21 And you should save the seeds. Toss them in oil, stir in some paprika, roast. Lovely as a snack or a salad topping.

1316 2018-03-27 20:47:42 You’re not convincing me of the benefit of an oil spill yet.
1317 2018-03-27 20:47:42 I do get enough oil to want to every day.
1318 2018-03-27 20:47:38 I think they're completely indifferent to that. They think it'll only be soldiers or LEOs that do the confiscating, so of any of them die it's eggs and omelets.  As far as gun owners dying, they'd consider that a feature.

1322 2018-03-27 20:46:50 I'm not sure what this guy is all about. He said Scotland has no debt. Er, yes, we do. We'd have our share of the national debt. And our yearly £13 Billion deficit. He also fails to appreciate that you can have unlimited amounts of oil but it means nothing if its not profitable.
1323 2018-03-27 20:46:48 Roast with avocado oil and Kerry gold butter, sea salt - yum
1324 2018-03-27 20:46:21 Good move IMO. It’ll take time to turn the oil tanker that F1 has become but Ross et al will get it heading in the correct direction.
1325 2018-03-27 20:46:19 I think it would do wonders for my legs in my pum pum shorts but I’m going to stick with my coconut oil

1331 2018-03-27 20:45:46 Combine 11 lbs eggrolls with 8 oz jalapeño. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Roast. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
1332 2018-03-27 20:45:40 I am probably crazy and wrong but the longer SCOTUS takes with Oil States seems the likelihood that they kill the PTAB becomes stronger.  We will see.
1333 2018-03-27 20:45:40 Nope. Doesn't cut demand and there is no real substitute for oil in all of its functions or to the degree to which it is used. Plus oil isn't the only thing depleting: rare earth elements are an example.
1334 2018-03-27 20:45:39 It’s actually been amazing for my skin hey. I cleanse with it sometimes even. It’s the only oil which my naturally oily skin can take.

It moisturizes deep AF. And leaves me smooth and glowy

1354 2018-03-27 20:42:12 It is crucial for the Government & Congress to come up with a solution to save the marine wildlife animals. Trump is too busy working on fossil fuel oil drilling, he can care less about the environment and the living sea creatures and mammals that need to survive life, not death.

1362 2018-03-27 20:40:55 Do I tell this person light roast = more oil = more likely to be bitter? Because they are operating on the assumption their medium dark is a bitter coffee but the light is not.
1363 2018-03-27 20:40:50 It has more to do with being able to control production and the global oil price.
1364 2018-03-27 20:40:40 If @EPAScottPruitt has anything to do with the judging, I imagine the winner will be chosen based on which project most benefits the oil, gas, coal or chemical industry.
1365 2018-03-27 20:40:26 I have definitely had bad hot dogs. They shouldn't feel like rubber and taste of old garbage oil.

1403 2018-03-27 20:36:59 I use a peeler & carefully peel off the hard flesh,  steam them for 2-3 minutes and fry them in olive oil. My Chef friend showed me.
1404 2018-03-27 20:36:54 coconut oil is only good for being a natural makeup remover and moisturizer for certain hair types also the only rosewater cleanser products u can trust is this one underground brand called cocokind
1405 2018-03-27 20:36:53 It is a brilliant move by Trump if he does it.  I like the @ericbolling idea of Mexican oil money too.
1406 2018-03-27 20:36:42 Oil can be fully replaced by sustainable energy and we will still do everything only cleaner. Yes airplanes and truck and yes to hemp derived plastics.

1409 2018-03-27 20:36:31 They believed the snake oil he was selling would be good for them. They were conned. They didn’t believe us. They liked the flash, the hype, the showmanship. They basically got sucked on by the carnival barker. And we get caught in the fallout.

1415 2018-03-27 20:35:43 Here you can see what I mean about lack of economics and logic 101. An uneducated fool makes so called politicians believe that oil can be extracted from a rock. Moreover you mix that with tradition. Afrika is really cursed.
1416 2018-03-27 20:35:32 @LFPress @GasBuddyDan man your out of touch there's 60 cents a litre in pure corporate and government greed. #Canada People deserve the truth. Converted to CAD a US gallon of gas is 76.4 cents a litre even with a few cents more in tax. Report the truth not what big oil tells you.

1423 2018-03-27 20:34:56 A Reuters poll found that US crude oil stocks likely increased by 420,000 bbls, following a surprise drawdown last week. The build, if confirmed would mark the fourth weekly gain in the last five weeks.

1464 2018-03-27 20:30:52 U can follow the same directions for trim or flowers, but you'd have to use way more than an eighth, and let simmer for about 3hrs , then jist strain all the oil from the plant matter at the end. This also makes the edibles taste way more like weed

1492 2018-03-27 20:28:40 Get some concentrate (an 8th should be more than enough ) simmer it and stir it into 1-2 cups of coconut oil for about an hour or two on low (Don't let boil or bubble up) , then use the oil in what ever recipe you want .

1503 2018-03-27 20:27:39 That’s precisely my point.. all the ingredients in the oil are present before and after it’s processed. U may change the state of the properties, but it’s still the same. School will have u believe our breath is a pollutant. It’s carbon

1511 2018-03-27 20:27:02 OLIVE the FACTS #3: According to @greekdiet, olive oil's antioxidents are sensitive to oxygen -- so when you buy olive oil, go for smaller bottles more often, rather than buying in bulk! #nowyouknow #nobulk #infusedoilsandvinegars #chefmichelle #ordinarytoextraordinary
1512 2018-03-27 20:27:02 My understanding is that low-carbon feedstocks are fundamentally limited. Never will be enough. Second, pricing is a killer. Bloomberg says global investment in biofuels "down 98 percent from a decade ago". IRENA says current plant oil biojet impossible to scale up as needed.
1513 2018-03-27 20:26:57 Lowest unemployment, best economy the country ever been, NK has stopped threatening US and other countries with nucklear strike, Us getting more fare trades, in 2020 we will surpass Russia as the world #1 oil producer.

1521 2018-03-27 20:25:24 Ok no TransFats poison, BUT loaded with sugars, hardly any REAL oats, I’d call that ‘sprinkle of oat dust’! But PALM oil= environmentally harmful to wildlife. #palmoil @PalmOilProject

1524 2018-03-27 20:25:06 Hmmm, trying to portray a fair critique, but not quite. This is just a distraction from the fact that the USA leading the West wants control of Syria's oil and Russian resources for cheap. If not by hedge funds then by military might.

1551 2018-03-27 20:21:48 All the other ships aren’t oil tankers and so you’d be adding this extra risk to an already busy and densely populated Metro Vancouver harbour. That’s an incredible increase in the amount of oil we’re proposing to move in and out just to ship to Asia. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli

1576 2018-03-27 20:18:41 Illegal mining of people's personal data, illegal cross campaign collaboration and using  dodgy companies like #CambridgeAnalytica to do it. The chickens are coming home to roost. The snake oil salesman are being found out
1577 2018-03-27 20:18:35 He gets olive oil and butter on everything and doesn't do a thorough enough job of cleaning up after himself so when you go to use the stove or touch the kitchen table or countertop you get a greasy mess on yourself and your day gets 2000 times worse.  #StrangeReasonsToDivorce

1686 2018-03-27 20:03:27 Afelius oil free, es el que yo uso. No es un bloqueador cosmético como “neutrogena, eucerin, banana boat...” es dermatológico y esa es la gran diferencia entre los productos buenos y los malos.

1689 2018-03-27 20:03:06 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
1690 2018-03-27 20:03:01 I watched the @callmesevana Justice video...decent treatment. Strong images...nice puking of oil by the guy. Having become intimate with the song over the past few weeks...I would have liked to see a protest/ advocate treatment done to it. Good job regardless
1691 2018-03-27 20:02:56 Legion smiles and swallows back his tears, standing and moving to bring over a small table he used to use for doing the cleaning, some cleaning product he had make for the cleaning of Ciphers arm and some new oil manufactured for this very happening.

1695 2018-03-27 20:02:41 Are we in need to create a new word for the type of war we live under? Where many "hidden" interests have their hands in resources like Coltan, #Gold #Steel #Oil #UraniumOne #diamonds #drug trafficking routes #Armageddon seems appropriate but we also have Islamic interets

1699 2018-03-27 20:01:52 there’s nothing that coconut oil can’t fix
1700 2018-03-27 20:01:48 Israel will defend itself, with or without  permission,but there IS a simple solution. There are 58 Muslim nations, many HUGE with oil, why can't Israel offer large sums of $$ to those who hate Israel & VOLUNTARILY wish to accept it in exchange for leaving, and do so in peace?
1701 2018-03-27 20:01:40 I wanted to get a very bronze tan for carnival but i think I’ll just oil my body in the glitter and tan while i jump lmao
1702 2018-03-27 20:01:38 My dad definitely did not just tell me how to check the oil in my car with a tampon
1703 2018-03-27 20:01:36 Taiwan’s annual exports amount to about USD$275 billion, putting it in 17th place globally (and two spots ahead of oil giant Saudi Arabia).
1704 2018-03-27 20:01:25 RT HeartofTARDIS: A patient of mine, who also has #fibromyalgia, just gave me a sample of cannabidiol hemp oil salve to try for my pain. She says it has helped her a great deal. We talked about how much we get tired of having to manage our pain on a daily basis.
1705 2018-03-27 20:01:23 With all the fracking, the biggest oil reserves in the world, biggest oil producing country in the world...

1709 2018-03-27 20:01:04 I'll drink to that!
1710 2018-03-27 20:00:48 Our NC tuna spring rolls are a perfect first course for your dinner tonight. They're filled with tuna, local purple cabbage slaw and sesame seeds and served with a chili oil and spicy mustard aioli on the side.
1711 2018-03-27 20:00:33 A drop of baby oil in your foundation helps to hydrate your skin and gives a soft dewy look.
1712 2018-03-27 20:00:23 He is not my hero,and u cannot compare the financial standings of states during the oil boom and the financial state now,wike is receiving half of what amaechi received,from d federal govt,and govt is a continum so completing projects is a priority
1713 2018-03-27 20:00:12 Standard Oil building comes to mind.
1714 2018-03-27 20:00:08 Iran ranks first in the world gas reserves, fourth in oil, and the first in the world in terms of oil and gas resources altogether. Because of Iran's resources, the enemy wants domination and custody over our country.

1716 2018-03-27 19:59:59 That jmhy is a long term holder and knows what he's talking about "its just a matter of hitting a sweet spot proper drilling and stimulation"
1717 2018-03-27 19:59:47 Finally got an oil change 
1718 2018-03-27 19:59:46 U mean Virgin oil?
1719 2018-03-27 19:59:43 Yesterday @ Ulta: 
Cashier: okay this face wash is gonna be $17 (it’s the size of a traveling hand cream)
Kyle: nah nah you don’t need that 
Cashier: this Mario badesku oil drops is $22 (slightly bigger than eye drops container)
Kyle: nope you don’t need that either take it out
1720 2018-03-27 19:59:33 Listen, sometimes women are cranky because we can't for the life of us remember which Oil of Olay cream we use.
1721 2018-03-27 19:59:21 Can’t go wrong with any of those!!! My only suggestion is to caramelize someone minced onions and a bit of garlic in some olive oil on a pan, then add the Alfredo, about a cup of Parmesan, salt n pepper, and then let it cook until its nice n thicc
1722 2018-03-27 19:59:07 Wow no wonder Shell wants to do business there as they don’t seem to care about the environment, with all that oil being let into the river
1723 2018-03-27 19:58:58 I’m sure they’re working on a future device that’ll slice off that problem. SNIPPER LIPS for the little NIPPER. Give them time. Perhaps it’ll be similar to a mouth guard, only this one will release hot  oil once activated and will catapult BlackDressMan into a garden of agony.
1724 2018-03-27 19:58:52 A patient of mine, who also has #fibromyalgia, just gave me a sample of cannabidiol hemp oil salve to try for my pain. She says it has helped her a great deal. We talked about how much we get tired of having to manage our pain on a daily basis.
1725 2018-03-27 19:58:40 Lol. I bought castor oil, glycerine, hair mayonnaise and styling milk. (All small small containers at Ebeano)
1726 2018-03-27 19:58:15 Honestly, shit might not even bleed on sheets.. might be the best oil known to humanity.
1727 2018-03-27 19:58:12 US equities meltdown... not a surprise... but impressive how emerging market currencies hold it reasonably well; the weak USD narrative more important than risk off in EM currencies. #usdzar #usdtry #usdmxn #forex #fx #forex #EmergingMarkets

1729 2018-03-27 19:58:09 He's going to defend his oil investments in the middle east with military money while many of  our enlisted are on food stamps. Our veterans hospitals are in shambles.
1730 2018-03-27 19:58:05 Just got a new oil cartridge on friday and it cracked and drained cause I rolled over on it in my sleep...good
1731 2018-03-27 19:58:02 Pkk only in mountain not city. Except for manbij, tel abyad. We will take easily. Not will like groznıy. I can compare all world with Turkey. Because this land is our land. We dont want oil or gold. We not like USA or Russia. Turkey always peaceful in normaly.
1732 2018-03-27 19:58:02 If I could marry food, I would of course wed pie and mash (with liquor) - but I have to say, I think I would have a crazy fling with olive oil. 
1733 2018-03-27 19:57:48 Curses! That was a bottle of olive oil!
1734 2018-03-27 19:57:31 Landmark will custom build one for you out of rhino wood. Not cheap but looks great and if treated as directed with oil it will last a long time.
1735 2018-03-27 19:57:23 anyone getting on 30 bypass at p'burg, there's a red pickup right after the bridge spewing out smoke, probably diesel runaway. couldn't stop bc late for work but basically it's running on oil and tears the engine up, tell them to choke off the turbo with a 2x4 or something
1736 2018-03-27 19:57:20 You take the car in for a oil change , then wanna turn around & say you have a oil leak , & then sum.
1737 2018-03-27 19:57:15 @cbcallinaday Too much food is packaged in plastic - a byproduct of the oil industry. Onus should be on the producers here not the consumer.
1738 2018-03-27 19:56:57 Bill Gates only sells Computers, but has invested $1.6billion on healthcare in Nigeria. Your billionaires own oil blocs but only buy properties overseas!
1739 2018-03-27 19:56:52 I thought that as well, but the high fever doesn't fit. Or, maybe they are just lying.  I did notice that OPEC and RU are going to rule oil for the next 10-20 years. (Trump is such an amateur that he will have 2nd mortgaged us all by the time he gets done.)
1740 2018-03-27 19:56:51 Hi David.  My pet snake is distinctly ungreasy at the moment.  Any chance could sell me something to oil him with?
1741 2018-03-27 19:56:49 Right after I take care of another oil leak, another flaky O2 sensor, a first-gear synchro issue ... the perennial joys of internal combustion engine ownership.

That next-gen @Tesla Roadster can't come soon enough! =)
1742 2018-03-27 19:56:48 That was my intention after seeing the warning haha

I put the wrong captcha in like ten times and they still let me keep trying. 

I’ll find another way to annoy them later, getting an oil change atm
1743 2018-03-27 19:56:24 Ouch! I'm hoping you are alright! Those oil burns burns are no joke. When pregnant with my daughter I had oil splash on my bump through my shirt. Still have the scar from it.
1744 2018-03-27 19:56:23 ThrowBack! To the OIL!!
1745 2018-03-27 19:55:40 If you had only one match and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp, some kindling wood, and a newspaper, which would you light first? #LandonQnA
1746 2018-03-27 19:55:39 I saw that the ducks were on the list and didnt even think it was worth voting. Lol. Oilers fans- crazy for home team to the last
1747 2018-03-27 19:55:33 jamie Vardy and tight holes.
1748 2018-03-27 19:55:32 Pay attention, parents!
Never, ever trust the Democrats=>They are brainwashing and exploiting your children in order to advance their Liberal agenda.
1749 2018-03-27 19:55:25 Girl same! I know how to reset my change oil one and my low tire one. And they’re always like, “uhh...are you sure you’re doing that right?” Lol.
1750 2018-03-27 19:55:20 Oil change & rotating tires .
1751 2018-03-27 19:55:11 tfw u r dealing with money/car problems during mercury rx and dab good fortune oil on ur hands before u leave and holy heck was that a good idea. Listen up, friends, to a tale of caution and hope. (1/9)
1752 2018-03-27 19:55:03 @ProudResister @CBSPolitics always the salesman selling snake oil, & he sold his lies to those most weak minded
1753 2018-03-27 19:54:47 The ( then) 50% mortality rate for underwater welding was the key reason I did not go into commercial diving in the late 70’s.  Oil platform@work is highly skilled and very dangerous. New skills and equipment is very much better now.
1754 2018-03-27 19:54:45 My favourite essential oil thanks for the chance
1755 2018-03-27 19:54:35 lol we need a conspiracy not of Wall Street, but of Big Oil
1756 2018-03-27 19:54:15 I'm just going to have quick peep on lse. See what the Swampies are banging on about now :)
1757 2018-03-27 19:54:09 RENU on central ave!! Been going there and I’m happy as can be !! Also use castor oil to help them get thick 
1758 2018-03-27 19:54:00 What would you keep flour, salt and oil water for?
1759 2018-03-27 19:53:55 Tried to be generous to him in light of service.
Everytime he pokes his head above ground for a moment he makes it harder to do. 
1760 2018-03-27 19:53:53 I think I messed up, I have a ten foot oil, and a flask of poles.
1761 2018-03-27 19:53:20 hot tip: tea tree oil
1762 2018-03-27 19:53:11 WHY DO WE STILL USE PALM OIL AND WHY DOES CHRIS BROWN STILL HAVE A CAREER???
1763 2018-03-27 19:53:04 I guess I would be copying you but I would do it in oil pastel or watercolour
1764 2018-03-27 19:53:01 yes that's one up on the triple ...go Scotland....hows that England doing and @UKOGlistedonAIM
1765 2018-03-27 19:52:58 And baby oil
1766 2018-03-27 19:52:53 I'll grant you Getty handed over huge logging licenses/FMAs for a song. But incentives he tried for oil/gas were small compared to Klein admin. also Klein: CEO's brought into each dept. budgeting process, dereg/privatization to extremes, flat tax, much lower corp taxes
1767 2018-03-27 19:52:53 I see now that it's a body oil after a lil research.. cool 
1768 2018-03-27 19:52:33 Rates have mostly stabilized. Still have multiple rates running (interbank, parallel market, IEFX etc) but they're much closer in range than before. Oil helped. CBN still influencing rates via interventions for businesses
1769 2018-03-27 19:51:57 has anyone else used tea tree oil and had an allergic reaction to it?
1770 2018-03-27 19:51:52 Lmfaoo yeah the “shark oil” was not a good choice
1771 2018-03-27 19:51:41 i think i’ll do the coconut oil next
1772 2018-03-27 19:51:35 Use castor oil on ur lashes
1773 2018-03-27 19:51:26 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1774 2018-03-27 19:51:24 Leftists are really sick ppl. Why the hell does everything have to be about promoting their civilization destroying agenda?
1775 2018-03-27 19:51:23 If he had his way Big Oil would be fracking in Yellowstone National Park.
1776 2018-03-27 19:51:22 Get you a man that changes your oil and pays for it too #ilovehimsomuch
1777 2018-03-27 19:51:21 It's a bit late now to oppose KM. Get the project done for the good of the Canadian economy. It's best way to get oil to markets.
1778 2018-03-27 19:51:18 hypocrital bitches in my country, they'd rather watching a stupid football game than being in the streets, protesting for the things that are wrong...like that oil spillage in the rivers from our country. Ugh
1779 2018-03-27 19:51:17 So... I'm cooking beans
I've added salt, palm oil, onions.
What else do I need to add??
1780 2018-03-27 19:51:15 I still sweating . Did they stop draining your oil from the cloud, can't wait to live forever.
1781 2018-03-27 19:51:01 Time to stop "the oil addiction." There should be an Oil Addicts Anonymous just like AA.
1782 2018-03-27 19:51:00 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil. 
1783 2018-03-27 19:50:45 Oil is only a bonus!
1784 2018-03-27 19:50:37 So the oil in my house is finally fixed I am such a happy woman 
1785 2018-03-27 19:50:34 Crude oil at $5
Dow at 4000
Dxy at 120.

After the unwind
1786 2018-03-27 19:50:24 And yet we allow it to continue because oil companies must be allowed to make as much profit and pay as little as possible.
1787 2018-03-27 19:50:24 Power and control.
1788 2018-03-27 19:50:19 I'll add that China has begun (this week) oil futures priced in yuan. This will be competition to the #petrodollar.  But hey, Walmart will keep selling us products Made in China.
1789 2018-03-27 19:50:14 ForgetGas and oil.investelectricbattery
1790 2018-03-27 19:50:09 Nope because I wasn’t comparing the two types of oils on the unhealthy food versus the healthy food. I understand that, I know why one is healthy and one is not. I’m just asking how people can drop pizza outta their life and eat spinach with oil for every meal cause that’s wild
1791 2018-03-27 19:50:03 Ohhh got the giggles again .
1792 2018-03-27 19:49:59 Does anyone use / used the Tea Tree Oil products from The Body Shop? Are they any good?
1793 2018-03-27 19:49:58 Have been scaling back on long positions anyway recently - mainly oil cos currently
1794 2018-03-27 19:49:56 I only hair products I brought with me was some argan oil 
1795 2018-03-27 19:49:48 It's not that is the US intervining and preventing final acts of terroism. We could ignore it and the US would be fine besides the face we get reasource from the middle East. That's why we are there oil
1796 2018-03-27 19:49:45 We will indeed......
1797 2018-03-27 19:49:42 your right & that has always been the way nations look to take from others.  But as much as that happens you see the results of evil as US invaded Iraq to steal oil & look at the chaos/crisis the US is in today due to the evil done.
1798 2018-03-27 19:49:38 Its us Indian's manufacturing skill & technical capacity that made Rolls Royce start manufacturing engines in India, The Indian Mercedes & BMW cars have India made engines too. So when Gulf countries want to shift its economy from Oil to Manufacturing -INDIA could be the answer.
1799 2018-03-27 19:49:25 Hi it's me, the crudle oil you expected to find when you saw my oily ass face.
1800 2018-03-27 19:49:20 Funded by entertainment bussiness?
1801 2018-03-27 19:49:12 You dont get my point. There's no prolem with them being here but they're here because of a better life while their country has potential to create a better environment for them but they aren't just doing that thus them having land/oil becomes questionable.
1802 2018-03-27 19:48:42 Do you think oil billionaires are pushing for solar power & green energy? No. Greed often pushed morals out the window & that’s what I think is going on with any person making money off our current lax gun laws
1803 2018-03-27 19:48:37 ..and self aware that there will be issues in a free society and that our pols will take advantage of and blame on other side. Your views sound great but cannot be applied. We will be living in a Tel Aviv type security state inside of a decade IMO. Lastly, NRA~big pharm~big oil
1804 2018-03-27 19:48:34 Our people say it is one's yams that cause one's hand to be stained with palm oil
1805 2018-03-27 19:48:31 Thinks have changed since I did my PGCHE. It was oil lamps and two cups with a bit of string between back then.
1806 2018-03-27 19:48:27 Lol yes coconut oil
1807 2018-03-27 19:48:19 Petro/Yuan exchange opened on 3-26-18 in Shanghai, successfully. China, largest importer & consumer of oil. Russia largest producer &  largest exporter to China. Will be done in Ruble/petroyuan. Danger for dollar, US hegemony. No woder, UK/US/ EU/NATO go berserk with Russophobia.

1811 2018-03-27 19:47:30 licking oil on Twitter too? Smh
1812 2018-03-27 19:47:23 Around 7Apr for oil shows and rumours etc

Worth remembering that RD1 has the secondary target as well where we could get oil shows as well
1813 2018-03-27 19:47:00 need to get my oil changed soon. @jiffylube (chantilly, VA) i’m coming for ya.
1814 2018-03-27 19:46:59 Lol That Julsey don't trust me. Hope we all meet up for Champers one day When you're Uncle Steve gets Horsy Hill gushing again :)
1815 2018-03-27 19:46:57 I agree but Nigeria still has so many things to deal with even if they have such as oil and land, the natural resources aren't utilized in favour of citizens... SA has it's crisis but I think we haven't reach a point of being strunded! Many leave Nigeri because they're strunded.
1816 2018-03-27 19:46:53 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
1817 2018-03-27 19:46:43 Understand stupidity breeds stupidity on left.
Quickly turning into not only attack on #2nd but on 1st as well. 
Interwoven nature of rights

1819 2018-03-27 19:46:28 and we have high unemployment, high inflation price rise, no freedom and justice, no health care without money. oil money goes to proxy war in Syria also Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon is called STEALING OLD MAN from Iranian people
1820 2018-03-27 19:46:24 just when I think I've rocked this whole adulting thing & really have a handle on life, I realize my car is like 800 miles past a "due oil change"
1821 2018-03-27 19:46:23 Are they going to gang upon U.S with its newly discovered oil reserves & wealth?
1822 2018-03-27 19:46:21 Trump's "madness" is actually genius. 3 birds w/1 stone: 1. Threaten trade war, negotiate better trade. 2. Incr oil & gas prod & export to Europe 3. Incr steel & alum & export against Chinese. This is how to wage war w/China & Russia w/out a shot! Genius!

1850 2018-03-27 19:42:00 I can't speak for Bay, but in HOU it's because relocation teams for oil gas will offer 100% cash "Sight unseen". This means fast close, no banks disputing valuation, and seller doesn't have to fix anything wrong with house.

1868 2018-03-27 19:39:39 Nice bit of information, thank you.  But it seems like even if water couldn’t get in, neither could the oxygen the fire need to burn oil or whatever fuel.

1873 2018-03-27 19:38:52 I think any spill cleanup must be paid for by the company responsible for the spill, and there should be hefty fines as well, if poor practices caused the spill. The company profiting from the oil must bear the costs of doing business properly.
1874 2018-03-27 19:38:48 nothing will be as iconic as ramona saying she and bethenny are like “oil and vinegar” and that’s just the tea

1892 2018-03-27 19:36:54 Just wen u think he can't get worse, he does. He  actually wanted to appropriate land use n mineral rights on Public land n drill for oil.

1901 2018-03-27 19:36:20 oil & gas giants want to make this about money while the environment they destroy never recovers. these irresponsible corporations with their bone-headed extraction and transportation projects should be barred from doing business in Canada in the first place yet here they are
1902 2018-03-27 19:36:17 Us womenfolk shouldn’t own guns anyways b/c they will just get wrested away from us by the criminal.

1907 2018-03-27 19:35:08 Jaws Unleashed already established that Jaws can understand and use explosives, sabotage industrial machinery, use RFID card readers, and find out where oil executives live so as to set them on fire. The DBS sharks are idiots compared to that.

1915 2018-03-27 19:34:00 We just will let this infrastructure go undeveloped. That won't harm the tax payer. Oil royalties will only get better forever too.

1920 2018-03-27 19:33:13 Rattie, Bear, Aberg etc all have small samples and the games are meaningless so we must ignore any success they have
1921 2018-03-27 19:33:06 So building the canvas or buying the canvas will be 50-150 depending on price of wood, canvas, and gesso.

Oil paint, is like 75 for a tube of white, and eco house paint thinner ain't cheap, so I'm gonna ball park 400-500 for materials, and then 600 for time. $1100 USD.

1958 2018-03-27 19:29:18 It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, no make that Quaker State.
1959 2018-03-27 19:29:14 This is why oil companies don't care about climate change. They need the Earth to warm up so they can drill near the North Passage.
1960 2018-03-27 19:29:14 Why the heck would we need krill oil for?? Just leave krills to the  #GoVegan 
1961 2018-03-27 19:29:11 Need one more goal from those delicious chocolate makers or those rich ass oil tycoons  #Belgium #SaudiArabia
1962 2018-03-27 19:29:08 Only if they sold the Oil Reserves back too.
1963 2018-03-27 19:29:05 I don’t even try to buy makeup that controls my oily skin anymore  I just embrace it. The “glow” is in right now and it also helps prevent wrinkles in the long run so I’ve just accepted being an oil slick.
1964 2018-03-27 19:29:01 I was in a meeting about a massive condo/apartment building going in near Lucas Oil Stadium on S. Meridian. Discussing how to use public spaces and what not. "You need a space for musicians to play!" - Me 22 times.
1965 2018-03-27 19:28:54 Well dispensaries and smoke shops always throwing bigger sales on 7-10 it’s Oil upside down, glass be cheaper, all concentrates cheaper etc
1966 2018-03-27 19:28:49 . You’re wrong though...essential oils WILL work. Just like how coconut oil reverses cavities. At least that’s what my patient tells me. She comes in A LOT 
1967 2018-03-27 19:28:48 Stop eating crappy foods. CBD oil and organic juicing.

1971 2018-03-27 19:28:29 Oil sounds nice, actually. Tea too but that is a given. *She grins broadly.* I had no idea they can do that. I always thought it was ... just pretty to look at.

1974 2018-03-27 19:28:23 If you get it a little wet and then scrub with salt and a paper towel until all the gunk comes off, rinse, then lightly oil and put the pan back on the burner until the water has evaporated and the oil has baked in, you’re good to go!

1992 2018-03-27 19:26:12 When you see an article from a somewhat reputable publication asking "Which essential oil works best for your zodiac sign?" and all you want to do is run to a science book as fast as you can
1993 2018-03-27 19:26:04 Getting my oil changed is potentially the most anxiety inducing thing and I need to do it or my car will fall apart
1994 2018-03-27 19:25:51 Supply & demand, oil industry style. 
No matter what, they’ll only supply it if we pay the prices they demand.

1995 2018-03-27 19:25:51 This is how USA wants to stop Russia from having representatives speaking on Russia”S behalf, Russia should use the opportunity to impose tax on oil, cars, machinery equipment and airplanes imported from EU and USA.

1997 2018-03-27 19:25:08 Probably wouldn’t work out so well in your favor, I work a lot and on the road chasin oil. Might actually hinder your fafsa because of income..unless I can quote and be a stay at home Dad while you take care of us? 
1998 2018-03-27 19:25:05 my oil changing guy be cute af. i think imma come here more often 
1999 2018-03-27 19:25:03 Seen that before.Its 4 years old, quotes reports from over 40 years ago and was written at peak oil prices. Blaming WM for the financial crisis is laughable - sub prime US mortgages kicked that off. Struggle to see how WM had anything to do with it. GERS ok 4yrs ago but not now?

2007 2018-03-27 19:24:02 Kristof lost all of my respect when he showed his ass on Bill Maher’s show against Sam Harris. He’s about as limp-dicked as you can get on issues.
2008 2018-03-27 19:23:56 He has literally equated all pipelines as being oil pipelines for his map. Electricity conduit pipes, natural gas lines, probably sewer and water pipes as well.

2011 2018-03-27 19:23:21 We stop exporting oil and start exporting other things. Astonishing revolution.
2012 2018-03-27 19:23:20 That’s not the only part that is sketchy about it. The whole Petro concept from Venezuela is concerning given their history. (Missed debt payments, low cash reserves, oil pledged as payments for loans)
2013 2018-03-27 19:23:00 Suggesting that all Cambridge Analytical are guilty of is peddling snake oil to their clients, who desperately wanted believe in CA's 'magic'.... (and that the bloke testifying just wants a reality TV gig).

2016 2018-03-27 19:22:30 I’m no oil painting and I’m getting on a bit but; every picture I see of these rabid Corbynista anti Semites looks like some sort of Cro-Magnon throwback. They’re all surly, hard faced and unshaven and that’s just the females. Doesn’t anyone have a laugh anymore? Blimey!
2017 2018-03-27 19:22:30 We Need more Refineries !!   Our country is bursting with oil & gasoline is still over $2.25 a gallon ??   WTF 
2018 2018-03-27 19:22:06 I was getting my oil changed and this girl just swung the door open and was like “Mitchell...Cherry thats a cool name my names Michelle but its spelt weird so people call me Micheal” but im extremely social awkward and hungover so i just laughed
2019 2018-03-27 19:21:59 Just walk off with our dial soap and air wick plug. I just bought a new oil for the damn plug!
2020 2018-03-27 19:21:59 The US producing more oil and refining more oil for fuel than ever get gas prices are on the rise isn't this contradicting each other or the American companies that greedy
2021 2018-03-27 19:21:31 I mean you don’t have to do all meats but I’m sure you would see a difference sooner. If you do eat meats make sure they aren’t fried or drenched in oil. Try to do chicken and fish vs beef and pork
2022 2018-03-27 19:21:00 Hope this is an oil based paint. Oil supporter
2023 2018-03-27 19:21:00 Dunno why they think olive oil is a better idea but sticking with experts
2024 2018-03-27 19:20:55 Allowing this to happen is to give Russia more leverage over other nations that seek to "benefit" from this pipeline. Europe must try to find oil and gas elsewhere a B d deny Russia the power play its attempting to make via Nord Stream.
2025 2018-03-27 19:20:43 WOW are you that broke to buy your own air wick plug, oil, and dial hand wash soap. Shyt.
2026 2018-03-27 19:20:30 Big money and oil, that is what tempered Bush's response. You are right, Big Bro, it is totally uneven.
2027 2018-03-27 19:20:23 You are looking the perfect candidate you won’t find him or her. We need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil or we will keep fighting wars overseas, and focus on renewable energy at the same time. This is not that difficult.
2028 2018-03-27 19:20:11 Oh girl friend..sadly my meditation techniques all require a course to be taken to learn how to do it. What I can suggest is, put some rain or ocean sounds on your phone at a low volume, get those eye patches, buy some lavender oil from Duene Reed in the holistic section & relax
2029 2018-03-27 19:19:46 I need my oil changed 
2030 2018-03-27 19:19:44 The US military/oil memes are funny and everything, but you know the people making them are doing absolute 0 to come up with alternative options for sustainable energy. Our generation thinks they can save the world through pure criticism.
2031 2018-03-27 19:19:20 I totally agree. 100% agree!! I see another war coming. 

#Rosneft #oil
2032 2018-03-27 19:19:17 Why not impose tariffs on oil from the Cantrell mega oil field? That way, Mexico will be forced to use that oil for its own development, and by the time they need their own oil, they will have exported enough to pay for the wall which you won't need, as Mexico will have developed
2033 2018-03-27 19:19:16 Tell me.
 
It’s basically become dislodged from its original hiding place and now fully blocking the canal. Gotta keep softening it up. Doc and audiologist both said olive oil is best.

2036 2018-03-27 19:19:06 Marty Bent says, "China just started trading oil futures contracts based in Yuan. Student loan + credit card + auto loan debt just surpassed $3 TRILLION dollars." We know all fiat eventually goes to 0. The Chinese government can't be "Regime Changed" for rejecting the dollar.
2037 2018-03-27 19:19:05 5 Hour Energy has the distinct feel of a snake oil that people just never lost faith in.
2038 2018-03-27 19:18:55 Relied on oil ... and introduced radical socialism, which Maduro is now turning into outright authoritarian socialism. God help the Venezuelans.
2039 2018-03-27 19:18:55 That’s a shame. I understand you need to obey US policy, but at least spare us the propaganda. I mean, US “legitimate” sanctions against Venezuela have the only goal of getting their hands on Venezuela’s huge oil reserves. They could not care less about the Venezuelan people.
2040 2018-03-27 19:18:47 You denying we’ll get our share of assets?
What about the years when we topped up England’s finances?
What about 40yrs wasted oil & gas revenues?
Wonder why WM are so desperate for us to stay?

2053 2018-03-27 19:16:44 Thank you!! This is important. I feel like you and I will be following the story of how the oil flows for years to come. It will be interesting to see how oil productions and prices will affect countries and wars in 10 years.

2094 2018-03-27 19:10:41 my understanding of it: since so many cleansers tend alkaline, the slight acidity of toner can neutralize anything left on your skin and reduce the chance of your skin drying out and then overcompensating w/ oil.

2099 2018-03-27 19:09:55 Trump at heart is a promoter, con man, snake oil salesman! He ran for President as a publicity stunt to gain stature in the business world! When he won he did not understand he was not competent to be President! He still does not understand that he is the worst President ever!
2100 2018-03-27 19:09:50 Have to give the catapult some credit, better at launching boiling oil. But that is considered a crime of war. So catapults are only used by barbaric individuals, not intellects, like us
2101 2018-03-27 19:09:48 I still like pickles with some dishes. And mustard. And I sometimes use coconut oil. Usually I eat just meat and eggs, without vegetables. But no fruit - too many carbs for me.
2102 2018-03-27 19:09:44 Are u kidding?! I JUST bought a home off-shore drilling kit! I was gonna take the family on an oil expedition this summer.
2103 2018-03-27 19:09:40 So the tax reform package lowered taxes for the middle class and the oil industry? Cool. Thanks for the data. Are there any other industries that now face lower taxes or is it just oil?

2105 2018-03-27 19:09:37 @Valvoline What happened to the sense of urgency at your VIOC stores?  Glaciers move faster than the techs I’m watching while awaiting to get my oil changed. #stuckinmolasses #takingourtime

2110 2018-03-27 19:09:00 This is called a 'Straw-man" argument, Mr. Stay-Puft. Its certainly *hypocritical* for #AB's NDP to put forward legislation of this kind when they're determined to destroy #BC's lakes, rivers, soil & coastline with dirty #tarsands oil & pipelines. *Your* question is just stupid.
2111 2018-03-27 19:08:54 The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.

2129 2018-03-27 19:05:49 As much as I understand that Africa must use its resources to develop, agriculture is a far more sustainable solution to feed the people of Africa.

2148 2018-03-27 19:03:21 Yes, they need to sell their oil and gas. First time they did not adhere to a contract they would lose big time. Basic trade.

2156 2018-03-27 19:02:40 I've been using Black Castor Oil on my scalp recently as an overnight mask and really hope to see results! I've heard many good things about it  But I want to change my whole hair routine as I'm sick and tired of it falling out, breaking... I have bald spots, it's terrible!
2157 2018-03-27 19:02:36 Happens a lot to artists. I’m blown away by the numbers of people who think a commissioned, framed oil portrait out to cost maybe $200.
2158 2018-03-27 19:02:33 " Addition to Constitution?" Lack of basic understanding of document, construction and rational thought that created it is sad. Ed failure

2160 2018-03-27 19:02:27 I believe for this province it’s now an unrealistic goal, with many mining and oil projects on the Horizon
2161 2018-03-27 19:02:23 ah ah ah. that's what I was thinking; but I did not want to throw more oil on the fire.
But,  true, I was imagining the children being taught ad nauseam about GMOs  all year long, and how good they are, and how anti-GMOs are blinded by their ignorance, blah di blah. Poor kids...
2162 2018-03-27 19:02:23 So that must be the big "blue wave" that I have been hearing about.  Kinda smells like a water/vinegar solution, with a hint of patchouli oil.  It's also REALLY stupid.

2194 2018-03-27 18:59:30 Yep. Mosr brands come with a teensy little bottle of mineral oil. A dab on there after will do ya.

I like this brand because they dont overhear easily, even if you're going slow AF. Which I do. Because I'm careful. And @SpookyNom would murder me if I shaved off too much.
2195 2018-03-27 18:59:19 And oil companies always tell lies.

2220 2018-03-27 18:55:07 The Irving family owns a fleet of tankers as well as the only refinery in the Maritimes. They have enough influence to sway politicians into turning a blind eye to their saudi dealings. I think the only way to convince them would be an embargo on foreign oil imports...

2230 2018-03-27 18:53:30 Almost all newish  diesels need fully synthetic oil. It stays runny when cold. Most  under 10 years old have a dpf filter and will need to be marked C3 low Ash on the bottle

2239 2018-03-27 18:52:26 So is jojoba oil. Just because it's not expensive doesn't mean it's any less exciting.

2257 2018-03-27 18:49:33 I think building a pipeline takes the pressure off refining, and I think as Albertans you're also getting screwed. The Oil companies should be paying way more royalties and also looking at training and investment for life after a carbon based economy.

2259 2018-03-27 18:48:57 speaking to mechanics still seems to be outdated wisdom of “old engines need thick oil to stop them drinking”. Personally found keep running them on thin semi/fully synth and keep servicing them and they’re usually fine.

2293 2018-03-27 18:45:39 I think they did care back when they bought the team and had Nolan and Greenberg on board and oil money was keeping it green. Then the Series happened and all that excitement. Then things went downhill - the Fielder fiasco, Choo choked, and the new park is their only hope for $$.

2318 2018-03-27 18:42:22 CCHR/Szasz is not seeking the eradication of psychiatry, they are seeking the eradication of the psychiatric industry. The fact you do not know the difference is terrifying. That's like inferring someone is anti-natural resource development because they are against Big Oil.
2319 2018-03-27 18:41:56 Honestly, if we can't do something that actually helps people, I'd rather spend tax dollars on a ridiculous wall than bombs and drones. Maybe we could engrave the names of innocents who died for oil (oops..."freedom").
2320 2018-03-27 18:41:27 And one more thing we have more shares than eny other oil companies and no oil so far. IMHO I think IOW will be another lie... I hope I am wrong, I trust that man, probably like many of you. Now I be happy with 8p I am sorry for my negativity but this is how I feel tonight.

2325 2018-03-27 18:40:28 Again, the old Democrats won the union issue in the Post WW2 glory years (1948 - 1973) with fairly conservative social and foreign policy issues.  Between the Vietnam failure/protesting and Oil Shock 1970s Inflationary Recession broke the union issue.

2376 2018-03-27 18:34:58 Blame your government...they are art of part of the "coalition" bombing the middle east for oil resources and pipelines to the E.U. Part of the pact was to take the refugees that are rendered homeless after the bombings. Don't like refugees? then stop bombing them.
2377 2018-03-27 18:34:53 what drive the world are not technology, internet, crude oil, politicians, but dreams and believes
2378 2018-03-27 18:34:49 It’s just a astringent ima have to try the tea tree oil now tho. I’ve only used that in my beard
2379 2018-03-27 18:34:49 Downside is 70% 
Upside 300/400% 
One way to do it is, await Oil Strike RNS buy at 50% higher for a potential 100/200% return risk free
2380 2018-03-27 18:34:37 I had super long hair in high school, i massaged argon oil into my scalp every night before bed and put it up in a bun and washed it with reg shampoo the next morning. Took a biotin supplement daily. And dont use heat on it!!!

2388 2018-03-27 18:33:50 I had a fight with hot oil too not long ago, wasn't the most pleasant experience  Hope it feels better soon @itshaileyreese 
2389 2018-03-27 18:33:40 Is dropping.
Governments do not understand nor do they care about Our Earth as we know she is alive and breaths, the oil is our blood they suck up, the dirt is ourbodies in layers.

2391 2018-03-27 18:33:24 Pro tip: don’t spray oil based perfume while wearing a chiffon style shirt  Result = big dark splotches EVERYWHERE
2392 2018-03-27 18:33:22 Make the switch boo. Literally one drop of oil thoroughly rubbed on your skin can leave you more shine free with a young glow than using Matte products can
2393 2018-03-27 18:33:14 Thank You! That’s My Baby  Did You Get An Oil Change!?
2394 2018-03-27 18:33:09 Two oil paintings reframed in silver mouldings by @roma_moulding and @larsonjuhl . They had large gold frames on them, which overwhelmed the paintings. A great update for these little paintings. #ifyouloveitreframeit #originalart #customframing

2401 2018-03-27 18:31:29 My white Jesus(TM) a guy without any post secondary education is having trouble finding work?!  We need to fire a bunch of teacher and nurses so this we can subsidize oil and gas and get this guy a job, he probably has quads he needs to pay off.
2402 2018-03-27 18:31:26 Then you got oil on them
2403 2018-03-27 18:31:13 Ha, oh!! Nice! What benefits does that bring? A friend of mine scrapes oil along her body with a special little wood tool, I thought maybe that's what you were referring to
2404 2018-03-27 18:30:32 Planning out places to drill for oil?
2405 2018-03-27 18:30:26 As in the world (rest of) owns our power ( gas , electric and oil) . Where do they get their pretentions from? Too much Eton mess?
2406 2018-03-27 18:30:14 I'd say it's cuz we weren't viewed as a threat like countries in South America who similarly have oil. The US wouldn't stand for successful socialism in it's "back yard". Norway has always been an a loyal servant to US policy and that's the only reason we could keep control.
2407 2018-03-27 18:30:07 Getting an oil change always turn into hella other shit..

2410 2018-03-27 18:29:00 Thanks! I do a little blemish removal and smoothing if I look like an oil slick, but I try to accurately represent myself. I feel like anything else is lying.
2411 2018-03-27 18:28:59 Does it contain palm oil?
2412 2018-03-27 18:28:50 Definitely should've brought a book to my oil change 
2413 2018-03-27 18:28:32 After washing your face , take a cotton pad and tea tree oil and wipe your face. Thank me later 
2414 2018-03-27 18:28:23 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

2416 2018-03-27 18:28:20 I start with penetrating oil. If that doesn’t work after 24 hours I have a small butane torch that heat the pedal spindle up. If that doesn’t work then it’s time to grab a 4’ metal pipe to add leverage to the end of a pedal wrench or Allen key. Also make sure you are loosening!!!
2417 2018-03-27 18:27:58 No kidding! I hope it heals up quickly!

Yes, the money was just too good and the promoters of fracking were pushing the "but it's not as bad as oil" environmental aspect. Ugh.
2418 2018-03-27 18:27:58 We're exporting climate change and profiting from it all the while doing little to reduce our own emissions  (except for a one time reduction in one sector which we want to let us off the hook for all the other increasing emissions in other sectors oil, transportation etc)
2419 2018-03-27 18:27:57 Ya know when you take your car in to get an oil change and they find like 100 things wrong with your car? Yeah that happened today and the mechanic told me “you’d honestly be better off just buying a new car”  fuck my life
2420 2018-03-27 18:27:55 Make sure you’re using coconut oil or stretch mark cream or something even after the baby is born. I didn’t have a single mark until after Madilyn was born and I started losing weight. Now I have tons bcus I didn’t think I’d get any after 
2421 2018-03-27 18:27:49 There is already heavy oil in TMX Line 1. You do the math and tell me what happens when there is a dedicated heavy oil line
2422 2018-03-27 18:27:47 Day 3: Ran out of spinach for lunch and just downed spoonfuls of oil. What have I become??
Also too much cheese; need to go casein free 
2423 2018-03-27 18:27:38 spent the rest of my food money for the week getting the fucking oil in my fucking car changed. even though I am hemmoraging money to have this car. brb. going to cry.
2424 2018-03-27 18:27:35 I suspect most Americans do not realize this,  and the numerous ways it impacts them, empowers illegal aliens even if they don't vote.
2425 2018-03-27 18:27:29 Rotary engines are hard work to look after mate, need constant oil checks and maintenance to keep working well, try looking into a v6 engine swap
2426 2018-03-27 18:26:44 While ignoring Amazon...conveniently. Were JD Rockefeller here he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell govt anti-trust "make my day, punks"
2427 2018-03-27 18:26:32 Grape seed oil (natural antibiotic), Passion flower (needs to be taken everyday, soothes nerves & improves insomnia), having more magnesium in your diet also helps.

A crystal to wear; charoite
2428 2018-03-27 18:26:28 You do know that our government spends Billions importing oil from other countries right? Meanwhile, we have oil here that our workers could be getting out of the ground and keeping oil jobs going.  Your statement makes zero sense.
2429 2018-03-27 18:26:15 can see that happening esp in current oil climamate with an even bigger drill H2. Would be an absolute frenzy. But the low risk option is to wait on sidelines with hawk eyes. Im happy to have some skin in as either way SP will be higher than 13p in lead up to H2 drill.
2430 2018-03-27 18:26:14 Get on the cannabis oil 
2431 2018-03-27 18:25:53 Just a thought. Russia i believe is going back to gold. China i heard is switching to a petro based currency.. The US is heavy on oil pruduction right now. What if we are paying our debt to china in oil ass gold is redistributing #Qanon8chan

2435 2018-03-27 18:25:30 Did you say OIL
2436 2018-03-27 18:25:29 No one is actually advocating for a repeal of the second amendment, we just want common sense reform. Then again, the right and common sense mix like oil and water.
2437 2018-03-27 18:25:23 It's been a productive morning. I've scrubbed the shower, cleaned the toilet, and vacuumed my room. All so I can put off leaving the house to get an oil change.
2438 2018-03-27 18:25:15 Good news from an exposure of corrupt system POV.  Good news for trophy hunters also as cogs in the wheels of change move slowly. Trump admin stack the EPA with oil goons, wildlife conservation panel with trophy hunters, then plays golf while kids march for their lives. #Trump=
2439 2018-03-27 18:25:12 Ethical oil. Norway faces same argument. World still needs oil, best come from NL, etc...
2440 2018-03-27 18:25:04 Mature. All that name calling something you’ve learned from the alt-right or is that pure Patrick? Hope your Big Oil sponsors are proud.
2441 2018-03-27 18:24:54 The 1 billion plus barrels of oil that Hibernia has produced so far, which the government never seems to stop celebrating, is now 490 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere
2442 2018-03-27 18:24:45 I change my oil myself be cause i have to not because i want to .Miki King whew wee that was powerful.
2443 2018-03-27 18:24:39 Yes!
It’s similar to snake oil.

2444 2018-03-27 18:24:16 Desastre!. Tributarista?. Lo reduce a una cuestión de "mensualidad"/"anualidad" del tributo "percibido" (según esos términos). Oil es contribuyente de derecho del impuesto, generador del H.I. y deudor por cta.propia. Declaró y adeudó. LPT solo vía As.Ilicit./Insolv.Fiscal.Fraud.
2445 2018-03-27 18:24:16 people use butter or oil to make quesadillas? i've have never once done this in my life
2446 2018-03-27 18:24:05 These species have been so traumatized by the creation of palm plantations.  Palm oil is in the vast majority of human products. Pepsico huge culprit.  Google it.  I hope we wake up before it's too late for them.   We are not the only sentient being on the planet that knows fear.
2447 2018-03-27 18:23:47 We remember our old shitty currencies. US loves its oil/blood backed green paper.
2448 2018-03-27 18:23:41 Yo that sounds like an amazing dip if you put them all together, with a lil bit of olive oil, salt and pepper

2451 2018-03-27 18:22:57 Though, I was only a caregiver, I know your pain- physical and emotional. Just stay strong. There was a period my wife's facial skin was breaking and bleeding. Rubbing pure honey combined with coconut oil helped us. Praying for you.
2452 2018-03-27 18:22:51 Asian oil miller singling the poor quality of Manitoba soybeans this year, says low protein and oil makes it worth $45 USD less than ONT.
2453 2018-03-27 18:22:47 Re: Clean or not clean oil, important to remember that most emissions from fuels come when the fuel is burnt and consumed, and not when it is produced.
2454 2018-03-27 18:22:43 We've got one very similar. Daughter suggested oily or squeak as she looks like she's stood in oil.
2455 2018-03-27 18:22:31 Waiting for a oil change sucks but at least they free for while 
2456 2018-03-27 18:22:23 At 6.02pm a car collided with a lamp post on Alexandra Road Lytham St Annes and @StAnnesFire responded, administering first aid to casualties (who were not trapped in the vehicle) and ensuring there were no remaining hazards in respect of fire, spilled fuel or oil, or debris.

What is "Oil alliance"?
2458 2018-03-27 18:22:18 Can it be  summer already.... overdue for my tan lines and coconut oil 
2459 2018-03-27 18:22:16 Dear Trump/Zinke fans - Please stop falling for their lies.  They only care how much $ oil/gas/mining donors make off #publiclands.  Public lands belong to all of us and Zinke doesn't give a rip that he's taking them out of our hands, @NatResources GOP are all in on his plan.

And dropping into a vat of boiling oil.

2464 2018-03-27 18:21:52 *Step 2: Wash your saucepan and dry it with a napkin*
*Step 3: Break the two eggs and pour their contents into a clean dish*
*Step 4: Stear it well. Add few slices of onion, or any vegetable of your choice.
*Step 5: Place the saucepan over fire and pour a little cooking oil in it
2465 2018-03-27 18:21:45 He prepared to start selling oil in 
non-dollar currencies.

Threatening the petro-dollar equals to suicide.

I feel he was a guy that matured / grew to match the responsibilities and expectations projected upon him, by his people.
And he loved his people.

2467 2018-03-27 18:21:19 I'm a sucka for trying stuff. But...try Lavender oil. I rub a little on my temples and I put a little under my nose before bed. Not sure why, but I sleep all night. I hope it works for you.
2468 2018-03-27 18:21:18 True for electricity generation. Who uses oil for that? Hardly anyone. Since solar and wind are not always available we need base load - done by coal, nuclear or hydro. Even green kings #Denmark and #Germany rely heavily on #coal or #nuclear from France.

Electric transportation?
2469 2018-03-27 18:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2470 2018-03-27 18:21:06 Who out there uses a natural fragrance? I'm not talking about essential oils or essential oil blends. I have tried several of those and it's just not what I'm looking for. 

Had anyone tried either of these??
2471 2018-03-27 18:20:55 News flash, oil and gas companies hire people. This is a good thing.

2. Maxicare Engine Coating - sprayed some kind of protective oil on top of engine. Why does Engine need protection from top when there is a hood ?

2476 2018-03-27 18:20:24 Of all course we know Oil co. Employ people with higher than average salaries,stock prices up. ,go to 401k of everyone contributing to it! (Seems the only problem Democrats Have,is That They Can't Distribute This Money To Where They Want) "Socialist Controlled Society"
2477 2018-03-27 18:20:16 Not really! Am planning to go into Environmental Geochemistry; particularly remediation of abadoned mine and oil spillage site
2478 2018-03-27 18:20:11 Not saying that at all! This is about oil tankers having accidents with disastrous consequences here in Metro Vancouver and along BC's coast! It's about stopping this today, so we don't have to worry about it with every tomorrow! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli
2479 2018-03-27 18:20:06 Is the lifecycle well to tailpipe carbon per barrel of NL offshore oil less than sun crude from the oil sands? Yes. But if you produce large amounts of oil you're still pumping and burning huge amount of carbon, and atmosphere doesn't care where each tonne of CO2 comes from
2480 2018-03-27 18:19:57 It is virtually certain that President #Trump will end the nuclear deal with #Iran in May and that #Oil prices will rise as a result of at least 500k barrels per day coming off of supply.

2482 2018-03-27 18:19:23 1 of them may be BB2 sidetrack
2483 2018-03-27 18:19:09 Myers makes a point regarding the supply of cars, yet fails to join the dots, that more cars has turned the value of oil from worthless to a valuable commodity.

Its the same with all natural resources, including "location". The supply of labour/capital, increases its value.
2484 2018-03-27 18:19:07 Trump really needs to use his deal making skills to get as many of those countries buying oil and gas from Russia to get these items from US
2485 2018-03-27 18:19:06 Damn you’d think your tweet was made out of oil the way these marines swarmed in.
2486 2018-03-27 18:18:37 i impulsively decided to skip my class... to get my oil changed haha rebelll
2487 2018-03-27 18:18:33 Pusiste en general, no sabe a quien te referís. Uno habla sin saber por dentro bien que es lo que está pasando, todos tenemos derechos a reclamar por lo que realmente nos merecemos. Ya sea Oil, los maestros, o lo que sea q tengamos que defender.

2494 2018-03-27 18:17:22 Went home saying “don’t forget to put on the oil” over and over again. And I forgot 
2495 2018-03-27 18:17:21 How about defending our oil&gas industry??
2496 2018-03-27 18:17:21 มันใช้ไม่ได้กับทุกเรื่อง แต่บางเรื่องที่โดนเปรียบเทียบก็เกินไป

2500 2018-03-27 18:16:35 YES. I had a mirror looked at when getting my oil changed and they were like um, that’ll be $550. Dad was like heck no. Think he got it done for $50.
2501 2018-03-27 18:16:32 The GOP only cares about the GOP, the NRA, and the Oil Companies. Unfortunately the Most if the American public didn’t see it coming.
2502 2018-03-27 18:16:18 Shoutout to my grandparents for making sure I could cook, do my own laundry, change a tire, check my oil etc BEFORE I moved out 
2503 2018-03-27 18:16:18 I'm not defending, I just am amazed at the hypocrisy. So taking donations by repressive/oil rich countries is ok? ANY foreign donation or influence I strong condemn, can you say the same?
2504 2018-03-27 18:16:15 I know I’m grown but I’m still spoiled so my Dad bout to pay for my oil change. 
2505 2018-03-27 18:16:14 Thank you
2506 2018-03-27 18:16:10 Definitely strange to hear about the involvement of a Russian oil company in all this...

2508 2018-03-27 18:15:58 Yes but when it runs out (it will eventually). What will we do then eh. Why wait for the day to come? I know we will use oil still but we can reduce our dependency significantly. Climate change isn't based on Co2 alone either. We gotta deal with methane for example.
2509 2018-03-27 18:15:55 Technically you can with vegetable oil.
2510 2018-03-27 18:15:46 But coconut oil clogs pores so....L to them
2511 2018-03-27 18:15:44 When asked - by me - about the morality of maximizing oil production in the face of climate change he said our oil is clean oil, cleaner than Alberta's.
2512 2018-03-27 18:15:40 By opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline & other Canadian pipelines, @SierraClub helps Saudi Arabia & OPEC counties maintain their market share & dominance for exporting heavy sour crude oil to the United States Gulf Coast refining region while trashing union construction jobs.

2514 2018-03-27 18:15:26 Hahahaha yeah...quick wash and bears oil. Sorted!
2515 2018-03-27 18:15:16 We hear same thing. If we cut back on ppl taking jobs Americans can't live on, lower skilled, less educated the country will spiral down. 
2516 2018-03-27 18:15:11 Athena’s with her grandma so it’s relax time for me. Stress away oil in the diffuser, drinking green tea & took my cbd syrup

2519 2018-03-27 18:15:04 Para poner un sistema de riego debe haber agua con calidad y en cantidad. Si se ponen bombas es probable que los pueblos no tengan agua para tomar. Por otra parte el costo de la electricidad ó gas oil segun el caso, lo hace económicamente inviable.
2520 2018-03-27 18:15:00 i know, and now we synthesize these and other plant compounds out of oil by-products and mix them with all sorts of shelf-life preservatives into a pill that is riduculously expensive without insurance
2521 2018-03-27 18:14:59 No lo digo por eso, sino me equivoco las dos de ayer ninguna fue por oil 
2522 2018-03-27 18:14:57 OLIVE OIL
2523 2018-03-27 18:14:52 You dont need oil you just need to fu off.
2524 2018-03-27 18:14:46 Lol yeah that’s pretty shameful. Maybe try for dumplings instead? Deluxe green bo has super good ones. They are mean and cash only but the peanut sauce and chili oil is worth it!
2525 2018-03-27 18:14:32 Me either!  Dang, I never thought I would say this, but I sure do miss the days of OKIE  OIL MAN ! Simple straight up story telling and lying but no BAT SHIT CRAZY STUFF like now in dinarland
2526 2018-03-27 18:14:30 No podemos discutir este chiquitaje. 1ro. que aparezcan los grandes números (obra pública; los impuestos retenidos x OIL). Después el resto.

2528 2018-03-27 18:14:14 I was just (kinda) asked out while getting my oil changed ...feel like this ends with me having to change car places 

Luckily it’s just my oil change place, not my repair place because it’s near impossible to find a repair place that doesn’t try to screw over a single woman

2530 2018-03-27 18:14:06 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
2531 2018-03-27 18:14:01 I’m gonna shower and tan naked. But tanning oil is coconut oil. Wanna catch skin cancer? Listen to me.
2532 2018-03-27 18:13:53 Your weak and ignorant, money is nothing, oil is nothing, genocide is not to be excused. You have murdered 2 million civilian arabs in 10 years.
2533 2018-03-27 18:13:43 No, seven times more oil tankers than what we have sailing out today. That's just for starters, the projections have already gone up from 32 to 40 and the pipeline isn't even built. This isn't the English Channel! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli
2534 2018-03-27 18:13:34 Won't make the playoffs next year
2535 2018-03-27 18:13:19 Had a great time in the Dart Valley. Found Pearl-bordered Fritillary larvae, Violet Oil Beetle and Bloody-nosed Beetle. A wonderful place to explore. Good luck with the blog!
2536 2018-03-27 18:13:18 People who use coconut oil on their faces wipe back to front
2537 2018-03-27 18:13:11 It disrupts Big Oil’s deathgrip on Congress, which plays second fiddle only to the NRA terrorist group.
2538 2018-03-27 18:13:07 Dinosaurs are apex predators even in death, as through oil pollution and wars over oil, dinosaurs are still raking up an impressive killcount despite being extinct for millions of years.

2546 2018-03-27 18:12:19 Ha Ha Ha In English then, we import lots of the diesel we use from Russia. We do not have the facilities to refine more Oil to get diesel. Next time you want bread I will give you flour !!!
2547 2018-03-27 18:12:09 I'm placing an essential oil order that will process tomorrow and has 2 days shipping  (after processing) if anyone needs anything let me know and I can add you to my order :)

2571 2018-03-27 18:09:34 Mineral oil (vaseline, baby oil) is a petroleum product and doesn't absorb into your skin. It forms a protective barrier on top so your skin doesn't dry out. Only natural plant and animal oils actually moisturize your skin.

2578 2018-03-27 18:08:54 The provision of temporary replacement water supplies is also expensive. Cabot Oil & Gas reported having spent at least $193,000 on replacement water for homes with contaminated water in Dimock, Pennsylvania.

2580 2018-03-27 18:08:44 And Gas is 115.9  and alberta has to discount their oil just to sell it
2581 2018-03-27 18:08:35 Exactly. What's disturbing about this is that the UNFCCC is taking an oil company's word on climate action at face value
2582 2018-03-27 18:08:31 Gotta get an oil change that I don’t want to pay for.

2603 2018-03-27 18:05:21 But officially, in terms of actually helping figure out what a pathway to decarbonization looks like. What role should Shell and other oil companies play in that?
2604 2018-03-27 18:05:10 Ah, you mean when the chemical experts, satellite imagery and witnesses came forward that told us Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq could kill us all in 45 mins?  Ah, no, that's right, it was A LIE. No WMDs, the 'experts&witnesses' lied, but hey, we've got their oil, right?

300ml water
spoon or two of oil
7g pack of dry yeast (dissolve in part of the water with tablespoon of sugar)
little bit of salt.

2640 2018-03-27 18:00:19 Enjoy away like I said.  I'm happily watching Connor shred.  Just those who think we've turned the corner I suggest proceed with caution and look at how the team finished each year in decade of darkness.  Lots of strong finishes that meant nothing.

2645 2018-03-27 17:59:50 Oh yes, khichdi, is my "sick people's food," used as comfort food. I like ooverboiled ginger jal, but with huldee and honey, no milk. I do the shot of huldee, honey, water and olive oil only when I'm sick. For sore throat, nutmeg powder, amla powder, ground cinnamon and honey.
2646 2018-03-27 17:59:47 It's the small things ... stopped in to schedule an oil change for the Wrangler and the service manager asked "How about right now?" So I am driving a loaner Dodge Dart. Interesting change from the Wrangler.

2667 2018-03-27 17:57:33 'We import lots of diesel from Russia'

Really? I thought we imported crude oil from all over the world and refined it here to make diesel.

2669 2018-03-27 17:57:17 Agreed it's likely derailler-related. The salt is super bad for mine. It's been squeaking. Putting chain oil in all the moving bits and shifting up and down several times worked for me... until the next time I need to oil it again.

2678 2018-03-27 17:56:35 Are oil wells considered infrastructure?

2698 2018-03-27 17:54:56 I'd say you are pretty much correct on all points. I would also like to add that somewhere in this mix the oil sanctions were to come off hence Rex Tillerson as Sec of State. But 45 screwed that up for them. Still alot to play out.
2699 2018-03-27 17:54:56 Installing a single offshore wind turbine can take 18,857 barrels of oil, which is quite a bit when you consider offshore turbine arrays can have up to 100 separate turbines. That’s not even counting lubrication oil, mind you.

2782 2018-03-27 17:45:43 Dinosaurs are apex predators even in death, as through oil pollution and wars over oil, dinosaurs are still raking up an impressive killcount despite being extinct for millions of years.

2792 2018-03-27 17:44:38 Terrorism to combat terrorism is NOT the answer. Never hurt anybody unless you're defending yourself or you're just the same as the people you claim to despise. Put wings aside and come together, look at the facts, who creates nutters? It's the arms companies and oil drillers..
2793 2018-03-27 17:44:36 How does a "healthy and necessary conversation" include burning fossil fuels at roughly the same rate we do today in 2050? It's grossly out of step with even conservative decarbonization pathways, at least those that aren't written by oil companies..
2794 2018-03-27 17:44:34 He is devious, but I'm not sure he's "smarter". Hitler became unbalanced later in the war, but let's not forget he took Germany from hyperinflation to marching down the streets of Paris and Moscow suburbs. He didn't have nukes, oil or gas like Putin. 100% agree with last line tho

2797 2018-03-27 17:44:12 Do you think that's why he authorized bombing Syria, sold weapons to Ukraine, increased imports of gas and oil to Poland and others to hurt Russia's energy industry, and expelled Russian ambassadors?
2798 2018-03-27 17:44:06 ぅぅ…。なんだか辛くなってきたぞ
2799 2018-03-27 17:44:05 Why yes, I did just boil chunks of baguette in hot oil. No,  this is Kosher salt not sea salt. They're not croutons, they're snacks. The more rustic the French cooking =the more nervous I am. Deep-fried bread=very nervous. Who's watching the Nukes? #Mars
2800 2018-03-27 17:43:53 Also if you want to make a ton of money right now move to north Dakota and work on the oil rigs. They take people with little or no skills and pay them tons. It's just hard work and a dangerous job so few take it up.

2809 2018-03-27 17:43:06 You do realize this is just lining the pockets of oil excecs. The average person sees non of this besides maybe if they sell yachts.
2810 2018-03-27 17:43:04 I cook mine with sea salt, pepper, rosemary, and basil. Cooked in coconut oil > olive oil.

2814 2018-03-27 17:42:37 Half of my mind is planning on going to the bank, paying off my card, my bills, talking about house options and likely getting my oil changed and tire plugged 

The other half wonders how many skittles I can fit in my mouth

I’m almost an adult
2815 2018-03-27 17:42:34 Who works in the oil industry Bernie? Oh yeah! A lot of people in the middle class.
2816 2018-03-27 17:42:30 CANT SLICK A CAN OF OIL
2817 2018-03-27 17:42:21 Don't confuse apathy with animosity.  I would bet that if you asked most "wealth management" professionals to tell you why they don't buy energy, the answer will be that they have no money left after buying financials and FAANG's, so don't even bother looking at them.
2818 2018-03-27 17:42:20 Hey Sassy, how’re things in the oil patch? You taking in any softball games this season? Hope to see you at a game. And I hope all is well with you and yours. #GoCoogs
2819 2018-03-27 17:42:20 I agree with limiting oil exploration, but Do I really expect to go back to the horse and cart tomorrow
2820 2018-03-27 17:42:12 Went to our fieldtrip for the first time in 3 years todayyyy it was soo fun  the engineers, medics, staffs and all are so nice and welcoming (its Petronas Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal, Kimanis). I was the head of AJK Protocol but Sir Jason (Safety&Health Officer) was very helpful
2821 2018-03-27 17:42:08 Secretary Zinke immediately sold the drilling rights to Bird's ankle to one of his oil and gas buddies.
2822 2018-03-27 17:42:08 Damn what kind of oil you buying & how many quarts you getting?
2823 2018-03-27 17:42:02 Chaps, I think if you get some beard oil and make that sucker look better and rock the buzz cut - I think you’d be in a good spot pal!
2824 2018-03-27 17:42:00 yes, it instead of oil-- the warhawks were all after the enemys piss.
2825 2018-03-27 17:41:43 Wish I did, mom took the olive oil away!!! She doesn't think it's good for me to eat.  Hope you habbing a nice day, it's 41 here, but cloudy.

2829 2018-03-27 17:41:13 Right but if I buy the oil& filter myself from autozone it be like $30. So it’s not much of a price difference.

2831 2018-03-27 17:41:09 Don't forget that ALL companies received a large cut in their federal taxes.  Not sure why all of this complaining from oil $ gas industry.

2841 2018-03-27 17:39:18 I will celebrate #MuslimWomensDay by praying for the 16 y/o Muslim girl from the UK who refused to marry who her parents chose for her, so her mom & dad threw hot oil on her face.
2842 2018-03-27 17:39:07 May God reward you and your family. The so called "youths" are over 50yrs, buhari makes move to strip Danjuma of the illegally acquired oil wells he started screaming........etc. Nigerians be wise

2844 2018-03-27 17:38:46 We can definitely do that! We just leave it in the oil a little less longer because it helped reduce the oil content a bit

2849 2018-03-27 17:38:19 Aside from one reference to @CEAA_ACEE Finance Minister @TomOsborneMHA's budget speech only contains references to the economic and business environment, lots of references to oil development though
2850 2018-03-27 17:37:56 World oil use is presently 97 million barrels a day and as the third world pulls out of poverty world oil use is forecast to increase to 110 million barrels a day. You will have to accept that fact

2852 2018-03-27 17:37:46 The state is raising taxes on cigs, gas, hotel rates, and oil/gas production to pay for the teacher raises.  Also, the state will allow ball (roulette) and dice games.

2854 2018-03-27 17:37:27 Hello! 
Our tofu is not considered vegan because we fry it in the same oil as we our fried chicken. Because the tofu is in indirect contact with meat, we can not consider it 100% vegan. 
We hope it answers your question! 
Best,
Anna

2856 2018-03-27 17:37:13 Unfortunately the squeaky wheel got all the oil in CA.  Most of the state is conservative . Because libs control Hollywood & media it seems the entire state agrees. Brown ruined CA. Best thing that could happen is a new state. Won't be another lib prez from that area again.

2863 2018-03-27 17:36:38 Can Skunkworks get invaded by the U.S. military? Because I'm just daydreaming about a world that has no use for oil.
2864 2018-03-27 17:36:36 “Developed free democracies” is white liberal speak for “white countries.” They never include Brasil and their 40,000 gun murders because well, brown people aren’t civilized or something.
2865 2018-03-27 17:36:33 Honey, big pharm is right there with big oil & the NRA in terms of pushing politicians to do whats best for THEM not you or I. Not a good argument. Secondly, to wade into the mental health requires HIPAA laws removed, and no ones giving up their personal med recs to gun shops...

2873 2018-03-27 17:35:38 No we didn’t. We sparked a healthy and necessary conversation about the planned decarbonization pathway of one of the world’s oil and gas majors, which has at least proposed a plan to meet the #ParisAgreement goals.
2874 2018-03-27 17:35:35 These are the 4 steps a rag takes to argue on Twitter: 

1. Denial - They deny facts even when you provide evidence.

2. Discredit - Once they realise they’re wrong they mention oil or no fans.

3. Insult - Call you a nonce etc. 

4. Block you.

Weak, pathetic individuals.

2878 2018-03-27 17:35:18 No they dont you should remember that when you rail about cutting entitlements,when the truth is the real issue is corporate welfare,(see military spending/oil company subsides and tax cuts for wealthy.)

2891 2018-03-27 17:34:10 I’ve found that at that point, if you wax or oil it, it doesn’t give the best finish. It sort of shows up the sanding  I’d say go all the way on sanding & then add the character back in. Or paint it as it is?  @picapicahome

2894 2018-03-27 17:34:03 @AliceTeller It's frustrating. We were a poor ag state for centuries. Our blacks built ranches, farmed, started oil firms, same as any white person. They built a premiere black college five miles from state uni. They had towns w/ fine architecture, too.

2899 2018-03-27 17:33:23 My perfect insurance plan:
Only plans for catastrophic care. Similar to what car insurance is. Costs dramatically will decrease. 

Just like your car needs oil changes every now and then does your car insurance pay for it? No. Let’s do something similar with health insurance.

For 500ml oil why r u charging 175 rs.
Which was previously 150 rs. Just Loot is going on of common man.

2908 2018-03-27 17:32:41 (2/2) You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” Luke 6:44-47

2912 2018-03-27 17:32:02 2. One pan stuffed grilled chicken and seasonal veg. Seasoned Chicken breast sliced open and stuffed with low fat mozzarella and tomato paste. Some veg like peppers, asparagus, etc. Olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and red onions. In the oven. Done!
2913 2018-03-27 17:31:58 Really!! I’m guessing it helps with spots and blocked pores if it’s getting rid of the hair that traps the oil??? Think I’m gonna have to book one ! Xx
2914 2018-03-27 17:31:48 Hey @GarnierUK - have you changed the ingredients in your oil infused micelles water?? Been using it for ages and never had a problem, just used a new bottle and my face is now all red, blotchy and itchy...? Help!
2915 2018-03-27 17:31:46 I got an essential oil diffuser bracelet or something and I've just been walking around sniffing my arm all day am I doing it right?
2916 2018-03-27 17:31:19 #China’s yuan-denominated crude oil futures launched 62,500 contracts traded in aggregate, over 62 million barrels of #oil changed hands for a notional volume around 27 billion yuan (over $4 billion) $UUP
2917 2018-03-27 17:31:10 Trivia: Bhut Jolokia is from my home town Tezpur. I keep a whole bottle of it pickled in mustard oil. Just a few drops of oil is enough.
2918 2018-03-27 17:31:08 Any spots u have can be dealt w a spot treatmeant, or diluted tea tree oil.
2919 2018-03-27 17:31:01 try mixing apple cider vinegar + lemon (you can even add baking soda) and put it on your roots! you can also try baking soda+ jojoba oil + strawberries, orrrr baking soda + lemon juice + jojoba oil! this should help reduce oils
2920 2018-03-27 17:30:58 I need to get some hair skin and nails pills. Im on BC and I’ll try the coconut oil
2921 2018-03-27 17:30:54 Is this one of those trade deals where you buy our Planes we'll buy your Oil?Is that why Quebec is building an Oil terminal capable of off loading ForeignOil?Is Ottawa using revenue from CanadianOil to finance dare I say...
2922 2018-03-27 17:30:48 This budget is a punt. If you blame our woes on PCs, then make the hard choices. We can't keep punting hoping for another oil boom bailout. #nlpoli

2928 2018-03-27 17:30:03 Nope, @jkenney I will suggest you to ask Alberta Oil industry stake holders before going against carbon tax. I did not get answer, If you will get rid of carbon tax how you are planning to keep Alberta oil flowing?
2929 2018-03-27 17:29:57 "You know you don't throw out no oil." The peakest, peakest Black thing you'll ever hear in a Black office. I am slayed.
2930 2018-03-27 17:29:34 I am not one to defend Trudeau, nor the Liberals in general, but I do defend truth.  The initial post is blasting Trudeau for a decline in investment that is almost entirely caused by the crashing of global oil prices that no Canadian politician can materially control.

2935 2018-03-27 17:28:45 You shouldn't use him Nikola Tesla was working on that problem and had the answer at around the same time and the capitalist heads at the time defunded his project and funded Edisons instead, which was run off of oil and coal. Think Tesla as a modern Tesla, and Edison as a hummer
2936 2018-03-27 17:28:44 Until people realize Canada survives off of selling oil & gas and start working on replacing that income FIRST it is delusional to take steps to cripple oil & gas. Perhaps start some solar cell, lithium battery research/factories in Canada? But going broke is not an option.

2955 2018-03-27 17:26:49 Yep. No guarantee. But if we're frightened to start we'll never find out.

Oil is a world market ..we can buy diesel from wherever/whoever we like.

Gas isn't.

2957 2018-03-27 17:26:46 Got my oil changed today. But I’m not sure it actually got changed. The guys thought they would entertain me by having a rap battle. 
2958 2018-03-27 17:26:46 Socialism sucks!!! It really does my good friend Bongino! Keep the fight! A country with enough oil to use it as drinking water can’t manage to have toilet paper!!

2967 2018-03-27 17:26:01 I noticed some of your replies & need to say this: please do not use toothpaste, mustard, ice, lavender oil or even a dressing on this burn. I worked in the burns unit for 2 years. Please do not take advice from people who have not directly worked with burns or are not qualified.
2968 2018-03-27 17:25:58 How come nobody is talking about oil prices spiking under @realDonaldTrump and all the warmongering coming from his administration?
2969 2018-03-27 17:25:54 I would love to rub every inch of your beautiful pantyhosed legs and thighs in baby oil.
2970 2018-03-27 17:25:53 It's layers upon layers of oil production and consumption. It is much more efficient to produce the power at home or locally than recursively fueling ICE vehicles.

and either way it was a dead one you can't be someone who believe that tazing a dead rat it worse that taking the frozen limbs of a dead creature out of the freezer ,chopping it up and then putting it in boiling hot oil before eating it right?

Biore charcoal face wash(night&day) + glamglow supermud face mask(every other night), and tea tree oil (every two nights).
2983 2018-03-27 17:24:03 Don't tell me what to do! I just spent fitty-eighty turdy-ninety on some fully synthetic oil

2985 2018-03-27 17:23:38 What about drilling for oil? Shipping oil? Refining oil? Tanker trucks shipping gas to stations? Diesel for trucks shipping gasoline? Refining diesel?

3011 2018-03-27 17:20:20 If it can't be run any better why are oil companies saying that they have increased production by 200000 bpd through new efficiencies and expect that tho rise to 1000000 bpd through further production improvements. I know cause you talk sheep Shite.

Not trying to argue because I don’t have a dog in the fight, but I know nobody wants 50lbs or have to give up H.P.?

3022 2018-03-27 17:18:58 Graciano. Esto es un mercado libre. Segun explicaron, o le compraban a Argentina o prendían las turninas a gas oil mas caro. Y tener en cuenta que un día solo le compramos por 12 horas. Y poner en fincionamiento las centrales térmicas por 12 hs debe de ser muy complejo

3049 2018-03-27 17:13:04 You see, it can now be said that Frigg, an exquisitely fabulous audacious auburn and grey-eyed INFP oil heiress, holding a wisteria blue railroad vest, strolling nonchalantly with a nervously quivering Irish Sport Horse.
3050 2018-03-27 17:12:59 Darned, I missed it! Did you ask him about the Golan Heights and Genie Oil & Gas?
3051 2018-03-27 17:12:56 constantly smelling like oil is not cute 
i should have picked a different job
3052 2018-03-27 17:12:51 Y pase un tiempo  de reflexión   ...leyendo el informe MacBride
3053 2018-03-27 17:12:50 Love the oil paints and the process discussion. Also a huge Sanderson fan. I love the stories of artists doing fan work and getting commissions out of it. Ben McSweeney said the same happened with him.
3054 2018-03-27 17:12:42 $180 for an oil change lol foreign life 
3055 2018-03-27 17:12:29 At the dealership getting an oil change before I hit the road. Thinking that I sure wish I had someone to come with me. Touring is always way more fun with a friend. Also the coffee was better at the Cadillac dealership 
3056 2018-03-27 17:12:07 It raises LDL, (and HDL), so inflammation net effect depends; but it’s low in Oleic acid and devoid of Stearic acid. Also, no DHA/ADA, butyric acid, or arachidonic acid which is readily available from fish/meats/dairy.  Coconut oil seems fine, but shouldn’t be the only fat source

3059 2018-03-27 17:11:29 I don’t see why. It’s not clear at all.
3060 2018-03-27 17:11:20 I see a lot of tweets regarding the NRA. Here are my thoughts; I feel about the NRA like I do about all lobbyists including the drug steel oil coal etc. industries. Lobbyists should have no influence over congress. The only special interest group they should listen to is the ppl.
3061 2018-03-27 17:11:17 I came in looking for pancakes and bacon. I ordered toasted bruschetta drizzled in olive oil and topped with shaved parmesan, spinach, onions, and eggs. I felt a little fruity so I added a side of corned beef hash. 

Food is GREAT at these Yours Truly restaurants.
3062 2018-03-27 17:11:05 This oil on canvas is really amazing man
3063 2018-03-27 17:11:03 Will be on @trtworld #MoneyTalks shortly to discuss news that Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing a 10-20 year framework for oil policy cooperation. #OOTT
3064 2018-03-27 17:10:55 I enjoy hearing Gordon Ramsay say olive oil. Brightens up my day.
3065 2018-03-27 17:10:45 @thataylaa I've been loving the #15daysofFoundation (it's the 1st 1 I've seen) and just wanted to say your skin looks bomb & thanks for the tip about rosehip oil!!
3066 2018-03-27 17:10:33 Hot oil is better sis .
3067 2018-03-27 17:10:28 plus doing this soaks up any leftover oil in the pan so it's easier to clean lol. handy!!

3071 2018-03-27 17:10:11 The only thing I know about hair care, and that works well for me is using organic coconut oil, it repairs and speeds growth  I put it all over 30 mins before showering, or overnight but that’s a uncomfortable 
It’s good you give time to yourself ejah~

3073 2018-03-27 17:10:04 Nasser told Bloomberg that Aramco was considering a dividend comparable with the 6 percent yield that some big independent oil companies pay investors. “We will be competing with the best for sure,”
3074 2018-03-27 17:09:53 I think that as long as our economy remains based on the oil and gas sector it's going to be sketchy at best. Feast or famine, unless there is a massive shift in how we use that money.
3075 2018-03-27 17:09:50 y saltó a la fama hasta en el otro lado del charco!!! Decimos y por allá rodooooó....

3084 2018-03-27 17:08:36 Well I think we've agreed that, as per that webpage, the increase in tankers in the Salish Sea outside the harbour is no where near "seven-fold". That's self evident. As to traffic in the harbour, yes, there's a seven-fold increase in oil tankers. 1/

3087 2018-03-27 17:08:00 It’s the soft sautéed kind. I did a mix of salted butter (2 tbsp) and canola oil (some tbsp?) in a cast iron skillet on medium heat. Once the butter started to foam, I would drop the slices in. The sizzle should be vigorous. Wait a few and then flip once caramelization starts.

3090 2018-03-27 17:07:25 Did the WV Oil Marketers & Grocers Association or other grocery stores (Kroger, Target, Wal-Mart, etc.) weigh in on this? Seems losing $17mil of biz would be something they would oppose.

3093 2018-03-27 17:07:09 Do you put oil in it? That’ll help with the frizz!!
3094 2018-03-27 17:07:00 It was a pleasure @AshdenePrimary, lots of great questions from the children and they had remembered lots of facts from another parent’s talk last week on oil too. Very impressed RD

3096 2018-03-27 17:06:38 It’s oil extracted from marijuana but without the thc. My son uses it.
3097 2018-03-27 17:06:32 ....and the railroad tycoons and Standard Oil. Monopolies and Oligopolies tend to bring that reaction out in people through imperfect market abuse
3098 2018-03-27 17:06:30 I just hit a pothole and I swear I felt it hit my soul. Drove all the way home with the music off. She already needs an oil change, transmission flush and new breaks so she ain't feelin well

Surprise! Surprise! All "competitors" have done the same! Go figure...
3106 2018-03-27 17:05:26 Could you clarify which situation. I mean the al quaeda was funded through saudi oil among other things.
3107 2018-03-27 17:05:19 Dandy $812M deficit this year, folks. Deficits like this were totally avoidable after all the oil billions! And I love this:

"In a year's time, the province will have an estimated net debt of $15.5 billion on the books — nearly double the level of a decade ago." (CBC)
3108 2018-03-27 17:05:03 Makes perfect sense they are such soar arsehole losers
Gaddafi wanted a gold standard for Africa and paid in gold rather than worthless dollars for oil

Venezuela was poor and vulnerable to international oil prices and got hammered. We should be able to do much bettr

3116 2018-03-27 17:03:56 Hot shower, stretching, massage the muscles with some type of oil (it’ll help loosen em up), drink water, and be patient. 
3117 2018-03-27 17:03:53 Nothing like used oil 
3118 2018-03-27 17:03:31 Believe that. Soon you will only be driving the new vehicle for oil changes and maintenance. Especially in winter if it has remote start and heated seats.
3119 2018-03-27 17:03:04 I use LUSH products, Damaged Hair Mask and R&B as a moisturiser. Coconut oil in general is really good, especially is you use is at night and plait your hair as a protective to sleep in. You may want to wash it out in the morning but I usually just style and go

3126 2018-03-27 17:02:19 We cannot depend on oil revenue alone to run Nigeria. We need Nigerians and foreign investors to start paying corporate tax, import duty tax, investment tax, real estate tax, sales tax, business ownership tax and payroll tax.

3129 2018-03-27 17:01:54 I remember, when I was in college and cholesterol was the nutritional devil of the moment, seeing tins of olive oil proclaiming NO CHOLESTEROL! Never mind that OO wouldn’t have cholesterol in the first place...
3130 2018-03-27 17:01:54 Sitting in a waiting room waiting for my oil change to be done. It's been a nice day so far even though it's raining. Hope y'all are having a good one!
3131 2018-03-27 17:01:54 They’ve helped me quite a lot. I think the shame around anti-depressants is part of why people are now drawn to “this essential oil from civet butts are much more effective” articles.
3132 2018-03-27 17:01:47 This boy came to my job right. Asked something about oil for a car. Look me in my face and said I was pretty . I say thank you. Then I left my job to go run an errand and don’t y’all know this boy waited for me to follow me to where I was going .

3144 2018-03-27 17:01:03 It’s just like macaroni and cheese, but they use a different type of pasta and add truffle oil to it with mor cheeses so it tastes richer. They’ll sometimes throw bacon on it or bake it.

3147 2018-03-27 17:00:40 i'm not debating that at all, there is plenty of "blame" to go around in a season that is very disappointing. from leadership, management, coaching, to the players playing the game. There is nothing wrong with fans enjoying the team as they seem fit, without ridicule.
3148 2018-03-27 17:00:26 Discover the uses of coconut oil! Coconut oil nourishes dry skin, and is a great option for cooking compared to other oils; it does the magic of increasing levels of healthy cholesterol in the body, as well converting the bad cholesterol into

3151 2018-03-27 17:00:07 I remember this well, Denis was lucky not to have his career ended, that bosvelt was a proper prick, went on to play play with #manshitty before they had oil money to buy their success

3168 2018-03-27 16:57:18 That's a lot of pipelines. In saying that, thatnk God all the oil and gas is safely transported by pipeline and not by the ultra dangerous rail/road method. All those piepline and so few leaks...I bet Not even 1% faliure rate, pretty safe environmentally friendly was to transport

3187 2018-03-27 16:55:12 Being an adult is knowing your inspection sticker expired, your oil needs to be changed, and there’s a weird clunking sound you never heard before until now but you just turn your volume up and hope for the best 
3188 2018-03-27 16:55:12 Apparently I'm blocked
3189 2018-03-27 16:55:10 That could be one the first undercard on the unsanctioned Floyd/Conor fight on an oil rig in international waters, along with Raheel vs Giant Rooster.

3193 2018-03-27 16:54:50 Try refined coconut oil in black coffee. You may be surprised. I’m hooked.
3194 2018-03-27 16:54:50 has led the way, i.e. using more automated pumpers in #fracking & fewer workers. The increased use of subcontractors has also reduced the benefits to workers who are employed. Simultaneously, it's getting harder to find skilled oil worker labor as fewer people want the jobs. /2
3195 2018-03-27 16:54:42 You can’t expect people to sit about moaning ? Nor can you expect people to sit and watch the share drop ! Where will either of those things get me ! We never got it wrong we got sucked into oil pouring videos bollox rns !! No reporting facts what can I do ?

3198 2018-03-27 16:54:37 It's fabricated lies from the outset to discredit President Putin to destabilize him for his work in Syria. The Zionist U.S. wants to create a Greater Israel extending all the way to Syria which is rich in oil more so than Saudi Arabia. Its Iraq all over again.
3199 2018-03-27 16:54:33 With a billion dollars I would build a waterworks that supplies water to King city with water and exports clean water like Oil.
3200 2018-03-27 16:54:27 Better get use of us kid. Soon all political parties will cater to Islam as Islam grows and inshalla, becomes more dominative in politics.  Naturally Islam is advanced thru politics. One world govt under Islam is the goal of all Muslim worldwide.
3201 2018-03-27 16:54:21 That chart perfectly proves my point. The US were in it for the oil. Thanks!

3205 2018-03-27 16:53:34 Shower was nice I put too much baby oil on tho
3206 2018-03-27 16:53:27 Khaira and Strome Centered lines are teetering just above and below 40% goal share and shot share in the last 10+ games during this "surge".   Any notion "the team" has turned a corner is simply untrue.
3207 2018-03-27 16:53:25 The same people who make the 2% disclaimer always conveniently ignore the fact Cada is in the top 5 ranked oil/gas producers in the world.
We don't create the demand, but we're a part of the problem.
3208 2018-03-27 16:53:23 Depends. Oral vs intravenous nutritiion? Complete oil vs individual fatty acids (docosahexaenoic & eicosapentaenoic acid from algae)? Adults, fullterm or preterm neonates? Only some evidence for DHA in brain development of prems & for less inflammation & liver damage in IV use
3209 2018-03-27 16:53:17 Kinda just coming to the realization that I’m going to be 22 tomorrow and I graduate in 5 weeks. Maybe I should learn how to change the oil in my car? Is that a grown up thing?
3210 2018-03-27 16:53:01 If you’re an oil tanker.
3211 2018-03-27 16:52:43 Not specifically no. But the implication is clear... to me at least.
3212 2018-03-27 16:52:42 Me three years ago: "I guess I use this bodywash and maybe use it to wash my face"

Me now: "I have a special bodywash with olive oil for soft skin, a special facewash for tough bearded faces, an oil to help keep my beard soft, and seasalt spray to help my hair be extra soft"
3213 2018-03-27 16:52:37 I do not have a CBD cream specifically, but Krees Skincare offers a Muscle and Joint Massage Cream with an essential oil blend and Kombo butter. Kombo butter,  sourced from Africa is high in myristic acid for pain relief and inflammation
3214 2018-03-27 16:52:18 Of course ?what point am I to blame that B.B. didn’t produce oil ? Did you believe it would ? Because I really really did !! So why am I a bad person for believing that ? You think I’m not fuked off ? I paid my money took the risk !! Comments on a B.B. don’t change the outcome!!

3231 2018-03-27 16:50:43 So imagine: Namjin getting all steamy in the back of a car that namjoon is fixing up and they somehow both end up shirtless and covered in oil 
3232 2018-03-27 16:50:41 You know nothing but the Jew propaganda which brainwashed you. Learn the shariah and Islam, travel to the Kingdom of Islam (Saudi), visit the mujahideen in Afghanistan, and you will really change your racist and islamophobic views.

3234 2018-03-27 16:50:38 CEO John Hess says Liza Phase 1 will be onstream in March 2020 marking first #oil for #Guyana- I believe that is ahead of 2020 elections, which were held in May in 2015 - should be interesting $HES $XOM
3235 2018-03-27 16:50:37 I have oil streaming down my face 
3236 2018-03-27 16:50:29 Unfortunately, not true. The industry has been on a massive cost-cutting spree since the collapse of oil prices, demonstrating how it can do more with less. Less, and less expensive, workers has been a key cost savings. Automation in the field, the refinery, etc., conti'd... /1
3237 2018-03-27 16:50:12 Today the topic of vegan items being cooked on same surfaces or in same oil as meat products. What do y'all think about it? Not vegan? Or does that not negatively contribute to the ethics of veganism?
3238 2018-03-27 16:49:59 Yup, don't need to mention  the brand. Or shud we mention the brand of the car, brand of the oil he was using, the servicing store he had....
3239 2018-03-27 16:49:50 Yes, oil companies want carbon taxes like a prostitute wants to sleep with a 400 pound customer. Right. They don't like it, they simply know that this is what needs to be done to stay in business.
3240 2018-03-27 16:49:48 That would be kinda cool.
3241 2018-03-27 16:49:37 @caffy what are you nuts? Please tell this is a joke. You have looked at earnings estimates for any company in oil right?

3243 2018-03-27 16:49:33 Again, why is it wrong for fans to enjoy the team playing a little better? Getting a few points in an overall disappointing season? Would you be happier if the Oilers lost every game? I don't understand that thought process. 97.. plus 93, 29, 25 and others
3244 2018-03-27 16:49:19 なんか申し訳ないねぇ
3245 2018-03-27 16:49:18 I need them to stop printing me a tree and consuming an oil refinery every time

3249 2018-03-27 16:48:47 Canada is my home. Better get used of us and also Islam; inshalla, the shariah will soon be the law of the land. #Islamophobia #Islam
3250 2018-03-27 16:48:47 No, I did not say that at all but am passing judgment, I do admit. But who is to say that this snake oil salesman's interpretation of scripture is correct and mine is not? Just commenting based on this charleton's history of divisiveness and hypocrisy.
3251 2018-03-27 16:48:33 Working on guidance/how-to books for teens, you'll be in the middle of editing a paragraph that reminds you to check your oil or make an appointment with a dentist, and you'll do it. Thanks, job, for making me a responsible adult.

3276 2018-03-27 16:45:09 I’m not merely going to jump in and point out that this company is nothing more than a paid shill for oil corporations.

I’m also going to point out that they absolutely suck at their job. What is with these garbage images? Is your company run by snarky teens learning photoshop?
3277 2018-03-27 16:45:07 I was watching this. I was thinking the same thing. I love that she had to oil it!!!
3278 2018-03-27 16:45:03 @Wereknight222 gets it!!
The USD BONDS 4 China /Taiwan (so China) are = 38% of total USD bond debt & an additional 12% owned by South Korea have ALL become available for resale /renegotiate / float etc.. as of this year. China now buys oil in Yuan or Gold! No more US Petro! 1/2

3309 2018-03-27 16:41:01 Just remember that the oil from Washington refineries either comes from Alaska or other places through BC and US waters. The less Alberta oil / fuel you have the more tanker traffic. It is net the same.

3324 2018-03-27 16:39:02 Just mix some sugar with coconut oil 
3325 2018-03-27 16:38:54 And he gets gigantic piles of cash from the Oil Industry
3326 2018-03-27 16:38:53 good job exposing hypocrisy of nefarious obama-Clinton sycophant & the snake oil salesman from NM
3327 2018-03-27 16:38:43 Micheil is a fucking walloper, he just can't understand that the North Sea can't be run any better than it is and the oil is worthless for the foreseeable.
3328 2018-03-27 16:38:32 If baking them, place your chipped potatoes on the baking tray, sprinkle salt and your dried herbs then some (olive) oil. Bake in oven. Until done. If you are cheese person, add some parmesan cheese once removed and while still hot. 
3329 2018-03-27 16:38:30 When he puts sanctions on Putin's favorite Russian oligarchs that control 98% of Russia's money & lowers the price of oil, then you can say he has gotten tough on Russia. this is nothing but BS window dressing.
3330 2018-03-27 16:38:23 What do you do when you have some drumettes but no flour or cooking oil, no BBQ sauce, and u don't want no fucking boiled chicken??? U make you some quesadillas bihhhh

3331 2018-03-27 16:38:21 every time a beauty guru puts oil on their lips i think it’s vape juice
3332 2018-03-27 16:38:20 The deficit for 2017-18 is $812M and includes severance expenses under the new collective agreement. Projected deficit for 2018-19 is $683M. Oil is forecast at US$63 per barrel in both 2018-19 and 2019-20. #nlpoli
3333 2018-03-27 16:38:11 The man changing my oil is ridiculously attractive and REO Speedwagon is playing in the background, someone needs to come rescue me!
3334 2018-03-27 16:38:00 No I didn’t forget, but still didn’t have any real financial plan for Canada he was lucky it wasn’t worse high oil prices saved him
3335 2018-03-27 16:37:56 I wish I could’ve served my country in WW2, the wars today are pointless just bs over boundaries and oil
3336 2018-03-27 16:37:53 He's been saddled with Letestu for most of the season, and Oil have had no shooting threats on the point. It's easy for a PK to limit McDavid when there is nobody else to worry about.
3337 2018-03-27 16:37:44 For those who are not in the knowing, GOR stands for Gas Oil Ratio. Its a mesure of how gassy the production is. High GOR means you need to process more gas to allow for oil production. Gas processing is far much more complex than oil processing.
3338 2018-03-27 16:37:43 This just reminds me I need an oil change.
3339 2018-03-27 16:37:40 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
3340 2018-03-27 16:37:26 @f1autocentres offered to clean my oil soaked driveway. But i have to get 2 quotes. When do I have time to do this?? No mention of reimbursing me the cost of new oil filter, oil, steam clean £175. Crazy. Not over yet.
3341 2018-03-27 16:37:22 อย่าเศร้า
3342 2018-03-27 16:37:19 이번 멘퀘던전 재밌어요 헤딩으로 가도 될듯
3343 2018-03-27 16:37:15 Facebook FUD will continue to harm platform/ad/data cos for a long while on its own. The citron short merely accelerated that for twtr today. Weird how many think this will just blow over short term. Feels like oil bulls early in the reset a few years ago.
3344 2018-03-27 16:37:06 Oil changed  
Opening Day tickets purchased 
3345 2018-03-27 16:37:03 น่าจะรุ่ง
3346 2018-03-27 16:36:59 You apologised fine but you have not told Nigerians what you did with the dollars we earned from oil . So many of your chieftains are in court and all of them said GEJ gave them money for one thing or the order . GEJ should tel us how he shared the money.
3347 2018-03-27 16:36:56 Shame shame oil companies at least think of ur pity dealers who r running outlets alredy in loss
3348 2018-03-27 16:36:32 lol the US could destroy them if they felt like it, theyre just a convenient excuse to camp out in the middle east for oil

3351 2018-03-27 16:36:07 Here's my extremely simple recipe.
Make your fries kama kawaida. Once you have removed them from the oil and they are in a colander, when still extremely hot, sprinkle a teaspoon or less of dried herb (mix of marjoram, Thyme, basil and oregano) and toss with some salt.
3352 2018-03-27 16:36:01 What are your prices for CbD oil
3353 2018-03-27 16:36:01 It's like the Portrait of Dorian Grey, but manifested on their body instead of an oil painting.
3354 2018-03-27 16:35:51 Congress has been and always will be a bunch of wealthy folks on BOTH sides that buy their seat via big oil, NRA, big pharma, or in the pro life pro choice areas. So if u really think there will ever be a unbought seat your a fool!
3355 2018-03-27 16:35:48 Man on elevator yesterday asked me if I was familiar with the downtown area. I said yes, and he asked me where he could buy patchouli oil. Couldn’t help but feel like the first question was a setup. #portland
3356 2018-03-27 16:35:33 I might not have enough oil to fry this chicken but I’m gonna try anyway

3358 2018-03-27 16:35:23 Sejak apply sunscreen frequently everyday and cuci pakai oil cleanser ni i perasan big change to my skin. Smoother, no black head and jarang tumbuh jerawat. Thanks kak @ImanAbdulRahim for writing good stuffs in ur blog
3359 2018-03-27 16:35:22 Mbappe is so composed. Unreal talent..just 19. Gonna be a superstar in the future but has to leave that shit ass oil club in Paris. #mbappe #football
3360 2018-03-27 16:35:22 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
3361 2018-03-27 16:35:22 The good thing about having a boyfriend who went to school to be a mechanic is I won’t have to pay for oil changes anymore
3362 2018-03-27 16:35:17 Who's "they"? Sounds like you're just a follower.

What's silly is your comment and how painfully uninformed you are on oil & how global markets work within the energy sector
3363 2018-03-27 16:34:57 “We are on target to return to surplus, despite the volatility of oil prices.  We are moving forward with a strong commitment to creating conditions for business and employment growth.” #NLbudget2018
3364 2018-03-27 16:34:39 I said flag them, after so many then the cops would respond. I have been ticketed for stealing when i was younger. Not all states work the same, that is the real world, but if that is too hard, change ticket-> charged. Better?
3365 2018-03-27 16:34:08 That South African type that thing Nigerians are better then us or smart think again. Who owns oil in Nigeria???
3366 2018-03-27 16:34:03 who cares, price is all about fund positioning, if all funds sell oil..it goes lower. . recent rise in price is partially attributed to up in demand than production cut. if demand goes down.. higher price is all about common man burden.
3367 2018-03-27 16:33:57 I took my car to get an oil change and the guy was getting my info and looked over at my car and was like “uh... is that a bullet hole..” and things just got awkward from there.. lol
3368 2018-03-27 16:33:57 Hence *if it's fries .... Nyama . When boiling add onions , garlic and ginger. Ikiishaa chemka weka 2 table spoons of oil, stir abit, well tomatoes , dhania and spices and very litu water. Let simmer for two -5 minutes, stir and remove
3369 2018-03-27 16:33:47 Cielo. C i e l o. Si elimimanos la C y E.... OIL
3370 2018-03-27 16:33:36 I was going to drink Castor oil if they wasn’t going to induce me until next week but I just got three more nights of this
3371 2018-03-27 16:33:35 Shows ~2025 as peak oil?
3372 2018-03-27 16:33:27 Extra...Virgin...Oil! (Mitsuboshi Colors) Search it up and watch it, its great. Trust me.
3373 2018-03-27 16:33:23 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3374 2018-03-27 16:33:04 Why is every car named after a female ? I never heard look at JIMMY over there with his new oil change 
3375 2018-03-27 16:32:54 I heard a good remedy for tooth pain is swishing coconut oil 
3376 2018-03-27 16:32:52 Coconut Oil x Lizzo 
3377 2018-03-27 16:32:51 Yoi sama sama bray. Siapin kuota sama tisu aje banyak banyak wkwk. Baby oil dah dikit biar gak keset wkwkwkw
3378 2018-03-27 16:32:44 I’ve been at this oil change shit since 10am on the dot
3379 2018-03-27 16:32:42 Olu, let's not be Naive, the man is richer than the whole Nigeria and he didn't make money from oil well or oil money. Which means he is in a better place to advice us on economics than any economist or chartered accountant we have ever had.
3380 2018-03-27 16:32:38 Great someone looking out for Climate change. I dont think republicans really believe climate change isn't real it just doesn't fit into to kochs brothers or big oil donors greed. Just like their lack of talking points about guns. NRA big money donor.
3381 2018-03-27 16:32:37 Not so sure about that. Rather be in oil
3382 2018-03-27 16:32:30 Saved Kuwait? Saved your natural oil assets and resources. The US only fights wars if they have a significant benefit, not out of the goodness of their hearts. Try again
3383 2018-03-27 16:32:27 I just had a hoagie with oil on it for the first time (in a really really long time technically) and what the fuck have I been doing all my life
3384 2018-03-27 16:32:23 Lemon juice, lime juice, salt, pepper, olive oil.
3385 2018-03-27 16:32:22 The ark myth IS fantasy. It's amazing that it's 2018 and people are still buying snake oil.
3386 2018-03-27 16:32:08 It will create a lot more oil industry activity in the US, which brings lots of well paid jobs @El_Spy @PacificStand @AntoniaJuhasz
3387 2018-03-27 16:32:00 And it is manual.. intraday moves in crude are difficult to automate..so I have to watch it on my 'state of the art very expensive trading terminal with all the gizmos':)
3388 2018-03-27 16:31:48 初めて知ったけどwwww
3389 2018-03-27 16:31:35 do NOT go to Walmart for an oil change they will seriously mess your car up
3390 2018-03-27 16:31:14 The very word "religion" implies "working for your salvation"... Works and Grace are diametrically opposed to one another. Like oil and water they can not be mixed, not even a little bit.. Add one single work to grace and it is no longer grace.
3391 2018-03-27 16:31:11 LOL I just had to message a bunch of girls at work today to see if anyone had non scented lotion at their desk because I was so itchy! And I just used bio oil this morning!
3392 2018-03-27 16:31:09 KS & OK have drained everything. Kids aren't even attending school 5 days a week because they can't keep the lights on, but their pledge to keep cutting taxes for the rich is killing them. In OK the oil industry could keep them afloat, but they won't tax them.
3393 2018-03-27 16:31:09 man i love the essential oil shit that is supposed to adapt to your mood bc that shit don't work

in fact it accurately reflects your personal being, because right now this oil makes me smell like hot steaming garbage
3394 2018-03-27 16:31:01 Cito literalmente:"Japan is the world's second largest importer of foreign oil.Japan uses about 4.5 million barrels of oil a day, and 99.7 percent of Japan's oil is imported".Se lo traduzco?Japón importa el 99.7 del petróleo que consume. Eso significa que es importador neto!
3395 2018-03-27 16:31:00 Why just say Alberta's boreal forest? BC's is doing great?... I smell a "we better stop the oil production to protect the forest" scandal coming from the unqualified environment minister via the puppet master Gerry Butts.
3396 2018-03-27 16:30:49 Tavito lee el documento antes de mandarlo....el aguacate nunca paga mas al fisco q el oil, en el doc q mandas hablan de la balanza comercial positiva del aguacate en mex, contra la balanza negativa del oil, pero como ingresos lejos el oil supera al aguacate....
3397 2018-03-27 16:30:46 Your analogy makes zero sense, oil is a resource not a gadget. You are aware that global demand for oil/gas is increasing daily? Is your foolish plan to simply turn off the tap & let populations "figure it out"? With thinking like that it's no surprise you're not taken seriously
3398 2018-03-27 16:30:45 Because the police have nothing better to do then to answer every call about a "crazy" person, and there's endless capacity to hold and evaluate every such person.

Tickets for stealing? You don't live in the real world, but you do have the most accurate screen name on Twitter.

3400 2018-03-27 16:30:34 Buy my used car, I unhooked the odometer for 4 years, that oil slick on the drive way is from multiple dropped coca-cola's.  That silver lining you see on the left front is actually a silver lining.  Those new seat covers were 39.99 at Big Lots, don't look under them. Buy my car.

3402 2018-03-27 16:30:22 So much for Trudeau's one size fits all climate plan. The provinces, NB and NS will be taxed even though they meet 2020 emissions targets. Alberta is getting a pass to increase oil and gas emissions while the rest of Canada is held to a higher standard.
3403 2018-03-27 16:30:18 Our currency is still volatile no thanks to the oil price. Companies like Apple have their own buffer set by them in order for them not to lose a lot of money in case the currency drops like fly.
3404 2018-03-27 16:30:06 What is your solution? Keep jobs, find a way to get oil to market, protect the environment. Balance the 3. What is your viable solution without alienating one part of the population.
3405 2018-03-27 16:29:48 Ótima notícia para indústria de energias renováveis inclusive. Barril Oil abaixo de US$40, provocaria destruição da indústria mundial de energia.
3406 2018-03-27 16:29:44 On the list of things that don't go together, where do you have donuts and marathons?? Just below oil and water.
3407 2018-03-27 16:29:24  URGENT REQUIREMENT FOR LEADING ABU DHABI OIL
3408 2018-03-27 16:29:19 The next time it came, I phoned up the number given, but turned out that was the supervisor (or whatever). Eventually managed to make an order. (Skin So-Soft dry oil, as it is supposed to repel mosquitoes, and a perfume)
3409 2018-03-27 16:29:13 Given the even split between stacked books, candles, half-written letters, fascinators, aromatherapy oil, and hand creams plural, apparently I open a pop-up spa to earn my fare home.

One with two tiny Corellian corvettes watching the front desk. >.>
3410 2018-03-27 16:28:55 If you think so, more power to you. All you have done is say it won't work with no proof that it would not.
3411 2018-03-27 16:28:49 Russia has oil AND weapons of mass destruction. 
3412 2018-03-27 16:28:48 I just spent $200 on oil & NOW she thinks I’m about to spend $45 on an oil change. Yea she really got me fucked up
3413 2018-03-27 16:28:41 น้ำหนักขึ้นไม่หยุดเลย 
3414 2018-03-27 16:28:32 Great job! You guys should add those who receive money from big Pharma, banks, big oil, tobacco, sugar industry... there's a lot of work to do
3415 2018-03-27 16:28:26 Found another use for coconut oil. Place a jar outside your window.
Solid = pants weather
Liquid = shorts weather
3416 2018-03-27 16:28:22 The SRB WaterBalm is truly what helped my oily skin because it’s so hydrating my skin doesn’t need to produce as much oil. I also LOVE the Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream, which I use at night a few times a week. It’s a great intense moisturizer that isn’t TOO heavy.
3417 2018-03-27 16:28:16 Every "policy" floating around in Conservative Alberta involves pointing at Québec squirrels. Oil prices are low. There is a supply glut. Bitumen is least desirable in the scheme of things. Shale is sucking up all the capex. Group-think makes people dumb.
3418 2018-03-27 16:28:01 “Native Salad” is a mix of chopped veggies like cabbage, carrots, peppers, sometimes chopped apples. Then they add whale meat, fish eggs and maybe other exotic wild food. It’s topped with whale or seal oil. People LOVE IT! #YupikGourmand #NativeSalad
3419 2018-03-27 16:28:00 Exclusive: OPEC, Russia consider 10-20 year oil alliance - Saudi Crown Prince: NEW YORK (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia are working on a long-term deal to cooperate on oil supply curbs that could extend controls over world oil supplies by major exporters for many years to come.

3422 2018-03-27 16:27:56 I really need to shake this damn cold off ... apparently oregano oil is the answer... had anyone tried it before?
3423 2018-03-27 16:27:56 Send the cops, if they think the person is crazy, hold em, let them get checked out.

Yes tickets are more data showing law breaking behavior (traffic/stealing,ect).
3424 2018-03-27 16:27:55 lol I thought my lease had a service plan and it doesn't, I just paid $95 for an oil change 
3425 2018-03-27 16:27:42 Liberals can’t understand how you can trust a snake oil salesmen again and again and again. Just because he says he has your values doesn’t make it true. Just ask his three wives he’s cheated on.
3426 2018-03-27 16:27:36 No there is no Big White Down on the daily yet.. I was telling him of the intraday chart.. FE is at 70.
3427 2018-03-27 16:27:29 Just like Marthanda Varma plundered the nearby provinces of Travancore, we now see data being stolen (but with your permission) by various platforms we love to use everyday. 

#data is the new gold, the new oil.
3428 2018-03-27 16:27:25 I have about 4L of cooking oil in the house. Kununua ingine ni karûgano sasa.
3429 2018-03-27 16:27:15 ANYONE notice GAS PRICES NOT GOING DOWN even though US has enough oil to sell to the world!  OUR GOV should clamp down on the oil companies who seem never satisfied & only controlled by their GREED!
3430 2018-03-27 16:27:12 Socialism can’t even work on a sea of oil and America’s Liberals embrace it like the second coming of Jesus Christ, or whomever.....I mean they are Democrats......
3431 2018-03-27 16:27:11 These supposed facts actually contradict much lower job numbers from Kinder Morgan to NEB!! And tge revenues are based on long gone $100+ per barrel oil!!!!
3432 2018-03-27 16:26:58 You should only use real olive oil, for everything!
3433 2018-03-27 16:26:50 Assert a claim I never made, then say I'm going around in circles.

By the way something, I see the lame trap you're trying to set there.

You haven't offered a single viable real world solution.
3434 2018-03-27 16:26:48 @JoseAMeadeK equivocó la profesión, con sus habilidades sería buen guía de turistas o traductor de la ONU o monito chino "pala vel, oil y callal" la estafa maestra y otras o relator de fábulas por decir que mandó a la carcel a los corruptos del PRIAN que gozan de cabal impunidad
3435 2018-03-27 16:26:46 A plan when the spill happens. We don’t need a BP oil spill like in the Gulf where they were not prepared!

3437 2018-03-27 16:26:24 Coconut oil saved my life
3438 2018-03-27 16:26:23 Lavender essential oil and my diffuser is the only thing getting me more than 3 hours of sleep each night. Can’t recommend enough!
3439 2018-03-27 16:26:08 Just veggie oil! But ohhhh goose fat 
3440 2018-03-27 16:26:02 يستاهلوو 
3441 2018-03-27 16:25:57 I am thinking about going to the Oil @ Canucks on Thursday night, if I can get some decent seats at a good price.
3442 2018-03-27 16:25:46 I can't cook at all, but one thing I can cook is fish in parchment paper! I use garlic, anchovy paste, capers, and red pepper flakes in my recipe (plus butter and olive oil). It's fool-proof and yummy! And easy to clean up, you just throw away the paper!
3443 2018-03-27 16:25:20 Ayyyyyy yup since the top of 2018. But I do have to say, lavender essential oil (get a diffuser and use that shit!!) and b&b works stress relief lotion has helped tenfold. Also I take melatonin on the weekends to help me at least get good sleep then
3444 2018-03-27 16:25:07 Hi Daisy. Thanks for raising such an important question. Companies who are members of the RSPO use certified sustainable palm oil, grown according to Principles + Criteria. These criteria protect primary forest 1/2
3445 2018-03-27 16:24:52 Now that China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, the country is seeking to end the standardization of oil trade in dollars, moving instead to the yuan. Make no mistake; this could mean death for the Petrodollar
3446 2018-03-27 16:24:44 It's lost to the either now but I'm remembering this time when lee fang was criticizing some lefty protesters for de-platforming and someone asked him what they should do instead and he responded with "round the clock protests at oil companies" lol
3447 2018-03-27 16:24:41 Such a huge issue.  Also, RA can be addressed by vegan, plant based diet (no oil, meat or dairy)
3448 2018-03-27 16:24:38 Coconut oil ruined my slin
3449 2018-03-27 16:24:19 Ok I’ll throw you some more bones: The difficult thing to get is that his economics were based on direct distribution, not wealth creation, so the stats for poverty mean people had more cash to spend, not better jobs etc... poverty before him 46%, during oil boom 27%, today 72%.
3450 2018-03-27 16:24:13 You know the steel and aluminum industry depend on OIL, yet you continue to buy from other despicable countries with their human rights violations and continue to knock down the  ALBERTA OIL Industry......
3451 2018-03-27 16:24:13 Yes but they are not taking responsibility, the economic situation was long overdue - oil prices have a key role in it plus the Daronomics.

3454 2018-03-27 16:23:58 I do a good job of eating healthy food during the week but on the weekend I eat a dozen donuts, 3 bacon cheeseburgers and inject vegetable oil into my veins.
3455 2018-03-27 16:23:56 Why do the very same people going insane that Trudeau allowed light armored tanks to be sold to Saudi Arabia never say a word about Canada buying the very same Saudi Oil that pays the bills for those tanks? Help me out here.
3456 2018-03-27 16:23:53 Oil price on the up again recently - perhaps waiting for it to hit the $113 level. Only another 70ish% to go.....
3457 2018-03-27 16:23:50 She’s not a hooker, but you’re worse than a snake oil salesman...
3458 2018-03-27 16:23:49 Now you are going in circles. You claim the mentally ill shouldn't have guns, but we shouldn't check if they are crazy. basically you want no solution.

3461 2018-03-27 16:23:38 "Your boss can call the cops and say you are crazy."

And if you're not?

And you do believe traffic tickets are an important consideration in the battle against gun crime?
3462 2018-03-27 16:23:33 Michigan must protect its GreatLakes Water Quality & ban chemicals, oil drilling & any dumping in it.    We must save water by using composting method potty's & not waste it on flushing, as it is needed to drink...don't you agree?
3463 2018-03-27 16:23:27 There is considerable evidence to support this, and that it is their primary approach (oil companies always have multiple strategies).
3464 2018-03-27 16:23:17 Enough sleeping and enough overthinking. Imma burning the “morning” oil.
3465 2018-03-27 16:23:01 We get asked a lot about the advantages of our Synthetic Blend Oil. Read more about why this oil is a better option.
3466 2018-03-27 16:22:52 Pls make a video stating that the Central Oil and Gas Ministry has nothing to do with this! Entirely done by AAP government, doesn’t matter if they were not even aware of it!
3467 2018-03-27 16:22:43 Que diga si apoya o no apoya el shale oil asi se saca la carteta
3468 2018-03-27 16:22:16 Name a civil right that would be infringed upon. Your boss can call the cops and say you are crazy. The police know you have been ticketed, or charged with a crime.

Can you add anything to the conversation?
3469 2018-03-27 16:22:14 Axe oil usually helps - but you know better Doc!
3470 2018-03-27 16:22:11 Big White down is here? We had two little light blues. FE turned?

3473 2018-03-27 16:22:02 I will wait another month or two to see how oil traders played the game between North America, West Africa, and Latin America 
3474 2018-03-27 16:21:57 Here are a list of reasonable criticisms of Chavez: corruption, over-dependence on an oil based economy, not addressing some infrastructure needs (esp., the roadways and national highways, over-reaching Pan-Latin American development programs, and not adopting fully socialism
3475 2018-03-27 16:21:55 I don't like being in a class full of oil painters, it makes me feel incompetent and weird

3479 2018-03-27 16:21:36 does ur man rub oil on ur bum the way hers does for a photo shoot? NOPE
3480 2018-03-27 16:21:35 Roman Abramovich was literally an orphan by the age of 4, living neer the fucking arctic circle, without finishing highschool, sold rubber ducks in Moscow market and by the time he was 30 ran the largest oil co in Russia. Overcome those odds and do that Techbros.
3481 2018-03-27 16:21:30 Wish I could grow my eyebrows wit castor + coconut oil without my skin saying fuckkkk you 
3482 2018-03-27 16:21:13 RT @MysticMomentsUK NEW COMPETITION - This week you can win our Elements Essential Oil Gift Pack - a lovely pack of essential oil blends.  Just follow us and retweet any of our posts.  Winner drawn at random next Friday at this time.  Good luck
3483 2018-03-27 16:21:07 Hostile? You're delusional. I've been quite nice so far to your ridiculous ideas.
3484 2018-03-27 16:21:03 Yeah! I have the canson oil and acrylic pad ! I like how stiff it is and the grain holds up with just about any medium
3485 2018-03-27 16:20:59 As I understand you'll have to take down your videos featuring bump stocks, full auto fire, and oil can suppressor vids.
3486 2018-03-27 16:20:55 "LESS THAN ZERO
... five of the 11 companies will actually receive federal income tax refunds this year. American taxpayers will send California's Chevron a check for $382 million, as well as checks to Apache for $38M, Marathon Oil for $32M, Hess for $23M, Pioneer $5M"
3487 2018-03-27 16:20:43 Coconut oil based toothpaste does the trick. Make your own.
3488 2018-03-27 16:20:35 Good grief, how awful for you both.  

I've told my  stepdad to start researching CBD oil with a view to her trying it. If anything it should make her more comfortable
3489 2018-03-27 16:20:33 So I've been watching some American cooking videos lately (fuck knows why. I'm never gonna cook that crap.)
But it occurred to me... Why is their Olive Oil *luminous* green?
I know my Olive Oil. And it ain't green.
3490 2018-03-27 16:20:30 Use beard oil to shave with rather than a foam. Best of all though dont shave. Real men have beards dude.
3491 2018-03-27 16:20:22 Requirement to attend a mental health screening for owning a gun is violation of civil liberty, especially as you could lose your rights if you don't "just answer questions", or don't give the "right" answers.
3492 2018-03-27 16:20:06 It is the crevasse of economic oblivion. No trade (with anybody around the world as all trade agreements end), no planes flying, no food moving in or out of the country, and the pound in meltdown. It'll  feel like Venezuela without the oil. Brexezuela.
3493 2018-03-27 16:19:58 1 way to easily slow down global warming is to stop burning oil. If you were to stop burning oil and start using an electric heater to heat your home, we could help keep many toxic emissions out of the air and atmosphere
#stopglobalwarming #ClimateChangeIsReal
3494 2018-03-27 16:19:43 The oil is the only thing that these countries are interested in. And Israel too. They are all in it together.
3495 2018-03-27 16:19:32 Thanks for looking out for the RSPO logo on products Nicola. Simply by choosing products that use certified sustainable palm oil, we can all play a role in helping to protect valuable forest and wildlife.
3496 2018-03-27 16:19:30 I know it works. People were smoking everywhere and the police had no clue what to do. You do not see that anymore. The fact that you are becoming hostile tells me that you have nothing more to contribute.
3497 2018-03-27 16:19:19 Must have been a fng doing the oil change.
3498 2018-03-27 16:19:00 Omg make sure it’s Jamaican castor oil!!! That’s the shit that really works my friend had to trim her lashes because it made them so long
3499 2018-03-27 16:18:47 Iraq wasn't meant to be a distraction... It was a power grab over Oil... The consequences of which will reverberate for decades...
3500 2018-03-27 16:18:29  His oil slick drawl enough to fry...anything that takes a long time to fry...
3501 2018-03-27 16:18:25 Argan oil
3502 2018-03-27 16:18:23 It is a intraday manual indicator  ,,I based it off Big White..to give me a idea where leveraged money is about to move.up or down in crude oil
3503 2018-03-27 16:18:17 Coconut oil is a must
3504 2018-03-27 16:18:15 As the pressure mounts on fossil fuels with few alternatives emerging with large scale feasibility, we could see a draining of bog land to claim what precious combustible turf remains to supply the ever increasing demand that natural gas and oil fail to meet.
3505 2018-03-27 16:18:13 Your proposals are absurdly unwieldy, prohibitively expensive, unlikely to implemented consistently, and infringe on the civil rights of gun owners.

Tickets? Traffic tickets should be a determinant in gun ownership?

3509 2018-03-27 16:18:02 Norway found oil in the 60s. An Iranian helped write the legislation to secure the income for the state. Nigeria had a dictator out for personal wealth...
3510 2018-03-27 16:17:54 Maybe we can just make "oil and gas production" a required class in public schools. Maybe then some people would see the intertwined goals in education.
3511 2018-03-27 16:17:49 Drink water, lather yourself in coconut oil and take care of hair and skin. Get your nails done. Read books. Start a business. Mind your business.
3512 2018-03-27 16:17:48 I spilled a little of the oily stuff that my tuna chunks were in on my pillow and now it'll forever have a spot that smells like tuna in oil
3513 2018-03-27 16:17:44 lol, stop being hysterical. Name one civil liberty that would surrendered. Having to see a shrink, and answer questions is not going to kill you.
3514 2018-03-27 16:17:39 At first glance this is great. But how will the electricity for these charging points be generated? Solar? Or burning of oil or unsustainable resources to produce the electricity? Could fossil fuel burning increase to meet the electricity needs of the cars?
3515 2018-03-27 16:17:27 @contntfreelance Sorry to hear that. Did you get the oil changed yet?
3516 2018-03-27 16:17:03 I am all over that
3517 2018-03-27 16:17:01 @TODAYshow where can we purchase olive oil that was mentioned in your super foods segment today? Atsas?

3522 2018-03-27 16:16:25 100$ for an oil change lmao these mechanics charging females out the ass
3523 2018-03-27 16:16:20 :( yep. Snake oil

3528 2018-03-27 16:15:52 Not the biggest fan of salad, but serve it with chips and coat it in old fryer oil?!
3529 2018-03-27 16:15:47 It seems like when they’re not caked in makeup and dripping oil from their bodies in a photo shoot nobody likes them. The model dark skin women get all the love but I feel sorry for the young dark skin girls who constantly are rejected b/c these little boys are ignorant
3530 2018-03-27 16:15:44 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,I will fear no evil: for Thou Art with me;Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:Thou anointest my head with oil;my cup runneth over.-Ps 23:4-5  Amen KJV
3531 2018-03-27 16:15:41 You really believe people can be made to do something just by changing "procedures".

The comparison to pot legalization is facile and demonstrates you have little grasp of the scale of the problem.
3532 2018-03-27 16:15:35 Oh dat sounds like you Habs fun Sammy! Does you got olive oil Smoochies? Heehee!
3533 2018-03-27 16:15:28 I just get real argan oil from oman. *hairlifts*

3535 2018-03-27 16:15:08 @DrGundry just realized that MCT oil pairs well with Scharffen Berger unsweetened natural cocoa powder.  The possibilities seem endless.  Okay to heat the pairing?
3536 2018-03-27 16:15:06 I want the background check system to be keeping up tabs on everyone with a gun. Not stalking mind you, but every ticket, trouble at work/school. After so many flags send the cops out to check.
3537 2018-03-27 16:14:55 But it doesn't actually tell how to make coconut oil coffee does it ? I hate these type of tweets and tweeters.
3538 2018-03-27 16:14:50 ...but, back to this great idea of cutting off the flow of your oil to the USA! How is that going to work for you? People who live here, take transit paid for out of their own pocket to stand up to say NO to this. Your fantasy of foreign funding does not apply! #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3539 2018-03-27 16:14:33 It’s good in a skillet if it’s nonstick!! Cause if it sticks, it falls apart lol just put some coconut oil on that bih:)
3540 2018-03-27 16:14:16 Sometimes it is not the conventional way, GOD will use to give you  victory. Look to GOD with whatever you have in your hands first, you  will be amazed at how many containers a little oil can fill with GODly  instructions!
3541 2018-03-27 16:13:55 Oil sands! It must have been a tailings pond! Someone call Leo!
3542 2018-03-27 16:13:54 appointment done , brakes done , oil change done , swimsuits coming today and I gotta work ..: it’s safe to say today was productive and it’s not even over

3544 2018-03-27 16:13:40 I so look forward to the large tub of mayonnaise I bought! Also ordered a tube of Japanese mayo so I can be so sick of mayonnaise afterwards. Greek yogurt, brie, butter, ghee & coconut oil are on their way too. Let’s get fat!
3545 2018-03-27 16:13:38 Woke up late when I wanted to get up at 8 and so now I’m sitting at the car place getting an oil change which is gonna take forever and I’m already bored as f
3546 2018-03-27 16:13:35 To get my oil changed or to buy these comic con tickets? Hmmm
3547 2018-03-27 16:13:33 @jimcramer Hey Jim-Why do you think oil stocks & funds still lagging while oil prices rising over last 6-12 months? Losing my patience with energy sector. Sell? Hold? 
Thx, Fly Eagles Fly!
3548 2018-03-27 16:13:20 Have you tried using the @Smashbox primer oil? My skin is riddled with dry patches sometimes and this product helps a lottttt like the foundation lays a lot smoother on my skin
3549 2018-03-27 16:13:15 Not oil
3550 2018-03-27 16:13:10 I’m getting my oil changed and they’ve offered me Starbucks and chips....
3551 2018-03-27 16:13:02 the dentist really has the audacity to tell me I can't moisturize before my surgery...how am I supposed to keep up my skin care routine does he know the importance of ROSEHIP OIL
3552 2018-03-27 16:12:59 Lmfao the private Russian clickfarm who spent $100,000 in ads (NOT Russian government btw) pales in comparison to the tens of millions @HillaryClinton got donated to her by Middle Eastern Gulf oil states... who throw gays off buildings... for being gay... #RealProgressive
3553 2018-03-27 16:12:52 Canada's plan consists mostly of tweeted pictures of @cathmckenna spouting lies. Canada lied to the world when @JustinTrudeau signed the Paris Agreement. The Liberals think increasing oil sands production is much more important than fighting climate change.
3554 2018-03-27 16:12:36 When the recommendation of every urban visionary worthy of the title is rejected in the name of "pro transit" then you know you are about to be sold a bottle of snake oil.
3555 2018-03-27 16:12:29 Meaning to own a gun you must surrender your civil liberties. Again, a very odd definition of "common sense".
3556 2018-03-27 16:12:25 Also oil is one of the single most detrimental forms of energy, look at @Shell in the niger delta
3557 2018-03-27 16:12:25 I wonder if it’s the witch hazel, coconut oil/shea butter or this clay & charcoal mask
3558 2018-03-27 16:12:24 Ah. Well, a snake oil salesman can never be trusted in the first place.
3559 2018-03-27 16:12:17 Yeah, changing procedure isn't that hard. Had a lot of issues when CO passed pot, took a few years with a lot of problems, but now things working great.
3560 2018-03-27 16:12:15 @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @CBCMorningLive  I just heard about your FAILURE on environmental issues!
It proves what I have been saying, you have your heads up Oil Company’s asses!
What are you going to do now?

3573 2018-03-27 16:11:12 Can someone please buy the boy Beard Oil from @_BrothersBeard 

Please
3574 2018-03-27 16:11:05 Get your refineries ready to turn heating oil into diesel buddy. I mean it is what it is. At $60 WTI, these barrels will be produced and the market will have to swallow them one way or another, whether you like or not
3575 2018-03-27 16:11:01 Please tell Bill that the @potus is quietly hitting Russia where it hurts while the US overtakes Russia’s oil industry. It’s hurting Russia very bad in the pocket book!
3576 2018-03-27 16:10:53 I am, unless the price of oil goes down. Then I don’t win so much and it sucks. But I’ve only had 1 “bad” year since 04 so I’ll take it. I avg about 200 days of work a year. 

It doesn’t pay what it used to but I can’t do 8-5 M-F. I want to hurt ppl
3577 2018-03-27 16:10:52 yo is it just me or are these america oil memes really fucking lame
3578 2018-03-27 16:10:30 If anything I had a few guys request to see my natural hair more. It was a cute suggestion. However, if you aren’t helping me during wash day or oil my dry scalp then  NO!
3579 2018-03-27 16:10:28 What is surprising is that even well read people feign ignorance now. Did they not know what these trillion dollar valuations are based on.  Data is the new oil.  @NirmallyaKar
3580 2018-03-27 16:10:26 So you would rather import oil from the middle east where women are treated like dogs and where there are very few environmental regulations? Better to export from here, where we try so very hard to do what we do, as safely and environmentally conscious as we can.

3583 2018-03-27 16:10:19 Yea even NeSmith seals don’t have to add weight in Fastrak IF the oil pressure specs are within range. However, with latest rule changes, all series are equal meaning no weight variances amongst them. Especially when old motors lap out.
3584 2018-03-27 16:10:07 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
3585 2018-03-27 16:09:55 Usually coolant in the oil, since coolant will get into the cylinders and can bypass the rings.
We have both. 
Now that i think about it a bit more...
Imma stick a gauge on the cooler...
3586 2018-03-27 16:09:43 Kobesy, Do you also think $XOP/$DRIP a good short along with $DWT? Or does $DRIP follow more of the indices than $OIL?

3590 2018-03-27 16:09:31 Steve, since Liberals have sanctuary cities for illegals, there will be sanctuary states for guns.  Not gonna happen. Oh, and those states produce your food, drill your oil and control the cross country transportation networks.   The cities will starve.  might want a gun then.
3591 2018-03-27 16:09:26 It takes a while for all those LNG plants to get built;  for U.S. autos to start rolling into S. Korea;  for our oil exports to reach expected levels;  for our Steel and Aluminum furnaces to ramp up.....Although imports will continue apace, our EXPORTS will take gigantic leaps.
3592 2018-03-27 16:09:23 But still no oil, butter or salt and pepper. Please adjust priorities.
3593 2018-03-27 16:09:16 Thats not right!! HALF NORTHERN ONTARIO AND MARITIMERS MOAN ABOUT GOIN..fuckn hell they miss Water and Ocean..Alberta tourism ,cow , bible belt and big oil..minitexas with half gun pipe!

3595 2018-03-27 16:08:53 Why is gun more likely to be wrested away from a woman? Is this research based on/influenced by the discredited idea that there are fundamental biological differences between men and women?
3596 2018-03-27 16:08:41 Not a CCS guy, but can offer a few random thoughts: 
1. There is little reason to build CCS without some specific carbon price/restriction. Otherwise, it is just a FF plant that is expensive to build and run (though you might be able to sell the CO2 to an oil company for EOR).
3597 2018-03-27 16:08:33 I will! The cbd oil has definitely made me feel less like crying all the time but I dunno if that's placebo just yet
3598 2018-03-27 16:08:19 No people go postal due to environmental stress. To just let people buy guns then never check on them again is foolish. People with guns should be regulated.
3599 2018-03-27 16:08:19 This is an “expert opinion” that’s been bought!
Just like those scientists that have been debunking Climate Change bought n paid for by Oil industry!

3618 2018-03-27 16:05:38 But they often don't (and this is also something fraught with abuses). So now what? Magically 'make' them do it?

tbh I always wear shimmering oil 
3626 2018-03-27 16:04:42 Not sure yet. It could still be the oil cooler, though unlikely since she's getting combustion pressure in the cooling system.
Injector cups or firerings likely.
3627 2018-03-27 16:04:30 the bible says take care of the earth, but the "world's gonna end soon anyway" line makes it easier, even holier, to support oil companies
3628 2018-03-27 16:04:25 So simply owning a gun should be considered a mental health problem? And you believe this to be common sense?
3629 2018-03-27 16:04:12 There is no comparison between bitcoin and oil.
3630 2018-03-27 16:03:59 Just got my accounting professor to cancel class on Thursday for fish oil pills....
3631 2018-03-27 16:03:52 It actually does make sense if you fill in the spelling and grammatical errors. He essentially said there was no fans before Arab or Oil money at City.
3632 2018-03-27 16:03:38 More of the same that already doesn't work.

Background checks do nothing if the person has nothing criminal in their background, and "flagging" people can easily be abused.
3633 2018-03-27 16:03:30 Argh. Like throwing oil on a fire. 

The vast majority of gun control advocates don’t want the Amendment repealed. 

Please don’t feed the NRA trolls.
3634 2018-03-27 16:03:29 Well actually the Oil industry is pushing clean coal and natural gas as solutions to global warming. They are pushing fueled sources of power. Fueled sources of power will always be much better than unfueled sources like wind and solar. So wind&solar are not competitors.
3635 2018-03-27 16:03:06 I can’t believe I left oil cleanser and purple shampoo at home but at least I remembered a sheet mask!!!!! :)
3636 2018-03-27 16:02:54 Sure thing bud but I don't feel that way. I feel much safer knowing that I have guns I'm proficient in using for defense an hunting. Just because you don't think you can handle your shit shouldn't effect me

3647 2018-03-27 16:01:53 Guns are tools of murder, and should be well regulated. I think people with guns should be seeing a shrink every month, but would settle for yearly.
3648 2018-03-27 16:01:07 The world still needs our oil. You cannot turn the taps off overnight. The pipelines are necessary.
3649 2018-03-27 16:01:07 Which I have discussed in detail in my blog, but in the process we need oil to run our society and need to move it in the safest manner possible
3650 2018-03-27 16:01:06 It's sorted now. A canvas is a little like our skin and sometimes needs moisturising, in this case, with oil!

3653 2018-03-27 16:00:35 Great point @GAR_Sinarmas - the more consumers are aware of sustainable palm oil products and choose to support such products, the faster we can transform the industry.
3654 2018-03-27 16:00:33 Nice try, girl in the cowboy hat has parents who probably won’t beat or burn her with hot oil for disagreeing with who they arranged for her to marry.

3656 2018-03-27 16:00:17 that is a lot to explain. 

Background check for every gun sale period. Included in the system would be some way for schools, police, fbi and business to flag people that have gone crazy in the mean time, so they can be dealt with immediately.

3663 2018-03-27 15:59:55 People always slam 20W-50 in, say, Chrysler 440s. Fine, but far thicker fluid than when they were new. Always strikes me as odd. Oiled through the rockers, too, so thick oil just slows lubrication to the top end. Any modern oil's far better, too...

The lady huffed and called him a waste of time and stormed off. 

But to Vegeta’s shock and dismay, some of the other moms thought he was a hero for getting rid of the pushy MLM oil rep. 

Now he’s invited to 3 kids’ bday parties.

3687 2018-03-27 15:56:26 Yeah guns aren't for intimidation when you pull out your cc pistol it is to shoot someone when you're in fear of your life. Kinda hard wrestling with someone when you're being shot

3733 2018-03-27 15:50:41 @Audi @AudiOfficial VERY FRUSTRATED, I dropped off my 2017 A4 for an oil change on 2/24, I was told it needed to get a water pump replaced. It’s been over a month and there is still no fixed date in sight, just a lot of run around. I’m very dissatisfied.
3734 2018-03-27 15:50:41 So if "you people" care about Democracy you won't mind us putting our case on liars cheats & charlatans peddling brexit snake oil

3745 2018-03-27 15:49:46 When deepfrying food I feel you shouldn’t just walk away from the frying pan full of oil and frying food. But that’s just me 
3746 2018-03-27 15:49:43 read something today, if you need a boost in your dopamine upon waking. Then try fish oil before bed? its not cheese if you want to fast :) that will bump your dopamine a little?
3747 2018-03-27 15:49:42 Lmao Palm oil too and fruits
3748 2018-03-27 15:49:30 Lost the argument? You can’t change the laws of physics. 

Shell is pushing hydrogen because at scale the hydrogen would come from steam reformed natural gas. They want to replace oil sales with natural gas.

3767 2018-03-27 15:47:28 Health care went down the tubes, govt services and benefits slashed, and in the meantime the Tory’s feathered their nests and those of their cronies with mega $ contracts. The economy boomed because oil was well over $100/barrel, while the Tories were busy going on fishing trips.

3770 2018-03-27 15:47:02 And you are correct I agree it's not fair and we need fairness. It really upsets me when someone gets away with murder because of who they are or oil like or know. I'll join your effort anytime. All the best to you.

3773 2018-03-27 15:46:56 Being “Alberta Bound” and deeply loving your province does not equate Jason Kenney or a Conservative party that got Alberta deeply in trouble by not preparing for a world not dependent on oil. Conservatives has been a disaster there.

3779 2018-03-27 15:46:30 yes, the problem is that IMO most restaurants cut corners and use things that I wouldn't use.  They are supposed to list ingredients but I think they secretly use cheap oils and not real olive oil.  Plus there's the cost of it$$$ I can make meals for a week on one meal eating out

3784 2018-03-27 15:46:00 California needs to take notice of this. The increase here in oil drilling & fracking will end up looking like this.
3785 2018-03-27 15:45:54 Yeah well oil spills weren't illegal in 1850. So legality doesn't hold a lot of water, especially not as an excuse for clear impact.

3792 2018-03-27 15:44:57 Alberta is leading the country in job and economic growth. The downturn was due to an oil glut courtesy of OPEC, forcing Alberta-based energy CO’s to lay off by the thousands. What exactly did the govt do to encourage that? You are the one who is blind cuz u obviously don’t read.
3793 2018-03-27 15:44:47 Energy industry is here today for #rally4therigs.

Last night’s vote is a coincidence

3795 2018-03-27 15:43:59 Olive oil is the best moisturizer no doubt
3796 2018-03-27 15:43:51 Always tell both sides Andrew. Decline in the oil patch and uncertainty in NAFTA. so unless you have control over the world oil market and have control over trump then you have nothing to offer. You are consistently proving why people should not vote for you.

3806 2018-03-27 15:43:17 The success of the show is that it portrays working-class people rather than doctors/lawyers/oil tycoons/etc. The kind of people @SalenaZito listens to before writing, unlike most of her colleagues, who suffer from the Pauline Kael Effect.

It was very nice, FYI! He went to Trunks’ soccer game and trolled some suburban mom that tried to rope him into her essential oil pyramid scheme.
3810 2018-03-27 15:43:11 I would guess that this type of litigation would ultimately be fruitless (climate change and oil co.'s is a different matter), but assuming that gun manufacturers cant be liable unless the gun itself malfunctions is probably wrong 3/x

3833 2018-03-27 15:41:13 Anyone advocating for far far higher energy costs is essentially advocating for huge human death toll, due to mass starvation as higher energy costs implies far far higher food costs. As such one could argue it is a campaign for population reduction, in disguise. Food = oil use!

Magazine cap limits achieve nothing at all. Any remotely smart shooter would just carry more mags.

3864 2018-03-27 15:37:39 Terrific, succinct commentary. Congrats! 

Important for Albertans to understand spending choices matter -fiscal outcomes not shaped jut by oil prices.

Gov inherited fiscal challenges, as you note- but has been complacent in the face of them and therefore exacerbated them.
3865 2018-03-27 15:37:36 And another $1M from a Russian oil baron. How does that make these young people arrogant?
3866 2018-03-27 15:37:27 Nahhhh. If you spread it evenly it looks good. I think using some type of oil is better than just dusting highlighter all over. Gives that glow from within
3867 2018-03-27 15:37:15 Your rash looks like gutate psoriasis x try using dovabet and pure coconut oil wraps. They really help x wish you all the best x
3868 2018-03-27 15:36:56 Agreed. Chrome oil will still reign supreme. Google has built a whole edu eco system.
3869 2018-03-27 15:36:46 You say a lot of smart things my friend. You make Twitter worth more than it was (I got mine for free; they threw it in with an oil change). I appreciate you.
3870 2018-03-27 15:36:44 I like the "No Maintenance" aspect of having an EV... No more oil changes, air filters, transmission oil changes... No more engine/transmission repairs after warranty... etc etc etc... Yes, I'll buy a Pure EV in 2 years.
3871 2018-03-27 15:36:43 Funny you should say that. I fancied a banana sundae, but had no bananas just veg oil. Now I am sick.

3874 2018-03-27 15:36:27 Hah! Never know man. I mean we can see the difference in our dog's coat after giving him some coconut oil occasionally, so I bet it's possible.

.........aaaand now I want Asian takeout. 
3875 2018-03-27 15:36:18 @nytimes Nice to see you got your check from the Big Food/Agra lobby. Nice plugs on vegetable oil today -- two articles! Jane Brody needs to be educated or retired. You choose. @bigfatsurprise @ProfTimNoakes @markhymanmd
3876 2018-03-27 15:36:12 I'm going to start my clove oil process tonight if anyone is interested in buying some! It works great for skin care, mouth aches, muscle aches, basically everything.
3877 2018-03-27 15:36:09 Gavin had explanation already for that: finance (fake profits pre crisis written off afterwards) and oil
3878 2018-03-27 15:36:08 Trying out a hot oil deep condition, going to try growing my hair out to 30in

3880 2018-03-27 15:36:03 ANG GANDA NG CASTOR OIL PUTEKKKKKKKK
3881 2018-03-27 15:36:03 Laos na yung "sorry, napuwing lang ako." pag umiiyak kayo, eto try niyo:
- nalagyan lang ng castor oil ung mata ko
- may nahulog lang na butil ng baking soda
- napahid ko lang ung Vicks sa mata ko
- allergy lang yan
- natalsikan lang ng toothpaste

^ effective lahat yan. 
3882 2018-03-27 15:35:57 Well, two are the same as yours. Liver & Blue Cheese...but I also dislike olives and snails. I do cook with olive oil, that's something at least, but snails are yucky!
3883 2018-03-27 15:35:56 Pickles? (My head hurts even more now)

People put all sorts of weird things in hummus too. Hummus is just chickpeas, olive oil, lemon juice and spices. Otherwise it's a dip.
3884 2018-03-27 15:35:21 Yea, I was out of town for 5 days. Plus last time I got an oil change, the service tech said my battery was at 70%, which as you said is better for warmer temps but won’t cut it in this rainy, cold weather.
3885 2018-03-27 15:35:07 I’m so tired of the completely illegitimate numbers these gun control advocates just throw out there. How many crimes have been committed with illegal handguns? When they can tell me none then we can talk about gun control.
3886 2018-03-27 15:34:59 Very cautious, recent climb crude oil. Suspect, crude oil prices will fall, going from Spring to summer. Hold no position.

3891 2018-03-27 15:34:40 La #AFIP rechazó darle una moratoria a la empresa de #CristobalLopez, Oil Combustibles, sobre la deuda de más de $ 17.000 millones que reclama el organismo y la deja muy cerca de la quiebra: hasta ahora los empresarios se negaron a pagar esa deuda con su propio dinero. #Zoom
3892 2018-03-27 15:34:39 What are you doing for oil and gas workers, besides crushing the industry with taxes and killing pipelines? Steel is a small percentage of GDP, the energy sector is 25%. I don't suppose you know that, being merely a virtue signalling buffoon.
3893 2018-03-27 15:34:37 How can it be established that the snake oil salesmen had any affect on the outcome of elections. It certainly improved its balance sheet. I am amazed that organisations are prepared to spend large amounts of money on a project for which there can be no measure of effectiveness
3894 2018-03-27 15:34:23 lol, no beard oil or anything. I did have Asian food with sesame oil though?  haha
3895 2018-03-27 15:34:20 Yes. I’ve been following her work, and, to be honest, it hits at a number of issues I’ve sensed and has led me to an almost ministerial existential crisis. I don’t want us to foster “snake oil salesmen” through the reward of big personalities alone.
3896 2018-03-27 15:34:14 Oh they do happen, but all of that oil is getting shipped by train, which is waaay more dangerous. I worked cleaning up a spill last summer and the environmental guy said that trucks and trains keep him busy year round.
3897 2018-03-27 15:34:08 btch 2 weeks pa lang na nako na gamit ang tea tree oil pero hapit na mahurot

3901 2018-03-27 15:33:42 I put some peppermint oil on my scalp lastnight and swear I can still feel the tingle
3902 2018-03-27 15:33:29 Notice Pepsi doesn’t even make the list. One the best cokes ever cost like £18 and came with some olive oil, 20 menthol smokes and some chips - that first day in Qatar #5yearsago
3903 2018-03-27 15:33:21 Clearly not the Morons. Ppl that care nothing about Law & Order, yet want to throw on their hats, & jump on their horse  & play sheriffs. I live in TX, Ppl are pouring in expecting to get their own horse, , oil well& land! Like this is Bonanza! Which was filmed in Lk Tahoe

3905 2018-03-27 15:33:15 Ugh, it’s one of my most disliked things ever. Being gasbombed by perfumery like a 2nd hand smoker! Mum used to used hairspray in the morning that filled the bathroom. Dad uses Eucalyptus massage oil after a night’s shower. Yuk yuk yuk 
3906 2018-03-27 15:33:07 Without any beard oil? Dang, shiny shiny. Maybe you ate some coconut oil or something recently, lol.
3907 2018-03-27 15:33:05 Yes. I felt a shift yesterday at around 11:45 am. It was powerful. My 3rd eye is opening as a result of taking the Holy oil as well. The evil ones LIED and told people not to bother reading the Old Testament where the truth about the Holy oil is.

3915 2018-03-27 15:32:15 I'm pretty sure that this same event is causing foundation issues in my home. I've got fresh cracks in the dry wall since fracking has boomed happened. Sadly the oil/natural gas royalties isn't even enough to cover the structural damages if you live on a small lot.
3916 2018-03-27 15:32:02 If "None of these will remove your guns from your custody", then what's the point? 

Not to mention the pointlessness of your suggestions from any practical standpoint, and the abject failure of authorities who had similar existing laws in FLA.
3917 2018-03-27 15:31:58 It looks like it was painted on a Tatami mat. Is that the case or is it an extremely high level oil painting?
3918 2018-03-27 15:31:57 Oil companies should arrange for a group of oil patch workers to defend the law, if the government won’t.  I suspect they won’t be as gentle as the RCMP.
3919 2018-03-27 15:31:51 I did my apprenticeship in an oil refinery, so I know all the danger there.

3922 2018-03-27 15:31:28 I'M thinking this oil change was bout to be $24.99. Then they hit me with u need a full synthetic oil change.
3923 2018-03-27 15:31:27 A que ya no hay recursos. Se terminaron los yacimientos convencionales en agua profundas los que quedan son en aguas ultraprofundas y los no convencionales lo que requiere mayor tecnología y más dinero.
Además de que México ya pasó su "peak oil" O sea la prdcción siempre es menor
3924 2018-03-27 15:31:19 If you experience cravings when you smell certain foods, try placing a small amount of peppermint essential oil on your shirt collar
3925 2018-03-27 15:31:01 This is the gist - Ramnad Kingdom's queen Velu Nachiyar's army commander Kuyili doused herself with oil, set herself ablaze and walked into a British storehouse of ammunition depriving British of crucial ammunition. Thus she secured the victory for the queen against British.
3926 2018-03-27 15:30:57 Hard at work on it... Stocking up on midnight oil.
3927 2018-03-27 15:30:57 Like, why do Australians pour oil on their gardens? 
To keep guns from rusting!
Stay strong common sense people are under attack everywhere!
3928 2018-03-27 15:30:54 So you will visit an oil company but not your constituents? I will give you my speedy points for a #TownHall
3929 2018-03-27 15:30:45 If Justin was actually a leader instead of a peoplkind snowflake, he'd be working so that no oil is imported thus maximizing jobs and taxes for program spending. Ironically he wants lots of program spending but on our kids credit cards.
3930 2018-03-27 15:30:41 Settlements (financial transactions) for Russian oil deliveries to China, which have reached 60 million tons per year, can be done without using the dollar.  This may be a manipulation of currency on China's behalf or a negotiation strategy. Russia-China military exercising also.
3931 2018-03-27 15:30:40 @Hemptations My Wolfhound is having issues with separation anxiety. I was told to try CBD oil. Do you sell it in your Sharonville store?

3934 2018-03-27 15:30:32 I wouldn’t blame them, but sometimes it makes sense to take the high road.

Everyone with historical perspective can see that this is about Russia, Iran, China, Syria, & Venezuela going off petrodollar standard and selling oil for gold or Yuan. That’s what this is all about...

No, seriously, I will pay... a lot :(
3942 2018-03-27 15:29:40 Forget everything else just the fact trump has unleashed American oil and couldn't care less about the environment regs is enough to eventually cripple Russia economy as most of Wealth is based on it..the fact this point is ignored by media says everything..
3943 2018-03-27 15:29:37 It concerns me that so many women bring their cars with them to college and don’t know basics like checking oil & fluids, tire pressure etc... you ain’t gotta be a mechanic but you should know that lol
3944 2018-03-27 15:29:36 And I agree there should be more discussion and inclusion of native people in the planning. But it seems like they will protest any oil and gas project so it's kind of hard.
3945 2018-03-27 15:29:32 Methotrexate and CBD oil at a low % for now Untill I can get hands on better one
3946 2018-03-27 15:29:28 burning the midnight oil, apparently
3947 2018-03-27 15:29:27 Ok. To point #2, U are talking about the (possible) "real" reasons for the war...the gov & ppl in power's reason. The vast majority of ppl did not support the war in Afghanistan by saying "yeah!! let's go invade them for poppies!", and in Iraq it wasn't "we want oil" by citizens
3948 2018-03-27 15:29:14 I prophecy you will never lack oil 
3949 2018-03-27 15:29:13 Ah yes, what a relief!  Rates are more tolerable even if the costs differ for the exact same distance and travel time. Also, you can stop right where you need to be w/out wasting time looking for a parking space! No need for carwash, gas and oil to boot!
3950 2018-03-27 15:29:04 Better off waiting about 30 minutes than 5 hours for an oil change. I got here so early tho. So good for me lol

4034 2018-03-27 15:20:14 I think it depends mostly on the polyunsaturated omega-6 content. Olive and avocado oil are mostly monounsaturated with very little polyunsaturated. Corn oil is pretty high in omega-6.

4138 2018-03-27 15:08:35 My parents used to do oil wraps on  my chest. Maybe google that. It used to help my cough.

4140 2018-03-27 15:08:29 Yesterday China launched the PetroYuan. It's astonishing people don't know about this. All major oil producing countries are no longer requiring PetroDollar for trades and China is even offering tax incentives for using PetroYuan. You were saying?
4141 2018-03-27 15:08:19 Really, we should move to the praries while the getting is good. ;) But part of their market has been artificially inflated by oil workers going home with AB income. Look at the ratios though:

YXE: a house is 3.08 years of salary
YQR: 2.85
YOW: 3.57
YUL: 4.35
YYC: 4.13

4144 2018-03-27 15:07:48 What's with the pic of oil production when this is about natural gas? ? (Question not actually directed at you Max, just pointing out more of the stupidity from cbc)
4145 2018-03-27 15:07:46 Jimmy Cater wasn’t the best President, but he also wasn’t the worst. He had to deal with stagflation, Soviet aggression, an oil embargo, and the Iranian threat. He was in the right office at the wrong time. However he more than atoned for his failings with the Carter Center.

4177 2018-03-27 15:04:19 I just read about that oil. Wondering if it would help with my joints and other problems. Is it expensive?
4178 2018-03-27 15:04:16 & all of our skin is dif. I had to stop telling ppl to stop using shit that didn't work for me just bc my face wasn't here for it. I was so weary of coconut oil bc comedogenic ratings (which are kinda bs) & my skin is fine w it. Hates viscous oils w lower comedogenic ratings
4179 2018-03-27 15:04:12 I have plan ..diesl car on veg oil manufacture them..modify soybean more oil genetics. Huge global impact
4180 2018-03-27 15:04:09 That’s why wages are so low here. In Norway they saved oil money. Alberta spends itself into debt because we think oil will bail us out.  No concept of long term consequences here.

4189 2018-03-27 15:03:29 Hi Sade. We can definitely not! We actually don't use beef tallow in our fry oil. Our fries are made without any animal sources at all, and cooked in 100% vegetable oil in a dedicated fryer separated from our meat items.
4190 2018-03-27 15:03:23 Toilets have NO religion. All are in your mind. Please apply some coconut oil. You must be free from unethical, one sided journalism. Keep your your tongue straight.  That's it.

4194 2018-03-27 15:02:55 If I have my headphones in, while I’m waiting for my oil change, that means don’t talk to me and don’t try to sell me another new car 
4195 2018-03-27 15:02:39 You do realize the reason why Africa is the way it is is because the entire world feeds off of Africas resources.

4199 2018-03-27 15:02:23 Copying the behavior of oil tycoon/dictators, while ignoring the environmental risks & railroading the democratic demands of Canadian citizens is hardly a legacy.

4205 2018-03-27 15:01:46 I only know there’s a oil burn limit of 0,9l per 100 km during a race. According to FIA they can monitor that. The amounts you’ve mentioned, from where (link?) did you get this?
4206 2018-03-27 15:01:46 Ok. I agree. But you know what you need in the transition, and manufacturing of those? Oil. And lots of it. I'm super excited to be completely green, but we need oil to transition.

4212 2018-03-27 15:01:12 To be clear, I mean US reserves. Haven't looked at global numbers, which is probably more relevant for the oil piece.
4213 2018-03-27 15:01:09 I hate having to deal with car stuff. I don’t know anything about oil and all that jazz 
4214 2018-03-27 15:01:07 There are dry/no-rinse shampoos that come in a spray can instead! They're mainly good at removing excess oil. You spray them on and then use a comb to brush them out. I have a can I use for days when I'm too tired/overwhelmed to shower but still want to freshen up. :3

Independents continue to play a huge role in shale -- and likely will! In fact, the largest gas reserve holder today is an independent (EQT), not Exxon, as previously. (Not sure about oil.)

4243 2018-03-27 14:58:03 I gained about 2mpg (and some response) by changing from 10W-50 in the Subaru to 5W-40. I think you'll probably notice a difference! A little easier on the oil pump too, particularly when cold.
4244 2018-03-27 14:57:50 Let's keep it real. At some point, statistically, you or a loved one will be the victim of a mass shooting. Will you stop jerking off to dead children when you have to claim the body of one of your own?
4245 2018-03-27 14:57:50 The rest of the world doesn't care much about what _you_ want. Current incentives are meant to give new technologies the little push they need to be able to compete on markets that are asphyxiated by the quasi-monopoly of oil companies and the like.

4248 2018-03-27 14:57:30 All major news outlets need to take a look at the coverage they are providing.

4264 2018-03-27 14:56:25 Been there, during a road trip in my old truck... we kind of put a rock through the oil pan.. and drove it to the shop... 
hiked like 10 miles, bought a new one, and had to take it out of the dodge in the rain, on a mountain... then we broke an axle shaft...

4266 2018-03-27 14:56:07 I bought some oil to treat migranes from a herbalist in Sri Lanka and he instructed me to rub it into my head at the sign of a migrane. I just did that and now my head smells like smoked paprika crisps.
4267 2018-03-27 14:56:06 I won't take the risk of making you all look at pics of this, but I just gotta say, one thing I seriously take for granted living in WA is how goddamn clean the ground is! Seriously, 48 hours in AZ and my soles look like I spent a week in an oil pit.

4270 2018-03-27 14:56:04 The green party also ignores the thousands of First Nations people that suport the oil and gas industry. They make it sound as if they are standing up for all First Nations,  when in fact they are not.
4271 2018-03-27 14:55:53 Need a fill, pedicure and my eyebrows done. Also need to get an oil change. Once that’s done I’m gonna be in bed watching movies for the rest of the day lol.

4273 2018-03-27 14:55:48 Pleased to attend the Oil Refining Sector APPG reception this lunchtime. Nice to hear positive comment from minister Claire Perry with regard to the sectors expertise and contribution to the economy.

4281 2018-03-27 14:54:57 How about the Oil industry????
4282 2018-03-27 14:54:55 Oh you know what's another thing we def should get with oil money? Really good homeless shelters. Like ones that take you to non-homelessness and include therapy. Also, prisons where you're forced to learn trades plus do weekly therapy.
4283 2018-03-27 14:54:49 But then the resulting high oil prices boost EV uptake, which destroys more demand and eventually hurts the big oil companies....it's a bit of a circular argument.

4294 2018-03-27 14:53:04 Because we need it? Because it will stop us importing oil from the middle east, where women are treated like dogs. Because it will be an economic lifesaver for Alberta. Because it is the safest way to transport and export petroleum products.

4315 2018-03-27 14:51:18 Q rico gusto tiene el gas oil 
4316 2018-03-27 14:51:07 How do you get oil stains out of clothes?
4317 2018-03-27 14:51:03 Easy: sauté minced garlic (to taste; I use 3-4 cloves) in olive oil; when golden, add 1 large can crushed tomatoes; stir. Add chopped fresh basil, stir in, and simmer until ready to eat. Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy!
4318 2018-03-27 14:50:32 Why am I so amused at the plight of the fishermen & oil workers in the north east & elsewhere in Scotland. Simples, I cannot see ONE LOGICAL REASON why anyone could believe voting Tory would help Scotland. It never has & never will.

4320 2018-03-27 14:49:58 Absolutely! They give their all to oil companies and forgot about the people. They forgot about the kids, the teachers. It’s so disappointing.

4338 2018-03-27 14:47:57 Far from clear to me that the majors benefit from a world of price-constrained discipline. Maybe. 

But also the case that they specialize in big, complex projects. In a world with no need for the top of the cost curve (oil sands, ultra deepwater) it's OPEC + shale that rule.

4391 2018-03-27 14:43:11 It’s surprisingly challenging to use oil as an adverb, but I managed to sneak it in when describing how the ambrosia (robot lifeblood) stagnated on the soil during the battle. Oilily stagnated were the words. Ms Word hates me hehhehe

4416 2018-03-27 14:40:37 Hate waiting on oil changes.
4417 2018-03-27 14:40:34 I'm so sorry to hear about your struggles with PTSD.  As a practitioner, I've found great benefits by using high quality CBD oil to help calm and balance those that have dealt with trauma.   I hope you find what you need to heal, love.   <3
4418 2018-03-27 14:40:29 She said that it could be carrots? Or facial oil?

4420 2018-03-27 14:40:20 I usually switch between L’Oréal extraordinary and Original & Mineral (check out Sephora). And if I feel like splurging, Ouai Rose Hair and Body Oil (and try to justify it by telling myself that it’s multipurpose)

4426 2018-03-27 14:39:34 Yet foreign oil gets a free ride on carbon tax here as well imported energy like over solar and wind are created where there isn’t carbon taxes and chit environmental standards and worker standards. There should be a carbon import tax on foreign energy imports

4433 2018-03-27 14:38:59 There many problems with this argument. Oil have to be refine, wells need to be made, oil/gas need to be transported across the sea. Coal need to be mined. That it. It not imported. Less then 40% of the US power grid is coal. Every other energy is equal or cleaner then gas is.
4434 2018-03-27 14:38:56 Two weeks ago I was long on FTSE and oil. Closed my oil position. And long on FB

4437 2018-03-27 14:38:39 my favourite "balance" is:
-"this is Dr smith, with 40 years in the field of climate science, 25 published papers, recognition by his peers etc" to talk about climate change,
-and "some bloke from a think tank sponsored by oil companies" to present the opposing view...
4438 2018-03-27 14:38:39 I’m gettin these ppl oil change for Orkin shit bet not Be high
4439 2018-03-27 14:38:37 This is going to really complicate our plans to invade Venezuela and fund it by taking their oil.

4449 2018-03-27 14:37:13 Why do you care what someone, born with a silver spoon up his rear, who never had a honest job and was always the lackey for big oil, thinks of you Julian? They don't care about us, it's time we stop caring, and paying, for them.
4450 2018-03-27 14:36:59 I haven’t tried oil or other extracts for it… and at this point I see little point in trying.
4451 2018-03-27 14:36:55 yoo this mutherfuckin honey turkey sub with crushed hot peppers oil mayo & pickles with jalepeno chips is soooo good !!

4454 2018-03-27 14:36:23 The Euro is an alternative. Before you laugh.. The Euro is the 2nd biggest ccy in the world. It's actually used by more ppl than the USD, more ccy's are pegged to it, it's the biggest gold holder, net creditor and 2 thirds of oil is traded on Brent.
4455 2018-03-27 14:36:12 getting my oil changed & getting my nail fixed are the only reason i’m getting out the house today
4456 2018-03-27 14:36:03 Trauma is heart wrenching.  As a practitioner, I've found that CBD oil helps tremendously with PTSD.
4457 2018-03-27 14:36:01 EYE need to order more oil
4458 2018-03-27 14:35:54 @FelicityHuffman the Global Warming/ Climate Change meeting. It like billionaires Tom Steyer and George Soros made alot of their money in oil. Obama was on 2 different cruises a few months back with Billionaire, Richard Branson! Al Gore is an ex-Vice President, but he's worth
4459 2018-03-27 14:35:53 Are you allergic to unrefined coconut oil?
This is a great natural lubricant. It could be used with non-latex condoms.! It’s also very healthy for you. I cook with it and use it as a body moisturizer. Good luck.!!

4494 2018-03-27 14:32:17 I wish I wasn’t responsible so I could spend my morning sleeping instead of getting my oil changed and tires rotated.
4495 2018-03-27 14:32:13 Sesame oil + scallions, or nutritional yeast both might be good? Or you could make 'em sweet and mix in sugar.

4499 2018-03-27 14:32:04 I recommend the peeling solution (strong but works), the retinol, and the rose hip seed oil. I didn't love the hyaluronic acid, I've tried better. And the niacinamide didn't really do anything for me.
4500 2018-03-27 14:32:02 The fruits measure 450µm on average so just on the minimum stated in the book. Hadn't considered R.immmersa but can only see sessile fruits and think I can see oil droplets in hymenium.

4564 2018-03-27 14:25:21 The most important numbers to watch out of today's budget will be the numbers on total debt and how we're managing it. Second important number will be where they predict oil to be in the next year.

4569 2018-03-27 14:25:05 #China strong arms #Vietnam into stopping another oil project in South China Sea, despite Vietnam tactic of using foreign investment (Spanish) to do the work. Without #US leadership on the issue, China holds all the cards. Too strong locally to be defied.
4570 2018-03-27 14:24:59 A Reuters poll found that US crude oil stocks likely increased by 420,000 bbls, following a surprise drawdown last week. The build, if confirmed would mark the fourth weekly gain in the last five weeks.

4590 2018-03-27 14:22:52 Just put it in the TransMountain budget. Bonuses for everybody. Reward people for helping us bring our oil to world markets.  It's a small price to pay to finally get the pipeline built, no need to be cheap. The pipeline will pay for that in the first day of operation.
4591 2018-03-27 14:22:50 Bullshit. The weekly gain on my wife's paycheck does not even buy a gallon of fuel oil to heat our home. This should be called "Ryan's Folly"! Or "Ryan's Ripoff"!

4598 2018-03-27 14:22:00 Work safe only enforces and sets regulations for work site safety in BC. The BC OGC is the oversite for specific aspects of the oil and gas industry.  As well, so is the NEB, depending on if the work site ships oil or gas out of Province.
4599 2018-03-27 14:21:52 That sounds amazing. I've never been to Greece but I can attest to the quality of olive oil in nearby Croatia. It's somewhat spoiled me because most stateside olive oils don't compare. I'm partial to Irish butter also, but Trader Joe's has a pretty amazing French cultured butter.

4636 2018-03-27 14:17:47 American oil producers have pumped at least 10 million barrels a day of crude oil for the last 7 weeks, hitting 10.407 million barrels per day for the week ending Friday 3/16/18. The last time US oil producers hit 10 million barrels a day of crude oil was in 1970
4637 2018-03-27 14:17:44 I never said American invented slavery we were talking about American slavery of African-Americans. You are literally jumping back-and-forth like a drop of oil in a hot pan. There are many fallacies for ignorant arguments; other than, deflection.

4702 2018-03-27 14:11:04 Like Venezuela thinking they had the world by the balls until the price of oil collapsed. Now the people in their Socialist paradise starve. All these  dictators get rumbled soon enough.
4703 2018-03-27 14:10:58 Indian Rupee is trading lower today as     some state-owned banks and foreign banks bought the greenback likely for     oil importers and noting its recovery. However, strong dollar index and     purchase of greenback by PSUs weighed on rupee.

4714 2018-03-27 14:09:50 In a delicious moment of irony that has reminded me to turn off my boiler now as I can’t get an oil delivery until after the Bank Holiday and OH won’t be happy if it runs out at w/e when he is back here 
4715 2018-03-27 14:09:42 Oil companies have to support, but don’t believe in it. Canada and Australia are the only nitwits left on the planet that believe it, thanks to excellent class room propaganda. Shocking, governments who want to TAX something for nothing. That totally makes it credible.

4718 2018-03-27 14:09:33 #Russia has blinked. They are in fear of #America flooding the world market with oil & gas (their primary export) which will effectively break them financially in no uncertain terms. Thoughts of the #StarWars program under Reagan. #Maga @realDonaldTrump!

4750 2018-03-27 14:06:25 I don;t know how I missed this! It's easy - buy a face oil and start! I've got a bit of a breakout right now, but I'm persevering nonetheless (dermat told me to - I think it depends person-to-person)! Of course only use at night - oil + sun is not a good idea!
4751 2018-03-27 14:06:19 @Dynamomagician Dude, I have Crohns and had similar joint pain through the drugs that I was on. I’ve used a specific type of fish oil and turmeric tablets and they have helped a lot. I was hobbling like a Grandad before that. Best of luck, DM if you’re interested in the details
4752 2018-03-27 14:06:10 besides pain, the thing about having a cold in my throat that i hate the most is the taste of pennies right in the back of my throat - that place that no tea or juice or water can wash away - and the pennies just sit there and all i can do is try to heal my cold w oil of oregano

4755 2018-03-27 14:05:55 We have become the biggest petroleum manufacturer in the world, since Trump has been elected. Maybe this will loosen our dependence on foreign oil.

I know what oil can do to a body of water. The Gulf of Mexico is a cesspool now. I have not step foot in it since after the BP explosion when I ended up with a burning rash after being it for only 5 minutes.

Save what is left of the Earth we haven't destroyed.

4853 2018-03-27 13:57:28 I agree. What I find really useful is the clarity of @shell’s assumptions & use of an open EXCEL dashboard. It allows faster analysis, critique & learning. One may not agree w/ the post-2070 crude oil tail compensated with NETS, but it’s something for an oil major to publish this
4854 2018-03-27 13:57:28 U.S will only go if Venezuela wants to give up it’s Oil. Venezuela has one of the largest Oil reserves in the world. And why are they poor you ask? Well... no one has touched that oil. Chavez and Maduro screwed Venezuela.

4863 2018-03-27 13:56:31 CPG just rose over 1% when the oil price rose nearly 10 last week..There is something wrong here. Oil companies follow the high yield bond market, which is tanking as there is not enough cash coming in. It is too obvious to think that higher oil means higher share prices.

4869 2018-03-27 13:55:38 How would this Muslim family feel if this Christian doused them with hot oil for not becoming Christians? Fortunately for them, the Bible teaches us that vengeance belongs to God. And we are not to repay evil with evil. We are not God's henchmen. We preach a Christ who loves us.

4981 2018-03-27 13:44:05 Yoona and seo kangjun in bts look adorable n so sweet but in reality she is lol..PBG is being sweet by protecting her from the splashing of hot oil, her reply "I'm ok but I have to wash that pan" ruining ppl fantasy lmaoo..
4982 2018-03-27 13:44:05 Check the labels, too much Palm oil in a lot of cheap chocolate 
4983 2018-03-27 13:44:04 Spray Funcional Turbo Oil. É um óleo lubrificante excitante com "turbo" aquecimento em spray, muito mais prático, causando uma deliciosa sensação de super aquecimento local.

Contém: 15ml

Modo de Usar: Aplicar 2 a 3 vezes no homem e na mulher aplicar antes da penetração.
4984 2018-03-27 13:44:02 Owning a cemetery is a very long term investment for an oil field.
4985 2018-03-27 13:44:02 Tried out tea tree oil today. Applied it on my cheeks and nose 3 hours earlier, and surprisingly I have minimal oil lang on the said parts (even though I have super oily face).
4986 2018-03-27 13:43:55 This proves this guy doesn't understand economics, farming, technology & national security.
1 Adding excess labour to job market suppresses wages for all.
2 Tech replaces labour not create jobs.
3 Who will feed country if not local farmers?
4 Already import oil, food import too?

4989 2018-03-27 13:43:20 Hydrocortisone works great but I only use it at night.. I’ve used coconut oil. I’m currently using African black soap, which is great for eczema & psoriasis.
4990 2018-03-27 13:43:16 tagal naman siya maubos, yung 2nd tube ko lang dati inaraw araw ko sa sobrang naobsess ako sa kanya pero ngayon one or twice a week na lang, tska super cheap din kasi ng isang tube tapos long lasting naman! yung oil parang maganda rin kasi okay naman reviews
4991 2018-03-27 13:43:14 U buy it at the store na. It can only help to control the oil. Even an oil control face wash. Expensive tho
4992 2018-03-27 13:43:02 My son has an ar15 they get drunk and shoot at night. He was a good guy but I don’t know what happened. He makes a lot of money in oil rigs but he’s acting disconnected. He’s 43 and won’t talk to me now. He moved off our land and I feel safer. But I’m worried #guns #abuse #power
4993 2018-03-27 13:42:55 Vegetables. Lots of them and mostly the green ones. Fish. Some fruit. Corn chips/tortillas and avocado smushed to pretend to be guac... coconut butter/oil/milk um... popcorn. Lots of water and tea.
4994 2018-03-27 13:42:47 I just started doing wash n’ go’s, so I’m not the best person to advise you on this. But I usually wash my hair add oil to the scalp, then use eco styler gel and Camille Rose Curl Maker through my hair, so the curls can get really defined

4996 2018-03-27 13:42:30 I told all of my kids when they started getting oil changes to say this. “I need an oil change. If you try to sell me on anything else, I will call my dad, and he will come here and kick your ass.” Works like a charm.
4997 2018-03-27 13:42:29 Hypocrisy! Without oil, you could not have tweeted that comment. There are hundreds of other things made by, shipped with and or is a derivative of petroleum. Until you people start living in a lean too improvised shelter and eating ferns, you are hypocrites!

5006 2018-03-27 13:41:41 $sm asset sale. reaffirms guidance on upper side, oil up, mkts up, high short interest, relatively low float name, and its up 2%? back in the day it would a been up 15% no doubt.

5008 2018-03-27 13:41:28 Having moved here recently I don't think people from here realize how much more the costs are. Two major, 3x more costly.  Doctor visits and oil verse gas.  Why are we stilling burning oil?  Natural gas is 1/3 the cost and cleaner.
5009 2018-03-27 13:41:19 Well duh! You have a lot more white peoples in Texas with oil money than you do PR!
5010 2018-03-27 13:41:13 Stuff the majority of the #British don't want: 
◘Fining the homeless. 
◘Sanctioning countries without showing the public evidence.
◘Bombing for oil.
◘Political correctness.
◘Cannabis being illegal (over 70% would be 90% with education).
◘Comedy being illegal. 
Democracy?
5011 2018-03-27 13:41:03 Steve, you sit in your energy heated home, eat food from energy to using grocery stores, I assume you’d go to energy using medical services if needed, let’s hope not.  You claim environmental care yet you support foreign jurisdictions competing with responsible Canadian Oil. Why?
5012 2018-03-27 13:41:02 Putin has been in power since 2002, owns 2nd biggest oil company in Russia. He wants to weaken Western countries, govt pays people to hack

5015 2018-03-27 13:40:48 We still import 7-8 million barrels a day...why are we exporting any oil at all?
5016 2018-03-27 13:40:47 Coconut oil no good either. A provider tried using that on me
5017 2018-03-27 13:40:44 Haluuu gamit kayo ng kahit anong clay mask na meron kayo, tapos gamitan niyo ng shark oil yung may pimple/s na area dun lang. Tas dry na agad pimples niyo in the morning. Gandang pamilit ng shark oil pag naubusan ka na ng tea tree oil, hehehe.

5032 2018-03-27 13:38:44 The term renewables is completely false. Wind/solar energy rely on elements as finite as oil and gas. Do we need truth in labeling laws to stop such labeling abuse?

5055 2018-03-27 13:36:32 Me too. Dad (an engineer) insisted if I wanted a car I had to learn to maintain it. So he taught me how to change oil & filters etc, clean/change spark plugs, replace timing belt, & fit a whole new exhaust! It was much easier on a 1984 Nissan Cherry than a modern car though!

5063 2018-03-27 13:34:48 It's the wrong season but I can still taste the figs I ate in Athens many summers ago.  Sigh. Greek olive oil is the best  - it must be the Italians buy it to blend.....
5064 2018-03-27 13:34:47 Organic operations can use "natural" products such as copper sulfate... a product that is used in the oil & gas industry.  Scary huh.

As far as oil/gas that’s more difficult since Putin is making deals left & right.

5091 2018-03-27 13:31:05 Okay so depending on the type of car you have, they'll try to convince you that you need a special type of oil, but usually that's not the case, they just want you to get something expensive. They always try to upsell oil to me, so just make sure you say you want conventional oil

5096 2018-03-27 13:30:46 It’s a oil pressure sensor. Local dealer said TSB wouldn’t be covered outside of warranty. It looks like it’s a common failure across multiple dodge, Jeep, Chrysler products. Code P0520. I’ve seen some people able to get help from their manufacture outside of warranty.

5364 2018-03-27 13:03:10 We are being ‘groomed’ for 149.9 this summer. Notice how the ‘floor’ price these past few weeks got higher and higher? The subsequent 10-12 cent hike gets us closer to the 149.9 target each week. Big oil deserves electric cars

5396 2018-03-27 13:00:06 I agree Saudi are involved but the main players are US/EU and Russia and their proxy countries in the Middle East. Shia Iran (Russia) vs Sunni Saudi (US). All about money, power, control and of course energy (gas/oil). Iraqs fallen, US only need Syria now.

5402 2018-03-27 12:59:29 The decision I believe that they were quitting the shale oil business was because to be profitable Oil had to trade above $60. Now that crude is trending close to the $70s what's the rationale?

Your skin might be dry coz you wash with HOT water. The hotter the water, the more the natural oils skin produces are stripped.

Think about it, when you want to dissolve the oil on dishes, hot water and soap do the trick!

5559 2018-03-27 12:39:49 Due to the limited pipeline infrastructure, Alberta oil sells at $20-$30 below World Prices, due to the cost of transport, so our price of oil is actually not $70, but $40. Beyond that, modern SAGD fields can produce oil at $11 which brings our cost to about $40.

5673 2018-03-27 12:25:46 it's not narrow minded to only accept empirical science. the unqualified people who write books about their raw food diet curing cancer are snake oil peddlers that are out for your money and nothing else. don't fall for it.

5684 2018-03-27 12:23:58 Off today so I'll get my baby a wash & oil change this morning
5685 2018-03-27 12:23:46 I listened to this story while driving to work alone and realized that oil pipelines exist to satisfy the petroleum addiction of people like me. #MeaCulpa
5686 2018-03-27 12:23:45 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
5687 2018-03-27 12:23:44 Hey Jules you, I'm just wondering if SS agreed to let YA convert half the loan before news and then BOOOM! The Mother of an RNS is released regarding #BroadfordBridge saying 'We found oil And Gas' . I've got a feeling they have Gas at BB.

5690 2018-03-27 12:23:25 Eric, it is a simple choice. Obstructing Canada’s Gay friendly oil forces the world to buy  tossing dictator oil. I don’t imagine this is your intention but if you protest Gay friendly Oil then you are helping kill . @vancouverpride

5694 2018-03-27 12:22:30 There will always be oil
5695 2018-03-27 12:22:22 everyone knows oil and gold prices are the same in the world,  this idiot saying don't invest in foreign currency, and saying the price of oil is gone up as he is in control of it. having said all of that this idiot thinks people are naive.
5696 2018-03-27 12:22:15 W 2011r wykrylam i udokumentowalam wyludzenia na szkode NFZ i pacjentow,zapowiedziano mi"NFZ jest nasz tak jak prokuratura i OIL,puscimy cie w skarpetkach,skonczysz pod mostem,okrzykniemy wariatem.. nic nam nie zrobisz"Co ze sprawa PK II Ko2770.16 czym sie roznicie od PO-PSL?
5697 2018-03-27 12:21:47 I am aware of that but in the modern world people didn't know what they need they want an expensive car for ex. so they concluded they need it, same with a multitude of other goods such as oil and are willing to get said good out of pure list and greed for it.
5698 2018-03-27 12:21:38 ARAMCO going the way of the  Oil in 10yrs. & Arabia knows, that's Why Bridge going No Where 
5699 2018-03-27 12:21:27 No coverage in US! Seriously, news here was all Stormy Daniels, March against guns and expelling Russian diplos. No one cares about instability in the Middle East anymore? Which is ironic because missiles from Yemen is the 1 thing that could actually impact oil production in KSA

5702 2018-03-27 12:20:56 I’m using Bodyshop tea tree oil; the complete set. However I still have vit E cream wash & vit E hydrating toner. 
Since I left my chamomile oil as my make up remover in my room Hatyai, I’ve been using vit E cream wash as my make up remover these days. But it dries my skin :(
5703 2018-03-27 12:20:39 No doubt.
We sell a body oil with notes similar to those found in oud wood. Check it out
5704 2018-03-27 12:20:33 To be precise — theft of oil sources everywhere they could reach without any risk of being destroyed.
5705 2018-03-27 12:20:33 Gotta start paying attention to the brand of coconut oil I rub on my bitches.
5706 2018-03-27 12:20:23 28% of the expenditure made by oil companies in 2010-13 was made to "Ugandan companies." I put in quotes because Mukwano and Roofings qualify as "Ugandan companies." Not content with robbing us, the raiders now want our parks. How do we benefit?
5707 2018-03-27 12:20:23 The main MVPs are Sunday Riley’s Martian toner (in the am) and their UFO oil to moisturize at night. The last one is The Ordinary’s Niacinimide + Zinc serum in the AM before my No7 oily skin moisturizer.

5717 2018-03-27 12:18:58 Team America, world police. Because of our altruism right? Nothing to do with oil or an industrial military complex, no way man. We just want to help, that’s our motivation.

5720 2018-03-27 12:18:47 Hearing wonderful reports on our new Annihilate the Agony of Pain Herbal Syrup. Use it along with the external cream/salve/oil for helping you make it through the day with any of you pain problems.
5721 2018-03-27 12:18:44 Turn off the oil to BC. Not allow BC to use our pipelines. Toll the highways and rail lines. So many options that no one wants to explore. Not good for anyone.
5722 2018-03-27 12:18:40 Ok...and why didnt oil prices react?
5723 2018-03-27 12:18:40 @NaomiWhittel So I tried making AutophaTea with what I had around. Boiled cinnamon sticks, blended in matcha, Brain Octane, and bergamot essential oil. It... did not taste great. Matcha might be too strong.

So I got the original ingredients yesterday. Much better!
5724 2018-03-27 12:18:31 Hmmm...which side would win?
The side with guns, or those wishing to do without?
5725 2018-03-27 12:18:27 Over working the engine is probably why it burns a little more oil than normal
5726 2018-03-27 12:18:23 Coconut oil, castor oil, moropotso and my wigs, have been good to my hair..

* domestic oil & fracking
* anti-Iran
* expanded Magnitsky
* 60 expelled diplomats

5779 2018-03-27 12:10:48 There was also negative carry-over from Friday's Baker Hughes report that U.S. active oil rigs in the week ended Mar 23 rose by +4 rigs to a 2-3/4 year high of 804 rigs.
5780 2018-03-27 12:10:40 Monday's closes: May crude -0.33 (-0.50%), May gasoline -0.0212 (-1.04%). May crude oil and gasoline on Monday closed lower on a lack of damage to Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure after a missile attack Sunday from Houthi rebels.

5788 2018-03-27 12:10:11 No doubt you have great policy in place. But it's unsustainable without your amazing financial cushion of oil wealth.
5789 2018-03-27 12:10:02 Not necessarily. The Porsche 911 had an oil leak problem for years but they couldn’t fix it for some reason. A Camry at that point was a better car. It fulfilled the same purpose as the 911 (transportation) for a lower price and more reliably.

5856 2018-03-27 12:00:52 Good question. Let me take a stab.
Both Bush41 @ 43 had PERSONAL interests in the oil industry. The cost of doing business with SArabia was letting in as many rag-heads as SA demanded. Putting 120K troops in SA in 1990 did not endear us to muslims. It inflamed them to target U.S.

6018 2018-03-27 11:34:05 If the trade war worsens, most likely there will be a sell off initially which gives an opportunity to open positions for gold / silver / other metals and even oil. I see this as a short term opportunity. Long term I believe in crypto as stated below

6082 2018-03-27 11:22:05 This is probably my favourite kale recipe. Except for the one where you dry the kale, spray it with extra virgin olive oil, skewer a marshmallow on a stick, then light the kale on fire and toast the marshmallow over it.

6227 2018-03-27 10:55:16 Just read Golden Sachs MAGICAL THINKING views on the Golden Age of Oil "? Cutting edge they obviously are not. Oblivious to climate change and the renewable s taking over .
6228 2018-03-27 10:55:04 This generation will have no excuses to give should they miss the rapture. Lets go fill our lamps with oil at the Nakuru main altar this easter as we await the return of the Messiah #EasterwithProphetDrOwuor
6229 2018-03-27 10:54:17 Hmm, I always recommend elixir for the lasting effects, it costs between 12-20?

On my practice guitar, an elixir can stay unoxidised for about a year, considering I oil them after each practice. Maybe once a month xD 

Tone does degrade but im not particular during practice.
6230 2018-03-27 10:53:43 Now I know why in Oil and Gas operator companies they have 3 different job groups.
- Tier 1 : Limited resources / require more time to understand the field.
- Tier 2 : Technical work but same application regardless different industries. 
- Tier 3 : Support unit - less complexity.
6231 2018-03-27 10:53:26 God will punish poverty very well. 40 strokes of cane because of 7000 naira?!!.
There are things my mother believed a child shouldn't  be flogged for....broken plates, lost money,spilled oil....
6232 2018-03-27 10:53:05 #Fact.

Apo Oil Well belongs to Sapetro Oil. It has 500m oil reserve with a daily production capadity of 300,000 barrel.

The company is owned by TY Danjuma.

President Buhari is the only military leader who owns no filling station talk less of oil fields.
He's a contented man.

6236 2018-03-27 10:51:52 Antara tips penjagaan muka yg aku rajin buat dulu kala. Makan madu+virgin olive oil every morning. Tapi since madu dah habis, aku stop dah benda ni. So kena mula balik. Oleh itu marilah shopping madu.
6237 2018-03-27 10:51:42 Oh man! That's some crazy shit right there! Today at the pharmacy, in the essential oil's basket,...they had turpentine oil,... not a joke! 
6238 2018-03-27 10:51:20 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
6239 2018-03-27 10:50:59 Coconut oil, Kerrygold, and heavy whipping cream
6240 2018-03-27 10:50:51 I usually use the Body Shop honey bronze dry oil in the summer. It’s gorgeousss

6246 2018-03-27 10:49:50 Culture isn’t static. “Norwegian culture” is vastly different from only 50 years ago. Huge shifts in values, influenced by lots, including ‘68, Hollywood, the Cold War, technology and oil wealth. Immigration is pretty far down on that list, very modest influence.
6247 2018-03-27 10:49:49 This is a real shame. Algeria offering Tax Incentives to develop their oil resources while Canada’s Liberal and NDP Governments use Foreign Incentives to keep our oil resources in the ground. Next thing you know they will build a pipeline to import that oil to our refineries
6248 2018-03-27 10:49:48 'Western oil major' - shy of disclosing their name?
6249 2018-03-27 10:49:42 Tell john to get the oil ready I'll see him Friday
6250 2018-03-27 10:49:33 in a "dividing the country" battle who would win? the fact that the "united states" is founded on stolen indigenous land and was built by slaves, and continues to invade countries for oil and normalizes fascism OR my tweets.

6253 2018-03-27 10:49:06 Tea tee oil and vitamin e oil have really improved the look of my skin.
6254 2018-03-27 10:49:00 I would help, just need to find out what an ‘oil’ tablecloth is? Presume that isn’t a tablecloth soaked in oil . . ? Does it just mean waterproof, or do people not say that now?
6255 2018-03-27 10:48:59 Sarap nung chicken oil huhu please take me sa mang inasal :(
6256 2018-03-27 10:48:54 People, pay attention to what the Chinese &(Russia)are doing right now. They’re silently taking over power. Looking to take the $$ off oil. Trump screwed a porn star, ok. Let’s keep our eye on what’s happening globally because our economy and way of life depends on it.
6257 2018-03-27 10:48:48 Hey guys if you don't use coconut oil on the daily you should rly try it.

6263 2018-03-27 10:47:42 I wish Russia blocks all your gas and oil supplies @EU_Commission You are too prejudiced...instead of solidarity in hour of tragedy you are handing out expulsions @Europarl_EN @UN
6264 2018-03-27 10:47:26 Castor oil is my favorite thing on the planet right now. My eyebrows are THICC 
6265 2018-03-27 10:47:25 Thanks TLG, Initially it was @DDS_DocHoliday who gave me the tip, a long while ago. I looked at the fundamentals and followed it through the mud and here we are today. On the cusp of a damn good oil producer, with news flow abundant to come.
6266 2018-03-27 10:47:05 うぃす！！！配信も今度行きますね〜
6267 2018-03-27 10:47:01 #Iraq still in talks with Kurds to resume Kirkuk oil exports to Ceyhan via Kurdish pipeline

6268 2018-03-27 10:46:58 said on @foxandfriends at my but did @oreillyfactor for Saturday to grandstand. @SenTedCruz had she should demand their oil. Stupid U.S.
6269 2018-03-27 10:46:57 For instance we complain about oil subsidy, whereas oil subsidy is simply a trade deal involving Nigeria exporting crude oil and getting refined crude in return. It is not in favor if our country at the moment.
6270 2018-03-27 10:46:34 El barco está más viejo y sucio que La Santa María y apesta a gas oil, sin mencionar los tres días y tres noches de mala mar que llevamos y que no le ponen fin por no pagar más atraques
6271 2018-03-27 10:46:33 … to say nothing of the fact that the earth will cook if we burn the oil we are pumping out now, let alone new oil… #climatechange

6283 2018-03-27 10:45:19 He was corrupt whilst PM and represented Europe and not the UK whilst PM. 
He was corrupt and represented America in taking us to war. 
And he is STILL corrupt and STILL representing the EU rather than the UK. 
He is a champion snake oil salesman. 
And always will be.
6284 2018-03-27 10:45:16 And you will be the one to pour oil on troubled waters, of course...
6285 2018-03-27 10:45:05 The West wants to control Syria's oil and Russia's resources... if not with their hedge funds then with military might.
6286 2018-03-27 10:44:47 @KrissyHolmes it can happen on oil rigs,verbal physical sexual assault less than year ago,coworkers interviewed,no one saw anything,young man back to work,victim left for lower pay job, company basically calls victim liar. Reality today

6295 2018-03-27 10:42:57 And, buying Saudi oil and shipping it by super tanker (which runs on bunker oil, the dirtiest fuel known to man) negates any CO2 advantage there may have been.

6301 2018-03-27 10:42:12 Have you tried CBD oil? Husband uses it (orally and vapes it with a 0% nicotine vaping juice) for his Fibromyalgia, and it works wonders. Might be worth investigating?
