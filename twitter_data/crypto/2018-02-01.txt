2 2018-02-01 23:59:48 There is a difference between PRICE and VALUE. The price of Crypto is dropping because of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The core value of crypto hasn’t changed. The price will rise/fall to meet its value. Don’t sell your crypto unless you think it’s value has lessened.
3 2018-02-01 23:59:48 Remember 
The stronger the force that pulls you down,
The stronger the bounce will be!!!!

Get ready

17 2018-02-01 23:58:11 Is it only me or most of ICO teams forget about security and how to protect user’s personal data, including e-mail addresses? Such incompetence and ignorance results in well-played scams. #crypto #noobseverywhere #facepalm @thebeetoken @dadi
