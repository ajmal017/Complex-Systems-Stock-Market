but
(1) I wish they put baked beans in it, and
(2) I wish oil didn’t just burst out of the bottom once I got to the last inch of the burrito

38 2018-03-22 23:57:21 DOH US squatters illegally inside Syria setting up illegal bases to steal Syrian Oil.. Where do you get the gaul to say anything about what Syrian are doing in their own country?
39 2018-03-22 23:57:17 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
40 2018-03-22 23:56:52 Honestly I have never worked for such a backward insular city council. No though of how to make the oil industry work for the city no thought for the less well off & absolutely no vision. Aberdeen used to be a beautiful city it has been betrayed by unionists!
41 2018-03-22 23:56:50 As of September 2014, foreigners owned $6.06 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $12.8 trillion and 34% of the total debt of $17.8 trillion. The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters.

45 2018-03-22 23:55:52 just heat up some oil and pan fry some minced garlic. ur house will just smell of garlic

47 2018-03-22 23:55:43 I thought it was impossible to heal the human body without patchouli oil, but I stand corrected
48 2018-03-22 23:55:30 Norway’s oil production is offshore so it’s not even the same comparing it to Alberta’s. whether oil comes from Canada or Saudi Arabia it will get produced. I prefer to know Alberta’s is produced ethically. Holding back Canada’s production only helps the US and that makes 0 sense
49 2018-03-22 23:55:20 MY SPRING BREAK STARTS TOMORROW AND I WILL CELEBRATE BY getting an oil change and cleaning up around the house. lol.

55 2018-03-22 23:54:46 BTW Iraq war was Great by Bush ! "John Bolton"  is Great  he make Middle east great by pushing for new war with Turkey & Iran &Iraq  &syria ! we should not allow Russia and Turkey  & Iran have oil  ! otherwise you have rdie donkey to go to work !  #trump1020
56 2018-03-22 23:54:41 It is quite obvious that this man is picked to sell new propaganda to the people of France, as well as internationally. After helping rid Libya of Gaddafi, France has been enabling a new would-be military dictator, Haftar. To get its share of oil again?
57 2018-03-22 23:54:34 who fucking knew olive oil and apple cider vinegar w ground flax seed would be so god damn good together no more taking in toxic condiments
58 2018-03-22 23:54:31 but i locking oil
59 2018-03-22 23:54:30 I always buy/use Italian canned tomatoes, preferably San Marzano. It's hard/expensive to buy really good olive oil, & much of it is fake/blended with other oils or worse things.
60 2018-03-22 23:54:26 Im all for medical use but not so sure about recreational use.  Smoking it is still bad  4 u..not as bad as tobacco but it still does the same thing . Ive seen cannabis oil do wonders however. In order for more reaserch tho it needs to be legal.
61 2018-03-22 23:54:22 Garlic/honey and acv then Sundown natural b-12 dropper first thing in the morning.  After lunch it’s magnesium/calcium/zinc, and fish oil at night is what I take.  Kombucha daily lol
62 2018-03-22 23:54:19 CBD oil, comes in glass bottle, with a dropper (each full dropper amount is one dosage), called "Tonic," mint flavored, helps me with my anxiety and depression

67 2018-03-22 23:53:33 Same things she said...
Basically the same principles we hold shell and chevron to.
If allowed to only pay tax, they won't care about the environment and the people within. They will simple drill the oil, take d money to their country and not develop the community.

70 2018-03-22 23:52:37 It’s a handy tool. I use it to dry frites after removing from water before oil blanching & frying. Drying poultry skin before roasting also a great use!
71 2018-03-22 23:52:33 4 hours for an oil change , a bitch starvin
72 2018-03-22 23:52:22 Maybe. Norway’s oil production is also all offshore.
73 2018-03-22 23:52:20 Honestly, #Klein did this is years of high oil prices. Do you think we're too stupid to realize that? The #NDP kept the lights on in #Alberta during the downturn. Now they have a plan to get back to a #balancedbudget.

77 2018-03-22 23:51:52 1. Because Putin wants him to.  Food for thought, does Putin have info on Bolton as well? Perhaps he knows where the oil money went when Iraq was invaded.
78 2018-03-22 23:51:42 looks like what motor oil on blacktop looks like after it rains. Obviously this isn't nature.
79 2018-03-22 23:51:27 @TheOceanCleanup @ScienceNews @sciam Could we not have a #bioplastic(as has been feasible for 5 yrs+ now) then their is a definite Lifespan on the carrier bottle etc for instant use purpose,breakdown is a simple oil (again) as the anti slick detergents act (in principle) ?Regards
80 2018-03-22 23:51:23 Personally, I'm all for the way Esperanto is looking to outgrow any gender bias. Unfortunately English is the proverbial oil tanker compared..
81 2018-03-22 23:51:07 Water, water and not a drop to drink. Maybe because it is clogged with garbage, oil, toxic chemicals, etc. So, dummies, what do you do? CLEAN IT UP! Wisdom from hijanetlee.
82 2018-03-22 23:50:56 H.R. MCMASTER CAT OUT, JOHN BOLTEN CAT IN.

THIS TIME WHEN WE GO INTO IRAQ, WE KEEP THE OIL. WHY NOT?

MEOW MEOW MEOW PURRR
83 2018-03-22 23:50:48 It happened to me. I was afraid  but took a chance, tasted like used motor oil.... and i fell in love with it!!!!! Still am.  I am salivating just by watching mr Nobu.

90 2018-03-22 23:50:20 It's almost like the previous government should have put away money when it was 100$  plus a barrel for oil 
91 2018-03-22 23:50:03 We've some Oil. Olive Oil.
But it's so much less of a war-trigger. Agreed.
Good for salads and soffritto for tomato sauce. The real one, not the one sold "as if" abroad.
92 2018-03-22 23:50:01 My beard alias is throne after I apply lil bit of coconut oil for the record

100 2018-03-22 23:49:07 Every liter smuggled means that a business is losing money. The oil businesses need to stop this from happening.

103 2018-03-22 23:48:39 i am however an advocate for oil pulling w. coconut, sesame, whatever your choice is.  i trust that more.  especially since it helps with inflammation and allat.
104 2018-03-22 23:48:27 Don't forget he routinely clobbers his predecessors getting in and out of Iraq. He isn't doing it that way.  I think he will secure oil fields and fight over that. Winning for him is probably making the most money in each country.
105 2018-03-22 23:47:56 Be thankful Italia has no oil. I've spoken to many Arabs who say oil is a curse. I imagine many Iranians will soon feel the same.
106 2018-03-22 23:47:44 I can RT stuff about olive oil. Does that count?

110 2018-03-22 23:47:22 Im not familiar with the standar oil situation so you’ll have to forgive me with that
111 2018-03-22 23:47:17 Apparently there is a huge demand for chevy Cruze oil feed lines. $20 part all out of stock everywhere going for $120 on eBay. People flipping these for mad profit, ballin so hard!
112 2018-03-22 23:47:15 Tillerson was hired by Putin to put through a 500 billion Exxon/Russia oil deal in the Ukraine. Exxon exits the deal cause of sanctions and boom Tillerson is gone. No pity here.
113 2018-03-22 23:47:02 O! Cannabinoid oil? Can't get any around here.
114 2018-03-22 23:47:00 fundermental difference between oil companies, and regulating public opinion via social media. That’s how freedom of speech gets eroded. Platforms should be responsible for extremist content being published, but government should not be allowed to manipulate through regulation.

- she put 80k into her 67(?) Chevy malibu. (it's crashed now)
- she sang phantom of the Opera. All of it on her own.
121 2018-03-22 23:46:44 So where did the surplus go during the years When oil was sitting at $100  a barrel ???
122 2018-03-22 23:46:43 How much less could they have paid if the #TaxScam pushed solar and wind vs letting oil and coal to continue trashing the state. Let's talk about enwrgy independence!

135 2018-03-22 23:45:14 Because of course we all know the former Secretary of State would have been less given to diplomacy than the guy who called for carpet bombing & stealing oil 
136 2018-03-22 23:45:11 What climate change was all about, power shift from coal, gas, oil tycoons to the shysters like good old Al.
137 2018-03-22 23:45:04 Chest, left shoulder, and underarm. Never wash my face same towel. And strictly have a towel for the private's. Two different soaps. Body soap and private's soap. Both Dial and Oil of Olay for the face.
138 2018-03-22 23:44:57 If you had oil and gas reserves on your property, you'd .... ignore it.....

And buy it from Iran?

Hopefully your family would talk some sense into you.

If you import what you have, you are foolish.

Hey don't drill for water.  Go import it.    Brilliant
139 2018-03-22 23:44:54 this seems an over-reaction - Tillerson was not even liked in the oil business, and McMaster was ineffective in his only governance -like position in Afghanistan.   They're all smart guys with limitations and the Trump WH not a place to grow

146 2018-03-22 23:43:54 You might be lucky then! Coconut oil actually can dry out your pores and cause breakouts and can cause your skin to flake! But sounds like it's not done that for you! I reccomend baking soda though!
147 2018-03-22 23:43:54 All so they can Litterally squeeze oil from rock for a couple extra bucks.

155 2018-03-22 23:43:14 Control and regulation are not necessarily the same thing.... there are interesting parallels here with the story of Standard Oil, how the oil & gas industry evolved late 19th/early 20th century and how policy makers grappled with how to contain it...
156 2018-03-22 23:43:12 Where's Mueller @fbi when are arrests happening? Hurry soon before the damn world ends! Not a joke,seriously? Why is Kushner not on lockdown, I mean he helped plan this demise w/Saudi, Syria,China,N Korea,Putin for OIL,$ @justicedems @USINTEL @CREWcrew @GOP Where's Patriotism?
157 2018-03-22 23:43:11 You seem to be saying Scotland produces 100% of it's revenues ..whether only oil and gas revenues OR the total....and because it's population is 8% ..then only gets 8% back?
158 2018-03-22 23:43:02 Hi Bush residents come make relaxing oil things tonight at 7 apt 55!
159 2018-03-22 23:42:58 This doesn't sound good, maybe if you own oil or defense stocks. I have seen this episode before, it's a rerun. Lots of people end up dying.
160 2018-03-22 23:42:55 Go get ‘em! “Patiently Aggressive” was the word of @Team_Onion
161 2018-03-22 23:42:53 Dear @kai_arzheimer, some oil would be great, yours, RRRR
162 2018-03-22 23:42:34 He doesn't have oil
163 2018-03-22 23:42:00 I usually just use coconut oil + it's amazing!!!! My bf also just got me this one called "cannasmack" that's hemp infused and it works sooo nice and smells amazing
164 2018-03-22 23:41:52 So in the end, just like the fall of the Roman Empire into smaller groups of power & just like the dispersion of Rockafellar's Standard Oil into Exxon, Chevron & etc.

165 2018-03-22 23:41:42 Wanted to get a Batman question in there (something to do with a vat of boiling oil) but didn't have space..
166 2018-03-22 23:41:39 @trevortombe also, if a certain PC political party saved a small amount of the profits from $100 oil instead of splurging, the heritage fund may have resembled something more than a second tier ponzy scheme right now, as Norway has shown.
167 2018-03-22 23:41:20 No, us bearded fellows can't hear our ladies wishes because our magnificent beards take time to groom and oil so we are in the bathroom a lot.
168 2018-03-22 23:41:16 aja on season 9 was a mess but some of her issues weren’t exactly her fault, like her skin I believe they’re oil scars and burns but now in and in as3 she is a totally different person and serves look after look definitely a queen I haven’t always liked but grown to love
169 2018-03-22 23:40:54 Now that's the way to do it--- money for nothing and the chicks are FREE !!!!!
170 2018-03-22 23:40:45 Winter put his steak on the skillet first after letting it sit in the seasonings for a bit. The oil sizzled and popped rather loudly when the meat touched the hot metal and she grabbed some tongs to handle the meat. The specialist was humming her jolly little tune again as she--
171 2018-03-22 23:40:43 What are you doing for all the Alberta oil and gas workers who’ve been out of work since 2014??

180 2018-03-22 23:40:07 Gonna try these with avocado  oil. They look good
181 2018-03-22 23:39:53 Interesting thread.
I think SA has every good future here in oil and many creative deals can be done thanks to the genius of Trump, King Salman & MbS. I can't imagine Pres Trump ever letting Rand dictate his knowledge or actions. I'm so happy & excited for all of us. Friends.
182 2018-03-22 23:39:52 Let’s Be Clear: Like initial estimates of an oil spill that triple after a few weeks, don’t be surprised when the number of users illegally mined by Cambridge Analytica triples! #GOPDirtyTricks #gop
183 2018-03-22 23:39:41 I actually hate this oil meme
184 2018-03-22 23:39:33 maybe........ we shouldnt...... turn america devastating other countries and committing mass genocide for the sake of oil into a meme? idk just my sweet onion
185 2018-03-22 23:39:22 Public opinion is against us. We will never get BC residents to support KM unless they see a benefit.  This pussy footing around is going nowhere. @RachelNotley needs to restrict oil to BC now so real ppl will see the effects of reduced oil.
186 2018-03-22 23:39:15 They take hundreds of billions in gold, diamonds & oil and they give us $200 mil in food aid.

Africa is actually the one giving the world economic aid
187 2018-03-22 23:39:05 Sigh.. im happy  about  cannabis so that funding can eventally leading to more cannabis oil reserch for medicinal purpose.. but the part of thats asthmatic who is really senstive to the smell has some concerns. im also  allergic to the plant itself.  #whyme.. #BillC45

192 2018-03-22 23:38:45 That’s the frustration with Ebs deal. No need to trade for cap space until this summer at worst and he’s a 25 G a year guy. $6MM is fair to plus value for Oil. As Nate would say fire Chia
193 2018-03-22 23:38:23 Another thing motivating T is desire 2 ramp up manufacture & sale of arms & weapons of war throughout the world. He seeks 2 stimulate demand 4 brand U.S.A armaments. Makes one yearn for the old days when those in power sought only 2 control and sell oil production. #CNN #MSNBC

198 2018-03-22 23:37:50 Not only do City have minimal support they now have a disgusting support to go with it. So glad we made our money from our history and not oil. Ironic for me to say that but whatever
199 2018-03-22 23:37:35 <3 hope it helps. Jojoba oil is supposed to be chemically similar to the material that makes up fingernails so I think it should help get your dude back to better. <3
200 2018-03-22 23:37:23 @RonJichardson great gig tonight at Cambridge corn exchange. very informative about the perineum oil have taken on board! Although we call it the woompha , cos if it woompha that your balls would be in your ass ?
201 2018-03-22 23:37:12 I miss my little apartment and my oil burner and my books. <3

210 2018-03-22 23:35:50 Got a Bud Red light glass. You Know? The one that lights up when the team you’re watching scores. I’m not sure it’s working. Tried it on Flames game last night...NOTHING! I’ll try Oil game tonight

212 2018-03-22 23:35:33 Turn on my diffuser with lavender oil and read for 10 mins. I try not to look at any type of screen before bed!
213 2018-03-22 23:35:30 Ate too much chili oil and now I’m vibrating.
214 2018-03-22 23:35:20 If launch monitors don’t help. Then why does every tour pro use them to fit for clubs? Are they just snake oil?

216 2018-03-22 23:35:10 She just gon oil up the ass and head to the beach? 
217 2018-03-22 23:34:55 I'm not surprised that you deny easy accessible facts. It is a war crime that foreign troops occupy Iraq, and theft to take 75% of their oil.
218 2018-03-22 23:34:24  that’s a good question b/c if it’s oil..... i have some au naturale Shea butter to put to use.
219 2018-03-22 23:34:22 Asshole much, Brett? Where are you going to be when our coastline is coated in oil? Right there on the front line, or still making smartass comments from afar? Same goes for Rachel. All of this is easy for Albertans to spurt off about. It's NOT your coastline is it?
220 2018-03-22 23:34:22 Oil change, rent, parking tickets,food shopping, loans. Don’t grow up.
221 2018-03-22 23:34:20 damn do some ppl make ramen & only add the seasoning pack? I put at least a spoonful of chili oil, a dash of garlic powder, a little curry powder, a few drips of soy sauce, 2 soft boiled eggs, 4 strips of seaweed, a pinch of fried onions and a handful of crispy pork. Super extra.

225 2018-03-22 23:34:06 Drink lots of water. Can you use coconut oil or Vaseline on it? Or a layer of anti itch cream then the Vaseline. Hope it gets better soon 
226 2018-03-22 23:34:00 Two things:

1) Methane is an excellent transition fuel as an alternative to coal, heavy oil.  So yay Greenies.
2) All the LNG jobs and revenue are in BC, vs. KM in Alberta.
227 2018-03-22 23:33:53 My skin is sooooooo dryyyyyyy, I keep having to top up the coconut oil every 5 mins cos it’s just sinking into my skin
228 2018-03-22 23:33:51 Hello George,  I appreciate your battle against the Erdogan's choices and I agree too, but never be involved in any propagaganda, I think, or boycott policy, it is better for everyone; otherwise you could put oil up the fire
229 2018-03-22 23:33:23 right there with you, mine is due in Nov, every 3 years.  I've getting them since 1992.  They have gotten much better for prep.  Back then, mineral oil, enemas, duclose crazy amount of water, and some cocktail, better to be safe than sorry, lost a work colleague to colon cancer

231 2018-03-22 23:33:21 I don't blame you. I'm 65 the last time I was this scared ,I was 10, listening to my parents at night trying to figure out where to go because of the Oct Missile threats. My dad thought we would be first because of the port of Houston and the oil fields.

234 2018-03-22 23:33:04 Worked at a Fast food restaurant, cleaning the fryer, got called away, and forgot to put the fryer plug back in.  Dumped two gallons of oil all over the cook floor during the dinner rush.

242 2018-03-22 23:31:41 Shameful, yet another NDP governments claim that they are different and will be fiscally responsible. You are fooling no one. There won't be $95 oil and your deficits will only get worse.
243 2018-03-22 23:31:37 Get ready for gas at $6/gallon. That will kill us, but it will be a windfall for Putin’s oil exports.

246 2018-03-22 23:31:11 The headline in the paper? It feels like an issue everyone is up in arms about but doesn’t actually have consequence on day to day life. How about all the years we gave away oil, we could have built infinite infrastructure and had trillions saved.
247 2018-03-22 23:31:01 so dumbass is firing McMaster & calling it mutual. Will he really be able to tolerate that loudmouth Bolton? Might as well get rid of Pruitt, Zinke, Carson, DeVos et al. They're useless or have ben bought out by the oil & gas industry or in DeVos case a rich shrill voice against
248 2018-03-22 23:31:01 North Korea’s foreign ministry is calling the latest United Nations #oil sanctions an “act of war” and “tantamount to a complete economic blockade.”   Well, what is your point!

264 2018-03-22 23:29:26 It's North Dakota and they will tell you it's a bad idea.  North Dakota underwrites their bank with oil and gas.  Jersey doesn't have resources that can underwrite a bank such as that.

279 2018-03-22 23:27:51 Taxes are also how governments enforce high-wages & pensions for themselves, subsidize industries which tax payers may not agree with (oil&gas), pay police to further tax public (tickets) & enforce draconian standards (drug war)& waste without discretion on layers of bureaucracy

289 2018-03-22 23:26:55 CBD oil has no affect on your body like marijuana, so I find it doubtful that Indiana will legalize weed anytime soon. Which sucks, but what can ya do..
290 2018-03-22 23:26:43 Exfoliate regularly. Use an oil. And get Botox. Hahaha.
291 2018-03-22 23:26:13 WHAT KINDA BODY OIL WE TALKING?
292 2018-03-22 23:26:10 A high revving V8 will burn oil normally, Do you let it sit for a while (days, weeks) before starting and running it? Engine bay is super clean Dude, proud of you my man
293 2018-03-22 23:25:57 Indiana legalized CBD oil for all Hoosiers to use as medicine. 
#Indiana #CBDoil #legalizedit
294 2018-03-22 23:25:56 I can tell this is in English and pertains to legal stuff.  Oil and Gas Law is WAAAAY out of my wheelhouse.  I don’t even like to fill up my own car!
295 2018-03-22 23:25:54 Tougher stance, higher oil prices.
296 2018-03-22 23:25:45 Im not ignorant. I dont follow a master. The insurance companies are getting BAILED out for their losses on ACA. He CAN withhild $ for the fasttrack CA train, as well as NY to NJ train. Everyday people are in danger HERE due to Sanctuary and illegals. No safety at home!
297 2018-03-22 23:25:38 Ooops, Armageddon. Get the oil rig drillers ready. And a pinch of Bruce Willis
298 2018-03-22 23:25:35 It does. And I swear, I'm DONE with Girl Scout Cookies-think there was a troop or some gals who tried to revolt & get them to stop using palm oil, but it didn't work, cause I guess there were not enough voices.
299 2018-03-22 23:25:26 They can just play the bone spurs game and dodge the draft 5 times rather than go fight for oil and kill innocent people, Corey. But hey, MAGA, am I right?? 
300 2018-03-22 23:25:02 I'd like to see an end to palm oil use and rampant deforestation caused by this industry
301 2018-03-22 23:24:16 When he said stuff about Iraw being dumb he also said we should take the oil and bomb terrorist's families. If you believed he was more hawkish than Hillary I have a fucking bridge to sell you.
302 2018-03-22 23:24:14 All the politicians are meeting with school kids. Last year they didn't know they were alive. Its ELECTION YEAR.  Lol. They are snake oil salesman
303 2018-03-22 23:24:10 That means a lot Nick. I got my Johnny Slicks Beard oil as well.. Great day!
304 2018-03-22 23:24:09 It even gets the grease off of plastic dishes! Better than Dawn. They should use it on the wildlife after the next oil spill.
305 2018-03-22 23:24:06 Use coconut oil and drink lemon water as much as possible 
306 2018-03-22 23:24:05 Otw to sea oil.

307 2018-03-22 23:23:59 a funny:
Saudi Foreign Minister at the @BrookingsInst today:
"Women have “more” rights- can drive! Can attend sports events! Guardianship system is changing by lowering the limitations. They can wear colors! They have concerts!"
All that oil should have been found under Sweden.
308 2018-03-22 23:23:41 Your mcm’s license plate is his name. His parents got him the car. But that’s ok because he pays for it via gas/oil changes.
309 2018-03-22 23:23:40 Coconut oil is like the answer to all my questions 
310 2018-03-22 23:23:34 Pretty amazing transformation removing oil and replacing with Biomass solar thermal system. Good example of why we get referred by our customers. Amazing job by Ben Melick.
311 2018-03-22 23:23:28 @ryanjespersen I suppose you will have your @NDP cronies on to talk about how great this budget is and how it will save the plant etc etc.  no challenge on the spending (100B in debt, increased taxes...). It apparently relies on a pipeline that doesn’t exist.  Plus they hate oil!
312 2018-03-22 23:23:26 Now everyone knows how British sponsored the northern Nigeria through shell oil company to capture Christians and biafrans ,if Christians/niger delta or diagrams did not want to fight for their rights why not convert your religion and be in peace.
313 2018-03-22 23:23:18 Dads likes that too but has to use Moroccan Oil as that’s what mum likes 
314 2018-03-22 23:23:09 Isn't vanadium the flavour of the month this week for MUS?  I wonder what they will announce next week ..... maybe they'll strike oil

What a disingenuous creep he is selling snake oil
316 2018-03-22 23:22:38 There's so much oil on this pizza u would expect to see a US military base on it
317 2018-03-22 23:22:34 But in reality, I put argon or moroccan oil in the ends of my hair after I get out of the shower. It’s made all the difference.
318 2018-03-22 23:22:26 @AJWVictoriaBC if the green party is about green economy and ndp want to lower the impact such as raising from 5 to 35 a tonne for oil. They should be giving better incentives on electric vehicles like Ontario 15k and exempting pst. Andrew you should fight for this to happen!
319 2018-03-22 23:22:17 Ollie! Roast brussel sprouts tossed with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, walnuts and grapes. She will never leave home again.
320 2018-03-22 23:22:17 $2 billion a year in debt servicing. Instead of praying for the price of oil to increase, pray that interest rates stay low.

336 2018-03-22 23:19:48 LOL coconut oil and your hairline will prosper 
337 2018-03-22 23:19:45 Under Secretary of State – John Bolton said:
The critical oil and natural gas producing region that we fought so many wars to try and protectour economy from the adverse impact of losing that supply or having it available only at very high prices.
338 2018-03-22 23:19:42 The "high road" had an oil slick today... and that's all I'm gonna say about that.
339 2018-03-22 23:19:38 or perhaps we could convince the cons that there some huge profit margin in outer space they could exploit .... some oil or something... convince them to go.... send them freeze dried yummies
340 2018-03-22 23:19:36 Yeah lol, you butter the bread and rip off pieces to dip in the oil. Trust me with the mint tea on the side on a chilly morning. It’s life 
341 2018-03-22 23:19:17 Possibly...but I expect she prefers more whisky with her whisky, with a hint of oil of vitreol and a number of absinthe chasers. That might account for her madness.
342 2018-03-22 23:19:09 Wonder where they got their breeding stock originally? 
Whereas farm animals today have been selectively bred & evolved 2 be domesticated, wild animals have not. In today's world using animal products 4 health reasons is unnecessary & archaic 
Rhino horn, bile farms, emu oil?

345 2018-03-22 23:18:45 Yeah im personally all for its medical uses ive seen what cannbis oil does for people.. not so sure on recreational use..but in orfer for medical to get more funding it needs to be legal.
346 2018-03-22 23:18:33 With China planning to kill the petrodollar(USD) starting this March 26th 2018. As China the biggest importer of oil dropping the dollar for gold to trade against oil. With the "Opec" countries liking the idea..Venezuela would start back trading using gold.

355 2018-03-22 23:16:41 Try looking into nail oil. I use BlissKiss but you want something with jojoba and probably vitamin e. You don’t want to use “hardeners” since that makes nails inflexible and this prone to breaking. The oil helps them stay hydrated and flex.
356 2018-03-22 23:16:36 May I oil your body someday
357 2018-03-22 23:16:34 Don't know, but who cares with all this oil and radiation poison - sounds nonsensical.
358 2018-03-22 23:16:30 You D.C. cartel are heading us down a road with no return. You are nothing but war mongers. Everything you do is war related..we murder innocent people for oil and the 1%.

361 2018-03-22 23:15:50 Hey, anybody on here used CBD oil for chronic pain? Indiana just made it legal (there was a lot of dumb involved, there) and I take too much acetaminophen as it is.
362 2018-03-22 23:15:47 Oil stocks historically pricey relative to oil.
363 2018-03-22 23:15:06 Mcmaster was great, and very tough, but we had some disagreements about how the US should be invading more countries and taking the oil. So he had to go, the very talented bolton will be on the same page as me and we will do great things.... [as long as we are forecasting...]

386 2018-03-22 23:12:08 US military already strapped for pilots. If it goes down, probably a proxy war between Iran and SA. I’d say Iran in that one. Wouldn’t take much to destroy Saudi oil exports.

415 2018-03-22 23:08:02 You mean fix what your party intends to let Oil Companies and Uranium companies destroy in search of more resource to exploit instead of switching to alternatives, then give you and your pals kickbacks? Those parks?
416 2018-03-22 23:07:51 I disagree as I have taken hemp CBD oil. Cannabidiol is one of the key cannabinoids that the body's endocannabinoid system needs. The endocannabinoid system is in the brain, gut and nerve endings  Thc, on the other hand works through receptors in the brain only.
417 2018-03-22 23:07:16  to be fair, I also have an Aveeno 'light sesame oil' in my shower that weirdos my husband out and can totally imagine hum being confused by the overlap of bath and kitchen stuff and wanting to make sure!

426 2018-03-22 23:05:09 Is it just me or are all gaming chairs uncomfortable and practically snake oil sold to us all by streamers? 

I've yet to find one that is comfortable for more than like an hour.
427 2018-03-22 23:05:08 Not many things cause me to literally facepalm. Wow. “I have always been against the war in Iraq” well your new advisor literally wants to go to war with any country containing even the smallest drop of oil. Way to continue to disappoint, keep it up.
428 2018-03-22 23:04:54 Trump really really wants to go to war with Iran.  I think he plans on splitting their oil with Russia.

430 2018-03-22 23:04:38 You need an oil change...
431 2018-03-22 23:04:20 Amazing slaves in Libya! Cheap. Brought to you by Obama & Clinton & neoliberalism. 

But hey, at least the oil in Libya is now controlled by the US, while the rest of Libya is in chaos. Awesome!
432 2018-03-22 23:04:17 I’m no oil painting but fuck me the birds in Clonmel are grim
433 2018-03-22 23:04:10 Rwanda made $621m off exports with a GDP per capita income of $702.84 in 2016- from coffee, tin ore, tea and hides and had an unemployment rate of 16.7% in 2017. Yet Ghana has gold, diamond and cocoa among others, even now, oil and look at where we at! 61yrs  16yrs

435 2018-03-22 23:04:08 Trying to work out your meaning here?
Artist/milk?
Painter/formula?
Pallet/drink?
Oil paint/ breast milk?

Are you broken?
436 2018-03-22 23:04:07 Lucky for you your finger can do it then! Recommend peppermint oil inhalation ( teachers swear by it). Get well soon!

440 2018-03-22 23:03:50 More BS. Pollluting waterways and spewing oil into the Gulf is not the Texas way. Air pollution is not what most Texans want.
441 2018-03-22 23:03:38 Fact is, they are born faster in South Sudan, than you can ever move refugees here. We're trying to solve the wrong problem. Meanwhile China etc make enormous oil revenues from greater Sudan, while creating enormous no's of refugees and we get to deal with people they won't take.

455 2018-03-22 23:02:01 That'll happen running a province on oil revenue for 40 years, it drops and so does the provincial income, we need a PST.
456 2018-03-22 23:01:42 Using Christian leaders using proxy-Hindu names India's land occupied new islamic states have been created by forced occupation!

458 2018-03-22 23:01:37 Trump literally campaigned on sending in the military to "take their oil". I don't think many people thought of Trump as anti-interventionist

475 2018-03-22 23:00:06 The legislators writing the AWB's know nothing about firearms though. I bought my old WASR during the first AWB, and bought my newer AK pattern rifle after the SAFE act was passed. Opposing ineffective legislation seems like a winning strategy to me.
476 2018-03-22 23:00:04 If I thought the oil companies really were ok with employment competition, I would go along.

486 2018-03-22 22:58:39 Im in #Alaska so far, our population is on the decline, our schools are in the bottom 10. We have a GOP controlled #akleg that is in the pockets for Big Oil. We are in a recession that seems to have no end on the horizon.
487 2018-03-22 22:58:31 Well, yes... been relying on that method for a couple of decades.  
Must inform @Tucker5law that brushing them with oil before bombardment in the Mitsubishi is a bit less messy than deep frying.
488 2018-03-22 22:58:29 If S Korea had Canada's oil, no oil would leave SK unprocessed. It would be sold as manufactured export product.Doesnt NAFTA prevent the sale of BC water in winter when its plentiful? 
@VanCourierNews
489 2018-03-22 22:58:16 Cal is so full of shit. First he was whining about being in a tough bracket so far away from Lexington. And he talmbout don’t drink the poison of a easy path to the final four. If you don’t git’cho Lucas Oil head ass on somewhere.

491 2018-03-22 22:57:55 this picture just told me shut up and go oil my scalp . so guess what i just did ? oil my scalp
492 2018-03-22 22:57:53 An oil tycoon was qualified to be the Secretary of State?
A man with zero experience in macroeconomic policy is qualified to be secretary of treasurer?
A billionaire repub donor lacking even basic knowledge in the subject is fit to be head of education?
493 2018-03-22 22:57:37 Putin's orders. Iran has oil reserves.
494 2018-03-22 22:57:19 Extra virgin olive oil is the best moisturizer for your face. Thank me later.

496 2018-03-22 22:57:07 Natural Beauty Tip for Grey Hair:- 

Take 250 grams of mustard oil and boil it with 60 grams of henna leaves, till it entirely burns in the mustard oil. 

Apply this infusion in your hair to get black and shiny hair.
497 2018-03-22 22:57:06 La Planta de san Lorenzo de OIL Combustible ya no tiene mantenimiento.
Solo 100 empleados que Cristobal, no les paga esta trabajando , solo para que no haya un desaste. YPF esta interviniendo para que nada suceda.
Y  Cristobal se da el lujo de salir en los medios.
498 2018-03-22 22:56:52 Just got out of the shower and I smell like rose oil :3
499 2018-03-22 22:56:34 Does the actual tan mousse smell like the oil?!
500 2018-03-22 22:56:21 hes gonna be on the oil rigs before that happens bro
501 2018-03-22 22:56:21 Also, I give it 6 months. Bolton and Trump will be oil and water.
502 2018-03-22 22:55:56 CBD oil is the best for seizure. Your body can get addicted to any substance. Once your body gets accustomed to it you will see that cannabis put all cancers, strokes, seizures, and migrains into a state of remission. You don't have to smoke it to get the effects of it.
503 2018-03-22 22:55:41 I would try a charcoal based body scrub or wash, I see them cheap at Marshals & TJ Maxx, and Tea Tree oil or tea tree based products are also good for drying up acne in a more gentle way than salicylic acid
504 2018-03-22 22:55:33 الله يسعدك اول مره اسمعها
505 2018-03-22 22:55:02 I don’t mind at all if people want to live that way. Just don’t force me to live like that. Invest in new sustainable energy technology and the like.  Oil and coal are dying.  China is leaving the U. S. behind. Manufacturing is for third world countries.
506 2018-03-22 22:55:02 عجبتني الفكره ... انزل عشان راي ميتزورش 
507 2018-03-22 22:54:48 Of course they are. We are draining our aquifers and sucking resources out of the ground as fast as possible. Oil companies knew this was a risk hazard back in the 80s. But who cares as long as there is a buck to be made.
508 2018-03-22 22:54:48 My car smells like Publix fried chicken.

It’s invigorating tbh.
They should make this scent in febreeze spray. Wallflowers maybe. Maybe they’ll give me a cup of the oil they fried it in and I can just put it in a aroma diffuser
509 2018-03-22 22:54:46 I need some more Jamaican castor oil for my braids
510 2018-03-22 22:54:44 Natural Beauty Tip for Grey Hair:- 

Mix equal amount of almond oil, lemon juice, and amla juice.

Massage your hair with this mixture to cure the problem of grey hair.
511 2018-03-22 22:54:38 OH - NO! If you stop burning oil and gas in Europe my own personal $50bil will have to pay for army / police wages instead of the broke state we robbed... [reasons to embrace Renewables Part #86]

513 2018-03-22 22:53:53 It's a shame she can't find pants without rips...
Or hair..
514 2018-03-22 22:53:50 And she has spent so much money on her looks too. Davina is no oil painting once you take the make-up off, plus her being so horrible makes a person ugly
515 2018-03-22 22:53:49 Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.
516 2018-03-22 22:53:44 why ban diesel not petrol, both are from oil... but not tobacco thats proven to kill?
Why do I think its petrol thats the killer? 
Vaccines kill, pharma kills tens of thousands but Govt wants to ban diesel. Why?
517 2018-03-22 22:53:42 TrumPeter wants the oil and Russia now sells oil. One less competitor. #BoltonRussia
518 2018-03-22 22:53:41 Understood, but I think it's a losing strategy and I'll have no sympathy for you when the AWB is written in a way you hate, and when the other big corps make it harder for you to play with your toys.
519 2018-03-22 22:53:38 They never learn.  Needle stuck on oil rather than diversifying #economy.  The market ups and downs will forever have Alberta on a fiscal roller coaster. #abpoli #ableg #cdnpoli #fossilfuels #economicdevelopment #Oil
520 2018-03-22 22:53:35 "How can we be trade partners if we can't even be friends?" 
"I wanna be your oil provider."
521 2018-03-22 22:52:38 Both oil and SPX are inflated in my opinion, so medium-term both go down, but short-term they may not move together.
522 2018-03-22 22:52:30 Mkt is in a stupor about OIL with Bolton. Bought it at 64.17
523 2018-03-22 22:52:07 @todonoticias interesante ver que oil cuide que no se produzca un incendio por los combustibles en los tanques y ustedes lo vuelen con drones... si se cae que ocurre?
524 2018-03-22 22:52:00 Something something ISIS, something something FREEDOM, something something NATIONAL SECURITY, something something OIL, something something  AMURICA!
525 2018-03-22 22:52:00 me: Character drives plot, character drives plot...

Also me: But wouldn't it be cool if that oil tanker exploded?
526 2018-03-22 22:51:59 Natural Beauty Tip for Grey Hair:- 

Boil ribbed gourd in coconut oil till it turns black for 3-4 hours.

Massaging the scalp with this oil cures premature greying of hair.
527 2018-03-22 22:51:52 Anyone know a good place to get an oil change?
528 2018-03-22 22:51:43 Have you tried Olbas oil?
529 2018-03-22 22:51:38 Patchouli + Ylang Ylang + Tea Tree + Lavender + Frankincense + V6 Oil = Face Serum
530 2018-03-22 22:51:35 [food] me: pours oil into non-stick pan
egg: ooh i will glue myself to the bottom of this pan
531 2018-03-22 22:51:19 I just used the oil and I want to eat myself
532 2018-03-22 22:51:03 No, I won't be "fixing" anything, because nothing's broken. In fact, I'll do everything in my power to oppose any further bargaining away of my rights in exchange for a false sense of security. Vague threats and "powerful allies" won't deter me.
533 2018-03-22 22:50:56 Okay they raise the taxes on cigarettes, gasoline & oil. It all boils down that we the tax payers will pay for it, even the  teachers. The raise they get will push them into a higher tax bracket so tell me what have we gained?
534 2018-03-22 22:50:53 Amazing how people have this depiction of greedy oilmen when, from my experience, oil execs pale in comparison to government officials.
535 2018-03-22 22:50:51 What a joke!!!  Who is allowing all this shit?  Putin found oil?  Everyone wants a % ?
536 2018-03-22 22:50:43 Hahaha!
537 2018-03-22 22:50:40 i feel like sniffing my peppermint essential oil is the equivalent to the high to snorting cocaine
538 2018-03-22 22:50:35 If the Oil won the 2nd/3rd lottery, would you prefer taking F Svechnikov or Zadina, or trading down to 4-7 for a D, say Boqvist?
539 2018-03-22 22:50:34 In the late 90’s, the neocons begged President Clinton to review their plans to invade Iraq and plant a “democracy” seed, and get their oil. There plan was subsequently used by W. Bush. They were Bolton, Abrams, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Kristol, and others. War is their standard.
540 2018-03-22 22:50:33 My grandma did this with all of her kids. If they got sick she made them a hot toddy or hot blackberry brandy. If that didnt work she pumped you full of castor oil. Dad always said he dreaded the castor oil
541 2018-03-22 22:50:29 Would you pay for Turkish oil wrestling? That shits the move
542 2018-03-22 22:50:26 When in doubt, coconut oil. #MillennialAQuote
543 2018-03-22 22:50:24 Boutta spend 130 on an oil change
544 2018-03-22 22:50:20 Just realized humans are more pathetic socially than oil and water

It is impossible for oil and water to mix, and even then, they're still able to coexist.
545 2018-03-22 22:50:04 Yes, they're the reason why the oil companies even still exist. Otherwise they would have already been demolished by solar energy. But that's what happens when corporations are allowed to run wild. They capture government to serve their greed.
546 2018-03-22 22:50:03 You do realize that half the things named above were also done by the previous Consevative government? Huge debt, supporting 3rd world countries. The jobs issue is an oil price issue, that is not something or anyone can fix with a snap of their fingers.
547 2018-03-22 22:49:49 nothing more beautiful than chaos in the gov't, less oil in the cogs
548 2018-03-22 22:49:47 ベリアル幼稚園今日で閉園しちゃう
549 2018-03-22 22:49:47 But... MBJ has value when he isn’t covered in oil... MBJ can actually act.

551 2018-03-22 22:49:40 This gaggle of grandmas just left Columbus botanical with their new cbd oil pens screaming “woohoo!!!!” And it was adorable.
552 2018-03-22 22:49:36 Crude oil accounts for 95% of Nigeria's foreign exports.
553 2018-03-22 22:49:23 60% of my skin: dry, flakey, irritated 

my T zone: so greasy, so much oil -America has its eyes on her
554 2018-03-22 22:49:06 Made a VERY rookie mistake only applying sun tan oil and not lotion at the pool today ... let's just say I'm a little on the burnt side 
555 2018-03-22 22:48:55 New, white canvas sneakers, some strange assortment of hair alchemy (at least three containers and weird oil dropper of some kind), new socks. A poncho. Heart-shaped sunglasses. And bags and bags of snacks that make me wonder if she is just going to hole up somewhere in the park.
556 2018-03-22 22:48:53 Oil is SAVING our planet actually. It's allowing 8B+ people to eat & lift themselves out of poverty. There are FAR MORE benefits to cheap energy than downsides. 2-3 degrees more in 100 years, maybe, who the F cares? Bs now out pf poverty, but want what we have. Deny it to them?
557 2018-03-22 22:48:36 Our country is big enough that we’ll always have states with drought and states with flooding.  Why can’t we redistribute water and pump it around the country like we do with oil?  I’d pay more taxes to see that happen.

560 2018-03-22 22:47:45 Natural Beauty Tip for Grey Hair:- 

Boil some curry leaves in coconut oil till it turns black.

Apply this on your scalp as a hair tonic for treating the problems of hair loss and pigmentation.
561 2018-03-22 22:47:39 It sounds like you have high porosity because I have low porosity so I get build up fast. My hair doesn’t like coconut oil very much. My hair likes castor oil and olive oil

Massage coconut oil and lemon juice on the scalp to get black and shiny hair.
565 2018-03-22 22:47:04 I guess a giant oil leak and stuff
566 2018-03-22 22:47:04 - Trump to Jared: this is a very Good Cow the better i've ever seen so far. Come on the Dob Dashir let the milk or the oil get down. #cashcow

Any offline tips from now til 7:30 CT count toward the goal of top off - 1111 is the start point.
568 2018-03-22 22:46:58 Palm oil KILLS wildlife every where it is harvested. If you use it or products that have it in them you are the problem
569 2018-03-22 22:46:51 So... 

We are hunting for oil or natural gas? 
570 2018-03-22 22:46:45 Flip-side of the Texan ill-regulated oil economy.

Boil some pieces of amla in coconut oil till it turns black and massage your hair with it to cure your grey hair, naturally.
575 2018-03-22 22:45:29 I am absolutely COVERED in oil from tonight's show - thank you again for being so incredible, I have so much fun on cam I will be live again on Saturday night, can't wait to see you again then x
576 2018-03-22 22:45:25 Please try the semi-horrific chili. But also ask for packets of their chili hot sauce. It’s more like a hot pepper and cumin infused oil, but it’s the best part of this deal.
577 2018-03-22 22:45:20 Not if the US government funds out that sebaceous glands produce oil
578 2018-03-22 22:45:15 Driving into those oil change places with the big ass hold in the middle is always so sketch
579 2018-03-22 22:45:04 this oil meme shouldnt be funny but gdi it makes me laugh everytime
580 2018-03-22 22:44:58 I did the test at the weekend &result was low porosity. I don't get it though - my hair dries fast & I don't get build up. Also tends to look dull & dry, tangles easily & loves shea butter. I heard coconut oil is heavy but it did nothing for me when I tried it. So I dunno
581 2018-03-22 22:44:44 How do dey operate
582 2018-03-22 22:44:39 I understand that rifles aren't used in many crimes, still the assault weapon crimes are a national disgrace. Regardless of what I think, powerful other ppl agree with me and you're gonna lose soon. Fix the problem on your terms or somebody else will fix it on their terms.
583 2018-03-22 22:44:39 we need a premier with balls that can get things done like the oil sands pipeline that needs to travel though British Columbia. #abbudget The only thing Notley has achieved is the minimum wage.
584 2018-03-22 22:44:29 I just left Everything there I only eat one wing. I took the 8 pc out so you can see all the nasty oil.

586 2018-03-22 22:44:24 For eg. The oil spill cost BP 61billion and I don't think we would have seen that settlement without government getting in the mix

Same with the billion dollar settlements for the banks for the financial crisis.

594 2018-03-22 22:43:59 That would be against the law you seem so concerned about other people violating and would benefit those American funders trying to prop up the American oil industry.

602 2018-03-22 22:43:18 Why subject pipelines to emission targets but not producers of ships, cars or airplanes that USE oil ? Bias against W-Canada to benefit E-Canada ? @jkenney @JustinTrudeau #abpoli

1-Quadruple the Carbon Tax.

4-Defeat the NDP.

608 2018-03-22 22:42:21 Exactly. I was trying to be slightly funny but im sure more animals are harmed by oil and oil spills and our addiction to fossil fuels than any windmills.
609 2018-03-22 22:42:18 that’s why you use oil instead and like one or two drops only. not no damn blunt or a fucking joint

612 2018-03-22 22:41:38 I usually do not care about #abbudget but the fact that there is a heavy dependence on oil pipelines is very upsetting and angers me. We should be doing the opposite for our province and environment and depend on less oil, fossil fuels, and focus on renewable energy.

617 2018-03-22 22:41:07 We shouldn’t be subsidizing oil and gas but far better than having the BC Liberals in power so all good.

633 2018-03-22 22:40:11 Its a hot one out in the oil patch today. especially to be working in Malaga. It gets hot over here. The heat is just barely getting started. I need a beer
634 2018-03-22 22:39:57 You can look into CBD oil.  It is cannabinol which is also from the hemp plant but doesn’t affect your mind.  It is legal.  No THC that can make you feel high.
635 2018-03-22 22:39:44 We made banana oil in lab today and it was so cool. Ugh i love chem so much 
636 2018-03-22 22:39:40 Such an important piece of information. Albertans continue to falsely believe that our resource revenue will always be there. Until we pay our bills with revenue we control, we will forever be beholden to the oil price rollercoaster.
637 2018-03-22 22:39:38 I've never heard that (only sheep we have don't need shearing), but it's plausible. It's pretty easy to pair orphaned lambs/calves with new mothers if you rub eucalyptus oil on the muzzle of both. So maybe the lanolin in the wool is a key way for lambs to recognise their mums.
638 2018-03-22 22:39:38 Looking good
639 2018-03-22 22:39:37 There is, TerraVia are already producing algal substitute commercially and Unilever were buying large quantities for use in cleaning products but they also make food grade oil. Bristol university working hard on fungal substitute too. Although I fear it will be too late

655 2018-03-22 22:36:47 You can also try Tea Tree Oil if the Peppermint hasn't helped. A few drops with a tablespoon of olive oil. Warm slightly and then use a dropper to put a few drops into your ear.

(No point in drawing conclusions at a well that's about to be worked over.)

699 2018-03-22 22:30:48 Common kitchen plumbing problems occur due to backup. Grease, cooking oil, and other fats can gunk up your pipes. Use a strainer to catch items and keep them clean. Periodically flush the drain with a few gallons of boiling water to melt away accumulated grease and soap.
700 2018-03-22 22:30:46 Well then you could encourage the NRA to join the discussion on an AWB or watch it be enacted w/out any input while corporations start limiting your "rights" bc you pretend that AR-style weapons aren't a problem.

703 2018-03-22 22:30:42 That's not my point though. :) 
I think I'm trying to say that Nigeria's revenues comes from oil due to their over-reliance on it. Perhaps, they should start thinking about the future when their oil is not needed anymore in the West, which would encourage them to start doing 1/
704 2018-03-22 22:30:32 Absolutely correct! Olive oil enhances the absorption of all carotenoids.

718 2018-03-22 22:29:50 Are you using Palm Oil?
719 2018-03-22 22:28:57 How is farming Emus for their oil for it's health benefits any different from poaching rhino for it's horn?
Even if it does work, surely there are other alternatives that don't involve using animal parts?
Why should animals have to die to cure humans?

720 2018-03-22 22:28:48 Please cut the crappalolla...yuan /oil futes is the equivalent of firing an economic nuke... and china was going to do it anyway...so lets stop blaming Trump shall we?
721 2018-03-22 22:28:44 OIL UP!!!
722 2018-03-22 22:28:42 Yep, oil in the water doesn't keep pasta together. 

Oil after draining will prevent sauce from sticking. 

The only thing oil in boiling water will do is keep it from boiling over. 

Though butter used in an oil based sauce will help the sauce emulsify.
723 2018-03-22 22:28:41 Do some research. Who are they? Who do they fight with? Where do they get their funding from? What do local testimonies say? You know, it's called journalism Oh, &while we're on that subject, Who's illegally occupying Syria's Golan Heights? & Guess what? Oil has been found.
724 2018-03-22 22:28:35 Henry kissinger signed a deal prioritising oil for Israel over USA in the event of a shortage many years ago.. And Obama increased the aid to Israel hugely..USA/UK are controlled/owned by them.. All part of the plan #tailwaggingthedog

726 2018-03-22 22:28:16 Dear oil companies, we know you are lying, GFY’s.
727 2018-03-22 22:28:15 I'm about to  jojoba oil tf out myself, like I need the home spa day treatment.
728 2018-03-22 22:28:01 I've been using coconut oil to cook. That sounds lovely 
729 2018-03-22 22:27:47 Actually not a bad question—that “blend” is probably half canola oil!
730 2018-03-22 22:27:34 Who blocked you?
731 2018-03-22 22:27:26 I appreciate when I get my oil changed and they ask for my number so that they can not call me when my car is done.
732 2018-03-22 22:27:17 Pollution is awful. Economically speaking, we should stop using plastics because of the amount of crude oil required to make plastic.
733 2018-03-22 22:27:11 You can mix oil and water........
You just have to spin the shit out of it, at like 21trillion RPM’s

740 2018-03-22 22:25:30 @nthompsonEE any way you could find and publish the amount of money petroleum interests have invested in "Oil" Sears election campaigns?  Also, any trips he's been on at the expense of those interests would be illuminating for Bartlesville's citizens.

752 2018-03-22 22:24:41 ...it’s wood oil. I totally knew that.
753 2018-03-22 22:24:36 Also untrue. Standard oil benefitted massively from the tarriffs that marked the age. Also they got their oil via american military intervention in places like China
754 2018-03-22 22:24:09 When I did the oil drop experiment as an undergrad I had a sign wrong on one of the velocities and calculated a 1/3 e charge on my drop the first time around. Got very excited about having found a bare quark for a few minutes there. 
755 2018-03-22 22:24:06 OIL CHANGES ARE EXPENSIVE ! I literally just want to give this car back yo. It’s def time to relocate to a big city so I won’t need a car.
756 2018-03-22 22:23:55 Bet  we out, tryna get in on this oil money
757 2018-03-22 22:23:48 apparently NY only #mmj state that regulates/sets pricing of #patient products like they do a utility. @EtainLLC a disp charges $225/gram for vape oil pre-fill cart. CBD or THC $ r the same #mmj in NYS has been a disaster and this is further evidence @MMPconnect @SafeAccess 
758 2018-03-22 22:23:37 So not only is palm oil production killing orang utans via habitat loss, it’s also doing this?

760 2018-03-22 22:23:28 @WhiteHouse  What a bunch of BS. All the Donald wants is his Damn Border Wall. He is out for himself, the NRA, Gas & Oil companies and every racist group who supports him financially.
761 2018-03-22 22:23:27 Amen 
762 2018-03-22 22:23:25 Yeah. Castor oil is brilliant for your hair. Loads of expensive lash serums have castor oil. I use rosemary and lavender essential oils too as they are meant to stimulate the hair folicles. Rub a bit of the base of my lashes and brush it through
763 2018-03-22 22:22:30 They haven't sold Iraqi Kurdistan to Israel Barzani sells oil to Greece Turkey Iran Israel Cyprus etc it stays mutual they don't rely on one solid country. Each country has its own wants. Turkey is anti Kurdistan but still buys oil from Barzani. Iran too but doesn't support them
764 2018-03-22 22:21:58 @Featherbeard hey dude, what do you know about beard oil and wax? Been growing my beard and mustache out and not it’s kinda getting in the way. What should I do or get? I figure you’d know.
765 2018-03-22 22:21:57 Thanks so much. I found a Whole Foods and stocked up on hard boiled eggs, #nsng salami and cheese packs, raw coconut butter, avocados and macadamia nuts. Pro-tip: the deli will make any sandwich you want into a lettuce wrap and will even use avocado oil mayo.
766 2018-03-22 22:21:56 And that's without considering any of the fundamental differences between the Alberta and Norwegian oil industries and the resulting differences in affordable royalty rates, nor the differences between their sovereign vs our sub-sovereign jurisdiction.
767 2018-03-22 22:21:54 It cracks me up when mechanic shops try to screw me over. My dad taught me how to change my own oil, change my own brakes, replace my rotors & holds me accountable for making sure everything is taken care of. I know my car like the back of my hand. Sir, bye.
768 2018-03-22 22:21:42 Can’t get over that there’s a hip craft beer restaurant in the building that had an oil furnace showroom and a 10 cent Coke machine when I was a kid

Tell me, what day do you think Putin wants Iranian gas and oil piped across Syria to cut into Russian market share?
771 2018-03-22 22:21:33 Buhari has only Northern interests at heart. Look at all the investments of our tax money into a mad search for oil in the chad basin and all the moves to construct a railway from the North to Niger republic. Now this!
772 2018-03-22 22:21:15 Looked at my phone while at work to see I had 3 missed calls from my mom so I call back assuming something's wrong. She answers yelling "Guess what son?! I just bought some CBD oil!" 3 years ago she was drug testing me every week.. think she's finally coming around
773 2018-03-22 22:21:13 I got older. Stopped plucking them to death. Used castor oil. And now I brush them with brow gel

777 2018-03-22 22:20:46 do you use it straight from the package or do you drop an oil on it to make it creamier?

787 2018-03-22 22:19:20 Of that 61%, how much is exported as rUK Exports (whisky, gin, avionics)

How much would continue as rUK needs the imports (food, power, water, oil, gas)  

NI export 59% of their Export are to rUK, but WM seems fine to put a border in the Irish Sea. Is Scotland a special case?
788 2018-03-22 22:19:17 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.

794 2018-03-22 22:18:07 I too am very concerned about Alberta’s current and projected debt.  I’m also angry about the substantial debt the former PC Gov’t. saddled NDP with. The PCs had 40 consecutive years of high oil royalty earnings and left with a deficit. That’s not acceptable!

802 2018-03-22 22:16:21 oh please. such an immature childish oil argument.
803 2018-03-22 22:16:18 Try and add a little bit of oil (preferably olive), helped me a lot, and try to have your hands as water-free and warm as possible!
804 2018-03-22 22:16:00 Well the BC NDP want good, working class jobs in BC. LNG would do that. Also, if an LNG pipeline bursts, no real mess on the ground. I honestly think the discussion on oil on the coast would be way different if we were going to ship crude oil not bitumen.
805 2018-03-22 22:15:57 Has anyone looked into the secret loan made by Russia so that a U.N.-named person could buy 7% of a Russian controlled oil company??

834 2018-03-22 22:11:46 There is a way to respect the environment and having the pipeline...We cannot stop progress or there wouldn't be any cities..There is always risk in everything but we need the pipeline..lets do it in respect with the nature...But remember the oil is coming from the soil...

857 2018-03-22 22:08:26 I read somewhere that tea tree oil burned in diffusers are toxic for dogs. People should be aware if its true.

859 2018-03-22 22:08:21 Lady taps me on the shoulder in line at the hardware store. “Excuse me sir, but do you know if this motor oil is this the right kind for a lawn mower?” 

Me: “lawn mowers need oil? Oops.”

864 2018-03-22 22:07:36 Lol Huxley is expensive af it work it. I actually prefer cosrx aha/bha toner than Huxley’s. Huxley has great essence, mousturizer & oil though. It didn’t break me out & actually minimized acne scarring over 3months. Those cosrx pimple patches are LIFE!
865 2018-03-22 22:07:35 try using coconut oil but only put it on your chest and don’t use it anywhere else. i used that on my face cause it wasn’t tanning and worked well without burning!
866 2018-03-22 22:07:34 why are y'all putting shit like butter, turmeric n' magic oil in your coffee? thas nasty.
867 2018-03-22 22:07:07 Rick Simpson experienced magic when he decided to use topical activated cannabis oil to treat his skin cancer in the late 90’s & cultivated RSO (Rick Simpson oil) to help others after that, but was only persecuted later in Canada because his doctors refused to see the benefits
868 2018-03-22 22:07:07 Oh yeah I seen this, palm oil or something?
869 2018-03-22 22:07:07 I'm putting an AR15 together with my buddy, buying a Sig P226 Legion, taking my wife to learn the basics on her Glock 19 Gen 4.5 which will be her gun once she gets her LTC.

871 2018-03-22 22:06:35 there's no coal left. A bunch of hoopla over a lost industrial necessity. I figured the truth of it when strip mining took off as like totally good... of which it wasn't/isn't. Deepmine and hard coal is pretty much over now. Oil is the same, but more of it, not on the us mainland
872 2018-03-22 22:06:27 This is the good thing about no zoning in downtown. Every corner is a potential oil field!

876 2018-03-22 22:05:33 My deer rifle is semi-automatic, with a detachable box magazine, in .30-06. If I put a pistol grip on it, it would qualify as an "assault weapon". If the only difference is ergonomics and not function, they are normal rifles.
877 2018-03-22 22:05:31 Thanks for surfacing this. The "snake oil" meme re: Cambridge really got into the discourse, didn't it? Snake oil or not, their Mercer money is green — and I doubt Simpson would turn it down if conditions were right. Don't know about Steele.
878 2018-03-22 22:05:13 @ImanAbdulRahim halu! Sorry if this has been asked before, but tea tree oil or salicylic acid better for big angry acne? Hehe thanksies!!! 
879 2018-03-22 22:05:08 Even if Nigeria produces 100m barrels of crude oil per day, it still won’t make the life of the average Nigerian any better... not with this sets of thieves and looters we have as leaders!!!

884 2018-03-22 22:04:32 Do you think the China oil contract will give gold a long term boost? Maybe why it’s holding?
885 2018-03-22 22:04:30 Humans are at the top of nature.. We can help nature and nature helps us... Trees !! 

The trust about oil needs to be now ... Not only dus I produce Al kinds of camicols in the air that harm everything alive. (Nature is alive.)

It's not neede go green from the start !
886 2018-03-22 22:04:20 a month's worth of research, site visits, and fretting is about to pay off: i am switching from oil to heat my home to sustainable wood pellets! super excited and nervous. i'll be cataloging the whole installation on my blog if you're into that sort of thing.
887 2018-03-22 22:04:17 At least your face will be bright and smooth fo ever!! Excess oil on the skin can make pores more prominent and stand out more though which might be your problem  maybe also use something with retinoids/retinol/vitamin A!!
888 2018-03-22 22:04:12 Ironically, snake oil is actually healthy and beneficial, but most of the "snake oil" sold back in the Old Days was just concoctions of random liquids.
889 2018-03-22 22:04:11 I’ve realised my “go to” 10 minute meal is always some kind of fried gnocchi dish with a strong cheese, variety of pork (pancetta, prosciutto), garlic, spinach and truffle oil... such a visionary in the kitchen 
890 2018-03-22 22:04:09 No the NRA did not ban guns at the convention. 
891 2018-03-22 22:04:04 Wouldn't that mean also a change in the world order and somehow a "victory " for countries like Vzla, Russia & co?... just asking. 
Still finding hard to grasp how CNY oil contract will do that (FX - BoPs fundamentals) any help appreciate it.
892 2018-03-22 22:03:52 Take precaution
893 2018-03-22 22:03:47 Any oil charts sir?
894 2018-03-22 22:03:39 haha, electricity generation is not the same as oil extraction. We extract and export plenty of oil and gas from the North West Shelf of Australia. I'm not quite sure what your point is?
895 2018-03-22 22:03:32 Rather Pluck My Eyes and pour ghost pepper oil in my eyes!
896 2018-03-22 22:03:31 I think the lack of oil pressure might have something to do with that stopped engine....

(Don't we all!!????)
899 2018-03-22 22:03:13 That's the same wrong meme.  Are you having a seizure?  Do you need someone to call for help?
900 2018-03-22 22:03:10 It’s too bad there’s no oil in space because you know darn tooting the US would yeehaw tf out into that bitch
901 2018-03-22 22:03:08 Oh blimey, I went to an 'immersive' theatre production! It involved me being walked around the block by a gangster, pushed into a meat locker, rubbing baby oil onto a topless (male!) boxer and helping to remove a corpse from under a snooker table. It was fabulous!

909 2018-03-22 22:02:33 Humans evolve.   Amazing isn't it.    We once just walked, then used animals to travel, then we discovered oil etc

We already have alternative energy sources.   Wind, solar, electric, geothermal.

Time to evolve to a new energy source.   Oil is killing our planet.

936 2018-03-22 21:59:11 There is a limit our environment can stand and coal and oil move us to the limit too quickly

957 2018-03-22 21:55:57 I have also had pretty bad acne since I was a teen! It looks like you use a lot of moisturizing products, which might add to your skin being oily if they all contain other oils! I would suggest using an oil free moisturizer and an oil free spf!

966 2018-03-22 21:54:28 Yeah, George Bush and Tony Blair also said that it was "highly likely" that Iraq had WMD's (nukes), we invaded, stole their oil and left the place in utter chaos. Surprise! It was false! 

People have become so detached from reality that it is honestly embarrassing.

979 2018-03-22 21:53:17 By moving dilbit and other heavy oil onto the expansion, that opens space for light crude and refined products AND allows a higher flow rate than is otherwise possible. Only "expert" who thinks it'll increase prices is Robyn Allan and her extremely narrow analysis

981 2018-03-22 21:53:01 You have to inspect it in Missouri before you can tag it. Any place that changes oil can inspect it, but it takes forever for them to check it out. Then of course the license office is slower than death.

990 2018-03-22 21:51:43 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr I'm assuming the green orders on USO means someone is buying? Thank you for catching that!
991 2018-03-22 21:51:38 We need both. Tourism pays low wages. Oil & gas pays very high wages & taxes. Oil & gas industry merely produces what customers demand.  Since you eat, heat your home or use a bus, ferry or car you use oil or gas. The bread doesn’t grow itself nor arrives without oil in the shop.
992 2018-03-22 21:51:32 Good to know. I literally have never tried deep frying anything. My clutsy ass doesn’t need to be near hot oil

997 2018-03-22 21:50:38 Actually I agree with you..   We need to unlink our whole economy to be primarily on oil taxes..  or even wind tax..   but it seems that with our low tax state, we don't have anything to work with..  what is your suggestion??
998 2018-03-22 21:50:38 Hydro has issues we can largely overcome, unlike coal and oil.

Shifting demand here would be a step in the right direction. Not a stopping point, but a point in the right direction.
999 2018-03-22 21:50:37 Progressive ideas should cause the market to drop. Whether it’s gauging pharma or oil subsidies, anything that cuts profits, even for good, must entail a market drop.

1002 2018-03-22 21:50:20 So rUK won't be wanting our oil, energy, water and finest food & drink? Fair enough, I'm sure there'll be plenty takers elsewhere.
1003 2018-03-22 21:50:10 I'm doing both.  Hitting the show for a case of ammo and then off to the range.

1005 2018-03-22 21:49:40 The idea of a holiday is to get away from all this. Just enjoy yourself, relax, and forget the Internet.
1006 2018-03-22 21:49:39 Palm oil? Weird. Do we know where it came from (I mean, other than palms, obvs!) Spill presumably?
1007 2018-03-22 21:49:35 Meanwhile... National Park Lands are being sold to oil & gas companies, and the highest bidders are winning entire acres of protected lands for less than NYC renters pay per square foot.
1008 2018-03-22 21:49:21 Asariotis: fewer oil spills and smaller amounts of oil spilled by tankers b/c of int’l laws. Regulation v. effective in this case.  Public demand for these refs easier to achieve b/c effects of oil spills are obvious. (Not so easy w/ climate change)
1009 2018-03-22 21:49:18 The highest tax cuts in over 50 year -highest rate of employment -especially for minorities - stock market strong and a much stronger economy overall- and many companies coming back to America creating more jobs - America will be selling oil soon instead of importing it -  #MAGA!

1012 2018-03-22 21:49:01 I got an oil change 5 weeks ago and I’m already at the recommended mileage to get another change... like how?
1013 2018-03-22 21:48:59 20 Bands I’d oil yo mammy down
1014 2018-03-22 21:48:51 .@PEPANZ1 makes the economic and environmental case for continued oil and gas activity in NZ, even in a carbon-constrained world. With demand increasing, it makes sense to do it responsibly in NZ and to gain the economic benefits, and price the carbon to internalise CC impacts.
1015 2018-03-22 21:48:41 Are u advocating sustainable palm oil or boycotting palm oil? Your messages seem misleading the ignorant to their doom.
1016 2018-03-22 21:48:32 Just watch out for the oil spats on that rump. 
1017 2018-03-22 21:48:29 Aunty Ji. Gee sounds like Ghee which a kind of oil one uses for paratha cookin.
1018 2018-03-22 21:48:06 Chalo, kisi ko toh samajh aaya. But it's not just FB, it's basically every goddamn app that asks fr too many "permissions".

1028 2018-03-22 21:46:42 Couldn’t agree more!!  Throwing my support behind the Jets... and then anyone playing the Leafs
1029 2018-03-22 21:46:35 the transmission from the markets to the real economy is much lower than people often assume  - see 2016 when everyone was calling for a recession based on falling oil and SP drop.  real economy tends to be a lot more stable than mkts.
1030 2018-03-22 21:46:25 Game over. The man with brown skin and oil wins..in what appears to be a WINNER TELL ALL truth.
1031 2018-03-22 21:46:21 "All right, sir, thanks for choosing us to do your oil change today. Did you get your receipt? Great. One more thing: do you want to check out my mixtape? It's $10."
1032 2018-03-22 21:46:12 Exactly. Remember we had a discussion about this after listening to Mick Jenkins Waters album. (@FREENATION5).. water is devalued right now cause people focusing on oil diamonds and gold. We waste so much clean water everyday
1033 2018-03-22 21:46:11 It's very good for you and a darned sight cheaper to #growyourown than pay £1 per packet in the supermarket. Steam or microwave lightly then stir-fry in sesame oil with some lemon juice. I do sometimes have some with my bit of fish. But don't tell anyone.

1040 2018-03-22 21:45:14 How come these idiots w money will work hard as hell with coal oil and nuclear power plants but not put that same effort and planning into water, electricity or wind power.

It’s not impossible. If they put that same energy into a better source, I’m pretty sure it’d be successful
1041 2018-03-22 21:45:05 Not even a bit of olive oil and vinegar/lemon/lime juice?

1081 2018-03-22 21:40:21 Unfortunately the @albertaNDP like the @Alberta_UCP before them still have no plan how to diversify our economy relying on oil. I mean it's still a big part of Alberta, but we need to be aggressive moving in a new direction while still keeping an eye on our energy resources.

1099 2018-03-22 21:38:53 I roasted them in the oven on 475°, I don’t quite remember how long but they cooked in no time and I like them to be al dente. Oh, and spray or oil your pan.
1100 2018-03-22 21:38:53 @FBN_help ordinarily any failed transfer sh oil be reverted within 24hrs what's happe ei g to my money?
1101 2018-03-22 21:38:48 Which ones ? Unlike Clinton selling off Getty oil ? Hillary and Obama giving Russia skolkovo and uranium , sanctioning Exxon , Biden and Kerry selling technology to Chinese military ?
1102 2018-03-22 21:38:46 I say that 2 areas n the world (Russia & Middle East) completely dependent on oil. Original thought was since rexxon (tillerson) was oil man, they’d have their way w him. They did to a point (decimated state dept) then discarded him. @centerfluid what says you?

1106 2018-03-22 21:38:13 Exactly...or stayed in the oil business with Exxon lol
1107 2018-03-22 21:38:11 Yooo you could add some dill in there for aroma, and do a pot transfer to another pot with olive oil on the bottom to get some golden crunchy rice
1108 2018-03-22 21:38:06 put some tea tree oil on my nose piercing. ready to start my youtube channel
1109 2018-03-22 21:38:02 The great escape is on! We're struck in the middle of the highway because we had an oil leak. Pffft. #PeanutsJourney (because she's with us) #adventure
1110 2018-03-22 21:37:59 Remember when we talked like 15yrs ago about how electric cars were so important to national security so we could get out of the Middle East? I see that you’re partly right about the power/ influence. War and oil are big business for the old guard. Change will come though.
1111 2018-03-22 21:37:52 also hi , good evening , talking about painting earlier kinda gave me the urge to try oil painting again
but it's too late to just go fetch my canvas and brushes .. that or I'll be painting all night sooooo .. no
1112 2018-03-22 21:37:48 Even oil companies are scared shitless from loosing customers they believe #climatehusteria. Just like politicians submitted their believes to favour electoral gains. Even lies find a messenger to convey them if the marketing plot is good enough.

1115 2018-03-22 21:37:29 No oil, safe from our freedom.
1116 2018-03-22 21:37:19 bruh im such a sucker. went in a for a basic oil change and got convinced to get the most expensive one and new windshield wipers.
1117 2018-03-22 21:37:11 Wow! Oil industry accepts what all national Governments have accepted since decades. That is a major break through for them. In't it?
1118 2018-03-22 21:37:08 Difficult call to make, oil is heading up this could move inflation back to 3%. But with a trade war brewing and the effects this will have, do you want to turn the screw on cheap money?
1119 2018-03-22 21:37:08  those look painful.. wet a doek or towel when you get home then wrap it on your head, or base your scalp with castor oil or coconut oil then spray it with hair spray or water  to loosen the braids.
1120 2018-03-22 21:37:06 Saw an ad the other day I think shell the oil company has started electric charging stations, does this mean their nearly out of oil. @elonmusk

1125 2018-03-22 21:36:33 Just when we’re being told that we’re energy independent, big oil makes the move to start exporting oil. Right.

1127 2018-03-22 21:36:24 Interior lease sale today for all federal waters of Gulf of Mexico. Zinke said today's sale -  touted as "the largest in U.S. history" - would serve as "a bellwether" on where oil/ gas companies want to spend money drilling. The auction will offer up about 77 million acres.

1132 2018-03-22 21:35:43 Something about driving your car with a new oil change that just makes you drive with more confidence. Lmao
1133 2018-03-22 21:35:35 Let's be frank why is America in Afghanistan? Oh, yeah, it only has 5 trillion dollars worth of resources and the largest lithium mine in the world. Why did America invade Iraq when he had nothing to do with 9/11. Oh yeah it only has oil resources.

What's he like? it's not double. Breath Man
1138 2018-03-22 21:34:02 Why is salad dressing so expensive? It's basically cooking oil diluted with vinegar. Shouldn't it be cheaper than cooking oil then?

1140 2018-03-22 21:33:49 My grandfather who was a jeweler, taught me always to be gentle with opals. I learned that from watching how he stored them - in little bottles covered in baby oil! He said they were fragile, and could dry out, and to wipe them down with a little oil on cotton once in a while.
1141 2018-03-22 21:33:23 Finding innovative ways to deal with water insecurity, will become the paving stone toward stemming new wars, fought not over oil, diamonds, and land, but water. #SuDs #WorldWaterDay

1152 2018-03-22 21:31:58 BLM exists to manage forestry, cattle, mining, oil & gas, and recreational uses of Federal land, but oil dominates in terms of GDP, so maybe this tweet says more about how some people are offended by certain industries rather than the BLM not having its priorities straight.

1158 2018-03-22 21:31:27 structural reliance on oil and gas, which persists, despite the fact that prices tanked 4 years ago. leadership has no plan for new economic growth. State Senate has stonewalled all ideas for revenue generation, instead we've spent Billions of CBR.

1160 2018-03-22 21:31:21 Just helped an elderly American tourist find his gate in Dubai airport. As we parted ways, he thanked me with, 'If I had any money, I'd buy you an oil well.'
1161 2018-03-22 21:31:07 I see you are a leafs fan and therefore part of the ignorant group that immediately assumed that since the Leafs are in the playoffs they would be "Canada's team". Vegas won't do anything...Nashville and Tampa are tough but the Jets are damn good.
1162 2018-03-22 21:31:03 If you haven't had a temperature, it's unlikely antibiotics will help. Keep heat against the ear to soothe the pain. Have you tried using pure peppermint oil? A few drops in the ear might help?

1164 2018-03-22 21:31:00 Ummm i just added a stinky but MIRACULOUS oil in my hair and soon i’ll wash it and soon i’ll get rid of this bitch ass hair color
1165 2018-03-22 21:30:59 Oh man, these are great. Had to go back to the brackets for a few laughs:
-“US civilian drone strikes” - you mean the one that killed al-Awlaki? I think most (real) Americans would sign off on that one
-“Handling of BP oil spill” - How did Obama handle that scandalously? 
Thx bro

1182 2018-03-22 21:29:49 watching the mechanics diagnose my car when i just came in for an oil change is hilarious lmao like i know my car is dying ok
1183 2018-03-22 21:29:42 Just wait until @jkenney gets in and he restricts the flow of oil to BC. You ain't seen nothin' yet; $3-$4/l8tr for gas or even higher. Yes, get the pipeline built.
1184 2018-03-22 21:29:39 Tell wes to oil it up & break it down

1190 2018-03-22 21:28:53 Remember this is the same company that helped fund the Keystone Pipeline that spilled 210,000 gallons of oil, contaminating ground water.

1191 2018-03-22 21:28:18 Odio a todos los que trabajan en la Oil. Literal.
1192 2018-03-22 21:28:12 I don’t foresee it happening for awhile simply because of the power and impact of the oil industry. The technology could feasibly be affordable relatively soon.
1193 2018-03-22 21:28:05 Can someone take over my life just for two hours? Make dinner, take my kid to ballet and squeeze in an oil change. Oh and fold some laundry too :)

1197 2018-03-22 21:27:27 Why sue big oil if we need their product?
Because they actively took part in a misinformation campaign that has successfully delayed taking action on addressing climate change. This broadens the scope of their responsibility to beyond just oil CO2 emissions.

1213 2018-03-22 21:24:06 This is a generalization I’ll probably regret, but it seems that gas and oil prices always go up under GOP administrations.
1214 2018-03-22 21:24:04 I care. He’s a snake oil salesman. Zero integrity.
1215 2018-03-22 21:23:59 Btwn 2010-11 and 2014-15, oil prices were $90/barrel, but AB governments ran deficits in all but one year, Ceci says #ableg

1218 2018-03-22 21:23:35 If it’s cold and wet,especially if it’s raining,rub baby oil over your body,arms and legs. It stops the water sticking and you stay a lot warmer. This tip was given to me by an old fell runner and it works. Plus as an extra bonus,the girls think you smell nice 
1219 2018-03-22 21:23:13 My dad just taught me how to change the oil in my car and I honestly feel like my life is coming together. It might seem stupid, but that was a big step for me and now I'm ready to work on all the other shit that needs improving

1222 2018-03-22 21:22:45 Actually, he wasn't "Russian". He was from Azerbaijan which was part of the Soviet Union at the time. Azerbaijan really isn't Russia although you can get some really rough vodka there, less so since all the oil & gas money really started reflowing.

1243 2018-03-22 21:20:48 It's not that it's unhealthy that bothers me. I just don't like the way food turns out cooked that way. I don't like oil. Like, at all. Any kind. Even things that "don't taste like oil" tastes like fucking oil. Just like mayonnaise tastes nothing but pure greasy vinegar.
1244 2018-03-22 21:20:29 On the whole I agree, but I also see a lot of snake oil on the market... which I think the consulting industry should stand up and eliminate from their ranks. 

I understand one can’t always deliver, but too many promise and never intend to try.
1245 2018-03-22 21:20:29 NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO @Walmart in Marietta,Ohio for an oil change.They didn’t put the oil cap back on correctly and that’s why we broke down-oil leaked out completely.

1258 2018-03-22 21:18:56 At the Ram dealership getting an oil change me and my baby girl started playing the switch in tabletop mode had a few people interested. If they pick one up today like a few said they were Nintendo I want my cut.

1262 2018-03-22 21:18:28 You could maybe do them in an air fryer? Some oil spray and a toss in a small bit of seasoning and pop them in a low temp for 5-10 minutes at a time is my best guess.
1263 2018-03-22 21:17:44 Apple cider vinegar. Cotton ball. Swirl it around. Kills the cysts off quickly. Tee tree oil on top. Brings all the shit to the surface. U should be cleared up in no time.

1407 2018-03-22 21:00:29 Neck Oil a great beer though, whatever country you're in! Had a few good Lervig's in my time too.
1408 2018-03-22 21:00:19 So I just read the ingredients on one of my @NatureValley bars and it has palm oil in it which results in deforestation so it'd be great if no one bought the companies bars.

They want more stuff, but when they ban the common ingredients for said products, they cry bloody murder!
1416 2018-03-22 20:59:45 Gonna oil my scalp with castor 3 times a week. I hope this works.
1417 2018-03-22 20:59:38 Today I got my inspection sticker, oil changed, new bank account, and a gym membership..I’m so proud of myself
1418 2018-03-22 20:59:30 I guess I’ll never get out the oil field
1419 2018-03-22 20:59:22 God NO... more neocons  How soon we forget WMD's in Iraq and millions dead. Any country left standing with oil not controlled by OPEC to create artificial scarcity to prop up the private federal reserve petro dollar should prepare accordingly.

1421 2018-03-22 20:59:02 Did you discuss how you killed Energy East by stealth and our chance for energy independence. Not to mention the jobs that would be created. Oh well you saved a few longshoremen’s jobs in Quebec that unload the overseas oil
1422 2018-03-22 20:58:55 You could "wrestle" me anytime.  As long as we are both nude and covered in oil.
1423 2018-03-22 20:58:41 You do these "ordinary kiwis" employed in the oil and gas industry a disservice by failing to acknowledge the fact that business as usual is no longer acceptable & failing to plan for a transition away from these polluting forms of energy.
1424 2018-03-22 20:58:39 They need to hurry up with this oil change
1425 2018-03-22 20:58:22 Tax each barrel of oil they export to US.

1429 2018-03-22 20:57:56 Since I wasn’t up for anything active today I thought I’d get my oil changed. Oil change, sit filter, tires rotated and balanced, nail removed from one tire and plugged and brakes on front and back. Expensive afternoon $$$$$

1434 2018-03-22 20:57:03 Not every jurisdiction had the benefit of oil revenues like AB. No doubt a tax hike would have been required but seeing our taxes are already solo wouldn’t hurt as much as if it had been done in any other province.

1439 2018-03-22 20:56:17 I know this may be the unpopular opinion.
Colin Kaepernick should get looks way way way before the snake oil salesman who is a very smooth talker which is Manziel.

1450 2018-03-22 20:55:33 I talked to my conservative mom about me using CBD oil to treat my anxiety, and she said there isn't enough research on the long term side effects. My response was "CBD comes from weed so if there are long-term side effects, I'm already gonna get them" 
1451 2018-03-22 20:55:23 While California has a diverse economic base, Texas is exposed to commodity markets especially oil, gas, agriculture. So, the governor can't do much now when prices go down. However, they could also diversify for the long run but Texans despise the successful Californian way.
1452 2018-03-22 20:55:22 Rex Tillerson, the man who made a living undermining US foreign policy by negotiating oil contracts with war-torn Kurdish Iraq, just described Washington D.C., as "mean-spirited."
1453 2018-03-22 20:55:22 I hope you feel better soon.

I find Olive oil in my ear three times a day when they’re blocked helps. 
It soften the wax, which is usually the common source of blockages. 

I’m partly deaf so ear infections are my basically old friends of mine, so I get it. I hope this helps
1454 2018-03-22 20:55:13 Thank you so much for sharing this incredible information, @OldTimeZen ! We can't seem to choose a favorite oil, but if we could, we are sure Rosemary would be up there! Isn't this oil absolutely incredible?
1455 2018-03-22 20:55:12 Oil companies are exploiting the PES bankruptcy in their demands that President Trump and Congress undermine the #RFS by capping or waiving RIN obligations. #dontmesswiththerfs #ACE18DC
1456 2018-03-22 20:55:12 Inshsa Allah. All goes well as planed & find oil.
1457 2018-03-22 20:55:04 is disney the last company to remember that "buying out the competition" is a p damn effective strategy in capitalism? its always baffled me that oil companies don't buy solar companies
1458 2018-03-22 20:54:59 None have lasted as socialist. Norway can be socialist until oil runs out or is replaced. Then what? Sweden and Denmark (and rest of Europe) can't sustain socialism due to demographic cliff, and are finding the replacements they imported don't have commitment to system.
1459 2018-03-22 20:54:55 Yes, I'll never forgive that bastard for learning Russians meddled in the 2016 election, murdered a guy in the UK in 2018, and sold oil to North Korea in 2017 despite the sanctions and STILL congratulating Putin in 2018.
1460 2018-03-22 20:54:52 "Many celebs use deodorant on the red carpet for their face. lt absorbs the oil and stops the shine!"
1461 2018-03-22 20:54:51 how interesting! I have a book on oil pigments...cow urine, and if I remember wrappings from Egyptian mummy's...I think they are out of stock too!
1462 2018-03-22 20:54:46 Honestly it’s amazing. For a snack get olive oil and put the balsamic vinegar in it and dip thick crusty bread in .. that won’t disappoint either

1466 2018-03-22 20:53:51 Yep. Soft landing turns on reserve currency, UST as flight to safety, trade war etc. @LukeGromen argues (well) that USD should ditch reserve status, & devalued dollar restores US competitiveness & fixes unnatural imbalances. (China & Russia might force this anyway via oil)
1467 2018-03-22 20:53:33 Whole time I was checking to see what my oil percentage is on cause I usually wait for the light to come onand I scroll down and see my front tire pressure is 27

1473 2018-03-22 20:52:43 In SA it could, not in international markets. I think 2nd half of calendar year, we’ll be viewing oil markets and oil businesses very differently.

1480 2018-03-22 20:51:01 I'm trying to figure out how people are gonna respond to this. Green activists--will they say "Even oil co acknowledges IPCC". Conservative activists--can they admit IPCC science, or do they keep denying it?

1487 2018-03-22 20:50:28 Molti prodotti industriali si dichiarano palm oil free. Quindi cosa mettono? Burro no (un velo), altri oli? I costi di quei prodotti sono aumentati, niente olio di palma, e il gusto va dal cartone al cartongesso...meglio pane e marmellata....

1503 2018-03-22 20:48:48 BC tourism industry creates more economic activity, more to our GDP than the entire oil and gas industry.

I don't get this loyalty to the fossil fuel industry.
1504 2018-03-22 20:48:45 Saudi Arabia is the worst Islamic country that exists, they force the women to wear burkas but let the men enjoy strip clubs, perform torture and other barbaric things. These ideologies spread after Saudi found oil in the 1970s, Iran, Afghanistan and Somalia are victims of it.

1510 2018-03-22 20:48:32 Everything (you only need salt, pepper & oil) gets delivered to work in measured out packages and super easy to make recipes. They’ve all been mega tasty, maybe a bit on the expensive side but I’m lazy

1536 2018-03-22 20:45:03 Premier @jjhorgan just confirmed he is a #BCLiberal shill under the @BCNDP banner. 

Horgan announced his plan to court oil & gas up north & offering billions of tax credits & incentives for it.   BCLiberal media fan Keith Baldrey could barely conceal his excitement.

1537 2018-03-22 20:45:03 I think the VC bite is stronger—oils from puglia tend to have a more peppery finish, so maybe you had a Puglia style oil from Callie!
1538 2018-03-22 20:44:57 I really think Trumpco are trying multiple ways to make a few bucks while they can. 1) Kushner and the UAE/S.A. 2) infrastructure no bids 3) Rosneft/oil deals 4) Insider trading. Add to that their expensive taste, all of this will start to hurt us soon.

1541 2018-03-22 20:43:54 Wayne Tracker, you are an oil man that denied climate change for decades and did oil deals with notorious dictators! 

Maybe it just hurts when you are on the receiving end. That's called Karma.

1544 2018-03-22 20:43:34 Is the oil industry warm and fuzzy?
1545 2018-03-22 20:43:34 there should really be a wikipedia IPCC that can be constantly updated.

it would be an “amazing resource” for the oil industry (and everyone else who relies on climate science)!
1546 2018-03-22 20:43:34 yup. i had a trip planned for some sporting gear & apparel.  not now!
1547 2018-03-22 20:43:30 not much fantasy on your side. could accelerate selling treasuries. start trading oil in renmimbi, undermining the usd. could end sanctions on N.Korea... and so on

1556 2018-03-22 20:43:00 There is a myth that refiners will all change to sweet crude. First there is not tonnes of sweet oil sat doing nothing and second the new sweet oil is light with little maritime gasoil and LSFO
1557 2018-03-22 20:42:58 The former head of MI6 in the UK and special adviser during the Iraq war joined BP 2 years after the invasion. BP lobbied the goverment relentlessly to get a piece of the action and won the rights to drill the 3rd largest oil reserve in the world. Generates $100m of oil PER DAY!

She refused & was impeached.#qanon

This is why supporting the “lesser evil” doesn’t work.

1590 2018-03-22 20:38:33 @RosannaPansino Hi Ro! Quick question; I really want to make your homemade churros, but I don't have any coconut oil. Can there be a substitute, or is it mandatory that I have it? Thanks!! Much  to you!
1591 2018-03-22 20:38:32 US per capita oil use is eyewatering.  If China and India used that,  it would suck the world's current production dry.  That means horses for your tractor. China and India get rich,people now want a car or motor bike and travel by plane.
1592 2018-03-22 20:38:22 You can big it up: top quality sausage, bacon & BP; fried thick white bread, runny egg, plenty of mushrooms steamed with butter & grilled toms ...& minimise the grease/oil....oh & serve it with lots of black #coffee

1595 2018-03-22 20:38:08 The Economist: Oil producers need only look at Venezuela to see how rapidly falling oil revenues can force an autocratic state to break its bargain with the people, leading to economic turmoil, social instability and regional tension.

1597 2018-03-22 20:37:52 I make these Italian wings in there. Olive oil, Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese. Then I make a balsamic drizzle and pour basil butter over them. Also it makes a nice lightly breaded wing in there

1606 2018-03-22 20:36:44 I need an oil change bad as fuck
1607 2018-03-22 20:36:33 Maybe they plan on burning the surplus up just moving it around?:) Other than that, you're point is key, it's not increased 'true demand', it's simply increased refining. #oil #opec #oott

1610 2018-03-22 20:36:21 yeah absolutely we are going to run out of food an water. I mean we’re destroying entire habitats of orangutans just to farm palm oil to keep our skin smooth. I think an average of 200 species go extinct every day.

1673 2018-03-22 20:28:12 Question on the pipes. After initial flow from HH, did they change the pipes before sealing and putting the container over it?
1674 2018-03-22 20:28:08 So he along with other wanted control over oil reserves but additionally he became part of the bombing to vaporize the real funding source of 60 million dollars from Qaddafi to him as election contribution. Some of these western leaders make us sick. Hypocrites
1675 2018-03-22 20:28:04 Love too have hot oil dumped on my head as i attempt to storm an enemy castle
1676 2018-03-22 20:28:00 Air fryer. Toss fresh or defrosted wings in a little oil. Cook for 25 minutes then put your sauce on them. You'll kick yourself at how easy and tasty they are.
1677 2018-03-22 20:27:57 it's not actually the oil that works, it's more the massaging that helps it
1678 2018-03-22 20:27:39 What is it with people selling any snake oil that makes you shit yourself as a "cleanse". That's horrible
1679 2018-03-22 20:27:23 Snake(s) oil!
1680 2018-03-22 20:27:21 My insides are a river of burning oil.
1681 2018-03-22 20:26:58 The lavender oil, sage incense cones, badger balm and wheat bag in my bedroom are in stark contrast with the large bag of narcotics I brought home. I still believe in trying natural remedies first though
1682 2018-03-22 20:26:54 technically it's just plain argan oil in a beard oil jar. $10-15 at shoppers, i think.
1683 2018-03-22 20:26:44 Nothing test my patience more than getting a oil change at wal mart

1685 2018-03-22 20:26:11 true but it also was an extraordinary time for resource rich economies, remeber the commodity supercycle? oil, nickel, gas, steel... all dirt cheap in russia at that time
1686 2018-03-22 20:26:02 Going to be putting lavender essential oil in the bath before I go to bed hoping that will work.
1687 2018-03-22 20:25:45 I wish to be addressed by those employees as thou and thee (thine and thy), not you, your, and yours. Thou hadst better take care or thou shalt suffer mickel inequities!

1690 2018-03-22 20:24:47 I need to find an oil change place where I don't have to get out the car; and they don't give me a list of everything that's wrong and their recommendations to fix it.
1691 2018-03-22 20:24:39 Again, #KRG dont face their responsability and show their incompetence... They chose their self-interest in the buisness of oil over their own people... They have no limits
1692 2018-03-22 20:24:21 @hammerandnigel 1 in 10 has cocaine but 8 in 10 has baby oil and coco butter

1700 2018-03-22 20:23:34 Having me some cannabus oil - is it still ok to say "Fuck the Police" in 2018? Big up to Tupac, Dr Dre, Snoop Dog and the rest of Deathrow Records! We love you...Don't care if you're East Side or West Side - Athlone is Athlone! — feeling delighted
1701 2018-03-22 20:23:24 And every niave farmer who voted for this snake oil salesman.
1702 2018-03-22 20:23:20 It's not just Putin. This is a crooks economic war...I think at the top it is Putin vs. Cheney. They are stuck in the race for oil and the world is ready to move forward. Errand boy Giuliani is now preaching democracy in Iran! Whose side is he on? Putin or Cheney or both?
1703 2018-03-22 20:23:17 Yeah that’s what I also thought till he faced Spurs and had the most turnovers ever maybe his hands were slippery cause of beard oil

1706 2018-03-22 20:22:58 Just watched the CBD oil one. Really good. Has that worked well for you?
1707 2018-03-22 20:22:48 Thought that was how the establishment creates itself through privileged,elite networks which oil the cogs of the system.
1708 2018-03-22 20:22:38 Feels like being caught up in that long string of commercials just before Super Bowl kick off.
1709 2018-03-22 20:22:38 You've met me. You know I'm slicker than an oil spill.
1710 2018-03-22 20:22:36 “Analysts” and news channels should stop telling the public what oil companies want them to say and call it what it is: corporate greed. Doing otherwise is an insult to our intelligence. Side not: thanks NDP, for absolutely nothing.
1711 2018-03-22 20:22:25 Pan fry your pizza with olive oil. Ain't that healthy? 
1712 2018-03-22 20:22:24 Paris is way too under ambitious to what's required.  However most governments are still in denial. The peak of fossil fuel use maybe years away.  However it's essential we continue investment in renewable energy and start transition away from oil. Transport huge
1713 2018-03-22 20:22:20 @JustinTrudeau whats up motha fucka, yo when you legalize kush put CBD oil in the OHIP+ coverage. you'd save my fuckin life bro. respect
1714 2018-03-22 20:22:16 Better start building water pipelines instead of oil.
1715 2018-03-22 20:22:13 Would rather poison my breakfast juice with the same poisons you are allowing your corporate chemical/coal/oil buddies  to pour in our waterways!
1716 2018-03-22 20:22:12 Would you rather kill living creatures including humans? For the sake of a dirty corporations that only worship money? I choose life over oil. There's no need for another pipeline. Once built, the pipeline will become the justification for staying addicted to dirty oil.
1717 2018-03-22 20:22:11 I need to try that black castor oil eco gel , it’s supposed to work hella good
1718 2018-03-22 20:22:02 You’re bringing up bill? Well than Nixon was a crook, Hillary killed in Benghazi ? How about the thousands of soldiers that bush Jr killed in the phoney Iraq WMD war, or SR in the Kuwaiti I want oil war, etc etc etc the republicans have blood in their  hands  too

1722 2018-03-22 20:21:46 I found some in a caffie going around pen y pas on my bike. They drenched my salad in all sorts of oil.
1723 2018-03-22 20:21:41 Bang on Adrian!
Flow commenced at instantaneous rate in excess of 700bpd in an approx mix of 50:50 oil to water. well was then choked to 32/64" resulting in a steady early oil rate in excess of 463 bopd over a further 7.3-hr period, approx mix of over 99% oil &less than 1% water
1724 2018-03-22 20:21:38 I’m seriously in love with it. Some taste like garbage but you really have to find a good oil that works for you some  are straight bogus def do your research.
1725 2018-03-22 20:21:38 Have you worked in an international oil company before ? 
Have you worked in YOUR national oil company before ? 
I’m guessing the answer to both is no? 
Kindly sit down.

1728 2018-03-22 20:21:03 Bernie Sanders was selling the same snake oil.
1729 2018-03-22 20:20:57 I keep chickening out on coloring mine... largely because I need help doing that oil slick ombre.
1730 2018-03-22 20:20:46 Maybe you could try CBD oil, I believe it's legal to order that online. It's supposed to help with many things including pain. I hope it can help you.I have RSD/CRPS too with other Dx's. Also try Tumeric for general good health. My P meds were cut in Nov. also.
1731 2018-03-22 20:20:40 Guy’s go get your self stonewood silk oil, this will change your life

1734 2018-03-22 20:20:07 Dana, I'm about 90% ZC/MeatEggs. The other 10% = cocoa pwdr (no sugar), tea, coffee, some olive oil, dried herbs for flavor, fresh onions/garlic, mushrooms, lemon juice. Last summer my only veggies were pesto (fresh basil, cilantro, dill). Allows me to be in nutritional ketosis.
1735 2018-03-22 20:20:06 My God what a beautiful lake, looks like oil, so peaceful...
1736 2018-03-22 20:20:05 Norway is an oil and gas country. I’d venture a guess that they probably have better human rights than Canada.
1737 2018-03-22 20:19:58 Literally been waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes FOR A FUCKING OIL CHANGE.
1738 2018-03-22 20:19:56 My blankets smell of olive oil and my sheets smell of stay soft. 
1739 2018-03-22 20:19:54 I must debate it's Not!

1740 2018-03-22 20:19:49 Too funny . My suspension was in reference to t i d e  p o d s as well when I posted a meme about the secret chocolate fountain under their cars (oil drain). Promoting self harm lmfao

I love food but I don’t buy that at all That’s a very scary proposition because you can make just about anything taste good with extra oil butter n high sodium products, which are essentially killing the man, so nah I’m good
1743 2018-03-22 20:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

1745 2018-03-22 20:18:58 Some girls without make up be looking like roasted yam on palm oil.
1746 2018-03-22 20:18:47 To enhance, balance, and maintain mental acuity and cognition, drink a cup of herbal tea of Gotu Kola, Bacopa, Suma root, Eleuthero root, Tulsi (Holy Basil), and Ginkgo Biloba leaf daily. Diffusing the essential oil of Rosemary is another great way of improving brain performance.
1747 2018-03-22 20:18:46 Is this Trump's Waterloo ??  His supporters don't care much about sex scandals, Moslem bans, Mexican walls, Charlottesville, ethical violations, friendship with Putin or using public land for oil drilling.  But when Dow loses almost 3% due to ill thought out tariffs, UH OH !!

1753 2018-03-22 20:17:39 I already contacted them and the only solution provided was a refund when I wanted a change. You should check that policy. Now I cannot cook as I don't have my olive oil...
1754 2018-03-22 20:17:34 As a fiscal conservative, how do you feel about ten million a minute in world wide oil and gas subsidies according to the imf. Just imagine what renewables could do with a quarter of that.

1758 2018-03-22 20:17:00 sad about accusations and speculation on the @BahiCosmetics SSS. i literally have a video on the ingredients and the oil as a whole on my TY because there’s like 5 ingredients. stop being lazy & do your own research. took me like 20 minutes lol.
1759 2018-03-22 20:16:52 It’s always something in this damn library. Bitches just walked by me smelling like pure fried food oil and cigs.
1760 2018-03-22 20:16:35 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1761 2018-03-22 20:16:16 Don't forget it's France who put Libya where they are today. You can thank them for starting a war that killed the brits who had no business except for oil there
1762 2018-03-22 20:16:05 Having a car is all fun and games until you needed an oil change last week , new tires this week , plate sticker due this month , have to pass emissions test , gotta fill your tank up every few days , window sticker due tomorrow like lordeth I’m getting me a bike fuck it

1766 2018-03-22 20:15:34 Right now all “news” is suspect. I judge by observing. I don’t trust socialism/communism. Millions dead under Stalin, 70 million plus dead under Mao. Venezuela is wealthy in oil and as beautiful as Hawaii but it’s people starve. Communism kills! That is where Dems take us.
1767 2018-03-22 20:15:32 LOL

1770 2018-03-22 20:14:48 Yes. You should honestly go to an Oil and Gas sure in another country. I am interested in the Environment and the economy. Are you really saying Human rights around the world are as good as they are in Canada?

1781 2018-03-22 20:13:40 Brought my car in for an oil change today... ended up needing to get 4 new tires and now I have to sell a kidney to pay for it all. 
1782 2018-03-22 20:13:30 Soapy spray, neem oil, a concoction with bicarbonate of soda and garlic, brushing / knocking them off. Most work to lessen them initially, but you have to do / apply daily for effect. Fine mesh netting probably the only fail safe solution.
1783 2018-03-22 20:13:21 You calling oil short for the last 6 Trading days for massssssssiivvvve prrrrrrrooooooooofits! Embarrassing for everyone concerned.

1790 2018-03-22 20:12:49 @realDonaldTrump how is that stock market doing?  When voters open their 401k statements and compare the 50cent/week tax relief, I guess sell them more snake oil.
1791 2018-03-22 20:12:37 Are you okay? That kind of trauma can take a while to get over.  Also, was she hot?
1792 2018-03-22 20:12:27 Which outlets ?
1793 2018-03-22 20:12:25 "Oil on canvas"
1794 2018-03-22 20:12:25 Adrien gasped slightly, leaning toward it to get a better look. “So... it’s not like you put a coat of some oil or something on it?” He asked, his green eyes looking up at her once more. She was crazy amazing at baking. He could smell the fresh bagel. The scent was incredible.
1795 2018-03-22 20:12:23 @CannTrust Hi I am a client and wondering 2 things.  Do you carry the "pens"
that can be used (already with thc cbd in them or as I use a vaporizer for
smoking cigarettes (getting off cigarettes) with a liquid fill can I put oil in
this vaporizer?  I am using an E leaf vaporizer.
1796 2018-03-22 20:12:19 He said cut was increasing. Tenner #Hirsehill started out 50% cut then Gushed 100% oil. That 3000 bobp supposed Schlumberger north Sea chaps tweet caused the premature rns imo.

1799 2018-03-22 20:12:14 It felt weird initially but after the first couple times having a creamy, white substance in your mouth becomes second nature...so that’s how I feel about oil pulling
1800 2018-03-22 20:12:00 Dude all I take at this point regularly is a vitamin, fish oil that’s high in EPA and creatine.
1801 2018-03-22 20:11:54 When plastic has a scrap value like Copper / Aluminium / Steel the sea will be emptied of it to cash in. Plastic pyrolysis to diesel & oil should be mandatory in all countries. Recycling is preferable but not easy.
1802 2018-03-22 20:11:41 Hey @JimCarrey !

Your quite outspoken lately. 

What say you about all the homelessness in Los Angeles? 

Immense skid row in your backyard. Should be at least a mention of it. 

Fundraiser? 

Town Hall?

Maybe a portrait of it? 

Oil or acrylic? Pencil maybe?

1806 2018-03-22 20:11:18 Oil is not that competitive anymore
1807 2018-03-22 20:11:15 so funny when I get my oil changed and they try to force me into shit I don’t need for my car like 4 brand new tires???? Like I’m a dummy and won’t call my daddy up here 
1808 2018-03-22 20:11:15 Liberals and respect ? Oil and water my friend !
1809 2018-03-22 20:11:14 Did that with hydraulic oil once. Never a good deal
1810 2018-03-22 20:10:55 WTI oil $64.76/barrel, -$0.40.
1811 2018-03-22 20:10:42 Though l dont knw d full details, one thing l can easily relate with is Nigeria is not a strong exporting nation. Most countries that we share boundaries with produce/export 1 or 2 products larger than us eg Cocoa, Palm oil, vehicles, cattles,etc. Might not be a good deal for us

1817 2018-03-22 20:10:08 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
1818 2018-03-22 20:10:05 You did a great job calling things during February, but your own pinned tweet indicated you thought mkt would retest or break Feb low. I think you misread the oil rally as "liquidity is great", but I have mentioned repeatedly it's likely rallying on mideast risk, not liquidity.
1819 2018-03-22 20:09:53 Taking prenatal definitely helped with the shine and thickness. Take some fish oil and vitamin E supplements. That might help!

1830 2018-03-22 20:08:38 Bottom line: These politicians are not scientists and are paid by corporations representing the oil and gas industry; in return, they allow the corporations to dictate what is a "fact".

1846 2018-03-22 20:07:15 There is no gas shortage, man, it's all fake. The oil companies control everything. Like, there's this guy who invented this car... that runs on water, man. It's got fiber glass air cooled engine and it runs on water!
1847 2018-03-22 20:07:13 On the plus side, aluminium is one of the most recyclable materials out there!

1851 2018-03-22 20:06:16 I've been wondering that and no one seems to know for sure what those pipes were for. Did SS achieve anything close to a 100% oil cut?
1852 2018-03-22 20:06:11 Vitamin e oil really does work. Also try using apple cider vinegar as a toner maybe once a day it realllly helps dark spots.

1862 2018-03-22 20:04:51 Tip to clean your ears: 

Put a bit of oil- baby oil or Alo Vera (I think)- onto the tip of ear bud- then clean your ears by rotating it- basically your just looking to apply the oil around the ear drum- it’ll work wonders
1863 2018-03-22 20:04:30 Did you try a stainless steel cleaner - more like oil?  I think it will help - if nothing else.

1870 2018-03-22 20:03:48 The West preaches democracy in Africa  but rarely practices it. For instance, Norway is sponsoring somalia in the ICJ to hive off part of the kenyan coast so that they gain unfettered to offshore oil exploration blocks. Saitan! Kwenda kabisa
1871 2018-03-22 20:03:43 It's a noble effort for the average person to consevre water, but it's large corporations and industries like mining and oil that use and pollute billions of litres of water (individually) annually. Government needs to green big business, not low-consumptive citizens

1877 2018-03-22 20:02:43 i mean then i guess olive oil could also be seasoning on something very plain like rice or noodles? but i still wouldn't consider fats a seasoning... u can season fats like garlic butter or something but idk if the butter itself is a seasoning even on popcorn just my onion

1882 2018-03-22 20:01:58 Yeah it’s the warming up most people have to adjust to, but humans rarely wipe it out immediately (cause lazy) & if they do it’s a hot pan with a little water then put back on the warm burner to dry. (The only paper towels in the house are mine.) No salt, no oil, no worries.
1883 2018-03-22 20:01:45 There must be some oil stored somewhere because they flowed 10-70 bfpd for 96 hours of which 30-50% was oil. SS then said he was cleaning up the well to get 100% oil cut.

1946 2018-03-22 19:52:59 Ouch, Lucia! That's not awesome. If you ever get this blend in your eyes again we recommend wiping it away with a soft cloth and vegetable oil!
1947 2018-03-22 19:52:51 Nailed the sauce for veggie stir fry. Ginger, lemongrass, chilli, sesame oil, soy sauce and a splash of honey

1948 2018-03-22 19:52:41 Great satire piece! In all seriousness though, You can thank oil companies, trying to control the river and global warming for that. Louisiana loses almost a football field a of land an hour.

1955 2018-03-22 19:51:57 The pipeline is to export oil to other countries. It can’t be refined in BC anyway. Some experts think the pipeline expansion will increase the cost of gas in BC.

1958 2018-03-22 19:51:36 the ultra repair cream doesn’t work with my budget anymore sadly but you can get a little thing of vitamin e oil from target for like $3 and it lasts me about 8 months and i use it twice a day
1959 2018-03-22 19:51:19 Vice News has taken a very unique perspective of Native American people and how the Dakota Access Pipeline affects their land and people.  It shows the struggle that Native Americans have in regards to not having a proper voice like the oil companies do.  #1145Narratives
1960 2018-03-22 19:51:17 whats wrong with vinegar and canola oil? crispy enough for moi. when cooked put chicken on countertop over night.. room temp is good..and may i add ..deep fry the intestines serve with really expensive red hot chilli and purple onions..
1961 2018-03-22 19:51:16 oil is vital so i don´t see a reason why should we fight over it
1962 2018-03-22 19:51:04 Oil base everywhere 
1963 2018-03-22 19:51:02 Frigging Tillerson. Integrity?!?!?

Anyone looking back at Exxon's historically duplicitous and self serving antics in African oil dealings which led to massive human suffering will have grounds for grave doubts about Rex's integrity. 

Maddening.
1964 2018-03-22 19:50:52 Take yesterday’s mashed potato, add your favourite spices (I like cayenne pepper, turmeric, salt, coriander) and a little olive oil and lemon juice to taste. Then spread over uncooked puff pastry and roll up and slice. Brush with egg, sprinkle with sesame seeds & bake! Eat warm
1965 2018-03-22 19:50:50 They look like they could use an oil change and have their power terminals decrystalized
1966 2018-03-22 19:50:40 That oil is the truth.

1969 2018-03-22 19:50:19 first aid beauty ultra repair cream is the bomb my skin is acne prone, extremely dry and super sensitive and the only moisturizer i have found that actually works for my skin!! also vitamin e oil is seriously the best that’s what i use daily
1970 2018-03-22 19:50:03 It's still a great ride, but it has much more Elsa and significantly fewer oil drilling rigs.

Similar number of trolls though
1971 2018-03-22 19:50:02 she tried to explain numerous times after that she uses hemp seed oil, but you know when folks don't like you, shit just goes left. But she should have NEVER tweeted that shit about having a cannabis line.
1972 2018-03-22 19:50:00 March 22, 2018: I, Misty Miller, have officially and finally learned how to change my oil in my jeep all on my own!!! I’m so proud of myself!!!!! 
1973 2018-03-22 19:49:49 Sunlight liquid and coconut oil  stir together. The oil breaks down the make up and the soap cleans it  and then rinse. Takes a few minutes and a bit of massaging but the results are so worth it

1979 2018-03-22 19:48:37 I was an oil panic man 
1980 2018-03-22 19:48:34 here is the issue it stemmed from. Couple months back, a lady tweeted about using cannabis oil based skin care products she made to help her baby who had a skin condition and it really helped. She @'d jeffrey star about making a cannabis based line.
1981 2018-03-22 19:48:27 First, his suggestion of "stick in dishwasher" actually is more wasteful. Second, the fact that he doesn't tell you that you should add two tablespoons of oil to the water, is worse. His suggestion will end up being more wasteful when the rice sticks to the bottom of the pot.

1986 2018-03-22 19:47:44 @POTUS 
In my opinion I think you need to lay off the body oil. With this out of control omnibus bill  it seems you are sliding into the swamp. Been for you 100% until now. Pelosi and Schumer are making you look like a fool. It takes about a yr to get in the swamp

1988 2018-03-22 19:47:38 1. LADOL was specifically designed to assist Oil and gas operators but it also provides warehousing facilities to select industries as an ancillary. Also, situating in EKO Atlantic City is another possibility. 
2. Nigeria's addressable market is 20m. Do you really think there...
1989 2018-03-22 19:47:37 The oil type isn’t as important as the rubbing, it promotes blood flow and that’s what will make them thick. Sea salt soaks with hot water will also help. I’ve heard people say good things about “holy butter” but I haven’t personally tried it.
1990 2018-03-22 19:47:32 Sorry dear, its oil bean seed
1991 2018-03-22 19:47:26 Really sad to see such a huge oil spill and all the damaged land around it, but with China using so much more fossil fuels they're bound to incur more accidents while trying to meet their energy demand #PHYS273

1995 2018-03-22 19:47:11 Honestly pretty disappointed with how the season finale of @thexfiles ended...CSM survived a missile to the face but we’re meant to believe he died from a couple of gunshot wounds to the chest? No aliens, no space colonisation, no black oil, no super soldiers?  no real closure.
1996 2018-03-22 19:46:42 Let’s just say that..this Oshun oil from @TheLoveUtopia is working in a mighty way today @KushFruit @LaurynDoll @warmblunttarot @dianarchin @QueenAwakened

1998 2018-03-22 19:46:38 I use Clinique 2 in 1 foundation and then use stay matte powder on top of that to combat the oil. Seems to work really well with my oily skin!
1999 2018-03-22 19:46:33 the oil industry needs to go the way of the dinosaur lest we all go the same route
2000 2018-03-22 19:46:23 Okay, I'll take LNG over OIL but I'd _far_ prefer renewables (yes, even Site C) over either. I get that we remain a resource-based economy but not taxing LNG means not benefiting (enough) from said resources. Work towards the future, please.
2001 2018-03-22 19:46:21 Pretty awesome how their clothes and the buggy they sit in we’re all made from oil, and transported here for purchase on a diesel-oil slurping cargo ship from China.  Cute hypocrisy is still #hypocrisy.

2005 2018-03-22 19:46:02 The Falklands/Malvinas won't magically solve our problems. We need to focus on fixing our own damn problems first, then we can negotiate from strength over things like fishing, oil, etc by trading amicably with Britain and other nations.

2022 2018-03-22 19:43:49 I cured my intense cystic acne when I stopped washing it at all (bad shit in tap water will break u out) and just using a cotton pad and witch hazel twice a day, and coconut oil as a moisturizer IF it is dry. Plus tea tree oil as spot treatment.
2023 2018-03-22 19:43:42 @callie_cm Right on! When was the last time you get your car's oil changed?

2025 2018-03-22 19:43:38 When comparing fish oil supplements, only the EPA and DHA content should be considered, not the total omega-3 content because the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids are due specifically to EPA and DHA

2032 2018-03-22 19:42:42 use a face scrub with raw honey in it, or try using vitamin E oil. You could try something with lemon juice in it also but be careful
2033 2018-03-22 19:42:31 If it was coconut oil I’d be in.
2034 2018-03-22 19:42:30 No prob! I use coconut oil sparingly bc if you use it too much it can clog your pores! Also recommend using hydrocortisone cream overnight for dry patches (but only for a few days at a time bc if you use too much it’ll make it worse) and using a humidifier!

2062 2018-03-22 19:40:11 I dont see why the CNY oil contract would cause a negative reaction in any other market such as USTs. China is not trying to kill the dollar, it is just de-weaponizing it. It has to, otherwise the US can sanction (under some pretext) countries participating in OBOR.

2074 2018-03-22 19:38:52 @rileecoyote sorry to bother you, forgot to mention I'm licensed for medicinal here 5 grams/day Atlantic Canada and anywhere else that's open as far as that goes. Presently using the CBD oil and a indica/hybrid at night.Wish I could make the conference but a little too far for me
2075 2018-03-22 19:38:36 Oil crack the jokes! 
2076 2018-03-22 19:38:35 "This can be a very mean spirited town" Rex said as he emptied a thousand oil drums onto a nearby coral reef. "Very mean spirited"
2077 2018-03-22 19:38:32 Try vitamin e oil!
2078 2018-03-22 19:38:16 Marijuana is an exit strategy for opioid  addiction, also a cure for many afflictions. See "Rick Simpson & Cannabis oil" Hugely significant.
2079 2018-03-22 19:38:07 So nice that former big oil executive and Trump toady Rex Tillerson proves once and for all that he has a heart of gold.
2080 2018-03-22 19:38:03 oil memes are the only memes I enjoy
2081 2018-03-22 19:38:00 No es evasión, es peor. No ingreso las retenciones que nos hizo a cada uno de nosotros. Evadir es no pagar impuestos propios. Oil actuó como agente de retención y se quedó con el dinero retenido a cada persona que cargo combustible.
2082 2018-03-22 19:38:00 So there was me thinking the boiler had broke, turns out thieving gypsies have been round and robbed all the oil from the tank again. Another £600 down thanks to the lowlife scum. Fucking vermin
2083 2018-03-22 19:37:56 I don't think you're grasping this...

I'm not trying to "solve" violence, I'm saying it can't be solved.

You can "win" all you want, but then what? What happens next?

What happens to that other country that is losing, but also providing you your oil, 100 years later?
2084 2018-03-22 19:37:46 I guess not everywhere is as kumbaya as the oil industry. 
2085 2018-03-22 19:37:45 Memos coming forward revealing the purpose of Iraq invasion for oil control.
2086 2018-03-22 19:37:43 Buy the Kirkland Hazelnut Spread instead. It's $5 cheaper, contains more, tastes better, and is free of palm oil
2087 2018-03-22 19:37:42 I prefer them cooked - especially roasted. They get a completely different flavour. Add a bit of oil and have them in a salad. Kate #AldiEasterFeasters

2089 2018-03-22 19:37:16 You had contempt for BP Oil spill in the gulf
you ought to have contempt for the In-justice system or Medical Maintenance System or even being made a corporate entity but those are reasonable 'contempt's'
'Rapid-Fire Liar' is a ricochet. I am waiting for the music score.

2092 2018-03-22 19:37:04 Time for a oil change
2093 2018-03-22 19:37:02 Though would make for an impressive show as she fly's over head in a whirling dervish of oil and old ponyish curse words towing the sun behind XD
2094 2018-03-22 19:37:02 Reflexive partisanship. The left (initially Gore) thinks its an issue, therefore the right must not. Among other things, the right takes on a pro-oil stance. The oil companies support a pro-oil stance and contribute to the GOP, but that doesn't mean they believe the GOP's stance.
2095 2018-03-22 19:36:56 I know a country where people are eating mud cake because of Foreign Interference, Foreign Currency has replaced local currency, and the government is not allowed to tap in the vaste Oil Reserve or any natural resources to make Money to increase the GDP.
2096 2018-03-22 19:36:45 I watched. Total lies. Your sign said "dirty oil". Not "we are giving our oil away". Not "refine it here". Not "only if we spend the $ correctly". 

Your speech is pure spin, and easy to see through.

2101 2018-03-22 19:36:01 Here's a tip, don't eat patchouli oil. That shit might smell good but it is not pleasant in the mouth.
2102 2018-03-22 19:35:50 Snort olbas oil as often as possible - works like magic, you may beat infection without resorting to antibiotics
2103 2018-03-22 19:35:46 Just applying a bit of oil to some inner areas.
2104 2018-03-22 19:35:26 This adorable lot have now learnt a full body massage routine to enjoy at home with their parents  Little Belle is clearly in her element during a massage, she loves every minute of it! I hope you’ve got a good stock of oil at home mummies 
2105 2018-03-22 19:35:15 If properly done. Tea tree oil can burn skin and cause scarring if not diluted correctly. That’s just scary knowing that people are inserting TTO into a sensitive area

2109 2018-03-22 19:34:37 Oil/Gas BC export gig of 90 ‘/, is being quoted a lot in Alberta. NDP Premier Notley has mentioned restricting pipeline flo. Doubtful she would do it to BC NDP Govt but PC’s would. Ab has another Oil Upgrader under construction. Washington just shut 2 refineries down for repairs.
2110 2018-03-22 19:34:24 Yeah spinning cylinders and castor oil flying all over the place. She'll pass on that.
2111 2018-03-22 19:34:14 We are trying to stop the the use of unsustainable Palm Oil. We are not against Palm Oil production if it’s sustainable. This should not effect farmers if they are producing the goods sustainably.

2116 2018-03-22 19:33:51 Ur mom was telling my mom about the cbd oil my mom thought it was illegal and was telling me to keep it hidden 
2117 2018-03-22 19:33:50 Getting results...like putting an anti-pipeline activist on your oil sands advisory board @Tzeporah ....
You got played in your carbon tax= pipeline by the Liberals and now you have to do something to save face. Good luck!
2118 2018-03-22 19:33:37 Why 3 centuries?, is that how long the oil is going to last?
 
2119 2018-03-22 19:33:24 When your career is based on exploiting the environment for oil, which destroys said environment...for immense personal gain...that’s pretty mean-spirited
2120 2018-03-22 19:33:22 What I do is heat the oil in the skillet, add the dough, heat for a couple of mins, flip the dough, add the toppings then put it under the grill to melt the cheese. Kate #AldiEasterFeasters

2124 2018-03-22 19:32:53 I let my car get to 1% oil life and if that doesn’t say anything about how I live my life I don’t know what does.
2125 2018-03-22 19:32:22 How is the data miner being on Moscow's payroll not pertinent?  How is Cambridge Analytica briefing a Russian oil company on how to use the mined data to disrupt elections not pertinent?
2126 2018-03-22 19:32:21 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2127 2018-03-22 19:32:07 He missed the kindhearted conviviality of the global oil and gas industry.
2128 2018-03-22 19:32:03 I know the science behind it but I spent thousands seeing multiple estheticians 15 or so years ago then as soon as I stated using coconut oil 2x weekly boom 3 weeks in skin completely cleared. I do what works for me and I suggest others do what works for them and be great

Yo ass use bacon grease as beard oil 

You let other men braid your beard as community service
2134 2018-03-22 19:31:11 We will be fair, just, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2135 2018-03-22 19:31:02 This just happened to me and i used tea tree oil on my breakouts. They were gone within a couple days. Its worth a shot
2136 2018-03-22 19:31:01 Anyone else proper buzz over different smelly oil wax burners or ...ye just me thought so lol

2140 2018-03-22 19:30:51 Ive been at this dealership for almost 3 hours just for a oil change . This why i dont like coming here
2141 2018-03-22 19:30:39 LADOL doesn't count, it operates in the oil and gas sector. Plus Amazon does not have a Luxembourg warehouse so that's probably down to a subcontractor already. Plus you're ignoringg the volume argument, do we do enough in volume to warrant our own warehouse?
2142 2018-03-22 19:30:31 Oh pleeze, where was Tillerson’s integrity when he arrogantly believed that his experience as an oil executive would make him a perfect fit for SOS? Where was his integrity when he ignored advice from senior diplomats or when he gutted the State Dept? #GoodRiddance
2143 2018-03-22 19:30:23 It's essential that when the oil in your car is being changed, that it is properly disposed of off. Do not pour the oil in a drain, or in your toilet. It will wreak havoc on your septic system.
2144 2018-03-22 19:30:17 I think Tillerson got the last laugh .... He was the head of Exxon for years ... Pretty sure a well placed call from him killed Putin's dreams of drilling for Artic oil ... and those buyers of the 19.5% stake in Rosneft?  Also screwed.
2145 2018-03-22 19:30:16 Rexxon Valdez Tillerson, the man responsible for unfettered greed and despoiling the planet with his 3 decades in Big Oil was *too liberal* for Trump. A man who raped the earth and built his fortune on pollution and misery was simply not extreme enough for Trump. Grok That.
2146 2018-03-22 19:30:13 OIL DIFF: 4.71 -> 4.77
2147 2018-03-22 19:30:08 No where near a socialist. A socialist would increase the corporate tax rate, provide universal day care, pharmacare, be AGAINST oil pipelines, for electoral reform, for non-Harper CO2 emissions targets. He's not. He aligns with Harper on ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
2148 2018-03-22 19:29:56 Yes love a Hawaiian pizza. Best topping though is pinenuts, sultanas, red onion and garlic oil:-) #AldiEasterFeasters
2149 2018-03-22 19:29:48 Maybe premier Hogan should stop slandering Alberta oil before we cut off the taps
2150 2018-03-22 19:29:35 You're missing my point. Whether it's diluted or finished oil it's going to the coast no matter what. Stopping the pipeline "stops" nothing. I expect the media to start reporting on this soon.
2151 2018-03-22 19:29:30 Join the military? Why? So you can murder for an education? Or oil? Or 1%? Our country has NEVER been challenged. Iraq and Afghanistan cost $2 trillion. This is ludicrous. Its bad management. Congress must resign. They are the problem
2152 2018-03-22 19:29:18 Oil and  Israel.
2153 2018-03-22 19:29:16 Corps don't "donate like people"....they expect support for their best interests (products) in turn for their advertising $$$.  People donate their own money to candidates that support their best interests...over corporations like Koch Bros oil industry
2154 2018-03-22 19:29:15 @realDonaldTrump World’s last true wilderness - Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or ANWR - Trump says he does not think including drilling leases at the ANWR in the GOP tax bill was "a big deal" -- BUT AN OIL BUSINESS FRIEND "TALKED ME INTO IT." ? WTF!!!!!????$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!?????
2155 2018-03-22 19:29:14 i got one of those peel off masks today strictly because of the satisfaction of seeing everything come out of me & i can’t wait to open my pores up to even more dirt & oil but it’s definitely gonna be worth it :D
2156 2018-03-22 19:29:03 Excuse me boss I got castor oil in my eyes and it burns can I go home ?

2160 2018-03-22 19:28:47 Another dumb move by this POTUS... assuming that an older white male,  multimillionaire, who struck it rich in the oil industry would not have tact, dignity, morals, care for this country & its citizens & more....characteristics 45 will NEVER possess. #RexTillerson
2161 2018-03-22 19:28:45 The early attempts to convert a big boy to oil firing were unsuccessful. A later conversion was tried successfully on the Challenger, #3965. Big Boy 4014 will be oil fired using experience gained from #3965 and will probably have an improved burner.

2164 2018-03-22 19:28:31 INDEED. No billionaires (yet Rex Tillerson was declared a 'Friend of the Russian ppl') for his dealings w/'Rosneft' (Russia's biggest oil co.). EVEN REX's willing to put THAT on the line to do what was right for the U.S.A. over his pocketbook. AT LEAST I can respect him for THAT
2165 2018-03-22 19:28:27 @martintetaz @argecono @BonelliOK / China (under the direction of the Chinese Elders) would lead the world to return the gold-standard with their de facto gold-backed Yuan.
The Yuan-backed Oil Futures Contracts would begin trading on Mon. March 26.

2173 2018-03-22 19:27:42 Holy cow my new car made a trip nearly 10k before it needed an oil change
2174 2018-03-22 19:27:25 Something about the midnight oil?
2175 2018-03-22 19:27:17 Well he does it to keep the oil on his tail feathers, Ofc. That way when he does inevitably in up in water he can float instead of drown. Lol!
2176 2018-03-22 19:27:10 Well, I looked-up the 2,322 page bill and I’m working backwards (end to beginning), and there’s a lot more in there then you promote!  FCC changes with Broadband & Wireless, Pass-thru tax goodies for the rich, lots of added stuff about Native American Tribes, oil, ...
2177 2018-03-22 19:27:08 When is someone going to help these people understand that pipelines are the safest and most environmentally friendly way to move oil? I would love to have a breakdown of how much oil consumption each of these hypocritical idealists use per year.
2178 2018-03-22 19:26:54 Horgan taxes our workers paychecks & gives it $ to foreign oil & gas companies as subsidies who also defer tax untill they make a profit 20 years from now ? Maybe.
2179 2018-03-22 19:26:28 That doesn’t shock me at all. I tried it in Texas, but it was too “heavy,” so I had jojoba and almond oil on hand -I didn’t even need it, just a spa treat, but here I’m dying.

2187 2018-03-22 19:25:35 Oil he would know of. It was different yet it was soothing unlike the salt when he felt it

“Your wounds are not the cause of battle, are they”

Asked the healer as she was pourin the oil on his wounds
2188 2018-03-22 19:25:33 Yeah I'd be down
2189 2018-03-22 19:25:28 I just pretend life’s an oil painting, it ain’t so bad
2190 2018-03-22 19:25:22 Just ordered Scott’s birthday gift! A oil painting of Him, Dylan and myself at the Indy 500 last year!
2191 2018-03-22 19:25:07 I guess. It’s just that, as an outsider, I live in Canada, I watch this stuff going on in a country that I love, and spend a great deal of time travelling in, and I don’t get this family stuff...it’s like a throw back to the old west and big cattle and oil families owning it all.
2192 2018-03-22 19:25:02 Some chefs use it as well as things like sesame oil n stuff. I don’t buy it but it’s a thing
2193 2018-03-22 19:24:48 YES THANK YOU. I said if someone asks you to pass some seasoning you don’t generally give them olive oil.
2194 2018-03-22 19:24:43 Just curious, how accurate were the PC’S budget predictions during the time of unstable oil royalty incomes?

Sure would have been wise to put aside 30% of royalty incomes to help the province through the inevitable drop, which we are now experiencing.
2195 2018-03-22 19:24:25 You won't believe this but i use olive oil. Just a few drops and rub it in especially around my fingertips. Lol, I discovered how beautifully it moisturises by accident - I was making Greek pastries
2196 2018-03-22 19:24:20 The healer gave a reassuring smile and a gentle nod. Being given the task of tending to his wounds was enough for her to begin

Of course she even had a medicinal pouch with what she needed

She would then pour an oil over his wounds that had salt on them. It wasn’t a regular -
2197 2018-03-22 19:24:20 I like to make mine this way: smash avocado, squeeze some fresh lemon, add a pinch of salt then spread on toast. Top with Zaatar or Everything Bagel seasoning, or hot sauce! You could also add sprouts and t
ruffle oil like a cafe does here.
2198 2018-03-22 19:24:20 What about all the victims of UK and US terrorism?
Hundreds of thousands bombed into the dark ages in the pursuit of minerals and oil.
Still happening today.
That's what breeds the retaliatory attacks
2199 2018-03-22 19:24:18 Wahl - their hair clippers are very durable, last almost forever especially if you actually bother to clean / oil them (which I don't lol)
2200 2018-03-22 19:23:55 22:22 msk @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. So.. March 26 will be start of smth... yuan crude oil market will open.
2201 2018-03-22 19:23:54 Very well put. It's one thing to set up a protected commercial venue, where the risk for the oil producer is three months of sales that would have happened anyway, it's another thing to hold a fiat currency of anything different from a set democracy. Or gold in hand.

in bed, having been laid up with Castor’s oil on the Parrish’s syrup (the night we will remember) for to share our hard suite of affections
2204 2018-03-22 19:23:25 Sitting at my car dealership getting the oil changed in my car.
They've got a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk sitting in the showroom.
I want it so bad!!!
2205 2018-03-22 19:23:17 «The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.»

2207 2018-03-22 19:23:15 He’s not going to let any of these pipelines actually get built. Your idiot friends in BC are breaking the law to stop it and he’s just watching them. Would rather import oil from Saudi than get ours to tidal water.
2208 2018-03-22 19:23:09 I love opportunities for you to make fun of me, it's great
2209 2018-03-22 19:23:08 It does make sense though. There's evidence even before this that they take the risks seriously, raising oil platforms and the like. It may well be that denialism has its roots in the GOP itself, and the oil companies support them for business reasons but think they're wrong.
2210 2018-03-22 19:23:07 *TWO-THIRDS OF #OIL GLUT IS GONE, AL-FALIH SAYS: BBG. #OOTT
2211 2018-03-22 19:22:59 it ALLOWED china to make deals for oil. i'm not saying oil was the primary deliberation for the war. i agree it was because of the israel lobby. i'm saying post-war the neocons sat by and allowed china to do this; boomers and china are two additional victors of the war.
2212 2018-03-22 19:22:55 me
2213 2018-03-22 19:22:49 Why are these insiders creating an issue where there is none.  Many Oil fans a little frustrated he's not getting better opportunities, but rates so low on scale of Oiler current season problems and fan gripes.
2214 2018-03-22 19:22:45 Oil prices are lower 30 - 60 $ / barrel instead of Musharraf and Zardari time which was more than 100 $ / barrel.
Where is foreign exchange flows ?
2215 2018-03-22 19:22:42 @ovalledkimberly We hear you there. Did you get the oil changed yet?
2216 2018-03-22 19:22:41 Did shell have oil interest in iraq war ??
Well it seems so.
2217 2018-03-22 19:22:23 Nice try, you petro-lobby douchebags. The Deplorables you're trying to reach out to can't even vote in the local elections. Your days are numbered. Soon, you'll be laying off oil and gas workers by the thousands. 
2218 2018-03-22 19:22:08 Turns out the estimate I got was the high end, so fingers crossed. Basically we are gonna get the cat this surgery and hope we can get by without more heating oil in April is the plan ... (we have half electric heat)
2219 2018-03-22 19:21:57 In Angola, the civil war ended in 2002 and right after that came the  liberalization of the economy, influx of foreign investment, and an oil  boom that lasted till 2013. But yes, some of the same factors at play.
2220 2018-03-22 19:21:56 All Russia has left is oil.  No one wants or needs it.  They made a tactical mistake of not producing wheat, veggies, etc..., hence have to import everything.  They are LOOSERS.
2221 2018-03-22 19:21:38 More than 100% of the observed global warming in the past 100 years is due to the increase in IR absorptivity of the atmosphere (obs warming > natural cooling). More than 100% of the CO2 increase is due to the combustion of coal, oil, and gas (CO2 rise is 2x FF combustion).

2223 2018-03-22 19:21:32 We removed Iran's elected secular leader which led to the Mullahs taking over. We're not good at this. So let the people of Iran decide. We really don't care abt them, we care about the world's Oil Supply which Ron Paul had the guts to say when no one else dared, except Kucinich
2224 2018-03-22 19:21:32 Thank you @SenatorTomUdall for rejecting hundreds of extreme #DirtyBudget policies that would threaten our communities health government to sell out our iconic outdoors to oil and gas interests. #Nopoisinpills #DirtyBudget
2225 2018-03-22 19:21:16 Oops.  
You mean kitty litter and paper towels are still pretty much "it" for oil spill clean up...
2226 2018-03-22 19:21:10 People really think Bahi cosmetics just snuck some cannabis into their products and don’t realize hemp seed oil can be sooooo good for their skin and body.
2227 2018-03-22 19:21:00 But but environmental groups don’t care about us buying oil from countries with blatant human rights abuses... no, that’s not their agenda... 
2228 2018-03-22 19:20:52 Anything under an hour I just use water. Maybe some green tea with mct oil.
2229 2018-03-22 19:20:28 If you are ever frying thinly sliced shallots (set it low, for like 20 mins so it doesn’t burn), keep the oil and make a salad dressing with it. Shallot oil, champ vinegar, Dijon, s&p = galaxy brain
2230 2018-03-22 19:20:26 @TheSoulbrother   DON’T waste your time with hemp CBD.  Snake oil.   Get the real stuff from cannabis.  Trust me, I know.
2231 2018-03-22 19:20:26 Vitamin e oil, soap and water, and coconut oil
2232 2018-03-22 19:20:15 Me too. was veg'n for a while then mostly low-fat white meat. Even olive oil would go rancid from underuse in my kitchen. Still got NAFLD. No sign of pre-diabetes but I 'blew a tyre' to be Dx with T2DM.

2236 2018-03-22 19:19:58 Der er to, bizart komplementære, problemer i det her:
1) Varm luft på stylter (vækkelsesprædikanter, snake oil o.l.)
2) Djævelsk effektive teknikker, som hverken kunderne (fx Mai Mercado eller borgmestre) eller brugerne/ofrene har en chance for at gennemskue
2237 2018-03-22 19:19:50 White rice: 1cup rice to 3/4 cup water. Add a table spoon of oil and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil. Add rice. Boil uncovered on medim-high until the water is almost dry. Then, cover and lower the heat to medium low for 8-10 minutes.  Fluf w/ fork and enjoy!

(1) HEARD OF cbd oil
(2) TRIED   cbd oil for yourself
(3) TRIED   cbd for their pets
2239 2018-03-22 19:19:39 the squeaky wheel gets the oil and thats sad
2240 2018-03-22 19:19:37 Then oil is too high since deal w Saudi & gas prices rise
Then interest rates too high to buy house
Then tariffs raise prices of everything
Then stocks crash so 401k gets raided
Then tax revenue used to pay interest on debt so can't help recover from recession
2241 2018-03-22 19:19:23 Both are great in my opinion. The point I guess I was making is Venezuela was a rich nation that nationalized it's oil supply and subsequently ruined it's economy. Nationalization surely ruins quality of life.
2242 2018-03-22 19:19:11 nope. add some tomatoes and mozzarella oil and seasoning #IssaWrap
2243 2018-03-22 19:18:58 sometimes i start cooking and instinctively pour oil into a pan. it can be anything and i just start oiling up. i then stare at the pan filled with oil and realize there is no need for it to make cereal. i now have a pan filled with oil for no reason thanks a lot
2244 2018-03-22 19:18:57 Not the period when the USGov did everything it could to stifle US oil production and help the Russian economy? Or let Russia take Crimea? Or let Russia set up military bases in Syria to prop up a butcher who used chemical weapons? Or let them take control of 20% of our uranium?
2245 2018-03-22 19:18:55 Shame
2246 2018-03-22 19:18:44 Now he can go back to sucking out the worlds oil for Exxon
2247 2018-03-22 19:18:41 30% OFF in Booth ASM.  Cast iron skillets, vintage toys, old tools, crates, insulators, oil cans -- too much to name!
2248 2018-03-22 19:18:37 I got a face oil yesterday and holy shit best decision so far.
2249 2018-03-22 19:18:35 Using caloric density, I'd say 3 - your samples are drowning in oil.  If you use the whole food model, 14-30.
2250 2018-03-22 19:18:33 He can’t return to oil. He signed a 2 year conflict of interest clause.
2251 2018-03-22 19:18:32 I hope everyone loves oil memes now
2252 2018-03-22 19:18:25 How did us invading Iraq prevent China from making deals about oil?
2253 2018-03-22 19:18:09 I never knew tweeting three pictures of oil memes would blow up as much as it did
2254 2018-03-22 19:17:50 How much money did he lose leaving Exxonmobil?  What was his share of the Exxonmobil /Russia oil deal that did not get off the ground because of the Sanctions? ?? I'm just asking

A California federal judge overseeing allegations that oil companies are liable for Bay Area global warming-related infrastructure costs heard a 5 hr tutorial on climate science Weds.
2259 2018-03-22 19:16:57 It’s called “flush production” where you could , if required, drain the oil that accumulated at the bottom of the producer well. So it’s a very much doable thing. Opinion my own.
2260 2018-03-22 19:16:57 The company runs Omega-3 fish oil. But I'm in the corporate office.
2261 2018-03-22 19:16:54 LOL I'm surprised people relate lmao
2262 2018-03-22 19:16:50 I get the mask from Whole Foods or amazon . I got my witch hazel and aloe gel from Walmart and she’s butter and tea tree oil from the hair store lol. The witch hazel does wonders for dark spots!
2263 2018-03-22 19:16:49 It would be a difficult project, but rewarding. You’d need a really strong level of anonymity built in. The funding - well, yes, an interesting question. It would be a good sign of a healthy ofsted that commissioned research to make its inspection system resistant to snake oil.
2264 2018-03-22 19:16:32 everyone is different but i always like to recommend natural/no chemical bs cleansers + chemical exfoliators not scrubs + a few drops of tea tree oil mixed w rosehip oil as a moisturizer.. literally turned my skin around compared to when i was using harsh drugstore acne shit 
2265 2018-03-22 19:16:30 @POTUS the USA Oil Refinery Pipelines throughout the USA have been safety-compromised with mixed materials, replacement patches in repaired lines for 50 years; mostly foreign bought pipe...extremely dangerous conditions exist and need attention.

2277 2018-03-22 19:14:23 Vanc area gets 90’/, of its Oil/Gas from Alberta in a pipeline operating @ capacity. Twinning the existing pipeline would help supply meet demand & benefit Canada. The risk is  Alberta has an Election soon & the party that offers to restrict pipeline oil to BC will get Elected.
2278 2018-03-22 19:14:20 America has more oil than it knows what to do with....it has to muzzle its production just to keep the market from being flooded.

2280 2018-03-22 19:14:03 Came in for an oil change & my car needs so much more work. Apparently my brakes are horrible 
2281 2018-03-22 19:13:58 I can't wait for this treasonous POS to be exposed for the greedy prick he is. His $120M severance deal from Exxon wasn't enough for him. He had to pursue a grand oil deal with Vlad and add a few more zeroes to his bank acct. #OilDealFAIL. Fuck 'em both.
2282 2018-03-22 19:13:52 Make money investing in oil!  Massive tax advantages and monthly cash flow is a much better alternative than investing in markets in which fundamentals are meaningless.
2283 2018-03-22 19:13:45 He gave me $60 to get my oil changed but it’s only 30 
2284 2018-03-22 19:13:41 Tonnes of room on board for oil cans too 
2285 2018-03-22 19:13:37 Sometimes skin overproduced oil when it’s dried out by soap.
2286 2018-03-22 19:13:35 you can make them yourself. just slice a potato and bake it w/out oil, then season it w/ salt and voila healthy version of potato chips

2299 2018-03-22 19:12:12 Resonance: molecules of similar vibrations tend to accumulate together. If you pour oil in water, you'll find the oil droplets tend to accumulate together. Different oils (different molecular structures and therefore different vibrations) accumulate in different ways

2310 2018-03-22 19:10:59 I live in BC, the gas prices are brutal $1.54/liter today.  We should be buying oil from AB not shipping it up the coast at a higher price from the US. This is just stupid. Put the pipeline in ASAP & put some unused BC refineries back online for more jobs.#bcpoli

2314 2018-03-22 19:10:07 Meanwhile eastern Canada ships in its oil and pipes it across the region. It’s bought from some despicable countries with sub-par environmental standards. A kind of virtue insanity.

2319 2018-03-22 19:09:25 His photos really caught that. The Aneth oil field was a big find, with a complicated financial history. I had read about the history, and was fascinated to see how the oil extraction was woven into the working landscape. My pics, not so good.

2323 2018-03-22 19:08:59 Wait what?  The koch brothers fund conservatives in Canada?  While also simultaneously being accused by conservatives of funding NGOs to stop Canadian oil from getting expensive for them? I can’t keep up with the conspiracies anymore
2324 2018-03-22 19:08:53 I record everything in @CRONoMeter . Plant CHN from soy, Lupini, pea, baru nuts, hemp. I never have a hard time getting enough. I sometimes use MCT but keto adapted so not often. I take algal oil for O3. I take D3/K2 which I recommend for all of my patients.

2328 2018-03-22 19:08:19 I wanted to eat dinner rolls after work at Texas Roadhouse before my oil change but, they don't open until 1600. I'm not surprised but majorly disappointed
2329 2018-03-22 19:07:58 I do like the dark popcorn the best and that's what I tried with olive oil. Just didn't work right. I'm okay with olive oil but I don't like olives so that might be the thing.
2330 2018-03-22 19:07:55 Iy is a LEGALLY APPROVED project. May should be ashamed of her actions as she could not do squat without oil - she lives on an ISLAND.

2332 2018-03-22 19:07:34 @PadstowTIC Back home from a Padstow holiday last Saturday - our healthy Labrador’s been very unwell with sickness/diarrhoea since. Think she may have eaten a blob of palm oil from the beach. Symptoms seem to fit with what we read. Vet has put her on antibiotics. Any advice?
2333 2018-03-22 19:07:26 Went to get my oil changed and the dude roasted me for being a Louisville fan 
2334 2018-03-22 19:07:18 I’ll bring the lube & oil!! Who’s in???
2335 2018-03-22 19:07:10 Injuries, kicker issues and bad team building decisions were what needed to be accounted for. Instead it was coach bashing and oil painting burning.
2336 2018-03-22 19:07:06 no, i'm talking about china slurping up all the oil through private contracts so they can keep expanding for the sake of boomers' cheap luxury. i never mentioned Big Oil Petrodollars or Blood for Oil.
2337 2018-03-22 19:06:57 It’s not finding public employees salaries, it’s the state taxing oil producers at a proper level. The revenue problems in Oklahoma are directly related to a low tax burden. The choices to raise revenue are either tax the people or tax industry the same way every other state does
2338 2018-03-22 19:06:40 YOUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!!!   You are so two faced!!!  You used Chinese steel to build pipes that then leaked oil all over sacred land and water!!!!  Do everyone a favour and just die!!

2349 2018-03-22 19:05:11 I just remembered someone asked what my favorite seasoning was and they told me theirs was olive oil. Is olive oil even unto a actual seasoning?
2350 2018-03-22 19:05:03 KSA+Algeria+Iran have sold (90+30+50) of their inventories starting Nov15. But shale kept growing because the contango allowed the US firms to get better pricing for future oil. Because the FCF models support it. So they wanted to force the market into backwardation.
2351 2018-03-22 19:04:57 The man who did this to her should have his balls burnt in boiling oil ... shame on such men ..
2352 2018-03-22 19:04:52 I don’t think funding public employee salaries through an extremely volatile industry is a sustainable long term plan. Remember, teachers aren’t the only people hurting from our revenue problems. How many oil and gas employees reside in Oklahoma?
2353 2018-03-22 19:04:51 2 hour wait for an oil change!!  Sheesh!!
2354 2018-03-22 19:04:50 Don't skip moisturizer, I used to do this and found it made my oily skin worse. Also using specific mattifying products made it worse, try oil free moisturizers they don't really make oily skin oilier x
2355 2018-03-22 19:04:49 Yea --- right along with Oil in the 70's, silver in the 80's and Maine Lobster in 2032.

2357 2018-03-22 19:04:33 Instead of oil, its vast pools of cheap labor, and access to western markets.  As the labor gets more expensive so customers go elsewhere (Vietnam, Africa,...) may also collapse?
2358 2018-03-22 19:04:28 OMG, there are about 800 military bases on foreign soil and you are involved in seven active wars and an unknown number of covert ones! This is not about defense or terror but is about oil theft and strategic positioning for more, bigger wars. Cut military spending!
2359 2018-03-22 19:04:25 Do you use any oil diffusers?
2360 2018-03-22 19:04:23 i use bio oil, you’re beautiful just the way you are tho ilyyy

2364 2018-03-22 19:04:16 The oil industry wakes up every day to new regulations. They don’t view them as “opportunities.”  Nevertheless, those who invested in blending probably already got a ROI. It wasn’t practical for all merchants to invest in blending.
2365 2018-03-22 19:04:14 I liked it! But I pretty much like olive oil for everything. Including chocolate cake!
2366 2018-03-22 19:03:54 I'm not thrilled about the taste of olive oil on popcorn. I have tried it before. It's an acquired taste.
2367 2018-03-22 19:03:53 Cooking can be  that stressful sometimes. I can change clothes 4 times to fry egg. 
Cloth 1 - to assemble the egg
Cloth 2 - break the egg and add ingredients
Cloth 3 - heat oil and fry
Cloth 4 - serve with new cloth.

It's not easy bro

2383 2018-03-22 19:01:47 So you’re hedging your bets on unrecoverable oil in the event of a spill? Bitumen can’t be recovered. And current spill response is completely unable to recover bitumen.
2384 2018-03-22 19:01:46 Zoe, villages gone, oil/gas fields shut in, infrastructures disappeared. Quake went for 3 minutes & caused tyres to shake off wheel rims. C Squadron (my son’s a flight Engineer) can’t believe the devastation. No news coverage!

2394 2018-03-22 19:00:57 If you think they want to do it becos it's a more efficient, ur missing the point. Add the missing Z-axis ("Bank balance of state officials running oil company") & you'll understand

Have you ever used CBD oil to help your SC?  

If so, what was your experience.  If not, why did you choose to refrain?

2402 2018-03-22 19:00:06 There's no need to replace the air filters as often as the oil filter, but the air filter can collect dust, dirt, and other particles that can damage your vehicle's fuel injectors and should be replaced every 20,000 miles.

2404 2018-03-22 18:59:39 Did oil companies knowingly fund campaigns of disinformation and junk science to sway public opinion and prevent legislation on GHGs? If climate change weren’t politicized then we very likely would have used less oil, yes.

2406 2018-03-22 18:59:33 It’s easy to come up with $600,000,000 for raises, it’s called raisin the gross production tax. Instead out the legislature taxes money from the producers and gives them the lowest GPT of any oil producing state.

2427 2018-03-22 18:56:22 This is one of the things that has been keeping me up at night post-Harvey. I have zero faith in the info that has been shared by regulators or the chemical/oil & gas companies. Im astonished by the lax regulations in TX. A disaster is unfolding under our noses.
2428 2018-03-22 18:56:08 ridiculous the advisories have to state items that should be regarded as almost beyond accepted use, like tyres tread depth, or oil leak, or brake efficiency down, saying a bike has been modified wtf....if i was still in the job he wouldnt be....
2429 2018-03-22 18:56:04 As oil spill responders we were to contain an oil spill but we forgot to go along wit all equipments.

2430 2018-03-22 18:55:58 This is just an eyeball recipe, but basically, wash and blot dry the kale (I had a packaged bag of it), and put it in a bowl for seasoning. I added 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 large minced garlic clove and the juice of 1/2 lemon. Then, a dash of salt, a sprinkle of peri peri...

2434 2018-03-22 18:55:37 Big plastic, big oil, cargo ships, and cow farms are the biggest contributors to the downfall of our environment, right? Except for the fact that it comes down to all humans who allowed this to happen, myself included.

2438 2018-03-22 18:55:10 Fishers is on the decline. I highly doubt that industry will see 2B this year. The mitigations that will be in place as well greatly offset the risk of catastrophic damage. And... not one tanker spill with an oil cargo to date in our waters.

2441 2018-03-22 18:54:29 From my experience, and we have only their 'oil' like products and tinctures that vary from 2-12% of THC - the pills got revoked because they leaked - it's impotent overpriced garbage. But I see that they sell whole range of products, just not my cup of tea
2442 2018-03-22 18:54:10 Charge items that cost 1.00. buy one every month and pay it off every month. Make them mail paper statements.

2456 2018-03-22 18:52:29 I am also responsible for my bills. It just happens that the economy in N BC is heavily reliant on resources.
Not sure why you find it hard to believe that we are on the same side of the "oil tankers and oil spills" issue.
Clean, safe and responsible. That's what we demand.
2457 2018-03-22 18:52:18 If COMEX/NYMEX = 22 bbls/oz & CNY is 30 bbls/oz, means either oil up, gold up (ie USD down) or gold flat, oil down (USD up, China's current account surplus up).  CNY oil contract means China can manage current acct, means cannot have a BoP crisis bc can print CNY for oil.
2458 2018-03-22 18:52:16 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their breakfast gave them diarrhea

2475 2018-03-22 18:48:35 Disgusting we have this man as Major capital city of such a great country #KhanOut 
2476 2018-03-22 18:48:27 And we shouldn't be just talking about the CDA right now in relation to Big Tech. We need to be talking about using the Anti Trust laws against these democracy distorting monopolies. Facebook is the new Standard Oil.

2480 2018-03-22 18:47:37 If  CNY is convertible under the oil contract( i have read it will be ) & gets some volume, then when combined with CNY gold contracts in HK/Dubai, China will have the ability to control international trade value of USD via mgmt of gold/oil ratio
2481 2018-03-22 18:47:30 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2482 2018-03-22 18:47:29 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2483 2018-03-22 18:47:27 Everyone who uses oil and gas products, which includes plastics.

The goal is no one would want to pay, and thus that would end this stupid debate.
2484 2018-03-22 18:47:24 Hurns can still gain separation.  Dez couldn't separate oil and water.

2497 2018-03-22 18:45:37 I'm so glad you found the oil.
Its beyond inhumane that we demonize a plant like cannabis.
2498 2018-03-22 18:45:25 I think you are severely incorrect about the oil sands generating less money that fishing and tourism.
2499 2018-03-22 18:44:52 ( Only Levitical priests were permitted access. They went into the Holy Place to perform regular duties: changing the lamp oil, the bread of the presence and to make daily offerings. )

2507 2018-03-22 18:44:34 I’m doing an oil change on my car and my neighbor came up to me.

Him: $80?? That’s a lot of chicken wings

Lmao

Yes, YOU might be allergic but it isn't their responsibility to warn you about YOUR allergies, you obviously know about
2509 2018-03-22 18:44:12 This comes from Baghdad. Erbil is largely silent, but surely agrees with this. However they do sell oil through Turkey.
2510 2018-03-22 18:44:10 So? We need oil, Exxonmobil provides that. He was a good CEO.
2511 2018-03-22 18:44:07 I get it: a dramatic change from the oil industry, which was built on free hug coupons.
2512 2018-03-22 18:44:04 “This can be a very mean-spirited town.”—Rex Tillerson, today. I feel sorry for the oil billionaire turned Trump dish rag, but his legacy will mess up our children’s future. #climatechange
2513 2018-03-22 18:44:02 Try not to wash your face if you don't have to, cleanse with witch hazel and then put mullein oil on (they sell ones for ear infections but it's the same shit and it works wonders) it can contain garlic which makes it smell but garlic is good for the skin too!!
2514 2018-03-22 18:44:00 Alright guys I know I’m *way* late to the party but I’m obsessed with argan oil. I use the ish on my skin my nails and hair. I even put it on my eyebrows bc why not.

2519 2018-03-22 18:42:53 My instant pot is great for rice. I rinse the rice 1st to get rid of unwanted starch, then 1C of water to 1C of rice, 1tsp of your fav oil for each cup of rice, so rice doesn’t stick & it adds subtle flavor. W/ white rice use rice button for brown rice: 22 to 24 minutes. Enjoy
2520 2018-03-22 18:42:31 Facts and Trumpsters do not mix well...a bit like oil and water

2522 2018-03-22 18:42:14 @VinnieTortorich @AnnaVocino hi guys finally ordered 3L tin, and it’s great stuf. I was expecting it to bite/burn like good California oil does. This is smoother. Do you agree? Is that bite something I’ve gotten used to but not necessarily desired?
2523 2018-03-22 18:42:08 Natural Beauty Tip for Dandruff:- 

Mix 1 tbsp of lemon juice with 5 tbsp of coconut oil and then apply the mixture on the scalp.

2532 2018-03-22 18:41:19 Natural Beauty Tip for Dandruff:- 

Use lukewarm almond oil, coconut oil or olive oil to massage your scalp to prevent dandruff. 

Leave it on the scalp overnight.
2533 2018-03-22 18:41:10 I some how feel it was a protectionist invasion to deny the 3rd Reich oil! Not to take over the Polish state! So, rather more tactical than an 'invasion'.i.e  the 'conclusion' was somewhat flawed, if not ridiculous.
2534 2018-03-22 18:40:40 Imma start oil pulling im so excited!

2547 2018-03-22 18:39:31 Don’t forget they’ll honor someone with an oil painting and call him the “Godfather” in August only to have “Hire Gruden” shirts and hats 2-3 months later. Glad to know I’m not the only one who isn’t on board with the movement.

2551 2018-03-22 18:38:52 I support this wholeheartedly. Still shocked that senate refused Lagos 1% returns on VAT generated just like oil producing states.
2552 2018-03-22 18:38:50 Kind've rich coming from a guy who, before taking the Sec of State job, was an oil exec who won "Friend of Russia" award.
2553 2018-03-22 18:38:47 I always put a little bit of olive oil in my pasta water because up yours is why because.
2554 2018-03-22 18:38:41 I mean, possibly? “I want an oil to help me with anger.” 

Nope. You need Jesus. 

“My kid throws things.” 

Because he’s a sinner. Let’s start there..
2555 2018-03-22 18:38:31 The oil memes 
2556 2018-03-22 18:38:24 Please talk to me I could have or should have a Scientist a good as well. Kill for try in to prove cannabis oil , Hemp oil helps fight cancer and more other ailments, conditions or Id say some Diagnoses including Pet Theory's

2563 2018-03-22 18:37:48 Green fresh oil.
2564 2018-03-22 18:37:47 It’s an oil that I use with my moisturizer and it’s been helping me with my scars too! It’s made for scars, stretch marks and uneven skin tone!
2565 2018-03-22 18:37:46 Seriously you don't think this is about the gold backing for oil in Yuan.

2569 2018-03-22 18:37:15 But here's the thing: Costco keeps MOVING THE AISLE CONTENTS, and they don't label them. It's their founding strategy to make you go up and down every aisle to find the olive oil and Advil you came in for.
2570 2018-03-22 18:36:45 I have a friend who was diagnosed with MS 20 years, she now cannot walk or support her own body weight

2579 2018-03-22 18:35:30 I didn’t want to order from Amazon. So I found another brand, Natural Force 100% pure MCT oil. Guess what? It’s not in a glass bottle as it looked, and it’s not 100% pure, it has 30% lauric acid. So now I’m returning that. Please, why not also sell through other sites? #mctoil

2583 2018-03-22 18:35:00 I hope you don't support this as this is the most beautiful region of Texas and further development would only destroy this region. Presidio is not a major entry and should not be. Leave this area alone. Oil/Gas Companies are already destroying this region.

2591 2018-03-22 18:34:19 His skin still may be a bit raw from the last visit. Be sure he gets booked in the boiling oil suite this time.
2592 2018-03-22 18:34:11 Now that we've determined vegetable oil, especially the partially hydrogenated kind, is mostly bullshit health wise, can McDonald's please go back to frying their french fries in beef tallow?
2593 2018-03-22 18:34:08 Maybe you could stop sending them off to die in foreign lands and focus on infrastructure rebuilding, teacher's salary, the VA hospital, diplomacy. You know, quit fighting wars for oil and start rebuilding our nation. Weird concept, I know.
2594 2018-03-22 18:34:01 Lots of steak spice for flavour. Basically black pepper and garlic. Coat the patties with vegetable oil to stop from sticking. They can be tricky to BBQ because they tend to stick to the grill.

2606 2018-03-22 18:32:35 We landed on the moon. We can look into space with flying telescopes. We can put a f-ing Tesla into orbit. We can extract oil from thousands of feet below the oceans. We can explore the bottom of said oceans in submersibles. But we can’t remove plastic garbage islands from them?

2609 2018-03-22 18:32:30 I'm getting my oil changed at Walmart and there is a lady sitting directly beside me FaceTiming her naked husband out loud. I'm very confused.
2610 2018-03-22 18:32:25 i know they don't teach you anything in high school, but please consider the strategic importance of controlling how, and how much, oil is divvied beyond its import for domestic use. you really think the two are mutually exclusive?
2611 2018-03-22 18:32:23 Oil prices are heading a lot higher

2617 2018-03-22 18:31:42 Peak oil at 2040-2050 .. 30+ years of growth then maybe a slow decline.

2619 2018-03-22 18:31:35 It may be the coconut oil in the cleanser-it’s a pretty heavy one. Even when I oil cleanse I use jojoba because it’s lighter, coconut oil was always too much for me

2702 2018-03-22 18:30:56 I saw earlier tweets stating that you were working on an issue with the vault storage for oil. I used to be able to store 12,000 barrels. After the recent upgrade, I can only store 8,000 barrels. Is there any eta on the fix for this glitch? Thank you.
2703 2018-03-22 18:30:54 guess what? That guy will be fired by his employers. He is destroying the big oil.
2704 2018-03-22 18:30:49 Ron Insana. LMAO! oil, early 16 at 27. " Well my bottom is 20, so no, 26.96, not the bottom." Cant believe he blew up in 37 minutes.

2709 2018-03-22 18:30:43 He didn't have to be blackmailed to run, his ego assures us of that. But if Putin helped him win the election & has the video, he could be blackmailed to do anything: ignore sanctions, for instance, help  Putin drill oil in Siberia, big $$$ under the table for both of them.
2710 2018-03-22 18:30:37 Ah, integrity. I thought he was talking about oil.

2726 2018-03-22 18:29:29 First time? If you go to a dealer, be prepared to negotiate and win a battle of attrition. A good rate for good credit score is 0-3%. Don't finance any stupid add-ons like oil changes or window tint. They look for ways to increase your interest.
2727 2018-03-22 18:29:28 This boy just pronounced argon oil, organ oil
2728 2018-03-22 18:29:24 To those saying go to Five Guys, I tried their fries and they were so greasy they left an oil slick on my kitchen table THROUGH the bag. 

Nope. Gross.

2731 2018-03-22 18:28:52 They're buying the water rights for almost nothing, putting it in plastic bottles made from oil, charging people more than the price of a gallon of gas for it, and have convinced people it's a good, smart thing to buy
2732 2018-03-22 18:28:42 Fuck Rex Tillerson.  When Exxon saw that their oil deal was not going through they pulled out!  That’s why Rex was there , greed, mo money by any means necessary.
2733 2018-03-22 18:28:41 Egg oil sounds yuck.
2734 2018-03-22 18:28:31 Agreed. No Biden,No Clinton. How about someone who will stand up to big oil and gas.

2736 2018-03-22 18:28:20 So "fracking" for LNG and the resultant potential for earthquakes is environmentally preferable to an oil pipeline.
2737 2018-03-22 18:28:11 Washington insiders announce new machine-learning neural network that can beat a chimpanzee at chess.

2738 2018-03-22 18:28:08 Been at pep boys for 2 hrs trying to get an oil change , should have done this shit myself.
2739 2018-03-22 18:28:00 No thanks. I'm not prepared to die for oil, power, foreign countries (US Israel) and imperialist ideas.
2740 2018-03-22 18:27:53 #ThrowBackMemories
I remembered in the 90’s when my Mum discovered SOYA BEAN, it was like Black Gold to her, crude oil? na it has noting on Soya Bean. Notting goes to waste; Soya Milk, Soya Powder, Soya Soup, Soya floor, Soya Bean Cake, Soya Oil etc.  #SoyaSavedLife. #Nigeria
2741 2018-03-22 18:27:45 Yeah Oil were due to win some games that’s for sure.
2742 2018-03-22 18:27:23 At 2:25pm  I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLK18) and USO on my software.
2743 2018-03-22 18:27:15 Actually, it's oil companies' fault for spreading decades of propaganda that directly contradict scientific findings, which in turn has slowed progress toward getting rid of fossil fuels.
2744 2018-03-22 18:27:13 Glad you're liking it!! It's nice to be able to control the oil/salt amounts, plus you get to burn some extra calories while cooking. Add to that the pride and confidence you feel when you put together a yummy meal...all good stuff!
2745 2018-03-22 18:27:12 Oil to help increase the volume of the beard or just to moisturize?
2746 2018-03-22 18:27:07 Ppl luv oil...
2747 2018-03-22 18:27:02 I think I might have once made one with vegetable oil and treacle and maybe beetroot. I’m clearly not auditioning to be Nigella.
2748 2018-03-22 18:26:51 Westworld premiers the same day that my castor oil gets here. Hopefully there will be a lot of growth and moisture that day.
2749 2018-03-22 18:26:47 Hey Pete so there still another 7 oil storage tanks on site when you left. How many barrels of oil do the hold :).. Sorry how many Hundreds of Barrels of Oil do they hold?

2752 2018-03-22 18:26:09 A sugar scrub is a concoction of oil (coconut, almond, jojoba, etc) coarse sugar, fine sugar, and possibly a fragrance. It’s meant to exfoliate and soften the skin. A salt scrub could also be used, but I find them to be drying, and they taste nasty.

2754 2018-03-22 18:25:47 I wish you were right but most of the Texans I know are still clinging to there guns, bibles and Trump, unfortunately they see Texas as an oil state and DT strong on oil.
2755 2018-03-22 18:25:38 I'm green. That's why I don't buy water that has been put into plastic bottles and trucked around the country. It takes far too much oil to move your water.

2768 2018-03-22 18:23:56 My professor told me that Data is the most powerful weapon& a commodity more valuable than oil, gold.A surgeon turning into a killer is more dangerous than an actual rogue.

But creation of 1% rich corrupt personalities in those mentioned nations who are trying to find formula to craft ways to dominate political stage through dirty money! its about business and OIL as number one target!
2786 2018-03-22 18:20:53 Today I learned coconut oil is unhealthy, my entire life is a lie
2787 2018-03-22 18:20:46 Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil. It was in a packet. Got it at Target. My locs feel so hydrated and soft
2788 2018-03-22 18:20:45 السلام عليكم موجودين ؟
2789 2018-03-22 18:20:26 Oil spills and trash are making oceans uninhabitable for marine life. Millions of fish are dying a year. There are no longer "plenty of fish in the sea." Pollution is ruining the Earth and your love life. Do with that what you will.
2790 2018-03-22 18:20:25 The guy with such a moral-high-ground. F@$k your feelings Rex. Go sell some oil and die on a huge pile of cash...... still won't make you happy.
2791 2018-03-22 18:20:10 Obama is a great snake oil salesman, other then that he is less then worthless.
2792 2018-03-22 18:19:49 Majority are puppets and it all boils down to money greed and oil 
2793 2018-03-22 18:19:38 We should all sue the oil and gas companies who lock us all into an energy market that is uncompetitive to alternatives because they bribe politicians to continue to unfairly subsidize oil and gas over other energy types!
2794 2018-03-22 18:19:37 Kurt, there are so many trade jobs here in oil/gas sector we may not have enough people for them. Maybe 2 yr trade school, tops. Welders and more can be making 6-figures quickly with some skill, motivation and gumption!
2795 2018-03-22 18:19:33 Your PTSD is chronic one, your members have suggested name change, shameless PDP that was borrowing to pay salary when oil was $100pb is complaining because they do not have access to our reserve which they depleted while in govt.
The pension thief has just been resentenced oooo
2796 2018-03-22 18:19:18 I drink oil
2797 2018-03-22 18:19:17 I had that in mind when I chose the gif from the list of crying ones
2798 2018-03-22 18:19:12 Best cooking oil
2799 2018-03-22 18:18:58 There shall be no free data. Besides, also, when data is the new 'oil', then we need to check the leaks. #CambridgeAnalytica
2800 2018-03-22 18:18:53 So, you could lose your integrity faster than, say, a tanker leaking thousands of gallons of oil?
Asking for a friend. Kthnxbye.
2801 2018-03-22 18:18:41 You are so right, yes Tillerson was a dreadful Secy of State, handpicked by Putin, but personally probably a nice guy, just one who sold his country out for Exxon oil rights in Russia.
2802 2018-03-22 18:18:40 we wash em, cut them in thin slices, spread some olive oil and eat with a fork. You're welcome
2803 2018-03-22 18:18:35 Cameroon is Africa's third largest producer of palm oil.

2807 2018-03-22 18:18:18 Nigeria's oil and gas sector is more open now as compare to the past on the account of NEITI's operations.......Waziri Adio
2808 2018-03-22 18:18:13 In this country is wrong to buy tomatoes without buying pepper

Madam-grinded pepper nko
Me-in fact Madam giv me red oil with kerosine Wetin ?
2809 2018-03-22 18:17:44 What a cretin.
You are a total comedian.

You have to spend millions extracting shale.

Huge amount of waste.

Oil reserves are just opened and that's it.

No pumping huge amounts of water from 1000s of trucks on a weekly basis.
2810 2018-03-22 18:17:34 That oil is the best!
2811 2018-03-22 18:17:30 I’ve been in a positive mood lately and mi nah mek ntn change that.

2813 2018-03-22 18:17:25 FYI. This is from a movie glorifying guns.
2814 2018-03-22 18:17:13 Don't you blaspheme about coconut oil...

2817 2018-03-22 18:16:32 I think we need to close that oil in Niger Delta let all these politicians get sense !
2818 2018-03-22 18:16:29 "And now everybody go piss some oil on an Indian burial ground. America bless God."
2819 2018-03-22 18:16:18 My favorite category of Crude Oil - #UpInSmoke.  There is no direct data, so nobody will talk about it. Analysts have used a 1BBl secret Chinese SPR that nobody knows where it is. To explain the work of #UpInSmoke #OOTT
2820 2018-03-22 18:16:14 When it  in LA, there are 2 types of drivers:

1) Freaked out locals who ride the break.

2) Frustrated transplants who get extra aggressive.

Oh, and the roads are slick w/oil.
2821 2018-03-22 18:16:11 My oil change cost me $200..this oil better be from the Gods
2822 2018-03-22 18:16:08 Dug out my oil burner and now my room smells like a rose garden~ <3
2823 2018-03-22 18:15:52 US and oil memes on this fb group are getting better and betterererer
2824 2018-03-22 18:15:52 Dana, I was Paleo, then Keto. Dropped 90% veg 2017. Now: only chocolate, some olive oil, onions, garlic, mushrooms. tea, coffee. Did those who eliminated joint pain switch to meat/water only and/or GIVE UP DAIRY? Curious if those success stories kept tiny amts plants.
2825 2018-03-22 18:15:46 Whip together 1 pound buritto with 4 1/2 tbsps bluefish. Mix in Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve on salad
2826 2018-03-22 18:15:43 Despite being bad at his job & a sleazy oil guy, I think even Rex saw the corruption & ineptitude of Trump’s White House as a danger to our country & our democracy. 
Hopefully we’ll be hearing more about that from him. (Remember “fucking moron”... )
2827 2018-03-22 18:15:35 I see it like corp oil and gov shitting on your deck just outside your back door.  Every time you walk out that door you see and smell it but you cannot do anything about it because Brett Wilson, corp oil, gov wants it there. Leave the old lady alone.  She’s tired of your crap!
2828 2018-03-22 18:15:34 I've had KP all my life and literally nothing has worked. On a whim I purchased the coconut oil scrub from VS...it took 3 days and it's gone....3!! #coconutoilscrub
2829 2018-03-22 18:15:23 "I'm having a leggings, cook wear, nail strips, amway, diet stuff essential oil, and vitamin party! It'll be the best! Plz bring like, idk, $5k! Brand new you! Sign up and sell, too" Every. Single. Day.
2830 2018-03-22 18:15:21 They're like Aus. A large part of their economy is in the extraction of oil and gas. Political conflicts abound.

2834 2018-03-22 18:14:52 'The oil sheen on this particular tarmac is especially prismatic.'
2835 2018-03-22 18:14:50 Why does the USA as the largest producer of cheap shale oil need to steal anyone else’s?
2836 2018-03-22 18:14:45 Funding wouldn’t be a problem if you could transport oil to markets, but that’s not how Socialists roll is it.
2837 2018-03-22 18:14:44 Is TORC part of this 'unified' series or is the 'unified' part that LOR is back in the Midwest?
2838 2018-03-22 18:14:41 data is the new snake oil?
2839 2018-03-22 18:14:39 Idris, please go and dig for oil in the Sahel desert, when you and your folks starts speaking Hausa/Fulani down South in government agencies, then there's something very wrong in the shit-hole called Nigeria.
Next kidnapping would be in God knows where in the North, Kano
2840 2018-03-22 18:14:20 Why EVERY TIME you go to get a oil change they come w/ two or three other things to get changed . Bruh i ain’t come here to spend 50 extra dollars 
2841 2018-03-22 18:14:14 essential oil, the modern day snake oil
2842 2018-03-22 18:14:09 my little baby at the dealership getting a oil change miss her already
2843 2018-03-22 18:13:50 Missing Maun .Where the work started.  Where the oil was poured .Maun my home village
2844 2018-03-22 18:13:46 The blame game however needs to end.   TMX should happen and full credit to the NDP under Premier Notley.    There is however more pain in the oil and gas industry which is not understood.   Let’s reopen the EE Pipeline dabate and build gas pipelines to Tidewater.
2845 2018-03-22 18:13:38  My other hand was busy...lol...reaching for the coconut oil..!!
2846 2018-03-22 18:13:20 @VictoriasSecret your coconut oil scrub needs to be marketed for those with KP. I purchased it on a whim and in 3 days my KP is gone...3 days!! Had it all my life #keratosis
2847 2018-03-22 18:13:20 Coconut oil fam
2848 2018-03-22 18:13:18 Melatonin has the opposite affect on me. I use l-theanine and CBD oil. :)
2849 2018-03-22 18:13:16 Port getting oil spill funds!  Just how were they harmed by the spill.  Just more government corruption.
2850 2018-03-22 18:13:14 Things we don't get enough rain for people to think about it. Also dry roads accumulate oil and grim, which makes roads extra slippery and hazardous when it does start to rain, so for us it's like driving on snow in other places.

2855 2018-03-22 18:12:54 Enviable optimism if he thinks that by the time today's dead plants and animals become #oil we will still be kicking around!
2856 2018-03-22 18:12:44 Unlike the oil industry, which is known for its kindness and warmth.
2857 2018-03-22 18:12:14 Clove oil will kill the pain and if you use it long enough it can kill any infection. It’s real
2858 2018-03-22 18:12:09 Perhaps you wouldn't get any kind of disease if you had been a robot.
But then, the American vampires really will try to take your oil...
2859 2018-03-22 18:12:08 Data is the new Oil!
2860 2018-03-22 18:12:00 sort you out some Rick Simpson oil mate no probs.
2861 2018-03-22 18:12:00 No comparison of Sudan sanctioned in 1997 and S.Sudan sanctions, bcoz Sudan by then was well off in terms of industrialisation,trade, agriculture,&her foreign policy with Arab world,China,&Russia where better&this let them resisted US sanctions &expand oil explorations, can we?.
2862 2018-03-22 18:11:45 Where can i buy anoininting oil? Its serious now.
2863 2018-03-22 18:11:42 Hillary's Emails.

In 2014 Cambridge analytica briefs Luka oil on targeting American voters. 

Mike Flynn claims he's the general to new kind of cyber army. Fighting a new kind of war.

Trump in talks to build Trump tower Moscow. Signs letter of intent.
2864 2018-03-22 18:11:38 Try making an apricot lyrical abstraction work with sesame oil!
2865 2018-03-22 18:11:34 ChesseSteaks from the street carts are disgraceful I was basically drinking oil
2866 2018-03-22 18:11:34 Sir, we need your help. We need our transformer to be changed from which the oil has been leaking for over 1 1/2 months. Our complaint is not heard. It’s dangerous. I live in Sahibabad, rajinder nagar, sec-2.
2867 2018-03-22 18:11:33 I need a hot oil + deep condition treatment tonight
2868 2018-03-22 18:11:21 No, they already have the US by the throat. As of 26th of march they will permanently ditch the petrodollar and trade oil only in Chinese Yuan. Russia, Brasil and Iran will all do the same this monday. the USD is in for a wild ride. Who knows how many countries will follow
2869 2018-03-22 18:11:11 Not at all. Been along the Prom today and its clear. No palm oil. Not sure what the beach is like but Prom ok
2870 2018-03-22 18:11:08 >Current year
>Still believes blood for oil is a thing

USA is the 3rd largest producer of oil and is almost 100% energy independent. Our desert vassal is the 2nd and our little brother in the North has the largest oil reserves

The Middle East Wars are to help our greatest ally
2871 2018-03-22 18:10:51 i’ve had amazing luck with the farriers formula supplement & farriers fix hoof oil. also massaging corona into the cornet band helps keep the foot strong :)

2873 2018-03-22 18:10:29 yes these are 3 different statements from prior oil changes.  the 718 is the most recent one . I understand they want to have everything current on the vehicle but come on its getting out of hand imo
2874 2018-03-22 18:10:25 Whats going on buddy..Hafter Hafter...Hafter is a reality not an illusion..he is the ruller of half of libya...He controls East Libya, South East and may be all south and Oil Ports. All Officials in East are under his control.these are facts I am afraid.

2878 2018-03-22 18:10:04 Bottled water is more expensive than oil. I repeat, more expensive than oil. Stop buying disposable plastic bottles - BYOB or bust
2879 2018-03-22 18:09:53 Like oil, when it leaks it gets really messy. 

#CambridgeAnalytica
2880 2018-03-22 18:09:52 Oil can 3mins late for no apparent reason except to pollute the air even more.

2889 2018-03-22 18:07:43 Same! I think for me it was mostly the type of oil. It also helped when I applied it at night versus the AM
2890 2018-03-22 18:07:40 Screen fixed, oil chanded im in my bag today
2891 2018-03-22 18:07:38 You will forever be remembered as the man who tried to destroyed the state department of the United States of America. You were there only to make oil deals while you decimated the state department
2892 2018-03-22 18:07:37 Only $650 to get my truck out of the shop. Thank God for warranties. Ok’ girls coming back with a newer tranny with only 90k on it and no more oil leak.
2893 2018-03-22 18:07:09 Just watched Tiger Zinda Hai, all the nurses, guards and isis commander have done better acting, oil tankers have better expression than Katrina
2894 2018-03-22 18:06:59 I guess you don't have enough oil in your body.
2895 2018-03-22 18:06:56 @garcia_mailey Oof! Have you taken care of the oil change?
2896 2018-03-22 18:06:52 y a vos te parece que un tipo que compra medio no tenga para pagarle a los empleados sin contar la guita q se quedo de OIL, de impuestos que pagaste vos si cargabas en esa cadena?
2897 2018-03-22 18:06:52 I just bought a cool new Samsung Galaxy SG  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2898 2018-03-22 18:06:51 $10-$30 oil... Fucking homos... What you think I got first.

2901 2018-03-22 18:06:10 Ayyyy todo mi inicio hablando de fuel oil
2902 2018-03-22 18:06:10 I agree, but just reminding all not to admire a greedy oil magnet who has caused considerable harm in pursuit of wealth. Otherwise, we desensitize, accept lower standards for ethics, etc.
2903 2018-03-22 18:06:09 If I was poisoned in a foreign land levering as a ExPat I would expect my embassy and @foreignoffice to be able to visit me and see what treatment I am being received. As an educated man this all seems rather convenient

2905 2018-03-22 18:05:46 the hardest part is going to be weaning of Zoloft... I couldn't take it while I was sick with the flu since I wasn't eating and I felt like a psycho!! I know THC already does wonders for me but wanting to try CBD oil, too...
2906 2018-03-22 18:05:43 you put them into a wax melter or an oil burner with a small candle underneath and just pop in the melt. The frangrances from the essential oils are then released. When the scent goes just pop the wax (hard) in the bin. I used one for three days and still getting the aroma
2907 2018-03-22 18:05:37 تقصدينهم
2908 2018-03-22 18:05:35 Venezuala makes sense (queue CIA coup!) Iran also, but KSA too? I guess they'll be buying Russian arms soon if they decide to switch. 
Gaddafi was about to create pan-African Dinar, Saddam (reportly) was going to sell Iraqi oil in €.

You know the conclusion I'm drawing...
2909 2018-03-22 18:05:22 It should be fine! If you add the oil to your dye it helps too!! I also sometimes put a little in my conditioner too
2910 2018-03-22 18:05:17 Buying an oil fryer was the best worst choice I think I've ever made. I'm going to gain so much weight
2911 2018-03-22 18:05:16 You know what, MSM?

You have lied so huge and so blatantly during at least the past two decades that even if some of you say now was true, we don’t believe you anymore.

You already sold enough snake oil.

2922 2018-03-22 18:04:30 You love animals...so do I..why does someone lift the ban on trophy hunting...when these animals are on the brink os extinction...or the ban on drilling off our coasts (except Florida)...more oil spills...COME ON...I would be pissed at Obama too...
2923 2018-03-22 18:04:28 Irritants can enter your skin more easily, making it red and sensitive. Adding a skin oil to your routine will effectively repair your skin’s moisture barrier. It keeps the skin moist and healthy-looking, especially during the winter #skincare

2926 2018-03-22 18:04:18 Starting a vegan diet has really opened my eyes to so much.. it's a bit overwhelming. Plastic, animal cruelty, palm oil..  it's hard to know whether to rage or cry when thinking about it all
2927 2018-03-22 18:04:17 Oh, I so agree with you on that. They should have been coerced into finding Bin Laden, and if they didn't, screw their oil. But Bush didn't go there, which was corrupt and cowardly enough.
2928 2018-03-22 18:04:15 Actually makes me so mad the amount of redundancy there is in the oil industry right now, here’s me with two family members without a job with big families to look after!!

3024 2018-03-22 17:54:56 Well I can see it actually. Different states have different rules on what is a service versus a product. In my industry some businesses only pay sales tax on the oil and filter because the changing part of the oil change is a service.
3025 2018-03-22 17:54:48 The goal of rich global corporate elite is the same for all of them: To accumulate as much wealth as possible be any means available.  They have their specialty: oil men, gold men, tech men, weapons manufacturers, health care, realty, finance.  All the same desire to win. We lose
3026 2018-03-22 17:54:38 Their myopic shortsightedness views (on every fucking thing) only allows them to see immediate $$. Getting off of oil would take long term commitments and belief in the common good. 2 things the republicans, & some Dems, are really bad at. They are enriching themselves. Period
3027 2018-03-22 17:54:24 Hahahah he's getting an oil change for me, can't do him datttt dirty hehe
3028 2018-03-22 17:54:07 You right about the investor but the question is that he has a driving prototype if I m right,  but the fact that this will take away everything from the oil industry its not surprising that it might be scaring the hell out a lot of bug guns

3033 2018-03-22 17:53:33 Can you please explain to me why we should move forward with a potentially dangerous project when we have the technologies to be able to move away from oil dependence?
3034 2018-03-22 17:53:27 D present is a reflection of D past, we av to keep hammering  on Ddamage pdpthieves administration did to our nation . We can't just keep mute like they did gud wasting 100s of billion in $ proceeds of oil boom.

3041 2018-03-22 17:53:01 This statement is misleading. During PPP govt, In int market, oil prices were hovering around $100, the most expensive ever. The local fuel prices were reflective of that.
It is in PMLN’s time the prices came down to < $25/barrel. 
And these chimps didn’t reduce them as much.
3042 2018-03-22 17:52:58 You could show them how easily germs spread using glitter and oil?
3043 2018-03-22 17:52:55 A5: My favorite non-recipe: I love mixing cooked rice with random vegetables (such as zucchini, spinach) then adding some garlic powder and soy sauce. I top the rice with a fried egg and drizzle on some sesame oil. Yum! #NNMchat
3044 2018-03-22 17:52:41 I do a simple chicken/wild rice. Soften equal parts carrot, celery, onion, and some parsnip in olive oil with a little Garlic. Add some good quality chicken stock and boil. Turn to medium-low and add 1/2 cup wild rice, fresh thyme, & some chicken thighs. Cook until rice is done.
3045 2018-03-22 17:52:41 This one still kills me! Remember when kam rubbed baby oil on me and we went out playing that game for like 5 hours and I had blisters he to China! Or when you guys were at my house and we were going to your house and kam was standing on the four wheeler and you punched it
3046 2018-03-22 17:52:31 Last week was just an oil change and replace the leaky water pump, not an actual tune-up. I probably do need to just get a full tune-up soon.
3047 2018-03-22 17:52:27 Just dinna mix the oil and water

3049 2018-03-22 17:52:10 Incorporating those two, if US crude oil inventory levels are at or near all-time lows, then why are prices still below 70?
3050 2018-03-22 17:51:55 You only support Chelsea cos oil please leave this conversation.
3051 2018-03-22 17:51:31 I don’t want to get into a whole philosophical debate here but 1) US is largest oil and gas producer in the world 2) OPEC is controlled by the Saudis who have the cheapest/best/most oil 3) the US political system not in imminent danger due to debt eg Greece is still around.
3052 2018-03-22 17:51:31 I'm cooking dinner and I just got burned by hot oil
3053 2018-03-22 17:51:28 I did the same  I found some growth serum and it works! and castor oil is meant to help
3054 2018-03-22 17:51:10 They follow the money. With or without the Saudis, the Koch Brothers have the oil money. As long as oil makes them money, the Republicans will go with who has the money. (Some Democrats too)
3055 2018-03-22 17:51:03 You want coal companies to dump their waste into streams again? You want to open up our shoreline to oil drilling? You want Bears Ears monument sold off to extraction industries? You wanted to add a trillion dollars to the national debt? You want to import dead elephant bodies?
3056 2018-03-22 17:51:00 If I was 30. I would be paying my moms oil change. Not her paying mine wtf
3057 2018-03-22 17:50:58 oil dw im at ur side with the same sorta cold
3058 2018-03-22 17:50:56 Plus, it's possible, with low unemployment and large deficits, plus increasing costs for various goods due to the ill-conceived trade war, that we could get #stagflation—simultaneous slow growth/recession *and* inflation.

This happened during the oil shocks of the 1970s.
3059 2018-03-22 17:50:51 This is horrifying:

"Because of the way that BLM conducts oil and gas auctions — online, with minimal reporting requirements, and few restrictions of who can bid —  it’s almost impossible to find information about the companies that are buying public lands"

3061 2018-03-22 17:50:44 babibdi bubidi brewer's yeast in 250g of water, babidi bubidi mix with 500g of flowr, mix salt and oil, rest is EZ mixing, bubidi babidi
3062 2018-03-22 17:50:43 How we know it is a bad bill. RT @ChadPergram: Schumer says lawmakers “burned the midnight oil & ended up with bill that’s very good for American people.” Says “people in NY are happy with money secured for the Gateway project”
3063 2018-03-22 17:50:37 An oil change is a must tomorrow
3064 2018-03-22 17:50:26 Jamaican black castor oil with coconut for my head top.
3065 2018-03-22 17:50:24 Going to drink wine and make lamb pizza with roasted peppers and truffle oil with expensive cheese for dinner TONIGHT

3067 2018-03-22 17:50:13 Would happily buy a sesame oil candle if Yankee should ever make one 
3068 2018-03-22 17:49:52 No need to impose restrictions when China shifts buying the equivalent of $0.5bn/ day for oil import to CNY... start Mar 26... coincidence??
3069 2018-03-22 17:49:50 like oil was nationalized for Venezuela?
3070 2018-03-22 17:49:45 I’ve seen like 3 people come in who are for sure over the age of 18. And mommy paid for the oil change on THEIR car.
3071 2018-03-22 17:49:45 I think sentiment is changing as the price of oil goes up. Offshore service was decimated during previous cycle. Smart money is beginning to sniff out a recovery. Some of these companies like TDW have some long dates warrants that look interesting.

3076 2018-03-22 17:49:25 Its a minor risk compared to all the single hull unescorted ships coming and going from Canadas ports. 

And the oil revenue helps pay for a significant chunk of our social programs.
3077 2018-03-22 17:49:06 Make my family members own oil blocks
3078 2018-03-22 17:48:56 Yeah but what say you of the Americans and Oil memes?
3079 2018-03-22 17:48:54 One man decided to go into business. He succeeded so much that he decided to give back to his community. He couldn't afford to fix the whole community so he started with what he could do. One week after he started he lost his job (he worked in an oil company).
3080 2018-03-22 17:48:40 “Jeremy’s Soviet hat” finally marked the moment UK political discourse went full indyref. It was the “BBC weather map”/ “secret oil fields in the Clyde” moment of stupid.
3081 2018-03-22 17:48:37 The ziploc is required by the PO - my fragrance oil suppliers always put electrical tape around  the edges for insurance.
3082 2018-03-22 17:48:30 Well, I’m all stocked up with oil and wood this time, bring it on!!
3083 2018-03-22 17:48:29 Maybe Damon should start burning the midnight oil. He jacks off often enough.
3084 2018-03-22 17:48:24 Love that #RexTillerson has jokes on the way out. Hope there's no Crimea oil transport contracts in his back pocket or office supplies....
3085 2018-03-22 17:48:01 The war on Syria is driven by two factors, money & religion, money for oil pipes from the Gulf to EU and religion because a weaker Syria means a stronger Israel. As a Syrian who holds the Syrian nationality, this is how I see it, but feel free to see it as you see fit.
3086 2018-03-22 17:47:39 Political systems fall apart all the time. We're good until OPEC decides the USD isn't good enough, or until global demand for oil falls thru the floor. The IMF has no tools if the USD is rejected.

3090 2018-03-22 17:46:59 Why do i have so many sweatshirts with oil stains. What have I been doing
3091 2018-03-22 17:46:56 must be my kitchen cabinet ignorance. I swear I saw cooking oil  and cleaning products but for sure they store bananas in the fridge.
3092 2018-03-22 17:46:53 You're suggesting with that theory that the people on the Pro Oil side, like yourself and @BlairKing_ca , @BrockWarkentin are being paid to lobby for oil...as am I from these foreign sources to lobby against? This sounds like more of the script of what pro oil wants us to believe
3093 2018-03-22 17:46:45 When I was 3, I dumped an entire bottle of Wesson oil on the kitchen floor, then waited for my mother to walk in.  Apparently she took one step, went fanny over teapot, and I took off running.
3094 2018-03-22 17:46:44 Did your dermatologist say it was a bad reaction to weed? Im just trying to figure out how you assumed hemp oil is weed.

3096 2018-03-22 17:46:36 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
3097 2018-03-22 17:46:15 Actually western dancing with the Saudis every president seems to be dancing with Exxon. Because if we got off oil we wouldn't need to be dancing with the stars. And we can get off oil.
3098 2018-03-22 17:46:12 #superchickenrecipes Marinate thighs in yoghurt, jalapeño brine, salt and pepper overnight. Dredge in cornflour, shake the excess off. Make a pakoda batter with a bit of flour, breadcrumbs, salt, spices, chilli sauce & ice cold water. Dip the chicken in it and drop into hot oil.
3099 2018-03-22 17:46:05 You know you’ve been desperate to recover your voice when you’re sipping a mix of hot water, lemon, ginger and oil of oregano with no sweetener and you’re no longer disgusted because you’ve drank this so many times.

3109 2018-03-22 17:45:31 And whose fault is that.  #Bloodoil from ME should be banned, and made in Canada oil should be the priority. ME state religion should not be allowed to build mosques in Canada or donate to #TrudeauFoundation.  Each mosque is a flag of imperialism and conquest. #cdnpoli
3110 2018-03-22 17:45:26 So I’m tryna stop smoking right. So i bought a vape with the CBD oil.....
3111 2018-03-22 17:45:23 Hopefully we’ll soon see Pyrolysis ships harvesting this waste and recycling it back to oil for eventual processing back to new ABS. Pyrolysis is a process which isn’t polluting as the waste is ‘cooked’ without air. Small residue is high temp processed without air

3113 2018-03-22 17:45:04 Very into the way every vitamin I buy self-expunges the fish oil so that whenever I open the jar, the room fills with the smell of one of Heathcliff’s beloved trash can lid meals.
3114 2018-03-22 17:44:40 the noodles won't stick if you drain and eat right away. all you need is salt. but add oil if you like your sauce slipping around and not adhering to your pasta like a HEATHEN
3115 2018-03-22 17:44:33 Wars are fought over control of oil - Something we can replace with synthetic lubricants and alternative energy. Something you cannot eat.

Think what will happen as we continue to poison our ground water and build cities in water hostile regions. #WorldWaterDay

3127 2018-03-22 17:43:22 Your son will definitely care in 20 years when the oil dries up and we need to find alternate means for fuel! Lol! Your one step ahead man ... you should feel proud! Lol!
3128 2018-03-22 17:43:19 Well that is the only reason USA fights, just to steal some oil
3129 2018-03-22 17:43:18 Anything tea tree oil saves my life.... 10/10 recommend
3130 2018-03-22 17:43:04 Good question. Back to some televangelist I guess. Same con and snake oil.
3131 2018-03-22 17:42:52 It’s go have your hair growing like crazyy you go see results soon you take your next hair style down it might sound crazy but that shit really work and keep using the oil with it
3132 2018-03-22 17:42:52 my neighbors seem to be frying something of the sort and the smell of oil is making me nauseous af

3136 2018-03-22 17:42:26 Ensuring commodities such as #palmoil are grown in a sustainable way play a big role in helping to protect #forests. We're proud to be working with members like to M&S to transform the industry and make sustainable palm oil the norm.
3137 2018-03-22 17:42:23 Actually they have a rule that they need gender parity on boards of big companies, including oil and mining sector.
3138 2018-03-22 17:41:50 How do you remove oil paint from carpet ??
3139 2018-03-22 17:41:42 Rex will be teaching a four year organic chemistry course teaching how this relates to "electron transfer" pushing diagrams he learned on the oil derricks in the south Houston ocens.
3140 2018-03-22 17:41:39 He has not made it worse prior to 2015 (his hiring). Oil will miss but will finish ~.500. A lot better than 24-44-14 in 14-15.
3141 2018-03-22 17:41:26 One act of kindness a day doesn't make up for macro acts of the systemic indifference and corruption of an oil conglomerate that manipulates public opinion and gets activists murdered.
3142 2018-03-22 17:41:10 Yasss! Have you tried oil pastals?
3143 2018-03-22 17:41:06 Integrity my ass. Let's remember: The whole reason Rexxy was at SoS in the first place was to oversee oil deals with Russia. A functioning Dept and Congress-approved sanctions are antithetical to his mission.
3144 2018-03-22 17:40:53 Are we there for oil or planning another war and feel that it is a strategic location for US troops. Hmmmm
3145 2018-03-22 17:40:51 A very good reason!  The USA gets a super low price on Canada's exportable oil with the current pipeline system.  

Don't wise up, it will make Canada money and cost US money!

3149 2018-03-22 17:40:24 I just need someone to oil my scalp about 3 times a day 
3150 2018-03-22 17:40:24 Oh Dave, you can't have oil in panties, it would drip down your legs and be a fire hazard.
3151 2018-03-22 17:40:23 “Oh!!!! I get it now...”(Recalling the tummy aches his daughter have had in the past. He hands her lavender oil and burnt toast.)”This will do it. Rub some oil on your cheeks for the nausea and the burnt bread will settle your stomach.”
3152 2018-03-22 17:40:20 Don't feel bad for Rex Tillerson. He is a multimillionaire who, as a high-level executive of ExxonMobil, has lobbied to wreck our planet for profit and has fostered disturbingly close ties to despots to secure oil fields. Feel bad for everyone screwed over by guys like him.
3153 2018-03-22 17:40:19 Bakit kami walang efficascent oil sa bahay. 
3154 2018-03-22 17:40:09 Such a waste of oil.
3155 2018-03-22 17:39:47 The problem with #MalignantNarcissist @realDonaldTrump being a "great salesman" is he's selling snake oil, and poisons every well he passes. #TrumpIsUnfit #ConservativesWithoutAConscience #ThePitchforksAreComingForYou

3157 2018-03-22 17:39:45 Put some coconut oil on your broken heart you’ll be fine
3158 2018-03-22 17:39:43 A6: Try fresh basil, cilantro or parsley, or vinegars like balsamic, to make a dish pop! Herbs bring fresh flavor and vinegar boosts flavor intensity and tones down bitterness. Simple salt-free salad dressing? 2T extra virgin olive oil and 2T balsamic vinegar! #WINutritionChat
3159 2018-03-22 17:39:28 Which is one of the reasons Obama pushed for energy independence both in our oil production and expansion of wind and solar.
3160 2018-03-22 17:39:25 This is about oil tankers and oil spills in in our waters, where we have serious concerns about salmon populations and the plight of the whales that depend on salmon and clean waters. It's not about anywhere else...it's not about anything else as much as Pro Oil wants it to be.
3161 2018-03-22 17:39:15 Mickey Mouse is to a Young Living Representative as Toodles is to Essential Oil. #cantwealljustbefriends
3162 2018-03-22 17:39:00 I need to get a grip but I've been playing in oil
3163 2018-03-22 17:38:47 I read that there was an attempt to convert a Big Boy to fuel oil for a movie. It was concluded at that time that the firebox was too big (long) to sustain a fuel oil fire.

Is this a different plan or did I get the info wrong?
3164 2018-03-22 17:38:34 そげぶ

3166 2018-03-22 17:38:24 His policies suck...Oil drilling off our coasts (except Florida)..opening up our National parks for drilling and mining..strip ban on killing big game...introducing a taxscam to pad his bank account...making our deficit skyrocket in 1 year...etc.
3167 2018-03-22 17:38:08 Holy shit a meme too. I better give it some love, you drilled a long way for very little oil
3168 2018-03-22 17:38:07 Trumpsters are puppets of the oil mafia. Dashboard hypnosis, gasoline psychosis. Auto air pollution, day after day, stupid. Asphalt wastelands: stupid. STUPID! #CarFree is a far better lifestyle and urban design. #Divest from #polluter mafia. #ActOnClimate
3169 2018-03-22 17:38:06 15 months using 3rd party oil, another drop sub 30 cents, some things never change.

3180 2018-03-22 17:36:26 “Your most valuable asset — oil.”

Don't put coconut oil in our hair all the time
Don't Eat curry all the time 
Don't Sound like Apu from simpsons
Please don't take hints about our country from slumdog millionaire and such films. India is an extremely diverse and unique country+
3182 2018-03-22 17:36:10 Data is the new Oil
3183 2018-03-22 17:36:05 Then you’re burping castor oil and orange the whole day! Please let’s drop this now! 
3184 2018-03-22 17:36:02 You flushed your integrity down the toilet the minute you closed the State Department office that enforces sanctions and turned down the already appropriated money.  

Go back to your oil rigs and piles of cash Rex.
3185 2018-03-22 17:35:53 Just like oil. It still has a high value when it's burried underground.Extracting  it and making products out of it is what makes this money.

3189 2018-03-22 17:35:11 But you wouldn't be stopping the oil. If you stop the pipeline than it means more oil moving by train or trucks. I think that's more dangerous, which is why I support the pipeline.
3190 2018-03-22 17:35:08 I Don't Have Any Issue With Your Masturbation O! 

But Why Doing It With Anointing Oil? What Is Your Aim In Life?
3191 2018-03-22 17:35:05 I don't let my salads get boring
I already have cooked chicken I prepped earlier in the week.
Slice up some Romaine
Heat olive oil in small pan
Add mushrooms and sweet peppers
Add some bacon bits
Add in the pre-cooked chicken to sear
Combine
Season with salt and pepper
Cheese
3192 2018-03-22 17:35:04 Erin – bummer! That sounds like it would have been a great deal, but unfortunately our Baked chips have been discontinued. Same deal for Almond Oil line? 
3193 2018-03-22 17:35:02 still at @cnbc on the pumping creating trade war bs, had to TURN THEM OFF, yep, they going to retaliate, whatever, we have the hammer, and something they need a lot of, its called oil & nat gas, 40% of oil & gas exported goes where? 
3194 2018-03-22 17:35:00 i didn't know coconut oil
3195 2018-03-22 17:34:52 You are insinuating, through your own conspiracy theory that the people opposing the pipeline are driven by Tides and Leadnow when in fact we are driven by the fact we live here. The anonymous people or #bots behind the Pro Oil movement is the real conspiracy. #cdnpoli

3198 2018-03-22 17:34:36 @GeorgeMonbiot Pinker is a quack, peddling snake oil; a false prophet, saying 'Peace, peace!', when there is no peace. He condemns those of us who tell the truth as 'Jeremiahs'. But the thing about Jeremiah was that he was RIGHT.

3202 2018-03-22 17:34:12 Well, the forecast for next week is looking encouraging. I got lots of work to do out in the garage, too cold right now. Electraglide is ready to go though after an oil change a fresh tank of gas. 
3203 2018-03-22 17:33:53 I support the pipeline because I consider what the protestors are too busy yelling to think about: The oil will flow no matter what - stopping Trans Mountain only means transport by the more dangerous methods of road and rail. They only make oil transportation more unsafe.
3204 2018-03-22 17:33:18 Oil changes give you a great opportunity to offer “chillful worship”.

3207 2018-03-22 17:33:07 Rinsing and washing with separate sponges? Maybe time to replace both, they could be impregnated with oil and grease themselves, so they won’t clear it off of dishes.

3217 2018-03-22 17:31:49 Tjo abuti! Please don’t stir up childhood traumas! My grandma used to heat up the pulp of an orange and mix it with the castor oil. It was supposed to make it taste better. It always made it worse!

3219 2018-03-22 17:31:39 Sometimes oily skin can actually be the result of being too dry because it’s your body overcompensating, that’s why moisturizing reduces oil!

3221 2018-03-22 17:31:25 DRC problems are more human and externally funded. Their resources have not been much if a blessing. Attracting sharks that have no intention of yielding. Same will be with our minerals and oil.
3222 2018-03-22 17:31:21 I HATE THE PLACEMENT OF OIL FILTERS SOMETIMES. Why place a filter right next to piping that gets up to 200-300 degrees, like do you think I enjoy burning the fuck out of my hand ???

3230 2018-03-22 17:30:00 What sets Mederma® Quick Dry Oil apart? It's made w/ botanical ingredients that absorb into the skin, not sit on top of it. In fact, consumers prefer Mederma® Quick Dry Oil over Bio-Oil because it absorbs faster and more completely than Bio-Oil®.
3231 2018-03-22 17:29:52 He has also become rich because someone in the West believed new Russia needed to be supported with flow of money from the West, so they were buying gas and oil to make Russia rich and successful. It just didn’t work.

3237 2018-03-22 17:29:01 Ukraine, recall that in 2014, shortly after the US State Department facilitated the presidential coup in Ukraine, Joe Biden's son Hunter joined the board of directors of Burisma, Ukraine's largest oil and gas company. Surely that was merely a coincidence

3243 2018-03-22 17:28:28 Yeah, it's complicated and I have questions @RRapier. 1) Why export at all given the mbpd the US uses? 2) Given the recent lack of upstream investments, is exporting a good strategy long term for a country so utterly dependent on oil?
3244 2018-03-22 17:28:26 I chopped my finger up but good this morning trying to cut a mango and I'm sad about it. I smeared coconut oil on it bc it was on hand so we'll see how that goes

3304 2018-03-22 17:21:30 I think warm areas need more oil in their asphalt because it needs to expand and contract more. So, in the cold with rain and snow it is more slick. At least that's what I heard.

3310 2018-03-22 17:20:45 I know that. I make of it that you are poring oil on a flame. We are in a race-obsessed environment and the net of it is more division+ bitterness. It is not a neutral image. Context holds its undeniable sway. Wow.

3316 2018-03-22 17:19:49 Look at where fracking, oil extraction, toxic waste, communities most impacted by pollution are. Rich people and upper middle class people have too much influence and power under capitalism to allow those sorts of programs in their communities, and can afford to live elsewhere
3317 2018-03-22 17:19:44 I hope that all these back" channels" would not come back to bite us in the butt.

3338 2018-03-22 17:16:44 So far just tea tree oil, avocado oil and castor oil. I been wanting to get into more but i haven’t bought any yet cause those last long. Any you’d recommend?
3339 2018-03-22 17:16:31 Oil
3340 2018-03-22 17:16:14 .@Judgenap yesterday you talked about a judge who made ridiculous requests for 8 hours of worthless info to cost the oil industry and taxpayers huge & needless amounts of money yet you wouldn’t release this Obama appointees name? 
Why? Do it! The people need 2 know
3341 2018-03-22 17:16:11 @KarinaA75664861 That's awesome! Well, if you ever need a car wash or oil change, we're here for you!
3342 2018-03-22 17:16:00 lol sometimes. i do love working on my jeep. i need to change the oil, but that's not happening today.
3343 2018-03-22 17:15:47 Stormy has probably used plenty oil based products. 
3344 2018-03-22 17:15:37 This excuse will be the new thing. When we invade Iran, steal their oil & other resources, killing 100,000s or perhaps perhaps millions of people, some talking head will be on the MSM to reassure the American sheeple that this aggression is "in line with our foreign policy."
3345 2018-03-22 17:15:27 Hahaha me checking my own oil makes me feel real independent AF yooo
3346 2018-03-22 17:15:11 Apple cider vinegar, garlic, coconut oil, lavender oil, ginger, local honey, & cinnamon things you gotta keep on deck
3347 2018-03-22 17:14:53 Need to spray an aloe Vera juice and castor oil mix on my braids when I get home. My scalp itches.
3348 2018-03-22 17:14:43 tryna make my feathers look nice, hanging out with the Greeks and slamming Olive Oil
3349 2018-03-22 17:14:37 I need an oil change. It's usually like 60. The extra stuff they're suggesting brings it to almost 200.  Nahh fam.
3350 2018-03-22 17:14:28 Wonder if the MLP bloodbath this year will have any lasting effect on US oil production. One less source of easy financing from Wall Street. Less demand from investors as rates creep upwards.
3351 2018-03-22 17:14:26 c, let me enlight us a little. years back we had opportunity that we were selling our crude oil about 110 to 150 USD pb, yet we did nothing. The little dev we had, was just abt 10% out of 100% revenue generated vanished.
3352 2018-03-22 17:14:21 New tires oil change and car wash 
3353 2018-03-22 17:14:16 My avi look like a nigga named Cliff. Cliff always trying to replace ya transmission when you come in for a routine oil change. 

You really do need a new transmission tho.
3354 2018-03-22 17:13:54 Made with soybean oil
3355 2018-03-22 17:13:47 Do you call sandwiches with oil and vinegar “soup”, too?? Wtf
3356 2018-03-22 17:13:45 I guess that goes to show the futility of the oil industry if one proposed pipeline project can supposedly affect an entire economy. Give me a break

3368 2018-03-22 17:12:31 They will. $1deducted from every barrel of oil we import would do it. $1 added to every Money Gram sent to Mexico will do it. A $1 toll per car entering US from Mexico will do it. See my point?

If only he was 5 years younger he would own everyone and we would have challenged Pep till he gag'd on his bald head oil. Zlatan if you off. Thank You.
3373 2018-03-22 17:12:00 best thing I've tried is coconut oil no joke. get a spoonful and swish it around your mouth once a day for 10-20 min! I did it whilst doing my makeup :)
3374 2018-03-22 17:11:55 Yes I know but I probably wouldn’t stay home if I could lIke when daddy was in the oil field. I just didn’t cook
3375 2018-03-22 17:11:47 Combine 1 cup distilled water, 1 cup distilled white vinegar and 15 drops basil essential oil in a spray bottle to create an all-purpose cleaner.

3377 2018-03-22 17:11:42 I went to get my oil changed and the mechanic had the audacity to ask me if i wanted to change all the fluids in my car for a total cost of $250.99. Like I know he sees my McNeese sticker and License Plate holder. I know he isn’t assuming that a college student has money....
3378 2018-03-22 17:11:23 The point his making is that during ppp tenure the oil price was $100; during pmln time, it was historically low, yet still huge debt acquired by this government.

3389 2018-03-22 17:10:09 Dear lord, these "Bernie would have won" snake oil sellers need to take a hard look at the Cro-MAGAs and recognize the dangers of spouting delusional BS.

3406 2018-03-22 17:08:32 There has never been a more treasonous   party in Canada than the Green Party. The USA imports our oil and sells it at a profit the Green party is online with this practice why don’t they just go south!

3418 2018-03-22 17:07:26 I had some oil and Greenland gold shares once. They crept up a bit, peaked at around 130% what I'd paid. Waited. Lost the bloody lot as value nosedived. What do they say? Don't invest more than you can stand to lose... Grrrr.
3419 2018-03-22 17:07:26 Wait till the impact of this latest devaluation hits the industry as the price of electricity and gas goes up with oil prices. Whole world subsidizes its industry - we kill them with high input and capital costs.

3452 2018-03-22 17:03:07 But during WWII, Germany could only produce combustible gas from Coal. Which is very expensive to do. Furthermore, Germany had no easy access to fuel oil. What stocks it did have, it had to prioritize to its Army, Navy, Air Force. 

Therefore the Fables don't match the science.

3474 2018-03-22 17:00:59 And that new meaning is this: Just like killing machines of WW2 ran on oil, killing machines of WW3 run on data - data for weatherwarfare (sensors), data for economic warfare (GSTN, Aadhaar, fintech), data for cyberwar, data to crash power grids, etc etc #DataIsTheNewOil

3482 2018-03-22 17:00:10 America is just playing the spoiler by denying Syria access to its own oil so they can rebuild the country.  We know Trump wants to “keep the oil”.  Also, they have left a pocket of Isis in eastern Syria to legitimize their continued presence.

what next generations of saudi do in the future, the oil money is going abdroad. and no other inncome.
3490 2018-03-22 16:59:52 Why does Trump always have to State that America was inferior in some area before he got in office but he is going to fix it? Trump is a snake oil salesmen.  Imagine if Obama disrespected America everytime he wanted to implement some policy.  Republicans would freak out.

3494 2018-03-22 16:59:21 Well, As per some dingbat data means Vegetable which we eat perhaps he is thinking about that.

Data is a new Oil as per IT Minister so I can expect the level of non sense from them.

3496 2018-03-22 16:59:13 Yes! Why aren't all the oil naysayers coming up with these ideas instead of making a general nuisance of themselves!
3497 2018-03-22 16:59:05 I wish I knew. It's like there was no oil used whatsoever

3502 2018-03-22 16:58:24 We did make the decision to renew again. Had season tix since 79- last year we slit seats 3 ways-made it a little easier. I love the Oil but ever since they got the wait list I don’t think they love us as much #toughdecision

3527 2018-03-22 16:55:07 I will agree to pretty much anything offered that I can afford while getting the oil changed. I know nothing about cars and I am certainly ripped off at times, but I’m not about to figure that out anytime soon.

3529 2018-03-22 16:54:43 tire rotation, brakes, and oil change. im scurred to see the total.
3530 2018-03-22 16:54:41 Yes, the numerical target was a dumb idea.  I’m actually surprised the Chinese didn’t go this route. At an extreme they could buy loads of US oil and store it, while changing none of their policies (which will in fact never be changed absent a deep crisis).

3541 2018-03-22 16:53:21 You fail to mention, at that time everyone was expecting the typical oil price rebound. Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened.
3542 2018-03-22 16:53:20 Well your logic makes no sense. To.protest the oil company that follows the regulations is not their problem. Are you willing to admit you're against oil and want to see it phased out?
3543 2018-03-22 16:53:19 @kaseykahne just got my oil changed at Take 5, I had no idea you don’t even have to get out of your car! It was my own little NASCAR pit stop

Recently happened to me and I was LIVID! Company had no apologies, told me they were the same thing and I need to learn more about butter #diet #food
3572 2018-03-22 16:49:29 Yeah me too but the best solution is to just find better ways to transport oil rather than in water or better yet to stop extracting oil in oceans. Cleaning up a mess on soil is easier than ocean OR stop using fossil fuels but that wont happen soon...

3595 2018-03-22 16:46:59 Personally I think  the effectiveness might be lower than that. A lot of guys I know had never heard about how to roll the condom on the penis correctly or the difference between oil and water based lube but I guess the effectiveness is in proportional to sex-ed teaching.

3627 2018-03-22 16:43:37 Anything less than a 15 minute drive and you’ll just be draining the battery. Longer drives help lubricate all the moving parts with the oil once it’s heated up.

3655 2018-03-22 16:39:15 It's a horrifying way to think about a suffering people... but I can't help but think that Venezuela is now acting like Canada's tar sands. A more difficult way of attaining petroleum in reserve as a cap on oil prices.

3671 2018-03-22 16:36:55 “Where are the marches for BOMB CONTROL, huh?”

We HAVE bomb control already. Building or transporting a bomb gets you arrested. Hell, buying perfectly-legal fertilizer and fuel oil simultaneously gets you a visit from the FBI.

Just because there will be CNY traded oil futures where u can redeem ur balance in gold, it doesn't mean jack shit to cryptos... May just make the Yuan more powerful or devalue USD. That's it #cryptoscam.
3679 2018-03-22 16:36:05 I do think that electroacupunture is a different variation than conventional acupuncture and could definitely have different results - like the TENS machines.   people in pain are desperate to try anything for relief,just like overweight people will try any diet/snake oil.
3680 2018-03-22 16:36:04 Stop using oil, then. We can make carbon-neutral hydrocarbons from CO2 in water and air with a plethora of energy from nuclear power, forever, without drilling ever again.

3742 2018-03-22 16:30:04 I fail to see where the crypto tie-in is? Yes, China has been planning to settle oil futures in their own currency (Yuan) instead of USD beginning Mar 26. There's nothing crypto related here. Not sure what @landm_marius is referring to. 

This may impact the USD, but not cryptos.

Have successfully diversified their economy from oil to non oil sector. Afghanistan could tremendously  benefit of their experience. Great potential  partner,
3754 2018-03-22 16:28:47 I’m so annoyed. I ordered a grilled chicken wrap with bruschetta and it’s literally chopped tomatoes. No onion, basil, oil/vinegar. Plain ass chopped tomatoes. False advertisement for ya .. I’m so tempted to call & complain
3755 2018-03-22 16:28:39 The quality of our CBD oil supplements at Kannaway goes without saying considering our parent company Medical marijuana Inc publicly traded provides prescription CBD to Brazil & Mexico where it's still illegal. Holds licenses in Puert Rico & Paraguay the same. Its all about trust
3756 2018-03-22 16:28:38 Thanks for the correction, Mr. Brady, and for your reporting.  That makes a lot more sense.  I love NPR’s work (and rely on it almost daily), and I meant for the ire in that tweet to be directed toward the oil co. representative who said it rather than toward you or NPR.

3758 2018-03-22 16:28:34 Coconut oil is seriously my best friend in helping clear up my face
3759 2018-03-22 16:28:16 Dear lafafa and fake journalist, if u have researched u would have found that when crude oil was at 100$ in PPP time the petrol was at 80Rs and when 150$ in 2012 it was 107Rs. Now crude oil is at 60$ and petrol is above 80Rs.
3760 2018-03-22 16:27:51 In 2014 Victoria Nuland was caught on a phone tap discussing the US State Dept-sponsored overthrow of the Ukraine Govt. As a reward for Biden's role in legitimizing the $100 M regime change- Ukraine oil company Burisma appointed Biden's son Hunter to its Board of Directors.#qanon
3761 2018-03-22 16:27:45 I am in oil & gas too.  It sucks the life out of you.  I want to go back to the aviation industry but I cannot take too big of a pay cut.
3762 2018-03-22 16:27:26 how y’all females claim to be so clean but leave the bathroom smelling like motor oil and hot dog water is beyond me. 
3763 2018-03-22 16:27:26 You mean the ones that call offshore oil/gas drilling "sustainable" and give permission to drill and survey in protected waters? ... and we wonder why Right whales are being killed.
3764 2018-03-22 16:27:19 i just started using a micellar oil cleanser and my skin feels very soft thank you that's all

3771 2018-03-22 16:26:37 bio oil.... it’s my life
3772 2018-03-22 16:26:36 Trump thinks Plato is the enemy of Popeye, Socrates is the name of a Russian prostitute he met in a Ritz Carlton, and Shakespeare is something you do in the middle East when dancing for donations from Oil Rich regimes.
3773 2018-03-22 16:26:17 Higher oil = market convulsions ...

Who could have possibly guessed?
3774 2018-03-22 16:26:08 Sounds like a description of a snake oil salesman
3775 2018-03-22 16:26:03 Do you understand my people cannot purchase petro, and also petro will be priced by the government.  $petro is not $crypto, not a currency and not backed by oil.
3776 2018-03-22 16:26:03 seems like exxon could avoid all the negative pr associated with oil spills by not naming all the shipps "exxon ____"

3780 2018-03-22 16:25:46 Oil up $4 Monday thru yesterday, summer gas transition
3781 2018-03-22 16:25:28 I used to do my own oil changes, but the cost of the synthetic I use has become so expensive that it’s cheaper to have the dealer do it. Plus it keeps me on good record in case of warranty work later.
3782 2018-03-22 16:25:14 Oil or mayo imo, no dipping sauces like ranch or ketchup
3783 2018-03-22 16:25:00 Yeah, they were kindhearted folks, just lacking in observational powers. They should've noticed how the black Sudanese were treated as customers and that the books & newspapers for sale there were framing the civil war as a fabricated Bush/Clinton conspiracy for oil...
3784 2018-03-22 16:24:55 Regret putting lavender oil into the air purifier... now headache due to the lavender smell in my bedroom .. lol 
3785 2018-03-22 16:24:53 The #omnibus also provides @ENERGY's Office of Fossil Energy $727 million, a $59 million increase over 2017, which is responsible for advanced coal, natural gas and oil technologies. It also provides Office of Nuclear Energy $1.2 billion, $178 million increase over 2017
3786 2018-03-22 16:24:52 indeed @EvemargoH - what should he secretary of? the department of evasion? department of oil & gas? the possibilities are endless!
3787 2018-03-22 16:24:43 Oil spills are good for business????  That’s really twisted thinking. #stopkindermorgan

3789 2018-03-22 16:24:35 Oil change done. Ready for my trip to Florida this weekend.

3791 2018-03-22 16:24:00 Henny is what I would guess motor oil taste like.
3792 2018-03-22 16:23:46 one bad thing about driving all the time is that I feel like I’m constantly getting my oil changed 
3793 2018-03-22 16:23:38 If you are a shitty employer/manager/owner job seekers are going to avoid you place of business like the plague. I think they rather drink motor oil!
3794 2018-03-22 16:23:25 These numbers are just false. 200,000 unemployed Albertans? Only 150,000 are employed in the oil and gas sector lol. Goes to show that the cons have to resort to lying and bots to eat their point across 
3795 2018-03-22 16:23:24 Let me give you a scenario. We import oil into Nigeria. Marketers buy them, claim subsidies, and resell to neighboring countries at huge profit, while we queue for fuel here from scarcity. All because we signed the ECOWAS deal. Get it?
3796 2018-03-22 16:23:21 What a fantastic story.  This snake oil business is infuriating and just plain evil.
3797 2018-03-22 16:23:21 My anxiety has come such a long way in the past few years, it literally used to TERRIFY me to even go get my oil changed by myself, and here I am at the doctors office by myself making appointments. It doesn’t seem like a lot but I’m proud of myself and how I’m overcoming it
3798 2018-03-22 16:23:20 You change it less often though so you save money. Honda is 3 months/4000 miles. Word of advice is don't run it past 7500 miles/1 year on synthetic if the dealership is providing the oil. Honda synthetic oil is not that great and running it longer can (1/2)
3799 2018-03-22 16:23:13 What do you care if the workers' lives are endangered and the waters are polluted, so seafood is poisoned as is the air we breathe? Why can't you attract industries that won't kill us and ruin our quality of life? There's more than oil and tourism.
3800 2018-03-22 16:23:10 Dang, I'm sorry. You could always try finding some soap with tea tree oil in it to use a few times a week to see if that helps your acne! It can be a little expensive, but it worked for me.
3801 2018-03-22 16:23:03 Girl I’m seriously gonna go to scoop some lavender oil. I can never sleep. Ever. I’ll share my results!

3803 2018-03-22 16:22:53 They have a refinery near us down for a shutdown but this is a play by the oil companies for us to build a pipeline that is seeing massive opposition by our provincial government.  Plus we have highest gas tax in the world.

3809 2018-03-22 16:22:18 @BillNye you recently confronted our pm in Canada about an oil pipeline, can I ask if you used any oil on your trip to Canada and to get around?  If so how do you think that oil should have been moved?

3818 2018-03-22 16:21:03 my face produces so much oil that i could start my own oil company
3819 2018-03-22 16:20:55 its ALL about oil.
3820 2018-03-22 16:20:42 -Jesus turned water into wine (oil).
-He set OWT 5000 people with fish and bread.
-He wore a royal purple robe.
-He walked everywhere.
-He broke bread with all of his LBs even though one of them was cat (Judas). 

Sounds like da Bruhz to me 
3821 2018-03-22 16:20:38 Keep in mind it just seems disproportionate. You’re changing oil less frequently so you spend more in one change for better oil than paying less more frequently for lesser grade oil.
3822 2018-03-22 16:20:35 if lit inside the house this extra energy can get accumulated in the house and turn into negativity and trouble inmates if not energy cleansing done.. so the oil which represents shani maharaj and generates less energy compared to ghee lamp like mustard oil lamp should be lit 2/n

3826 2018-03-22 16:20:07 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for plumeria balm, and put some lemongrass essential oil in my diffuser.
3827 2018-03-22 16:19:53 I love how every Sens game has had ticket prices drop to a ridiculously low price EXCEPT when the Oilers come to town. God damn Oil fans are too good and loyal.

3834 2018-03-22 16:19:11 You should put caster oil on the parts that won’t grow and increase your healthy fats (olives, avocados, walnuts) it seriously makes such a difference!
3835 2018-03-22 16:19:10 @AztecDuncan, any good source to argue why Mexico shouldn't invest in oil refining?

My last vehicle was a 2007 Accord base model, with each oil change never going over a 35 dollar price tag. This model seems to just take synthetic with an 70 dollar price tag.
3850 2018-03-22 16:17:12 Don’t be naive. Venezuela was taken down by outside sources. Bush railed on about Chavez during his tenure. Major oil producing country.
3851 2018-03-22 16:17:07 Thank You @RockwallFordTX for my complimentary FIRST oil change today!!
3852 2018-03-22 16:17:04 Until we move off of fossil fuels, the Saudi's have us by the short and curlies.  If they flood the market with cheap oil it' hurts us bad.

3858 2018-03-22 16:15:49 100% of all soy beans are also pressed 4 soy bean oil. The soy bean oil industry preceded the soy meal industry by 30 years. Most of the soy meal goes to chickens. So we agree eat less chicken...but also eat less french cooked in soy bean oil. No one here advocates for CAFO's.

3869 2018-03-22 16:14:04 A few months ago Inread an article by Robert Fisk talking about Putin and Saudi determining the course of Mideast power broking. Sounded like they wanted to share control of the oil.

3873 2018-03-22 16:13:42 the joke is both the non-seq and also the literality: the oil change is a good suggestion. It is possible the author meant "advice"

3881 2018-03-22 16:13:24 I can't tell you the hours I have spent searching for such an animal.  What is being largely sold today is a blend of oils.  They are mostly generic with a low % of true olive oil.  Most of the bottles don't even list ingredients anymore.
3882 2018-03-22 16:13:20 what moms used to tell me..? you can't slick a can of oil..
3883 2018-03-22 16:13:15 I was just thinking about how much I love the oil rig scene today. Like when the skipper said, “Greenhorn? Greenhorn!” and there was no answer I just knew he was going to save them and was just beaming

3888 2018-03-22 16:12:44 Art - that was awesome.  Just finished the pres.  One possible addition...you note that a huge amount of oil was produced at a loss during 2015 and 2016...how much debt was taken on during that time?  That is, all of that debt has a rate of interest..so the losses are bigger?
3889 2018-03-22 16:12:43 Not sure about that, Jeffery. I looked into welfare. We spend more money on military and oil subsidies than poor-lazy folks. Welfare isn't bottomless. And, I know struggling, hard-workers with multiple jobs.

It might be our laws don't protect poor from lazy landlords.
3890 2018-03-22 16:12:42 Low oil prices, deferred infrastructure from previous govts and stimulus spending.
3891 2018-03-22 16:12:38 Wow. You can't tell me that they did this all by accident. They are to clever.They maybe push sometimes the border of science.

3896 2018-03-22 16:11:50 I love tea tree oil ! If your skin is sensitive I would suggest diluting a q tip with water and then dipping it in the oil and spot treating.
3897 2018-03-22 16:11:42 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
3898 2018-03-22 16:11:36 Not quite.
 If China does not get oil from Canada they will from elsewhere, Russia, Saudi Arabia, US.

 Oil provides tens of thousands of UNIFOR jobs.

Oil already travels down the coast from Alaska & through BC on rail every day.

Since the discovery of oil, we can see how the gov in the way they handle money, we cant "leap of faith" in and hope for the best. Let the gov show some incentives rather than barking orders. You hear the news everyday, if it was a business, will u put money in it?

3910 2018-03-22 16:10:55 I use them and aside from them being kinda pricey I really like them. You can also use vinegar and essential oil as softener but it's bad for the pipes.

3912 2018-03-22 16:10:48 They will never buy us because no money ever could our values lay in the earth, the sky, four legged and 2 legged things not oil, gas or yellow metal.
3913 2018-03-22 16:10:48 @HurdOnTheHill The 1st oil refinery built in the Great State of Texas in 41 years is being built in your district: congratulations... #MMEX $MMEX
3914 2018-03-22 16:10:47 Asked at the gas pump: "Is this a debit card?". This is a hard question to answer. What it's really being asked, " Do you want to give your money to robber baron banks or robber baron oil companies?"

3921 2018-03-22 16:10:06 Of course, almost the only Kings left, an idea from 1000 years ago. Kings do not make the world better. Oil against money. Boring Boris. Real Kings have Real Solutions, like Zero-Point-Energy. Hydro-Power, Fusion Power. It will come and the real noble will raise.

3924 2018-03-22 16:09:55 well, "reliable" yes is key, risks certainly, but oil & currency in relation to petro-$ too, knowing what we do, the obvious Q would by: why?-it could all have been so much different had India got *proper* support on that '80-'90's wave, bottom line=not worth risk,ie: uncertainty
3925 2018-03-22 16:09:44 Up here a heads up, with our noreaster thats still here. moister pounds are still heavy! I remove the water restictor and go to a 150 degree thermo. and wrap our oil sump tank in a foam wrap. But the engine settings are vital for us with a carb. I even swith to smaller headers.

3942 2018-03-22 16:07:34 We've got a great family owned gun store right over the state line. Of course, unlike the lying left, we know you can't cross state lines to buy a gun, so we go there to purchase, and have to have it shipped to a local store in our state for $30 charge.

what has England pooled and shared?
Do you agree that Westminster has near bankrupted an oil rich UK?,,,,
think about that hazel,,scots had more oil than Dubia and Abu Dhabi combined,
it wasn't spent in Scotland though was it
3947 2018-03-22 16:07:11 You would think that Target's non-recovered slump would have been enough of a warning.

3951 2018-03-22 16:06:57 Very possible if you consider low oil prices to be an artifact of low interest rate policy through yield seeking in the shale industry

3972 2018-03-22 16:04:16 Clearly, you are not very well informed.  Read what happens to a country if it prints currency notes without any pause.

4033 2018-03-22 15:58:58 so I just returned home and it smells like almond oil. I legit wanna throw up.
4034 2018-03-22 15:58:55 alam ko kasi dun din sa platform nila ginagawa diba ano during ng extraction nila ng oil parang hinihiwalay na rin nila yung gas tapos pipeline pipeline tas ayon boom boom pow 
4035 2018-03-22 15:58:54 RECIPE:
2 Eggs mixed with
Dill
Lemonjuice
a little cheese to taste, we used monterrey jack

Wash and boil fiddleheads about 10 min

put down fiddleheads and let them fry a bit in your oil of choice, pour egg mixture over and make that omelet
4036 2018-03-22 15:58:53 Soya milk as substitute sounds too easy! So how about "evaporated milk"? It gives the required thickness & richness, plus a mild hint of sweetness, sans the coconut flavor. Although, you can add a spoonful of coconut oil to get that flavor & smell.
4037 2018-03-22 15:58:51 Is that by paying multinational oil companies to rape our resources? How does@that benefit anyone but them and their shareholders?
4038 2018-03-22 15:58:37 I usually use organic veg oil spread. Peanut butter is more like occasional treat. Almond butter and coconut manna are nice too. Bread is boring so I need to use different spreads to bring some excitement to my life, lol.
4039 2018-03-22 15:58:36 The mineral oil will not last for ever.Saudi Arabia should industralize its nation so that dependence on petroleum is reduced.
4040 2018-03-22 15:58:24 If hate and anger were viable energy sources this country wouldn't need oil, coal, solar, wind or nuclear.  #ThursdayThoughts
4041 2018-03-22 15:58:18 I have my satin robe, face mask and lavender oil diffuser on. No one talk to me, thanks

4043 2018-03-22 15:58:16 I continued to apply vitamin e oil to my stomach and tanning helped even out the complexion. It did take a while for them to fade.
4044 2018-03-22 15:57:56 Okay I’ll try it. What’s the oil for?
4045 2018-03-22 15:57:49 モモくんひでぇwwwwwwwwwwwwww
4046 2018-03-22 15:57:41 Depends on the type of gas injection:

1) Lesser increases in lighter oil production from the same reservoir (miscible gas injection alters chemistry of crude oil)

2) Decrease in Gas Injection reduces oil recovery factor by enhancing reservoir pressure decline
4047 2018-03-22 15:57:38 My man @bigfutureE is celebrating at least his 40th birthday today. (I don't trust his Ghanian birth certificate). I wonder he's gonna do with his oil money to celebrate the big 4-0
4048 2018-03-22 15:57:37 Oh thank god my rose hip oil and exfoliation stuff came in i was dying
4049 2018-03-22 15:57:32 Oh bro, the indians have stumbled upon extra virgin olive oil. And that shits making the indians go crazy. .
4050 2018-03-22 15:57:12 Remember when Iraqi oil was going to pay for their, “liberation?”
4051 2018-03-22 15:57:03 Too uneven though...and the oil from the clippers always contributed to breakouts. Plus razor shaving lasts longer between sessions.
4052 2018-03-22 15:56:52 Interesting observation: The NDP's 2015 platform predicted a $25m SURPLUS for this year. What number will we see today in Budget 2018? FWIW, oil price drop started in summer 2014. NDP platform released April 2015, when oil avg. ~$58/barrel. Today, oil ~$65/barrel.
4053 2018-03-22 15:56:50 Oh thank God for good friends! Lol!! :)
4054 2018-03-22 15:56:36 I hope that the result of the drilling will be good insha'Allah, because if oil is discovered there it will encourage all major oil companies to drill everywhere in Somalia. But the Somaliland regional government needs to update the federal government.

4056 2018-03-22 15:56:34 I quit going there not necessarily because of the policy because they didn't really sell what they said they would stop selling but because they jumped on the propaganda bandwagon no courage not getting my business.
4057 2018-03-22 15:56:32 Exfoliating and jojoba oil.
4058 2018-03-22 15:56:28 Burnt myself nge oil. 
4059 2018-03-22 15:56:23 I get that but I think if you play it somewhere that has a decent number of teams in the region,you'd probably see a decent turn out. I'd be afraid to play it at Lucas Oil (too big) maybe Nippert?Louisville would be good-if not a baseball diamond. Maybe a destination?Vegas/NYC/TB

4061 2018-03-22 15:56:12 I personally don’t care. That’s great If people are doing well. I’m just not a fan of gun toting NRA fans. We’ve seen how well that has done for our neighbors. And many are not doing so well in the oil industry these days.
4062 2018-03-22 15:56:09 Fish oil, especially salmon oil, is very powerful anti-inflammatory.
4063 2018-03-22 15:56:02 Will the charging stations need as much oil as the cars that have been replaced needed?

4067 2018-03-22 15:55:51 No it’s not. Digging gold out of the ground is proof of work. Getting oil out of the ground is proof of work. Growing corn is proof of work. PoS is a failed evolution of PoW

I usually use it in winter to base my scalp and to strengthen my hairline.  It's only R35 @ clicks.

4084 2018-03-22 15:54:02 Hoping it's not to tell us how green and good fracking is going to be for the economy. Please not another push in the wrong direction.  Going Green is about Not Fracking and conserving our Clean Water. Gas/oil industry/mining are gross consumers and wasters.  Water is finite!!!
4085 2018-03-22 15:53:41 The total oil and gas revenues for UK Hazel

4094 2018-03-22 15:52:56 Their palm oil too
4095 2018-03-22 15:52:51 Actually it will. You know why? They need the oil to power the car chargers. Demand still stays.

4099 2018-03-22 15:52:38 Yeah, but two cars means double the insurance, double the oil changes, double the gas, etc. It's not easy, but it's so worth it. Selling Mat's car easily saved us at least $500 a month.
4100 2018-03-22 15:52:37 Ha Harold - thought everybody knew why 
Primarily sugar, refined carb and vegetable oil metabolic effects (i.e. processed food).
 Throw in a bit of environmental pressures from modern processed-food-pushing environment.
And a few other factors like exercise etc 
4101 2018-03-22 15:52:35 I was going to start raising Great Horned Owls to hunt them to extinction but the permitting/application process is just insane here. So we just got a guy to get rid of them.

We are part of the problem, alas.

4104 2018-03-22 15:52:22 You need to just answer the question Ted and stop trying to run away
What is more 8% or 100%,of oil water cake pick anything you want
is 8% of it more or less than 100% of it?
4105 2018-03-22 15:52:15 They are responsible for most of the misery in the Middle East,
For fuck sake they can host 10 million people in air conditioned accommodation outside of hajj. The fuckers left millions of muslim refugees fend for themselves.
fuck them. I hope the oil hole opens and swallows them
4106 2018-03-22 15:52:08 Agree!! I get so excited about an oil change now. Bonus comfy reading chairs. I volunteer to take all the family cars

4110 2018-03-22 15:51:52 Chewed through our van's wiring harness a few years back. I didn't even know that was a car part. $1,200 later, I know. And I hate squirrels.

Then we had the flying kind set up shop in our attic one year, apparently bowling with acorns. That was a fun few weeks of nightmares.
4111 2018-03-22 15:51:36 Here’s my advice:

Yes, eat that.
No, do not text that fuckboy back.
Coconut oil.
4112 2018-03-22 15:51:32 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪

お寝坊さん大丈夫だった？？笑 ちゃんと休んでね
4114 2018-03-22 15:51:16 Did you know the way it actually works is that Venezuela's government says it will value your $petros at whatever price it calculates oil is at when you use them to pay taxes? That sounds to me like #Regulations.
4115 2018-03-22 15:51:15 I applaud the bill (We need it here), but the problem is the cost. Opiods cost $15-$100 per month with ins or medicare, cannabis oil can cost $500 a month vs "smoking" & not covered. It's cost prohibitive for a lot, but I love the push/bill.
4116 2018-03-22 15:51:01 It sure is. Used French fry oil that is
4117 2018-03-22 15:50:47 and sunflower oil too I think
4118 2018-03-22 15:50:37 Yes, you can breed oil seed rape to produce insecticide, without GE methods.
4119 2018-03-22 15:50:27 Don't get me wrong. I've been going to the same place for years. I trust them. They weren't trying to rip me off with my old car. It had real problems and it leaked oil from everywhere, which is why I got a new car last year.

The Euro Zone has to do it as well & they eventually will because RUS keeps meddling in their affairs. Going to be fun!

4189 2018-03-22 15:43:40 There’s not a great deal of difference, mainly:
PDK oil changes are due every 6 yrs, will cost £370 inc VAT labour & parts. Manual will need a clutch & dual mass flywheel change costing approx. £1500, however in most cases this will not be until the car reaches 50-60,000 miles!

4199 2018-03-22 15:43:17 they aren't putting weed in their products. they use hempseed oil like a LOT of other brands, it's not weed related. the products that DO have cannabis oil are openly known to have such, and there's even a leaf on the bottle. read the statement.
4200 2018-03-22 15:43:03 HEMP SEED OIL does not contain THC and in general, hemp seed oil is very beneficial to the skin.

4224 2018-03-22 15:40:18 Cleansing wipes don’t effectively clean the skin. Instead, they just smear dirt, bacteria, oil, and makeup across it. Essentially it is like applying cleanser to your face with soap then not washing it off #skincare

4242 2018-03-22 15:38:35 I slept thru my appt yesterday for an oil change and everywhere I call is telling me an hour wait... I do not got the time for that sway
4243 2018-03-22 15:38:23 I’m 21 and I’m lucky to get 2-3 hours of sleep a night. I love my coffee and I work 7 days a week, does that mean we get to skip and get coffee first?! Sorry I have 40+ guys on an oil site to watch over 
4244 2018-03-22 15:38:07 Truly an odd dream.

I dreamt I got a job in the oil sands and my DMGE went undeveloped and I became 60 overnight and then I died.

Nightmare.  I had a nightmare.

4248 2018-03-22 15:37:16 Self care tip #2!

Make sure to keep your face (including your lips) moisturized, especially in the winter time when the air can be dry. Staying hydrated can help with this. A natural moisturizer you can use on your lips is coconut oil!

4250 2018-03-22 15:37:09 If they use hemp oil in two other products and they have stated that upon release why would they put it in an existing product and not say. It doesn’t make sense and it doesn’t make business sense. Has yours smelt of weed? Because I’m pretty sure these people are lying tbh

4256 2018-03-22 15:36:19 Being the GM is never easy. Finding culture fits & those who do things to fit in by “working on their development” is important. No player should be indispensable. Some here in #Oil uniform HAVE to be moved. That’s the only way forward.
4257 2018-03-22 15:35:59 He's pumping oil and natural gas into Europe, hurting Putin badly.  Of course the media wouldn't dare report that.  Would hurt the narrative.
4258 2018-03-22 15:35:51 2.He is ignoring the fact that Turkey is occupying half of Kurdish land & turkish economy is able to move on due to Kurdish resources this include oil and water. An independent Kurdistan much more beneficial to U.S & EU to compare to despotic & dictatorship of Jihadist Turkey.

4333 2018-03-22 15:29:33 I agree its been great for your country,England,,not good for Scotland,and I don't see how you can argue that is has been good for scots given that 92% of oil and gas revenues go elsewhere
4334 2018-03-22 15:29:31 March 26th, China will allow large-scale exchange of oil for gold. Interesting times ahead. Buy gold while you still can.

4453 2018-03-22 15:17:21 I had an epiphany this morning while i was driving to get my oil change.
4454 2018-03-22 15:17:17 I'm terrible at substitution - I usually just use less of whatever it is. A spray would probably keep the eggs from sticking, or oil, but I'm not sure that milk would be a good substitute for the cream. I use milk in scrambled eggs, though, so worth a try!

4468 2018-03-22 15:15:57 The question that I have yet see answered: how much of $1.54 a litre is profit for the oil companies in the production chain, and is it a reasonable return?  Somehow that number is never included on the tax stickers on the pumps. @MikeKlassen
4469 2018-03-22 15:15:46 Guy you got busted kenan
4470 2018-03-22 15:15:45 I know it's controversial, but I do not rub it down with a little bit of oil. If you keep it well cleaned/seasoned, and use enough oil while cooking, you can avoid this step. Oil can become sticky and gross if you rub it on at the end. I have 3 pans and this has worked so far
4471 2018-03-22 15:15:45 Yep. I remember those loyalty oaths. Too many fine Xtian GOPers went right along with that without blinking. Made this vet twitch at the very idea. MF I pledge alliegiance already & put my name on the dotted line- my loyalty is to this country and not some oil man’s son

4501 2018-03-22 15:12:56 Your comparing Norway to UK not Scotland. Scotland has similar amounts of oil and population. An independent Scotland would also export most of its oil.

3) It will also strengthen dollar, above 65.5 it is a big worry for us.

4737 2018-03-22 14:45:06 I hope you have a spatter gauged to protect from the hot oil
4738 2018-03-22 14:45:04 Only makes me wonder why @ccaryl is so eager to have us forget a corrupt data company used by Trump, Blunt, Cotton, Cruz and Tillis, who also gave the same US voter data to Lukoil, a Russian oil company. Who were they the middleman for?
4739 2018-03-22 14:44:58 She probably things a big oil painting is worth more than a small one #spittingimage

4741 2018-03-22 14:44:36 @StormieJenny #Trump has business w/Russia. Trump has also been working w/Saudi Arabia, Russia, Turkey, China regarding oil & selling major fire arms. Plus his hotels/golf courses are used for money laundering his M.O. Earth shattering is selling out his country! #TrumpIsAPig

4746 2018-03-22 14:43:58 That's a bad idea because we need the experienced ones to ward off the lobbyists going after the new fish. You don't want oil/finance/defense/pharma/etc lobbyists going after the new fish, right?

4750 2018-03-22 14:43:50 why oil?
because itsa fossil fuel (dead dinosaurs)
apparently there's value to old stuff
*winks*
time creates value

so, yes;

4755 2018-03-22 14:43:08 Costs 2k-5k a day. (House vs Senate) those are stats before citizens United, tho. 

The difference between Reps and Dems is oil lobby vs banking lobby.

Neither typically care about issues of the working class.

4774 2018-03-22 14:39:51 Maybe. Anything made from oil or trees can be made directly from CO2 as well, with higher conversion efficiency. 

Also higher cost.

For now.

4788 2018-03-22 14:37:56 It's time to admit that the @GOP is destroying our country. They're financially screwing our citizens, raping our beautiful lands for oil, supporting a traitor, & baldly ignoring the wishes of their constituents. It's time to see that and realize how important it is to vote blue
4789 2018-03-22 14:37:40 I take a long hot shower first.  Also, shaving cream gets too messy.  I use shaving oil instead.
4790 2018-03-22 14:37:37 @chicksonright I have pain daily - maybe I can get a CBD oil IV and drag it around like at the hospital...
4791 2018-03-22 14:37:25 Oh please! It is the White Liberal elite, the most naive people, taking us to a 2nd Cold War with Russia over BS. This will cost us 10's of $ trillions. Russia could place nukes in Cuba, Venezuela, veto all UN  initiatives in Security Council, arms race, ship oil to North Korea.
4792 2018-03-22 14:37:25 Cause Bush/Cheney bullshit battles cost a trillion a year dude.  Guess we forget about that little Rep failure that is still  running up the tab today.  And Cheney still didn’t get his oil!

4797 2018-03-22 14:36:46 Olive oil is the Windex of French culture. Dry hands? Olive oil. Creaky joints? Olive oil. Tasteless food? Olive oil? Cooking anything? Olive oil. It's the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

4832 2018-03-22 14:32:01 Food and metals (like steel), are the two sectors where subsidies and tariffs make sense. It’s a matter of national security to make your own food, steel and oil. Otherwise you’re a sitting duck in a world war.
4833 2018-03-22 14:31:43 Indy Eleven is playing in Lucas Oil this year lol. They used to play at IUPUI's soccer field. I'm guessing AAF aims higher for venues. IUPUI seats ~12k and there's really nothing higher than that other than Lucas Oil

4884 2018-03-22 14:25:32 This is ridiculous. No fight between these two should happen unless it’s done in the original Greek Olympics style ... all oil, no clothes. Enjoy that visual in your head :)

4887 2018-03-22 14:25:22 @AubreyMarcus @Onnit your products are great. I’ve verified thru blood test the superiority of your mct oil. But the shipping costs suck. A sub plan w/free shipping would be better than 10% off +$8 shipping thru usps IMO. I order thru amazon or google -2 day free shipping.
4888 2018-03-22 14:24:59 In Trump's Poland speech the President openly claimed that America's interest in Eastern Europe was to seize what is now Russia's European oil market and replace it with U.S. Corporate heating fuels (at several times the cost).

4903 2018-03-22 14:24:04 it shouldn't be "drinking oil"... Unless you just mean oil changes. If you have to add oil between changes something might be wrong.

4909 2018-03-22 14:23:28 Please take my oil I don't need it anymore
4910 2018-03-22 14:23:26 weird.

coconut oil is supposed to be very shelf stable which is why it's so popular in hot climates.

btw, tjmaxx usually has BIG jars of organic for <$10
4911 2018-03-22 14:23:19 I need a oil change, wheel alignment, new tires, a tune up! Like wtf ?! Where’s is my bf when I need one?! I don’t wanna do this shit! Then places be trynna get down on you

4918 2018-03-22 14:22:29 why do oil changes take so long? is this what being an adult feels like? bored, frustrasted and hungry? if so, I don’t want it.
4919 2018-03-22 14:22:11 Ok, so someone in Greeley Co is leaking Major Car Motor oil...it's time for a new car. Go to GREELEY SUBARU, ask for Brandon Jones. He'll get you in a new affordable car. Tell him Tammi Bonde sent you.

4935 2018-03-22 14:19:19 My wife likes cooking shows so we tuned into @177MilkStreet and saw a suggestion to cook scrambled eggs in olive oil. I'll try almost anything once but I won't try that twice. #butter is better. Alt suggestion - try a dash of corn starch while whisking the eggs,
4936 2018-03-22 14:19:14 @JohnDukeWayne did Duke ever play any "contemporary" roles? The only one I remember is Hellfighters. Its based on Red Adair. He's very well known here in Scotland as he had to be called in to put out the fire when the Piper Alpha oil rig exploded years ago
4937 2018-03-22 14:19:11 Hey you want some of that.....anxiety oil. I got the goods. Here, you can take it right off of my greasy face.
4938 2018-03-22 14:19:03 I love the internet. But internet exceptionalism is a myth. Big Tech is no different than Big Oil, Big Pharma, or any other group of corporate entities seeking to maximize profits at the expense of all else, including the common good.

4949 2018-03-22 14:17:10 $USDCAD recovers early lost ground to 1-1/2 week lows, back to the 1.29 mark. A goodish USD rebound helps rebound around 70-pips from intraday lows. Weaker #oil prices further weigh on commodity-linked #Loonie.
4950 2018-03-22 14:17:03 The imperialist forces are smiling all the way to the bank getting that cheap Libyan oil & selling arms to those militia's. They are trying to a similar regime change in Venezuela, they want that oil !
4951 2018-03-22 14:17:02 It started in 2004...but it's President Trump's agenda?

5069 2018-03-22 14:02:22 Shares of oil exploration and production companies gained. Reliance  Industries (RIL) (up 1.22%) and ONGC (up 2.45%) gained. Higher crude oil  prices would result in increase in realizations from crude sales for  oil exploration firms.

5079 2018-03-22 14:01:39 I believe @urwah_nyongo when she says the bahi owner tweeted about weed being in the sunflowerseed serum. Maybe the owner didn’t mean weed. Maybe hemp oil, but urwah just not going to lie about it and if the owner didn’t say it. She wouldn’t have deleted the tweet.
5080 2018-03-22 14:01:34 Yeah right. Continue to deny the fact and construct a "just war" excuse for destroying Iraq, and stealing its 75% of its oil. Iraq had an infrastructure to market its oil happily before the infrastructure was bombed by the illegal invasion. Much victim blaming on your side atm.

5136 2018-03-22 13:54:17 SB21 and these oil credits have been the biggest state-killing racket in recent history. “Promises” of bigly increased production and revenue were as empty as companies’ bank loan repayments. #akleg
5137 2018-03-22 13:54:07 He still lectures in Russia. Are you also buying Cambridge's BS about Lukoil, which is a Russian oil company, contracting with them on American voting behaviors for the purpose of determining how Turkish citizens respond to gas loyalty cards? That's what they told NYT.
5138 2018-03-22 13:53:58 Please Kurt enlighten us with how he is conservative and not an over glorified snake oil salesman saying and doing what will get him the most support?

5147 2018-03-22 13:53:20 The oil and gas industry is burying pipelines all over the country trying to lock us into decades more drilling and fracking. Eventually all the pipelines will rot and leak and blow up. We need to stop this now.
5148 2018-03-22 13:53:15 Land and the minerals/gas/oil/coal in it is not going to move elsewhere. Still don’t understand why Rinehart/Forrest actually get subsidies at all.

5153 2018-03-22 13:52:46 you're thinking facebook boss mark zuckerberg is a modern day snake oil salesman. saying what people want to hear but knowing that what he is pitching isn't what's in the bottle. what needs to change: fb's definition: from being a platform to a media co.
5154 2018-03-22 13:52:44 congrats OIL KING!
5155 2018-03-22 13:52:42 We need oil! All plastic is made from petroleum and plastic is used almost everywhere: in cars, houses, toys, computers and clothing. Asphalt used in road construction is a petroleum product as is the synthetic rubber in the tires.
5156 2018-03-22 13:52:36 Crony corrupt capitalism at its finest.  How about mandating a long term plan to secure SC energy generation and transmission and bury all transmission lines within 25 years.  And South Carolina should lead the SE US in offshore oil drilling #NUFFSAID
5157 2018-03-22 13:52:33 Knuckle Bash is a VERY homo erotic game, the way the characters muscles are drawn, especially on the title screen and knockout mini game, slathered in oil, has a highly fetishistic feel to it, reminiscent of Cho Aniki 
5158 2018-03-22 13:52:32 3) Is their precedent for the NEB to withdraw those permits once #TMX has been built if the terms of the original NEB granting of the permits aren’t followed?
(Again with respect to how the the existing pipeline is supposed to be repurposed primarily for refined oil transport...)
5159 2018-03-22 13:52:11 We’re black and white, oil and water, I don’t know how to make this work.
5160 2018-03-22 13:52:02 US markets awash in red, to start the day. #DOW down by a percent.

5161 2018-03-22 13:51:59 Kakadu C Serum if you're wanting to use it during the daytime because it layers better with cosmetics (can also use in pm with a moisturizer). The Evening Oil is great for nighttime or for more dry, more mature skin types.

5166 2018-03-22 13:51:25 Interesting. What about oil rent distribution ? Do you think even though oil revenues got erratic, oil revenues helped cope with high unemployment rates in post-rev Libya or people mostly invested informal activities such as migrant or fuel smuggling? (especially in South Libya)

5174 2018-03-22 13:50:28 The information about the Mayan Heavy Crude is very interesting. The pipeline is a terrible idea, but I never considered the possibility that there would be no better price for a barrel of oil. I hope this gets wide circulation.
5175 2018-03-22 13:50:27 Ultimately, your husband will be a slave in the socialist "paradise."

I suspect the 10 hours a week is an average and not the actual rate for every person. Doctors will work 120 hours a week (full of speed) to offset the 2-5 hours worked by the state's propagandists.

Oh, busy killing off 17% of our GDP (our reliable, safe and environmentally responsible oil and gas industry, third largest supplies in the world, our birthright of riches that can fund a cornucopia of social programs for the needy&disadvantaged).
5181 2018-03-22 13:49:36 I don’t think publicly controlled, collectively owned energy assets could possibly match privately owned oil companies in terms of greed and selfishly driven long term damage. What would be greedy about less concentration and greater distribution of the benefits of extraction?

5199 2018-03-22 13:46:23 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC & signed permits for big oil to drill in the Arctic!

5208 2018-03-22 13:44:38 This is a rip off by the oil industry and excessive federal, provincial and Tra nslink taxes.  The real annoying piece is that the taxes at the federal and provincial levels go into general revenue instead of into BC transportation infrastructure.
5209 2018-03-22 13:44:32 Phew. I was worried about the Oil & Gas industry

5213 2018-03-22 13:44:13 Yes. The whole crooked @realDonaldTrump project is to extract as much dirty money as possible from oil/coal/shale/gas, while there is still time, regardless of the environmental destruction.

That's why they have @EPAScottPruitt at the @EPA

5232 2018-03-22 13:42:27 Think what car insurance covers.

Doesn’t cost $8,000 a year, Nationwide competitive market. No governmental car insurance “Carcare”

5235 2018-03-22 13:42:12 There is not debate. The Chevron lawyer is acknowledging this fact. He is making the case Chevron only supplies oil, and it's those who burn it that are contributing to climate change. His argument can be defeated if Chevron is proven to also fund disinformation about AGW.
5236 2018-03-22 13:42:09 I am more aware when I'm buying products not trying to buy that palm oil stuff and other Nasties that damage the environment it's hard but I'm slowly just looking to replace each item on the everyday list with safer products that are as cost effective @ECOWARRIORSS

5239 2018-03-22 13:41:57 I wouldn't want to guess the price impact, but it would be probably in the few tens of cents range - not likely pennies or dollars. Probably not signficant for global gas markets, or domestic oil producers, but would cut into domestic gas producer margins.

5292 2018-03-22 13:35:53 In a higher oil scenario, you could see that shift much more towards liquids plays production. Absent major LNG FIDs in near term, the domestic gas market demand growth is limited, so supply curve shifts leftwards.
5293 2018-03-22 13:35:45 Thank you
5294 2018-03-22 13:35:36 Hard for me not to come across as a whatabouter when discussing this. I agree with you just saying we have to be careful, at my university they drove away businessmen from a conference on campus just because they were related to oil companies. I hate Nazis as well!
5295 2018-03-22 13:35:30 Reasons to buy non-latex condoms:
1. They’re less prone to breakage, slippage, and noticeability
2. Oil doesn’t break them down (polyurethane)
3. People like me are allergic to latex lol

5301 2018-03-22 13:34:40 This is why everybody is frackin' and pumpin' oil like there's no tomorrow. Because there isn't a tomorrow for fossil fuels. I only hope there's a world left for us to enjoy when our renewable future arrives.

5422 2018-03-22 13:20:15 I'm hoping this is all leading up to a Turkish Oil wrestling duel.
5423 2018-03-22 13:20:09 You don't want to miss some exciting news. I go live in 15 minutes on my business page, so see you there.  Lorraine O. Lopez essential oil education.
5424 2018-03-22 13:20:05 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5425 2018-03-22 13:19:57 I agree, I thunk the lower mainland needs to actually see what it's like to have the oil tap shut off. So many seem to think they will be ok, and have plans to rely on trips accross the boarder. They have no idea....
5426 2018-03-22 13:19:56 Yup, I love hempseed oil and butter. I think what set this off was her tweet last month to that lady that she already had cannabis based products.

5438 2018-03-22 13:18:19 Detestable Oil companies have raised prices in BC to pretend that "gas is running out" hoping that a fooled population will "demand pipelines in every neighbourhood" and tankers in every inlet. 

▓▓▓▓▓ you oil companies.
Premier Horgan, maybe BC should set oil prices like NS
5439 2018-03-22 13:18:15 The economy has been growing after Obama got us out of the recession. Give the tax plan a few years. Companies are using their windfall to do stock buy backs. And it's adding over a trillion to the deficit. I don't see making national monuments smaller so oil companies can drill.
5440 2018-03-22 13:18:08 And plastic is a product of Big Oil which obstructs any reduction whatsoever.

5445 2018-03-22 13:17:39 No oil fields in Afrin; Turkey is taking out Afrin because it was isolated from rest of areas ruled Kurds, to protect the rebel forces it supports on Turkish border & connect them to the rebel (and al-Qaeda) held territories in the Idlib province.

5456 2018-03-22 13:16:00 I had some Papa John's pizza yesterday and it was okay.  The thin crust was better than the original crust but both were kind of dry.  They should try adding more olive oil and cheese.  Just some suggestions.
5457 2018-03-22 13:15:56 I mean if she put hemp on the label and the plant on the label that’s pretty standard. EYE wouldn’t have just called it “weed” like ever, so I’m not caping for that. I’m just here to tell people that hemp oil ain’t that and to give some insight on why she mighta did what she did
5458 2018-03-22 13:15:46 No deficit economy under President Clinton.. We established healthcare so big banks couldn't take your homes bcoz healthcare was for the rich to live much time long hoard monies. Belonging to New ideas.. Solar energy electric cars no oil no wars do you think Trump wants us dead?
5459 2018-03-22 13:15:36 That's ridiculous. I spend less than half of that on my beauty coconut oil (different than my cheaper cooking coconut oil.) My one caution about buying large jars: I have had coconut oil go rancid before, making it less effective for either purpose.

Now sanctions gears have been shifted to oil sector, I am still waiting from him, whether to loan out his weapons or not.

5472 2018-03-22 13:14:21 It's terrible if Henry or Adams pick something else other than AFC but Arteta off to an oil club which made it far harder for loverboy Wenger to compete? Oh, I'll forgive that no problem & I hope he becomes next AFC coach. There is a hypocrisy & cognitive dissonance in that.

5522 2018-03-22 13:09:15 How has the Russian economy not collapsed at this point? Isn’t the price of oil still falling? Didn’t they default on all their debt in the last decade? How is this possible?

5534 2018-03-22 13:07:56 I do not know if we should threaten sanctions over this.  The time is near & will be evident to the world, the staggering amount of oil & gas the U.S. has.  We will become a major exporter & make trillions.  Energy independence will be for the U.S., Canada, and Israel. (IMHO)
5535 2018-03-22 13:07:50 So your increasing the costs of our over inflated i military, spending our tax money on a wall after you said Mexico would pay for it, spending our money on prisons your buddies own, our money to create more oil pipelines through nature reservations, and you still say tax cuts?

5551 2018-03-22 13:06:03 It's bullshit.
Not attributing oil & gas exports to Scotland is like saying the City of London doesn't contribute to England. You need to learn more about trade and economics before publishing a verdict.

5563 2018-03-22 13:04:55 This is by far the most juvenile post I have seen. You have sunk so low you must be about to strike oil.
5564 2018-03-22 13:04:46 Getting the oil changed in my car. Always make me nervous. I feel like the mechanic is gonna say, “Hey look, this car is awful. Just awful”.
5565 2018-03-22 13:04:45 こちらこそよろしくお願いします。何かお役に立つような事が書いてありましたかね…。
5566 2018-03-22 13:04:43 Probably because lots of consumers don’t know the difference either. So if she says weed instead of hemp oil she thinks she’s doing right by giving them a heads up when they google hemp and find out its from the cannabis plant

5575 2018-03-22 13:04:01 Thanks I'm glad you replied as confirms what I thought (I wasn't sure about the roller remover but @allnuttclocks also agreed) I also thought 4th jewelling related - perhaps @DrStruthers @StruthersWatch may know for what use? The oil pot was there because I just really like them!
5576 2018-03-22 13:03:46 no. you use it to oil your vegetables before you eat them .

5645 2018-03-22 12:55:35 Cannabis oil for medical purposes should be legalised.  
We all know why it's not is because it's dirt cheap and the drug companies don't want it.
For two reasons first as I said it's cheap. The second is it CURES illness. Drug companies don't want this.
5646 2018-03-22 12:55:32 You don't mix onion and garlic if you can. You don't brown it either, you warm up the oil and when garlic starts frying, add tomato. Or: you brown onions, add tomato, toss a piece of garlic in and cook as long as you want
5647 2018-03-22 12:55:25 This now can show us openly that U.S is looking for vacancy in the oil field that why its imposing sanctions on the oil companies operating in @SouthSudan. But we’re not going to give them chance to get in, this is our own resource.

5662 2018-03-22 12:53:26 Pretty simple solution:  filtrate water pipelines similar to oil pipelines that store rain and snowfall, transfer water where needed.  Expensive, but could save the world.

5672 2018-03-22 12:52:11 Crude oil prices were also boosted by comments from President Trump reiterating that he may withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, which raises the risk of Iran’s crude exports being curbed by renewed sanctions.
5673 2018-03-22 12:52:05 Crude oil prices were boosted by a weaker dollar and the unexpected -2.62 million bbl decline in EIA crude inventories versus expectations for a build of +3.0 million bbl.

When you have NOTHING to show for 11 trillion borrowed, oil selling at 65 dollars per barrel, Nigerians buying fuel at 145 naira per liter whereas they bought 87 per liter under PDP, when your STUPID DOLLAR POLICY makes JP Morgan blacklist your country.
5779 2018-03-22 12:35:44 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.

5865 2018-03-22 12:29:53 For the time being, oil is still the basic unit of energy, thus the basic unit of currency.  Remember, the price of oil is not measured in dollars, dollars are measured by the price of joules - and for now that is oil.

5994 2018-03-22 12:12:46 I can remember being in a utilities meeting with a so-called expert at work about 10 years ago.  I asked a question about conserving water and the others at the meeting looked at me as if I were crazy.  I have long thought that water would be the next oil.
5995 2018-03-22 12:12:41 The BJJ community's attachment to intellectually vacuous right-wing crank Jordan Peterson is an issue.

There is a substantial crossover between the often deeply reactionary snake oil self development industry, of which Peterson is a current beau, and the martial art I love.

To say that pipelines (that bring cheaper/cleaner fuel) are "high risk" is just garden variety anti-fossil fuel claptrap.

6055 2018-03-22 12:04:09 Nigeria's Government (at all levels) depend on oil money to function. Take it away, and Government collapses.

Now oil is a finite resource.

But groups like Boko Haram do not.

This is one reason why we should take "diversification of Government revenues" seriously.

6131 2018-03-22 11:55:26 If true my guess is the farmers switch from planting soybeans to planting corn.  Attacking the US agricultural industry is useless they are too resourceful and have successfully negotiated fluctuating oil prices and weather patterns for a long time.
6132 2018-03-22 11:54:46 But as contract employee I had (legitimate) access to emergency control room and could have shut down all North Sea oil production. (1980s when it was bigger than now) /2

6155 2018-03-22 11:52:11 I see where this is going...

Dear @2TomatoesGms,

I was very excited to hear about Peak Oil, a game (I assumed) all about the great Peak District oil rush (begun, as you know, after one of Compo's accidents). Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and couldn't find Hudders...
6156 2018-03-22 11:51:58 I don't think so. ' Huile d"olive ' refers much more to Italian cuisine ( by extent, southern Europe ).  Traditional french cooking oil ( jus de cuisson ( meat cooking juices )) has animal origins.

6273 2018-03-22 11:30:25 See Wikipedia 'oil wells'. the infrastructure alone destroys remote wilderness, water supply, ecology. Building living quarters, roads, pipelines, deforestation. They're a menace. they want #wildhorses out of their way. Zinke announced, 'we should be public land partners'.
6274 2018-03-22 11:30:25 Oh honey I’ve got you! Heat them up in a frying pan on the stove top. I add in a bit off olive oil, salt, and rosemary and you’ve got yourself a whole new lease of life on those chips!

6289 2018-03-22 11:28:40 This accounts only for heart risk. It does not account for its nutritional values, its benefits in other health markers. Unsaturated fatty acids have the nasty possibility of oxidizing. That is why most of civilizations thrived on meat/palm oil/coconut oil.

Kasi sila nagbebenifit dun. Pag dto sa Pinas yan, pag may nagcomment na bansa, pinoy sigurado baback upan yung bansa na nagcomment.
6311 2018-03-22 11:24:09 Having to put olive oil in my ear twice a day is comfortably the weirdest thing I’ve done.
6312 2018-03-22 11:23:44 I wish that was the issue in my kitchen. I have to either put my coconut oil in a hot water bath or dip a metal spoon into boiling water first. Spring is here, hopefully things will change soon.

6355 2018-03-22 11:15:33 and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil.

6544 2018-03-22 10:47:33 @Morning_Joe It is incredible how Democrats are under constant attack even when not in power, NPR attacked Perez yesterday. Big attack of Pelosi and Schumer as "old" well we need the experience of living thru the Viet Nam war and oil embargos and the rise of GOP ie crazy Reagan!!

6546 2018-03-22 10:47:04 Well the linoleum industry isn't doing too well at the moment Stephen - but we seem to be expanding our exports -) Let's leave oil - that terrible drain on our economy - out of the picture just  for now -)
6547 2018-03-22 10:47:01 i don't get the hype with micellar water. i bought it cause of all the reviews and i hate it. oil cleansing removes my makeup thoroughly with far less product. now i gotta finish my bottle of micellar water before switching back to oil cleanser 
6548 2018-03-22 10:46:56 Oil wells cause a whole lot of probables on their own with the environment & if you don’t think they take up a lot of room wait until you see the damage they do to your National Parks.

6550 2018-03-22 10:46:33 You need that Eucalyptus imbued UK chewing gum which allows you to breath waves of air, the blue one; lots of tissues, and a diffuser loaded with Eucalyptus oil so you're always in a haze of that stuff.
You may even need a Neti at some point.

6693 2018-03-22 10:21:24 Crude OIL & Natural gas - Expect sharp rally. Crude may hit 100$ in short term. Natural gas may hit 4.5$(ST).

The $1.4 trillion in US tax payers' wages that's been handed over, via the defence budget, to the bombmakers since 9/11 was done as much via Obama.
The 2.4 million killed in Iraq on WMD lies & the oil being looted from there by Big Oil were also bipartisan crimes

6711 2018-03-22 10:18:38 higher high in oil would be the most logic move indeed
6712 2018-03-22 10:18:29 And as countries like Norway show, socialism can fund capitalism too...Entrepreneurs in Norway have access to funding from Norway’s state run oil company profits (invested in sovereign fund now worth $R1trillion) which also largely funds its other social programs.

6832 2018-03-22 09:58:38 If we understand anointing as the pouring of oil, then Elijah didn't anoint Elisha. This makes us understand that anointing is not an EVENT but a PROCESS. 1 Kings 19:15-21(NKJV)

6834 2018-03-22 09:58:36 then
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

6992 2018-03-22 09:26:48 No mention in your twitter feed of the need for us to move away from fossil fuels. All I see is persistent promotion of the oil industry. Business as usual. But I guess that's what they pay you for

7000 2018-03-22 09:24:53 No where. Its your appetite, not ours. Somehow our ancestors agreed that cows should not be killed. There r few explanations -
1) It is dairy animal. From milk, ghee(oil from cow milk), cheese, it provides everything.
2) It is an animal which has emotions just like dogs.

I think humans sometimes have difficulty expressing what they mean. They exaggerate, use hyperbole, use 'many' when 'mean 'few'. Saying 'lying' -as we know far too well on twitter, is oil on fire.

7146 2018-03-22 08:48:00 I can smell the turmeric and the consistency is like vitamin e oil. I think it’s legit so far. Turmeric really does lighten dark marks, it’s just messy and can stain easily so I personally don’t stick with it. Try making a turmeric face mask and see if it works for your skin type

If "rules of the Union" for UK were same as for EU then Westminster would not get 2 prevent Scots from:

 - hold a Referendum
 - ban Trident
 - decide Oil Tax rules
 - set Immigration rules
 - change borrowing policy
 - Financial Regs
 - Industrial Support strategy

7236 2018-03-22 08:30:27 Actually in the ongoing case in Northern California, the lawyer for Chevron stated very clearly that they and other oil companies fully accept the mainstream climate science. Unlike the libertarian nutjobs that make up the vast majority of climate change deniers.

There's a huge amount of oil in South Africa that hasn't been discovered yet. It's waiting to be taken.

7351 2018-03-22 08:03:57 If it did mention plant based milk I would have bought that, it didn't, like coconut milk, it's not mentioned on the list, coconut is mentioned as a fruit food group, as a oil food group, as a nut food group, so more the meat or water like for in smoothies or something.

7375 2018-03-22 07:59:19 FACTS & FIGURES: In terms of effectiveness, #OILEX is a true heavyweight. With just 7kg per 50 liters (140 grams per liter) it is also especially light. This makes handling and disposal extremely efficient and transport is trouble-free.
7376 2018-03-22 07:59:17 It needs some oil. Where’s Jonathan Van Ness when you need him?
7377 2018-03-22 07:59:04 Yes but it begs the question; how many acres of deforested land do you use for your palm oil supply? Why use palm oil at all? A lot of your competitors don’t.
7378 2018-03-22 07:59:00 Sugar ??? A dollop of coconut oil ??? The opportunities are endless
7379 2018-03-22 07:58:52 Try tea trea oil babe
7380 2018-03-22 07:58:37 Only time will tell us the definitive answer on who won this deal.  It is a fool's errand to declare winners and losers so prematurely.  At this time, I am comfortable with the Oil getting a developing RW prospect over a 3rd rd pick in '19.
7381 2018-03-22 07:58:35 Pathetic grown man. How has your oil developed your nation and how much has it made the standard of living better for the masses? How has it reduced unemployment in your oil-rich nation? Crazy!

7386 2018-03-22 07:55:54 I love the Burt’s bees oil lip gloss because you can kiss your mans without him getting mad sticky and still be poppin
7387 2018-03-22 07:55:19 says the one who pays $600 for an oil change
7388 2018-03-22 07:54:58 So that $1.6B came from Mexico right? We have been told over and over that Mexico is paying for the wall. So how many Trump supporters will acknowledge that was a LIE?

7392 2018-03-22 07:53:27 I got mine removed in January! I had them for over 2.5 years. I used a lash serum on them, castor oil, and I took some vitamins. The next week I went and got them curled and that made me feel much better about my tiny baby lashes. You’re gorgeous either way!!

7394 2018-03-22 07:52:52 So uhhhh turns out iPhones survive if they're dropped in a pool of oil. 

Don't ask me how I found out.
7395 2018-03-22 07:52:47 Don't expect linseed oil from those you malign.
7396 2018-03-22 07:52:36 Trump will allow saudi to bomb Yemen to point of a complete destruction - not a concern 

His agenda is Iran - so there is a common agreement to supply arms to SA then ignore the genocide 

As more middle east -- what next - IRAN sanctions next - OIL price up 
USA/SAUDI happy

7406 2018-03-22 07:50:29 THE OIL CANS ARE DEFECTIVE
7407 2018-03-22 07:50:18 It’s not all aggression Molly. Efficacy is pretty central as it determines the nature of the story. Many credible analysts point out they could be mere snake oil salesmen. Mercer’s judgement isn’t infallible. And when microtargetting is used by someone we like (Obama) ...

7409 2018-03-22 07:49:58 China switching to cryptos in under a weeks time to trade oil is absolutely redicilous and makes no sense because they do not have a national or government crypto platform in place.  It will happen eventually but we are years off that.
7410 2018-03-22 07:49:44 I have the best oil blend gor my hair. It feels so good 
7411 2018-03-22 07:49:37 I'd like to know what the Governor will commit to doing to keep fossil fuels from being transported through or refined in our state, including the oil currently being shipped from Port of Portland & the proposed #JordonCoveLNG facility that's been proposed. The coal threats, too.
7412 2018-03-22 07:49:30 This is clear indication of oil company's fear of political correctness. 
Climate change is the perfect pseudoscientific theory for liberal big government because the theory can never be fully disproved.
The #1 goal of #ClimateChange activists is to weaken #CAPITALISM
7413 2018-03-22 07:49:29 Chi, noone is questioning your day-trading skills nor try to teach you your game. Don't you think you shouldn't try to teach macro thinkers their game either? So far he is spot on on the bear usd, while you are bearish oil since mid 40s. Will all due respect!

7655 2018-03-22 07:01:03 You know that all those times you splurge on essential oils is worth it when your kid asked you to rub some on oil him when he has stomach ache or when he has a nose blockage. 
7656 2018-03-22 07:01:03 sa SM, wala ako nakita baka ma-disappoint ka sa sasabihin ko kasi Sunflower cooking oil lang nakita ko doon

7660 2018-03-22 07:00:21 Lol. It's all politics. They know how to keep the masses in poverty and then promise them basic amenities to sway their votes in their favor. A bag of rice and keg of oil will buy votes. Nigerians are quick to forget once bribe is involved.

7668 2018-03-22 06:57:27 So I bought lavender oil and lemon oil. Put a few drops of each on a cotton ball inside of each of my ears... when I say doing this is THE ONLY THING THAT MADE ME FEEL BETTER. Ears, throat, chest, all that cleared up in minutessss

7694 2018-03-22 06:51:34 Is wike in charge of the oil? Is wike ion charge of the security? Is wike in charge of the water ways? You are channeling your complains wrongly. Talk to those at the Federal level.

7705 2018-03-22 06:48:25 Unlike the snake oil merchants CA,  nobody has accused Aristotle Inc. of harvesting personal information from any social media platform and using them to influence elections of any country. That is the difference.
7706 2018-03-22 06:48:20 And much like the EU, Scotland would like to continue receiving a disproportionate share of someone else's (my) pie with minimal accountability and a 'pick & choose' policy on things (keep NS oil £, not pay for uni tuition etc)
7707 2018-03-22 06:48:03 “What are we working for the hulk now? Why do I smell baby oil?”
7708 2018-03-22 06:48:02 i did but since it was motor oil not all of it came off. i’m going to have to wait a while to bathe him again since dawn can irritate dog’s skin if used too much even diluted
7709 2018-03-22 06:47:30 I still say time now to look at the root cause of the Toxic Air Politicians saying one thing and doing another because they have been bribed sorry Lobbied by Oil and Gas. To counter this Groups have to have a Counter Measure, present a Clean energy fuel system Hydrogen
7710 2018-03-22 06:47:21 i bleached the excess oil out of my hair and now it like feels like hair instead of some gross shit wow
7711 2018-03-22 06:47:07 Let's not be too hard on Tillerson, he's probably hating himself right now. He went from heading a major oil company to working for an insane clown who had him fired while he was on the crapper. He must be filled with a lot of self loathing.
7712 2018-03-22 06:47:02 Actually, in my 40 years' experience here, the biggest problem (and, I think, the [excellent] reason for the slow driving in rain) is the many, many months of no rain.  This leads to a huge layer of grease and oil, which in the winter rains, turns into a slurry of death.

7725 2018-03-22 06:44:03 I agree. Someone told me the other day that they fought for my #freedom to protest against the #NRA. I called bullshit. Not since #WWII has the #UnitedStates gone to war for a noble reason. We don't go to #war for "freedom." We do it for oil, $, and defense contractors.

7731 2018-03-22 06:42:52 But Zero emissions cars need to be joined by Zero emissions Houses  5 x worse than cars and Generating stations which are being steered to Gas. The base of the problem is accepting that Oil & Gas is supported by Politicians Look at Germany Politicians ignoring a Court Decision
7732 2018-03-22 06:42:14 I thought that was due to the higher cost of oil?
7733 2018-03-22 06:41:57 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7734 2018-03-22 06:41:37 I will. Did you look up how much oil from Canada crosses at Sumas via the present pipeline ?  I went. Hmmmm!

7742 2018-03-22 06:40:20 I'm not understanding why oil is down. Isn't demand back to being at an all time high, higher than 07/08? I know we have more supply (US, Canada, Iran, Iraq etc) but does that more than makeup for the demand?

7746 2018-03-22 06:38:33 I think that we got into Iraq because Saddam was selling oil off the dollar standard, and Iraq has enough oil to make the world not bother with the dollar anymore. Some thing had to be done, not what Bush did, but something.

7755 2018-03-22 06:37:07 Oil companies admit to what is best for them at that moment. Al off them are trying to get a green image. Why? To sell more.

7757 2018-03-22 06:36:47 They actually said DEMAND for fossil fuels is the problem. "Boutrous...didn’t accept blame, pointing the finger instead at the people who burned the fossil fuels. In other words, oil doesn’t cause climate change. People burning oil cause climate change."

7772 2018-03-22 06:32:28 Indeed. Data is the new oil. Wars will be fought over it, mark my words.

7774 2018-03-22 06:31:27 In a nutshell it's about a low-level private investigator who must protect a spoiled reality show heiress from an oil executive who would stop at nothing to use her for his plan.
7775 2018-03-22 06:31:25 Black castor oil works wonders as well! I use it on my brows and lashes.
7776 2018-03-22 06:31:08 Pockets are a good idea too. And they’re like constantly filled with tiny bottles of machine oil and whatever parts are small enough to actually fit into them

7823 2018-03-22 06:21:41 You have to look at interests of both sides. If Turkey captures the whole border from YPG, it will not hurt US interests at all, that's why US allowed Afrin to fall. In the other hand, Turkey considers YPG as the biggest current threat. US will be happy with DeirEzzor oil fields.

7944 2018-03-22 05:55:50 I think you are missing a big part of this picture...Rosneft Oil.  19% being sold anonymously  Rex Tillerson named SOS until he turned on his buddy Putin.  45 put America up for sale. 45 and Putin are colluding not then but NOW. .
7945 2018-03-22 05:55:45 There’s oil in BC but true enough not enough to eliminate our debt. But there is an est 300 trillion cu ft of recoverable gas in the Liard Basin for ie. then there’s the Horn River,Cordova ,Montenay as well Ekwan ,Jean Marie,Kyklo etc... the list goes on.
7946 2018-03-22 05:55:40 1. Oh I see. Your vigilance for objective justice and concern about “fraction-based” treatment are commendable. Be that as it may, it would not be misguided to continue to question a sale of strategic fuel assets of a country that’s a net importer of oil.
7947 2018-03-22 05:55:09 Or shall we stop buying oil and gas from Russia ??? Oh no , perhaps not .. because we actually need it !! It’s all a game that politicians play.. a word game that looks good on paper but in reality business is done “behind the scenes “ all the time ! Why pick on sport !

7978 2018-03-22 05:46:44 Each side agreed that greenhouse gases are more important  than water vapor in warming the planet. When all Big Oil companies are  willing to say, clearly and unambiguously, that humans burning fossil fuels are warming the planet, it means the debate has shifted. #climatetutorial
7979 2018-03-22 05:46:43 Forgive me but this is neoliberal clap-trap. The Egyptian Government issues a sovereign currency therefore by definition doesn’t require revenue to “fund” spending. A problem Egypt and other Arab states (without oil revenues) face are debts in currencies they don’t issue.

7981 2018-03-22 05:46:13 Actually Trump’s loosening of oil drilling regulations is flooding the market with oil, which reduces oil prices, Russia’s top export, and severely hurts Russia’s economy. You’re delusional. You’ve been propagandized. Turn off the TV. It’s brain poison.

8001 2018-03-22 05:41:07 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8002 2018-03-22 05:40:57 It's much worse than the data relates...before new oil wells are pipeline in companies like Crescent Point 'tank treat' and vent who knows how many cubic metres of dirty gas to the atmosphere every day. And then there are the Americans.
8003 2018-03-22 05:40:18 China is not doing a Petro crypto. Venezuela did. China is linking oil to Chinese RMB through the Shanghai Gold exchange, thus oil exporting countries can use RMB and buy gold. Remains to be seen if gold can be taken out of China.

8024 2018-03-22 05:35:53 True... but not reality. Girl changing oil should not not even make someone do a double take but you know it does. Not to mention business boys that live in the city and change oil ...now your really pushing it. Spoiler I am a business boy.

8071 2018-03-22 05:25:47 Corruption is not only stealing money,
Corruption is also U using UR position to act nollyhood, playing with the life's of little children, emotionally punishing the parents,guess U finally found oil in the north, in the south we got NNPC and in the north you got BH #DapchiGirls
8072 2018-03-22 05:25:42 On #WorldWaterDay a proper plan should be taken as time demands some change. Can't the refined waters of the rivers help? Or refined water from the sea? If oil can be drilled out of the sea properly, why not water for drinking? Isn't science that much capable yet?
8073 2018-03-22 05:25:27 Betul tan. Dulu tuh mualesss bgt yg namanya cuci muka, lgsg tidur pdhl sunblock dan makeup msh nempel. Kulit muka jd absurd. Skrg, pake oil cleanser/micellar water, maskeran, seruman, pelembab, sunblock, dll. Muka jauh lebih baik dan dimakeupnya jd gampang deh
8074 2018-03-22 05:25:17 astroglide x and gun oil both work incredibly well for me i 100% support them
8075 2018-03-22 05:24:40 Same plant, just the essential oil so it's highly concentrated.
8076 2018-03-22 05:24:31 Of course? The truck is to haul all the gas and two stroke oil

8109 2018-03-22 05:16:29 Jobs lost recently is because these ceo are investing in oil and gas not coal. It was never obama that killed jobs but the CEO of coal companies.
8110 2018-03-22 05:16:25 I wondered WTF was up w/ the spate of Lukoil stations in NYC back then. It was right around the time that Putin came down on Khodorkovsky, so it was clear that he was taking, let’s say, an active hand in RU oil companies.
8111 2018-03-22 05:16:15 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a non-GMO diet, and put some lavender essential oil in my diffuser.
8112 2018-03-22 05:15:57 The travel and tourism sector is set for a modest slowdown in 2018 as a result of higher oil prices and airfares, a year after it experienced its best year on record, according to a leading global industry body.

8114 2018-03-22 05:15:28 EVERYONE can do something. 
Literally just taking your own shopping bags to the grocery store, would help with plastic pollution in our oceans.
Avoiding any food with palm oil in it. Palm oil is bad for your health & contributes to deforestation. 2 small but impactful things.
8115 2018-03-22 05:15:22 My mom’s bf is the most genuine man. He WANTED to do my oil change and when I brought him some cash for the materials he refused the money and says, “Sam, please let me do this...I know you’re not my daughter but I don’t get to do this for my own”

8144 2018-03-22 05:09:51 That is a lie perpetuated by the Olive Oil industry.  Oil is 100% liquid fat that lines and clogs the arteries making us insulin resistant and at risk for heart disease.  PERIOD. Whole olives are healthy, not processed olive OIL.

8208 2018-03-22 04:57:37 I never said private industry should build the refineries but anyways we are having a different argument here about who minimizing environmental risks by refining more of the oil, who should benefit from the resources, etc. That’s a topic for a different thread...

8266 2018-03-22 04:46:47 Slight problem, easy to understand & broadcast. Coal, oil, gas supply 81% world energy. GDP & energy approx linearly related. So everything we own, do or spend 'has energy' in rough proportion to dollar value.  Hence everything we own, do or spend 'has' 81% or so fossil fuels.

8337 2018-03-22 04:33:05 Theres some misunderstanding here. Qadafi wanted  (1) a gold-backed currency and (2) wanted to trade oil in this currency, breaking with the petrodollar. A single currency for single currency sake isnt a problem for the central bankers. Not having control of the supply is.

8349 2018-03-22 04:30:40 Probably quite challenging engaging with affected parties when oil industry reps (including yourself) seem to be fighting tooth and nail to carry on business as usual.

8358 2018-03-22 04:29:39 Sorry that last line should read #TarSands oil could fill Canada’s domestic oil requirements if maximizing profits not #1 goal. If we imported less oil and exported less oil because we refined more of the #tarsands for domestic use, it would reduce risk of transport accidents...
8359 2018-03-22 04:29:31 He's awesome, people in edmonton should rememer, the WHL was strong and he was a big part of the oil kings success the years he was there.
8360 2018-03-22 04:29:30 Can we take a moment to admire the lighting in CMBYN? Every single shot looks like it could be turned into an oil painting.
8361 2018-03-22 04:29:24 @JoannaOhmy1 Hope you get to run  this weekend(It is supposed to be cold and blustery). Have a suggestion for the cold- put olive oil on your legs(and feet,if necessary) to keep warm out there.
8362 2018-03-22 04:29:19 City, outbound traffic affected on Ghodbunder rd since morning after oil spill nr Patlipada, cops, rescue officls on site, diversion imposed
8363 2018-03-22 04:29:02 ya wcw don’t have a skin routine . washes her face with just dove soap & thinks coconut oil solves everything
8364 2018-03-22 04:28:49 Or another mode. I got some medical grade THC infused olive oil and it was completely different than smoking.
8365 2018-03-22 04:28:36 Looks awesome. Somebody is burning that midnight oil tonight. Just another typical 19 hour day for @ryanstewman

8368 2018-03-22 04:27:39 I know! If I had a baby, I wouldn't put a product that used lavender oil on them because of it. (I wish I knew which VOC(s) caused the issue and how to identify other essential oils that contain them.) That's why I'm sharing.

8375 2018-03-22 04:26:10 Coconut oil stinks 
8376 2018-03-22 04:25:39 Elsewhere, energy stocks saw gains due to continued strength in the oil price. ConocoPhillips rose 4.3%, Halliburton advanced 3.6%, and Occidental and Schlumberger both added 3.3%.
8377 2018-03-22 04:25:15 Do you have a minute to talk about our savior, essential oil?

8389 2018-03-22 04:22:55 That’s my concern, if the greatest profitability comes from exporting raw bitumen, then they may decide to not repurpose the existing line for refined oil if it’s more profitable to export raw bitumen. #TarSands oil could fill Canada’s domestic oil requirements if profits not #1
8390 2018-03-22 04:22:51 Mentally exhausted, online classes & testing all day with my oil company. Started at 5am, straight til 3pm, & still have another 16 hours to go. Making it happen, it's what I do....... ;) — feeling accomplished

8392 2018-03-22 04:22:47 It literally sucks ass! But more recently I adopted the oil cleaning method into my routine & its helped my skin (using seasame oil). Incorporating oils (coconut, jojoba, avocado, apricot, & rosehip) have also resolved a lot of my problematic skin issues. Hope this helps!
8393 2018-03-22 04:22:45 Eel oil. Basically same as you with Oranges.
It's ok your not missing much. They are not that great anyway.

8396 2018-03-22 04:22:03 Peter jumped down the streps since you covered them in veggie oil for Steve to slip on.

8399 2018-03-22 04:21:38 Different sources I guess. I will suggest that as soon as we can afford to only use renewable energy we do so. Coal oil and gas are good resources. If something should happen and we need more energy, or just need to go back for some reason, I like knowing its there.
8400 2018-03-22 04:21:18 You lied to us. You told us Mexico would pay. Instead you asked for $18B in the budget. The military did not need rebuilding! You want to abolish our insurance so you can give oil & drug companies free military support
8401 2018-03-22 04:21:09 Whoowhowho,said it for years that’s the the way to get oil and grain to port,I actually thought that was a plan 10,years ago,Edmonton,turtleford,princealbert,hudsonbay,Churchill
8402 2018-03-22 04:20:54 Coconut oil is the key to soft skin. My body feels so good after I use it. 
8403 2018-03-22 04:20:54 also the lube on condoms is usually silicone based as oil can break condoms hence if u can’t use silicone based lube u shouldn’t use the condoms that have lube on them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
8404 2018-03-22 04:20:52 My cat won't stop licking the coconut oil off me like it's some Chick-fil-A Polynesian sauce. 
8405 2018-03-22 04:20:40 The middle of everything is the oil.  Russian Oil, American Oil, Middle Eastern Oil.  Those are the oligarchs vying for control.  The oil oligarchs.   He who controls the oil controls the planet.  Wars cannot be won without adequate oil.
8406 2018-03-22 04:20:04 My mom/I do super simple stuff because we're not THE BEST cooks. 
We bake chicken breasts and I use (if they're not already marinated) olive oil and cajun spices and usually we eat them with frozen veggies sautee'd (olive oil and cajun spice) or put them on top a spinach salad

8417 2018-03-22 04:18:11 Research has proved that toxic chemicals are the reason for today's diseases and cancers. We need our Science and Medical communities to publicly acknowledge this. Companies like Monsanto, Dow Chemicals and Oil companies are keeping people, animals and our environment sick.
8418 2018-03-22 04:18:05 and we don’t need to rebuild the military ? we have one of the largest militaries in the world? like how about we focus on removing our presence from countries we have no business being in so we won’t have to spend our tax dollars funding pointless exercises in “protecting” oil
8419 2018-03-22 04:17:45 Nigerian billionaires are not entrepreneurs. They were created through government patronage(inflated contracts, sharing of oil blocs, monopoly of import licenses, import duty tax waivers, tax loopholes and unpaid bank loans)
8420 2018-03-22 04:17:37 NPR isn’t a liberal bastion. They take  Koch money too. Also, museums, theaters, and other art institutions aren’t liberal safe havens either. They greedily take Koch, Mercer, oil, and fracking money.

8426 2018-03-22 04:16:51 Is there something in the NEB filing that requires TMX to stick to their original pledge to repurpose the existing pipeline for transmitting refined oil? Or could they change the terms and also use it for mostly exporting extra capacity bitumen to maximize profits?

8441 2018-03-22 04:14:23 is there any factual basis to this ‘america makes u buy oil in USD’ or they bomb you’ trope?

8445 2018-03-22 04:14:07 And if I remember McVey used fertilizer and motor oil. Do you propose we ban gardening and lubricants?
8446 2018-03-22 04:14:05 I think we should focus on facts, not insults. Does the NEB process require that TMX stick to the original understanding and use the existing pipe for refined oil transmission after twinning? Important distinction because a corporations goals is to maximize profits...

8456 2018-03-22 04:12:28 Not even close. The socialist government of Venezuela turned to socialism and in doing so eliminated free trade. Because of this, they weren't able to export crude oil. Socialism destroyed the country.

8477 2018-03-22 04:10:21 We should treat bombings -- especially multiple in rapid succession -- as terrorist attacks, not a "misguided youth taking his anger out on the world".

What is the problem with banning firearms? Are they useful in societally constructive manners, like fertilizer or fuel oil are?

8480 2018-03-22 04:09:54 We're always peaceful, and treat everyone with respect. But as they're faced with the existential threat of climate change, you can understand also why people would want to interfere with a discussion about how to find more oil to fuel the climate crisis.
8481 2018-03-22 04:09:49 Yup, it's cow juice or go home here. If you gotta get the milk sugar or the proteins removed, hey, no one's judging.

That being said, I don't mind some tofu now and then. It's those funny Asian genes of mine.  But it's really good marinated with soy sauce and sesame oil.

8490 2018-03-22 04:07:48 I know this sounds crazy but coconut oil is great. all you have to do is put it in your hair especially your scalp & then let it stay for a few hours & then rinse it out. also if you don’t shampoo your hair everyday it will hydrate it.

8493 2018-03-22 04:07:06 Witch hazel and coconut oil
8494 2018-03-22 04:06:44 The NRA and the GOP view deaths from school shooting as collateral damage They care as much about the deaths of the kids in Parkland as much as they do ducks killed from an oil spill
8495 2018-03-22 04:06:35 Some evil idiot decided to spill oil on my cap & gown. And at this very moment I realized that the devil is testing me so I had to stay calm. Cause that’s all I can do

8497 2018-03-22 04:06:26 I couldn’t find coil atm I will look for more later. Just bought whatever they had which one some useless oil thing. I will go hunt for it thank you!!

8500 2018-03-22 04:05:24 #AMLiveNTV conflict of interest in stake, it is late than never , but our forest cover has been raped by " forest and wood merchants " who had used to oil those officials..
8501 2018-03-22 04:05:18 Growing up my mother used cleaning products with tea tree oil in it. Our whole house would smell like it. I just used some on my scalp and it smells like home.
8502 2018-03-22 04:05:09 /rlt/ yg pake bio oil ada yg purging dulu ga? Atau ga ada purgingnya?
8503 2018-03-22 04:05:01 Hear me out. Bacon, banana, and finely chopped chilli.

My local weird place makes this pizza and I’ve never eaten its equal.

I think it’s on an olive oil or white sauce base.
8504 2018-03-22 04:04:52 Forcing oil to be bought in dollars props up the dollar(the oil is eventually used up so its mainly a one way street). The bigger thing is we don't owe the national debt..Kennedy started printing bills without the FED..you can find them on ebay..1's 2's 5's. Executive order 11110
8505 2018-03-22 04:04:51 I can't have fish oil (can't eat most fish) gives me kidney stones. I love broiled halibut, swordfish and mako.
8506 2018-03-22 04:04:36 I am speaking of many Americans, least on foodstamps, least unemployed. Companies in oil and gas can't find enough workers! Wages go up to retain. No longer fines for no health insurance. Coal is being exported, first time in many yrs!! Much more happiness!! Do your research!!
8507 2018-03-22 04:04:20 It's so, so beautiful tonight. Totally worth the drift-kicking slog out even if you're not going to drink black oil and make eyes at the suddenly visible flickering spirits in the transmission towers.

8509 2018-03-22 04:03:56 Can I get an extended pony tail? Hold the olive oil.
8510 2018-03-22 04:03:53 I’ve covered myself in vaporub, I’ve got eucalyptus oil in my humidifier, I’ve been sucking on halls/ricola and drinking hot tea for days... someone give me a spell to say cause I’ve done everything short of witchcraft to get rid of this awful cough
8511 2018-03-22 04:03:25 AGREE, then kick Trump out of office..he just wiped out the EPA w/ a strike of his pen on an Executive Order, plus selected Rick Perry as his Energy Sec.. Rick hates EPA, is an Oil Tycoon, owns Oil Pipelines. We are going back to the 50s on Clean Air& Water.

But I don't have anything to wrap it with at the moment.

8526 2018-03-22 04:01:24 Surprise? To Who? #Oil
8527 2018-03-22 04:01:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and powerful politicians.
8528 2018-03-22 04:01:06 Ok well I have like combination skin so only my T-zone gets really oily so I can’t use it every day or it makes me face super dry so I use it like twice at the beginning and end of the week but it just depends how oil your skin is
8529 2018-03-22 04:00:59 Coconut oil and chill?  xD
8530 2018-03-22 04:00:47 Yes we all know you sold Native American land and public parks to the oil companies to mine and build unsafe pipelines that burst. We also know you used tax money to pimp out your office. We know you approve of lead in the water supply.
8531 2018-03-22 04:00:46 All newly employed off foodstamps and unemployment.. the Americans that aren't fined for not having insurance. The oil/gas companies that need so many workers they can't find enough, in turn the companies keep giving raises so no one leaves! ICE BUST M13 GANGS. NEED I GO ON?
8532 2018-03-22 04:00:41 Who's the saboteur?

@bcliberals and @SuzanneAnton took millions from oil, gas and coal companies & sabotaged democracy for over a decade. They obscured their donor list, and catered to industry at the expense of the public.
8533 2018-03-22 04:00:29 Let me guess. The Power, Control of Florida United States of Arab Control Over The Oil, which Trump pledged to ATTACK! Watch your backs.
8534 2018-03-22 04:00:27 Daniel, Google and do some research on black seed oil for skin.  It worked miracles for my skin.
8535 2018-03-22 04:00:20 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
8536 2018-03-22 04:00:13 Featured Entree - Lamb Chops - Four Succulent lamb chops marinated with crushed garlic, olive oil, spices and a touch of chili paste.
8537 2018-03-22 04:00:13 Urethane man. It comes from oil.

8540 2018-03-22 04:00:01 Yooo baking soda and coconut oil will clear that face right up!
8541 2018-03-22 03:59:55 Don't wonder I will calculate for u It's 2 Rs per day (1 Rs for hair oil +1Rs for shampoo)=2×365(no of days in year) ×42(Ur age)=30660 Rs approx (may very depending on rates)
8542 2018-03-22 03:59:43 그럼 제스가 못먹게 하겠지!
8543 2018-03-22 03:59:26 Yes braiding does wonders! Also if you put coconut oil in the roots of your hair before you braid it, that helps a lot! It’s great moisture and your hair definitely will be softer
8544 2018-03-22 03:59:20 Think about what type of privilege you gotta be in to make MEMEs about oil wars that are currently happening and killing innocent people because of your country’s trashness.
8545 2018-03-22 03:59:13 Have seen some big feuds on here over this.
Prevailing thought is this will shift global power to the East.
I follow some oil traders too, the wisest of which insists this will fail, big league.

Time will tell who Is right.
The threat is worth paying attention to though.
8546 2018-03-22 03:59:10 Lavender oil is my savior
8547 2018-03-22 03:58:59 @DonLemon_CNN The only reason #Trump's cronies agreed to work with him to drain the swamp is he told them there was oil at the bottom. Show me the TAX MONEY!
8548 2018-03-22 03:58:47 The smoke is in the hell would a recipe call for putting oil in a pan to cook sausages
8549 2018-03-22 03:58:45 You’re skin is oily because it’s over producing oil so as backwards as it sounds you need to incorporate more oil into your moisturizing routine and I LOVE the Kat Von D foundation. She has a lot of colors and I’m not oily after 5 minutes
8550 2018-03-22 03:58:38 わたしの夢のひとつに自作絵て、50ふぁぼ↑もらう事なんですけどセイバーリリィちゃんの絵が今ありがたいことに46ふぁぼも貰えてるんですよね

8551 2018-03-22 03:58:32 castor oil it is
8552 2018-03-22 03:58:25 Try cannabis oil. It will give you a appetite and help you along.. Trust me my mum has had 3 different cancers in 4 years.. This last one we choose cannabis oil it helped her so much.. Positive vibes girl
8553 2018-03-22 03:58:24 And if she took my comments as racist, then that's on her. Projection seems all the rage this year. May be she needs to reflect how she see the world.
8554 2018-03-22 03:58:09 i swear the first time i used mandarin oil in my humidifier i was hooked and 1 month later just thinking of the smell make me wanna puke
8555 2018-03-22 03:58:06 olive oil is really good with chicken and garlic. my secret pizza is peanut sauce and pepperoni.
8556 2018-03-22 03:58:02 제스한테 이를거야
8557 2018-03-22 03:57:50 What do u plan to do about the toxic air pollution that is emitted by oil re-refineries, APES/ELR and ORRCO on the Columbia. They have escaped federal and new state regulation, do not have good emission controls, & emit dangerous toxics. Is there foreign money invested in them?
8558 2018-03-22 03:57:50 ชอบ ใช่เลย
8559 2018-03-22 03:57:38 Time to make US #Congress sing 'The Beds Are Burning'  by Midnight Oil in response to their shameful, ignorant, self loathing hatred.... of us voters... IF U IMPEACH WE MARCH... #WETHEPPL some 70 million strong  and can't go wrong.. AND WE WILL DEMAND MCCONNELLS REMOVAL
8560 2018-03-22 03:57:35 Bloody $ASN  .. with OIL in the Brine .. was a SHOCKER !
perhaps the Clean #Lithium Brine can still be Found.. nearby 
if So.. $ASN will pop over 10c.. again
8561 2018-03-22 03:57:29 I saw a conversation on here once about how someone said that coconut oil was breaking their skin out. Perhaps it’s not the coconut oil. Maybe it’s the other 1,000+ chemicals you’re putting into your body everyday  just saying..
8562 2018-03-22 03:57:27 Beda lah. Bio oil lebih ke buat bekas luka. Haple itu face oil.
8563 2018-03-22 03:57:24 You sir,are the lowest snake oil salesmen in DC.We sent @realDonaldTrump to clean you thugs out.Where’s our wall?Where’s our border protection?Where’s our voter id’s for citizens only?You put a gun to the head of American’s to accept your gravy train,or you will punish military.
8564 2018-03-22 03:56:46 What US Prez hasn't coddled the Saudis? Where is the Bush family in this discussion? "O-I-L". But now the Saudis see the future when THEIR oil isn't needed and the price of sand ain't all that.
8565 2018-03-22 03:56:42 はい！
ありがとうございます！！！
8566 2018-03-22 03:56:38 I'm burning the midnight oil at work peeps so I'm gonna start tweeting nonsense in 3...2...1
8567 2018-03-22 03:56:33 Gotta free those poor enslaved people! Then take the oil.
8568 2018-03-22 03:56:13 Someone explain to me how building a wall, promoting coal, off shore oil drilling, eliminating arts and humanities endowments.i could go on.I’m open. Please, I’m struggling to see the plan unfolding to our benefit. I’m tired of the old ways. I know we got more advanced shit!

8577 2018-03-22 03:55:02 Not sure why your money problems are my fault, but I digress.

My original point still stands. You can, if you wish, move your kids and your dog down to Texas and get a job in oil there, since you think Trudeau and Muslims are somehow ruining your life.
8578 2018-03-22 03:54:56 나중에 더 고생하지말고 잘 챙겨드세요
8579 2018-03-22 03:54:53 @charlesadler  Is Canada's oil industry being Trumped?

8582 2018-03-22 03:54:47 Wow. I truly feel sad for you. When are you gonna wake up and realize it was all snake oil?  And you bought it? And are still buying it? Astonishing
8583 2018-03-22 03:54:41 I don't know where you are but in New Zealand we need oil and lots of it.
8584 2018-03-22 03:54:39 So happy I met my suite mate! she left me a teddy and a sweet note to cheer me up bc I had a hard weekend & now she knows my sinuses are acting up and she let me use her essential oil diffuser. So I can sleep through the night. I am blessed!
8585 2018-03-22 03:54:38 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
8586 2018-03-22 03:54:31 Sis coconut oil wont do anything for it lmaoo. Ice it 15-20min while elevated and put on a brace or a sleeve for some compression.

8590 2018-03-22 03:54:17 Indian government bonds are likely to edge lower after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected. Gains in crude oil prices are also likely to weigh on demand for Indian debt, traders said.
8591 2018-03-22 03:53:46 It moisturizes ur hair w good oil just like lotion does for ur skin,,
8592 2018-03-22 03:53:40 You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
8593 2018-03-22 03:53:30 The narrative has already started: he was a nice kid, smart, mental issues. If he was brown skinned it would be a  different story. We both know that. For us to think otherwise is a mistake.
8594 2018-03-22 03:53:24 "The secret of happiness is to see all the Marvels of the world and never forget the drops of oil on the spoon". 
So, to decipher this, I would say appreciate all of the things others have created, but treasure and safeguard what little you have.
8595 2018-03-22 03:53:06 Yup. Amazon I think is where we get ours. You can find some flavors at Central Market, Whole Foods, Sprouts. Coconut oil, Kerry Gold unsalted butter, splash of heavy whipping cream, some English toffee & coffee & and immersion blender.
8596 2018-03-22 03:52:44 this has happened to me during vajrasana and then I remembered I worked in coconut oil to keep skin friction to a minimum
8597 2018-03-22 03:52:43 @REALDonaldTrump @POTUS We need to realize we cannot continue much longer on a path to self-destruction. Filthy oil and the products made from it poisoning our children, most kids on at least one pharma product before 5yo, to the point of them being insane and killing each other.
8598 2018-03-22 03:52:34 Oiaaa gw berapa kali pengen nyobain itu juga tp gajadi2 eh kebeli coconut oil wkwkkw multifungsi kalo gw laper gw jadiin sele aja ya kan 
8599 2018-03-22 03:52:25 The WH spent weeks trying to negotiate a heated dispute between the corn & oil industries, both key constituencies for Trump, over the future of biofuel. 

In the end, Trump, in exasperation says, y'all just work it out.

If it's not campaign fodder, it's #notmyjob!  
8600 2018-03-22 03:51:57 $200 for a damn oil change... you got me fucked up. 
8601 2018-03-22 03:51:55 옆에서 샐러드나 드세요
8602 2018-03-22 03:51:54 Given how fucking expensive Sunday Riley's Luna Oil is, you'd think they could at least throw in some fragrance to not make it smell like medicinal herbs steeped in old socks
8603 2018-03-22 03:51:49 Took the car for safety inspection. It failed. To pass, it needs a bulb replaced, engine washed (no visible oil), new rear tires, working windshield washer, and... a sticker which shows the gear shift pattern. Otherwise it is UNSAFE!!!
8604 2018-03-22 03:51:27 America is in a hurry, there is oil at the bottom of the stairs.

8606 2018-03-22 03:51:23 it is mind blowing to me that there are people out there who enjoy the smell of tea tree oil 
8607 2018-03-22 03:51:21 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
8608 2018-03-22 03:51:21 Socialism works, the reason Venezuela failed was oil and U.S imperialism, Venezula was too dependent on oil,which is why we need to work on worldwide clean energy, we can get to 100% renewable energy. We also need to stop invading other counties with our imperialism 1/
8609 2018-03-22 03:51:16 This so called government is so embarrassing what with that awful Shane Jones going on and on  and angry JAGenter wanting oil and gas exploration halted.  Do any of them know what the others are saying, not say doing because nothing is getting done without a working group
8610 2018-03-22 03:51:07 I'm sure tramadol was one I couldn't have because of other meds I'm on. I'm interested to try cbd oil though but don't really understand how you know what dose etc
8611 2018-03-22 03:50:55 Alex buys a drink I asked what is was and she goes “Malibu and pineapple...it tastes like tanning oil basically.” Lol wtf
8612 2018-03-22 03:50:45 When life seems to go sideways, thankful for friends that stand upright with listening ears & encouraging mouths. "Oil & perfume make the heart glad & the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel." (Prov. 27:9)

8617 2018-03-22 03:50:08 free energy and the cancer cure

the weed oil is the best cure or most effective i think
avacadoes is another..i can't remember right now
there are natural things that help as well

chemo is not your best chance

8625 2018-03-22 03:49:25 But this is what I mean about hypocrisy: if he, the bomber, was brown, she wouldn't have said "his mother would be heartbroken". That's what I called out. As a wht man I feel we should call it out. We expect Muslims to call out terror attacks so should also do it.

8769 2018-03-22 03:31:01 Yeah... & Fuq water, let's build oil carrying pipelines and rigs near our water... who needs that stuff, huh?
8770 2018-03-22 03:30:54 mineral oil is no joke man, my ears feel great

I am excited for your vacuum

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
8773 2018-03-22 03:30:30 Not clear. they said the buyer has 60 days to empty the pipeline. It seems they have to make holes in it to drain it. 
On the other hand, there is an oil tanker full of Yemeni oil that has been stranded for 3 years and started leaking. @TankerTrackers
8774 2018-03-22 03:30:27 Bliss works so good for my skin right now, cause my skin is usually oily but lately I’ve been dry. I will say though that the moisturizer can make my skin oily so sometimes I skip out on it and just use the serum. I need to try coconut oil, do you use it at night? Or daily too?
8775 2018-03-22 03:30:17 (We’re eating wonton noodles with scallion oil, chicken and veggies, which I made.)

Husband: “How much did a packet of these noodles cost?”

Me: “About $2?”

8yo: “I TOLD you love is cheap! Because I LOVE these noodles.”

8778 2018-03-22 03:29:53 American oil memes are a saving grace on the internet.

8780 2018-03-22 03:28:59 And whatever the UK's and Europe's population, if Russia cut off the oil, they'd be in a world of hurt.
8781 2018-03-22 03:28:43 i only tried oil pulling a few times but my teeth are so much brighter already
8782 2018-03-22 03:28:40 I'm wasting my time obviously if that's where you are going here. You've assumed one idiotic thing after another with this thread.
8783 2018-03-22 03:28:37 My mom has told me abt bliss!!! She hella likes it she said it’s good if u have dry skin. U should try coconut oil it makes my skin hella soft but u gotta apply a super light layer
8784 2018-03-22 03:28:23 I need more black castor oil
8785 2018-03-22 03:28:07 Olive oil!  
8786 2018-03-22 03:28:07 Box sooo slippery its like trynna walk on oil 
8787 2018-03-22 03:28:04 I was in walmart earlier picking out led lights and shit to go in my room when i was just supposed to be getting an oil change
8788 2018-03-22 03:27:59 Ha! I will never forget the look on your face when you saw my awesome ride. You wouldn't set foot in it.  It really did catch fire a little bc I never checked the oil: did NOT rise from the flames.
8789 2018-03-22 03:27:33 It’s from the bruins version of oil change called behind the b. It’s actually pretty well done and you can find the first couple seasons on YouTube. Most of the eps anyway. I liked it. Wouldn’t mind seeing shows of other teams tbh. It’s a cool concept.
8790 2018-03-22 03:27:26 The best part is using the oil from the giardiniera bottle to toss with sliced brussel sprouts then roasted in oven. @IamBenFeldheim showed me that trick and I SHAN’T forget it.
8791 2018-03-22 03:27:18 Bro the vinegar and olive oil part had me dying 
8792 2018-03-22 03:27:11 The TLC night serum 100% then the protini moisturizer. For extra cleansing the baby facial mask is a must have every couple weeks. And then, facial oil and day serum. It’s just allll so good.

8794 2018-03-22 03:26:44 pasta with olive oil, garlic and anchovies is slowly becoming my favorite thing to eat at home
8795 2018-03-22 03:26:31 botanical or rum oil terpenes?
8796 2018-03-22 03:26:27 Ask George Bush.  His family's got a ton of oil money.
8797 2018-03-22 03:26:22 One well off the coast of Alaska has enough oil to supply the U.S. for 100 years not to mention Zapada 60 miles off the coast of Florida that also sustain us for over 100 years and hundreds that are capped off all over the country.
8798 2018-03-22 03:26:19 SHIT AINT WORKING. COCONUT OIL IS NEXT
8799 2018-03-22 03:26:00 #AnimalesSueltos es la plata de las estaciones de servicios privadas que hacíamos pre pago de las naftas y el gas oil para recibir producto.

8801 2018-03-22 03:25:36 Rip to my oil pan every day that I go up my death trap driveway
8802 2018-03-22 03:25:18 Um I’ve recently started using vitamin E oil cream and it seems to help. But also steaming your face
8803 2018-03-22 03:25:17 Exactly why fracking and big oil must be stopped
8804 2018-03-22 03:25:13 Russia has a much stronger record. 21 states have now discovered Russian malware in there voting systems. Russian freighter delivered oil to North Korea after un sanctions. Russia's been playing this game a lot longer and is much more sophisticated
8805 2018-03-22 03:24:59 Hyouka 11.5- Oreki’s sister is a bad person for giving him SPF 50 sunscreen
When I lifeguarded, I never used more than 25, and really only used SPF 15 (or 2 SPF Tanning Oil). If your gonna be in the sun and you are young, get an awesome tan out of it!
8806 2018-03-22 03:24:37 No! Oil is a fossil fuel & kills the environment. Write again about ur investment in CLEAN energy & I’ll happily read that. Thanks.
8807 2018-03-22 03:24:16 I was going to try to extract the oil from the seeds using a hydraulic press.
8808 2018-03-22 03:24:15 Bangladesh me to menga nikla oil ap kya kroge bhai
8809 2018-03-22 03:24:13 # Ghodbandar Road Traffic Jam Due to Oil Tanker break down
8810 2018-03-22 03:24:05 Another disgusting example of the War Trudeau and his left wing eco-terrorist government is waging on the Canadian Oil industry and all the industrial jobs across Canada that have left for US. Tax payers ask the hard questions of your members of parliament.
8811 2018-03-22 03:23:58 i lather a ridiculous amount of body oil when i get out of the shower. i smell like roses lavander and jasmine 
8812 2018-03-22 03:23:47 Dressed my temples in Lavender Oil
8813 2018-03-22 03:23:40 Bien por la decisión del juez Cosentino de intervenir el manejo de Oil Combustible y poner en resguardo los activos.
8814 2018-03-22 03:23:36 have you tried vitamin e oil?
8815 2018-03-22 03:23:01 Note to self: taking a bath w/ coconut oil makes the bottom of the tub very slippery 
8816 2018-03-22 03:23:01 @BySHSpencer 2) You spoke to experts about the impossibility of 'controlling the aquifer' but ignore the feasibility of simply tapping it, like the practice with other natural resources like oil and natural gas as you note Brazil has not signed intl Law of Transboundary Aquifers
8817 2018-03-22 03:22:49 No particular book to recommend. But before 9/11, various UN players (esp. France) were getting rich by illegally buying Iraqi oil on the collapsing oil-for-food program. There's no dispute about that. Containment was at an end. /1
8818 2018-03-22 03:22:43 WTI oil over $60. Sure be nice if we could get some of our oil to new customers and see some of that added prosperity for our province.
8819 2018-03-22 03:22:38 Coconut oil is so addicting. You can literally put it anywhere on your body. Just a little bit goes such a long way. And the benefits are literally amazing.
8820 2018-03-22 03:22:17 Muy bien x recordar la publicidad de Tinelli con Oil!!!
8821 2018-03-22 03:22:10 i desperately wish that i was the type of person who fully believed that a drop of tea tree oil in my water could legitimately heal jet lag/nausea/pms  but i simply cannot
8822 2018-03-22 03:22:06 I’m literally about to take this bottle and put some rose hips oil in it because I can’t do $30 for nothing that’s not groceries 
8823 2018-03-22 03:22:05 black....oil...
8824 2018-03-22 03:21:41 On this episode of An Allston Millennial, Camille starts crying because her essential oil diffuser won’t work

8826 2018-03-22 03:21:27 Never take your car to Walmart for fucking anything they put the wrong oil filter on my camaro now my engines shot
8827 2018-03-22 03:21:25 Sounds like Burt’s bees! Maybe I will give this I try. I’ve tried just coconut oil and some essential oils and it felt like something was missing.
8828 2018-03-22 03:21:19 お疲れ様なのです
8829 2018-03-22 03:21:06 Yeah well, because of the GOP they're broke. FYI: Talk to the oil companies and that 3/4 vote they need to raise taxes.
8830 2018-03-22 03:21:02 I AM CACKLING LMAO we can ask Not on twitter Graig for who he went to for the oil painting
8831 2018-03-22 03:20:58 Exacto....Techint y Hunt Oil...también viene....
8832 2018-03-22 03:20:19 Real news here in Anderson SC. I held door open for a person of different skin color, they smiled & said thank u. I was getting gas, & young men of color came over & asked me if I needed help as I was putting oil in my daughters car. RACISM is being pushed by the left.
8833 2018-03-22 03:20:17 At Trump Tower, Paul Ryan patiently explains to Ben Carson that convicts are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Alex Jones quits drinking.
8834 2018-03-22 03:20:05 Until you walk your talk, I'll just assume you are a BS Snake Oil Salesman.   Example, until Al Gore gets rid of his mansions and stops flying around the world, how could you take him seriously on CO2.  Like a Dr. smoking, while he tells me to stop smoking - but Dr. buys offsets?
8835 2018-03-22 03:20:02 Try to get oil, natural gas and coal out of the scene and let me know how that’s going for you. Not going to happen.
8836 2018-03-22 03:19:57 Wow after a bad day moms had the hot oil jacuzzi bath ready when i walked in 
8837 2018-03-22 03:19:55 Adam: pencuci muka Atikah utk apa
Me: brightening & oil control
A: Oh! Ok la Adam pakai Atikah punya supaya muka berseri
M: Nak berseri kena minum air 3L also
A: OKAY DAH JGN MINUM AIR DALAM BILIK NI SEMUA ADAM PUNYA *minum air sambil belek muka kat cermin*
8838 2018-03-22 03:19:52 Sounds wonderful. The family love the Chinese cabbage, with toasted pine nuts. Shallots, fried noodles plus a dressing of white vinegar, caster sugar, Soy sauce, sesame oil, & olive oil. Boiled on stove. Chill & add. One of those Changs recipes. But yours sounds delish.
8839 2018-03-22 03:19:29 そちらも二桁とは…！お疲れ様でした！
8840 2018-03-22 03:18:44 ７月１０日はオイルの日。

8842 2018-03-22 03:18:38 いいよ、idおしえたら送っとくよ
8843 2018-03-22 03:18:20 General. You are a great example regarding the environment. Thanks for showing some leadership. It’s common sense. It’s as important as oil or other strategic resources.
8844 2018-03-22 03:18:14 As an Alaskan living in Houston I can confirm.

We have a nice selection of oil, meat, and racism here.
8845 2018-03-22 03:18:06 Why is it so hard to call white men who do terrorist act what they are: terrorist. If he was brown you would not say his mother must be heart broken, you would shake your head and say something about "those kinds of ppl". Hypocrisy.
8846 2018-03-22 03:17:52 Dont forget crude and yields :) #OIL is well for bears today :)
8847 2018-03-22 03:17:48 LINEで「おっぱいは売ってる」とかいう名言が流れてきて昼からビビってる

8853 2018-03-22 03:16:56 I have a very oily face so most of the products that says oil free are trash and they don’t work
8854 2018-03-22 03:16:44 Of course the scrub at work gets the nice hoist with the giant workbench to go with it. It’s not like I do bigger jobs than fucking oil changes.
8855 2018-03-22 03:16:40 So, "Mexico will pay for the wall"?

More proof you are NO dealmaker. You are a snake oil salesmen, telling the poor sick people what they want to hear, while you pocket their hard earned money.

If you had a conscience, you'd feel guilty. If you had a soul, it would go to Hell.
8856 2018-03-22 03:16:35 Chef Gusteau cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with toast.
8857 2018-03-22 03:16:27 I loved the Ted talk presented by David McCandless it really showed me that data visualization is really changing the way the world works. Data really is the new oil #IT105_SP18
8858 2018-03-22 03:16:25 Don't forget the fourth Cock-a-roach Paul "The oil will pay for the war" Wolfowitz.
8859 2018-03-22 03:16:23 おつおつ！
8860 2018-03-22 03:16:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.
8861 2018-03-22 03:15:52 I've said It , the American Ambassador and Aid were Murdered by Hillary and her colleagues! To throw America into War! Requires a horrific Act of War! A Slaughterhouse of 20 or More? STAND DOWN! 32 Young Innocent Americans MUST DIE ! Hillary Knew it! To declare War over New Oil !
8862 2018-03-22 03:15:36 Windmills and solar panels are decimating bird species. Many which are endangered. Am pretty sure more wildlife has died due to what government calls green energy than wildlife lost due to oil spills. (Not saying one is better. All 3 are bad)

8864 2018-03-22 03:15:35 I wanna get my grandma some hair but I don’t have time for her putting baby oil on some bundles in Liberia
8865 2018-03-22 03:15:24 ok i need waterproof mascara and eyeliner bc my eyes water so badly when i wear contacts but the problem is I DON’T HAVE ANY BABY OIL TO GET IT OFF
8866 2018-03-22 03:15:18 And  another thing: as a white man, I feel it so my responsibility to call out white hypocrisy. Maybe if you would have said you feel for the black mother, which you obviously don't,  of the black kid who was MURDERED, I would have not felt the need to call you out.

8871 2018-03-22 03:14:04 on world poetry day I tried to bake a bread without eggs or butter or oil & only a tiny bit of sugar & also cream cheese (???) & it was a lot like writing a poem because I still have no idea what I’m doing, in life or on the page
8872 2018-03-22 03:13:53 Because they don't want the public to know the truth, there is no winner with a war with Russia just fallout, you mentioned Iraq where saddam  threatened Bush Sr with oil so they made up the WMD hoax to start a war, no one wants to start a war with Russia trust me on that.
8873 2018-03-22 03:13:47 The government of South Sudan need to be caution about USA interfering with their affairs.This nation run always after rich nation.They love to robbed people with their resources.Our nation is in their radars. Oil is the main target for them.
8874 2018-03-22 03:13:30 The dust sticks to the oil from your hands when someone touches your car
8875 2018-03-22 03:13:27 Not sure. Carter did mention expanding solar, but spent more time talking up having the most domestic coal and oil ever. Not sure when this fossil fuel addiction started, but Carter didn't help.
8876 2018-03-22 03:13:27 The everyday Americans who know that you are a "fast talking" "snake oil" peddling "used car" "sales man" who has to be voted out of office soon.

8879 2018-03-22 03:13:09 The US will only attack places like Iraq and Lybia( when Gaddafi wanted to trade his oil with the Gold dinar) they cannot and wont wage a conventional war against a formidable opponent like Russia and China. They would Lose.

8884 2018-03-22 03:12:46 Coconut oil on it is much better. Soak it, wash it out in the morning and let it air dry if you can. I repeat that weekly. My hair falls out way less than it use to and it’s much softer and stronger.
8885 2018-03-22 03:12:38 Oil tanker toppled over
8886 2018-03-22 03:12:25 Most Dems voted in the wake of 9/11 fear, anger & misplaced patriotism.

Cheney was looking at Oil & Halliburton $.

Bush payback for Poppy.
8887 2018-03-22 03:12:16 taking enough weed oil to knock a beluga out in hopes of getting a full night’s sleep oh ya bby
8888 2018-03-22 03:12:06 our Prez signed executive order allowing Dow Chemical to  use world-wide banned pesticide because $2 mil campaign donation, allows coal cos dump into water, eliminates oil cos from paying cleanup ( rescinded $9 barrel towards cleanup) we are not being environmentally responsible
8889 2018-03-22 03:11:51 That was my next question, does baby oil mean.. no..no God please noooo! 
8890 2018-03-22 03:11:43 We pay around $1.30 for every dollar we get back. Texas is the only red state I know that gives more than it gets back , and that only cuz oil n gas

8892 2018-03-22 03:11:16 how do you like the peppermint oil?
8893 2018-03-22 03:11:02 I’ve used acv and it hasn’t done too much. do you know where you can get bio oil
8894 2018-03-22 03:10:59 Essential oils digestzen or another oil that really helps is Edens Garden Tummy Aid oil. I rub some on my wrists, and I always feel so much better!
8895 2018-03-22 03:10:54 my parents took CBD oil today for the first time and they kept asking me “can you tell? can you tell?” 
8896 2018-03-22 03:10:46 I’m massaging some peppermint and some growth oil in  sis same. Scalp just disrespectful. This dry weather needs to be gone
8897 2018-03-22 03:10:38 Oil or acrylic? Fantastic art!
8898 2018-03-22 03:10:35 26 March China will dump $US for oil payment in their own Petro Crypto Currency. USA wont be able to bomb them like they do with other countries.

8904 2018-03-22 03:10:17 T2 Sorry to be a day late. But researchers must set their biases aside for this. It is my opinion that the #OpioidEpidemic is due in part to the absence of research in alternative medicine pain modalities, i.e. chiropractic, acupuncture, acupressure, healing hands, CBD oil.
8905 2018-03-22 03:10:04 India has an Oil import bill of ~$100bn. Going solar-electric will not only benefit environment but also channelise that money into productive use. More money needs to be pumped in for innnovation

8916 2018-03-22 03:08:00 Oil hits six-week high on inventory data, Mideast worries #Market
8917 2018-03-22 03:07:40 Some article @Oil_Guns_Merica tweeted earlier about binary blah blah gender blah blah.
8918 2018-03-22 03:07:35 26 March China will dump $US for oil payment in their own Petro Crypto Currency. USA wont be able to bomb them like they do with other countries. President wont be able to sign executive order to stop ppl from using Chinese petro currency. Now you know why date is in Report 23
8919 2018-03-22 03:07:25 I think they should wrestle in oil.
8920 2018-03-22 03:07:25 Oregano oil and apple cidar vinegar (dilutes with water)
8921 2018-03-22 03:07:12 * OUR oil !  
8922 2018-03-22 03:07:09 Wasn’t this a Trump campaign promise. To just go in and take their oil?  (Not that it’s a proper thing to do, nor do I agree.) I’m just pointing out, Trump promised to take their oil.
8923 2018-03-22 03:06:44 i used hella coconut oil in my hair and WOW 
8924 2018-03-22 03:06:21 @AEPnews The Glanon Filter-Cart is a preventive maintenance tool used to filter/reclaim the lube oil of a boiler feed pump in a power plant.

8927 2018-03-22 03:06:08 The rise of the oil price is stunning these days.
8928 2018-03-22 03:06:04 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.
8929 2018-03-22 03:06:01 look man oil prices are good money to get me on this website ok
8930 2018-03-22 03:06:00 In a way it’s a little like “Oil Change” was but to show the behind the scenes on the Seguin Trade is certainly eye opening.

I thought Bradley was the more interesting and he got promoted to assistant GM after
8931 2018-03-22 03:05:49 Is it not obvious to all OG's that these certain BTC whales got together to create more free money for themselves, so they created a fork of BTC, but nobody is buying it? so VER and others TRICK/SCAM new people into buying there literal snake oil. ???
8932 2018-03-22 03:05:44 Nope , miners want the most cost effective efficient energy possible to maximize profits.... energy sources like hydro, solar, geothermal and atomic are far cheaper than the more pollution sources like coal or oil.
8933 2018-03-22 03:05:29 I have lucked out, All I do is vitamins and fish oil pills.

8935 2018-03-22 03:05:20 I’m ok. I have home care and the cannabis oil manages the pain kind of. I’m still figuring out strains. I have a PT and RN and LCSW seeing me at home.
8936 2018-03-22 03:05:00 “I’m not losing any sleep over peak oil demand or stranded resources,” Saudi Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser
8937 2018-03-22 03:04:55 @SuzanneAnton your assertion that foreign agents are pivotal in the tanker debate mirrors the previous Tory government. I’m sure Canadian protesters ate their own masters. We have to change our low refining capacity and charge proper royalty rates to the oil corps working here
8938 2018-03-22 03:04:50 Also, Tommy Robinson walks around beating up black people on the street, Sargon publically strategizes with white nationalists, and PJW, well, aside from selling snake oil I don't think he leaves his room so he's fine, if a bit pathetic.

8942 2018-03-22 03:04:31 Evening Primrose oil would probably be worth a shot then. It hydrated your face really well and tightens pores up so much
8943 2018-03-22 03:04:29 Hannity.  Dirty snake oil salesman.
8944 2018-03-22 03:04:28 Senior sales rep at econo heat inc. We have the largest selection of this type of equipment in the world. If your school has a heating system and your garage has access to used oil from the buses I'm your guy!!!!!

8950 2018-03-22 03:03:45 The environment is not political. Every major political party on EARTH recognizes climate change, except GOP.  Are you saying Sudan, Iran, Russia, N Korea are buying into a liberal conspiracy? GOP ignores science because they are beholden to the oil industry. What’s your excuse?
8951 2018-03-22 03:03:45 Got castor oil in my eye and now I think i’m Helen Keller
8952 2018-03-22 03:03:22 Pruit still thinks he's working for the oil industry
8953 2018-03-22 03:03:10 “The oil of grace was not mingled with their endeavors.Their religion was a dry husk without the true kernel.”
8954 2018-03-22 03:02:48 I hope they break him up like Standard Oil or Ma Bell.
8955 2018-03-22 03:02:38 In 1991, the Gulf War Oil spill was one of the largest oil spill in history. An estimated 1.5 million tonnes of crude oil spilled in the Persian Golf. #disaster #WaterPollution #Lesson10

8957 2018-03-22 03:02:13 the only thing I've found that works is CBD oil
8958 2018-03-22 03:02:06 Some herbalists claim burdock root oil can help with that. It definitely helps scalp health either way. Something to look into.
8959 2018-03-22 03:02:05 Tea tree oil! Works wonders boo
8960 2018-03-22 03:02:01 Fellas, don't do push-ups on a wooden floor after putting beard oil on unless, you want your beard the touch the wooden floor
8961 2018-03-22 03:01:59 Maybe if I just drink coconut oil this feeling will go away
8962 2018-03-22 03:01:51 Really out here with olive oil treatment in my hair tryna run errands before everything closes 
8963 2018-03-22 03:01:50 additional problem for our markets now is further escalation of brent crude. today brent is almost at 70$/bbl.we are already sitting with a fat import bill. India’s crude oil import bill up 28% to $8.1 bln in Feb. now import bill up 25% to $80 bln in 11 months bet April-Feb FY18
8964 2018-03-22 03:01:49 ไอคลเหี้ยย
8965 2018-03-22 03:01:46 Yeah and Massachusetts has the best whalers for oil in the 1840s. No one care you’re extinct
8966 2018-03-22 03:01:37 Just wondering, is your campaign funded by oil companies too? The ones using eminent domain on personal property for foreign gain.
8967 2018-03-22 03:01:29 Must be the coconut oil
8968 2018-03-22 03:01:28 ก็ต้องลองซื้อไปชิมแหละนะ555555
8969 2018-03-22 03:01:20 I hope that's a joke. I live in Oklahoma, it's a RED state. Our governor is about as Republican as it gets and even though the economy in OK was the best even during the recession, she has sold us out to big oil.
8970 2018-03-22 03:01:18 I wonder how much money I’ve saved till now on hair oil and shampoo...

8980 2018-03-22 02:59:25 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.  #ALDUB140thWeeksary
8981 2018-03-22 02:59:24 why is it when i try to fix my dry skin to gets too oily but when i control the oil my face becomes the Sahara desert
8982 2018-03-22 02:59:02 As well as Oil and Power Coys anything that has a monopoly

8986 2018-03-22 02:57:46 I guess Americans found some oil in him.
8987 2018-03-22 02:57:00 Waste oil of some kind they said. It's going to be fertilizer soon if you know what I mean.
8988 2018-03-22 02:56:55 Back on my heating pad/oil bullshit.
8989 2018-03-22 02:56:54 IT’S ONLY MY SECOND TIME WITH OIL
8990 2018-03-22 02:56:49 Suing oil companies is better politically than suing every person who has ever bought a gallon of gasoline...
8991 2018-03-22 02:56:24 “The oil of grace gives to men the courage, and supplies to them the motives, for doing every day the work that God appoints to them.”
8992 2018-03-22 02:56:18 Triste que el meme de Estados Unidos invadiendo por el oil solo puede darse en inglés.
Sino diría que mi carita está tan grasosa que está que le cae Estados Unidos rn
8993 2018-03-22 02:56:11 I forgot to smuggle some oil home. I'm the worst when it comes to remembering non work related things.

That might be a problem.
8994 2018-03-22 02:55:38 Did the Oilers get to talk w Marody prior to the trade to get a sense for whether he would sign w the Oil after college?
8995 2018-03-22 02:55:29 I went through a heavy sugar eating phase and now that I changed what I ate it helped so much  Yours will get there!! Evening primrose oil capsules work magic for my skin
8996 2018-03-22 02:55:26 Bby u pkai tak oil cleanser ke apa tah org pnggil yg org buat double cleanser tu..

8998 2018-03-22 02:55:04 their oil is running dry.
8999 2018-03-22 02:55:00 My new lotion is the best thing ever. I just rubbed myself down with natural peppermint oil and feel like a new person. Why have I not been using lotions with essential oils!!!?!?
9000 2018-03-22 02:54:48 I'll give it a try! I've been using 100% pure tea tree oil
9001 2018-03-22 02:54:20 Sinus infection means that all lights off (even unplugged the bedside clock), lavender essential oil diffuser, NyQuil and listening to sleep hypnosis on Apple Music. hoping to not wake up 500 times through the night coughing.
9002 2018-03-22 02:53:51 Trump is the FAKE republican. He donated to Hillary and Schumer. You got conned by a NY oil snake salesman.
9003 2018-03-22 02:53:29 say what you will about essential oils but I had a headache that Advil didn’t touch and 15 minutes after using peppermint oil it’s almost gone
9004 2018-03-22 02:53:18 Walked into my moms house and got smacked with holy oil
9005 2018-03-22 02:53:10 Teresa May not pushing Brexit,  do the math....1plus 68 is 69.,,,there is oil under middle eastern deserts, why? Hmmmm?! Maybe Climate change!...buy a vowel and getta fucking clue Wink!

9007 2018-03-22 02:52:43 If it’s a keloid try tea tree oil if you haven’t already!
9008 2018-03-22 02:52:35 #OOTT I have been asked many times why I don't short the crude market, simple answer is I drill and produce Oil wells........
9009 2018-03-22 02:52:34 Once again it's illegal to be aided by a foreign government in a federal election.Cambridge Analytica recieves funds from Russian oil company with a Kremlin connection.
9010 2018-03-22 02:52:25 Girl. No. I need to get some. My friend said the same thing but I haven’t found a tea tree oil that you can put on your face. Like I’ve seen the tea tree essential oil but it says not to put directly on your skin
9011 2018-03-22 02:52:22 私が中学生だった頃、ストパーが流行り出して、くせ毛じゃない子達が次々とストパーをかけだしたんですけど、その頃は禁止ではなかったですねぇ。長さと縛り方は注意されてましたけど。そしてストパーに関しては先生ではなく先輩方が｢1年のくせにストパーとか生意気｣って厳しかったです(笑)

9016 2018-03-22 02:51:29 I’ve been a busy witch. I made Van Van: oil, spray, soap, and lotion. I also made fast luck oil and spray. And I’m making more things tonight. I must be feeling better :)
9017 2018-03-22 02:51:20 It's the same plane: so unless Pruitt is locked in with the pilots, he is accessible to any1 else in the plane.  

How about making the oil/energy lobby, whom he really works for, pay for his travels while he moonlights for the EPA?
9018 2018-03-22 02:50:55 I put tea tree oil on my face and then took out my contacts and my eyes won’t stop leaking 
9019 2018-03-22 02:50:48 Mint hookah remind me of eucalyptus oil
9020 2018-03-22 02:50:47 Okay then go to China and India and tell them when they get the air over those crap holes fixed the UN and everyone else can lecture the United States. Na I say drill oil all ya want I couldn't care less I just don't want to see crying over the Keystone pipeline anymore.

9024 2018-03-22 02:50:13 I don’t get that at all, I’ve been fixing Subaru’s for almost 15 years, fully certified ASE master technician and a senior master certified Subaru tech and am thrilled to explain to my customers why they should get their oil changed when they should!!!
9025 2018-03-22 02:50:11 People either do not vote enough or vote for the same crooks that got us here. Why should they change what they do if people will re-elect them anyways while they continue to fill their pocket with oil money?
9026 2018-03-22 02:50:11 Pretty sure i just fried em in a skillet with oil til they were a little browned! Nothin fancy
9027 2018-03-22 02:50:02 Gazetted price for crude palm oil at 2,474.63 ringgit/ton, according to emailed Customs Dept. statement.
5% rate effective April 1-30: customs statement
Tax rate was at 6% in Dec.
9028 2018-03-22 02:49:52 I like to look at my old lady hobbies like oil painting and baking and imagine how good I’ll be when I’m retired and have nothing else to do but get better
9029 2018-03-22 02:49:30 So today I put so much oil in the brownie batter that they fried while they were baking so I guess don’t wife me up unless you’re willing to provide the necessary eggs
9030 2018-03-22 02:48:54 I was just going to suggest coconut oil, a miracle drug in a jar!
9031 2018-03-22 02:48:51 I really think it's a form of patriotism. The oil and gas industry has given many Albertans a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome. The oil and gas industry serves stockholders and executives, not Alberta and not the citizens of Alberta, but they've convinced a lot of people otherwise.
9032 2018-03-22 02:48:46 実は1月に発売になっておりました(*^-^)
9033 2018-03-22 02:48:30 @palmersworks  Has ANYONE in your company actually tried to get your coconut oil repairing conditioner out of its container???? It's too thick, even if you take the top off and shake it violently. Currently having to add water & stir with a chopstick. #utterUTTERfail
9034 2018-03-22 02:47:57 You didn't sear it hot enough. There's no encrusting that is supposed to form from the initial hit in the pan.

Try putting just coarse salt on it before you sear and get the oil in the IRON pan smoking hot, then only season with the other stuff after the steak is off the pan.
9035 2018-03-22 02:47:55 It will be interesting to see what happens to the USD once the Yuan Oil Futures start trading. The Petro is said to be backed by oil, whereas the USD is currently backed by being the currency that is used to trade oil. Once that goes we could see a gradual world wide USD sell off
9036 2018-03-22 02:47:51 En ninguna de las declaraciones juradas de CFK figuraron pagos a su abogado Beraldi, sin embargo en las de OIL (Cristobla López) aparecen muchicientos $$ a dicho abogado y también a Alberto Fernandez y a Martín Redrado
9037 2018-03-22 02:47:48 Magluluto ako ulit ng isda huhayss sana hinde ako matalsikan ng oil
9038 2018-03-22 02:47:26 hopefully oil dries up and you’d see difference and hindrance by the thing they call Nigeria. thieves.
9039 2018-03-22 02:46:58 buat aku milk/oil/balm cleanser tuh first cleanser, yg bener bener ngapus makeup, micellar itu 2nd cleanser cuma buat ngangkat sisa sebelum cuci muka.
9040 2018-03-22 02:46:58 These oil giant climate suits are so stupid. Does anyone really think people would have used less oil if these companies admitted climate change 30 years ago? And for what it’s worth, I bet the DA’s drive gas cars.
9041 2018-03-22 02:46:52 Is there any link between Lukoil and Rosneft, besides status as top Russian oil companies? Google isn’t being very helpful-just wondering if anyone knows more about this.
9042 2018-03-22 02:46:44 10/10 would recommend a brown sugar & coconut oil body scrub my skin is softer than a baby 
9043 2018-03-22 02:46:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
9044 2018-03-22 02:46:16 TY I CAN confirm that! :)

9058 2018-03-22 02:44:17 THESE OIL MEMES ARE KILLING ME
9059 2018-03-22 02:44:00 Natural gas is cheaper and has less of an environmental impact. China and India are closing coal plants for health and environmental reasons. You are like the guy trying to outlaw drilling for oil because Whale oil is an important part of the economy. You’ll inherit the wind fool
9060 2018-03-22 02:44:00 Have any of you guys tried vitamin e oil for acne scars

9072 2018-03-22 02:42:26 I don’t look like I have skin credibility so its gonna sound crazy but you gotta go with oils! They’re the closest thing to ur skin’s natural oils. Jojoba oil in specific- it’s super light weight/absorbs well
9073 2018-03-22 02:42:19 Let’s get BC on board now get the pipe line built so we can get our oil to foreign markets
9074 2018-03-22 02:42:04 You protested oil but yet you did this because of the government, so why not protest the government instead? One more #liar in government. #abpoli
9075 2018-03-22 02:41:58 It also benefits Liberals and NDP because they want to stifle jobs and growth in the oil and gas industry.

9084 2018-03-22 02:40:58 When I was in Croatia I bought a bottle of lavander oil that I used when I was there, I haven’t used it since I came back until today. As soon as I smelled it the nostalgia hit me like a fucking train, felt like I was back in Croatia in the sun. Now im sad.

9128 2018-03-22 02:33:16 CBD oil: doesn't get you high, smells like paint thinner, might not actually do anything. And yet I am so motivated to be able to bear weight with my left hand again that I'm really giving it a try. Who knows!

9131 2018-03-22 02:32:49 So the answer is train loads of oil through the mountains  instead of a safe closely monitored pipeline

9136 2018-03-22 02:31:44 I look forward to a peaceful protest with civil dialogue, that treats the ordinary men and women of the oil and gas sector with respect. And that does not interfere with the lawful rights of delegates to attend their conference and discuss big issues, including climate change.
9137 2018-03-22 02:31:33 The even more hilarious thing about this is that neoliberals want NAFTA and reject the wall BECAUSE of access to newly privatised oil reserves, among other things
9138 2018-03-22 02:31:27 Pretty close.  The shine is usually due to an oil slick though.

9152 2018-03-22 02:29:32 If you aren't worried yet about the latest oil companies sanctions in #SouthSudan by the United States, Google another country called Venezuela on a US radar. A country on top of the world in crude reserves but plummeting rapidly due to US sanctions.

9155 2018-03-22 02:29:25 What’s drove price in my area (northern OK) is oil and gas. All these older farmers got a huge payday 5 years ago and don’t know how else to spend it. Just last year we’ve been able to buy land at a more reasonable price.

9157 2018-03-22 02:29:16 I use creme of nature products they work miracles with the texture hair you have I’m pretty sure it’ll work on yours also. And i use warm oil every 3 days on my hair and i don’t use heat at all. But my great grandfather is Cuban and Mexican so that another reason. 
9158 2018-03-22 02:28:45 I’d rather hang myself by my nuts than cheer for either.  Having a “second” favourite team is BS, as is cheering for another when you’re out of it. When the Oil are done I watch baseball/football. #Oil4Life #OrangeBlood
9159 2018-03-22 02:28:11 Yours masters have talked (I mean lied) about changes for over 100 years. God willing, your oil runs out, you might have to actually create a real free market idea and product which your tyrants have suffocated.

9161 2018-03-22 02:28:03 You have no understanding or appreciation of the science involved in the FDA management of investigational therapies.

9163 2018-03-22 02:27:52 My current shower scents are ginger (shampoo), arugula (conditioner), and olive oil (body wash). In other words, I smell like a beautifully dressed salad.
9164 2018-03-22 02:27:44 This article claims Chavez nationalized oil. A quick Google search shows you that was actually done by Carlos Andres Perez in 1977. And that's not the most outrageous lie in this piece.

9177 2018-03-22 02:26:11 Russia is significantly more dependent on the west than either #DPRK or #Iran Do NO business w/#RUS.  Stop #NordStream.  No joint oil ventures.  Freeze assets.  Block travel.  Arm #UKR.
9178 2018-03-22 02:26:09 No, you are wrong. As a physician, I can promise you you are wrong, and all this will do is open the doors to any snake oil salesman who can fool dying people into paying lots of money for nothing. Leave Madison to the doctors.

9181 2018-03-22 02:25:41 Tonite the most productive thing I did was I made some pain creams (with coconut oil because it’s an anti inflammatory) and a couple rubs.
9182 2018-03-22 02:25:25 That competition exists, it has always existed. Pa is where the country was founded, we were the final destination of the underground railroad, we had the first oil well the first diamond mine and the first congress. We are the Keystone. We are the most balanced State.

9190 2018-03-22 02:23:21 Oh, that's so sweet that you would help out those children that are possibly orphans now or likely to have sibling born with deformities due to phosphorus in weapons used on them & after accepting their stolen oil & after those that stole it for you killed their relatives. 
9191 2018-03-22 02:23:12 Our oil is shrouded in mystery dealings. Last I heard was commercial sale of oil was to begin July 2017. 9 months on and there's no disclosure of whatever is going on.
9192 2018-03-22 02:23:10 He doesnt have oil reserves that can be pillaged, so of course Trump would say that.
9193 2018-03-22 02:22:23 I hate being sick because I'm the type to research "how to get over a cold in a day" and will end up eating 3 garlic cloves and 6 table spoons of coconut oil just because a soccer mom wrote a blog about home remedies that don't actually work

9196 2018-03-22 02:22:05 The oil is shiny,so it refracts the light. Water and oil together refracts more light.the rainbow colors, if you mixed them all together it would make white. The color of the sun.

9227 2018-03-22 02:18:13 What evolution is that? A realization that Alberta’s tax revenue comes from selling oil & gas? If she wants to keep her job, needs to get this done? Seriously this was how out of touch with reality these people were, had no idea bulk of tax dollars came from oil & gas industry
9228 2018-03-22 02:18:10 So, AI is unable to distinguish between an oil puddle and a human body in the night. Ugly conclusion but ask to AI to distinguish between some naked bodies and sand dunes, you'll see the results.

9236 2018-03-22 02:16:38 No you have it all wrong the constitution of independence says that America is the leader of the world, so whenever a country has oil, it’s our legally bound duty to get rid of their government creating a power vacuum, take all of it, and also massacre their civilians.

9325 2018-03-22 02:02:58 dear sir!  a student studying M Tech in SLIET located in a village in Punjab has been given the oil refinery examination center in Gauhati. Do you feel that this way of scrutiny is justified? After paying examination fee, if such situation is encountered, what one do?
9326 2018-03-22 02:02:54 Owhh . Yang tuu takleh buat apa laa . Sebab dieorg servis basic je kan . Minyak hitam minyak gearbox oil filter cas sampai harga cmtuu . Sama je macam perodua .
9327 2018-03-22 02:02:46 America's idea of slapping sanctions on most of the oil companies thought to be fueling war is a good thing, but sadly though, it won't make the war profiteers flinch.

Problem is that it's the same old style being repeated here that has never yielded any tangible results.

9330 2018-03-22 02:02:22 una buena iniciativa
9331 2018-03-22 02:02:20 monday: tried to pit an avocado with wet hands and stabbed myself in the palm. tuesday: washed dishes and held two knives by the blade, woke up with cuts all over my finger tips. today: put some onions on a pan and the oil fired back at me quicktime, got bumps on my arm now. welp
9332 2018-03-22 02:02:19 Do you do anything to care for the permissions? Oil or anything?
9333 2018-03-22 02:02:10 Pretty sure dumps reflexes aren’t as good as a good ole’ oil tycoon from Texas. I’ll bet he’d have a heel print in his orange forehead!

Arabia  depended on the generosity of Somalis & West Africans before oil. We love our Prophet but not the regimes.

9343 2018-03-22 02:01:25 We seem to be in “no man’s land,” but maybe saying that exposes my ignorance. What convinces you to short? I felt that rates were the biggest actual justification for a dip in Feb, but everything has subsided and dollar down/oil up/inflation not (yet) running wild..teach me :)
9344 2018-03-22 02:01:23  she wanted the money from the oil company not the man
9345 2018-03-22 02:01:17 levees.. y'all know this part.  gulf isn't really ocean. oil companies (and their canals) are evil. there are already ways around the lake.. hence the long bridge. coastal erosion. actually, this is the answer to most things. i know he was joking.
9346 2018-03-22 02:00:59 Yes, I already know this....  jk. But, start by making sure your scalp is moisturized. Find some good oils for your scalp. Jamaican black castor oil is a good one, so is almond oil! Try some leave in conditioners for your ends. And STOP STRAIGHTENING YOUR HAIR!
9347 2018-03-22 02:00:48 About to strip all the oil out of my hair and treat it .... and moisture it ... deep condition it .... #naturalhair ritual
9348 2018-03-22 02:00:41 Wrong. It's olive oil and celery salt and M&Ms.

9360 2018-03-22 01:59:56 That is not correct. The oil price never got close to his target low and he has missed every rally in crude since last year.

9366 2018-03-22 01:59:04 It doesn't work here in Florida, they had $20 oil changes for ladies on wednesdays, I went and said Im a lady today, but i paid $30 
9367 2018-03-22 01:58:39 Carino's wins that one easily with their olive oil/garlic sauce
9368 2018-03-22 01:58:36 All righty: Pantaloons and bloomer fabric are percolating in a mixture of tea, cinnamon and baby oil. While my fingers are killing me, my garage smells like chai. Also, the mixture came in handy when I saw ants trying to come in from the rain. I rock.
9369 2018-03-22 01:58:28 Money rules and oil trumps equal rights.
Always always follow the money.
9370 2018-03-22 01:58:19 Ideally you put it on the parts of your dev where oil builds up and breaks up your makeup. Like under the eyes, t zone, chin etc.
9371 2018-03-22 01:58:08 No it made a number of clearly erroneous claims (about the amount of oil sands that could be extracted) and the Globe likely decided that they wanted to remain a paper that printed factually correct copy
9372 2018-03-22 01:57:53 coconut oil is life
9373 2018-03-22 01:57:52 Equal weights of coconut oil, Shea butter and beeswax. With peppermint extract. Might add more beeswax next time. Worried it is a little soft. But we’ll see.
9374 2018-03-22 01:57:17 Yeahhhhhh that’s not an accurate picture of the workforce at all. As someone who has worked in oil & gas, been laid off by companies without cause, and having had to find jobs in recessions, it seldom works that way in this economy.
9375 2018-03-22 01:57:13 1. 45 million dollars 
2. All my families, including mine credits sitting on fat 8’s 
3. Land w/ oil connected on it . ( so we can be rich foreverrrrrr )
9376 2018-03-22 01:57:07 Just splashed 350 degree oil on my hand 
9377 2018-03-22 01:56:46 i’m pouring tea tree oil all over my face
9378 2018-03-22 01:56:46 First time changing my own oil, barely survived...
9379 2018-03-22 01:56:44 @RepMattGaetz is it true that you have some Russian oil magnet contributing to your financing. seen your name in a publication in st Petersburg last week.
@POTUS
9380 2018-03-22 01:56:42 His story's like two years old. He's hanging on to the glory days. We're gonna end up like W. Virginia when that oil money dries up and they ain't gonna understand how or why.
9381 2018-03-22 01:56:38 @MBuhari  You are a laughing stock among world leaders. My only concern is the niger delta oil money you are using to negotiate with your empowered terrorists. Nemesis will catch up with you soon

9385 2018-03-22 01:56:16 @JoyVBehar I guess you missed that Trump is doing everything he can to destroy the economy of Russia. Russia has a petroleum based economy. The US is the world's largest producer of oil. The more we produce the lower the international price, crushing Russia.
9386 2018-03-22 01:55:53 Sure wish you wouldn't cow down to Democrats Ryan. This is like getting castor oil with the brownie. Neither tastes good.

9403 2018-03-22 01:53:06 whole lotta people have "discovered" these oil memes, eh?

What we are having as testimonies is Grace. 
They are little tokens God is giving us to keep us alive.
The real power is not working as it is showed because the oil is not able to penetrate into our hearts.

9428 2018-03-22 01:49:15 I guess we'll eventually find out what they were really up to, but the 'psychographics' angle to Cambridge Analytic kind of makes me doubt what Emmet Otter's old man was thinking when he said "there just aren't enough people who want to oil a snake."

9434 2018-03-22 01:48:19 I think they mainly tried to make it illegal because some of the oil contains very minute trace amounts of thc. Which is stupid as hell. I never understood lawmakers and politics over this shit anyways.

9481 2018-03-22 01:41:33 You are right. It seems like it is politics. For or against Buhari it is unwise for individuals to have so much money that they can destabilize the country. Oil blocks should be held in trust for Nigeria. The present trend will upturn the country. NO WINNERS!

9513 2018-03-22 01:34:46 Doesn’t seem like this propaganda effort went over well.  The flammable discolored water may still make some high maintenance people uncomfortable. Or the occasional oil spill or oil rig explosion destroying our environment and wildlife.

9543 2018-03-22 01:29:15 That's what you get for voting for a socialist anti-American criminal regime. Hugo Chavez dug #Venezuela grave  despite record oil prices and Maduro is burying it. Venezuela is going to become a colony of Russia and China

9545 2018-03-22 01:29:09 Oligarchy can stifle capitalism by creating an imbalance that suffocates innovation and competition. Example, Big Oil and Coal can kill Green tech in the US. China can then become a world leader in emerging energy sources thus leaving the US behind.

9606 2018-03-22 01:21:42 All the oil oligarchs are financially linked in common financial interests & financial ties.

9631 2018-03-22 01:18:28 I want to try the recipe from @WaPoFood the orange olive oil cake. Looks delicious...
9632 2018-03-22 01:18:16 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

9642 2018-03-22 01:17:02 #IT105_SP18 David McCandless’s Ted Talk gave me a better understanding on data visualization. He changed, “Data is the new oil” to “data is the new soil” to say how “data is fertile”. I thought this was an interesting concept that I could further look into.

9664 2018-03-22 01:13:48 I've never been the kinda person attracted to the idea of slathering myself in some form of oil and baking out in the sun like a cookie... like I've definitely tried it but-
1. the sun is too bright 
2. its so fuckin sweaty 
3. impossible to sit still for that long

I do agree it should be monitored like any other drug/medication.
It should not be wildly on the streets.

He did not look away
He felt compassion

He has oil and wine
He bandaged him
He put him on his own donkey
He took him to the hospital 
He took care of him
He made provision 
He gave extra He planned to return Don't despise

9706 2018-03-22 01:07:11 Donald, you are not worthy. We know it, you know it, your family knows it. You’ve had your fun, give it up now & go back to the sale of snake oil - which is the bit you truly enjoy.
9707 2018-03-22 01:06:57 They are grifters. They are making huge money selling their snake oil $27 at a time.

9709 2018-03-22 01:06:50 Ergo, Burnaby refinery only sources roughly ~50% of its light crude requirements via TMP IIRC. The rest? Via 110-unit behemoth BNSF oil tanker trains from North Dakota's Bakken Basin. These oil tanker trains traverse Fraser River watershed - along Semiahmoo Bay, Boundary Bay, etc

9721 2018-03-22 01:04:49 Let's talk about #transmountain tariffs.
At $19/m3 to the WB term @KM_Canada gets $3.05/bar to ship oil that can be sold for $25+ more than what the US pays.
Gas to fill your tank? $.019/L. Rest of BC pays avg 1.21/L.
Add .019 and you pay $1.23.
I see why you'd be mad.

9724 2018-03-22 01:04:07 You are probably right, though I am at least heartened that folks are using words like 'anti-trust' & 'public utility' in conversations about platforms, rather than just 'connectivity' and 'progress.' A world without Standard Oil was probably unimaginable, but then it happened.
9725 2018-03-22 01:04:01 Honestly just super quickly, olive oil garlic, saute for 10 mins covered. I put some soy sauce, chili infused seasme oil and garlic cos it's going in a noodle stirfy
9726 2018-03-22 01:03:55 @derma_e makes a great rose oil cleanser and I have some KBEAUTY one from amazon that’s pretty cheap. Another tip is only spurge on what stays longest on your skin: serum/moisturizer. Cleansers you just need to get the kind right for ur skin type
9727 2018-03-22 01:03:36 I’ll never be as skinny as these bitches so I’m just gonna start using a lot of oil in my cooking. I might as well eat well while I’m gaining weight

9729 2018-03-22 01:03:27 But trying to approach problems the exact same way will never solve the problem (gun control needs to be more strict). Also trumps policies with not believing in global warming and not pushing for renewable energy over oil is the most ridiculous thing ever. The science is there.
9730 2018-03-22 01:03:23 Tea tree oil works wonders for hair growth and clear skin!

It’s a very dirty situation, but it suits both parties…

9740 2018-03-22 01:02:08 I think it has something to do with Putin having them over the Oil Barrel.  They are dependent on Putin & not liking it. The only thing standing between UK and Putin is Trump USA.  They want US to spill blood for them.
9741 2018-03-22 01:02:02 also don't forget - Murdoch and Cheny [iraq warmonger] have interests in an engery co in the Golan Heights - stolen land from Syria where there are large deposits of oil and gas. - so who benefits .....?
9742 2018-03-22 01:01:57 @amodic1 and I clearly had the same thoughts looking at this coconut oil.
9743 2018-03-22 01:01:56 But even with dosing inconsistencies and the experimental nature of all of this, I am still glad to not have to drop $40 on a tiny bottle of oil, y'know?
9744 2018-03-22 01:01:54 Kessel and Brassard have chemistry like oil and water

9748 2018-03-22 01:01:05 I agree. He was the ringleader and pulled in the other imperialist nations who were hoping to control #Libya's oil. All of them were totally insane
9749 2018-03-22 01:00:59 Real pro life people want free high quality prenatal care and postnatal care to decrease miscarriages, maternal mortality, infant mortality.  Pollution from coal, oil increases miscarriages, maternal mortality, infant mortality.  Enemies of human life do not care about pollution
9750 2018-03-22 01:00:56 root. no offence. you're hot, you're good with a gun, those are two qualities i greatly admire, but you and me together would be like a four alarm fire at an oil refinery.

9754 2018-03-22 01:00:16 Could I ask you a question about CBD oil?
9755 2018-03-22 01:00:00 Yes, I too can easily see the decline in positivity in my tweets the past few weeks. Not coincidentally, I can feel it too. Oh well. I bought some beard oil today. It's like anything else, it's cheaper to buy all the ingredients to mix it yourself, but only in the long run.
9756 2018-03-22 00:59:57 Le quitaron Oil para resguazarla y entregarla a Pampa Energía de Mindlin y Lewis y las obras q tenía adjudicadas con la constructora se las dan a Calcaterra o algún otro socio o testaferro!  Negocio redondo
9757 2018-03-22 00:59:48 I think a lot of churchgoers need to check their “spiritual dipstick” and see if they have any “oil” !?  That’s what Jesus warned about.  
No Holy Spirit, no relationship w/ a Living Savior.
9758 2018-03-22 00:59:42 I didn’t try it this morning because I soaked my hair in oil last night but I’m going to in the morning
9759 2018-03-22 00:59:19 lol oil field got you ugly huh
9760 2018-03-22 00:59:15 yeah that's why i wondered if you did or not, because chronic pain and what not. even my mom has used CBD oil for a while in TN (where it's still illegal btw) for her Fibro.
9761 2018-03-22 00:59:00 Chavez nationalized the oil fields and put his minions, who had no clue how to run an oil company, in charge. Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world, can’t profit off it and capitalism is to blame? You are stretching to make your narrative fit.
9762 2018-03-22 00:59:00 Yup. They have oil and they want money.
9763 2018-03-22 00:58:58 What an ignorant doughball CA has in political office. Pandering and peddling snake oil to the uninformed masses of sheep. Where does the money come from for Tuition Free college?  Oh yeah, the rich people.  Maybe start with the Hollywood elitist?  Running a college isn’t FREE!
9764 2018-03-22 00:58:56 180 last game. Lot of carry issues and alot of oil pushed down. Washed out a couple times and luckily was able to convert
9765 2018-03-22 00:58:52 Haven’t sold any personally but most have a side hustle or two.  Education < big oil.
9766 2018-03-22 00:58:44 Mixing of 2 ingredients that won’t emulsify & remain separated. Like oil & wTer
9767 2018-03-22 00:58:38 WOW this is rude. i ordered a carrying case for oil pastels and i had a lot to say about it and this is how you do me?

9771 2018-03-22 00:57:26 Who you telling! Niggas were raking over $100k with regularity during the oil/energy boom
9772 2018-03-22 00:57:22 Cliff Barnes wasn't just trying to beat ol' JR! He was doing it for his daddy Digger Barnes, cheated out of his oil wells and wealth decades before by Jock Ewing!
9773 2018-03-22 00:57:04 #Bernard now has new front pads, rotors, calipers, and an oil change. He is a happy #Subie. Now to work on exhaust, end links, diffs, trans/transfer case fluids, and coolant flush. Long road ahead, but he'll be a good car.
9774 2018-03-22 00:56:41 whenever @troyesivan tweets, he's the girl who puts oil all over the floor and i'm the child who smashes into the oven
9775 2018-03-22 00:56:35 If someone could just oil me down right quick that would be great.
9776 2018-03-22 00:56:13 Coconut oil is a blessing
9777 2018-03-22 00:56:00 i mainly use argan oil dye and sometimes ion but i really don’t prefer them

9778 2018-03-22 00:55:31 while the rest talks of oily leni.

9779 2018-03-22 00:55:31 T4 show me the (snake oil) evidence. problems are #1 good ideas ->decr inflammation (statins also didn't work in the ANZ-STATInS trial, APC withdrawn) but might still not work, and #2 subgroups/effect size combos still unclear #pulmCC
9780 2018-03-22 00:55:25 Portland Flower Show. Look for my olive oil!
9781 2018-03-22 00:55:20 So was coal, but history and logic aren't your strong suit are they? Norway and the Saudis are looking to get away from oil. EV is the future. The US needs to get there as well. But despite all the liars trying to preserve the past, the future is already here.

9789 2018-03-22 00:54:34 Oil constitutes about 95% of Nigeria's general revenue.
9790 2018-03-22 00:54:32 No I don't think so, he lost to him on numerous occasions, but by the end, Cliff did end up becoming owner of Ewing Oil.

9793 2018-03-22 00:54:09 Definitely cannot do it on its own, if Russia goes to that path I believe that is already determined to influence in the Eurozone, as they have already started building leverage that can be translated in power through oil & gas, gold reserves, and foreign reserve.
9794 2018-03-22 00:54:08 BREAKING: The CRA Street Stock season-opener @ Lucas Oil Raceway, scheduled for Sunday, has been cancelled due to weather.

Sorry for any inconvenience, But Mother Nature isn’t a race fan.
9795 2018-03-22 00:53:36 @PMOIndia And this is not a one time PETROL OIL LOOT scam. This is the calculation of the amount that is looted from the customers every year. A colossal Rs 30000 crore per year. If the 2005 parliamentary committee report is implemented imagine what the country stands to save.

9806 2018-03-22 00:51:36 I mixed it all in a large bowl with oil but then drizzled extra once I’d put them in the pan. Recipe called for them to roast for 40-45 mins but I kept them in longer to crisp up.
9807 2018-03-22 00:51:25 Also we have to factor in oil as another possibility for exchanging intelligence of the Saudi Prince enemies as Trump wants to keep our enemies happy by offering them a deal and that keeps the Prince happy, debt reduced, oil and golf course open by exchange!

9823 2018-03-22 00:49:53 El ICL es un impuesto propio de Oil Combustibles, al igual que el IVA. Es un error -bastante grosero a mi entender- decir que existió percepción en función del efecto ECONÓMICO (no JURÍDICO) del impuesto. Y,además, si hay o no percepción, es irrelevante para la adm. fraud. agrav.

But let’s be clear, it was LNG and drilling that did it. Then the price dropped and we got screwed too. Shit deal

9862 2018-03-22 00:44:17 That jives with the gov revenues from non-oil sources.  In current terms, it has been relatively flat for the last decade.  Oil's been the big cash cow and gov boosted spending based on it.  When oil dropped, the problems started.

9878 2018-03-22 00:41:34 You are trading one form of corruption for another.
Honestly, though...if an oil company goes rogue and does excessive harm, we have governments we can convince to make them stop.
When government is in control and does excessive harm, the only solution is revolution.

9882 2018-03-22 00:41:13 If it wasn’t honey was it oil or what I’m lost. Maybe it wasn’t cheese but it was small and you judged me for not trying it the first time it wad offered
9883 2018-03-22 00:41:05 I’m Daniel Plainview.
This is my son and colleague H.W. Plainview. I’m an oil man, you see
9884 2018-03-22 00:40:49 get some bio oil!!
9885 2018-03-22 00:40:47 Com'on Micia! NATO was just exploiting us. And he didn't shun them. He only ask for more and somewhat equal contribution. And take it from a veteran! He's only about our interest! Hes trying to prevent civil war in Saudi, because back in the 70s when Saudi reduce oil production..
9886 2018-03-22 00:40:40 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9887 2018-03-22 00:40:40 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.

9892 2018-03-22 00:40:13 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
9893 2018-03-22 00:40:02 Snopes. Neither do I. Moving forward the industry will clean up. But will no longer be forced to impossible positions. Favorite Obama Ploy. Check out just how dirty manufacturing Electric Cars and the Oil Fuel expended for the electricity.
9894 2018-03-22 00:39:48 one of them new jets that runs on used fryer oil obviously.
9895 2018-03-22 00:39:38 for real: when the President lies, a sane person writes a song about #love
9896 2018-03-22 00:39:37 You know that smell when your car is burning oil? How it usually smells like a dead animal on the side of the road? My fat ass thought it smelled like fired chicken!! 
9897 2018-03-22 00:39:33 This makes me so sick! Pit bulls have skin problems anyway-no gluten food and fish & vitamin E oil in his food will help this baby along with alot of love.
9898 2018-03-22 00:39:30 LUX OIL Russian gas stations here in America they are involved in collecting data for Cambridge Analytics lets boycott all these businesses that are a detriment to our democracy  we have to speak out
9899 2018-03-22 00:39:25 I was just talking about tee tree oil in my video today .
9900 2018-03-22 00:39:12 Careful. 1995. Oklahoma City. Timothy McVeigh. Terry Nichols. Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil. 168 killed. 680 injured. Building destroyed.

There are controls, but it can still be done. Not that I would try it... #NoSiree
9901 2018-03-22 00:39:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i started crying over pizza please give me a sip nyehehehe.
9902 2018-03-22 00:39:04 Ah yes, using chapstick and moisturizer.

Because I like when my face feels like an oil slick.
9903 2018-03-22 00:38:42 Lol hi, I don’t know where you got the info from but imports/ exports are not the drivers of Ghana’s GDP growth.
It’s mostly been oil and sticking to the terms/ directives of the IMF Programme for economic recovery which was extended for an extra year.
There’s more I could add...
9904 2018-03-22 00:38:35 hmmm equally; if one is an environmentalist, can one short oil?
9905 2018-03-22 00:38:16 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9906 2018-03-22 00:38:15 Just repo'ed oil. Behave accordingly!!
9907 2018-03-22 00:38:13 On this snowy night I’m home sipping brews and hitting this oil pen 
9908 2018-03-22 00:38:11 Just found out that oil is a renewable energy and not actually from fossils. isn’t ugly or take up space. cheaper and more reliable. Before you bring up pollution, that’s where trees come in. STOP CUTING DOWN THE FORRESTS.
9909 2018-03-22 00:37:55 Cry more, Lou, cry more. You are now the worst kind of political hack blinded by a snake oil salesman.
9910 2018-03-22 00:37:53 @MayorTomCanine 
Congratulations on getting CBD oil back. When we going to see you WJOB live?
9911 2018-03-22 00:37:40 @ThatDamn_Mesha We hear you there. Did you get the oil changed yet?
9912 2018-03-22 00:37:32 Other, actually healthy things I do: hot bath, a favorite book, a walk, lavender oil, etc. If I'm super wired I'll do a bunch of crunches or something before I do these relaxing things
9913 2018-03-22 00:37:24 LOLOL! I use a Nubian sponge & oil sheen protective hair spray!
9914 2018-03-22 00:37:20 "I’m trying to establish if this is 100% true" was in response to someone who suggested you work for an oil splill cleanup company I did not state that was true.  
My clarification:  I have seen no evidence that Blair works for a company that has a stake in oil spill cleanup.
9915 2018-03-22 00:37:19 I have read the climate 'science' propaganda going back as far as the 1950s.
I see clearly.
All of this is snake oil, sold to gullible people.
Scams with the blessing of corrupt politicians.
9916 2018-03-22 00:37:17 Pretty excited CBD oil is now legal again.. I was looking into right as it became illegal  Now time to give it a try 
9917 2018-03-22 00:37:09 Drink Every time she tells you to use “GOOD olive oil” or invites her gay friends over for floral arrangement and tablescape lessons.
9918 2018-03-22 00:37:02 God bless coconut oil
9919 2018-03-22 00:36:21 How is it McKenna will force a carbon tax on every province; yet Trudeau, will do nothing to force BC and protesters to stand down? This gov has no intentions to aid oil industry.
9920 2018-03-22 00:35:32 Isn't that every gas station, though? Motor oil and pancetta is more of a feat.
9921 2018-03-22 00:35:27 Please Repent please  Keep your eyes up to the sky! Is your oil full? Personal relationship with Jesus! Read your Bible's,and Pray! Spread GOSPEL to the lost! Always looking for Jesus every single day 
9922 2018-03-22 00:34:59 Jolly rancher freeze pops oil
9923 2018-03-22 00:34:57 Last night I dreamt a game that was basically Taboo crossed with Snake Oil. I think it might even work
9924 2018-03-22 00:34:48 Why does the United States deal with Saudi Arabia at all? I know it’s for the oil. But really are we  that desperate?
9925 2018-03-22 00:34:40 Auxiliary heater that runs independently of the engine. They have a small output fan so as not to drain the battery. A mini oil heater in effect
9926 2018-03-22 00:34:28 think of where we would be if we had only continued to develop wind, water and battery power instead of pushing it to the back seat while develop oil, gas and nuclear power. we had those first three over 100 years ago and we let that lose out to the last 3. 100 years wasted.
9927 2018-03-22 00:34:22 A4. I have used and made natural oil remedies for myself and for others. I also have used CBD oil currently which has made a huge difference. Also a few other things similar to accupuncture and massage techniques. Had more to deal with post chemo than during #LBBCchat #BCSM #TNBC
9928 2018-03-22 00:34:18 Canadian  economy has no independent control over monetary policy: it’s a myth! Failure 2 align 2 US Fed, plus high levels of Canadian Govrnt debt, will accelerate investment exit! Oil/primary resource dependant economy with no imminent certainty on trade! Self inflicted demise

9930 2018-03-22 00:33:59 @drjkahn No oil is optimal. BUT  hypothetically Olive vs Vegetable Vs Canola.  Who wins?
9931 2018-03-22 00:33:56 @_dregina Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
9932 2018-03-22 00:33:54 We sell CBD OIL at our Wellness Center in West Reading PA. $64.99. Email me to find out more Rick@h2o4lifewc.com

9935 2018-03-22 00:32:53 $70 for an oil change  momo is eating up all my money
9936 2018-03-22 00:32:34 Kudos to u for having strong intestinal fortitude Joe. I for one am stunned at what Oil has been doing this week, especially today and decided to take a back seat. My gut tells me to short but am too afraid to pull the trigger ...
9937 2018-03-22 00:32:32 Take Sunflower oil out of your products and I'll buy them.  #sunflowerallergy
9938 2018-03-22 00:32:26 Frackin? Would that be oil business talk there?

9940 2018-03-22 00:32:16 The yanks help put Saddam in power...he got uppity and threatened their oil interests and the US conjured up an excuse to wage war. We supported, we were complicit

9944 2018-03-22 00:31:31 Use coconut oil for skin care
9945 2018-03-22 00:31:31 @rdpallday I just got some OG Kush vape oil yesterday. Shit  too.
9946 2018-03-22 00:31:16 So, if I understand you correctly it was Kushner who fired Rex Tillerson? Or at least partly. Very strange! And just unbelievable enough to fit into the narrative perfectly. It was a rare Trump family oil play. The Saudis must've wanted the Exxon oil man out.
9947 2018-03-22 00:31:10 Just made one of the more epic grilled cheese EVER.  Gruyere, and original boursin, some spinach on there, and done with coconut oil.  SOOOOOOOOO good.  Think I'm in love.  (plus tasty creamy tomato soup for dipping)
9948 2018-03-22 00:31:09 Korte mo muna bebe. Huhu caster oil is the key..
9949 2018-03-22 00:31:02 When I Grill I'll take some fresh garlic cloves, put them in a little foil bowl with olive oil put them on the top rack of the grill and then while I'm cooking whatever it is steak tips chicken these things come out they are just crazy good.
I'm a garlic nut! Lol
9950 2018-03-22 00:31:00 BRUH IM OBSESSED W COCONUT OIL!!!!!!  It’s a must!!!!!!!
9951 2018-03-22 00:30:46 @TheJessExpo FYI. Gov Holcomb signed the CBD Oil bill today. You and many others made this happen. My mom was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I want to have her try it. Thank you for this chance.
9952 2018-03-22 00:30:43 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
9953 2018-03-22 00:30:26 OIL DIFF: 4.39 -> 4.41
9954 2018-03-22 00:30:12 nak pergi conference oil and gas kat klcc hari ni, tapi terlupa lak aku dah tukar industy. haha
9955 2018-03-22 00:30:09 Yep. Zuck has lots of lobbyists,  so between NRA, Big Pharma, oil/gas & tax payer sexual misdeeds only Congress wins.
9956 2018-03-22 00:30:04 The "troops invading for oil" meme but for Gregg Valentino's biceps.
9957 2018-03-22 00:29:48 The
Leaking sump oil from the container ships keeps the water warmer
For longer in port
9958 2018-03-22 00:29:36 HMmmmmmm....been off all day and just tried to share a feed on FB no go e I can tweet . I can share the inside of the article no videos etc .I may need a Oil Rig Cowboy badge to share
9959 2018-03-22 00:29:11 Sooo...the "energy sphere". I'm assuming that's oil drilling?
9960 2018-03-22 00:29:04 Roasted, baked, boiled, mashed, fried... so many choices! Mine tonight were roasted in some browned butter/grapeseed oil, tyme, and salt/pepper.
9961 2018-03-22 00:28:59 Come to my oil party this weekend! We are having snacks and it’ll be great 
9962 2018-03-22 00:28:57 the most revealing explanation for Gods acceptance of cannabis is the ancient Hebrew anointing oil. Historical examples show it to contain large amounts of cannabis sap/extract or dabs (lol) they called it "Kaneh Bosem" 
Jesus used it too
9963 2018-03-22 00:28:47 I put pure vitamin E oil in the wound  probs not right but lol
9964 2018-03-22 00:28:38 Com 150 reais desse creme vocês: começam um tratamento de 1 sessão na priscila palazzo, compram bio oil que AJUDA NÃO TIRA estrias
9965 2018-03-22 00:28:25 I plan on working with fiber and collage moving forward. Do any artists want to go through some major oil painting supplies ?
9966 2018-03-22 00:28:03 That sounds great!  We've been to a place in Morocco that presses olive oil via the old school method involving a donkey and huge stone wheel, but alas no harvesting... #foodtravelchat
9967 2018-03-22 00:27:29 If the world wants to subsidize other energy forms, oil companies will gladly change their names to energy companies and supply that too. BP has already.
9968 2018-03-22 00:27:28 I made it with coconut oil and put a few drops of tea tree and citrus essential oils, but the cool part is you can make it your own! So you can customize it to your skin’s specific needs! It’s seriously changed the game for me.
9969 2018-03-22 00:27:08 Yes socialism rocks. Back to the caves. No fires though as wood is bad for the air. Only the top 10% survive with ever higher food and energy costs. I have heard it all before in the 1970s .. the end of growth BS and the end of oil and resources by the year 2000 .. its all BS !
9970 2018-03-22 00:27:05 Well, I got my oil change today, and then I went to get gas, and then I locked my keys in my car, and then I got them out, and got a car wash. 
9971 2018-03-22 00:26:45 I did just stumble across an Oil Can Boyd just for you Mets fans cc @fobbywobby
9972 2018-03-22 00:26:39 Only products I use in my hair is Aussie, Crece Pelo, Cantu, castor oil/grease, and gel  sometimes aloe!!
9973 2018-03-22 00:26:27 I wished to say that all people who call themselves Israeli must be Zionists to a degree.  And then, I thought of @DBarenboim, who has done so much good to pour gentle oil on the troubled waters there, who has both Israeli and Palestinian citizenship.

9975 2018-03-22 00:26:24 I love olive oil literally inside/outside the body ...
9976 2018-03-22 00:26:20 Please correct me if wrong, since they did raise in Dec '15 when oil was at $35 and China and European banks were struggling, would/could that have classified as a policy mistake had they not waited 12 months before raising again?
9977 2018-03-22 00:26:11 Alaskans own 4,877 shares of ABAN OFFSHORE LTD, worth $16,910. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDIA.
9978 2018-03-22 00:26:07 So I’m in the kitchen talking to my mother inlaw and I go outside & Joel is doing the oil change on my car 
9979 2018-03-22 00:25:53 Frankincense oil, darling! Add a drop to your moisturizer and you will be transcended. #trustme #plantjuiceworks
9980 2018-03-22 00:25:49 One of Iya'beji's businesses processes and distributes coconut and its derivatives, so I will just use oil and shafts in most of their meals.
9981 2018-03-22 00:25:32 Tasers: if you're wrestling with someone, and you tase them mid-grapple, will the current drop you as well? For the sake of physics, assume no one's overly sweaty, it's not Turkish oil wrestling, and you're not in a kiddy pool filled with creamed corn. 

Just asking for a friend.

9984 2018-03-22 00:25:16 Okay so get a good primer I recommend the Becca stay matte primer, and I really like the Rihanna fenty foundation and my skin type is similar to yours. Also make sure you have a good moisturizer (I like the Mario badescu oil free one) and a good setting powder!
9985 2018-03-22 00:24:51 @SantosFC Wasted many chances. Hopefully you will lose this tie.
9986 2018-03-22 00:24:49 This damn headache is still sticking around even though I slept almost all day. I don't want to keep popping Advil, so I made an essential oil rollerball blend to try. 
9987 2018-03-22 00:24:40 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
9988 2018-03-22 00:24:32 Gov't closed the mines and shuttered the steel plant to force the workforce out west. It was predicted years b4 it happened when big oil were pumping money into the oil sands. Gov't knew, they just didn't do anything about it.

9990 2018-03-22 00:24:15 Omg dyin! I did a twelve step program too buuuut all the steps were clogging and bleaching my brown face. So, I'm on a no-SPF, sunshine, no foundation or concealer, simple gel cleanser and an oil of sea buckthorn, hemp, pomegranate, pumpkin seed, lavender, orange and rosemary.
9991 2018-03-22 00:23:52 I want hemp body oil
9992 2018-03-22 00:23:35 May also be to clamp down on capital flight. Lot of Chinese firms were using fake invoices to exchange CNY into USD for “purchasing oil”, only to really get dollars out of the country. China is desperately trying to keep its system stable and clamp down on such activity.
9993 2018-03-22 00:23:34 It's a marketing issue.
9994 2018-03-22 00:23:34 Riiight

Those regs he repealed
clean air & water
safety on oil wells
consumer protections 
destroyed Consumer Protection agency
GOP repealed Dodd-Frank so big banks can screw consumers again - remember 2008?

For this we should say Thanks?

9999 2018-03-22 00:22:49 Dayum. My guess was religiously-applied coconut oil and deep scalp massages. 

Point: Dunlop.
10000 2018-03-22 00:22:42 Why does my oil change have to be so expensive 
10001 2018-03-22 00:22:30 still thinking about the cute guy at the oil change place who kept touching my hand and calling me sweetheart who knows this one
10002 2018-03-22 00:22:29 I really need to stop procrastinating on stupid shit like getting my oil changed 
10003 2018-03-22 00:22:29 The main drive is to stop the Canadian oil industry! The tanker traffic is just a gimmick used to stop oil flowing through pipelines!
10004 2018-03-22 00:22:27 Put some on a cotton ball and dab your face then apply tea tree oil on your face

10006 2018-03-22 00:22:08 2/2 $EMC is company with cash, a lisence, and a growing range of flower and oil offerings. Trading at a discounted premium —-  which sets the stage for a takeover. (IMHO) #CanadaPotStocks  
10007 2018-03-22 00:22:02 Mercy!  Actually,  I made my own candy,  too.  Cocoa powder,  coconut oil,  and Truvia or stevia. Add extracts or peanut flour.   Good stuff!  But store it in the fridge or freezer.
10008 2018-03-22 00:21:56 no better feeling than washing your face and doing a face mask and being moisturized and hydrated and coconut oil and chapstick and just being 
10009 2018-03-22 00:21:51 @MikeHudema give your balls a tug ya bloody hypocritical moron . BTW thanks for supporting the oil industry every time you use your phone, drive your car or do anything really that requires technology or store bought goods. It helps me keep my 200k salary in the oil patch
