39 2018-07-02 23:55:44 And who exactly are the 2,360 people who “liked” this explanation?  Fans of cowardly crypto-racists?  Supportive of hiring racist slugs, and then backing away from responsibility for it?  What the actual fuck is happening on the right wing these days?
40 2018-07-02 23:55:40 Plus in San Antonio and in San Diego we have ATMs where you can buy and sell crypto for cash. So that's kinda cool.

45 2018-07-02 23:54:57 Do you think Facebook too will release it's coin in future?

Mark promised he will understand Blockchain and crypto.

Crypto Ad ban lift and Coinbase rumours points surely means something.
46 2018-07-02 23:54:56 I'm so broken down cause of all the scam ICOs that come nowadays. God, bless guys that do projects that give me back a hope that crypto is our future. Turn your attention to this #sportsledger_io

48 2018-07-02 23:54:26  they were shocked to hear some of the stuff I tell them about. Like one day recently I mentioned something about Crypto Currency cuz my dad was talking about it and my mom was like "how do you know about that?" & I said "I learned about it on #GMM"

51 2018-07-02 23:52:34 Insane idea. Do they not know how heavily PokemonGo got botted with automatic movers and location spoofing... and they want to give away money? Time to fire up BlueStacks again and collect some some crypto.
52 2018-07-02 23:52:29 hey @CryptoWonka : as one of the best minds in crypto - any chance I could pick your brain for thoughts on #MinerOne?

55 2018-07-02 23:51:18 Yes, right now use is primarily financial transactions but once we start leveraging thepower of  the bc network crypto will pay for network computung time, for goods and stand for equity on the network
56 2018-07-02 23:51:10 Yeah, I’m pretty sure we’ll see the ATH this year. Because of the lack of regulations we are all in before the majority of instructional investors, this is what will eventually make us rich 
57 2018-07-02 23:51:01 What $XRP is trying to do with money transfer $SC is trying to do with data transfer. 

$SC has far more upward potential and their devs actually give a shit
58 2018-07-02 23:50:38 I did, I get the whole weird looking Einstein thing, but he’s got an obvious bent towards the technology side of crypto...given my original question I obviously have my doubts, but figured it doesn’t hurt to ask:)
59 2018-07-02 23:50:26 This looks awesome, and I'm definitely trying to learn more about the crypto space after listening to the "Unconfirmed" Pod: Joseph Rucker: Temple University Fox School of Business: Live in South Jersey
60 2018-07-02 23:50:18 On one hand it increases the value of everyone else's assets by increasing scarcity, analogous to a burn in crypto. Also decreases inequality and materialism. I don't understand the social aspects but Mauss' The Gift looks like a solid starting point. Earning to give up.
