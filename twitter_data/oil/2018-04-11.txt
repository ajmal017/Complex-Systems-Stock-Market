Some people think it’s bs, others swear by it - I already love how relaxed it makes me feel and am curious to see if there will be noticeable differences

7 2018-04-11 23:59:00 You talking about smoking flower or edibles, big difference! Been smoking for decades. Never hallucinated at any dosage. Edibles I ate some yrs ago before the high thc content was around and it was the last time. Bad experience! Now use CBD/THC oil and THC oil for sleep. No probs

9 2018-04-11 23:58:40 Wonder if @PreparedBC, @EmergencyInfoBC and/or @MarineResponse were alerted to this casualty, and put on standby in case there was an oil spill threat associated with it.
10 2018-04-11 23:58:30 Actually being a volunteer @SFU on top of oil storage tanks is very unsettling. Why don't you come up to @SFU for some time? BC getting up to 50 full time jobs after KM expands while bearing most of fire and marine risk is not worth it for Lower Mainland.

40 2018-04-11 23:57:23 Oil. Oil, oil. Oil, and pipelines, strategic positioning to go down Africa for the rest of the resources to be siphoned off by the western nations, give some to Israel, get more from the Saudis, and cause genocide, the likes the world has ever seen, til they become indoctrinated.
41 2018-04-11 23:57:21 Umm, Smoothie Girl is awesome. How else am I supposed to learn about oil that is three times (3x fool) better than the leading competitors

44 2018-04-11 23:57:06 This is in BC's best interest as they have lost confidence in their ability to handle oil.  If pipelines are bad how much worse are trucks and rail.  Everybody should be happy.

47 2018-04-11 23:56:27 “There’s an oil for that”.
48 2018-04-11 23:56:24 I mean who doesn't want to lose weight without exercising?

Although in reality in the opposite. I'm trying to gain muscle while training for a half marathon.  Is there an oil to help with that?
49 2018-04-11 23:56:02 I think AB's oil plan is valid constitutionally, but BC's regulation plan isn't.
50 2018-04-11 23:56:02 What a silly, irresponsible decision. @jacindaardern’s impetuosity and desperate desire to virtue signal has just cost our country billions, thrown people out of high paying jobs while not making any of difference to our oil consumption. What a stupid move.
51 2018-04-11 23:55:55 The crack pot oil was thick as fuck!
52 2018-04-11 23:55:47 Thanks for that.  I bought used, didn't take a tax break on it. Reality of ownership is that maintenance costs almost nonexistent, charging costs much less than gas, and I'm immune from from oil price spikes.  Plus, it's a fun ride.  Trust me, I'm as conservative as they come.
53 2018-04-11 23:55:42 Tell me...how many products are in your possession that are oil based. How did you get home tonight? You couldn’t tweet without your cell. Are you saying you are ok with getting oil from anywhere else except Canada??
54 2018-04-11 23:55:22 U are boring me. Who give u raw yeast? Or did oil burn ur face?
55 2018-04-11 23:55:16 I agree. There’s nothing to attack. This is to bolster Trump,because if the blue wave splashes down its over for Putin’s multi billion oil deal. Putin’s gonna cry his troops were wounded and trump gets the flower horseshoe.
56 2018-04-11 23:55:13 Zero, zilch, nada! Dems & corrupt fbi have gone fishing

58 2018-04-11 23:55:06 Lol... turn your oil down to medium high heat to make it not pop... then when you cook put a damn lid on it to keep the steam in...
59 2018-04-11 23:55:04 It's not all about oil, nobody said that.
You aren't an oil investor, or are you ? It's still about oil for those
who are on the business. The Saudis want a gas pipeline in Syria. The goal is to take Iran they need their 
territory to expand the pipelines. It's about weapons too
60 2018-04-11 23:55:02 Love the feeling after a hot shower - a nice gentle rub down with my favorite lavender oil #ILOVEME
61 2018-04-11 23:54:52 Should have been ....
1: No further drilling/mining off shore 2: Subsidised Solar Scheme for households, 3. Contracts for the SSS to be let to those areas that would be highly affected by no further oil/mining exploration.
62 2018-04-11 23:54:20 I realized that the thing my commute was really missing was the pervasive stench of fryer oil trapped underground, so this is a great development.
63 2018-04-11 23:53:57 I like it.   Cartography is still so vitally important to our day-to-day work in the Oil and Gas industry.
64 2018-04-11 23:53:44 Serious question, as hard as I look I haven't found any evidence that significant oil or gas come to British Columbia from Saskatchewan. Anyone know where data on this might be found? @richardzussman #skpoli #ableg #bcpoli
65 2018-04-11 23:53:41 Western Canada is in Stranger Things upside-down right now with a supposedly leftist premier going to battle in support of an oil company, while a right-wing party leader suddenly finds a soft spot for socialism by supporting some manner of public buy-in of said oil company. 
66 2018-04-11 23:53:38 Unknown to many is the fact that oil saved the whales. Up until the mid 1860's whale oil was used in lamps and to grease machinery.
67 2018-04-11 23:53:36 I know families who moved from ILM to Denver bc their child suffers debilitating seizures. CBD Oil, aka; Charlotte's Web is a miracle (for many) and you can injest as much as you fancy, no THC-Receptor Affinity nor Antagoising Properties.
State Legislators, are you listening?

72 2018-04-11 23:53:20 Tire fixed, headlight fixed an oil change days a good day 
73 2018-04-11 23:53:16 men now days spend more time in front of the mirror, than they do in their garage. you're not a man if your pay another man to change your oil, that's what women do!
74 2018-04-11 23:53:11 This is suspicious. Trump states we will leave Syria. Chemical weapons are used days later. Trump warns everyone especially Putin that bombs are on the way. The price of oil skyrockets. This whole thing seems orchestrated to me. Putin wins with the price of oil going up. WTF?
75 2018-04-11 23:53:02 There is no dress on ma dp na. Ur swollen face is now covering ur eyes. Who added yeast to ur face. It'll soon burst open oh . And d face dae shine like u rub engine oil 
76 2018-04-11 23:53:01 They all have a purpose & I do use all of those products 
I'm my opinion I prefer to vaporizer my cbd oil it seams 2 be more effective. 
I also take THC capsule but someone new 2 cannabis might start with a 10mg starter at first & wait for a hour at least & graduate 2 more
77 2018-04-11 23:52:41 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
78 2018-04-11 23:52:33 Omg I thought the same thing! I really thought it was a outline  they can’t put no coconut oil or something on it so it’s not ashy- chalk looking tho? Lmao

86 2018-04-11 23:51:11 Anybody notice all the pro wind TV commercials popping up?  This part of the walkout truly became and is now part of a proxy war between oil and wind. I am seldom in support of corporate welfare. If it’s long term it typically qualifies. #oklaed
87 2018-04-11 23:51:06 aight so main thing you need to know: 
LCO. 
liquid : ( water )
cream: ( water based leave in conditioner )
oil: ( sealing oil- almond, castor, etc not coconut ) 

after you wash ya hurr 1x a week ish ( no more than that otherwise ya hair dry) 
that’s the order you apply product
88 2018-04-11 23:51:01 Eeeewwsh, it's a very spicy take to say that oil drilling saved whales because petroleum replaced whale oil as fuel.
89 2018-04-11 23:50:46 Invest in renewable resources! Oil is so 20th century
90 2018-04-11 23:50:43 For seven months, NNPC did not remit any money into federation account. When I called as a sitting governor and major oil producing state, Deziani Alison Madueke refused to pick my calls. Godswill Akpabio*
91 2018-04-11 23:50:28 I’ve said it before but dont be out here buying spiritual tools off just anyone. If you do, be sure to go through a thorough cleansing process for whatever you purchase. Energy travels with the products & if it’s an elixir or oil whoever made its intentions are charged into it.
92 2018-04-11 23:50:23 One of the four will work. Best oil is castor, second best is Aegean

96 2018-04-11 23:49:46 Don’t over wash/cleanse/treat it. That’s makes it worse. Witch Hazel as a toner (even add some tea tree oil to it) and a good moisturizer is all I use. I barely wash my face, usually only in the shower.
97 2018-04-11 23:49:29 Its insightful to NO ONE but an idiot. The GDP of Texas reflects the oil companies located there but that captures the gasoline that Vermont uses. The GDP of New York includes Philip Morris, but cigs are smoked in Oklahoma too.
98 2018-04-11 23:49:28 Don't deep fry in olive oil. It has a very low smoking point.
99 2018-04-11 23:49:23 I just saw that you are from Que. That tells me enough and don't worry about working we will send you more money from Alberta once we get the oil & gas economy going again or do you have another place to collect your transfer money from? #cdnpoli

104 2018-04-11 23:49:07 $0. I work for a big oil company. Just kidding.
105 2018-04-11 23:48:56 Lol probably my point was that those fines are so small that the oil company won't care anyway

114 2018-04-11 23:47:52 BC mines ugly dirty fossil fuel coal from Elkford, on rail to harbour front Vancouver to be shipped to China, Japan, India & Korea. Why isn’t BC protesting that? Coal, the worst of the worst! Makes Ab oil look clean.

117 2018-04-11 23:47:39 The X-Men celebrate a ban on oil exploration in NZ, except for Bishop, Cable, Rachel, and everyone else from a dystopian future. Departing MP Jonathan Coleman denies ever being aware he was Health Minister, and asks a reporter "what is a 'health'?"
118 2018-04-11 23:47:37 Yeah tea tree oil is really great for spot treatment, but I feel like the key is using toner twice a day, because it just gets all the extra stuff out of your pores after you wash your face. I use witch hazel for a toner
119 2018-04-11 23:47:20 He should replace it with an oil derrick melting in a super hot sun

126 2018-04-11 23:46:53 Thanks tons Tracy; I checked back on the second gulf war in 2003 - looks like oil headed up in anticipation of the war but then corrected significantly as soon as, or a little bit after the war actually started. Its only 2 samples but looks like oil gets overhyped around wars.
127 2018-04-11 23:46:43 I’m having this Thai ice coffee and I’m pretty sure it’s just motor oil and milk.
128 2018-04-11 23:46:27 Olive oil must be good for my laptop keyboard, no??
129 2018-04-11 23:46:26 It’s not the ‘Hey, sugary treats are bad’ posts that are the issue. It’s the other shit. But this is how snake oil salesmen work. They wrap their junk ideas in enough everyday stuff we ALL agree with, in order to give their lies and dodgy data the veneer of authenticity.
130 2018-04-11 23:46:19 Ending oil exploration is about as controversial as getting out of the way of a speeding train...cmon lets move on and start making jobs with futures
131 2018-04-11 23:46:19 Nice way of creating confusion in public. Rearely people are aware about cycle speed of drilling an oil well displayed by picture shown.

135 2018-04-11 23:46:01 I'll get the coconut oil and and get back to you. 
136 2018-04-11 23:45:56 You can’t have a weak mind & be in my life. We going end up like water & oil.
137 2018-04-11 23:45:53 Do you consume products and services that utilize oil?
Why do you insist that the oil come from another country and place that burden on them?
138 2018-04-11 23:45:30 Gulf oil
139 2018-04-11 23:45:29 Did you ever wonder how potatoes first got cut into strips and thrown into boiling oil? It's from a series of tweets like this. Lol
140 2018-04-11 23:45:17 I USED TO put my son in a bath with epsom salts. you can get them at dollar tree even. or the regular walgreens type store. usually near the cotton balls and bandaids. it is relaxing. also Lavender essential oil calms me! put on my skin and breath in .
141 2018-04-11 23:45:14 Bruce Lawson the only pound that will fall is sterling mate on its own no oil and out of the eu
142 2018-04-11 23:45:12 If oil was always the issue behind war, Canada would be the 51st state
143 2018-04-11 23:45:07 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
144 2018-04-11 23:45:02 i just started getting into this and all i use is a moisturize, jojoba oil and i use the aloe from the plant every now and then. i’ve heard great things about tea tree oil though
145 2018-04-11 23:44:56 brought my spring equinox oil to work today. was rushing to get changed, and i must not have closed it all the way before i slipped it back in my bag, and 97% of the oil is spilled. at least my bag will smell good lol *dies*
146 2018-04-11 23:44:53 Just fixed my oil diffuser. Someone give me a mechanical engineering degree
147 2018-04-11 23:44:43 He is a businessman ..wanted to put oil price up..thats all
148 2018-04-11 23:44:36 abused his office in Ok. he gave the people's natural resources to oil while lining their pockets, who doesn't know this? OK go DEM.
149 2018-04-11 23:44:35 It was midnight when at last they arrived; the resistance convoy a luminous serpent writhing across the horizon. Tin immediately stashed his speeder behind some nearby dunes, then looked to her with eyes that shone like spilled oil.

"A storm comes, outlander. Are we ready?"
150 2018-04-11 23:44:32 I was listening to the sawbones episode on bones yesterday and, ironically, i managed to burn my wrist with oil while cooking dinner for my family today
151 2018-04-11 23:44:30 Can’t wait to keep reading it. “We are in a hidden oil and water smoothie state!” Got me thinking...
152 2018-04-11 23:44:16 My coconut oil is liquid.

That means it's finally spring again.
153 2018-04-11 23:44:05 Reality check, oil majors aren't interested in exploring NZ.
154 2018-04-11 23:43:54 ...*gets anointing oil*
155 2018-04-11 23:43:41 Damn van, leaking oil agan.
156 2018-04-11 23:43:37 Not all olive oil either. Extra virgin olive oil. Virgin peanut oil is mostly fine too. You can't deep fry in olive oil cuz it has a low smoking point.

I like using butter or ghee to cook, but I'll use EVOO as well.

158 2018-04-11 23:43:32 Now THAT was a great sortie by @jkenney on @steeletalk .   I'm with Jason, and I love our coasts.  I just don't love oil trains, gas at outrageous prices or making working stiffs poor for a radical agenda.
159 2018-04-11 23:43:15 Have you ever heard of what Venezuela was like before Chavez? Venezuela is banned from selling its own oil by the US as it cut into US/Saudi profits. That led to an economic crash and food trade with Venezuela was also sanctioned. Venezuela's economy is 70% privately owned.
160 2018-04-11 23:43:14 He now has 90% of BC votes. He is standing with British Columbians not oil puppets
161 2018-04-11 23:43:12 She is a hostage of an american oil company, her crazy tweets are a cry for help.
162 2018-04-11 23:43:11 Honestly toner, tea tree oil, and aloe lol
163 2018-04-11 23:43:09 Motive? Again I ask you, why would the UN lie and anger the biggest supplier of oil in the world?
164 2018-04-11 23:43:05 One of my clients had body pains the other day I gave her some cbd oil she was dancing by that afternoon 
165 2018-04-11 23:43:02 It's important to know when to go home and call it a day. Coming in fresh the next day is more important than burning the midnight oil and leaving later than the after-school programs/organizations
166 2018-04-11 23:42:39 I live by rosehip oil!
167 2018-04-11 23:42:36 rice done.  someone tell me to stop fuckign overusing the sesame oil.
168 2018-04-11 23:42:21 What? So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just happen to be lawyers for Cambridge Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? Wow.
169 2018-04-11 23:42:20 I pee crude oil please
170 2018-04-11 23:42:20 Because they can't explain it John. Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead.
171 2018-04-11 23:42:16 That's an excellent point. Oil companies are legally allowed to inject all kinds of toxic chemicals into our aquifers and ocean.
172 2018-04-11 23:42:16 Does anyone know how to change oil? I need my changed like TONIGHT!
173 2018-04-11 23:41:52 The eyeball at the top of the pyramid on money is actually a tiny camera!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
174 2018-04-11 23:41:47 @JimCarrey love the art -keep painting - Pruitt Head of the leaky oil pipelines that Polute  your ground water while he rakes in the big bucks - funny $50. a night for condo in DC sounds like corruption to me.  Fire Pruitt -Impeach Trump
175 2018-04-11 23:41:43 Especially since the US is in top 5 biggest exporter of oil
176 2018-04-11 23:41:43 Marula oil or rose hip seed oil! But if you want something stronger hyaluronic acid is great!
177 2018-04-11 23:41:38 Yet, when provinces like Nfld. & Lab, Manitoba and , yes, BC move to develop new hydro, the left and others protest with as much vehemence as they expend on oil. Strange logic that reads renewable good unless it isn't.
178 2018-04-11 23:41:36 I suppose oil companies were around then too, yeah? 
179 2018-04-11 23:41:32 Ah. Well stay away from that. Rosehip oil is great for skincare. I got on it earlier this year & it’s been amazing.
180 2018-04-11 23:41:24 @MakeupForWOC hello. I’d like to ask you and your followers for some suggestions. I have normal skin. I’m not dry or oil but occasionally will get a dry patch or two of my skin is irritated. Can you suggest any drugstore primers for my skin type?
181 2018-04-11 23:41:21 it makes me so mad seeing people complain about their skin but use neutrogena pink grapefruit scrub and coconut oil and call it skincare...YOU are your biggest investment. take care of your freakin skin you only get one body!!
182 2018-04-11 23:41:15 Dinner was amazing. My last cook for the week! Bacon Wrapped Turkey Breast with Bone Sucking BBQ, Baby Brussel Sprouts cooked in toasted Walnut Oil and finished with Orange Zest and fresh cut Sweet Potato Fries with Sage & Onion.
183 2018-04-11 23:41:08 Yikes, soybeans prolly the worst, I think sticking to olive is the best bet for most people since price comes into play and folks go for cheaper vegetable oil. So that's that economic factor too
184 2018-04-11 23:40:56 Haha! You are so Russian! I’ve argued with a few of you on here over the years.

Again I ask you, why would the UN lie and anger the biggest supplier of oil in the world?
185 2018-04-11 23:40:55 JT and other oil puppets must consider BC won't stay quiet if goverment is acting against its poeple wish.
186 2018-04-11 23:40:54 It was  Mustard oil that used a lead pipe to break the mp3 player
187 2018-04-11 23:40:49 I wish I had the photo from New Pro where he's dousing himself in baby oil...he worked for the community
188 2018-04-11 23:40:38 @realDonaldTrump 
The way to strike Syria is:
1.  Hit Bashar al-Assad Palace
2.  Help the Kurds take over Eastern Syria and the Oil.
3.  Strike the air defense on Mt. by Aleppo.
4.  Station 2 Air Craft Carrier Groups off Syrian Coast.  Impose No-Fly Zone.
189 2018-04-11 23:40:32 Its beer:30, time for the #Foster’s oil can train, choo choo.........
190 2018-04-11 23:40:30 I call BS. Stop bending over for oil/gas and work for your constituents.
191 2018-04-11 23:40:29 It's not *quite*accurate to say oil isn't why we're in the middle east. Long gone are the days of capturing oil fields for strategic advantage- the stability of the market is still important, even if the US production has soared. It's a globally traded commodity.
192 2018-04-11 23:40:16 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
193 2018-04-11 23:40:04 Thanks! Yes, hopefully with adult-use cannabis becoming legal later this year, Canada will allow vape oil pens as another form of administration.
194 2018-04-11 23:39:57 Use it daily and make sure you don't put lotion on yo face bc oil bring the black heads
195 2018-04-11 23:39:47 Soy oil is my particular bane. It's not an allergy, soy is a seizure trigger (unless fermented), and only sometimes, but-- not a risk I want to take! I do poorly with most legumes, I didn't realize it was a thing I could track except via trial & error.
196 2018-04-11 23:39:32 I just came up with a new conspiracy theory! P. Trump and P. Putin are putting on an act to raise oil prices so to help the Russian economy! It will be on CNN tonight! I am a genius! 
197 2018-04-11 23:39:20 I think all of America has been burning the midnight oil since August of 2016 or sooner.
198 2018-04-11 23:39:16 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as carbon taxes). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead.
199 2018-04-11 23:39:15 He is a master at manipulating markets however. Wonder how his purchase of oil stocks and Raytheon worked out over the last two days?
200 2018-04-11 23:39:13 لله درّك يا "خروع"
201 2018-04-11 23:39:05 I check this site a few times a month, and have for over a year. I do not believe the script of MSM on Syria. Trump just stated, "Missiles are coming". The script is we are attacking because of a chemical attack. I say bullshit. Petrodollars need oil.
202 2018-04-11 23:38:58 I am a lesbian person of colour who lives in Texas and works in oil and gas. I have experienced a lot of hate but also a lot of understanding.
203 2018-04-11 23:38:52 If the pipeline does not go through then we will see the oil being shipped by railcars and trucks. That would be a disaster waiting to happen.
204 2018-04-11 23:38:50 I piece of ginger about as big as your thumb. Peeled and chopped up. 
1 cup of pineapple chopped up.
4 slices of jalapeño sliced up.
2 leaves of basil julienned.
Put all this in a bowl & add 1 tbsp olive oil & salt & Pepper. Stir & let marinate for 15 minutes
205 2018-04-11 23:38:41 Is there any better story than the Andre the Giant/Randy Savage confrontation.....”NO BABY OIL...GET OUT!”
206 2018-04-11 23:38:36 @KrazyEssentials I'll be getting some of the glow oil for my sister to slay at her bday pool party. 
207 2018-04-11 23:38:07 All real cooking OG's make slight messes and get popped by oil at least twice
208 2018-04-11 23:38:02 It's more like *Continue fucking up the Middle Eastern countries for oil and power.
209 2018-04-11 23:37:26 Ohhh lavender makes me so queasy lol but I've been using oregano oil and tea tree oil a lot lately for skin rashes and internally
210 2018-04-11 23:37:25 The way to strike Syria is:
1.  Hit Bashar al-Assad Palace
2.  Help the Kurds take over Eastern Syria and the Oil.
3.  Strike the air defense on Mt. by Aleppo.
4.  Station 2 Air Craft Carrier Groups off Syrian Coast.  Impose No-Fly Zone.
211 2018-04-11 23:37:09 lemme uhhh lemme get a Tuna salad, so all the veggies is free? Ok put a couple handfulls of everything on, mine as well haha, ill do bbq sauce, oil and vingar an uhh ya some salt and pepper
212 2018-04-11 23:37:09 The CR curl maker had great definition but I couldn't go past 2 days, it would break down and get heavy. When I use MJ pillow soft curls I use the Eco Styler argan oil gel on to of it. That gives me enough hold.
213 2018-04-11 23:37:08 because of that i was finally able to get an oil change and schedule an appointment to get my car detailed too. now i can nap in peace
214 2018-04-11 23:37:06 It’s not about oil, the world is flush with oil reserves. They can drill in Texas to their hearts content with no wars. Twenty years ago wars were fought over oil,not anymore.Canada alone could supply America with all they oil they need.Qatar just announced 80 billion barrel find
215 2018-04-11 23:36:56 Premier Horgan said Tuesday that he’s concerned about any new legislation in Alberta that may have adverse consequences in his province, including increased gas prices. However has no regard for Albertans while  holding up an approved project that depresses oil prices!
216 2018-04-11 23:36:47 Rouble typically joined at the hip with crude oil so this is a major deflection
217 2018-04-11 23:36:40 Whatever you do don’t drink that horrible beet juice stuff you talk about on late night infomercials. Between guns and fake health drinks, how many ways are you going to try to hurt Americans? You’re literally a snake oil salesperson, Dana.
218 2018-04-11 23:36:39 “I miss Jessi bc she’s the light of my life but also because I don’t have anyone to oil my clippers for me.”-me 
PLEASE COME BACK.
219 2018-04-11 23:36:35 In that case you needn’t ban exploration because nobody will want to buy oil and gas.
220 2018-04-11 23:36:23 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
221 2018-04-11 23:36:13 Everybody tryna get on the Gold Standard again but the US. Money ain’t finna be worth shit in a minute you want oil? Syria like “pay me in gold”. Same thing with Russia and their resources, and China, and North Korea lol..
222 2018-04-11 23:36:10 I had enough money to buy a bag of potatoes and no money to buy oil to fry them.
They got boiled and got salt and pepper.
Still never collected a check from the government.
223 2018-04-11 23:36:07 I guess I have that vibe that my life isn’t together because an old man gave me 10 minute life advice lecture while I was waiting to get my car’s oil change.. 
224 2018-04-11 23:36:06 And the reason we saw ANY is because we decided to be the US oil/arms wars poodle and support them murdering Muslim civilians - women and children. What did we think was going to happen> No it started in the early 80s, not 2003.
225 2018-04-11 23:35:54 The most annoying thing is after buying the Aso-ebi you constantly chase after the tailor who will even charge you more for sewing! It's only in 9ja where d cost labour continously rises above cost of material!

1 day, mechanics wil charge us in pounds for oil change #onlyin9ja
226 2018-04-11 23:35:51 [He can make tea, but in an unfamiliar kitchen, he’s not a fan of multitasking. After giving a him in thanks, he spreads some oil before asking] Before I lose you again with—whatever you’re doing—anything particular you want in your omelette? Anything I shouldn’t put in it?
227 2018-04-11 23:35:39 It's amazing that it took 2 weeks of oil cleansers and scrubs to remove it. I can see why you'd like Dior LipGlow instead!
228 2018-04-11 23:35:28 Wow! Burn the midnight oil. Enjoy!

Remembering when the Wings were in the Western Conference. Shudders.
229 2018-04-11 23:35:23 Finally have oil again 
230 2018-04-11 23:34:55 Do you sell meat from animals that eat products made from palm oil eg cattle feed? It’s a tough product to elimate fully from shelves but fair play for raising awareness
231 2018-04-11 23:34:46 Just cleaned out my car, got an oil change, wash and wax, and working on getting stains removed. It was a PRETTY PRODUCTIVE DAY
232 2018-04-11 23:34:43 Is not about been smart is about fact the essence of subsidy is to take away the burden of cost of crude oil on Nigerians buying pms,and the higher d price of crude oil d more subsidy we pay dis is pure fact .So this government was ripping us off when crude was $35 and pms 145
233 2018-04-11 23:34:28 I might be wrong but Burnaby has the refinery. so yes cutting off oil would really screw up gas supplies. I am unsure of the workings of that.
234 2018-04-11 23:34:26 Watching the Finance Minister on CBC. Same lines as Trudeau, Notley, etc. It don’t know how they so fail to empathise. The real subtext is: neither the feds nor Alberta give a crap what damage happens in BC if it means losing their oil money. Such hypocrisy from the Libs.

236 2018-04-11 23:34:11 Oil,sources r still main factor in Suriye conflict, warmongering of West.The thing's Russia's on Surie side,onthe other hand Saudi,Israel,US
237 2018-04-11 23:34:09 Mom props: she used to make fresh home made pasta like, all the time. And we had fresh baked bread and olive oil with most of our meals.
Mom shade: today there was too much black pepper on her potato chips so she had to dust off each one before eating it.
238 2018-04-11 23:34:06 They prostitute themselves for the Arab oil dollar
239 2018-04-11 23:34:02 Burning the midnight oil this week but, it might just pay off come Australia fly-time and beating jet lag.
240 2018-04-11 23:34:01 @ScottRogowsky are you burning the 2 am oil to broadcast HQ from London? you know you wanna
241 2018-04-11 23:33:49 If you think NZ stopping offshore oil drilling is going to have any impact whatsoever on global climate change or oil consumption, you are deluded.

244 2018-04-11 23:33:32 Send EU it is their oil pipeline. The Blood of Biafra Jews and Christians In W Africa GENOCIDE is still flooding Britain and their jihadists. The pictures are still there, take a look.
245 2018-04-11 23:33:23 No wonder FN people eat  animal fat all year long and healthy lives, that argue with oil and fat is misplaced and confusing to many.
246 2018-04-11 23:33:20 @Jessi_Noelle will you come oil my clippers?
247 2018-04-11 23:33:17 olha eu uso o da neutrogena oil free fator 30 pra rosto e ele é perfeitinho! E minha pele é beeem oleosa

250 2018-04-11 23:33:05 "well I didn't do much to the meat except just shape it and put a little bit of that oil you made on to it and put a Rime leaf in it. That's what I saw you do once to a roast like that. I just put the Rime Leaf for some flavor so it can cook with the meat all you have to do is++
251 2018-04-11 23:32:51 Southern District of New York and @nytimes   New York has known you well for decades and it is appropriate that they may well be the office that unmasks you for the mob boss and snake oil salesman you are.  BAD
252 2018-04-11 23:32:50 Vegetable oil gives you strong bones
253 2018-04-11 23:32:39 I have to get a oil change in the morning 
254 2018-04-11 23:32:30 No Doubt! Fattiest Chickens they can find! Everything deep fried is straight to basket or bag w/o draining off the greasy oil, biscuits dry as a sand dune! Popcorn chicken? Should be sold as slingshot ammo from being so badly deep fried too long! That's a N.C. store!
255 2018-04-11 23:32:28 Happy to attract oil and gas investment to Aus if NZ doesn't want it! Then we can export them the gas to them because I can't see kiwis stopping using cars, heating and plastics!!
256 2018-04-11 23:32:03 The next government will just reverse it. Oil explorers will just have to work on new inshore for now, plenty there to be extracted yet.

Did you know AUS ADR $BHP Billiton is the largest exporter of OIL in the world ~ it supplies China, gives $DAX % & Direction 8 hours before it opens.
258 2018-04-11 23:31:51 Oil 66.85 it shot up omgQuick check motormouthTake your time really but I would fill upNext move probably upwards
259 2018-04-11 23:31:51 The point is that we will continue to need oil for decades to come and keeping our resources in the ground while importing oil from overseas hinders our economy. We are a very large and very cold country and wind, solar and battery technology can't supply us what's needed.
260 2018-04-11 23:31:48 なんか、今日始業時間に人少ない
261 2018-04-11 23:31:37 I have acne prone skin and only use Cerave cleanser and moisturizer, which really works well. I use baby oil or mineral oil to remove makeup. From what I understand, less is more when it comes to acne.
262 2018-04-11 23:31:35 What are you talking about? Everything he’s done benefits Putin. Renegotiating trade deals when the US economy is strong-start trade wars. Wanting to defund NATO and UN, pulling out of Syria, increasing oil dependency....undermine FBI
263 2018-04-11 23:31:31 Believe this or not , one pet store I was in in Brea California, was selling the CBD oil for dogs/cats to help calm them down and or for anxiety.
264 2018-04-11 23:31:28 How does not drilling for oil and gas deal with "climate change" ?
265 2018-04-11 23:31:11 @TTJMcC Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
266 2018-04-11 23:31:07 Listened to Jason Heir on Simmons’ podcasts and totally popped when I saw which wrestler sits in front of an oil painting of himself *wearing the same outfit*
267 2018-04-11 23:31:00 My brothers deathly allergic to peanuts, but the peanut oil doesn’t effect him for some reason haha
268 2018-04-11 23:30:56 Super excited for my black stretchy pants, hot tea, and my new oil pastels. Best night ever.
269 2018-04-11 23:30:53 It should be illegal for military scum to come over and do recruiting at schools. “come be apart of our greedy imperialist murder system and sacrifice yourself so we can get more oil.” Like fuck off.
270 2018-04-11 23:30:50 Wow, you really have bought the snake oil, haven't you?
271 2018-04-11 23:30:41 Try vitamin E oil, good for skin, too
272 2018-04-11 23:30:40 don’t you love it when oil splatters onto your skin and you just wanna never cook again.

275 2018-04-11 23:30:22 The champion of the regions, he who said “Offshore oil and gas drilling was an essential feature of domestic and export growth...and businesses and enterprises enabling it would get full government support” now standing by supinely as Labour/Greens stuff them

281 2018-04-11 23:29:49 Lunacy runs in that snake oil family
282 2018-04-11 23:29:48 Beard oil first, then blow dry (heat protection ftw), then beard balm to keep it all in place!
283 2018-04-11 23:29:47 Just breakfast potatoes with smoked sausage,mushrooms,and onions pan fried with a little olive oil.
284 2018-04-11 23:29:47 Let the UN in then so you can wipe the smug look of America’s face and prove them wrong. If you have nothing to hide, why do so?

Why would the UN lie and risk being cut off from your oil.
285 2018-04-11 23:29:43 I just came up with a new conspiracy theory! P. Trump and p. Putin are putting on an act to raise oil prices so to help the Russian economy! I am a genius!

288 2018-04-11 23:29:04 Cook the garlic into the oil before putting the meat/vegetables in the pan. You’re welcome
289 2018-04-11 23:28:55 Please, Beth. 

He is saying Randy Bryce supports the oil pipelines because he worked on them as a union ironworkers. That is a strawman. 

Spare me your bullshit.
290 2018-04-11 23:28:47 36.00 DD with oil between them
291 2018-04-11 23:28:40 Nice to see the corporate puppet doing the job for his corporateoil lobbying pals as usual ?
292 2018-04-11 23:28:23 Then Alberta is a horse's ass. Better not hear Notley or Kenny babling about "rule of law".
Happy to see them cut off the oil. Hurst them more than us. I believe gas is far too cheap.
293 2018-04-11 23:28:22 Yeah  I understand but we are going to be 1 of the top oil exporters shortly due to fracking so i'm not fearful at all.
294 2018-04-11 23:28:02 So Steven oil majors that bail out of Taranaki are virtue signalling on a global scale and hurting NZ or are they making a pragmatic business decision?
295 2018-04-11 23:27:53 Deep frying or just a lot of oil.
296 2018-04-11 23:27:50 VERY excited to read Hosking's sizzling hot take on the cessation of offshore oil/gas exploration. Tell me I don't have to wait too long @nzherald!
297 2018-04-11 23:27:50 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Syria had 2,500,000,000 barrels (400,000,000 m3) of petroleum reserves
298 2018-04-11 23:27:42 At this point, "green" energy can't supply anywhere near the energy we need & all use vast quantities of coal, oil & gas in their manufacture. Maybe someday in the future, we'll have a viable option but not with current technology. Nuclear is the best alternative we have so far.
299 2018-04-11 23:27:40 Trump's #1 job is to help Saudi Arabia, since they bought a lot of military equipment, to get the price of oil up to $80 a barrel.
300 2018-04-11 23:27:37 retaking the same buzzfeed quiz over and over until it finally tells you which famous movie dog you wanted it to say you were based off of your favorite essential oil
301 2018-04-11 23:27:29 also! if youre falling for that saudi prince and his whole “women can drive uwu we’re progressive like the west” schtick you’re doing exactly what he wants. its a marketing trick because oil is tanking. they’re trying to pull a united arab emirates on u lol
302 2018-04-11 23:27:13 i better not die over ingesting some fucking peanut oil, i actually can't swallow right now though fuck

308 2018-04-11 23:26:26 My faith in government restored! NZ GOVT just announced an end to all off-shore oil & gas exploration ... congratulations to @jacindaardern & team
309 2018-04-11 23:26:26 body oil is cute until you’re slipping off your chair smh
310 2018-04-11 23:26:24 olive oil and honey has done more for my hair than coconut oil ever will
311 2018-04-11 23:26:11 That's the key: fry them in lard, tallow, or even butter. The problem is vegetable oil, which gets oxidized easily and transforms into trans fat.

However, most places outside that fry that stuff will use vegetable oil cuz they're cheaper. You'd be fine making it yourself.
312 2018-04-11 23:25:59 Hey @michaelcrowel15 ,,,,go buy some NORTEL stock,,That is where oil is going
313 2018-04-11 23:25:01 Officially never attempting to fry anything again ... almost had hot oil in my eye 
314 2018-04-11 23:24:46 Remember when carcinogenic oil-based coolant from large electric mains transformers turned up as cooking oil in Belgium? That's what this is about.  But thanks to Brexit, you'll still be able to get it in the UK. Freedom!
315 2018-04-11 23:24:45 @MaupeO @seunokin @channelstv When crude oil price was $110 & pump price was N86, @MBuhari said there was no subsidy (the video is still on youtube). Crude oil price has dropped below 50% & pump price has almost doubled yet NNPC is spending N1.4trillion on subsidy. #WhoIsLying?
316 2018-04-11 23:24:29 Then tried to deliver dick for breffus to redeem himself ..  okay that's cool but I'm still olive oil ass
317 2018-04-11 23:24:21 Did bp even get in trouble for their oil spill or did we just charge that shit to the game? I cant remember
318 2018-04-11 23:24:18 And most of the FOX talking heads. FOX owned by Murdoch, who is a Genie Energy investor stealing oil from Syria's Golan Heights, occupied by Israel.
319 2018-04-11 23:24:14 The problem is that most fried food is fried in vegetable oil, not the fat by itself. Saturated fat is not the problem. The problem is refined, bleached, and deodorized vegetable oil.
320 2018-04-11 23:24:04 In a perfect world oil/gas pipelines wouldn't criss cross Canada. But Every province will benefit from this pipeline. Provinces have their hand out for revenue sharing. This is a big part of that. So stop obstruction now. @DrJacobsRad @JustinTrudeau

324 2018-04-11 23:23:39 We need a strong economy to make the expensive transition to new energy sources. Ending oil now is like kneecapping ourselves before trying to jump a hurdle.
325 2018-04-11 23:23:11 There are people with morals who don’t believe sickening Russian and Assad propaganda that claim rebels staged these chemical attack’s.

Tell me, as the biggest supplier of usable oil in the world, what would be the UN’s motive for lying and angering Russia?
326 2018-04-11 23:23:09 OEA forced that tax increase, they put the oil tax back up to 5%.

331 2018-04-11 23:22:34 Golan heights oil
332 2018-04-11 23:22:17 Is it not significant that Syria has signed over oil rights to Russia and all this malarkey kicks off? The West couldn’t give a fig about innocent people suffering from chemical injuries. Yet again it’s about oil, and yet again more innocent people get killed.
333 2018-04-11 23:22:16 I was thinking the exact same thing.
334 2018-04-11 23:22:14 Thanks! I just did a quick dry cure with some salt, seasoned liberally with the salt and pepepr, seared in a mixture of butter and oil and then threw some garlic cloves & thyme in to butter baste at the end. Have to experiment with some more flavors like yours.
335 2018-04-11 23:22:13 BC is land of British Columbians who don't want U. S. oil company to make mess in their land and waters.

348 2018-04-11 23:20:13 Oil majors aren't interested in NZ exploration because there are better opportunities elsewhere. Plus they have been divesting themselves of NZ assets and will continue to do so.
349 2018-04-11 23:20:03 @UAlberta Chancellor Doug Stollery must be immediately fired. Awarding an honorary degree to David Suzuki is unjustified. Stollery is recognizing a destroyer of Alberta's proud Oil industry that both students and parents depend on!
350 2018-04-11 23:20:00 Mr. President why are gas prices going up? Almost 50 cents since last month. I thought you released all the sactions for oil companies.

375 2018-04-11 23:16:33 Actually, BC does not receive royalties from Alberta oil. That is strictly between Alberta and the Federal government. BC does receive a pittance for having the pipeline run through it but most families income is greater... So your point is moot
376 2018-04-11 23:16:32 You can what if anything. The fact still remains that pipelines are the safest way to transport oil products. So what's the options. Shut down a billion dollar industry over what ifs and not deal with facts.

387 2018-04-11 23:15:24 Wouldn't need an oil pipe line if they stopped funding the oil companies profits and invested instead in alternative energy, oil could have been done away with years ago if the oil companies hadn't prevented it.

392 2018-04-11 23:14:51 Excuse me, frozen meals can be much cheaper than a pot of soup I fix w/o meat. A head of cauliflower $ 4.99, a pound of tomatoes $3.99, a pound of potatoes 99 cents, etc etc etc. My soup pot is a gold mine.All due 2 Oil Barons getting filthy rich. Wish it was the farmers.
393 2018-04-11 23:14:46 If we have 3rd biggest reserves of oil then a big refining investment Why not refine?
394 2018-04-11 23:14:33 Most people don’t know the importance of foreign reserve. They don’t know that without that everything will be expensive. A good example as you cited is Venezuela, where inflation is way more than 1000%, an oil rich nation for that matter!
395 2018-04-11 23:14:31 Fellas if you tryna avoid balding early or receding hairlines (and it’s not hereditary)

- get sleep

407 2018-04-11 23:13:43 As Day Seven began at #GC2018  yesterday, NZ was at fourth place on the medal tally. By the end of the day, NZ had become a world leader on taking significant #climate action. Well done Kiwis! #NZpol #Oil
408 2018-04-11 23:13:32 LMAOOO yeah I can take some coconut oil and loose glitter and make my own for like $5
409 2018-04-11 23:13:31 Yet another virtue signalling joke by Labour. Not exploring locally just means oil exploration, jobs and associated revenue will happen elsewhere in the world. Shipping more jobs and money overseas doesn't help New Zealanders.
410 2018-04-11 23:13:22 Endbridge is such a giving company.  As if the big oil spill in Kalamazoo wasn't enough, now we're getting coolant.  They need to get out of our state.
411 2018-04-11 23:13:19 Shit on Greens all you want, but when you hear: "Canada has no energy strategy when it comes to oil and gas production beyond liquidating its resources as fast as possible in the name of short-term economic growth," you should at least be concerned about FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY!

413 2018-04-11 23:13:08 When was the first time you heard of Genie Oil and Gas?
414 2018-04-11 23:12:58 Massage OIL!  @Snickerdoo2 @ray3284 @DwilightF @JohnnieBowers47
415 2018-04-11 23:12:36 ......also a handy way of grabbing the oil under the Golan Heights.
416 2018-04-11 23:12:25 @BillSimmons watched the #andrethegiant doc last night and the only wrestler who fit the description from your podcast w/ the oil painting of himself must be Pat Patterson.

Have to rewatch to look for it.
417 2018-04-11 23:12:21 Coconut oil
418 2018-04-11 23:12:19 Also, it is noted that you didn't really try to answer. If materials and energy for mfg came from somewhere else (and very obviously they do) how is this different from moving Canadian oil?
419 2018-04-11 23:12:13 We aren’t naive, we know transition will take time but must happen. Many even feel it would be better for Alberta to refine and then ship oil. Most importantly there are First Nations against this and if we are really going to do anything about UNDRIP, they must be respected.
420 2018-04-11 23:12:11 I don't see how the game has fundamentally changed. Oil and gas were already on the decline in the region. Plans were already being made.
421 2018-04-11 23:12:11 Companies have to care about more than making money. Companies and governments have to take into consideration how their decisions will affect the lives of other people, not just the oil companies. Companies should exhibit Corporate Social Responsibility, at all times.
422 2018-04-11 23:12:06 Well, the incumbent government signed a new oil deal with EXXONMOBIL. How is that working out?

425 2018-04-11 23:11:50 PM: Coconut oil followed by mild cleanser & some kind of magic cloth. Neutrogena Hydro boost, burning retinol stuff that costs a shit-ton (Dr. Denis Gross). Cerave night cream that's suddenly hard to find. Waiting on Retin A from Mexico cause it's approx $150 up here.
426 2018-04-11 23:11:43 It's not a pointless exercise - it still has a point, even if you don't agree with what the point is. Also it's important to understand that people can promote the benefit of the income of oil and gas, and believe that climate change exists. The doesn't make you a denier.
427 2018-04-11 23:11:27 This coconut oil face mask feels perfect
428 2018-04-11 23:11:26 Under YOUR’leadership’, you’ve gotten rid of the regulations that help keep our air clean and our water pure!

429 2018-04-11 23:11:24 So.... Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company?

438 2018-04-11 23:10:34 If helps thinking, over the 30+ years of (UK) oil, stolen from Scotland, Treasury was being swelled by sums circa £11bn pa.
Enormous! Around a third of entire SCT annual budget.
439 2018-04-11 23:10:32 Can we just refine the stupid oil in Alberta and sell it internally so our petrol prices go down already?
440 2018-04-11 23:10:31 Ronald, what u are missing, the big players will stop buying oil stocks, There is no long future.  Think NORTEL

446 2018-04-11 23:10:13 Norway was one of the poorest countries in Europe country until the 1970's when oil was discovered. Since then it has become rich because of having a huge income from oil with a relatively tiny population. They've also invested wisely since then.
447 2018-04-11 23:10:13 If you see me hanging with such babe in same dress what do you expect if I see clear road
448 2018-04-11 23:10:04 Yes, but it is changing. They are being responsible with the oil revenue...well more responsible than Nigeria! They are building infrastructure that should benefit everyone. It is a work in progress and I am very optimistic.
449 2018-04-11 23:10:02 I was just watching ICE and how different would it have been if it was a Mythology episode with Black Oil instead of the parasite?

452 2018-04-11 23:09:34 But you work in the NZ oil & gas industry, I think your opinion may well be biased.
453 2018-04-11 23:09:28 Hummm THIS seems suspicious...wow
So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? No wonder he's losing his composure!
454 2018-04-11 23:09:21 FREE PRO TIP: you can make ~80 percent of all veggies delicious by adding some combination of salt/pepper/oil/garlic/onion and roasting it in the oven. (Brussel sprouts, asparagus, sweet potato, potato, carrot, all offhand)

458 2018-04-11 23:08:57 The future is Nationalized around the world..Do not put oil and gas together,,,Gas has a future, for now
459 2018-04-11 23:08:55 Gummint announcement on Oil and gas. Sounds like gas has limited lifespan so at some point there will be a conversion to electric.

461 2018-04-11 23:08:51 Norway sovereign wealth fund grew last year by MORE than the entire Scottish Government Budget.
Norway has extracted LESS oil than Scotland.
Norway also has its own currency. 
Whatever Blair suggests do the opposite. #NeverTrustARedTory

463 2018-04-11 23:08:46 why does my skin react to coconut oil if I use it too many days in a row

skin, stop it, it's good for you
464 2018-04-11 23:08:42 Money should not be a factor in matters of life and death. There are people who are in favor of the death penalty because they think it saves tax payer money. In a different conflict, the money argument could be used to support war. For instance, if oil is involved.

466 2018-04-11 23:08:36 I need more oil for my pen 
467 2018-04-11 23:08:16 Once again, you’ve got the wrong coast. The left coast is for Asia not for refining. The gulf coast is for NA and also for export. Also, we’re not talking just about provincial money but also federal money which I’m certain people will object to as “subsidizing big oil”
468 2018-04-11 23:08:10 He must have a team of stylists and mechanics to oil his joints and upgrade his circuits though right?

480 2018-04-11 23:07:03 Last I checked the US oil and gas industry is NOT nationalized and it is becoming the dominant player in the market, certainly as it affects Canada

535 2018-04-11 23:01:33 The article is superficially interesting but fails to understand the new economy. Norway is a major oil producer what is almost 96% renewable energy for itself, as one example
536 2018-04-11 23:01:33 Bear in mind, (not sure if pun intended or not) that Putin would love to get his hands on the massive oil and natural gas reserves in the Golan Heights, which would help his free-falling economy. He can't keep up Syria, Ukraine, and Kalingrad indefinitely.
537 2018-04-11 23:01:27 Zero, shoot, clean, and forget. Again, if you wanted to make sure you were ready for anything you had to take personal initiative & money to train on your own. The only exception was chemical warfare. We trained seemingly every 2 weeks on that.

549 2018-04-11 22:59:59 Russia supports Assad, wants to maintain its hegemony & oil contracts; America seeks regime change in order to extend its hegemony and secure access to Syrian oil. See Iraq? See Libya? See Syria.
550 2018-04-11 22:59:58 Guys, I think Olbas Oil might actually be a legal high
551 2018-04-11 22:59:38 Big difference with natural gas,,,Alberta Tar Sands is DIRTY OIL,,25 yrs ago we were told the end is near,,Buying NOR TEL STOCK IS WHERE IT GOES,FOLKS

553 2018-04-11 22:59:27 KM intends 2 use Suezmax tankers that r Three times larger than  Aframax tankers in Burrard Inlet. (Exxon oil spill was 1/3 the size of Aframax capacity+ still damage decades later.)  Google: "The Cost of an Oil Spill in Burrard Inlet: $40 Billion...For Starters Rex Weyler  2012
554 2018-04-11 22:59:06 Didn't see anything about climate deniers ... Reality is though, oil consumption will increase globally beyond 2040.
555 2018-04-11 22:59:03 It’s funny ‘cause he’s drinking heavily polluted river water contaminated with PCBs, lead, & oil drilling runoff
556 2018-04-11 22:59:02 hey @RachelNotley & @JustinTrudeau who makes more $$$ off #KinderMorgan pipeline selling #tarsand crude oil #Texas or #Alberta?

We're in the money , Thanks Mrs May all our donations have paid dividends  .oil price up Hedge funds dream come true , AGAIN
558 2018-04-11 22:58:47 No! No! No! No Regime Change forced by hands of American Forces! Absolutely Intolerable! Saudi Arabia Step UP! It must be another country to pluck Assad! Turkey, Russia, Iran R  triplets providing cover 4 Assad in Name Of OIL! Oil=Power=Domination N the Area=2 EXPAND! Wake Up!
559 2018-04-11 22:58:26 Might want to watch oil go up and gold, then sink hard after the screaming and yelling dissipates
560 2018-04-11 22:58:24 Correct change for people who can't count? Why bother?
561 2018-04-11 22:58:21 And the good coconut oil.
562 2018-04-11 22:58:04 Ya that is nice. Lots of oil in the south and two patches of uranium in the north!
563 2018-04-11 22:58:00 Olive oil make you boobs grow?
564 2018-04-11 22:57:53 BC only wants to control the amount of oil sent though the pipe line and to prevent any spills. So quit wining about poor Alberta and grow up.
565 2018-04-11 22:57:51 Do Norway have their own corporations drilling for oil three or do they bargain really hard against the multinational companies that want to harvest their reserves?
566 2018-04-11 22:57:51 It’s about optics
567 2018-04-11 22:57:50 Perhaps Senator Cruz & Graham had something to do with that. The owe an apology to Diamond & Silk too. Facebook will be broken into three or four companies in a few years anyway, a la Standard Oil & AT&T.
568 2018-04-11 22:57:43 I started adding MCT oil to coffee since it helps put your body into fat burning mode. Plus it makes me feel good since it's a healthy fat that gives energy.
569 2018-04-11 22:57:37 Lmaoooooo olive oil??? Yea imma step my chest up now
570 2018-04-11 22:57:28 Gonna shine so bright even US will wanna invade my face for oil resources

575 2018-04-11 22:56:41 Lower gas prices. 4% of crude oil and petroleum products are shipped annually by truck. If the associated costs of logistics decrease, that should hypothetically reduce the overall price.
576 2018-04-11 22:56:40 They’ll be installing a Banana Republic in Syria who will rubber stamp the approval of an oil pipeline.
577 2018-04-11 22:56:36 Lmao get some olive oil and start massaging them thangs and hit some chest workouts, thank me later 
578 2018-04-11 22:56:32 good choices! Wish legal oil pens were available in Canada for our patients...
579 2018-04-11 22:56:31 Yes, eliminating sugar and exercising should help bring them down. Some studies show that fish oil and garlic help too. Glad everything else was good!
580 2018-04-11 22:56:30 We are talking about oil & gas exploration.  Be honest and use expkoration employment figures.
581 2018-04-11 22:56:04 It's always about oil. Lives are cheap.
582 2018-04-11 22:55:56 the eucalyptus I got is just a fragrence oil and isn't really strong. feels somehow sweet too. maybe his gonna be good mixed with camphor
583 2018-04-11 22:55:54 Finna see what this bio oil about
584 2018-04-11 22:55:52 gas and oil may have a lot more to do with it than we know.
585 2018-04-11 22:55:41 Coconut oil is everything
586 2018-04-11 22:55:38 Exactly: May & Trump etc have no morals whatsoever;so how can they claim high moral ground? Their greed won't be satisfied until they plunder Syria of its oil & risk a terrible conflict with other super powers.This is a very serious risky business &we are led by dangerous clowns!

589 2018-04-11 22:55:31 U.S. now has oil.  On the verge of being a major oil exporter.
590 2018-04-11 22:55:27 We export the vast majority of our oil and import it from the Middle East / Asia anyway don't we?
591 2018-04-11 22:55:27 Oil and gas is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an Emissions Trading Scheme, like we have in NZ). 
SUPPLY-SIDE interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it. No emission reductions!
592 2018-04-11 22:55:21 speaking of business your girl needs an oil change soon lmaoooo
593 2018-04-11 22:55:18 It’s funny you say that while sitting in a heated house, or vehicle. Oil and gas are here for a while buddy.

598 2018-04-11 22:54:36 We are talking about exploring for oil and gas that we cannot use if we want to try and keep climate change to <2 degrees.  ACT response is based on either denying climate change or a desire to promote pointless exercises.

603 2018-04-11 22:54:10 Saudi = petrodollar which the $£ are based on, that is why so much lies are been pushed at russia. Russia is worlds biggest producer of oil, now Russia started to sell some in chinese currency. When iraq wanted to sell in euro, uk n usa killed over 1/2million.
604 2018-04-11 22:54:03 Any of these jobs in the oil and gas industry?

617 2018-04-11 22:53:03 We cannot proceed to an election with the current electoral committee we have. They have rigged election after election. Stop buying oil from us and the regime will tumble.

621 2018-04-11 22:52:23 It had to happen sometime. The choice is now, or when the oil runs out / after we've wrecked the planet. (Taranaki has been hit by a couple of bit storms recently, maybe a bit of joining the dots wouldn't go amiss?)
622 2018-04-11 22:52:21 you created the problems in my country, Libya, and you left them to thieves who steal their money and oil. I am from the South of Libya. We have no electricity, no gasoline for cars, even though we are an oil country, killing everywhere and there is no normal life

630 2018-04-11 22:51:57 This is more that we paid for gas about 8 years ago when oil was $150 a barrel.  This high price can be blamed solely on government.  This is not driven by the oil and gas market, but the tax and steal market.

641 2018-04-11 22:50:32 This reminds me of a joke.  Penguin drives to a mechanic and tells him the car is burning a lot of oil.  Mechanic says it'll be a couple of hours so the penguin comes back a few hours later.

"You blew a seal."

Penguin blushes, wipes his mouth.  "No, it's just ice cream."

659 2018-04-11 22:49:01 I think it says a lot about Saudi military strength, that their army can't even defeat a bunch of rebels in a tiny country like Yemen, even after 3 years. Meanwhile their prince is buying villas in France using Hajj and oil money, and their people are too lazy to care.
660 2018-04-11 22:49:00 Hasn't benefited from thc oil. Yes the buzz can freak you a bit, but ONLY if you dose wrong.

687 2018-04-11 22:45:51 I must state that I too think @theJagmeetSingh is being a weak leader on increasing oil tankers and pipelines in B.C.
688 2018-04-11 22:45:23 Hmmmm.  Did the government invest in the building of the transcontinental railroad? the TransCanada Highway? the oil and gas industry. No brainer!
689 2018-04-11 22:45:15 This is premature - first end fossil fuel  demand and then its extraction will drop otherwise we are simply offshoring oil exploration to the third world  where environmental controls are not there. Think about it- you are grandstanding and not being responsible.

691 2018-04-11 22:44:57 Thank you to all the greedy oil CEO’s and their minions plus NDP/Liberal carbon taxes
692 2018-04-11 22:44:52 The grief and stress I've had trying to source a decent bit of oil whilst going through chemo itself has been enough to drive a sane, healthy
 person mad. Yet, it's been worth it as the benefits of me taking the oil are outrageous. I'm still yet to meet another patient who..
693 2018-04-11 22:44:32 Black Garlic Oil is a game changer — tell us when we can try! 
694 2018-04-11 22:44:32 I use Doterra Breathe oil blend. :)
695 2018-04-11 22:44:12 Simple, but managed to put motor oil, washer fluid & anti-freeze in my car all by myself this time. I remembered how  S/o to my dad! He’s so clutch lol. Next up: Learn to change a tire. 
696 2018-04-11 22:44:08 I used CBD oil and no problems now 
697 2018-04-11 22:44:06 Lol I use the same stuff!!! my vap oil ,rso. Wax and flower!!
698 2018-04-11 22:44:05 Everyone is saying use oil and make up wipes but DONT if they are lash extensions. Take a clean makeup brush and kinda dust off your lashes, if any liquid use witch hazel

700 2018-04-11 22:43:46 Prefer you curb enthusiasm for oil chemists and begin to consider what US military  Dr Joseph Hibbeln and other brain researchers are trying to tell food chemists about omega 6 to 3 ratio and edible oils in modern diet  and impact on developing brain.

703 2018-04-11 22:43:31 $8300 per violation to an oil company wow bet that really makes them think twice next time!
704 2018-04-11 22:43:29 Ah but there is ‘oil’ in them seas around those rocks ;)
705 2018-04-11 22:43:14 If you care about energy development and Canada, you sure spend a lot of time talking only about oil and Alberta. Don't think you aren't transparent...
706 2018-04-11 22:43:13 Q tips with eirher makeup remover or some type of facial oil. Becareful with your lashes love
707 2018-04-11 22:42:36 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you created the problems in my country, Libya, and you left them to thieves who steal their money and oil. I am from the South of Libya. We have no electricity, no gasoline for cars, even though we are an oil country, killing everywhere
708 2018-04-11 22:42:35 We can either continue to be part of the problem and find more and more oil to burn or we can become part of the solution and decide to leave it in the earth.
709 2018-04-11 22:42:31 Banged up my finger pretty bad changing my cars oil. Lord don’t let me lose my finger, just take me instead lmao
710 2018-04-11 22:42:29 You may be right. Alberta restricting the flow of oil to B.C. would be a tit-for-tat action and would make more sense than the feds killing BC infrastructure projects, Imo.
711 2018-04-11 22:42:24 No oil based products on lash extensions

720 2018-04-11 22:41:46 Put oil on a cotton pad and it’ll come straight off. Obviously use a makeup wipe / wash ur face after
721 2018-04-11 22:41:41 Use baby oil and then wash with water
722 2018-04-11 22:41:35 I believe you have Russia confused with the west. UK US an France want to break up Syria an claim pieces for them selves. US wants the south. UK an France will split the north. Oil an pipes is what it's all about.

731 2018-04-11 22:40:06 Investments in infrastructure and green tech pay for themselves in improved productivity and reduction of negative externalities associated with fossil fuels—which is why they’re investments. Canada has more industries than just oil. We’re a rich nation.
732 2018-04-11 22:39:57 Trump HURTS Russia :
- Stronger military
- Crippling sanctions
- Armed Ukraine
- Export US oil/gas to Europe
- Bombed Assad 2X

Obama HELPED Russia :
- Let them invade Crimea
- Uranium One deal
- "Flexibility after the election"
- Cancelled NATO missile deal
- Against US oil/gas
733 2018-04-11 22:39:54 It's an oil from a plant that is helping her!! There's plenty of other things to worry about! 
734 2018-04-11 22:39:53 Rising oil prices good for Putin War good for donnie to deflect from his Russia troubles. I can’t help but think this is too convenient Putin allowed Assad to do it  #PutinsPuppet #Mercenaries $$$ to be made
735 2018-04-11 22:39:50 AOCS is an association of oil chemists not saviours of the free world.Less hyperbole and less faith in an EPA that relies on pesticide industry data. Sending  more research links to concerns raised by Neuroinflammatory seed oils by US researchers and pediatricians most helpful.
736 2018-04-11 22:39:42 If so... it should never be in the “Exit Interview” format because maybe Chia asks all the players about the Big Picture. Making a special point that a meaningful meeting will have to take place with McD would go a long way. Let’s hope that Chia makes many phone calls to McD

740 2018-04-11 22:39:28 The first response of big oil is to sue. They tried to sue Burnaby after the pipeline was breached by their contractor. #BCTOO
741 2018-04-11 22:39:23 Fake ballooned crude oil prices will bring inflations. Only winners will be investments firms that charge thousands $$$$  per year to small investors. All is stacked and rigged against regular citizens. Even under Trump. Trump is a very rich part of their scheme.

754 2018-04-11 22:37:19 Hi, no more pipelines. No more oil. No more.
755 2018-04-11 22:37:14 The active 31 oil gas exploitation permits and 22 offshore permits are protected which will run until 2030 at least. No-one will lose their jobs and there is enough time to allow effective transition. Please don't spread moral panics on this. It's untrue and unethical.
756 2018-04-11 22:37:08 After two cycles of voting , it’s great to see an end to oil exploration. We now raise our eyes into the energy of the stars (and super volcanoes !) .  @jamespeshaw @NZGreens
757 2018-04-11 22:37:08 @PhillyD The only reason the US and other European countries claim he does is to have a reason to finally crack down on the Syrian gov, bring troops in, and finally secure a route for oil and gas, as well as control over the Middle East. How do we know so? Iraq. (Pt3)

766 2018-04-11 22:36:27 Olive oil
767 2018-04-11 22:36:13 I doubt that. Truth be told I have no idea what gets asked at the exit interviews, but presumably the captain / franchise player gets asked about the Big Picture
768 2018-04-11 22:36:01 The US growing tired of their crap in China and them bombing our ship in 1937 leading us to finally cutting their oil supply is us pushing them to attack us?

770 2018-04-11 22:35:57 Thank the lord for beard oil
771 2018-04-11 22:35:54 Also: the active 31 oil gas exploitation permits and 22 offshore permits are protected which will run until 2030 at least. No-one will lose their jobs and there is enough time to allow effective transition. Please don't spread moral panics on this. It's untrue and unethical.

773 2018-04-11 22:35:21 Many tourism jobs are minimum wage, not so oil&gas.

774 2018-04-11 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil

776 2018-04-11 22:34:42 I have been wanting to make an essential oil pouch for a while, so today I did!  Wondering if I should put these in my Etsy shop? I think my oil drawer is getting too full.  I used a pattern by @sewhungryhippie but I did change it a touch.
777 2018-04-11 22:34:32 Where do they sell pure CBD oil???
778 2018-04-11 22:34:31 Going after Syria and Iran are just too take over oil and for the greater ISRAEL project.  So sick of the bolshevicks DESTROYING EVERYTHING!
779 2018-04-11 22:34:16 Get that kid on tumeric and c b d oil quick!!!
780 2018-04-11 22:34:12 Maybe Iran and Syria want to own their oil, Russia wants easy cheap access to it, and the rest want to steal it. Iran, Syria and Russia did not destroy Iraq. Also I didn't see Iran etc in Korea, Vietnam or Iran and Syria in Afgahnistan.
781 2018-04-11 22:34:06 There certainly is a reason for it. Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. Arms sales to Taliban, Iran and Syria and probably Hezbollah.  And aggression on us. But they didn’t mean to set up the goof Trump but hurt Hillary. Oil cybercrime and weapons. Why help them with THAT economy?
782 2018-04-11 22:34:05 Dam they need to change the oil
783 2018-04-11 22:33:57 And yet, it will cost us billions more, when the oil spills and waters run red with carcinogenic chemicals, because you stripped the teeth out of the EPA to actually Protect he Environment (and We the People), allowing corporations to pollute and not pay to clean up heir own mess
784 2018-04-11 22:33:51 But the Saudis are the ones who took that Indian oil deal out from under Iran. This sqeezes the mullahs to death. The regional players aren't against the Iranian people. I think Iran will be helped to recover once the regime is gone.
785 2018-04-11 22:33:48 That’s a shame if it was just a “have a nice summer”

787 2018-04-11 22:33:38 That's a GREAT idea!!  Instead of sitting on their duffs picking their noses they can HELP somebody AND improve business.  Will have to get a 2nd person to run the register.  I can't wait till I fill mine up - I'll ask them to check my oil, too
788 2018-04-11 22:33:37 I just made donuts and only got splashed with oil twice #winning
789 2018-04-11 22:33:27 Hey @michaelcrowel15 ,,,go buy Norte stock,,,that is where oil is going
790 2018-04-11 22:33:04 Trump told her loud n clear if u want ur share in OIL ۔ U hv to Join US . & She gracefully replied Yes Sir.
791 2018-04-11 22:32:57 Don't Bother, by the time you get to the gas pump OIL INDUSTRY would have raised and profit from this convenient fine, Drive Electric cars!.
792 2018-04-11 22:32:53 Last time I went there  they messed my oil change and didn't warranty it  mapleview is much better
793 2018-04-11 22:32:49 My Honda used at least one quart of oil every week! I would never buy another.
794 2018-04-11 22:32:46 @congress every conservative better oil big person pants on and start calling out libs force them to defend their positions and socialist idea stop supporting fake conservatives push for term limits Americans for term limits Article 5 convention power back to states
795 2018-04-11 22:32:45 20 to 30 years is a very long way away, that is why the likes of saudi that is still sucking its dregs of oil realise that now it wants land, it wants to be bigger, it wants syria & Yemen. It wants both usa & uk to get these countries for it. Uk usa will kill innocence for saudi.
796 2018-04-11 22:32:44 yes, distinction between "meeting" & "meaningful discussion on subject X"
797 2018-04-11 22:32:39 ねむい
798 2018-04-11 22:32:30 So all the  big nose Arabs that look like a camel's back are sitting around smoking hashish, giggling about the take-down of Iran & Syria... At Last, they see the rich oil fields of Syria & Iran pumping millions for Free... Not so fast girly butt... Two can play this game... War?
799 2018-04-11 22:32:16 After paying u guys for the land and developing it with oil money when u guys can't bost of any major resources, u guys are insulting us about land invasion. Are u guys normal at all?
800 2018-04-11 22:32:11 this is all false flag stuff to get us into a never ending war with russia and to allow a syria invasion so we can lay down an oil pipeline through syria for saudia arabia. its all stupid.
801 2018-04-11 22:32:03 Bathing in coconut oil to keep this tan glowing
802 2018-04-11 22:31:58 Thanks @AldiUK, The point that @IcelandFoods are making with their #PalmOilAlarmCall is that despite all efforts to move to 'sustainable' sourcing, the palm oil industry remains linked to major issues, such as deforestation, loss of habitat, climate change …
803 2018-04-11 22:31:42 This shows RYANS Voting and you can see the War in Iraq will not end UNTIL Trump confiscates the oil as he always said.
804 2018-04-11 22:31:41 Exit interview is not what I expect. A meaningful conversation about the direction of the franchise
805 2018-04-11 22:31:26 Coconut oil xo
806 2018-04-11 22:31:17 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead. No net reduction in global emissions whatsoever.
807 2018-04-11 22:31:17 Am i the only one who will oil down and just get stuck sitting there naked ? This coconut oil got me smelling so good  Iont even want no clothes on 
808 2018-04-11 22:31:16 I spent 8 weeks. Got in trouble. Make change? Pphhhtttt. Plastic, baby. And don't get me started on roughing it. A full size in basic? Gtfo, not even queen size like the Navy?
809 2018-04-11 22:31:14 michael tracey did this shit too, probably worse - in his article endorsing voting-abstention he soft-balled trump's blood-gargling "we should've taken the oil" "kill the whole family" rhetoric and hoped that trump could turn out to be a moderate rockefeller republican 
810 2018-04-11 22:31:12 I am so sad i wasn’t born in the era of pocket watches, love letters, traveling by steam trains, reading by oil lamps and listening to music on a gramophone.
811 2018-04-11 22:31:06 "in the province" the oil sands arent in the province of BC so BC can't regulate them. Even Alberta can't turn off oil to BC without turning off oil to the rest of canada.
812 2018-04-11 22:31:02 Why do I have to pay $25 to take vitamin E, Fish Oil and Biotin.
813 2018-04-11 22:31:01 To repurpose an historically misquoted quote, that I hope you’ll see the connection Chris;

I use CBD oil with a small dose of Ultram daily. And because my pain is managed I no longer have depression and anxiety is under control.
815 2018-04-11 22:30:48 ArtHAX: Going out after painting but forgot to do ur face? Oil paint is the same as makeup just mix what u want and smack that baby on! No eyeshadow? No lipstick? No concealer? No problem!
816 2018-04-11 22:30:46 Can you oil companys, hedge fund, bankers and oligarchs not settle this on the golf course. Stableford competition so if anyone has a night mare on any hole then no biggy. 

Cheers.
817 2018-04-11 22:30:36 On the bright side, the oil reserves which are no longer about to be exploited will either be proven not to be needed, or appreciate significantly in value as other, global, sources dry up.

825 2018-04-11 22:29:56 Koch's have been Ryan's biggest supporter for years. Koch's got their tax breaks, and less pollution Regulations through, while Trump's crimes distracted people. Pruitt banned EPA Funded scientists from being on committees. Ryan's been a busy boy for big oil.

828 2018-04-11 22:29:37 Why do you anti oil folks continually inflate your views with pictures like this? It doesn’t lend any credence to your views by misrepresenting the facts.

You do realize that the tankers are limited to Afrimax size, which is about 1/3 - 1/4 the size of that super tanker?
829 2018-04-11 22:29:34 i remember buying her some oils and stuff too! like that argan oil bottles, they are tiny and they sell them at target for like 5 bucks. i bought her some growing hair think there too. i hope it helps :( if you can, try taking things that will help with keeping calm and stuff

835 2018-04-11 22:28:55 what kind of oil tho
836 2018-04-11 22:28:53 It is not a coincidence that US sanctions are aimed at major #oil producing countries #Russia, #Venezuela and #Iran that are enemies. Also protests against Canadian pipelines held in USA. US wants high #WTI prices also, just like #OPEC. US trade deficit already bad.
837 2018-04-11 22:28:52 those are two very strong oil reducers lol ~dryness can also make you break out, so drinking water, moisturizing, and adding face masks with aloe, tea tree oil, cucumber, or coconut into your routine can help balance the pH in your skin
838 2018-04-11 22:28:45 Do you think WWE has a budget just for baby oil?
839 2018-04-11 22:28:02 Writing is on the wall for oil. It might have been our biggest export in 2012, but it won't be in 2050. Pretending this won't happen exposes us to shocks when it does. Finally we hve a govt making considered plans to prepare for the future, not sticking their heads in the sand.

858 2018-04-11 22:26:25 todays annoucement doesn't reduce demand for oil.  You need to double or triple the price.  Green MPs will still fly business class on oil-powered-planes to Green conferences in Germany, and travel on brown-coal powered trains.  And East Cape residents will still drive around.
859 2018-04-11 22:26:25 Good question. DOJ should look at Facebook thru the lens of Sherman Anti Trust laws. Amazon for sure, much more anti competitive than Standard Oil

874 2018-04-11 22:24:59 An oil change should should not take two hours.... and I’m stuck watch Jerry Springer on their stupid TV.  #pissedoff
875 2018-04-11 22:24:53 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to weaken NZ economy and means someone else will produce it instead. Bad deal!!
876 2018-04-11 22:24:46 Europe's economy is in stagnation, unemployment is rising. USA - China relation, USA - Russia escalation, Iran and UK serious involvement. Even Bahrain found oil in the worst possible time, when you look at geopolitics. Poor innocent, they will go down first...

882 2018-04-11 22:24:24 Don’t use coconut oil on your lashes or face! It’s super comedogenic and will clog your pores! If you’re going to use an oil use sunflower or jojoba. I use Clinique take the day off balm and it works just as good as oil and moisturizes the skin
883 2018-04-11 22:24:23 Do you remember that Business Week praised Warren Buffet's purchase of Burlington Rail.?  One way or another oil is being transported if not by pipeline then by rail. Why no outcry about rail safety? Could it be anti-pipeline activists = Buffet's puppets?

885 2018-04-11 22:24:04 video of the difference when she was given the oil. It was amazing & heartbreaking. Our stupid legislature would rather she lose all function than risk getting 'hooked' on something that doesn't even get her high! Even if it did, it was saving her life! Idiots!

891 2018-04-11 22:22:39 Only supplements I recommend are Vit D, krill oil and Centrum multivitamin. Also take Resveratrol which is in wine that helps prevent heart disease. Krill oil better for you than fish oil.

Those same firms that collude to rigged the stock market charges thousands $ per year to small investors=bad evil
898 2018-04-11 22:21:37 When I did my Master's on accountability in deep-sea petroleum exploration in 2014, Labour's policy supported more exploration but with tighter regulation. The announcement not to issue new exploration permits shows how far they've come and how far the sun has set on oil and gas.
899 2018-04-11 22:21:24 Truth is no one will notice, it’s like Oregon saying it’s only going to import oil.  A publicity stunt that does nothing other than childishly show off.  Fossil fuels made us wealthier and healthier in aggregate. The Armageddon complex of the Green movement is ludicrous.

906 2018-04-11 22:20:48 Well now this is comical. Of course a pharmacy lobbyist is creating pricing policy for this admin.  I guess they figure the corporate needs of this industry are the same as Big oil, big banks, his insurance, and all the rest. Just another “screwing” against the American people.
907 2018-04-11 22:20:45 but you are helping Putin's wallet.  with all the bluster, oil stocks up - Putin's cash cow is his oil stocks.

915 2018-04-11 22:20:22 #CPPP - More policy announcements off the top of my head. The CPPP will grant oil & exploration permits to any one. The fees will be used to end child poverty.
916 2018-04-11 22:20:22 Why do I misunderstand? Because I don't agree with you? How condescending, Bot. We will still fine oil is valuable and Alberta is innovative. American domestic use out strips their own supply which is why they import. Most of the money is leaving Canada anyway.
917 2018-04-11 22:20:06 Yup get the wealthier ,wealthier, give big business fantastic tax break,and give yourselves a really good tax break, take healthcare away while you have great paid for benefits,and gift the people’s land to big oil so yah you guys did push you agenda

937 2018-04-11 22:18:14 Okay thanks brother ...Thanks
938 2018-04-11 22:18:10 It would cost them too, if they don't make the fuel sales to B.C. It's probably just a way for the oil companies to take advantage.

941 2018-04-11 22:17:47 yeah, it's just so different from the metrics we have. but they employ HockeyData, and we know they're not snake oil salesmen, so I'm intrigued.

960 2018-04-11 22:15:53 hello! professional oil guy here. depends on what you're trying to accomplish -- rosehip is generally fine for keeping the skin's elasticity. (for any scarring/post-breakout, marula or tamanu are better)

962 2018-04-11 22:15:48 The usual Liberal and Trudeau bashing on #pnpcbc .There is more to governing than catering to Jason Kenney's temper tantrums. It's not all about Big Oil.
963 2018-04-11 22:15:47 That’s what I think too. But, someone from church was saying how she needed to talk to her Bishop when she changed her anti depressants, stopped taking narcotics and started using CBD oil, as suggested by her MD I’m like....I think thats fine though...?
964 2018-04-11 22:15:39 Pick whatever you want to use oil or not

966 2018-04-11 22:15:36 If only the industry would support its workers by not laying them off to protect shareholders after they caused the price of oil to crash by over producing.

If only the industry would support our province by paying fair taxes and royalties.

Oil production is at record highs
967 2018-04-11 22:15:31 Anyone need a oil change HMU for the low
968 2018-04-11 22:15:29 @BBCNews So May and Co are following Trumpton into another illegal war after months of media propaganda aimed at Russia (and has got nothing at all to do with gas pipes and oil!). Our media and the BBC are complicit in the lies and should hang their corrupt heads in shame.
969 2018-04-11 22:15:28 New Zealand government says will not issue new oil, gas exploration permits
970 2018-04-11 22:15:26 Mr. President, you created the problems in my country, Libya, and you left them to thieves who steal their money and oil. I am from the South of Libya. We have no electricity, no gasoline for cars, even though we are an oil country, killing everywhere and there is no normal life.

973 2018-04-11 22:15:13 Aim High, Shoot Low, Dress Like A Bus Driver... 3 of your 4 weeks in tassled loafer camp are spent learning to make correct change for your passengers... Survival training is only having $500/day to spend on food/hotels... that sort of thing?
974 2018-04-11 22:15:07 This is not true. Congress has given up this right to determine war in any country where there are traces of ISIS. This is why they find ISIS in so many countries with oil and pipelines.
975 2018-04-11 22:15:04 So I guess @jacindaardern and her CoL government will be turning down all invites to travel overseas and will stop flying domestically, because oil.
976 2018-04-11 22:15:01 All about gold oil & the petroyuan as I’ve said
977 2018-04-11 22:14:54 Morally a clear conflict of interest. But at present, morality and politics are like oil and water. #auspol
978 2018-04-11 22:14:53 Over the  that Iceland have decided to remove Palm Oil from their products, now consumers need to understand the problems and stop buying other products that contain Palm Oil
979 2018-04-11 22:14:37 Russia has a lot to gain by going to war...it can literally fuel its economy with oil revenues.
980 2018-04-11 22:14:36 thats a noble goal and I believe it.  Tell me if I'm wrong, but todays NZ Govt announcement, doesn't reduce the demand for oil, it increases the price, its just taxing poor people more.
981 2018-04-11 22:14:32 I filled Luxaar's Skell with oil
982 2018-04-11 22:14:32 Cos they have oil

985 2018-04-11 22:14:17 offt there telling us in Aberdeen Oil is running out...oh wait is that because Indy is looming.....
986 2018-04-11 22:14:16 Gosh, the oil industry has known it's going to happen since the election, how many years do they need? 
987 2018-04-11 22:14:13 my dumbass got oil scars on my stomach from getting popped by the oil while trying to make eggs with my shirt off lol
988 2018-04-11 22:13:59 Not speaking in defense of the proposed pipeline through BC, but where is the source for this map? I grew up in Alberta and my father worked in the oil & gas industry and from what I'm aware of this seems exaggerated at best.
989 2018-04-11 22:13:48 How am I? I'm saying that they should be selling free range eggs only as well as not selling palm oil??
I'm not sour at all, its good there getting rid of palm oil I'm fed up that they can boast about it but can't be bothered to do something as simple as not sell caged hen eggs!

991 2018-04-11 22:13:43 You know why you don’t go Marshals alone? You end up leaving with an exfoliating back brush, castor oil pomade and Nike mid high socks... this is also why you got to Marshals alone.
992 2018-04-11 22:13:32 A government that owns a majority stake in an airline, that literally couldn’t operate without oil, thinks ending oil exploration will “save the world”. NZ’s nuclear free status did nothing to end the Cold War, I’m sure this will have a similar effect on oil extraction globally
993 2018-04-11 22:13:27 It is such a nice alternative to coconut oil or lube for a shiny, wet look! I WANT IT ON MAH BODY!
994 2018-04-11 22:13:26 oil is a volatile market and industry that had led to several economic downturns in Alberta history. The part I don't understand: knowing the volatility of this industry, why do you insist upon a structure specifically for it's export? Alberta, you deserve better. #nopipeline 2/3
995 2018-04-11 22:13:05 @JustinTrudeau @ElizabethMay @cathmckenna @CBCNews  PM will you & your ministers each declare what stock they own in oil companies?
Will liberals promise to pick up the tab cleaning up any and all leaks of any pipelines?

998 2018-04-11 22:12:42 .@jurpelai: External shocks like the oil crises and nuclear crises provided a window of opportunity for renewables and for experimental energy policy. #CGEPevents
999 2018-04-11 22:12:30 They're finally putting medical marijaunna on the ballot here in November. They won't even allow cannabis oil, despite the fact that it will not make you high. There are families who've been fighting for it for autistic kids & those w/seizure disorders. I'll bet Oregon is ok w/it

1007 2018-04-11 22:12:15 I voted against Scott Pruitt for EPA Administrator because I knew he would put special interests & big oil corporations ahead of our environment, clean air and safe water.
1008 2018-04-11 22:12:13 Reading Bruce’s article, he states that McLellan looks like he’s solid but not the assistants. If Chia fires the assistants, and McLellan decides that’s okay with him and stays what does that say about McLellan? Would a player want to play for this kind of coach?

1010 2018-04-11 22:11:57 Very subtle great crunchy crust taste the olive oil and sauce and cheese. Not dry like NY cardboard lol. Not chewy. Mmmmm
1011 2018-04-11 22:11:53 Made homemade salad dressing, and it’s gooooood. Olive oil, lemon, apple cider vinegar, agave, salt & pepper. Just played around with the ingredients until I liked the taste. Not big on recipes. 
1012 2018-04-11 22:11:39 Ali must not remember that 10 years ago oil was $140 a barrel and just a few months back it was lucky to get 50 bucks a barrel. tens of thousands have lost their jobs in this industry yet you celebrate how sick is that.
1013 2018-04-11 22:11:35 Identity change came when oil barrel price went up, since tar sands production costs are expensive: it's very recent. And AB still stuck with the same problem it always had: no access to sea, for exports. Maybe Harper could explain why he didn't build AB's pipelines, in 10 y.
1014 2018-04-11 22:11:33 The objective is never to beat anybody its to keep perpetual war going to make the corperations money and steal resources Iraq its oil Afghanistan its the opium poppy refined into heroin US troops gautd poppy fields

1018 2018-04-11 22:11:18 PEP & Messi are meant for each other and they need to be reunited at city.
And I would happily see the world ranting about city/oil money/ etc all the stuff.
Coz after that, they could not imagine what they would be going thru on the field.
1019 2018-04-11 22:11:09 An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.

Putin manages an economy the size of that of Italy.  Middle east unrest suits him as it drives up oil price.  In the 1980s Thatcher/Reagan devised a strategy that collapsed the Russian empire.
1020 2018-04-11 22:11:01 So May and Co are following Trumpton into another illegal war after months of media propaganda aimed at Russia (and has got nothing at all to do with gas pipes and oil!). Our media and the BBC are complicit in the lies and should hang their corrupt heads in shame.

1023 2018-04-11 22:10:55 I love Shea products; my hair stays moisturized because of it and I love the smell. They have oil treatments I use in my hair too and it’s good for curling and when you use a blow dryer
1024 2018-04-11 22:10:53 Japan has a machine that can take plastic and make oil. Why can't Canada or US get a few. It takes all kinds of plastic.
1025 2018-04-11 22:10:53 Wow me afeité con coconut oil y fue un desastre pero que suavecita!!!!!
1026 2018-04-11 22:10:47 This oily life is trash!

But the general rule is exfoliate, clean, and moisturize. The gag is most time of you have extra oily skin, then you need to put oil on it because your body is over-producing it because it lacks it.
1027 2018-04-11 22:10:34 The Sunni vs Shia conflict in the middle east will eventually grow to involve iran. If the west sides with the Sunni countries for their oil and Russia helps Iran we will have a 3rd world war because Muhammads grandson was ambushed by his uncle. Lit.

1032 2018-04-11 22:10:28 Kinder Morgan is probably thrilled, they get cheap oil to sell at higher rates, and Canada’s govt is thinking of paying them to build the infrastructure they need to do it.  Fools running our country.

1057 2018-04-11 22:07:40 Ironic that the greenies and oil industry haters will all become oil in a few million years as their sad sorry ass corpses decompose and revert to carbon. I hope aliens use that oil in their composting toilets.

1065 2018-04-11 22:06:56 At this point "doing action" is required. Investors (not just oil related) need to see action, or they will take their investment elsewhere. There goes Canadians economy down the toilet... have you seen people lose their home cause they can't afford bills?
1066 2018-04-11 22:06:48 thank you for looking into alternatives to Palmoil. 
Palmoil is a nasty & unhealthy oil. Rape much better & makes great chips too

1072 2018-04-11 22:06:08 But, what happened to the Heritage trust Fund? That didn't go anywhere except Alberta's coffers and that's the one that should have been used to start the diversification of Alberta's economy away from the oil industry. But, methinks everyone loved the oil money - too much!

1078 2018-04-11 22:05:29 People are going to think that we're soo messed up .  People if you're trying to grow your eyebrows use castor oil.  My friend here is proof that it works. Just apply it carefully, don't pull a fathima .
1079 2018-04-11 22:05:26 Add that to the state's primary economic reliance on high oil prices, and subsequent financial difficulties as of late, and it's difficult for them to justify any budget increases. /END
1080 2018-04-11 22:05:24 Let me get this straight.    @Bill_Morneau version of 'risk' is the risk a delay poses to the Texas oil corp, not the risk to the BC coast, our environment or our climate.

At least he's honest.   #pnpcbc
1081 2018-04-11 22:05:24 Iran has a hate Israel problem, and needs to negotiate. West wants to weaken Iran via syria to protect oil interests and to please Israelis. Nuclear Israel has no moral right to preach. Supporting Jihadis for regime change in secular Syria will lead to one more civil war.

This nonsense about investors being turned off is such nonsense.  The big investors are already getting out of the oil sands.  There are lots of opportunities in conventional oil and gas.

Vitamin C I've heard good things about. Which brand are you using? I forgot that I have lemon essential oil so will finish that 1st.

1088 2018-04-11 22:04:28 If the USA wanted Muslim genocide, all Muslims would already be dead. The USA wants an oil pipeline from Qutar to Europe for Iraq's stolen oil, nothing more.
Islams radicals should think about that deeply, before they provoke the act you fear.
1089 2018-04-11 22:04:02 I love that so many companies are doing good things eg Iceland cutting Palm oil, @TheBodyShopUK campaigning for a ban on animal testing. We still have SUCH a long way to go. Fingers crossed by the time my children are my age things will have changed.

1091 2018-04-11 22:03:51 I love having my people from the country .. I just got my driver mirror out back on, brakes looked at, oil changed, and my light fixed. Allat for a 6 pack of bud light 
1092 2018-04-11 22:03:37 He’s consistent on the things that matter to his supporters. He’s not a polished politician like Obama (snake oil salesman) and he’s unpredictable at times and I like that. It makes you crazy. Fair enough.
1093 2018-04-11 22:03:27 No. Randy Bryce was a union ironworker. Please get the facts right. Bernie Sanders visited him at work in 2016 because Bryce supported him 110% and Sanders supported the people 110%. 

All JDems oppose the pipelines and big oil companies. You are implying @IronStache is pro oil..
1094 2018-04-11 22:03:26 This government is out to destroy the pillars of our economy and it’s shameful. Oil exports from NZ are critical in continuing econ growth!!

1102 2018-04-11 22:02:22 I've actually heard about this, and seen it in a few coffee shops. It's called "bullet proof"

Supposedly you add coconut oil and butter to the coffee, and it helps you feel a bit more full, plus the coconut oil is good for you? I still think it sounds nasty,

1105 2018-04-11 22:02:12 Someone told me today that Russia is poking at us because they want to destabilize the middle East (I know right?!) even more, so they can again sell their oil and gas to Europe or China at higher prices that will support their do nothing (else) economy.  

Are we getting punked?
1106 2018-04-11 22:02:11 I’ll let ya in on a lil something...I put money drawing oil on the bottom of my feet everyday...so that I always walk towards money and abundance
1107 2018-04-11 22:02:10 today has been such a good day. I got out of bed. I presented my speech about Umbridge that I worked hard on. I washed my car, filled my tyres and got an oil change. Baked cookies, washed all my tumblers, “cleaned” my room and now I have a candle lit while I do homework.
1108 2018-04-11 22:02:08 Seeker of truth... start seeking more. Netanyahu wants an oil pipeline. Assad denies. Magic - Israel suddenly has a reason to get rid of him. Logic? Don't bow to the bankers and other greedy power mongers.

1118 2018-04-11 22:00:51 I don’t pretend to have any answers at all but it’s unfortunate that corporations and government is creating a wedge between people. Also we should listen to both AB oil industry and the people of BC. Balance and respect in some way, are there alternatives? I don’t know

1129 2018-04-11 21:59:56 I think so, yes. Because NZ could allow extraction of oil and gas while still pursuing corn and sea water.
1130 2018-04-11 21:59:49 Does SM have a daily hair moisturizer that is part of the coconut line aside from the jar of coconut oil. I'm looking for a milk or smoothie for daily use.
1131 2018-04-11 21:59:42 Relax. Read Sun Tsu. Check the value of the Ruble and the trading prices of Russian Corps. Check the value of the Syrian Pound. Compare to USD. Oil is indexed in USD (petrodollar system). Who backs Putin in Russia? When will the Truman SF arrive? $$$ = Leverage.
1132 2018-04-11 21:59:41 @PnPCBC  has there been any consideration to refining the oil more in order to reduce environmental impact in the event there IS a coastal spill.  the very heavy nature of the oil is always cited as a big concern in the evevt of a spill
1133 2018-04-11 21:59:37 I have no problem paying more for petrol, and I continue to wear oil based products incl clothing like raincoats.  Maybe I'm stupid, but how does putting a new NZ "tax", on petrol save the planet?

1142 2018-04-11 21:58:14 Cannot believe (this insanely overrated) #FentyBeauty body glow oil costs more than NARS' one (around for years) which is criticised as being an overpriced scented oil - which is true. They're virtually the same product. Same greasy consistency, look on skin and scented.

1150 2018-04-11 21:57:26 eat pray oil
1151 2018-04-11 21:57:11 yes. Eg if the total petro-needs of the planet will be unchanged, the oil and gas will simply have to come from elsewhere, and the effect on the planet, including climate change will be non-existent?
1152 2018-04-11 21:57:09 NZ to be net-zero emissions by 2050, 100% renewable electricity grid by 2035. Transition starts now with no new off-shore oil exploration.
1153 2018-04-11 21:57:08 Would loved to have, but we all knew saddam had oil and no wmds. U sort of wrecked it after that. Hope we get off at a better path. 

Ps remember indians fought for the crown, americans fought against it.
1154 2018-04-11 21:57:06 You conflate the Taliban and the Mujahideen, two very different beasts. Not much oil in Afghanistan when I was there. You’re not very goood at this, are you?

1160 2018-04-11 21:56:32 @petenajarian re xom at same price as oil at 28, what about at same price when oil was 93 and eps was 73% higher?

1166 2018-04-11 21:55:51 I agree to an extent. You have to use the land that has already been cleared. We have to stop the demand to clear rainforest at least. By using certified 'sustainable' Palm Oil then we can help this. There are no easy/obvious solutions.

1179 2018-04-11 21:54:04 I think we've gone over this territory before, but I will never forget the frothy rage of Albertans when it came to the oil industry and perceived slights by governments, environmentalists, and Indigenous peoples. I was never able to have an actual discussion in 18 years there.
1180 2018-04-11 21:53:57 Jim Rogers is there mate. He has a habit of being very right or very wrong. Considering Scottish oil revenues have been in the low hundreds of millions of $ lately that’s a negligible percentage of U.K. balance of trade. So reality completely contradicts him, pal.
1181 2018-04-11 21:53:49 Syria tensions making Putin, Rosneft, and Gazprom rich ... as long as oil price continues to be quoted in $USD.
1182 2018-04-11 21:53:37 We're banning oil & gas? Great that must mean we're going green and building a nuclear power plant? Oh we're not, so what are we doing? We don't know yet?
1183 2018-04-11 21:53:16 I’m not sure we (as a province) are in any position to spend any money( if we are to believe our Government). Having said that, the KEY to our (successful financial)future lies in Tourism, not oil or hydroelectricity. This would be a great step in that direction.
1184 2018-04-11 21:53:14 I need an oil change, car inspection and my property taxes are due this month. Help,
1185 2018-04-11 21:53:14 The list of trash piles needing pick up in Memphis is a long one. It's a case of squeaky wheel gets the oil. Miss Patricia Rogers, who I interviewed for the blight story, simply did not give up. She email blasted every city leader. Proud of her!
1186 2018-04-11 21:53:12 Your column made me wonder: Does Govt announcement include gas? Or just oil?
1187 2018-04-11 21:53:11 I’m sure he would say he’s standing bravely for Canadian taxpayers. I would disagree as CTF consistently opposes tax cuts to Canadians if it means costs to oil companies. And MB NDP has been touting CTF in recent days. Not sure if it’s ignorance or cynicism.
1188 2018-04-11 21:52:46 The oil drunk province next to us is threatening to cut off our gas supplies if we don't build a pipeline through a major metropolitan area. It's moments like this where I wish we'd invested in solar and fuel cells way heavier.
1189 2018-04-11 21:52:39 無慈悲だろーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
1190 2018-04-11 21:52:32 At least get your facts straight if you want to enter the discussion. Kinder Morgan if 77% Canadian owned; there is national interest in providing jobs for Canadians while reducing the carbon footprint and there is BC interest in using oil from the pipeline

1210 2018-04-11 21:50:53 I understand what you are saying, and the harvest time of palm oil is very quick. But you can't level rain forests and be sustainable and when the demand is so high there is not enough space to keep producing palm oil plantations sustainably.
1211 2018-04-11 21:50:47 Short term ‘bump’. Those are massive increases. And that doesn’t include the books, movies, rebuilding, oil seizures, that go on for longer than 12 months, and the list goes on. Crawl back in it.

Just don't force our soldiers to die for American oil.
1216 2018-04-11 21:50:16 Some down there will be saying Chinese Hoax till the water is up to their lips. 
That is the oil refining center of the US.
It would be funny were it not so tragic for so many living there.
As gas prices increase, electric cars, wind & solar look better.
1217 2018-04-11 21:50:02 DT is a BS showman and little more, snake oil salesman of the social media era. It’s an odd compliment, probably the only one I’ve ever made about him. Obviously this is distraction with the volume turned up to 11 from other matters involving Putin and Russia and DT.
1218 2018-04-11 21:49:47 @realDonaldTrump  Great Job, Oil is at a 3 year high! This will help your base!!!! NOT!
1219 2018-04-11 21:49:40 Pipelines, my views;

1.  Our society is oil based for fuels and will be for decades
2.  Alberta and Saskatchewan have considerable oil reserves and both provinces are landlocked.

1221 2018-04-11 21:49:25 Oil change and inspection done but lord why does my oil have to be so much 
1222 2018-04-11 21:49:24 #pnpcbc
Ask Kinder Morgan ( a Colorado company ) if instead they will build a conventional oil and gas pipeline ( not bitumen ) going east.

1225 2018-04-11 21:49:06 This is just desperate garbage to stop #indyref2. This is the same kind of unionist “logic” as after independence Shetland could become independent and take all the oil
1226 2018-04-11 21:49:03 The various Conservative Parties around Canada are too busy lining up for oil company money to be able to make me believe that they ever asked questions about what their opposition is actually upset about in building this pipeline. #TransMountainPipeline
1227 2018-04-11 21:48:56 It's coffee with ghee and mct oil
1228 2018-04-11 21:48:40 This is why you do oil changes yourself. Less money and no hassle from mechanics trying to scam money out of you.
1229 2018-04-11 21:48:27 On the one hand it is a red line for the President. On the other it's not going to solve anything except to prove to Putin he has a long ways to go in the arms race. Sell our oil & gas to Europe (that will hurt Putin more).
1230 2018-04-11 21:48:26 @chigrl Tracy, have u had a chance to study the impact of "war" news on Oil prices as to how long the so called spike lasts and if they mark turning points in trends? I do realize that news based spikes don't last long but with oil being a global commodity, is it any different?
1231 2018-04-11 21:48:22 $uso..Go back and look at my "Crazy Ideas for 2018"..One was oil going to at least 80.
1232 2018-04-11 21:48:20 Con el verso de preservar las fuentes de trabajo, la "justicia" le levantó la quiebra a OIL Combustibles..

Entonces, para q mierda tanto quilombo?

1236 2018-04-11 21:48:04 I spilled tea tree oil on my carpet and I swear that smell is never coming out 
1237 2018-04-11 21:47:57 You are #hypocrites - you decry the use of oil, but use it all day long...cars, planes, plastics...I don't see any of you giving that up. Yes - I voted for you. Last time for me. Let's all buy oil from Saudi and support their human rights values...yeesh! Are you kidding?
1238 2018-04-11 21:47:57 No moral high ground but I bet oil and money is involved
1239 2018-04-11 21:47:31 Does that mean Big oil, etc quits getting their checks?
1240 2018-04-11 21:47:29 Saudi Arabia is calling for $80 per barrel oil.  Watch for $100 oil before the Saudi Aramco stock offering.
1241 2018-04-11 21:47:26 Win May canola down A$2.63/t & EU rape down A$1.99. Support from lower A$ vs C$ & euro. Canadians planning a record 24 mill ac crop, up 4.4% on last yr. Veg oil markets weaker & specs unwinding long positions.
1242 2018-04-11 21:47:17 They better fuck off then the oil pricks

1245 2018-04-11 21:46:45 Feeling like a boss for successfully locating a garage this morn outside of hull to top up the oil in my car 
1246 2018-04-11 21:46:41 ...and what's the betting that the BBC will announce the Institute of Economic Affairs as an independent think tank when it is actually funded by Republicans, Earhart, Tobacco, Oil & US health companies, amongst others.
1247 2018-04-11 21:46:34 If you want to pull oil out of the ground efficiently, you’d do it in Saudi Arabia not Alberta (obviously there are other social issues there, but the fact that their oil is infinitely easier to get is not in question)
1248 2018-04-11 21:46:32 ベルセルクとりたいよーーーーーーIVジョブとりたい…………うわーーん
1249 2018-04-11 21:46:25 Haha... Sounds painful. Best rub some neck oil in that 
1250 2018-04-11 21:46:06 The war in Syria is all about the oil pipes through Syria. The US and British media have been told by their respective governments to not talk about the oil pipes. There is no coverage of the Iran to Mediterranean oil pipe.
1251 2018-04-11 21:46:03 Its about Oil Money and Geo political influence
Just waiting now for China to weigh in.
POTUS is pushing back on all fronts as its influence and power are being tested .
Waiting for the psychotic EU lame ducks to add their always ridiculous opinion
1252 2018-04-11 21:46:02 Back to the question, has BC ever received royalties from Alberta oil?
1253 2018-04-11 21:45:59 About the same as that blue dress had to do with a shady AR real estate deal.
1254 2018-04-11 21:45:53 America-Our country is trying to bag another oil country & tap into their life blood. Like Libya,Iraq, US is ready to topple Syria & Lebanon in one shot. Trouble is Syria has some some serious backers... Lebanon needs a few A-500s serie Anti-Aircraft Defend it's own airspace...
1255 2018-04-11 21:45:51 Putting bio oil or any dewy product as a primer works amazing for me
1256 2018-04-11 21:45:48 so my #BPL units closed at $37.92 down a tad while #WTI and #Brent #oil at 3 year highs.  Wassup w that?

1270 2018-04-11 21:44:40 Likely staged. Sad Sunni rebel terrorists use kids as shields. Sad too Arab backed terrorism gets away with it again. Arabs/Saudi going to tax Americans to take Syria for Saudi wants its oil, means America is irredeemably corrupt.
1271 2018-04-11 21:44:31 @POTUS You do realize that this is all because Saudi Arabia wants Syria. The  oil supply in the Middle East has been steadily declining since the late  1970s. Saudi Arabia wanted to build a pipeline through Syria into the  Crimea and Assad refused. Wake up people. Followthemoney
1272 2018-04-11 21:44:31 Please write a letter to the NDP/Green’s and ask them to refuse all transfer payments from Alberta and please do not take any money from the oil and gas sector of northern BC. Then let’s talk about tax increases that will happen. NDP also said NO SITE C. How’s that going??

1276 2018-04-11 21:44:19 Brent Oil looks bullish.
1277 2018-04-11 21:44:17 ExxonMobil just became a part owner of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, This means ExxonMobil and the USA need to to destroy Syria to block the Iran to Mediterranean oil pipe.
1278 2018-04-11 21:44:00 In general I’m not a big fan of Big Oil as an investment & if I did actually put $$ in it I’d probably go with one of the smaller, nimbler companies like Diamondback Energy (FANG)
or Marathon Oil. However, my vote has to be Buy - Pete has a good batting avrg
1279 2018-04-11 21:43:50 It’s upon us in face of oil crisis. Well fortunate for some.
1280 2018-04-11 21:43:43 @AlanDersh   A long and to this point distinguished career.  What made you decide to throw your lot and life's reputation in with a snake oil salesman who is probably a criminal, and maybe a traitor?

1286 2018-04-11 21:43:21 Don't stand Canola Oil
1287 2018-04-11 21:43:17 What is the spurious claim, please? Oil and gas are forecast to continue to make up around half the world’s energy needs by 2040. Natural gas demand is expected to grow 45% by 2040 (IEA). So demand-sideE interventions will reduce emissions, bans just shift production overseas.
1288 2018-04-11 21:43:05 Alright so I figured I’d go lay out for a bit soak up some sun by the pool, can’t forget to lather myself up with some tanning oil... walk to the pool “CLOSED DUE TO MAINTENANCE” I’m one greased up oily bitch rn wtfff?!?!
1289 2018-04-11 21:43:04 Meara: This quote from your review “. “In each two days of 2009,” Vollmann points out, “the world burned the entire oil output of 1990.” Is clearly grossly incorrect. World oil consumption has risen by 50% 1980 till now. If he believes what he says he is wrong.
1290 2018-04-11 21:43:02 #pnpcbc
The question is... Canada's CO2 budget is 300 megatons. Notley wants 100 megatons for the sands.  That is for a bunch of mostly foreign oil companies. The math won't work.
1291 2018-04-11 21:42:56 BTW, was frozen today trying to figure out which individual oil play to enter. (Generally trade $erx, $ery).   Went with your $MRO call.  Thank you!
1292 2018-04-11 21:42:41 Think about the bigger picture 

Oil Prices
1293 2018-04-11 21:42:39 @elonmusk Autonomy leads to higher car utilisation. This leads to tyres being worn out quicker and thus more tyres needed. Car tyres are mainly synthetic rubber made from oil byproducts. Thus oil demand doesn't drop... I may have overlooked something here...Thoughts?
1294 2018-04-11 21:42:07 May will get involved and air strikes will happen again I’ve read someone tweets and they said it’s about oil again which is probably true
1295 2018-04-11 21:42:03 It's the fusion of local bustle, folks catching up over coffee, espresso dripping, milk steaming and of course the oil popping of the #frittery.  #iheartwaterdown
1296 2018-04-11 21:42:02 Just stop... now you're off the reservation.  He lies EVERYDAY AND GETS CAUGHT DOING IT EVERYDAY.  I Can give you dozens of examples but I have to go now. Joke you think he is honest.  He is a used car salesman.
1297 2018-04-11 21:41:56 Erdogan in Turkey came to power because of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline which has now been running for 25 years. His whole family is in the oil transportation business. He is helping destroy Syria so Iran can not build an Iran to Mediterranean oil pipe.

1323 2018-04-11 21:39:51 Quick question!

If I go to a dibia and he gives me a portion for protection how exactly is that ‘fetish’?

How is it different from your anointing oil and holy water for protection. The ones you get from churches and mosques??

Could it be an extension of religious intolerance??
1324 2018-04-11 21:39:47 I just got laughed out of Adam’s dads house for showing up to get my oil changed with only a quart of oil. Apparently I needed 5...and a filter. Who knew?
1325 2018-04-11 21:39:36 Just to weigh in, KFC uses a kind of frying oil made from GMOs, its fries several times more than normal oil. So imagine the hidden danger that we are subjecting ourselves to. Not worth ukugada kabili.
1326 2018-04-11 21:39:33 I've know since I was a child the Vatican want to blow up offshore oil rigs. It's real!
1327 2018-04-11 21:39:28 With respect Neale, this cannot make any difference in global oil production because global demand and global supply sets production. What is not made here will be made elsewhere. So citing climate change benefits cannot be more than wishful thinking, even in principle.

1342 2018-04-11 21:37:35 It would be possible to meet our current 2030 NDC without ending new oil drilling. It will not be possible to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping warming well below 2C or to 1.5C without bold calls to #EndOil.
1343 2018-04-11 21:37:34 I worked extra hard to oil paint that in the middle, got a 70% grade in my art class for it
1344 2018-04-11 21:37:33 That’s just because u don’t like him.. I could have said the same for Obama, he was a whole different kind of animal. Destroyed the country by trying to make it a free for all.
1345 2018-04-11 21:37:32 La justicia no denegó el pedido de quiebra de la AFIP a Oil Combustibles solo aplicó el art. 48 y sstes de la ley 24.522 la puta que los parió periodistas del orto, estudien e informen bien!
1346 2018-04-11 21:37:32 U have caused this not Russia. U r leading our women and children out to be killed. U want oil just admit it. It's all about the oil
1347 2018-04-11 21:37:27 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part orange juice and 1 part fruit puree. Add basil and honey to taste.
1348 2018-04-11 21:37:23 help? Recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining and in situ processes result in 3–9 and 9–16 g CO2eq/MJ bitumen, respectively; upgrading emissions are an additional 6–17 g CO2eq/MJ synthetic crude oil (SCO) (all results are on a HHV basis
1349 2018-04-11 21:37:13 like Harold clurman said “The truth is like castor oil. It's difficult to take and hard to swallow, so we get them to laugh and while their mouths are open, we pour a little in." I think j cole talks about this too in an early interview
1350 2018-04-11 21:37:08 On-track pass for the lead, excluding pit stops, mechanical failures, running out of fuel, off-course excursions, hitting the wall, etc... Slipping in oil, bump-and-runs, or wheel-to-wheel contact I count if nobody spins out or loses control.
1351 2018-04-11 21:37:05 Perhaps its time
For us to say
That those with power
Just go away.
We do not want 
To win a war
Or support more killing
And what for?
For oil and gas
And global control
Despotic  leaders
Who have no soul.
Because of national interest
We protect our own
And sod the rest.
1352 2018-04-11 21:37:05 We go to war with countries that supply Russia and China with Oil.
Simple as that
1353 2018-04-11 21:37:00 it's irrelevant to the discussion because the US military does not give a shit about human rights for Syrians, they give a shit about a 3 billion dollar oil industry in Syria. If a country conducts itself improperly by international standards does it waive rights of autonomy?
1354 2018-04-11 21:36:59 
1355 2018-04-11 21:36:58 #KinderMorgan #Pipelines #TrudeauMustGo #Alberta the PM and Alberta Premier Notley are failing Albertans and Canadians in this fight to get Oil to the ports will hurt all segments of Canada. Prices are rising to points when the economy takes a dive it wont be pretty!
1356 2018-04-11 21:36:56 I don't know jack about oil, but I like Pete.
1357 2018-04-11 21:36:52 I don’t understand people who can spend $300 on makeup products but the complain about $68 being too much for a cleansing oil.

1358 2018-04-11 21:36:49 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.
1359 2018-04-11 21:36:47 Should of sent Evening Primrose Oil 
1360 2018-04-11 21:36:29 I'm finally changing my oil. Never again Am I going so long.

1362 2018-04-11 21:36:23 It's a bloody joke. The only country in the world to discover oil & become poorer.
1363 2018-04-11 21:36:22 Yeah...in the end its OIL MONEY dt buys MORALITY of west and its esteemed institutions. But lets forget wts happening in yemen kashmir and palestine and enjoy the donation first or arrange a dance party, dts UN for u folks
1364 2018-04-11 21:36:02 O sea que... ¿van a rescatar OIL con mis impuestos?
Paren que me quiero bajar.
1365 2018-04-11 21:35:51 FYI for any arthritis pain sufferers out there. Frankincense essential oil is a miracle for pain.
1366 2018-04-11 21:35:48 Or what if the game is just an oil tycoon simm when you try to take over the oil business and occasionally Echo terrorists blow up your property?
1367 2018-04-11 21:35:45 I've sen a couple of things that I mildly think are ok.  But that is NOT the point.  Even good Republican POTUS's, I don't agree much of their agenda... that doesn't mean that I want them Impeached.  Trump is a whole different animal.
1368 2018-04-11 21:35:36 I got so many coupons for Midas . I need to go get a oil change .
1369 2018-04-11 21:35:28 To me, it's sort of if the Democrats found some Texas oil guy who'd been perfectly at home in our politics for 40 years and nominated him as the new LBJ. I'd be pretty surprised if that worked out.
1370 2018-04-11 21:35:24 คือไม่ได้น่ากลัวขนาดนั้น แต่ตื่นมาแล้วปวดหัวสุด
1371 2018-04-11 21:35:21 It’s pretty sticky i have this body shimmering oil that I got from ulta a while back & it’s definitely better IMO. & it’s cheaper
1372 2018-04-11 21:35:09 I also got an oil change today SMALL WORLD
1373 2018-04-11 21:35:04 Ice baths, kratom and cbd oil
1374 2018-04-11 21:35:01 Once Syria is destroyed Iran will not be able to build a oil pipe to the Mediterranean sea. This is way Saudi Arabia is paying billions to the west to now destroy Syria.
1375 2018-04-11 21:35:00 Psalm 23:5
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows. #PrepareTheWay
1376 2018-04-11 21:34:59 Problem with this oil announcement is ppl just think of cars, Oil is used to make other things like plastic, our roads need tar-seal. Just feels rather short-sighted to me
1377 2018-04-11 21:34:56 A purifying facial mask, pastel yellow, with dandelion, jojoba oil, and exfoliating crushed bay leaf. The jar it comes in is wooden.
1378 2018-04-11 21:34:40 I was generally under the impression that sea based oil exploration wasn't going to be economically viable for the next 10-20 years due to the much lower costs of shale. Am I terribly wrong or is everyone just making a fuss over something that wasn't really going to happen anyway
1379 2018-04-11 21:34:39 If Jacinda wants to spend tax payers money she would be better off supporting domestic solar panel installation, or subsidizing solar buyback rates for power companies . Before we turn off oil, green technologies need to ready to take over.
1380 2018-04-11 21:34:38 Our only interests in the Middle East is oil, there is nothing else there. Saudi Arabia has protected terrorists and their training camps but do we attack them. We all shout about human rights injustices in Saudi again do we attack them No. Why? Oil
1381 2018-04-11 21:34:33 Why Syria must be wiped off the map? Power and money.  Turkey dreams to restore Ottoman Empire. Investors lose money for unfinished gas pipeline from ME to #Europe. France and Great Britain want oil fields, US does not want Russia in the Middle East, Someone will take revenge.
1382 2018-04-11 21:34:28 And Cohen was, until Monday, a partner of law offices, who just happen to be lawyers for Cambridge Analytica and main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company. In other words, the FBI hit a motherlode. And they did so by outsmarting the conspiracy theorists.

1384 2018-04-11 21:34:24 Thank God for green smoothies and coconut oil, otherwise, I'd look like a leather purse w/ all this caffeine I'm drinking.
1385 2018-04-11 21:34:13 It's NOT fake news, Assad is killing the rebels in his country. The chemicals were supplied by Iran who bought them from Germany. Israel took the opportunity to bomb Iran's drone factory near the border. Russia and Iran want the oil.  US went in and scared Russian and Assad away.
1386 2018-04-11 21:33:53 Jiffy Lube said you can get your oil changed and receive a complimentary jar of peanut butter, contrary to popular belief.
1387 2018-04-11 21:33:49 Russia already have oil and money, how about letting the people in Syria and rest of Middle East keep their lives?
1388 2018-04-11 21:33:45 Ask Putin to just give the Koch Bros. their Caspian Sea oil fields. Stealing the Caspian has been at the center of US strategic military positioning in the region for 40 years.  The only obstacles left now to make Big Oil’s wet dream real are Iran and Russia.
1389 2018-04-11 21:33:44 Lavender oil is the shit! I didn’t use it for a week and my face lost it glow legit
1390 2018-04-11 21:33:44 Isn't that the west? (I grew up in Martin County, seemed west to me.)

MN: $54,043
SDak: $48,281. 
NoDak: $54,643

ND shot up in 2012-14, since slid. "...up from the ground came a bubbling crude. Oil, that is. Black gold. Texas tea."
1391 2018-04-11 21:33:34 Have our country not learned any lessons from past mistakes? There is clearly a hidden agenda again involving oil or gas, or possibly both. Wars are rarely, if ever caused or about civilians, big business & banks will profit.
1392 2018-04-11 21:33:33 Ok, all you #cooks out there: Salt or Oil in boiling water for pasta?
1393 2018-04-11 21:33:32 We are often asked if CannaSmack will get you high... no, our lip balms are 100% THC Free and only use Hemp Seed Oil.

1398 2018-04-11 21:33:09 Pearl harbor biggest scam on earth BESIDES 9/11. We were cutting off oil to Japan economically destroying that country. We were provoking them just like we do every country.

1400 2018-04-11 21:33:02 my dad's best joke from when i was younger is when we would go to the store, he would say "we need to buy popeye's girlfriend" and for YEARS i didn't know that he meant olive oil
1401 2018-04-11 21:32:56 Wats a warm massage did he use like hot oil or was his hands warm 
1402 2018-04-11 21:32:45 @Stranahan the guy u had on about the war in Syria is crazy we are not going after the oil We are not going after regeim change that was hillary clinton. And Barack Obama.

1406 2018-04-11 21:32:35 We don't have oil! Not yet 
1407 2018-04-11 21:32:26 Can’t be slick to a can of oil!!!
1408 2018-04-11 21:32:25 Oh u r talking about cannabis oil.  No hav not had the pleasure yet as MMJ is not quite legal yet here in PA but supposedly the dispensaries r to open next week.  Of course that’s after l pay $250.00 2 the state & $400.00 4 classes  l shld get college credits 4 that amount!
1409 2018-04-11 21:32:18 What way of life?  Perhaps you would like to go "back to the future" and relive 2008 over and over? Did you know Iraq was a war for oil and we now have the largest Embassy, bigger than Vatican City, in Baghdad? + on + on. The right is wrong.
1410 2018-04-11 21:32:18 Chantal , why is there no analog between west to east  oil and gas pipelines and electrical energy transfer from east to west ..

is it the direction which makes the difference ?
1411 2018-04-11 21:32:16 Unknowingly picked up a leaking bottle of cooking oil at the store and got it on my shirt and jeans 
1412 2018-04-11 21:32:15 It’s about oil. The rest is just smoke and mirrors.
1413 2018-04-11 21:32:08 since the first iteration of Facebook at University it has been built on harvesting data using manipulated or misrepresented consent. Company can't change and must be broken up. Yesterday was oil industry mindset questioning electron transfer in solar panels, hopless.
1414 2018-04-11 21:32:07 I like cooked broccoli, and don't mind it raw with ranch or bleu cheese. But roasted or grilled broccoli is just the best. With a little olive oil and salt and pepper, I'll eat it like French fries.
1415 2018-04-11 21:32:07 Oh, I have another question. If Alberta is so concerned about jobs, why doesn't it invest in a refinery that would create permanent jobs? My issue with the pipeline is the bitumen inside it. Far less concerned if the oil was refined like the current Trans Mountain pipeline
1416 2018-04-11 21:32:03 Scaremongering by Nationals MSM propagandist campaigners spreading misinformation on behest of oil lobbyists and other climate change denier parasites who are vested in the  big oil business
1417 2018-04-11 21:31:52 Susan, the coup as you call it, happened in 2016 and is being put down now by Republicans and Democrats who believe in our constitution.

1419 2018-04-11 21:31:37 Some of you know the injuries and chronic pain I have been in. So I decided to try CBD oil. Now this hasn't been a miracle cure, but I will say it has brought my pain down closer to manageable levels. Even though it's legal now, still a bit pricey, but worth it.

1421 2018-04-11 21:31:22 Where there's oil...
1422 2018-04-11 21:31:02 That is the left bots hitting you.  We sanction Russia to crashed their market which Russian Central Bank has fall safe. This is over Oil fields so the Turks, Isreal, Sauds own pipeline. Sauds rule Middle East. Sauds buying up England debt. Islam Party rising up in Brussels.
1423 2018-04-11 21:30:57 I'm at the dealership getting my oil changed and honestly it's making me nervous cause I trust like 2 people other than myself to work on my car and the one who always does it was busy.
1424 2018-04-11 21:30:52 .@HDPA on @NewstalkZB  this morning re: the oil and gas announcement.

1436 2018-04-11 21:30:05 Just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what a deductible is then got really angry that car insurance won't cover your oil changes. How is your Wednesday going?
1437 2018-04-11 21:29:52 not legitimate news reports.  It was investigated by a separate governmental, non partisan group and they FOUND NO EVIDENCE...
1438 2018-04-11 21:29:43 This girl just told me she got off the plane in Texas and it smelled like “butter and peanut oil” 
1439 2018-04-11 21:29:41 Assad is obviously being framed again by the Al Qaeda terrorists he is destroying.  Wake up and learn what the rest of the world already knows.  Trump obviously knows too.

Starting a war of aggression is the ultimate crime.  Why do this?  For Bibi? For oil? CRAZY
1440 2018-04-11 21:29:40 To get beyond the buzzwords so we can have an educated discussion on what will happen, could happen, might happen - to have a better civic debate with non-CS people (e.g. if data is the new oil, what does that mean about regulating Facebook?).

1445 2018-04-11 21:29:17 Congratulations to all labour, NZ first and Green voters in Taranaki as they watch their high paying labour jobs in oil and gas search industries, disappear overseas to less socialistic voting countries
1446 2018-04-11 21:29:06 Remission from what may l ask?  What is canna oil also?
1447 2018-04-11 21:29:05 OK but how does this increase human SURVIVAL by reducing demand for oil?  This is simply feel-good-virtue-signalling, which raises the price of petrol in NZ, which is a new tax, that mostly effects the least able to afford such a price increase.
1448 2018-04-11 21:29:03 I just don't understand why they cannot leave the market to do its thing with oil and gas. 

If it's not:
(a) Financially viable- no drilling
(b) Market doesn't want oil- no drilling

It's not hard to understand Supply vs Demand ! 

It's been around since the earliest profession
1449 2018-04-11 21:29:01 Clinton wants a regime change to benefit the oil industry and the defense contractors.
We have no business meddling in Syria.
1450 2018-04-11 21:28:58 It's possible, IRL, neatsfoot oil makes leather soft and flexible. I guess you could have them use their own kind of oil to treat the leather.
Or you could have them use leather from an animal species from their home which already is more flexible then "Earth" leather.
1451 2018-04-11 21:28:53 Oil 66.70 usd 
1452 2018-04-11 21:28:48 @Megan_Woods You were lying on AM that members of the oil/gas industry thanked you for certainty their industry (& our standard of living) is destroyed. Per industry after you, they were blindsided.

But, okay, you give the supposed benefits, so I'm sure a responsible govt1/2
1453 2018-04-11 21:28:46 No I mean, did I misplace it or — [ she sighs, walking over to the cabinet to retrieve the oil for him, and to check her kettle for more tea, sighing again when she sees it’s empty ] Here. I — I’ve got to reorganize my notes real quick.
1454 2018-04-11 21:28:46 Make sure you put extra soybean oil in it. PUKE!

1456 2018-04-11 21:28:32 No Americans or British should have stayed in Iraq.

1465 2018-04-11 21:26:42 We both know neoconservatives in both parties (from Bush to Hillary) have sold out to the military-industrial complex and promulgated oil wars in the last 65 years, so don’t act like Dems are to blame. The establishment right has been far more complicit—especially since Reagan.
1466 2018-04-11 21:26:41 Mid-May has often marked a [TOP] in OIL over the last 24-years. Reminder to protect profits.
1467 2018-04-11 21:26:36 And being BUTT HURT (pretty funny)... This guy is tearing our nation apart. Just because you support him and voted for him doesn't make him less a horrible POTUS. You're right to support him, but there are so many issues surrounding him, its amazing you're still there for him.

1469 2018-04-11 21:26:02 Now get the palm oil out of your products
1470 2018-04-11 21:26:00 dark brown and lightly greased is the best way. Not a fan of the black ass shit swimming in oil 
1471 2018-04-11 21:25:57 Actually there have been about 100+ news reports of people being arrested for ILLEGALLY voting.
1472 2018-04-11 21:25:56 #WednesdayWisdom More AMERICANS died in #VegasShooting than in the recent unverified #Syrianchemicalattack Why are we concerned about Syrians? We get out! We get out now! Export more American oil to punish Russia. All of this Winning HURTS!!! Let's share the pain!
1473 2018-04-11 21:25:50 my dumbass decided to tan w no oil so now im 5 different shades of burnt
1474 2018-04-11 21:25:49 We have Rick Simpson oil already. I buy & use it all the time. Just took my daily dose.
1475 2018-04-11 21:25:43 @HyundaiCanada I have the Elantra GT Sport 2018, Manual says 10K/12 months, Bluelink says 12K/6 months, Dealer says 6K/6 months for the oil change. Which one do I follow?
1476 2018-04-11 21:25:35 Strategic geographically yes. Oil reserves no.  The end of oil is here. This is about territory and what sort of tomorrow do we want, or worse, allow to happen.
1477 2018-04-11 21:25:30 I feel decidedly uneasy about the fact that Donald Trump can tweet things that directly influence the stock markets. Oil prices jumped today on his rhetoric on Syria. Be assured someones making a lot of money in the background. POTUS should not be tweeting so freely.
1478 2018-04-11 21:25:29 The exploration ban is a good way to phase out the oil and gas industry without too much disruption.
1479 2018-04-11 21:25:27 Please Kickstart my new perfume. It’s called “La Malaisé” and is mostly Ben Gay and burnt oil.
1480 2018-04-11 21:25:27 I genuinely DO hate mayonnaise and most condiments!! If I want something to help my sandwich not be dry I will take guac, hummus, pesto, olive oil & vinegar, etc. but NEVER MAYO
1481 2018-04-11 21:25:25 West Dingle was still standing in 1954, but probably demolished by the time the oil depot was built close by.
1482 2018-04-11 21:25:22 @SnakeDiet when (not if) someone dies from hypoglycemia I hope you at least get sued for liability! There’s a term “snake oil” for remedies that don’t work and I think that’s what this is, the name says it all!! You may lose weight but will gain it back (1)
1483 2018-04-11 21:25:12 A "Giant step toward welfare reform"? Does this mean you're going to stop the government subsidizing of Big Oil and the airlines? Oh, you just mean you are going to take more things from the poor. #PresidentLiar
1484 2018-04-11 21:25:00 Not neccessarily at all.Canned olives in US are harvested early or green and lye and salt processed then dyed black. So much depends on harvest date in Extra Virgin Olive oil production or ripening method chosen by oil grower in soy,canola,corn oil production.
1485 2018-04-11 21:24:55 #Gracias my weakness in life is crisps... 
1486 2018-04-11 21:24:52 Yeah a reason for this at least in the US is because most milk chocolate does not contain cocoa butter (it's more profitable to sell it to cosmetics companies) and palm oil does not make a good substitute.
1487 2018-04-11 21:24:47 Probably  sometimes he gets backed up with hairballs even with the miralax and coconut oil...poor guy. I’m mad but like can’t actually be mad at him 
1488 2018-04-11 21:24:45 Because he's an android and years of cartoons have showed us they prefer oil to drink
1489 2018-04-11 21:24:40 Under the rule of congress it’s a good thing Rosenstein is getting impeached then huh?
1490 2018-04-11 21:24:36 You see oil? Otherwise, when did war affect  sm stock prices? Sorry i am melinia cant rememeber..
1491 2018-04-11 21:24:20 I like to oil his scalp, rub his back down, make him a drink after a long day.
1492 2018-04-11 21:24:19 Man I hope the gov of Missouri gets it.  He's such an arrogant snake oil salesman.
1493 2018-04-11 21:24:15 It wasn't the oil itself in Iraq, it was Saddam wanting to take the dollar out of the oil trade on his end, which may have caused others to do the same, hurting America's bottom line.
1494 2018-04-11 21:24:13 Earlier I took my car to get an oil change at Brahler and one of the employees dropped weed in my fucking car
1495 2018-04-11 21:24:09 Why are we sending oil to BC anyways? BC clearly doesn't need it. It will help them speed up the process of going green by 2019 and we'll just buy energy from them. Everyone wins!!
1496 2018-04-11 21:24:09 Why would she support Bernie then? He even admitted himself that not one of his major policies would pass through congress and become legislation? It was all snake oil and smoke and mirrors.
1497 2018-04-11 21:23:58 I usually just put some crushed garlic in some mayo. I'll have to try adding the lemon juice, some wholegrain mustard (which I always have) and olive oil. Thanks for the tip @gretskibabybabe

1499 2018-04-11 21:23:44 Look, I'll only give you that there is no proof of emoluments clause violation however, Trump is such a lying dirtbag, I have not trust that he isn't profiting from his office. That being said, I will just stick to the things we KNOW he's done already!
1500 2018-04-11 21:23:35 a progressive PM?  everyone in parliament continues to wear oil based products and fly + mostly drive oil burners.  So the price of petrol/gas in NZ goes up, which is a new tax on the last able to afford.  Where is the upside for the planet?
1501 2018-04-11 21:23:32 You're garbage, Donald. A vulgar carnival barker, a snake oil salesman, an ignorant clown, a sociopath who only cares about how much money you can grab. 

RESIGN. NOW.
1502 2018-04-11 21:23:20 Excellent decision by NZ govt to shutdown any new offshore oil & gas exploration permits. Anyone who thinks we shouldn’t be solely investing in clean energy is a moron.
1503 2018-04-11 21:22:59 @petenajarian Hi Pete, are you buying oil producers on the expectations for Mideast unrest and disruption?  I'm staying away, (maybe just a quick in-and-out) as shale producers still a big supply generator but also as rates rise in later stages of expansion since 2009

1506 2018-04-11 21:22:28 CBD oil is expensive as hell
1507 2018-04-11 21:22:20 Dude I’m literally getting an oil change right now. They’re trying to talk to me about how two of my tired won’t pass expecti
1508 2018-04-11 21:22:18 It's about pipelines more than oil, although Syria does have some oil and they are fighting over it at a local level (see Deir ez-Zor)
1509 2018-04-11 21:22:14 One of my doctors, think that my fish oil, flaxseed oil, and my vitamin B-12 was making my thyroid drop, but it isn’t. So...I’m gonna add another pill on my list. Yay!!!
1510 2018-04-11 21:22:11 I've always been down for killing a man for physical abuse. My great grandma told me to wait til he sleep & pour hot oil down his ear. That's the only time u got to kill a nigga.
1511 2018-04-11 21:22:08 Good grief, olive oil proving methods changed eh? That's really going to cause some sleepless nights in North Yorkshire. That's clearly what drove Brexit. 
1512 2018-04-11 21:22:07 I know them Arabs be making good money. I’m tryna become an Oil Tycoon.
1513 2018-04-11 21:21:54 its been day three using vitamin E oil and it’s working already
1514 2018-04-11 21:21:51 Cannabis oil is deffo 80% magic, seems to cure everything
1515 2018-04-11 21:21:43 @tomfletcherbc @JustinTrudeau There were at least 3 oil train derailments in Ont. this year, one with cars in a river. No news
1516 2018-04-11 21:21:32 Made an appointment to get my oil changed, been sitting here for an hour and they just started. Guess I need to start doing it myself.
1517 2018-04-11 21:21:31 He drinking some oil
1518 2018-04-11 21:21:23 Want white teeth? Coconut oil. Nice hair? Coconut oil. Moisturiser? Coconut oil. Cooking? Coconut oil. Long eye lashes? Coconut oil. Failing semester 2? Coconut oil. I mean is there really anything it cannot do??
1519 2018-04-11 21:21:23 Vancouver is the place where all the opposition is , outside of Vancouver people need to work like the rest of us in oil , gas , mining , logging etc. They are well in favour as the election results revealed . The election was a tie . That government is a joke
1520 2018-04-11 21:21:10 Think like a Tory, a Bush, and a Blair - it stinks. Arrogance+greed+power+oil.  Russia's the one thing standing in their way re Syria which had been planned for years and Russia is foiling, so they need an excuse to be backed up by other nations to attack Russian's in Syria, too.
1521 2018-04-11 21:21:07 “You” here referring to the oil companies Pruitt represents
1522 2018-04-11 21:21:04 @SpeakerRyan was the biggest phony of all time. His so-called ‘fiscally conservative’ budget ideas gutted the safety net in favor of tax cuts for the rich and always WORSENED long term deficits. Snake oil salesman through and through. Dear media, please stop falling for this trap
1523 2018-04-11 21:20:58 and he MISSED that deadline.  And to date... he is supposed to, by law, put those sanctions in place.  Regarding the illegals.. there is NO WAY you can know, as a citizen, who is legal to vote and who isn't.  Please, your BS is ridiculous!
1524 2018-04-11 21:20:56 I can see “OIL” in her eye.... 
1525 2018-04-11 21:20:56 'JAG is a believer, but I bet she, and other Grn hypocrites, won’t stop flying, using ministerial cars, partaking in carbon-creating activities, while telling us that we all have to stop. She talks of being aspirational. That’s not aspirational; that’s just being a dick' - W/Oil
1526 2018-04-11 21:20:52 After deoderisation the oil chemist will then add BHA or BHT to GE seed oil to prevent rancidity then pack corrosive oil into clear plastic BHA  bottle where phalates will leach into oil and tell the consumer it is safe because the refinery staff said so.
1527 2018-04-11 21:20:42 It seems a little bit early to me, and I believe PBR is not confirming the view on Brazil, otherwise I would expect a reversal on oil's px
1528 2018-04-11 21:20:34 Hello @IcelandFoods thanks for banning palm oil amazing. Can you introduce a product for sale so that the profits go to reforestation and conservation #PalmOil #PalmOilAlarmCall I'd buy it.. ;) Orangutans are very similar to humans, they think and feel.
1529 2018-04-11 21:20:30 The oil my face produces can deep fry a bag of chips...

1533 2018-04-11 21:20:01 When you buy face oil that you thought was 6.50 but rings up as 18 but you’re too lazy to say anything
1534 2018-04-11 21:19:57 Castor oil is a blessing okurrrr
1535 2018-04-11 21:19:53 Following the recent string of violent crimes which include the armed robbery at the Jah Oil fuel station in Brikama, the office of police chief said such acts of lawlessness will not be condoned and it has resolved to use all its legal powers to ensure compliance with the law.
1536 2018-04-11 21:19:48 This weird “we can tricky-poo conservatives into liberalism” has to stop.
1537 2018-04-11 21:19:30 My brother just told me he couldn't do my oil change on Saturday because "he's sleeping." lol mood
1538 2018-04-11 21:19:21 Dude, stfu. High taxation? In Venezuela?? The State seized industries, ran them into the ground, and then decided to make up the deficits with imports when oil was high. Oil crashed, game over. Stop comparing my country to your stupid GOP dystopia scenario.
1539 2018-04-11 21:19:16 @JustinTrudeau Good for you and your personal day. I hope you get lots of rest and couch time while I’m working in the oil industry which you are so keen to destroy.  Must be exhausting taking away people’s livelihoods. Rest up big guy.
1540 2018-04-11 21:19:11 @realDonaldTrump you aren't after Assad you are after oil. You are killing our kids sending them to war. U r a dangerous man
1541 2018-04-11 21:19:03 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1542 2018-04-11 21:19:02 It's all about a pipeline,
Someone said to me.
I don't know the detail,
But it seem plausible to me

So I'd guess this is about oil 
And also about the gas,
To feed from Saudi to Europe
So who be against this,who can guess?

And anyone in the way
Is collateral damage sad to say
1543 2018-04-11 21:19:00 So you will probably see big pharma selling their own version of CBD / thc oil in the next few years... It's not hard to understand.
1544 2018-04-11 21:18:55 Ever seen first hand an Oil Sands operation? Perhaps you've been involved in a SAGD project? Maybe you've designed and implemented pipelines? Tank Farms? Batteries? Pumping Stations? Anything? Just looking for another source beyond your father.
1545 2018-04-11 21:18:47 the oil industry are huge investors in green technology because they know the writing is on the wall. Z energy are the ones putting in electric car stations. No one likes oil drilling pollution and our reliance on fossil fuels but we have to be practical.
1546 2018-04-11 21:18:44 Even his Kong type frozen things are fancy. Today it was carrots and a little kibble with cranberries, pumpkin, sunbutter and coconut oil.
1547 2018-04-11 21:18:38 have just soaked my hoodie, pillows, teddy and beddings in olbus oil in the hope it will send me to sleep and cure me overnight
1548 2018-04-11 21:18:38 rose oil facial mask
1549 2018-04-11 21:18:35 Con’t thoughts on Facebook:
6. Facebook will never be a Standard Oil
7. Congress needs a change with new and young minds in order to regulate new firms in this era
8. Facebook will never change it’s fundamental business model
9. People love having this platform for free
1550 2018-04-11 21:18:29 WTF, America isn't in the middle east for oil. Stop being a pussy and say the real reason why.
1551 2018-04-11 21:18:25 Because this is a civil war and the Iraq was about Oil and protecting the pipelines.
1552 2018-04-11 21:18:23 Thats for heating and cooling, all electric, no gas bill in current home in az, easy living compared to ny, rediculous bills for ac and oil
1553 2018-04-11 21:18:15 Choice of city: Cannonball, North Dakota
Definition of problem: The pipeline oil spills in North Dakota effecting the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and raising concern given the health risks of oil invested waters which can lead to contaminated food and cause deathly poisonous.
1554 2018-04-11 21:18:07 Who ever you are... you're the one with Alternative Facts! Have a great day!
1555 2018-04-11 21:18:06 Thank God...not too many women in the gym today looking at me like some sex meat...all I wanna do is do these push ups in the middle of the gym where everyone can see me, with baby oil on and these grey sweat pants...damn
1556 2018-04-11 21:18:05 First oil. Next step, coal.
1557 2018-04-11 21:17:58 10's (if not hundreds) of billions spent developing the oil sands & next to no plans to get it anywhere but the US refineries! Perfect example of this idiotic, lack of foresight is @cenovus spending $75M on rail loading w/o securing any rail cars! Now the rail co's got em!
1558 2018-04-11 21:17:40 Obama retains oil sanctions against Iran, dashes Pakistan’s hopes
1559 2018-04-11 21:17:28 And you're tax dollars ARE paying for what Congress creates as law... The "Witch Hunt" is a legal investigation and the sanctions were a act passed by congress and signed by Trump.
1560 2018-04-11 21:17:20 Sure. US-war machine led by CIA is doing a great job. Mass murderer all the time and US army is ready to play the good guy. They didn't do shit in Myanmar. They didn't do shit in cetral africa or nigeria. Time to get rid of that oil and work on substitutes.
1561 2018-04-11 21:17:15 There is no selective pressure against politicians who deny climate change in favor of "big oil." 
As a matter of fact, for high-ranking officials, there's a really nice payout every time you kick the #environment a little more
1562 2018-04-11 21:17:13 High Oil prices use to cause Recessions.
1563 2018-04-11 21:17:04 I  meant no offence I just found it strange why anyone would ask Scottish people about a\ treesa may joining a trumpet in bombing an innocent country that only has oil. But why not ask the english welsh irish too ? They will lose sons/daughters/fathers/brothers/sisters too
1564 2018-04-11 21:16:52 I’ve done nthn to my hair but going to get a deep conditioner hot oil treatments couple weeks back  but before then using Jamaican Castro oil same as the shampoo  but i did stop taking these biotin gummie vitamins got from gnc
1565 2018-04-11 21:16:44 Well truth be told... Big reason W went into Iraq was Saddam and Russia were cooking up to use the ruble to buy and sell oil instead of the dollar ... Biggest reason the dollar holds it's value is everybody must use it to buy or sell oil. Hope that mess doesn't start up again.
1566 2018-04-11 21:16:40 Because Jacob Rothschild, Rupert Murdoch et al want that oil. So they make it our problem
1567 2018-04-11 21:16:34 Paul Ryan not seeking re-election means we can expect hours upon hours of air time the media will give him to repackage and resell his snake oil as if it weren't all poison to begin with.
1568 2018-04-11 21:16:29 What did he say about California's Oil deposits? Are you aware that California has THE dirtiest Oil in NA? And that Nigerian Oil is even worse? Sounds like you like to spew forth platitudes instead of doing real research! Canadian Processing is the most environmentally regulated!
1569 2018-04-11 21:16:12 So where is the transition plan? 
What $$ is going to be replaced by the billions of revenue oil and gas generates? 
Don't say Solar and Wind because we import those. 
Don't say tourism because we already have that.
Don't say electronics, because we can't compete there either
1570 2018-04-11 21:16:05 Trump is to Truth what
Water is to Oil
1571 2018-04-11 21:16:05 Nothing without oil money....bet he was a Chelsea fan a decade ago
1572 2018-04-11 21:16:04 There is no oil in Qatar scumb#g. You prefer russian or asian mafia money or american funds money that sack millions of people in the world leaving them in desperation.
1573 2018-04-11 21:15:39 I still use baby products from baby cologne to baby Johnson vaseline and oil for my night scents. I go to bed smelling like an infant
1574 2018-04-11 21:15:32 hmmmm wheres your evidence about election.... and the Russian sanctions passed a REPUBLICAN CONGRESS... Senate vote was 98 to 2 and they DID give him a deadline that he missed.  You clearly are trying to change history! you're a liar or misinformed!
1575 2018-04-11 21:15:29 Sadly there are not many documented studies available online of cancer treatment in humans using cannabis oil, mostly testimonials. Maybe one day you can come to California to meet some of the people who beat cancer with cannabis oil. You can meet the canines too.
1576 2018-04-11 21:15:29 Jesus. Some of the comments on the live videos of Jacinda & co talking about the gas and oil 

“Sit down and put your muzzle on”

What is wrong with people :(
1577 2018-04-11 21:15:27 where the proof. It was prob ably Israel. They re the only winners in all this conflict. Oil!
1578 2018-04-11 21:15:26 Yes - fuck the #Salishsea  - must get that Texas Oil Company some more money quick!!! - - Maybe some more tax breaks too!! #stopKM

1583 2018-04-11 21:15:06 If Syria had oil we would have gone in years ago .
1584 2018-04-11 21:15:04 You niggaz out here are too curious about being with another man but y’all swear y’all not gay tho. The only thing another man can do for me is change the oil in my truck or cut my hair.
1585 2018-04-11 21:15:00 Not really.  This will not create 11,000 tourism jobs and the ones it does create will be lower paying than the average wage in the oil and gas sector.  Our tourism infrastructure is overloaded around key areas at the moment anyway.  Try again.
1586 2018-04-11 21:14:59 Just saw Cristiano Ronaldo with his top off.
Say no more.  .....ahhhh sweet dreams Heid.
1587 2018-04-11 21:14:58 No oil in Congo 
1588 2018-04-11 21:14:56 He should change it to dollar signs & oil company logos
1589 2018-04-11 21:14:46 The Straits of Mackinac offer pristine waters &views for all to enjoy. Last week there was a fluid leak (benzene). Owners always said won't happen. Now comes news 2 oil pipelines have been dented by marine activity (anchor strike). Enbridge needs to decommission these pipelines
1590 2018-04-11 21:14:46 PSA: tea tree oil gets rid of pimples within 48 hours 
1591 2018-04-11 21:14:45 GLAMOUR: Often use a massage oil.
1592 2018-04-11 21:14:31 It's always about the oil, gas, commodities, etc. That and the tons of money the military industrial complex makes on war.
1593 2018-04-11 21:13:57 No alternative facts are not logic, just stupidity.
1594 2018-04-11 21:13:57 Whatever it is it looks way too liberal and should be replaced with an awesome gun or an oil derrick.

1598 2018-04-11 21:13:48 What a wonderful idea, do you have any idea how much this would cost? Use that money and put it into the NHS and other sectors that need it. Stop following America who ONLY follow THE OIL! You didn't care when they dropped MOAB  and multiple tomahawk missiles, absolute pricks  
1599 2018-04-11 21:13:45 Make your research about Venezuela. Embargo's were imposed by the capitalist forces in need of oil to stop socialism.
1600 2018-04-11 21:13:43 I'm sure Paul Ryan will be selling $95/gram medical marijuana "oil" in Reading...while @PAStatePolice still arrest thousands/year for a few grams of weed. Smh. #ProhibitionSucks
1601 2018-04-11 21:13:40 Hi Steve, our prices and our promotions are in no way linked. Our recent price increase is simply following increases of international Brent crude oil prices - which is currently the highest it's been since the end of 2014. ^MZ
1602 2018-04-11 21:13:35 I remember Midnight Oil did a song about the western desert.
Great insight about the 'other' western desert thou!
1603 2018-04-11 21:13:32 not liberal logic.  Just Logic! lolololol
1604 2018-04-11 21:13:28 James Shaw says ending oil and gas exploration is the “greatest economic opportunity in at least a generation”
1605 2018-04-11 21:13:27 Shout out to my dad for teaching me how to work on cars. Even something as simple as an oil change. That’s something I’m taking with me for the rest of my life
1606 2018-04-11 21:13:26 i mean i agree, an oil rig would make more sense on there
1607 2018-04-11 21:13:19 @FrankTumwebazek when was the last time you informed Ugandans about the progress on Oil exploration? Should we take it that cabinet never discuss oil?
1608 2018-04-11 21:13:18 I love my Cleopatra oil
1609 2018-04-11 21:13:11 @MelissaLeeCNBC  Do the traders think the MLPs will go higher with oil prices? @CNBCFastMoney
1610 2018-04-11 21:13:05 It's strange u haven't mentioned that a chemical attack, like Sarin, as they're claiming, leaves redness in the face&purple nails. Look it up. There's also oil in the illegally Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights, they want it. Strange u don't mention ANY of this. It's all lies
1611 2018-04-11 21:12:58 3. PSG Weren’t known before they got all that dirty oil money. Break FFP rules so many times to win Ligue 1 and make it so boring and one-sided so that another team has to spend more than them to win it. Also, they suck up all of France and Brazil’s talent with post-2012 cash 2/4
1612 2018-04-11 21:12:42 This will never happen so long as the pharma giants promise jobs to MPs after serving their terms, it’s brown envelope tactics in plain sight. Do you know that current legislation bans any cure for cancer. They want to keep selling snake oil to profit from the sick.
1613 2018-04-11 21:12:40 hey look at oil prices reaching 3 year highs......Russia and Iran thrilled.
1614 2018-04-11 21:12:38 On my list of idiotic things to complain about today- it drives me CRAZY how many celebs, pro MUAs, etc LOOOOVE La Mer  shit  has  mineral  oil  in it if I had La Mer money, I’d spend it on better shit than that 
1615 2018-04-11 21:12:29 @BabestationTV wow it’s seems ages since @danniiharwood was last on hope she’s feeling #Filthy tonight and hope she’s goes #OldSkool in the alley way again #Oil #OilOverload #XRated #WetNWild #OilFans #PhoneSex #MakeItHappen
1616 2018-04-11 21:12:20 Ur facts are clearly so far left on the field there is no point in trying to reason with liberal logic.
1617 2018-04-11 21:12:15 @NissanofHoover absolutely never bringing my car there again, wrong oil, XM radio still not fixed, hung up on when I called back to raise concerns, now paying for a 2nd oil change for the day with the "correct" oil...wtf kind of service center is this?
1618 2018-04-11 21:12:04 Pipeline 5 was dented by a ship today. This along with it's corrosion is just asking for an oil spill in our Great Lakes. It's time to hold our politicians in Lansing responsible. An oil spill in our Great Lakes would devastate Michigan's economy.
1619 2018-04-11 21:12:04 So agree....meet the olive farmer she will talk you through her oil make you laugh,choke,cough and weep for joy after eating her Black Krimea tomatoes with fresh basil drizzled with fruity picual oil while standing in her grove looking at snow capped mountains on a river bank...
1620 2018-04-11 21:12:02 I must check if we’ve stocked up on midnight oil.
1621 2018-04-11 21:11:43 People absolutely did vote illegally or have you not read all the specific instances where this happened? Also he is president not on a deadline under dems in congress. He’s the boss. Also my tax $$ were not paying for sanctions... they are however paying for a dem op witch hunt
1622 2018-04-11 21:11:36 What about those two teams that have spent loads of money from oil rich owners who have done so well in the UCL this season, oh wait.... #psg #mcfc
1623 2018-04-11 21:11:19 @2faceidibia does your nose smell like hot oil
1624 2018-04-11 21:11:13 fighting seems to be gradually getting closer to the south west corner ~ where certain companies are busy drilling gas/oil from the Syrian Golan territory #bbcnews
1625 2018-04-11 21:11:00 They posted the Banter drafts too early. Ororo becoming Palm oil, Haba Madrid.. Too early. Didn't City vs United teach you guys anything? Delay Banter till after Full time whistle.
1626 2018-04-11 21:10:59 I really need to get my oil changed 
1627 2018-04-11 21:10:51 Come live in my bubble everyone is happy about the transport policy and thinks the oil exploration block is too weak
1628 2018-04-11 21:10:50 So...assuming that you want to continue providing every human with 2500kcal/day, can you name a more environmentally friendly oil crop?
1629 2018-04-11 21:10:47 Thanks! After learning about the issues around palm oil, we felt we needed to act – and quickly
1630 2018-04-11 21:10:38 *come in for an Oil change*

Mechanic : Yeah so your car's alternator is 40 miles away from bursting, your fuel cap is broken, your brakes needed to be changed, you need the premium oil too because yeah, and you need a new cylinder head gasket.

Me : "How much is the oil change?"
1631 2018-04-11 21:10:27 My goodness russia has helped Assad clear ISIS from Syria. Who do you think they have been fighting? The problem here is that the USA the country that has a 23 Trillion deficit wants to steal Assad oil so they make up a story so that gullible people think they are do gooders.
1632 2018-04-11 21:10:23 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1633 2018-04-11 21:10:15 Why are we playing high stakes geopolitical poker over Syria? Oil and gas. Oligarch profits. Globalism. It has absolutely nothing to do with our national interest. #BBCNews
1634 2018-04-11 21:10:12 When he left Kuwait, the US told him to leave and not burn the oil fields, which he burned down. 

Would you rather have the international community continue to capitulate to these state sponsored acts of terrorism?

1637 2018-04-11 21:10:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1638 2018-04-11 21:09:51 It’s a metaphor, Frank, not an oil painting.
1639 2018-04-11 21:09:41 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, however its help, and thus to drag it into the political arena.
1640 2018-04-11 21:09:30 Debating with you is like debating with a 3 year old. If you don’t get your way, you’ll scream and protest til you do. Alberta, the oil companies and Kinder Morgan should sue BC, you and Horgan for the costs of the delays.
1641 2018-04-11 21:09:28 If i give you oil you will support Salah dumb
1642 2018-04-11 21:09:17 What's different? We don't have a relationship worth saving with Russia any more. Russia's economy isn't growing at seven percent any more. Fracking means we don't need Russian oil any more. The list of factors more important than Corbyn is near-endless.
1643 2018-04-11 21:09:15 @seanhannity questions for you. What law offices were raided? What law firm is representing Cambridge analytica? Who Lobby's for Gazprom oil?
1644 2018-04-11 21:09:08 يقول علماء الفلك أن عدد النجوم المتناثرة في أرجاء الكون يزيد على عدد حبيبات الرمل الموجودة في كوكب الأرض .
1645 2018-04-11 21:09:00 Which are made from 2 polymers. Which is a product of OIL. Still nothing on the sewage hey? That’s what I thought. My grandpa said Never Argue with an Idiot. They will pull you down to their level and beat you with Experience. Look like the experience is over flowing in Van
1646 2018-04-11 21:08:53 @TheDisabledDiva @MSpals @meeganwilliams
It's getting cooler but, not much more. The extra warm days or not good for me.
On good note I guess, I am trying hemp oil. We shall see what happens. Have a good day.
1647 2018-04-11 21:08:50 apparently only 70% of their palm oil is sustainable, but that may have changed since the article was published. i’ll look into it and let you know if you’d like!
1648 2018-04-11 21:08:44 Yeah the prime minister. Ban those  offshore oil and gas people from Aotearoa
1649 2018-04-11 21:08:39 Right about now, NWO (With OIL) court is in full effect, Judge Muhammad presiding, in the case of Ice Cube vs the Al-Thani family...
1650 2018-04-11 21:08:38 Flavored body oil seems like a good investment...
1651 2018-04-11 21:08:27 Is it not time to let the oil rich states deal with the problems of the middle east, they don't like/want us, so let them deal with the cult threatening us in the West 
1652 2018-04-11 21:08:22 Critical key question for the government’s oil and gas announcement today - will holders of existing exploration permits be allowed to graduate up to a mining permit? Under existing law, exploration holders get rights to apply for mining permits. #oilandgas
1653 2018-04-11 21:08:17 女と女がイチャついてる夢から覚めて地獄リアルワールドに帰還してしまった
1654 2018-04-11 21:08:11 Unlike the oil companies, FB doesn't ask for military protection. Unlike the auto industry, it doesn't seek government welfare. Unlike the big banks, it doesn't ask for bailouts. It doesn't even ask customers to pay for its services. And it's the villain now?

Only trouble is he’s actually flat out lying about the numbers
Pouring oil on the fire with no consequences for him but ramping hatred and extremism amongst those gullible enough to believe his lies
People like you

Not you William, obv, I hope
1657 2018-04-11 21:07:56 How poetic. Who doesn’t see through this snake oil salesman’s bullshit?
1658 2018-04-11 21:07:52 I can’t even go get an oil change without feeling uncomfortable bc ppl out here have serious staring problems...
1659 2018-04-11 21:07:35 Russian ruble devaluated  only yesterday to the  lowest record since 2016 just after Trump’s tweet while US funds has increased. Russia was one of the loosing economies in the last couple of years during the falling oil prices as its economy is heavily  based on selling oil/gas.
1660 2018-04-11 21:07:31 Actually she was-Janna Ryan was a corporate lobbyist for drug, cigar and oil companies until she married Paul and moved to Wisconsin to start a family
1661 2018-04-11 21:07:28 Absolutely worth every single bit of the Clubs filthy oil money
1662 2018-04-11 21:07:25 Isn't there also just a lot of AI snake oil generally?
1663 2018-04-11 21:07:14 Ryan Zinke who opened up all the protected land for drilling is being paid by the oil industry and gave his friend the electricity contract for Puerto Rico when at the time he only had two employees and was from his city of Whitefish, Betsy DeVos who has never held a job before
1664 2018-04-11 21:07:09 Good to see the oil lantern in your head finally lit up! Took longer than it would for most but I refused to give up on you. Positive thinking is a pro, not a con. But hey, I don't expect you to understand this
Have a nice life loser
#checkmate
1665 2018-04-11 21:07:03 Hey @RachelNotley how about you build refineries to keep your oil in our country instead of shipping out bitumen?
The people of BC don't want your pipeline ruining our coast and killing our wildlife (which it will).
#StopKM
@ElizabethMay
1666 2018-04-11 21:06:45 I think we all just waiting on you to make big beard oil 
1667 2018-04-11 21:06:42 If it wasn't for that "overregulation", companies would have oil rigs and mining sites in all the national parks.  Kinda like what Trump and Pruitt's allowing now.
1668 2018-04-11 21:06:39 What a misused of the Indonesian oil money enjoying freely by Nederland / Holland government!
1669 2018-04-11 21:06:37 #pnpcbc
Oil sands oil cannot be part of our future if we are going to meet our climate change commitments. Other conventional oil and gas products can be sold. Same story whether you are Conservative Liberal or NDP.
1670 2018-04-11 21:06:35 Wanting to go to war with no evidence. The US/UK truly are warmongers. All about money and oil, sound familiar. Disgrace. #Warmongers #notowar #notinmyname

1675 2018-04-11 21:05:30 So, he is going to fix oju ore for you?  Lmao. He is also going to stabilize Naira for you,  after all, oil is now above $70 per barrel
1676 2018-04-11 21:05:28 Archbishop , I suspect you are just a Political jobber. So because Buhari visited you with loads of Pounds & Oil wells and you now remembering about Christians killed by Buhari. Sir pls don’t want to insult but anybody romancing with that Man Buhari is also a Murderer. Stop it

1678 2018-04-11 21:05:18 Stunning argument! Gas, oil, fossil fuels, does it really matter? Its about resources that are not ours to take. But if you want to split hairs, feel free 
1679 2018-04-11 21:05:03 Seems like deep state USA set this up. Genie oil may be the key. Interesting owners.
1680 2018-04-11 21:05:02 hmmm well you can try it out again with an oil based primer and see how it works! you can try becca’s first light priming filter
1681 2018-04-11 21:04:58 Mary Fallin Governor of Oklahoma not only works for big oil & gas! But Hotel & Motel chains! She has never worked for the people of Oklahoma only the wealthy!

1682 2018-04-11 21:04:51 @TOPCA_Executive @portcredit @Portcreditbia @ONenvironment @ONlabour @citymississauga wish our community didn’t have a chemical and oil smell flowing through it from the waterfront development. Control measures put in place are not working.

1684 2018-04-11 21:04:19 Russia is in a tough position.She is correct that the west has committed suicide by democracy. But Culturally she belongs with the west, economically with the oil states of the middle east, and politically with the Chinese. The problem is the Russians are Right, and We are Wrong.
1685 2018-04-11 21:04:10 Oil changes, brake pads, Sally mae, Victoria and all her secrets.
1686 2018-04-11 21:04:06 Your quote is mumbo jumbo constructed by liberal left to keep you hugging trees.
The reality that BC wants you to believe is that this shouldn’t happen. The oil and gas that you use and presume comes from somewhere. It’s been approved, the pipeline will benefit the country.
1687 2018-04-11 21:04:02 Correct me if I'm wrong but don't they use sustainable palm oil? I just looked online and it said they decided to switch to ethical palm oil
1688 2018-04-11 21:03:56 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
1689 2018-04-11 21:03:43 What socialism didn't work?  They have more oil than Saudi Arabia. Send Bernie to the rescue

1696 2018-04-11 21:03:08 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-04-11, is 7.575.
1697 2018-04-11 21:03:06 The greatest curse of any nation is to have same party in government for 16yrs with oil boom without 100km of good roads, less 4000 megawatts and 50km railway.
1698 2018-04-11 21:03:04 Alberta's mistake was to put aside Peter Lougheed frame for a slow & carefull TS Dev. with research to reduce enviro. impacts. Ralph Klein gave the Oil Giants OPEN BAR for a FAST BUCK and he didnt give a shit about the MESS it did create_Then came the Climate Warming MENACE

1700 2018-04-11 21:02:53 why does taco works use cottonseed oil 
1701 2018-04-11 21:02:52 Yes that is a sad truth, thank you. It is also sad that money and ulterior motives such as Oil can motivate governments to turn a blind eye to atrocities
1702 2018-04-11 21:02:44 If u ask me WHO'S C.RONALDO? I will tell u HE'S ANOINTING OIL.  @Cristiano @RMadridInfo @ChampionsLeague
1703 2018-04-11 21:02:42 Sorry you misunderstood, because of KM farce, foreign money no longer wants to invest in Canada but rather places like Texas. Alberta is the only oil jurisdiction in the world that cant sell its own resources
1704 2018-04-11 21:02:39 We call him ororo because ROnaldo, the first two letters ororo means oil, like anointing oil!

1706 2018-04-11 21:02:35 Why do you hate Native Americans? Diversity? Protecting our beautiful country from turning it into a wasteland, future superfund site by giving free access to the oil & gas industries?  Why are there not 50 shades of beige in your dept?
1707 2018-04-11 21:02:34 OIL DIFF: 5.48 -> 5.45
1708 2018-04-11 21:02:30 The pressure from the outside strengthens the hardliners. Good relations strengthens the reformers. Now it’s the hardliners that are coming back out on top.

Re the Shah, the US neglected Iran and started pumping Saudi oil for two years before the revolution. Iran was broke...
1709 2018-04-11 21:02:27 I bet Saudi are gutted as well that oil is going higher... Especially as it had been struggling to break higher than that $70 area!

1714 2018-04-11 21:02:05 it's real good. tiny, well executed sliders and truffle oil fries.
1715 2018-04-11 21:02:04 All you need to know about Syria; Iran has lots of oil, and the best way to move it westwards, is in a pipeline through Syria. US and UK etc want to lay waste to Iran and Syria, then take their oil. They really don't care one bit about ordinary Syrian people. The end #Syriawar
1716 2018-04-11 21:02:00 Bros @olamide_ybnl i just dey rock ur song Ororo Anointing oil #RNALD #HARDWORKER
1717 2018-04-11 21:02:00 With Bolton and other Bush admin lackeys we are just as likely to bomb Iran (or Libya or whichever country has the most oil) as we are Syria in response to Syria using illegal chemical weapons
1718 2018-04-11 21:01:46 He is the snake oil salesmen of brexit. He is racist, but he's intelligent enough to stay just on the right side of the law peddling his half truths.
1719 2018-04-11 21:01:45 Yes. We should build pipelines from coast to coast, build enough refineries to become self-sufficient and stop importing oil... And then, become massive oil exporters. Billions of dollars just waiting for us, and we do nothing to get them !
1720 2018-04-11 21:01:41 My gf stayed in San Jose after her police test to get an oil change for my car. Life saverrrrrr 
1721 2018-04-11 21:01:41 I was thinking that as well but there are spot in between his toes that are bad and when I cleaned one of his paws it looked like it had been bleeding at one point and yeah  but for the hotspots the coconut oil will help too??
1722 2018-04-11 21:01:23 No oil in Syria so is the rush to war to help drive arms sales and generate billions?

1725 2018-04-11 21:01:09 Its not about chemical weapons being used on civilians, its about oil, power and greed. Assad using chemical weapons on his own people is being used as a reason to start a war just like Saddam Hussein having WMD. The chemical weapons are being used by extremists backed by theWest
1726 2018-04-11 21:01:04 lolololol ok... By your logic, Trump should have been fired when he missed the Russia sanctions deadline.  Or maybe Trump continuing to claim millions of ppl voted illegally (been investigated). or how about Emoluments Clause violations.  I can go on...
1727 2018-04-11 21:01:04 U.S. Oil Production growth projected to be led by light, sweet crude oil
1728 2018-04-11 21:00:54 I am sure that you screwed somebody that makes less than $15000  a year. How about that welfare that you gave to the billionaires and the oil company?
1729 2018-04-11 21:00:50 That's roughly $1,000 in membership dues. Could be from Americans living there in the oil industry or other reasons, like embassy staff or military attached to embassies & consulates. A non-story. Do better reporting.
1730 2018-04-11 21:00:49 That might have been a good argument years ago, but we're doing great on oil now.  Who's the only country that benefits if we go to war?
1731 2018-04-11 21:00:35 Would anyone like to offer a prize for #guesstheharvestdate? I dunno, maybe a bottle of cold pressed rapeseed oil?
1732 2018-04-11 21:00:34 The report is all well and good but the bottom line is that only a fraction of the oil will be recovered in a major spill. More tankers and more oil equals greater risk. We have already done much damage to our oceans so lets take a break. #BCTOO
1733 2018-04-11 21:00:33 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1734 2018-04-11 21:00:25 I accidentally got the oil from one of those plug-in air fresheners on my hands this morning. Cinnamon flavored. My eyes are nearly burned out of my head - they should spontaneously combust any time now and I still smell like a bag of Christmas pine cones.
1735 2018-04-11 21:00:22 oh so now its up to 20,000 barrels truth is it must be much larger because big oil wont ever be truthful
1736 2018-04-11 21:00:19 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
1737 2018-04-11 21:00:18 April 11, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1738 2018-04-11 21:00:17 Lol... Jamaican oil.. Ae..
1739 2018-04-11 21:00:09 Do you know the benefits of using sunflower oil? Some of these include smoothing the skin and hair by helping it retain moisture, it’s hypoallergenic, which makes it safe to use on most skin types, and it’s a great beauty aid that has been used in anti-aging
1740 2018-04-11 21:00:04 Why don't you let the investigation play out, Dr. Stein hardly seems innocent, at best a useful idiot in Russia's games to destabilize the US.  And Putin is as close to the embodiment of big oil as it gets, yet she is next to him at a table.  Hmmm.
1741 2018-04-11 21:00:03 No beans? I love chickpeas. I eat them daily, nuked for 1 minute, then I add coconut oil or olive oil and salt.
1742 2018-04-11 21:00:01 What annoys me the most is its probably Scotland's Oil that pays for their wars. They waste millions on war & we get foodbanks & told to shut up, they're in charge of foreign affairs. Pffftt..
1743 2018-04-11 20:59:55 It always has been about oil. Just look at Iraq.
1744 2018-04-11 20:59:52 +HR+ @suluusa is your product, Camelina Oil 3065638010, edible? Can it be used raw  for salads and cooking?
1745 2018-04-11 20:59:45 You have a fair point. But weighed in the balance, is it our business to help start a proxy war between USA and Russia?

We didn’t invade Zimbabwe. We’re ignoring South Africa. No one ever saved the Somalis. Hell, we don’t give a shit unless there is oil money in play. No to WW3!
1746 2018-04-11 20:59:43 Seems like the oil sands have a much tighter emotional grip on the Conservatives  #justsaying
1747 2018-04-11 20:59:29 Why is oil so expensive and why cant i be rich

1755 2018-04-11 20:58:45 The more you strip the skin of oil the more oil it produces, also don’t forget to moisturize and tone for your skin type
1756 2018-04-11 20:58:44 Again this is where I start drifting. How did PDP put purposeless money in d hand of people to grow non oil businesses such that a whoopin 3mill jobs was lost in this administration?Coruption is in this govt as much as it was in previous govts.They only do a better job at coverup

that’s how we become kings and queens
1758 2018-04-11 20:58:15 @CoastProtectors Dear World: boycott oil from Canada. The colonists here want to build a pipeline across BC to the coast from Alberta. We pay alot for gas already and now they want to sell overseas. We need world support to stop this.
1759 2018-04-11 20:58:10 Stop getting involved in other countries affairs. Or is it something to do with oil.

1786 2018-04-11 20:55:56 Children's Museum is honestly lots of fun!  There's also a hotel right next to Lucas Oil Stadium that used to be a train station, has Pullman cars for suites, kind of neat if you're into that thing.  (And shrimp cocktail at St Elmos, I know you said no food but it's low cal!)

1788 2018-04-11 20:55:38 I don’t fucking understand if trump has got problem with Russia why he launched missile on Russia? Instead of launching them on Syrian. Thing is simple they all together all they want is destroy Muslims country. They after there money and oil.  #DonaldTrumpisabellend
1789 2018-04-11 20:55:38 This month I started drinking infused fruit water, got an essential oil diffuser and started using activated charcoal. I am out of control and need to get this all out of my system.
1790 2018-04-11 20:55:36 From the trains full of oil... that get filled up in Alberta. The reason the pipeline was done is because it was a lot cheaper than trains. The one thing I'm not sure about though is railway capacity..... no clue where the cap is on the existing rail lines.
1791 2018-04-11 20:55:33 The cleansing oil and toning water from balanced series, and the essence from natural series. It's all pretty good, but really love cleansing oil.
1792 2018-04-11 20:55:23 Cat is still researching the effectiveness of telegraphing your attack...Cat says, see price of oil.
1793 2018-04-11 20:55:23 Terrorism wouldn't be a 'take them back and put them on trial, either' you become a terrorist, you are being treated like the people you want to make suffer, it's funny how  they go so easy on REAL criminals, the oil barons, the weapon system creators and terrorists, almost 'odd'
1794 2018-04-11 20:55:21 In addition the pipe carries oil from canadian company’s.  Quit creating confusion. We are a country built with international capital just as we invest in many other countries.
1795 2018-04-11 20:55:21 Check tire pressure, rotate tires, add air, oil change and wash

Shit shouldn’t take more than 30mins
1796 2018-04-11 20:55:17 @dbarnes4444 - thousands of good paying jobs in Alberta to produce oil, 1000’s more to build, 100 s of high tech to maintain, providing energy to east and west provinces at competitive, less trucks on road , not selling at discounts to compete, unity, endless list of opportunity

1800 2018-04-11 20:54:59 Because they've profited and gained control from oil and war for so long now that they're become too ignorant to look for another way of living.
1801 2018-04-11 20:54:58 i did my oil change yesterday and @mrlube emails me today about 8$ off an oil change 
1802 2018-04-11 20:54:44 I’m wrapping them but he freaking loves the coconut oil it’s pretty funny
1803 2018-04-11 20:54:32 Russia has oil, alcohol, but no good brisket and lousy weather.

1812 2018-04-11 20:53:48 1) Just so you know, allowing permits and consents on oil and gas to continue leaves a lot of room for companies. Sites mostly consented for 8 wells and production facilities. And they can drill what are called sidetracks to consented wells to have a second crack at them.
1813 2018-04-11 20:53:42 So a new oil pipeline right of way THROUGH a major city.   That won't have any complaints...
1814 2018-04-11 20:53:30 the subtext of this tweet really reminded me of the 'i am an oil man' speech from daniel day lewis in there will be blood. cant put my finger on it
1815 2018-04-11 20:53:20 If you hackers are so good report the facts about USA and Russia fighting for the Oil pipeline going through Syria ? All I’m seeing is one sided hacks that are all in for Russia . Both parties are morons to believe this crap
1816 2018-04-11 20:53:11 Imagine hundreds of these trucks carrying oil, instead of pipeline?! Great alternative!  #KinderMorgan
1817 2018-04-11 20:53:08 When it comes to roast chicken, it is hard to go wrong with butter and seasoning. Over the years I have switched to olive oil instead of butter. My current seasoning mix is sage, rosemary, chopped garlic, paprika, salt and pepper.

1821 2018-04-11 20:53:02 So add in airmiles, habitat destruction, carbon release, soil degradation, from primary forests, as well as unprecedented biodiversity loss to provide a food product until recently didn't need. Palm oil is produced because cheaper to destroy #rainforests
1822 2018-04-11 20:52:41 you have to eat a lottttt of fat too :) like bacon and meat and oil and stuff. something that is really good is mct oil! look up keto diets because it seems like you’re doing something really similar but it works so well i believe in you

1826 2018-04-11 20:51:53 What would be the point? Where's the oil supposed to come from? Are you even familiar with this project? Or are you supporting it just for the sake of supporting it?
1827 2018-04-11 20:51:39 @KilduffReport Hello John. Adam here from BBC News in England. Looking to speak to you regarding today's oil price rise. Please could you follow me so I can DM you? Thanks.

1832 2018-04-11 20:50:53 There is nothing objective about this faux journalism aka propaganda.  MSM has ZERO integrity -only parrot what their Corporate sponsors want them to say. End of your democracy right there. War coverage is about making $$$ for Military Industrial Complex & BigCorp, Big Oil
1833 2018-04-11 20:50:40 I personally like a little bottle of sichuan pepper oil, to add sparingly to stuff to make it tingly, And I lob loads on if I don't want to feel my face anymore.
1834 2018-04-11 20:50:35 So glad that’s NOT in the United States.  We’d find some way to fuck it up by either polluting it, or drilling for oil in the middle of it.
1835 2018-04-11 20:50:33 @TeamCavuto Neil, Russian economy is dead with oil and gas prices too low for them to profit from production, they need a war to hide their financial problems which will include the collapse of the economy and lack of welfare system for elderly which make up half their population
1836 2018-04-11 20:50:18 Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are the main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? Well how about that.
1837 2018-04-11 20:50:16 Hi Atilla ... Does all this idiotic war mongering influence your outlook on oil in the sense that we may head higher for a few more weeks? Or is this a classic last gasp bull frenzy? I cannot believe that these idiots pulled out the war card again.

1845 2018-04-11 20:49:46 On 26th March China started an exchange so countries and people could trade oil for gold. Russia also doing oil deals that are not in dollars for a while now. The petrodollar is under major attack. Could explain US stance against these two countries.
1846 2018-04-11 20:49:40 Well shit. If this dude has sensed my presence I've gotta sharpen up my game. It may be my sulphuric odor, though I bathe with a very nice soap of tea tree oil and lemon citrus.
1847 2018-04-11 20:49:37 I didnt think they had oil cos I have heard people say thats why nobody has gone to help cos theres no gain in it for them as there was with Iraq? I could be wrong?
1848 2018-04-11 20:49:28 #twitterstake I’m curious to know your opinions on the medicinal use of CBD & THC oil. Specifically when taken orally (pill or oil form) rather than smoking. Do you feel this violates the WoW? #mormon

1857 2018-04-11 20:48:54 I put loads everywhere and it doesnt work lol. I’ve got a oil diffuser on all night too. Nothing works! Just had a kalms night  tablet which probably won’t work . I think winning the lottery and moving to a warm  island is the only answer x
1858 2018-04-11 20:48:16 @realDonaldTrump How is it the US oil industry is slow in taking up the slack by other sources? Profits.

Production and fracking was supposed to kick-in at something above $50? Multinational gouging?
1859 2018-04-11 20:48:08 @TuckerCarlson @CBNNews
US wants Assad assassinated because Russia has already been given EXCLUSIVITY to Gas & Oil rights there which upon building facilities, after eradicating terrorism there, will help finance the rebuilding of Syria & stimulate Syrian economy.
1860 2018-04-11 20:48:07 I guess you haven't been keeping up, have you?  US is a net exporter of oil and gas these days.

1862 2018-04-11 20:48:03 The true big difference is oil pricing.  But as a Trudeau once said...”just watch me”!

1866 2018-04-11 20:47:37 @OnTheMoneyCBC: Your overly anti oil guest doesn't know that a Canadian firm has invented tech that if mandated by gov & installed on all oil refineries would capture almost all of their Co2 effluent with 0 toxic chemicals Check out CST CVE it's a verified & proven solution!
1867 2018-04-11 20:47:29 I don't think so. I think that is propaganda. I don't see Iran invading anyone. I don't see Iran with bases all over the world.  I see that Iran doesn't have a BIS central bank and they have a lot oil and they don't play ball with the standard narrative of lies.
1868 2018-04-11 20:47:23 *My eyes on yours as I feel strong hands begin to massage my back, the oil warm with a slight Oriental aroma*
1869 2018-04-11 20:47:18 Hey such a stupid argument. All the urbanites r using water, gas, oil and essential goods from village. Urbanites r zero without the hard work of rural class. Gas is being explored & found from rural areas despite they r not being provided the same. Is this a justice?????????????

1874 2018-04-11 20:47:01 omg its SO easy!!! just defrost salmon (you can get it SUPER cheap at aldi if u have that around u) pat dry then cover it in flour + seasonings and then heat up 2-ish tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry it up until its flaky! easy and delicious!!!
1875 2018-04-11 20:46:56 Lol..”...salesman for the cod liver oil of entitlement reform...” That is a great line...haha.

1877 2018-04-11 20:46:51 Yes, I worked in the international oil industry for most of my life and I firmly believe that governments must take the lead on moving away from oil. The oil company I worked for foresaw the problem in 1989. No surprise then.

1881 2018-04-11 20:46:31 Weird, coz AB was mostly know as a grain producer, for a long time. Montreal's harbour was packed with cargos, waiting to be filled, since AB has no coastline to export abroad by ship. This oil image & its "patriotism" is quite new: brought forth by pounding the message.
1882 2018-04-11 20:46:21 This seems to be an advertisement for the oil and gas industry.

But if the potential of Saudi society - particularly the female half - is unlocked, it could transform the region
1894 2018-04-11 20:45:03 Very proud of @jacindaardern and @nzlabour announcing an end to oil exploration in NZ. Loud voices from the right, with vested interests in profiting of the destruction of our environment, cannot be allowed to win out - this is about our future and the future of the planet.
1895 2018-04-11 20:45:02 i just learned how to properly oil my scalp
1896 2018-04-11 20:44:55 What did you make of the oil industry arguments 1. Fuels aren’t the same as emissions; and 2. If they don’t explore they won’t find new supplies? I thought “yeah, but duh”

1901 2018-04-11 20:44:27 Of course they never mention that wind offered - and still offers - to accept same tax structure as oil and gas producers. Fail to mention that incentives for new wind have ended. Don’t mention schools and workers relying on wind. Same old ham-handed anti-wind nonsense.

1904 2018-04-11 20:44:13 Coconut oil has pretty much 0 nutritional value, kale is extremely high in nutrition. So are avocados. The things is to eat whole foods, not processed garbage like coconut oils or refined sugars.

1912 2018-04-11 20:43:38 Engineering is needed where it happens. Competition will kill it off on transport costs alone. Unless you service airplanes.
The Greens have just knifed the Taranaki region in the back. Killed off irrigation, killed off future oil revenues. All in one week.

Great friggin job!

1917 2018-04-11 20:43:19 Thanks to oil but it will run out one day. They need to diversify now before the oil runs out. Norway another oil rich country gives each citizen guaranteed money too of top of whatever money they earn. Canada an oil rich country should do the same.

1919 2018-04-11 20:43:05 got my radio fixed  just need an oil change I’m out Friday 
1920 2018-04-11 20:43:00 I'm pretty happy about the no-new-deep-sea-oil announcement, but then I saw someone buy a plastic water bottle and ask for a plastic bag for it and remembered how far we have to go as a society.
1921 2018-04-11 20:42:57 Iranian general said something similar, any attack on Iran and the saudi oilfields will be on fire within 15 mins, oil prices will shoot up, western economies will collapse
1922 2018-04-11 20:42:50 De nada.  
1923 2018-04-11 20:42:48 Hate when I come get an oil change and they start cleaning my windows, I wouldn’t mind if they didn’t do it all shitty leaving streaks all over

1928 2018-04-11 20:42:10 The Russian syndicate stops experimenting with the black oil when Vladimir Putin orders them to create 50,000 Twitter bots to spread fake news instead. This move proves to be much more harmful to the U.S. #maga #thexfiles #xfiles

1930 2018-04-11 20:42:04 Hot damn! I thought after the end of the Oil Season “Man I’m going to miss VB Isuckatpicking’s brilliance”. You’re special, you reach down, you touch a brothers heart.
1931 2018-04-11 20:41:57 I completely forgot I need an oil change, like needed it months ago probably lol
1932 2018-04-11 20:41:55 As for solutions, selling more oil and gas suggests a lack of understanding of the nature of the problem (though I’m very pro-pipeline). Selling tech, are you suggesting we have tech that we’re just not selling for some reason?
1933 2018-04-11 20:41:45 i’m gettin paid tomorrow so guess who’s buying a fucking oil diffuser!
1934 2018-04-11 20:41:44 Trump authorized lethal weapons to Ukraine. His energy policies have the added bonus of driving down Russian oil revenues. Lots more Russians killed in Syria under Trump 1/2
1935 2018-04-11 20:41:38 Media coverage of Kinder Morgan pipeline suspension has been pathetic! Expecting a fed solution to complex issue after one meeting is just dumb. Also, no analysis of KM MAYBE using protests to get out of project no longer viable due 2 low oil prices.
1936 2018-04-11 20:41:36 Not paki. Plus earned is earned. Do your math you uneducated fool. Perhaps after you get out of your sugar daddy sheiks ass and wipe the oil
1937 2018-04-11 20:41:33 oh yes, that is exactly what #JimWillie has been saying.  He calls it the Russian Rosneft Oil Consortium.

1939 2018-04-11 20:41:25 Can't be bothered to walk to the bathroom to get the olbas oil. Found the Snuffle Babe in my bed side drawer 
1940 2018-04-11 20:41:19 The thing is, renewable energy is more job-intensive than oil and gas anyway. So all we need to do is make sure enough of it is located in the communities who will lose exploration-focused jobs and offer retraining to people that want it.
1941 2018-04-11 20:41:15 When did oil change joints start asking for tips?

1945 2018-04-11 20:41:00 But it can be argued that oil will face the same decline that coal is suffering now. Maybe as early as 10 years.
The returns on a national investment through public capital (subsidy or tax cuts), career training and environmental risk are worth it in the end.

1955 2018-04-11 20:40:01 Last time I checked oil was the #1 source of primary energy in NZ and gas was #2. So, the proposal is to import all your hydrocarbons?
1956 2018-04-11 20:39:50 Have not seen the movie but my gut feelings tell me Hollywood will never make a movie about how Saudis manipulated US in Lebanon in 1970, 80 & destroyed democracy in Iran, 1954 to continue their barbaric rule, oil under Aramco

1960 2018-04-11 20:39:34 I eat it straight up, fried in coconut oil at least three times per week.  My aversion to the taste is outweighed by how I feel after eating it.  Liver is probably one of the more vile foods I eat, but I really feel much better during the days I eat liver.
1961 2018-04-11 20:39:28 Thanks for the reply! I agree that other oil crops don't damage the rainforest, but they do use more land. 1 tonne of rapeseed oil needs ~1.5 hectares of temperate land, but 1 tonne of palm oil only need ~0.25 hectares. Is tropical forest 5 x more valuable than other forests?

1964 2018-04-11 20:38:56 @TheAMShowNZ it’s stopping more oil exploration, not stopping oil jobs. When a revolution starts, it’s always the incumbents that don’t like it. This is a revolution for the future generations.

1973 2018-04-11 20:38:12 Omg..... The put the oil on a train in Alberta. The train bring the oil to BC. The oil then goes on a tanker to the world. The pipeline was a convenience. Stopping the pipeline Which is by no means dead yet ( may 31st was the deadline) does not limit the about of oil to bc

1982 2018-04-11 20:37:05 With all the BS and Fraud and adulteration occurred and occurring with Olive Oil Globally in this instance. I returned to various Ethical Farm reared and raised and carefully monitored Livestock Offerings and Duck Fat , years ago.
1983 2018-04-11 20:36:54 Bit surprised to find there is any land still left in Taranaki to offer for oil and gas. These changes are too late for us but they chart a path forward and will spare other areas from what has happened here. #TikorangiGaslands

1991 2018-04-11 20:36:22 I know that Brown increased the tax on gas here in CA. But trump is in deep with the oil companies so it is partially on him. What's the excuse for high prices elsewhere? Plus tax increases to punish blue states.

1995 2018-04-11 20:36:05 Given the government's liking for conversations, working groups and enquiries, the absence of any consultation with the oil and gas industry before this morning's announcement is astounding.
1996 2018-04-11 20:36:05 I had a friend from Saudi Arabia, his dad was a chemist for an oil company. 
When the war in Kuwait broke out, he filled me in on what the connections were. Completely blew my mind and it was all true. From that day on, my ideals turned into disillusionment.

2000 2018-04-11 20:35:48 One reason your fill-ups are costing more: The United States is shipping record amounts of oil overseas since Congress lifted a ban on most exports in 2015. US oil exports have nearly quadrupled since then.

2003 2018-04-11 20:35:39 Thanks Lesley! We've sounded our #PalmOilAlarmCall and would encourage other retailers to look carefully at the issues and consider how they can reduce demand for palm oil.

2006 2018-04-11 20:35:30 Also not sure if you heard of it but the economics of Aberdeen post oil crash has brought about the term #ArtIsTheNewOil which strikes me as a great way to reclaim heritage. Hull could do the same with fish :-)
2007 2018-04-11 20:35:20 I would just try baking it and maybe try a little bite and see how you feel! I don’t see how that would be bad as long as you don’t put a lot of oil or butter or whatever on it just like grilled chicken with a little seasoning should be fine I feel like

2019 2018-04-11 20:34:07 That's impossible, because the equation does not have the base price of oil in it
2020 2018-04-11 20:34:01 Where are the articles on car graveyards and oil spills? Oh that's right
2021 2018-04-11 20:33:58 Really a lot easier to find fraud than you think.but a bit more of a boring story. Specially trained olive oil detectors not required just a EU certified lab testing PP and canola content in what is a bland oil.If adding oleocanthal to sell cheap colza expensive...
2022 2018-04-11 20:33:56 Global demand for oil and gas is growing. NZ should be able to provide this and gain the economic benefits.
•Oil and gas are forecast to continue to make up around half the world’s energy needs by 2040.
•Natural gas demand is expected to grow 45% by 2040 (IEA).
2023 2018-04-11 20:33:55 Why is it that the entire world cares when innocent men women and children are killed in the Middle East but it happens constantly in Africa and nobody cares? My theory, the world cares cause the Middle East has a resource (oil) everybody wants. It’s sad.
2024 2018-04-11 20:33:42 So you admit it has nothing to do will oil exploration?
2025 2018-04-11 20:33:31 @theresa_may No more wars. Saudi and Israel are trying to frame Assad and capture the oil fields for #GenieEnergy. They don't own the ME and have no right to start wars. Syria is more democratic, than evil Saudi, kills in Yemen and Israel kills Palestinians

2030 2018-04-11 20:32:56 fake news in Calgary about the pro-pipeline protest.
 Oil and gas companies paid their workers to protest (much like they accused BC of)
and even though it was only in the hundreds the news reported the turnout in the thousands (opposite of what news coverage did in BC).

2032 2018-04-11 20:32:47 The BS that you believe has brainwashed you into believing Trump’s so great & that he’s “fixing” our country. I guess you don’t mind all the regulations he’s dismantled that actually protect us like dumping toxic waste into our water systems, drilling for oil in CA, but not FL

2036 2018-04-11 20:32:33 Externalized costs (toxic sludge lakes, pipeline spills, ocean spills, air pollution, downstream water pollution) should be born by producers of materials that causes the contamination. ie Oil producers and Oil transporters (regardless of method of transport)
2037 2018-04-11 20:32:24 Thank you. May I add another point: when oil goes through a refinery, its volume increases. When you do the calculations backward, you get less oil.  the difference is small, but you get more accurate calculation.
2038 2018-04-11 20:32:11 #FirePruitt #firepruitt The epa has now become a Fin joke thanks to white collar criminal Scott Pruitt. We really no longer have an epa, we have another corrupt entity working for big oil & corporations. Pruitt could give a damn about the environment.
2039 2018-04-11 20:32:04 I just buy organic unrefined coconut oil from amazon and try to get the biggest container I can because I use it for EVERYTHING! Right now I have the brand viva naturals and it’s a 54 fluid ounce container
2040 2018-04-11 20:31:52 Wrong! The extension has been #StoppedKM. Turn on the TV, read the news! Stopped! This extension will not be built and the increase in oil tankers through our waters isn't happening and won't ever happen. Extend the line that veers to the States, that's where the refineries are!
2041 2018-04-11 20:31:47 Pharma has to take some blame here. It eradicated hemp crops decades ago, then fought cannabis oil meds to cause countless addictions to opioids OxyContin and Oxycodone.
2042 2018-04-11 20:31:34 Finally a ray of hope for our future. Thank you @Iceland for banning palm oil and leading the way. @waitrose take heed. #rainforests #deforestation #Sustainability #orangutans #thismumsgoingtoiceland
2043 2018-04-11 20:31:25 @CatherineBizTV Just watched your Andrew Weaver interview. Way to keep the pressure on him and your cool. Such a condescending and pompous ass. One thing I would have closed on him with is "dude, bitumen is oil". Anyway, you exposed his agenda - he will never compromise. Bravo.
2044 2018-04-11 20:31:18 And some are opposed. Each First Nation is different. Pipelines are divisive and not just in Canada either. Running pipelines through the US is divisive there too. Oil needs to be sold better. How will it benefit the people whose land it goes through? Who pays for spills? Sell it
2045 2018-04-11 20:31:16 Perhaps isn’t rattling the oil markets enough to reach desrire effect. You know $70 a gallon would be pretty sweet for Putin.. and Saudis, US.

Constant gyrations in the global stock markets can earn a pretty penny too, buying/shorting depending on whats said via Tweet or leaked.

2051 2018-04-11 20:30:43 Very true, in spite of the abundance of Crude Oil in Akwa Ibom d state is diversifying, they are currently building a coconut oil refinery and plans are being made to build a Deep sea port in Oron
2052 2018-04-11 20:30:39 Coconut oil really isn’t for me

2054 2018-04-11 20:30:18 Telling a pregnant lady to use coconut oil to avoid stretch marks is equivalent to telling someone with acne to wash their face. Do y'all really know nothing about genetics and hormones?

2057 2018-04-11 20:30:12 It's also bad for you since it contains high amount of saturated fat. Use olive oil instead. I have never been in Iceland Food store before, but after this video I will. Well done!:)

2064 2018-04-11 20:29:44 Relax. Read Sun Tsu. Check the value of the Ruble and the trading prices of Russian Corps. Check the value of the Syrian Pound. Compare to USD. Oil is indexed in USD (petrodollar system). Who backs Putin in Russia? When will the Truman SF arrive? $$$ = Leverage.

2070 2018-04-11 20:29:15 Do the Saudis need the oil price to go up?   Will the oil price go up?  I smell a rat.
2071 2018-04-11 20:29:14 Yes.But still where are pesticide residue tests for all edible oils?.If olive fruitfly doing damage Polyphenols drop research suggests.Low PP a good indication Extra virgin oil is fraudulent too with short shelf life.Very fruity but no healthy throat tickling bitterness.

We got the oil
We got the gas

2078 2018-04-11 20:28:33 To me, there’s something off about this close friendship . I don’t know what. Yes I know it may have started when he was an oil exec working on nigerian oil projects. But I won’t be surprised if we find out decades from now, that he is an MI6 agent, ‘working’ our President.
2079 2018-04-11 20:28:24 Dude, #TransMountain charges for the flow of dilbit through it's pipelines.  If the demand for dilbit decreases because there are other lower cost forms of oil available then the FLOW through the TM pipes decreases. - Hence TM's PROFITS DECREASE.

2088 2018-04-11 20:27:43 he mentioned that a lot of traders are gravitating to oil as the geopolitical trade

#1 Oil

#2 Gold in our view as other geopolitical trade
2089 2018-04-11 20:27:42 Proud of Patrick Pouyanne who made history in the World of oil and gas
2090 2018-04-11 20:27:39 It's almost like the most brilliant thing we did was force all oil to be traded in US dollars which effectively created a global reserve currency.

Then it's almost like the dumbest thing a country could do would be to attack us when their economy depends on oil.
2091 2018-04-11 20:27:36 Why would Putin bother when Syria has virtually won? There are good geopolitical reasons to keep Assad weak e.g. Oil pipeline and reduce Russian influence. If Russia can't defend Syria that's a strong message. I'm convinced it's another cooked up conflict by US deep state.
2092 2018-04-11 20:27:25 TED talks are like oil changes for your brain
2093 2018-04-11 20:27:21 Wrong again, the 7th phase of the expansion is to the Westridge Marine Terminal is about increasing capacity for the sole purpose of increasing oil tanker shipments by 7 times. If it were possible in increase loading without the extension, they'd be already doing it. #StoppedKM

2107 2018-04-11 20:25:48 of course! This stuff does seems to be similar to mummification goo. Actually it seems to contain very little resin despite constant descriptions as "resin" or "resinous". More often it's beeswax and plant oil. But that doesn't explain the blackness... More work to be done!

2119 2018-04-11 20:24:55 It's almost as if the "Taranaki is doomed" sayers think that with the end of oil & gas, that's it, we will just somehow stop consuming all that energy, & the economy will be forced to shrink to 25% of it's current size.

Yeah, nah!

Energy consumption will increase, not decrease.

2122 2018-04-11 20:24:47 Amidst world crisis over the interests of the US and those of her allies in Syria, why does msm have a total embargo on discussion of the question of Israel’s taking Syrian oil & her illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights in defiance of international law?

2124 2018-04-11 20:24:44 Sunshine...always a good thing from a PR maven.Good to see @tommuellerX Book on Olive Oil fraud getting some reach. Now let's hope a really good investigative journalist looks at pesticide use in EU and link to xyella fastidiosa or dieback disease.
2125 2018-04-11 20:24:39 Hi there, oil and gas shill group. I’m only engaging with this tweet to cost you more money. Kindly get fucked!
2126 2018-04-11 20:24:37 All the great sides with football heritage have come back from 3-0 down, it's a shame when you're funded on oil money you can't buy some.
2127 2018-04-11 20:24:26 #pnpcbc Oil and gas bought themselves the BC Lib govt and tried to force pipelines on BC imo. Process was rigged, rerouted thru city and provincial Parks, much policy written by the industry's NEB. Manipulated some Bands into signing secretive deals while most oppose. #bcpoli
2128 2018-04-11 20:24:00 Because they are clueless? Along with the fact that they don't care about facts nor reality so long as they keep AB oil landlocked for their Foreign Funded Interest groups.
2129 2018-04-11 20:23:55 I only fuck with the burrito if they make it with mayo, mustard, h p, lettuce, onion, tomato, oil and seasoning

2132 2018-04-11 20:23:44 I think Bin Laden is dead, Isis is in shambles, We don’t need their oil. Iraq is stable, Let France and Germany deal with the Chemical Atrocities
2133 2018-04-11 20:23:35 Waiting on an oil change 
2134 2018-04-11 20:23:34 Business it is. Oil is up. Trump should soon brag about the Dow. And actually, this time, it might be because of him and his tweets.
2135 2018-04-11 20:23:29 Y don’t they just put a tariff on all his oil and get the European countries to do it tell them we wilhook u up w oil or is it that different oil they use in Europe anyways
2136 2018-04-11 20:23:28 Our current leadership want to be socially like Scandinavian countries, however those countries got there with lots of money and resources - like oil. 

You can't make social policies without money, and you can't keep getting your money from tax when we have resources available.
2137 2018-04-11 20:23:16 I’m sure oil & gas men in Oklahoma City appreciate you roping them in with poor put-upon farmers
2138 2018-04-11 20:23:14 That ACT party sure is amazing. 
It stands up for the Tobacco Industry.
Stands up for the sugar industry.
Stands up for oil exploration. 
Stands up for privilege and exclusivity. 

We get all that & David Seymour for approx. $1 million + per year. 
Isn't the NZ Tax Payer lucky?
2139 2018-04-11 20:23:08 Many people say that for Russia war in middle East is good becasue oil price. ( somehow is true)
2140 2018-04-11 20:23:06 Still so discombobulating hearing good news out of Govt. Hit & Run inquiry & the end of oil & gas exploration. Smashing it @NZGreens!
2141 2018-04-11 20:22:58 Ya I am willing to bet the police and doctors working shift work, the boys in the oil patch pulling long hard days or all night during road bans would be happy to have the rough 24/7 job of traveling with the family and embarrassing Canada cough India cough
2142 2018-04-11 20:22:57 Now buy crude oil - it's war time. What a world...

2146 2018-04-11 20:22:21 Yeah but she’d have buried some scandals and put the local elections off. AND got a little oil. Can’t see Trump giving her much of the bounty.
2147 2018-04-11 20:22:06 I’m ridiculously bad at keeping oil in my car 
2148 2018-04-11 20:21:59 And there noo @ECGghOfficial put off our light at galaxy oil @shikome_1 @addojunr #JoyUCL
2149 2018-04-11 20:21:54 Oppose both. This insane agenda of destroying Middle Eastern Countries for oil and pipelines has to stop.
2150 2018-04-11 20:21:42 Dear Twitterverse: what commercial breweries are using olive oil in place of wort aeration?
2151 2018-04-11 20:21:38 It’s supposed to be 80° tomorrow and I can not wait to lather myself with tanning oil and sit in the sun lol
2152 2018-04-11 20:21:36 Israel had oil #uakronwh
2153 2018-04-11 20:21:35 we having some fun just watching wishing it was us covering you in baby oil and taking a film for ourselves
2154 2018-04-11 20:21:34 why would he take that pledge? some big oil company might then decide not to bribe him... the outrage!!!
2155 2018-04-11 20:21:28 Bolton orchestrated the illegal Iraq War. There were NO weapons of mass destruction. We could have ended homelessness with the money Bush wasted in Iraq to privatize oil. Trump said the Iraq War was stupid. Now he hires Iraq Bolton.
2156 2018-04-11 20:21:27 Great that some companies are making a stand against palm oil
2157 2018-04-11 20:21:24 If the money we get from oil drilling was so good, why didn't nurses and teachers get good pay rises in the last 9 years?
2158 2018-04-11 20:21:05 Absolutely. Just like the info companies initially release on oil spills. Oh, it was just a couple of barrels... um, by the way it’s now up to 100 Olympic-sized pools worth. Our bad.
2159 2018-04-11 20:21:02 And which ones are that? Breaking matrimonial vows. Polluting land and and eatercwith oil pipielines or coal. Screwing education by putting a person in ed who never attended public school. Or taking away all climate change laws. Which makes him more dangerous
2160 2018-04-11 20:20:51 The world is flooded with oil, we even have backwardation right now. This is when the futures price is below the spot price for a particular commodity. Geopolitical tension are definately a catalyst for crude right now. $USO, $SCO, $UCO are all in play.
2161 2018-04-11 20:20:50 روووووووووووووعههه
2162 2018-04-11 20:20:44 So explain to me why, with all these gifts to oil co's, gas is more expensive??? Trickle-on economics at its finest.
2163 2018-04-11 20:20:27 Any increase in Alberta's oil production will add to the world FF capacity and not replace imports _ It boil down to this : F F Development HAS TO STOP «« NOW »» or else its cutting the branch humanity is sitting on ! #CollectifSuicide
2164 2018-04-11 20:20:26 You know that Liverpool are THE English European team. Man City just opportunist oil imposters.

Great show as usual, has anyone thought about doing a segment avoit the new oil at Volunteer Pharmacy?  I have a lot of joint pain!  Thanks!
2168 2018-04-11 20:20:16 and what are there vehicles, atv's and of course their boats to catch fish run on clean Canadain made oil and gasoline, stuff you people never use ha ha ha ha ha ha ha he he
2169 2018-04-11 20:20:10 news I saw was the bombing or missiles near the oil fields.  Any unrest will send it higher,   Get cease fire of some sort and get out of the way so it doesn't crash on you like of roof of Trump tower.  IMHO

2173 2018-04-11 20:19:52 I've seen this destruction first hand in Borneo too & it is heart breaking to drive for your after hour; alongside nothing but palm oil fields. 
Deforestation & the impact on the animals is unimaginable. Well done for making that change. Fantastic news.
2174 2018-04-11 20:19:38 Gas 136.4 today. Up 12 cents a liter since this morning.Did the price of oil go up. Nope it dropped. Something happen at a refinery. Nope nothing in the news. Did trump put a tariff on gas.  Maybe. Did the liberals add a new tax. More than likely. Bankrupting Ontario
2175 2018-04-11 20:19:29 There is no way it's efficient to keep exploring when we already know about four to six times more oil than we can safely burn, Sam. We need to be talking about how we convince them not to extract all of that, and frankly I doubt price signals will cover it rn.
2176 2018-04-11 20:19:28 Funny girlfriend works for a oil related company was told to go with 35 other employees paid to this lol 17 of them went home! Pro or anti all is being done wrong!
2177 2018-04-11 20:19:27 I found jesus he's changing my oil my Mechanic's name is Jesus just in case anyone is looking for a good mechanic named Jesus 
2178 2018-04-11 20:19:24 Cameron Madgewick said this morning we should stop emissions not oil exploration. It’s like telling smokers to stop smoking but encouraging tobacco companies to keep producing cigarettes #climate #EndOil
2179 2018-04-11 20:19:24 If only they knew
2180 2018-04-11 20:19:20 Oil was up today because of #Trump's tweets. Russia and Saudi Arabia are happy.
2181 2018-04-11 20:19:16 All eventual Marine And Coastal Area title holders and marine Customary Rights holders need to take this opportunity to *try* put protection orders on to prevent future govt reversals on oil and gas exploration.
2182 2018-04-11 20:19:08 It's all about Iran. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria etc. Iran has 2nd largest gas and 4th largest oil reserves in the world. I've been to Tehran and Esfahan, they're lovely people and completely misrepresented. 25,000 Jews live in Tehran, you never hear that.
2183 2018-04-11 20:19:08 Very inappropriate day chosen by @jacindaardern to make this announcement about oil when tens of thousands of folk in the city she lives in cannot charge their electric cars.
2184 2018-04-11 20:19:03 Enbridge underwater Line 5 oil pipelines damaged by ship
2185 2018-04-11 20:19:02 Shocker. Guess who bought oil certs on Monday?
2186 2018-04-11 20:19:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2187 2018-04-11 20:18:58 New Zealand is a small producer on the world stage making up 0.014% of global oil supply. If we #endoil and stop exploration and future production that would easily be made up by other markets. Stopping production here won’t increase prices either, because NZ is a price taker.
2188 2018-04-11 20:18:54 From Ororo to palm oil 
2189 2018-04-11 20:18:43 The US is only interested in the oil pipeline. That's what their Wall St backers want. They only care about making money. They don't give a rats rear end about the people of Syria (or anywhere else, for that matter). In fact, they are responsible for the war. #disastercapitalism
2190 2018-04-11 20:18:41 Sammm that newest oil painting is so good. I see you killing the backgrounds 
2191 2018-04-11 20:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2192 2018-04-11 20:18:39 Europeans also do things like drill their oil and sell it on the open market.  Look at Norway.

2198 2018-04-11 20:17:26 Which ever way you look at it, it’s all about oil and the dollar. Is that worth dying for? #NoMoreWar #VotePeace #SupportJeremyCorbyn
2199 2018-04-11 20:17:22 For the most part, they are basically the same kind of oil. Kerosene is quite often referred to as paraffin in the UK, East and South Africa. Kerosene is a term typically used in the US.
2200 2018-04-11 20:17:12 EIA projects that oil demand will increase for the next 22 years. We should be the world's #1 supplier of that oil, NOT Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Saudi. How much do you think those countries care about human, much less environmental rights?

2204 2018-04-11 20:16:58 Trevor what can pple do with Zanu-PF govt arrogance?? Let’s be honest. All change this time is coming through the ballot. And only then can we start challenging the former govt members. We are not all kids who celebrate profusely for having made a Castor oil plant whistle. Noooo.
2205 2018-04-11 20:16:49 Just as long as oil, gas, tech and pharma CEOs are required to as well.

2209 2018-04-11 20:16:25 The west think Russia need to be taken down a peg. Their military bases will upset the balance in the region in favour of Iran which is not in the wests interest not to mention oil pipeline. Watch out for more false flags. Gassing not sufficient to take public with them.
2210 2018-04-11 20:16:23 @NZMorningReport if people working in oil and gas haven't worked out that their days in that industry are numbered, they haven't been paying attention for the past decade or so.
2211 2018-04-11 20:16:20 All the newshub bluster this morning  re oil drilling seems to boil down to how dare the govt do something that the @NZGreens campaigned for....
2212 2018-04-11 20:16:14 Thanks for your question. We’ve asked all of our trusted suppliers to fill out paperwork to verify that our new recipes won’t contain palm oil. We always test all of our foods to make sure they meet our high standards, and this is no different for our new palm oil free products
2213 2018-04-11 20:16:12 I think bread water, shelf safe milk, butter, sugar n flour, oil etc maybe a necessary run soon. Make sure needs like meds n oxygen are filled. Batteries etc..things that go thru Kitty's head on days like this

2224 2018-04-11 20:15:36 What do you think to products that state to be certified by the RSPO and use 'sustainable palm oil'? Or is that a way of trying to sell it to consumers that it's okay to use?! Thanks for sharing the story

2230 2018-04-11 20:14:42 Mr. Paul the politics in the FBI is both republican and Democrat. Trump haters are every where not because he is a “Republican” but because he is a bad bully, con artist. You are smart. You know you are supporting a snake oil salesman to ruin our country.
2231 2018-04-11 20:14:33 Companies with PII have paid lawyers millions, of not billions over the past 18-19 years figuring out how to legally monetize your life’s patterns and interests. It ain’t just FB and it ain’t gonna stop. As JP Getty III (?) said,, IP is the oil of the 21st Century.
2232 2018-04-11 20:14:27 Do you believe Putin kills his political enemies? Do you believe he sent militias into the Ukraine to take over its oil and gas reserves? Do you believe Assad gassed civilians a week after the US said they were going to pull out of Syria and Assad met with Putin and Turkey?
2233 2018-04-11 20:14:22 You think ending oil exploration when we already have discovered more reserves than we can safely burn is "heavy handed?" I would have called it light touch, myself.
2234 2018-04-11 20:14:17 Ginger essential oil is a vibrational match for this truth. Its properties affect the subtle body to aid in releasing the victim mentality so we can become empowered in our responsibility in chosing our destiny.

Anyone who is depressed and has no contraindication to taking magnesium, vitamin D and fish oil supplements should consider doing so. I also think maca, a plant-based supplement can be helpful. Your doctor may have other suggestions, too
2237 2018-04-11 20:13:55 The other republicans will just have to struggle along without him. All they have to do is accept 100% of their campaign funds from the NRA, sell their souls to the NRA if they haven’t already done so, then skim off the profits from the oil drilling in our parklands.

2240 2018-04-11 20:13:47 Let’s see how fast i can clean and do laundry and wash my car and get an oil change i say not fast at all but we’ll see
2241 2018-04-11 20:13:40 All the easy to extract domestic oil has already been extracted. Places like ANWR are so expensive to extract that they would actually need subsidies instead of paying royalties. Saudi oil is not just plentiful, but cheap to get.
2242 2018-04-11 20:13:37 The market always has people who guess, think, plan, forecast, wrong. If you sell oil now, thinking the curve is telling you it is about to drop, you're not reading the data properly. You might end up being right, but that doesn't mean your rationale was right. Big difference.
2243 2018-04-11 20:13:32 right now (not always) but short interest rates, especially the back end of the #yieldcurve can be looked at as long volatility.  The #stockmarket goes down, #oil goes higher, and #vix trades higher.   Don't get caught in the global trap
2244 2018-04-11 20:13:27 Should have asked for and settled for nothing less than 7% GPT. Instead of multiple targets, go after the one and only that can afford to fix all the ills at once. Big oil isn't going anywhere, especially now since they got another sweet deal. As I have said elsewhere the golden

2246 2018-04-11 20:13:25 Good one. And now we must look and work very hard at reducing our need for oil and fossil fuel. I hope all you people who have been getting the good money out of Fonterra have made good use of it & not just justified huge debt ~which is what Fonterra has done
2247 2018-04-11 20:13:25 Other Countries including some in the commonwealth have committed atrocities so why haven’t Trump and Teresa sent in missiles to them, oh wait there’s OIL in Serbia. It’s like Iraq is happening again. Wonder if it’s really about Arms sales
2248 2018-04-11 20:13:14 Most of them are on going. Plus, our reserve is almost $50bn (from less than $30bn) & this has been achieved all when oil is half of when you & Patience Jonathan were leading us to the rocks. @APCNigeria shld get people who will always remind some "useful idiots" what they did.
2249 2018-04-11 20:13:13 Yet we are all guilty in some way of damaging our Earth. I heat my home with oil and wood and run 2 cars.

2257 2018-04-11 20:12:25 What a stupid idea. Build a refinery if you are going to spend taxpayers dollars, then at least there will be more than 50 full time jobs and the profits won't go to a Texas Oil giant.
2258 2018-04-11 20:12:21 I'm all for saving the planet but, thanks to my soya allergy, palm oil is one of the only lecithins that allows me to eat anything these days.
2259 2018-04-11 20:12:10 So, when Rabbit was gone Turtle and Lizard kept working away and one day an amazing thing happened while digging the field. They struck oil! They were rich! They immediately began transforming their lives. They built a huge mansion. They had a tennis court. A swimming pool!
2260 2018-04-11 20:12:06 Also known as “corporate subsidies”, like $37.5 BILLION/ year to big oil. But nobody seems concerned with that. Only making sure kids of poor people go hungry. Because we ALL know that minimum wage is enough to support a family, especially ones headed by women.

2262 2018-04-11 20:12:02 i have roughnecks in my family. i understand.

i'm suggesting a bias. oil is important in alberta. if climate change denial comes from anywhere, it’s most often from those most effected by it (ff industry).

2264 2018-04-11 20:11:37 So they own enginnering firms you say?

So when we replace oil and gas with for example - Solar & Wind, you know technologies that need, errrr, engineering firms to help manufacture & service their infrastructure... where do you think that will come from?
2265 2018-04-11 20:11:35 Quite so. Tell that to the retailers whose livelihoods depend on the wages paid to those who work for companies supporting the oil and gas industry. There may only be a thousand or so working DIRECTLY in the industry, but there are many thousands more who depend on it.

2285 2018-04-11 20:09:19 I have a couple of friends in Taranaki who own businesses which provide engineering support to the oil and gas industry. They employ real people, to whom they pay real wages. What will happen to them when the work dries up, as it inevitably will?

2288 2018-04-11 20:09:06 I really do believe that we are seeing the early stages of the breakdown of 'civilization'. Resources like oil are getting short and the 'bigger' countries are worried.

2296 2018-04-11 20:08:23 When oil prices bottomed the contango was pretty steep, which is consistent with my view that markets don't consistently have structural flaws. The first level interaction that you're discussing premium to store vs sell alone influences prices. The process is reflexive.
2297 2018-04-11 20:08:13 Same as the Weapons mass destruction in Iraq, they just done that to thieve oil, million plus gallons of it, we paid for the bombs then bought the oil off them too.
2298 2018-04-11 20:08:09 Thank you, Colin.      What about this fact: in some regions, ALL busses were running on CNG before they were replaced with electric? Therefore, there was No replacement of oil.
2299 2018-04-11 20:08:04 Oil flying, good for both Russia and USA hmmm, plus those bombs are nearing best before date so time to use them up and resupply. The game is bent.
2300 2018-04-11 20:07:56 That’s funny for decades Iran used massive oil tankers to ship oil from the Persian (Iranian) Gulf. When did they start using camels to carry it across Syria? Seems a backward step to me but you seem to have it covered!
2301 2018-04-11 20:07:53 You just need a pet dog that gives really sad eyes. Then everyone will go: Awwww - and never know the truth! Cause you know humans are robots and just need oil changes, right?

Will need to remember to bring this up at the next super secret Twitter Nazi meeting.
2323 2018-04-11 20:06:26 Yes, our military firing on unarmed men, women and children in the service of an American oil project is clearly the way to go.

Then complains when me heavy-handed second-best solutions like no more oil exploration are done instead
2328 2018-04-11 20:06:21 Good question, the answer lies in addressing the issue at the right angle. Since oil and gas is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an Emissions Trading Scheme  like we have)....

Profit for the US to establish a military base.

Assad is sitting on a gold mine sort of speak.
And it's the Russians, China, Iran that are most likely to profit

2342 2018-04-11 20:05:06 first time down in Wellington for ages and the government announces no new offshore oil and gas exploration... maybe I should come down more often...

2343 2018-04-11 20:05:02 In contango you're paying to store oil, hence the tail price. It is isn't a $ prediction, but rather a premium to spot. Backwardation says no premium paid to store, rather a premium to sell. Neither offer prediction beyond spot. Premium or discount to spot.
2344 2018-04-11 20:04:55 That's ok. If Donald Dump decides that dropping bombs is a good idea (Which I'm assuming he does) Then we'll have problems. I mean if I was holding EC at the moment I'd double down EOD today. Lol loves war and war loves oil.
2345 2018-04-11 20:04:45 We will just import the oil.

2351 2018-04-11 20:04:07 Perhaps our recent quest to become green has already pressured the oil states to promote the violence which in turn focus's us on war (oil) and not on furthering green tech?

good luck
2366 2018-04-11 20:02:43 4. #pnpcbc So many areas neglected by tight control of BC msm. You could bring on ignored reporters doing the real issues. Less Chamber of Commerce types soaked in oil 3. Diff perspective than Alberta's. We've got a lot of lip service in the past 16 yrs #bcpoli
2367 2018-04-11 20:02:43 Its nice outside today. And i really wouldnt mind going can hunting except that i have no car once again.

Really can't wait for my brother to get off his butt and pay for an oil temperature sensor for his car....oh wait, it wont happen
2368 2018-04-11 20:02:42 Y’all get your feelings hurt over men who don’t even know how to do an oil change lmao.
2369 2018-04-11 20:02:34 OIL DIFF: 5.51 -> 5.48
2370 2018-04-11 20:02:33 Started work at 3, Spilt oil all over the place and down me. 
Burnt my hand. 
And now someone who I haven’t seen in 3 months has just come to the bar to tell me I’ve gained weight. 

Oreet.
2371 2018-04-11 20:02:22 you know perhaps just perhaps if we build a pipe within a pipe and reverse flow them so each pipe flow opposite to the other we can pump oil to quebec harbors and pump shit back jt will go for that
2372 2018-04-11 20:02:12 Lol you was also watching umar johnson and thought tea tree oil was the cure for cancer.
2373 2018-04-11 20:02:10 Just finished the Convention on Oil & Gas Payments to Nigerian Government Entities @communityParkNG w/@NRGInstitute@haskeus  @BudgITng @EiENigeria @PremiumTimesng @ZiraJQ @teewai_toyin . V. exciting to see so many Nigerian citizens analyzing payments to governments data.
2374 2018-04-11 20:02:05 The US is only interested in the oil pipeline. That's what their Wall St backers want. They only care about making money. They don't give a rats rear end about the people of Syria (or anywhere else, for that matter). In fact, they are responsible for the war. #disastercapitalism
2375 2018-04-11 20:02:00 Which of course, Putin does not want as he sells Russian gas and oil to the EU.

2378 2018-04-11 20:01:52 I work at a Christian coffee shop and this old man walks in asking is we sold CBP oil lmao
2379 2018-04-11 20:01:51 What does russia have?  Paper tiger.  All it would take is @realDonaldTrump asking OPEC to increase oil production and Russia goes into immediate recession.  Quit scaring people, menace!
2380 2018-04-11 20:01:46 David, you'll have to deal with the fact that the reason you feel left behind is that you were dumb enough to rely on status quo. That's why you love these snake oil salesmen and what they peddle. Do something with your life or be another cuckoo to make fun of in History classes.
2381 2018-04-11 20:01:44 Then thank God most sensible people saw through Alex Salmonds its "oor oil" myth, he even tried to get Scotland To be like Norway model, Norway came back  and said scram ya Bam.

2384 2018-04-11 20:01:30 Assholes told me I needed an engine flush on a very old car once..  proceed to screw off the rusted connection hose and when they attempted to screw it back on they relalized they broke it.  Told me they wouldn’t charge me for the flush but wanted to charge me for the oil chabge?
2385 2018-04-11 20:01:29 We'll need increased response to oil spills.

2393 2018-04-11 20:00:52 US already got cheap oil from Iraq for the food for oil program.

And after it invaded Iraq, all the oil was auctioned to Russians and Norwegians.

Oil was not the reason for the Iraq invasion.
2394 2018-04-11 20:00:49 Name one replacement for oil. Oh, and for coal. And natural gas while at it.
2395 2018-04-11 20:00:43 Oil price was $100. That is why we pay subsidy then so that  affect the cost of fuel won’t be to expensive when Oil was $35 dollar we should be paying les for pms but the roughs increased it to 145 instead of lowering it and were still paying huge subsidy.
2396 2018-04-11 20:00:36 Cannabis oil would help his cognitive functions. He should get on that.
2397 2018-04-11 20:00:33 Everyone should contact their congressman about the continuing increase in the price of gas. The oil companies are exporting crude oil, gas and other petroleum products while  raising our gas prices. This needs to stop immediately. The oil reserves belong to the American people.

2401 2018-04-11 20:00:12 A mild dose of risk aversion crept back into markets after President Trump’s tweeted missile threats against Syria and Russia. The S&P500 is down 0.6%, gold is up 0.9%, oil is up 1.2% to a three-year high, and bond yields are slightly lower.

2406 2018-04-11 19:59:44 I calculated the capacity of an oil tanker full of µSD cards and it was several orders of magnitude larger than any estimate of the current world digital storage total. 
It’s probably gone up since I think 200GB were the max at the time

2411 2018-04-11 19:59:14 @KoinangeJeff kindly ask John Ngumu what informed their decision to move the loading of oil by tankers from Nakuru Pipeline to Eldoret by exporters? @citizentvkenya

2413 2018-04-11 19:59:01 El dueño de un multimedio local, que la pasada semana publicó que una "Criatura" asechaba a Totoras matando perros, cuando se trataba de una noticia falsa, y una foto montada con photoshop quiere venir a darnos lecciones a los periodistas sobre noticias falsas sobre OIL.
2414 2018-04-11 19:58:57 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead. This is called Carbon Leakage.

2422 2018-04-11 19:58:25 Saudi prince backed up oil tankers full of money to their bank for a world title change and everyone to be there.
2423 2018-04-11 19:58:20 Global demand for oil and gas is growing. NZ should provide this and gain the economic benefits.
•Oil and gas are forecast to continue to make up around half the world’s energy needs by 2040.
•Natural gas demand is expected to grow 45% by 2040 (IEA).

2431 2018-04-11 19:57:53 When oil prices bottomed there was a lot of contango in the oil board. Oil subsequently rose. The back of the curve moved far less. Storing oil is uneconomic with a backwardated board. How are these things not relevant drivers?
2432 2018-04-11 19:57:49 It's like Helen's - saucier, less oil & more soy; but good. No szechuan peppercorns, sadly.
2433 2018-04-11 19:57:45 I was only supposed to get a oil change , my car detailed and go shopping BUT instead I had to get new freaking tires and my timing gotten thrown off and I am behind  what a long day and it’s only 3
2434 2018-04-11 19:57:39 We are almost approaching 100 percent energy independence and can get oil from others now 
2435 2018-04-11 19:57:29 So I assume all those pundits who keep bleating on about how the @NZGreens should stick to “the environment and green stuff” will now be celebrating and giving credit to them for ending oil exploration in our waters right?

Right?..

2436 2018-04-11 19:57:29 Yeah. Through the worst. Still feel very shaky. But I know it will go eventually. The essential oil today was lemongrass. It helped a lot. I have vanilla too. And coconut hand cream. All of the scents are calming for me. But the lemongrass is good for bringing me back to now.

2442 2018-04-11 19:56:35 Nah the oil is...
2443 2018-04-11 19:56:26 $ can be earned as long as one live !!!
$ never earn or purchase life to live yes only can purchase comfort but only when you live !!!
Oil and gas in exchange get $ but when live only !!!
2444 2018-04-11 19:56:20 At home, we made these with dried apricots (on my update list). Pantry options have really bloomed—so it’s wonderful to rethink this sweet with ingredients such as coconut oil, coconut nectar, and sea salt as I did. But the Bergdorf Goodman box is charmingly irreplaceable.
2445 2018-04-11 19:56:13 Castor oil really works FYI
2446 2018-04-11 19:56:10 Mayor Holdom certainly does NOT speak for me on oil and gas. What a knee-jerk reaction that deliberately ignores the detail and goes for the headline.
2447 2018-04-11 19:55:59 Thanks for this Will. I didn't know much about sustainable palm oil and naively assumed boycotting was the best decision but not so! Great to see another perspective on the problem.
2448 2018-04-11 19:55:54 I also used to have green tea with lemon and a teaspoon of coconut oil every morning. It was gross but gave me so much energy

2452 2018-04-11 19:55:15 I though it came in 3 strengths. 3 different prices. However, We must have bought cooking oil because none made a difference
2453 2018-04-11 19:55:13 We should impose extreme financial and economic sanctions on all the countries and individuals supporting the rebel groups in Syria.. Freeze Assets, Bank Accounts... Blockade their ports so they cant export oil!..  The war would have been over in a week.
2454 2018-04-11 19:54:42 Hahahah. Looks like a lot of minerals and oil products to make this panels to me. Never seen one pice of Grass or a twig or seaweed in the panel building picture. And the green peace mark on the bottom sealed the deal. #moron. Funny you never said anything about the sewage.
2455 2018-04-11 19:54:34 Basically the oil decision says that if your industry has to be sacrificed to control the climate your gone
The rock solid fact that NZ as ·06% of world population has no impact on world climate doesn't matter
That temps have been flatlining fo 20yrs doesn't matter
You're gone

2458 2018-04-11 19:54:29 #JKLive @KoinangeJeff @citizentvkenya ask John Ngumi what happened to the oil refinery.
2459 2018-04-11 19:54:28 Sir the reason nigeria pay subsidy on petrol is to cushion the price of petrol WHEN OIL PRICE GO UP. In essence the more oil price goes up the more subsidy we pay.when .when this relic increased fuel 145 we should have been buying fuel at 145 cos the price of crude was low.1
2460 2018-04-11 19:54:27 2. Lack of awareness in Canada about #BCpoli False narratives coming from Canada's Oil and Gas Alberta Cons. Bullying has gone on decades. Focus on why 2013 elxn gave BCLibs (Cons) when polling NDP majority. What aggregate co's helped? Chinese propaganda donors to BCLibs. #pnpcbc
2461 2018-04-11 19:54:26 A squeaky wheel eventually gets the oil!
2462 2018-04-11 19:54:24 I love the way the Govt has backed National & Act into a corner over off shore oil exploration.  If those two parties say they'll overturn the decision to ban it, they will show the world they couldn't get a stuff about the environment. 
#EndOil
2463 2018-04-11 19:54:21 The U.S. foundations need to be held accountable to make amends for the controversy & gridlock that their “Tar Sands Campaign” has manufactured in order to keep crude oil from western Canada out of overseas markets. This just keeps Canada over a barrel. Doesn’t help climate.

2467 2018-04-11 19:53:59 Right now the global EV fleet is displacing around 270,000 barrels of oil per day. 230,000 of that is e-buses, most of which are in China.
2468 2018-04-11 19:53:57 Hey Barb, asking since youre Social Manager. Any reason no one from Rt has said anything about the outrage going on with your newest sponsor being literal snake oil ED pill hawkers?
2469 2018-04-11 19:53:55 We didn’t go to sleep until 4:30 last night, I woke up at 8:30 & actually went to school, got my oil changed, grocery shopped, came home & cleaned the whole house, & now I’m on my way to the gym.
WHO IS MISS PRODUCTIVE?!?!?!?
2470 2018-04-11 19:53:47 Or building refineries and sell the gasoline in Canada instead of exporting the tar sand oil out of the country would be a good solution.
2471 2018-04-11 19:53:43 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It's such a con, cause chaos in middle east, bump the price of oil. CHA CHING CHA CHING$$$ Some are more wise after Libya, Iraq so on.
2472 2018-04-11 19:53:32 Can’t recommend CBD oil enough. Makes a huge difference!
2473 2018-04-11 19:53:24 Why it was a disaster, now #Bush Family is the owner of many oil wells in the region that you conquered for him and obviously now #Trump want his share. A new war is coming for sure.

2485 2018-04-11 19:52:12 Just sit down here and talk all you want. Don't put it on FB though, Camb Analyt will try to sell you snake oil to cure it!
2486 2018-04-11 19:52:06 Really no place left for our families. We have plenty of nice land in America.  I bet you support the continued war in Syria so we can establish a oil pipeline there. Point is we have plenty of oil here that has been off limits for political reasons. So why not drill it?
2487 2018-04-11 19:52:02 Calgary unemployment & oil prices going down is a thing to deal with, alot of in country things to moment to moment adjust toward future end.
2488 2018-04-11 19:52:01 I’m in a waiting room scenario and there is a person loudly talking about his penis medications and what color each of his three Rav 4’s are *in detail* to perfect strangers 

... I really need to learn how to change my oil. #headdown.

2496 2018-04-11 19:51:08 The oil change lobby I’m currently in is very quiet. I just tooted and nobody was around to here it. Feeling #blessed
2497 2018-04-11 19:51:06 Newsflash..his wealth came from oil ..Sherlock Holmes not required
2498 2018-04-11 19:51:06 ON NOW: @Megan_Woods discusses govt ending oil & gas exploration permits. Permits out there that got to 2046, she says. "This is a very deliberate, long-term managed plan."
2499 2018-04-11 19:51:00 He sounds like Owen the Oil Rig when he says that.
2500 2018-04-11 19:50:59 The one in the depths of an old ship passing up buckets of oil on a rope to a bunch of sea faring evil people.
2501 2018-04-11 19:50:53 This happened a week ago & nothing on the news so far? May have something to do with not being able to pin this on a country like America or big wealthy oil distributor. Small countries & small companies don't sell the outrage to the general public who want someone big to blame.
2502 2018-04-11 19:50:52 Arab Gulf States are taking advantages of Somalia long time unstable Situations and on top of it violating International Laws in open air Due to their Oil wealth that legitimate every  wrong or right actions! #Somaliland #Somalia
2503 2018-04-11 19:50:48 Yeah, heard spokesperson on 5live yesterday morning say they’re replacing palm oil with; “sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and good, old-fashioned lard.”
2504 2018-04-11 19:50:45 Genie oil company was the First thing I googled when Prita Patel got caught with her hand in the cookie jar out there. If it wasn't uk foreign policy then it had to be a Murdock foreign policy
2505 2018-04-11 19:50:32 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
2506 2018-04-11 19:50:32 I want an  with salt and olive oil.
2507 2018-04-11 19:50:31 I'm an Albertan and my financial portfolio is already far too top heavy in the oil and gas sector for my liking.  
Or health.
2508 2018-04-11 19:50:25 Thanks Megan! We've sounded our #PalmOilAlarmCall and would encourage other retailers to look carefully at the issues and consider how they can reduce demand for palm oil.
2509 2018-04-11 19:50:24 Am highly impressed with the Govts actions to shut down offshore oil and gas exploration. There is copious evidence that proves how destructive these are for the planet. 
At long last NZ is returning to standing up for the planet and all people, not just the wealthy.

2510 2018-04-11 19:50:20 Look at this big lie.... 'we supply oil to Sudan'. So Sudan produce and buy oil.

2511 2018-04-11 19:50:19 That’s funny! Glad to be quasi famous. But seriously, much smarter for AB to invest in a post oil economy. Just the way it’s headed. I’ll post some articles
2512 2018-04-11 19:50:18 Haha, I meant Essential Oil. It came from my oil group.
2513 2018-04-11 19:49:49 Changed my oil now finna go handle my business
2514 2018-04-11 19:49:31 Took my car in only expecting to pay $100 for an oil change & servicing, left a stack broker  Owning a car is a scam 
2515 2018-04-11 19:49:29 I know I didn’t vote for the snake oil salesman...
2516 2018-04-11 19:49:28 Go drink some motor oil!
2517 2018-04-11 19:49:25 I don't see why ending oil exploration is controversial.

We know we can't burn the oil we have already found without causing catastrophic climate change.

What's the point looking for more?
2518 2018-04-11 19:49:22 Any evening that I'm home alone and not either slathered with a hair mask or dripping in body oil or doing a face mask is frankly a waste.
2519 2018-04-11 19:49:19 I watch the hashtag #OkLeg with Tweetdeck & in the past thirty minutes i've seen a ton of pretty new twitter accounts with non-descript stock photos start a big Tax wind not oil and gas push. 

Somebody seems to have hired them some twitter bots...

2522 2018-04-11 19:49:14 @RachelNotley  Hi I am a bc resident you should take an add out in the paper here. Let people know the Americans are shipping thousands of barrels of oil off bc coast in ships .If your government would pledge to clean up a spill and show us the equipment to do so it would help .

2529 2018-04-11 19:48:46 Suadis want rid of Assad do the US, UK, France will do their dirty work in return for Oil & Arm deals.
The US want Syria to establish a military base. Every country the US as invaded since WWII the US have occupied with a military base

2533 2018-04-11 19:48:32 It was in a mess due to OPEC oil price increases as was the rest of the world. Not much peace in Northern Ireland and not much prosperity to the northern rust belt. But as long as you're alright that what matters.

2535 2018-04-11 19:48:25 Hmmmm, common interests huh?  Couldn't have anything to do with OIL could it?  I figure their interests are $$$$$ and "our" interests are YOUR INTERESTS.  Just cannot trust you anymore.

2543 2018-04-11 19:47:45 The joke is that whenever a US President talks Mideast Peace they only mean Israel and Palestinians - the rest of the region is only good for oil
2544 2018-04-11 19:47:30 #PalmOilAlarmCall Congrats to Iceland for ending the use of palm oil in their products! Now it's time for other companies to end this practice and help improve the chances of life for orangutans and local people alike.

2557 2018-04-11 19:46:42 When so much is laid bare for all to see, it is so clear that these wars are about Rothschild  or oil/resources , why are people flag waving & going along with it? Why?
2558 2018-04-11 19:46:41 One point being left out of by the "Alberta cannot shut-down the oil to BC" expert crowd is that the Province of Alberta, no differently then here in BC, pretty much owns ALL of the sub-surface rights...and by extension ultimately where they go. Or in the case of BC, may not go.
2559 2018-04-11 19:46:33 For Oil and Resources!!

Don't delude yourself. No one actually wants anything to do America and their supposed freedom.

Our Interest lies in 7 million Indians working in the Gulf, the remittances we receive from there & their oil. That's it. India does not have luxury to care for these Human Rights type publicity noises.

2566 2018-04-11 19:46:02 Era of oil dominance is coming to an end. Next is natural gas production and securing pipelines to that market.

2574 2018-04-11 19:45:24 I will say that it is no coincidence that every high GDP country has a large government. Zero examples of economically successful countries with small governments. (Oil export countries aside).

2600 2018-04-11 19:43:09 Not true. Droughts create water scarcity. Governments create water shortages. We have the water but regulations prohibit transportation what would be the price of a barrel of oil today if oil was regulated like water #MakeWaterAffordableAgain

2603 2018-04-11 19:42:35 Where do I start -

Well, Rand is falling - again. It saw some unusual strengthening in Dec, when this guy became ANC Pres. But the euphoria is waning. The Rand is weakening again - reality setting in. So, with a weak Rand, & SA a net importer of oil, petrol price is increasing.

2606 2018-04-11 19:42:06 Energy independence? LMFAO we are more dependent on oil now than we’ve ever been. Strong military? By under cutting leaders and handing the country on a silver platter? Bring back manfgr? WHERE?!?!

2623 2018-04-11 19:40:41 Between taking my puppy to the vet, getting my alignment fixed/having my oil changed and getting new tires for my car... I’ve spent over $1,200 today.
2624 2018-04-11 19:40:39 Just  pull yourself up by your bootstraps while we steal your boots, dump oil  on the cliff, set it on fire, and charge you for hanging there in the  first place.

2633 2018-04-11 19:39:53 No, that’s not the big question or the small question. That’s the part of this project that makes no sense for Canada and absolutely no sense to BC. No increase in the amount of oil tankers will be allowed by the people of BC and any other Canadian that cares! #StoppedKM #BCpoli
2634 2018-04-11 19:39:52 Deep State is False Flag / Sucker Punching Trump & America in Syria to keep control of Neo-Feudal, Global Fascist Empire that Trump is killing. Syria punished for “wrong” oil pipeline choice. I hope Trump is posturing with brilliant counter-punch coming???
2635 2018-04-11 19:39:48 Hi Nathan, I understand you're concerned about fuel prices and that it can be frustrating to find that prices sometimes differ between our stores. Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can. 1/2

2643 2018-04-11 19:39:12 I despise Utd and their fans with so much passion but ffs, the oil rich Mancs have out done them this last week, fu**ing hate them now on the same level #LFC #horribleclub #MancBastards
2644 2018-04-11 19:38:59 so yay just spent the past hour working on my bike, getting the motor topped off with fluids and putting a new petcock in the tank with a prefilter on it. and it runs like a charm! whoo.. I think my last issue was not enough oil in the crank case, hard to fill.
2645 2018-04-11 19:38:56 Olive oil for our delicious foods 
2646 2018-04-11 19:38:51 You can also use coconut oil to help sooth it a little and it’s completely safe dogs (and actually really good for them!)

2650 2018-04-11 19:38:42 I left my hair oil at home and I’m very floof right now
2651 2018-04-11 19:38:40 If the United States wanted the oil they would have sent in the ground troops 6 or 7 years ago. I'm sure Russia do though, which is why they're there in strength
2652 2018-04-11 19:38:39 Also, the COSRX pimple patches are a freaking lifesaver for attacking single breakouts. Just leave them overnight and in the morning you can actually see all the oil they’ve absorbed. They’re amazing!
2653 2018-04-11 19:38:38 Why do u drink oil?

2657 2018-04-11 19:38:19 a couple more ideas (minus links lol) - super cute matching slippers (could also be monogrammed), a "well rested" kit (eye mask, lavender oil, sleepy tea, etc..) for the night, along those lines: hangover kit. ive also seen gift certs for a blow out or mani/pedi

2664 2018-04-11 19:37:55 Not to mention the oil...
2665 2018-04-11 19:37:54 Since listening to a radio phone-in about palm oil yesterday I've not been able to stop thinking about Hob Nobs. Do Iceland do own brand biscuits?

2667 2018-04-11 19:37:27 Have the Iraqis made an evaluation of how much (oil, treasuries,..) USA robbed them? They did, but US doesn't care as it puts Cheney where it belongs, in a jail cell.
Sadly in wars the vultures survive, let it be TOLD. Syria is a martyr nation.
2668 2018-04-11 19:37:24 Check out oil prices & amount of Putin's support in elections & polls. US does not have any strategy here, these are just series of sporadic uncoordinated moves, which announced successful by tamed media when their results incidentally correlate with shifts in global world.

2671 2018-04-11 19:37:13 So, they want to send oil THROUGH us, but not TO us. How does that work?
2672 2018-04-11 19:37:11 @sorola @burnie @bdunkelman With sponsors for ED, baldness, skin care and pyramid scheme fitness programs invading your podcasts. I feel uncomfortable listening to your shows. Some of those ads aren’t even legal outside of the US.

I hope you can stop promoting snake oil.
2673 2018-04-11 19:37:07 Hope they are coming out same way to register Common entrance, WAEC and NECO

2689 2018-04-11 19:34:58 If he knew what he was talking about, he would comment that oil production & exploration indexes shot up wildly today (and Mon/Tues)

He'd still be wrong, but at least on the right track to an actual point
2690 2018-04-11 19:34:54 @breebunn did he fall into an oil vat wtf
2691 2018-04-11 19:34:52 Ok so we produce oil in AB and other provinces and our leaders don't want us to sell any of it outside of Canada. So an abundance of oil in Canada should drive the cost of refined products down. #inaperfectworld

2693 2018-04-11 19:34:42 Not really about Syrian oil reserves that r modest but oil/gas pipeline through Syria & more importantly it's about western control of middle east. West support Saudi genocide in Yemen etc but attack anyone that doesn't fall into line Iraq, Libya, Syria. Western imperialism
2694 2018-04-11 19:34:18 Although I can’t stand Nutella I’d say use @JimJams_Spreads instead. It’s far better for you and doesn’t use palm oil etc
2695 2018-04-11 19:34:06 As a family & a people we have been robbed & violated. I'd sue but who? We just want an even playing field & our money back. Bush closed our wells, Obama taxed us out of business & gave our jobs to others. We don't want other people's stuff just our ancestors land oil & gas.
2696 2018-04-11 19:34:05 Like the jobs & tax cuts changed some minds n the Black community. (MORW PLEASE), Money talks,  some are making money off war. We have natural gas & oil here in Texas, let me know if you want some. We have been in a terrible financial rut since 1999, lost pensions and wages.

2704 2018-04-11 19:33:19 Hey-Oyster, VA, is THREE FEET above sea level. They should sue big oil/gas for property damage due to climate change & rising seas. Also-all those blue coastal areas will turn red towns blue as low lying "coastal elites(my ass!)" pick up and move.
2705 2018-04-11 19:33:17 Wise words. Of course Jeremy is principled. 

The ones wanting war are doing it not for humanitarian reasons, but in order to grab natural resources. They don't want a settlement, they want to destroy Syria and Iran as states and grab their oil.
2706 2018-04-11 19:33:13 You know why?

Because (a) all of the existing oil and gas permits have not been cancelled. So the industry in Taranaki will continue on happily. It will be a gradual transition, not a cliff drop.

And (b) the total energy consumption is going to keep rising. And guess what?

2730 2018-04-11 19:31:38 That was the second time they colluded with Saudis to bring down oil prices to damage Russian economy. The first time was during the cold war, with Reagan at helm; thus bringing down the Soviet Empire. Strong Russia s at odds with western interest, so periodically ruin their eco.

2736 2018-04-11 19:30:58 Your company is definitely responsible for polluting part of India with mercury and I am not sure how responsible your purchasing of palm oil is.

2751 2018-04-11 19:29:34 We need a strong economy to make the expensive transition to new energy sources. Ending oil now is like kneecapping ourselves before trying to jump a hurdle.

2757 2018-04-11 19:28:35 Why should govt be in the refinery business at all? Recently, Essar Oil a pvt refiner was sold 100% to Rosneft, the Russian oil giant. 

Govt can use the resources to instead deliver better public services like healthcare, infra, agri support to creat jobs and reduce poverty.

2760 2018-04-11 19:28:04 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
2761 2018-04-11 19:28:02 The decision by this new Government to ban future oil exploration is a move so bold & courageous it genuinely gives me hope - congratulations @nzlabour @NZGreens @YoungNZFirst #nzpol
2762 2018-04-11 19:28:01 If you're an oil company working on a long lead time offshore project you're not evaluating it off of the back of the curve?
2763 2018-04-11 19:27:54 No. US ME policy based on creating weak , oil producing dependencies - to force Europe and Asia into line - and supporting Isreal. Nothing else matters. This why Iran such a bugaboo .

If they had not shamelessly plundered the weath of the Russian people, they could afford a military that could stand and fight.

2817 2018-04-11 19:22:26 The front is not influenced by the back. The back is influenced by the front, as it rolls forward. The back highlights the degree to which the mkt is demanding present produced oil. To read the tail price as the mkts expected price, on that date, is wrong.

Look at what's happened to Iraqi Kurdistan, that's largely what has happened. Rampant cronyism, & it's basically a patronage state based on oil revenues. Even their chickens come from Brazil!
2828 2018-04-11 19:21:17 Which is why this looks like smoke and mirrors huff and bluff, kabuki theater which scares civilians into fear, which is monetized via the oil market.

2888 2018-04-11 19:14:38 Hey U of A ...Ask multi millionaire Suzuki (the Oil Hater) to give the University’s a few Million Dollars. You sure as hell won’t get much from the Oil industry! Odd we always thought University Execs were smart. No, they’re extremely overpaid fools & they just had a Govt pay cut

It looks like an oil painting of lava being flung everywhere and it's kinda pretty but also    N O OOOO
2893 2018-04-11 19:14:20 It really is too bad Albertans didn't rise to the occasion over many, many years, when they had all that money sitting in the bank, to encourage their politicians to direct their investment into fields other than oil, knowing all the while that this resource was doomed.
2894 2018-04-11 19:14:17 since when does the rule of law have any meaning to big oil? And how about all those non-scientific information spread by lobbyist and think tanks?

2898 2018-04-11 19:13:47 So how many spills are occurring in the world right now??  Thousands of tankers are hauling oil around the world right now, Seattle is sending them right were area are going to go. Where are all those protests? I’m sure they will be doing everything in there power that it’s safe

2903 2018-04-11 19:13:21 The price of crude oil under PDP was between $80 to $140 and PDP still borrowed. Now that crude oil is around $50 it is fair enough for APC to borrow

2907 2018-04-11 19:12:46 We’re showing that it is possible for supermarkets to remove palm oil from products! We'd encourage others to look at the issues and consider how they can reduce demand for palm oil
2908 2018-04-11 19:12:37 National Post is heavily funded by Alberta Oil. It is no wonder all of the frequent "speakers" they give outrageous sums to for nauseating diatribes are now making this a life and death issue for one trick pony Alberta.
2909 2018-04-11 19:12:35 Russian MinFin stopped buying FX in Wellbeing fund in last two days.
So with oil at the these levels BoP fundamentals are favorable for RUB again.
But not sure about rates/OFZs-CBR in theory is inflation expectations driven, and FX volatility is v bad for perception of inflation
2910 2018-04-11 19:12:35 I found a peanut butter that uses vegetable oil instead of palm and it doesn't have any of that extra nasty bad for you stuff in it either.
2911 2018-04-11 19:12:32 Or what about Myrna Santiago’s Ecology of Oil or Linda Nash’s Inescapable Ecologies? Or one of @nelangst ‘s books?

2914 2018-04-11 19:12:27 And why would we want to help Russia's economy?

You have already caused oil prices to spike by 26.5%. Haven't you helped Putin enough? Or does he want you to stay until you harm America more?

2920 2018-04-11 19:11:23 If you want to get rid of spots use a gentle nonfoam cleanser n use rose hip seed oil to keep the skin hydrated, other products tend to dry out and irritate sensitive skin
2921 2018-04-11 19:11:20 Well, if you are used to working in layers and adaptability, would then working in layered papers, like a collage, not suit your style? From there one could merge into Acrylics. You can definitely  get the textures with Oil or Acrylic, but Acrylic is a bit cheaper to start in
2922 2018-04-11 19:11:19 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
2923 2018-04-11 19:11:18 I am really exhausted because I cleaned parts from the oil all day long... it was boring and I kept my head down all the time which results in a pain in my neck now
2924 2018-04-11 19:11:17 There’s been no consultation with the Oil & Gas industry either. It’s a terrible decision which will directly impact the industry.

Its not only oil & I don’t think timing is lost on trump either (stormy/fbi) but it’s ultimately geopolitics. Dems r on board 4 good reason too.
2931 2018-04-11 19:10:49 Global demand for oil and gas is growing. NZ should help provide this and gain the economic benefits.
·         Oil and gas are forecast to continue to make up around half the world’s energy needs by 2040.
·         Natural gas demand is expected to grow 45% by 2040 (IEA).
2932 2018-04-11 19:10:40 ...reduces economic growth. A #carbontax HELPS the economy, as opposed to HURTING it like taxes on working and investment do.

A carbon tax can be REBATED 100% in the form of either direct payments (like the  #AlaskaPermanentFund does with oil revenue), or by reducing other taxes

2942 2018-04-11 19:09:57 Seriously @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley even @jjhorgan - WHERE is the effort to support these #communities with #green jobs? Why are the only options for #indigenouscommunities & other ppl in #BC or #AB an #oil #pipeline or nothing?!

There are many other options!
2943 2018-04-11 19:09:56 Oh ok, yeah its a lot of work trting to get baby out  i went 42 weeks with my oldest daughter it was horrible. DO NOT DRINK CASTOR OIL! It will give you the poops and is dangerous for baby because he can poop inside and swallow it which can cause him to become very sick.
2944 2018-04-11 19:09:53 Great attitude. I do actually try to limit my use of all petroleum products. I have lobbied and supported local government to make decisions that lower our dependence on oil and I pay very high carbon taxes (which also encourages less consumption). What do you do?

2956 2018-04-11 19:08:31 I always check any products I buy and avoid any containing palm oil not only to protect rainforests but also because it is not good for you!
2957 2018-04-11 19:08:31 it s a good time for U.S.A. to test  the Russian anti missile weapons. Because when we see the price of crude oil rigged like today, it ' s fair to assume their will be wars coming. History shows that when markets are flagrantly rigged  their is new wars in the world.

2962 2018-04-11 19:07:50 Hi Shelly - we've considered sustainable palm oil & recognise the movement is working in good faith, but we believe its progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to really tackle the problems is to limit palm oil demand
2963 2018-04-11 19:07:49 @SpeakerRyan Why can you give huge subsidies to big oil, and then when you subsidize the working poor, all of a sudden it is entitlement?? And that's what you cut....the help for children, for the working poor, for single moms whose child support never comes.....
2964 2018-04-11 19:07:44 Well, yes, it is all down to Oil for profit. Smash a country to bits and then "offer" to rebuild in return for cheap Oil.
Been done so many times in the past and the population believe the lies. Sheep mentality.??

2974 2018-04-11 19:06:48 The economic contribution from oil and gas in NZ is significant.
• up to 11,720 jobs, including 7,070 in Taranaki.
• average salary of $105,000 - twice the New Zealand average of $50,000.
• 2.5% of GDP
• pays around $500 million per year in royalties and taxes.

3023 2018-04-11 19:01:14 Back before the oil price crash, Harold Hamm predicted that oil could not last below $70 a barrel, because neither Saudi Arabia nor the US shale industry could accept that level for long. Was he wrong?

All the job creation, price increase in oil sands, spin off business, taxes on all that, plus the guarantee of mkt access. Otherwise, AB deferring its success to others.
3037 2018-04-11 19:00:24 In fearness, APC need to borrow cos they didn't enjoy what PDP enjoyed. We know the price of crude oil before 1999, we know how the price soared, we know the price of the crude oil now, PDP did  not reduce to borrow at all, hearing that they borrowed even baffled me.

3055 2018-04-11 18:59:23 Btw imports have increased by 0.75 mbpd from last week's rates. If we see higher imports despite higher domestic production, that might mean refiners are importing more heavy oil to get ready for summer. Btw, we'll see a drop sometime this month at refinery utilization

3146 2018-04-11 18:50:15 Oil Tomi, oil is why we have an interest in Syria. The pipelines through Syria is of strategic importance for our partners in BP and Shell. We HAVE to take it or else the Russians will one up over us
3147 2018-04-11 18:50:12 How will this change oil equation,
 i dont understand... Crude at 70 dollars remains a threat always to India 
1 in form of subsidy (pain to Exchequer n fiscal deficit)

2 in form of dollar strengthing

Plz explain... A new paper article link will also work 
If available with u
3148 2018-04-11 18:49:23 So beautiful!  Doesn't even look real.  Looks like an imagined oil painting,
3149 2018-04-11 18:49:21 Weaken Assad by causing a civil war then go in after we think we can win. All because of the Yankee Oil Dollar.
3150 2018-04-11 18:49:20 8% is 92% too little IMO. Scotland’s Oil. Scotland’s money

3152 2018-04-11 18:49:15 He was seen by a policeman in Glasgow they said hello then Willie said "I've got them now" patting his briefcase. I think it was it was the oil lie.
3153 2018-04-11 18:49:10 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。

3159 2018-04-11 18:48:29 stock prices for oil watch them closely
3160 2018-04-11 18:48:29 Only one bottle of coconut oil allowed!
3161 2018-04-11 18:48:27 Roast them with olive oil, salt, pepper and cayenne like usual- and after you take them out while still warm add feta. The flavors are amazing
3162 2018-04-11 18:48:24 I put new potatoes and oil in the oven and they came out like chip shop chips. It’s the best day of my life.

3168 2018-04-11 18:47:49 Apologies, Jim, just read in The Street that you mentioned Oil last night. Don't always catch up with MM 'til the weekend.
3169 2018-04-11 18:47:49 Kill their own people? Wow! That is an amazing stretch to compare oil to fentanyl... even by your standards.

3173 2018-04-11 18:47:43 BUT, since we're on the topic of Syria, you're ignorant of the facts that
1. It's not actually a civil war
2. The 'moderate' rebels are terrorists
3. Bashar is fighting those terrorists
4. The US and Saudi Arabia created and aid those terrorists
5. Oil

3176 2018-04-11 18:47:19 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
3177 2018-04-11 18:47:12 Name one replacement for oil.
3178 2018-04-11 18:46:53 I'm sorry to hear about your health challenge @kurteichenwald, would not wish that on anyone.  My friend's daughter found great relief from CBD oil, in case you're still searching for comfort.  You do great work and we are lucky to have your example as encouragement.
3179 2018-04-11 18:46:50 There is a painting on auction on ebay right now. It's for the original oil painting for the new #Dominaria card Lyra Dawnbringer. It's nearly 7k bid so far. I want it so bad but I could never ever afford a painting that costly.

3183 2018-04-11 18:46:24 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
3184 2018-04-11 18:46:16 Just need an oil change...Just need to hurry up with my shit because I’m hungry like a mf lol
3185 2018-04-11 18:46:14 Oil, baby, oil.
3186 2018-04-11 18:45:59 We can all agree Harper was very bad for this country. We need these lines to proceeed for our economy though and to remain competitive and create jobs. Its more dangerous transfering this oil by truck and harder on the environment.
3187 2018-04-11 18:45:53 Crude oil ! Is buyers product. Every extractor seller wants to secure his produce as almost every country has it and many have this as the only revenue source, erecting refinery is forward integration that end-user will use it's products.
3188 2018-04-11 18:45:44 just wasted my peppermint oil all on my pants 
3189 2018-04-11 18:45:43 The basic Canadian attitude is that the oil belongs to Canada not AB. 2ndly interprovincial movement of it is not up to AB. 3rd if it stays in the ground we dont care. .
3190 2018-04-11 18:45:42 We on the oil spill sooooo
3191 2018-04-11 18:45:17 my dad handed my mom an amazon box and said your cooking oil or something is here... 
mom pulled out the bottles and showed me, they were tanning lotions. 
she said, yo fat ass always worried bout some food & that’s the problem
3192 2018-04-11 18:45:16 It could be a minerial oil bath/tank and those fish aren't real... 
3193 2018-04-11 18:45:04 Lol you think it's by perfume oil
3194 2018-04-11 18:45:04 The woman watching YouTube videos at the top volume of her phone next to me at the oil change place is very annoying. She’s interrupting me watching @JudgeJudy. Get a life sweetheart.
3195 2018-04-11 18:44:53 NZ got minimal royalties since The Muldoon Govt pre-sold the oil exploration rights to multinationals in the 1970s. #WorldBank  Just some PAYE from NZ workers. Not worth the effort, Like water bottlers, foreign entities are getting our resources for free.
3196 2018-04-11 18:44:51 I can see #Crudelight oil going to 68 but I wouldn’t be long there.
3197 2018-04-11 18:44:48 New Zealand will ban any future offshore oil and gas exploration - by not granting any future exploration permits outside Taranaki. @SkyNewsAust @SkyBusiness
3198 2018-04-11 18:44:47 I wonder why with all the oil flowing through BC, that Vancouver has the most expensive gas in North America? Because shipping out raw oil is more profitable for companies but screws canadians but this topic is to complicated for you to understand.
3199 2018-04-11 18:44:41 Should apply to Alaska oil payments then.
3200 2018-04-11 18:44:34 @StellaSata Thanku for ur gud job.l have a vibrant business plan on palm oil processing. Pls ma ,i need help.@ezim_peter
3201 2018-04-11 18:44:29 The friendly old man not only pumped their gas, he washed their  windshield. "Would you kids, like a cool soda pop?" The two nodded and  he brought them both grape sodas. Then he asked if he could check the oil.
3202 2018-04-11 18:44:29 So you choose to be photographed next to MRI machine as they cost the same as one Tomahawk misile, how many will she drop on Syria. 
Remember US PIpeline also Russian pipeline runs through there, 
not that it’s about OIL or anything 
3203 2018-04-11 18:44:29 the oil argument while relevant does not excuse the use violence
3204 2018-04-11 18:44:17 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
3205 2018-04-11 18:44:05 Let's see if I've got this right...the people in BC tell you we don't want your filthy stinking oil & so your response is to 'punish' us by withholding what we don't want in the first place? #Mathishard #bcpoli #cdnpoli #undrip
3206 2018-04-11 18:44:00 ...effect of crashing of crude oil prices. But now that it has recovered, Saudis should pay.
3207 2018-04-11 18:43:58 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
3208 2018-04-11 18:43:52 He’s the opposition leader genius. That’s what a leader is supposed to do. Harper didn’t get things done. The Oil boom got things done. Oil isn’t as profitable now. Companies are cancelling projects all over the world.
3209 2018-04-11 18:43:52 For oil,,,,

3212 2018-04-11 18:43:37 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
3213 2018-04-11 18:43:36 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3214 2018-04-11 18:43:35 I went to do an oil change on my car today and the guy was telling me so much stuff I had to do and I had no idea wtf he was saying so I called my stepdad LMFAO
3215 2018-04-11 18:43:31 And conditions in Libya can be argued to be even worse. Slavery, Jihadis, massive oil theft and breakdown of law. 

It’s not a binary choice. It’s a outrage that the UN are as inept as ever, I’d at least want to see a peacekeeping mission try to stabilise things

3220 2018-04-11 18:42:54 Thanks for your reply. How come other companies don’t need palm oil to prevent separation? And in case of separation; surely a good old stir is better than any palm oil, even if sustainable?
3221 2018-04-11 18:42:42 @kevintaftab Just curious--what would the impact of $40, $30, or $25 oil have on the Alberta economy?  Looks like the government is projecting $60 oil by 2023 to balance its budget deficit.
3222 2018-04-11 18:42:42 Could definitely see an additional boost in bank EPS from further reduction in Oil & Gas loan book provisions.. $JPM still sitting on 4bn reserve (criticized) at end of 2017..down almost 50% from 2016 ..

3225 2018-04-11 18:42:30 Hi, actually, that wasn’t his question. His question to which I gave that reply was whether I knew of any funding from commercial interests, eg. a U.S. oil company - to which I replied, no.
3226 2018-04-11 18:42:30 You change your oil every 3,000 miles (roughly, sometimes the oil can go longer) or every 4-6 months. Tires, you just get whats on there now. I can look at church for you if you'd like
3227 2018-04-11 18:42:08 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

3249 2018-04-11 18:39:44 It's not the government that is out of control but the bankers, military contractors and oil corporations who run the country. I would guess that Trump has them covered also, crooks on Wall Street.
3250 2018-04-11 18:39:42 They need some castor oil lol
3251 2018-04-11 18:39:38 No. You are right, maybe I don’t need to panic. I do rec lavender to relax if needed or chamomile tea for older kids if needed. Tea tree oil has studies showing effectiveness for some things like acne, anecdotally for my patients’ molluscum... 1/
3252 2018-04-11 18:39:32 Great to hear that the government has decided not to go ahead with new block offers for oil & gas exploration. While this doesn’t affect current licenses it does draw a line in the sand & limit future environmental damage. Kudos to the team!

3256 2018-04-11 18:39:01 of course it is, let build another pipeline so they can move oil cheaper but still charge the same for gas
3257 2018-04-11 18:39:00 So Arden is banning offshore oil exploration.  However she should now refuse to travel by plane, only by electric car, otherwise she is a hypocrite.
3258 2018-04-11 18:38:58 Have you checked world oil prices lately? On the rise... Canada is only penalized with lower rates due to inability to access world markets! Facts matter!
3259 2018-04-11 18:38:47 @jacindaardern “... About 4500 people are employed directly in the oil and gas exploration industry, the bulk of which are based in Taranaki, around 11000

3264 2018-04-11 18:38:29 It’s a pity it’s such a lousy deal for BC or the more level headed might hold sway. I don’t understand why PM doesn’t insist on bitumen being refined in Alberta. There’s a lot less resistance to light oil being shipped. Even @ElizabethMay might be on side
3265 2018-04-11 18:38:26 I left my history textbook in my car so long, a skinny chocolate bar got into it and melted on a page  I can take the chocolate off since it’s hardened again but 40 pages have a huge oil spot. WOO

3271 2018-04-11 18:37:39 Well done Iceland!!! This is a very serious concern.....especially as palm oil is easily replaced by other more ecologically sound alternatives.
3272 2018-04-11 18:37:21 Here at Eric's Car Care, we want for you to have as little trouble as possible with your car. Remember:
Many motorists believe their cars' oil should be changed every 3,000 miles, however most late-model vehicles now can go 5,000 to 7,000 miles between oil changes.

3285 2018-04-11 18:36:05 Stop this cruelty. US and UK has nothing to look for in Middle East besides oil, gas and money. Same lies about Iraq, Libya, ....
3286 2018-04-11 18:36:01 Peter what is new in oil country?
3287 2018-04-11 18:35:59 Russia has China & Germany on its side to help in economic matters. Germany buys huge volume of piped natural gas from Russia & China buys oil as well as piped natural gas  from Russia.
3288 2018-04-11 18:35:50 Went to get my oil change at Firestone and they covered half the cost for delaying my car 10 minutes. Kinda neat. 
3289 2018-04-11 18:35:39 Motorists may need to prepare to pay more at the pump at the beginning of next month. Analysts say that the latest rise in the price of Brent crude oil, and the slight depreciation of the rand could spur a petrol price increase.
3290 2018-04-11 18:35:35 No. Canadians save billions getting their gas at a discount. Private US oil companies operating in Canada have lower profit margins you mean to say
3291 2018-04-11 18:35:32 Stop it because of God ,due to Mohs influence, and you both get reward,what a beautiful religion is Islam
3292 2018-04-11 18:35:28 Increase in the price of crude oil reflects developments in the Middle East. The increased tension over Syria and reports that Saudi Arabia had intercepted missiles over the capital, Riyadh, have pushed international oil prices.
3293 2018-04-11 18:35:19 Mr.Rajinikanth you please stop comments like supporting police you must think how many innocents are being  in hospital by the police harassment, you 1st support for all social cause in Tamil nadurather than pouring oil in fire.
3294 2018-04-11 18:35:13 That's essentially what this was for Cambridge Analytica until relatively recently. Their ludicrous snake oil was given a dark mystique.
3295 2018-04-11 18:35:11 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
3296 2018-04-11 18:35:09 It'd be much simpler if we're only about oil. It's far more nepharious.
3297 2018-04-11 18:35:09 while stifling opposing views. Syria itself is a small, strategic pawn in a much bigger game. Ever since the 1970s, the Caspian Sea oil fields have  been the big prize in the region, but it requires taking on Russia and Iran. We are being conned. Again.
3298 2018-04-11 18:35:03 Can’t lie, Oil company life sweet!
3299 2018-04-11 18:35:03 Military action in Syria = uncertainty. Uncertainty = spike in oil and other commodities prices. Increased prices = raised risk levels for business. Risk rise + BREXIT = ?
3300 2018-04-11 18:34:55 It won't let me dm you, but i know an essiential oil that works great

3309 2018-04-11 18:34:17 Stocks can be stored as digits on computers infinitely.

Crude oil cannot. Crude oil storage is finite. And when that oil is dumped, price will collapse to as low as $5

3319 2018-04-11 18:33:09 This week’s domestic crude oil production estimate incorporates a re-benchmarking that raised estimated volumes by 100,000 barrels per day, which is just less than 1.0% of this week’s estimated production total.

3330 2018-04-11 18:32:19 Sickening that the crude oil that makes plastic sat in the earth for millions of years didnt hurt a single animal in all that time but as soon as humans fuck with it it becomes 1000x more destructive

3332 2018-04-11 18:32:16 Also, kinder pipeline is about shipping oil out to world markets and isn’t intended for Canadians so it will actually drive the price of gasoline up

3338 2018-04-11 18:31:57 I am so glad you said that. My husband and I worked until we were 70. I taught school and he worked for an oil company. Our three kids all worked hard, finished college and have awesome jobs! Our grandchildren are also following in our footsteps. We are thankful and blessed.
3339 2018-04-11 18:31:45 People in the white house that know what Trump will be tweeting  will make good money on the stock markets but all others will lose big,  no more fundamentals applies . Crude oil stockpiles increasing and crude oil going through the roof so that inflation goes up thrust the roof
3340 2018-04-11 18:31:38 So basically I was making my own tortilla chips by frying cut up tortillas in a pan with oil. I started an oil fire. Instead of putting it out like a normal human  I threw it on the floor. The fire went out, but there was a hole in the carpet. I also burned my hair off.
3341 2018-04-11 18:31:37 i’ve reached the point in the semester where i have one billion responsibilities but all i have the energy to do is lay in bed and watch time lapses of oil paintings on youtube
3342 2018-04-11 18:31:37 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
3343 2018-04-11 18:31:21 Dear @SUBWAY how is the guy making my salad going to get an attitude with me when I ask for oil and vinegar? He put oil on the salad, told me he was out of vinegar then got pissed. Wtf?
3344 2018-04-11 18:31:15 Really need to go get a oil change 
3345 2018-04-11 18:31:09 I always thought it was oil personally.

3352 2018-04-11 18:30:23 You can avoid / sidestep the facts. But it doesn't change them. Oil demand in 2018 will be 100,000 barrels, PER DAY, higher than 2017. Reality is we use oil. The question is do we want to support #trumpoil #bloodoil or good old job supporting / healthcare paying #ohCanada oil?
3353 2018-04-11 18:30:21 Or it kicks off war with Russia.
Hello, WWWIII.

3358 2018-04-11 18:29:56 The world is complicated. For instance, EU needs oil. They not only buy oil from Russia, but also try to sabotage Russia. The Syria war came from Assad refused the oil pipes to go through Syria to send oil from middle East countries to EU. The witch hunt is nasty & complicated.
3359 2018-04-11 18:29:52 If you mean Venezuela don’t forget their GDP was 90% oil. Bit of market manipulation and the whole thing goes tits up. Wonder if USA had a hand in that, hardly Chavez’s biggest fans.

3413 2018-04-11 18:23:18 India produces fairly small amount of crude oil..and that is not expected to grow significantly. I think bulk of the input crude into this refinery will come from outside (middle east).
3414 2018-04-11 18:23:10 Again..... They will just ship it by train like they do right now instead. The pipeline is cheaper and safer than trains. Safer. Win for BC. Cheaper. Win for the oil companies

3416 2018-04-11 18:23:04 When was Britain appointed the world police? Considering that trope, isn't that the UN's job?
Apart from the litany of dead people killed in the crossfires of our involvement in oil wars who died and made Britain boss?

3422 2018-04-11 18:21:50 So a policy of renationalising railways, etc differs from setting up a national oil company using government money, differs how.

Seems to me that one is much more profitable than the other.
3423 2018-04-11 18:21:49 once i had a guy come into work complaining that we use canola oil in our baked goods bc apparently its “really bad” but the dipshit didnt even know about how much worse palm oil is like ???? if ur gonna try and be an eco warrior at least get all the info lmao
3424 2018-04-11 18:21:49 I know... but the train or the pipeline will bring it to the inlet then tankers will ship it.... The tankers are always in the picture. The big choice is do we want to ship the oil by train or pipeline to the tankers.
3425 2018-04-11 18:21:38 Explain to me what you do with the oil if BC blocks all goods coming from Alberta through BC?
Right nothing, BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DROP OF OIL HAS TO PASS THROUGH BC.
I know people like you are not good with geography but look it up, you got nowhere to go.
3426 2018-04-11 18:21:37 Geopolitical instability has not left the global oil market.
3427 2018-04-11 18:21:27 @Vic_Gill just read your piece on the atlantic ocean warming system. Loved it. Rather unnerving. One of those things that could hit a tipping point (like peak oil) and then accelerate wildly. Haven't seen the film day after tomorrow, but I'll have a look now 
3428 2018-04-11 18:21:26 i want taco bell but the jeep is acting up and i need to take it for an oil change but........... im lazy
3429 2018-04-11 18:21:25 Just paid $50 for an oil change and an air filter, have a $50 credit card payment, and $182 medical bill to pay this week. And I need gas. SUGAR DADDY WYA

3437 2018-04-11 18:20:06 @CNRailway has a certain budget for cars. They stocked up on oil cars and not grain cars but, they don’t favour oil over grain.

3440 2018-04-11 18:19:53 The oil and gas industry has come a long ways since the 80s.Things are not done that way they were then.
Technology has changed, attitude towards environment has changed. And all for the better. Like any industry it's always striving to do better. And the vast improvements show.
3441 2018-04-11 18:19:51 Yes and after Syria is Iran then Somalia or vice versa. Then SOUTH Pakistan. Don't forget YEMEN. Been on the cards for yrs. Said all this before GE15 if you check my TL! Once again for oil and shale. Kids dying for profit. One FUBAR system of global govt. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
3442 2018-04-11 18:19:50 I think we are more than oil and gas. It is a big part of our economy, but I don’t think he’s saying Fuck off Alberta.
3443 2018-04-11 18:19:49 The United States is currently having conflict with  Saudi Arabia and Syria which is where we get our oil. Recent events may have played a key role in price spike.
3444 2018-04-11 18:19:33 Makes competitors happy.
3445 2018-04-11 18:19:33 24 hours after Saudi Arabia expressed preference for oil prices above $70, houthi rebels fire missiles into Riyadh driving oil prices up. I didn’t say anything o!
3446 2018-04-11 18:19:27 I’m hate seeing my oil low for my car
3447 2018-04-11 18:19:25 At the end of the day it’s all just about the OIL and the MONEY

3451 2018-04-11 18:19:02 Maybe oil company access to banking but not oil sales I think. .
3452 2018-04-11 18:19:02 Are we to cripple our oil and gas sector due to catastrophic climate fears, only to have our market share gobbled up by the Americans? No reduction in GHG, just an economically diminished presence in the sector.
3453 2018-04-11 18:19:01 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
3454 2018-04-11 18:18:59 The future is made by what we do now, not by the self-serving predictions of the oil company executives.
3455 2018-04-11 18:18:59 Many Turkish inventions were given away credit to Arabs because of oil.

3458 2018-04-11 18:18:51 Oooh girl same  bout to take my car for an oil change too and they gonna be talking shit. It’s just the outside tho
3459 2018-04-11 18:18:48 That's a priority. Necessary for our survival. I'm sure sooner or later, we are going to realize that water is more important than the atom bomb.

The water that we have in our reservoirs is like oil. A hydro guy would understand what I just said.
3460 2018-04-11 18:18:44 I fail to understand how they cannot see how the GOP is dead set on putting us all back into the 19th Century. Living in Company housing, with Grandma and disabled relatives piled in with us. And the Oil and Coal Barons running the country. It's happening NOW.
3461 2018-04-11 18:18:42 We need to become energy independent. Put California on other side of border wall. Let the good people of California seek live else where. Drilling for oil is only way to bring cost in line. I don't go there to much corruption period.

3463 2018-04-11 18:18:37 @CTVpolitics @seunokin Those who sponsored the senseless attacks on our oil sector in the early days of this government should be blamed for making Nigeria and Nigerians poorer. #PoliticsToday
3464 2018-04-11 18:18:37 "Hi, this is the president of the United States, we're the the only world superpower, isnt that exciting, now while you have the privelage of talking to someone so awesomely powerful, did I hear you say you have oil? Nono its useless stuff, we just want to, um, borrow some okay?"
3465 2018-04-11 18:18:36 It is indeed the reality! The recent announcement by KM only reaffirms what we’ve know from the start, that our coast will not be risked for the benefit of KM shareholders to sell oil to Asia. #StoopedKM

3469 2018-04-11 18:18:12 Today - Crude oil is up $1.35-a-barrel to a 31/2-year high of US$66.77. Oil stocks are still trading just above multi-year lows. Accumulation is warranted.
3470 2018-04-11 18:18:12 i went to get an oil change this morning and when i was about to leave the dude asked me if i was gonna drive back to school LMAO
3471 2018-04-11 18:18:01 2) It doesn't matter who it's coming from, Canada or internationally, it needs to stop. Our governments (North American & friends) create wars to get more fossil fuels, not much better than the other countries we get oil from
3472 2018-04-11 18:17:52 I guess I assumed oil was part of it.  Interesting
3473 2018-04-11 18:17:45 Smarmy oil
3474 2018-04-11 18:17:41 I think it is incredible how much flavor you can import to a dish with some combination of butter, olive oil, salt, and pepper. I think about this a lot as a designer. Foundational ingredients.

3478 2018-04-11 18:17:24 @Bob_Stauffer talks glowingly about him often and hints that he won’t be in the WHL for long. Many teams watching him. Hope Oil are one of them. His players speak very highly of him too.

3480 2018-04-11 18:17:12 Hey man, I’m glad to hear that you’re able to find some relief. I’m wishing you the best. I am not a fan of his protocol or his marketing techniques, but have tried the RS CBD oil and it seems like a very potent product. Self experimentation has been my best tool. 
3481 2018-04-11 18:17:11 You're right. BP still pumping FREE oil from Iraq in war reparation payments. US does the same. These warmongers destroy a country then 'rebuild' it. Taking oil/gas in exchange for 'helping' them get rid of their 'tyrant' rulers. Centuries old modus operandi. GB are the experts.
3482 2018-04-11 18:17:04 The parable of the 10 virgins ties in with the talents parable. Those with oil, gain more talents, gathering both good & bad to furnish the wedding with guests. They preach the gospel unto all nations for 3 days, then the end comes when Jesus returns & the harvest takes place
3483 2018-04-11 18:16:54 Agreed: Risk - balance. Pretty good at these levels for #PANR Bought #88e in their darkest hour between 0.9-1p when all said would fall to 0.5p. Farmout and oil price mitigate risk here
3484 2018-04-11 18:16:52 I can't believe this, I thought you would be different but it appears that you are no better than the useless past PC parties, they couldn't see beyond the Oil industry and it appears you are afflicted with the same tunnel vision. Must be an AB thing.
3485 2018-04-11 18:16:51 FLASH:
Crude Oil Price above $70pb.. 
Foreign Reserves almost $50b..
3486 2018-04-11 18:16:43 OIL Target + 72 % from 7.43 to 12.75
3487 2018-04-11 18:16:27 Even better “Your cheque is in the Mail”. No cash, no gas no oil and border inspections of all trucks from B.C.  They’re either in the country or not, but it is a Canadian coastline, not a B.C. coastline.
3488 2018-04-11 18:16:18 Trains don’t go to Asia. I’m not sure how I can make this any clearer for you, but this is about shipping oil by oil tanker once it reaches the end of the pipeline. #StoppedKM
3489 2018-04-11 18:16:14 Follow the money and you’ll find its corporate welfare for Big Oil in Texas.
3490 2018-04-11 18:16:12 Boys and girls can you remember that time when big tony said theres weapons of mass distruction in iraq so we need to go bomb the fuck out of them only to find loads of oil ? Dont believe what the media tells ya . #trump syria
3491 2018-04-11 18:16:08 HOLY SPIRIT IS THE ANOINTING

3492 2018-04-11 18:16:06 Can someone show me one article from the msm @CNN that connects oil pipelines with our coming world war?
3493 2018-04-11 18:16:04 The temptation to “flash oil” that transom’s nearly overwhelming.  Now I’ve told you of course there’d be no fun in it!
3494 2018-04-11 18:16:03 Yes Alberta & B.C are destroying their land, how do you get oil from the ground? There aren't natural holes in the ground we pump oil out of. My Dad used to work on an oil rig in Alberta in the late 80's.

Why on earth do you think I want archaic & barbaric fossil fuels used?
3495 2018-04-11 18:16:02 I ran out of my lavender essential oil i’m sad
3496 2018-04-11 18:15:57 (I actually don't recommend any of the Lush cleansers for this. I've found they leave a thin coat of oil behind and my skin is not here for that shit. But if you have one you like,hey why not try it)

3497 2018-04-11 18:15:50 I used to think the US was the best country to be born in..... actually Kuwait is the best. Every natural born Kuwaiti citizen receives $50,000 annually from the govt. From oil $! 100% of it goes back to the citizens. If the US govt controlled that we wouldn't see a penny.

3501 2018-04-11 18:15:29 Hi Jason. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
3502 2018-04-11 18:15:23 That might help to explain their death grip to any GPT changes. It only matters if oil men feel broke, they expect others to feel that way naturally.
3503 2018-04-11 18:15:16 Why do people post obvious thirst trapping pictures on social media and then complain about people being in their DMs and comments? Son, you’re half naked, covered in baby oil and winking!

3507 2018-04-11 18:15:11 Hi Amanda. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks

3509 2018-04-11 18:15:00 If we had an actual POTUS, all of Russias oil infrastructure would suddenly shut down, then their power grid, and telecommunications, water is probably going too far... but the current response to Russian aggression is unacceptable. @realDonaldTrump is a failed president.

3515 2018-04-11 18:14:23 just tried oil. yikes.
3516 2018-04-11 18:14:22 I think anyone who votes against taking care of the environment should have their home trashed. We should be allowed to go into their house and throw garbage all over the place, put poison in their water system and their food, spill oil all over and poop all over their lawn.
3517 2018-04-11 18:14:15 Still pouring the Old Engine Oil! Come get some while it lasts!
3518 2018-04-11 18:14:14 This war has been going on for years why didn't you care then? Are you bothered by the atrocities being carried out on Palestinians? I think, once again, this is about oil or gas pipes isn't it? Also please try and have some decorum by not spouting your nonsense in a vile comic.
3519 2018-04-11 18:14:11 Have you tried the hot water bags with flannel and Castor Oil?
3520 2018-04-11 18:14:06 And the US sent troops to North Africa to secure the oil fields before joining a western front which Russians believe to this day cost them 10 million lives!

3525 2018-04-11 18:13:31 Investing in alternative enenergy makes us less dependant on oil and gas from backward countries and their dictators
3526 2018-04-11 18:13:12 So there is a floor to the damage sanctions can do to their economy assuming oil prices do not collapse.

How will the SGR affect movement of oil from the port?Will there really be need for KPC if the SGR offers reliable movement of oil and other related items?

- oil your hair like every other day, ex: tea tree oil , black castor oil - take vitamins for extra growth ( I recommend nature's bounty ) - put on a scarf or bonnet on @ night , because braids cant get really frizzy
3534 2018-04-11 18:12:43 Bought my wife an Acadia, had free oil changes first 2 years, somehow the loaner car I got dropping it off was always a 4x4 Sierra 2500. Clever bastards!

Here drive this 70k truck you really want while we fix your wifes grocery getter, oh yeah they're on "sale."

3537 2018-04-11 18:12:35 CN Rails is quoted as saying they had as much as 45% surge in demand to ship crude by rail in the third quarter. Meanwhile the grain backlog is said to be the the worst since 2013. I believe this may be part of @KylloGreg point about moving oil through increased pipe capacity.
3538 2018-04-11 18:12:31 It's not about Syria, it's all about Oil. Trump&Putin are evil peaces of shit to claim what is not theirs, including many lives of innocent civilians.
3539 2018-04-11 18:12:11 Agreed. I use some natural things as well like bromelain, tumeric and fish oil. But I also get vaccinated and take RX drugs when I need them. At the end of the day, many "drugs" are sourced from "natural" things as well, so it becomes a convoluted argument.
3540 2018-04-11 18:12:09 You mention the Missile Strike  so your buddy Putin can make some money on oil prices going up your a Russian stooge why would anyone with a half a brain telegraph that because it raised oil prices
3541 2018-04-11 18:12:08 Jimmy, Where do you see oil in Q4 2018? $80.00 a barrel?
3542 2018-04-11 18:12:02 I came to this honda agency monday for an oil change but they said itd take 2-4 hours and id be better off making an appointment. I am at my appointment, it is wednesday, and it has been nearly 2 and half hours now
3543 2018-04-11 18:11:56 @CTVpolitics @seunokin FG should be bold to deregulate the price of fuel to solve this problem since oil is an international product. #PoliticsToday
3544 2018-04-11 18:11:53 No arguments there
But the ties with big oil are far more insidious than most

3545 2018-04-11 18:11:51 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease; give this sacred ground permanent protection!
3546 2018-04-11 18:11:47 That's not an argument for EV subsidies. It's an argument against oil subsidies.
3547 2018-04-11 18:11:47 So you think that number is, say, $25,000/car? And EVs don't have all kinds of plastics & smelted materials created from fossil fuels and various minerals mined in third-world death pits? And oh, by the way, we now EXPORT oil & still maintain a Middle East presence for stability.
3548 2018-04-11 18:11:45 MJ oil is the most essential oil.

3551 2018-04-11 18:11:25 Cuts oil supplies in markets to keep the price up for better profits. Specially for UK’s North Sea drilling which has a high cost (lower profit margin).
Iran Deal limited Iran’s ability to sell. Venezuela got socialists to keep their output down.

3558 2018-04-11 18:10:52 I agree with you 100%.  Nobody should be in jail due to marijuana.  That said, I will take some progress as opposed to no progress in this battle.  It's most likely too late to help my dad but not for others.  Cannabis Oil cures Glioblastoma.

3574 2018-04-11 18:09:23 Indeed, my own back of the envelope was more than 20% and I was being conservative the whole way. "Oil-to-chemicals" scale is going to be a big deal.

3576 2018-04-11 18:09:05 Totally support a ‘No’ on palm oil but I’m not clear on your challenge. Just tweet #palmoilalarmcall (done) or are you pushing suppliers to use less palm oil/alternatives to it...what? You are leading the way so please be clear.
3577 2018-04-11 18:09:00 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

3593 2018-04-11 18:07:31 I said this before the pipeline debate should go to the SCC and it will. Until then increase oil by rail traffic at all BC ports to ship bitumen to Asia.

3597 2018-04-11 18:07:21 OPEC is making a last stand effort to raise the price of oil because new supplies of oil are on the horizon! They want to grab as much profit as they can before the supply is flooded.

3600 2018-04-11 18:07:09 Aramco has long wanted to invest in Iranian refining. Almost invested in a refinery that Rosneft ended up investing in because the refinery used to use Iranian oil & Saudi would want it to use its oil.
3601 2018-04-11 18:07:03 Exactly! Also, he could have made the same amount or more by joining the board of a pharmaceutical company, a hedge fund management group, or another oil company, so it's interesting that he chose this path.
3602 2018-04-11 18:06:54 Give yourselves a huge pat on the back for this brave and innovative step! I’ll definitely try your produce knowing it’s palm oil free- don’t need it, don’t want it.

3613 2018-04-11 18:06:04 Eagle Ford is a higher cost shale basin and production didn't recover as quickly. Doesn't surprise me EF is still off its peak. But if oil's at $70 and headed for $80, no surprise it's heating up.

3619 2018-04-11 18:05:10 No inquiry needed, oil was transported by rail rather than in the safest way, a pipeline. Build a pipeline and this will never happen again, there I just saved millions of $$$$.

3657 2018-04-11 18:01:48 Oil is a real cause for environmental concern. Clean up operations can be time consuming and costly. This could have been prevented with adequate procedures in place.  Unfortunately there are still many companies and governments who seek profit before environment.
3658 2018-04-11 18:01:45 Jordan, where is your classical liberalism when it comes to federal subsidies to oil  companies? Can't they pull themselves up by their own bootstraps? Aren't they capable of prudent corporate self management in the adult marketplace?
 Why the ongoing boost from Ottawa?

3661 2018-04-11 18:01:23 @Adam_Stirling you guest is so wrong, No need to built more refineries, Canada has enough refinery capacity plus Alberta has same right to export oil as BC does coal- following his logic BC should build, coal power plants & not export raw coal
3662 2018-04-11 18:01:07 Iran a bundle of confusion. Its annual military budget seems $15 million but its investment on Syria a year ranges from $6 - $35 billion in economic and military assistance that includes 60,000 barrels of oil subsidies a day. Is it religious fascination towards Shiite or Shia?
3663 2018-04-11 18:01:01 Nice! Let’s kill the oceans while we’re at it. More oil! 
3664 2018-04-11 18:00:51 Putin is a thug. He’s been skimming money off russian oil industry and business like a mob boss. He controls with disinformation and torture and murder. He lies and suppresses anyone that stands up to him. What do you think he’s doing to trump? Trump can’t walk away.
3665 2018-04-11 18:00:50 ..out for American allies. The threat of war in Syria makes oil importers all over the world turn to Aramco instead of its competition, enriching MbS and his cronies. While I may not have journalistic evidence for this, the behaviour of the markets makes some of this clear to me.

3680 2018-04-11 17:59:57 Michigan governor: Vessel damaged underwater oil pipelines -
3681 2018-04-11 17:59:53 It Shouldn't Take 3 Hrs For A Damn Oil Change
3682 2018-04-11 17:59:49 That part that gets me is when they be like “ cmon over here let me show u” Nigga i don’t careeeee lmfao Just print out everything that’s wrong so i can leave it in my car until the next oil change lmao
3683 2018-04-11 17:59:44 Hi love, all of our skin care products can also me used by men! We also have an after shave and beard oil 
3684 2018-04-11 17:59:40 ..but note Aramco's strategic plans for expansion within the OPEC countries. Since Trump's tweet, crude prices have spiked across the globe and have driven stock prices higher. The Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline threatened to thwart Saudi oil interests and the POTUS is merely looking..
3685 2018-04-11 17:59:33 After your tweet i had the nerve to ask my boyfriend for his services. He is coming over tonight. And brings oil :)
3686 2018-04-11 17:59:24 My point is that oil is no longer a pain trade.
I DM'ed with him a lot during the E&P bankruptcy apocalypse.
3687 2018-04-11 17:59:14 But the oil lasts way longer.  Instead of every 5,000 or 8,000 miles its like every 15,000
3688 2018-04-11 17:58:55 Cbd oil. It's super easy to order online.
3689 2018-04-11 17:58:43 It’s a hybrid so I need synthetic oil
3690 2018-04-11 17:58:33 CBD oil... any one got any general information on it? or specific info lol doesn't have to be general :P
3691 2018-04-11 17:58:31 So, I think they discovered oil in Syria....
3692 2018-04-11 17:58:24 This is his dckhead face. Daydreaming of gas omissions and oil spills.
3693 2018-04-11 17:58:20 So I learnt something from Tobi today. Rub coconut oil on your armpit and guys can actually fuck it like a pussy. Oh jeeeez I'm just 15 please. #BBNaija
3694 2018-04-11 17:58:11 1. Well *undiluted* bitumen Which is asphalt...... good luck putting that to a pipe. But that's not what they are shipping... They are shipping heavy oil aka diluted bitumen. 2. Yep, no train engine pulling the train... 3. Production changes with or without the pipeline.
3695 2018-04-11 17:57:59 Saddam gassed Kurds. That was very real, but in today's world being fooled with these videos is becoming easier and easier. Who benefits is those on a few sides who sell weapons, politicians, inflate oil prices. 

It’s RU / US theater based on the slaughter of Syrian civilians.
3696 2018-04-11 17:57:52 As my dad used to say "he can get where castor oil can't"!!!!
3697 2018-04-11 17:57:50 Mais nonnnnn ça rapporte beaucoup plus à l’état les camions sur les routes. À coup de 40l/ 100 de gas  oil
3698 2018-04-11 17:57:40 The Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario, too) is in the pocket of big business in general. Not limited to the oil sector.
3699 2018-04-11 17:57:31 The Government has announced it will grant no more permits for offshore oil and gas exploration in New Zealand, in a bid to tackle climate change. Onshore permits will continue to be considered in Taranaki for the next three years.
3700 2018-04-11 17:57:26 Did you see which wrestler was wearing the same cloths as the oil paining of himself hanging up on the wall during the interview? 
3701 2018-04-11 17:57:22 hi, looks like an oil painting. your doin alright
3702 2018-04-11 17:57:11 この時間からイカやるやつ人間じゃねぇ
3703 2018-04-11 17:57:10 Remember Sharon in Lebanon then his eventual Homesteading policy and his collective punishment allowing for key seizures of land. America had a hand in it as a means to put a check on the oil fields.
3704 2018-04-11 17:57:09 Hi Phil, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
3705 2018-04-11 17:57:07 My dad, a "white guy", has glioblastoma.  Cannabis Oil with specific levels of THC could prolong his life.  Sadly, it is not legal in Alabama so he cannot have this an option.  Do you know how many craps I give who the hell makes money if my dad can get the treatment?  Not one.

3708 2018-04-11 17:56:26 Might as well just wait till all the Oil is drained from our seas and every Saltire is removed and replaced with a Union Flag... or we could get off our knees and fight for independence!

3710 2018-04-11 17:56:19 Why Alaskans would elect her again, when she bailed on them when oil revenue fell off and times got@tougj, is beyond me. She’s a total failure.
3711 2018-04-11 17:56:02 trump  did that so oil prices would rise for his buddy Putin check it out it is true
3712 2018-04-11 17:55:52 all of this is horrible... and she wasn’t even “set on fire” ...hot oil was accidentally knocked over on her while she slept under a table as child...
3713 2018-04-11 17:55:51 Just returned a rental car in Orlando this past Sunday and realized I was on 1/2 tank. Took it to a gas station 1 mile from airport and those MF'ers were charging SIX FIFTY ($6.50) per gallon!! I thought maybe an oil plant had blown up but no- that was the price
3714 2018-04-11 17:55:49 Dreyer & Reinbold Racing team owner Dennis Reinbold will make an announcement concerning the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil at 2:30 p.m. ET Thursday at during an INDYCAR media teleconference.
3715 2018-04-11 17:55:49 I think that tweet applies more to the US though, and i wouldn't say it is nominally governed by millionaires, IMO it is a full blown plutocracy at this point
Jimmy Carter has even said as much
But we have problems too
"@liberal_party is and always has been in big oil`s pocket
3716 2018-04-11 17:55:46 Tell me where did these job go when the price of oil went down? Did Shell company take care of the workers? No Long term jobs? Not true. Vs extreme pollution? Solar? Wind not an option in the prairies? Why is Alberta just investing in oil?
Why are foreign companies running oil?
3717 2018-04-11 17:55:38 So today? I decide for earth take that bath and let we all oint in same oil and bath in same immortal water) i decide to share it) i dont want be alonei want all u with me in same grace

3719 2018-04-11 17:55:35 One word: Oil
3720 2018-04-11 17:55:34 winsor & newton oil paint and brushes pretty much any filbert I can find that isn’t hella cheap aha
3721 2018-04-11 17:55:33 I guess someone found more oil in Syria.
3722 2018-04-11 17:54:40 Totally agree I use my #CBD oil every day if you need me for the study I'm always willing to help
3723 2018-04-11 17:54:27 Weird question. First, no jurisdiction to make that demand. Second, unreasonable to expect such a demand. Third, point is to reduce the number of oil rail cars with a pipeline, and doesn’t necessarily mean all will be eliminated.
3724 2018-04-11 17:54:23 Turned into an amazing week oil plays, Pot yesterday, and Gold today 
stop looking in the graveyard for dead plays and go to the trades
3725 2018-04-11 17:54:21 we built this city on oil

-distant helicopter noises-
3726 2018-04-11 17:54:11 Tank testing or computer modeling what happens with bitumen without all of the environmental factors of the Salish Sea is hardly comparable to an incident that was real. Add the fact that BC marine prevention and oil recovery is decades behind for 3rd largest port in NA.
3727 2018-04-11 17:54:10 I really appreciate it! I’m just trying to get my insurance figured out, try some CBD oil and see what my options are from there!
3728 2018-04-11 17:54:08 @speculawyer so apparently PoliERA wants you to start talking about oil
3729 2018-04-11 17:54:02 I really don’t know what I was doing before micellar water, it’s so perfect after oil cleansing and also on those lazy days where you just don’t feel like doing a full wash.
3730 2018-04-11 17:53:59 We don't need to be destroying our land to get oil from it. We can buy from people who have destroyed their land
3731 2018-04-11 17:53:55 $GDX 22 and 22.5 calls paying off today. Trying to short oil since the morning spike isn't paying off much yet.
3732 2018-04-11 17:53:46 With respect, your comment about the KM pipeline and 'we all drive cars and need oil' concerns me.  This pipeline has nothing to do with our use of oil in Canada.  Please read the latest @dogwoodbc info.  It's the tankers and the risk to the Coastal First Nations!  Too high risk
3733 2018-04-11 17:53:43 If your struggling to grow you eyebrows out jamaican black Castro oil will be your new best friend 
3734 2018-04-11 17:53:39 @ShereenBhan 
All Aviation Companies in India should accumulate Crude Oil MCX Barrel Contracts as Oil has crossed 
$70/barrel,keep on rolling over.
This is a historical technical breakout which will easily take it to $120/barrel.
3735 2018-04-11 17:53:33 tea tree oil is a life saver! x
3736 2018-04-11 17:53:23 This #Avon body oil got me over here smelling good and all shiny. Got to keep the skin soft
3737 2018-04-11 17:53:15 Its quite obvious as to what is happening here. They are using the chemical attack assad did years ago as a reason to cause war. Bearing in mind Syria do not hold any form of chemical warfare. Trump wants to go up face to face with Putin on other soil. Winner takes the oil line

3739 2018-04-11 17:53:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Oil climbs while banks slip, leaving indexes little changed
3740 2018-04-11 17:52:41 The Calgary Herald reports that U of A is giving David Suzuki an honourary degree. This is shameful since he is trying so hard to shut down our oil and gas industry.
3741 2018-04-11 17:52:39 While the @DNC is wrong in many areas, even an idiot is right every once in awhile. The @GOP is just as corrupt. They love war and oil. To be fair, did you really expect @realDonaldTrump to drain the swamp overnight? Sometimes is takes weeks to kill all the roaches.
3742 2018-04-11 17:52:38 I dont think oil companies have that much problem as they earn lots of money with the help government when price is falling they are not passed those price but when price goes up they start crying
3743 2018-04-11 17:52:34 #Oil just established a new high. 5th wave is coming!
3744 2018-04-11 17:52:31 I loath the snake oil/smoke where no fire marketing
3745 2018-04-11 17:52:26 I hope it's not an oil based paint. Oil spill! Oil spill!

3752 2018-04-11 17:51:46 To compete against Premier League oil money you need to strike it lucky in the transfer market. Only Leicester have managed it before being plundered by oil-money clubs. It's a depressing situation.
3753 2018-04-11 17:51:44 @EPA Are you reporting that from the "cone of silence" or is that just for Scott Pruitt when he's blowing oil company lobbyists who come  with briefcases full of cash
3754 2018-04-11 17:51:40 @tartecosmetics Hey Tarte! As my favorite vegan makeup brand, I was wondering if you had any products or info on palm oil free products! Thanks!! xoxo - Tartelette Ally
3755 2018-04-11 17:51:28 Agreed, and by the same token we'd have to kick out big pharmaceutical, big tobacco and big oil while we're at it. #FreeTheWeed

3758 2018-04-11 17:51:25 Why dont you butt out of shit that is neither your nor russias business, or just go and HELP not bomb the fuck out of, everyone knows you just want the area for trade/oil, #donaldshouldresign

3760 2018-04-11 17:51:05 I'm sending troops to secure oil fracking sites on you as we speak
3761 2018-04-11 17:51:03 Why are we involved in Syria?
Cause our currency is based on oil.
Why war now?
We are vulnerable militarily/economically
Trump is reversing that and rebuilding our strength
For our enemies, it's now or never.
3762 2018-04-11 17:51:02 peeepin @quietplacemovie this weekend movie theaters gonna be quiet as dick but imma be coughing my ass off with these oil cartridges

3763 2018-04-11 17:50:40 When are you liberals going to wake up & realize this war was never about oil it doesn't need. It was about defeating your JV team Obama. A sophisticated, brutal terrorist organization. U. S. will be self-sufficient & exports. I know this because I follow the oil markets.
3764 2018-04-11 17:50:39 A good start would be to set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond 
RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.

3766 2018-04-11 17:50:30 No matter who is in charge of the oil it has to be sold to outside markets & is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. The global oil supply is growing at a rapid pace & the ME is losing its grip on the expanding supply from other markets.
3767 2018-04-11 17:50:29 we put proposals forward to plug the shortage but awabda blocked us. Only Allah can help Pakistan

3770 2018-04-11 17:50:22 Think oil sector is well overdue a rebound and sector should bounce a lot with Brent at this level. Above $70 all stocks seem to have moved from a negative 20 day moving average correlation to a positive one . Still discovering which MA is best for correlations .

3772 2018-04-11 17:50:18 Honestly you didn’t have to reference us, we have our own damn crude oil. 

Don’t worry about us not refining it

3796 2018-04-11 17:49:03 I see multinational corporations & foreign national oil companies plan to exploit our energy resources.  I see the promise of pipeline projects &  tanker traffic will lead to environmental harm. I see re-election, jobs & taxes are Trudeaus & Notley's priorities. #stopkindermorgan

3799 2018-04-11 17:48:41 I’ll stop now 

And yes agreed an oil strike is coming 

Bit of gas to shift at #CHAR first to set the year of the drills off nicely 

It all works at $72 all these drills were viable with oil lower 
3800 2018-04-11 17:48:41 Quebec keeps talking about wanting to secede from Canada purely because they hate people who speak English and they hate being associated with us, but if they did they would have basically no economy. Like the rest of the country, nearly all of their money comes from Alberta oil.
3801 2018-04-11 17:48:38 It's baby oil. Wrestlers discovered that decades ago.
3802 2018-04-11 17:48:38 Why then did you not tweet on that but keep tweeting about city spending oil money when the money ain't yours?  And by the way foden plays in the senior squad he can't play regularly he still has a lot to learn but time will come after all Rahford doesn't play as a regular too.
3803 2018-04-11 17:48:38 Social security is not an entitlement.  We paid intonthat find.  Military spending? Record profits for oil and gas yet theybget tax breaks and funding for development?  Wow....
3804 2018-04-11 17:48:29 I just want to slip into something more comfortable... Like a warm bath of  wintergreen oil.
3805 2018-04-11 17:48:26 I have just heard that U of A is giving David Suzuki an honourary degree. Why are they honouring this person who is doing his best to hurt our oil and gas industry. This is shameful.
3806 2018-04-11 17:48:07 Is marijuana the new fluoride? Both make ppl docile, lazy, brainfogged., & lowers IQ. #FollowThe$ #FollowTheLust4Power "John Boehner"  Cannibis oil though, is a miracle drug. Doesn't get you high, just cures whatever ails you. Many miracles have been documented.
3807 2018-04-11 17:48:06 Funny we never hear about more female voices in lumber jacking, roofing, refuse disposal, mining, oil refining, fishing, farming, construction etc... where the numbers are REALLY slanted.  Imagine that.
3808 2018-04-11 17:47:57 The Govt has just put out release saying no new offshore oil and gas exploration permits. Existing permits continue as does onshore Taranaki. Not perfect but still a big win for climate and people power
3809 2018-04-11 17:47:56 Emily I don't think I have ever told you but my dog has colon cancer.  This is his 4th bout with cancer.  He is 17 yrs old and has a low pain tolerance.  I couldn't put him through another surgery and the meds make him sick. I started making my own cannabis oil for him.
3810 2018-04-11 17:47:53 @VitaminChat I threw out the multis, won't buy more fish oil, but tradition Western and Eastern medicine providers I trust still swear by the D's. What's the what on those?
3811 2018-04-11 17:47:51 Just wondering why the U.S. and UK  won't send troops to help in the #kongo must not be enough oil there....#wakeuppeople
3812 2018-04-11 17:47:51 PepsiCo’s palm oil policy is a death sentence for endangered species. Tell PepsiCo to cut conflict palm oil for good.
3813 2018-04-11 17:47:49 Global warming is nothing less than a bunch of godless libs taking advantage of the effects of solar weather, blaming it on man to push their many snake oil companies. Its joke and a fools errand... No more no less!!!
3814 2018-04-11 17:47:43 Lol it’s funny how United have made their money and your club was purchased by a sports group that knew it wasn’t going anywhere. Crazy. Keep on w/ the oil money! Maybe you’ll sign Messi next season!

3821 2018-04-11 17:47:06 This is a shocking statistic, governments of the world, and the companies that use so much palm oil need to do more to stop this, before future generations only know what an Orangutang is through pictures

3832 2018-04-11 17:46:11 Everything Horgan is bring up has already been done under Christy Clarks administration and if the BC NDP want the benefits of oil, they have to pay their share of the costs.Nothings for free.
3833 2018-04-11 17:46:10 All men should at least know how to change a tire. And do an oil change
3834 2018-04-11 17:46:08 BREAKING NEWS: Energy Dept. cites a huge drop in US heating oil & gas use from winter to summer.

3840 2018-04-11 17:45:30 @Conservatives Just watching the violence & brutality in Congo.  But yeah know, we won’t bother givin government aid coz it’s all going the OIL RICH Middle East
3841 2018-04-11 17:45:22 There’s plenty of evidence for this. You’re plainly not interested in learning the truth. Do you have investments or perhaps a salary from the oil industry? Blocked
3842 2018-04-11 17:45:18 Also feels like energy is playing a role as such a big part of the junk space. The geopolitical oil and xle rip is really helping out that piece of the market
3843 2018-04-11 17:45:17 Great aspirations:)
Would love to see even more items with zero palm oil to offer more consumer choice; a 'palm oil- free' labelling system with education about the negative effects of palm oil plantations on both human lives, biodiversity and deforestation.
3844 2018-04-11 17:45:12 How does your position help poor people avoid high gas and heating oil prices?
3845 2018-04-11 17:45:01 shortage of gas is the least of your problems. What about water
3846 2018-04-11 17:44:57 Do you believe in a reasonable translation time , or are you simply against using oil and natural resources altogether ?#BuildKM
3847 2018-04-11 17:44:41 Your attitude personifies the culture of entitlement that makes trusting government so difficult.  Clearly the oil companies own you.  Not good.
3848 2018-04-11 17:44:41 Owing to the extensive use of machinery, or for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.

3851 2018-04-11 17:44:19 Get your facts ASSAD has never killed anyone,but because US EN ISRAEL wants oil rich golan heights of SYRIA they fabricate nonsense
3852 2018-04-11 17:44:12 It’s 1:45 & with both kids I already... 

• made breakfast
• got an oil change 
• got things from Costco
• had lunch 
• started laundry 
• cleaned up the garage 

Plus I have fed the baby three times which takes a while itself. 

So it’s not too early for wine, right?
3853 2018-04-11 17:44:12 Wow me too! I finished my main engine lube oil system drawing already and my deck equipment drawing as well!
3854 2018-04-11 17:44:08 To President Trump
Mr President remember what Mohammed Buhari & Boko Haram did to America on 25th December 2009, Boko Haram terrorists took bomb into Delta Airliner over the state of Michigan to blow it up. Mr President time to cut off Boko Haram funding has come. Biafra oil
3855 2018-04-11 17:43:53 If you aren't moisturizing your daily with something like vitamin E coconut oil, you're literally cucking your skin and you're going to turn into a wrinkly old sack when you get older
3856 2018-04-11 17:43:46 Yeah. So than wouldn't it be safe to assume that building a pipeline would have no impact on demand. Rather than fighting the oil patch shiuldn't you be placing your energy on demand drives. Auto's, manufacturing, shipping...
3857 2018-04-11 17:43:44 we don't need foreign oil.  We have more than enough to last your lifetime
3858 2018-04-11 17:43:43 Let me get an oil change before wilding out tn
3859 2018-04-11 17:43:41 Ms.May is ok with subsidizing the economy of USA. Canada is forced to sell its oil cheaply to the US and Ms.May rejoices over that fact!  What a joke she is. Complete joke.

3861 2018-04-11 17:43:30 They're kind of weird. They look like plain nuts. No skin. No oil. No seasoning. Nothing. But the flavor is apparently infused and you get a nice pickle after taste
3862 2018-04-11 17:43:27 Bio oil
3863 2018-04-11 17:43:15 There are some cultures who believe big women are a symbol of status. I believe there’s a story, of olive oil. A man was determined by several things: how much his wife weighed, how much/grade olive oil, his wives allowed to absorb in the fried patties of , & to bathe with.
3864 2018-04-11 17:43:13 I think it is not. He put false assumptions and argued about them. See how he mentioned TOWs and tied them directly to Russian intervention then concluded that escalation is not good. Seriously? Then how us managed to control oil fields and Turkey controls Afrin
3865 2018-04-11 17:42:59 You don't seem to grasp what the scientific evidence is screaming: OIL/GAS/PLASTIC IS KILLING THE PLANET.
Clinging to pipelines means there won't be any prosperity for ANYONE.
Get it yet???
3866 2018-04-11 17:42:54 Good, turn the oil companies' delay game around onto them instead. We've waited too many decades for #ClimateActionNow.

3867 2018-04-11 17:42:34 @realDonaldTrump consider the tweet about a great future for $BTC, the community will appreciate it 
I heard it worked with oil
3868 2018-04-11 17:42:30 Does that mean you don’t sell ANY item that contain palm oil?
3869 2018-04-11 17:42:26 Slicker than a oil spill sharper than a razor .
3870 2018-04-11 17:42:26 I have decided to get an oil change in my unkillable Toyota. This will be the first maintenance in almost 2 years. Damn thing refuses to die. Rather like my liver.
3871 2018-04-11 17:42:15 That's good news! Consumer choice for more palm oil free items would be a great additional step... I do buy from Aldi but only items that are free from palm oil.
3872 2018-04-11 17:42:12 Let the pipeline supporters drink oil
3873 2018-04-11 17:42:11 @the huntley Hi Catherine & Alexis, I couldn't live without almond oil and adore all divine products...especially serum & moisturiser..I het asked almost every day why my skin is glowing! Thank you QVC, Teenaxx

3876 2018-04-11 17:42:07 The best thing about @StopKM is that it messes with Texas, and Alberta in one important step.
#ClimateActionNow
Please start looking for other ways to build your economy that doesn't depend on burning oil.
3877 2018-04-11 17:42:03 Sorry it will not only change the oil equation but make India a oil and gas behemoth!! The crude needs to be tapped locally also and Aramco technology will provide a big impetus!!
3878 2018-04-11 17:41:57 Palm oil is in absolutely everything here! You have to read labels very carefully.
3879 2018-04-11 17:41:52 Not while there is oil in the ground #notinmyname

3882 2018-04-11 17:41:45 i just want it to get warmer so i can use the tanning oil that smells like coconut 
3883 2018-04-11 17:41:41 Can oil and water mix?
3884 2018-04-11 17:41:40 #oott hard to see oil not rallying into the close
3885 2018-04-11 17:41:34 20 for bean oil? That's pretty ambitious target, I guess!
3886 2018-04-11 17:41:33 Therefore I think saying "everyone" is long is at best immeasurable, at worst very wrong. Given oil probably spends the most time of any commodity in backwardation (& in this age of stale speculative long ETFs), relying on CFTC oil data is dangerous at the moment IMHO (2/2)

3898 2018-04-11 17:39:50 Why are you fingering Oil? 
3899 2018-04-11 17:39:44 Hey Mandy, the replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

3902 2018-04-11 17:39:32 Shea Moisture doesn’t actually have a water based moisturizer but I would suggest you use what works for you. It helps cut down on oil production on your face. Garnier Skin Active works best for me for the price.
3903 2018-04-11 17:39:31 Giving the NDP control of our oil resources really frightens me. What will stop them from tying transportation to carbon targets and limiting production?
3904 2018-04-11 17:39:27 The block button parade continues. Why on earth would you want advice from someone who doesn’t use a chart and thinks they are snake oil and useless? 
3905 2018-04-11 17:39:26 “The problem with Thatcherism is that you eventually run out of North Sea oil money.”

3913 2018-04-11 17:38:21 I receive quite a few versions of "Why won't you answer me?" requests from folks selling security snake oil. Hmmm... Right. Responding is exactly what not to do. Let me introduce you to my friends Dev and Null.
3914 2018-04-11 17:38:16 Higher oil prices does not hurt Russian or American economies. The so-called syrian rebels were Al Qaeda & ISIS armed by Hussein & HRC. This is likely a move to wipe them out.
3915 2018-04-11 17:38:08 Now, let me see your hands *takes your hands in hers and inspected them closely* I'll need to file them all, and give them an oil bath... you need to use lotion my dear
3916 2018-04-11 17:38:03 Yeah, Zuckerberg is the answer to the age old questions of "What would you get as spawn if Data mated with Skynet from the Terminator and she drank a lot of high octane oil while carrying".
3917 2018-04-11 17:38:01 yep @LexFuturus will like this - we have 5-10 years of process work and data clean up (oops i meant "AI") to get to things being easier. In it for the hard yards. I loved this deck. would love to have heard in person.  oh and fighting off the snake oil sales folk.
3918 2018-04-11 17:37:55 If South Africa had been rich in oil, and situated in a strategic zone that allowed for free flow of this fossil fuel, the USA have invaded us and told the world that Mandela is a War Criminal...

3920 2018-04-11 17:37:50 All this excessive slobbering over immigrants legal and otherwise implies native Americans are inferior, incapable and just in the way.

3926 2018-04-11 17:37:31 Trump should decimate any military they encounter including Russia. After the attack on Syria the US should take control of the oil pipeline to Europe. The us should then establish safe zones on the land and no fly zones in the air. Trump should be “in Putin’s face.”
3927 2018-04-11 17:37:02 Bottom line: how do we get the oil

3941 2018-04-11 17:36:06 Clearly $1.5 billion for coastal protection, ethical oil, billions in economic revenue and good, high quality - good paying jobs mean nothing. BTW the existing pipeline has been there for decades... #Cdnpoli #fantasyland

3962 2018-04-11 17:33:45 @deepriversnacks, I see your chips are #NonGMO verified, but they’re cooked in sunflower oil.  Any idea if that oil is from herbicide resistant sunflowers? I’m tempted to stop buying them because of the meaningless #NonGMO label.

3964 2018-04-11 17:33:40 I think the @IcelandFoods palm oil pledge is interesting. I guess it’s easier for them to achieve than most retailers due to the majority of products being frozen 
3965 2018-04-11 17:33:31 True Pundit is in no way shape or form equivalent to an int’l news organization. It has nothing to do with their obvious editorial slant. It also doesn’t mean they don’t ever publish some accurate info. But relying on that as an authority would be like relying on snake oil.

3973 2018-04-11 17:32:24 I got mad after i spilled the oil so ima go eat somewhere lol
3974 2018-04-11 17:32:23 It is interesting that a Congressman is asking if Facebook is growing too big, kind of like ATT and some other oil company.  Funny how the government is allowing ATT to merge and grow larger when it was divided up in the past for a reason.
3975 2018-04-11 17:32:20 So now a shithole country will become the battle ground for all that oil. Had to find a country w/lots of oil destroy it along with innocents for your greed. Genie Energy
3976 2018-04-11 17:32:12 The oil price surging on reports of a rocket intercepted over Riyadh is a reminder that the oil cartel has a vested interest in a middle east war.
3977 2018-04-11 17:32:11 @Noble_Jim listening to Chocolate talk about changing gears at the track during practice makes me cringe. Memories of burning my arms and my clothes smelling like a mix of sweat, and gear oil() I used to try to mask the smell with race fuel. 
3978 2018-04-11 17:31:59 Oh no. Hope it is not as bad as that MG which dropped oil everywhere before lunch.
3979 2018-04-11 17:31:58 Is anyone of you are sick! He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well: the Lord will rise him up.     —James 5:14-15

3985 2018-04-11 17:30:48 Don’t forget that this oil delusional fool has aspirations of higher political ambitions!
3986 2018-04-11 17:30:44 The fact is also, that the Irish govt and the EU allowed a token bribe. Its absolutely routine, has been for decades. Oil companies, banks, frackers, they all do it all the time. Its considered acceptable loss and a continuing part of tax evasion.
3987 2018-04-11 17:30:37 They all probably called each other to discuss when to exit gold and oil longs. lol
3988 2018-04-11 17:30:30 I grease my door handles with every oil change so I don’t forget. It’s important.

3992 2018-04-11 17:30:12 ... There's a republican from texas who is talking about Facebook in regards to Monopolies needing to be broken up a la Standard Oil and I'm like... who let this one in?

4002 2018-04-11 17:29:38 The oil being sent through BC won’t be refined and bought back. That oil goes to the Gulf coast. This oil will be shipped to Asia which has high demand.
4003 2018-04-11 17:29:24 Why do people think that they can try and screw over women when it comes to selling them stuff for cars... getting oil changed today and guy told me I HAD to have the most expensive oil... didn’t like it when I called him out that No, I really didn’t!
4004 2018-04-11 17:29:16 Nope it’s correct ,I literally work in the Oilfield and have worked in heavy and light oil. So it is about tanker traffic? Well it’s not like any of us are going to dramatically shift our views so I’m going to get back to work.

4009 2018-04-11 17:28:51 Great points. Underlying hypothesis clearly perpetuate the interests of big oil – still significant role for fossil fuel on the long run, CCS as the silver climate bullet, huge growth in energy demand, etc. And ultimately question the magnitude/nature of the decarbonization.

4015 2018-04-11 17:28:43 Maybe he was complaining that the wholesale price of olive oil had gone up, and his sales were dropping because his customers were worried about the effect of #Brexit on their jobs and pockets?

Only joking #FinalSay #StopBrexit #ABTV #WATON #FBPE #follow5001
4016 2018-04-11 17:28:36 Can FB change the oil in my boat?
4017 2018-04-11 17:28:07 Show this to the olive oil spot and get it crackin.
4018 2018-04-11 17:28:06 My dad taught me how to change a tire, change my oil, and so much more. I couldn’t drive until I learned all that 
4019 2018-04-11 17:28:01 The thing is, there is literally no other reason for us to really be in the middle east anymore, oil reserves in America, Shale Oil becoming more common, etc.
There is no logical reason to stay

So this collusion shit is all about oil? 

Me thinks we need to find an alternate fuel source.
4022 2018-04-11 17:27:49 Barrel bombs are primitive but deadly, usually oil drum or similar container filled with explosives, crude munitions forbidden by international law
4023 2018-04-11 17:27:48 You do realise your arguing over fully grown men loaded with steroids rubbing baby oil over them selves and then pretending to hit each other
4024 2018-04-11 17:27:48 right, Republicans only see federal govt as the solution when it comes to having military bases all over the world, giving subsidies to oil companies & corporations, cutting taxes for the rich, outlawing drugs including pot, forbidding business with Cuba,& spying on Americans.
4025 2018-04-11 17:27:36 Do you use Oil, Top? I mean do you use electricity and drive and fly and buy products that require manufacture from oil? How do you plan on getting the oil from one place to another?
4026 2018-04-11 17:27:35 ah but not so late that it negates the fact that there was a "formal working relationship" between Cohen & the firm representing Cambridge Analytica & lobbyists for a Russian oil company BEFORE this announcement.
4027 2018-04-11 17:27:31 BS. Drill for that oil and dont let up anytime soon

4034 2018-04-11 17:27:01 Crude oil price increase directly increases Nigeria’s revenue. Likewise, it increases how much I spend on fuel. It’s selfish but I prefer low crude oil prices.
4035 2018-04-11 17:26:58 Saudi Aramco, world's biggest oil company, announced a $44-billion deal to build a giant refinery complex in India with 3 Indian oil majors
4036 2018-04-11 17:26:56 But SWN never officially left until oil prices dropped
Once the Liberal government seen that the industry was going nowhere, they suddenly reverted back to their previous position of opposing fracking. Such a pack of liars 
Ugh
4037 2018-04-11 17:26:47 We’d be absolutely insane to not bring in a proper partner for Van Dijk this summer. It’d be like buying a Rolls Royce and putting crap used tires on it and using conventional oil.

4053 2018-04-11 17:24:38 Ironic thing to post. Most of your oil company supporters block the sale of E85. If retailers weren't blocked from selling it, imagine how much ethanol the flex fuel vehicle owners could absorb?!

Oil hasn't been cheaper.
Look into this Trump
4057 2018-04-11 17:24:11  but it has a hold of 10. Try the Argan Oil or the Flaxseed then, I think those are stronger

4074 2018-04-11 17:22:52 Bizarrely, I got into a discussion with a leaver about olive oil on a stall I did back in November. I had no idea what he was talking about other than he was clearly very upset about what the EU was doing. Maybe it’s a fake news story we have missed 
4075 2018-04-11 17:22:51 We’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change too!

4078 2018-04-11 17:22:29 This is good news and well done @IcelandFoods for taking this step. Can't help but wonder what palm oil is being replaced with? #justasking
4079 2018-04-11 17:22:21 I'm not a liberal voter... But I disagree with the pipelines. Will be more fossil fuels be burnt into the air at a shorter time. Public health is more important than money in the oil companies pockets.
4080 2018-04-11 17:22:15 Nota bene: The success of austerity conmen selling supply-side snake oil, like Paul Ryan, relies heavily on a media environment that frames Joe Plumber-type small business owner tyrants as part of "the working class."
4081 2018-04-11 17:22:14 oil is moving pretty much up every day. i can remeber some weeks like this one.

4087 2018-04-11 17:21:39 @realDonaldTrump could ya do something about the price of oil? Fuel prices are bad. Nearing the 2008 mark.
4088 2018-04-11 17:21:36 Try burning chips. They burn due to the oil content in them. Few years ago there were rumours that they had plastic in it.

All it took was getting the egotistical greedy moron #Trump elected President. War is on the horizon.  The defense contractors and oil companies can't wait.
4094 2018-04-11 17:21:02 Jesus Christ your bullshit never ends , Ca is 3 rd or 4th , literally all the fuel for BC coastal area comes from Burnaby refinery which is 100 %fed from AB oil , Vancouver Airport and Ferries 100 % Kinder Morgan.Inland all Alberta Oil.

4098 2018-04-11 17:20:19 so you're saying that economic growth only happens when we cut down trees or drill for oil
4099 2018-04-11 17:20:09 coconut oil or olive oil
4100 2018-04-11 17:20:02 So Obama never got involved? How about dood-frank, ACA, demonizing oil companies, giving loans to failed solyndra, intrusive EPA rules, the IRS scandal, and many others?
4101 2018-04-11 17:19:59 And CNBC's worst show is kind enough to give us stock tips:

$PSX - refinery, as oil surges and economy slows? 
$MU - cause fallen stars recover in days, in tech of all sectors?

4104 2018-04-11 17:19:33 So If the Lower Mainland does not want oil and gas Products. Would you be fine with refusing 100% of the Oil and Gas Revenue from NEBC and 100% of Transfer Payments from Alberta. I would love to see how you would afford to pay for the new bridge that was built & the proposed one
4105 2018-04-11 17:19:23 The Anastasia stick foundation is great. I have a dry face and I mix some primer oil in w it and it works amazing!
4106 2018-04-11 17:19:17 Replace palm oil w/ soybean oil which requires lands 10 times of what palm oil does. Demolish milions of hectares of oil palm estate which has the capacity equal to secondary forest to absorb CO2 from - to produce and release O2 into - polluted atmosphere. Wisdom of the West !

4121 2018-04-11 17:18:09 Donald and Vlad are putting on a show.
They'll blow up our soldiers to make it look like they're both "being tough."
Then they'll laugh and laugh and continue to funnel money and oil.

Wagging the dog is too calm a phrase.
4122 2018-04-11 17:17:48 Then if Russia doesn’t want a war(but we all know they do) then why are they in Syria?  Oil
4123 2018-04-11 17:17:37 Well $ati is considered a gas stock for one.   I said oil lol
4124 2018-04-11 17:17:35 Oil is moving on geopolitical stress. That can change in a heartbeat.
4125 2018-04-11 17:17:35 This lip oil is hands down the very best! It’s amazing
4126 2018-04-11 17:17:34 Oil now 72 dollars a barrel. Guess what it won't make a blind bit of difference to Scotland, even if it was  200 dollars a barrel.
4127 2018-04-11 17:17:28 Is necessary a new organization to compite with the #OPEC to bring stability and fair trade to the oil worldwide. One integrate by the #Mexico #US #Canada #Uk #Norway will bring stability to the crude prices
4128 2018-04-11 17:17:13 Yeah, the Hollywood giveaways are so much more egregious than oil subsidies, vehicle subsidies (including Boeing), technology subsidies, etc. You dishonest prick. Disney gets the biggest subsidies in "Hollywood," and they're 46th on the list of biggest subsidy giveaways.

4136 2018-04-11 17:16:42 @Thom_Hartmann The mission of Gulf war ONE was to stop Iraq from selling oil cheap using the Pipe line through Kuwait to the Persian Gulf  to regain control of the price of Carlyle (BushCo) Saudi Arabian oil and bankrupt the people of the world with the price of oil.

4139 2018-04-11 17:16:38 Why does Russia care so much about Syria, is it because Middle East instability causes the oil price to soar? #Russia #Syria
4140 2018-04-11 17:16:37 No it isn't. If that were the case, BC wouldn't be using that and ocean as a toilet. It's about landlocking AB oil and screwing all Canadians out of jobs and money. You do realize that foreign investors are watching and will not be investing in Canada, right?
4141 2018-04-11 17:16:33 She will drink the oil. Lmao someone tag trump and president of india

4152 2018-04-11 17:15:20 $70 well spent. Someone else will do the oil change and do the 4k mile check up too.
4153 2018-04-11 17:15:14 Hopefully her oil pan isnt gone 
4154 2018-04-11 17:15:12 Please don’t pretend that you have any interest in preserving public lands. You have betrayed Utahns and Americans by selling out to oil, gas, and coal interests. This is not about education but about corporate profits.

4159 2018-04-11 17:14:47 Not all sources of contamination in the ocean come from just oil, trash and solid wastes. The dumping of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, industrial race (such as heavy metals and acids), and drained sewage are also heavy contributors to pollution. #jmsshpa12

4163 2018-04-11 17:14:16 Syria doesnt have that much oil; it a proxy fight between the US and Russia, Shite and Sunni...control of European market is at stake. Syria is a transmission country.
4164 2018-04-11 17:14:13 All you need to know about Syria; Iran has lots of oil, and the best way to move it westwards, is in a pipeline through Syria. US and UK etc want to lay waste to Iran and Syria, then take their oil. They really don't care one bit about ordinary Syrian people. The end #Syriawar
4165 2018-04-11 17:14:08 India's Oil Minister Says Oil Prices Are 'Too High'
4166 2018-04-11 17:13:57 Not that considering the move in Oil.
4167 2018-04-11 17:13:56 I guess if you pump oil stocks since October, you're bound to get it right eventually? Jmas = p.o.s.
4168 2018-04-11 17:13:54 And yet, if it was refined in Canada, it could be used in Canada and we would avoid the cost and pollution from shipping crude out only to import oil back.  But, I expect many might say that jobs of many working on ships and docks would be lost.
4169 2018-04-11 17:13:35 @CNNMoney thank you for drawing attention to the plight of the Rainforests and the trail of destruction the use of palm oil leaves behind.

4183 2018-04-11 17:12:23 Why are Republicans enamored with removing species from the endangered species list ? 
1) it removes protections of the habitat which opens it up to the oil and gas industry 
2) Lobbyist dollars from the oil and gas industry
3) pressure from the NRA 
4) all of the above.
4184 2018-04-11 17:12:20 @WWE must be trying to get Saudi Arabia oil or something. Why is that card so stacked?

4186 2018-04-11 17:12:10 Yes! Now can we stop consuming palm oil?
4187 2018-04-11 17:11:56 there is no discourse because the wall street gamblers are all in just like they were back in 2008.  Only thing left is to watch the consumer fall back as oil burns through their bank accounts.
4188 2018-04-11 17:11:46 Ouchie! I wish I could give you some of my jojoba and vitamin e oil for it.
4189 2018-04-11 17:11:41 Better to appreciate now and create headspace for the next devaluation when oil prices correct.
4190 2018-04-11 17:11:37 I live in BC I used to work in the oil &gas industry in Grande Prairie So I  &my entire family extended family support the pipelines.

4197 2018-04-11 17:11:02 War is good for Oil. However Syria has lots of it and to the victor goes to spoils. Russia and US to split their fields down the middle tanking oil price with supply. Lol far out prediction I know but worst case im completely wrong and nbd.

4199 2018-04-11 17:10:46 And it is NOT about health of the planet vs profits!  Production, transport, and export of oil means jobs, health care, an adequate standard of living, and all the things YOU expect. So take your phony argument somewhere else (although @TorontoStar is certainly the rag for you).

4212 2018-04-11 17:09:49 Perhaps though in thought. If Americans saw what decades of their tax dollars went to destroying other countries and millions killed, just to control oil. That if their cities looked that way, they'd understand wars. Wars based on total lies.
4213 2018-04-11 17:09:41 Nah. It has more to do with an oil pipeline than anything else. Why the hell does Russia care about Syria? Oil.  Always OIL.
4214 2018-04-11 17:09:37 Oil for blood
4215 2018-04-11 17:09:34 Ps- “sunset industry”? Oil demand is up and will be for a few years yet. 2018 est is up 100,000 BPD over 2017. Facts matter.
4216 2018-04-11 17:09:31 $OIL 7.58 long I think crude keeps running.

4219 2018-04-11 17:09:17 As always Jeremy Corbyn is proving he's an MP with principles and what does Syria have that Iraq also has Oil. Stinking shitty Tory's
4220 2018-04-11 17:09:10 If increased gas prices is what it takes to get BC out of their cars and focused on transportation alternatives, so be it. Enough of the oil $$ greed, we want clean air and water!
4221 2018-04-11 17:09:04 Weak auctions. Hotter CPI. Oil spike. There may come a point where fundamentals overwhelm crowded positioning in treasuries. War premium for the day already gone. Shorts have to be scared to cover. And price action not scary to this point given headlines. Just my 2 cents.
4222 2018-04-11 17:08:52 .@Walmart BEWARE-MY MOM TOOK HER CAR IN FOR OIL CHANGE-20 MILES LATER CAR DIES-NO OIl. CLAIM DENIED. WON'T SHOW US VIDEO

4224 2018-04-11 17:08:43 my friends often say to me “you know you really look different in pictures than you do in real life” and honestly it’s so frustrating because my true essence can only be captured in oil paintings or marble sculptures 
4225 2018-04-11 17:08:40 Jab kachcha oil itana sasta h to petrol ki keemat kyo upar ho rhi h
4226 2018-04-11 17:08:40 How absolutely stupid. Oil will be produced and consumed - in ever-increasing amounts.  If Canada does not provide it, it will come from the US or Russia or Iran or Iraq or Saudi Arabia or Venezuela or Nigeria or wherever! So forget your high and mighty holier-than-thou attitude!
4227 2018-04-11 17:08:27 one of the most vivid dreams i've ever had was me & barney getting murdered by my parents dressed up like cartoon gangsters. they put us in oil drums & hucked us in the river hey

Step back from the brink and be the better man.

If they did use gas bombs, let them be prosecuted by the UN.

If they didn't, billions will die for a lie.

4252 2018-04-11 17:06:52 Until we get more pipeline capacity and a better price for our oil it will probably stay this way.
4253 2018-04-11 17:06:38 That’s a poorly researched bit of fantasy.  Fuel prices are non-competitive due to huge taxes and industry constraints.  FYI, why are environmentalists not up in arms because foreign oil imports are exempt (not a typo) from most Cdn. emissions regulations?  Do your homework.

4257 2018-04-11 17:06:11 Exactly right. I have been arguing in columns for the past 5 years that the global energy system is rapidly changing - inc. oil and gas markets - and that AB needs to wake up and change with it.

We hope that by supporting the signing of the Oil contract with Uganda, the international community  won't loose its focus on the fact that Uganda is a dictatorship which the US should review it's policies and dealings with.

4328 2018-04-11 16:59:15 Right and this is Trump's plan. Sell our oil, coal and natural gas to those countries instead of the middle east and Russia and eliminate their money source. Also the reset and going back to the gold standard will hopefully leave them penniless.

It's a moral hazard to fund oil industry and pick winners and losers in this field. Let the market decide and not politicians.
4333 2018-04-11 16:58:56 Idiots.  Not building pipelines means oil gets transported by train.  More expensive, more risk of spills, but oil still gets developed and used.

4350 2018-04-11 16:57:10 America wouldn't be involved if there wasn't a profit. my guess is to display military power, and obtain oil or other conspired/lucrative operations (ex. afghan heroin trade)
4351 2018-04-11 16:56:52 And that's awesome if it helps them. But there are toddlers that need the specifically formulated CBD oil for seizures, that the guy down the street can't make. That's why there needs to be some form of regulation. Maybe not on the federal level, I can give you that.
4352 2018-04-11 16:56:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

4355 2018-04-11 16:56:40 Nifty 50 formed hanging man on daily charts.

4356 2018-04-11 16:56:37 Palm oil produced 5 X the oil per unit of land than any other plant oil used for the same purpose. If you just ban it, then food producers will look to other crops which will need far more land to produce the equivalent amount of oil..
4357 2018-04-11 16:56:35 They've always had an agenda.. if I could come back across some of the articles I read, going back to the 30s and 40s I believe, they were wanting to reorganize the countries in the ME... I think it's always been an oil and shipments thing.. I'd even go as far to say mines also
4358 2018-04-11 16:56:25 I'm no expert on the matter, but putting new oil in seems like it's approximately 50% of the job when doing an oil change.
4359 2018-04-11 16:56:21 Back in 2012, Paul Ryan was the future of Republican party. Uh, it looks like your future just retired and left town. My vote on his replacement has to go to snake oil salesmen McMorris Rodgers, she’s slicker than a Keystone pipeline leak!
4360 2018-04-11 16:56:15 Let's transport oil by train instead, blow up more towns, burn people to a horrible death instead of building a pipeline.
4361 2018-04-11 16:56:05 So crude becomes a range bound play going forward 35 on downside and 70 USD on upside lower range takes high cost basins out of game and high range brings everybody in the game of pumping oil leading to excess supply in short it will be sideways for a long time to come
4362 2018-04-11 16:55:58 Pls don’t speak to me if you think that offshore drilling or fracking are perfectly safe ways of extracting oil and never in danger of failing, leaking, or exploding. It’s not a thing, that doesn’t exist, they ALWAYS fail at some point so don’t come to me with that bs
4363 2018-04-11 16:55:52 I'm glad we moved here when we did. Everything is priced more reasonably for everyone. Aberdeen was always priced for oil and gas.
4364 2018-04-11 16:55:43 Look closely at the sign - it's made from oil products.
4365 2018-04-11 16:55:37 Stay out of the oil patch. Millenials hate fossil fuels.
4366 2018-04-11 16:55:22 Technically Liverpool have 18, only Man United have more league titles and they didn’t need oil money to buy them.  I’ve also seen my club win European Cups. No City fan has seen that.

4370 2018-04-11 16:54:52 Ha! I'm not the only one that Mr. Lube had fucked over. Just heard a co-worker describe how Mr. Lube forgot to put oil back into his neighbour's car on the weekend and nearly destroyed the engine. They did that to me too! #FuckMrLube

4378 2018-04-11 16:54:12 Not for us to keep. To stop them from selling oil to fund $$$ their radicalization and caliphate.  Takes a lot of money to build a caliphate. Geez.

4397 2018-04-11 16:52:20 It's ok. I get that you'd rather argue then acknowledge the validity to my argument. 
At the end of the day, the likelihood of an oil spill is a once a century event. Working together could even decrease that. Too bad you guys are too busy rattling your Sabres.

4408 2018-04-11 16:51:17 It was not a monopoly before the government intervened. Standard Oil's percent of the refining market peaked around ~1870 and fell continuously after that. Combined with falling prices for its product is pretty good evidence that it wasn't a monopoly.
4409 2018-04-11 16:51:05 Judging not by the rhetoric but the dynamic, the US and Russian teams want a scrimmage in a free fire zone nobody gaf about, to settle this Golan Heights Oil lease issue. It's likely to redefine collateral damage.

4413 2018-04-11 16:50:43 Right, when Bush was there, it was oil also.  Trump has changed that by getting rid of Obama's policies.  That's why Trump always said, why didn't we take their oil, at least?

4416 2018-04-11 16:50:27 If Cda’s carbon budget is fixed & AB’s oil sector has a pass to >C emissions & if feds require that be made up elsewhere, is that fair? AB to get a greater share of declining C budget, others must curtail growth; cut ff use more deeply; or penalize their economy w a C tax.

4431 2018-04-11 16:49:24 @GabbyDarko Dr Ahorsu of LECIAD has just alleged that the Kufuor government agreed to have a base in 2007 after we struck oil and you wrote an article (to Mills) convincing him of the need to heed to the plans left behind for a base to protect the oil we have. Any response?
4432 2018-04-11 16:49:24 Next in number of quotation after cabbages are "all kinds of legumes" ,also without oil but sometimes "soaked/dipped in water" or boiled (in the parenthesis are mentioned various legumes)

4477 2018-04-11 16:45:19 Alberta needs to show that it can accept responsibility for the damage it causes transporting oil and immediately fund Lac Megantic survivors. No more freeloading on neighbors.
4478 2018-04-11 16:45:08 (4) How often do pipelines leak? How often do trucks crash? How often do trains derail? How much damage do trains do when they derail (remember Lac Megantic?) How much damage do trucks do (if the one in SK had been filled with oil there'd be no survivors)? Take your pick.
4479 2018-04-11 16:44:36 Couldn’t that logic also apply to you? That is “The only parents I know that are fine with it have kids in education so their motive is mute.” Just because someone  is in oil or education doesn’t make their opinion invalid.
4480 2018-04-11 16:44:31 In allowing more pollution from vehicle emissions,Trump and Pruitt care more about the oil industry than the public. The auto industry is doing fine under current standards with 6 years of record profits.
4481 2018-04-11 16:44:19 Anything other than being short oil on technicals/momentum over very specific timeframes is a pain trade, bad RR. Same as Gold. We are at that point in the cycle + geopolitics will not get any less volatile

4488 2018-04-11 16:43:20 Excellent example of delegation of Power. This also reflects on high priority being accorded to Oil and Gas sector by Honourable PM under leadership of our Petroleum Minister
4489 2018-04-11 16:43:13 I’m talking about my personal experience & related opinions, you are eluding that I don’t know what I’m talking about. Have you lived in Sask., AB & BC? Worked in legal in oil sands and international ventures in O&G? Worked for BC govt? Lived with a view of the Van inlet? I have!
4490 2018-04-11 16:43:10 2/2 As renewables come on stream, tar sands may be least favoured oil due to price. Could become stranded asset. Better to get it sold before that happens. Therefore, build T-M and refinery capacity to capture ALL the Econ benefits. In AB’s interest.

4495 2018-04-11 16:42:57 Wow my car drives so much better with things like oil and air in the tires Wooooow who knew
4496 2018-04-11 16:42:57 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.... gee I wander who will gain control of this when the bombs and guns stop....
4497 2018-04-11 16:42:49 Isn't the oil sold to BC buy private companies? How does Alberta have jurisdiction over chevron?
4498 2018-04-11 16:42:44 Ahhh I’m in so much pain right now! I want to go straight home after work but I have to take my little car for an oil change and new brakes first 
4499 2018-04-11 16:42:30 I agree that the major of us that work in or support the oil and gas industry, heck those of us that support the responsible extraction of our all natural resources,  are environmentalists.
4500 2018-04-11 16:42:26 @JustinTrudeau - Mr.  Prime Minister.  If you allow or support Alberta choking off oil to British Columbia you and your party will loose us in the next election.  You may want to consider working with BC to resolve this rather than supporting Alberta in this course.
4501 2018-04-11 16:42:22 Load of old bollocks don’t believe the hype, they’ve been itching to get at Syria for years it must be oil rich
4502 2018-04-11 16:42:18 Just QUIT using palm oil all together. It destroys the planet and animals. It's even pretty freaking unhealthy for humans - carcinogenic

It all worked out just well before everyone started using palm oil

4504 2018-04-11 16:42:16 You ever notice how most countries who lose their State owned Oil end up poorer for the privilege.

When will people learn.
4505 2018-04-11 16:42:12 Falling inventories well-established now. Should mean higher oil prices but market believes $60-$65 WTI sufficient to maintain supply. Either inventories will rise to meet low price expectations or perception of market clearing price for supply will rise to meet CI basics.

4509 2018-04-11 16:41:50 This is a common situation around the world. And perhaps the 1963 decision to put SFU next to a pre-existing refinery and oil terminal was the error.
4510 2018-04-11 16:41:50 Why should Russia be interested in Iran’s oil and gas profits? 
They want to sell their own goods.

4513 2018-04-11 16:41:40 I don't know really. Again that is for the courts and government to decide. But that decision should be made with facts. Not with evidence free hyperbole that equates #Fukushima with a coastal oil spill here
4514 2018-04-11 16:41:27 I’m so over this weather all it does is turn my face into an oil slick and make me break out
4515 2018-04-11 16:41:27 I have a feeling a lot of the support for JKay is because people believe he will be able to get the Alberta Oil & Gas Industry running like it did around '06.  I'd like to know how they think he will do that.  #ableg #abpoli

4528 2018-04-11 16:40:54 For real! It hasn’t shed the rest of the fat, but specifically belly fat and waist size. Make sure it’s Ceylon because Cassia (the normal one in the USA) can give you liver cancer. I buy from Druera. I also have been taking a spoon of coconut oil in the AM.

4539 2018-04-11 16:40:06 Machine oil or tar?
4540 2018-04-11 16:40:02 I do have one! But the kind of oil I bought said it doesn’t need to be blended. It just said stir it in 
4541 2018-04-11 16:39:57 My initial message was regarding your reply that oil only was 3% of our economy! Yet Alberta’s oil is the main reason why they have to contribute & not receive. Your previous message seem to disagree. Apologies if I misunderstood
4542 2018-04-11 16:39:54 Basically the result after every oil change I get: “Ma’am we changed your oil! Also we found that if you don’t change your tires, engine, transmission, and everything else in your car then it’s going to explode. We’d be happy to do all that for you today for 5 million dollars!”
4543 2018-04-11 16:39:31 Just had to duck the oil man on Chestnut street. 
4544 2018-04-11 16:39:26 1/2 But seriously, why wouldn’t AB build refineries & the pipeline to guarantee access to Pacific mkts &  no-discount product? Enough spin off ec benefits to make it pay? Alternative is to be marginal supplier when oil starts to be replaced by alt energy. /2
4545 2018-04-11 16:39:21 USA must stop wars in name of this fucXXX petrol oil. you destroyed Iraq,Libia,Afghanistan,and now Syria.The partnership with Israel committing violence on civil people.We’re tired of this spilled blood! You can’t decide for all the world,you’re 1 but worth 0.

4552 2018-04-11 16:38:28 There are a lot of moving parts to todays market.  Be aware and watch your exposure levels and sectors.  Oil going up is good for some areas and a clear negative for others.  CBG's are breaking down a little here.  Bond markets will be the big story at some point. @kevinmuir
4553 2018-04-11 16:38:23 No. Selling oil is not just selling oil. It is about sourcing a product that doesn't help to fund terrorism, or gov'ts that oppress human rights, and women's rights. It's about social and environmental responsibility.
Just like support local versus a mega-chain.
4554 2018-04-11 16:38:20 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
4555 2018-04-11 16:38:16 So called "deficit hawks" seem awful happy about a tax cut that will explode the deficit. I hope people see them for the snake oil salesmen that they are.

4566 2018-04-11 16:37:35 Agree. So much left unsaid. Palmer was very disappointing as 'voice of BC' in the facts he left out. His claim that majority of BC'ers support #TMX pipeline is misleading. I wish The Current would interview Derek Corrigan, and a journalist less of a shill for big oil.
4567 2018-04-11 16:37:34 The #Kochs own 1 million acres of Canada's Oil Sands. #cdnpoli
4568 2018-04-11 16:37:12 It’s not about the pipeline at all Mike, it’s about your plans for the oil once it gets to the end, to Westridge Marine Terminal where your plan is to increase the number of oil tankers being loaded and sailing to Asia through our coast by an additional 7 times. Are you nuts?
4569 2018-04-11 16:37:09 Russia is not a superpower you putz.  Russia is not even in the top 10 in economies in the world.  Russia's economy is half the size of CALIFORNIA alone!!! Their GDP dropped 40% when oil prices started to tank because their only "superpower" is that they have a lot of oil.

Then send me invites to TJay's Garage to puchase some hand crafted wooden spoons. Then ignore it. Because i can get spoons for free

4589 2018-04-11 16:35:12 Oh please. I grew up in fort mcmurray and my husband still works there. It's a beautiful place. The oil sands had a very real purpose and propped up this country for decades. It is time to diversify but phasing out oil takes time. However, not under ndp watch.
4590 2018-04-11 16:35:08 NDX makes the least amount of sense with oil exploding...but who knows

4593 2018-04-11 16:35:00 Not in favour of this idea. If oil companies and their investors recognize a risk, what makes anyone think our woefully inexperienced socialist govt in alberta will manage this risk more effectively? If they are cutting bait, that should be sign.

4598 2018-04-11 16:34:32 The Supreme Court could rule that all personal data is property endowing data with constitutional protections and forcing tech companies to seek permission and share profits. Just as oil resources on your land are yours, so is your data, the oil of the 21st century.
4599 2018-04-11 16:34:21 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
4600 2018-04-11 16:34:10 Why? Alberta has the world’s 3rd largest oil reserve, & the globe consumes more oil every single year, with no peak in sight (let alone a decrease). Diversification needs to happen...but global oil consumption won’t decline in your lifetime. If you think it will, post legit link.
4601 2018-04-11 16:34:01 I don't think sustainable palm oil truly exists

4605 2018-04-11 16:33:45 @JamesGRickards Jim not sure if u look at Oil but is higher oil here to stay? In other words, is higher oil already signaling higher inflation or is the current oil price just speculation and is not driven by demand & supply dynamics?
4606 2018-04-11 16:33:44 Hey Chrissie, the replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage the rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

4610 2018-04-11 16:33:39 The US does not need the natural gas or the pipelines for our own people. 81% of our oil supply comes from the Americas & that will be 100% within 5 years. Our only interest in the EU is to help our NATO allies hold on to democracy & help with security from the Russians.

4613 2018-04-11 16:33:23 Keep in mind that the US no longer needs AB oil, so the AB view is that other markets need to be pursued...

4622 2018-04-11 16:32:54 @JustinTrudeau Why don’t we keep and refine and oil here in Canada,  instead of shipping it out to other refinery’s,  wed have cheaper fuel for all Canadians, more jobs.   If the oil belongs to Canadians why are a select few getting very rich of it?!?!?
4623 2018-04-11 16:32:54 Maybe it is all just a ruse to get the oil price up?
4624 2018-04-11 16:32:49 sirius gave us a similar offer. we have a ford. and believe its oil was changed recently. but i dont want sirius, so i just deleted the email.

4627 2018-04-11 16:32:42 Looking behind it looks like nobody beleive that Houthis can disrupt SA oil supply.
4628 2018-04-11 16:32:37 Ryan stayed out of site from the moment Trump became President when it was obvious that Trump was more of a liability than asset. He most likely has a job lined up within the oil industry. Oil companies were a big contributor to his campaigns.
4629 2018-04-11 16:32:37 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
4630 2018-04-11 16:32:25 Oil Change and New brakes on my vehicle are needed 
4631 2018-04-11 16:32:24 Sure. The shale mindset is what needs to change. Goldman Sachs' report yesterday says that tight oil is becoming the marginal barrel b/c of too many players, hopelessly complex acreage, lack of efficiency. Deepwater will be the low-cost producer going forward. Fascinating.
4632 2018-04-11 16:32:21 무ㅜ야 주세요 안 먹을 수도 있자나요
4633 2018-04-11 16:32:19 Oil isn’t the issue but the cost of extraction and refining in a market glutted with the stuff.
4634 2018-04-11 16:32:18 We are also pretty good at pretending we know how to check the oil in your car.
4635 2018-04-11 16:32:17 A massive problem for them is that some didn't see through the 2014 party political broadca---- sorry..White Paper.

But that was so founded on the high price of oil that when it crashed , so soon after the vote..I think it was quite a big change moment for how SNP docs are seen
4636 2018-04-11 16:32:15 This is big 

Saudi #Aramco, world's biggest oil producer, announces $44 billion deal to build giant refinery complex on west coast of India. reports AFP
4637 2018-04-11 16:32:13 So why not jam it with more tankers?! Like the ones 4x in size using the LOOP terminal? That’s your logic? I used to live with a view of English Bay & have seen barges tip over. I have worked in O&G on oil sands and international ventures. I have worked for the BC govt. #nokm

4640 2018-04-11 16:32:08 (2) I work in the oil patch. A lot of what I've done for almost 40 years is pull data for folks who do reporting to the AER and feds around GHG and emergency response planning. Alberta's regulations are among the toughest in the world. You WANT us producing more.

4643 2018-04-11 16:31:57 That is a good idea. I put roasted chick peas, garlic, paprika, and olive oil over it, but it wasn't enough.
4644 2018-04-11 16:31:53 A little girl said to her mum after a Falklands News Bulletin at the time..  “Why can’t we have one island and they have the other” Wars are always about more than Govt’s sell the wars on. Iraq was oil & payback. This ones oil, cover and burying scandals. No chemicals. NOT FOR US
4645 2018-04-11 16:31:45 Thank the lord that Westminster are there to help us yet again with this valueless burden of oil, we'd be destitute without their help.

4647 2018-04-11 16:31:30 Could’ve just let me stay home. Could’ve bought me an Uber or lyft. They had to send my poor baby to pick me up it’s a leaking oil and low on gas. I hate everyone

4654 2018-04-11 16:30:58 Selling oil is selling oil. You are more than welcome to do that.  But don't mischaracterize or trivialize what are real environmental risks with ones that are not to make your point.
4655 2018-04-11 16:30:53 Maybe Trump meant Syria we love you.they just omit Syria we love you for your oil, gas.did you see how they use children? Yet they don't care about the children of Yemen, Palestine, Iraq.

4660 2018-04-11 16:30:48 Oil goal production was up, if you exclude PP fiasco.  Sure there was less depth scoring. Part of rationale of signing 97/29 for huge $ is accepting less depth scoring. GAA was much worse, partly due to PK/Cam.  Model works if PP/PK/Cam improve.
4661 2018-04-11 16:30:45 Does Yemen or Siria have any oil? Do you get it now?
4662 2018-04-11 16:30:44 The comparison of social media to American auto companies made me lol. It was like he had to wrack his brain for business models and could only come up with Automobiles or Oil.

4675 2018-04-11 16:29:20 Is #SaudiArabia is trapped on oil policy? The back of the oil curve is pricing in #oil in the low 50's WTI and low 60's Brent. They're depleting forex reserves now and the market no longer views their production cuts as material in the long-run. Aramco is a one-off.
4676 2018-04-11 16:29:12 To have a responsible product. We ensure our country sells something while committed to protecting water, use carbon capture, use equal workforces. This is what Canadian Oil is. And BC only listens to the part they don't like. (3)
4677 2018-04-11 16:29:07 You got to qualify? We got bupkis after our ammo budget was cut to "essential personnel only." All my practice was with borrowed 1903s and M-1 carbines at nearby civilian ranges. Handgun practice was with a borrowed S&W Model 10, sometimes a 39.

Doubt the Oil were in same position, waiting for full season to reflect
4693 2018-04-11 16:27:37 On oil from nations like Saudi, Venezuela, etc., where human rights aren't a priority. Environmental protection is not a priority.

4718 2018-04-11 16:25:49 Because it seems BC doesn't want to talk about the realistic implications. Canadian Oil is a product that helps promote social programs, equality, education, and more. When we can sell that product to a foreign nation, and have our own citizens use it, we remove dependence (1)

4721 2018-04-11 16:25:28 Why don't you two live near oil storage tanks on south side of Burnaby Mountain? Incomparable amounts of volatile chemicals will be stored in those 26 oil storage tanks, 14 of them will be added if Transmountain expansion happens
4722 2018-04-11 16:25:28 Roads, hospitals, sewage... oh, I guess you didn't realize governments paid for those. And the oil industry still gets subsidies from governments, but the real subsidy is the fact that 95% of the clean-up will be left to Canadian taxpayers for generations.
4723 2018-04-11 16:25:27 Since I married my husband 19 years ago, I've taught him to change oil, brakes, use power tools, etc. We just finished redoing our basement and tackles retiling the shower this week.

4750 2018-04-11 16:23:25 In terms of logic, having 26 oil storage tanks on south side of Burnaby Mountain between 10000s residents and up to 30000 people at SFU is extremely flawed

4752 2018-04-11 16:23:21 Why is Assad government not legal? Whom the holy goat to decide for the Syrian people what should they have to lead them? If Assad is not legal, how can the other oil sheikhs in the ME be anything legal? Talking about the disgusting, blatant hypocrisy of the rapacious Empire.

4760 2018-04-11 16:22:41 OKAY SO: the best key against oily skin is a good moisturizer. your skin produces a lot of sebum because your skin is actually dry beneath it all, so I personally recommend soothing aloe vera gel during day time and an oil during night time. but ofc you can use somethng else for

4767 2018-04-11 16:22:12 rose oil is an anti-depressant and has numerous other benefits; not sure if they are obtained from eating though, I love the flavour though.  One of your competitors has a rose flavoured raw chocolate.  It's not fair to name them here.  Rose infused vodka is great too.
4768 2018-04-11 16:22:01 Exactly. Who looks at last year's EBITDA, especially now that oil price is much higher?

4791 2018-04-11 16:20:16 My poll shows the TrumpTrain opposes an attack on Syria by 88%. Since when do leaders care what the people that elected them think? There are no oil reserves under a voting booth. There are tremendous oil reserves under #Syria.

4794 2018-04-11 16:19:48 Can you explain your comment about KM "drilling." Do you mean drilling for oil and gas?
4795 2018-04-11 16:19:40 #ukog #Horsehill in 2016 sent 2000 barrels of oil to Fawley after just a few hours of flow testing. 2018 150 day testing will send a shed load more than that soon ;)

4819 2018-04-11 16:17:25 Apparently you have no problem with oil tankers bringing oil from other countries to the Port of Vancouver. For 60 years oil has been transported through Burrard Inlet without incident but just in case you want to choke off your partner in Confederation. Sounds reasonable.

4827 2018-04-11 16:16:31 Because I’m acne prone I always forget that hydration is KEY. As soon as I do a milk cleanser or a moisture mask my skin drinks it all up moisture is attracted to moisture so if you’re oily hydration essentially balances your oil levels #skinwithmarie

4829 2018-04-11 16:16:29 @narendramodi speaks as if he is a leader of opposition. He can reduce the oil price in one order
4830 2018-04-11 16:16:19 IF it's proven by the a neutral INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION that the Chemical attack was NOT by Syria's government but ISIS type rebels or others,
THEN @POTUS is obligated to BACK OFF.

Develop "SHALE to OIL" at home, get out of the Middle East oil market...
4831 2018-04-11 16:16:15 Further upside, Alberta's newfound fishing industry will soon negate the need for reliance on the oil industry, which will have rendered this change totally unnecessary to begin with, but they'll start asking for more Ocean environmental protections.

4834 2018-04-11 16:15:52 Storage is added all the time so that is a factor but CI is determined relative to the 5-yr avg. The 5-yr avg has increased b/c of all the oil put into storage 2015-2017 so that's a factor to consider. Still, I don't think any of this affects the reliability of CI.

4875 2018-04-11 16:11:55 During the 70's we were broke, but addicted to oil. We didn't have enough cheap #gold for cheap oil anymore (Nixon) so we sold out our land and soul. Now we have no land, no soul and no ... gold. But alot of debt.

Seems like a hasty decision.
4889 2018-04-11 16:10:47 Not entirely. The assumption in AB is that less dependence on the US oil market will improve the price AB receives for its oil, thus improve royalty revenues.

Once Europeans thought they were protecting themselves from the Jews. Also did the things to natives of the Americas, Australia. Today, the same are focusing on Muslims for oil, you know.

4910 2018-04-11 16:09:06 Also, if it's unsustainable what makes other oils more sustainable? They have to replace it with something. Often these oils will come from crops with lower yields that will therefore need more land to produce the same amount of oil
4911 2018-04-11 16:09:06 I have doubts about this whole thing. IMHO this could be all set up by Putin to raise the price of oil and make Trump look strong. The rising price of oil during a conflict is predictable and IMHO we are possibly  being played. Putin get's substantial gains from this conflict.

4920 2018-04-11 16:08:22 You murder black people. You bomb countries in the name of 'freedom' and 'democracy' (meaning oil and resources, respectively). You destabilise regions to the point where slave markets thrive. All of this - and you still have the gall to claim that you are saviours.
4921 2018-04-11 16:08:13 It's the oil Westminster is hell-bent on KEEPING.
4922 2018-04-11 16:08:05 We don’t have gas out here in the sticks. Only oil. But we make do. Thanks for your concern. We’ll be fine. Both as a family and a county.
4923 2018-04-11 16:08:04 The 52 is a dynamic sole grind. Both in oil can and can not be replaced
4924 2018-04-11 16:07:58 It's why I hope @IcelandFoods has found a proper sustainable source for their food oils before switching away from palm oil. Certified palm oil offers the avoidance of animal cruelty whereas there's no way to get the cow to produce milk or to produce lard without direct harm
4925 2018-04-11 16:07:50 I don't think it's wholly inconceivable to attribute political leadership for rise in NPA's. It's the economic policies and also a huge chunk of how world economy was performing.the period of 2008-2011/2012 was the period of recession, high oil rates for which UPA had paid price.
4926 2018-04-11 16:07:49 Lower gas prices? Maybe the #dentonrc should look at the oil market before throwing that in

4937 2018-04-11 16:06:45 Oil prices are well up today after sabre-rattling between Russia and the U.S over Syria. "Missiles will be coming" from @realDonaldTrump driving oil up. Ease in U.S-China tariff policy also helps direction. If refined prices drop this week, they'll be up in next week's setting.

4952 2018-04-11 16:05:15 This is about field testing for arms sales, driving up the price of oil and  stirring up nationalistic fervors.
4953 2018-04-11 16:05:08 yes. No one is saying we should stop that. Just face reality. Oil will continue to be part of life throughout the world for decades to come. Canada could b a voice 4 human/women's rights & environmental standards if it spoke from a position of strength #cdnpoli

4955 2018-04-11 16:05:02 Palm oil production is as unsustainable in Africa as in Asia. The difference is that since 90% of global palm oil comes from Asia, deforestation is more striking. Iceland misleads that a choice to say "no" is being given to customers for 1st time. Choice means providing options.

5009 2018-04-11 16:00:12 He has deregulated us and taken us back 70yrs - we want clean water, air, oil spill regulations, regulations to keep elderly safe in convalesant homes We want Climate change help - we want respect for the country back - that won't happen until he's gone

5014 2018-04-11 15:59:41 #Russia-n misile strike should be directed at US ,UK and French allied rich gulf regimes .. it will lead to shut down of oil export from the region will send price of oil to three digits .
5015 2018-04-11 15:59:38 Switching to healthier oils such as avocado and olive oil and reducing your sugar and processed food intake. To be honest, if cooked right you can even eat French fries to your hearts delight
5016 2018-04-11 15:59:34 Simple fact is the releases that have happened or could happen at #Fukushima are not likely a concern for #BC. But an oil spill would be. So to answer your question #BritishColumbians are right in their concerns about tanker traffic and oils spills from an impact point of view

5019 2018-04-11 15:59:23 Kalau nak buat double cleansing, pakai gel cleanser + normal cleanser boleh ke? Sebab i baca DC guna oil, milk and balm cleanser
5020 2018-04-11 15:59:21 Oil moving notably higher this week. Pushing to $67 today. I believe we haven’t seen that price since Dec 2014.
5021 2018-04-11 15:59:20 One of my biggest gripe about Nigeria for years now.

Hard to see how we can adequately provide for this exploding population  given dwindling income from oil and gas and not much else being done to develop other sectors.

Our amenities are already creaking under current weight
5022 2018-04-11 15:59:18 I really wish people could learn how to palletize an engine for proper transport. A 500lb engine isn't going to be supported by just a couple of slats on a pallet. If you're not going to crate it then the oil pan needs to sit squarely on the center strut of the pallet.
5023 2018-04-11 15:59:17 how does this differ from Norway's control of its oil production?
5024 2018-04-11 15:59:16 it’s a recipe I came up with! olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, asparagus, s+p, Parmesan cheese and a short grain pasta (something you’d use in a soup)
5025 2018-04-11 15:59:15 Yes thats why i gave up mines. $100 for a oil change smh nahh i got rid of that

5027 2018-04-11 15:59:10 Will this include israel with the masacre of gaza civilians during easter? I doubt it this has nothing to do with syria but the oil in golan heights, which is in syria. Stop being a tool.

5029 2018-04-11 15:59:08 After my cycle commute I like to refuel by drinking a litre of refined crude oil made of 650 million year old fossils. Not really I just eat a banana  #cycling
5030 2018-04-11 15:59:08 Jimboman - any chance I can access to the posts on your notebook? Been patiently waiting for 3 days for them to unlock but this is worse than a 5 year old waiting for Christmas!!!  lol. Oil is acting plain crazy, reports bearish but price up. Patiently waiting for the fall

5032 2018-04-11 15:59:05 The Olive oil is optional, a trickle of honey is good or just have it without but no rum that's for drinking and having fun after the meal. More love LR
5033 2018-04-11 15:58:55 That the (base)capacity of u.s. inventories is higher now that more oil is produced in the u.s. Higher production would require more storage capacity because there is more to store. Does this make sense?
5034 2018-04-11 15:58:50 Maybe make an effort to stop using palm oil and unnecessary plastic packaging in your products. Be the first, show the other supermarkets it is possible
5035 2018-04-11 15:58:44 72, but only officers get carts and handicaps
5036 2018-04-11 15:58:43 That statement was way too Powerful for Congress To Understand in its entirety... all they Seen was "Oil Reserves"...

5044 2018-04-11 15:58:03  you can add a super thin layer of olive oil on top to help keep the moisture out.
5045 2018-04-11 15:58:01 $CHK , I am assuming with the #oil breakout , this heavy shorted little guy can turn to a monster in a blink of an eye .
5046 2018-04-11 15:58:01 Again, which wars? And what was the rationale given for them? I am reflexively against US military intervention, but I acknowledge complexity. Even the Cold Warriors truly believed fighting Communism was the right thing to do. We HAVE gone to war for oil: it's not a given.

5050 2018-04-11 15:57:39 Well boys and girls. Looks like oil might hit $70 a barrel. Bring on the boom! #showmethemoney
5051 2018-04-11 15:57:37 Really let’s get real you wouldn’t even notice additional tanker traffic ! How would it affect your life? there is 600,000 bbls of oil coming from Alaska everyday right through your back yard.Should we quit farming to stop shipments of wheat disturbing your swim?
5052 2018-04-11 15:57:36 Making small changes like @pipandnut no palm oil peanut butter..( it tastes better too )....makes all the difference if we all try  #PalmOilAlarmCall

5054 2018-04-11 15:57:14 I'm in the same boat. I'm not sure how 3 litre water + 3 cups oil + 2kg onions, will come out to only create 3 litres of base mixture, and cooked with the lid on as well. Any insight would be helpful!

It would be interesting to see just how much money the GOP received in total, from NRA, drug companies, oil companies & minning.

5064 2018-04-11 15:56:30 Exactly what pain has BC inflicted on Alberta?  Alberta's economy is booming.  Oil & gas are a tiny fraction of Alberta's econony. I'm sure you know that.
5065 2018-04-11 15:56:27 there’s a reason the ancient Greeks loved olive oil so much… @313doe @trotskyplug @KpDat
5066 2018-04-11 15:56:17 Bill Nye has to be the least qualified person in Canada to draw any conclusions about our oil & gas industries. He’s like the Mr. Dress-up of scientists, a leftist shill.
5067 2018-04-11 15:56:15 There's no proof that Assad did it. I am no fan of Assad, but sick of US, Saudi and Israel manipulating the situation to get their hands on oil. Assad was winning the fight and rebels were on the run, so the rebels killed their own. #GenieEnergy

5076 2018-04-11 15:55:39 Doesn’t make lots of sense (the price correlation part) taking that the trend for oil prices will be down until oil becomes a thing of the past some decades from now while btc price will go up until fiat becomes a thing of the past. #bitcoin

Other than just about all members of Congress.. especially you @SpeakerRyan???
5082 2018-04-11 15:54:57 Yes, we've been through that propaganda before.  The problem is the oil sands are more expensive to produce from and fetch a lower price due to US stranglehold.

5090 2018-04-11 15:54:31 So, are you finally comparing apples to apples here? Or do you need to keep arguing with me?

The point is both forms of energy are necessary, and yet it seems only Canadian Oil is protested. An "educated" man seems to be more concerned with a hypothetical oil spill, then reality
5091 2018-04-11 15:54:21 It's def "unrealistic" from the oil industry's perspective, but if the goverment made upgrades a condition for the pipe, they'd come around.

5094 2018-04-11 15:54:16 Bit late to the game but @IcelandFoods removing palm oil from own products.....amazing!! I mean totally amazing. Here's hoping other big companies follow suit. Not just supermarkets but food manufacturers too. If you don't get why its a big deal, just google it.
5095 2018-04-11 15:54:16 I was at game...have to assume Suter was on pitch count reason he was pulled. Drake really started the oil leak when he came in.

5101 2018-04-11 15:53:44 According to Richard Walker, they're switching to sunflower and rapeseed plus butter and lard. Never mind that the biggest grower of sunflower oil France is facing biodiversity oblivion. The concern here is intense animal cruelty from butter and lard.
5102 2018-04-11 15:53:36 Canada has intelligent people that can build solar powered vehicles using batteries that can be recycled over and over again.  That can be used in our harsh environment.  We don't need oil & gas anymore but they want people to depend on the gov't for everything.  This is how the

5121 2018-04-11 15:51:59 Iceland are removing palm oil from their products, but it is almost impossible to buy things without it and all this since we were informed of the destructive nature of its production! Why does all this sound familiar?

5123 2018-04-11 15:51:50 On Syria: If there were a serious effort from this administration to stop Assad, strict financial sanctions should be placed on him AND Putin. Shut their access to their finances worldwide. Anything outside of Syria/Russia should be seized. Ban their oil worldwide @AliVelshi
5124 2018-04-11 15:51:49 Oil from a spill in BC would not devastate the Japanese coast, like a radioactive waste release would not decimate the BC coast. Right? But the immediate area of the spill area would have severe impacts, can we agree on that?

5138 2018-04-11 15:50:26 #KeystonePipeline.."original Keystone pipeline has spilled 407,000 gallons in South Dakota. It’s twice as big as what TransCanada originally told regulators, and it’s now the seventh largest onshore oil spill since 2010."-ClimateHawks
5139 2018-04-11 15:50:22 But the oil spill would have a devastating impact.

800,000 tons of radioactive waste, accidentally released, in one area, would do nothing? Bullshit. It would decimate the immediate area of the spill. Like oil. Before it was diluted. This is an apples to apples situation.
5140 2018-04-11 15:50:03 Looks like KM decided to bail out because TMX no longer makes sense (see global oil markets developments of past 2-3 years) & if TMX makes no sense for KM it makes even less sense 2 nationalize it. God knows we can spend our tax money on other things. Worst possible outcome.
5141 2018-04-11 15:50:03 But you're the animal killing the wildlife by approving more oil drilling in the Artic wildlife refuge. Threatening species and your PEOPLE.
5142 2018-04-11 15:49:53 Directional opinions aside, the fact that geopolitics matters to oil again is tell in and of itself.
5143 2018-04-11 15:49:53 @realDonaldTrump @VladimirPutin_R THIS IS ALL ABOUT OIL ISN'T IT? EVERYONE SHOULD LEAVE. LET THE SYRIAN PEOPLE HEAL. assad SHOULD STEP DOWN.

5147 2018-04-11 15:49:35 Like the oil industry, or coal.
5148 2018-04-11 15:49:23 The report I did on Iran being attacked by Israel in 1973 bombings was to expand Israel land ownership in the middle east 70 years ago UN/USA gave Israel Palestinian land knowing Muslim/torah would lead to war opening middle east to US/UK oil/gas interests by overthrowing Syria

5162 2018-04-11 15:48:47 @JoeFortenbaugh how bout massaging @LorenzoNeal feet with hot oil on fb live? 
5163 2018-04-11 15:48:45 Ok. Let's try to make you understand. Both an oil spill in BC & a release of radioactive waste in Fukushima are hypothetical. The likelihood of either happening is realistically low. 
You claim that the Fukushima incident would have no environmental impact because of dilution.
5164 2018-04-11 15:48:43 I share your view, but think that will come to be seen over time.  If we are talking Syria, it makes sense to reach for gold, oil, bonds.

5166 2018-04-11 15:48:28 Pro tip: the fries at the Gazebo are the best on Wednesday evenings and Thursday afternoons. They exchange the old oil on Wednesday afternoons, and the fries are borderline gorgeous
5167 2018-04-11 15:48:23 Look what has happened to the price of oil since the chem attack. Was this chem attack a plan by Putin to raise the price of oil???

Should see continued strength of oil stocks tomorrow 
5169 2018-04-11 15:48:15 Agreed. They'll have no choice if they want to reduce the deficit.

Unless of course the hidden oil fields actually exist.
5170 2018-04-11 15:48:12 @Bill_Morneau Time to think out of the boat - Canada needs value from oil, not to just be a conduit, like an exploited third world country. Refine, process, use. Time to think big.

5173 2018-04-11 15:47:49 1. Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good.
5174 2018-04-11 15:47:44 No kidding. And he’ll make a ton more lobbying for guns, oil and anything else destructive.
5175 2018-04-11 15:47:37 Not sure we see announcements on any of this today, but I'm gonna say #Oilers don't renew contracts of any of the 3 AC's, nor that of AHL HC Gerry Flemming, amd we see some changes in the pro scouting department; could see Ian Herbers landing on his feet as Oil Kings HC.

5177 2018-04-11 15:47:33 The only reason that makes sense why Russia would allow a gas attack and invite missiles is to raise fears of wider conflict thereby raising oil prices... buy the VIX #FireWhenReady #WW3 #MAGA
5178 2018-04-11 15:47:29 Data is the new oil, not bitcoin.
5179 2018-04-11 15:47:01 Even if you don’t believe there’s a national security threat, it does not mean the USA isn’t going in there for other reasons unrelated to Israel, eg oil, “spreading democracy”, etc
5180 2018-04-11 15:47:00 Before the tar sands BC was the refining hub to Western Canada. When the oil companies moved the refineries to be close to the tar sands the output dropped. AB doesn't provide BC with enough fuel or crude to service Metro Van so what would a new BC refinery use?
5181 2018-04-11 15:46:56 I had forgotten the actual smell. My last batch went hard so I softened it with the only mineral oil we had... which was baby oil. Needless to say, once baked the smell was bloody atrocious.
5182 2018-04-11 15:46:54 This is exactly why Putin is messing around in Syria. He doesn't want war with the US, just the threat of it. Putin desperately needs oil prices to rise to save Russia from bankruptcy.
5183 2018-04-11 15:46:50 There are said to be vast oil reserves around the Golan Heigjts, as already disclosed gas fields off Lebanon

5210 2018-04-11 15:44:43 with the exception of long oil pretty much every favorite trade out there right now is negative carry  - short USD, long gold, short bonds etc.
5211 2018-04-11 15:44:43 I went for an oil change. $27 & then it would be $33 total for the disposal fee & tax. So I went to this other place for $19.95 but it took me 20 more mins to get there & now I have to wait 1.5 hrs so I'm getting food  would have saved money staying @ the 1st place lol
5212 2018-04-11 15:44:41 @JazyCarlson Oh, wow! Hope you had a great trip. If you ever happen to need an oil change back in CO, we're here for you!
5213 2018-04-11 15:44:35 Actually, I didn't suggest that at all. Stop making assumptions. I've compared the accidental release of the nuclear waste at Fukushima (800,000+ tons), to an oil spill on the BC coast. Both are hypothetical situations. 
You've evidently not been paying attention.
5214 2018-04-11 15:44:29 Wow.  So not only do you not understand what a right is, you have no idea how insurance works.  Do youfile a claim against your auto policy every time you get the oil changed?

5216 2018-04-11 15:44:21 IMHO, this extreme bullishness in precious #metals and #oil is entirely due to fear of the conflict in Syria. Both are at major resistance and I expect the hammer to drop soon on both.

5224 2018-04-11 15:43:39 Oil is at $70/bbl roughly half it was when it was in the $1.30s last time in 2007-2008? Lame excuses from oil companies on 'summer' fuel

5249 2018-04-11 15:41:56 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
5250 2018-04-11 15:41:56 Not really.  DAPL much safer than transporting oil via train. If u can find a way to make steel for infrastructure on solar power w/o carbon, please tell researchers how!  Environment will be just fine

5253 2018-04-11 15:41:44 This is a problem. Iran needs to address. One way is to work with China and Russia to create a tripartite trade system which uses CNY or RUB (ie export oil in CNY vs buying goods in CNY, neutralising FX effect) away from USD-based systems.

5279 2018-04-11 15:40:20 It’s a TERRIBLE human rights abuse to keep rationalizing invasions with false flags and interventionalism.

We are STEALING from these people by making them buy our fiat to trade oil, and trashing their region if they don’t want to debt-finance our greed & entitlement
5280 2018-04-11 15:40:20 Price action in $SPY certainly exhibits seller exhaustion.. and seems like the recovery in AMZN and FB is going to lead tech and the broader indices higher in the near term.. energy sector  also has a lot of room to catch up to oil prices

5300 2018-04-11 15:38:58 I completely agree. Getting working folks to listen to your 1st world problems while you exorcise your white privilege from your narcissistic pedestal is a not an easy gig.

5303 2018-04-11 15:38:43 it also probably needs an oil change if you haven’t done that yet.
5304 2018-04-11 15:38:43 If you really wanna spray it with Lysol for piece of mind you can, just make sure you clean it and oil it after. 
That’d probably be my move here if I had concerns or fears about it.
5305 2018-04-11 15:38:42 Dude. ETNs and ETFs aren't good. If I had started with futures when I first met Jimboman instead of playing ETFs, I would have had a lot more money. Consider futures. In just 2 fractal cycles, you can take away a good amount of money from a fund manager who doesn't need it.

5341 2018-04-11 15:36:07 Perhaps you're right. The UN also says Indigenous rights are trampled on in this country. So lets get oil to tide water and respect Indigenous peoples. Let's do it all.

5352 2018-04-11 15:35:02 Thank #Hillary, it was her project.

Real starter was the US invasion of Iraq in '03; = Halliburton Corp's initiative. Iraq's oil infrastructure was too ruined to fix, we couldn't steal the oil and the invasion impulse petered out.

The war in Syria is about an oil pipeline for Iraq's stolen resources.
5367 2018-04-11 15:33:58 When they say "sorry we were wrong" I'll believe you. The oil industry can do no wrong I suppose. Like the cigarette industry. Everything is fine, nothing to see here.

5406 2018-04-11 15:30:52 @AFPMonline Since the Left hates anything remotely related to oil, petroleum products etc, bc of the environment, I think it would be perfect if they no longer receive ANY product that came from your source. They are such hypocrites

5410 2018-04-11 15:30:46 It's always about oil. Assad was winning the fight and the foreign backed rebels were on the run, and when Trump announced 'US was thinking of pulling out of Syria" they panicked and went for Plan Z. This is Saudi and Israel seeking ME domination, what next?

5433 2018-04-11 15:29:06 Ideology can’t trump evidence. Independent forecasts show world GDP and demand oil growing for next 20+ years. Issue is whose oil and what environmental standards for production and use. Canada a world leader. Shifting production elsewhere = higher emissions, not lower.

5453 2018-04-11 15:27:33 We are already a net exporter of oil. They don’t care, this war was planned long ago. 

And we are never leaving the ME, not during our lifetime. 

A substantial # of the people working on the coup, just wanted this war.
5454 2018-04-11 15:27:31 Use coconut oil
5455 2018-04-11 15:27:27 This has nothing to do with the impact of high oil prices in India, or the handshake of Macron and Aramco’s worth $10 billion, or with insider trading carried on by those on the know. Of course not.
5456 2018-04-11 15:27:27 $TGC Added .74 for a major oil run. This thing loves to run hard! $CEI $GBR
5457 2018-04-11 15:27:27 Don't forget to look at USD depreciation, which pushes oil price higher
5458 2018-04-11 15:27:26 That's true. Lots of sectors all in the mix. Oil is no more important than the others which is exactly my point.
5459 2018-04-11 15:27:26 #wti #oil  New tactic.  Yemen sends missiles just as EIA report is issued.  Guess they believe they can influence the release.  Released was bearish and as everyone jumped into long positions, it may not hold.

5484 2018-04-11 15:25:37 For real. It's honestly shocking to me that people still fall for MLMs these days. 

Also, when I had a wisdom tooth grow INTO another tooth, someone told me to 'just rub clove oil on it. that oral surgery is totally unnecessary.' 
5485 2018-04-11 15:25:28 Think everyone is buying up Oil because of fear of war but no real war yet. This is an inverse ETF so think Oil will come back down

5487 2018-04-11 15:25:26 Your MCM is trying to blackmail oil bloc owners into supporting his reelection bid.
5488 2018-04-11 15:25:25 B.C. has 2 live w consequences of voting in NDP. Horgan today said Alberta's threat 2 cut off oil to B.C. is provocative. What a joke. B.C. DOES NOT WANT ALBERTA OIL, (or pipelines, so that Alberta's oil industry survives). What's provocative about getting exactly what they want?
5489 2018-04-11 15:25:20 These prices will solve that problem. US production works with a 3m lag. It has barely responded to $55 oil. There is a lot of convexity in supply after that. We are going from just Permian to all basins in play right now.

5525 2018-04-11 15:23:08 How many KM jobs vs most of BC’s tourism jobs to send out oil for someone else to profit from...
5526 2018-04-11 15:22:48 Seriously? Why don’t you speak to your colleagues in Edmonton and Calgary. Talk to companies trying to sell their oil but can’t because of limits to pipeline capacity. Ask marketers about the discount on heavy crude because we are hostage to US refineries.
5527 2018-04-11 15:22:43 The second bullet should actually be the first one. Far less demand on oil will improve our prices, and that's a bottom line consumers love.
5528 2018-04-11 15:22:42 I like it. Will the oil companies also be doing a little extra for their piece?

5540 2018-04-11 15:21:33 Great! Every oil sands construction site I've been on atleast had 3000 workers. I'm sure if there was a rally around those areas  - no one would hesitate showing up!

5544 2018-04-11 15:21:15 It will be foolish on the part of the Shiv Sena to oppose the proposed Rs 3 lakh-crore oil refinery n petrochemicals complex at Ratnagiri. After a long gap Maharashtra is getting a mega project. Of course, locals should get preference in matters of job.

5546 2018-04-11 15:21:10 Ungrateful for what? Reminder who was benefactor before the Oil boom? Look back to history. You just paying back. Doesn’t mean you can freelance. NOT FOR SALE.
5547 2018-04-11 15:21:08 Bob, it appears your argument has become circular.

Regardless, The FMV of the GPT would be rationally determined by the amount Oil is willing to pay in similar situations.

I understand you disagree, and I accept the same.

Good day.
5548 2018-04-11 15:21:07 The US, UK and NATO they will not get the oil from Syria. The first oil to be defend in centuries against US.
5549 2018-04-11 15:21:06 #oott US crude oil imports are up 12% from the same week last year. The growing imbalance of overproducing light distillates and shrinking WTI crude oil production shows its impact.

5565 2018-04-11 15:19:43 did Forties oil pipeline closure have impact on this?
5566 2018-04-11 15:19:42 @WildeSubaru1 after a 2008 subaru repair, my engine threw a rod 6 days, 400 miles, later b/c it had no oil. It had 4 qts when I brought it in. They offered $500 "discount" off a $27k used car as a remedy. I'm underwhelmed. #fail #carrepair #poorcustomerservice
5567 2018-04-11 15:19:39 Yes, the Line 9 project would allow oil to be delivered to a terminus where an additional pipeline could then take it to Portland, ME.
5568 2018-04-11 15:19:33 Syria is in the way of the last leg of a massive oil pipeline connection that would have controlled every drop of oil in the region. Cabal member Hillary Clinton was, of course, in on it.
5569 2018-04-11 15:19:30 How much oil do we export? How much oil do we burn in order to to import oil?
5570 2018-04-11 15:19:23 Yea, the same ISiS group that the saudis and gulf countries are funding right? The same Isis group that was allowed to sell oil on the black market uninterrupted while we turn a blind eye ? Your the one with the bs post

5573 2018-04-11 15:19:19 That doesn't include me although like everyone I'm far from perfect in other areas! But I know what you mean, do as I say not as I do.... So, it is vital we change mindset & approach on palm oil, plastic, consumption per se & much much more!
5574 2018-04-11 15:19:18 It’s hard to imagine now, but I was FLOORED when the Oil were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention in 2002.

5598 2018-04-11 15:17:57 How can someone as corrupt as Paul Ryan go, freely, just like that? He was supposed to serve the People, not the corporations he took bribes from. Something is seriously wrong with America's idea of "democracy".

5608 2018-04-11 15:17:19 All these wars do is dwindle our finances and capability to protect us an ours... al@we r doing is clearing a path for an damn oil line thru those countries so OPEC can control us more

5650 2018-04-11 15:14:18 The only way to get America out of the Middle East is to open up domestic oil drilling. It may not be great for the environment, but it's a whole lot better for nature than World War III, since cougars cannot really thrive by eating radioactive bodies.
5651 2018-04-11 15:14:18 When oil dropped below 70, in 2015, what did the charts say?
MASSIVELY Oversold.
Tech trading is awesome, but it has to factor in fundamental factors driving the mkt.
Tech analysis does not create price, especially in a dynamic commodity like crude.

5665 2018-04-11 15:13:02 How are fundamentals getting worse?    Oil demand grew by around 1.6 million barrels per day in 2017 and is estimated to grow by a similar amount in 2018 and reach almost 100 million barrels per day

5673 2018-04-11 15:12:37 Facts show that oil giant Shell already knew in 1986 that "some parts of earth will become uninhabitable due to climate warming". Nonetheless, the company then gave tens of millions to lobbyists and climate deniers, and still does so. It spent millions  to influence policy people

5675 2018-04-11 15:12:23 USD Index is in a downtrend too.  Speaks very good for oil.  Inflation is on the rise (obviously)
5676 2018-04-11 15:12:21 The point of this is that if we let this pipeline get built to the Inlet it will be used to increase oil tanker shipments significantly and that is not going to happen. We won’t allow that! That puts our city, our families and our community at risk! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StoppedKM

5681 2018-04-11 15:11:48 We will have to disagree.

In many cases US is asked to intervene because we have power to stop atrocities. In some cases we do it for freedom/justice/etc...many times that is just about power or oil. I won't defend false pretenses.

USA is imperfect, but does more good than harm

5707 2018-04-11 15:09:44 Tech giants have an #oligopoly fined tune like a #monopoly; they are the Standard Oil of our time, but the 'me culpa' of #Zuckerberg in Congress is strange considering the soft ball questions. Weird that an #ArtificialIntelligence company did not know the scope of their doings.
5708 2018-04-11 15:09:34 Ah... now it isn’t. But when there’s oil like in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, then of course it was your problem.
5709 2018-04-11 15:09:33 No one’s looking at history!Israel bombed Iran in the 70s for oil/land expansion.Syria democratically elected country attacked by US backed Isys rebels for oil/gas. Yemen attacked by Saudi Arabia for the port to allow oil/gas to be shipped to U.K US This is about oil/gas pipeline

5805 2018-04-11 15:01:52 CNBC says blasts heard in Riyadh  (Saudi) which has caused Oil to spike.

5810 2018-04-11 15:01:23 I'm thinking some oil trading careers in Houston were set back a bit today #OOTT    The great thing about risk managers is that they can keep you employed despite your own best trading efforts.
5811 2018-04-11 15:01:21 Yeah, it's obvious the foreign actors controlling our oil & pipeline issues are American.
5812 2018-04-11 15:01:17 How about you quit gutting or land for big oil and corporate profits.. How about that day at the office.. When is that day?

5817 2018-04-11 15:00:57 But we're not shifting, demand for petroleum and petroleum products is increasing and will continue to do so

The USA is eating our lunch now, recently becoming a net exporter of oil and continuing to buy our oil at a steep discount because we can't get our product to tidewater
5818 2018-04-11 15:00:52 Professor: Should persons be able to bring a wrongful birth claim?

5821 2018-04-11 15:00:46 Both gold and oil at 2018 would be closing highs right now
5822 2018-04-11 15:00:43 What will happen if the demand for fuel ends and electric cars increase? Nothing, just the era of oil will end, which is impossible for today.
5823 2018-04-11 15:00:42 Children and their parents didn't come up with the vigorish. It's expensive for Liberals like Trudeau to maintain their lifestyle. It takes real moolah, hard cash - you know - OIL MONEY

Mr President is urgent the oil belonging to Scotland Protectorate of Rep of Biafra is returned to the Biafran people. Not to be used for terrorists activities by the English Protectorate Muslim Northern Nigeria. Biafra announcement will kill boko Haram now

5831 2018-04-11 15:00:20 Me too. Feel an idiot, should have checked oil more often, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.
5832 2018-04-11 15:00:18 Heavens no.   Just that all this talk about $100 oil in my stream is slightly absurd
5833 2018-04-11 15:00:18 So are oil companies 
5834 2018-04-11 15:00:17 Went to the Dr this afternoon to get standard blood test results. Everything fine. 

Dr says: Your cholesterol is low. You should take some flaxseed oil.

My brain: Mate, we going to KFC, fuck yeah...
5835 2018-04-11 15:00:15 A pointless question as any logical person reading this should know. There are many ways to fuel an economy, we have global oil and gas interests, we sell tech to the world we are still going to be the financial laundromat of the world.

5843 2018-04-11 14:59:54 Saudi Arabia did say they wanted $80 oil prices, but i don't think they intended to see that by having to intercept ballistic missiles over their capital city.... Brent now at $72.50, up $5.50 for the week and its only Wednesday

5848 2018-04-11 14:59:35 Still, cases like Equifax, CA, etc., don't seem to incentivize companies to treat PII as toxic waste instead of the new oil or gold. I'm curious how many more big, stupid attacks that'll take.

5856 2018-04-11 14:58:53 Thank you Canada!  US Midcontinent imported 3.041-million barrels per day of crude oil last week, by far a new record. Expect to see numbers above 3-million b/d on a regular basis crossing the border.
5857 2018-04-11 14:58:50 Face it, no one wants to take the risk of transporting your dirty oil.  US didn't want KeystoneXL. Ontario and Quebec did not want Energy East and BC does not want KM.  Clean your oil before you transport it. That will really create jobs.  #StopKM

5861 2018-04-11 14:58:38 Oil at its highest level since 2014 - perhaps the Saudis will get their wish for oil at $80 a barrel a lot sooner than thought yesterday!

5864 2018-04-11 14:58:31 Today people are walking around everywhere around me at work.

This is where shielding is most important.

Crystals help but not always for me. Thankfully I carry black salt with me,  but today I left my protection oil at home.
5865 2018-04-11 14:58:31 Rising oil, rising rates, flattening curve, low U3 is exactly what late cycle looks like. But it could be a long late cycle.

5870 2018-04-11 14:58:14 Pick your reason for the markets downturn today: 
* Crude oil prices continue climbing 
* Investors await Fed minutes
* Escalating geopolitical tensions 
* or the latest gauge of U.S. inflation.

5872 2018-04-11 14:58:11 'Protected' marine area open to oil, gas exploration. Conservationists, union outraged as regulator takes bids for Northeast Newfoundland Slope. Has General Jim Carr declared war on the environment? This guy is  a menace!
5873 2018-04-11 14:58:05 I think using the PF to pay for Government is a mistake. Once upon a time, oil at $70-80 was actually helpful.
5874 2018-04-11 14:57:59 Oh...and I never said "eliminate" ff. It should be refined as close to the source as possible and then shipped...the crap going into that pipe isn't oil...its frigging toxic BITUMEN. Getting this now?
5875 2018-04-11 14:57:56 Why not do your job instead of wasting tax payer money and selling off America's natural resources to your rich oil buddies-You are a WHORE of oil and a disgrace to the Nation-resign or go to jail

5896 2018-04-11 14:56:41 "In Canada, the first phase of Keystone involved the conversion of approximately 864 kilometres (537 mi) of existing 36-inch (910 mm) natural gas pipeline in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to crude oil pipeline service." I would suggest that Harper not get a pat on the back for this.
5897 2018-04-11 14:56:40 Hence EFF is that voice for our people. Any black person against EEF we must force them to drink 2litres of custor oil . Mentally challenged
5898 2018-04-11 14:56:37 I saw something ( can't remember where right now) that stated that coconut oil is 82% saturated fat and, while it may relieve some external conditions, it should never be ingested. Any info on that?
5899 2018-04-11 14:56:36 I’ve said it before, if we want to compete with the oil money clubs then we have to be smarter. This would be extremely smart

5911 2018-04-11 14:55:44 Respectfully, I think that in recent weeks, you have not. As mentioned in my underlying tweet, this is wishy washy propaganda. You cannot attribute a 19% increase in the profitability of Shell to PMB. It doesn't take rocket science to see that it is the rise in crude oil prices.

5960 2018-04-11 14:53:38 Zinke talks about oil and gas as "plays".."an oil and gas play," a "gas play." This is the way a fossil fuel investor talks, not a Secretary of the Interior.

5964 2018-04-11 14:53:25 .@SecretaryZinke is cherry picking numbers from when oil and gas were selling at record levels. Are we at the pants on fire level in his testimony? #ShowZinketheDoor

6020 2018-04-11 14:49:59 I responded to your question. A pipeline makes sense even without an increase in oil production. The safely, the reduced emissions, the ability to open sale to the world market are all huge benefits. Production with change with or without the pipeline....

6098 2018-04-11 14:46:04 OIL RISES TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE DECEMBER 2014
6099 2018-04-11 14:46:02 If we gave as much of a shit about oil as people think, we wouldn’t have put shitloads of sanctions on Russia.
6100 2018-04-11 14:45:51 US oil futures rise highest since dec 2014
6101 2018-04-11 14:45:50 "No Baby Oil!!" Hogan did great impressions of Savage and Andre!!
6102 2018-04-11 14:45:28 Perfectly innocent explanation.  Just trying to sell him some snake oil.
6103 2018-04-11 14:45:21 I decided to learn a new recipe and bake today. I think I added less oil than how the recipe’s suggested. Fingers crossed 
6104 2018-04-11 14:45:17 If crown prince wants reform, first call for local democracy at local level , free and open elections with women getting the vote , free press, more wealth going back into country and into the state. Cut the income the royal family makes from oil by 80 per cent

6106 2018-04-11 14:45:04 lately my favorite has been a mask I made of honey and castor oil leave it on for about 10 minutes, YOUR FACE FEELS SO GOOD AFTER!!! I also exfoliate with a concoction I made of coffee grounds, brown sugar, aloe, honey (ihoney)  lemon juice and something else I can’t think of
6107 2018-04-11 14:45:01 We'll go to the best spa here. Massage with extra... oil.
6108 2018-04-11 14:44:59 the oil meme is THE best meme

6111 2018-04-11 14:44:50 Ah yes, the 3 food groups of Spain... oil, salt, and bread
6112 2018-04-11 14:44:42 depends whether Canada is an authoritarian state which would impose this in the teeth of local opposition, indigineous peoples sovereignty, and the planet's climate in pursuit of corporate interests of Big Oil.

6116 2018-04-11 14:44:36 True, but the school is 150 years old and lacks indoor plumbing. We dropped the ball giving tax breaks to big oil just to be left alone in bed with a note on the pillow.
6117 2018-04-11 14:44:26 Oil prices pare gains as U.S. crude supplies rise more than expected
6118 2018-04-11 14:44:17 Jon, how old are you?   I'm guessing you don't remember the oil bust of the 80s, with people standing in long lines to file bankruptcy.  Oil and gas is an important part of our economy, and why people are so quick to demonize it is beyond me.
6119 2018-04-11 14:44:12 A-hole Because I voted for Trump? Drain my oil and air up my tires chump while I work on getting my promotion to the day shift at  Walmart.
6120 2018-04-11 14:44:09 so i asked if you guys wanted me to make a skin care thread and it got 11 yeses so i will. 
ive had really bad combination skin since middle school. i produce a lot of oil but i have really dry skin on my nose etc. so i've built up a pretty good routine to keep it looking healthy
6121 2018-04-11 14:44:09 I'm so thankful that I have a good mechanic! I'm sitting in Firestone getting an oil change and watching them rip one poor soul after another.

6122 2018-04-11 14:44:05 I'm sorry to be so blunt but this is nonsense. Or have you actually seen olive oil 'proving' in the shade of the spaghetti trees?
6123 2018-04-11 14:44:03 But like oil, it's not necessarily a renewable resource. Once it's gone, it's gone.
6124 2018-04-11 14:43:55 Oh that kind of worry. We have been incredibly blessed, we’ve not had any of those struggles. Which, when you think about it, is amazing considering our breadwinner has worked in the volatile oil industry for two decades.
6125 2018-04-11 14:43:44 Putin, Erdogan, Rouhani, Assad, Jinping & KJU & ALL of your allies need to all come together as a united front.
This isn't about Syria or Russia- it is about the US assassinating another World Leader for oil. 
You CANNOT let this happen again. 
Enough is enough.
6126 2018-04-11 14:43:36 Suck dicks Mr Trump. You should cooperate with Putin and Russia. Instead you put oil into the fire. Let's hope that your ass will not be blow up by Russians. They will kick you out with the tower from Russia.

6130 2018-04-11 14:43:30 They started this pipeline decades ago.  There may have been a case then.  The point the article makes is that recent changes in the market in the last 2 years have made the pipeline obsolete. One change is fracking in the US that yields cheap, higher grade oil.

6180 2018-04-11 14:39:25 I used to mill olive for over 10 years. Quality has improved due to storage in stainless steel and the method of using a centrifuge rather than esparto mat pressing. The quality of oil is vastly superior today. If the ceramic has hairline cracks oxidation can occur.

6201 2018-04-11 14:37:37 Congressman, the argument could be made (not by me) that much of our economy is powered by cheap Saudi oil, and that the Saudis want to control #yemen's unexploited oil wealth as well. So we would have a stake. But is this the kind of people we are? (Non-constituent.)
6202 2018-04-11 14:37:37 .@EIAgov data:  oil inventories rose by 3.3M barrels with gasoline inventories up by 500,000 barrels.  Production increased to 10.53M bpd up from 10.46M bpd in the prior week. #OOTT

6222 2018-04-11 14:35:31 The key is diversification. You can't have 100% RE (unless you're Iceland with tons of geothermal) until storage becomes cost competitive to fossils. Gas is far better than coal/oil. AND it helps with the base load. Actually, gas + RE = a good marriage

6225 2018-04-11 14:35:23 Thanks, Pete! It's more a concern with what I see as missing. It's important to stop this PP health hazard (particularly to the indigenous along the proposed route), and to stop enabling Bakken shale oil projects in NY (which is missing from the focus on fracking).

6233 2018-04-11 14:34:59 "Its your fault" actually.  you buy the products, gas for your car, heat in your house, the plastic in your "tweeting" computer is made out of oil.  If you really believed this you would stop using the products. NO Demand = No production
6234 2018-04-11 14:34:53 Massive yawn in #EmergingMarkets currencies (excluding Ruble and Lira), especially in the Mexican Peso and South African Rand with raising US inflation and potential US/Russia conflict in Syria... all bullish it seems. #MXN #ZAR #usdmxn #usdzar #Forex #Fx
6235 2018-04-11 14:34:53 Baby oil should be your best friend in any relationship
6236 2018-04-11 14:34:46 But won't reduce tanker traffic until Alaska runs dry. Then it's time to get more oil from Alberta, at a hefty discount of course.
6237 2018-04-11 14:34:45 crude build much bigger than expected ... oil stocks may dip on that
6238 2018-04-11 14:34:39 Today is such a good day. The sun is shining, it isn’t nipple cutting diamonds cold out today. I’m getting an oil change. Life is damn good.
6239 2018-04-11 14:34:31 Yes, very true.   However, that's a gain they can only realize now - while oil prices are high and the ruble is weak, the volatility is bad, the rising prices this will mean for imports is bad and the pressure this puts on easing the key rate is bad.
6240 2018-04-11 14:34:30 The Alberta Premier is an oil bully and should leave Canada and Join the rest of the oil bullies in the Middle East then maybe she could see how her attitude is a serious problem #Notleybackoff

6242 2018-04-11 14:34:19 New Zealand has no oil. R U saying their currency is undervalued? Population MUCH less than Scotland. Many countries with no oil trade in their own currency or use the world's default trading currency for their exports, the US $. There are no countries currently insolvent!

6257 2018-04-11 14:33:27 I know you said what can you use along with it that isn’t oil based, but aloe is only 100% beneficial when paired with a LIGHT oil. Aloe only evens skin tone and lightens marks, doesn’t moisturize at all. You might be able to pair it with a cream moisturizer though !

6333 2018-04-11 14:29:01 If oil does keep rising, it could even enter into the macro picture, where a climb in prices may have some impact in pushing up annual inflation measures that remain below the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

6377 2018-04-11 14:25:25 Its same article appeared in March in NDTV. Wont give much importance to byte given when minister is on Pak tour. Its also a ploy to desist Indias ties with Saudi. ( Who today announced US$ 22 billion investment in Ratnagiri for oil project . Total investment is 44 bn)
6378 2018-04-11 14:25:18 Wind and solar are the most wasteful use of oil, natural gas and coal, then. There are other developments in progress in thorium and such-like where the return of energy on energy investment makes more sense.

6380 2018-04-11 14:25:15 Thing is the oil cant bestopped . If it doesn't go by pipeline it will go by truck and rail , which is more dangerous even before its loaded onto tankers. Its not a perfect world , I see concerns , but Alta has a lot of powerful options and they will be used.

6397 2018-04-11 14:23:50 @TomFTroy but i hear the oil and gas/frack attack lobby pays well, so i don't blame you for shilling for them in these hard economic times.
6398 2018-04-11 14:23:30 We don't have to get into the environmental side, as the main issue is with animal slaughter/exploitation. You mentioned that palm oil is vegan yet harmful, so its not as clear cut, though it highlights a failing not in veganisms purview

6400 2018-04-11 14:23:20 @TomFTroy the only candidates for governor that have "written off n.e. ohio" are those who refuse to protect their citizens from the corporate fracking assault.  people are not fond of being poisoned and manhandled for the profit of oil and gas corporations.

6404 2018-04-11 14:22:59 Alta needs to sell its oil . The Feds have commited 1.5 Billion to a west coast clean up process . Maybe Alta could put up a 2 billion dollar bond also. The project puts in a new line and greatly upgrades the old line , which has never had a spill .

I try not to use oil so was wondering would it still work if I left the oil out, is there anything else I could add instead (water, wine, rum)? Thank you.

6414 2018-04-11 14:22:26 saudis definitely, but again only IF Iran engages them in real shooting war, as i said basically shutting their oil industry over night-and by this creating tremendous pressure on all western world to submit and starve from lack of oil..
6415 2018-04-11 14:22:21 Thank you for your question, @GerryRitzxMP. Industrial hemp was legalized in Canada for research and commercial purposes in 1998. Canadian hemp seed oil produced from certified seed has been in production as a food product since then. In 2017, Canada exported $11M in hemp oil.

6429 2018-04-11 14:21:13 Oil/gold is highly correlated; don’t think there’s enough discussion surrounding this. Unsurprisingly if oil breaks out here, I think gold will too...

6435 2018-04-11 14:20:27 Not true! Poor relations with Russia precipitated Russia’s actions. USA has enacted economic sanctions and Russia and USA oppose each other in the artic, oil disputes, human rights, etc.
6436 2018-04-11 14:20:05 So how much has a barrel of oil gone up to. ?
6437 2018-04-11 14:20:01 When looking at where #pollution comes from, the biggest sources in #America are usually overlooked. They are #coal, #naturalgas, and #oil for electricity and personal vehicles.
6438 2018-04-11 14:19:57 A barrel of oil is above $71 a gallon the highest it's been since December of 2014
6439 2018-04-11 14:19:55 This project is a disaster for India from the start. Any project of this magnitude requires 15-20 years of working to recover capital cost. Oil reserves will not last that long. Project going Enron way.

Leave it to #Iran and #Russia; #USA has plenty of oil.
6455 2018-04-11 14:18:16 A big part of the problem is the conflation of conventional fracking, done since the late 40's, and "horizontal slickwater hydrofracking" a new process invented in the late 90's.
The original process was relatively safe, the new process, extremely reckless
Big Oil took advantage

Just pondering.
6460 2018-04-11 14:17:27 So who is “they“, what is their end goal and how does oil price connect to education now?
6461 2018-04-11 14:17:25 Do you mean the revenue from oil?
6462 2018-04-11 14:17:24 Truthfully? We’re after their oil. They have plentiful amounts and by “liberating” them we can either steal it or set up oil trade. It’s been like that forever, it’s probably one of the main factors in the decision to interfere in the Middle East in the first place.
6463 2018-04-11 14:17:23 Switch from winter formula to summer formula. Oil companies claim it is more expensive to make summer gas. Also the trade tariffs issues.

And yes, oil companies (those guys who did the climate research, adapted their business models, and didn’t tell anyone for 20+ years) are awful enough for us to reject them out of hand. #StopKM

6477 2018-04-11 14:16:18 The refinery has to be able to refine bitumen. The one in eastern Canada can, but we cant get out oil there. The flow needs to be reversed and the pipeline extended.  We will be dependent on oil for decades to come. Half of oil produced is for products, not fuel.

6496 2018-04-11 14:14:16 Sadly, I think that is the design...the historical blueprint...it keeps the economic engine humming...Central Valley gives the world oil and produce...there is no value in education or social justice.

6500 2018-04-11 14:13:57 Independent Petroleum Institute? OIL LOBBYISTS. This IPI hasn’t destroyed enough environment so please stop suing them.
6501 2018-04-11 14:13:52 Actually the issue has been oil  pipelines and naval port access Russia needs to be able ship their oil.  But you know that, so why try and blame a political party within the USA for an international issue?  Unless you are trying to distract the people whilst dividing them.
6502 2018-04-11 14:13:50 You are assuming Canada needs to expand our oil market. We don't.  We have enough to be oil self sufficient while we transition away from fossil fuels. Maybe you can explain how growing the Canadian oil industry fights #ClimateChange?

6504 2018-04-11 14:13:34 Submerged in mineral oil.  I've considered it
6505 2018-04-11 14:13:27 I never realized how much I needed baby oil until I left for college. It was just an essential we always had on deck at home and now that I don’t buy it...I always want some
6506 2018-04-11 14:13:24 The Canadian taxpayer has supported the Inuit in the efforts to get their EU exemption honoured, which took an inordinate amount of time because of undue pressures by the ARA. Canada would also sell more seal meat and oil if it wasn't for the propaganda.
6507 2018-04-11 14:13:15 It is more important now than ever to get money out of politics. This revolving door must be shut to stop the flow of dark money & special interest group money like Pharma/Oil/privatized health etc. until we end Citizens United, Ryan & others will continue to Destroy Democracy
6508 2018-04-11 14:13:14 oil derrick on the side of the barn?
6509 2018-04-11 14:13:14 there's no oil lmao, just a daal with vegetables boo, i've had this for the past 5 days, i think i know what's in it
6510 2018-04-11 14:13:10 Toxic people will surface like oil in water !
6511 2018-04-11 14:13:07 Just had a 30min. Discussion with an "oil & gas expert" about contract transparency in the Industry​. Gave my point of holding arbitration tribunals in public  & he disagreed with  "young minds have unconventional solutions"  
Someone take this man's master's degree
6512 2018-04-11 14:12:58 1. She's smartly focused on fracked gas in this statement, which is the overwhelming threat on new infra that destroys water and air quality, heats the climate.  Pilgrim would be an oil pipeline. I'm sure she is opposed to it as well and I am sure you could get that on record...
6513 2018-04-11 14:12:54 Did Orrin Hatch really just ask Mark Zuckerberg how Facebook makes money? It's called advertising revenue. Hey fossil! Let's talk about all that extra income you get from the oil and pharmaceutical companies, shall we?
6514 2018-04-11 14:12:49 Data is the new Ore, just need companies to pull out the rich oil!

6517 2018-04-11 14:12:45 OPEC announced production cuts. If we start bombing Syria, that’ll increase oil prices further. So much chaos in our government and around the world led by the paranoid schizophrenic lunatic man-baby.
6518 2018-04-11 14:12:38 Good god, Vince really wants all the damn oil money possible.
6519 2018-04-11 14:12:37 I recently took my car to the dealership for an oil change and didn’t clean it out post comic con and sending a few cashier’s checks for tax payments. There were black wigs and check stubs for large amounts of money strewn about. Wonder what they thought. 
6520 2018-04-11 14:12:34 Your chart doesn't show alt energy sources. Fuel for cars only accounts for half of oil usage. Research what the rest is for and when you have eliminated every product that uses petroleum from your life I will give merit to your argument. Everything delivered is because of oil.
6521 2018-04-11 14:12:32 I can’t wait until my coconut oil isn’t solid anymore

6524 2018-04-11 14:12:14 Amen.  It needs to be decriminalized so better research can be done on CBD oil.
6525 2018-04-11 14:12:11 Anyone else noticing the raised prices in the supermarkets due to imposing tariffs? Next will be a rise in the cost of oil and gas thus it begins ....
6526 2018-04-11 14:12:02 Yes two teams... oil money or not. City will dominate epl for the next 5 years
6527 2018-04-11 14:11:53 Proud of him? Why not just thank him for the Konza City and oil spill compensation. There are things happening at KPC under his watch

6532 2018-04-11 14:11:32 Mr. President, please bring all troops home to USA and stop fighting these senseless conflicts. Our own country and borders are more important than oil and pipe lines.,!
6533 2018-04-11 14:11:31 Hey @StephenLeDrew, throwing the PM under the bus for caring about equality between men and women as part of an argument for an oil pipeline is not only a stretch, but an insult to the women you work with. As one who used to use the same coffee machine as you at work...

6535 2018-04-11 14:11:19 China  is actually hanging 10 in IRAN and dumping huge investments into its futures ...  they see a real future in Iran’s ambitions to control the Middle East as do the Russians. Hell who got the first Iraq  OIL futures contracts - China 
6536 2018-04-11 14:11:06 That’s the problem, you think it’s because of “treaties”... This has nothing to do with treaties. It has to do with what has always been about... Money from OIL.
6537 2018-04-11 14:11:05 As a former Calgary resident who worked on an oil sands project, I fully support @jjhorgan. When I moved to BC I felt so brain washed by the O&G industry. BC doesn’t want more tanker traffic - we don’t want to live with the risk of a spill when tax money will have to clean it up.

6552 2018-04-11 14:09:34 Crude oil is $71 a barrel. Odd. When price of oil goes down (bad news) UR interest in it goes up & when price goes up (good news) UR interest in it evaporates. Wings exposed your high street shop closing chicanery 2day & why don't U mention 10 whisky distilleries opening in 2018?
6553 2018-04-11 14:09:33 Oil prices are on the rise, Nymex crude for May jumped by $2.09 per barrel, or 3.3%, to $65.51 yesterday, its biggest dollar gain in more than a year. ICE Brent crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, was up 3.5% to $71.04, its highest settlement level since Dec 2014.
6554 2018-04-11 14:09:20 As Light Crude (66.20) retests its 1/25/18 intra-day high of 66.66, impressive upside breakouts are occurring in the following: Oil & Gas Exploration (IEO - 65.93), Oil Equipment (IEV - 47.61), North American Natural resources (IGE - 34.43) and the Energy Sector (XLE - 70.28).
6555 2018-04-11 14:09:01 Have you seen what these oil companies have done to Africa in the name of profit?
6556 2018-04-11 14:08:59 Hi Andrew, we’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change to.

6569 2018-04-11 14:08:03 Top line, bottom line. In techs macro, multi-revenue stream environments, claiming to understand much beyond the above, is fool hardy. Do your DD, but if you think you're an expert on GOOGL, FB, or AMZN operations, you're 99% most likely wrong. Oil is easy, in comparison.

6590 2018-04-11 14:06:13 From my research they say you have to make an oil from medical grade cannabis ~trying strain after strain after strain til you find the “key” to fit your “lock.”  It’s not one size fits all..no telling what strain will help .. just have to keep trying.

I used to break open vitamin E gel caps and rub it on my dogs paws when they got rough. Seemed to help soften them.
6606 2018-04-11 14:05:02 Glad to see Govt finally getting around to introducing legislation to cut off oil shipments to BC - something #UCP has called for since anti-pipeline BC NDP formed govt last summer.

6607 2018-04-11 14:05:00 Any article that refers to Alberta oil by the charged pejorative "tar sands" wears its bias on its sleeve.
6608 2018-04-11 14:04:59 Look, I get it, it seems honourable to go help. When the Iraq War first happened I was seriously all for it. But whether intentions were good or bad (oil for example), or likely a mix, the truth is we made the situation much worse. And if we did it again we'd make it worse again.

6619 2018-04-11 14:03:55 Conservative want to compare @abndpcaucus past statements on oil sands project to past #UCP members statements on abortion.

NDP has listened to the public about oil sands and fight for it.

On abortion, conservative plug their ears and hide.

Oil - rid Asad, put puppet in place, control oil fields.
Land - Israel will take more of Syria and create greater Israel.
Influence - Iran will be alone if Syria falls, thus allowing USA to think about that next. That's why
Russia is the key in all this

6763 2018-04-11 13:51:43 We should have helped the Japanese fix their economy after the attack on Pearl Harbor too.  We could have sold them oil and steel again so they could enslave more people.
6764 2018-04-11 13:51:39 Robert, most people on the planet agree that fossil fuels need to be phased out - over time.  But until you or someone else has an IMMEDIATE. VIABLE. ALTERNATIVE.  

SMH...trying to debate oil with a tree hugger is like trying to debate birth choice with a priest.

6770 2018-04-11 13:51:16 Either some manner of intervention is required, or more civilians are at risk.  It the "can't let the neocons or NWO, or whatever have the ability to fight for oil" nonsense needs to take a back seat while people are being killed in gas attacks by their countrymen.
6771 2018-04-11 13:51:06 Considering recent beta, making any sweeping assumptions is dangerous, but $CPG and $CVE, 2 of the most decimated, high quality, highly oil leveraged Canadian energy equities (trading @ 0.8 to book value) are surging, in recent trading.

6777 2018-04-11 13:50:29 zyikes! we have never had a real price cut in 5 yrs! We were told by @arunjaitley during crude oil pruce crash that price discount will come after 6 months as we use 6 months old stock hence old price is the benchmark.
6778 2018-04-11 13:50:24 This whole notion that “foreign funded” environmental groups are somehow going to destroy the Canadian economy or are influence us poor dumb Canadian enviros is frankly insulting and ignores the fact that they are pushing back against oil groups often many times larger.
6779 2018-04-11 13:50:22 This turbine wheel decided to part ways with the turbo housing. We found it near the inlet of the muffler. We cleaned the oil out of the intake piping and cooler and replaced the turbo. The truck is back on the road making money!

6785 2018-04-11 13:49:25 Oil stock will decrease aggregate supply, increase price level and fall. In the long run, aggregate supply will shifts back if policy makers do nothing. But if policy makers try to boost aggregate demand, the equlibrium will be higher. #ECO2307

6798 2018-04-11 13:48:34 Sounds like your beef is with the oil companies and fuel retailers for not offering it. I have nothing to do with that, and it should be obvious now that they can, if they want. Most industries do not subsidize a competitor. Have an example of that in boating? #ethanol

I mean I remember scores of earnest dudes (and a few women too) telling me that when pot was legalized it would be the end of Big Tobacco and also bring the revolution and also end oil dependency or something.

6809 2018-04-11 13:47:49 Russia were not serious enough to fight there. They weren't interested to stay, not enough oil and gas there. I admit Afghans are fierce fighters known for centuries, but the lessons you must learn from their failure is radicalism, disunity and resistance to change for modernity.

6842 2018-04-11 13:44:43 Exactly. Stopping pipelines doesn’t stop oil demand. Stopping that is the only way to end related pollution. But I’m guessing many aren’t really “that” committed. Instead they stick to hurting other Canadians vs modify thier own actions.

@Wamagaisa Yes when the Qataris discovered oil the entire country changed. The diamonds would have gone a long way to improve people’s lives.
6846 2018-04-11 13:44:02 There isn't any. There wasn't a pipeline crisis when Harper was in power and the PC ran Alberta. The problem is price. Why? Because there is glut of oil. What happens when that glut is increased by more oil from AB? Price will go down. So we maybe stuck with expensive pipeline.

6858 2018-04-11 13:43:07 Yep, Oil/Plastic spent over $6 million in CA to keep plastic bags around (they lost). You'd think they might use all this money to transition to a cleaner way. But nah, they'll go down swinging like Big Tobacco.
6859 2018-04-11 13:43:02 Yes, agreed. There here is nothing wrong with losing an argument. We've all been there.

6866 2018-04-11 13:42:14 I don't have the charts handy, but an overlay of spot crude and gas would show the trend. A quart of motor oil never went down after crude hit 110-120 bbl.
6867 2018-04-11 13:42:13 I'm concerned that you think wind and solar are less expensive relative to oil/gas. I'm for sustainability and alternative fuels but they are NOWHERE near as cost effective. The irrational sentiment stems from believing oil firms are all evil, might as well say all firms are.

6890 2018-04-11 13:40:34 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
6891 2018-04-11 13:40:34 @Meanwhileincana, how do U get around, heat your home, eat, buy the things that oil helps manufacture, deliver, (includ. ur computer)& even recycle? Pontificating ideologues always think they know best.  U try 2 live without ANY petroleum based services, products for 1month.
6892 2018-04-11 13:40:21 I think the only reason we care about Syria is the pipeline and who controls it.

Jordan, Isreal, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Syria, Iran...all of them should be figuring out what do do-not the U.S.

We shouldn’t be involved.  We’ve got plenty of oil here.
6893 2018-04-11 13:40:21 if the retailers got to reduce prices then govt should bring oil and petroleum into GST.
6894 2018-04-11 13:40:20 Britain just did a study, it concluded that is cheaper not to turn on the wind turbines.  All these countries dirty secrets is that they are having to buy gas, oil, wood pellets and other fuels to support their green energy because otherwise their people would have Frozen.

6896 2018-04-11 13:40:19 I thought that is how they controlled the price of oil.
6897 2018-04-11 13:40:11 The same purpose as most of our wars over there, I imagine: To ensure our hegemonic control of the region to keep cheap oil flowing for American companies.

Again, why don't you do some research instead of asking me to do literally all the work for you?
6898 2018-04-11 13:40:04 Petróleo em alta é excelente para Rússia (grande produtora) e EUA (viabiliza o shale oil). Existe a possibilidade da escalada de tensão na Síria ser um jogo de comadres. Ou não.
6899 2018-04-11 13:40:04 Moreover, that evil b!tch ordered Muammar Gaddafi murder and that too is on Democrats because he wouldn't surrender his oil line. He was Putin's FRIEND. It's time you Democrats accept responsibility for your supporting the murdering DNC members & stop pointing at everyone else.

6933 2018-04-11 13:36:53 witch hazel is good toner and jojoba oil or rose hip oil are really good moisturisers they have anti bacterial qualities and are good for helping fade scarring !
6934 2018-04-11 13:36:42 It's great they've put restrictions to save our children. Why then have they removed restrictions on coal, oil companies and other industries that pollute our water and  air? Removed restrictions on financial institutions that tanked the market and the economy in '09.
6935 2018-04-11 13:36:35 It's takes over 400 tons of coal to manufacture one wind turbine, and hundreds of gallons of oil to keep the gears lubed. Not only that, but on offshore wind farms you have construction consumption to consider. It takes over 2 million barrels of fuel to construct 100 turbines.

When my homeowner's insurance doubled, they said that gas prices increased construction costs and that affected insurance, and cost of food, and commodities. Oil drives the cost

All signs for tighter monetary policy and risk-aversion. Bonds and Gold look safe?
6955 2018-04-11 13:34:45 Export oil like there's no tmw and drive the price of oil down, and 40% of Ivan's GDP takes a huge hit, and he can afford squat.

6970 2018-04-11 13:33:37 Chibok scam was all politics. It is the story of inter-ethnic oil politics in Nigeria. A section of Nigeria who believe that Nigeria's political leadershp is solely theirs stage-played the entire thing to embarass the then Presidency. And what a drama it was!
6971 2018-04-11 13:33:35 I spend 6 months a year in Italy, have my own trees and I have never heard of 'proving' olive oil? In what context is this?
6972 2018-04-11 13:33:22 Again geopolitical tensions are driving Brent above $70. As mention before, low levels of inventories + geopolitical tensions can maintain crude prices in these levels. Syria and Iran ‘s tensions are in part incorporated in current prices.

7005 2018-04-11 13:29:43 This has nothing to do with Assad at all.

This is a proxy war between US & Russia, over competing oil pipelines they want to build to supply Europe with oil.

They both go through Syria.

Obama funded 'Syrian rebels' to overthrow Syria, who preferred Russia's pipe.

7014 2018-04-11 13:29:04 I would expect that most oil contracts are hedged against crude price/ FX risk, but the falling Rouble will be felt immediately on (floating rate) USD-denominated debt -- i.e. higher oil prices are a long-term positive, but outweighed by currency decline in the short term.

7016 2018-04-11 13:28:54 it is artificial - the fundamentals are okay - BRENT is at 71 USD and if Iran decides to take part to the show (which they promise to do) - there is not a single tanker moving in the Gulf the day after the attack... (sending oil above 100 USD within minutes)

Hey Americans! Stop lying about it and call it war for food !!
7020 2018-04-11 13:28:33 Misinformation. It's about quality of oil allowed to use protected names. Stainless steel ensures high quality - ceramic urns don't. EU says to get market advantage by using "quality" protected names u must do what it takes to ensure quality oil. You can use urns for generic oil.
7021 2018-04-11 13:28:26 Translation...

7045 2018-04-11 13:26:40 RE: my oil trade at the start of the week.

Rookie mistake. I saw oil hit a long term resistance and was going to go long. But then happened to read someone else's idea of going short and chose their side. Down £110.

If I'd trusted myself, I'd be up £780 now.

7092 2018-04-11 13:21:13 Sure taxes have some effect byit we are still getting screwed because we export oil to USA then import back gas at inflated prices. We need more refineries in Alberta and Canada to have competition. Also gov should look at price fixing greed!

7134 2018-04-11 13:17:35 We know the Deep State is manufacturing the lies that Assad performed the strike.  They just want a reason to keep the war going so they can oust Assad and get rid of another Iran ally in the region. Not to mention the oil pipeline.
7135 2018-04-11 13:17:20 Is a few barrels of oil worth all this? This is the exact reason I voted against Hillary, you said you would get us out of Syria not escalate another war. Warhawks are using you.

Or it's just a show to justify why they don't leave Syria and give up oil fields

7146 2018-04-11 13:15:46 I still have some of the oil. If I knew they were taking it away I would have stocked up. I can’t get with the new smells.
7147 2018-04-11 13:15:38 One of the tortures of the spanish Inquisition was pouring boiling oil into the prisoners throat with a funnel. The meaning of the expression "you have drunk oil" is you have screwed it up, so you are done

7150 2018-04-11 13:15:15 Waffles actually contain more fat in them to make them less sticky. But if you add more oil or butter to your pancake mix it will be very similar to a waffle batter.
7151 2018-04-11 13:15:07 Why was’t the price sensitive ‘conjumer’ passed the benefits when oil was lower, and why is he tied to the front of the jeep now to fave the onslaught. Even the bhakts are beginning to do basic arithmetics now, things dont add up.

7158 2018-04-11 13:14:15 Putin has it.  He just has trouble getting it to Europe because the current pipeline ends in Ukraine & they hate Russia.  That's why Russia attacked Ukraine & we sent troops to help Ukraine.  Syria & Ukraine are both about oil & you're right...we need to drill our own.

Then the dinosaurs came, but they all got too big and fat so they died and turned into oil.

7173 2018-04-11 13:12:56 Several transitional factors held headline inflation low last year, i.e. broadband prices. These transitional factors will start to drop out the y/y calculations at the same time the rally in crude oil prices start to jump into the calculations.. 
It will be painful!
7174 2018-04-11 13:12:50 Let me help you with that .
Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Med. region, which includes Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Syria had 2,500,000,000 barrels.
7175 2018-04-11 13:12:42 Ontario and BC economies are thriving. Alberta, who just started carbon tax is expected to lead country in growth next year. Without 100$ oil. Luck i guess.

7185 2018-04-11 13:11:43 Those most affected along the direct route, are opposed
In order to find aboriginal support  for the project, even FNs far from the pipelines are included. Not being directly affected, they are happy to make deals

7207 2018-04-11 13:09:36 Heheheh, please less oil otherwise you will get fever
7208 2018-04-11 13:09:33 It’s mainly because of taxes! They have raised a lot while oil prices were going down so we didn’t see the hypocritical move! Now that oil prices are going up again! Watch out, it’s going to go stellar !
7209 2018-04-11 13:09:30 Stop lie! Your foreign policy is based on greed and profit only. You launch wars at other countries under a fictitious pretext for getting control of oil/gas fields. You need war to get profits from the sale of weapons. USA killed a lot of people in Syria, Libya, Irak for this!!!

7218 2018-04-11 13:08:16 These paid lies still show up every morning in my feed.   It doesn’t change the fact they oil companies knew about their role in global warming and consulted with climate scientists to determine the risks to their infrastructure and acted based in that guidance.
7219 2018-04-11 13:08:15 Just amazed that oil is not jumping higher... Iran will be targeted too (via their 2000 advisors there) and they will not let it go easily (they officially mention that). The market is in denial...

7226 2018-04-11 13:07:28 It’s not about Syria or Assad. It’s not about terrorism. It’s about Russia and Iran. Establish some “moral” pretext to invade Syria (like WMDs or a supposed gas attack by Assad) so you can fight Russia and Iran. The Caspian Sea oil fields has long been the prize in the region.

7262 2018-04-11 13:03:44 Compared to U.S. prices, we are getting screwed. We produce oil & gas and export it. We pay way too much. Oil prices go up, our pumps price skyrockets, but when oil price falls we barely see a difference at the pumps.
7263 2018-04-11 13:03:43 Is it bad that I go to the same Tire Kingdom for an oil change every two months and the front desk person remembers me? I'm sure he remembers a lot of people though.

7268 2018-04-11 13:03:23 Nixon actually got some things done: he opened relations with red China and founded the EPA.  His stated desire to do away with the oil depletion allowance is probably what caused him to be ambushed and taken down. Compared to Trump, he was a Paragon of intelligence and morality.

Unrelated note:  No I haven't filed my taxes or submitted my bar application yet, why do you ask?
7277 2018-04-11 13:02:52 Okay, it’s Tea-tree oil Shampoo. It’s color safe, and cruelty free. I don’t know if they sell the same one in the U.K. I can send u a picture when I’m home tonight if u like.

Wait wait wait wait wait wait WAIT.  

So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW.
7283 2018-04-11 13:02:29 The spoil is the natural gas and oil Israel has.  They need it, especially Russia.  The alignment of nations in those chapters has recently happened when never before. The preparations are being made.  God's word is never wrong.

7287 2018-04-11 13:02:19 The only reason to go to war in Syria is if you support the corrupt elite and don’t care about the Syrian People. We know how Genie Energy wants the gas and oil fields in the Golan Heights of Syria.

7290 2018-04-11 13:02:04 Russia exports nothing. Oil and communism are their only  products.  Like China they never won naval battle.  A joke.
7291 2018-04-11 13:01:56 Certainly nothing convincing on the digestion front. I thinking meditating for those 10-20mins instead of oil swishing is likely better for digestion 
7292 2018-04-11 13:01:56 OK so you're deluded. Their self interest is not aligned with America and they're not stealing land or oil from Syrians. Arabs have equal rights in Rojava just as Kurds. The same can't be said for Kurds in Syria.
7293 2018-04-11 13:01:50 Unless the Oil pull a move like the Canes and move Chia to a different role? Dunno? I agree on TMAC, I don't think he's going anywhere yet. there was a lot of speculation or discussion on the lack of development on the farm, WHo really know?

7338 2018-04-11 12:58:24 Hi Clare, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

7380 2018-04-11 12:55:38 In most instances, oil is not a "state resource." If OK owns the minerals, then yes, it is a state resource. If a private citizen owns the minerals, it is not a state resource. Subject to tax does NOT = state resource. Private ownership of minerals is fundamentally American.

7402 2018-04-11 12:53:51 And that you can make sense of blood for oil is just more of the same sick mentality.

YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED to even write such bullshit !
7403 2018-04-11 12:53:39 With the exception of oil, not sure if we can expect the same in the US. I'm not an econ expert.
7404 2018-04-11 12:53:33 Would any of you guys support this con-man for a second term? Ted Cruz was so right when he said Trump is a con-man snake oil salesman. He broke all his campaign promises except for TPP.
7405 2018-04-11 12:53:23 International observers ??? you wouldn't be referring to that spineless, useless organization known as the United Nations, bought and paid for with Saudi oil money would you ?????
7406 2018-04-11 12:53:22 Passed my keys off at 7:50. Let's see how long the dealership takes on my oil change today.
7407 2018-04-11 12:53:19 Hi Brian. Currently 50% of all supermarket products currently contain palm oil. Foods like pies, cakes, packaged bread, biscuits, pizza, ice cream, chocolate… the list goes on…
7408 2018-04-11 12:53:11 遅くなってごめんなさい！オススメでお願いします！！
7409 2018-04-11 12:53:09 Also wonder where all that crude oil is going to come from to feed this monster? ................... I am definitely guessing it is coming from the US?
7410 2018-04-11 12:53:02 They just want your oil and will do anything to achieve it

7413 2018-04-11 12:52:55 Well USA always "protect" countries with oil. And fight agains "terrorist" in this countries. And then "help" them to sell oil and spending money. This is not about weapon, freedom or something else. This is only about oil.
7414 2018-04-11 12:52:53 そこはほんとすまんなって思う。
7415 2018-04-11 12:52:46 Hot oil!
7416 2018-04-11 12:52:46 #Syriahoax #Syria Why is it that we never see any witness to the atrocities? Only accusations. No reliable sources, only highly regulated and controlled media news outlets. It wouldn't have anything to do with the Israeli Genie Oil drilling rights led by Rothschild & Dick Chaney.
7417 2018-04-11 12:52:44 US Mil industries complex wants some action cause it feeds the billionaires. Russia wants a little harmless bluster cause it drives oil prices. Neither will do anything material to the other. It's a bluff, the taxpayers & consumers are being taken.
7418 2018-04-11 12:52:43 Who's heard of CBD oil and wants more info??
7419 2018-04-11 12:52:40 This is not over, far from it.  The oil will get to tide waters.  Energy East will also be revived.
7420 2018-04-11 12:52:33 Cool!! Do u think the 10 step is better than using facial oils?
Previously whatever I used didn't help me much in terms of hydration so I switched to using rose hip oil and saw the difference. What brand and types of oil do u usually use? Care to share? ^^
7421 2018-04-11 12:52:25 Indians need to shift their attention from selfishness to selflessness. Oppons continue to blame BJP's Modi for unemployment, farmers' suicides, oil prices & scams etc. What has oppositions done? 
#If this is modi's responsible alone then I think other parties need not to exist.
7422 2018-04-11 12:52:22 The war playbook.  Long Oil and Gold, short stocks.  That's what is playing out here, and from all indications US is alot closer to Syria strikes.
7423 2018-04-11 12:52:16 So, are you still surprised by the spread Bunds - T10?

Look the oil...
7424 2018-04-11 12:52:13 The US used chemical weapons on Native American Protesters at #NoDAPL and had security forces attack Natives. Will you be firing missiles at those animals from the Oil company anytime soon?

7428 2018-04-11 12:51:49 Not for oil that’s just a COVER! It’s to usher in one world government ruling out of JOO USA SALEM
7429 2018-04-11 12:51:35 But how will we protect our oil?
7430 2018-04-11 12:51:14 Got it. Thanks. Texaco's captain field is nearer and I see they are employing EOR on that field. So might be in their interests to get other oil coming in from nearby field. #i3e
7431 2018-04-11 12:51:08 Cannabis is kind of a miracle plant.  The oil is healthy as a vitamin supplement, works great when spread on cuts and burns, a great pain killer, and one acre of cannabis can produce enough hemp for paper/clothing then 100 acres of trees.  Good luck Mr. Boehner on this endeavor.
7432 2018-04-11 12:51:00 Excuse I meant to say: can cats stop on it when their wet, like Vegas roads after a rain storm. The oil and carbon black will stay on the surface of the paint!  Pretty sure the paint should be non-porous?

7458 2018-04-11 12:49:07 It most certainly does. More than 95% of our oil is sold to the US. If against all logic Trump decided to implement an America first agenda on oil too. We don't have someone to sell 95% of our oil to. The pipeline brings our products to new markets. #cdnpoli

7502 2018-04-11 12:45:38 @JustinTrudeau the majority of Canadians are opposed to pipelines. Wouldn't a refinery located in Alberta next to the oil sands make a lot more sense then transporting dangerous bitumen thousands of km across sensitive ecosystems and waterways

7517 2018-04-11 12:44:16 Why would we give a shit about Russia's economy? They are not big and they contribute nothing other than oil. We can't let their corrupt political and economic system infect the rest of the free world. No. Do not entertain. Do not court. They are worth nothing and are a danger.

7542 2018-04-11 12:42:38 You see the big rise in production beginning 2011, that started with Hamm's Continental drilling in the SCOOP.   Without tech they brought to OK, that doesn't happen.  They spent money and worked at figuring out the SCOOP.   Without that, our state would have very little oil prod

7669 2018-04-11 12:32:00 Is he talk about Petroleum Product or Pakoda Making Oil Product?
7670 2018-04-11 12:32:00 Nothing better than a full tank a gas and a fresh oil change.
7671 2018-04-11 12:31:59 Why do you support bombing other countries that no one visits, which only serve your oil interests, ahead of fixing up communities like Flint, Michigan?
7672 2018-04-11 12:31:56 That’s what this line is for? Hell all I needed was motor oil & some 4-10 shells and you can’t get in.

7674 2018-04-11 12:31:48 As a bonus, you can also cook with coconut or avocado oil, so feel free to buy in bulk :D

7679 2018-04-11 12:31:09 Iraq was a lie Libya was a lie
There weren't those chemical weapons!The war was for oil & for a corrupt money system to be saved!
Those countries as Syria, Russia wanted to sell their oil, gas on a new way to avoid petrodollar!
The biggest lie is Syria &the new war against Russia

7685 2018-04-11 12:30:40 Why does the US care so much about human rights violations in Syria? Why not Africa? Answer: there's no money, no oil, and it doesn't fit the Zionist narrative.
7686 2018-04-11 12:30:30 No one makes a single Christmas pudding without palm oil even Duchy originals contain it. They all claim to be luxury so why put cheap oil in.

7688 2018-04-11 12:30:09 So calling out the MIC constantly taking over oil rich countries, then sending in their oil people[see: history] is akin to racism against an Asian person?
I'm pretty sure most people that sign up don't do so to kill foreign leaders for their natural resources.

7692 2018-04-11 12:29:46 He said that Russia needs help with its economic situation in his next tweet, a key issue with Putin's cronies loosing a fortune last week. Let's see how oil prices (Russia's key export) will be affected by the strikes. I think Mr Trump does know how to play chess (or poker)!

7695 2018-04-11 12:29:28 Oh so oil and gas are not profitable? That's sad and surprising. Energy companies are not going to leave from where the resources are, they just want to protect their profit levels for those at the top. Lost jobs is an empty threat. That's a weak argument.

7698 2018-04-11 12:28:59 Trump's #twittertheater today is probably mainly about driving up the price of oil to help fill Russian plutocrat and state budget coffers.

Check the pre-tweet stock-market trading of his inner circle for confirmation.

7733 2018-04-11 12:25:12 Its not over chemical weapons. Its over Oil and the fact that they are still on the gold standard just like Suddam was. Iraq and Syria didn't was to COMPLY with the IMF.

7735 2018-04-11 12:25:08 Whilst we do find it hard when the barns fall silent & what farmer wouldn’t, we do enjoy the banter and general excitement of having lots of people working together and getting the job done. We also feed and oil well, I think this is why people come back to do it year after year!
7736 2018-04-11 12:25:05 This probably has something to do with the recent opening of a Chinese backed port in southern Iran. An interesting question is: is this oil purchased in Petroyuans?
7737 2018-04-11 12:25:00 Norway cut Education and Health spending during the last oil crash. In Scotland our Barnett funds actually increased. The Norwegian fund is for future pensions and highly restricted for use on current spending.

7741 2018-04-11 12:24:39 Under Gaddafi, Libyans didn’t pay for electricity or education, homes were a human right, couples received money on being married and for each child they had, there was 0 interest on loans, Libyans received a small share of oil sales... Is it any wonder the West hated him?

7767 2018-04-11 12:21:53 Much happening in the gulf region so fast. Oil prices looking to shoot upwards if situation escalates. 

Action in the ME will have collateral effect in Yemen, Sudan, UAE, even Qatar especially if S. Arabia joins in.

7798 2018-04-11 12:17:36 Let's hope Iceland has found properly sustainable sunflower and rapeseed oil and that they will remove the inherent animal cruelty in butter and lard.
7799 2018-04-11 12:17:28 So Putin isn't trying to control Syria for oil. Come on, you're not thinking rationally. Russia has shown it wants to control the area Paula. For what reason? Why did Putin go into Crimea? He is a former KGB officer. He's a bad guy
7800 2018-04-11 12:17:26 Russia, Iran and China are NOT NK. He's doing this at the behest of Israel! They have already sold the rights to pump oil in Syria!
7801 2018-04-11 12:17:15 Agreed, and if you cut the oil and gas supplies from Russia, they will fall into shape pretty quickly too.

TRUMP THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE.

7817 2018-04-11 12:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however government benefits.
7818 2018-04-11 12:16:04 So it is ok for the US to bomb the shit outta somewhere for oil but call others when they bomb somewhere , why does the US always think it's ok to stick their big noses in other countries when their own country isn't perfect.
7819 2018-04-11 12:15:25 This whole scenario was scripted months ago. Iran will be pulled in because when it comes to oil, they're a rogue nation, & are ignoring OPEC quota restrictions. Oil. It's always about oil. At home, & abroad. Oil is the crystal meth of politics.
7820 2018-04-11 12:15:11 an “intervenor” doesn’t a mean a thing. Harper attempted to streamline an inefficient process.  The Liberals have now made it worse, and have destroyed billions of dollars of investment for Canadians. Why don’t you protest the imported oil flowing into Irving’s refinery?

7826 2018-04-11 12:14:43 WWIII must not be fought for Syrian oil and land. Golan Heights oil must not be disregarded. International law must be obeyed by all countries at all times. Otherwise we get WWIII.
7827 2018-04-11 12:14:42 KM was prepared to put up $7 billion, so I think there is a market for Alberta oil. Gotta be better than using oil from oppressive countries,
7828 2018-04-11 12:14:39 There's a really good metaphor about big data being 'oil' at the current @PaxTechSolution session - @SmartSky4G is the pump, delivering oil in real time, but @blackswandata is saying first, ppl need to decide which oil is needed to solve their problem! #AIX18 @theAPEXassoc

7830 2018-04-11 12:14:34 I was sick ALL day yesterday. The deli lady used the same tongs she used on the chicken to grab my fries. I’m assuming they cooked the fries in the same oil as the chicken too. Ughhh this is the 2nd time I’ve accidentally ate meat. It literally feels like you have the flu

7834 2018-04-11 12:14:15 We could help the Russian economy by dropping sanctions, allowing sale of $500 billion in government oil, allowing Putin to invest in invading neighboring countries. See, every body is happy. Except those in the invaded countries.....
7835 2018-04-11 12:14:00 I'm actually starting to think we'll see a "buy the rumor, sell the news" oil event happen once the bombings happen. Though I was wrong when I thought the same back in November for OPEC's meeting I admit. Of course a bullish EIA probably keeps this up. We will see.,

7842 2018-04-11 12:13:22 Since Putin and his mobsters/oligarchs are all doing just fine looting their own “economy,” I sincerely doubt any other country could help change that, unless what you really mean here is that you want to make billions personally from Arctic oil and/or real estate in Moscow.

7844 2018-04-11 12:13:11 This is really about control of an oil pipeline, always has been.  The  Donald is trying to pull a fast one cause it's just about over and the US blew their big chance ages ago.

7854 2018-04-11 12:12:34 After plundering and grabbing the oil resources in Iraq and Libya, next comes Syria.
7855 2018-04-11 12:12:09 Nope!! I don't support KILLING where we haven't been attacked, or compromised ... and all we have is the BS from someone who has LUSTED for SYRIAN OIL  for who knows how long, Dawn. He is DISHONEST, RUTHLESS & ruled by GREED. I don't support MADNESS.
7856 2018-04-11 12:12:04 I think you need to brush up, the red in the nazi flag was specifically to symbolize their allegiance to socialism. They had a friendship until Hitler needed more oil. They are all just evil dictators. To say that fascism was a right wing ideology is absurd.
7857 2018-04-11 12:12:01 You’d rather keep our resource in the ground, degrade our economy & healthcare, rely on middle eastern blood oil that has to be loaded into an infinite flotilla of cargo ships (cuz they never crash & spill)& sailed around the globe? Perverse.

7929 2018-04-11 12:04:24 以前からS14ミッションの入りが悪いとの事、レットラインも考えましたが、リスクが多いので　色々考えましたが　お客様の体感出来るペンズOILに入れ替え　デフLSDもイニシャルトルクが大きいのでガキガキ音から踏んでソフトなデフOIL交換　エンジンOILは勿論LUBTECH　体感出来て満足みたいでしたね

7936 2018-04-11 12:03:42 Like black OIL on me.
7937 2018-04-11 12:03:32 Ever sit and watch the sunrise while ripping your oil pen and say "Damn I'm pretty blazed why am I up right now?"?
7938 2018-04-11 12:03:29 thanks Reid for the reply. i know @sainsburys have worked hard at reducing packaging but shouldn't the end goal be 100% free of oil based plastics?including the suppliers you use. As there are vegetable based plastics available etc that don't hurt the environment.
7939 2018-04-11 12:03:25 On the tweets I tweeted there are no suggestions of using paper INSTEAD of plastic. If you're thinking about buying milk and oil you should think about using jars? Now how about that as an alternative?

7946 2018-04-11 12:02:51 Oil through the roof this morning, looking to short it via $DRIP
7947 2018-04-11 12:02:51 Nice
Who is supplying the Olive Oil?
7948 2018-04-11 12:02:49 It's bollocks - Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil and other 'top dogs' I suppose (when it comes to certifying 'sustainability' palm oil) are so bloody corrupt - a lot of the #palmoil workers kill orangutans because they are considered pests..child labour..human rights abusers etc..
7949 2018-04-11 12:02:37 The cute dude that changed my oil watches Supernatural and I think I’m in love. Lol.
7950 2018-04-11 12:02:34 OIL DIFF: 5.85 -> 5.9
7951 2018-04-11 12:02:34 yes you only interested in oil,and there is oil in syria
7952 2018-04-11 12:01:42 Is it just me or is everyone on Nigerian twitter a brilliant oil painter?
7953 2018-04-11 12:01:15 all of these oil pastel paintings are actually insane wtf
7954 2018-04-11 12:01:14 モトコンポ始動キーをONにした時に、スピードメーターに付いてるOILランプが数秒点灯しますが、異常ではありません。そのまま点灯し続ける場合は2ストオイルを補充しましょう。
7955 2018-04-11 12:01:07 Before traveling offshore in the UKCS, oil and gas employees must undergo an offshore medical to ensure they are fit to do so. #myoilandgascareer #workingoffshore #offshore
7956 2018-04-11 12:01:01 Actually I live in reality. The YPG are "Communist revolutionaires"  but their self interest is aligned with US so that involves stealing land and oil from Syrians (aka "fighting terrorists") very left wing, I guess you prefer Owen Jones' patronising delusions.
7957 2018-04-11 12:00:43 I've never shopped at @IcelandFoods but will certainly try them now. It puts the other plastic and palm oil guzzlers like @MarksnSpence to shame, so hopefully it'll force them to follow suit.
7958 2018-04-11 12:00:26 Yeah I know. Gonna give my rifle an oil tonight, might see about getting some more long term food. Good luck
7959 2018-04-11 12:00:17 Terrifying that people beliebe all the false flags plastered all over the media. Just another country to farm oil from #wakeup

7961 2018-04-11 12:00:11 A well oiled machine. Just like my first car that burned a quart of oil every week.
7962 2018-04-11 12:00:10 Oil (Brent) is marking 71.844, surpassing the historic 3 year high of 71.355 by 0.685%
7963 2018-04-11 12:00:07 Moreover, I have called for a drought that will affect the fields, the hill country, the grain, new wine, fresh olive oil, a... Haggai 1:11
7964 2018-04-11 12:00:05 Why don't you go back to country Mexico you taxpayers getting tired you people need to stay in you country fight you president asking to help you you people got oil tell you government where the money go this is NOT OUR PROBLEM so STOP crossing OUR Borders
7965 2018-04-11 12:00:05 Hi there, I can see that we have 2 types one is care clove oil at £1 and the other is Bell's clove oil at £2.69.  We should have the same price in store, so if you could let me know which store this is I can contact them on your behalf to clear this up.

^SK
7966 2018-04-11 12:00:04 Saying that you are basically saying that you are a terrorist by association. Being an American and a consumer of oil.  I'm no terrorist. I'm a proud American but at the same time I'm not always happy about what is happening.  Basic human principal of survival. We all have it!
7967 2018-04-11 12:00:03 My family can no more get along with your family than oil mixes with water.
ぼくの家族と君の家族が仲良く過ごせるというのは，水と油が混ざるというくらいありえない話だ。
7968 2018-04-11 12:00:03 TIP stumped for a topic? Perhaps speak to how you apply the tools of skepticism in your hobby or occupation (snake oil in hi-fi audio, e.g.)
7969 2018-04-11 11:59:35 Chicken in chief is on the run! He sees the oil being poured into the fryer and is gonna burn down the kitchen before the CHEF gets the oil hot ENOUGH! OBSTRUCTION is on the menu and CHUMP and his loyalists are trying to hide the UTENSILS!
7970 2018-04-11 11:59:34 Dolar is bigger than four
Euro is bigger than five
Oil is bigger than six
But Reyiz is bigger than all :-)
7971 2018-04-11 11:59:30 This will add to many rules that taxis break without repercussions. #JoburgBylaws are nothing but a book if they are not implemented. I hope they include fines for vendors who sweep plastics and pour cooking oil into drains,causing blockages which leads to flooding when it rains.
7972 2018-04-11 11:59:28 US launches strikes, people die on both sides. A ground war starts, it gets out of hand, nukes are used, we all get to experience the hell of war.

All over oil and gas.

7975 2018-04-11 11:59:14 War on Syria is about stealing oil, pipelines and land.
It is not about a video of a clear eyed child hosed down by man in casual dress.
No eye irritation in child. No protective clothing on man.
Independent analysis of facts must be taken to comply with international law
7976 2018-04-11 11:59:08 Indian Government should also act with good governance for responsible OIL PRICING in the country to enable common man to live a Happy Life.
7977 2018-04-11 11:58:55 Assad is poisoning his opponents while the Trump Administration wants to slowly poison us by allowing the oil, dirty energy and car industry to pollute our air and water.
7978 2018-04-11 11:58:52 เพราะเริ่มโฟกัสลำบากแล้ว
7979 2018-04-11 11:58:35 @narendramodi @PMOIndia @drharshvardhan Indian Government should also act with good governance for responsible OIL PRICING in the country to enable common man to live a Happy Life.
7980 2018-04-11 11:58:23 who wants too fight me? Naked in oil.
7981 2018-04-11 11:58:20 I’ve started taking coconut oil. Heat it until it’s liquid but not hot. Then stir in a tablet of crushed camphor for each cup of oil. Seems to reduce inflammation and increase circulation in my shoulders. Massage in a little but test to make sure Ur skins not sensitive to it 1st.
7982 2018-04-11 11:58:08 แต่น่าจะสั้นเพิ่มเยอะเลย 200+ แหงๆ

7987 2018-04-11 11:57:39 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.

7989 2018-04-11 11:57:07 Ah, so that's why they want in on the Syria offensive. Nothing like geopolitical risk to get their oil price moving ...
7990 2018-04-11 11:57:02 Hahahaha.
Trump Irony.
Not even 8 am yet.

(Trump has crashed the Ruble & spiked Oil already this morning).
7991 2018-04-11 11:57:00 Why wouldn’t the rebels losing in Douma want to cast blame? 
And since when are US, Israel, UK, France the rulers of sovereign state of Syria? 
This is not our land, these are not our people.
Who benefits from taking oil and land from Syria?
It is not Europe.

7997 2018-04-11 11:56:37 British Petroleum is who got the contracts to sell that oil, not the US. We knocked over Libya as a favor to Italy and the UK, not for ourselves. 

I admire your pointless sentence fragments though
7998 2018-04-11 11:56:19 This would be a time to lower the price of oil and start using some our own.

8009 2018-04-11 11:55:24 looks military strikes in Syria are imminent-- Let us see how Russia - Iran- China- Syria counter it --  it appears anti msl systems already in place- last week however such systems were jammed from unknown sources - oil prices will shoot
8010 2018-04-11 11:55:22 Yep, spot on. But there are quite a few floating voters out there that still believe that Scotland's only resource is oil and if we lose that then we have literally nothing. Jill's basically targeting those people with doubt and fear in the hope they'll vote No again.
8011 2018-04-11 11:55:21 @Morning_Joe. Joe Mr. Coon is right, we do need to hold RUSSIA accountable, but ignorant Scared Coward lunatic PUTIN PUPPET TRUMP doesn't know how to carry out a policy to do it. @Morning_Joe.  He should increase very hard more santions on them, like restrict their oil intake.
8012 2018-04-11 11:55:21 USA terrorists who killed Gaddafi because he wanted to sell Libya's oil  with Gold and not US Dollar. And now Libya is a failed State without Gaddafi.

8019 2018-04-11 11:54:32 Must not have enough oil or resources the USA want to warrant helping them. Just remember America is the world's police for hire, we don't do anything for free over here, including freeing people from persecution, malice, and genocide, as well as rape, pilage, and plundering
8020 2018-04-11 11:54:31 u kno when ur rubbing tanning oil on urself n the sand is sticking all over u n u smell like coconut n banana.... i need that
8021 2018-04-11 11:54:30 Tesco at Southam have increased the price of Unleaded and Super Unleaded by 3p per litre despite no rise in the price of crude oil.
Shell petrol station at Southam now cheaper than Tesco.
8022 2018-04-11 11:54:30 Ok how many wars has America been in since becoming independent 200 odd years ago? I've got the stat in my timeline somewhere and we all know usa loves its oil hence Lybia who dropped the us dollar and then needed some American liberation eh!
8023 2018-04-11 11:54:30 @NigeriaFMYS
True sport we can relief crimes among the youth in the county rather investing our time in petrol  and crude oil . I am ready to face anyone to say the truth you are bastard and foolish. I am a sport coach and I know the quality of the sport.

8027 2018-04-11 11:54:12 Foreign intervention in Bosnia in 90s defended Muslims and had nothing to do with oil.  Syrians are suffering now.  Don’t you feel the need to do something when you see pictures of dead children as a result of chemical weapons attack?  Is there a better alternative?
8028 2018-04-11 11:54:09 Trump is not an idiot it's a puppet of the Zionist that want war over in Syria so they can run an oil pipeline to the U.K.
8029 2018-04-11 11:54:09 majority of #CDN s aren't anti oil. We're pro environment @MooreintheAM
8030 2018-04-11 11:54:09 stop thinking dollars and elections. This affects all Canadians. Oil is obsolete. Help Alberta evolve, invest in new sectors.
8031 2018-04-11 11:54:02 The long one is a Clyster. In the upper left? A "new earthen pot" inside another (olla terrea nova, is what it's called in the text). I've seen that emphasis on "new pots" before. Something about it being new is important to the preparation process. Interesting 'oil of juniper.'

8036 2018-04-11 11:53:08 Shell Nigeria saw oil production up 10% year-on-year in 2017

According to data released Tuesday, @Shell_Nigeria ’s oil production averaged 631,000 b/d of oil equivalent in 2017, bolstered by output from onshore and shallow water assets, @PlattsOil reports.
8037 2018-04-11 11:52:53 Indonesian media is horrible when it come to reporting even factual news like this and what this press conference was about all about, just one quick halfbacken news and everyone copies... yet very little about the oil spill, it's impact and responsibility by pertamina ;)
8038 2018-04-11 11:52:47 There has got to be complete transparency of the Uganda government shareholding in the new oil refinery with annual publication of audited financial statements for public disclosure. #Uganda

8044 2018-04-11 11:52:09 Sadly, the Peruvian place isn’t there anymore. That was Mochica. Gjelina in Venice (on Abbot Kinney) has spectacular olive oil ice cream!
8045 2018-04-11 11:52:08 I am not attracted by a “ I can’t believe it’s not Tory” Brexit; I’ll have good Greek, Italian or Spanish olive oil on whichever side my bread is lubricated.
8046 2018-04-11 11:51:37 Added to #PANR just looks like a steal down here. Oil prices at a high.
8047 2018-04-11 11:51:29 อย่าว่าเก้นนนนน
8048 2018-04-11 11:51:26 Well on one hand the doomsday clock is practically at midnight and the world is on the verge of becoming an apocalyptic wasteland, on the other hand increased oil prices might mean I can buy a better water maker for my fallout shelter. 
8049 2018-04-11 11:51:16 So!!! As we reduce this attraction force (IFT) then the oil mobility will be improved, thus oil production will increase.

8055 2018-04-11 11:50:52 Well, @SenJohnMcCain How about you enlighten us on US-deals with Saudi Arabia who are funding Army of Islam who posess & have used chemical weapons on civilians? While you're at it, tell us about your actual motivation which is, again, oil and gas. Like Ukraine, like Iraq..
8056 2018-04-11 11:50:51 The goal is to bring corp back here.. they are not hiring? Sniffing to many food fumes? Take a look at the employment numbers.. look ho many jobs are going unfilled bc of lack of qualified candidates.. get off the hot oil
8057 2018-04-11 11:50:48 @OttawaMorning "spillover" was a funny choice of word by your Albertan guest when he listed the virtues of an oil pipeline.
8058 2018-04-11 11:50:38 Houthi group said on Wednesday it had launched a drone strike on a facility belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in southern Saudi Arabia - though the company said its plants there were operating “normally and safely”.

8060 2018-04-11 11:50:03 The palm oil I've seen brought development to developing countries. It's true that natural resources were depleted to a point where local communities and wildlife suffered and that's why certification is crucial. It works and I've seen it on the ground.
8061 2018-04-11 11:50:03 Love when I oil my hair and skin and just lay in smelling delicious
8062 2018-04-11 11:50:00 POTUS, as Leader of the Free World, must both comply with, and be seen to comply with, International Law. Bombing sovereign state of Syria on the wishes of land & oil grabbers in the region is so not a good look.
8063 2018-04-11 11:49:53 And with your kind of thinking, we'd still be sailing around hoping to find a single whale left so we could have oil for our lamps.

Petroleum is a dying industry.  It will soon be replaced, just as whale oil before it. But Alberta wants us to invest in harpoons.
8064 2018-04-11 11:49:48 The west will never learn that military intervention only ever creates more destruction and instability in Middle East. Or they have learnt it but only care about oil and their own financial gains
8065 2018-04-11 11:49:41 I saw a video of a woman putting motor oil on her fish. She definitely shit out some engine gunk afterwards.

Poin terakhir ini yg paling penting.

8077 2018-04-11 11:48:47 To be precise, America is mainly carrying out the Interests of the Zionists in the Middle East. Part of a  plan made by a think-tank back in 1997 of wich John Bolton was a part just as Dick Cheney, who is now member of the board of Genie's GOGAS which is drilling for oil in Golan

8084 2018-04-11 11:47:31 The point is that the US does  produce  little WTI crude oil but mostly condensate. So, we have to scrap all cars and run transportation on LPG.
8085 2018-04-11 11:47:25 Im a licensed Cosmetologist have you tried putting deep conditioner and going under a dryer with a cap on for 5-10 minutes it works wonders for me when I’m working on texture clients a little heat protectant coconut oil after you rinse conditioner out and about to style
8086 2018-04-11 11:47:20 America will never be paid in any fashion -- via oil or money, etc.  
As for stability -- you are correct.  Stability in the world should be our goal, but we cannot continuously reinforce this militarily.  There will be consequences for that.  But we will have to let chips fall.

8089 2018-04-11 11:47:09 $USDZAR and $USDMXN are such reluctant participants in this EM selloff. $MXN to some extent makes sense with oil bid. When Rand joins in it feels like, "oh... if I have to..."

8092 2018-04-11 11:46:49 No one ever got fired for pouring oil on a wildfire
8093 2018-04-11 11:46:49 they can generate power by Oil but they cant because that would minimize the profit !!
8094 2018-04-11 11:46:45 Our current heating oil price is at $2.799 per gallon (pay within 10 days and get 5 cents off per gallon)
8095 2018-04-11 11:46:40 Russia can beautifully exist without the help of th USA. on the contrary the US is always in need of precious metals and oil. For the remaining part they have always neighbouring countries to supply whatever falls short.
Big mistake on the US side.
8096 2018-04-11 11:46:39 To be honest I’ve never tried ‘scratching’ with olbas oil. Chilli can be good but peppermint oil is definitely bad
8097 2018-04-11 11:46:33 WWIII over the Russian controlled oil pipeline and a fake gas attack?  Really?  I guess you are just like HRC after all.
8098 2018-04-11 11:46:26 People in the lower half of tax brackets don't give a damn about oil politics nor how it relates to the military
8099 2018-04-11 11:46:25 Is it Assad...where is the proof. My money is on UK Israel  Saudi Arabia and America because lets face it the oil  and control of it is more important than life.

8132 2018-04-11 11:43:23 Absolutely true. It’s a basket case. Biggest country in the world and it’s GDP is about half ours. Without oil and nuclear weapons people would ask. Russia? Who are they?
8133 2018-04-11 11:43:19 On your marks get set go oil pipeline.
8134 2018-04-11 11:43:18 She’s not a robot. I’m from B.C. ... live in Alberta. In Alberta we understand that people across this country need oil. So until you’ve done up with a different way to produce energy, the pipeline is the safest way to transport it.
8135 2018-04-11 11:42:50 And oil for dollars. Syria Iran and others are buying oil with euros not the good ol greenback. This undermines the crurancy and if they can they would collapse the dollar to the point of pennies on a dollar and every American would be fucked and I mean everyone.Iraq did the same
8136 2018-04-11 11:42:31 History teaches us that ALL colonialist & imperialist wars against peoples of the global south were based on LIES.

8143 2018-04-11 11:42:04 If you ask me everything that we have done in the Middle East has been to benefit Shell Oil. They control everything. This Syrian war is to build a shorter pipeline between Syria and Iran bypassing Russian control. This is all about Shell Oil pipeline not gassing his people.

8146 2018-04-11 11:41:29 A 1988 Shell Oil Co. internal report said that climate change was serious, that it would be hard to reverse, that its effects wouldn't be detectable for years, & that Shell added to the problem. Yet publicly it said climate change was unproven and fought efforts to fight it.

8172 2018-04-11 11:38:55 looks like they got what they wanted - oil price heading north again. Was this declaration a co-incidence after the Saudi King's visit? I think not.

8197 2018-04-11 11:36:21 That doesn’t make sense at all. Obviously you learned math in an Oklahoma school. How about you stop giving sweet deals to oil companies? They wreck the environment and take resources, the least they can do is pay their share.

8199 2018-04-11 11:36:08 Trump Tweets impacting markets early on this morning. GOLD surging higher as USD continues to find bottom and drift lower.

8201 2018-04-11 11:35:58 I found the Fresh Farmacy soap from Lush really helped mine. It’s made with lavender and calamine so it soothes redness right away and the lavender also helps your skin balance oil
8202 2018-04-11 11:35:53 BOMBS BLOWING UP SYRIA ISNT THE ANSWER MEN.THATS RUSSIA/CHINA WHY ARE YOU CONSTANTLY FIGHTING FOR OIL WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN...LIKE I SAID ID HATE TO BE THE FIRST TO FIND OUT I WASNT A GOOD PERSON IN THE RESURRECTION.AMEN.THANK U FOR LETTING ME BE A GOOD PERSON IN SUCH A CRUEL 
8203 2018-04-11 11:35:43 No it's called bombing and murdering people for oil.
8204 2018-04-11 11:35:40 At the risk of sounding obvious the Oil Markets are Pricing in a US attack on Syria. #CL #oilprices @HitTheBidRadio we will look at fading some oil gap ups at the open but this could rip higher. Stay nimble stay liquid

8208 2018-04-11 11:35:00 Keep believing that..... just remember Trump added $1 Trillion to our national debt on purpose. Not to fight a war, not to stop opioid addiction just to do it. Remember when we had national parks without strip minds or oil derricks, then make this statement believable.
8209 2018-04-11 11:34:50 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!

8217 2018-04-11 11:34:12 Why would Russia do that? Ousting Assad, his ally, his oil, his base in the middle east? Things are not what they seem. The attack happened in a rebel controlled city - how is that possible? Inside job.
8218 2018-04-11 11:34:00 Thanks Anita. I noted Iceland switch away from palm oil with concern for the Amazon forests and biodiversity in Europe. Cattle industry in particular has been identified as worst for forests. Sunflower and rapeseed threatening oblivion for wildlife in Europe. Neither certified

8220 2018-04-11 11:33:58 Dont think Putin does to be honest its all propaganda created by  America and for the interests of America to stay the dominate force of the world to control the Oil to keep the Dollar/Petro dollar afloat.
8221 2018-04-11 11:33:56 Let them all kill each other and stay out of it. Quit sending them arms. Quit feeding them. Focus on replacement of the petro-dollar fed reserve bullshit. Focus on zero Mid East oil dependency. Build the wall, and close the ranks.
8222 2018-04-11 11:33:51 forget North Korea, USA will attack Syria!

should US axis attack, should and will China get automatically involved?

should China seize Saudi oil fields? - that's how terrorism gets funded

8223 2018-04-11 11:33:47 @maddow So Trump's personal lawyer was working out of the Squire, Patton & Boggs law offices, who just HAPPEN to be lawyers for Cambridge  Analytica, AND are main lobbyists for Russia's Gazprom oil company? WOW.
8224 2018-04-11 11:33:46 They are using Syria to get to Iran.they thinking Iran gets their nuclear arsenal ready they won't be able to control their oil. Time is running out in their eyes.russia need to defend Syria to the death.

8227 2018-04-11 11:33:30 ...over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable.  We are working hard to ensure the remaining volume is converted as soon as possible. Reid 2/2
8228 2018-04-11 11:33:28 Please be assured we are committed to sourcing with integrity. Our Sustainability Plan commits us to sourcing our palm oil sustainably and ensuring our own brand products don’t contribute to global deforestation. By the end of 2016...1/2
8229 2018-04-11 11:33:23 Oil is wonderful!
8230 2018-04-11 11:33:20 USA doesn't need Syria's oil. We're poised to be the world's number one oil producer this year, 2018, surpassing both Russia and Saudi Arabia.

8244 2018-04-11 11:31:51 ,jews want oil & gas..
8245 2018-04-11 11:31:43 Why whould you attack Syria? The war is almost ended. You financed Al Qaida in Syria and killed a lot of innocent people. Assad must resign because of the oil pipe line that needs to be built to the EU. Why don’t you sell your own oil/gas to EU?

8250 2018-04-11 11:31:17 All true. But what it says to me, a non-Albertan, is that the consensus across the entire political spectrum in Aberta is unanimous: the pipeline must be built if the country is to have a viable oil industry. That seems pretty powerful. And it's also quite rare in this country
8251 2018-04-11 11:31:10 Trump, Israel, Murdoch all after the oil - another Iraq!?!?

8263 2018-04-11 11:30:10 Could it be that the discovery of gold in Syria (as well as oil, of course) PLUS the much needed water for 'neighbors' a factor in wanting to overthrow the DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED President?

8268 2018-04-11 11:29:20 It’s only ignorant people who believe in the ‘eye for an eye’ response. Why aren’t the US, France and UK consulting their elected reps on this? It’s just like putting oil on an already flaming fire! The UK should encourage diplomacy. Trump doesn’t know the meaning of that.

8270 2018-04-11 11:29:08 For now, it may not matter. Any dip will be bought until this stupidity with Syria cools down. This just shows how stupid the oil market can be. Syria produces very little oil, and there is no chance the U.S. escalates this and fights Russia. I'll celebrate when this falls.
8271 2018-04-11 11:29:07 Yeah short Gold and Oil was the plan back in January... 
8272 2018-04-11 11:28:49 We need refineries to produce clean oil and sell a finished product rather then discounting our resources to foreigners who couldn't care less about OUR environment. Tars sands oil would destroy west coast if spill happened.

8280 2018-04-11 11:27:39 But they've also spent it well, far as I can see. Encouraged regional development, joined up their east and west railway stations in Oslo, kept as much oil wealth as possible in Norway. (And developed an unfortunate habit of keeping lights on. Nice in winter though.)
8281 2018-04-11 11:27:38 punyaku malah lebih banyak lagii :") aku lagi coba banyak cara tbh dan baru mulai dua bulan (kurang). pakai lulur, sama bio oil.

katanya bio oil ampuh tapi harus rutin dan min 3 bulan. harganya juga mahal :') tapi kalo lihat review youtube itu awet senenernya.
8282 2018-04-11 11:27:33 Thank you - only by getting together we can transform the palm oil industry for the better. What do you think is the most important step to make sustainable palm oil the norm?
8283 2018-04-11 11:27:33 Why shout fire, brimstone, and Armageddon over a problem that might never arise. The risk of flying on a plane, I believe, is the greatest risk any people can take, compared to the risk of an oil spill. Yet the risk of an accident doesn’t stop them because of the benefits.
8284 2018-04-11 11:27:32 No, don't take the old fields.  Instead, take the oil fields.

8291 2018-04-11 11:26:47 This war on Syria is about stealing oil, pipelines and land and it is not about a video of a clear eyed child hosed down by man in casual dress. No eye irritation in child. No protective clothing on man.

8293 2018-04-11 11:26:38 Nonsense. Opponents simply understand that these bogus wars are all about empire and the need of Western powers to monopolise oil and gas supplies and that there is no level to which they won't sink to achieve that. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya - murderous proxy wars one and all.

You should have intervened many months ago so why not? Oil prices too low that’s why.
8296 2018-04-11 11:26:24 Technically City still have two, fair enough the third is coming, but that’s no surprise when the club is made of oil money and had to buy success.  Also, Liverpool might not have won the league for 28 years, but the only club that has caught up is Man United.

8302 2018-04-11 11:25:15 But oil price will go up, thats for sure. 100 dollars per barrel, at the very least. Winners:Russia, the US Losers:China,India as largest oil importers
8303 2018-04-11 11:25:14 And you lot will fall down that massive gap again after spending the equivalent. I love the oil 
8304 2018-04-11 11:24:50 You really need diagram? Bullet points for the dumb.
Exclusive oil deal with Russia for 2.5 billion barrels of oil.
Russia exports it cutting US exports of oil. 
Russia drops export oil prices.
Oil price drops USA loses billions of dollars in lost exports and revenue.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life; And you will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever.
8313 2018-04-11 11:23:40 When you sell oil you are paid in dollars. Govt. then sells the dollars to CBN for Naira to spend locally. CBN now has dollars they can sell to importers.
During the dollar squeeze of 2016 dollar inflows dropped drastically due to low oil prices & production cuts.
8314 2018-04-11 11:23:35 Hydraulic Fracturing is incredibly disastrous to water, air & land.
A massive amount of chemicals & fresh water that is used & contaminated, during the drilling, fracturing & gas/oil extraction process, is the equivalent of ecological disaster for each well.

8335 2018-04-11 11:20:13 Although i do have some who actually do! glad your no one of them,but markets are poor at changing quickly and oil/coal is another case of it!
8336 2018-04-11 11:20:02 Yes let's all buy oil cause supply is going to get crushed.
8337 2018-04-11 11:19:53 I can change the oil and brakes of a car too. I can do three things that a lot of women can't do.
8338 2018-04-11 11:19:53 You do see some cast iron gas boilers doing 30+ years.. 
the heavy oil equivalent even longer...
8339 2018-04-11 11:19:49 PERSPECTIVE:

Last year, USA exported 69 million barrels of crude oil during Q1 and 356 million in total.

For Q1 of this year, that number is already up at 139 million. Where will it be by end of the year?

8347 2018-04-11 11:18:48 Very key areas mind you. They’re very much on the Neo-Con wing when it comes to Syria conflict. A big stake in Genie Energy, a company that wants to extract oil from areas like Syrian Golan that is occupied by Israel. Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch board members. Lovely bunch
8348 2018-04-11 11:18:47 problem is if the leader of syria is gone...terrorists will take over and fill in vacum..

8352 2018-04-11 11:18:18 @IcelandFoods 
Am I correct in believing you will be palm oil in products you sell. If so that puts you above any other food retailers. Oh and I believe if they could the gorillas would say thank you. Not like humans have not made a mess of their Kingdom is it.
8353 2018-04-11 11:18:15 Pah! You’re lauding ‘13 points clear’ as an ‘achievement’? I’d say that’s moot given there’s still 6 games to play. Furthermore given City has been bankrolled by the oil regime and Pep brought in to deliver the CL, in that context I’d suggest it’s a MASSIVE underachievement!
8354 2018-04-11 11:18:09 We always check products we buy to make sure they dont contain palm oil.  If they do we find an alternative.
8355 2018-04-11 11:18:04 Oil station? Then there is surcharge for all cards of any banks , for few valued customers they absorb rest is pass on to the customer.

8368 2018-04-11 11:16:44 There is no oil drilling by the Maro Lago. Why is that. Everyone else's beach front in the US is going to be jam pack with  oil rigs.
They stopped bottled water to Flint. Opened hunting on hibernating animals.
8369 2018-04-11 11:16:38 The entire GOP, not just T***p, are awash in Russian oil company money and corruption.  The GOP isn't protecting T, they're protecting themselves. They don't have the distance from crime that the GOP had during Watergate.
8370 2018-04-11 11:16:36 We didn't take Iraqi oil and we're an energy independent nation now.
You can blame us for trying to lead with our values and making mistakes, but we've spent trillions in support of and rebuilding Iraq and have stolen nothing.

8375 2018-04-11 11:16:07 President Buhari does not hate any tribe in Nigeria. His government has just returned oil wells that originally belonged to Anambra back to them.

Anambra is not a northern state neither is it a Muslim dominated state.

8379 2018-04-11 11:15:06 For athlete's foot, reach for tea tree oil, an extract of the leaves of an Australian tree. It appears to have antiseptic properties and may work as well as or better than over-the-counter antifungal products. #Healthcare #GoMedii
8380 2018-04-11 11:15:04 tamanu oil actually hurts like a bitch if u get it in ur eye
8381 2018-04-11 11:15:03 Shipping is $17 to UK not really worth it and its slow.
Is there an antiseptic spray with 0.13% benzalkonium chloride in UK? Use that let it dry then dab on use tea tree oil about 3X-5x daily. Both together or separately should be good result. Good luck!

8384 2018-04-11 11:14:38 How stupid can the oil market be sometimes? Syria produces 30,000-ish bpd. That's nothing. There will be no war. The U.S. isn't going to fight Russia. Last year the idiots who made oil rise after the bombing thankfully LOST their money badly #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F

8396 2018-04-11 11:13:03 the main factor that caused forests have been cutted is because my nation is still can’t handle illegal logging properly. And the land that abandoned has been used to grow a palm oil. So maybe not all the problem was caused by palm oil

8399 2018-04-11 11:12:43 No, Britain (mainly England & Wales) need ACTION, not more pie in the sky targets & goals. Block all new oil & gas (#Fracking) exploration & exploitation, stop the importation of #ethane for plastics and chemicals. Close coal power stations and make buildings energy-neutral. 
8400 2018-04-11 11:12:32 He is right on this and Assad is a f monster! Why he has not been arrested for war crimes is beyond d belief! But bombing only harms more civilians! Just take Assad out! They too S#Saddam out fast enough when oil was involved!

It is written and cannot be changed.  It's happening just like a script that Russia, Iran are reading.

8414 2018-04-11 11:09:59 In case you ask in Syria there's not much crude oil if any, so disruptions are negligible and CL_F reaction is more speculative-er than else.

8477 2018-04-11 11:00:48 CT revenues should be treated as if we had found oil. Norway put their oil revenues into a savings fund, knowing that they would run out of oil one day. The U.K. spent their oil revenues.  Which model would you rather prefer?

8484 2018-04-11 11:00:01 Just been reading up a bit on all the stuff with Cohen. Are you seriously telling me he worked out of the offices of Squire Patton Boggs? The lawyers of Cambridge Analytica? Who also act as lobbyists for Russian oil firm Gazprom?
8485 2018-04-11 10:59:56 Ontariowe is $325B in the hole and its budget still has structural deficit.  You are right, the equalization formula should be reviewed to ensure anti oil jurisdictions do not benefit from that windfall until they're in compliance of their Constitutional commitments.
8486 2018-04-11 10:59:36 And my account in the hole Italian dish is Neapolitan Style Pizza with the fat puffy crust with nice bread stranding. The fresh olive oil just mixing in with that freshly melted and browned mozzarella cheese & basil leaves.  I got real Italian Chefs to teach me for free
8487 2018-04-11 10:59:33 It's not a silly point but you seem to be ignoring the fact that palm farming uses/destroys tropical rainforest habitats, whereas sunflowers and other 'oil' plants will grow in temperate regions without long-term harm to the environment.
8488 2018-04-11 10:59:26 Iceland foods is relatively small cf other store chains but at least it is making people think about Palm oil and sourcing. Doubt others will boycott as use so entrenched but it may kick off more thoughtful approach wrt consumer demand/ boycott
8489 2018-04-11 10:58:52 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

8544 2018-04-11 10:50:53 And why are you even talking about imports? The salient issue is the export of the single commodity upon which the South's entire economy was based. Cotton.

8607 2018-04-11 10:40:06 it's so fucking hot but i'm not sweating at all .................. my face is producing so much oil
8608 2018-04-11 10:39:58 Well done Iceland Food stores for banning palm oil in some of their own brand food stores. Experts say that it will only shift production to another type of oil. I say they will raise awareness. Demand for the oil will drop. Good for wildlife !!
8609 2018-04-11 10:39:48 Oil reached a near 3 year peak ($71.34 a barrel) buoyed by political tension in the Middle East, despite evidence of rising US crude supply acted as a counterbalance. #oilprices #SyriaStrike @i24NEWS_EN
8610 2018-04-11 10:39:44 Then you need to get out more. Trump has made NATO, NoKo and China back down, he’s reduced taxes, encouraged job growth, revitalized coal, increased oil production,deported criminals, etc.

Oil held near its highest in nearly three years on Wednesday, supported by political tension in the Middle East, although evidence of rising U.S. crude supply acted as a counterbalance.

8625 2018-04-11 10:38:00 Spent hours under my truck last night replacing a starter and attempting to change the oil. Well the bolt was so jacked I couldn’t get it off, and this morning when talking to my boss, he said worse case, weld something to it! Hahaha I’m glad I have this job.
8626 2018-04-11 10:37:55 Oh it was a very long time ago. I was 12. He was pretty cool. You'd have liked him. Worked on oil rigs, flew a helicopter, rode and raced motorcycles, listened to old school rock 'n roll. BUT....don't hold it against him....*whispers* He was from Lancashire!!!! #TheEnemy

8628 2018-04-11 10:37:40 HOW WONDERFUL that Iceland Foods have taken the initiative and have started to ban palm oil from some of its food items. I will definitely be shopping with them . I find it extremely difficult to buy foods that are free from the oil.. Good Iceland. Well done

8704 2018-04-11 10:24:11 Everytime we export goods (mostly oil), the CBN gives the money to Govt. in Naira while it keeps the dollars. When a manufacturer wants to import raw materials he/she pays Naira to CBN & gets some of that Dollar. The balance of dollar inflows & outflows forms the Foreign Reserve.

8764 2018-04-11 10:15:49 It's not the government business to import black oil and allocate it to refiners, and control finances under the garb of balance of payments.
8765 2018-04-11 10:15:34 That's mistaking the effect of an oil boom with good governance. The bad governance of the period ensured that it all disappeared within a decade: swallowed by greedy politicians and wasteful officials. Other countries that have oil AND good governance are still doing fine.
8766 2018-04-11 10:15:12 Why are you talking like you legitimately made a world class team like United, Bayern, Barca and Real. You just got oil money and bought players. You didn't play for years at end and win the league to get money for good players. And yet you still cant win the treble

Ugh...
8829 2018-04-11 10:06:17 Think it is more than just oil - they want to keep Syria a failed state. Why? Probably because of Assad's opposition to central bank, it leads to more migrants & it keeps an opponent of Israel weak.

9120 2018-04-11 09:22:30 It’s a valid challenge too, given the need 4 high yield food sources to help address the ever growing human population. Alas, Palm Oil plantations create vast biodiversity deserts in once rich environments, let alone displacement of wildlife & the burning of forest for clearance.

9277 2018-04-11 08:58:49 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.

9288 2018-04-11 08:56:34  #Crude prices soared more than 3% yesterday on the back of what appeared to be geopolitical concerns. Market participants seem concerned that the conflict in Syria may escalate and therefore have pushed oil prices higher.
9289 2018-04-11 08:55:27 LOL. That was one of Rockefeller's arguments too. Break up Standard and the European oil companies will take over. But, he was wrong: Standard Oil was broken up in 1911. The US is a world unto itself. Never forget that.
9290 2018-04-11 08:55:25 Finally had my car oil changed. It hasn’t been changed since I bought the car two years ago.
9291 2018-04-11 08:55:02 Trudeau climate plan allows Alberta to expand oil & gas emissions but taxes economic growth in the rest of Canada, an odd notion of “National”interest.
While it might ultimately benefit us by reducing our ff dependency, ironically it only delays that inevitable outcome in AB.
9292 2018-04-11 08:54:59 Thai energy companies are on a roll. The national oil and gas champion, a coal miner and power utility, upstart solar and wind companies, virtually all are expanding across Southeast Asia, applying practices and technology developed at home.
9293 2018-04-11 08:54:43 The oil forecast was so wild the last time no one will even entertain the next forecast. And it will need to be more than just loved brands to make a clear economic plan to sway voters
9294 2018-04-11 08:54:31 Oil light came on on my car, this is bad, this is very bad  I always have problems with oil, why me!
9295 2018-04-11 08:54:27 It's time to think about oil. Crude prices are at a 3yr high of $71 amid possible missile strike on Syria. HIBISCUS-WC remains the best warrant pick. #trade #finance #saham #klci
9296 2018-04-11 08:54:16 150 TNCs control the system. And before tens of trillions in dollars and tailored policies were given as bank bailouts, Eric Holder was visited by some titled Londoners who advised him on US jurisdiction versus Int'l Bank of Settlements. Snake oil salesman created the US emperor?

9300 2018-04-11 08:53:05 No war on Syria to please the oil and land grabbing thieves. Britain is not stealing land and oil from Syria. This is not a British fight.
9301 2018-04-11 08:53:04 The uptick in global economy, the lower crude prices have till now aided #NarendraModi in terms of keeping certain aspects of economy in check and amassing taxes from oil. With #crudeoil now touching 70$ it would be interesting to see how he fares in the rest of his term.

9304 2018-04-11 08:52:24 Meanwhile India is chuntering about need for $50/bbl oil & IMHO entire purpose of Shanghai buy-side contract (backed by 1bn bbl of China oil inventory) is just that. Organisation of Petroleum Importing Countries (OPIC) here we come? #OOTT
9305 2018-04-11 08:52:20 #Crude palm oil prices eased further 0.25 per cent to Rs 644.50 per 10 kg in futures market today as speculators engaged in reducing their positions, taking negative cues from spot market on muted demand
9306 2018-04-11 08:52:17 Without taking down Syria by USA the long term plan to run pipelines with “free” oil and gas from ME to Europe and Asia will not work. The $21trillions military investment in neo-colonialism is becoming very painful deficit!

9339 2018-04-11 08:48:03 It always makes me laugh that coal, oil and gas are treated as non-renewable energy sources. They are renewable but over a longer period. Wind, solar and tide energy is instantaneous harvesting not renewable.

9563 2018-04-11 08:09:24 If you live in a palm oil area I'm sure sustainable palm oil is a good local option. Here it's still far too difficult to find. But the debate is good, awareness raising is good and consumer pressure to stop any further forest clearance is vital either way.

Govt has clearly presented how savings from oil import helped it invest more in infra... Inflation is well within control so higher fuel price not impacting common man...

9709 2018-04-11 07:43:30 The other day my GP was like "well maybe if you just /try/ FODMAP it will help with MCAS"

But FODMAP = no onions

And like, 95% of my cooking starts with onions and oil

So I would have to relearn how to cook, but also with brain fog and no guaranteed pay off
9710 2018-04-11 07:43:20 Joshua, you speak as if climate change wasn’t a thing. Yes oil etc have been very useful, but long term it turns out that they are extremely damaging. Like cocaine was apparently good for making you alert and energetic, but then turned out that long term it’s addictive and kills.

9720 2018-04-11 07:41:11 Making a batch of sugarfree peanut butter (peanuts, olive oil & Himalayan salt only). Who wants in? 
9721 2018-04-11 07:41:01 Oil prices hurt every section of society and impact the supply chain. It's probably the most non-equitable way to collect revenue. There is little correlation between rise in income and increase in fuel consumption
9722 2018-04-11 07:40:52 I think you’ll find palm oil isn’t prolific because of vegans...I’d love to think we had that power!  It’s because it’s cheap...sadly people love cheap and usually don’t think of the hidden costs to the environment, people, biodiversity or animal welfare. 
Well done Iceland.

9725 2018-04-11 07:40:27 Hi, thanks for your question. The replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.

Nothing makes me.laugh harder then people whos entire lives are built around oil based products complaining about where oil comes from.

9731 2018-04-11 07:38:57 Please think logically. Syria would not use gas. They win nothing to do this. Israel and Cheney are stealing oil in Syria they win if US stays in war. That simple.
9732 2018-04-11 07:38:09 It is actually the opposite @justintrudeau  is the one who desperately needs to save face - he lied to BC voters before 2015 election! Oil / gas worth less than 5% of Canada's GDP. Is #kindermorgan 's corporate interests worth his majority government? #cdnpoli #stopkm
9733 2018-04-11 07:37:54 @realDonaldTrump what benefit would we get? Just some rich corporation getting the oil. There has been better technology since the 50's. Show Americans proof. Real proof not speculations. Kinda like Osama Bin Laden no pictures no body... right.. he is still alive.
9734 2018-04-11 07:37:45 BREAKING: Houthi militia have announced they have hit a facility belonging to the Saudi Aramco oil company in Jizan province, southern #Saudi Arabia with the Qasif 1 drone.
9735 2018-04-11 07:36:55 This has sparked a lot of debate with plenty of tropical.ecologists and experts weighing in to say that we should be supporting sustainable palm oil because it's a highly efficient crop - boycotting it will make problem worse according to many
9736 2018-04-11 07:36:44 Hi Rhona. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks

9740 2018-04-11 07:36:00 Do you make it with olive oil rather than butter to make it healthier?

9749 2018-04-11 07:34:57 Pruitt hasn't received death threats. Did you make that up, or did he?? His "bold actions" are helping gas & oil, while creating more harm to our air, water, food, & health. Barron will have to live with the things you've destroyed.
9750 2018-04-11 07:34:40 Saudi's are also artificially propping up the price of oil to $80/bbl and hurting Indian consumers. Why are we signing a deal with @Saudi_Aramco on the refinery? Saudi Arabia has a history of abusing Indian workers in Riyadh, and the latest case of Indian workers held in Dammam

9961 2018-04-11 06:59:59 @sunrisedailynow Muhammadu Buhari should take responsibility for the crash of the Nigerian economy. His action which saw critical ministries like Finance, Power, Oil operate for 6 months without leadership was a deliberate action in the day of reckoning is here
9962 2018-04-11 06:59:55 What about the billions of gallons of toxins that are in the paint? Did they but the expensive biodegradable paint that will wash off and be wasted? Or did they simply color the raid with enough toxins to poison the air and kill off more nature then an oil spill? Libtards

9970 2018-04-11 06:58:32 The price of a cheap oil addiction ... A price i'm not willing to pay.
9971 2018-04-11 06:58:27 Interesting that saturated fats have remained constant. Maybe the LCHF camp should rebrand to LCLVO (Low Carb/Low Vegetable Oil). This would be more productive to the education campaign.
9972 2018-04-11 06:58:25 Add a little water to dampen your beard before applying beard oil. It helps to lock in more moisture than beard oil on its own. Also allows you to tame it more easily

9975 2018-04-11 06:57:19 I agree it would be nutso to put a new oil terminal in Fraser River delta but Burrard Inlet and Roberts Bank have proven to be fine for such purposes (moving hydrocarbons around), and the added number of overall ship movements would not leap, merely grow a bit (not a bad thing).

His wife @LucyTurnbullGSC is busy with her Greater Sydney Commission pet project: an 8 million Sydney, to please developers. Next oil crisis will stop it. Be patient and watch it coming
9978 2018-04-11 06:56:52 Look up NUTRITARIAN on YouTube, there’s no oil, dairy or meat and the recipes are amazing. If you want the reason it’s so great the book is #EatToLive by #DrFuhrman. I’m really enjoying it, despite the fact I was a huge meat eater.

9980 2018-04-11 06:56:46 Clearly more of a rockstar than me then. I need to sell off my guitars & buy some of that snake oil
9981 2018-04-11 06:56:45 Should have saved your oil royalties and invested it like Norway. You probably would have had a $1 trillion dollar+ fund by now. I feel be for every day Albertans. The politicians have fooled them.

9989 2018-04-11 06:55:33 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
9990 2018-04-11 06:55:31 Oil is staying down cause only place can get raw product to is US, who buys it at discounted rate. PM inaction on pipeline is contributing

9992 2018-04-11 06:55:00 Believe me i am a proffesional. 80% of syrian christians support assad, more over libanese and jordanian christians too.

As far as pointing the fingers to buying oil. Well turkey your nato allie did it with clear evidence. Why don’t you send a few cruise missiles towards them?
9993 2018-04-11 06:54:56 I’ve made this comparison myself. People worry about plane crashes, but not far more probable car crashes. People worry about radiation from nuclear power, but not far more common health effects from oil and gas generation.
9994 2018-04-11 06:54:48 Oil price drop, means other country is selling their oil, so APC should b encouraging production not complaining, lazy party
9995 2018-04-11 06:54:45 That's not true! Never before in the history of mankind have wars been waged over oil, energy or raw materials.   Follow the tracks of money, and see who has an advantage and when.  Then you know where and who the real psychopaths are  on this beautiful planet. 
9996 2018-04-11 06:54:39 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9997 2018-04-11 06:54:21 Even Carlson didn't mention the 50 billion tons of Syrian shale oil reserves, which is what the "civil war" there is really about.
9998 2018-04-11 06:53:59 Why won't the oil be given to Anambra State? Kogi State is the most unfortunate state in Nigeria.

10000 2018-04-11 06:53:51 Not sure what Saudi gas has to do w/ the #TransMountain pipleine? I don't oppose pipelines or the development, processing & sale of Canadian oil, especially if sold here, but this is about exporting a raw, unprocessed resource overseas in a way that endangers our economy
