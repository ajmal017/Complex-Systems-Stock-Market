38 2018-06-20 22:05:37 The demand for gold has declined because many more useful commodities exist on exchanges today.
Markets stabilized when we went off the gold standard cuz commies used gold to anonymously campaign in cappies markets (before bearer bonds and anonymously centralized “crypto)
39 2018-06-20 21:56:50 When will people stop being viewed as commodities and start being people again? The world is a whisper from reintroducing slavery and segregation. Please let's stop it now!
40 2018-06-20 21:51:42 That is actually a real asset the UK can "trade" on post Brexit. Lots of specialized knowledge and hi tech.  If normal tradeable commodities do not exist side deals regarding security could be enticing to future trading partners.

42 2018-06-20 21:48:43 Le acabo de dar 2 razones por las cuales no se puede interpretar toda la caida en participacion industria/PIB como desindustrialización.

51 2018-06-20 21:05:21 To go back to the beginning, I think Naomi was trying to point out that the Euro spending/purchasing power seems to have a significant differentiation, in relation to commodities purchasing power in different EU countries...

1) energy

Particularly energy is big restaint.
54 2018-06-20 20:55:28 It’s a low value commodity with a huge differentiation... Maybe it doesn’t translate to other commodities....

56 2018-06-20 20:46:22 How much storage and transport of commodities is related to pricing, hedging, trading etc compared to storage and transport that is used for consumption or production?

How much storage would we need in total with perfect knowledge of inventory/use? 

Much less?

58 2018-06-20 20:36:42 Japan tries to block currencies with crypto elements, but meanwhile continues to issue virtual currency exchange license. So, I think, they will support virtual currencies backed by commodities.
59 2018-06-20 20:35:23 because they're not bloody orphans for a start!  Nor are they commodities
60 2018-06-20 20:33:33 The original sin of American immigration policy is treating immigrants as commodities, either a +1 or -1 to our collective national value. Until we start treating each person as just that — a person — we will continue to get it irredeemably wrong.
61 2018-06-20 20:32:29 On the real, once they’re here, most illegal immigrants take care of us “natives.” Think about it — they often work with fake docs so they social security but never draw from the fund, and they work for dirt cheap at grueling jobs, which keeps commodities affordable.
62 2018-06-20 20:32:28 Oh my gosh, the Shady Commodities theme is just the Amazing Commodities theme but in minor
63 2018-06-20 20:29:02 PMB look more healthy than 2015 but hike in price of foods commodities and low income for public servant.
64 2018-06-20 20:19:20 Pharma is overlapping - infesting - all areas.
We are either commodities or guinea pigs.
Both.

I heard pharmacies have to fill quotas, if the pharmacist doesn't meet it, he/she is fired. 
More prone to error.

66 2018-06-20 20:13:54 The VP of sales for a Fortune 500 company will be staying at my house this weekend.

96 2018-06-20 17:52:18 @Manisha3005  Manisha it's really quite sad that when you provide strategy calls from angel commodities, I'm guessing you take a cut out of it ,  Ng  call and silver call it's horrible no way close . I guess it's a strategy from CNBC TV  18

110 2018-06-20 17:01:39 It is going up because of these signs. The recent market rally does have to do with profits of companies. Have you noticed prices have gone up on most commodities? While higher earnings are better, the rate of inflation also grows causing prices to rise with profits rising.
111 2018-06-20 16:56:03 Of course it is. There are also older kids in work camps in Ohio.
Only a knuckle-dragging idiot would be capable of being an ICE agent. Stupidity is necessary for cruelty. 
They are able to compartmentalize people&view them as commodities. Trump wants to trade babies for a wall.

119 2018-06-20 16:31:40 IMO need to put finer point on it: CNY skyrocketing in commodity terms is something China desires; CNY skyrocketing in terms of competing currencies, not so much.  Only way to balance the 2 is to use a neutral settlemt asset at a ratio to commodities attractive to comm exporters

127 2018-06-20 16:21:58 Yes, according to the current dogmas brought by the vilest ideology ever perpetrated in humankind.

Its name is Neoliberalism.

It’s always about ‘the cost’.

Neoliberals are pure psychopaths.

They don’t give a shit about anything but $.

Human lives are nothing but commodities.
128 2018-06-20 16:18:37 They’re continuing to profit off people’s lives, we are commodities to them. Whether it’s healthcare, private prisons, detention centers, guns etc
We are all walking around with price tags on our heads

130 2018-06-20 16:07:26 Pres George Weah, make food commodities duty free. Increases import, & lowers prices for the poor people. Times are hard.
131 2018-06-20 15:54:26 I also have concerns about how the US Dollar is backed. Not ideal but it's supported against governments, commodities, and economies with a longer record. So you'd place all your trust in a company that failed disclose their ties to Tether and general lack of transparency?
132 2018-06-20 15:51:12 Some suggest this drop is an excellent opportunity to cover mill needs for 2018, 2019, 2020.  I hope today’s rally, to borrow a grain expression, is “not a dead cat bounce”. Cotton probably has a better chance to rally than several other commodities

145 2018-06-20 15:17:45 It's easier to call names and fake outrage. When they realize the elites use these kids as commodities, then the real outrage will happen.
146 2018-06-20 15:15:16 Should be obvious at this point. The fact they want to suppress #commodities, especially #CrudeOil, shows the desperate attempt to hold back #inflation. They fear the consequences it would have on the everything bubble. Wage growth anemic and if #Inflation soars, ponzi is over.
147 2018-06-20 15:13:43 Remember this old adage?
"If America sneezes, the world catches a cold."
Commodities are priced in USD
Australia exports commodities
Yet Oz mining costs are in AUD
So, high AUD hurts miners, who get paid in USD but pay expenses in AUD
Can't blame America for that one.
148 2018-06-20 15:11:59 If all the marvel properties are under one roof and known to be Disney commodities, then it becomes increasingly “odd” for universal to have them in their parks in my opinion, on top of the leverage they would hold with Simpson’s rights given they are in UA parks.

Only a politician economic analyst would be blind to the fact that all economic indices indicate a revived economy.
Inflation and high prices of commodities, is part of a growing economy, it has nothing to do with recession or bad economy.
195 2018-06-20 10:31:05 Keeping highly perishable commodities in good condition during transportation to their destination has always been a  challenge.
196 2018-06-20 10:12:21 As I said.. COMMODITY Currency. All commodities.  Canada has investments in many commodity industries.  And as I said previously after the most recent crash with oil down to 26 bucks in 2016 it forced Cad to tighten its investments.   Maybe you should be aware of that too.
197 2018-06-20 10:11:11 O que aconteceu no Brasil com o boom das commodities foi o que aconteceu em outros países pobres no período. Na verdade, se a ação do governo fez algo foi atrapalhar o movimento natural, pois em uma serie de dimensões ficamos pra trás.

219 2018-06-20 07:57:31 Agreed but with diverse income revenues it alleviates the pressure to sell commodities for cash flow purposes helping you maximise the value of the primary commodity. UK farmers overheads are inherently higher than your own leading to pressure on cash flow.
220 2018-06-20 07:49:15 No it isnt. Let them go back to where they come from & the drug cartels will send them right back. They are just COMMODITIES to the drug dealers. Where the hell are their parents. It is they that are responsible not AMERICANS.

232 2018-06-20 06:18:30 Plus let's not disregard hostile foreign power. Former USSR's commodities richness helped them staff afloat. Their military would unlikely last mere days in direct combat but what they've got is psyops on large scale. It's been proven all over, US, UK, France, Germany...

234 2018-06-20 06:07:45 Cyclical nature of commodities suggest that should change and resources should make a new high over the next decade, with resource stocks attracting significant capital flows and potential the AUD hitting $2 against USD. Big things will happen...
235 2018-06-20 06:06:20 @hidflect that’s because commodities are trading at an all time low compared to S&P500 index. True story. Capital flows have also abandoned mining stocks completely, which has seen #ASX market in lacklustre stare for years. But....

238 2018-06-20 05:52:16 Don’t invest in stocks, real estate or bitcoin, or commodities if you have not first invested in yourself. Your mind is the engine that drives your growth. If it is not well developed, it will be led by greed and you will make unwise investments and lose your money #RenosNuggets
239 2018-06-20 05:25:37 "by doing research" you can certainly learn and understand women better by knowing them, listening etc. but that is very different from BECOMING a woman.

the world for women is just different, it's life as a beta carnivore carrying around sexual commodities the alphas all want.
240 2018-06-20 05:19:37 Funny you say that, I covered my short yesterday. Never ceases to amaze the % moves lower commodities can go. All of them,  cocoa, coffee, beans, ng. Relentless. 3% per day is normal.

245 2018-06-20 04:36:42 palm oil price really crashing. odd when other commodities have risen so much and ringgit weakening
246 2018-06-20 04:34:27 2/ It also compares favourably to the currencies and commodities that bitcoin could help replace: Global production of cash and coins consumes an estimated 11 terawatt-hours per year, while gold mining burns the equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours.
247 2018-06-20 04:31:39 Nope.  Inflation is the Feds select elements they choose for the inflation index components. Aaand, a coincidence..? ( I think not ) those components (sectors/commodities) are targeted for their lowest inflated value.  It's a grand illusion to use in manipulating public opinion.
248 2018-06-20 04:26:56 It is1/2 question. Reframe question as- on what front Modi govt.failed
1) employment
2) high price of commodities i.e. diesel
3) foreign policy, more tour 
4) demonetisation
5) institution failure
6) farmer & dalit condition @narendramodi @RahulGandhi @divyaspandana @vidyarthee
249 2018-06-20 04:13:42 As an Administrative Scientist I see this as a solution to Reunifying Families separated at the Border. We can track commodities back for Recalls, since these people have been commodified we can track them for reunification.

253 2018-06-20 03:53:57 Get outta commodities and get into online finance...  PAYX, SQ, FDC, other, or AAXN, AMD, ETSY, whatever, its an easier trade, JMHO...  GOod luck, heck buy some tankers, NAT, FRO, DHT, TNK, EURN...  Again good luck.
254 2018-06-20 03:53:39 Commodities and goods move with people. For a border area to have democratic self determination (especially in tax use and trade policies). Doesn’t there have to be a distinction in area. So one border town determines their values and the other their own?
255 2018-06-20 03:50:32 really not as concerned about the free movement of goods as i am about the free movement of people. i worry more about toddlers than commodities. more of a from each to each kind of guy, i think that comes across
256 2018-06-20 03:45:30 If the US stock market declines 10%, and US Ag commodities decline 20%, already soybean prices are at 10 year low, and this border policy continues, Trump and the republicans are fucked!
257 2018-06-20 03:43:40 I disagree!!! Anyone can’t make the best shoe and make it fit the best. Innovation and style are very rare commodities in this game.
258 2018-06-20 03:41:31 @yogrishiramdev : sir..Please start schools across India as these corporate schools are looting common people. You bought a revolution to regular commodities..!!
259 2018-06-20 03:40:23 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa

I'd stick to index funds with maybe a little bonds/crypto/commodities

265 2018-06-20 02:56:33 Dear @arunjaitley do you really proud of what you have did? Imposing High taxes on basic commodities and collecting huge fines from all possible ways will definitely put India in top position. But fact is it actually breaks backbone of every individual
266 2018-06-20 02:56:29 Welcome to the US:
Where frivolous lawsuits are abundant.
This woman is to blame for being separated from her kid....if it's even her kid.
Kids are hot commodities to those who think they will grant them a free pass!
They are also highly sought after for sex trafficking!
267 2018-06-20 02:52:32 It's gotten to that point 
Democratic commodities these children r 
Democrats actually exploiting the very people they profess 2 care 4 .
Grasping 4 the concept that these children r more deserving of care than a late term fetus being ripped from a womb . The logic escapes me
268 2018-06-20 02:52:28 And @ivanka is Serena...The Trump CULT have their commander and their army @GOP. In the Trump cult children and women are commodities.

271 2018-06-20 02:23:56 PS: Most if not all children detained are "trafficked;" shepherded as "commodities" through the arduous trek by "Coyotes' Cartel." Children who make it to the US Southern Border & held in custody are lucky they did not fall prey to drug, gangs & sex human traffickers.
272 2018-06-20 02:23:27 If China "blinks" regarding tariffs, stocks will explode.  In addition, we'll know why silver was moving higher last week... before this week's crash.  There is a lot of inside information influencing stocks and commodities in the line of fire from Trump's tariff iinitiatives.
273 2018-06-20 02:18:44 China demand for American agricultural commodities has been hugely positive to American farmers.....
274 2018-06-20 02:14:29 @PMOIndia - what's action against all private body.  In school they charge what they want.  In hospital they charge unnecessarily high charges and in private job no increments for years and you keep on increasing your commodities rate. What to do, 

Bade armaan se Bjp ko vote diy
275 2018-06-20 02:12:35 And with the withdrawl from the UN Human Rights Council, @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP march us closer to an authoritarian, fascist world where the masses are expendable commodities. To step away from the dicussion, problems on the committe or no, is a dereliction.
276 2018-06-20 02:12:23 The American Wealthy Elite, & their mindless sycophants want to turn Freedom, & Democracy n2 distinct commodities like cable tv, for example.  They want to determine the cost, who gets it, & how much of it we can have at any given time.

281 2018-06-20 01:41:39 My daughter was a Resident in Buffalo New York for a year and moved back to the Ontario to practice . We were amazed the price of a cheese and chicken was so cheap compared to Canada. It was a joke the number of people that crossed the border to buy these commodities.
282 2018-06-20 01:40:53 It is in the @GOP platform that human life begins gametes fuse and ends when the placenta detaches.  In tRumplandia, corporations are people, and people...are commodities, carbon receptacles, consumers, coal shovelers, clean air moochers, suspects, “infestations”.
283 2018-06-20 01:40:44 When you allow fair trials, legality, and policing to become commodities, you ensure every poor person is a criminal and every rich one is exonerated.
284 2018-06-20 01:39:42 No.  You don't care about kids.  You leftists have turned these kids into commodities.  If having a kid in tow and saying "asylum" gets you a free illegal pass into US, poor families start selling their kids tomorrow.

294 2018-06-20 00:18:45 Exchange value is a social relation which is prescribed in commodity value valorizes within exchange first and foremost, that means the only thing which is visible within the stage of production is the exchange of labour power for money, thats fetishism within the commodities.
