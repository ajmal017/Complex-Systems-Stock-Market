40 2018-04-11 23:45:27 Here's a couple of range where those individual stocks could close Friday, just for curiosity:
I expect them to bounce in the lower area and finish higher on Friday, just to piss off shorts. I could be totally wrong however. News out there are hot.
AAPL: 170-175
AMZN: 1420 -1450
41 2018-04-11 23:44:17 Speaker John Boehner has inhaled the smoke from his Rastafarian son-in-law and joined the board of a #marijuana company. Time to take advantage of pullback in pot stocks and pick up shares.

69 2018-04-11 23:15:14 We must remove irrational restrictions on the ATF.

83 2018-04-11 23:07:38 Sad, their business will suffer and so will customers who use their bank for business. When banks make decisions like this it hurts all customers,meaning it will hurt individuals, stocks and expansion into other businesses. Working people will hurt also in many ways.
84 2018-04-11 23:07:28 Bump Stocks enable a semiautomatic AR-15 style assault weapon to perform virtually as an automatic rifle. Aside from that, AR-15 style rifle bullets, without bump stocks, are capable of traveling nearly 3 times faster than those of a handgun. AR-15s come with 30 round magazines.

98 2018-04-11 22:55:04 I want to ban semi-automatic guns, bump stocks, and have stricter laws on being able to buy guns, who can buy them, how easy it is to get them.

Konami sucks and their games are selling poorly so their stocks go down, to the point where they need to file for bankruptcy. And Death Stranding sells so well that KJP would be capable of buying out Konami and its properties thus regaining Metal Gear
102 2018-04-11 22:51:27 The best portfolio is a diverse portfolio, having a mix of income generating stocks that pay dividends and bonds that give coupon payments while reserving a small percentage of your account for active trading is a good way to keep your account balanced and profitable.

107 2018-04-11 22:43:51 And therefore people who claim a the Syrian stocks were destroyed by the Americans are talking bollox.
108 2018-04-11 22:42:32 No. No, it does not. We need roads, rail roads, schools funded and our @gop gave trillions in tax breaks to companies who are now using that "create jobs" money to buy back stocks.
109 2018-04-11 22:41:53 Increasing price of stocks doesn’t grow the company - the very fact there are buybacks means that money is NOT being invested in R&D! The corporate #TaxReform has resulted in one-time bonuses, higher executive pay and stock buybacks - none of which grow the company. Basic math!

166 2018-04-11 22:01:07 His meme was depicting me as anti gun.  I am not.  At the same time, if you can't own an RPG without jumping through serious hoops, you shouldn't be able to own tactical semi-autos with hundred round drums and bump stocks without similar hoops.

185 2018-04-11 21:45:14 The physical transaction is money, for the stocks. Identical to buying a piece of real estate or anything else. You were talking about accounting, that's how it is accounted for.

189 2018-04-11 21:41:51 Stocks have been trading tgrough record highs which means 1 of 2 things will happen 

Eg

Markets will continue to break records to levels we have never seen 

Or 

The markets will start to decline in price either slowly or rapidly 

Which is why some investors buy gold stocks

224 2018-04-11 21:21:43 It's nice to see a day where we don't have wild 5-10% swings in the #potstocks world regardless if they're red or green. These stocks need to calm down for a bit so we can consolidate and form new bases. I would like to see things stay static for a bit moving only 1-2%

236 2018-04-11 21:11:01 $Stocks  Was reminded today via the market that increased daily volatility in price requires smaller position sizes and a willingness to let them wiggle a bit more than just a few months ago.

275 2018-04-11 20:55:28 There are other stocks I would have bailed on a long time ago but the upside with $ANDI is worth rolling the dice on. They have delivered on what they have promised every time to this point. Call me crazy but I am hanging in!
276 2018-04-11 20:55:03 because stocks don't usually maintain AH pops of 18% or because you think $BLCM is worth less?

284 2018-04-11 20:48:28 I think $SRPT looks technically strong. My argument is based on the fact that despite the softer markets of late, the stock has held up relatively well. Suggesting institutional buying on dips. #trading #stocks

290 2018-04-11 20:42:38 The hilarious part was that magazine manufacturers were flying in caseloads of high capacity magazines and giving them away at the State Capitol. To be fair, the state should have to buy back the bump stocks at original value. I suspect someone will sue.

320 2018-04-11 20:25:00 World stocks mostly lower: US & Europe -.6%. Selling after yesterday's gains along with Syria & inflation unease likely causes. 1Q earnings start flowing Friday & should mitigate unease somewhat. Volatility will not abate for some time. "Normal" will be 1-2% almost daily moves.
321 2018-04-11 20:24:39 The fishing industry "died" ages ago when we sold all the rights to the Spanish fleets. Ironically, the EU policies have helped the fish stocks recover, otherwise we would have nothing left.

327 2018-04-11 20:20:33 Yep, it will work in beverages about as well as skim milk might, as they have comparable textures. It won't feather and will foam when steamed, just not quite as well as the Barista. Our Original oatmilk is a good middle ground, if your supermarket stocks it.
328 2018-04-11 20:19:03 Agreed.. People are lazy and just want to be told what to do. Just like stocks, they'll ask which one do I buy? - Idk, do some friggin research! - - I'm also long term ;)

332 2018-04-11 20:17:49 The fish stocks were dwindling rapidly because we were overfishing. Things aren't perfect now but they're a lot closer to sustainable.

348 2018-04-11 20:07:32 I'm not picking one side (stocks or real estate or currencies or mattress) over another. We can all cherry pick hindsight examples. I also don't think it's a good idea to overweight on real estate. All I'm saying is "pundits" can be - and are often - wrong. Both sides.
349 2018-04-11 20:07:03 Oh no!!! Disaster. I don't suppose you'd be able to check if any of the store in Scotland's central belt (Glasgow, Edinburgh and surrounding areas) have any stocks left? Ideally I'll wean them off it gradually.

359 2018-04-11 20:00:52 How management communicates mistakes is very important.

393 2018-04-11 19:42:25 Coming from the OTC (penny stocks)...you tend to spot "shitcoins" as they're called. High supply coins absorbed mostly by whales who flip for 10% easy...push it up only to cash out, then push it back down. Whales like that keep prices suppressed.

403 2018-04-11 19:38:09 @TuckerCarlson is spot on. I don't need to see young Americans die in an absurd and unjustified war so that Bill Kristol can make money on his defense stocks.
404 2018-04-11 19:37:28 Me being a black woman, it’s very sad to see 2 women of color make such fools out of themselves, supporting a president who doesn’t support them. You look ignorant, and you are just laughing stocks seriously
405 2018-04-11 19:36:10 "refusing additional housing" is something I wouldn't even try to define. I would just apply a capital gains tax. We do it for everything else, like stocks and shares. We also tax savings account interest. As for 'large', I would define it as, idk, $50,000+. YMMV.

If you'd be disappointed for trailing the returns of the S&P 500 Index over the prior 30 years, because you decided to pick your own stocks, I'd suggest you put your money in index funds now. If not, continue to love the investing journey you're on.

418 2018-04-11 19:31:09 The mortgage market reacts to President Trump’s tweets - threatening to drop bombs over Syria and subsequent response to Russia’s threatened intervention. This is creating uncertainty - money moving out of stocks into the safety of bonds - benefiting mortgage rates.

467 2018-04-11 19:02:28 Compensating by stocks is to ensure employees take care of the company & also to decrease the chance of career change. But the stocks are being vested in a few yrs (e.g.: 3 yrs) so they'd  look after company's benefits not necessarily for a long run & may ignore long term risks.

3.  AR-15:  One trigger pull, one bullet
4.  Bump stocks are illegal on the AR-15 and gun manufactures ARE NOT responsible for criminals who illegally modify

656 2018-04-11 17:24:29 Funny how you think owners and investors are two separate groups when just 52% of Americans own any stock at all, and richest 10% own 84% of stocks. Also funny how the least intelligent resort to insults as a result of their own shortcomings.

687 2018-04-11 17:07:23 Yes, buying stocks in the 30's and late 60's produced over a decade of negative returns I believe.  I'm 100% invested but I think the logic of buying index funds at any price will be akin to housing always goes up.  Time will tell.

699 2018-04-11 17:00:57 I use 50% of my options trading proceeds to purchase high quality dividend growth stocks (dividend aristocrats; with a few exceptions) from my watch list.
Every month or every week as I make enough cash, I take 50% of that and invest into dividend stocks. This was always my dream
700 2018-04-11 17:00:36 I am just a pure value investor. I look for projects and stocks that have taken a beating but have a future upside. Once the word hits and mini hypes happen, I stay away until the dust settles. Keeps me from some large gains, also keeps me from losing over time.

717 2018-04-11 16:54:18 Well, I don't agree with that judge at all. I say anything that is a derivative of a military style weapon, smaller mag clips, and any modification equipment that could turn a rifle INTO an assault weapon, ie, bump stocks. Handguns and hunting rifles are a different animal.

723 2018-04-11 16:50:54 Plenty of cars and car modifications render a car not street legal.  This is a bad analogy.  Bumper stocks for instance should not be legal and I think most people agree with that. It’s a gun mod designed to turn a semi into essentially fully.  80-90% of people agree to ban it.
724 2018-04-11 16:50:37 I'll bite.... I'd argue that flavor is built through, patience, cooking technique, stocks with roasted bones, rouxs (if necessary), fresh herbs, acids and oils.

786 2018-04-11 16:27:09 Ive been arguing for a while now that if anything Democrats have been too measured in their requests for gun control, so I agree with you there.

If you start off with "ban bump stocks" you get walked back to "ban occasional advertisements for gun stocks in some districts"
787 2018-04-11 16:26:55 Yes, so you rewarded white men who owned prison and prison stocks by enacting/ supporting legislation that incarcerated millions for using and selling weed. Now you and your white friends would like to legally sell it to our communities..Too much apathy..

791 2018-04-11 16:25:13 What new laws, ban on bump stocks that was already in the work 21 year to buy, changing age did nothing for the mental health issues that plague mass shootings, its a minor bandaid on a major problem
792 2018-04-11 16:24:53 Stock buy back are great for American economy.  If you are like most Americans and have savings in 401K and stocks that benefit from buy backs.  Get your facts strait.

794 2018-04-11 16:23:59 Buy more bomb stocks .... they only go up up up!
795 2018-04-11 16:23:41 Understand, though, that most investors are wise to invest in stocks as part of a diversified strategy. My point wasn’t directed at their “volatility” but on the relevance of certain tail events such as sustained draw downs.

801 2018-04-11 16:21:59 Investors in Russian stocks shrugging off Trump/Syria tweet? Or as goes oil, so goes Russia? The $RSX ETF opened the day lower. Now up 1.3% though as crude spikes 2.4%.
802 2018-04-11 16:21:18 I had National Trust ‘veggie chilli’ (no bread) and a cup of tea. Nothing else yet because I can’t work out if eating stodge will make me feel better or worse.

804 2018-04-11 16:20:47 True yesterday was fairly asinine. The trouble is it seems that a lot of people seem to see these hearings as something like a public punishment. Like a modern equivalent of the stocks. They should get barristers to ask the questions.

810 2018-04-11 16:17:09 Then they are breaking the law.

Do you think that after Brexit we will not have any fishing quotas? That  they will be allowed to fish as much as they want? Because the reason  we have quotas is that we almost exterminated the fish stocks through  overfishing.

825 2018-04-11 16:10:18 I wouldn’t necessarily avoid stocks. There is surv bias. Also, the degree of market risk acceptable depends on one’s investment horizon and funding demands. Draw downs between peaks are much greater than people realize and could drive some investors to untenable circumstances.

1170 2018-04-11 14:24:03 re #4. it also matters if you continue to expect "retroactive" exemptions then you further erode future demand so if supply steady and demand down, then price down (or less tight stocks in future given same supply)

1177 2018-04-11 14:21:24 Respectfully, what's needed is better regulations, a ban on bump stocks and military type weapons. Anyone with mental illness or a criminal weapon should be denied the right to own a weapon. This should be consistent in ALL states. More guns or guns in schools aren't the answer.

1231 2018-04-11 13:58:48 That's why I own gold and silver rather than stocks. Gold is worth at least 20 times what it was worth in 1918, while the U.S. dollar is now worth about what a nickel could buy in 1918. Roosevelt and Nixon screwed us all out of trillions of dollars.

1299 2018-04-11 13:33:59 Stocks are already going down. Curious as to what it will look like by this afternoon.
1300 2018-04-11 13:33:59 9:32 AM : Stocks have started the day lower. The Dow is -175.58 at 24,232.42 and the S&P 500 is -14.12 at 2,642.75. Mortgage Bonds are +8bp at 102.44. via @mbsHighway
1301 2018-04-11 13:33:23 "We start by showing impacts on earnings, labor
supply and wage rates, and then turn to the underlying anatomy of these impacts by showing how occupation, firm, and sector choices by men and women respond to children." - no stocks from what I can tell.
1302 2018-04-11 13:33:21 whats so bad about stocks?
1303 2018-04-11 13:32:40 May Allah bless anybody holding stocks...as long as that bitch, Trump, has a Twitter account.
1304 2018-04-11 13:32:39 There went a sale of 1.6M sharesof $GE at the open #ohboy #trading #stocks
1305 2018-04-11 13:32:29 Crude is climbing and stocks are ready to lose over the the Trump's Tweet on Syria and Russia.
1306 2018-04-11 13:32:21 But our gold stocks stink, GDX in increases in US whilst ALL our gold stocks decreases go figure
1307 2018-04-11 13:31:46 Stocks plunging again due to Trump tweets! Already down 200 and heading south!
1308 2018-04-11 13:31:13 Crypto assets traded at less than 1 $ = new penny stocks market!
1309 2018-04-11 13:31:06 for Bulls $silver will raise, then #gold then stocks ! ha PM's
1310 2018-04-11 13:30:57 Probably should have... if I really wanted to get antagonistic I would have said those two sales make up for about 12% of the higher than expected Mar 1 quarterly stocks
1311 2018-04-11 13:30:19 I bet the stocks are literally booming today......no crash in site. Eh? And noone had to die either....

1315 2018-04-11 13:28:35 Fish Stocks won't work, they just swim through the holes....
1316 2018-04-11 13:28:28 Stock dropping fast. My question is, is this happening to all stocks?
1317 2018-04-11 13:28:22 $silver Silver is the first to fall, then gold stocks and then Gold ....
1318 2018-04-11 13:27:00 $USDRUB cannot come off despite this generic rebound in risk. Let's see what US stocks open does.
1319 2018-04-11 13:26:59 It's amazing at how many different people have different information about the same stocks. You can look on Yahoo, Zacks, and Nasdaq..and everyone single one will have numbers about the same company.
1320 2018-04-11 13:26:16 I have a feeling these podcasts are getting bland. It’s always “look here’s another succesful individual with the secrets to the universe”. I am more into podcasts that actually discuss individual stocks or give tangible info these days.
1321 2018-04-11 13:26:13 It's tough because you feel like you can "out-invest" your debt. E.g., invest in stocks + have liquidity for emergencies.

1327 2018-04-11 13:22:31 I'll rephrase ;)  Both are high growth stocks in the sweet spot.  $AMZN is priced for perfection, $GOOGL however has already been in the penalty box for last 12 months.  One of these stocks is not like the other.

1333 2018-04-11 13:19:43 Losses only offset gains. If you held onto your stocks at year end (when stocks were still rising rapidly), you have no gains to offset.

1349 2018-04-11 13:14:05 In regards to physical gold vs gold stocks, gold bullion is held as reserves and systemic insurance whereas gold mining stocks provide speculative levered exposure to the price of gold amplifying both gains and losses. Apples and oranges really.
1350 2018-04-11 13:12:07 Of course which is why I used the word “some” in my original statement this was one of the first clips I watched, NowthisPolitics has it and Zuckerberg agrees with him. He was more apologetic than defensive. His handling of the trial might just be why FB’s stocks went up
1351 2018-04-11 13:11:52 @jimcramer  Boy, you missed a big move on oil stocks recommending to stay away from fossil fuels.

1355 2018-04-11 13:08:59 Glad you agree Graeme. Have been watching it brew away for months. Just hope nothing bad happens politically to put a spanner in our gold stocks just as things look really good.
1356 2018-04-11 13:08:44 At least when you hold stocks in your investment account, it isn't confusing: You know full well that their value in "US dollars" is just a valuation. But for "dollars" in your bank account, it isn't apparent.
1357 2018-04-11 13:08:16 You mean a blind trust doesn’t mean a blind person picks stocks?

1359 2018-04-11 13:07:58 You can always be too dumb and blind. It’s an unfortunate case but often occurs in these hype stocks.
1360 2018-04-11 13:07:38 Zuckerberg has been quietly selling off FB stocks!
1361 2018-04-11 13:07:38 While the futures are down almost 1% the leading stocks are down only half of that.
1362 2018-04-11 13:07:37 I'm not going to lie. This market has a very, very risky feel to it. Bonds, yield curve, gold, some currencies, etc. say stocks are too high ... perhaps WAY too high. Yet complacency still reigns. Hmm. $GLD $TLT $SPY $QQQ $VXX

1365 2018-04-11 13:05:05 From your article: "Negative screening, whereby sin stocks are excluded, can act as a drag on performance because, in line with modern portfolio theory, it limits the investment universe..." Which is what we are talking about. I'm no expect though. Best to talk to your advisor.

1369 2018-04-11 13:02:50 Agreed. Bump stocks use the recoil to enact the trigger pull at almost auto speed. THEY should be banned. Unfortunately they are easily hand made. Some rifles can be bump-fired without even a bump stock.

1376 2018-04-11 13:00:36 TA didn't tell me to go long yesterday. The neckline of the pattern and the fib at 2680 was never broken. Therefor I'm still not positioned long into SPX. A few stocks yes, but they are dated for May-July which give plenty of time for the ebb and flow of this market.

1428 2018-04-11 12:33:31 An overvaluation in an individual stock does not represent a bubble.

1460 2018-04-11 12:13:43 I think @WarrenBuffett's point that ROE is ~12% through thick and thin is extremely interesting. The academic theory is that stocks are "inflation resistant" because they can grow their earnings with inflation.  Now I'm having to think again...d'oh!

1811 2018-04-11 08:05:28 no i dont think so, once a start gets going then yeah maybe, but initially, the underlying must start to run first, giving way for increased margins....etc. so like last U308 run, it was the spot that ran first. recently Vanadium started up then the stocks....etc etc.

1855 2018-04-11 07:27:47 Yes atrocity. But unless it is TRULY possible to hit chemical weapons stocks/facilities or hit directly Damascus regime ( telecommunication centres, palace Assad residences)  it will be largely symbolic & not help

1859 2018-04-11 07:25:46 Honestly I could agree with him up until the banning of the bump stocks. But that's mostly because I want machine guns made legal *shrug*

1864 2018-04-11 07:23:51 You had me up until banning bump stocks because I believe that machine guns in and of themselves should not be banned. Maybe throw that on the pro gun side and there may be something to compromise with that like a higher tax on that class of weapon.

2087 2018-04-11 04:14:18 Agreed. Energy and commodity stocks/ETFs in general are likely to outperform this year. Another stock to consider may be FCN. Broke out of a five year range recently. Interestingly, this stock has a history of solid performance prior to, and during, economic downturns. 
2088 2018-04-11 04:13:43 So the FED bought BILLIONS of STOCKS since Trump became President to drive up the Stock Market, & make Trump look good to news/investers to influence them to think Trump is doing great

2174 2018-04-11 02:58:22 hi @ABCapitalGroup one more question pls. what is the meaning of term when u try to buy stocks?
2175 2018-04-11 02:57:41 Did @elonmusk delete the tweet from a year ago saying that Calpers should sell $Tsla and buy $F if they want corporate governance?
The stocks are almost exactly even over that time, but F paid you a five percent dividend.
And now $F's bonds are priced 300 bps better than $Tsla.
2176 2018-04-11 02:57:35 In some stocks there actually is a 'they'.
2177 2018-04-11 02:56:57 It's too bad you have made your decisions on J. McCain funded false info to start WW3 to keep the military complex financial stocks alive. When one year old info show children washed with no real terror in their faces. All mental manipulation to keep globalism alive. Failure.
2178 2018-04-11 02:56:08 I dropped them when they screwed Kelly McMillan of McMillan Stocks a few years ago.
2179 2018-04-11 02:56:00 Life is more than stocks or $.   I don’t base my worth on our $. My checkbook doesn’t show if I am a good person.  I could gain the world & lose my soul & have nada -Trump is rich but wealth isn’t my goal.  Being a decent human being & helping others is - this is why he is lost.
2180 2018-04-11 02:55:12 Awesome finance app to follow the market. Is very accurate for streaming stocks quotes . Yahoo finance beats other famous platforms that don’t show post and premarket quotes 
2181 2018-04-11 02:55:04 Wow! Mark Zuckerberg is an arrogant jerk - why would they soar?  Oh he probably bought back the stocks he sold off.
2182 2018-04-11 02:53:22 Zuckerberg wins Congressional grilling?
Actually no grilling but he bought all the NY steaks for congressional BBQ.
Can't recommend stocks here but I bought  a sizable call option on FB  2 weeks ago. Will add more tomorrow

2217 2018-04-11 02:34:03 What’s the harm in requiring journalists to be licensed? It’s common sense. Their misreporting can destroy lives and fortunes. 99.9% of owners of *standard* capacity magazines, bump stocks will never harm anyone with them. Regardless, < 5% will comply w/ bans.

2220 2018-04-11 02:30:07 I don’t agree with everything trump is doing at all but now I support him majorly because he supports police officers unlike the democrats. But he did start to ban bump stocks so he’s trying but it’s also a amendment right to own a gun it doesn’t say what type either.

2252 2018-04-11 02:04:07 Naw but I think there’s a strong case for bump stocks and high-cap mags to go, and I’d find it hard to have sympathy for people who refuse to comply with bans and become “felons overnight”

2301 2018-04-11 01:24:50 Yes it was a good investment but there are new cryptocurrencies coming up now that could have a similar appreciation but it depends on a lot of different factors. Diversifying a portfolio between stocks bonds real estate commodities currencies is a good strategy
2302 2018-04-11 01:24:01 Hasn’t “war” typically been bullish for stocks?.
2303 2018-04-11 01:23:42 also, her bill wasnt about handguns. it was about banning bump stocks and trigger cranks that make semi-automatic weapons perform like fully automatic weapons.

2308 2018-04-11 01:20:58 I’m patiently developing my craft. Observing. 

Tracking my edge calls. And frankly since July making incremental progress.

However, I’m not claiming to be able to call a bottom. I am 100% in cash tho. Last time I checked crypto was down 70% and stocks were down 9%.
2309 2018-04-11 01:20:12 @jimcramer jim, my kids (7&8) and I picked 6 stocks to buy for their small @TDAmeritrade account. AAPL/DIS/BA/LOW/BAC/TWTR. Thoughts?
2310 2018-04-11 01:19:18 I buy stocks because I expect others will buy and I can sell at a higher price. Is this foolish too.
2311 2018-04-11 01:19:13 Stocks close with big gains after China's Xi remarks calm trade-war fears.
2312 2018-04-11 01:18:24 Overnight -> Stocks rallied over the entire NY session but unlike Monday, remained bid into the close. S&P-500 +1.67%, Nasdaq +2.07%. Many noted Chinese President Xi’s conciliatory tone on U.S. trade relations overnight. President Trump tweeted gratitude thereafter. #Markets

PS: Your last header was made with the exact same stocks. Lmao.
2320 2018-04-11 01:10:02 Agree. Shorts had very little to do with the Bitcoin fall. Classic herd mentality as retail investors chased the buzz. Buzz eventually faded, and the price followed. Pot stocks had nearly identical moves, significant rise into end of year and January, buzz faded, price followed.
2321 2018-04-11 01:09:25 I don't remember the names of half the authors who spend their day or two in the Romancelandia stocks but I've been thinking of that suicide plea on and off for the last week or two.
2322 2018-04-11 01:08:48 No, they shoot black men with cell phones. Because a black man with a cell phone is a danger to coward cops. Cell phones have bump stocks.
2323 2018-04-11 01:07:54 As we have discussed in the past, Brian’s appears to be a US-centric view. EU bank stocks have begun to tank and higher US rates hits EU and other foreign banks who have been using US bonds as a carry destination. Weak USD and higher rates a feedback loop for leveraged EU banks

2345 2018-04-11 00:48:25 Yes,  Mark, killing more Syrians is the answer. Just look at Libya and Iraq, peace, prosperity, love, intervention really helps. How many oil and gas stocks you own? Asking for a friend.
2346 2018-04-11 00:47:48 US sanctions wipe billions from stocks…
2347 2018-04-11 00:47:35 Sure. Can also find Amazon went through the same in the 90s. Still can't compare. Can find isolated cases with individual stocks. With crypto it was the whole complex. And the magnitudes differ considerably.
2348 2018-04-11 00:46:37 Just checked the “stocks” app on my iPhone and all it said on the screen was “Congratulations on being the first person to ever do this!”
2349 2018-04-11 00:46:36 It looks promising.  I’m convinced things will really take off once $gvt starts trading both crypto and stocks.  I’m going to definitely invest some of my GVT into the platform and of course, HODL what i can.
2350 2018-04-11 00:46:03 talking about economics, I understand the differences between stocks and shares and their spanish equivalents as well, but then there's "Equity", I kinda get its meaning but I can't find the proper equivalent in spanish, you have any idea? sorry to bother you lol

2357 2018-04-11 00:37:24 #1, I prefer polymer over wood.  I like a pistol grip over a semi-pistol grip, and shotguns without stocks are one step above useless.

2373 2018-04-11 00:25:08 Many stocks have gone up due to speculation, haven’t you heard of the south sea bubble ? Many retail investors also buy stocks. Cash flows don’t matter in crypto economics. Forks are dividends
2374 2018-04-11 00:24:16 あれ必要か？
2375 2018-04-11 00:24:08 Anything. I said stocks, but I’m referring to anything you can trade.
2376 2018-04-11 00:22:14 Love the questions Sen Cruz. Sad that Zukerberg is so “unaware” that he can’t just answer Yes or No.  Can you find out why he sold a big chunk of his stocks in FB?  Was he possibly “aware” of something then?
2377 2018-04-11 00:22:10 Poor comparison. Stocks have cash flows. Stocks never went up 350% in two months. Most stocks investors are institutional, whom do understand stocks.

The opening statement ("BTC isn't a bubble") shows either a strong bias or lack of understanding.
2378 2018-04-11 00:21:56 Went to go check out a "Smash bros tournament" on campus and they're playing Brawl with 4 stocks....smh

2380 2018-04-11 00:19:57 That is the purpose of gun reform.

2381 2018-04-11 00:19:08 Not asking for it but the only percent that matters is the percentage your portfolio was up by year end. No doubt it was a lot as it was for everyone but ya can’t just add all stocks on top of each other and claim them as your percentage gains.
2382 2018-04-11 00:18:10 Especially when our rugby stocks are so low!
2383 2018-04-11 00:17:08 I’m so glad  I didnt sell those shares. My stocks just went up $3.39 today.

2385 2018-04-11 00:14:58 If stocks and bonds prove correlated to the downside in a sustained way, it will likely be because there’s a lot more volatility than in recent decades in the bond market (and some inflation or stagflation too!) ... stocks may be the canary in that coal mine this time

2397 2018-04-11 00:10:21 The Werewolf argued that aggressive stocks were too risky. In addition the werewolf was upset that I was not respecting the werewolf right to be upset. Eventually I became so upset that the werewolf apologized to me for misunderstanding and mistrusting me and we cooled down.
2398 2018-04-11 00:10:16 I see all this and resisted buying stocks.
2399 2018-04-11 00:09:56 The last time Trump sent 50 cruise to Syria, the market settled net higher. I would look to higher $WTIC, and related energy stocks, which isn't bold, considering the short/mid term trends.
2400 2018-04-11 00:09:34 The public in general doesn’t care. Including me. Of course it hurts the company, but stocks aren’t going to just instantly drop after a speech by its CEO. Which goes back to my point. It’s the liability, not the stocks that potentially bankrupt Facebook.
2401 2018-04-11 00:08:39 There goes out Nike stocks
