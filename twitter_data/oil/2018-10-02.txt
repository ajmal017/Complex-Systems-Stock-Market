156 2018-10-02 23:39:20 No we don’t either but a great gloss will be an indicator of a fantastic satin. I did a gloss HSL last month - they just really wanted gloss. But it just wasn’t quite the sheen that a oil based has
157 2018-10-02 23:38:49 Four years ago I expected to be dead w/in one year from an AutoImmune Disease. I began to use Rick Simpson Oil to treat my severe, chronic pain rather than use opioids. The RSO saved my life. Now I treat my disease w RSO instead of toxic RX daily chemotherapy. And I have a life.

159 2018-10-02 23:38:32 What's really fucked up is that it can make acid, oil, and mayo, but can't make eggs. Qu'est-ce que fuck?
160 2018-10-02 23:38:24 Muslim Russian Republics of Caucasus (Chechnya, Dagestan)  and their only exports: Holy terrostists and holy whores and Azerbaijan: Same as above + oil
161 2018-10-02 23:38:21 Anthropocentric conceptions are standard in Western ethics. Anthropocentrists attribute intrinsic value to human beings and not to animals or inanimate objects because they claim human beings to have certain unique properties, so oil can’t be ethical .
162 2018-10-02 23:38:05 Nelson was against offshore drilling long before the BP oil spill unlike Scott who is for offshore drilling, Nelson has always fought for FL,Scott oversaw the largest Medicare FRAUD in History, plead the 5th 75 times now under investigation for his multiple Cayman tax haven accts

167 2018-10-02 23:37:06 Ooooh yes! To me argan oil soaks into ur hair so much better than a lot of oils. Also feels good on the skin instead of greasy
168 2018-10-02 23:37:01 I need someone to come bread and fry this shrimp for me. And open all my windows, close my doors, turn on  my fans, boil lemon vinegar water, and put my shower cap on me so my home and hair don’t smell like oil. Thanks in advance.
169 2018-10-02 23:37:00 I am pleased that this is approved to go ahead (but let’s see if anything gets built - the naysayers haven’t yet come out of the woodwork).  But the whales... LNG tankers must be more ‘lightweight’ than oil  tankers!

172 2018-10-02 23:36:04 What if mineral oil has more of a negative impact overall than assumed?

Forget about just absorption of statins for a moment, what else is it doing to a human? 

That might help explain 25%.
173 2018-10-02 23:36:04 Packages Suspected of Containing Ricin Are Found at Pentagon. Ricin, which is part of the waste produced when castor oil is made, has no known antidote and can be lethal.

175 2018-10-02 23:35:48 My nails are the longest and strongest they’ve been in a while and I literally don’t really do anything? I barely file and barely apply olive oil???
176 2018-10-02 23:35:45 Does it really take oil, or is it just a cosmetic choice?
I hope power comes back soon.
177 2018-10-02 23:35:36 Coconut oil on your scalp and hair then leave it over night.. it’ll do wonders auntie lol 
178 2018-10-02 23:35:29 Maybe. Last week,  a negative oil report came out that did not prevent oil from rising to this day. The political situation between the US and Iran and the fear of oil shortages currently strongly affects oil, does not mean that can not come healthy realization in the coming days
179 2018-10-02 23:35:29 I need to release some of this oil, can feel it now

189 2018-10-02 23:32:45 1. When oil prices fall, what happens to supply of plastics?
Supply shifts to the right as price of inputs increases.
Supply shifts to the left as price of inputs decreases.
Supply shifts left as more drivers demand gasoline.

200 2018-10-02 23:30:50 You know you're not in NYC anymore when someone walks past your office at 6:30 p.m. and says "you're really burning the midnight oil."
201 2018-10-02 23:30:49 Except that there is no evidence to support this false narrative either. The US could have taken over the oil fields, but they did not.  The US doesn’t own nor do they control the oil wells.  Petrol prices in the US are extremely high.

206 2018-10-02 23:30:19 So a simple recipe: buy tempeh, cut it into cubes. Get a frying pan and dice peppers and onions into it, cook it in oil. Add Tempeh and then a good bottle of barbecue sauce. Sauté the whole thing until everything is coated, and serve it on rolls.  Fries on the side if you want.

222 2018-10-02 23:27:07 LOL, now I have googled and apparently castor oil is fine but straight up castor *beans*? Eating 8 of them will kill you. When you distill it down to ricin, it takes only a few *grains* similar to salt or sugar
223 2018-10-02 23:26:51 being 40 weeks pregnant is people telling you to stick a capsule up your vagina, drink 3 different types of teas, drink castor oil, and basically walk till your feet fall off, oh & lots of sex even if it hurts cos fuck your body you’re tryna have a baby 
224 2018-10-02 23:26:48 Sadly it’s much easier and less controversial to blame the big bad oil tankers than it is to actually deal with what’s causing the problem.
225 2018-10-02 23:26:47 Caster oil plant. Very nasty. How come you got the scoop?? I call bullshit

231 2018-10-02 23:25:34 I now read that the suicide rate is growing scary in the US (30% in the last two decades) . So you can continue to talk about the problems of others, preferably those with a lot of oil and other strategic assets.

235 2018-10-02 23:25:18 Why Saudis Can’t Keep Lid On Oil Prices-Saudi incapable of offsetting all Iran’s crude oil supplies, according to latest oil mkt message shared by several analysts who spoke to CNBC. Based on this, analysts said, Brent crude could very well hit US$100 barrel b4 this year’s end.
236 2018-10-02 23:25:17 Yes, I feel so sorry for them: 
Mexico's natural resources include silver, oil, copper and agricultural crops. The Central American country is one of the largest oil producers in the world and the third largest producer in the Americas.
237 2018-10-02 23:25:17 People bitched and complained for a year after Aaron Rodgers got hurt so the nfl made that rule to protect QB’s from those hits... lol the squeaky wheel gets the oil 
238 2018-10-02 23:24:50 I couldn’t disagree more.  If hatvwere the case, the USA would already control the oil fields and petrol wouldn’t by skyrocketing in price.  That is a false narrative.
239 2018-10-02 23:24:38 @BMWGroup can you comment or will you ?, my 06 325xi  has valve cover bolts that snapped on their own. Now oil has damaged cam sensor and I am told $2550 plus to fix.
I have never heard of bolts that snap just sitting there. This does not seem to be normal...thoughts ?

244 2018-10-02 23:24:19 Amen ... If we are not actively participating in the sharing of the WORD ... how then are we blameless before God? Keep the oil burning!
245 2018-10-02 23:24:05 #ac401 A joint cost is a cost of a production process that yields multiple products at the same time, like an oil refinery.  Some companies choose not to allocate to by-products because of the complexity of their product lines, but mostly joint costs get allocated to by-products.

基本的な話なら全部のキタユメで漫画が無料公開され、作者自身のブログも描き下ろしのイラストで溢れ返っててファンから絶大な人気があったの
287 2018-10-02 23:17:23 The oil prices are being manipulated all the time for all the parts, but there are no reason for this misery. Venezuela has been experiencing these ups and downs since long ago, and even with all their mismanagement, the old democratic governments didn't put the country in this
288 2018-10-02 23:17:23 Changing oil and replacing spark plugs perhaps . They really think we are that dumb
289 2018-10-02 23:17:09 Jordan sells snake oil.  Don't buy it.
290 2018-10-02 23:16:47 You might think your steak tips need a lot of olive oil to fry in, but really, if you want them to be nice and browned, give them a little less. They’ll be okay. You don’t need to ~drown~ them. They’ll learn and come out stronger because of it. Catch my drift people
291 2018-10-02 23:16:43 if ur brother tells you to ask the mechanic for an oil filter fuse DONT DO IT!!!! they WILL laugh at you and you WILL be embarrassed :-)
292 2018-10-02 23:16:42 Peter look up deforestation for palm oil and you will weep. We cannot have enough tree huggers, if you have kids teach them about the important of forests.
293 2018-10-02 23:16:29 Actually quite a lot comes from royalties and since this industry sector is 10% of our GDP -  yeah lots of tax dollars created there. The US sells oil to China, India and, you got it, Canada. Since the US can buy our oil at 1/3 world price and sell theirs at full price, we lose.
294 2018-10-02 23:16:22 Ur mcm can’t change the oil of his own car ...
295 2018-10-02 23:16:20 And now, finally, we will turn the tables, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

308 2018-10-02 23:14:03 The biggest thing that seems funny is that this crisis seems to be directly linked to the drop in oil prices which we know are being manipulated. We know what happened to Iran in the 50s and we know the CIA has hated the Bolivian Revolution.

316 2018-10-02 23:12:48 I wondered about that but was hoping it was even more harmless than that
I hoped it was just some glue manufacturer that had some castor oil used to make their envelope glue product
and it was false positive
But you make it seems like it is deliberate.
317 2018-10-02 23:12:39 My moms bf keeps saying my next car needs to be a luxury car... idk who y’all think I am, but even if I get the car for an amazing deal, the maintenance!! Who is tryna pay $150 or more for oil changes and whatever else?  not me!
318 2018-10-02 23:12:37 I don't know. I like coconut oil but then I heard that's not as harmless as I once thought. We might be using a walkie talkie app on cells. Have to verify on rations. Will update.
319 2018-10-02 23:12:30 Just heard on local news from sheriffs dept. A warning that cbd oil is marketed wide spread with many not true cbd, like other products you could be buying fakes. This sciences needs fast track as I know of one 70 year old that quit opiates his pain gone 1 dose a day?

323 2018-10-02 23:11:57 Who's buying American oil at 150$ a barrel? Health and child care are paid by taxes, just like the billions of tax dollars wasted with this fabulous dream gift to the shareholders of kinder-morgan. It will be a long,long time if ever before this stupid pipeline pays anything back

325 2018-10-02 23:11:46 Is the accounting of FAR's share of the potential oil concession is been mistaken for the whole deal? 

My understanding of the deal is:
the accounting is like this from what I understand:

80% Far, 20% Gambia.

From Far's 80%,
40% Far
40% PetronasMalaysia 
20% ErineFlorida.
326 2018-10-02 23:11:13 Use olbas oil / echinacea!

331 2018-10-02 23:10:09 I make 80k a year. Getting 2k more in tax breaks. Do you thi k education is better now than 30 years ago? Infrastructure is in massive decline over past 15 years. Cannot even drive o  the roads in Vermont. Electricity, heating oil went way up under democrats.

343 2018-10-02 23:07:14 I hope there's part where he hisses, "My name is VENOMMMM," then licks his long, misshapen fangs with his alien tongue, and then tells a long story about working on an olive oil farm.

345 2018-10-02 23:06:23 The problem is have to take quite a lot more of Krill to get the same amout of DHA & EPA as fish or algae oils, & overfishing Krill is not so ecologically sound. It makes more sense to take algae oil & astaxanthin. I like Minami Vegan DHA. #health #Omega3 #ecofriendly #oceans

396 2018-10-02 23:00:05 Hey...if it aint broke!

397 2018-10-02 23:00:02 Wow, he saw someone throw a glass. Amazing. American news is astonishing. In , we report oil spills, corporate crime.  must be stupid.
398 2018-10-02 23:00:01 More often than not when you see a rich person, just remember that if your grandfather or great-grandfather had been a pimp, bootlegger, slumlord or poisoned the earth as a oil baron, or otherwise been a piece of crap, you'd be rich now too.

The "self-made man" is a myth.

406 2018-10-02 22:59:22 "Trinidadians have a gimmie gimmie attitude! We subsidized fuel! 29 billion! Time to stop it!"

1. We produce oil. Obviously a subsidy made sense. 
2. The issue is not removing the subsidy. It's removing the subsidies, while increasing cost of living with no salary increase.

411 2018-10-02 22:58:55 I don't know, but if we have that now, we would grow as no one would depend on oil. Everyone would be forced to develop their regions based on their revenue, but until the 60s,other tribes would be allowed
412 2018-10-02 22:58:49 @chigrl I got a question. For my studies I am doing a research paper which is all about oil. It will include time series analysis, deep learning.. Would you be willing to answer some question, with your experience:)?(sorry, didn't find a way to contact you in private) Best wishes

414 2018-10-02 22:58:43 True. But, if I only drove 1,000/yr, I'd likely not want to leave oil sitting in there for 5 - 8yrs.

420 2018-10-02 22:57:57 That's sorta accurate. Remember that the largest % of saudi people are non wahbidts who live / work in the oil regions and are a ON. MICROSTATES AROUND SAUDI ARE MUCH MORE LIKE WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
421 2018-10-02 22:57:52 I've heard the Nip + Fab teenage range is good too. Shame Liz Earle didn't help you. Thanks for letting me know about the mask, my skin has the tendency to get oil build up. I'll give it a go! Spots in your 20s is just cruel lol.
422 2018-10-02 22:57:50 Just to show you the intellectual rigor and reflective of the people supporting the closing down of the Oil/Gas industry.

424 2018-10-02 22:57:19 I...what is the rationale for this? Oil and gas regs I get, because the oil industry owns the GOP. This though? Is there a nuclear lobby that I'm not aware of or do they just want to kill people?
425 2018-10-02 22:57:07 Scott Hartnell interview on @TSN1260 is awesome so far. Wish the oil had him in his prime that guy was mucky but could score!

429 2018-10-02 22:56:30 Mom: look I found this cute jar for the vegetable oil. I just wish it was as big as that green container

Me: you mean the Jagermeister bottle? 

"Yeah"
430 2018-10-02 22:56:28 Stop taking dirty $$ @USFS_Enterprise! Your mission is to protect our forests and national parks, not exploit them for oil and gas drilling!!! Get off the fossil fuel payroll and do your job!!! #FossilFree #NoPipelines
431 2018-10-02 22:56:24 Even if Trump falls short of his goal and Iran is able to continue selling about 1 million barrels a day, as it did during Obama’s presidency, the country’s partial exit from global oil markets would still leave a big hole in supply....
432 2018-10-02 22:55:56 Hmmmm Why are all the posts and pictures of hemp, cbd oil cures, and cancer killing marijuana pics being banned or deleted from my facebook?
433 2018-10-02 22:55:55 That's BS.  Chuck is a lieing snake oil salesmen.
434 2018-10-02 22:55:51 The little pay I get will be eclipsed by the benefits I receive from this job. I get to go to equinox whenever? That subscription like 200$+ a month b. Lemme get them eucalyptus oil soaked towel to rub my genitals with. My body finna loooove me
435 2018-10-02 22:55:41 I use the garnier serum in the that little pump bottle or the Tarte marajuca oil. Both work great! I usually put some in every other week

437 2018-10-02 22:55:22 tea tree oil is too drying for me :(
438 2018-10-02 22:55:20 Somebody needs to mess with her wardrobe!  Sometimes, we should leave the t-shirts at home to clean house or change the oil on your car, but wearing that out if public is like saying, I'm a bully and I have a gun in my purse if you say the wrong thing to me!

447 2018-10-02 22:54:03 There are flaws in it. But they are not flaws that would affect a  strong economy like the UK. They are more a problem for weak economies that may need to devalue. If UK joined then we could end up with it being stronger than the dollar and oil being priced in it.
448 2018-10-02 22:54:01 I want some cbd oil

467 2018-10-02 22:50:32 Yes however Saudi’s doubling in to flush out tight oil investments wasn’t anticipated at that level.  Think this goes to show and what I’ve seen recently geopolitically oil is only concerned with the now.

487 2018-10-02 22:47:30 Natural gas is a fossil fuel.
  When we authorize its taking out of the ground to be burnt for any purpose we own the life cycle emissions associated with it. The same goes for oil and coal. It is too late in the day to bee talking about net emissions.

505 2018-10-02 22:46:03 #NappilyEverAfter is a beautiful film with an even beautiful message but that oil scene should have been CUT
506 2018-10-02 22:45:59 That increase is caused by the price of crude oil; which is set by the global market. OPEC has a major control in the price of fuel.

509 2018-10-02 22:45:41 Yes @kadaster_mehmet I'm fully aware that Wahhabists are the cause of 90% of Islamic terrorism and are the problem.  However due to the fact that they're so rich due to oil they're expanding their influence over the entire Islamic world at a worrying rate including Turkey.

579 2018-10-02 22:35:56 Every time I go to get my oil changed I get really nervous, please stop asking me questions, I’m nervous and barely know what cars are
580 2018-10-02 22:35:41 Add fresh lemon. Straight lemon oil is better but only if it’s doterra.

583 2018-10-02 22:34:40 Oil and gas is already at record high production levels. 

It's time to stop expanding the infrastructure and invest that money in renewables now.

588 2018-10-02 22:34:23 I have some hash oil. It would actually be very effective at SLOWLY entering the pores & thus the blood stream for quite the buzz. AND enhance the physique at the same time.
589 2018-10-02 22:34:06 Vast majority of the rise in fuel prices is due to the rising price of crude oil - not the Govt's fault.  The Nat Govt failed to maintain the infrastructure - roading, bridges etc so now we have to not just pay for current maintenance but back pay for what Nat's should have OR
590 2018-10-02 22:33:50 I heard bio oil! But you have to use it multiple times a day for it to work
591 2018-10-02 22:33:22 Social anxiety is making your dad go get you an oil change for your car so you don't have to talk to people or get stuck answering questions you don't know the answer to.

593 2018-10-02 22:33:13 It's really easy. Just dissolve some sugar in water. I use extract/oil essences for flavor; usually citrus. But I do use chocolate when my Ma/Pa pharmacy has it.
They carry little bottles of the oils/extracts that are $.99 each!!!!! I keep myself stocked. I make my own jello.

596 2018-10-02 22:32:56 Also the notion of restricting alcohol & using CBD oil is hilarious. That shit is so much more expensive. Working class cant afford it
597 2018-10-02 22:32:55 At least once a week I finish a bunch of reports but save the emails to my drafts. When I feel like dipping out early, I just use my phone to send a report out every 15 minutes on the commute home.

630 2018-10-02 22:28:50 Lopez Obrador has to make some tough decisions. Allocate enough money to both oil & gas, allow outside investments and increase production. On the other hand, if he takes the protectionist approach relying on Pemex alone, that would have very bad consequences for Mexican oil/gas.

633 2018-10-02 22:28:23 Yeah, pretty much. And it means that if you want to use other ships to level them up a bit while you're farming, your oil's gonna take a hit. It's just a weird/bad system. 

Personally I've just given up and accepted that I'm using like 40+ oil a fight so I can raise ships.
634 2018-10-02 22:28:22 LOL, no one thinks that?  Are you new to the internet?, google "essential oil cures" or "urine therapy" these are your people that share your fear and disgust of Doctors and big pharma.

718 2018-10-02 22:17:16 who do y’all think fucks the olives to make non-virgin olive oil
719 2018-10-02 22:17:16 I'm all for working toward more sustainable energy, but oil demand is going up with or without #TMX. So why not use #cdnoil?  While you've handicapped Canada, the US is pumping record amounts ($11MM) and exporting it!!
720 2018-10-02 22:17:15 @RealDonad_Trump oil prices are going through the roof. Want to see your economy tank just let oil and gas prices climb and people will quit spending.
721 2018-10-02 22:16:54 I didn’t have time to cook..... so for dinner I’m having just white rice with olive oil and soy sauce....................and it is perfect

729 2018-10-02 22:16:09 Diamonds only have worth because companies like DeBeers withhold diamonds to artificially create scarcity, creating a monopoly on the product. OPEC does the same with Oil.
730 2018-10-02 22:16:09 Very sad indeed. The woman selling akara and bread near my house is using the same oil for over 2 weeks now

745 2018-10-02 22:13:56 Today my child said, 'mini cheddars have palm oil in them'. 
I said (absently) 'oh, you like mini cheddars'. 
'MUM. I did a talk on deforestation. I'm not going to eat mini cheddars again now I know they have palm oil.'

747 2018-10-02 22:13:53 No, Up&Go is worse than a flavoured milk. Besides a load of sugar that would make Coke blush, it is also full of seed oil.  And even worse it is marketed as health food (when it is anything but).

751 2018-10-02 22:13:39 that’s how I saw it when framing the shot, old oil paintings often included crumpled and wilted flowers and the contrast was ideal on a dull day

756 2018-10-02 22:13:11 Only if it's sufficiently advanced cryptography.
There's lots of other crypto that's indistinguishable from snake oil or newspaper puzzles :-)
757 2018-10-02 22:13:10 This mostly factors into farming, where you want to reduce your oil costs as much as possible to maximise your runs, but it doesn't add anything to the game apart from more micromanagement. It's just annoying. You're pretty much being punished for raising + limit breaking units.
758 2018-10-02 22:13:06 really wanna try oil painting this year 
759 2018-10-02 22:12:41 It's like I'm drilling for oil

768 2018-10-02 22:09:59 @realDonaldTrump must stop exporting USA oil  until our prices drop and gas goes down to under 2.40 gal
769 2018-10-02 22:09:56 I hope @AllisonforMD kicks your butt.
Voting on those tax cuts for the rich showed you don't care about anything but lining your own pockets.
Still got those Russian oil stocks?
770 2018-10-02 22:09:52 The cost system on Azur Lane is kind of stupid. It'd be one thing if it was a cost limit thing, but no, it just means you use more oil - your stamina, in other words. 

So if you raise your ships, you then get punished for using them by being able to play less. Like... what?
771 2018-10-02 22:09:51 Have you gotten your oil changed?
772 2018-10-02 22:09:44 I doubt we’ll ever be relegated lol but we definitely need drastic changes on the board. I’m torn between an oil money owner or football mafia owner like Madrid and Juve. American owners are blood suckers!
773 2018-10-02 22:09:42 I need a proper spot treatment. you guys lied about tea tree oil
774 2018-10-02 22:09:39 This #aromatherapy humidifier is amazing. Rosemary essential oil is just what the doctor [should have] ordered!

Breathing! Ah! I can't believe they let me do this! :D
775 2018-10-02 22:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

778 2018-10-02 22:09:13 Your "opinion" is basic liberal talking points. In the real world Texas is prosperous and part of the reason for that is having over two decades of conservative leadership. Go peddle some snake oil to suckers online. Texans are doing just fine under Cruz. #MAGA #CruzCrew

780 2018-10-02 22:09:09 S/o to the guy at jiffy lube, gave me a new air filter, and filled my fluids all for free. Plus on top of that, gave me $15 off even though i was WAY past my oil change (go figure) lol
781 2018-10-02 22:08:53 You make it wrong, how to cook ramen 101
- boil it
- drain it
- put it in a frying pan
- add a dash of oil
- crack an egg on top
- fry it and mix it up
- add the flavour packet and maybe an oxo cube if you are feeling lucky
- serve on a plate
782 2018-10-02 22:08:51 Anybody wanna pay for my oil change I’ll feed you
783 2018-10-02 22:08:37 Always check your hood is closed after repairs mine wasn’t 3 times. I always change my oil every 3000 miles it’s my car they do what I want
784 2018-10-02 22:08:28 No man. The Venezuelan oil at some time was sold at more of US$ 140 per barrel and all the money was robbed and wasted. There are no excuses for the robbery. Even Saint Chavez made a business with Kirchner from Argentina to steal both countries with bonuses.
785 2018-10-02 22:08:25 Trump is a huckster, a snake oil seller, one of the deepest traditions America has is to fall for this type
786 2018-10-02 22:08:24 I hate getting my oil changed but I’m on top of my maintenance with my car
787 2018-10-02 22:08:22 And it's still ok to drive everywhere, fly off on holiday, attract tourists all the way down here, add more + more cows, favour offsets over actually not emitting, resist ending oil & gas exploration/extraction ..because change is too hard??
Get wise #nzpol
Min 3-4° C far worse.
788 2018-10-02 22:08:16 Coconut oil!
789 2018-10-02 22:08:10 Why do you need to specify? Then ask yourself do you need to specify where your owners money comes from. People say oil money as code for Arab money. And if people said Arab money then the racism would be undeniable
790 2018-10-02 22:08:05 @realDonaldTrump promised to reign the greedy oil  speculators who falsely drive up oil $!! Spiking Gas  gal$! USA is awash in oil! @POTUS must stop Exporting Oil til our Prices drop!
791 2018-10-02 22:08:02 Hmmm. Can’t eat blankets or teddy bears. How about increasing foreign aid to feed these kids? Kissing babies as old as politics itself. Oh, we reduced aid to this country recently? No surprise. Sarah you should be ashamed of yourself promoting this kind of snake oil sales pitch.

801 2018-10-02 22:06:37 Nigeria economy has withnesed a lot of govt policies over the years all aimed at growth. The policies though good but lack adequate implimentations. We have also withnesed a stop gap approach policies to the economy. Our main base agriculture was abandoned after discovery of oil.

805 2018-10-02 22:05:54 Not sure how you approve one deal on oil and not the other? Sounds pretty hypocritical to me?
806 2018-10-02 22:05:52 The Democrat, Wolf is the only one who believes the gas & oil companies taking Pennsylvania’s natural resources should pay a severance tax. This will repair the roads, also help fund education & more. These companies come from out of state & should pay their fair share! #PA #FBR
807 2018-10-02 22:05:40 I was a born natural in Oil and Gas law. The one course i never regreted doing. The professor from Uniben who taught it became my good friend cos he started buying fanta after each afternoon class and we'd gist about life before he'd go back to Uniben.
808 2018-10-02 22:05:39 The dressing is champagne vinegar, olive oil and honey
809 2018-10-02 22:05:38 I get real excited when I read on some packaging that oil has been expeller-pressed
810 2018-10-02 22:05:37 Roast them and serve sliced at room temp on a bed of lettuce or arugula with a little goat cheese, some toasted walnuts and a drizzle of goood olive oil. Yummy!

Also,

But yes you're right it's those damn socialists from 10 years ago that ruined it

814 2018-10-02 22:05:05 Economies are different, price of oil and therefore consequential neglect of the investments is the reason for their decline in economy. They invested heavily in education and health, positive in my opinion.
815 2018-10-02 22:04:57 But you know what those Senators DO represent? The food this country eats. The oil this country uses to fuel their cars. The water that California drinks. Go ahead, alienate that 44%, and see what happens.
816 2018-10-02 22:04:37 How are the oil prices in Russia?
817 2018-10-02 22:04:27 just plain ones with some olive oil

wait technically doesn't that mean they're not plain?!
818 2018-10-02 22:04:22 They are! I always recommend them to people love ok’ing for cars. We bought ours new and have only had to do basic maintenance on it (oil, filters, and one set of tires since dec 2015). Are you getting a plug in or the regular hybrid?

839 2018-10-02 22:00:20 Funny version. Very one eyed. 

In some countries wind and solar elctricity is big. Those can be stepped up faster - well motivated by prices - for fx oil and gas.

844 2018-10-02 22:00:04 Kanye really pisses me the fuck off. You ever seen someone so stupid anything regarding to them makes you want to drown them in hot oil? That’s the equivalent energy for reading anything to do with that man.
845 2018-10-02 22:00:02 I love that gif too! 
As Adi said, oil dries slower. As an obsessive blender I love that you can keep reworking it!  Waterpaint dries fast, so the way you work it is different. But it's all paint. I hope you find what best suits your style! Let us know how you go! 
846 2018-10-02 21:59:17 So the big lie is that demand planning - which works great for retail goods can and should be applied to ag and dairy. Problem is we see the results in the oil industry where they flood the market or cut back (OPEC). Alberta's recession was caused but this. It is not win-win.

851 2018-10-02 21:58:28 they charged me an extra $15 because apparently “mercedes, volvo, vw, and bmw have special shaped oil filters” and i was like ??? doesn’t matter. don’t charge me extra!!!
852 2018-10-02 21:58:20 Gold diggers digging until they found oil
853 2018-10-02 21:58:12 Yee mine cost about 30-40 at the dealership but back when I had my Jetta they were easily 80-90 because of the synthetic oil. Definitely weird!
854 2018-10-02 21:58:10 There are no bigger diseases that have snake oil salesmen than IC well maybe fibromyalgia. Anything to do with medical mj for the next ten or 15 years Read the label. Herbs and supplements are big business just like pharmacuticals are.

860 2018-10-02 21:57:31 Red oil #20?????
861 2018-10-02 21:57:30 My fave immediately started breaking out when that oil and this braiding hair touched my face 
862 2018-10-02 21:57:30 So you know coal. What makes this coal clean and beautiful? How is it better than oil?
863 2018-10-02 21:57:25 i have a vw too sister!!! ive gone to two places that have tried to play me now and that’s always their excuse  but now i know the oil type so i just tell them and my car is in tip top shape 
864 2018-10-02 21:57:20 They told me it was the same stuff I got last time but I don’t remember ever spending more than $40 for an oil change :( I’ll do more research next time
865 2018-10-02 21:56:57 Yes, but now when we look att this even if he won that race it wouldn't be enough....There is nothing he can do as he hit dump track with oil...it happens, its racing...just hope in Japan on soft he will fight for the win...
866 2018-10-02 21:56:45 hey um any art majors wanna teach me the dark art that is oil painting
867 2018-10-02 21:56:20 Pity it's not an 'oil on canvas' instead of a photo - it could make you millions at Christies!!
868 2018-10-02 21:56:14 I agree, the US and China are leading mass energy transition but also fully equipped to exchange oil, so as to fund such aggressive moves. Transition s take time, we should tithe part of all royalties to green innovation (but not shut down this sector of our economy).
869 2018-10-02 21:56:12 The big problem with stir-fry is that your entire kitchen eventually becomes coated in oil.
870 2018-10-02 21:56:07 I doubt there any sense in your tweets, when oil producing countries are leaning towards free education,  your govt is trying to bury educ, and you are seeing a positive side to it? Which part of the planet are you from? It's bcos of people like you the govt keeps doing this.
871 2018-10-02 21:56:07 My Mrs got it so bad getting out of bed was very difficult Honestly she tried everything.I put her on the cbd oil for a week hasn't had attack over a year. Got her a vaporiser if she feels it coming on,she uses it no attack or days in bed non addictive herbal extract thank God

874 2018-10-02 21:55:48 Just finished drying my hair but I put too much hair oil on and now it looks even worse than before I even washed it

876 2018-10-02 21:55:26 There’s plumping scrubs, a bit of coconut oil with cinnamon and cayane powder.
877 2018-10-02 21:55:23 When he was rubbing the oil on her head... wtf was that?? 
878 2018-10-02 21:55:14 Oh, dinner was so, so good. Beans and sausage followed by a salad with apple vinegar and oil. I was good and didn't overeat, even though I was tempted to go for some quince apple marmalade for dessert.

@matthewogray incumbent Dem won't explain why he's taken money from Anadarko (yes that oil & gas company that blew up the family in Firestone) and won't support Prop 112, which keeps wells 2500 ft from our houses, schools and parks. WTF?
881 2018-10-02 21:55:03 Had to get my oil changed and annual inspection done today. 

Spent an hour in a “customer lounge” with the lone TV tuned to Fox News. 

I would like to sincerely thank people like @atrupar who summarize this channel. I feel icky....and dumber after that experience.
882 2018-10-02 21:54:53 Rational thought cannot overcome or change the mind of someone hell bent on using false equivacation to support their fast held beliefs.
883 2018-10-02 21:54:50 I’m in bed with the lurgy and I just asked on my house group chat if anyone had any Olbas Oil - next thing I know, my housemate’s at my door with a bottle of it. She’s the best 
884 2018-10-02 21:54:45 Donal Trump is a crook, a snake oil salesman. He has profited through tax evasion and ripping off contractors. There is a reason no US bank would deal with him. Now he's profiting off the US taxpayers in plain sight. Disgusting
885 2018-10-02 21:54:24 Tea tree oil I believe could help?
886 2018-10-02 21:54:23 No but corm oil is used for food and fuel etc...
887 2018-10-02 21:54:22 You know, I actually use a different essential oil for my anxiety. I could check with who made it for me for all the ingredients but the main one is peppermint and just smelling it helps me so incredibly much.
888 2018-10-02 21:53:57 My future wife probably needs her oil changed and her tires rotated
889 2018-10-02 21:53:51 Yes!! That’s covered in oil and crystals right?
890 2018-10-02 21:53:38 Oil change just put a dent in my wallet family
891 2018-10-02 21:53:36 I’m back with my coconut oil. LIT  natural hair is about to be poppin!!

maybe it might spur me to finally post a vid
893 2018-10-02 21:53:31 Friendly reminder- too much snake oil on your baloney sandwich and it gets soggy and gross.
894 2018-10-02 21:53:19 Everytime I get an oil change I just lie and say “yea I know it’s messed up I have a mechanic getting everything together this week” the we can fix it for a billion dollars yap stops there.
895 2018-10-02 21:53:16 i just attempted to get an oil change by myself at walmart and they were so mean i left to me so if my car breaks down just know it’s cause ima cry baby
896 2018-10-02 21:53:13 Family member had good luck with a grapefruit and olive oil gallbladder cleanse. Another friend bought a cleanse online  and said it worked great. Passed stones and felt better.
897 2018-10-02 21:53:11 Alaskans own 107,390 shares of SARAS SPA, worth $205,712. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in ITALY.
898 2018-10-02 21:53:05 British government is evil.British government killed a lot of Biafra children since 1914 till day.they re using buhari to killing of Biafra people because of crude oil.
899 2018-10-02 21:53:05 Care workers wages aren't  going up with any rapidity given the resource shortfall- economic theory scarce resource increase cost?  Works for oil or coffee, not human labour? Would be more impressed with argument if those wages were now £25ph. But they're not. #LBC
900 2018-10-02 21:52:56 Nostradamus predicted a 27 year world war starting this year. Perry Stone said God told him Iran and oil back about ..idk 10 years ago
901 2018-10-02 21:52:38 Because you don’t need to specify where the money comes from you tit, money is money and the fact you need to specify that it’s comes from a oil rich/Arabic country but you don’t specify where other clubs backers get their money from is a racist.
902 2018-10-02 21:52:35 Paid... none. Helping out because I was there around 18-20.
Only grown purposefully if it's horse or other pets. The oil if the financial driving force nor the byproduct.
903 2018-10-02 21:52:33 Thing with changing annually and you lived on a farm I suspect the dust reduced the lubricant's life. You would have to use a synthetic oil filter as it filters better and can handle thinner viscosity but even then the tiniest of particles are still present.
904 2018-10-02 21:52:22 My backpack is making a squeaky noise like it needs some damn oil every time I take a step. Quite upset.

910 2018-10-02 21:51:18 Hot oil before I put the weave in and when I have it I put some growth oil on my scalp
911 2018-10-02 21:51:17 How much are you getting paid by the oil industry to spam ppls mentions with this???
912 2018-10-02 21:51:11 Mike in Phantasm II as it was my 1st intro to franchise . Love the open graves scene. I worked in graveyards when I made tombstones Melrose, Mn during HS in the 90’s. My uncle Larry who works in the oil fields in Williston ND. Introduced me to Phantasm his was Reggie in 1.
913 2018-10-02 21:51:09 Yes agreed. Not sure what Norwegians should do about their oil exports. Shutting oil exports off wouldn’t affect oil demand or use one way or the other presumably.
914 2018-10-02 21:50:50 How many farms have you worked on? The massive amount of corn and soy is grown mainly for animal feed. The oil is the by-product. Ask some farmers
915 2018-10-02 21:50:48 You might say she is on a crusade. She is a true believer and a true believer will ignore all evidence ( no matter how true ) that contradicts views that they have come to passionately embrace.
916 2018-10-02 21:50:19 I havent used cocoa products, beard oil, or mustache wax since my handlebar mustache was ripped off by a handcrank chocolate mill in 2010
917 2018-10-02 21:50:05 Tonight: lazy dinner of korean dumplings (purchased) w/ black vinegar and chile oil, alongside rice & kimchi.

918 2018-10-02 21:49:46 it’s oil, tire, and brake changing season

Good ol brent.
923 2018-10-02 21:48:49 Most of these Mosques will have been financed by the Saudis. If oil had never been discovered in the Middle East, Islam would  never have experienced a resurgence. Discuss #Islamiscancer
924 2018-10-02 21:48:47 i pretty much just haven't done much traditional art in general since starting college with the exception of a couple oil paintings
925 2018-10-02 21:48:47 i would like to know who has actually used the oil paint filter in photoshop
926 2018-10-02 21:48:45 Ah but you said you wanted oil. Smh
927 2018-10-02 21:48:24 There was a holistic thing I read about involving fasting, drinking only water and a cup of olive oil before bed, lying on your left side while sleeping. I never did it, I just had surgery. Good luck
928 2018-10-02 21:48:22 That's a nice idea but we have to operate in the real world where Big Oil isn't going to give up a thing.
929 2018-10-02 21:48:17 It's good news. Electricity doesn't replace plastic and other oil refinement products entirely though. I think we are looking at displacement of coal, not really oil in this article, but Canada needs to take note and strap royalty payments to green-innovation.
930 2018-10-02 21:48:15 Too many oil spills for Exxon

934 2018-10-02 21:48:03 I'm being pragmatic I respect your utopian Somaliweyn but let's be practical Independent Ogaden will be just a blob & with z oil it will be a curse.  My suggestion keep your autonomy negotiate good % of n/resource & take your place in Ethiopian politics & even play a leading role
935 2018-10-02 21:48:03 You clearly have a short memory. Check your attendances in the 80s & 90s.... Before the oil tycoon roled into town #Dogshite

939 2018-10-02 21:47:37 (If only I could find a brush that I know how to use that isn't that one flat oil one )
940 2018-10-02 21:47:25 No its not. It's grown for the oil then the leftover is fed to cattle
941 2018-10-02 21:47:20 Anthony cut onions and MY eyes watered they were so bad its been like more than 5 minutes and MY EYES STILL FEEL LIKE THEYRE SIMMERING IN A THIN POOL OF OIL REEE

943 2018-10-02 21:47:00 oops, I scanned it in under a minute, lol. 
about time! even my Grandma uses CBD oil for arthritis and yes, glaucoma.
happy to rt! :)
944 2018-10-02 21:46:55 TCU has taken positions antithetical to Christian values in general. Anyone interested can Google it up. Used to be a exemplary university, but the leftist cancer has taken hold. Should remove the Christian from the name. Its embarrassing
945 2018-10-02 21:46:53 Getchu a bad bitch who also gets her oil changed regularly
946 2018-10-02 21:46:51 Got my oil changed and tires rotated today, that felt super adult-y. I also ate goldfish and fruit snacks for lunch and made an impulse decision to chop off my hair. Ya know, balance.
947 2018-10-02 21:46:49 random question i know, but i need to know an answer: what all kinds of supplements come in gelcap form? other than say, fish oil, or vitamin D and A. 

it’s for sneaky fuckery, all in a good cause
948 2018-10-02 21:46:43 Does beard oil count? It's so cedarwoody.
949 2018-10-02 21:46:37 I use CBD cream or oil on my hands and  feet. If I'd known 40 years ago what I know now, I would have saved my bong scrapings.

955 2018-10-02 21:45:23 Cbd oil   in holland and barrett very good for a lot off things.. I take it instead off my depression meds 
956 2018-10-02 21:45:18 F the peanut butter and toast. Eat eggs, fruit, lean meats. Avacado, grapefruit, mixed nuts, greens.. pump some iron then water with protein powder, raw cacao powder and olive oil. Chicken, fish and occasionally some excellent beef, veggies no dairy.

958 2018-10-02 21:45:06 Maraming salamat efficascent oil 
959 2018-10-02 21:45:04 Cheers. Much appreciated. I do disagree about "plenty" and Harvard Business Review claims scarcity is the number one driver of innovation, but sadly doesn't give examples! I've gone with peak oil & the move towards sustainable transport, but it's not great so you could be right.
960 2018-10-02 21:45:03 That's a valid point, but after listening to an Ezra Klein podcast about the success and failure of Liberalism, it makes sense with the ebb and flow of power from Right to Left that it does both. The economic (oil) pursuit spurs the counterforce of humanitarianism and vice versa.
961 2018-10-02 21:44:59 any specific oil or no?
962 2018-10-02 21:44:55 Whoever says “We’ll always have Paris” didn’t read this reminder warning from the @UN about #climatechange. The #ParisAccord's not working, and the UN says we have under 2 years to avoid runaway climate change. The window is closing. The solution is soil. Not oil.
963 2018-10-02 21:44:53 Frying in oil kills all germs!
964 2018-10-02 21:44:49 Oil will be needed for next 15-20 years. Kinder's oil pipeline has operated successfully for 65 years. B.C. has no right to say "just send enough oil for B.C. only. In for a penny, in for a pound. Of course solar power is the future and will happen globally eventually...
965 2018-10-02 21:44:37 Lol you live in an oilfield town. Literally oil and gas stimulates everything around you.
966 2018-10-02 21:44:27 I have Marula oil in my bathroom. Feel free to go down and grab it. It’s in the floater shelf —bottom middle compartment, white bottle. Maybe your skin will accept it more?
967 2018-10-02 21:44:10 They can’t even understand basic subsidies.. I’m not about to throw out the all the subsidies oil receives 
968 2018-10-02 21:44:03 Tea tree vitamin e avocado peppermint and coconut oil are just a few oils that don't work for me thanks though I have complicated skin. Shea butter too greasy as well. I have to be careful about putting oils on my oily face.
969 2018-10-02 21:43:44 my dad just called pods “vape oil” & “vape piss”
970 2018-10-02 21:43:44 ive had the absolute worst dry skin for years. i tried literally every lotion in the world and so i bought cbd oil and THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT FUCKING WORKS AND NOW MY SKIN IS FINE
971 2018-10-02 21:43:34 We buy the oil.

973 2018-10-02 21:43:20 Ironically Feisty, his son is a conservative. They don't really get along very well. Son sez oil & water, but laughs about it. Go figure. 
974 2018-10-02 21:43:11 Can of butter milk biscuit , cut in four,hot vegetable oil , sugar powder .. you’re welcome  I do mine homemade 
975 2018-10-02 21:43:08 I think oil leaks and poorly maintained pipelines should carry heavier consequences than what exists currently. Oil businesses should know that crimes against humanity and the environment have consequences.
976 2018-10-02 21:42:59 A massage from a good and caring hand with coconut oil in place can solve it if you are ready
977 2018-10-02 21:42:56 Lofty has had more than a few run ins with either the lead singer from Midnight Oil or a center city based bar fly that looks just like him.

980 2018-10-02 21:42:36 These oil sultans spare no expense when it comes to footballers.
981 2018-10-02 21:42:29 Ever since my dad has retired he’s been looking for stuff to do. He done my oil change, my spark plugs, the roof, apparently my tires tomorrow. Will it ever end? 
982 2018-10-02 21:42:19 I'm allergic to the oil so i'll settle for wine.
983 2018-10-02 21:42:16 Conkers don’t work but I’ve heard peppermint oil does. 
984 2018-10-02 21:42:07 Coconut oil
985 2018-10-02 21:42:06 Any idea why TOG, KEL others took such a beating today despite $75 oil?
986 2018-10-02 21:41:58 Gold diggers dig until they find oil
987 2018-10-02 21:41:54 And you should think about all offices in Geneva.  Home to Wahhabe Summer Palace, Private Banks, Petroleum Trading Office and Lots of NGO.
Swiss took off their mask recently and are putting profits for industry over world's interests.  Palm Oil, Pesticides, Weapons...
988 2018-10-02 21:41:54 My problem with edibles is they make it way harder to control dose, so I'd rather ingest or vape oil probably. But I'm starting to think it'd be worth looking into!
989 2018-10-02 21:41:54 World leaders literally publicly dissociate their favor for him and we have less talks w other countries bc no one wants to talk with him!

Oil and gas are coming back up sooo is it a good thing that gas prices are getting more expensive?

994 2018-10-02 21:41:31 I second the no coconut oil thing. Figure out your hair porosity. High porosity hair dries out faster and absolutely needs an oil, gel or some kind of sealant on it after you moisturize, low porosity hair doesn’t absorb products well so it will seem like stuff just sits on your

1005 2018-10-02 21:40:30 The sad part is even with this huge amount, the US is on the low end for oil subsidies if I'm not mistaken.
Last study done concluded that over 6% of Global GDP goes to oil industries. That's trillions of dollars a year.
1006 2018-10-02 21:40:28 That is the Republican way. Destroy the opponent because there is nothing good about their policies or their record.

How about we feed these kids? A little foreign aid goes a long way. TRUMP snake oil sales at its best. So sad.

1018 2018-10-02 21:39:31 My gawd Gerry...the exact same argument can be applied to Alberta oil export! What’s up with your change of heart? Does this translate to immediate approval of Energy East and immediately proceeding with finalization of Trans Mountain
1019 2018-10-02 21:39:31 Tea tree oil helps a bit but you have to use it consistently
1020 2018-10-02 21:39:28 This is a line of witch hazel. How do we get NG out of the ground? Is it that much different than oil? You are making the case that low pressure oil lines are safer and more “eco-friendly” than very high pressure gas lines. I build these things. You’re a nut

1137 2018-10-02 21:25:16 War has its banal contradictions. While in some parts of the world people are killed for power, for drug trafficking, for territory, for oil, etc., in the USA war is for who is more prostitute: a Democrat or a Republican...
1138 2018-10-02 21:25:14 Omg. Al Gore couldn’t run a lemonade stand. He’s a snake oil salesman.
1139 2018-10-02 21:25:13 Isnt he the one who stole a garbage file and it contained a virus that was holding oil tankers hostage, but then he and his friends hacked the planet and everyone lived happily ever after?

1144 2018-10-02 21:24:50 Didn’t Bush the Younger run an oil company into the ground as well?
1145 2018-10-02 21:24:47 I agree wit you Doug...

You & your mob just shot killed and bombed them while they sleep all for the price of oil #Iran #Iraq to name a tiny few

1147 2018-10-02 21:24:25 Every few months! How? Do you use the dipping method with poppyseed oil and clove leaf oil?
1148 2018-10-02 21:23:54 Thats how you fight terror! The west was picking its nose digging for treasure while jihadist was running a muck across the Turkish & Jordanian border into syria only then when russia entered were the oil routes to washington DC were shut down 
1149 2018-10-02 21:23:53 How about  ideological gas and oil or ideological species at risk. One of my current fav is ideological darkness, then again, there's ideological turn on the lights I can't see a thing.

1157 2018-10-02 21:22:56 The oil guy?
1158 2018-10-02 21:22:55 Hopefully, Russia will increase their already large gold reserves and not include this new revenue in their budget. The Nanny State Western nations embargo Iranian oil and wonder why the price is going up.

1161 2018-10-02 21:22:36 George Bush the Elder did the same thing. His father gave him half a million to invest in oil. He came out with half a million, which means that he lost money with inflation. And he lost money in OIL!

1170 2018-10-02 21:22:01 REMEMBER, Fred Koch created the Russian oil industry when NO OTHER oil company would.

He built the first refineries for Stalin.

That's where the family fortune originated.

1172 2018-10-02 21:21:53 How about a fetish for the smell of lumpy oil spills under cars, that's good right?
1173 2018-10-02 21:21:35 These analysts had once predicted $200 and what happened after that? Oil was at $20s.

1176 2018-10-02 21:21:28 hi friends, I have purchased some CBD oil. If you’ve used it, (especially for chronic insomnia), would really appreciate your recommendations/thoughts !
1177 2018-10-02 21:21:15 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
1178 2018-10-02 21:21:14 I've tried Liz Earle but doesn't help  I use a facemask from Lush called Cupcake (it's for teens lol) & it really draws out the oil.
1179 2018-10-02 21:21:12 Mdon's fries have 4 kinds of oil, salt, sugar, silly putty (nbd) and natural beef flavour... whatever that means LMAO
1180 2018-10-02 21:21:04 Nytimes writes great article on Trump tax fraud for 25 years. But we have the perfect film-flam man as president. Snake oil salesman, charlatan  Pull back the curtain ?? Not in our universe The wizard of oz is our president
1181 2018-10-02 21:20:59 Turmeric/Aloe/lemon. After you wash your face always use oils like Caster Oul or blackseed Oil (good for digestion and allergies).
1182 2018-10-02 21:20:26 Could probably make your own from CBD oil
1183 2018-10-02 21:20:23 Just published. 121,000 total. Broken down by states.  $50 million for 2years a drop in the ocean, and that's if it appears.  Morrison talks big. Not sure if he ever delivers. Snake oil salesman.
1184 2018-10-02 21:20:20 Thank you. I hope you're able to get ahold of your cbd oil. I have a feeling they will make it "legal" again when the weed shops open up. If they ever open. They just wanna be able to tax it. Ridiculous. Good luck. :-)
1185 2018-10-02 21:19:54 Try argan or rosehip oil
1186 2018-10-02 21:19:51 Attn England's Socialists, Scotland will do its part to rid us of Westminster Tories and brexit. It wont be with a Labour, cos well you know, pro brexit, anti indy ref and against indy, and well that whole "vote Tory" thing, oil and Trident.

Still love yous tho.

1193 2018-10-02 21:19:06 I suck at doing things I’m suppose to. I was suppose to do laundry today. Pack my hospital bag. Make a massage appointment so I can get my prenatal massage AND make an appointment at the car dealership for an oil change.. guess how many of those things i got done

1198 2018-10-02 21:18:13 Oh yeah! I was with him in the olive oil business, but that was a long time ago.

1201 2018-10-02 21:17:32 So its a greater good to have a leaking oil pipeline to this day, desecrate a hallowed Burial Ground? Who benefits most from the Pipeline being built actually shows Privilege, so thank you CDW. Have a nice day.
1202 2018-10-02 21:17:32 Frat boy? Lol wtf. I didn’t go to college and I work in the oil field. Gtfo. I’ll roast when when I get off WORK
1203 2018-10-02 21:16:57 We can keep the pound, we don't need oil, we have plenty other ways. You should read more about what we do have and think less negative thoughts

1211 2018-10-02 21:15:55 Oh no....... The oil got all under our huge ass friers and behind the sink where I can't really get it out. 
1212 2018-10-02 21:15:33 Life can change so quickly. 6 years ago I got arrested by my high school for selling weed. My mom told me I could never smoke weed again. But here we are, 6 years later. I’m stoned and my mom just texted me to make sure I don’t forget to give the dog his CBD oil medicine.

1215 2018-10-02 21:15:01 The @AP shouldn’t call snake oil salesmen offering the administration a thin veneer of respectability “scientific outliers.” Like scientists who say smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer or argue climate change isn’t man-made, they are quacks who are paid to lie for political cover.

1217 2018-10-02 21:14:39 Someone told me coconut oil and black soap works magic
1218 2018-10-02 21:14:08 Maybe because the 6 countries doing better don't have oil as an export resource and their climate is such that they don't need oil for heating
1219 2018-10-02 21:13:57 i could see "the guys" lifting at tobin's to midnight oil - beds are burning

Eisenhower was right about military industrial complex. My 2nd favorite Farewell Address after George Washington. 

We are still being harmed by evil Eisenhower did in Iran and Guatemala. USA nationalized industries WW1, WW2.

1268 2018-10-02 21:09:00 definitely see a specialist about it, and consult your doctor if you are on medication, cause they can have adverse effects together. I started taking cbd oil instead of my muscle relaxers cause it was knocking me out for 15+hours.. which isn't conducive to living lol
1269 2018-10-02 21:08:45 That can't be nearly as bad as oil. But I feel you. I feel you.

1273 2018-10-02 21:08:06 Sorry are you talking about the radical Islamists that the US created because we didn't like the democratically elected ruler of a country and purposefully aided in deposing that ruler so that we could have access to oil?

1278 2018-10-02 21:07:09 maybe they should ask the USA who committed/commits genocide on Timor for their OIL and GAS and West Papua for their gold AND Oil/GAS< BOTH countries have been overthrown by USA and Aus for corporations whove raped BILLIONS off the countries
1279 2018-10-02 21:07:04 Get some clove oil from a chemist and rub it on the tooth with a cotton bud
1280 2018-10-02 21:06:58 Did they loged protest in 14,15,16 when Merc used oil burn? No of course, cos everyone have they own interpretations of the rules...Thats why there is Fia..But why .Why did Merc qustion Ferrari Ers sistem claim it is illegela...
1281 2018-10-02 21:06:52 Oh jesus. I took a lot of CBD oil too which helped.
1282 2018-10-02 21:06:47 She made herself pathetic
1283 2018-10-02 21:06:46 I’m ready for a HOT bath .. the kind that makes you sweat, wine, fat blunt and a hot oil massage after.
1284 2018-10-02 21:06:40 so funny to me that the symbol of dallas is the old logo to an oil company. but imma shill that red pegasus til the day i die.
1285 2018-10-02 21:06:39 So here I am. Sitting in the line at the girls achool and scratched under my arm immediately, I smelled fish. So I'm like I know my arms not smelling like that. Next thing I know its major oil leaking from my car. Smfh
1286 2018-10-02 21:06:38 I used to use a food processor but now I just grate it and fry it in coconut oil or butter. Sometimes I add other bits too and some spices. I make a lot of cauliflower mash too which is equally lovely!
1287 2018-10-02 21:06:07 deep breaths lovely, listen to calming music and/or take a relaxing bath with a few drops of lavender oil in
1288 2018-10-02 21:05:48 2/ 4 Bay leafs - finely chopped mushroom- stir in more flour soak up oil. Don’t burn it! ( these are her recipes lol)

1291 2018-10-02 21:05:24 My roommate offered me CBD gummies last night which are basically edibles made with cannabinol oil that she got off amazon lol
1292 2018-10-02 21:05:21 In 1900, one third of cars in the USA were electric - today it is 1 percent.  Why did gasoline succeed?
Mass production made cars with combustion engine more affordable
Oil from the Texas also made gasoline cheap
A gas station infrastructure was significantly simpler to realize
1293 2018-10-02 21:05:07 I know how to change tires, oil battery, radiator, and headlights... who can say the same 
1294 2018-10-02 21:04:59 Do you expect Oil to send one of Bear or Bouchard down? Or do you seem them shipping out another forward such as Kassian or Caggiula?
1295 2018-10-02 21:04:51 The smell of castor oil takes me back to my childhood memories  Gogo forced us  to drink it  while she was holding a belt
1296 2018-10-02 21:04:51 Alaye  groudnut oil, is the best, very cheap (half bottle 50 naira).  Just take your bath and use it GBAM!! fine boy start niyen

1299 2018-10-02 21:04:01 Now Hear This !
This Republican Party has over 3 TRILLION DOLLARS stolen by G.W Bush

elections until these funds are surrendered to the U.S. Treasury !
This is the truth.

1302 2018-10-02 21:03:40 Truck driving is an extremely varied occupation and not just over the road transport. In the ten years I have left to work I won't be affected at all. Automation for what I do is decades off if ever.
1303 2018-10-02 21:03:36 I have a busy night. Have to get an oil change, drop packages off and a hair appt. I just want to sleep
1304 2018-10-02 21:03:34 I use a baby wipe to take my makeup off then micellar water to take off the extra dirt/oil, wash my face with just water and exfoliate once a week - my skin is usually dry but doing this my skin is perfffff

1306 2018-10-02 21:03:05 You sir, have never built ANYTHING with your own hands. You rely on the blood, sweat and money of others. You sir are a fraud, a con man, a snake oil salesman. You have fooled some of us, but not all. Many of us knew all along. You better hope they don't dig any deeper. #impeach

1315 2018-10-02 21:02:03 Mi-Jung we need to sell our oil to the world not just USA at such a low rate! Also, new type of energy source is forthcoming and we have to do it now before it is too late Mi-Jung! Enjoy Mi-Jung!

1319 2018-10-02 21:01:25 .@CNRLCareers, we know the truth about your decaying oil and gas wells. When will you create jobs in clean up and reclamation instead of mining and drilling? #abpoli #CleanItUp #polluterpays
1320 2018-10-02 21:01:24 Nope, and when you consider her TDS is so bad that Bill Kristol is a distant second, that’s sayin’ something
1321 2018-10-02 21:01:22 I corrected my tweet and used a more family-friendly term when referring to our Governor.  "The man who would destroy Florida's environment to make more millions from his oil investments. He too, is nothing but a self-righteous JERK."

1337 2018-10-02 20:59:18 You would have caved in the first two months.  Our auto industry would have been destroyed but Alberta's oil would have been flowing.

1340 2018-10-02 20:58:58 A good server will take a table full of sad people & have them laughing uproariously. They will overhear your friend say she's on the FODMAP diet & know they can't have garlic They will check the label of the "olive oil" themselves to make sure there's no soy, not trust the cook.
1341 2018-10-02 20:58:52 They were lying from the beginning. Snake oil salesmen. I still can't believe they convinced so many people. Like the young lady on Question Time 'annoyed' that she was lied to by Leave spokesmen and who now wants a second ref. I don't have a great deal of sympathy.
1342 2018-10-02 20:58:32 Got my truck alignment done, tires rotated, and oil changed. Feeling like a broke adult

1375 2018-10-02 20:52:37 Yep, AAM is a dealmaker. Also, offering a hostage to fortune, given these appointments, seems to me the lines over main ministries not going to change much, if at all. Have some thoughts on potential wrinkles on oil issues re KRG-Baghdad, bit that's maybe secondary.
1376 2018-10-02 20:52:31 Good grief get a friggin job. I make over 100 grand a year driving a stupid truck. Nearly anyone could do it.
1377 2018-10-02 20:52:28 It's also based on the assumption that voracious capitalists in India, China, etc will out of altruism opt to forgo cheap, abundant fuel (oil + coal) in favour of LNG from here, rather than just add LNG to the mix or use it to replace expensive renewables.

1390 2018-10-02 20:50:51 I have taken some science courses in college and am entitled to my opinion. Interesting how you don't mention wind, solar, or hydro. Humans survived long before coal, oil, gas or nuclear energy. I think we should learn to live with less: conserve & become more efficient.
1391 2018-10-02 20:50:49 But while in the shower, we use things like soap, sponges (I personally always use a sponge with soap) so the dead skin and oil come out, and all the dirtiness...  We are all clean after a shower, so... Right?! Or are you being sarcastic, Mr Pimentel? Love ya!

1393 2018-10-02 20:50:38 Millions without healthcare, oil at $75 a barrel, deficit exploded which means are children get to pay for it etc etc. the good times never last, slow and steady should be the motto.
1394 2018-10-02 20:50:27 The USO is a poor vehicle to trade oil. One is much better off with the futures or with energy stocks.

1398 2018-10-02 20:49:31 I agree.. the country doesn’t even allow private developers to develop small communities / suburbs. Mostly because the Oil Ministry resists it lest there is an oil reserve underneath.. extremely slow infrastructure provision by state agencies
1399 2018-10-02 20:49:17 It blows my mind. We rent a four bedroom house for just over half that amount, and it’s not like there’s nothing to do here?!?! Although granted not sure we have cannabis oil boutiques yet so maybe it’s that idk

1414 2018-10-02 20:47:11 She pouted slightly, rolling onto her side and propping her head up with her hand, her elbow resting on the pillow.

"That depends." Was her reply, reaching out to wipe a small streak of oil from his cheek. "Can I join you?"

1417 2018-10-02 20:46:42 Oh, with “spice nuts” and “oil balls” I’m more than covered on the goodies front. 

The traditional Dutch Christmas carbs could use a marketer from Mars Co. though….

1419 2018-10-02 20:46:28 We are going without lids on hot drinks for the next couple days to raise awareness about plastic pollution! Also be sure to check out our iced drinks which are plant based oil plastic cups and lids which are compostable
1420 2018-10-02 20:46:18 The lady who did my feet was like oh you take care of your feet good , uh yes mam. Pedis on the regular and oil to the feet after every shower ... & I don’t walk around bare foot lmao
1421 2018-10-02 20:46:15 Just curious.... how many of my friends use CBD oil? I’m a believer!
1422 2018-10-02 20:46:09 A few years ago around this time they were advertising that their Pumpkin Spice oil changes were back. Their marketing team is pretty good
1423 2018-10-02 20:45:47 We are the biggest producer of oil in the world! We can raise the price and lower it anytime we please!!
1424 2018-10-02 20:45:41 white wine vinegar & honey mustard with a bit of oil, salt and pepper, might actually be my new fav salad dressing as weird as it sounds 
1425 2018-10-02 20:45:33 Couldn’t possibly choose! Played Century Spice Road, Codenames Duet, Mondrian, Sagrada, Snake Oil, and the Mind just this week!

1427 2018-10-02 20:45:16 I haven’t been drinking water like I usually do and I skipped on lunch. I took a pain pill from my foot injury but it hasn’t kicked in yet. I think it’s more stress than anything haha I’ve been thinking about getting an oil defuser for my desk but I don’t know. Does it help?

1429 2018-10-02 20:45:02 Can anyone tell me why my brain decided to remind me of the time I had a legit argument with someone I was seeing over the fact that I was not about to use coconut oil as lube but I literally cant even remember who it was
1430 2018-10-02 20:45:00 Unless I get rich, I'll probably drive a Honda for the rest of my life. Literally all I do is change the oil, rotate/change the tires and put gas in
1431 2018-10-02 20:44:48 I totally disagree. If #OPEC agrees to pump more, Russia will also start boosting supply. Outcome of this challenge will show if Trump admin policies in oil sector will prove right or wrong in 2019 as well.
1432 2018-10-02 20:44:40 Have you ever seen the oil drop off a peanut?!

1438 2018-10-02 20:43:48 Dad replied, "It's a crop whose pungent oil is often promoted as a really useless substitute for olive oil. It retains too much heat and has none of the distinctive flavour of extra virgin. Talking of which, ask your sister when you join her in the basement later."
1439 2018-10-02 20:43:40 Petro for a barrel of Venezuelan oil? :-)  I know, terrible example. Wish it were a legitimate offering. But the core idea is a good one.
1440 2018-10-02 20:43:29 If you don’t change your own oil, can’t change a flat tire, and “or” wear skinny pants you shouldn’t be allowed by law to grow a beard.

1442 2018-10-02 20:43:10 I take CBD oil & Curamin for my neuropathy & fibromyalgia pain, & use a Quell device (@Quellrelief).  No more prescriptions or over-the-counter meds. I’m finally getting my life back! Zero side effects (unlike what I had with gabapentin & other meds). Good luck!
1443 2018-10-02 20:42:59 Its just that we do export 2 million barrels of oil per day. Otherwise GDP would be up there.

1446 2018-10-02 20:42:44 Going on a trip only 5 weeks after surgery. Believe me, if I could afford it, i'd go in a heartbeat. A lot of the rainforest where orangutans live has been cut down for palm oil farms. Orangs needed rescuing, very sad pix of babies roaming the non forest, looking 4 mom
1447 2018-10-02 20:42:40 Cbd oil is now illegal in Ohio. And its very expensive. I think they outlawed it maybe a month ago?

1454 2018-10-02 20:41:49 Yesterday I passed a Jiffy Lube that was advertising itself as the "Unofficial Oil Change Provider of the NFL" and I've thought a lot about that since.
1455 2018-10-02 20:41:45 Why is it that in the kitchen, ground nut oil finish before palm oil? 
1456 2018-10-02 20:41:37 Normally I don't give a flying f*&k who sleeps with who so long as it was consensual. But when Sir Misogyny the Orange hitches his wagon of deplorables to that of the evangelical religious right, I start giving a f*&k as it shows he's nothing more than a snake oil salesman.

1468 2018-10-02 20:40:47 I remember from one of Dan Browns previous books when R Langdon made reference to how Christians act of revering a cross and using oil and communion would be somewhat funny if it were a practice of another religion. It actually opened my eye about perspective.

1480 2018-10-02 20:39:34 Ur govt increased tax on oil when in intl market oil prices were below $40. U cant stop lying its wat do u. its wat u tell ur children to do as well? To be liars?
1481 2018-10-02 20:39:30 Partially true. Remember U.S. steel, carbon, oil, good for Europa. People in German and Austro-hungarian Empire haven't food. Think only Army operations are  a little point of wiew.
1482 2018-10-02 20:39:29 What I do know is that you can't treat malnutrition with that salad, unless you add plenty of oil based salad dressing. Bread with plenty of butter.. lots of energy!

1491 2018-10-02 20:37:52 Prosecutors can’t just investigate what they want to hoping to strike oil. They have to have probable cause that a crime has been committed. These acts are outside the SOL so they’re not really crimes anymore. You can’t just say “he did THAT so let’s just keep digging”.

1502 2018-10-02 20:36:51 No, I see beyond the simplistic and look at the bigger picture. Steel tariffs, for example, help steel workers... but there are far more industries that USE steel. More expensive steel hurts construction, automakers, oil & gas, etc.

1566 2018-10-02 20:30:15 What is happening is beyond belief. I wish I could be the bearer of good news but the PF have boxed us into a mess and there is worse to come. Yes the dollar is stronger and crude oil prices have risen but reckeless spending and corruption have made a bad situation worse.
1567 2018-10-02 20:30:15 MAGA.

Oil prices rose after the United States, Canada and Mexico announced they had agreed on a path forward for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. 

$100 a barrel oil now looks possible, if not inevitable.

1575 2018-10-02 20:28:23 why arent refiners requesting waivers to buy cheaper oil? Any reason why? thx in advance

1578 2018-10-02 20:27:56 Aberdeen is suffering from the oil price collapse, 'tis true. However, we will flourish and Ireland would be well-advised to get out the EU ASAP.

1584 2018-10-02 20:27:09 Was just a comment on his recent complaints about the Opec countries not making oil lower priced. One other thing to consider is the ramp up in military hostilities in the gulf. Oil may go higher near term which may stifle economic activity. = Trump not happy ;)

1586 2018-10-02 20:27:00 It is certainly not the case when you are dancing salsa⁈The country has collapsed, but crude oil prices are likely to rise in the future...
1587 2018-10-02 20:26:49 Not if what you’re spending on saves money in the long run. That’s the major problem with conservative fiscal theory. It’s like someone who decides to save money by not changing their oil. Then, of course, they end up spending more than they saved when their engine blows.
1588 2018-10-02 20:26:38 Ya ever look at cars on Facebook marketplace and the description is like “needs either an oil change or a new engine” like uhhh those are two wildly different things bud I’m gonna need some clarification
1589 2018-10-02 20:26:36 And that's Big Oil! What's next Conservatives ?
1590 2018-10-02 20:26:16 Nope! I do very very occasionally use squalene oil if I feel like I need it but other than that I’ll double cleanse to take make up off, then a toner and in the morning after cleansing I use a B cosmetics hyaluronic acid face spray before make up.

1608 2018-10-02 20:24:23 I have noticed as you go down the cap ladder you are seeing less & less response to higher oil price. But what this does do, is allow one to invest in a hated marginal intl deep value micro-cap having confidence that they will survive. Thank you for your encouraging words.

1619 2018-10-02 20:23:09 2017/18 oil revenues were over £1bn at an average of $55 a barrel, 2018/19 prices should average $75+ and production is up with more to come on. You won’t get the figures til the end of the financial year. North Sea taxes likely to go up at this rate currently 30% on profits...

1635 2018-10-02 20:21:30 The West & America are destroying an entire nation( Arab nation) ,stealing its goods, mony,oil and then claiming that their emotions can not bear to see a wounded  child.

There is no free energy, and nuclear waste is well-managed. There would be more coal if there was no nuclear energy. And there will be more coal, gas, and oil if nuclear energy isn't considered moving forward.

1656 2018-10-02 20:19:20 There is definitely a snake oil approach in some of the systems I've seen. People want answers & are willing to pay. There are no shortage of people willing to make a profit off the mental health of first responders. Simplicity & validation are key to any solution.

1674 2018-10-02 20:17:39 Yeah that’s going to be hard for Russia to do when we are squatting on most of the oil.  I think that’s another reason we are staying.  Force them to drain their money then they will have no choice but to talk. That’s what Russia went after in Feb. when we had to light em up.

1744 2018-10-02 20:09:37 A week is normal for a breastfed baby. If he’s happy and not fussing then he’s not in pain. You can try taking a Qtip with a little Vaseline or coconut oil and rubbing it around the inside of his butt hole gently. It will help stimulate pooping
1745 2018-10-02 20:09:26 Love seeing my childhood favorites hobble out of retirement so that some Saudi oil money prince can relive the 90's.

1755 2018-10-02 20:08:42 Medical weed is honestly the only thing that has helped my night terrors and insomnia. When I use it, I wake much more ready and capable to face stuff instead of being awash in anxiety and short tempered.
Oil can help similarly.
1756 2018-10-02 20:08:30 White house policy on climate change- yes globe will warm up 7F acid seas will kill coral reefs, polar cap will melt Manhattan under water. Humans can't do anything , so let's not try and use more coal, oil etc all whose CEOs are friends of Trump and fund him!

1760 2018-10-02 20:08:00 *claps hands together* ho boy okay there’s about a million reasons why medicinal marijuana or CBD oil is better, HOWEVER: you have to make sure you’ll react to them properly. If you’re going to go this route, you have to make sure whatever you’re getting is-
1761 2018-10-02 20:07:59 CBD oil really helps with anxiety like it's a miracle
1762 2018-10-02 20:07:51 Doesn’t the US support this guy with oil and gas deals?
1763 2018-10-02 20:07:49 We seems to forget that economic problems have economic answers . The west never went to prayers when they were faced with Economic Crisis of 2008 nor do the Arabs head the mosque to pray when oil prices are down.
1764 2018-10-02 20:07:28 US is fucking this country becayse it does not want to sell its oil in dollars. Just like russia, iran, libua etc...

1770 2018-10-02 20:06:58 He's such a con artist.  a former friend talks about what a brilliant business man he is.   Just a broke snake oil salesman indebted to Russia
1771 2018-10-02 20:06:58 India doesn’t pay for Iranian oil in USD though and last time Iran was sanctioned they had resorted to procuring other goods and services in lieu of payments for oil
1772 2018-10-02 20:06:58 The time for action was 10+ years ago when *checks notes* the US was busy setting up oil companies in Iraq
1773 2018-10-02 20:06:52 Kind of ironic given that Norway produces oil.
1774 2018-10-02 20:06:46 *Who Paid The Piper?*

Deep pockets of dark money! It won't work in the end but this is pocket change to try and slow things down. Same with climate FUD
1785 2018-10-02 20:05:18 Oil prices at the highest since 2014
1786 2018-10-02 20:05:12 Exactly. This wave should extend to every single business in the country, raising overall costs of goods and services at an even greater rate. For reference see @THEHermanCain explain pizza business to @BillClinton
1787 2018-10-02 20:05:08 Then why only Ferrari is fitted with sensor? Why where they acused for oil burn, to remove bag from the cam...When Merc was 1st team to start with...Why they dont go and check Merc rear wing which apparently is flexing?
1788 2018-10-02 20:04:55 #Budget2019 Recent rises in Heating oil , Gas ,Petrol +Diesel , Coal , Insurance not to mention rents means Donohue will have to give everyone about 40e a week just to stand still so its going to cost the Irish Tory party a fortune to buy votes in the next election .
1789 2018-10-02 20:04:48 As an aside from the regions point - the UK is a Norman colony. A surprising number of the same aristocrats are still in charge.
 London's wealth was partly built on the resources plundered from the regions: Coal from Wales and the North East, North Sea Oil.

1795 2018-10-02 20:03:20 I dunno about the EI rate comment. I’m on the east coast & haven’t ever availed of EI, but I do know that Alberta oil would stay in the ground if not for Canadians from the east coast. Conservatives from across this great country need to unite and avoid such “low blow” comments.

1822 2018-10-02 19:59:28 Well China is one of a kind even when in past it faced massive corruption, bad governance, rising population in fact the most populous and other than that not even rich in minerals or oil, which was one of the most important commodity when China began it's upward journey
1823 2018-10-02 19:58:57 Newly elected #Iraq president Barham Salih formally asks Adil Abdul Mahdi to form the next government. A decent candidate for PM but only if he doesn't go in with his resignation letter in his pocket! He didn't finish his previous terms as Vice Pres or oil minister.
1824 2018-10-02 19:58:55 Temporarily.... E go sell like crude oil soon
1825 2018-10-02 19:58:50 Bikes, who are roundly rejected by almost ever local papers editorial section, has a lobby. Oil, according to these same conspiracists (word?), does not.

1827 2018-10-02 19:58:41 I hate getting anything out of the oven. I have a minor cardiac arrest whenever I heat the oil for my roast potatoes and having to take the smoking oil out. Worst thing to drop ever.

1829 2018-10-02 19:58:38 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1830 2018-10-02 19:58:35 It was found at a local gas station. Which is why it shocked me! I use CBD oil from Bluegrass Hemp Oil.
1831 2018-10-02 19:58:33 And oil not giving a fuck about generally anything atm
1832 2018-10-02 19:58:11 sounds like a good part 2 for oil on water
1833 2018-10-02 19:58:01 Point 2- Next OIL REFINERIES. These use Abserloutely staggering amounts of power, as much as a small town just to convert from into petrol. Far more than is needed to make batteries etc needed for EVs.
1834 2018-10-02 19:57:51 it's true, I'd eat shredded drywall if you put soy sauce, sesame oil, and sriracha on it.
1835 2018-10-02 19:57:51 @drsanjaygupta my son with Severe Autism, has been taking CBD oil, it is helping with behaviors. If it's not legal at the national level, can I take in on a plane?
1836 2018-10-02 19:57:49 Point 1 - Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car.
1837 2018-10-02 19:57:48 all you need is the oil filter, air filter and motor oil bro easy shit. drain pan HIGHLY recommended to avoid a mess

1840 2018-10-02 19:57:19 Then how do you explain the fact that the government cannot import parts for their oil rigs? Or how do you explain that the government cannot import medicine?  How do you explain that the state-owned TelSur was prohibited from paying journalist @AbbyMartin?

1842 2018-10-02 19:57:12 I’m thinking I might just have to! I just hate paying for oil 
1843 2018-10-02 19:57:05 Markets. Rising rates = money moving into commodities/productive assets? See oil, nat gas, gold. Still long Tech+Commodities.
1844 2018-10-02 19:56:54 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

1852 2018-10-02 19:56:08 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Ppl complain cuz it gets them coupons/discounts. If Corp didn’t compensate complaints with coupons that number would drop substantially.

1854 2018-10-02 19:55:55 I'll give @jahimes apiculture.  I would welcome a debate with @jahimes on oil markets.  Unfortunately he will not agree.  At least he is smart enough to know I would school him.

1857 2018-10-02 19:55:40 all you think is we have just oil to depend on? Seriously! The fact that emphasis are based on oil doesn't mean we are not diverse. u only see what u choose to see &if we have a good leader today, it will take less than a year to be the Giants that we really are in all ramificatn

1868 2018-10-02 19:54:09 @StatiSense, please note that crude oil price at the highest since November 2014. Crude oil approaches $82/barrel as US sanctions on IRAN tightens supply.
1869 2018-10-02 19:53:59 Evangelists are Calvinists. Who's theology is surrounded by predestiny. A system that rewards the rich, while rejecting the poor and the sick.

Ironically Calvinists used to be the leaders in science. 

Now they are the purveyors of snake oil and calling it "creationism"

1876 2018-10-02 19:53:18 And as we already covered , every time you used that engine from 1969-2018 more oil has to be mined daily. I would also point out that Lithium and battery parts can be recycled at end, but petrol once burned is lost for good
1877 2018-10-02 19:53:14 CBD is not the drug. THC is. CBD has all the same good qualities. You can buy it in oil form online.
1878 2018-10-02 19:53:12 Yo i hella fucked up i bought trail mix cuz i was starving waiting on this oil change but there was a taco truck right outside
1879 2018-10-02 19:52:35 Let's get blunter: Excluding big oil's proganada of non belief, religion holds most of the personal deniers of global warming. That sort of human thinking can get so insane, they embrace armageddon by nuclear fallout or severe climate change. "Bring it on, I'm going to Heaven."
1880 2018-10-02 19:52:22 A back massage with a warm essential oil would be lovely.

1885 2018-10-02 19:51:55 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
1886 2018-10-02 19:51:50 I have always paid $40 for an oil change and all of a sudden it’s like $80. Is this just an Atlanta thing or???? This isn’t fair. I’m about to cry.
1887 2018-10-02 19:51:49 The garlic oil I’ve just slathered my pizza in is so nice I’m now drinking it neat.
1888 2018-10-02 19:51:48 I completely agree! Every year its getting more expensive, and its all needless tat! If you dont have kids, put your money in the oil tank/electric/food etc and have a warm and homely Christmas with some financial security! China is not going to be happy with this movement!

1893 2018-10-02 19:51:29 It is because we sell our oil to the US at about $25 a barrel compared to what we could get if we had a pipeline to the west and east coast
1894 2018-10-02 19:51:28 I just sold it :( but I did a lot of research on it, i listened to the manual and the oil life monitoring system. Once it hit 10% I changed it.
1895 2018-10-02 19:51:24 I think you need to qualify your statements that "socialism" implicitly referring to venezuelan oil is bad for venezuelans, because as it stands its absolutely unqualified libel.

1900 2018-10-02 19:51:04 Pour oil in pot, cover it, set your timer for 4 minutes, turn off, do not open, allow to cool, start cooking.
1901 2018-10-02 19:50:58 But they told me with me put oil on top of bad oil it busted/burned my pipes. Something like that. And it cause an oil leak as well. So any oil I was putting in was coming right out.
1902 2018-10-02 19:50:55  that’s why it’s called oil CHANGE. you have to CHANGE the oil. not add more to it  i’m weak. but then it’s not funny that you don’t have a car...but still lol
1903 2018-10-02 19:50:52 One way is an increase in taxes. More marginal is an overall increase in costs of goods and services which will compound the more this grows.
1904 2018-10-02 19:50:45 just finished my first ever oil painting and I’ve never been so happy in my life!!!!!! time for a celebratory NAP!!
1905 2018-10-02 19:50:32 But why would Tobacco and Oil companies fund a magazine that seems  intent on publishing outcry from disgraced scientists? 
1906 2018-10-02 19:50:27 locals don’t understand the idea wiping oil/dirt off of their camera or not using a case that obscures their camera quality to that of a Ninentendo DS
1907 2018-10-02 19:50:20 Sounds like hinge oil lol
1908 2018-10-02 19:50:08 I was just extrapolating the concept of enjoying watching people suffer while waiting to acquire goods they need (a strange predilection to me, but there’s no accounting for taste).  We could go with gas lines during the oil embargo in the 70s if you want to ease into the waters.
1909 2018-10-02 19:49:56 They did tell me. So I just put oil in it. I thought that’s what it meant.  I swear I’m so dumb when it comes to car. If it had nothing to do it’s gas or windshield wiper fluid I don’t have a clue.
1910 2018-10-02 19:49:54 Haha you will all have to make a wee parade video like the boys on the oil rig 
1911 2018-10-02 19:49:54 There’s some at most drug stores. Just google which one u need for which type of bug bite. Put a drop or two in oil or lotion.
1912 2018-10-02 19:49:48 Russia is supposed to get the bulk of the oil revenue from the NE. This doesn’t sit well with Iran.
1913 2018-10-02 19:49:46 Oil revenues goes to the oil companies that extract the oil , U.K. Revenue comes from the tax charged keeping in mind , low oil prices = low tax revenue. If SNP tell you otherwise you need to broaden your list of who you trust !

1922 2018-10-02 19:48:51 I would argue that the oil industry has funded anti-science and fake data to muddy the waters (proven) turning something that should have been bipartisan, political.
1923 2018-10-02 19:48:47 Claire Perry You hypocrite! At best you are purely ignorant and carrying out the orders of your puppet master Greg Clarke, worst in the pocket of the oil/gas companies and conniving to increase the wealth of a few individuals at the expense of the climate.

1930 2018-10-02 19:48:16 Are you actually changing the oil yourself? Lol
1931 2018-10-02 19:48:15 Also if the govt want to provide quality food then it should give oil, dal, vegetables etc also in subsidized price. 
By the way #Odisha is the topper of graduation level unemployment rate in India.

Now fuck off back under the Anichkov bridge.
1933 2018-10-02 19:48:11 Actually gov benefits collectively the most.
More tax revenue to Medicare,  social security, fed/state income taxes.  But it's good they got the raise and in one sense will put more into the collective pot.

1960 2018-10-02 19:46:06 Girl when it comes to cars I’m seriously dumb. I thought if I just kept putting oil in it. It didn’t matter. So I just kept putting oil in top of bad oil.
1961 2018-10-02 19:46:02  you do realise you just called us shorters when we clearly arent  ask a question your instantly a shorter good one . Suppose me being invested and reeping from ukog producing more and more oil makes me a shorter too?
1962 2018-10-02 19:46:00 #Turkmenistan announced will end #naturalgas, #electricity and water #subsidies. Energy producers should take advantage of the high #oil price to phase out domestic subsidies, which lead to high consumption and thus high pollution and health consequences,  and benefit the rich.

1966 2018-10-02 19:45:31 When a farmer says “ there’s plenty of insects ...you should see all the flea beetle on my oil seed rape “  
I think of it in the same way as a climate change denier saying “ how come it’s snowing ?  I thought the planet was getting warmer “.

1969 2018-10-02 19:45:19 The attack on @JeffFlake is an attempt to shame him into personally accepting responsibility for the individual event the protestor alleges. He nor 320 million Americans minus 1 are responsible. 
Anyone rejecting this premise becomes a target of the left.

1977 2018-10-02 19:44:54 How remarkable is it that the value of the Fiat Currency's around the world have "lost real value" and has been "diluted by the cost" of Oil price and Gold price inflationary effects.
1978 2018-10-02 19:44:46 Oil is not the only contributing factor here. It's the laws. Low regulation, low taxes, & no state tax. Do YOU live here?
1979 2018-10-02 19:44:44 Anything really that I can do. I'm a veteran and did police and jet mechanic work there, and since 2006 I've been an Industrial safety supervisor in the Oil Industry.

1988 2018-10-02 19:43:29 Seems like a whole lot of us are introducing ourselves to this fine snake oil salesman.
1989 2018-10-02 19:43:27 Oil prices rise to its highest since November 2014. 
1990 2018-10-02 19:43:25 I was on it for RLS and neuropathy.  It made me groggy, and time/tolerance didn't make a difference.  What did my neurosurgeon switch me to?  Medical marijuana.  No kidding.  I use the oil sublingually, and it works great!
1991 2018-10-02 19:43:23 Roast them! Hom nom nom. Give them a wash. Chop off the stalks leaving a few cm, then drizzle with olive oil,roast 45min at 180, maybe bit longer if they're big ones!
1992 2018-10-02 19:43:12 Ahaha I haven't seen any yet! I've been attacking my window sil with Eucalyptus oil because they don't like the smell and it makes them stay away 
1993 2018-10-02 19:43:04 Exactly how long does it take to bleach oil? Is this what you people do on a regular? 
1994 2018-10-02 19:42:53 One of my fav meals that maybe will be ok for your current diet?
- rub a chicken breast with a spice mix of a bit of oil, paprika, garlic, pepper, salt, cayenne, and grill it
- also grill some asparagus w lemon and pepper
- serve w a cous cous and chilli flakes, some greek yogurt

1996 2018-10-02 19:42:34 What was your first essential oil and why did you get it?

My first was lavender. I begged my mom when I was 12 to get me some for an aromatherapy necklace so I could sleep better.
1997 2018-10-02 19:42:17 I’m sure US is trying desperately to convince India that they can supply oil cheaper than Iran can
1998 2018-10-02 19:42:04 I think we are already on the verge
1999 2018-10-02 19:42:02 Hahaha  secretly hoping she applys carrot oil

2008 2018-10-02 19:41:25 Fraud Con man Trump. So many lawsuits for people he’s screwed over. Countless sham businesses and lawsuits. The dude is a complete blow hard narcissistic snake oil salesman. I feel bad for the Magats who still blindly believe in his bs.
2009 2018-10-02 19:41:15 I got olbas oil in my eye and my hot water bottle is no longer warm so tonight is truly the absolute pits
2010 2018-10-02 19:41:13 I thought they used rapeseed oil? That link says soy oil.
2011 2018-10-02 19:41:13 No, Charles, they are quite different cases. If an oil tanker runs aground or is holed, the devastation to our oceans and our shores will last for decades. If an LNK tanker has an accident, the devastation will last about 10 seconds.

2015 2018-10-02 19:40:54 Done that!

In France this summer we hit a chip pan that someone had chucked into the middle of the dual carriageway, and it got stuck right underneath. I found, to my cost, it still had chip oil in it!

2024 2018-10-02 19:40:06 That's only the economy which need I remind you is 90% oil and gas for Nigeria. That means that will have rich few and poor many. Hence recently decared poverty capital. Kleptocracy
2025 2018-10-02 19:39:54 Releasing oil from the SPR has never resulted in sustained lower gas prices. It’s farcical, but that’s Trump for you.
2026 2018-10-02 19:39:50 There's so much compromat on this guy he'll dance (badly, but still) to whatever tune his owners play. Look at Big Oil and gutting of EPA, as well as new leg re: State's rights vis-a-vis indicting/trying Presidential pardons.

2031 2018-10-02 19:39:09 I do see a collective responsibility to unequivocally reject injustice, violence or abuse of any kind. 
The position of the left seems to be that we all must be forced individially AND collectively to accept blame and if we dont, we are even more culpable.
2032 2018-10-02 19:39:03 Thanks so much for putting this out. When I went to the video it was a PA Governor debate.

2045 2018-10-02 19:37:21 SA’s oil reserves are depleting extremely rapidly and the US’s reserves are largely untapped; you are delusional and foolish.

2047 2018-10-02 19:37:02 Because oil companies have a little extra money to finish up projects on the books.
What the NDP won't admit is that equity money won't get near Alberta until Notley is gone. So until then it's a mini oil price induced blip.

2053 2018-10-02 19:36:18 @dpradhanbjp 
Respected minister of petroleum,

Did you ever tried or put any effort to get the fuel prices lower by reducing the state and central taxes.

Where the common man is paying more tax than base crude oil price.

2064 2018-10-02 19:35:00 I don't think there has been a major spill, sinking of one of those LNG super tankers to look at, sure it's not oil but for sure it would cause massive ecological damage plus there has never been a major spill by Canadian shippers along the coast - we can do both safe

2072 2018-10-02 19:34:10 I think that's a reaction to our proposed senate bill to make pricing pressure by cartels like OPEC illegal in our country now that you are privatizing oil. He won't be mad. Both of our leaders think of everything lol. They'll work it out.

2103 2018-10-02 19:30:58 lol when even the Fraser Institute is releasing reports stating that projects like yours are unlikely to go forward under the AB oil sands emissions cap, you know you're doomed. #RejecttTeck

2115 2018-10-02 19:29:50 Read Charlie and the chocolate factory and accept that billions of parents have gone through this. Gina Ford is snake oil. Life goes on and in 6 months you will have forgotten this ever happened - how else do people decide to have more than one?
2116 2018-10-02 19:29:48 Wash your face once in a while. The light reflects off the oil and it is blinding.

2118 2018-10-02 19:29:45 I'm protest oil?
2119 2018-10-02 19:29:44 based on comments I hear, I think ppl don’t realize that a government provides services based on revenue from taxation. That’s the basics. We’ve been using rents from oil and gas to paper over our leaky tax income bucket and waste from corruption & inefficiency.

2123 2018-10-02 19:29:17 I guess the super tankers from Alaska and Russia that travel along the north coast then threw the same Canadian sea as the southern orca and then dock at cherry point in Washington state are risk free, it's just tankers that have Canadian oil that are bad

2133 2018-10-02 19:28:06 I’m around for makeup questions every day! Ive never found success with mattefying primers and have since been hydrating my skin more so it doesn’t overproduce oil and has a nice base for makeup 
2134 2018-10-02 19:28:01 U know what the funny part is? Thier still shipping oil by train which is way more dangerous for the environment than pipelines. This whole mess is political and part of sock boys dreams of sunny days an unicorns. Pure bs we sell dirt cheap an buy back at outrageous price.
2135 2018-10-02 19:27:57 Okay let's take the opposite approach... Even if there's no Climate danger like you guys think. Oil is still finite and less efficient than other tech. It should be replaced like we did with gaslight and Horse and Buggys.

2148 2018-10-02 19:26:06 Did anyone expect anything different? These are the types of people who voted in "Grab her by the pussy" "cheated on all 3 wives" snake oil salesman. They have no morals. They only claim moral high ground when it's convenient.

2159 2018-10-02 19:24:25 While I am extremely excited to see Canada moving forward  with this LNG  export project; all levels of Government, provincial and federal, should remain deeply concerned with heavy oil differentials that are topping US$40/bbl today.

2166 2018-10-02 19:23:24 But you can't put crude oil in cars. You only get +/- 70 litres of petrol from a barrel of crude oil.
2167 2018-10-02 19:23:01 attorney statement that professional considerations require termination of the representation oil nearly should be accepted as sufficient difficult to me being counted if the withdrawal is based on the client's demand that the attorney engage n unprofessional conduct

2182 2018-10-02 19:21:08 @potus After watching oil prices for years our economy does best with oil between 50 dollars and 70 dollars per barrel. It is too high now and going in the wrong direction

And on legislation to address big oil and global warming. And bills to give tax cuts to the wealthy. And on health care for all...

2201 2018-10-02 19:18:37 If facts matter, won’t “big oil & gas” just pass along the cost of “their” pollution to consumers? Isn’t that what a carbon price is? Isn’t it really the consumer’s pollution as the end purchaser? I’m for a carbon price but your tweet is as misleading as the GOP’s

2204 2018-10-02 19:18:23 @potus
The price of oil is going up because of OPEC, and certain temporary geopolitical reasons coupled with the dramatic growth. A release  from the strategic oil reserve can keep us going while bridging the current gap.
2205 2018-10-02 19:18:20 It's no irresponsible to do so, rather it's irresponsible to not recognize the severity of the issue in both parties. I just did a rather quick review of direct oil and gas donations or obvious interests to Dem state legislators. It's not pretty. No one bothers to research them.

2241 2018-10-02 19:15:28 Trump cheered by contractors  for restarting Keystone pipeline and other oil and gas projects. Applause for highway project speed up. ‘Beautiful clean Pa. Coal’ doesnt’ get cheers. ‘Fake news media’ gets laugh.

2247 2018-10-02 19:15:05 Doctor, muy bonita historia pero lo que nos interesa es que se haga justicia. Extraditen a Toledo! Denuncien a Humala! Denuncien a Villarán! Denuncien a PPK por lo de Odebrecht y tambien por Hunt Oil (gas de Camisea)! Que esperan???
2248 2018-10-02 19:14:53 @potus

Since we are producing so much oil and gas can you release at least a small amount of the crude oil reserve to ease the price crunch? We can replace when the price goes down if needed.
2249 2018-10-02 19:14:52 I’ve seen on Internet that smoking .32 gr cannabis = 1.5kg of CO2 , but no one has ever mentioned it.  Time to stop attacks on oil industry and defund the green machine.

2263 2018-10-02 19:13:33 "The IPCC estimates that to have a 50% of avoiding a 2 degree rise of temperature, we cannot emit more than 1100 gigatonnes. Any plausible pathway to this means the oil sands need to remain in the ground" -@bronwentucker #RejectTeck
2264 2018-10-02 19:13:30 One bright spot for Canada, they export tar sands oil to Texas to refine and Texans will be stuck with the petroleum coke byproduct  waste.

2278 2018-10-02 19:12:21 Just wait until we get away from using any oil from your country, and at the same time have no more troops there to help with the lawlessness. The Middle East will be a wasteland.

2284 2018-10-02 19:11:23 So does $1-2 Billion to get to an FID sound about right? Would it be similar % of total cost for an oil pipeline? In the context of repeatedly delayed oil pipelines, companies make it sound higher.
2285 2018-10-02 19:11:15 Adding palm oil will make it look like sacrifice and it's not sacrifice, it's noodles with locust beans.
2286 2018-10-02 19:11:15 My wife, Michele reminded me about a woman she met in the Canada Day Parade in Kitimat in 2016. Her husband worked away in the oil and gas industry and really wanted LNG Canada so he could come home. Today she and the entire area got their wish.
2287 2018-10-02 19:11:15 proposed change could lead to higher levels of exposure for workers at nuclear installations and oil and gas drilling sites, medical workers doing X-rays and CT scans, people living next to Superfund sites and any members of the public who one day might find themselves exposed...

2294 2018-10-02 19:10:39 Do they cause oil spills?
2295 2018-10-02 19:10:38 I have tried to explain to her before. Especially after the article stating our ‘palm oil’ resources while not mentioning 95% of Cameroon crude oil is in the region. I think a reporter in yde is feeding her some BS because otherwise she’s a highly regarded journalist.

2381 2018-10-02 19:01:23 Another GOP in Pennsylvania that refuses to meet with constituents. Drink that trump swamp oil. You want/need all that lobby money to vote against your constituents.
2382 2018-10-02 19:01:14 2 part ? here. Did Avenatti invent boofing? Did Johnathan Turley check his "oil" at George Washington?
2383 2018-10-02 19:01:13 Oh, absolutely. It has that pre oil crisis, aerodynamics - pa! - look about it. It's also approximately the size of my house. Still beautiful though...
2384 2018-10-02 19:01:13 The government of St. Lucia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Joel Madden in a beta cloth wig.
2385 2018-10-02 19:01:10 Get this oil change since I’m up here
2386 2018-10-02 19:01:08 07-08 no shale and fear on peak oil.  In about 5 years we’ll be right back there again if not sooner.  Only one bullet in that SPR gun.  Trump will use it for his term and not let other Presidents touch it.

2389 2018-10-02 19:00:58 Eucalyptus has a long-running name as being the oil of wellness for its reputation of bestowing trust that one’s needs and desires can be met, further implying that their illness and discomfort may be lifted.
2390 2018-10-02 19:00:55 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
2391 2018-10-02 19:00:55 No she has certainly jumped the shark since Trump won

2393 2018-10-02 19:00:51 Does that include banning oil tankers from the Saint Lawrence River?

2396 2018-10-02 19:00:33 No one asking the puppet muppet idiot PM how are they going to get that LNG to market with #Trudeau's moronic tanker ban on the north coast or is that ban just on Alberta and Sask oil?

2399 2018-10-02 19:00:27 Solar is shite? Do you even understand why oil is full of energy? It's solar energy stored in the decomposed bodies of dinosaurs/plants, that we call oil. To absorb the sun's energy directly is way more efficient than burning goo to release it. Combustion is shite.

2403 2018-10-02 18:59:53 If overall credibility hinges on acts and conduct for one, 35 yrs ago, it equally applies to both. If that's the case, actions, lifestyle, life events, conduct in subsequent years should matter just as much to achieve an accurate weight on the scales.
2404 2018-10-02 18:59:37 Yes, I stick to 19° during the day and 17.5° at night. Perhaps a little warmer if it’s heavy snow. Gas has become enormously expensive. It was cheaper to heat with oil!
2405 2018-10-02 18:59:32 But we now have Canadian oil.
2406 2018-10-02 18:59:30 what is worth the risk do you think? oil? or something else?
2407 2018-10-02 18:59:27 Having multani mitti face pack is like putting ice cream in hot oil to fry. Heat and cool feeling, both at the same time.
2408 2018-10-02 18:59:23 Qatar has an estimated 5 yrs left worth of production of oil for export.
The US needs to start radically reducing our use of oil for Lux. Such as Home Heating oil. Completely unneeded waste

2413 2018-10-02 18:59:06 Lo importante no es que hizo con la plata que le dieron, sino cuánto tuvimos que pagar los colombianos para que se dieran. Cuánto vale el contrato con la Stan Oil de Suecia para exploración de hidrocarburos en el poco mar Caribe q nos dejó Nicaragua x negligencia de su canciller.
2414 2018-10-02 18:59:04 Especially if it happens during the very first televised Supreme Court session, and Trump turns to the camera and says, "Are you not entertained?"
2415 2018-10-02 18:59:01 In 1970 inflation was 25%. In 1973 we had the oil crisis and a 4 day week. I would say the country was actually in a right state before we joined the EU. But that’s me. More fact-based than emotional ranting.

2420 2018-10-02 18:58:36 Conservatives are an interesting bunch. They've been blaming Liberals for the mid-2014 collapse in oil prices and the consequent downturn in energy capex, now they're trying to take credit for a project three years after they left office. They're nothing if not flexible. #cdnpoli
2421 2018-10-02 18:58:34 I'll bring you a full setup with oil included if you do it
2422 2018-10-02 18:58:25 Lmao I’m  skeptical about anything that’s vegan even when they fry fries in oil because a lot  of folks use Lard which isn’t even  vegan or vegetarian
2423 2018-10-02 18:58:18  I'm going with the NGO on the ground over an organisation full of industry interests, actually. You can put lipstick on a pig - it's still a pig.

2427 2018-10-02 18:58:06 A little essential oil can help and u will be good
2428 2018-10-02 18:57:55 I’m at the dealership getting my oil changed. It is so hot in here.
2429 2018-10-02 18:57:50 Yeah... I’ve had my fill too.
2430 2018-10-02 18:57:38 Yep, she's no oil painting.  And that's for damned sure!
2431 2018-10-02 18:57:35 I'm literally spending $160 for an oil change and getting some filters replaced nsndsjdjdkdskd I hate cars
2432 2018-10-02 18:57:24 AAM was an amenable, generous partner with KRG on oil issues while oil minister, until it wore thin. I expect KDP will crib and moan about this for a bit but the underlying Fatah deal ( and the $ that will come with it) probably still holds.
2433 2018-10-02 18:57:23 Maybe you'll tell your constituents in #HD33 why you've taken money from Anadarko, the oil & gas company responsible for killing the couple in Firestone?
2434 2018-10-02 18:57:21 Kind of hope it goes down like that, actually.
2435 2018-10-02 18:57:20 You with me... I will repeat SA refines the oil and delivers fuel to Botswana and they pay 70% less than we pay.

2438 2018-10-02 18:56:47 Math and ethics? Say the ones who can't even comprehend that statistics show the majority of scientists believe in man made climate change and that oil companies buy out Republicans more than Democrats.

2447 2018-10-02 18:55:42 Natural gas has uses in cooking, vehicle, marine fuels, pow gen, petrochemicals and fertilizers. It's use reduces firewood consumption, Lowers CO2 & NOx, replaces heavy oil fuels & replaces coal. It's not going to go down anytime soon. Actually, its consumption will only go up.
2448 2018-10-02 18:55:35 will your mum adopt me?
2449 2018-10-02 18:55:30 remember in 6th grade when i unknowingly went to school smelling like fish because i did a fish oil hair mask and asked everybody why it smelt like fish only to go home and realize it was ME
2450 2018-10-02 18:55:22 The oil companies are dumping money into this shitty account.

2452 2018-10-02 18:55:15 Has he seen oil prices? Also, I actually hire people: inflation is way over 2%.

Bernie is making REAL GOOD money as another snake oil salesman.
2462 2018-10-02 18:54:16 The words "you have to watch The Cheviot, The Stag and The Black Black Oil, it's on YouTube" were said quite a lot. We spent two days riding across the estate of the Duke of Westminster. No wonder Cameron was so opposed to a Yes vote in 2014. We need to fix the inheritance laws.
2463 2018-10-02 18:54:14 Ricin, the poison, is a lectin??? like castor oil? can you please address this again, @rsbellmedia? you know, the sprout, bean, grain, nightshade issue? Will be listening to the Robert Scott Bell Show on GCN at 7:00pm! @ItsSuperDon
2464 2018-10-02 18:54:06 Jiffy Lube really quoted me $79.99 for a semi-synthetic oil change. I felt so tried.

2469 2018-10-02 18:53:38 Surprised four of the #Charlottesville suspects are from Ca, but less so when I recall #Torrance has a history of sunset laws & racism. The entire “South Bay” was a no-go zone for Blacks until recent massive retail development displaced oil fields. Aerospace is a racism holdout.

2477 2018-10-02 18:53:06 Wonder where does the vegetable oil come from? Do we have enough rape fields to produce what we use?  Serious question....
2478 2018-10-02 18:53:01 16 out of the 54 African countries export crude oil.
2479 2018-10-02 18:53:01 A cup of fruit\veggies purchased fresh and prepared by yourself is at best a $1 outlay but require the use of a knife. Potatoes have little food value but offer tremendous profits if you coat them with sugars and spice, fry them in oil and sell them to someone else.
2480 2018-10-02 18:52:54 we have wind, sun, rain and the sea, those are all sources of renewable energy that are much cheaper than oil and can address our pollution problems!
2481 2018-10-02 18:52:38 Just think of the possibilities if instead of 'ricin' it was called 'Castor Oil Cracklin's.'
2482 2018-10-02 18:52:33 Need someone to oil my scalp, let’s see if my mom wants to.
2483 2018-10-02 18:52:23 We are working on legislative framework on oil & gas which we will take to cabinet soon. That sector has a lot of potential. South Africa deserves a fully developed petroleum sector #KarimaBrownShow #MiningCharter
2484 2018-10-02 18:52:21 No, because the US wouldn't sanction itself.  The venezuelans are suffering directly at the hands of the US, not Maduro. They still have a capitalist economy btw, they nationalized their oil resources and the US punishes them for not handing them over to the US

2498 2018-10-02 18:51:01 It was misslabeled. The only randomization that took place was coin flip on which of two hospitals would start with soy oil. Participants came to the hospitals (K or N) from their designated geographical districts as they would come whether study existed or not.

2500 2018-10-02 18:50:47 boy in my enviro politics class says “i don’t know the science of it but i’m pretty sure the earth will never run out of oil” lmao BET
2501 2018-10-02 18:50:42 yup exactly. They ran out of oil, not out of reichsmarks. Nobody argues that printing reichsmarks creates oil. But you *can* get to full employment. Which they did, and conquered France in malaise with mass unemployment, which they couldn't solve - not enough francs!
2502 2018-10-02 18:50:34 Спасибо огромное~
Ну знаешь, я имела ввиду, что типа, ты должен учить то, что тебе по настоящему интересно 
2503 2018-10-02 18:50:23 Can’t believe the @SEC_Enforcement aren’t getting on this! Oh wait they might be funded by the oil industry 
2504 2018-10-02 18:50:18 Yeah about 1/8 in. (3mm) oil in pan.  You might need to add oil as you continue frying as the cornflour does absorb it.  When done place tofu on paper kitchen towel to absorb some of the excess oil
2505 2018-10-02 18:50:17 Data is the new oil.
2506 2018-10-02 18:50:13 Oil Prices steadied near their highest since November 2014 as markets braced for tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran kick in next month.

2516 2018-10-02 18:49:07 but i dont have any olive oil
2517 2018-10-02 18:49:01 Now that oil went up to $ 83 a barrel, it is almost at the highest level it reached 4 years ago. For Lebanon this is extremely bad and means EDL's $ 2 bl deficit and our public debts will go further up, the treasury and consumers will  bear higher energy and transport costs

2528 2018-10-02 18:47:51 @DrOz  I'm watching your CBD episode right now and in MA medicinal marijuana dispensaries sell products and list the CBD levels as well as people who take legally sold CBD oil in MA where it's strictly regulated, the research is readily available. People... It's out there.
2529 2018-10-02 18:47:43 @KellyannePolls That tax cut we got. The price of oil per barrel just ate that up!
2530 2018-10-02 18:47:43 UPDATE: We have had the potential palm oil deposits on Brancaster Beach looked at and they are peat deposits that have broken away and are nothing to worry about. Thank you for retweeting the earlier message.
2531 2018-10-02 18:47:39 Both Houston and Dallas are headquarters to the State's oil industry AND major medical centers with multiple routes. Their transit agencies DID NOT go on the warpath against people and communities needing access to resources!!
2532 2018-10-02 18:47:38  Maybe, but there is a science to it. Adjustments are made underway depending on lab analysis and scans. We initially had great success, but the unrelated illness caused some complications and a slight setback. Also using full spectrum CBD oil with some THC present.
2533 2018-10-02 18:47:25 More to Medicare, Social Security, Federal and State taxes.  That said I'm happy for them. 
Let's just tell the whole story, right Bernie?

2540 2018-10-02 18:46:23 Ohio gonna illegalize CBD oil but can’t get fentanyl laced heroin off the streets seems like they have bigger fish to fry
2541 2018-10-02 18:46:21 Even with their suffering under sanctions, they're far better off keeping their oil nationalized.
2542 2018-10-02 18:46:13 Of course oil!
2543 2018-10-02 18:46:11 Commentary is so bias towards the oil boys it's cringe worthy

2545 2018-10-02 18:46:08 Just point me where u saw me defending him & we can have an honest discussion. If u perceive by pointing out that the rising price of crude oil & our current  price formula leaves no room for any1 to tackle the  price hikes then I  . Perhaps u just don’t like facts
2546 2018-10-02 18:46:08 Been doing some research trying to find the right beard balm/oil and I got this idea that why not get my own natural ingredients and experiment.   stay tuned lol

2556 2018-10-02 18:45:28 #productionengineer  needed for a local contract in Nigeria. This is a senior position and an incredible step up ahead of a surge in oil price. The role is with a great African Operator, who has been proactive through this tough period and has ongoing growth. @WallisInternat1
2557 2018-10-02 18:45:14 Honestly you might wanna stick to what you use. Or actually use cetaphil. It’s a very gentle face wash. But get you some essential oils. Vitamin e oil especially. Then find another one that your skin likes. I started using oils and it’s amazing

No Kashmir, Border problems etc
2564 2018-10-02 18:44:27 Proof please, the European Union works by being present just not to show your face, 

England could have opted for the Oil Welfare Fund, it could have opted for  EFTA or other trade agreements, it could have intervened in fisheries, nothing was done, now who's to blame?

2569 2018-10-02 18:44:11 Jag was an unexpected entree & compared to the dieselgaters, it's a pretty cool car. Personally I'm way more excited by the Kona and Nero EV'S that more people can afford. We've GOTTA GET OFF OIL ASAP. Elon started this revolution but Tesla can't do it alone. We're out of time!
2570 2018-10-02 18:44:07 I checked.... They do. There’s a rainbow one you should wear that when you’re rubbing oil on each other 
2571 2018-10-02 18:44:05 Well I remember John Jappy saying there are two sets of books in WM, one called the Pink books, that has all the break downs in it.  We can't get to see that.. all that uncosted oil...etc...where is it going ?
2572 2018-10-02 18:44:05 I put my hair oil in the fridge and my mom put her Tandoori Masala next to it. I now have Tandoori infused oil in my hair. #DiaryOfADesiGirl

2579 2018-10-02 18:43:00 Is crisco the ideal coconut oil substitute in the @BraveTart rolled sugar cookie cutouts or should I use something else? Is there any other nut-free alternative that would be better?
2580 2018-10-02 18:42:58 Some people's brains should be used as Dusa abincin awaki.
2581 2018-10-02 18:42:53 That's exactly the reaction I would expect from my son-going to make Lovage oil soon-currently making enough quince jelly to supply the entire world #bumperharvest

2584 2018-10-02 18:42:44 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2589 2018-10-02 18:42:16 The UCP has an odd hierarchy of Albertans. At the top is business owners and CEOs. They get whatever they want. Then comes Oil & Gas workers, below that farmers, police, healthcare, teachers, then minimum wage earners, and at the bottom is youth. Its the Kenney hierarchy of needs
2590 2018-10-02 18:42:13 Usually a go to for sure, I have but not feeling them. Am roasting a couple of potatoes I found at the back on the cupboard with some salt, oil and garlic, see what happens. x
2591 2018-10-02 18:41:59 2 options. Voting is preferred option. #VoteRed2018 Personally I'm not intimidated one bit by pink hats, idiots wearing masks. Don't take the fact I'm not in the streets making an ass of myself as an indication of any superior advantage. Huge miscalculation.
2592 2018-10-02 18:41:51 Love to see them come after Jeanine Pirro like that!!
2593 2018-10-02 18:41:51 I like the use of word "hubris" as characteristic attitudes of coal, gas and oil. It really adds a punch to the writing. But its use is, at worst ignorant & at best comical. 

Coal had its day because 2 billion poverty stricken people in India and China needed cheap energy.
2594 2018-10-02 18:41:44 What I don't want is, people digging up Mother Earth. With suppressed technology, there is no need for oil, coal, and other elements, that belong to Gaia's body. Destroying Mother Earth is no long exceptable. Mother God gave the Green light, and now things will really change.
2595 2018-10-02 18:41:35 I step aside,

2598 2018-10-02 18:41:16 Okay. No matter what Matsu will tell you, kitties have floof. Not scales.

Speaking of scales, I need to oil 'em again.

2600 2018-10-02 18:41:05 If you don't believe that our lack of progress on the #pipeline front is hurting #Canada, just look at the tape. Brent #crude near a 4-year high and Canadian energy stocks continue to flounder. #oil
2601 2018-10-02 18:40:57 He had discussions as premier that oil money would provide relief...they knew it was a disaster. How much has been invested in oil so that we could pay for Muskrat. Did they invest in oil to pay for Muskrat. Combine the both Muskrat + Relief = $25+ billion
2602 2018-10-02 18:40:53 NO the top does NOT! There are loop holes such as art, oil, fake charity, and you name it!Trump has stated he did not pay taxes wakeup and see the truth behind the Right! Go to the poor area of your state and look at gas prices and groceries now go into the rich areas and compare
2603 2018-10-02 18:40:46 For oil? What year is this
2604 2018-10-02 18:40:43 The ice in the arctic is blown daily for crude oil and the ice which thereof  floats is being directed to the Mediterranean sea in North Africa. So flooding is West Africa is for ever, sorry.

2609 2018-10-02 18:39:52 I did the same. Looks like a great bet. They should go up significantly with oil and gas higher. So many O&G have large amounts of shorts. When buyers win the rally will be epic for many companies. $CHK has one of the highest % of shorts.
2610 2018-10-02 18:39:47 If your skin is dry but sometimes oily, it probably means your skin is OVERLY dry. Which means that you need to fight through the oilyness and get a good moisturizer. Our bodies overproduce oil to try to compensate, which would explain you being oily 
2611 2018-10-02 18:39:41 Baba I hear say the ticket no gree go your hand

2616 2018-10-02 18:39:04 Soon we will hear that the Saudi Arabia cheap crude oil/fuel for Zambia is intact at Indeni Refinery like Social Cash Transfer Scheme Fund which is intact in the Zanaco account...pa zed pali drama!!!
2617 2018-10-02 18:39:01 do you use a lotion or oil? Oil is better

2620 2018-10-02 18:38:45 Sign of an out of control ego and living in denial, thinking that a fantasy movie si sooo important to Russians to downvote, when they are fighting wars, trying to steal oil, moving presidents as pawns and poisoning secret agents. @rianjohnson needs therapy.
2621 2018-10-02 18:38:42 Crude oil Nov18 68 Puts trade 400 times
2622 2018-10-02 18:38:25 Да-а-а. Полностью согласна и поддерживаю. Почему нельзя выбрать одну направленность и изучать ее глубоко, а все остальное поверхностно? Так же было бы намного лучше и продуктивнее. Мы бы больше понимали в той сфере, в которой хотели бы развиваться

#dowhateverittakestomakehimtired 
2625 2018-10-02 18:38:06 Doesn’t mean it’s not sustainable just that potential buyers believe the prices won’t stay elevated. So many have grown out side of cash flow and that’s coming to an end before they’re bankrupt. OPEC and the U.S have both let go of the reigns on oil prices.  Higher oil and gas
2626 2018-10-02 18:38:02 The only bar "fight" I ever saw was a women's oil wrestling match. Maybe that will disqualify me from SCOTUS.

2629 2018-10-02 18:37:56 What if we as a the people of earth valued oil like it should be at much higher worth?  Lets just say $300 is the new average. What do the economocs for renewables say then?
2630 2018-10-02 18:37:51 It’s coconut oil. It’s great for your hair and skin.

2634 2018-10-02 18:37:26 3）In 2013， PRC signed oil contract with Russia for 25 years. 

Russia charges $145 per barrel
VS
USA charges $43/ barrel

The math is 145-43 = $102

Why PRC subsidizing Russia at American people’s expenses?

Why USA always in deficit?
2635 2018-10-02 18:37:24 We don’t get a population share of oil revenues, we get a geographical share.
2636 2018-10-02 18:37:23 Did you offer him any food for oil? I hear those are the only relationships he cherishes.
2637 2018-10-02 18:37:17 Try out Jason's vitamin e oil. It's very light smells good and it's not greasy. It's cheaper than the snail waste you use lol

2639 2018-10-02 18:37:02 You are trying to be right be you not, check second facts about the price of crude oil sitting at $80
2640 2018-10-02 18:36:59 Oh, I see.  Odd, I have made any connection between any news organization with my Christian faith.  It is like trying to mix oil and water.  They are two completely different things.  That is the reason I find the term Fox evangelical to be rather odd.
2641 2018-10-02 18:36:57 A cleansing facial mask, deep black, with coffee grounds, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating ruby dust. It comes as a gel in a clinical-looking flask.
2642 2018-10-02 18:36:55 Hah, typical. Threaten and starve their people and demand submission.  They would be turned into african 3rd world or brazil crimestate if they gave up their oil revenues.
2643 2018-10-02 18:36:47 How can the average voter counter the $182 million oil and gas companies have spent since 2001 to influence the politics of California in their favor? Many politicians take their money. This is our so-called democracy.
2644 2018-10-02 18:36:43 Getting food items from Oil Mill market is cheaper for me though. One can find different variety of items is a plus too.
2645 2018-10-02 18:36:35 Lik we privatised Sasol and nw hve 2 buy the oil it producs at global mrket prices,like we sold all the aeroplanes of SAA and thn had to rent them bck bankrupting the national airline. Like we ran our railway systm into the ground and then bought the wrong locomotives 4 our lines

2647 2018-10-02 18:36:30 Thanks, I'd love to, but it'll have to be later. I have my grandsons visiting today, so I'm only doing quick tweets that I can slip in here and there. I will mention though, that corporations and Big Oil were at the center of what caused WW2 and Vietnam. Not surprising, eh?
2648 2018-10-02 18:36:23 The Saudi Arabia oil was only enough for 6 days. Insulting our intelligence like this
2649 2018-10-02 18:36:16 I'd rather poke myself in the eye walking over hot coals being drizzled with hot oil!
2650 2018-10-02 18:36:13 Wow nicely put! Why do they only protest exporting Canadian oil and nothing else hmmmmm.

2654 2018-10-02 18:35:50 Ah yes, the oil-bomb trains.

But what was it we were supposed to do to fight climate change? Reduce GHG emissions? I.e. burn less oil & other fossil fuels? Then how does building more capacity to burn more oil help? Asking for a friend.

"$100"
When everyone including mon and pop tells you oil is going to $100 a barrel, the chances of reaching $100 become low if not impossible.
2661 2018-10-02 18:35:12 Oh where to start. Foreign policy. Trident. Mass Council house sales. BP sale. Oil taxation. Utility sales. Infrastructure sales. Railway sales. Whitehall projects like the dome. Crossrail. HS2. Iraq. Twice. Libya. Labours use of PFI. The Banks. The Post Office. Want more?
2662 2018-10-02 18:35:03 The only "fight" I ever saw in a bar out of about ten times I have been in one was a women's oil wrestling match
2663 2018-10-02 18:35:00 reasonable tweets can do that, .. Just make sure you don't come back looking crude-like ... can't imagine you looking like a barrel of crude oil
2664 2018-10-02 18:34:47 Actually, what stops us (South Africa) from buying crude oil from countries like Iran, Turkey, UAE, etc?
2665 2018-10-02 18:34:40 Beautiful olive oil from the blessed eternal land of Palestine.
2666 2018-10-02 18:34:34 Oil producers may celebrate higher crude prices today, but 2018 is not the early 1970s. It is a different, more interdependent world now. Any damage to the growth in the emerging economies today will damage the OPEC members plus Russia tomorrow.

2669 2018-10-02 18:34:14 Gas just went down a few cents in New Jersey like I said a little over $0.40 over Obama the rest is taxes by the governor of New Jersey. Maybe you should check why those prices are up and see what's been added. Iranian oil is off the market did you know that?

2672 2018-10-02 18:33:39 Their turn to pledge allegiance to the Putin's plans for Russian LNG to displace Qatar's.  The US is quite capable of betraying its allies for profits and here they are doing it: fighting Russia's MiddleEast gas and oil competition: ~~ Qatar and Iran.
2673 2018-10-02 18:33:36 They might be safer but some of the oil companies still need to work better on their safety. It is why the approvals take so long. I expect in the next 12 months we'll see pipeline approvals.

I enjoyed Adam Driver's oil baron sketch last week, but the rest was pretty meh.

2795 2018-10-02 18:20:27 Wrong my brother... we’re now net exporter of oil after the new discoveries and investments made by the Mahama administration. We export more than we import
2796 2018-10-02 18:20:27 So I got hurt today, but not by a Knife or boiling water or even Fire nor hot oil . It’s quite embarrassing actually, I got hurt by a walk in cooler . Yup that’s right, the side of the door Gave me a nice deep cut , 3 stitches required . I’m all good except it stings really bad.
2797 2018-10-02 18:20:13 Does anyone that follow me on here know much about CBD oil? I used to smoke weed every day so never bothered with the oil but my anxiety is ruining my life slightly so am keen to try it

2814 2018-10-02 18:18:38 In Nigeria, even if oil sells at USD 200, the people will still not feel the positive impact on their lives, but by way of fuel increase the negative impact will be roundly felt
2815 2018-10-02 18:18:37 Dealers really be taking two hours to do an oil change smh
2816 2018-10-02 18:18:28 Ok, before you chase that particular rabbit, please be aware that (I'm fairly certain) I put the 9-11 message on my page on or around 9-11, and only refers to 9-11.

The burning oil wells picture was posted more recently, and was due to the mood I was in whatever day that was.
2817 2018-10-02 18:18:23 60+mpg out of most new oil burners and a lot have 150bhp or more.
2818 2018-10-02 18:18:19 That, the taxes, and, if necessary, we could have the government take control of an industry or two. Maybe oil? But by "basic income" I mean enough to feed and shelter yourself. Just basic survival is not really that expensive. Without a job, you'd still be poor as hell.
2819 2018-10-02 18:18:13 Oddly enough, if a dictator tells someone to do something, they usually do it. Regardless of monetary compensation or lack thereof. What happened to Nazi Germany again? Oh that's right, they ran out of oil, they couldn't afford the war effort, they overextended the war front...
2820 2018-10-02 18:18:12 At 30min no halloumi. At 45min no mussels. At 60min... "we do shellfish and calamari in the same oil". Sorry @Lemon_Butta, you have lost some loyal customers and their friends... #poorservice #leavingabadtaste

2823 2018-10-02 18:17:43 bless your soul!! scents don’t usually bother me, it’s usually just the ones that aren’t oil free that cause breakouts for me
2824 2018-10-02 18:17:01 it's like cooking - do you change the oil after the food tastes bad or regularly? I vote regularly - unless you can afford a new car every year (while the other(s) gather dust in some garage somewhere because the engine seized
2825 2018-10-02 18:17:00 Not the biggest fan of continental food, but serve it with fish'n'chips and smother it in old fryer oil?!! can't! even!

2875 2018-10-02 18:12:31 Exactly. Most capitals at least have one major road with street lights and one fine GRA like that.

Btw express roads are situated at the outskirts, cities don't function on such paths.

2890 2018-10-02 18:10:43 LOL @ "Clears tremendous milestone"! I love mixed-metaphors.

2902 2018-10-02 18:09:46 Sure, then we should not be protecting tar sand industries and invest in clean energy as they create more jobs than oil industry does, both short term and long term. I can name a host of things we can reason for this way.

2930 2018-10-02 18:05:35 Fun fact: consuming black seed oil daily can curve your cravings for carbs, sugar, etc. so it can be helpful when trying to change your eating habits
2931 2018-10-02 18:05:28 Yes,  spiritual  healer  is the best solution for you... 
You lack that brain... 
I think ambode has RCCG ANOINTING OIL, go get it and apply it to ur full plot of land
2932 2018-10-02 18:05:16 key words and phrases to look for; misspoke, misinterpreted by the right, probably carried out by some alt-right fringe group to make the left look bad.
2933 2018-10-02 18:05:00 Chemo is a terrible thing to do to the body... It not only kills the cancer, it kills you too. :(

If you live in a state where it's legal, try finding cannabis oil. Research it if you don't know anything about it. Nature is the answer, not drugs -- whatever form they may have.
2934 2018-10-02 18:04:51 Yes, I corrected myself. What I meant was Vitamin E oil.

2940 2018-10-02 18:03:54 LOL The Stale oil shat!
2941 2018-10-02 18:03:48 Sorry @PFEW_Chair I really don't think that he does get it. Still just the words of another snake oil salesman in my book. Had plenty of time to get settled and start making a difference but we've seen nothing yet. I won't hold my breath.
2942 2018-10-02 18:03:30 I wanna share too.. 
1. I usually oil cleanse my face with Grapeseed oil. If I'm lazy, I use an oil based cleanser. I use a neem oil face cleanser, which cleared most of my acne. 
2. I use witch hazel to tone my face, especially at night. I usually add a few drops of lavender oil
2943 2018-10-02 18:03:27 Tensions are heating up over crude oil yet again. I for one am tired of wars over a damn outdated limited resource that we don't need. The world hasn't needed crude oil for at least two decades!
2944 2018-10-02 18:03:27 Sweet!  Looks like an oil wrestler!
2945 2018-10-02 18:03:27 Манга — вот выход. На неё нужно намного меньше времени.
2946 2018-10-02 18:03:13 I did 3 assignments today and got a oil change and I’m about to workout....it feels good to be productive for once 
2947 2018-10-02 18:02:58 @RachelNotley I was curious if the fact that BC has given the green light to an American pipeline carrying jet fuel through their province, yet not one from their Canadian neighbors , is a sign of something deeper than just not wanting our oil? How is this fair for Canada?
2948 2018-10-02 18:02:57 If this was a serious effort, we'd take every single $ we spend on subsidies for ANYTHING in energy and pour it into R&D so that renewable is as cheap as oil & gas. Until then we are just jerking off
2949 2018-10-02 18:02:50 Home heating oil is $3! Most tanks hold 275 gallons! How is someone making that wage suppose to heat their home this winter and still live with dignity & security?
2950 2018-10-02 18:02:44 Ask if he knew what palm oil was and how it’s destroying rainforests. And ask if he’s aware of nestle’s human rights abuses.
2951 2018-10-02 18:02:04 Potential : We import 0.4m barrels of oil per day, spending R80bn. If we controlled Angola like the Chinese do, we'd reduce that to 0.2m barrels, save & R40bn. R40bn every year. Forever.
2952 2018-10-02 18:01:59 And of course, bear in mind Iran was fighting a war during most of that decade, virtually alone, while half Pahlavi was riding huge oil revenues. But agree that difficult to compare.
2953 2018-10-02 18:01:51 It's oil based. sits on top of the water! that's how it works.
2954 2018-10-02 18:01:48 IN OCTOBER 1973 US OIL PRICES SKYROCKETED AND GASOLINE AND SHORTAGES INFLATION BEGAN TO SOAR. I THINK THE FEDS KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  GOOD PLUBLIC  I HAVE A SMALL CAR A RIO KIA GOOD ON MILEAGE I CALL IT A RIO CADILLAC . BUY HOMES  AND MOTOR VEHICLES WHEN YOU CAN.
2955 2018-10-02 18:01:41 "Giroir(DEA) noted that CBD doesn’t meet the descrip of even the  least-restrictive class of controlled subs, Sched 5, but that international drug treaties require...."  So in smoking flower you get CBD, in using oil you get CBD but Cali makes CBD alone verboten?  Makes sense!
2956 2018-10-02 18:01:37 Maybe you disrespected the oil the troops died for?
2957 2018-10-02 18:01:28 Too much oil .! 
2958 2018-10-02 18:01:27 Oil
2959 2018-10-02 18:01:27 S/o to the nice lady @ American Shaman for the free sample. Took my little glass of apple juice and a dose of Blueberry CBD oil before checking into my ortho appointment
2960 2018-10-02 18:01:21 The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2961 2018-10-02 18:01:13 @MegsterA7x I saw You spent your oil money and made a movie that's been around for a while in movie theaters. How close does it resembles your life and how did You manage to get Jason Statham to star in it?
2962 2018-10-02 18:01:08 My husband loves back massages with cbd oil for his sciatica pain 
2963 2018-10-02 18:00:56 That is bad... bad all over the place.
2964 2018-10-02 18:00:56 Probably a good idea for India given they want to keep buying Iranian oil!
2965 2018-10-02 18:00:54 Who is heading oil ministry when DP is busy in so many political and social events...
2966 2018-10-02 18:00:51 Key term: If you know the route. Through the sewer, pick an expert locked door, sneak into the cellar, burn the guy who's standing on the oil, pick the safe, and get out through the nearby sewer hole. If it's your first time, all you'll know is "sewer goes somewhere". Also if>
2967 2018-10-02 18:00:47 Housing has stopped being a profitable asset class, auto sales are falling double digits, oil is rising, as it is a tax, and yet Powell says this is an extraordinary economy, and will keep raising rates.  I have seen this movie before.

2970 2018-10-02 18:00:40 The rotary engine was an amazing feat of engineering. But it was unsuited as a vehicle engine. Low torque and oil leaking/burning. I had a cool RX7 convertible back in the day but the rotary spoiled it.

2980 2018-10-02 17:59:52 Am nt seeing @899SpiceFM tagged wen they are also sponors anti oil city aka hoima place to be 20th pct
2981 2018-10-02 17:59:42 (An MPC mentioned this in a debate with John)This is a questionable policy to say the least ,but the point is ,it is that easing of policy that causes the inflation and not the oil price rise that CBs conveniently blame when inflation arrives after a lag and it goes #titsup
2982 2018-10-02 17:59:29 Assuming that the oil/gas boom is driving a bunch of that, will be very interesting as grid electrification starts to impact oil and gas demand..
2983 2018-10-02 17:59:28 The jon cox for governor as are hilarious, They depict a minority woman blaming him for high gas and food prices. Can anyone say tarrifs and big oil manipulation?

2991 2018-10-02 17:58:59 is there an essential oil that fights road rage? i need it asap
2992 2018-10-02 17:58:58 Instead of political donations from wealthy slave owners, they grew the state and tax-payer institutions and unions to fund them. Teachers unions, labor unions, Planned Parenthood, Multi-national corporations like Big Oil and Big Tech.
2993 2018-10-02 17:58:48 We just got some new *Black funnel top honeycomb oil rig*
2994 2018-10-02 17:58:48 Appeasement is a very dangerous road. The participation trophy that will be handed out if good does not triumph over evil is one I do not want. Winning in this case IS everything.

2996 2018-10-02 17:58:47 The world's 3rd biggest oil refinery will be at Gwadar after Imran Khan brought in Saudi Arabia as another partner in.
 #CPEC 
All previous govt were interested to make money out of CPEC rather thinking about this nation instead.
2997 2018-10-02 17:58:44 No. "Muslim Terrorists" have become the staple 4 TV, film & radio. You are quite happy knowing the US military is the worlds largest consumer of oil.

Wall to wall propaganda against Muslims since 9/11 in support of war. Killing over 2 Million, creating over 70 Million Refugees.
2998 2018-10-02 17:58:37 l said it the other day, l'll say it again. lt's time to clean, oil and check inventory.
2999 2018-10-02 17:58:32 So democrats have little packets of ricin handy - or do they condense the castor beans first or buy the stuff distributed as 'hair oil" ? How does this work exactly? Let's just pop some ricin  in the post and see what happens?
3000 2018-10-02 17:58:27 It is about a better future and solutions for the problems on our planet. But I understand that money is the only thing for you.  Go long with sugar water and the big oil and short companies with solutions. But be clear about the fact that you are purblind & destroy this planet.

3011 2018-10-02 17:56:38 Yea just make sure to use organic pure and unrefined coconut oil. It’s all natural and will deposit moisture back into your hair and it’s also anti-fungal so it’s good for your scalp if it gets dry
3012 2018-10-02 17:56:35 私あぶらさんの脳見たかもしれない
3013 2018-10-02 17:56:33 Had we got a succession plan for nuclear power in the 80's we'd have a much more secure and sustainable energy mix than we have at present and be less dependant on foreign dirty oil and gas markets.
3014 2018-10-02 17:56:33 Yal coconut oil is the bomb! I’ve been using it on my hair before I wash it(twice a week) as a lip balm and moisturizer. IM SO SOFT
3015 2018-10-02 17:56:28 Why do people prefer lipgloss over lipstick it feels like I have oil on my lips and I can’t eat
3016 2018-10-02 17:56:26 Its not due to the steaks lmao, learn nutrition first please, cause of hearth attacks are caused by bad fats like vegetable oil and lots of sugar that makes the body problems with digestion also steak can be bad when you eat a lot also try to eat organic meats, also add veggies.
3017 2018-10-02 17:56:24 No matter how you shake your container of water and oil, they will not be mixed together. There will be a clear separation of two different liquids contained in a single container.
3018 2018-10-02 17:56:23 Number 1 Acoustics. No news there.

3019 2018-10-02 17:56:14 @bertkreischer ok Bert. You need to be on cbd feco oil. Your high blood pressure will regulate beautifully. You will also be able to wean off those bp pharma. Your Dr should be arrested.
3020 2018-10-02 17:56:13 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
3021 2018-10-02 17:55:57 Oh wow!  Well done. It certainly isn't an easy journey but just think it's worth it. For your edges try using Jamaican black castor oil on it every day and see if it helps
3022 2018-10-02 17:55:54 What about footprint for traditional car companies, oh and I worked in oil industry for 30 yrs so don’t lie.
3023 2018-10-02 17:55:52 Binary thinking is super annoying. I see it lots, this "it's all totally one way or the other" mindset.

-"Either embrace the oil industry or go back to the Middle Ages in every respect."
-"Either [appropriation is] all ok or none of it's ok."

It sucks. There IS a middle ground.
3024 2018-10-02 17:55:50 Americans are encouraging more propaganda+censorship. With a booming economy+record American oil, record jobs for minorities+women, better trade + Dem's blatant weaponization of gov, Antifa mob rule + push for open borders, Trump should be at 90% approval.
3025 2018-10-02 17:55:41 Too much oil? Texas boom outpaces supply, transport networks...

3029 2018-10-02 17:55:03 I don't think Nigeria should be classified as low income country. Nigeria has the 10th largest crude oil reserve in the world. Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of crude oil in the world. Our politicians are one of the highest paid politicians in the world. @Nass Thanks you.
3030 2018-10-02 17:54:53 I’m quite aware of the controversy & stigma surrounding cbd oil. As more progressives take a stand others will gradually succumb. There’s no denying its benefits, but drs have to worry about litigation issues also. What if someone’s allergic? There’s a whole new can of worms!
3031 2018-10-02 17:54:53 Change your own oil and save yourself some money
3032 2018-10-02 17:54:49 Wait until LNG tankers start traveling the shipping lanes. An explosion could unleash a fury nuclear in proportion. Never mind an oil spill, more humans, if near a city will disappear than sea life after a spill.
3033 2018-10-02 17:54:46 We just got some new *Green bird cage oil rig 14mm*
3034 2018-10-02 17:54:44 @VinnieTortorich I bought the little bottles off your influencer page both sizes. I have VC Olive Oil and the PVC Ultra Salt.  What is your recipe again for your drink?  Going to practice a run with it.  Thanks!

3036 2018-10-02 17:54:21 Do you understand that Trump's tax cuts for Billionaires is just like Socialism?
How about the Billions of dollars the government gives to the oil companies? Socialism!
And speaking of AMZ,  many states offered Bezos ZERO in state taxes to move to their state!!!
Corp. Socialism!

3039 2018-10-02 17:54:17 What an absolutely ridiculous statement from Dickov. They are and will never be as big as United and I’m an Arsenal who also are much bigger and let’s not forget Liverpool. They’ve only got a history of the last 6 years and without the oil money they’d be yoyoing still
3040 2018-10-02 17:54:15 The market through elasticities of demand will decide what money is directed where ,but only when more money is introduced into the economy (cetirus paribus) will it lead to inflation. 
CBs when faced with a supply-shock (oil price rise FI)may loosen policy to soften the blow >
3041 2018-10-02 17:54:13 Oil change then car wash.
3042 2018-10-02 17:54:12 That is it. Which ever way the oil goes is of less benefit to Nigeria.  Higher oil price means that we have to pay more, maybe all the revenue accrued from the price rise to get undisrupted fuel flow in the country
3043 2018-10-02 17:54:10 Who is heading the oil ministry when DP is doing so many other social and political activity.
3044 2018-10-02 17:53:59 You didnt prove me wrong. Just an unsupported generalization.  Few of these acts are spontaneous. They start with rhetoric and progress to being ingrained into an ideology. 
History is replete
3045 2018-10-02 17:53:49 For about 3 months now, Nigeria's external reserves have been on steady fall. 

But it appears succour is imminent for our innocent reserves to rise again as oil prices rally above $85 per barrel.
3046 2018-10-02 17:53:12 Alaska what do you with your nature? Azerbeidzjan have more oil than you. And that country can their bath full filled with oil! Mrs Palin you are bad!
3047 2018-10-02 17:53:10 How about kill McDonald’s and bring a real trade and training to our communities? $15 phr isn’t a fix, it’s snake oil and it’s ok to say we deserve better than more burger flipping money in Detroit.
3048 2018-10-02 17:52:59 Ford Fiesta Love and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

3053 2018-10-02 17:52:30 The US is trying regime change in Venezuela because we want their oil and for no other reason. We don’t even focus on lifting Americans out of poverty. And fuck this country and fuck the rich. Some can’t even afford basic necessities in the US while the wealthy amass more capital
3054 2018-10-02 17:52:27 But wait!!!  We have no pipelines to send said oil across the border!!

3056 2018-10-02 17:52:26 There was no rule how much oil you could burn mate,that is why they added it ,first from Monza last year till end of season (0.9 l/100 km) and then this year (0.6 l/100 km).
But let leave it here cause it is not worth losing time on it.
3057 2018-10-02 17:52:11 The only idiot one here is you . Look at the oil price it has raised to 87$ and do you know what does rise in oil means or u skipped you’re economics class ?

LNG is vital to getting Asia off coal to lower their huge GHG, NOX, SOX and Sooty particles. BC's GHGs R nothing.

The Guardian famously played along & then Iraq war, bombing terrorising countries with oil.

Time and again its been proved hes no idea of the real no deal facts
3101 2018-10-02 17:47:43 I agree with your last point regarding the possibility that calorie surplus explains the result. I mentioned it here because I consider it an overfeeding study.  But should the take away be corn oil causes CVD as so many do with sat fat overfeeding studies, incl Dr Davis above?

3124 2018-10-02 17:45:35 I get the fear! It's just so sad to not be able to eat olive oil, and to believe things that aren't true.
3125 2018-10-02 17:45:34 The first warning the FIA ever sent about the deliberate use of oil in the combustion chamber referenced the rule I was talking about.

Freshly squeezed orange & lemon juice for broth, ginger, garlic, Steak spice, carrots, potatos, celery, onion, hot jamican peppers, Oragano oil. Perfect 4 a cold wet day as it is here in Toronto.
3140 2018-10-02 17:44:03 With the oil price just increasing, volatile exchange rate and the fact that over 50% of the fuel price is taxes, I might be better of importing a #Tesla
3141 2018-10-02 17:43:53 DO NOT use chemo, it will feed the cancer cells. Use CBD oil. Chemo will kill you faster it WILL NOT kill the cancer cells. If u want more info. on cancer cures feel free to contact me.
3142 2018-10-02 17:43:31 Ruh roh!  I’d be concerned because of the sharp shell. Run!..and get some mineral oil, put 2 T in her food, add water to it and try to get her bowels moving so it’ll pass. Take her for an extra walk, exercise helps move the poops along, too.
3143 2018-10-02 17:43:29 Aku abis maskeran pake greentea sama madu.. tp gatau karena itu apa bukan udah pernah di pake face oil gitu ga?
3144 2018-10-02 17:43:27 Correct, but deliberately burning oil was always intended to be illegal. They added the limit to enforce it correctly once it got out of hand.

That made the notices all the more surprising.

3153 2018-10-02 17:42:28 It will run for around 50 years....... thats how long its going to take WM to get back on its feet.  Then the oil will be gone, the SNHS will be privatised.... Hope Nicola is all over this.
3154 2018-10-02 17:42:28 But being a whore is what we do so well. Selling arms to the Saudis so we can tap that oil well. Killing innocence, committing violence, spreading pestilence. Shrug, gotta pay the bills. Daddy's got a new yacht mommy's hot to trot...

Yeah I'm bad at this.

3231 2018-10-02 17:35:44 Absolutely nothing, you’re spot on, oil money is literally what you say, money their owners have earned from selling oil! Fully agree on City, I’d put United, Arsenal and Liverpool ahead of them. I’d probably put Chelsea ahead of them too.

3235 2018-10-02 17:35:19 Ricin (/ˈraɪsɪn/ RY-sin), a lectin (a carbohydrate-binding protein) produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis, is a highly potent toxin. A dose of purified ricin powder the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human.
3236 2018-10-02 17:35:08 Why? Is actual Mexican oil production declining?
3237 2018-10-02 17:35:01 Yes. There's engine oil, brake oil and gear oil
3238 2018-10-02 17:34:59 This is only wk 4, folks.  Weather will be changing & players will get hurt, so let's keep the anointment oil to a minimum.  MNF went Barnum & Bailey on us.  Wentz & Deshaun Watson can tell you a season can turn on a dime.

3246 2018-10-02 17:33:52 Also, the batter is too thick so all the excess is just dripping in the oil. Also because they didn’t take the excess off it won’t have an even fry.
3247 2018-10-02 17:33:38 When I worked in oil sector, our MD asked us fitters if we knew others looking for work as he said that graduates were ten a penny but he couldn’t get fitters for love nor money.

3259 2018-10-02 17:32:34 I actually prefer jojoba oil, I read that it's the best for oily skin type bc it mimics your skin's natural sebum and tricks your skin into producing less oil. Also good for acne prone skin & growing out my brows/lashes.
3260 2018-10-02 17:32:00 That's how life is, you are there wasting food, complaining about the food not have chicken, oil is too much blah blah,  while some people are battling to have something to eat just to get rid of the Hunger as they spend days without food.
3261 2018-10-02 17:31:51 Congrats. It's a balanced and insightful take on the oil industry in Canada.
3262 2018-10-02 17:31:49 More oil
3263 2018-10-02 17:31:44 It's the oligopoly industry structure with high entry barriers in brand and distribution (though #AkzoNobel lacks the peer group in accessibility of product. You will never struggle to find #AsianPaints). High oil is a near-term dampener but these businesses are cash machines

3269 2018-10-02 17:31:13 Do not depend on solar raw material imports as we depend 2dy on oil imports. India should be exporter of solar panel raw material. Last 70 years we depended on Oil imports. Now next 70 years we should be exporter of solar panel raw materials.

3330 2018-10-02 17:23:31 They've already asked them to investigate perjury, but they will simply present facts and testimony, won't make charges. The MAJORITY in the Senate controls that. Stop getting the facts wrong and accusing me of making things up.
3331 2018-10-02 17:23:27 I read this as French toast and olive oil
3332 2018-10-02 17:23:26 I can’t believe I just found out about Haitian black castor oil 2 weeks ago.

3341 2018-10-02 17:22:33 that first take is so bad, such a superficial reading of politics, the kind of thing that makes women sound like they aren't serious about their political opinions
3342 2018-10-02 17:22:32 What about regulations for construction companies, coal mines, oil/gas companies, healthcare, etc?

3344 2018-10-02 17:22:30 The perpetrators are not and will not slow down and "take a breath." Have the Taliban taken a breath, seen the light? No, and they will not. This is about absolure power and nothing will deter them. Being reasonable with unreasonable people insures defeat.

3354 2018-10-02 17:21:35 But the last time I had a pint of beer in a pub was Thursday night pre-bottleshare. £6 for a pint of Neck Oil!! That price really does take some of the enjoyment out of a beer!
3355 2018-10-02 17:21:35 You didn't opt to fuck the Phantom Train from FF6, though. That train can leak oil all over a bed something fierce.
3356 2018-10-02 17:21:23 A few more dollars and it will be cheaper to export Cdn oil by FedEx..

3359 2018-10-02 17:21:00 Sir ji do you.know ONGC, invested in venezuela which unfortunately has turned out to be a failed state and ONGC had to incure huge losses. I pitty your knowledge here. Just check Relaince was given license in oil field & refinery business in Congress time only. Even Cairns too.

3362 2018-10-02 17:20:51 Mark, From Maine...  Howard Oil even predates Monticello.. He called races at Foxboro in Mass. In the late 70s early 80s.
3363 2018-10-02 17:20:48 If you can explain how oil with diamonds comes out of the Bible, how Jesus turns water to wine, how Abraham could give birth at his age, The red sea depart, then I might believe you.
3364 2018-10-02 17:20:44 they did the same to me at Meineke. all i wanted was an oil change, homeboy gave me like 4 pages wrong with my car. everything totaled in 4 bands of work.
3365 2018-10-02 17:20:20 overpriced marula oil??? 
3366 2018-10-02 17:20:20 lol it doesn’t even taste like garlic, and it’s always drowned in oil
3367 2018-10-02 17:20:18 We don’t have enough crude oil, so we are at the mercy of the Rand and Crude prices. Let’s explore more and build massive storage.

Dear Sir,
It must be made clear to American administration that if they cannot ensure oil at below a threshold -I would put it at $72 for Brent- they mustn't expect entire economies to comply with sanctions that are theirs 1/2

3372 2018-10-02 17:19:56 The political leaders of the Democratic Party are selling snake oil to their followers. When my son desperately needed help, Feinstein & Boxer turned their back & ignored our cries for help. My son's ashes now sit in my home, it's all I have left. I will NEVER forgive or forget!
3373 2018-10-02 17:19:56 Dear @reliancegroup you've brought a drastic change last year in telecom services by introducing @reliancejio  Now the entire nation is bothering about the hike in petrol and diesel rates day to day. Why can't you look after this and bring a change in oil companies?
3374 2018-10-02 17:19:52 Tonight I’ve used every skin care product I could find and meditated in my essential oil bath. I just remembered I have an ep of strictly waiting with a chow mein. I also bought myself a silly expensive pair of boots. Talk to me about self love cos I wrote the book darl

3379 2018-10-02 17:19:01 only thing I see as a good model is the nationalization of the oil industry but without getting rid of the elites ruling the country here it wouldn't help, would be leeched of again

but yeah
3380 2018-10-02 17:18:54 Thank you for olive oil.

3382 2018-10-02 17:18:42 What happened to the story of the countries oil reserves that was sold  off? @Abramjee  and still no accountability or any one answering. With the new petrol hike coming into affect at midnight jut brings it to the fore again.@MaxduPreez
3383 2018-10-02 17:18:40 I’m guessing the current administration will not push this agenda but rather one that opens this area to deep water oil drilling. #VoteBlue2018 for a snowballs chance in Antarctica
3384 2018-10-02 17:18:35 Geez. Rust. I had a Dodge Avenger R/T 2008 for 9 years. No rust. Chewed wheel bearings.  Loved that car.  Asked dealer to throw in a semi-hemi at each oil change - they thought I was nuts!
3385 2018-10-02 17:18:31 The 9th Circuit would love nothing more than to side with Greenpeace/Sierra Club etc. and keep Alaskan oil in the ground. Is this what @lisamurkowski wants for her constituents?
3386 2018-10-02 17:18:29 Stop the bull shit. Why are none of the real reason we need to use money from stealing our oil and clearcuting our forest. How come there is no budget for BLM . parks and national forest. I see we can give money. To the other states Put a line item in the budget and fully fund it
3387 2018-10-02 17:18:14 Oil hot stuff
3388 2018-10-02 17:18:14 @DrOz You're a Godsend. Thank you for exploring with @drsanjaygupta the pros and cons of the CBD Oil boom. It's quite informative. #celebrityspotlight
3389 2018-10-02 17:18:02 That's why you don't put all your energy eggs into solar panels. Jeez. You know, the oil WILL run out.  We WILL have to completely replace fossil fuels at some point. The longer we wait, the more desperate it will become, and the poor are always the hardest hit by desperation.
3390 2018-10-02 17:17:58 I do either turmeric, honey and yogurt or turmeric and coconut oil

3393 2018-10-02 17:17:07 She heard their conversation, but didn't give it importance. 
She took some tomatoes, washed them, cut them and put them into a cooking pan with some oil and little salt. Then she filled a pot with water.  When the water was boiling she put some salt and some pasta in it.

3395 2018-10-02 17:16:51 Could be shorts taking profits? I can’t see gold catching much of a bid while $, real yields and fed funds march higher.

And if you think that yields are about to break out technically (especially the long bond) that is very bearish gold. Perhaps, like oil, specs are correct
3396 2018-10-02 17:16:46 hain main ney apney ghar k khoo main khudai mazeed ker k oil reserves nikal liye hain

3406 2018-10-02 17:15:41 They usually have a topic of the month, the time I was there it was the Root Chakra, and they discuss the topic, meditate on it, and story tell within this circle. They also use crystals, essential oil, and incense to focus the Circle around the topic or provide support.
3407 2018-10-02 17:15:38 Drive-in oil changes are so convenient.
3408 2018-10-02 17:15:34 The Dr is the only one making sense here. In the last 10 years the USA increased production by 90% to 11MM bbls vs 4.2MM in Canada and now we're selling much of our oil at a heavy discount. Oil use is at a historic high and forecast to increase by the IEA. Why not choose CDN oil?
3409 2018-10-02 17:15:30 Sir kindly facts k sth baat karein k kon sa awam ko petrol prices pe releaf dia jb oil 45 dollars per barrel tha or aj 82 dollars per barrel hy. Tb dollar b 105 ka tha or aj 125

3411 2018-10-02 17:15:20 When an industry gets engrained into society too much, there is little incentive for the industry to invest in R&D. Their business is essentially protected. This is why continuous progress is so important - we can’t stop & rely on one single resource like we have with oil.
3412 2018-10-02 17:15:19 Crude oil Dec18 50 Puts trade 500 times
3413 2018-10-02 17:15:11 No it’s a regular conditioner infused with cannabis oil , and it has my curls popping, but it doesn’t have the smell, which is good

3415 2018-10-02 17:15:00 You can see yourself out now. The FBI doesn't announce charges. He was lying to the Senate, so Senate Republicans would have to be the ones to charge him. Fat chance of that.
3416 2018-10-02 17:14:57 My dad is convinced that any oil - even olive oil - will clog his arteries (he's a heart patient). He's a vegan, who cooks with barely any oil and is convinced diet can cure (or prevent) any disease.
3417 2018-10-02 17:14:56 as stupid as it sounds talking to adults scares me. when i had to get my oil changed by myself i literally had a whole ass breakdown before i went bc just thinking about it scares me
3418 2018-10-02 17:14:39 Lol an essential oil substitute.

Salads or dipping I use fresh olive oil

3428 2018-10-02 17:12:53 @Ocado Quite disappointed that two things were broken in my delivery and that the rest of the goods now all smell of garlic infused olive oil.. (nice delivery guy though who tried to salvage an unsalvageable situation)

3445 2018-10-02 17:11:55 Yeah we shit money and shower in oil, they’re the ones who should be all over us
3446 2018-10-02 17:11:52 no......greed drives the price higher......USA has its own oil
3447 2018-10-02 17:11:52 You oil longs better watchout....that deep stop run....is a matter of when at this point. Lots of people long, playing breakouts like fools at the top of this MONTHLY range. That steep steep final rally is textbook "end of move" price action, sucking in fearful retail

3460 2018-10-02 17:11:14 yeh mubashir paye always try to twist actual things and spread chaos. I think Pakistanis side is trying good in negotiating for not to give free of cost land. Though oil refinery is our absolute need and right thinking to built but still land is also very precious resource.
3461 2018-10-02 17:11:12 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

This is INCREDIBLE news. It means that Canada can stop exporting to the US, and keep our resources local. We can ramp down production on exports while keeping local stores

Great news

3543 2018-10-02 17:03:19 Truth, but the main issue with oil is just adjusting your refineries to process more light us shale, then you get a little sticky via price. With Brazil/US soybeans, the harvest cycle is different, so you would adjust purchase contracts and inventory management

3591 2018-10-02 16:57:55 This point doesn't make sense. As we saw after the May round of talks, China can easily increase purchase of US products by shifting its LNG/Oil purchases to the US. It could buy more AG from US instead of Brazil. But the benefit for US producers from these shifts is small
3592 2018-10-02 16:57:37 Add some coconut oil to their diet about a tablespoon a day. And they can have any raw bones or wild game. Just freeze for 2 weeks bf given to them. If you live out of the city they might let you pick up road kill. If its fresh. I would definitely spay and neuter them.
3593 2018-10-02 16:57:34 Went to get my oil changed today and the guy open the door for me. Real man right there

3596 2018-10-02 16:57:27 Cyril and his ANC must cut off the fuel levies until the crude oil price drops and the Rand strengthens again. R17.08/l will lessen consumers' income and will severely affect the poor and middle class working persons.

3609 2018-10-02 16:55:39 $amrn $nept Canadian co Neptune has the lead in the cannabis oil sector. Think vape pens but with weed. They retro fitted the extractor and will have health canada certification any day now.
3610 2018-10-02 16:55:20 And THEN, once the country is stable again, hit big oil HARD, as in a death blow.  This last grab for power by them is too much.  It needs to end.  I don't care if everybody ends up walking.  It needs to end.
3611 2018-10-02 16:55:16 Me too Roger. The EU needs to sell to us. Brexiteers can refuse to buy. The EU has nothing I want. NZ makes wonderful olive oil. It has opened my eyes.#buyBritish What happens when no flights are allowed into UK from Europe? @JunckerEU

3624 2018-10-02 16:54:06 WTI trading room update #OOTT Early morning visitors were from Forex forums attracted by "high price" discussion in news. Longs from late yesterday seem less hopeful today.  Forex guy raves about Camarilla pivots for oil trading but is the only one. Active debate re "gut feels"
3625 2018-10-02 16:54:00 Oh precious.. rub the oil on the skin.
3626 2018-10-02 16:53:39 Erm I honestly don't know but currently trying pure coconut oil and it's been wonderful so far
3627 2018-10-02 16:53:33 You need to put some oil on those pedals, darling; l can hear the squeaking of you going backwards on them from here. Also it’s not 80%. It’s 87% - but since you clearly like the idea of a nice round figure, we’ll call it 90% because it’s so much nearer to that 
3628 2018-10-02 16:53:29 So sorry, I take fish oil It really helps. Feel better.
3629 2018-10-02 16:53:28 Anyways, your the no life out here working in the oil fields gtfo, trying to start something when you weren’t even mentioned in the first place ,

3631 2018-10-02 16:53:28 Or maybe this is similar to Iran I’m the 50s. CIA conspires with Saudi’s to overproduce and drop the oil price destroying Venezuela’s economy. Rich capitalists inside Venezuela partner with CIA and anti-government groups - hoarding goods to create shortages and stoking unrest....
3632 2018-10-02 16:53:18 Well, it's true that they passed a law last year. But almost one year later: there's only one company producing only one product: CBD oil made from CBD isolate that they import sold in only one pharmacy. Maybe it was a step in the right direction, but only a very small one.
3633 2018-10-02 16:53:09 legit every bit of stress i have is bc of my car, car payment, car insurance, transfer of title from my dads name to mine, the loan to cover it, oil change, car wash, like damn this fucking car is taking all the mf money.
3634 2018-10-02 16:53:09 Feel better beanie. I'm not feeling too hot myself after yesterdays oil change.
3635 2018-10-02 16:52:52 you should read NYT article sunday about the invisible recession of 2016. I would argue there was also one in 2011. Markets don't show these anymore if rates are low because of buybacks. sectors may get destroyed(oil 2015) but markets have built in put. its just how it is.
3636 2018-10-02 16:52:31 I been wondering why tf I’m so ashy when I literally drown myself in coconut oil every morning then I look at the jar I sent @Q1Hunnid to get me... this nigga got me moisturizing in cooking oil like a damn chicken
3637 2018-10-02 16:52:21 500ml of coconut oil goes for less than 1k while about 450ml of almond oil goes for 2500 and they'll last you.
So you don't have money and you want to buy cream? 
3638 2018-10-02 16:52:13 Nothing to resolve Softwood, Steel or Aluminum. Which I think is an easy fix. Resolve it...or we shut off the taps to virtually free 1) fresh water 2) electricity that powers over 30% of your nation and 3) oil which is 60% of your daily consumption. Don't need Canada eh? Ha ha
3639 2018-10-02 16:52:12 Also, get a flamethrower that uses citrus oil #hottip
3640 2018-10-02 16:52:08 I need an oil change but I keep putting it off.... for whyyy??

3647 2018-10-02 16:51:43 There was no oil from saudi. That $20m was probably stolen. If $20m worth of fuel lasts only 6 days, how much worth of fuel is spent per month???
3648 2018-10-02 16:51:38 Was it good? Any oil or dry before baking?
3649 2018-10-02 16:51:26 I seem to remember this was not unusual in the 70s. I was a small kid with asthma then and I'm sure it was commonplace. I think it was the delicious one. like Malt and Cod Liver Oil.

3709 2018-10-02 16:44:10 It flowed at 3000 barrels equivalent per day - including water.

It did not actually flow 3000 barrels (that's not how a well test works) and it certainly wasn't all Oil.

I'm not saying it can't or won't flow 3000+ bopd - just that it didn't.

3726 2018-10-02 16:42:22 But, I'm super stoked about this 15 min oil change that just happened. It has never been that fast!
3727 2018-10-02 16:42:21 True to some degree. OPEC and oil prices are a very complex can of worms, there were a lot of factors including CAFE standards and increased domestic production. Im not saying he was wrong necessarily but it was very unpopular at the time. Sammy Hagar "I cant drive 55"

3729 2018-10-02 16:42:03 adult problem 464 - unable to get oil cap off under car bonnet :(
3730 2018-10-02 16:41:56 Several weeks before, a Japanese student was doing her internship at my office. She wanted to know about palm oil plantation and its effect to the environment.
Luckily on the 1st day, she met my new bos, one who worked and know about palm oil and everything about it
3731 2018-10-02 16:41:52 Why do I have oil dripping from my hair days after applying the oil ? 
What do I not do well ? Need help or I wont have any top left to wear lmao  #Naturalhair #Natural #Nappy #Afrohair
3732 2018-10-02 16:41:30 Will I get my oil changed orrrr will I put it off another day the world may nvr know
3733 2018-10-02 16:41:29 Once they start drilling, the oil companies will bring in their own private security.
3734 2018-10-02 16:41:28 Oil price went from around $40 to around $75 a barrel depending on the origin/blend, since Low-T stole the office
3735 2018-10-02 16:41:19 うえーーーん！！！
3736 2018-10-02 16:41:16 Young 18+ voters had their chance in 2016 but many of them couldn't be bothered to get off their backsides to vote. There may be a sting in the tail to repel your snake oil poison in that a lot more young voters than you'd admit to actually voted Leave and probably would again
3737 2018-10-02 16:41:13 ラーメン食べた過ぎてとりあえずカップ麺買った
3738 2018-10-02 16:41:03 Oya Awon.. Let's kill our self for oil... See what the future holds... Mtcheeeee.
3739 2018-10-02 16:40:57 Agreed, especially transports ... $CL getting too high (cue Trump oil bashing tweet soon) 
3740 2018-10-02 16:40:40 That really takes the cake .We refine oil we deliver it to Botswana and they pay 70% less than we pay. The lunatics are running the asylum
3741 2018-10-02 16:40:26 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
3742 2018-10-02 16:40:22 I can’t hear with my left ear for three days already. 

Tried putting hot oil to remove the wax. 
Tried medicinal drops
Tried taking my ear out and putting it on the blender. 

Today is the day to go to a umbanda cerimony and ask the spirits to heal it.
3743 2018-10-02 16:40:18 he needed the oil for all the torches he sells to angry Transylvanian rubes
3744 2018-10-02 16:40:12 Garnier fructis wet hair and lavender essential oil spray at the 9am but they didnt shower in two weeks and just finished a cut cig
3745 2018-10-02 16:40:11 We're now hearing from crude oil and refined products analyst Andy Lipow on how RINs prices have been impacted by policy decisions and how those prices could move in the near-term future.

3748 2018-10-02 16:40:07 We don’t think people realise that single-use nappies are made from plastic & wood pulp or that it takes a cup of crude oil to make the plastic for just one single-use nappy. Single-use nappies aren’t just a waste issue - they’re a manufacturing issue too #plasticpollution
3749 2018-10-02 16:39:58 So I’m getting my oil & filter changed after work & K told me to have them give me my old filter so he can look at it & make sure they actually change it (a lot of places don’t change it but say they do, esp to girls) which is a good idea but like i don’t want it in my car
3750 2018-10-02 16:39:41 Job update: I actually have one now! Start working for J R Rix on Monday in the maritime bunkering department effectively buying/selling oil, thank you to all of you who have offered help, it’s been much appreciated!!!
3751 2018-10-02 16:39:39 -don’t lick/bite your lips

3752 2018-10-02 16:39:36 Back home pure and proper olive oil was the only oil been used for cooking and frying
3753 2018-10-02 16:39:34 My mum had one removed years ago after giving birth cause it stretched real bad in her stomach and she says it will go away you just gotta give it time and try maybe some bio oil and stuff
3754 2018-10-02 16:39:32 Enough with the thank Trudeau crap. How old are you? This has always been going on so please educate yourself on the topic. Canadian LIGHT #oil also traded $26/b below WTI yesterday...Americans got US$75/b for light oil yesterday and a few miles away Canadians got under US$50.
3755 2018-10-02 16:39:31 It is. Better flavor than most other oils if you don't want to or can't use olive oil.
3756 2018-10-02 16:39:29 APGA screened Ifeanyi Ubah out ?

Maybe, Capital Oil doesn't have WAEC certificate??

3758 2018-10-02 16:39:10 You would be better with oil.....
3759 2018-10-02 16:38:51 @Sheila_Scott @CTVVancouver If the PM was truthful about this notion, he would have had the oil pipelines completed to the east coast.  Better that then paying the Saudi’s for their oil, so they can continue repression of their people & others, plus creating terrorists.
3760 2018-10-02 16:38:46 We can not use all fossil fuels, we need to go to sustainable energy sources now. Much oil need to be left in the ground until needed for other purposes than burning.

3763 2018-10-02 16:38:37 (Had to google ricin )
Ricin, a lectin produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis, is a highly potent toxin. A dose of purified ricin powder the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human. #Wikipedia
3764 2018-10-02 16:38:30 Every weekend shopping mall parking lots in the Niagra Falls area are packed with BUSLOADS of Canadians. They don’t come just for the clothes either. Motor oil is high on the list too.
3765 2018-10-02 16:38:27 Cottonseed oil, high fructose corn syrup, 'natural flavor' (HumanEmbryonicKidney HEK293). What about using real food in your products instead of stuff we were never intended to ingest?
3766 2018-10-02 16:38:26 Crude oil management antha  Private agencies ki appaginchadu..Enka emi ledu andhi..2017-18 20+ lakhs crores crude oil nundi vachhindi..Emi chesadu vadu
3767 2018-10-02 16:38:26 Me : I hate washing my car. Hate taking it for oil changes. Hate putting gas in it. 

Also me: I want a new car.
3768 2018-10-02 16:38:12 I saw from Colombia, Venezuelans were wealthy, they were getting oil revenues. As soon as they tricked people into giving up their freedoms for handouts, they were enslaved. Now they are starving. That was less than 25 years ago.
3769 2018-10-02 16:38:12 I would prefer applying coconut oil to my hair rather than consuming it.
3770 2018-10-02 16:38:09 The guy doing my oil change is unironically giving me a thumbs up after each step I am so uncomfortable
3771 2018-10-02 16:38:04 Did the holiday classic of looking into mirror after a long day of sunbathing and thinking I was quite tanned until I took a shower and realised I am burnt to a crisp. Factor 6 oil was a good idea they said.
3772 2018-10-02 16:37:55 Ted doesn't even *know* there are 254 counties in TX.  He only cares about Dallas and Harris counties - where the oil barons live.  And of course he's also eager to please the NRA.
3773 2018-10-02 16:37:46 CLSA On #crude ( Sept 27)
Very few direct plays to higher crude; like Gail,ONGC, Vedanta

Even under scenario assuming ONGC/OIL absorb all subsidy over Rs208bn budget & using spot crude/INR,ONGC’s stock implies no further downside. Subsidy concerns overdone
3774 2018-10-02 16:37:42 for the longest time my brother was having a hard time falling asleep and would get really stuffy when he went to bed so my mom would always put eucalyptus oil under his nose and on his chest. come to find out my brother is highly allergic to eucalyptus ... ahahahahah
3775 2018-10-02 16:37:35 by effectively killing the oil and gas industry,  you'd be putting alot of hard working canadians out of work especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan.  but Montreal & Vancouver get a free pass to pollute by dumping untreated sewage straight into waters around them. #hypocrisy
3776 2018-10-02 16:37:05 It seems like oil prices are going to hit three figures again in the not too distant future.
3777 2018-10-02 16:36:55 Proverbs 5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
Proverbs 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
3778 2018-10-02 16:36:43 I seriously need to get an oil change this week cause it’s been like 5K miles without one but I keep waking up too late :/
3779 2018-10-02 16:36:42 This what I call condemned oil.
3780 2018-10-02 16:36:40 We aren’t winning. You started Trade War. You are going to put sanctions on Iran which will cost more for gas and oil. Federal deficit increasing rapidly. You have to bail out farmers because of your Trade War. People will lose jobs, consumers will pay more.
3781 2018-10-02 16:36:39 I wonder how many folks selling weed companies for oil/gas over the past few days ?
Only a few worthy companies Imo, the rest will be dead money and you’ll have lost your position in cannabis on the cusp of #history being made 
3782 2018-10-02 16:36:36 I hate when people touch my hair and when they realize they have oil on their hands they wipe it on me  tf did you expect ?
3783 2018-10-02 16:36:30 It's like a super-disturbing mind med between the Liberals, Conservatives and NDP. There is literally no one speaking for the people who live here. They are all so very owned by the oil and gas industry.
3784 2018-10-02 16:36:23 #BorisJohnson may go down well with Con Home but doesn't mean he would be good for the country. He showed his true colours as Foreign Secretary: careless and inept. But he does have a titanic ego, and the media gives him the oxygen he needs to sell his brand of snake oil #CPC18

3788 2018-10-02 16:36:02 One of the main ingredients of Nutella is palm oil. They singlehandedly have been responsible for more tropical forest deforestation than any other brand.  Digest that for a while before you have the next spoonful.

3791 2018-10-02 16:35:37 Great news that PepsiCo responded to @SumOfUs' campaign & put a moratorium on #palmoil from industry laggard Indofood that exploits its workers. But @PepsiCo still needs to fix the loophole in its palm oil policy that lets business partners & suppliers get away with this
3792 2018-10-02 16:35:34 jeezzz,  that is actually my best food, especially the gnut oil that has been used in frying meat.

3794 2018-10-02 16:35:26 @CNBCFastMoney has to know Wapner is a douche. Put Sully on mid day stick his annoying ass on Morning exchange. Josh started a good meaningful conversation about beta to oil price. I wanted to hear everyone's responses. Including farmer Jim.

3798 2018-10-02 16:35:00 The outlook for inflation has since deteriorated, the exchange rate depreciation as well as the rising trend in world oil prices and uncertainties about future electricity tariff increases pose the main upside risks to the outlook - Daniel Mminele

3809 2018-10-02 16:34:13 Every engine burns oil.There was no rule how much though and not being any rule you have no rule to break.
Even now they are all burning oil but not more than 0.6 l per 100 km,as per new rules.
3810 2018-10-02 16:34:07 #syriedebat Syria has stopped paying for oil produced within the country by        Royal          Dutch Shell and Total,        highlighting the economic tensions affecting Bashar al-Assad’s        regime after months          of pro-democracy protests.
3811 2018-10-02 16:34:07 I don't understand 
Like you'll fry the bread in the palm oil or what?
3812 2018-10-02 16:34:02 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
3813 2018-10-02 16:34:01 Never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
3814 2018-10-02 16:33:57 I guess I was obtuse to a point of not making this point. The GoC proposes an oil tanker ban in the North based on arguments that they reject in the South.  Pick a lane.
3815 2018-10-02 16:33:53 My mum said she would give birthday cake without palm oil, but she didn't :(

3817 2018-10-02 16:33:47 What I stated na. Water in radiator, engine oil level, brake oil level, gear oil level
3818 2018-10-02 16:33:41 This can’t be real?
3819 2018-10-02 16:33:24 Yes! Energy Capital of the World needs to lead in all forms on energy, not just oil and gas

3821 2018-10-02 16:33:13 We are raising for a youth group in Aberdeen at the moment. Secondly we are also putting our Oil and Gas asset in as leverage to remove the energy costs for NHS and NHS support work
3822 2018-10-02 16:33:05 I've been burning the midnight oil the past few days and i've barely made a dent in my workpile
3823 2018-10-02 16:33:01 Yah, I think the first fry’s oil temp dropped too much (was in a hurry so dumped too many potatoes at once). Still, it was delicious and a hit, especially with my two year old. :)
3824 2018-10-02 16:32:57 
Just drop the oil bladder idea

3825 2018-10-02 16:32:39 if vodka become oil, champagne ,olive oil in the presence of cj , nab laws dont allow bail, and what we are looking now, we should believe his and all others like him narrative
3826 2018-10-02 16:32:35 No. I cleaned it with the compressor. It is electric. Where should I put the oil?

3838 2018-10-02 16:30:49 Yup. Which is why I grab them immediately pre-extinction event, thus tanking the oil supply AND giving them a nice three-day rampage before dropping dead.

3842 2018-10-02 16:29:36 Oil burning was always against the regulations since the hybrids arrived. The regulations specifically stated you can only burn fuel in the combustion chamber.

3844 2018-10-02 16:29:31 And while they are at it maybe they should start being open and honest about how important the oil and gas industry is to this country instead of attempts to destroy it...
3845 2018-10-02 16:29:27 Even i m also living on road. Yes price of petrol nd diesel are high. But plz check the price of other mundane item. Onion, tomato, milk, oil everything is in control. Check period of congress u wil come know what was inflation. 80rs for onion nd 70rs for tomato.

3858 2018-10-02 16:27:54 We don't have oil reserves. That's the harsh reality so we have to get it elsewhere. The Middle East has most of it and when they're heavily taxed sa market, mahal ang pag-ship ng crudo sa atin. Kaya nga kelangan ng alternative sources of energy, which PNoy shot down.

3861 2018-10-02 16:27:19 A lot different really.There was no limit to oil burning until FIA imposed it so there was no cheating or rule break there.
While Ferrari was surpassing the 160 hp by the ERS which is written black on while on the rules....if true of course.
3862 2018-10-02 16:27:10 Okay thanks.  I was told it was oil on the runway... fingers crossed
3863 2018-10-02 16:27:09 I know the struggle I keep that eucalyptus oil in mines I got l from amazon. It has a cool color changing led mood light too.
3864 2018-10-02 16:27:05 Crude oil Nov18 77.5 Calls trade 100 times
3865 2018-10-02 16:27:02 I need some CBD oil in my life like yesterday.
3866 2018-10-02 16:27:00 I just steam them in the microwave and the toss them in olive oil and a touch of salt.. I LOVE THEM too!
3867 2018-10-02 16:26:57 In Deep Red Bells when Neko sings, "It looks a lot like engine oil and tastes likes being poor and small and popsicles in ... summer". Really, @NekoCase moments could be all over this thread.
3868 2018-10-02 16:26:53 LNG is not an oil product
3869 2018-10-02 16:26:47 Oil prices are at a 4 year high because of your nonsense. #TakeItBack #AlerttheDaycareStaff #DementedDonnie
3870 2018-10-02 16:26:47 Try the I think it's olive oil and cracked black pepper
3871 2018-10-02 16:26:46 I donated my 20-yr-old Saturn to a nonprofit providing re-integration services for women coming out of prison.

Was totally thrilled when my local mechanic threw in the oil change, et al.

(Took a while to find someone who could drive a stick)
3872 2018-10-02 16:26:40 Wrong the oil sold this way Was for Assad Gvt. The oil sold to Turkey to finance Daesh Was stolen
3873 2018-10-02 16:26:37 @AudleyShaw  how can i get castro oil connection. i have some local market and a few overseas. i need to connect with the makers and farmers plz. also the farmers of coconut .i already have the market for the oil for skin and hair plz
3874 2018-10-02 16:26:29 For as a wooden vessel easily cracks unless it is rubbed with oil and becomes useless and worthless, so a person, if not anointed, is easily led astray, and separated from you, and remains unenlightened.
3875 2018-10-02 16:26:26 It’s because of oil we aren’t living in poverty right now and science has advanced to where it is today
3876 2018-10-02 16:26:25 Yes that’s what I thought. Must be broader oil price related. Won’t be down here come Q1 anyway...
3877 2018-10-02 16:26:20 this is an incredible loss for our country ... you are a disgrace and fully paid in the pocket of big oil ... can I ask ?... how did you become a multi millionaire during your term as Premier on a Premier's salary? Just how much GRAFT did you accept? You are a liar and a crook.

3879 2018-10-02 16:26:17 We took the shield off  & oil frequently
3880 2018-10-02 16:26:07 มีเพลงให้ฟังอีกแล้ว เพลย์ลิสของนงก็เหมือนนั่งฟังเพลงด้วยกันเนอะ ได้เหมือนกัน ฮ่า
3881 2018-10-02 16:26:07 And there is proof of groups like the tides foundation paying for opposition to oil and gas
3882 2018-10-02 16:25:56 Thumbs up, now oil
3883 2018-10-02 16:25:41 Yet another masterstroke from the stable genius Donald Trump, thanks to him pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposing sanctions the oil price is rising and could hit $100 a barrel, bye bye cheap gas
3884 2018-10-02 16:25:40 This is about your beliefs of “big oil”

Of course it would be great to have “relatively free energy”

But have you done the math on this?
Where would our energy come from during periods of no sun
How about up north where sun is limited 

How do we fly a plane
3885 2018-10-02 16:25:29 But also so old that you forget the details – oil tankers
3886 2018-10-02 16:25:23 Don't forget oil cleansers. It sounds counterintuitive, but your skin may be producing too much oil because it's actually dry.
3887 2018-10-02 16:25:18 yea I’m using castor oil I definitely see a difference
3888 2018-10-02 16:25:10 Kar ka manta da engine oil alaji 
3889 2018-10-02 16:24:52 Oh yeah? A $20 full synthetic oil change?
3890 2018-10-02 16:24:46 Well trust me, I was in the sun for 10 hrs a day in my youth with baby oil and iodine, and my skin looks nothing like that!! 
3891 2018-10-02 16:24:42 My room is so cold I can open the door and all the coconut oil in the world couldn’t stop the ash party that forms on my skin
3892 2018-10-02 16:24:34 this blue oil paint keeps popping up and idk where from
3893 2018-10-02 16:24:31 UNCONFIRMED: Its been alleged that Kavanaugh was spotted checking his vehicles motor oil, and HE DID NOT WIPE THE DIPSTICK before reinserting. This man belongs in GITMO!
3894 2018-10-02 16:24:27 The very fact that the two dominating factors in play are so different, means that rather than compete or mixing, they are acting like oil and water!
3895 2018-10-02 16:24:20 Petrol pumps are about to face their biggest test, and no, it's not angry customers 

PS: If motor oil prices cross the Rs 100 mark, Dispense Units  at petrol pumps will run out of digits. 

OMEGALOL
3896 2018-10-02 16:24:18 Use bio oil! It's like $8 for the small one. & just put on after the shower! Mine were super dark after I had my baby & now they're just the color of my skin :)
3897 2018-10-02 16:24:18 kalo mau cepet pake cleansing oil / minyak zaitun terus pake clay mask '-')/ . bagusnya sebetulnya emang pake bha / aha sih. makan waktu tapi hasilnya worth it '-')b
3898 2018-10-02 16:24:17 Shouldering an extra $3 trillion in debt and allowing oil and toxic waste into the streams and air to own the libs.
3899 2018-10-02 16:24:17 Every time I get a cold, my mum says "Have you been taking your cod liver oil?" We have known this for years.  The Japanese don't have heart attacks like the West because they eat fish.
3900 2018-10-02 16:24:04 Fuck synthetic oil bruh
3901 2018-10-02 16:24:03 now we're cooking with oil
3902 2018-10-02 16:23:51 I made such a good lunch for myself: avocado + chickpeas + tuna mashed with salt, pepper, a smidge of lemon juice & a little olive oil. 
3903 2018-10-02 16:23:37 If I was not in Rivers state in 2015 nd witnessed the violence I wouldn't tweet about it. Am talking of election violence bro, not supporting the injustice of oil companies or govt concerning the host communities. Get the fact pls
3904 2018-10-02 16:23:29 اتفق معكم اثنينكم

تصنيف تأمين الطاقة يختلف من شركة الى اخرى 

هناك شركة تحصر تأمين الطاقة على ال petrochemical industry فقط 
oil & gas
offshore &/or onshore

و هناك شركة تضيف معها كل من ال
Power &/or Mining &/or process industries and etc.

يعني كل شركة و تصنيفها للطاقة
3905 2018-10-02 16:23:20 they are just jealous they aren't us.
3906 2018-10-02 16:23:18 Someone recommend me a good vitamin c and retinol oil brand
3907 2018-10-02 16:23:09 Body Oil macht die Haut sehr weich...
3908 2018-10-02 16:23:08 We don't need to use oil for fuel, but we can still harvest, for it's other many many uses.
3909 2018-10-02 16:23:08 5555ใช่ครับ
3910 2018-10-02 16:23:07 @LZGranderson You guys are asking Toyota Corolla go as fast as Lamborghini. USC is that Toyota Corolla doesn’t matter how many times to change the oil, change the tires they’re still a Corolla.  Practice won’t matter
3911 2018-10-02 16:22:57 Every time I drop my car off to get the oil changed I try to remember to scoot my chair back, 1. So they don’t bust their knees up trying to get in it, and 2. So they don’t mess with any other seat settings trying to scoot it back
3912 2018-10-02 16:22:57 Sana oil hahaha
3913 2018-10-02 16:22:54 Many people that are comparing Lagos with Osun state or any state  in Nigeria is not getting it . The income accruing to Lagos can run Nigeria without Oil  .Ambode isn't performing. His impact in health, edu, environment, transportation, housing and local roads is just 3/10
3914 2018-10-02 16:22:51 Pipelined do not increase or decrease global warming.
They transport oil & gas to places where they can be burned efficiently so they are climate change neutral.
3915 2018-10-02 16:22:38 Too bad I don't live at that address.
3916 2018-10-02 16:22:37 (こ わ い)今おっきい音で脅かしてきてもう帰りたいです

3920 2018-10-02 16:21:46 Oil going up in the backdrop of the trade wars. ..Iam concerned itna global economic backlash
3921 2018-10-02 16:21:37 Oil change, normal pple an hour max they are out. But me!!! Bruh...
3922 2018-10-02 16:21:35 @HeartlandInst You absolutely recieve funding from oil companies. Show us your (real) donation logs and get an audit or sue me.
3923 2018-10-02 16:21:24 So you'd rather defend a damaging cartel than move to relativly free energy? Because "Don't tell me what to do"? BTW Solar is cheaper than oil now.
3924 2018-10-02 16:21:18 yeah, pretty sure i just added $800 to any future kitchen remodels we do here. right now i just carbonate in soda bottles and it's not too burdensome. that plus some lemon oil and i'm happy.
3925 2018-10-02 16:21:07 Then please send back the foreign aid.  Thanks.
3926 2018-10-02 16:20:59 Like the idiot who used my stolen credit card to order 500 gallons of home heating oil.
3927 2018-10-02 16:20:46 I am far too excited to be getting oil put in tomorrow 
3928 2018-10-02 16:20:40 Nigeria still imports pencils and toothpicks and kill for crude oil that will soon be obsolete. 
They killed education,  we kept quiet. 
They killed the health sector,  we started drinking dogoyaro, 
Now they have killed farmers and destroyed farmlands.  Starvation has set in.
3929 2018-10-02 16:20:37 That's WONDERFUL!!! Hub taught daughter how to change tires, oil, replace windshield wiper blades, & helped rebuild a big block engine b4!!! She knows more abt vehicle maintenance than her hub!!!! 
3930 2018-10-02 16:20:35 Yes definitly, this is also about interinstutional politics between different ministries, ICCN and the presidency. As the oil issue also reveals. But don’t know if it is ‘more important’, the ‘front’ and the ‘back’ politics seem to influence each other a lot in this issue
3931 2018-10-02 16:20:34 -and if you guys didn’t already know, C60 oil speeds up wound healing too.  I’ve also tested that.
3932 2018-10-02 16:20:24 Stop blaming SO he is executing his duties only. Oil cmp. & it's officers has all the rights to facilitate all their dealers differently. Credit is the subject of their own discretion depending upon the repayment scenario. They r not bound to give it to everyone.. Refer to DPSL.
3933 2018-10-02 16:20:09 Anyway, he didn't mention that the dad answered "it is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed. It is the third-largest source of vegetable oil in the world."
3934 2018-10-02 16:20:04 Mumu talk. Nobody asking why Buhari comes on when oil prices are dead? It's going up, they want a spendthrift
3935 2018-10-02 16:20:03 CANOLA OIL, AKALA MO AHHH UHH BAD KA SABI KO PANG SANDWICH EHHH :(((
3936 2018-10-02 16:20:02 When the #Phillies end this nightmare, Klentak will never be a general manager again. Back to fantasy baseball where he belongs. Captain Coconut Oil Kapler will never get another managing job.

That's how they sold hair wonder and left lots of you with your shrink hair 
3941 2018-10-02 16:19:24 Wow, you lefties are so desperate. The funny part is not only are you looking sooooo pathetic but it’s going to be all for nothing. Kavanaugh will be on the SC and y’all are going to get slaughtered in the midterms. It will be glorious!!!!!!

3951 2018-10-02 16:17:59 That’s the problem with Canada,We don’t have a Canada wide energy plan and focus,it’s all mixed and matched with no focus,here we have this 40 billion dollar project planned but we can’t even get a pipeline built for alberta oil, we havefracking in the west but bans in the east??

3955 2018-10-02 16:17:25 Former not related to political background.They wont to his right like Food prices,Land ,oil for growing food .Country economy depends upon for so plzz dont cristicize former. I support former why media not ask questions to govt .Why govt not salve the former problems.
3956 2018-10-02 16:17:08 I find it really helpful! For some reason it works better for my anxiety when I use my vape, but the tincture oil is helpful too
3957 2018-10-02 16:17:05 I'd have thought this is more of a cost issue... EVOO is really expensive to cook with and lends itself to dressings etc. Most cooks would use standard olive oil for cooking I think.
3958 2018-10-02 16:17:00 Most chocolate contains soy lecithin, an emulsifier used to standardize products and correct inconsistencies in the quality of ingredients. It's also a byproduct of soybean oil production. Want to avoid it? Choose #HowGood rated products!
3959 2018-10-02 16:16:52 Harakiri of oil prices.
Keeping mum almost.
Ordinary common people are asking disturbing questions. 
Jawab dhene ko nahi ho raha hai.

3961 2018-10-02 16:16:42 Basically BC is land locking our oil
3962 2018-10-02 16:16:37 Just put C60 oil on the affected area (lightly).  Twice daily and the acne will subside.  Confirmed by studies and personal trial w/ a teenager.
3963 2018-10-02 16:16:36 I really wanted to put cranberry seed oil in the Aries bathbomb bc its ruled by Mars, but it's double the price of all the other oils?? Whyyyy?
3964 2018-10-02 16:16:32 I was feeling some type of way this morning I thought my sinuses were gonna keep me in bed alll morning! Yasss this Oil Has Set Your Girl FREE! I feel so much better now! #sohappy #whoopwhoop
3965 2018-10-02 16:16:27 そっちのがやばいんですかぁ！？！今顔の皮剥ぎ出しましたけどぉ！？！
3966 2018-10-02 16:16:21 I was on this!!! It cleared my skin up for months. And it stops your body producing so much oil, meaning no greasy hair meaning no having to wash hair for a week 
3967 2018-10-02 16:16:19 Exxon is an oil corporation engaged in the study of geology. As every geologist and a great many ordinary people know, Climate Change is a natural occurrence that has always existed since the Earth was formed. So, it is no surprise that Exxon would know about it too.
3968 2018-10-02 16:16:12 Who would win: 

An Oil empire with advanced weapons?

Some goatfucking camel herders in Yemen?
3969 2018-10-02 16:16:09 Witch hazel tea tree oil
3970 2018-10-02 16:15:56 I didn’t eat a tonne of dairy besides cheddar (it is easier on my stomach than other cheeses) but what I DID eat a lot of was fatty fish and greens. I also made these fatty snacks with coconut oil, cocoa powder, nuts, and liquid stevia to fill in gaps between meals.
3971 2018-10-02 16:15:50 This clause could have serious implications for commodity exports to China/elsewhere....oil, gas, LNG, wheat, grains, potash.  As well, US will have a say in Bank of Canada currency exchange rate setting.  Erosion of our Sovereignty? #USMCA
3972 2018-10-02 16:15:35 Then its lower cutter shapes three sides on the bottom. It's an oil-based ink made by mixing oil with a plant-based thickener.
3973 2018-10-02 16:15:18 私もまた漫画の一コマやつやりたいな～っておもったけどやってる場合では
3974 2018-10-02 16:15:14 We all know what happened to the 1 million deadweight oil tanker.
3975 2018-10-02 16:15:11 So LNG tankers up and down the BC coast are ok, as are other transport ships, and US oil tankers, but not double hulled crude carriers with diluted bitumen?  The hypocrisy is breathtaking
3976 2018-10-02 16:15:06 If you want to make millions, help me sell my MANLY clay mask FOR MEN that smells like pine and gear oil.
3977 2018-10-02 16:15:05 If you like a lot of chili oil on your pastel de nata, join our club!
3978 2018-10-02 16:14:59 Kudlow Q&A: Re oil prices, "don't expect any intervention in the oil markets." @oil @federalreserve @economy @anthonymace10
3979 2018-10-02 16:14:39 Yes 
You know weapon business is 2nd largest expensive business after oil. So they(US,EU) want war to continue their interest. One attack in US cost thousands of lives in poor countries. Like after 9/11 US killed almost more than 1 Million in different parts of world.
3980 2018-10-02 16:14:35 So funny when people come into the restaurant and order an American hot pizza and say extra hot please and I’ll have some chilli oil, I can handle spice and then they start crying and sniffing and can’t eat the pizza
3981 2018-10-02 16:14:28 Which one this time? There are plenty of those around 
3982 2018-10-02 16:14:26 You're no oil painting yourself, Vladimir. People in glass houses etc...
3983 2018-10-02 16:14:22 Back when I used to pay attn to the Groupon app on my phone, it was constantly giving me deals of car detailing or oil changes.
3984 2018-10-02 16:14:17 International Solar Alliance...??? How much of SUN is India's??? Geo Solar Politics....after Geo Oil Politics..#TamilNadu Are there any research to Reproduce SUN too ...by Budding or Conjugation..??
3985 2018-10-02 16:14:17 Anybody see a pattern here as we constantly overthrow governments that are rich in oil? Not to mention imposing severe economic sanctions that cause death and suffering of the civilian population. And sanctions don't work we just go ahead and Kill Them All.
3986 2018-10-02 16:14:17 My thoughts exactly.. imagine I read these Tam bloggers using coconut oil in cakes 
3987 2018-10-02 16:14:16 The best use of time travel is dumping bodies in the past. More dead enemies of the company = more oil = more money
3988 2018-10-02 16:14:02 Leche Brazuca, carne Paraguaya, frutas argentinas, Petroleo Maduro.oil obviamente el Mercosur funciona para todos menos para los productores uruguayos , los progresistas. .
3989 2018-10-02 16:13:58 Didn't you know Nigeria is Africa largest economy? but all thanks to crude oil tho cos we hardly export anything aside oil dat is why the govt is trying to invest & urge young folks to go into agriculture to export then earn foreign exchange in order to help strengthen the naira
3990 2018-10-02 16:13:39 I'm sorry but there is nothing cute about frat boys. Like they literally disgust me idk how girls can brag about how their man is in a frat but bitch can he even change your oil? Or fix your tires?  js
3991 2018-10-02 16:13:35 the coconut oil is melt-y again but my nose is stuffy bc fall allergies and the level of mental and physical conflict im experience on Tuesday is setting me up to be a full hermit
3992 2018-10-02 16:13:32 I've heard that from many people. Apparently, the S60 has a similarly large turning circle. I presume that the S80 does, too.

I owned a 1996 V70 2.5 SE 10v from 2009 to 2015. I'd have another, provided it was in decent condition and its rear main oil seal didn't leak.

The one area where red states wipe out blue states. Red states have the oil producing states of Texas, Alaska, Louisiana, and No.Dakota. Red states also have just about all of the nation’s agricultural states.The only blue agricultural powerhouse is California.

4002 2018-10-02 16:12:09 This was a lot of fun and I have to thank @maxfischers for pushing me to do it, I don’t like to shine too much spotlight on myself, the writers at @GhastlyGrinning are truly top notch and the blood and oil of the machine.
4003 2018-10-02 16:12:03 Frustrating!! Try CBD oil (350-550 mg) I take it and am asleep within 10-15 min. And you wake up refreshed not groggy, like some sleep aids can make you feel. Just a suggestion

4007 2018-10-02 16:11:39 My confidence is not unfounded. It’s the people at the top letting me know. October and November are going to be interesting. Remember, they can’t let the inflation hit the commodities. What has happened to the oil price last 2 weeks? Remember, crypto=sponge 4 dollar inflation
4008 2018-10-02 16:11:36 I surely can't be the only person who thinks that the #fuelpricehike aren't simple resulted by Rand's performance and or crude oil.

4013 2018-10-02 16:10:48 I wonder why there can't be (dis)honour award for the most insensitive governors in Nigeria! Arakunrin from the oil rich state in the South West would have been the winner of the most insensitive governor. Till now he hasn't announced to his workers he's been paid Paris Refund
4014 2018-10-02 16:10:43 "In a statement, Kavanaugh wrote, “This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so."

That's from the New Yorker story. Obviously he knew about it before it was published.
4015 2018-10-02 16:10:38 Probably a bot. They’re rewarded with oil or whatever they get (haha) for the number of responses, regardless of content.

4025 2018-10-02 16:09:51 I love how I point to an exact transcript that proves Kavanaugh lied about this, and your response is so flippant. Sorry you were wrong, or whatever.
4026 2018-10-02 16:09:40 Infrastructure CS James Macharia was quoted as telling a press briefing in Beijing that the Chinese Government had advised Kenya to do the feasibility study for SGR project.

Question to ponder; Was there a feasibility study for this snake oil project SGR Before it's Get-Go?
4027 2018-10-02 16:09:39 I didn't start listening till HSR I was driving around eastern Colorado looking for a farm to sign a oil and gas lease and I was trying to turn Howard on channel 100 and ended up on 98 and it was gabe and cam giving baseball picks and I got hooked.

4036 2018-10-02 16:08:55 Oh, we agree on that. It is very dumb. But if he had told the truth, he'd have to admit that he had prior knowledge of the allegations, meaning they didn't come as a surprise to them. That, in effect, strengthens the cred of the allegations. Connect dots. Use logic.
4037 2018-10-02 16:08:42 Crude oil started 2018 below $60/bbl. It's now at $75.

4050 2018-10-02 16:07:30 Notice how he almost notes a specific length of time or period of time, but corrects himself to specifically say "since then, the New Yorker story." He did this because he knew he had been coordinating with potential witnesses before the story was published.
4051 2018-10-02 16:07:27 Weird to say but I really miss coming home from the beach, smelling like banana tanning oil, feeling salt on my skin, finding sand everywhere

4065 2018-10-02 16:06:12 Natural gas is a fossil fuel, though the global warming emissions from its combustion are much lower than those from coal or oil. Natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas power plant
4066 2018-10-02 16:06:07 My grandma use to load us up with Castor oil 
4067 2018-10-02 16:06:05 I think most people understand now that the attack on Syria is about the usual: oil. Assad & Syrian people wanted Israel out of the Golan Heights and further encroachment. ISIS was created to unseat Assad, place their lackey, take all for the Empire. As usual.
4068 2018-10-02 16:06:00 That would be treason, but with all that Trump is doing that Putin hates, like the sanctions, flooding the market with oil, troops in Poland and increasing our missile defense, it would be easier to make a case that the leftist media is giving aid.

4071 2018-10-02 16:05:38 As far as words go, the whole "political spectrum" includes everyone from the religious right to secular humanists, from environmentalists to oil company executives, from colonizers to indigenous peoples, from social justice warriors to white supremacists,
4072 2018-10-02 16:05:26 The oil and gas companies pay taxes. You're not very informed on it. They pay the same corporate taxes as other big companies do. They also pay millions of dollars every year in impact fees (taxes) on top of that. Don't believe it when Wolf claims "they don't pay their fair share
4073 2018-10-02 16:05:24 Price of US dollar plummeted by 30 to 40 percent after Central Bank of Iran intervened to support national currency, the rial & the Gov allowed import of more foreign currency from abroad.
Current oil price hike helped Iran to make up for maybe lower oil exports from November 4.

4110 2018-10-02 16:01:59 Trump may be a climate change denier, but $100 oil acts like a carbon tax, except the *tax* revenues go to producers, in the US and abroad, as opposed to being refunded as part of a revenue neutral program.

4131 2018-10-02 16:00:05 . @AjDomo just told me he uses an argon based oil shampoo. OMEGALUL #TuesdayVibesStrikesAgain
4132 2018-10-02 16:00:00 Carciofi: shaved baby artichoke heart, parmesan over arugula, lemon and olive oil
4133 2018-10-02 15:59:51 Fraudia jhoota.. brend crude oil prices all over the world kum thi tum na apni jaib sa nae ki thi.. Awaam ka phodho na katto jhoot bol kr
4134 2018-10-02 15:59:50 Bio oil katanya mantul
4135 2018-10-02 15:59:36 That’s that good good, throw a little bit of olive oil on them and SHHMACK OF A SNACK
4136 2018-10-02 15:59:32 @NicoDujovne el gas oil $14 y ahora $34. $34.000 1000 litros que en el campo no alcanza para 50 has. Necesitas $7.000 para sostener una vaca por 1 año y medio para vender un ternero de $10.000. No ven que hacen todo como el orto ??? Sabés lo que era un ternero de 7.000 en 2015 ??
4137 2018-10-02 15:59:31 Amen! I never understood this until going through my own spiritual warfare! Now we have exorcised salt, holy water and oil and use it liberally. St Benedict medals buried in the corners of the house & daily prayers to my guardian angel. God gives us so many powerful weapons!
4138 2018-10-02 15:59:30 badle main oil or dharem chahen honge?

4140 2018-10-02 15:59:26 tapi gue siasatin dengan bikin formula sendiri (cahsik). Gue campur sekitar 1 gram spirulina bubuk sama virgin coconut oil sebanyak 1 sendok teh. Trs gue aduk tuh. VCO kan lumayan wangi ya jd bisa nutupin baunya si Spirulina
4141 2018-10-02 15:59:04 I am not against pipelines, but maybe we should focus on solar energy in a bigger way than oil?. There must be a way.
4142 2018-10-02 15:59:04 Oil rice with pepper in an earthenware bowl
4143 2018-10-02 15:58:57 You could be right and ofcourse the oil companies can offset costs now and in the future against tax.
4144 2018-10-02 15:58:57 True-at some point, I believe we will see oil slump, perhaps after a huge a spike in next few yrs, then prices will just stay depressed. Regarding automation, it will be difficult for all of us to adapt. But we must be prepared to shoot or stab a man for a dead rat
4145 2018-10-02 15:58:52 how about going with an oil drum and a helicopter cap and the "False what !! What a fu*** you talk about !! Iam a Syrian , its my ground .. Who are you !! You are a false .. You will get a block now" tweet printed out on the drum
4146 2018-10-02 15:58:46 oil is A biogenic ,  not a  fossil fuel!
4147 2018-10-02 15:58:45 Not true. He lied about leaving the scene.
4148 2018-10-02 15:58:44 It's short term measure for next 2 years. Long term you need to create alternate fuel may be electric vehicles, solar driven cars etc. Or extract oil more domestically. However short term we need to solve problem rather than ignoring it
4149 2018-10-02 15:58:37 Why are we even using the monetary policy to control our economy coz it's just worried about inflation and interest rates...

Let's dump the dollar exchange rate on oil and buy direct from Iran, Angola and our very own Sasol
4150 2018-10-02 15:58:35 Great question, I also find it interesting that Greater China Oil can get an approval for the LNG facility in Kitimat along with a 600 + Kilometer pipeline in a very short period. What is the difference between Kitmat and the Lower mainland to protestors?
4151 2018-10-02 15:58:28 In for an oil change and inspection. Cant wait to hear the 50 things wrong with my car. #SomeoneGetMeAGoFundMe
4152 2018-10-02 15:58:28 Sounds like failed New York style pizza, too much oil and sauce is too thin.
4153 2018-10-02 15:58:26 #umes if you are getting sick I got black seed oil on deck  #liquidgold
4154 2018-10-02 15:58:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
4155 2018-10-02 15:58:17 Yaar oil city se oil de do
4156 2018-10-02 15:58:16 1. Palm oil sauce

4157 2018-10-02 15:58:13 First cleanser: 
Oil based cleanser 
 Hada Labo cleansing oil ( ga ada bahan iritan dan bahan yg bisa mentrigger jerawat) 50-60k
 TBS Chamomile cleansing oil/cleansing balm ( ada beberapa ingredientsnya bikin trigger jerawat tapi banyak yg cocok, 190k)
4158 2018-10-02 15:58:13 Tea tree oil really the goat
4159 2018-10-02 15:57:38 Thanks Dale. I am seriously considering trying this first. Emulators can be dropped in later. I want to see what sort of improvements will be realized with the springs and oil alone.
4160 2018-10-02 15:57:36 I don’t know. I quite like @JRubinBlogger
4161 2018-10-02 15:57:34 okay if I ever need a 15% discount on an oil change.. I'll get at'cha
4162 2018-10-02 15:57:31 I always thought it was Shetland's oil anyway?
4163 2018-10-02 15:57:25 Bueno al menos ya compre coconut oil. Espero que solucione todo 
4164 2018-10-02 15:57:16 The US president has made a lot of mistakes on Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will only endure for a short period of time to maintain relations that were good in Obama's rule. I will reward you with oil but become sane. For me I respect you.
4165 2018-10-02 15:57:15 UNEXPECTED WATER? ffs. There is always water below the oil and its a whole lot more saltire than seawater too if its produced water as against an aquifer
4166 2018-10-02 15:57:13 @DrewFranklinKSR @JacobTamme  What’s a good beard oil recommendation?
4167 2018-10-02 15:57:07 @LBC I suffer from Spondylosis, I am on 2 types of opiates from my Gp, I'm dependent on them, I tsp of honey infused with
#cannabisMedicine oil from a friend, & in 20 minutes my pain melts away, with no oil my body feels like it's 1 huge Chinese burn from the waist down #legalise
4168 2018-10-02 15:57:06 It dries your skin  my skin produced more oil because of that and i had breakouts AGAIN! 
4169 2018-10-02 15:57:03 たそ
「iPadでパコパコしてごめんなさい」
4170 2018-10-02 15:57:02 You are BUNK - Some have been totally "cured" from their cannabis or oil use - You just don't believe them, that's on you. All your posts are very opinionated - You are a negative nellie - Met your "closed eyes" kind before.
4171 2018-10-02 15:56:55 not talking about global oil price but some measures that should put ceiling on prices of petrol and diesel that consumer pays!
Heavy taxes offers some room to do so!
May be inclusion in GST if that helps the matter!
4172 2018-10-02 15:56:54 went in for an oil change... spent $107 on repairs. you got me this time, mechanic man. 
4173 2018-10-02 15:56:34 But it's not. And you're being a douche. The NBC News reporting from yesterday states that he and his team were contacting mutual friends of Ramirez and Kavanaugh in an effort to get them to come forward in his defense and produce a photo of them together in a wedding.
4174 2018-10-02 15:56:26 My car is running 7000 miles over the oil change, I’m not sure how I feel about it 
4175 2018-10-02 15:56:26 Dude.... DUDE!!!

Lavender? LAVENDER!

Oh, wait, I just put lavender oil in the diffuser .

Nevermind (open mouth-insert-foot).

4176 2018-10-02 15:56:15 I gotta get a oil change rn
4177 2018-10-02 15:56:15 No. There are some close seconds but @JRubinBlogger is a sad case of how a human can slip into insanity.
4178 2018-10-02 15:56:07 Rub some olive oil or castor oil on them every night. Avoid rubbing your eyes and waterproof mascara. Make sure you take off any eye makeup with a gentle remover like micellar water 
4179 2018-10-02 15:55:59 Right! Could’ve been a great. State but was ruined by money and greed and oil. 
4180 2018-10-02 15:55:52 Just like Oil mixes with Water....
4181 2018-10-02 15:55:43 Rose oil and... Something else?
4182 2018-10-02 15:55:36 He went there working for a British oil concern which no doubt ended up benefiting the UK.

I'm a British seafarer so regularly work outside the UK and need to transit/stay in EU. Brexit will probably see the end of my career. You're telling me I can't be angry over this?!
4183 2018-10-02 15:55:28 sell up then...cheerio dog to walk.
4184 2018-10-02 15:55:13 There is a fairly simple argument that says that as Scottish oil money was invested in the UK economy, the UK economy is effectively Scotland's sovereign oil fund. Needless to say, that is waaaayyy too sophisticated for Scottish Nationalists.
4185 2018-10-02 15:55:10 I LOVE this oil for skin issues (diluted of course). One of my favorites!
4186 2018-10-02 15:55:09 http://217.218.67.231/Detail/2018/10/01/575781/Araqchi Sputnik US oil prices sanctions

4188 2018-10-02 15:54:49 Leafy greens have been wonderful for me. Spinach with olive oil and garlic powder and salt. Guac is amazing. Lentils, I’m not sure if that counts as a bean you’re not a fan of though. Root veggies, esp if you live in a colder climate!
4189 2018-10-02 15:54:46 ナイトホーントに錆入れたら寒色で揃えていた雰囲気が崩れたのでnuln oilだけの陰影で我慢するか悩みどころ。
4190 2018-10-02 15:54:37 Micellar water gabisa disebut jadi first cleanser cmiiw. 
Aku sama dijut beda, dijut ga cocok oil, aku cocok paripurna. Coba ku list beberapa produk rekomen dan gampang dicari yhaaa dr tahap cleansing~
4191 2018-10-02 15:54:35 Canada and BC produce next to nothing of the world's GHG balance, u know this.  We could stop oil+gas, stop driving, stop breathing ... it will make NO difference to world GHG balance or to climate. None.  NatGas to replace coal is smart and about time
4192 2018-10-02 15:54:18 more expensive other technologies will take its place! 4) the market has been manipulated to ensure that every last penny will flow to the pockets of big oil. (Through the inter-ownership of corporations i.e. Exon owning GM, Ford or Chrysler) rather invest into technologies
4193 2018-10-02 15:54:12 I can make the exact same "art" by pissing in a puddle of motor oil.
4194 2018-10-02 15:54:09 Hey @MindofSnaps what CBD oil do you use? I’d love to buy some.
4195 2018-10-02 15:54:07 Diametrically opposed to 'making the world a better place' are the military–industrial complex, Big Oil––masters of Donny & the #Trumpublicans
#LindeyGraham makes a good Joseph Goebbels to #Trumps Hitler––better than Giuliani, dontcha think?

Ride the Bluenami ≈ 
4196 2018-10-02 15:53:36 Exactly

4198 2018-10-02 15:53:31 Unfortunately for them no one stole our oil. Even after oil revenues our deficits since 1980 are over £160bn.

4200 2018-10-02 15:53:22 Olive oil they say
4201 2018-10-02 15:53:16 what will be the cost of oil from Saudia...Govt must discuss the issue in Parliament . Policies indicate Dangerous Pakistan instead of NEW Pakistan.@ImranKhanPTI @SMQureshiPTI @ArifAlvi @BBhuttoZardari
4202 2018-10-02 15:52:46 I was taught never to go to oil shops without a man, by a man that ran an oil shop.  
4203 2018-10-02 15:52:42 Newfoundland offshore oil trades on the Brent market, I believe. Newfoundland, I also believe, is part of Canada.
4204 2018-10-02 15:52:40 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.28% #DAX -0.42% #CAC -0.71% #Estoxx50 -0.73% #GBPUSD 1.2974 #EURGBP 0.8908 #GILTBUND 110.4 #Gold 1.45% #Oil 0.03%

*tapi muka gini2 aja tuh*
4206 2018-10-02 15:52:34 Yeah I'd only short a sudden move, otherwise I look for another momentum move. I rarely hold oil positions long.
4207 2018-10-02 15:52:26 How does Italian dressing have no flavor. It’s just oil 
4208 2018-10-02 15:52:15 Stay away from products with parabens. Massage your scalp regularly. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or something? How will I determine the true url. Excellent stuff. Easy on the scalp.
4209 2018-10-02 15:52:15 Who blames the speculators depends on whether #oil prices are rising or falling.
4210 2018-10-02 15:52:06 Idc how many times my dad shows me how to check my oil. I am not going under the hood. That's what he's for.
4211 2018-10-02 15:52:05 Im confused. Its a port fed product that needs to be shipped. Whats the difference between LNG  shipping and oil ?
4212 2018-10-02 15:52:00 The nationalists argue that WM stole their oil, yet you don't hear anyone say that the devolved nations and English regions stole Londons money.  It's because (thankfully) we're one country until international football and rugby matches :)
4213 2018-10-02 15:51:53 So what is she saying that is wrong?
4214 2018-10-02 15:51:30 Good Morning! 
When you’re in a Holding-Pattern... And you know it’s the Lord. Receive His Grace Gift as an opportunity for continued preparation. -God is still Squeezing More OIL out of you! 
#TrustTheProcess
4215 2018-10-02 15:51:27 There couldn't be a more timely book than #PipeDreams., which looks at pipelines, railway transport of oil, and possibly the end of fossil fuel dependence
4216 2018-10-02 15:51:12 Screw that. Don’t let the bastards win. 

Whataburger still has “God bless America” stickers in its windows and the best fast food burger in the country. 

Beto will always be a pogue but Whataburger will always be Texan.
4217 2018-10-02 15:51:11 Vinegar drizzle...

A liquid cleanse,
the fluid blends,
of oil and water,
flowing together,
Irresistibly 
as friends,
and foe...
in an eerie
iridescense.
4218 2018-10-02 15:51:08 Oil Change?
4219 2018-10-02 15:50:47 I’m sure you’ve tried different meds. I tried lots of them too. None of them really worked for me. I switched to natural supplements like magnesium and fish oil. Has been a major help.
4220 2018-10-02 15:50:29 All westside nigga know about that faduse Muslim oil 
4221 2018-10-02 15:50:26 Tell me, what will replace oil and gas?
4222 2018-10-02 15:50:18 100,000s of Scottish people work in oil and gas.
4223 2018-10-02 15:50:16 Thinking about it, in 4 years of driving I haven’t checked my water/oil myself once..haven’t even lifted the bonnet
If there’s one thing I couldn’t give less fucks about, it’s cars
4224 2018-10-02 15:50:11 Let me propose to you that 1) that this gas isn't necessary 2) the reason that so many hold that it is, has nothing to do with necessity, but with how much profit cann still be ripped from the Earth. 3) the Theron is that we we will never run out of oil because as it gets
4225 2018-10-02 15:50:11 Well, let's see how crude prices impact consumer thinking. Oil analysts are now pointing to possible $100 Brent Crude (which would be about $90-923 WTI) by the end of the year, suggesting we're heading toward an average $3.50/gallon gas price for regular - if not higher.
4226 2018-10-02 15:50:01 Does the whole Zambian population have stupid written on their foreheads?? So what do these people take us for? Ndalama kupaka and you buy oil for 6 days. For 144 hours.
4227 2018-10-02 15:49:58 When he first heard about The New Yorker story is when he first heard about the allegations. It isn't hard.
4228 2018-10-02 15:49:42 Hummus is probably my favorite way to feel healthy while drinking olive oil
4229 2018-10-02 15:49:40 Cuando baja el gas oil ?
4230 2018-10-02 15:49:35 Where is your anti-war humanitarian voice @SenatorShaheen @SenatorHassan @RepAnnieKuster? This is inhumane & unacceptable. Just because Saudi is a friend with oil benefits, DOES NOT make this genocide that the US is complicit in okay. Killing innocent children is not okay.
4231 2018-10-02 15:49:30 oil to $100
£ to 1.20 

uk inflation more pressure upwards - likes of food retailers suppress margins further - lower profits - less wage growth - vicious cycle down 

hence avoid uk stocks - except $ earners in energy sector 

possibly further bounce back mining stocks
4232 2018-10-02 15:49:14 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
4233 2018-10-02 15:49:05 Fucking time sunflower oil use to you ha

4236 2018-10-02 15:48:53 I've been dripping in coconut oil for 2 years now hoping to avoid this exact fate  
4237 2018-10-02 15:48:40 instead of snorting afrin to decongest my fckin nostril, my sick ass is using a roller ball under my nostril w an essential oil blend of decongestants that *I* made. so i'm sittin in class huffin thyme, eucalyptus, lemon, and lavender.

Drug exactly like CBD oil it is expensive
Under some insurance some not. 10 milligram
Dronabinol Capsules Dist by PAR PHAR. i totally endorse it my neighbor take Gabapent 3xday high dosage he like my capsules better
It has relieved my pain
4241 2018-10-02 15:47:52 if oil prices don't, then rising interest rates certainly will.
4242 2018-10-02 15:47:51 Oh well take the LNG just not the oil....well maybe we could run two pipelines parallel with each other??? One gas the other oil?
4243 2018-10-02 15:47:39 2 bags of rice, groundnut oil, bread and 2 cartoons of indomie....
4244 2018-10-02 15:47:38 Absolutely not. He was asked when he first heard about these ALLEGATIONS by Orin Hatch in the Senate hearing. He said, after some hemming and hawing "after the New Yorker story." He wasn't asked when he'd heard about the New Yorker story.
4245 2018-10-02 15:47:32 @STIHLCanada Hello, I have an older MS 290 with chain oil issues.  Trying to locate the oil adjustment screw on the underside of the saw.  I only see a hole...has the screw adjustment piece fallen out?  Can I find this replacement part?  Thank you for your time

4252 2018-10-02 15:46:44 
4253 2018-10-02 15:46:36 I always visit barns in full makeup, hair done, a black cocktail dress and heels. Oh, and holding hands with a man with a well combed oil slick pretending to be hair.
4254 2018-10-02 15:46:31 Woke up so tired I snoozed my alarm for an hr - therefor couldn’t hike, and was just in an off mood; so doing anything I can to change that. Heart chakra mala, amethyst crystal, peppermint oil, cold brew, green smoothie, and vitamin D. 
4255 2018-10-02 15:46:30 I think anyone who claims to be a conservative while aligning themselves with the fascists on the anti-American left, is both crazy and dangerous.
4256 2018-10-02 15:46:09 That oil does not help us at all if our children die of hunger, if the price that we Venezuelans must pay to the United States to get out of this horrible tragedy is oil, they can take everything, we do not care, we just want the dictatorship to be destroyed
4257 2018-10-02 15:46:04 There’s this weird man pride when you go get the oil changed, car washed, vacuumed and top of the gas.  A weird accomplishment! Lol. Man win!!  Now to give it back to wifey all reset!  #realman #likeaboss
4258 2018-10-02 15:46:03 I really wanna know how they get fish oil bro
4259 2018-10-02 15:45:57 @KendallRaeOnYT CBD oil was just made illegal to buy in Ohio.
4260 2018-10-02 15:45:54 And with the forthcoming Iran sanctions oil prices are expected to climb to new highs once more.

4263 2018-10-02 15:45:41 @bctoday We can build natural gas infrastructure in BC, but not oil? Hypocritical to say the least. Shame on you NDP...
4264 2018-10-02 15:45:38 For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey And her speech is smoother than oil; 

But in the end she is bitter like wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. 

Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). Prov 5:3-5
4265 2018-10-02 15:45:37 Tha OIL
4266 2018-10-02 15:45:23 Yeeeeaaaauh...that ingredient list sounds like a skin nightmare. Definitely gonna dry it out; sensitive skin folks would probably scratch up a rash. 

I make my own bug spray - rosemary oil, clove oil, & mint decoction in witch hazel. And I always spray it on my clothes only!

4269 2018-10-02 15:45:02 In the biggest move yet aimed at blocking the #Trump administration’s plans to allow new #offshoreoil drilling off the #California coast, state lawmakers have approved a bill that would ban construction of any new pipelines to get the oil to shore. #pipelineban #California
4270 2018-10-02 15:44:58 Really? What I hear from people in yoir lifetime is he lied to the American public and created a national oil crisis. They voted him out after one term as fast as possible.
4271 2018-10-02 15:44:56 Also here to hype olive oil. For me it’s a whole package visceral refusal. The texture, the weird way it kinda sinks then the skin pops in your mouth, the OVERPOWERING taste. Why can’t it just be a pickle. The principle.

Luckily I have brought a visual aid,
which will illuminate the ins & outs of the oil industry.

4274 2018-10-02 15:44:48 awkward. must be gold or oil to be had then
4275 2018-10-02 15:44:47 I hope it works! I find that using a Toner and Tea Tree oil helps the most  bonne chance
4276 2018-10-02 15:44:34 Oh yea the Archie Comics. I remember reading one with Oil Man and Time Man in it. Is there any ongoing Mega Man comics?
4277 2018-10-02 15:44:26 Can you pay for my nails & my oil change? Need a mans that can do both 
4278 2018-10-02 15:44:14 Iran has attempted to downplay the impact of looming U.S. sanctions by claiming that it has no intention of reducing oil production. However, such optimistic claims are falling on deaf ears," PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said.
4279 2018-10-02 15:44:09 Oil rallying definitely doesn't help, but think metals are their own market and are extremely oversold. I'm waiting to see the production numbers for US oil producers wane, but it seems we aren't there yet. Still think it goes higher before any issues come to surface.
4280 2018-10-02 15:43:59 I think that I overdid it with the Peppermint oil in my hair today. My scalp feels refreshed but I swear everyone within 10ft of me must have clear sinuses. #NaturalHair #PeppermintOil
4281 2018-10-02 15:43:56 I am giving up handwash and shampoo in plastic bottles - going back to good old bars of soap (palm oil free too) for hand washing in our house - also giving shampoo bars a go! Hopefully my hair won't fall out! :-) #plasticsaction #savetheurangutans

4283 2018-10-02 15:43:29 I have epilepsy and I don’t want to seize if I miss a dose of this. I control it with diet and cbd oil.
4284 2018-10-02 15:43:18 Gross misinformation by the powers that be has probably caused this anger at the alleged fuel adjustments.
Global Oil prices have been on an upward trajectory  and are currently on a 4 year high at over US$85 per barrel. Your thoughts @TrevorSim @gchelwa
4285 2018-10-02 15:43:14 It takes about a week for it to build up. On it for fibromyalgia about 5 yrs doesn’t help near as well and doesn’t make me sleepy anymore. I started on Hemp oil about 3 months ago and cut back on gabapentin.  I find it helps better and cut back on gabapentin

4289 2018-10-02 15:42:51 CPR oil tanker train heading north on Nose Creek this morning made the coolest noise in the snowy conditions. Like a metallic "whooshing" sound.
4290 2018-10-02 15:42:47 I prefer my olive oil to be packed in a metal tin, which is opaque, thus protecting the oil from light degradation.

Second choice is dark glass.

In all cases store in relative cool, away from light.

4296 2018-10-02 15:41:10 Coconut oil in my coffee? No way. I wouldn’t try it even if someone pays me.
4297 2018-10-02 15:41:06 Rubin has lost her mind, but Nichols is strategic. He's far more dangerous. So it depends on what you mean.

4311 2018-10-02 15:39:52 I remove the outer leaves, cut them in half, longways, toss them in olive oil, salt and pepper, then lay them in one layer on parchment paper placed in a sheet pan. Roast in a 400° oven for 30 minutes or until caramelized and crispy on the outside. So good.
4312 2018-10-02 15:39:42 If you don’t want to get hurt by bears stay out of their territory, especially when they have cubs to protect.  How can we senselessly kill a mother bear AND her cubs because she kills someone threatening her babies?  An example of why more oil extraction in Alaska is wrong.

4316 2018-10-02 15:39:13 Do you know that Lagos economy is bigger than Kenya’s ? Do you know that aside the oil revenue, Lagos State makes more revenue than Nigeria ? My point exactly, if you knew how much Lagos generates then you wouldn’t be celebrating peanuts #APCLagosPrimaries
4317 2018-10-02 15:39:02 Just start conversations. I know it’s not that simple but they can’t kill you and eat you too. Eye contact and smiling goes a long way. If you need a push then CBD oil goes a long way in helping anxiety trust me. Don’t overthink things!
4318 2018-10-02 15:39:01 Sir to whome u wana make fool. Crude oil price in international market came to the lowest lever ever that time i.e from 145$ Usd to 27 usd per berral. That time the price in Pak down only to 70 rs per litter which were supposed to be 40 rs per liter. #stop laying ihsan iqbal shab
4319 2018-10-02 15:38:46 Afi coinbeef naa... 
It's bad to do stuffs like this to people o, some people are allergic to some things. I know of someone who can't eat anything flour or stew (yes our everyday stew) , groundnut/vegetable oil and so much more, that joke was too expensive.
4320 2018-10-02 15:38:34 I reckon it's do-able. You can deep fry ice cream without it melting completely.

Batter it, really hot oil for a few seconds.

4325 2018-10-02 15:37:56 When bulking, I’ve had good success just subbing in high fat proteins for meals (using dark meat chicken vs. white; 80% lean ground beef instead of 93%, etc.)

I will also sauté and oil my vegetables instead of steaming for added calories.

Helps add 500-600 more calories a day.

4327 2018-10-02 15:37:28 Could we know how the decision to buy $20m worth of Saudi oil was arrived at? Putting in mind that government knows consumption is $2m a day.
4328 2018-10-02 15:37:26 Olive oil, with a bit of salt and/or pepper if you're into that.
4329 2018-10-02 15:37:19 Hillary Clinton. She’s far worse off for having faced Trump
4330 2018-10-02 15:37:17 The US still has tariffs on our aluminum and steel, they still buy our oil at a discount. They have more access to our dairy and wine.
4331 2018-10-02 15:37:09 risk to the Gold trade now is we just rallied because of china holiday... and we feel china tying Gold, oil and Yuan together. in same story.
4332 2018-10-02 15:37:08 You sir are the poster boy of the repugnut party. You are the swampy professional politician @realDonaldTrump said he was flushing out of DC. You are the used car dealing snake oil salesman that makes up the stereotype of a lying crooked politician!!!

4335 2018-10-02 15:36:42 I want to go back to the old days where living past like 25 qualified you to be a doctor. I'd love to be able to prescribe "snake oil" with a straight face
4336 2018-10-02 15:36:36 The way my GP just laughed at me after I took out my cotton wool because of the heated olive oil I poured into my ears last night to help with my ear pain #greekremedies #villagegirl #donkeyhome

4340 2018-10-02 15:36:24 A reinvigorating facial mask, pastel indigo, with quahog shell, jojoba oil, and exfoliating pumice. It smells pleasantly organic.
4341 2018-10-02 15:36:15  especially pregnant, me and my belly be shining all the way to mars!  baby oil AND the Nivea double moisture with almond oil! THE GOAT.
4342 2018-10-02 15:36:10 "the best thing"?... people died. There is nothing good here. Our children are wearing bullet proof backpacks. More children have died in schools so far this year than soldiers in our pointless war zones for oil. Take your fingers out of your ears and open your eyes.

4346 2018-10-02 15:34:50 The metals can only go higher when US oil production comes down as this will weaken the USD which is needed for global economic growth. The gassing out of the Permian is a strong sign that this scenario will be realised.
4347 2018-10-02 15:34:47 *[[Jas 5:14]] KJV* Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
4348 2018-10-02 15:34:40 @ryanjespersen LNG tankers are completely different from oil tankers. If an LNG tanker were to have a rupture the liquid natural gas would return to it's gaseous state with the loss of cooling & dissipate into the atmosphere.

4352 2018-10-02 15:34:07 If you not drinking Fiji water with your after after fap snacks, you're jacking off wrong. You might as well be jacking off in the woods or by oil lamp and shit. My water gotta taste just like my nut: Nothing.
4353 2018-10-02 15:34:04 how do you like it? I just use shea butter, castor oil & almond oil
4354 2018-10-02 15:33:57 Dhuli moong and rice in equal proportions, triple amount if water, two whistles will ensure soupy khichdi. Do a little chaunk of hing and jeera in desi ghee. Eat it with aloo ka chokha (mashed boiled potato mixed with raw onion, lime juice, salt and a little mustard oil)
4355 2018-10-02 15:33:56 My dad broke up with me as my mechanic because he’s ”too old” to work on the families vehicles and now I have to sit and wait forever to get my oil changed. Pretty upsetting Ted
4356 2018-10-02 15:33:54 @nytimes 
The government of Sweden owes the oil industry.
The profits are deposited in the Central Bank, administered by the Government. If I’m not mistaken, at last count it was 85 BILLION IN SURPLUS!!!
And not trillions of dollars in deficit
4357 2018-10-02 15:33:43 Staff of Nashik very bad Gautam Kiran Sharad .Nutan is in Pune relaxing  .Sharad takes holiday most of the days n Kiran abuses customer n Gautam put oil in fire in fights
4358 2018-10-02 15:33:42 PSA so I’ve had oily skin forever and ever since I started putting Vitamin E oil on my face before bed my skin has cleared up so much and I’m not even oily anymore! You’d think it doesn’t make sense but your skin actually produces oil when it’s dehydrated! What do ya know 
4359 2018-10-02 15:33:41 Crazy access came walking. During my first trip in #bakken oil country a friend wrote: "You have entered a place nobody arrives to by accident. ... you are part of the team." Was invited onto drilling rig by supervisor who told his crew: "This guy asks you questions, answer him."
4360 2018-10-02 15:33:41 I am so effing tired of male beauty products smelling so shit. Just because I’m a guy doesn’t mean I need to use cream/spray/aftershave/night cream (the list goes on) that smells like a bar of Dettol soap dipped in a bath of eucalyptus oil

4367 2018-10-02 15:33:15 The USD was made popular when it became the standard currency for oil trade "Petrodollar"...Saudi Arabia was quite instrumental in achieving this.
4368 2018-10-02 15:33:06 I'm disappointed bro.
4369 2018-10-02 15:32:59 Anong magagawa ni Sass doon may-ari ba sya ng sangkaterbang oil mills sa World Market? All around the world are now facing the same problem. Why can’t you just do some research about the prices of gas around the world and compare? hwag maging IGNORAMUS understand?

4384 2018-10-02 15:31:57 The 1967 'refugees' have only their own leadership2 blame for their current misery 51 yrs later.Given all the millions donated to that cause, an unlimited amount of oil $, why is there still camps of limited everything. Is it because Hamas still needs to blame Israel & kill Jews.

4386 2018-10-02 15:31:48 @ItsJustCricket Congrats to Paul and his partner on the birth of their son Theodore. Please do not use linseed oil or bat wax instead of Sudacrem, they have very different properties. Likewise, vice versa.
Enjoy 
4387 2018-10-02 15:31:45 Ask a gul when is the last time she got her oil changed
4388 2018-10-02 15:31:38 Yes but WHO will do anything about it? Proper-thinking Americans appear powerless at present. Russian money from Semion Mogilevich has infected American Institutions from Trump, Government Officials, GOP, NRA , Lobbyists, Coal, Oil Climate-change Deniers. They’ve taken over USA!
4389 2018-10-02 15:31:36 But she had to rub baby oil on Stephanie’s feet too so where was the time
4390 2018-10-02 15:31:26 Well... he is doing Made in America, similar to what we are doing as Made in India. So each country looking after its own. At the same time, we need to be constantly aware of our weakness - Oil. As long as that exists, we cannot really negotiate & that is distressful anytime.
4391 2018-10-02 15:31:19 If the 'media' hadn't been bashing the Trump Pro-U.S.A. agenda the past 20 months, who knows where the national debt, barely mentioned under x-pres Obamna, might be...  MILITARY 'FIRST', oil dominance (like OPEQ) and infrastructure solutions, next?
4392 2018-10-02 15:31:18 prediction.. if oil and rates stay here..  dow closes red.
4393 2018-10-02 15:31:07 I used the oil for about 3 weeks, but I couldn’t afford to keep buying it. I want to try it consistently though
4394 2018-10-02 15:31:07 With oil prices rising fast which will mean an eventual rise in cost of living, i fear $15 might not be enough

4403 2018-10-02 15:30:35 You while you're having your oil changed and tires rotated: "This is pretty great."

4407 2018-10-02 15:30:20 They were better in that the marinade had more oil than vinegar so it didn't make that choking spittle wad of rope in my throat that large amounts of vinegar makes. I don't know how they got around not listing the ingredients. Maybe that had MSG in there also, I have no idea.

4411 2018-10-02 15:30:14 I have looked. It's Canadian, so will look for a white knight like most Canadian companies do. But not convinced on upside for now. It's leveraged oil sands with unattractive pricing differential. So haven't got that excited.  CNOOC owns 12% but can't acquire it.
4412 2018-10-02 15:30:11 I noticed that you have Cinnamon oil. Is it the same that is used on the Brooms/Pine cones/ Wreaths?

4417 2018-10-02 15:29:51 I have a theory that our climate is currently being affected by the BP oil spill which plunged 200 million gallons of oil into the ocean. Volcanic activity increased since then. To feel the consequences of that event may have taken this long. Lots of oil was not accounted for.
4418 2018-10-02 15:29:45 One would think such is true as I am in the same camp. However, crude is 20% higher in value since Trumps first "threatening" tweet regarding oil $$. So how concerned is he?
4419 2018-10-02 15:29:42 When the Ontario Cannabis Store opens online in 15 days, it will only have a handful of choices and a few types of oil. Very disappointing. Where is all the ... stuff ?
4420 2018-10-02 15:29:38 It’s about living were U work.Instead ofcommenting because the affordability of housing is totally out of reach for the lower to the middle classes.Yet the money is wasted on oil consumption hard currency going overseas, while the environment gets worst for all of US!Close cycle!

4423 2018-10-02 15:29:28 Thankfully, no scarring! I’ll have to try jojoba. Like grape seed oil, jojoba too has a lot of vitamin E in it.
4424 2018-10-02 15:29:24 Fresh wash, shine, oil change & a full tank of gas. My baby is shining & looking like a boujee bihhh
4425 2018-10-02 15:29:22 At least classic cars aren't a necessity.  I think it's far more of a problem when the rich invest in homes or oil futures, driving up housing and gas prices.  Classic cars would have a very small effect on the used car market, but probably not enough to really effect prices.
4426 2018-10-02 15:29:22 It’s almost price gouging. Hotels know that guys need to be in the oil field and there’s just not many hotels

It smells like home.
4437 2018-10-02 15:28:27 Can we just round up all those that think this is a good idea and move them to their own little island/deep sea oil rig?
4438 2018-10-02 15:28:24 "Do you have your phone? Do you have gas? Have you checked your oil? Should you take some sunglasses? Do you need a water? How about a snack?"Lol Every. Single. Time.

4440 2018-10-02 15:28:11 Yes, going off to shoot brown people so the country can control oil is a lot like not knowing where your next meal is coming from.
4441 2018-10-02 15:28:09 Looks like the all problems in this country hinges on crude price ....btw  have you heard of oil bonds ?
4442 2018-10-02 15:27:50 Valvoline really has the audacity to send you a “$10 off your next oil change” that expires a month after 
4443 2018-10-02 15:27:49 And the government has said that they want profits for their industries even if it is harmful for the world.  Palm Oil, Pesticides, Chemicals for Fracking and Tar Sands, Selling weapons to any countries in conflicts.
And don't forget to send $$ to be laundered in our banks.(NGO)
4444 2018-10-02 15:27:43 How come you conspiracy kooks are all over #pizzagate  and Las Vegas conspiracies but when the catholic churches in Pennsylvania rape/abuse over a 1,000 children you're silent, and when oil  companies steal peoples land you're silent, then when someone kneels  you're outraged?

4453 2018-10-02 15:26:38 When I was 22, I thought I'd be a responsible car owner and get an oil change at JL. They promised a 20 minute turnaround, so I went before work. The guy came back and said "Hey , how about we do your rear differential fluid, too?" and I'm like "sure! I'm being responsible!"
4454 2018-10-02 15:26:35 Why not a mandate on hiring women in oil fields, logging operations or trash trucks? Those are the positions actually dominated by men.
4455 2018-10-02 15:26:29 Yep; just like with Helsinki remarks; edited out.  @realDonaldTrump is all smoke & mirrors & his minions cover him & help fraud USA.  He is doing to country what he did with his casinos in Atlantic City, all while bragging, stretching the truth & snake oil salesman w his cult.
4456 2018-10-02 15:26:19 No! I grew up in South Fla. & love walking on the beach. Visiting Santa Barbara near @UCSB  I walked on the beach with my daughter, seeing the Oil Platforms off on the distance. Once we finished our walk, both of the soles of our feet were black from tar, never saw on the surface

4479 2018-10-02 15:24:44 Bumper crop with fewer buyers will make prices low and plants will store good quantity of seeds at much lower prices.  Rupee is weakening so soya meal exports realisations will be much higher and due to weak rupee imported edible oil will be expensive.  Both plus for plants

4502 2018-10-02 15:22:36 What kinda oil are you using
4503 2018-10-02 15:22:29 Makes sense, however big oil is good at undermaintaining where not regulated, & always choose the cheapest route irregaurdless of local & political fallout, meaning they're too used to having it all, all the time.
 Maybe we're turning a corner here?
4504 2018-10-02 15:22:26 If you need Road Salt, we have Oil Well Brine that is approved for use on Roads that we can ship to you in Hazardous Waste Trucks.

State Courts have ruled that certain Concerned Citizens are not allowed to mention the Arsenic & Radioactivity in the brine. Sounds safe $$ to me.

4530 2018-10-02 15:20:08 The price of oil is going through the roof because of Trump. Coincidentally Putin desperately needed the price of oil to rebound and it has. Nice going. You were saying something about our future?????
4531 2018-10-02 15:20:07 @TrampaMusic u need a CBD oil with a % of THC otherwise it won't work. But even in the Netherlands this is illegal. CBD doesn't make u feel the high it the healing part of the cannabis plant. Or u can use a vape

4591 2018-10-02 15:14:06 Yeah, if oil prices keep going up this trend won't last. That said, because MPG doesn't scale linearly the best Tacoma still has ~40% higher annual fuel costs ($2,350) than the worst Corolla ($1,400)

Being a student of petroleum engg I know well,Oil prices at ur time were 35$ per barrel  and now the oil price in global market is round about 75$ per barrel

4688 2018-10-02 15:06:36 #PalmOil causes havoc to Indonesian forests&wildlife. @PepsiCo fuels this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT in calling CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes!
So be #brave, be #realistic and quit #profiting @IndraNooyi
4689 2018-10-02 15:06:33 The only realistic option for climate change deniers and oil pundits is status quo.
4690 2018-10-02 15:06:31 @UN warns of famine in #Yemen

Ok,why beside the warning,it put practical visions that ensure that people do not reach famine and take effective measures such as lifting the siege,opening airports,exporting oil and gas, returning the bank to the capital & stopping the aggression.
4691 2018-10-02 15:06:28 According to #desi #parents any kind of sickness can be fixed by parachute coconut oil and 10+ hrs of sleep.

4693 2018-10-02 15:06:20 NL was shielded from 2009 recession because of mega projects here so unemployment was actually near record low then. 2016 was when oil prices fell to $26 & recovered quickly but that on top of MF fiasco was trigger to the current debt crises that I am warning about.

4696 2018-10-02 15:06:07 You think $100 would sig slow oil demand, say if we get average $100 oil price in 2019 what would you envisage global demand growth to be?

4701 2018-10-02 15:05:51 Oil is traded in dollar so even if we bought from Nigeria or Angola we'd still be buying in dollar. Gaddafi wanted to change this but the Americans killed him.
4702 2018-10-02 15:05:45 It's like someone dipped his brain in breading and then tossed the whole thing into boiling cooking oil
4703 2018-10-02 15:05:42 I’ve been due for an oil change since June too and every time I drive, I get scared my car is just gonna give out in the middle of the road.
4704 2018-10-02 15:05:39 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Plz tweet out discontent w the Big oil companies jacking up the price of oil so fast and for no other reason than pure greed. If gas at the pump reaches $3 this great economy is O. V. E. R.

4709 2018-10-02 15:05:21 The situation in Gaza is weird. No Israeli presence, open border to Egypt. Why won't the Gazans elect a constructive government and make their land the most prosperous in the Middle East? The international community will help, the Arab oil countries will help, Israel will help.

4714 2018-10-02 15:05:06 The Great thing about @realDonaldTrump is if he can't talk Oil down, he'll use the Opportunity to Build some refineries here in America. Last one was built 41yrs ago.  @DonaldJTrumpJr

4727 2018-10-02 15:04:28 The higher the risk, the higher the reward. Oil is only a single indicator, gold is down 10% in last 6 months.
4728 2018-10-02 15:04:24 That doesn't work either! Multinationals own and control most of the planet's grain, soya, palm oil, rice production etc. & distribution. Grow your own I reckon so this year its been spuds, toms, garlic, lettuce, radish, runner beans - and lots of eggs from our lovely chooks.

4730 2018-10-02 15:04:10 it will go below that gap! There won't be ANY further discussions on Fracking for MONTHs, the pump is over. Back to reality for QC oil and gas! Even if they do discuss, this will end up in the courts. So, DEAD MONEY!

4735 2018-10-02 15:04:01 Oil is up 20% in the first six months of the year & gasoline prices are at a four-year high. A Corolla gets 11mpg (16mpg highway) more than the Tacoma -- and the Tacoma is just a wimpy Hilux anyway :)

4744 2018-10-02 15:03:02 Sell to Germany, give them a reason to cut off the pipeline from Russia. Germany, a NATO partner, is undercutting the NATO alliance by buying oil from the very country that caused NATO to be formed in the first place.

4746 2018-10-02 15:02:50 That's midday madness! Looks like they might have scraped some oil off the tracks at Euston as relish for good measure. What's next, Roadkill Rosti at Watford Gap Services on the M1?
4747 2018-10-02 15:02:45 The epitome of hack. It just bugs me sooooo much that they advertise her as a conservative. GTFOH
4748 2018-10-02 15:02:42 There is simply no need for every recipe on the internet to start with guzzles of olive oil and ONIONS!
4749 2018-10-02 15:02:42 There's no direct evidence they had to do that.
In business there's plenty of variables, the one highlighted in Calgary media lost a good percentage of his swanky customer base when the oil crunch happened, & did he adjust? Nope, but he did find a political scapegoat.

4778 2018-10-02 15:00:03 people from the US coming in here and complaining about olive oil and honey being expensive.. well yeah you came to one of the very few countries that produces olive oil, do you expect to get the same prices as your country like?!? and its also a normal price for us here.
4779 2018-10-02 15:00:01 The leaders of the countries w/emerging economies must steer their countries away from too much dependence on volatile oil and encourage policies that give a larger share of energy demand to less volatile & predictably priced natural gas.

4781 2018-10-02 14:59:43 @CNBCTV18Live I have a feeling that US is pressurising India to toe their stand on Iran oil by indiscriminate selling in Indian share markets and claiming India as Tariff king. It has to be seen how India handles it.
4782 2018-10-02 14:59:38 Buy the rumor, sell the facts. Not surprised one bit that natgas equities are selling off, expected actually. $XEG / $SPTTEN / $ZEO giving back all their gains from yesterday and then some. Also not surprised by this with the differentials blowing out on Canadian oil.

4791 2018-10-02 14:59:02 @realDonaldTrump Ever since we passed legislation to allow exports of petroleum products the price of oil has marched steadily higher. It isn't just OPEC. Something is  going on here!
4792 2018-10-02 14:59:01 @MbSofKSA it is not as simple as turning the dial to increase output.   Investment is required to produce more oil and then move to markets.  It will not happen fast.
4793 2018-10-02 14:59:00 @Badermasaker Assalamu alaikkum,this is my suggestion..did you think Crud oil finished in GCC countries what to do,or mostly countries planing to stop petroleum and desal car and they are planning to use electrical car GCC countries have to think and take action for future income
4794 2018-10-02 14:58:55 Lmao grande mixes all of our oils and does half olive oil with whatever other oil we have and they come out fine store bought ice cream cake is much easier.

4798 2018-10-02 14:58:29 she was always pathetic.  she was never  "conservative"
4799 2018-10-02 14:58:13 With new technologies coming out, there is no more need for oil or gas in the next five years.  Hence, it is never worthwhile to put too much mony in oil/gas exploration, much less sacrifice national pride n dignity for a commodity worth nothing in the coming years.

4840 2018-10-02 14:54:20 @MbSofKSA Mr Trump still thinks that OPEC controls price.  I know this is not true.  In 1997 imported oil was more than 50% of USA's supply.  We are now the number 1 producer and are only about 2 years away from being an exporter.
4841 2018-10-02 14:54:18 Oil. And the major passage way through water for other major exporters.

4850 2018-10-02 14:53:30 Don’t forget our energy dominance now it would be crushed by regulations put back on it by the radicals in the Democratic Party we would go back to dependence on OPEC oil again. Though they would probably soon force us to buy electric cars and get rid of all gas operated ones.
4851 2018-10-02 14:53:30 He said he heard that somebody was calling around asking questions about an accusation but he didn't know what that accusation specifically was.
4852 2018-10-02 14:53:18 Do you homestly believe this only comes from canada? Look to our neighbour.  What about the hundreds of ships docking to ship oil already? The marine life doesnt stay in the strait only, they have migrated from down south.

4856 2018-10-02 14:52:53 Lying by omission or intentionally misleading phrasing is, indeed, lying. He lied also when he said he’d not heard of the Ramirez allegations until the NYer story. There are texts that prove him to be lying there. Also, “Ralph Club” is about your weak stomach? Ok, guy.
4857 2018-10-02 14:52:49 I believe the role OPEC is playing today, will be played by International Solar Alliance in time to come as far as world's energy requirement are concerned. Role being played by oil wells today will one day be played by sun rays: PM at 1st assembly of International Solar Alliance

4875 2018-10-02 14:51:24 Where? Quote me the lie? Find a quote from Kavanaugh that is a lie. The worst you can say is that he downplayed it. He said "sometimes I had too many beers". The most weaselly thing he said was about the drinking age, but even there he didn't say HE was drinking legally.
4876 2018-10-02 14:51:24 running out of people to mediate any conflict these days that have good hearts that don't have vested interests in selling weapons vying for oil  and keeping this rumbling on
4877 2018-10-02 14:51:20 CBD Oil is a great treatment for opiate withdrawal.

Very very low, to little, THC levels and is great for addressing many issues involved with addiction issues.

The numerous studies are readily available. A simple Google search will produce them.
4878 2018-10-02 14:51:18 The oil pipeline was stopped but the sewer pipelines that spew human waste ito the St. Lawrence River are going strong.

4913 2018-10-02 14:48:09 Ok fair enough. I concede the point, then. However, there is certainly evidence of Kavanaugh lying several times to clean up his alcohol use. To point out her hypocrisy on the issue is also to expose your own.

4977 2018-10-02 14:44:23 It means nako-compromise ang lipid barrier mo, yung protective layer ng oil/fat kung saan naka-embed ang top layer ng skin. When it happens, puwede kang magka-trans-epidermal water loss at pasukan ng irritants, so your sebaceous glands overcompensate by producing more oil.

4979 2018-10-02 14:44:14 The palm oil sector is not seing a rise in productivity. Total output increased simply because more land was converted into plantations. The oil extraction rate has also remained static throughout the 10-year period.
4980 2018-10-02 14:44:12 Coconut oil and condition everyday! 
4981 2018-10-02 14:44:10 I intend to. And when Republican's cry that we need oil and gas for our cars etc remember this isn't the end of gas and oil extraction it's just asking that they slow down. We can laugh at "conservative" tears like they like say about liberals.
4982 2018-10-02 14:44:08 There’s no tax break for the middle class at all. Paid 19% 2017, figuring out this year going to be paying 25%. Tax break my ass. Middle class is abt gone. It’s rich and poor. Save anything hahaha not if you want wood/oil to be warm, food to feed family..etc.. #trumplies
4983 2018-10-02 14:44:07 2/ To destroy competition and to give oil rich Golan Heights to #Israel . We won't rest until the world knows the truth & we are many.

4995 2018-10-02 14:43:03 GHG's?? Canada produces nothing in terms of world GHG balance. We could stop oil+gas, it makes no diff to world GHG or climate, none. Your moment of light on LNG is good! Yrs of NDP attack, U now know LNG is good for BC..  It's a bit disingenuous on your part but that's politics.

5045 2018-10-02 14:39:19 Canada is a nation of no risk investors. Stability has returned to the largest trading block in the world. An oil rich nation sees the price of Crude on the rise. But we are afraid of Italian banks failing. 
Pussy's to man.

5071 2018-10-02 14:37:33 Apologies.exact numbers on Saudi oil were 15.2 million petrol and 15.1 million diesel used as 13 days petrol and 6 days diesel. This was govt to govt deal, cheaper than market price.
5072 2018-10-02 14:37:29 The Saudi oil is finished already? We expected it to go down

5105 2018-10-02 14:34:41 I had the exact some problem, worked so well but is just so expensive. I found an indie company called Lucy Minerals. She is based out of Winter Haven Florida but will ship anywhere. I bought the Vitamin C serum and the Ambrosia Oil for a 3rd of the price. I am never going back.

5107 2018-10-02 14:34:35 Prices at the pump matter. Very large disconnect on wall street. I get sick with business channels cheering higher oil and they do, everyday.

5109 2018-10-02 14:34:32 @realDonaldTrump Hi POTUS , request you to control the oil price and bring it below 70 dollars
5110 2018-10-02 14:34:31 Thought experiment: remove things in your life that come from oil: medical devices, air travel, cell phones, power, light switches, lubes, safety glass, computers, etc. Now, list the materials that would replace them, IF ANY: glass, metals, animal fats, etc. Do it quickly?
5111 2018-10-02 14:34:24 I used to make nobake oatmeal/peanut butter/ coconut oil  treats for my German Shepard she loved them I found them on Pinterest

5144 2018-10-02 14:31:40 This article seems to co-mingle to need for propane with the tax and employment benefits of the combined oil/gas that currently runs thru the line.

5298 2018-10-02 14:15:48 You can conquer oil fields through war, you can't acquire knowledge that way.

5357 2018-10-02 14:09:53 Producers with LNG facilities will capture a higher price for their gas, same as today oil companies with firm pipe capacity can capture US gulf coast prices for oil. Overall impact on prices comes from adding big new demand to the market, but marginal GJ still linked to US mkt.

5362 2018-10-02 14:09:30 I think we should also look at USD to INR conversation rate. That is a major reason in increase of oil prices. I think when the FM has said then that point in time USD to INR should have been fairly low.

5388 2018-10-02 14:06:59 I am split on the whole issue. I know we're a long way off from fossil independence, so I see why we need it today. Better pipeline than train. But I've heard a lot of stories about when the oil companies moved out of AB , they left a mess. That should not be allowed to happen.

5398 2018-10-02 14:06:12 Much of the world looks at the US as a kind of mythical omnipotent force that lurks behind all kinds of global events, pulling strings. Americans look at OPEC in the same way in terms of the oil market. Saudi has immense power, but the market can certainly move beyond its control

5423 2018-10-02 14:04:19 Trerrible idea. Time to move on to renewables. Oil and gas are filthy fossil fuels that are destroying our environment. Renewables create more jobs and don’t threaten our oceans and coastlines. No more dirty fossil fuels.

5442 2018-10-02 14:02:05 The way to support this will be to deal with the companies that transit through Zimbabwe through some registration between them oil companies/ board and establish a transparent and accountable system. I guess that they  have a good system of management.

5507 2018-10-02 13:55:06 For 7 straight years, the US has pumped more oil & gas out of the ground than any other country.

5522 2018-10-02 13:53:42 ( if you are not allergic) ladies mix few dropes of almond oil, mustard oil , coconut oil , olive or castor oils all together or one or two kind. Warm few seconds and massage an hour before wash.This will give health and shine to your hair and a great massage. Best for dryness

5525 2018-10-02 13:53:30 Also, what I’m saying is don’t just slap and blame the government.  Oil has just become too expensive. Take it or leave it.

5545 2018-10-02 13:51:36 There's a technique our maid from Malawi taught me

Line the bottom of pot with straw (makes it easier to flip over when you fry)

Add very little water, oil and vegies all at once
5546 2018-10-02 13:51:33 This is broadly similar to how I do tomato sauce (I tend not to cook with beef). Things I do differently in mine: 

* Butter is better than olive oil in basically everything.
* Marmite is a great choice for the salty, umami, fermented thing.
* Pressure cookers are amazing.
5547 2018-10-02 13:51:32 yeah oil has gone up by a gazilion. breakevens got some catching up to do
5548 2018-10-02 13:51:23 Given RHI evidence today about the loss of business to oil and gas suppliers, I cant help but wonder if the gas and oil suppliers had to levy additional costs against domestic users.....like you and me.
5549 2018-10-02 13:51:15 Ha Ha Ha!!!K.S oil ??? once upon a time ks oil was a good choice. I have 4000 shares of ks oil @68 RS and now today price is 0.50 Rs. I purchased this stock between 2009-2009. still wondering why ???

5555 2018-10-02 13:50:46 Sorry to hear that. I went to truck training school Nd couldn't go there due to CDB oil being in my system. I'm a Disabled Veteran who drove heavy equipment in the Army. They also wont take you on pain meds. I suffered so bad and got down to 1 pill a day. So I could sleep.
5556 2018-10-02 13:50:35 But I’m also glad that people in other countries were able to give canola oil a chance. If they had stuck to their parochialism, Western Canadian ag would be a lot poorer.

5565 2018-10-02 13:49:59 I couldn't possibly say if that is the case or not. But I think if the ratio of male to female employees is 5:1 in the oil & gas sector and the ratio of male to female speakers at an oil &  gas panel is 5:1, that sounds "in line" as opposed to say 5:0 which is often the case

5579 2018-10-02 13:48:21 @SRuhle plus no mention of oil. On old NAFTA Canada has to sell oil to USA at a certain price. Under new NAFTA 2 Canada sells oil to USA at higher price. No mention of this. Canada keeps Chapter 19 no mention of that.

I need to ask them about it.
5586 2018-10-02 13:47:33 Well Lagos is actually enjoying, as compared to other States..

5598 2018-10-02 13:46:19 Folk are whinging about the #BritishGas prices rise. What about the increase in domestic oil price - about 35% higher than this time last year. Who speaks up for the many many oil users?
5599 2018-10-02 13:46:17 I agree. At least block chain gurus are selling snake oil tech, whereas altcoin-is-the-better-bitcoin gurus are selling nothing but "get rich quick by giving me all your money" scams.

Long run, both are good for BTC so no worries

5605 2018-10-02 13:45:48 I would do the squash away from the heat so they cook more gently, basting with something often during cooking - coriander and garlic spiked olive oil perhaps? They need a really slow start to soften, then move them to higher heat to glaze a bit with the oil.

At least that oil has been used what about billions of gallons spilt each year during transport?

5662 2018-10-02 13:39:57 My wife went to @NTB this morning for an oil change appointment she scheduled in advance. They tell her it’ll be a 2.5 hour wait even though she has an appointment. I thought the point of appointments was so you didn’t have to wait??  Did I miss something?

5666 2018-10-02 13:39:38 I see the Senate is busy passing important bills: campus fire safety awareness month, sickle cell awareness month, opening reserved land to oil drilling companies. So, the Senate is still doing “important” things

5682 2018-10-02 13:38:28 I’m not one to brag but I bought gas yesterday at $2.69 knowing oil was moving up and the same station was $2.95 within two hours. #winning
5683 2018-10-02 13:38:20 What I don't get is that most people from East Tennessee sided with the Union. It's like they're sheep that listen to the latest snake oil salesman. I'm from Knoxville and I don't understand it.
5684 2018-10-02 13:38:15 Google/YouTube is your friend. Serviced my car and the mechanic didn't know how to reset the oil life. I waited there for over 30mins for his "oga". Something just told me to check YouTube and gbam I did it myself. Same thing with my tire pressure indicator
5685 2018-10-02 13:38:10 The rise in Crude oil price is increasing every day in the International market and that necessitates Indian petroleum companies simultaneous increase in Petroleum Products#But that can be controlled by reducing taxes by the Centre and States.Time for PM and FM to interfere.
5686 2018-10-02 13:38:05 Great ideas already but I am a fan of vegetable soups - fry an onion and stick of celery in a small amount of oil as a base, add low carb vegetables of choice ( literally any or a random mix from the bottom of the fridge), powdered stock, boil until soft, stick blend and season.
5687 2018-10-02 13:37:56 So a SUV pulls on to the lot. A buff marine tells me he needs an oil change. I walk him in. I walk to the car and start up the engine.
"We got this together" just starts playing as loud as can be. 

I can't tell my co-workers why i left the car laughing. Now I look like a maniac.

5798 2018-10-02 13:28:00 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

5801 2018-10-02 13:27:46 TT, the only thing that will help us in these #FuelHikes, it is the ANC led government to put the levies and RAF on ice until Trump stop provoking the crude oil producing countries.

5802 2018-10-02 13:27:37 I should probably take it in, because I just got the oil changed so maybe there’s some sort of other problem.. :/
5803 2018-10-02 13:27:33 We don't suggest to vape a true oil, as it can lead to a condition known as lipid pneumonia, because our lungs are not built to inhale true oils or fats. If you want to vape CBD use CBD crystals :)

5811 2018-10-02 13:27:11 Number one concern for oil majors is "peak demand". High oil prices will not attract loads of new investment in OPEC nations, to the contrary, as it will push the perception of peak demand closer to date.

5813 2018-10-02 13:27:07 Where is the cheap oil from Saudi Arabia? Zambia is full of miracles......
5814 2018-10-02 13:27:01 Tourism and mining can coexist.

1. Camouflaged oil wells LA style.

2. Dubai. Surpassed Heathrow

3. Russian tourists and North Korean campers can be persuaded to visit the mines.
5815 2018-10-02 13:27:00 How could we have got it so wrong? These 2 are leaders. We have a bunch of selfish self serving puffed up ignorant snake oil salesmen. We are living under an alien occupation.

5820 2018-10-02 13:26:35 Shred them. Blanch them. Then sauté them in olive oil with craisins. Serve with crumbled walnuts.
5821 2018-10-02 13:26:24 It might be, but from what I've gathered from using it is that it's just plain castor oil. Plain castor oil is also good for your hair but if you want jbco which is better for your hair then stay away from it.
5822 2018-10-02 13:26:23 @SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump the Iran sanctions help noone but the Russians and OPEC countries. Hurt America. This is bad policy and the higher oil prices will all but ensure democrats big wins in the midterms. Good going republicans. #OOTT

5826 2018-10-02 13:25:47 @j_bindra I came across coindesk after searching more about consensus and then got to know about DCG and Grayscale trust. They are making investments to create more exposure towards digital currencies. For eg creating an ethereum classic trust or GBTC just like a gold or oil ETF.

5858 2018-10-02 13:23:18 Oil: WTI crude sprinted past $75 to its highest level since November 2014. One of the reasons? The trade deal between the North American countries calmed fears of lower demand...from the Morning Brew
5859 2018-10-02 13:23:07 transport network? If train/rail system was not retired in 1968 this type of dystopian would not exist today. oil/gas dependency. fact is, rail system probably would've been connected across whole country by now since we had the engineers to accomplish that; way back then.

Namely, geopolitical (strategic) advantage and gas and oil (*Genie.)

5949 2018-10-02 13:16:24 Interesting.  Fed repeated this in 2008 when oil spiked to $147 in June 2008.  Also, remember that Greenspan refused to lower rates until after the Bush-Gore election was decided... thus losing 2 months of Fed action.

6077 2018-10-02 13:03:48 Lord, today You know what I need to do,
But You can do more in my waiting than in my doing I could do.
So I won’t run anymore.
I’m waiting on You.

Oh, my soul,
Wait upon the Lord.
Keep your lamp filled with oil.
Oh, my soul,
Be not deceived!
Wait for Him.

6079 2018-10-02 13:03:39 Oil is not to be hated, it is just not to be burned. This isn't hard, the storms and flooding and fires are coming from carbon in the air, the life system is becoming unbalanced from heat. This is not a popularity contest.

6201 2018-10-02 12:51:58 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
6202 2018-10-02 12:51:57 Essential oils can be diluted effectively with alcohol, and witch hazel extract is often alcohol based, as someone who has a natural product label a 10% essential oil content in alcohol is actually half-strength, I think it's actually okay :)
6203 2018-10-02 12:51:50 @ErikaAriasFOX61 What happened to the story about CBD oil?

6205 2018-10-02 12:51:29 Ueah, they love him. Anything to limit our production and make us buy their oil.
6206 2018-10-02 12:51:28 Total rubbish! UK does not import 'masses of Gas' and the ShaleGas imported is primarily used to produce a product that is totally 
POLLUTING OUR PLANET!

6208 2018-10-02 12:51:26 UPA WAS DRIVEN BY THE INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES INCREASES UPTO 120 BARREL...THEY SHIRKED RESPONSIBILITIES AND LINKED INTERNATIONAL PRICES TO LOCAL TO PETRO-DIESEL PRICES. WHEN OIL PRICES TUMBLED DOWN TO $30  BARREL, NDA GOVT. DID NOT REDUCE PRICES TO ₹46 PER LITRE-RAISED TO ₹90
6209 2018-10-02 12:51:19 When you are sanctioned by the FED fiat currency starts to be a problem, specially the USD. Have you seen Maduro yesterday? They announced a new whitepage for the crypto scam "Petro" that's supposed to be backed by oil.

6211 2018-10-02 12:51:13 2/2 it was a tricky negotiation with is employer the WorldCouncil of Churches but all came out right in the end, as The Rhine froze that year and no more oil could be delivered to Switzerland. We had a huge Christmas tree that year with real candles all over it

6215 2018-10-02 12:51:01 And Ireland. And India. And Botswana. And Cyprus. Yes they have form. 
Personally I think we should be letting them keep 90% of the oil in year 1, 80% in year 2 and so on. Otherwise I think things could get ugly.
6216 2018-10-02 12:50:53 @Clubmed @bobskate and there is dime a dozen folks selling fish oil products who will use these result to pump their products.  Cautious gl
6217 2018-10-02 12:50:53 In some far-off, pure-electric automotive future, the concept of sending someone off for a head gasket or oil filter will be just as ludicrous as blinker fluid. 
6218 2018-10-02 12:50:52 Just like with Venezuela, the untold story has to do with these nations' offshore OIL, and how U.S. OIL'igarchs seek to seize and profit off of it via clandestine interventions, boycotts, sanctions, fiscal contraints, regime changes, puppets. As always, follow the mammon.

6235 2018-10-02 12:48:51 time as support for North Sea oil, nuclear and fracking, show that the Tory cuts are ideological, not sensible, and that the Tories are still the same old fossil fuel and nuclear addicts who disingenuously want to hoodwink the international community into thinking (4)
6236 2018-10-02 12:48:50 That is true. In Texas if we come at restricting fossil fuels we will also lose. Nuance is important. We can be against fracking, we can be against big oil but we have to be realistic.
6237 2018-10-02 12:48:33 Finally the govt realises that building a big oil refinery will bring down our export bill by at least $8 billion. #CPEC

6253 2018-10-02 12:47:21 What she told me was actually oily skin lah perlukan hydration sebab your skin inside is dry and that's why they keep on producing more oil and hence, jadi lah oily skin. Time tu lah baru faham. Lol. And now baca skincare tips on twitter pun they're saying the same thing.

6282 2018-10-02 12:45:00 Canada: a country where exporting from the West coast oil that's subject to labour and environmental laws is immoral & outrageous, but where importing environmentally rapacious dictator oil to the East coast is virtuous & right.
6283 2018-10-02 12:44:52 But tend to think that it won’t cause a regime change though (especially since oil price is quiet high compared during 2014-2016 price crash).

6332 2018-10-02 12:39:52 Quite unfortunate but with better management and a more reasonable exchange rate (relative to the last time oil was $100) we can actually do something good with this opportunity before the next oil price dip.

Key phrase: better management.

Surely, there are needs in ND that are not being addressed. When big oil and gas are done, ND will be environmentally dead. Natives suffer!

6404 2018-10-02 12:31:20 We are gradually loosing our culture and it's really disheartening, I just saw one dude washing his hands after eating "puff puff" instead of rubbing it on his head like anointing oil.
6405 2018-10-02 12:31:16 It sounds crazy but hear me out. In the next 30 years, the population will peak at 9.8 billion. The planet can sustain around 10 billion people with food and clean drinking water. We will run out of oil and gas in about 50 years. We need to adapt quickly.

That's a contrast to petrol/oil although both are commodities and I am contradicting my own argument but life is full of contradictions. Why tax cars but not airplanes?
6435 2018-10-02 12:28:01 PS - Under NAFTA / USMCA Canada is obliged to supply the USA with 75% of its oil and 50% of its natural gas.  So that source may as well be American.

6466 2018-10-02 12:24:20 @elonmusk Disapprove of the SEC’s decision. As chairman trying to get the world off big oil and into the 21st century, it feels like you’re being overtly scrutinized. Twitter shouldn’t be dubbed as an official channel of communications. Just look at POTUS tweets! #1dayteslaowner

6474 2018-10-02 12:22:58 Trerrible idea. Time to move on to renewables. Oil and gas are filthy fossil fuels that are destroying our environment. Renewables create more jobs and don’t threaten our oceans and coastlines. No more dirty fossil fuels.
6475 2018-10-02 12:22:44 I've got that but the oil though, do I just dab it on or?
6476 2018-10-02 12:22:35 I googled it and it said there’s no difference that a lot of people replace vegetable oil with olive oil after I had already put it in the cake and it was a big ass difference  whatever I tried

6593 2018-10-02 12:09:03 You get an oil change, then  you notice your car is leaking oil and you continue to drive it?  Didn't the vehicle's warning system show low oil?  Firestone at fault, but serious damage could have been avoided with driver awareness.

6795 2018-10-02 11:44:44 “America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of crude oil.”

6869 2018-10-02 11:35:40 I like the analogy with Oil.. Individuals rarely do something (themselves) with crude Oil.. Still individuals can trade it or speculate on more usage and higher prices. Multiple industries can use oil.. for chemicals or plastics, or fuel obviously.. 1/2

6890 2018-10-02 11:32:39 I actually think it will have to be forced upon people by governments - when the economic and health economics costs reach crippling levels (we are getting there!) - reducing meat and dairy will be the only way - just as lead-free petrol was given go-ahead against oil lobby.
6891 2018-10-02 11:32:37 We do not have to listen to anyone!! Y can’t Gambia government come out and clear the air about the Oil deal and Semlex!!

6902 2018-10-02 11:30:12 Do people not believe in this oil rally? Earnings revisions didn’t help this year, but you’d think they would look through that to the supply deficit we’ll be running into in 12-24 months. Somebody has to get the oil out of the ground.

6912 2018-10-02 11:28:46 Not any time soon. Political structures are hard to bring down like that, especially when ‘oil still dey’. Asiwaju will probably hand it over to his blood when he’s done. A going concern. See the Sarakis for example.

6919 2018-10-02 11:28:12 Totally get this. Labour are far more likely to encourage a diverse manufacturing and industrial base with protections as well as reducing energy imports reliance. That people ignore Vz's food reliance, oil dependence, energy imports and FX borrowing is beyond me.

7064 2018-10-02 11:08:36 What particular policy did Jonathan implement to double the economy in five years? And why did the growth rate drop by 50% every quarter when oil prices crashed? Truth we are too dependent on oil prices till now. That's the main problem

7068 2018-10-02 11:07:43 I think they’ve changed the formula to now have it pegged to a basket of commodities (not solely oil) including Gold & Iron Ore. Perhaps the Petro is more of a 1923 Rentenmark as opposed to a Helfferich rye currency (that wasn’t pursued) which was actually redeemable in Marks.

7090 2018-10-02 11:05:21 It is massive, but it is hardly new. Chinese consumption of olive oil has been rising for decades. Spanish, Italian and Greek exporters have developed significant markets there, as have Turkish.

US went to war with Iraq over oil, not because Israel said so.
Europeans are very progressive hence they don't like the US.

7185 2018-10-02 10:49:10 @narendramodi @AmitShah @rajnathsingh @arunjaitley Sir, request to look at the oil price. If you don't want to take a hit on excise collection. Then talk to OMC for giving subsidy. At least 4 diesel.

 Else reduce excise and take dividend from OMC. Think Sir election year.

7199 2018-10-02 10:46:48 the hotel we booked smells like mold so we all put peppermint oil under our noses to avoid the smell and now it burns...everyone is freaking out.
7200 2018-10-02 10:46:32 The currency of the oil trade is in dollars. Yuan was examined as a replacement by both SA and Russia back in Obama days and was abandoned. With venezuella in dire straits   Iran can hope for trading in cut throat deals
7201 2018-10-02 10:46:24 I’ve been using miracle drops, go growth, vitamin e & coconut oil. Me and my baby hair growing. 
7202 2018-10-02 10:46:22 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
7203 2018-10-02 10:46:20 Excellent work. Have you found your season is longer in recent years and  does the increased sunshine add or decrease intensity of smell/oil. Hope you don't mind the questions.

7205 2018-10-02 10:45:49 So you can't answer why you will vote for the  SNP but you don't believe their figures , you actually think they are lying to you . The SNP Government don't want you to know about the missing billions from oil you claim there is . The Unionist SNP are hiding the billions 
7206 2018-10-02 10:45:27 If independence is going to save us it won’t be relying on oil. You had better find another tune for your drum.

7210 2018-10-02 10:45:06 Never a bad idea! Lots of oil massages and some healing time won't hurt.
7211 2018-10-02 10:44:39 I think we are too way ahead, a lot of people are just starting to become aware of medicinal healing plants and think it’s only “medical” cannibas that heals people. Shame that big pharma will be cashing in on cannibas oil soon
7212 2018-10-02 10:44:34 This is excellent news. Research on this should be done as there holds much promise for both med marij. and CBD oil. You have my support.

7226 2018-10-02 10:42:10 Oil price is now around $84 a barrel. Norway was still making around $10 billion a year in oil taxes when it was at $50 a barrel. The problem is the UK’s approach to oil taxation.

7233 2018-10-02 10:41:03 Is this the 1980s?  Such nonsense! Sure, limit sugar, processed foods and eliminate trans fats, but there’s absolutely nothing wrong with saturated fats, eggs and coconut oil. Vegetable oils should be avoided though.

7258 2018-10-02 10:36:17 Oga, prospect is prospect and not reality.

The prospect didn't project oil falling as low as $38/b.

The prospect didn't envisage a plunge from 6.3% GDP in 2013 to 4.7% in 2014 &2.3% by 2nd qtr 2015.

7314 2018-10-02 10:27:06 #DonaldTrump  American economy was booming due to lower oil prices, now that the prices have been artificially rigged,  economy will soon sputter.
7315 2018-10-02 10:27:03 Worldwide US dollar strengthening and oil prices up temporarily! So economy is in tough sailing, naturally more criticism ! By Jan 2019 things will get corrected and that’s the time we will surely talk loud on Modiji’s achievements!

7326 2018-10-02 10:25:12 All these little idiocies - disruption to power (political and electrical) in Northern Ireland, authorisation before traveling to the EU, manufacturing problems, food supply - would be bad enough on their own. 

That they may well coincide with a hike in oil prices is awkward
7327 2018-10-02 10:25:12 Maybe but oil is going great! Maybe it will reach $170 a barrel just like it did 2007

7333 2018-10-02 10:24:18 @arunjaitley GOI should make electric car GST free because you will require less dollars for oil import second you will help environment..
7334 2018-10-02 10:24:13 So you know we’ve been ripped off but don’t have the baws to admit it...’we are where we are’. Very matter of fact response to us getting reemed. No matter...we don’t need the oil for independence...it’ll be a wee bonus though

7341 2018-10-02 10:22:56 Ironically its an issue of the US's own making.  As soon as "oil independence" became a reality.  There was no need to for the US to export as many dollars as before.  And with the FED in QT mode.  The rest of the world cant rely on the US as sole reserve CCY
7342 2018-10-02 10:22:48 @tomkeene oil is at 85... which month and what flavour do you mean?
7343 2018-10-02 10:22:26 People can say what they want but Michael has a valid point. There is a reason why Turkana gets 15% of oil revenue. If you don't know the why don't use this as an example to support a warped logic.

7346 2018-10-02 10:22:05 Strange to see @PEPANZ1 claiming that the New Zealand government doesn't have a "transition plan".

If there's someone missing a transition plan, it's the oil and gas lobby, still fighting a desperate rearguard action against the arc of history and need for net zero emissions.

7386 2018-10-02 10:16:35 Oil has fluctuated down to a point where it is uneconomic to extract from North Sea. Rigs are being decommissioned and not replaced. The Scottish industry is shrinking while cheap oil and gas available world wide. Is this really the best you have to support independence?
7387 2018-10-02 10:16:13 Yet oil hasn’t gotten the message that most of the marginal demand comes from em

7425 2018-10-02 10:09:25 To be 100% correct it was 3000 bpde (barrels p/day equivalent) it was 3000 barrels it was a "slice of execution time" then averaged up to a daily equivalent - note I also sais bpde (no O for Oil) that's because between 6 & 22% of the extracted fluid was Water - still good though

7462 2018-10-02 10:03:14 We "protect" them by killing them and stealing their oil?! Who gives a flying fuck about oil anyway when there is blood running in the streets? Only horrible stupid little trolls who love money more than people, that's who. With embarrassingly tiny hands btw.

7471 2018-10-02 10:01:52 oil nut? Don't you mean kernel?
7472 2018-10-02 10:01:52 Brent crude trades above $85 a barrel ahead of a November deadline for oil buyers to comply with U.S. sanctions on Iran.
7473 2018-10-02 10:01:32 The last time oil prices were this high was mostly due to external factors. Unlike now, high excise tax plus weak peso. All self inflicted.

Hedge…
7476 2018-10-02 10:00:50 Don’t bother, they can’t even check the oil price in the international markets and that it went from 40usd barrel to 80usd in 1 year ... can’t fight with ignorants, you can only try educate them.
7477 2018-10-02 10:00:45 When people go to Sponsorships and Events. This means that these abominable acts were not only forbidden to the oil.
7478 2018-10-02 10:00:41 2. So yes, it is authentic olive oil ie not cut with cheaper soy or canola. But, it is not good enough oil to be classified as Extra Virgin

7482 2018-10-02 10:00:13 Can you then please explain why the oil price in '08 was $145 a barrel, and yet only R9/L for fuel? The oil price today is a mere $80 yet we paying R16/L. Who is responsible for the levy increases? Who is responsible for the Rand HALVING in value?

Ford was selling engines and chasis to the 3rd Reich, Standard Oil was selling fuel additives to the Luftwaffe, heck even Coca Cola pioneered Fanta in Nazi Germany! It's all about the money!

We import all our refined oil and petrol.
7499 2018-10-02 09:56:47 Hahaha! Sure, Trump has also been complaining about these oil increases, so with its also coupled by the weaker rand.

7504 2018-10-02 09:56:09 Can we leave OPEC out of this for a moment, I’m not blaming them, I’m just stating that the price of oil is set by a cartel/s. To be honest, I have no faith in President Ramaphosa either, I don’t see him cleaning up corruption, and suspect that he has his own skeletons.

7507 2018-10-02 09:54:40 It's not government increasing the fuel price, South Africa is part of the world, if oil prices increase globally then we are not spared. You need to keep abreast with what is happening globally, knowing that it has a knock on effect on us as well.

7517 2018-10-02 09:52:43 The pace at which global oil prices are climbing means that the effect of reducing VAT on fuel from 16pct to 8pct risks being wiped out in a month. It also means that this was the worst time in four years to impose the tax.

7536 2018-10-02 09:48:57 No longer see any of this as any sort of remembrance. It's a celebration of the war dead & to think of the soldiers to be killed in wars today. 

Wars in which we invade countries for oil. Creating terrorism to justify the invasions.

Sorry, but that’s akin to selling snake oil. Yes, people fall for it. But sensible people on average don’t.
7806 2018-10-02 09:03:36 Everyone is exporting oil.  Both US and Russia is producing at the highest output.  If Iran is still exporting in a significant amount, there is not enough customers to soak up the supplies.  Note, China is slowing down.
7807 2018-10-02 09:03:08 We did say Gov was under pressure to raise money for bad deals they made I.e IPPs, E tolls, Oil Reseves sold etc... only stuff up is that are killing the poor in doing so... pushing people to the limit...

7957 2018-10-02 08:36:58 Ok I'll say it then. For the SDF, securing the oil fields took priority over defeating IS. Also, why would they remove the excuse for US involvement by actually defeating IS. But now you don't need that excuse, as Bolton has made clear the US will stay even after IS is defeated.

7998 2018-10-02 08:28:33 sir, import of vegetable oil should not be used in feed production, it will reduce the import and sabe 1 billion dollor for one year. 03004896052

8000 2018-10-02 08:28:32 The paper says stopping migration, but yeah … oil.
8001 2018-10-02 08:28:31 Many of your cheese products seem to often contain more oil than dairy.

This doesn’t sound very healthy.
8002 2018-10-02 08:28:16 It seems almost like a crisis of trust.  I suspect most energy investors see the coming E&P car crash, but have struggled after being burnt in the past to know who they can trust. Best thing the oil and gas industry can do is avoid hyperbole as prices rise. Then trust may return.
8003 2018-10-02 08:27:56 Think of the oil royalties that have flowed to Westminster since then .
8004 2018-10-02 08:27:53 Makes sense. Risk on is good for oil and bearish bonds.
8005 2018-10-02 08:27:47 it should just wash out mate, wash by itself, you could rub washing up liquid into it first as that breaks down oil (20 years hgv its happened a few times)

8011 2018-10-02 08:26:49 Men are actually better at taking care of their cars , men would check their oil, water and tires before driving out in the morning.

8016 2018-10-02 08:26:13 oil producers are never allowed to develop and diversify their economies, because they then risk becoming more independent and net consumers of oil rather than vassal states selling it cheaply to the developed world

8027 2018-10-02 08:24:35 That was the reason for why Sasol was formed. Now it’s a cash cow for the Cabal. Best of it all, they use coal that’s not fit for burning. It costs them C’s to produce a liter but sell it same price as Arab oil. Just another way we get stolen blind.

8032 2018-10-02 08:24:06 Oil market has become a financialised bubble manipulated by rent-seeking producers. I think the buy-side, led by China will shortly contest sell-side dominance. Having said that the underlying trend is up due to secular decline in EROEI.

8126 2018-10-02 08:09:17 Sure, the other way to look at it for Shell is they have a large portfolio with a lot of LNG linked to 14%-15% slopes, which would mean oil in Tokyo would need to be above $60 to break even. That's happened in 12 of the past 43 months.

8134 2018-10-02 08:08:17 Well, not anymore anyway.
Didn’t we close down most of our refining capacity in a decision by US oil companies to import product from Singapore?

8138 2018-10-02 08:08:08 Trouble is, plastic was seen as a way to solve the burning off of gas at the top of oil fields. Stop using plastic , which we must btw, and we head back to burning gas...remember Fawley Flame?

8143 2018-10-02 08:07:05 As long as farmers keep voting for the Nats who only represent mining and oil companies which are the cause of the farmers distress, they will just have to lay in the beds of their making.  One day they will wake up and vote them out then they can make a fresh start.

8148 2018-10-02 08:06:21 Truth be told without any sentiments, Buhari is a failure & disappointment. I'm the most open minded person you can meet. I supported Buhari Prior to 2015 elections. But Buhari proved everybody around me right with his actions and made me a laughing stock.

8154 2018-10-02 08:05:38 The producer doesn't always benefit. A good example is mineral rich African countries that export and smuggle their minerals to enrich foreign nations. 
Murang'a county deserves to benefit from the water. 
Turkana county needs to benefit from the oil. #OurWaterIsOurOil
8155 2018-10-02 08:05:30 Thank you for bring a such high oil price!

8164 2018-10-02 08:03:46 Surely you can buy technology. That is what happens in the UAE who also depend on oil like us. Go and check well Sir, those UAE, China, Japan, US, EU controlled their population growth. The UAE live like kings and queens because they dont procreate recklessly.

8167 2018-10-02 08:03:38 #ExtractivesImpact There are delays in handling land related cases in the oil and mineral communities. There is need to expedite these cases. How about a special Court for these matters? @graUganda @AransMC1
8168 2018-10-02 08:03:36 According to AA the price we pay at the pump has very little to do with Oil Prices, and is more to do with the commodity price of refined fuel.
8169 2018-10-02 08:03:33 #UKOG #ANGS doesn’t matter what the sp is today or tomorrow both companies can place to fuck for all I care, the most important thing is that this country has a new oil frontier as big as the forties field in the North Sea. In time people will begin to realise this.

8173 2018-10-02 08:02:13 Trump-voters: TRUMP caused the incredible high gas-prices you have to pay nowadays because of cancelling the Iran-deal. The oil usually coming from the Iran is now blocked due to his sanctions and is missing world-wide! The rest of OPEC cannot produce so much more to fill thegap

8192 2018-10-02 07:59:56 Because I fell asleep super early last night, here I am at 3 AM CST looking at financial market data. One thing I find really interesting about the current rise in WTI oil prices is that it's happening with the backdrop of a strong dollar. That's unusual.
8193 2018-10-02 07:59:41 @narendramodi On this day why can't #India make it clear to the #US that if #crudeoil goes above $90 a barrel then they will have to buy oil from #Iran as #INR @ 73.50 will harm the #indianeconomy big time or else incr supplies #SwachhBharatDiwas  #OPEC #Petrol #FuelPriceHike #

8195 2018-10-02 07:59:33 The pathetic liar says that we subsidize their military and it’s time they pay us back? WHAT?? More than eighty years and the USA is syphoning oil revenues in the trillions from the Saudis on scrap metal & flimsy defense contracts & @realDonaldTrump is talking absolut nonsense
8196 2018-10-02 07:59:33 Fine sir....
8197 2018-10-02 07:59:16 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, oil in approaching $80 per barrel, there is simply no reason for this as we export millions of barrels per year.  It’s time to pull our oil off the open market once again.  The speculators are going to kill your economy.
8198 2018-10-02 07:59:02 Yea ! It’s a lot of different types of good oil but that’s the point ain’t it?! Enjoy your cooking !

8203 2018-10-02 07:58:30 Oil is a little higher after solid gains as Brent Crude nears $85 as WTI tops $75 - at four year highs - as the tight oil markets continue to send gas prices at the pump to the highest in four years

8211 2018-10-02 07:56:52 2/2 to answer your query: I was a water flood consultant for one of the bigger exploration/production companies working predominantly on existing reservoirs. So I have a little knowledge on how oil plays work in terms of commerciality etc: but you keep playing your game
8212 2018-10-02 07:56:50 Oil price towards $85. I just hope my people will start savings and not see it as a boom period to “share the money”.

8226 2018-10-02 07:54:59 I like hot dressing on salad (sauté cooked potatoes in garlic olive oil til golden and crunchy throw in cashews, blackberries, cooked prawns then juice lemon, pour the lot over your mixed salad) and I've also had got stew with salad. Yummy. Hot and cold, it's like ying and Yang
8227 2018-10-02 07:54:56 And maybe coconut oil which I use sometimes
8228 2018-10-02 07:54:42 Real estate, commercial fishing, oil rights. Plus we’re a beautiful people. I can just see Matt tweeting this with greasy fingers while he lie on the couch with a piece of fried chicken or pizza.

8230 2018-10-02 07:53:56 I have an unusual intolerance and I strongly disagree. Trying to find out if rapeseed oil is present isn't easy, if staff find a list, it will contain the usual suspects but rarely a full list. Buying even from artisans they won't know what's in the accompanying bread roll.

8236 2018-10-02 07:52:55 Oil Prices rose, with Brent crude holding above $85 and near four-year highs reached the previous day as markets prepare for tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran kick in next month
8237 2018-10-02 07:52:41 Why? Any country even nearby throwing in a larger effort to move from oil to electric, relative to country size?

Lie. Manufacturing capacity has reduced 28% from 2015 levels. We are dependent on foreign loans. Buhari has borrowed more than any other in our history

8400 2018-10-02 07:28:06 continuous foreign selling in E&P..........#Oil stocks at #PSX have not responded to intl price momentum upwards
8401 2018-10-02 07:27:56 It’s job talk time on Thursday! One of our members talks about what’s passionate to them! Thursdays talk is on Palm Oil! Promises to be a shocker for our other members #proudrotarian
8402 2018-10-02 07:27:50 If they need the money so much, they should have earn it themselves, im not about spending a huge amount of money on some paper with oil on it but telling ppl to give away their money for other ppl is pretty stupid
8403 2018-10-02 07:27:34 interesting and thinking taken on board..
8404 2018-10-02 07:27:21 However they didn’t do any responsible attitude. Just do brake oil  for free just their branch. But the branch is so far from our place, they make me angry. I’d like to know, how do you resolve this kind of problem in your country. I want to contack bmw head office in korea.
8405 2018-10-02 07:27:19 Its backed by nothing no gold anymore.. "the fed" cant be audited..
America literally STOLE gold from other countries it had invested with it in the 80s..
Why do you think you war for oil..
Without being the oil currency America is screwed.
In a nutshell worthless monopoly money.
8406 2018-10-02 07:27:09 Olive oil time!
8407 2018-10-02 07:26:47 They also fail to teach us about how the oil industry works. From seismic  to the end products produced from oil and how they are made at different temperatures. Nothing!
8408 2018-10-02 07:26:37 akala ko ba ayaw mo ng isang diktador na duterte? these were once decreed by marcos in the 70's; along with it was the oil stabilization fund NA NAKATULONG TALAGA PARA DI MAAPEKTUHAN ANG TAO PAG NAGTAAS ANG OIL PRICE SA MARKET...PERO INALIS ITO SA PANAHON NINA CORY AND FVR!
8409 2018-10-02 07:26:18 I heard they went through his garbage too & found his grocery receipt that had "Virgin Olive Oil, Cool Whip & a pink light bulb" and he'll be investigated for running a brothel now. (yes, Dem's this is sarcasm in case you missed it) #MAGA #VoteKavanaughNow
8410 2018-10-02 07:26:16 I would spend my £50 on plenty of cleaning supplies, artificial flowers with a floral refresher oil to keep them smelling nice and of course a few sweet treats to keep me going through all the hard graft! .. maybe I’ll even by my husband a bar of chocolate or two? Or maybe not!
8411 2018-10-02 07:26:07 At wt PRICE this oil will be purchased on CREDIT?
8412 2018-10-02 07:25:52 そう！
8413 2018-10-02 07:25:49 R-18垢です！！ｗ
8414 2018-10-02 07:25:27 I knew that
8415 2018-10-02 07:25:26 Alternative facts, water and oil do not mix
8416 2018-10-02 07:25:17 Even with the upsurge in oil price >$80? No surprises, we are simply witnessing a reoccurrence of Jul.-2014/Feb.-2015; the dropping of a similar amount pre-election period month-in month-out. The CBN governor needs to explain what is going on; despite huge borrowing this time.
8417 2018-10-02 07:25:16 agree, more of a punt. 
the counter-trend argument is a combo of NAFTA (done), RBA vs BoC futures and Oil vs Commodities. Ambiguity on the last is probably the trap
v. difficult to structure a spot trade, a 1% OTMF 3m call (38D), for example, would cost <1% (~6.4% vol)
8418 2018-10-02 07:25:10 Why is it that when they find crude oil in your house it belongs to federal government.But when they find Indian hemp in your house it belongs to you? Can someone explain to me please 
8419 2018-10-02 07:25:00 Right. Though I think that would be a net reduction in consumption of steel, rubber, oil, etc.
8420 2018-10-02 07:24:58 ดีเอ็มไปแล้วนะค่ะ

8422 2018-10-02 07:24:31 buhari is only political in his statement, he is only protecting the oil in the South eastern part of the country which they are benefiting from, do you think if this country is divided he will say that? What really matters to buhari is the Oil which is the basis of Nigeria Unity
8423 2018-10-02 07:24:28 I blame that Oliver bloke. He puts olive oil in mash potato.
8424 2018-10-02 07:24:25 Magkanu naman ang sweldo ng mga tao dyan sa mga bansang yan. They have better paying jobs so they care less about oil prices going high. We are in a third world country and every peso counts.
8425 2018-10-02 07:24:12 Its an instinctive play i normally do have a go as news usually causes a sell off I think this could explode hence the reason I did not bother instead I topped up and increased my holding.
8426 2018-10-02 07:23:45 Lokl! I wish I could. I look like an oil slick on the morning of day 4. Its not cute 
8427 2018-10-02 07:23:35 Axe oil
8428 2018-10-02 07:23:19 Ask yourself a question.

Why has the APC primaries in all major OIL PRODUCING states been inconclusive?

1. Rivers State ( Sen. M. Abe/ Mr. T. Cole)
2. Delta State ( Mr. G. Ogboru/Dr. P. Utomi)
3. Akes Ibom ( Mr. N. Ekere/Mr. Dan Abia)

I will answer the question later.
8429 2018-10-02 07:23:07 Scary evil dirty milk. But let’s fill my car with terrorist, dirty slave oil. Yummy!!!!!
8430 2018-10-02 07:23:02 #Kaijuka: Whereas Uganda has in the recent past been more in the news for its Oil deposits, what has been little reported about is its vast minerals potential, which is poised to blossom in the next 5-10 years. #MinConfUg18
8431 2018-10-02 07:23:00 What is your go to lazy meal? 

Mine would have to be spaghetti.

Rotini Pasta cooked in himalayan sea salt for flavor. (No oil in the water, cause we want the sauce too stick to the pasta)

Lean ground beef cooked with Garlic then mixed in with Alfredo and Pasta sauce
8432 2018-10-02 07:22:44 Past interventions of this nature end up being misused or mismanaged, without the intended purpose being met

Check power for example. Do you know how much we spent financing the GENCOs & DISCOs? 

Same with Oil & Gas in the acquisition of assets sold by IOCs? Most embezzled!!
8433 2018-10-02 07:22:40 Yeah i wish I had. Maybe later today..its like hitting the brave button..no one says when they trade, it is like a secret here. I will tell you when I hit that brave button.
8434 2018-10-02 07:22:11 All of the ME states (excl. Syria & Iran) are puppets or vassal states of the US (it has many military bases in them all), which seeks hegemony in the oil rich region. Hence the war to topple Assad & the sanctions against Iran (2nd highest oil reserves in ME). #BDS
8435 2018-10-02 07:21:51 Financed by filthy foreign oil if you hadn’t already noticed. Couple that with the ecological disaster that is Exxon and you have a reason to leave my timeline.

AND this is just a different kind of fuel to burn.... not ecological.
8436 2018-10-02 07:21:30 #RRE #JKX imho it's essential to let these kind of companies run as they rise whilst wind is at their backs. Remember making many multiples in companies years back when oil surged, key was letting cash flow through to accounts. #patience #investments
8437 2018-10-02 07:20:12 Incredible! Check out #Moringa Oil Versus #CBD Oil...which is better?

8449 2018-10-02 07:18:02 Will you get enough algae to replace all the oil in the world? I don't think so
8450 2018-10-02 07:17:53 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8451 2018-10-02 07:17:39 You can tell the changing of the seasons by the consistency of my coconut oil.
But, damn you, Southern California. Give me the proper October we deserve - solid coconut oil and all.
8452 2018-10-02 07:17:33 I neeeed my coconut oil.
8453 2018-10-02 07:17:07 Hello. We have a problem with bmw korea driving center in Youngjongdo. We did asked to relpace brake oil and engine oil. But they didn’t anything but they asked airport service charge. We wanted to save the time while we were traveling. They made a mistake all.
8454 2018-10-02 07:16:58 my rise has gone droopy though. But excellent news.
I should have traded some on the spike..did you ?
also..my legs still ache.
8455 2018-10-02 07:16:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
8456 2018-10-02 07:16:12 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8457 2018-10-02 07:16:11 i use coconut oil religiously
8458 2018-10-02 07:16:08 We will apparently be selling our oil and LNG to china once pipelines are completed..So would this section of the deal be a problem for us?
8459 2018-10-02 07:15:48 Ihedioha don't celebrate yet, get to work immediately. Pick a running mate with grassroot appeal from the Oil Producing Communities of Oguta and Ohaji-Egbema. Get into close door meeting with Samdaday...SEEWHY
8460 2018-10-02 07:15:45 With the speculation of price increases on petrol, diesel, heating oil and the usual suspects cigs, alcohol etc... I hope so. Raising fuel prices is a cynical tax on everybody and an unnecessary expense on small businesses. Maybe they should look at raising the vat rate on fuel.
8461 2018-10-02 07:15:36 To paraphrase a favorite quote from the great Gary Prevost: Writing is an auditory art. It is music, not an oil painting. It is the ringing, not the bell.  #writingtips
8462 2018-10-02 07:15:15 CBD alone doesn’t do anything for me either.  I bought Aurora’s CBD oil and took 0.75mL and felt nothing (20mg or so).  I’ll try higher amounts and see 
8463 2018-10-02 07:15:06 My condolences Shay on the loss of your partner Dymphna. Listened to your very powerful and eloquent piece. None of my business I know, but have you tried cbd oil? It is reported to be helpful. Take care x

8465 2018-10-02 07:14:59 So, the US sanctions  on Iran have lifted oil prices for the US and Saudi Arabian producers? Hmmm....
8466 2018-10-02 07:14:46 True...but demolishing the Iranian Oil Sales will: 1) Weaken the Wicked Mullahs in Charge of Iran and

2) Spur ENORMOUS Growth and Sales of of US Petroleum sales.

Then maybe...the (American Friendly) Iranian people can be freed.
8467 2018-10-02 07:14:45 Aunty today crude oil reach $ 80

8477 2018-10-02 07:13:11 @realDonaldTrump Kuwait stopped crude oil imports on US because of low price forgetting that Kuwait are Kuwait now thanks to America. Why then America defend Saudi Arabia and pay high oil price for Saudi oil when US oil are cheaper, create jobs and incomes on US budget?

8496 2018-10-02 07:10:11 U.S. oil prices hit their highest level since November 2014 on Tuesday and Brent crude was also near a four-year peak reached the previous day, with markets preparing for tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran kick in next month.

8499 2018-10-02 07:09:44 Plastics need to be stopped asap, for one thing they use about 25-30%of the world's annual oil production and the main reason is that it is like radioactive material takes for ever to break down and destroys life while it is breaking down. It needs to be phased asap
8500 2018-10-02 07:09:36 What would you have being without oil lol.

8509 2018-10-02 07:07:14 @narendramodi , @arunjaitley @dpradhanbjp @nitin_gadkari  - Mr. Powerhouses, what is the role of Oil Ministry? if it can't keep a check & control oil prices. Dismantle & Scrap it! Why my hard earned money "tax" is being spent on this ministry. What a waste of resources!!
8510 2018-10-02 07:07:11 Who funds you? Your govt takes money from Tobacco industry in more than one way, for example as tax and you comment irresponsibly while calling others toddlers? Your words doesn't show any sign of manners. Uf you believe un harm elimination stop using sugar and oil. Hypocrite.
8511 2018-10-02 07:06:57 what sort of information are you looking for? Have you seen how they took over Berbera and Bosaso ports?
If you want to know the oil and mineral rights grab just look at the front companies like Somoil and their British government investigation.
8512 2018-10-02 07:06:34 Exactly. We’re too wee and stupid to run a wee country. Plus there’s no oil again and GERS says we don’t make anything. I say we should just let the neighbours we don’t vote for run the country. Now that’s democracy. Stupid nats with their kilts.
8513 2018-10-02 07:06:20 U r celebrating a non event prices of fuel in SA rise and fall in relation to global trends in the prices of oil; it's like celebrating that Zim has the most graduates in SADC yet the very same graduates are vendors/unemployed-that's no reason to celebrate at all.

Oil in the ground value
Offshore 3$  a barrel.
Offshore 5$ a barrel  large basin

Onshore is a higher price per barrel because of cheaper costs.

Onshore 5$ a barrel
Onshore 7$ a barrel  wild horse large basin

If oil hits 90$ a barrel you can  1$ barrel to the above!!!!!!

Crude is in a perfect storm, not only is the price soaring, but the USD remains strong meaning it is especially expensive to non USD countries

8753 2018-10-02 06:27:41 so what,  most of the customers of oil are getting 7th pay commission salary  or equal higher salary.  Now you also taking new big fat salary so pay more, what's in it.  You want big salary and not to pay more!!  How's it?
8754 2018-10-02 06:27:29 Brent crude rises to a four-year high of US$85/bbl. Higher oil prices and a weaker rand will result in further fuel price hikes.

In some cases it costs nothing, just sign up
8761 2018-10-02 06:26:22 I'm a cynic because I've seen dozens of miracle food cures come & go for years. Graham crackers were a cure. Ground apricot pits, blue-green algae, organic almonds, acai berries, kale, blueberries, goji berries, coconut oil. Every few months, there's a new "miracle food"...

Inflation Skyrockets. Making it impossible to repay US fines.
US Courts will then seize Ven OIL in lieu of Fines Paid.

This is a cartel and the closure of local petrol production amplifies this - instead you blame Trump.

But no...making promises instead.
8784 2018-10-02 06:21:42 A sharp rise in crude oil prices is part of the decisive role of China's oil and gas giant Sinopec to halve the crude oil imports from Iran. Global markets have ruled that China, the world's largest oil consumer, would comply with US sanctions against Iran.

8811 2018-10-02 06:18:51 Tactical Detail was superb, 10/10 for that but wtf was that Oil Rig heist 1/10 #paskal
8812 2018-10-02 06:18:44 I think you are right. Waited with my cuppa tea. You best play some Flash and the Pan...get ready for those tankers.

8818 2018-10-02 06:17:57 #Malampaya: oil price is super HIGH. So what’s the update on alleged #MalampayaFundScam Has the govt retrieved the money? What’s the status of the case filed? Sana bawiin na agad ang pera ng bayan.
8819 2018-10-02 06:17:37 Such a cliche and a slur to suggest that scientists who dissent are paid to do so!  Oil spills, air pollution (not CO2), the effects of mining: yes, they can be a problem, so strict controls & technology is required. How do you think solar panels/wind turbines/batteries are made?

8823 2018-10-02 06:16:46 When I got my oil changed that shit was black ass shit
8824 2018-10-02 06:16:18 It’s not ‘jo public’ it’s manufactures. I hate all the over packaging of goods, hidden plastic beads, and even hidden chemicals and rubbish in stuff like palm oil and sulphates. Good honest food and all biodegradable packaging, i wish!

8832 2018-10-02 06:15:27 Remember when British CIA shot your democratically elected leader over oil? Remember jow US was instrumental in overthrowing the Shah. Why are yhey still trusted. Change must come from within Iran.

8836 2018-10-02 06:14:17 Are we Arabs in an oil-rich country that we can command the oil market prices to drop? Or are you just from the #PeanutGallery who takes each and every opportunity to try and tear down the President?
8837 2018-10-02 06:14:15 In every way possible.  In fighting Kwaruption,  providing infrastructure, Health,  No oil reforms in 3years, even in conducting free and fair elections, standard of living is high.  He's FAILED in everything.

8852 2018-10-02 06:10:54 .#RRE MCAP $100m (£4.90) is a tad lower than $111m cash balance as of today. Currently producing average 11k boepd (50% oil, 50% gas). Significant uplift will occur when market realisation occurs.  #undervalued

8858 2018-10-02 06:10:10 What can we do when the OPEC & GCC countries control the oil & Trump boycotted Iranian oil which kept most of the worlds oil prices low
8859 2018-10-02 06:09:57 南無阿弥陀仏…
8860 2018-10-02 06:09:42 We may ask who funded oil exploration and drilling?

8865 2018-10-02 06:09:05 Oil traded near a four-year high as a drop in exports from Iran added to concerns over a global supply crunch - Bloomberg.
8866 2018-10-02 06:08:58 You all are so predictable.
The FBI & Trump are oil & vinegar...

And there are plenty of people who want to see him fail.

That alone will give any favorable findings for Kavanaugh more weight.

I'm ready to accept any way this thing goes on Friday, are you?

8875 2018-10-02 06:06:54 Something else on oil: Global manufacturing PMI fell to 22-month low of 52.2 in September. Oil markets only focused on supply at this stage, but demand set to slow if current global factory output trends persist?

8878 2018-10-02 06:06:31 Go electric, cut oil use, increase taxes on petrol, cut coal use and build solar capacity. Just do it.
8879 2018-10-02 06:06:28 It’s the only oil free one that works well with my skin I appreciate it so much
8880 2018-10-02 06:06:24 Only oil tankers and it's a PROPOSED ban. Also the Laxwelams are taking the feds to court since they were not consulted and do not want an oil tanker ban.
Check out @CalvinHelin .
8881 2018-10-02 06:06:23 The big challenge for the government is fuel prise, they are trying to find alternative energy and they are moving in the direction. If government proceeds as per plan, the depending on crud oil will be reduced by 25 percent, that is the only way.

8885 2018-10-02 06:05:14 Baseline value in BTC is far more interesting! Imagine the impact that pricing oil in bitcoin would have on the Dollar.
8886 2018-10-02 06:04:07 I get you, but strike action will further dent the economy, causing the currency to further depreciate, causing petrol to be even more expensive.  Markets don't care about our feelings. This has a lot to do with rising oil prices, but also with the sale of our reserves....
8887 2018-10-02 06:04:06 Fossil fuel corruption of environmentalism is actually older than nuclear power: it started when Californian oil interests bankrolled the Sierra Club to fight against hydroelectric dams.
8888 2018-10-02 06:04:00 Trump endorsement of NOOPEC Bill unlike 2007 Bush veto,giving overriding priority to national interests over special interests sponsored shale oil led by USCC,Energy dept,is a right step to lead anti recessanery and anti economic inequality consumer demand. But how to enforce it?

8915 2018-10-02 05:56:32 Any government will face this problem as long as our country dependent on imported oil and natural gas. 

Unfortunately previous governments suffered due to this same oil inflation now this government too faces same and in future any new government too will face..

8964 2018-10-02 05:47:31 I agree, but an immediate pullout could also lead to nightmare scenarios, plus our economy is super tied to oil, and Saudi oil is needed to set prices. We could definitely do some things immediately, like stop our activities in Yemen.

9091 2018-10-02 05:25:21 What does it have to do with protesting in oil terminals? What is the connection here? If no protesting, then no protesting. Or because where you live or your family occupation, a “no” event suddenly becomes so? Like Genesis 1?

The reason we gave Turkana 15% of Oil revenues is because they have been marginalized for so long. Mind you that oil is very little.

9191 2018-10-02 05:08:23 Clearly the establishment feels most threatened by social justice organizers than the   neo-con con-jobbers because it’s those oil slicked corporate dollars that help fund the suppression of constitutional rights. A Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court would ensure various suppressions
9192 2018-10-02 05:08:10 Motor oil is good for something though. It’s critical for getting the longest service life from ur car’s engine: It lubricates the engine’s internal parts, minimizes wear, disperses heat, & helps prevent corrosion & sludge buildup. Nothing, on the other hand, will remain nothing

9362 2018-10-02 04:45:03 Link will monetize all the data that will be fed into smart contracts. Think about that. Smart contracts are useless without external data to trigger their execution. Data is the new oil of the fourth industrial revolution and LINK monetizes it for every smart contract platform

9434 2018-10-02 04:35:12 Oil Price Hike : 
1. Levy of Central Govt sharing with State, hence State levy should abolished to zero. 
2. State should CAP THE LEVY OF VAT-TAX WITHIN Rs 10 -  12 to relive Public immediately.

9451 2018-10-02 04:31:12 But keep in mind, a good portion of the solar and wind infrastructure is now owned and built by those same oil companies -- so insofar as they continue stirring the pot, they could well be playing both ends against the middle. They profit either way, and the fight enriches them.

9529 2018-10-02 04:20:26 I guess we have to admit fiscal deficit reduction was largely achieved because of oil. One area govt still deserves credit is on overall inflation which is still well behaved despite crude turning nasty.

9682 2018-10-02 03:59:26 I always go back and forth in my mind as to whether higher oil prices are a sign of inflation that should be cooled with higher rates or a fiscal constraint akin to an energy tax. I'm not an economist, but it seems to me one of the great economic paradoxes ripe for study.
9683 2018-10-02 03:59:13 I really have too question the intelligence of Albertans. Do some damn fact checking and behold these oil giants relying on environmental advocates is the future. KENNEY should stop shooting at the industry he pretends to support

9709 2018-10-02 03:55:13 Hi there @Onision. Actually research shows that CBD oil alone does not benefit those suffering from chronic pain, as much as a combination of THC and CBD together. The ratios are adjusted to reduce the symptoms, without the high, hence it being MMJ.

9734 2018-10-02 03:51:17 Agreed. Voting conservative in AB makes economic sense: investments, jobs, strong economy... Harper’s awful campain and “distraction” scandals last election made it easier for Lib/Ndp to win more seats... which turned out to be catastrophic. Oil and gas will major role in 2019.

9742 2018-10-02 03:50:04 I think you're seriously confused here regarding the toxic tangerine and moi.  Which does not surprise me now that you're calling in Batman. Or maybe it's just twitter space issues.  Oh maybe it's too much oil.

9784 2018-10-02 03:42:35 Khatri sahab oil economy is not comedy, it requires deep understanding of govt finances. U can make petrol cheaper by subsidy but then inflation will go out of hand due to fiscal deficit. We have seen it during UPA 2. Now let's decide Rs 100/lt petrol or Rs 100/ kg onion/ tomato?

9798 2018-10-02 03:41:05 The old adage, "ignorance is bliss", holds true for far too many Canadians, who simply do not grasp the idea that Canada is being robbed of up to $40.00 per barrel of oil. For one minute consider the hospitals and schools we have denied ourselves by allowing this outrage!

9918 2018-10-02 03:25:15 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
9919 2018-10-02 03:25:14 Baldness ....
Receding hairline...
Generally, hairloss comes with age so young brothers let you head rest, the oil and hair sprays is too much!!!
9920 2018-10-02 03:25:11 The funniest thing is reading shit like Scholarly Kitchen and their desperate attempts to astroturf publishers' unjustifiable positions. It has exactly the same stink of contempt that the tobacco, gun, and oil lobbies exhibit for science, good evidence, reality and decency.
9921 2018-10-02 03:25:04 No palm oil is good palm oil.
9922 2018-10-02 03:25:01 Their desperation is so sweet, I just might use it in my coffee for awhile
9923 2018-10-02 03:24:55 I use unflavored oil to put into my vape. I get a lot of pains in my knees and ankles and it helps with the pain tremendously! 
9924 2018-10-02 03:24:49 Just put some peppermint oil on my scalp. What a feeling!
9925 2018-10-02 03:24:46 Raw honey and lots of liquids/tea. If you have on guard essential oil that might help too. See you tomorrow!! 
9926 2018-10-02 03:24:28 American Liberal Imperialism is the spirit of the frontier extended across the globe, the third world is a new wild west to be developed as the railroad and oil magnates did the west of old. We are spiritual cowboys on a world historical scale.

9931 2018-10-02 03:23:41 Not unlike how in the last years of the USSR the KGB was actually funding seperatist nationists to justify their continued existence.

There is one other obvious reason: OIL

9936 2018-10-02 03:23:12 When whole world is battling because of US sanctions on Iran & not buying oil & gas from them, when supplies are low & demands are more, rates go up. Countrymen should be thankful that are being supplied & there is no shortage though government mulling alternatives.
9937 2018-10-02 03:23:04 It is a peppermint oil on the temples type of night.

9948 2018-10-02 03:21:24 GVN @MwangiWaIria: If counties like Turkana are benefiting from oil also Murang’a should benefit from water supplied to other counties. #OurWaterIsOurOil
9949 2018-10-02 03:21:21 Having spent significant time sunning and trying to swim in the gulf this summer I can tell you that the water quality is the worst in years-since oil disaster. I just thought Trump was skanking up the water from MaraLago
9950 2018-10-02 03:21:20 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

オリーブ栽培・オリーブ油発祥の地は
地中海沿岸です
9951 2018-10-02 03:21:12 Mine was climbing into a dumpster when I was 14 to stamp down the garbage to fit more inside of it for the grocery store.  And it was the store manager who told me to do so.

Then there was emptying nearly empty oil barrels into a bucket for several hours on min wage at 17.
9952 2018-10-02 03:21:08 I found out a better way to clean makeup brushes and beauty blenders 
Use olive oil and dish soap ! It works
9953 2018-10-02 03:21:05 baby oil works wonders 
9954 2018-10-02 03:21:03 GVN @MwangiWaIria 's argument is very simple: If we are paying the people of Turkana for their oil, why not pay the people of Murang'a for their water? #OurWaterIsOurOil
9955 2018-10-02 03:20:59 Thought you were talking about essential oil
9956 2018-10-02 03:20:50 Bro I miss the oil fields so much. Shits wack out here.

9959 2018-10-02 03:20:11 some new builds are going for over 500,000 here.  i shudder to think what will happen  when the oil goes bust and these people can't afford the mortgage.  having grown up in this area and having moved back after retirement to care for my parents...I know the boom can dwindle
9960 2018-10-02 03:20:09 I got mine from @thoughtcloudcbd  they have a vape and oil bundle
9961 2018-10-02 03:20:02 i remember the time aura stuck her hands in coconut oil and it looked like cum and i yelled
9962 2018-10-02 03:19:54 We need to do it a lot lot sooner than that. 
But, my fear of peak oil(from 30-40 years ago) and needing it done by 2050 or so is no longer critical.
9963 2018-10-02 03:19:49 *uses almost entire bottle of lavender essential oil in diffuser* ahh yes, this should cure all of my stress
9964 2018-10-02 03:19:34 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇

9969 2018-10-02 03:18:51 And I’m grateful 
But I’ll be happy when he loses his license for promoting falsehoods like a  oil man.
9970 2018-10-02 03:18:45 Ooh, what's the ingredients list (apart from coconut oil)?
9971 2018-10-02 03:18:36 Excited pako kasi nagluto si gwen ng hotcake, kaso used oil ginamit niya, ayon di naubos yung chocolate hotcake na lasang fried chicken spicy pa.
9972 2018-10-02 03:18:35 Yes, you are right, but the title was sensational: Kuwait stops exporting crude oil to US
9973 2018-10-02 03:18:35 I just applied my Oil of Olay so you know it’s a wrap...
9974 2018-10-02 03:18:35 If oil  reaches $100 what will you do Modi ji already people are burning from high petrol  prices
9975 2018-10-02 03:18:17 Iranian oil is blood oil. The money is being used to fund a civil war in Yemen. Seems like they learned something from Obama

9977 2018-10-02 03:18:04 If you like acids, CosRx AHA is great. Hada Labo makes a dirt cheap hyaluronic acid toner that I get online. And @holysnailsshop’s Shark Sauce* and El Dorado oil are game changers. 
*does not contain shark!

9982 2018-10-02 03:17:00 Today my chiro told me I have the worst sacral injury he’s ever seen. Me, with zero common sense, a broken tail bone, and a nearly broken sacrum took a shower with COCONUT OIL and NO BATH MAT. End of story I’m alive but use your brain people.
9983 2018-10-02 03:16:43 This cbd oil literally saved me from my week long migraine
9984 2018-10-02 03:16:39 Trader Joe’s lemon grass and jojoba body oil is the best fall body care product I’ve added to my collection.

9987 2018-10-02 03:16:21 We hired MH Painting to paint all of the trim in the house (not an easy gig) and they did an outstanding job.  Very detailed, expert work.  They sent a touch-up painter to finish the last 1%, and it was done 100%.  Six months later, the oil finish still looks beautiful.
9988 2018-10-02 03:16:13 The world's problems get worse when we stick with climbing use of petro oil and natural gas. The world recovers from sickness when we migrate to electric, solar, renewables and zero emission technologies. It's that simple.
9989 2018-10-02 03:16:10 I am working in oil and gas field bro. How current govt didn't pass the benefits. The points where UPA criticized by BJP, this govt didn't delivered. No more argument.

9992 2018-10-02 03:15:21 When ya man doesn’t want new shoes, new shirts nothing materialistic but wants a fruit rack, Olive oil bottles, spices & practically gets a boner when looking at cast iron pans. That’s adulting people 
9993 2018-10-02 03:15:21 @AlexDPatt : “I guess when morticians embalm a few people it just gets to be a routine and you don’t mind it as much.”  
My dad: “oh yeah, it’s about like changing the oil in your car.”                             
9994 2018-10-02 03:15:10 Company manpower supply for oil and gas..
9995 2018-10-02 03:15:06 This is mind boggling since prices of oil are still high. Only the prices of vegetables eased down so what gives? Anong reason for the respondents to be happy?
9996 2018-10-02 03:15:04 China is getting the squeeze, more will fall in line! Russia, is a whore! Mother Russia, will sell out! There is your Geopolitical risk! The US, is between blends of summer  and winter, pumps up the oil, new USCMA agreement! Secures a way moving forward for delivery! Somehow!
9997 2018-10-02 03:14:57 While I’m not defending his tweet, ousting Elon Musk could be part of a grand plan to sustain demand for oil driven cars in the trend of rising oil prices.
9998 2018-10-02 03:14:49 It was a weird time man lol niggas was really killing ourselves, better off drinking motor oil.

10001 2018-10-02 03:14:27 I remember 1984 when inflation reached 62% in september. when  oil gas prices were high. There was devaluation of the peso. Well, less than two years later, a dictator got removed. What should Tatay Digong do now? Be grateful for increasing prices?
10002 2018-10-02 03:14:12 @cbdoilinfo Welcome. Very interested in learning more about cannabis oil.
10003 2018-10-02 03:14:11 When people praise NDA1 government too much. they forget that Oil prices were fairly low during their tenure. That helped in bringing interest rates down.
