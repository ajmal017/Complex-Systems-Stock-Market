2 2018-09-29 23:52:28 Martha Stewart sold stocks with insider knowledge to avoid taking a loss on an investment. Had she admitted it she would only have had to forfeit the money she had saved, but she lied and tried to hide the evidence that she had acquired insider information and acted in it.

40 2018-09-29 23:29:25 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
41 2018-09-29 23:28:24 Enough with the macro bs, how about some cheap stocks? TxCom illiquid microcap 2xEBITDA 3xEBIT from France. Cash=Market cap. Looks like legit business and pays dividend, any of the French listeners know what's the story with this? I have small position.
42 2018-09-29 23:27:51 @AppleSupport your in-app search is really bad. I just searched for “Tesla” in Stocks and got nothing. I had to google it. (Same problems in the App Store). Can you license their tech perhaps??
43 2018-09-29 23:27:15 Pourquoi dis tu que les stocks vont être épuisés ?
44 2018-09-29 23:27:14 crypto determines my daily mood when I wake up 
#crypto #trading #stocks
$btc $trx $ocn $tel $ada
45 2018-09-29 23:25:16 Can you explain it? Google just returns results for gun stocks
46 2018-09-29 23:25:13 Or more accurately how do businesses prepare for something no one knows anything about with regards Impact, etc.
We are building up our stocks and trying to reduce outlays so if things go Pete tonge we have a little fat to live off, what else can we do?
'hope and prayers' ?
47 2018-09-29 23:23:52 Enfin dans tous les cas non je l'ai probablement pas vu que les stocks changent tous les 2-3 mois environ
48 2018-09-29 23:23:16 Étrange car normalement ils reçoivent les mêmes stocks.
49 2018-09-29 23:23:14 Shorts manipulate the market & cause most of the stock volatility. They should be sued, not Elon. Shorting stocks should be illegal across the board.
50 2018-09-29 23:21:55 It's funny how crypto people love Tesla and Weed stocks
51 2018-09-29 23:21:29 Doesn’t matter what it is. It will make Big Pharma a huge favor. Why? Do you have pharma stocks since you wish them so well?
52 2018-09-29 23:18:59 like i never seen so many people invested in other companies stocks like they are doing tesla. like who cares.
53 2018-09-29 23:18:25 The only markets in future will be crypto running in open-blockchains. Why. Because trust is everything in commerce. All markets running by third parties stocks etc, are just going to colapse, is a matter of time.
54 2018-09-29 23:16:55 Has he disclosed whether or not he is short $TSLA or has other conflicts of interest (e.g. long other automobile stocks)? If not, his word is worthless and it's comically hypocritical of this dude to criticise anyone else for being deceptive.

58 2018-09-29 23:13:20 Yep. It was the tweet about going public on 4/20 that did him in. The stocks rose, he sold some, make a profit and said "them's just jokes."  The SEC don't play that sh*t.

65 2018-09-29 23:10:16 Weed is going to be legal in Canada on the 19th, stocks for weed are going up fast
66 2018-09-29 23:09:17 DB chart shows flows (not stocks), so it is more accurate to say that foreigners aren't financing increased issuance just keeping what they have.
67 2018-09-29 23:09:07 Watching for technical indicators helps. I can try to give you any I see for any stock, to help decide, if you fairly actively manage your stocks.
68 2018-09-29 23:08:43 Ask your banker/broker what he knows about small- and midcap stocks.
Probably next to nothing
69 2018-09-29 23:08:09 .

Two stocks, big whup.

Major indices are setting records.

Lots of big talk.  Shorting, not so much.

70 2018-09-29 23:07:58 Hardly a issue? the game is not working probably. how is that a small problem compared to changing a few numbers on recoil for stocks? im talking about priorities. stop being so dense please.
71 2018-09-29 23:06:15 Why ??? Now shorts will be rekt and with the Q3 sales next week the stocks will go to 420 as he sad . He has 20% so he will make a few billion usd more . This tweet will becoke the most profitable tweet of all time
72 2018-09-29 23:05:47 The next time we politically & legally entertain that which has been decisively & deliberately engineered as a media show, I will sell everyone else's US corp stocks! Because leadership is dead and cannot be revived through investigation, logic, or reason.
73 2018-09-29 23:05:32 Right, because you can only have or profit from stocks that go up in value?
74 2018-09-29 23:04:40 Stocks are bad right now.

76 2018-09-29 23:04:04 I also think what downplays his tweet is the fact that $TSLA is one of the most shorted stocks on the market, meaning that his statement acted as a catalyst for much larger manipulators who have steadily done this throughout the company's history.

79 2018-09-29 23:03:17 That's good my dad used to trade options and got something like 150% returns because he would just sit home, watch the news, and watch the stocks volatility.
80 2018-09-29 23:03:04 Thank you for the follow as well! I trade option contract structures on stocks and ETFs like Verticals, Condors, Ratios etc.. I mainly tweet about politics as a distraction/break from my work trading on Think or Swim. Good to connect with you as well!

89 2018-09-29 22:57:10 It was not one tweet, it was the manipulation of the stock market. I think elon isn't a bad guy but he fucked up big time here, weathet he did it intentionaly in order to profit from Tesla stocks or just by impulse, he fucced up

95 2018-09-29 22:52:57 Really ?? 20 mil is harsh for elon?? Shorts will be rekt , they will announce the Q3 sales next week probably they will have around 70 k sales and the stocks go back to 420 again. Then make a calculation how much he will make out of his 20% shares
96 2018-09-29 22:52:53 Could we get information on which stocks were balanced please?
97 2018-09-29 22:52:10 Oh wow, I'm proud of you! I've wanted to invest in stocks myself but I've always been so scared.
98 2018-09-29 22:52:01 Yea I guess it can fuck up the people invested into it like stocks etc., so it’s a big deal I guess 
99 2018-09-29 22:51:50 I’m buying me some Wolves stocks ASAP.
100 2018-09-29 22:50:05 So shorts will be rekt , and tesla will announce the Q3 sales next week probably the numbers will be fine and thats the way the stocks go to 420

102 2018-09-29 22:48:23 I stay talking to my mom about stocks, and how badly I want to invest and learn, but the conversation stops there...
103 2018-09-29 22:46:38 He tweeted that he had funding to take it private at $420 a share and stocks soared. He didn't.
104 2018-09-29 22:46:15 Given the fact that the SEC and Musk have settled it now, I assume we'll see some upwards movements in the next days. 

In a sense I think some stocks are literally going to free fall, check out Adobe, Nvidia and all those tech stocks.
105 2018-09-29 22:46:03 if tesla stocks go up rn imma cry
106 2018-09-29 22:45:53 By the way it may shock you but all Democrats don't want to get rid of guns nor borders....we dont want bump stocks and military grade weapons on our streets and we are fine with securing the border...obama was nicknamed the deporter-in-chief!
107 2018-09-29 22:45:16 I bought a flat in one of Bogota's best restaurant areas with a rucksack full of cash I'd saved. Rented the spare room, zero monthly expenses, the future was bright!

116 2018-09-29 22:32:52 $nvda 320 possible before Oct 15th? #stocks #trading #options
117 2018-09-29 22:28:28 "Dark pools" have to be the most overhyped name ever. 

You'd think it's a secluded pool in a cave around which men in cloaks would gather to whisper bids and offers to the demonic entity within.

But no, it's just a server rack with a bunch of computers trading stocks.
118 2018-09-29 22:28:16 I hope you use the same logic w PEL if it breaks down. Don’t fall in love..

There are still plenty of stocks which have tons of strength and others which had beautiful results but have fallen. Track those..might boost the PF on any bounce. One theme I am looking at is Chemials.
119 2018-09-29 22:27:42 If he went private at 420 at 4:20 I would have to admire him. Then buy moar weed stocks.
120 2018-09-29 22:26:20 Artificially driving up the price of stocks and/or influencing people to buy/sell
121 2018-09-29 22:25:49 In my opinion there definately will be at least another big day or two or three who knows with these crazy weed stocks

But I am diversifying now, adding retail, consumer durables and bit of fmcg. So may he max 6 or 7 stocks am in for the long term. I was all in CAN Fin luckily exited at 520.

128 2018-09-29 22:20:56 @SenFeinstein had no intention of helping Dr. Ford. It is all about delay. Now FBI can investigate Dems involvement. Held letter over a month even spoke to Kav. Said nothing she did nothing. Shamefully weakening #MeToo movement
129 2018-09-29 22:20:37 This is a win for everyone except Musks ego.  The stocks going to skyrocket Monday with this news.

Tesla / shareholders keep the musk brand, but just got a lot less risky / less volatile.
130 2018-09-29 22:20:03 Infrastructure stocks could move soon as it’s about the only thing each side can likely agree on.

136 2018-09-29 22:17:06 Yes, short positions in stocks are not illegal. The only way to prevent stock shorting is to take a company private. My suggestion is the @Model3Owners  help the new Tesla chairman raise the money to take the company private.
137 2018-09-29 22:15:50 Yeh and Bitcoin will reach 100,000 and Cannibis stocks will reach a 1,000 ? We hear this crap everyday,do these CEO’s understand their credibility is shot when they make predictions that NEVER come true ?

141 2018-09-29 22:11:22 Perhaps. But people have been bearish for years. No recession for a year or two. Buy stocks.
142 2018-09-29 22:10:56 6 stocks only! 
Grab yours now. 
For dropping and shipping
143 2018-09-29 22:10:49 pretty sure he caused more than that by crashing the price of stocks when he said it. Resigning is unfair but the $20m is warranted imo
144 2018-09-29 22:10:17 exactly why we need new one and sell him to madrid whike his stocks high, still git caught out alot today
145 2018-09-29 22:09:33 I had a joke, but it seems in bad taste, so I'll not use it. 
Maybe I'll go invest in some Kleenex stocks, unless you're being imprecise in your speech and using it as a generic term. 
146 2018-09-29 22:09:29 هو الخفغقع او الخفنغنقع ....
147 2018-09-29 22:08:58 Yes things are tricky now. But yes PNB Housing is growing at an exceptional pace. I too have concentrated portfolio. Mainly 4 stocks. I am diversifying. Can fin is looking good technically, n PEL is at support. Which one to buy on Monday?  can fin OI addition, nothing in PEL.
148 2018-09-29 22:07:17 @elonmusk @Tesla Please take Tesla private!!
I will never sell my stocks...
149 2018-09-29 22:06:42 A solemn one year anniversary of the Las Vegas mass shooting. Remember how @realDonaldTrump told you regulating bump stocks would be so easy?
Are you surprised that nothing has changed? Not even using a bump stock to create a killing machine.
GOP? Anyone?

150 2018-09-29 22:06:17 @Wackyjacky @FrAngle67 @Ventury1 Good luck but I don’t invest in those kind of stocks!
151 2018-09-29 22:04:09 He got off easy!!! They should have let that fraud squirm!!!  If it was you or me manipulating stock prices we would have been locked up for years!!! #ElonMusk #musk #stocks #tsla #stockstowatch
152 2018-09-29 22:01:11 What was wrong with the stocks? Which ones?
153 2018-09-29 22:00:45 Rip stocks

155 2018-09-29 22:00:02 The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place. forex stocks crypto currency
156 2018-09-29 21:58:08 I’ve raced for 33 years & don’t need a lecture on who I’m talking about. I’m talking about the drivers who should be running street stocks.
157 2018-09-29 21:57:36 @elonmusk elated you get to stay as $TSLA CEO. love my awesome Model 3 and my $TSLA stocks and options that have made me $. Happy to see the shorts don’t get their way to have $TSLA lose you. Gonna be a lot of sad shorts on Monday!
158 2018-09-29 21:57:05 Admittedly $crypto attracts early adopters and speculators much more than stocks. But Market Cap in crypto is an even poorer measurement than it is for stocks. It’s far too easy to inflate.
159 2018-09-29 21:55:03 In other news, release more stocks!
160 2018-09-29 21:53:47 WR: 26 Modifieds, 34 Street Stocks, 25 Grit Series Crate Sportsman, 11 Mini Stocks, 16 FWD... 112 cars @WoodhullPR
161 2018-09-29 21:53:38 "Invested" in what you Moron?? Stocks or Bonds??? I hope you weren't trying for "investigated". If that's the case you should be in the Meat field, the way you butchered that word.... Also what are you implying with Graham dressed that way????? Tolerant Lefty........
162 2018-09-29 21:52:39 @todd_harrison In regards to TCNNF, I’m weary about investing in OTC pink sheet stocks. Is there a reason why they are not fully reporting? Maybe I missed something.
163 2018-09-29 21:52:05 Congress & senate are paid off by AIPAC & bribed with loads of money from big pharma which they own lots of stocks in. It is time to clean this sewer. Arrest all of them. All they care about is money. They don't work for the people, they work for Netanyahu, a war criminal.

166 2018-09-29 21:47:46 soooooo how will stocks react Monday?
this gets rid of a distraction when quarterly results are released..and EM can destress a bit... but more energy into bfr..
167 2018-09-29 21:45:46 Still not trusting of this market but with that said I am focused on stocks that are oversold as swing targets. When I talk about swing I am talking about Jun 2019-2020 and an eying some 2021 trades. Posted a super cool graph in the room that shows strong tailwinds starting soon!
168 2018-09-29 21:45:46 Sad thing is he probably knows more than many of the analysts making recommendations on stocks out there
169 2018-09-29 21:44:56 "Then a long time later it turns out that I should have just bought [stocks], and thereafter I should have just sat on them like a fat, stupid peasant.  A peasant, however, who is rich beyond his limited dreams of avarice."  -Scwhed (Where Are the Customers' Yachts?)  #timing
170 2018-09-29 21:41:25 The people of Pakistan  come from ethnic stocks such as DRAVIDIAN INDO-ARYAN. GREEK SCYTHIAN HUN ARAB MONGOL PERSIAN & of course AFGHAN
171 2018-09-29 21:40:41 Yes. Manipulating stocks carries similar punishments whether you're a wall street CEO or luxury car CEO. Big shocker.
172 2018-09-29 21:39:53 Way to get em! What did you accomplish again? Stifling innovation? Made people shorting good stocks happy? Hooray!!
173 2018-09-29 21:39:47 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
174 2018-09-29 21:39:02 Once @Bakkt launch and the @CBOE / SolidX / @vaneck_us Bitcoin ETC get's approved - will it cause the stock market to crash as a result of resources shifting from stocks to Cryptocurrency? #TimeWillTell
175 2018-09-29 21:38:17 Bump stocks don’t turn semi-autos into auto. And you can make one with some PCV pipe and a piece of wood.

But never mind, yeah they passed the law so now they’ll just all disappear.
176 2018-09-29 21:37:55 hahahaha twatter stocks going to go down like fuckbooks....
177 2018-09-29 21:36:52 i have 4 DKs going at it with 99 stocks on kongo jungle, place your bets
178 2018-09-29 21:35:19 Water cycle: Liquid, Solid (ice), and Vapour. Money is liquid (forex), Solid is people (stocks) as they are hard to get, Vapour is materialising stuff out of thin air (futures)
Yes I have them to work them to make a cycle by breaking the bad ones. Just gets mo’ n mo’ fluid 
179 2018-09-29 21:33:41 Who among you had heard of bump stocks before the LV shooting?

Who among you know the same effect can be had with a rubber band, a shoestring, or a belt loop?

None?

Hooray ignorance!!!!
180 2018-09-29 21:31:04 cant trade options due to daytime employment obligations so keep nibbling on chinese stocks.  got $tcehy on radar and keep adding to $bili

186 2018-09-29 21:24:11 And part of Vince selling those stocks back then could have very well helped the momentum of the rapid rise the last several months. He's doing pretty well for himself these days.

188 2018-09-29 21:23:09 How are the stocks doing on all the oil drilling in Colorado?????
189 2018-09-29 21:22:20 My worst advice in my younger years was to buy penny stocks but when they weren't promoting them I lost my investment. Pump and dumps

201 2018-09-29 21:10:36 This from @paulpilot website..."abusive, or advfn-style nutcases are not welcome....please be polite, and talk about stocks not people." Ah, the subtle whiff of hypocrisy.
202 2018-09-29 21:07:32 I bought so much at VS and it turns out I've went from a 34 C to a 30 C...No company stocks that size 
203 2018-09-29 21:06:39 Investing in stocks is probably the best thing ive ever done because once it starts gaining money you can take out the gains without touching the actual stock itself whenever you need money. Let it grow but also know you have it there if ever in need of an emergency.
204 2018-09-29 21:03:24 Again, the point was made in the program that it is possible US ending stocks could climb to 900 mb.

211 2018-09-29 20:56:35 Do they still have some stocks
212 2018-09-29 20:55:55 Lots of fantastic knowledge today from @SpartanTrading regarding exponential moving averages, simple moving averages, trading low float stocks, and so much else.

I highly recommend anyone looking at trading to check him out.  I really cannot recommend this enough.

236 2018-09-29 20:18:36 you can make more elsewhere for sure, but I'd argue not as consistently. I've got a mix of players who I expect regular income from, and those who will return a much bigger yield if they return. Cr7 & Messi are what I'd describe as blue chip stocks, pay a lot for steady income

281 2018-09-29 19:33:46 NB There’s a 15 % withholding tax on dividends from US equities held in a TFSA. And, unlike such dividends in a taxable account, they are not eligible for a tax credit. So, maybe US growth stocks in a TFSA, but beware of US dividend-paying stocks. Better to put them in a RRIF.

287 2018-09-29 19:26:30 They keep saying that leftist voters are energized this year.
By what?

Lowest unemployment ever
Strong military
Respecting the flag
Standing up to China
Embassy in Jerusalem
4.2% GDP
Higher stocks

By what??

Vote!
288 2018-09-29 19:25:56 With WTI/BRENT at multi year highs would be interesting TK know what micro cap sub £10m producers or very near term produces folk are looking at. 

Any market. 

Name them and give a short bullet point or two on the drivers.  

Small oil stocks don’t seem to have caught the move!

290 2018-09-29 19:24:13 My model does come into cash but on deeper cuts than the current one we are experiencing in markets. If it cannot find any stocks which meet its criteria of value & momentum then it will start moving to cash.

293 2018-09-29 19:22:45 if you think so, go with it - let every CEO of a public Co with a stake in the Company just tweet about I am considering funding secured and turn down any efforts a few weeks later - helps the transparency in the stock market - despite that - what other stocks do you like?
294 2018-09-29 19:21:17 I can't tell you how many times that stocks I have positions in reacted violently to Trump's tweets. Image a CEO Tweets about intending to buy a company or shut a company out of supplier line, causing the other stock to move, only to not follow through on it whatsoever. 1/2
295 2018-09-29 19:20:44 Time to look for sectors and stocks which have not been in news lately. Less uncertainty and greater hidden value there
296 2018-09-29 19:20:19 All the risky retailers have their heads into the pot stocks right now. But if they get alerted to a jump, they will be right back over here. I have been watching those fast movers. As soon as they are triggered the retailers just start piling on.

305 2018-09-29 19:08:46 Keep ringing the register on trading. Never forget the tides turn quickly. Add some buy and hold stocks, MU as an example, quality at super low price, that you can hold 3 or more years.
306 2018-09-29 19:07:32 Honestly, there’s not a lot of cash flow from the stocks I own… I don’t play blue chip stuff with high dividend/low risk/low growth, which is more what PBR investment is like. My friends from families with money tend to go for blue chip or RE stuff, though.
307 2018-09-29 19:07:13 Stocks are overpriced.
Housing is overpriced.
Your credit charges are low.
What happens when the prime jumps about 1.5%?
308 2018-09-29 19:05:46 In any case, Trump provided information that was false and that dropped the market. Lots of people lost a lot of money, more than buyers of #TSLA stocks on the day of Musk's tweet.

For the most part, w/the exception of stocks at present & that small group, Trump and Kav’s world doesn’t benefit us.

376 2018-09-29 18:10:19 Then you are wrong, dearie.

400 2018-09-29 17:42:57 Seems, those stocks most actively traded or highest volume of shares traded ( and at or near 52 week highs), should consider buying or at least investigate to buy. Easy liquidity, bid and ask price penny or two apart.
Avoid stocks where bid and ask price far apart..
401 2018-09-29 17:41:56 last week only i told to one trader keep away urself with such stocks like #Infibeam ... it can down 100 rs in a single day. And just next day 240 to 142... and now 225 to 55.. Now no meaning to say that as per chart support at around 40...but i feel now even 80-90 big target.

Done

416 2018-09-29 17:26:35 Ffs “successful trip to Asia”? no details on how/why stocks are up? This list is a joke. Do some real research and post real accomplishments.
417 2018-09-29 17:26:35 Sure, stocks are not cheap. Probably general US stock market returns in the next 5-10 years won’t be great. But what are the alternatives? Cash and bonds even less attractive. And at the individual stock level I see as many great opportunities as in the previous years.
418 2018-09-29 17:25:19 As of today the code is written to handle the peaking stocks, all these are scores < 25

420 2018-09-29 17:21:57 It’s been pleasant to watch how AI fund manager picks the stocks for this ETF. This is now best performing holding in my portfolio and with low volatility. It’s a pity that it’s not possible to buy it anymore in Finland due to regulatuon. Could it also be listed in Europe?

422 2018-09-29 17:19:46 Management which walks the talk for a long period of time is worth investing in. Own stocks. Attend concalls. See if they walk the talk. I think this is a simple, yet effective way of knowing mgmt.

449 2018-09-29 16:58:03 I wonder to what extent the outperformance of "vice" companies is driven by the outperformance of low volatility stocks over high volatility stocks.
450 2018-09-29 16:57:21 Despite classification of bump stocks as machine guns (illegal for civilians) they are STILL being sold by RW Arms who has NO FFL. Why no enforcement of bump stock restrictions?? Bump stocks used in #LasVegasShooting killing 58 and injuring 422. #rememberthevictims
451 2018-09-29 16:55:43 If this holds well, we can see many of the stocks correcting to bizarre level. Maruti, Bharti Airtel already on Mark to do so to name some.

469 2018-09-29 16:34:55 To little to late. They are all criminals inc  the govt for letting these stocks go so high when they knew they had nothing & they let them charge whatever they want & 3rd party insurers pay they whatever they want by robbing us & making us pay ridiculous premiums & deductibles
470 2018-09-29 16:34:54 I was mainly referring to penny stocks. 90% of twitter talk about these stocks.

474 2018-09-29 16:32:14 This is last chance to buy $TSLA at fire sale price. 

I own it in my retirement portfolio and only few stocks which I will never sell. Like $COST, $HD, $DVA, $BAC , $LMT .
475 2018-09-29 16:30:32 Same with weed, alcohol, fast food. Maybe parents could start parenting. And teaching capitalism and economics. Kids, buy stocks
476 2018-09-29 16:28:13 fair enough. the $TICKER parlance is often used to discuss stocks. but I would argue utility should equate to value to advertisers, but perhaps not at this (still) absurd valuation
477 2018-09-29 16:27:48 Hahahaha usually they'll prepare more stocks for main characters and I guess they did not expect SiZhui to be this popular as well ;w;;

480 2018-09-29 16:24:07 Have read AM and am now reading Quantitative Value..as part of a graduate paper on Mean Reversion & finding undervalued stocks...looking at correlation  and/or multicolinearity of some metrics to EV/EBIDTA, such as Tobin's Q, Piotrowski's Score, etc.

484 2018-09-29 16:20:15 Anyone else been buying weed stocks? Not smoking the weed... But buying the stocks?
485 2018-09-29 16:20:00 I surely agree to that but, my point is that the stocks would've be short based on different parameters, but the fall expected was way more exaggerated and couldn't be forecasted. If otherwise, would love to learn the method.
486 2018-09-29 16:18:56 Omg ㅠㅠ she must have brought very little stocks only sia
487 2018-09-29 16:17:50 Trump: "We got rid of the bump stocks."
FALSE. Almost a year after the Las Vegas massacre, bump stocks are still  legal and unregulated. Trump is claiming credit for something he didn't  do, and Congress refuses to act. 

The @realdonaldtrump LYING to #MAGA gullibles #MAGA2018
488 2018-09-29 16:17:29 I think quantitative approach can only work with a large number of stocks and certain amont of leverage because the preditive power of the known metrics are usually quite weak.
489 2018-09-29 16:16:12 $BZUN if China stocks get going again, keep your eye on this name.  Trading much better technically.  Closed back above 200ma.  50ma is a reasonable upside target.  Hoping to swing trade this name with a simple call option.
490 2018-09-29 16:15:12 Thats why invest in Pedigree Stocks
491 2018-09-29 16:14:32 In reply I see battery & the adult toy Mfg’s stocks soaring. Those women are going to need something that will put up with your attitude
492 2018-09-29 16:13:39 The TSY yield rise has been relatively gradual thus far but on an absolute basis stocks and income-producing real estate are starting to face increased yield competition from fixed income/cash.
493 2018-09-29 16:12:37 I'm sure they weren't obvious. The payoff will be well disguised in the form of stocks, property, vacations, retirement gig, offshore, whatever... But the rats always gets promised cheese

511 2018-09-29 15:59:54 Maximalism has a great many facts on its side. But let's analyze how BTC dom. is correlated to overall market cap. in bull/bear cycles. 

E.g. utility stocks were down less in 2008 compared to Pier 1. 

But BTC will co-exist with gold, USD, LTC, and so on for a very long time.

530 2018-09-29 15:40:55 You should look at your 401 k. Stocks are flying high. The Right To Try bill signed. Remains & hostages coming home. 4.2 GDP. 3.9 unemployment, lowest ever for blacks and Hispanics. Saved 11/2 trillion pulling out of the Paris Accord. Learn before spouting off.

534 2018-09-29 15:34:33 In fact, I’m not in love with everything the @DNC has done. And I’m not saying they’re perfect, but for you to simply chalk up the environmental issues to “they have stocks in it” is honestly silly. A quick google search will show you how many of the @GOP are attached to oil/coal
535 2018-09-29 15:32:16 ‘72 | Wow, Stocks loses the ball on the edge of City box gifting the striker a 1 on 1, Fletcher slows him down allowing time for Plume who does the plank on the line to stop the open net shot!!! Heroic defending #city #nsl
536 2018-09-29 15:31:03 dude no stocks are going up with these lol
537 2018-09-29 15:30:53 That's what I wanted to say...Buying according to nifty is not a good idea...
There are some stocks which are currently 700% percent above my buying price even after falling 30% from top..

Totally agree with what you said.
538 2018-09-29 15:30:47 This is why one of the reasons I don’t buy stocks. Companies and insiders go public to sell stock, to me? Nah. Buy my own companies stock thank you.
539 2018-09-29 15:30:34 Looking at over 100 years of data on the Dow going back to 1915 shows that stocks have had 1,252 highs, which equals an average of about 12 new highs annually. Assuming the average investor is invested for 40 years, equals almost 500 highs in a lifetime of #investing in #stocks.

560 2018-09-29 15:13:48 apple stocks rise by 20%.
561 2018-09-29 15:12:50 They invest in a dececentralised real world wide #Cryptocurrency they can even mine from their PC, and on top of that a #cybersecurity platform like the world have never seen before, if you fancy ICO ERC20 token company tokens you are better of investing in securities like stocks

563 2018-09-29 15:06:48 Also while most weed stocks are waiting for thier HC and  culturvation liscen East.v will already be making millions in rev . It's all about market share . We will soon see the real ones from the fake ones . After legalization all bets are off because the above will matter .
564 2018-09-29 15:06:36 First shot on target from us!!!! It’s Stocks who gets forward and shoots on the edge but straight at the keeper!!

Why not try out our Vodka Blue Raspberry Slushies! 

Or a cheeky Desperados only £2.50 (while stocks last)
571 2018-09-29 14:59:00 well, keeping large stocks requires storage facilities, staff, fucks up cash flow. A business has to do what is best for shareholders. If it's cheaper to build elsewhere, companies have to do that. They make economic decisions, not political decisions.
572 2018-09-29 14:58:17 People ask me why I like $east.v more than  most mmj compaines . Easy. While the canadain market is flooded with weed stocks and most will not even get thier HC liscen . East.v is already in 9000 retail stores which will just keep growing .
573 2018-09-29 14:57:57 I don't have onhand pa eh. If sure buyers, i can get stocks 
574 2018-09-29 14:57:08 Overall agree. But some caution required. Some service providers like nursing homes and aged care facilities risk social pushback due dodgy operators and patient abuse. Australia for example has called a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the sector. Stocks have plunged.
575 2018-09-29 14:55:55 I guess investing in drugs is the same as investing in stocks
576 2018-09-29 14:55:34 Stocks up means that company profits are up. Shareholders are making more money. Big tax cuts for companies. Good returns for investors. 

If you are not an investor, or rely on a paycheck. Not so good for you.
577 2018-09-29 14:53:32 That really sucks! I feel for you! You can invest your money in the marijuana stocks but you can go to jail for possessing it. It’s legal in like half the country. Texas needs to catch up!
578 2018-09-29 14:52:29 Especially for someone who had no information, who has done no research, and who has made no active steps to invest. 

After full BTC adoption, I think it’s  purchasing power could grow similar to today’s stocks, and investing will be rightly be for those with information.
579 2018-09-29 14:50:54 honestly though make sure they’re not penny stocks because it’s seen quite a bubble and just like the housing market, it can pop but for now make that $$$

607 2018-09-29 14:26:44 At least @galgitron is discussing intricacies of xRapid. People still HODL bitcoin and even worse, NYSE/Nasdaq stocks. imho susie (triggered!) needs to chill a bit, her tone/name-calling is so annoying, she could've debunked it in 5-7 minutes, the rest is a waste of time.
608 2018-09-29 14:26:27 Who asked you to mortgage your home and buy stocks??? Did #amit jeswani suggest that??? No. You invest your surplus , not take loans and buy stocks

613 2018-09-29 14:22:03 Either way I wish I would have bought in. I'd be selling on Monday if I had it, these stocks are so volatile

616 2018-09-29 14:19:45 yeah, there are some stocks that pay out monthly, and then others (like ours) that you only get money if you sell them.

theirs are basically you are awarded X amount each year, and after 2 years of them being given, you can sell or try waiting it out for a higher sell price

619 2018-09-29 14:14:38 If y'all was the majority,then Chick-fil-A would be outta business,dicks sporting goods stocks would be booming,Trump and republican would not be in office and America would be destory. But whatever helps you sleep at night kiddo.

634 2018-09-29 14:09:23 @ManUtd support the manager or let him go. The fans are suffering in this powerplay between woodward & mourinho. The stocks are high, woodward isnt worried. Mourinho will always find a club & start winning again, he isnt worried too. Why is this farce being let to happen ?
635 2018-09-29 14:08:42 In fact it’s a huge headache for most people who come across a little savings, to figure out how to safely store it while achieving a little growth. The default being a basket of stocks/mutual funds/bonds.
636 2018-09-29 14:07:20 Lots..... that's the best answer for me. Golf ball stocks would go through the roof if I went out on a course like that
637 2018-09-29 14:07:05 MSG & other shortcuts to flavour are popular in restaurants that need quickish service and may not have cooking skills to get flavour in other ways (slow cooked stocks, stronger flavoured ingredients, balances of seasoning etc). They shd watch @MasterchefAU for tips
638 2018-09-29 14:06:46 Unlike stocks, diversifying your investments in crypto does not significantly minimize risk. 

That being said, smart diversification can increase your chances of holding a coin that *massively* outperforms the rest of your portfolio.

watchtower be like, “i have one shoe”

WT: “no, i found one!”
642 2018-09-29 13:59:31 I’ll go a step further and say investing in the stock market is not something MOST people should necessarily do either. Your average investor has no particular reason they own the stocks they do. They own them because savings need to go *somewhere*.

651 2018-09-29 13:51:36 @69daytrader to keep myself from holding a stock too long... I build a watchlist where atleast 25% of the stocks can make a major move.
652 2018-09-29 13:50:31 When our measured 1 and 2 year slopes of $SPY EPS estimate trends are positive, we have NEVER had a sustained sell off in stocks (i.e. a 20% drop in the market) over the past 30 years. When the 1 and 2 yr slopes turn negative, and price keeps rising, look out.

657 2018-09-29 13:45:07 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you cant be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If youre going to worry about short-term volatility, youre just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

663 2018-09-29 13:43:03 Funny my moving average system also says that Nifty is hanging at the same point Bank Nifty did before the big fall, Monday is going to be a very important day, only concern is which sector will drive it down this time? IT stocks? But looks bullish on charts overall.
664 2018-09-29 13:43:02 Unfortunately so. The squad is full of decent players apart from centre half. Whilst tactically Jose sets them up its ultimately the players the execute it. None of them look arsed. They are just riding it out till he gets chopped. It’s bollocks but it’s modern day football..
665 2018-09-29 13:42:34 Aye a deficit of 2.4% in the Italian budget and their government bond yields spike above 3% and Italian stocks fall. Meanwhile in Edinburgh the SNP don’t see a deficit of c 9% as a problem!

669 2018-09-29 13:40:02 Yeh fair comment. In 2018 the manager Carry’s the responsibility
670 2018-09-29 13:38:59 Nahhh. My cannabis stocks piece last week, frex, was obviously opinion. I thought it was good and useful opinion and well worth my fee obvs but there's a clear difference between that sort of stock punditry and something like Lex
671 2018-09-29 13:38:31 Ive never been one to call for a managers head but I think the dressing room has gone. Player power will prevail and he will go. Not sure who gets the role but I’d take the football England played at the World Cup! 
I reckon Zidane gets it next though
672 2018-09-29 13:38:25 Actually, as a trend follower with high probability trade setups, I find futures trades in individual stocks less riskier. I usually stay in the trade only a day or two... I keep pecking at it like a Sparrow over the period of the trend
673 2018-09-29 13:37:55 September one of my best months ever at 11% gross. With no marijuana stocks and no shorts.
674 2018-09-29 13:37:54 I agree with that. I'm always looking for new ideas, I already did day trading and swing trading. Which I personally favor swing trading. But my main strategy is buy and hold quality stocks with lots of potential.

And yeah, options are not Investing

679 2018-09-29 13:35:14 they have to stock more merchandise of tata or tae's fans or other stuff  for that matter so you would think there was more left but actually it had more sales....it happened with Tata, stores ordered more stocks because it is a hit so people might think

727 2018-09-29 12:44:35 Yes..@AnyBodyCanFly ,  @r_laroia ,@Rajeshatripathi and this guy @liberatedsoul3 become heroes by discussing momentum stocks during 2016 and 2017...they lured and looted by suggesting stocks like #duconinfra..I hope nature should punish them

737 2018-09-29 12:37:12 You know many Republicans have stocks in oil and coal companies that push to relax regulations and skew information to make it seem like there’s less that should be done... Things go both ways. It isn’t just a liberal vs conservative thing. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue
738 2018-09-29 12:37:00 Let me get this straight, people create bad press and then short stock. Musk says he might go private. The articles say he should be sued and stocks go down, making them money. aren't they more responsible for the market manipulation than musk?
739 2018-09-29 12:36:09 For the record, I am not happy with the economy. The “bull” market is in tech stocks like apple and amazon. I have neither and have lost $$ this year. I lost my job in 2012 and have not found comparable employment. Just so you know, there is reason for dissatisfaction.

750 2018-09-29 12:24:31 We hope @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia will evaluate if the systematic focused pummellin of stocks is not happening with an intention to do tax loss farming. With LTCG gone, anti tax-loss farming provisions may be required in India. Please evaluate.
751 2018-09-29 12:24:07 Sandipji but the fact remains why is everyone silent when stocks are hammed 40-50-75% with a joint effort of sold media and operators? Why is @SEBI_India silent?

759 2018-09-29 12:10:47 Australias stocks removed a huge portion of semi autos. Aust and NZ have both implemented fit and proper checking. NZ has a much smaller proportion of semi autos. Less guns, more checks = less gun violence.
760 2018-09-29 12:10:34 Extreme pessimism will bring some quality stocks to attractive levels.
761 2018-09-29 12:08:28 Stocks were relatively flat in 2015 - 2016. Then Trump’s tax cut increased profits by ~25%, deregulation reduced compliance costs and tariffs could allow U.S. Corps to increase profits if they choose to, e.g. domestic steel could increase price by tariff %.

764 2018-09-29 12:06:32 Quite honestly the risk premium in the Kenyan stocks right now is not attractive, in exception of a few banking and insurance companies, the rest look terrible. That is assuming the portfolio is built with dividends in mind and not the appreciation of stocks values.

769 2018-09-29 11:59:46 Stocks that gap will rarely gap in one direction only.

777 2018-09-29 11:45:01 When the markets are rising and close to all time high, many say it's too late to invest now. When the markets are correcting fast and stocks are crashing, the same say it is risky to invest now. Arey bhai, kehna kya chahte ho? When exactly are you planning to invest!?
778 2018-09-29 11:41:53 1. We never know what would be the bottom of the current market

783 2018-09-29 11:39:21 I don’t know that answer. But I do think it was predictable. Every GOP Administration lowers taxes on wealthy and removes protective regulation. businesses bloom, stocks soars, and then it all falls apart.
Trump did it on steroids I HOPE we do NOT fall apart on steroids.
784 2018-09-29 11:37:41 At this time some cab drivers are bullish about stocks, especially MAGA supporters. So any "analysts" who issue bullish calls are competing with cab drivers, not with sound forecasters.
785 2018-09-29 11:35:59 Everyone can’t own Bajaj finance or Edel, mmfs, SRTF, Ujjivan, greenply, Asian granito, kingfa, jk tyre, inox leisure, IndoStar Capital, karurbk, yes bank, strides, these are good stocks and making three year lows
786 2018-09-29 11:35:01 Seen similar tricks before in stocks; "pending partnership with Amazon" = product listed on Amazon  . Website mockups getting walked back etc. I'm curious to see what they're gonna come up with on Monday
787 2018-09-29 11:33:42 If only bitcoin, stocks, and other instruments either read market history, or ran regression models, or fibo’s. The bottom is in.
788 2018-09-29 11:33:27 Give some tips on which stocks will rise. Don't worry i won't tell anyone else lol
789 2018-09-29 11:33:18 Not parasitizes, symbiotizes. 

What happens when stocks are underperforming during rising rates? We get the wealth effect (creditworthy borrowers to issue to, tax receipts, new house purchases, high-end spending) from those enriched in crypto. Likewise, crypto needs fiat.
790 2018-09-29 11:32:09 lol can rumours destroy stocks . Or can make them. Applause sir. Looks like ur one of the ones got hurt.

797 2018-09-29 11:29:15 And do you include a volatility filter (-> stocks with low volatility tends to earn greater risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks with high volatility)?

802 2018-09-29 11:22:13 after seeing the kind of engulfing on the monthly charts in both indices as well as stocks..do not expect the market to revert back very soon.. atleast next 2-3 months of downfall or slight downward consolidation to happen..

805 2018-09-29 11:20:31 ya thanks gov't and old people for ballooning our economy on stocks and fumbling the execution so hard that we dont make any actual money out of the potential. You know how much pot tourism ontario is snubbing by not having retail locations? Hot DAMN
806 2018-09-29 11:20:25 this batting line up is unbelievable.. lanning at 5, perry at 7! @SouthernStars have some serious batting stocks @7Cricket

808 2018-09-29 11:17:37 Andrew should be thankful that his team mates took another week off his suspension, as for feeling sorry for him you are a peanut McClure! Feeling sorry for him throwing a punch, no wonder your journalism stocks are crashing.
809 2018-09-29 11:15:11 all around the world every day tourists take pics in those things. tour guides usually fail to talk abt how they were used as instruments of torture n often paint being in the stocks in a humorous light. many of these places have the stocks there AS a photo prop.

812 2018-09-29 11:10:03 What caused this man to get into this situation? The stocks of Tesla will suffer greatly and as always it's the small investors that will lose more.
Greed is a disease which seems to affect the most wealthy of men.
813 2018-09-29 11:07:31 And here was me all worried in case my stocks and shares fell!
814 2018-09-29 11:07:13 Sir , with due respect, there are many stocks that have never recovered after a 70% fall. The key is the quality of management.
815 2018-09-29 11:05:47 I'm just thinking how many bowls I need to wash and food stocks I'm going to reduce if I want to eat again....
816 2018-09-29 11:04:14 I expect whoever wrote up the talk advertisement just grabbed any pic of stained glass to hand. At least they didn't grab the Hockney as the example   In the mediaeval period Hockney would have been put in the village stocks and flogged for that design.
817 2018-09-29 11:03:38 Easier to do it at an index level, individual stocks would be scarier!

- You know that total stocks of firearms in Australia got back up to 1996 levels a couple of years ago and has kept rising, right?

Not much point discussing this with you if you’re not even in possession of basic data.

833 2018-09-29 10:44:29 it is very disheartening to know that but the reason of loss lies behind the mindset we possess.
Start reading.
You don't need to trade regularly or in all the stocks in the market.
Just choose your best 5-10.Make them your family. Find opportunities in them

836 2018-09-29 10:43:05 The number of investible companies is not increasing commensurate with the growth of the mutual fund industry.
So either the mutual funds keep buying the pedigree stocks at high valuations or buy these poorly managed companies with cooked books.
837 2018-09-29 10:42:19 Have better food storage facilities and planning for both private and public sector. In times of emergency such as drought, we will have enough food stocks.

844 2018-09-29 10:35:40 First investigation should happen against @CNBC_Awaaz few days back the suggested #infibeam in “kal ka khiladi aaj” media perfectly used by operators to dump stocks to retail. I still wonder why is @SEBI_India silent on #infibeam
845 2018-09-29 10:33:48 @jack what about this! Your party is showing! I have seen your stocks are almost in free fall, I to will soon go to another platform because of Twitter mistreatment of conservatives! Get this fixed! Bring @ThomasWictor back!!
846 2018-09-29 10:33:37 Not this way where rumours are used to destroy stocks. Mostly retail tradrts suffer. Point is that investigation can clearly show any concentrated coordinated action in the markets.
847 2018-09-29 10:32:37 J’vais te dévaliser tes stocks
848 2018-09-29 10:32:25 I like unions that want workers to benefit from the success they make those companies. BTW with automation companies are investing less in people & more in production so investors & stocks make gains. Small business drive this economy & communities as much if not more
849 2018-09-29 10:32:01 I'm sure I read somewhere that  $TSLA lose $4000 or something on every car they sell - and that's at really high Price Point. My concern is when Markets finally break it's dodgy Stocks like Enron unravelling that are  right near the Peaks.
850 2018-09-29 10:31:56 What happens when Bull Cartel takes the stocks to ultra high valuations? Tab kyu shant hote ho sir....didnt expect this from a person ur stature.....markets take their own course and stocks become over valued and undervalued in bull and bear mkts respectively.

855 2018-09-29 10:26:47 I too have straddle with me. I am not worried on the upper side movement since I do monthly addition in TCS, hdfcbank. Worried only when mine SIP stocks fall significantly like yes bank fall in a short duration.
856 2018-09-29 10:23:01 hmm so hsh isnt 사장 anymore but it doesnt mean he isnt 회장? I thought I saw somewhere that he was going to be the producer but since he has the biggest share in the company stocks I understand that he has the biggest power for decision making
857 2018-09-29 10:21:19 And does Data show that investor is worse of with 35 stocks or better off with 75 stocks. There will be good and bad examples of both & there will be temporal variations in performance of both too.
858 2018-09-29 10:20:03 Top 100 stocks account for 70-75% of mcap & Top 200 for ~85% of mcap. If you buy the market you can’t beat the market. 35 stocks is not concentration its known that beyond 20-25 there’s no added benefit of diversification & no of stocks is function of top down / bottom up also
859 2018-09-29 10:19:15 True. But how much you get in stocks?

863 2018-09-29 10:09:21 It remains a source of deep concern that @SheffCouncil have invested so much effort and so much of 'our' money in their attempts to both deny their vandalism of street tree stocks and to bully/crush widespread expertly informed opposition. #SaveSheffTrees @TiCLme @TheSadSquirrel
864 2018-09-29 10:08:50 I don’t look at the value of my portfolio but look at the prices of the stocks I hold and buy more when they correct. I have never bought my allocation in one go- buy in tranches as they say
SIPs and DIPs
865 2018-09-29 10:07:19 I think that's dead right. In the Real World Brexit will have minimal impact if a Deal gets done or an Orderly 'No Deal' with Transition Period. Sadly in the meantime Humans will fret and worry and this puts selling pressure on Stocks as buying pressure reduces.
866 2018-09-29 10:05:31 Why have grown ups, such as Deputy President, developed penchant at making themselves laughing stocks?!
This kind of leadership is dreadful to say the least.
No wonder these people drove us into the Goldenburg in 1990s.
Remember maize scandal during Coalition Govt.

873 2018-09-29 09:54:45 More hair splitting, since the referendum;

Business investment lower
UK stocks down

878 2018-09-29 09:47:41 Its all about calling it right on the right stocks so that when there is a downturn, the investments you do have are better placed to suffer the least, positioned for growing quickest and most when we come out of it. That said, other option is to go cash.

900 2018-09-29 09:15:18 Well. Because Currency and hard money are not the only financial assets that can and need to exist in a market. Some stocks, and local currencies will have utility and value. And an atomic swap exchange for that would be good.

925 2018-09-29 08:52:43 Way too much FUD around 1broker. Let’s keep it super simple:

They were shut down because you could purchase stocks.

Could the SEC or CFTC go after other exchanges for different reasons? It’s possible. But they don’t deal with stocks, so for now it isn’t worth worrying about.

936 2018-09-29 08:37:21 @dbsbank How do I buy NASDAQ: TSLA stocks using your platform?
937 2018-09-29 08:34:36 ILFS has short term liquidity issues & an over leveraged balance sheet.
Equity infusion & selling of some assets needed in due course
Market needed a trigger to fall & ILFS & NBFCs hv obliged. It's reversal to mean for many stocks that had run up disproportionate to earnings.
938 2018-09-29 08:33:34 I am a speculator using "TA" only.  The reason I use fundamental screening in stock is due to: TA works when everything remains constant.  A country's economy is fairly stable (FX), but a company's overall status may turn in a dime.  So I exclude stocks with potential landmine.
939 2018-09-29 08:33:08 I took a view on AMER, the news explained quiet simply why the SP wasnt moving even after a positive update 

The stock could still trade significantly higher however operational risk remains inside of the upside

The sector is hot and the stocks cheap in valuation terms

950 2018-09-29 08:18:08 That being said, it *is* zero-sum. Bitcoin can only go above $50T+ if other monetary and fin. instruments suffer. It will "absorb" wealth from other assets. I roughly think: 90%+ of fiat, 60%+ of metals, 10%+ of debt,  5%+ of real estate, 5%+ of stocks, etc. Fiat inflated latter
951 2018-09-29 08:15:36 If you are trading in stocks then the stock's individual parameters are very important. If you are trading in futures n options of index then analyzing trend correctly is very important.

And Bajaj finserv if reached to your target?
964 2018-09-29 08:02:43 Don’t try and predict a short market; or you’ll get screwed. Tlry can easily hold 150 with this hype.  Only buy and hold long shorting is stupid and gambling. 90% of stocks go up eventually

1033 2018-09-29 06:43:45 Someone must confront Asad about this. Fact is, when his firing was announced, people like me who were heavily invested in Engro stocks & bonds were very relieved. That very comfortably explains the rise in stock price, which actually did happen.
1034 2018-09-29 06:43:41 A fantastic night of theatre. Thanks for the special gift, Bob Stocks! Your heart is huge!
1035 2018-09-29 06:43:31 In a financial tsunami, 99 % of stocks go down, best studies fail,so time of entry is very important, better to wait for few months now,relax & enjoy FD returns.

1038 2018-09-29 06:41:11 The accredited investor rule wouldn’t and shouldn’t apply here. The problem is Crypto is incredibly volatile and can/does drop 80% in months. But if you make Crypto harder to buy than stocks then you might as well kiss Crypto goodbye

1040 2018-09-29 06:39:38 And the current composition of Nifty Smallcap 100 Index is so bad, I wouldn't want to buy even 10 of those stocks in that index. Right now its at 6150, and wouldn't be surprised if it goes back to around 4200 levels, from where the rise post demonetisation started
1041 2018-09-29 06:38:07 Yes. Actually people who don't understand that markets are volatile or the risks that your stocks might be worth 50% less tom should just stick with FDs. No use blaming brokers, analysts, advisors etc. because nobody controls markets!
1042 2018-09-29 06:36:32 +SECURITIES. You could buy stocks using crypto.
1043 2018-09-29 06:36:17 Should stocks under FNO be allowed to collapse like nine pins, without circuit filters?

1046 2018-09-29 06:27:38 General tendency is to go by the recommendations of stocks by so called experts on business channels, most of whom might not have demat account also.

1051 2018-09-29 06:21:25 Makes me think they are happy to keep onshore stocks falling in order to make them seem like a great overweight for foreign funds.
1052 2018-09-29 06:21:11 2/2 with 1 exception in my PF, no they haven't. 3 stocks on Friday alone went my way by >11% in 1 day.

1060 2018-09-29 06:14:15 I really still don't understand why people looking to buy Falling stocks *YesBank, DHFL, Infibeam.*

 Don't you understand these stocks are falling due to Heavy sell off from Big Fishes (FII/DII/HNI) of market. 

If they are selling it its clear that *something is bad in the…

1068 2018-09-29 06:05:37 It's discretionary. Weekly charts of these filtered stocks are analyzed for Volume Contraction Pattern and entry is made based on the daily chart when price crosses the pivot point as described in Mark Minervini books.

The exit is based on protective and trailing stop losses.

Added to Sep18 TTM EPS of 637
Will have at least 1200 crores on balance sheet.
Looks like People selling profitable HEG to buy looser NBFC stocks- a wrong strategy in fact should do opposite to recover some losses.
1071 2018-09-29 05:59:25 Hmm yeah most on my timeline are highlighting the already noted risks of NBFC/Financials investing. Here's the truth: you take the risk while stocks are going up...you can't get rid of them when they go down!
1072 2018-09-29 05:58:46 BTW bond markets look quite OK ..it is just that overvalued stocks are falling..to policy makers fall in overvalued stocks should not be much of a concern..

1098 2018-09-29 05:35:29 In my view :
Bonds (Long tenure ones) : For deflation
Gold : For debasement /devaluation of both local currency and USD
Real Estate : For Domestic money supply increase
Stocks : Depends . Can be inflation or Domestic GDP or Foreign nation GDP or mix of all.
1099 2018-09-29 05:33:28 why waste time over factors that are out of our control? 
Instead, why not pay more attention to things that are within our control?

1101 2018-09-29 05:28:13 This is a very well coordinated and orchestrated crash in stocks by people who want benefit from fear mongering. They will accumulate companies at the bottom.

1117 2018-09-29 05:06:25 Well please inform me when you get bullish again. The big problem today is nifty is down 6% stocks down 30-35%. Lets c how it goes but i believe broader market is now very attractive if one can bear the pain and sit through.
1118 2018-09-29 05:05:38 10% is the highest exposure I have to a single stock. Haha! A decent concentrated portfolio of 15-20 stocks I think is good enough.
1119 2018-09-29 05:05:24 Biased media prob works together with SEC. They gets illl gains for manipulating stocks.
1120 2018-09-29 05:04:13 With a 8-10% allocation per stock, even if one stocks goes to zero, its fine. 

It's the nature of the beast.
1121 2018-09-29 05:03:22 I’d pay for or subscribe to a Pro version with real-time stocks and options quotes.
1122 2018-09-29 05:01:06 It was just a technical trade.  I sold 80% right before earnings.  Earning's did well, so I'm just leaving the remainder alone until I get stopped out.  I watch stocks that have fat finger green reversal candles.
1123 2018-09-29 04:59:02 U.S. stocks ended virtually unchanged to cap the best quarterly advance in five years. The dollar edged higher.

1136 2018-09-29 04:46:04 I don't think sudden bounce back is possible, mid cap correction had started much earlier, market breadth was negative for a long period, politically there is uncertainty. However investors can start accumulating stocks as dividend yield is higher than bank interest

1168 2018-09-29 04:11:35 If you convinced about  particular sector exp. to grow at 15%-20% in next decade, don't invest all your money in 2-3 stocks,create a mini portfolio in your core portfolio.
For eg: In pharma, select few API's few branded generics, few research based, few large caps,few small caps.
1169 2018-09-29 04:09:57 So true.  Yet, its also fair to note that for every Apple/Amazon, there are hundreds of other forgotten stocks that ground themselves to dust after a 50% drawdown.
1170 2018-09-29 04:09:13 I'm newbie.Invested 1lac and pullback my all money with 36% gain to my saving account when nifty reached 11400. It's all about timely exit and not to keep invested all the time. Now same stocks that i invested is 20-30% Cheaper.
1171 2018-09-29 04:06:09 This month total 47 calls in Intraday for nifty 50 stocks.76 tgts 11 sl.74% success rate.All was Sell call.All identified at top.First week itself 7 sl came.If you  had Exited at first tgt only it would have been 2.35x.All calls are still available on mmb and can be verified
1172 2018-09-29 04:05:27 Dude, yeah the stocks doing well, but I’m just one guy! Wanna go halfsies?
1173 2018-09-29 04:05:12 These Market fall, just pulls down certain stocks to a larger extend without much reasons. Now I need not find reason buy the best one's at Good Valuation. 

But the question is what is Best Valuation ???

1178 2018-09-29 03:55:40 true sir, one question, now we can see stocks falling 40-50% or more frequently, was the same case before 2014? were they used to fall like today? of happen over the days?
1179 2018-09-29 03:54:21 great catch @SublimeTrades how do you find such stocks? SEC filings?

1183 2018-09-29 03:49:41 They speak about a thriving economy, but they fail to state who the economy is thriving for. Most middle class families don’t buy stocks. They buy groceries. Groceries are getting more expensive due to tariffs.
1184 2018-09-29 03:49:14 That’s the guy that told everybody he sold all his stocks because of the Presidential election isn’t it? If so, I wouldn’t trust him

1186 2018-09-29 03:45:48 We all know about how huge wealth creators like Berkshire, Amazon and Apple had more than 50% drawdowns multiple times. We somehow think our stocks would be immune to such falls. No stock has any divine protection to avoid these drawdowns.
1187 2018-09-29 03:44:07 Yeah then why are you giving me stock in Sept 28th?? Where's their stocks in Sept 17th? I even read jype give expensive prices to all twice albums and tickets unlike jype boy groups I wonder why lmao

Working in niche segment. Increased profitability.

Not well known and so no impact on share price during good amount of correction.

Disclaimer : This is in my watch list and no holding. Current price looks a bit stretched.

Since each tablet for oral use contains 300 mg of mifepristone,[13] Korlym should never be taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Taking Korlym during pregnancy will result in the loss of a pregnancy.[14]
1201 2018-09-29 03:31:14 I messaged them again, but it isn't looking too good for Facebook. Apparently both Mark Zuckerberg and his wife were both hit as well. Their stocks took a major hit today also.
1202 2018-09-29 03:30:22 It’s supposed to be hard for now, hold people in stocks at ath while they sell off an buy crypto at its lows then come out with all there bs ways to sell more than  21mil btc to rookies that leave crypto in “”custodian solutions””

1204 2018-09-29 03:29:34 Yea this is a deeper convo about business cycles, and the yield curve. A flattening curve and rising rates are part of the above. '95 saw a even flatter curve and eventual decimation, but first the market doubled with single stocks doing much much more.

1206 2018-09-29 03:27:22 Looks ok to me based on my risk perception.
Risk:
Bonds : Low
Gold : Low-medium (You worry about it's safety)
Real Estate : Medium (May or may not be able to get a real use of the asset depending on demand, area, laws)
Stocks : High (Business risk can impact cash flows)
1207 2018-09-29 03:26:59 Yeah and that's what made jype stocks rising so fast what did flop7 do? Lmao
1208 2018-09-29 03:25:24 Only reason they won.
1209 2018-09-29 03:24:26 Investors need to ask two questions to themselves:
1) Is my investment horizon long enough? (>3 years)
2) In this correction will you buy the same stocks which are in your portfolio?
If the answers for both are yes then you are safe.

1211 2018-09-29 03:23:12 Of what’s going on, not to mention it’s dvd distribution in other countries outside the uk that don’t even have bwba in dvd or streaming like they said for Netflix last year and their stocks are going downhill fast after toys r us closed, I’m not sure if they can recover easily.
1212 2018-09-29 03:22:57 Very strange india specific fall, rarely does a fall of this magnitude across so many stocks  happens in isoltaion
1213 2018-09-29 03:22:52 Good thing we're using Twitter. If fb wasn't so nosey asking for tons of personal info you wouldn't have to worry about breaches. Wonder if their stocks will tank again

1235 2018-09-29 02:57:39 Last point is a good one but with Commercials close to record long futures and Large Specs are record short, I think the 10Y can reach 3.50% max before stocks crumble and the Fed is forced to reverse policy and buy bonds again to lower yields. Time will tell.

1270 2018-09-29 02:28:47 Yes I agree! Adaptation usually comes with market assessment aswell as assessment on what trades YOU are good at! I’m no good at scalping or pip trading a stock like $SEA $SEA.ax in at 7.9c to sell at 8.1c. I want stocks that move! Every personality will suite a different system.

A lot of EM stocks have been in bear territory last few months, do you expect unimaginable drops or them to outperform EOY 
1290 2018-09-29 02:10:05 Lol so I found out I  have stocks now. I must lucky I know the company I work for isn’t known to pay its employees well but this makes up for it.

1294 2018-09-29 02:08:50 Rather than selling the savvy investors use this opportunity to accumulate quality blue chips in large & mid caps.
Probably the best returns one gets is from great stocks bought during a bad bear market.

1319 2018-09-29 01:41:54 In past there wr only 3 pure largecap funds, others had sizeable exposure to mid n smallcaps hence, alpha was better. They will struggle going forward. Overal MF has over 45% exposure 2 top 100 stocks. Imagine how well researched n crouded they have become to generate alpha.

1321 2018-09-29 01:40:47 Just like not all stock are "optionable", why would a CFD broker write contracts for all stocks?  Traders are never happy with there platforms for one reason or another.  They should be happy to have unlimited liquidity for low priced stock that are tradeable in TEFS.

1323 2018-09-29 01:39:04 The age of the phrase may be the reason that it is often linked with the practice of putting people into stocks as a punishment
The stocks were a means of punishment in use at the time the phrase was coined, by which people were tortured or ridiculed.
1324 2018-09-29 01:38:41 I know usually tradenet is good for high volume stocks but not lately for the best one. IB in my experience necer has shares of the best stocks.
1325 2018-09-29 01:34:58 Without belaboring the obvious, we need to be careful and keep flows and stocks, and debt and deficit clear.
1326 2018-09-29 01:34:17 Nifty next 50 is completely a largecap index. Its carved out from nifty 100 stocks.  @PassivefundsIn Am I right? The article says it is not.
1327 2018-09-29 01:33:38 Traders disappear from the market during a bearish trend while investors accumulate the stocks during the fall of the market
1328 2018-09-29 01:33:00 Just try to trade larger stocks it will help a lot! Small cap is the road to all evil
1329 2018-09-29 01:32:48 $CARG $VRTX $PLNT closed in the upper half of the weekly range on above average volume. Good sign for these stocks in this breakout week.

1332 2018-09-29 01:29:14 Here is the problem with your question: Which volume do we measure? Futures? SLV ETN? Flatware at pawn shops? For stocks, all of the trading takes place in one sphere: the exchange. But silver trades in many places. So if you are going to employ volume analysis, which do you use?
1333 2018-09-29 01:26:02 Umm...i wonder why should a professional fund manager even touch such a toxic stock even with gloves(hedge) on ? There are so many good stocks to choose from. 
And what was the objective in hedging as there is cost involved !

1337 2018-09-29 01:22:58 True but if you can afford to buy more stocks and options, then you can make more money. Does matter how well your portfolio preforms. 15% of $1,000 isn’t the same amount of money as 15% of $100,000... but you knew that.

1364 2018-09-29 00:59:21 Stocks are zero sum. The only difference between longs and shorts is that longs are patient. Shorts have been telling all sorts of lies about no demand and bankruptcy for the past 8 years. Why? To recruit greater fools so they can cover.

1368 2018-09-29 00:55:38 Yep, that's how it works. Shame and humiliation are among the most powerful mind-openers there are. To that extent, Twitter is very valuable. It's like the shaming stocks of Puritan times. No one would go through that more than once. That might be where "laughingstock" came from
1369 2018-09-29 00:55:32 Why am I in an uber with a fucking straight trump supporter & hes foreign.  Talking about trump is a good man because his stocks went up
1370 2018-09-29 00:54:42 Nothing trickles down! Massive tax give-aways went to the top and the rich love that and corps bought back their stocks.

1429 2018-09-30 23:43:17 Yes Thx POTUS! I have a good bit of tech stocks and I’m up over 25% in tech (average). With the deal with Canada done, expect even more growth.
1430 2018-09-30 23:41:29 Yeah. They don’t work so well with the bigger sport brakes that it seems nobody stocks pads for.

No thanks, I’ll just hit Amazon Prime so I don’t have to come back to this store. Ever.

1437 2018-09-30 23:33:28 @cryptoblood_ CB. I am very worried about October 2018. October is historically a very cruel month for the markets. Interest rate hikes, currencies collapsing all over the place, stock buy backs, Execs selling their companies stocks at 2008 levels, Lots of reasons to worry.
1438 2018-09-30 23:29:28 These Canadian cannabis stocks bouta go craaaazy come January 1st lol don’t sleep

1463 2018-09-30 23:26:48 Ban any ammo that is able to penetrate ballistic vests and ban large capacity magazines and any device like bump-stocks that can convert semis to fully-automatic. And register all guns so we can track down the guy who sells to criminals
1464 2018-09-30 23:26:08 Corporations that are doing nothing more than buying back stocks
1465 2018-09-30 23:23:31 I live in a 2000 SQ foot house on an acre of land and I work sheet metal. The only debt I have is what I owe on the house. Car paid for. Stocks going up. Just need a bigger gun safe. Stay poor my friend.
1466 2018-09-30 23:22:59 for those wondering..i have stopped using snapchat because whenever I open it the first thing I see is my grotesque egghead staring back @ me from the home screen and thats 2 much negativity 4 me. I know ur doing it just to spite me, mr. spiegel. this is why ur stocks are falling
1467 2018-09-30 23:22:34 But like anything when boasting is involved..stocks will take hits. And that's true as the day is 23 1/2hours long.
1468 2018-09-30 23:22:27 We dont need even 15% fall in US stocks before QE comes out.
1469 2018-09-30 23:22:22 He fixed nothing. Stocks are through the roof and unemployment is down. Tell me these are bad things....
1470 2018-09-30 23:19:57 The crap they teach you in high school LITERALLY APPLIES TO NOTHING YOU DO AD AN ADULT. property taxes? Credit scores? Stocks and bonds? Home ownership? Interest rates? Mental health?
1471 2018-09-30 23:19:15 Exactly, the main thing that you wanna remember in stocks, is that you ALWAYS buy low and sell high

But obviously, this is stocks we're talking about, so it isnt exactly a riskless venture
1472 2018-09-30 23:16:29 I once shod a quarterhorse in the midst of black metal stocks surrounded by live honey bee hives, I believe in you!
1473 2018-09-30 23:15:04 On the day the #BankingRC handed down its interim report bank stocks rallied and closed higher. It’s not the sector that’s vulnerable it’s the community and front line workers. #auspol
1474 2018-09-30 23:15:02 Those who can wait for such times will reap great benefits. like we should be patient in holding stocks , we should be patient in waiting for the right time to buy stocks
1475 2018-09-30 23:14:08 There is no bitterness that equals the feeling I get when the grocery store stocks the carrot chip shelf with shredded carrots
1476 2018-09-30 23:13:46 I can find some stocks but I dunno if they're gonna be big enough! But hey, I'll give it a shot.
1477 2018-09-30 23:13:45 Stop spreading rumors. I only throw away my stocks when my long big toe nail pokes a hole in them
1478 2018-09-30 23:13:42 Except with stocks you beat inflation rather than track it while having huge ongoing investment and recurring taxes! I’ve never had to put a new roof on any of my stocks. Plus they are completely liquid...and it cost $4.95 to trade versus 6% +
closing costs! Stocks > Houses! FTW!
1479 2018-09-30 23:13:17 I am more in the category of paying the bills, than buying stocks!
1480 2018-09-30 23:11:06 I already sold all my bank stocks that I can.
1481 2018-09-30 23:10:28 Good morning!

#AskMeHow
1482 2018-09-30 23:10:01 I bute myself every chance I get, but I know it's not ideal. I only lean though, so if you have some good sturdy stocks you're good! Maybe I nibble a little here and there >.>

1490 2018-09-30 23:02:52 It is incredible how over time how the value of so many cards have fallen, like stocks of companies that went bankrupt.
1491 2018-09-30 23:01:40 Let's see how many choose cannabis stocks. They read and watch biz media every day talking about them.
1492 2018-09-30 22:59:13 @Invest420 Have read some of your stuff online. Have been in canadian weed stocks for over a year. Would love to meet with you.

1493 2018-09-30 22:58:51 Yes, they're a scam when they benefit the wealthy and not the average American. FYI, The top 10% of households owns approx 85% of all stocks, so don't think the market helps most Americans.
1494 2018-09-30 22:57:48 After about two and a half years of not trading, while saving and finding peace of mind, I am ready to begin looking at stocks and keeping a focused mind.
1495 2018-09-30 22:55:59 Like stocks, income and wealth in general, land ownership is tightly concentrated among the upper class. #realestate #landownership #upperclass
1496 2018-09-30 22:52:53 I will pay THE GIANTS my savings, checking, 401k, stocks etc TO LET GO ELI NOW.
1497 2018-09-30 22:51:29 Australia enterprises are doing okay according news and publication reporting sources, but consumers can do better on investment savings, bonds securities, debentures, stocks, shares, warrants, etc, if you had monies where would you put some. people shall ask what's a debentures.
1498 2018-09-30 22:47:52 What are some good stocks to invest in 
1499 2018-09-30 22:47:17 the stocks and the harness did not help at all. Was their theme ‘s&m’? Then yes, bagay.

1502 2018-09-30 22:34:06 Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation I'm home... A great one. To me this is tangential to the stocks/bonds pairing. In a serious market crash I suspect btc to act as inflation hedge and most (all?) alts to dump to almost nothing since they amount to microcaps with no FA sunstance
1503 2018-09-30 22:31:40 signs your getting older. your early adopter gadget purchase now go to options trading with stocks. seems to have more rewards if i guess right ;) also. go @Square ; my future amazon stock long term. :)

1505 2018-09-30 22:27:29 We were still using the Browning Hi-Power from war stocks until fairly recently as the standard military sidearm...we only replaced the FN C1 A1 battle rifle, produced in the early 50’s, in the late 80’s...how long did it take to get new trucks?
1506 2018-09-30 22:26:08 Para kumpas y periodistas que hablan de inflación les digo, va a empezar a bajar, los negocios no remarcan, por el contrario, ponen ofertas con grandes descuentos, los importadores están disminuyendo  sus impresionantes márgenes xq con estas tasas no les conviene mantener stocks
1507 2018-09-30 22:22:14 Fact
1508 2018-09-30 22:19:12 Don't play the penny stocks.
1509 2018-09-30 22:18:11 Is it that you’re not catching as many fish or seeing as many fish? Either way it’s not necessarily an indication of poor fish stocks.
1510 2018-09-30 22:16:28 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your autism
1511 2018-09-30 22:15:38 Canada will come around.  Stocks will surge
1512 2018-09-30 22:15:33 You can buy stocks also!!
1513 2018-09-30 22:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1514 2018-09-30 22:11:05 From my own personal experience. 
The decline in fish stocks in our rivers the Teme and the Severn. 
There are not so many fish anymore and far less small and medium sized fish than there used to be.
1515 2018-09-30 22:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1516 2018-09-30 22:07:51 Yu can trade stocks for 2 and half years and lose all or majority of your funds ; However in your third year it all begins to make sense ( cents too )
1517 2018-09-30 22:07:28 $MNTA $IMMU are two high-conviction new buys of Peter Kolchinsky in Q2. We estimated his avg. purchase price per share is ~$21 for $MNTA and $20 for $IMMU. This means both stocks are currently traded within his buying range.

1519 2018-09-30 22:05:36 Just finished our quarterly "stock report" with @bethaje and @dbethancourt. Each boy picks 5 stocks at the start of the year and tracks their performance. They FaceTime to answer questions at the close of each quarter. 14 cousins all participate. Fun times!

1521 2018-09-30 22:02:28 Having big boobs is no fun, constant back ache, nowhere stocks your bra size, can’t wear braletts, look double your size, always in your way, get asked if their fake, get stared at, don’t stop growing. Someone take them off me!!!!
1522 2018-09-30 22:02:11 3/END/ Also consider 4 forms of stable coins: A StockCoin, CoinsCoin, Tether & Petro. We'll assume these 4 convert as follow:
StockCoin guarentees convertablility to basket of stocks,
CoinsCoin into crypto,
Tether into USD
Petro into oil.

How do you classify these 8?
1523 2018-09-30 22:01:12 I kinda want to do some investments in stocks but I have no money, no idea how or where to start, and I’m not old enough to invest.
1524 2018-09-30 22:00:57 Haha...the pitfalls of owning an aging Italian car. I'm sure AutoZone stocks them

1526 2018-09-30 21:58:50 I'm an advocate of educating yourself, and handling your own business vs padding someone else's wallet.  It's hard to go wrong w/a lot of the low cost ETFs out there, buying stocks/bonds is simple too.  Buy and let them sit, no different.

1534 2018-09-30 21:53:14 You have amazing stocks. 

But I suggest the price should be included for every pic you post
1535 2018-09-30 21:49:24 My dad and I have been talking about mortgages, stocks, and 401k for the past hour. Is this what adulthood is supposed to be?
1536 2018-09-30 21:47:54 I wanna learn more about stocks and shares. Sounds like a good hobby lol
1537 2018-09-30 21:47:54 気づいてしまったけどお昼のうちに大和家行くやつできるやん！！！！
1538 2018-09-30 21:47:26 Well a lot of things became good when Obama became President, my stocks went up after taking a dive in 2007. LGBQT people were able to get married. No one’s guns were taken away. You could say Merry Christmas everyday of the year, Hallelujah!
1539 2018-09-30 21:45:34 YOU MEAN IN THE 1700'S?

ROTFLMAO

What system did the Founding Fathers use to address Bump-Stocks, Automatic & Simi- Automatic Fire-Arms, the Internet, Cell Phones...?

There have been a few Laws, Interpretations & Prescidents Written & Cited since then, or didn't you know that?
1540 2018-09-30 21:45:07 Shits in a huge bubble atm & that's scary. I'm avoiding tech stocks and even bonds like the plague atm. I'll wait for the correction. Don't bank on any game release causing a spike. GTA 5 was released 3 times and it's effect was minimal on take two until we entered this bubble
1541 2018-09-30 21:43:04 We'll watch how Kolchinsky deals $TGTX since it is a top 10 stocks of his.
1542 2018-09-30 21:42:51 I’m just holding stocks (sold half of my pos at $30). Vol’s very expensive as it can swing either direction pretty fast. I would sell OTM put if I wasn’t alrdy long
1543 2018-09-30 21:41:49 In fact, one of the first acts Trump/Sessions did was to reestablish the private prison contracts that Obama suspended. Stocks of those companies took off after the election. Private prison companies are being used to house immigrants, too.
1544 2018-09-30 21:41:41 Unless you have stocks or a 401k, now there's a golden retirement

1547 2018-09-30 21:39:49 GOP corporate tax cuts just drove a giant spike in stock buybacks, the insiders are cashing out their personal stocks, and this thing is gonna turn bigtime. Arguably stock buybacks should be illegal or limited to a trickle %%age

1550 2018-09-30 21:35:20 That’s interesting. Neither have I. I’ve heard ads for trading platforms but not individual stocks. This is very likely a pump and dump. They’re going to try their best to drum up some capital and then they’re going to go bankrupt. Unless they get a hell of a lot of investments.
1551 2018-09-30 21:35:09 Win Nov canola up A$5.18/t & EU rape down A$2.50. C$ sharply lower against US$ & A$, supporting liftbin futures & then the A$ value. US soybn stocks higher than trade expected pressuring oilseed values.
1552 2018-09-30 21:34:50 I have friends over. 

We used to talk about girls, rap and sneakers.

Today we talked stocks with dividends, mole traps and circuit breakers.

1554 2018-09-30 21:32:27 song of my team and took 5 stocks and each stock is a different character is a cool idea
1555 2018-09-30 21:31:37 Win Nov canola up A$5.18/t & EU rape down A$2.50. C$ sharply lower against US$ & A$, supporting liftbin futures & then the A$ value. US soybn stocks higher than trade expected pressuring oilseed values.
1556 2018-09-30 21:31:21 What all do you track using your excel spreadsheets? Just curious cause I may start to do it myself. I used to do it just a tad with stocks.
1557 2018-09-30 21:31:05 I want to do something like this but I wouldn't even know where to start. Im not even sure what stocks are 
1558 2018-09-30 21:30:54 Board of directors. Depends how much ownership they have. Also, having Calpers buying stocks around gives them a lot of leverage.
1559 2018-09-30 21:30:45 All stocks bro no slicks
1560 2018-09-30 21:30:18 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
1561 2018-09-30 21:30:10 Actually again, if you did just a tiny bit of research you would know the wall I’d bring built and is up in some areas and continuing to be built. Then spend 10 mins to see that Obama’s said it’s not possible to see Gdp over 4. Stocks started increasing the moment trump was elect
1562 2018-09-30 21:29:07 When you invest in a mutual fund just imagine, you pitch in with a fund company to buy a spread of stocks. You own the amount that you put in.
1563 2018-09-30 21:29:05 This is the reason you don't pick stocks based on PE and DY.
1564 2018-09-30 21:28:33 It’s more like rookie street stocks on iracing tbh
1565 2018-09-30 21:28:16 A relatively simple way to lessen risk is to move out of stocks& into bonds & cash. But w/ interest rates on the rise, fixed-income securities are likely to fall in value. And w/ inflation creeping up, the lower returns on safer investments w/ fund even fewer years of retirement.
1566 2018-09-30 21:28:07 Heavily herbed, or spiced stocks, definitely. I learned to cook from the Doubleday's.
1567 2018-09-30 21:27:59 How’s it gonna look for the women when these companies’ stocks take a nosedive?
1568 2018-09-30 21:27:59 There are far more forces in the movement of a stock than a new launch, it's hard to say what Red Dead is going to do if anything.  All game stocks are way up over the lows of the 2008 crash, it's not clear how much more growth there is in them nor how far off til next correction
1569 2018-09-30 21:27:44 Every time Theresa May of the Brexit secretary suggest the possibility of a No Deal because THEY can't negotiate... the Pound and UK stocks take a hit.
Funny how their 'talking' brings the economy 'down'!
1570 2018-09-30 21:26:53 What are some good black and white film stocks?
1571 2018-09-30 21:26:10 Today in important imported chocolate news:

I believe it was @rosamund that I was telling about how @AndersonvilleWS stocks all the @ritter_sport flavors.

They don't, but I think they come close: today I counted twelve.
1572 2018-09-30 21:24:58 Consider that since 2009, returns on the S&P 500 index have averaged about % annually, vs. % over the past 90 years. After accounting for inflation, Morningstar is forecasting virtually no gains for U.S. stocks over the next decade.
1573 2018-09-30 21:23:10 57% of these people are laughing stocks
1574 2018-09-30 21:23:04 #macOSMojave brings new shiny Stocks app. I was trying to find any cool feature there, found none . 

The app gets data from Yahoo Finance, it could at least be able to sync your portfolio for stocks to follow. You can pick stock tickers like a monkey instead.
1575 2018-09-30 21:21:48 Stocks
1576 2018-09-30 21:21:11 That may be right (and I agree with the conclusion) but we all know that in the ever changing universe of stocks date is everything. Tons of stuff has happened in the meantime. For the better in this case. But as a general rule if something is old it ought to be mentioned imo.
1577 2018-09-30 21:19:12 @ScottforFlorida @FLGovScott Why should Canada create all the jobs for cannabis and wealth for individuals through cannabis stocks, DROP CANNABIS LAWSUIT or LOSE MY INTENDED GOP VOTE. PUBLICLY SUPPORT taking CANNABIS off of SCHEDULE 1,leave regulation to states, or I'm voting DEM
1578 2018-09-30 21:18:47 So it's not about qualifications it's about quotas.
Be sure to sell off your Cali based stocks.
1579 2018-09-30 21:18:41 True, but I’d argue the main risk is liquidity, which would affect bigger $ investors, mainly. I’d also argue there’s a ‘risk’ in buying overvalued equities. Negative catalysts would arguably cause the highest-valued stocks to sell off significantly more sharply.
1580 2018-09-30 21:17:49 I exited as many options I had in other stocks on Friday so that I could load up as much as possible on Tesla. I’m expecting to get a 20% return on my Friday purchases in a week or two, will lock in half of the earnings at $320.
1581 2018-09-30 21:17:03 Have the Dems made America the laughing stocks of the world?

Of course the have, but why would the rest of the world say anything when they would rather just continue taking advantage of the Dems that are in power?
1582 2018-09-30 21:16:49 I haven’t delved into dirt much . I’m running the fixed street stocks so I’m very rookie . Im about 20 pts away from 4000 I rating on paved oval I think so I basically concentrate around that . About 2000 on paved road .
1583 2018-09-30 21:15:57 Did you put slicks on your stocks or are you on all stocks bro?
1584 2018-09-30 21:15:32 Just catching up on @BBCCountryfile from tonight, great for it to be highlighting @homebrewhops from stocks farm and @thehopshed , Worcestershire's finest
1585 2018-09-30 21:12:20 you may be right but with that potential upside comes extra RISK that you don;t get with stocks like Fission and which you never mention in your frequent posts on this one.  I get it - not many shares outstanding - easy one to PUMP UP.  Carry on
1586 2018-09-30 21:11:00 Lastly I'm trying to get my hands on some defense stocks just cause war will never go away and they have done nothing but rise in value since last century.  After all that ground work is laid down I'm gonna try to figure out how to day trade cause that's where the real bags are.

1589 2018-09-30 21:08:04 Yeah I can get the chart on stocks but wanted to be able to add indicators and stuff?
1590 2018-09-30 21:07:35 If people are so busy making money in stocks and flipping houses, why are they selling courses too show you how they did it? We’re in the free Information Age, but you got former secretaries and cooks now masquerading as professors after a little success. 
1591 2018-09-30 21:07:26 That is so true. I have a Co-worker who said he didn’t care as long as his stocks grew. I wanted to kick him in the gonads.
1592 2018-09-30 21:07:21 He also said dont short stocks.  You do so at your own peril.  Much easier to make money going long (not $MDXG).  Take responsibility for YOUR decision to short.  Nobody forced you.
1593 2018-09-30 21:05:15 My stocks had minimal gains this week  
1594 2018-09-30 21:03:59 I knew I shoulda bought weed stocks instead
1595 2018-09-30 21:03:13 Haha...the @BillinghamTown are getting stocks in any day now.
1596 2018-09-30 21:01:58 Still no ban on bump stocks. President Fail.
1597 2018-09-30 20:55:56 Trump don’t need to watch SNL to know he has us as the laughing stock of the World!  The World Leaders confirmed what we already knew; we’re laughing stocks!  
1598 2018-09-30 20:55:10 and so it seems the final nail in the 'musk is an absolute idiot' coffin was his weed joke that screwed with the stocks being bad enough he resigned as tesla ceo. this is a weird year.

1602 2018-09-30 20:50:44 Overall, the families invest only 44% of their #wealth in stocks and bonds. There are a lot of private investments, in both companies and properties, which might in part explain why private-equity giant Blackstone sees its assets under management reaching $1 trillion by 2026.
1603 2018-09-30 20:48:58 @IWebTrading Hi, I am trying to open a stocks & shares account but I have only been living at my current UK address for 1 year and my previous address was in the USA. How do I enter this USA address? It complains if I put the ZIP in the postcode box. Thanks!

1607 2018-09-30 20:45:03 At least some abatement for the low Montreal bagel stocks in Kamloops!
1608 2018-09-30 20:44:15 TIPS would preserve capital but then you can't spend the money. Investing in stocks, debt, real estate etc allows the wealthy to live off their returns and still appreciate or preserve their original balance in real terms.
1609 2018-09-30 20:43:20 there's a guy in the trench disc saying his manager stocks @ 12 uk

he's allowed to get a disc then
1610 2018-09-30 20:43:09 Research on repurchasing of stocks by mutual funds shows that the probability of a stock being repurchased is on average around 17% higher if it was previously sold for a gain rather than for a loss: a beautiful example of memory bias in action!

1611 2018-09-30 20:43:01 I have told them that lots of people have been asking. As soon as the new stocks arrive, I will let you know brother
1612 2018-09-30 20:39:47 Non non, les stocks sont diminués everywhere. Plus de shrimps, plus de triple cheese, plus de sundae pie..... etc....
1613 2018-09-30 20:39:05 Fed raised rates and rates actually dropped all in the same week think about that. 25 pt already priced in party as usual. Watch, bonds (10yr) will not just stay at 3% but decrease and cash continue into stocks as usual. Fake. No true price discovery. Ride until Pop. Then SHORT!

1615 2018-09-30 20:35:58 The show has dropped over the years. As far as Trump my stocks keep making me money unlike Obummer. So as a kid this Kavanough guy may have or may not have done something? So the Dems try to ruin the mans life? If everyone here was a perfect teenager you are a liar.

1617 2018-09-30 20:33:54 Thankyou. I shall put Beth in the stocks we have outside for just such errors and will throw rotten fruit at her until she apologises.  I'll make sure its changed. Sorry about that guys! 
1618 2018-09-30 20:33:16 Women and relationships are like stocks...
On one hand you got exciting, explosive volatile penny stocks.
On the other hand you got slow steady growers like apple/ Facebook.
Volatility vs stability...
Which would you rather?

1623 2018-09-30 20:25:23 I get that growth stocks are valued differently, but 210?  They're going to dilute equity in a raise, they're negative EPS, strong competitors are entering with force (heard a radio ad for VW EV today), and there's more negs. If Sears had growth, would it have $210 price target?
1624 2018-09-30 20:21:59 Bonsoir :)
Pour le coup, les stocks eux sont bons :) Donc à confirmer demain au lancement complet, mais ça a l'air bien parti ^^

1625 2018-09-30 20:18:17 Any rally will be a great short opportunity in $TSLA , IMO. How many earnings have been negative? What product do they make? Rockets? Cars? Dumptrucks? Flamethrowers? Mars? A stocks value based on hopes & dreams sounds nice, but at the end of the day where are the profits?

I prefer to use it in making sauces, stocks, and gravy as the alcohol burns out, and that's about it.
1637 2018-09-30 20:06:44 1%??????!!!! Stocks move way more than 1% everyday!! Are you talking  about a certain stock? And ya this summer has been way slow!! But what you talking about 1% willis?! Haha
1638 2018-09-30 20:06:09 Behavorial Economics states that newer stocks tend to increase in value much faster than older stocks.

Primary reasons are:

- Mindset Shift (Older = Predetermined ATH, Newer = ATH is TBD)

- Prior resistance (bagholders/exit price)

- Novelty Fallacy (Newer is better)

1640 2018-09-30 20:02:05 I was told that, and then the person said stocks would start falling, their advisor told them to sell, I said so that’s Obama’s fault?  They said no, it’s Trumps. Democrats will say its Obama but if it declines its Trump. Egotistical Obama lol.
1641 2018-09-30 20:01:25 Gather some intel ;).  Well we got on topic of blockchain and use cases with fintech.  He opened up a bit and said that banks are definitely reviewing fintech (naaaaawwww) and that he camt invest in any stocks or digital assets like XRP.   He stated he had too much knowledge
1642 2018-09-30 20:01:20 I am offended you are still on Judicial committee with NO WOMEN. And your social media person should be whipped publicly in stocks with the alliteration “fecal festival.” #HatchUnhinged #hatchesSpoxridiculous #UtahFecalFestival
1643 2018-09-30 20:00:09 bring back the stocks. Seriously.
1644 2018-09-30 19:59:57 my thinking was that like stocks, under performance would hurt brand value, investor confidence, etc. to the point that in a way, each mistake devalued the individuals and team. Sounds like it has no impact on demand or value.
1645 2018-09-30 19:59:51 people not vaccinating their kids is the only good reason I have ever thought of for bringing back the stocks

1648 2018-09-30 19:56:50 That is how economies are & it was worldwide. Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000. Unemployment down from 10% to 4.7%. How is that not a recovery? Trump’s economy is based on DEBT, borrowing & is permanent. Obama’s recovery spending was TEMPORARY. Big difference.
1649 2018-09-30 19:56:38 If you trades stocks or options then you use every indicator you can set your eyes on, and you also have to realize that those numbers can also be manipulated by not counting people who have left the work force. It's simple math you can figure it out.
1650 2018-09-30 19:55:14 Oh my friend asked another question - When a guy says that everyone knows him, yet no one of substance knows him, is he still a big deal and the King of Stocks?
I’m sorry my friend is full of questions today.
1651 2018-09-30 19:54:56 Agree EM have bottomed out. Fed is tightening, but it's not severe & there is a lot cash still flowing around since corporations have record profits, unemployment is low, and stocks are at all time high. Once a FOMO cycle starts (#Bitcoin $10K?), then new #crypto  bull run.

1658 2018-09-30 19:51:28 A particularly self righteous and intolerant one too. I don't want an MRT along there either, but if I told them thats because I'd rather it be a proper road open to private cars they'd probably have me in the stocks.

1664 2018-09-30 19:45:28 Yes, the Senators are bipartisan re their entitlement to regal treatment, right to take frequent recesses, power to trade stocks based upon non-public information, access to taxpayer funds to pay-off their sexual misconduct victims and bipartisan against term limits.

1667 2018-09-30 19:41:56 This is my opinion and mine only, to let a Manager go in a club like Man U before Christmas is something huge, after all it's business with stocks and all, I guess they don't see us finish the season at 8-12 place with Jose #Spooky , obviously it's pure  situation...

1681 2018-09-30 19:23:44 Liam, cult stocks don't go down the tubes without a fight..the DNA of this company spells issues all over the place..no denying his visionary status, but as a good investment, i think not..competition is heating up,$TSLA's need for capital is growing & there are many questions
1682 2018-09-30 19:23:02 mura lang gud normal na tindera/tindero, mamalit sa gabii para pag buntag diretso na baligya then balik na pud sa palengke para mag refill sa ilang stocks haha. Antos nalang jud ta sa ani kaysa sa magpa lata na walay kwarta

1690 2018-09-30 19:12:26 hasn’t been enough volatility this weekend to make any money swing trading. ive started to notice how much the crypto market is following the stock market more, ie a decline in volume over weekends when stocks don’t trade.
1691 2018-09-30 19:11:54 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1692 2018-09-30 19:11:09 @HulkCapital this guy should be barred from trading another stock.... He burned all by $tsla stocks
1693 2018-09-30 19:08:23 Start with mutual funds then gradually move towards active (stocks) investing.  Always set aside these funds first, and then spend wherever u want
1694 2018-09-30 19:07:34 It's always the stocks that are neglected and no one looks at, they produce the highest alpha
1695 2018-09-30 19:06:17 Very similar to the US, where we have record levels of household debt (including 1.4 $trillion in student loans). We have asset price inflation (real estate, stocks etc)  & at same time debt deflation in real economy

1697 2018-09-30 19:06:15 @adidas stocks and sales will go down because of Kanye
1698 2018-09-30 19:05:53 Do you think it's worth to follow index pe. There are stocks like Hero which is down 25% from peak. The PE is high bcoz of TCS, hdfcs, SBI etc. Is it not better to sip in funds like QLTEF than index. They stick to value cum growth principle. I sip in it for 11y so may be biased.
1699 2018-09-30 19:05:30 Ethan is a nasnas who trades stocks on the weekends.
1700 2018-09-30 19:04:55 That is not a problem. We buy the stocks from our free market. If the share price rises and being poor minded you sell the stocks to make the profit then you realized that only 10% of America keep stocks even when share price rises. How on Earth is that Republicans fault??!!
1701 2018-09-30 19:04:30 You know what’s hard? Staying long stocks for months and months while the world is screaming crash on every dip. THAT’S HARD.
1702 2018-09-30 19:01:51 However, I could probably do more research and properly pull out just the top 5% and see how that looks.  But upper class was enough to make the stomach turn, the CEO #'s are even more grotesque when taking into consideration stocks and bonuses.

1705 2018-09-30 19:00:39 What's the best way to use ibd digital (recently joined) to come up with the top 3 ranked stocks to buy and more importantly the right time / entry to do so?
1706 2018-09-30 18:58:26 Haha knew what that was before I opened it.
1707 2018-09-30 18:57:42 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
1708 2018-09-30 18:57:41 So they both fried? Would think other one will still work without sli. Anyways quite a good timing, as in now to 2000 series (overpriced) cards are out and they are getting rid of 1000 series cards. 1080ti is the best buy even with new cards and I doubt stocks will last too long.

1713 2018-09-30 18:49:39 Just in case some of you didn’t read through what the #TCJA says which one of the biggest part is the Federal Corporate Tax rate which was at 35% and now it’s at 21%. Basically the top 3% got their taxes cut in half and all they did was buy back their stocks and laid off people.

1722 2018-09-30 18:43:34 Bump stocks are just talking points. They are not hurting anyone. There are laws to check backgrounds. But like the Florida School, they new about that guy. He had been reported. He was actually protected by some government programs.
1723 2018-09-30 18:42:30 Tbh he got off easy, and i totally lost 3k when the stocks dipped :(
1724 2018-09-30 18:42:09 Excelente artículo, todo parte de un mal uso de la teoría cuantitativa y no tener en cuenta los stocks de pasivos remunerados de corto plazo del central y el sistema bancario requieren altas tasas , sin esa limpieza previa ningún plan de estabilización tendrá éxito.
1725 2018-09-30 18:40:47 So dhodge, I guess your point is to keep on selling the the equipment, assault rifles, large clips and bump stocks, so that future generations will have these weapons at hand for more mass murders. I got it, not very smart or forward thinking on your part, but I got it.

1778 2018-09-30 17:55:24 You all need to do more to make sure that companies you directly benefit also have the burden of doing what they said they would do. CEO shouldn’t be allowed to sell stocks if the directly inflated them through buy backs. Their raise shouldn’t out pace average employees.

1784 2018-09-30 17:48:23 Never look at Index to invest in a stock. 
Only look at the stock and its prospect, whether it can compound 30% CAGR over next 10 years from your entry levels.
Still few stocks like AVTNPL is avail at good valuations. The stock had a big set back following Kerala floods.
1785 2018-09-30 17:47:56 This is odd but I chiefly recall the argument by the NRA afterwards in defence of bump stocks.

It was that by banning them you'd be denying poor people the feeling of firing an automatic weapon.

A company has $563,000 in the bank (I know lol so small) and they are losing $816,000 every quarter (90 days) 

With that cash burn how many days till the company runs out of money???

1788 2018-09-30 17:44:43 While not denying the publicly traded fact but at the end it made them huge money so as a company, as a business it was a very good decision. Still is. WWE is so much cash healthy. Stocks at all time high even after bleak ratings. So it made sense.

1912 2018-09-30 15:56:41 R is not rupees. It is Risk :Reward. For example, if your Risk per trade is 2% of 1 Lakh then R is 2% or 2000 rupees. So if you want to buy 500 stocks of X at 100 rupees, your stop loss will be at 96. That is 4 rupees stop loss. R is the risk% on your capital. Hope u understood

1924 2018-09-30 15:44:16 Yes I took partial loss on Tata Motors to reinvest in better quality stocks in auto sector available at reasonable valuations..
1925 2018-09-30 15:43:49 I guess he called me one of those dumb FuK because I voted for Trump now I’m cashing in with my stocks (401k) now and having a ball. Who in their right mind would give up this economy for some one that hates half the country?
1926 2018-09-30 15:43:46 "Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same."-Peter Lynch

1929 2018-09-30 15:43:04 What is the most dangerous phase in market characterized by - most of the liquid shares below 200 day EMA. That is how Indian stocks are as of now. Constantly trading below 200 day EMA and making new lows and in some cases panic. Something is rotten somewhere.
1930 2018-09-30 15:42:40 For me even for a whole year you have 20-30 different stocks but maybe 5-6 gives you the good performance in your portfolio .
1931 2018-09-30 15:42:31 Ooo seriously bhakt?
1932 2018-09-30 15:39:18 Panic over I can use my stocks and shares and property portfolio to tide me over
1933 2018-09-30 15:38:53 Changes 1. Not taking on more risk than can be tolerated. 2. Holding growth value long term with stop losses in place. 3. Diversification (I added income property, land rental) so I’m not locked in to stocks only. 4. Extensive research 5. Up to date investment news
1934 2018-09-30 15:38:34 It’s because he was gonna buy all Tesla stocks @ $420 which is more than the price of the current market with funding secured that means he has enough money flow for that....but that didn’t happen so this is considered manipulation. SEC job is to punish manipulators of stock etc

1936 2018-09-30 15:37:08 Took some risks this week and diversified our stock. Invested in new stocks such as Netflix, CVS, and Fox. We're still at an overall gain of .25%, but have been in the red for the last few days. Hoping things will turn around next week. #SUACCF18
1937 2018-09-30 15:37:00 Interested if others would opine. What is likely to be the catalyst/moment to stop stocks either going down or stationary
1938 2018-09-30 15:35:50 Ideally what one should do who holding recent momentum sector stocks, which are holding on to the breakout level and given-up all the recent gains but still just  trading above +2 to +5% levels. ,

1941 2018-09-30 15:33:54 it is true for the entire year. 5 to 10 stocks make up 80% or more of your performance.
1942 2018-09-30 15:33:00 This is something that influences my trading significantly.
Defining #trading rules for proven strategies is my edge.

1945 2018-09-30 15:29:21 I realize it sounds crazy but as a result of some of the strange thing that happened at Skinwalker Ranch i have had this new ability to create a trading algorithm that works as both a buy/sell/ and short indicator on all stocks.  Give me a few symbols to test!
1946 2018-09-30 15:27:05 I miss your commentary from the minyanville day’s... good to hear you chime in stocks!  I still got the boo and bear T-shirt lol .. keep at it Toddo!
1947 2018-09-30 15:25:42 Well how do you talk to these idiot's without getting a headache ? Their minds are so numb, to hear them talk makes my head hurt  ! Wonder if they have stocks in planed parenthood?
1948 2018-09-30 15:25:42 I think we should just delete all our accounts. See how that works for their stocks!
1949 2018-09-30 15:25:36 It’s like 9/11 - people anchor to when trump was elected.  “Before trump” and “after trump”.  This week,  someone said to me, “we hate trump,  so we sold off all our stocks when he was elected”.  It’s almost 2 years already,  move on!
1950 2018-09-30 15:24:08 I’ve been toying with getting in stocks for a while now, but was hesitant because of my finite knowledge of the market. I wake up this morning to a text from my friend (whom I’ve never mentioned stocks to) sharing a link to an app she’s using for novice traders. Okay @God 
1951 2018-09-30 15:23:13 I wondered why China stocks were up.
1952 2018-09-30 15:22:58 been saying this for a while now. It MUST be done outside Congress' purview. There will be no justice found in congress. They're corrupted and should all be dragged from their offices and thrown into stocks in a public square for public ridicule...

1955 2018-09-30 15:21:56 Let's continue with investment properties. My knowledge is not yet ready to play with stocks.
1956 2018-09-30 15:18:19 I am looking forward to liquidating my $UEC on Monday. Better places for my money considering how "all in" on #uranium stocks I am. Going into Appia or another REE play.
1957 2018-09-30 15:17:19 If nifty take support above 10870 May be seen bounce till resitance of 11170 and if able to cross resitance then 11350 in other hand if nifty not sustain above given level may be sell off again. But in many stocks which is already fell 50-70% avoid short you may be stuck.
1958 2018-09-30 15:16:45 When you say all the attractions you mean the stocks, Morris dancers and merry-go-round...

1962 2018-09-30 15:11:36 In life as in stocks everything is a risk and nothing is a straightline.
1963 2018-09-30 15:10:49 --:: Ima start back investing at the end of the year and not pull out this time. Also, play with stocks and bonds, start off small and slow.
1964 2018-09-30 15:10:31 So flipping bored of this cold and cough now. Just had to whizz to replenish my stocks of Strepsils, Lemsip and cough medicine as I've been through industrial quantities of them all in the last week....
1965 2018-09-30 15:09:55 I am always amazed at how ignorant people are about the stock market. The ONLY reason stocks rose under Obama was the low interest rates in a bad economy. Companies issued low interest bonds so they could buy back their stocks, which caused their stocks to increase in price

1968 2018-09-30 15:09:15 @OfficialAPCNg, @officialEFCC, @MBuhari and @NGRPresident are harrassing and intimidating Nigerians just to cover their #corruption.

1969 2018-09-30 15:08:24 If you are looking for investment then you have minimum 3-5 years time frame minimum. Because of many stocks may be go On consolidation mode.

1974 2018-09-30 15:04:47 Why all start investigations only when there is a fall in stock?Check the bulls and stocks will not fall 60%/70%.
1975 2018-09-30 15:03:51 35 years of trading and you can bitch slap me if you like, but trading is hard or everyone would be doing it.  Penny stocks are the worst as you have limited information and it’s the greater fool theory of someone paying more than you.  Good luck. You will need it.
1976 2018-09-30 15:03:47 I’ll say it again! If you picked a team room you’d pick Europe where it’s probably beers and cigars every day. We are probably sitting on our iphones checking stocks and playing penny poker.

1980 2018-09-30 15:00:54 @renegadestyle I am of the firm opinion based on EW that investment in gold ,silver and platinum stocks will be a great wealth builder for decades to come and we may not see these stock prices ever again. But some pain is still due, this is part of the investment process.
1981 2018-09-30 15:00:38 $NBEV $IGC $TLRY. NBEV is so much more than a CBD stock. Currently trading avg Price to Sales ratio compared to other CBD stocks trading at insane multiples.

1995 2018-09-30 14:47:16 No set template IMO. 
I have had 35% in a single stock. All depends on what you buy, 4 how long and entry price paid. 
Go for a collection of 15-20 stocks with low debt as high leverage is nothing but venom!!!
Ask - "If I have requisite capital, would I buy out the whole at CMP?"
1996 2018-09-30 14:46:39 Penny stock market has been slumbering since mid July, expected to pick up this week. 
Other than companies putting out news, I’m not posting on stocks until there’s opportunity for people to profit.  
The point for me is finding BUY entries, not sell entries.
1997 2018-09-30 14:46:24 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your bipolar disorder
1998 2018-09-30 14:45:13 The best way to get rich in stock market is to start PMS or sell SIP.
Rest of the methods like investing in stocks and MF are merely to stay rich
1999 2018-09-30 14:43:45 They have been misled into believing that EU controls our borders. That is absolutely not the case. Fishing stocks have begun to recover thanks 2 EU rules voted unanimously. EU growth has far outstepped UK's since #Brexit. Just admit U R a xenophobe #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

2008 2018-09-30 14:36:50 How will they get to us though? Border crossing backed up and fubar international travel. Worried. We need a short sighted guy to make forgeries for us. We can pay for them with our stocks and savings JRM says we will have. Assuming gift from JRM
2009 2018-09-30 14:35:07 Valuation has not been very cheap in India from 2011.. For value investors getting stocks with sustainable business at single pe with return ratios above 20% has been only a dream.

2021 2018-09-30 14:27:02 Best advice for trading stocks - buy when the investment media tells others not to.

Worst advice - when pumpers post the same stock 122 times the same day they put in a sell order, and use terms like “going through the roof”
2022 2018-09-30 14:26:39 AQD has positive cash flow, which is very rare for its type and market cap. Is that not important or less important for commodity stocks? Not very experienced in those fyi.

2024 2018-09-30 14:24:14 17 million have savings.... of less than £100. Rees Mogg offers to bail them out in the event no deal #Brexit  Or possibly they could sell some stocks and shares. No sweat.
2025 2018-09-30 14:23:04 There are many smart ways to invest. Stocks, Real Estate, but I am into forex. Unlike other investments, it requires that you lean the skill so that you can trade your money and have it work for you. It is a more active investment, but with a potentially much larger payout.
2026 2018-09-30 14:21:58 "Some may believe they can get the returns of stocks without feeling the pain, bail before a sell-off, then get back in after the coast is clear. It's a nice thought. But it just doesn't work that way."

It's never stopped ppl from spending & the ppl who have money never stopped investing either, maybe they started investing in different things like gold or bonds, maybe even more secure stocks. It hardy effects the poor&middle-class.

2050 2018-09-30 14:02:25 Hi UV, it will be helpful if you provide some guidance on position sizing . As you mentioned >6% as betting big in your case, how many stocks one should have in Portfolio to minimize the risk .

2060 2018-09-30 13:53:24 It only means that Elon Musk is covering Tesla's part of the fine. So he pays 20m + Tesla's 20m in stocks. Thats how i read that.
2061 2018-09-30 13:52:09 Lol no he did not make more money for the company, that's not how 2ndary market trading works. And the stocks fell to less than what they were before when the truth was out, so by your logic he lost money for the company anyway.
2062 2018-09-30 13:50:42 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. 
If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. 
Stocks do the same.

2063 2018-09-30 13:50:38 While  Small cap Index level will be back to normal ( as it based on survivors )  - one cannot say same for small cap stocks . Lot of these stocks ( darlings of 2017) will die off and never to surface again .. New stories will come - that is real challenge for small cap investors
2064 2018-09-30 13:50:36 Omg! Ate meron po ba new stocks sa glorietta? Kahit not official merch esp. Jin kahit fan, etc paluwas po kasi ako ulit sa manila dun lang po tlga ako sa glorietta nkakadaan
2065 2018-09-30 13:50:04 Shares are always a risk. When you invest you can’t always expect to get your money back or doubled. People who believed in Tesla and invested in stocks I’m sure won’t care about this whole thing because Tesla will rise again.
2066 2018-09-30 13:49:10 Probably lack of hype and awareness, seems most of these fund type stocks aren’t trading anywhere close to their NAV eg QCA, CGOC. Will see if the fall/winter seasonality brings them alive again else time to move on
2067 2018-09-30 13:49:04 Beans pushed higher early week. Strong demand and harvest delays helped support. The lack of trade deals continue to haunt beans but reports that Brazil and Argentina will need US beans to make commitments helped. But +22 MB 2017 production and +37 MB Stocks pulled beans to lows
2068 2018-09-30 13:48:31 Absolutely John, what I want to highlight is if one has a 6/7 years time frame for holding good resource stocks, he/she might as well retire in great comfort to pursue further interests beyond 2026 , my humble 2 c for your thoughts.
2069 2018-09-30 13:46:42 Idk why ppl are so bent over what Elon Musks does with HIS company lol especially y’all don’t own stocks lol
2070 2018-09-30 13:46:39 Been thinking that health and keep fit, and eat healthy and weight related and every related stocks and options will dive badly.

2092 2018-09-30 13:34:56 Corn pushed higher on delayed harvest progress due to rain, strong demand as exports are trending higher than last year, and variable yield reports. But a bearish Stocks report pulled corn lower. Stocks were +130 MB above expectations. Corn is trying to form a bottom.
2093 2018-09-30 13:34:07 Yeah, thinking shitcoins is the enemy is like thinking that Chinese scam stocks are the enemy of the stock market. 

However they are the enemy of the people who has grown up thinking that the state will always keep them safe from fraud.
2094 2018-09-30 13:33:44 What is going to happen when the corporate financial windfall runs out?

2100 2018-09-30 13:30:23 According to Brugler Report, USDA published Sep 01 US corn stocks at 2.14 bbu, well above trade estimate of 2.01 bbu. That was down 6.68% y/y but 6.89% larger vs Sep WASDE. 
Total export commitments through Sep 20 are 30% of USDA 18/19 projection, vs. the average of 27%

2104 2018-09-30 13:26:41 It's best not try to be oversmart or overthink in this market. Shortlist stocks where you r sure of earnings growth over next 2-3 years. Sort them by ur conviction levels and stagger your purchase. Mentally be prepared for additional drawdown after your last purchase.
2105 2018-09-30 13:26:33 Wheat struggled all week.  Exports better than expected and production concerns continue in Australia and Canada but wheat could not gain traction.

2173 2018-09-30 12:33:20 Obviously, stocks should fall when earnings are bullish. Why should they rise? :) @Deishma
2174 2018-09-30 12:32:28 Yes! I believe in many stocks u must begin as a follower, following the money and trades. U need to grow, and one day u need to become the leader! The psychology is different, the stratergy is different the the trading is different! Most will always stay a follower!

2182 2018-09-30 12:27:33 Right, because Bush Jr. handed Obama a massive deficit from 2 wars, tax cut for the rich, spending increases, and the biggest economic collapse in 80 years.

Then Obama came in, took emergency measures that literally saved the economy. Stocks up 280% under his 8 years. 🖒🖒

2191 2018-09-30 12:19:30 Hey Steve, Stocks have treated me well over the years. Do you recommend continuing to focus on one market and not playing in other markets such as forex? I’m really trying to focus again. I’ve gotten off track playing in other markets.

2197 2018-09-30 12:13:23 This was saying the same thing at every important asset price top (usually stocks, though houses in 2003-07 cycle) over the last 20 yrs (in 2003-07 cycle, housing prices topped in late 2005). Asset price declines cause the recessions.
2198 2018-09-30 12:13:04 It will be good if govt can save small investors money. The prices of certain stocks as seems are jacked up falsely. How come a bank like kotak trades with ratio of market cap to net profit at 50. After all it is not bigger than SBI. Small investors need to be protected.

2212 2018-09-30 11:53:36 Thanks @Luspank1 but I don’t follow that stock. And I usually hold onto stocks for years, not months. Not saying you can’t make money doing that, but timing these things short term is very hard

2248 2018-09-30 11:07:47 Does it make sense to invest anywhere but in the U.S?

While the S&P 500 is within 1% of its all-time high, European markets are flat, Chinese stocks are in a deep slump and the Japanese market—after a huge recent run-up—has finally clawed its way back to where it was 27
2249 2018-09-30 11:07:08 Wall Street isn’t Main Street. The majority of Americans own no stocks at all, the market being up primarily benefits people who are already wealthy—it’s not a barometer of how well middle class Americans are doing financially.

2262 2018-09-30 10:36:04 Disagree. As long as there is reasonable diversification ( maybe 5 sectors ) and you own 5 stocks . Nothing wrong with that. Let’s not get skewed by the recent 70% plunges that some stocks have seen.
2263 2018-09-30 10:34:55 India being a developing nation, too many sectors hold very good potential over the next decade or so.  Hence, 10-20 stocks may not be enough to cover the full potential. Just my experience.

2269 2018-09-30 10:26:32 Now a days it's easy to create rumours about stocks(esp. about mid & small caps), if someone says anything negative "without valid proof" just ignore such people, in fact concerned authorities should take strict action against these people.

2270 2018-09-30 10:25:51 Focused investing implies owning not less than 10 and not more than 20 stocks. Since the number of stocks is not large, diversification across sectors is the key. Too much concentration on one sector can magnify both gains and losses.

2278 2018-09-30 10:15:28 I've learned a few things; but I'll only mention 2, to keep it simple.: 1. Stocks will never run up like crazy without pulling back to some (slight, in this case) degree 2. There are a lot of bashers on twitter OTCs -- some would probably put a hit on their own mother for $50.00!

2280 2018-09-30 10:14:49 Rationale is simple. As investors pull out more money from liquid funds (so no question of fresh SIPs coming), MFs will be forced to sell their holdings. As most of the premium stocks r out of shape, they wil sell left out premium stocks. Next, HDFC, Oracle, TCS, EICHER, MRF?

2284 2018-09-30 10:06:10 A lot of the 'owners' are tracking funds that have to buy those stocks anyway, at the end of the day they couldn't care a toss about the company but by loaning the stock they can make extra income.
2285 2018-09-30 10:03:51 Ronnie—under what conditions would you sell your gold? As fiat price of gold increases, the likelihood you want to sell your gold decreases, especially if rapid rise occurs. Is it keep physical gold and sell the mining stocks? What would you buy with your gold?

2292 2018-09-30 09:51:06 Certainly, you can barely go wrong with an index. It's funny that I am doing the same but for popular US stocks. Buying a tech index and waiting for a crash to scoop up some Google, Microsoft, Apple, Cisco etc.
2293 2018-09-30 09:50:30 OI is only for 200 odd stocks
2294 2018-09-30 09:50:12 The smoking weed that made the stocks drop
2295 2018-09-30 09:49:57 Ok then pls tell how are u suppose to check oi of all 2000 stocks
2296 2018-09-30 09:48:27 Ultimately the industry needs something like this to value cryptos. Stocks have PE ratios etc, whilst NVT isn't perfect it's probably going to be the best metric we have for valuing coins imo.

2298 2018-09-30 09:43:01 #marr @theresa_may What about absolutely any other subject than Brexit?! Don't let the witch deflect on to Labour. Do your job. Apologise to camera May, before we chuck you in the stocks.

2303 2018-09-30 09:36:49 And stocks in which i have already invested are not in profit
2304 2018-09-30 09:36:18 The biggest problm is of investment because i have not money no purchase new stock but actual problm is that if i have money now and i purchase new stocks but there is no such promise or any initiative by govmnt that the market will not move down
2305 2018-09-30 09:35:52 Even almost every major stocks on results day but before results are out
2306 2018-09-30 09:35:11 Why would people flock to a risky investment that the vast majority still no nothing about? If the shit DOES hit the fan (still an almighty if!) then people will be looking for safe bets. They’re not going to flee from property and stocks into something more risky!
2307 2018-09-30 09:34:54 @MJSCarney @billbirtles @abcnews Great piece on China’s huge fishing fleets effect on fish stocks globally. critical piece missing though; how the ‘patriotic fishing fleet’ becomes an integral piece of China’s maritime militia especially out of Hainan in the SCS @AndrewSErickson

2319 2018-09-30 09:09:35 After 1,5 years of solely dividend stocks I decided to add some strong non-dividend stocks for the future. I'm still a DGI investor in the long term and fiercly hope BABA will pay a dividend down the road!
2320 2018-09-30 09:09:24 not worried. I lost 10 grand in one day on marijuana stocks but made it back 2 months later. Trust the system and patience is key. I trust you my friend!

2323 2018-09-30 09:07:33 Funny thing... two no dividend stocks. 
2324 2018-09-30 09:07:14 Dr D R Rao (Neuland Labs CMD) in an interview to Business Standard said this years ago - “Chinese API are cheaper but that’s their only advantage; Indian quality is superior”. Good quality API stocks been multi baggers even when China was business as usual (pre 2015)

De plus les gens ne vont pas forcément se rabattre sur amd pour autant.
2326 2018-09-30 09:03:30 Sir I think from now on large one should also fall? Why index is managed by few stocks. Who is doing this sir? If our market is for only 10-12 stocks  , then no need of TV channel,  analyst,  PMS,  star fund manger  etc.

2329 2018-09-30 08:59:08 We all grow from our mistakes. We learn valuable lessons from mistakes. Mistakes teach us we can do things differently. Take stocks of the things you have done. To the new community you are going to, things can be done differently
2330 2018-09-30 08:58:29 Stocks do it all the time it’s a way to boost the price they take it out of circulation but do not affect the total supply just circ
2331 2018-09-30 08:57:40 Hey Lisa, I've rung the Bradford superstore & talked to a manager. They're having a problem with fresh stocks now & are working to change that. They are trying to get as many staff as possible on to the tills at busy times. Stephen

great, no eating lunch then
2334 2018-09-30 08:50:39 That doesn't sound very patriotic! In the stocks with you, you deeply unhelpful filthy remainer!

2338 2018-09-30 08:45:23 If fresh money doesnt come next week, the selling of blue chip stocks will intensify, as in case of Maruti, Hero, etc from MFs as panic striken investors r withdrawing money from liquid funds, then LT investors start selling to protect their capital. Regulators shud wake up, now

2345 2018-09-30 08:29:57 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. ~ Peter Lynch
2346 2018-09-30 08:28:31 UBL &  TATA GLOBAL BEVERAGE could be one of the favorite stocks in short term. Watch out for them

2348 2018-09-30 08:28:02 Hi. This weekend I received an email from Get Stocks saying my account had been debited with a MF Fee? I can see from social media that they have gone under but I can’t understand how I’m still being charged something. Did you get to a point of conclusion with them?
2349 2018-09-30 08:28:00 Had fun at BGW22. Met lots of ppl. Need to work on my mentals tho. I tend to go into a match without properly analyzing my opponent. Leads me to do random aerials i hope to hit. I even SDed my stocks away lol. Im determined to get better and be the best falcon in japan ahhh

Monthly close is my 1st filter for swing/ ST trades over next month (or sometimes LT investment).

#trading #investment #Nifty #stocks
2351 2018-09-30 08:25:09 Its inevitable and the right approach for mass adoption in the long term  - the average consumer should not be investing in single stocks, bonds, crypto-assets.
2352 2018-09-30 08:24:58 Good data niteen. My takeaway: strong lead indicators for upcoming index crash are 1.more than 50%stocks at 52wk high & 2. Strong divergence between this indicator and index
2353 2018-09-30 08:24:03 I think it’s bogus that you might go to someone’s profile snoopin and click their pic and it plays their lil story which tells them you were there,...   Facebook you sneaky sumbitch y’all keep playin and your stocks keep dropping don’t act like I ain’t warn you,.,

2364 2018-09-30 08:05:15 FAANG stocks like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft are in many funds and hold a large portion of US $. Over 600 ETF’s include FAANG with heavy position.

2367 2018-09-30 08:03:56 I think the fastest way for poor people to balance out inequality as a whole is to learn how to trade stocks and beating the rich at their own game
2368 2018-09-30 08:02:31 ...all fish should be line caught...remember the cod wars?...all this "we can fish what we want" malarky is quite simply bollocks...we can't...there won't be any left...stocks haven't recovered from the 70's...

2370 2018-09-30 07:57:44 Thank you. There's a lot of hype around tech stocks but you have to be in a right time. I was lucky to get in when is was valued at around £5mcap (if memory serves me corrctly). Always look at the valuation of a company and look at what value it can, reasonably generate.
2371 2018-09-30 07:56:16 My local Aldi currently stocks lots of everyday food products. It has the  on many products. I personally couldn’t care less what is on a product. If I want it, I buy it. Worrying about flags is just childish.

2377 2018-09-30 07:48:25 When there was severe NPA problem plaguing PSU banks , every one was telling that NBFC were natural beneficiaries because of the problems in PSU banks.

Now PSU banks and NBFCs are in problems. Then who will be the beneficiaries ? is it Private banks?
2378 2018-09-30 07:46:24 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
2379 2018-09-30 07:41:23 Yes; that's one of the probabilities, considering the highly oversold nature of stocks, having corrected 50%-65% in some cases.. However, some stocks done 5 waves while others have upside potential. Pref view posted; yours an alt. view with a 50:50 chance.

2389 2018-09-30 07:17:55 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
2390 2018-09-30 07:17:10 retail investors forget basic asset allocation rules when they see bull markets. 

also tilt towards small cap and midcap stocks ensures that portfolio crashes in a crash. Then they blame markets. 

One must respect and follow investing basics.

2396 2018-09-30 07:05:43 97 % of businesses in India are not meant for long-term. People think that every stock they buy can be held for the next 10 years and when they lose money, they blame #warren. So, before u buy the next 10-year story, make sure that you are buying from 3% of entire listed stocks.

2399 2018-09-30 07:00:43 I had an idea about putting the worst offenders in stocks on the steps of the Lincoln memorial, on a rotating schedule, and allowing passers by to slap the shit out of them as they please. Open-handed slaps only, but pissing in their face is acceptable as well.

2407 2018-09-30 06:52:05 In 2006, one third of stocks traded in US and European Union was traded through Algorithmic Trading, a trading system heavily reliant on the mathematical formulas, high speed algorithms & computer programming.

2409 2018-09-30 06:50:58 Remove select stocks like Baj fin, TCS, HDFC twins etc, even sensex would have reached 25k levels. I think bear market started with LTCG tax for wider market and is visible to everyone with the fall of HFCs. Now only IT, speciality chem, paper are doing well in the market.

2419 2018-09-30 06:37:58 If at all a decision is taken, and there is balancing act, which sector and stocks would you pick. ?
2420 2018-09-30 06:36:39 Unlike earlier period mixing powders-cream and water is not a milk business even with EU's accessible stocks.
2421 2018-09-30 06:36:30 The best time to avoid media and news is when stocks are going down.
Second best time to avoid is when stocks are going up.
2422 2018-09-30 06:34:59 That's the reason why innocent investors like us should always stay with  large cap companies only. Return maybe less. But atleast there's a security of our investment. @RBI @SEBI_India @NSEIndia @BSEIndia @FinMinIndia #Nifty #India #equity #market #NSE #BSE #SEBI #stocks
2423 2018-09-30 06:34:58 But how has it performed compared to a decent portfolio of tech stocks? Apple, Amazon or Google?
2424 2018-09-30 06:34:45 if you owned public stocks in a company, and then the ceo announced he was going to plan to take those public stocks away to go private, you would sell. This forces the price skyrocketing up, hence the charges by the SEC.
2425 2018-09-30 06:34:09 Dairy Coop have missed the policy dictum 70 % summer  to 100 post monsoon collection capacity -- must find ways to high end products or sell milk to others incl pvt sector. There is no powder-cream route as EU -Australia have access stocks.
2426 2018-09-30 06:32:52 I will pass your sound advice on to my unemployed clients At Wednesday’s Job Club. They do like to check the position of their stocks and shares, and trade some equity on the futures market, whilst looking for minimum wage jobs at Tesco...

2429 2018-09-30 06:31:30 So why didn't they fine all the short sellers that peddle fake news, just so to effect the stocks and make money for them self.

2438 2018-09-30 06:20:09 Another strategy can be fundamental based stocks. Where stocks with strong fundamental are chosen so that risk of loss gets reduced. Simlarly there can be more smart strategies aim being to reduce risk and volatility.
2439 2018-09-30 06:19:50 there is proof stating that my friend alr asked the fs and she replied all sold out, what more do i have to do to prove to you that she has no stocks???
2440 2018-09-30 06:18:26 Where as Smart beta funds are formed with diff strategies like volatility. Here index is formed by stocks with historical low volatility so that risk becomes less.

2442 2018-09-30 06:17:54 Short sellers/media manipulates stocks and GETS ILL GAINS from this.
Sadly  SEC prob on the same band wagon...
2443 2018-09-30 06:15:53 Normally ETFs/Indices are formed on the basis of Market Cap of companies. Eg- Nifty50, nifty midcap, Bse smallcap etc. Here risk/ volatility can be very high depending upon performance of stocks chosen with criteria only being Mcap.
2444 2018-09-30 06:13:08 Why Nifty 500.Are the stocks in pf from that index.
2445 2018-09-30 06:13:00 ‘ in relation to gun rights as it supports the maintenance of all current firearms regulations, as well as the criminalization of ‘3D Printed Guns,’ a ban on bump stocks, and has stated (POTUS) it supports gun confiscation without due process.

2450 2018-09-30 06:09:40 Aint no damn way the fucking XMen movies should be laughing stocks. No way.
2451 2018-09-30 06:07:31 nssjsus WHY IS HE OPENING THE STOCKS HAHAHAHA
2452 2018-09-30 06:05:55 A good read Damian; many thoughts and approach similar to my own. In fact, I currently own or have recently owned 11 of the stocks on your folio list with a further 7 sitting on my watch list for several months; seems we have a similar approach.
2453 2018-09-30 06:03:39 Of course but..
If you are selecting stocks at high INDEX PE and expect to perform it will be foolish..
Majority follow the index..very few stocks will move against the index trend..

IN 2008 all stocks followed the index..
Now also banking stocks are following the BANK NIFTY..
2454 2018-09-30 06:02:23 LMAOOO RIGHT. i mean he doesnt need to open the drawers bc those are extra stocks but hahahaha
2455 2018-09-30 06:00:48 Hopefully they will know which is permanent loss and move on to some other stocks to rather than attaching ego to existing stocks.

2457 2018-09-30 05:57:20 You found a tweet from January? Maybe it’s time you got over it. Thanks to Dough, I’ve invested significant amounts to stocks he has brought forth and very pleased with the outcome.
2458 2018-09-30 05:54:51 @TalibKweli I go all in against all your assests and commodities, all your cash, your bonds, stocks and banck accounts. Wagering against that I can't pull sticky, mef,red,bizy, crazy,ice,cube,ice,tea,or,my,  he knows who is is, that dirty ass monster... Lol... Reversed
2459 2018-09-30 05:53:42 Everyone says...even me also... long-term investment...but if one of the stock in your portfolio down by 80-90% ,what else left with remaining stocks return??
2460 2018-09-30 05:53:15 They lost 13% on stocks ... doesnt sound good to me.
2461 2018-09-30 05:52:57 Sila na mismo naghahanap sa stocks sa the saem HAHAHAHAH
2462 2018-09-30 05:52:15 Not some, all Apple Stocks 
2463 2018-09-30 05:51:08 And yet Bump Stocks STILL legal. National disgrace.
2464 2018-09-30 05:50:52 It's not index but the selection of stocks that determines the success of your portfolio.
2465 2018-09-30 05:49:25 If I have enough money to invest in say stocks I also have enough that I'm living a comfortable like 99% of the time. Investments are not done by the common person out there working a 9 to 5 job. They are done by people that are already rich.
2466 2018-09-30 05:47:53 What is it  you’re into stocks? Dm me lol
2467 2018-09-30 05:46:07 Google bought YouTube for US$1.65 billion in stocks just 18 months after YouTube's creation.
2468 2018-09-30 05:42:24 What stocks do you recommend?
2469 2018-09-30 05:41:20 my elite team of social media strategists at Jillaboon Incorporated: ma'am it's been 20 days since your last tweet, stocks are dropping

me: hmmm alright here goes nothing *slides keyboard tray out* the McGurk effect but with pussy and bussy
2470 2018-09-30 05:40:08 That still doesn't rationalize the decision making process. New leader can affect the performance of company base on decisions. Thus still affecting stocks. Good or bad.  So either way the argument  is flaw. Government Institutions were never meant to have such control.
2471 2018-09-30 05:39:38 Panirado nalang mo oyy wla man moy mga stocks
2472 2018-09-30 05:39:19 Uhh, he willfully misled stockholders and announced his company was going to buy back stocks and become private again, he said the funding was secured when it very much wasn’t. Hence why it was the SEC that he settled with.
2473 2018-09-30 05:35:26 Ehat is interesting ia unlike in 2008 this time sensex has hardly corrected while 50% stocks are at 52 week low
2474 2018-09-30 05:35:02 Many people miss the profit buy not selling. There are very few stocks that can be held for decades that too with proper surveillance. So, hold the stocks till the things turn -ve (disruption, cycle change, debt..etc) for the company. Hundreds of opportunity available in mkts.
2475 2018-09-30 05:34:04 Maine’s lippie is restocking. Check her ig story for branches that will release extra stocks.
2476 2018-09-30 05:31:22 Blockchain is a buzzword.  Cryptocurrencies are mostly just the new penny stocks.  ICO's are generally start-up scams.  I have yet to see a d'app that was useful to the real world in any way, especially once their native chain has lost its immutability.
2477 2018-09-30 05:31:03 @marc cohodes is a fraud and short stocks by lying. He is a liar mother fagra. He should be in prison for stealing people money shorting the stock and making wealth for himself. I hope they get burn in the hell.
2478 2018-09-30 05:29:07 E. And then came a host of NBFCs like ZEN Global, CRB  etc and sprouting of Benefit Funds which funneled large parts of inflows into stocks which created a mini mania .
2479 2018-09-30 05:27:58 @AskRobinhood  Love your App! Please consider adding this Feature: Up/Down Arrows to indicate the direction Stocks R currently moving. Rather than referring to it's Previous closing price or the price I paid. 
As of now, there is no way to know the "Optimal time to Sell". THANKS
2480 2018-09-30 05:24:35 Did you ever called an USD a “Bill Gates” or some stocks “Warren Buffets” just because they own a lot?
Better keep conversations correct and clear. Otherwise you can as well go to the pub “to drink and talk crap...”
2481 2018-09-30 05:24:04 Me persigue el problema de los flujos versus los stocks. No lo entienden!
2482 2018-09-30 05:24:01 That would be the most reasonable guess, I agree. He'll have to pay, but even 1/2 will be substantial.

A problem w/ his wealth, that is rarely discussed, is that most of his wealth is in stocks he acquired when they were cheap. If he has to sell, he's due big cap gain tax.
2483 2018-09-30 05:23:37 It is about time @SEBI_India places restrictions on the content being discussed during market hours. I am very interested in knowing on how stocks are picked up for discussion by blue channels and why they show intra day graph when stock is reviewed by 'expert'
2484 2018-09-30 05:23:31 both bc i refuse to believe rgz is underage when one of them buys stocks at age 18 and the other is essentially a housewife at 17
2485 2018-09-30 05:22:50 SAn born and Telsa's boss, Elton Musk, was fined by the Stocks Commission after he tried to impress his girlfriend by lying about the value of Telsa's shares.
2486 2018-09-30 05:22:43 Higher chance he can switch in better stocks and bring it back up.

2492 2018-09-30 05:16:49 Tesla stocks would have been higher if it wasn't for that tweet. Now investors are slowly buying again.
2493 2018-09-30 05:15:43 Investors are far more attracted towards buying stocks which are down 50-60% and try to be proud of bargain buys.They are down for a reason.
2494 2018-09-30 05:14:24 Some people are hell bent on putting politics before the welfare of our country. Most of them may own stocks (wealthy) or they are the group who don't give a damn about civil rights, but would vote against their best interest. Only theirs, which are some distorted view.
2495 2018-09-30 05:14:00 Whooping 85% correction

"Bottoms in the investment world don't end with four-year lows; they end with 10- or 15-year lows." - Jim Rogers

It's important to wait for atleast 9-13 months on stocks that have started falling.
2496 2018-09-30 05:13:52 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

2502 2018-09-30 05:08:57 Not that much sir but yeah around 25 percent. Right now I am in dilemma whether to avg some of the stocks or not . That's why asking to your asset class because u generally said about index fund, can you share ur experience. It will be helpful. Thanks

I also receive full benefits, co stocks and a monthly discount.
2507 2018-09-30 05:03:24 In this Chaos wher 30% capital erosion has occurred restructuring is a piped dream. Stable stocks have lost value thanks to the noise.

2515 2018-09-30 04:57:09 Monday is the one year anniversary of the massacre in Las Vegas. Many thought that could be the tipping point with respect to gun control...or at the very least for bump stocks to be banned.
It’s 2018...Bump Stocks are still legal in the USA! Absolute disgrace.

2520 2018-09-30 04:46:33 @Stash the last time I checked, you bundled legal marijuana stocks with Big Tobacco! BAD MOVE!
2521 2018-09-30 04:46:12 After elon musk steps down as the chairman. I think the stocks are going to plummet. This will enable Musk to afford to purchase the approximately 25% of the company he needs to control and make it private. lol That just my theory.
2522 2018-09-30 04:46:08 Bro learning about stocks and bonds is so much more exhausting than I thought lmao

2525 2018-09-30 04:44:18 Annuity? Stocks and Bonds? Mortgage? HAHAHAHA
2526 2018-09-30 04:42:45 If you think stocks are assets and generate good income , then buy stocks. Else don't buy single stock.
2527 2018-09-30 04:42:33 Because Japan will become the very first country to experience the highly aged society, she will have the privilege of exporting the first-hand services to the rest of the following countries. That's another reason to bet on Japanese stocks.
2528 2018-09-30 04:41:13 I thought about making a dark humor joke about bump stocks still being legal, on a thread about a certain gathering, and thought better of it.
2529 2018-09-30 04:40:41 Don’t we all. Probably stocks and bonds and cash along with instructions of how to hide it.
2530 2018-09-30 04:39:06 hte fame is getting to me... I'm relying on my Weetabix stocks to buy me Pariston lovers
2531 2018-09-30 04:37:52 If there's one thing we've learned, it's that Trump loves when "his people" are made laughing stocks on the global stage. He's not self aware enough to recognize when it happens to him, but you know he's hyper sensitive to how others make him look...#SNL mightve saved the country
2532 2018-09-30 04:37:40 Imagine being limited to buying and selling stocks to 9-5 on M-F only..what year is it?

2536 2018-09-30 04:33:32 We all know about how huge wealth creators like Berkshire, Amazon and Apple had more than 50% drawdowns multiple times. We somehow think our stocks would be immune to such falls. No stock has any divine protection to avoid these drawdowns.
2537 2018-09-30 04:33:32 Flaherty gives us hope
2538 2018-09-30 04:33:03 I get what you're saying, it's just that dozens of these M16A2s have been missing from the army stocks since the fall of Mosul, that's all
2539 2018-09-30 04:32:19 BTC amd stocks are highly correlated.  There is enough data to confirm this.  Gold and BTC should go up.  But this collapse is going to be deflationary. The worst kind of recession/depression.
2540 2018-09-30 04:31:10 My gosh should I pre-order or should i just wait na magkaroon ng available stocks yung album dito asfagagafaf putaena
2541 2018-09-30 04:30:44 I want them in stocks on the White House lawn so the public can throw rotten vegetables at them just like medieval times. After what they’ve put us thru, they deserve it.

2546 2018-09-30 04:26:54 @elonmusk You left. Stocks plummeted.

2548 2018-09-30 04:25:46 She hasn’t received the money yet. Her lawyers are all “pro bono.”  She doesn’t need the money. The company she does research for is worth billions. She has stocks. She is far wealthier than Kavanaugh.  Whom will also donate to a charity.
2549 2018-09-30 04:25:36 One of the reasons I've stayed away from WhatsApp groups on investing is they pumped up stocks like crazy and now are spreading fear like a contagion. Interfering will mind will through excess is a big time -ve for good decision making
2550 2018-09-30 04:23:25 just saw the financial statements of infibeam... it was at a P/E equivalent to amazon....

It is better to avoid high P/E stocks in mid cap and smallcap segment...

lots of retail investors have burned their hand in infibeam

2553 2018-09-30 04:15:54 How about force the SEC to look on those shorts who always spread misinformation. It's insane SEC let the Shorts lurk in the market destroying the stocks. We still don't know what will happen if the 420 went thru,when it happens then elon don't secure the fund in time,the sue him
2554 2018-09-30 04:14:08 Stash doesn’t charge for your trades but it’s a little different from actual trades like Etrade. With Stash it designed to keep bevhkners from losing everything. Of course you can still invest what you want but your limited to the stocks they offer. And all at ETF groupings.

2560 2018-09-30 04:11:03 if someone actually bought $TSlA at $380 and recently sold at $260, they shouldn’t buy individual stocks. Better to buy mutual fund and let the fund manager do all trading. Smart investors bought more on Friday. Next week 2 catalysts that are going to  $TSLA: SEC and Sept #.

2571 2018-09-30 03:55:43 Look at the bright side. When I started in 1999 there were death threat threads,  2 people murdered in New Jersey.  Janice shell giving so many people problems.  The mob was influencing otc stocks. Rough time to trade.

 5 trillion in cash needs to be laundered every year, that's a lot of cheddar for struggling businesses and stocks to pad their bottom line. The profits have to come from somewhere.
 They're not shooting their cash cow any time soon.

2622 2018-09-30 02:58:55 Plus, Target actually stocks some good board games!
2623 2018-09-30 02:56:37 And that's why we dont race stupid stocks.
2624 2018-09-30 02:55:37 Read my article "Are Bonds Risky?" @lindasstocks.com... Stocks are superior to bonds... history has proven this!
2625 2018-09-30 02:54:24 Done mostly with penny stocks or thinly traded stock

2627 2018-09-30 02:52:50 The posting and whatsapping of Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch quotes is inversely related to stock market moves

2633 2018-09-30 02:49:37 The Volitility in stocks is so high that if you are doing Strangles on them, it should not be more than 1-2 lots which is fine because of the fantastic Premium you get. Also you should be even further OTM.
2634 2018-09-30 02:48:50 I would be in! It actually would be super dope to learn about stocks and stuff! Cause I’m clueless! This would be a great platform!

2638 2018-09-30 02:45:48 He tweeted that he was thinking about taking tesla private bc he had the funds to do so. But he was just saying that to get his stocks to go up in value. It's illegal to do that
2639 2018-09-30 02:45:39 right. He didn’t sell his stocks after driving it up, but he likely did intend to hurt shorts. Irony
2640 2018-09-30 02:45:38 Value guy. Tell me which stocks are undervalued and you can’t pick Tilray.
2641 2018-09-30 02:45:07 People underestimated the ferocity of drawdowns in mid n smallcap stocks . Most of people in market now has not  seen or forgot the blood bath of 2008 they do t realise how ugly Mkt can get .
2642 2018-09-30 02:43:05 I wonder that too....I don’t see stocks, even same sector stocks, this correlated.
2643 2018-09-30 02:42:56 Did he not make lots of money illegally in stocks by one tweet?? He tried to fool all his stake holders by his tweet.
2644 2018-09-30 02:41:47 Beto is absolutely correct on this issue....We don’t need corporate welfare! They are investing in stocks in their own companies not higher wages for their workers. Trickle down economics does not work!!!
2645 2018-09-30 02:41:26 Sir, correct me if i am wrong,you are suggesting a decentralized system of wealth distribution in which companies are persuaded to take care of their labour force by gifting them company stocks
2646 2018-09-30 02:40:58 I outlined it above. Lodes of capital will rush into crypto as a "safe haven" (as compared to stocks,bonds, ETFs, etc that will become worthless literally overnight) even more so now that so much of the population at least knows of bitcoin's existence
2647 2018-09-30 02:40:48 OYO valuations built on perceptions, with zero asset support and negative cash flows.. Hotel stocks own assets on the ground..The first is ethereal, the latter more real..So this disruption model could well be reset when VC money & bigger fool theory, runs out..

2651 2018-09-30 02:37:35 Please confirm your post before u post. Its under investigation if the tweet was a joke. Or if it was intentional.

According to what we see, it was intentional to drive up stocks. Please retract.

2653 2018-09-30 02:36:21 These statements are Soo true in 2016 I made a profit in penny stocks by blindly picking stocks. My first year trading actually (got lucky). Last year tried the same stategy lost big. This year not so much bc it's about learning and improving as a trader.

2658 2018-09-30 02:28:31 Not the best measure. What's happening to the median wealth household? What about those at the bottom end of the distribution? Those actually in need of gains don't own stocks or homes. #Priorities

2674 2018-09-30 02:09:32 But if it holds those levels, it's a simple correction and we got to buy some good stocks. I cud be wrong, but that's what the charts says as on date. A global even or consecutive good quarterly results could make our analysis useless.
2675 2018-09-30 02:08:19 $FB, $TWTR and $SNAP all under pressure.  I think all will underperform until late this year due to data privacy issues and tax loss selling.  2019 could be much better for these stocks.  FB is still a great business, TWTR has untapped earnings potential and SNAP gets acquired.

2682 2018-09-30 01:56:22 @elonmusk The SEC, in its effort to save investors money, sinks Tesla stocks.  Tesla stocks on sale...buy more
2683 2018-09-30 01:55:26 Tesla was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon, and now I'm a changed man. You can take away title, all my stocks & shares, but one thing you can't take away ....I am  Elon musk
@Iron_Man @elonmusk
2684 2018-09-30 01:54:48 With Elon Musk to step down as Tesla chairman & remain CEO, many will wonder what's the difference b/w the two roles. He'll still be steering the ship, but should he steer wildly, the new chairman will pull him into line. Stocks should recover. Happy days for investors.
2685 2018-09-30 01:54:44 Elon musk didn’t tweet lies, he attempted to influence publicly traded stocks by implying he was taking the company private. Also, Donald trump won the election fair and square through the electoral college. You’re comparing completely different scenarios.
2686 2018-09-30 01:52:51 Why isn’t the SEC accused by the SEC of manipulating Tesla stocks? 
What happened to the freedom of speech? Seems like the only thing that matters in the US is that you can proudly carry a gun.
2687 2018-09-30 01:52:21 Tesla was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon, and now I'm a changed man. You can take away title, all my stocks & shares, but one thing you can't take away ....I am  Elon musk

2689 2018-09-30 01:51:07 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. ~ Peter Lynch
2690 2018-09-30 01:50:42 I never complained about him getting a day off.
2691 2018-09-30 01:50:25 I don’t take anything g you say as gospel,  you aren’t that smart
2692 2018-09-30 01:50:08 His penance should be in stocks in the town square with tons of free tomatoes on hand.
2693 2018-09-30 01:49:59 He is just one step ahead of everyone.
1. Cash out when stocks are at an all time high.
2. Smoke weed and do shit to cause stocks prices to plummet.
3. Take Tesla private at half the original cost.
2694 2018-09-30 01:49:26 First off don’t take my comments on Yelich as gospel. I was joking with Bart Winkler.
2695 2018-09-30 01:49:02 It since that day off,  he has been the best player in baseball and has giving brewers a chance at division and put them in playoffs,

2697 2018-09-30 01:48:32 @ChuckFreimund and there is his Baltimore moment!!!!
2698 2018-09-30 01:47:15 You also complained when Yelich was sat the day before and off day.  I am sick and tired of the comments about things you have no idea about.  Would you rather have Hader?, Jeffers? Who most likely are being saved for game 163 or WC game ,  it ain’t about right now all the time
2699 2018-09-30 01:46:31 Forget about stocks. Use a VPN and go 100* on @BitMEXdotcom
2700 2018-09-30 01:45:58 I don’t fuck around with the stocks of companies run by volatile ceos with a debt problem. That goes for buying *and* shorts.

2704 2018-09-30 01:43:13 Elon Musk has paid SEC for his stupid tweet. Now, what is SEC going to do about the vast army of short-sellers who seed and feed bad publicity about the stocks they short in order to drive the price down? That one is prosecuted and not the other is just a breath-taking injustice.
2705 2018-09-30 01:42:49 I'm saddened by your having to step down as CEO OF TESLA on the news and word of Tesla stocks gone down from the negative news.
2706 2018-09-30 01:42:45 Stock can remain overbought for long time their are enough example. But yes their are so many people who have identified the fall and in many stocks.
Sir you haven't identified the fall it doesn't mean their is some operator or insider thing going on.
2707 2018-09-30 01:42:42 Fuck Bayonetta such a dumb character stop stealing stocks away from my favorite players
2708 2018-09-30 01:42:26 This isn't the story of EVERY Amzn associate.  Starting wage is set at a level that is competitive with similar businesses surrounding the FCs.  Once hired FT, there are raises every 6 months (2 years,) a monthly bonus, full medical benefits, 401k,Co stocks & opps to promote.

2712 2018-09-30 01:38:48 So the booking company was incorporated and then that acts as an umbrella for all petty lawsuits.  Now the only dif for most of us is what we get to call course and that some ppl get both cash and stocks instead of just cash
2713 2018-09-30 01:36:46 Today's so called Science is entirely dependent on Federal Grant Money as well as corporate support it is no longer Science in the classical sense. It is also created with 100 percent political intent as so many of you legislators are heavily leveraged into related stocks.

Even today many stocks are overvalued. Can any analyst predict these will erode more than 60%?
2720 2018-09-30 01:30:38 Let the bears short the shit out of all those stocks. They will be squeez the hell out and then the fundamentals will pump the price even higher
2721 2018-09-30 01:30:14 See the difference here? Dems want the money to help people. Hungry people, sick people, the working poor, the “least” among us. Rethugs only want money to buy more stocks, more yachts, more jets. MoreMoreMoreMoreMoreMore! Greed will be their undoing

2754 2018-09-30 00:57:38 Hi! Sadly we only have limited stocks, I'll let you know if @decadeintherain will add few wristbands. For now I just include you on the waiting list :)
2755 2018-09-30 00:57:31 | + something to entertain myself or the days tend to blend together and drag on. Stocks and bonds mixed in with a few investments with local banks keep me rather occupied for the most part, and furthermore, also allows me the ability to learn of those I can soon expect down +
2756 2018-09-30 00:57:14 Yeah personally I think it will grow great over the next year or so. I’m just surprised by how often people confuse these stocks as being illegal to own because of our nations federal laws. I hope that in the next 5-10 years the USA will pass our own version of C45! :)
2757 2018-09-30 00:56:15 Two leading edge consumer discretionary stocks. Exactly like you referenced.
2758 2018-09-30 00:54:33 Really? The economy and stocks are doing great and N Korea is not scaring the hell out of people, he can campaign. Remember how often Obama campaigned? A lot. Unless he was gulfing.
2759 2018-09-30 00:53:51 @GregMannarino with many stocks knocking at record highs aapl, Amzn etc aren’t you the least bit suspicious they purposely delayed Kavanaugh a week so once he’s cleared they bust thru new highs? I guarantee you will these gangsters know ahead of time what’s gonna happen.
2760 2018-09-30 00:53:48 Etrade saves me every time. Get into stocks guys
2761 2018-09-30 00:53:40 2008 even defensive fmcg fell 50 percent. People with small n midcaps lost 80 percent or more. Those invested in kachra lost capital forever. But nothing like great depression when stocks like GE fell 90 percent
2762 2018-09-30 00:53:29 Once pensions started investing in riskier stocks, they all performed poorly. They’re supposed to be a safe, boring, predictable way to supplement retirement. Haven’t been that for quite some time. Not that they’re even really available to most people.
2763 2018-09-30 00:52:44 I mean .0001. The stocks that are trading into the hundred millions are eventually going to move up normally within a week or two. I sell out at .002 that that way I have made 100% of my money I take my initial investment out and play my winnings
2764 2018-09-30 00:52:39 in here talking bout stocks and damnnnnnn, i need to get back on my shit
2765 2018-09-30 00:51:34 Kevin, you’re definitely one of my top follows on twitter. I appreciate all of your commentary on stocks and NFL (among other things). Grateful to be able to pick your experienced brain in these areas  It’s a pleasure to communicate with you 
2766 2018-09-30 00:51:26 Just play your winnings take out some and continue to play the winnings. Here's my strategy it may be b******* to some but it made me some money go to the OTC market pick out the stocks that have high volume in the last 4 weeks but the Price Is Still Rock Bottom and by that I
2767 2018-09-30 00:51:00 Yeah man): 

I've been following everything about Tesla and Elon musk for years now, monitoring stocks and all the news. Seeing this struck me in the heart
2768 2018-09-30 00:45:17 Beautiful day here in Mass today. I’m really interested to know your recommendations about investments and stocks
2769 2018-09-30 00:44:34 My money, my gains,  my losses. I have been trading stocks since I was 18 years old. I previously Works in a financial institution and I have held a series 63 Series 6 and Series 7 license I think I know what I'm doing.
2770 2018-09-30 00:43:49 Little do they know they'll be banned from the USA for owning weed stocks
2771 2018-09-30 00:42:41 BOOM haha the shittest of shitcoins hit over 40% return for me while I slept. $CV I cannot lie I love penny stocks/tokens
2772 2018-09-30 00:42:22 I read it. And I think they want him away from the stocks of the company cause he lied to the public. and made their stock go up. But he can still operate the company as normal
2773 2018-09-30 00:42:12 It's a reasonable fear since we #vote for politicians who won't even ban bump stocks.
2774 2018-09-30 00:41:31 Good, the more shorts the better. I love short covering rallies. Heck you guys are good for half the stocks value. Keep up the good work.
2775 2018-09-30 00:41:22 For a long time, many investors have relied on government regulators to protect them against fraud.  With cryptos, you are on your own. Those who don't like it perhaps should limit themselves to regulated investments like stocks or bonds.

2789 2018-09-30 00:30:02 ... well if I had to talk about stocks (BTC is not a stock) I would answer with Apple/Microsoft/Intel then Google/Facebook/Amazon as stages of the Third Industrial Revolution plays out.
2790 2018-09-30 00:27:37 Tengo una pyme metalmecánica. Se en que la industria nacional no está en condiciones de tomar personal. Las grandes empresas tienen completos sus stocks y están realizando tareas de mantenimiento. Cuando terminen comenzarán a dejar gente en la calle.
2791 2018-09-30 00:26:34 I like both of you, Very Much, but be humble, investing in cheap stocks is not rocket science. Keep up the good work.
2792 2018-09-30 00:24:33 There are very few people who do "investment shorts," it is very difficult. I have a long term portfolio of stocks. But no long term shorts.  Lots of trading shorts.

2803 2018-09-30 00:16:42 The S&P 1500, or S&P Composite 1500 Index, is a stock market index of US stocks made by Standard & Poor's. It includes all stocks in the S&P 500, S&P 400, and S&P 600.
2804 2018-09-30 00:14:09 I’m not a 1%er. I’m makeing generous returns and I only stated with 1500 and turned it into 2k and continued snow balling it. Go to yahoo finance and check different stocks look back at their history a year or 2 ago compared to where they are now . Your jaw will drop. #justdoit

2807 2018-09-30 00:12:28 We no longer live in a society. We live in a dystopia that’s gone back in time.

2865 2018-09-28 23:44:45 Investing Tip!

How to avoid risk in stocks: always understand the company you are buying, how it makes money and if it has a high chance to get bigger in 10 years.

A stock is a company! Not a lotto ticket!

2866 2018-09-28 23:44:37 You brought up great points! I’m not mad at @WWE for giving the me opportunity but I know I gave my body up for them as did so many others!

2867 2018-09-28 23:44:06 Tickers are made not-tradable, due to low average price and/or low average volume - It is a sign that the broker’s department of risk management has deemed the particular stock too volatile to trade.
Stocks with an average price +$10 & average daily volume +200k are tradable.

2883 2018-09-28 23:19:05 There is a textbook sell signal in stocks now. There are momentum divergences w/ breadth leading lower, and growth leadership has gone nowhere for weeks, and finally the October seasonality.

2893 2018-09-28 23:08:25 Huh? I asked for proofs, not even more issues or accusations. By proofs, evidences that PRRD and the government, and not other factors, have been behind "inflation, killings, stocks down, etc." And please refrain from using unnecessarily derogatory terms.
2894 2018-09-28 23:07:48 @Denver4VA wants to further cut regulations on guns. Imagine August 12, 2017 with more guns and bump stocks. @LeslieCockburn is in favor of common sense gun reform.

2909 2018-09-28 22:52:43 But the thing is that Tesla is a public company, let's say a selected group knew about the tweet before it was tweeted, they could just sell stocks and buy them back at a lower price giving disadvantage to other investors (Don't get me wrong I'm a big Musk fan and follower!)

2918 2018-09-28 22:46:30 I recently bought one duplex, with the thought eventually it will go to one child.

Compared to stocks, and even bonds, the rent isn’t that great as an investment. Being a landlord is economically desirable only when the landlord gets to share in the appreciation that’s 1/
2919 2018-09-28 22:46:00 Honesty tho, I would not "invest" in housing or real estate anywhere around here for like 5-10 years. Stocks are way more controllable and better returns. Also building businesses.

Why are these companies justified in putting $100B valuation on stock (TLRY CEO's remark) but Tesla is unjustified in saying its shares are undervalued??
2929 2018-09-28 22:33:45 Stocks that have an almost cult time following. Maybe a few things linked to social media. Presence. Divergence of opinion. $tsla an obvious one, but has to be more than that $CULT for long $KULT for short version.

He stocks Owens fans so I had first assumed he was a danger zone loser but it looks like he's more of a true social justice Warrior who probably has tried to roofie a few women in his day but was overpowered by the 95-pound gals when he made his move
2935 2018-09-28 22:27:49 us stocks trading without permit

2937 2018-09-28 22:26:07 It’s really the best way to gain extra income aside from investing in stocks. I do it for a living and girl it’s the best thing ever
2938 2018-09-28 22:24:22 I don't take positions in any stocks where I may be tempted to prove a point, which is why i have not shorted Tesla or Westpac.  While I think my holdings are better than is being currently priced in, that's not a hill ill die on.
2939 2018-09-28 22:23:27 Never thought this day would come and so soon... Tesla stocks down while blackberry stocks up on the same day!!! #tesla #blackberry

2941 2018-09-28 22:22:19 As a trader, self reflection is important

I've been looking at my stuff from 2017. All the failed $SPX bearish signs came from:

1. Breadth divergences. With so many indicators, there will always be a "divergence"
2. Sentiment, which is better for forex & commodities, not stocks
2942 2018-09-28 22:22:01 i think most people does not really care to put a stake. In fact it is a nuisance for most people, at least for me. But don't take my word for it, i might be wrong. I don't even care about my voting rights in stocks I owned.
2943 2018-09-28 22:21:10 I'm thinking about skiping the open and start trading at mid day. Often i hit my max loss in the morning and then see the stocks fade and fucking cry

2962 2018-09-28 22:09:03 It’s like Twitter but for investors. It helps show you what stocks are hot

2964 2018-09-28 22:05:18 Sorry out of stocks already 

Yes official LS. 
2965 2018-09-28 22:05:03 Everyone yapping about the markets hitting new highs(&down) and how great they've been/they haven't done crap since mid-Jan other than a handful of stocks, hundreds of others get slammed repeatedly despite beating earnings/forecasts for 3Q at least, and are down or even/yr. Scam
2966 2018-09-28 22:04:45 Tomorrow marks the ten year anniversary of the largest point decline in the stock market to that point. September 2008 was a crazy time. #stocks #StockMarket #StockMarketCrash #stockstowatch #History #investing #financialcrisis

2970 2018-09-28 22:01:36 I miss shopping undies in the good old underwear shops, the stocks must have dropped low as your briefs when you get , hope fully your sox will soon be full again, you can never have to much underwear, to pull on and off xx 
2971 2018-09-28 22:00:56 Easy to pump stocks when the country prints money like there is no tomorrow..
2972 2018-09-28 22:00:37 Nationalism is not pride in your country it’s the denigration if other countries. All sounds very good.. take back control, fishing stocks, fact is it’s irrelevant if you suddenly have no one who you can sell fish to cheaply
2973 2018-09-28 22:00:18 Hard to say. 

With fuller data re: SARM candidate quickly approaching and expected to be positive, we could be in the lull b4 another move up. 

Either way, I am looking at the long term picture for $vktx -- imo, one of best risk/reward stocks available. Be patient with it.
2974 2018-09-28 22:00:06 WOOL SPECIAL ! Terra Firma wool now reduced while stocks last.
2975 2018-09-28 21:59:58 This is extreme case; but all the so called growth and value stocks are falling like nine pins. You know this better

2979 2018-09-28 21:55:24 Initial hysteria will push it way, way below its market value. Going to be amazing time to buy, for people who are into making money off of stocks.

2985 2018-09-28 21:52:46 I think Jalen Hudson is prob the player in my top 50 who does the best in eye test, as opposed to stats. Obv the shooting percentage is there but the guy is a legit athlete who can get to the rim and also a better defender than his stocks suggest.
2986 2018-09-28 21:52:13 Lmfao penny stocks for the win
2987 2018-09-28 21:52:00 bruh i hate a copy cat

2991 2018-09-28 21:47:45 There's apparently no need telling or urging the US to stop trading blames except if you want the Wall Street to shut down. Blame = losers mentality. But trading blames is the biggest on stocks...

2999 2018-09-28 21:42:07 I'd rather lose the stamina than the reversal stock, but as long as the ability to turn off reversal stocks, I could do that all I want. Cuz having limited reversals isn't exactly realistic anyway.

3072 2018-09-28 20:49:22 Everyone keeps yapping about the markets making new highs and how great they've been, they haven't done crap since mid-Jan other than a handful of stocks, hundreds of others get slammed repeatedly despite beating earnings and forecasts 3Q at least, and are down or even/yr. Scam
3073 2018-09-28 20:48:45 your targets for individual stocks like hdfc bank, indusind, kotak and also reliance all showing a corresponding NIFTY level of 9000 or below. Surprised why u think NIFTY can fall 10% but leading stocks fall 40-50% from here?

3087 2018-09-28 20:41:25 It's over. New fund starts on Monday (sans most of it's deeply undervalued mining positions) and likely replaced by overvalued broader market stocks. Bottom-ticking sales and top-ticking purchases? Classic!
3088 2018-09-28 20:41:14 The availability of stocks changes due to volume and liquidity.... so the stock could be treatable then not treatable... that doesn’t mean their shutting down penny stocks.... if there’s not an official statement from TradeNet then I wouldn’t worry about it... it’s just talk

3092 2018-09-28 20:37:01 #Stocks rose marginally today as #investors capped off a strong quarter. The #Dow rose 18 pts, and the S&P 500 and #Nasdaq both edged higher
3093 2018-09-28 20:36:58 They should give a notice about the date and time. Just like the earning report, either rise or fall, you take the bet. They know it’s gonna tank after the briefing, some big players already knew the news so they can dump the stocks.

3097 2018-09-28 20:32:30 where stocks? now that 1broker is ded?
3098 2018-09-28 20:32:04 In 2000 & 2008, the 1 & 2 yr $SPY EPS est trends diverged from price. By that, I mean overall earnings expectations were weakening, for an extended time, as price rose. That’s when stocks are in a bubble. Today, the 1 & 2 yr est trends are positive. 9 mth trend is negative though
3099 2018-09-28 20:31:19 there are retailer cult stocks, and you have to factor that in because a lot of the time a mass of retailers can make a stock act erratically and unpredictably, since retailers get emotional about their stocks and won't sell on bad news or buy hysterically on random pumps
3100 2018-09-28 20:30:53 The Stocks price action really makes you wonder if people knew ahead of time

3105 2018-09-28 20:28:07 always bull for long-term.  Stocks like AMD can go up 2000% in 3  years but can only go down 100%.
3106 2018-09-28 20:27:31 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $AMD, $SPGI. $MPC, $MCO, and $TWTR.

3130 2018-09-28 20:16:02 World stocks lower: Europe -.8%; US -.02%. Trade tension wil not go away. Neither will strong GDP & earnings-growth.

3169 2018-09-28 19:58:21 Once again, why is that their issue? Can you not find stocks of companies who don't fabricate things? It's harmful to investors in the aggregate to allow these types of leaders to run companies on the public markets.

In fact, it is not Jordans I want; I want Nike. 

You are not Nike, you are 2010 Jordans, I don't want Jordans.
3185 2018-09-28 19:51:26 Way too much FUD around 1broker. Let’s keep it super simple:

They were shut down because you could purchase stocks.

Could the SEC or CFTC go after other exchanges for different reasons? It’s possible. But they don’t deal with stocks, so for now it isn’t worth worrying about.
3186 2018-09-28 19:51:16 Pelosi & her @HouseDemocrats want YOU TO LOSE YOUR RETIREMENT.  Pelosi wants to crush businesses (again), so stocks fall in Price.

3361 2018-09-28 18:23:14 Tesla stocks dropped by 13% this morning due to the Elon Musk lawsuit that has been filed against him.
3362 2018-09-28 18:21:24 Yeah, but sometimes its not too bad. For example, most people can't afford to buy shares of Google. 

But choosing an ETF at least lets you invest in a piece of expensive stocks.
3363 2018-09-28 18:21:21 Just my opinion but I don't think that is the right strategy. Stocks falling have a common thread - high FII holding. So there can be stocks that are fundamentally very strong but FIIs are dumping and they are losing more compared to non FII stocks.

Step down as CEO and move to head of R&D or chief product engineer or something, in exchange, @SEC_Enforcement makes it a crime for short sellers to comment on stocks, since their only interest is in harming companies and actual investors.
3367 2018-09-28 18:18:57 Dumped you savings into stocks and investment and don’t turn back.
3368 2018-09-28 18:18:43 Your portfolio stocks which have handled the correction very well needs to be promoted and the ones which have disappointed u needs to be demoted.
This simple strategy will add few extra percentage points to your long term returns.

3373 2018-09-28 18:15:41 Good points-you won’t find many stagnant spec stocks with many 5-10+ yr investors.

There is room in a conservative model to position some funds for a big gain.

I think we found that JNJ didn’t prioritize Imet.  It’s not dead, will likely get +P3 in MDS and has great MF r/r MOS.
3374 2018-09-28 18:15:28 Bitcoin at $ 6650, as expected around this level. Stocks dropped beginning of this week as predicted. I remember when Litecoin was at $ 320 and I said to sell at this level, everyone thought it will go into the 1000s, it has disappointed ever since.

3376 2018-09-28 18:14:01 Just like the Great Depression!

3407 2018-09-28 17:53:15 #ooc I remember those days. Stocks are definitely a long-haul investment. Stick with them and usually you'll come out ahead over time, especially if you're investing in stocks with recognized growth potential.

It's legal for then to trade stocks from insider info.  They're probably trying to figure out how they can regulate it in a way that let's them continue to get rich while screwing everyone else.

3463 2018-09-28 17:32:39 You’d be surprised how lean inventory is typically kept. From my experience, Intel, for example, stocks the channel with 2-3 weeks of inventory on most volume SKUs. This is hardly a blessing for the pc component industry.  -LS

3466 2018-09-28 17:29:41 Italian Stocks Crash Most In 2 Years
 
Traders dumped Italian assets en masse, as Italian equities, bank stocks and bonds all tumbled in unison as deputy premier Matteo Salvini vowed to "press ahead" with a budget plan that puts Italy on "collision course" with Europe.

When markets will trade near bottom, the num of F&O stocks will get reduced to 100-150 again.

3481 2018-09-28 17:20:54 It would be very challenging to collect the wheat stocks by class. This would put a significant burden on respondents and would be very difficult for some to provide. It has been discussed over time. #StatChat LH

3493 2018-09-28 17:17:46 I feel exactly the same. Dan convinced me, and many others, to look into MJ stocks, and I couldn't be happier!
3494 2018-09-28 17:17:42 Jessy...good chart but the exploration costs underestimate the cost per oz to production (by a wide margin). This means M&A is much cheaper than exploration through to production decision cost per oz. Conclusion is mining stocks are cheaper than everyone believes.
3495 2018-09-28 17:17:03 is there any discussion at NASS about breaking out the quarterly wheat stocks data by class? #statchat
3496 2018-09-28 17:15:40 Yes because of ASM only many stocks are still trading at good price otherwise -----
3497 2018-09-28 17:15:37 Buy at what level . At least need 2 trading session uptrend. Profit will be less , but that will ensure minimal loss
3498 2018-09-28 17:15:23 Tesla holding 270 shows that some big fund who are interested in EV space could be buying the stocks right Now. Looking at Munro & german Engineers report 30K COGS on 10K/week rate looks like double digit profit for tesla. Next week 60K Model 3 could push tesla above 300.

3507 2018-09-28 17:09:10 if the stocks on the general list thus "shorted" went up in price and the corporation was compelled to go into the market later and "cover" at a great loss, ... losses sustained, greater profits which made in the "house" stocks, which share in the general upswing. #GGRadventures

I do wish that you had not been forced (by your employer I guess) to stop the service you temporarily ran of recommending stocks.  It was great and would have been awesome.
3527 2018-09-28 17:04:39 Stocks in fine, imo. Cryptopia would certainly be a good add for them. Listings on exchanges, at least from my perspective, doesn't mean much for price and isn't much of an indicator. But that's just my opinion.

3537 2018-09-28 17:00:49 I had family members that studied and business and finance in college. I feel they think that stocks is the secret to the rich and will make them money. I think big business owners are top ones to the be rich and wealthy quick.

3548 2018-09-28 16:54:32 The support for indexing is not that stocks "random" or that fund mgrs are no good at picking stocks. One must hope as indexer that stock values advance and that prices follow. That is the analytical foundation for long-term index investing, IMO. Backward-looking analysis? No.

3552 2018-09-28 16:53:46 A few ‘ifs” and “buts” tho. How many have stuck to stocks since Feb/March 09? How many stayed in Cash ? How many believed the doomsayers the last 9 and a half yrs ? Etc. Etc. Why is there so much still in Cash?
3553 2018-09-28 16:53:27 still looking for a breakout above the May highs in US Interest Rates. I think we could see a rally spark towards 4% that would send bonds tumbling. I also think that scenario would be bullish for both stocks & commodities $TNX $SPX $CRB $USO $GLD

3563 2018-09-28 16:50:00 So you think news affects market trends?
Try plotting dates of some major news events on your #trading charts.
What do you see?
Volatility, but no trend change?
Don't get distracted with #Crypto #forex or #stocks news. 
Focus on what the chart is telling you.
3564 2018-09-28 16:48:53 Dear Varinder. Today u r saying no one created wealth by buying when everyone was only buying . Why didn't u say the same when everyone was buying . Infact u switched to SME when SME was on its peak . We all know where SME stocks trade today .
3565 2018-09-28 16:48:49 Wall Street is not legit it's very controlled by the big investors. The rises and falls of the market depends on their buying and selling large amounts of stocks. Their "advisors" guy and sell and this affects severely the small investor or your 401Ks.
3566 2018-09-28 16:48:48 If a girl I wanted to date actually said "yes".. suddenly she didnt feel like such a big deal anymore.

3575 2018-09-28 16:44:54 Nice. I have a buy target of 370p, but out all day so not sure how close it came to that. Given today's drop I will place a cheeky limit order for next week.

After 12+ years in the #Markets, it is still extremely scary EVERY time u see stocks fall 20-40-60% in a flash! 

Only u KNOW, for sure, that this TOO shall pass. 

All stocks with big falls don't recover. U just pick up the pieces & move to the survivor stocks.
3588 2018-09-28 16:38:55 Most safe stocks go up at least 50% a year so how do ppl fuck up? Getting to risky?

3618 2018-09-28 16:28:17 USDA Stocks report is released with 2.14 corn vs. 2.01 est.  Beans 438 vs. 401 and wheat 2.38 vs. 2.34.  This confirms my thoughts the yearly lows may have been made in corn and wheat.  Look to re-own unpriced grain w/futures or options rather than paying the high DP costs.
3619 2018-09-28 16:28:14 Until women use their very powerful money influence no man will pay attention. “Voices” don’t matter. Use the power of money. Stop putting $ where men need it, stocks, consumerism, donations, pressure employers and companies to do same. When$ talks- men listen.
3620 2018-09-28 16:28:04 Possible, but unlikely. 1broker had us markets (stocks, indices, forex), I think that's why they were targeted.  These exchanges should not touch USD markets. but when decentralized exchanges arrive, it wont matter.
3621 2018-09-28 16:27:57 Defense stocks are a strong buy & look unbeatable under the Trump admin.

3630 2018-09-28 16:22:27 People who come to business channels and casually talk about investing in chor companies should be ashamed of their irresponsibility as innocent retail investors for whom those ideas are directed may have lost all their wealth and will never come back to stocks.
3631 2018-09-28 16:22:22 You are intentionally conflating the two. When you say "the Economy", you are talking about how rich people are doing(stocks,corporate profits,tax cuts for the Rich)
The "Americans" you mention have had flat wages for decades while corporate profits have soared.
But you KNOW that
3632 2018-09-28 16:22:03 Because those stocks which performed well are shifted to mid-cap or large cap.
3633 2018-09-28 16:21:58 Stocks are the highest they've ever been, unemploymentis at the lowest numbers ever, the economy is booming, people. Ever wonder why the left doesn't support that? It's because they don't support America. #republican #democrats #MAGA

3640 2018-09-28 16:20:07 Chris, with all due respect, Tesla can raise 500 million dollars in one single press release. The market cap is 47 billion. They can raise 10% of market cap at a 5% discount and the deal will be oversubscribed.  It’s the 2 dollar stocks that can’t raise $, not the 270 ones.

3662 2018-09-28 16:13:17 USDA revised 2017/18 soy production upward by 19 million bushels (trade was looking for a slight cut). The soybean production changes has historically caused much of the analyst miss in the Sept. 1 stocks. Great example right here.

3699 2018-09-28 16:05:53 But I do believe that house loan installment is another shape of saving. Seriously. Housing rate annual increment is above inflation. Then yes, just like buying bonds or stocks, buying a house is same as saving, well, investing to be exact.
3700 2018-09-28 16:05:40 Rating agency stocks S&P Global $SPGI and Moody's $MCO are trading down on rising rates. This is a knee-jerk reaction and previously has been wrong. We own $SPGI and are considering adding on further weakness as it has a modest valuation, growth, pricing power in a duopoly.

When the masses come into crypto investing, are they going to be using BTC as a gateway? Nope. Stable coin will be their go to. I don't turn my USD into Bitcoin before I buy stocks. Why would I do it before I buy other assets?

3766 2018-09-28 15:48:53 As much as $GTBIF seems to buck the larger market trends and even the #PotStocks to some degree too (it's management & strategy is a little unique even in this space) it does still act as most stocks do when all variables are weighed against its still largely speculative nature

3826 2018-09-28 15:33:07 I've never understood shorts sticking with their short bets on stocks prices when there is no market cap left. Its effectively selling people options without decay. What could go wrong?
3827 2018-09-28 15:33:00 Exactly. Like people around the world were wondering who exo was and SM really passed up the opportunity for exo to get even bigger. And now they think making us wait is all giggles and shit but once their stocks start dropping....

4212 2018-09-28 13:03:56 My practical 2c in value style investing: invest where there is an upcoming catalyst to realise value and use a time stop. Buying cheap stocks indiscriminately is like a long volatility strategy, you will bleed in opp cost and market risk but occasionally look like a genius
4213 2018-09-28 13:03:33 Are any of my AIM stocks going to realise their value after huge fundamental growth in the business.

4216 2018-09-28 13:02:54 Quality of business is already reflected in ROE and operating margin which are causing higher earnings. Paying 60 times earnings to those businesses is overpaying. Stocks will lag earnings growth in next decade

4223 2018-09-28 13:00:39 October has a reputation for stock market crashes, albeit they are rare and can happen at any time. What are the odds of a crash this October? I'd say  25% and, though that means there's a 75% chance one WON'T happen, 25% is a VERY SCARY number. Be sophisticated! #stocks #markets
4224 2018-09-28 12:59:54 True. Only have 4 different at present so stocks are running low! Favourite is the #crownjewel from @BeefeaterGin on my 3rd litre now....

4249 2018-09-28 12:43:59 When global stocks reverse in Q4 or early 2019, housing prices will likely experience a brief deflationary period, but I would buy those lows ahead of a reversal of global central bank policies to #QE on steroids, crushing bond yields and mortgage rates and pushing prices higher.
4250 2018-09-28 12:43:41 When stocks from strong companies plunge it makes the people behind the scenes happy. You see, we little people who sponge up the news "as is" sell because we learned about it pouring our coffee... Then the big boys buy up the shares for a lower price. WAKE UP PEEPS!

4264 2018-09-28 12:38:12 The official Italian budget produced a deficit of 2.4% of GDP, larger than hoped by markets. The euro extended its loses from Thursday and German bund yields declined following the announcement.  What this means for stocks.

4296 2018-09-28 12:20:43 I've never liked shorting stocks. 1st, the most you can make from shorting is 100% - you can make way more by buying long. 2nd, good luck trying to make that 100% - when a company starts dying it flays around for years, and 99% of the time it gets acquired so it never goes to 0.

4330 2018-09-28 12:01:16 But entry and exit will be key in making profit in these stocks. VWAP will be very handy to pick the entry

4341 2018-09-28 11:54:54 Italian banks giving us a chance to mangia on some stocks this morning ..seems way overdone when looking at an Italian economy on the mend and a populist govt that ultimately wants to do business and right by the country...#italybudget @matteosalvinimi
4342 2018-09-28 11:54:42 How are you dealing with this crash sir @VijayKedia1 advice for people who r 100% invested and to people who cloned your stocks. Time to average or just hold till 2020?
4343 2018-09-28 11:54:34 "May change" - well, yes it certainly "may". But you'll go from a "trader" to a "chaser" in the blink of an eye. I don't take advice from twitter "guru's". You have an agenda no matter what you say. Spend you time pumping the PRED and we'll root for our stocks. May the best win.

And are screaming buys, provided you have a 2-year horizon.

4589 2018-09-28 09:17:54 and yet ppl are fawning over colin kaepernick, who said some dumb ass shit he heard about hillary, and did not even register to vote.  he kneel'd, then crapped all over those who bled and died for his vote.  now he's a hero, nike stocks are through the roof, and we are forgotten,
4590 2018-09-28 09:17:27 Valid point Agreed.. Only reason i put Banknifty there was that despite the volatility it does not move like the stocks and monthly expiry are still reasonably ok. For whatever its worth i don't do Banknifty 
4591 2018-09-28 09:16:35 Small accounts can do only trades in Nifty alone.. If going to trade in stocks always protect downside and play.. Reduce position sizing.. Stay safe,,,
4592 2018-09-28 09:16:06 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder

Inspired by conversation with my friend regarding valuations of some stocks few minutes back.
4595 2018-09-28 09:15:09 Ok I will do :) thank you for your feedback.
4596 2018-09-28 09:14:59 #Midcaps Stocks cracked  and  worst month since Oct 2008.
4597 2018-09-28 09:14:12 good fundamental stocks r gtng beat down in turmoil & hidden skeletons r coming out so its very shaky situation 4 already beaten down Companies like hdil. D thing dry have working 4 them is no fno and 5 % limit or else I'm sure in last 5 session it would have reached 15 
4598 2018-09-28 09:13:58 I Am A Star is now in search of another Group 1 win after her dominant win in the Stocks Stakes @TheValley.

She won the Myer Classic as a three year old in 2016. Can she be the first mare to win the feature race twice?

She is now the favourite.
4599 2018-09-28 09:13:57 @ashish_kacholia  Sir How do you feel and cope with it? When you see your stocks falling 40-50% from your purchase price
4600 2018-09-28 09:13:48 PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE stocks slump
4601 2018-09-28 09:13:26 Special treatment, starting at 15 yards, while stocks last

4603 2018-09-28 09:11:49 I’d be there if my own show wasn’t on. Best of luck to a great team!
4604 2018-09-28 09:11:15 Now you can see lots of collateral damage happening to good stocks too due to massive correction in other areas. People have to sell what they can sell to make up for the losses elsewhere.
4605 2018-09-28 09:09:44 Any fresh views after seeing the stocks tumble today ......?
4606 2018-09-28 09:08:25 Positional Call ITC sell CMP 292.60 Target 289, 281,275 ? #NIFTY #BANKNIFTY #STOCKS #NIFTY50 SL 300
4607 2018-09-28 09:08:11 $SNAP you can tell who has invested beforeee, when else r u supposed to
buy??? stocks do not perpetually up
4608 2018-09-28 09:08:06 BN and NBFCs have just corrected their over valuations. 4-5% correction in Nifty is absolutely normal. Stocks like Infibeam are collateral damage. My only worry is the shallow market. Open the quote window of Nifty and the total best 5 buyers or 5 sellers are not more than 3000
4609 2018-09-28 09:07:20 Agree . The way some stocks are falling ( and not just talking about the obvious ones ) is like 2008
4610 2018-09-28 09:06:34 Could the recent increase in SPAN margins have increased volatility ? I feel like stocks are dropping like flies.
4611 2018-09-28 09:06:30 Luckily my previous boss gave me a shooting job not a editing.

4612 2018-09-28 09:06:26 She sure is a star! I AM A STAR (I Am Invincible) makes it back-to-back Stakes wins, easily claiming the G2 Stocks Stakes @TheValley for @shanenicholsrac @MatthewSandblom @BMelham. She's a $40k #InglisClassic buy for @jmeharron from Broadwater TBs. Now won almost $1.5m!

4618 2018-09-28 09:05:00 Meltdown has now spread to midcap tech stocks as well. Nothing is safe anymore.
4619 2018-09-28 09:04:30 If you are a value investor and not a trader you should welcome this. So many stocks at great valuation.Remember the underlying businesses are hardly impacted.Look at Maruti. 25% correction. You think sales or profit decreases by that amount?
4620 2018-09-28 09:04:09 thanksss ,,, hope it will overcome soon ,,, many stocks not in value ,,,,,,

4624 2018-09-28 09:02:30 Hi Tom, thanks for taking the time to come back to me. I appreciate that you’ve had balanced panels in the past, but can I suggest that if you could easily find several male professionals & not one female, maybe you could take some time to expand your network of female creatives?
4625 2018-09-28 09:02:12 Only index. Stocks strictly NO.
4626 2018-09-28 09:01:08 Now imagine being able to buy cannabis stocks with crypto, or any stocks for that matter. Now that is a world I wish to be in, win win situation. Markets need to move with the times, now is the time, crypto time ! 
4627 2018-09-28 09:00:57 One lesson newbies like us need to learn is we should book profit and move to other stocks that still has value. People sit when stock prices move beuond valuation hoping it will raise further. Instead sell and find value else where. I bought HDFc.On cons basis it's now Value
4628 2018-09-28 09:00:21 What a day to tweet this !! steel stocks meltdown
4629 2018-09-28 08:58:50 Newbie #traders usually like to buy the bottoms in current market scenario but they soon realize that falling stocks keep falling more & stocks which are strong & outperforming are the ones which seem to be overbought & expensive.
4630 2018-09-28 08:58:46 @sahneydeepak sir views on yes bank and Edelweiss??? I have been holding both of the stocks for long time.. I have a long term view.
4631 2018-09-28 08:58:36 Midcap, Small Caps, Micro Caps cracking down heavily......

The Stocks that have nothing wrong or negative and are rather posting good results have been beaten down too....

Let's see when will the strong Companies in Midcap, Small Caps, Micro Caps give a strong bounce back

4634 2018-09-28 08:56:16 People were screaming - Don't worry nothing will happen to Pharma stocks back in 2015-early 2016. What happened - enormous price damage and long-term time correction. Never fight against tide especially when it's over-owned. Even minor adjustment leads to brutal price correction
4635 2018-09-28 08:55:57 Bank stocks have fallen - quite dramatically. NAB is down by more than 20% - tens of billions of dollars wiped out.
4636 2018-09-28 08:55:23 So many stocks are bleeding today. Wow. That Infibeam is down 65 % in one day  no1 can time the market, market sabka baap. I was right about yes bank and jp asso as well. @prasanthgkumar

4643 2018-09-28 08:51:18 Stocks are sinking
4644 2018-09-28 08:51:12 So who is right? When stocks went high without basis of fundamentals then all was ok. When there is a mean reversion blame it on some one else? Markets need reasons to correct but every 2"3 years there is a 10% correction. Last one was 2015 Dec-2016 Feb. Before that 2010- 2013.

The key takeaway for others might be that 10 years out from these dates, stocks were still flat. We ought to look for other investments.

4724 2018-09-28 08:09:36 The biggest lesson for me so far has been to ignore the fancy stocks and also make sure you're adequately diversified. It's ok have 20 stocks.

4734 2018-09-28 07:56:23 You should have just listed these 5 stocks. I haven’t been around long enough to see that many stocks. In my short time all I’ve seen is 3. Out of 100, 97 have failed. Taking victims along for the ride. Until Cheeky-Charm asserted himself on social media lol. I learn off you all!
4735 2018-09-28 07:55:07 So disgusting to see nifty stocks fall like house of cards due to frauds.....RBI, SEBI and govt are always sitting ducks with no accountability at all....hadh hoti hai..retail investors ki vaat laga di
4736 2018-09-28 07:53:26 Most of your calls are fake shorts lol. You conveniently seem to miss all the long trades on these stocks which you could actually trade for real and instead focus on calling tops.

4741 2018-09-28 07:49:32 And be careful. If those ideologues hear you repeating the suggestion that trans women and cis women might possibly be different, you'll be in the stocks with the rest of us.
4742 2018-09-28 07:49:25 DHFL = Span ( 48.8%) + Exp Margin (8%) = 56.8%
YESBANK =  Span ( 28.2%) + Exp Margin (5%) = 33.2%

Those who are averaging these stocks on every fall need to understand margins can further increase due to volatility. So you need to keep funds both for MTM + increasing margins
4743 2018-09-28 07:48:29 For the full details of this, and much much more, read the best selling book 'Enemy of the State' available from Amazon UK while stocks last.

4748 2018-09-28 07:43:59 #Markets There seems to be an eerie sinister silence of the Govt.despite the market fall to this level. Make no mistake this is reminiscent of the bear markets of #2008. The Index has been managed by the bears. Most stocks are down more than 50% in 2 months.

4763 2018-09-28 07:36:34 If it’s about individual stocks then the agenda is clear.

If it’s about their “journey” then it’s more about ego and self-promotion. The latter of course can give posts on individual stocks more weight. 

Nothing wrong with it, but it’s often incorrectly dressed up as selfless.

5000 2018-09-28 04:30:43 The issues is that they are trading US markets, accepting US customers, and allowing US customers to buy these stocks, and essentially circumvent US laws and regulations. If they have banned US citizens this may not have happened.

5194 2018-09-28 02:18:09 RT tferriss | RT pessala: LennyIce BrentBeshore Public stocks look less expensive recently because new tax rules have padded the corporate earnings (and thus the PE figures). Howard Marks HowardMarksBook explains this really well on his recent podcast interview with tferriss …

5202 2018-09-28 02:12:45 nung last na nagtanong ako 2 days ago sabi 2-3 stocks. so minus inorder ko so probably 1-2 na lang.
5203 2018-09-28 02:11:17 Absolutely not, while many exchanges will come under scrutiny and be compelled to change some things, 1broker was allowing trading of traditional securities, stocks derivatives etc with zero kyc.  Using btc as the other side of the swap.  Not similar to binance etc
5204 2018-09-28 02:11:17 Great call on this one.  Stocks and options.  
5205 2018-09-28 02:11:06 Yes and no. If you have a bag of cash under your bed sure. But who does that?
More likely if you have some money saved you'll have it in a bank earning interest which offsets the inflation.
If you have more you may start to invest in assets like bonds, stocks, property etc.
5206 2018-09-28 02:10:56 Please save your money and invest in stocks. Political waves come and go, but financial security is a safety blanket for your family.

5213 2018-09-28 02:06:19 The fact that a new trader has access to the same stocks, same prices, same potential profit. What they don’t see is all the work it took to get to be consistently profitable. I’m past the shiny object phase but still in the consistency phase. Gotta keep puttin in work!

5216 2018-09-28 02:05:11 That one might not be bad but if you look most of them follow the exact trend of BTC. I'd just be careful and not get too wild. At this point you might be better investing in real stocks haha

5221 2018-09-28 02:03:48 Agreed. Good news almost every day this week for Uranium industry, And each day one reactor years worth of fuel gets consumed in the worlds reactors and that number is accelerating. I am still in awe that stocks are still so cheap but that will not last too long.
5222 2018-09-28 02:03:25 highschool is a sham. if you graduate telling yourself “man i wish i was able to do more in these four years”, just like they claim you’ll be doing, then ur just not doing enough with your life. invest in stocks, build a birdhouse, gamble, go get that degree you’ve dreamt about
5223 2018-09-28 02:02:53 You are promoting OTC counter stocks on your tweets.  I try to be civil but concerned citizens like yourself always show their true colors lol.

5225 2018-09-28 02:00:57 I'll never understand people like you. People have been shorting stocks for ages. Shorts aren't this company's problem. A CEO who can't stay off Twitter and make good decisions for the company is its problem.

5227 2018-09-28 01:59:27 Can anyone think of any reason these sleeze democrats/SOCIALISTS should report to work any further?
Can anyone find a spoonful of integrity or decency among them?

They should be put in stocks,  that's the old time handcuffs for head and hands, and pelted with crap.

Disgusting
5228 2018-09-28 01:59:20 We're almost halfway through the traditionally scary share market season of September-October and no sign of trouble yet. Aussie shares are down about 2% for the month after slumping early, but US stocks are still climbing. Dow Jones index up 1.6% so far for September.
5229 2018-09-28 01:57:02 Totally agree. I discussed this one podcast. Traditional stocks may switch to crypto tokens and restructure the financial markets. Seems crazy but if Tesla stock gets taken down by a tweet I could see things moving that way.
5230 2018-09-28 01:53:29 They'll never give us any money back...On the Chappelle Show episode with da reperations and da sister say "hide the money" she really saying black man & women keep your money in ya community cause you are the largest consumer...seconds later Cadillac stocks was thru da roof. 
5231 2018-09-28 01:52:08 Thinking about getting into stocks 
5232 2018-09-28 01:51:01 Totally. It’s sort of like printing it on different stocks or printers. 

You’ve also reminded me that I have several hundred frames to review from my last session. I guess I know what I’m up to this weekend : )

5242 2018-09-28 01:45:06 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren

5245 2018-09-28 01:43:56 wrong, stocks do go to zero.  Especially if you keeps idiots like Standley around. S/h/b fired long ago.

5247 2018-09-28 01:43:24 Nobody knows for sure that the Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
5248 2018-09-28 01:43:10 Invest in stocks that on average pay out a 5%-10% annual dividend and live off that.

5256 2018-09-28 01:37:48 A payday reminder:

To avoid spending your money quickly, convert it into shares of stocks of a mutual fund or individual companies. What you can't see you can't spend.

#invest #mutualfunds #stockmarket
5257 2018-09-28 01:37:48 Yes, stocks go up and down.  Many shorts will wait till it hits all time highs, then short. When it goes down, then they cover for profit.  If it moves against them, they either double down or exit.

5259 2018-09-28 01:35:00 And when corporations get tax breaks who do you think ends of paying those taxes? 

The tax breaks the corps. got were supposed to result in higher wages. When are they going to stop paying off debt and buying back stocks (the #1 and #2 use of corporate tax cuts) and raise wages?

5267 2018-09-28 01:31:10 Fiat Currencies are instruments of debt- only an asset in that you own someone else’s debt when you have fiat. Fiat is distributed electronically now- direct deposit, stocks “bought” online. It’s all a promissory note on an “I.O.U.”
5268 2018-09-28 01:30:01 I am Bearish on this way overvalued stock.   shorts have no advantage over longs.  Stocks have a long bias in the long term.   Shorting is so much riskier than going long.

5289 2018-09-28 01:13:58 The quote was down, which is ridiculously meaningless of course during a halt. A CSE thing, I guess. Stocks like $XTHC and $BUDD have been halted for weeks, yet people keep putting in orders for no logical reason, affecting my P/L daily (I own both).

5322 2018-09-28 00:42:41 @PaigeCockburn Aren't ASX100 and ASX200 just lists of stocks in an index.  Dr Ferguson may be a director of some of those companies but unless there is a board governing those two indexes it's not valid to say she has "experience on the ASX100 and ASX200 boards".  Remove "the".

5324 2018-09-28 00:42:40 It happens to all of us. We do all we can to make winning bets, but much can’t be predicted or controlled. Why I like to spread my bets between 8-12 stocks. You’ll pick another runner soon.

5326 2018-09-28 00:41:04 @elonmusk you’ve made the #tsla stock like that of pot stocks or cryptos. This ride has been the scariest and uneasiest because of all your shenanigans. What the fuck did you have to tweet for fool? Do us a favor & don’t take your phone to the shitter from here on out. Will you?
5327 2018-09-28 00:41:03 Dear sir , pls also include on ur column that whether it’s positive or negative for stocks

5330 2018-09-28 00:38:23 Lucky. $tsla is one of the best stocks to trade options on. Moves fast and often just have to be on the right side of the news. Puts holders could bank 20000% + at market open
5331 2018-09-28 00:38:11 frightens me a bit how many of the same stocks we end up owning.
5332 2018-09-28 00:38:09 Who determines what the (subjective) red flags are? Banning bump stocks won’t do shit to stop a mentally ill person from murdering people. Criminals will do what they do despite law so this is really pointless. Stop trying to take away our #secondamendment right.

5345 2018-09-28 00:31:08 I suspect insider trading between different tickers in this group of pot stocks. Why the shroud of secrecy and shared crap photos that take weeks to produce?
5346 2018-09-28 00:30:12 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

5347 2018-09-28 00:29:46 It's hard to understand why $BABA hasn't rocketed by 1000% since its IPO. A majority of the Chinese Fin Tech stocks has under-performed.
5348 2018-09-28 00:29:01 Studying stocks is confusing
5349 2018-09-28 00:28:12 What really ?
5350 2018-09-28 00:26:29 Always gotta keep a demo account when you're  trading stocks, forex, and crypto 
5351 2018-09-28 00:24:52 Yes in a sense, yes. Not tangible and trade able nor able to make stocks with, but it is how someone gets in the door for things.
5352 2018-09-28 00:24:29 Both my biotech stocks ate shit today! Huzzah!
5353 2018-09-28 00:24:26 It's really tiring. For a couple weeks, I woke up at 6:30am (cuz that's when markets open in my time zone) to follow stocks but I just got too tired. Been holding Apple for 2 years and never got a dividend but it has done well for me

5355 2018-09-28 00:20:45 @SenFeinstein Either you or your staff leaked the confidential doc. A violation of Senate Rule XXVIIII (5). You know the drill. Own up to it and resign or find the staffer and present him/her to the Senate for Contempt and whatever other charges there may be.

5357 2018-09-28 00:18:03 Elon Musk thought he was gonna skate. I know very little about stocks and trading but what he did, when talking through it to myself, sounds illegal as HELL.
5358 2018-09-28 00:16:03 Yeayy!! Finally.. thanks for the pic dear

5360 2018-09-28 00:14:57 I'm pretty sure that the market is doing so well  is because booze stocks are going thru the roof.
5361 2018-09-28 00:14:37 Ye. It's not "real", but I'm using it for when I actually have money to trade stocks in the future; I want to practice & learn the tricks of the trade. No pun intended
5362 2018-09-28 00:14:27 Where do these lunatics think these buffer stocks will be held?  Who has the shelf space for stockpiling?  Why would they build rent lease light heat the huge volumes needed?

5366 2018-09-28 00:11:59 Bitcoin is just as wonderful at $6,000 as it is at $7,000. It is not directly comparable to other types of asset classes, such as sovereign currencies and stocks.

5372 2018-09-28 00:08:29 i have stocks ..and it depends on what’s the person’s goal..are they the trading/high risk type or are they the investing type.. ultimately the goal is to make money from companies that shows growth..profit is important because dividends paid to shareholders comes from that
5373 2018-09-28 00:06:46 highly recommend fuckin around and buying stocks

buy some good companies, follow some volatile ones so that u know when they're undervalued

also, dont be afraid to trade cryptos. idk about HODL. BUT you can easily make 25% in a lucky day of crypto buy/sell.
5374 2018-09-28 00:06:31 I know those stocks are about to tank
5375 2018-09-28 00:06:27 Do you actually have stocks? i dont believe it
5376 2018-09-28 00:05:53 Did we forget the part where she screeched "What difference does it make"?
5377 2018-09-28 00:05:06 Could there really be that much retail money in these stocks?  Most "retail investors" of stock twits living in Mom's basement

5381 2018-09-28 00:01:52 Nat gas stocks had themselves a day today. While there are nonbelievers in the bull case for oil, it's tough to make a bearish case for natgas. Position in $CR and may buy another if we pull back.
5382 2018-09-28 00:00:58 stan twitter who doesnt buy company stocks/do stock trading should not act like they know how it works and what motivates people from buying them 
5383 2018-09-28 00:00:43 @FeralDog pretty sad when my toilet paper stocks and garbage services stocks do better than my biotech stocks. Just sayin.
