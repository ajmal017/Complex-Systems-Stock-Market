1 2019-03-03 23:59:48 The silver crystals in the emulsion of film stocks would not burn fast enough, reason why early photography required you to stay still for minutes at a time to capture an image. In the early 20th century, things improved in that those crystals would burn much faster...

8 2019-03-03 23:56:32 FFS- you are mixing color reproduction standards with dynamic range and exposure. 

Early film stocks (late 19th century to early 20th) had poor dynamic range and you could really only expose correctly the brightest part of the image or the darkest one.

30 2019-03-01 23:45:57 Apparently, @regrock29 thinks that when ATF’s technology chief John Spencer is asked whether bump stocks are legal in 2010 and he basically says "Yeah, they're not illegal", that means Obama hands out bump stocks like candy.
