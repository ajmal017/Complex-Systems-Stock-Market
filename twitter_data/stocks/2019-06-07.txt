18 2019-06-09 23:59:32 No, the wealthy do not create jobs with their wealth.  They do not spend it - it gets invested in stocks, bonds and buying companies and other investment vehicles that earn more money for them.  Those do not create jobs.
19 2019-06-09 23:58:32 Private prison stocks up 100% since Trump's win.

29 2019-06-09 23:51:26 I’m not even sure that Thybulle is a top 5 defender in this draft class, let alone a “lock down defender” at the next level. His role in the zone inflated his stocks, and I’m not sold that it all translates. Drafting him over Grant Williams is beyond my comprehension.

34 2019-06-09 23:48:54 Thanks, that makes sense - yours is a different perspective and a better way of communicating.

$TSLAQ "we" have too much focus on numbers. Who cares how many cars sold in Q2 '19?

Shorting stocks drives people a little crazy :) 

This story has an unhappy ending :(

36 2019-06-09 23:48:32 Chris does great work and manages client funds...he is an objective guy, no biases! For my part, nowadays I just invest my personal capital in a concentrated portfolio of growth stocks and hedge using a systematic strategy.
37 2019-06-07 23:59:20 You have to find a better job or work 2. Pay bills w/ one & invest w/ the other. I didn’t start stock investing until I was 40 and by dollar cost averaging in the S&P500 among buying a few stocks that I know( services& products you use) I was able to retire by 60. Discipline!

44 2019-06-07 23:53:11 Yes as the owner of the business you work for earns money in the market (even if it just through the company's stocks going up, the owner can either pay you more or hire more ppl. Capitalism. Every one benefits.

56 2019-06-07 23:46:21 What should we exchange BTC for?

I'll trade it if / when I need inflation free money towards a house, or I have to diversify assets out of crypto (due to portfolio weight) either to stocks or bonds or real estate.

It exchanges very well for cash, which I use to pay CC bills.
