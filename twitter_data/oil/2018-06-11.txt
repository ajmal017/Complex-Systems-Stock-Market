13 2018-06-11 23:58:32 Pres Trump, if the FF attack re Syria is coming again, realize that Assad is not using chemicals on the ppl he is trying to liberate. It makes no sense. What does make sense is the psycho globalists still want war, still want oil, still want Assad out, and are still lying!

47 2018-06-11 23:56:29 Bull the EU is so feckless they could not put together a peace treaty, so they criticize Trump. EU is too lazy and entrenched with status quo, as they gobble up Iranian oil.

57 2018-06-11 23:54:21 Try ibuprofens over aspirins. CBD oil products are also amazing pain killers. Drink some water/ have a snack too it’ll also help your headache. Things get bad sometimes but there’s gotta be something that distracts you or makes you feel better that can help pull you up a little

63 2018-06-11 23:53:04 Stop painting your nails put oil I’m not sure what specific oil but google that shit. Those manis r kinda harmful because they file on the surface of the nail so the polish could adhere better
64 2018-06-11 23:52:45 Completely agree. Waiting for this genie to mature out of the bottle: too little, too late. This would have been a great idea in 1962.
A trademark of Prof David Keith’s work, since UCalgary days: work in area between decisive, quick action on climate change, and the oil biz.

78 2018-06-11 23:49:58 So strange. I love seeing the large wind turbines across the landscape when I drive though Iowa. I think they would be fine. Sooo much nicer looking and better for the environment than off shore oil rigs.

Norway, for example, has an Oil Fund worth £Trillions. UK spent ours
84 2018-06-11 23:49:21 Where is Big Oil in all this? The already high pump prices keep going up since BIG OIL received LOWER corporate tax rates which is incurred by taxpayers. No mention of lower pump prices, just continue to raise!Now at over $3.25 gal fuel & $3.50 diesel, await next storm&price jump

92 2018-06-11 23:48:34 Yes ...kinda

They paused their program in exchange for economic assistance (money, sometimes in the form of oil) under a deal done by Clinton

That deal was scrapped by Bush at the urging of John Bolton so they restarted their program and now have Nukes

So there we go
93 2018-06-11 23:48:21 Agreed. in addition, pompeo said today, "all other presidents have been fooled by NK deals ..not trump." That is BS and a lie. In '94 clinton made a deal for NK to dismantle (which they were)in exchange for oil deliveries. congressional republicans were outraged a voted against

95 2018-06-11 23:48:13 And 7 rail cars derailed today carrying oil. A DOT 111 tanker holds 717bbl of oil. Making it an equivalent of 4,990 bbl

105 2018-06-11 23:46:44 This British Oil and gas deal the UK had with LRC, is a disgrace to the British people of good conscience. When the government closes their eyes from a genocide of their making, and turning around to blame Trump. They should be ashamed.

117 2018-06-11 23:45:28 Projected oil dividends for 2019-20 and 2020-21 are $448 M and $467 M. This would be the oil revenue I would use to mitigate electricity prices. Presently, dividends are zero.

128 2018-06-11 23:43:27 This devaluation does not help Pakistan because the economy is no export oriented, nor have the previous government's policy  been helpful for exports. All that devaluation does is increase the price of imports,oil etc which has a drastic effect on inflation

133 2018-06-11 23:42:23 That's great! I don't think you should have to have been 180000 in debt to get a degree or have to work 60 hours unless you want to though. I think you should get bigger tax cuts. Not the billionaires and billion dollar corporations and oil companies. They should have to pay way

138 2018-06-11 23:41:56 I add it before roasting when I toss the vegetables in the olive oil. I don’t want the scent to be too strong, just a hint of it.

145 2018-06-11 23:40:53 In other words, you chose big oil, factories and corporations over workers, right?
146 2018-06-11 23:40:26 It's a great day for Meadow Sense. Molly Stewart just earned her Essential Oil Specialist Certification from Aromahead Institute, School of Essential Oil Studies! — celebrating success
147 2018-06-11 23:40:24 It’s very silly that “grilled chicken” has become synonymous with “unseasoned boneless skinless chicken breast piece.” Cuz bone-in, skin-on chicken w/ olive oil, S+P on the grill is so delicious and easy.

151 2018-06-11 23:40:06 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

153 2018-06-11 23:39:34 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
154 2018-06-11 23:39:25 It's layers of phyllo dough, oil and meat and then baked.
155 2018-06-11 23:39:17 por acaso vcs ja escutaram o ep coconut oil? se n tiverem escutado escutem pq é MUITO bom
156 2018-06-11 23:38:46 Reconstitute them with oil, slice a gourmet hot dog (or sausage) in half, stuff the jalapenos in the middle (maybe with shredded cheese) and grill over direct heat.
157 2018-06-11 23:38:22 Thanks for the suggestion Brian. I've taken fish oil for heart health for years, more recently trying glucosamine, chondroitin, turmeric & MSM supplement.
158 2018-06-11 23:38:20 Confirm or deny: anything can be cooked in olive oil, lemon juice, and hot pepper flakes and will be 100x more delicious ???

The oil companies spend a lot to promote aliens
161 2018-06-11 23:38:07 I’m reluctant, tbh, because it has coconut oil and fragrance. My skin is hella sensitive. You had no reaction to it?
162 2018-06-11 23:37:51 We want their oil!
163 2018-06-11 23:37:49 Peppermint oil, preggy pops, sour candies
164 2018-06-11 23:37:47 Crude Oil formed two bullish tailed bars (reversal patterns) within the  65.50 – 63.80 support / buy zone we discussed in last week’s commentary,  moving slightly higher into the week’s end.
165 2018-06-11 23:37:47 Lactose free ≠ dairy-free :) But you’re definitely right, many margarines are vegetable oil.
166 2018-06-11 23:37:35 I do an avocado oil and some Rose water
167 2018-06-11 23:37:29 Mostly other oils like olive, black castor, and argan. The Aussie conditioner is really good too and the Ogx argan oil intense moisturing treatment.
168 2018-06-11 23:37:29 Argan oil edge control so trash son.
169 2018-06-11 23:37:28 Reminiscent of Charter Oil’s demise in the late 1970s with their loss of cheap Iranian oil.

171 2018-06-11 23:37:16 Canada is full of American owned Corporations! America is not full of Canadian owned Corporations! Americans oil Companies enjoy Canada's extremely low royalty rates! Cheep natural gas from Canada keep America's from freezing in the dark! U.S whats Canada's healthcare privatized!

173 2018-06-11 23:37:08 How are they ? I figure mike and Jeff would either be pretty good together or like oil and water.
174 2018-06-11 23:37:06 You threatened me! I made a copy. You have the Mooch following me! I have more. Like cyber plans, big oil, #Healthcare #FacebookAds etc... I am going to expose you and you will regret #LilFuckerTryingToKillDemocracy #TryMeIDareYou #BringItBitch!
175 2018-06-11 23:37:05 Wow you must have inhale a lot of gas to believe that we must promote oil, we're in 2018 we should use clean energy as much as possible!
176 2018-06-11 23:36:56 It's time to blow some cars and oil rigs up! #E32018 #GameReady
177 2018-06-11 23:36:40 Time for Canada to shut down oil,water,lumber,steel and aluminum.
178 2018-06-11 23:36:40 Give me a break.  Most people are too busy trying to stave off starvation for themselves and their families, to pay rent, to make sure they get the oil changed, to put kids through school to spend their waking lives looking for a fight.
179 2018-06-11 23:36:39 互いに頑張りましょ（お腹がいたい）

182 2018-06-11 23:36:25 Clinton was motivated by enabling big military + big corporate profits and oil before everything, then by showing to the rest of the world that US is the boss. He did not care if 100s od 1000s get killed as collateral damage. That makes him responsible for those mass killings IMO
183 2018-06-11 23:36:22 I hate to tell you but thousands of American companies have been dealing with Russia since the USSR fell. Russia became oil rich with a ton of cheap high skilled high tech labor force. If you castigate anyone with any tie to Russia you would have to toss out 90% of both parties.
184 2018-06-11 23:36:06 When your friend cheats on their diet before you do: #Russia produced 11.09 million bpd of #oil during the first week of June, exceeding their cap of 10.95 million bpd & analysts (& speculators) estimate Russian producers have 300,000 bpd of spare capacity. #energy #OOTT
185 2018-06-11 23:35:50 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
186 2018-06-11 23:35:38 Instead of our government subsidizing oil companies, banks and whoever else is robbing us blind, they should subsidize the american people so they can acquire bicyles!  #RideABike

188 2018-06-11 23:35:29 ngl I found the receipt for my car's very first oil change buried deep in the glovebox & I teared up a little
189 2018-06-11 23:35:28 In the two decades prior, Chavez oversaw absolutely massive poverty reduction and increases in human development after two decades of total neglect. The UN were clear in their praise.

Then oil tanked, thanks to US production boom.
190 2018-06-11 23:35:15 Canada planning retaliatory tariffs against @realDonaldTrump. How about turning the oil taps off? How does $6.00 gas sound to the average #american consumer?
191 2018-06-11 23:35:03 Oil’s up but suffers 2nd straight monthly loss. I’m sure a certain electric car CEO is twirling his
192 2018-06-11 23:34:59 Hmmm, I think the Melissa oil I found is for fragrance only & so one for topical use is probably more expensive as I just found another that's 10ML for $129.95 <OUCH!
193 2018-06-11 23:34:55 Do you add the cumin before or after roasting? Any oil or butter?
194 2018-06-11 23:34:53 Your personality lets me know that. My family is built on wealth from oil, yet that don't make me better than anybody....just means I got some real paper to play with. Still hasn't changed me. I'm real and always will be

201 2018-06-11 23:34:09 @AlecBaldwin 
Can I recommend trying castor oil to clear up that fluid?
Topical.  Don't ingest.  
Babaflegmbye
202 2018-06-11 23:33:58 Yeah, that's the trick. You need that fat (we generally use olive oil) to crisp the skin nicely. Nobody's eating leathery potato skins.
203 2018-06-11 23:33:38 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
204 2018-06-11 23:33:34 If the over night cream doesn’t help try cutting all moisturizer out for a while. Your face may be compensating for the moisturizer if youve been wearing it for a while and if you stop your face may start producing natural oil again. I know a couple people this happened to
205 2018-06-11 23:33:34 Do you not like that the US is number one producer in the world for gas and oil now ? Do you not like that woman have high positions in the White House staff ? Do you honk it’s ok for the world to rip us off on tariffs ? Do you not want peace with NK ??
206 2018-06-11 23:33:26 ive dead ass never heard of avocado oil now I’m curious o__0

216 2018-06-11 23:31:43 Parkay is from back in the day when people thought spreadable vegetable oil was healthier than butter.
217 2018-06-11 23:31:36 Hey quick question ladies. How do yall keep oil/lotion off your clothes when you put them on?
218 2018-06-11 23:31:31 it's the way China has been sucking the blood of the anti-American regimes like Iran and Venezuela. Takes their oil and in exchange gives them credit in its own currency, so they can only use it to buy Chinese junk even if they don't need, ruining domestic industries
219 2018-06-11 23:31:27 Im sure with removal of internet regulations protections, corporate internet providers will in no way abuse this opportunity a d take advantage of the public..
Just as Im sure Oil/Gas companies are in no way taking advantage of removal of national monument protections #tytlive
220 2018-06-11 23:31:27 Brush with olive oil, sprinkle liberally with kosher salt, and then bake them naked on the wire oven rack. No foil. This is how you properly bake a potato.
221 2018-06-11 23:31:22 Now once again we are being held hostage by high gas prices.These prices almost tanked the country.With so much energy..we should not pay over 20p per gallon.Threaten to release oil reserves. Watch how fast they come down.These will not win you an election.

224 2018-06-11 23:31:06 Your comment is funny except for the fact family loves and forgives regardless.   He's gonna die alone.  His funeral can be in small chapel on the cheap.  Sad. So freaking sad.

236 2018-06-11 23:29:43 simple sugar face scrub 

1 tsp organic cane sugar (or granulated sugar) 
1 – 2 drops of water 
1 – 2 drops orange, lemon, lavender or melaleuca essential oil (optional) 

Using the tips of your fingers, gently rub scrub into clean face. Remove by rinsing with cool waters.
237 2018-06-11 23:29:20 I’d recommend exfoliation cloths. Med-hot water with quality bar soap. I prefer to lather with water off if in shower, I then scrub once with normal cloth and a second time with an exfoliator. Rinse and then use thick lotion and baby oil.
238 2018-06-11 23:29:19 More than a while, buddy. I'm all good. I'm using my other degrees and certifications and basically hiking while making as much $ as I used to. I recommend it, oil and gas inspection
239 2018-06-11 23:29:17 That oil money
240 2018-06-11 23:29:15 Coconut oil ,the wonder oil !
241 2018-06-11 23:29:02 There is so much evil shit my country’s administration is trying to get away with. I am exercising my #FirstAmendment right to #FreedomOfSpeech. We are ripping immigrant families apart, destroying our earth for oil, and nothing is stopping them.

At least not yet. #Resist #MAGA
242 2018-06-11 23:29:02 Your MCM uses a napkin to blot the excess oil off of his pizza.
243 2018-06-11 23:28:36 Peppermint oil is a great holistic approach!
244 2018-06-11 23:28:35 Two new tires, an oil change, and fixing the bar that snapped = WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.
245 2018-06-11 23:28:35 I haven’t tried it because I’m allergic to coconut oil but I think that’s the one that has it. I do like Curls Blueberry Bliss as a twisting cream, it does amazing in my hair.
246 2018-06-11 23:28:27 There is no bow between KSA-USA relations,the collaboration has been begun since 1933 when the first economic cooperation between the two countries began, with the Arab US  Oil Co. digging the first oil well. Saudi Arabia is a real ally & it’ll be forever.
247 2018-06-11 23:28:23 Aww do you want me to make you some oil
248 2018-06-11 23:28:22 Carbon based energy, oil, coal etc if not replaced with non carbon soon will destroy the polar ice and our atmosphere, simply the air we breath will no longer exists. How do we fix this? It's not all blockchain and bitcoin and money these are real problems!!!!
249 2018-06-11 23:28:18 no but really peppermint oil and hot tea
250 2018-06-11 23:28:07 Haha basically lol do all the work we don’t feel like doing. I would add oil change to the list too

252 2018-06-11 23:27:36 One thing I doubt I will let my kids ever forget is the fact that I had to take castor oil in the run up to going into labour 
253 2018-06-11 23:27:32 Solar employs more than oil, coal and gas combined.  Or it did.  Solar Companies might not be going for long.  The tariff gave China a serious upper hand.  :/
254 2018-06-11 23:27:25 Till those drops of oil that flies around when u r frying slashes on u

257 2018-06-11 23:27:09 So that's a no comment on the oil thing?
258 2018-06-11 23:27:01 To go back to the idea of using oil money to pay for MF.  The government is already running massive cash deficits with oil money already spent.  Where would this other oil money magically come from?  You cannot spend the same dollar twice.
259 2018-06-11 23:26:54 Basic live at oil
260 2018-06-11 23:26:46 Time to get this coconut oil off my hair 
261 2018-06-11 23:26:41 Then we can shut down all those oil rigs, shut the refineries down, all electric vehicles! The future is here baby!! Oh yeah!!
262 2018-06-11 23:26:30 That part I remember well. That was the year Rudd had his wreck out of turn 4 in the Busch Clash. Still recall the the oil wafting up into the grand stands. And Linda running from the pits. Very scary...
263 2018-06-11 23:26:23 The other day I saw a Tesla with a plate that said what oil ? I was like okay i see you. Don’t gotta rub it in
264 2018-06-11 23:26:12 Peppermint oil! Rub it on your temples and the back of your neck 
265 2018-06-11 23:26:10 Word of advice: don’t overdose on black seed oil. After feeling like I was gonna have a stroke for 2 hours, I keep throwing up.
266 2018-06-11 23:26:06 cut them in half and sprinkle olive oil and salt and pepper on them and cook at 400 :-)
267 2018-06-11 23:26:06 Cannabis oil?? Anyone??

269 2018-06-11 23:25:58 @realDonaldTrump blew up the Iran deal to raise the price of a barrel of oil for his authoritarian buddies especially Putin How is this not a source of investigation?
270 2018-06-11 23:25:58 The only reason the US has acted as world police over the last 50 years is to control world oil reserves and pander to the US military establishment/CIA and weapons manufacturers. Have to justify the $$$$Trillions spent some how.
271 2018-06-11 23:25:53 All my homies know me best , they say I’m fallin for you ...& that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
272 2018-06-11 23:25:47 things I have learned from playing car mechanic simulator 2015:
-I would honestly probably have a lot of fun repairing cars irl
-I still don't really like cars
-it's generally considered a bad idea to dump oil directly from the car's hot oil pan into your gaping and confused maw
273 2018-06-11 23:25:45 Yes post! I need a good twist gel. You like Mielle organics? Their babassu oil and mint deep conditioner is bomb
274 2018-06-11 23:25:33 Can the rhetoric Scheer, and tell us how u plan to tackle CC by making gas or oil cheaper? Bc that's essentially what you're moaning about here.
275 2018-06-11 23:25:09 Such a round bald head man needs that one hard slap on it  slap some oil on it too
276 2018-06-11 23:24:59 I’m so glad bae took my car to get a oil change done & my brakes getting done tomorrow lol cause lord knows I was not tryna pay for it
277 2018-06-11 23:24:53 おはあり！
278 2018-06-11 23:24:48 My first job I only made 175 every two weeks. It was enough to buy gas, oil, and have a little extra cash for drinks for cruising around. Now I make anything under 800 and I freak out.
279 2018-06-11 23:24:06 "almond oil turns me on"
280 2018-06-11 23:24:02 In reality it is majority of EU countries that buy oil/gas and other goods from Russia and it is really those countries that we have to really watch closely as they stab us in the back quite often on trade!!
281 2018-06-11 23:23:58 I live ten mins from Balmedie, it’s not middle of no where, it’s few mins from Aberdeen, Oil Capital of Europe! 
282 2018-06-11 23:23:53 Dont think you understand the relationship. Canada is one of the US creditors. Canada supplies 41% of US domestic oil. US region producing fruit, nuts and veg is now dependent on Canadian water. US imports 80 million megawatt hours of electricity from Canada. I could go on.
283 2018-06-11 23:23:50 I'm aware 90% of my tweets these past 24-48ish hours have been funny thins my mother has said but she literally just called my bottle of castor oil my "eyebrow grower" so there's that
284 2018-06-11 23:23:41 We’ll become the largest investor and trading partner with NoKo  of all nations . Our oil, steel, aluminum, wheat, corn, cattle, etc. are already negotiated. Bet $100
285 2018-06-11 23:23:34 yas i’ve used that foundation for years lol. that oil is at like walmart I think, maybe target.
286 2018-06-11 23:23:19 だからな？しゅんしゅんとツイートのタイミングかぶるからめっちゃ笑うねんて(´^ω^｀)
287 2018-06-11 23:23:11 Lol.. Yeah, Putin tells Trump to flood Europe with US oil because he likes losing money.
288 2018-06-11 23:23:11 If the equity isn't borrowed, then it is oil money, which is borrowed as well (borrowed from ourselves.)  If we forgive repayment of the equity, then we rob ourselves twice over (first by spending it on a nutbar idea.  The second by not paying it back.
289 2018-06-11 23:22:43 Does anyone else have a horrible feeling that somebody has found oil in North Korea?
290 2018-06-11 23:22:29 I love that @dan_bernstein will rightly rip #TomBrady for selling his BS snake oil products yet his own station peddles garbage Alkaline water on the podcast.

294 2018-06-11 23:21:57 I fracking hate oil.
295 2018-06-11 23:21:50 As for using oil revenues,  if you mean the small equity stakes,  it is worth roughly $40 million annual in net income.  You need $800 million in year one alone. Since it is now in a stand-alone corporation, you'd have to float it out to consumers as a gift to cover rates.
296 2018-06-11 23:21:36 huge fucking beetle in my oil pastels, i think eveything is  out to kill me today
297 2018-06-11 23:21:24 Annual budget speeches allocated money for Nalcor oil equity and MF but never explicitly stating it was borrowed money. In addition, if money was borrowed it would have immediate repayment so I don’t see the increase in debt servicing cost you reference.
298 2018-06-11 23:21:11 Our auto place fucked up our car again. Legit came in for an oil change and filter. It was a nightmare getting it home so now they have to tow it back to their location to see what they did wrong.

313 2018-06-11 23:19:23 Since @realDonaldTrump took office, corp. have been given more cntrl over internet, Wall St. rules 2 control abuse repealed, Nat Park land taken to give to oil, biggest tax break 4 rich, and they are trying 2 allow ins to disqualify pre-existing conditions- for the forgotten man.

317 2018-06-11 23:19:04 Too late happens and the Trump is the final straw as oil state propaganda news and internet access in a world gone to the dark side.
Earth is in acceleration of Extinction 6 and world plays treason w Trump.
Can anyone actually consider how God feels about the lack of this story.~
318 2018-06-11 23:18:55 Overheard on LBC. We send all our North Sea  oil & gas to Russia. They then send it back via the EU who put a tariff on it. I nearly choked on a Goji berry, the presenter said nothing. More Brexit propoganda.
319 2018-06-11 23:18:37 80% of cooking seems to be rolling things in olive oil and sprinkling salt.
320 2018-06-11 23:18:37 I just use a sharp knife and slice it paper thin, pretty much dissolves in a pan of oil
321 2018-06-11 23:18:33 I could make an argument for every type of fry being the best. And also being the worst.
Wedge fries are the best when you have high quality potatoes and great oil. They’re the best kind of hipster yuppie fries.
Shoe string are great super crispy with powdered seasoning.
322 2018-06-11 23:18:30 this is the key reason there MUST be a vote in Parliament before any future war commitments made

And until we know who the key players are behind the push for war - No more SECRETS if the Aust people involved 

If Oil barons involved THE ANSWER IS NO
323 2018-06-11 23:18:25 That fuckface Trudeau started either on purpose or because of his usual incompetence. 

Trump said 4 times before G7 that lower dairy tariffs + increased defence spending = trade deal.

Besides, Trump still wants our discounted oil, come what may.

327 2018-06-11 23:17:25 Oil currently $75/barrel. Exports to EU up. Spending on war will be down. Tax receipts from Scottish based civil servants will rise. You have no idea what things will be like in the future. Every other country manages. Why wouldn't Scotland? Why are we uniquely incapable?

331 2018-06-11 23:16:53 So USA can get more of our oil ....that way we won't be dependent on foreign oil ...
332 2018-06-11 23:16:50 I love how some alternative energy advocates completely ignore the fact alternative energies need(ed) oil to develop. They live in a magical dreamland of oil-less perfection and sidestep my original  and  question. Oil was necessarily 1st, whether it was put there by God or ?
333 2018-06-11 23:16:31 But if any of the equity was oil money and we don;t pay ourselves back that amount, we are robbing ourselves twice over.  (But it was all borrowed, unless Tom Marshall fibbed)
334 2018-06-11 23:16:16 I guess many people "forgot" the famous photo of Rumsfeld shaking Hussein's hand in Iraq. Not long after that, Hussein was branded "crazy and dangerous"-- because he went off the oil bidness reservation, started doing business with non-U.S. transnationals. that's a no-no!
335 2018-06-11 23:16:12 Taking olive oil is not for the faint of heart, my God.

386 2018-06-11 23:09:17 Me getting a Publix sub: "Ok, & then a bunch of vinegar. No oil, just a lot of vinegar."

Me:"...Ok, like A LOT of vinegar"

Her: *adds like 1/2 tsp of vinegar*

Me: "Can I get a little more?"

Her: *rolls eyes & sighs loudly*

404 2018-06-11 23:06:08 It is. Totally sucks. Changing the fryer oil, getting burnt by the oil, changing the outside trash can liners, working drive thru. It’s a teenager’s own personal Afghanistan. Hell, the pay is about the same.
405 2018-06-11 23:05:58 Seriously it's so obvious it's downright infuriating. You could so easily write a teenage poison ivy story trying to stop an oil pipeline for instance.

420 2018-06-11 23:02:57 Starting from today @WingyChung and myself will be on a potato only diet. Two weeks of only eating potatoes - no salt, no oil, no butter. Wish us luck!
421 2018-06-11 23:02:57 I can live with it. Not what I originally wanted, but some times you have to be a grown up & accept that you can't have everything. So FOM is a small price to pay for rest of SM deal. SM is the oil to keep the wheels of commerce &industry turning. Dogmatic purity won't !
422 2018-06-11 23:02:53 What’s a good natural product to define my curls, hold moisture, help with breakage, and promote hair growth.... I’ve tried design essentials, Shia moisture, coco nut oil,  etc etc I have 3c and 4c hair
423 2018-06-11 23:02:47 thank you so much! I have done art on and off most of my life. Been studying oil for the last decade. Did a lot of ugly drawings and paintings. Had the incredible fortune to make freinds with artist community in DC.

426 2018-06-11 23:02:20 ....ㅎ..학교 가겠습니다...(털썩
427 2018-06-11 23:02:17 Yeah most definitely.  Just saying in principle he at least makes a good point.  Unfortunately you’re we would use it to build a wall or oil rigs
428 2018-06-11 23:02:05 Down Bondi in the good old days we would pay to be sprayed all over with coconut oil and then lie in the sun all day frying like a piece of bacon. An incredibly attractive mahogany tan would ensue. Also lifetimes of work for dermatologists. And consequent post-operative pain.
429 2018-06-11 23:02:03 My grandpa was telling me about how one time his friend named moose was hammered and decided to drink a quart of motor oil 

Moose wherever you are I hope you're doing ok
430 2018-06-11 23:01:50 Maybe try talking to your doctor about trying spirinoloactone. A side effect is slowing down oil production
431 2018-06-11 23:01:39 Dude, the Entire Current U.S. Population and the Yet UnBorn are in Debt thanks to the Military Industrial Complex, Government Spending, Anglo-American Banking and Oil Interests.
432 2018-06-11 23:01:05 Buti pa yung oil, baby. Ikaw hindi. Oppsss 
433 2018-06-11 23:00:53 You are mixing apples  with oranges . If Obama would have put tariffs on the Oil then it be a different story . But it took the federal government to buy a pipeline  here to get  the job done . The conservatives here still bitch about it

436 2018-06-11 23:00:29 Investors consider alternative investments as a way to diversify their portfolio for risk management. We use ETFs to get exposure to alternatives like volatility or commodities such as gold and oil. We apply our hedge fund-style trading strategies to alternatives.
437 2018-06-11 23:00:15 you would really trigger me if you described what gun oil tasted like
438 2018-06-11 23:00:02 did belong to man, who is surprised at anything which happens is derived. Such as bathing appears to thee- oil, sweat, dirt,
439 2018-06-11 23:00:01 You smell snake oil salesmen. Dr Dre & Iovine...2 uneducated billionaires selling education...the irony
440 2018-06-11 22:59:42 Yeah unfortunately; force 8 storm while onboard the DSND Nordica, a trenching vessel, west of Shetland, 1998. This was definitely the worst but not the only one from the oil industry off Scotland. I actually enjoyed it although it was scary.
441 2018-06-11 22:59:31 You also killed over million Iraqi and Afghan civilians to secure oil and poppy fields. Creating a power void in the middle East that saw the rise of ISIS. Don't kid your self you are not the good guys, you create war to sell weapons and take resources.
442 2018-06-11 22:59:29 I think he means one only counts “justified homicides” as DGUs and ignores all other defensive uses.
443 2018-06-11 22:59:25 Rachel Ray has had more of an influence on my life than I realized. I don't think I've ever not referred to extra virgin olive oil as "EVOO."
444 2018-06-11 22:58:55 I mean, it's not in common usage in the (sub?-)dialect I use so it generally doesn't come up? However, "motor oil" - there's a big distinction in types and usages between motor oil (say, detergent-free single-viscocity turbine oil) and gasoline engine oil
445 2018-06-11 22:58:49 When the supervisor starts yelling i shut up.
When he leaves i start talking again.
446 2018-06-11 22:58:46 BRO THERE WAS ONE TIME MY LIL BROTHER PUT WD-40 IN THE OIL CONTAINER FOR OUR LAWN MOWER AND MY DAD SLAPPED ME SO HARD IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS I GOT A NOSEBLEED. Said it was my fault since i’m the one who mows the lawn.
447 2018-06-11 22:58:36 Republicans are traitors to America. Trump admitted to working for Putin as he attacked our closest allies. REPUBLICAN SILENCE = CONSENT.  Republicans are in bed w Russia & other unfriendly countries Trump@is taking bribes from.  ITS ALL ABOUT OIL.
448 2018-06-11 22:58:28 Cetaphil. Lu pake acnes yg oil control yak? Emang narik ituu. Btw lu ganti fw baru aja apa gimana? Kalo lu ganti fw dari A ke B langsung emg bakal jadi begitu

450 2018-06-11 22:58:01 I don't think its kompromat, I think its oil and the wealth that goes with it.
451 2018-06-11 22:57:46 Wonderful Jeremy. Am supporting you, with pride, but please, please don't fail us on overseas policy as Blair did so shamefully. What we are doing in Syria is unforgivable. What we did in Libya - same. Proxy wars have to stop. I'd rather he lights went out than kill for oil.

458 2018-06-11 22:56:42 I like my popcorn - small white kernels pooped in white truffle oil.
459 2018-06-11 22:56:36 -oil otherwise it'll drown the egg but enough you can flick some with the teaspoon when you tilt the pan. depending on the heat of your stove my mums is hotter and i put it on 2 but mine is shit and i need it on 3-4. get it off with a spatula to not break the yolk too soon
460 2018-06-11 22:56:35 We have used fryer oil for FREE..... come and get it!
461 2018-06-11 22:56:23 @Walmart in Chicopee, MA is a self checkout store and my shopping experience has become pure hell. RIP591. Oil change only now.

465 2018-06-11 22:55:42 What is Canada‘s commitment exactly? Extracting more oil? More pipes? More fracking? Are Trudeau’s weak policies better than Trump’s inaction?

467 2018-06-11 22:55:36 every once in a while i think about the parallel universe where FO4 is set in Canada and they go into the lore about how the US annexed it because the citizens protested US troop movements thru it and the building of an oil pipeline in their home and i get real sad
468 2018-06-11 22:55:35 Worked out a solution with NK ending like a 70 year feud with a dictator when people swore he would get us nuked, created jobs, exporting our oil, better trade deals, stuck it to the FDA and big pharm, favorable stance on marijuana
469 2018-06-11 22:55:30 when you do the egg make sure the oil is sizzling before you put it on otherwise the white but just stays clear on top of the oil, and use a teaspoon and tilt the pan so you can splash oil on top of the yolk to cook the top of it without burning the bottom. don't use too much-
470 2018-06-11 22:55:30 sliced peaches + corn (frozen) in a skillet until some are roasted + sliced radish + red onion + cilantro + adobo from canned chipotles + lime + olive oil + cilantro. a salad for all summer, even when peaches aren't very sweet yet
471 2018-06-11 22:55:22 Nooo, I’m devastated for you you need to coconut oil it quick so it grows back faster
472 2018-06-11 22:55:03 In the example I gave, if you dig deeper, the scientists arguing against climate change are employed by the oil industry, that’s irresponsible. To the viewer it appears that the jury is out on the issue, when the truth is actually the opposite.
473 2018-06-11 22:54:59 Not sure of the point of that. Are you suggesting wind replaces oil because it doesn't. It needs oil to be constructed and operate.
474 2018-06-11 22:54:28 Oh yeah destroy oil industry and future auto industry but have nearly 300% tax on US dairy to protect Quebec dairy farmers. I wonder who else this PM is willing to hang dry for Quebec

476 2018-06-11 22:54:24 The Canadian Federal government provides billions in subsidies to oil and gas companies most of which are American. US  ag sector heavily subsidized. Cry me a river about CDN subsidies.  Boycott all American product.

481 2018-06-11 22:53:35 love to oil hat ass
482 2018-06-11 22:53:33 What a mistake this was. Go back to the oil industry where you might do more good.
483 2018-06-11 22:53:28 It’s killing us in Oklahoma, while oil is laughing its way to the bank and trying to stop the teacher pay raise.

487 2018-06-11 22:53:12 It’s bc if he acknowledged that humans are damaging the environment, businesses (the most prolific polluters) would have to be regulated & industries like coal & oil would be replaced by more eco-friendly solutions. And he & his billionaires friends would not benefit from that
488 2018-06-11 22:53:10 I use mine for everything. It's especially useful for quickly and painlessly checking the temperature of water or oil as well.
489 2018-06-11 22:53:04 Uber has major problems - they drastically underpay drivers. We own our cars, buy the gas, provide the service, make the repairs, change the oil - then, Uber takes over half the fare.  Honestly, Uber is full of it.  Did you know they only pay 51 cents a mile in Detroit? Big Cost
490 2018-06-11 22:53:02 So, in other words your pardon was to help you sell books too!  Man what a bonus!!  Perfect timing. Ol Don Don sure knows how to sell snake oil.
491 2018-06-11 22:52:49 The person(s) who invented robo-calls should be boiled in oil and then sentenced to listen to them 24-7 for the next 100 years. I don't speak to machines (except maybe a few choice swear words).
492 2018-06-11 22:52:48 infiltrating numerous political organizations and lobbying groups, and promoting extreme right-wing propaganda that is widely accepted by the GOP. Russian oil for-profit business schemes, btw key figures in the GOP and Russia stand out./3
493 2018-06-11 22:52:35 Saudi Arabia is up to 41% public debt per GDP. In 2014 it was at 8%. The Oil Kingdom has a massive problem no one is talking about. Currently growing at a rate of 5% a year.
If they can't get oil prices over 100 dpb The kingdom will fall.
494 2018-06-11 22:52:29 I came home to a cross in olive oil on my front door.
495 2018-06-11 22:52:12 You can thank the same WALL ST. TRAITORS you used to take gas/heating oil and diesel fuel at the CCM for all of it! More than just a few TRAITORS in USA. Why did you lie about OPEC?

498 2018-06-11 22:51:24 I just remembered I got an oil stain on my beautiful floor-length flowy dress on the first and only time I wore it, & screaming with rage because every attempt I make to be hot is a serious investment towards getting a boyfriend and I can't afford any financial or visual mistakes
499 2018-06-11 22:51:15 Looks like it needs a light coating of glove oil

501 2018-06-11 22:51:14 Point is, crude oil prices have doubled under Trump. Russia is dependent on crude oil exports. Trump chased Iran out of the crude oil market. What a puzzler, wonder if we can figure this head scratcher out?
502 2018-06-11 22:51:02 Coal is 19th century energy

Oil and gas are 20th century energy

Wind wave solar is 21st century energy

Coal is a filthy old joke. But oil and gas are also over.
503 2018-06-11 22:50:58 Then healthy fat (peanut butter, egg yolk, vegetable oil, some fruits etc) is calorically dense. 1g of carbs is 4 calories; 1g of fat is 9 calories. So eating the same amount of fat in a meal is twice as much as calories as if you ate the same amount of carbs
504 2018-06-11 22:50:58 WELL HIS  DEAL SUCKS  ANYWAY  WE DON'T NEED USA IT'S  A BLESSING WE CAN SELL OUT OIL AT PAR NOW NOT FOR PENNIES
505 2018-06-11 22:50:57 My dad and I both agree. And we even think that the Mediterannean sea salt atmosphere might have had an impact on the oil of those artworks. Let's hope they restore them quick.

516 2018-06-11 22:50:06 A little hard to make out but this is scoring on the cylinder wall. Lets oil get past the piston and burns it. This one’s using almost 4L of oil between oil changes.

521 2018-06-11 22:49:43 (1) Oil cleanse 
- Supaya boleh bersihkan sampai dalam pores

(3) Hydrate 
- Guna hydrating toner, essence, serum etc. Ikutlah kesesuaian kulit awak. Make sure lock dgn moisturizer.

(4) Exfoliate
- Guna konjac sponge, gentle scrubs, peeling gel. Kalau solid kukuh boleh try AHA.
522 2018-06-11 22:49:36 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
523 2018-06-11 22:49:30 They are trash. We don’t use oil money. We generate enough money and no depth. 4th highest club in revenue income in the world lol.
524 2018-06-11 22:49:28 Coconut oil works awesome for vegan recipes. If you don’t want a coconut smell or taste, use refined.
525 2018-06-11 22:49:15 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
526 2018-06-11 22:48:11 What gets me is the oil doesn't get you high. This is seriously bullshit.
527 2018-06-11 22:47:28 I think it’s time for me to go back to the oil refinery
528 2018-06-11 22:47:24 I see y’all talking about senior pranks nigga at out school but baby oil all over the stairs
529 2018-06-11 22:47:19 The truth is that CANADA  has lot of oil that US wants !! That’s why!!!
530 2018-06-11 22:46:57 I hate when people call BHO (or any kind of hash oil) dabs. It irritates the fuck outta me an I don't know why
531 2018-06-11 22:46:54 Soooo it’s 3k to fix my car .... all I wanted to get was an oil change .. this is why I didn’t want my Audi bro if I had a regular ass car I wouldn’t be havin this problem 
532 2018-06-11 22:46:41 Grand junction is a great place to live if you’re a hick, and too big of a douche bag to get along with anyone in a small town, but not smart enough to work the oil fields
533 2018-06-11 22:46:18 I understand but it can make a difference to some. Obama refused to ok the pipeline going thru land important to Natives & made huge swaths of land into National Monuments, some important to Natives. Trump OK'd the pipeline & shrunk the protected lands 2 allow oil/gas drill, etc.
534 2018-06-11 22:45:58 Everytime I change a headlight or taillight I try to pump myself up to learn how to change my oil. But it never happens.

541 2018-06-11 22:44:51 No, your thesis was "Syria can’t even feed themselves but I’m sure they have enough money to buy weapons from NOKO and feed 25M people."

And you seem to have forgotten the whole "oil" thing. Not to mention their friends, "Russia".

545 2018-06-11 22:44:18 The eco-extremists took the lead on fake news long before it became a thing. Their well funded and skilled (yet constantly unethical and sometimes illegal) risk amplification campaign successfully demonized the oil sands. To this day, many Canadians remain thoroughly deceived.
546 2018-06-11 22:44:10 Bcs skin type tak senang senang berubah. To change your skin type from one extreme end to normal needs work. Lagipun kulit mmg akan naturally produce sebum bcs it's vital for the skin. Kalau takde oil langsung, then your skin will end up dry.
547 2018-06-11 22:44:05 Filthy oil money
548 2018-06-11 22:44:00 That is a non sequitur, we are talking about the liquid fuels used on the West Coast. That there is lots of oil moving elsewhere is not terribly relevant to this discussion.
549 2018-06-11 22:43:57 This whole thing stinks of Russia. We will never know what was promised. He bitches about Canada taken us for a ride but I’m sure he will give this murderous dictator barrels of oil and money if they stop threatening us with their fake nukes.

551 2018-06-11 22:43:41 Hey Ford Motor Company, next time you decide on where to put your oil filter on a 5.7L engine, can you put it in a more convenient place? 

Like in a tire? Inside the fuel tank? In the Korean demilitarized zone?
552 2018-06-11 22:43:39 All natural things: shea butter, honey, coconut oil. As I Am cowash and Garnier Fructisse honey blend is great.
553 2018-06-11 22:43:33 Thankyou! I just did like a banana and olive oil hair treatment and omg it was horrible. Do not recommend, mashed banana is so hard to get out of your hair hahaha
554 2018-06-11 22:43:31 I always have a laugh at the designation 'Unknown'. I would think every single oil company knows exactly where their oil wells are and any oil from a variety of sources could surely be designated as such.
555 2018-06-11 22:43:18 If your lips are every dry: 
1. Brown sugar
2. Honey
3. Olive oil

556 2018-06-11 22:43:08 #overheardonthescanner someone left oil cooking on the stove and set off the smoke detectors and fire alarms. Come on people watch what you are doing! Too many fire calls for this! #Auburn

558 2018-06-11 22:42:42 Salvini forget ENI ,the italian oil company is in Libia winning money with libian resources.why Salvini do not made drilling in Italy?better made money with libian lifes
559 2018-06-11 22:42:42 I make @chrissyteigen ‘s Cacio e Pepe recipe so often that the page is covered in cheese and oil and it makes me happy.
560 2018-06-11 22:42:42 For anyone that needs an oil change or ever needs a plug for them, I’m your guy to hit up.
561 2018-06-11 22:42:32 Adding those and cutting back a little on chemical exfoliation will help. Also add grapeseed oil.
562 2018-06-11 22:42:31 I would say that is pretty ridiculous buying back goods that were poached from us to begin with.
 The governor is too busy trying to destroy the oil industry so he can have his name on a Chinese gas line.
563 2018-06-11 22:42:11 my tire pressure light and oil change light came on at the same time. like.. do i realllly need a car? cause....
564 2018-06-11 22:42:06 My understanding from an AMO workshop is oil and dried herb available first - edibles to be added later. Not aware of any restrictions of where you could eat a gummy bear. Of course some workplace considerations being discussed
565 2018-06-11 22:42:01 I was using a balancing serum from image for a while and I liked that. I ran out of that and hyaluronic acid and just never repurchased smh. I also have a facial oil from arbonne I just haven’t triedyou think adding those 3 in will help?
566 2018-06-11 22:41:51 I recommend Polygala root (natural NMDA antagonist/AMPA agonist, triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, MAOI, but mild and neuroregenerative) as well as Nigella sativa oil (great for detox and inflammation/candida). Both also potentiate considerably and would benefit you personally
567 2018-06-11 22:41:32 Yeah, and they sell a bunch of oil, too, to pay for it.
568 2018-06-11 22:41:25 Their loss, I would oil up my breast and everything
569 2018-06-11 22:41:13 Alyssa’s dad checked my oil then told her she needs to take it  yes girl take my car 
570 2018-06-11 22:41:04 Your face like fat & oil but you won't cover your brezz!
571 2018-06-11 22:40:58 if you’re using it as an oil, inserting it directly you won’t need to wait 6 weeks. that’s only if you’re taking it in pill form or as leaves . neem oil can be used as a natural spermicide & it last up to 5 hours before you would have to do it again.
572 2018-06-11 22:40:58 @KySportsRadio wants his fries cooked in dirty oil which is the last thing you want since dirty oil doesn't cook well, isn't safe, and won't keep temp  Yea good luck with the restaurant
573 2018-06-11 22:40:45 As a means of saving gas (oil and coal) wind turbines may be useful. However, a renewable that cannot be relied upon to provide base-load, must always be backed up - meaning that it's not really a generator of electricity.
574 2018-06-11 22:40:39 You full-on cannot do sexy restaurant romance. Nothing is sexy when you've been working foir eight days in a row and you smell like stale olive oil and Romano cheese.

585 2018-06-11 22:39:06 Nice use of oil paints. 
586 2018-06-11 22:39:01 Hahahaha I remember these! I also collected ALL of the trading cards. The artwork was always so good. Some of the oil paintings were photorealistic.
587 2018-06-11 22:38:57 Left my car with my mom so she can get an oil change for me while I was at work. Came back my oil is changed and she is hand washing my car in the driveway. Oh and she put hem little fresheners in it to. I love that beautiful woman.
588 2018-06-11 22:38:41 Guess they haven’t ever heard of “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”
Oil is big, but it makes you depend on constantly changing prices. One day you can be super well off and the other piss poor.
589 2018-06-11 22:38:36 Pupitar. This troublesome Pokémon can't feel guilt—they can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace is extremely powerful.
590 2018-06-11 22:38:27 Sitting outside at Capri with the fam and the Shih Tzu. The dog won’t eat bread by itself but will eat it with olive oil and cheese. Go figure. #italianshihtzu

593 2018-06-11 22:38:05 #JustMusing

It's now clear that the Trump/Sessions DoJ has no problem with concentration camps for Hispanics. And apparently many Americans don't either.

But will they be okay w/ concentration camps for Canadians, too?

Or perhaps Pruitt is just covetous of their oil sands, eh?
594 2018-06-11 22:38:03 Gotta love it when customers go out of their way to get you a slurpee for hooking em up with a deal on an oil change
595 2018-06-11 22:37:50 Next time I fuck I'm pouring a whole bottle of baby oil on a bitch.
596 2018-06-11 22:37:44 Correct. The reference to the 1970s is related to the Saudi government taking the full control of Saudi Aramco and the Saudi oil policy.
597 2018-06-11 22:37:38 I would try a setting (foam)mousse once braids are in. That reduces frizz and works more like a gel to hold them in place. Olive Oil brand has a good one
598 2018-06-11 22:37:36 Bush Jr: My Papi wanted peace
w/NK but Saddam was causing a problem with our oil. So he went after Saddam.Then I could have talked some sense into liddle Kim's Papi (you know he was part of the axis that was evil) but Sadaam wanted to kill my Papi. So I went after Saddam instead.

600 2018-06-11 22:37:11 @JustinTrudeau How about we just recall all of our hockey players from the US, stop sending oil, and turn the G7 into the G6...we'll trade with the G6. #ThanksCanada
601 2018-06-11 22:36:53 Hooray for our politicians let's also do more to keep our resources in Canada and make the products here like our oil instead of sending it south and buying it back in products Also do our best to start discouraging cross border shopping reduce the trade imbalance!
602 2018-06-11 22:36:47 I'll lotion you down , or would you rather oil me ??

610 2018-06-11 22:34:58 America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria.Apr 12, 2012  so old news ... looking for updated info
611 2018-06-11 22:34:45 That’s almost what I make running, repairing and maintaining a crushing plant. Welding, Oxy-Acetylene cutting, swinging sledgehammers, turning 2” wrenches, shoveling crushed stone, coming home covered in dust, grease and oil. You don’t deserve 15 bucks an hour to flip burgers.
612 2018-06-11 22:34:33 Xi stopped the testing asswipe. You had nothing to do with it. Putin sell’s oil to them so sanctions MEAN nothing. You might as well pick your nose. Oh yeah. The Saudis just bombed Doctors Without Borders in Yemen. Well Done!

617 2018-06-11 22:33:50 The thing is, 95% of the Venezuelan economy is oil based. Imagine have that level of overspecialization in a game, the character would be almost always trash. And every Venezuelan government never makes a rainy day check, so we end up in this brutal rollercoaster.
618 2018-06-11 22:33:41 If I tell you I’m BATHING in coconut oil rn , best believe it 
619 2018-06-11 22:33:36 Please ask candidates if they realize pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time. IMF Externalities:  Prices Do Not Capture All Costs.  Asthma, heart and lung problems, etc
620 2018-06-11 22:33:20 Lies, fraud, greed. 

Now WWF = eco-terrorists. 

Executives at WWF want big pay increases and bonuses from US donners to cripple Canadian Oil industry

We need legislation to make this criminal
621 2018-06-11 22:33:18 You’ll be fine!  May I recommend a saline nose spray, lots of Vitamin C, lots is sleep, and Oil of Oregano every day. It comes in drops; I would recommend 7 or 8 drops under the tongue daily. Tastes horrible but it works!  Take care of yourself. #BeSafe
622 2018-06-11 22:33:16 Stock prices are up, the price of a barrel of oil has jumped 50%,  & we have  inverted short term interest rates; all of which is happening now & all of which are indicators of a recession. Ask @seanhannity...then again maybe not. He's not even journalist.

#Leduc #pizzaphone
629 2018-06-11 22:31:30 Ok, this becomes a more complicated and long chain of events, but a TLDR: No, it's not because of the oil prices entirely. The US is better, obviously, because its a developed country (although that is becoming more debatable in other regions, not where I am).
630 2018-06-11 22:31:17 commercials are really scary after not seeing them for so long. why are prescription drugs advertised?? why is milk advertised?? why did i just see a commercial about crude oil?????

643 2018-06-11 22:29:21 But is it better than in Venezuela? I only traveled to the US a couple of times and never lived there. It’s a little sad to see my teachers try to defend the Venezuelan government saying that it’s all fault of the fall of oil prices

649 2018-06-11 22:28:26 @LBC That caller should know that UK North Sea Oil and Gas comes into Scotland, not England, so "England" (as she puts it) blocking their pipeline would probably be a waste of time.
650 2018-06-11 22:28:25 I'm gonna break some legos here -- it feels weird talking about r- vs K- wrt sex-specific strategies because r- and K- strategies have "kid-centered" definitions. Polygamy can still be K-selection if the father is an oil sheikh. "Parasitism" or "sneaky male" is a better concept.

656 2018-06-11 22:27:52 There are on average about 1,200 defensive shootings every year, according to the FBI.

A much more reliable number than a phone poll conducted once by the CDC, and never replicated.
657 2018-06-11 22:27:48 Adam calls me when I'm at home and he's at the grocery store, to ask me where the olive oil is. 

"I'm not at the store Adam."
658 2018-06-11 22:27:30 So I didn’t realise that it’d gotten hot enough for my coconut oil to melt and I opened it and it spilt everywhere 
659 2018-06-11 22:27:26 At least half of the military budget is spent to protect the offshore interests of energy companies. Follow the pipelines and transport routes of the oil companies. You can do that by plotting US military installations on a map. Same lines! Funny huh?
660 2018-06-11 22:27:11 I know but i do it becuz I don't use my oil twice. When I use the fryer I put much more oil and my mom be like "se pa atè mwen jwen lajan poum achte'l
661 2018-06-11 22:26:57 I work for an Alaska based company, and the economy is tied very closely to oil prices. The higher the oil price the better the Alaskan economy. Therefore, higher gas prices is a positive for me. I realize I'm in the minority, just throwing out a random benefit to me :)
662 2018-06-11 22:26:56 Lol yea I use tea tree oil for my oily t zone
663 2018-06-11 22:26:51 As sho said.. hiding is worst then anything lucky over 7 years ago litterly middle of first date I was like I smoke weed, nothing major just morning/night smoker. Surprisingly he was open about it never had a issue, I just keep it away from him, vape honey oil or smoke outside.
664 2018-06-11 22:26:46  my very thought.
665 2018-06-11 22:26:36 No doubt. I'm fine with the free service at Dick's for steaming and beating it also, but you still need to oil and shape it.
666 2018-06-11 22:26:34 Decided to practice my baritone since I’ve decided on being a marching sycamore this year, but my valves keep sticking and I have no oil  #bandgeekproblems
667 2018-06-11 22:26:18 in my most humble opinion, chalk pastels are superior to oil- they're so malleable! (granted that also means you gotta be TRES CAREFUL..) 
She looks AWESOME. I love the depth you got in those shadows!
668 2018-06-11 22:26:15 actually this is exactly the science behind it lmao. Putting oil on your skin stops your skin from producing its own oil.
669 2018-06-11 22:26:09 And we need to complete the trans mountain and start getting paid world prices for our oil and stop the rip off from the US. And then complete the energy east pipeline so we can ship our product to Europe or use it ourselves. Stop importing to meet eastern needs.
670 2018-06-11 22:25:39 @marklevinshow tariffs on steel are not the same as any other tariff and only oil is as important as far as products we need to produce in USA. We need our own steel and oil or our superpower status is gone. Creates conflict of interest and complicates "honest" reasons for war.
671 2018-06-11 22:25:09 Did you know 40% of our oil comes from Canada?  Imagine the cost at pump if Trump keeps this up.
672 2018-06-11 22:25:08 US does the same things ... for politics. The real problem is that Trump has Canada over a barrel because he knows we have no alternative but to sign whatever he wants us to. Why? Because we have one customer eg? Oil

693 2018-06-11 22:22:08 I use coconut oil on the mane and tail and good old fashion elbow grease on the body

696 2018-06-11 22:22:00 Yelp’d the highest rated oil change place in my new hood & when I pulled up the lead mechanic had his whole face tatted so I just kept on driving. Not because I didn’t trust his work, I just couldn’t trust myself not to stare & make it supes awks.
697 2018-06-11 22:21:59 Can you send proof of that? And don't forget to include the reduced rate we change the USA for fuel? Keystone will get our oil to tidewater and let us sell at world prices.
698 2018-06-11 22:21:59 castor oil, hair masks, learning protective hairstyles, and being too lazy to cut it until it’s gotten long again.
699 2018-06-11 22:21:56 does being zapped by holding a conducting carbon fiber rod into an oil ignition transformer light arc with 15kV @ 20mA count towards these kind of achievements?

716 2018-06-11 22:18:32 Ya. But your tax cut is going to Big Oil not so great for most Americans. No thanks to you. Tariffs will bring the economy to a screeching halt. Good going putz
717 2018-06-11 22:18:20 had seitan for the first time and it was delicious. like tofu or mushrooms it absorbs whatever's around it. it already had a bit chipotle/chili flavoring in it and I sautéed it in olive oil and sprinkled mediterranean steak seasoning on it and tore the strips into smaller pieces
718 2018-06-11 22:18:09 I think I might finally have overcome my fear of oil paints...

Hey, did you ever try the coconut oil on the pole & watch them *sumbitches slip & slide everywhere. 
721 2018-06-11 22:17:37 They absolutely are! I'm 50 years old, and have worked for many women. From Judy Cox, the owner of the first greenhouse I worked at as a teen, to Stacy Schusterman, owner and President of a mult-billion dollar oil and gas company. It's way past time this was an issue with some.

723 2018-06-11 22:17:10 Coconut oil bc it was handy and I like the consistency.
724 2018-06-11 22:17:01 It's pretty good by itself. xD I can see what you mean with it being ripe as heck. Just dose in some olive oil first. 

If there's too much garlic, cover it with cheese. Repeat as necessary.
725 2018-06-11 22:16:58 Much obliged!! Tomorrow I'll probably bring my peppermint oil with me just in case, though.
726 2018-06-11 22:16:51 HAHA literally me with the coconut oil and my exact words to you every time about a bitch boy. and you when i don’t know what to order yeah get that and we’ll half both of them 
727 2018-06-11 22:16:23 keep our gas and oil in Canada . stop the flow to the US. why do we pay more than they do for our oil and gas

740 2018-06-11 22:14:58 Weak USD helped raise oil prices, but that was mostly the EMs raising demand with less supply increase (pre-shale, tar sands). USD was weakened.

Clinton started off with balanced CAD, kept it for 2 years under Bentsen. Rubin pursued Strong Dollar Policy+ brought in Asian exports
741 2018-06-11 22:14:57 Someone should make it oil painting of that picture and send it to each one of those idiots.

756 2018-06-11 22:12:55 Carbon Budgets don't dictate what the rest of the world does. The rest of the world doesn't even have to burn oil, all they have to do is have population growth... so speeding up the process or slowing it down is irrelevant. Ultimately your argument boils down to warmongering.
757 2018-06-11 22:12:40 Would not see by now. In the future it would come sometime after millions of people dead in Middle East due to oil wars and climate shitholed to Precambrian (extrapolating, sorry).
758 2018-06-11 22:12:10 You are unbalanced, obviously wine weighs more than olive oil.
759 2018-06-11 22:12:08 @hayleysoraya Have you tried organic coconut oil for sore eyes? recommend it #londontheatre1 top tip :)
760 2018-06-11 22:12:07 Absolutely.  The time has come for decent people to protect themselves from those actively (or passively) supporting barbaric policies and attacks on the rule of law.  Family or not, Fascists should not be coddled or normalized!
761 2018-06-11 22:11:56 P.S if u do see a oil residue on top of water b4 u boil then boil longer at least 10minutes
762 2018-06-11 22:11:45 If we had different markets for our oil we cou,d slow down the flow to down south to make a point but hey there won’t be an oil industry in 50 or 60 years right so why bother  #pnpcbc
763 2018-06-11 22:11:29 @BluewaterPower so any idea why  the power isnout in Oil Springs?
764 2018-06-11 22:11:10 Also, I ordered my coconut oil yesterday and it was said to arrive on Thursday but it came this morning? MUAH, was a blessed day 
765 2018-06-11 22:10:54 I take cannabis oil, but yes, CBD oil is best applied sublingually and held for 15-20 min for maximum absorption
766 2018-06-11 22:10:53 This outcome has to be predetermined...he has to know the outcome. putin said he talks with trump all the time. putin supplies NK oil. Putin set this up with kim. This is all by design to get US military off the peninsula
767 2018-06-11 22:10:44 dog the squash i just made was so fucking good and it was all oil free ugh my mind
768 2018-06-11 22:10:26 You're going to start putting the American worker first? In front of the 1%? Ahead of big oil, big pharma, & the NRA? Your (lack of) trade expertise is hurting US farmers. I understand you want to destroy Obama's legacy. Is ruining the country part of that unholy mission?
769 2018-06-11 22:10:25 Mitch McConnell-"In my view, the last 16 months have been the single, best period for conservative values since I came to Washington." After PBO's Iran Deal, gas & oil prices dropped; Oil and gas prices have risen since Trump reneged on the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. ..
770 2018-06-11 22:10:24 They already have used it as an arguement. Trouble is we needed nothing except conservation and now are saddled with a boondoggle we can’t afford to pay off. Oil went down so our rates would have done the same.
771 2018-06-11 22:10:22 Not just oil prices, but also tax cuts and a weak USD. Weak USD is high oil prices. Clinton ran surpluses and raised taxes, keeping pressure for CAD to rise relatively low.

She snorted, manifesting a knife and cutting the tourniquet off entirely, wrapping a proper one around his arm, liberally dosing it with the light oil, which would numb the limb +
781 2018-06-11 22:09:08 So you are in favor of selling our national parks to oil companies? You don’t care about clean air or water? And you believe the very rich should get huge tax cuts while we cut programs to help children & the elderly? And of course you are in favor of Russia running our country.
782 2018-06-11 22:09:02 Bush didn't intentionally expand the CAD, it just happened because of oil prices, Chinese competition, and the after-effects of Clinton's Strong Dollar policy. In fact, his policy was to lower the dollar to boost exports, and pressure China to strengthen the Yuan. + steel tariffs

806 2018-06-11 22:05:38 She needs to be put in a straitjacket.

808 2018-06-11 22:05:23 Well considering that Xi Jingping and Putin brokered this deal, I guess there's no need for you to focus. I wondered why you stayed silent when they both broke your oil sanction with NK.

810 2018-06-11 22:05:23 Thank you Richie for coming out and helping today. It's really nice to have someone come out and help during the day so I can get my oil changed and my new tires put on.
811 2018-06-11 22:05:08 Twice I have received Canada's provincial invitation for exploratory visit, twice it feels like God is telling me "you are on your own if you go." May be God has refused my wish to relocate abroad so that i can take over all the oil blocks by the time y'all have left. 
812 2018-06-11 22:05:07 now that you're talking about seeds in salad, I always put pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seed and a lil bit of cumin in a pan and roast them without oil and ... it's sO GOOD

828 2018-06-11 22:03:54 Just get soy sauce, sesame oil, tuna and rice. And if you like avocado u can add it
829 2018-06-11 22:03:44 Translation:

2- Iraq stands with Iran
830 2018-06-11 22:03:40 We will get rid of Trump but it’s going to hurt a lot of people. The economy has to crash. He has made every bad move and eventually it will catch up. The G7 move puts us well on the way. If Canada cuts back Oil and electric energy it will hurt us.
831 2018-06-11 22:03:39 What's more likely? Trudeau decides to ditch building oil/gas pipelines or he has the pipelines painted in pride colours?

833 2018-06-11 22:03:25 At the end of the day, either one of them will cost you $300.00 for what amounts to an oil change...but you can’t beat that Teutonic driving experience....

835 2018-06-11 22:03:18 Maybe he drank condemned oil
836 2018-06-11 22:03:04 It's like using oil to clean greasy hands, you know that old tenet of "diplomatic relations between two whackjobs?" 
837 2018-06-11 22:02:50 LOL. Someone doesn't know that US is the world's # 1 producer of oil, eh? Oh yeah, there's Canada, down at # 5. LOL. P.S. You might want to fix your broken caps lock.
838 2018-06-11 22:02:48 And honestly by the time you bought gas and the food and shit on the way and the oil change before you leave you’ve spent more money than hooping on a plane
839 2018-06-11 22:02:40 Peppermint oil is magical! Massage on your temples/neck, or take hot baths with ice packs on your forehead and back of your neck

Tip for parents: spray olive oil and a comb
858 2018-06-11 21:59:30 Me too, hate moaning all the time!  I use CBD oil aswell,  find it really good.
859 2018-06-11 21:59:26 #AAOG : The only company with confirm drill for this summer. fully funded & rig in place.

Looking for 241p/share worth of oil, and current price is 10p (+2300% upside potential)

Low risk Mengo alone worth up to 75p (+650% upside)

862 2018-06-11 21:59:21 Beware the summer succubi draining your energy. Apply plenty of coconut oil before lifting and lift naked for maximum protection
863 2018-06-11 21:59:10 This is a crazy  world-most weekdays you can walk down my local high street & will walk through a cloud of “wacky baccy”, police chose to ignore it. A woman tries to bring in an oil containing traces of cannabis which has been prescribed to her very ill son but it is confiscated.
864 2018-06-11 21:58:58 You’re a huckster and a snake oil salesman.
865 2018-06-11 21:58:17 Nice idea man..u should volunteer I think
866 2018-06-11 21:58:14 Today my car is getting an oil change 

On Friday my soul will be getting an Ohel change
867 2018-06-11 21:58:10 i consumed brominated vegetable oil 3 days straight so basically im gonna die 
868 2018-06-11 21:58:09 You also gotta watch what you eat too. Greasy stuff, sodas, junk food etc. And your stress levels will show in your skin too if you not relaxing enough. Invest in some beard balm and vitamin E oil too.
869 2018-06-11 21:58:07 With summer and festival season approaching, it’s about time I gave you some summer hair tips! First, my top product recommendation: serum or argan oil to keep hair nourished, shiny and frizz-free. RW

875 2018-06-11 21:57:14 Stormy weather raging outside
Flooding fields whipping branches
Thunderous lullabye
Flickering old oil lamp
In hand and at the ready
Should calamity strike
And darkness prevail
This time no one prepares
For the absence of dawn
There is no ark
No pitter patter
Of tiny paws.#vss365
876 2018-06-11 21:57:02 Really? Obama created ISIS, Trump defeated them. Obama’s economy was stagnant for 8 years, Trump’s economy is booming. Obama signed the Iran deal that would’ve led to war in Syria, Trump ended it. Obama harmed the oil and coal industry, destroying the lives of thousands, etc, etc
877 2018-06-11 21:56:47 When wages go up so does cost of living & we’d be having the same conversation again. Wage rise is only part of the equation. Government & politicians not selling us out to big energy & big oil would be a start. I mean both Labor & the LNP.
878 2018-06-11 21:56:40 If your coconut oil turns foamy and bubbles when you're cooking that just means the heat is too high. Coconut oil has a "lower-heat" cookability. I use it to "wet" my food but not to cook with it.

880 2018-06-11 21:56:13 Brent you make great points, a strong economy today requires oil. Hope it is transported safely to mitigate impacts.

885 2018-06-11 21:55:19 Honestly? If it wasn’t for North Sea oil, Norway would be in the shit and the Swiss have always been able to make money...
886 2018-06-11 21:55:14 No. I'm for ALL people. Not just pandering to the edges of civilization with outdated, regressive or un-needed talking points. Nothing Ford said spoke to me as to me he was just a wolf selling snake oil
887 2018-06-11 21:55:10 omg why why do people protest about palm oil or the fur/leather industry if they still eat meat??!!? dude your lifestyle is far more damaging pls pls pls be more self aware
888 2018-06-11 21:55:05 @tobyfoster CBD oil IS legal in the UK and is readily available at Holland and Barrett - we've just bought some for our dog

894 2018-06-11 21:54:11 Toss in Olive oil pepper salt and other ground seasoning of your choice is delicious can’t go wrong
895 2018-06-11 21:53:58 Thankyou for writing such insightful work. I still completely amazed the lengths humans will go to, to continue lying to themselves and collecting a few precious dollars that will be so insignificant in the long term. The oil industry and all its bloat is beyond rotting.

897 2018-06-11 21:53:52 Disposable pens always run out of battery before they run out of oil 
898 2018-06-11 21:53:35 Taking vitamin b complex and fish oil/omega-3 definitely helped to balance my chemistry.  Along with addressing and healing my heart, obviously.  But having the right nutrients definitely plays a huge role in a healthy mind.  
899 2018-06-11 21:53:26 No  grasshopper, that sludge would be coming from that Saudi oil you import over there, since your dip shit Mayor Codere helped to kill the pipeline which would have transported oil from Alberta safely thru to Quebec and beyond. But that would make too much sense for u lefties!
900 2018-06-11 21:53:17 I've thought about getting one of those damn essential oil smoker diffusers things to substitute smoking cigs just as something to do but I think I'd just end up wasting my money 
901 2018-06-11 21:53:12 pakai bio oil
902 2018-06-11 21:53:10 most people keep like money and chapstick in their wallet. i currently have two essential oil roller balls and a prescription for oxygen. 
903 2018-06-11 21:53:02 thanks I’ll try that! I’m all about the organic approach, diatomaceous earth and neem oil are my go-tos, but with all this damn rain...
904 2018-06-11 21:53:02 Hi iman. I ada baca mineral oil not good for our skin bcs it can damage skin barrier and increase water loss. Tapi most of the cleansing oil, mineral oil tu first ingredient. I baru nak try banila co tu tapi dia ada mineral oil kan? What do you think?
905 2018-06-11 21:52:49 Restaurants really need to post if they cook with peanut oil on their doors
906 2018-06-11 21:52:47 @georganicsuk I just bought your tooth soap stick. I was really happy till I realised it has palm oil in it. Do you or are you going to use a substitute sewing as the damage palm oil is doing to the rainforest is enormous?
907 2018-06-11 21:52:44 TA guys much like snake oil salesmen and weather forecasters.  Random success based only on probability
908 2018-06-11 21:52:42 Essential oil diffuser with citrus scents like lemongrass and sweet orange and reflexology moves on your hands!!
909 2018-06-11 21:52:28 I barbecue them. I mix olive oil, paprika, chilli powder, salt,pepper and basil. Then some lemon juice on top when all done.
910 2018-06-11 21:52:22 speculations-fake news. we the ppl want real news: such as jobs, jobs, jobs; more jobs than workers; or usa being #1 in oil production, etc. will such interesting news that we the ppl care abt continue? these r real news we the ppl r interested in, not negative fake news.
911 2018-06-11 21:52:20 @LizMacDonaldFOX I agree with Navarro. That was a passive aggressive assault by a useless Canuck. Let those hoity-toity globalists try to survive without the US. I say put a 50% tariff on those arrogant rascals oil and everything else. Embargo Canuck lumber, steel and aluminum.
912 2018-06-11 21:52:13 Purple punch good strain for sleep #420 with my oil and this 
913 2018-06-11 21:51:56 Not too thrilled with his his stance on big oil. Come on Mike, you know he's a neoliberal.
914 2018-06-11 21:51:29 Justin’s Honey or Maple Almond butter is my  I’m using Avocado Oil a lot and if you like coconut you can roll with MCT Oil too to help keep you in ketosis. We’ve replaced all pasta with zucchini and squash spiralized and on pizza nights just eat mostly toppings lol

This gloss is a great moisturizer for your  
919 2018-06-11 21:51:07 No because the oil change actually took 30 minutes. SMDH
920 2018-06-11 21:50:57 Doing an oil change under 10mins is pure satisfaction
921 2018-06-11 21:50:56 There are carve-outs from NAFTA on both sides based on what each country wanted to protect (e.g. certain susbsidy and quota programs, like dairy for both countries). Longitudinal analysis just gives a better measure over time (reduces effects of things like the oil price in '16).
922 2018-06-11 21:50:51 When they fit you in for an oil change 
923 2018-06-11 21:50:45 Oil change 
924 2018-06-11 21:50:33 The enemy of my enemy is my friend... or something luke that! JK I believe we all have always cared for Canadians. I don't like Trudeau's approving oil pipelines, but that is his only black mark that I can see.
925 2018-06-11 21:50:22 Spraying peppermint oil round your room like you would when your throwing sage round your room to get rid of negative energy, so I can keep the spiders away!! Haven’t been able to wee in peace today thanks to two different spiders  #isitautumnyet
926 2018-06-11 21:50:16 Maybe they meant "No, MORE baby oil!"
927 2018-06-11 21:50:09 I love the positivity people bring to us when they actually start believing in the weight loss program and our CBD Oil. It's honestly revitalizing and it keeps me going, knowing I'll be helping anyone who decides they want to be helped.

928 2018-06-11 21:50:08 Also,rapeseed oil has only 50% of the saturated fat of olive oil. Jam that up your ‘pure extra virgin *_~! And rotate!

932 2018-06-11 21:49:36 ABSOLUTELY!! Grapeseed oil should be a staple in your pantry.
I cook almost EXCLUSIVELY with it. Coconut oil and othets don't see the light of day in my kitchen. Nope. 
Grapeseed oil...YEP!!
933 2018-06-11 21:49:34 Plus, to REALLY rile the weak minded "alpha" mindset, Spartans took time to oil and dress one another's beard and hair.

Because...

Well, just because, I guess, but they friggin DID 
934 2018-06-11 21:49:27 who needs highlighter when you have that ~natural oil~
935 2018-06-11 21:49:24 Up Yours, Big Oil.  Modern life depends on it now, but if we want to win as a civilizatiin we are going to have to move on to more sustainable models.  We can use our big brains to figure that out.  Be part of the solution, or die a slow death.  You can't stop progress forever.

937 2018-06-11 21:49:18 Agreed!! Ball is a flash in the pan, maybe not even that. Magic & the Lakers got conned by a snake oil salesman named LaVar Ball!!! Kuzma really gave 100% last season & received little media attention until the end

942 2018-06-11 21:48:51 Many years ago I did oil painting reproductions of Old Masters: Delacroix and Joshua Reynolds: Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi and The Little Birds Nester. So I know your love of history.
943 2018-06-11 21:48:45 Give me salads, olive oil, olives, tomatoes and I am good. I really don't even care for meat that much anymore. It is better to have it only on certain days, such as Sunday dinner.
944 2018-06-11 21:48:23 Can someone buy me a wax burner or an essential oil diffuser
945 2018-06-11 21:48:14 Repealed anti-bribery rule to the delight of the oil industry.
Ripped off American taxpayers and avoided fixing the broken federal coal-leasing program.
But, you of course, know nothing about this because Fox didnt tell you.
946 2018-06-11 21:48:11 Thank you but I do not have the receipt. I just will never buy Beauty360 products again. Alpha Keri. Keri. CVS Body oil. It was effective until B360. 42 yrs I've used this but no more.

950 2018-06-11 21:47:49 Yes, we stand together against bullies, just not quite enough to, say, get an oil pipeline built that might actually allow us to sell to other countries.

956 2018-06-11 21:47:22 Arm chair quarterbacks try to discredit Kobe. They love advanced analytics and I’m pretty sure they drink deep fryer oil but I’m not too sure on that last one...but like 90% sure.  #KobeSlanderNotTolerated

959 2018-06-11 21:47:13 Trump needs to STFU and until he does, cut off all oil exports and electricity to the USA.  Close our borders and stop them from entering. Stop buying made in the USA.

961 2018-06-11 21:47:11 Driving is expensive and not worth it
I pay $500 a month for my car
I had to pay like $60 a few months ago to renew my license plate
Had to pay $74 for an oil change
Now I gotta pay $34 to renew my driver's license

Just... ugh take the fucking bus or something lmao.
962 2018-06-11 21:46:58 Haven't you wondered just a little bit how your Chavista mates got so rich Ken? Go home gringo slogans sound a bit old now Russia and China own most of the oil, and your  buddies like Diosdado, Tarek and Andrade have millions of USD stolen from the starving.

973 2018-06-11 21:45:49 By the way, @AnaSwanson doing an outstanding job covering the international trade beat, which arguably hasn't seen this much action since Nixon imposed his import surcharge and OPEC its oil embargo.
974 2018-06-11 21:45:48 it just sounds like the price of gas in a lot of expensive countries already? I know it's not necessarily auto fuel. Last time I read about this stuff the plan was turkey parts into crude oil!
975 2018-06-11 21:45:37 What about butter, olive oil and coconut oil?
976 2018-06-11 21:45:36 41% of total U.S. crude oil imports come from Canada.  50% of US Electricity comes from coal. Cut off oil and electricity to the USA.  Screw them.
977 2018-06-11 21:45:35 Is there an essential oil that will make me smarter? Asking for me
978 2018-06-11 21:45:25 1) coal and oil paid the better bribes than solar. 2) trump knows nothing but also refuses to learn. Al Gore, Schwarzenegger and the economic counsel tried to explain solar benefits to Trump. The poor decisions of this president will haunt US for years on so many issues.

Well of course he can, being a five year old one of his catchphrases is "takes one to know one"
986 2018-06-11 21:44:07 Guess you dont remember the Clinton oil deal..

998 2018-06-11 21:42:29 Sadly the diminishing supply of whale oil and the discovery of the use of crude oil are actually what mostly led to the end of the whaling industry. I would like to say that it was people changing their minds but really it was supply and demand. Additional regulations helped also
999 2018-06-11 21:42:23 I need to get back to Oil Cleansing. That’s when my skin looks best

1002 2018-06-11 21:42:13 J.P Morgan owned GE and Rottweiler owned Standard oil Company, the mother company to Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and many more energy companies. It's just a clue how Rottweiler still running US economy.

Which might indeed become truth , Indy is when Scotland is no longer parasited in return for the English Offices of Labour , Tories and libdems , ermine and oil.

1009 2018-06-11 21:41:12 If you're selling oil & your major trading partners for that soon-to-be worldwide devalued commodity are N. Korea, Iran, Syria and Crimea, you probably don't have much of a market. Now, if you had control over the Republican party...
1010 2018-06-11 21:41:08 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1011 2018-06-11 21:41:07 do noodles, veggies, butter and oil. it's good!

1016 2018-06-11 21:40:52 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1017 2018-06-11 21:40:46 We need to put as little investment into Scotland as possible. Let Scotland follow their own route buoyed up with a short term increase  in oil price !!  let's them and Nicola get on with independence clearly they have a had a few dram too many !!
1018 2018-06-11 21:40:41 You gotta watch the film “All the Money in the World”, about John Paul Getty and his oil empire.  It shows who runs the world and what rotten scumbags they are.

1026 2018-06-11 21:39:25 Most Americans would not be able to afford exclusively US-made products. Then, there is the scarcity of certain resources like oil which American business find cheaper from other countries.  So, explain how you would make this work.
1027 2018-06-11 21:39:22 AND THE OIL
1028 2018-06-11 21:39:21 Fried chicken always tastes better with used oil and flour

1032 2018-06-11 21:38:16 This showcases product developers' approach to 'low fat' while trying to keep palatable REACH FOR SUGAR !!
The product has to comprise something !
- If 25-50% fat/ oil is removed: what do you replace it with?
- If not sugar directly then sugar sources like grape juice extract

1036 2018-06-11 21:37:27 I don’t think being rich is our problem really, I believe it’s actually gross mismanagement of the little we have. We don’t need to be competing with oil rich countries, we just need to be the best in managing our resources.

1041 2018-06-11 21:36:52 @Google @facebook @Twitter @amazon are monopolies far beyond what Standard Oil was before it was broken up. These companies should either stop censoring or be regulated in some fashion.  They have become the gatekeepers of the internet. They control what you see&read.

1056 2018-06-11 21:34:57 Fascinating.I wonder if that'll last with resources industry,especially oil& gas,being held back by regulations&roadblocks by govts&rnvironmental groups.Also Ontario's manufacturing has been hard hit by energy prices.Hopefully Ont will be "open for business" soon with new govt
1057 2018-06-11 21:34:45 I have to make my quarter tank of gas last until Friday but first I have to fix my brakes, get an oil change, and buy new tires

1060 2018-06-11 21:34:29 I think there is a global something pulling strings. Not Jewish people, but oil executives and defense contractors.

1062 2018-06-11 21:34:17 Oh, I love mushrooms and those look yummy! I’ve never used grape seed oil before. Does it go particularly well with mushrooms?
1063 2018-06-11 21:34:15 The best Mathematician i know is my friend and brother @jon_teye but only if he hadn't taken/drunk any crude oil, and he wouldn't even know that his phone is ringing.

1073 2018-06-11 21:31:55 @DineshDSouza asking if 'we' (him, Trump and his ilk) can save America a second time is like oil asking if it can put out a bonfire.
1074 2018-06-11 21:31:33 I just realized that I haven't had a migraine since I got my essential oil diffuser . Peppermint & lemongrass during the day & lavender & cedarwood at night. I also add a few grops of tea tree oil to clean the air. I'm almost out of peppermint. :(

1076 2018-06-11 21:31:11 While its not a perfect solution you can grow two plants without too much hassle you can then synthesize the oil from the plants. You can also do this with vaping. Not suggesting anyone break the law. #justsaying
1077 2018-06-11 21:31:03 The government of Papua New Guinea has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Henry Cavill in a gazar wig.

1083 2018-06-11 21:30:10 That's a one year change, when oil prices were normalizing from very low levels. The goods trade deficit is 3% of total goods trade. $73 billion in mineral fuels (oil & gas); say that increased by $10B, and it's easily a 60% increase in deficit.

1093 2018-06-11 21:29:17 This GOP leadership chooses oblivion .
They ignore/discredit experts on climate, air and water quality and are dismantling programs to evaluate changes caused by their policies. They do not want environmental costs to effect big business, especially big oil, profit margins.Greed.

1109 2018-06-11 21:26:35 Israel is the key to military superiority in the Middle East and is effectively an American outpost and first responder to missile intercept any nukes launched from the region. It establishes control over Euro-Mediterranean waters, and secures American Oil interests.
1110 2018-06-11 21:26:35 Finally changed my dammn oil
1111 2018-06-11 21:26:32 Don't forget that the Southeast is in darkness for over decades and that in IMO state, the two oil producing LGAs are in total blackout since 2015. Tell the @MBuhari that.
1112 2018-06-11 21:26:20 I know!! It gonna be so hard lol. I already got a serum and some oil but my birthday’s coming up, so it’s really tempting to get the extensions 
1113 2018-06-11 21:26:16 Liberals like Mandy don't put healthcare expenses at the top of their priority list.  Travel, CellPhone, Designer Shit, Starbucks.  She was seriously expecting that she would NEVER have to pay out of pocket.  For bill to go to collections, she has been IGNORING it for months.
1114 2018-06-11 21:26:16 No. Read labels carefully. You can also Google "Plam oil free products" to find who/what doesn't use ot in their products.
1115 2018-06-11 21:26:10 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in
the same oil, at the same time and under the same
heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the
same time..My friend, never compete with anyone
in your life ,your time will come.

1119 2018-06-11 21:25:31 I took 4 socks in progress for an oil change. Knit on one
1120 2018-06-11 21:25:24 I heard Castor oil is bow wow 
1121 2018-06-11 21:25:23 Would even work as a 40x60" oil painting!
1122 2018-06-11 21:25:15 In all seriousness, the single biggest mistake with regards to guaranteeing Canadian energy security was the sale by the Conservatives in 1990 of Petro Canada. A state owned oil concern would have gone a long way towards securing our supply. Perfect example: Statoil, Norway.
1123 2018-06-11 21:25:08 And a ton of krill oil
1124 2018-06-11 21:24:54 ok FUCK CARS FUCK OIL FUCK ALL THIS
1125 2018-06-11 21:24:51 Olive oil?
1126 2018-06-11 21:24:37 Oil is traded in $s so doesn’t help support value of bolivar.
1127 2018-06-11 21:24:31 The woman with the epileptic child on cannabis oil........why doesn’t she turn to Jesus as this was a demon he would caste out on a regular basis. Why doesn’t she take him to a bishop, to healing rooms, a pastor, a vicar.........
1128 2018-06-11 21:24:20 Watching this mum with her epileptic son, being stopped from taking cannabis oil because British authorities say there's no medical benefit.

Ah, the UK and its wonderful medical guidelines.
1129 2018-06-11 21:24:12 In 1929, the farmers of Louisiana produced $180M in crops. Standard Oil sold $216M worth of oil from Baton Rouge. Nevertheless, the farmers paid 40 times more taxes than Standard.
1130 2018-06-11 21:23:59 You ain’t sayin shit slick to a can of oil
1131 2018-06-11 21:23:53 An extra note not picked up by the media & shameful to us as Canadians as well - Mrs Calswell is also in violation of the current CDSA & #ACMPR regulations in her action of exporting CBD oil from Canada

1134 2018-06-11 21:23:30 Iman I dah try simple pnya oil cleanser tapi lepas pakai mesti keluar bintik2 merah. So tak sesuai la kan?
1135 2018-06-11 21:23:26 I don't understand the ignorance of some people. They think oil prices went up only in South Africa, and that we're the only developing country with an unstable currency. The they tweet crap.
1136 2018-06-11 21:23:24 Wait please explain. What is cbd oil or its other names?
1137 2018-06-11 21:23:20 Be careful what you wish for .... oil for gas... comes from Canada. Lumber, wheat, corn. Many other items.   Electrical power from Canadian niagra falls.
1138 2018-06-11 21:23:19 Why is cannabis oil banned when it’s known to help those who need it ??
1139 2018-06-11 21:23:10 My tanning oil smells like Malibu so every time I’m at the pool I have to relive poor choices.

1142 2018-06-11 21:22:54 The Rockefellers haven't been majority owners of any oil companies in decades. They own shares, but the largest oil companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil are held by financial institutions and company insiders.

1144 2018-06-11 21:22:30 For many years, my now long-gone aunt, who was a real-estate agent in Beverly Hills, had an apartment or condo in a Century City high rise from which you could see that oil derrick.

1149 2018-06-11 21:21:55 @realDonaldTrump is an experienced con man and knows exactly what to say to deceive people. In the old days, they used to call people like Trump "snake oil salesmen".
1150 2018-06-11 21:21:55 So you become olive oil?
1151 2018-06-11 21:21:49 Rub some baby oil into it. Seems to get off other stuff like wax.

Put it in a bowl, stir. Sub bell pepper for carrot if Mikey's not around.

1158 2018-06-11 21:21:00 Imagine being such a con man that you use the wealth accrued from the front of solving global reliance on crude oil to launch random objects into space and mass produce flamethrowers.
1159 2018-06-11 21:20:55 And we are using strong economic sanctions and driving the price of oil, Russia's #1 income, to historic lows to cripple Russia which has been surprisingly effective. Russias GDP is now half that of California, they are badly screwed.

1167 2018-06-11 21:19:39 Looks like Trump does not believe STEO data that there is no shortage of oil. Interesting to see OPEC and STEO reports to see what they say.
1168 2018-06-11 21:19:39 Maybe she takes a lot of fish oil pills with the half a million other supplement pulks she takes and now she just sweats oil?
1169 2018-06-11 21:19:36 Why do we have to be the world cops? Like the oil wars against Iraq and now were stuck in a never ending war.

1173 2018-06-11 21:19:01 I was just thinking how sitting here getting my oil changed at the car service center was exhausting cause someone sat right next to me, even when there were a ton of seats available all around. They tried talking to me...I survived tho cause they had a puppy

1183 2018-06-11 21:18:18 Not true for the oil & gas industry squirrel. BC, QC have made it so another pipeline built to the coast is nearly impossible. Canadians are NOT backing AB & Sask, and it’s costing all of CANADA billions/year. Price differential last week was $25/barrel. The US gets it, we lose.

They have the mechanism to grant a special exemption for Canadian CBD oil products from #ACMPR

I would think they also have an avenue for access to domestically produced Epidiolex, once it achieves FDA approval

My bad habit formed when I was working in the oil rigs in Alberta. I would work for 5-6 months on shutdown, get fit, come home for 6-8 months gain some weight but then I’d always go back and get fit. 8 years lol

But for last 6 years full time streaming need good habits

1260 2018-06-11 21:07:23 Everyone wants his Tweets RTd. Your picture does more to get most interested. I like the object of your motivation,saying as friend. If you'd gotten few.. @democracynow today at :08 The Pope declared... He had invited top Oil Execs (in attendance) to hear him beg them to stop FF.

1262 2018-06-11 21:07:10 Nigeria doesn't need oil revenue to meet its budget commitments. Nigeria has no business borrowing funds for anything???
1263 2018-06-11 21:06:58 Well here's an upsetting fact for all of you. Most of the presidents (even Obama) have watched over democratic states being overturned by CIA/FBI for DECADES so that they can install dictators that help them pillage for Oil and more War.

1265 2018-06-11 21:06:50 Wow. You are SO misguided! Clinton News Network much?!  Lol!  Your Kenyan is the poster child of a Snake oil salesman.  Lying community organizer had secret side deals with Iran nuclear inspections and did NOT go through Congress.  Then sent them $1.3 billion in cash.  1 example!

1269 2018-06-11 21:06:20 Ang galing ni Sotto sa WW2 history. Let me educate you Senator. Japan has a Grand Design of occupying the whole of Asia, while ally Germany will occupy Europe. Japan has already occupied most of China and is eyeing the whole Asia because of lack of Oil.
1270 2018-06-11 21:06:16 The mechanics doing my oil change should be proud of me. I only waited until I was 600 miles over the mileage they told me to get an oil change instead of the 1000+ like last time

1277 2018-06-11 21:05:33 Tell me, @TheOilPalm, what‘s your argument agains a ban of non-sustainable palm oil - and only non-sustainable palm oil? Or would you even advocate for this?
1278 2018-06-11 21:05:30 Pierogies - fried in oil or boiled in water?

Tbh I hate boiled ones, I don’t like the texture

1280 2018-06-11 21:05:19 I love shopping with my kids and teaching them about food. My son selects extra virgin olive oil instead of refined and I ask him if he knows the difference. He says, “virgin means the olive hasn’t been touched by another olive?” omggg
1281 2018-06-11 21:04:48 Protests s3rve a purpose. But no one is stupid enough to think that these people will shut the economy down.

Except people like Kenney, who use fear to drive his agenda. The oil hasn't stopped flowing, and it won't.
1282 2018-06-11 21:04:46 getting my oil changed like a big girl :3
1283 2018-06-11 21:04:34 Don't you think it rather odd that largest oil companies in the world are owned by the Rockefellers who Canada depends on for oil when we can't rely on our on resources due to shut down. This is not about climate change, but about profits.
1284 2018-06-11 21:04:31 If it goes with butter, olive oil and season salt, then probably so!
1285 2018-06-11 21:04:18 3) I think it's important to differentiate between using oil to make things (plastic parts), vs burning it and making more GHG emissions.  If there's something EV&renewable fans want to push back on, it's the burning.

4) 125 MPGe in a model 3... what gas car hits that level?
1286 2018-06-11 21:04:14 1tbsp turmeric, 1tbsp honey 1tbsp brown sugar.. add a little bit of coconut oil and water, then mix .u can use a cotton pad or ur clean hands and apply evenly on ur face.. leave for 15mins.. then wash off with water and soap to remove the turmeric colour completely from ur face
1287 2018-06-11 21:03:53 It’s so embarrassing watching our leader.   I would switch in a heartbeat for trump.  Complete ass backwards here, resource nation like Canada and morons fight it, when the oil companies leave who is Treadue gonna get the next $400m to send overseas #peoplekind 
1288 2018-06-11 21:03:48 She’s not good at selling snake oil.

1291 2018-06-11 21:03:20 

I'm sorry...i respect their right to protest, even agree in some respects, but none of them are going to shut down our economy. Pragmatically speaking, I will be long dead before the need of oil to drive the planet will dissipate.
1292 2018-06-11 21:03:11 P.S LOVE THE SHOW and to set your mind at rest. FRYUPS ARE GOOD FOR YOU afterall they are cooked in healthy vegetable oil. oh yea forget the swimming, its not good for your figure. you only need to look at a whale !!

1296 2018-06-11 21:02:46 Did you ever consider that Trump is doing this to benefit Saudi Arabian, Russian, and US oil interests (all of whom are paying Trump) ? Trump doesn't give a F*ck about the Venezuelan people AND if you are in the US you better watch out for ICE if you are from Venezuela.
1297 2018-06-11 21:02:41 This is not something to celebrate. These are usually tiny start-ups. Subsidies related to staff, mechanization and marketing can give them a chance.  The subsidies should decline over time as they become more established. Are you also advocating and end to oil Co.  subsidies.
1298 2018-06-11 21:02:31 Estava em dúvida entre pintar meu cabelo de em padrão oil slick ou ruivo de novo, estabeleci a meta pessoal de que se visse 5 pessoas com o cabelo colorido ou 5 ruivas, esse seria o determinante pra eu escolher a próxima cor. Até o momento 4 ruivxs
1299 2018-06-11 21:02:28 Context. How about American subsidies to oil, cotton & tobacco? Trade and tariffs are complex issues, singling out an item misrepresents the market.
1300 2018-06-11 21:02:25 The market "oil cartels" control the price of oil at the pumps you tools.

1302 2018-06-11 21:02:10 As Trump eschews the need for a science advisor, the Pope lectures oil execs on the need to address climate change. The Catholic Church has greater regard for science than the US government. What would Galileo say?
1303 2018-06-11 21:02:06 Goebbels was a propaganda lightweight compared to the seed oil sponsors of the #AHA.
How do you reckon Nuremberg feels about trying the heads of certain organizations for nutritional crimes against humanity?
1304 2018-06-11 21:01:52 OIL....
1305 2018-06-11 21:01:26 I can answer the grass thing. Grass itches because the blades create  teeny tiny cuts on the top layer of your skin. You can roll around in  poison ivy because not everyone is allergic to the oil it's coated in  that causes rash and swelling.
1306 2018-06-11 21:01:13 isn’t it cool how smells take you back to memories like bitch i’m in england but my body oil got me in south america
1307 2018-06-11 21:01:08 Maybe we stop supplying oil, soft wood lumber, dairy and electrical power to the US. See how that feels. State of New York gets tons of power from your neighbour to the north. Think before you build walls! Don’t talk dumb.
1308 2018-06-11 21:01:05 @mrsMAZELEE help..what   coconut oil do you use for your family...was at the doctor today and the hospital runs a health channel..saw the benefits of the oil and remembered you!
1309 2018-06-11 21:00:48 Changing my brakes & oil outside and it starts pouring out of nowhere
1310 2018-06-11 21:00:45 Back to squeaking, like an engine is running off to my left that needs oil on a bearing.

1319 2018-06-11 21:00:02 For once in their lives do the right thing, this kid needs the oil to help his life, Jesus Christ what is wrong with these people.
1320 2018-06-11 20:59:35 The chicken isn't the problem, the way it's done is. Put it in the oven instead than in the oil bath.
1321 2018-06-11 20:59:18 Saudis are running their oil welfare train into the ground. And he realizes that the key to peace in the Middle East, is by working WITH progressive leaders... who want change.
1322 2018-06-11 20:59:17 Entitlements?  Like the subsidies we still pay to Big Oil - some of the wealthiest old white men in the country??  Like that??
1323 2018-06-11 20:59:04 #A1 J75 Northbound Exit. All lanes have now reopened following the earlier LGV breakdown & oil spillage.
1324 2018-06-11 20:59:03 @elonmusk If your idea of helping to save the world by exchanging our oil and gas into electric I hope you're prepared for a Solar flare or a EMP that will stop all circuits from happening. That is the next big idea in my opinion. The Electric Shield is a great name.
1325 2018-06-11 20:58:41 Aye Aye indeed #GoNavy #TilleyHat still wears the Kuwaiti oil smoke tinge,so not quite white 
1326 2018-06-11 20:58:17 dont worry, as long as your oil is full... you are okay...
1327 2018-06-11 20:58:15 True, from a rail industry leading working safety culture, to incorporating the 'don't walk by' culture of the oil and gas industry.

1329 2018-06-11 20:56:48 The idea is that all nations are controlled by a few multi multi billionaires whom control all world affairs and have been using NK and Iran to stoke worldwide tensions and keep the defense contractors, oil companies and various other conglomerates rich.
1330 2018-06-11 20:56:26 @SecretaryZinke Obviously this is a good thing.Nothing to do with Mr Zinke &#45 so we appreciate you not trying to take credit.  61 million is great.  But isn’t that just a drop in the bucket of what the oil companies make in profits? Can’t we get better, not more, lease rates?
1331 2018-06-11 20:56:08 Palm oil should be banned and outlawed worldwide
1332 2018-06-11 20:56:03 Obtížný hmyz a různá lezoucí havěť prý nesnáší tea tree oil.

1336 2018-06-11 20:54:59 We may have strategically protected oil supplies but have never stolen natural resources.  The reformed government of Iraq was allowed to sell oil on the world market.

1342 2018-06-11 20:54:37 Is it the Jamaican black castor oil , or regular ? 
1343 2018-06-11 20:54:37 Working on that now. I’ve had oil but never used it. Learned the hard way that I was ruining my beard the whole time lol
1344 2018-06-11 20:54:34 but oil based ugh
1345 2018-06-11 20:54:33 "cooking is really an art form, a balance of flavor" i say directly into the camera while pouring an entire bottle of canola oil into a wine glass "and technique"
1346 2018-06-11 20:53:52 Castor oil on these edges every SINGLE day. I need every strand I got.

1349 2018-06-11 20:53:42 about 90% positive there’s tanning oil in my veins at this point
1350 2018-06-11 20:53:40 I’ve been on #accutane for two weeks now. The only side effect I’ve had so far is DRY SKIN. Literally as soon as I step out of the shower, I have to run for my face oil 
1351 2018-06-11 20:53:39 Some of these lot are a proper unhealthy colour , slathering the cooking oil on like my grandad used too back in the day #LoveIsland
1352 2018-06-11 20:53:37 We provide you the majority of your oil at lower cost to you than us. Plus a lot of other products you need. The USA needs Canada a lot more than they'd like to believe.
1353 2018-06-11 20:53:34 @HondaCanada when you going to make customers aware of the oil dilution issue with the CRV and Civics? Or you just going to keep trapping customers into loans with disclosing? #hondacanada #oildilution #hondacivic #hondacrv

1356 2018-06-11 20:53:14 My skin in so dry right now where I’m peeling but guess what the amount of oil it’s about to get 
1357 2018-06-11 20:53:14 On the plus side, you know she puts out.
1358 2018-06-11 20:53:02 I would suggest investing in oil, gas and consumer goods companies. Just a suggestion.

1361 2018-06-11 20:52:37 I don’t think she gives her son spliffs .... CBD (the oil) is not psychoactive. It is used medicinally in many parts of the US and Canada .... will be in the UK soon, I hope.

1363 2018-06-11 20:52:32 It is imperative that @JustinTrudeau @PMJustinTrudeau impose $ for $ tariffs to counter the tariffs imposed & to be imposed by the South Moron. If we have to sacrifice we will. @JustinTrudeau @PMJustinTrudeau we have your back.  Oil & electricity Cad tariffs must be on the table
1364 2018-06-11 20:52:30 No one expects a buildings to be covered in material that has crude oil particles in it. I’m not a chemist but grew up in Aberdeen and you get taught enough about crude to know it’s flammable. It’s corporate manslaughter.
1365 2018-06-11 20:52:27 How about we keep our oil. States has none. And what about energy from us too. We can shut the valve off. I'm so sick of people (trump) thinking we suck. We will stand tall!
1366 2018-06-11 20:52:03 @RaceSelinsgrove didn’t go as well as planned car was good in the feature. Started 16th was up to 13th in four laps but blew an oil line.
1367 2018-06-11 20:51:58 But you did stoop to his "level". Listen, why don't you just be open about who and what you are? Essentially, you're an anti-white, anti-American, Hegelian intellectual who despises morals and the individual. There. Now doesn't that feel good? me = not white, for the record.

1375 2018-06-11 20:51:03 @JustinTrudeau 
When do you mention that our oil is going to the USA for $30 a barrel????????????
1376 2018-06-11 20:50:59 I’ve been meaning to try jojoba but yeah i heard tea tree oil is great for facial hair but obvi i don’t know lmao. But yes good for piercings too! I also hear coconut oil is good for longer eyelashes. I used to put it on my lashes before bed
1377 2018-06-11 20:50:51 Even if you are correct, in the end, he was stopped in his athletic prime by a small 40 yr old man, who he outweighed by 20 pounds and hadn't fought for over two years.  Reality is, they were selling snake oil, and people bought it by the Barrel full.
1378 2018-06-11 20:50:43 This was actually an experiment with latex with polyacrylic over that. The problem with water based is that it requires 2-4 weeks to cure opposed to a week for oil based
1379 2018-06-11 20:50:37 The reason is that is has become so expensive to make the oil now, because equipment costs, property costs, taxes and local and state fees, lack of new refineries to keep up with with production capacity thus creating overtime worker expenses, etc. Also market prices,
1380 2018-06-11 20:50:30 I live in the jungle! A spray bottle, a 2dlr pack of cloves, some baby oil and rubbing alcohol. All you really need XD
1381 2018-06-11 20:50:26 Whatchu mean "fresh"? OF COURSE THEY'RE FRESH!!! and those "Cajun" fries? Please! It's peanut oil and they soggy AF! #InNOut
1382 2018-06-11 20:50:23 So he agrees with some,but Russia isn't thrilled about lots of what he does. Oil &natural gas make up nearly 70%. Do you think they r thrilled about opening up Alaska for oil? Reversal of Obama era energy & environmental regulations? Coal production? Would Hillary have done that?

1392 2018-06-11 20:49:26 COCONUT OIL SKIN RUB:
• 2 Tbsp coconut oil
• 2 Tbsp sugar/brown sugar
It may be semisolid as you make a paste with the sugar, but melts into a liquid with the heat from the skin. Rub on with a circular motion before or after a bath. Wipe off and rinse with water.

1396 2018-06-11 20:48:33 We sell you oil way cheaper cost than ourselves. I pay double what you pay for gas. It should not cost $80 to fill my 2003 Toyota Corolla. That's not "fair trade".
1397 2018-06-11 20:48:12 I feel like my car always needs an oil change
1398 2018-06-11 20:48:09 But the focus is already shifting from oil. Other sectors are growing.

1415 2018-06-11 20:45:02 I’ve never used it but i hear it’s good! They say it closely resembles sebum, the skin’s natural oil that moisturizes which is good.

1434 2018-06-11 20:42:41 Do you realize the iPhone allows one to make a 911 call without relying on the fingerprint reader or passcode?

Why is that?

1. So anyone can make quick 911 call - I.e. all of my family can use gun
2. So you don’t get locked out of phone when emergency happens - I.e. gun works!

Let's not mention the $165B contribution to the Nat' debt when oil revenues  were double what they are now

1473 2018-06-11 20:38:32 Sometimes being a girl is super weird. Like just now, I put oil on one end of my hair and powder to a absorb oil on the other end.
1474 2018-06-11 20:38:30 Except rare earths. You're as dependant of China for that as with everything else. 
I'm also quite sure you need the Canadian timber. And their oil probably helps yours.
1475 2018-06-11 20:38:23 Well stated.
But not too me.
$ is useful as a resource, but it's petty & meaningless to me.
They're all just oil printed systemized rectangular papers.
The agreement of how much each piece is worth /$1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100) is consensual.
1476 2018-06-11 20:38:14 Coconut oil has a lot of saturated fats which is good for repairing skin and a lot of anti microbial properties. However, it is one of the highest rated comodogenic oils (meaning it clogs pores and can subsequently lead to break outs) so it’s good but it can be bad! Just be aware
1477 2018-06-11 20:38:06 When Trump started to back out of Iranian Nuclear Deal, Iran threatened to name names of Western politicians that took bribes to get Nuclear deal approved in an attempt to get them to pressure Trump. Now oil deals have come to light that will be effected by the pull out. EU
1478 2018-06-11 20:37:57 Not OLIVE OIL, surely?
1479 2018-06-11 20:37:56 My mom asked me to take her car to get serviced, so I do—like the good daughter that I am. Her oil is at 1%! “Mom, when did the service light come on?” Her: “A month ago, why?” Y’all... I can’t. 
1480 2018-06-11 20:37:56 That is exactly what Trump wanted to happen so that he could push his coal agenda, his oil drilling agenda, and his oil pipeline building agenda. After all, climate change does not come from fossil fuel use, it just happens. Also keeps him from having to appoint any scientists.
1481 2018-06-11 20:37:52 Norway, Norway Norway - has a population of 5.233 million (2016) and has much Oil as the UK has to share amongst 70 Million - Fucking work the sums out you odious little worm you sprout more shit than a mushroom farm
1482 2018-06-11 20:37:51 As a Canadian pls let me clarify that if I were taking advantage of you you'd be stuffed full of strap-on right now, not chilling with plenty of crude oil, car parts and #BCweed.

1485 2018-06-11 20:37:46 @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump 
Dear Justin, Perhaps you could remind Donald that approximately 45% of their crude oil comes from Canada, and currently they pay us $23 CDN per barrel, and if Donald wants to threaten us with more tariffs, we should simply stop honouring old

1495 2018-06-11 20:36:16 Trudeau wants to retaliate against Trumps' tariffs? Put a massive tariff on Canadian oil exports to the US. Of course this will complicate the Canadian govt. nationalizing the XL pipeline. #Trudeau
1496 2018-06-11 20:36:11 Very sad actually.  Story talks about all tech (phones, etc) not just wind power.   You have to mine rare earth metals to get renewable energy. It is called renewable for a reason. Not like coal and oil. This is sad but you are kind of misleading people.

1500 2018-06-11 20:35:32 I don't think for 1 minute Trump really believes in America 1st.  It's the attitude that appeals to his base. His campaign knew he had to be a con man which came naturally,  and a snake oil salesman. Tell the people that wanted to hear it, what they wanted to hear.
1501 2018-06-11 20:35:29 What part of the iPhone still requires one to enter a passcode because the fingerprint reader is shit don’t you get?
1502 2018-06-11 20:35:27 Also i saw you use tea tree oil and coconut oil so just a couple of things: tea tree oil is very very drying for skin and should be used in small areas and usually as a solution with another oil. It’s best to use just for pimples bc it’s really strong and drying but still great
1503 2018-06-11 20:35:10 You would think by now that restaurants would have actual vegan options that aren’t pasta with oil, salad, fruit or sorbet. It’s 2018 get with the effing program. They are actually losing money!!
1504 2018-06-11 20:34:57 well, they predicted oil at 200, before it crashed in 2014
1505 2018-06-11 20:34:56 Fine……
Are you in Resistance or Enlightened?
1506 2018-06-11 20:34:29 You don't think so, huh?  How many people admire Robert De Niro?  How many people do you think admire him enough to consider his reasoning for what he did?

1512 2018-06-11 20:33:58 help us, Simon! Throw some oil on the fire! 
1513 2018-06-11 20:33:56 I think it may be because she didn’t form an articulate thought
1514 2018-06-11 20:33:46 everyone go ahead and pray for me because I just spend $96 on an oil change because the guy was cute
1515 2018-06-11 20:33:40 Financial Services don't deal in Assets? Really? Only debt! No effect on Sterling after NS Oil & Gas changes?
1516 2018-06-11 20:33:26 #ukog #Horsehill1 well flowed 1688 barrels of oil a day . The most successful Wildcat onshore vertical well test Ever in the UK. And shorts know it and are putting down UKOG just to close and then buy in lower. Fact! @grannysnuffer team all over LSE BB.
1517 2018-06-11 20:33:23 Loading the oil pipelines to America with Maple Syrup as we speak...
1518 2018-06-11 20:33:19 I am in need of someone that can safely and cost effectively remove 4 -500 and 1 - 1000 gallon oil tank from the basement under one of our garages.
1519 2018-06-11 20:33:18 Then scrap the farm bill end our subsidies to big oil. Lets start at home see how well that works out?
1520 2018-06-11 20:33:13 * In Europe, British Petroleum announced that it would end its investment partnership with the Iranian oil company in deep-sea drilling off the Scottish coast.
1521 2018-06-11 20:33:02 Toxic masculinity is Charlie complaining about glittery sun tan oil. #LoveIsland
1522 2018-06-11 20:32:36 No I'm not agreeing, I'm simply saying its driven by supply & demand Iran doesn't supply enough oil to us to make a difference, so the Iran deal really doesn't affect US markets but speculators ultimately drive the worldwide price on the spot market based on dozens of factors
1523 2018-06-11 20:32:28 Oil bons
1524 2018-06-11 20:32:22 These toxic, entitled, *small* people... Ugh. I have to wonder if publishers know that they are as obsolete as record companies, oil tycoons, and blacksmiths. It's only a matter of time.
1525 2018-06-11 20:32:12 15 Reasons I vote Democrat: Oil companies' 4% profit on 1 gl of gas is OBSCENE, but govt's 15% tax isn't.

1528 2018-06-11 20:31:35 Within 24 months Canada will be shipping oil on the world market instead of getting screwed by our southern neighbor.
1529 2018-06-11 20:31:35 My days!
A refinery near katsina ? Where's the oil coming from?
1530 2018-06-11 20:31:22 I had a nursing assistant who had an asthma attack when a patient was using a certain essential oil.
1531 2018-06-11 20:31:16 My skin cleared up like no-bodies business when I cut out dairy, and apparently I lived my life in slight discomfort and massive bloating because of it! Koko coconut milk is my go-to replacement. You can make pancakes with it instead of milk and olive oil instead of butter :)
1532 2018-06-11 20:31:03 Now that Kenya has started transporting the crude oil from Turkana to Mombasa, it's hoped that banks will stand firm in not dealing with those that might want to loot & launder the proceeds from the oil. Let all FIs practice AML due diligence #STOPTheseTHIEVES #TurkanaOil
1533 2018-06-11 20:30:39 I think I may have an oil I can mix it with. It may just be too dark too which doesn’t help. I’m gonna go to Ulta this week and see if I like any other shades they have
1534 2018-06-11 20:30:28 u should put tea tree oil + coconut oil on it!
1535 2018-06-11 20:30:19 @J_Lovering THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION KNOWS ABOUT ME AND NASSIM HARAMEIN IS PROTECTING OIL COMPANY DONATIONS AND THIS NUCLEAR ENERGY IS INSANE EVEN TO REVISIT HARAMEIN MAKING MY FUSION AND EVERYTHING I HAVE ON MY SITE AND MORE THATS WHY HES SITTING ON THIS
1536 2018-06-11 20:30:18 First time I’ve ever had to actually pay for an oil change and the man cut the price in half because I’m getting an education and pretty hahah. #mondayvibes #bethegood
1537 2018-06-11 20:30:13 What a display of ignorance by tRUMP. As a Canadian I hope Trudeau raises the price of the massive amounts of gas/oil and electricity that is sold to the U.S. by 3-4x Maybe then Americans will vote him out. Trump is a pig and a bully. My FLA vacations will continue #USTourism
1538 2018-06-11 20:29:53 can we stop with the fitspo’s pushing cbd oil??
did you guys not see the “unsubscribe” button at the top of jose emails or was that just me??
1539 2018-06-11 20:29:39 I agree...however. The worry is early iteration(s) i.e. B4 medically relevant correlations- which req. relevant "phenotype" that influences health outcomes and socio-economic that may be absent due to cost of wearables and snake oil ruining user trust and polluting data quality
1540 2018-06-11 20:29:36 Jamie Oliver has temporarily abandoned his healthy eating crusade to add olive oil to ice cream in his latest programme  #QuickAndEasyFood
1541 2018-06-11 20:29:29 Massage it with olive oil, add some lemon juice and pepper and avocado.
1542 2018-06-11 20:29:25 @NickHurdUK please help the mom who's son needs the CBD oil, he needs it.. STOP INTERFERING WITH MEDICAL treatments, it's enough CBD OIL is not a drug
1543 2018-06-11 20:29:12 Obama's giving advice to Democrats on how to win 2020!? LOL! 60% D voters left the Party and voted for Trump because of eight years of wars, oil drilling, mass surveillance and the worst unemployment and economy under Obama's leadership!
1544 2018-06-11 20:28:27 No one is debating your 8 year claim. We are calling you out as a liar for claiming it was the NRA, and refusing to acknowledge that it was Democrats in NJ who stifled the research.

Stop lying.
1545 2018-06-11 20:28:05 My car is officially dead. My mechanic says they cannot, in good faith, recommend any fix and let me drive it off the lot. 
Lita, my true love, is one oil leak away from an explosion. 

I am ruined.

1547 2018-06-11 20:27:49 While I remember, Woodcock has links to Bosphorous Global, who claim that he's asked questions in parliament for them.

They also have very similar oil links
1548 2018-06-11 20:27:45 So (esp for my face) I’ll use a moisturizer then an oil or serum on top
1549 2018-06-11 20:27:31 you get CBD oil in HOLLAND AND BARRET.
but your not allowed to give it to a child.
1550 2018-06-11 20:27:30 Mhmmm. That’s the culprit. Gotta get a real oil cleanser. I love a good cleansing balm. Gives the water cleanser a nice cushion to work off of.
1551 2018-06-11 20:27:16 So... normal oil market fluctuation?
1552 2018-06-11 20:27:15 It sucks getting an oil change for a newer car it's so damn expensive..  oh well
1553 2018-06-11 20:27:10 @jamieoliver will literally put olive oil on anything, plum tart-ta-tan with ice cream, why not sling some olive oil on that bitch too!
1554 2018-06-11 20:26:58 Jamie Oliver really can't help himself with extra virgin olive oil! Putting the bloody stuff on ice cream now . Weird man
1555 2018-06-11 20:26:55 Sadly, Arizona continues to back Republicans and in doing so enables big oil and climate change deniers!!!
1556 2018-06-11 20:26:53 The true reason Rome was great was because it spread Italian food, olive oil, and wine everywhere it went.
1557 2018-06-11 20:26:52 Nah just regular maintenance. They clean the car, do an oil change, rotate tires and a few other this for a decent price
1558 2018-06-11 20:26:39 jamaican black castor oil/peppermint/apple cider vinegar hair mask by shea moisture does wonders......and I don't even like shea moisture all that much for my hair
1559 2018-06-11 20:25:58 Reading the @One_Angry_Chef book and I am delighted to find it has a chapter about coconut oil…one of my most hated of "health" recommendations.
1560 2018-06-11 20:25:46 Wish Trump was leading Canada. The oil wouldnt be landlocked.
1561 2018-06-11 20:25:44 Who’s got the baby oil fools it’s time for finger rubs.
1562 2018-06-11 20:25:33 Do you eat oil? Going vegan helped my acne a lot actually, but when I cut out oil, THATS when my acne went away. :)

1566 2018-06-11 20:25:13 A lot of early aircraft had that like Avro504K or Sopwith Pup & Camel.  Had rotary engines where the whole engine span around with propeller attached, crankshaft on bulkhead.  Oh and castor oil total loss like a 2T.

1570 2018-06-11 20:24:13 Translation: "I waded through lots of articles Trump is wrong until I found one that confirms his delusion."

Also same type of thinking that drives alternative medicine sales. All snake oil.
1571 2018-06-11 20:24:05 i recommend black coffee, w/a drop of peppermint oil. the latter has many healthy advantages.
1572 2018-06-11 20:23:57 2 fry keilbasa in pot after slicing into pennies, remove keilbasa pennies and set aside for later (do not remove oil, will be used for a frond later)

3 fry andouille in same pot after slicing into pennies, remove andouille and set aside for later
1573 2018-06-11 20:23:49 the thing as i see it it;s quite simple... oil... wherever there is oil then troubles follows and why that happens? because the great "Free market economy" is addicted in to control every possible energy resource thus to create and expand oil monopoly in the world no matter what
1574 2018-06-11 20:23:40 I said I’d wash my car, get an oil change, take a test, & type up a book report but instead I’m gonna nap 
1575 2018-06-11 20:23:25 You're giving advice to Democrats on how to win 2020!? LOL! 70% D voters left the Party and voted for Trump because of YOU! 8 years of wars, oil drilling, mass surveillance and the worst unemployment and economy under your leadership! Trump Victory 2020!

1582 2018-06-11 20:23:04 You're giving advice to Democrats on how to win 2020!? LOL! 60% D voters left the Party and voted for Trump because of YOU! 8 years of wars, oil drilling, mass surveillance and the worst unemployment and economy under your leadership! Trump Victory 2020!

1586 2018-06-11 20:22:36 Tbh, I heard that it's better to order CBD oil from a reputable place because most of the time the stuff sold in stores isn't potent nor effective
1587 2018-06-11 20:22:21 Vote blue!!! Ca vote by Dems in the midterms were disoppointing...to say the least...so obviously more work needs to be done!! Dems you must vote BLUE if you want to keep waterways clean, oceans free of oil rigs, environment free of pollutants!!

1591 2018-06-11 20:21:32 Na wa!

Ever heard of IGR?

Does the fact that crude oil belongs to the UK & Dutch Govt, just like in Nigeria,  stopped then from being a federation? 

Granting autonomy is now centralisation? 
Are we just banding words or you truly understand their meanings and how they apply?
1592 2018-06-11 20:21:31 Off the oil 
1593 2018-06-11 20:21:28 what if celebrities did another "ice bucket challenge" except this time it is called "baby oil time"?? ..... these are just thoughts that needed to be put into the universe
1594 2018-06-11 20:21:04 I just had an oil vitamin capsule squirt all over my face. 
1595 2018-06-11 20:21:02 No, NJ squashed it with their 2003 legislation mandating that within 36 months of the first smart gun going on sale anywhere in the US, only smart guns can be sold inside NJ.

The NRA does not oppose smart guns.

The NRA opposes mandates requiring only smart guns be sold.

1600 2018-06-11 20:20:11 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

I didn't lease the apartment (because outside apt blding was numerous homeless & trash)

1633 2018-06-11 20:15:49 Not so much. Ancient Greece not that much meat or fish. Veggies fruits olive oil. Nothing like today. Roman army mostly vegan.
1634 2018-06-11 20:15:45 We.have our own currency,  Greece doesn't. Venezuela based it's economy on oil, the.price of which dived. It has also been subject to economic sabatage from oligarchs. Not problems for the UK.
1635 2018-06-11 20:15:41 isn't it funny cannabis oil can help people - they want it stopped. Alcohol kills thousands a year, in every shop. Madness.
1636 2018-06-11 20:15:30 It's a shitty meme as EU has absolute power to economically implode Russia by ending all oil/gas sales to EU which would plummet Russian GDP by 10 percent.

1638 2018-06-11 20:15:22 The @NRA squashed the first smart gun development 8 years before first iPhone, 3 years before the NJ law. 

You have to ask yourself as a citizen of the country that walked men on the moon, why isn't the NRA taking the lead on safer, smarter guns.

1647 2018-06-11 20:14:37 The Edmonton Oil Kings have the newest arena, Rogers Place, which opened in 2016. The Portland Winterhawks have the oldest arena, Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which opened in 1960.

The average age of a WHL arena is 27 years old.
1648 2018-06-11 20:14:34 @SoSueMe_ie hi what's the best oil free moisturizers to put on after fake tan? X
1649 2018-06-11 20:14:32 If only you showed this much compassion & interest in the young kids suffering from u dragging your feet & dancing to Big pharmas tunes, denying them CBD/HTC OIL !!  Shame on you, Harris!!

1651 2018-06-11 20:14:15 motor oil but she'd probably grease her joints with cooking oil because she's not .. wise, always,
1652 2018-06-11 20:14:06 I was at a debate in 2014 and someone said they looked out to sea and saw wealth and massive oil tankers etc, then looked into land and  saw poverty and food banks, and all she said about it was “there’s something not quite right here”
1653 2018-06-11 20:13:44 I've been using peppermint oil for years now! It is a true blessing for headaches :)
1654 2018-06-11 20:13:29 Jeremy is a grown up. Trump... BWAHAHAHA. Nope oil and water.
1655 2018-06-11 20:13:26 I wish I didn't have spot cream on my face, oil on my hair and love island on the tv because I want a milkshake
1656 2018-06-11 20:13:20 possibly apocryphal, but Descartes compared crying dogs (while he vivisected them) to squeaky gears that needed oil. not necessarily disagreeing, but curious what the distinction for you is, as a supporter of animal rights? surely it isn't carbon...
1657 2018-06-11 20:13:20 I predict that when Trump goes, Pruitt and Zinke go. They are Trump's, Big Oil, and chemical corporations' best foot soldiers. They are doing Trump's dirty work well, and the entire planet: people, animals, plants, oceans,climate will pay for this w/death, sickness, destruction.

1661 2018-06-11 20:12:38 Αν την τριχια την περασουμε με baby oil γλιστράει καλυτερα απο το ναυλον σκοινι;
Ξερει καποιος να πει;
Γιατι περαν των αλλων πρεπει να είμαστε άνθρωποι.
1662 2018-06-11 20:12:31 Of course my Stress Away essential oil is at home.
1663 2018-06-11 20:12:24 The tech companies (google, MS, FB, Apple) have more money then anyone else and they are (obstinately) left leaning. Why aren't they competing for money on the dems side? Isn't that the whole pt of citizens united? Fight back! Who is it we need to bankrupt? Crusty old oil barons?
1664 2018-06-11 20:12:06 benefit over what? if it is oil, then its turkana's, pokots have no share in it.
1665 2018-06-11 20:12:02 Turning up the radio always fixes those weird ticks my engine makes. It works so well I only need to do an oil change once a year.
1666 2018-06-11 20:11:57 The First Aid Beauty Cream and a face oil is what i use on my clients with exczema before makeup and they always look FLAWLESS!
1667 2018-06-11 20:11:47 Haha.. 

I like that "Chi girl's" comments about the market.  A lot of fun !!!

She seems to know what she is doing.  Especially for Crude Oil ( $CL ).
1668 2018-06-11 20:11:44 Actually there's nothing coming out of the tailpipe, just it's been overheating and i suspect oil in the radiator. The steam is because i don't have the cap for the expansion rank so it boils off if the temperature rises above normal
1669 2018-06-11 20:11:38 It’s a catchy title for her next exhibition.
1670 2018-06-11 20:11:32 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.” Ps. 23:5
1671 2018-06-11 20:11:11 Great points. And governments consider transparency + security spending like oil and water, so we may never know from them.
1672 2018-06-11 20:11:09 CT magic cream + rosehip oil! Whew she THEEQ
1673 2018-06-11 20:10:44 @BMWUSA 1st issue was funny; had no fluids & oil to run in svc ‘18 M5, 15 days down. Now the car shuts off and speed and I find out there’s now a recall? Thxs4 the head’s up! At what point is this thing NOT in for service?? #nownotfunny
1674 2018-06-11 20:10:44 Me, putting essential oil on my nipples: “This is the only scent I want on my body.”
1675 2018-06-11 20:10:30 im trying literally everything to get this baby out, lord please bring on the contractions! next im trying castor oil
1676 2018-06-11 20:10:24 If that’s so, then why did Trump bomb Russia’s closest ally Bashar al Assad,
open gas and oil productions that hurt them economically, and kill 200 Russians in Syria? 
Think. Don’t be sheep.

1678 2018-06-11 20:10:17 Sorry sounds too much like the old Iraq oil for food scheme which was riddled with corruption and starved countless Iraqis. If we really want more for more got to put all sanctions on the table.
1679 2018-06-11 20:10:11 It’s new technology, although well tested. If we must use petroleum based fuel I’d rather it’s made from plastic waste than ever more oil from shale or ‘new’ oilfields.

We could recycle the plastic we get out of the ocean.

1681 2018-06-11 20:10:07 When I had extensions they ended up ripping out all my eyelashes so I stopped wearing eye makeup all together for awhile and put coconut oil on them and now they’re naturally sooooo long.
1682 2018-06-11 20:10:04 Coconut oil for everything. Putting this shit on my hair, on my skin, on my lips. Elixir. Youth serum.

1684 2018-06-11 20:09:53 Good point from @ravmishr #BRKINI2012 - You don’t wait to change the oil in your car until it breaks down (hopefully), so why wait to upgrade firmware until a critical issue happens? Upgrade once a year at least. #CLUS
1685 2018-06-11 20:09:46 Depends how the word is used, if you're talking about taking a microbial ecology approach to studying the bacterial communities associated with the human body, there is value to this and some good work. Alas, also a term used to flog snake oil. (And also some bad work).
1686 2018-06-11 20:09:36 You definitely need some on hand for specific spills like syrup, oil, grease. They do a number on the washing machine

1693 2018-06-11 20:08:56 i use @Nolask_sentials hyperpigmentaion serum & iconic elixir for my acne scars! they’ve lightened up a ton & ive had acne for 10+ years. for oil control- i also use their moisturizer & mattifying spray. you can use NEILA15 at checkout & save some $$ too. i hope this helps!
1694 2018-06-11 20:08:44 So I went and took my company vehicle to get an oil change and they tell me I have a major antifreeze leak, I go out there and my ac was sweating

1696 2018-06-11 20:08:35 Got an oil change appointment that's not for another hour at a auto place that is notorious for taking forever (no names but it's a place featuring "boys who are peppy") so expect alot if tweeting.
1697 2018-06-11 20:08:30 made white beans with lemon and olive oil for my tall strong wife and she loved it. thank you @chelseaperetti
1698 2018-06-11 20:08:14 Sadly I cannot ear at Chick Filet because they cook in peanut oil. But if I could....
1699 2018-06-11 20:08:00 We are too busy keeping the Saudis happy Gaynor if the oil wells went dry over night you’d see them dancing to a different tune
1700 2018-06-11 20:07:47 Population given new diet guidelines will
- take up what recommended things they can afford (oil, some fruit & vege)
- give up what they think they can do without (red meat,)
- still be powerless against addictions (sugar, alcohol)
& guidelines will take effect in that context
1701 2018-06-11 20:07:43 But it happened when Trump reneged on the Iran Deal. You are now,  finally agreeing with me. It's not Iran's oil, it started when Trump dumped the deal.
1702 2018-06-11 20:07:33 Another oil services name that looks decent is $BP on daily and weekly. Monthly starting to look like it wants to push towards 200 SMA or higher over that. Keep an eye.
1703 2018-06-11 20:07:30 Cosh we r rn discovering new energy, and will soon be world’s #1 oil provider (soon in relation to history— May take a yr or 2). I believe when he leaves US will have no debt. Look at our stock market & image economy if all POTUS reforms approved & off Fed Reserve banking system

1705 2018-06-11 20:07:16 I use vitamin e oil or rose hip oil, but I have super dry skin so I prefer oils. I’ve tried the aveno moisturizer and it’s really good too!
1706 2018-06-11 20:07:14 Last week I found a cheap source of chili & garlic infused olive oil, and the only way I see this ending is with an intervention.
1707 2018-06-11 20:07:12 Bout to cover myself in baby oil and listen to young hot ebony all day

1718 2018-06-11 20:06:20 You didn't see "as well " in my reply ??

1720 2018-06-11 20:06:12 I love how Finn's baby oil videos is making everyone question their sexual orientation... I mean who wouldn't tho?
1721 2018-06-11 20:05:59 NO SORRY CANADA  IS  A COMPLETELY  SELF SUFFICIENT COUNTRY  WE DON'T NEED ANYONE BUT U WANT  WHAT WE HAVE N ALL THOSE OIL PIPELINES SHOULD BE TURNING  OFF ABOUT NOW
1722 2018-06-11 20:05:55 It is the oil speculators, you & I both know Trump nor the Iran deal have anything to do with folks betting the market but those betting on long term high oil costs will get burned, after Trump cancelled the deal, the Saudis agreed to increase production to bring the price down.
1723 2018-06-11 20:05:49 Give them some credit. At least the sign "keep it in the ground" is honest. They want oil to stay in the ground. It wasn't about the pipeline.
1724 2018-06-11 20:05:41 In a dangerous way ma. There is palm oil instead
1725 2018-06-11 20:05:31 What is better, CBD oil or MM?  Living with severe pain.   Thank you Mr. Morgan.

1727 2018-06-11 20:05:21 Coal and oil are also non renewable sources. We will run out. Coal is a heavy pollutant. Nuclear is not so safe as the world has seen.
1728 2018-06-11 20:05:07 We need to position ourselves so we keep on being filled, so we are in the right place to continue receiving the blessings of God.Fresh oil illuminates God’s strategies and enables us to have victory over our enemies. #giantslayers
1729 2018-06-11 20:05:06 US demand simply stellar in 2018 ytd. not sustainable at these levels though.. but suply has even more troubles so the bull oil is not over yet, just retracing down before OPEC #oott
1730 2018-06-11 20:04:52 It shouldn’t take this long for an oil change bruh 
1731 2018-06-11 20:04:39 He has clearly stated he wants to phase out the oil patch and he could have saved taxpayers 4.5bil and increased gdp/jobs by enforcing the pipeline approval rather than buying the pipeline that taxpayers now need to pay to build.
1732 2018-06-11 20:04:36 As long as you got a ton of oil and a hot pan, should work. Black bean sauce is one of the best condiments around
1733 2018-06-11 20:04:16 If you look at it another way, it looks like an oil painting. 
1734 2018-06-11 20:04:13 Preach on Spec. My buddy’s mom worked at a trophy shop in the 80s. Grey and Stanley cups came in more than a few times to bang out some dents... as it should be !!
1735 2018-06-11 20:04:08 Was going to hard at my job. Didn't pay attention to super heated oil....

1738 2018-06-11 20:04:00 In 2014-15 when crude oil prices reduced from $100 to $50 per barrel, the centre earned Rs.800bn from fuel tax while State govt. earned Rs. 1600bn. At that time Central govt. imposed 40% of fuel excise duties as cess which now had become 65% due to elevated prices of crude oil

1747 2018-06-11 20:02:45 He doesn’t realise that the petrodollar was agreed on after ww2 and the agreement was for 60 years which ended 12 years ago. If he pisses every country off then they can if they wish stop using the dollar for oil trade, which would bring the US (and global) economy down.
1748 2018-06-11 20:02:42 I do not give a shit what your favorite snake hip oil saleswombman is telling you
1749 2018-06-11 20:02:37 We get more due to Geographical differences
Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years,thats 300BILLION+ 
Scotland is a rich country,who subsidised teh rUK for 50 years and still does today.
Scots dont need "Extra" we need independence to run our own affairs.
1750 2018-06-11 20:02:33 He wont like engines or oil 
1751 2018-06-11 20:02:08 Then Senator Collins do something. Or maybe Canada needs to turn off the pumps, no more water, electricity, oil, natural gas. Maybe Canada starts to do business with China and to hell with the United States. You and the Rep's know Trump is a fool and yet you do nothing
1752 2018-06-11 20:02:01 Going to green technology will produce a lot more wealth for Canada, plus more jobs across the country, as the price goes down to build the green technology! Oil on the other hand, just keeps going up!

1757 2018-06-11 20:01:36 Why has been excise duty on diesel & petrol increased 400% and 200% respectively in Modi rule (2014-2018). ?????
Why Modi is not pushing for electric car's... is it because he getting funds from reliance oil refineries. ???

1769 2018-06-11 20:00:07 I know but prices skyrocketed as soon as Trump reneged on Iran Deal. It's not Canada profiting it's the oil companies. I didn't say Iran raised the prices, our gas companies did. More profits for the extremely rich because of trump.

1778 2018-06-11 19:59:25 She did not reply me, only for her to start hitting her head on the wall, she was saying something I could not hear, I moved close to her, grabbed anointing oil and water at the same time and poured it on her head, she was still talking.
1779 2018-06-11 19:59:22 These leaders are very right.Unless the government wants to witness frequent hijacking of trucks ferrying oil to the coast.
Pipeline should be built to transport the crude oil from the mining site to the refinery,This will help minimise environmental degradation & fatal accident
1780 2018-06-11 19:59:13 Crude oil prices climbed as Iraq's oil minister warned producers against easing limits on production curbs offsetting reports of an uptick in Russian and Saudi output

1781 2018-06-11 19:59:04 A smooth mashed potatoes with black truffles or real truffle oil would be a welcome right about now.
1782 2018-06-11 19:58:56 They cook their chicken in a delicious combo of peanut oil and intolerance.
1783 2018-06-11 19:58:53 worker just came out and stopped the bus at convention place station and told the driver "don't drive through the oil spill!"

okay
1784 2018-06-11 19:58:46 That's got to be up there in number ONES most idiotic things I've ever heard!! Stupid liberials just can't enjoy good food snake oil for you from now on Mr big shot CEO. #NORESPECT
1785 2018-06-11 19:58:19 Do you enjoy high gas prices?
Because if Canada slaps a tariff on their oil exports, we won’t be able to afford to drive!
Majority of our oil consumption comes from the Canucks, ya might wanna pick up a book or too!
1786 2018-06-11 19:58:17 So shall we impose supply management in gasoline, to guarantee a rate of return for oil companies? Or for everything else in the economy?
1787 2018-06-11 19:58:07 @neededselfcare 

-Get it trimmed every 6-8 weeks
-Oil your hair at leat twice a week

1788 2018-06-11 19:57:57 what's the difference here?  I've only ever used coconut oil for my hair
1789 2018-06-11 19:57:56 Cool.. that's also a progressive way of implementing change nd my point about you not being a victim wasn't to ridicule you but to point out that takes living the experience to understand.
1790 2018-06-11 19:57:47 Did I ask this bitch to put all this baby oil on my damn legs ?
1791 2018-06-11 19:57:44 That HTC oil had me too fried
1792 2018-06-11 19:57:37 the latest oil 60x60" , the Devas came in slowly and gently, needing their time to find a place in the painting that is right.
1793 2018-06-11 19:57:37 Using the tragic suicide of Anthony Bourdain to further your pro-military stance disgusts me.
One made the effort to reach out and connect to people of color, the other takes people of color and trades them bullets and blood for oil.

1795 2018-06-11 19:57:19 Same for me today after having to get my brakes done and an oil change. Ugh.
1796 2018-06-11 19:57:16 今日のガシャ更新でロコか…
1797 2018-06-11 19:57:14 I feel like the most difficult part of living with @MattCocco is deciding what olive oil to buy #carbonellalltheway
1798 2018-06-11 19:56:52 I made a keto smoothie this morning with coffee, pea protein, ghee/coconut oil, almond butter and flax meal. #yum #keto #ImTryingIt
1799 2018-06-11 19:56:43 @etvImbewu it seems like everyone remember those words Bangizwe told them before ngoZakithi.... Maluju oil is going to the Mess now... Nice episode @Tshatha_Ngobe #ImbewuTheSeed
1800 2018-06-11 19:56:29 何やってるんだよ団長！(熱い手のひら返し)
1801 2018-06-11 19:56:15 What did you service fam? My oil change is usually $72
1802 2018-06-11 19:56:08 Try mixing 1/3 castor oil with 1/3 grape seed oil and 1/3 jojoba skin will be on pow pow
1803 2018-06-11 19:55:39 is there an essential oil to make me better looking?
1804 2018-06-11 19:55:37 Iceland doing it right removing black plastic and palm oil from own brand products 
1805 2018-06-11 19:55:35 Favorite pastime: watching coconut oil melt and solidify.
1806 2018-06-11 19:55:35 大人になってからの方が家庭環境が悪いことのデメリットを自覚する、子供の時は地獄で耐えて大人になってからは呪いを振り払うのに何年もかかるし、パートーナーに紹介したくないし呪いを一緒に背負ってもらうのはばかられるし、親と同じ様な事を子供にしないか恐ろしい、多分原因が亡くなるまで続く

1809 2018-06-11 19:54:51 Indeed -  but we need to agree on the oil wealth division first
1810 2018-06-11 19:54:39 They tell you it smells bad, and goes right on eating their sandwich with a gallon of OIL and VINEGAR on it.

I'll give up my ginger slices and vinegar with soup dumplings after they pry the chopsticks out of my cold, dead hands.
1811 2018-06-11 19:54:39 oil investors are much more interested in battle over supply. events in places  like Ukraine and Syria provide a much more aggressive risk.
1812 2018-06-11 19:54:34 UK a bit strange b/c of north sea oil dynamics + services dynamics + Brexit

IMF study was massive, looked a broad set of countries, was published in the WEO for a reason.  should be given a bit of weight in my view.
1813 2018-06-11 19:54:29 I need to go get an oil change & a car wash before the end of the afternoon or I’m not goin to end up doing it at all
1814 2018-06-11 19:54:18 Those look really old.
Did you even read the link above?
Even without the Oil, which has generated ~£300bn extra for UK coffers that the Tories & Labour have pissed away, Scotland contributes more per capita than any other part of the Union, embarrassingly more.
1815 2018-06-11 19:54:00 $27 el dólar, no quiero escuchar ningún chacarero llorar por el gas oil, o el glisfofato..
1816 2018-06-11 19:53:57 What’s wrong with the Cherokee?? She needs an oil change  lol
1817 2018-06-11 19:53:51 ตัดแต่งได้สวยงามมากคับ
1818 2018-06-11 19:53:49 Skinless and boneless sardines in extra virgin olive oil. A great snack!
1819 2018-06-11 19:53:33 This hemp oil makes my skin glow 
1820 2018-06-11 19:53:20 This gelato oil I’m smoking is so gosh darn tasty. I love it! 
1821 2018-06-11 19:53:19 Fin  first the baby oil now the peanut butter
1822 2018-06-11 19:53:17 She chose the wrong parents.
1823 2018-06-11 19:53:09 I’m not worried.. this trade war is much bigger than ford.. as for oil , you can always get into bed with Venezuela.. your potus has a “ thing” for dictators..have fun being the laughing stalk of the planet 
1824 2018-06-11 19:53:01 WE COOK WITH OLIVE OIL DAMN IT MY LORD
1825 2018-06-11 19:52:58 He needs to tone up a bit more before using all that oil
1826 2018-06-11 19:52:53 apologies in advance -- I am back tonight.  busy week in local sports with Black Bears media day, the Hillbilly Hardball tournament and Lucas Oil Motocross racing, but tonight, we take a closer look at one former @GSCpioneers football standout nominated for the CFB HOF...
1827 2018-06-11 19:52:37 And how do u know small club get outta here just go n spend ur oil money ur a baby club shhhh
1828 2018-06-11 19:52:26 One of my favorite hobbies is throwing off mechanics when I get an oil change
1829 2018-06-11 19:52:04 Excellent, now you come to the point. The question is why don't we have the infra, market  regulations etc? Because we refuse to implement the needed reforms that will boost investor confidence. Our oil/gas asset are still shrouded in secrecy at the mercy of few, yet in democracy
1830 2018-06-11 19:52:01 We have arrived.  We played the OPEC games for decades.  Last one with the oil reserves wins . . . I hope the Arabs can find an export use for SAND!  
1831 2018-06-11 19:51:56 ugh complete opposite here if i dont use coconut oil my scalp starts literally bleeding lmao wanna switch?
1832 2018-06-11 19:51:47 With good yes, though we send you ALL of our oil, at a deep discount (~$35/bl), which is what the Republicans use as an argument that there's actually a deficit. With oil down that deficit becomes another surplus but who's counting.
1833 2018-06-11 19:51:42 My classes cost $5 and back rub with baby oil
1834 2018-06-11 19:51:38 @business just outlined what #NorthKoreaSummit is about
rare earth metals oil and the resources NK needs to extract them
Let's see how this plays out
1835 2018-06-11 19:51:31 I hate that. I go in for a bar of palm oil free, plastic wrapping free chocolate, and they ask if I need a bag. Why would I need a bag? I can literally get the whole thing in my mouth, if that was my thing! #plasticfree
1836 2018-06-11 19:51:28 Hitting the salad bar? Avoid fruit salads, as they usually contain syrups or sugars. You also want to avoid bacon bits, cheese, croutons and most salads dressings. Use a small amount of oil and vinegar dressing.
1837 2018-06-11 19:51:24 Coconut oil is genuinely a blessing sent from the heavens above 
1838 2018-06-11 19:51:06 Lol 1tbsp turmeric, 1tbsp honey 1tbsp brown sugar.. mix together, add a little bit of coconut oil and water
1839 2018-06-11 19:50:46 Mineral Oil "Synthol" he I'll pop soon  soon
Good Luck frying yourself 
1840 2018-06-11 19:50:44 Olive oil and a touch of Zaatar.
1841 2018-06-11 19:50:43 Wonder if Heathrow Airport customs officers went to the pub afterwards to celebrate confiscating a small bottle of Cannabis Oil ?
1842 2018-06-11 19:50:32 wait till you discover butter. its like oil. from milk. a big brick of it
1843 2018-06-11 19:50:19 I rush to drink Goya Oil whenever I eat in dream.
1844 2018-06-11 19:50:15 Well his a big man he needs a lot of baby oil. he probably borrow some from finn.
1845 2018-06-11 19:50:14 AND these are reasons that people running for school boards local/state are SO important - as well as local state/local gov't reps! Gov In-Justice here in WV is a corp shill and refused to raise taxes just 2% on gas/oil/coal so we could pay our teachers-this shit HAS TO STOP 2
1846 2018-06-11 19:50:14 Saturated fat is bad & unsaturated fat is down right evil for body.
About only good saturated fat is coconut oil, but don't cook it above 250 F.
1847 2018-06-11 19:50:09 I always keep that mf thang (Argan oil w/ 10 drops tea tree, 1:1 ACV + water mix) on me
1848 2018-06-11 19:50:09 Really disappointed in @Lexus .. you knew there was an oil issue with the 2010 rx models and waited til 11 to change it.. and offered nothing to 2010 owners #badtaste #standbehindyourproduct
1849 2018-06-11 19:50:04 Taking my first Lyft ride. Complimentary of @clawsonhonda while my car gets it's oil changed.

1852 2018-06-11 19:49:45 Massage my scalp with castor oil and tell me you love me
1853 2018-06-11 19:49:45 More and more people are learning about the benefits of using coconut oil and coconut is the perfect fruit for #Virgo.
1854 2018-06-11 19:49:38 I feel like using olive oil to tan is the most Italian thing I’ve ever done
1855 2018-06-11 19:49:37 Morocco basically needs to be more powerful than Algeria's gas/oil advantage in Northern Africa and EU. Buhari's vuvuzelas deserve flogging.
1856 2018-06-11 19:49:34 When I'm getting my oil changed and the guy shows me the dipstick... I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking at or what I'm supposed to say. I just say "right on" every time.
1857 2018-06-11 19:49:28 @EvanDyerCBC hard to say it where it would kill us in AB but the best retaliation would be oil . That’s one thing they get that they would not like to have the price go up on
1858 2018-06-11 19:49:28 Man i swear i was finessing the free oil changes 
1859 2018-06-11 19:49:22 What can I say! Keep fighting/ searching for a trial? Everyone up this way is telling me canabis oil is the option, but Cancer Care and McMillan say there's nothing in it? #fuckcancer
1860 2018-06-11 19:49:22 Billions in subsidies to US dairy farmers. This is why the tariff US does the same thing on other products. How about Canada charges US world price for oil? No more deals!!
1861 2018-06-11 19:49:13 I don’t get what Tunisia and Malta have to do with it - in talking about Libya’s oil wealth
1862 2018-06-11 19:49:10 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
1863 2018-06-11 19:49:06 The SNP are not purely a single issue party, nor is it all about the Oil.
If you hadn't noticed, renewables are one of the top aims.
Scotland has the largest offshore wind and tidal generation potential in Europe.
An iScotland could wind down Oil & Gas, the UK cannot afford to.
1864 2018-06-11 19:48:41 We turn over and make more profit than the scousers surely? So why are they splashing it like they are owned by a middle eastern oil rich country and we are skimping as if Wenger’s ghost remains!
1865 2018-06-11 19:48:40 So employees at maluju oil want free bonuses. How nice #ImbewuTheSeed
1866 2018-06-11 19:48:33 CBD in their food is good for them, it doesn’t have the same effects as getting them high off of your own weed. The risk of death is low but it can be higher depending on the size of the dog. Regardless smoking them out is toxic, but CBD oil and such products are super beneficial
1867 2018-06-11 19:48:16 Have you tried this routine?
1. Zero oil cleanser from Origins
2. Air dry
3. Follow with any noncomedogenic Moisturizer
4. When that’s soaked in follow with a spray toner. And then again at night+ Wash your sheets often and pillowcases cause they can retain stuff that clogs pores
1868 2018-06-11 19:48:14 LOL it’s like you’ve seen my coochie before  some oils and conditioners have ingredients that can upset your PH if it gets inside. I know the benefits of using oil and conditioner but it can also be bad if they get inside the vagina. But it works for you so go off girly.
1869 2018-06-11 19:48:13 Is Magnolia oil good? My skin is soooo dry
1870 2018-06-11 19:48:13 The summit is a farce, orchestrated by Putin to try and give tRUmp some credibility. North Korea keeps getting Russian oil, coal plenty of propaganda in exchange for pretending to stop making WMD's
1871 2018-06-11 19:48:12 I would take this one if I could. I remember so well my early collector days - cleaning hundreds of rusted roman bronze coins. At night in the kitchen. Olive oil, brass brush, and occasional electrolysis, the last being particularly destructive.

1873 2018-06-11 19:48:08 I'll try butter when I get home. I tried oil. Internet said dish soap and string lmao. I'm taking my black ass to the hospital!!
1874 2018-06-11 19:48:07 Oil, coal and natural gas are not 'fossil fuels', they were not created by biological matter. They are created deep within our still very active Earth through abiotic process. The Russians proved this.
1875 2018-06-11 19:48:01 I have a friend wanting to stop her medication and just do the oil, what would u recommend
1876 2018-06-11 19:48:01 I just got a free oil change 
1877 2018-06-11 19:47:58 Hmmm, I think you're confusing using cannabis medicinally by individuals with medicinal cannabis prescribed and overseen by a doctor. Consistency is everything in terms of dose and potency for the latter - especially with oil, b/c of high concentrations involved
1878 2018-06-11 19:47:43 Smoke this backwood and change my oil real quick
1879 2018-06-11 19:47:38 Putting beard oil is one of the most satisfying things I do throughout my day
1880 2018-06-11 19:47:32 So since they got someone new working at my dealership, he saw that i got my car used and he stopped my free oil changes  that’s sooo trash omg
1881 2018-06-11 19:47:26 For anyone keeping score:
Increased military spending 
less free trade 
pissed off allies 
reduced environmental protections  investment in coal/oil 
obstruction of Justice 
Blatent racism 
Cut climate research 
Sexual assault 
Muslim ban 
1882 2018-06-11 19:47:25 Some are. And some at 10x larger in the west (fruits orchards in BC and oil in AB and cash cropping in SK) Dairy is one of the few that is reasonably spread out.

1884 2018-06-11 19:47:05 So pretty
1885 2018-06-11 19:46:52 i really like the taste of kaccha tel, any kind of edible oil, even more than ghee
1886 2018-06-11 19:46:45 That man could sell me snake oil and I’d still buy it
1887 2018-06-11 19:46:45 moving to TEXAS,definitely,The Permian Basin Still Has an Awful Lot of Oil,Permian Basin SHALE-OIL boom,BIG MONEY,new gold,2018................tbc?
1888 2018-06-11 19:46:32 I'm using tea tree oil. 100%. Way too scared of peroxide products.
1889 2018-06-11 19:46:31 Equatorial Guinea is know as the Kuwait of Africa because of oil?
1890 2018-06-11 19:46:20 I c vkook
1891 2018-06-11 19:45:59 Well it's all dependent on your dogs weight age and activity level. I feed our dogs a drumstick, 2 chicken hearts, a chicken gizzard, some beef cubes, and a chicken foot and a fish oil capsule. I use the sojos base mix to balance it out but you can just put a spoonful of spinach.
1892 2018-06-11 19:45:59 component parts are:

1) grind floor bare; this method is best IMO because it does a few steps in one (paint removal, oil removal, dirt removal)
2) etch concrete (acid or whatever is included in kit)
3) rinse, brush, repeat a million times
4) epoxy paint perfect clean floor
1893 2018-06-11 19:45:51 @tread_quarters So I took my car into my favorite Tread Quarters today for its regular oil change & tire rotation service.  To my disappointment, tire rotation is no longer included with the oil change. What gives TQ? I may as well go back to the dealer.
1894 2018-06-11 19:45:50 Yup. Gotta drop the kids off before work.
1895 2018-06-11 19:45:44 [8:43PM] @Trans_Oceana: Driving from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION to JAKANDE LEKKI is a slow and steady movement  #TELTrafficReport #TrafficChief
1896 2018-06-11 19:45:33 Don't we have more people? Explain how we protect Germany? We start war's around the world for oil and your shrinking petro dollar's which is more of problem, imo.
1897 2018-06-11 19:45:25 Since I've started reading @maxlugavere's #GeniusFoods I've been checking ingredient lists and almost everything has either gluten or corn/canola/sunflower oil. Goodbye, fluffernutters and cereal!
1898 2018-06-11 19:45:23 僕も過去に、親のDVは気のせいじゃないか？と１度言われた事あった、煙草もお酒も飲まない人だったから叩かれたりは中学の時までで終わったから怪我の跡なんて無い、だから他人には証明できない
でもあの地獄の様な年数は大人になっても変わらない、どれだけ強くなろうが一生付きまとってくる
1899 2018-06-11 19:45:22 That POS 1st negotiation was SUPPOSED to be w/ big pharma gouging Americans FIRST 
He threw his arms in the air saying its complicated. Some artist of deals. Bankrupt bizman with a gallon of snake oil 
He doesn't GAF about u or any1 but himself
1900 2018-06-11 19:45:17 It seems like #ImbewuTheSeed is more about the business of (Maluju Oil) than the actual concept about the seed which is more about the ancient family secret.
1901 2018-06-11 19:45:08 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
1902 2018-06-11 19:45:04 what is UP i am HOME with coco oil in my hair, drinking cider on a monday afternoon, cleaning, organizing, AND I SUCCESSFULLY PRESERVED MY WEDDING BOUQUET 
1903 2018-06-11 19:45:02 No not really, none that I’ve tried have really worked for me. & lmao I always thought about using coconut oil but then I was like hell nah ima cook out there 
1904 2018-06-11 19:45:02 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1905 2018-06-11 19:44:44 Green onions, sesame oil and a few drops of worcestershire sauce
1906 2018-06-11 19:44:44 I always laugh when people say stuff like that to @Oil_Guns_Merica. XD
1907 2018-06-11 19:44:39 I just got my oil changed all by myself y’all I’m an adult
1908 2018-06-11 19:44:34 The Scottish government *is not* in charge of the North Sea Oil & Gas industry, it is a wholly reserved matter to the UK government.
Do you think an iScotland might choose to focus more on renewables, or would it continue to extract the 90% extra Oil&Gas the UK needs?
1909 2018-06-11 19:44:28 Also treated myself to some cuticle oil, nail envy and vitamins. And I’ve honestly never been so happy  #mumlife

1912 2018-06-11 19:43:35 Guy argue with knowledge. 
1. We all no NG rely on oil for almost everything. Pls check the value of oil when dollar was 190 and when it changed.
2. If NG attempt to increase salary without proper setting the economy will crash. Do u think US still buy oil like before ask Dubai.
1913 2018-06-11 19:43:21 If you can, move to Canada, they're not as bloody stupid as this backward country. Cannabis oil saves lives, it can be good for you, it's natural, it's not a mixture of poisons produced by rich pharmaceutical companies who care about profit first, safety second.

1915 2018-06-11 19:43:06 By the end of the day, Dennis Rodman will be rowing a boat full of nukes to his newly purchased oil rig. So the nation of Rodmania is born, may their leader live long.
1916 2018-06-11 19:43:01 Because the bill contained a slew of poison pill amendments that made signing it impossible. If they would have passed a clean bill without amendments, it would have been signed.

1924 2018-06-11 19:42:01 A bottle of rapeseed oil in the UK usually cost 2 or 3 times one of vegetable oil; however if you check the ingredients of the latter it is almost always rapeseed oil.
1925 2018-06-11 19:41:55 How else could be sure if there was any oil left in it?
1926 2018-06-11 19:41:53 Crude oil...detergent. Some one tell ----> #ocrbiology <----- that its a BIOLOGY exam.
1927 2018-06-11 19:41:50 Can you tell me if the oil helps with depression and anxiety?
1928 2018-06-11 19:41:47 No - New Jersey squashed smart gun development in 2003 with their poison pill legislation.

1930 2018-06-11 19:41:23 Note: The US hit paydirt, literally, in Alaska long before oil was discovered when gold was discovered in the sparking a new gold rush. Oil may never have been discovered without the previous boom in wealth and population.
1931 2018-06-11 19:41:14 I recommend that you give your sister a hemp oil, it can heal cancer.
1932 2018-06-11 19:40:59 I found my oil pen in my car, which is both good and bad. Good because I found it, bad because I need to re-evaluate how often I clean out my car

1934 2018-06-11 19:40:28 there’s more backstory than that, but I shortened it for the sake of not wanting to type it all out. she made it like she wanted a relationship from him, and he really thought she was serious. she was actually married and her husband was working on an oil field. she used a 15
1935 2018-06-11 19:40:25 So many fucking squalling kids about to get on this flight home. Where my usual oil workers? I am uber bitchy, too. Must. Sleep. More.
1936 2018-06-11 19:40:21 He did it for the oil companies. Now the price of oil has nowhere to go but up. It’s also benefits Russia because they settle on a large supply of oil. Only their money will go for arms and ammunition.
1937 2018-06-11 19:40:18 Cbd oil, ask your vet - has helped so many older pups
1938 2018-06-11 19:40:18 @generalelectric Just received a note on tweeter about buying a washer at lowes and in a short period of time the transmission started leading oil and is having a hard time getting satisfaction. I am having the same experience, transmission leaking oil and ruining our clothes.

1945 2018-06-11 19:39:13 Canada pipeline across US was all for Canadian oil, not America. Take a hint: Conoco removed 17 bn $ from Canada last year.
1946 2018-06-11 19:39:09  shoddy journalism.. see #PIC statement, Afric Oil and Zonkizizwe statements.. none of whom your Journo bothered to contact

1948 2018-06-11 19:38:54 Your son that hold Phd with vast English what does he brought to your region for his 6years than oil spill,  kidnapping, bunkering, cultism and division to the entire country under the guise of political pursuits....
1949 2018-06-11 19:38:48 Pixi by Petra facial kit (exfoliant, toner, moisturizer), lush herbalism cleanser, lush mask of magnaminty, zskin spot treatment (got it in an ipsy bag, now trying to find it retail) and tea tree + jojoba oil is a great spot treatment as well
1950 2018-06-11 19:38:41 Today would be a good day to have an Energy Secretary who wasn't surprised that the job is managing the nuclear arsenal not touring oil rigs.
1951 2018-06-11 19:38:40 If the token actually serves a utility, there's room for both. Just like you can buy oil/gas ETFs for investment purposes or you can buy gas for your car from a regular 'ol gas station.
1952 2018-06-11 19:38:39 Actually, just about every aspect of policy Trump has pursued has caused problems for Putin.  Two examples: Increasing fracking drives down oil prices that are a major part of Russian income. And he's armed the Ukranians.

1955 2018-06-11 19:38:24 Seven Seas Cod Liver Oil! I remember mocking a classmate's boyfriend at college in the '90s with hilarious references to that because he was ... 33... and therefore "really old"

#90sTM
1956 2018-06-11 19:37:54 Just to be annoying for a little while longer....exfoliating is wonderful advice, I love it. But baby oil and conditioner, not so much. Also, you can definitely be informative without demeaning other women. But thank you! You as well!
1957 2018-06-11 19:37:43 Coconut oil when she rubbing on me

1960 2018-06-11 19:37:07 The people I knew raving about them had medical grade or knew someone who knew had cbd oil edibles.
1961 2018-06-11 19:37:01  Some little critters ate all my tomatoes!   My zucchini and eggplants and cucumbers are fine... but my poor tomatoes! I’ll spray the ground with peppermint oil and see if that works.  It’s on...
1962 2018-06-11 19:37:01 Environmental racism also applies to all of ag. Cattle in the Amazon are the obvious example, but cocao beans are a problem in Africa as well, and palm oil virtually anywhere there's a rainforest.
1963 2018-06-11 19:36:47 Looking forward to Dave Collyer, previous Pres & CEO of @OilGasCanada and @Shell Canada , describing "Delivering a Low Carbon Content Oil and Gas Industry" at #CAEACG2018 18/6/2018

1965 2018-06-11 19:36:25 Olive oil is good to cook with when you're trying to bulk up. It's loaded with fats. You could also try to eat bigger meals 3 times a day with plenty of meat/protein. Bread and potatoes and stuff work wonders. (I'm trying to lose weight so it's the opposite. Haha)
1966 2018-06-11 19:36:15 Such a large number of people longing to be duped is a shameful thing for a country. Lack of critical thinking impedes their ability to develop beyond their oil/gas-based economy. Their choice, though - AzeriWorld robots have not achieved self-awareness
1967 2018-06-11 19:36:13 Lets use oil for energy!
Me: Is it clean?
Its the dirtiest thing we can use!
Me: is it cheap?
Its the most expensive thing we can buy!
Me: is there a lot of it?
Its a finite resource whos scarcity will determine the fate of nations!
Me: no alternatives?
Literally an infinite amt!
1968 2018-06-11 19:36:11 Did I really just witness Jamie Oliver put olive oil on ice cream with my own two eyes? Gordon Ramsay would never

1973 2018-06-11 19:35:49 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

1983 2018-06-11 19:35:07 There is no twisting here.. the question is one of living with head held high or one with living in constant fear of being ripped apart by divisive forces being nurtured for political gains by corruption ridden politicians.. I would much rather pay a few rupees more for oil!!
1984 2018-06-11 19:35:05 Los Angeles is a forest of oil wells

1987 2018-06-11 19:34:34 "Not available in stores" = we couldn't convince any retailer to risk selling this snake oil.
1988 2018-06-11 19:34:31 I wonder. Given the number of snake oil salesmen in trumps WH I wonder do his missiles have insides or are they banking that won't challenge thru fear.

1990 2018-06-11 19:34:10 Jamie Oliver is so obsessed with Olive oil he literally puts it on everything including cake and ice cream
1991 2018-06-11 19:33:42 Iran have oil and influence. North Korea are a starving enclave.
1992 2018-06-11 19:33:41 The don't read and since healthcare got reduced to more or less nothing, the batteries in the hearing aid hasn't been changed. Oh and thanks to the trade wars the hearing aid and the batteries never came on those ships because oil is so expensive now.
1993 2018-06-11 19:33:34 Watching Jamie’s quick and easy food and just got VERY angry he put oil over the pudding!! Who does that! To be honest not keen on him since he banned turkey twislers and now this! That’s it!  @jamieoliver
1994 2018-06-11 19:33:10 We export 1.1 million barrels of oil a day.
1995 2018-06-11 19:33:06 I had a dream that "hell" was just smth dead people with a lot of societal influence made up so they could make dead people they disliked experience their deaths over&over..

In the dream I, recently dead, destroyed "hell" and adopted a ghost boy who died falling into an oil well
1996 2018-06-11 19:33:00 All she has to do to get by this ridiculous law is contact a store in california some1 will definitely post it if she pays with her card , and she will get it  !. It's as easy as that believe me  I do this all the time and I can get anything from oil to sweets to cakes
1997 2018-06-11 19:32:58 You inherit a time machine from your weird, scientist uncle. You decide, as any reasonable person would, to use it to make some money. What time period do you travel to, and what snake oil salesman-esque scam do you pull on the people of that time period?
1998 2018-06-11 19:32:39 i get my oil changed at sears when i don’t do it myself 
1999 2018-06-11 19:32:34 Lol,

2005 2018-06-11 19:31:47 @LizClaman perhaps you can explain  why you and other financial news gurus cheer for higher oil prices. Unless you own energy stocks, you are going to be hurt by higher gas prices, higher travel costs, and higher prices for anything product that is transported.
2006 2018-06-11 19:31:46 I agree. Right now it really lacks industry at this point. (so that “extra virgin olive oil” likely won’t be Greek made anyhow )
2007 2018-06-11 19:31:44 Pope needs to tell them to stop selling oil and gas.
2008 2018-06-11 19:31:43 olive oil, salt, pepper and Old Bay seasoning and bbq - delish!

2012 2018-06-11 19:30:57 Crude Oil Price Forecast: Rift Within OPEC May Lead To Higher Prices: A recent plea from Venezuela for Saudi and Russia to hold off on adding to global oil supplies and disruptions from Nigerian exports helped the market see through positioning data as oil trades higher.

Not a stretch to think they are involved here and they do everything for their benefit. Supplied oil to NoKo against sanctions.

2027 2018-06-11 19:29:41 The elites say America can’t afford #MedicareForAll; however it can afford a $230 billion pentagon budget or $40 billion a year for big oil subsidies. I believe this is called #corporateCapture

2036 2018-06-11 19:28:31 The situation was never this bad though.

It's one thing for Obama to say no to an oil pipeline, Trump is going after the Canadian economy as a whole.

2047 2018-06-11 19:27:44 Canola oil, or canola for short, is a vegetable oil derived from rapeseed that is low in erucic acid, as opposed to colza oil. It is also the name of the seed variety that produces it. (Wikipedia)

2050 2018-06-11 19:27:30 Don't kid yourself. Obama was there with the lube and baby oil why Lady Liberty was getting raped and we were all along for the ride.  That ended on November 8, 2016.  I'm glad that fool is not in the White House anymore.
2051 2018-06-11 19:27:25 Last winter my family was sick and I had a drop of oil left. When I was done laying hands on them I still had a drop of oil and they were all healed by the Lord the moment my hands were taken off their heads.

2073 2018-06-11 19:25:16 That's debatable. From story: "This increase appears to be offsetting lower imports from other OPEC countries that have removed oil from the market," Rousseau said, adding that Iraq was likely offsetting potential imports of heavy sour crudes from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

2083 2018-06-11 19:23:50 Dumpf gripes that Canada subsidizes its own industry.

What, ya mean like American Farm Subsidies, or Coal, or Oil, or Timber frm Fed Lands?
2084 2018-06-11 19:23:48 Republicans in control White House again!!! Gas always goes up for their oil buddy’s
2085 2018-06-11 19:23:37 Read up on the trade between US and Canada and get the facts.  The years where Canada had large surpluses to the US were due to Canada selling oil to the US.  Once the US started fracking, the demand for Canadian oil fell.  It has been a pretty good arrangement.
2086 2018-06-11 19:23:37 Hey snake oil salesman make sure you have your rabies shot i hear @SHSanders45  is foaming at the mouth.
2087 2018-06-11 19:23:23 Once we the society, especially the male percentage get the sensitization we desperately need..I'm sure making these ladies feel appreciated and admired irrespective of their skin color will help them immensely both sociologically and psychologically and that's a good start.
2088 2018-06-11 19:23:23 Venezuelan PDVSA's U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum is increasing its efforts to buy crude oil on the open market to compensate for declining supplies from its parent, which is dealing with a severe tanker backlog, traders said on Monday.
2089 2018-06-11 19:23:04 Why has oil come down 10% from its highs last month, but the price of gas has remained 12% higher?
2090 2018-06-11 19:22:52 They have left us, o jari. We are just hear thinking that the world is all a out crude oil, PMB, PDP, yen yen yen yen. Other more serious & focused African countries are leaving us beyond, in the next 10 years, we'll be playing catch-up
2091 2018-06-11 19:22:45 He criticized Bush EPA enforcement retreats, & interference by the Cheney energy task force & EPA's air program, to be sure; but he also commended the enforcement initiatives that did continue (e.g., oil refineries). We'll see how different this is.
2092 2018-06-11 19:21:50 it's the hypocrisy pumping through their veins.  "support the troops-they're out getting fragged for oil."  -but don't support the troops when they come home blown to fkn bits writhing in agony.  i found this story a few months ago, and nvr once saw it on the news.

2113 2018-06-11 19:18:20 This is my own initiative and I've never talked to my vet about it, but I just put a little coconut oil on hot spots. It soothes and acts as a barrier, so she tends to lose interest in scratching/gnawing.
2114 2018-06-11 19:18:17 people can take oil baths so it sinks in their pores & only comes out when they sweat.
2115 2018-06-11 19:18:14 I’ll take avocados, cocoa and coconut oil over white flour and white sugar every time. There is no ‘eating normal brownies’ around here

2147 2018-06-11 19:14:16 #India is probably the largest oil client of #KSA. Furthermore, #India reduced dependency on #Iran in order to boost oil imports from #KSA.

2150 2018-06-11 19:13:48 As @BarackObama talked abt after the gulf coast oil spill disaster, whn he admonished the oil company about paying coastal businesses for their losses, 'How do you claim you can't pay bc you've incurred great loss & yet make more than a $20billion profit?' Don't believe it.
2151 2018-06-11 19:13:38 The union seemed ok with most scots but when oil was discovered Westminster showed its true colours by hiding it from scots.
This is what turned me to independence.

2170 2018-06-11 19:11:33 @POTUS Sir! If the US is self sufficient and likely to be an exporter of oil, why are our oil prices tied to OPEC? We have minimal costs in transporting of our oil from well to refinery. Just curious!

2194 2018-06-11 19:07:52 I agree. A yrs back gas was nearing 5/gallon it was INSANE! Plus, I would get 2 the gas station & have 2 wait in a line of like 4-5 cars!!! My Paw-Paw worked in the oil industry & the US has so many oil sources closed & they try 2 make us think we depend on foreign oil, opinion
2195 2018-06-11 19:07:45 True but oil prices typically peak in May for the summertime driving season. Hopefully we peaked.
2196 2018-06-11 19:07:43 I am told that cannabis oil could improve my life substantially as it has been proven to help those of us who suffer with (chronic pain condition) Fibromyalgia. Guess I won’t get to find out any time soon...

That's a looOong way from here at current sales rates.  Also, Peak Oil is very real, and I never said we were there, only that it's coming.

2254 2018-06-11 19:01:07 Has your energy bill gone up? Heating systems can lose their performance as they age which means your oil or gas heating system may run longer and require more energy to supply the exact same amount of heat.

2257 2018-06-11 19:00:48 My nephew has it. He's now the most moisturized kid in the mid-Atlantic states. I hear coconut oil can be a help. But clearly I'm an internet person and not a doctor. So, um, I'll go now.
2258 2018-06-11 19:00:48 Have you tried putting a translucent powder on your skin before the foundation? It helps absorb the oil
2259 2018-06-11 19:00:27 We have 4 million barrels per day of liquid fuel being transported. There is no shortage. Whether one agrees with spending public money on oil pipelines is the issue. People on all sides of political spectrum are asking this question. #transmountain

2328 2018-06-11 18:52:36 How about suspend it until we have good governance, good enough to ensure the proceeds of oil will build our infrastructure and economy?
2329 2018-06-11 18:52:34 I did this and a rod shot through my engine and through my oil tank. No bueno.
2330 2018-06-11 18:52:28 Imagine Infinity War but like its like Mr. Deeds and Happy Gilmore, and Bobby Bouche and every Adam Sandler character  (all played by Adam Sandler) and like they have to raise money to save an orphanage from an Oil tycoon(Rob Schneider). 

120 million opening weekend
2331 2018-06-11 18:52:26 Putin is by far the richest oil baron on earth. He wouldn't let his employees stand for alternative energy now would he?
2332 2018-06-11 18:52:15 mmm....much as this may 'poop-yer-party'

sexism and racism...*and* loads of pollutants (like DDT....and worse..) were rampant back in those days...and sadly

we still haven't recovered from the heritage of the invention of oil and oil-based-products
(we are all told to "need")
2333 2018-06-11 18:52:12 Chill, it's a joke towards those that complain about the baby oil, it's a smart strategy (the oil) it makes it so people can't grab him.
2334 2018-06-11 18:52:05 I had a recipe for home made pizza sauce over this weekend and it said "1 clove garlic" and I translated that to a literal handful plus some garlic infused olive oil. There is never enough garlic.
2335 2018-06-11 18:52:04 Sweet almond oil and rosehip oil are great because of their high vitamin A content which promotes cell turnover.

2339 2018-06-11 18:51:35 Think all this fuss about Ers, wings,oil burn...is for making Ferrari distraction....so they stop develope the car...great job Binotto :)
2340 2018-06-11 18:51:28 ‘Our side’ is doing what it always does, making friends, cashing in and shaping to control. So was it ever, so shall it ever be. Until there is no oil left to motivate. It’s immoral, but there it is.
2341 2018-06-11 18:50:54 Its almost 4 am. Maybe i should stop working on Oil on Water Burns for tonight
2342 2018-06-11 18:50:54 did you know ive done a large oil painting of the small but knowing yellow clown and it is for sale for $300
2343 2018-06-11 18:50:52 @citizentvkenya let's also take to account beneficial ownership in the oil gas and mining sector and how it would play a big part in improving transparency and sustainability in a country fighting corruption #MondaySpecialKE @usajiliKE
2344 2018-06-11 18:50:52 YALL 

I found some hair oil that been infusing in herbs! I’m 100% sure it been in there more than 3 months. It smell OFFICIAL too!!!!!
2345 2018-06-11 18:50:47 #A1 J75 Northbound exit for the A69 @northumbriapol have closed the slip due to a broken down lorry. The lorry has lost all its oil on the road. #TrafficOfficers & Clean up team en route. Recovery arranged. Diversion is to J76 and then turn back south to exit at J75.
2346 2018-06-11 18:50:38 Romo Markus Solo @MarkSol91165456 apa kabar romo di Vatikan? mohon agar Greja & Vatikan hati2 memutuskan bantuan lobby vatikan agar oil palm tak dibaned UE, jgn sampe vatikan sbg mesin pencuci dosa kapitalis rakus disini, lingkungan dan kondisi sosial jadi rusak. salam romo.
2347 2018-06-11 18:50:21 I wonder what is the future of oil. Maybe we shall achieve peace by doing away with it completely
2348 2018-06-11 18:50:18 More recently the F 35 project, we have wasted $400+ million on that scam so far.
We could be flying modern advanced fighters from our G6 Allies right now.
Remember how US oil was getting moved by our trains this year and our grains weren't?
2349 2018-06-11 18:50:07 US oil production is about 9 million barrels per day;
No tariff is currently in place and the price of oil is $66 per barrel; would seem more of a national security threat than steel? Your crime family taking kick backs from the house of Sa'ud! Your the worst kind of #Predator
2350 2018-06-11 18:49:59 I support oil to be suspended due to banditry in the area
2351 2018-06-11 18:49:51 lol every time i go to get my oil changed they always find something wrong with my car, I BARLEY HAVE MONEY TO AFFORD AN OIL CHANGE
2352 2018-06-11 18:49:48 그렇습니다...저는 따뜻한 원고러,.,.
2353 2018-06-11 18:49:42 No troops don't fight for the people, they fight for UK corporations in foreign countries, so politicians and shareholders make money from oil opium and other resources.
2354 2018-06-11 18:49:41 Unfortunately, lot of people confuse land that was once forest & land that never seceded 2 forest. Yes land that was forest like that destroyed 4 palm oil, coffee, soy, cattle should b restored. Agroforestry is 1 way to do it where value can still b derived from some of that land
2355 2018-06-11 18:49:39 Oil, egg yolk, vinegar.... nasty
2356 2018-06-11 18:49:31 Okay let’s add an oil into your routine. Replace the azelaic acid for a little while with 1 of these oils:

- TO Borage Seed Oil
- TO Chia Seed Oil
- TO Squalane 
- Now Sweet Almond Oil
- Now Grapeseed Oil
2357 2018-06-11 18:49:30 My point was that the article  claims he is taking CBD oil, he is NOT! He's taking medical marijuana. Miss information on the part of @SkyNews not myself, as I stated earlier CBD oil is legal in this country.
The story is misleading, not my input!
2358 2018-06-11 18:49:27 Tell him data is the new oil, maybe this will catch his interest. :trollface:
2359 2018-06-11 18:49:25 91.3FM The Edge is playing "Oil And Water [Album Version]" by Incubus.
2360 2018-06-11 18:49:14 It's a pore filling primer not a oil controlling/mattifying primer.
2361 2018-06-11 18:49:13 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2362 2018-06-11 18:49:13 Boek sifu.but bio oil mcm berminyak and lmbt kan?
2363 2018-06-11 18:49:04 Reminiscing about this weird manager i once had and he nicknamed me the pink assasin. And also gave me and @XLXVXX  free drinks for doing dares like drinking household products and chip oil and snorting chilli powder. How was that allowed?
2364 2018-06-11 18:48:57 Coconut oil for my skin does wonders My body is smooth then a mf 
2365 2018-06-11 18:48:53 They are right.What is the essence of transporting the oil when the residents aren't secure? I support the leaders for this move.
2366 2018-06-11 18:48:52 RECIPE:
Chicken sausage
Onion
Onion powder
Onion salt
Mrs. Dash
Jarred garlic (not the fresh crap)
Any veggie you like
A hint of oil spray
1/2 cup water

Add all ingredients to the pan. Boil until gross. Eat and enjoy!
2367 2018-06-11 18:48:48 What are the chances that Putin/Pruitt/Zinke decide to drill for oil there and Trump/McConnell/Ryan just standby and let our country continue to get f***ed?  Feels pretty likely right now.
2368 2018-06-11 18:48:45 Spent the past year learning how the Taiga and rainforest are adapted to their climate... And Edexcel is wanting me to talk about how palm oil makes fucking ice cream...    #edexcelgeography
2369 2018-06-11 18:48:45 I guess it wasn't a coincidence that I was trying to get business docs for a multi billion $ Russian oil company haha
2370 2018-06-11 18:48:41 I also help my oldest pay for college pay alimony and a car and insurance and finishing up my student loans Plus health care and dental for three kids
2371 2018-06-11 18:48:38 With the exception of a few countries in the Middle East and perhaps, Russia, Crude Oil has been more of a curse than a blessing. 
Most nations that have this liquid gold have experienced the worst forms of recession, extreme poverty and corrupt practices. It's bewildering.
2372 2018-06-11 18:48:37 I paid $400 copay for an mri. It’s called life.
2373 2018-06-11 18:48:31 Surprised at the number of Oil proffessionals who have suddenly sprung up in Kenya yet we haven't sold a single barrel leave alone other vital factors!!
2374 2018-06-11 18:48:28 i urge the interior cs 4 internal security fred matiangi to stabilize security in the areas bordering turkana county 4 a more safer and proper operations within oil barrels.
2375 2018-06-11 18:48:28 Is it possible she could be from a race of telepaths??
2376 2018-06-11 18:48:25 This oil story sounds really interesting
2377 2018-06-11 18:48:17 I cld be t person w a wardrobe, of robes for each day of the week. The spell of social media confirms my frustrations, exposing t suffering in our. No longer a movie. Africa is a perfect x diamonds, cost more than oil? Thinking, A Bourdain worldly exp speak volumes.
2378 2018-06-11 18:48:13 Thank you to the boy who gifted me the luxurious red rose bath oil 

Thank you so much 
2379 2018-06-11 18:48:08 They should be suspended because the area is insecure for settlement due to banditry mostly the oil mining sub county, government to intervene on that.
2380 2018-06-11 18:48:01 I need a full body oil massage ASMFP
2381 2018-06-11 18:47:58 I chipped in! I’ve cared about this issue for years now. I hope it gets more traction. I always read labels and actively avoid products that use palm oil. It might as well be blood
2382 2018-06-11 18:47:53 Yard done. Kids played in the pool. Cleaned off roof. Took out a wasp nest. Car oil changed. Groceries bought. I think it’s #beerthirty
2383 2018-06-11 18:47:30 @citizentvkenya to move away from the oil curse we must also think of domestic investments @AnneKiguta #MondaySpecialKE
2384 2018-06-11 18:47:27 And oil is down .... crooks
2385 2018-06-11 18:47:25 Nothing’s better than one fresh from the oil
2386 2018-06-11 18:47:19 Make sure you boys oil up! 

For safety! #DEFYLoud
2387 2018-06-11 18:47:17 Is this the flood of the people coming up from the  underground wonderland who have been bled for the Elite's sake? Bloody OIL!
2388 2018-06-11 18:47:16 Yeah you put tanning oil on you deserve to burn, I however was wearing spf 30
2389 2018-06-11 18:47:13 Use a higher quality oil, one with a higher burn point. This will solve your problem.
2390 2018-06-11 18:47:11 Watch that sun exposure  unless yer a fan of wrinkled, leather like skin when your older.
2391 2018-06-11 18:47:06 Devacurl everything. @bpal Dorian :( Embryolisse moisturizer & Nuxe body oil.
2392 2018-06-11 18:47:02 Lol  if we are to Judge by standard of prisons .. then Norway, Finland will be on top Saudi is not near.. there are places in Saudi Arabia with Abject poverty especially the eastern oil region and Yemen border.
2393 2018-06-11 18:46:57 Palm oil rice > fried rice
2394 2018-06-11 18:46:55 Ran out of tanning oil with like 4 days left 
2395 2018-06-11 18:46:55 @citizentvkenya @annkiguta #MondaySpecialKE I did not expect the oil to be seen at negative side this early let's enjoy its first products
2396 2018-06-11 18:46:53 washed my hair yesterday using olive oil shampoo, tea tree oil, cantu leave in conditioner, Doo Gro leave in treatment and then I used olive oil before using the blow dryer and lastly I used shea butter lite creme
2397 2018-06-11 18:46:51 Annual minimum wage is just over $500. What we currently earn per head in oil is very much less than that.
I'm not sure how people think Nigeria is rich or what they think makes her rich, because Nigeria currently has the largest number of very poor people in a single country 
2398 2018-06-11 18:46:46 You try supermarket shopping with no plastic. It's impossible. I try to cut down plastic and palm oil, and I could be there all day reading labels if I had time. Make the supermarkets change, and do it fast.
2399 2018-06-11 18:46:44 Sa motor naman change oil,tuneup,linening,block,cam,curb,laybor
2400 2018-06-11 18:46:43 I saw this on the news earlier and it made me so angry! Self inflicted druggies get handed methadone to keep them alive & comfortable, it’s ridiculous this lad isn’t allowed the cannabis oil that basically keeps him alive.
2401 2018-06-11 18:46:42 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
2402 2018-06-11 18:46:33 @stephenfry I just watched your documentary on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

:( watch your doc again and pause precisely at 1:25 into the film.

The image is of the rupture, directly over a bolted flange.

BP could have installed a valve right there but chose not to.
2403 2018-06-11 18:46:32 I haven’t put any oil on my dreads since i started them
2404 2018-06-11 18:46:27 Rice price up 3% , oil up , dollar up , bond yeilds up . The markets were undecisive today  dow is also consolidating before fed meet (1/2)
2405 2018-06-11 18:46:25 Oil change and I’m heading back alone for the summer life’s much better on a boat

2407 2018-06-11 18:46:01 As greedy as we are ,the oil curse is inevitable. @citizentvkenya #MondaySpecialKE
2408 2018-06-11 18:45:54 I wonder if chips ever wake up and smell the oil...?
2409 2018-06-11 18:45:50 Those who speak about oil prices high should stop using vehicles for some days.
Those who can't use it.
Help country grow.
Normal man if you can throw money at eating outside. If some is used through taxes in petrol what is the harm.
#BJP
2410 2018-06-11 18:45:36 @IHOb Changing to burgers doesn't mean they care anymore about  people. IF you saw how thes ebig companies produced their food with the added sugar, salt, crap oil, etc. you'd get sick before even eating it!
#eatlocal #local #paleo #fitness #health #organic #farmfresh
2411 2018-06-11 18:45:27 Most of the Nigerian oil money has been laundered through London and Paris.... Don't blame the refugees for following their money!
2412 2018-06-11 18:45:24 It’s great to be acknowledged for our greatness at last we didn’t know you knew so much about us lol gI’m glad it’s been my home for 17 years now. Wouldn’t change it for the world. The beauty of the mountains.wildlife and no trump. You liked out oil till now too 
2413 2018-06-11 18:45:19 It may be significant that (from my humble OP) there's been nary a peep from new Chair of the Fed.

Gas prices up will squeeze profits but prices did not come down from last peak; all profit. Good shape and, domestic oil flush hopefully making real (re)development hiring trades.
2414 2018-06-11 18:45:12 You think
2415 2018-06-11 18:45:06 Ukraine is leading the right action against the #WorldCup in Russia, 
but you do not need to exaggerate and fall into a tantrum: 
Merkel sees Putin as Gaddafi, 
shameless Europe buys oil from Tyrant, 
but cunning Europe will lynch Tyrant as soon as he weakens
.
2416 2018-06-11 18:44:58 how close I am to kicking this guy out of my shop for talking to my guys with such disrespect! If you know how to change the oil do it your dam self or let my guys do their job
2417 2018-06-11 18:44:57 I wonder the investment impact if Govt  said all current PSC terms will be used for any deepwater developments that can get first oil before 2026
2418 2018-06-11 18:44:52 Was the oil dropped in the corner then. It looked like Michael Rutter and Davo took an odd line giving them a major slapper but I'm guessing that was the oil dropped
2419 2018-06-11 18:44:50 And don’t forget the maintenance savings! No oil changes, head gaskets, etc
2420 2018-06-11 18:44:46 I really really want some Oil  who am I?!
2421 2018-06-11 18:44:45 CBS news announced early morning that "Gas is going to $4" while NPR says "gas is going down, because oil" I think that CBS analysts know that 30% of US oil comes from Canada, because Venezuela is embargoed
2422 2018-06-11 18:44:38 Hey guys, just sitting in my chones hanging out with my cat plotting world domination while I sip on my CBD oil infused smoothie. Happy Monday to all
2423 2018-06-11 18:44:33 Asian countries with huge trade surpluses have better airports, high speed rail and better general infrastructure. Wonder why
2424 2018-06-11 18:44:33 Yes my dear you and I are saying the same thing. @realDonaldTrump values his wealth than human lives same as @EmmanuelMacron value his politics over the millions of lives of #SouthernCameroonians same with @theresa_may & @NewAgeLtd who value Oil over our lives in #Ambazonia
2425 2018-06-11 18:44:28 AND THEN SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED WHEN GETTING MY OIL CHANGED. Ugh. Why is this my life. 
2426 2018-06-11 18:44:25 It’s always a good day when you get your oil changed for free 
2427 2018-06-11 18:44:18 @citizentvkenya it's great that we have struck gold in oil, but we are in the Holocene series and thinking of resilient human sustainability should be our priority #MondaySpecialKE @AnneKiguta
2428 2018-06-11 18:44:10 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2429 2018-06-11 18:44:05 @smittyyy_65 oil, fire, door 
2430 2018-06-11 18:43:59 Sure it is.
2431 2018-06-11 18:43:53 Kiels facial fuel wash, pixi glow tonic toner, seriously shine free mattifying oil free moisturizer
2432 2018-06-11 18:43:29 Damn near broke my elbow doing that backpack kid dance. I am no longer one of da yute dem. Also, my knee caps need oil. Man get the strap 
2433 2018-06-11 18:43:23 Lets see if we can distill this. Russian and Saudis would like to remain net exporters of oil.  In kissing their arses, Trump tariffs solar so americans forced to use oil for energy and fall behind, in a smoggy, overheated rest of the world
2434 2018-06-11 18:43:21 #funkmusic Tower Of Power #towerofpower from the Urban Renewal album Only So Much Oil In The Ground
2435 2018-06-11 18:43:20 Can I get this as an oil painting?
2436 2018-06-11 18:43:10 They get very little from us anyways. It's single digit percentages of our oil. Canada, however, gets 60% of their oil from us. They don't want to get in that war..
2437 2018-06-11 18:43:10 Imma get my oil changed on Fredericksburg first but then ill swing by send me that Address!
2438 2018-06-11 18:43:09 Yes deedee.  Haitian castor oil been the truth !!
2439 2018-06-11 18:43:01 I can imagine the slogans and cliches rolling off his lips like used oil from an Edsel.
2440 2018-06-11 18:42:44 Her Instagram is filled with Travel.  NYC area is expensive I support three kids here and pay for my healthcare maybe how about not travel and pay for healthcare i know wild solution wild
2441 2018-06-11 18:42:36 I been at this oil change place 2 damn Hours 
2442 2018-06-11 18:42:32 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
2443 2018-06-11 18:42:31 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2444 2018-06-11 18:42:20 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
2445 2018-06-11 18:42:20 But he gets results. 🖒#maga 
2446 2018-06-11 18:42:13 cracking open a juul and tossing it into my essential oil diffuser (for my haters)
2447 2018-06-11 18:42:11 No but i have facts: We bomb them, they become orphans with problems, get recruited by ISIS.
And our 'patriots' attack the police, not the ones bombing and creating extremists. Blair? should of been jailed instantly, here is facts that matter, war is oil, profit, you pay more ;)
2448 2018-06-11 18:41:31 Believe me it's a real struggle for them dark skinned sisters..u think you know what it's all about but u have to be in their position to really get it..I'm not saying it's ok to bleach but let's cut them some slack.
2449 2018-06-11 18:41:29 OMG Panner butter masala dosai is the worst!! We also have boori masala as a revenge. You can take an oil bath with the boooris 
2450 2018-06-11 18:41:18 Education and @TomiLahren are as synonymous as crude oil and olive oil.
2451 2018-06-11 18:41:10 So just to get this straight. @mandy_velez said “FU America” because “America” is not paying more of her healthcare costs and she’s being forced to pay her own bills.

Imagine being that entitled
2452 2018-06-11 18:40:48 The pope underestimates the depravity of oil executives.
2453 2018-06-11 18:40:26 Art implies nuance. This man is about as nuanced as a quart of oil.

2455 2018-06-11 18:40:22 To be a great company you don’t just need great prices you need superb customer service @opieoils is that company! If anyone needs any oil, filters etc check them out. A small order error and top class resolution of the problem. #fantasticcustomerservice
2456 2018-06-11 18:40:21 every day Trump opens his mouth, Mitch Mcconnell subscibes to the #NYT
2457 2018-06-11 18:40:12 Rees Mogg is no patriot Otto. It's all about the money and power. Follow the gold, oil trail.
2458 2018-06-11 18:40:09 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
2459 2018-06-11 18:40:06 Never heard of it. Clay masks are generally good for absorbing oil
2460 2018-06-11 18:40:05 Been my preferred cooking oil all my adult life tho. #irony
2461 2018-06-11 18:40:02 1.   Separating children from their families, who are at our borders seeking asylum.

2462 2018-06-11 18:40:00 You do not need to convince the consumers .... the “leaders” of the oil rich countries are to educated and convinced to invest in renewable energy ...
2463 2018-06-11 18:39:59 Waiting on John getting back but he is quite certain its CBD oil with 2,4 and up to 10% (or maybe it's mg) THC. I'm wondering if EU regulations allow small amounts as a coffee shop recently opened in France (Paris I think) and they are selling #cannabis with low dose THC!!

2467 2018-06-11 18:39:24 Canada needs to turn off the flow of oil, water, electricity,  softwood lumber, intellectuals, etc
2468 2018-06-11 18:39:23 The thing with energy you got to sift through the zealouts of the peak oil theories and the anti fossil fuels and be rational in the between a bit like our skewed partisan news in the US - easy for rich people in the west to champion either cause :)
2469 2018-06-11 18:39:19 Funny how every other oil producer managed to increase their output during the price drop. Only Venezuela couldn't stick with it. Why? Because socialism is weak AF.

2471 2018-06-11 18:38:52 We’ve discussed this triangle w customers for a couple yrs now and have heard 2x in past yr that this triangle will likely ultimately force KSA to sell oil to China in CNY.
2472 2018-06-11 18:38:37 it's not something to use on your door hinges, and will in fact strip all the good lubricant off of most of the things you want it to lubricate. For lubricating stuff around the house all you need is a can of 3-in-1 oil and a can of white lithium grease.
2473 2018-06-11 18:38:36 Mike Fulmer brought his truck into the shop today for a oil change.  Real nice guy.
2474 2018-06-11 18:38:23 The entire spill was contained and never reached any water. Its still the safest transport for oil. This is why bullshit wanna be environmentalist don’t make decisions.
2475 2018-06-11 18:38:05 Why do cars gotta be so expensive??!! A synthetic oil change is like $80 
2476 2018-06-11 18:37:54 Coconut oil is A1 that’s why
2477 2018-06-11 18:37:53 Oil prices increased by PKR 4.26. EID Gift... Where is the so called media now, who previously considered it’s prime responsibility to target the govt on it??? #ARYNews #DunyaNews #BOLNews

2480 2018-06-11 18:37:43 If @JustinTrudeau can flip the bird to DT he should flip off Big Oil
2481 2018-06-11 18:37:32 Got it completely wrong the oil crisis in the seventies was global. we had shit management who wanted to take away workers rights they didn't like workers getting a fair share of the pie. Germany on the other hand chose to work with unions they still have good well paid jobs
2482 2018-06-11 18:37:16 Don't forget also coal got massacred as did oil so big rise but came off - reality is pollution concerns etc mean higher prices in the meantime from demand that should also speed up alternative sources
2483 2018-06-11 18:37:14 I use Emu soap on my face made right here in NB.  The Emu oil, also locally made is wonderful for strengthening finger nails.

2497 2018-06-11 18:35:10 I think that @realDonaldTrump seems to use the oil market as a levy for his own gas, produced in America. He fails to recognize the dangers of playing with oil, and that has been the cause for a major fall of a barrel of oil in enterprises such as @TotalGhana

2522 2018-06-11 18:31:51 Or possibly a result of "News?"

2535 2018-06-11 18:29:58 I do real business with people in Venezuela, so take your uneducated MAGA talking points elsewhere. If you care to learn, it’s political corruption and the crashing price of oil causing the issues there. I doubt you do, so bye.

2564 2018-06-11 18:25:58 Yeah, to sell you hydrogen they cracked from fossil fuel chains.

2571 2018-06-11 18:24:57 Recipe sounds familiar. I do recommend adding a touch of oil to pan before the initial butter, as an insurance policy against butter burn. I usually use bacon or sausage grease from my #IssuedToSoutherner grease jar.
2572 2018-06-11 18:24:57 I concentrate on the noises in the room, then the senses of my body, then my breathing, then try to stick to just that concentrating on my breath - shutting down the inner voice - the chatter - going back to the breath concentration.  Some lavender (pure grade) oil on temples.

2577 2018-06-11 18:24:32 no it isn't and you know it. This is too easy.

2587 2018-06-11 18:23:45 The request by Turkana MPs to deal with bandits before transporting oil is a very valid point they've raised. Insecurity is not to be taken lightly.
2588 2018-06-11 18:23:25 That's a selfish and self-serving perspective, especially when put up against the time and effort that goes into the rest of the development. Looking forward to an England-set Tomb Raider, with all the oil fields and big buckles and everyone firing guns and going "Yeehaw."
2589 2018-06-11 18:22:40 Trump Iran Deal withdrawal raises oil price and hurts Americans and benefits Putin / Russia.  No reason to pull out - Trump does a favor for Putin.    Another tax ( hidden) on working Americans!

2603 2018-06-11 18:21:14 Dude at valvoline just plugged me with the oil change, only paid $20 
2604 2018-06-11 18:21:03 Por último o petróleo e o gás da Líbia garantem a independência energética em relação a Rússia. Os investimentos privados no Oil&Gas e nas infraestruturas necessárias vão dar emprego a muitos europeus e a muitos líbios. E só precisamos de ampliar a operação italiana 4/
2605 2018-06-11 18:21:01 A guy about 60 sat next to me at the bus station commented on my tan and proceeded to tell me he used to wear it body building and also used to oil himself up. Get me home. Now.
2606 2018-06-11 18:20:54 Had some oil delivery truck blow through there the wrong way the other day. I now want an armed guard and traffic spikes. :)
2607 2018-06-11 18:20:40 wait a second. I don’t work with u.
2608 2018-06-11 18:20:38 Well Afghanistan and Syria are not huge oil nations. Which shows that its more about Influence than recources. When the Shah was in power US had no need for any millitary activities in the Persian Gulf . The Shah managed to do that. The US just needs guarantees for its influence.
2609 2018-06-11 18:20:35 Oil Prices fell, pulled down by rising Russian production and the highest U.S. drilling activity in more than three years.
2610 2018-06-11 18:20:27 Trump is right about including Russia. Future will prove him right.
2611 2018-06-11 18:20:21 Instead of baby lotion imma rub my baby down in holy oil lmfao just joking
2612 2018-06-11 18:20:18 Not the oil has a rich patina and fluid sensuousness that can you only be real
2613 2018-06-11 18:20:12 I'll try some lubricant first and report back. Not sure what kind you use, was thinking of trying either WD40, gun oil or lithium
2614 2018-06-11 18:20:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2615 2018-06-11 18:19:58 Deifference between 
virgin coconut oil 
AND 
organic coconut oil?
2616 2018-06-11 18:19:58 Maybe it was something in his conditioning beard oil and all will quickly be resolved.
2617 2018-06-11 18:19:57 Sometimes I sit and think and I’m actually scared to know how my baby will act. Like it’s 2 of the worse kind of crazy has made a child. IT makes me nervous. That’s why I keep my oil close.
2618 2018-06-11 18:19:43 @BareBiology I can't believe how good your fish oil tastes  Hands down the best fish oil supplement I've ever tried 
2619 2018-06-11 18:19:39 Agenda:

2620 2018-06-11 18:19:13 @PauleyP United Houma nations are trying so hard to be recognized as Native American Indian Tribe.  Government keeps denying them. Their land has not only been taken from them but what they do have has become a toxic waste land. they were heavily affected by that gulf oil spill.
2621 2018-06-11 18:19:12 I'm sure there are effective alternative sources of fertiliser that I've not heard of because oil is cheap and no one cares enough. 

My neighbour kept a vat of basically nettle stew, seaweed works great for potatoes, etc.
2622 2018-06-11 18:19:06 I'll saute his hate & anger with a bit of garlic & olive oil and serve it as a side dish. Liberal outrage is just delicious!

2626 2018-06-11 18:18:36 Good point, it's just I hear all this doomsday talk about tariffs but like to know how much exchange rate plays into it - for example when CDN$ goes up a cent CDN oil producers lose millions as does tax revenues - how does it effect steel & aluminium industry - I assume the same

2628 2018-06-11 18:18:14 I was able to finally build one of the two bunkers, thanks to this event. Was hoping to also upgrade the factory but I still far behind in upgrading my oil wells to level 3. Thanks again for a oil related event it helped big time.
2629 2018-06-11 18:18:11 No one gives a damn about 70s inflation except that it might come back to UK if we leave. Different industrial sectors with different elasticities, different interconnectedness, dependence on imported oil etc. We can discuss Brexit's effect on inflation after you give a gain.
2630 2018-06-11 18:18:05 oil companies are running amok and the EPA is f’d
2631 2018-06-11 18:17:55 @MeghanHughes meg what brand of coconut oil do you use? I know it was in one of your vids but I forget which one lol

Not sure if you support the world wide Islamic oil cartel (OPEC) or if you believe in freedom from WAR for Oil & Islam Do you WANT Korea - China to dominate the future transportation? If not only buy US EVs
2634 2018-06-11 18:17:47 If I were rich I’d make the Mona Lisa into a salad, drench it in olive oil.
2635 2018-06-11 18:17:43 Most experts believe that the RSPO is useless and corrupt. Nothing sustainable about #palmoil You're pretending to be green, swimming in $$$ all while using palm oil destroying habitat and animals. Epic BS. I won't buy your products.
2636 2018-06-11 18:17:37 Yep raisetge oil prices and make them suffer! They will love us when we off shore drill!
2637 2018-06-11 18:17:25 Why don’t we have a yearly vehicle safety inspection or every two years or something that includes this test for all vehicles in Alberta? There are some jacked up trucks with mudders out there shooting rocks at us that don’t meet road requirements either and oil burning beaters!
2638 2018-06-11 18:17:19 Now not required just cake premix, water , oil & eggs.
2639 2018-06-11 18:17:17 Not only a problem of pipe but also a problem of type of oil... LTO market is floaded... that's why US cannot export above 2 million bar. with regularity!
2640 2018-06-11 18:17:16 Just nuke the middle east have the androids work the oil wells
2641 2018-06-11 18:17:12 Because your country likes wars trump! More dollars for arms ! Oil ! Oil ! Oil! America don't rule the world no more
2642 2018-06-11 18:17:12 So an oil change and alignment don't get me a loaner car at the dealership but an oil change, alignment AND complementary car wash does 
2643 2018-06-11 18:17:10 @HotelChocolat do you use palm oil in any of your products please?
2644 2018-06-11 18:17:05 Thanks man. Ill be in to get my free birthday quart of oil

2647 2018-06-11 18:16:43 That guy’s make-up artist should win American citizenship, free time-share at Lake Tahoe, year’s supply of chicken wings at KFC, and a free oil change at Pep-Boys. She achieved more for American fair trade then anyone!!! Trump’s secret agent, perhaps??
2648 2018-06-11 18:16:37 I just steam and drizzle in olive oil and lemon.. was demolished by girls and Students tonight. Work our way to the Centre prize 
2649 2018-06-11 18:16:36 @JustinTrudeau It is time Canada built its own oil refineries. Then the USA would not be doing it and selling it back to you causing Canadians to pay outrageous prices for fuel.
2650 2018-06-11 18:15:56 Tea tree oil saved my life

almost 21/2 hrs. Better take it to the Quick Lube for future oil change. Not recommended 
2655 2018-06-11 18:15:43 I keep lagging on this oil change 
2656 2018-06-11 18:15:42 While there may be concerns that all the benefits of psilocybin sound like snake oil, Matthew Johnson suggests its benefits are a result of an overarching addiction mechanism #CPDD18
2657 2018-06-11 18:15:34 And the inflation rate has fallen world wide. You really can't take the 70's as a comparator, OPEC oil shocks made it a very high inflation decade.
2658 2018-06-11 18:15:24 How, go on tell me how we are screwing the US, you have a trade surplus with us, you buy discounted oil from us (by the way, that's my business).  We lend you support after 9-11, etc etc, so how are we screwing you?
2659 2018-06-11 18:15:15 Honestly its the oil...wait until it runs out...no one will give 2 shits if the mid east burns...next war is in Latin American mines...sadly this is the energy crises we reside in.

OIL！
2670 2018-06-11 18:13:44 This is exactly your party.  This is the party of Reagan's dog-whistles about welfare queens, disastrous trickle-down economics; Bush's wars for oil and recession; Sarah Palin's incompetence - on steroids. The end result.
2671 2018-06-11 18:13:39 What's the surprise? Saudi Arabia is the same and I do not see any country bashing them, as long as they keep buying from them and selling oil...
2672 2018-06-11 18:13:36 How does what you just said refute what she said?  As though both leaders wouldn’t kill some people. Or that Russia didn’t want to get American oil companies to expand into Siberia.
2673 2018-06-11 18:13:35 The title suggests that for a country to have 'insignificant' oil reserves, it's somehow a handicap. Small but adequate reserves provide insulation from oil price fluctuations, especially if a refinery is in place, big deposits breed dependance
2674 2018-06-11 18:13:30 ... migration will end when the economic diffrences ebb out. We can achieve this by stopping th exploitation of the countries of origin (hint: nigerian oil!) or by ruining the countries of destination (hint #brexshit!)
2675 2018-06-11 18:13:29 hi, little update on my life... I had to get my oil changed without my mom being by my side. if this is adulthood, count me out
2676 2018-06-11 18:13:25 HB2154 is a dangerous bill that would “undo regulations providing basic environmental and health protections” as well as “severely limit PA’s ability to oversee the oil and gas industry,” warns @headbreather in @PoconoRecord.
2677 2018-06-11 18:13:24 I'm just like that :) Don't mind me. That will work decently though. If you need to reheat fries, pizza pan in the oven, light misting with cooking oil.
2678 2018-06-11 18:13:21 I've started using makeup wipes morning and before bed just to remove dirt/oil. Been seeing a big difference and face washes/scrubs usually just irritate my skin.

2682 2018-06-11 18:13:07 You have past experience of doing something similar. First you started off with plagiarism. That thing didn't work out for you, hence you joined OIC. Now you own a huge oil field in Bahrain.

All are facing a fundamental shift in consumer behavior that directly threatens their core products (drop in engagement, intentional move away from oil, rise of ride-sharing and eventually self-driving).

2690 2018-06-11 18:12:20 Yeah I know. My family has small business owners. Small business and the private sector pay for everything in the private sector. Fine. The Ford guy and the Trump guy forget however that some of us in the private sector don't like debt esp subsidizing business like oil and gas.

2697 2018-06-11 18:11:50 This is such a shame. I’m a big essential oil fan & nurse. I use them mainly for headaches, stress, sleep, cleaning, etc. It takes a lot of personal research-they are not supposed to replace meds. They are meant to be added to one’s routine & enhance their lifestyle- not harm.
2698 2018-06-11 18:11:43 Best thing about a lifted truck is not having to jack it up to change yer oil

2700 2018-06-11 18:11:29 It’s embarrassing the GOP has allowed this snake oil salesman to hijack & represent their party. They are watching (or complicit) in the damage he’s inflicting & it’s going to take them many years to live him down - if they survive. This is appalling on a global level.

2709 2018-06-11 18:10:35 it's primarily a solvent that due to its low viscosity doubles as a penetrating oil. It leaves behind a sticky coating that can inhibit rust but in practice just attracts dirt. It's actually really good as a cutting fluid for aluminum.

2721 2018-06-11 18:09:47 And as the article points out, our crude is loaded with sulphur and there are new International regulations for sulfur content of fuels. This, not just the lack of a pipeline  is what is pushing the price of Canadian oil down.

2727 2018-06-11 18:09:20 I have looked for it since,  but I can't find it. For oil, though, the process is called abiotic ouil.

2741 2018-06-11 18:07:26 Can you imagine if a POTUS told it like it was? "We have done unspeakable things as a nation. We are not all powerful. Our oil will eventually run out. Parts of our country will soon be unlivable. We need to deal with these things TODAY." 

They'd be voted out in a heartbeat. 
2742 2018-06-11 18:07:15 Lemme get this oil change first
2743 2018-06-11 18:07:07 Doesn’t make sense. UK government to maintain that cannabis has no medicinal uses. At the same time as having the world’s biggest medical cannabis farm. They exported 2 tonnes of green over the world last year. But they take CBD oil from #billycaldwell??
2744 2018-06-11 18:07:07 OPEC president: US hasn't asked us for more oil
2745 2018-06-11 18:07:06 #RBD presenting at oil conference on 14th. Likely to stimulate more interest here.
2746 2018-06-11 18:07:03 Smoke a vape of cannabis oil.
2747 2018-06-11 18:07:03 OMFG lolol Thank you so much for buying my stamp!!! They are reuse-able so u can replace the ink with any oil based ink once it runs out!
2748 2018-06-11 18:06:33 I will never buy food again!!! I bought this cooking oil yesterday n already is half, are you guys anointing yourselves with? Or how he sent me to the kitchen to fetch something weird whenever the kissing scene appears #clicksdadjokes 
2749 2018-06-11 18:06:32 I keep trying to explain to people that when I was young, we had chips, mac 'n cheese, peanut butter, oleo, etc. without palm oil. Where are all those #AmericaFirst people when it comes to supporting US farmers?
2750 2018-06-11 18:06:31 And who has been stacking the courts in the meantime?
2751 2018-06-11 18:06:24 When there is peer reviewed, non anecdotal evidence that the oil is of medical value?
2752 2018-06-11 18:06:23 I can’t believe how much olive oil I’ve consumed
2753 2018-06-11 18:06:22 marihuana honey oil and even vitamin c and oil of oragano ligitimately defeat any cancer. chin up!
2754 2018-06-11 18:06:16 98% is your fault, Your govt has a history violence, fraud, killings, torture, corruption and briber. You are worst trouble maker on earth, the worst corrupt people on, worst devilish on. I charge you guilty. Leave #Ambazonia oil and gas, women and children, infact leave Africa
2755 2018-06-11 18:06:12 Is it bad that the only important day I actually remember is my boyfriends birthday only cause it’s the day I have to get my oil changed in my car?
2756 2018-06-11 18:05:59 If he has glaucoma he should try cannabis oil vaporizers it heals/treats it ;>
2757 2018-06-11 18:05:50 I disagree.
The Rockefellers aren't worried about the environment.
They're worried that our oil will go somewhere else but the USA.
They want it right where they can get at it.
When they want it.
Our reserves are considered part of the US strategic reserves.
Why wouldn't they?
2758 2018-06-11 18:05:41 If Graham ever runs out of cooking oil for a fried egg, he can always use some from his hair! #Emmerdale
2759 2018-06-11 18:05:37 "Last year, Billy became the 1st child to be prescribed medicinal cannabis oil on the NHS. He then reportedly went 250 days without a seizure. However, his GP was later ordered by Home Office not to renew the prescription or face disbarment."
Why @sajidjavid ?
2760 2018-06-11 18:04:52 The article doesn't mention one important fact that's often only mentioned in the boardrooms of big oil:- only these companies know the actual reserves and they release this  info as and when it suits their share prices 1/2
2761 2018-06-11 18:04:41 I thought one of the current aims of USA was preventing any iranian-backed proxy to manage the oil fields...

2763 2018-06-11 18:04:20 great, another completely unacceptable choice for cabinet pick. of course big oil is involved. wonder how much 45 made from this pick? our natl parks, animals, and environment need our help more than ever.
2764 2018-06-11 18:04:19 Cheaters, murderers... 
#dieselgate isn't over yet. 
How many more will have to die  from pollution from oil burned in cars.
2765 2018-06-11 18:04:18 Fuck off why is palm oil in fucking everything
2766 2018-06-11 18:03:52 Went out to get groceries on my own for the first time in over a year  but bought sweets with palm oil in them  (kinda impossible not to, they all do). You win some battles and lose others. #mentalhealth
2767 2018-06-11 18:03:49 @Oreo please stop putting palm oil in your cookies. Oreos used to be my favorite snack but I can't in good conscience eat them anymore when I know that it is contributing to the extinction of orangutans.
2768 2018-06-11 18:03:27 Just made this essential oil spray for my hair while I’m at camp  Coconut oil, Aloe Vera, Black Castor oil, tea tree oil , and a dab of lavender witch hazel IT SMELLS SO GOOD !!!!!!!! These braids will be moist and poppin all mf summer long OKKKUR

2770 2018-06-11 18:03:11 I don’t even do anything to my brows anymore. I just throw castor oil on them bitches & call it a day

2775 2018-06-11 18:02:27 Top of the hour: OIL 15M has another 3rd leg up possible, but it's flattening, low momentum. WATCH 
NATGAS 1H VOLATILITY ON just now. WATCH direction pending.
USD/GOLD hold neutral now through the rest of the day.
SPX melts up, crawls, grinds higher.
2776 2018-06-11 18:02:11 If you look at it in regards to the tariffs in relation to our low dollar our steel becomes the same cost as "American" steel and aluminum is still cheaper than made in US aluminum I believe like oil price of these commodities is in US dollar
2777 2018-06-11 18:02:10 don't buy it. When it starts consuming oil at a large rate they wont stand behind the product and fix it.  They will bill you or tell you to just buy a new one.
2778 2018-06-11 18:02:05 You seriously think we'd get triple A as a small new country with no credit history, a declining oil sector, no workable currency, a £10 billion a year deficit to pay down and £5 billion a year to pay for ongoing UK services? Get aaf the Buckie.

2790 2018-06-11 18:01:02 Do you know what they are doing in Venezuela ? And when I say “they” I mean the US/CIA/Big Oil. The fact that socialism has never been allowed to take root
2791 2018-06-11 18:00:57 When looking at #SaudiArabia's oil production for June, July and August bear in mind the hot summer  months where output normally goes up every year. #OOTT #opec

2796 2018-06-11 18:00:34 1) The U.S. should stop importing Canadian oil. They don't need it anymore. Then they should stop exporting refined products to Canada. In less than a week, the Canadian economy would grind to a halt. Canada doesn't have any strategic reserves, because Canada is stupid.
2797 2018-06-11 18:00:34 The idea of ‘loving oil’ is so perverse I don’t to where to start with that.
2798 2018-06-11 18:00:31 Thats another lie and you know it. If not ask your evil queen she has been killing women and children for nothing? Africa has everything. Man power, resources etc. And if that is true tell your evil killer queen govt to leave Africa, esp #Ambazonia oil and gas

2800 2018-06-11 18:00:15 40 minute wait on this oil change is just what this Monday needed. Nothing like getting paid to wait on the work van.
2801 2018-06-11 18:00:09 The oil would certainly continue flowing. The business would continue operating. The vast majority of the employees would remain in place.

2808 2018-06-11 17:59:20 1: No we don't know that they're like oil and water. I will confess that, many years ago, before I studied EU law and, more importantly, practiced it, I would have agreed. But today I fear that the EU (a creature of the UK) is more democratic than the UK....
2809 2018-06-11 17:59:18 It's even best practice to exclude investment which are overly correlated with the movement in the commodity prices you are trying to avoid. So not only are you offshore and globally diversified, you are underweight oil and oil-related assets.
2810 2018-06-11 17:59:15 But You said there are none. Yes we have to start somewhere. Truth is we should be refining our oil for our own consumption and selling any excess to US and not shipping it in or out and in. These pipelines and refineries should've been built yesterday.
2811 2018-06-11 17:59:00 Plus the biggest chunk of PH GDP now is service, not manufacturing. You don’t need crude oil to run human capital.
2812 2018-06-11 17:58:55 We will continue to celebrate the passage of the #PIGB because it will introduce reforms that would engender transparency, while at the same time making the oil and gas sector more business-oriented and profit-drive.

Once again, I commend your leadership for making history
2813 2018-06-11 17:58:52 omg and now you get to experience the deliciousness of them, yes queen yessss!! my big fear food is olive oil for some random reason, but I've been making myself enjoy it the last little while and boy is it amazing!!
2814 2018-06-11 17:58:12 Things that inexplicably annoy me and definitely shouldn't: when people refer to the Oilers as "Oil". Not even a 'the', just... "Oil".
2815 2018-06-11 17:58:08 Rupert (who i got to meet twice) was great for his research on drug trade/Iran-Contra era but wasn't very good on 9/11 & his peak oil shtick, although now I agree with his original premise, that focusing on the WTC graphic evidence would get us no where & he's been right so far

2818 2018-06-11 17:58:05 I love Canada because of the people themselves, the soil is just dirt, the mountains are rock, the oil is decomposed organic materials.

2820 2018-06-11 17:57:56 It's what it is. Our fiscal revenue is positively correlated with a commodity whose price and even production we do not control (oil). It makes a lot of sense to move it into a globally diversified portfolio of investments, ring-fenced from all the risk in the fiscus.
2821 2018-06-11 17:57:51 Oil Change went fast. Good to get that done. Went to Advanced Auto to get check engine light checked... they told me to go to Auto Zone when they couldn’t figure it out. Auto Zone got the code and did a print out for me. Code was P0606. Then they light disappeared. 
2822 2018-06-11 17:57:45 Why would they want American products anyway?

America - a nation that sanctions them, threatens them endlessly, forces them to use the dollar to sell oil & a nation that fights israel's battles for it!

I suspect there are many more brands happy to help & expose the prejudice!
2823 2018-06-11 17:57:42 I broke up with my previous mechanic last week. Dropped my car off at 8am, returned at 6pm and it was still in the same place I parked it. They lied about changing my oil. 
2824 2018-06-11 17:57:40 Not to mention keeping all those maritime trade routes and oil choke points secure.
2825 2018-06-11 17:57:35 Graham is a sad excuse for what he used to be. He's one that is heavily vested in Russian Oil. So disappointed in him.

2831 2018-06-11 17:55:57 Hey bud, thats what freedom is all about. Just like you're free to pretend the oil sands are environmentally friendly, and responsibly exploited.
2832 2018-06-11 17:55:52 It’s nice having memories like this passed on. I just used some coconut oil to clean it up, other than that, it’s still in really good shape.
2833 2018-06-11 17:55:49 One of my favorite go-tos is roasting any kind of squash. Acorn squash, spaghetti squash, etc. Always tasty. Also pan-roasted brussel sprouts.

Also fun: change up how you prep the broccoli. Toss it in some olive oil, throw some minced garlic, salt, pepper, roast it, boom.
2834 2018-06-11 17:55:39 Canada should have been getting much more trade-diversified a long time ago. Trans-Mountain will ensure that happens getting our oil to ports allowing for export to others than the US.
2835 2018-06-11 17:55:32 you do know the plastic used to make plastic water bottles is a BYPRODUCT of the process by which gasoline is refined from crude oil, right?

US companies have been digging for oil for few years (in violation of international law). What the hell is this stupid editor talking about??? Are we that naïve to believe him bhh
2863 2018-06-11 17:53:37 Why doesn't anyone say what's at the heart of Trump's behavior???  Nearly every member of Congress is heavily invested in Russian oil, so they're silently accumulating wealth via Putin. And Trudeau is a harsh reminder to Trump that he's just a fat old man.

2865 2018-06-11 17:53:10 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
2866 2018-06-11 17:53:06 Then explain why NH, ME, & VT which have the laxest laws, including constitutional carry, consistently have the nation's lowest crime & homicide rates. They rarely crack a 1.0 rate when it comes to gun murders.

2868 2018-06-11 17:52:53 Çay'da işlemek için fuel oil kullanılıyor.. Asgari ücret artışı, fahiş mazot zammı sonucu nakliye artışı, hayat pahalılığı vs. Kamyonların zorunlu 3. Köprüye yönlendirilmesi sonucu ilave nakliyedeki artış.

2876 2018-06-11 17:52:10 In primary energy, oil is #1 in Germany and coal #2.
In China, coal is #1 (although we do concede they are serious about nuclear).
France is the exception: nuclear is #1 for them, oil is #2.

2878 2018-06-11 17:52:06 Very disappointed in @AudiOfficial for not doing the right thing.  They had a class action lawsuit for the same oil consumption issue but will do nothing to resolve it except to stall the issue over years then now ask for $5600+ to fix it... or tell us to just buy a new #Audi

2880 2018-06-11 17:52:05 Getting the work truck an oil change and the workers are ordering pizza and my truck won’t be done for an hour and a half. I’m entitled to get a piece of this pie, right?
2881 2018-06-11 17:51:52 LOL between Julien's bullshit description of his ideal water slide & Jenna saying "Absolutely not" this feels like a game of Snake Oil right now.
2882 2018-06-11 17:51:51 You are right. This is what pains me the most. When Nigeria have all the needed advantages, both geographic & resources (both human/material) yet, Morocco, in our very eyes, is growing faster than us while our leaders still think oil is the answer. Cant wait to lead this country.

2884 2018-06-11 17:51:27 This man has no business being in charge of environmental protection. He’s an old school, big oil man from OK. A member of the “Good Ole Boy” network that destroys anything he can get his hands on; for his profit. He left his state position after pulling these same stunts. 
2885 2018-06-11 17:51:26 Munna elaam oru naal than oil vaikama irupanga, Ipa elaam one day than Oil Yeh vaikuranga.. 
2886 2018-06-11 17:51:16 is oil and gas really safe, in fact it is not safe at all for anyone. It destroys our lungs, kills animals, destroys their habitats, pollutes our atmosphere and so much more, the list goes on.....................................................................!?!?!?
2887 2018-06-11 17:51:12 i can remember when the farmers started growing Rapeseed in every other field( or so it seemed) thinking - this will force oil prices down at the pumps
2888 2018-06-11 17:51:10 82.

2889 2018-06-11 17:51:10 Not only that but the livelihoods of many people living on the coast will be ruined by an oil spill which they dont even know how to clean up. It is insanity, just because big Oil wants to squeeze every last penny out of he ground.
2890 2018-06-11 17:51:07 Where tf do you live, dead center in the middle of an oil field?
2891 2018-06-11 17:50:47 @NickHurdUK give #billycaldwell his cannabis oil back. Why make a kid suffer? Surely a compromise can be reached.

2941 2018-06-11 17:44:42 FWIW, "oligarch" isn't about oil. 
"Oligarchy (from Greek ὀλιγαρχία (oligarkhía); from ὀλίγος (olígos), meaning 'few', and ἄρχω (arkho), meaning 'to rule or to command') is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people."

Also sticks it to those who see need for climate change mitigation...an added advantage in Trump world.

2995 2018-06-11 17:40:06 Thanks for sharing  Your peanut oil is SO DELICIOUS in marinades and summer salad dressings...and for bread dipping! #obsessed
2996 2018-06-11 17:40:02 That sounds like some parts of the uk "violent conflict and extreme poverty" wasnt it the united kingdom that started all this in our quest for land, slaves and oil. Then a couple of hundred years later we slap laws on who can go where. Such a beautifully arrogant race we are
2997 2018-06-11 17:39:59 JUST BECAUSE I USE A NICE PEACHY BODY OIL SPRAY,, THIS IS BULLYING,,,?
2998 2018-06-11 17:39:56 @jeremycorbyn  is our  only hope to stop ISIS, he is ANTI-WAR.  IDC about the wing or the government, i want the bombing to stop for oil.. he can't say the things i do because of his position but he knows like i do that these people are actually terrorists creating terrorists..
2999 2018-06-11 17:39:56 Have you noticed how governments are allowing the price of oil to rise to please their globalist masters and protect their bungs. No problem though, you can afford it.

3001 2018-06-11 17:39:50 The scientific evidence in support of a whole food plant-based, no oil, >97% vegan diet being optimal for human health is conclusive.

We have been eating ourselves to death.  Along with much of the biosphere.  

Conscientious ppl are opting out.

3004 2018-06-11 17:39:18 Thank you  It's a little bit of trial and error, not too much mint, not too much lemon zest and definitely not too much olive oil as they can all over-power that lovely flavour of the beans. They are also delicious in a risotto with peas, parsley and kale.

3008 2018-06-11 17:38:11 So, just to clarify, nobody cares about the 1.5 million+ Muslims killed for oil which led to ISIS? If you hate ISIS, why don't you hate the people who created them? Blair, Cameron, May,  coalition was the biggest fuck ever as well loads killed 4 oil please can we work together???
3009 2018-06-11 17:38:10 If it’s not oil related trump is against. It

Who would let me give you a post to share and tag me in for my CBD OIL BUSINESS? With a couple of pictures???
3015 2018-06-11 17:37:40 No i think the need for you to understand what cbd oil is would be better. No strength of cbd oil is illegal. This boy does not need cbd oil he needs more than a single compound from the plant. It is thc heavy. Google my friend

3017 2018-06-11 17:37:35 They literally would just ( as far as I know) like cancel music- where it was illegal to play music because of the sad situation in Palestine- a day of silence instead of sending oil money

3024 2018-06-11 17:37:00 PAUL RYAN is used to being paid BIG BUCKS to pass anything. Just ask him what the going rate is but lots of Cable Lobbyists shoving money at him.

It's bloody simple! Thanks s way up means this way up!!!

3032 2018-06-11 17:35:40 There is no scientific evidence that supports equine therapy has any long term or even short term benefits for PTSD. Shouldn't we spend $5 million on actual therapy for our Vets and not snake oil that lines your pockets? This is disrespectful to the men and women that served.
3033 2018-06-11 17:35:33 a) keep Alberta oil people happy;
b) assert federal power over BC's resistance;
c) use income from the existing pipeline while it lasts (regardless of the cleanup costs for inevitable spills) and hope to sell it off before the costs exceed the revenues.
3034 2018-06-11 17:35:33 Trump's Iran move helped Russian oil that was struggling, he is bitterly dividing the country, destroying alliances and diminishing world standing. Everything Putin would want. He's a Russian asset with full support of GOP/NRA @FoxNews
3035 2018-06-11 17:35:31 Straw purchase is already a crime if a person buys for someone who is a prohibited person.... So we need another law to say it's a crime.

That's typical #gunsense
3036 2018-06-11 17:35:31 No it's not weird...it's whatever works for you. Sometimes I have to just cry out. Deep breathing and peppermint oil on the back of your earlobes...your can get the body spritz and spray yourself down too. I've even clicked my nails to bring me back to reality...hope it helps

3039 2018-06-11 17:35:17 Went and got a massage this morning and just got Sally a much needed oil change and a bath and she’s lookin spicyyyy. Treat yoself and take care of your thangz
3040 2018-06-11 17:35:15 Hehe, can't wait to see how this oil drama goes about. Villagers want actual cash,  we are about to go the 9ja way.
3041 2018-06-11 17:35:11 As the Eid comes nearby, I do remember the ones who comb right through the center of their hairs with heavy oil on, joggers underneath their shalwar kamiz, with visible powder on their neck, ....inko specially kut k Jhapi paayo. My people are lovely 
3042 2018-06-11 17:35:04 Oh and you know the impact of VAT on Oil products right?

Mimi sijui aki tunaelekea wapi....
3043 2018-06-11 17:35:03 Shelving the #KinderMorgan pipeline would be a good place to start don’t you think? You also might be able to patch up your shaky relationship with indigenous leaders in Canada who do not want a massive oil pipeline going through their territories. #StopKM
3044 2018-06-11 17:35:01 @ least milk & dairy are on most labels coconut & palm have over 25 names for them. More and more products substitute coconut or palm oil in things w/ no notice.
3045 2018-06-11 17:35:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
3046 2018-06-11 17:35:00 Stop All Canadian oil at the border opec has always been a better supply remember the gas embargo ? Opec loves trump 
3047 2018-06-11 17:34:57 No it is actually oil, and I didn’t get it at H and B. 
The THC content I was offered was 2, 4 , up to 10.

3049 2018-06-11 17:34:40 yeah I'm not putting olive oil and sugar on my face I'm not some kind of pastry
3050 2018-06-11 17:34:40 Klefbom leaving the oil is likely, but only if Chia continues his poor trade patterns.
3051 2018-06-11 17:34:38 When a car company advertises 'Home of the 30 minute oil change', what they actually mean is 30 minutes once it goes into the service bay. The wait beforehand is totally variable. You could end up waiting 1hr or more total time. Very misleading and dishonest.
3052 2018-06-11 17:34:36 Cuz oil money is what gets stadiums built in the toughest real estate market in the country
3053 2018-06-11 17:34:35 I’m going to cry if I run out of Haitian castor oil before I make a trip to Nassau
3054 2018-06-11 17:34:33 Ok, it's really, really easy to make beard oil, just sayin'. My secret recipe: 90% sweet almond oil, 10% EVOO, add essential oils as desired for the smells (I like cedar and vetiver, your tastes may vary).
3055 2018-06-11 17:34:29 Why are gas prices increasing when we are fracking? Maybe the big oil companies don't have a bigger piece of the pie is my guess. Green Fracking? 5 Technologies for Cleaner Shale Energy

3058 2018-06-11 17:34:23 Jojoba oil is the shits
3059 2018-06-11 17:33:47 Yes, I can see after reading their vision 2030 plans, Morocco planned to generate 52% of thier electricity via renewable sources. Currently is about 23% and moving up. It is something we have to do locally too, yet our care is only oil, gas and nothing else.
3060 2018-06-11 17:33:47 Meanwhile the US and Trump are drilling offshore, dumping fracking and coal effluents into our water and oceans, and subsidizing coal and oil.
3061 2018-06-11 17:33:41 Holy shit I forgot how great oil feels
3062 2018-06-11 17:33:38 There is price fixing in gas too. Frustrating to see a barrel of oil drop by 60% and have family and friends lose everything because of the oil slump yet price at the pump goes up by 30%. But I'm certainly not blaming coil workers for that price increase
3063 2018-06-11 17:33:27 this boy went from 100 seizures a day to no seizures for 250 days because of cannabis oil and they won't give it back? Good Lord ppl need to get over their drug stigmas. Especially one that has many healing properties.

3066 2018-06-11 17:33:07 Today’s move in #Oil  makes me think we will see a new low. I am still waiting for 63.~ Then, let’s ride the bullish macrotrend.
3067 2018-06-11 17:33:03 When Nigeria start valuing its people above oil. And invest into the right and most daring needs of the people... Education, health, infrastructure and respect for human lives.. Only then will we start becoming rich.

3071 2018-06-11 17:32:27 Next time add a quarter cup of yogurt and a teaspoon of oil if it’s fat free yogurt. Although...yuck. Who does fat free yoghurt.
3072 2018-06-11 17:32:27 Hahahaha
Oil use kia?
3073 2018-06-11 17:32:21 Worse case scenario is it is a planned destruction of Canadian Finance! We have oil “Water”! 20% of the worlds fresh water supply!
3074 2018-06-11 17:32:07 Part of the problem is that alt energy development is basically owned by the fossil fuel conglomerates- so they get to determine when/if we get off the oil tit unless regs are passed to ensure we are weaned off quickly. But of course, that’d require the Dems giving up big oil 
3075 2018-06-11 17:32:05 You do realize he was VP when he said that, right?

3077 2018-06-11 17:31:49 Trump is a Russian operative but to dumb to realize it. The next war will be over the arctic sea. Lots of oil and rich minerals. Global warming and no sea ice opens the shipping lanes to Russia. It is all about money. @RonWyden . Why else would Trump act like that to Canada.
3078 2018-06-11 17:31:47 Going to get an oil change gives me awful anxiety. I need someone to handle this part of adulting for me.

3082 2018-06-11 17:31:34 To stick up for the vegetarians, I love to grill black beans with olive oil, herbs, and garlic in a foil packet. You just place it right on the grill and heat until warm. It turns out wonderfully! -AO #AskDad #happyfathersday #fathersdaygift
3083 2018-06-11 17:31:22 I make my beard oil, so it's pretty easy to make it in travel size batches.
3084 2018-06-11 17:31:20 Believe me, I am 100% against the "rule by oil business" model. I think many in the Liberal Party (I'm not) agree that climate change commitments mean reining in a highly polluting resource sector, but the others invest in it or get donations from those who do, and some want to/1
3085 2018-06-11 17:31:15 Try baby oil if you're still suffering
3086 2018-06-11 17:31:10 Do you know that Germany is Russian's #2 trading partner, & that Germany gets their oil from Russia...… and that Merkel speaks Russian.

Then got the wife to put garlic oil aal owa it. Bloke needs to serve a 5 stretch in HMP. 
3089 2018-06-11 17:30:59 So sorry to hear that! The dry oil is still the same organic, unrefined formula you love, but we'd love to help figure this out + get these bottles replaced ASAP. Email us! Love@glowrecipe.com

3094 2018-06-11 17:30:27 Ja det heiter verkeleg det Listhaug møtte mennen sin der, partiet for folk flest ser på seg sjølv som elite.  Her er det verkeleg snakk om "Snake oil"
3095 2018-06-11 17:30:21 I'm still pretty new to this adulthood thing but crying is like a form of maintenance: spiritual, emotional, physical. Like an oil change.
3096 2018-06-11 17:30:21 And it will continue to be said.  All that oil money and can't get a stadium built.
3097 2018-06-11 17:30:03 By twisted you mean interpreted as delivered? I don’t live in NY but I think I can formulate articulate thoughts, even if they differ from yours. Maybe your media-stoked condescension is going to get Trump re-elected so yeah, thanks.

3106 2018-06-11 17:28:37 Love for my fellow humans today. After a routine oil change, one of the techs at the shop went one step beyond to help me with my lawn mower. It'll be sharpened & ship-shape by tomorrow. Thank you for reminding me good people exist Pat!

3110 2018-06-11 17:28:18 That's Too much oil 
3111 2018-06-11 17:28:14 We can't dip into our reserve beyond $25b considering our import bill. Its like having just N8k in your bank account and your minimum balance is N5k as stipulated by your bank and we had just $28b couple with the fact that we were not making much from oil at its lowest ebb.
3112 2018-06-11 17:28:14 You mean like laws?
3113 2018-06-11 17:28:02 Tissue oil is not oil made from tissue but oil for tissue… tissue tissue tissue tissue
3114 2018-06-11 17:27:48 I've seen the effects of cannabis oil on people with epilepsy its amazing...used correctly cannabis oil is a medical miracle.
3115 2018-06-11 17:27:44 my new favorite essential oil is vetiver it’s earthy like patchouli but also kind of lemony? obsessed w it rn
3116 2018-06-11 17:27:41 America is not responsible for her health care. If she thought Obamacare was going to solve her health care problems, we could have told her years ago, it wouldn’t. In fact, we tried.
3117 2018-06-11 17:27:30 You know I live by coconut oil, I’m out there SHINING 
3118 2018-06-11 17:27:25 Your campaign was based on destroying oil, gas, lumber now you relise that the 500 k jobs you destroyed 500 k family's and then you said you created 1.5 m jobs but what you did not say that these jobs had no benefits all of the jobs were part time, no overtime, what you forgot
3119 2018-06-11 17:27:24 Hot oil treatment today and a face mask? I think so.
3120 2018-06-11 17:27:23 If Jacob says there's no need to worry then Jacob can stake his reputation on it.

3125 2018-06-11 17:26:55 Of that $100 you have to take  out the price increase in oil and the price increase in a lot of products as a result of the increase in oil prices.
3126 2018-06-11 17:26:49 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
3127 2018-06-11 17:26:42 Would the Oil want louis Ericksson?
3128 2018-06-11 17:26:23 You are not giving the full truth. Put a graph of the world market price of oil on your graph. You will see a direct correlation ship with your graph.

3132 2018-06-11 17:25:41 Trump is een incompetente manbaby, die faillissement op faillissement stapelde, een bodemloze adoratie nodig heeft voor zijn armtierig persoontje. Niks leiderschap, niks sterke man, niks stabiel genie. Snake oil salesman. Een oplichter, wel de beste van de wereld.
3133 2018-06-11 17:25:35 For ever if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
3134 2018-06-11 17:25:28 Was good to be home again but time to head out and make that oil field money
3135 2018-06-11 17:25:21 In 2015, Pemex announces a large find of oil reserves across 4 fields in the southern Gulf of Mexico, representing approximately 350 million barrels.
3136 2018-06-11 17:25:18 Your point was clear and left no room to be misinterpreted. If you’re going to be an elitist snob then at least be prideful of your elitism and snobbery rather than hide it and attempt to portray yourself as something you’re not.
3137 2018-06-11 17:25:11 Actually, he thought he was in charge of drilling for oil, when he first heard of the portfolio...
3138 2018-06-11 17:25:00 You assume that remains static.  All you need is a small move to plug-ins or recapture, or all electric to make a huge difference.  10 years ago people said we were at peak oil, probably someone like you.  Oops.
3139 2018-06-11 17:24:53 I spend the entire day blotting my oily T zone & then in the night I go to sleep slathered in bio oil  

Why am I like this?
3140 2018-06-11 17:24:50 Ooh that happened to my daughter and we had to float it out with olive oil.
3141 2018-06-11 17:24:45 Bhai aisa hai jitna oil tum log apni iftaar ki dishes me use karte ho na...

Use america oil ke naye well ki khoj bata kar apna dawa thok de.
3142 2018-06-11 17:24:24 LET US ALL REMEMBER THIS DAY ,WHEN REFUGEES WERE LEFT TO DROWN BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T WHITE SKINNED. SHAME ON YOU BARBARIC BASTARDS ,REMOVE YOURSELVES FROM THEIR LANDS IF YOU CAN'T EXCEPT THEM FLEEING YOUR OIL WARS

3146 2018-06-11 17:24:08 Hi Jam , I bought a few in the market.   If they execute the  plan then could be a multiple by Jan/Feb. 10 workovers and sidetracks fully funded, 110 bopd breakeven @ $70 oil
3147 2018-06-11 17:24:02 Just sat in the rain for 15 minutes trying to get the oil cap off of my car and couldn’t get it.  so now I’m sitting in the ace parking lot waiting on Tyler with 2 very sore thumbs. #happymonday
3148 2018-06-11 17:23:54 You have to get the plant oil off of your skin.  Requires scrubbing to the bone. There's also a shot, I'm not sure if it's steroid or not.   DON'T SCRATCH.
3149 2018-06-11 17:23:53 Yes I’m down dude, I’m excited for houston. I need to get an oil change asap
3150 2018-06-11 17:23:48 anyone have low price good recs for oil based cleansers? rn i use banila co clean it zero and its so good but its like $15-$20 lol
3151 2018-06-11 17:23:42 @mandy_velez it's people like you that drove me to the country. I like to be smarter than my closest neighbor, course they are cattle.

3153 2018-06-11 17:23:39 Sigh! The Dorwest Herbs G&F are great, used them for several of my dogs for years. Also worth checking Proflax skin oil
3154 2018-06-11 17:23:31 I never did either but i wasn’t sure if you were supposed to cause oil changes for new cars are expensive as it is 
3155 2018-06-11 17:23:29 They call my oil I’ll tell you why it’s cus I’m crood and unrefined
3156 2018-06-11 17:23:19 Keystone supplies President Trump with cheap Canadian oil for decades. Then, US adds value & sells refined product back (or not, given Trump's trade temperament).  It's time to expand refining here, add jobs in Canada, not Texas. Is there anyway to get EE back on track? #cdnpoli
3157 2018-06-11 17:23:12 Well, with the oil costs going up  I'm more interested on the net profit side...

3159 2018-06-11 17:23:05 I wonder if Dave Wall is up sipping champagne because oil has already surfaced #88e @88EnergyLtd
3160 2018-06-11 17:23:02 UK and many western countries have a history of corruptions, bribery. Go check @NewAgeLtd and partners history. You brought corruption into Africa. In to my country and turn around to accuse me of which that you are guilty off. Well done. Tell your queen govt to leave our oil/gas
3161 2018-06-11 17:22:44 ストレス過多って奴だ！！！
3162 2018-06-11 17:22:41 The citizens in allied nations who are victimized by a foreign invasion caused by unnecessary wars in islamic nations to establish oil & gas pipelines, feel isolated as they get arrested for speaking about crimes against them by a contrived "refugee" invasion & conquest
3163 2018-06-11 17:22:39 Wish we could get this money back. Q Reparations? "Flow of MONEY" screams oil pipeline to me. All the EU leaders needed to do, was hold the line, not lose ground, and they would be swimming in Billions. #Qanon #WeThePeople #TheGreatAwakening Oh, and swampy. Chik-Fil-a is hiring.
3164 2018-06-11 17:22:31 #asktwitter has anyone tried CBD oil/capsules for joint pain & if so how effective/trusted suppliers?
3165 2018-06-11 17:22:25 A nice date would be coming with me to go essential oil shopping. 

I be spending like 2 hours in the store trying to find the perfect scent.

3167 2018-06-11 17:21:30 I need somebody to oil my scalp. 
3168 2018-06-11 17:21:28 I really use coconut oil for almost everything 
3169 2018-06-11 17:21:03 9 days in Rhodes and I’m still pale .. fuck it oil out for the last 2 days 
3170 2018-06-11 17:21:00 Our store cupboards are bare, and as we get ready for our June Free Shop, we could really do with the following: UHT milk, Basmati rice, pasta, sunflower oil, tuna, shaving foam, razors, deodorants, shampoo and body lotion. Please get in touch if you can help!
3171 2018-06-11 17:20:56 Lmaoo. Not like I have oil anyway 
3172 2018-06-11 17:20:56 And a little goes a long way with that damn oil lol.
3173 2018-06-11 17:20:48 Wish it’d be so simple... of course that everybody wants a democracy as we had before 1999. The oil industry was state-owned then of course. And technically managed. But right now the priority is the recovering of a minimum democratic institutional frame
3174 2018-06-11 17:20:22 nalagyan ng oil mata ko :(
3175 2018-06-11 17:20:17 Really amazing considering that Philippines is the natural point of trade between the US+Mexico and Asia at large. Trade winds make it ez- we're just not smart enough to employ the tradewinds yet for shipping. Crude oil was cheap+considered non-invasive before but is now neither.
3176 2018-06-11 17:20:13 What kind of tissue is used to make tissue oil?
3177 2018-06-11 17:20:13 Yes, Scotland gains about 10% of its Gas, Oil, fishing, forestry, water and Whisky Etc. Revenues all goes to Westminster, they get 90% we get the 10% back under the block grant 
Apparently we’re in a union of equals 
3178 2018-06-11 17:20:06 @Wendys my location is never clean. The lemonade is never running (the machine) and there was what looked to be a crap ton of pulp sitting on top or huge chunk of ice in the lemonade. my fries tasted like bad oil. But the burger was great. Love you guys
3179 2018-06-11 17:20:03 @CoriumSkincare Pomegranate oil
3180 2018-06-11 17:19:57 Caitlin chuckled and looked over her shoulder. 

“You are Welcome to rub some tanning oil on you to get some sun as well. I think it be fun for you to relax and let loose for once mister hero.” 

She teased him turning back to allow him some comfort. She can tell he was nervous-
3181 2018-06-11 17:19:54 @Whitney_Wonders celebrating with pizza. Replaced both headlights and added oil. No injuries. 
3182 2018-06-11 17:19:48 gonna marry a rich oil baron and become a trophy wife so I can get a switch and octopath traveller
3183 2018-06-11 17:19:45 The oxygen around me has tooo much carbohydrate, protein , fats and oil,....and even water!!
3184 2018-06-11 17:19:43 Nothing to do with bus services.Its the cost of the buses especially in UK. But as usual in Aberdeen they think everyone works in the oil industry and are punished for it taxi are just as bad but that is regulated by the councils
3185 2018-06-11 17:19:31 She's bringing in an oil containing THCA, which will not get you stoned but at hight heat will become THC, hence the ban. I don't agree with the decision, but I fear the government are shitting it over setting a legal precedent and their friends in big pharma loosing on profits
3186 2018-06-11 17:19:31 Oil has no lease market, so the backwardation example using oil to explain gold and silver backwardation is not spot on, because oil has no interest rate, whereas gold  and silver do, it is called the 'lease rate'.  What if LIBOR, EURIBOR or FED funds is lower than PM lease rate?
3187 2018-06-11 17:19:27 “Dirtiest oil on the planet” ugh  people are so uninformed. If they’re going to fight against their own country they should at least know what they’re talking about.
3188 2018-06-11 17:19:27 Very consistent with the reason trump loves Putin so much. Wants to keep the oil and gas market at top bc of bribes of oil $. See dossier!
3189 2018-06-11 17:19:21 Once we are done with ‘Data is the new oil’, people will realise in the future ‘Water is the new oil’.
3190 2018-06-11 17:19:17 OiLちゃんお疲れさまー！！！！
3191 2018-06-11 17:19:12 I buy Chinese pump parts for my oil rig customers in lieu of US made.  (cause they are 1/3 the price).  When Trump started talking steel tariffs the price went up 25%.  I raised my prices accordingly and my customers understand a pay.  Because it's still a good exchange of value
3192 2018-06-11 17:19:02 i need my cuticles cut, nails done, booty rubbed, hair slayed, summer clothes, endless slides, a puppy, a oil change.. fix it jesus
3193 2018-06-11 17:19:02 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3194 2018-06-11 17:18:59 The government are going to have to accept that cannabis oil will be legalised one day... the big pharma companies are ripping people off
3195 2018-06-11 17:18:54 > “...driven largely by the rising price of oil”

How do these “experts” get a free pass non-stop for saying this sh*t? Gas wasn’t even this expensive when the price of oil was DOUBLE what it is now. 

This story should have Trudeau’s name in it paragraph after paragraph.
3196 2018-06-11 17:18:42 Other than needing a new bridge & a setup it’s in good nick. Frets could do with a clean & a bit of lemon oil on the fret board. I’d need to get a new bridge and a set of strings on it to get an idea of any real bowing cos it’s straight without strings at the mo.
3197 2018-06-11 17:18:29 Ugh Fish Oil burps are the wooooooorst. I just want shiny hair, dammit!

3201 2018-06-11 17:18:17 Supreme Court suspended taxes on Mobile cards. But, on the other hand, there has been a drastic rise in prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene oil.
Petrol has jumped up from 91rs/l to 96rs/l.

3202 2018-06-11 17:18:15 Thanks... I've tried all of these... even bathe his eyes with green tea... smear coconut oil on his itchy paws, which he licks straight off, obvs... he gets omega 3... special multi vits with pre-probiotics.. saurkraut, etc... you name it... been going on for years & years. 
3203 2018-06-11 17:18:14 What is wrong with this country. A woman has come back to the UK with cannabis oil for her son who has severe epilepsy an the oil helps with his seizures. She's immediately had it taken off her at customs!
Yeh let him suffer than shall we!! 

Seriously WTAF.

3205 2018-06-11 17:18:03 Im 100% pro trade advocate and believe completely on free trade and building bridges. But im pained by us loosing all our comparative advantages to countries that cant stand us on anything, simply because we refuse to give up on the thinking around oil as the main savior.
3206 2018-06-11 17:18:02 We give you oil and electricity cheaper than we pay here in Canada.  It balances  out. Please please educate yourself.  Just see if what I'm saying is true. It fine I'm not offended as you are being lied to. A real shame. When has Canada ever said No.
3207 2018-06-11 17:17:57 เป็นงานตัดต่อแนว surreal fantasy อะค่ะ แล้วก็ใช้ oil painting effect ให้ดูคล้ายภาพสีน้ำมันค่ะ
3208 2018-06-11 17:17:44 Anointed myself with blessed oil on my way to the first day of my summer job so I’m prepared for whatever kind of day today will be. Even put a Lil on my lips so I can be sure to watch my mouth! #ThankYouJesus
3209 2018-06-11 17:17:39 I’ve been putting oil on my hair almost everyday. Dis prolly not such a good idea
3210 2018-06-11 17:17:30 Also I’m gonna plug for nuclear power here because it provides the greatest amount of energy for the smallest environmental impact of any form of generation and it can end both energy poverty and oil dictatorships.

Split, don’t emit.
3211 2018-06-11 17:17:27 Matte lipsticks always do swatches under running water but lshow me matte lipsticks that don’t come off with oil, so that I can eat and peace and then we can talk
3212 2018-06-11 17:17:24 Russia is weak but Putin's claim to legitimacy is that he's Making Russia Great Again. If the US and West are united and the int'l order is stable, Russia appears weak. But if the West is divided and chaos reins Russia seems powerful. That's worth more to him than oil prices.
3213 2018-06-11 17:17:14 I had a dream last night - the air was heavily scented with lavender and there was a rose quartz orb reflecting the moonlight. I know what I plan on doing today: oil pulling! Namaste.
3214 2018-06-11 17:17:06 Scott Pruitt used taxpayer money to try and extort this same fast food group into providing Pruitt's family with a lifetime sinecure.

But your 1st tweet about them is getting mad at private citizens who don't like their politics.

So, they're a donor & you like oil money too.
3215 2018-06-11 17:17:05 Honestly I liked the idea of the electrically fired rifle.  The lock time was almost instantaneous.  You could still use regular ammo as well.  However like I said, would I trust me life to it, nope.

3217 2018-06-11 17:16:47 Tell your queen to backoff our oil and gas and all other illigal funding to the Biya govt. And see She is guilty since 1961 but she just expose the face behind the marks recently via @NewAgeLtd
3218 2018-06-11 17:16:34 #Oil companies like @Chevron, @Shell, @exxonmobil, @Saudi_Aramco aramco, @KuwaitPetroleum etc. Will have to transform as energy brands.
3219 2018-06-11 17:16:33 @VauxhallEngland I can't find what oil I need for Vauxhall mokka x petrol. Which one is it. Or selection of good ones please.

3227 2018-06-11 17:15:01 They were good guys once until they started having ideas of their own. 

In comparison they were no worse than Sultan of Brunei or the Saudi king on human rights. But those guys are the darlings of the US until the oil runs out or they do something stupid like dropping the dollar
3228 2018-06-11 17:14:56 yeah I got you!!! My wife had a stroke a few months ago and I'm trying to talk her into trying CBD oil for her arteries. They say it's good for all that!!!!
3229 2018-06-11 17:14:49 Do women don't take their cars for oil change ever? Men tend to give you the ugly look when you know more about cars "than what you are supposed to know" 
3230 2018-06-11 17:14:48 If I’m tweeting a lot it’s because I been waiting a whole ass hour on my oil change.
3231 2018-06-11 17:14:38 @ERTACobblerLine Reality is that the road-car-oil-lorry-quarry platform upon which our transport, logistics and distribution system relies is polluting, land-grabbing and destructive of land, wildlife and ecology/environment, global to local, change starts in our back yards.
3232 2018-06-11 17:14:28 I believe this.  I have also read that other Republicans were also offered shares in the Russian oil company.
3233 2018-06-11 17:14:27 Right lmao keep da fruit , send the oil
3234 2018-06-11 17:14:12 Wait, it's an insult to tell someone that there are more inexpensive places to live?
3235 2018-06-11 17:14:09 That's my side. It got my oil.

3245 2018-06-11 17:12:33 Overheard in the coffee shop just now "How can Trudeau implement a carbon tax supposed to make us drive less & save the environment & with the next breath spend $4 billion to buy a pipeline to transport some of the dirtiest oil on the planet?" -This remains a problem for JT in BC
3246 2018-06-11 17:12:22 Time for free trade across all provinces. Expect oil and gas workers in Western Canada to expect or receive same treatment

Serious research is required.

3277 2018-06-11 17:09:31 @LukeGromen in “Century of War” it is proposed that 70’s oil shocks and Volker rate shock were intentional to submarine EM economies and keep dollar in control.  Could a similar strategy be in play here?

3412 2018-06-11 16:57:31 Scotland is at the mercy of WM policies. Brexit is on the horizon. The real question you should be asking is why were we told to vote No to protect our economy, that we needed the broad shoulders of the UK. Why is an oil rich country not prospering ?

3415 2018-06-11 16:57:09 Okay, so heavily diluted tee tree oil seems to be working as a great alternative to the antibiotic drops thus far. I've only had to apply it twice so far, its also helping with the pain in combination with the Norco and also with the swelling around the ear.
3416 2018-06-11 16:57:01 with all the stuff Trump has done lately, the people from his base are blowing loads in there pants and a bunch of new people are starting to put there hands down their pants...very dangerous...its getting crazy out there people..expect a USA oil deal with Venezuela soon...
3417 2018-06-11 16:56:55 Not true. Since no one wants to visit wherever you are in MidWest, you know nothing of tourism industry.

Tourism is the #1 employer in New Orleans (port #2, food processing #3, oil & gas #4) and Trump is HURTING US !!

Since you do not care about us, why should we care @ you ?

3419 2018-06-11 16:56:38 Solar and wind energy are now cost competitive with fossil fuel generated power and will continue to get cheaper. "Traditional" in the context of this article means oil and coal fired plants-which are cost prohibitive because of cheap fracked gas.
3420 2018-06-11 16:56:38 That’s great you want to protect Ontario jobs don’t forget Quebec jobs that’s the only concern you and Trudeau have however ppl in the oil patch got the finger from Wynne and Trudeau so don’t expect any sympathy from the west go Trump

3472 2018-06-11 16:51:05 An Australian news station claimed to have evidence of Carter Page bringing a pay-for-play offer to Trump involving a Russian oil company. Now that it's been deleted makes me wonder about authenticity.

3547 2018-06-11 16:43:39 Sir if I may say it also got HPCL in return for that cash that hedges its risk from falling crude oil prices to an large extent and an already set up retail outlets
3548 2018-06-11 16:43:39 5castor oil is amazing at helping your eyelashes and eyebrows grow.
6make sure your getting enough sleep at night, it makes all the difference.
3549 2018-06-11 16:43:32 The reach is far and wide but the limitations are many and frustrating. Used well, and precisely, there's much good can be done. Good for sketches not for oil paintings. I learn a lot from reading people like you. I dip in and dip out. Short and punchy and some of it sticks...

3555 2018-06-11 16:42:54 You are giving me lots of ideas @MrsCford_tweets - Snake Oil to have Ss practice argument writing or speaking. Can be like battle of the books #USMSpark
3556 2018-06-11 16:42:47 7 council members who still continue to discredit anything to do with env as loud trouble makers. Issues ranging from lack of waste management, oil spill to problematic road designs with narrow pavements. Very concerning.
3557 2018-06-11 16:42:46 Too right the anti oil is mostly the US based Oil interests using green groups to stop pipelines.  

Regardless I put all the blame on pimped out Canadians, like David Suzuki for selling out.
3558 2018-06-11 16:42:44 Some people are allergic or sensitive to certain oils/scents so its too much of a risk. Sometimes i just put lavender oil above my lip to breathe in but sometimes it gives me a headache 
3559 2018-06-11 16:42:40 But if already doing MCT oil, probably don’t “need” extra coconut oil.

3564 2018-06-11 16:42:01 Oh Andrea, what do you even know about this? Seriously? You do know the US has a trade surplus, right? And that the US subsidizes big oil and farmers in your country. So until you know what you're talking about, you might want to stop accusing us of something we are NOT doing.
3565 2018-06-11 16:42:00 Coconut oil always best for Alz. This was a ridiculous OVERfeeding study.

3570 2018-06-11 16:41:45 i cant say about other europeans, but most of us finns see that we need a Strong Europe (my vision is unified Europe) rather than USA meddling in Finland and Pulling its soldiers to fight for their war for oil.

3575 2018-06-11 16:41:11 And yet, a $15 magnet can bypass that $2K smart gun technology.

Odd that the police & military don't want it... Until they have been using it for yrs and proven it's reliable, I will consider it. Until then, the answer is no.

3589 2018-06-11 16:39:41 Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple.. it's very crowded these days. I like all old temples build with rocks and the oil and camper smell makes me feel that I'm in temple, the same feel I didn't get in the modern day architecture temples.

3595 2018-06-11 16:39:06 Now do oil prices !
3596 2018-06-11 16:39:05 Actually that is probably haze from Indonesia burning fields to plant palm oil but if you want to call that excitement WTF
3597 2018-06-11 16:39:01 Germany is Russia's 2nd biggest trading partner...  
Germany buys their oil from Russia. 

Merkel speaks Russian.... #JustSaying
3598 2018-06-11 16:38:46 Here's the give-away: "Creating an open marketplace for autonomous fleets would encourage innovation and evolution....Competition would ensure that the fleets adjust to our tastes." Who is "us" in this snake oil pitch? Translation: turn the city over to Musk and Co.
3599 2018-06-11 16:38:39 Andrew,i really think you should stfup on your personal vendetta against @JustinTrudeau  and attempt to help Canadians solve our trade and oil export problems caused by your previous govt and your great friend in Washington/
3600 2018-06-11 16:38:15 That's for sure! I think he sold Alaska out for a piece of the oil rights...who knows WHAT she'll company would get THAT chunk of 'scarole ().
3601 2018-06-11 16:38:02 Y'all gotta watch some OG Star Trek. Passion and logic may seem like oil and water, but they're actually besties.  Both are valid and smart.
3602 2018-06-11 16:37:59 If you ever have the unfortunate urge to buy shakeweights...save yourself some #money (and embarrassment) and just buy some natural  butter. Shaking the jar to mix the butter and oil does the trick.
3603 2018-06-11 16:37:54 I believe Canada and EU should establish a duty free zone. If Trump decides to cut them off cold Turkey, let them...This would include the pipeline oil as well This would have an impact on midterm elections in favor of the dems.
3604 2018-06-11 16:37:50 So I was putting oil in my car this morning... put my car keys down next to me inside of the hood- long story short I knocked them down INSIDE of my engine :-) so it’s been a fun Monday
3605 2018-06-11 16:37:47 Hi Janet, thanks for your inquiry, the stainless steel plates are best seasoned with cooking oil before your first use, you can use a paper towel with vegetable or canola oil and wipe them down then burn it off.  Thanks- Amanda
3606 2018-06-11 16:37:29 *in a cooking class*
Chef-Coke was used to clean off oil and rust on people’s floors so what does it do to your insides?
Matthew- yeah exactly that’s why I drink Dr Pepper
3607 2018-06-11 16:37:29 I just saw somebody try to make a funny about Camila by saying “do you use olive or canola oil when you cook?” Personally i use vegetable oil but to each their own.
3608 2018-06-11 16:37:24 @petenajarian Hi Pete loved the discussion on the the oil companies but how about BP though great dividend and getting its act together. Your thoughts? cheers Ant

3610 2018-06-11 16:37:11 Is that shows capacity utilisation of consumption of oil based companies comes down?
3611 2018-06-11 16:37:07 Penny wise and pound foolish President wants to pay N. Korea taxpayer financed money, to get 1/5 an Iran Nuclear Agreement, and then start an Iranian War, without understanding Iran can stop the flow of oil, from the ME, and/or lead to a much wider, more deadly, destructive, &
3612 2018-06-11 16:37:05 It makes no sense to have an alliance with Europe just so they can.....buy Russian oil?
3613 2018-06-11 16:36:50 So i guess the indigeneous people fighting canada over broken treaties, oil pipe lines and outright abuse aren't human.

3617 2018-06-11 16:36:05 Peppermint oil is a huge help for headaches. Get some if you don't have it. Cotton swab and rub it on the painful areas. Temporary relief can be huge
3618 2018-06-11 16:36:04 This is what is going on in southern Cameroon  while the rest of the world watch and is business as usual. The UK ,and #France know what is going on ,they pump the dictator with more money to kill armless ppl all because of oil #bloodmoney #freesoutherncameroon #stopthegenocide
3619 2018-06-11 16:35:58 Delaware's not even in the top ten of the biggest drug exporters for the US so I think it's just a matter of their state size and not having like, oil or other minerals that make them more money. Also maybe Switzerland is laundering their Nazi gold?
3620 2018-06-11 16:35:57 Do you think the 10th Gen smart gun would be the technical peer to these beta tests? 

Man on the moon; cured polio; robotic surgery.

If guns could be deactivated, thefts would plummet...no replacement sales. @NRA is facilitating pass-through sale to criminals.

Spend the money on education, healthcare, fighting poverty, massive government debt.

3664 2018-06-11 16:30:53 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
3665 2018-06-11 16:30:48 Will there be tariffs on the tar sands oil coming from TransCanada whose pipelines explode, leak? I would like to see that stopped, BUT then tRumps friends in Russia & Saudi will be able to increase price of oil thereby helping the USA fracking corps who need oil higher than $65
3666 2018-06-11 16:30:30 We actually became a major oil exporter under Obama.
3667 2018-06-11 16:30:25 Thank you for your inquiry, would you mind sending us a DM so we can send you some info about our Palm Oil use.

3671 2018-06-11 16:30:20 Please do not worry about oil since Canadians are very busy these days BLOCKING the construction of ANY new PIPELINE that would take all that OIL to NEW markets, so please don't worry you have this under control no matter what the pussy grabber does to us #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
3672 2018-06-11 16:30:19 And why actual care is absurdly overpriced.

If car insurance paid for oil changes it would be exorbitant too.
3673 2018-06-11 16:30:19 I'm down. did you know that 95% humidity + the smell of fish oil at 150C plus the beeping of a broken fume hood is migraine inducing?
3674 2018-06-11 16:30:09 Haven’t sent a tweet in years! But I must complain about #reddit being down, while I’m sitting here, waiting for my oil to get changed! #wtfreddit

3676 2018-06-11 16:29:42 The reason Norway peppered despite being out of the EU is the combination of a small population and massive oil reserves, neither of which applies to us.

3684 2018-06-11 16:28:35 Almond or cashew milk. Peanut butter or almond butter. Honey or Agave nectar. Coconut oil in the boiling water and then add coconut milk.
3685 2018-06-11 16:28:32 I haven't tried the oils from Corium (yet!) but I know rosehip, almond or tamanu oil are great for pigmentation 
3686 2018-06-11 16:28:26 This one feels so different from your usual stuff! It has an oil painting feel to it, like Chris Rahn's stuff. Awesome as always!
3687 2018-06-11 16:28:24 The 70s recession was caused by the Oil Shock, a result of an OAPEC oil embargo. Other factors included the end of post-war recovery stimulated by massive cash injections from the US and the huge amount of necessary rebuilding. So I don't see what that has to do with the EU
3688 2018-06-11 16:28:20 Good day everyone. Let's hope we have a good week.
3689 2018-06-11 16:28:11 Congratulations
3690 2018-06-11 16:28:10 I don’t agree with Trumps tariffs that said I’d rather have more level trading between Our countries! Starting with Canadian Oil! We have to stop international interference in and subversive control of our oil industry! Oil to Tidewater!
3691 2018-06-11 16:28:06 GOD is a Eurocentric name created for different entities that are worshipped or that hold values and power. This Earth’s GOD in the eyes of western indoctrination is Gold, Oil, and drugs(food included) .
3692 2018-06-11 16:27:57 Y'all have been Hoodwinked and bamboozled by the snake oil salesmen. Donald John Trump.
3693 2018-06-11 16:27:46 He could care less about those Clean jobs.. it is all about coal, and oil..the more they push out clean jobs, the more people will look backwards to dirty fuels.
3694 2018-06-11 16:27:46 Your father Netanyahu is giving you that and he is using no oil around screw.
3695 2018-06-11 16:27:37 That beard oil tho
3696 2018-06-11 16:27:27 Grouopon is clutch for the oil changes.
3697 2018-06-11 16:27:20 あぁ、それは女オタだわ…
3698 2018-06-11 16:27:20 Need to know your secret for such glowing skin! Are you still trying oil pulling?
3699 2018-06-11 16:27:13 With all the progress they made, they will compromise internally. Saudis will get them to understand the economic effect of very high oil and they will propose both a short term and long term solution
3700 2018-06-11 16:27:13 Sitting at the shop waiting for an oil change. Should I read, write, or take a huge risk and drink the coffee sitting by the tv? #writing #reading #coffee #decisionsdecisions
3701 2018-06-11 16:27:09 娘が寝言で「シャア！シャア！」って言ったんだけど、見せてませんよ？
3702 2018-06-11 16:26:58 Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.
Those who have no idea, write about it.
3703 2018-06-11 16:26:51 People will be pleased if democracy is adhered too. We both know that democracy & the EU are like water & oil though, they just don't mix. Range Rover are going to Slovakia, so what? Plenty of other businesses are doing great & unemployment is the lowest it has been for decades.
3704 2018-06-11 16:26:35 I like the idea of getting the Oilers 10th overall pick and taking on lucic to do it could work if Oil retains 2M of his salary. This would be #Habs flexing their financial muscles to get a great pick in a good draft. What would be required the other way I do not know.
3705 2018-06-11 16:26:32 @ukhomeoffice Just heard your statement re: C. Caldwell and the Cannabis oil for her son. I am intrigued to know how you justify your position with the UK being the largest exporter of medicinal Cannabis in the world if it is your ‘duty to stop banned substances entering the UK’
3706 2018-06-11 16:26:21  bhai jio ambani k dhande me chullu bhar b contribute nahi krti...Uski oil refineries kab bani...Kiske sarkar me bani aur kaise alot hui yeh padh lio.
3707 2018-06-11 16:26:19 I cannot see any way in which withholding cannabis oil from this wee guy is in the public interest.
3708 2018-06-11 16:26:14 Currently at the dealership getting my Jeep an oil change and I probably should’ve mentioned the death wobbles I’ve been experiencing in my Jeep lol 
3709 2018-06-11 16:26:10 The tax cuts were wiped out by raising oil prices and it won’t be long before banks are taking advantage of the average citizen with the regulation roll backs. I’m interested to know what he’s done for the average citizen thus far...
3710 2018-06-11 16:26:08 Rahul Gandhi: Safola oil toh de diya bhaiyya. Iske sath ka gift nahi diya? 

Shopkeeper: Iske sath koi gift nahi hai 

Rahul Gandhi: Ullu matt banao isme likha hai “Cholesterol Free”

3711 2018-06-11 16:25:58 What's on my mind is something that EVERYONE should be asking...why are gas prices SIGNIFICANTLY higher than last year, when it is a known fact that the price of a barrel of oil has NEVER BEEN LOWER than it is today...
3712 2018-06-11 16:25:54 Same oil?
3713 2018-06-11 16:25:54 That was the plan of the USA from the beginning! The oil fields of Deir Ez-Zor! From all  4 parties in Syria (FSA, Regime Forces, PKK, ISIS) the PKK alias SDF was the one willing to deliver Deir EzZor to the West!

3714 2018-06-11 16:25:53 Oil man levou um tombo?
3715 2018-06-11 16:25:47 Wrong deal With a wrong country. That gas is owned by southern Cameroon and not french Cameroon.Did you actually verify the the owners of that gas and oil?
The money signed in that deal is being used by french Cameroon to commite genocide.
3716 2018-06-11 16:25:44 Anointing oil to ma bà ayè e jé dànù asheirè Omó..
3717 2018-06-11 16:25:43 Rather like all those huge corporations avoiding tax ....Rather like the massive business we do in Arms sakes ... pandering to despots for oil. Meanwhile people are dying but as long as they are nowt to do with us it’s ok ???? 
3718 2018-06-11 16:25:36 OK vegetable oil face
3719 2018-06-11 16:25:29 Thanks bro, gamit ko kasi castor oil. Kaso di kumakapal strands. Nag gro-grow lang ata.

3720 2018-06-11 16:25:28 tumpang tanya, dlm biore tu kiranya ada mineral oil la ye? sbb i pakai ni dah lebih stgh tahun tp milia seeds tu still ada
3721 2018-06-11 16:25:16 Perhaps not... But our 30% discounted oil from Alberta seems quite popular.
3722 2018-06-11 16:25:03 @MwangiWaIria squabbling MCAs, Monkey Meat and Menace, Ndakaini refusing to board .... Let me sell the 1.5 Million annointing oil to you. Genuine, Made in Israel, works instantly and together we shall conquer the devil. Infact it might be a '22 Door Opener!
3723 2018-06-11 16:25:02 So then why do Oil let him go at the lowest time in his career? Also wasn't Chirelli saying they lost leadership in the dressing room? So now we lose more. Can't react to one bad season. Sends a bad message to players around the league as well.

3729 2018-06-11 16:24:27 this food bout to be so oil after school, i’m hungry asfff
3730 2018-06-11 16:24:26 PSST. Donald. Wanna make Trudeau cry into his poutine? Revoke the permit for TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline! Then Russia & Saudi Arabia won't have to kill tar sands in the crib by keeping oil prices low. Putin will love you for it! Remember that Saudi sword dance? Good times!

3733 2018-06-11 16:24:17 Lazy and I'll conceived? You don't understand what goes into freighting. Who do you think ensures freight over the ocean reaches it's destination? In 100% of all cases it is the US Navy. It is expensive. Noone else will buy your shitty oil sands but us. Good luck without us lol.
3734 2018-06-11 16:24:13 @techneek10  the US actually  runs a surplus in trade with Canada if oil is excluded
3735 2018-06-11 16:24:05 Fold in eight teaspoons of olive oil and set aside.
3736 2018-06-11 16:23:51 a few words of wisdom:

fuckboys aren’t worth your time
eeeeyyyooowwww
3737 2018-06-11 16:23:49 I think I'm okay w/that ... *laughing* ... I wonder if the turtle can swim or if he's a land tortoise? Ryan will just glide along on his oil slick ... the images keep coming ...
3738 2018-06-11 16:23:45 I had filed a compliant related to the rude behavior and corruption by indian oil gas agency. One month ago. When i call customer care they dont know the status.
Area sales manager helped agent to close the complaint without my consent .
3739 2018-06-11 16:23:42 True, maybe we should celebrate winning with some poison Round-up corn or soybeans? Water with a side of fracked oil?

3745 2018-06-11 16:23:22 Is causing a dangerous amount of greenhouse gases to be emitted into the environment. This is literally known as cow farts. Though it seems silly, it’s a proven fact and animal agriculture has been proved the #1 emitir of greenhouse gases: above transportation gases, oil, etc.
3746 2018-06-11 16:23:19 If anyone suffers with migraines try rubbing  peppermint oil on your temples. It's the ONLY thing that has actually worked for me. You're welcome 
3747 2018-06-11 16:23:13 We only use RSPO certified sources of palm oil and only when it’s not possible to replace with other fats. Our Food Team are working to reduce our use of palm oil and we hope this helps to reassure you.

3749 2018-06-11 16:22:49 Shooting the moisturiser like a fucked up oil rig . There’s so many lines from that. Check out more of Chris Morris. Proper genius
3750 2018-06-11 16:22:47 That is what I am doing after work. Oil Change
3751 2018-06-11 16:22:47 Pope Francis is only considered infallible when it comes to Catholic Canon.

And he couldn't be more wrong. 

The poor can't afford solar panels
The poor can't afford hydroelectric
The poor can't afford wind

The poor can afford coal
The poor can afford oil

3754 2018-06-11 16:22:44 Of course, the honey is more for inflammation, brightening and as a thickening agent. But yoghurt and turmeric only is also very effective  if you have dry skin, you can even add a few drops of almond oil.
3755 2018-06-11 16:22:30 Sick and tired of being accused of not knowing the lyrics to #GodBlessAmerica. Here it is:

God bless America
Hail King Donald I
Stand beside her
And guide her
To the cable channel that carries Fox News

Mine the mountains
Frack the prairies 
Drill the oceans
For its oil!...
3756 2018-06-11 16:22:29 Bro we barely can put baby oil on the stairs  we had so much shit planned for senior prank day cuh .
3757 2018-06-11 16:22:23 Oh. That's not good. Who takes tires off to do an oil change? Bizarre.
3758 2018-06-11 16:22:19 Dear Canada,
Cut off the oil, precious metals and gas supply.
Screw the orange clown and his minions.
Enough is enough.
3759 2018-06-11 16:22:15 What you centrist corporatist shills are counting on is all the paint they will have to pay for to cover up the graffiti. We just have to spray paint a milli..wait..how much profit do oil corps make...a trillion more tractors and the the revolution will have begun
3760 2018-06-11 16:22:12 Tea tree oil.
3761 2018-06-11 16:22:10 Thought we would share with you what we are up to this week!
Sand and finish, 950sf of Parquet Oak wood flooring with commercial grade, oil base, Polo Plaz finish.
The floor has been sanded, we are applying 2nd coat of finish today and the last coat on Wednesday....Gorgeous!
3762 2018-06-11 16:22:09 No idea. Is there a prohibition against their manufacture?
3763 2018-06-11 16:21:49 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!

3765 2018-06-11 16:21:45 We need to respect the #Earth and #FightClimateChange. #PopeFrancis seems to be among the only Humane and Sane Christians left besides The Obamas. Evangelicals Support oil companies and coal companies killing innocent wildlife with their pollution and ruining our communities
3766 2018-06-11 16:21:41 I am v confused abt the Party's stand on env protection given the behaviour and action of Full MDP council and these remarks of their MP.
Kulhudhuffushi council keep discrediting anything to do with env as 'trouble makers. Oil pollution to problematic road design etc.
3767 2018-06-11 16:21:31 And on point 2.. I’m surprised those waved yellows weren’t red ones.. I would not be wanting to ride that exit on oil
3768 2018-06-11 16:21:26 Oil change guy: "we'll get you out of here in 15 minutes". 

Me: 
3769 2018-06-11 16:21:22 Most renewable energies are worse for the world than coal or oil.  The solution is nuclear energy which his already proven to be THE alternative but we need to divert the investments into it rather than wind or solar which is detrimental to the environment.
3770 2018-06-11 16:21:13 the fact that I went from paying $25 to $100 just for an oil change

3772 2018-06-11 16:21:12 The problem: The need to make profits separates the alignment between social good and individual good. It like mixing water with oil.

3785 2018-06-11 16:19:50 For ever hour of networking I need a day to recover. I can manage it though. I did a lot of international oil and gas exhibitions in my previous life and they near killed me with all the socialising.

3803 2018-06-11 16:18:40 They watched it work and then they robbed it from him. For the first time in his life the little boy managed to get 300 quality days of life without an epileptic seizure as a result of the cannabis oil. They acknowledged this then they took it away from him. It beggars belief.

3809 2018-06-11 16:18:06 let’s not piss off yet another country that supplies us with a crapload of oil, shall we?
3810 2018-06-11 16:18:01 A big well done to Y11 for the way you’ve approached the Geog exams. I’m so glad Paper 3 was a decent paper for your last one. Good job there was palm oil in the cheese puffs for us to discuss.  #geographygcse
3811 2018-06-11 16:18:00 Woman arrives at Heathrow w/cannabis oil for her son's epilepsy. 
The oil was confiscated.
This is criminal.
This treatment cured my sister (who is now 60 yo) when she was 
10 yo. A one year daily treatment stopped her seizures.
Denying this treatment is a sentence of misery.
3812 2018-06-11 16:17:51 ohh hahaha

3821 2018-06-11 16:17:22 How do you expect people to survive making less than $14/hr? That's about 400 bring home a week, 1600a month.  Rent/ mortgage 700+, cable 150+, phone 150+, car 300, electric 70, oil 100, .... now the person can't eat.

3872 2018-06-11 16:12:55 ....and...what proportion of oil use goes to light duty cars?    Transportation uses 67% of oil.  Of that, 37% goes to passenger cars.  Of those, 0.15% are plug ins globally.  so 0.67 x 0.37 x 0.0015 = 0.00037
Even 10% EV's displaces 2.5% of oil use.

3949 2018-06-11 16:06:25 Just put some smoked gruyere on a black pepper & olive oil triscuit and it was a great snacking decision.
3950 2018-06-11 16:06:07 All this shows is that Wilbur Ross knows what he talking about when he talks about tariffs. Warren Buffett was against the pipeline, why, because he shipped oil to US in his rail cars.
3951 2018-06-11 16:06:05 @RyanSeacrest omg! Lavender essential oil and aloe Vera mixture to help cure that sunburn!!!
3952 2018-06-11 16:06:03 I drank tea with lemon. Masarap pala yon.
3953 2018-06-11 16:06:01 Joe rubbing his feet against mine and he says damn your feet are so soft. Do you drown your feet in some kind of oil?
3954 2018-06-11 16:06:00 Why did I decide to wait here for my oil change

AND WHEN U GIVE THE OIL TO USA LIKE U R NOW IT COSTS CANADA A FORTUNE
3956 2018-06-11 16:05:53 to a certain extent i guess but it is an advantage like AB uses oil/wheat/Beef to its advantage....
3957 2018-06-11 16:05:50 Lol knowing my luck I'd rub it into my eyes and that would be it for me  I find that peppermint essential oil helps a lot with the pain.
3958 2018-06-11 16:05:44 I put option 2. If anyone read the question properly it said what option is best FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, and option 2 said to completely stop Palm Oil production and left he rainforest regrow and restore, so that was the correct one. All options are fine as long as you justify them
3959 2018-06-11 16:05:38 If you’d like to Crotch Guard Anti-Chafing Skin Care Oil I can send you a sample, let me know the best address to send it to.. 
3960 2018-06-11 16:05:35 I trust the genius visionary whose best world is a weird version of Mad Max where people are all fighting against having anything except guns. Nobody wants water, nobody wants oil or cool trucks or food, they just want guns by which to acquire other guns and defend themselves
3961 2018-06-11 16:05:34 Micellar water baaaanyak brand. Boleh try yg lain. Mungkin ada specific ingredient yg tak sesuai dgn skin. Takpun try oil cleanser, cleansing balm etc. No prob 
3962 2018-06-11 16:05:33 Stop! The french farmer union doesnt really care that palm oil destroyes every thing. They just want Total to buy their colza oil.
3963 2018-06-11 16:05:22 In 2013, the leading type of power generation by utilities in Canada is hydroelectricity, with a share of 60.1%. Nuclear (15.8%), natural gas (10.3%), coal (10%), wind (1.8%), fuel oil (1.2%), biofuels and waste (0.

3967 2018-06-11 16:05:11 Guess i’ll go get my oil changed and do my registration. :|
3968 2018-06-11 16:05:09 And we r turning back to a Production economy. 1. For Good American jobs 2. For National Security - can't be relying on Other Countries for Steel or Oil or Parts. They could cut us off which leaves us Weak and Disabled.
3969 2018-06-11 16:04:53 She’s so great. I missed the chance to see her in a small club right after Coconut Oil EP came out, a friend went and called it one of the greatest nights of her life
3970 2018-06-11 16:04:50 #GirlTalkZA Rosemary oil capsules & or Rosemary tea is great. Not too much of the tea tho'as it allows you to flow better

3978 2018-06-11 16:04:22 After drinking my water, eating my avo toast & putting coconut oil on I honestly can’t relate to some of y’all. Like how do y’all love yourselves??

3980 2018-06-11 16:04:05 uy pero mas masarap pala mag fry sa coconut oil, healthy pa
3981 2018-06-11 16:04:00 Yeah, exactly, they're like browned scrambled eggs with too much oil.  I want bubbly, airy egg pillows with some light 
sharp white cheddar cheese.
3982 2018-06-11 16:03:55 Mine’s a Neck Oil at White Hart Lane.
3983 2018-06-11 16:03:51 The govt in 2017 said that they will monitor oilfields of ONGC & Oil India & setting up separate committees led by a bureaucrat for supervision as part of its broader plan to make these firms more accountable & boost output so again Modi failed in that.
3984 2018-06-11 16:03:44 GOV , Big Oil and Ethanol are all batting against Green Clean Technology, Trump traded Ethanol for IOWA Corn Votes ,Even IOWA GOV got Ambassador to China Job . Talk about DC Swamp gas , this Agricultural Welfare payback rip off Americans . Auto makers realize this EV coming fast

3986 2018-06-11 16:03:20 Yes, that is the snake oil he's trying to sell this time....
3987 2018-06-11 16:03:13 Nohing "inadvertant" about it US "interventionis not & never has been to "solve one problem History shows US foreign policy is/always has een to ruthlessly pursue its own commercial (oil?) political interests-regardless of dire consequences to that country-eg Iraq Afg/stan Libya
3988 2018-06-11 16:03:12 Use coconut oil or other oils to remove everything! Face wipes ruin my skin  just make sure to wash it off cause coconut oil clogs everything
3989 2018-06-11 16:03:11 Denying that cortupt mad scientists conducting solar radiation management to benefit the oil and gas, and military industries is worse than denying climate change is happening.
3990 2018-06-11 16:03:03 You don't think we have oil and major reserves. All we ask play fair, he's said lets have neutral free tariffs between friends
3991 2018-06-11 16:03:01 A warm compressor on lower abdomen(hot water bottle)usually helps with period pains but over the counter I prefer Rosemary oil
3992 2018-06-11 16:02:58 If the burgers aren't wet from being drenched in oil. You might have a pancake house competitor that sells burgers the right way. 

Maybe it's just my wendys location? The burger buns come out very soggy.
3993 2018-06-11 16:02:48 Napaka lungkot naman!
3994 2018-06-11 16:02:46 Single parent-she is able to afford apt, health care, save for college because of oil and gas employment #COGCC
3995 2018-06-11 16:02:44 No because she wanted cannabis oil. The medication is 10:1 thc:cbd holland and barret is weak cbd oil... not a weak version it is only cbd
3996 2018-06-11 16:02:32 carrot oil smells sooo good. *drips some more in hair*

3998 2018-06-11 16:02:22 I heard my great grandma would pronounce "7up" as "Seven-naft." Mmm citrusy oil. 
3999 2018-06-11 16:02:09 Yet this little boy has been denied a small amount of Cannabis oil which will not just save his life but also greatly improve the quality of it. We can not allow this to happen. We must help #BillyCaldwell
4000 2018-06-11 16:02:00 Bought oil last week. Some saying it can go to 62 before bouncing. What you think.
4001 2018-06-11 16:01:44 i put oil
4002 2018-06-11 16:01:39 @Channel4News Hey Channel 4. I hope you will be covering the Billy Caldwell Cannabis Oil story this evening! Children across the UK are having their lives put at risk by the Home office. Please speak with @Keepbillyalive or @Hanseizuremum, @Help4Blathnaid, who need #CannabisOil!
4003 2018-06-11 16:01:31 Every time I see someone say “use coconut oil :)” for skincare I can feel my cystic acne coming back
4004 2018-06-11 16:01:30 life saver at home: petroleum + castor oil 
4005 2018-06-11 16:01:22 I've gr8 respect 4 u sir but you're talking about FDI but youth are talking about employment.where are 1million jobs per year instead of boon of low crude oil prices over  the last 4year. I strongly believe that BJP was my 1st choice in 2014 but now I'm with  and @RahulGandhi.
4006 2018-06-11 16:01:09 US must apologize to all Canadians for ripping off our country under NAFTA.
US companies under NAFTA treaty are simply looting Canadian Oil. Forestry, Auto, and Mining industries.
4007 2018-06-11 16:01:08 It’s like giving generator contract to oil and diesel sellers , they know that with the availability of prepaid meters, they can’t steal from the masses with their estimated Billings.
4008 2018-06-11 16:01:01 -prinito ang loaf bread kasi walang toaster or oven

4011 2018-06-11 16:00:44 Hell with them all!
They have never liked America and Americans anyway.
It’s time for us to do things for ourselves. We need to produce our own metals and oil ...
4012 2018-06-11 16:00:42 La Guerra del Chaco, fue la contienda donde la Shell y Standard Oil usaron como peones a soldados bolivianos y paraguayos. La guerra que profundizó la miseria que nos ahoga hasta hoy por culpa de los trust internacionales que querían el petroleo del chaco.
4013 2018-06-11 16:00:39 Scraping charges subsidises *only* those who drive - supporting car & oil industries, at the expense of the #NHS.
4014 2018-06-11 16:00:31 I tried to contact Mo' about it. I've a friend who used to suffer with a dislocated shoulder every night until he rubbed comfrey oil on to it before sleeping. Now? No more waking up in the night in pain!  Honest mate, ' stuff really works. Get some for your kit bag!  lol..YNWA!!

4016 2018-06-11 16:00:19 Try oil control powder by black opal. That helped me a lot. It’s a powder you can also use it as a foundation
4017 2018-06-11 16:00:17 หาเพื่อนไปร้านหมอนวดจ้า ไม่ไหวแล้วว ลุยงานทุกวันนนน
4018 2018-06-11 16:00:10 We shouldn't feel that we are inferior to them, but the inability of the Arab countries to produce almost anything on their own is a dangerous and short-sighted policy.  Oil won't last forever
However in fairness, you guys do have some very good programmers masha'Allah
4019 2018-06-11 16:00:09 Went to @CanadianTire for an oil change and my muffler fell off 10mins after I left and there are screws in my tires. WTF!!! @CanadianTire #scarborough #theworst

4023 2018-06-11 15:59:59 I think I might try blending the Japanese camellia oil (unscented) with an aromatherapy oil. I wish I had some hinoki (Japanes cypress) oil but I do have orange ginger & vetiver. Might make a good moisturizer too.
4024 2018-06-11 15:59:44 Seriously people... CBD oil is NOT CANNABIS OIL. You can't get cannabis oil in holland and barrett! This young lad has a 10:1 ratio thc:cbd i believe.
4025 2018-06-11 15:59:44 No, you meant it.
4026 2018-06-11 15:59:43 Mandy, Shouldn’t you be off complaining about how living above your means has caused all your financial problems?
4027 2018-06-11 15:59:37 Stir fried rice with leftover chicken. Scallions, courgette, broad beans, mangetout 'n peppers. Flash fried in Sesame oil 'n garlic. Beer.
Strawberries.  #KC
4028 2018-06-11 15:59:34 Look for more cheating to go on as oil producers like the Saudi’s try to quickly cash in on the rise of oil prices before they dip again.

4030 2018-06-11 15:59:12 You guys in Ottawa .. all parties .. need to get pipelines to tidewater built and at capacity. I want to choose where our oil goes.
4031 2018-06-11 15:59:06 Q from floor "This event is #CreatingWakanda, so what is Africa's vibranium?"

We shouldn't have mindset of Africa relying on resources; America produces more oil! Let's move away from mythical idea that we can just wait to strike oil or find diamonds.

4042 2018-06-11 15:57:55 You're absolutely right, cars are way more flexible. You just have to ignore that they destroy cities & economic activity, require a politically problematic resource (oil) to run. Also there's that pesky global warming, destroy the planet thing.  Other than that, totally flexible

There is an email reminding me not to miss the sale on beard oil though.
4052 2018-06-11 15:57:23 I have put a coat of Formbys Tung oil on this once a day since May 12. One day I did two coats.  I think it's done.  I have to French cleat the back and deliver this puppy.
4053 2018-06-11 15:57:17 I’m sitting in the coffee shop I went to for the last date I’ve been on (4 years ago). Thundercat “Them Changes” is playing. I’m drinking decaf Earl Grey. Somebody please immortalize me in an oil painting. I’ll be here til 4.

4058 2018-06-11 15:56:53 Why do I think she probably blows her money on going out, eating out, purchasing items she does not need and cannot afford  instead of saving for necessities like co-pays.  But, what do I know since I cannot seem to formulate articulate thought.
4059 2018-06-11 15:56:45 There are always natural alternatives. The pest issues could be better helped with just peppermint oil sprayed! Companion planting that deters Invaders. We don't need to make any poisonous toxins.
4060 2018-06-11 15:56:39 So far we haven't had that. Groups that tend to come in are teens who think it's funny to squeeze oil paints onto our yarn -_-
4061 2018-06-11 15:56:35 ok, a bit off topic Robbie but are you aware of Comfrey Oil? 100% herbal, sometimes called Knitbone. mends broken bones, fractures, pulled muscles, sprains. Kills pain if damage ain't too severe. I used it morning and night on my dog's fracture, for12 days. Vet amazed at results.
4062 2018-06-11 15:56:24 suggest me oil cleanser for jerawat pasir
4063 2018-06-11 15:55:55 Are you nuts?  All these companies which are opening new plants here, the coal, car, oil, technology, retail, construction, machinery jobs all expanding. Do you realize that there are more jobs available now than people seeking employment?
4064 2018-06-11 15:55:42 We fry our veggie patty in soybean oil in a gluten free fryer that only cooks fries
4065 2018-06-11 15:55:42 Teh U>s. susdiezes oil, farming, andmany more industries, and our tarrifs are jsut as high. Dos knowledgeable  economist (not on Trump'sr team) believe in  a global trading & econom. Trump's suporters have never been outside their bubble.
4066 2018-06-11 15:55:37 Low-carbon initiatives are worthwhile to reduce our dependency on oil however to completely eliminate it is a pipe dream.  Science is not even close to providing a realistic alternative, todays electric vehicles are not practical or environmentally friendly.
4067 2018-06-11 15:55:37 Because unless you can figure out how to make them, you will always be reliant on others, who can then take advantage of your need for them.
Whereas they don't really need your money since a lot of your money comes from Allah(swt) through them buying your oil in the first place
4068 2018-06-11 15:55:25 $oil $cl taking down the entire iron condor here. T/P price triggered. Da** those commissions are pricey...
4069 2018-06-11 15:55:19 Seriously considering taking a sabbatical and interning with a motorcycle touring company. 3 months washing bikes, changing oil, and driving a support truck sounds like a nice summer.
4070 2018-06-11 15:55:16 As I want oil&gas prices brought down around world,to help yourselves&economy,as these two are phasing out as I ask owners of these to prepare to replace with new tech coming as business,solar energy is one,yet I will create more opportunities for all oil&coal CO.'s in new fields
4071 2018-06-11 15:55:15 like at one point you fight massive, oil rig sized robots named Marx and Engels 

it's a Good Game
4072 2018-06-11 15:55:08 Coconut oil?? For bruises? Where do I find such a thing?
4073 2018-06-11 15:54:56 You would have to import more and higher cost medium and likely sour crudes to replace Canadian oil.
4074 2018-06-11 15:54:56 Have you tried adding in our Daily Repair Facial Oil to your skincare routine to combat dryness?
4075 2018-06-11 15:54:41 Need to get my oil changed
4076 2018-06-11 15:54:39 Sorry my American friend but your stats are off.  ...and on top of that, there are Canadian, European and Asian players in the oil sands....plus there is the oil from Southern Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland.  It's 41%...period.  Enjoy your drive.

With your dollar on top. Yet buy oil and gas and power CHEAP. 99%of what we export for oil you buy cheap. Who's the thieves?
4118 2018-06-11 15:51:17 Obv i would choose ‘simple micellar cleansing water’ over garnier micellar water. My all time favourite cleansing oil ofc would be ‘neutrogena’ since i have been using it for 3yrs already it does prevent me from breaking out bcs it removes my makeup entirely.
4119 2018-06-11 15:51:13 try it! a sephora employee gave me a sample of it & I bought the full size when I finished it. its so bomb it balances out your skin, my face is clearing up & its helping my face from overproducing oil

4141 2018-06-11 15:49:27 Trump is a negotiator, something no other politicians are, the rest are mainly criminals. That is why clintons carters obamas increased the debt for Americans. We are leaking money on foreign cars, oil, technology.

4168 2018-06-11 15:46:19 There would be some initial damage. For example, Canadian oil is sold to the USA, refined there, and then sold back (for considerably more). If trade were cut off, the USA would lose money, and Canada would basically shut down.

4173 2018-06-11 15:46:01 Another scarcity looms. So long as crude oil price is going up, subsidy will follow same direction. No two ways about it. Imagine what could have happened if pump price of petrol had remained at ₦87. ₦113/litre for subsidy
4174 2018-06-11 15:45:54 ehh bukan crude oil ke
4175 2018-06-11 15:45:44 One way Canada can mitigate climate change is by starting to invest in clean energy and stop bailing out oil companies. Purchasing a $4.5 billion pipeline was not a way to do that. The Kinder Morgan expansion must be stopped.
4176 2018-06-11 15:45:43 Let’s slide this @paulkrugman opinion next to the one where he said the economy would tank the moment Trump was elected. Hey, Paul, how much is your snake oil selling for today??
4177 2018-06-11 15:45:40 TBH I think that a lot of the tech is much closer than we think, just that oil is still big business so it's been blocked. I do however feel a new sympathy for our elders. I see why new tech can be daunting /unfamiliar. Imagine having to explain driving to ur grandkids,

The lactose and other milk solids coagulate and are meticulously removed.
4184 2018-06-11 15:44:57 So where does NNPC get the differential from? This is an institution that runs on a loss. NNPC has always maintained that based on its Act, it reserves the right to deduct costs (incl. subsidy) at source, from gross oil sales. This explains the opacity & lack of accountability.
4185 2018-06-11 15:44:56 Odd ! It should be... think logically and then articulate those thoughts!
4186 2018-06-11 15:44:54 Russia is nowhere near as powerful as the Soviet Union. And their going to get weaker. Theyre a land locked country with one export...oil.
4187 2018-06-11 15:44:37 Fact is we germans still know. How are the indians? Ah yes most of them died when again? And ah yes slavery of africans. Lets better not talk present boy. American military forces have been busy around thr globe always protecting 'their' oil.

4192 2018-06-11 15:44:18 1. Yes, 2014, the exact year oil prices plummeted. What about the preceding 2 decades?
2. Do you have an English language source that I could, you know, check?
3. Sure, mistakes were made. How would neoliberalism helped? What about  Venezuela’s entire history of western vampirism

4213 2018-06-11 15:43:05 US oil production has jumped by 500kbpd since March.  Russia and Saudi Arabia just said they increased by almost 300k combined.  This does not include production added weekly.  Demand is weakening across the world.  I have no idea how the bullish narrative can hold much longer.

4260 2018-06-11 15:38:06 Russia's main export, especially to Europe, is gas. Not oil. And gas didn't have a post 08 run up. Gas has been flat/down since 2008 through 2014.

4270 2018-06-11 15:36:51 "Because when i read it again, it sounded awful and I didn't mean it." Why can we never get simple and honest answers like this?  But no, let me throw up a word salad that is both insulting and tries to make me look powerful.
4271 2018-06-11 15:36:45 Oil is not the future of energy. But people and skills would forever be in demand to drive the technologies of the future. That is why investment in education and skills acquisition can't be dismissed. See what #dpforafrica is doing with #NoChildLeftBehind #SDGs

4273 2018-06-11 15:36:36 Say its sometime around 2005, oil prices are high, US asks Saudi to increase production. Saudi calculation is: how much is that going to push oil prices down? can we increase production without harming our reservoirs? will we have buyers for that oil? ...

4289 2018-06-11 15:35:47 ... I’ll just switch to olive oil.
4290 2018-06-11 15:35:40 The Saudi's could increase #oil output to 10.29m b/d (from 10.01m b/d in May) through until the end of 2018, and their compliance over the course of the #OPEC deal would still be 100%... how quickly they could do this is another question... #OOTT

4300 2018-06-11 15:35:09 RT @BBolander: Anything can be a story if you make someone emotionally connect with it. Anything can be boring as an oil change and as dry as a January Christmas tree if you don't bother doing any emotional work. #writingtip
4301 2018-06-11 15:35:08 They look painful, you’ll need to get some Avon skin so soft dry oil spray for next time. Try a cold shower 
4302 2018-06-11 15:35:03 Maybe if they are just labeled “low fat.”? But I’m not 100% sure where people are getting all the oils if they are eating real food? A lot of Keto plans end up including lots of oil? Vegan may include oil, but whole food plant based is...well...whole food? Some go with zero oil.
4303 2018-06-11 15:34:55 except what fear of the policeman are we talking about? what's the US going to do if Saudi doesn't raise oil production? stop selling fighter jets to saudi? stop buying Saudi oil? Think of it like this..
4304 2018-06-11 15:34:53 Not getting an oil change midway through a road trip cost me a car, a job, and a relationship.
4305 2018-06-11 15:34:50 Trump's comment is antithetical. Obama never allowed it as he increased sanctions, opened up US oil reserves to drop prices hitting Putin in the wallet, etc. Trump wants Putin back in G7 to reward him for usurping Crimea.
4306 2018-06-11 15:34:49 "National Oil production has fallen by 10% recently. Analysists are still unsure why."

4326 2018-06-11 15:33:10 When people say that one person can’t change the world they are wrong. Since I’ve been home my sister has stopped buying products that use palm oil. She has also been using wash clothes instead of paper towels to reduce waste. We compost. It’s the little changes we start to make.
4327 2018-06-11 15:33:07 At that time.
Our oil for local consumption will be drilled in Naira, refine in Naira and sold in Naira.

The dollar variable both in cost and freight will be gone for good.

Large chunk of our FX earnings would be subsequently retained.

Better days ahead.

4338 2018-06-11 15:32:31 ทำไมอะ ทำไมทำกับความรู้สึกอย่างนี้ มันเเย่มากๆ มันไม่มีทางให้อภัยได้ มันไม่มีทางเป็นเหมือนเดิมแล้ว
4339 2018-06-11 15:32:12 The way to stop this is to stop turning their homes into rubble, their farmland into desert & insure oil wealth from their countries is returned into their countries purse for infrastructure development. ... But as that's complicated and not politically beneficial for you Nige..
4340 2018-06-11 15:32:12 Russia produces many of the same natural resources as Canada. Wood, oil, natural gas. If the US shuts out Canada, Mexico and Europe they will have to source those materials from Russia.
4341 2018-06-11 15:32:10 Thank you for sharing your unsurprising "articulate thoughts" on the millions of Americans who happily reside outside the 212 area code.
4342 2018-06-11 15:31:55 Awwww I’m sorry it made you feel that way but I’ve heard not diluting it with water can make it like too powerful for the body you know? Sometimes I do get nauseous if I eat too quickly after drinking it. What does the tea tree oil treat?
4343 2018-06-11 15:31:49 Agreed but Trump has been involved in world markets for decades and knows how to play that game, we need a team that can match his skills (hard to do) we can call him names that hasn't worked

How about getting our oil to market, Trudeau has killed 3 major projects bad move

4346 2018-06-11 15:31:32 So proud of my Kate. She only made $203, but the first thing she did was call and asked how much she owed for her tag & oil change.

I REFUSE to raise entitled brats. They’ll pay for everything until they’re rich
4347 2018-06-11 15:31:28 Nice reversal in Crude Oil today!  Looking for it bounce another 5-10% prior to peak summer driving season on July 4th!  

$USO $UWT #OPEC $UCO
4348 2018-06-11 15:31:25 How's that FREE trade working for Canada? We already are the underdog overall. Bc u.s. had forced us to sell solely to them. U.S. OIL INDUSTRY is paying protectors to high jack the building of our pipeline to the coast bc THEY don't want us to get our oil to other markets.
4349 2018-06-11 15:31:25 She knew exactly what she was saying lol its that superiority complex that made so many of us vote against them... keep the insults coming.. only motivates us more
4350 2018-06-11 15:31:19 I need an oil change, am currently 200+ miles overdue. Wanted to schedule it last week but I didn't get a day off, and now this.

And my boss tried to call me in a couple minutes ago, too. No.
4351 2018-06-11 15:31:00 Alaskans own 1,448,000 shares of ELNUSA TBK PT, worth $42,162. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in INDONESIA.
4352 2018-06-11 15:30:46 My thoughts exactly. Our PM has SIX separate bi lateral meeting booked with other countries coming up. Add in a bigger pipeline to tidewater and new oil upgraders in Alberta and watch the US gas prices skyrocket as well. #byebyeusa
4353 2018-06-11 15:30:44 Might be his best action for the nation ever!
4354 2018-06-11 15:30:34 But a collections agent means you aren't paying your bills; they had to send your unpaid bills to collections. You know we are still living under Obamacare, right? @mandy_velez trump tried to repeal and replace, but dems/rinos voted AGAINST FIXING IT!! so you're stuck with Ocare

4358 2018-06-11 15:30:16 One way to stop Middle East Terrorist is stop buying Middle East and OPEC oil, USA energy independence stops them from Dollars at least and secures our national defense. Venezuela socialism is funded too by oil export as well. Very few see the truth this way....
4359 2018-06-11 15:29:54 Might have used the wrong word - I meant rule by the oil industry. Hard to describe the recent state purchase any other way...
4360 2018-06-11 15:29:54 Mas virgin pa sa virgin coconut oil
4361 2018-06-11 15:29:52 Thank God @JustinTrudeau bought the pipeline. Canada needs to get oil to tidewater so we can expand our market away from USA. Trump's  example of what happens when rely on 1 market. I worry abt environment but I live in the real world where our economy needs to grow and thrive.
4362 2018-06-11 15:29:52 This man changed my oil, vacuumed my car, now he cleaning my windows. He might as well wash my car too cause she dirttttyyyy
4363 2018-06-11 15:29:30 Anything extra plus you still get our oil cheap. You also get power cheaper which Canadians pay the difference and ends up costing us MORE than u.s. for our own power!
4364 2018-06-11 15:29:21 Boots nu7 for men - their oil control is AMAZING
4365 2018-06-11 15:29:17 lol.. israel helping Iranians... ROFL... That help stopped when Iran stopped sending free oil to israel and israel stole the oil pipeline.

4369 2018-06-11 15:28:55 Great article @AlexNicest though no mention of climate re oil and esp gas? Also - great title!

4373 2018-06-11 15:28:21 We have recycling depots for steel which we turn into pipe which u.s. uses for oil industry amoung other things. In which they buy Canadian oil at steep discount and use those pipes to transport it and sell at profit. Right now that steel traded FREE. So Canada doesn't get
4374 2018-06-11 15:28:12 First time you change your oil and you don’t know how to act smh
4375 2018-06-11 15:27:47 @realDonaldTrump You have an issue with stoping plastic pollution of our oceans? Is it due to ur love of oil and its use in making plastic? Is every body of water your private waste disposal system? Or do you just not give a shit unless it lines your pockets? Disgusting slob!

4377 2018-06-11 15:27:34 Yes, it’s 2018 and our “worth” as women is still defined by our physical attractiveness, not our achievements or the content of our character. The irony of these situations is usually the person (Male) doing the “defining” is no oil painting himself

4382 2018-06-11 15:27:22 spoonfeeding the population harsh realities is easier with the aid of sugary sweeteners but don't expect the cod liver oil to go down too smoothly. I would mention castor oil but some users report "no taste"
4383 2018-06-11 15:27:13 Not necessarily against it lol it’s just painful to see the 5 Minute Oil Change Bowl. With a 5-7 team playing a 6-6 team in the middle of the day. Like come on now.

4385 2018-06-11 15:26:51 Veganism is and should be an inherently a political choice and is not an individual act. A rise in veganism should be celebrated AND we should be questioning how vegan food is produced wrt labour and the environment (soy/palm oil/ cash crops generally)
4386 2018-06-11 15:26:28 still raging

saw some butteries in the benefit buffet last night. one of the ingredients was palm oil

in fucking butteries!

the fuck is going on @asda? 

sort your shit out!
4387 2018-06-11 15:26:14 Heh. 
Love you, Laurie.
4388 2018-06-11 15:26:07 So assuming the reactor was already functional or reasonably predictable, the oil motive of the obvious villains falls apart, and you're left with the religious and power motives, to create a nuclear holocaust in Israel and then prompt total militarization of the U.S.
4389 2018-06-11 15:26:06 It started out with baby oil
4390 2018-06-11 15:25:58 Fantastic. This is good for Kosmos Energy as well as The Oil & Gas industry in Equatorial Guinea.

4393 2018-06-11 15:25:49 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
4394 2018-06-11 15:25:48 Sesame chili oil. I could just chug it
4395 2018-06-11 15:25:42 reading her tweets about not having $$ for doctor and blaming America...

FU bitch, show us your credit card statements and shoe closet.
4396 2018-06-11 15:25:11 The market incentive is that approximately 50% of the population is concerned about the environment, and this method may produce carbon-neutral fuel as a direct competitor to oil. These people will pay for that option.
4397 2018-06-11 15:25:04 Country Boys Can Survive. Ask Bocephus!
4398 2018-06-11 15:25:01 You could have argued about ecotourism for option two and how educating tourists on the impacts of the palm oil industry on the natural environment helps to generate income for local people. You could have also said about volunteering abroad and the positive economic impact.
4399 2018-06-11 15:24:54 @FreshMenuIndia stooping to such low standards day on day?! Taking acdicity to the next level by adding vegetable oil instead of egg to desserts?! At least mention it upfront for people to stay away!!
4400 2018-06-11 15:24:41 Oil rollback tomorrow. So I guess gas price is now $144262849201648.3749 per liter? 
4401 2018-06-11 15:24:40 Jamaican Black Castor oil helps too! Heat it up and massage it into your scalp and massage your head and it will stimulate hair growth and you’ll also have silky hair ! (2 times a week or once a week)

4405 2018-06-11 15:24:23 Well he hid the fact he works for the oil industry ! I'm not sure about you but I want to be free of WAR for oil and all the Middle East issues. Also if Tesla fails the entire EV supply chain will be located in Asia. Think about that before you open your mouth. No really think !

4410 2018-06-11 15:23:47 It was Banana Chips made in Coconut oil. It made South Indian People Intelligent. Hence the name Intel. Kuch bhi bolne ka
4411 2018-06-11 15:23:44 It isn't too late. The trim will open up the ends for the oil to hydrate. Once the hair is hydrated, it can be trained. The new growth will come in stronger and easier to manage. A couple more trims and you'll be on your way to a good beard.
4412 2018-06-11 15:23:42 me: can you boil things in oil? why don’t people do that. 
deep frying. it’s called deep frying.
4413 2018-06-11 15:23:35 Harper was too busy promoting American interests to promote Canadian national energy strategy. What's happening w Trump should wake up Canadians to fact bringing our oil to tidewater will make Canada's economy stronger. We could eliminate reliance on USA oil market over time.

They can fuck right the hell off.
4416 2018-06-11 15:23:19 Racist trump is padding his pockets and those of his wealthy elite buddies at the expense of the working class. That tax cut went 80% to the wealthy and the part we got is going to the wealthy in the form of oil company profits. Seen the price of gas lately? ALL PART OF THE PLAN!

4446 2018-06-11 15:20:08 Big problem for T-unions and some in the Yes movement. We are only adding to inevitable disaster when we delay diversification of industry. That "major employer" is sustaining the oil bubble and worsening the environment. Who will the communities blame when that bubble bursts?
4447 2018-06-11 15:20:05 In a dry pan (no oil) fry some onion and bacon then add a tub of cream cheese use this as a cheat carbonara sauce for pasta. Add garlic and mushrooms if you like

4449 2018-06-11 15:19:57 Even still the type of dark skins that are attractive to a lot of men are dripped in oil and have the body of an Instagram model with perfect skin . Its all just so stupid and the fact that men try to act like this isn’t a reality is stupid .

Canada has infrastructure for shipping to basically only one country, guess who it is?
4454 2018-06-11 15:19:24 Great insight @websterdrake regardless of future it’s probably sufficient to say E&P budgets will remain restrained enough to tighten market to an oil price high enough to justify activity which seems to be higher than the doldrums?

4469 2018-06-11 15:18:10 Ohhhh no baby. You did this wrong. The point of double cleansing is to use oil to breakdown dirt sebum, and foam to break down the oil. This is a gel cleanser which is also water based. Water cleanser + water cleanser= over drying.

4475 2018-06-11 15:17:44 Last year this week, crude drew but total commercial inventory increased by 6.8 MBLS. Propane, other oils and residual fuel oil increase accounted for all of it. This trend likely to continue this year as NGPL and propane usually increase.

4481 2018-06-11 15:16:56 Maybe instead of acting like a child and imposing tariffs on other goods/services, you sit down at the negotiation table like a big boy, and say, "okay we get your problem, you have needs too how about we work out a deal with a discount on oil imports and you can keep the tariffs
4482 2018-06-11 15:16:53 That is why I cook at home. If you do eat out always take a couple drops of oregano oil. 
4483 2018-06-11 15:16:37 The US at least could lower its import costs by taking advantage of discounted heavy oil from Canada, granted subject to rail costs currently but the discount of WCS is deep enough on average to justify it and there’s plenty of excess capacity

4490 2018-06-11 15:16:18 Knowing Trudeau, Trudeau probably told Trump what he thought Trump would want to hear and then turned around and said something completely different.  Trudeau bought an oil company so he didn't have to stand up to the BC premier.  Trudeau is a pot head.

My doggie Cleo, got skunked. Actually, I don't find the

Quite simple: stop bombing the shit out of their countries to ease the paranoid fears of Israel & the economic interests of Big Oil Corps.

4649 2018-06-11 15:00:22 I love the @TODAYshow but this segment on “natural” beauty products is misleading. Having turmeric, rose oil, or coffee on a label does not mean safe for our bodies or OUR environment. Would love to see @ewg ratings shown alongside segments like this or pure plant-based recipes.
4650 2018-06-11 15:00:21 Yes, that’s amazing. Also liked the “chevron” mariner essentially washing into One Allen Center where shell oil is housed if memory serves. If not then close enough for gov’t Work. Seriously, not just Houston stuff, but the entire series is so well crafted and deep with meaning.
4651 2018-06-11 15:00:18 hala sad gusto ko eat fried chicken tonight kaso wala oil dito sa bahay right now. therefore let's eaattt maggi kari!!!!! pag-asa ng bayaaaaan hihi
4652 2018-06-11 15:00:08 We export more to Canada than we import from them, had a $12.5 billion trade surplus for goods and services in 2016, exporting $320.1 billion and importing $307.6 billion. Increase in US oil production due to increase in Brent.  If that price falls back to $35-$40/barrel,
4653 2018-06-11 15:00:08 It's a fantastic engineering achievement, long overdue since the oil came onshore in the 80s, took an SNP gov to get it done.
4654 2018-06-11 15:00:08 @LBC people grow #cannabis 100% organic and #medical cannabis #oil and is made with co2. Because illegal in U.K. most oil produced with #butane #gas. To say there are problems prescribing cannabis because it’s phycho tropic whilst you can give someone ketamine is a croc of shit.
4655 2018-06-11 14:59:52 You mean decommissioning of the oil platform?
4656 2018-06-11 14:59:48 My boo getting my oil changed 
4657 2018-06-11 14:59:46  I get 4 6-month oil changes included with purchase. I’m sure I paid for it somewhere. At least in red lights driving to Santa Monica.
4658 2018-06-11 14:59:45 I made the mistake once of over-reacting to how delicious I thought a cookie was a customer bought me from a gas station. 
She now brings them with every oil change and I eat them because it makes her smile as we share a treat.

And that’s the kind of person I am deep down.

4668 2018-06-11 14:59:08 One thing you can count on Canada, we're so reliable a supplier of oil and electricity that we would NEVER turn off the tap or flip the breaker. This isn't about Americans, only one American and his boot licking entourage

4670 2018-06-11 14:59:04 Well, the oil should add moisture back to the burned bread.

The bar is set low here.
4672 2018-06-11 14:58:58 Great so when I need my brakes or rotors or oil changed I know who to call
4673 2018-06-11 14:58:37 It appears to me that all the countries on this chart are non oil-dependent economies. It should be safe to say that our rating as one of the fastest growing economies under the previous administration was due to high oil prices.
4674 2018-06-11 14:58:36 Looking at the ingredients of food in the local "hippie mart", most everything has soybean oil, palm oil, and canola oil....not to mention the non-dairy milk variants.

4678 2018-06-11 14:58:24 Do any of our trading partners create, mine or build ANYTHING that we cannot create, mine or build ourselves?  Perhaps TITANIUM or Aluminum.   What else?  I can't think of anything right off hand. Certainly not oil or products made from oil.
4679 2018-06-11 14:58:21 Trim it, properly shampoo and condition, and throw some oil in it. Use a boars hair brush to train it. And most of all, quit being a little bitch about it. :p

4685 2018-06-11 14:57:34 Remember when straws, disposable cups, plates & shopping bags were all made of paper? Then, tree huggers (a just cause) started pushing plastic as an alt? Or, was another entity behind the push? Plastic (now clogging oceans & landfills) is made of oil. Who had the most to gain?

4700 2018-06-11 14:56:00 I highly recommend undiluted lavender oil!! I cut a finger while cleaning crap out of the the drain, washed it well, but quickly became painful, hot, dark red...put lavender oil directly on it twice in 2 hrs before bed. By morning, painless and normal colored, AND cut was sealed!

4709 2018-06-11 14:55:03 So my point is we have good evidence that sugar, vegetable oil +carbohydrates junk food, and lack of sun exposure cause ill health and depression. Video games are not on that list. Cubicle/ florescent covers “no sun”. Video games are then a hostile cultural statement.

What is going on?

4817 2018-06-11 14:42:15 An oil shill.
4818 2018-06-11 14:42:11 I obviously never wrote that the conservatives disagreed with the liberals on tariffs. The biggest disagreement deals with energy policy and the Alberta tar sands as well as a few oil pipelines from the west.
4819 2018-06-11 14:42:09 @LBC @ShelaghFogarty I think you're a great presenter. But I'm shocked how clueless you appear to be about the beneficial effects of the oil and the industry we run in the UK for the benefit of people outside of the UK.

Things like oil that's not landed but sold on the spot markets is counted as Westminster revenue, pretty much everywhere I work now is FPSO's, so that's a healthy chunk.

4934 2018-06-11 14:31:40 The Prime Minister said, ‘Look, here’s the essence of our trading relationship. We sell you a lot of oil and energy and you sell us a lot of food and manufactured goods. It is a trillion dollar relationship. ”

4993 2018-06-11 14:25:44 Venezuela problems take time to Google and understand. But it has nothing to do with industry or expressway or Modi. Chavez was like Seeman and did not invest in oil industry and ruined the country.
4994 2018-06-11 14:25:39 So days before Trans-Mtn. May 31 deadline date it's reported that 100 litres of oil spilled from Kamloops KM facility. Only after Trudeau shills out $4.5 Billion do we find out it was really 4,800 litres. Cover-up to avoid fact Trudeau overpaid for an old, leaky pipeline? #bcpoli

4997 2018-06-11 14:25:29 Being told that "we are made of stardust" as a means of making me "feel better" is exactly the same as a cashier telling me to "have a blessed day" after buying three cans of tuna, Doritos, and some motor oil.

5064 2018-06-11 14:20:00 they have time to make a meal? By the same token, I assume, @dumpstxrfire that you make all your food 100% by scratch then? Never bought a bag of chips? Only buy potatoes, oil & salt bc to do otherwise would be lazy. Or you’ve never bought a frozen meal or microwave popcorn?

5067 2018-06-11 14:19:37 It is beyond prejudices. It's about land and resources. USA and Israel want ME they have been breaking it down for last 100 years. Oil, minerals gas, rare earth, metals are in abundance not mention the drugs from Afghanistan to help find illegal wars. They are not bothered 1/2
5068 2018-06-11 14:19:35 #MAGA Alert: My petty preening (pp) president* .@realDonaldTrump has declared victory with his upcoming meeting with KJU.

5081 2018-06-11 14:18:03 Nobody knows how to make real buttermilk pancakes anymore: letting the batter ferment overnight before cooking, for example. 
French toast is an art: between the custard, choice of frying oil and even the pan, I don't trust an establishment with it.

5086 2018-06-11 14:17:44 Yup. So many moving parts and people but it can always been simplified. I recommend reading @Dry_Observer for his explanation on Russia/oil.
5087 2018-06-11 14:17:39 Ah, heard of electric cars?  I own a solar energy company, and we install chargers in almost all installs.  That will reduce demand for oil if we had more nukes.

5097 2018-06-11 14:16:24 Maybe you should regulate your dairy industry, instead of pouring all that extra milk down the drain. You are a special kinda stupid. Get your priorities straight. Maybe we should turn the hydro and oil off?

5127 2018-06-11 14:12:20 Restaurant pancakes rarely are very good, they’re usually just big flabby sponges, but if you cook them with oil in the pan, you can get a great crispy edge and they are delicious.

In backyard 
And a tiny hole
For an oil lamp

5129 2018-06-11 14:12:02 Any comment on the fact that it is now obvious that JM sold OUR oil exploration rights for a shady immigration deal that probably has cost the life of many, children included. Well said @RobertaMetsola.
5130 2018-06-11 14:12:01 Cool story. Except it ignores all of history. Does Standard Oil ring a bell?

And you realize that most rural areas only have one ISP right? How did the government create that?

5165 2018-06-11 14:09:09 It's time Treadau grows some balls and provides the US with real tariffs. If @realDonaldTrump thinks free trade is fool trade, perhaps we add an export tariff on our oil, water, power, potash, and uranium.
5166 2018-06-11 14:09:08 He's half right. We are in a world of discontinuous change,  different dynamic groupings of leaders from very weak to a few very strong, & USA dominance of production of oil in the US that's now exporting, + Laffer cruve shft. Analysis has to also @Lars9596 @RalfKlein8888

5197 2018-06-11 14:05:16 You are right to mention the crude oil in Turkana.  The oligarchs are looting it.  That too will be probed accordingly.  Everything belonging to the People must be recovered and returned to them.  Nothing will escape the REVOLUTION.
5198 2018-06-11 14:05:14 Definitely anti-Semitic, but also a kick in the face to all who want positive changes FOR THE PEOPLE instead of a government that is bed with banksters, oil men and billionaires while ALWAYS waging war to further enrich themselves.

5200 2018-06-11 14:05:05 @ShelaghFogarty must totally condemn the woman smuggling CBD oil as she knew the law and broke it. Much like Tommy Robinson? @lbc @NickFerrariLBC

5203 2018-06-11 14:04:40 Trump’s oil company cronies are loving this. “Donald here is your strategy. Stir up  in the Middle East and elsewhere, put upward pressure on oil prices. Here’s your check.”
5204 2018-06-11 14:04:35 Yes, there was a time when this was true.

But the Industrial Revolution was 150 years ago.

And renewables are viable.

So stop trying to save
dirty coal & dirty oil;
their time
has come...and gone.
5205 2018-06-11 14:04:32 One of the all time great! Papa was working in oil… When he came in Europe with mummy and little brother, money was not an issue.

5210 2018-06-11 14:04:06 Hi Liah. If I skip moisturizer but use Facial Safflower oil instead, is it ok? most moisturiser cause me breakout and monetary-broke (since it is a bad investment). Pls advice.
5211 2018-06-11 14:03:55 I hope that the Q team, after they clear all the criminals out, go after all the big pharm companies and release cures to cancer and other diseases they apparently are sitting on. Same with oil companies sitting on tech that gives us way more miles per gallon. #qanon
5212 2018-06-11 14:03:45 So here’s a question for all God’s children - did God create oil to be used for the betterment of mankind or did he want us to stay in the jungle with no running water, sanitation, hospitals, schools, etc.? You know, like in the 3rd world...#FPope...
5213 2018-06-11 14:03:45 Some haven't had new books since the Nixon administration. Sadly throwing money at them isn't the answer either. Our local school made shitloads off the back of the oil boom. They built a million dollar football field while cutting after school programs and entire departments.

5230 2018-06-11 14:01:34 Congee. Rice cooker set to rice porridge. Then I brown a bit of chicken or pork cut in bite sized pieces in a small pot with a touch of olive oil. Add minced garlic, salt, pepper. Add cup of water. Bring to boil and season to tasty soup. Pour over congee.
5231 2018-06-11 14:01:30 That was the lying sod that claimed the oil was running out very soon when in actual fact its now expected to last till 2050. Oil production has doubled since 2015 but if we continue to Tax Oil at 50% when every other country in the World Tax at72% then we are only making BP rich

5236 2018-06-11 14:01:09 I think it is a question of texture, in that cookie dough tends to have oil in it in preparation for the cooking process. Some folks can't get past it, I suppose.

5245 2018-06-11 14:00:22 That's very true Pete. Some people should engage brain before opening mouth. One thing is for sure is spotters do NOT want to drop the company in it. If peeps want to go negative go do it on LSE. Swampies watch to.
5246 2018-06-11 14:00:21 Theres nothing better than a mobile mechanic for a friend. Call me for your next oil change or any other car issues
5247 2018-06-11 14:00:17 That's a popular, but wrong, idea. 
Oil and electricity have almost nothing to do with each other.  
They are not interchangeable (except for a very minor, ignorable percent at the margin).

Publicly calling the leader of a country we export billions in US goods to is beyond stupid, it's dangerous. What country do we import most of our foreign oil  from? Canada.

5274 2018-06-11 13:57:08 certainly not something as serious as MS. and it's not like he follows drs orders and just does the oil to give him some measure of control - he actively avoids treatment and won't take meds most of the time.

5305 2018-06-11 13:52:36 It could have been handled differently . And this is my concern. Andrew didn’t know how to phrase it . Supporting Justin is a path for destruction of Canada. The US doesn’t need anyone. They are almost %100 independent for oil.

5322 2018-06-11 13:50:45 Although, weirdly Standard & Poor's stated in 2014 that, even excluding oil, an independent Scotland would have an investment grade economy and would be given an AA rating. But you'll be right and S & P the professional ratings agency will be mistaken.
5323 2018-06-11 13:50:43 The regime is only keep to suck oil and gives no damn care about security, socio-economic and environmental manifestations in Turkana. Its about the kill at all levels of government.

5335 2018-06-11 13:48:50 Jesus kept company with tax collectors, poor people, sick people, and sinners of all kinds. His disciples once questioned why he allowed a prostitute to pour oil on his feet. So no. Jesus would bake the cake and call you a hypocrite.
5336 2018-06-11 13:48:34 yes, those are a little more generic and the one I got was handpicked basil leaves and organic unfiltered olive oil and smoked paprika sea salt.. kinda.
5337 2018-06-11 13:48:31 This morning, documents indicating millions in #Russian oil profits channeled thru #CarterPage during the US campaign. Patience, my friend. I trust #Putin to have hidden his efforts well but the truth will out.
5338 2018-06-11 13:48:28 If you do, brush a layer of oil onto the inside of the pie crust then a thin layer of cheese before you put the tomatoes in to act as a moisture barrier or the bottom crust will be sludge.
5339 2018-06-11 13:48:27 Wow. Great news that they want to ban palm oil.
5340 2018-06-11 13:48:27 โปรดอย่าอ้วนไปกว่าที่เจอล่าสุดเด็กตัวสูง รักษาหุ่นให้สมกับหน้าตาแสนสวยหน่อยเรา
5341 2018-06-11 13:48:20 Good. Do u know y Venezuela is in trouble? Bcos they didn't invest in industry but just obsessed using oil revenue to spend 
TN Seeman should learn lesson. Diversified Economy is key..depending 100% on farms is also a disaster.
5342 2018-06-11 13:47:46 Ladies, if you’re not hip already... get some Vitamin E oil and apply twice a day daily. 

Thank me later
5343 2018-06-11 13:47:44 Two politicians who looted in the name of weapons of mass destruction and oil for food.
5344 2018-06-11 13:47:37 I once marketed a product that mimicked coconut oil made by a company owned by nestle.  I wonder if some of money for big coconut is coming from the world’s largest food company
5345 2018-06-11 13:47:36 There’s a few things I do when I’m in that situation. 1st, I use CBD oil without THC. It’s significantly reduced my attacks. 2nd, find a way to exercise. Go for a walk, or in my case I’ll do an hour of elliptical. That seems to calm me down. The struggle is real. Good luck...
5346 2018-06-11 13:47:34 कोई विरोधाभास नही है। सुपर 30 नाम से 3 संस्थान है पहला आनंद का सुपर 30 जिससे 26 पास, अभयानंद सुपर 30 जिससे 9 पास एक Indian oil super 30 है।
5347 2018-06-11 13:47:32 Ok, just one more. The Canadian Prime Minister just spent $4.5 billion on a leaky 60 year old pipeline to ship the dirtiest oil on the planet through fragile ecosystems where he lacks social license. Said it was best for Canada. Just not for the planet. #kakistocracyliveshere
5348 2018-06-11 13:47:24 Sorry Mr woods. He's right. Canada is not bowing to u.s. you already get our oil and hydro at steep discounts. We could cut those things off especially now that we have refineries and oil to markets.
5349 2018-06-11 13:47:07 *ADRENALINE oil ;)
5350 2018-06-11 13:47:04 Your idea of diversification is excellent! It should have been done years before! But when you can’t flow your oil or alcool freely in the country, you know that we have a big problem of our own inside  to solve also before! We don’t have free market in !

5362 2018-06-11 13:45:46 The minerals do not degrade (like other UV filters), but the concern is dispersion of zinc oxide... after the sunscreen has been opened for a while the oil might separate from the minerals, compromising your protection. 1/2

5372 2018-06-11 13:44:13 people mock Italians but we get to eat bread soaked in oil and be like “genetically this is actually healthy for me”
5373 2018-06-11 13:44:10 We will keep our wood and oil and everything else and you guys can have a nice day...
5374 2018-06-11 13:44:04 The squeaky wheel gets the oil 
5375 2018-06-11 13:43:52 If you are worried about filling your gas tank you should consider that Trump approved the Keystone pipeline and we have now opened drilling in areas of Alaska off limits when Democrats controlled Congress. America is now an oil exporter once again.
5376 2018-06-11 13:43:49 I saw this dude cut up a potato, dip it in some hot oil, then he ATE it!  What will they think of next
5377 2018-06-11 13:43:42 They’re not. Everything you buy is going to cost more than the paltry amount you got back from the tax cut. You are being screwed by a snake oil salesman. Enjoy you culty kook-aid and don’t cry too hard when this all falls apart
5378 2018-06-11 13:43:34 We can't burn oil for another 80 years at present rate and not exceed our carbon budget to stay under 2° of warming. Almost have locked in that much already.

5382 2018-06-11 13:43:17 Hey nobody is putting a gun to your head to be the world police....which btw is just a cover for protecting your own financial interests. Proof? Where is the US military in Africa fighting the repeated genocide that takes place there??? Oh, that’s right...no oil there.
5383 2018-06-11 13:43:17 Libya’s wealth before and after 2011 has derived from dead dinosaurs (oil and gas) nothing at all to do with productivity or innovation of the people, companies or government
5384 2018-06-11 13:43:07 my room is so cold that the coconut oil i put on my brows to try and keep them in place is solid and now i just hear a soft crack every time i move my face uhhhh
5385 2018-06-11 13:42:44 I'm just me. But as you seem to get everything wrong and seem to want to take a negative position about Pete and as I have met him and know how honest he is I am blocking you.
5386 2018-06-11 13:42:42 Waking up to a sense of peace and the Universe's goodness = pure bliss! Time to figure out an essential oil blend for today. It is definitely a Sweet Orange and Lemongrass type of morning. Wishing everyone a beautiful week 
5387 2018-06-11 13:42:36 You are throwing the American farmers under the bus. Big oil, real estate and wealthy money market investors are the only winners with your self serving policies.

5391 2018-06-11 13:41:50 Never rubbing lotion again, oil all the way
5392 2018-06-11 13:41:50 Sure, but . .
1) Where’s rUK going to put Trident?
2) Where’s rUK going to get its oil?
3) Where’s rUK going to get its electricity?
4) Where’s rUK going to get its drinking water?
6) How’s rUK going to pay for ‘national infrastructure’ costs without Scotland’s 9% contribution?
5393 2018-06-11 13:41:38 Various rumours and states of readiness in the oil crescent for potential military action.

Hard to tell if this will materialise but regardless the bulk of the Libyan public will be against any action that threatens the oil infrastructure.

5399 2018-06-11 13:40:42 OK, but oil tankers hold a finite supply. With the water level being what it is, there's no way to replenish their supply when the tanker's empty.

5407 2018-06-11 13:40:04 #gbp they also have the farm in wildcard and Italian license news that could land at any time thrown into the mix. The risk reward is fantastic at these levels given the huge CPR numbers, if Namibia proves to be a new oil frontier then gbp are in for quite a ride
5408 2018-06-11 13:39:44 Jojoba oil or almond oil
5409 2018-06-11 13:39:40 Omg lol my mom gets some from my neighbors. I used to use aloe Vera and then coconut oil but now I have my own skin care bottles. But would it be bad if I were to still use aloe Vera and coconut oil. Kinda like combine all of them?
5410 2018-06-11 13:39:38 Like real weed gives me anxiety but wax and fire oil calms me.
5411 2018-06-11 13:39:30 Similar amount to the orders from Saudi Arabia for US goods last year when President Trump went to meet his new friend which acted as the catalyst in driving oil prices sharply higher. @TheBubbleBubble @Yogi_Chan @russelljones25
5412 2018-06-11 13:39:21 Well, it's made at my restaurant with my instructions on the amount of oil ;) helping me tone up well. What else could I ask for!

People want something that fixes their problem while also being able to get high. The thc doesn't harm, but it could have your kid taken in illegal states
5422 2018-06-11 13:37:53 とっても楽しみ((o(｡>ω<｡)o))
5423 2018-06-11 13:37:52 Yeah they're really good. And try their szechuan wontons (red oil dumplings). Also delicious
5424 2018-06-11 13:37:52 You want to "nickle and dime" the game? Hit the Saudi's with a tariff on oil,  that's plugging away on the stock market. You and your comrades in the Kremlin and Saudi prepare for ARAMCO. Your a #Predator. I hate dirty crooks. And your an agent of an enemy state (P19).
5425 2018-06-11 13:37:43 The 'Christopher Columbus' approach is very worrying. In Zim we have folks young and old trying to make the best out of a very bleak situation.But the snake oil salesmen cum strategists in Zanu would like to portrary Zim as open virgin territory up for grabs to the highest bidder
5426 2018-06-11 13:37:30 Don't be daft. Sweden had no idea then about Norway's huge oil reserves.

5437 2018-06-11 13:36:52 @JustinTrudeau needs to take a deep breath, and look at what his nation has on the line. We are 3/4s of their exports-we move oil/gas to our respective coasts.

NAFTA was supposed to HELP-but as Perot said: "The giant sucking sound" has become a giant sucking wound for the US.
5438 2018-06-11 13:36:48 อ้วนนะอย่ากินหลังสองทุ่ม
5439 2018-06-11 13:36:33 Canada needs to import more cheese/food products from ...... Europe. Needs to export more oil to .... China.
5440 2018-06-11 13:36:17 Undoubtedly, executives of oil PSUs— IOCL, ONGC and OIL— behave like feudal lords... most of them exploit dealers... but, Pvt oilcos have their own negative points
5441 2018-06-11 13:36:12 So you are of the opinion that "fair trade" is 
1) US puts tariffs on Canadian goods exports to US - like oil, and 
2) Canada puts tariffs on US exports to Canada - like Canadians traveling to US. Tax them so the CA services deficit with US goes to zero too.
Makes sense!

5443 2018-06-11 13:36:06 Usually, the more recognized they are in their field, the more credible. A lot of these unknown ‘experts’ are just snake oil salesmen for hire. And yes some of the experts on both sides of the aisle in police shootings have been suspect.
5444 2018-06-11 13:36:01 I did a hot oil treatment after washing it on Saturday, plaited it then undid this morning and put some shea butter on it

5446 2018-06-11 13:35:43 I thought Weald oilers was Tony, Pete and Adrian.
I only asked a question as to when a picture was actually taken.
You seem very sensitive to a simple question.
5447 2018-06-11 13:35:39 My college grad just got a job paying $100k base $100k bonus. Work hard , don’t get in trouble and get a job in booming field (oil) and the world is yours.
5448 2018-06-11 13:35:35 #gbp scaled back in here on Friday completing today for around 1m shares. The excitement will build as wells are drilled in Namibia this year and a sniff of oil on any of those drills will bring gbp firmly into play, huge CPR numbers and cashed up to ride the drilling season
5449 2018-06-11 13:35:15 This Weeks Specials: 25% off Northern Lights Blue THC Activated Tincture and 20% off all Rick Simpson Oil (RSO).
5450 2018-06-11 13:35:12 I think it's worth noting that United States' #1 source of foreign oil imports - 40% in 2017 - is Canada. And from North Korea we get....
5451 2018-06-11 13:35:11 And since the BP oil spill and others before it, we know the sea can catch on fire... so, let's just be real... she should have linked the two concepts by then

5457 2018-06-11 13:34:17 Since my day started on the wrong foot I had to do something to balance it so I took my car for an oil change and wash
5458 2018-06-11 13:34:03 You cannot condemn the use of an oil, water, mantles, prophetic directions and signs, tokens and symbols just because you are speaking on the name of Jesus. God works with principles and His kingdom is principled based. Research the scripture correctly.

5467 2018-06-11 13:33:17 I’ve applied so much deep heat, arnica oil, strapping but my legs are still sore. I’m literally shuffling around. Is this what I deserve for running #ComradesMarathon2018 with only 640km (including races) clocked this year 
5468 2018-06-11 13:33:08 I use:
-Cetaphil (everyday)
-Tea tree pads (like 2-4 times a week)
-St. Ives Apricot Face Scrub (like 2 times a week)
-Sunscreen!! & Vitamin E oil (everyday)
-And a very expensive dermatologist to prescribe Epiduo lmao (every other step is useless to me without this one)

5473 2018-06-11 13:31:40 Ready for a wild conspiracy theory? Russian wants the arctic  oil fields and trump wants Canadian water.  but seriously, I think trump is jealous of Trudeau. That, and ivanka is under Canadian investigation.

5476 2018-06-11 13:30:39 #OrderBook Welspun Corp Limited have been awarded contract for supply of @ 33 KMT of Pipes for Oil & Gas project in to the America's market. With this addition, the Company's current order book stands at @ 1,643 KMTs valued at @ INR 114 billion.
5477 2018-06-11 13:30:34 Dictator Trump surrounded himself with morons and moneymen. Devoss, the neurosurgeon working for urban development, Pai who is working for telecommunications, Tillerson, for the oil industry. Not one idea between any of these losers to benefit the middle class.

5478 2018-06-11 13:30:12 She's right! Lol use coconut or Olive oil as the base and drop tea tree in it, use it until the pimple dries up completely

5483 2018-06-11 13:29:48 Hi Holly. The SLS we use is made from Coconut Oil and Rapeseed Oils. We work closely with the supplier to ensure no Palm is used in the production of this 1/2
5484 2018-06-11 13:29:42 These complaints all sound like local government issues. Excluding the price of oil barrels for gasoline.
5485 2018-06-11 13:29:31 LOL
Canadian are over leveraged on both the public & private level. Their real estate is more inflated than the US in 2008, their consumers have little net worth & the only thing keeping them going is the higher oil prices.

They have no leverage. None.
5486 2018-06-11 13:29:24 A lot of guys wrong about crude oil # sub USD 50/45 WTI next few months IMHO
5487 2018-06-11 13:29:23 Though I have received my “Redneck Jew” seal of approval from hicks and hayseeds everywhere. I put it on the back window of my pickup truck next to my NRA Life Member decal. I love that truck.

5495 2018-06-11 13:28:37 It is NOT the law, CBD Oil is legal in the UK. She is not carrying a drug, she is carrying a food supplement. The oil was prescribed by her GP. Get your facts right!

5499 2018-06-11 13:28:19 I realize there are so many "breaking stories" these days. But, you have to encourage your friends in the MSM to cover more stories like this. Also, the selling off of our natural wonders to the highest bidders in gas and oil. #Deplorable
5500 2018-06-11 13:27:56 We do have some terrible roads in the Tampa Bay. Pot holes, random sinkholes, and the oil slicks on the road after a rain storm. I’ve quit counting how many times I’ve hydroplaned doing the speed limit.
5501 2018-06-11 13:27:44 OK. What if it's imposed by nature ? Oil doesn't flow because we wish it.
#PeakOil
5502 2018-06-11 13:27:44 Interesting. However, torrefaction itself must consume energy + neither this article nor MN biomass article linked within addressed this. If biocoal was burned to make biocoal, how much more would be produced than consumed? Similar Q w ethanol, oil in fertilizer/power to produce.
5503 2018-06-11 13:27:39 You also spend far more on illegal Warefare which no one wants , usually to gain oil, ye you don’t cut back on that do you ? Hypocrite !
5504 2018-06-11 13:27:37 Are you that uneducated? Obama increased oil exports today the highest level in history but facts don’t interest you do never mind run along

5511 2018-06-11 13:26:48 Another thing to put into consideration is the fuel that most of the people is blabbering about, the declining economy of U.S plus the increase of the price of the oil in Middle East countries is the greatest factor why there is the so called increase of prices.
5512 2018-06-11 13:26:44 concerts are cool, till i remember I have an anxiety disorder thats going to make it miserable. oh well already paid for to see my favorite person #logic #bt2 @Logic301 I just gotta whip out my cbd oil n hope for the best dawg. shit mane.

5514 2018-06-11 13:26:15 You should really try CBD oil! Im sure you may already know that it has 0 thc in it and will not get you high but it works absolute wonders for anxiety!
5515 2018-06-11 13:26:12 Oil prices eased today, pulled down by rising Russian production and the highest US drilling activity in more than three years but supported by concerns over future Iranian and Venezuelan output.
5516 2018-06-11 13:25:59 When price of crude oil is decreasing why petrol and diesel prices go up.?

5527 2018-06-11 13:25:00 Something I am going to more aware of this year is palm oil in products. If I check a label and it says palm oil I deliberately do put things back however I often don't check labels of products I know and use often. I will be looking into palm oil free alternatives too! #palmoil
5528 2018-06-11 13:24:55 Like it or not, Russia is a major economy in Europe. Russia exports roughly 11% of the worlds' oil, with quite a lot of it going to European Union nations.

5537 2018-06-11 13:24:12 Hence why we do not use palm oil or palm oil derived ingredients in our #Calmmé cream.

5540 2018-06-11 13:23:54 Canada is a resource based economy. Lumber oil gas very little manufacturing outside automotive. Which is an integrated system. So. Your note about electronics seems very dubious. As we buy all our finished goods from the US

5552 2018-06-11 13:23:10 That I understand. Not why we don’t have oil reserves but that our short sighted Governments allow us to be treated like puppets. We should have been filling Nullarbor caves with it like the USA were doing themselves. But still don’t understand why it is not averaged through week

5565 2018-06-11 13:21:40 He is a great prospect, but sorry not for a number 10 pick.  If Oil are locked into taking him and not considering who may slip to them (like Barzal did!)at 10 its a big mistake
5566 2018-06-11 13:21:33 Sometimes no. Dr. Orrin Devinsky has also recently put out his research about cannabis oil and treatment for epilepsy and for many neurological disorders. I can’t really explain it in a short reply. Maybe the issue is getting 6 months worth of it but it’s still medication.
5567 2018-06-11 13:21:22 1. In 1993, Tony Blair contributed his favourite recipe (fettuccine with olive oil, sundried tomatoes and capers) to the Islington Cookbook. Cynics maintain that despite his subsequent conversion to fish and chips, his love of olive oil remains as strong as ever.

5587 2018-06-11 13:18:21 5% too much. I hear you on the palm oil though. I guess we all do what we can in different ways

5600 2018-06-11 13:16:59 Yung oil pastel kong napakamahal di ko pa nagagamit as in. Sana di masira to. Huhuhu. After boards ko pa balak magbalik loob sa original medium ko.
5601 2018-06-11 13:16:52 That's the whole point...The president does not have an effect on the fuel prices for the most part. It is all about Supply/Demand. OPEC controls the prices. WE need to become less dependent on other countries oil and use ours.
5602 2018-06-11 13:16:49 If it weren’t for Darrell reminding me to get oil changes and other maintenance on my Jeep, I’d probably be walking 
5603 2018-06-11 13:16:47 Dont forget we just bought a pipeline with nobody to sell the oil to now.

5604 2018-06-11 13:15:55 I would agree on second part ex would be music, international sports, cuisines, illness research, sustainable power generations, different cultures' way of life, and lot of stuffs I haven't mention,  and the third one, ending war over commodities such as oil.
5605 2018-06-11 13:15:40 What a snake oil salesman! If he's talking, he's lying!
5606 2018-06-11 13:15:36 You make the key point. A bit of a straw man to say energy security has been only about oil before. There’s nothing new about rightly recognizing national security imperative of electricity reliability. What’s new are the spurious grounds  to subsidize “fuel-secure” generation
5607 2018-06-11 13:15:28 Girl i did the same thing. Use coconut oil every night before bed they will come back. Mine did and they look better then before. Also vaseline works well.

5613 2018-06-11 13:14:45 The biggest incompetence of the union has been ongoing since the mid-60's - the state's handling of North Sea Oil. Another reminder today.

ONE - only ONE - tanker railway car carries in excess of 110,000 litres of oil. 4800 litre spill is unacceptable, lying about it is even worse. But a tanker car would produce a spill 23X larger - & a train may have 100 cars

5745 2018-06-11 12:57:45 Well poor people don't hire anyone. And if Obama didn't block the keystone pipeline there would be a gas surplus instead of a shortage. Which raises the price of oil. And the tax cuts could be permanent if Congress voted to make them so.

5810 2018-06-11 12:50:59 ....because it's bullshit? Because same job, same industry, pay is identical. Men work in STEM more than women. Men take more physically dangerous jobs (oil rigs, etc) that pay more. Men keep crap jobs for the paycheck.
5811 2018-06-11 12:50:53 actually, it was to stop German moves towards Iraqi oil fields and the building of supply lines through the Balkans, but let's not let historical facts cloud the narrative

5824 2018-06-11 12:49:42 Gotcha :) Hence WFPB. Minimal or zero oil. Real non processed food Mostly centered around plants.

You and only you used up excess oil !!!
5833 2018-06-11 12:49:11 I think we have about as many, plus all the 45s  and 78s passed down from my parents!! Hubby has a Mitchell hydraulic reference turntable which I don't understand, apparently it involves oil. Fortunately I have a CD player!!

5836 2018-06-11 12:49:03 Last I checked, oil companies aren't burning the oil. WE ARE. Oil companies merely provide a product WE eagerly use. Do you not understand that Pontiff. Are you suggesting they suddenly cut off the world and send us back to the stone age?
5837 2018-06-11 12:48:47 Lol! It's the bomb, yo!! Chicken breast, vegetable oil, garlic, lemon, salt, pepper and lemon pepper seasoning. It's delicious!
5838 2018-06-11 12:48:36 The pipeline won't hurt you or the environment, it's just a tube that carries oil. But unless you are willing to live like the 1800's, be quiet!!
5839 2018-06-11 12:48:34 Yep, completely agree - we know already the types who'd encourage such a scary situation. The same ones who denied that climate change existed, pro-fracking, creation for more wars to buy & sell more oil & weapons. The list goes on :-(

5995 2018-06-11 12:31:31 If you're going to buy CBD oil make sure it is legit company and that it's actual CBD from hemp there is people out there cooking it and trying to sell it as there's and it's illegal.
5996 2018-06-11 12:31:17 Jobs for all is tall order. People are unemployed for various reasons. US companies are too most in the world, but the job trickle doesn't happen because the jobs go overseas.

5997 2018-06-11 12:31:17 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.
5998 2018-06-11 12:31:13 It truly depends on the cheese. Halloumi is one of those cheeses that’s $10-$12 a unit that you can slap on the grill for a bit, drizzle a little olive oil on and before you know it, you’ve eaten the whole damn thing in one sitting. It’s soo good.

6002 2018-06-11 12:30:39 She went to Canada to get the oil that is a banned substance in the U.K., maybe if she is this determined to obtain the oil maybe she would be best moving to Canada then she wouldn’t have got a criminal record of possession, that will possibly stop you going to Canada again
6003 2018-06-11 12:30:35 Personally I think okay je. Bcs it's their own brand. Bukan rip off ke apa. Cuma keep an eye on the ingredients lah sebab tak silap I ada yang ada collagen & horse oil.
6004 2018-06-11 12:30:33 I believe the oil products are quite different from a lot of the US *airquotes* medical dispensary stuff, which often seems like backdoor legalisation. There may be a case for that but AIUI what's been legalised here has next to no THC in and can't actually get you high.

6008 2018-06-11 12:30:05 Only five percent of rainforest is cleared for beef.  By and large its cleared to claim the land via usufruct laws.  Rainforest in asia is cleared at a higher rate, and much is for palm oil.  You can choose what you will, but death is in everything even if you dont see it.
6009 2018-06-11 12:29:54 What kind of oil? Synthetic/synthetic blend/Conventional?
6010 2018-06-11 12:29:53 @TheEconomist calls the struggle for freedom of the oil rich #Biafra as "banditry"...
Over 3.5 million Biafrans were Murdered within 30 months 1967-70 by #Nigerian #Britain and #France . They continues to kill Biafrans to date.
6011 2018-06-11 12:29:44 There must be an alternative to palm oil so the destruction of rain forests stops and for the sake of the orangutan. Solar, wind and wave power must be developed.

6015 2018-06-11 12:29:26 No matter the length of the candle wick of an oil lamp, the flame that it produces always burns with the same luminous intensity and magnificence. 

No one knows how long or short their life will be, which is why you should never pass up any opportunities afforded to you.

I suppose someone has to tell you what to do in your job , but at least have the ***** to stand up to non lying journalism . We fully expect the news that oil only has weeks to go .
6020 2018-06-11 12:29:07 Trump, Brexit, and Marine LePen are all connected, via Russian operatives. I could argue they’ve targeted Germany too, with limited success.

Russia is trying to undermine the EU/NATO and liberal democracies. B/C sanctions work against single-industry (i.e. oil&gas) economies.

6031 2018-06-11 12:28:10 Oh, knock it off... what you're REALLY doing is working to shift the balance of power away from Europe, and onto the oil/ gas/ coal barons of Russia, China, and the USA. But it won't work that way. You'll get WAR. Europe will be an ash heap, so will SA.
6032 2018-06-11 12:28:02 He chuckled and pulled her in closer. "Oh yeah, I'm really romantic. You gotta see what I got planned for later tonight." He brought his lips to her ear. "Two words baby; massage oil." He nipped her ear gently and chuckled.
6033 2018-06-11 12:27:59 Well, today the equivalent of "food" is oil.  Through our farming practices we eat oil, one step removed, so this is a fair lens to look through.
When an empire cannot sustain its internal energy flows, that's the beginning of the end.

6046 2018-06-11 12:26:15 if any one of the Tory MPs had kids that had the same illness and required the same oil, you can bet the govt wouldve acted quickly and passed a law to allow such medicines to be used in such circumstance.

6057 2018-06-11 12:24:28 Let us take our time to explore other cultures. I had a full bowl of Prementaw - a delicious Jago food with white rice and sizzled in palm oil. My friends and I would take turn passing the jumbo around and we dipped our hands in the same bowl. Truly, we are equal.
6058 2018-06-11 12:24:24 Happy birthday — here’s an oil change and emissions test. Oh you also need a $60 air filter and two new taillights. 
6059 2018-06-11 12:24:22 Hopefully my mother be nice enough to get my oil change after she take me to the airport
6060 2018-06-11 12:23:53 And then a tweep will come with that "Ask your girl where she was last Saturday between 1&4" and your heart will sink in oil
6061 2018-06-11 12:23:48 honestly though that sort of thing seems plausible when ar/holograms are possible. I can see some snake oil business man being like "y'gotta put our holo lights on your pool table. Our data indicates that you get a 200% engagement rates from the simple addition of holo lights."

They want us to consume & they demonize those of us who question the health/sanity of it as wimps or un-American. They hide the truth. We can & should do much better.

6074 2018-06-11 12:22:22 Having worked in airport security for many years I can understand why this has taken place. ..having said that if any oil or other  liquid has been prescribed by a doctor for this medical reason then a doctors letter is all that's required. The passenger may then proceed.
6075 2018-06-11 12:22:22 Fox is a puppets of the Mexican plutocrats. Mexico has the 17th largest economy with significant oil revenues. It spends peanuts on social programs while depending on remittances to calm the deprived masses

6128 2018-06-11 12:15:18 Oil "Tear of the Buddha" is an effective remedy for acne. The oil forms a film that blocks the ingress of oxygen into the inflammation zone. Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil, for three days, dramatically reduce the size of acne.
6129 2018-06-11 12:15:13 EXACTLY!!!!! A good example is fried chicken. Certainly you can use Lawry's but not by itself. Brine the chicken, flavor the cooking oil, and the manner of frying is important too.

6271 2018-06-11 11:57:18 How about you stop speaking through both sides of your mouth? Your "concern" for small islands means nothing when you are a poster boy for oil pipelines!

6279 2018-06-11 11:56:27 And in my opinion the only reason USA,EU and UK have been unable to freely endorse Israel in taking the whole country for oil.

6284 2018-06-11 11:55:45 Demo was very much required . It was not certain that GST would be passed by all and thus to increase tax base for public spending in the face of dynamic oil prices would have harmed public expenditure . But more than that it helped banks who had no money to lend given high NPAs.
6285 2018-06-11 11:55:43 Don’t ever stop with the baby oil! We women need it! HAHA 
6286 2018-06-11 11:55:37 Hey, Donny: 
Maybe Canada should keep its oil and refine it themselves. You won’t tariff that. You need it too much. But given your predecessors inclinations, you’ll invent a threat and invade your most loyal trading partner. That’s what you do.

6291 2018-06-11 11:55:18 You should use coconut oil for the dryness. Not a lot to look greasy. S little goes a long way

6298 2018-06-11 11:54:26 too simplistic. The Sauds (oil money) hate Hizbullah, and so do very many British Muslims, who know what Hizbullah is doing to Syrian Muslim civilians.

6303 2018-06-11 11:54:03 It was the same way when I was an auto mechanic.
"Hey could you change my oil real quick?"
Then the thing wouldn't start or there'd be some other issue that "just started".
And they'd be like "What do you mean I have to buy parts?"

6318 2018-06-11 11:52:56 I just can’t believe folks actually believe this shit. I’m with you CB, Clif had his webbot(at times I was still unsure of), but these folks got nothing but snake oil. #beware

6321 2018-06-11 11:52:47 Oh yea, regulations that made our water- air clean. Regulations that made it illegal to shoot sleeping bears and their cubs. Regulations that helped curtain oil spills....  that’s just a few. The booming economy has been booming for years.  Manufacturing companies leaving ..
6322 2018-06-11 11:52:44 We have the highest standard of living because of the oil,gas and mineral wealth that was pillaged from colonial rules in Africa ,Middle East and Asia. We are still benefiting today. The west is wealthy because they rely on Arab,Chinese,Asian,Russian investment.

6415 2018-06-11 11:38:47 Something everyone should keep in mind. 40% of imported oil refined in the US comes from Canada. And 60 terawatthours (TWh) of power are imported from Canada. Think brownouts and gas lines if trump cuts trade.

6417 2018-06-11 11:38:44 I had a big ass bump on my nose ring & it went down in like 3 days from using that oil every morning & night .
6418 2018-06-11 11:38:38 Scots don't need oil Simon,its a bonus. two questions for you
1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% or our resources or the 8% we get from Westminster?
2) Do you think scots are wrong for wanting to run their own country?
Brave man to answer those honestly !
6419 2018-06-11 11:38:25 Buhari signed regional pipelines deal in  Morocco.  So my crude oil will  be taken  from Nigeria to thousands of miles away to  satisfy d lords of Arabs ? .

6422 2018-06-11 11:37:36 9 million US jobs depend on exports to Canada. 
America buys $53b of Canadian oil(25% of your imports) to run your gulf coast cokers. 
You still need us, unless those refining jobs mean nothing to La/Tx.

6425 2018-06-11 11:37:24 You are right. But oil is the MIGHTY ingredient in our foods and we must have deep fried snacks at many intervals. Palmoil is killing the forests of Borneo and eradicating orang outans. Sesame oil is the best but cold pressed ones #sad

6466 2018-06-11 11:29:43 The insular, ill-advised, isolationist decision to sanction Iran is one factor. 

But that’s just one of trump’s policies that hurts American workers first. 

Gas prices are based on tensions around oil supply and demand. We import oil from Canada more than any other country.

6845 2018-06-11 10:34:09 i can confirm that Iraq doesn't own that vessel and that likely on time charter or bareboat charter. I suspect the former, not the latter as too much risk. my money on time chartering a vessel already on time charter to oil major. anybody else out there know for sure?
6846 2018-06-11 10:34:06 Canada has been running trade deficits with the US over the pass few years.  In fact, most of the years they ran huge surpluses were for oil sold to the US.  Canada is a very small market and selling the over supply dairy farmers produce in Canada would not solve their problems.

6857 2018-06-11 10:32:31 There might be an end to what EU buys from USA, thanks to Trump. EU has close ties to the east. Oil is bought from Russia via a third party and gas is bought directly from Russia. It will increase with Nord Stream 2.
6858 2018-06-11 10:32:20 I would of thought it would be in the interest financially for russia for us to stay in seeing as a lot of our gas and oil come from russia via the e.u. if anybody is to blame it's the undemocratic e.u.

6886 2018-06-11 10:26:24 Out of all the plant oils, palm oil has by far the highest yield out of any of them (more than double most other oils). So takes up less land to produce the same amount. Certainly not perfect (like most food production) - ask companies about sustainable sourcing.

6918 2018-06-11 10:17:29 That makes sense. But I wonder if it is partly in response to the potential that in the (admittedly quite distant) future there may not be a reliance on oil at all? E.g. EVs, RE, and other innovations.

7202 2018-06-11 09:26:16 But it depends if you make more profit leaving the asset stranded or not. But oil demand won’t fall off a cliff even if it hits peak demand. The question then becomes do you invest in more assets or not.

7207 2018-06-11 09:24:16 Hi Ryan, Thanks for your question, no palm oil is used in our tortilla chips.
7208 2018-06-11 09:24:12 Canada’s trade in oil(which US needs) is about $53b. So if POTUS wants us to reduce the goods surplus, look no further than energy.
7209 2018-06-11 09:23:27 Did you add the tomatoes, olive oil and basil?
7210 2018-06-11 09:23:15 Sad but true, it's a flawed business model being obliged to sell everything for a pound. If your costs go up (e.g. due to weak pound, price of oil, or suppliers' demands), your margin goes down. Poundland manage to avoid this by selling things for other than a pound. #poundworld

The classic is stale bread (when bread was good, stale was merely another state for different use), tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, oil. Can vary --
7461 2018-06-11 08:26:26 You should investigate the use of neem oil, bicarb & apple cider vinegar. There's a few variations of DIY bug repellers that you can use that will also keep things balanced. Neem oil is great for beauty treatments too.

7597 2018-06-11 07:57:25 Do it!! Cleansing too much or with a foaming cleanser can cause stripping of the skins natural oils and moisture, so maybe consider a new cleansing routine! And try not to cleanse more than once or twice a day if you can. Highly recommend an oil or balm cleanser

7685 2018-06-11 07:36:45 I think it is time the rest of the world got together and told the USA top get lost.  Stop trading oil in US dollars and cripple the USA and lets get a new pworld order.
7686 2018-06-11 07:35:59 Ahk! I already use coconut oil in it too. I might attempt an egg free one sometime!

It's the USA that maintains a healthy Trade Surplus with Canada. Plus they control our Domestic Oil Prices
7690 2018-06-11 07:35:30 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
7691 2018-06-11 07:35:11 You made a broad statement and included a specific graphic which doesn't even support your argument that Canada is somehow a bad trading partner with the USA. Are we to mind read what you are trying to say?

PS: OIL is our largest export to the US. Want less?
7692 2018-06-11 07:35:07 U cant mix water&oil, gift w/works, grace w/works, Saviorhood w/Lordship, 1 step w/3 steps-it just doesnt work that way, excepting that Gods powerful convictrion overcomes their false teaching cause they say enuf truthful gospel info that He can still work around em-YB a barrier?

7694 2018-06-11 07:34:22 Saudi Arabia just found an offshore source that could supply the entire world for another 80 years. As for mining practices for lithium... lol, hardly clean. Odds are with the unexplored places of the world, it's likely we can find enough oil for the next 500 years. Yer problem?
7695 2018-06-11 07:34:16 A lot of people saying IP/Info is the new Oil. 

Not it's not, oil is harder to steal and comes at a much bigger price when attempting to steal it.
7696 2018-06-11 07:33:35 Parliament should be in West Wales some call it Borderland Government in Scotland, before pigs blow anything else up There is security there they would never find the Press war again The Red Sea used to be a nice area where people dived Oil of gladness passed Conservation reigned

7701 2018-06-11 07:31:47 Or don’t sell it at all. The oil needs to stay in the ground because climate change. Water I’m open to on humanitarian grounds, but Canada needs to focus on not being a mere resource extractor, not seeing our ecology as just an economic resource to be plundered.

7706 2018-06-11 07:30:50 いいなーしかない
7707 2018-06-11 07:30:24 Sure. USA want to be the Leader of the Free World, with hands on worldwide oil ressources and interfering everywhere where it's wanted - or not.

There ain't such thing as a free lunch - you want to be a Superpower, we don't.

7721 2018-06-11 07:27:08 Only Modi is responsible If petrol price increases. Falling price of crude oil is responsible for decreasing price. That's the readymade answer.
7722 2018-06-11 07:27:05 Olive oil has no place with meat,  it's for salads and bread.  Olive oils low smoke point means it's just not suitable

7940 2018-06-11 06:39:57 #Petrol Price : ₹79.48 (-0.21)
#Diesel Price : ₹71.73 (-0.16)

Crude oil prices stands in almost same rate... Needs to reduce the State and Central taxes...
7941 2018-06-11 06:39:55 And I'm shutting up now.  

I make my own conclusions.

The past is irrelevant, there is no pattern that repeats.  Only the future that extends.

I hope I'm wrong.  I'm pretty sure we're screwed, as in the average American consumer.  The oil companies are just fine.  Lol

7943 2018-06-11 06:39:33 So you expect people to be appalled we’re exporting oil? More supply should make prices go down, don’t you think?

7949 2018-06-11 06:37:25 Not all trade is in goods. If you are going to tariff something tariff oil. Then see how long you are president. If you do this then you can’t sell the refined product back at a profit & you lose. See how that works? You are stupid and your aides are worse for not doing research.
7950 2018-06-11 06:37:21 “I said it is on record and I challenge anybody to check from Europe, United States and Asia that between 1999 and 2014, the 16 years of previous administration, there was an average of 2.1 million per day of crude oil at the average cost of 100 dollars per barrel,” 
7951 2018-06-11 06:37:17 There ain't such thing as a free lunch: you want to be leader of the free world, dominating superpower with hands on worldwide oil resources. 

But, we didn't realise USA has now 3. world status - we are immigrant friendly!

7958 2018-06-11 06:35:12 The citizens of Oceania in 1984 have to master the art of double-think, allowing them to hold contradictory beliefs such as "2+2=4, except when it =5". A good example would be "oil and gas are bad for the environment, except when they're NZ oil & gas & good for the environment".

7969 2018-06-11 06:32:08 if you're a data scientist at google - you set your pay.  if you're a checkout clerk, you don't.  Oil is a commodity so what is the incremental cost per barrel.  I would argue it's not the $15 - 20 quoted for GCCs but their budgetary constraints which are a lot higher.

Early post WW2 wars were to stop Soviet expansion (not very well..) and the anti-terror “wars” have been mostly USA pushed narratives that we dragged our allies to protect oil interests.

Russia & China are no friend of our (flawed) democracies.

8078 2018-06-11 06:07:33 Ah, gotcha. Main thing to watch for is oil level, it won't start if the oil is low. The glow plugs are pretty easy to replace on there too with some patience. I'm about to start doing some tasteful mods to mine.
8079 2018-06-11 06:06:48 I pakai yg ni, sgt sesuai dgn my skin. I pakai simple tak sesuai. And yg paling bagus i try Banila Co tp beli online. Bukan cleansing oil tp cleansing balm.

8081 2018-06-11 06:06:19 When Cdn economist & author Jeff Rubin wrote about the end of globalization due to peak oil & skyrocketing oil prices, he talked about what veggies he remembers being available in Canada when he was a kid. When he said it, I remembered too.  We've been self sufficient before.

8087 2018-06-11 06:05:11 Just all part of the narrative his surrogates are spinning. He’s weak. He’s a betrayer. He’s a backstabber. He won’t say things to your face. One of those times you wish you could just say to hell with it and shut off the oil pipelines for a year and see how it shakes out.

8092 2018-06-11 06:04:26 The salad part is good, but the lack of fat, hopefully healthy fat and not hydrogenated, is misguided. The salad itself is probably very low calorie, and most people do not follow extreme lo-cal diet. Meaning, rather than healthy veggie oil, you’ll get calories somewhere else.

8106 2018-06-11 06:01:26 When you slip into a recession & major source of income (Oil) drops to the lowest, you must borrow to stay alive and most importantly to fund capital projects, which is unlike the past when we were borrowing for salaries. 

That money remitted might be enough for just 1 project.

8216 2018-06-11 05:39:09 Just to clarify, you do actually respond to comments. I’d love to hear about how you’d doing something about the raw sewage being dumped our oceans and your plans to travel to other countries to protest their oil and gas.

8223 2018-06-11 05:37:38 If carbon capture technology can store fossil plant emissions beneath the ground, then coal, oil and natural gas plants should continue to operate until the alternative energy infrastructure buildout has been completed.
8224 2018-06-11 05:37:07 The fact that there’s a fresh beef burger that isn’t Maccas for $2 and is yummy is a really good deal. And the combo for it is definitely a grab. It’s what I had a lot first year college bc $2-4 for a full meal that didn’t make me feel sick from oil is amazing

8236 2018-06-11 05:33:10 While still continuing his legacy of neglecting his responsibilties towards Sabah/Sarawak... the country than churns oil and gas for the nation. What a farce!
8237 2018-06-11 05:33:09   NDA Govt had advantage of low oil prices & d fiscal space to rely on stepped up public expenditure as strategy for infra investments & consequent economic pump-priming. Now with oil prices where they are, time to shift gears to PPP again. Start with Kelkar Comm Report.

8252 2018-06-11 05:30:56 - Do not always wash your hair. Wash hair twice a week.
- Always use hair oil. It's to stay shining.
- Do not always tie hair. It will cause the hair to not go straight.
- Avoid wearing shampoo that has 2 in 1. It is better to use different shampoo.

8254 2018-06-11 05:30:42 Tanker traffic in Haro Strait would increase a huge amount, and the area has already proven to not be very well prepared for any sort of oil spill issue with the existing tanker traffic. More tankers only increases the risk.

8256 2018-06-11 05:29:57 The problem being the west cannot survive without the oil and gas and the mineral wealth from the Middle East ,Asia and Africa which has been raped and cleansed for over 200 years .They are now the fastest growing economies in the world. Fancy a job foreigner?
8257 2018-06-11 05:29:35 Don't experiment much else will end up with no hair. Permanent solution.

8279 2018-06-11 05:25:42 This pipeline was proven to be risky enough the private builder gave up, and now the government of Canada is buying it to complete it.
It would carry tar sands oil, which is has a number of environmental as well as First Nations lands rights issues.

8283 2018-06-11 05:24:20 Do you peel your shellac off or get it properly removed? Another big tip is use a cuticle oil frequently. ( I’m a licensed nail technician )

8288 2018-06-11 05:23:45 QOTD : "I have always found that the major essential oils are olive, canola and sesame though some heretics include sunflower oil."
8289 2018-06-11 05:23:43 Oil prices were mixed caught between the downward pull of rising Russian production and U.S. oil drilling activity at its highest since 2015, and upward pressure from strong demand, especially in Asia.
8290 2018-06-11 05:23:26 Why’s it just an open cardboard box

8305 2018-06-11 05:19:44 Is Canada still the breadbasket of the world? I thought that the title went out the door, when AB shifted to an oil based economy. Your children didn't pay any extra price, it's society as a whole which covers for everyone. I pay school taxes each year, but don't have children.
8306 2018-06-11 05:19:40 I cant even argue with you on that. He should have stuck to baby oil...or started stripping.

8310 2018-06-11 05:18:45 Nah, fuck that. Stay away from modern medicine as a whole. Stay away from the ER, and don’t bother calling 911 when someone in your family is dying. Rub some oil on it and leave that bed open for someone more deserving, since you know more than medical professionals.
8311 2018-06-11 05:18:25 Was Kinder Morgan fined? Will they face fines if they knowingly misled the public about the size of the spill? More importantly, how can one trust oil companies or the regulator if they are simply allowed to do this?
8312 2018-06-11 05:18:21 Not at all. America has a strong national interest in securing the supply of oil from the Gulf. That means a strong Saudi Arabia, safe from Iranian proxies who seek to set the region ablaze. Couldn't be more wrong here, Steve.
8313 2018-06-11 05:17:56 This is better than baby oil

We have been lied to for decades now and it's time to wake up.
8316 2018-06-11 05:17:30 This guy has no clue that Tariffs are taxes and that a Trade deficit has nothing to do with profitability to a country - just because you have a trade deficit does not mean your not gaining advantages in other places in your economy ...like oil being traded cheaply for say food

8344 2018-06-11 05:12:23 Don’t expect snake oil salesman trump to know anything about history. Hell, he just said Canadians burned down the White House and thought Frederick Douglass was alive last year. He only knows the art of the con.
8345 2018-06-11 05:12:21 He is looking for proprioception by touching you alongside anxiety of being alone. Good idea would be ipad faced away and blue light turned off with a meditation on. Weighted blanket or wheat bag to hold add 1 drop Lavender oil

8354 2018-06-11 05:11:09 Yeah, Trudeau is a lovely marketing face, for a party that's as corrupt and only barely better then the one they replaced. Pushing oil lines, suing natives, arresting protestors, ignoring housing/utility crises.
8355 2018-06-11 05:10:56 Nope, added coconut powder, oil, vegetables and all that, can out pretty good I must say

8380 2018-06-11 05:05:47 Camada foolishly focused on #bitumen, not light oil or gas.
8381 2018-06-11 05:05:27 Imagine taking your car into the dealership for an oil change, but they won’t release it back because they claim it needs $3000 work to be safe. You don’t have the $. Now, imagine that’s a child.

8384 2018-06-11 05:05:14 U.s makes out just fine once everything is counted. You buy our oil and hydro at steep discounts. We dont need to sell to you. In fact our costs would go down if we didn't sell those things to you. It's canadian customers who pay for the u.s discount.

8405 2018-06-11 05:02:54 Yeah the critical control point is the final effluent oil losses. From experience if we can control O&G below 9000ppm at the inlet to the reactors, it should be fine. Operators shouldn't be allowed to simply modify things. Because it's a biological process and it's sensitive.
8406 2018-06-11 05:02:47 I have zero hope for America being able to be fixed luckily our relationship with Europe should improve they will love our oil and lumber.

8420 2018-06-11 05:01:01 Canada is our largest supplier of oil. Trump threatens to raise tariffs on Canada so that Trudeau raises tariffs on oil to US. Putin's largest export product is oil. Putin gains oil market share. Putin wins.
8421 2018-06-11 05:00:41 this may be the best, bizarre/inappropriate/possibly predatory solicitation to submit my work I've gotten: the title is "Technological Innovation in the Olive Oil Production Chain"

8434 2018-06-11 04:59:26 but back then the peak oil narrative was helpful for terminal value creation. doubt that will be the case now given that investors are unlikely to buy into that kind of a peak oil thesis again.

8442 2018-06-11 04:58:27 Just as a phone company would not be allowed to cut cables in an area of this or that party, nor an oil company cut gas supply to get to the polls, so actions such as slowing the speed of service aiming at electoral effects must be proscribed.

8447 2018-06-11 04:57:54 One option to tackle that is by having a buffer pond/tank by temporary storing fresh POME and skimming off excess oil/grease before pumping them into the reactors.

8452 2018-06-11 04:57:25 They both have! Talk is better then war but it's mixing oil with water they don't. 
Each ones demands not even comparable to a compromise. Trump can not be trusted and changes his mind and even the US, they broke the Iran deal just because he did not like it!

8456 2018-06-11 04:56:59 Yes, local elevators buy them, local crush plants bid them. These are oil sunflowers, grown for their oil, destined for crush.
8457 2018-06-11 04:56:54 U.s buys oil at steep discount and resell for profit. Well now we have our own refineries being built AND our oil is going to markets. We dont need usa. We have your hydro though.Which you also pay steep discount for...open the can and grab a fork.Them are worms you are gonna eat
8458 2018-06-11 04:56:46 If it was just a trade, why Indian Govt took efforts and continued with Iran oil when pressure was immense. Port deal continued even under sanctions. It’s not just oil and economics. It’s much more...

Bad news for you America, we are building our own refineries and getting oil to markets. We won't need you. But you still need our hydro-which you also pay steep discount for.
8475 2018-06-11 04:53:47 Yeah. @DanielLMcAdams is the worst kind of snake oil salesman. Groveling to white supremacist Trump about how "proud" he is of him. Barf.

8494 2018-06-11 04:49:24 Look at the energy mix evolution from mid-70s. Lessening dependency on imported oil for baseload power generation cushioned the impact of oil prices on inflation. I think it’s somewhere in there.

8499 2018-06-11 04:48:59 Good talk. I got to finally rolled blunt rolled in oil and dipped in Kief waiting for me, So I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree on this because No matter how we end this conversation he’s getting a gold jacket and he earned every piece of fabric and stitch used to make it
8500 2018-06-11 04:48:29 Disagree. Putin is undoubtedly the most powerful man on the planet. The entire Europe is at the mercy of the Russians who can let them freeze in no time by switching off the oil supply. 
Trump a novice in geopolitical chess in which Putin is a masterclass!
8501 2018-06-11 04:48:14 And, 911 was an inside job, the moon landing was staged and Putin never kills journalists who expose his corruption, and last but not least Trump will win the Noble peace prize for finally bring peace to Korea. Can I interest you in some snake oil, it cures everything?
8502 2018-06-11 04:48:07 jangan pakai scrub karena bakal iritasi. buat matengin jerawat selain pakai produk yg ada salicylic acid bisa pakai tea tree/grapeseed oil (kleveru/purivera botanicals/haple). jangan lupa double cleasing (micellar water+facewash), terus toner. pastiin semua produk ga ada alkohol
8503 2018-06-11 04:47:31 At least on the west coast, we are a bit pissed with Trudeau at the moment, spending 4+ billion to buy out a failing oil pipeline... but, even so, that's the more standard kind of corporate-self-serving maneuvers we've unfortunately come to expect from politicians.
8504 2018-06-11 04:47:28 Competency can be build if given enough time and resources put into it. But climate, soil conditions suitable for Oil Palm is God given. So we should leverage on that.
8505 2018-06-11 04:47:25 Isn’t there some preliminary data showing that Mar-a-Lago is sitting over a potential oil reserve or gate to hell. Can’t we send this team there?

8508 2018-06-11 04:46:07 This mousie chuhiya thinks herself as maharani with 1000 camels and 500 oil wells from Saudi Arabia. She doesn't know about Arab Sheikhs who will not spare their donkeys for her dirty mind.

8523 2018-06-11 04:44:36 The Arctic is melting. There's a shit-ton of oil to be harvested there in politically ambiguous geography that Canada shares with Russia. I wonder why Trump's started fucking with Canada now? Hmmmm.
8524 2018-06-11 04:44:33 I guess we should keep buying oil for 60 dollor and selling it to other  Countries for 50% less because that make the U.S winner
8525 2018-06-11 04:44:29 Whatever it is, its far better than anything Canadian made. We should stick to whiskey, hockey, and oil.
8526 2018-06-11 04:44:27 *went to go buy oil today, walked up to the register to pay, look up*

8536 2018-06-11 04:41:52 i was a skeptic about Jamaican castor oil but one whiff of it made me a believer. no way all these black kings use that shit unless it 100% works
8537 2018-06-11 04:41:37 Its both. They're stupid, but they know how to grift. Notice how many sell weird nutritional supplements? They are literally the snake oil salesmen of old. They attract a gullible audience with their right wing bluster, then sell them miracle cures and potions.
8538 2018-06-11 04:41:37 Maybe you're right. Maybe #DonTheCon can snap his fingers and new car plants, steel foundries, oil fields/pipelines, and hydro-electric dams will all magically appear out of thin air and you won't need to buy that stuff. BTW, how long does it take to develop an oil field or dam?
8539 2018-06-11 04:41:37 The CNN videos "George Soros in 80 seconds" and "The Koch Brothers in 80 seconds" have HILARIOUSLY different tones. They paint George as a 'bleeding heart liberal philanthropist' but the Koch brothers as 'evil right wingers' who buy political power with their oil money...

8543 2018-06-11 04:41:01 The gold mine offer is like the Rosneft oil deal for the US.
8544 2018-06-11 04:40:57 Love it thx
8545 2018-06-11 04:40:42 The problem is that no one wants to let the U.S. get bankrupt, since all trade is U$D-centric.

If the Euro would replace the USD as lead & reference currency (i.e. Oil trade), the USD would become basically worthless within days.
8546 2018-06-11 04:40:33 You’re up against oils. Good ol’ Dawn is a very powerful detergent. Give that a go. If the fish oil has sat a long time, break it up w/ a little vegetable oil, then use Dawn.
8547 2018-06-11 04:40:31 GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAM AND STUDIES ADD OIL!!!!! you got this!
8548 2018-06-11 04:40:29 Nothing says common sense free trade negotiations like : "we will stand up to bullies" , "our chief negotiating partner in a nazi" , "we will not hurt our economy with tarriffs, unless we call it a carbon tax" , "we will not build pipelines to sell oil to other countries"

8555 2018-06-11 04:39:45 They are loyal to Big Oil Money...the 1% donor class. Alll that is linked to Russian oil money, linked to Russian Mob Oligarchs directly engaged w Putin. Tho the RU Mob money is legal in Russia, it is not in the USA...investigate these ties, & indict. Dems in 2018 can do this.
8556 2018-06-11 04:39:44 How does the dollar drop if there’s more demand on our oil? Sorry, I must’ve missed that part when they were discussing supply & demand in my business classes...
8557 2018-06-11 04:39:29 Not cliche at all. The Leduc area is oil patch grounds too. Aurora are competing for workforce from that region. Before Alberta economy nose dived, I witnessed businesses including fast food chains that were closing Sundays. No workers to be had. "I can't find any good workers!"

But I am single ready 2 mingle if anyones interested 
8562 2018-06-11 04:37:19 Sorry, should have been clearer. When I said "opportunities for the future", I meant opportunities for Putin, not opportunities for Britain! Maybe Brexit will give him opportunities to sell oil, or buy real estate, or acquire companies, or even to install a puppet government!

8571 2018-06-11 04:35:55 Current oil prices are not in sync with international prices. The Govt is selfish and wants to fill its own kitty at the cost of pressure to common man.

8578 2018-06-11 04:35:16 The author might have actually questioned the Americans about their requirement for a sinking plume. The Sumas is a low-sediment river and spilled oil on the Sumas would float for days as all the recent research makes clear #bcpoli #ableg 2/

8629 2018-06-11 04:26:05 We have always been at the mercy of OPEC. That doesn’t change. OPEC determines global oil prices. Oil is also used for a lot more than fuel, so I don’t expect it’s going anywhere too fast anyway. Plus planes, tankers, trains & trucks, are not even close to alternate fuel sources.

8633 2018-06-11 04:25:39 えぇ……
8634 2018-06-11 04:25:39 Also we need to be mindful that we have palm oil, which directly/indirectly employs some 2 mio people in Msia.

Focus on developing high tech downstream applications for palm oil. Not biofuels. But focus on food technology. We can benefit a lot from the global population boom.

8642 2018-06-11 04:24:57 I wonder why? Somehow there are billions for the oil industry innovations courtesy of taxpayer dollars from the Carbon tax but for citizens? Less funding. Do you have the link?
8643 2018-06-11 04:24:57 Which one oil in Lotion ni pah? HL jugak ke?

8656 2018-06-11 04:22:29 China is moving away from oil to clean energy. In the meantime they will use gas from fields in Eastern Russia. They've built one new gas pipeline (commissioned in January) with another one in the works. Meanwhile they are leading the world in clean energy. Time to #ActOnClimate

8660 2018-06-11 04:22:14 Best grilled cheese sandwiches have about half soft butter and half mayo on the bread for browning. The mayo makes a better maillard reaction than just fat (butter/oil). The same is true of meats and fish. Put a very thin coating of mayo on a steak and then sear. It's science.
8661 2018-06-11 04:22:10 Its ludicrous for the Minister of Finance to claim they have turned around the T&T econony when all that happened was oil prices rose while they did absolutely nothing.
8662 2018-06-11 04:21:55 Absolutely hate the smell of tea tree oil....but it works smh

8668 2018-06-11 04:20:41 So many dim bulbs (to coin a phrase from a special snowflake) complain about oil yet use it every day

8673 2018-06-11 04:20:15 tRump is allowing more oil pipelines everywhere and the Pope just had a meeting with the Oil Executives to talk about other better sources of power and saving our Planet. The Planet does not approve of Drumpf.

8695 2018-06-11 04:18:01 We had to do the same thing. You basically have to cook everything in olive oil and go paleo. There is some bread you can have “Beekman’s” as it’s soy free literally every other type of bread has soy lecithin in it.
8696 2018-06-11 04:18:00 Y’all.... essential oils are like magic. I’ve never been quite sure I believe it. But I took oil of oregano yesterday because this cold just wasn’t budging and legit felt a little better by the end of the day. I did it twice today and feel like this cold is basically gone

No more baby oil!
No, more baby oil!
No more, baby oil!
No more baby, oil!
No! More baby oil!
No! More! Baby oil?
No more! Baby? Oil.
8699 2018-06-11 04:17:37 SOME oils of plant origin are healthy, like olive oil coconut oil. But you need to be very specific. Industrial seed oils are NOT healthy.
8700 2018-06-11 04:17:34 Now that I have read your tweet I can say you have lost your ever lov my mind. 1 Canada sits on the second largest oil deposit 2 you import fresh water into the western states as you don’t have any fresh water left 3 you use Canadian generated electricity down your eastern #crazy

8703 2018-06-11 04:17:18 Trevor, I’m going to step out on a political limb here, but if protecting dairy/eggs from imports w/ tariffs I hear as high as 270%, then isn’t this a bit out of sync w/ the free flow of foreign oil w/o tariffs or carbon tax? I am no expert on dairy/eggs but #IHateDblStandards!

8723 2018-06-11 04:16:02 Our oil is a lower value commodity relative to that in Texas and is much more expensive to extract.

That alone is why Texas has more investment in O&G then Canada, Trudeau has nothing to do with that.

8735 2018-06-11 04:15:09 Guess I assume that both pro-oil and anti-oil are almost always blinkered and only see what they want to see.  Obviously a lot of uses will depend on oil for decades more, but a lot of things could transitioned now. /1

8768 2018-06-11 04:11:49 The whole Bush clan are still friends with the Saudi Royal Family. They had organised getting rid of Saddam for quite awhile to get the oil. Howard was involved heavily because he wanted the benefit of the oil and to further his political ambitions. He was party to the whole scam

Also Vaseline & baby oil is not an actual hydrant.

8783 2018-06-11 04:10:33 Yeah, Charles? You want to "put in line" our friend to the north that is currently supplying 40% of our oil and most of our lumber? And our friend to the south that has a lock on our food supply?
8784 2018-06-11 04:10:22 Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 20 paise and 16 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 84.41 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 72.35, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website.
8785 2018-06-11 04:10:17 I've got no time for people here on Vancouver Island making 100k+ in the oil patch, live in BC with their families, but drive around with Alberta licence plates and don't pay a lick of income tax here.

8794 2018-06-11 04:09:14 Dude. You are probably unaware that we get 40% of our oil from Canada and that we don't really have any trees left in this country but please don't let your personal affinity for Trump stop you from learning about how the world works in 2018.

8798 2018-06-11 04:07:44 I'm not talking about summer increases, the trade abroad is increasing the demand on our (oil) supply and our gas prices will increase to reflect the petrol prices in Europe.  And I think they are at around $8 a gallon now?  Haven't looked in awhile.  And it will do a balance

8825 2018-06-11 04:02:16 Indeed, the Athabaskan oil fields have a nearly pure play for investors - new methods of recovery from the tar are now in hand - this huge resource has enough stored liquids to power both Canada and the USA for a few generations -

8878 2018-06-11 03:53:21 This topic isnt about forecasting. It's about explaining a changed relationship that existed in the past. Somewhere along the way there was a structural break caused by a policy shif adopted post-Marcos which lowered sensitivity of inflation to oil prices.

But each time the tech gets close, opec lowers oil prices, & kills it.

8904 2018-06-11 03:47:32 coconut oil has honestly changed my life
8905 2018-06-11 03:47:31 If we want to reduce our deficits with Canada, it's pretty simple - keep ramping up US production of oil and gas, so we are less reliant on Canadian oil. I think all the rest is pretty much a lot of smoke and mirrors and creating more problems than it's worth. (2)
8906 2018-06-11 03:47:07 100% better. Vegetable oils aren’t actually made from vegetables. They are chemically extracted from seeds, creating unstable & damaging fats. Olive or coconut oil much better choices.

8916 2018-06-11 03:45:22 There are. Maybe not in Pettawawa, though. The oil crash really hurt Alberta, so people are moving back east looking for jobs. In Montréal, there are a lot of jobs in film and entertainment, insurance, and a lot of multinationals are headquartered here.

8918 2018-06-11 03:45:16 I'm minding my own dang business knitting while waiting during this oil change. These needles are 12" long and 5 mm in diameter. Think carefully before busting a wrong move anywhere near me, genius.

8920 2018-06-11 03:45:00 what's going on with Paul Gosar Az and his HJ 46? To lift the ban on Feds oil and mining in them?????
8921 2018-06-11 03:44:55 We are seated on the Golf of Guinea, We are the actual owners of the oil/gas.. We will sign an even better deal with the US in exchange for our freedom from the ongoing repression, carnage & genocide we are getting from French Cameroon vry much supported by the Brits & French.
8922 2018-06-11 03:44:48 Damn sorry girl by partner in crime gets them all the time. Breathing , clearly sage oil or lavender. Sipping wine helps her sometimes
8923 2018-06-11 03:44:43 ..the pizza or whatever the processed food item being sold.  Not that pizza is the healthiest food choice, either.  White GMO flour, gmo soy, canola, or corn oil, cheese from gm fed dairy cows., no whole grains, light on veg.  & kids LOVE pizza.  Oh.  Nearly forgot that wheat /2
8924 2018-06-11 03:44:43 He doesn’t now or will ever give a shit about u if u look hard enough he must have money in all this we’ll  just take away the subsidies on our oil we sell u and boom 5 dollar a gallon gas good for u America
8925 2018-06-11 03:44:37 The Houthis are a threat to Saudi Arabia, which is one of the largest oil producers in the world.
8926 2018-06-11 03:44:28 Twitter was not about to convince me to stop using Eco styler. Lol these the same mfers that put coconut oil on their faces? I think the fuck not

8929 2018-06-11 03:44:05 Tea tree oil and or baking soda (mixed into a paste with water) will make it go away in a day or two 
8930 2018-06-11 03:43:45 @PandaJay  confused odisha politics? When oil rate increase all say modi is increase it, why not ₹1 rice is giving modi say Naveen patnaik.
2.If you want to help the farmers then,you should help them by taking field by rent and paymnt them.Not doing lazy them by giving ₹1 Rice.

8932 2018-06-11 03:43:28 Over the winter my hair was so dry and gross. The argan oil helps maintain healthy texture. And I like applying it after I shower when my hair is still wet. Also often times I won't brush my hair after I shower I don't want to deal with tangles.
8933 2018-06-11 03:43:14 Dip my blunt of  in some THC oil 
8934 2018-06-11 03:42:54 @narendramodi confused odisha politics?

8935 2018-06-11 03:42:50 Also modified food starch and xanthan gum are ingredients to provide texture in fat-free dressings, because oil isn't there to do the job. To bad not to have oil with some vegetal omega 3 ALA and/or polyphenols instead. In one dressing, there was even 10g sugar per small pouch!
8936 2018-06-11 03:42:47 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
8937 2018-06-11 03:42:44 It’s not that I don’t believe you, I just choose to see what’s going on around me before I can make a full judgment. Our biggest Oil refinery in NWI has literally been hiring Carpenters, Electricians, Pipefitters, Irownworkers like no other the past year....
8938 2018-06-11 03:42:42 Probably not lol I mean you should still get it checked if it's consistently on or usually it just needs a oil change but mine does that to me Everytime I wanna get a smog check lol
8939 2018-06-11 03:42:26 @realDonaldTrump how about doing the same for the oilfield? To many Gulf Coast offshore employees are out of work due to big oil using cheap foreign labor. American companies cannot compete unless they use foreign workers also.

8946 2018-06-11 03:41:31 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8947 2018-06-11 03:41:30 I've even seen some "socialists" arguing we should keep using fossil fuels or take over the oil companies

8950 2018-06-11 03:41:05 I don't disagree with the original motive..however...the US is now the largest oil producer in the world AND has been an oil exporter since 2011.

What resources are you talking about? Slaves?

8962 2018-06-11 03:39:08 The only fool in this equation is Trump. Is there a world leader this narcissistic snake oil salesman hasn't pissed off? When his party gets crushed in the mid terms, he will become nothing more than a whining snivelling cartoon with no real power
8963 2018-06-11 03:39:02 You haven’t lived life until you’ve exfoliated your whole body in the shower and then followed up with body oil lmao. I feel luxurious right now
8964 2018-06-11 03:39:00 If Jacinda Ardern says the decision isn't made until Cabinet votes, does that mean the oil and gas decision is still up for grabs?
8965 2018-06-11 03:38:47 this coconut oil is heaven to my scalp
8966 2018-06-11 03:38:44 Ok, even if you don’t agree iPhones are very important to our society (for safety and communication), do you not agree we need oil?  Do you want to pay $7 a gallon for gas because of an oil shortage just because Trump refuses to have a good relationship with other countries?

8970 2018-06-11 03:38:31 I’m a vegetarian. Would olive oil be better for cooking vegetables than vegetable oils?

8972 2018-06-11 03:38:11 Canada and the United States are having problems because of their liberal @ far left - leader - he’s nuts - but as he tries to screw up our relationship - we are quietly going ahead with join oil/natural gas projects - Athabaskan oil fields my favorite - I love those tar sands -
8973 2018-06-11 03:38:09 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

8975 2018-06-11 03:37:41 So it’s a snooze fest as decisions are passed onto working groups, yet he’s annoyed that oil and gas exploration decision wasn’t passed over to further working groups........? ...........  what an idiot! Good luck with this one Nat voters 
8976 2018-06-11 03:37:36 I'm from Oklahoma. I was just visiting that leftist liberal state where all that corn oil was coming up thru they don't have a problem buying that stuff they don't have a problem keeping the people

8981 2018-06-11 03:36:39 Tbh plain old cerave from the tub is the BEST for extremely dry skin. I also really like vanicream; it’s cruelty free & very similar to cerave. I reccomend topping off with rosehip oil to lock that moisture in.
8982 2018-06-11 03:36:36 All oil so you keep eggin me on and we gon have to crack ya shell just to prove to you you ain’t hard boiled 

8983 2018-06-11 03:36:32 This is exactly why I enjoyed the salad without this dressing! I spoke loud about the 10g sugar content of this low fat dressing while waiting in line, and someone argued: "sugar is for the taste!". But a trait of olive oil has a wonderful taste with no added sugar, isn't it?

8988 2018-06-11 03:35:47 why do white girls swear by coconut oil?

8990 2018-06-11 03:35:27 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
8991 2018-06-11 03:35:25 What if I told you all our wars were a scam to cause HIGHER oil prices and INTENTIONALLY collapse the dollar in order to make our properly invested friends trillions (mining stocks hit their lowest prices in history 2 years ago) and bring about a world government?
8992 2018-06-11 03:35:00 You’re selling out our beautiful national lands to oil and gas interests and enriching yourself and your friends while you do it. Asshat!
8993 2018-06-11 03:34:56 Yea more jobs than ppl in decades is a prob.
Rising wages, lower taxes, Less regulation, bigger deductions for families, reformed VA,  is terrible.

8995 2018-06-11 03:34:36 My cup needs an oil change
8996 2018-06-11 03:34:35 Times like this, I be wishing I had a husband to draw me a bath, carry and put me in it, bathe me, dry me off, oil my body, & clothe me in my jammies. Then put me in the bed 
8997 2018-06-11 03:34:26 Motor oil
8998 2018-06-11 03:34:25 Rosemary oil is 
8999 2018-06-11 03:34:23 Also, go crush a plate of shrimp, garlic and olive oil angel hair at Carmine’s for me. Tasted pretty great the other night, but to be fair I had about 7 beers just before we ate, so I may have been eating a napkin for all I know.
9000 2018-06-11 03:33:46 Is everything made of dairy?

Is your car, house, road, computer, table, shirt, toy, shoe, television, toothbrush, bible, shower curtain, oil, candle, hat, soap, leash ALL MADE OUT OF DAIRY?

No?

Then why are you pretending as though a dairy tariff is the be-all, end-all? 

Duh.
9001 2018-06-11 03:33:43 This emu oil blend I have loved and used for years is off prime and now I gotta pay a whole 13 bucks for shipping. That makes the tiny bottle around $50. I’m really about to spend 50 bucks bc this shit is literally that good, sigh.
9002 2018-06-11 03:33:40 omg wth I thought the baby oil was enough
9003 2018-06-11 03:33:17 I put too much castor oil on my eyelashes now my eyes are on fireeee!
9004 2018-06-11 03:33:11 And that flow of garbage in the editorial and production rooms of those same media outlets that exaggerate the oil leak stories.
9005 2018-06-11 03:33:08 @CanadianPMO_RBX  To tame USA, enter into long agreement of oil supply with India which will be favourable to u! India needs oil and your helping hand will help both mutually!!!
9006 2018-06-11 03:33:05 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
9007 2018-06-11 03:32:59 Coconut oil fixes everything
9008 2018-06-11 03:32:51 So every time the US wants to invade some other country to get their oil while claiming we're looking for WMDs, they should pay us money AND send their young people to die there?

Sure. Our Allies should go for that! And then they can get insulted by our president! 

Great plan!!
9009 2018-06-11 03:32:49 Ashlyn: they’re not very expensive on here

Camryn: you’re not very expensive 
 
(Talking about essential oil diffusers)
9010 2018-06-11 03:32:31 I am skeptical for reasons I stated before. CO2 reduces interfacial tension that binds oil molecules to the pore spaces in reservoir rock. To work, there must be permeability for the CO2 to enter the pores & even more for larger oil molecule to exit. No perm, no extra oil.
9011 2018-06-11 03:32:27 It's also likely Putins hail Mary as oil fades into history. There's a reason it's happening now.

9019 2018-06-11 03:31:19 Please stop believing that fat is bad for you, it’s actually really really good for you (avocado, olive oil, chia seeds, nuts)
9020 2018-06-11 03:31:15 Ask him to release the numbers on what they make on trade with Canada; how we’ve sold all our Oil to American companies.

9022 2018-06-11 03:30:52 And what's the tax rate on synthetic intermediate oil? Look, there are tariffs on certain categories of goods between NAFTA countries, but most goods don't have tariffs if they originate from a NAFTA country. Rules on transshipment are different.
9023 2018-06-11 03:30:49 We have made concentrated oils that kill cancers and other diseases.  Vaping high thc oil for 10 years have gotten me off alot of medications. And also my type II diabetes is under control
9024 2018-06-11 03:30:31 恐れ多い。
9025 2018-06-11 03:30:15 Pure Castile soap, apple cider vinegar diluted with water as toner, & pure almond oil as serum 
9026 2018-06-11 03:30:02 Black African soap and maracuja Oli has helped clear up my skin alot! 
I just wash my face with the soap and my Clarisonic 
Then I tone with rose water 
Then I mix the oil in with my moisturizer and put that ish all over my face ears neck and chest
9027 2018-06-11 03:29:55 the baby in the oil game?
9028 2018-06-11 03:29:46 Had fun burning the midnight oil with @eschuchasplz @casedoggger
9029 2018-06-11 03:29:44 Pake kleveru jojoba oil ternyata sangat work di muka. Udh beli dari lama tpi blm pernah dipake. Cuma pake yg sunflo sama ricebran.
Huhuhuuu luv luv 
9030 2018-06-11 03:29:37 So the prize of crude oil has to do with the President. ...?
9031 2018-06-11 03:29:29 so morphe colors are so pigmented that my eyelid is slightly stained purple pink. and I used baby oil, water, and Clinique take the day off oil
9032 2018-06-11 03:29:13 avocado oil is such a great substitute for butter (even on ur toast) !!!!!
9033 2018-06-11 03:29:07 I am confused about odisha politics? When oil rate increase all say modi is increase it, why not ₹1 rice is giving modi say Naveen patnaik.
2.If you want to help the farmers then,you should help them by taking field by rent and paymnt them.Not doing lazy them by giving ₹1 Rice.
9034 2018-06-11 03:29:02 nyatanya ada yg punya efek lebih menenangkan di banding lilin aromatherapy dan essential oil
9035 2018-06-11 03:29:02 Once again trump is distorting the facts and outright lying!  He doesn’t even admit that we buy most of our oil from Canada!

9037 2018-06-11 03:28:45 Lol as soon as they step off the tarmac — baby oil and all
9038 2018-06-11 03:28:36 California has created tens of millions of permanent green energy jobs in the last decade or so. How many coal miners and oil platform workers are even left out there?
9039 2018-06-11 03:28:22 The tariffs are the taxes paid for the "goods" to cross the border.
If XYZ Corporation sends a load of synthetic intermediate oil across the border into Ontario Province, XYZ pays the Ministry of Finance a tax of "K" based on the declared value of the load, "S".
9040 2018-06-11 03:28:20 I saw a picture of "pan-fried" frozen, mixed veggies. That is the worst thing ever.
You pan-fry mushrooms, onions, peppers: things that can take a little oil and go well when they have a little char to crisp them up. You don't do it on peas, carrots, broccoli, or green beans!
9041 2018-06-11 03:28:16 Damn straight. The billionairesnake oil salesman speaks for the working class like me!!  He says dumb shit like me   

These millionaire actor types can take their hoity toity opinions and shove it.
9042 2018-06-11 03:28:03 (´・ω・`)にきぃ
9043 2018-06-11 03:27:39 I think you might have a bit of confusion on this.  Where does your energy sector come from?  Natural gas? Umm oil?  How about your clean water?  Almost all your lumber?  Do I dare mention a majority of your automotive supplies?  I think you might want to fact check 
9044 2018-06-11 03:27:32 Time for Canada to turn off the oil, water and low cost energy.
9045 2018-06-11 03:27:30 Good point. Just like the oil n gas ban announcement to make JA look good in Europe
9046 2018-06-11 03:27:26 まだ生ぬるいんだねきっとーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗw
9047 2018-06-11 03:27:26 Stop stealing oil from countries...that is the true unfairness jajaja
9048 2018-06-11 03:27:23 Gold Prices Stuck as US Dollar, Yields Offer Conflicting Cues
Gold prices are locked in place as the US Dollar and Treasury bond yields chart divergent paths. Crude oil prices await clarity on OPEC-led supply cut...
9049 2018-06-11 03:27:19 1) Calling Canada is a "strategic threat" is disingenuous. We are hurt.

7. Serve

Lots of potassium as well
Try heating pad.
Also meditate and breathe. Stress will make it worse.

9133 2018-06-11 03:12:10 Last time I looked the US imports roughly 58% of your crude oil and sweet light crude from us.  Ontario's gas is cheaper, in BC it's been as high as $1.68/ litre for unleaded, and $1.91/litre for premium unleaded.

9183 2018-06-11 03:03:57 Texas oil is profitable at a much lower price per barrel than Alberta Bitumen so Texas oil will ALWAYS be doing better than Alberta.  It is because they pump it out if the ground they don’t extract it. That is a fact from an oil and gas worker.

9188 2018-06-11 03:02:42 I love seeing hypocrite Canadians who say we have come together to counter Trumps tariffs. Where the fuck was the federal govt and all these Canadians when @jjhorgan was threatening to limit oil trade with Alberta!? The hypocrisy is astounding! I see right through thier BULLSHIT!
9189 2018-06-11 03:02:36 Maybe instead of bailing out Texas Oil Giant KinderMorgan or subsidizing $B #fossilfuelindustry to the time of $3.6B/yrs? with Cdn taxpayer's money? Just a thought.
9190 2018-06-11 03:02:30 Luckily us Canadians know a snake oil salesman when we see one. It’s like America got divorced and some scum bag she met at a bar moved in and took over. When his ass is gone, we’ll be back to being best buds. 
9191 2018-06-11 03:02:26 Please stop. 
Just. Stop.

The world doesn't need any more of the bullshit snake oil you're selling. 
9192 2018-06-11 03:02:21 ร้านไหนรับพรีเคทาวน์+นัดรับแถวรังสิตบ้างคะ #ตลาดนัดBLACKPINK
9193 2018-06-11 03:01:59 Seems to me you have a liberal vein in you... Trump would make a fine pm , at the very least he would not have spent 4.5 billion plus on a Canadian oil and gas project that should have costed Canadians 0000000 dollars..
9194 2018-06-11 03:01:58 I swear by Moroccan oil! A small (nickel-quarter size depending on how much hair you have) rubbed in between your hands, then mid shift to the end of your hair when wet. Less is more!
9195 2018-06-11 03:01:38 Yep. In a pan with some olive oil/ gets all the crispy dark bits!!!! To due for!!! You won’t regret it!
9196 2018-06-11 03:01:26 Finn is having fun with the baby oil stuff and we enjoy it so it's a win win
9197 2018-06-11 03:01:25 Getting off oil helps with climate change and hurts Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest sources of funding for global terror. A win win!

9201 2018-06-11 03:01:07 Break through in battery technology . Charging  in 5 minutes through capacitors . But we need strong wiring to charge . Charging stations to be designed with separate electric lines . Battery  and solar paint are the future game changers and challengers to oil problems . Relevant

9205 2018-06-11 03:00:46 Stir together 4 cups eggplant with 2 quarts baked Alaska. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve with love.
9206 2018-06-11 03:00:39 I hear good things about their oil quality and customer support, as well.
9207 2018-06-11 03:00:28 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
9208 2018-06-11 03:00:15 China asks (demands) dual operations for oil stocks in the South China Sea, even if the stocks are clearly within Filipinos or Vietnamese EEZ.
9209 2018-06-11 03:00:08 That’s why we need to get off of ALL oil, not just imported oil. We understood this clearly back in 2004 when RMI released “Winning the Oil Endgame”, so it’s long past time for the rest of the world to figure this out.
9210 2018-06-11 02:59:57 Soy is in pretty much all processed foods. Read the ingredients and it'll have soy lecithin or soybean oil or some other soy byproduct in almost all processed foods. You don't find that stuff in whole foods unless it's soy.

Fermented, organic soy is actually good for you BTW.
9211 2018-06-11 02:59:56 I really need to get some coconut oil but I’m lazy ugh
9212 2018-06-11 02:59:39 Uneducated comment...  currently the US is purchasing Canadian oil at a discount and reselling it at world prices due to Canada’s lack of pipeline Capacity to tide water...  who is the bloodsucker? #OrangeIsTheNewIdiot
9213 2018-06-11 02:59:37 The national security threat is not the country but the steel and aluminum,  we have lost the ability to be self- sufficient in the forging of specialized alloys needed for military and other items.  Same reason we ha e strategic reserves for helium and oil.

9217 2018-06-11 02:58:49 You have the audacity to buy a contract for southern Cameroons oil from La Republic Du Cameroon even though you know Southern Cameroons is separating? That desl is illegal and you are warned. Stay away from southern Cameroons. Contact Southern Cameroons government.
9218 2018-06-11 02:58:43 As long as Fallout 76 lets me play offline, then I'm sold. 

Even if Todd Howard fuckin' drools snake oil, the man knows how to sell ideas. He's Bethesda's best PR.
9219 2018-06-11 02:58:33 You have the audacity to buy a contract for southern Cameroons oil from La Republic Du Cameroon even though you know Southern Cameroons is separating? That desl is illegal and you are warned. Stay away from southern Cameroons. Contact Southern Cameroons government.

9222 2018-06-11 02:57:55 I really gotta wake up early as shit to get Gunner’s oil change 
9223 2018-06-11 02:57:54 His whole idea is based on a false premise, that these countries NEED us. Um, nope no they don't. It's a GLOBAL economy now. There are other customers and other suppliers. And when prices double or triple for us just because they're sick of his bs them what? Oil already rising.
9224 2018-06-11 02:57:45 復活～！！！良かった！！！！
つらかったねええええヾ(･ω･`*)
良くなって良かった！！！！！！
9225 2018-06-11 02:57:21 Olay but for it to be falling in ya food? Tea tree oil and peppermint, you gotta become a whole witch with this
9226 2018-06-11 02:56:37 Finn is going to pick up the bottle next video than put it down after that the next video he will put the oil on and it will be like that back and forth 
9227 2018-06-11 02:56:31 tj max and ross and marshals sometimes have some diffusers and i say try some different scents and find what relaxes you cuz for example tea tree oil relaxes my sister but i hate the smell
9228 2018-06-11 02:56:12 Someone kept repeating to me that the Falkland Islands war was “obviously” about “erl” and I was stupid to think there was no oil there.
9229 2018-06-11 02:56:10 Congratulations @carson_macedo, @cmn3g, Tim, Joe & the rest of your team on another win
9230 2018-06-11 02:55:56 Announces elder scrolls vi , *5 seconds of land over view* Todd vanishes. The oil baron knows what to do
9231 2018-06-11 02:55:52 Todd Howard bleeds snake oil but I still am looking forward to most everything he talked about.
9232 2018-06-11 02:55:29 No, it's not 'critical' to the future of the Gulf Coast, or any other part of America. Oil and gas E&P is a dinosaur industry, lumbering into the tar pits that will seal its fate. Solar and wind will power our future.
9233 2018-06-11 02:55:22 I think you're reading it that way. Renewables can't even replaced a fraction of 1% of oil today and won't for many years yet. Electric vehicles simply aren't ready yet. Adoption is a process, EVs are at the very beginning of that process.
9234 2018-06-11 02:55:04 Trudeau thing.  Also mascara and eyeliner.  He loves dress up and performance and right now he’s player the leader of Canada
9235 2018-06-11 02:55:04 Can’t wait to try this oil diffuser Toni got me 
9236 2018-06-11 02:55:03 @DayDreamThis Ok I know NJPW has my attention right now, but whats with this stuff, involving Finn Balor rubbing baby oil and other stuff on himself ? Feels like the rehearsal for a vivid film

9242 2018-06-11 02:53:36 DeNiro is a TV and movie tough guy. Which means he’s the handjob of the useful idiots.
9243 2018-06-11 02:53:35 The US is NOT a net exporter of oil. We consume about 20M barrels per day, of which about half is imported.
9244 2018-06-11 02:53:19 Italian BMT on toasted herbed cheese bread - hold the Mayo - add olive oil & vinegar - Everything except jalapeños and pickles -extra banana peppers
9245 2018-06-11 02:53:12 @gillespi David do I have to go wholefoodplantbased, or is another trend? Can't is  just stop eating sugar, oil etc and eat mainly unprocessed foods?
9246 2018-06-11 02:53:03 I don’t understand how people don’t take care of their car like they laugh about not getting oil changes n shit like who gonna be laughing when your car breaks down...your bank my guy when your overdraw your account on Ubers 
9247 2018-06-11 02:52:50 It’s been a while soooo which time slot is better for getting your car oil changed?
9248 2018-06-11 02:52:39 Dad: “Hey do we use that spray stuff or do we use granola oil?”
9249 2018-06-11 02:52:28 One 55 gallon drum per day should do the trick...the kind oil is stored in.
9250 2018-06-11 02:52:15 Haha! @Potus OWNS the left. He lives in their heads...just toys with them...#WINNING
9251 2018-06-11 02:52:04 Yes, mid-east has oil, so make the SOBs pay for their protection.  Trump is making the Saudis pay for our help vs Iran; much more than before.  Yes, we have to adapt to Far East competition, BUT we don't have to spot them the protection/ tariffs agst us.WHY US cops of the world?
9252 2018-06-11 02:52:03 Our country is ill? Record low unemployment across all sectors and demographics. Record high stock market, growing consumer confidence, denuclearization, peace breaking out. Where is the problem?
9253 2018-06-11 02:51:53 I rage quit earlier on my chocolate account but when I get home from school tomorrow I can beat that ass use the bull guy to your getting exposed son I won’t even use a weapon you ain’t doing to me what oil did to @cawnnyt

9256 2018-06-11 02:51:22 Ooooo hok tu. Yela dah pakai mascara and makeup semua kena pandai cuci la taknak clog pores. Kalau aku pakai wet tissue, letak makeup remover atas tu pastu cuci pakai oil cleanser then baru facial cleanser. Kalau rasa patut scrub, sental dgn scrub baru rasa bersih sikit
9257 2018-06-11 02:51:19 Keep oil in place, esp for those uses where there is no alternative,  but grow alternatives as fast as possible.
9258 2018-06-11 02:51:02 Oil, natural gas, fresh drinking water. Nothing important.
9259 2018-06-11 02:51:01 Photoshopped?
9260 2018-06-11 02:50:59 that shower was lovely and this peppermint oil has my scalp feeling good
9261 2018-06-11 02:50:58 ahahaha i didn’t see this. lmao why am i arguing about us exploiting the middle east for oil to a guy who stans exxon? i’m out

9270 2018-06-11 02:49:55 I would add to @_max_m's comment, that somehow these arguments always wind up sounding like "Alt energy can't replace ALL petro uses, so we should reject them  wholesale. "  If solar, wind etc can replace 10% of oil right now, let's do it.

9276 2018-06-11 02:49:01 I have no self control around bread with olive oil, balsamic and parmesan . It’s the bet snack anywhere and everywhere 
9277 2018-06-11 02:48:56 Okay so this is what’s happening isn’t it? The oil are gonna draft Ty Smith and then think it’s okay to trade Klefbom because Ty will be the “Klefbom replacement”. I can see this happening that’s the sad thing 
9278 2018-06-11 02:48:51 Trade is not a red line for India, who are probably bemused with Trump. But sanctions concerning arms imports from Russia and oil imports from Iran are no laughing matter. Pushing on these would definitely impact US-India ties
9279 2018-06-11 02:48:40 Oil was discovered in Uganda in 2006.

9286 2018-06-11 02:47:59 I also agree but, class does not make things happen, solve problems or sell oil sand.
9287 2018-06-11 02:47:54 I'm sick of them telling us what to think or how to think > I hear the news and I really don't need them to tell what is or has been said !!!!!!!!!

Fine, scrap all of NAFTA. In 5 years I’ll be laughing at you when our oil is being sent to the coasts and your refineries are paying Brent prices for it instead of WTI.
9296 2018-06-11 02:46:00 Pretty simply.  I like mine with garlic, butter/olive oil and Parmesan.  I steam them for a few minutes then put them in the frying pan.  I’ve also put them into omelettes.

9298 2018-06-11 02:45:49 Just another example of why our Founders didn't want religion sneaking into our government. Hell is another marketing gimmick used to scare people into following snake oil salesmen. Navarro is a moron in so many ways for making this statement! He should leave government, NOW!
9299 2018-06-11 02:45:42 The biggest tell, KJU deliberately photographed fake crying in public. My guess: the fix was in via   & Republicans long b4 2016. Russia the country of oil & R’s, the Party of oil, aligned. R’s feeling entitled & just assumed they would take over in 2016.

9310 2018-06-11 02:44:11 Let me ask you something... we were paying the same prices for gas, what, around the beginning of Obama-era? Oil field was booming, people had jobs. Prices dropped & civilians were excited, but the oilfield workers felt the cut when they're layoffs cost them their lives.

9325 2018-06-11 02:42:21 Bob Conservative Donald Trump transparent Donald Trump knows what he doing failing at it big time Its time for Conservative Justin Trudeau too take action like right now cut Quebec power to the states and shut down the Taps from Alberta oil shut it down NOW Conservative Trudeau
9326 2018-06-11 02:42:13 True. I remember when Wikileaks first dropped the State Dept cables and there was the "terrorists wish list" the media called it, but it was basically irreplaceable infrastructure and assets across the west.

Pharma was just as big as oil on it.
9327 2018-06-11 02:42:00 A candle lit essential oil bath and worship music is surely setting me up to take on this week 
9328 2018-06-11 02:41:56 Am tired of their fights w/ Trump propaganda talking-heads. Occasionaly they might dip a toe into actual relevance but not enough to wake folks up.  They need to cover Russian globalization, warnings from ex-KGB, the coming battle for Arctic oil (thanks to Global Warming).

9333 2018-06-11 02:41:44 Sorry but the thoughts of Puff the Magic Dragon come to mind when-a teacher is trying to deliver a fiscally efficient energy program in the richest and most important oil province in Canada. It’s a fairy tale about to go horribly wrong. Go Team Kenney!
9334 2018-06-11 02:41:42 Well duh! So if we get "news fatigue" & turn him off doesnt that put him out of a job? Journalist are really dumb!
9335 2018-06-11 02:41:27 Todd Howard is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, used car salesman and snake oil peddler I can recall in my lifetime
9336 2018-06-11 02:41:25 Hahahaha
9337 2018-06-11 02:41:08 I will never look at coconut oil the same way
9338 2018-06-11 02:40:41 It’s making a loud sound, the rotation isn’t smooth so it’s not drying. I believe it leaked oil too.

9342 2018-06-11 02:39:39 Apple cider vinegar, put it in a spray bottle, leave on for a few minutes,it’ll burn for a few minutes until you wash it off but it helps sooo much, and then shower in the hottest water you can stand, and then use coconut oil after your shower, and then cold showers after that.
9343 2018-06-11 02:39:29 What  massive heads and tiny brains these folks in the msm have!

9347 2018-06-11 02:38:21 Free markets can't be manipulated by lobyists. Maybe should learn what a free market is. How is oil companies waging war through governement free market?

9358 2018-06-11 02:36:49 Why is this news now CBC? So JT buys this leaky pipeline and makes $$ on oil stocks! Why is there no lawyer representing this woman? Was the leak in Kamloops last week cleaned up yet? How about that train spilling oil last week, is it too early for pipeheads to brag of Safty ?
9359 2018-06-11 02:36:46 I got this new essential oil lotion. Supposed to be good for hurting muscles.

9365 2018-06-11 02:36:08 Hasn't been a question in my mind for a long time.  I am not a reporter so i don't have to have sources,  so i get to guess.   Everything points to him owing Putin LOTS of money or wanting a piece of the triple trillion dollar oil field in Russia. It sure as hell isn't to help us
9366 2018-06-11 02:36:05 Oil prices were mixed on Monday, caught between the downward pull of rising Russian production and U.S. oil drilling activity at its highest since 2015, and upward pressure from strong demand, especially in Asia.
9367 2018-06-11 02:36:01 Like I put an oil to match my moods
9368 2018-06-11 02:35:46 oil you are bought by. No credibility. Sad. Please stop misleading people.
9369 2018-06-11 02:35:46 Only venezuela gets on my nerves but then I remember venezuela believes in this "artificial poverty" scam. Maybe one day Maduro will calm down bcz oil prices will never go back so high.
9370 2018-06-11 02:35:36 you should add tea tree oil if you have it. but it smells weirder HONESTLY
9371 2018-06-11 02:35:35 My bumbass left the oil pressure gauge unhooked and fired it up lol

9375 2018-06-11 02:35:08 German is going down with illegal aliens committing crime and rape. They Are controlled by Russia because of their oil from this communist country. German cars will go bankrupt if Trump put tariff on them! Good luck Angela Merkel with your big month! Don't mess up with Trump!
9376 2018-06-11 02:35:05 Global Cues: US Oil Drilling Activity Rose To Its Highest Level Since March 2015
9377 2018-06-11 02:34:55 And yet you have no problem with tRumps ties with Russia and Zinkes ties to the Cattlemen's Assoc and oil conglomerates, paying him to exploit OUR public lands and kill off every single mustang left.  Shame on you.
9378 2018-06-11 02:34:48 It’s not about safety, that’s all propaganda. Oil Is a Leading Cause of War. Between one-quarter and one-half of interstate wars since 1973 have been linked to oil. next 30 to 40 years , USA will be competing with Russia and China for natural resources and markets.

9384 2018-06-11 02:34:20 India's fuel demand rose 3.4% in May compared with same month last year. Consumption of fuel, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 18.72 mil tonnes, data from the PPAC of the oil ministry showed. Sales of gasoline, or petrol, were 2.0% higher from a year earlier at 2.46 mil tonnes.
9385 2018-06-11 02:34:14 Yang kmk baca suzy, guna cleansing oil dengan clay mask yg sesuai dengan kulit ktk. Cause cleansing oil dgn clay mask cleanses deeply into the skin. Scrub ktk dah ada, so dah ada agent utk buang kulit mati, just deep pore cleansing jak gik.

9393 2018-06-11 02:33:23 See, when I am startled, I have an autonomous response. I flail and stomp my feet, and my elbows fly around. I fall and trip and stumble. Did you know it can take as little as 7 lbs to break the top of the foot?
9394 2018-06-11 02:33:07 i went to Oklahoma and left my car @ my parents and when i came back my dad surprises me with an oil change, full tank & new tires!!! #blessed
9395 2018-06-11 02:32:57 Why aren’t they protesting incoming tankers from oil producing countries with lower environmental standards?
9396 2018-06-11 02:32:54 I do my popcorn stove top with olive or coconut oil - turmeric, coriander, cumin seeds and cayenne pepper - turns out awesome!
9397 2018-06-11 02:32:53 A. If it has the word "garbage" in it... non mangiarlo!

Pazzesco!
9398 2018-06-11 02:32:39 I get my oil change this week this weekend n.c here we go guess I'm going to see Uncle sonnie#spoiledrotten
9399 2018-06-11 02:32:37 Yeah that might net in your paycheck that’ll disappear in a few years. Handouts. Yeah we give enough of them to oil companies and chemical company airs and huge farm conglomerates so why would people need them?
9400 2018-06-11 02:32:36 nowadays men love to ask a woman can she cook, but honey can you change a tire, change oil, fix anything ... can you even name the parts of a car?
9401 2018-06-11 02:32:19 Oil is a dying industry. Get over it.

9423 2018-06-11 02:30:32 Here’s an idea. No more oil from Alberta. Instead we will use the XL pipeline to ship the excess milk to Canada to be used in fracking. Two problems solved. Now will congress resolve to stop messing with market (milk specifically) so the excesses will moderate?

9429 2018-06-11 02:29:15 Frankincense, lavender, basil, cedarwood, lemongrass & sweet almond. I found this recipe a while back but it helps with destressing & relaxing ! It just smells kind of medicinal. You can always add a fruity oil to it though .

9435 2018-06-11 02:28:36 Yup. The city has come a long way over the past few years. I think it's going to keep getting better-just need some variety in industry to make sure it keeps growing when oil struggles.
9436 2018-06-11 02:28:17 Oil prices were mixed on Monday, caught between the downward pull of rising Russian production and U.S. oil drilling activity at its highest since 2015, and upward pressure from strong demand, especially in Asia.
9437 2018-06-11 02:28:04 Junior College is basically free. Some online colleges are free. If you are motivated, you can teach yourself. Hoping for some government program to help bring back coal, buggy whips and whale oil jobs is lazy.
9438 2018-06-11 02:27:57 I need to change my oil and a tire rotation.

9446 2018-06-11 02:26:08 I agree, but I have to add that I'm getting tired of my government selling our oil super cheap to the States, then you guys sell it on the world market at a profit. And we're shipping in that shit from the middle east at world prices. What's up with that? #notmyprimeminister
9447 2018-06-11 02:25:34 Canada could sell their oil to Asia if trump will allow an exemption from NAFTA requirements. 3 million barrels per day ~ $72 million USD per year of erased trade.

9464 2018-06-11 02:23:11 A look at some major oil powers suggests that many, possibly most of them, are heavily investing in solar, partly so they can generate more local power without tapping into their main export resource. Somebody ought to be pushing for a solar Nigeria. Geographically, it's ideal!!
9465 2018-06-11 02:23:04 Yes - I love investing in oil/natural gas drilling - all kinds - shale a favorite, I love pipelines - transport what we need - love refineries - must have products - most recently into LNG production facilities and transport - even the specialized tankers - American based energy
9466 2018-06-11 02:22:52 Paul, you are entitled to your opinion. With status quo gone, devomax non existent as the Smith opportunity for real powers was lost and Brexit a basket case armageddon for WM the indy option for many is far less scary than say 5 years ago. Oil at double the price helps as well.

9468 2018-06-11 02:22:51 Very simple: olive oil, some paprika and oregano, salt - sometimes just a dash of wheat beer. Same goes for the carrots and green beans.
9469 2018-06-11 02:22:49 When scissoring goes wrong ....you better put some oil on that shit
9470 2018-06-11 02:22:47 You want God to do something? Fill the water pots~Pour the oil~Dip 7 times~Start marching! Do what HE says&He will do the Miracles!
9471 2018-06-11 02:22:45 Overwrought to say the least.
9472 2018-06-11 02:22:37 Milk is a tiny fraction of Canadian trade & now big American oil companies & others are leaving Canada who has been a very loyal & helpful ally for many years. Billions of $ lost, so--- Trudeau's only option was not to kiss your butt.
9473 2018-06-11 02:22:34 Did you know we are importing 40% of our oil from Canada?
9474 2018-06-11 02:22:34 When the socialist regime takes over, they will be the first to kill for those chicken sandwiches.

9478 2018-06-11 02:22:16 Reading more about wigs on the internet, it might be possible to save this one with some argan oil. Its just dried out pretty badly, which happens with age with these things, but I havent worn it that much so it might be saveable
9479 2018-06-11 02:22:04 I honestly don’t think there’s anything that tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar can’t fix

9486 2018-06-11 02:21:14 @mrBobbyBones whatever happened to the Arkansas oil worker who sang on the show
9487 2018-06-11 02:21:08 How so... you only protect oil and your own interests.
9488 2018-06-11 02:21:07 1. Running cool water (not cold) over the burned area for 5-10 mins 

2. Aloe Vera products, Honey, Coconut oil, or vinegar over area with a cotton ball or whatever will make application the least painful

Also why does everybody look like they took a bath in oil in the game? xD
9492 2018-06-11 02:20:55 They will deal, get right & get fair. Canada, USA & Mexico should have fair or free trade along with will all of America, North, Central & South. Cut off Middle-east Oil
9493 2018-06-11 02:20:53 What shill Trump is, for the insurance industry, oil industry, Russia, NRA.  Millions "trump" morals and the best interest of the American people, once again.  How he baldfaced lied during the campaign as an "outsider".  Pffft. @realDonaldTrump
9494 2018-06-11 02:20:35 I officially know how to refine oil by hand so I’m now taking applications if you want to be on my zombie apocalypse team

9502 2018-06-11 02:19:01 i got essential oil in my eyes and i’m dying
9503 2018-06-11 02:18:59 Diokno,DBM: inflation uptick due to global oil market prices (which we cannot control), incompetence of NFA announcing rice shortage which caused panic, they also didn’t accept our advice to allow private sector to import rice and just impose tariff @ANCALERTS

9507 2018-06-11 02:18:26 Fergal will look like a slug next week if this oil stuff continues.
9508 2018-06-11 02:18:16 Inflation would have gone up anyway this year sans TRAIN. The only diff really is the oil prods specific tax contribution to inflation rate. I think diesel had a bigger effect because it’s consumed far more than gasoline & bec of its impact on public transport & commerce.
9509 2018-06-11 02:17:56 Geran demonstrated a deep and thorough understanding of the oil tax travesty, and led the effort to undo the damage. She's a supremely sharp and studious legislator.
9510 2018-06-11 02:17:27 I tend to collect Biletnikoff winners so Dede's like a land purchase made without investigation. But any day I expect to get the call, "Sir, we've got good news to report. The No. 12 Well is gushing oil. 40.5 gravity crude. It's incredible."
9511 2018-06-11 02:17:16 Coconut oil does not belong on our faces
9512 2018-06-11 02:17:00 So nagbabasa ako kanina about Brunei's plan to fully adopt Shariah Law - as strict as KSA.  Pero natatagalan sila because extreme conservatism wards off foreign investors. And they need it coz oil reserves are not forever.
9513 2018-06-11 02:16:53 When I tell you I didn’t have to do NOTHING to my Honda but get ah oil change and new brakes. Bitch this Mazda  I don’t had to get new coils, a whole new transmission, new flywheel and more. I wanna sue Mazda at this point

9517 2018-06-11 02:16:16 they lie together;

they lie upon her: 
someone’s daughter.
9518 2018-06-11 02:16:14 I think Russia and China have realized their guy (Trump) needs a win to secure his presidency. Xi JingPing met Kim before this summit and Putin is meeting him afterwards to further plans. They both supplied oil to NK when the US sanctions were in effect, Trump was silent.
9519 2018-06-11 02:15:57 This corrupt hand picked tool is dangerous. Oil has nothing to do with the Earth’s constant rate of change. The Earth is not some static body that is always the same. Hey @Pontifex when was Earth not under Climate Change?

9526 2018-06-11 02:15:30 I’m in favour of moving away from oil as a fuel ASAP. But move before there are cost effective substitutes in the quantities needed, & you’ve got big problems. Like flying from Vancouver to Tokyo without assurance that you’ve got enough fuel.
9527 2018-06-11 02:15:18 We indigenous people lived in harmony with nature. No pollution, toxins,plastic or oil . Never had sugar diabetes .All was organic.Respected the earth who is our mother.Clean air and water. Education?

9529 2018-06-11 02:15:07 Rising oil prices put eurozone economy under strain...
9530 2018-06-11 02:15:03 We need oil. We need jobs and the taxes that come from those jobs that pay for the programs rabble says doesn't get enough money.
9531 2018-06-11 02:15:00 The Skin Kitchen now available at The Store.   Organic plant based ingredients hand made in New Zealand.  The hydrating facial oil is wonderful just sayin !

9533 2018-06-11 02:14:57 I just remembered I have this CBD oil at my house  I’m gonna rub it on my back and see if it works
9534 2018-06-11 02:14:45 Support you on this.
By the way all news media is FAKE, including foxy news.

9537 2018-06-11 02:14:25 Ummmm, duh. Enjoy the snake oil, gentlemen. And next time do your due diligence.
9538 2018-06-11 02:14:02 Yes so clean burning, non polluting, and held to such a rigorous environmental standard (insert eye roll here), unlike that stuff that Alberta produces. Nope. California oil like all other global oil is made of million year old Unicorn farts so it doesn't pollute! #abpoli
9539 2018-06-11 02:13:48 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
9540 2018-06-11 02:13:47 That can be solved two ways.
1. Stop spending so much taxes on bullshit wars and military bases. There's also a lot of "investment" money we give to very profitable companies that don't need or deserve it. I think we give $5 billion a year to oil companies. And more bad spending.

9545 2018-06-11 02:12:48 For awhile I was using KT tape  to hold my whole body together lol. I used it on my neck a lot and it helped but not as much as the CBD oil I take now has helped with the pain. It didn’t seem to hold it well enough that it never got out of place.

9548 2018-06-11 02:12:37 A fairly big glass bottle of vitamin e oil just fell into my unflushed (I’d just been, calm down) toilet so I was like ‘ah lemme flush the loo then retrieve this heavy, not-gonna-flush bottle of expensive oil’
NAHHH IT BLOODY WELL DID FLUSH AWAY DIDNT IT. Ffs
9549 2018-06-11 02:12:16 I always ask myself, "why the hell did I get into a debate, hundreds of replies worth, over Chic-fil-a."

9572 2018-06-11 02:09:12 Chavez and my dad could be friends. It's ridiculous because Chavez knew he needed big oil companies to ship and refine his crude, regardless of whether he nationalized the oil. It was so crazy because my dad liked Chavez and didn't say anything negative about  him ever.

9603 2018-06-11 02:04:23 My own (conspiracy) theory is that part of the deals for weapons and oil deals that Western powers have been making with KSA and the like included some "freedom of religion" clauses for a particular religion. I can't think why else the UK would let things get out of hand here.

9673 2018-06-11 01:54:36 In goods $17 billion deficit to Canada in because of oil last year. Add in trade of services and there's a surplus. Read a report, crack a book, listen to your advisors, and stop spouting garbage on twitter as a defense for attacking our allies.

9702 2018-06-11 01:49:51 They recommend not to cook with olive oil. It has a low boiling point..hence it burns very quickly.

Only use it for drizzles on salads

9712 2018-06-11 01:48:49 #oil is symbolic of Gods Holy Spirit.
the word says if a man doesn't have his Spirit he is none of his - Romans 8:9
You got to ask him to baptize you with his Spirit.
You can get filled with his Spirit by reading the word, but you need the initial baptism. Mathew 3:11
9713 2018-06-11 01:48:25 I still don't know what argan oil is or why it is sold as conditioner but if you want your hair to smell like dry cat food I recommend it

9715 2018-06-11 01:48:16 Decriminalize the word cannabis Mr. President. It will help with infrastructure. End it will help a dramatic cut down with any of the Medicaid Medicare systems. Because the cannabis oil treats auto immune deficiencies etc.
9716 2018-06-11 01:47:57 And US actually runs a trade surplus once you include services. At least as of 2017. But 3 million barrels per day of oil at $65 might change this. Although trump is partially responsible for this inflated price. Iran deal. But that oil represents 40% of oil imports.

9723 2018-06-11 01:47:04 Crude oil was once over 100 USD and the pump price was never over R13 so tell us again what you mean about petrol price being an international dinges
9724 2018-06-11 01:47:00 Its Putin wanting to divide and conquer. This was his plan all along. Canada also has a very large oil field in our north... it's all about driving a wedge so that he can take his place as world leader.

9754 2018-06-11 01:42:54 The battle for access to clean water by native folk and poor and middle class folks is already begun. Too many don't realize it will become a traded commodity, like oil but more valuable. That battle must be fought on all fronts.

9810 2018-06-11 01:35:29 I love using creams for my hair that contain oil/oil replacement esp Argan oil and shea butter based after (t-shirt) towel drying. Also never brush after washing, before is best to get the knots out. Condition only the tips, and use argan oil after it’s half dry (avoid roots!)

Good riddance to bad rubbish. #IStandWithCanada
9820 2018-06-11 01:34:39 Why would anyone think the oil companies are interested in climate change they're the biggest culpript for godsake
9821 2018-06-11 01:34:15 I used to only cook with extra virgin olive oil because I thought it was high quality and simultaneously wondering how anyone cooks on a stovetop without industrial ventilation.
9822 2018-06-11 01:33:41 I would like Canada, given the fact we got annexed by the US. I'm bias though. If they're unwilling to part with North America, set us up in some Vault that was put up here with the purpose of being an oil refinery / nuclear harvesting ground.
9823 2018-06-11 01:33:41 Why should they? Just because the USA bleeds money unchecked (no audits or accountability?) into the Military (for what? to protect oil?)????
9824 2018-06-11 01:33:32 You just need a bottle of bergamot oil
9825 2018-06-11 01:33:21 Fight acne where it starts: in the pore. Regular exfoliation helps to keep the pores free excess skin cells/oil. Regular exfoliation aids in the removal of dead skin cell buildup, reduces the formation of comedones, and helps smooth and soften the skin.

9895 2018-06-11 01:21:33 Eco: BSP's Guinigundo said they don’t use monetary policy to arrest oil prices, food and rice issues, and noted that upside pressure on inflation expectations appear to be easing.
9896 2018-06-11 01:21:26 Listen up skincare junkies... Charcoal doesn’t magnetically pull crap out of your pores, Salicylic Acid is not a ‘bacteria killer’, oil is not the enemy of oily skin, and the reason your $100 cream isnt working is because you dont exfoliate, you idiot.

9899 2018-06-11 01:21:08 But we export oil? Hopefully we'll be independent one day with all forms -wind, solar,oil so we aren't held hostage from overdependence on other countries and forced to accept their proposals "or else."
9900 2018-06-11 01:21:06 Now, the pope is getting in on the issue. Did the Vatican by any chance hire scientists to certify that oil producers will create environmental issues, or is he just pontificating as Pontiff always do?
9901 2018-06-11 01:21:05 Do you realize you get about half your oil/gas and a bunch of electricity for the northeast from Canada? Probably not.

9905 2018-06-11 01:20:27 We considered the BP Oil spill, storms, etc a big enough story to have reporters & cameras on the scene all the time--why is this not at least as big? It must be daily news, there must be shots of scenes inside these human warehouses, this must be made real to American viewers...
9906 2018-06-11 01:20:16 He’s not a #bot. Unless that’s what you call a oil rigger most likely lives in Calgary. Drives a truck and has a large Oakley collection to go with his truckers hats to cover the his balding spot. And loves himself some COCAINE! And #trump cock.
9907 2018-06-11 01:19:51 I actually thought someone should dare Trump to block Keystone Pipeline so Canada can’t move it’s oil from the tar sands to boats headed to China.

9914 2018-06-11 01:18:51 Wtf. Is this hinting that Canadian opposition to pipelines is being abetted by Russia? Keeping oil in the ground is ONLY about keeping carbon out of the air and water.
9915 2018-06-11 01:18:31 I don't eat corn products. Avoid high fructose corn syrup, corn meal, vegetable oil or anything else with corn or corn byproducts.

9917 2018-06-11 01:18:19 I drank a ton more water and used a mixture of coconut oil and Vaseline’s intensive car mosturizer (switch between them) and mine got so much better!
9918 2018-06-11 01:18:07 USA, has never been a customer for Iraq oil nor has it ever owned any of the resources since all then. Most experts go to Europe, with various European countries with equity in those resources.

Hes an international pariah that everyone is 95% sure is under the thumb of Putin.

No successes, no victories, price of oil is skyrocketing and his economic policy is backfiring immensely

9927 2018-06-11 01:17:10 #auspol yes well sorry don't believe that,  Howard definitely knew in my opinion. It was all about oil,  not about anything else really. 9.11 happened, is very sad but Iraq had nothing to do with it, it was all about profits!
9928 2018-06-11 01:17:04 How do you feel about CBD oil as it relates to cancer? My mom also has very bad anxiety.
9929 2018-06-11 01:17:00 We , the USA reached peak oil long ago. Instead of following through with electric in the 70’s we went elsewhere for oil.  Sad, bc we have a Sun. Even if CC didn’t exist oil spills should be enough for all of us to want to stop using fossil fuels for energy.
9930 2018-06-11 01:16:55 It’s my pleasure to walk side by side with fellow citizens. There is no where else I’d rather be. This is the Nigerian Spirit our founding father traded for Oil Money. It’s time to rethink and have a genuine National integration. We are society.
9931 2018-06-11 01:16:41 MR PRIME MINISTER MAYBE THIS CRISIS WITH ITALIAN DEBT CAN BE SOLVED BY INCREASING TRADE AND TAXING CERTAIN GOODS! LIKE OLIVE OIL ;AND WINE; AND CHEESE ;THE QUALITY IS THERE !MAYBE AN INCREASE OF EXPORTS TO INDIA AND CHINA AND UNITED STATES!

9937 2018-06-11 01:16:02 Trump’s policies appear to be all about pandering to his donors. Coal. Oil. Evangelicals. Putin.

9941 2018-06-11 01:15:49 You elected the biggest treasonous traitor ever. He wants to remove sanctions from Russia so Trump Towers Russia can be built, and  Exxonmoble/Roseneft Oil  merger can go forward. Both projects are worth billions to the Trump empire.

9955 2018-06-11 01:14:02 I think priests abusing young kids is worse than any oil problem, don’t you there Pontiff?

9961 2018-06-11 01:13:35 And the whole Dem party is owned by the Bezos, Soros, Oil Arabs etc. so what? Election campaigns cost money, rich people pay ALL politicians off.. Always have, always will, on both sides of the aisle, to believe otherwise is childish naivety.
9962 2018-06-11 01:13:33 The U.S.?  I doubt ever.  Alternative sources are suffering.  We import oil from all over.  Coal isn't the answer.  Heck, most of the North East funnels in electricity from Canada.

9965 2018-06-11 01:13:25 Strange how so many of the EU countries made very poor decisions regarding oil dependency on Russia, allowing millions of middle Eastern refugees who will not assimilate, and did not give adequate support to NATO until Trump insisted on it.
9966 2018-06-11 01:13:11 Sometimes God makes you go through some stuff just so you know the value of your oil.  @jamalhbryant @DavidGEvans1 #TheENCOUNTER #POG18
9967 2018-06-11 01:13:08 Love real olive oil and avocados. Love nuts too but my husband is allergic so eat them not at home and floss well
9968 2018-06-11 01:12:39 The cure for cancer comes from different arenas. Cannabis in the Extreme oil and the Holy oil of Christ are big winners.
9969 2018-06-11 01:12:31 Time to build the #energyeast pipeline to reduce our oil imports & exports from the US.
9970 2018-06-11 01:12:06 The oil of God is a trickle down system
9971 2018-06-11 01:12:02 Seriously, you keep bringing up dairy. Just have your own farmers provide dairy then! @realDonaldTrump a terrible argument. How about we talk about oil and hydro that you get cheaper than Canadians!?
9972 2018-06-11 01:11:58 As soon as I arrive to Texas, the cold showers I pull and try to trigger for, instead welcome with boiling hot water. I hope to god the liquid isn’t oil or gasoline just because they ran out of cold water
9973 2018-06-11 01:11:57 Sonic got through Oil Hell Zone: Act 1.
9974 2018-06-11 01:11:43 If I recalled correctly you were Vice President when Russia invaded their neighbors. So stop selling snake oil and insulting intelligence of the American people!
9975 2018-06-11 01:11:13 Just start rubbing baby oil on yourself lol
9976 2018-06-11 01:11:12 Then I guess we can keep our hydro, lumber, oil, amongst other things. Go it alone in the world and see how well you fare.
9977 2018-06-11 01:11:10 Russian oil
9978 2018-06-11 01:11:05 I do not recommend seeing Hereditary. It was all fun and games but the end threw me all the way off and now i need to go to my aunt’s house so she can anoint me with some Oil.
9979 2018-06-11 01:11:03 The US is currently importing about 1,900,000 barrels of oil per day from Canada. Canada is the largest oil supplier to the US. Get ready for higher gas  prices!
9980 2018-06-11 01:10:58 Look at you blowing things out of proportion and everything.  Where did I say that every single ship would spill? Again... You bring up other cities. Ones who can probably manage minor spills of FLOATING oil products successfully. They arent Vancouver. 
9981 2018-06-11 01:10:37 What A Wank!! Howard supported US desire for Oil and we all knew it!!
9982 2018-06-11 01:10:32 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
9983 2018-06-11 01:10:27 Benjamin Netanyahu just offered a truly extraordinary offer for the citizens of Iran....Water. Its the most precious resource in that region, not oil. The importance of clean drinking water is vital to any nation's survival. Especially, the children of that nation.

9985 2018-06-11 01:10:09 @USTreasury please end speculation on essential good like food and oil like it used to be to protect America family’s , low to middle class are effected the most by stock market speculation
9986 2018-06-11 01:09:53 First you have to diversify portfolio and not just oil. Lastly, you had barely educated talent and needed immigrants to fill it. Hence, the racist remarks and the whole trumpism is not going to go far in Canada. Fortunately, not everyone is a racist
9987 2018-06-11 01:09:53 Well Depends though because you believe that 10.5 $ / gallon of oil is an acceptable price I don’t have anything to speak of.
9988 2018-06-11 01:09:47 Yea. They're more efficient. They are getting better. But you're naive if you think companies wouldn't dump oil in rivers if it were legal. In fact, companies are now doing this in the US, because Trump made it legal

9991 2018-06-11 01:09:33 Isn't even that coal was/is mostly dead and oil and gas is lobby more powerful/slightly benefit from coal's death.

9996 2018-06-11 01:08:43 What's next, Trump reviving the flagging whale oil industry by reapproving whaling?
9997 2018-06-11 01:08:37 I wish I had some coconut oil right here to give myself a hot oil massage cuz my hair is looking like hay.
