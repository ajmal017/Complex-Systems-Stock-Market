Commodity firms get much less attention than banks as potential conduits for money laundering but the same potential is there. Like money, commodities have no smell.

4 2018-02-04 23:18:30 El aumento ahora de la pobreza en Argentina y Brasil se debe a medidas de austeridad (e.g. fuga de capitales, caída en exportaciones). Las economías en crisis, según su opinión, se debió a una caída en precios de commodities, en la falta de demanda en EEUU, Europa, y China.

12 2018-02-04 22:46:41 Hi John,

You're not naive. Those agreements do cause problems for you and me who would be curious to see the data, but they exist.

We can exert pressure on companies to NOT put those clauses in, but in the end they can always go to another researcher. We are commodities to them
13 2018-02-04 22:43:53 Do you need their FAKE indicators? Don't you buy FUEL or pay TRANSPORT FARES? Don't you buy food or spare parts? Are you not in Ghana? FACT is, PRICES of all COMMODITIES have shot up.
14 2018-02-04 22:41:09 $80 what year ? Hello $ I can see you .. Give me a strong till April will do havoc to commodities .. can't wait for Shanghai open .. Chinese New Year around the corner so cash will be drained out of the system as always..

16 2018-02-04 22:35:18 Don't you buy stuffs in Ghana? At least, don't you buy food? The FACT is that prices of ALL COMMODITIES have shot up big time. But the NPP apogees like Kofi Bentil @kbentil are refusing to see and these guys say they belong to civil society. When I hear them speak, I laugh.
17 2018-02-04 22:25:50 Acknowledged but yet to get my head around the demand side. Which taxed commodities have inelastic demand?
18 2018-02-04 22:11:00 In many cases their priorities are out of wack. People confuse commodities with necessities.  You seem to be of the same mindset.

38 2018-02-04 22:06:53 Opening calls for Sunday night. Corn  mixed, soybeans up 1 , wheat mixed.
USCommodities is in Argentina. The LaNina effect is real . Southern Brazil and Argentina are in a warm dry pattern. Rain is forecast for some of the driest areas Thursday/Friday/Saturday. No pattetn change.
39 2018-02-04 22:02:28 People who treat facts as nothing more than commodities to be re-formed & re-packaged to the public as truth are not public servants, they are public enemies. Trump feeds on evil & sells hatred.
40 2018-02-04 21:56:00 Typical extended fifths in commodities make them look 3 wave, Zac?
41 2018-02-04 21:54:00 Many commodities do tend to oscillate more in larger 3 wave patterns at very large degrees, but with that there are normal impulsive structures where one would expect.
42 2018-02-04 21:36:46 $ prices Commodities will do very well when dollar slides & inflation reigns king. Perhaps their price strength will reflect dollar weakness as opposed to commod strength to start but certainly becomes self fulfilling if it lasts long enough
43 2018-02-04 21:33:19 Equities markets overstepping their means, forces markets into commodities for fear of bag holding. That’s the public markets. (I think?)

If the government is ABCequity then Crypto is precious metals?
44 2018-02-04 21:28:52 Big support is really in the mid $16s. 

One thing to watch is the $USD. If you see ANY price action in $DXY 87s... commodities and related miners are going to launch upward.
45 2018-02-04 21:15:17 You ever hear of commodities? No cash flows...doesn’t make its value worthless. Take a look at the market cap of commodities
46 2018-02-04 21:13:09 Watching soft commodities closely this week; London Cocoa & Coffee Arabica my two to watch
47 2018-02-04 21:11:50 Where do we start with Zim. Wow. Well let's just say we are knee deep in it right now.  Not a single law repealed YET by our new president. Plenty of promises from him though. Plenty of cash shortages, still no drugs at hospitals. Basic commodities still overpriced.
48 2018-02-04 21:05:46 Going to invest it. Maybe trade some commodities or get involved in the cryptocurrencies trends. I was thinking of flipping some real estate also. Thanks for asking.
49 2018-02-04 20:50:37 I just want to see more disillusioned millionaire boomer chads decide to end it all with a bang.  My life won't be complete until we see some commodities trader get burned out on Jackson Hole and decide take out a dam with his Gulfstream.
50 2018-02-04 20:49:15 Agree on the Under 48.5. Think this going to be more of a Def game than LY.
Def making a comeback in both NFL/CFB. Pts per game down over past few yrs. Sad for Wentz-think he's next great QB. Also a great guy off-field. Enjoy your party-back to Commodities tomorrow-lol!
51 2018-02-04 20:46:58 Selves about the ways we perpetuate what we have been taught. One of those ways is in this psychologically embedded narrative that children are burdens, or commodities. Lack of parental/childhood love is causing toxic adults in our community. Toxic adults are not functional
52 2018-02-04 20:43:58 Under capitalism our lives become commodities to be bought, sold and rented, with a #BasicIncome at least we have the capacity to refuse to sell
53 2018-02-04 20:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
54 2018-02-04 20:36:05 Peor aun, meterse en casa ajena siempre es pa llevar agua a su molino. En este caso, commodities.
55 2018-02-04 20:34:33 Water will be one of the top commodities in the very near future.
Getting more and more privatised.
56 2018-02-04 20:26:36 Climate change,adverse weather conditions  and human conflict in agricultural areas are expected to lead to crop failures hence the price of agricultural commodities are set to rise in 2018.
57 2018-02-04 20:22:25 There's no question about this fact. I lived for decades,watching our Federal and State Governments,deliberately destroy Our Democracy. This Cabal,enslaved the entire American Population. How? Inflated taxes,energy

60 2018-02-04 19:58:37 That shipment doesn't fall within a violation as defined in the words on the paper. It has nothing to do with enforcement. The sanctions are against companies, not commodities. The French company is absolutely using that to their advantage, and will continue to. It's 100% legal.
61 2018-02-04 19:47:30 Diesel has steadily been going up at pumps. We've had record freight rates past 6 months to move commodities. Wait for those price increases at your local grocery store.

65 2018-02-04 19:26:32 I'd just call it consolidation/churn. $WTIC is broadly strong, already close to psy' $70.  Arguably the worse trade into the spring would be short commodities. I'd refer anyone to the $CRB

68 2018-02-04 19:03:02 North Korea is flouting sanctions by exporting coal, iron, steel and other banned commodities, earning nearly $200 million in revenue last year.
69 2018-02-04 19:00:19 So women are to blame for prostitution? But the males that perpetuate an economic system to insure a female class "chooses" it, and proceed to buy women as commodities for boner servicing, are not at fault. #manlogicks

73 2018-02-04 18:36:28 Very true about the "good test."   I don't think there is a good handle on inflation.  Different types on inflation.   Labor, commodities, assets, exchange rates, etc..
74 2018-02-04 18:35:59 Do these same institutions allow you to buy stocks/bonds/commodities on their credit cards? (Serious q - I don’t know the answer)
75 2018-02-04 18:24:46 It's been a long time we have not seen all asset class came under selling pressure at the same time since 2008. #stocks #bonds #commodities #currencies were sold last Friday. Let's see if this pressure will continue next week.
76 2018-02-04 18:22:35 E naturalmente nunca entenderão porque continuamos exportando commodities mesmo com proteção à indústria!

78 2018-02-04 18:19:24 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Any of y'all notice that the price of canned goods, generally consumable commodities, that were adjusted in quantity to make up for the $5.00 a gallon gasoline, haven't gone down in price or regained quantity?
79 2018-02-04 18:18:23 Esta demostrado que eso no es más que wishful thinking. SQM lo exportará a China, el estado sacara sus impuestos y seremos igual de dependientes de los commodities sin agregar valor.
80 2018-02-04 18:15:07 I find it interesting even though im not a stock guy. It seems the hot commodities fall the hardest
81 2018-02-04 18:05:03 Usar o argumento "ou você é a favor de proteção para a indústria ou quer que o Brasil exporte commodities" dá conta da honestidade intelectual do(a) autor(a).
82 2018-02-04 18:02:52 any chance the equities rally is similar in nature?  or replace commodities with 'investment assets'?   would a dollar rally be a headwind for USA investment assets in general?
83 2018-02-04 18:02:16 Wrap:
Solid US #NFP headline and a surge in wage growth prompt focus on interest rates, sending USD and Treasury yields higher at the expense of equities; Dow sees largest points fall since GFC; NZD and commodities stumble on #Greenback strength.
84 2018-02-04 17:59:23 Healthy disrespect for commodities I guess. 
85 2018-02-04 17:56:36 Not really imho - inflation has always underestimated the devaluation of the dollar so I would prefer to buy commodities as a hedge.
86 2018-02-04 17:55:49 we are talking about the difference between fiat and commodity currencies. dollars, et al, can be expanded at will, without cost. this is not the case for gold, BTC, and other commodities. if you don't recognize commodity currencies as useful, we are not likely to find agreement
87 2018-02-04 17:32:38 New Release! Some of the news: Better UI for sector view map and a new "hyperjump planner", commodities have descriptions, military drive SFX, fixed S&R-missions crashing
88 2018-02-04 17:26:39 The current bitcoin situation is an opportunity, I love crashes, commodities goes down in price.
89 2018-02-04 17:22:21 Still time to board the train in my opinion the market cap of all cryptocurrency will become larger than all the stock markets combined because the utility goes far beyond currency, commodities and equities ..
90 2018-02-04 17:16:17 No thats fine. I don't lie about anything, I am a large shareholder in $Fat, $lac, & $ml, those are my big 3. I cannot stand when ppl throw out ideas, then the less educated in the area, run away w/ a topic. Market is in a tizzy, Buying WV commodities right now will reap rewards.
91 2018-02-04 17:06:17 Commodities are the opium of the people.
92 2018-02-04 17:01:19 Who serves to them? Who brings expensive clothes from Bangladesh to London? Who goes to kill innocent people in Middle East for labour power and precious commodities? No one wants to know. No one cares. As long as brothels are full of prostitutes and stores full of food all is OK
93 2018-02-04 16:57:44 The APC led government has only succeeded in escalating poverty amongst the downtrodden. Food prices and other commodities have doubled since it came on board.
94 2018-02-04 16:52:48 Also, wait for the weekly ADX to start pointing up And above 30, that's is when a real strong trend will start and one can just "sit" and not trade. Also, make sure that PM's are starting to outperform other commodities such as Agriculture, oil, Base Metals. That is the ripe time
95 2018-02-04 16:52:28 mate it has nothing to do with decentralization, I would appreciate it if you didn't just toss the word around as I doubt you understand it in the proper context.

It has to do with lines of credit for extremely risky commodities purchasing that didn't exist when terms we're made
96 2018-02-04 16:49:48 My answer would be it is hard to tell. The environment suggests that commodities are/will do well over the next period of time (months,years?). I would suggest that if one decides to buy metals make sure it's silver and not gold as uptrends in PM's have silver leading....
97 2018-02-04 16:19:23 Talal & Danial are disposable commodities. Such type of characters are easily available and purchasable in political arena of Pak. These are worthless ppl who can do anything and go to any extent for pol gains but can’t spend two nights in jail.
98 2018-02-04 16:12:21 @eikebatista  nos preços de commodities no final de 2015 e início de 2016, a AA procurou vender uma grande parte de seus ativos, dizendo que se concentraria em cobre, diamantes e platina. Conforme os mercados de commodities se recuperaram, no entanto, a pressão de venda diminuiu.
99 2018-02-04 16:11:41 Honestly even though I had a dream to help someone deprived to get a roof over his/her head I couldn't been able to due to lack of essential commodities but have donated clothes for the needful many a times. #ShelterForTheHomeless

 #poetry #science
101 2018-02-04 15:38:15 @PeterSchiff Your recent broadcast, I 100%AGREE. BUT you forget to mention that the inflation from debt services COMPOUNDS thru the economy. RAW goods to FINISHED product pass on costs to next stage producer. Commodities will experience the lowest cost increase vs high tech
102 2018-02-04 15:37:51 My suspicion is that we price organic commodities incorrectly (too cheaply) because we only pay for the material use, not for the non-use (biowaste of any kind) and the displacement (incremental dispossession of the user of the soil).
103 2018-02-04 15:37:18 Remember invasion of Iraq and they were no threat? The biggest atrocity of Women and Kids for the purpose of stealing commodities and gaining control of Middle East - all proven lies. Now are we telling the TRUTH?
104 2018-02-04 15:32:21 Subsidies on essential commodities and loans were outcome of Indira ji’s “Gareebi hataao” slogan. She in a very systematic way provided subsidised loans for cottage and small scale industries unlike Modi who with gst and demonetisation almost ruined all !!
105 2018-02-04 15:29:41 African countries must also add value to their commodities by producing manufactured & processed products & begin to trade with one another.
106 2018-02-04 15:19:48 O "sucesso" do seu governo se é que assim pode-se chamar, não possui influencia alguma sua. O preços das Commodities e outros fatores externos deram ao povo a falsa sensação de progresso, oque veio abaixo nos próximos anos.
107 2018-02-04 15:19:39 A China querendo nos manter eternos fornecedores de commodities a baixos preços.
108 2018-02-04 15:19:13 Anyway I would love to run a similar analysis on the transfer of organic matter vis-a-vis market distribution of organic commodities
109 2018-02-04 15:19:05 I'm particularly 'fond' of the 'special requests' I get from men in a certain geographic region where their own women are treated like commodities ... but somehow think Western women will go mad to have sex with them.
110 2018-02-04 15:16:45 Prices, exchanges and bourses of African commodities are set in industrial countries. African countries have no say in their own commodities
111 2018-02-04 15:15:36 Nope. Provision of essential commodities like water should, always remain the competence of government. This current crisis is an indictment on everyone, including City of Cape Town on poor planning. I believe in capacitating government, privatization calls are knee-jerk reaction

115 2018-02-04 14:41:51 Jealousy and athlete envy is a big part of it. It’s the dark side of sports fandom. People are so emotionally invested in their teams they see athletes (even young ones) as commodities and not humans with the same vulnerabilities they have..
116 2018-02-04 14:41:40 The US dollar is accepted globally all over the world which is why tourists prefer to travel with it. Every country (inc. the Uk) keeps a large percentage of their foreign reserve in the dollar. Commodities also have their unit price in dollars as well. Such as gold oil etc

120 2018-02-04 14:33:53 As an adoptive parent this is infuriating.  Children are not commodities to be passed around.  We must act in their best interests and have more not less protection and oversight of foster care placements

124 2018-02-04 13:58:29 In the recent Budget, the BJP Govt. has not done any thing for the middle class,
by which they lost in Rajasthan. Reduce the Prizes of Petrol and Diesel to lessen the prizes of commodities and this may lead next 5 yrs.extension to BJP. A well wisher.

126 2018-02-04 13:52:19 And in addition, plant farming bypasses the ethical questions associated with treating living, breathing, thinking, feeling creatures like pieces of property and commodities to be used, profited from and violently disposed of when no longer useful.

130 2018-02-04 13:07:43 Laughing should our daily do's somehow like our commodities, without it perhaps its such a life wasted
131 2018-02-04 13:01:03 Most definitely. Expecting a massive move into commodities soon. Stocks are going to slide. Bond market and dollar going down.
132 2018-02-04 12:57:44 Individualism is killing Uganda. Even couples cannot do business together. You find them engaging in similar businesses separately – husband and wife owning separate kiosks selling similar commodities.
133 2018-02-04 12:56:28 As production of 'ordinary' commodities becomes ever more efficient   through labour-saving technology, it's very convenient that consumers seem to develop a taste for more & more 'bespoke' & 'artisanal' products & other euphemisms for labour-intensive self-indulgent shit.
134 2018-02-04 12:49:12 All markets have a varying degree of sentiment.

The average car only contains several thousand dollars worth of base commodities but we view cars as the most important aspect to freedom.

Crypto promises even great er freedom.

135 2018-02-04 12:48:31 Watching Altered Carbon. Getting really tired of the dead sex worker trope in fiction. It's so common it's exhausting. Dystopia where the most dangerous job is commodities trading please.
136 2018-02-04 12:39:59 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
137 2018-02-04 12:22:13 Prefer residents, customers are commodities these days
138 2018-02-04 12:05:44 People are quick to call 2008. But in a liquidity crisis everything goes down. Commodities like crude and gold cratered for about 6-8 months. Sell what's liquid.
139 2018-02-04 12:00:47 Oh really - The Fed can only raise interest rates and, guess what, that comes after a time lag.  The $ is the most important thing when it comes to inflation as it controls the price of commodities and, by association input costs. When the Fed then raises rates to combat
140 2018-02-04 11:59:37 @arunjaitley  your budget looks good in paper but should be put in practical way ,just to reduce prices you can't import commodities,it affects the farmers,please get the basics right first,let focus be towards rural areas and pay less attention to urban areas

143 2018-02-04 11:47:53 Latin America’s exports to China increased by around 30% last year, according to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), mainly because of an increase in the price of South American oil, minerals and other commodities.
144 2018-02-04 11:47:16 Justice and equity are expensive commodities yet too cheap. If formal justice is a preserve of the wealthy, the poor will deploy informal justice. When orchestrating impunity, the people the other side have ability to fight back, that is what we all forget

147 2018-02-04 10:53:01 What is meaning of Markets going up or down? 
To me it is if Sensex/Nifty go up the market prices of commodities/services/all type of machinery &other day to day things will also go up because profits of those big companies will up but prices will go down if share markets go down
148 2018-02-04 10:45:12 The trend is down , get out.
Trade commodities only(stocks,etfs, etc in this sector are good also)
149 2018-02-04 10:43:04 For the first time since 1980 to see prices of commodities going down, for sure Robert is gone!

151 2018-02-04 10:14:58 Apartheid debt should have been written off if IMF and other bodies could have written off debts incurred by the poorest nations in 2005.
Cannot see why they were holding SA to odious debt if not to control the country as it is rich in precious commodities.

153 2018-02-04 09:43:29 We need an alternative entry gateway to crypto rather than fiat. We need a platform where commodities and services can be exchanged directly with crypto. This will encourage more people to enter crypto world and prevent banks from choking crypto by closing the fiat gateway.
154 2018-02-04 09:39:22 I agree. Commodities have to join the party for it to be 2008

171 2018-02-04 06:53:04 Most of the times oil and other commodities move in tandem. A lot of it is demand and financial flow driven as well

183 2018-02-04 05:15:47 Well ... in certain sectors such as manufacturing, yes. However, if you're a business that relies on imports, commodities or transportation - not as much. Even in the case of manufacturing and exports, there is a stigma attached to US products so it's a trade-off.

192 2018-02-04 04:15:21 As an adoptive parent this is infuriating.  Children are not commodities to be passed around.  We must act in their best interests and have more not less protection and oversight of foster care placements
193 2018-02-04 04:13:22 I grew up on food stamps in the 70s. Raised by my grandparents.  We got the old government commodities too. They retired from the fruit package house. No retirement then.

195 2018-02-04 03:46:11 Gundlach didn’t sound bullish to me.  Expressed caution, rates higher, equities sell to pay down debt, commodities should outperform equities 8x as they have prior to every other recession was his drumbeat.
196 2018-02-04 03:41:31 I think mike you could see even a bigger gift if the market along with commodities pullback in next two months. I added to fission and uec yesterday. Fcuuf at .54 and uec 1.47 but still underwater on those

212 2018-02-04 01:35:38 Me and you are going to agree. just to acknowledge a few thing first, downturn in ag commodities means less overall turnover and consequently reduction in total offered in GDP, subsidies are based on European currency from Brussels hence when the slide in the valuation of 1/3

214 2018-02-04 01:31:36 It's interesting and good that in the US the three maybe most important 'commodities' food water and INFORMATION are among the least expensive
215 2018-02-04 01:30:01 Interest last year on debt(450 billion) 3% of budget(more than many programs) , & rising - CB/Fed/Govt/Banks can't control everything (e.g. Black Swan), dollar drop, commodities rising (oil up 20%, natural gas 20% in January ) Trump aka Hoover owns it- like you -fearful of war

217 2018-02-04 01:18:58 If cash and bonds are not safe then you and I have far bigger problems than retirement. I spend zero time worrying abut that. I don't buy commodities since it is all trend and not my game anyway. #2 is a fact, so I favor the Aussie/Singapore approach.
218 2018-02-04 01:04:36 The dynamics of economic management is constantly changing, whilst we’re still stuck in the colonial economy mentality (dependence on raw materials/ commodities in national income), which is very saddening and asserts that things are going to get worse.
219 2018-02-04 01:02:00 It'll keep moving up as until demand falls off enough to stop the draws. Not the equities - no modeled "value" in commodities.  It'll accelerate as the tanks get emptier at pricing points.

255 2018-02-03 21:01:14 yes, I'm afraid so. Working in the field of selling the ideology that sells the commodities couldn't be anything other than rank. Rank.
256 2018-02-03 20:58:35 Ah yes, had read that margins had reached a bit of a peaks in some commodities trading.
257 2018-02-03 20:54:30 The rich have an inclination to inflate commodities rather than to circulate their money.

259 2018-02-03 20:52:39 Two assumptions there:
1) Non-equity investments (cash, bonds, commodities, etc) are "safe"
2) People will manage their portfolios "correctly"

Given the research I've see on 401k participation and management rates #2 is highly dubious. #1 is at least debatable.
260 2018-02-03 20:41:00 Okay what happens to their debt? Impacts on commodities, in particular Aussie?
261 2018-02-03 20:25:03 So I'm getting rid of all illiquid commodities (on an intraday basis) from my scans, namely: lumber, ethanol, rough rice, oats, milk and orange juice
262 2018-02-03 20:24:37 Thanks! And yes, prosthetics as excess...also which ones and excess of what for whom? The capitalist technofetish imaginary that makes prosthetics (but not disability) desirable (and expensive) commodities also produces its Other. I call it the bionic and the biodeficient.
263 2018-02-03 20:21:42 Obrigação de exportar?? Reposição de estoque? Commodities? Don't ask difficult questions!
264 2018-02-03 20:21:28 In order for suppliers to meet and "win" (competition) demand, they will invest in increasing supply (building more infrastructure) while also investing in R&D. This is generally how all other commodities played out in history. The natural gravitation of prices always near 0.

268 2018-02-03 20:13:10 Yep, that I shouldn't trade commodities that are too illiquid on an intraday-basis. My risk is essentially unmanagable even though the daily charts look docile enough.
269 2018-02-03 20:09:19 I’d consider commodities, gold mainly.  Correction is coming pronto.
270 2018-02-03 20:07:26 But beside Alloy's reserve plans, what other use cases would it offer, to separate itself from the thousands of other altcoins out there?

272 2018-02-03 20:04:26 Using native images as mascots is extremely detrimental. It continues the practice of subjugation. That people can be bought and sold, appropriated and traded. It reinforces the practice of bodies as commodities instead of people to be respected and valued. #NQSoc221

We are not trick ponies or commodities that need to be put on display. Have some respect.
295 2018-02-03 17:53:36 Yes, unfortunately the pound has recovered against the dollar to pre-referendum levels.
Note to @PeterTu51472302
The dollar is the world reserve currency & commodities, oil, wheat etc are priced in dollars, so pound versus the dollar is ratio to watch for economic performance.

381 2018-02-03 07:37:03 If interest rates are raised, I think every one should prepare for 2X the normal reaction. Markets have been ignoring WAY too much. Again they've ignored commodities which are not doing good. When the stock market runs ahead of commodities, things are about to go south.
382 2018-02-03 07:35:04 Surely the main point is who bought these commodities in violation of sanctions.

384 2018-02-03 07:31:40 Instead of solving problems like fuel price hike, price hike of basis commodities, unemployment, inceresing crime against women and children, fringe violence and taxation, all these problems have infact become more with the modi government. But Modi is busy with his touring.
385 2018-02-03 07:17:24 Commodities stocks will follow commodity cycle and probably limited room downward from base?  Unless commodities go down?
386 2018-02-03 07:15:29 That would require maturity and common sense. Both are very scarce commodities in some quarters.
387 2018-02-03 07:12:25 one side the people of India says the prices of commodities have gone up on the other hand government wants to double the income of farmers . Then  govt have to increase the MSP or to give benefit in some other schemes/ policies to push the income of farmers.
388 2018-02-03 07:08:16 Who're the dimwits who thought that new taxes won't affect the prices of ALL commodities. You can't make wishful thinking part of your economic policy.
389 2018-02-03 06:34:12 #bitcoin I wonder if the FISA memo drama will affect crypto, commodities, stock and bond market.
390 2018-02-03 06:31:05 North Korea earned nearly $200m (141m) last year by exporting banned commodities in breach of international sanctions, a UN report says.
391 2018-02-03 06:15:58 Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018, an analyst who correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's rally at the start of last year told CNBC
Let's look forward to 2018 greatest challenge let's use Bitcoin for big things like Commodities real estate and buying and selling crude oil
392 2018-02-03 06:01:49 "If then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities, they have only one common property left, that of being products of labour."

The rest of Ch. 1 follows from there.
393 2018-02-03 05:59:06 Here's Marx again:
"The exchange of commodities is...characterised by a total abstraction from use value...
As use values, commodities are...of different qualities, but as exchange values they are merely different quantities, and consequently do not contain an atom of use value."
394 2018-02-03 05:56:31 But value, as a social relation under capitalism, is only tangentially related to use-value, insofar as commodities as useful things are "the material depositories of exchange value."  A particular commodity has a use to someone, but for value that particular use doesn't matter.
395 2018-02-03 05:44:35 toor dal is a funny reference point. I too voted for bjp sir. But I have seen the spikes in vegetables & commodities under Modi too. To save a few rupees on toor dal I will not pay out much more on taxes to keep Modi in power.
396 2018-02-03 05:36:52 @porinju  dear porinju, do you agree that ltcg will take markets more down to say 10000 levels. US bond yield and dollar one day pullback took down dow by 660 points. Isnt rising dollar index better as commodities will cool off. Indian bond yields will also
397 2018-02-03 05:35:04 Will go much deeper. But it's certainly possible. We've had a 32% run up in the last year. For one year, that's pretty steep. I see equities higher, commodities 4 - 7 months higher. I think treasuries will hold steady pretty low for the next year....
398 2018-02-03 05:26:30 our so called secular politicians &political parties should stop pandering to radical elements within d Muslim community just for votes as it threatens society in India at large besides pushing Indian Muslims in2 d arms of hardliners who treat women as commodities as in this case
399 2018-02-03 05:24:48 let the hedging begin and the commodities rise coming into the new year with high hopes for some mining ops
400 2018-02-03 05:24:48 I read an article today of some commodities guy in the UK saying BC will hit $50k by the end of this year, I can’t remember who wrote it...
401 2018-02-03 05:22:45 Women are not commodities. This is something which is not acceptable. There is no necessary to change after marriage. #ChangeHerNot
402 2018-02-03 05:22:37 There's nothing metaphysical about it. In order to be exchanged commodities must have a use-value, and in order to be produced commodities must have an exchange-value. Both production and exchange are rooted in abstract human labor; human labor-power expended in production.
403 2018-02-03 05:18:12 hard days of demonitization and GST gestation period

406 2018-02-03 05:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

Having fun with social experiments.
408 2018-02-03 04:49:21 watching that trailer made the tanaka's amazing commodities song stuck in my head
409 2018-02-03 04:46:39 Commodities  are a low yield investment and unattractive in a vibrant economy, but become a safe haven in a collapsed economy because  they have real value. Would it not make sense to ad a healthy dose of commodity to a portfolio in good times to stabilize these swings?
410 2018-02-03 04:46:21 @Williamsruto the rise of prices for basic commodities is wanting.  kindly, address it

412 2018-02-03 04:35:58 Las estimaciones del barril del Brent llegan a picos de 80 dólares. La correlación de precios gas - crudo en los últimos 6 meses es de 0,93. Se puede estimar un aumento de los presupuestos militares y de las tensiones en zonas donde esos commodities tienen gran preponderancia.
413 2018-02-03 04:35:04 I think it is more the end of all fiat currency and the reinventing of backed currency. I think in the end it bid well for silver and gold or really any commodities that don't have a shelf life. IMHO.
414 2018-02-03 04:33:25 Melbourne putting an exhibition yet again mate. How anyone wins money down there is beyond me. So many heavily backed commodities get rolled day in day out.
415 2018-02-03 04:19:38 Does it bother anyone knowing that hardened and psychopathic murderers that are in prison have it better than some homeless veterans with mental disabilities? Free food, water, a place to sleep and other commodities

432 2018-02-03 01:50:28 El 'auge' de la década pasada se explica por el boom de commodities, cierta mejora distributiva, las bajas tasas de interés internacionales, etc. Como en todos lados...
433 2018-02-03 01:49:03 Insects are our main competitors for food, and we lose 10-30% of our crops to them after commodities are harvested. This video is from a potential alternative fumigant that is much more environmentally sustainable to produce and non-toxic to humans. So, it's all for a good cause.
434 2018-02-03 01:46:11 Its not sexual misconduct. Its more than that. Its an ideological framework, where women's role is to procreate, and be tradeable commodities. Its requires more than criminal law to solve it.
435 2018-02-03 01:45:13 You aren't that crazy lol. Bitcoin acts as a digital commodity imo so looking at the crude oil vs s&p chart I can easily see a scenario where bitcoin trades inversely just like other commodities when volatility strikes equities.
436 2018-02-03 01:25:28 Seems to react to sentiment and rumour more than forex, stocks and commodities. FUD, whatever that means :)
437 2018-02-03 01:25:13 You know what sketches me most? Pallets if they’re from production facilities are non-standardized reusable commodities. It could hold cat litter one day, primal cuts of raw meat the next. Very little regulation, no sanitization. So pallet projects in the home? NOPE. Hard pass.

445 2018-02-03 00:35:32 My Lord God Jesus Christ was a Palestinian. The only thing you indigenous native Palestinians have exported successfully is local competing currencies based off of reserved commodities to oppose the money changers and Christianity.
446 2018-02-03 00:33:28 Idk I just have a good feeling bout this downturn for cryptos.

As I mentioned earlier if prices of  commodities drop so does prices of crypto.look at the similarities..

It's highly volatile.
On the other hand..god know when it touches the support level,How high it can be.

447 2018-02-03 00:30:25 On "What impact do you think Brexit will have on your personal finances?" 49% believe "None". Work to be done explaining what a closed economy does to the cost of imported products and commodities, healthcare and energy, and on pensions and wages. Ouch!

449 2018-02-03 00:28:20 Soon cannabis genetics could be categorized like other commercial horticulture crop commodities, but I don't like the whole renaming of genetics other breeders had worked with under bm. Weed out the bs genetic sources and maintain transparency with your culture of consumers
450 2018-02-03 00:26:54 I think in the NBA, the most valuable commodities, in order, are 1. the players who do many things at an elite level, 2. do everything at least above average, & 3. players elite at a few things at one end. That’s Willy. A smart team will figure out how to use him.
451 2018-02-03 00:21:12 This so much a massive step from the Chinese thinking animals were just commodities not loving companions and friends amazing thank you
452 2018-02-03 00:20:48 They underestimated #WonderWoman too. Obviously, women and minorities are still not considered profitable commodities unless sold off like cattle. Hollywood has so much growing up to do. This pisses me off to no end.
453 2018-02-03 00:17:34 Another fun fact. Foreign coffee was taxed nearly 8 times more than British coffee which was also taxed more than tea. The entire issue was on Britain monopolizing commodities by overtaxing its competiton
454 2018-02-03 00:11:05 Ancapism, I can accept money or not. Commodities have more value, paper money is created by the state. Communists always seem to want welfare. In Ancapism you can do whatever you want as long as it doesn't violate NAP or you gonna get shot.
455 2018-02-03 00:08:15 had some commodities (SID, IPI, CLD) and some medicals and all just kept breaking through supports . . . gonna wait on oil n metals to settle
456 2018-02-03 00:08:02 LOL GST has Reduced Prices of Most of the Daily Commodities. Inflation well under 3-4% which is much better during BJP.

496 2018-02-02 21:52:46 Please don’t let them do that. But do allow them private email servers, wheeling & dealing of commodities that shouldn’t be sold out for their high commission or is it another donation for the poor children that never see a cent.
497 2018-02-02 21:39:17 Oh...and gold down and commodities down. How could I forget? So something has to give. Its a matter of following the money..again, as I always say, let the charts lead the way. Not your brain ...you're not that smart. Well I know Im not that smart anyway.
498 2018-02-02 21:38:09 One of those very rare days when all asset classes got dumped.  Nowhere to hide but cash.
Commodities have broken out long term against stocks, though.  By dumping least.

501 2018-02-02 21:26:23 Sooo this is what happened today, because the market loves uncertainty (not) so everyone wants to be in cash!!

504 2018-02-02 21:12:40 4/ The secret is being right, obviously, and that is no guarantee.  The 2 secret is knowing when to jump out, too.  In commodities, what goes up... Fortunately, the foresight that had u notice the buy, will tell u the sell, too.  A lag in mkt recognition, at both ends!

A person’s value doesn’t come from economic, academic or creative output. From their talents or skills. People aren’t commodities.

513 2018-02-02 20:33:04 Pastors, let’s stop using or referring to relationships as if they are transactional commodities...trading one for another to gain a greater “return”. 

Love people, don’t leverage them.
514 2018-02-02 20:30:44 Commodities generally tend to be "sticky"  you have to consider specs vs. hedgers doing their battle thingy, and can take lots of time before one or the other capitulates;  patience required for sure . . .
515 2018-02-02 20:26:31 You could make the same argument about strippers and (some) prostitutes, nobody forces them to do it and it's their right to choose to do that job... but it's still objectification & sends the message that women are commodities to be purchased/used for entertainment.

518 2018-02-02 20:16:16 There's a much deeper discussion here about society's objectification of women and their being viewed as commodities only for their bodies.
519 2018-02-02 20:15:23 TY 1/2 In failing to copy @Goldiein604 I now send with ur background. Allowing rental units in #VANre #SFD with no #RPP planning assessment of the broader social & market impacts, & only costs to the city tactically assessed, is partly why homes are now such costly commodities;
520 2018-02-02 20:14:27 Problem is our economy worked around the easy option of using and creating low wage jobs providing a service island ie shopping,leisure and property wealth.instead of investing in high quality industrial areas like robotics,hardware commodities creating skilled high paid workers
521 2018-02-02 20:08:49 There's a dog, sheep, chickens and ducks at my family home. I don't think it would be right for me to treat any of them like production units or commodities to be used and disposed of when no longer profitable to me. I think their value exists independent of their utility to me.
522 2018-02-02 20:05:18 A dívida só ia aumentando p causa dos juros, não é atoa q os banqueiros tanto elogiaram a era do PT, acredite cara, dar dinheiro de mãos beijadas ao pobre q não trabalha faz ele depender disso e isso significa retrocesso amigo. Lula teve sorte q com os commodities importados..
523 2018-02-02 19:57:23 não tentarmos ao menos explicar que o governo lula não fez nenhum tipo de reforma estrutural no Brasil, viviamos um boom de commodities e a economia foi impulsionada por um ciclo de consumo populista e só.
524 2018-02-02 19:56:40 What about a person whose being seems to revolve around promoting an industry and attempting to boost sales for a product? Can I ask what makes this so much more noble than someone who doesn't want sentient beings to be treated like commodities and disposed of in slaughterhouses?

In dollar bear markets, you want to be long commodities, precious metals, & equities - specifically EM equities (1/3).

552 2018-02-02 18:12:27 I can’t escape thoughts on the tree. The Diamond v Chakrabarty case established the right to patent living organisms. Which makes them instead of works of nature into commodities. After the objectification of life what distinguishes it from any other rhetorical work? #ufdigrhet
553 2018-02-02 18:07:00 Markets are ugly. Sold nothing. I buy dogs & buy on corrections. Still massively long commodities - including nuclear for the past month.
554 2018-02-02 18:06:40 Information is the most fundamental commodity on Earth; all other commodities depend on it. So the controllers of the world's information traffic - Google, Facebook. and the rest - are the most powerful entities in the world.
555 2018-02-02 18:04:49 Something has happened this morning because countless stocks, not just cannabis stocks took a big hit before 10:30. $ACB $WEED $APH $TRST $CMED $LEAF all took hits, but so did $AAPL $EEM $GE $QQQ to name a few. All commodities bar gas are down too!
556 2018-02-02 18:00:36 The flaws in the system are the parts; people.  We complain about the greedy rich but we buy their products.  We get blasted with materialism, advertisements, and commodities because we give in to it. We create our own demons.
557 2018-02-02 17:59:02 But like it or not footballers are commodities just like houses.
558 2018-02-02 17:55:30 thanks, Kim. Agree that terminology needs to be tightened up. We'll take a run at that on @BNN's Commodities
559 2018-02-02 17:53:54 Yes, unfortunately where the gas came out of the ground is irrelevant to the sanctions. That's not how commodities and those sanctions work. They need to get more creative with their wording in the sanctions.
560 2018-02-02 17:37:17 This training hasn’t been all that bad, I’ve actually been able to grasp what bonds, commodities, equity derivatives, speed betting, futures and options are. I feel like a genius. Fuck capitalism though.
561 2018-02-02 17:36:22 Agreed.

567 2018-02-02 17:25:03 True. But those poor ppl whom you think also bears burden of indirect taxes, govt spends100 times more for them than then their contribution. Indirect tax is voluntarily paid while purchasing commodities but income tax is compulsorily paid on hard earning salary/business profits.

577 2018-02-02 16:51:47 I would also agree that there is no panic here. The media would probably go into panic mode if the stock market ended up with a sharp correction, but it says little about problems with the economy, which is still strong and suggests good demand for commodities.

583 2018-02-02 16:42:26 Fair point! Seen a few reports of a correction on the markets at some stage but I’ve also seen reports of a major bull cycle on commodities as well... wait and see I guess. Look for good value shares and trust in your research.

622 2018-02-02 14:51:59 Sanctions are against companies, not commodities. They were not written for a French company, and therefore, the French-owned LNG was legally dropped off by their FR ship. Complain all you like, but complain to the govt who should have written the sanctions to catch this.

732 2018-02-02 08:10:06 They will likely keep mining so long as they are making any profit.....just like other commodities. If BTC is under 2-3k they will start bleeding costs
733 2018-02-02 08:07:53 Goldman Sachs on Thursday touted its bullish overweight call on commodities, declaring the investment environment for the market as the best in a decade.

739 2018-02-02 07:52:38 There is real honest value in our stocks, seeing them sold off is nothing to do with the commodities, it is to do with short sighted people that know nothing about long term commitment, it’s not bitcoins, mining is the real deal.
740 2018-02-02 07:49:10 Dear @RailMinIndia, please avoid imposing restrictions for loading & ferrying essential commodities like wheat to southern states, when freight-traffic is high. Wheat is a basic necessity. @PiyushGoyal sir, please!

@CimGOI
741 2018-02-02 07:47:38 Point here is Peter is a technical charter that trades commodities.... I think BTC mining mirrors commodities. It would be interesting if my fundamental theory lines up with his technicals.

743 2018-02-02 07:33:01 I think we’d all agree that bits have, ah, *slightly* more information contained in them than grain or oil. They should not be spoken of as physical, but they definitely aren’t commodities. Access might become one, but never the data itself

749 2018-02-02 06:52:04 He is absolutely right and rally will be lead by Commodities / PSU banks

751 2018-02-02 06:49:24 no problem just give it to hillary to trade commodities for them.
752 2018-02-02 06:43:46 No changes in TAx slab in the budget 2018-19 is bitter for middle class people ,these people sustaining in metro cities by accompanying daily commodities is very difficult, people expected something from  budget but #Noresult @arunjaitley
753 2018-02-02 06:42:15 US commodities- Commodity Futures Trading Commission #CFTC is developing a "heightened review process" for #cryptocurrency futures though it will continue to allow exchanges to self-certify products
754 2018-02-02 06:40:16 absolutely true, but regulations implemented after dodd-frank (and only put into effective use in the last year or so) basically 'closed the gaps' in CFTC oversight of commodities transactions - not just those of registrants or with underlying derivatives markets

756 2018-02-02 06:28:05 The police was chasing one of their cars with their commodities early in the morning two weeks ago when the car lost control, crashed and burnt every one inside including a pregnant passerby to ashes.
Then the police was blamed for chasing the car too vigorously.

760 2018-02-02 05:44:06 Even on MSP, the Govt cant adopt Swaminathan Formula of C2 + 50% coz that will lead maximum spike in Inflation on other commodities as well. It will adopt A2+FL+50% which will be less than or almost equal to MSP farmers are already getting.
761 2018-02-02 05:00:02 Commodities: Rubber +2.84%, Natural gas +1.47%

766 2018-02-02 04:36:20 Commodities are the opium of the people.
767 2018-02-02 04:20:01 MM is wiser than AJ. Budget is not going to help any section of the society.Prices are increasing on almost all commodities.Hike in petrol,diesel means everything gets costly.where is the relief?
768 2018-02-02 04:19:53 Communism is a classless, stateless society. The idea of a bureaucratic monopoly redistributing commodities is a perversion of Marxism and socialism that was adopted by the Stalinist regimes and his descendants to justify an imperialist expansion with a leftist façade.
769 2018-02-02 04:17:09 Production for utility instead of commodities for starters, besides the overthrow of the system itself. Exchange for value equating to labor. Just some ideas.
770 2018-02-02 04:14:52 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.

774 2018-02-02 03:34:19 Personal responsibility is the ideal outcome?

That's precisely why the best way to let people address their responsible use of drugs is giving them liberty + education. Attempts at prohibiting global commodities are counter-productive. The failed Drug War backs this up.
775 2018-02-02 03:33:29 GST in high slab is a collective  open loot from public it be 3% on commodities.
776 2018-02-02 03:26:48 Let's see PTI lodge a protest against this persistent price hike of petroleum products hence of essential commodities as well
777 2018-02-02 03:24:35 Well there is a list of basic commodities that are hiked:
Vegetables
fruits
Perfumes

etc etc.
List of commodities that become cheaper:

780 2018-02-02 03:15:56 Exiting 3/4 of your positions at market tops followed by reallocating to other sectors such as commodities while the consolidation takes place allows you to keep money in use other than dead money. Then repurchase down the road & still be averaged in lower than repurchase price.
781 2018-02-02 03:14:18 @narendramodi @arunjaitley Sir After implementation of GSTDemon,essential commodities prices, vegetables,RE prices crumbling is sufficient
782 2018-02-02 03:11:16 So all these years the budget wasn’t for India?
Are you fools to say that or making fools out of ppl?
Medical expenses and transportation expenses are rising day to day, so are the prices of everyday commodities and you give only 40k std deduction? No change in tax slabs 
783 2018-02-02 03:10:34 Hon pm pl give entry in essential commodities such as ALOO. Tamatator, PYAJ ,sugar due low price ,the farmers are not getting production cost secondly market prices and selling prices have a lot differences on the print items due to which consumers are suffering
784 2018-02-02 03:04:04 @NewIndianXpress After implementation of GSTDemon,essential commodities prices, vegetables, RE prices crumbling is sufficient.
785 2018-02-02 03:01:30 I do not understand why all perishable commodities are not exempted from #ewaybill . If problem arise who will bear the loss government???
786 2018-02-02 02:59:03 Instead of paying for the labour, he only pays the value of commodities attained at the most a form independent of their use-values, i.
787 2018-02-02 02:56:13 Happens almost every crash. The dollar dives, stocks and commodities rocket then the economy crashes
788 2018-02-02 02:55:50 So an ETF can be a portfolio of stocks, commodities, derivative etc that investors can buy units in via an exchange. The $LIT ETF can be bought on the NYSE for $36.89 per unit.
789 2018-02-02 02:54:13 Salary of politicians got doubled, and one more tax added for middle class tax payer. Also many basic commodities got expensive.
790 2018-02-02 02:53:51 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @arunjaitley @GST_Council .Atleast dont cover perishable commodities in eway bill it is resulting in huge loss.

792 2018-02-02 02:48:07 I think that's why he replied by saying 'I'll kick her face'. Pimps don't view women as human beings, just commodities for sale. Jewish religious people wouldn't let @orenhazan wipe their floors. He is considered a pariah & honestly they wouldn't let him sit on their door steps.

795 2018-02-02 02:31:16 I was just trying to convey that the falling dollar shouldn't be a reason alone for a rise in commodities like gold and silver. There's a lot of money moving around right now and financial instruments are manipulating each other. Things are not 1:1 inversely correlated.

798 2018-02-02 02:12:58 capitalism understands this; this is why we have commodities that extend the narcissistic self, capitalizing on the desire to be desired
799 2018-02-02 02:12:42 Rape and sexual assault aren't commodities or prizes there is no women in this world that would ever use either of the two as their own personal bargaining chips in order to receive a financial windfall.

803 2018-02-02 01:54:29 For what? Money is a placeholder for time, services, or other commodities. If you don’t have money you aren’t making whatever it is that you need to do a priority. Nothing is impossible, just some things are bigger priorities than others.

809 2018-02-02 01:33:16 Capitalism is no more of a science than Catholicism. The static nature of Newtonian Price Theory requires a belief system-there are flaws-it is not utopia.

812 2018-02-02 01:26:57 You're exactly right, that's why I stated it as a question. We throw away people who get caught up in the legal system and they become commodities used to produce corporate profits.
813 2018-02-02 01:16:07 Could’ve explained capitalism and commodities with lectures and quizzes, but we make it memorable with stories instead.
814 2018-02-02 00:57:22 That was the underlying meaning of my question. Prisons, the School to prison pipeline, even the lack of reintegration once sentences are served are meant to corner  the convicted and keep their bodies as commodities.

825 2018-02-02 00:08:18 I was shocked to find out how truly inhumane it is. Dairy is an industry & the animals are treated as commodities, like some inanimate object.
