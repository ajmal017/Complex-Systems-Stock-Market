55 2018-07-02 23:53:41 I agree with all except 2. no seed oils, Nigella Sativa oil (black seed oil) saved my life from horrible colon issues , lots of red meat. Nope! I don't touch meat, it has too many chemicals and additives and it causes cancer, if you must eat red meat, buy the cow and do the work!

59 2018-07-02 23:52:48 It all matters, lol.  However, 'Cracks' just tell you whether or not it's profitable to refine oil....
60 2018-07-02 23:52:42 can we bring back burning at the stake or boiling oil for this sub human garbage
61 2018-07-02 23:52:39 Lol. In bed with Saudis?!? Welcome to America since we found oil there, Cher. I hope you find peace, you seem distressed.
62 2018-07-02 23:52:39 Chances are, Trump admires him for his ability to simultaneously loot & pillage the Treasury for his & his family’s benefit and systematically destroy every effort to preserve/maintain clean air, water & land. Oh, and enrich all the oil/gas big dogs.
63 2018-07-02 23:52:33 Vegetable oil maybe
64 2018-07-02 23:52:31 i just spilled burning hot oil on my thigh

66 2018-07-02 23:52:27 the best way to tell the temperature in my room is by the state of my coconut oil. we have yet to reach full liquid
67 2018-07-02 23:52:27 Medical marijuana is a good thing. Consistency and composition guaranteed, CBD component used to treat seizures, control pain, reduce swelling. Concentrated oil can be injected or put into food, no need to smoke. THC is the component that gives the "high" and what stoners want.
68 2018-07-02 23:52:26 I lost my father in law (a very talented Physician and jazz pianist) and my brother to Glioblastoma. My daughter’s close friend (22 years old) has it as well. Prayer and CBD oil has shrunk her tumor to a very tiny spot! Good luck to your father!

71 2018-07-02 23:51:57 Impossible under anything approaching normal conditions. Oil survived in the subsurface for millions of years w/o change except cracking at extreme depth/pressure. Mismanagement might lead to biodegradation from microbes but unlikely.

75 2018-07-02 23:51:18 can be a great natural lubricant! But, as with all things, you should be careful and do your research prior to using as it may disrupt your ph, know what works for you! Coconut oil can be a great natural option!

86 2018-07-02 23:49:40 Most of the economic upturn is a result of all the work Obama did. Meanwhile Trump is crippling sustainable programs like solar power to support oil and coal just to line his own pockets. Every single thing he's done has been to enrich himself. He doesn't care about America.
87 2018-07-02 23:49:27 So my neighbours, that back onto my garden, have built a huge fire. Quite near my brittle garden shed.   oh..... and oil tank.
88 2018-07-02 23:49:26 If it was water in the oil the engine would look fkn terrible. Nasty condensation though.  I've started taking two keys and leaving my old V8 locked and running for short local trips.

96 2018-07-02 23:48:54 Just thinking, maybe we should sell our oil to China. Stop sending electricity from Churchill Falls to New York and the other Eastern states. Well at least stick a 25% tariff on it. Use the funds to help our steel plants. Do I hear darkNewYork

108 2018-07-02 23:46:22 Oil prices are not that high historically in real terms. Gasoline prices are also not that high in historical and real terms. US gasoline prices are much cheaper that in the EU and most industrialized countries. Try Iceland’s prices for a while.

112 2018-07-02 23:45:54 Do you have enough workers there to take all the jobs? I don't think so. When I moved to Alberta I was hired on the phone sight unseen because of a labour shortage. Not everyone in Alberta is willing to work in the oil patch and give up their families for a while

126 2018-07-02 23:44:12 ITS REAL GOOD my method is heating some olive oil in a skillet w/ the spices, then adding the tilapia and cooking it (medium heat ish) on each side for 2-3 minutes. w/ a lid on bc oil spatters. extra good w/ a splash of lemon juice in the pan! i also break up the fillet halfway

The clay is *quite* drying, if you wipe it on the back of your hand and let it sit a little while, when you wipe it off the skin is noticeably dried out and looks like it needs lotion.
150 2018-07-02 23:42:19 That is absolutely Rich: New England refuses to allow Pipe Line Building Permits Therefore Texas Oil & Gas stop at NY - So Where does New England Get Petroleum? They Buy it From Russia whose Tankers drop anchor in their waters

159 2018-07-02 23:41:44 Kurt Vonnegut foresaw China's nefarious plan in "Slapstick". Western civilization is nearing collapse as oil runs out, and the Chinese are making vast leaps forward by miniaturizing themselves and training groups of hundreds to think as one.

210 2018-07-02 23:36:29 Agree. It’s tragic really. The fact that I would even have to debate this is horrifying. This man is suppose to protect our environment. Instead he strips it in order to secure deals for oil/coal execs, tries to hide polluted water by military bases, stops climate research,
211 2018-07-02 23:36:29 OMG #Trump seems to think he controls EVERYTHING... and is willing to sacrificed the indebted #US #oil producers, and that part of the #economy, whilst playing world chess. #USA oil producers are JUST starting to make money... then this!?

224 2018-07-02 23:35:14 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

229 2018-07-02 23:34:14 Preparation for #indyref2? Wanting to make oil and gas look like a major volatile part of Scotland's economy...
230 2018-07-02 23:34:12 The Diesel engine was designed to run on vegetable oil so that farmers can grow their fuel. The US oil industry stuffed all that and made us eat big macs so there is no land left to grow fuel without further deforestation.
231 2018-07-02 23:33:55 There isn’t a deficit once we control the oil revenues which just last week the U.K. govt admitted were fudged during the last referendum.
232 2018-07-02 23:33:37 An oil change will have you feeling like you just bought a $100,000 car.
233 2018-07-02 23:33:30 It's a crude biological weapon.  I wonder when it is he will grasp that the US no longer needs to by his oil.
234 2018-07-02 23:33:25 I got gifted a beard kit. and it came with oil and balm. I gotta snag the name when I get home. It has a nice citrus smell to it tho. not too strong.

240 2018-07-02 23:32:59 So you're ok with going for oil instead renewables? Letting poor and sick peope go without help? You're ok w people attacking others with specifically designed exhaust systems?
You're ok w hunting? Allowing suffering?
241 2018-07-02 23:32:58 Happy not to use the pound. That means we can ignore the debt and keep all the oil. Oh and we can just use the pound anyway. Permission isn’t actually needed.
242 2018-07-02 23:32:33 Cars and planes are fed to us like food to foie gras geese. CO2 emissions will continue to increase exponentially until we stop allowing big oil to do business. Then the sustainable “alternatives” will be life savers.
243 2018-07-02 23:32:25 I’m so happy I did the oil change and changed all 8 spark plugs on my truck alone almost died but It’s coool
244 2018-07-02 23:32:20 The idea that the US government will pressure nations not to buy oil from Iran, but do nothing when it comes to gold held by its own citizens overseas is absurd.

252 2018-07-02 23:31:38 No I’m saying we kept peace,  I’m also saying we used it to our benefit to make money and get oil and not every CIC was a good one.  I thought you were red?

276 2018-07-02 23:27:24 @mcannonbrookes Hi Mike , when Rudolf Diesel invented the Diesel Engine he had Farmers in mind as the diesel engine is designed to run on vegetable oil , which every farmer or perhaps a co op could produce. If we go vegetarian we could grow the fuel without further deforestation.
277 2018-07-02 23:27:21 Why? Do you clean your car before going to the car-wash? Change the oil before taking your car for a service?

299 2018-07-02 23:24:11 Montana, North Dakota, Alabama, Louisiana.... Hmmmm. Oil maybe? These people walk around with a big middle finger to our country, and their constituents most likely have NO CLUE what they’re up to.
300 2018-07-02 23:24:09 Really, THAT crazy woman is their advisor on the oil sands? She has been a radical Eco terrorist for years, and should play no part in oil sands development, when clearly, her stated goal is to destroy it.
301 2018-07-02 23:24:00 Kill the planet for oil. *sigh*
302 2018-07-02 23:23:58 Such a great game, until you get to oil. Oil can die in a fire.
303 2018-07-02 23:23:53 bernie fails to mention - the reason those countries, he wants to models his plans after, can do them - colonizing countries filled with brown people, raping the lands for resources, leaving the ppl in poverty.  and now, nordic countries heavily rely on oil.
304 2018-07-02 23:23:27 Tell me @kia. If the next step after determining my OIL IS LOW after 500mi of driving is to check spark plugs...how can now my oil now NOT BE LOW?!
305 2018-07-02 23:23:21 Tax breaks didn’t allow them to slash the workforce. Are you saying without the tax breaks the oil companies would have maintained the same levels of staff? Really?
306 2018-07-02 23:22:59 Olive oil is life!!!
307 2018-07-02 23:22:44 I can’t even make this shit up. @kia tells me to do a 500mi oil consumption test. Drove 500mi. Go back. I’m told oil is low, next step is to check spark plugs, will take 1.5hr. I can wait or make appointment. I make appointment. Told spark plugs look fine and oil isn’t low.
308 2018-07-02 23:22:43 Hi Edward. Is it only Scotland that is badly affected by the oil prices or is the UK also?
309 2018-07-02 23:22:37 “Oh I used vegetable oil instead the butter the recipe recommends” “oh, why isn’t this very good?”

313 2018-07-02 23:22:11 Meh. We won’t have to deal with it. I’d be shocked if Voynov ended up on the Oil.
314 2018-07-02 23:22:00 u_u im sorry to hear that!!! i've heard that hemp oil is a cheaper alternative?
315 2018-07-02 23:21:57 Pretty sure u and #AMLO won’t be friends. He is for increased student, elderly & welfare spending, universal access to colleges, ending big oil monopoly, cutting politicians salaries. Oh and u lock up Mexican children! #KeepFamilesTogether

322 2018-07-02 23:20:19 well, according to the hair person I have dry patches in my scalp and those are the ones that hurt.  Because they get irritated by the chemical used.  They may hurt again so he advised that I used a hair mask made of Jojoba oil and Macadamia oil to raise the moisture
323 2018-07-02 23:20:13 Bio oil
324 2018-07-02 23:20:11 Tax breaks. After years of squandering oil revenues they gave massive oil companies tax breaks to allow them to slash the workforce  so they will again make massive profit on oil price hikes. No oil fund considered.

339 2018-07-02 23:18:25 Ash says to use some of those hot oil treatments. (Like damaged by lush) to get the moisture back in your hair.
340 2018-07-02 23:18:25 I understand that people who come to an actual real port of entry (I think there is something like 130 of them along the border) can request asylum and not be separated from their children. That seems reasonable to me.
341 2018-07-02 23:18:22 That oil will take TWO HUNDRED YEARS to burn. Meanwhile, you want Canada to reduce emissions while you have no problem with China DOUBLING theirs, yes?

365 2018-07-02 23:15:19 if olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from? 
366 2018-07-02 23:15:16 Did he bring any coal jobs with him or just more snake oil for you and the rest of the rubes?
367 2018-07-02 23:15:12 Key question: for how long does US expect SA to pump to capacity (or: for how long can SA sustain that rate)??
If Iran can outwait them.. bad news for SA and US. No nuke deal and Iran will go ahead with it.. and with taking oil to market (already doing it I'd assume).

371 2018-07-02 23:14:25 Nope..I've even tried a chemical barrier cream that oil rig workers use (recommended by The Husband)...plant contact from gardening is a constant problem for me. Even when the garden is just mostly Tulips early in the yr...my arms are a mess.

1. When Balq, the oil exec, comes into the diner, he literally pushes Toller out of frame. There's a "let the big boys talk" feel to it.

2. Balq looks uncannily like our MT Representative.

You know, the bodyslam guy.

390 2018-07-02 23:11:50 So, it's called "Iridescent Fried Tofu" from The Taco Cleanse cook book. A normal 3 step flour, dredge, (panko) bread deep fry set up with some paprika, garlic powder, and kelp powder in the flour. Heat oil to 350 F. (I use a heavy cast iron for temperature stability)
391 2018-07-02 23:11:46 The oil was the giveaway. 
392 2018-07-02 23:11:24 1/ One of the great underreported investment stories is BTC's nascent replacement of gold as a safety hedge. At this point in the economic and Fed cycles, precious metals should be doing far better (even considering recent dollar strength). Seen oil recently? It's clear that....
393 2018-07-02 23:11:18 I’ve been putting castor oil in my hair and she’s flourishing 
394 2018-07-02 23:11:04 Pretty simple actually. Spending per capita is out of control.  Spend the same per capita asBC and save $9B annually. And BC gets generally better outcomes.   A responsible government would act on this in the face of declining oil revenues. Against NDP ideology.
395 2018-07-02 23:11:02 IPMAN pledges support for war against oil theft
396 2018-07-02 23:11:01 The other day I intentionally ordered a “paleo” black coffee with butter and coconut oil, and honestly I’m still wondering if that was just a lapse in judgement or a cry for help
397 2018-07-02 23:11:00 Deep below the meniscus of my mind,
Where the oil of logic refuses to mix with the water of will,
There, belly-up, float my feelings for you.

434 2018-07-02 23:06:18 I’m an actual tit, Dad just had to rescue me, had NO oil in my car, like completely empty. I’m so stupid I swear
435 2018-07-02 23:06:18 Higher gas prices are a sign of a booming economy. More truck delivering goods, more salemen on the road, and more people taking vacations. Given that oil is shipped from other side of planet, refined and shipped across country via pipelines & trucks, pretty cheap compared 2 Milk
436 2018-07-02 23:06:17 I'm in $SLV too early, happened to me in oil earlier this year. I thought I'd learned from that trade lol guess not.
437 2018-07-02 23:06:12 Then,ofc,the Shah was overthrown for allowing his country to be plundered by foreign companies & letting the profits of their oil go to rich US/UK businessmen & none to the Iranian people; & now we have the Islamic Republic of Iran. You can thank US for that ;^) @tresmonsieur201

445 2018-07-02 23:05:20 Olive Oil on everything! Avoid going hard on red meats and cheese, if you can, even though they're high in fat. Avocados are also clutch and unsalted peanuts in small doses.

451 2018-07-02 23:04:44 ... and as @Big_Orrin illustrated earlier today, oil in SPR is not what we need.  Lots of 32-26 API in storage and we need the 20-25 — which is not there in large quants.

456 2018-07-02 23:04:27 I used to get extensions but ever since I started using castor oil and cocoa butter Vaseline on them, they’ve gotten fuller and thicker and I only used it for 5 weeks.
457 2018-07-02 23:04:17 That game was worth it one year after release. Now that shit id a fucking platinum level find at $60.

459 2018-07-02 23:04:04 Not much fat so I added butter and extra olive oil
460 2018-07-02 23:04:00 " . . . murdering and kidnapping to try and keep the peace" is the inevitable devolution of all democratic socialist (communists) govs.  Regarding the oil, as Warren Buffett says, when the tide goes out you see who is swimming naked.  In this case, it is ideological nakedness.
461 2018-07-02 23:03:57 Have sprayed the entire bed with every oil spiders hate, so now the bed feels greasy as hell
462 2018-07-02 23:03:49 Gotta do oil change and car wash this weekend

471 2018-07-02 23:02:50 but we import all our domestic fuel now. the oil we produce in NZ is exported.
472 2018-07-02 23:02:37 I’m the worst black girl ever. I can’t fry anything. It’s either I soak my food in grease or oil is poppin all over the kitchen and my food is burning  #sendhelp

478 2018-07-02 23:01:27 I don't want my taxes going to fight oil wars, but I don't get to decide that they don't. So you might just have to suck it up and accept that poor people deserve to recover from illness too.

480 2018-07-02 23:01:17 Snap - the power generation answer has to come from renewables  Oil and gas are too precious a resource to merely burn to release energy. I hope we realise before it's too late.

482 2018-07-02 23:00:58 easiest way to pay for the wall is to put a surcharge on the money illegals send back home. that money is a big chunk of there revenue falling only behind oil  exports
483 2018-07-02 23:00:58 So, have you figured it out yet? Have you seen our gas prices lately? highest since 2014. Do you what happened in 2014? We signed a deal with Iran, they were allowed to sell oil once again and gas prices went down. Now 45 backs out of the deal and gas prices start to go up again.
484 2018-07-02 23:00:56 Sorry. Idc i can’t be out here ashy. What are people using to moisturize? OIL? That’s even worse

502 2018-07-02 22:58:49 Needed an oil change. Dad made me go to a dealer because its free. 4 Hours later, I've decided that even if it is free I am bringing it to the 10 Min oil change and paying for it. #wastedday

517 2018-07-02 22:56:22 What do you do the day after you walk 4+/- miles in flip flops and then have to sit all day at work?

You drink tons of water to rehydrate throughout the day, then soak in a magnesium salt, coconut oil, and essential oil bath to regenerate.

520 2018-07-02 22:56:11 Sadly, the world is run on oil & gas. And I don’t see that changing until it starts to run out. As an environmental science grad, I’m painfully aware of the cost. But as someone who lives in Europe’s Oil Capital, I’m also aware of the economic impact of losing the industry.
521 2018-07-02 22:56:10 Great now gas and heating oil will be going up in the ocean state. Who do you think will pay for the lawsuit?  Us we will have pay both sides of lawyers.

It was £1.18 billion in 2018, according to HMRC.

539 2018-07-02 22:53:44 Over the weekend, Trump claimed he got the Saudis to agree to increase oil production by 2 million barrels per day.

HE WAS LYING, AS USUAL.

Both the White House and the Saudis have already contradicted Trump's statement.

552 2018-07-02 22:51:42 I think that you might be overlooking the fact that even the single market Norway type solution would not work for the UK. We need to be part of the Customs Union as well. Norway exports fish and oil. Our industry is enmeshed in European supply chains
553 2018-07-02 22:51:33 I wager that that compliment was made partly out of frustration and partly out of admiration. Unfortunately it is likely a reference to his experience and a need to see someone different from what appears to be a norm at those conferences. By the way, Oil and Healthcare?

Far too soft to make a difference. So desperate they actually contemplate a jv with the Marxists under no industry/development/oil J Shaw
556 2018-07-02 22:51:12 Indeed - especially when you add on the environmental and social impact across the world you have to wonder whether we pay for oil and gas with blood of lives lost and lives that will never be born die to climate change

- know your worth and don’t lower yourself for a nigga

562 2018-07-02 22:50:19 What is happening in Venezuela has many causes, bad leadership being a major factor. You can have bad leaders on any side of the spectrum. Also, the country has had a very volatile history & its economy's dependence on the price of oil has not helped...

565 2018-07-02 22:50:07 Grape Seed Oil
Grape seed oil contains fatty acids and vitamin E which give a calming effect to the skin and prevent skin redness. It gets absorbed fast so you won´t feel your skin oily after application.

576 2018-07-02 22:47:51 Everything is working?  Kim played him, tariffs are crippling American Farming and Steel users. China is positioned to replace us as the world leader, the Debt and the Deficit are rising and oil prices are eating at the Middle Class.  Who’s paying for that wall?
577 2018-07-02 22:47:49 Need to get those tortillas heated and softened up in a pan with a little oil. Chop up the bacon.  Mix it in w/ tomato and onion into the eggs.   Pour a little salsa verde (green sauce) over the eggs.   Spuds look good.   I am Irish living in Mexico BTW.  Know my Mexican chow.
578 2018-07-02 22:47:31 Why we need free college..because these oil based economies are slowly dying. Venezuela Libya. Syria next is Iran.. the migrant crisis is picking up steam in these countries..going to have to re educate.the system. Just tell them truth bernie.
579 2018-07-02 22:47:15 Its right he had quite aggressive politcs, but it is still the US who accused them of having chem. Weapons. Eventhough they knew, that they didnt. The only thing the us wanted was oil, and now they have it.
580 2018-07-02 22:47:10 I disagree. I think Peterson is milking the e-fame thing and is selling some snake-oil-lite of his own, but he has intellectual integrity, whereas PJW is the opposite of such. He's a dishonest hackjob that people celebrate because he validates their political enthusiasm.
581 2018-07-02 22:47:04 organic beard oil - $65
582 2018-07-02 22:47:04 terus 2mingguan ini alhamdulillah jerawatku udah cukup membaik, cobain pake toner acv + rose water + grapeseed oil dari kylie secret di shopeenya healtynoona. udah itu aja. yg penting sih jaga konsumsi sama less skincare aja
583 2018-07-02 22:46:50 karma is a bitch isn’t it for not using sunscreen and using tan oil instead...
584 2018-07-02 22:46:48 Make it all and store the leftovers in a container. You can add a little butter or olive oil when reheating in a pan
585 2018-07-02 22:46:35 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
586 2018-07-02 22:46:32 One of the reasons Canada got to keep its supply management was because we agreed to give the US special access to our oil and gas. Kill NAFTA and you lose that.
587 2018-07-02 22:46:25 I meant 3 in one oil u fuck stick
588 2018-07-02 22:46:21 I got a call from a local pawn shop today and this is what I left with......Gas...oil....advertising is becoming more and more popular to collect this stuff will be sold to my collectors.....
589 2018-07-02 22:46:20 Lovely can I rub you down in baby oil
590 2018-07-02 22:46:10 And that’s just one of many ways I use to make my masks ... turmeric, aloe Vera gel , with coconut oil SIS 
591 2018-07-02 22:46:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however however many there may be.
592 2018-07-02 22:46:03 Hirap talaga magprito pag marinated putakte pumuputok yung kawali sa talsik ng oil e
593 2018-07-02 22:45:44 When I'm broke, nah to take garri palm oil and salt
594 2018-07-02 22:45:43 Arugula dressed with lemon and olive oil topped with smoked salmon. I’m out of salmon now and might try anchovies next tho I’m a little scared.
595 2018-07-02 22:45:30 Under Chavez, the lower socioeconomic classes thrived. That’s why his ppl loved him. Unfortunately, he put all of Venezuela’s eggs into the oil basket. When oil tanked, so did the economy and society. Now Maduro is murdering and kidnapping to try and keep the peace. 1/2
596 2018-07-02 22:45:03 I’d say Kislyak to Sessions & not significant backchannel. The deal got started when oil was real high (80+ barrel). Russia uses 1950s drill tech, so high costs. Part of the reason the Obama admin was quietly pro fracking & got KoSA to up production was to hamstring Russia.
597 2018-07-02 22:44:48 washed my hair  now i just need to oil it and put this weave in 
598 2018-07-02 22:44:45 Cbd oil chocolate milk shakes. Vegan, raw, and served with a big hug. I love festivals 
599 2018-07-02 22:44:42 In the last 12 mnths due to weak £ & rising oil price: Diesel has increased 15p, Petrol 13p - As a result, an extra £1.1bn in VAT has been generated. What has the Govt done with that windfall? @steve_hawkes @halfon4harlowMP @HowardCCox @MrHarryCole @QuentinWillson @Kirstene4Angus
600 2018-07-02 22:44:37 balance has been restored to the universe because I just did a hot oil treatment
601 2018-07-02 22:44:23 Some author in California is claiming Jesus healed with cannabis oil. Clearly he is a certifiable crackpot. But just to be safe, let's double-lock the ambry. @NDBasilica
602 2018-07-02 22:44:18 Isn’t the point of me having an appointment so I don’t wait 2 hours for just an oil change? @DavidMaus_Chevy @TeamChevy Clearly you guys overbooked...
603 2018-07-02 22:44:14 Please take look you oil needs changing because you are a pint low.
604 2018-07-02 22:44:13 Tea Tree Oil is recommended for dandruff too. #FunFact @TheBonfireSXM @bigjayoakerson @DanSoder
605 2018-07-02 22:44:03 Do y’all tip your oil change guys?
606 2018-07-02 22:43:52 I live a couple hundred miles from the coast. Never seen a gold toilet except in pictures from Trump tower, which looks like the oil sheiks had a yard sale. I guess I have to live on the water to be "elite?"
607 2018-07-02 22:43:41 I rolled my eyes sooo hard today at Voldemort’s claim that Nelson *once* was open to oil drilling in the Everglades! @FLGovScott environmental policy is Slash & Burn!

608 2018-07-02 22:43:39 A young lady was rushed into the emergency room this evening with severe abdominal pain.History revealed she took about 15 tablets of Paracetamol,drank enough condemned engine oil and tried to kill herself.Just bcos she was jilted by her boyfriend/lover.
609 2018-07-02 22:43:34 Flexirods and hair oil.
610 2018-07-02 22:43:30 There's no life form on earth sacred to this British  Oil Company then!!!
So it seems that British or Foreign Oil or Gas Companies throughout the planet, it's only money that matters.
611 2018-07-02 22:43:28 Having a bit of an anxiety episode now and smelling strong medicated oil to calm myself down. The past few days & strange weather have been taking a toil on me. Didn't shower for 2 days straight & after that I showered only to skip it again yesterday. I know I'm in this freeze
612 2018-07-02 22:43:02 “For fiscal year 2019, the Board certified a general fund of $8.76B. The sources of funds are: general fund revenues totaling, $8.46B and funds collected from the excise tax on crude oil, which add another $299 million.” @njaresko
613 2018-07-02 22:43:00 Oil companies sitting back enjoying gas prices heading back to pre Obama era prices with the government asleep at the wheel. With huge corporate tax cuts and gas heading back to $4.00 a gallon. Thank you Donald.
614 2018-07-02 22:42:46 I’m sure your not the only one hun, just they are covered by photoshop etc, it’s perfectly normal, but I’ve heard bio oil works well for it:)
615 2018-07-02 22:42:45 I do believe they just got a step closer to winning. Not sure if it's enough though. But like we say in Oil Country:  there's always next year" 
616 2018-07-02 22:42:43 Until the next war or oil rig comes around again. Life rages back if given the slightest opportunity.
617 2018-07-02 22:42:40 Wait till the oil and gas run out, more tax to import it, whole country will be in poverty then
618 2018-07-02 22:42:33 Blows my mind they test for this.

619 2018-07-02 22:42:13 What you call "allies" have been sheep in wolf's clothing.  Pretending to be our friends and spitting on us every time.  We have NEW allies now.  One's that are working WITH us.  Saudi Arabia has increased oil output to LOWER prices.  That's a first and just one example.
620 2018-07-02 22:42:00 Motor oil please
621 2018-07-02 22:42:00 I'm sure you get nausea as well. CBD oil is legal in all states,as long as it has less than 1 per thc. I looked into it.
622 2018-07-02 22:41:57 Hmm I’m not typically a post shower oil person but, I do like the Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Anti-Frizz Serum!
623 2018-07-02 22:41:25 Yep guess so oil companies that are subsidized
624 2018-07-02 22:41:20 ...hot weather.  If you put some on your hair, it will even destroy the bad oil your hair produces when you don't shower as much.  Since the extra virgin olive oil is an anti-aging product and also has SPF for sunblock, it's perfect for the residents of Redding.  You can also...
625 2018-07-02 22:41:14 which one do you use? I use banana boat dark tanning oil
626 2018-07-02 22:41:01 Let’s give a shout out to Trump for ripping up the Iran Deal that helped keep oil prices low while maintaining a verifiable check on their inactive nuclear program.Thanks to @realDonaldTrump oil is at its highest in years & Iran wants to start up its nuclear program
627 2018-07-02 22:41:01 Not. 
628 2018-07-02 22:40:52 In all honesty I used to on a rare occasion smoke a joint when I would be unable to ease my mind it would be like hitting a reset button. But then I switched to a CBD oil which helped a lot.
629 2018-07-02 22:40:37 One of my work WhatsApp groups has been taken over by it! No more discussions about the fluctuations in the price of a barrel of oil, Keynesian economics & the Customs Union, no conversations have turned to the lives & loves of some pretty people on a Big Brother-esque programme
630 2018-07-02 22:40:31 Oil the wheels before you hop on the wagon
631 2018-07-02 22:40:25 …むにゃ…ぐぅ(エルザちゃんに寄りかかる
632 2018-07-02 22:40:20 I've considered it! I think if I add that it contains essence of cedar oil I could charge even more.
633 2018-07-02 22:40:14 Because we have no oil.
634 2018-07-02 22:40:10 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。

637 2018-07-02 22:39:53 willingly jumps into the pyramid of oil cans
638 2018-07-02 22:39:19 Remember Norway has a zillion in oil and oil money - its can pay for otherwise stupid policies.
Norway wants to protect its very inefficient farm production (small farms  many at semi-arctic latitude) and their large exclusive fishing zone

The UK needs the CU for auto+airbus+...
639 2018-07-02 22:39:11 Question-what kind of services do these oil companies provide???  Services that we shouldn’t have bc of “climate change”?
640 2018-07-02 22:38:56 Our "sea dogs" (pirates) hunted whales to near extinction & then refined kerosene to replace whale oil in street lamps. Cruised the world looking for minerals to extract & to grift property from people sitting on them.
641 2018-07-02 22:38:49 With all due respect to a great scholar whom I read regularly, this is surprisingly a rather negative approach, comparable to the proposal to price oil and other commodities in various currencies other than the US dollar.  We must build not dismantle.
642 2018-07-02 22:38:37 So far the best part of having a job again is Scott not caring anymore if I spend $65 on gourmet vinegar and olive oil.
643 2018-07-02 22:38:30 $70 for an oil change SURE BITCH
644 2018-07-02 22:38:27 Coconut oil
645 2018-07-02 22:38:24 Love the canned one in oil!! Do you eat Wild Planet brand?

647 2018-07-02 22:37:43 There's an Asusu sold by @SterlingBankIR @Sterlingbank_IR @sterlingbankng for 6000#,its automated,one of a kind technology, you save your money in it,it has a lot of features ,your bank acct credits when u take it to d bank,withdrawal also is automated.
648 2018-07-02 22:37:30 ...If you go to Walmart, you can buy an African product made of extra virgin olive oil (12 oz. for less than $3).  Extra virgin olive oil removes and/or destroys all bad oils that your body produces when you don't clean as much as possible or when you sweat like a pig in this...
649 2018-07-02 22:37:14 finally got my oil changed & my brakes done. 
650 2018-07-02 22:36:12 And he got the Arab world to work with ISRAEL in stomping out radical islam.  AND he got SA to release oil to lower prices!!  (who even thought that was possible!)
651 2018-07-02 22:36:02 jan when you use your oil of olay in morning rub from throat up to chin and do that daily also a high tight pony tail works to train muscles . always massage up and around ears . my old great great granny passed down and works !1

654 2018-07-02 22:35:43 The number of oil fans that couldn’t stand Horcoff after he got his huge raise after the 06 season baffles me. No way would I have turned that ridiculous offer down either!
655 2018-07-02 22:35:34 Retweeted Animal Watch (@Animal_Watch):

BBC correction:
Correction 2 July 2018: This story has been changed to make it clear that the commission will decide whether oil drilling should be allowed. We initially reported that oil drilling had already been allowed.
656 2018-07-02 22:35:19 What? Spend more oil money and buy more foreign players? Cool
657 2018-07-02 22:35:19 Liar!  You had absolutely nothing to do with the Saudi's decision to increase oil production.  Believe it or not Trump, the world doesn't revolve around you....
658 2018-07-02 22:34:56 You'd be surprised. I'm an esthetician. When your skin is dehydrated it is different than being dry. When there is dehydration  it sends signals to oil-producing glands to produce more oil to moisturize itself. You might be producing more oil because of dehydrated skin.
659 2018-07-02 22:34:54 Given that the government is putting ethnic minorities in camps and encouraging attacks on the press, how long until the US invades the US for oil?

665 2018-07-02 22:34:22 Surely Texas have had enough snake oil to last them a lifetime.
666 2018-07-02 22:34:20 Saw some wind row oil seed rape today in Warwickshire
667 2018-07-02 22:34:18 A good thing to remember is dark hair reflects light and light hair absorbs it so dark hair will always look healthier and shinier use a dry oil spray on blonde hair to make it look shinier
668 2018-07-02 22:34:16 これマジなの？っておもってリプ欄みてたけどマジなのか……

670 2018-07-02 22:34:00 Yeah, black oil + CGR/rubbing = hybrid.
671 2018-07-02 22:33:40 When Rihanna said she used to crush glitter eyeshadow and rub it on her body with baby oil.... She knew what was up...
672 2018-07-02 22:33:39 I’m pretty sure we’ve played ALL the oil out of the 6-5-4 chord progression.
673 2018-07-02 22:33:35 It's time for another #MeditationMonday 

Frankincense essential oil has the ability to slow down heartbeat & deepen the breath. This makes it perfect for tuning out distractions & tapping into your highest self. 

Set your intention, apply a few drops to a tissue, & breathe.

677 2018-07-02 22:32:41 Good for her! Who's the guy he's lunching with? Some one in the oil and gas biz? I'm sure he'll try and use this for justification of more security
678 2018-07-02 22:32:09 Walk. Castor oil . Sex. Spicy food. Allat. When is your next dr. Appointment?
679 2018-07-02 22:32:03 It would be good if the govt honestly said that we can afford the nhs, but if we want brexit too we are going to have to increase taxes starting with fuel, then freeze personal allowances then raise income tax. When oil rises we’ll replace duty with more direct tax and VATat 25%

695 2018-07-02 22:29:20 And there is CBD oil with THC by the way. There’s also a lot of fake CBD oil out here so be cautious
696 2018-07-02 22:28:59 Is that the only one you have? That’s what happens when you build your countries economics around the unpredictable market that is the oil industry.  Democratic socialism would mean that no one should be too poor to not afford healthcare and higher education. Like Denmark.

702 2018-07-02 22:28:30 Why is pasta with garlic + olive oil so good when I order it at restaurants but so bland when I make it at home???
703 2018-07-02 22:28:02 @Mad_Morris Gender stuff is a constant theme on ABC news...why does everything have to be heavily gendered? Also looking forward to discussion of gender gap in professions like garbage collection and oil rig workers (dirtiest, most dangerous, toughest jobs basically).
704 2018-07-02 22:27:53 Recent events have demonstrated that the #oil crescent is the highest peak in the #Libyan scene, you can see the #interests of different #states from the highest peak. #Democracy, #reconciliation, #HumanRights , #stability, #freedom are values, and values do not generate #energy.

710 2018-07-02 22:27:11 Sanctions damage European companies. Europe is dependent on Russian gas, but America hopes that we isolate Russia and then buy American oil and gas. A closer relationship between Russia and Europe will damage America's economic position.
711 2018-07-02 22:27:04 I love this theory that she wasn't ACTUALLY infertile. But yeah, I always thought that the black oil could have somehow made Scully fertile when Mulder gave it to her. But again, they never went back to Mulder's alienism, whereas they visited it CONSTANTLY with Scully
712 2018-07-02 22:27:04 I had to give up butter (amongst other things) after my Stroke but said no to margarineFor cooking I use olive oil and I take my toast dry now...that's better than margarine, which to me is an imitation food like substance...and gross
713 2018-07-02 22:26:57 It's not just the #oil . The world turns around the stories we tell and not the reality of things.
714 2018-07-02 22:26:52 Plus the tunnel that houses the oil, water, and whisky pipes also allows us MI5 agents to get into Scotland unseen.

716 2018-07-02 22:26:32 if you can you should get a towel and pour milk on it and lay it on your burn. it takes away most of the sting before you add aloe or coconut oil to moisturize it! (i am pale and know how bad this hurts good luck bb)
717 2018-07-02 22:26:23 Oven and oil need to be preheated mate, it's the most important step! And you call yourself a chef 
718 2018-07-02 22:26:14 this my 3rd oil change in a month 
719 2018-07-02 22:26:03 Do you know what you are talking about? All European countries are social democracies. Most of them don't have own oil sources. Yet just about every European country passes the US on the happiness index, have a higher life expectancy and don't go broke bc of hospital bills.
720 2018-07-02 22:25:47 I like Miracle Whip. I like to see an Olive oil version.
721 2018-07-02 22:24:36 Any war with Iran will stir trouble that will escalate and break KSA. The US will be left on the ropes, on the end of a very high oil price, holding out but unable to win. The fire will spread and Russians will see opportunity.
722 2018-07-02 22:24:32 My right ankle is badly swollen that it’s all pressing on a nerve. I can’t control my leg as getting spasms. Feels like I have excessive energy. Take CBD oil, pain still there but I am relaxed so don’t care. Hopefully it’ll be a good night xx

724 2018-07-02 22:23:57 I thought it was a thing . However when removing it PLEASE USE SOME FORM OF OIL TO LOOSEN THE GLUE.
725 2018-07-02 22:23:54 I hate getting my oil changed, they always tell you a bunch of stuff is wrong with your car when they hand you the bill afterwards and I'm just like cool idc hand me my keys so I can leave

727 2018-07-02 22:23:46 Chemical and biological degradation of crude oil under atmospheric pressure is a thing.
728 2018-07-02 22:23:33 And they still charge more for gas in America than in the middle eastern oil rich nations. Oil companies are ripping us off. They never show a loss in making money. But what can we do!
729 2018-07-02 22:23:19 So that means you will stop doing business with them as well??? Buying oil from the Saudis at some $30 dollars and selling back to your fellow Americans for $300 whilst you keep yours in reserve until one day they see you later when they wake up - bunch of hypocrites!!!

741 2018-07-02 22:21:45 That Kurdish Leadership didn't provide for anyone while enjoying the wealth of rich oil Kirkuk one of the most productive oil field in the Middle east region. It sounds like certain Kurds are addicted to a mediocre leadership.

746 2018-07-02 22:21:29 Agreed. And no guarantee they will succeed at all. What will be the non oil economy’s competitive advantage vs the world? Can’t really think of one as yet.
747 2018-07-02 22:21:26 And look at DRC now. Neglected, corrupt, killing their own indigenous gorillas in a bid to get wealth from oil.

754 2018-07-02 22:21:02 So just recently got my oil changed and got brand new tires on, my cars driving like when I first got it. I’m ready to race someone now
755 2018-07-02 22:20:58 Truffle oil is abhorrent. Once in your mouth it takes over and invades all subsequent bites of food. #flightdelayedthought2
756 2018-07-02 22:20:53 Per a family member who is a cop, CBD oil shows up as marijuana on drug tests...if taking drug tests doesn’t apply to you than keep scrolling but y’all have to stop following trends without proper research
757 2018-07-02 22:20:36 Isn’t it a fancy vinegar? Goes well with olive oil and focaccia bread?
758 2018-07-02 22:20:36 @SalSports ketchup isn’t even close to being a tomato! It’s watery tomato paste, soybean oil, white vinegar and tons of concentrated sugar (fructose) . Go for the fresh tomato filled with vitamins and great taste every time! No tomato? No ketchup! Burger is better without it.

773 2018-07-02 22:18:17 Never forget what you're fighting for!

It's probably oil. It's usually oil
774 2018-07-02 22:18:09 Went to get my oil changed and they WASHED MY CAR TOOOOOOOO :)))))
775 2018-07-02 22:18:09 No - I don't claim to be unlike you - however I've research alot into Venezuela. 
If you didn't know what went wrong, no-one can help you. 

Okay fine. I'll help. Oil. They shouldn't relied on solely oil as income. 

Also you can be in a dictatorship, if you're allowed elections
776 2018-07-02 22:18:09 Making dinner tonight I:
- grated my knuckle
- got lemon juice DIRECTLY in my eyeball
- acquired several tiny speckle burns from hot oil
- dropped everything I touched
But in the end I (and @Doc_Wolverine) still ATE THE FUCKER, SO THERE, I WIN.

787 2018-07-02 22:16:46 @PressSec Isn't it sad that Canada has taken advantage of the big Goliath over the years, after we have been raped of our natural resources, oil, gas, lumber, water, gold by the greedy American capitalist elites, while your middle class go broke with no health care.  Sad
788 2018-07-02 22:16:44 We bomb people of color for oil and #Israel.

790 2018-07-02 22:16:37 @JimBakkerShow During PTL he and Tammy peddled snake oil and they are still doing the same. It's obvious what he loves move because that is where he spends his energy.
791 2018-07-02 22:16:25 Crude is like ore. Mined copper left on the surface decomposes at 12% a year. Ore must go to a refinery as rapidly as possible. I always thought the same for oil. Oxidation. Yes, even in the salt caverns that oil is stored in.
792 2018-07-02 22:16:21 Tell me I’m not the only one today who forgot coconut oil isn’t solid when it’s this hot and accidentally covered themselves in it?
793 2018-07-02 22:16:17 Piper Alpha happened a week after I was born. Ridiculous and insulting to their memory that oil rigs still aren’t safe.

795 2018-07-02 22:15:53 I'm simple leave in conditioner and oil.
796 2018-07-02 22:15:51 Hey when you talk with Donnie tonight ask him if the Saudis really promised to increase oil production or if it was another lie?
797 2018-07-02 22:15:39 Been a patient investor since 2015 but I don't understand why there was a second placing if it is going to flow 1600bopd. Are we not going to sell what we produce? Looking at volumes mentioned we could make millions by selling oil rougher than placing. Shows lack of confidence.
798 2018-07-02 22:15:19 When you refuse to nationalize industry, you are a scumbag?   Damn!  This is getting out of hand over there folks.  Check your oil.  It’s about two pints low.

805 2018-07-02 22:14:37 The surge in oil prices over the past year is already starting to resemble an oil shock. worries over a trade war ahead of tariffs that will start being levied this week, the weakness in exports, and solution to the oil market’s woes looks  to come from demand not supply side.

809 2018-07-02 22:14:02 You didn’t mention that Venezuela also has the most oil reserves of any country on the planet.
810 2018-07-02 22:13:50 Too much oil!
811 2018-07-02 22:13:30 Exactly.
812 2018-07-02 22:13:30 Alexander Nix, director of SCL Group, was found to have had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant. Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders

818 2018-07-02 22:12:36 @GavinFree watching your chip pan fire video & wondered if you’d considered doing it with one of the glass pans? You’d see the water interact with the oil & the pan might even shatter.
819 2018-07-02 22:12:34 I also take iron/b12 tablets every other day which cost less then a steak for 30 pills, plus algae oil pills for the correct omega 3
820 2018-07-02 22:12:24 Not surprised. The truth always comes out ! Obama is king of the world in his mind. The sad part is the foolish leaders of nations who allow him to manipulate with his snake oil ! & he’s still at it you can be sure! & he’ll be first to back stab.
821 2018-07-02 22:12:21 While I’m waiting for my oil to get changed at wal mart, this random old man sits next to me and asks, “Do you come here often?” 

Yeah, I purposely fuck up my car and spend money I don’t have to meet greasy 50 year old men. Gtfo.
822 2018-07-02 22:12:11 I think you should reject it..better cars you can buy for the money...don’t mean to bother you, but do you have any opinions on shorting oil here? Remember your long term charts suggesting 15s or 200 and seems like we’re at a possible juncture for either hmm
823 2018-07-02 22:12:05 My point is that countries with high fuel duty are less sensitive to crude oil price fluctuations. Your point is true of any other tax: unfortunately if we want Brexit we have to pay for it: get used to less disposable income one way or another.

Then put an oil in it and sometimes a moisturizer. Most of the time I’ll just do conditioner and oil & wrap it in a bun . .
856 2018-07-02 22:08:16 If only the Democrats showed the same outrage at actions like this occurring in political strongholds they control, as they show towards Conservatives in general. 
Maybe then hope and change might be a reality and not just a slogan.
857 2018-07-02 22:08:11 Back away slowly and calmly. Walk like nothing is wrong toward the Exit. Then run like a MOFO before they get Amanda oil!!!!! 

By the way, where’s EMU?
858 2018-07-02 22:07:54 Well you said "Container" exports (by Ferry, presumably). There are  Bulk carrier ships for things like Wheat and Tankers for oil etc. Air freight is a growth area. The fact is, Eire CAN and WILL By-pass UK.

865 2018-07-02 22:06:59 I don’t know whether to consider a country rich in oil a curse or a blessing. They certainly do become a target.

867 2018-07-02 22:06:46 The fact that you think the democrats could launch anything is proof you’re a snake oil salesman.
868 2018-07-02 22:06:31 The government dropped the fuel duty to create some price stability. If they increase duty now, as oil prices are rising and the UK economy enters a negative part of the economic cycle (falls off a cliff),  how does that limit price volatility?
869 2018-07-02 22:06:27 I would rather skin my foot skin and stick it in peppermint oil than watch @amyschumer talk about her private parts and trump.
870 2018-07-02 22:06:26 It didn’t take long to get my oil change done and it was cheaper than I thought
871 2018-07-02 22:06:25 Tea Tree Oil is fantastic around the areas where the ants are. My daughter googled it a few years ago & worked a treat - house smelt nice too. Good luck 
872 2018-07-02 22:06:13 lol well, the desk is made up of pieces from Ikea and the desktop is specifically called a GERTON. It's solid wood but comes unfinished so I needed to sand it down and finish it with danish oil.

887 2018-07-02 22:05:03 Just as oil prices start to rise, we make energy even more expensive.

Can someone please form a conservative party, so these social democrat wets can rename their gaggle of arse-candles.

894 2018-07-02 22:04:06 They had to give term or else he would have signed elsewhere - lots of teams were reportedly interested.

897 2018-07-02 22:04:03 Cooking oil ? You mean to say those mujra commercials ?
898 2018-07-02 22:03:59 Have you ever heard of #threeleopardliniment? It’s a massage oil you rub into the affected area. It has arnica and turmeric to reduce inflammation and eucalyptus oil in as a pain reliever. It’s wonderful stuff! I use it to help after training...
899 2018-07-02 22:03:58 I used to put peppermint oil on my tummy
900 2018-07-02 22:03:39 Love or hate @Tesla  its every EV enthusiast duty todtand up and challenge every attack they see. We must stand together as the #EVrevolution grows and those in big oil go on the offensive

902 2018-07-02 22:03:20 If we benefit from “not breathing-in” exhaust from ICE vehicles it would be worth it.  The rest of the savings come from many other factors:  no oil changes, gas evaporation, gas transportation (labor + road damage), gas tanks in the ground (that used to be a big deal... leakage)

906 2018-07-02 22:03:01 Small wrinkle here is that the outright was almost half todays price in the early 90s. 200b on 40 oil is what to 74 and rising oil?

908 2018-07-02 22:02:55 Jar stuff is fine. Mum gets the treated beans. We soak them in boiling water. Then she fries them up with tons of garlic. Pots them up and the oil preserves it. Great for stir fries, topping fresh fish for steaming- so yum

918 2018-07-02 22:01:08 You mean groundnut oil 
919 2018-07-02 22:01:06 Both me and my mans are wearing @discheaux’s essential oil blends religiously. 
920 2018-07-02 22:01:00 We pay $25/hr as well now that the oil patch is dead. If it picks up crazy again our wages will have to go up some again. Good help doesn’t sit around here. Oil patch, mines or heavy construction jobs keeps able bodies working here. Hard to poach a good 1.
921 2018-07-02 22:00:42 In a move that won't lower oil prices, the US State Department said that America would apply sanctions, without exemption, on importers of Iranian oil from early November. Iran is OPEC's third-biggest oil producer- The Economist

940 2018-07-02 21:58:19 Hey #Trump ; you should have taken a lesson from #obama deal on Iran. What a great deal you crafted with #northkorea. No verification, no evidence of compliance.  Smoke and mirrors and lots of snake oil.
941 2018-07-02 21:58:08 I made tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, olive oil, salt, pepper, basil and balsamic. I thought it was dinner. We ate it like savages. But it was so good.  Does it need to be cooked? Start over. We don't cook in 900 degree weather.

944 2018-07-02 21:57:54 That's fundamentally what happened in Venezuela. The delta between their artificial market (costs & wages) was masked for years while the Government profitted from high oil revenue. When oil prices shifted, they could no longer subsidize the inefficiencies in their system.
945 2018-07-02 21:57:50 This Madrid statement interests me. They did the same with Verratti a few years ago. So Perez actually has a club he doesn't want to step on their toes? Feel Oil money playing?

952 2018-07-02 21:56:37 The White House finds itself in a quandary of its own making. Having effectively torn up the nuclear deal with Iran and apparently gunning to reduce that country’s oil exports to zero, Trump has teed up a jump in U.S. pump prices timed exquisitely for November’s midterms.

988 2018-07-02 21:52:15 Just get the cheapest oil/filter from walmart that actually fits your car (important part). They will only charge labor at that point.
989 2018-07-02 21:52:02 How does one order this magic oil?
990 2018-07-02 21:51:41 I think I’m allergic to the oil I’ve been using on my face. Every time I put it on I sneeze like 879 times.
991 2018-07-02 21:51:38 And the GOP is trying to give away our National Parks to big oil and gas.  Utah is beautiful .  All of our National Parks are worth saving.

993 2018-07-02 21:51:19 It would work for engagements too. Hide the ring at the bottom of the boiling oil.
994 2018-07-02 21:51:09 you need to kick those that don't follow you back, i kick them every 7 days, i'm here for the patriots not to make a name for my self. ill retire in the next couple of years myself. 41 years on the north slope and Alaska oil and gas

997 2018-07-02 21:50:22 “I know 5 guys has peanuts all over their location and use peanut oil to cook their burgers but can you make a special burger without that stuff”? 
Just don’t go to 5 guys
998 2018-07-02 21:50:19 I was told Charlotte web strain is being used on those suffering from seizures,check out Richard Simpson Oil or RSO he’s in the uk now, he literally cured him self & others in  but got raided, his website had some really good info, get medical marijuana grade if u can
999 2018-07-02 21:50:04 So you have an oil state ranked no1 ?!

1001 2018-07-02 21:49:49 Someone go to a rec shop for me? i need a g of oil.
1002 2018-07-02 21:49:49 Poorly written and researched article. US GDP is on track for 5%, best in a decade, and the world has proven oil reserves well into the next century.  Socialism has many innate flaws, so why did you feel the need to lie?
1003 2018-07-02 21:49:39 Thank you! :) I used mineral oil followed by a beeswax + mineral oil paste
1004 2018-07-02 21:49:38 Lol yes na ,what r u guys waiting for

1008 2018-07-02 21:49:26 Trump probably knew today's #EIA #data to show US avg #retail #gasoline price +1.1 cent vs prev week at $2.844/gallon, +58.4c vs yr ago (adding to yr-ago premium). Prices had eased in recent weeks. #Diesel also higher, +2c vs week ago at $3.236/gal, +76.4c vs yr ago. #OOTT #oil
1009 2018-07-02 21:49:15 Shouldn't the motor oil one be Eggman's?
1010 2018-07-02 21:49:11 Walker is quite the snake oil salesman. While he's flying around Wisconsin to use farmers for one photo op after another, Wisconsin is losing 500 farms per year and led the nation in farm bankruptcies in 2017.
1011 2018-07-02 21:49:07 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
1012 2018-07-02 21:49:03 If American companies "steal" resources like water, oil, etc. then have the Mexican govt stop them from doing so. Why would the Mexican government allow this to happen? And if there are "illegal aliens" who retire in Mexico, then why doesn't Mexico deport these "illegal aliens"?
1013 2018-07-02 21:49:00 I just slipped on oil with two buckets of ice in my hands and I'm pretty sure I just broke my kneecaps 
1014 2018-07-02 21:48:56 I didn't ask them to violate the law, cross illegally and use up my tax money to track them down, capture and hold them. 
Why shouldn't they pay?
1015 2018-07-02 21:48:54 LRT friends with anxiety should check out last rt bc cbd oil helps sooo much and it’s usually quite pricey too. i recommend it 1000x
1016 2018-07-02 21:48:52 Does that warm feeling follow through the supply chain and distribution system's that would see the cost of just about everything rise, every service, every product?  Include other variables, like a weakening £ and oil being priced in $. The oil price could rise substantially!
1017 2018-07-02 21:48:52 We Love them!!!!!!!!   The oil smells like a summer breeze! 
1018 2018-07-02 21:48:47 I usually do a “douche” of some apple cider vinegar + a couple drops of tea tree oil + fill the rest of the bottle up w/filtered water & that always sets my girl back to normal pH Good luck w/the bby making
1019 2018-07-02 21:48:45 I suppose it all depends what is in the fluid. Essential oils can be dangerous if used undiluted. They can cause cardiac, skin and eye damage if used incorrectly and when used for aromatherapy I believe they need to be added to a carrier oil. So vaping, best of a bad deal?
1020 2018-07-02 21:48:37 Just wasted an hour of my life since @Valvoline was slacking, and my car is STILL not inspected nor has the oil been changed. #Beautiful  Where else can I go for oil changes & inspections in the Fishkill/Beacon area?
1021 2018-07-02 21:48:35 If you live your life for the clicks/likes,  it takes more and more insanity to entice people to take the clickbait...

1023 2018-07-02 21:48:01 ***MERGER ALERT*** $CEI 10-k, no debt, assets and sitting on billions worth of oil. Price target $5 when merger news is confirmed. Possible 8 bagger overnight....hints have been dropped all weekend about the merger. Whale sharks will be all over this company for buyout!!
1024 2018-07-02 21:47:59 Unku Oya answer
1025 2018-07-02 21:47:56 Ssh! Don't want them to discover that the London Sewers project is really just a cover story to secretly build two giant pipes to Scotland in order to transport oil from the secret oil fields in the Clyde, and to drain all the water from the lochs.
1026 2018-07-02 21:47:53 We're not built for this weather... but I'd take it over oil skins any day 
1027 2018-07-02 21:47:51 I got really paranoid when I saw a picture of me from behind and it looked like I had a bald spot. Time to buy some caster oil
1028 2018-07-02 21:47:45 Popped some popcorn on the stove. Added Chipotle olive oil, white cheddar and cheesey jalapeño seasoning. I'm in heaven
1029 2018-07-02 21:47:44 Oil and water do not mix.  Black and white people do not mix.
1030 2018-07-02 21:47:44 Stupid how quick prices go up when oil goes up and wholesale goes up, but prices never come down as quick!! A lot of garages have already put prices back up by at least 1p some 2p!! Seen couple of garages who never lowered theirs in the first place!!
1031 2018-07-02 21:47:44 Pretty sure they’re cool with our military. Pretty sure they’re cool with billions in oil subsidies.

Just retired from oil and gas business
1036 2018-07-02 21:46:48 This is another one of @realDonaldTrump 's side effect,  policies. Oil and other fossil fuels are the commodities of the past. This environment must be preserved and renewable alternatives sought.
1037 2018-07-02 21:46:47 Mine too. The longer the oil price stays above $75 it’s a bonus
1038 2018-07-02 21:46:41 Not qualified to be President of the National Oil Corporation

1043 2018-07-02 21:46:14 Loosen restriction on the old oil rail tank cars for 12 months. There is still capacity constraint as not enough new crash resistant cars have entered the rail system yet.
1044 2018-07-02 21:46:10 Gas goes stale. Check your oil. A new spark plug will fix a specific problem. 1/100 times it is the spark plug.
1045 2018-07-02 21:45:59 Who sells oil

1048 2018-07-02 21:45:39 No. Its just peeling and feels really dry. I am using coconut oil.

1052 2018-07-02 21:45:25 I shoulda waited to get this damn oil changed. Smh
1053 2018-07-02 21:45:24 How exactly is it socialism when over 80% is employed by the private sector? 

And how are we a capitalist society when we have free public education, medicare, medicaid and unemployment benefits?

Venezuela has failed because their economy was too depended of oil
1054 2018-07-02 21:45:11 Obviously not Conservatives. Yes Chuck get your ppl in line.
1055 2018-07-02 21:45:09 How about the statements from Energy Minister regarding free-market pricing for crude #oil and #naturalgas?
1056 2018-07-02 21:45:08 I agree. It's almost like the government doesn't care about them since they just send them into wars in foreign countries to secure oil. American soldiers haven't fought a battle on American soil for many generations. You're not fighting for 'freedom'. You're fighting for money.
1057 2018-07-02 21:45:05 I'm home! And my iced coffee from the freezer is the perfect amount of iced.  I left my smaller fan at my brother's house so he can fix it. Well, oil it, actually. Which of course means I have to go back over there to pick it up in a day or two. If only I had wings.

1063 2018-07-02 21:44:09 I wonder if @noellecrombie is going to write about the social costs? For instance,  the $9.6 million spent on initial care of 71 burn victims of hash oil explosions from July 2015 to January of 2018?
1064 2018-07-02 21:43:57 Shit was a mixture of rubbing alcohol & castor oil

1074 2018-07-02 21:42:31 Certain areas where we should not be drilling for oil - too long of a list for me to mention. My sister recently said people are now upset because his whole coal idea was a joke (she's in coal country Kentucky)

1081 2018-07-02 21:41:36 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1082 2018-07-02 21:41:31 Thanks lovely. Not really! As I’ve got older I wearmuch less products, I do a lot of working out which makes me glow so sometimes I use powder to get rid of oil, especially on my nose lol X
1083 2018-07-02 21:41:18 If we can run trucks off coconut oil, we can find a solution.

1090 2018-07-02 21:40:16 Forgive me. I know literally nothing about #LoveIsland save for its existence. But I do know about the searing cranial pain of a mustard oil massage after a haircut in Lahore. Very luxuriant locks after, though.
1091 2018-07-02 21:40:07 Endless oil story
1092 2018-07-02 21:40:06 One of the most important if not crucial components to Americas survival and economic strength is low fuel costs.Fuel costs control ALL BUYING POWER for every person in existence.Mass travel and product buying is greatly affected by high fuel costs.Why are we getting oil abroad!
1093 2018-07-02 21:39:59 This I did not know about Canada. Me duh?   "The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%)."
1094 2018-07-02 21:39:53 European industrial startups are scaling up production of Blue Crude. Renewable power sources to reduce and recombine CO2 and H2O into something akin to crude oil. A CO2 neutral hydrocarbon mix to run through the old fossil fuel refineries.
1095 2018-07-02 21:39:45 I gotta replace my tires like all 4 cuz the thread is just done now plus my tire sensor thingy and oil change it’s nothing major but all this shit is hitting me at once so it’s running my pockets fr

1103 2018-07-02 21:39:00 Okay so I'm frying up some white onions in coconut oil and lemme just say y'all this smell is LIFE
1104 2018-07-02 21:38:57 So all those bankruptcies are ok?  Sounds like a terrible businessman but a great snake oil salesman. I noticed that Scotland told him where to get off on that hotel deal at Old Course St. Andrews.
1105 2018-07-02 21:38:56 Smart people. Never buy the hype, we can help real "refugees" near their homeland such as in Libya.... just back up the oil tankers; sell the oil and rebuild.
1106 2018-07-02 21:38:53 The way some girls like guys with cars, you will think they were breastfed with engine oil
1107 2018-07-02 21:38:41 I first heard about @PetroRiverOil from @jaltucher in 2012. I then met  the CEO Scot Cohen in NY a few years later. Plan of drilling oil at low cost in the Osage has been executed flawlessly as the last 2 PRs show. Once Wall Street finds out about $PTRC the stock should explode
1108 2018-07-02 21:38:33 Condoms, a 6 pack of Haynes tag less tees, a cinnabun, and some beard oil. Thanks boo
1109 2018-07-02 21:38:30 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

1111 2018-07-02 21:38:23 This is my conviction about him that he meant well for Nigeria. Not like your heros that see Nigeria as their company and milking it dry, owning oil wells here and there without merits and possessing the entire country.
1112 2018-07-02 21:38:18 How much oil & gas to we get from Canada via NAFTA's "preferential access"?
We also get the majority of their hockey players.
1113 2018-07-02 21:38:09 #insidetheamericanembassy odd (!) how one of most oil rich countries i.e. Saudi Arabi is not on the list, despite it being the largest international sponsor of Islamist militant groups. Instead a list is constructed purely for publicity purposes under the guise of "protection"
1114 2018-07-02 21:38:00 Some maybe. While good that it’s more competitive per barrel, overall costs including decommissioning still expensive. It’s the relative cost vs other locations that matters. Saudi oil can be $10 for example. When oil gets much above $50-$70 USA ramp up shale production.

1119 2018-07-02 21:36:42 Global oil prices will sink, Canada's consumption is significantly less and refining capacity will suffice. Prices at the pump in Canada will either sink or stay flat.

The U.S will see a several dollar per gallon spike at the pump there's not enough domestic supply. Crippling.
1120 2018-07-02 21:36:41 Leave us alone . We will change the lace closure, add baby oil to the wig and rock it.

1122 2018-07-02 21:36:27 Mr Hubby drives a 2003 Chevy Silverado. Loves it. No bells or whistles. He had a 1991 Silverado stepside standard that he restored. It was stolen. Thief once worked for us. He painted an ugly grey stripe from front to tale then jumped a stump & busted the oil pan. We cried.
1123 2018-07-02 21:36:21 ugh juss finish changing the oil in our car and the two guys both with one hand each WHO COULDNT DO IT yelled at me the whhhoooolllleeeee time ....i'm tired of being the man

1125 2018-07-02 21:35:54 Cbd oil may help. You can get it there or online. I find it so helpful
1126 2018-07-02 21:35:53 I would also add, that we need to either update or build new refineries in the U.S. However, his actual plan is to distract his base and the great majority of people have no interest in knowing about oil flows or grades,just price at pump. The simpler the explanation the better
1127 2018-07-02 21:35:50 #TheFive I paid my own way thru school and even my daughter insisted on paying her own way along w/scholarships. I just found out she's going 4 her masters now. Very PROUD of her. 1 son drives a train and rest of us in oil/gas industry.

1129 2018-07-02 21:35:36 Extra Virgin Olive Oil should only be used on salads, if you use it for cooking it's baaaaaaaaad. As soon as it hits a certain temperature it smokes and all the good traits go out of it leaving all the shite. 

Cook with Rapeseed Oil.

1132 2018-07-02 21:35:20 I’ve been known to trash an engine for failing to check the oil. True story
1133 2018-07-02 21:35:02 Isn't cream the young rabbit girl? Dauther of vanilla.

WHY IS TAIL'S OIL IN HER!!!!
Danger alert
1134 2018-07-02 21:35:00 Castor oil then "Mister alba" ( as most would say)- alba has that deep menthol that leaves your heart dogging in regret after drinking
1135 2018-07-02 21:34:57 Any of you take Carbon 60 oil? CBD oil?
Wowsers... I'm seeing huge difference!
1136 2018-07-02 21:34:46 Sometimes I even get jealous, how some guys r lucky to hv my sisters ,cos my dad doesn't condone discrimination and nothing near materialistic, but u go go another house them go dey do u anyhow
1137 2018-07-02 21:34:32 I'm not sure everyone who knows anything about the issues agrees with blanket disinvestment. Nor does the Oxford motion recommend this. We do need to work together to reduce the demand for oil and gas as well as promote renewables in the supply chain.
1138 2018-07-02 21:34:24 Hahah. Try using the Argon Oil Mousse. When it dries it down flake or dry your hair out. It holds your curl.

1145 2018-07-02 21:34:08 Indeed.

The high-stakes trolling instills anger & fear in neighbors, and the locals love it (RUS a superpower).

Every referenced nation was part of Soviet Union.

Putin rules an aging populace, infrastructure, surrounded by NATO allies.

Oil keeps him in power until it doesn't.
1146 2018-07-02 21:34:05 just drink 15 gallons of apple cider vinegar per day and rub coconut oil on your eyelids and you be chillin girl!
1147 2018-07-02 21:34:04 Well let's see besides Canada there is the EU China England and Mexico all hitting red state products with tariffs so I say we are pretty good we have other trading partners the above mentioned and TPP which you are not part of. We also supply 40% of your oil we can sit it off

1156 2018-07-02 21:32:13 Did @JustinTrudeau seriously not add a tariff to our oil exports to USA?

1161 2018-07-02 21:31:55 Maybe we can release something similar, like "corrections", like "do not use essential oil without specific clearance from your veterinarian. Your average #essentialoil salesperson is NOT qualified to give such advice."

1168 2018-07-02 21:31:20 that's the serious exception here, because no nation on Earth knows such enormous effect of "massive worldwide orders"-it was such strong impulse that even Putin's Russia received $4+ trillions from oil demand by China-which fulfilling the orders to all planet Trump will end this

1185 2018-07-02 21:29:32 Bottom line is that the best and most effective way that Alberta and Canada can reduce harm to the global environment is to supply as much of the worldwide demand for oil and gas as possible; produced here cleanly and responsibly, offsetting eco-disastrous production elsewhere.
1186 2018-07-02 21:29:27 Ya trump,you also think the Saudis are going to increase production of oil for trump NOT, another trump LIE !

1194 2018-07-02 21:27:41 Also read that he doesnt want to import oil from the US. I dont understand that mentality. Its not good for the US economy obviously. And the fact that he wants more oil facilities is somewhat alarming to me as an environmentalist. But I also dont have a clear idea on this matter
1195 2018-07-02 21:27:41 I find it strange how every time I need an oil change, the first 5 places I call are all booked this week and next week. Smh
1196 2018-07-02 21:27:40 Oh great, the deterrents are working.
1197 2018-07-02 21:27:23 To us lives of people much more important than money and oil so keep the good work and pressure against this regime, and get complete support. Economic pressures will stop or hinder Iran terrorist plans. They are worse than ISIS

1202 2018-07-02 21:26:30 The price of oil is widely expected to rise substantially in Q2/3 2019 due to major supply constraints ( Iran, Venezuela, Libya ), the government are making a big mistake hiking fuel duty, calamity or an embarrassing climb down will ensue 
1203 2018-07-02 21:26:27 Signals’re clear #USA squeezes all conflicting #Gulf states and steers them to areas their forefathers objected to

Asks them to pump more oil, too

After it had squeezed their bank accounts

#Yemen is lost and has nothing to be squeezed for

Only squeezes of folding up and pain

1213 2018-07-02 21:25:29 Also his policy on oil seems like a fire starter. I agree with ending monopolies, I just hope his policies dont make Mexico a victim of the oil cartels. Also, to my knowledge Mexico is the 10th largest producer of oil & I hope his actions dont raise the price of oil.

1258 2018-07-02 21:19:38 You are completely right. And it makes me cross that other people think that we are to 'blame' when our behaviour is different or difficult. We try our best, but some days are like climbing a wall covered in oil
1259 2018-07-02 21:19:13 We move oil in BFO tankers, coz oil's dear innit and has an in'lt market, so it's worth moving it in BFO tankers.  How much does a barrel of of water cost? Gas is, well, gas - which means it can be compressed.  

Water is fuckin heavy stuff.  A cubic metre weighs a metric tonne.

1268 2018-07-02 21:18:08 Uh his dad Vito opened Genco olive oil and in the book owned lots of stores. a chocolate factory opened by the mob makes more sense than Leia flying thru space or Force Ghost interacting manipulating lightning which retcons all the other episodes!
1269 2018-07-02 21:18:08 This is the same snake oil they sold the Venezuelan people. Look at them now
1270 2018-07-02 21:18:00 And remember his ‘B-r-i-t-I-s-h Petroleum jibe when that oil disaster occurred. Some friend of the uk he is.

1276 2018-07-02 21:17:28 Uh, the tarrifs directly demolishing the heartland are taking effect in two days.

Also Venezuela is a lazy argument oil is their only revenue...try bashing the terrible socialist policies of many successful Western European nations and get back to me you half-wit.
1277 2018-07-02 21:17:12 It just takes a little Olive Oil and some cinnamon mixed with homeric to open veins and arteries and reduce cholesterol and the chance of having a heart attack.
1278 2018-07-02 21:17:09 I need to change my oil but that shit gone cost me like 80$ it should I bust a number and let somebody else do it 
1279 2018-07-02 21:17:06 There's almost two years since Obama left and new government hasn't do anything about it. And yes, you horrifying colonizing companies steal water, oil and minerals everyday in Mexican territory and believe it or not there are a lot illegal aliens who retired in Mexico.
1280 2018-07-02 21:16:55 Like an oil slick!!!
1281 2018-07-02 21:16:52 The fuck? Changing oil is literally the easiest thing to do on a car, it doesn’t need that much labour cost
1282 2018-07-02 21:16:39 It should be mandatory to show footage of oil spills and Deep Horizon spewing into the Gulf of Mexico on those TVs they put on the gas pumps.
1283 2018-07-02 21:16:38 Read answer above again! They didn't eat more carbs yrs ago. Neither did they eat ready meals & processed junk foods & sugary canned drinks.

1287 2018-07-02 21:15:36 Getting my oil changed rn
1288 2018-07-02 21:15:24 I need a hairstylist who gone wash , oil, and do my hair ,not one that's charging me 150 plus for a sew in and want me to come already washed and de tangled and still don't want to put no oil in my hair

1306 2018-07-02 21:13:20 Funny how one claims to crack down on corruption then brings someone tainted by corruption to be an advisor.

Of course an Aramcon is tapped to build Neom. Though it will be tough to succeed, if anyone there can it will be an oil man

1312 2018-07-02 21:11:48 @SusanBlumMD - I got rid of my arthritis in both hands- fingers-joints with cod liver oil from the book: "Arthritis and Common Sense" by Dale Alexander (his mother was bedridden w/ arthritis - farmers + olden folks told him cod liver oil - his mom got out of bed + walked again!
1313 2018-07-02 21:11:39 Are you kidding? He doesn't give a crap  about the environment other than to destroy it to get to oil!
1314 2018-07-02 21:11:30 Texas needs quarterly revenue forecasts. The #TXLege ignored collapsing oil rig count long enough to cut big corporate taxes in 2015. Then they ignored the oil rebound long enough to cut school funding in 2017.
1315 2018-07-02 21:11:06 This time, it is not about oil!
1316 2018-07-02 21:11:04 I think I have MCT oil somewhere
1317 2018-07-02 21:10:50 What are that lot of socialist oil countries? Anyway, the fact that they rank higher in HDI than GDP cannot be explained by oil, that's a measure of how they use the money they have, not how much money they have.
1318 2018-07-02 21:10:47 By now the pilots are washing, gauging the oil and warming three airplanes against tomorrow.... It gonna be a long voyage from Russia.

1321 2018-07-02 21:10:39 Well, I used the unflavored coconut oil (it’s like liquid oil instead of the clumpy kind), so it didn’t taste like coconut at all! But you have to be careful what kind you use 
1322 2018-07-02 21:10:38 Nothing pleases me more than when a pt asks if I’m good at something upon entering the room to perform a task. I didn’t go to school for 5 years and accumulate 30k in debt to fucking suck at my job. I don’t ask the mechanic if he’s good at changing oil

1327 2018-07-02 21:09:41 Let me get this straight, the gov collects royalties at a rate of 12.5% on oil/gas drilled in federal land with a goal of funding deferred maintenance of $12 billion. Oil/gas would have to net around 10 trillion dollars. Seems impossible.
1328 2018-07-02 21:09:40 Shell or oil Libya!
1329 2018-07-02 21:09:37 Well...first the dinosaurs died and they all turned to oil...then...

1334 2018-07-02 21:08:46 I'll admit, I was fooled for a long time back then.
1335 2018-07-02 21:08:42 ... Hmmm. But our work often fits into the use or adoption of those approaches, sometimes helping to oil the cogs of transformation. A bit like what we're doing with Mind and their digital strategy.
1336 2018-07-02 21:08:33 I thought the same thing! I have purple in my long hair and I use coconut or jojoba oil to keep it moisturized..
1337 2018-07-02 21:08:27 Given a PE ratio of 8 to 20 for oil/gas companies ... where do you see the market cap?
1338 2018-07-02 21:08:25 Idk what was in that natural coconut oil but that shit wasn’t natural

1343 2018-07-02 21:08:01 We as Americans need to invade Mexico  set up camp we want equality in boarder crossings $$$ Mexico can start paying for US citizens food, jobs, if they can’t we take thier oil, for exchange of taking care of thier people!!

1346 2018-07-02 21:07:49 @MondayMusicQuiz #MondayMusicQuiz @Melonhead999 cadbury’s chocolate is terrible now. They changed the recipe and put stuff like palm oil in it. Tastes like sh!t.

1351 2018-07-02 21:07:16 Snake oil sales with free advertising now. Awesome.
1352 2018-07-02 21:06:57 you will never smell the scent of oil and petrol burned. you will never have the excitement of the 2t engine ;)

1355 2018-07-02 21:06:12 The piece that the article is missing is that China was filling up reserves as well as building them while oil prices were low over the last couple of years. PMI was 0.1 lower than last month.
1356 2018-07-02 21:05:33 Hey how's it going and I have suffered from depression and anxiety and I take evening primrose oil and vitamin B6 which has really helped me and I feel so much more relaxed now and it's great you talking about mental health 
1357 2018-07-02 21:05:30 NOV 4th When Iran sells oil to China, Turkey & Europe? We go to war with Iran? I guess Israel is gonna take the hit for false evidence of WMD this time? The USD is on a fast track to devalue. Todays tough trade talk is panic our allies wont defend the USD$  4 false flag attacks
1358 2018-07-02 21:05:29 We worked hard to bring more healthcare to millions, to bring reps to bank CEOs to prevent another recession. @GOP @POTUS is the one removing all refs and letting the banks, oil Barron’s destroy our earth, healthcare, finances&  industry. Why is that?

1360 2018-07-02 21:05:25 The main driver for opposition towards hillary in the Oil Region, where I'm from, was her support of TPP and connections to big money players. It wasn't sexism. The region was scorched when NAFTA went through and TPP was worse.

1366 2018-07-02 21:04:51 CBD is honestly the best. It helps so much with pain and anxiety. It calms me down. I use the gummy bears because the taste of the oil is awful, but it works so well!! 10/10 recommended.

1374 2018-07-02 21:04:01 Idk why but every time I go to get my oil change I anticipate spending like $30 but I end up spending well over $200. Now do you see why I don’t like getting my oil changed?
1375 2018-07-02 21:03:57 Lol!  Trust me when I say if you've ever tasted cod liver oil in liquid form...it's extremely difficult to even swallow the gel capsules.
1376 2018-07-02 21:03:41 I use coconut oil?
1377 2018-07-02 21:03:39 A lot of people have no idea how massive our economy is and how much of it is driven by oil that the can’t see. Those of us in the industry just look like pawns of the oil tycoon overloads to them. Even when we are encouraging of renewable energy sources.
1378 2018-07-02 21:03:34 Stay away from England 
When you want water there's none !
When you don't want water you can't hold it

1389 2018-07-02 21:01:09 Are natives being killed? No. Is there land being taken from them in the interest of international oil companies? Yes. Are they being arrested for protesting that? Yes. Is there a huge issue with missing, raped and murdered native women in this country thats going unsolved? Yes
1390 2018-07-02 21:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or the crime.

1407 2018-07-02 20:59:26 Why is there any more drilling needed?. We have solar, wind, water, and sources already exists for natural gas. We are destroying our world for the benefit of oil companies. We are at war to take oil from other countries. Does ANYONE think this is right.
1408 2018-07-02 20:59:25 Been seeing smart phones that people forgot everywhere. First was on the floor at my room mates work. Next was at the Habit during lunch sitting at a table. Then I go to go get my oil changed and there is another one laying on a chair. If it starts ringing I'm running.

1411 2018-07-02 20:58:58 In hindsight, tanning oil probably wasn’t the best idea.
1412 2018-07-02 20:58:46 PLUS coming from someone who has worked at a gas station, the price of gas actually rises for the consumers months before the price of oil increases. Its the way stores insure their profits.
1413 2018-07-02 20:58:34 I know those raw cashew and almond butters are really fashionable and I concede they’re tasty, but imagine how good they’d be with sugar and/or salt, oil and monosodium glutamate

1424 2018-07-02 20:57:06 Most socialist countries have a state oil fund that they use to pay for the bulk of their infrastructure.  They also have populations and land area the size of some states but people get greedy and voters become complacent and countries go broke like Venezuela under Chavez.

1442 2018-07-02 20:55:37 so many patients I meet tell of all the adverse effects of the addictive narcotics they're prescribed for pain management, but not a single patient has had a bad experience with CBD oil and/or synthetic THC as a replacement & all have had the same or more relief of their symptoms
1443 2018-07-02 20:55:24 I AM NOT saying Bush did 9/11 and invaded Iraq for oil, all I'm saying is that jet fuel can't melt steel beams and his oil buddies did really well after the invasion.

1478 2018-07-02 20:51:33 I can bear testimony to that, my A3 had first a leaking radiator,  the harness had to be changed because the car could not select gears, then megatronics had to be changed and two weeks after leaving the repairs it was a oil switch. All in a space of four months.

1543 2018-07-02 20:44:04 get on something with so many side effects that also would never even treat the actual issue, but cause more problems, while exasperating the original issue in the first place!! Generally, I then solve it at home with things like honey or coconut oil and change in diet good grief
1544 2018-07-02 20:44:04 Wonder if there's oil under that land?  A nice oil drill would be perfect right in that spot.

1551 2018-07-02 20:42:47 Sara was bustin your chops on that soccer goal color commentary! The reason Sauds aren't dumping oil now is they don't have much left. They have small cushion now, but need to wait to see how market reacts. Too much underinvestment over last few years to make up ground! #bakken

1561 2018-07-02 20:41:39 Nice is getting hostages out of Iran. Nice is sending our troops to die on the field in battles we didn't start. Trade is business and it's not our fault that your boss is a crooked, con man and we're too smart to buy his snake oil!

"Wishaw General cost £100m to build but will pay back £813m for the PFI contract by 2029. 

It’s Labour’s debt. It’s Gordon Brown’s DEBT legacy on the SNHS." 

Norway has a £1 TRILLION state investment oil fund - where is our oil fund for the many Gordon?

1583 2018-07-02 20:39:12 Meestal hinkt de WTI-prijs voor crude oil zo'n $6à$8 achter op de Brent. Nu is dat slechts $3 ($74-$77). Dat is het gevolg vd mindere US shale-oil productie en lagere US import uit Iran.
1584 2018-07-02 20:39:01 This weekend the American people will travel for the 4th. Corporations have brain washed us to spend once a month. We work to hand it to the oil companies. Stay home and meet your neighbors. Brush off your own doorstep.

1587 2018-07-02 20:38:54 You just did.  The world has closed an eye, yet the G8 and the UN are defending their interests (oil) with no one daring Israel to stop bleeding violence. It's painful in deed.

1590 2018-07-02 20:38:30 You know that hypocrite didn’t. She hate capitalism but using the very products produce by it. Hates the oil and gas industry but uses the very products produced by it. Typical regressive leftist who assumes they own the moral high ground.
1591 2018-07-02 20:38:30 And looking all oil up like she came from frying. Every needed to throw poor jab
1592 2018-07-02 20:38:18 No. The blank spots are dead retinal tissue. My periphery is screwed from the oil, which has to stay in to keep my eye stable. This is all I have for the rest of my life, and I may eventually be totally blind, though hopefully not for a few years.

Socialist ideas do work, we se this in many countries in Europe and in the United States too. Venezuela has a dictator and an economy based sold on oil, no one says it's great.
1595 2018-07-02 20:37:53 On the bright side, it might spark a little interest in oil and gas history.

1667 2018-07-02 20:28:20 You need to do your own research, google how UK compared to Norway on oil but Norway having a 1trillion sovereign wealth fund as I've already pointed out to you should have been sufficient
1668 2018-07-02 20:28:16 It also soaks up oil spills.
1669 2018-07-02 20:28:15 What energy is it exporting? Last figures I saw had the US in 14th place for oil exports, 7th for natural gas and 4th for coal.  In fact the increase in coal production and shale extraction is causing the US even greater climate change problems.
1670 2018-07-02 20:28:09 Hopefully this competition is good for consumers as they race to dominate the market. IMO Oil and Gas are on the back foot.

1680 2018-07-02 20:26:50 Thank you! I think that is what has been my problem. I take a lot of flax oil every day per my rheumatologist

1683 2018-07-02 20:26:13 Refine the product here for Pete's sake. Convert to oil. Store it here like the big storage facility in Texas.
1684 2018-07-02 20:26:13 There is no conflict! ITIL is a vast body of guidance, DevOps is a resourcing / Lean technique. It's like saying a car (ITIL) is in conflict with engine oil (DevOps).
1685 2018-07-02 20:26:11 Gotta get oil change on my Camry today and my breaks done on the Malibu ... so I’m basically careless until 6
1686 2018-07-02 20:25:45 Is @RSPOtweets certified “sustainable” palm oil truly sustainable? If you think labor exploitation is sustainable then yes. #EURT2018
1687 2018-07-02 20:25:36 No les quiere quitar las propinas, quiere que tributen por ellas. Con eso y la subida del gas oil a los trabajadores pretende arreglar España. Ahora le falta subir las cuotas de la S. S. a los autónomos y destopar las de los trabajadores por cta. ajena. #Asigobiernaelpsoe.
1688 2018-07-02 20:25:36 Can we talk about cbd oil?  Miracle stuff for so many.  I'm flabbergasted by medicine's unwillingness to incorporate homeopathy.
1689 2018-07-02 20:25:33 I primarily use it when I’m not wearing makeup. And if I am wearing makeup, I’ll first oil cleanse to remove it then use the micellar water. I go through about 1 bottle every 6 weeks with twice daily use.
1690 2018-07-02 20:25:27 I hope that will include oil so we can pay less for patrol.
1691 2018-07-02 20:25:13 Its getting ridiculous. Look at the stuff I sent you guys earlier this morning. Oil is way more expensive for Chinese refineries now.
1692 2018-07-02 20:25:09 One of the best tips I've ever heard is mixing sweet things with sharp olive oil. The taste's heavenly.
1693 2018-07-02 20:24:57 I sense my neighbour analogy may have been a bit subtle for you. You do seem a bit intellectually 'differently enabled'.
To simplify, Scotland is only liked by England when England can get cheap food, water, oil and renewable energy from Scotland.
Otherwise England hates Scotland
1694 2018-07-02 20:24:50 1) A recent USGS study found that the Eagle Ford Shale contains 8.5 billion barrels of oil.

1699 2018-07-02 20:24:40 Uhhhh. I skimmed the article and it doesn’t appear to say anything about providing money for overseas oil spill cleanup.

1701 2018-07-02 20:24:35 いい試合だった。けど負けちゃ駄目なんだよ。。負けは負け。
1702 2018-07-02 20:24:35 Not really. This is in reference to gender analysis from the budget. They want to have more women working in oil & other male dominated trades but gotta protect women too. E.g. higher rate of assaults against women in rural areas where oil workers fly in.
1703 2018-07-02 20:24:20 @channel5_tv #Insidethechocolatefactory, What a pity that @CadburyUK puts oil into the chocolate and cut back on the cocoa solids to save money and retain profit. Cadbury milk used to 'snap' now it bends.

1707 2018-07-02 20:23:41 Pele. It can be frustrating. Maybe a quarterly trip to Bronx Terminal for the main things & family can bring the rest. So long as I have garri, original palm oil, egusi and ground crayfish, I'm good. Lol.
1708 2018-07-02 20:23:35 I heard multiple pieces of tech NASA employs still use whale oil, maybe we should try this instead?
1709 2018-07-02 20:23:27 Baby oil isn’t, petroleum jelly is! Always thoroughly rinse your suit after each use no matter where you’ve been
1710 2018-07-02 20:23:12 Unreal.  Watched it while I was getting my oil changed.  Almost shook the car.

1714 2018-07-02 20:22:16 I take Linseed oil because it has omega 3, and a vitamin B complex and I find that to help, also ice, I ice my elbows every night!

1718 2018-07-02 20:21:59 For the apple & fennel salad - extra virgin olive oil, lemon & salt! 
Cos salad is - mustard powder, vegan honey (we use @SweetFreedom ) organic cider vinegar, extra virgin olive oil & salt

1721 2018-07-02 20:21:16 Venezuela was a mess b4 Chavez and he made it worse. Anyways, didn't he claim the US as enemy? If so, I'd have cut oil purchases from Venezuela as we don't have to do biz w enemies. Sadly we didn't so that.
1722 2018-07-02 20:21:04 You might be right. There's less revenue in #recyclable materials now than was, with less demand starting with #China's controls. Previous dips in #oil £ (now on the up) had made virgin #plastic cheaper too.
Incentivised like DRS maybe the answer. As well as reduction.
1723 2018-07-02 20:20:54 My girl started with baby oil shave.
What a bitch to clean the shower tho.
1724 2018-07-02 20:20:52 It was a great place to grow up, but is now a good place to be from.  Fracking is bringing some new jobs and new life to the oil and gas industry, but it is still very depressed.  By the way, it is home to Zippo lighters and Case knives, as well as to the Holley carb.
1725 2018-07-02 20:20:48 Ofcourse they are.  Next,  Oil lobbyists will be circling around politicians to get their agenda against electric vehicles going. It won’t be a surprise.

1730 2018-07-02 20:19:55 Ok so I patted my forehead with vinegar and rubbed some coconut oil on it it feels better now

1732 2018-07-02 20:19:43 @geography_411 . As if this administration doesn't have its hands full with the Russia investigation this super highway would also include oil and gas in its development which again would seem to give people the idea that business would be the primary reason for this highway.

You bomb the continent that we live in because you want oil, power and money so you can finance the drugs that you want. Then you complain that we are trying to...

1742 2018-07-02 20:19:01 You apply a water based serum with humectants (glycerin, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera gel, urea etc) and then to moisturize, you apply a heavier cream-like product or an oil on top to seal in the moisture and prevent transepidermal water loss.

1779 2018-07-02 20:15:19 Sure! I blitz it up with some garlic, oil, maybe basil/chilli. Cook the pasta as usual and toast pine nuts/cook some broccoli or peas/whatever I want in it. Then combine at the end and add feta if you feel like it! It’s usually if I’m not feeling like heavy cheesiness or meat.

1786 2018-07-02 20:14:32 But, for crude oil, he is right though, as only crude oil price is something voters could understand.

1794 2018-07-02 20:13:37 Thanks dear Melanie Gouby. The real problem is the French oil company Total which is courts the Kabila regime and protects these criminals. Oil in Virunga will be exploited but with a more responsible Government which will impose environmentally sound practices to the operator
1795 2018-07-02 20:13:36 I'm really hoping that one of your book projects has something to do with yours experiences working in the oil fields. You mentioned this once in a podcast and you seem to have some stories to tell.

1797 2018-07-02 20:13:16 This is actually quite common! Focus on hydrating your eyes and moisturizing them with an eye serum followed by an eye cream. Alternatively, a hyaluronic acid serum followed by a light layer of avocado oil.
1798 2018-07-02 20:13:11 Just dolly them up and fry them in a little oil on the stove? I’ve only purchased them pre-packaged

1801 2018-07-02 20:12:54 oh wow. do you have to use antimacassars to protect furniture etc, or does the oil not readily transfer?

1803 2018-07-02 20:12:37 In my eyes? If I dared to imagine Cuba without the Castro's Cuba would blone or the strongest economies in latin america instead of being a parasite living off the soviets first and Venezuela's oil most recently.
1804 2018-07-02 20:12:25 Maybe if we want to help turn the obesity crisis around we need to stop TV chefs glugging olive oil over everything they serve?! 
1805 2018-07-02 20:12:15 What about hydro power all these floods we need pipelines for that instead of oil taken from the earth
1806 2018-07-02 20:12:13 There seems to be a concerted effort against all green initiatives in this country. Same applies to labour unions against alternative energy suppliers. At the risk of sounding ‘conspitorial’ this maybe the Old Oil Mafia pulling the loose ANC government strings

1808 2018-07-02 20:11:44 Not ‘the people’ though is it? More like a few faux activists with nothing better to do. Where do you suggest the U.K. gets the oil it needs from? Where better than from an non fracking, environmental aware U.K. business?

1820 2018-07-02 20:09:48 Coconut oil is the best thing. Cook with it.  Eat it. Whiten your teeth with it.  Moisturize with it. Steal your man with it.
1821 2018-07-02 20:09:44 Automobiles are far dirtier and infrastructure to support the gasoline combustion engine that most cars run on is much more damaging to the environment.  Not to mention the incredible geo-political havoc oil has wrought.
1822 2018-07-02 20:09:28 Presently she poured oil on the pursuit of limb, quickly jumped into her teeth with spite; then you in the girl's father
1823 2018-07-02 20:09:27 This company used to be own by Lady Bird Johnson and they made a killing in Vietnam and they are totally in bed with the oil industry! It’s used to be called Brown & Root! My late hubby worked for them!

1840 2018-07-02 20:07:25 Can’t tell you from YT vid but do notice that much of a very concentrated oil was given suggesting a high dose.
1841 2018-07-02 20:07:23 It's been done. Google "Corco Puerto Rico". A US Territory refinery that had to buy oil on the open market couldn't compete with stateside refineries, especially as oil prices rose. In the 70's, before shale oil. Oh, and it left the land useless afterwards.

1851 2018-07-02 20:06:09 If you educate people, they embrace liberal ideology. If you keep them ignorant, they stay conservative. 

The greedy rich (big oil, big pharma, etc), instead of the noble rich (entertainment, technology, etc), love being able to control them as slave labor for cheap.
1852 2018-07-02 20:06:08 We cannot let life die because of oil and money. We must let oil and money pass away so that life can thrive. #climatechange @350
1853 2018-07-02 20:06:04 Why anyone would think that reconstituted milk would be better than fresh milk in any case baffles me, but having palm and coconut oil in a product being passed off as dairy is incredible hoodwinking. There isnt even real cream in ice cream these days either!
1854 2018-07-02 20:05:53 And I can never leave and oil change without needing 62 extra repairs done too  #JustTakeAllMyMoney

1857 2018-07-02 20:05:28 Cuz an oil pipeline has literally nothing to do with electricity.
1858 2018-07-02 20:05:26 @pulte Hey, Bill, I was just thinking about an idea I've had for awhile: Wouldn't it be great if we could get inner city kids and apprentice them to the oil producers in the Dakotas and elsewhere?

Run the training program initial phase in the formerly-blighted area.

Win-win!
1859 2018-07-02 20:05:18 All I want is an oil change but jiffy lube always finds a way to turn my $49.99 visit to like over $200.. LET ME LIVVE IN PEACE WITH MY SHIT CAR

1864 2018-07-02 20:04:57 I used to dread "peak oil" and the likelihood that one day something cataclysmic would happen and everything would change.

Now I dread the possibility that everything is going to keep going like this forever.
1865 2018-07-02 20:04:32 If “Oil and water do not mix” is true; then how do we have Mayonnaise?

1880 2018-07-02 20:02:58 How is this ok?  Do we need oil that badly?
1881 2018-07-02 20:02:57 I used to use coconut oil as shaving cream until I learned this and then stopped.
1882 2018-07-02 20:02:52 I know that's the first sign but I don't think so. I used my headache oil. I'm gonna drink another bottle of water & see if it helps

1884 2018-07-02 20:02:35 So, to summarize, AB doesn’t give the Federal government more per capita, oh wait, the graph was misleading and now AB is suggesting we don’t want to pay taxes and now it’s Oil and Gas companies that are paying, not AB residents. How did you say it, piss off.
1885 2018-07-02 20:02:32 Dr. Krugman,
 I think about a third of our imports from Canada is oil.  Without that, it looks like we have a large surplus in manufacturing, agriculture & services.  We also have a large deficit w/Saudi Arabia for the same reason.  Why do you think Trump ignores it?
1886 2018-07-02 20:02:30 And in Iran the CIA couped the democratically eleected president Mossadegh, because he wanted to nationalize the oil industry, which British Petroleum didn't like, which lead to the Iran-Iraq war and Saddam Hussein, who was first supported by the U.S. against Iran.
1887 2018-07-02 20:02:28 It worked best when half their division was dumping oil in the driveway.
1888 2018-07-02 20:02:22 Oil changes are such a gamble. “It’ll be about an hour wait” can mean 30 mins or 2+ hours. Today, mine is the latter.
1889 2018-07-02 20:02:18 今日はみんな来るの遅いかもなぁ
1890 2018-07-02 20:01:54 It won’t hurt them because this is what they are and everyone knows it. The worst of DT is what the GOP always has been about. They finally found such a good snake oil salesmen that he was able to brazenly flout the depravity that was always there just under the surface.
1891 2018-07-02 20:01:50 Aha! I did similar with a pizza base at lunch...garlic, oil, tomato, fiery pepper, za'atar, vegan parmesan. Lovely xx

1894 2018-07-02 20:01:38 May I ask you a question: I hear on the Tellie people use oil for their ranges to cook with. Is that natural gas?
1895 2018-07-02 20:01:31 Spatula in one hand, tanning oil in the other.

Oh, we got this!
1896 2018-07-02 20:01:26 I was just talking to the guy at the car place about my oil change and then saw this tweet and broke into an instant t pose, accidentally slapped him in the face. WARN ME

1902 2018-07-02 20:00:44 I would put lavender oil on a handkerchief or a scarf if I was wearing one.
1903 2018-07-02 20:00:41 You worry about the cap space a lot. Oil companies have lots of

1905 2018-07-02 20:00:35 Anywhere to hide or snake oil to sell?
1906 2018-07-02 20:00:32 “Dry ice” and if water had oil or another liquid  in it not mixed in, then it could be considered wet. But we are discussing water itself, not water with another liquid. Wet is when a solid has a liquid on its surface.

1908 2018-07-02 20:00:28 I’m independent and do not view energy as a political issue. U. S. Energy independence is not possible. Simply do the math. We continue to import huge amounts of oil. And we have already depleted most of our cheap oil.
Depletion never sleeps.
1909 2018-07-02 20:00:24 I hate the smell of tea tree oil but if it’s gonna help get rid of the keloid on my nose then I’m all in for it lol

1941 2018-07-02 19:56:11 @tpoletti And when @Tesla is cash flow positive and making a profit, what will be your excuse THEN for continuing to trash the stock? That Teslas don't fly? That they don't have ash trays? That you can't find the dipstick to check the oil?
1942 2018-07-02 19:56:07 I am a common Pakistani with no political affiliation. LNG will reduce crude oil import and will save 2 billion $. It will be used for fertilizer production and will cut another 2 billion $ import of fertilizer.

1947 2018-07-02 19:55:21 It's a favourite @Nigella_Lawson that we have adapted and diverged from over the years. Watermelon, feta, olives, onion, something sour, herbs, olive oil. It's good.
1948 2018-07-02 19:55:16 do I wanna wear my hair bun.. no product.. nothing but just oil & heat protector

1953 2018-07-02 19:54:56 Aligning your beliefs to reality frees up your thinking. Acting in accord with your beliefs increases your options. Putting big oil out of business would unleash our potential.
1954 2018-07-02 19:54:24 The eyebrow ladies tell me to use castor oil.
1955 2018-07-02 19:54:18 Every time my face starts acting up it’s cause I forgot my coconut oil and my water.
1956 2018-07-02 19:54:15 So castor oil works
1957 2018-07-02 19:53:59 Not if the oil tycoons and their lobbyists can stop it.

1961 2018-07-02 19:53:15 Oil companies consider spills to be a loss of product. A loss of profits. But oil is not spilled milk! Oil is a poisonous substance that soaks into the soil, AQUIFERS, water supplies, and everything that drinks that water! Pipelines Leak! and they cannot clean all of it up!
1962 2018-07-02 19:53:12 Way to go Utah anti Trumpers. You fell for the snake oil salesmen.

1964 2018-07-02 19:52:59 He made some sweet, sweet coin off that deal he made when he sold some kind of media company to a Saudi oil prince. Oil money for the win, baby!
1965 2018-07-02 19:52:46 My husband just showed me again why I love him so. Stopped on the side of the highway to help an elderly couple broke down. Drove 30 minutes to get them oil and got them on their way. Love my buttons!
1966 2018-07-02 19:52:39 “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows.” -Psalm 23:4-5
1967 2018-07-02 19:52:35 The governments both the National and County,should build the oil refinery to Lokichar in Turkana South to create job opportunity to the locals, to urbanise lokichar to a bigger town, to Avoid or reducing the billions of money used in importation @Locham_David @GovernorNanok
1968 2018-07-02 19:52:26 If anyone needs a job, the shop needs a part time tech to do oil changes, tire rotations, and other small jobs.

1976 2018-07-02 19:51:09 Thanks! I don't miss an episode! I'm one of those who pushes his "Big Oil" documentaries as far and wide as possible. Sometimes people don't understand the importance of them and I try to explain that he shows the key to EVERYTHING in those docs.
1977 2018-07-02 19:51:08 Trump supports taking American homes for foreign business profits.

He also supported taking American homes to ship Canadian oil to Saudi Refinery in Texas for refined oil to be shipped overseas.

This is just wrong.  period

1980 2018-07-02 19:50:20 “Most social democracies don't have ever increasing debt.” Are you excluding Europe, South America, and Africa and only looking at oil/mining countries when you make that claim? If not, can you provide a source?

1986 2018-07-02 19:49:52 We're wandering if the brakes are braking down there was some very fine steel bits in the oil so were doing them aswell !!!!!!
1987 2018-07-02 19:49:49 Whatever he says every single time he makes an insane prediction that doesn't come true, presumably. It's like the doomsday cult guy. When you're in that business, you just have to keep moving the goal posts and your true believers will keep buying the snake oil.
1988 2018-07-02 19:49:46 We had someone today ask if we give out an IMI certificate for our tinting course, after much chuckling I pointed out that wouldn’t he rather have a certificate off the worlds largest window tinting body, or the organisation that checks if you’ve changed your oil correctly

1992 2018-07-02 19:49:10 We had a case where this orange, foul smelling substance was coming out of someone’s pores. It was built up coconut oil in her skin. That stuff literally goes bad while sitting in your face.

1994 2018-07-02 19:49:04 #Iran can bath in oil for all we care -  #FreeIran or suffer the consequences of your actions-
1995 2018-07-02 19:48:57 It's also related to the current refugee crisis in the middle east. Our oil dependency made the region into a battle field for proxy wars. Western oil money propped up the Saudi regime which spreads radical islam. Western weapons go to the Saudi regime which leads war in Yemen.
1996 2018-07-02 19:48:54 I've been blushing dumb hard all day, having all these women come into the office and compliment my tan haha. That beard oil got me shinning extra hard too it's great.
1997 2018-07-02 19:48:43 I think I just ordered the worst smelling lavender essential oil in the world .... that’s what I get for trying a new brand

1999 2018-07-02 19:48:43 If we're cancelling socialism let's start with the subsidies for big oil, healthcare, and Wall Street. Then abolish ICE. Then maybe police. People should pay for their own law enforcement, am I right?
2000 2018-07-02 19:48:43 My 1st 2 Cards were 1988 Topps Big Canseco & McGwire..

2004 2018-07-02 19:47:55 If we are having a trade war with Canada does that mean @realDonaldTrump @POTUS will shut down the TransCanada 
Keystone XL Pipeline that so many US citizens do not want on their land.  Why be the pass through for them to sell oil elsewhere. It is our land/water at risk.
2005 2018-07-02 19:47:52 Do your scalp a favor and get some tea tree oil .... thank me later 
2006 2018-07-02 19:47:43 Caring for and housing the poor and homeless should be our priority not waiting for the next Trumpism. Economic and social justice is the path forward. No more Saudi oil or money supporting crooked politicians. End the endless Wars serve that serve the elite and no other.

Why not? Stores here have a dozen + to pick from.

2015 2018-07-02 19:46:35 Should have seen mine on Friday. Mixed leaves, peppers, red onion, olives, feta, chorizo and cherry tomatoes. Drizzled with a lightly spiced olive oil and served with crusty bread and a dry Welsh white. Superb it was.
2016 2018-07-02 19:46:25 I’ve also heard CBD oil helps a bit as well if not.

2029 2018-07-02 19:45:23 Maybe it’s made of oil? He could get that from fish and it works just as well. And oil burns. No but seriously, before every shot, Toothless inhales. And when he does that, he dries out his mouth. And that only works if he has a very small amount of water in his mouth.
2030 2018-07-02 19:44:52 Just baked it with a little marinade over top (Which had a bit of oil, garlic, salt, pepper, dijon, parsley & lemon juice)
Only took 14 in the oven :)
2031 2018-07-02 19:44:10 You pay the least amount of provincial taxes. The oil & gas industry pay higher federal taxes because its a high profits industry. They also get 3.4 billion a year in subsidies and the equalization formula is a Harper formula when you going to bitch & complain about that??
2032 2018-07-02 19:44:02 Agree! Real estate wave in India made a ton of land owners get into construction/property development. Always Wondered if there are other examples of these asset explosions. Oil ? Gold ?

2059 2018-07-02 19:40:45 It will devalue the currency further and if there is a push on oil prices inflation will go up at an accelerated rate. The risk exists.

2098 2018-07-02 19:35:25 I literally only use @MacariNaturals for my hair now just purchased the almond mint oil 
2099 2018-07-02 19:35:24 “Hi Giovanni! Not sure if you missed my last 4 emails trying to sell you a snake oil social media tool that tells you the same stats that Facebook gives you for free, but let me know when you’d like to schedule a call so I can absolutely waste the little time you have.”
2100 2018-07-02 19:35:18 So what happens when oil is back at $145 #HKGK
2101 2018-07-02 19:35:02 The BBC commentator just said "You can't set your oil fish down for a minute"

I don't know what that means but I'm gonna start using it.
2102 2018-07-02 19:34:58 yes, and Russian are working with the USA, and selling arms to Iran will gain from extra oil producing the regime never learn, to think Russian is on their side is foolish and naive.
2103 2018-07-02 19:34:56 Honestly sucks on it’s own. Try my mod - coffee, 2 tbsp butter (drop mct oil), 1 scoop gold standard double chocolate protein power. Sweeten with 1 packet sweet & low if needed. Ratio’s still keto friendly, helluva lot better tasting

2106 2018-07-02 19:34:50 Do oil refineries and plants count?
2107 2018-07-02 19:34:45 So, are you telling us that the #DAPL builders couldn’t run that oil pipeline “clean” for even a single year!  
 
Sometimes, the “We told you so!” of being correct doesn’t come close enough to satisfy the rage caused by the stupidity and injustice of others! 
2108 2018-07-02 19:34:45 I hate getting my oil changed cause these mfs always try talking to me the entire time

2110 2018-07-02 19:34:19 It’s crazy to me how central/Northern Europe isn’t familiar with the art of bread and olive oil. Wow what a sad little life
2111 2018-07-02 19:34:19 Shoutout to @SearsAuto for having the World Cup on while I get my oil changed

2113 2018-07-02 19:34:10 After I gave a homeless man a bottle of water he offered me some of his omega 3 fish oil pills… or at least that’s what bottle the pills were in.
2114 2018-07-02 19:33:53 So why do most people seem think that people in oil companies are part of an evil conspiracy to cause global warming? 
2115 2018-07-02 19:33:50 This girl just told me I spell like coconut  oil. Sis have good ass senses cause I been at work for 6 hours & she still smell it 
2116 2018-07-02 19:33:50 Got a new oil pen 
2117 2018-07-02 19:33:49 Thought I would at least have the pleasure of being mad at the ppl who changed my oil for my car breaking down today. Alas my car is just very old
2118 2018-07-02 19:33:39 Extra virgin olive oil really needs to get out more.
2119 2018-07-02 19:33:38 So, things like butter, coconut oil, avocado's, macadamia nuts, if you look at their nutritional value, they have mostly all fat. 1 avocado has about 21 g of fat, butter is all fat at 14 g fat per tablespoon. So, a normal lunch for me could be 2 or 3 eggs scrambled in butter,

I will be back after for another oil change plus the diff/transfer case service they recomended!
2126 2018-07-02 19:33:01 There's an interesting study about Melissa officinalis- if you take all of it, the oil and the flower, it is supposed to help with memory. They're using it as an aid for Alzheimer's patients & people with PTSD. Lemon balm. Imagine (^v^)
2127 2018-07-02 19:32:50 I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it
2128 2018-07-02 19:32:42 Heard some speculation. Does anyone know if it's true that Russia secretly promised #Trump that it would increase oil production by 1 million barrels? If so, what was the traded in return?
2129 2018-07-02 19:32:34 My aunt is using my wild growth oil to lotion her skin and I’m pissed

2131 2018-07-02 19:32:30 Donald, it’s not about oil production . . . .it’s about refining.
2132 2018-07-02 19:32:22 Oh, look. The fake Pres takes false pride in depending on Foriegn Oil. Next, he'll be bragging about buying crappy Tar sands.
2133 2018-07-02 19:32:19 I’m not being funny but why does one of my flat mates INSIST on using half a bottle of oil to cook his bacon in?????? walk into the kitchen and almost stack it there’s oil EVERYWHERE
2134 2018-07-02 19:32:18 imagine if the water table was that low ~ all we got was oil 4 water
2135 2018-07-02 19:32:12 @timspector @DrMichaelMosley
Many 'Plant Based' doctors think low rates of heart disease in meditareanean diet is IN SPITE of olive oil, not because of it. i.e. whole plant foods is the golden ticket.

Avocado and nuts healthier than olive oil (even Extra Virgin)...?
2136 2018-07-02 19:32:08 this is why i don’t take my car to get its oil changed....they always find something else that they wanna fix

2160 2018-07-02 19:29:12 Nah bro ...who dem be?
2161 2018-07-02 19:29:04 I thought putting oil on my body instead of body lotion was a good idea until I tried sitting like an asshole in the leather armchair and had my legs slipping around. Got me outchea like a greased chicken.
2162 2018-07-02 19:29:00 There's one good thing about paying a high price at the pump for Middle East gas: We're using up THEIR oil FIRST.  The US still have HUGE reserves.
2163 2018-07-02 19:28:48 Thank you! Yes it was messy. My coconut oil, which is usually solid at room temp looked like melted icecream lol. #creativebizhour
2164 2018-07-02 19:28:43 Oil change, kappa.
2165 2018-07-02 19:28:34 So I had my oil changed at the @Valvoline Express Care store in St Clairsville Ohio Saturday. When I pulled in, the worker called my vehicle a "rice burner." There's really no excuse for unsolicited racist comments like this.

2167 2018-07-02 19:28:21 Crunch the numbers: inc, inc tax, corp tax, sale tax, etc...the US comes out ahead 99% of the time in terms of standard of living.

2203 2018-07-02 19:22:43 The White House is walking back Trump's call for Saudi Arabia to "increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels" per day to make up for decreases in production by Iran and Venezuela. Trump claimed that he had spoken to Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz and that
2204 2018-07-02 19:22:35 Tried a slice of your chicken/bacon/red onion special at Harvard Sq yesterday.  It was definitely on the dry side.  It needed an olive oil base on the dough or ranch drizzle on top.
2205 2018-07-02 19:22:30 …and black angels went on flying through the failing light, angels with long hair, and hearts of olive oil.
2206 2018-07-02 19:22:19 It all depends on the market really. The oil industry has been run along cartel lines for many, many years. The infrastructure costs are huge. There’s small fluctuations but basically no one company rocks the boat & the customer pays through the nose :(
2207 2018-07-02 19:22:19 Also back in the Bush area you used to talk about all the Fema camps they were setting up to put people in. Now they are actually using those camps to house children and you are OK with it. Fake sellout conspiracy theorist snake oil selling idiot bait.

2211 2018-07-02 19:21:49 It's supposed to be a bit burnt. That's part of the flavour. But eggs will be very soft - white just barely cooked and yolk very runny. You can ladle hot oil over the egg to hasten cooking but then, a lot more oil will soak into the bread.

In 1973, replacing gold took < 6 mths & involved merely getting oil to rise 400% in < 6 mths.  It'll likely be quicker this time, but just as politically fraught.
2219 2018-07-02 19:20:55 Also, Norway‘s sovereign wealth fund built from oil revenues? Probably the finest example of Georgist principle that has ever been put in real life display.

2267 2018-07-02 19:15:31 We wish it was. But as long as Pruitt lets corporations - especially oil & gas companies -  do whatever they want, Trump isn't going to get rid of him.
2268 2018-07-02 19:15:22 You're going to have to explain this to me. You mean oil transactions - ALL of them - are paid in cash??? How is this even possible - there's not enough cash in the world to cover this, never mind the logistical nightmare . . .

2270 2018-07-02 19:14:46 Scandinavia is oft quoted by the Cult of Corbyn, but they are geographically different. Norway less population than London, economy oil, minerals, fish cf our financial and services. They have problems of unaffordable housing Oslo/Bergen. Higher sales taxes!
2271 2018-07-02 19:14:43 I will end up having to save up for another car  because my mother does not want to hear about my car that it leaks oil. Until it brakes down that' when it will come to her sense,she  will not go and get her car back it is already fixed.

2287 2018-07-02 19:12:52 Well, Norway aims to be "carbon neutral" by 2030, which is way ahead of the pack. But Statoil (recently renamed) will still be a big oil producer/exporter, filling the national pension fund with tax krone.
2288 2018-07-02 19:12:52 Lmaoooo. It's more like the needs of the many outweigh the luxuries of the few. The big scary government isn't gonna take your money, it's just reallocating it to places that actually help society instead of oil subsidies killing poor brown people.

2305 2018-07-02 19:10:50 I don’t think so, he’s playing games, playing a caricature of an MP from a time of empire, he’s an extremist & untested with ministerial responsibility as that carries the risk of failure , the thing with snake oil salesmen is eventually they’re found out
2306 2018-07-02 19:10:44 ん？何が起きた？

2359 2018-07-02 19:04:29 If we payed cash, then it had to be cash accounts that we stole from Iran. It was probably cash accounts linked to the former Shah regime involving oil transactions, which are all done in cash. But Iran is a sovereign state and can't have its assets seized forever.

2384 2018-07-02 19:01:36 Air New Zealand Adds Impossible Burger to In-Flight Menu. They lost me at “meatless burger.” The burger, which is made from plant proteins, coconut oil, and other things that are not beef, has been showing up everywhere lately, at independent restaurants and chains. #Nope
2385 2018-07-02 19:01:34 Local Moroccan joint serves dates drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt as an appetizer. I love chopped dates in smoothies too, but that gets expensive real quick.

2388 2018-07-02 19:01:29 The Trump administration it would not penalize reduced Iranian oil imports in at least some cases, a move that is likely to soothe market concerns.
2389 2018-07-02 19:01:05 You too should support offshore oil drilling. Cuba is doing it right off our southern coast. It also adds desperately needed diversity to Florida's economy.

2402 2018-07-02 18:59:47 Does your criticism of loan takers expand to a hate for subsidies? If true then you need to also attack the Billions of yearly subsidies give to the oil industry. This subsidy is then taken advantage of by the auto industry with low gas prices etc. Musk has said he prefers 0 subs
2403 2018-07-02 18:59:37 Bought an essential oil diffuser so it’s over for you bitches my life is finally put together

2407 2018-07-02 18:59:10 Twitter I bring you news! Barbecued frozen Brussels sprouts tossed in butter olive oil cumin and Chili are a TRIUMPH.

2409 2018-07-02 18:58:34 There's a reason why lemon grass essential oil is my favorite. It just reminds me of a time where I was truly happy because I have memories from when pll used to be on and when my dad lived with us, he would put it in a diffuser and it just makes me happy
2410 2018-07-02 18:58:28 Currently, market prefer continuation of NDA regime under Modi than a coalition government composed of regional parties.

Other headwinds to watch out in 2018

2. Global Trade War 
3. Fed tightening rates
4. Macroeconomic factors

2411 2018-07-02 18:58:19 why? as far as i know , the oil price will be stable by increasing of production from other vendors like saudi arabia
2412 2018-07-02 18:58:14 Selfcare is drinking lots of green tea, using your coconut oil and buying burn rubber  on iTunes am i right ladies
2413 2018-07-02 18:58:03 I was waiting for someone to point out the gargantuan amount of soybean/rapeseed oil in mayonnaise. No one should be consuming that garbage
2414 2018-07-02 18:58:02 If truly the foundations and laws of the United States were built on the Christian Faith, then Jesus Christ must be thought in all school in the United States of America. The childishness must stop. A plant which is not receiving water but oil will eventually die.

2421 2018-07-02 18:56:58 So I can tell you hate Democrats. That's sad. My father was a staunch Republican. Went to several GOP conventions and donated 10,000 plus every year! He would never of voted for Trump. Trump he said is a Snake Oil Salesman and NEVER to be trusted! So for you to blindly follow SAD
2422 2018-07-02 18:56:56 “Why is it easier to train oil drillers to be astronauts than it is to train astronauts to be oil drillers?” The answer to that burning question is worth the read.  
2423 2018-07-02 18:56:54 Castor oil is the worst
2424 2018-07-02 18:56:51 Some cruel elements like OBJ and other gang of Generals & political figures are doing everything  at their disposal to stop PMB.This all started After PMB's refusal to renew their oil Blocs licensed and the $16B saga. Their efforts will end up in futility in Sha Allah.
2425 2018-07-02 18:56:46 what about the canadian tar sand we pipe through our country. we get the mess and polution,then they ship it over seas for a better price! trump lied again,no benefit to U.S. just about greed from corporate america. big oil. trumps buddys.screw americans,america.fact!!!

2427 2018-07-02 18:56:26 Climate change = Peak oil (won't have oil by 2010 = Amazon rain forest (no forest by 1990)
2428 2018-07-02 18:56:22 Is oil not worth fighting for? What type of remark is that?
2429 2018-07-02 18:56:21 I was thinking of listening, but 2+ hours of lebron talk is bat shit crazy.  This doesn’t effect Detroit sports, which you know...is the point of the show.
I’d rather have @bigdrewCON give me a lap dance in just daisy duke shorts while covered in baby oil then get lebron talk
2430 2018-07-02 18:56:18 When she don't know how to cook and you force to try I guest you gonna need more oil to buy. By The time indomie noodles start swimming in oil

Thank you @TeamChevy
2435 2018-07-02 18:55:51 I saw the documentary awhile ago. It is a terrible idea to permit oil exploration where the last few Mountian gorillas live. #StopExtinction
2436 2018-07-02 18:55:37 The more expensive ones don’t work really!! Carrot oil is really good xxxx
2437 2018-07-02 18:55:37 The oddest thing I got rid of was the turn signal module, which doubles as a tip sensor (shuts off when the bike tips over) and optional security module. I also ditched the speed and oil pressure sensors, and the "debug port", which hardly debugs anything on a carbureted bike.
2438 2018-07-02 18:55:36 GRILL ME WITH OLIVE OIL YOU FILTHY LIAR

2445 2018-07-02 18:55:27 I couldn't give a monkeys. I welcome a world where no-one has mobile phones. Humanity wouldn't be worse off. People complain about oil drilling harming a wilderness and then jump in their car to drive less than a mile to buy a loaf of bread and complain about the price of fuel.

2449 2018-07-02 18:54:54 To increase oil barrel price to help out his buddy Putin?
2450 2018-07-02 18:54:32 Erm we also import 3 million barrels of oil a day

2451 2018-07-02 18:54:29 Nerlens is a great backup.. OKC ownership letting that oil money go
2452 2018-07-02 18:54:27 Everything in Ghana is just someway now

Who else have noticed that, the OIL inside the condom has reduced ...?

2453 2018-07-02 18:54:26 Respectfully, Is the depletion of the rainforests in Indonesia for the lucratice yet highly unnecessary palm oil industry and the displacement and threat-of-extinction of orangutans+ myriad other species yet considered an atrocity crime?  Thank You
2454 2018-07-02 18:54:05 Fold in six teaspoons of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
2455 2018-07-02 18:53:54 The only snake oil I'll ever shill is one that will leave your snake feeling shiny and moisturized
2456 2018-07-02 18:53:37 Milly too rock oil and flour.
Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in

2457 2018-07-02 18:53:25 @ItalianComments Grandfather always had a pot of pesto -- just basil, chopped pine nuts, olive oil, little parmesan cheese, & tiny bit garlic -- on the kitchen table.  Just a couple spoonfuls on a bread or any pasta and your all set. TV cooks use way too much garlic recipes

2461 2018-07-02 18:53:10 I heard they need to give us their oil?
2462 2018-07-02 18:53:10 will coconut oil help reduce the effect of a burn
2463 2018-07-02 18:53:07 I use Josie Maran argan oil on my face (the problem is that I often forget). It doesn't feel greasy after you apply it. Maybe @kiki_miserychic  has better  suggestions? She knows a lot more about beauty and skincare stuff than I do.
2464 2018-07-02 18:52:49 It worked out great for Kim, North Korea got free oil AND a nuclear reactor from the US.
2465 2018-07-02 18:52:44 Let's also give a hand to Tina Joemat Piettersson & Sibusiso Gumede who sold off R5 bil  of SA oil reserves for $28 per barrel to Glencore in exchange for them giving the keys to the Optimum Coal mine to the #Guptas

2468 2018-07-02 18:52:36 I forgot to add: 1 cup of italian dressing.  1/8 C tamari  1/8 C sesame oil and as much garlic as you like.  Cut in 1/2" slices, toss in marinade & let sit, tossing occasionally.  Brush with leftover marinade while grilling.  Enjoy!
2469 2018-07-02 18:52:31 It’s tanning oil Frank  it’s just called carrot oil xxxx
2470 2018-07-02 18:52:27 We lose 10% of the population and we probably can't build computers anymore. We're going to have a reset that lasts centuries at a minimum, coupled with the lack of resources that will be associated with not having oil for easy energy.
2471 2018-07-02 18:52:23 Lol no mention of albertan oil sands which is where most of the countrys money comes from
2472 2018-07-02 18:52:22 As long as it’s not the oil and gas industry, right?

2475 2018-07-02 18:52:14 Tenth circle of hell might be a Midas lobby where the World Cup is streaming on a large, loud TV but the sound and picture freeze and skip every 5-10 seconds and your oil change turns into a three-hour-long, you-also-need-new-brakes staycation extravaganza. 
2476 2018-07-02 18:52:04 Destin, Florida with elderly Aunt for Spring break  Me:college We  wanted a great tan to take home  Did the baby oil/iodine thing and laid out on an aluminum foil blanket we made. We were fried! We could not wear clothes and wore sheets off the bed x 3 days. PAIN! #SunburnRepeat
2477 2018-07-02 18:52:04 It’s really fun getting an oil change! Getting the judging looks and comments are a nice bonus. #FirstWorldProblems
2478 2018-07-02 18:51:59 I’m pretty sure silicon oil is less corrosive to hardware.
2479 2018-07-02 18:51:58 Yall, Willie left money in my dresser for me to go get my oil changed and tires rotated bc he knows I've been stressing to pay for my summer class. Ladies, sometimes it's not all about flowers and jewelry. 
2480 2018-07-02 18:51:57 we're building something for the future without using dirty oil money. We will be bigger than Man City ever will be and even the United fans will agree with that. Your level is Nottingham Forest and Villa, stick to it.
2481 2018-07-02 18:51:57 Wish to fk a new what the guy few gardens up is doing think he's drilling for oil by the sound of it 
2482 2018-07-02 18:51:57 Where did your mother get the olive oil from? The label is pretty but it's nondescript. So much olive oil!
2483 2018-07-02 18:51:56 Probably will take the same fall the Oil did last year after they were favourites

2496 2018-07-02 18:50:33 So brave. Put him on the front lines of the war on terror. Let's see if he rushes forward to shout at Al Qaeda, ISIS, Taliban, Boko Haram and confront them with a microphone.

2498 2018-07-02 18:50:25 Resp Sir,
Hats off for that idea. 
Yes we can see and find a solution for nature and the nearest part of the sky but what measures we are taking to nurture the underground resources as well as the hollows those we make while oil/gas exploration, a broom in hand is not Swatchata

2500 2018-07-02 18:50:10 We had to pass TWO different laws to get CBD oil. CBD OIL!! With 0.3mg or less of THC.
2501 2018-07-02 18:50:08 Change a light bulb and filled up your oil? The reason I drive a crap car.

2504 2018-07-02 18:49:47 I guess so; how does an economy diversify out of oil and gas. What would that look like. If what we are seeing is part of that what would be the big next steps?
2505 2018-07-02 18:49:32 finna put some oil in my kombucha

2507 2018-07-02 18:49:16 Simply impossible. That phone you're using to post that tweet? Guess how many components are composed of oil based products, rare earth minerals or gold, all of which came from mining...

2514 2018-07-02 18:48:51 Or one that moves by burning oil and mortgaging the planet’s future...
2515 2018-07-02 18:48:50 i want french fries but my niece is sleeping & my smoke detectors are so testy that if I start the oil, it’ll wake her UP THEN SHE WILL CRY NO THANK U
2516 2018-07-02 18:48:31 I haven’t looked at the details (unfunded liabilities and manipulation of interest rates) but countries w small populations sitting on oil/mining economies have an easier time. Though this didn’t save Venezuela, which is now going through the socialism to communism collapse.

2520 2018-07-02 18:48:05 Engine was making awful noises. It was a/c clutch. I also got inspected and oil change. Some is sales tax :/
2521 2018-07-02 18:48:04 Fracking came to 'market' via high oil and gas prices making it competitive.  It only found 'innovation' when oil and gas prices fell.....
2522 2018-07-02 18:47:56 Just went for an oil change at @jiffylube on 167ave and 50st. Great service as always! Oil fresh with a new air filter, truck is all reading for camping.

2526 2018-07-02 18:47:55 Let’s see: Mexico is, well Mexico. Nothing to fear & irrelevant other than Illegals, Drugs, Crime. Russia? Well, there’s a huge Army/Bavy/AirForce, Nukes & untold oil reserves. Oh, and maybe Amer can find a way to thwart election tampering & Bots...

2529 2018-07-02 18:47:31 I'm at Valvoline getting my oil changed and these guys gave me a water bottle. I don't care that this place is probably more expensive than others, their customer service is always exceptional.
2530 2018-07-02 18:47:31 football existed before 08 pal, we've won a lot more of those league titles than you, but you wouldn't know that as your club was born from oil in the middle east.
2531 2018-07-02 18:47:22 Shock as sections of MPs in @Parliament_Ug who passed the controversial #SocialMediaTax admit they lacked knowledge on the processes involved.

But this shouldn't shock many. A minister once said she didn't know what she was signing for in the Oil & gas agreement.

2535 2018-07-02 18:47:05 Lets give it 6 months and see if this move of closing oil ports has solved the distribution of wealth... i guess it will not.
2536 2018-07-02 18:47:04 Japan had a year of oil left. We were increasing sanctions even though we knew,  through code breaking, that it was like poking a stick in a bee hive.

2540 2018-07-02 18:46:13 Does this mean its canon that Tails drinks motor oil?
2541 2018-07-02 18:46:12 Gonna have to burst your bubble on Trudeau too. He’s not any better than Harper on oil sands, oil pipelines, and First Nations relations.
2542 2018-07-02 18:46:09 Yeah because one thing we know about Democrats, they'd love to make a welfare system off oil production...
2543 2018-07-02 18:46:08 i meanwhile we are at you aren’t suppose to flush toilet paper bc it’s still paper and will also clog ur pipes but that’s a different issue for a different day pls don’t pour oil down ur drains u dummies
2544 2018-07-02 18:46:07 Please pass on the information that Trump/Russian trolls are behind the "walkaway" hashtag & anyone using it & claiming to be left/dem/liberal or that they WERE #Dems but now they've seen the light are selling you snake oil
2545 2018-07-02 18:46:05 Walked into auto zone to pick up oil for my car and one of the guys goes “how can we help you today princess”  
First of all you can fuck off thanks

2549 2018-07-02 18:45:41 Muhammed bin Salman is his ally, as is the king Salman.  He has allowed SA to list their new company on the NYSE.  This was one thing we offered them in exchange for cleanining up the corruption.  In this way, we help them get off of oil so new energy tech can come. Behind scenes

2551 2018-07-02 18:45:22 A shoutout to christian for helping me change the oil in my car I probably would’ve cried in the post office parking lot for two hours if u weren’t there sorry everyone else this tweet isn’t funny they can’t all be winners
2552 2018-07-02 18:45:20 Cool I will bring hot dogs!!  Your sun sun block is oil based right???  They don't let me near fire after the "incident".

2554 2018-07-02 18:45:03 The shift can be subtle and even alluding partly due to the rise in plant-based junk food and lots of food adulterants. If one squeezes it out of a fruit or plant(sugar/oil), out of an animal(lard/butter), out of a grain(flour) or out of an ocean/mountain(salt), it’s not food.
2555 2018-07-02 18:45:03 Sorry, you are wrong. They are the most thoroughly tested of any pharmaceutical products stop listening to crackpots who are selling you snake oil.
2556 2018-07-02 18:44:44 Same with studies on exercise: are we looking at longevity, or cardio fitness, or diabetes risk? 

Or butter: did they study butter vs. olive oil, or butter vs. carbs? 

There are different kinds of studies, and they DON'T all boil down to good vs bad
2557 2018-07-02 18:44:26 Roasted ones with Chili and olive oil and butter really really did
2558 2018-07-02 18:44:16 She mainly cut back on the salt and oil. That’s all haha but Good luck though!
2559 2018-07-02 18:44:12 You know why he wants oil for Saudi Arabia?
2560 2018-07-02 18:44:11 Is that the same Norway that derives 25% of its GDP from oil and gas?
2561 2018-07-02 18:43:58 Cta and dating is liking mixing water and oil. Bad combination
2562 2018-07-02 18:43:54 Of course. He's heavily invested in big oil.

2568 2018-07-02 18:43:34 @PowerLunch Kilduff says Trump right about opec fixing prices lol NOT true, Saudi came to realize produced too much, now less and price higher and smarter. Besides USA runs out of Oil in 10 years per EIA...

2575 2018-07-02 18:43:06 If Saudi Arabia increases supply of oil in response to Trump's request, it will hurt Iran's economy and by extension Toman will be expected to depreciate even more.
2576 2018-07-02 18:43:00 @cnbc commodity desk, you did an awful, inaccurate explanation about Trump's Saudi oil tweet, which was a lie, that WH backed off & SA did not verify the contents. SA has to stay withing OPEC guidelines so cannot raise oil by 2 million barrels. @JohnJHarwood  need truth here pls
2577 2018-07-02 18:42:49 every summer some refinery somewhere is shutdown and supplies dwindle, I think they do this so they can justify the artificially high prices.  Oil is 1/2 what it cost 5 years ago but gas prices are about the same … makes no sense to me.

2581 2018-07-02 18:42:09 NO! Do not keep the focus on Trump. Look at social justice. Look at economic justice. Look at single-payer healthcare. Look at all energy sources other than oil. Look at anything but Trump. Please. Storm the Bastille!

2594 2018-07-02 18:41:12 @ddailyreport  Whatever happened to our oil pipeline network? What happened to other petroleum depots in Nigeria? #ddailyreport
2595 2018-07-02 18:40:52 US is playing dirty tricks again.Blocking Iran &forcing other nations stop oil imports will cripple Iran.Does our strong PM agree to dictates of Trump.Let us watch what India will do ?. Meekly surrender or go with own policy disregarding Trump.A big problem to India.
2596 2018-07-02 18:40:46 True, but technology also improves over time. We've seen this already in the oil sands + fracking industries (otherwise it wouldn't even be profitable for them). This is also happening w/ solar + EV's which are roughly 40% more efficient than a decade ago (don't quote me on that)
2597 2018-07-02 18:40:37 Can someone recommend an essential oil that helps with stabbing pain of not having $1mil in my bank account

2599 2018-07-02 18:40:29 Gotcha. Well then id definitely look into the fat bomb and bullet proof coffee route. If you can eat meat, look for a higher fat content meat, maybe put some more oil, butter, or cheese in your food. It'll add up.

2610 2018-07-02 18:39:32 FDA requires "mayonnaise" contain a minimum of 65% vegetable oil, and though Kraft keeps Miracle Whip’s oil content a secret, it confirms it is too low to meet the mayo standard.
2611 2018-07-02 18:39:30 So when are we going to see the first nuclear vendor partnership with a major oil&gas company for a synthetic fuel production pilot plant?

This breakthrough will see 'Big Oil' join with nuclear to start to become part of the climate solution not remaining part of the problem.

Along with vegetable oil, vegetable shortening and most mayos.  Gotta check the labels.
2622 2018-07-02 18:38:27 What triggered the fall of Venezuela?  Chavez introducing Socialism and the nationalizing the oil industry! They destroyed it!
2623 2018-07-02 18:38:20 I have bad reactions to candles as well...and REALLY bad reactions to those stupid oil diffuser things.
2624 2018-07-02 18:37:47 So we sanction Venezuela and Iran on oil. War mongers in the US use us as pawns for their greed
2625 2018-07-02 18:37:40 I think we have a couple in the UK, for the oil rigs. Possible to use them?

2632 2018-07-02 18:37:05 Just call Dennis Gartman and tell him to go bullish on oil , problem solved
2633 2018-07-02 18:36:38 That was in 08/09 when oil went to $150....and everyone was trying to go 'off grid', lol.  I even go quotes on solar and found that my roof pitch (like 50%) of other homes ran N/S vs E/W and wasn't suitable for solar (not to mention the $60k pricetag!)
2634 2018-07-02 18:36:17 Hi Jayne. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.

2637 2018-07-02 18:35:53 Cleaning oil by simply. Cleaning oils are great for makeup remover and don’t irritate my skin afterwards. Target has a decent selection! I like the Rose one by shea moisture but it can irritate the eyes
2638 2018-07-02 18:35:43 I worked for CNRL for a long time. When their Horizon project was in pre-embryonic stage there was talk of building a nuclear reactor to supply all oil sands with power for oil development. In hind sight it would have been worth the hassle. Nobody fortold the opposition to come.
2639 2018-07-02 18:35:40 It’s all about the oil isn’t it. 
Trump and the Saudis are doing a massive deal with the us oil companies.

2641 2018-07-02 18:35:30 Um, almost every one of these quotes was directed at private industry for stuff like, oh, spilling oil or fleecing employee benefits. The punch one wasn’t even Obama but Jim Messina. How about a little fact checking before spreading BS.

2654 2018-07-02 18:33:11 It's even more insane that people actually believe his bullshit. The man is a snake oil salesman who preys on the weak minded simpletons who want to believe there's a reason their lives are complete shit.

2656 2018-07-02 18:32:28 If anyone else suffers from psoriasis, I highly recommend the Avon Skin So Soft bath oil. It really helps with the itchiness! Be careful though because it makes the tub VERY slippery!

2658 2018-07-02 18:32:22 Yo these fucking people at the tire place are really bitching about a spider on the car like if you don’t cut out all this bullshit and change my oil I’m liable to snap

2660 2018-07-02 18:32:11 Even with rising oil prices, Maduro has dug the country into such a pit it has no hope in recovering. From jailing his political opponents, monopolizing everything under the government, to printing so much money that every citizen is now a millionaire that can’t buy anything.

2679 2018-07-02 18:30:00 Did the same in Iraq. Saddam dared to sell oil for euros. IDK if WWIII. If collapse comes swiftly not much can be done. But this threat to petro $ I'd bet is behind all this Russiagate. Russia enemy no. 1 or competitor no. 1. I go with competitor. Syria also dumped petro$.
2680 2018-07-02 18:30:00 The #economy of #Iraq has focused too heavily on #oil production and exportation. Attempts are being made to diversify the economy by developing the production of #dates.

The oil also contains some vitamins and mineral

How much is the middle class paying for the 1.5 trillion in borrowed money for his 1% #taxscam

Okay lmao I’m out
2706 2018-07-02 18:27:47 I really can't recommend it. The slight benefits of flax oil in some people comes from the Omega 3 and Omega 9 content, the high Omega 6 makes it a rather poor choice. Better to go with Turmeric or curcumin, Fish Oil and refraining from grain and sugar.
2707 2018-07-02 18:27:37 . No no no. We in africa now must pay more for fuel oil gas.

2716 2018-07-02 18:27:03 I would like to see what a draft articulation of what modern war aims would look like.  Bringing democracy to a tyrannized population?  Like we did in Iraq?  To capture their oil fields?  When markets are just now coming to terms with an historic glut?
2717 2018-07-02 18:27:01 I got a new perfume, that has a amazing smell to it and after putting in on, I realize it's oil base. Clothes and oil base anything do not mix well. Now it's on one of my favorite shirts. 
2718 2018-07-02 18:26:45 Maybe its beacause it is a silly question. Everyone want a fairer system... but there is no absolute model that works/deliveres absolute fairness. The closing of oil is not about distributing wealth but about changing head of CBL. Method of Distributing wealth is a gment decision

2723 2018-07-02 18:26:30 Why not speak to American oil producers and talk them into increasing production?  We need to be independent of Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia cuts off people's heads for things we don't.  It is an evil empire.

The other is driven by our esteemed bureaucrats via taxes. Max - you're an egalitarian, no? If so, suck up the higher fuel price.

2743 2018-07-02 18:24:45 Must burn you up that nobody cares about those Fords.  Ford has had 100 years to innovate a better solution than burning oil. It represents the past. Fact is that Tesla has a mission beyond filling executive bank accounts and it shows.

2757 2018-07-02 18:22:57 I'm trying to find it online on my old blog, but I can't seem to remember the blog url...basically I think it was 1.5 cups semolina flour, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons water, mix and let rest for at least 5 hours (I usually do it over night)

2790 2018-07-02 18:18:40 CL Time Spread story is clearly telling us it's "Game On" for a summer physical oil shortage in Cushing. UV (which was lagging considerably) now overtaking QU is probably even bigger news that both trading >2.20. This problem ain't going away soon, folks. #OOTT
2791 2018-07-02 18:18:39 so just veg oil, not like peanut or something
2792 2018-07-02 18:18:27 So all the stories of gang recruiting, forced participation through threats and violence are just urban legends? Supposed to be reason for migration, but they only do it there and not here?
2793 2018-07-02 18:18:15 Sliced very thin and sautéed for a short time in very light oil. Sprinkle of salt and pepper. Excellent.
2794 2018-07-02 18:18:07 Dang, a little oil and hair mousse will get you far
2795 2018-07-02 18:18:04 Paul Fouracre: 

By late 8th c. Frankish rulers associated themselves with the burning of light. One factor to keep light a resource for elites, was scarcity of olive oil. Shortage of it turned to advantage of elites. They could fulfill obligations that others couldn't.

2800 2018-07-02 18:17:30 Hair will still grow even without your oil. And not washing one's hair regularly produces a natural oily shine to the hair.
I am not in favour of hairy skin, but I suppose some people might.

Just do whatever and make sure I don’t break down. Ugh I feel like such a loser this is why I need to be married.
2817 2018-07-02 18:16:16 Demon King or Baby Oil?

2819 2018-07-02 18:16:03 From what I hear 128g is more of a max limit than a mandatory daily goal. But if you still struggle with not enough fat, fat bombs, mct oil, or bulletproof coffee are easy additions to get more fat in your eating window.
2820 2018-07-02 18:16:02 Oil spills are never fully cleaned either. Permanent ecological damage that is entirely avoidable. #sustainability #solar
2821 2018-07-02 18:16:00 Might want to hook a generator up to a treadmill as well.  Maybe corner the market on oil lamps as well.

2826 2018-07-02 18:15:38 Yeah do whatever works for you! Little variables like what kind of oil you use matter less than what you're cooking in it.

(Also log the tbsp of oil you use when you cook )

2841 2018-07-02 18:13:38 I think 'mook' is actually an antiquated term used largely by the Jewish community. But I couldn't resist! Probably doesn't fit the time period, nor the tone, but sometimes I indulge regardless. The snake oil salesman bit is of a bygone era...like me.

2847 2018-07-02 18:13:24 Lazaro Cardenas was basically Mexican FDR, he nationalized oil and all mines and giving free land to peasant farmers, the US was trying to overthrow him when WW2 broke out and had to ask him for help patrolling the oceans while the US Navi was trolling the Germans

2883 2018-07-02 18:09:25 You would think after being hoodwinked by such a bold snake oil salesmen, like Owebama, the looney Libs would not be so eager to buy Marxist snake oil again so quickly! Oh well, we will just have to smash them over the head with free market capitalism and wealth creation for all!
2884 2018-07-02 18:09:24 Oil is a commodity, Gold is a currency. Majority of physical Gold traded in Shanghai, Oil price determined by the global cartels of OPEC and NOPEC.
2885 2018-07-02 18:09:00 Incidentally Kenya is also pinning its hope in oil exploration. A commodity whose peak demand is estimated is expected to be between 2030-3040
2886 2018-07-02 18:08:49 I think Ryan Borucki led the oil change team at Valvoline during my last visit. Today, he's striking out Tigers hither and yon. (This may not be a true story, but I would have bought it at first blush)

2894 2018-07-02 18:08:16 Are you upset at #bitcoin? Think crypto is manipulated garbage and only whales make money? Then have a look at gold, crude oil or stocks charts. Crypto is extremely directional. Both up and down. Relatively easy. Traditional markets are the exact opposite.

2901 2018-07-02 18:07:39 Haha stopped short of the hyper cool ‘L’ gesture ! I’ve had a fine day but just realised I managed to get my friends bike oil all over my legs somehow! There is an element of loserishness to my current state as it happens #itwillenduponmyface #clumisnessesess

3 days ago he said he called Saudi Arabia and asked them to raise oil production. He was told yes they would. LIE

2915 2018-07-02 18:06:02 Too faced royal oil. Undefeated.
2916 2018-07-02 18:06:01 I am actually kinda amazed how my skin looks better now than it did years ago. Using coconut oil, organic honey, and brown sugar on my face, never using sunscreen, eating fruit and spicy foods, and getting actual sleep has worked wonders.
2917 2018-07-02 18:05:55 Yea, I straight up eat eggs for brekky everyday. Just add some salt, cracked black pepper and a little garlic powder if you like garlic. DONE! You got a delish omelette. Cook it in olive oil!!

2920 2018-07-02 18:05:36 Mix together1 cup of olive oil, two cloves of garlic, three teaspoons of salt and one of paprika. 
Rub generously all over and sit in the sun for nine hours.

2930 2018-07-02 18:04:43 That is in addition to the full amount of oil revenue that has been spent in Scotland for all 24 or the last 30 years.
2931 2018-07-02 18:04:40 I just breathed next to this guy in the military and he asked if he could illegally invade foreign countries in order to access oil. What do I do??

2935 2018-07-02 18:04:15 It should also be noted that a man can be anointed from above, even without pouring oil on him,
2936 2018-07-02 18:04:09 It’s not just about the butter, the fat in the butter binds with MCTs for better digestion.  Full fat coconut milk or oil has fat and MCTs (MCT oil is extracted and refined from coconut oil) so it’s essentially the same thing
2937 2018-07-02 18:04:01 In most cases oil is involve physically, but is just a symbol of a substance, It is the Holy Spirit of God that will descend into the man that makes the difference.
2938 2018-07-02 18:03:55 Is this a way to keep the oil flowing?

This really is a miracle cure. I had a skin cancer festering on my nose for 4 yrs. It got to be the size of a dime. It would bleed & scab over.. A month ago I started taking CBD oil and now that cancerous spot healed.

2947 2018-07-02 18:02:42 That's what oil does, ignores everything til it cant. If the market priced in the supply and growth concerns as needed, the market could have avoided a 70% collapse in '14/'15.

Then, the failure of the regime will be left for the future generations to deal with, just like Brexit.

3003 2018-07-02 17:56:45 When the whole of your economy relies on oil and the that bottoms you end up fooked. Nothing to do with socialism. Socialism there had brought poverty down from 50% to 20% and was continuing to do so. It was the reduction in poverty that Corbyn praised.

Her tactics were the same as Trumps and you keep saying she wasn't responsible for her actions because she wasn't as good at it as Trump.

3015 2018-07-02 17:55:18 What do you use? I tried natural deodorant with arrowroot powder and coconut oil before. It would melt in the summertime (in AZ) and all my shirts ended up with stains from the oils.

3023 2018-07-02 17:54:31 This is terrible! There are thousands of ecologically less sensitive places that oil can be obtained. Example Alberta, Canada, but no. Obviously it's just about profits and nothing else. Poor Mountain Gorilla.

3028 2018-07-02 17:54:16 The problem is the base assumption that men and women are not merely "equal," in all ways, but also indistinguishable. When women's mortality rate on the job equals men's, perhaps we can talk about makeup. See also war, police, oil roughnecks, etc. You may want to stick to looks.

3037 2018-07-02 17:53:17 This is ridiculous. If government spending created a surplus or multiplied money, we wouldn't have any debt at all. 
We could become richer by just spending more.
3038 2018-07-02 17:53:15 So paper grocery bags are bad for trees, plastic bags depend on oil, and an individual cotton bag would need to be used >7K times in order to outway the environmental impact it’s made to produce it…

Wtf do we do then? Get groceries TELEPORTED into our kitchens?
3039 2018-07-02 17:53:12 Canada spends ~ $2.2 billion / year on Saudi oil, which doesn’t have to meet the same environmental standards as Canadian oil.

Yet “green” groups blocked #EnergyEast and continue to ignore all other oil suppliers. 

There’s nothing green about that.

3047 2018-07-02 17:52:34 yep. combine this with switching the $3.3B in oil and gas subsidies to an electric vehicle program and we'd be well on our way...
3048 2018-07-02 17:52:30 Foreign investment in a country isn’t inherently exploitation. China invests in the US. It creates economic growth. The problem became the bad ideals of communism infecting South America intentionally by USSR along with the rise of dictators during the oil crisis
3049 2018-07-02 17:52:24 Yes I’m so ready for this, could’ve died the other day and today because my truck had oil and gas leaking into the engine and it could have blew up had I been driving it any longer

3056 2018-07-02 17:51:57 According to the @Reuters survey, Venezuela's oil production declined by 20 kbd in June to 1.43 mbd. Other sources like Platts have reported lower levels.

3058 2018-07-02 17:51:32 oil too

3063 2018-07-02 17:51:05 They're invested alright, look at the alternative. Buy the oil, by all means, it's worth nothing if you don't have a buyer, but as I said, he's on video making bold statements. He wasn't running for office then, but it's come back to bite him in the arse I think.

3076 2018-07-02 17:49:34 Part of the reason for butter/ghee is because the fat binds with the medium chain triglycerides from the MCT oil and aids digestion. But I agree that it’s actually quite delicious, I don’t drink coffee without it anymore

3084 2018-07-02 17:49:04 It is amazing how many things have soy in them. Have to really be diligent to avoid soy, soy lecithin and soybean oil, it’s in everything.

3088 2018-07-02 17:48:44 Why does an oil change take an hour??
3089 2018-07-02 17:48:41 By investing in oil companies that do fracking!

3095 2018-07-02 17:48:27 Risky game if they rely on that. One big rise in oil prices and that 50% youth unemployment in Southern Europe quickly becomes 60%, etc...

I never knew until I got to my 30's how much of a status symbol a purse is.

That's info older brothers don't pass on to us as we go through the rites of passage of changing oil and fixing faucets.

Why is @GovernmentZA not sourcing crude oil from Angola or Nigeria?
3103 2018-07-02 17:47:42 Yeah, but restaurants cook their food in it a lot of times, sadly. If it was as simple as “don’t order tofu” then my life would be super easy, but they cook so so much with it when they could simply use olive oil that you get soy in food you would never expect to.
3104 2018-07-02 17:47:30 As I understand it, Navarro has been spewing his economic nonsense for years, and up until now, nobody took him seriously.

Then along came Donald Trump looking for a snake oil salesman to tell the deplorables that you can turn coal into gold.
3105 2018-07-02 17:47:19 Can't be done in Puerto Rico, beside POTUS deregulation policies, P.R. Goverment has severe local taxes (i.e. capital and property tax, oil and gasoline tax per liter, etc)... not to mention the oil cartel that already reside in P.R. that wants no competition!!

3113 2018-07-02 17:46:40 I cant eat a lot of it because i think im either sensitive to italian dressing or the amount of oil because after awhile my mouth goes numb
3114 2018-07-02 17:46:39 If we “buy” the oil it benefits US and the people of Iran, so what.  We can agree to disagree and see what happens.  Something, for sure, is brewing.  The People of Iran R invested!
3115 2018-07-02 17:46:24 My grandma got it me and she used hers all the time, it’s amazing! Best way to make chips/roast potatoes that are also fat free because you can use that low calorie cooking spray instead of oil to coat the potatoes
3116 2018-07-02 17:46:18 anyone else play that game where you put off getting your oil changed so long you honestly wonder when your car will explode?
3117 2018-07-02 17:46:17 We do not hold any other technology to that standard. How much mercury & radioactives end up in the ocean from burning coal? How much leakage from ocean transport of oil? Those risks are apparently acceptable and have greater frequency & consequences than radiological releases.

3124 2018-07-02 17:45:23 Castor oil is worse 
3125 2018-07-02 17:45:21 Over 50 demographic has never been this confident in the economy, because they've been drawn into a messianic faith in trump. That's another reason sentiment is worse in silver now,than in 2015. Its also cheaper now,because main mining cost (oil) was about 2X as high back then
3126 2018-07-02 17:45:11 Turkish State was not buying oil. What you did have was local businessmen with gas stations buying it oil & cutting it with properly refined oil (thereby increasing profit margins). Truckers would come to buy it as well. Where Turkey failed, was not securing border prior to 2015.
3127 2018-07-02 17:45:09 As far as I am concerned America has no oil. I just don’t get why we are buying it from them, it’s killing us, Ramaphosa is aiding USA bully us.

3131 2018-07-02 17:44:32 Good article about oil Baron status quo propaganda from the dinosaur ages of technology, and trying to discredit EV technology which will knock them off their longtime gluttonous pedestal, but Electrification shouldn't be the end-all on innovation as a sidetrack, either.
3132 2018-07-02 17:44:29 The foolish virgins were not prepared to meet the Lord (Matthew 25:11-12, 41-46)

The foolish virgins are the goats and not the sheep (Matthew 25:32-33, John 10:26). The sheep, born of God, are prepared as the wise virgins were, with both a lamp and oil (Matthew 25:9–10, 33-40)

3137 2018-07-02 17:43:59 You do know that if Westminster hadn't botched/cheated Scotlands oil we would be 1 of the richest nations...hence why successive governments slapped the secrets act on the McCrone report, to stop you/me knowing!

3146 2018-07-02 17:43:10 Problem with dt being involved with the middle east is, he's always said he'd take the oil. They've got sod all else of value. Isis etc uses a montage of video clips as a recruitment tool of him saying it. So, dt has to be very careful not to get drawn into a fight. V difficult.
3147 2018-07-02 17:42:57 Would somebody inform someone that we should save our oil and coal for when we actually need it?

3166 2018-07-02 17:41:04 If the tape isn't enough, and the paint is really dry, a light pass with a nylon scrubby pad, like a Scotch-bright, will take care of most embedded crud, just oil out or retouch varnish to reunify the surface.
3167 2018-07-02 17:41:03 I don't think it's addictive. I think it's more of people having a personality that makes them develope addictive tendencies.

3181 2018-07-02 17:40:10 Trump's tweet about talking to Saudi to increase oil production? Its crap they said a week earlier they were going to increase. Why is important? IRAN cant sell the oil they produce. Making the prices go up. Take the $10 and buy some $5 dollar gas with it. Know the whole story.

3196 2018-07-02 17:38:20 Usually I don’t preach to other people, but CBD oil could be that miracle cure you’re looking for. I would recommend a tincture. Ask people about it and you’ll see for yourself.
3197 2018-07-02 17:38:17 wish I could RT this. setting powder, setting spray, and oil blotting sheets do wonders!!!!
3198 2018-07-02 17:38:11 @VinnieTortorich every morning I blend 20oz of coffee with 1tbsp each  of coconut oil, butter & cream and scoop BCAA powder. Your thoughts?
3199 2018-07-02 17:38:11 Could be. I wish Bush had just ordered that no Venezuelan oil would be allowed in us ports so we has avoided the humanitarian crisis those animals created down there.
3200 2018-07-02 17:38:10 Centrists strive to pass Purity Tests, all the time!
Of course those tests are from Pharma, Wall Street, and big oil.
YOU though, cannot have a purity test!
3201 2018-07-02 17:38:09 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

3204 2018-07-02 17:37:16 Not only crude oil prices, cost of refineries also matter... in places like TN, useless protests are leading to closure of industries which also complicate matters... crude oil prices alone doesn’t matter...
3205 2018-07-02 17:37:11 Nigeria wasn’t a failed state before the discovery of oil (1956). 

Most oil rich Nations fared very well after the discovery of oil and also diversified their economy with different streams of revenue. 

Nigeria is Nigeria’s problem. Greed

3220 2018-07-02 17:36:02 @JUULvapor why can I not get to talk to anyone. I have two Juuls that do not work and a pack of the oil that was all leaking out.  Not happy with your product
3221 2018-07-02 17:35:47 Thanks in part to @michellemalkin I decided to give CBD oil a try in the hopes it might help with my chronic insomnia caused by RLS (restless leg syndrome) and my lady parts giving out (menopause...ugh). Happy to report I’ve already seen improvement with zero side effects #Hemp
3222 2018-07-02 17:35:29 It looks so amazing to look at. It's inspiring what someone can do with sand, oil and acrylic. Many obnoxious classic art-centered critics will think it's easy and plain boring, but knowing what's behind the artwork is important and often nobody thought of doing it before.
3223 2018-07-02 17:35:28 I don't know where my tanning oil went so I used Pam cooking spray.
3224 2018-07-02 17:35:14 Feel like crude oil is starting a 1 or 2 month blow-off that goes to 90-100.  Spreads saying something is up short term  and it ain't bearish! US production capped out short term, US exports overcommitted?? and geopolitical risk of less imports.

3231 2018-07-02 17:34:35 Also Quebec gets their oil from Venezuela! Sad. Oil is used in so many products that other energy sources could not replace. Oil isn’t going away global anytime soon. Canadian regulation are very strong. No reason we can’t do many sources of energy. Our economy is resource baised
3232 2018-07-02 17:34:34 Why Yuan devaluation only affected gold/silver prices and not oil? All these are trade in yuan's future market?
3233 2018-07-02 17:34:32 Notley’s criteria it seems, EXCLUDED skills to appoint ministers.

Take for instance, the finance minister, Joe Ceci. A SOCIAL WORKER with no finance background?

3253 2018-07-02 17:31:31 For decades Saudi have played pivotal role in stability of the oil market in cooperation with our allies 

What's new?
3254 2018-07-02 17:31:27 There's also a solid argument to be made that US-friendly oil producing regimes boosted their production levels to depress oil prices in order to exert pressure of Venezuelan economy that, combined with sanctions, precipitated their present crisis.

PDVSA is pretty anti-Chavista.
3255 2018-07-02 17:31:27 Is it possible to get an oil change without the service guys coming up with a list of other stuff you need to change/replace? 
3256 2018-07-02 17:31:21 Well if the ME had any sense, they would just cut the oil off to Denmark.

3265 2018-07-02 17:30:38 Poor hot starting, if not fuel list is : valve ( esp exhaust) clearances, coil, condenser, worn engine causing oil mist in the intake. If plugs not oily, then rule out worn motor. Coils often cause mysterious faults and are susceptible to heat-related failure

3345 2018-07-02 17:22:33 A person with no oil in their lamp (Matthew 25:3) will eventually lose the Word (Matthew 25:8, Mark 4:3-7) instead of keep it and produce Spiritual fruit (Luke 8:15). 

The Oil symbolizes the anointing of the Holy Spirit (1 John 2:20) and the Lamp the Word of God (Psalm 119:105).
3346 2018-07-02 17:22:28 The case of seventy years how much the profit in it. and the beneficiaries look at it same oil well.
3347 2018-07-02 17:22:23 Start taking cannabis oil it really helps my sister takes 10 drops a day. We are all with you.
3348 2018-07-02 17:22:19 The prices are too high because you made Iran noncompetitive in the oil market by closing them off from the US economy. It's your fault, not due to turmoil in Iran and Venezuela
3349 2018-07-02 17:22:12 Oil dal do jaldi
3350 2018-07-02 17:21:56 ส่วนใหญ่ที่ออยตันนี่ไม่ใช่ไม่วางพล็อตนะคะ แต่ไมรู้จะบรรยายยังไงให้ไปถึงตรงนั้นมากกว่าค่ะ 5555555555555/ เดี๋ยวนี้คำผิดใหม่ๆมากเยอะมากเลยนะคะ  แระ ไช่ ร้องให้ สเน่ห์ อะไรงี้ เห็นแล้วแบบ ฮืออ เอามาจากไหนน
3351 2018-07-02 17:21:56 Or that the sparsely populated interior states would align themselves with a snake oil salesman we urban dwellers knew was a con man from day one.
3352 2018-07-02 17:21:47 Kenaikan dollar menguntungkan export? Kita export crude oil Dan import fuel.. resultantenya negatif...
3353 2018-07-02 17:21:45 Yup gotta keep those tax $$$ coming in from these workers so you can let tax cheats keep $ billions off shore, give $ billions of subsidies to profitable oil and gas and overpay for a leaky pipeline!  #stopthekmbuyout #cdnpoli #bcpoli

3356 2018-07-02 17:21:22 The owner ( my cousin) actually works with anything you ask. Gluten free, oil free, they will do their best to comply and usually meet demands with outstanding results!!  thanknyou fir sharing and for the support. It really is appreciated 
3357 2018-07-02 17:21:18 ได้ดิ ยินดีเลย
3358 2018-07-02 17:21:14 Hey @TraderJoesList, why would TJ put sugar and wheat in its frozen quinoa and vegetable medley.  Why soybean oil in the sugar-free mayo?
3359 2018-07-02 17:21:07 I wish ppl would stop using coconut oil lol that shit is not good
3360 2018-07-02 17:21:05 Retweeted Bill Gates’ Maiguard (@knightofdelta):

You take a look at our budget numbers and a bulk of our revenues will be funded by oil proceeds, and then borrowing. Chai. 

So we are borrowing to service debt and switching our debt model from the Japanese to the Greek.
3361 2018-07-02 17:21:03 Ganó el odio.
3362 2018-07-02 17:20:41 Waiting for my car to get the oil changed. I’m suddenly starving. Excuse me stomach. We just ate before coming here.
3363 2018-07-02 17:20:39 Chia is a disaster at the negotiating table. MacT was as well, and so was Lowe back in his day. If Chiarelli was a master negotiator, he could offset some of his trade losses with efficient use of cap space. Being bad at big trades & contract negotiations/cap mgmt is disastrous
3364 2018-07-02 17:20:24 Seems like a good psa to me!
3365 2018-07-02 17:20:19 favku virgin coconut oil sama makarizo
3366 2018-07-02 17:20:15 Looks like the 'hot' part is sorted :-/
Aloe or lavender essential oil should help.....
3367 2018-07-02 17:20:08 LOLNDBFBFFJF

To be fair I wear citrus essential oil like everyday so I supposedly smell like oranges myself but I really doubt hinata goes to that much effort
3368 2018-07-02 17:20:06 Lds flushing fluid and pump oil is way better than the Robinson stuff. It's pretty inexpensive to compared to some stuff.
3369 2018-07-02 17:20:04 เสื้อยืด ~64 นิ้ว ค่ะ ฮู้ด ~70 นิ้ว
3370 2018-07-02 17:19:57 Didn’t know castor oil smells like this velekenna  @aestheticnur
3371 2018-07-02 17:19:45 And coconut oil #rip #gloop
3372 2018-07-02 17:19:41 I typically apply the oil/salt/pepper while it is still chilled and then allow it to soak all that in/create a crust while it gets to room temp.

Hope this stands true for One Plus 5 users as well! Really frustrating to see a good camera become this way cos of an update! @OnePlus_Support
3374 2018-07-02 17:19:17 Aloe and coconut oil
3375 2018-07-02 17:19:15 Ill never forget explaining the term selling them snake oil to my old boss. Pretty sure she still doesn't get it.
3376 2018-07-02 17:19:09 This is the stupidest tweet of the year.  #water #oil #timber #ironore #nickel #naturalgas ......
3377 2018-07-02 17:19:08 So pissed off with #rt22nissan because I took my brand new car in for an oil change and to have them look at the tire as there was a nail and they stripped the bolts and can’t get new ones in until Friday. Like wtf...are you kidding me. #nissan #rt22 #hillsidenj
3378 2018-07-02 17:19:08 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
3379 2018-07-02 17:18:57 อกเท่าไหร่คะ 5xl
3380 2018-07-02 17:18:55 Spill it girl !! Realist Mindsets / Twisted Libtard Mindsets = Oil to Water !!! Thing is Libs still standing end with trump.. they use him as their release valve to vent their miserable lives !!! they need to be rounded up & airdropped in iran at this point
3381 2018-07-02 17:18:49 I hate when people try to downplay eating fruit bc it’s “too much sugar” If you’re not eating your vegetables raw, don’t talk to me. You’re cooking all the nutrients out of your vegetables and covering them in oil/butter and salt. Your argument is invalid. 
3382 2018-07-02 17:18:48 มโนว่าเป็นตัวเองไม่ไหวจริงๆค่ะ ถ้ามโนเป็นหมอยังว่าไปอย่างนะคะ 555555555555555 บางคนเขาคงเมนใครแล้วอยากให้คู่กับตัวเองล่ะมั้งคะ ไม่เหมือนเราที่เมนแล้วอยากโยนให้คนอื่นย่ำยี ฟฟฟฟฟฟฟฟฟฟฟ เรืโนอาห์ก็ดีค่ะ อย่าเป็นเรือไททานิคก็พอนะคะ 55555
3383 2018-07-02 17:18:46 Please impeach 45 & hide the peach tanning oil when it's done
3384 2018-07-02 17:18:41 Coconut oil is really over rated
3385 2018-07-02 17:18:13 First state suit in the country against oil companies — “here we are, the smallest state, the Ocean State, taking on Big Oil.” #ActOnClimate
3386 2018-07-02 17:18:12 Big business big pharma big oil are the ones running shit. They just change puppets face methinks
3387 2018-07-02 17:18:11 I love spending my time oil pulling.
3388 2018-07-02 17:18:02 get yourself an air fry, use ready made sauces and spices. literally the healthiest and easiest way to learn cooking, and eat healthy without a drop of oil. 
ive taught both my brothers to cook on it. you come home, put the chicken in, shower and come back and its ready
3389 2018-07-02 17:17:53 That's one of the interesting aspects of Chia. The Kassian trade was good. Giving a player with his history a multiyear deal was stupid.  Kassian should be on one year deals for the rest of his career.
3390 2018-07-02 17:17:48 I made chickpea + carrot salad w/ red wine vinegar, salt, pep, cumin, olive oil, shallot
3391 2018-07-02 17:17:35 起きたぞージョジョー！！（なお寝られたとはry
3392 2018-07-02 17:17:33 no, just a refill with rōbinson high vac pump oil. i need to do a big amzn order soon, though, so possibly worth a try..

it actually doesn't seem as bad in here as i thought it might be, but a flushing oil might save me a lot of annoying work
3393 2018-07-02 17:17:33 It has olive oil on
3394 2018-07-02 17:17:27 Omg. I know the feeling. I used aloe to get rid of my star crunch & it was perfect! Now i just exfoliate with coconut oil.
3395 2018-07-02 17:17:09 Oil change places want you to get everything but an oil change 
3396 2018-07-02 17:17:02 exhausted.. drained..narcolepsy still not getting proper treatment cause the medicine isn't strong enough or working... literally fighting to not fall asleep cause I soon gotta go get my daughter from her camp then get an oil change done. Bleh this well is going to be tough
3397 2018-07-02 17:16:59 Went to try and get my oil changed and the fuckin hood wouldn’t open. Most inconvenient shit ever dawg
3398 2018-07-02 17:16:47 Had to get troops on the ground to get to that oil and oil money
3399 2018-07-02 17:16:47 Is there anything better than a good Szechuan chili oil? It's like crack.
3400 2018-07-02 17:16:42 This will lower oil output from Iran but does not necessarily reduces income as the price will go up everywhere; all world pays for Trump adventures over oil market and tariffs:/
3401 2018-07-02 17:16:41 اذا انت مامتضرر أشكر ربك وأكرمنا بسكوتك
3402 2018-07-02 17:16:39 Me on queer eye:

Bobby: A frank ocean poster?
Antoni: Ice cream isn’t a meal
Tan: Just because you’re going to different places with different people doesn’t mean you should repeat outfits
Karamo: How are you a writer if you don’t write?
Jonathan: You put olive oil on your face?
3403 2018-07-02 17:16:32 I wouldn’t be so sure.  Mexico is far less vulnerable to oil price fluctuations.  Whether the new leader will be able to pay for his policies by reducing corruption remains to be seen...
3404 2018-07-02 17:16:29 Good news - my allergies are fine
Bad news - frigging chest infection. A stress related chest infection.
Ah well.... The steroids might counteract the calming effect of the CDB oil haha  
3405 2018-07-02 17:16:20 คงเพราะสกิลพระเอกที่จะมีคนรุมล้อมเยอะๆละมั้งคะ คนเลยชิปกันเยอะ ชอบตอนเขายันมากค่ะ มีความทั้งเอส หรือเอ็มก็ได้นะคะ ฟฟฟฟฟฟฟฟ/นี่ก็ไม่ได้ตามเท่าไหร่ค่ะ ส่วนใหญ่จะอ่านเอานะคะ แต่พอต้องรอนานๆก็เลยหนีไปติ่งเรื่องอื่นก่อน ว่าจะค่อยมาอ่านรวดเดียวเอาค่ะ แต่ตอนนียังไม่ได้อ่านเลย 55555
3406 2018-07-02 17:16:20 My coconut oil has melted in my house haha
3407 2018-07-02 17:16:19 WTI oil at $73.87/barrel, -$0.29.
3408 2018-07-02 17:16:18 Coconut oil for the win
3409 2018-07-02 17:16:15 I've been at Walmart for 3 hours waiting for them to change my oil and rotate my tires.  If I knew it was going to take this long, I would have done it myself.  
3410 2018-07-02 17:16:13 Confident Selig Allan H buys 1,000 of Oil Dri Corp Of America shares. Largest in 7 months. #insiderbuying #stocktrot
3411 2018-07-02 17:16:06 This tactic taken by MKT. Oil Company- IOC, BPCL, HPCL. Those coy are looting Bengal and propagating Hindi. Best strong Bengali agitation before their Regional Office in KOLKATA to stop Hindi nuisance in Bengal. No sign board in their Office, outlet Bengali language nowhere.
3412 2018-07-02 17:16:01 The oil can only flow if you pour it out.  #StevenFurtick

3415 2018-07-02 17:15:53 What would create a lot of #AmericanJobs? #Solar4All (every home) - you could call it "Defense Spending" instead - because, it will make US more energy independent, less likely to war for oil, cleaner, more saving/spending money for people, lasts a lifetime, win win win
3416 2018-07-02 17:15:52 Keep in mind Algeria is an important oil producer. No one will bother them.
3417 2018-07-02 17:15:51 I only coat the meat with a rubbing of olive oil. I use primarily a little salt and a bit more pepper. Finishing with butter makes it good.
3418 2018-07-02 17:15:39 Lol its not yaz and it's cheaper..but oil iyaphela you'll have to keep refilling but iba cheap. Google,bought mine ewoolworths

3421 2018-07-02 17:15:32 Clearly I know that a car doesn’t have feelings but I feel like my car is so happy when I get an oil change 
3422 2018-07-02 17:15:32 Even if theres absolutely no food in the crib, there's always pasta, nooch, and olive oil
3423 2018-07-02 17:15:23 Coconut oil sex is underrated 
3424 2018-07-02 17:15:20 i’ve been putting this oil change off & i jusy need to get it done!!!
3425 2018-07-02 17:15:19 Turkey needed ISIS oil? LOL. Very bad attempt to revitalize turkish crimes. If you put local actors and warlords in the same category as a NATO member and EU candidate then Im surprised you are anti erdogan.
3426 2018-07-02 17:15:18 Trying not to separate
3427 2018-07-02 17:15:16 TIP:
Write a quick note of thanks for something your spouse did recently, whether it was changing the oil, running an errand, or really listening to you when you had a tough day. Hide it somewhere so they'll discover it during their day and know their efforts are appreciated.
3428 2018-07-02 17:14:59 Ambition to elevate
3429 2018-07-02 17:14:36 Hope they get ya oil out the store and not the sewer

3437 2018-07-02 17:13:45 I have an enquiry asking how to remove an oil stain from a drive way ?
3438 2018-07-02 17:13:38 ... ...intense and absorbing...like the slow flowing beauty of an oil slick on water......love the moody soundscape... 
3439 2018-07-02 17:13:32 Yeah it's really surprising srzly
3440 2018-07-02 17:13:21 *courage*
3441 2018-07-02 17:12:57 I don't care about ponytails and stuff, but American women don't even try.

Their hair is all fried out and unbrushed. They don't know how to do a single hairstyle. Like a bun or a braid or something. 

These Middle Eastern women brush and oil their hair and have beautiful hair.
3442 2018-07-02 17:12:50 When oil was in the $50s and Trump left Saudi on his 1st state visit, he claimed he wanted oil even lower and then went on to sell SPR over the years. Trump has no love for oil like Bush did, but the rest is should be out of his hands. His energy policies have been A+ nonetheless
3443 2018-07-02 17:12:49 Very impressed with the @Weberbarbecues griddle..... first cook I think I used little to much oil.... infact shouldn’t have used any I think

3447 2018-07-02 17:12:09 2 parts coconut oil, 1 part baking soda, 10-20 drops of peppermint essential oil.. voila, toothpaste!
3448 2018-07-02 17:12:06 Try making a sepia symbolist work with sesame oil!
3449 2018-07-02 17:12:05 We should have made Mexico our 51st state and it would have solved a ton of border problems ASAP.  We would gain lot's of OIL and great vacation places and good eats as well.  Also, our new southern border would be very tiny compared to what we have today.

3454 2018-07-02 17:11:18 me: essential oils are for dumb sucKeRs
also me: my summer cold gave me an earache and DayQuil didn't work so i flooded my ear with the finest selection of jojoba, coconut, peppermint, lavender and basil oil. holistic health is a lifestyle.
3455 2018-07-02 17:11:12 There’s a reason why I avoid certain places to get my car inspected, or get my oil change at, cause some folks are just crazy!

3464 2018-07-02 17:10:32 so far:
* drained the sludge
* opened the oil case
* wiped down everything visible, haven't opened the rotary vane stack up yet
* reassembled, filled with clean oil

that covers the bulk of the gross contamination and when i do the next flush I'm going into the rotors
3465 2018-07-02 17:10:26 おにーさんにまかせとけー！

3472 2018-07-02 17:09:46 Jacob Zuma's son is dead.  Who said that black magic dont work? Ramaposa if he don't play right, hurt hearts of nation will cast spells if things gets more expensive because of oil.  Don't underestimate our blackness.   It still reigns. Because it was never lost to Jesus.

3474 2018-07-02 17:09:33 Shaved my legs with coconut oil this morn. Currently sliding on my chair like a greased pig at a redneck BBQ
3475 2018-07-02 17:09:28 Oil change complete 
3476 2018-07-02 17:09:15 I Hate The Fact That I Have Oil Skin 
3477 2018-07-02 17:09:14 Not everyone wants to risk their life for offense contractors and the oil lobby.
3478 2018-07-02 17:08:59 I can imagine how difficult it has to be to work with sand. Not the most pleasant thing in the universe tbh. Especially with oil and acrylic.

3480 2018-07-02 17:08:55 How’s the water quality in that system? Is this oil base this still developing?

3486 2018-07-02 17:08:07 Zinke just posted Yosemite photo praising its creation! Future generations will remember (and curse) Zinke as they look at photos of oil wells, coal mines, & cows grazing on public lands. That will be his "legacy."

3496 2018-07-02 17:07:26 a while ago i bought this hair coconut oil from the Indian store and smell reminded me of lolo Tonga which i wasnt a huge fan of but i had my had my hair feeling silky & soft even after washing it . I ended up giving it to one of the sisters & she loved it...
3497 2018-07-02 17:07:19 Good! Stay in the upcoming glorious socialist nation of Mexico, we’ll all want to be there soon, right? Go get a jumpstart into government run slavery!
3498 2018-07-02 17:07:18 For those that don't know, Globalist money comes from Hebrew Biafra, where the British govt continues their GENOCIDE to steal oil and gas. Recognize Hebrew Biafra and globalist FUNDS dry's up.
3499 2018-07-02 17:07:17 nz has made sure to stop using all gasoline, stop importing products delivered using oil tankers, abandoned air travel...

nz imports almost all its energy, so hard to know where its voltage came from. relabeling coal/oil to biofuel/hydro/geothermal is easy. it pays well too.
3500 2018-07-02 17:07:17 I love you Islamists, but the consciousness of that one is the same one of crude oil. Its toxic and leads to burning and death. In the true creator's set-apart language, the name you're worshiping means "burnt offering" and is used in Genesis 22:2. Listen to Yeshua for salvation.

3506 2018-07-02 17:07:09 Could he subsidize US oil industry so that WE produce more oil instead of the Saudis?  We already produce more than them, why not more?  That would allow us to continue expanding imports, while also lowering prices...win/win

3540 2018-07-02 17:02:56 Anyway back to more important matters South Africa needs to stop buying Oil from Saudi Arabia. Our relationship with Saudi is toxic and built on their arrogance and our fear of being energy insecure.
3541 2018-07-02 17:02:50 #HealthTip: Keep in mind that Extra Virgin Olive Oil cannot be used in high heat #cooking, but use it liberally in medium/low heat cooking and #baking, to dip whole grain bread in, and to drizzle on cooked foods or salads!
3542 2018-07-02 17:02:41 What are they going to fund? More roads into parks so big oil and mining cos have an easier time getting to their strip mines? Or, worse yet, funding cleanup after their destruction?

3595 2018-07-02 16:57:15 Funny thing is, the "resouce curse" proves that Venezuela was not a truly socialist country, as it was still vulnerable to international market changes. So when the oil price collapsed in that period, so too did the economy lose a lot of value.

The reason why it's so much more -

3629 2018-07-02 16:54:00 $XLE continues to lag spot oil prices ST.  Seems like XLE hitting ST resistance at 75.  1 year chart showing larger and larger divergence.  5 year chart would suggest the opposite FWIW -- that oil is finally catching up.  Difficult to get very excited about either here.
3630 2018-07-02 16:53:54 Kids wore perfume in middle school? I know my home-schooled farm kid is showing, but I'm pretty sure scents my sisters were sporting at 11 were incidental --horse sweat, hay, neatsfoot oil...

...and I still don't wear cologne. Wait is that why everyone wrinkles their nose at me?

3638 2018-07-02 16:52:57 Julie, WTF are you talking about.  Canada has virtually kicked the Oil and Gas industry out of this country, at least $250 Billion in investments gone. A conservative government would have upheld the law and made construction possible.  Once those $ leave, they rarely come back.

3643 2018-07-02 16:52:34 Remember the Canadian oil pipeline.  Perhaps if we turn this off and stop buying the dirty oil from the Canadian Oil Sands then all of these tariffs aginst is go away.  Who is gonna buy the Canadian Oil and process.  Sure they have other customers but who is gonna feel the pinch
3644 2018-07-02 16:52:29 And yet the true believers of either ideological camp really really believe that their leader is the "one". So odd.

3671 2018-07-02 16:49:11 Yes, I agree, the socio-economic impacts are not well understood enough. I think it's often not clear if palm oil is actually economically "good" for a country. There are also issues of slave labor, child labor etc.

However, most Cdns have no issues importing oil from nations with truly terrible human rights records. Illogical.

3745 2018-07-02 16:43:13 Chavez's vision for Venezuela didn't fail because he was a Socialist. He relied too heavily on one industry, the oil industry. When oil prices went down, so did the revenue sustaining his social programmes. Poor economic planning, not ideology, is what put Venezuela where it is.

3758 2018-07-02 16:42:06 Very nice 
3759 2018-07-02 16:42:06 i have to go to the dmv and get my license renewed and call the car dealership about an oil change and idk why i’m anxious about it sigh
3760 2018-07-02 16:42:04 Ontario will leave the leading edge of green technology & climate action to join the ranks of climate change deniers owned by oil & corp. Our grandchildren will suffer bc of who you elected as leader. You had smart choices in PC, you chose this mini cheeto.

3763 2018-07-02 16:41:48 We can all look forward to seeing just how the oil industry will respond to all this phasing-out of their products #bbcpm
3764 2018-07-02 16:41:47 Hahaha me neither! No oil LOL
3765 2018-07-02 16:41:38 Remember: There was another Obrador POMex, who nationalised oil industry
3766 2018-07-02 16:41:30 Much cheaper because the DoD is the single biggest oil consumer in the world and the US is the biggest producer followed by KSA and Russia.
3767 2018-07-02 16:41:28 , drink Alkaline water & use CBD oil. Cancer cannot live in alkaline environment.
3768 2018-07-02 16:41:22 I LOVE my Luna fofo face washer. Look it up, it’s super nice. Also don’t use foaming face washes, only cleansers, and wash your face twice. Once to get rid of dirt and oil, second to actually get the nutrients into your pores!
3769 2018-07-02 16:41:21 Pake baby oil atau minyak zaitun

3773 2018-07-02 16:40:34 Oil drives the rest of the country. How much economic growth is spured by the educational, health and government systems. Zero. There a product of renewable energy.
3774 2018-07-02 16:40:33 Also bought a foot cream containing my 2 fave things: avocado oil and urea
3775 2018-07-02 16:40:19 Is more like it the other way around, US wants Venezuela Oil can't get what they want so they then feel the need to bring ''Freedom to Venezuela''

3783 2018-07-02 16:40:01 The US military is NOT a "black hole" - every dollar that goes into it is an investment in security & freedom. Consider the price of oil without security provided by the US DoD.

3785 2018-07-02 16:39:56 @realDonaldTrump quote: If Donald Trump is smart he will release 100 million barrels of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves on the market ASAP and drive the oil speculators out of the market, causing oil and gas prices to plummet, and thereby stimulating the economy all over again
3786 2018-07-02 16:39:56 I bet there was no mention of clean renewable energy that BP loves to advertise they are focusing on.  Oil has caused so much damage, death and destruction to our country.  Greedy, greedy, greedy fools.
3787 2018-07-02 16:39:54 My favorite recipe is Rava Appam with lots of veggies, tomato,onion, carrot, cabbage,corn and just chopped all these and mix with Rava and yogurt and add pinch of salt and little oil and put it in Appam tray and put it for 5 minute on gas and healthy Appam is ready #ContestAlert

3791 2018-07-02 16:39:31 Over the weekend, Trump claimed he had gotten the Saudis to agree to increase oil production by 2 million barrels per day.

HE WAS LYING, AS USUAL.

Both the White House and the Saudis have already contradicted Trump's statement.

3801 2018-07-02 16:38:11 Me too
3802 2018-07-02 16:37:56 Ha Ha! I've given up listening to Trump. so I missed that. He perhaps doesn't understand that jobs in the US oil patch depend on prices that return a profit for the higher cost US producers... Facts would only confuse him and his followers.
3803 2018-07-02 16:37:51 B判定で絶望なのマジでどんな世界の話なの
3804 2018-07-02 16:37:42 I don’t even wanna check my online banking after yesterday lol. I paid for brunch, I brought hella gifts and still had to turn around and get gas and an oil change lol
3805 2018-07-02 16:37:27 Did you bring Habibi oil with you
3806 2018-07-02 16:37:08 Leftist populist AMLO won Mexico's election on Sunday but the country's oil production won't get hit too hard through 2025 because he's unlikely to get two-thirds of Congress to reverse energy reform, which is woven into constitution, S&P Global Platts says

3810 2018-07-02 16:36:33 "Coconut oil? It smell awful"

It's not!! It just make me hungry because my head now smells like coconut biscuit.

Now I want to snack!
3811 2018-07-02 16:36:33 Some facts! American and eu policies to make crimea part of ukriane again are failing! No hint of Russian withdrawal from Crimea. Germany making big oil deals with Russia while there’s is some Syria coordination. So why not talk about this at G8?
3812 2018-07-02 16:36:28 But how do you pay this? Taxes? Tarifs? Nationalizing the oil industry as is the rule in latinamerica?
3813 2018-07-02 16:36:24 Oh crap, just heard we’re having a Civil War that I can’t attend. I’m getting my hair cut that day and an oil change. @kathygriffin do you happen to know where we are supposed to RSVP? Alex Jones proved he’s an idiot once again.
3814 2018-07-02 16:36:21 I hope they apply for the stat medical card that will allow them to purchase the marijuana oil. ing that everything works out for the good of the family!
3815 2018-07-02 16:36:05 Not really as he fought against a dictator who was killing his ppl and fought for a dream of a better future . It’s what came after that’s sad. The ppl were played & divided against each other for the benefit of power greedy men and of course oil.
3816 2018-07-02 16:35:56 Truth and Trump are like oil and water. They just don't mix.
3817 2018-07-02 16:35:36 I'm with on this one. Like the kid and agree that he may be able to make it as a depth guy at the NHL level.

3819 2018-07-02 16:35:28 Guess I'm gonna have to oil up the old flintlock if we're going to have a civil war and storm the Capitol. Oh, and does anyone know where I can get some mini-balls...except from @RealAlexJones
3820 2018-07-02 16:35:27 A Socialist UK would work entirely differently as we aren't reliant on oil exports and have a much sturdier less corrupt economy. Socialism isn't the bad guy, corruption is. It ruins Socialist states to undermine them and often to take advantage from within
3821 2018-07-02 16:35:27 @CNBC , why can’t we increase our own oil output instead of asking someone else?
3822 2018-07-02 16:35:24 That moment when you get distracted and you cook the bottom of your favorite enameled cast iron pot.... Lemon essential oil for the win!!!

3824 2018-07-02 16:35:20 I never thought I would be rid of the condition which I think was caused by extreme stress.  Eucalyptus citriodora first, + sea salt & Avocado oil cleared them completely.  Chilli has capsaicin in which is used in creams, and can help psoriasis, bites, eczema. glandular swellings
3825 2018-07-02 16:35:05 “ICO Advisor” and “Blockchain Strategist” are the modern day equivalents of snake oil salesmen.  

Go build something meaningful in this space. Then advise or “strategize” based on those experiences.
3826 2018-07-02 16:34:54 Snake oil. It’s harmful and it doesn’t work.
3827 2018-07-02 16:34:37 Every damn time I know the jalapeños on my pizza are gonna hurt when they reach my intestines and the oil starts burning but damn if I don’t keep putting jalapeños on my pizza

3829 2018-07-02 16:34:29 Why do this ,Tories looking after the environment..isn't there anywhere else they can fucking drill for oil.
3830 2018-07-02 16:34:12 Don't you think it's time we built more oil refineries and factories to process our raw materials? Instead of relying on the rest of the world for finished products.
3831 2018-07-02 16:34:07 In the end, everyone leaves Cleveland. #Lebron -- Think what a powerhouse city Cleveland would be if they didn't chase John Rockefeller and Standard Oil out of it with their petty and chronic taxes? Cleveland could be Chicago.
3832 2018-07-02 16:34:03 Venezuela was among richest counties in world and now among worst managed.  They had oil, which can bring prosperity but wrong Govt policies and socialism brought so much damage.

I was doing the breakfast shift and I was putting hash browns in the oil to cook and a girl was putting apple pies in at the same time she dropped a pie and the oil splashed me and I had a massive burn all over my arm and hand still have scars
3836 2018-07-02 16:33:46 If the island of Jamaica should find oil of a significant amount that will last for a long time, certain THIEVING folks and their immediate families would need to be banished from Jamaica or knocked off for the good of our beloved Jamaica!
3837 2018-07-02 16:33:41 Hello Martin, thank you for your question. I can confirm that the Skin Soothe Shave Gel does not contain Jojoba Beads, only the Jojoba Oil. I hope this helps!
3838 2018-07-02 16:33:29 The amount of oil exuding from my skin right now is fucking illegal
3839 2018-07-02 16:33:12 We have started the switch! 
Solar and wind power operations are popping up around Alberta and the NDP have a plan to phase out oil. 
The other parties want to come back and make us oil dependant because they can't regulate the sun and wind.

3842 2018-07-02 16:33:01 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
3843 2018-07-02 16:33:00 Pre-congrats on $100 oil
3844 2018-07-02 16:32:58 No like Venezuela. Venezuela has long had a problem with corruption way before it became Socialist. People were actually better off when it first became Socialist though. Before the US imposed sanctions and Saudi Arabia mysteriously decided to overproduced oil driving price down

3849 2018-07-02 16:32:37 A1 pt 2: Since #coconutoil typically contains about 2/3 Medium Chain Triglycerides naturally, it could be beneficial. However, there is far more evidence for the benefits of Extra Virgin Olive Oil than coconut oil at this time. #NorthShoreAlzChat
3850 2018-07-02 16:32:27 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3851 2018-07-02 16:32:26 Agree that would be the challenge for him. But I see plenty of room for "We have plenty of demand and need to PUT AMERICA FIRST and keep our oil for our own use!". Totally at odds with his other policies, but I think he could "sell" that message.

3854 2018-07-02 16:32:07 A1 pt 1: While there isn’t any solid evidence from clinical trials for potential benefits of coconut oil in #Alzheimer’s, there is limited promising evidence for Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil use in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

Investment in obsolete technology. Surely there must be some oil under Utah!
3873 2018-07-02 16:29:56 The way I like to "value" it is to calculate the theoretical annualized return for arbing the spread in either direction. In this case the hypothetical guy who owns physical oil in cushing could "rent it out for 3 months" for about $5 (3-mo backwardation). Huge annualized return.
3874 2018-07-02 16:29:49 Oil change donate plasma and going to freehold

3880 2018-07-02 16:29:11 Why N. Korea wont de-nuclearize ?
Simple,  President Clinton made the same agreement with N. Korea.
We would supply N. Korea with cheaper North Shore oil.
A few years later, President George W. Bush reneged on that agreement.

3964 2018-07-02 16:21:00 The total essential oil yield of plants is generally quite low; it rarely exceeds one percent. For instance, it takes about 22 pounds (9.9 kg) of rose petals to make just 0.16 oz (5 ml) of rose essential oil. Resulting in higher prices for some oils. #midnightalchemy

4044 2018-07-02 16:13:28 Oil free cleanser. Witch hazel toner. Hyaluronic acid serum. And good light moisturizer. You can use an oil to like jojoba oil instead as well.
4045 2018-07-02 16:13:19 The pipeline is the safest and most efficient way to transport oil. We should focus on reducing our dependency on oil, not argue about how it will be transported.

4047 2018-07-02 16:12:53 And while the oil shock hurt economies everywhere, the particularly severe problems in Britain were mostly the fault of Anthony Barber's frankly Olympian incompetence.

4056 2018-07-02 16:11:36 NAFTA was screwed from the start with Trudeau's demand for policies included that had no business being in a free trade agreement.  Look at the countries that feed oil to our east coast refineries - Trudeau cares not about their human rights abuses.
4057 2018-07-02 16:11:36 Follow the money. Stop oil states funding war. My guess cheaper than war. France not doing that well in Mali.
4058 2018-07-02 16:11:36 Aeropress is good!  I love how you get that lovely little film of oil from the beans.

4060 2018-07-02 16:11:30 Well for me, I have super oily skin so I can’t go near anything that’s not oil free because I’m also acne prone. I can’t risk clogging up my pores bc that will lead to breakouts. So if you have really oily skin, I say go oil free. Also try to get a good toner and develop aroutine

4065 2018-07-02 16:11:23 It's not hair oil,
Mentioned as edibles Cold Press Coconut Oil because of govt. Rules. 

It's truly finest edible oil/ghee on planet earth.

It's makes food delicious and Sugar, BP will stay miles away. 

We surely reverse all types of heart+brain diseases, even we fight Cancer.
4066 2018-07-02 16:11:18 1/ TRUMP/CRUDE EXPORT THOUGHT EXERCISE (THREAD): This weekend's events taught us two things: 1) Pres. Trump has plenty of personal energy to focus on lowering oil prices, and 2) His understanding of all the intricacies involved is weak, as evidenced by his misinformed tweet Sat.
4067 2018-07-02 16:11:10 They need to raise taxes on the cartels and rebuild their oil & gas industry!  They have almost no middle class.  About 1% wealthy and 97% poor!
4068 2018-07-02 16:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: crispy crust with spicy motor oil and shrimp.
4069 2018-07-02 16:11:07 Aku pakai tea tree oil, tak sampai berapa minit pakai, rumet pun balik.

   Bau oil ni mmg memenuhi ruang, sampai pening kepala dia terhidu bau ni.
4070 2018-07-02 16:11:05 The cream rises to the top. Do you know what else rises the top? A slick of crude oil. Carbon monoxide. Don't assume that because you're on top you deserve to be there.
4071 2018-07-02 16:11:02 Nothing to do with fear, it's experience. And your critique of the Tories is just proving my point I'm afraid. I'm of an age when starry eyed Utopias offered by devious snake oil salesmen like McDonnell can be smelled at fifty paces.

4075 2018-07-02 16:10:24 Yeah I was saying that the other day, almost everyone in the Pacific division made moves & big time moves to fix holes in their lineup & the #Oilers are just going into next hoping guys bounce back with it adding any real help. Oil have a tough schedule to start the season too...
4076 2018-07-02 16:10:14 Luck & prayers, are like oil & water, they just don’t mix! When you have God you have all you need. Favor is when God acts on your behalf (deserved & unmerited), luck is when things happen to go well. I emphatically declare, there are no coincidences in God!

4087 2018-07-02 16:09:00 Welp happily listened to another episode of "Late Night with the Oil Knight" on my way home from Niagara Falls. To be called a "ghost" is a privelage. Great show as always gents!

4088 2018-07-02 16:08:58 Jim moved to lay down on his stomach. He got comfortable and closed his eyes. He said nothing and focused on the scent of the essential oil.
4089 2018-07-02 16:08:47 He doesn’t watch them but listens. He cracks up over PopLuxe (@OfficialNadi) every time and the way you say oil .
4090 2018-07-02 16:08:40 @realDonaldTrump Select countries or Iran's oil, or the US financial markets can only choose one. The terrorist regime of Iran will soon be on its knees
4091 2018-07-02 16:08:39 Guess we will find out. I am short oil. Let's see where oil is trading come Nov.
4092 2018-07-02 16:08:37 Mexico has been a basket case for 30 plus years. This pipe piper can't screw it up. We in the US hold their future in our wallets. If we reduce the flow of necessary cash to Mexico China my step in to make money on Mexico's ore, oil and food. Maybe also their ports.
4093 2018-07-02 16:08:31 The United States seeks to reduce Iran’s oil revenue to zero when it re-imposes sanctions on the country’s energy sector on November 4 - State Dept. Policy Adviser
4094 2018-07-02 16:08:24 #A12 remains closed southbound due to a vehicle fire between the #B1007 and the #A414 #Margaretting #Chelmsford #HoweGreen. The HGV on fire was carrying hay and a large oil spillage has also been reported. Road expected to stay closed for some time.
4095 2018-07-02 16:08:14 Well...Harley-Davidson is moving to Thailand, and the price of oil is skyrocketing on the world markets....with the GOP/Trump Trickle Down 3.0.
Who could not have predicted that...?
4096 2018-07-02 16:08:10 how many free cups of coffee can I drink in the time it takes to get my oil changed
4097 2018-07-02 16:08:09 @realDonaldTrump The Treasury must close all roads to bring the dollar to Iran, I hope all accounts of the Iranian regime will be blocked. I emphasize that by November all Iranian oil will be cut off 100% and there is no exemption.
4098 2018-07-02 16:08:06 I think I'll have the orange flavored massage oil on Flower tonight, chicken would go with that so chicken cacciatore on white rice a summer salad and sweet baguette. Ooo a delicate white wine and raspberry cheesecake. Reverse engineering.

4102 2018-07-02 16:07:32 The dimsters who buy your snake oil are arming themselves. Way to go dickweed.
4103 2018-07-02 16:07:30 And maybe some snake oil, too? 
4104 2018-07-02 16:07:28 เหมือนเสร่อ ทวิตให้คนด่าเล่นนนน โรคจิตอ่อนๆๆ เอ๊ะ!? หรือหนักกก??!
4105 2018-07-02 16:07:21 @WinBig888 anyone betting on oil vs clean energy is deluded.  New energy arrives to destroy old energy completely.  Maxim still true.
4106 2018-07-02 16:07:06 In fact, much of my diet was plant-based. I didn't eat much meat, mostly tofu based products, fish and chicken (no skin). My added fats were monounsaturated (olive oil) and at that point I cooked in canola. I not only developed T2D, but extreme HTN and dyslipemia.
4107 2018-07-02 16:07:02 Liam, it's great news your out there pressing the flesh, discussing future FTAs, but what is not acceptable is a half/half that's been reported in leaving the eu. Nor snake skin oil salesman Olly Robbins, electorate voted to #TakeBackControl now ensure its delivered!!
4108 2018-07-02 16:06:59 See thats the thing. Ive been told to get oil free ones, and also told to use oil based ones, to counteract the dryness. So whats the best way?
4109 2018-07-02 16:06:56 That shit's for the birds. Make your own cold brew and add vanilla bean powder+full fat coconut milk(or oil)+cinnamon. BP coffee is just a marketing gimmick that tastes like . Save the butter for eggs or steak.

4114 2018-07-02 16:06:17 I wouldn't worry too much. He seems like someone whose head is in the right place -- calling for increased scholarships for youth and expanding social welfare for seniors -- and Venezuela's problems are not due to socialism. Rather it's due to dictatorship, mismanagement of oil.

How do you even eat that much oil and fat in one setting is beyond me.
4119 2018-07-02 16:05:37 Currently sitting in a room waiting for an oil change while going through all my Harry vids
4120 2018-07-02 16:05:37 Ones that are being offered as ‘foraged’ from skanky urban rivers...no. But I’ve had some nice ones in the past. 
The whole story of how ‘delicious’ an easy to catch invasive species is was always too good to be true. See also muntjac and bloody rape seed oil
4121 2018-07-02 16:05:32 Drilling, transporting, refining oil has its own issues never mind the thermal efficiency of EV.  Competition is good plus the 100% torque @ zero rpm is intoxicating.

4125 2018-07-02 16:05:21 India should demand cash compensation from USA to follow his ban to purchase oil from Iran as Indian will have to pay higher price to purchase oil from other countries.
4126 2018-07-02 16:05:20 Get a gentle cleanser with salicylic acid, ensure all products you use are oil free. Invest in a good face moisturizer like a Cetaphil, neutrogena or aveeno. They have some great oil free ones. You can also buy some oil absorbing sheets to use throughout the day

4129 2018-07-02 16:05:19 Dear online “coaches”: if you are going to claim that you can help clients achieve the success they dream of, you damn well better have proof you’ve achieved that same success yourself. Otherwise you’re just selling snake oil.
4130 2018-07-02 16:04:56 You are very kind. It's the oil and water thing that makes it hard to explain, but so long as it works, that's all that matters!

4170 2018-07-02 16:02:25 .... not too mention Trump has increased military spending, has forced NATO to increase military spending, has pushed for more energy independence which hurts Russia's oil/gas industry, approved Pipelines, and pulled out of Iran deal.  All things that Putin does not want to see.

4234 2018-07-02 15:56:03 Yrs ago US refining was heavily favored towards sweet crude..(Brent)
It seems to be more heavily favoring the dirtier, bunker (C) type from Middle East.
between Brent oil embargo lifted and Saudi owning largest refinery in US (2013) .the great deceiver's gifts to his handlers.
4235 2018-07-02 15:55:57 That's not a great comparison for a few reasons. Rosneft, for one, did that as a last resort bc of China's disinterest. It didn't radically improve corporate governance in a broader sense, it launched a buyback to please investors by using share prices on the back of oil prices.

4266 2018-07-02 15:53:20 It’s stupid economics. The oil companies don’t just absorb the cost of taxes. They included it in the cost of what they sell. So, Alaskans get money from oil company taxes and then have to use that money to pay higher prices.

4328 2018-07-02 15:48:49 Sad that the fact deniers can’t look up any facts at all so I guess We shouldn’t be surprised they don’t know there’s no gmo’s in the oil. It shouldn’t matter anyway, oil or meal or whatever, gmo’s don’t do any harm and do a lot of good. They could do a lot more yet.
4329 2018-07-02 15:48:49 It’s so yum! I make a pretty easy seasoning for all the veggies I roast. Olive oil, salt, pepper, minced garlic (LOTS) and a little Siracha.
4330 2018-07-02 15:48:39 I hope India will not come under pressure of any country to stops oil import from Iran. We are also a independent country to take our own dicissions .
4331 2018-07-02 15:48:30 So Charles do give advise on Stamp Collecting while Trump the TEXTING BEAR MARKET is in office?I guess after CRUSHING the Dow& AG with tariffs he had missed the Oil & Gas industry...So he KNEE CAPPED Oil&Gas this weekend??

4339 2018-07-02 15:47:49 USA has even greater oil reserves. But instead of being public, the revenue goes to a few billionaires rather than the citizens. Norway has no resource advantage over US, just better management and vision.

the wonders of cbd oil
4352 2018-07-02 15:46:49 I thought it was a clear, light oil, colour.
I suppose it could be 'light oil with a hint of tea'!
4353 2018-07-02 15:46:44 In reply: 1) they weren’t raking it in when oil price fell. WM had to prop NS up 2) same as any business or they go bust. It’s also a reason why NS is still in production as costs have fallen. 3)finding oil is fine but they’ll only extract it if the oil price is high enough.

4378 2018-07-02 15:44:55 "Oil & Gas executive" tries to portray former waitress who grew up in a small vets house as "elite."  Precious.  Really precious.  Scared much of this change?

4382 2018-07-02 15:44:38 ANOTHER FAIL! King Salman of Saudi Arabia denies Trump (crook) plea for more Saudi oil before mid-term elections. His "great negotiator" schtick ("trade wars are easy") being debunked repeatedly. See NoKo's Kim Jung Un, China's Xi; Canada's Trudeau, Harley Davidson, et al!
4383 2018-07-02 15:44:32 I will believe it when I see it in writing. He is con man who worked for a snake oil salesmen. Don’t believe a word they say.

4388 2018-07-02 15:44:19 Just right! I hope they slather themselves in tanning oil so people passing by can hear the fat sizzle.
4389 2018-07-02 15:44:19 Fair but not sure it's a stretch to think he can do it. In all honesty, the key will likely end up being Hamonic. He wasn't good last year but the question now becomes, was it a blip or is that who he is now.

4425 2018-07-02 15:40:26 Their fries are cooked in peanut oil.  No soy or gluten so vegan though not advertised.  I am on a strict diet plus try to be vegan.  Shared fryers at McDonalds aren’t vegan just dedicated ones that only cooks fries.  The veggie is sautéed veggies and toppings. Just do fries
4426 2018-07-02 15:40:23 As front prices were bottoming around $26 we had supercontango like that. It was the same phenomenon in reverse. DOesn't matter what the fundamentals say the oil is 'worth' - if all the storage tanks are full, it's worth less. Conversely, if all the storage tanks are running dry.
4427 2018-07-02 15:40:19 Menurutku semua oil baunya gitu,purivera juga
4428 2018-07-02 15:40:18 Starting today, homeowners who are “pooled” for oil and gas development, where their minerals rights are extracted by a company without them agreeing to it, are protected from any liability for accidents.

4461 2018-07-02 15:38:02 Christ, I just checked my bank statement and I bought exotic olive oil, a cast iron skillet and a $500 suitcase designed by fucking Dwayne Wade on Saturday night. ¿Who am I when I’m drunk?

4467 2018-07-02 15:37:28 Libya's national oil corporation has warned that port blockades in the east of the country could result in the loss of some eight-hundred and fifty thousand barrels of crude oil per day.
4468 2018-07-02 15:37:13 It was for sure. There is no way the British establishment would so easily give up our oil, our land, our natural resources, etc. The top few % are holding on to us as a colony; a possession. Things must be done differently next time. Very differently.

4470 2018-07-02 15:37:02 My suburban white dad, 63, was a lifelong Republican until Trump. He doesn't care for Nazis or authoritarians and still believes in free trade & less government. Good men don't trade their core beliefs for a snake oil salesman who speaks at a 2nd grade level.
4471 2018-07-02 15:37:01 Put Dead Sea salt in a bath, it heals and smooths the skin.  To remove persistent scaly patches of skin, rub affected areas with Avocado oil,  It has healing properties and will lift the scaly skin.  For eczema, swellings & bites rub inside of fresh hot chilli on skin. it works.

4518 2018-07-02 15:32:22 Mr. Kenney is no different than the PC "leaders" we have had in the past; I am curious if big oil is funding his path. Also the UCP folks don't seem to be any more capable or experienced than the NDP folks we elected so this means the future will be rocky as big learning curve.
4519 2018-07-02 15:32:20 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4520 2018-07-02 15:32:12 By left, I had in mind especially the economic policies of the 1970s (e.g. 'desarrollo compartido,' increased public expenditure with oil revenues, etc.) -- though they were not aligned, in many occasions, with other leftist movements. How would you classify it?

4724 2018-07-02 15:12:44 Just when you thought the craziness was over! Don't be fooled by slight weakness in flat price. August #WTI just hit a $2 premium to September after Genscape showed another big week-on-week draw at Cushing. That's the biggest premium since August 2014 btw #oil #energy

4738 2018-07-02 15:11:29 So i used to have this and I now have a spoon of coconut oil in with my first cup of coffee in the morning. Cleared up the dry skin and does not taste too bad either. Just make sure the stuff is melted in your brew and drink. Looks like an oil slick but you get used to it.
4739 2018-07-02 15:11:28 oil is life
4740 2018-07-02 15:11:20 But we should talk website navigation and UI for Oil and Gas websites because if people can't see what your product is, how will they know what to contact you for? Especially when you sell products and services.

4758 2018-07-02 15:09:32 I had not heard of this tragedy. I know that they took the Cherokee Tribe from the Blue Ridge Mtns-President Jackson- sometime around 1835- and marched them to Oklahoma- 4000 died, it is called "The Trail of Tears." They struck oil. Oklahoma was the "Indian Territory'
4759 2018-07-02 15:09:24 Because they need us they need our land that oil gold diamond natural rubber is not gonna fall on their lands like rain that's why they won't let go of our continent

We could have economic justice in the USA but for MIC buffoons like Bill
4767 2018-07-02 15:08:35 Am I the only one that sees what @realDonaldTrump is trying to do with the tariffs? We can make steal here. We can grow tomatoes and make our own ketchup here. We can drill for and produce our own oil. Start making our own goods and we don't have to worry about a "trade war"!
4768 2018-07-02 15:08:31 Oil production doesn't belong to Scotland and never has the rigs are in UK waters. As for the rest, I didn't say Scotland was a basket case but they would be without UK imports (£46b) from Scotland and without Barnet (£55b) and UK Military.(£4 to 5b). With a current £15b deficit
4769 2018-07-02 15:08:31 Use warm olive oil works a treat

4774 2018-07-02 15:07:30 That is true but a small handful of idiots in BC, Ontario and Quebec just dont understand that. The Federal Government is no big fan of oil and gas sector either. Just absolute disgrace how the energy sector is treated in this Country. Sicking

4787 2018-07-02 15:06:52 Omg I’m getting an oil change in my car. I always go inside to wait because driving on those ramp things freak me out. One of the workers is sorting new T-shirt’s for the staff. He goes “hey you want a staff T-shirt?” 
4788 2018-07-02 15:06:49 Meanwhile, he is depleting our oil reserves.

4791 2018-07-02 15:06:37 Not true. They were able to "fix" problems that impacted them STAT. Remember the leg for corporate/union donations?How about the cash being given to the oil companies from Carbon taxes? They can do whatever they want with the political will. Just no political will/guts. @jkenney

4793 2018-07-02 15:06:31 Female Bernie Sanders. Modern day snake oil salesman.
4794 2018-07-02 15:06:30 Yes, last time oil prices were high it hit £1.5 per litre which is about $7 per gallon. $6 per gallon is pretty typical for the UK over the last five years or so and similar in most of Europe to be fair.
4795 2018-07-02 15:06:26 I have an honorable compromise . Just #WalkAway. Give me your pump , the oil , the gasoline , the whole compound and I’ll spare you your lives . Just walk away and we’ll give you safe passage in the wasteland . Just walk  away and there will be an end to the horror
4796 2018-07-02 15:06:20 I totally agree. This is another shiny object from a snake oil salesman.

Please don't be biased toward coal, help domestic Oil & Gas too please. Our jobs & $ depend on higher oil $.

4819 2018-07-02 15:04:58 You’re an oil tarif away from total collapse.
4820 2018-07-02 15:04:43 Between the 200k oil jobs and now possibly 160-170k auto industry jobs that have been list, how is it even possible to make an economic case for your carbon tax?

I'd ask you to rub some brain cells together to start a fire but you'd probably tax it.

Should’ve been smart about dealing with @Iran , they don’t care neither. They make private sales of their oil, they control Iraq oil fields thru proxies and they just won the Syrian war. So much winning!

4857 2018-07-02 15:02:42 Optimum word there being that "worked". Great to See YA out of the way, next would be the injunction in #UKOG favor as they are not against peaceful protests and then finally a convoy of oil tankers filled to the brim as HH has delivered an even better onshore flow record.
4858 2018-07-02 15:02:29 just saw that. thanks! everyone in the oil markets are talking about iran and venezuela, but those represent past and "future" changes to some extent. libya should be front and center.
4859 2018-07-02 15:02:23 Sounds like a man who wants to go to war. Anointed by Holy Oil (by the barrel). Santus, santus, santus, no alt clean fuels before me
4860 2018-07-02 15:02:15 No .. oil price!
4861 2018-07-02 15:02:10 Had an appointment for an oil change at 9am and here I am at 11 still waiting

4866 2018-07-02 15:01:37 All they need do is tell her a lie, she'll pounce on the chance to endorse knowing she won't have to own it. Just like Murkowski did when she opened up Alaska to oil drilling.
4867 2018-07-02 15:01:30 Oil prices going higher soon

4870 2018-07-02 15:01:25 Scotland IS the highest Taxed part of the UK , in stealth taxes and direct theft.

What nation takes 8% of the oil it owns , while its neighbour takes 92% , and then some as it turns out with oil and gas "origins".
4871 2018-07-02 15:01:23 It was a small cup of oil that turned the miserable widow into an oil merchant (2 Kings 4:1-7). It was an ordinary sling and stone that David used to bring down the enemy of Israel #LifeAndIssues
4872 2018-07-02 15:01:14 He thinks behind the times more in favor of oil and coal. Big business
4873 2018-07-02 15:01:09 Sat in sun with carrot oil on for 2 hours first but nothing actual happened, am cursed with goff skin

4877 2018-07-02 15:00:57 I went to go get the oil in my car changed and the woman who helped me check in noticed my @AmberScholl necklace because she watches her videos too. We of course proceeded to bond over Amber. My day was made!
4878 2018-07-02 15:00:55 Statement is also a lie, SA has not agreed, not have they ramped up anything but their newfound disrespect for #TraitorTrump and the #CorruptGOP They will do what's best for SA, not US. Obama forced them to lower oil prices, #TraitorTrump and ND his followers are cowards.
4879 2018-07-02 15:00:48 That oil change reminder in the dash just taunting a nigga
4880 2018-07-02 15:00:47 Or his desire to bait higher oil price with a blatant tweet attempting to fish contra-actions... what a pro.
4881 2018-07-02 15:00:47 As I already mentioned, that was never the point but rather that they have little choice b/c of their current roster and cap predicament...be it via free agency or trade.

4896 2018-07-02 14:58:49 @POTUS #MAGA2020 @seanhannity ask this question. USA consumes 20 million barrels of oil daily. We import half. How would our economy grow if we were self sufficient producing 20 million barrels daily. Oil industry jobs are high paying jobs. Tax revenue and growth would explode.
4897 2018-07-02 14:58:45 $SAEX Whoa !!!! this stock is on FIRE !!! Oil names are HOT Increased my position on $RCON can go parabolic over 1.52. Target 2.25 area
4898 2018-07-02 14:58:36 we do know that. They also had some very bad management of their oil wealth and a broken democracy that is rigged to keep their corrupt and incompitent leader in power.
4899 2018-07-02 14:58:32 Also, it’s my main cooking oil.

4913 2018-07-02 14:57:17 Coconut oil purportedly to be the new power food. 

But it tastes nice though, especially with grilled fish.
4914 2018-07-02 14:57:13 Let's be clear.
None of the 911 attackers were from Iran.

They were form Saudi Arabia!!!!!!--

4916 2018-07-02 14:57:11 In a nutshell, I do not foresee any attempt of formal counter-reform. I would expect coziness with CFE but @CRE_Mexico has the tools to protect the market. There have been some absurd pro-fuel oil statements from projected Energy Secretary. #BadButNotTooBad
4917 2018-07-02 14:56:55 All of the oil n gas fields I’ve been in here in California are loaded with game birds as well as other critters. Is there a thought that the sage grouse won’t do well with this intrusion?
4918 2018-07-02 14:56:50 Trump isn't going to do anything. Putin wants higher oil prices - that's why Trump bailed on Iran deal .  Trump can complain and lie but Trump isn't going to do ANYTHING to lower oil prices. Trump just wants to be able to blame other people/countries for oil hitting $100 barrel
4919 2018-07-02 14:56:49 Yes, the entire carbon tax thing in Canada is immoral. You guys should build more pipelines and get the oil sands revenue flowing!
You guys are so lucky to have such a resource.
 Electricity is cheaper with less unreliable intermittent renewable sources in the mix.
4920 2018-07-02 14:56:48 What #China did to #Venezuela: paid for oil in advance, the Socialist regime wasted the money without investing in infrastructure needed to maintain the production level, so the money is gone, #oil is already paid for (in credit to buy Chinese junk) and production declining
4921 2018-07-02 14:56:46 Except that Trump's foreign policy is now uber-hawkish. E.g. he's destabilizing Iran's economy for no reason other than pleasing his donors & Saudi/Emirati/Israeli friends. Oil prices are up & war with Iran on the horizon, with decades if horrendous consequences.

4924 2018-07-02 14:56:30 Pls oil prices are well over $80 per barrell obj met oil prices at $16 a barrel and was able to do a better job and save well over $60bn and still have our debts wiped out so what else do want to hang on to. A lazy man always blames his tools

4929 2018-07-02 14:56:08 Tim: NAFTA in trouble. Big federal / AB deficits. No export pipelines, so Cda loses $15 billion a yr on oil exports (per Scotia). Oil and gas investment going south. 100K oilpatch jobs lost. Ont biggest subnational debtor in world. While US ec growing 2X faster than Cda.

4932 2018-07-02 14:56:05 Foreign investment in oil is a slippery slope, but if handled with an iron fist might be a strategy to bring corrupt Pemex to heel. One of the most inefficient impossible to deal with bureaucracies I ever sold fire protection to.
4933 2018-07-02 14:55:58 When stocks dump, oil will follow suit, as it typically does.
4934 2018-07-02 14:55:52 Been up for 2 hrs, and it's not even 8 am yet.

4991 2018-07-02 14:50:26 The oil rigs question was actually a general question not directed to any ship at all. Misha was the one who joked about GENERAL fanfic there, and all Jensen did was add on to it by saying "don't disappoint." for humor. I didn't see any support by Jensen for Destiel there.

5125 2018-07-02 14:38:30 Saudi money bribes most US politicians. They are second behind AIPAC in terms of buying influence and silence. In addition, US oil companies does a lot of business with Saudi. Iran was once a US stooge. Lesson to Saudi Arabia?

5156 2018-07-02 14:36:11 I'm thinking you'd have no issue with their investing in oil stocks? Renewable energy is an excellent bet because demands are only going to increase. Both would provide a return on investment and only one is good for our environment. Good moral investments are doable.

5159 2018-07-02 14:35:55 The other day my partner decided to cook kale for our son. He responded by sucking on it to get the oil then throwing it on the floor. This is the right way to eat kale, I think.

5276 2018-07-02 14:21:42 Honestly, rub anything oil based on your eyes prior to washing your face and I promise you won’t have that problem sis
5277 2018-07-02 14:21:42 Took me 3+ times to keluar masuk MUJI tu actually buy the cleansing oil and I FINALLY BOUGHT IT TODAY!!!
Verdict: so nice it removes all my make ups and the oil doesnt stick on my face after i rinse it off.

5313 2018-07-02 14:18:10 It is important to remember to oil up your garage door springs & track every 6 months. A good tool to use this for this is a can of WD-40!
5314 2018-07-02 14:18:06 And there’s the conundrum. Frackers will only uncap their wells when oil approaches $80 per barrel. By then most consumers are pulling in their horns and growth is capped again at 2%.

5365 2018-07-02 14:12:38 Got my oil changed this morning, but I couldn’t answer any of their questions about my car and asked them if I should just call my dad so they could talk to him. 
So basically this morning I realized I am NOT a strong independent woman and I do, in fact, need a man.
5366 2018-07-02 14:12:35 I was surprised as I saw the contents of small glass bottle for the essential oil. The other day I bought it coz it was discounted. I thought the bottle always should be full. But seeing the label well, it was written 2ml. The smell of Frankincense is so good and make me relax
5367 2018-07-02 14:12:29 i think i need to buy a peach scented candle/essential oil cause every time i buy peaches and have them laying around my room smells soooo good
5368 2018-07-02 14:12:27 The dressing is peach balsamic from seven barrels with olive oil and lime juice. Yes, the cheese is feta and I use red peppers instead of tomatoes because the boys hate them.

5370 2018-07-02 14:12:17 America should supply the oil@ same rates.
5371 2018-07-02 14:12:07 Almost always 20% or more unless service was really terrible, but never less than 15%! Oil is changed as recommended, maybe a little over on mileage. I would like to say I’m more gen X. I’m in that middle ground between Gen X and millennials
5372 2018-07-02 14:12:02 What apostacy!  Oil was almost always olive or a perfume base - never weed base. Lol

5411 2018-07-02 14:07:49 Any time you remove a significant amount of oil from the market, all else equal, it will drive oil prices higher.  Not a fan of economic sanctions, which are often a precursor to outright military conflict.  $90/bbl crude oil will motivate US frackers to increase supply.

5458 2018-07-02 14:02:23 The bulk of the value in the oil barrel is the gasoline. The incentive has been: if you can find value in any of the other by-products, your refinery will become dramatically more profitable. Definitely a huge incentive, hence the significant R&D

5561 2018-07-02 13:49:03 Sad. I saw this Documentary on Cuba after peak oil and they gave land to anyone who would farm it. We should use land to address extreme economic inequality and decrease the industrial farming that's killing the soil and bees.

5586 2018-07-02 13:44:57 What he should be focusing on is moving consumer demand away from increasing oil demanding products? Other viable options growing, should be supported. Tesla leading the way on this one. Needs to get behind this change. Not wrong!
5587 2018-07-02 13:44:57 Yes you need to build economic reforms not close oil. Oil ports will continue to be closed for every issue. Examples: 1. Raise price of fuel 2. Change CB exchange rate... some people do not want this to change, a lot of people are making money due to status quo including east

5640 2018-07-02 13:39:09 For sure. That‘s how Saudi Arabia decides on oil production - being told by POTUS. Also remember that the USA are an oil exporting country, means it produces more oil than domestically needed.
5641 2018-07-02 13:39:04 Potable water is the new Oil

Think of it as US Population Control.
5642 2018-07-02 13:39:01 Trump Tweeted that Saudi Arabia has agreed to raise production to 2 million barrels per day.  Oil is only down slightly.  This may be the selling opportunity bears have been waiting for.  Lack of strong downward reaction is suspicious, but it may be an effort to delay inevitable.
5643 2018-07-02 13:38:59 Stocks - down
Oil - up
Deficit - up
Medicare and Social Security - Cut

When you look past the end of your nose at what is coming down the economic road, there isn’t a lot of comfort.
5644 2018-07-02 13:38:58 Senate.... pretty sure at least. 
Also I may as well say that I disagree, and think that at the very least they'd force Trump to pick more centrist nominees, hopefully it won't matter though, unless they somehow prevent Kennedy's replacement oil after next January, which I doubt.

5649 2018-07-02 13:38:37 It is entirely reasonable to define the GOP based on the stated policy positions of its elected officials. How else would we define it? The TX delegation for example has been remarkably silent & dissent has been timid even tho’ the policies are bad for TX oil, gas, wind & solar.
5650 2018-07-02 13:38:12 The Americas (which include US, Canada and Mexico) produced a total of 20.5 million barrels of oil per day in June. The United States and Canada still rely on imports from Latin America and the Middle-East (primarily the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela). #Transpillar
5651 2018-07-02 13:38:12 Putin has murdered over 21 journalists who were critical of him. He also downed MH17. Also Russia has absolutely nothing the US needs or depends on. Not even oil. A shitty economy. Rampant unemployment. Trump is the ONLY one who needs something from that serial killer

5653 2018-07-02 13:38:08 How long oil takes to decompose is dependent on a lot of variables. Microbes will eat the oil but at different rates under different conditions. A climax forest around here takes about 700 years to develop, so it's not just when is the oil gone but when does the land recover.

5659 2018-07-02 13:37:27 No. Ricin is not soluble in fat or oil. When you produce castor oil, the ricin remains in the mash that's left over.
5660 2018-07-02 13:37:24 Capitalism is nothing more than using your "dollar vote" to purchase what is most important to you.  Capitalism is not bad unless you dont trust yourself; "creative destruction" is not tail-swallowing unless you want subsistence living by whale oil lamplight. Claim is unbalanced.
5661 2018-07-02 13:37:05 Hopefully oil price goes up.

5683 2018-07-02 13:35:00 Rule of Thumb- change the oil every 5000 km or 3 months.
5684 2018-07-02 13:34:58 Why do you need oil when everything can run on Gaumutra
5685 2018-07-02 13:34:51 Well, "plenty"? We've seen oil inventories fall 119 million barrels since March 2017, or 22%. Inventories would last 19.8 days at current demand of 21 million barrels per day.

5697 2018-07-02 13:33:12 Our lazy sorry ass caused us to depend on crude oil solely, and drop all other means. Agriculture went down, all other raw material we have are wasted under the ground. Until we find ourself we can't move nowhere.

5700 2018-07-02 13:32:46 We had ants at our old house - we had a ‘green’ pest control guy and he used some kind of orange oil. But he would find the next and put it there I think, so usually outside
5701 2018-07-02 13:32:24 That wasn't that long ago. Tony Blair was Prime Minister. Ken Livingstone was Mayor of London despite not being the Labour candidate. Ken negotiated a deal to get cheap oil from a poor country in the name of Socialism.

But less sure risk taking wld've run all that much faster w/o oil crash. 1, was v sector specific, which limits contamination & 2, there were many who refused to buy into recovery for any reason bc politics
5715 2018-07-02 13:31:26 It's all good. Trump said Saudi Arabia is going to increase oil production. Nothing to worry about. Just like the tariffs on all of our allies! 
5716 2018-07-02 13:31:21 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.

Not talking campaign contributions *to* her - what did *she* do that merits this criticism? I never hear any specifics - like people are just repeating talking points they want to believe.
5732 2018-07-02 13:29:45 Let's face it, you don't put a person who doesn't support public education on charge of the Dept of Education.  You don't put the world's richest oil man in charge of the EPA. You don't put people who hate LBGQT as Vice President and Attorney General.

Cannabis Oil existed
Oil mentioned in Bible
So cannabis was used by Jesus

That is 1 massive assumption that oil mentioned in bible was cannabis oil.  We can't prove otherwise so run with it.  The article reads like an Ancient Aliens episode, total lack of proof.

5746 2018-07-02 13:28:13 Problem is Alex, if that happens, there is a danger of a monopoly forming (if that is what you meant). In Europe, two of the biggest providers are already bought out by two big oil companies. Danger is that they will deliberatly overprice to dissuade people from tanking electrons

5786 2018-07-02 13:24:09 Another way to put it: Even if the United States pumped enough oil to meet our own appetite for oil one day, it still wouldn’t necessarily make financial sense for American refineries to buy American crude oil. Foreign crudes might still be cheaper, even with shipping costs.

5800 2018-07-02 13:21:57 Notice how they respond to all the positive replies but not this one. The fact that they put oil in their products is awful on so many levels. Like... Hey, how about some vegetable oil in your coffee ... Ew...

5802 2018-07-02 13:21:40 We won’t stop importing oil because many of our refineries make more money processing heavy crude from Canada, Venezuela, etc. Likewise, we sell our light crude to markets with refineries engineered for those grades. In short, it’s a free market. Refiners will chase discounts.

5812 2018-07-02 13:20:53 AND NOW THIS: #Russia Oil Output Reached a 16-Month High in June. Nation’s oil companies pumped about 11.06 million barrels a day, 90,000 more than in May, preliminary data from the Energy Ministry show. @MaznevaElena & Dina Khrennikova #Oil #OPEC #OOTT
5813 2018-07-02 13:20:49 Coal/Oil/CNG are just burning fossilized sunlight energy that collected over millennia.

There is no other viable path for our energy future, than renewables.

Harvesting the power of the sun, directly (solar) or indirectly (wind ),
Geothermal energy.

5815 2018-07-02 13:20:29 Trickle down economics is underpinned by cheap oil fuelling the myth of infinite economic growth. Now that oil isn’t so cheap anymore is it a wonder that the masses are seeing through the charade? #qanda #auspol

5822 2018-07-02 13:19:42 Try to keep your hair moisturised at least, so oil/moisturise your hair every 2 two days. Try to wash your hair every week and make sure you pre-poo & deep condition your hair every time. Find products that work for you and your hair type whether you have dry hair etc

5830 2018-07-02 13:18:52 Going to be the next great (poorly designed) health service improvement (unproven) 'initiative' debacle; which will then create buckletloads of jobs for remedy peddling snake oil salespeople and many, many consultants (non medical types).
5831 2018-07-02 13:18:49 did a quick coconut oil mask on my hair last night and my hair has literally never felt better

5835 2018-07-02 13:18:01 We can imagine, must have been a big shock. I used to get salmon oil for my skin, it does help. We hope your hair grows back quickly. I must be a weird a husky, even ice cubes I am not that keen on, BOL! Now ice cream, I like that! ;)

5837 2018-07-02 13:17:51 Everything in the world is made up of chemicals.....you can’t have an essential oil that is chemical free....
5838 2018-07-02 13:17:49 @cvpayne ask this question. USA consumes 20 million barrels of oil daily. We import half. How would our economy grow if we were self sufficient producing 20 million barrels daily. Oil industry jobs are high paying job. Tax revenue and growth would explode.
5839 2018-07-02 13:17:48 Og hash oil
5840 2018-07-02 13:17:41 No this is insane, you cannot possibly assume that oil platforms are immovable. Ekofisk was the biggest example of subsidence but it happens to some degree in all cases... it's called compaction drive.
5841 2018-07-02 13:17:24 The oil will run out the next day after Scotland becomes indy so we will have to generate all our power by feeding our cattle beans to make methane. 
Oh no - but where will we get money to buy the beans??#TweetLikeGordonBrown
5842 2018-07-02 13:17:21 Try adding rosehip or marula oil as a final step too if you don’t already
5843 2018-07-02 13:17:18 Mexico has more oil, more agricultural land, coastal property than the u.s. yet people are risking their lives to escape! Mexico, its time to get it together!!

5846 2018-07-02 13:17:06 Show of hands.  How many people didn’t see that coming? It’s the same old trickle down economics snake oil they’ve been selling since the Middle Ages.  While you’re still waiting for your payday, fat cats are burning $100 bills lighting their cigars and laughing at you.
5847 2018-07-02 13:17:03 Ohhh, I thought the previous tweet was some kind of euphemism! You really are actually having an oil change!

Cool. Just ask them if the oil smells burnt or anything, and make sure there's no metal shavings in there. If not, you're good to go!

I'm sure your big end is just fine.
5848 2018-07-02 13:17:02 He already made the key point,during GEJ rule Nigeria experienced oil boom and alot of money was made and almost all was stole.But bcos alot of money was coming in den we didn't see the effect until now.Pls let's be realistic GEJ and his goons chronically looted d nation dry

5850 2018-07-02 13:16:52 China and Russia are hoarding gold, countries are finding a way around using USD to acquire oil. It’s coming, and sooner than we think.
5851 2018-07-02 13:16:45 Donald Trump working on reducing oil prices,your my Hero we are paying $7.00 almost for a gallon of regular. You Americans would pull your hair out if it cost that much,help your allies,talk to the Arab oil minister Please.
5852 2018-07-02 13:16:45 I've always been interested in the what ifs of history. WW2 is full of what ifs. biggest what ifs is Hitler himself. Why did he hold back at Dunkirk? Changed bombing RAF to cities; changed or overruled battle plans on Russia. What if assination attempts worked? Had access to oil?
5853 2018-07-02 13:16:35 HOW can you preach about healthy eating all the time yet put THAT much oil on the chicken

5874 2018-07-02 13:14:01 As a native Ohioan, I can't agree with you more. Ohio absolutely loathes both parties. Democrats can't seem to get that though. They roll in and drop a Jesus or two and talk about how to legislate jobs/equality, and the people see them as snake oil salesmen. They vote against.

5923 2018-07-02 13:07:30 Government bond prices remained off highs, as some traders booked profits after earlier rise. The fall in crude oil prices supported prices. Robust manufacturing PMI June strengthened the case for RBI rate hike. However, mood remained cautious before MSP announcement.

6088 2018-07-02 12:48:35 US policies has weaned the country off of Venezuelan & Middle-Eastern imported crude oil. Instead, they’ve developed a solid domestic shale-to-oil industry.

6115 2018-07-02 12:45:30 Prices have been rising since I was born in the 1980s globally. There's a recession due to low oil prices that happens to make up a large percentage of our export. That's why there is current hardship. The way out is to diversify the economy and it doesn't happen overnight.

6129 2018-07-02 12:43:35 I’m with Gareth here. Trump could even flood the market by releasing 100 million barrels from the Strategic Oil Reserves. We don’t have a shortage of oil and if needed, can buy back at lower prices during the next economic recession.

6161 2018-07-02 12:39:58 IMHO India should brazen it out. Trump needs to realise India really can't afford to stop buying oil from Iran.

Also, we should refuse to get arm twisted in this specific manner & stand up for ourselves.

6170 2018-07-02 12:38:35 Saturday am Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia king agreed with him to boost oil production by 2 mbpd.  That night @realdonaldtrump tweeted that SA king was maybe ready to do that.  Then Sunday morning--on tv--he says they should boost more than the 1 mbpd.  Trump LIES all the time.
6171 2018-07-02 12:38:33 Furthermore, the federal govt owns a shitload of highly valuable land and other natural resources, like oil reserves. Any conservative valuation of all USG assets would still dwarf outstanding USG liabilities.

6182 2018-07-02 12:37:02 Of course Trump was lying when he said Saudis were increasing oil production. That would lower prices hurting Russian economy so Putin wouldn't allow it.
6183 2018-07-02 12:37:00 How much are the oil companies paying them? And how will this benefit the populace? It's already a given that they could care less abt the gorillas or else there would be no considerstion in the first place!!
6184 2018-07-02 12:36:25 The oil was nasty too you weren’t missing out on much don’t worry 
6185 2018-07-02 12:36:20 Where would you prefer the U.K. gets its oil from if not from a very environmentally conscious, ‘non-fracking’ oil producer in a safe way? This is a big waste of time and money that you could use to help grow and promote green alternative fuels.
6186 2018-07-02 12:36:13 Nothing like an 8am oil change
6187 2018-07-02 12:36:09 The incentives will be credited after receipt of the same will be received from concerned oil companies.

6209 2018-07-02 12:33:39 Weekly World News, just way dangerous. My son started watching Alex Jones remix videos and joking “Alex Jones powers activate” then acting a fool.  I had to remind him that he’s an irresponsible snake oil salesman and his followers are dangerous.  We make fun but don’t forget.

itself.
6225 2018-07-02 12:31:24 helium is used for saturation diving in offshore oil industry (Heliox), it is very very expensive, we recycle it all the time but its becomming increasingly difficult to get it, we are moving to Hydreliox even tho hydrogen its extremely flamable its a lot cheaper.
6226 2018-07-02 12:31:18 Dear @realDonaldTrump, 
     I love my Great Lakes and the mutiple species that live in it and depend on it. Their will be an oil leak. It will wipe out fish,birds,deer and even more other species even a few humans but you might think what ever the price to make $...
6227 2018-07-02 12:31:16 Wasn't too long ago that @POTUS44 said there is nothing he can do about the price of oil.  Thankfully, @POTUS did not listen!
6228 2018-07-02 12:31:12 I did the maths, its doable , but yer looking at a minimum of 25 billion, and it displacing what could be oil rigs right into the Irish sea. NI in no way could afford that alone, uIrealand and iScotland plus EU = runner.

6233 2018-07-02 12:30:27 Norway, for example, also brings in a ton of revenue via oil and gas production from drilling in the North Sea. That’s how it’s funded.
6234 2018-07-02 12:30:27 Isn't it also because a lot if the general public seem to think cannabis means smoking and the political parties are terrified the public would presume they're encouraging smoking...?  Smoking's bad therefore cannabis is bad too.  Do you think?  Oil can't be smoked =  must be ok.
6235 2018-07-02 12:30:23 Really trying my best not to fall asleep in public while I wait to get my oil changed 
6236 2018-07-02 12:30:01 I haven't watched TV since years. So tell me something. 
Kya hum ab bhi cooking oil nach nach k  baichtay hain?
6237 2018-07-02 12:29:57 Except for that they have some oil, Mexico is pretty much irrelevant.  Just another socialist failure.

6243 2018-07-02 12:29:33 That oil and gas one is the worst line ever. Buhahahah
6244 2018-07-02 12:28:42 The only thing i feel is possible is, he transfer the oil to another tank... Or take it to the nearest fuel station and dump then fix his tank.
6245 2018-07-02 12:28:30 And this labour’s worthy of my higher.

I could also make the same argument about capitalism, since fascist governments are capitalist in nature. Nazis and Italian Fascism absolutely were.
6252 2018-07-02 12:27:20 Not dying of heat today! Getting my oil change then finishing setting up my PC and streaming later
6253 2018-07-02 12:27:16 It was just an oil that he gave people, it’s not like they were sitting around talking shit. Tho would explain most of the bible
6254 2018-07-02 12:27:15 It may be time for a new mattress! Though your sleep habits may not have changed, if your mattress is worn down it can cause muscular fatigue headaches.

Another thing you can try till you get to a doctor is peppermint oil. Rub a teeny tiny amount, not even a drop, under ur nose

6259 2018-07-02 12:26:32  I thought for so long it was bs then I finally tried it and now it’s all I put in my hair along with a little vitamin e oil. If I have extra time I section it off, put the gel in then comb it with the denman brush and diffuse it but that takes a while so it’s not done often

6264 2018-07-02 12:26:02 Все это конечно до поры до времени.Надо только понять,где тот предел,когда рванет и бараны превратятся в разъяренных быков.Людей недовольных Пыней и Ко на самом деле много,но многие ограничены труд.договором.На"NESTE OIL"например есть пункт,который запрещает ходить на митинги.
6265 2018-07-02 12:26:01 Agreed. Salad dressing here is rapeseed or pumpkin seed oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. Keep it simple.
6266 2018-07-02 12:25:57 If you can see a more honest response from any online fake snake oil system seller, I’ll stick a broom up my arse, and sweep the M1 while reciting Shakespeare.
6267 2018-07-02 12:25:56 I don’t think it is great, but still works. I am not the one working on this, but we think there is a pin missing from the oil pump? on the side of the gear box. Looks like the drive shaft has been spinning and not turning the pump due to the missing pin.

6273 2018-07-02 12:25:32 for me, it starts off dry, and then my skin over compensates for the oil lost. Like using it, my face feels well smooth and everything, just that after a while the oil production severly increases. Which is why i use black soap, cuz it dries out skin but mine is fine

6342 2018-07-02 12:15:03 It's all relative, isn't it. I'm wondering about the margin between utility and abuse, and where public ed/advertising makes a difference to our use of resources. 

Simple ex: I buy a Pnut Butter that is palm oil free, and I have no objection to stirring it before I use it.  1/

6349 2018-07-02 12:14:37 Crude Oil $CL_F has a monster of a weekend gap after opening up on Sunday $.82 lower. Looking for price to want to fill that gap at $74.25 before being able to do much else.
6350 2018-07-02 12:14:34 Gotta take my car to get an oil change

Not 20.

2.

Which I think might just be oil.
6355 2018-07-02 12:14:02 The problem is that this is industrial grade not medical. The canisters could contain oil and the threads could have swarf on them. Taking those into your lungs isn’t a good thing.

6368 2018-07-02 12:12:41 I think it started when the comparisons came in, everything after that was extra oil on the fire.
6369 2018-07-02 12:12:38 @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland please concentrate on oil export to non US, gas to non US and trade (in and out) with non US. Don’t only work on NAFTA and US retaliation but hang tough. When our stock markets crash, Trump will be gone

6412 2018-07-02 12:06:13 In my risk analysis to commercial shipping clients I have predicted (Solidarity Blockades) in the oil crescent fields more than 10 months ago! That the LNA may be forced to blockade oil ports indirectly, without falling into partition trap. This is what happened. Not unforseen!
6413 2018-07-02 12:06:08 Combination of just the right amount of just the right kind of olive oil, a light, just crunchy enough coating without overpowering the flavor  of the calamari,  and banana pepper slices for some zing. Try it - it's a RI staple...

6453 2018-07-02 12:00:13 But if you present it as subsidy per kWh (or oil equivalent) over last 10yrs then that would favour fossil fuels (ie they would look less subsidised using that metric) rather than renewables 2/2

6488 2018-07-02 11:55:35 So my car engine light came on is that normal after having my car for two months? Do I need an oil change? Lol help!
6489 2018-07-02 11:55:30 I have a great job thanks to President Trump if it wasn't for him the oil industry wouldn't be where it is

6500 2018-07-02 11:54:09 それな～～！！！！
もちろん！！！！！基本空いてるから共闘もマルチもいつでも誘ってね！
6501 2018-07-02 11:54:04 God Bless You Dear. Look into frankincense on the tongue. You need to find someone who knows how to properly dilute it in a carrier oil. Sending up prayers for you.
6502 2018-07-02 11:54:00 After you treat him, then he will recover and start stealing more transformer oil? If I was the person treating this common theif, I would add a few ccs of lethal poison to his iv line. Rats like this is why Nigeria is not moving forward, later, we will blame it on the government
6503 2018-07-02 11:53:55 Finding vegan food w/ no palm oil is so difficult
6504 2018-07-02 11:53:50 My dad who works in the oil industry is constantly perplexed by how are working patterns are determined and managed. But more tellingly, he is also amazed we have tolerated it for so long. #timeforchange
6505 2018-07-02 11:53:42 Nooooo. Do you deep condition weekly? Use a good leave in too and this needs to be reapplied at least every other day. Use oil to seal it in (not coconut). Then castor oil for edges and scalp. Please don't go back to the creamy crack sis

6507 2018-07-02 11:53:17 Cannabis. Is he using the oil? Hands down, that's what I would try. Frankincense as well. Blessings.
6508 2018-07-02 11:53:16 #AAOG should be a beauty to ride over the summer, especially with oil price rising.

6510 2018-07-02 11:53:03 You actually got an oil change?
What’s it been, 18,123 miles since the last one?
6511 2018-07-02 11:53:00 て～と騎殺はシャブ
6512 2018-07-02 11:52:40 pretty much a fishing  is main thing but the oil rigs help , with farming being a big thing, sheep are a huge part of our world, ,
6513 2018-07-02 11:52:38 What grain of salt? Everyone, every actor in Syria was buying - by proxy - oil from ISIS. It was hugely profitable and also a commodity very much in demand. That oil was (again, by middle men) being sold in Turkey.
6514 2018-07-02 11:52:23 Big week ahead for #AAOG as rig set to arrive while oil price continues to rise and pushes towards highs again.

Well over ask just paid for 100k shares and book switched beautifully today. 20p to be hit this month??
6515 2018-07-02 11:52:15 The real key to the oil crisis is not Haftar, but Khalid Mishri: President of the so called High Council of State. He did not even condmen Ibrahim Jadhran's attack on the oil crescent!
He can end the crisis by approving replacement of the current CBL Governor as agreed in Paris.
6516 2018-07-02 11:52:13 Good place for an oil change????
6517 2018-07-02 11:52:08 Doctors and Du30 is like oil and water. They dont mix

6519 2018-07-02 11:51:53 I was so broke, I had to cook rice with iru and maggi. No oil, no pepper, Nada. I cried while eating.
6520 2018-07-02 11:51:51 Bio oil?  Katanya kalau rajin pakai bisa hilang
6521 2018-07-02 11:51:48 WHY are you seeking more FOREIGN pumping of the same air clogging old crude oil?
You could give your #USA FARMERS a huge boost by keeping your PROMISE to allow #E15YearRound —We have been ready for MONTHS to be “allowed” to sell a DOMESTIC, renewable, clean fuel. America wins!
6522 2018-07-02 11:51:44 I have no compassion whatsoever for people like this. Electricity that is not even enough to serve the masses, then one greedy motherfucker will say he wants to go and steal transformer oil for his selfish interest. I’m sure this is not his first time. He should have died sef!!!
6523 2018-07-02 11:51:42 Is it Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, I hope?
6524 2018-07-02 11:51:37 You don't live on an island. What ever action you do, does reflect on other nations. Good or bad. Your luxury life has some effects on others who are poor: too many cars, too much food ( in fact in this case you are killing yourself and make pharmacies rich), electronics, oil.
6525 2018-07-02 11:51:23 I HAVE to get my oil changed this week I’ve put it off long enough
6526 2018-07-02 11:51:18 Aku jg gitu di kaki :(

6528 2018-07-02 11:50:38 If this was true then let me see you heal a blind person or a paraplegic with the cannabis oil? Blows your theory right out of the water! Explain that?
6529 2018-07-02 11:50:38 I use my coconut oil as a thermometer. If it's liquid it means it's too damn hot

6541 2018-07-02 11:48:51 A Democrat wouldn't call for state control of oil for the benefit of the people. Not a US Democrat anyway. More a capitalism reformer than socialist but I'll take it over the other neoliberal/right wing candidates
6542 2018-07-02 11:48:27 That just happens to be where Genie Oil and Gas claim huge reserves.

6552 2018-07-02 11:46:25 I was really curious as well since all my personal experience with Lush makeup has been really terrible. The main ingredient is coconut oil though and I am hella oily and I'm also worried the foundation stick will melt since I live in FL and my coconut oil is always liquid
6553 2018-07-02 11:46:18 Amazing you have people who believe this sh#t. I guess that is how we got Trump. They will buy anything from any snake oil salesman. Hope the Newtown families bankrupt you. @NewtownAction

6573 2018-07-02 11:42:51 You all are aware that Alaska taxes the hell out of its oil industry and gives the earnings to its citizens in a check.  For free.  Right?

That is almost perfectly an American example of socialism.  One that’s even too radical for the rest.  It’s a universal basic income.
6574 2018-07-02 11:42:27 I like you, not your cars or motorcycles. Unlike them, i was not breastfeed with oil.

6625 2018-07-02 11:34:48 Yes true , Soyabean oil (poor's oil) that cost around 1100 rs for 15 kg before GST now cost 1400 rs (fortune brand) . Absolutely Customer's r key winners because they have to pay 27% extra even after tax slab on oil come down from 28% to 5%.

But it's still a case of fringe dwellers or not, the voters still get force-fed the snake oil..And many are still buying it...
6667 2018-07-02 11:29:17 For anyone listening, that answer is roughly two. Two orders of magnitude greater. Meaning the subsidies you are *forced* to pay for oil and gas price manipulation is -at least- a hundred times more than renewable energy, of which Tesla is only a fraction.

6700 2018-07-02 11:25:15 I hope so. But no plan is complete without other side of Libya and UNSC. Grand delusions of partition are not implementable ina society so intertwined and oil revenues centralised despite differences. Neither Barqa nor western Libya have what it takes to manage public finance
6701 2018-07-02 11:25:03 It's reasonable not to want to be forced to pay carbon taxes and the like. But it's not reasonable to deny the science of climate change on that basis. 

But the "Tesla is subsidized" argument is a deflection. How many orders of magnitude greater are the subsidies for oil & gas?
6702 2018-07-02 11:24:45 And this was a lie. They did not agree to increase oil production. The White House is walking this back. Why are you posting it?

6946 2018-07-02 10:44:47 No one is pushing the idea of making oil our sole commodity while simultaneously inflating our currency to unbelievable levels.

6961 2018-07-02 10:43:05 If you can find it, I recommend clove oil. I found some at Walgreen's.  You only want to use a tiny amount because otherwise it burns like mad, but it's the best thing for tooth pain ever, and it kills infection at the same time.
6962 2018-07-02 10:42:57 From what I gather, Trade war between China and America is a major contributor, the war is leading to weakening of our currency and other emerging markets.

6976 2018-07-02 10:39:22 Best thing would have been to check the engine oil cap for OEM lube recommendation.

But because cars are not made specifically for Nigerian market/environment, I usually advice that you use at least SAE 20W/50 oil from a good local brand.

6977 2018-07-02 10:38:47 Yes indeed it is why I got interested in the JFK hearings and investigations. If they can cover up an assassination they can create false flags including the #skripal case. They need an excuse to remain in #Syria because they want the oil and gas reserves.
6978 2018-07-02 10:38:27 there is no single country or group that can carry the burden of balancing the oil market alone these days.
6979 2018-07-02 10:38:21 U may can check also from there and check the service standard and oil quality too.
6980 2018-07-02 10:38:10 We could export more soya to China, buy cheaper oil from US, get some factories to relocate to India etc. but all these are future possibilities. China is planning to reduce tariffs on 8500+ products from India & 4 other countries which will boost exports.

6983 2018-07-02 10:37:50 Actually oil isn't the driving force. Turkey for example barely has oil yet it's successful. These countries depend on trade, tourism, Industry, farming and other things for their success. Syria has oil but they don't depend as much and no they don't need foreign aid

7024 2018-07-02 10:29:21 The statement on the possible increase in oil production by 2 mln barrels per day came amid the continuing rise in oil prices after the decision by OPEC + and Russia to hike production by 1 mln barrels to compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran.

7200 2018-07-02 09:58:53 Absolutely right! Data is effectively, infinitely durable and reusable while oil is a finite resource. Data can be replicated indefinitely and moved around the world at the speed of light, at very low cost, through fiber optic networks unlike #oil.
7201 2018-07-02 09:58:52 Iran sits on the world’s largest proven gas reserves (1,200 trillion cubic feet, more than 18% of the global total) and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves (158 billion barrels, more than 9% of the total) after Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Canada

The saddest part is, Amerikkkans are so brainwashed by capitalism that they’re probably volunteering to do this.
7231 2018-07-02 09:53:34 "When the market tightens, because, for example, growth in supplies does not keep up with an increase in demand, the oil price becomes more sensitive to political developments – especially if they affect major producers."

7572 2018-07-02 08:52:39 Very difficult to go against the US in Iran oil trade. Already, India is planning to buy missile system from Russia, despite US warnings. But if US and Europe can thrash out a new and tighter N-Deal with Iran soon (not so likely), all this mess may not come to pass.

7592 2018-07-02 08:49:00 The petrodollar allows the US to print dollars to buy oil, but other countris have to sell for US dollars to by oil. This gives the US a huge advantage. The loss of this advantage will come as a huge shock to US citizens as the world slowly moves away from the US dollar.

7604 2018-07-02 08:47:34 And why not invest in solar energy instead of asking to produce more oil barrel?
Solar energy is cheap, clean and along with other forms of renewable energy produces more jobs than the production of energy through fossil fuels

7608 2018-07-02 08:46:38 Advice re. cloths used to oil wood (e.g. worktops) is not to bundle them up and store them sealed, for (I assume) this reason. Scary.
7609 2018-07-02 08:46:24 Indeed. If Eskom currently could produce to its maximum capacity our Treasury would be in a better position by pushing Sasol to produce to its maximum capacity with oil prices so high. Thus Eskom would benefit, Sasol would benefit and Treasury would garner huge windfall taxes.

Easier said than done.
India has invested in many oil fields from South America to Africa.
One must keep in mind that It takes decades to even get the project rolling.
OPEC control the oil prices as most of the oil producing nations are its members.

7703 2018-07-02 08:25:47 The crude oil price was $47/b this time last year. Today, a year later, it's over $70/b and set to go to $100/b due to sanctions on Iran. With RSA importing over 60% of its crude oil needs, it looks like we should brace ourselves for some hard times.

7826 2018-07-02 08:08:37 Many of us want to use natural mosquito repellents. We often hear about Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE). OLE is effective and safe as it needs low concentrations of DEET or Picaridin - only around 6-7% as it is also a natural repellent itself

7852 2018-07-02 08:04:02 Well that is good considering we just sold them a bunch of our F-15e strike eagles.  That is what allies should do for each other.  Try to figure out a way to treat Canada better while your at it. Rumor has it they have a small amount of oil there too and 99% of it comes here.
7853 2018-07-02 08:04:00 Did you know olive can normalize blood clotting? Olive oil contains phenols, which lower blood clotting in people with high cholesterol levels. This property of olive oil wards off cardiac issues and keeps the heart healthy.

7856 2018-07-02 08:03:43 It could be also because everybody is waiting for lower oil prices. Manufacturing in Vietnam hit all time high. Economy could be still strong.

7859 2018-07-02 08:03:14 Latest increase in oil and petroleum products are due to internationally determined market values of oil imports owing to sanctioned 3.2 million bbl oil reduction from Iran.

7882 2018-07-02 07:58:44 Oil isn’t everything mexico exports. Venezuela relies entirely on oil exports, and when the value of that decreases, their economy suffers greatly. Whereas mexico exports cars, electrical goods, food, and oil. Mexico also has the NAFTA deal with canada and usa, venezuela doesnt.

7885 2018-07-02 07:57:15 The 3 equality lessons in this video :
1. Acquire huge oil reserves and sell the pollution to someone else.
2. Use money from 1 to produce own green energy & healthcare. 
3. Have a small European populace.
Is that not a bit racist and callous?
7886 2018-07-02 07:57:12 Careful what you wish for.. it might just bite you in the butt. Canada is the 3rd oil supplier to your country.. you think your fuel is expensive now..? We supply you with the uranium to run you nuclear power plants. How you going to fuel your missiles..? Can tell you more..

So then about an hour later he goes, “Hey babe, olive oil” & winks at me... 
7895 2018-07-02 07:55:45 Not the best I’m afraid was swimming in oil..
7896 2018-07-02 07:55:43 Climate change is scientism and the hollow destructive cry of environmental soothsayers and fortune tellers. There is nothing wrong with the use of oil. Stop destroying the economy & jobs with rhetoric. No evidence for oil use link with historic warming & cooling trends. Wake up!

7912 2018-07-02 07:53:16 Yea but they have a ton of oil. It was the main income for the country. Its kindoff the cause of there problems aswell since you can always get cheap petrol but you need to trade money in weight.

8038 2018-07-02 07:27:08 What am saying is that if our projected revenues from the oil is say 10Tr it doesn't make economic sense to build a refinery costing a quarter or more of that. Algeria has the biggest in Africa at about 36000bbl/d. It has more oil than us.

8066 2018-07-02 07:21:38 Coconut oil! It's safe to lick, can help paws and hair balls.. just get the pure kind without smell. Some cats freak out about smells. Just rub it on during grooming.. There are many types in your grocery isle without scents..

8092 2018-07-02 07:17:52 However the government will reduce the oil imports enough to silence the US, US is an hegemonic power no doubt about that, their agents are everywhere from bureaucracy to the governments and advisors. The final decision is going to be balanced.
8093 2018-07-02 07:17:26 That is obviously happening because the oil industry has their hands and feet in journalism paying everybody to slander Elon Musk because he is the main person standing in the way of oil industry exploitation.

8103 2018-07-02 07:15:45 Este finde saldé una deuda y vi “El Asesinato de Jesse James por el cobarde Robert Ford”, gran película del 2007. Empecé a leer “Oil!” la novela de 1927 de Upton Sinclar que inspiró “There Will be blood”.  Y para cerrar, ya puedo twittear más de 140 caracteres. La vida es buena.
8104 2018-07-02 07:15:43 How does food get to the stores? How are they farmed, etc. fuel(oil) price has a fundamental impact on the price of everything we consume.
8105 2018-07-02 07:15:40 If South Africa was serious about its economy, we wouldn't be needing almost 50% of crude oil to produce fuel in SA via Chevron. Coal should've been optimised for fuel production.
8106 2018-07-02 07:15:29 Secondly, the congress spokesperson they are quoting, please ask them if they didn't do the same previously. Also many Indian refineries are only made to refine Iranian grade oil, it will only make them jobless.

8114 2018-07-02 07:13:41 You have a very scary debt now. China holds $1.18 trillion, Japan $1.03 trillion & Belgium is the third largest holder. Other large holders are the Carribean banking system & oil exporters.
8115 2018-07-02 07:13:23 Let's start by building pipelines so we have the power to boycott American oil and gas if we want to.
8116 2018-07-02 07:13:17 Not surprising: warm vs. cold winters. And Russie has lots of domestic thus cheap oil and gas.

8137 2018-07-02 07:09:57 "that Iranian regime change is the priority number 1 for the Saudis" Then they are going about it the wrong way. Sanctions strengthens the hard liners and weakens the moderates. Plus if oil prices go super high, Iran can live well on smuggling.

8222 2018-07-02 06:54:35 Sometime ago in Germany a million drivers left the cars on the main road for the day. The government reversed their oil price increase.
8223 2018-07-02 06:54:33 Than why did he ask SA to up their production. I've always known we could be independent of Arab  Nations oil, but our Die hard Environmentalist wont allow us to dig or pump for it.
8224 2018-07-02 06:54:28 We are being molested by the ANC, why are we not buying oil where we can get it cheaper like Iran or Sudan anyway?

8228 2018-07-02 06:52:56 Whoever this guy is on @BBCBreakfast talking about recruitment in retail is really selling snake oil. If you lose a long term job with M&S or the like, you will not be able to get the same employee benefits in a new position, and most likely you will have to step down rungs too.
8229 2018-07-02 06:52:33 God gave us the Garden of Eden which others baptized as Africa. Even oil is here apart from apples etc. Yet with all these wealth there is poverty. And now Uganda is taxing social media to raise revenue for the government. My Brother Shepherd Bushiri please pray for Africa!
8230 2018-07-02 06:52:30 Still, the whole petrodollar edifice lies on OPEC – and the House of Saud– pricing oil in US dollars; as everyone needs greenbacks to buy oil, everyone needs to buy (spiraling) U.S. debt. Beijing is set to break the system – as long as it takes./zh/oilprice.com

8238 2018-07-02 06:50:20 They are the ones that are making the fuel go up with the oil hike. So we stop buying it there and buy it at other garages that will force them to drop the price then that will force the other garages will drop their price.

8258 2018-07-02 06:46:22 You don't need huge oil reserves to plan for the future; plenty of countries have their own source of revenue, but have failed to invest, and that wealth has simply fallen into the hands of the wealthiest, who spend a relatively small portion.

8299 2018-07-02 06:39:04 Gas prices on 7/1/17 were 72 cents a gallon lower than now. Crude oil is $73 a barrel compared to $45 a barrel on 7/3/17 and Saudi Arabia said they never said they would increase production. Other than that..
8300 2018-07-02 06:38:44 You are full of crap ! Oil is 67$ a barrel. In 2008 it was 152 dollars a barrel and the same pump price as today. The U.S. Owned refineries are the rapists! You want cheaper barrel price to make even more profit
8301 2018-07-02 06:38:41 Piper Alpha was an oil production platform in the North Sea approximately 120 miles north-east of Aberdeen, Scotland, which exploded. 167 died

8458 2018-07-02 06:04:48 A persistent crunch in supply of fuel oil to Asia driven by reduced shipments from exporters like Iran and Venezuela has pushed a key fuel’s cash premium to Singapore prices to a three-year peak, with levels expected to stay high for another month.

8468 2018-07-02 06:01:46 You are correct...the full force of tariffs will be felt by the end of July, inflation is rising rapidly, oil prices are at an all time high in 9 years, wages are going down for 87% of American workers, interest rates wil go up 2 more times this year
8469 2018-07-02 06:01:20 I'm a good Democrat and a mailman in rural Alabama, and I make sure to eat every third item meant to be delivered to Trmp households. I just fry them up with a bit of oil, season with a bit of salt and voila! Down the hatch!

8472 2018-07-02 06:00:44 Can you go back and 're read my tweet? In case you can't this is what I said. That it's easy for someone to use the local grievances to start an oil war. It's the curse of oil in most of Africa with elites benefiting while marginalizing the local communities.

8513 2018-07-02 05:53:59 In 1971, OPEC countries raised oil prices & banked their oil dollars in European & US banks. Instead of the WB & IMF funding Africa's development, Europe & US lent us these oil dollars at very low interest rates but soon raised them hence our 80's debt crisis.
8514 2018-07-02 05:53:43 Wow this is weird, I've always had a very strong picture of the Christian God as a stern old bearded man, like in an oil painting. Maybe it's because I was raised Catholic.
8515 2018-07-02 05:53:31 After #Daraa the momentum will continue. Idlib, the oil fields, Afrin, Manbij, Al Hasake, Qamishli, Golan, Antakya. Some dream the war will end at the current state where #Syria is partitioned, but they will wake up from that dream as the Syrian army walks over their corpses.

8551 2018-07-02 05:46:33 everyday goods. In fact good old lack of oil use has caused them to need to take down these subsidies used to care for the population out of economic distress, they literally cannot afford to do what they used to because of the bigger countries leaning toward less oil consumtion.

We must lift Iran's oil export restrictions on US allies and ask Saudi Arabia to raise more than 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, to prevent the manipulation of vicious tickers by international speculators and the surge in oil prices.

8640 2018-07-02 05:28:41 Oil had nothing to do with it.

8677 2018-07-02 05:20:20 Yes. You are correct. PR fell off the radar day two post hurricane. And we won’t do shit for Guatemala or the civil unrest in Nicaragua either. Unless y’all suddenly turn white and/or find huge amounts of oil. I’m paraphrasing Mr. Pence, but it’s close.

8689 2018-07-02 05:18:23 Actually not sure even that.  Probably grease for the transaxle and the hinges for the doors and a few other spots.  AWD surely requires extra lubricants but no engine oil for sure and likely no transmission oil.

8742 2018-07-02 05:11:02 @FLOTUS The current surge in oil prices suggests that Iran should not accept oil supplies from its allies.
It is because of Iran's crude oil export restrictions, Saudi Arabia

8765 2018-07-02 05:06:30 It doesn't make them high but the medicinal value helps ALOT. Normal families cant afford the medication for meds to prevent seizures. One teaspoon of the cannabis oil has reduced a kid from having ten seizures per week to two.

Add cayenne in starting with 1/2 teaspoon. Add 1 teaspoon of cumin and cinnamon. Add more olive oil.  Continue adding more spices to taste
8780 2018-07-02 05:02:56 It’s funny how oil prices and and a strengthening dollar can be used to justify the madness happening in RSA. 6 months ago, it was the “incompetence” of former President Zuma that led to increases... Today it’s the “markets”

8785 2018-07-02 05:01:54 Overheating is driven by demand, not a supply-side shock like higher taxes or oil prices. Also, consumer spending seems to be slowing down, mainly thanks to TRAIN.

8802 2018-07-02 04:58:08 Please note that Pakistan has also tight gas & oil reserves.Good incentives of higher prices need to be offered to oil companies to invest on our land. If we can buy LNG for$10/Mmbtu, why cant we buy our locally produced gas for $8/Mmbtu. Just a proposal

8814 2018-07-02 04:55:53 @IvankaTrump Saudi Arabia needs to ask Saudi Arabia to increase at least 10 million barrels per day, as crude oil production in Iran and the Venezuelan oil industry are less than 4.7 million barrels a day.
8815 2018-07-02 04:55:50 No oil and gas companies pay their fucking taxes like every other industry in this country does. What you are really demanding is not having to pay taxes if you can’t get everyone to roll over and take oil. Oil & Gas do NOT PAY MORE TAXES!  So Fuck off already and deal with it!

8837 2018-07-02 04:53:27 @MorningLiveSABC Government's explaination about the petrol increase is a load of nonsense! A couple of years back the oil price was over $110 a barrel and our rand was almost R16/$, and back then we didn't have to pay this much!

8844 2018-07-02 04:52:12 Garlic oil, warmed up and 10 drops in each ear. Do one side at a time, and let sit in ear for 10-15 minutes, flip over and let drain for 5 minutes, then put a cotton ball in to soak the oil up and repeat on other side. Weird but it works for me

8856 2018-07-02 04:50:11 Schwarzenegger is (probably deliberately) employing the fallacy of false equivalence. Coal (& Oil & sunlight & atoms) are fuel/energy sources. 'Technology' would be that which is used to harness the fuel/energy source, not the source itself.

With petrol rising to above R16 per litre, why isn't there a contingency to cushion SAns from fluxes in oil price & other factors? Well, the state's strategic oil reserves were exactly that. Until gov sold them off at a pittance, $29 a barrel, two years ago. Thank you ANC

8873 2018-07-02 04:45:52 A drop or two of baby oil or peroxide might help.

8876 2018-07-02 04:45:37 I’ve researched the heck out of his actual experience. It’s grotesque. He like most ed “experts” are experts at making money and that’s about it. Just another snake oil salesman.

8879 2018-07-02 04:45:28 Check your Engine oil this morning.
8880 2018-07-02 04:45:27 This new tangerine oil I have is lifeeee. Diffusing it in my room makes my whole downstairs smells so good wtffff
8881 2018-07-02 04:45:16 Hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide otic can also be dripped into ur ear. Combine the peroxide w/ warm water in a bowl first. Then, follow the steps to apply it as u would for the oil above. u’ll likely get some fizzing,let it do this & keep your head at an angle til it stops
8882 2018-07-02 04:45:02 I like the water born oil stains because they absorb into the wood and fade over time rather than flake and peel like regular oil stains.
8883 2018-07-02 04:45:01 And it’s super ironic that you have pictures of pristine wild when Scott Pruitt wants to sell them off for oil and gas. Oh and charge you more to visit them, or is that Zinke? Both douchebags.
8884 2018-07-02 04:44:52 + open the oil, ready to pull out and replace that thumb with fingers that can stretch him more, but not before he finds out where that /spot/ is...
8885 2018-07-02 04:44:37 What?? Trump is raising our taxes??? Isn't that what he always claims Dems will do?  On a serious note though, working and fixed-income people will be the losers, Big Oil and speculators the winners.
8886 2018-07-02 04:44:34 Hind oil is also very good
8887 2018-07-02 04:44:23 I love a cum on your boobs and play with them like oil
8888 2018-07-02 04:44:04 Why an erstwhile FM should tell such blatant lies. There is no inflation  due to GST except for oil price. Only the tax evaders are facing the music. If you are with the cheats being a cheat is quiet ok. Don't talk about people.
8889 2018-07-02 04:43:51 Oil prices changes when
8890 2018-07-02 04:43:48 Oil falls amid rising Saudi output, Asian economic slowdown: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell by more than 1 percent on Monday as supplies from top exporter Saudi Arabia rose and as signs of an economic slowdown in Asia dented the outlook for demand.
8891 2018-07-02 04:43:44 You know what sucks? 

Every single time I open a jar of coconut oil, I see his pubes, after fucking some girl in our bed.
8892 2018-07-02 04:43:39 Yes, cedar. The stain is Cloverdale Sunfast. It’s a water born oil stain that gets absorbed by the wood rather than coat the surface like some oil stains. This is one coat on the garage that has been on for about 5 years now. We have the same stain on the house (9 years).

8895 2018-07-02 04:43:28 Don’t worry about the high oil prices, Trump told the Saudis to produce more, only they won’t verify it.

8898 2018-07-02 04:42:39 Try dripping mineral, olive, or baby oil into your clogged ear. Warm two to three tablespoons of your oil of choice, but be careful not to make it too hot.
8899 2018-07-02 04:42:36 Wait?? Baby oil to shave???

8903 2018-07-02 04:42:06 I am not sure if it is water or baby oil.
8904 2018-07-02 04:42:01 One thing is certain, with "Energy Independence" & America no longer reliant on ME oil, it changes everything! IF the US intervenes, as they did when Syria used chemical weapons on her own citizens, it will be because Iran use violence against their own people.
8905 2018-07-02 04:41:57 Main reason why Middle East remains tribal is because their growth &prosperity comes from oil. 

To keep natural resources, you need to act tribal.
To sell services & trade, you need to collaborate, accept, agree, and work with other tribes. So, you need to STOP being tribal
8906 2018-07-02 04:41:49 I think modern standards require lard instead of oil. At least with a proper long barrel. I still prefer my arquebus, and I use bacon grease or duck fat. Soros checks never cleared.

8908 2018-07-02 04:41:34 The biggest problem w oil/tar sands tailings ponds is that humans are impatient. They want a landscaped yard tomorrow. Reclamation certificates are only issued AFTER 40 yr to ensure the ecosystem is self-sustaining and it's not a bunch of sod tiles w decorative fountain.

8910 2018-07-02 04:41:11 A friend of mine is special assistant to the number three man at Chevron.

She said big part of the problem in Venezuela is that Chavez put cronies in positions of responsibility at the state oil company that they had no expertise in.

8928 2018-07-02 04:38:57 You don't understand the economy of your own country. Oil only makes a small portion of your GDP.

Mexico exports 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. That comes to about thirty-five billion a year at current prices. Mexico has a GDP of 1.046 trillion USD. Oil isn't close to 90%.
8929 2018-07-02 04:38:55 And coconut oil works wonders

8943 2018-07-02 04:36:03 Ask any European from Sweden, Finland to Germany. They are living it up in their social democracy! A % of Norway's oil profits goes to a national pension plan because the resources belong to every citizen not just corporations! How socialist is that?

8972 2018-07-02 04:29:23 I agree 100%!  I live in Seattle and they keep pushing more dams and KinderMorgan exploiting our already fragile waters and species.

8980 2018-07-02 04:27:40 This is just silly. So US soldiers had every right to invade Iraq, after all why should the Iraqis be allowed to control their territory/oil just because they happened to be born Iraqi?
8981 2018-07-02 04:27:38 #IranCollapsing economy is already leading to sporadic anti-government protests according to media reports. And should Trump succeed in convincing Saudi Arabia to boost oil production to 12mmb/d, the fallout for Iran would be even more dire.

8984 2018-07-02 04:26:49 Who is the protest against? Oil prices and the USDZAR aren’t determined by any SA institution. Perhaps citizens must end corruption, non-delivery of services including building infrastructure, which partly reduces SA appeal to capital flows and the Rand. As for oil price, tough.

9006 2018-07-02 04:22:58 Lies, China, Russia and Cuba already are trying to control out oil, the USA has never tried to control it and the PSUV destroyed PDVSA. This isn't a media tactic, if you want to insult us with this lies, then you don't know who are you defending.
9007 2018-07-02 04:22:49 He is absolutely correct.
You do not take in the oil (to your water) that multiplies, and also stays oil, and wonder why you cannot find any water.

They do not mix.  They are diametrically opposed.
Sorry, but that's how I see it.
It's the religion.  It doesn't currently fit.

9017 2018-07-02 04:20:12 I'm proud to announce that when I first encountered Donald Trump in 1980, I said to myself, "he's a clown, a sleazy snake oil salesman, I'll never pay attention to his bullshit as long as I live."  And that holds.

9019 2018-07-02 04:19:42 The only difference is that chavez had oil prices of 120$ and it was really hard for the damage to show with all the money the petrol made, but by misusing all those funds (aka stealing) the petrol company (pdvsa) is in shambles and all the lands he stole are destroyed

9034 2018-07-02 04:17:18 Trump says OPEC should stop manipulating the oil market (psst, it's a cartel) because we're protecting many of them. Obviously he's referring to Saudi, Qatar, and Kuwait, but not Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Rep. Congo, and Venezuela.

9046 2018-07-02 04:15:49 Whatever that is not the point.  And I am glad that you investigated.  I think that we can have a richer conversation when people know facts.  In this case México has to increase the non oil exports, which they can and have done in the past.

9051 2018-07-02 04:15:09 Trudeau clearly rates better than Trump but to become enamored of a leader can be dangerous.
He leads a relatively more progressive government but has still sold arms to Saudi Arabia and approved an oil pipeline through Indigenous land.

9147 2018-07-02 03:59:10 Went 9 months between oil changes in my CR-V. Just now hit 5% oil life. Crazy when you buy new Hondas they say they are "no maintenance"... That's not a lie.

9149 2018-07-02 03:58:51 The banking/financial & oil cartels R controlled by Britain& these financial entities control the U.S politicians. David Headley was FBI informant and deep state operator. Hindutva groups colluded with some of the NATO operators in mumbai attacks. WHo owns Genie energy?
9150 2018-07-02 03:58:41 Never trust a top muslim official from opec. Muslim oil barons want to get wealthy and manipulate world economies/governments as much as the supposed fake (satanic) jewish banks. They live so lavishly; caused wars for the US; and helped caused a racist muslim invasion of Europe

9154 2018-07-02 03:58:29 Driving home after dark and seeing all the flare stacks at the oil pads along 21 and 77 really is something else. It’s crazy how much the oilfield is kicking back up around here
9155 2018-07-02 03:58:28 When I was ten, I couldn’t decide on what my favorite cartoon was, much less my sexuality. Talk about indoctrination!

9162 2018-07-02 03:57:15 These are not investigators or agents,  these are Democrat Administrators with an agenda, very much like FBI Agent Peter Strzok. Politics and Law Enforcement are like oil and water. It breeds unethical behavior and is corrosive to the justice system!  It must be rooted out!
9163 2018-07-02 03:57:14 And that’s 20-24 brownies per batch? I’m an engineer, I can get the grinding and oil making done quickly with the correct tools...we can bake in 13x9 aluminum pans then recycle those into tin hats to protect us from Space Force interference.

9180 2018-07-02 03:54:52 Left as you mention are humanist. Thinking always to help others with Zero racism and ready to build bridges to unite different people around the planet. Hate lives on Republicans that only create war and separation. Like Bush destroyed Irak to take their oil.
9181 2018-07-02 03:54:48 Make Syria into another oil fiefdom. It's always about oil, gold, and the Petrodollar. Every nation we've attacked or undermined or want to, like Iran, has challenged the Petrodollar, but the MSM Lies it's about "human rights." Yet we support the Saudis, the Masters of Terrorism.
9182 2018-07-02 03:54:43 I have the easiest natural hair ever lol I only use one product on my hair. You should see how shocked other naturals are when I tell them I only use a curling cream and a bit of oil.

The market is the ultimate authority to decide when and if a gap should be filled. Some gaps may not be filled for a long time or forever. Fortunately, current bearish gap seems not to be such a case.

Well... an oil splatter hit the eye, I jumped, and narrowly avoided going down with pan, oil et al. Oh dear. Most Indian recipes I know tend to be a bit on the elaborate side... Gotta tone 'em down!
9206 2018-07-02 03:50:53 also i need you to know that i read oil
9207 2018-07-02 03:50:43 It’s “OIL BUSINESS” here. 
9208 2018-07-02 03:50:18 You have no idea what is really going on in Venezuela, do you? Their  government stole the private sector and destroyed it. Sold the oil and took the money and put them in thier pockets. They saved the oil money in US and other countries for themselves.
9209 2018-07-02 03:50:16 When I make my lo mein it’s a combo of regular & sweet soy sauces, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, hoisin sauce & stir fry sauce, plus some red pepper flakes & garlic powder.
9210 2018-07-02 03:50:06 I used olive oil instead of butter
9211 2018-07-02 03:50:03 BABIES WILL SINK UNTIL THEY GET REAL FEATHERS. Their is a gland at the base of their tail that when preening secrets an oil that water proofs them.
9212 2018-07-02 03:49:48 Read about the whale oil industry. It ruled 300 years & in less than 50 it was over. Extinct. It wasn't about saving whales. Getting oil in the ground was easier & cheaper. 

Just like the sun.
It's just a matter of time.
9213 2018-07-02 03:49:45 I wonder if this three star rating is going to hold once gas and oil companies are given drilling permits throughout Grand Staircase and Bears Ears? Not so sure people want to travel thousands of miles to have their beautiful, scenic view marred by oil rigs and leaks.

9216 2018-07-02 03:48:40 DWT is a derivative of wti oil 3 times levered inverse(short), meaning it goes up and down 3 times the price of wti oil price, u need to understand ETF decay (contango/backwardation.. google it) before trading it, this is highly volatile instrument.

9224 2018-07-02 03:47:09 I (weirdly) kinda enjoy the tingle of the gracilis subspecies of stinging #nettle (Urtica dioica), and even grow it in my garden.

But I took that blasé attitude when I recently met subspecies holosericea ("hoary nettle"), and I thought I'd dipped my fingers in hot oil.

9236 2018-07-02 03:44:46 Wasn't suggesting it would be a good idea now. Was implying that American foreign policy in the past was exploitative for cheap oil but operated under the guise of spreading "American democracy" because we have the best system or something

9246 2018-07-02 03:43:43 I don't know.  I told Alex that I disagreed w selling snake oil.

He and his parents snuck behind my back against my protest and formed the supplement business.

Alex used it to divert money from our estate and to turn our liquid assets into inventory.

Is that fraud, @fbi?

9271 2018-07-02 03:40:36 @sadeghZibakalam I saw you on the News makers. Why not have Iran issue currency backed by your oil reserves. Their should be an election so that the agreement is between the people of Iran and anyone willing to trade for oil currency. This would put more non fiat currency
9272 2018-07-02 03:40:12 I also saw that same union harass a teacher for using their lunch period to tutor a kid who couldn't meet at any other time. You know, the kind of thing you'd love to see in the teacher of your kid.

9275 2018-07-02 03:40:01 A 1.5¢ increase in tax cannot explain a 15¢ price variation at the pump in a single day. That's only 1% impact on the total price. We're getting robbed by oil companies, that's it.

9295 2018-07-02 03:36:48 So I take half a CBD gummy because it's enough for what I need.

9325 2018-07-02 03:33:28 Oil Hungry USA is trying  to control Venezuelan Oil much like Iraq no longer has national control of their Oil. Public support must be created and built first, hence the sudden rush of "Venezuelans" using the same social media tactics as the Trump election.

9360 2018-07-02 03:29:02 Venezuela has THE LARGEST Oil Reserves on the planet. There was a recent claim that "The USA Refineries cannot take the crude unless Venezuela cleans it". Total B.S. The same refineries took/take tar sands and shale oil, bitumen often remains in that pipeline feed.
9361 2018-07-02 03:29:02 After a phase of falling and staying stagnant, #FuelPrice may rise owing to the weaker #Rupee and stronger #oilprice. Crude oil prices have raised this year owing to high demand and artificial supply restrictions. #Newsfocus
9362 2018-07-02 03:28:52 End them.  Mexico does not need them.  Mexico lives 90% of oil and 10% of other exports  In fact México does not need remittances or NAFTA.

9449 2018-07-02 03:15:28 It's actually been educational. I learned about serious flaws in design, and a dev attitude that leads to sloppy rhetoric instead of fixes. Mendacious charlatanry and snake oil. Maybe you didn't want to teach that, but it came through loud and clear, tweet after tweet. Thanks!

9455 2018-07-02 03:15:02 Version 1: make a simple Alfredo sauce (literally butter, cream, parmesan and pepper), toss, eat, die and go to heaven.

Version 2: spritz or toss with olive oil, grill or roast broccoli in oven, toss broccoli in Annie's sesame dressing.

9461 2018-07-02 03:13:59 What's so refreshing about a socialist? Same snake oil, different salesperson? Anyone old enough to remember when Chavez came to power in Venezuela? He was described the same way.

As refreshing as a rotting corps.
9462 2018-07-02 03:13:26 Thanks! So much Trump bad stuff out there hadnt heard about the oil dumping.  But not surprised. He is like the rich spoiled kid acting out in every way imaginable. I followed the other two groups you mention. Was already following @oceana.

9466 2018-07-02 03:12:54 Enriching big oil more and more.  The tax scam that will end up raising taxes for the middle class/poor in 2020, and the rich will keep their tax cuts....  yeah, that’s the party I want to side with.  The two party system needs to end, but right now the dems are better choice.
9467 2018-07-02 03:12:43 Also changed the oil.. this time I didn’t over fill it ayy
9468 2018-07-02 03:12:35 Developed nations want to store more oil and natural gas so they may fight for regions of oil exploration and this may lead to world war. Spiritual awakening by self realized saint is necessary to teach people to live in limited resources.

9470 2018-07-02 03:12:34 It sounds like ppl in glass houses to me. The fastest path to reducing dependency on oil is to stop demanding it & we are all guilty of that.  We should absolutely be working towards 0 hydrocarbons, but that's a long way off - in the meantime, oilsands aren't worse than anywhere

Apply a mix of coconut oil, almond oil and castor oil on your brows every night before you go to bed. The mix will make your eyebrows grow within 2 weeks. If you don’t have any of these just use Vaseline it works just as well.

9558 2018-07-02 03:00:51 Art, during the early 2016 when the oil price hit the bottom, I remembered that many shale oil producers started to re neogotiate their transportation contracts with midstream pipeline companies - most long term contracts all became short term take and pay arrangements.

9564 2018-07-02 03:00:09 Venezuela is free to produce and sell its oil in the world market.only problem is that the destroyed oil industry is not even capable of producing its OPEP quota. The only outside factors affecting Venezuela is that no bank lends them money because they are already in default.

9610 2018-07-02 02:53:28 As for the impacts, the CIA ops & armed gangs of terrorists will chip away, but will be resisted successfully. Trump demanding no oil imports November onward will cause rial to plummet & budget revenues to spiral downwards. this is very dangerous & is an act of war
9611 2018-07-02 02:53:19 i don't do anything tbh. brown sugar & olive oil face scrub once a week & oil free moisturizer. i wear light makeup like twice a month now maybe, and it's helped a lot!
9612 2018-07-02 02:53:12 the job basically will just be running little parts through a machine, which i can do. it will smell like pure oil in there, be slippery and messy and hot. i CAN do it but damn im not really enthusiastic about doing it for 9 hours a day

9629 2018-07-02 02:51:09 Now slowly pipe the batter into the oil in a long, straight line. You can do a few at a time. Let fry on one side until browned. This could take anywhere from about 30-60 seconds. Flip over and fry on the other side until browned, then quickly remove to a plate.

9641 2018-07-02 02:49:42 暑すぎる……
9642 2018-07-02 02:49:39 Now add 1 inch of vegetable or canola oil to a large pot with high sides and heat the oil over medium-high heat. Check the oil after about 5 minutes. Drop a little batter in the oil to test. If it sizzles and starts to turn golden quickly, you know the oil is ready.
9643 2018-07-02 02:49:24 Before you cut it do a deep conditioning and hot oil treatment

9687 2018-07-02 02:43:23 Well.... Karena aku tidak suka dengan produk oil oil gitu. Me stay with mw :(
9688 2018-07-02 02:43:20 For me, that entirely depends on the price of oil  (I dread my July electric bill though).
9689 2018-07-02 02:43:05 Listen I puts that lavender oil in the aromatherapy machine and the whole house be out
9690 2018-07-02 02:43:02 No he won’t — Putin wants higher oil prices so Trump has to deliver them
9691 2018-07-02 02:42:29 July is always my month

9694 2018-07-02 02:42:01 Esse aê tenta reescrever a história. Pífio !!
9695 2018-07-02 02:41:52 You should drive to the any gas station, and probably what should be good is just get oil and burn everything down.  There is the reason of the sun disappearance, and it's probably because they don't like light. BUT...  On the gas station you can get anything, like water, or food
9696 2018-07-02 02:41:51 Correct. The last time they cranked up production was to break the US oil industry 2 years ago.  To their detriment. Can't see them doing that again.
9697 2018-07-02 02:41:40 Sushi
9698 2018-07-02 02:41:35 OIL crisis reality to be hit soon...!!! 
Renewable & Nuclear energy have to be implemented well in advance to avoid chaos.
9699 2018-07-02 02:41:27 Another reason why oil is a dead short here is because Trump will do whatever it takes to being it down into the midterms.
9700 2018-07-02 02:40:52 @Starkaane happy birthday olive oil
9701 2018-07-02 02:40:50 this just gets better. oil and water dont mix.

9703 2018-07-02 02:40:37 Moist and hydrated. Been using aloe Vera cleansing wipes by @naturerepublica as an alternative to using a traditional cleanser to keep oil production at bay during the summer (i’m combo/oily), beauty water by @sonandpark for hydration and @glossier invisible shield (spf).

9707 2018-07-02 02:39:51 Sending wishes across the pond for a good sleep. I have sleep issues, too. Am now on cannabis oil, which has been life altering for me. I hope you can get to a good, restorative sleep. Sweet dreams. 
9708 2018-07-02 02:39:45 The food and the oil in the fryer my goodness
9709 2018-07-02 02:39:29 Oil will be part of GST but don't expect fall in prices. Also GST is not designed to reduce taxes. It is for simplicity of business and a way so that all businesses pay taxes. Once compliance becomes higher, taxes may be reduced for some products. Before GST too, taxes were high.
9710 2018-07-02 02:39:21 Reserve currency. Oil priced in US$. Only reason it's still able to prosper with $20 trillion debt. Only country that can keep printing $$$ with no consequences. P
9711 2018-07-02 02:39:08 Developed nations want to store more oil and natural gas so they may fight for regions of oil exploration and this may lead to world war. Spiritual awakening by self realized saint is necessary to teach people to live in limited resources.

9712 2018-07-02 02:39:06 My weekend research indicated that you divide it between a series of small containers, cover it with olive oil, and put it in the freezer for up to 4 months. (I used a 2.5kg can of chickpeas. :) )
9713 2018-07-02 02:39:02 Just sharing some photos from yesterday’s rugby league action at the Oil Search National Football Stadium, Port Moresby between the ISC Queensland Cup reigning premiers SP PNG Hunters and Sunshine Falcons. Hunters won 24-12. 

Feel free to share.
9714 2018-07-02 02:38:50 ND are fighting and protecting their rights what is herdsmen fighting for? Go to ND today see what oil does to their land and ask yourself assuming its in ur own land where u can not plant nor harvest and govt are place to their intelligence. If u re d owner,wat will u do?
9715 2018-07-02 02:38:46 Oil 

Humm
9716 2018-07-02 02:38:41 i can’t stop drinkin this oil if i wanted to
9717 2018-07-02 02:38:39 Oh yay! I thought it was an oil so I mixed it in with my DE Framboos - whoops. It’s kinda like an oil serum?
9718 2018-07-02 02:38:37 How do the oil sanctions on Iran affect Russia?
9719 2018-07-02 02:38:23 i just bought coconut oil i feel like a changed person

9721 2018-07-02 02:37:23 As a Pittsburgh native, I’m ashamed that I don’t eat them more often. But found that baking them makes them sooooo much better. Nice crisp without all the oil
9722 2018-07-02 02:37:17 Not sure we need Merrick Garland in there. The 6-foot oil painting over the fireplace should suffice.
9723 2018-07-02 02:37:17 Dear Lopez Orbrador, I hope you call for exodus away from Nazi petrol dollar by inviting all who wish to build the new circular economy micro grid revolution. @OTEcorporation will be your new oil. Just call for migrations to the sea with permaculture and watch community prosper.
9724 2018-07-02 02:37:09 my car "will definitely be ready in the morning" for the past two days. i needed an oil change and a flush. on friday. i hate black business lol
9725 2018-07-02 02:37:02 The G6 economy is bigger than the US. Canada is mostly self sufficient. Plenty of oil, more fresh water than anyone, we make American cars here, forest products (lumber). What we need we can buy from Europe, China, Russia. The US needs our raw materials such as lumber, steel etc.
9726 2018-07-02 02:36:57 Yeah! You know what they should do? Nationalize their oil compan...oh crap...OH I KNOW! Lets devalue the Peso and...oh...Sorry....LETS MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO BE POOR! WHY HASNT ANYONE EVER THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE!
9727 2018-07-02 02:36:44 I’m buying you blot paper and an oil control primer.
9728 2018-07-02 02:36:44 AMLO wants to bigly increase social welfare spending. Also to reverse privatization, even though he says he won't nationalize anything. Concern re a bunch of big oil deal Pena Neta made, and that AMLO may cut them. And AMLO has said he'll release a whole bunch of drug prisoners.
9729 2018-07-02 02:36:43 Vitamin E oil or bio oil works!!!
9730 2018-07-02 02:36:41 ...lot on oil. And while yes I am pretty against the privatization of oil. Making oil the Golden Cow it once was is backwards looking and will keep Mexico from really developing. 

Add to that his kind of early campaign start skirting around the law by being coy about being named
9731 2018-07-02 02:36:36 Oil and gas in Alberta was publicly funded/founded, and is still heavily subsidized.

9734 2018-07-02 02:36:07 Get out of retirement and put some coconut oil on them knees.
9735 2018-07-02 02:35:43 Government should enforce the traffic rules Strictly. We can reduce a hefty amount of Oil Import just by managing traffic, besides drastic improvement in Health, Mental Peace , Pollution Control etc.etc. @nitin_gadkari
9736 2018-07-02 02:35:30 I’ll take Gardiner and Reilly over any plug in the oil any day. Plus we have an actual goalie.
9737 2018-07-02 02:35:28 absolute nonsense.fiscal consolidation has progressed. Rupee will continue to weaker till we are dependent on oil & foreign flows. this rupee weakening is a blessing in disguise
9738 2018-07-02 02:35:05 me, describing the sugar scrub I made: it's just brown sugar, olive oil, honey, grapefr-

9741 2018-07-02 02:34:43 Obama didn't do anything to our oil industry. Malevolent ignorance isn't a good look. Maybe you should try getting an education about how the oil market works instead of blaming the black guy for the way market forces operate?
9742 2018-07-02 02:34:26 Lazy way of saying olive oil.
9743 2018-07-02 02:34:20 me for this past hour: hahaha tiffinny

9745 2018-07-02 02:34:12 Ok so. I realize it's 2018 and I just purchased my first "vat" of coconut oil, and Twitter I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you sooner.
9746 2018-07-02 02:34:06 starting to cook with coconut oil instead of olive oil has been the best thing ever. coconut oil is soooooo dope
9747 2018-07-02 02:34:06 Clove oil will help my love.
9748 2018-07-02 02:34:00 Bukan ga boleh, lebih ke kurang efektif, semacam dibanding cream/oil dia ngebersihinnya kalah gitu dan katanya juga ga bagus kalo dipake lama-lama, soalnya kan mw awalnya di desain buat emergency, pengganti air. Skincare guru pada ga rekomen kalo first cleansernya mw -ns
9749 2018-07-02 02:34:00 How do you walk out of WalMart with Nothing... I've gone in for a Quart of Oil and left with a $100 receipt, and forgotten the Oil... More than Once.

9770 2018-07-02 02:30:24 Oily! I have tretenoin gel on my face rn but still very oily. After cleansing at night I use toner then tretenoin gel. Is my body producing more oil because I don’t have a moisturizer on rn? I’ve always had oily skin though.

9780 2018-07-02 02:29:00 "Some nosy boomer bitch is calling the condo association on people who vaccum out their cars" = "Time for me to change my differential oil at 10 PM"

He depends onto the Oil nations of  the Gulf, Russian banks Oligarchs,  China.

9785 2018-07-02 02:27:52 The most blatantly obvious false flag in history. The objective was to fill the already massive wallets of the elite, through taking oil and numerous other resources. Also serving as fear propaganda for the masses. Poorly executed by bad actors.
9786 2018-07-02 02:27:52 Republican idea: we’re going to increase military spending, oil subsidies, tax cuts for the rich, and subsidize Walmart low wages 

Media: that all sounds like it will pay for itself. Huzzah to you, good sirs

9793 2018-07-02 02:26:48 I laugh because I have been there. Also half a bottle of olive oil 
9794 2018-07-02 02:26:47 The economy stays steady 
 mostly because of remittances from people in the US and a nationalized oil industry.
9795 2018-07-02 02:26:28 Yep Yep! Im a traditional oil painter
9796 2018-07-02 02:26:18 This is a great list. Excited to read the essay. Something I wonder about quite a bit about universal income is how it works with immigration. E.g. one of the reasons Saudi Arabia is so restrictive with it's citizenship is the distribution of oil wealth.
9797 2018-07-02 02:26:08 oh uhh i’m trying to get like. an oil cartridge for my vape pen cuz it’s better than buying a bunch of edibles lmao even though the dude i’m trying to buy from is a Dick

9800 2018-07-02 02:25:53 Japan bought more than four million barrels of US crude due to it becoming cheaper than their usual supply from Iran, as well as concerns about Trump administration sanctions against nations that continue to purchase Iranian oil. (Staff) #Japan #Iran #IranSanctions #Oil #CrudeOil
9801 2018-07-02 02:25:50 And Canadian gas and oil, not to mention routing the Alaskan oil production so it doesn't go through Canada is really expensive which could impact the price of oil inside the U.S. if Canada ever decides to fuck with the U.S. in that respect.

9808 2018-07-02 02:25:22 I need a cleansing so tea tree and clary sage essential oil in the diffuser.
9809 2018-07-02 02:25:22 I just got looked at weird the other day cuz I haven’t had an oil change since January 
9810 2018-07-02 02:24:59 I think they would bring more oil if they had any imagination that He’d come later. I think this suggests either that they believe He’s coming earlier, or that they’re apathetically ignorant.
9811 2018-07-02 02:24:44 In the baby oil aisle
9812 2018-07-02 02:24:31 Thanks bro
9813 2018-07-02 02:24:29 If-then-else - Hey Big Oil
9814 2018-07-02 02:24:10 My baby’s cloth wipe spray for today i put in a 2 drops of frankincense and 2 drops of patchouli and this child smells so good. I introduce a small amount of a different mild essential oil to her each week through her cloth wipe spray
9815 2018-07-02 02:24:04 Girl I need to start doing that  something I like doing too is lathering my hands in castor oil and putting on gloves before I go to sleep. My skin absorbs it and it makes a huge difference. I just need to be consistent lol!
9816 2018-07-02 02:23:52 Wow. And we talk of our own currency in a deprecating manner. Except for the oil currencies, every where else it held its ground.

9819 2018-07-02 02:23:29 Yang tu cleansing oil mainly for hydration. It’s good nak banding dengan biore and nutox yang i pernah pakai. Tak pedih mata and tak keringkan kulit sangat. Makeup semua tanggal pun 
9820 2018-07-02 02:23:27 Got my stuff delivere howeevr the bed side table that i had ordered for when delivered had oil fallen and was extremely greasy.. i didnt accept that and returned immediately. I have already paid for that. So please send me another piece.
9821 2018-07-02 02:23:19 You’re welcome! A little oil goes a long way too. I remember when i first used oil .. they were like oil soaked sponges lmao

9833 2018-07-02 02:21:51 I have facts that it creates poverty and tyranny. Venezuela was a wealthy country sitting on one of the worlds largest oil reserves. They voted in a socialist (Chavez) who stole billions. He died and his daughter is worth 36 billion dollars. No food on shelves, people hurting.
9834 2018-07-02 02:21:39 Hoping for the best from AMLO. The defeated political parties corruption for 70 years turned Mexico into the third world. A country so rich in oil, natural resources, agriculture and tourism. Mexico should had been a powerhouse first world country instead.

9836 2018-07-02 02:21:35 It's about control of the supply and who controls it for the world market. Look at Libya and Iraq who controls their oil? Who profits from it? Iran will be destroyed by the US and the Saudis as they " liberate" them as they did Iraq, Libya and Syria.

9956 2018-07-02 02:01:55 Just scrubbed my kitchen floor on my hands and knees with an organic, essential oil mixture - I feel like a 40 year old soccer mom.
9957 2018-07-02 02:01:46 Kajol gives a damn on anyone they need her to boost their cast list, Rani is the one who needs big stars thats why she goes to every Karan parties, SRK party, Aamir party to oil them, even Sonam is bigger than her now so she went to her shadi to held thali.

9962 2018-07-02 02:01:00 coconut oil fixes everything

9966 2018-07-02 02:00:15 Yo i walked outside and saw the oil stain i left, im just glad i made it there and back okay
9967 2018-07-02 02:00:02 @Mac_Fischer -There’s something wrong with me car, I have to get an oil change every 3000 miles!?
@zachcowan14 - ... you’re supposed to every 3000 miles...


9968 2018-07-02 01:59:50 Can all the bandwagon fans atleast use a coupon for an oil change #ijs#lol#Lakers
9969 2018-07-02 01:59:48 In joy's domestic flame

and bitter anguish, oil.

Skin sweet with musky oil"
9971 2018-07-02 01:59:31 The Iranian government is so involved in spending their oil money, thanks to the previous administrations release of $1.7 bil for oil infrastructure, that their people have the same standard of living they've always had thanks to United States sanctions
9972 2018-07-02 01:59:23 He’s just shooting a gun all over this oil rig and NOBODY CARES ????
9973 2018-07-02 01:59:16 This is not true. Omega 3 from plants is not usable by the body. The body has to convert it to usable form, which is an extremely inefficient process, yielding maybe 50% of the fat. Fish oil is already in the right form.
9974 2018-07-02 01:59:10 Yes they are phenomenal dogs Bugsy has never chewed anything up she’s never partied in the house she’s never dug a hole but they are so afraid of their own shadow sometimes so you got to take the good with the bad and the cannabis oil that’s an idea  thank you!
9975 2018-07-02 01:58:43 Oily. That’s normal at the end of the day for me tho lmao. You put me on to the neutrogena hyaluronic acid line and that’s helped with oil production, but I’m currently looking for a chemical exfoliator still 
9976 2018-07-02 01:58:39 Trump is manipulating the stock market so his corporate friends can make money. He now wants break OPEC unity. I believed in Trump but now oil and more trade wars. The U.S. economy is starting to reverse to a bad economy again
9977 2018-07-02 01:58:28 Stay safe people. DO NOT give your money to ANYONE you meet in online #Trading in exchange for trades or education or whatever. Don't put money where they tell you to. You don't want to get caught up in scams #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #ES_F #Forex #DXY
9978 2018-07-02 01:58:26 A hot oil body massage from head to toe 
9979 2018-07-02 01:58:06 Yup, he’s nuts AND a blatant liar. Has been since I knew anything about him in NYC. Snake oil salesman.
9980 2018-07-02 01:58:03 
9981 2018-07-02 01:58:02 Ladies, if you had a sick child and you could choose a tablet or cannabis oil to treat the illness what would you chose and why?
9982 2018-07-02 01:57:51 Discovered last night that Gus the wonder dog, who shakes so hard at fireworks that he almost comes apart, is not upset by them if he has a squirt of hemp oil on his food.  I have been doing this 2x/day for awhile for other reasons.  This is amazing.
9983 2018-07-02 01:57:49 He’s a very narcissistic snake oil salesman. He tells his biggest lies at his cult rallies. Does he ever say a prayer at his hate rallies? Not that I’ve seen. You know before he asks his followers to hate “the enemy of the people” (our free press) with him.
9984 2018-07-02 01:57:44 My name is Rob and I would do awful things for some good Italian bread and olive oil no matter how full I am
9985 2018-07-02 01:57:28 i let oil pop on me bc i’m bout that life
9986 2018-07-02 01:57:18 I think they would need side stream processing from their fusel oil separator and that may not be a fully explored concept. Armagnac seems to do a great job of rocking the cont. still.
9987 2018-07-02 01:57:00 So much oil for looteras of India. Perhaps you may not pay any bills or u have easy money
9988 2018-07-02 01:56:46 Jamaican castor oil is life 
9989 2018-07-02 01:56:33 I use the LCO. I went to a natural hair consultant and she told me with my type of hair I needed to seal everything in with the oil at the end.
9990 2018-07-02 01:56:28 Worse news for Mexico when they eventually realize that a left leaning socialist will only make things worse for them....the spending will be out of control and they don’t have the oil to subsidize that they once enjoyed...
9991 2018-07-02 01:56:24 Big shout out to @kaylewisniewski for loading me up with oil earlier.. I’m fucking BURNT... good looks homie.
9992 2018-07-02 01:56:20 that's one reason I'm not on twitter as much. needed a break from this perpetual, depressing scam Dem party plays on voters & how they eat it up, remain apathetic to this soft right donor/big oil/pharma war party while claiming to be "against Trump", definitely against us. CULT!
9993 2018-07-02 01:56:09 We knew that from the beginning when B.P. was putting out their usual false facts about how much has leaked, paying millions to a firm that shines up your Public face,and all that  boom that worked so well keeping oil off all the living creatures,what a responsible corporation
9994 2018-07-02 01:56:00 forgot my oil....shuda gone back for it
9995 2018-07-02 01:55:29 i need twitter headers, avatars, facebook headers, posters, print out tattoos, oil works

9998 2018-07-02 01:55:21 My head got sensitive to a lot of things so I had to stop oils for a few months. Trying to get back on castor oil again now

10000 2018-07-02 01:55:12 canibis oil is a good idea!! Too the shirt didn’t work. My brother had a collie years ago and she was so afraid! They had to put her indoors or she would run! Poor baby.
10001 2018-07-02 01:55:06 マスハラで捕まってそうな人
10002 2018-07-02 01:54:54 thin sirloin tip steak in low heat with little olive oil, salt & freshly crushed peppercorn, lemon juice & my fav little A1 sauce..smelling delicious..now what else on top or side dish
10003 2018-07-02 01:54:39 Thank you!! Ive never tried that before. I’ve used tea tree oil before but the combo oil I have has it in it so I’ll continue to use that.
10004 2018-07-02 01:54:39 The product I like is the curl defining creme. And I use the LOC method (leave in. Oil, creme)
10005 2018-07-02 01:54:21 You may want to check to see who your second biggest supplier of oil is...while your at it check natural resources and electricity.
10006 2018-07-02 01:54:12 Ford appeases big oil and supports the military industrial complex im amazed at what Tesla has accomplished in the free market! Oh taxation is theft.
10007 2018-07-02 01:54:06 Pour seven pounds of olive oil and set aside.
10008 2018-07-02 01:54:03 We can get closer to that goal by reducing our use of oil, as well.
10009 2018-07-02 01:53:58 My dog got more color than me... i hada put sunscreen on her... meanwhile im puttung oil on so i fry n ... nothing. 
10010 2018-07-02 01:53:38 He wasn't going to be a 1C with Colorado and MacKinnon around.
10011 2018-07-02 01:53:38 Ty pursued by the sunny (oil on canvas)
10012 2018-07-02 01:53:34 Glad you got to see them before they're all sold of to greedy rich guys for oil, mineral, and grazing rights. 

"Destroy our nation, just protect my racism.  MAGA."
10013 2018-07-02 01:53:33 Venezuela at the time had large amounts of foreign investments also, Venezuela was ranked number one with oil reserves in 2015, we used to fabricate cars here also, sadly i was to young to know anything of vzla of the past. but one can find it online, if you want i can send you
10014 2018-07-02 01:53:29 Is there a hidden strategy for the same (#Liberal) government to sell - give away for FREE - its position in an innovative aerospace project (Bombardier C-Series) to a foreign company (Airbus) and then BUY an option to build an oil pipeline for $4BILLION. Anyone knows? #cdnpoli
10015 2018-07-02 01:53:22 Or coconut oil
10016 2018-07-02 01:53:11 Can't believe I didn't think of this.  Brilliant.  Ok.. then I have dibs on Smithsonian Oil Paintings of the founding fathers.
10017 2018-07-02 01:52:55 As long as there are snake oil salesmen trying to get rich off the hype with ‘blockchain’ and ICOs, I’m fine with the attacks. They are as good as central banks - scammers. They need to be fought too. We are trying to build a better system. So zero tolerance with their BS.
