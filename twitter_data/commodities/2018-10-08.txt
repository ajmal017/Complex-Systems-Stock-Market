The rich won't pay; their cash is safely stashed elsewhere!
1 2018-10-08 23:50:48 All we need is the commodities, while we at that remember clean running water, working sewage system and pharmaceutical drugs as those things are scarce too
2 2018-10-08 23:50:43 Mano qual crise, pq vivemos uma política e uma econômica e ambas não foram culpa única e exclusivamente do PT, aliás o PT tomou umas decisões erradas sim, mas a culpa da merda toda ou é da baixa nos preços de commodities, ou da direita q não aceitou perder a última eleição.

5 2018-10-08 23:45:16 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
6 2018-10-08 23:38:42 Só que eles acham que o PT vai virar uma Venezuela. E na vdd o governo do PT com populismo + commodities é mt parecido msm. A gente n se afundou de vez pq n dependemos só do petróleo como eles. O único argumento q consigo dar é que o conservadorismo vai ser uma merda.
7 2018-10-08 23:29:29 Cara, eles nao sabem o que sao commodities, tripe macroeconômico, plano rea, so sabem "o primeiro governo lula foi bom"
8 2018-10-08 23:28:43 The EPA is holding back because ethanol only makes sense as an energy investment if you are a corn farmer or invested in corn commodities. As renewables become more efficient and less expensive ethanol will become even less desirable. 

Beware.

This is a special interest ad.
9 2018-10-08 23:28:33 It is messed how people would rather be racist than sexist. Both are equally bad. People, like Kirk and many other Trump supporters, think that black people are still their property, not as slaves but more as political commodities.
10 2018-10-08 23:13:00 The microbiome is new science, people are only just finding out about it, and only just finding out how amazing breast milk is.

But - capitalism is succeeding in making us think out own bodies are commodities, not important. Something that can be easily chopped up & thrown away.
11 2018-10-08 22:50:26 O Lula ganhou na loteria por governar quando o preço das commodities estavam alto, ele não fez nenhum milagre econômico, inclusive não soube aproveitar bem essa janela que o destino nos deu, mensalão e petrolão que nos diga!

14 2018-10-08 22:39:18 I read it as we are now able to export commodities instead of having to buy them. (Trade surplus, not deficit.) What am I missing?
15 2018-10-08 22:30:31 Your belief that "printing" money causes hyperinflation & that pegging currency to commodities condones overspending only proves your own macroeconomic ignorance. S'OK, 5 decades of Neoliberal propaganda will do that.
16 2018-10-08 22:29:03 i'll agree wit u if by makin decent livin u mean becomin sell-outs being bought off lyk cash commodities, the only job wil be joining the 'atiku boiz', wealth creation? i c it more as destruction, as for a blessed 9ja i doubt that, 9ja wil just be 'atikulated' to a cursed state.
17 2018-10-08 22:28:08 Can you please list the major commodities being exported those times ? Also when was the last payment received as war on terror aid which leads me to Mush era, that fake economic bubble for almost 8 years led to disaster, 80 percent of cabinet is of that era
18 2018-10-08 22:18:20 7 rotation players are back for a Florida State team that was one win away from the Final Four. Phil Cofer and Terance Mann are known commodities in the ACC, but if the Noles want to make it to Minneapolis it might depend on the growth of sophomore Mfiondu Kabengele. #CBBPreview
19 2018-10-08 22:16:26 Now that you've said it, now is the right time to invest in commodities
