47 2018-09-20 21:59:46 Kindly advise us where we can go and purchase these commodities. The heart is willing (or is it the flesh); but those commodities come at a premium. On a serious note all those things can be learnt with effort. Thank you for the advice.
48 2018-09-20 21:52:03 First of all, you said to assume inflation, so that's what I'm doing. No policy I propose is inflationary.

Second, If you sell $100B of commodities, you do not get paid in paper money. You get credits to your bank account. Good luck withdrawing that to paper money, too.

51 2018-09-20 21:36:39 You didn't answer the question. The people who hold dollars from selling commodities: what do they do with the dollars? If they sell $100 Billion of commodities, what are they going to do with the dollars they receive? Where is a safer place to put $100B: a bank, or a Treasury?
52 2018-09-20 21:31:14 Commodities with their now debased dollars as they lost confidence in the currency.
53 2018-09-20 21:28:57 Back up. You said investors would use their dollars to buy commodities instead of Treasuries. To which I reply: now different people have the dollars, they didn't disappear. Now THOSE people have to figure out what to do with the dollars: banks, or Treasuries?

91 2018-09-20 19:12:53 Se eles tivessem feito uma analise séria perceberiam que o crescimento que o BR demonstrava ter não passava de "fogo de palha", pois ele se deu simplesmente pela valorização das commodities e com a facilitação exagerada de credito (que foi o motivo da crise mos EUA em 2008).

98 2018-09-20 18:30:42 This is true. But our govt find some other way. Debating on it is not a solution. We shouldn't follow the congress policy like many other policy and deals. Adjust with luxury commodities, reduce tax in bjp States till normalcy.

Most folks respond that other commodities (like wheat) have “inherent value” which $BTC lacks. This is a misconception.

Crypto assets are fundamentally pipelines for transmitting value. Just as you can price space in a pipeline for transmitting oil - you can price $BTC.
112 2018-09-20 17:46:48 Income producing assets are valued. Commodities like $BTC and wheat are priced. Prices depend on supply and demand. Are wheat and pork bellies pyramid schemes because they produce no income? No. But the investment approach will be different than investing in debt or equity. /1
113 2018-09-20 17:46:46 Come on!  The PR government is corrupt and put a blockade or stole a large amount of commodities going to the PR people. The US has been trying to help but the aid can’t get to those who need it because of local interference. #FactsMatter

Rather, it is a public trust, as our TX Constitution ensures.That means ALL children receive a quality education regardless of special need, race and class.

123 2018-09-20 17:24:16 No fundamental reason for any price. All prices possible. Depends 100% on whims of traders. At least with other commodities, the price can be tied to something like interest rates, currency, commercial use, etc. Not sure why anyone would trade #bitcoin
124 2018-09-20 17:10:49 High fuel prices impact cost of all commodities and impact the poor the most. The rich are the least affected by a couple of thousand rupees a month, it's loose change for them. Isn't it? Call it economics or call it common sense - why you can't understand this simple thing?
125 2018-09-20 16:59:00 Price gouging per Wikipedia-“...when a seller spikes the prices of goods, services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair, and is considered exploitative...” charging $300 for an empty seat on a plane that is flying regardless? unreasonable.

136 2018-09-20 16:07:03 Agreed, thinking about scenarios and horizons when commodities/currencies can protect portfolio value.  The problem is acting as if only relative matters -- as an investor, you can't eat only volatility, historical return data and covariance (although the manager can, when paid).

140 2018-09-20 15:58:36 Finally someone brings up Chinese holdings of US GOVERNMENT BONDS/DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

154 2018-09-20 15:17:30 Tava não. A economia bombou no primeiro mandato dele. A capa é de 2009. Em 2009 teve um semestre de recessão por conta da crise de 2008, com recuperação no segundo semestre. Cenário bem diferente do primeiro mandato com o boom das commodities.
155 2018-09-20 15:10:14 I look at Butler as a high end piece to compliment DeMar&Aldridge. I don’t follow college ball, so I have no clue as to who is out there. I watch a lot of draft shows & highlights come draft time. Sometimes proven commodities are better than potential. That’s all I’m saying.
156 2018-09-20 14:59:47 You could be right.  OTOH why should Gold be so inversely tied to SP?.  It is not just money.  It is a commodity in its own right & commodities as an asset class are booming inline with other assets.  Fact is Gold would be much higher than it is but for BitCoins.

183 2018-09-20 13:46:57 Absolutely.

Products / services or hybrid?

If products, is it commodities / raw materials, components or finished products?

Why do you struggle to understand the inflationary impacts of WTO tariffs on any of these?

194 2018-09-20 13:14:56 (4) While in commodities extension of wave 5 is common, wave 3 cannot be the shortest. Thus, I drew conclusion that the only possibility is that wave 5 is yet to be completed. The current correction is perfect for that as ending diagonal is always a start of new impulse wave.

231 2018-09-20 10:59:00 Having the UK’s own central bank has been disastrous. And the £ is a non-currency. Its only reason to exist is for bankers to make money by adding a stage in Forex. Which adds instability to world currency. Commodities are traded in $,€,¥.
232 2018-09-20 10:57:43 O lado golpista do Itamaraty - capitaneado por Sérgio Amaral - apóia o Brasil como fornecedor de commodities para sustentar os USA nesta guerra híbrida cona China e Rússia. Pragmatismo chinês: abocanhou parte da Eletrobrás. Certo?
233 2018-09-20 10:42:06 Not in this but watching from the outside. I’m looking to enter when the stale money sells. It looks like people are losing patience. USD strength is crushing commodities but if Trump gets his arse handed to him in November that trend could reverse quickly #HZM
234 2018-09-20 10:39:18 This is sad!!!! How nany unsuspecting motorists pumped water into their engines? How many engines were damaged? How may motorists are counting losses? The truck drivers did not notice a change in mass due to the difference in density for the 2 different commodities?
235 2018-09-20 10:20:12 Tell me this is parody. Nigel Farage is one of British politics' biggest liars. And I fail to see how commodities trading equates to "labour on a building site", or how being a solicitor is any more "real" than trading in commodities.
236 2018-09-20 10:10:09 While not yet commercially used in the industry, man-made ‘super mineral’ graphene holds huge potential for batteries. Derived from graphite, both commodities are expected to see huge growth in the coming years. What lies ahead for these minerals?

240 2018-09-20 10:00:54 I'm concerned about our heading in this country. I'm a trucker. Freight is better than it has been in a while. Our debt is & should be a major concern. They need to cut spending & increase our commodities. We need to pay off our debt.
241 2018-09-20 09:55:56 Nigel Farage had a proper job & worked in the real world of Commodities for many years before politics & I might add he has never been caught out on a lie, not like others and that upsets people - I laugh because of the naivety of others trying to trip him up - Truth hurts
242 2018-09-20 09:53:20 Chinese conglomerate Fosun International ltd. is in discussion to purchase British-based commodities broker Marex Spectron, aiming to expand the portfolio in both financial services and commodities
243 2018-09-20 09:48:30 That's the effect of an escalating trade war with no apparent specific goal. It also highlights what would likely happen to commodities if a resolution was found.

249 2018-09-20 09:39:10 Even in financial investments , such as futures,commodities,forex , etc  that used to be dominated by banks,retail investors are also now  participating due advances in ICT. Cryptocurrencies is also a real threat to today's banking model.
250 2018-09-20 09:36:38 In a country where most commodities are imports, except for FMCGs, the govt knows there's no way we can avoid paying VAT.

253 2018-09-20 09:21:24 Had #Macquarie been included in the first-half ranking, it would probably have shared the top spot with Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, meaning their net revenue from commodities was within 10 percent of one another,
254 2018-09-20 09:20:47 Coalition ranked Goldman, Morgan Stanley and #JPMorgan as joint top in commodities revenues in the first half of the year. Citigroup Inc., which last year was third in the ranking, dropped out of the top three
255 2018-09-20 09:19:54 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. regained its top spot in commodities in the first half of 2018, but had to share that position with rivals Morgan Stanley and #JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to research group Coalition Development Ltd.
256 2018-09-20 09:13:08 Traditionally, it's a way of making scarce, expensive commodities go further. (I'm sure there's some sort of analogy with Australian politics here...)

262 2018-09-20 08:53:53 But the main issue with Puerto Rico  was distribution.

FEMA places commodities in pre-determined staging areas where the state takes ownership and full possession of the emergency supplies. Local gov then decides how and where to distribute supplies to survivors.
263 2018-09-20 08:44:25 Those with presidential ambitions this is the time to rebrand and make kenyans feel that you stand for something. Take this big gamble and rally your troops to shut down this 8% VAT tax on fuel, to ensure that the basic commodities are not taxed #TaxVoteKe #CommonScamsIKnow

341 2018-09-20 02:02:46 The "cultural" critique of capitalism seems so backwards to me. Capitalism is really good with commodities, which leads to a lot of commodification, because "when all you have is a hammer..."

But the conclusion to "when all you have is a hammer" was never "Ban hammers"
342 2018-09-20 01:43:10 I've done polyamory on and off for seven years. I have multiple partners.  I fully believe love and sex are not limited commodities.

So why does my stomach drop when I find out my potential date for this weekend has another date before me? 
343 2018-09-20 01:32:37 Impressive H and S chart. I'd give 600 a likely target. I will look at this chart tomorrow. How did soy do today? Do you trade all the soybean commodities?
344 2018-09-20 01:26:51 At core it’s because many are commodities themselves.
345 2018-09-20 01:23:39 As long as sentient beings are viewed as commodities, this will continue to happen.  The solution is simple: stop factory farming by consuming far less animal products, or by cutting them out of your diet completely.  It's not that hard... I haven't eaten flesh for 21 years

347 2018-09-20 01:16:17 Mas mahal pa yung mga commodities. Immuned sa inflation? 
348 2018-09-20 01:14:06 This is a global disease...it’s more about breeding & trading than developing a racehorse...I’m so disillusioned with the new breed of “investors”...horses are just commodities these days...to be traded away..and these people are ruining our industry
349 2018-09-20 01:12:13 "there is a massive over investment, a kind of personal investment, in the cultural products, and the commodities, that we enjoy consuming. and you can see this across all different cultural and political levels"

354 2018-09-20 00:38:11 The main reason Puerto Rico's disaster assistance was a failure is because the local truck drivers wouldn't work until they were paid upfront.
Commodities were stacked in the dock and just sat there. And very sparse cooperation between local govt officials. Did you see the water?

357 2018-09-20 00:12:43 Heard statements coming from highly educated person about rising prices in the PH’s basic commodities. For her, flour causes the increasing prices of all imported goods. No wonder many individuals really don’t understand what’s happening now.
358 2018-09-20 00:08:00 Sorry for the philosophical but
We are a species that will discriminate over skin color, fight over commodities and kill over boundaries 
Is that really worth saving?
We have priests saving souls while penetrating children’s anuses
