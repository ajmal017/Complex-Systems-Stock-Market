6 2018-06-13 23:15:48 Initiate a zero barrier trade policy between all Provinces. Change any subsidies paid for commodities into subsidized trade infrastructure so manufacturers can get their products to markets faster and cheaper. Same with the US. Stop electing people that spend all the money.

2. It treats children like commodities

3. It creates children who they know will be destroyed

Etc etc etc
11 2018-06-13 22:40:17 I wouldn’t... but from what I understand, Scotland is a big commodities producer and it doesn’t appear you have equal representation or a fair share of the profits you produce.
12 2018-06-13 22:33:27 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
13 2018-06-13 22:33:16 With so many companies taking responsibility for the treatment of their female workers and commodities, what ever happen to @KeshaRose ‘s rapey producer at @SonyMusicGlobal ? #Metoomovement
14 2018-06-13 22:11:05 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food
15 2018-06-13 22:09:47 You will shortly see prices rise for most of your commodities. The rupee will touch 130 in the near term and over 150 in the longterm
16 2018-06-13 22:05:16 Among commodities, WTI crude marks third straight gain and 2wk high at 66.62.  Gold remained tightly range-bound just north of 2018 lows at 1296.
17 2018-06-13 21:58:09 So lending rates are going up... where is the raise in pay to meet inflation of real estate and commodities? Doesn't anyone realize that, by paying workers more, they spend more!? Simple solutions. Galvanize the workforce. Otherwise we're stuck with this welfare state.
18 2018-06-13 21:54:55 Tomorrow is #WorldBloodDonorDay2018 Show your support! Blood is one of the most critical commodities in healthcare, every two seconds somebody in the U.S. needs access to it.  Do you plan to give???

42 2018-06-13 21:30:00 Good. But commodities in our markets are expensive. Agric stuff are reasonable when compared. But others and household goods!
43 2018-06-13 21:22:11 The other problem was that Boston was nowhere near as good at the time the it arguments were being made. You have a contender now if healthy, then you just had Thomas, Horford and Brown as known commodities.

Kyrie can also play with stars, IT needs every single touch
44 2018-06-13 21:11:24 Women Are Not Commodities . This is an insult 
45 2018-06-13 21:08:57 Socialists don't support prisons, period. Angela Davis points out that the computability of state punishment in terms of time mirrors how capitalists measure the value of commodities by labor-time. She claims the commodity form arose when penitentiary sentences became prominent.
46 2018-06-13 21:06:01 Convenience and stress reduction will be some of the most valuable commodities going forward.
47 2018-06-13 21:00:33 E com o Mercado Global bombando.... commodities vão ferver mais.... ciclo bacana pela frente...
48 2018-06-13 20:17:31 And we are angry that Trump's tariffs are destabilizing commodities markets which threatens family farms. GOP are enemy of MO ag.
49 2018-06-13 20:15:16 Yes honestly. Buying commodities like that doesn’t make you successful. Imaging someone who is middle class and saves up to buy that,  does that make him successful because he owns an iPhone X Liabilities like that doesn’t mean anything. It depreciates. 
50 2018-06-13 20:15:08 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on -- certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be. -- John Burbank
51 2018-06-13 20:07:29 tirei conclusão parecida por conta de um "modelo" q leva em consideração ppp, commodities e cds. Teria q ter uma piora significativa nas variaveis.
52 2018-06-13 19:59:17 This is a good thread that I feel like has been waiting to happen for a while. (My own take is that if you want good things to happen without killing people you legislate social democracy and then have increasing social ownership of things that are basically commodities)
53 2018-06-13 19:49:21 It is. As reinforced by Flint today.
Workers treated as commodities to be turned on and off by the Great Leaders' tap.
The really odd thing is control is possible within current Lisbon Treaty rules.
Everyone should question what's happening in Westminster this week.
54 2018-06-13 19:42:04 Human beings are not just commodities.
55 2018-06-13 19:41:00 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
56 2018-06-13 19:36:09 It’s a continuation of the extraction of wealth. Two of the most crushing embargo’s are as a result of being asked to pay the fair market rate for commodities
57 2018-06-13 19:35:28 Any amnesty says that it's OK to steal one of the most valuable commodities in the world: US Citizenship.

Should we treat adoptive parenthood the same as naturalized citizenship? If you steal a baby and raise it well for 5 years, you get to keep it...?
58 2018-06-13 19:31:05 Our economy has already been ravaged by Justine and the rest of the Lefty World opposing pipelines & not allowing us to get our commodities to the best market. Or not allowing us to get those commodities to East coast where we could refine them ourselves #MoreVenezuelanOilPlease
59 2018-06-13 19:29:32 I think $ is the key to this puzzle. If we see a strong rally, I will get worried.  But I think it ultimately goes lower, commodities higher, along with inflation, and yield curve will steepen before it eventually flattens again before the ultimate recession.
60 2018-06-13 19:26:16 To fight corruption
-Standardise every item used by Govt and it's agencies.
-Set a standard price for commodities
-pay exactly  after 30Days
61 2018-06-13 19:25:01 Certainly could in many cases, but have been doing a thought experiment on this construct as seems to me that #Innovation actually creates wealth from new ideas, intellectual energy and human capital, the way commodities emerge from seed, soil, labor... not fully formed...
62 2018-06-13 19:15:51 QT is pretty gradual. Short term rates are still relatively low & 4 hikes per year is only 1% annual. Long-term rates are little-changed over the past 5 years. Rising oil might be problematic but overall inflation still below 2% and individual commodities are out of Fed's scope
63 2018-06-13 19:15:05 Chemonics seeks short-term consultants to conduct #newborn #health commodities assessments for the  #GlobalHealth #SupplyChain – #Procurement and #SupplyManagement (GHSC-PSM) project
64 2018-06-13 18:59:50 Both are  promising commodities . Wish Bobby Motaung can grab one for Khosi fans
65 2018-06-13 18:53:07 also makes sense if their children are commodities
66 2018-06-13 18:47:29 O según el pendejo de @RicardoAnayaC los campesinos mexicanos usan su smartphone para revisar las fluctuaciones diarias en los precios de commodities agrícolas.
67 2018-06-13 18:44:54 Great #investment thought for the day:
There are really just four types of asset classes:
Stocks
Bonds
Currencies
Commodities

And a possible fifth: Innovation.

I love it!

71 2018-06-13 18:21:33 Commodities and USD mostly steady following FOMC announcement.
72 2018-06-13 18:16:18 After the initial response, my guess is that the market will read this as insufficient given the obvious rising inflationary pressures. Dollar to fall, 10Y yield to rise, metals and commodities to rise.

78 2018-06-13 17:53:13 A deficit on commodities and a surplus with services. They both matter whether you want to acknowledge that or not.

81 2018-06-13 17:36:09 It’s all about controlling women- it’s not about babies or life. It’s about women as commodities
82 2018-06-13 17:30:37 By the way we don't have a surplus with Canada on commodities. We have a deficit. We also have a massive deficit with the EU & you haven't answered why you think American tax payers should pay for Europe's security. Still waiting
83 2018-06-13 17:26:55 We pretty much do already.

And Trump is talking about barrels of oil on the commodities market, not prices of gasoline.

When price of oil per barrel goes up, that's worldwide.  It doesn't matter where you pump it.

90 2018-06-13 16:49:27 It might not happen under an existing certification organization but what if "someone" developed a program just for oats (and possibly other commodities grown under a purity protocol)?
91 2018-06-13 16:48:26 To ensure quality with standard rates in commodities of daily use, SHO Larnoo(Anantnag) conducted market checking along with Tehsildar and Muncipality Officer.
92 2018-06-13 16:45:41 The Govt gives a window where tax free food commodities can be imported. Let him use that opportunity to play his ball.
93 2018-06-13 16:45:10 And the other reason is the strong global economies. Inflation hits commodities first.
94 2018-06-13 16:36:37 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.

96 2018-06-13 16:34:26 Next hobby: get into trading options on commodities like rock, lumber, wheat, and bricks.
97 2018-06-13 16:24:47 Yeah gosh what am I saying commodities purchase across state lines is exactly the same as across county lines. Laws don't differ at all.
98 2018-06-13 16:22:49 What? No “Thanks Trump!” like they blamed Obama even though it is the global commodities market that sets the prices?
99 2018-06-13 16:17:28 Despite all that Gyan which is just to feed the trolls, ask him why certain commodities like petrol are not in GST and his khaki knickers go into a twist :) @logicalindianz @yehlog
100 2018-06-13 16:11:02 I wonder if some of these politicians are playing these games to affect the Stock Mkt? I watch the mkt everyday & gold & other commodities sometimes fluctuate when 'war' is feared! Just a thought...sometimes they say weird coordinated things? #WalkAway
101 2018-06-13 15:54:41 The current gun cult argument of tyranny of government and taxes. Where do you think you get roads, bridges up keep? Want everything privately owned where you pay through the nose to use? But in the US things that should be rights are commodities. While what is a right shouldn't
102 2018-06-13 15:53:33 Implement your unreasonable tariffs and see what other commodities rise in price.
103 2018-06-13 15:52:17 #FederalReserve expected to raise interest rates today: how will this affect commodities prices? #hedgebetter
104 2018-06-13 15:48:54 You are somehow under the impression that weapons provided to terrorist entities in Libya by Qatar are perishable goods that expire at the stroke of midnight, come New Years Eve 2012. Not commodities that can be stockpiled, resold, and worst of all, to kill and intimidate Libyans

106 2018-06-13 15:43:50 Gov has ripped the salaried middle class through taxation. To buy a mid size car a person would pay 48% tax + road tax + interest on loan. GST on most commodities are unbearable . It is definitely Gabhar Singh tax.. in return middle class get Shit and only shit
107 2018-06-13 15:43:41 let us see a drop in taxes on basic commodities...inflation is turning the Kenyan shilling to mozambique dollars especially with this huge debts and the rogue officials vandalizing public funds
108 2018-06-13 15:41:19 Prime Minister of India visiting other countries is welcome. But on the other hand increasing oil prices every other day, resulting in sky rocketing of prices of essential commodities is bothersome. Giving meager fitment of 15% to PSU employees is another jolt on country's growth
109 2018-06-13 15:38:02 Three paragraphs in he is off the rails. The very nature of the production of these 3 supply managed commodities requires management to avoid oversupply, artificially low prices below the cost of production and eventual decimation of the farms and farmers. Look across the border.
110 2018-06-13 15:33:52 If anybody could point me towards some literature regarding the effects of the #CarbonTax on fuel prices as well as other commodities it would be appreciated.
111 2018-06-13 15:32:28 Start at the new firm July 2nd. 

If any professional traders (in FCA definition and the degenerate gambler definition) want a chat about custom solutions, pricing, platforms across futures, options, fixed income, FX, commodities, CFDs, then give me a shout before then.
112 2018-06-13 15:30:12 @BillieKayWWE and @PeytonRoyceWWE are precious commodities we must protect at all costs.
113 2018-06-13 15:26:05 Oil prices are increased every other day resulting sky rocketting of prices of essential commodities. Bhakts will not open their voice in this aspect. Amongst these attrocities Prime Minister visiting other countries and always on abroad trips is crazy and irresponsible.
114 2018-06-13 15:24:51 It’s tough to summarize it on twitter. I would say ‘useful labor’ is a commodity that increases the value of other commodities. In other words, the antique table would be nothing more than an antique tree, if it weren’t for useful human labor.
115 2018-06-13 15:23:48 Will FED rate hike spark a gold rally? I hope so lmao this range is dreadful #trader #fx #commodities
116 2018-06-13 15:23:30 @rammadhavbjp sir. Under UPA middle class was cursed . Under BJP after supporting demonetisation policy no increase in personal savings as expected . We ack prices of essential commodities are under control . I hope middle class will not be ur archiles heel in 2019 election .
117 2018-06-13 15:22:22 Bahahaha and then screw over all the lactose people  that would be suicide for more than just the bucks! On top of all the commodities we also have the CAFE practices team and the aide the coffee belt gets in their farms...

135 2018-06-13 13:59:32 For sure, I just think of it often as a function of time pressures and known commodities.

242 2018-06-13 06:25:11 Right @dhruv_rathee My constituency has given the duo (MP & MLA both) to @BJP4India 
Despite their long term of ruling, they've failed to provide a park, even with least commodities.
This is merely a circus that suits only to rich..
We Indians are audience only, who only claps..

247 2018-06-13 06:10:58 So ukifanya biashara na govt , county or govt institutions, its allowed to overprice commodities , Toyota dealers wanauzianga gava hilux single cab 5.7m  . 'cancer free' wheelbarrows were Bought at 109k. Heh.
248 2018-06-13 05:48:03 Development plans for India: 1) Make every Indian village self- sustainable (all food commodities grown in the village) 2) Set-up food processing plants to process food for export (eg: tomato to Tomato ketchup) 3) Build technology to bring farm produce directly to customer.

250 2018-06-13 05:42:32 Good morning sir @SimShagaya I have an agric-infotech idea that's aimed at enhancing food security through the creation of information and ultimately helping the farmers earn more on their investments, control prices of commodities seeing as the govt has abandoned it's duties.

252 2018-06-13 05:33:01 Find the correlation of price rise in commodities in past with the gross margins of the companies. But there would not have been a story then.... Not this one at least.. :)

254 2018-06-13 05:31:05 [ON AIR] @CityofJoburgZA Mayor, @HermanMashaba says the City will focus on repairs and maintenance. He also says water and electricity is something the City buys from other organisations so increase for these commodities are determined by their suppliers  #Breakfastwithdavid
255 2018-06-13 05:24:52 Taking Jos for example. Most commodities grown in Jos require cold storage facilities. Yet not even the govt is helping. I have to use my survival skills from NMS to workout the preservation of my fruits during and post transit. It's tasking but doable
256 2018-06-13 05:16:43 Policy making needs big improvement. And disruption. But a single GST rate will not work. Zero rate a must for several commodities & essential services. Then 5% for raw materials & intermediates. 12% for finished goods & rest of services. Bring Fuel into GST ambit.Think about it
257 2018-06-13 05:00:01 Commodities: Live Cattle -4.79%, Canola -1.39%
258 2018-06-13 04:55:43 Investing in crypto is lile investing in commodities in 2000s.

Herd mentality in action, especially with dumb institutional money moving. 

I hate to be the last one in.
259 2018-06-13 04:46:22 If Canada is so great, then drop the tariffs and compete like grown ups.  Fact remains at least on some commodities, Canada is also protectionist
260 2018-06-13 04:40:13 Seguro los campesinos estarán checando el precio de sus productos ..... se van a convertir en expertos en commodities
261 2018-06-13 04:34:01 These people won't talk about price reduction in almost all essential commodities & food ...Now only they have petrol to talk about.. Before end of this year petrol will also come under GST..

264 2018-06-13 04:11:55 Commodities Trading Results (C) - Brent oil:-

1. [08.06.18 - 12.06.18] - Long 76.50, TS 76.60, (Gain 0.13% -Int) x10
265 2018-06-13 04:10:17 Commodities Trading Results (B) - WTI oil:-

266 2018-06-13 04:09:35 Gas tax is regressive … any tax of commodities or any tax or toll that is applied evenly to all puts an undue burden on the poor.
267 2018-06-13 04:07:36 Commodities Trading Results (A) - Gold:-

1. [12.06.18 - 12.06.18] - Short 1300.00, TS 1297.50, Gain 0.19% x60

269 2018-06-13 04:04:19 Just like trading oil and other commodities
270 2018-06-13 03:59:14 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
271 2018-06-13 03:40:54 @DCDeacon Can you confirm if there are NPC vendors in FO76?  I have just come to the realization that if there isn't, then water, rad-away, stimpacks, etc. will all become player created (or found) commodities that could lead to a player driven economy.
272 2018-06-13 03:28:48 I’m a commodities trader,- my “regrets” portfolio is looking bullish for 2018. And the ROI on “impulsive behavior” has already beat 2017. If my projections prove accurate, the last quarter of 2018 will bubble “fml” bonds.
273 2018-06-13 03:17:25 Ya perdimos a @RicardoAnayaC con sus ejemplos sobre el uso práctico de la tecnología y el internet. El campesino estará atento al mercado de futuros de los commodities, si tiene un smartphone en sus manos.

274 2018-06-13 03:01:25 Hes going to over heat our economy and drive interest rates up, but being someone who a cash or pays in full interest rates dont bother me. Actually it would be nice to keep up with inflation on savings without having to back w commodities
275 2018-06-13 02:59:19 sorry Elon we love your every action but not this one. the hire & fire custom is one of the few remaining evil practices that society legitimize. they are human being - not commodities to be guided by demand & supply rules. stop hiring spree if u are so desperate in cutting cost
276 2018-06-13 02:58:39 Parem de subestimar o homem... Olha o trump!! Vcs subestimam demais o Bolsonaro. 
Pior que Sarney, Collor, Dilma,Temer ele nao vai ser . Certeza !! Ele ainda vai pegar um boom de commodities, se ele fizer reformas logo em 2019 a gente vai tá em ascensao e o mundo em recessao.
277 2018-06-13 02:57:20 Export (as of 2016).

278 2018-06-13 02:49:05 I don't think people are investing their millions in commodities because their firm think peru have been overpriced in group g. 

Vast majority don't understand there's a science to compiling prices. They're listening to olly the octopus.
279 2018-06-13 02:46:25 False example. There were plenty of those commodities before the hyperinflation brought on by oil speculation. Who fuels this speculation? Billionaires, of course.

The only remaining question of how to deal with billionaires is BBQ or stew?
280 2018-06-13 02:46:22 I think this can be a good economic endeavor for the United States. We have a lot of commodities they badly need.
281 2018-06-13 02:39:38 If you say so. If you look through ANY institutional manager database you’ll be lucky if .1% of managers are chart based. And they’ll be concentrated in FX/Commodities. Those guys have still gotten smoked by people like Hasenstab. The high TO/Trading ones are more quant based.

283 2018-06-13 01:52:12 Commodities

West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6 percent to $65.95 a barrel after gaining for two days.

Gold was little changed at $1,295.36 an ounce.
284 2018-06-13 01:49:38 Point being: you’d be trading a collection of developing talent for a chance to develop 1 draft pick. You’re trading known commodities of value for an unknown. Because to move into the first THAT high it will take a number of REAL prospects. Seems counterproductive.
285 2018-06-13 01:38:49 they should rescue but it is unlikely. Animals are considered to be property, commodities.... 'things' and wildlife is typically valued at the bottom of consideration. #IntrinsicvValue #Empathy
286 2018-06-13 01:26:18 Dear @nextofficial,
If I didn’t receive the shipment today I will return your commodities and it will the last time I deal with you

289 2018-06-13 00:40:31 Sanity and common sense are becoming very rare commodities these days.

If you find people with these qualities, cherish them and treat them like gold.

293 2018-06-13 00:30:17 I take it that “facts” and/or “experts” are trading commodities? Currently I’d say the two most lucrative trades are common sens...ahh nope. Tolerance and British valu...bugger! Erm? Hobnobs and Jaffa cakes?
294 2018-06-13 00:07:31 All the discussion around the rhetoric of The Division 2 just makes me think of how regarding games as commodities over culture only serves to benefit large companies.
