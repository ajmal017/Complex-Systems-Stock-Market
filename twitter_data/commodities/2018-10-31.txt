14 2018-10-31 22:36:47 I never really cared for Kudlow anyway as he was “partner“ with Rick Santilli, the ranting commodities trader. No, it seems as though I was right. He has no credibility and he made a stupid move the be Donald Trump’s economic advisers. He now carries drops water.
15 2018-10-31 22:26:29 One of the stupidest arguments I've seen in some time. Well done!
Culture isn't a an economic medium or a means to represent the value of commodities. PC/SJWs assign value to cultures, like you did here, and in doing so, made PC/SJW outrage analogous to money, not culture itself.
16 2018-10-31 22:16:09 So it should behave like the commodities backed Venezuelan #Petro? I disagree, cryptocurrencies cater to an unfulfilled necessity, to make quick, cheap and decentralized payments. Also it's value has risen from 0 to 6k, precisely because it satisfies a specific need

38 2018-10-31 22:05:28 It’s insane how much money you would’ve made if you invested in commodities in ‘08
39 2018-10-31 22:03:45 I struggle to understand how donkeys chosen to carry Mary and Jesus would in any other society be revered and not treated this way.

Donkeys are not commodities they toil selflessly for all of us with no choice and are treated as badly as any species can be.
Time for change.
40 2018-10-31 22:03:33 The global elite are self serving psychopaths and therefore all  establishments are evil simply because the people are just commodities to them. This is a battle of European imperialists vs European people not UK baddies vs EU goodies.
41 2018-10-31 21:58:16 Jajajajaja pues empiece a rogar q el petroleo se ponga a 100 dolares y q los chinos le hagan de nuevo el milagrito de los demas commodities, por que de lo contrario pailas.
42 2018-10-31 21:55:34  Thanks. Sportsmanship & respect are rare commodities these days. Good luck with the rest of the season. Make noise and wake up your neighbours! 
43 2018-10-31 21:52:29 If I'm not mistaken, for the GTAA/Ivy Portfolio, October has triggered a sell signal in US Stocks (VTI), Real Estate (VNQ), and Commodities (DBC), which would leave it 100% cash, as exits already triggered in Foreign Stocks (VEU) in May, and US Bonds (IEF) this time last year.
44 2018-10-31 21:31:09 Denunciam, só q o Brasil depende muito da exportação de commodities e, com isso, os latifundiários raramente sofrem alguma penalização por seus atos, é uma correlação de forças entre mais fortes, empresários do campo e mais francos, indígenas, camponeses, entendeu o que é minoria
45 2018-10-31 21:31:05 I actually have two questions: What are some of the main risks involved with investing in commodities, and what would you look for to mitigate those risks? Also, what would be your recommended method to determine how much of a portfolio is invested in commodities?
46 2018-10-31 21:30:08 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.
47 2018-10-31 21:29:22 A galera tem que ser muito burra pra achar que ruralista quer que acabe ministério do meio ambiente. Se o País começar a quebrar acordos internacionais de meio ambiente, muitos países vão começar a boicotar compra de commodities brasileiros e todo mundo sai perdendo.
48 2018-10-31 21:07:33 Humans really do make absolute hell for sentient beings that are just used as commodities. We really should of evolved past this in 2018! 
49 2018-10-31 21:06:51 Yes. It's the Ivy Portfolio / GTAA signal. Basket of US stocks (VTI), Foreign (VEU), US bonds (IEF), Real Estate (VNQ), Commodities (DBC).
50 2018-10-31 21:02:51 Haha in fairness, it was in exchange for a cigarette, so I guess dare needed to focus more closely on the trading of commodities!
51 2018-10-31 20:56:59 So while I might objectify her at times or others via my gaze I domt treat humans as commodities in general and I can value their varied qualities beyond sex appeal.

60 2018-10-31 20:06:35 Gracas ao Plano Real, c a estabilizacao da moeda, todos os avanços dos ultimos 20 anos foram possiveis. Lula surfou nessa onda, e na alta dos commodities. Deu sorte! Pq nada construiu..só destruiu c politicas economicas equivocadas q quase quebraram o país.
61 2018-10-31 20:05:42 Depois que governos estrangeiros tomarem providências em relação ao dano ao meio ambiente, caso o ministério da agricultura e meio ambiente (puta que pariu, que combinação merda) faça merda, ai quero ver o bonoro reclamando que não vende commodities. É um caralho
62 2018-10-31 20:03:04 I appreciate, greatly, that you raise the core issue that 'labor' is different than other commodities, inherently so. I think that's key and we need to build on that core premise.
63 2018-10-31 19:58:05 I think for Gold and other commodities to go higher the dollar has to weaken considerably which isn't the case currently. Odd because the money supply continues to expand.
64 2018-10-31 19:53:45 Eu vi gente comentando que a China não deixaria de comprar commodities do Brasil no governo anti-comunista do Bolsonaro, e eu tinha falado aqui que se a China quiser ela deixa o Brasil e vai investir na África
65 2018-10-31 19:43:09 Most meat is sold thru the commodities market. In these markets the amount that producers put into the market is the same. Futures speculators and government programs ensure that they get paid no matter what. So no. Not eating meat does nothing to reduce that supply.
66 2018-10-31 19:32:31 Inflation people, inflation.... The dollars is losing it's buying power over basic commodities.... Is it the end of the road for the Petro-Dollar?
67 2018-10-31 19:25:18 If only they understood that revaluing gold higher for use as a neutral reserve asset to settle commodities would be a boon to the US & global economies...SMH
68 2018-10-31 19:22:58 Boom dos commodities.. foi bom para o mundo inteiro. Lula surfou e se aproveitou pra depois se f.... não foram eles os donos do crescimento ta ok!
69 2018-10-31 19:18:39 Stocks should not be used as a comparison. Other currencies or commodities work way better. Stocks have never had an extended bear market, actually, as our currency supply, GDP, and population have been consistently growing. That will never change

72 2018-10-31 19:04:04 I don't care one way or the other whether she stays married or not, what I care about is being promised hope and change, and getting the worst neocon hawks, and cheerleaders for Gramm-Leach-Billy, and the Commodities Futures modernization act.
73 2018-10-31 19:03:20 it refers to commodities.
74 2018-10-31 18:59:57 So any improvement?? Price of commodities should be stabilised
75 2018-10-31 18:57:37 Melhorar a estrutura do país? Já ouviu falar em acordos internacionais que proíbem commodities com selos de desmatamento, trabalho escravo e bioma amazônico? Se o Mito seguir com o Plano, o Agro vai explodir. Brasil não venderá um grão de cereal.
76 2018-10-31 18:56:50 So would price of commodities I guess

78 2018-10-31 18:56:14 "Everything in China is fake" What a lie! Hahahaaa..The greatest trading nation in the history of the world is trading in fake commodities. The hundreds of countries trading with China must be very stupid.
79 2018-10-31 18:49:50 What #bloqueo?

82 2018-10-31 18:43:37 It’s not project fear it’s a fact, less demand equals less value for the currency, that’s why sterling lost 20% of its value against global reserve currency the dollar and we then imported inflation because all commodities are priced in dollars, Jesus you people are thick
83 2018-10-31 18:39:36 So should the President queue for fuel and commodities with us nhai Advocate. At least he acknowledges we are in a mess and this country needs to be fixed not grandstanding.
84 2018-10-31 18:37:08 For sustainable development, aid needs to move towards building institutions rather than buying commodities, we have to move out of the 'emergency mode' and move towards a sustainable response. @ckurowski @WorldBank #SDGs

86 2018-10-31 18:34:04 Basicamente, pois o Brasil importa muito valor agregado (eletrônicos, substâncias químicas, patentes), petróleo, e exporta comida, dólar alto encarece o preço da gasolina e demais commodities, tornando a comida mais cara e de pior qualidade pro consumidor local.

91 2018-10-31 18:09:47 É por isso que é importante retomar o equilíbrio orçamentário. Já conseguimos reduzir endividamento nos governos Lula, dá pra fazer de novo. Só que sem arrecadação atípica de um super ciclo de commodities, tem que liquidar passivo.

99 2018-10-31 17:37:23 Não tenho nenhum jumento de estimação, a China é grande é verdade mas nao possui a quantidade de terras cultiváveis suficiente pra alimentar seu povo e nenhum outro país hoje consegue suplir a sua demanda de commodities

101 2018-10-31 17:36:12 Kanye may be struggling.  He has been used for years. Just like Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, & all these other commodities. They are humans made in the image of God. I pray they will be redeemed to His righteous purpose.
102 2018-10-31 17:33:48 O meio ambiente precisa ser preservado, sim, mas ele também precisa cumprir com a tal "função social", que Srta sabe muito bem que existe. É dele que retiramos a base da nossa economia, afinal somos uma pátria produtora de commodities e consumidora de IPhones.
103 2018-10-31 17:27:08 Govt should also  withdraw licences  for  shops which are over changing , basic commodities.
104 2018-10-31 17:27:01 Theoretically pennies per ounces after stock market and commodities readjustment for practical applications, gold could go under 97.50 an ounce clause it sucks as an asset
105 2018-10-31 17:24:55 Good point. CumExp is only way to make apple/apple comparisons. Avg team member has 20+ yrs exp. I have 30 in options on commodities. As to ROR vs W/L ratios: Subs. can assess implicit ROR via RT entr/exit pces.   Noone is more transparent than @opptrader1 .
106 2018-10-31 17:22:44 E não da nem pra justificar dizendo q o pais melhorou numa onda de commodities, realmente ele executou um papel importante, embora tenha q admitir minha ignorância sobre o governo dele.
107 2018-10-31 17:22:43 Commodities: #Palm Oil -3.35%, #Wheat -1.90% #Palladium (1.11%).
Top commodity losers are Palm Oil (-3.35%), Wheat (-1.90%) and Gasoline (-1.27%). Gains are led by Orange Juice (1.59%), Canola (1.29%) and Palladium (1.11%).
108 2018-10-31 17:19:49 At a relatively small scale yes. And we also have some operations trading actual commodities too. Been the most stressful part of our business this past year
109 2018-10-31 17:18:47 Quite looking forward to commodities becoming a little cheaper.

116 2018-10-31 16:50:12 We have been reduced to sharing updates oh who is taking what is supposed to be local currency, updates on where u can get basic commodities, and celebrating when we get a bit of the things that are supposed to be readily available

120 2018-10-31 16:37:23 We still don't have basic commodities in mqjor shops and u busy saying industries are open. Kupi!
121 2018-10-31 16:33:01 Cars might be around 1/3, but transportation much larger share. The salient point is how this framing is typically used, to tamper down concerns about effects coming to the oil industry. Which is silly, because *everything* that matters to commodities happens at the margin.
122 2018-10-31 16:26:58 Seriously those answers she gave . I used to work in imports/exports before I did the pop music stuff. I worked for an international commodities company on the physical copper trading + Global shipping desk. So I do know a bit about it!! 
123 2018-10-31 16:24:59 En un mundo competitivo, la ideología de izquierda no es más que chatarra. La izquierda sólo "funciona" con precios altos de las commodities, cuando hay plata para tirar en abundancia.

126 2018-10-31 16:22:14 Hi there Eddie, due rising costs of ingredients, commodities and other manufacturing expenses we have reduced the weight of some Cadbury products. However, we believe that Cadbury chocolate still remains an affordable treat.

129 2018-10-31 16:16:10 For commodities, it’s mostly about substitution (think bananas vs blueberries for Larry David), though some people could eat less. For branded foods, they have less power today due to improved private label offerings - 365 from Whole Foods, anything at TJs, natures promise, etc.

133 2018-10-31 16:09:39 Of course not. I look for trade signals at around 3 PM when market is about to close. Although, I would have to admit that trading in commodities demands more screen time than I had anticipated. Honestly, it's not much fun.

135 2018-10-31 15:53:16 Well said by @Shehzad_Ind it was era of looting India, now is ease of doing business.

151 2018-10-31 14:45:27 The scale of homelesness in Cardiff is so depressing. Fuck capitalism for making this possible and fuck Cardiff council, the Welsh government and UK government for seeing these peoples as commodities unworthy of support instead of as people.
152 2018-10-31 14:41:17 My first TFSA investment was a commodities fund through my bank that was principal protected and locked in for five years. I was so excited by the principal protection. Seemed smart at the time. After five years my principal was returned  Live and learn

Intangible assets can now be digitally priced via HFT technology, no need for buying and selling.

Stocks can practically remain high forever, meaning Wall Street would have to shut down as nobody will trade.

Only commodities can now be really traded.

208 2018-10-31 09:55:53 I'm not even that current but I think if the govt give-in, the consumer market won't be looking good. Price of commodities will go up and that's going to be another movie titled "back to square one". Ayam still a quack economist :)

210 2018-10-31 09:25:29 Stabilization reserves is by buying commodities when prices are low to reduce supply and sell when prices are high to keep prices in check This can help protect farmers’ incomes and mitigate the effect of steep price rises on consumers
211 2018-10-31 09:23:04 I hope this increment on the minimum wage wouldn't bring about increase on price commodities too. Because in Nigeria, when the value or price of a common appreciates its will never go down again. Funny enough this was not the kind of change I opted for with the APC administration

216 2018-10-31 08:52:43 The government may prevent the firms in forming combinations to set a high price. Often the government prefers to control the prices of essential commodities with a view to prevent the exploitation of the consumers.
217 2018-10-31 08:50:17 Its all the same not reasonable to include patent rights over commodities of that sort. One would wonder how we are going to develop if ownership of cows is also patented. How now will poor farmers work it out?
218 2018-10-31 08:46:57 Sekalipun seluruh dunia mulai meninggalkan sektor pertanian. Tidak ada keharusan Indonesia juga melakukannya. Indonesia bisa menjadi negara maju meskipun tidak meninggalkan pertanian. Caranya adalah mengembangkan sektor ini dengan sangat baik.

230 2018-10-31 07:50:47 Increment of minimum wage or fall in the prices of commodities? I will go with the latter.

232 2018-10-31 07:30:39 For a start it's included in bulk commodities, not base commodities. Secondly, the RBA uses free on board prices which don't include freight costs etc. The prices used are also based on customs data, not market rates like spot.
233 2018-10-31 07:29:01 Those who were buyers of commodities for which they were nominated as Principal Auctioneers, are now busy asking for our votes......kumo, they want to consolidate on their greedy past.

237 2018-10-31 06:51:31 As the largest port in Ghana, Tema Port fulfills a major role in the economical development of Ghana, operating as the gateway to Ghana, as a leading container port in West Africa, and as a main import port of commodities such as food products, consumer goods and materials.
238 2018-10-31 06:41:38 So it's N30,000 nPower that will take away poverty in a country were Prices of commodities keep going higher or is it the N10,000 trade moni loan that will start a business to eradicate poverty. We need to do better as humans and avoid sentiments
239 2018-10-31 06:36:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.
240 2018-10-31 06:31:48 India has all the resources. We should produce more ourselves.

242 2018-10-31 06:29:19 The rupee has depreciated. Current account deficit is rising. Why has the rupee depreciated? Due to a lot of imports ?? India has abundant resources still we import same commodities. #GoaMining @goacm @PMOIndia @nstomar @nitin_gadkari @makeinindia @Indiamining @sureshpprabhu
243 2018-10-31 06:23:08 Our eyes done open oo, I voted for change but what am seeing is no where close to change. The only change I see is the price of commodities going up everyday in the market if that is the change then I don't need this kind of change.
244 2018-10-31 06:04:56 Still, China remains Brazil’s top trade partner – ahead of the U.S., with bilateral trade reaching $75 billion last year. In parallel to being an avid consumer of Brazilian commodities, Beijing has already invested $124 billion in Brazilian co ,infrastructure projects since 2003.

248 2018-10-31 05:49:15 Human bodies are not commodities just because you want to sell your body doesn't mean people should have the right to purchase it a lot of women including myself have been sex trafficked and no one has a right to another person's body.
249 2018-10-31 05:49:07 Non US stocks. Commodities.

252 2018-10-31 05:37:56 There's a lie in there about commodities. We're getting sweet fuck all from gas and coal and the rest. They made a shit load from entry fees. But I smell a lying rat.
253 2018-10-31 05:37:28 when marx wrote about the fetishism of the commodities he was just kinkshaming
254 2018-10-31 05:30:55 I just think some coaches don’t want that pressure. Texas, in back to back hires, picked up two extremely hot commodities (Strong, Herman). Alabama has similar expectations, and got Saban. OSU does too, and they got Meyer. Big potential comes with big expectations
255 2018-10-31 05:21:15 Esos instrumentos desde mi punto de vista son muy estables para una inversión de largo plazo, es más conveniente tener una proporción mayor en algo con mas riesgo como las acciones o commodities

Worth noting utilities and staples are leading lately. But I think it's more related to inflationary/fed/commodities cycle.Which is last cycle of bull market.
259 2018-10-31 04:57:34 I didn't like the post. I didn't laugh.. I just said it was better than shooting them. Yes, riots bring on shooting and they've been going through hell. How does someone like, Maduro, keep getting voted in?

262 2018-10-31 04:33:54 First you're asking if it was in Venezuela... now you're for sure saying they shot them too. 
263 2018-10-31 04:30:29 Why are tea, coffee, sugar, sisal, leather etc, these are Kenya's big export markets yet we are importing these commodities. Production and value addition is questionable yet we have the capacity of doing so. We need to revisit our policies on self sustainability.
264 2018-10-31 04:29:41 It was a riot and they used the water trucks. Better than shooting them. Yes, it was in Venezuela. It's on Youtube as well. Why don't you go complain on YT?

275 2018-10-31 03:35:17 Só te digo mais uma coisa: O mundo não verá isso com bons olhos. É bem possível que países deixem de fazer comércio de commodities ou mesmo fará mais exigências. Só a China hj age dessa maneira predatória, mas ela tá se adequando, enquanto nós vamos caminhar pra trás.

279 2018-10-31 03:04:00 You should understand that destabilization, chaos and terrorism are tools that Assad family used to protect their reign. It's a strategy, an advantage for them. But Syria and Syrians are not just commodities that Assad family own and inherit. Specially after all that's happened.
280 2018-10-31 03:02:04 late 15 was the lagged impact on CNY's appreciation in 14 and 15 (along with USD) + weakness in global demand for capital goods after commodities fell.

294 2018-10-31 01:50:11 I think it's unfortunate that Sanders prefers to hold on to purity stances.

I think it's unfortuante that Bernie prefers to find solutions for people who can afford commodities, rather than the poor.

I also think his gun reform votes are unfortunate too.

307 2018-10-31 00:43:34 The stocks fell off a cliff, yet Commodities haven’t rallied. Checking on: Copper, Gold, Silver, Coffee, and Oil, and I don’t see that major rally you called for. Perhaps, the “end of cycle” isn’t here yet. It’s 2018, not 2022.
308 2018-10-31 00:30:39 We are always going to have a hella big problem with sex-work being too dangerous of an industry, since it implies that the workers are nothing but sexual commodities to be bought & not people performing a service (kinda like furniture vs. house cleaning services).
309 2018-10-31 00:29:34 I'm going to stick to selling puts on commodities for a while. I think gold  is at the beginning of a long bull market so it's almost like a zero risk game. Worse case is assignment which will just be buying low. Then  I can just keep selling covered calls at a higher stikes!

312 2018-10-31 00:19:11 Yes and keeps the stock and commodities markets falsely inflated.
313 2018-10-31 00:16:44 The modern monetary theory written by capitalist economists. Some of the economics academy is starting to challenge this view. Inflation is the result of increasing the money supply faster than productive capacity, which then inflates demand for commodities.

315 2018-10-31 00:02:15 Pot stocks trade goods, services, and commodities for which there is potentially insatiable demand. Dot coms and crypto trade in intangible ideas that may or may not catch on. Not a bubble, but a temporarily overvalued sector that has now corrected and will resume trend up.
