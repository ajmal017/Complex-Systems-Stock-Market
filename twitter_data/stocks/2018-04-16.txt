38 2018-04-16 23:41:28 probably got paid back in the form of Trump agreeing to tip him off to sell stocks short before he tweets something dumb that tanks the market.  Let's check his trading in options on AMZN.
39 2018-04-16 23:38:15 If the debts only your mortgage I'm not sure I'd start liquidating stocks to pay it off. Just treat it like you're snowballing and throw everything at it if you want to pay it off that badly
40 2018-04-16 23:36:33 Look at why a company buys back their own stocks. Investopedia has info.  It's a business decision. Businesses are in business for a profit. Did you read the article you posted? What evidence do you have on "none" of the companies are investing in growth?
41 2018-04-16 23:35:55 Include somewhere up there Link mains who know how to glide toss but only use it in between stocks and not in neutral
42 2018-04-16 23:35:28 True. Chaplin did sell his stocks the year before the crashafter reading a book. Saved him a lot. #ChaplinMovie
43 2018-04-16 23:34:35 In previous years, thousands of Syrian refugees were accepted into America, this year its been 11. Include the fact Stocks for these War Profiteer companies sored with the Internationally Illegal #SyriaStrikes, and it being done "for the Syrian people",
Proves its BS! #tytlive
44 2018-04-16 23:34:30 Is that why all the big companies are buying back stocks instead of giving raises? Sure they gave  bonuses but that was to cover up the fact they are making billions !!! Hypocrite !!!
45 2018-04-16 23:34:25 Haha. NO!

Seriously though, no one stocks these sizes besides Asos. No one. I've already been forced to shop online only. It would be so hard for petite people to find clothes that fit. We shouldn't be allowed clothes because us being a small size makes some people sad? What? 
46 2018-04-16 23:34:13 Stocks aren't valued by efficiency or quality of product though, but by demand and monopoly. Missiles that don't work well are better for missile makers, because you need to shoot 100 to hit 3 targets. When you have guaranteed govt. contracts you have no incentive for efficiency.
47 2018-04-16 23:32:43 @vinland Good for you. See too many traders eager to buy stocks based (only) on them being lower and worse yet with no exit plan. $STUDY

49 2018-04-16 23:32:23 Rich, I think they have his returns if they raided his lawyer. U, me and my husband r all sick giving money to trump.  that is how it feels.  That and tax refunds for corporations to buy back their stocks which they r doing. Only ftrump doesnt understand this or doesnt care.

51 2018-04-16 23:31:13 Many of our recos have gone up silently without any fuss.  These are the stocks which i like the most. A great example is a south based chemical stock. Not tom tomed anywhere hence does its job steadily discreetly.

54 2018-04-16 23:25:42 It is absolutely deplorable, that people can invest in the Military Industrial Complex & then hope for a war, to bump up their stocks.

59 2018-04-16 23:18:54 La Russie a négocié un accord visant la destruction des stocks et s'était engagée à le faire respecter. Cinq ans après, des armes chimiques sont manifestement encore utilisées. Il est encore plus sûr que se refuser à toute analyse diachronique par avance n'est pas rationnel.

77 2018-04-16 23:10:06 #tytlive Perhaps the George Soros' of the world could purchase a controlling interest in defense stocks & place the portfolios in the hands of the men, women & children of Syria &other bombing zones & see if they are willing to bomb their stockholders...

83 2018-04-16 23:08:41 We don't even know why our stocks are going up. You guys know how it is, you wake up one morning and people just keep handing you free money through no fault of your own. Right? Don't you just hate it? #tytlive
84 2018-04-16 23:08:13 There is something so oddly satisfying about researching stocks and crunching numbers.
85 2018-04-16 23:08:12 yknow what's stressful? fake buying stocks for a "game" (read: project) in business class that follows actual stock trends and our grade is based on how much money we make in comparison to other people in the class. aka if we pick stocks that take a plunge we could be screwed

87 2018-04-16 23:06:50 On morning Joe they were talking about how corporations were buying back stock. They were saying how that was making the stocks look strong. So gov't sponsored market manipulation

90 2018-04-16 23:04:58 Yes, stocks soared when Trump bombed Syria. It's almost as if the military-industrial complex benefits from pushing him into conflict with Russia. Could that be an explanation for the Russia hysteria? Seems like there might be a connection. #tytlive
91 2018-04-16 23:04:09 Not if they have bump stocks.

102 2018-04-16 22:56:29 You mean your tax scam that makes hard working poorly paid people footing the bill for your rich people who don't pay their share & those wealthy corporations who are buying back their stocks and paying executives lots more. As Paul Ryan said; "fuck poor people".
103 2018-04-16 22:54:59 @tracybeanz In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005.[9] The stocks were a result of Google’s acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth.
104 2018-04-16 22:54:22 The stocks of the missile makers should’ve plummeted because they had a 70 failure rate and could not penetrate the Syrian air defences let alone a modern Russian s300 or s400 System. No one is reporting this abject failure as more tax payers money get shovelled into useless kit.

261 2018-04-16 20:43:19 Monday is usually the most hated day of the week... unless you’re a trader. Great day today with lots of opportunities and positions. Hope everyone had a great start to the week. Let’s keep it going  $BYOC $SGDH $LDSI #Investing #Knowledge #Stocks #cryptocurrency
262 2018-04-16 20:42:56 Doing that with #bitcoin myself. Quit my day job to enjoy life. Wish I was old enough for those stocks. Damn markets doa tho... But I did take advantage of the BTC opportunity 
263 2018-04-16 20:42:05 Bitches come round when the stocks up
264 2018-04-16 20:41:03 Sryia's oil stocks not so important I guess.

268 2018-04-16 20:39:03 It gets good when they study the Pearson correlation coefficient between said two stocks
269 2018-04-16 20:38:53 @maddow 
Since you guys are killing it with the investigative journalism, can you please look into Trump, his Twitter wars, and the stock market? It feels like a cash grab for him and his cronies. I bet they bought a ton of Amazon stocks during his feud. #racket
270 2018-04-16 20:38:41 One lesson that always rehaunts me is to stick to my fknn stoppps - must religiously live by this rule. The market is always right  #stocks
271 2018-04-16 20:38:22 Dear Donald! I think you were short on Russian stocks week ago and today you were long :) Easy money!))
272 2018-04-16 20:38:06 (2/2) the math behind a new pension obligation bond won't work for the reasons Filan cited; in fact it could backfire horrifically. Finally, return assumptions of 7% are still too high unless the $ is 100% invested in stocks--the unfunded liability is even higher than assumed.
273 2018-04-16 20:36:09 Man yall Protesting and Starbucks stocks doin well today,,, go head sale me yalls
274 2018-04-16 20:35:19 If bravatek is bought out or merg what would happen to my stocks and everyone else stocks with bravatek
275 2018-04-16 20:34:30 Lol I was at my desk today and was able to log into etrade not always the case and the rest of the week I'll be busy but for all the new followers wanted to show HOW I GET BUSY WITH THESE STOCKS! LOL
276 2018-04-16 20:34:25 I should have put it in the tweet, but no stocks used 
277 2018-04-16 20:34:25 Very true.
I still see so many people looking for the next big thing in canna penny stocks. That moment is passed.
Follow the success, as we head into legalization.
278 2018-04-16 20:33:50 Would that change your stance on the uranium stocks?
279 2018-04-16 20:32:14 But guess what!?!  Y’all gonna go line up for Starbucks tomorrow. Y’all ain’t about change, we just typing in social media. When I see Starbucks stocks drop cause the most powerful consumers ‘us’ boycott then I’ll believe.
280 2018-04-16 20:32:09 The art of make a great return from the best stocks alert is simple  ( Following the best entry as much as you can and do not throw all your cash at one stock). I can show how much only one V.I.P member since March by following the price entry levels.
281 2018-04-16 20:30:52 Curious how their indirect exposure to US stocks via hedge funds or LT beta exposure via ETFs adds up

284 2018-04-16 20:25:47 Awful! Millennials Used My Blue Chip Stocks ...!!!!
285 2018-04-16 20:25:15 True re. debt stocks, but I imagine growth might fluctuate more on a monthly basis for example. Although I think that global factors are crucial, I'm thinking that this method may downplay the national factors that could exist. Not meant as critique, am just curious.
286 2018-04-16 20:24:08 Obama didn’t get us into anything. We were safe, economy was high, stocks were booming and unemployment was low. We had no worries
287 2018-04-16 20:21:57 In 6 years I see myself not having a job

But instead Invest Stocks, Crypto, affiliate marketing for a living.

289 2018-04-16 20:21:35 Stocks build on last week's gains. Dow ends +212, +0.9% to 24,573.
Nasdaq +0.7%, S&P +0.8%.

Small-company stocks shine again, Russell 2000 +0.9%.

291 2018-04-16 20:20:50 Well, $NFLX kicked the shit out of earnings!!! Dammit, I knew I should have bought some calls! O well, tech looks good! #FAANG stocks it is for calls this week and next!
292 2018-04-16 20:20:48 #Breaking: Netflix adds 2 million US subscribers in last 3 months. Stocks shoots higher after hours. $NFLX
293 2018-04-16 20:20:46 I think we should bring back the stocks, put them on the National Mall for 24 hours, and allow people to throw trash & rotten produce.
294 2018-04-16 20:20:33 I just don't like how the SGMO people all bash Crisper stocks. No class but I guess you know more than the Goldman Analyst.
295 2018-04-16 20:20:10 World stocks mixed: US +.8%; Europe -.4%. Investors shifted focus from trade & political risk to expected 1Q earnings. Another day with volatility above average; what we should expect to see day after day. Don't make error & sell on the next 500 point down day - there will be one
296 2018-04-16 20:20:01 $AMZN has shelved their plan to sell drugs to hospitals, selling pharma stocks upwards today
297 2018-04-16 20:19:51 best stock so far in my portfoli $NFLX #GiddyUp
298 2018-04-16 20:19:27 #Grains closed lower. US Dollar & Crude were lower. US stocks, Gold & #Cocoa were higher. Livestock mixed  today.
299 2018-04-16 20:19:21 You may be asking this question because journalism is not something you've studied. Think of it this way. What if we had just found out after a deluge of Sean Hannity segments recommending drinking rat poison that Sean Hannity was 100% invested in rat poison stocks?
300 2018-04-16 20:19:03 That's odd because my stocks were showing positive growth under obama. Since trump came in, i've lost 30%. And most of my money is actually in federal funds. Maybe if he stopped tweeting crazy all the time, the market would stabilize
301 2018-04-16 20:18:26 Soybeans, corn and wheat closed lower. US Dollar & #Crude were lower. US stocks, #Gold & Cocoa were higher. Livestock mixed.
302 2018-04-16 20:18:15 Liar. Just today I heard how corporations are using their tax cuts to buy back stocks. None of that goes into our walIets.

305 2018-04-16 20:17:15 Stared at my five 3 dollar Fitbit stocks for 30 minutes today instead of learning more about managing group policies
306 2018-04-16 20:16:52 Paper trading: Shorted $CGIX on that premature second push for highs, once i saw that hammer candle got formed, I got short 1.635, risking of the highs (4 cent risk), final cover at 1.47, best cover at 1.43... and the thing rolled all the way down to 1.33 smh #daytrading #stocks
307 2018-04-16 20:16:22 We can no longer consider the cries of "fake news" from @potus as anything but whining and an attempt to manipulate stocks, ratings and viewers, now that we know he and @seanhannity are #LawyerBuddies.

311 2018-04-16 20:14:27 $NFLX I told you guys 335 Monday what’s the stock at? Professionals don’t play the earnings with options, stocks don’t have expiration dates

316 2018-04-16 20:11:18 NFLX - good report. All 500 S&P stocks need to trade higher.
317 2018-04-16 20:11:14 Other FAANG stocks getting a little lift in late trading from Netflix's upbeat quarterly results.
318 2018-04-16 20:11:04 Nothing surprising here. Those who still watch Smith said he excitedly reported the dramatic fall in the stock market during the week of up and down stocks. I found the clown to be full of hate and stopped watching him shortly after the presidential elections.
319 2018-04-16 20:10:50 He wasn't #SeanHannity's lawyer. There was no invoice of services.

However, an industry wide ethical standard would not allow report on stories involving thier lawyer, just like reporters are not allowed to report on stocks they own. Hannity should not be reporting on raid.
320 2018-04-16 20:08:37 $CANL and $MJNE both up 60%+ today big winners. Several other pot stocks up 10-25%
321 2018-04-16 20:08:25 $BYOC  Have no doubt the Bulls remain in control.  Stocks swing - but the Bulls will carry the day here.
322 2018-04-16 20:07:49 Stocks end higher as Syria fears ease, earnings in focus.

328 2018-04-16 20:06:19 @iancassel Hi Ian! A brief reflection. Do you think it sounds reasonable to focus on just a few stocks (5/6) instead of a 25/30 portfolio? The world is full of stock opportunities. So why to risk on only 5? Thank you Sir!

401 2018-04-16 19:19:03 I have about the same timeframe so I'm glad to get your view on that, thanks. How do you decide how many stocks to own in a portfolio? I read that you prefer a more concentrated portfolio right?
402 2018-04-16 19:17:33 The rebels have attacked government forces before with  chemical weapons. And with how much territory was captured and went back  and forth during the war, it is really not hard to imagine that some  stocks could end up on the other side.

407 2018-04-16 19:16:01 Agree. CNBC has analysts discussing stocks check a bunch of boxes which they display on screen and you know the analyst's  involvement in a stock he is touting. Hannity should have come clean as he certainly was not disinterested party

433 2018-04-16 18:59:33 Not sure that genie is going back in the bottle. Besides, for most people, what’s the alternative? Over-paying active managers for a 20% chance of beating the market? Stocks are broadly expensive now, but market timing is too difficult.

461 2018-04-16 18:38:54 I remember when I first started buying breakouts I would often make the mistake of buying extended stocks. Now I wait for the pullback or, as you said, wait for a new base to form. I usually consider 5% beyond the breakout extended.

489 2018-04-16 18:27:37 Tis my nature to be skeptical. Just how does banning bump stocks or effecting more efficient background checks equate to upholding the 2nd Amendment? Both do just the opposite. Trying to understand actions that many consider antithetical to the 2nd Amendment.

542 2018-04-16 17:59:18 True..Though.. Kill momentum too long and you can lock volume out forever...

608 2018-04-16 17:30:33 Unfortunately my understanding of sharia finance (especially once we get outside raising capital and investing stocks) but I did work on crypto-currencies for 3 years at the Federal Reserve. The volatility and lack of intrinsic value makes investing akin to gambling 1/2

614 2018-04-16 17:27:29 While there are legit reasons for GiC to have power to prohibit various weapons (e.g. bump stocks), firearms themselves are already covered by a classification system, & GiC should not be empowered to restrict or prohibit by regulation IMO.

632 2018-04-16 17:18:27 Well, if forewarning both the Russians and Syrians, giving them time to move stocks and personnel, you can certainly claim - 'mission accomplished.'
633 2018-04-16 17:18:19 If a viable business plan exists, many people will deploy this type of capital willing in order to exceed the typical 5%. There is a lot of money out there waiting for a great idea. Especially now, where yield in the market is hard to get (bonds). Leaving  bubbly stocks.

637 2018-04-16 17:17:35 Another lie
The CBO now reports hat 80% of all the economic gains from Trump's tax cuts will go to nations other than the US.

50% of US stocks are owned by non-US citizens.  Another bulk of the companies receiving the tax breaks are non-American companies.

660 2018-04-16 17:01:35 The stock market ISN’T indicative of the US economy. In 2007 65% of Americans owned stocks. Today, 52% own stocks. The economy is WAGE GROWTH. The .4% wage growth under Trump was behind the predicted .8%. Wage growth is what bolsters the middle class!

916 2018-04-16 14:44:27 $CELZ is probably one of many stocks I've gave public commentary on as trading it. Really don't like it but I wanted to present how you use technicals with swing trading. These type of companies are new to me but it all applies the same.

925 2018-04-16 14:41:08 Remember: it's not a stock market, it's a market of stocks.

I don't know what that means, but it sounds smart.
926 2018-04-16 14:40:55 It depends on your style but this just isn't a very good trading market right now for individual stocks. I sure don't see much of interest.

955 2018-04-16 14:32:30 Methodology for choosing ‘value stocks’ for such studies would be purely statistical e.g. lowest %ile of P/B or P/E from listed universe. Also, portfolio would be rolled over every year. Thus, a ‘Value stock’ from this sample in period 1 could well be a ‘growth stock’ in period 2

957 2018-04-16 14:31:14 Interest rates have been artificially low for years!

You're a business man.....aren't you?

Low interest rates have led to bubbles, namely in the late 1990s in tech stocks and in the mid 2000s in housing. Neither of those bubbles ended well.

We actually need higher int. rates!!

1040 2018-04-16 13:58:05 @SRuhle Matt Schlapp argues that Americans are doing better after the @GOP tax cuts. He says that stocks are doing better and home prices are up. That fine if you own stocks and a house. With rising interest rates, the hourly wage earner is still going to be left out.

1166 2018-04-16 12:52:52 Thanks! Great investors have said, “try not to make a loss rather than trying to make a profit”. Hence, my biggest positions are in stocks where chance of losing is much less (secular businesses with great managements& strong tailwinds) rather than microcaps with untested models!

1168 2018-04-16 12:52:43 Investing in cyclical stocks based on P/E ratios can be disastrous. Cyclical stocks are cheapest when, companies are losing money or have very low earnings, and most risky when they have low P/E and high price-to-book ratios.

1185 2018-04-16 12:45:52 Generally I am bullish on Russian stocks.

1187 2018-04-16 12:45:15 I explicitly referenced impact of swaps, which can and do contribute to flow.  So I am obviously not "pretending" swaps don't matter.  My point remains: flow -- not stocks-- impact price.
1188 2018-04-16 12:45:03 Politics the only profession where it is ok to commit literal fraud.

1194 2018-04-16 12:39:36 Absolutely.  It’s not like the coffee is good anyway.  The only to impact these large companies is to hit their bottom line financially.  I’m sure their investors would live a 20% drop in stocks.

1272 2018-04-16 11:47:21 Vilage_idiot - Indeed.  Everyone is a genius at predicting things that have already happened.  GCI did recommend selling out but they also advised buying.  You can do very well on low quality stocks if you sell out in time but this is hard as they could blow up at any time.

1389 2018-04-16 09:55:03 I agree, earnings ultimately drive share prices.  Clearly the 1Q earnings and updates getting the tax cut boost, which is helpful.

1396 2018-04-16 09:50:22 I would of thought the costs could be significant.  For medium sized stocks the spread can be 2% and then you also have stamp duty and broker fees.  In addition you have slippage when buying or selling i.e. the shares go up or down when trying to do either.

I’m sure your staff has records of your opinions on stocks you comment on the LR, as well as stocks you like when you interview the CEO. 
You should do a new segment, say once a month where you discuss changes.

1904 2018-04-16 01:16:22 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

1941 2018-04-16 00:38:07 Guns do protect people no argument there. I disagree on the cost benefit but would settle for universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and banning enhancements like high cap magazines and bump stocks.

1960 2018-04-16 00:09:35 No doubt , they were sold hard.  It’s just hard to get the indices down.  Too many stocks will NOT disappoint, my thought. Market will rotate through and above 2700-2720 -that could be place to re short.
